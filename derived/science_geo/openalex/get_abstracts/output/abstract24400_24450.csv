https://openalex.org/W1995515835,"Putative Alzheimer disease (AD)-specific proteins (A68) were purified to homogeneity and shown to be major subunits of one form of paired helical filaments (PHFs). The amino acid sequence and immunological data indicate that the backbone of A68 is indistinguishable from that of the protein tau (τ), but A68 could be distinguished from normal human τ by the degree to which A68 was phosphorylated and by the specific residues in A68 that served as phosphate acceptors. The larger apparent relative molecular mass (Mr) of A68, compared to normal human τ, was attributed to abnormal phosphorylation of A68 because enzymatic dephosphorylation of A68 reduced its Mr to close to that of normal τ. Moreover, the LysSerProVal motif in normal human τ appeared to be an abnormal phosphorylation site in A68 because the Ser in this motif was a phosphate acceptor site in A68, but not in normal human τ. Thus, the major subunits of a class of PHFs are A68 proteins and the excessive or inappropriate phosphorylation of normal τ may change its apparent Mr, thus transforming τ into A68."

https://openalex.org/W1516558509,"We have purified three proteins from barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) seeds which synergistically inhibit the growth of fungi measured in a microtiter well assay. The proteins are a 26-kDa chitinase, a 30-kDa ribosome-inactivating protein, and a 32-kDa (1-3)-beta-glucanase. Full-length cDNAs encoding them were isolated and sequenced to determine the complete primary structures of the proteins. Northern hybridizations with the cDNAs as probes showed that the corresponding mRNAs accumulate differentially during seed development and germination. Chitinase mRNA accumulates to high levels in aleurone cells during late seed development and early germination, while high levels of mRNA encoding the ribosome-inactivating protein accumulate only in the starchy endosperm during late seed development. The glucanase mRNA accumulates to low levels during seed development and to higher levels in aleurone and seedling tissues during germination. Southern hybridizations showed that the three proteins are encoded by small families of three to eight genes. Their biological roles and potential use in genetic engineering studies are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2034271713,"Self-reactive B cells can be regulated by either deletion or inactivation. These manifestations of self-tolerance have been dramatically shown in transgenic mice in which the number of self-reactive cells has been artificially expanded. We have now extended these models to ask if B-cell tolerance as described for non-disease-associated antigens also operates for the targets of autoimmunity. The target we have chosen is DNA. Anti-DNA antibodies are diagnostic of certain autoimmune syndromes in humans and are a characteristic of the murine model of systemic autoimmunity, the MRl/lpr mouse. Antibodies to both single-stranded and double-stranded DNA have been implicated in disease. By generating anti-DNA transgenic mice, we have addressed the question of whether DNA-specific B cells are regulated in normal (non-autoimmune) mice. We indeed found that most transgenic B cells bind DNA, yet we failed to detect secreted anti-DNA. We suggest that as a consequence of their self-reactivity these B cells are developmentally arrested."
https://openalex.org/W1970224035,"To understand the principles of control and selectivity in gene expression, the biochemical mechanisms by which promoter- and enhancer-binding factors regulate transcription by RNA polymerase II were analyzed. A general observed repressor of transcription was purified and identified as histone H1. Since many aspects of H1 binding to naked DNA resemble its interaction with chromatin, purified H1 bound to naked DNA was used as a model for the repressed state of the DNA template. Three sequence-specific transcription factors, Sp1, GAL4-VP16, and GAGA factor, were shown to counteract H1-mediated repression (antirepression). In addition, Sp1 and GAL4-VP16, but not the GAGA factor, activated transcription in the absence of H1. Therefore, true activation and antirepression appear to be distinct activities of sequence-specific factors. Furthermore, transcription antirepression by GAL4-VP16 was sustained for several rounds of transcription. These findings, together with previous studies on H1, suggest that H1 participates in repression of the genome in the ground state and that sequence-specific transcription factors induce selected genes by a combination of true activation and release of basal repression that is mediated at least in part by H1."

https://openalex.org/W2069968362,"Apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) is a lipid-binding protein that participates in the transport of cholesterol and other lipids in the plasma. A complementary DNA clone for a protein that bound to regulatory elements of the apoAI gene was isolated. This protein, designated apoAI regulatory protein-1 (ARP-1), is a novel member of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily. ARP-1 bound to DNA as a dimer, and its dimerization domain was localized to the COOH-terminal region. ARP-1 also bound to a thyroid hormone-responsive element and to regulatory regions of the apoB, apoCIII, insulin, and ovalbumin genes. In cotransfection experiments, ARP-1 downregulated the apoAI gene. The involvement of ARP-1 in the regulation of apoAI gene expression suggests that it may participate in lipid metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis."

https://openalex.org/W1480098000,"Tetrahydrolipstatin (THL) is a selective inhibitor of fat absorption. In animal models, it has anti-obesity and anti-hypercholesterolemic activity and is presently in clinical trials for these indications. THL binds covalently to pancreatic lipase. Complete inhibition of lipolytic activity is obtained concomitant with the incorporation of 1 mol of THL/mol of enzyme. Pancreatic lipase is the best studied lipase, but published results concerning its catalytic mechanism are still controversial. In order to learn more about the inhibitory mechanism of THL, a selective lipase inhibitor interacting at or near the catalytic site, and therefore, to obtain more information on the catalytic mechanism of lipase, we have determined the amino acid residue to which THL is bound. After proteolytic degradation of porcine pancreatic lipase inhibited with radioactively labeled THL, the labeled peptides were isolated and analyzed by quantitative amino acid analysis, N-terminal sequencing, and by mass spectrometry with fast atom bombardment ionization. The data clearly show that THL is bound as an ester to the serine 152 of the lipase."
https://openalex.org/W2032849217,"Drosophila heat shock factor (HSF) exists as a multimer in solution and when bound to its regulatory element (HSE). We have previously reported evidence that subunits of HSF associate to form homotrimers and that each subunit contacts a conserved 5 bp DNA sequence repeated within an HSE. Here we show that HSF binding is highly cooperative at two distinct levels: between subunits of the HSF multimer, and between multimers. The binding of HSF to one of a pair of adjacent trimeric binding sites facilitates HSF binding to the second by over 2000-fold. This cooperativity is particularly important in binding HSF at 37 degrees C, and could account for the requirement for multiple binding sites in vivo and, in part, for the differential expression of heat shock genes."
https://openalex.org/W2077739943,"The c-fos serum response element (SRE) is a primary nuclear target for intracellular signal transduction pathways triggered by growth factors. It is the target for both protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent and -independent signals. Function of the SRE requires binding of a cellular protein, termed serum response factor (SRF). A second protein, p62TCF, recognizes the SRE-SRF complex to form a ternary complex. A mutated SRE that bound SRF but failed to form the ternary complex selectively lost response to PKC activators, but retained response to PKC-independent signals. Thus, two different signaling pathways act through discrete nuclear targets at the SRE. At least one of these pathways functions by recruitment of a pathway-specific accessory factor (p62TCF). These results offer a molecular mechanism to account for the biological specificity of signals that appear to act through common DNA sequence elements."
https://openalex.org/W2109044345,"Antigen processing requires intracellular antigen catabolism to generate immunogenic peptides that bind to class II MHC molecules (MHC-II) for presentation to T-cells. We now provide direct evidence that these peptides are produced within dense lysosomes, as opposed to earlier endocytic compartments. The protein antigen hen egg lysozyme was targeted to endosomes or lysosomes by encapsulating it in liposomes of different membrane composition. Acid-sensitive liposomes released their contents in early endosomes, whereas acid-resistant liposomes sequestered their contents from potential endosomal processing events and released their contents only after delivery to lysosomes. Antigen encapsulated in acid-resistant liposomes was processed in a chloroquine-sensitive manner and presented more efficiently than soluble antigen or antigen encapsulated in acid-sensitive liposomes. Thus, peptides may be recycled from lysosomes, transported to endosomes to bind MHC-II, and then expressed at the cell surface."
https://openalex.org/W2009654152,"Immature thymocytes, which coexpress CD4 and CD8, give rise to mature CD4+CD8− and CD4−CD8+ T cells. Only those T cells that recognize self-MHC are selected to mature, a process known as positive selection. The specificity of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) for class I or class II MHC influences the commitment to a CD4 or CD8 lineage. This may occur by a directed mechanism or by stochastic commitment followed by a selection step that allows only CD8+, class I-specific and CD4+, class II-specific cells to survive. We have generated a mouse line expressing a CD8 transgene under the control of the T cell-specific CD2 regulatory sequences. Although constitutive CD8 expression does not affect thymic selection of CD4+ cells, selection of a class I-specific TCR in the CD8 subset is substantially improved. This outcome is consistent with a model for positive selection in which selection occurs at a developmental stage in which both CD4 and CD8 are expressed, and positive selection by class I MHC generates an instructive signal that directs differentiation to a CD8 lineage."
https://openalex.org/W2080314452,"ToxR is a transmembrane, DNA-binding protein that can activate transcription of genes encoding cholera toxin (ctxAB). Here we characterize ToxS, a 19 kd transmembrane regulatory protein that interacts with ToxR and stimulates its activity. If a portion of the periplasmic domain of ToxR is deleted, productive interaction with ToxS is abolished. A ToxR-PhoA fusion protein that retains most of the ToxR periplasmic region remains dependent on ToxS for its ToxR activity. ToxS protects this fusion from proteolytic cleavage, suggesting that these two proteins interact within the periplasm. Mutations in a short cytoplasmic domain of ToxR were isolated that disrupt the periplasmic interaction between ToxR and ToxS. This domain is shared by other bacterial transcriptional activators, suggesting that it may play a common role in function of these proteins and in the molecular mechanism of signal transduction."
https://openalex.org/W1488674567,"Intracellular levels of guanosine 3‘,5‘-bispyrophosphate (ppGpp) governed by the relA gene are normally regulated by aminoacyl-tRNA availability for protein synthesis. An experimental system is described in which cellular levels of ppGpp are controlled instead by induction of plasmid pKK223-3 derivatives with the relA structural gene, or portions thereof, under control of the Ptac promoter. In amino acid-rich media, isopropyl-1-thio-beta-D-galactopyranoside induction of transcription of the wild type relA gene in pSM10 yields about a 100-fold overexpression of a metabolically stable, full length (743 amino acid) RelA protein to levels approximating the number of cellular ribosomes. This overexpression is accompanied by a roughly parallel and relC-dependent elevation of ppGpp levels. Induction of a relA gene deletion mutant in pSM11 containing 455 amino-terminal amino acids results in much lower levels of expression of a metabolically unstable 55-kDa protein and elevated ppGpp levels that are almost equivalent to induced pSM10 and are relC-independent. Induction of a larger deletion in pSM12 containing 331 amino-terminal amino acids does not provoke ppGpp accumulation. We are able to elicit high levels of ppGpp without changing nutritional abundance and without massive overexpression of the RelA protein by inducing the metabolically unstable, truncated RelA protein. We find the effects of elevated ppGpp levels to include a slowing of growth, an inhibition of stable RNA accumulation, an inhibition of cellular rrn P1 promoter activities as measured by primer extension, and changes in the pattern of gene expression viewed by two-dimensional electrophoresis of cellular proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1983880463,"To define the cis-acting DNA elements required for rhodopsin expression, we generated lines of transgenic mice carrying sequences upstream of the bovine rhodopsin gene fused to the E. coli beta-galactosidase gene (lacZ). Upstream sequences extending from -2174 to +70 bp, from -734 to +70 bp, and from -222 to +70 bp direct photoreceptor-specific expression. All three -2174 lines demonstrate a superior-temporal to inferior-nasal gradient of expression across the retina, whereas lines carrying the shorter constructs demonstrate either spatially continuous expression across the retina, discrete clusters of expression, or both. As a complementary approach to defining regulatory elements, we compared DNA sequences 5' of the murine, bovine, and human rhodopsin genes. Significant homology between all three species was found just upstream of the transcription start site and at approximately 1.5 kb upstream."
https://openalex.org/W1577792223,"A new member, hARF4, of the ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) family, a subset of the superfamily of regulatory GTP-binding proteins, has been cloned from a cDNA expression library. Two other human ARF cDNA sequences, designated human ARF1 and ARF3, have been reported previously and are 96% identical in amino acid sequence. A human ARF1 cDNA, significantly longer than previously described clones, was obtained, by cross-species hybridization using a bovine ARF1 cDNA probe. Bovine ARF1p and human ARF1p are 100% identical while each is only 80% identical to hARF4p. Thus, hARF4p is the most divergent of the mammalian ARF proteins identified. Northern blot analysis revealed the expression of at least three different ARF messages in human placenta and adrenal carcinoma cells. Both hARF1 and hARF4 encode GTP-binding proteins with predicted molecular masses of 20,000-21,000 Da. Biochemical analysis of the purified recombinant proteins revealed a high degree of conservation of nucleotide binding properties and in vitro ARF activities. ARF is an essential gene in the yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and is encoded by two genes. Expression of either hARF1p or hARF4p in yeast was found to rescue the lethal double mutant, arf1-arf2-, thus demonstrating the functional conservation of ARF functions between yeast and man. The combination of in vivo and in vitro assays for ARF function provides a specific and unambiguous means of determining bona fide ARF proteins from divergent species from among the rapidly increasing number of structurally related, small molecular weight GTP-binding proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1996432459,"We have examined the influence of retinal innervation on the development of target neurons in the first optic ganglion, the lamina, of D. melanogaster. Mitotically active lamina precursor cells (LPCs), which normally produce lamina neurons, are absent in mutants that lack retinal innervation, while other proliferative centers appear unaffected. Reducing the number of innervating photoreceptor axons results in fewer mitotic LPCs. In glass mutants photoreceptors project to abnormal locations and LPCs are found adjacent to these aberrant projections. We conclude that the arrival of photoreceptor axons in the larval brain initiates, directly or indirectly, cell division to produce lamina neurons. Our results provide an explanation for how the synchronous development of these two interacting systems is coordinated."
https://openalex.org/W2073747582,"Molecular mechanisms that mediate signal transduction by growth inhibitory cytokines are poorly understood. Type I (α and β) interferons (IFNs) are potent growth inhibitory cytokines whose biological activities depend on induced changes in gene expression. IFN-α induced the transient activation of phospholipase A2 in 3T3 fibroblasts and rapid hydrolysis of [3H]arachidonic acid (AA) from prelabeled phospholipid pools. The phospholipase inhibitor, bromophenacyl bromide (BPB), specifically blocked IFN-induced binding of nuclear factors to a conserved, IFN-regulated enhancer element, the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE). BPB also caused a dose-dependent inhibition of IFN-α-induced ISRE-dependent transcription in transient transfection assays. Specific inhibition of AA oxygenation by eicosatetraynoic acid prevented IFN-α induction of factor binding to the ISRE. Treatment of intact cells with inhibitors of fatty acid cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase enzymes resulted in amplification of IFN-α-induced ISRE binding and gene expression. Thus, IFN-α receptor-coupled AA hydrolysis may function in activation of latent transcription factors by IFN-α and provides a system for studying the role of AA metabolism in transduction of growth inhibitory signals."
https://openalex.org/W1546744738,"To identify amino acids of cytochrome P450d (P450d) which participate in the interaction with NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, we changed conserved ionic amino acids of P450d to others by site-directed mutagenesis. Turnover numbers (0.032-0.008 min-1) of purified mutants Lys94-Glu, Lys99-Glu, Lys105-Glu, Lys440-Glu, Lys453-Glu, Arg455-Glu, and Lys463-Glu toward 7-ethoxycoumarin were much lower than that (0.380 min-1) of the wild type at 25 degrees C. Reduction rates (less than 0.054 s-1) of the heme of all mutants (0.1 microM) in the presence of NADPH and the reductase (0.3 microM) were much lower than that (5.9 s-1) of the wild type. Furthermore, a turnover number (0.042 min-1) of a microsomal triple mutant (Arg135-Leu + Arg136-Leu + Arg137-Leu) of a conserved Arg cluster was much lower than that (0.674 min-1) of the wild type at 37 degrees C. Thus, we suggest that Lys94, Lys99, Lys105, Lys440, Lys453, Arg455, Lys463, and perhaps the Arg cluster Arg135-Arg136-Arg137 of P450d will participate in the intermolecular electron transfer process by forming ionic bridges between the two proteins and/or by orienting appropriate geometry for electron transfer on the interfacial surface between the two proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1557880133,"The role of endogenous arachidonic acid and its metabolites as mediators of cell growth was studied in rat mesangial cells. Inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase and lipoxygenase systems (nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA), SK&F 525A, and ketoconazole) significantly reduced serum-stimulated cell growth as determined by cell counts and incorporation of [3H]thymidine. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenases alone had no effect on cell growth. Stimulation with arginine vasopressin, epidermal growth factor, or phorbol myristate acetate increased [3H]thymidine incorporation and mRNA levels of the immediate-early response genes c-fos and Egr-1. These increases in [3H]thymidine incorporation and mRNA levels were reduced by NDGA and ketoconazole. NDGA, SK&F 525A, and ketoconazole had no effect on cellular ATP levels. Indomethacin had no effect upon cell growth. 14,15-Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid potentiated the effect of arginine vasopressin to enhance [3H]thymidine incorporation. Reverse-phase high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of lipid extracts from cells prelabeled with [3H]arachidonic acid resulted in the detection of a radioactive peak which eluted with lipoxygenase and monooxygenase products, with the same retention time as vicinal dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids. This peak increased after stimulation with arginine vasopressin or epidermal growth factor and was reduced by preincubation with NDGA. Furthermore, analysis of unlabeled cell extracts by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry revealed the presence of a compound with epoxyeicosatrienoic acid-like characteristics. These results indicate that mesangial cells in culture likely produce products of the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase system that are important endogenous mediators of the growth response to mitogenic agents."
https://openalex.org/W1524975259,"The largest subunit of eukaryotic RNA polymerase II contains a carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) which is comprised of repetitive heptapeptides with a consensus sequence Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7. We demonstrate here that the mouse CTD expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli can be phosphorylated in vitro by a p34cdc2/CDC28-containing CTD kinase from mouse ascites tumor cells. The product of this reaction, a phosphorylated form of the CTD, contains phosphoserine and phosphothreonine, but not phosphotyrosine. The same phosphoamino acid content is observed in the in vivo phosphorylated CTD from a mouse cell line. Synthetic peptides with naturally occurring non-consensus heptapeptide sequences can also be phosphorylated by CTD kinase in vitro. Phosphoamino acid analysis of these non-consensus heptapeptides together with direct sequencing of a phosphorylated heptapeptide reveals that serines (or threonines) at positions two and five are the sites phosphorylated by mouse CTD kinase. Thus, the -Ser(Thr)-Pro- motif common to p34cdc2/CDC28-containing protein kinases is the recognition site for mouse CTD kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2040590580,"The double mutation, D33H/P34S, reduced the transforming activity of oncogenic RasH proteins, G12V and Q61L, 400- and 20-fold, respectively. Remarkably, this same mutation did not reduce the transforming activity of normal RasH, nor did it impair the ability of the protein to restore a functional Ras pathway in cells whose endogenous Ras proteins were inhibited. Another mutation in this region, D38N, had similar effects. The mutations reduced downstream coupling efficiency of normal Ras as assessed by yeast adenylyl cyclase stimulation. However, this was offset by decreased GTPase activating protein (GAP) binding, since the latter resulted in elevated GTP-bound mutant Ras in cells. The mutations produced a similar decrease in downstream coupling efficiency of oncogenic Ras, but decreased GAP binding did not compensate because the GTPase activity of oncogenic Ras is not stimulated by GAP. These results imply that preferential inactivation of oncogenic Ras in human tumors may be achieved by reagents designed to inhibit the GAP-binding/""effector"" domain of Ras proteins."
https://openalex.org/W1597123682,"19F and 31P NMR spectroscopy was used to study the mechanism of activation of the alpha subunits of guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) by Al3+, Mg2+, and F-. 19F NMR spectra of solutions containing Al3+, Mg2+, and F- showed a characteristic F- peak at -10 ppm. Addition of the GDP-bound form of either of two G protein alpha subunits (G alpha) resulted in the appearance of an additional peak at -29 or -30 ppm. This peak was not observed with guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate-G alpha or with GDP alone. Titration of Al3+, Mg2+, and F- indicated that each molecule of G alpha binds 3-5 molecules of F- (Kd = 0.47 mM), a single molecule of Al3+ (Kd much less than 0.1 mM), and a single Mg2+ ion (Kd about 0.1 mM). Replacement of Mg2+ with Mn2+ caused a dramatic broadening of the NMR signal, indicating that the metal ion binds in proximity to the protein-bound F- (less than 1 nm). 31P NMR of GDP-G alpha showed peaks at -2 and -8.6 ppm, corresponding to the beta- and alpha-phosphoryl groups of GDP, respectively. Binding of Al3+, Mg2+, and F- caused an upfield shift of 6 ppm for the beta-phosphoryl signal with no change in the alpha-phosphoryl signal. These observations indicate that Mg2+.GDP.AlF3-5 mimics Mg2+.GTP in its capacity to activate G protein alpha subunits."
https://openalex.org/W1576416454,"Oscillation in [Ca2+]i induced by agonists has been described in many cell types and is thought to reflect Ca2+ release from and uptake into internal stores. We measured [Ca2+]i and Mn2+ entry in single cells of the pancreatic acinar cell line AR42J loaded with Fura 2 to examine the behavior of Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane (Ca2+ entry) during agonist-evoked [Ca2+]i oscillation. Addition of extracellular Ca2+ (Ca2+out) to agonist-stimulated cells bathed in Ca2(+)-free medium resulted in a marked [Ca2+]i increase blocked by La3+. The use of Mn2+ as a congener of Ca2+ to follow unidirectional Ca2+ movement reveals an oscillatory activation of Ca2+ entry by Ca2(+)-mobilizing agonists. The frequency at which Ca2+ entry oscillated matched the frequency of Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Ca2+ entry is activated after completion of Ca2+ release and is inactivated within the time span of each [Ca2+]i spike. These studies reveal a new aspect of [Ca2+]i oscillation in agonist-stimulated cells, that is the oscillatory activation of [Ca2+]i entry during [Ca2+]i oscillation."
https://openalex.org/W1608131302,"The cDNAs encoding seven low molecular weight (LMW) GTP-binding proteins were isolated from an electrode lobe library of the marine ray Discopyge ommata. Four were assigned as the ray homologues of previously identified LMW GTP-binding proteins rab1, ral, Krev, and rho. Three others showed unique sequences, including two exhibiting significant similarity to the yeast SEC4 protein. Northern analysis indicated that several of the transcripts are enriched in neural tissues with a moderate level of expression in cardiac muscle. This tissue distribution was corroborated with affinity purified antibodies against the LMW GTP-binding proteins. Subcellular fractionation revealed that the proteins co-purify with cholinergic synaptic vesicles. Immunohistochemical analysis confirms this localization. At least two of the proteins, oral and o-rho, are localized to the pre-synaptic terminals."
https://openalex.org/W2050773548,"The mouse brain K+ channel (MBK), previously cloned by others, has been independently cloned and shown to express in Xenopus oocytes. This K+ current (IK) inactivated over a time course of seconds and was sensitive to the K+ channel-blocking reagent tetraethylammonium. When the K+ channel was coexpressed with a cloned mouse brain serotonin receptor (5HT1c) in oocytes, activation of the 5HT1c receptor by a brief application of serotonin resulted in a suppression of the IK amplitude over the next 20 min. IK could also be suppressed by activation of G proteins. Suppression was also caused by intracellular Ca2+ injections and was blocked by intracellular injection of EGTA. Calmodulin antagonists block the IK suppression, but a known protein kinase inhibitor did not block suppression. The 5HT1c suppression was reversible; recovery from suppression was blocked by the protein kinase inhibitor H-7. These data suggest that the IK suppression occurs through a novel mechanism independent of A- or C-type protein kinases; suppression is best explained as being due to the action of a Ca2+/calmodulin-activated phosphatase; recovery from suppression is due to the action of a protein kinase."
https://openalex.org/W1528733643,"Limited proteolysis with trypsin of smg p21B, a ras p21-like small GTP-binding protein having the same putative effector domain as ras p21s, produced the N-terminal fragment and the C-terminal tail of Lys-Lys-Ser-Ser-geranylgeranyl-Cys methyl ester. The Mr values of the intact smg p21B, the N-terminal fragment, and the C-terminal tail were estimated to be about 22,000, 20,500, and less than 1,000, respectively, by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Both the GDP- and GTP-bound forms of the intact smg p21B bound to various membranes and phosphatidylserine-linked Affi-Gel. However, both the GDP- and GTP-bound forms of the N-terminal fragment failed to bind to membranes and phosphatidylserine-linked Affi-Gel. In contrast, the C-terminal tail bound to membranes and phosphatidylserine-linked Affi-Gel. The N-terminal fragment contained a GDP/GTP-binding and GTPase domain and exhibited these two activities, but the C-terminal tail did not show any such activity. A GTPase-activating protein for smg p21 stimulated the GTPase activity of both the intact smg p21B and the N-terminal fragment. In contrast, a GDP/GTP exchange protein for smg p21, named GDP dissociation stimulator, stimulated the GDP/GTP exchange reaction of the intact smg p21B but not that of the N-terminal fragment. These results indicate 1) that smg p21B is composed of at least two functionally different domains, the N-terminal GDP/GTP-binding and GTPase domain and the C-terminal membrane-binding domain, 2) that smg p21B binds to membranes through its C-terminal hydrophobic and basic domain, and 3) that this C-terminal domain is also essential for the smg p21 GDP dissociation stimulator action but not for the smg p21 GTPase-activating protein action."
https://openalex.org/W1510262705,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase (PAE) is a zinc metalloprotease with 301 amino acids. We have crystallized and solved the three-dimensional structure of PAE, using data to 1.5-A resolution, and have refined the native molecular structure to R = 0.188. The overall tertiary structure of the PAE molecule is similar to that of thermolysin, with which it shares 28% amino acid sequence identity. Nearly all of the active site residues that might potentially interact with substrates are identical in the two proteins. However, the active site cleft is significantly more open in PAE than in thermolysin."

https://openalex.org/W1566533641,"The guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G proteins) that couple hormone and other receptors to a variety of intracellular effector enzymes and ion channels are heterotrimers of alpha, beta, and gamma subunits. One way to study the interfaces between subunits is to analyze the consequences of chemically cross-linking them. We have used 1,6-bismaleimidohexane (BMH), a homobifunctional cross-linking reagent that reacts with sulfhydryl groups, to cross-link alpha to beta subunits of Go and Gi-1. Two cross-linked products are formed from each G protein with apparent molecular masses of 140 and 122 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Both bands formed from Go reacted with anti-alpha o and anti-beta antibody. The mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is anomalous since the undenatured, cross-linked proteins have the same Stokes radius as the native, uncross-linked alpha beta gamma heterotrimer. Therefore, each cross-linked product contains one alpha and one beta subunit. Activation of Go by guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTP gamma S) does not prevent cross-linking of alpha to beta gamma, consistent with an equilibrium between associated and dissociated subunits even in the presence of GTP gamma S. The same cross-linked products of Go are formed in brain membranes reacted with BMH as are formed in solution, indicating that the residues cross-linked by BMH in the pure protein are accessible when Go is membrane bound. Analysis of tryptic peptides formed from the cross-linked products indicates that the alpha subunit is cross-linked to the 26-kDa carboxyl-terminal portion of the beta subunit. The cross-linked G protein is functional, and its alpha subunit can change conformation upon binding GTP gamma S. GTP gamma S stabilizes alpha o to digestion by trypsin (Winslow, J.W., Van Amsterdam, J.R., and Neer, E.J. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 7571-7579) and also stabilizes the alpha subunit in the cross-linked product. Cross-linked G o can be ADP-ribosylated by pertussis toxin. This ADP-ribosylation is inhibited by GTP gamma S with a concentration dependence that is indistinguishable from that of the control, uncross-linked G o. These two kinds of experiments indicate that alpha o is able to change its conformation even though it cannot separate completely from beta gamma. Thus, although dissociation of the subunits accompanies activation of G o in solution, it is not obligatory for a conformational change to occur in the alpha subunit."
https://openalex.org/W1995716801,"Use of primary culture cells has been limited by the inability to purify most types of cells, particularly cells from early developmental stages. In whole animal cell sorting (WACS), live cells derived from animals harboring a lacZ transgene are purified according to their level of beta-galactosidase expression with a fluorogenic beta-galactosidase substrate and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. With WACS, incipient posterior compartment cells that express the engrailed gene were purified from early Drosophila embryos. Neuronal precursor cells were also purified, and they differentiated into neurons with high efficiency in culture. Because there are many lacZ strains, it may be possible to purify most types of Drosophila cells. The same approach is also applicable to other organisms for which germ-line transformation is possible."
https://openalex.org/W1533248454,"Protein p5 is a Bacillus subtilis phage phi 29-encoded protein required for phi 29 DNA replication in vivo. Protein p5 has single-stranded DNA binding (SSB) capacity and stimulates in vitro DNA replication severalfold when phi 29 DNA polymerase is used to replicate either the natural phi 29 DNA template or primed M13 single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Furthermore, other SSB proteins, including Escherichia coli SSB, T4 gp32, adenovirus DNA-binding protein, and human replication factor A, can functionally substitute for protein p5. The stimulatory effect of phi 29 protein p5 is not due to an increase of the DNA replication rate. When both phi 29 DNA template and M13 competitor ssDNA are added simultaneously to the replication reaction, phi 29 DNA replication is strongly inhibited. This inhibition is fully overcome by adding protein p5, suggesting that protein p5-coated M13 ssDNA is no longer able to compete for replication factors, probably phi 29 DNA polymerase, which has a strong affinity for ssDNA. Electron microscopy demonstrates that protein p5 binds to M13 ssDNA forming saturated complexes with a smoothly contoured appearance and producing a 2-fold reduction of the DNA length. Protein p5 also binds to ssDNA in the phi 29 replicative intermediates produced in vitro, which are similar in structure to those observed in vivo. Our results strongly suggest that phi 29 protein p5 is the phi 29 SSB protein active during phi 29 DNA replication."
https://openalex.org/W1580675773,"Nitrous oxide reductase, which catalyzes the reduction of N2O to N2, was purified in a largely oxidized form from Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain P2 by a simple anaerobic procedure to yield an enzyme with a peptide purity of 95-98%. For the native (dimeric) enzyme, Mr = 120,000 and for the denatured subunit, Mr = 73,000. The enzyme contained four Cu atoms/subunit, was purple in color, and exhibited a broad absorption band at 550 nm with an extinction coefficient of about 11,000 M-1 x cm-1 referenced to the dimer. It was nearly inactive as prepared but could be activated by incubation with 2-(N-cyclohexylamino)ethane sulfonate buffer, pH 10, to specific activities as high as 27 mumol of N2O x min-1 x mg-1.Km for N2O and benzyl viologen radical cation was about 2 and 4 microM, respectively, both before and after enzyme activation. Activation increased the t1/2 for turnover-dependent inactivation from about 30 s to 5-10 min. Reduction of the enzyme by dithionite was kinetically biphasic and resulted in the loss of the 550-nm band and ultimate appearance of a 670-nm band. Isoelectric focusing revealed five components with pI values from 5.2 to 5.7. The pI values did not change following activation. The copper CD spectrum of the enzyme as prepared was different from that for the activated enzyme, whereas those for the enzyme after exposure to air and the activated enzyme were similar. Because the activated enzyme is a mixture of activated and inactive species, the specific activity of the activated species must be substantially greater than the observed value. Molecular heterogeneity may also explain the decreased optical absorbance and CD amplitude that resulted from the activation process. The data overall reinforce the view that the absorption spectrum of nitrous oxide reductase is not a good predictor of absolute activity."
https://openalex.org/W1560739022,"Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) regulates a variety of immunoregulatory functions through the induction of a specific set of IFN-gamma response genes. This includes the invariant chain associated with the major histocompatibility complex class II molecules. To investigate the mechanism involved in the invariant chain (In) response to IFN-gamma we constructed chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) hybrid genes in which the CAT gene is under the control of the In promoter. The glioblastoma cell line, U-373 MG, transfected with a CAT construct having the In promoter sequence -790 to +1 bp showed over 3-fold increased CAT activity when treated with IFN-gamma indicating that this region confers IFN-gamma responsiveness to the CAT gene. The IFN-gamma response element in the promoter was further sublocalized to the region -120 to -61 base pairs (bp). This region contains homology to the interferon-stimulated response elements identified in other IFN responsive genes. By gel shift analyses, an IFN-gamma-induced sequence-specific DNA-binding factor was identified. This induced complex binds to an oligonucleotide corresponding to -107 to -79 bp of the In promoter. Mutations of this binding site at -94 and -92 bp drastically decreased binding of the constitutive and IFN-gamma-induced complexes. This IFN-gamma induced factor also binds to an oligonucleotide corresponding to -91 to -62 bp of the interferon-beta (IFN-beta) gene promoter, a region necessary for the induction of the IFN-beta gene by virus and double-stranded RNA. This binding specificity is characteristic of a family of DNA binding factors that bind both the interferon-stimulated response elements and the IFN-beta gene promoter."
https://openalex.org/W1582088706,"Kirsten-ras is the oncogene most frequently activated in human tumors. Studies of its biological function have been limited by the nonavailability of significant amounts of the major protein product, Kirsten-ras (4B) p21. When expressed in Escherichia coli K12, the recombinant protein was rapidly cleaved upon cell lysis in the lysine-rich C terminus region, probably by the ompT protease. However, soluble full-length protein was obtained when the Kirsten-ras gene was expressed in an E. coli strain lacking the ompT gene, and also in a baculovirus/insect cell expression system. Additionally, the baculovirus/insect cell system produced about half of the Kirsten-ras protein in a membrane-associated form, which was post-translationally modified by polyisoprenylation and carboxyl-methylation. A C-terminally truncated form (residues 1-166) was also expressed at high levels in E. coli for x-ray crystallographic studies. The kinetics of GDP release and of GTP hydrolysis of the purified proteins are similar to those of the corresponding Harvey-ras proteins, though there are small differences in the relative affinities for GDP and GTP. Biological activity of full-length Kirsten Val-12 p21 was demonstrated by microinjection into Swiss 3T3 cells, resulting in morphological transformation, with a lower potency than that of Harvey Val-12 protein."
https://openalex.org/W1546578920,"Abstract Heterotrimeric G-proteins function as signal transducers for a variety of hormone-coupled enzyme and ion transport systems in eukaryotic cells. We have studied G-protein-coupled processes that appear to be developmentally regulated in polarized pig kidney cells (LLC-PK1). Following trypsinization, LLC-PK1 cells differentiate from a rounded cell type to a fully polarized epithelium by 7 days of culture. During this differentiation, the expression of G-protein alpha i-2 subunit mRNA was not detected until day 4 of culture, it peaked at day 6, and declined thereafter. In contrast, G-protein alpha s subunit mRNA which peaked on day 4 was easily detected on all culture days. The presence of the alpha i-2 protein on epithelial cell basolateral membranes followed the same pattern of mRNA expression during culture. To understand the developmental expression of the alpha i-2 subunit in non-polarized cells and its potential regulation by hormones and second messengers in polarized cells at the transcriptional level, genomic DNA segments encoding the alpha i-2 gene promoter were isolated from an EMBL-3 porcine genomic library. S1 nuclease analysis of LLC-PK1 mRNA with cRNA probes derived from these DNA segments revealed major and a minor transcriptional start sites 131 and 171 base pairs upstream of the translation initiation site. The porcine and human alpha i-2 subunit genes shared a 78% sequence identity in their 5' flanks which suggested an evolutionary conservation of cis elements required to influence their transcription. The porcine alpha i-2 gene promoter was identified by fusing DNA segments encoding putative 5'-flanking areas of the gene to a plasmid that contained a firefly luciferase reporter gene but lacked a promoter. The minimal promoter was found between -130 and -60 base pairs from the major transcription start site. No typical TATA-like sequences were found. However, a GC box and a TGTGG sequence were two potential cis elements required for basal transcription of the porcine gene promoter which shared a 76% sequence identity to the promoter of another GTP-binding protein, the human c-Ha-ras proto-oncogene. Transcription of the gene was inhibited following treatment of renal cells with 10(-8) M dexamethasone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)"

https://openalex.org/W1485977198,"In several tissues and cell lines, serine utilized for phosphatidylserine (PS) synthesis is an eventual precursor of the base moiety of ethanolamine phosphoglycerides (PE). We investigated the biosynthesis and decarboxylation of PS in cultured C6 glioma cells, with particular attention to 1-O-alk-1'-enyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (plasmenylethanolamine) biosynthesis. Incorporation of [3H]serine into PS reached a maximum within 4-8 h, and label in nonplasmenylethanolamine phosphoglyceride (NP-PE) and plasmenylethanolamine was maximal by 12-24 h and 48 h, respectively. After 8 h, label in PS decreased even though 40-60% of initial label remained in the culture medium. Serial additions of fresh [3H]serine restored PS synthesis to higher levels of labeled PS accumulation followed by a subsequent decrease in 4-8 h. High performance liquid chromatographic analyses confirmed that medium serine was depleted by 8 h, and thereafter metabolites, including acetate and formate, accounted for radioactivity in the medium. The rapid but transient appearance of labeled glycine and ATP inside the cells indicated conversion of serine by hydroxymethyltransferase. 78-85% of label from serine was in headgroup of PS or of PE formed by decarboxylation. A precursor-product relationship was suggested for label from [3H]serine appearing in the headgroup of diacyl, alkylacyl, and alkenylacyl subclasses of PE. By 48 h, a constant specific activity, ratio of approximately 1:1 was reached between plasmenylethanolamine and NP-PE, similar to the molar distribution of these lipids. In contrast, equilibrium was not achieved in cells incubated with [1,2-14C]ethanolamine; plasmenylethanolamine had 2-fold greater specific activity than labeled NP-PE by 72-96 h. These observations indicate that in cultured glioma cells 1) serine serves as a precursor of the head group of PS and of both plasmenyl and non-plasmenyl species of PE; 2) exchange of headgroup between NP-PE and plasmenylethanolamine may involve different donor pools of PE depending on whether the headgroup originates with exogenous serine or ethanolamine; 3) serine is rapidly converted to other metabolites, which limits exogenous serine as a direct phospholipid precursor."

Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis yielded a single band with an estimated molecular mass of greater than 300,000 Da. N-Linked carbohydrate was present, accounting for approximately 10% of the total mass of the molecule. The purified protein specifically bound PE. Incubation of purified protein specifically bound PE. Incubation of purified PE binding protein with toxin reduced toxicity to LM cells.

https://openalex.org/W1551135291,"The amino acid sequences of cellulase from Bacillus subtilis (BSC) and that from an alkalophilic Bacillus sp. N-4 (NK1) show significant homology in most parts except for the C-terminal portions. Despite the high homology, the pH activity profiles of the two enzymes are quite different; BSC has its optimum pH at 6-6.5, whereas NK1 is active over a broad pH range from 6 to 10.5. In order to identify the structural features which determine such pH activity profiles, chimeric cellulases between BSC and NK1 were constructed using four restriction sites commonly present within the homologous coding sequences, and were produced in Escherichia coli. The chimeric cellulases showed various chromatographic behaviors, reflecting the origins of their C-terminal regions. The pH activity profiles of the chimeric enzymes in the alkaline range could be classified into either the BSC or NK1 type mainly depending on the origins of the fifth C-terminal regions. In the acidic range, the profile was determined only by the origin of the fourth enzyme region from the N terminus. Comparison of the kinetic parameters between pH 5 and 6 using p-nitrophenyl cellobioside as a substrate indicated that the fourth region is responsible for the pH-dependent change of the kcat value. Only a limited number of amino acids in the fourth region may affect on deprotonation of catalytic residues of the cellulases and modulate the catalytic activity in the acidic pH values."
https://openalex.org/W1565940917,"High affinity murine anti-fluorescein monoclonal antibody (Mab) 4-4-20 (K alpha = 1.3 x 10(10) M-1; IgG2a; kappa), affinity labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (I), served as the immunogen to elicit a xenogenic (rabbit) polyclonal reagent in a rabbit specific for the liganded state. The reagent did not bind Mab 4-4-20 in its nonliganded (idiotypic) conformation and demonstrated no reactivity with fluorescein ligand. Interaction of the anti-metatype reagent with liganded 4-4-20 caused a significant decrease in the dissociation rate of fluorescyl ligand bound to Mab 4-4-20 and a single-chain antibody derivative of 4-4-20. Additionally, most members of the 4-4-20 idiotype family displayed the same kinetic effect in the presence of anti-metatype. Members most closely related to Mab 4-4-20 (based on concentration in Mab required to inhibit the 4-4-20 idiotype/4-4-20 anti-idiotype interaction 50%) showed relatively greater decreases in the dissociation rate, establishing a quantitative correlation between idiotype and metatype. The immunologically distinct metatypic state is discussed in terms of conformational changes in or near the active site upon binding ligand, possibly involving two amino acid residues which close off the mouth of the antibody-active site upon binding fluorescein."
https://openalex.org/W1592461052,"Regulation of glycogenolysis in skeletal muscle is dependent on a network of interacting enzymes and effectors that determine the relative activity of the enzyme phosphorylase. That enzyme is activated by phosphorylase kinase and inactivated by protein phosphatase-1 in a cyclic process of covalent modification. We present evidence that the cyclic interconversion is subject to zero-order ultrasensitivity, and the effect is responsible for the flash activation of phosphorylase by Ca2+ in the presence of glycogen. The zero-order effect is observable either by varying the amounts of kinase and phosphatase or by modifying the ratio of their activities by a physiological effector, protein phosphatase inhibitor-2. The sensitivity of the system is enhanced in the presence of the phosphorylase limit dextrin of glycogen which lowers the Km of phosphorylase kinase for phosphorylase. The in vitro experimental results are examined in terms of physiological conditions in muscle, and it is shown that zero-order ultrasensitivity would be more pronounced under the highly compartmentalized conditions found in that tissue. The sensitivity of this system to effector changes is much greater than that found for allosteric enzymes. Furthermore, the sensitivity enhancement increases more rapidly than energy consumption (ATP) as the phosphorylase concentration increases. Energy effectiveness is shown to be a possible evolutionary factor in favor of the development of zero-order ultrasensitivity in compartmentalized systems."
https://openalex.org/W1625589417,"Muscarinic receptor properties in rat cortical and brain stem synaptoneurosomes and in heart myocytes were examined at resting potential and at depolarization. Depolarization induced the conversion of agonist-binding sites of the receptor from a high to a low affinity state, which could be reversed by a return to resting potential. No effect was observed on the affinity of the receptor for antagonists. Pertussis-toxin (PTX)-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of all substrates in both synaptoneurosomal and myocyte membranes, when conducted at resting potential, prevented depolarization-induced conversion of the receptor affinity in these preparations. The target substrates were identified by [32P]ADP-ribosylation of membranes prepared from brain stem synaptoneurosomes. Autoradiography revealed labeling of a 39-kDa protein band, which reacted mainly with antibodies to the alpha-subunit of Go-proteins. The possible involvement of G-proteins in depolarization-induced changes in the receptor activity was further investigated by examining the effect of membrane potential on the PTX-sensitive binding of di- and triphosphated guanine nucleotides to synaptoneurosomal membranes. Brain stem synaptoneurosomes were made permeable to guanine nucleotides ([3H]GTP, [3H]GDP, [3H]5'-guanylyl imidodiphosphate) by treatment with ATP. After the synaptoneurosomes had been loaded with labeled GTP/GDP, resealed, and then subjected to either resting potential of short depolarization, binding of [3H]GDP to the membranes of depolarized synaptoneurosomes was 4.0 +/- 0.3 (n = 20) times higher than to the membranes of synaptoneurosomes at resting potential. Repolarization reversed this effect. Enhancement of [3H]GDP binding to the synaptoneurosomal membranes was induced also by muscarinic activation, although the increase obtained was only 30-40% (n = 5) relative to [3H]GDP binding at resting potential. Both the depolarization-induced and the muscarinically-induced enhancement of [3H]GDP binding were prevented following PTX-catalyzed ADP-ribosylation of G-proteins in the synaptoneurosomal membrane. Our results suggest that the depolarization-induced enhancement in the binding of [3H]GTP/[3H]GDP may be attributable to activation of PTX-sensitive G-proteins, which mediate the depolarization-induced alteration of the affinity of the muscarinic receptor for agonists."
https://openalex.org/W1566288265,"The energization of System A in cultured human fibroblasts has been studied by measuring the energy transfer from the electrochemical gradient of Na+ to the chemical gradient of the site A-specific substrate amino acid 2-methylaminoisobutyric acid. The co-transport Na+/amino acid, studied by kinetic analysis and radiochemical measurements, showed a coupling ratio of 1:1. The assessment of the Na+ electrochemical gradient in cultured adherent cells relied on the development of noninvasive procedures as follows: the membrane electrical potential was estimated from the accumulation of L-arginine at equilibrium (Bussolati, O., Laris, P. C., Nucci, F. A., Dall'Asta, V., Longo, N., Guidotti, G. G., and Gazzola, G. C. (1987) Am. J. Physiol. 253, C391-C397); the chemical gradient of Na+ was determined from spectrometric measurements of Na+. The accumulation of 2-methylaminoisobutyric acid was strongly sensitive to changes of Na+ gradient and of membrane electrical potential, indicating that the electrochemical gradient of Na+ contributed energy for the uphill transport of the amino acid through System A. Changes in the Na+ electrochemical gradient were obtained by: (i) alterations of extracellular concentration of Na+; (ii) changes of membrane electrical potential obtained by variation of extracellular [K+]; and (iii) changes of [Na+]in and membrane electrical potential upon incubation of the cells in serum-free saline solutions (Dall'Asta, V., Gazzola, G. C., Longo, N., Bussolati, O., Franchi-Gazzola, R., and Guidotti, G. G. (1986) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 860, 1-8). The correlation between the chemical gradient of 2-methylaminoisobutyric acid and the Na+ electrochemical potential followed a straight line with a yield close to the thermodynamic equilibrium, thus suggesting that the energy stored in the gradient of Na+ electrochemical potential is fully adequate to energize the intracellular accumulation of site A-reactive amino acids in human fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W1606033877,"The binding of carbon dioxide to human hemoglobin cross-linked between Lys alpha 99 residues with bis(3,5-di-bromosalicyl) fumarate was measured using manometric techniques. The binding of CO2 to unmodified hemoglobin can be described by two classes of sites with high and low affinities corresponding to the amino-terminal valines of the beta and alpha chains, respectively (Perrella, M., Kilmartin, J. V., Fogg, J., and Rossi-Bernardi, L. (1975b) Nature 256, 759-761. The cross-linked hemoglobin bound less CO2 than native hemoglobin at all CO2 concentrations in deoxygenated and liganded conformations, and the ligand-linked effect was reduced. Fitting the data to models of CO2 binding suggests that only half of the expected saturation with CO2 is possible. The remaining binding is described by a single affinity constant that for cross-linked deoxyhemoglobin is about two-thirds of the high affinity constant for deoxyhemoglobin A and that for cross-linked cyanomethemoglobin is equal to the high affinity constant for unmodified cyanomethemoglobin A or carbonmonoxyhemoglobin A. The low affinity binding constant for cross-linked hemoglobin in both the deoxygenated and liganded conformations is close to zero, which is significantly less than the affinity constants for either subunit binding site in unmodified hemoglobin. Comparing the low affinity sites in this modified hemoglobin to native hemoglobin suggests that cross-linking hemoglobin between Lys alpha 99 residues prevents CO2 binding at the alpha-subunit NH2 termini."
https://openalex.org/W1549177426,"Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is a glycoprotein hormone composed of two different subunits designated FSH-alpha and FSH-beta. Using synthetic peptides corresponding to the primary structure of human (h) FSH-beta subunit, we previously identified two regions of the beta-subunit, hFSH-(33-53) and hFSH-(81-95), as receptor binding regions. In this report, we tested the ability of synthetic peptides to interact with hFSH-alpha-subunit. Synthetic peptides corresponding to hFSH-beta-(11-25), (41-55), (51-65), and (101-111) were able to bind specifically radioiodinated hFSH-alpha-subunit, suggesting that they represent regions of interaction with the alpha-subunit. These experimental results were in agreement with the location of alpha-subunit contact regions predicted by sequence analysis. Peptides of hFSH-beta-subunit showing maximum specific binding to the alpha-subunit were those possessing minimum interaction with receptor whereas those not binding to alpha-subunit corresponded to regions shown to interact with receptor (hFSH-beta-(33-53) and hFSH-beta-(81-95]. The hFSH-beta-subunit, therefore, seems to have two discontinuous receptor binding regions flanked by three alpha-subunit contact regions."

Cells were studied freshly isolated (resting), and following culture both unstimulated (control) and stimulated with concanavalin A (ConA) or phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) + ionomycin. Both resting and control cells from diabetic (BBd) and diabetes-prone (BBdp) rats transported more (p less than 0.05) 2-dGlc than did cells from nondiabetes-prone (BBn) rats. Consistent with prior in vivo activation, sustained in vitro, lactate production was higher (p less than 0.05) under control conditions in BBd and BBdp than in BBn cells. Lactate production increased less with ConA and PMA + ionomycin in both BBd and BBdp than in BBn cells. PMA + ionomycin increased 2-dGlc uptake as much in BBd and BBdp cells as in BBn cells. Elevated rates of pyruvate production were observed in BBd cells under resting, control, and (especially) ConA conditions, suggesting an abnormality in pyruvate conversion to lactate. Few changes were observed in 14CO2 production. The presence of similar abnormalities in BBdp cells to those of the BBd cells suggests that the diabetic state is not causal, and the absence of an in vitro effect of 15 mmol/liter glucose in BBn cells further tends to exclude hyperglycemia as a cause of these alterations."
