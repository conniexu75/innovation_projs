The liver-specific microRNA-122 (miR-122) is frequently suppressed in primary hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). In situ hybridization demonstrated that miR-122 is abundantly expressed in hepatocytes but barely detectable in primary human HCCs. Ectopic expression of miR-122 in nonexpressing HepG2, Hep3B, and SK-Hep-1 cells reversed their tumorigenic properties such as growth, replication potential, clonogenic survival, anchorage-independent growth, migration, invasion, and tumor formation in nude mice. Further, miR-122-expressing HCC cells retained an epithelial phenotype that correlated with reduced Vimentin expression. ADAM10 (a distintegrin and metalloprotease family 10), serum response factor (SRF), and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (Igf1R) that promote tumorigenesis were validated as targets of miR-122 and were repressed by the microRNA. Conversely, depletion of the endogenous miR-122 in Huh-7 cells facilitated their tumorigenic properties with concomitant up-regulation of these targets. Expression of SRF or Igf1R partially reversed tumor suppressor function of miR-122. Further, miR-122 impeded angiogenic properties of endothelial cells in vitro. Notably, ADAM10, SRF, and Igf1R were up-regulated in primary human HCCs compared with the matching liver tissue. Co-labeling studies demonstrated exclusive localization of miR-122 in the benign livers, whereas SRF predominantly expressed in HCC. More importantly, growth and clonogenic survival of miR-122-expressing HCC cells were significantly reduced upon treatment with sorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor clinically effective against HCC. Collectively, these results suggest that the loss of multifunctional miR-122 contributes to the malignant phenotype of HCC cells, and miR-122 mimetic alone or in combination with anticancer drugs can be a promising therapeutic regimen against liver cancer.

Although most prevalent in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, the incidence of HCC in the United States is on the rise, and among men, it is the fastest growing cause of cancer-related death (1.El-Serag H.B. Rudolph K.L. Gastroenterology. 2007; 132: 2557-2576Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4332) Google Scholar). The major risk factors are hepatitis B and C virus infection, alcohol abuse, xenobiotics, primary biliary cirrhosis, diabetes, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and genetic disorders like hemochromatosis and α1-antitrypsin deficiency. The high mortality rate is due to its detection at the late stage with limited therapeutic options. The 5-year survival rate for liver cancer is only 5%, and the death rate is predicted to increase significantly in the next decade. Although primary HCCs are the most common form of liver cancer (>90%), liver malignancies can also be caused by metastasis of colon, prostate, or breast carcinomas. The disease is progressive and death usually occurs within 10 months of the initial diagnosis. hepatocellular carcinoma microRNA-122 serum response factor in situ hybridization with locked nucleic acid modified antisense probe deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor untranslated region human dermal microvascular endothelial cell(s) formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded reverse transcription glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide mitogen-activated protein kinase. Although the molecular mechanism of liver tumorigenesis at the genetic level has been studied well, other potential mechanisms for hepatocarcinogenesis are only beginning to emerge. In recent years, there has been considerable interest in understanding the role of microRNAs in cancer (2.Visone R. Petrocca F. Croce C.M. Gastroenterology. 2008; 135: 1866-1869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 3.Braconi C. Patel T. Hepatology. 2008; 47: 1807-1809Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). MicroRNAs, which encode small noncoding RNAs of ∼21 nucleotides, are now recognized as a large gene family expressed in plants, animals, and viruses as well as in unicellular algae (4.Bartel D.P. Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15352) Google Scholar, 5.Kim V.N. Han J. Siomi M.C. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2009; 10: 126-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (2503) Google Scholar). MicoRNAs act in concert to regulate expression of myriad target proteins either by impeding their translation or destabilizing their mRNAs (6.Filipowicz W. Bhattacharyya S.N. Sonenberg N. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (4054) Google Scholar). Most animal microRNAs are evolutionarily conserved and often found in clusters (7.Kim V.N. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 376-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (1945) Google Scholar). Primary microRNAs with the stem-loop structure are transcribed by RNA polymerase II or RNA polymerase III and are processed both in the nucleus and cytoplasm by RNase III like enzymes such as Drosha and Dicer and associated co-factors to generate mature microRNAs. The mature microRNAs are recognized by specific proteins to form a microRNA-induced silencing complex, which facilitates its interaction with the cognate sequence predominantly located in the 3′-UTR of target mRNAs. Dysregulation of microRNA expression occurs in different diseases including cancer, and certain microRNAs function as oncogenes or tumor suppressors (8.Calin G.A. Croce C.M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2006; 6: 857-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (6466) Google Scholar). miR-122 was identified as the most abundant liver-specific microRNA, constituting 70% of total hepatic microRNA while cloning small RNAs from different tissues in mice (9.Chang J. Guo J.T. Jiang D. Guo H. Taylor J.M. Block T.M. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 8215-8223Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 10.Lagos-Quintana M. Rauhut R. Yalcin A. Meyer J. Lendeckel W. Tuschl T. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 735-739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2694) Google Scholar). Expression of this evolutionary conserved microRNA starts during gestation and attains a maximal level in the adult liver. miR-122 facilitates replication (11.Jopling C.L. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2008; 36: 1220-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and translation (12.Henke J.I. Goergen D. Zheng J. Song Y. Schüttler C.G. Fehr C. Jünemann C. Niepmann M.

Nature. 2005; 438: 685-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (3289) Google Scholar). Microarray analysis of hepatic RNA from mice depleted of miR-122 by antagomirs has shown that most of the genes induced upon miR-122 depletion are normally repressed in the liver, implicating dedifferentiation of hepatocytes (15.Krützfeldt J. Kuwajima S. Braich R. Rajeev K.G. Pena J. Tuschl T. Manoharan M. Stoffel M. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 2885-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Its expression has been shown to be regulated by circadian rhythm (16.Gatfield D. Le Martelot G. Vejnar C.E. Gerlach D. Schaad O. Fleury-Olela F. Ruskeepää A.L. Oresic M. Esau C.C. Zdobnov E.M. Schibler U. Genes Dev. 2009; 23: 1313-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). miR-122 level is very high in mouse and human hepatocytes, but it is either silent or expressed at a very low level in most HCCs and transformed cell lines (9.Chang J. Guo J.T. Jiang D. Guo H. Taylor J.M. Block T.M. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 8215-8223Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). We are the first to report that miR-122 is down-regulated in the preneoplasic nodules and HCCs developed in rats fed choline deficient diet as well as in primary human HCCs (17.Kutay H. Bai S. Datta J. Motiwala T. Pogribny I. Frankel W. Jacob S.T. Ghoshal K. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 99: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Recently it has been shown that a loss of miR-122 expression correlates with poor prognosis and metastasis of liver cancer (18.Coulouarn C. Factor V.M. Andersen J.B. Durkin M.E. Thorgeirsson S.S. Oncogene. 2009; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Fornari F. Gramantieri L. Giovannini C. Veronese A. Ferracin M. Sabbioni S. Calin G.A. Grazi G.L. Croce C.M. Tavolari S. Chieco P. Negrini M. Bolondi L. Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 5761-5767Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 20.Tsai W.C. Hsu P.W. Lai T.C. Chau G.Y. Lin C.W. Chen C.M. Lin C.D. Liao Y.L. Wang J.L. Chau Y.P. Hsu M.T. Hsiao M. Huang H.D. Tsou A.P. Hepatology. 2009; 49: 1571-1582Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). It is also suppressed in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which often leads to liver cancer (21.Cheung O. Puri P. Eicken C. Contos M.J. Mirshahi F. Maher J.W. Kellum J.M. Min H. Luketic V.A. Sanyal A.J. Hepatology. 2008; 48: 1810-1820Crossref PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Thus, it is logical to conceive that the loss of function of miR-122 can predispose hepatocytes to neoplastic transformation. Here, we examined the tumor suppressor properties of miR-122 in vitro in HCC cells in culture and in nude mice and identified its targets that may play a causal role in hepatocarcinogenesis. Furthermore, our data also show that miR-122 potentiates growth inhibitory function of sorafenib in HCC cells. Human HCC cell lines (HepG2, Hep3B, and SK-Hep-1) obtained from ATCC were cultured according to the protocol provided by the supplier. The cells were harvested for RNA isolation, and whole cell extracts were subjected to Western blot analysis. Primary human hepatocellular cancer and adjacent normal tissue samples were obtained from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network at The Ohio State University James Cancer Hospital. Tissue specimens were procured in accordance with The Ohio State University Cancer Internal Review Board guidelines. HepG2-tet-off cells obtained from Clontech were cultured according to the supplier's protocol. HCC cells were treated with different concentrations of sorafenib (purchased from LC Biochemical) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Primary human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMEC) purchased from Biowhittaker (Walkersville, MD) were maintained in endothelial cell basal medium-2 containing 5% fetal bovine serum and growth supplements. Generation of stable HCC cell lines expressing miR-122 is described in the supplemental “Materials and Methods.” MicroRNA was isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFP) blocks using miRVana kit (Ambion) as described (22.Miller T.E.

RNA was isolated from FFP tissue sections as described (23.Nasser M.W. Datta J. Nuovo G. Kutay H. Motiwala T. Majumder S. Wang B. Suster S. Jacob S.T. Ghoshal K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 33394-33405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). An aliquot (100 ng) of total RNA was treated with DNase I (2 units) at 37 °C for 15 min followed by heat inactivation of DNase I at 65 °C for 5 min. Ten ng of RNA was assayed using TaqMan MicroRNA kit (Applied Biosystems). miR-122 expression was normalized to 18 S rRNA or RNU6B using the 2−ΔCT method (24.Datta J. Kutay H. Nasser M.W. Nuovo G.J. Wang B. Majumder S. Liu C.G. Volinia S. Croce C.M. Schmittgen T.D. Ghoshal K. Jacob S.T. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 5049-5058Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed as described (25.Meng F. Henson R. Wehbe-Janek H. Ghoshal K. Jacob S.T. Patel T. Gastroenterology. 2007; 133: 647-658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2294) Google Scholar). ADAM10, SRF, GAPDH mRNA, and 18 S rRNA were measured in cDNA synthesized from DNase I-treated total RNA using the SYBR Green method (26.Ghoshal K. Datta J. Majumder S. Bai S. Kutay H. Motiwala T. Jacob S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 4727-4741Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). The primer sequences are provided in the supplemental materials. The miR-122 gene was amplified from mouse genomic DNA using Accuprime Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) and cloned into pBabe (SK-Hep-1), pMSCV-PIG (Hep3B), or p-RevTRE (Clontech) (HepG2) vectors (27.Lewis B.P. Shih I.H. Jones-Rhoades M.W. Bartel D.P. Burge C.B. Cell. 2003; 115: 787-798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4127) Google Scholar). The cells were infected with retroviruses generated in phoenix cells as described (28.Datta J. Majumder S. Kutay H. Motiwala T. Frankel W. Costa R. Cha H.C. MacDougald O.A. Jacob S.T. Ghoshal K. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 2736-2746Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). After 72 h the cells were selected with 2 μg/ml puromycin. The primers sequences are described in the supplemental data. The 3′-UTR and the 3′-UTR with the miR-122 site deleted of ADAM10, Igf1R, and SRF were amplified from human lymphocyte DNA and cloned into TA cloning vector (Qiagen). Inserts were retrieved with MluI and NheI and cloned into the same sites of a luciferase reporter vector, pIS0 (29.Lewis B.P. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P. Cell. 2005; 120: 15-20Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9644) Google Scholar). The correct clones were confirmed by sequencing. The primers sequences are described in the supplemental data. HCC cells or HDMEC were transiently transfected with miR-122 mimetic (Dharmacon) or miR-122 inhibitor (Dharmacon) or respective negative control RNAs using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. After 24 h the cells were trypsinized, counted, and used for monitoring growth, migration, and invasion as described (30.Kumar P. Gao Q. Ning Y. Wang Z. Krebsbach P.H. Polverini P.J. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 2060-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For miR-122 assay and Western blot analysis cells were harvested for RNA and protein, respectively, after 48 h. In situ detection of miR-122 in FFP tissue section with LNA-modified probe (Exicon) was determined as described (23.Nasser M.W. Datta J. Nuovo G. Kutay H. Motiwala T. Majumder S. Wang B. Suster S.

For co-labeling, the tissue sections were first subjected to ISH followed by immunohistochemical analysis with an anti-SRF antibody following published protocol (31.Nuovo G.J. Elton T.S. Nana-Sinkam P. Volinia S. Croce C.M. Schmittgen T.D. Nat. Protoc. 2009; 4: 107-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Cell proliferation was monitored using cell proliferation reagent kit I (MTT) (Roche Applied Science) as described before (23.Nasser M.W. Datta J. Nuovo G. Kutay H. Motiwala T. Majumder S. Wang B. Suster S. Jacob S.T. Ghoshal K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 33394-33405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). All of the experiments were performed in quadruplicate. Thymidine incorporation assay was measured as described (26.Ghoshal K. Datta J. Majumder S. Bai S. Kutay H. Motiwala T. Jacob S.T. Mol. Cell.

Cell motility assay was performed as described (23.Nasser M.W. Datta J. Nuovo G. Kutay H. Motiwala T. Majumder S. Wang B. Suster S. Jacob S.T. Ghoshal K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 33394-33405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Cell invasion assay described in the supplemental “Materials and Methods.” Matrigel in vitro endothelial tube formation assay was performed as described (30.Kumar P. Gao Q. Ning Y. Wang Z. Krebsbach P.H. Polverini P.J. Mol. Cancer Ther. 2008; 7: 2060-2069Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Ex vivo tumor growth of SK-Hep-1 cells was performed as described (34.Motiwala T.

To image tumor growth in mice first Hep3B cells expressing luciferase were generated by transfecting pCMV-Luciferase and selecting with G418. These cells were next transfected with pMSCV-miR-122 or pMSCV alone and selected with puromycin. Five million of these cells were injected into the flanks of nude mice, and tumor growth was monitored every week using IVIS imaging system (Xenogen Corporation) immediately after injecting 4.2 mg of luciferin (Gold Biotech) in 150 μl of saline. Proteins extracted from cells or tumor tissues were immunoblotted with different antibodies following published protocol (24.Datta J. Kutay H. Nasser M.W. Nuovo G.J. Wang B. Majumder S. Liu C.G. Volinia S. Croce C.M. Schmittgen T.D. Ghoshal K. Jacob S.T. Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 5049-5058Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). The catalogue number of the antibodies used is provided in the supplemental text). Protein was estimated using a Bio-Rad protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin as standard. Kodak Imaging software was used to quantify ethidium bromide-stained gels and scanned x-ray films (Western blot data). Statistical significance of differences between groups was analyzed by unpaired Student's t test, and p ≤ 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Paired Student's t test was used to analyze differences in expression of microRNAs and mRNAs levels among tumors and paired nontumor tissues in real time RT-PCR analysis. All real time RT-PCR (assayed in triplicate), Western blotting, and transfection experiments were repeated twice, and reproducible results were obtained. The correlation between miR-122 and Igf1R mRNA levels was analyzed by two-tailed Pearson correlation test. Single and double asterisks denote p ≤ 0.05 and ≤0.01, respectively. We have shown earlier by Northern blot analysis of RNA isolated from 20 frozen HCC samples that miR-122 is specifically suppressed in tumors (17.Kutay H. Bai S. Datta J. Motiwala T. Pogribny I. Frankel W. Jacob S.T. Ghoshal K. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 99: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Here, we measured miR-122 expression in FFP tissues by TaqMan real time RT-PCR (n = 16) (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). The results showed that miR-122 expression was significantly decreased in 14 HCC samples and increased in two HCC samples compared with the adjacent normal liver (Fig. 1A). The normalized miR-122 level in each sample is presented in supplemental Table S1. We also analyzed miR-122 expression in FFP sections by LNA-ISH that showed its robust expression in benign liver tissues (blue color) but barely detectable in HCCs (Fig. 1B). LNA-ISH with scrambled RNA did not give any signal (data not shown). Analysis of 18 different HCC samples by LNA-ISH showed that miR-122 was detectable only in 22% of HCCs. Notably, miR-122 was also down-regulated (31%) in cirrhotic livers. Thus, the loss of miR-122 expression in the cirrhotic liver might predispose hepatocytes to transformation. Next, we examined the anti-tumorigenic function of miR-122 in different human HCC cell lines by transfecting miR-122 mimetic or by generating stable cell lines expressing miR-122. miR-122 was detectable only in SK-Hep-1 cells transfected with miR-122 but at a level less than that in the liver (Fig. 2A). Functional studies showed miR-122 expression significantly inhibited growth of these cells, which increased with time (Fig. 2B) and correlated with a 48% reduction in their replication potential (Fig. 2C). Similarly, the ability of single cells to form colonies in soft agar was reduced by 22% upon ectopic expression of miR-122 (Fig. 2D and supplemental Fig. S1). miR-122 expression also impeded migration of SK-Hep-1 cells to serum-containing medium placed at the bottom chamber of a trans-well plate (Fig. 2E). miR-122 also compromised the ability of SK-Hep-1 cells to produce tumors in nude mice (Fig. 2F), another hallmark of cancer cells. Tumor growth decreased by 64, 64, 50, and 40%, respectively, in mice 1–4 compared with the controls. These results demonstrated tumor suppressor properties of miR-122 in SK-Hep-1 cells. A significant drop in miR-122 level in the tumors compared with that in SK-Hep-1 cells before transplantation to the nude mice probably explains the modest inhibition of tumor growth by this microRNA (Fig. 2G). To confirm that the anti-tumorigenic property of miR-122 is not restricted to SK-Hep-1 cells, we tested its functions in two other HCC cell lines. Hep3B cells that do not express detectable miR-122 were transfected with a retroviral vector stably expressing miR-122 (supplemental Fig. S2A). There was a small but significant decrease in the growth of miR-122-expressing cells for 5 days in culture (Fig. 3A) that correlated with an increase in population of cells at the G1 phase (64 and 74% in control and miR-122-expressing cells, respectively) and a decrease in that at the S phase (30 and 18% in control and miR-122-expressing cells, respectively) (Fig. 3B). Similarly, clonogenic survival of Hep3B cells was also significantly compromised (∼50%) in miR-122-expressing cells (supplemental Fig. S2B). Next we tested the ability of miR-122 to impede Hep3B cell growth in nude mice using bioluminescence imaging (Fig. 3C). For this purpose stable cell lines co-expressing firefly luciferase and miR-122 and the empty vector were injected into the right and left flanks, respectively, of nude mice that were imaged every week. A representative photograph of the images of tumors developed in nude mice is shown in Fig. 3C (panel i). Quantification of the luciferase signal showed a reduction in the ability of miR-122-expressing cells to form tumors in all four mice, albeit at different levels (81, 25, 82, and 55% in mice 1–4, respectively) compared with that of controls (Fig. 3C, panel ii). Expression of miR-122 in another nonexpressing HCC cell line, HepG2, also resulted in a small but significant reduction in growth in culture and invasion through basement membrane (supplemental Fig. S3). To study the effect of miR-122 on morphology of these cells, we generated stable cell line expressing miR-122 (Fig. 3D). It is notable that the morphology of miR-122-expressing HepG2 cells was distinct from those transfected with the vector. After 3 days in culture both cell types showed epithelial morphology, but cell-cell contact was very prominent in miR-122-expressing cells (Fig. 3E). After 14 days in culture, epithelial morphology was lost in the control cells probably because of overgrowth and transition to mesenchymal phenotype, as evident from the expression of Vimentin, a marker for mesenchymal cells (Fig. 3F). In contrast, miR-122-expressing cells retained epithelial morphology even after 14 days in culture (Fig. 3E) that correlated with significant decrease (50%) in Vimentin expression in these cells (Fig. 3F), implicating the involvement of miR-122 in maintaining epithelial phenotype of HepG2 cells. Next we investigated whether depletion of miR-122 from Huh-7 cells that express miR-122, albeit at a lower level than the liver (supplemental Fig. S4A), could enhance their tumorigenic properties. Transfection of anti-miR-122 (50 nm) resulted in a ∼50% decrease in its expression (supplemental Fig. S4A) that correlated with facilitated growth (supplemental Fig. S4B), replication potential (supplemental Fig. S4C), migration (supplemental Fig. S4D), and clonogenic survival (supplemental Fig. S4E) of these cells compared with those transfected with control RNA. Taken together, these results demonstrated anti-tumorigenic characteristics of miR-122 in HCC cells. Next, we sought to identify the target mRNAs of miR-122 that might play a role in tumorigenesis. A data base search revealed several growth regulatory mRNAs that harbor conserved miR-122 recognition sites in their 3′-UTR. We focused our attention on ADAM10 (Fig. 4A, panel i) because ADAM family proteins are involved in various biological processes such as cell adhesion, cell fusion, cell migration and invasion, membrane protein shedding, and proteolysis (35.Duffy M.J. McKiernan E. O'Donovan N. McGowan P.M. Clin. Cancer Res. 2009; 15: 1140-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 36.Maretzky T. Reiss K. Ludwig A. Buchholz J. Scholz F. Proksch E. de Strooper B. Hartmann D. Saftig P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 9182-9187Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that miR-122 directly regulates ADAM10 expression by interacting with its 3′-UTR, we co-transfected pIS0 harboring the 3′-UTR of ADAM10 downstream of firefly luciferase reporter along with miR-122 or control RNA. A small but significant decrease (20%, p = 0.04) in luciferase activity was observed specifically in pIS0-ADAM10 following expression of miR-122, which was abrogated when the miR-122 site was deleted from ADAM10–3′-UTR (Fig. 4A, panel ii). These results suggest that miR-122 negatively regulates ADAM10 expression by interacting with its 3′-UTR. To confirm that miR-122 regulates endogenous ADAM10 protein expression in HCC cells, we measured its level in SK-Hep-1 and Hep3B cells expressing ectopic miR-122 or in Huh-7 cells depleted of endogenous miR-122. The results showed that ADAM10 level was reduced in SK-Hep-1 and Hep3B cells by 50 and 80%, respectively, upon ectopic expression of miR-122 (Fig. 4B). In contrast, its expression increased by 40 and 100%, respectively, in Huh-7 cells transfected with 50 and 100 nm anti-miR-122 (Fig. 4B). The relative miR-122 levels in each cell type are shown in the respective lower panels of Fig. 4B. These data also revealed that the effect of miR-122 on ADAM10 protein was more pronounced than on the heterologous luciferase protein. Notably, the RNA level of ADAM10 and ADAM17, another validated target of miR-122 (20.Tsai W.C. Hsu P.W. Lai T.C. Chau G.Y. Lin C.W. Chen C.M. Lin C.D. Liao Y.L. Wang J.L. Chau Y.P. Hsu M.T. Hsiao M.

Analysis of ADAM10 RNA level in primary human HCCs showed significant increase (p = 0.02) in tumors compared with matching liver tissues (Fig. 4C). In contrast, miR-122 was down-regulated in th"

Whether the orphan G-protein coupled receptor GPR55 is also a cannabinoid receptor remains unclear as a result of conflicting pharmacological studies. GPR55 has been reported to be activated by exogenous and endogenous cannabinoid compounds but surprisingly also by the endogenous non-cannabinoid mediator lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI). We examined the effects of a representative panel of cannabinoid ligands and LPI on GPR55 using a β-arrestin-green fluorescent protein biosensor as a direct readout of agonist-mediated receptor activation. Our data demonstrate that AM251 and SR141716A (rimonabant), which are cannabinoid antagonists, and the lipid LPI, which is not a cannabinoid receptor ligand, are GPR55 agonists. They possess comparable efficacy in inducing β-arrestin trafficking and, moreover, activate the G-protein-dependent signaling of protein kinase CβII. Conversely, the potent synthetic cannabinoid agonist CP55,940 acts as a GPR55 antagonist/partial agonist. CP55,940 blocks GPR55 internalization, the formation of β-arrestin GPR55 complexes, and the phosphorylation of ERK1/2; CP55,940 produces only a slight amount of protein kinase CβII membrane recruitment but does not stimulate membrane remodeling like LPI, AM251, or rimonabant. Our studies provide a paradigm for measuring the responsiveness of GPR55 to a variety of ligand scaffolds comprising cannabinoid and novel compounds and suggest that at best GPR55 is an atypical cannabinoid responder. The activation of GPR55 by rimonabant may be responsible for some of the off-target effects that led to its removal as a potential obesity therapy.

More recently CB1 receptors along with other GPCRs have been promoted as therapeutic pharmacological targets in the billion dollar weight loss market for controversial drugs such as rimonabant (SR141716A) and Fen-phen. Thus, an important utility of cannabinoid family receptors to society appears to arise from their role in regulating a broad spectrum of addiction-based behaviors, and the addition of new members to the cannabinoid receptor family may have social and economic implications that reach far beyond the initial scientific discovery. As a consequence, the re-classification of an orphan GPCR as a cannabinoid family member should be done with caution requiring strict criteria of receptor activation by THC derivatives or endogenous cannabinoid compounds and a widespread agreement of the results by the scientific community. cannabinoid receptor 1 G-protein-coupled receptor lysophosphatidylinositol (-)-3-[2-hydroxyl-4-(1,1-dimethylheptyl)phenyl]-4-[3-hydroxyl propyl] cyclohexan-1-ol (−)-11-hydroxyl-Δ8-tetrahydrocannabinol-dimethylheptyl N-(piperidin-1-yl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (R)-(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[(4-morpholinyl)methyl]pyrrolo[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl](1-naphthalenyl)methanone (2-methyl-1-propyl-1H-3yl)-1-naphthalenyl-methanone 2-arachidonoyl glycerol 1-(2,4-dicholorophenyl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-4-methyl-N-1-piperidinyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide 1-(2,4-dicholorophenyl)-5-(4-iodophenyl)-4-morphoniyl-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide 5-methyl-4-[(1R,6R)-3-methyl-6-(1-methylenyl)-2-cyclohexen-1-yl]-1,3-benzenediol 1,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-2-[(1R,6R)-3-methyl-6-(1-methylethenyl)-2-cyclohexen-1-yl]-benzene 2-[1R-3-methyl-6R-(1-methylethenyl)-2-cyclohexen-1-yl]-5-pentyl-1,3-benzenediol abnormal cannabidiol, 4-[3-methyl-6R-(1-methylethenyl)-2-cyclohexen-1-yl]-5-pentyl-1,3-benzenediol mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular-regulated protein kinase protein kinase C tetrahydrocannabinol lysophosphatidylinositol green fluorescent protein 2β-arrestin2 hemagglutinin.

The CB1 and CB2 receptors are 44% identical and signal through Gi/o-mediated pathways. Activation of either receptor is inhibitory for cAMP production via adenylyl cyclase and stimulatory for mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (extracellular-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)) activation (5Felder C.C.

However, the failure of these two receptors to account for the full complement of physiological effects observed with cannabinoid ligands has led to the hypothesis that additional cannabinoid-like receptors exist. The orphan GPCR, GPR55, which exhibits only 10–15% homology to the two human cannabinoid receptors (6Ross R.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2009; 30: 156-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar), is one of a number of plausible cannabinoid family member candidates (7Baker D. Pryce G. Davies W.L. Hiley C.R. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2006; 27: 1-4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). GPR55 was first identified and mapped to human chromosome 2q37 a decade ago (8Sawzdargo M. Nguyen T. Lee D.K. Lynch K.R. Cheng R. Heng H.H. George S.R. O'Dowd B.F. Brain Res. Mol.

Observations using a GTPγS functional assay indicate that GPR55 is activated by nanomolar concentrations of the endocannabinoids 2-AG, virodhamine, noladin ether, and palmitoylethanolamine (10Ryberg E. Larsson N. Sjögren S. Hjorth S. Hermansson N.O. Leonova J. Elebring T. Nilsson K. Drmota T. Greasley P.J. Br. J.

Exposure of GPR55 to the cannabinoids THC and JWH015 in dorsal root ganglion neurons and in receptor-transfected HEK293 cells correlates with increases of intracellular Ca2+ (11Lauckner J.E.

In contrast, GPR55 is insensitive to the CB1 inverse agonist AM281 and the potent cannabinoid agonist WIN55212-2 but is antagonized by the marijuana constituent CBD (9Henstridge C.M. Balenga N.A.

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 362: 928-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) reported that GPR55 is not a typical cannabinoid receptor, as numerous endogenous and synthetic cannabinoids, including many mentioned above, had no effect on GPR55 activity. They present compelling data suggesting that the endogenous lipid LPI and its 2-arachidonyl analogs are agonists at GPR55 as a result of their abilities to phosphorylate extracellular-regulated kinase and induce calcium signaling (13Oka S. Nakajima K. Yamashita A. Kishimoto S. Sugiura T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 362: 928-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar, 14Oka S. Toshida T. Maruyama K. Nakajima K. Yamashita A. Sugiura T. J. Biochem. 2009; 145: 13-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Further studies indicate that LPI and the rimonabant-like CB1 inverse agonist AM251 induce oscillatory Ca2+ release through Gα13 and RhoA (9Henstridge C.M. Balenga N.A. Ford L.A. Ross R.A. Waldhoer M. Irving A.J. FASEB J. 2009; 23: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). These reports were all performed in HEK 293 cells, yet each documented a distinct and conflicting chemical space of agonists that recognized GPR55. To resolve these inconsistencies in classification, an alternative approach for identifying GPR55 ligands that is insensitive to the endogenous complement of cellular receptors could circumvent many of the challenges that have arisen in the measurements of G-protein signaling. β-Arrestins are intracellular proteins that bind and desensitize activated GPCRs and in the process form stable receptor/arrestin signaling complexes (15Gurevich E.V. Gurevich V.V. Genome Biology. 2006; 7: 236Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 16Shenoy S.K. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Cell Biol. 2005; 7: 1159-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). β-Arrestin redistribution to the activated membrane-bound receptor represents one of the early intracellular events provoked by agonist binding and, consequently, is less prone to a false positive or negative readout as compared with studying a downstream signaling event as a readout of receptor activation. β-arrestin-green fluorescent chimeras can make this process attractive to monitor by forming remarkably sensitive and specific probes of GPCR activation that are independent of downstream G-protein-mediated signaling (17Barak L.S.

We have determined GPR55 responsiveness to a representative panel of cannabinoid ligands and LPI in the presence (and absence) of a β-arrestin2-green fluorescent protein (βarr2-GFP) biosensor. Our data demonstrate that LPI, the CB1 inverse agonist/antagonists SR141716A, and AM251 are GPR55 agonists, and the CB1 agonist CP55940 is a GPR55 antagonist/partial agonist. These data together with our inability to observe activation of GPR55 by Δ9-THC and endocannabinoids indicate that GPR55 should be classified as an atypical cannabinoid receptor at best.

Human GPR55 in the vector pCMV-sport6 (NIH Image Consortium) were transiently transfected in HEK293 cells with (5:1 ratio) and without βarr2-GFP or PKCβII-GFP plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 as specified by the manufacturer or coprecipitation with calcium phosphate as previously described (17Barak L.S.

The human N-terminal HA-tagged GPR55E receptor in pCDNA3.1zeo(−) was constructed from GPR55 by inserting the HA sequence YPYDVPDYA after the start Met of the receptor and modifying its C terminus by replacing the terminal GPR55 amino acid sequence HRPSRVQLVLQDTTISRG by the four-amino acid linker CAAA containing a putative cysteine palmitoylation site followed by the human vasopressin2 receptor terminal tail sequence RGRTPPSLGPQDESCTTASSSLAKDTSS (21Oakley R.H.

A U2OS cell line stably expressing GPR55E and βarr2-GFP (Renilla) was engineered using 0.4 mg/ml zeocin and 0.4 mg/ml G418 selection and maintained in 100 μg/ml G418 and 50 μg/ml zeocin in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator.

The CB1-RE cell line was constructed as above. HEK 293 cells transiently expressing GPR55 receptors and βarr2-GFP were utilized 48 h after transfection. U2OS cells permanently expressing HA-GPR55E and βarr2-GFP were plated onto coverslips that were placed in 24-well plates which had been pretreated for 1 h with 0.02 mg/ml poly-d-lysine. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 until ready for experiments (80–85% confluent) and washed once with Hanks' balanced salt solution before drug application. Agonist-stimulated redistribution of βarr2-GFP was assessed after drug treatment for 40 min. To measure the effects of antagonists, both agonist and antagonist were co-applied. Cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature followed by three washes with Hanks' balanced salt solution. Glass coverslips were mounted on slides in SlowFade Gold mounting media and were imaged on a (Nikon E800) fluorescence microscope using a 40× oil objective and 488-nm excitation for GFP and 568-nm excitation for Alexa Fluor 568 antibody. Confocal images were acquired with Leica TCS SP5 and Zeiss LSM-510 microscopes. GPR55-expressing cells grown on coverslips were incubated over ice for 40 min with a 1:500 dilution of mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody in blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline). This was followed by appropriate washes and a 40-min incubation with 1:1500 dilution of Alexa Fluor 568 goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. Antibody-labeled cells were treated with agonist alone or in combination with antagonist for 40 min at 37 °C. Cells were imaged as described above. GPR55E-expressing cells were grown until 90% confluent in poly-d-lysine-treated 96-well glass-bottom plates (BD Falcon). Cells were incubated with a mouse monoclonal anti-HA antibody at a 1:100 dilution for 45-min at 37 °C. Cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline before drug treatment, fixed in paraformaldehyde as described, and washed 3 times with phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min each. Cells were then treated with LI-COR Odyssey blocking buffer for 45 min at room temperature and then incubated in the dark with the secondary IRDye 800-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody diluted 1:1000 in LI-COR blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were then washed 5 times in TBST (137 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris with 0.05% Tween 20) and scanned on the LI-COR Odyssey Infrared Imager set at 169 μm resolution, 4 focus offset, and 4.5–6 intensity. Data were analyzed using Excel and Prism 4.0 software. GPR55E-expressing U2OS cells were grown to sub-confluence in 60-mm plates and serum-starved overnight before assay. After drug treatment the cells were disrupted in a lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μm MgCl2, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 25 mm NaF, and a protease inhibitor mixture (1:25, pH 7.5). Lysates were immediately placed on ice for 10 min and then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. Supernatants, corresponding to the cytosolic fraction, were collected, and protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Cytosolic fractions (20 μg) were separated on a 10% gel by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting (22Gallagher S. Winston S.E. Fuller S.A. Hurrell J.G. Curr. Protoc. Immunol. 2008; (Chapter 8, Unit 8.10)Google Scholar). Antibodies against double-phosphorylated ERK1/2 (1:5000) were detected using a Fuji imager LAS-1000 (Fujifilm Life Science, Woodbridge, CT). A monoclonal antibody against actin (1:10,000) was used to confirm equal protein loading. Densitometric analysis was performed using ImageJ software (rsb.nih.gov/ij). The value obtained for both ERK1 and ERK2 was normalized to anti-actin levels. The data were normalized to control and presented as percentage stimulation. HEK 293 cells plated in 35-mm glass well Matek plastic dishes were transiently transfected with 175 μl of solution containing 1.5 μg/ml PKCβII-GFP cDNA or the PKC plasmid and 5 μg/ml human GPR55 cDNA in pCMV-Sport6 (Open Biosystems, Huntsville, Al) using a standard calcium phosphate protocol. Cells expressing GPR55 and PKCβII-GFP were utilized 24 h after transfection. Cells were washed with warm minimum Eagle's medium and maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 30–45 min after drug application. Agonist stimulated redistribution of PKCβII-GFP was assessed after drug treatment at room temperature. βarr2-GFP aggregates were identified using a wavelet-based Microsoft Windows compatible computer program written in the MatLab programming environment. A program algorithm extracts from two-dimensional images those pixels that generate objects of interest that fall within a predetermined range of sizes and intensities and that are embedded among widely varying local backgrounds (L. Barak, available from the Duke University GPCR Assay Bank). Concentration-effect curves for agonist-mediated receptor activation and competition-inhibition curves for antagonist studies were analyzed by nonlinear regression techniques using GraphPad Prism 4.0 software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA), and data were fitted to sigmoidal dose-response curves to obtain EC50 or IC50 values. The KI (apparent) value of the antagonist was calculated using the Cheng-Prusoff equation, KI = IC50/(1 + [L]/EC50) (23Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12294) Google Scholar), where [L] is the agonist concentration. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett's post-test or two-tailed unpaired Student's t test. p values of <0.05 were considered significant. Arrestin proteins mediate GPCR desensitization by binding to activated GPCRs, and in the process the arrestins relocate from the cytosol to form a complex with the membrane receptor. The strength of this association determines the subsequent fate of the complex, with weaker β-arrestin-receptor complexes dissociating at the plasma membrane while in clathrin-coated pits and more stable ones internalizing and concentrating in cytosolic endosomes (18Marion S.

In the absence of agonist, β-arrestin-GFP is uniformly distributed in the cytoplasm with no apparent compartmentalization at the plasma membrane or nucleus (Fig. 1, A and D). Using β-arrestin-GFP as a biosensor of receptor activation, the relatively weak β-arrestin-receptor complexes are observed as membrane-associated fluorescence aggregates and the more stable ones as brighter intracellular objects. HEK293 cells transiently transfected with human GPR55 and βarr2-GFP develop membrane aggregates when treated with 10 μm LPI (Fig. 1, A and B). The addition of serine phosphorylation sites to a GPCR C-tail can increase receptor affinity for arrestin without changing its response profile to different ligands (21Oakley R.H. Laporte S.A.

Methods Enzymol. 2006; 414: 121-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Therefore, to increase GPR55 assay sensitivity, we employed an HA-epitope-tagged variant of GPR55 with a serine enhanced C terminus (HA-GPR55E). This resulted in a much more robust βarr2-GFP response in HEK-293 cells when HA-GPR55E was exposed to 10 μm LPI (Fig. 1C). A time-course analysis of ligand treatment demonstrated robust agonist-mediated βarr2-GFP trafficking at 40-min ligand treatment (data not shown). Consequently, we used U2OS cells stably transfected with HA-GPR55E and βarr2-GFP for subsequent ligand characterization. Fig. 1D shows the pattern of βarr2-GFP expression in U2OS cells in the absence of agonist. No βarr2-GFP fluorescence was observed at the plasma membrane. Immunofluorescence images of anti-HA antibody labeling followed by Alexa Fluor secondary antibody verify the plasma membrane expression of HA-tagged GPR55E (Fig. 1E), with no membrane fluorescence visible in the absence of primary HA-antibody treatment (Fig. 1G). Using real-time confocal microscopy in live U2OS cells stably coexpressed with GPR55E and βarr2-GFP, we observed that 3 μm LPI induced a rapid relocation (60–90s time scale) of βarr2-GFP complex en masse to plasma membrane-bound GPR55E with a concomitant depletion of cytosolic fluorescence (see the supplemental videos). We next investigated the concentration dependence of ligands to induce internalization of GPR55·βarr2-GFP complexes. This LPI mediated-response of βarr2-GFP occurs with an EC50 of 1.2 μm (Figs. 2, A and B), whereas the CB1 receptor inverse agonist/antagonists SR141716A and AM251 produce recruitment of βarr2-GFP to GPR55E receptors with EC50 values of 3.9 and 9.6 μm, respectively (Fig. 2, C–F). Thus, these ligands act as GPR55E agonists and have efficacies similar to LPI (Fig. 2H). We also treated the GPR55E/βarr-GFP U2OS cells with a group of 15 structurally diverse cannabinoid ligands comprised of classic, non-classic, and endogenous agonists and antagonists (Table 1). None of the compounds at concentrations upward of 10–30 μm activated GPR55E to produce a distribution of βarr2-GFP different from the basal state or that observed in vehicle-treated cells. As a control, U2OS cells expressing CB1 receptors were exposed to vehicle, LPI, and SR141716A, and no βarr2-GFP trafficking was observed (Fig. 3, A–C), whereas CP55,940, a potent CB1 receptor agonist, activated βarr2-GFP trafficking in these cells (Fig. 3D).TABLE 1β-Arrestin-dependent ligand-mediated activation of GPR55ELigandGPR55 EC50 (95% CI)Relative efficacy ± S.E.CB1 (KI)aPreviously published. or EC50LPI1.2 μm (0.3–4.0), agonist1.0 ± 0.13No response up to 30 μmSR141716A3.9 μm (0.9–17), agonist0.85 ± 0.15(3.3 nm)aPreviously published.

First, a membrane-proximal cleavage is executed by a metalloprotease, removing the extracellular domain. This allows γ-secretase to execute a second cleavage within the Notch transmembrane domain, which releases the intracellular domain to enter the nucleus. Here we show that the ADAM10 metalloprotease Kuzbanian, but not ADAM17/tumor necrosis factor α-converting enzyme, plays an essential role in executing ligand-induced extracellular cleavage at site 2 (S2) in cells and localizes this step to the plasma membrane. Importantly, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of metalloproteases still allowed extracellular cleavage of Notch, indicating the presence of unknown proteases with the ability to cleave at S2. Gain of function mutations identified in human cancers and in model organisms that map to the negative control region alleviate the requirement for ligand binding for extracellular cleavage to occur. Because cancer-causing Notch1 mutations also depend on (rate-limiting) S2 proteolysis, the identity of these alternative proteases has important implications for understanding Notch activation in normal and cancer cells.

The Notch signaling pathway plays multiple essential functions during metazoan development and in adult tissues where it controls homeostatic self-renewal, differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis (1Wilson A.

S1-cleaved Notch proteins accumulate at the plasma membrane as heterodimeric polypeptides composed of the Notch extracellular domain (NECD) and a transmembrane and intracellular domain held together by the heterodimerization domain (HD). In the absence of ligand, a negative regulatory region (NRR) composed of the globular HD domain and the overlaying Lin12/Notch repeats (LNR) prevents access of proteases and thus prevents activation of Notch (2Sanchez-Irizarry C.

First, Notch proteins lacking NECD are constitutively cleaved by γ-secretase (5Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Saxena M.T. Griesemer A. Tian X. Pan D.J. Ray W.J. Kopan R. Mol.

Fourth, missense mutations in the HD domain destabilize the NRR and occur at high frequency in human T-cell acute lymphocytic leukemia (T-ALL) (18Weng A.P. Ferrando A.A. Lee W. Morris 4th, J.P.

It has been well established that HD domain mutations cause ligand-independent S2 cleavage (5Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Saxena M.T. Griesemer A. Tian X. Pan D.J. Ray W.J. Kopan R. Mol.

ADAMs or disintegrin and metalloproteases are membrane-bound zinc-dependent enzymes of the metzincin clan that have diverse roles in adhesion and proteolytic cleavage of numerous cell surface signaling molecules in normal homeostasis and disease (20Reiss K.

In vitro, TACE cleaves Notch1 just outside the transmembrane region between residues Ala1710 and Val1711 (19Brou C. Logeat F. Gupta N. Bessia C. LeBail O. Doedens J.R. Cumano A. Roux P. Black R.A.

However, Tace-deficient mice or flies do not phenocopy the Notch1 phenotype suggesting that TACE is either redundant with another protease or is a tissue-specific Notch1 S2-protease in vivo (21Peschon J.J.

In contrast, mice lacking Adam10 die at day 9.5 of embryogenesis with reduced neuronal Hes5 expression resembling Notch1-null embryos (24Hartmann D. de Strooper B. Serneels L. Craessaerts K. Herreman A. Annaert W. Umans L. Lübke T. Lena Illert A. von Figura K. Saftig P. Hum. Mol.

Han M. Xu T. Zhuang Y. Int. Immunol. 2008; 20: 1181-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). However, mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking Adam10 have no apparent defect in ligand-independent Notch1 processing (5Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Saxena M.T. Griesemer A. Tian X. Pan D.J. Ray W.J. Kopan R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 197-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 24Hartmann D. de Strooper B. Serneels L. Craessaerts K. Herreman A. Annaert W. Umans L. Lübke T. Lena Illert A. von Figura K. Saftig P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 2615-2624Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to this ambiguity in vertebrates, in flies the ADAM10 homolog Kuzbanian (Kuz) binds dNotch directly and is the major enzyme involved in Notch cleavage and signaling (22Lieber T. Kidd S. Young M.W. Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 209-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 23Sotillos S. Roch F. Campuzano S. Development. 1997; 124: 4769-4779PubMed Google Scholar). Understanding the precise role of ADAM10 in Notch signaling has been further complicated by the fact that Kuz has also been reported to cleave Notch ligands in flies (26Qi H. Rand M.D. Wu X. Sestan N. Wang W. Rakic P. Xu T. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Science. 1999; 283: 91-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) and mammalian cells (27LaVoie M.J. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34427-34437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 28Six E. Ndiaye D. Laabi Y. Brou C. Gupta-Rossi N. Israel A. Logeat F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cell Biol. 2002; 159: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Whereas in flies this task is shared with an ADAM10/Kuz homolog (Kuz-like or Kul) that is dedicated to cleavage of the Notch ligand Delta (30Sapir A. Assa-Kunik E. Tsruya R. Schejter E. Shilo B.Z. Development. 2005; 132: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), no Kul homolog has been identified in mammals thus far. Therefore, the phenotypes attributed to ADAM10 loss in mammals could reflect compound phenotypes due to defects in the cleavage of Notch, Delta, or both. Because the identity of enzyme(s) cleaving Notch1 at S2 remains controversial, we characterized Notch1 cleavage in ligand-dependent and -independent signaling and mapped the amino acids required for cleavage. We find that ADAM10, but not ADAM17/TACE, is essential for catalyzing ligand-induced S2 cleavage. This step occurs at the plasma membrane, suggestive of a similar localization for the subsequent cleavage by γ-secretase. Importantly, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of metalloproteases still permits S2 cleavage, indicating that multiple proteases have the ability to cleave Notch1. Our findings provide further insight into the mechanism of Notch1 activation in normal and cancer cells. Elucidating the proteolytic machinery leading to Notch1 activation is important because inhibition of this rate-limiting step using targeted drugs may offer novel treatment options in Notch1-related diseases. All mNotch1 plasmids were initially cloned into pCS2+6Myc as described (16Kopan R. Schroeter E.H. Weintraub H. Nye J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Notch1 Δice (supplemental Fig. 1B) is made by deleting part of the NICD and inserting a 6Myc tag after Gly1755 (31Vooijs M. Schroeter E.H. Pan Y. Blandford M. Kopan R. J. Biol.

Notch1 GV16 fusion proteins are made by inserting a Gal4VP16 lacking an internal ATG via a unique SgrAI site after the transmembrane domain. Notch1 mCherry fusions were made by PCR-directed cloning and removal of the 6Myc for replacement with the mCherry gene. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). All mutant constructs were sequence-verified. A construct containing 4xCSL synthetic binding sites in tandem (PJA23) was used for Notch transcription assays (kindly provided by D. Hayward). For Notch1 GV16 cleavage assays, an FR-Luc construct containing 5xGal4 DNA-binding sites (Stratagene) was used. For normalization of the luciferase assays, a cytomegalovirus-driven Renilla luciferase (Promega) was used. The LZRS Jagged1 construct was a gift from B. Blom. A plasmid expressing stable HIF1α was described earlier (32Groot A.J. Gort E.H. van der Wall E. van Diest P.J. Vooijs M. Cell Oncol. 2008; 30: 397-409PubMed Google Scholar). The Notch1 Val1711 antibody was generated by immunizing chickens with the peptide VKSEPVE. Total IgY was isolated from yolks using the IgY purification kit (Pierce), and the antibody was affinity-purified using the SulfoLink immobilization kit for peptides (Thermo Scientific). Eluted antibody was dialyzed in PBS.

NIH-3T3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% normal calf serum. Co-cultures were in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transfections of HEK293, HeLa, and U2OS were performed using polyethyleneimine (Polysciences Inc.). NIH-3T3 were transfected by calcium phosphate using BBS buffer. Cells were lysed in RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 50 mm Tris pH 8.0) for 20 min at 4 °C. Lysates were spun down for 15 min at 14,000 rpm at 4 °C. Supernatant was added to 2× Laemmli buffer. Samples were boiled for 5 min and loaded onto SDS-PAGE. Cells were lysed in CoIP buffer (200 mm KCl, 25 mm Hepes pH 7.4, 20 mm NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.2 mm EGTA, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)) for 20 min at 4 °C. DNA was sheared using a syringe and centrifuged for 15 min at 4 °C. Input samples were taken, and 2 μg of Notch1 C-20 antibody was added for 6 h at 4 °C to precipitate endogenous Notch1. Protein A-Sepharose 4B beads (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) were added overnight to retrieve antibody-bound protein. Samples were washed three times in lysis buffer, 3× PBS, and were taken in 2× Laemmli buffer with 50 mm dithiothreitol.

Cells were washed twice in 1× Hanks' balanced salt solution buffer (Invitrogen) and incubated in 1× Hanks' balanced salt solution buffer containing 5 mm EDTA for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence or absence of GSI. Buffer was replaced with medium and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C. Cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min and incubated in 20 mm ammonium chloride for 10 min. Cells were blocked in NET-gel buffer (50 mm Tris pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% gelatin), and Val1711 and Val1744 antibodies were incubated at 1:100 dilution in NET-gel buffer.

Samples were washed three times in RIPA and three times in PBS, boiled in Laemmli buffer, and analyzed by PAGE. Using constitutively active Notch1 proteins, the S2 cleavage site was identified previously in cultured cells (5Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Saxena M.T. Griesemer A. Tian X. Pan D.J. Ray W.J. Kopan R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 197-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar) and in vitro (19Brou C. Logeat F. Gupta N. Bessia C. LeBail O. Doedens J.R. Cumano A. Roux P.

To determine whether during Notch1 signaling NECD cleavage occurred at this position, we generated a peptide-specific antibody (αVal1711) against the seven NH2-terminal residues (NH2-VKSEPVE) exposed after cleavage of mouse Notch1 in cell-free assays. The Val1711 antibody was first validated in HEK293 cells transiently transfected with a ligand-independent mouse Notch1 construct lacking the epidermal growth factor repeats and containing the HD gain of function mutation L1594P found in T-ALL (LNR; supplemental Fig. S1A) (18Weng A.P. Ferrando A.A. Lee W. Morris 4th, J.P. Silverman L.B. Sanchez-Irizarry C. Blacklow S.C. Look A.T. Aster J.C. Science. 2004; 306: 269-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (2186) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting of transfected cell lysates using the S3 cleavage-specific antibody Val1744 indicated that L1594P mutation-containing proteins were cleaved by γ-secretase, whereas wild type LNR proteins were not. RBP-Jk/CSL-luciferase reporter assays confirmed that inserting the L1594P mutation resulted in ligand-independent activation (Fig. 1, B and C). Val1744 cleavage can be blocked by the γ-secretase inhibitors (GSI) dibenzazepine and DAPT, leading to loss of luciferase activity in cells expressing L1594P. SDS-PAGE analysis of lysates from GSI-treated cells followed by anti-Myc immunoblotting revealed accumulation of a fragment with lower mobility migrating just below the transmembrane and intracellular domain fragment, consistent with NEXT (the S2 cleavage product; Fig. 1B) (5Mumm J.S. Schroeter E.H. Saxena M.T. Griesemer A. Tian X. Pan D.J. Ray W.J. Kopan R. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 197-206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). Probing these blots for Val1711 confirmed that cells expressing mutant (active) but not wild type (inactive) Notch1 LNR proteins contained the epitope detectable by αVal1711. Inclusion of the immunization peptide completely blocked Val1711 detection, whereas a control Notch2-derived peptide had no effect, establishing specificity. Importantly, this fragment was identified only when cells were cultured in the presence of GSIs, confirming the following: 1) that proteolysis at Val1711 precedes γ-secretase cleavage at Val1744, and 2) demonstrates a very short half-life for the S2-cleaved NEXT fragment suggesting S2 and S3 may occur in the same cellular compartment (5Mumm J.S.

It is possible that mutant Notch1 molecules are cleaved at a different scissile bond than ligand-activated receptors. We therefore investigated whether ligand-dependent Notch1 signaling produced the Val1711 epitope by co-culturing HeLaN1 cells, stably expressing mNotch1 (35Jarriault S. Le Bail O. Hirsinger E. Pourquié O. Logeat F. Strong C.F. Brou C. Seidah N.G. Israel A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7423-7431Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), with the OP9 bone marrow stromal cell line stably expressing Jagged1 or Delta1 (33Dontje W. Schotte R. Cupedo T. Nagasawa M. Scheeren F. Gimeno R. Spits H. Blom B. Blood. 2006; 107: 2446-2452Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Ligand stimulation of HeLaN1 leads to S3 cleavage of Notch1, readily detected with αVal1744 (Fig. 2A). GSI treatment blocked ligand-induced transcriptional reporter activation and resulted in the accumulation of αVal1711-detectable S2 fragments in both Jagged1 and Dll1 stimulated cells with similar efficiency. Thus, ligand-induced Notch1 signaling leads to NECD cleavage at Val1711. During the course of these experiments, we found that OP9 cells express low levels of Notch1 that could be efficiently immunoprecipitated with Notch1 antibodies (Fig. 2B). We reasoned that OP9 ligand-expressing cells may therefore undergo endogenous ligand-dependent Notch1 signaling (36Luty W.H. Rodeberg D. Parness J. Vyas Y.M. J. Immunol. 2007; 179: 819-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Extracts from confluent OP9-Jagged1 cells contain Notch1 receptors cleaved at Val1744 (Fig. 2B). OP9-control cells expressed Notch1 that was not cleaved in the absence of ligand. Furthermore, upon GSI treatment, in both OP9-Jag1 and OP9-Dll1, but not in control OP9 cells, endogenous Notch1 receptors were cleaved at Val1711 (Fig. 2B). Thus, ligand stimulation of endogenous Notch1 also proceeds through consecutive cleavage at Val1711 and Val1744 in mammalian cells. Next, we investigated if cleavage at Val1711 occurred in constitutively active Notch1 proteins harboring other HD mutations found in human T-ALL patients (17Malecki M.J. Sanchez-Irizarry C.

These mutations were introduced into the inactive mouse N1LNR-6Myc expression construct and transfected in HEK293 cells (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. 2). All LNR mutant proteins were expressed at comparable levels, and all were furin-cleaved (albeit to a different extent) as shown by anti-Myc immunoblots from cell lysates (17Malecki M.J.

We used the marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus as a model system for addressing important challenges facing high-throughput whole genome amplification (WGA) and complete genome sequencing of individual cells.We describe a pipeline that enables single-cell WGA on hundreds of cells at a time while virtually eliminating non-target DNA from the reactions. We further developed a post-amplification normalization procedure that mitigates extreme variations in sequencing coverage associated with multiple displacement amplification (MDA), and demonstrated that the procedure increased sequencing efficiency and facilitated genome assembly. We report genome recovery as high as 99.6% with reference-guided assembly, and 95% with de novo assembly starting from a single cell. We also analyzed the impact of chimera formation during MDA on de novo assembly, and discuss strategies to minimize the presence of incorrectly joined regions in contigs.The methods describe in this paper will be useful for sequencing genomes of individual cells from a variety of samples."
https://openalex.org/W1970504457,"Emerging results suggest that ceramides with different fatty acid chain lengths might play distinct functions in the regulation of tumor growth and therapy. Here we report that de novo-generated C(18)- and C(16)-ceramides by ceramide synthases 1 and 6 (CerS1 and CerS6) play opposing proapoptotic and prosurvival roles, respectively, in human head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). Unexpectedly, knockdown of CerS6/C(16)-ceramide using small interfering RNA induced endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-stress-mediated apoptosis. Reconstitution of C(16)-ceramide generation by induced expression of wild-type CerS6, but not its catalytically inactive mutant, protected cells from cell death induced by knockdown of CerS6. Moreover, using molecular tools coupled with analysis of sphingolipid metabolism showed that generation of C(16)-ceramide, and not dihydro-C(16)-ceramide, by induced expression of CerS6 rescued cells from ER stress and apoptosis. Mechanistically, regulation of ER-stress-induced apoptosis by CerS6/C(16)-ceramide was linked to the activation of a specific arm, ATF6/CHOP, of the unfolded protein response pathway. Notably, while expression of CerS1/C(18)-ceramide inhibited HNSCC xenograft growth, CerS6/C(16)-ceramide significantly protected ER stress, leading to enhanced tumor development and growth in vivo, consistent with their pro- and antiapoptotic roles, respectively. Thus, these data reveal an unexpected and novel prosurvival role of CerS6/C(16)-ceramide involved in the protection against ER-stress-induced apoptosis and induction of HNSCC tumor growth."

We identified a nearly perfect complementarity between miR-206 and the 3′-untranslated regions of both mouse and human notch3.

This suppression was relieved by deletion and mutation of the miR-206-binding site and was partially recovered by expression of notch3 or by a specific inhibitor of miR-206.

In addition to its high expression in muscle, miR-206 was also reported to be expressed in brain associated with schizophrenia (16.Hansen T. Olsen L. Lindow M. Jakobsen K.D. Ullum H. Jonsson E.

Despite a broader tissue-specific expression than originally anticipated, the physiological function of miR-206 in cancer progression remains largely unknown. In this study, we report several novel findings. We identify notch3 (Notch homolog 3) as a novel miR-206 target. We reveal miR-206 as a potent apoptotic cell death inducer via cross-talk with notch3. We further show that miR-206 inhibits tumor cell migration and focus formation. Our study suggests miR-206 as a critical regulator of tumorigenesis. Real-time reverse transcription-PCR quantification of miRNA expression was carried out using a TaqMan® microRNA assay kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Small nucleolar RNA 202 was used as an internal control to normalize RNA input in the real-time reverse transcription-PCR assay. The detailed method was described in our recent study (19.Song G. Wang L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 5727-5735Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The full-length mRNAs of human and mouse notch3 (NM_008716 and NM_000435) were obtained from the NCBI Database. The 3′-UTRs of human and mouse notch3 were extracted and converted to FASTA format. The miRNA mature sequence data base (miRBase) was obtained from the Sanger Institute. The miRanda algorithm was used for finding potential miR-206 target sites in the human and mouse notch3 3′-UTRs. Score threshold was set as −20, and other parameters were the default. Two other algorithms, TargetScan and PicTar, also predicted notch3 as a putative target gene of miR-206. Mouse genomic regions containing the Mus musculus miR-206 hairpins and ∼150 nucleotides of 5′- and 3′-flanking regions were cloned into the pRNAT-CMV3.2 vector between the XhoI and BamHI sites (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ). The specific miR-206 hairpin inhibitor (IH-310462-07) and miRIDIAN miRNA inhibitor negative control 1 (IN-001000-01) were purchased from Dharmacon (Lafayette CO). This miR-206 inhibitor is designed to specifically target miR-206 by blocking the cleavage of precursor miR-206 to mature miR-206. The full-length notch3 expression vector was obtained from Dr. Michael Wang (University of Michigan). To generate the luciferase reporter vectors, notch3 3′-UTR segments were amplified by PCR from the mouse and human cDNAs and inserted into the pMIR-REPORT vector between HindIII and SacI sites (Ambion, Austin, TX). PCR with appropriate primers also generated inserts with deleted miR-206 complementary sites. Wild-type and mutant vectors with deleted miR-206 complementary sites were confirmed by sequencing. Primer sequences are listed in supplemental Table S1. Twenty-four h before transfection, 5 × 104 HeLa cells were plated per well in a 24-well plate. Thirty ng of notch3 3′-UTR-luciferase construct, different concentrations of the miR-206 expression construct, and 30 ng of pSV-β-galactosidase control vector (Promega, Madison, WI) were transfected using FuGENE HD (Roche Applied Science). Thirty-six h after transfection, luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed using the luciferase assay system and Beta-Glo® assay system (Promega). Luciferase activities were normalized to galactosidase activities for each transfected well. For each experiment, wells were transfected in triplicate, and each well was assayed in triplicate. Cells grown in 6-cm culture dishes were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer with protease inhibitors. After a 30-min incubation on ice, cell lysates were sonicated and centrifuged, and the clear supernatants were saved as whole-cell lysate. Cell lysates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes according to standard procedures. Membranes were washed with Tris-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST), blocked for 1 h with TBST containing 5% nonfat milk, and then incubated with primary antibodies (ab23426, Abcam) at 1:000 dilution in TBST containing 5% nonfat milk overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were washed with TBST before incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (3 μg/liter in TBST containing 5% nonfat milk) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed four times with TBST before antibody binding was visualized by SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (catalog no. 34095, Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Apoptosis was assessed and quantified by staining for annexin V-phycoerythrin and 7-aminoactinomycin (Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's protocols. In brief, HeLa cells (1 × 106) were transfected with the expression constructs of miR-206 (6 μg) and/or notch3 (6 μg) for 36 h. Cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline buffer at pH 7.4. After the cells were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 5 min, they were resuspended in 100 μl of binding buffer. Cells (1 × 105) were then stained with annexin V-phycoerythrin (5 μl) and 7-aminoactinomycin (5 μl) by incubation for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. Following this, results were acquired by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur, BD Biosciences) and analyzed by CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Measurements were performed using a kit for caspase 3 (catalog no. K106–100, BioVision, Inc., Mountain View, CA) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. The kits detect specific colorimetric substrates that, when cleaved, increase light absorption at 405 nm. Briefly, HeLa cells were cultured overnight in 60-mm culture dishes and then transfected with the various vectors as indicated. Cells were resuspended in the cell lysis buffer provided with the kits and incubated on ice for 10 min, and cell lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 1 min at 4 °C to collect the supernatants. Protein concentrations were determined using the DC protein assay (catalog no. 500-0112, Bio-Rad). Proteins (200 μg for each assay) were incubated with reaction buffer and substrate at 37 °C for 2 h and then measured in a microtiter plate reader. HeLa cells seeded at 1 × 106 in 5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum were cultured overnight at 37 °C in 6-cm plates. The next day, miR-206 expression vector (6 μg) and/or notch3 plasmid (6 μg) was transfected into HeLa cell using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After 36 h, transfected cells were grown to confluence and wounded by dragging a 1-ml pipette tip through the monolayer. Cells were washed using prewarmed phosphate-buffered saline to remove cellular debris and allowed to migrate for 16 h. Wound closure or cell migration images were photographed when the scrape wound was introduced (0 h) and at a designated time (16 h) after wounding using a DMI6000 inverted microscope. The relative surface traveled by the leading edge was assessed using LAS AF6000 Version 1.8.0 software. The individual gaps were measured at each time point, and the speed of migration was acquired by dividing the length of the gap by the culture time. The residual gap between the migrating cells from the opposing wound edge was expressed as a percentage of the initial scraped area. Three replicates each of two independent experiments were performed. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells (0.5 × 106) in 35-mm plastic dishes were transfected with 3 μg of ptRNA-miR-206 vector. Two days after transfection, transfected cells were suspended with 8 ml of 0.4% top agar (Sigma) and 2× Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum before being poured onto 6-cm tissue culture dishes coated with 3.5 ml of 0.7% bottom agar. The plates were prepared in triplicate. Fourteen days later, three areas/plate were chosen randomly, the number of visible colonies was counted, and the size of the colonies was measured. Green fluorescence was used as a marker to determine whether the cells were transfected with a GFP-control or GFP-miR-206 vector. Only foci formed from GFP-control or GFP-miR-206 vector-transfected cells were used for statistical analysis. For a detailed method, see Ref. 20.He N. Park K. Zhang Y. Huang J. Lu S. Wang L. Gastroenterology. 2008; 134: 793-802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar. All experiments were repeated at least three times, and error bars represent S.E. Statistical analyses were carried out using Student's unpaired t test; p < 0.01 was considered statistically significant. In search for miR-206 target genes, we identified a nearly perfect complementarity between miR-206 and the 3′-UTR of both mouse and human notch3 (including the seed region) using the miRanda algorithm (Fig. 1A, left), which was confirmed by TargetScan and PicTar. The conservation of the seed match region between miR-206 and the notch3 3′-UTR was also observed in other species (supplemental Fig. S1). To elucidate the role of miR-206 in regulating notch3 expression and function, we constructed a miR-206 expression plasmid. When the miR-206 expression vector was transfected into human cervical cancer HeLa cells, the expression of miR-206 was highly induced as determined by real-time PCR analysis (Fig. 1A, right). HeLa cells had minimal endogenous miR-206 expression, which provided a good in vitro cell model system to determine a real interaction between exogenously expressed miR-206 and notch3 and should exclude effects from endogenous miR-206. To determine whether miR-206 can decrease the expression of notch3, we used a luciferase reporter assay. Cotransfection of cells with the parental luciferase construct (without the notch3 3′-UTR) plus the miR-206 expression plasmid did not change the expression of the reporter (data not shown). However, miR-206 dose-dependently decreased the luciferase activity when cotransfected with the mouse notch3 3′-UTR containing the miR-206 target site (Fig. 1B, left). The inhibitory effect of miR-206 on mouse notch3 3′-UTR activity was partially rescued by coexpression of a full-length notch3 plasmid, suggesting that notch3 was effective in inhibiting the ability of miR-206 to inhibit the expression of the reporter gene containing the miR-206-binding site. The data indicated that notch3 was able to counteract miR-206 function. Expression of notch3 did not fully restore the reporter activity, which may be associated with the lower amount of vector used for overexpression. In addition, suppression of the notch3 3′-UTR by miR-206 was relieved by deletion (Fig. 1B, right) or mutation (supplemental Fig. S2A) of the miR-206-binding site and was markedly recovered by a specific miR-206 inhibitor (Fig. 1C) whose function is to block the cleavage of precursor miR-206 to mature miR-206 (21.Vermeulen A. Robertson B. Dalby A.B. Marshall W.S. Karpilow J. Leake D. Khvorova A. Baskerville S. RNA. 2007; 13: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In contrast, a non-related miRNA, cel-miR-64, which was not predicted to target notch3, did not show any effect on the expression of luciferase. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-206 markedly decreased the levels of endogenous mouse Notch3 protein (Fig. 1D) in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), whereas cel-miR-64 had no effect on mouse Notch33 protein expression. Interestingly, ectopic expression of miR-206 also inhibited mRNA expression of mouse notch3 in MEFs (Fig. 1E). MEFs were used because our pilot study showed that these cells expressed higher levels of notch3, which would provide a better detection system for notch3 down-regulation by miR-206. Because the miR-206 target site was also observed in the human notch3 3′-UTR, we tested the effect of miR-206 on human Notch3 expression in HeLa cells. As expected, miR-206 showed a strong inhibitory effect on normal (Fig. 2A, left) but not deleted (Fig. 2A, right) or mutated (supplemental Fig. S2B) human notch3 3′-UTR-luciferase activity. Similarly, forced expression of full-length notch3 largely rescued the repressive effect of miR-206 on human notch3 3′-UTR-luciferase activity (Fig. 2A, left). When the cells were treated with a specific inhibitor of miR-206, the repression of the human notch3 3′-UTR by miR-206 was moderately released (Fig. 2B, left), suggesting that a higher dose of the miR-206 inhibitor would be required to efficiently block the inhibitory effect of miR-206 on the activity of the human notch3 3′-UTR. Real-time PCR analysis confirmed that the expression of miR-206 was induced in HeLa cells transfected with the miR-206 vector, which was completely repressed by a higher concentration of the miR-206 inhibitor (Fig. 2B, right). Next, we determined the inhibitory effect of miR-206 on endogenous human Notch3 protein expression using HeLa cells. As expected, ectopic expression of miR-206 resulted in a significant reduction of human Notch3 protein expression (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S3A). In addition, the level of human notch3 mRNA was also repressed by miR-206 (Fig. 2D). Similar observations were also reported for other miRNAs and their target mRNAs (22.Lim L.P. Lau N.C.

Heart J. 2009; 50: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We have shown recently that the nuclear receptor SHP activates miR-206 gene expression via a cascade dual inhibitory mechanism (25.Song G. Wang L. PLoS ONE. 2009; 4: e6880Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Endogenous miR-206 expression was ∼5-fold lower in SHP−/− relative to SHP+/+ MEFs (supplemental Fig. S3B). We transfected both mouse and human notch3 3′-UTRs into MEFs without coexpression of miR-206 and predicted that the basal luciferase activities of mouse and human notch3 3′-UTRs would be higher in SHP−/− compared with SHP+/+ cells. Indeed, an elevated expression of luciferase was observed in SHP−/− cells transfected with the mouse (Fig. 2E, left) and human (Fig. 2E, middle) notch3 3′-UTRs but not with the non-related 3′-UTR of glucokinase (Fig. 2E, right). Overall, the above results identified notch3 as a novel target gene of miR-206. notch3 was reported to resist Fas ligand-induced apoptosis in smooth muscle cells (26.Wang W. Prince C.Z. Mou Y. Pollman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21723-21729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), suggesting a potential role of notch3 in regulating apoptosis signaling. We investigated whether miR-206 may be an active component of the apoptotic pathway via cross-talk with notch3. Forced expression of miR-206 (Fig. 3A, left) resulted in an ∼3-fold increase in apoptotic cell death in HeLa cells, and the percentage of apoptotic cells induced by miR-206 was decreased to the basal level when the cells were treated with the specific miR-206 inhibitor (Fig. 3A, middle), demonstrating the potent pro-apoptotic effect of miR-206. Consistent with this, caspase 3 activity in cells was increased by miR-206, and the activation was blocked by the miR-206 inhibitor (Fig. 3A, right). The above studies showed that the expression of notch3 was decreased by miR-206; thus, we predicted that miR-206 might be involved in the negative regulation of anti-apoptosis signaling by notch3. As expected, cells overexpressing miR-206 showed increased apoptotic cell death (Fig. 3B, left). In contrast, expression of notch3 exhibited the anti-apoptotic effect by decreasing the basal cellular apoptosis. When miR-206 and notch3 were coexpressed in cells, the apoptosis inhibited by Notch3 was largely rescued by miR-206. The expression of miR-206 and notch3 was confirmed by real-time and semiquantitative PCR analysis, respectively (Fig. 3B, middle and right). Overexpression of notch3 did not alter the level of miR-206 (Fig. 3B, middle), whereas overexpression of miR-206 decreased the mRNA expression of notch3 (Fig. 3B, left). Thus, there existed a cross-talk between miR-206 and notch3 in regulating apoptosis signaling. The mechanism of cancer formation is associated with the inhibition of tumor cell apoptosis or activation of cell proliferation. Our preliminary studies did not reveal a marked effect of miR-206 on cellular growth (data not shown). Because miR-206 strongly activated apoptosis, we tested the tumor inhibitory effect of miR-206. We first determined the effect of miR-206 on the inhibition of HeLa cell migration using wound healing assays. As shown in Fig. 4, overexpression of miR-206 resulted in an ∼50% decrease in the cell migration rate compared with the control group, and the effect of miR-206 was attenuated by the miR-206 inhibitor. Expression of notch3 moderately decreased cell migration under basal conditions, which was largely inhibited by coexpression of miR-206. Because the transfection efficiency was ∼60–70% and not all cells were transfected with the vectors, the data were thus considered significant. We next determined whether miR-206 inhibits HeLa cells to form foci. As expected, expression of miR-206 significantly prevented the formation of foci by HeLa cells in soft agar, as indicated by the markedly decreased number and size of foci in miR-206-overexpressing cells. The inhibitory effect of miR-206 was blocked, although not fully but significantly, by the miR-206 inhibitor (Fig. 5), demonstrating the specific effect of miR-206. It was noted that the efficacy of the miR-206 inhibitor to reverse the effect of miR-206 was not as strong as in prior studies. Because focus formation assays took >2 weeks to complete compared with other studies that took only a few days, it was likely that the efficiency of the miR-206 inhibitor was decreased with time when the foci were formed. Nonetheless, miR-206 exhibited a striking and impressive effect in suppressing focus formation. We could not examine the counteracting effect of miR-206 with notch3 in focus formation because the notch3 expression vector did not have GFP or another fluorescence tag as a marker to indicate cells that were transfected with the vector. Based on the results from the above experiments, it is tempting to predict that such a counteracting effect between miR-206 and notch3 would be observed. Despite increasing evidence pointing to a role for miRNAs in apoptotic cell signaling and tumor progression, the tumor-suppressive or oncogenic effect of miRNAs has not been explored extensively. In this study, we identified notch3 as a target of miR-206 and revealed a novel function of miR-206 in activating cellular apoptosis and suppressing tumor growth via cross-talk with notch3. A major finding of this study is the identification of notch3 as a target of miR-206. Although it is generally believed that miRNAs regulate gene expression through decreased translation or increased degradation of the target message (1.Filipowicz W. Bhattacharyya S.N. Sonenberg N. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2008; 9: 102-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (4174) Google Scholar), our study shows that both mouse and human notch3 are down-regulated at both the protein and mRNA levels by miR-206. This suggests that miR-206 regulation of its target gene is not restricted at the post-transcriptional level but also occurs at the transcriptional level. Inhibition of the Notch3 protein level by miR-206 is via direct miR-206 binding to the 3′-UTR of notch3. The mechanism of miR-206 inhibition of notch3 mRNA expression is currently unclear. Lim et al. (22.Lim L.P. Lau N.C. Garrett-Engele P. Grimson A. Schelter J.M. Castle J. Bartel D.P. Linsley P.S. Johnson J.M. Nature. 2005; 433: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (4007) Google Scholar) reported that some miRNAs down-regulate large numbers of target mRNAs. Another group reported that the mRNA and protein levels of transforming growth factor-β and SMAD3 are decreased by a virus-encoded microRNA, miR-LAT (23.Gupta A. Gartner J.J. Sethupathy P. Hatzigeorgiou A.G. Fraser N.W. Nature. 2006; 442: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). The mRNA and protein levels of Bcl-2 are also down-regulated by miR-1 (24.Tang Y. Zheng J. Sun Y. Wu Z. Liu Z. Huang G. Int. Heart J. 2009; 50: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Thus, our result is not unusual and provides new evidence to support the conclusion that miRNAs regulate not only the stability and translation but also the transcription of target mRNAs; the latter is most likely via an indirect mechanism. Another major finding of this study is the identification of miR-206 as a potent inducer of apoptosis, which is associated with its tumor suppressor function. Although the function of miR-206 has been well established in skeletal muscle physiology (10.Kim H.K. Lee Y.S. Sivaprasad U. Malhotra A. Dutta A. J. Cell Biol. 2006; 174: 677-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 11.Anderson C. Catoe H. Werner R.

U.S.A. 2006; 103: 8721-8726Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar), the role of miR-206 in other tissues, particularly in cancer progression, has largely remained unstudied. Our study provides several lines of evidence for a tumor suppressor function of miR-206. We have shown that miR-206 functions as a potent pro-apoptotic inducer, suggesting a general function of miR-206 in activating apoptosis signaling. miR-206-mediated inhibition of notch3 expression and the antagonizing effect of miR-206 against the anti-apoptotic effect of notch3 strongly suggest a pivotal role for miR-206 in regulating the oncogenic function of notch3 and its involvement in the pathogenesis of cancer. We propose that miR-206 functions as a tumor suppressor and is a central component of apoptosis signaling and that up-regulation of miR-206 inhibits the tumorigenic progression of cancer. Indeed, elevated levels of miR-206 inhibited tumor cell migration and focus formation. Although further work is needed to fully characterize the mechanism by which miR-206 activates apoptosis and inhibits tumor growth in vivo, these data suggest that miR-206 serves as a potential tumor suppressor and a critical factor in regulating tumorigenesis.

https://openalex.org/W2135332617,"By facilitating independent shifts in species' distributions, climate disruption may result in the rapid development of novel species assemblages that challenge the capacity of species to co-exist and adapt. We used a multivariate approach borrowed from paleoecology to quantify the potential change in California terrestrial breeding bird communities based on current and future species-distribution models for 60 focal species. Projections of future no-analog communities based on two climate models and two species-distribution-model algorithms indicate that by 2070 over half of California could be occupied by novel assemblages of bird species, implying the potential for dramatic community reshuffling and altered patterns of species interactions. The expected percentage of no-analog bird communities was dependent on the community scale examined, but consistent geographic patterns indicated several locations that are particularly likely to host novel bird communities in the future. These no-analog areas did not always coincide with areas of greatest projected species turnover. Efforts to conserve and manage biodiversity could be substantially improved by considering not just future changes in the distribution of individual species, but including the potential for unprecedented changes in community composition and unanticipated consequences of novel species assemblages."
https://openalex.org/W2168793854,"Triacylglycerol accumulation in insulin target tissues is associated with insulin resistance. Paradoxically, mice with global targeted deletion of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), the rate-limiting enzyme in triacylglycerol hydrolysis, display improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity despite triacylglycerol accumulation in multiple tissues. To determine the molecular mechanisms for this phenotype, ATGL-deficient (ATGL−/−) and wild-type mice were injected with saline or insulin (10 units/kg, intraperitoneally), and then phosphorylation and activities of key insulin-signaling proteins were determined in insulin target tissues (liver, adipose tissue, and muscle). Insulin signaling and/or glucose transport was also evaluated in isolated adipocytes and skeletal muscle ex vivo. In ATGL−/− mice, insulin-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and Akt activities as well as phosphorylation of critical residues of IRS1 (Tyr(P)-612) and Akt (Ser(P)-473) were increased in skeletal muscle in vivo. Insulin-stimulated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity and total insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate 1, but not other parameters, were also increased in white adipose tissue in vivo. In contrast, in vivo measures of insulin signaling were decreased in brown adipose tissue and liver. Interestingly, the enhanced components of insulin signaling identified in skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue in vivo and their expected downstream effects on glucose transport were not present ex vivo. ATGL deficiency altered intramyocellular lipids as well as serum factors known to influence insulin sensitivity. Thus, skeletal muscle, rather than other tissues, primarily contributes to enhanced insulin sensitivity in ATGL−/− mice in vivo despite triacylglycerol accumulation, and both local and systemic factors contribute to tissue-specific effects of global ATGL deficiency on insulin action.

The ability to store and release this energy in response to variable energy availability requires a carefully regulated balance between TAG synthesis and hydrolysis. In the setting of chronic energy excess, however, TAGs and other lipid metabolites accumulate in adipose tissue as well as in metabolically relevant non-adipose tissues where they have been proposed to contribute to cellular dysfunction via a process known as lipotoxicity (1Schaffer J.E. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2003; 14: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 2Unger R.H. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5159-5165Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 3van Herpen N.A. Schrauwen-Hinderling V.B. Physiol. Behav. 2008; 94: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Indeed, intracellular TAG accumulation has been repeatedly associated with metabolic dysfunction, a relationship that is particularly strong for insulin resistance (1Schaffer J.E. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2003; 14: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (702) Google Scholar, 2Unger R.H. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 5159-5165Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar, 3van Herpen N.A. Schrauwen-Hinderling V.B. Physiol. Behav. 2008; 94: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Despite this strong association, however, intracellular TAG accumulation is not always associated with insulin resistance (4Liu L. Zhang Y. Chen N. Shi X. Tsang B. Yu Y.H. J. Clin. Invest. 2007; 117: 1679-1689Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar) and may even be associated with insulin sensitivity, as is the case with highly trained endurance athletes (the so-called “athlete paradox”) (5Goodpaster B.H. He J. Watkins S. Kelley D.E. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 2001; 86: 5755-5761Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar). Thus, the contribution of intracellular TAGs and TAG metabolism per se to lipotoxicity remains controversial. What is clear is that lipid-induced insulin resistance is a major risk factor for morbidity and mortality from a variety of causes, including overt diabetes mellitus, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular disease. Hence, understanding the mechanisms by which dysregulated TAG metabolism contributes to steatosis, lipotoxicity, and insulin resistance is essential to understanding and treating these increasingly prevalent disorders. triacylglycerol adipose triglyceride lipase brown adipose tissue diacylglycerol fatty acid or fatty acyl fatty acyl-CoA insulin receptor insulin receptor substrate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase white adipose tissue nonesterified fatty acid extensor digitorum longus glucose tolerance test insulin tolerance test analysis of variance mass spectrometry glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase wild type hormone-sensitive lipase. triacylglycerol adipose triglyceride lipase brown adipose tissue diacylglycerol fatty acid or fatty acyl fatty acyl-CoA insulin receptor insulin receptor substrate phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase white adipose tissue nonesterified fatty acid extensor digitorum longus glucose tolerance test insulin tolerance test analysis of variance mass spectrometry glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase wild type hormone-sensitive lipase. Although no mechanistic data have been identified directly linking intracellular TAGs per se to insulin resistance, lipotoxicity may occur when the capacity of the lipid droplets to effectively store TAGs is exceeded. Several other lipid metabolites that are products of TAG hydrolysis (i.e. diacylglyerols (DAGs), fatty acids (FAs), fatty acyl-CoAs (FA-CoAs), and ceramides) have been shown to directly or indirectly interfere with insulin signaling and glucose transport via a variety of mechanisms (6Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2173) Google Scholar, 7Summers S.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 42-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 8Lewis G.F. Carpentier A.

Under normal physiological circumstances, insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR), thereby triggering its intrinsic protein-tyrosine kinase activity. The subsequent autophosphorylation of several IR tyrosine residues promotes the recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation of IR substrates (IRSs) followed by activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and Akt, which in turn promote the pleiotrophic downstream effects of insulin. The above lipid metabolites have been shown to increase serine/threonine phosphorylation and decrease tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1, decrease serine/threonine phosphorylation of Akt, decrease IRS1-associated PI3K activity and Akt activity, and decrease Glut4 translocation (6Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2173) Google Scholar, 7Summers S.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 42-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 8Lewis G.F. Carpentier A.

Possible mechanisms by which these lipid metabolites may influence glucose homeostasis and insulin action include competition for substrate oxidation, interference with cellular energy sensing, regulation of gene expression, promotion of oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction, and activation of inflammatory and apoptotic pathways (6Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (2173) Google Scholar, 7Summers S.A. Prog. Lipid Res. 2006; 45: 42-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (627) Google Scholar, 8Lewis G.F. Carpentier A.

However, most studies evaluating the role of lipotoxicity in insulin resistance have focused on cellular lipid uptake or oxidation, both of which produce unidirectional changes in intracellular TAGs and other intracellular lipid metabolites and hence do not adequately address the role of intracellular TAGs and TAG metabolism per se to this process. Understanding the role of TAG metabolism in lipotoxicity and insulin resistance has been further complicated by the fact that the rate-limiting enzyme for TAG hydrolysis, adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), has only recently been identified (10Zimmermann R. Strauss J.G. Haemmerle G. Schoiswohl G. Birner-Gruenberger R. Riederer M. Lass A. Neuberger G. Eisenhaber F. Hermetter A. Zechner R.

ATGL has been most extensively studied in adipose tissue where it mediates the hydrolysis of long chain fatty acyl TAGs (10Zimmermann R. Strauss J.G. Haemmerle G. Schoiswohl G. Birner-Gruenberger R. Riederer M. Lass A. Neuberger G. Eisenhaber F. Hermetter A. Zechner R. Science. 2004; 306: 1383-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar). ATGL is also expressed in other tissues, including liver, muscle, and pancreas (13Kershaw E.E. Hamm J.K. Verhagen L.A. Peroni O. Katic M. Flier J.S. Diabetes. 2006; 55: 148-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), where its contribution to tissue-specific and systemic metabolism is less well understood. Mice with global targeted deletion of ATGL (ATGL−/− mice) have severe defects in TAG hydrolysis, leading to TAG accumulation in virtually all tissues (14Haemmerle G. Lass A. Zimmermann R. Gorkiewicz G. Meyer C. Rozman J. Heldmaier G. Maier R. Theussl C. Eder S. Kratky D. Wagner E.F. Klingenspor M. Hoefler G. Zechner R. Science. 2006; 312: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, despite increased adiposity and “ectopic” TAG accumulation, which are characteristically associated with insulin resistance, ATGL−/− mice paradoxically exhibit enhanced glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (14Haemmerle G. Lass A. Zimmermann R. Gorkiewicz G. Meyer C. Rozman J. Heldmaier G. Maier R. Theussl C. Eder S. Kratky D. Wagner E.F. Klingenspor M. Hoefler G. Zechner R. Science. 2006; 312: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). This finding has largely been attributed to the effect of reduced systemic FA delivery on energy substrate availability (14Haemmerle G. Lass A. Zimmermann R. Gorkiewicz G. Meyer C. Rozman J. Heldmaier G. Maier R. Theussl C. Eder S. Kratky D. Wagner E.F. Klingenspor M. Hoefler G. Zechner R. Science. 2006; 312: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). However, the contribution of altered tissue-specific insulin action to this phenotype has not been evaluated. ATGL−/− mice represent a unique model for examining the contribution of intracellular TAG accumulation to glucose homeostasis and insulin action because intracellular TAG accumulation is dissociated from systemic FA delivery, and presumably also from the production/accumulation of other intracellular lipid metabolites. In addition, ATGL−/− mice differ from the other models in which increased adiposity is paradoxically associated with insulin sensitivity in that enhanced expansion of adipose tissue mass and reduced systemic FA delivery do not protect against ectopic lipid deposition in ATGL−/− mice (15Kim J.Y. van de Wall E.

Czech M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 7833-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The aims of this study were to evaluate the mechanisms by which impaired TAG hydrolysis and intracellular TAG accumulation because of global ATGL deficiency promote whole-body glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity and to define the contribution of tissue-specific changes in insulin action to this phenotype. Here we demonstrate that global ATGL deficiency in mice not only reduces energy substrate availability but also produces tissue-specific changes in insulin action. Mice were housed under standard conditions at 25 °C with a 14:10 h light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to water and standard chow diet (Harlan Teklad RD 8664). Mice were handled in accordance with guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health. Experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. ATGL−/− mice were generated on a mixed genetic background (50% C57BL/6 and 50% 129/Ola) as described (14Haemmerle G. Lass A. Zimmermann R. Gorkiewicz G. Meyer C. Rozman J. Heldmaier G. Maier R.

The targeted ATGL allele was then backcrossed onto the obesogenic/diabetogenic C57BL/6 background strain for >10 generations. Experimental mice were generated by breeding ATGL+/− or ATGL−/− males to ATGL+/− females. Because ATGL−/− mice develop premature morbidity and mortality as well as profound hypothermia and hypometabolism (torpor) in response to prolonged fasting (14Haemmerle G. Lass A. Zimmermann R. Gorkiewicz G. Meyer C. Rozman J. Heldmaier G. Maier R. Theussl C. Eder S. Kratky D. Wagner E.F. Klingenspor M. Hoefler G. Zechner R. Science. 2006; 312: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar), studies were performed under more physiological conditions (short term fasting of 6–8 h) using mice less than 14 weeks of age. Body composition was determined in awake mice using EchoMRI (Echo Medical Systems). Plasma glucose was measured using a One-touch FastTake glucometer (Lifescan). For insulin and glucose tolerance tests (ITT and GTT, respectively), awake mice were injected intraperitoneally with human insulin (HumulinR; Lilly) at 0.75 units per kg of body weight (ITT) or with 20% d-glucose at 1.5 g per kg of body weight (GTT) followed by blood sampling at the times indicated. Serum insulin was determined using the rat insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Crystal Chem). Serum resistin and adiponectin were determined using Lincoplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Millipore). Serum retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) was determined using anti-human RBP4 polyclonal antibody (Dako) as described (17Yang Q. Graham T.E. Mody N. Preitner F. Peroni O.D. Zabolotny J.M. Kotani K. Quadro L. Kahn B.B. Nature. 2005; 436: 356-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1661) Google Scholar). Serum nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) and TAGs were determined using the HR Series NEFA-HR(2) colorimetric assay (Wako Chemical Industries) and the Triglyceride Liquicolor colorimetric assay (StanBio Laboratory), respectively. Liver glycogen was assayed according to Adamo and Graham (18Adamo K.B. Graham T.E. J. Appl. Physiol. 1998; 84: 908-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) with modifications. Liver was homogenized on ice in 0.03 m HCl per 100 mg of tissue. Aliquots of 500 μl were mixed with equal volumes of 2 m HCl and then neutralized by adding 500 μl of 2 m NaOH for the determination of free glucose or subjected to continued incubation for 2 h at 99 °C to determine total glucose. Samples were then centrifuged for 30 min at 14,000 × g, 4 °C, and glucose concentration in the supernatant was measured using Thermo Trace glucose oxidase reagent (Thermo Electron). Glycogen-derived glucose was calculated by subtracting free from total glucose. For insulin signaling studies in vivo, 6-h fasted mice were injected intraperitoneally with insulin at 10 units per kg body weight. Ten min thereafter, mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and tissues were collected. For muscle insulin signaling studies ex vivo, soleus muscles were rapidly dissected from 6-h fasted mice after sacrifice by cervical dislocation and preincubated for 30 min in pre-gassed (95% O2, 5% CO2) Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm Hepes (KHB + Hepes) at 35 °C. Contralateral muscles were then incubated for 10 min in buffer with or without 33 nm insulin. Muscles were removed, blotted dry, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C until processing. Tissues were homogenized in ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm Na4P2O7, 100 mm NaF, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 14 μm leupeptin, 1 μm aprotinin). Lysates were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and supernatants were stored at −80 °C until analysis. Lysate protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE (Criterion, Bio-Rad) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman Protran, Fisher). Phosphorylated and total proteins were identified by immunoblotting using the following primary antibodies: anti-pIR (Tyr(P)-1162/ Tyr(P)-1163) polyclonal, anti-pIR (Tyr(P)-972) polyclonal, and anti-pIRS1 (Tyr(P)-612) polyclonal (Invitrogen); anti-IRβ polyclonal and anti-IRα polyclonal (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); anti-IRS1 polyclonal, anti-pAkt (Ser(P)-473) monoclonal, and anti-Akt polyclonal (Millipore); anti-pAkt (Thr(P)-308) monoclonal (Cell Signaling); anti-GAPDH polyclonal (Imgenex); and anti-Ran GTPase monoclonal (BD Biosciences). Immunoblots were developed using a Western blot chemiluminescence reagent (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Densitometric analysis was performed using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health). For PI3K activity, tissue lysates (liver and gastrocnemius muscle, 500 μg of protein; white and brown adipose, 300 μg; soleus muscle, 100 μg) were subjected to immunoprecipitation overnight at 4 °C with 4 μg of polyclonal anti-IRS1 antibody (Millipore) or 2 μl of polyclonal anti-IRS2 (gift from Morris White, Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston) coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma). For Akt activity, tissue lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation for 4 h at 4 °C with 4 μg of anti-Akt monoclonal antibody (Millipore) coupled to protein G-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare). The immune complexes were washed, and PI3K and Akt activities were determined as described previously (19Kim Y.B. Nikoulina S.E. Ciaraldi T.P. Henry R.R. Kahn B.B. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: 733-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Glucose transport into muscle ex vivo was determined according to Zisman et al. (20Zisman A. Peroni O.D. Abel E.D. Michael M.D. Mauvais-Jarvis F. Lowell B.B. Wojtaszewski J.F. Hirshman M.F. Virkamaki A. Goodyear L.J. Kahn C.R. Kahn B.B. Nat. Med. 2000; 6: 924-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar) with modifications. Soleus and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles were rapidly dissected from 6-h fasted mice after sacrifice by cervical dislocation. Muscles were then preincubated for 1 h in KHB + Hepes supplemented with 10 mm d-glucose at 35 °C, and rinsed by incubation for 10 min in KHB + Hepes supplemented with 10 mm d-mannitol. Glucose transport was assessed by subsequent incubation in KHB + Hepes containing 1 mm 2-deoxyglucose, 9 mm mannitol, 1.5 μCi/ml 2-deoxy-d-[1,2-3H]glucose (American Radiolabeled Chemicals), and 0.3 μCi/ml d-[1-14C]mannitol (American Radiolabeled Chemicals) for 20 min at 29 °C. To determine basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport in contralateral muscles, all buffers were pre-gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 and supplemented with equal volumes of saline or 33 nm insulin, respectively. After the final incubation, muscles were removed, blotted dry, trimmed, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Later, the muscles were weighed and digested for 30 min in 300 μl of 1 m NaOH at 65 °C and centrifuged at 13,000 × g for 10 min at ambient temperature. Radioactivity in the supernatant was determined by liquid scintillation counting for dual labels, and glucose transport into myotubes was calculated. Glucose uptake in isolated adipocytes was determined using conditions in which glucose uptake is directly proportional to transport as described previously (21Tozzo E. Gnudi L. Kahn B.B. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 1604-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, adipocytes were isolated from epididymal fat pads by collagenase (1 mg/ml) digestion. A fraction of isolated adipocytes was used to determine the average cell number and volume (μg of lipid/cell) (22Cushman S.W. Salans L.B. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 269-273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The remaining adipocytes were incubated at 37 °C with constant agitation in a 10% (v/v) suspension of Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 20 mm Hepes, 2.5% bovine serum albumin (fraction V), and 200 nm adenosine for 30 min with 0, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 1, 5, or 100 nm insulin. Glucose uptake into adipocytes was assayed by the subsequent incubation with 3 mm [U-14C]glucose (286 mCi/mmol; Amersham Biosciences) for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by brief centrifugation over dinonyl phthalate oil, and the radioactivity in the cell layer (supernatant) was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Oil Red O staining of neutral lipids in skeletal muscle was performed as described (23Koopman R. Schaart G. Hesselink M.K. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 116: 63-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). For biochemical analysis of TAGs, DAGs, and ceramides, soleus muscle lipids were extracted using the method of Folch et al. (24Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The organic solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, and lipid extracts were stored at −20 °C until processing. For TAG analysis, lipids were resuspended in ice-cold 1% Triton X-100 by sonication. TAG concentration was determined using a colorimetric kit assay (Thermo Trace; Thermo Scientific). To determine ceramide concentrations, lipid extracts were redissolved in 400 μl of CHCl3/MetOH/H2O (16:16:5, v/v), followed by addition of 400 μl of 0.2 n methanolic NaOH and incubation for 45 min at ambient temperature under constant shaking. Thereafter, 400 μl of 0.5 m EDTA and 150 μl of 1 n acetic acid were added (25Guan X.L. Wenk M.R. Yeast. 2006; 23: 465-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). After lipid extraction using CHCl3, the organic solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen, and lipids were redissolved in acetonitrile/isopropyl alcohol (5:2, v/v) containing 1% NH4 acetate and 0.1% formic acid for high pressure liquid chromatography-MS/MS analysis. Ceramides were analyzed by tandem mass spectroscopy using a Quantum TSQ (Thermo Electron) coupled to the Accela UPLC system (Thermo Electron). For DAG analysis, lipid extracts were directly redissolved in acetonitrile/isopropyl alcohol (5:2, v/v) containing 1% NH4 acetate and 0.1% formic acid and analyzed using the Accela UPLC-LTQ-FT MS system (Thermo Electron). FA-CoAs were determined by on-line SPE-LC-MS according to the method of Magnes et al. (26Magnes C. Suppan M. Pieber T.R. Moustafa T. Trauner M. Haemmerle G. Sinner F.M. Anal. Chem. 2008; 80: 5736-5742Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Total RNA was extracted from homogenized tissues using RNeasy lipid tissue mini kit with on-column DNase treatment (Qiagen). Reverse transcription of 1 μg of total RNA was performed using random decamers (RETROscript kit, Ambion, Inc.). Gene expression was determined by quantitative PCR (7300 real time PCR system, Applied Biosystems). Reactions were performed in triplicate in 25 μl containing 2.5 μl of 1:100 diluted cDNA, 1× Taqman Universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems), and gene-specific primer-probe sets (Taqman Gene Expression Assays, Applied Biosystems). Reactions were run at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 1 min. Gene expression was determined by the standard curve method and normalized to expression of cyclophilin as reference gene (forward 5′-GGTAGGAGAGCACCAAGACAGA, reverse 5′-GCCGGAGTCGACAATAGATAG, and probe 5′-AGCCGGGACAAGCCACTAGAAGGAT). Appropriate analysis was performed to determine that expression of control genes was unchanged under the experimental conditions described. Accuracy of RNA quantification was optimized by DNase treatment of samples, use of gene-specific primer-probe sets that span intron-exon boundaries, and verification of lack of amplification in no-reverse transcriptase and no-template controls. Results are expressed as means ± S.E. Comparisons between groups were made by unpaired two-tailed Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), as appropriate. Where differences were found by ANOVA, post hoc analysis was performed using Bonferroni's multiple comparison test. For glucose transport into isolated adipocytes, nonlinear regression was used to generate a best fit concentration-response curve using a variable slope sigmoidal (Hill) equation with no constraints. For all analyses, p values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Because previous observations of improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity were identified in anesthetized ATGL−/− mice on a mixed genetic background (14Haemmerle G. Lass A. Zimmermann R. Gorkiewicz G. Meyer C. Rozman J. Heldmaier G. Maier R. Theussl C. Eder S. Kratky D. Wagner E.F. Klingenspor M. Hoefler G. Zechner R. Science. 2006; 312: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar), we first confirmed the effect of global ATGL deficiency on body weight, body composition, glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity in awake mice on a pure C57BL/6 background. ATGL−/− mice on a C57BL/6 background developed significantly increased body weight compared with wild-type (WT) mice as early as 5–6 weeks of age (Fig. 1A), much earlier than mice on a mixed background (14Haemmerle G. Lass A. Zimmermann R. Gorkiewicz G. Meyer C. Rozman J. Heldmaier G. Maier R. Theussl C. Eder S. Kratky D. Wagner E.F. Klingenspor M. Hoefler G. Zechner R. Science. 2006; 312: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (1000) Google Scholar). This increase in body weight was entirely due to increased fat mass (Fig. 1B) and not due to altered lean mass (Fig. 1C). The GTT, which reflects both insulin-independent and -dependent glucose disposal, revealed reduced serum glucose in ATGL−/− mice at 0, 15, and 120 min following glucose injection (Fig. 1D) as well as a reduced area under the curve (Fig. 1D, inset), consistent with improved glucose tolerance. Interestingly, measurement of serum insulin during the GTT revealed drastically reduced serum insulin at all time points, suggesting that enhanced glucose tolerance in ATGL−/− mice under t"
https://openalex.org/W2072948925,"Ligand-mediated endocytosis is an intricate regulatory mechanism for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signal transduction. Coordinated trafficking of EGFR ensures its temporal and spatial communication with downstream signaling effectors. We focused our work on Rab5, a monomeric GTPase shown to participate in early stages of the endocytic pathway. Rab5 has three isoforms (A, B, and C) sharing more than 90% of sequence identity. We individually ablated endogenous isoforms in HeLa cells with short interfering RNAs and examined the loss-of-function phenotypes. We found that suppression of Rab5A or 5B hampered the degradation of EGFR, whereas Rab5C depletion had very little effect. The differential delay of EGFR degradation also corresponds with retarded progression of EGFR from early to late endosomes. We investigated the activators/effectors of Rab5A that can potentially separate its potency in EGFR degradation from other isoforms and found that Rin1, a Rab5 exchange factor, preferably associated with Rab5A. Moreover, Rab5A activation is sensitive to EGF stimulation, and suppression of Rin1 diminished this sensitivity. Based on our results together with previous work showing that Rin1 interacts with signal transducing adapter molecule to facilitate the degradation of EGFR (Kong, C., Su, X., Chen, P. I., and Stahl, P. D. (2007) J. Biol. Chem. 282, 15294–15301), we hypothesize that the selective association of Rab5A and Rin1 contributes to the dominance of Rab5A in EGFR trafficking, whereas the other isoforms may have major functions unrelated to the EGFR degradation pathway.

Rabs are small molecular weight guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) that specialize in regulating different stages of the intracellular membrane trafficking based on their subcellular localization and interacting protein scaffolds (2Zerial M. McBride H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 107-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (2706) Google Scholar). The increasing number of Rab family members during evolution reflects ongoing specialization of membrane trafficking pathways. At least 63 Rabs have been identified in humans. Among these, Rab5 serves as the master regulator of the endocytic trafficking (3Bucci C. Lütcke A. Steele-Mortimer O. Olkkonen V.M. Dupree P. Chiariello M. Bruni C.B. Simons K. Zerial M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It functions through recruitment of specific effector proteins involved in membrane tethering and docking (4Christoforidis S.

Cell. 1997; 90: 1149-1159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). The demonstration that at least 20 cytosolic proteins specifically interact with active Rab5 highlights the complexity of the downstream regulation by this GTPase and raises the possibility that Rab5 might also manage other aspects of the endosome function (4Christoforidis S. McBride H.M. Burgoyne R.D. Zerial M. Nature. 1999; 397: 621-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 9Nielsen E. Severin F. Backer J.M. Hyman A.A. Zerial M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 376-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). A common feature of the Rab family small GTPases is the existence of subgroups of structurally related isoforms sharing a high sequence identity (10Gurkan C. Lapp H. Alory C. Su A.I. Hogenesch J.B. Balch W.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3847-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The Rab5 subgroup has three isoforms (A, B, and C) (3Bucci C. Lütcke A. Steele-Mortimer O. Olkkonen V.M. Dupree P. Chiariello M. Bruni C.B. Simons K. Zerial M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 366: 65-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). A large scale mRNA expression profiling study from 79 human and 61 mouse nonredundant tissues shows distinct tissue distributions of the Rab5 isoforms, suggesting that the trafficking properties of the early endosomal network in developmentally distinct cell and tissue types is likely fine-tuned to fulfill subspecializations of a given pathway (10Gurkan C. Lapp H. Alory C. Su A.I. Hogenesch J.B. Balch W.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3847-3864Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In fact, several lines of evidence indicate that Rab5 isoforms can be functionally different. First, Rab5A is found to be the only isoform transcriptionally up-regulated in response to treatment with cytokines like interleukin-4 or interferon-γ in macrophages (11Wainszelbaum M.J. Proctor B.M. Pontow S.E. Stahl P.D. Barbieri M.A. Exp. Cell Res. 2006; 312: 2238-2251Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 12Alvarez-Dominguez C. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33901-33904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Moreover, Rab5A but not Rab5C was found to be involved in the maturation of phagosomes containing Listeria monocytogenes (13Alvarez-Dominguez C. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11459-11462Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In primary hippocampal cultures, treatment with 3,5 dihydroxyphenylglycine, a group I metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist, leads to up-regulation of Rab5B but not Rab5A, thereby reducing N-methyl-d-aspartate-type glutamate receptor-mediated membrane current and cell death (14Arnett A.L. Bayazitov I. Blaabjerg M. Fang L. Zimmer J. Baskys A. Brain Res. 2004; 1028: 59-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 15Blaabjerg M. Baskys A. Zimmer J. Vawter M.P. Mol. Brain Res. 2003; 117: 196-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Also, Rab5 isoforms can be differentially phosphorylated at a consensus motif in position 123 by distinct proline-directed Ser/Thr kinases in vitro (16Chiariello M. Bruni C.B. Bucci C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).

Activated EGFR stimulates numerous signal transduction pathways that mediate a wide spectrum of cell responses, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis (17Ullrich A. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1990; 61: 203-212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4609) Google Scholar, 18Fischer O.M. Hart S. Gschwind A. Ullrich A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1203-1208Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To regulate the strength and duration of the signaling, activated EGFR also initiates a negative feedback mechanism that eventually leads to the removal of EGF-EGFR complexes from the plasma membrane by endocytosis (19Stoscheck C.M. Carpenter G. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 1048-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown that overexpression of Rab5A enhances EGF-stimulated fluid phase endocytosis and EGF-EGFR internalization, whereas dominant negative Rab5 represses these processes (20Barbieri M.A. Roberts R.L. Gumusboga A. Highfield H. Alvarez-Dominguez C. Wells A. Stahl P.D. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 539-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 21Dinneen J.L. Ceresa B.P. Exp.

Cell Res. 2004; 294: 509-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). On the other hand, continual expression of constitutively active Rab5 causes a ligand-independent redistribution of EGFR into the intracellular vesicles (22Dinneen J.L. Ceresa B.P.

In this study, we took advantage of the RNA interference silencing technique to individually knock down endogenous Rab5 isoforms in HeLa cells, so that we could examine the loss-of-function phenotypes more likely to capture their physiological activities. Our results indicate that suppression of Rab5A significantly impairs the degradation of EGFR, whereas Rab5C suppression has little effect. The delay of EGFR degradation elicited by the absence of Rab5A occurs after EGFR is internalized, because the rate of EGFR internalization is unaffected by suppression of a single isoform. In addition, we identified Rin1 (Ras interaction/interference 1), a Vps9 domain-containing Rab5 exchange factor, to preferentially associate Rab5A and selectively potentiate its activity in response to EGF stimulation.

A Rin1 expression construct was prepared by subcloning full-length human Rin1 PCR product into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1/V5-His TOPO TA (Invitrogen). The siRNAs against Rab5 isoforms were constructed and purified using the SilencerTM siRNA construction kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) as described. The sequences specific for human Rab5A are 5′- 84GAGTCCGCTGTTGGCAAATCA-3′ and 5′-623AACCAGGAATCAGTGTTGTAG-3′, for human Rab5B are 5′-174ACCCAGTCCGTTTGTCTAGAT-3′ and 5′-492AAGACAGCTATGAACGTGAAT-3′, for human Rab5C are 5′-309ACCAACACAGATACATTTGCA-3′ and 5′-503AATGAACGTGAACGAAATCTT-3′, and for human Rin1 are 5′-AACAGTCTGAGACAACTGCTG-3′ and 5′-AACATGTCCTGGAGAAGTCAT-3′. A scrambled siRNA (Ambion, Austin, TX) or siRNA designed against GFP was used as negative controls. The transfection of siRNA (final concentration, 20 nm) was performed using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. HeLa, HEK293T, and DU145 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% bovine growth serum (Hyclone Laboratories) containing penicillin and streptomycin. The transfection was performed using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Immunoblotting analysis was conducted as described before (1Kong C. Su X. Chen P.I. Stahl P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 15294-15301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cell lysates were prepared with the lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation prior to separation by SDS-PAGE. The resolved proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Whatman Schleicher & Schuell, Florham Park, NJ) and then blocked in TBST containing 5% nonfat milk. The membranes were probed with primary antibodies and then horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA), and the proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence detection reagents (Pierce). The immunoblot data were quantified by AlphaEaseFC 4.0 software (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA). For immunoprecipitation, the clarified cell lysates were incubated with primary antibodies and protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed extensively with lysis buffer and solubilized in SDS sample loading buffer. Control or experimental cells were serum-starved and then treated with 100 ng/ml EGF and 25 μg/ml cyclohexamide for different times. At the end of each time point, the cells were washed with PBS and then lysed in lysis buffer as indicated above. The lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with appropriate antibodies. Confluent HeLa cells pretreated with siRNA were starved in serum-free medium. One set of experiment was kept unstimulated, whereas the other two sets were stimulated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 2 and 5 min. The internalization was stopped by washing with ice-cold PBS-Ca-Mg (PBS, pH 7.4, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2). The chilled cells were then incubated with biotin labeling solution containing 0.5 mg/ml EZ-Link® Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) in PBS-Ca-Mg at 4 °C for 30 min. The reaction was quenched by washing the cells with ice-cold PBS-Ca-Mg containing 15 mm glycine. The cells were then washed again with PBS and lysed as described above. The biotinylated EGFRs were purified using MagnaBindTM streptavidin beads (Pierce) according to the product instructions. Precipitated biotin-EGFR then were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. The rate of internalization is calculated by densitometry of EGFR bands. His-Rab5A, B, and C recombinant proteins were purified from bacterial lysates. HeLa and DU145 cell lysates were prepared as described above. 5 or 10 μg of total proteins from DU145 or HeLa cells, respectively, were subjected to SDS-PAGE alongside purified recombinant Rab5 isoform standards. The intensity of the protein standard bands was quantified with AlphaEaseFc 4.0 software and plotted against their concentration predetermined with BCA assay to define the linear range of the signal. Band signals from cell lysates were then calculated to determine the ratio of different isoforms. Cells grown on coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscope Sciences), permeabilized, and then blocked with goat serum. Following incubation with primary antibodies and then Alexa Fluor 594- or 488-conjugated secondary antibodies, the coverslips were mounted with fluorescent mounting medium (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA). Confocal microscopy was performed using a 63× objective and fluorescein sets on a MRC1024 (Bio-Rad). Uptake of Alexa 488-labeled EGF or transferrin was performed by first starving cells in serum-free medium for 3 or 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then incubated with cold serum-free medium containing 400 ng/ml fluorescein EGF or 40 μg/ml transferrin for 1 h at 4 °C. Endocytosis were initiated by replacing the ligand binding medium with prewarmed medium. At the end of each time point, the cells were rapidly chilled, washed, fixed with paraformaldehyde, and then subjected to immunostaining as described above. cDNA of the Rab5-binding domain (R5BD, residues 739–862) of Rabaptin5-pGEX was a kind gift from Dr. Guangpu Li (University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center). The resulting construct termed pGEX/Rabaptin-5(R5BD) was expressed in DH5α. GFP-Rab5 isoforms were expressed in HeLa cells for 24 h. The cells were first starved and then treated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 5 min. The cells were subjected to lysis for 5 min in the lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitor). Aliquots of clarified lysates were incubated with GST-R5BD prebound to the glutathione-Sepharose-4B resin for 30 min at 4 °C on a rotating mixer. The resin was subsequently rinsed with the lysis buffer, resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and then subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. All of the experiments presented were repeated a minimum of three times. The data represent the means ± S.E. Student's t test was used to calculate statistical significance. To study the functional differences of endogenous Rab5 isoforms, we designed siRNAs to specifically silence individual isoforms. At least two independent siRNAs were used to suppress each isoform. Immunoblotting with isoform-specific antibodies confirmed that the suppression was more than 90% from each siRNA, and the isoform-specific siRNAs did not cross-react with other isoforms, because the levels of the other two isoforms were unaffected when one isoform was silenced (Fig. 1A). Following siRNA treatment, HeLa cells were assayed for EGFR levels at steady state. We found that cells depleted of Rab5A or 5B consistently exhibited increased level of total EGFR, whereas the loss of Rab5C showed very few effects (Fig. 1A). The accumulation of EGFR in cells depleted of Rab5A or 5B suggests that the sorting of EGFR into degradation pathway is likely interrupted. Therefore, we examined the rate of EGFR degradation by stimulating HeLa cells with EGF for different times. The levels of EGFR at early time points (3 and 8 min) were not used for quantitative analysis, because we found that the immunoblot signals of EGFR were highly variable among experiments at these time points. The results (collected from 15, 30, and 60 min) showed that in HeLa cells, the initial rate of degradation was substantially reduced in Rab5A- or Rab5B-depleted cells; however, between 45 and 60 min, the receptors eventually underwent degradation to an extent similar to the control cells (Fig. 1, B and C, and supplemental Fig. S1). The degree of delay is more profound with Rab5A depletion than with Rab5B knockdowns. Of all three Rab5 isoforms, Rab5C suppression seems to have the least impact. This result suggests that the degradation of EGFR requires both Rab5A and 5B. It is possible that the two isoforms work in concert or sequence along the degradation pathway, so that only one of the two isoforms present is not sufficient to transport EGFR at normal rates. We also tested the rate of EGFR degradation in DU145 cells. DU145 is a prostate cancer cell line expressing EGFR at much higher level than HeLa cells. In agreement with what we found in HeLa cells, the depletion of Rab5A also leads to more delayed EGFR degradation in DU145 cells (Fig. 1D). This finding not only verified that the function of endogenous Rab5 is critical for sorting EGFR into degradation pathway but also provided new evidence indicating a preferential connection between endogenous Rab5A and the trafficking of EGFR. Previously, Bucci and co-workers (16Chiariello M. Bruni C.B. Bucci C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 20-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) reported that HeLa cells express all three Rab5 isoforms with Rab5B to be more enriched than the other two. To test the possibility that the differential delay of EGFR trafficking caused by individual Rab5 isoform silencing corresponds to the relative isoform abundance, we examined the concentration of Rab5 isoforms in HeLa and DU145 cells using purified recombinant Rab5 isoform proteins as standards. Whole cell lysates from HeLa or DU145 cells were analyzed alongside Rab5 protein standards during SDS-PAGE. Following protein gel transfer, the membranes were probed with isoform-specific antibodies, and the intensity of the bands from protein standards was plotted against its concentration to demonstrate the linearity of the band signals (supplemental Fig. S2) and the avidity of the isoform-specific antibodies. Using this method, we were able to estimate that the ratio of endogenous Rab5A:Rab5B:Rab5C was ∼1:1:2 in HeLa cells and 2:3:1 in DU145 cells (Fig. 2). These data show that Rab5A is not the most abundant isoform in either cell line, yet it dominates the endocytic trafficking of EGFR. We next tested whether overexpression of individual Rab5 isoforms has opposite effects on EGFR degradation. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with individual CFP-Rab5 isoforms overnight and EGFR degradation assays were carried out as described above. Our findings indicate that exogenously expressed Rab5A, but neither 5B nor 5C accelerated the degradation of EGFR in HeLa cells (Fig. 3, A and B). In accordance with the biochemical analysis, immunostaining of total EGFR in cells transfected with RFP-Rab5 isoforms revealed that Rab5A-expressing cells have weaker EGFR signals, suggesting enhanced down-regulation (Fig. 3C and supplemental Fig. S3). We did, however, notice that the degree of acceleration was relatively mild (Fig. 3, A and B). Because the transfection efficiency of Rab5 isoform constructs generally does not exceed 80% in HeLa cells, it is possible that the acceleration of EGFR degradation is masked by untransfected cells. Alternatively, we reasoned that under our experimental conditions, endogenous Rab5 isoforms may have already maximized the rate of trafficking and sequestered the limiting factors participating in this process; therefore, excess Rab5 could not improve the transport much further. On the other hand, the finding with Rab5A expression did coincide with the outcome of its depletion, implicating Rab5A as the primary Rab5 isoform in the EGFR degradation pathway. Next, to identify the sites where Rab5A and/or 5B are most active, we examined whether loss of individual isoforms could interfere the internalization of EGFR. Control or Rab5 isoform siRNAs-treated HeLa cells were starved and then stimulated with EGF for the indicated times (Fig. 4, A and B). EGFR remaining on the cell surface was biotin-labeled, precipitated by streptavidin beads, and analyzed with immunoblotting. The data show that depletion of individual Rab5 isoforms did not inhibit the internalization of EGFR, whereas simultaneous depletion of all three isoforms delayed the internalization by ∼50% (Fig. 4, A and B). Similar results have been reported previously with 125I-EGF based assay by Sorkin and co-workers (24Huang F. Khvorova A. Marshall W. Sorkin A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16657-16661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Similar to EGFR, the endocytosis of transferrin (Tfn) receptors was not altered by silencing of individual Rab5 isoforms, whereas silencing all three isoforms together showed marked reduction of Tfn uptake (Fig. 4C and supplemental Fig. S4). These data suggest that Rab5 isoforms, although actively participating in the internalization step of receptor trafficking, are functionally redundant at this stage. After internalization, EGFR sorting into the late endosome and degradation in the lysosome are necessary to terminate receptor signaling. c-Cbl-mediated ubiquitylation has been shown to be essential for regulating these events and ensuring proper degradation of EGFR (25Longva K.E. Blystad F.D. Stang E. Larsen A.M. Johannessen L.E. Madshus I.H. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 843-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 26Levkowitz G. Waterman H. Ettenberg S.A. Katz M.

Upon EGF stimulation, c-Cbl binds directly to the EGFR via Tyr-1045 and indirectly through the Src homology 3 domain of Grb2, whose recruitment to the EGFR is mediated by phosphorylation at Tyr-1068 and Tyr-1086 of EGFR (27Grøvdal L.M. Stang E. Sorkin A. Madshus I.H. Exp. Cell Res. 2004; 300: 388-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 28Jiang X. Huang F. Marusyk A. Sorkin A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 858-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether the delayed degradaton of EGFR as a result of Rab5A or 5B depletion correlates with altered EGFR phosphorylation and ubiquitylation. By immunoprecipitating EGFR after stimulation for different periods of time and probing ubiquitylated EGFR with anti-ubiquitin antibody, we found that the relative levels of EGFR ubiquitylation over time is not altered by depletion of Rab5A or 5B (Fig. 5A). Consistently, depletion of Rab5A or 5B did not suppress the phosphorylation of EGFR at Tyr-1045 or Tyr-1068 (Fig. 5B and supplemental Fig. S5), nor did the silencing of Rab5 isoforms interfere with the recruitment of c-Cbl or Grb2. However, it is unclear whether depletion of Rab5A or 5B alters the phosphorylation of other tyrosine or serine sites of the EGFR and/or obstructs its access to other key adaptors. Further studies will be needed to reveal a more detailed phosphorylation map of EGFR in response to Rab5 isoform silencing. To further investigate how the loss of individual isoforms changes endosomal dynamics, we examined the subcellular distribution of EEA1, a FYVE domain-containing protein known to associate with the early endosomal compartment (4Christoforidis S.

Brech A. Mehlum A. Stenmark H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 435-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). In the mean time, the transport of EGFR was visualized by either indirect EGFR immunostaining or by using Alexa 488-labeled EGF. Consistent with the immunoblotting data, we observed stronger EGF (or EGFR) signals in Rab5A or 5B-depleted cells (Fig. 6). The association of EEA1 with membrane structures was not impaired by loss of individual Rab5 isoforms, nor was the distribution of Hrs and CD63, a late endosomal marker (Fig. 6 and supplemental Fig. S6). Similar to control cells, the EGF-EGFR complex in isoform-silenced cells entered EEA1-positive compartments within 10 min (Fig. 6A). At later time points, most E"

Here we discuss the effects of control on a socially complex top-order predator, the dingo (Canis lupus dingo). Since European occupation of Australia, dingoes have been controlled over much of the continent. Our aim was to investigate the effects of control on their abundance and social stability. We hypothesized that dingo abundance and social stability are not linearly related, and proposed a theoretical model in which dingo populations may fluctuate between three main states: (A) below carrying capacity and socially fractured, (B) above carrying capacity and socially fractured, or (C) at carrying capacity and socially stable. We predicted that lethal control would drive dingoes into the unstable states A or B, and that relaxation of control would allow recovery towards C. We tested our predictions by surveying relative abundance (track density) and indicators of social stability (scent-marking and howling) at seven sites in the arid zone subject to differing degrees of control. We also monitored changes in dingo abundance and social stability following relaxation and intensification of control. Sites where dingoes had been controlled within the previous two years were characterized by low scent-marking activity, but abundance was similar at sites with and without control. Signs of social stability steadily increased the longer an area was allowed to recover from control, but change in abundance did not follow a consistent path. Comparison of abundance and stability among all sites and years demonstrated that control severely fractures social groups, but that the effect of control on abundance was neither consistent nor predictable. Management decisions involving large social predators must therefore consider social stability to ensure their conservation and ecological functioning."

https://openalex.org/W2033942923,"WHO estimates that only 3% of fever patients use recommended artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), partly reflecting their high prices in the retail sector from where many patients seek treatment. To overcome this challenge, a global ACT subsidy has been proposed. We tested this proposal through a pilot program in rural Tanzania.Three districts were assigned to serve either as a control or to receive the subsidy plus a package of supporting interventions. From October 2007, ACTs were sold at a 90% subsidy through the normal private supply chain to intervention district drug shops. Data were collected at baseline and during intervention using interviews with drug shop customers, retail audits, mystery shoppers, and audits of public and NGO facilities. The proportion of consumers in the intervention districts purchasing ACTs rose from 1% at baseline to 44.2% one year later (p<0.001), and was significantly higher among consumers purchasing for children under 5 than for adults (p = 0.005). No change in ACT usage was observed in the control district. Consumers paid a mean price of $0.58 for ACTs, which did not differ significantly from the price paid for sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine, the most common alternative. Drug shops in population centers were significantly more likely to stock ACTs than those in more remote areas (p<0.001).A subsidy introduced at the top of the private sector supply chain can significantly increase usage of ACTs and reduce their retail price to the level of common monotherapies. Additional interventions may be needed to ensure access to ACTs in remote areas and for poorer individuals who appear to seek treatment at drug shops less frequently.Controlled-Trials.com ISRCTN39125414."

Here, we show that the pan-histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor ITF2357, a compound shown to be safe and effective in humans, improves functional recovery and attenuates tissue damage when administered as late as 24 h postinjury. Using a well-characterized, clinically relevant mouse model of closed head injury (CHI), we demonstrate that a single dose of ITF2357 administered 24 h postinjury improves neurobehavioral recovery from d 6 up to 14 d postinjury (improved neurological score vs. vehicle; P< or =0.05), and that this functional benefit is accompanied by decreased neuronal degeneration, reduced lesion volume (22% reduction vs. vehicle; P< or =0.01), and is preceded by increased acetylated histone H3 levels and attenuation of injury-induced decreases in cytoprotective heat-shock protein 70 kDa and phosphorylated Akt. Moreover, reduced glial accumulation and activation were observed 3 d postinjury, and total p53 levels at the area of injury and caspase-3 immunoreactivity within microglia/macrophages at the trauma area were elevated, suggesting enhanced clearance of these cells via apoptosis following treatment. Hence, our findings underscore the relevance of HDAC inhibitors for ameliorating trauma-induced functional deficits and warrant consideration of applying ITF2357 for this indication."

In the stomach, Slc26a7 co-localizes with AE2, a major Cl−/HCO3− exchanger, on the basolateral membrane of acid secreting parietal cells (28Petrovic S. Ju X. Barone S. Seidler U. Alper S.L. Lohi H.

To address the physiological function of Slc26a7 in the intact mouse, we have generated Slc26a7 ko mice. We report here that Slc26a7 ko mice exhibit distal renal tubular acidosis and impaired gastric acidification in the absence of morphological abnormalities in kidney or stomach. Our strategy was to delete the Slc26a7 gene by knocking out exons 3 and 4, which encode 168 amino acid residues. Toward this end, a ∼15.6-kb fragment was subcloned from the BAC-encoding part of the Slc26a7 gene for generation of a targeting construct. The construct was designed with the short homology arm (SA) extending ∼2.0-kb 5′ to exon 3, and with the long homology arm (LA) extending 8.3 kb 3′ beyond the 3′-end of exon 4. The Neo cassette replaces 4.2 kb of the gene including exons 3 and 4. Each modification step in construction of the targeting vector was confirmed by restriction analysis and by sequencing using primers designed to read from the selection cassette into the LA and the SA. T7 and P6 primers anneal to the vector sequence and read into the 5′- and 3′-ends of the BAC subclone. The schematic diagram in Fig. 1A depicts the targeting construct used to generate the Slc26a7 ko mouse, with location of the Neo cassette indicated. 10 μg of the targeting vector were linearized by AscI and used to transfect 129/SV embryonic stem cells by electroporation. After selection in G418, surviving clones were expanded for PCR analysis to identify recombinant ES clones. Primers A1, 2, and 3 were designed downstream (3′) to the short homology arm (SA) outside the region used to generate the targeting construct (Fig. 1B). PCR reactions using A1, 2, or 3 with the N1 primer at the 5′-end of the Neo cassette amplify 2.15, 2.18, and 2.25 kb fragments, respectively. The control PCR reaction was performed using AT1 and AT2, which is at the 5′-end of the SA inside the region used to create the targeting construct. This amplifies a band of 1.6 kb. The oligo sequences used to screen the ES clones were as follows: A1: 5′-attccctggaacttcagttcc-3′; A2: 5′-actctgattagtgcattcctc-3′. A3: 5′-ttggac acagccattcatgcctg-3′; AT1: 5′-aggaccaggaagttctctcag-3′. AT2: 5′-gcatggcaatctctgagttcagtc-3′; N1: 5′-tgcga ggccagagg ccacttgtgtagc-3′. Individual clones were screened with A2/N1 primers. Fig. 1C is a PCR analysis of DNA isolated from ES cells after electroporation with the targeting construct and selection with G418. More than 400 surviving colonies were screened. As shown in Fig. 1C, at least two clones (clones 164 and 222) were identified as having undergone homologous recombination. The positive control amplifications using primers A2/AT2, AT1/AT2, and AT1/N1 gave the expected fragment sizes of 1.1, 0.8, and 1.8 kb, respectively. The homologous recombination events in clones 164 and 222 were further validated by Southern blot (data not shown). ES cells from clones 164 or 222 were microinjected into C57BL/6J blastocysts. Chimeric mice were bred to obtain wild-type (Slc26a7+/+) and heterozygous (Slc26a7+/−) mice (Fig. 1D). Intercrossing of Slc26a7 heterozygotes (+/−) generated Slc26a7 ko mice. Tail DNA genotyping was performed using the A2/N1 primer set (see above). Northern hybridization demonstrated the complete absence of Slc26a7 mRNA in stomach and kidney of Slc26a7-null mice (Fig. 1E). Immunofluorescence labeling in kidney and stomach verified the absence of Slc26a7 in −/− mice (data not shown). Slc26a7-null mice are healthy and have normal blood pressure. Mice were cared for in accordance with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the University of Cincinnati and the Medical School of Hannover University. All animal handlers were IACUC-trained. Animals had access to food and water ad libitum, were housed in humidity, temperature and light/dark-controlled rooms, and were inspected daily. Animals were euthanized with the use of either anesthetics (pentobarbital sodium) or cervical dislocation after carbon dioxide narcosis according to institutional guidelines and approved protocols. Kidneys from wild-type and Slc26a7-null mice were decapsulated, sectioned into three to four cross sections per kidney, and immediately placed in a Petri dish containing dissecting solution. Each section was stripped from the papillary tip to the cortex into smaller wedges and transferred into a second Petri dish containing dissecting solution maintained at 14 °C under a dissecting microscope (Nikon SMZ-645). Segments of OMCD were dissected and microperfused as before (3Weiner I.D. Wingo C.S. Hamm L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F406-F415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Schwartz G.J. Satlin L.M. Bergmann J.E. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F1003-F1014PubMed Google Scholar). The perfusate and bath superfusate were equilibrated with solutions containing 95% O2-5% CO2. After equilibration, the tubule was luminally perfused for 5 min with 5 μm of the pH-sensitive dye BCECF-AM, leading to uptake of dye by intercalated cells only, and not by principal cells (39Silver R.B. Soleimani M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F799-F811PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescent measurements were done with ratio digital imaging system using an inverted fluorescence microscope (Nikon TE-300). Excitation wavelengths were recorded at 490 and 440 nm, and emission was measured at 520 nm. Only one tubule per animal was examined, with the visual field including two to four cells per tubule. Intracellular calibration was performed by using the high-K+-nigericin method (3Weiner I.D. Wingo C.S. Hamm L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F406-F415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Schwartz G.J.

Basolateral Cl−/HCO3− exchanger activity in Type A-ICs was assessed as the rate of pHi change, as well as the amplitude of pHi response when the bath perfusate was switched to a Cl−-free solution. This maneuver causes cell alkalinization in Type A-ICs via reversal of the basolateral Cl−/HCO3− exchanger. Following pHi stabilization in Cl-free medium, the bath perfusate was switched back to a Cl−-containing solution, resulting in recovery of pHi to baseline levels via Cl−/HCO3− exchange (3Weiner I.D. Wingo C.S. Hamm L.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: F406-F415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Schwartz G.J. Satlin L.M. Bergmann J.E. Am. J.

The experimental maneuvers were similar to those published, with modifications as described (10Xu J. Song P. Miller M.L. Borgese F. Barone S. Riederer B. Wang Z. Alper S.L. Forte J.G. Shull G.E.

Briefly, the mucosal layer was dissected from mouse gastric corpus under a stereomicroscope and mounted between two Lucite half chambers of a water-jacketed Ussing system equipped with a gas-lift system. The exposed surface area was 0.283 cm2. The serosal solution contained (in mm) 108 NaCl, 22 NaHCO3, 3 KCl, 1.3 MgSO4, 2 CaCl2, 2.25 KH2PO4, 8.9 glucose, and 10 sodium pyruvate and was gassed with 95% O2-5% CO2, pH 7.4. The chamber was allowed to equilibrate for at least 30 min in the presence of indomethacin (3 × 10−5 m) and tetrodotoxin 10−6 m) added to the serosal solution to minimize the impact of intrinsic prostanoid and neural tone. The mucosal solution (154 mm NaCl) was gassed with 100% O2 and maintained at pH 7.4 by the controlled addition of dilute (2 mm) NaOH (in 0.1-μl volume) using a pH-Stat titration system (Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark). If the stomach showed acid secretion, basal parameters were measured for 30 min; and, after addition of 10−5 m forskolin to serosal solution, a maneuver known to stimulate acid secretion. Acid secretory rates were recorded for 60 min at 5-min intervals. Data represent means ± S.E. The Neo cassette replaces 4.0 kb of the gene including exons 3 and 4 (Fig. 1, A and B, “Experimental Procedures”). Targeted ES cells (Fig. 1C) were used to generate chimeric mice that were bred to obtain wild-type (Slc26a7+/+), heterozygous (Slc26a7+/−), and null (Slc26a7−/−) mice (Fig. 1D). The expression of Slc26a7 was completely abrogated in the kidney and stomach of Slc26a7-null mice (Fig. 1E). Slc26a7−/− mice exhibited normal growth, blood pressure, and survival relative to wild-type littermates. Arterial blood gas analysis and blood chemistry examination demonstrated a significant reduction in arterial pH and serum bicarbonate, consistent with metabolic acidosis (Fig. 2, A and B, n = 13 in each group). Slc26a7 ko mice have elevated urine pH (Fig. 2C), despite severe metabolic acidosis (Fig. 2, A and B). The presence of metabolic acidosis, along with an inappropriately alkaline urine pH, is indicative of distal renal tubular acidosis in Slc26a7 ko mice. Urine output was 2.01 ± 0.2 and 1.92 ± 0.2 ml/24 h in Slc26a7+/+ and Slc26a7−/− mice, respectively (p > 0.05, n = 5 in each group). Urine osmolarity was 2489 ± 180 and 2710 ± 150 mosm/liter in Slc26a7+/+ and Slc26a7−/− mice, respectively (p > 0.05, n = 5 in each group). When challenged with an acid load in the form of NH4Cl (at 280 mm) added to their drinking water for seven days, Slc26a7+/+ and Slc26a7−/− mice dropped their serum bicarbonate to 21 ± 1 and 15.5 ± 1 mEq/liter, respectively (p < 0.01, n = 5). Urine pH was ∼5.5 and 6.5 in Slc26a7+/+ and Slc26a7−/− mice, respectively, following challenge with the acid load (p < 0.05). These results demonstrate a more profound drop in serum bicarbonate (∼4.5 mEq/liter versus 1.7 mEq/liter, p < 0.05, n = 5) and the inability to acidify urine pH (6.5 versus 5.5, p < 0.05) in response to acid load in Slc26a7 ko mice. Taken together, these results are consistent with distal renal tubular acidosis in Slc26a7-null mice. Given the localization of Slc26a7, we next examined the functional activity of the basolateral chloride/bicarbonate (Cl−/HCO3−) exchanger in acid-secreting cells in the OMCD. Toward this end, intracellular pH in A-intercalated cells was measured by the pH-sensitive dye (BCECF) in microperfused kidney outer medullary collecting duct (OMCD). Fig. 3A depicts a microperfused mouse kidney OMCD. The acid-secreting (A) intercalated cells are delineated by bright color, which reflects the uptake of BCECF, as principal cells do not take up the dye in significant amount. Fig. 3B (left) is a representative pHi tracing in Slc26a7+/+ mouse OMCD and performed in isotonic solutions (290 mosM) in the perfusate and bath. As indicated, there is a significant intracellular alkalinization in response to the removal of bath chloride in microperfused OMCD, which is significantly diminished in the presence of 10 μm DIDS (Fig. 3B, left). Fig. 3B (right) depicts pHi tracing in Slc26a7−/− mouse OMCD and indicates the presence of a significant DIDS-sensitive intracellular alkalinization in response to the removal of bath chloride in microperfused OMCD. Fig. 3C (left) is a representative pHi tracing in Slc26a7+/+ mouse OMCD and performed in hypertonic (440 mosm) perfusate and bath (mannitol was used to make the solutions hypertonic). As indicated, there is a significant intracellular alkalinization in response to the removal of bath chloride in microperfused OMCD cells, which is not significantly affected by 10 μm DIDS (Fig. 3C, left). The rate of the intracellular alkalinization in hypertonic solution is significantly diminished in Slc26a7−/− mice (Fig. 3C, left versus right panel). In all experiments that were performed in either isotonic or hypertonic medium, EIPA at 10 μmol was added to the bath to prevent NHE1 activation and potassium was removed from the luminal fluid and concanamycin A at 100 nm added to the lumen to inactivate H-K-ATPase and H+-ATPase, respectively. The baseline pHi was significantly elevated in hypertonic medium in Slc26a7−/− mice (pHi 7.26) versus Slc26a7+/+ animals (pHi 7.11) (Fig. 3C). The results of five separate experiments from different animals demonstrated that the rate of basolateral Cl−/HCO3− exchange was decreased by only ∼18% in Slc26a7−/− in isotonic medium (p < 0.05) but decreased by >70% in hypertonic medium relative to Slc26a7+/+ mice (p < 0.01) (Fig. 3D). Whether the set point for other basolateral acid base transporters is changed in hypertonic medium in Slc26a7 ko mice cannot be excluded. The osmotically tolerant cultured kidney (MDCK) cells were transiently transfected with the epitope-tagged Slc26a7 (referred to GFP-Slc26a7) and switched to a hypertonic medium (440 mm) overnight to mimic the in vivo milieu in the medulla. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were either switched to an isotonic medium or remained in hypertonic medium for an additional 60 min. Cells were then fixed and processed for image analysis under confocal microscopy. The results as demonstrated in Fig. 4, top panel indicate that reducing the osmolarity of the medium from hypertonic (440 mm) to isotonic (290 mm) for 60 min, which mimics the changes in microperfused OMCD (Fig. 3), causes significant reduction in membrane abundance of Slc26a7 (Fig. 4, top panel, column C) relative to cells that stay in hypertonic medium, which demonstrate a predominant membrane expression pattern (Fig. 4, top panel, column B). The Z-line (side view) images of confocal pictures demonstrate that the membrane abundance of Slc26a7 is indeed decreased in cells switched to isotonic medium (Fig. 4, top panel, lower frame of column C relative to column B). The epitope-tagged Slc26a7 was predominantly detected in the cytoplasm in cells transfected and grown in isotonic medium (Fig. 4, top panel, column A). The GFP alone (no Slc26a7 insert) was localized intracellularly in both isotonic and hypertonic medium (Fig. 4, top panel, columns D and E). The membrane abundance of epitope-tagged AE1 did not change in isotonic medium (data not shown). To reduce medullary osmolarity, animals were subjected to water loading according to established protocols. Briefly, the control group was allowed tap water ad libitum; whereas, the water-loaded animals were induced to drink water abundantly by adding glucose (50 g/1000 ml) to their drinking water. This maneuver has been shown to increase water intake, decrease urine osmolarity and increase urine output, all indicators of decreasing medullary interstitial osmotic gradient. Our in vivo studies confirmed the in vitro findings in Fig. 4, top panel, by demonstrating that decreasing the tonicity of the kidney medulla by water loading reduced the membrane abundance of Slc26a7 in A-intercalated cells in the OMCD (Fig. 4, bottom panel, section B). Interestingly, the abundance of AE1 was not significantly affected in water loading (Fig. 4, bottom panel, section B). To ascertain the role of Slc26a7 in gastric acid secretion, stomach pH and amount of acid in gastric secretions from Slc26a7+/+ and Slc26a7−/− mice were examined following stimulation of acid secretion with histamine. The pH of gastric secretions was not significantly different in Slc26a7−/− mice, with values of 4.2 ± 0.4 in Slc26a7−/− mice versus 3.5 ± 0.4 in Slc26a7+/+ (Fig. 5A, p > 0.05). Quantitation of gastric acid revealed acid secretion to be significantly decreased in Slc26a7−/− mice (75 ± 6 mEq/g wet weight in Slc26a9+/+ and 46 ± 4 in Slc26a7−/− mice) (Fig. 5B, p < 0.01). To quantify actual rates of HCl secretion, isolated gastric mucosae from Slc26a7+/+ and Slc26a7−/− mice were studied in modified Ussing-chamber systems. The gastric mucosa from Slc26a7−/− mice 40–45 days of age showed significant impairment in forskolin-stimulated acid secretion compared with that of wt mice (Fig. 5C, left and right panels; summarized in Fig. 5D). Our studies in osmotically tolerant cultured kidney (MDCK) cells demonstrate that reducing the osmolarity of the medium from hypertonic (440 mm) to isotonic (290 mm) for 60 min, which mimics the changes in perfused OMCD (Fig. 2), causes significant endocytosis of Slc26a7 from the membrane to the cytoplasm (Fig. 4, top panel). These results are in agreement with our previously published reports demonstrating that the membrane abundance of Slc26a7 in significantly increased in hypertonic medium by increasing its trafficking from the cytosolic pool (35Barone S.

Amlal H. Soleimani M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 956-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The membrane abundance of epitope-tagged AE1 was not affected by changes in the medium tonicity of medulla. 3J. Xu and M. Soleimani, unpublished data. Our in vivo studies confirmed the in vitro findings by demonstrating that decreasing the tonicity of kidney medulla by water loading reduced the membrane expression of Slc26a7 but had no significant effect on the abundance of AE1 in the basolateral membrane of A-intercalated cells in the OMCD (Fig. 4, bottom panel, section B). The expression pattern of Slc26a7 and AE1 in control state is shown for comparison (Fig. 4, bottom panel, section A). Further, increasing the osmolarity of the medulla by water deprivation was associated with the increased abundance of Slc26a7 and decreased abundance of AE1 in the plasma membrane of A-intercalated cells in OMCD (36Xu J. Worrell R.T. Li H.C. Barone S.L. Petrovic S. Amlal H. Soleimani M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 956-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies indicate that Slc26a7 is the dominant bicarbonate-extruding transporter in the OMCD in hypertonic medium; whereas, AE1 is more active in isotonic environment. Northern hybridization and immunohistochemistry studies indicated enhanced expression of AE1 in the OMCD of Slc26a7-null mice (supplemental Fig. 2). The expression of pendrin, the apical Cl−/HCO3− exchanger in B-intercalated cells, was significantly decreased in Slc26a7-null mice (supplemental Fig. 2). Mutations in AE1 have been shown to be associated with distal renal tubular acidosis, as manifested by metabolic acidosis and renal bicarbonate wasting (4Karet F.E. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2002; 13: 2178-2184Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).

Systemic deletion of AE1 in mouse is associated with severe spherocytic hemolytic anemia and early lethality, in some cases due to widespread thrombosis (40Hassoun H. Wang Y. Vassiliadis J.

The examination of the kidney defect in systemic AE-1 ko mice is therefore complicated by the presence of concurrent severe systemic perturbations that can impact the kidney medulla and indirectly affect the activity of ion transporters. However, surviving AE-1-null mice exhibit only a 25% reduction in Cl−/HCO3− exchanger activity in Type A-intercalated cells of the OMCD (41Stehberger P.A. Shmukler B.E. Stuart-Tilley A.K. Peters L.L.

Slc26a7 ko mice displayed reduced gastric acid secretion (Fig. 5). Functional studies in cultured cells or oocytes demonstrated that Slc26a7 can function as a chloride channel, as well as a Cl−/HCO3− exchanger (28Petrovic S. Ju X. Barone S. Seidler U. Alper S.L.

Novartis Found Symp. 2006; 273: 126-138Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a Cl−/HCO3− exchanger, Slc26a7 can facilitate the extrusion of bicarbonate across the basolateral membrane, which should enhance the generation of intracellular acid for secretion into the stomach lumen via apical H-K-ATPase. As a chloride channel, Slc26a7 can contribute to the transport of chloride from blood into parietal cells for eventual secretion across the apical membrane along with the acid (H+). In either mode, Slc26a7 has the potential to regulate gastric acid secretion, albeit via different mechanisms. Whether the main functional mode of Slc26a7 in gastric parietal cells is the mediation of Cl−/HCO3− exchange or chloride channel remains speculative. Our studies in isolated gastric mucosa mounted on Ussing chamber (Fig. 5) do not distinguish between the two possible functional modes of Slc26a7. Slc26a7 co-localizes with AE2 (Slc4a2), a known Cl−/HCO3− exchanger, on the basolateral membrane of gastric parietal cells (28Petrovic S. Ju X. Barone S. Seidler U. Alper S.L. Lohi H. Kere J.

Ultrastructural analysis of AE2−/− gastric mucosa indicated loss of secretory canaliculi and tubulovesicles (13Gawenis L.R. Ledoussal C. Judd L.M. Prasad V. Alper S.L. Stuart-Tilley A. Woo A.L.

These results demonstrate that AE2 is essential for maintaining the viability or development of parietal cells and for normal abundance of secretory canalicular and tubulovesicular membranes in mouse parietal cells. Whether the achlorhydria in AE2-null mice is partly due to the down-regulation of Slc26a7 needs further investigation. We did not observe any detectable alteration in the expression of AE2 on the basolateral membrane of gastric parietal cells in Slc26a7-null mice (supplemental Fig. 3). Stomach and kidney histology in Slc26a7−/− did not differ from those of Slc26a7+/+ mice (supplemental Fig. 4). In conclusion, genetic deletion of Slc26a7 in the mouse results in distal renal tubular acidosis and decreased gastric acid secretion. Deletion of Slc26a7 decreased basolateral Cl−/HCO3− exchanger activity in the acid-secreting cells in OMCD and resulted in renal bicarbonate wasting with subsequent metabolic acidosis. In the stomach, deletion of Slc26a7 reduced gastric acid secretion either due to impaired ability to extrude bicarbonate across the basolateral membrane or secondary to reduced chloride entry in the parietal cell. The schematic diagrams in Fig. 6 depict the role of Slc26a7 in acid secretion in the kidney outer medullary collecting duct and stomach. In the kidney (Fig. 6A), Slc26a7 functions predominantly as a Cl−/HCO3− exchanger that is active in hypertonic milieu. AE1, on the other hand, is a Cl−/HCO3− exchanger that is predominantly functional in isotonic or hypotonic environment. The expression of AE1 in OMCD increased in Slc26a7 ko mice (supplemental material). Whether this adaptation is secondary to acidosis or indicates a closer interaction between Slc26a7 and AE1 remains to be determined. Whether the role of Slc26a7 in acid secretion in the stomach is via increased bicarbonate extrusion across the basolateral membrane or enhanced entry of chloride in parietal cells via chloride conductance (Fig. 6B, left and right panels) remains speculative at the present. The expression of AE2 remained unchanged in gastric parietal cells in Slc26a7. Whether AE2 and Slc26a7 show differential regulation under different signaling pathways remains speculative at the present. We propose that SLC26A7 dysfunction should be investigated as a potential cause of unexplained distal renal tubular acidosis or decreased acid secretion in the stomach in humans.

E., and Penning, T. M. (2000) Cancer Res. 60, 908–915). They induce oxidative DNA lesions (reactive oxygen species-mediated DNA strand breaks and 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-oxo-dGuo) formation) in human lung cells. We tested whether the AhR enhances PAH o-quinone-mediated oxidative DNA damage by translocating these ligands to the nucleus. Using the single cell gel electrophoresis (comet) assay to detect DNA strand breaks in murine hepatoma Hepa1c1c7 cells and its AhR- and aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-deficient variants, benzo[a]pyrene-7,8-dione (B[a]P-7,8-dione) produced fewer DNA strand breaks in AhR-deficient cells compared with aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-deficient and wild type Hepa1c1c7 cells. Decreased DNA strand breaks were also observed in human bronchoalveolar H358 cells in which the AhR was silenced by siRNA. The antioxidant α-tocopherol and the iron chelator/antioxidant desferal decreased the formation of B[a]P-7,8-dione-mediated DNA strand breaks indicating that they were reactive oxygen species-dependent. By coupling the comet assay to 8-oxoguanine glycosylase (hOGG1), which excises 8-oxo-Gua, strand breaks dependent upon this lesion were measured. hOGG1 treatment produced more DNA single strand breaks in B[a]P-7,8-dione-treated Hepa cells and H358 cells than in its absence. The levels of hOGG1-dependent DNA strand breaks mediated by B[a]P-7,8-dione were lower in AhR-deficient Hepa and AhR knockdown H358 cells. The AhR antagonist α-naphthoflavone also attenuated B[a]P-7,8-dione-mediated DNA strand breaks. The decrease in 8-oxo-dGuo levels in AhR-deficient Hepa cells and AhR knockdown H358 cells was validated by immunoaffinity capture stable isotope dilution ([15N5]8-oxo-dGuo) liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization/multiple reaction monitoring/mass spectrometry.

Science. 1996; 274: 430-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). The G to T transversions most often observed in these genes might arise because of the action of one or more trans-lesional by-pass DNA polymerases that read through stable diol-epoxide DNA adducts with low processivity and fidelity (13Shibutani S. Margulis L.A. Geacintov N.E. Grollman A.P. Biochemistry,. 1993; 32: 7531-7541Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 14Xie Z. Braithwaite E. Guo D. Zhao B. Geacintov N.E. Wang Z.

As an alternative, human aldo-keto reductases (AKR1A1 and AKR1C1-AKR1C4) catalyze the NADP+-dependent oxidation of (±)B[a]P-7,8-trans-dihydrodiol to produce the electrophilic and redox-active B[a]P-7,8-dione (15Palackal N.T.

Chem. 2002; 277: 24799-24808Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). In this pathway, AKRs convert B[a]P-7,8-trans-dihydrodiol to form a ketol that rearranges to a catechol. The catechol then undergoes two subsequent one-electron oxidations to yield the fully oxidized o-quinone. Once formed, B[a]P-7,8-dione amplifies reactive oxygen species (ROS) by entering futile redox cycles that deplete cellular reducing equivalents (e.g. NADPH) (17Penning T.M. Burczynski M.E. Hung C.F.

PAH o-quinones can undergo 1,4- or 1,6-Michael addition with guanine and adenine bases to form stable N2-dGuo and N6-dAdo adducts in vitro (18Shou M. Harvey R.G. Penning T.M.

Penning T.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 1999; 12: 237-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). It is possible that these covalent PAH o-quinone adducts could give to G to T transversion mutations. PAH o-quinones also cause oxidative DNA damage in vitro and in vivo (22Ohnishi S. Kawanishi S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 290: 778-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 23Seike K.

Nanomolar concentrations of PAH o-quinones under redox cycling conditions (NADPH and Cu(II)) lead to significant 8-oxo-dGuo formation in bulk DNA, and the responsible oxidant was found to be singlet oxygen (1O2) (24Park J.H. Gopishetty S. Szewczuk L.M. Troxel A.B. Harvey R.G. Penning T.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2005; 18: 1026-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 26Park J.H. Troxel A.B. Harvey R.G. Penning T.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2006; 19: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, PAH o-quinones produced 8-oxo-dGuo as the most dominant lesion among the three types of oxidative lesions measured (abasic sites, 8-oxo-dGuo, and oxidized pyrimidines) (26Park J.H. Troxel A.B. Harvey R.G. Penning T.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2006; 19: 719-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In a yeast reporter gene assay, which scored loss-of-function mutations in p53, PAH o-quinones were found to be highly mutagenic but only under redox cycling conditions. The dominant mutation observed was a G to T transversion that was suppressed by ROS scavengers (27Yu D. Berlin J.A. Penning T.M. Field J. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2002; 15: 832-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Subsequent HPLC analysis coupled with electrochemical detection showed that there was a linear correlation between 8-oxo-dGuo formation in p53 and mutation frequency, indicating that 8-oxo-dGuo was the likely adduct responsible for the G to T transversions observed (28Park J.H. Gelhaus S. Vedantam S. Oliva A.L. Batra A. Blair I.A. Troxel A.B. Field J. Penning T.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2008; 21: 1039-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These data suggest that oxidative DNA lesions caused by PAH o-quinones are more relevant in causing mutation than covalent PAH o-quinone-DNA adducts. In the latter case even if these adducts form, they do not appear to be mutagenic on p53. Recently, using either a hOGG1-coupled comet assay or an immunoaffinity capture-stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography/electrospray ionization/multiple reaction monitoring/mass spectrometry (LC/ESI/MRM/MS) assay, it was shown that both the AKR substrate (B[a]P-7,8-trans-dihydrodiol) and the AKR product (B[a]P-7,8-dione) caused significant DNA strand breaks and 8-oxo-dGuo formation in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells (25Park J.H. Mangal D. Tacka K.A. Quinn A.M. Harvey R.G. Blair I.A. Penning T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6846-6851Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Similar results were not observed with (+)-anti-7,8-dihydroxy-9α,10β-epoxy-7,8,9,10-tetrahydroB[a]P or the regioisomer B[a]P-4,5-trans- dihydrodiol in these AKR-expressing cells. Subsequent use of the fluorescent dye dichlorofluorescein diacetate revealed that B[a]P-7,8-dione generated ROS in the nuclear compartment of the cells, suggesting that the PAH o-quinone was transported into the nucleus to increase the ROS-mediated DNA strand breaks and 8-oxo-dGuo (25Park J.H. Mangal D. Tacka K.A. Quinn A.M. Harvey R.G. Blair I.A. Penning T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6846-6851Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In addition, earlier disposition studies detected significant amounts of [3H]B[a]P-7,8-dione in the cell pellets of primary rat hepatocytes within 0.5 h, which caused extensive strand scission of the genomic DNA (29Flowers L. Bleczinski W.F. Burczynski M.E. Harvey R.G. Penning T.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13664-13672Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), suggesting that B[a]P-7,8-dione reached the nucleus. However, how PAH o-quinones gain entry into the nucleus and induce oxidative DNA damage is currently unknown. PAH o-quinones are ligands for the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) (30Burczynski M.E. Penning T.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 908-915PubMed Google Scholar). These quinones can promote translocation of AhR to nucleus to induce P4501A1 expression. Upon binding with PAH o-quinones, the AhR dissociates from heat shock protein 90 and is rapidly translocated into nucleus where it dimerizes with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT) (31Hoffman E.C. Reyes H. Chu F.F. Sander F. Conley L.H. Brooks B.A. Hankinson O. Science. 1991; 252: 954-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 32Bohonowych J.E. Denison M.S. Toxicol. Sci. 2007; 98: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The quinone-bound AhR·ARNT complex then binds to the xenobiotic response element (XRE) and robustly activates the expression of AhR-regulated genes (30Burczynski M.E. Penning T.M. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 908-915PubMed Google Scholar). These data raise the possibility that oxidative DNA damage caused by PAH o-quinones occurs because of their transportation and concentration in the nucleus mediated by the AhR. However, this hypothesis has not been formally tested. We now show that B[a]P-7,8-dione produces AhR-dependent DNA strand breaks and 8-oxo-dGuo formation using murine Hepa1c1c7 cells but not in its AhR-deficient variant. Similar results were obtained in human bronchoalveolar carcinoma H358 cells, but these effects were attenuated when the AhR was knocked down with siRNA. DNA lesions were measured by using the comet assay, which was coupled with hOGG1. These results were also confirmed by LC-ESI/MRM/MS assay for 8-oxo-dGuo. Our finding shows that PAH o-quinones produced by AKRs can cause ROS-mediated genotoxicity via an AhR-dependent mechanism, and this might contribute to PAH-mediated carcinogenesis. (±)-B[a]P-7,8-dione was synthesized according to published methods (33Harvey R.G. Dai Q. Ran C. Penning T.M. J. Org. Chem. 2004; 69: 2024-2032Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The purity and identity of all PAH metabolites were checked by LC/MS before use. Cell culture media, reagents, and DNAzol BD were obtained from Invitrogen. HiPerFect transfection reagent was acquired from Qiagen. hOGG1 was obtained from New England BioLabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). Bovine pancreas DNase I was purchased from Calbiochem Co. (San Diego, CA), and phosphodiesterase I was acquired from Worthington (Lakewood, NJ). All other chemicals were of the highest grade available and all solvents were HPLC grade. B[a]P-7,8-dione is potentially hazardous and should be handled in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for the Laboratory Use of Chemical Carcinogens. Human bronchoalveolar H358 cells (ATCC number CRL-5807) were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, and 100 unit/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Murine Hepa1c1c4 (ATCC no. CRL-2717), Hepa1c1c7 (ATCC number CRL-2026), and Hepa1c1c12 (ATCC number CRL-2710) cells were maintained in α-minimal essential medium (without nucleosides) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% l-glutamine, and 100 unit/ml penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and passaged every 4 days at a dilution of 1:5. H358 cells were seeded in a 12-well plate (2.5 × 105 cells) or 60-mm culture dish (1.4 × 106 cells) 24 h before introducing small interfering AhR-specific RNA duplexes. The sense and antisense sequences of AhR siRNA were 5′-GGAUUAAAUUAGUUUGUGAdTdT-3′ and 5′- UCACAAACUAAUUUAAUCCdAdA-3′, respectively. The siRNA was purchased from Qiagen. AhR-specific siRNA oligonucleotide (50 nm) was then transfected into cells with HiPerFect Transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. The knockdown of AhR with the siRNA duplexes was repeated 24 h after the initial transfection. The siRNA-transfected cells were incubated for a further 24 h before use. Confluent (90–100%) H358 and Hepa cells were plated in either a 12-well plate (∼1.3 × 106) or a 60-mm culture dish (∼7 × 106) depending on the assay. The cells were washed with HBSS containing Mg2+ and Ca2+. H358 cells were then treated with HBSS buffer containing 0–500 μm H2O2 for 40 min, 2.5 mm KBrO3 for 3 h, or 20 μm B[a]P-7,8-dione for 3, 6, 9, and 12 h, respectively. Hepa cells were treated with HBSS containing 5% α-minimal essential medium with and without fetal bovine serum and treated similarly with H2O2, KBrO3, or B[a]P-7,8-dione. The cells were treated with 0 or 3% DMSO as negative controls. To investigate the effects of ROS attenuators, desferal (an iron chelator and antioxidant) and α-tocopherol (an antioxidant) were added to the media to attain final concentrations of 1 and 0.25 mm, respectively, 2 h prior to treatment of the cells with B[a]P-7,8-dione. α-Naphthoflavone (α-NF) was also used at a final concentration of 1 μm and was added to the cells 1 h before B[a]P-7,8-dione treatment. At the end of PAH treatment, the cells were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently treated with 50 μl (12-well plate) or 200 μl (60-mm culture dish) of proteinase K (200 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline) for each of 5 min. The cells were suspended in 150 μl (12-well plate) or 600 μl (60-mm culture dish) of cold culture medium and kept on ice until used. The cells (1 × 105 cells) were used for the comet assay to measure DNA strand breaks. In addition one set of cells (1.2 × 106) from a 12-well plate was used to prepare a total cell lysate for Western blot analysis and another set of cells (6.9 × 106) from a 60-mm culture dish were subjected to LC/ESI/MRM/MS analysis for quantification of 8-oxo-dGuo in the DNA pellet. Cell viability was checked by the trypan blue exclusion method. Unless otherwise stated, cell viability was >95%. All of the experiments were repeated at least three times. DNA strand breaks in cells were measured using a hOGG1-coupled comet assay as previously published (25Park J.H. Mangal D. Tacka K.A. Quinn A.M. Harvey R.G. Blair I.A. Penning T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6846-6851Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 34Mangal D. Vudathala D. Park J.H. Lee S.H. Penning T.M. Blair I.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2009; 22: 788-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The cells (1 × 105 cells) were mixed with 85 μl of 0.7% low melting point agarose. The agarose cell suspensions were immediately embedded onto an agarose-precoated fully frosted microscope glass slide (70 × 25 mm; Fischer) using a coverslip (No 1, 24 × 50 mm; Corning Inc., Corning, NY) to spread the mixture. The mixture was allowed to form a gel on an ice bath for 5 min. A second agarose gel layer was used to cover the surface of the layer of cells embedded in agarose by using 85 μl of the same low melting point agarose. The slides were then soaked with cell lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, 2.5 m NaCl, 100 mm Na2-EDTA, and 1% sodium sarcosinate plus 10% DMSO and 1% Triton X-100, pH 10.0) for at least 1 h to remove all cellular components and to leave behind the nucleus and genomic DNA. At the end of the cell lysis, the slides were placed in a horizontal electrophoretic apparatus with fresh alkaline electrophoretic buffer (300 mm NaCl and 1 mm Na2-EDTA, pH > 12.0) for 20 min to allow the DNA to unwind and to reveal the alkali labile damage. Electrophoresis was conducted for 20 min at 25 V and 300 mA at a temperature of 4 °C. When the comet assay was coupled to hOGG1, the assay was performed as follows. After cell lysis, the slides were washed three times with hOGG1 enzyme buffer (40 mm HEPES, 0.1 m KCl, 0.5 mm Na-EDTA, and 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 8.0) for 5 min and treated with 60 μl of hOGG1 (0.08 unit in phosphate-buffered saline) for 20 min at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere. hOGG1-treated slides were processed as described above to permit DNA unwinding and exposure of the alkali labile damage. After electrophoresis, the slides were neutralized with Tris-HCl buffer (0.4 m Tris, pH 7.4) for 5 min and stained with 80 μl of ethidium bromide (2 μg/ml in H2O). Ethidium bromide-stained nucleoids were examined using an epifluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse E600; Nikon Instrument Inc.) equipped with a excitation filter (535–550 nm) and a barrier filter (590–650 nm). To quantify the amount of DNA damage, 100 comets/slide were scored visually and classified according to tail intensity and assigned a value of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 (0 indicates undamaged,1 indicates slightly damaged, 2 indicates moderately damaged, 3 indicates severely damaged, and 4 indicates very severely damaged). The total score for 100 comets was again divided by factor of 5 to yield an arbitrary value ranging from 0 (if the counted hundred comets are all undamaged) to 80 (if the counted 100 comets are all very severely damaged). Extraction and enzymatic hydrolysis of genomic DNA was performed as published (25Park J.H. Mangal D. Tacka K.A. Quinn A.M. Harvey R.G. Blair I.A. Penning T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6846-6851Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 34Mangal D. Vudathala D. Park J.H. Lee S.H. Penning T.M. Blair I.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2009; 22: 788-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The DNA was extracted from 6.9 × 106 cells using DNAzol BD (Invitrogen) and then quantitatively digested by the addition of 556 units of DNase I, one unit of phosphodiesterase I (from Crotalus adamanteus venom), 6 units of shrimp alkaline phosphatase and spiked with an internal standard [15N5]8-oxo-dGuo. The resultant DNA digests were filtered through 0.22-μm nylon filters before analysis. The DNA samples were divided into two aliquots. One aliquot was used for the isolation and detection of 8-oxo-dGuo via immunoaffinity capture stable isotope dilution LC/ESI/MRM/MS analyses. The remaining aliquot was used for DNA base analysis. DNA hydrolysates were diluted with 50 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.02% sodium azide and loaded onto an 8-oxo-dGuo mAb 4E9 coupled CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B column. The column was washed with phosphate buffer followed by a further wash with water. 8-Oxo-dGuo was eluted with 50% methanol. The samples were dried under vacuum, and the residue was dissolved in Chelex-treated HPLC water. The analysis of 8-oxo-dGuo was conducted on API 4000 (Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex) equipped with positive ESI source, CTC autosampler (CTC Analytics), and Analyst 1.4.1 software as described previously (34Mangal D. Vudathala D. Park J.H. Lee S.H. Penning T.M. Blair I.A. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2009; 22: 788-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Chromatography was performed with a Phenomenex Luna C18 column (3 μm; 2.0 × 150 mm) with a C18 guard column cartridge (4 × 2.0 mm) using a gradient (2–15% acetonitrile in 0.02% formic acid (v/v) for the first 15 min, 15% acetonitrile for 1 min, and then a gradient of 15–2% acetonitrile for 1 min and 2% acetonitrile for the last 10 min, at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min). During sample analysis, the column effluent was diverted to waste for the first 5 min and the last 12 min to prevent extraneous material from entering the mass spectrometer. For detecting 8-oxo-dGuo, MRM was conducted in the positive ESI mode on m/z 284 (MH+, 8-oxo-dGuo) → m/z 168 (MH+-deoxyribose+H) and m/z 289 (MH+, [15N5]8-oxo-dGuo) → m/z 173 (MH+-deoxyribose+H). Quantification of 8-oxo-dGuo was achieved by using Analyst 1.4.1 from raw spectral data. A calibration curve (range, 50 pg/ml to 5 ng/ml) was obtained by plotting the ratio of the peak area of 8-oxo-dGuo to the internal standard [15N5]8-oxo-dGuo obtained by LC-MRM/MS against known amounts of 8-oxo-dGuo (limit of detection = 0.353 fmol). The base analysis of DNA samples was conducted with a Hitachi HPLC system equipped with an L-2130 pump, L-2200 autosampler, and L-2450 diode array detector. DNA base separation was conducted with a Phenomenex Luna C18 column (5 μm; 4.6 × 250 mm) with a C18 guard column cartridge (4 × 3.0 mm) using a gradient (5–15% acetonitrile in water (v/v) for the first 12 min, 15–80% acetonitrile for 2 min, and then 80% acetonitrile for 6 min and 5% acetonitrile for the last 10 min; the flow rate was 0.8 ml/min). A calibration curve (range, 0–50 μg/ml) was obtained with a linear regression analysis of the peak area of known amounts of DNA base. Unknown amounts of DNA base levels in the DNA samples were calculated by interpolation from the calibration curve. The cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) and lysed with cold radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1% Triton X-100 (v/v), 1% sodium deoxycholate (w/v), 0.1% SDS (w/v), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitor cocktails). The lysates were kept on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the resultant supernatants were saved as cytosolic protein extracts at −80 °C until used. Nuclear proteins from the precipitated pellets were extracted with a nuclear extraction kit (Marligen Bioscience, Urbana Pike, MD). Briefly, the pellets were washed twice with complete wash solution and suspended in the mixture of same volume of complete extraction buffer A and B. Then the samples were incubated on ice for 30 min to extract nuclear proteins. After centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C, the supernatants were stored at −80 °C until used. The protein concentrations of cytosolic and nuclear extracts were measured using the Bradford assay (35Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), and Western blot analysis was performed as previously described (36Jiang H. Vudathala D.K. Blair I.A. Penning T.M. Chem. Res. Toxicol. 2006; 19: 68-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Proteins (50 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nitrocellulose filters (Bio-Rad). The filters were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse AhR antibody at a 1:500 dilution (SA-210; Biomol), rabbit polyclonal anti-human AhR antibody (Sc-5579; Santa Cruz), or goat polyclonal anti-murine ARNT antibody (sc-Sc-8078; Santa Cruz). The immunoblots were developed by incubation with either goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase or donkey anti-goat IgG-horseradish peroxidase as the secondary antibody followed by ECL detection (GE Healthcare). To examine the role of AhR in enhancing PAH o-quinone-mediated DNA damage, we took advantage of three Hepa cell lines: ARNT-deficient Hepa1c1c4 cells, AhR-deficient Hepa1c1c12 cells, and their wild type counterpart Hepa1c1c7 cells. The phenotype of these cells was checked by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 2A). The Hepa1c1c4 cells yield an immunopositive band for ARNT because this subline expresses a point mutation G326D that prevents binding of the AhR·ARNT heterodimer to the XRE (37Numayama-Tsuruta K.

https://openalex.org/W1972444437,"Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is an osteoblast-enriched transcription factor that regulates osteocalcin transcription and osteoblast terminal differentiation. To identify functional partners of ATF4, we applied ROS17/2.8 osteoblast nuclear extracts and purified recombinant His-ATF4 onto a Ni(+) affinity matrix chromatography column. Vimentin was identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Coimmunoprecipitation and pulldown assays revealed that vimentin interacted with ATF4 with its first leucine zipper domain. DNA cotransfection and gel retardation demonstrated that vimentin inhibited the transactivation activity of ATF4 on osteocalcin by preventing it to bind OSE1, the ATF4 binding site on the osteocalcin promoter. Northern hybridization revealed that vimentin was expressed at a high level in immature osteoblasts and a low level in fully differentiated osteoblasts. Down-regulation of vimentin by small interfering RNA induced endogenous osteocalcin transcription in immature osteoblasts. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of vimentin in osteoblasts inhibited osteoblast differentiation as shown by lower alkaline phosphatase activity, delayed mineralization, and decreased expression of osteoblast marker genes such as bone sialoprotein and osteocalcin. Together, our data uncover a novel mechanism whereby a cytoskeletal protein, vimentin, acts as a break on differentiation in immature osteoblasts by interacting with ATF4."
https://openalex.org/W2118741073,"Wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) attacks the integrity of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) barrier system. The pathogenic process was hypothesized to be mediated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and antagonized by pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF). To dissect these functional interactions, monolayer cultures of RPE cells were established, and changes in transepithelial resistance were evaluated after administration of PEDF, placenta growth factor (VEGF-R1 agonist), and VEGF-E (VEGF-R2 agonist). A recently described mechanism of VEGF inhibition in endothelia required the release of VEGF-R1 intracellular domain by γ-secretase. To evaluate this pathway in the RPE, cells were pretreated with inhibitors DAPT or LY411575. Processing of VEGF receptors was assessed by Western blot analysis. Administration of VEGF-E rapidly increased RPE permeability, and PEDF inhibited the VEGF-E response dose-dependently. Both γ-secretase antagonists prevented the inhibitory effects of PEDF. The co-administration of PEDF and VEGF-E depleted the amount of VEGF-R2 in the membrane and increased the amount of VEGF-R2 ectodomain in the media. Therefore, the inhibitory effect of PEDF appears to be mediated via the processing of VEGF-R2 by γ-secretase. γ-Secretase generates the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide of Alzheimer disease from its precursor (amyloid precursor protein). This peptide is also a component of drusen in dry AMD. The results support the hypothesis that misregulation of γ-secretase may not only lead to Aβ deposits in dry AMD but can also be damaging to RPE function by blocking the protective effects of PEDF to prevent VEGF from driving the dry to wet AMD transition.

This fluid causes a local detachment of the retina in the macular area resulting in decreased visual acuity in the center of the visual field (1Tranos P.G. Wickremasinghe S.S. Stangos N.T.

The resulting macular edema can lead to complete vision loss (2Augustin A.J. Puls S. Offermann I. Retina. 2007; 27: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Although the excessive fluid mainly comes from capillaries in the inner retina, the removal of subretinal fluid is dependent on the RPE. The maintenance of RPE barrier function is essential for the efficient removal of the fluid (3Marmor M.F. Documenta Ophthalmologica. 1999; 97: 239-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the disruption of the RPE barrier can eventually lead to choroidal neovascularization. age-related macular degeneration vascular endothelial growth factor pigment epithelium-derived factor transepithelial resistance (3,5-difluorophenylacetyl)-l-alanyl-l-2-phenylglycine t-butylester amyloid precursor protein amyloid-β C-terminal fragment after α-secretase cleavage of APP bromoenol lactone retinal pigment epithelium a disintegrin and metalloproteinase phosphate-buffered saline bromoenol lactone dimethyl sulfoxide.

Originally, VEGF was described as an endothelial angiogenic and vasopermeability factor. The leakage through the vessels of the inner retina increases in response to VEGF (7Antcliff R.J. Marshall J. Semin. Ophthalmol. 1999; 14: 223-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 8Gillies M.C. Documenta Ophthalmologica. 1999; 97: 251-260Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the release of VEGF also affects RPE function (9Ghassemifar R. Lai C.M. Rakoczy P.E. Cell Tissue Res. 2006; 323: 117-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 10Hartnett M.E. Lappas A.

BenEzra D. Behar-Cohen F. Diabetologia. 2007; 50: 461-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that RPE barrier integrity is modulated by VEGF through apically oriented VEGF-R2 receptors (12Ablonczy Z. Crosson C.E. Exp. Eye Res. 2007; 85: 762-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, there is a growing body of evidence that intraocular VEGF can increase the permeability of both the inner and outer blood-retina barriers, contributing to the accumulation of subretinal fluid and macular edema. Pigment epithelium-derived factor was initially identified as a neurotrophic agent secreted by fetal human RPE cells (13Tombran-Tink J. Chader G.G. Johnson L.V. Exp. Eye Res. 1991; 53: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). Subsequent experiments have recognized that PEDF is an endogenous antagonist of VEGF (14Tombran-Tink J. Front. Biosci. 2005; 10: 2131-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In the eye, studies have provided evidence that endothelial quiescence and barrier function is achieved through a balance of VEGF and PEDF (15Ohno-Matsui K. Morita I. Tombran-Tink J. Mrazek D. Onodera M. Uetama T. Hayano M. Murota S.I. Mochizuki M. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 189: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The PEDF secretion pattern from the RPE cells is predominantly apical, and the interphotoreceptor matrix around the RPE microvilli is a major reservoir of PEDF (16Maminishkis A. Chen S. Jalickee S. Banzon T. Shi G. Wang F.E. Ehalt T. Hammer J.A. Miller S.S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2006; 47: 3612-3624Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 17Tombran-Tink J. Shivaram S.M. Chader G.J. Johnson L.V. Bok D. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4992-5003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we hypothesize that PEDF can antagonize the breakdown of RPE function induced by the apical actions of VEGF. Several schemes have been proposed for the anti-VEGF activity of PEDF. A PEDF receptor has been identified, which has phospholipase A2 activity (18Notari L. Baladron V. Aroca-Aguilar J.D. Balko N. Heredia R. Meyer C. Notario P.M. Saravanamuthu S. Nueda M.L.

PEDF binding proteins without clear receptor activity have also been found (19Alberdi E. Aymerich M.S. Becerra S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31605-31612Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In endothelial cells, PEDF has also been shown to compete with VEGF for binding at the VEGF-R2 receptor (20Zhang S.X. Wang J.J. Gao G. Parke K. Ma J.X. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 37: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). PEDF was found to regulate VEGF expression (20Zhang S.X. Wang J.J. Gao G. Parke K. Ma J.X. J. Mol.

Biosci. 2005; 10: 2131-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). A recent study in endothelia has elucidated a novel inhibitory mechanism of VEGF signaling via the PEDF-induced intramembrane proteolysis of VEGF-R1 by γ-secretase (22Cai J. Jiang W.G. Grant M.B. Boulton M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3604-3613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The goal of our study is to determine if PEDF acts as an anti-permeability agent in the RPE and to begin to understand the cellular mechanism involved in this response. Culture conditions were similar to those published previously (12Ablonczy Z. Crosson C.E. Exp. Eye Res. 2007; 85: 762-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The ARPE-19 cells (American Type Culture Collections, Manassas, VA) were cultured according to the vendor's instructions. Primary porcine RPE cultures were established from porcine eyes obtained from a local abattoir (Burbage Meats, Ravenel, SC). The primary cells were not passaged. Both ARPE-19 and primary RPE cells were plated on permeable-membrane inserts (Costar Clear Transwell, 0.4-μm pore, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ) or culture dishes (Corning Cellbind 60 mm, Fisher) containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12/Ham (Sigma) with 1% fetal bovine serum (Amersham Biosciences), 1.2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate (Fisher), and 10 ml/liter l-glutamine-penicillin-G-streptomycin (2 mm, 100 units/ml, 0.1 mg/ml, respectively, Sigma) in a humidified incubator, kept at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The media was changed every 2–3 days. Transepithelial resistance (TER) and inulin permeability measurements assessed barrier function. TER was monitored with an epithelial volt-ohmmeter (WPI, Sarasota, FL) equipped with an STX2 electrode (WPI). Resistance values for individual wells were determined from four independent measurements and corrected for the inherent resistance of the membrane inserts. For each condition, at least three independent experiments were performed. Values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. and compared by using Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Only confluent monolayer cultures with stable TER values (reached within 3 weeks for ARPE 19 cells and 8 weeks for primary RPE cells (12Ablonczy Z. Crosson C.E. Exp. Eye Res. 2007; 85: 762-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar)) were used. VEGF (human VEGF-A165, Sigma), placenta growth factor (PlGF-1, Fitzgerald Industries International, Inc., Concord, MA), or VEGF-E (Fitzgerald) was administered to the apical or basal sides of membrane inserts with confluent monolayers (50 pg/ml to 50 ng/ml) in the absence or presence of PEDF (0.01–10 ng/ml, BioProducts, Middleton, MD). Baseline transepithelial resistance was measured at −60 min, and immediately prior to agonist administration (t = 0). Following this treatment, resistance was measured at 2 h. To evaluate the actions of the γ-secretase inhibitors, cultures were pretreated 60 min prior to the above treatments with DAPT (1 nm to 10 μm, Peptide International, Louisville, KY), LY411575 (100 pm to 1 μm), or vehicle (0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide, Sigma). To evaluate the phospholipase A2 action of the PEDF receptor, cells were pretreated 60 min prior to the above treatments with 25 μm BEL (Sigma) or vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)). Concentration-dependence curves were analyzed with Prism 4.02 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). The inulin permeability was determined from the apical to basolateral movement of inulin measured over 100 min using carboxyl-[14C]inulin (50 μCi, 1.6 mCi/g, Moravek Biochemicals, Brea, CA). Aliquots of radioactive inulin, containing 0.5 μCi, were diluted with 100 times as much cold inulin (MP Biochemicals, Solon, OH) and added to the apical chambers of membrane inserts with confluent ARPE-19 cell monolayers 5 h after treatment with apical VEGF (10 ng/ml); apical VEGF (10 ng/ml) and apical PEDF (5 ng/ml); or vehicle (PBS). The 5-h delay between the VEGF and inulin administrations ensured that inulin flux was measured in steady state, because TER was previously found to change little between 5 and 24 h after VEGF administration (12Ablonczy Z. Crosson C.E. Exp. Eye Res. 2007; 85: 762-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Aliquots of 100 μl were removed from the basolateral chamber at the time of inulin administration, and every 20 min afterward up to 100 min and replaced by equal amounts of media without inulin. The samples were placed into 24-well microplates (Packard, Meriden, CT), mixed with 900 μl of Microscint-20 scintillation fluid (Packard), and counted in a scintillation chamber (TopCount, Packard). Values are expressed as the mean of six, independent wells ±S.E. and compared by the Student t test. Inulin flux was determined from linear regression analysis of the amount of inulin present in the basolateral chamber versus elapsed time. Porcine eyes were enucleated, and their anterior segment was removed. Thereafter, the eyecups were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde (Mallinckrodt Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ) in PBS overnight at 4 °C. The following day they were washed three times in PBS at room temperature, and then treated with 30% sucrose (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. The next day the eyecups were washed three times in PBS at room temperature, embedded in Tissue-Tek optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetek, Torrence, CA) and frozen, and 12-μm slices were cut horizontally in an HM550 cryostat (Microm, Walldorf, Germany). The slices were placed on microscope slides, washed three times in PBS at room temperature, and permeabilized by exposure to 0.2% Triton X-100 (VWR, West Chester, PA) in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. Thereafter, the slices were washed in PBS (three times) at room temperature, and incubated with primary antibody (rabbit anti-VEGF-R2, diluted 1:100, Chemicon, Temecula, CA) for 1 h at 4 °C (negative controls were incubated with PBS only). The slides were then washed three times in PBS again, and incubated with secondary antibody (rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-rabbit, diluted 1:50, Chemicon) for 30 min at room temperature. The slides were treated with nuclear stain (DRAQ5, Biostatus, Shepshed, UK) and examined using a Leica SP2 confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) and software (LCS 2.6). Monolayers were grown to confluence on membrane inserts. The apical and basolateral media was replaced with fresh serum-free media (2 ml each), and the cells were subjected to four different treatments according to schedules described under “Cell Treatments”: VEGF-E (5 ng/ml); PEDF (1 ng/ml); PEDF (1 ng/ml) and VEGF-E (5 ng/ml); DAPT (1 μm) and PEDF (1 ng/ml) and VEGF-E (5 ng/ml). At the close of the 2-h treatment, the apical and basolateral media (2 ml each) was collected into individual centrifuge tubes. To remove cell debris, the media was centrifuged for 5 min at 2800 × g, the supernatant was collected and concentrated down to a volume of 130 μl with 30-min centrifugation at 2800 × g through a 50,000 Da cut-off Amicon filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Entire volumes of concentrated media was separated on 7% Tris-acetate gels and analyzed by Western blotting using an antibody against the ectodomain of the VEGF-R2 receptor (Sigma) or VEGF-R1 receptor (Chemicon) to determine levels and fragmentation of the VEGF receptors obtained through the individual treatments. Recombinant human VEGF-R2 and VEGF-R1 (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) was used as positive control. The lanes were visualized with a VersaDoc 5000 imager (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) after treatment with chemiluminescent reagent (Amersham Biosciences) and analyzed with the Quantity One 4.4.1 software. For each condition, at least three, independent experiments were performed. Values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. and compared by using Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. For these experiments, monolayers were grown to confluence on 100-mm culture dishes. The cells were incubated overnight with serum-free media, and then the media were replaced with fresh serum-free media, and the cells were subjected to four different treatments according to schedules described under “Cell Treatments”: vehicle (0.1% DMSO); VEGF-E (5 ng/ml); DAPT (1 μm) and PEDF (1 ng/ml) and VEGF-E (5 ng/ml); PEDF (1 ng/ml) and VEGF-E (5 ng/ml). At the close of the treatment, the cultures were washed with PBS and lysed with the addition of 1 ml of buffer (2.42 g/liter Tris Base, 1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.3 m sucrose, 1 mm Na3VO4, 20 mm NaF, 1 complete mini protease inhibitor tablet, pH 7.5; the chemicals were obtained from Sigma, and the protease inhibitor was from Roche Applied Science). The cells were scraped, collected into centrifuge tubes, triturated with a 26-gauge needle syringe, and centrifuged for 5 min at 11,000 × g, and the supernatant was collected. Equal quantities of the various samples (determined by protein assay) were separated on 7% Tris-acetate gels and analyzed by antibodies against the C terminus of VEGF-R2 and VEGF-R1 (both from Chemicon), or the amyloid precursor protein (APP, Genway, San Diego, CA). For each condition, at least three independent experiments were performed. Values are expressed as the mean ± S.E. and compared by using Student's t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. VEGF has been shown to induce RPE barrier failure through apical VEGF-R2 receptors (12Ablonczy Z. Crosson C.E. Exp. Eye Res. 2007; 85: 762-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Thus, ARPE-19 and porcine primary RPE cells were grown on permeable membrane filters and treated with apical VEGF-E (5 ng/ml), and apical or basal PEDF (5 ng/ml). Fig. 1 shows TER measurements on ARPE-19 (Fig. 1A) and porcine primary RPE cell monolayers (Fig. 1B). In both cultures, apically administered VEGF-E reduced the paracellular resistance. This TER drop was blocked by the apical administration of PEDF. Basolateral administration of PEDF did not significantly alter the VEGF-E-induced drop in TER in either culture type. No significant change in resistance was measured after apical treatment with placenta growth factor (5 ng/ml) followed by either apical or basal administration of PEDF (data not shown). The paracellular flux of carboxyl-[14C]inulin in ARPE-19 cell monolayers is a direct measure of barrier function (Fig. 1C). In vehicle-treated (PBS) monolayers, mean inulin flux was 580 μg/h. Administration of apical VEGF (10 ng/ml) produced a 36% increase in inulin flux to 780 μg/h. On the other hand, co-treatment of the monolayers with both apical VEGF (10 ng/ml) and apical PEDF (5 ng/ml) resulted in a flux of 570 μg/h, which was similar to the inulin flux in the vehicle-treated controls. The results that only apical treatment with PEDF could antagonize the apical VEGF-R2-dependent RPE cell response (Fig. 1) and that PEDF could compete with VEGF for binding at the VEGF-R2 receptor (20Zhang S.X. Wang J.J. Gao G. Parke K. Ma J.X. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 37: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), favors a mechanism in which the polarity of the VEGF and PEDF response is determined by VEGF-R2 localization. Cross-sections of porcine eyecups (Fig. 2) were used to investigate the localization of VEGF-R2 in vivo. The transmitted light layer of the image revealed the non-pigmented photoreceptor inner and outer segments, and the pigmented RPE/choroid. In the RPE, only the apical surface was stained red indicating the presence of VEGF-R2 in relation to the cell nuclei (blue stain). In control eyecups, processed without the VEGF-R2 primary antibody, no staining was observed in the RPE, although the blue cell nuclei were visible at the same exciting light intensity. In a cell-free system, PEDF at concentrations between 10−8 and 10−6 m competed with VEGF for binding at VEGF-R2 (20Zhang S.X. Wang J.J. Gao G. Parke K. Ma J.X. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 37: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). ARPE-19 and primary porcine RPE cell monolayers were treated with VEGF-E (5 ng/ml) and various concentrations of PEDF (0.01–10 ng/ml). To assess functional responses, Fig. 3A shows the percent change in TER at 2 h relative to pretreatment control values. In both culture systems, the TER decrease induced by VEGF-E was dose-dependently inhibited by PEDF. Log IC50 was −10.54 ± 0.06 (IC50 = 29 pg/ml, 0.6 pm) for ARPE-19 cells and −10.05 ± 0.1 (IC50 = 89 pg/ml, 1.9 pm) for porcine primary RPE cells. The Hill coefficients of the concentration-response curves were not significantly different from 1. This interaction was further studied by determining the VEGF-E concentration-induced responses in ARPE-19 cells under control conditions, and in the presence of two different concentrations of PEDF (10 and 50 pg/ml). Fig. 3B shows the drop in percent reduction in TER at 2 h in the presence and absence of PEDF. Gaddum-Schild analysis of these responses revealed a pA2 value (the negative logarithm of the concentration of an antagonist required to cause a two-fold rightward shift of the agonist dose-response curve) of 11.85 ± 0.30 and a slope 1.03 ± 0.22 of for PEDF. Thus, the pharmacologic responses to PEDF are consistent with a competitive inhibitor and the calculated binding affinity was Kb = 1.4 ± 0.7 pg/ml. The concentration-response data showed that 1 ng/ml PEDF induced a maximal inhibition of the VEGF-induced TER decrease. Therefore, in subsequent mechanistic experiments, we used 1 ng/ml concentration of PEDF. The Gaddum-Schild analysis revealed that the actions of PEDF are consistent with a competitive VEGF-R2 antagonist. However, the VEGF response was reversed by PEDF at concentrations 100–1000 times lower than required to inhibit VEGF binding to VEGF-R2. Recent studies in endothelial cells have provided evidence that PEDF induces shedding of VEGF-R1 via the activation of γ-secretase (22Cai J. Jiang W.G. Grant M.B. Boulton M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3604-3613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Because shed receptors may act as competitive blockers sequestering VEGF, we evaluated whether γ-secretase activation was needed for PEDF to suppress VEGF actions in RPE cells. Monolayers of ARPE-19 (Fig. 4A) and primary porcine (Fig. 4B) RPE cells were pretreated with the γ-secretase inhibitor DAPT (1 μm) or vehicle (0.1% DMSO) 1 h prior to treatment with PEDF (1 ng/ml) and/or VEGF-E (5 ng/ml). Pretreatment with DAPT prevented PEDF from blocking the VEGF-E-induced reduction in TER. Neither PEDF nor DAPT alone could significantly alter the resistance readout. To confirm these results, monolayer cultures of ARPE-19 cells were pretreated with various concentrations of DAPT or LY411575 1 h prior to treatment with PEDF (1 ng/ml) and VEGF-E (5 ng/ml). LY411575 is a γ-secretase inhibitor more potent than DAPT (23Weihofen A. Lemberg M.K. Friedmann E. Rueeger H. Schmitz A. Paganetti P. Rovelli G. Martoglio B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16528-16533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4C both antagonists reversed the inhibitory action of PEDF on the VEGF-induced barrier breakdown in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the response for LY411575 (EC50 = 4 nm) was left shifted when compared with DAPT (EC50 = 29 nm). The activity of γ-secretase was quantitated by measuring APP processing (24Zhou Y. Suram A. Venugopal C. Prakasam A. Lin S. Su Y. Li B. Paul S.M. Sambamurti K. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 47-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). APP is cleaved by α-secretase to produce the soluble sAPPα and the membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (CTFα), which is further processed by γ-secretase. Thus, the activity of γ-secretase is inversely proportional to the amount of CTFα. Confluent ARPE-19 cell monolayers were pretreated with DAPT (1 μm) or vehicle (0.1% DMSO) 60 min prior to treatment with VEGF-E (5 ng/ml) and/or PEDF (1 ng/ml). Fig. 5(A and B) shows that the addition of VEGF-E alone produced a small but not significant increase in γ-secretase activity. Co-administration of PEDF and VEGF-E for 2 h increased γ-secretase activity by 24%, in agreement with the results of Cai et al. (22Cai J. Jiang W.G. Grant M.B. Boulton M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3604-3613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) extrapolated for this short time period. Pretreatment with DAPT blocked γ-secretase activity and caused an accumulation of CTFα, as expected. Similar to Cai et al. (22Cai J. Jiang W.G. Grant M.B. Boulton M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 3604-3613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), PEDF did not significantly change γ-secretase activity in 2 h (data not shown). Fig. 5C confirms that the expression of the catalytic subunit of γ-secretase, presenilin-1, did not significantly change during the incubation period. To assess whether the activation of a recently reported PEDF receptor (18Notari L. Baladron V. Aroca-Aguilar J.D. Balko N. Heredia R. Meyer C. Notario P.M. Saravanamuthu S. Nueda M.L. Sanchez-Sanchez F. Escribano J. Laborda J. Becerra S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38022-38037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) is required to antagonize RPE barrier failure, monolayer cultures of ARPE-19 cells were pretreated with BEL, a phospholipase A2 inhibitor. Phospholipase A2 activity has been a measure of receptor stimulation (18Notari L. Baladron V. Aroca-Aguilar J.D. Balko N. Heredia R. Meyer C. Notario P.M. Saravanamuthu S. Nueda M.L. Sanchez-Sanchez F. Escribano J. Laborda J. Becerra S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38022-38037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Fig. 5D indicates that 1-h pretreatment with BEL (25 μm) prior to treatment with PEDF (1 ng/ml) and/or VEGF-E (5 ng/ml) did not significantly alter the ability of PEDF to inhibit the TER decrease induced by VEGF-E. Reported γ-secretase substrates are generally first processed close to the cell surface to shed their ectodomain. Then, the membrane-bound C-terminal fragment is processed by γ-secretase to release the intracellular domain (25Pinnix I. Musunuru U. Tun H. Sridharan A. Golde T. Eckman C. Ziani-Cherif C. Onstead L. Sambamurti K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 481-487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Our physiological data provided evidence that, in RPE cells, VEGF-R2 can be a target of γ-secretase. To begin to understand this process, we studied the release of VEGF-R2 ectodomain into the media of the membrane inserts in response to 2-h treatments with PEDF (1 ng/ml) and VEGF-E (5 ng/ml) and 1-h pretreatment with DAPT (1 μm) or vehicle (0.1% DMSO). Fig. 6A shows representative Western blot bands obtained with an antibody against the ectodomain of VEGF-R2 in the apical media. A broad band at 160 kDa is shown consistently with a previous report for soluble VEGF-R2 (26Ebos J.M. Bocci G. Man S. Thorpe P.E. Hicklin D.J. Zhou D. Jia X. Kerbel R.S. Mol. Cancer Res. 2004; 2: 315-326PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 6B presents the quantitation of data obtained in three independent experiments normalized to the levels found in the VEGF-E-treated controls. The amount of VEGF-R2 ectodomain was not significantly different after vehicle treatment (data not shown). Co-treatment with PEDF and VEGF-E led to an increase in the levels of VEGF-R2 ectodomain. This increase was blocked by 1-h pretreatment with DAPT. The basolateral media did not contain VEGF-R2 ectodomain (data not shown). To confirm that VEGF-R2 is released from RPE membranes we examined the levels of VEGF-R2 in cellular membrane extracts using a C-terminal VEGF-R2 antibody. ARPE-19 cells were treated with PEDF (1 ng/ml) and VEGF-E (5 ng/ml) similar to the above experiments (Fig. 6A). Fig. 6D shows representative Western blot bands, and Fig. 6E quantitates the obta"
https://openalex.org/W2043224021,"Ischemic injury of the heart is associated with activation of multiple signal transduction systems including the heterotrimeric G-protein system. Here, we report a role of the ischemia-inducible regulator of G betagamma subunit, AGS8, in survival of cardiomyocytes under hypoxia. Cultured rat neonatal cardiomyocytes (NCM) were exposed to hypoxia or hypoxia/reoxygenation following transfection of AGS8siRNA or pcDNA::AGS8. Hypoxia-induced apoptosis of NCM was completely blocked by AGS8siRNA, whereas overexpression of AGS8 increased apoptosis. AGS8 formed complexes with G-proteins and channel protein connexin 43 (CX43), which regulates the permeability of small molecules under hypoxic stress. AGS8 initiated CX43 phosphorylation in a G betagamma-dependent manner by providing a scaffold composed of G betagamma and CX43. AGS8siRNA blocked internalization of CX43 following exposure of NCM to repetitive hypoxia; however it did not influence epidermal growth factor-mediated internalization of CX43. The decreased dye flux through CX43 that occurred with hypoxic stress was also prevented by AGS8siRNA. Interestingly, the G betagamma inhibitor Gallein mimicked the effect of AGS8 knockdown on both the CX43 internalization and the changes in cell permeability elicited by hypoxic stress. These data indicate that AGS8 is required for hypoxia-induced apoptosis of NCM, and that AGS8-G betagamma signal input increased the sensitivity of cells to hypoxic stress by influencing CX43 regulation and associated cell permeability. Under hypoxic stress, this unrecognized response program plays a critical role in the fate of NCM."
https://openalex.org/W2014356162,"Traditionally, biodiversity conservation gap analyses have been focused on governmental protected areas (PAs). However, an increasing number of social initiatives in conservation (SICs) are promoting a new perspective for analysis. SICs include all of the efforts that society implements to conserve biodiversity, such as land protection, from private reserves to community zoning plans some of which have generated community-protected areas. This is the first attempt to analyze the status of conservation in Latin America when some of these social initiatives are included. The analyses were focused on amphibians because they are one of the most threatened groups worldwide. Mexico is not an exception, where more than 60% of its amphibians are endemic. We used a niche model approach to map the potential and real geographical distribution (extracting the transformed areas) of the endemic amphibians. Based on remnant distribution, all the species have suffered some degree of loss, but 36 species have lost more than 50% of their potential distribution. For 50 micro-endemic species we could not model their potential distribution range due to the small number of records per species, therefore the analyses were performed using these records directly. We then evaluated the efficiency of the existing set of governmental protected areas and established the contribution of social initiatives (private and community) for land protection for amphibian conservation. We found that most of the species have some proportion of their potential ecological niche distribution protected, but 20% are not protected at all within governmental PAs. 73% of endemic and 26% of micro-endemic amphibians are represented within SICs. However, 30 micro-endemic species are not represented within either governmental PAs or SICs. This study shows how the role of land conservation through social initiatives is therefore becoming a crucial element for an important number of species not protected by governmental PAs."
https://openalex.org/W2086643797,"Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) is a key transcription factor regulating cellular responses to hypoxia and is composed of alpha and beta subunits. During normoxia, factor inhibiting HIF-1 (FIH-1) inhibits the activity of HIF-1 by preventing HIF-1alpha binding to p300/CBP via modification of the Asn(803) residue. However, it is not known whether FIH-1 activity can be regulated in an oxygen-independent manner. In this study, we survey possible binding proteins to FIH-1 and identify Mint3/APBA3, which has been reported to bind Alzheimer beta-amyloid precursor protein. Purified Mint3 binds FIH-1 and inhibits the ability of FIH-1 to modify HIF-1alpha in vitro. In a reporter assay, the activity of HIF-1alpha is suppressed because of endogenous FIH-1 in HEK293 cells, and expression of Mint3 antagonizes this suppression. Macrophages are known to depend on glycolysis for ATP production because of elevated HIF-1 activity. FIH-1 activity is suppressed in macrophages by Mint3 so as to maintain HIF-1 activity. FIH-1 forms a complex with Mint3, and these two factors co-localize within the perinuclear region. Knockdown of Mint3 expression in macrophages leads to redistribution of FIH-1 to the cytoplasm and decreases glycolysis and ATP production. Thus, Mint3 regulates the FIH-1-HIF-1 pathway, which controls ATP production in macrophages and therefore represents a potential new therapeutic target to regulate macrophage-mediated inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W2132073262,"The transnitrosylating nitric oxide (NO) donor nitrocysteine (CysNO) induced a disulfide bond between the two regulatory RI subunits of protein kinase A (PKA). The conventional NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine failed to do this, consistent with our observation that it also did not promote protein S-nitrosylation. This disulfide oxidation event activated PKA and induced vasorelaxation independently of the classical beta-adrenergic or NO signaling pathway. Activation of PKA had also been anticipated to exert a positive inotropic effect on the myocardium but did not. The lack of positive inotropy was explained by CysNO concomitantly activating protein kinase G (PKG) Ialpha. PKG was found to exert a partial negative inotropic influence regardless of whether PKA was activated by classical beta-receptor stimulation or by disulfide bond formation. This work demonstrates that NO molecules that can induce S-nitrosylation directly activate type I PKA, providing a novel cross-talk to beta-adrenergic-like signaling without receptor or adenylate cyclase stimulation. However, the expected positive inotropic consequences of PKA activation by this novel mechanism are countermanded by the simultaneous dual activation of PKGIalpha, which is also activated by CysNO."
https://openalex.org/W2090631555,"By now, little is known on L-type calcium channel (LTCC) subunits expressed in mouse heart. We show that CaVbeta2 proteins are the major CaVbeta components of the LTCC in embryonic and adult mouse heart, but that in embryonic heart CaVbeta3 proteins are also detectable. At least two CaVbeta2 variants of approximately 68 and approximately 72 kDa are expressed. To identify the underlying CaVbeta2 variants, cDNA libraries were constructed from poly(A)(+) RNA isolated from hearts of 7-day-old and adult mice. Screening identified 60 independent CaVbeta2 cDNA clones coding for four types of CaVbeta2 proteins only differing in their 5' sequences. CaVbeta2-N1, -N4, and -N5 but not -N3 were identified in isolated cardiomyocytes by RT-PCR and were sufficient to reconstitute the CaVbeta2 protein pattern in vitro. Significant L-type Ca(2+) currents (I(Ca)) were recorded in HEK293 cells after co-expression of CaV1.2 and CaVbeta2. Current kinetics were determined by the type of CaVbeta2 protein, with the approximately 72-kDa CaVbeta2a-N1 shifting the activation of I(Ca) significantly to depolarizing potentials compared with the other CaVbeta2 variants. Inactivation of I(Ca) was accelerated by CaVbeta2a-N1 and -N4, which also lead to slower activation compared with CaVbeta2a-N3 and -N5. In summary, this study reveals the molecular LTCC composition in mouse heart and indicates that expression of various CaVbeta2 proteins may be used to adapt the properties of LTCCs to changing myocardial requirements during development and that CaVbeta2a-N1-induced changes of I(Ca) kinetics might be essential in embryonic heart."
https://openalex.org/W2019724758,"iso-Migrastatin and related glutarimide-containing polyketides are potent inhibitors of tumor cell migration and their implied potential as antimetastatic agents for human cancers has garnered significant attention. Genome scanning of Streptomyces platensis NRRL 18993 unveiled two candidate gene clusters (088D and mgs); each encodes acyltransferase-less type I polyketide synthases commensurate with iso-migrastatin biosynthesis. Both clusters were inactivated by λ-RED-mediated PCR-targeting mutagenesis in S. platensis; iso-migrastatin production was completely abolished in the ΔmgsF mutant SB11012 strain, whereas inactivation of 088D-orf7 yielded the SB11006 strain that exhibited no discernible change in iso-migrastatin biosynthesis. These data indicate that iso-migrastatin production is governed by the mgs cluster. Systematic gene inactivation allowed determination of the precise boundaries of the mgs cluster and the essentiality of the genes within the mgs cluster in iso-migrastatin production. The mgs cluster consists of 11 open reading frames that encode three acyltransferase-less type I polyketide synthases (MgsEFG), one discrete acyltransferase (MgsH), a type II thioesterase (MgsB), three post-PKS tailoring enzymes (MgsIJK), two glutarimide biosynthesis enzymes (MgsCD), and one regulatory protein (MgsA).

Synthetic analogs of these natural products have also been investigated and found to retain potent activity despite significant structural truncation (6Njardarson J.T. Gaul C. Shan D. Huang X.Y.

Retention of activity by such analogs supports the effectiveness of the privileged scaffolds highlighted by iso-MGS, MGS, LTM, and related natural products. Complementary to organic synthesis, combinatorial biosynthesis offers an alternative means of accessing natural product structural diversity. We have previously studied the biosynthetic pathway of these polyketides and shown that MGS and the DGNs are shunt metabolites of iso-MGS (9Ju J. Lim S.K. Jiang H. Shen B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 1622-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). As has been demonstrated in Streptomyces platensis NRRL 18993, one of the known iso-MGS producers, iso-MGS, MGS, and the DGNs are produced by a single biosynthetic machinery and iso-MGS undergoes H2O-mediated, non-enzymatic ring-expansion, and ring-opening rearrangements to afford MGS and the DGNs as shunt metabolites. We have also isolated iso-MGS congeners as minor fermentation products, produced a small library of glutarimide-containing polyketides featuring the iso-MGS, LTM, MGS, and DGN scaffolds, and found selected analogs with biological activity to far surpass those of MGS (10Ju J.

In so doing, we have shown the general superiority of 12-membered macrolides over the 14-membered analogs as glutarimide-containing polyketide inhibitors of cell migration. Yet, the ability to readily convert members of the 12-membered macrolides into their corresponding 14-membered and acyclic congeners synthetically presents us with novel structural diversity capabilities not commonly encountered biosynthetically. Cloning and characterization of the gene cluster governing iso-MGS biosynthesis, therefore, represents a significant undertaking with many foreseeable ramifications in drug discovery. iso-migrastatin acyl carrier protein amidotransferase acyltransferase cluster identification library dorrigocins dehydratase enoylreductase genome sampling library ketoreductase ketoacyl synthase lactimidomycin methyl transferase oxidoreductase polyketide synthase thioesterase open reading frame. iso-migrastatin acyl carrier protein amidotransferase acyltransferase cluster identification library dorrigocins dehydratase enoylreductase genome sampling library ketoreductase ketoacyl synthase lactimidomycin methyl transferase oxidoreductase polyketide synthase thioesterase open reading frame.

Genomic DNAs from S. platensis strains were prepared according to standard protocols (16Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, United Kingdom2000Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was prepared with Qiagen mini-prep kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA). Cosmids were prepared by the standard alkaline methods (15Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY2001Google Scholar). λ-RED-mediated PCR-targeting mutagenesis was carried out according to literature procedures (16Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, United Kingdom2000Google Scholar). The expand high fidelity PCR system (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN) was used for all PCR experiments, and PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T to confirm fidelity by sequencing and restriction enzyme digestions. Southern analysis was performed according to standard protocols (15Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY2001Google Scholar) using the DIG system (Roche, Palo Alto, CA). DNA sequencings were performed using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). S. platensis protoplast preparation and transformation were carried out according to standard protocols (16Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, United Kingdom2000Google Scholar). E. coli-S. platensis intergeneric conjugation was performed by following literature procedures (16Kieser T. Bibb M.J. Buttner M.J. Chater K.F. Hopwood D.A. Practical Streptomyces Genetics. The John Innes Foundation, Norwich, United Kingdom2000Google Scholar) but with three alterations: (i) S. platensis spores in 2xYT were germinated at 50 °C for 10 min followed by incubation at 28 °C for additional 8–12 h to be used as recipients, (ii) E. coli ET12567/pUZ8002 was used as donors, and (iii) trimethoprim, instead of nalidixic acid, was used to kill the E. coli donors for selecting S. platensis exconjugants. Genome scanning was performed as previously described (18Zazopoulos E. Huang K. Staffa A. Liu W. Bachmann B.O. Nonaka K. Ahlert J. Thorson J.S. Shen B. Farnet C.M. Nat. Biotechnol. 2003; 21: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Briefly, chromosomal DNA from S. platensis was fragmented by sonication, and DNA fragments of 1–3 kb size were ligated into pUC19 to construct a genome sampling library (GSL). Complementary chromosomal DNA of S. platensis was partially digested with SauIIIAI, and DNA fragments between 40 and 50 kb were ligated into the BamHI site of SuperCosI to construct a cluster identification library (CIL). Overlapping CILs harboring the putative clusters were identified by probing with selected PKS genes and sequenced. Sequence analysis was carried out by the Genetics Computer Group program (Madison, WI) and BLAST. Functional assignments of the deduced gene products were based on comparisons to known PKSs, including the AT-less type I PKS for leinamycin (19Cheng Y.Q. Tang G.L. Shen B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 3149-3154Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 20Tang G.L. Cheng Y.Q. Shen B. Chem. Biol. 2004; 11: 33-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) and the archetypical type I PKS for rapamycin (21Aparicio J.F. Molnár I. Schwecke T. König A. Haydock S.F. Khaw L.E. Staunton J. Leadlay P.F. Gene. 1996; 169: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), and other proteins of known functions. The DNA sequence reported here has been deposited in GenBankTM under accession number GQ274953. One open reading frame (088D-orf7 located on pBS11002 for the 088D cluster) and eight genes (mgs-orf(-1), mgsA, mgsB, mgsC, mgsD, all located on pBS11004, and mgsF, mgsH, and mgs-orf1, all located on pBS11006) for the mgs cluster were inactivated in S. platensis by following the λ-RED-mediated PCR-targeting mutagenesis method (17Gust B. Challis G.L. Fowler K. Kieser T. Chater K.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 1541-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (1206) Google Scholar). Thus, each of the targeted genes was replaced by the aac(3)V-oriT cassette from pIJ773 via λ-RED-mediated PCR-targeting strategy using oligonucleotide pairs KS1-delF and KS1-delR, orf(-1)-delF and orf(-1)-delR, mgsA-delF and mgsA-delR, mgsB-delF and mgsB-delR, mgsC-delF and mgsC-delR, mgsD-delF and mgsD-delR, KS4-delF and KS4-delR, mgsH-delF and mgsH-delR, and orf1-delF and orf1-delR (supplemental Table S2) to yield pBS11007, pBS11008, pBS11009, pBS11010, pBS11011, pBS11012, pBS11013, pBS11014, and pBS11015, respectively (supplemental Table S1). Each of the mutant constructs were confirmed by PCR using primer pairs KS1-CF and KS1-CR, orf(-1)-CF and orf(-1)-CR, mgsA-CF and mgsA-CR, mgsB-CF and mgsB-CR, mgsC-CF and mgsC-CR, mgsD-CF and mgsD-CR, KS4-CF and KS4-CR, mgsH-CF and mgsH-CR, and orf1-CF and orf1-CR, respectively (supplemental Table S2). They were subsequently introduced into the S. platensis wild-type strain by intergeneric conjugation between S. platensis-E. coli ET12567/pUZ8002. Exconjugants with the aparamycin-resistant and kanamycin-sensitive phenotypes were selected as the desired double crossover mutants. Their genotypes were finally confirmed by Southern analysis using the aac(3)V gene, the targeted gene, or both as probes (supplemental Table S2). The correct mutant strains were named SB11006 (Δ088D-orf7), SB11007 [Δmgs-orf(-1)], SB11008 (ΔmgsA), SB11009 (ΔmgsB), SB11010 (ΔmgsC), SB11011 (ΔmgsD), SB11012 (ΔmgsF), SB11013 (ΔmgsH), and SB11014 (Δmgs-orf1), respectively (supplemental Table S1). The mgsH expression plasmid pBS11019 was constructed in a pSET152-based integrative plasmid to complement the ΔmgsH mutation in strain SB11013. First, the kanamycin resistance gene (neo) was amplified by PCR from pBS11004 with primer pair NeoSacF and NeoSacR (supplemental Table S2) and cloned as an SacI fragment to replace the apramycin resistance gene [aac(3)IV] in pSE152 to afford pBS11016. Second, the aac(3)IV promoter was amplified by PCR from pIJ773 with primer pairs Apr-ProF and Apr-ProR (supplemental Table S2), cloned into pGEM-T, and moved as an EcoRI fragment into pGEM-3Zf to yield pBS11017. Third, the mgsH gene was amplified from pBS11004 by PCR with primer pair mgsH-compF and mgsH-compR (supplemental Table S2), cloned into pGEM-T, and moved as an XbaI fragment into the same site of pBS11017 to afford pBS11018. Fourth, a HindIII fragment, harboring the aac(3)IV promoter and mgsH, was released from pBS11018, blunt-ended with T4-DNA polymerase, and cloned into the EcoRV site of pBS11016 to yield pBS11019. Finally, pBS11019 was introduced into SB11013 by conjugation. Exconjugants were selected on the basis of resistance to both apramycin and kanamycin and named SB11015, in which the expression of mgsH is under the control of the apramycin resistance gene promoter to complement the ΔmgsH mutation in the SB11013 strain in trans (supplemental Table S1). S. platensis fermentation and isolation and analysis of iso-MGS, MGS, and the DGNs were carried out as described previously (9Ju J. Lim S.K. Jiang H. Shen B. J. Am. Chem.

A two-stage fermentation process was used, with both stages utilizing the same medium. Thus, 50 μl of spore suspension were inoculated into 50 ml of medium and incubated on a rotary shaker at 250 rpm, 28 °C for 2 days. The resultant seed culture (2.5 ml) was then inoculated into 50 ml of fresh medium with or without the addition of XAD-16 (15%) or HP-20 (7%) resins, and incubation continued under the same condition for 4–10 days. In the presence of XAD-16 or HP-20, iso-MGS was isolated as the major metabolite. In the absence of XAD-16 or HP-20, iso-MGS underwent rapid H2O-mediated, non-enzymatic ring-expansion and ring-opening rearrangement to afford MGS and the DGNs as the major metabolites (9Ju J.

HPLC analysis of iso-MGS, MGS, and the DGNs were carried out on Varian HPLC system (Woburn, MA) using a Prostar 330 detector and a Prodigy ODS-2 column (150 × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) (9Ju J. Lim S.K. Jiang H.

The mobile phases consisted of buffer A (15% CH3CN in H2O containing 0.1% HOAc) and buffer B (80% CH3CN in H2O containing 0.1% HOAc). The column was eluted with a linear gradient of 100% buffer A to 20% buffer A and 80% buffer B over 20 min, followed by 5 min at 20% buffer A and 80% buffer B at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min with UV detection at 205 nm. Under these conditions, iso-MGS, MGS, and DGN A, and DGN B were eluted with retention times of 18.8, 14.6, 11.8, and 11.1 min, respectively. The identities of the metabolites were confirmed previously by MS and 1H and 13C NMR analyses (2Karwowski J.P. Jackson M. Sunga G. Sheldon P. Poddig J.B. Kohl W.L. Kadam S. J.

PKS genes generated from a GSL were used as probes to identify clones containing PKS genes from the CIL. Five clones, named pBS11002, pBS11003, pBS11004, pBS11005, and pBS11006, were identified, sequenced, analyzed, and mapped to two distinct loci. The overlapping cosmids pBS11002 and pBS11003 form the biosynthetic gene cluster named 088D (supplemental Fig. S1). The overlapping cosmids pBS11004, pBS11005, and pBS11006 were converged to form the mgs gene cluster (Fig. 2). Both the 088D and mgs clusters were found to contain genes encoding AT-less type I PKSs, type II acyl carrier proteins (ACPs), and amidotransferases (AMTs) likely associated with biosynthesis of glutarimide-containing polyketides (4Sugawara K.

Introduction of either replicative plasmids such as pKC1139 and pKC1218 or integrative plasmid pSET152 into S. platensis by protoplast transformation was not successful despite extensive effort (16Kieser T.

E. coli-Streptomyces intergeneric conjugation proved central to all genetic studies herein. Optimal conjugation was achieved by using (i) S. platensis spores as recipients that were prepared by prolonged heat-shock, (ii) E. coli ET12567 (pUZ8002) as donors that provided unmethylated donor DNA, and (iii) trimethoprim to eliminate E. coli from the desired S. platensis exconjugants because S. platensis is sensitive to nalidixic acid, the most commonly used antibiotic in E. coli-Streptomyces conjugation (16Kieser T.

Under these conditions, the integrative plasmid pSET152 can be introduced into S. platensis with a frequency of 10−6, introduction of replicative plasmids such as pKC1139 and pKC1218, carrying the pSG5 and SCP2* replicons, respectively, into S. platensis was not successful, and integration by homologous recombination was not observed for non-replicative plasmid such as pOJ260 that harbors S. platensis DNA (up to 10 kb). Finally, we resorted to the λ-RED-mediated PCR-targeting mutagenesis method, which makes use of the full-length insert on the cosmid to maximize homologous recombination frequency, for gene inactivation in S. platensis. We routinely isolated up to 30 exconjugants per plate, 30% of which were often the desired double crossover mutants. We have previously established that iso-MGS is the nascent biosynthetic product and MGS and the DGNs are shunt metabolites of iso-MGS resulting from H2O-mediated, non-enzymatic ring expansion and ring-opening rearrangements (9Ju J.

Soc. 2005; 127: 11930-11931Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We have subsequently optimized iso-MGS production and established isolation and analytical protocols for iso-MGS, MGS, and the DGNs (9Ju J. Lim S.K. Jiang H. Shen B. J. Am. Chem.

Thus, iso-MGS was the predominant metabolite if S. platensis fermentation was supplemented with hydrophobic resins such as XAD-16 or HP-20 (Fig. 3A, trace I), whereas in the absence of the resins, MGS and the DGNs were the major products (Fig. 3B, trace I). 088D-orf7 encodes an AT-less type I PKS comprised of five PKS modules (supplemental Fig. S1 and Table S3). Inactivation of the 088D locus was achieved by replacing the PKS module-1 of 088D-orf7 with the aac(3)IV-oriT cassette as depicted in Fig. 4A. The genotype of the resultant Δ008D-orf7 mutant SB11006 strain was confirmed by Southern analysis using probes against both the aac(3)IV gene and a fragment of 088D-orf7 (Fig. 4B). SB11006 was fermented under the established conditions in the presence of XAD-16 with the S. platensis wild-type strain as a positive control. HPLC analysis showed that the SB11006 mutant strain still produced iso-MGS and there was no difference in metabolite profile between the S. platensis wild-type and SB11006 mutant strains (Fig. 3A, traces I and II). The mgsF gene encodes an AT-less type I PKS consisting of six PKS modules (Fig. 2 and Table 1), and the mgs locus was next inactivated by replacing the PKS module-4 of mgsF with the aac(3)IV-oriT cassette as depicted in Fig. 4C. The resulting SB11012 mutant strain was similarly confirmed by Southern analysis (Fig. 4D). SB11012 was fermented in the presence of XAD resin with the S. platensis wild-type strain as a positive control, and HPLC analysis revealed that SB11012 cannot produce iso-MGS (Fig. 3A, traces I and III).TABLE 1Deduced functions of op"

IntroductionThe chaperone ClpA is a member of the AAA+ protein family (ATPase-associated with various cellular activities) and catalyzes the energy-dependent degradation of proteins through interaction with the protease ClpP in Escherichia coli (1Hwang B.J. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8727-8734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Katayama Y. Gottesman S. Pumphrey J. Rudikoff S. Clark W.P. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol.

Biol. 2009; 19: 209-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), ClpA oligomerizes into a ring structure, shaping a central pore through which substrate proteins are routed into the proteolytic core ClpP. This process involves unfolding and translocation of the substrate protein and requires the consumption of ATP. AAA proteins can be grouped into class I (two ATPase domains) and class II (one ATPase domain) ATPases. The fact that some ATPases have only one AAA module whereas others seem to require two ATPase domains stimulated researchers to investigate the roles and interdependence of the two ATP-binding modules in class I AAA proteins like Hsp104 and ClpB (5Doyle S.M.

Biol. 2007; 370: 674-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). ClpA also features two ATPase domains, termed D1 and D2. They are highly homologous, but differences in the amino acid sequence around the conserved regions in D1 and D2 suggested that they might have a somewhat different function (9Gottesman S. Squires C. Pichersky E. Carrington M. Hobbs M. Mattick J.S. Dalrymple B. Kuramitsu H. Shiroza T. Foster T. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1990; 87: 3513-3517Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). As was shown for several other class I members, ClpA assembles into its oligomeric state only upon binding of nucleotide (10Maurizi M.R. Singh S.K. Thompson M.W. Kessel M. Ginsburg A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7778-7786Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Indeed, substituting the invariant lysine in the Walker A motif demonstrated that nucleotide binding to D1 triggers ClpA hexamerization, whereas ATP turnover is mainly catalyzed by D2 (11Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29537-29545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Seol J.H. Baek S.H. Kang M.S. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8087-8092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). However, mutations in the Walker A motif also abolish or drastically decrease the affinity for ATP, making it impossible to distinguish between effects due to ATP binding and those due to ATP hydrolysis.To study the role of ATP hydrolysis in both ATPase domains uncoupled from nucleotide binding events, we designed ClpA Walker B variants that lack the ability to hydrolyze ATP in either D1 (ClpAE286A), D2 (ClpAE565A), or both domains (ClpAE286A/E565A) but still bind ATP in both domains. This allowed us to probe the function of ATP turnover in D1 independent from ATP hydrolysis in D2, and vice versa, to reveal whether ATP hydrolysis is allosterically coupled or whether ATP consumption in D1 and D2 occurs nonconcomitantly. ClpA recognizes several classes of substrates. One example are the ssrA-tagged proteins that carry an 11-amino acid tag that is added to stalled nascent chains. This tag is recognized at the ClpA pore.The substrate specificity of ClpA is modulated by an adaptor protein, ClpS, that inhibits degradation of ssrA-tagged substrates (13Dougan D.A. Reid B.G. Horwich A.L. Bukau B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 673-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 14Hou J.Y. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and simultaneously promotes processing of N-end rule substrates (15Erbse A. Schmidt R. Bornemann T. Schneider-Mergener J. Mogk A.

These substrates are recognized due to their N-terminal amino acids followed by a flexible stretch of amino acids, for example the FR in the model substrate FRli-GFP. We studied the influence of various substrate proteins, ClpS-dependent or ClpS-independent, bearing an N- or C-terminal degradation tag, on the ATPase and degradation activity of ClpA harboring only one active ATPase domain. Furthermore, we addressed the directionality of ClpS-mediated N-end rule substrate processing. Taken together, this study provides new mechanistic insights on how the two ATPase domains of ClpA work together to unfold and translocate substrate proteins into ClpP.DISCUSSIONIn this study we investigated the function of ATP turnover in the two ATPase domains of ClpA. We show that ATP hydrolysis in D1 and D2 can be selectively disabled by replacing the catalytic glutamate located in the Walker B motif (Glu-286 or Glu-565) (Fig. 1, a and b). The retained binding of nucleotide to the catalytically inactive ATP-binding sites allows correct and complete assembly of all ClpA Walker B variants as confirmed by analytical gel filtration. Thus, any observed change in ATPase activity can be ascribed to the replacement of the catalytic glutamate rather than to an assembly defect. We further found that the ability of ClpA to bind ssrA-tagged proteins is also not impaired by replacement of the catalytic glutamate.Comparing ATPase activities of the two single Walker B variants (ClpAE286A and ClpAE565A) shows that the minor part (∼10%) of the overall ATPase activity is provided by the first AAA module as demonstrated previously by Singh and Maurizi (11Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29537-29545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ATP saturation curves for the two ClpA Walker B variants reveal that D1 has an ∼10-fold lower half-saturation point for ATP than D2. ClpAwt displays a K½ of ∼400 μm suggesting that the mutation in the D1 Walker B motif slightly affects ATP binding to D2. However, the individual ATPase activities of ClpAE286A and ClpA565A add up to ClpAwt level (Fig. 1e and Table 1) suggesting that ATP hydrolysis in D1 is not coupled to ATP hydrolysis in D2. The absence of allosteric interdependence of the two ATPase domains is surprising, because a strong coupling of the two ATPase domains was reported for Hsp104 (8Schaupp A. Marcinowski M. Grimminger V. Bösl B. Walter S. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 370: 674-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), a related class I AAA protein. When D1 was deactivated in Hsp104 (E285Q), the ATPase activity increased approximately eight times, whereas abolishing ATP binding to D1 (K218T) led to a 45-fold decrease. Similar results were obtained for Hsp104 D2 variants proving inter-domain cooperativity.The ATPase activity of ClpA, however, is modulated by its binding partners. For example, binding of ClpP stimulates ATP hydrolysis, whereas binding of ClpS on the other hand inhibits the overall ATPase activity (14Hou J.Y. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 288-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 29Hinnerwisch J. Reid B.G. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40838-40844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). By analyzing how the two variants are affected, i.e. whether ClpAE565A, ClpAE286A, or both variants are modulated by binding of ClpP or ClpS, we established that it is only the second AAA module that is stimulated by ClpP and inhibited by ClpS (Fig. 1e). Hence, ClpP and ClpS affect selectively the second ATPase domain of ClpA. Both the stimulatory and inhibitory effects are comparable with ClpAwt, and consequently, the individual ATPase activities of ClpAE286A and ClpA565A add up to the wild type level (Table 1). This demonstrates that neither ClpP nor ClpS causes a strict coupling of D1 and D2.The stimulatory effect of ClpP on D2 is comprehensible, because in the hexameric ClpA ring the D2 domain makes contact with the ClpP cylinder. The inhibitory effect of ClpS cannot be explained by a stable domain interface, because ClpS has been shown to bind to the flexible N-terminal domain remote from D2 (13Dougan D.A. Reid B.G. Horwich A.L. Bukau B. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 673-683Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The crystal structure of ClpS in complex with the ClpA N domain might offer an explanation (42Guo F. Esser L. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. Xia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46753-46762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 43Zeth K. Ravelli R.B. Paal K. Cusack S. Bukau B. Dougan D.A. Nat. Struct.

Chem. 2002; 277: 46753-46762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) suggest two models of ClpS binding resulting in two species present, when concentrations of ClpS reach a certain threshold. At low ClpS concentrations, the model where ClpS fits into an empty space between D1 and D2 predominates, so that ClpS makes contact with a helix connecting D1 and D2 (42Guo F. Esser L. Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. Xia D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46753-46762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In this position ClpS is in close proximity to D2 allowing ClpS to interact with the second AAA module.It has been suggested previously that ATP hydrolysis occurs mainly in D2 providing the energy for substrate unfolding (11Singh S.K. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29537-29545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Seol J.H. Baek S.H. Kang M.S. Ha D.B. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8087-8092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Because ClpAE565A retains a low ATPase activity, we tested whether D1 can actively unfold and translocate substrate proteins into the ClpP cavity when D2 has been deactivated. Using the fluorescently labeled model substrate λ-repressor92C-ssrA-F, we monitored the degradation activity of the ClpAP complex (24Twining S.S. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 143: 30-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Because substrate unfolding and translocation into ClpP are energy-consuming processes, the double Walker B variant (ClpAE286A/E565A) was not capable of catalyzing substrate degradation (Fig. 3a, red). Remarkably, despite the low ATPase activity, ClpAE565A could still promote substrate degradation (Fig. 3a, green), providing direct evidence for the functional integrity of the first AAA module capable of unfolding and translocation of substrate proteins (Fig. 3a).The following mechanistic scenario is most likely. D1 converts the chemical energy of ATP into movements of D1 loops, thereby contributing to the overall chaperone activity of ClpA. Despite the low ATPase activity of D1 in comparison with D2, such movements could result in the generation and/or capture of partially unraveled C or N termini, preventing their refolding and dissociation from ClpA and facilitating their handover to the D2 loops. However, without the active motion of the D2 loops, the D1 activity supports only slow degradation, presumably because the further translocation steps into ClpP are unassisted.To test whether the catalytic activity of D1 is substrate-dependent, we analyzed whether D1 could also process more stable substrate proteins. GFP-ssrA and FRli-GFP exhibit very similar free energies of protein folding. Although the global thermodynamic stability of a substrate protein was previously shown to play only a minor role for its susceptibility to degradation (44Burton R.E. Siddiqui S.M. Kim Y.I. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3092-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 45Kenniston J.A. Burton R.E. Siddiqui S.M. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. J. Struct. Biol. 2004; 146: 130-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), the local protein stability adjacent to the terminal degradation tag is important (33Kenniston J.A. Baker T.A. Fernandez J.M. Sauer R.T. Cell. 2003; 114: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 34Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Both the N and C termini of GFP lead into strands that participate in the β-barrel and thus should be in a fairly stable local environment. Hence, GFP either bearing the C-terminal ssrA tag or the N-terminal FRli tag was used to test D1-supported degradation. Remarkably, D1 was also capable of unfolding the very stable β-barrel of GFP (GFP-ssrA) when unraveling occurred from the C terminus (Fig. 3b). In case of FRli-GFP, however, the first ATPase domain alone was now no longer sufficient to support even slow substrate degradation (Fig. 3c, green), indicating that the local thermodynamic stability of the substrate exceeds the energy provided by D1. Furthermore, the second AAA module alone was no longer as efficient in supporting degradation as was wild type ClpA (Fig. 3c, blue).Because the C and N termini of GFP lead into different strands within the β-barrel structure, presumably their local thermodynamic stability also differs (Fig. 2, c and e, and supplemental Fig. S3). In agreement with this, loading the ClpAPS complex with FRli-GFP as a substrate greatly reduced the ATPase activity of ClpAE286A. This effect was not dependent on ClpS because an equivalent experiment without ClpS yielded the same result (Table 1). The individual ATPase activities of ClpAE286A and ClpAE565A no longer add up to wild type ATPase activity, indicating that D1 plays a significant role during FRli-GFP degradation (Table 1). For the C-terminally tagged GFP-ssrA, only a mild reduction in ATPase activity was observed, and the ATPase activities in the first and second module remained additive. We conclude that GFP is more resistant to unraveling from its N terminus.Proteins with the highest mechanical resistance are often all-β proteins, where the β-sheet hydrogen bonding is mostly responsible for opposing mechanical unfolding (46Best R.B. Brockwell D.J. Toca-Herrera J.L. Blake A.W. Smith D.A. Radford S.E. Clarke J. Anal. Chim. Acta. 2003; 479: 87-105Crossref Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is a correlation between the observed change in energy and the number of methylene and methyl groups deleted from hydrophobic side chains in the hydrophobic core of a protein (39Fersht A. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding.in: Julet M.R. Hadler G.L. 3rd Ed. W. H. Freeman & Co., New York2000: 508-509Google Scholar, 47Otzen D.E.

Hence, the local stability against mechanical unfolding is primarily determined by the amount of hydrogen bonds and, presumably to a lesser extent, by hydrophobic interactions. The N-terminal β-strands that are encountered first in the FRli-GFP model substrate are stabilized by a total number of 30 hydrogen bonds, and 27 methylene and methyl groups contribute to the hydrophobic core (Fig. 2e and supplemental Fig. S3). However, the C-terminal β-strands form only 23 hydrogen bonds with neighboring β-strands, and only 17 methylene and methyl groups make hydrophobic contacts, rendering GFP-ssrA less resistant against unraveling from that terminus (Fig. 2c and supplemental Fig. S3). These results suggest that ATP hydrolysis in D1 becomes important when ClpA encounters a very stable protein structure next to the terminal degradation tag. We propose a mechanistic model for ClpAP according to which the local protein stability of the substrate molecule determines whether D1, D2, or both AAA modules have to be hydrolytically active to promote efficient substrate unfolding and translocation (Fig. 6a). For those substrates requiring both ATPase domains to be active, the D1 ATPase activity is mandatory for efficient capture and handover to D2 of the tag-bearing end. This model is consistent with a previous study that states that methotrexate-stabilized E. coli dihydrofolate reductase with an N-terminal tag was not degraded by ClpAP, whereas a circular permutated variant of the same molecule (new N terminus at position 25) was degraded even in the presence of methotrexate (34Lee C. Schwartz M.P. Prakash S. Iwakura M. Matouschek A. Mol. Cell. 2001; 7: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the first seven N-terminal residues of dihydrofolate reductase form a highly stabilized β-strand, whereas residue 25 is located at the N-terminal end of an α-helix rendering the circular permutated protein variant less resistant against mechanical unfolding (50Bolin J.T. Filman D.J. Matthews D.A. Hamlin R.C. Kraut J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13650-13662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).To exclude the possibility that the difference in the mode of recruitment (adaptor-mediated versus direct binding to the pore) could result in different requirements for contributions from the two ATP-binding sites, we designed two additional model substrates. One displays adaptor-mediated recruitment but features a lower local stability at the N terminus than FRli-GFP (Fig. 2b, FRli-T4-lysozyme), and the other is recruited by an ssrA tag directly to the pore without mediation through an adaptor and features a strongly stabilized C-terminal strand (Fig. 2d, FimAta-li-ssrA). In accordance with our proposed model (Fig. 6a), ClpAE286A processed FRli-T4 lysozyme only slightly slower than ClpAwt, and the ATP hydrolysis rate was not reduced (Fig. 3d and Fig. 4c). The C-terminally tagged variant FimAta-li-ssrA, however, induced a strong decrease in ATP turnover when the first AAA module was deactivated in ClpA (Fig. 4d, blue), indicating that D1 assists the second ATPase domain to unravel very stable protein structures. FimAta-li-ssrA indeed appears to be a very demanding substrate with respect to mechanical unfolding by the ClpAP complex. Degradation could not be observed in the presence of ClpAwt and ClpP due to ClpA autodegradation. However, when ClpAΔ9C was used, a ClpA variant lacking the autodegradation signal FimAta-li-ssrA was slowly degraded in an ATP-dependent manner (41Maglica Z. Striebel F. Weber-Ban E. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 384: 503-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S1).We speculate that unfolding of a stable substrate by D2 alone decelerates the up and down movements of the D2 loop that was suggested to transfer the mechanical force to the substrate molecule (27Hinnerwisch J.

Assuming a direct conversion of chemical into mechanical energy, slowing down D2 loop movements must result in a lower ATP turnover in D2. Hence, the decelerated ATP turnover in D2, when D1 is inactive, results directly from high local protein stability of the substrate. This is in good agreement with a previous study by Kenniston et al. (33Kenniston J.A. Baker T.A. Fernandez J.M. Sauer R.T. Cell. 2003; 114: 511-520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) demonstrating that destabilizing the substrate structure near the degradation tag increases the rate of ATP hydrolysis in ClpX. However, unfolding supported by D1 alone appears to be affected also by the ClpS mode of recruitment, because neither FRli-GFP nor FRli-T4 lysozyme can be efficiently processed by D1 in presence of ClpS.Because degradation of λ-repressor92C-ssrA-F, FRli-T4 lysozyme, and GFP-ssrA was also impaired, if only slightly, when D1 was deactivated, we conclude that the first ATPase domain generally contributes to the overall chaperone activity irrespective of ClpS binding to ClpA. It also appears that substrate processing is always assisted by ATP hydrolysis in D1 irrespective of the local substrate stability or location of the tag (Fig. 3, a, b, and d).The considerations of local stability discussed above only apply if the degradation tag, which is recognized directly by ClpA or ClpS, is also the site of unfolding/translocation initiation. It was demonstrated that ssrA-tagged substrate proteins are translocated directionally such that the C terminus enters the ClpP cavity first (20Reid B.G. Fenton W.A. Horwich A.L. Weber-Ban E.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 3768-3772Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Thus, if the position of the tag defines the directionality of translocation, N-end rule substrates should be processed from the N to C terminus. However, the recruitment here is more complex due to the involvement of an adaptor protein, ClpS (15Erbse A. Schmidt R. Bornemann T. Schneider-Mergener J. Mogk A. Zahn R. Dougan D.A. Bukau B. Nature. 2006; 439: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 16Wang K.H. Oakes E.S. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. J. Biol.

To test the directionality in context of the adaptor protein, we designed an N-end rule substrate consisting of eYFP linked C-terminally to GFPuv (FRli-eYFP-GFPuv). Indeed, we found that the eYFP domain, which is preceded by the N-terminal FRli tag, was degraded before the GFPuv domain. This verifies the directional translocation of N-end rule substrates from N to C terminus by the ClpAPS complex. However, recruitment of N-end rule substrates via ClpS implies a handover step from ClpS to ClpA to initiate unfolding through the pore. We resolved the substrate handover step kinetically by comparing the degradation time courses of GFP-ssrA and FRli-GFP under single-turnover conditions. GFP-ssrA degradation by ClpAP commenced instantly, whereas FRli-GFP degradation by ClpAPS was delayed by ∼5 s. A straightforward handover of the very N terminus from ClpS to ClpA is unlikely, as it was previously shown that N-end rule substrates additionally require an unstructured N-terminal region to be degraded by the ClpAPS machinery (15Erbse A. Schmidt R. Bornemann T. Schneider-Mergener J. Mogk A. Zahn R. Dougan D.A. Bukau B. Nature. 2006; 439: 753-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 16Wang K.H. Oakes E.S. Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 24600-24607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Indeed, a hydrophobic motif within this region was recently suggested to serve as a ClpA-binding site (56Ninnis R.L. Spall S.K. Talbo G.H. Truscott K.N. Dougan D.A. EMBO J. 2009; 28: 1732-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears likely that ClpS-mediated substrate recruitment increases the local substrate concentration, which facilitates binding of the substrate to the ClpA pore. We suggest a mechanism that involves binding of the unstructured N-terminal region to the ClpA pore leading to substrate threading and thus eventually triggering the release of the substrate from ClpS. Hence, the 5-s delay can be assigned to a combination of events as follows: (i) the N domain-ClpS complex approaching the ClpA pore, (ii) the binding of a loop structure to the ClpA pore, and (iii) initiation of unfolding (Fig. 6b). The handover of N-end rule substrates is not strictly dependent on ATP hydrolysis in D1 as both model substrates (FRli-T4 lysozyme and FRli-GFP) can be processed by ClpA, even when D1 is not active.In summary, the first AAA module, previously considered as only important for ClpA hexamerization, plays an important role in assisting the second AAA module to resolve very stable protein structures. ATP hydrolysis in D1 could cause loop movements that generate and/or capture the partially unraveled C or N terminus of the substrate protein. Thereby, refolding and dissociation from ClpA of the substrate is prevented and the handover to the D2 loops is facilitated. IntroductionThe chaperone ClpA is a member of the AAA+ protein family (ATPase-associated with various cellular activities) and catalyzes the energy-dependent degradation of proteins through interaction with the protease ClpP in Escherichia coli (1Hwang B.J. Woo K.M. Goldberg A.L. Chung C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8727-8734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Katayama Y. Gottesman S. Pumphrey J. Rudikoff S. Clark W.P. Maurizi M.R. J. Biol.

AMPK is an alphabetagamma heterotrimer where the beta subunit anchors the alpha catalytic and gamma regulatory subunits. Germline deletion of either AMPK beta1 or beta2 subunit isoforms resulted in reduced trabecular bone density and mass, but without effects on osteoclast (OC) or osteoblast (OB) numbers, as compared to wild-type littermate controls. We tested whether activating AMPK in vivo would enhance bone density but found AICA-riboside treatment caused a profound loss of trabecular bone volume (49.5%) and density and associated increased OC numbers. Consistent with this, AICA-riboside strongly stimulated OC differentiation in vitro, in an adenosine kinase-dependent manner. OCs and macrophages (unlike OBs) lacked AMPK beta2 subunit expression, and when generated from AMPK beta1(-/-) mice displayed no detectable AMPK activity. Nevertheless, AICA-riboside was equally effective at stimulating OC differentiation from wild-type or beta1(-/-) progenitors, indicating that AMPK is not essential for OC differentiation or the stimulatory action of AICA-riboside. These results show that AMPK is required to maintain normal bone density, but not through bone cell differentiation, and does not mediate powerful osteolytic effects of AICA-riboside."
https://openalex.org/W1972306120,"Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been proved to play an important role in various cellular processes and function as tumor suppressors or oncogenes in cancers including leukemia. The identification of a large number of novel miRNAs and other small regulatory RNAs will provide valuable insights into the roles they play in tumorgenesis. Methodology/Principal Findings To gain further understanding of the role of miRNAs relevant to acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), we employed the sequencing-by-synthesis (SBS) strategy to sequence small RNA libraries prepared from ALL patients and normal donors. In total we identified 159 novel miRNAs and 116 novel miRNA*s from both libraries. Among the 159 novel miRNAs, 42 were identified with high stringency in our data set. Furthermore, we demonstrated the different expression patterns of 20 newly identified and several known miRNAs between ALL patients and normal donors, suggesting these miRNAs may be associated with ALL and could constitute an ALL-specific miRNA signature. Interestingly, GO “biological process” classifications revealed that a set of significantly abnormally expressed miRNAs are associated with disease relapse, which implies that these dysregulated miRNAs might promote the progression of ALL by regulating genes involved in the pathway of the disease development. Conclusion/Significance The study presents a comprehensive picture of the expression of small RNAs in human acute lymphoblastic leukemia and highlights novel and known miRNAs differentially expressed between ALL patients and normal donors. To our knowledge, this is the first study to look at genome-wide known and novel miRNA expression patterns in in human acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Our data revealed that these deregulated miRNAs may be associated with ALL or the onset of relapse."

The mechanisms by which mTOR senses and regulates energy metabolism and cell growth are relatively well understood, whereas the molecular events underlining how it mediates survival and proliferation remain to be elucidated. Here, we describe the existence of the mTOR splicing isoform, TOR beta, which, in contrast to the full-length protein (mTOR alpha), has the potential to regulate the G(1) phase of the cell cycle and to stimulate cell proliferation. mTOR beta is an active protein kinase that mediates downstream signaling through complexing with Rictor and Raptor proteins. Remarkably, overexpression of mTOR beta transforms immortal cells and is tumorigenic in nude mice and therefore could be a proto-oncogene."
https://openalex.org/W2063132616,"Dominant-negative interference by glycine substitution mutations in the COL7A1 gene causes dominant dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DDEB), a skin fragility disorder with mechanically induced blistering. Although qualitative and quantitative alterations of the COL7A1 gene product, collagen VII, underlie DDEB, the lack of direct correlation between mutations and the clinical phenotype has rendered DDEB less amenable to therapeutic targeting. To delineate the molecular mechanisms of DDEB, we used recombinant expression of wild-type (WT) and mutant collagen VII, which contained a naturally occurring COL7A1 mutation, G1776R, G2006D, or G2015E, for characterization of the triple helical molecules. The mutants were co-expressed with WT in equal amounts and could form heterotrimeric hybrid triple helices, as demonstrated by affinity purification and mass spectrometry. The thermal stability of the mutant molecules was strongly decreased, as evident in their sensitivity to trypsin digestion. The helix-to-coil transition, T(m), of the mutant molecules was 31-34 degrees C, and of WT collagen VII 41 degrees C. Co-expression of WT with G1776R- or G2006D-collagen VII resulted in partial intracellular retention of the collagen, and mutant collagen VII had reduced ability to support cell adhesion. Intriguingly, controlled overexpression of WT collagen VII gradually improved the thermal stability of the collective of collagen VII molecules. Co-expression in a ratio of 90% WT:10% mutant increased the T(m) to 41 degrees C for G1776R-collagen VII and to 39 degrees C for G2006D- and G2015E-collagen VII. Therefore, increasing the expression of WT collagen VII in the skin of patients with DDEB can be considered a valid therapeutic approach."
https://openalex.org/W1976571998,"Apoptosis has been speculated to be involved in schizophrenia. In a previously study, we reported the association of the MEGF10 gene with the disease. In this study, we followed the apoptotic engulfment pathway involving the MEGF10, GULP1, ABCA1 and ABCA7 genes and tested their association with the disease.Ten, eleven and five SNPs were genotyped in the GULP1, ABCA1 and ABCA7 genes respectively for the ISHDSF and ICCSS samples. In all 3 genes, we observed nominally significant associations. Rs2004888 at GULP1 was significant in both ISHDSF and ICCSS samples (p = 0.0083 and 0.0437 respectively). We sought replication in independent samples for this marker and found highly significant association (p = 0.0003) in 3 Caucasian replication samples. But it was not significant in the 2 Chinese replication samples. In addition, we found a significant 2-marker (rs2242436 * rs3858075) interaction between the ABCA1 and ABCA7 genes in the ISHDSF sample (p = 0.0022) and a 3-marker interaction (rs246896 * rs4522565 * rs3858075) amongst the MEGF10, GULP1 and ABCA1 genes in the ICCSS sample (p = 0.0120). Rs3858075 in the ABCA1 gene was involved in both 2- and 3-marker interactions in the two samples.From these data, we concluded that the GULP1 gene and the apoptotic engulfment pathway are involved in schizophrenia in subjects of European ancestry and multiple genes in the pathway may interactively increase the risks to the disease."
https://openalex.org/W2129066702,"Animal species come in many shapes and sizes, as do the individuals and populations that make up each species. To us, humans might seem to show particularly high levels of morphological variation, but perhaps this perception is simply based on enhanced recognition of individual conspecifics relative to individual heterospecifics. We here more objectively ask how humans compare to other animals in terms of body size variation. We quantitatively compare levels of variation in body length (height) and mass within and among 99 human populations and 848 animal populations (210 species). We find that humans show low levels of within-population body height variation in comparison to body length variation in other animals. Humans do not, however, show distinctive levels of within-population body mass variation, nor of among-population body height or mass variation. These results are consistent with the idea that natural and sexual selection have reduced human height variation within populations, while maintaining it among populations. We therefore hypothesize that humans have evolved on a rugged adaptive landscape with strong selection for body height optima that differ among locations."
https://openalex.org/W1979920051,"The calorigenic-thermogenic activity of thyroid hormone (T3) has long been ascribed to uncoupling of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. However, the mode of action of T3 in promoting mitochondrial proton leak is still unresolved. Mitochon-drial uncoupling by T3 is reported here to be transduced in vivo in rats and in cultured Jurkat cells by gating of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP). T3-induced PTP gating is shown here to be abrogated in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) receptor 1 (D?3R1)_/_ cells, indicating that the endoplasmic reticulum IP3R1 may serve as upstream target for the mitochondrial activity of T3. IP3R1 gating by T3 is due to its increased expression and truncation into channel-only peptides, resulting in IP3-independent Ca2+ efflux. Increased cytosolic Ca2+ results in activation of protein phosphatase 2B, dephosphorylation and depletion of mitochondrial Bcl2 (S70), and increase in mitochondrial free Bax leading to low-conductance PTP gating. The T3 transduction pathway integrates genomic and nongenomic activities of T3 in regulating mitochondrial energetics and may offer novel targets for thyromimetics designed to modulate energy expenditure.—Yehuda-Shnaidman, E., Kalderon, B., Azazmeh, N., Bar-Tana, J.

It leads to an increased production of growth factors and proinflammatory and proteolytic proteins, while at the same time cytoskeletal proteins are degraded. Here we used paired normal skin fibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) and primary and recurrent oral squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells to study the nemosis response.Fibroblast nemosis was analyzed by protein and gene expression and the paracrine regulation with colony formation assay. One of the normal fibroblast strains, FB-43, upregulated COX-2 in nemosis, but FB-74 cells did not. In contrast, CAF-74 spheroids expressed COX-2 but CAF-43 cells did not. Alpha-SMA protein was expressed in both CAF strains and in FB-74 cells, but not in FB-43 fibroblasts. Its mRNA levels were downregulated in nemosis, but the CAFs started to regain the expression. FSP1 mRNA was downregulated in normal fibroblasts and CAF-74 cells, but not in CAF-43 fibroblasts. Serine protease FAP was upregulated in all fibroblasts, more so in nemotic CAFs. VEGF, HGF/SF and FGF7 mRNA levels were upregulated to variable degree in nemosis. CAFs increased the colony formation of primary tumor cell lines UT-SCC-43A and UT-SCC-74A, but normal fibroblasts inhibited the anchorage-independent growth of recurrent UT-SCC-43B and UT-SCC-74B cells.Nemosis response, as observed by COX-2 and growth factor induction, and expression of CAF markers alpha-SMA, FSP1 and FAP, varies between fibroblast populations. The expression of CAF markers differs between normal fibroblasts and CAFs in nemosis. These results emphasize the heterogeneity of fibroblasts and the evolving tumor-promoting properties of CAFs."
https://openalex.org/W2127584291,"The members of the AGC kinase family frequently exhibit three conserved phosphorylation sites: the activation loop, the hydrophobic motif (HM), and the zipper (Z)/turn-motif (TM) phosphorylation site. 3-Phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) phosphorylates the activation loop of numerous AGC kinases, including the protein kinase C-related protein kinases (PRKs). Here we studied the docking interaction between PDK1 and PRK2 and analyzed the mechanisms that regulate this interaction. In vivo labeling of recombinant PRK2 by (32)P(i) revealed phosphorylation at two sites, the activation loop and the Z/TM in the C-terminal extension. We provide evidence that phosphorylation of the Z/TM site of PRK2 inhibits its interaction with PDK1. Our studies further provide a mechanistic model to explain different steps in the docking interaction and regulation. Interestingly, we found that the mechanism that negatively regulates the docking interaction of PRK2 to the upstream kinase PDK1 is directly linked to the activation mechanism of PRK2 itself. Finally, our results indicate that the mechanisms underlying the regulation of the interaction between PRK2 and PDK1 are specific for PRK2 and do not apply for other AGC kinases."
https://openalex.org/W1991110888,"CX(3)CL1, a chemokine with transmembrane and soluble species, plays a key role in inflammation by acting as both chemoattractant and adhesion molecule. CX(3)CL1 is the only chemokine known to undergo constitutive internalization, raising the possibility that dynamic equilibrium between the endocytic compartment and the plasma membrane critically regulates the availability and processing of CX(3)CL1 at the cell surface. We therefore investigated how transmembrane CX(3)CL1 is internalized. Inhibition of dynamin using a nonfunctional allele or of clathrin using specific small interfering RNA prevented endocytosis of the chemokine in CX(3)CL1-expressing human ECV-304 cells. Perusal of the cytoplasmic domain of CX(3)CL1 revealed two putative adaptor protein-2 (AP-2)-binding motifs. Accordingly, CX(3)CL1 co-localized with AP-2 at the plasma membrane. We generated a mutant allele of CX(3)CL1 lacking the cytoplasmic tail. Deletion of the cytosolic tail precluded internalization of the chemokine. We used site-directed mutagenesis to disrupt AP-2-binding motifs, singly or in combination, which resulted in diminished internalization of CX(3)CL1. Although CX(3)CL1 was present in both superficial and endomembrane compartments, ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10) and tumor necrosis factor-converting enzyme, the two metalloproteases that cleave CX(3)CL1, localized predominantly to the plasmalemma. Inhibition of endocytosis using the dynamin inhibitor, Dynasore, promoted rapid metalloprotease-dependent shedding of CX(3)CL1 from the cell surface into the surrounding medium. These findings indicate that the cytoplasmic tail of CX(3)CL1 facilitates its constitutive clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Such regulation enables intracellular storage of a sizable pool of presynthesized CX(3)CL1 that protects the chemokine from degradation by metalloproteases at the plasma membrane."

These glycans are linear polymers based on the variably repeating disaccharide unit (uronic acid 1→4 glucosamine)n, where n represents a variably repeating number (typically 10–200). As present in nature, these sugars possess an extensive chemical heterogeneity that is largely attributed to the mosaic arrangement of O- and N-linked sulfates present at different positions along each sugar chain (2.Esko J.D.

Additional structural variations include the presence of N-linked acetates at the glucosamine C2 position as well as epimerization of the uronic acid C5 carboxylate to form either β-d-glucuronic acid or α-l-iduronic acid. Fundamental to understanding HSGAG structure-activity relationships is the appreciation that polydispersity of the glycan fine structure is not random.

Given the utility of other HSGAG-degrading enzymes derived from F. heparinum, including the heparinases as well as the Δ4,5-glycuronidase (17.Myette J.R. Shriver Z. Kiziltepe T. McLean M.W. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7424-7434Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and the 2-O-sulfatase (18.Myette J.R. Shriver Z. Claycamp C. McLean M.W. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12157-12166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), we reasoned that cloning and characterization of additional sulfatases would enable the development of important tools for investigating HSGAG structure. This is especially relevant given extensive experimental evidence that points to the regulated expression of endolytic HSGAG desulfating enzymes (especially 6-O-sulfatase) and their secretion into the extracellular matrix as a mechanism of modulating GAG structures critical for protein interactions (19.Dhoot G.K.

Gallagher J. Werb Z. Rosen S.D. BMC Biochem. 2006; 7: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Therefore, the use of HSGAG degrading enzymes as analytical tools is central to unlocking the structural basis of HSGAG function and their potential use in generating structure-specific, bioactive glycans for therapeutic applications (21.Rusnati M. Oreste P. Zoppetti G. Presta M. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2005; 11: 2489-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To utilize these enzymes correctly and efficiently requires not only a detailed understanding of the biochemistry of these enzymes; it also requires their ample availability for in vitro use. Both of these criteria already have been satisfied in structure-function studies of several HSGAG-related degrading enzymes, such as heparinase I (22.Ernst S. Venkataraman G. Winkler S. Godavarti R. Langer R. Cooney C.L. Sasisekharan R. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 589-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), heparinase II (23.Shaya D. Tocilj A. Li Y. Myette J. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R.

We have been able to clone and identify two additional sulfatases downstream to these enzymes, namely the 6-O-sulfatase and N-sulfamidase. In this study, we report the molecular cloning and recombinant expression in Escherichia coli of the F. heparinum sulfohydrolase, namely the glucosamine 6-O-sulfatase, and in the accompanying manuscript (39.Myette J.R. Soundararajan V. Behr J. Shriver Z. Raman R. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35189-35200Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) we report detailed studies on the N-sulfamidase as well as a model for how the 2-O- and 6-O-sulfatases, and N-sulfamidase work in concert. In both studies, we also present detailed molecular structural modeling and biochemical analyses of the recombinant enzyme as it relates to substrate specificity, optimal reaction conditions, and the role of divalent metal ions in the action of the enzyme. Taken together with our previous studies regarding other members of the heparinase-sulfatase family of enzymes, we have now unraveled the complete framework for HSGAG degradation in F. heparinum. Fluorescent glucopyranoside substrates 4-methyllumbelliferyl-α/β-d-glucopyranoside (4-MU-α-d-Glc and 4-MU-β-d-Glc) were purchased from EMD Biosciences, Inc. (San Diego, CA). 6-O-Sulfated fluorogenic glycopyranoside derivatives were obtained through Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada). Glucosamine and galactosamine monosaccharides, and arylsulfate substrates 4-catechol-sulfate and 4-methyllumbelliferyl-sulfate were purchased from Sigma. Exo-glucosidases were purchased from MP Biomedicals (Irvine, CA). Materials for genomic library construction and screening were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Reagents for site-directed mutagenesis were also obtained from Stratagene. PCR enzymes, TOP10 chemically competent cells, and oligonucleotide primers were obtained from Invitrogen. Additional molecular cloning reagents were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) or the manufacturers listed. The flavobacterial sulfatase gene was cloned by PCR from a λZAPII flavobacterial genomic library originally screened using DNA hybridization probes specific to the 2-O-sulfatase (18.Myette J.R. Shriver Z. Claycamp C. McLean M.W. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12157-12166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Library construction, hybridization screening, and phage excision were as described. An overlapping clone was expanded by chromosomal walking and restriction mapping using the Lambda DASH II genomic cloning kit (Stratagene) for the ligation of size-fractionated genomic DNA (generated by partial Sau3AI digestion). 2-O-Sulfatase-positive clones from an amplified library were plaque purified through three successive rounds, and the DNA were purified from a high titer lysate using standard techniques. For DNA sequencing, recombinant phage DNA was subcloned into pBluescript SK±. The coding sequence of the putative sulfatase gene (described throughout this paper as orfb) was identified by the canonical PFAM (25.Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Howe K.L. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (1223) Google Scholar) sulfatase family identifier (CXPXRXXXXS/TG) and subsequently PCR amplified using the following primer set for orfb (6-O-sulfatase), 5′-GAA TTC ATA TGG GTA AAT TGA AAT TAA TTT TA-3′ (forward) and 5′-GGA TCC TCG AGT TAT AAA GCT TCA GTT GGA TTC GT-3′ (reverse). The amplified gene was subcloned into the T7-based bacterial expression vector pET28a (Novagen) as an NdeI-XhoI cassette (restriction sites underlined). Cloning as such allowed the gene to be expressed as an NH2-terminal His6 fusion with an intervening thrombin cleavage site for facile removal of this tag following protein purification. Recombinant protein expression in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) and one-step affinity purification by nickel chelation chromatography were as described for the 2-O-sulfatase (18.Myette J.R. Shriver Z. Claycamp C. McLean M.W. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12157-12166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The prediction of the NH2-terminal signal sequence and putative cleavage site for the protein was made by the computational method of von Heijne (26.Nielsen H. Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4934) Google Scholar). Engineering and expression of the truncated protein (minus signal sequence) was as described above for the full-length gene with the exception of substituting the 5′ primer that was used in the original PCR amplification step. The internal primer included 5′-TCT AGA CAT ATG TCT TGC CAG CAG CCT AAA C-3′ for orfb with the NdeI site underlined. As such, the orfb gene sequence begins at Met-18. Removal of the His6 tag was achieved by site-specific protease cleavage using the thrombin cleavage capture kit (Novagen). Proteolysis conditions were generally as described for other recombinantly expressed flavobacterial heparin-degrading enzymes (17.Myette J.R. Shriver Z. Kiziltepe T. McLean M.W. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7424-7434Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 18.Myette J.R. Shriver Z. Claycamp C. McLean M.W. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12157-12166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Following concentration of orfb by ultrafiltration, the cleaved protein was dialyzed against 4 liters of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 0.1 m NaCl, 4 °C, overnight using a 3-ml slide-a-lyzer cassette with a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff (Pierce). Final protein concentration was determined calorimetrically using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) and confirmed by UV absorption spectroscopy using theoretical molar extinction coefficients (ϵ280) of 94,730 m−1 (61,572 Da) for the NH2-terminal truncated orfb (6-O-sulfatase). This value was calculated for the thrombin-cleaved protein lacking a His6 purification tag. The enzyme was stored at 4 °C at a concentration of ∼10 mg/ml and full enzyme activity was retained for several months under these conditions. Based on homology modeling of the 6-O-sulfatase (described below), three residues were initially chosen for mutagenesis: Cys-80, Asp-186, and Asp-374. All three residues were mutated to alanines. Site-directed mutagenesis was completed by thermal cycling using the QuikChangeTM method (Stratagene) generally as recommended by the manufacturer. The same pET28 (His6) vector used for bacterial expression of the wild type 6-O-sulfatase was likewise used as the template for linear amplification. The following oligonucleotide primer pairs (forward and reverse) were used: 5′-CTG TTT TGT AAC CAA TGC AGT Tgc CGG GCC ATC CAG GGC TAC-3′, 5′-GTA GCC CTG GAT GGC CCG gcA ACT GCA TTG GTT ACA AAA CAG-3′ (C80A); 5′-C CTT GAA AAA AGG GAC CAT GcT AAA CCC TTT CTG ATG ATT TAC-3′, 5′-G TAA ATC ATC AGA AAG GGT TTA gCA TGG TCC CTT TTT TCA AGG-3′ (D186A); 5′-CC ATT ATT GTC TAT ACT TCC GcT CAG GGC TTT TAT TTG GGT G-3′, 5′-CA CCC AAA TAA AAG CCC TGA gCG GAA GTA TAG ACA ATA ATG G-3′. Base pair changes are noted in lowercase, boldface type. Parental DNA was restricted using DpnI. Mutated DNA was transformed into XL Blue chemically competent cells. Targeted mutations were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing of both strands. Arylsulfatase activity was measured independently using two chromogenic substrates, 4-catechol sulfate and 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate. The catechol substrate assay was conducted generally as described (27.Beil S. Kehrli H. James P. Staudenmann W. Cook A.M. Leisinger T. Kertesz M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 mm substrate was incubated with ∼30 μm recombinant enzyme overnight (12–15 h) at 37 °C in a 100-μl reaction volume that included 50 mm MES, pH 7.0, and 2 mm CaCl2. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 5 μl of 5 m NaOH, and colorimetric activity was determined spectroscopically at 515 nm. The fluorimetric arylsulfatase assay using 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate was as described (28.Morimoto-Tomita M. Uchimura K. Werb Z. Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49175-49185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Reaction conditions included 10 μm enzyme, 2 mm 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0, and 5 mm CaCl2 in a 20-μl reaction volume. Enzyme incubation temperature was 30 °C. Activity was measured as a function of time ranging from 3 to 24 h; the reactions were quenched by the addition of 200 μl of 0.5 m Na2CO3, pH 10.7. Detection of fluorescent methylumbelliferone was measured at this alkaline pH using a SpectraMax microtiter plate reader (GE Healthcare) set at excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 440 nm, respectively. Fluorescence intensity was corrected against background (minus enzyme control). In both assays, 0.5 units of arylsulfatase from Aerobacter aerogenes (Sigma) were used as a positive control. Initial assessment of substrate specificity and pH optima was made using a capillary electrophoresis-based assay for the detection of desulfated products. Preliminary enzyme activity was measured against the following series of fluorescently derivatized, monosulfated gluco- and galactopyranosides: 4-MU-GlcNAc,6S, 4-MU-GlcNS, 4-MU-GalNAc,6S, and 4-MU-Gal6S (where Glc refers to glucosamine and Gal refers to galactose). Standard reactions included 1 mm substrate, 1–10 μm enzyme, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5–6.5, and 5 mm CaCl2 in a 20-μl reaction volume. For the pilot experiment, exhaustive reactions involved overnight incubations at 30 °C. Enzyme was inactivated by heat denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by a 10-fold dilution into water. Reaction products were resolved by capillary electrophoresis using a 25-cm long, 75-μm inner diameter fused silica capillary (Agilent Technologies). Electrophoresis was carried out under negative polarity by applying a voltage of −15 kV (∼1.2 watts) for 10 min. Substrate desulfation was measured as a percentage of substrate depletion relative to a minus enzyme control as monitored by the loss of UV absorbance at 315 nm detected at ∼4 min. A standard capillary electrophoresis buffer included 50 mm Tris and 10 μm dextran sulfate (average molecular mass of 10,000 Da) adjusted to pH 2.0 with phosphoric acid. The effect of pH was likewise measured by capillary electrophoresis using the following three sets of buffers with overlapping pH ranging from 4.5 to 8.0: 50 mm sodium citrate at 4.5, 5.0, and 5.5; 50 mm MES at 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, and 7.0; and 50 mm MOPS at 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0. Reactions included 1 μm enzyme, 2 mm 4-MU-GlcNAc,6S, 50 mm buffer, and 5 mm CaCl2 in a 20-μl reaction volume. Assay was initiated by the addition of 2 μl of a 10× enzyme stock to 18 μl of preheated reaction mixture. Reactions were carried out at 30 °C for 60 min and quenched by heat and dilution as described. The ability of the enzyme to desulfate unsaturated heparin and chondroitin disaccharides was assessed essentially as described for CE-based compositional analyses of enzymatically generated glycosaminoglycan di- and tetrasaccharides (29.Venkataraman G. Shriver Z. Raman R. Sasisekharan R. Science. 1999; 286: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). For these studies, the following disaccharide substrates were tested: ΔUGlcNAc,6S, ΔU2SGlcNAc,6S, ΔUGlcNS, ΔUGlcNS,6S, ΔU2SGlcNS,6S, and ΔUGalNAc,6S. Reactions included 500 μm substrate, 10 μm enzyme, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.5, and ±2 mm CaCl2 in a 20-μl reaction volume. Indirect measurement of enzyme activity was also made using a fluorimetrically based plate assay in which the prerequisite desulfation of the appropriate glucopyranoside 1→4-methlybelliferone substrate by the 6-O-sulfatase was coupled to the glucosidase-mediated hydrolysis of the stereo-specific 1→4-glycosidic linkage between the pyranose ring and the adjoining fluorophore. Release of the free fluorophore (4-MU) was monitored spectroscopically as described above for the arylsulfatase assay using 4-MU sulfate. Hydrolysis of the substrate 4-MU-β-d-GlcNAc,6S at the 6-OH position was coupled to β-glucosidase purified from sweet almonds (MP Biomedicals, catalogue number 195197). The efficacy of the coupled assay was contingent on the intrinsically poor ability that the glucosidase possesses for hydrolyzing the glycosidic bond when the adjoining glucosamine is modified by a sulfate. The presumption of the sulfatase activity being the rate-limiting step was established experimentally. Reaction conditions were optimized to satisfy three criteria: 1) linear readout of the fluorescent signal that was directly proportional to sulfatase activity; 2) quantitative release of 4-MU by glucosidase activity under the biochemical conditions examined; and 3) negligible fluorescent quenching of free chromophore. The standard reaction conditions for the assay included 2 μm recombinant enzyme, 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, and 5 mm CaCl2 in a 20-μl reaction volume. The 4-MU-GlcNAc,6S substrate concentration was varied from 0.1 to 2 mm. Each well of a microtiter plate (prechilled on ice) was treated with 2 μl of enzyme, followed by gentle vortexing of the plate and spin down of the well contents for 1 min at 500 × g and 4 °C. The assay was initiated by transferring the 96-well plate to a heating block preequilibrated at 30 °C. The incubation of the 6-O-sulfatase enzyme was carried out at 30 °C for 20 min, after which the enzyme activity was inactivated by heat denaturation (95 °C, 10 min). For the glucosidase enzyme, the microtiter plate was once again chilled on ice and 40 units of β-glucosidase was added to each well. These were followed by vortex of the plate for mixing and spin down at 500 × g for 1 min at 4 °C. The contents were then transferred to a heating block preequilibrated at 37 °C. Incubation proceeded for 60 min prior to being quenched with 200 μl of 0.5 m Na2CO3, pH 10.7. Reactions were transferred to a black 96-well, flat-bottom fluoroimmunoassay plate and fluorescence measured as described above for the detection of free 4-MU. Fluorescent signal was adjusted to background (minus sulfatase control). For β-glucosidase, this background hydrolysis was somewhat dependent on the initial 4-MU-GlcNAc,6S concentration, but was typically less than 10%. Molar conversion of product was extrapolated from a standard curve generated from various concentrations of 4-MU from 0 to 300 μm. Michaelis-Menten kinetics was extrapolated from Vo versus substrate concentration plots fit by non-linear regression to pseudo-first order kinetics and all obtained data represent the mean of three experimental trials. The coupled enzyme assay was also used for the assessment of enzyme activity for select site-directed mutants. Enzyme activity was measured kinetically using a single saturating concentration (2 mm) of fluorescently labeled substrate. Results are reported as % activity relative to the wild type enzyme. 20 μg of heparin was preincubated with 10 μm 6-O-sulfatase for 8 h at 30 °C in a 20-μl reaction volume that included 25 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0, and 2 mm calcium acetate, pH 7.0. Following this preincubation, the enzyme was inactivated by heat denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, and heparin was exhaustively digested overnight at 37 °C by the addition of 2 μl of a concentrated enzyme mixture containing heparinase I and III. Subsequent CE-based compositional analyses of heparinase-derived disaccharides were completed as described (17.Myette J.R. Shriver Z. Kiziltepe T. McLean M.W. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7424-7434Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry was performed in the negative ion mode using an Agilent 1100 Series VL LC/MSD trap. For simplicity, the samples were prepared by adding MeOH directly to the enzymatic reaction mixtures without purification, and directly injected into the source of the mass spectrometer using a syringe pump at a rate of ∼8 μl/min. The SPS function of the software (LC/MSD Trap Software 4.1 Build 143, MSD Trap Control Version 5.0 Build 65) was used to tune the instrument, with the target mass set to the mass of the substrate, the sample stability set to 50%, and the drive level set to 100%. Data were acquired over the scan range of m/z 100–2200 by accumulating 30,000 ions per scan. Capillary voltage was set to 3000 V. Nitrogen was used as the drying gas, whereas helium was used as the nebulizing gas, with flow rates of 5 and 15 liters/min, respectively. In each case a minimum of 10 spectra were averaged. Substrate specificity was determined using unlabeled glucosamide monosaccharide substrates with various substitutions at the 2-N, 3-OH, and 6-OH positions. Reactions were carried out with 2.5 mm substrate, 5 mm CaCl2, 1 μm enzyme, and 50 mm acetate buffer at pH 5.5 and 37 °C. Reactions were quenched by diluting the samples 1:4 in MeOH. The carrier solvent was H2O:MeOH (1:4, v/v). In the experiments, 4-MU-GlcNS was added prior to injection as the internal standard to monitor ionization and mass accuracy in source and trap.

https://openalex.org/W2059026624,"From Paleo-Indian times to recent historical episodes, the Mesoamerican isthmus played an important role in the distribution and patterns of variability all around the double American continent. However, the amount of genetic information currently available on Central American continental populations is very scarce. In order to shed light on the role of Mesoamerica in the peopling of the New World, the present study focuses on the analysis of the mtDNA variation in a population sample from El Salvador.We have carried out DNA sequencing of the entire control region of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genome in 90 individuals from El Salvador. We have also compiled more than 3,985 control region profiles from the public domain and the literature in order to carry out inter-population comparisons. The results reveal a predominant Native American component in this region: by far, the most prevalent mtDNA haplogroup in this country (at approximately 90%) is A2, in contrast with other North, Meso- and South American populations. Haplogroup A2 shows a star-like phylogeny and is very diverse with a substantial proportion of mtDNAs (45%; sequence range 16090-16365) still unobserved in other American populations. Two different Bayesian approaches used to estimate admixture proportions in El Salvador shows that the majority of the mtDNAs observed come from North America. A preliminary founder analysis indicates that the settlement of El Salvador occurred about 13,400+/-5,200 Y.B.P.. The founder age of A2 in El Salvador is close to the overall age of A2 in America, which suggests that the colonization of this region occurred within a few thousand years of the initial expansion into the Americas.As a whole, the results are compatible with the hypothesis that today's A2 variability in El Salvador represents to a large extent the indigenous component of the region. Concordant with this hypothesis is also the observation of a very limited contribution from European and African women ( approximately 5%). This implies that the Atlantic slave trade had a very small demographic impact in El Salvador in contrast to its transformation of the gene pool in neighbouring populations from the Caribbean facade."
https://openalex.org/W2096370405,"ERK plays an important role in chronic neuropathic pain. However, the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. Here we show that in chronic constriction injury-treated rat spinal cords, up-regulation of SIP30 (SNAP25-interacting protein 30), which is involved in the development and maintenance of chronic constriction injury-induced neuropathic pain, correlates with ERK activation and that the up-regulation of SIP30 is suppressed by intrathecal delivery of the MEK inhibitor U0126. In PC12 cells, up-regulation of SIP30 by nerve growth factor is also dependent on ERK activation. We found that there is an ERK-responsive region in the rat sip30 promoter. Activation of ERK promotes the recruitment of the transcription factor cyclic AMP-response element-binding protein to the sip30 gene promoter. Taken together, our results provide a potential downstream target of ERK activation-mediated neuropathic pain."
https://openalex.org/W2075123002,"Despite the important contribution of cell-cell fusion in the development and physiology of eukaryotes, little is known about the mechanisms that regulate this process. Our study shows that glycosaminoglycans and more specifically heparan sulfate (HS) expressed on the cell surface and extracellular matrix may act as negative regulator of cell-cell fusion. Using herpes simplex virus type-1 as a tool to enhance cell-cell fusion, we demonstrate that the absence of HS expression on the cell surface results in a significant increase in cell-cell fusion. An identical phenomenon was observed when other viruses or polyethylene glycol was used as fusion enhancer. Cells deficient in HS biosynthesis showed increased activity of two Rho GTPases, RhoA and Cdc42, both of which showed a correlation between increased activity and increased cell-cell fusion. This could serve as a possible explanation as to why HS-deficient cells showed significantly enhanced cell-cell fusion and suggests that HS could regulate fusion via fine tuning of RhoA and Cdc42 activities."
https://openalex.org/W2039930630,"Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with gastric adenocarcinoma in some humans, especially those that develop an antecedent condition, chronic atrophic gastritis (ChAG). Gastric epithelial progenitors (GEPs) in transgenic gnotobiotic mice with a ChAG-like phenotype harbor intracellular collections of H. pylori. To characterize H. pylori adaptations to ChAG, we sequenced the genomes of 24 isolates obtained from 6 individuals, each sampled over a 4-year interval, as they did or did not progress from normal gastric histology to ChAG and/or adenocarcinoma. H. pylori populations within study participants were largely clonal and remarkably stable regardless of disease state. GeneChip studies of the responses of a cultured mouse gastric stem cell-like line (mGEPs) to infection with sequenced strains yielded a 695-member dataset of transcripts that are (i) differentially expressed after infection with ChAG-associated isolates, but not with a “normal” or a heat-killed ChAG isolate, and (ii) enriched in genes and gene functions associated with tumorigenesis in general and gastric carcinogenesis in specific cases. Transcriptional profiling of a ChAG strain during mGEP infection disclosed a set of responses, including up-regulation of hopZ, an adhesin belonging to a family of outer membrane proteins. Expression profiles of wild-type and ΔhopZ strains revealed a number of pH-regulated genes modulated by HopZ, including hopP, which binds sialylated glycans produced by GEPs in vivo. Genetic inactivation of hopZ produced a fitness defect in the stomachs of gnotobiotic transgenic mice but not in wild-type littermates. This study illustrates an approach for identifying GEP responses specific to ChAG-associated H. Pylori strains and bacterial genes important for survival in a model of the ChAG gastric ecosystem.

Helicobacter pylori establishes a lifelong infection in most of its human hosts.

The risk for developing cancer is greater if an individual develops chronic atrophic gastritis (ChAG), 3The abbreviations used are: ChAGchronic atrophic gastritisGEPgastric epithelial progenitorBHIbrain heart infusionPBSphosphate-buffered salineOGUoperational gene unitcontiggroup of overlapping nucleotide sequencescfucolony-forming unitsSNPsingle nucleotide polymorphismFDRfalse discovery rate. 3The abbreviations used are: ChAGchronic atrophic gastritisGEPgastric epithelial progenitorBHIbrain heart infusionPBSphosphate-buffered salineOGUoperational gene unitcontiggroup of overlapping nucleotide sequencescfucolony-forming unitsSNPsingle nucleotide polymorphismFDRfalse discovery rate. a histopathologic state characterized in part by loss of acid-producing parietal cells. Several observations have suggested the possibility that this organism may interact directly with gastric stem cells, creating a dangerous liaison that could influence tumorigenesis. First, we have used a germ-free transgenic mouse model of ChAG where parietal cells are eliminated using an attenuated diphtheria toxin A fragment (tox176) expressed under the control of parietal cell-specific regulatory elements from the mouse Atpb4 gene to show that loss of this gastric epithelial lineage is associated with amplification of gastric stem cells expressing NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4-containing glycan receptors recognized by H. pylori adhesins (5Oh J.D. Karam S.M. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 5186-5191Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). H. pylori colonization of these germ-free transgenic mice results in invasion of a subset of gastric epithelial progenitors (GEPs), which harbor small communities of intracellular bacteria weeks to months after a single gavage of bacteria into the stomachs of these animals. This internalization exhibits cellular specificity; it does not occur in the differentiated descendants of GEPs, notably NeuAcα2,3Galβ1,4-expressing, mucus-producing gastric pit cells. The ability to establish residency within GEPs may have implications for tumorigenesis as stem cells are long-lived and have been postulated to be the site of origin for many types of neoplasms (cancer stem cell hypothesis) (6Reya T. Morrison S.J. Clarke M.F. Weissman I.L. Nature. 2001; 414: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (7808) Google Scholar). Second, studies of human gastric biopsies with pre-neoplastic as well as neoplastic changes have revealed intracellular H. pylori (7Necchi V. Candusso M.E. Tava F. Luinetti O. Ventura U. Fiocca R. Ricci V. Solcia E. Gastroenterology. 2007; 132: 1009-1023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Third, we have identified notable differences between H. pylori strains isolated from a single host who progressed from ChAG to gastric adenocarcinoma that may be relevant to initiation and/or progression of carcinogenesis. Both ChAG and cancer-associated strains were able to initially colonize the stomachs of germ-free Atbp4-tox176 mice as indicated by an IgM response, but the ChAG-associated strain was able to maintain a more persistent infection (8Giannakis M. Chen S.L. Karam S.M. Engstrand L. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 4358-4363Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, the cancer-associated strain was more adapted to an intracellular habitat in GEPs. Using a mouse GEP cell line (mGEPs) with a transcriptome that resembles that of laser capture microdissected, Atp4b-tox176-derived GEPs, and that can support attachment, internalization, and intracellular survival of H. pylori, we noted that the cancer strain had a greater invasive capacity (8Giannakis M. Chen S.L. Karam S.M. Engstrand L. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 4358-4363Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Whole genome transcriptional profiling of mGEP and bacterial responses to infection disclosed isolate-specific and progenitor cell-specific molecular phenotypes (a non-progenitor-like mouse gastric epithelial cell line was used as a control in these infection experiments) (8Giannakis M. Chen S.L. Karam S.M. Engstrand L. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 4358-4363Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Compared with the ChAG-associated strain, the cancer strain exhibited increased expression of bacterial ketol-acid reductoisomerase upon mGEP infection, suggesting that it is more able to overcome its requirements for valine and isoleucine by establishing residency within stem cells (8). Infection with the cancer strain also prompted transcriptional changes in mGEP polyamine biosynthetic pathways indicative of augmented production of this class of compounds, which are known to stimulate growth of a variety of bacterial as well as mammalian cell lineages (9Yoshida M. Kashiwagi K. Shigemasa A. Taniguchi S. Yamamoto K. Makinoshima H. Ishihama A. Igarashi K. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 46008-46013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 10Gerner E.W. Meyskens Jr., F.L. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 781-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (874) Google Scholar). Moreover, one of these affected genes, ornithine decarboxylase, exhibits increased expression in gastric adenocarcinomas compared with tissue without metaplasia (11Miao X.P. Li J.S. Li H.Y. Zeng S.P. Zhao Y. Zeng J.Z. World J. Gastroenterol. 2007; 13: 2867-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Finally, infection of mGEPs with the cancer strain resulted in lower levels of expression of several tumor suppressors, including kangai1, whose reduced expression correlates with poorer prognosis in human gastric cancers (12Lee H.S. Lee H.K. Kim H.S. Yang H.K. Kim W.H. J. Pathol. 2003; 200: 39-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Together, these comparative studies of strains, isolated from the same host as they progressed from ChAG to adenocarcinoma, suggest an evolving bacterial-progenitor cell interaction that not only provides a microhabitat for H. pylori in gastric stem cells but also affects the risk for malignant transformation. chronic atrophic gastritis gastric epithelial progenitor brain heart infusion phosphate-buffered saline operational gene unit group of overlapping nucleotide sequences colony-forming units single nucleotide polymorphism false discovery rate. chronic atrophic gastritis gastric epithelial progenitor brain heart infusion phosphate-buffered saline operational gene unit group of overlapping nucleotide sequences colony-forming units single nucleotide polymorphism false discovery rate. The ChAG and cancer strains were obtained from a single individual enrolled in a population-based study, performed a decade ago, that explored the prevalence of peptic ulcer disease in individuals who lived in two northern Swedish cities, Kalix and Haparanda. A subset of enrollees in this “Kalixanda” study (13Aro P. Ronkainen J. Storskrubb T. Bolling-Sternevald E. Carlsson R. Johansson S.E. Vieth M. Stolte M. Engstrand L. Talley N.J. Agréus L. Scand. J.

In this report we now extend our studies of the genomic adaptations of H. pylori to development of ChAG and its interactions with mGEPs. We have done so by sequencing isolates recovered from the body (corpus region) of the stomachs of additional Kalixanda enrollees. Four isolates, two recovered at the time of each endoscopy, were characterized from (i) each of two individuals who maintained normal histology over the four-year interval, (ii) one participant who progressed from normal gastric histology to high grade ChAG, (iii) one person who presented with mild ChAG and then progressed over four years to severe ChAG, (iv) another who had progressed from moderate atrophy to high grade atrophy, and (v) the single patient who had completed the progression from ChAG to adenocarcinoma. Gene and SNP content were compared in the sequenced microbial genomes, and the resulting datasets were used to determine the extent of genome-wide diversity and whether the genomes cluster according to host and/or host pathologic status. A subset of 6 strains was culled from this collection of 24 isolates, and together with HPAG1, a previously sequenced ChAG strain from another independent clinical study (15Enroth H. Kraaz W. Engstrand L. Nyrén O. Rohan T. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2000; 9: 981-985PubMed Google Scholar), were used for GeneChip-based functional genomics analyses to define a shared mGEP response to ChAG-associated isolates. Finally, whole genome transcriptional profiling of the HPAG1 strain grown under various pH conditions in vitro and during its infection of mGEPs was used to identify an outer membrane bacterial protein that plays an important role in colonization of Atpb4-tox176 mice. H. pylori strain HPAG1 was obtained from a patient with ChAG in a Swedish case-control study of gastric cancer (15Enroth H. Kraaz W. Engstrand L. Nyrén O. Rohan T. Cancer Epidemiol. Biomarkers Prev. 2000; 9: 981-985PubMed Google Scholar). Strains recovered from participants enrolled in the Kalixanda study are listed in Table 1. Bacteria were grown under microaerophilic conditions for 48–72 h at 37 °C on brain heart infusion (BHI) agar plates supplemented with 10% calf blood, vancomycin (6 μg/ml), trimethoprim (5 μg/ml), and amphotericin B (8 μg/ml). For liquid culture, bacteria were grown in Brucella or BHI broth supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Sigma) and 1% IsoVitaleX (BD Biosciences), pH 7.0.TABLE 1List of H. pylori strains sequenced and histologic features of the corpus region of their host gastric habitatPatient IDAgeaAge at initial endoscopy./genderGastric histopathologyt = 0t = 4 years125967/maleNormal to normalHPKX_1259_NL0C1HPKX_1259_NL4C1HPKX_1259_NL0C2HPKX_1259_NL4C2137970/femaleNormal to normalHPKX_1379_NL0C1HPKX_1379_NL4C1HPKX_1379_NL0C2HPKX_1379_NL4C234565/maleNormal (0) to high grade (3) atrophyHPKX_345_NL0C1HPKX_345_AG4C1HPKX_345_NL0C2HPKX_345_AG4C2103968/maleSlight atrophy (grade 1) to high grade (3) atrophyHPKX_1039_AG0C1HPKX_1039_AG4C1HPKX_1039_AG0C2HPKX_1039_AG4C2117270/maleModerate atrophy (grade 2) to high grade (3) atrophyHPKX_1172_AG0C1HPKX_1172_AG4C1HPKX_1172_AG0C2HPKX_1172_AG4C243875/maleModerate atrophy (grade 2) to gastric cancerHPKX_438_AG0C1HPKX_438_CA4C1HPKX_438_AG0C2HPKX_438_CA4C2a Age at initial endoscopy. Open table in a new tab The hopZ gene was amplified from strain HPAG1 using primers HopZ-F (GTGAAAAACACCGGCGAATTGA) and HopZ-R (CGGAGTTGAAAAAGCTGGATTTGAT), cloned into pCR®4TOPO® (Invitrogen), and then subcloned into pGEM®-5Zf(+) (Promega) using SpeI and NotI sites. hopZ was disrupted by insertion of the kanamycin resistance cassette of pJMK30 (59Ferrero R.L. Cussac V. Courcoux P. Labigne A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4212-4217Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into a HindIII site. The hopZ::KanR construct was electroporated into the recipient HPAG1 strain. Bacteria were plated on BHI agar plates, grown for 3 days, harvested, resuspended in PBS, and then plated on BHI agar containing 50 mg/ml kanamycin to select for transformants. Correct insertion of the kanamycin cassette was confirmed by PCR, sequencing, and Southern blot hybridization. Genomic DNA was prepared according to Oh et al. (39Oh J.D. Kling-Bäckhed H. Giannakis M. Xu J. Fulton R.S. Fulton L.A. Cordum H.S. Wang C. Elliott G. Edwards J. Mardis E.R. Engstrand L.G. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 9999-10004Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Standard Illumina genomic sequencing protocols were employed. In general, one lane of an eight-lane flow cell in an Illumina GA-I or GA-II sequencer was used for each strain. However, an additional lane of sequencing was done for genomes with poor assemblies (total assembly length <1 Mbp or N50 contig length <1500 bp). The Velvet assembler (17Zerbino D.R. Birney E. Genome Res. 2008; 18: 821-829Crossref PubMed Scopus (7337) Google Scholar) was used for sequence assembly. All combinations of k (the word length for velveth) between 19 and 31 and minimum coverage (the -cov_cutoff option for velvetg) between 6 and 40 were tested. The best combination was manually chosen for each data set to maximize N50 contig length, total assembly length, and k in that order. A high coverage cutoff (the -max_coverage option for velvetg) was chosen manually from a weighted histogram of the number of nucleotides versus coverage reported by Velvet, generated as described in the appendix of the Velvet manual (the high coverage cutoff was chosen by visual inspection to include only the largest peak in the coverage histogram). Genes were predicted using Glimmer in each assembled data set. All predicted coding sequences <300 nucleotides were filtered out (this reduced the false positive rate and increased the false negative rate only mildly). These genes were added to the pan-genome generated from published genome sequences and the nr data base as described in the “Comparisons of H. pylori Genomes” section under “Results and Discussion.” This entire set of genes was binned (clustered) using the CD-HIT program with default parameters into OGUs. If any predicted gene from an assembled genome was present in a given OGU (cluster), that OGU was called as present within that genome. The method used for “raw read” OGU calling (as opposed to “assembled data” OGU calling) is described in the “Comparisons of H. pylori Genomes” section below. The pan-genome used for the raw read analysis encompased all Glimmer-predicted genes, including those <300 bp. All sequences in all OGUs predicted for each genome using the raw read method were aligned to the COG or KEGG data base using BLASTX. Each OGU was assigned the union of the COG categories or KEGG pathways matching its constituent sequences (with few (<5%) exceptions, all sequences within a single OGU matched the same COG category or KEGG pathway). Comparisons of fractional representation of COG and KEGG pathways between different gene sets (i.e. core versus variable genes) were done using a χ2 goodness-of-fit test; categories or pathways with less than 5 genes in either “core” gene sets (i.e. represented in all sequenced H. pylori genomes) or “variable” gene sets (not represented in all genomes) were excluded from the χ2 test. A post hoc Z-test on residuals was used to determine which categories or pathways contributed to significant differences, with a cutoff set at 3 S.D., corresponding to an unadjusted type I error rate of 0.0013. HPAG1 was used as a reference genome. Each assembled genome was aligned using BLASTN against HPAG1. Only the first alignment reported by BLASTN was used for each assembled contig. The position of each SNP (based on the HPAG1 genome sequence) was recorded. A gap was counted as 1 SNP. The SNPs for each assembled genome was then represented as a vector of 1 (SNP present) or 0 (no SNP or no alignment) with 1,596,366 elements (the length of the HPAG1 genome). SNP rates were calculated for each pair of assembled genomes by counting the number of sequence differences only at positions in the HPAG1 reference genome where the both genomes had contigs that aligned. The total number of sequence differences in overlapping regions was divided by the total length of overlapping alignments, giving a rate of SNPs per aligned base pair. For a given gene, using the fully sequenced HPAG1 genome as a reference, a set of all orthologous sequences from the Illumina data sets was collected. Orthology was defined as a reciprocal best BLAST hit; i.e. using the HPAG1 sequence for a gene, the best BLASTN hit from an assembled genome was extracted and compared back to the HPAG1 genome using BLASTN and BLASTX. Only sequences that mapped back to the original HPAG1 gene sequence were used. The set of orthologs for a given gene was analyzed for positive selection according to Chen et al. (54Chen S.L. Hung C.S. Xu J. Reigstad C.S. Magrini V. Sabo A. Blasiar D. Bieri T. Meyer R.R. Ozersky P. Armstrong J.R. Fulton R.S. Latreille J.P. Spieth J. Hooton T.M. Mardis E.R. Hultgren S.J. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 5977-5982Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Specifically, each ortholog set was aligned as translated protein sequence using ClustalW (60Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55409) Google Scholar); the alignment was imposed on the DNA sequences. Aligned DNA sequences were trimmed to the shortest sequence in the data set (so there were no gaps at the ends of the alignments). The GENECONV program (61Sawyer S. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1989; 6: 526-538PubMed Google Scholar) was used to detect recombination; alignments that had a p value of less than 0.05 were split into fragments based on the recombination breakpoints identified by GENECONV. Each alignment or fragment alignment was then used to infer a maximum likelihood tree using the DNAML program from PHYLIP, then tested for positive selection using the M1 and M2 models of CODEML from the PAML package (Version 4) (62Yang Z. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2007; 24: 1586-1591Crossref PubMed Scopus (8082) Google Scholar). M1 is the null model that does not include positive selection. M2 is the test model that includes positive selection. An unadjusted p value cutoff of 0.05 was used for each gene. mGEP cells (8Giannakis M. Chen S.L. Karam S.M. Engstrand L. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 4358-4363Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) were seeded (passage number 4–7) at 4 × 105 cells per T75 flask in 12–15 ml of RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma, pH 7.1–7.2) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and grown for 3 days at 37 °C to 70% confluency. Medium was then removed. H. pylori strains, which had been grown to log phase A600 ≈ 0.8 in Brucella broth plus 5% fetal bovine serum and 1% IsoVitaleX, were spun down, washed in PBS, resuspended in fresh cell culture medium, and added to the flasks (1.6 × 107–5 × 109 bacteria/flask). After a 24-h incubation at 37 °C, residual medium and non-attached bacteria were washed off from mGEPs using PBS (2 times; 25 °C), and cells were harvested by trypsinization (5 min at 37 °C; 0.05% trypsin (Sigma); 0.02% EDTA). After neutralization with ice-cold medium and a PBS wash, cells were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. As controls, mGEP cells alone were incubated for 24 h in culture medium under the same conditions and underwent identical treatments as the infected samples. Alternatively, bacteria were heat-killed by incubation at 95–100 °C for 5 min. The heat-treated cultures were subcultured on BHI plates at 37 °C for 96 h to prove that no viable organisms remained. mGEP infections with heat-killed bacteria were carried out as described above. All infections were performed in triplicate/strain. Total cellular RNA was then extracted using the RNeasy mini-prep kit (Qiagen), and contaminating genomic DNA was removed using the DNA-free kit (Ambion) as described by the manufacturer. Biotinylated and fragmented cRNAs prepared from total cellular mGEP RNA were hybridized to Moe430_2 Affymetrix Gene Chips. Raw data were normalized with RMA (63Irizarry R.A. Bolstad B.M. Collin F. Cope L.M. Hobbs B. Speed T.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: e15Crossref PubMed Scopus (4004) Google Scholar). Z-score-based p values were calculated for each gene based on the mean and S.D. of the gene across all experiments in a set of 12 control microarrays of uninfected mGEPs. FDR was estimated using the Benjamini and Hochberg procedure (64Benjamini Y. Hochberg Y. J. R. Stat. Soc. Series B Stat. Methodol. 1995; 57: 289-300Google Scholar). Overnight liquid cultures of HPAG1 and the isogenic ΔhopZ mutant were grown to A600 of 0.5–0.7. Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 ml of BHI broth, pH 7.0, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% IsovitaleX to yield a starting A600 ≈ 0.05. Growth was subsequently monitored at 37 °C over a 50-h period. Overnight liquid cultures of HPAG1 and HPAG1ΔhopZ (A600 = 0.5–0.7) were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 50 ml of BHI broth, pH 7.0, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% IsovitaleX to yield a starting A600 of 0.05. Cultures were grown for 25 h to mid-log phase (A600 ≈ 0.5). At this point hydrochloric acid was added to half of the culture to lower the pH to 5.0, whereas the other half remained at pH 7.0. Aliquots (4 ml) were collected from both these cultures after 1 h of growth, yielding 2 samples for RNA isolation (pH 5.0 and 7.0). Samples were immediately placed in 2 volumes of RNAprotect bacteria reagent (Qiagen). The solution was mixed by vortexing for 10 s, incubated at room temperature for 5 min, and then centrifuged (3500 × g for 15 min at 22 °C). The resulting pellet was stored at −80 °C until RNA was isolated. The acid exposure experiment was done in triplicate. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen). Cell pellets were resuspended in 200 μl of TE buffer (10 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 1 mg/ml lysozyme (specific activity, 50,000 units/mg; Sigma), incubated in room temperature for 20 min, and vortexed every 3 min. Genomic DNA was removed by on-column DNase digestion using RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen) as described by the manufacturer. To analyze the responses of the wild-type HPAG1 and ΔhopZ isogenic strains to low pH in vitro, cDNA targets were prepared from 8–10-μg aliquots of each bacterial RNA sample using protocols described in the Escherichia coli Antisense Genome Array manual (Affymetrix). To analyze the bacterial transcriptome after a 24-h infection of mGEP cells, we used 25–43 mg of total RNA; each sample contained 8–10 mg of bacterial RNA based on quantification of the mammalian/bacterial 18 S to 16 S rRNA ratio using RNA 6000 Pico LabChips and a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies). RNA was reverse-transcribed using random primers and Superscript-II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and the RNA template was removed by incubation with 0.25 n NaOH for 30 min at 65 °C. The cDNA product was isolated (QiaQuick Spin columns; Qiagen), fragmented using DNase-I (Amersham Biosciences), and biotinylated (Enzo-BioArray Terminal Labeling kit). Standard Affymetrix protocols were used for hybridization of each cDNA target to a custom Affymetrix H. pylori HPAG1 GeneChip (Hp-AG78a520172F). GeneChip data were normalized with RMA. FDR was estimated using the Benjamini and Hochberg procedure (64Benjamini Y. Hochberg Y. J. R. Stat. Soc. Series B Stat. Methodol. 1995; 57: 289-300Google Scholar). Functional enrichment was calculated using a hypergeometric distribution. COG functions and GO terms were assigned to genes by BLAST (for COG, eval <10E-10 using STRING data base Version 7.1) and with hmmpfam (for GO terms using TIGRFAM Version 8.0 and PFAM Version 23). mGEP cells were seeded in 24-well plates (Corning; 1 × 105 cells/well) and cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) for 24 h under an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C. Wild-type HPAG1 and the ΔhopZ mutant strain were grown overnight, separately, in Brucella medium, pH 7.0 (supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 1% IsovitaleX), harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in RPMI1640 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. 2.5 × 108 cfu of wild-type HPAG1, and an equivalent amount of the isogenic ΔhopZ mutant was added to each well at 37 °C. Three hours later, cells were washed with PBS (4 times; 25 °C) to remove non-attached bacteria and then incubated with fresh medium for 21 h at 37 °C. Cells were washed with PBS (3 times; 25 °C), fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min, washed with PBS (3 times; 25 °C), incubated with PBS containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (blocking buffer) for 15 min, and attached extracellular bacteria marked with rabbit polyclonal antibodies to H. pylori surface proteins (DAKO, 1:1000 dilution; overnight incubation in blocking buffer at 4 °C). Bound antibodies were incubated with biotin-tagged anti-rabbit Ig (1:500; 1 h at 25 °C). After washing (3× in PBS, 5 min/cycle at 25 °C) to remove unbound antibodies, mGEP cells in some wells were permeabilized (1% saponin (Sigma), 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS; 15 min at 37 °C). Antibodies to H. pylori were added (DAKO; 1 h at 25 °C, 1:1000 dilution) to label both extra- and intracellular bacteria, and bacteria were visualized with streptavidin-Alexa-Fluor 350 (blue) and Cy3 (red)-tagged donkey anti-rabbit Ig (1:500; 1 h at 25 °C). Intracellular bacteria were defined as those that were only stained with Cy3 and not with Alexa-Fluor 350. Alexa-Fluor 488-phalloidin (Molecular Probes; 1:500) was used to label actin"
https://openalex.org/W2119368454,"The translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO), also known as peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor, is directly or indirectly associated with many biological processes. Although extensively characterized, the specific function of TSPO during development remains unclear. It has been reported that TSPO is involved in a variety of mechanisms, including cell proliferation, apoptosis, regulation of mitochondrial functions, cholesterol transport and steroidogenesis, and porphyrin transport and heme synthesis. Although the literature has reported a murine knockout model, the experiment did not generate information because of early lethality. We then used the zebrafish model to address the function of tspo during development. Information about spatiotemporal expression showed that tspo has a maternal and a zygotic contribution which, during somatogenesis, seems to be erythroid restricted to the intermediate cell mass. Genetic and pharmacological approaches used to invalidate Tspo function resulted in embryos with specific erythropoietic cell depletion. Although unexpected, this lack of blood cells is independent of the Tspo cholesterol binding site and reveals a new in vivo key role for Tspo during erythropoiesis."
https://openalex.org/W2065688292,"CcpN, a transcriptional repressor from Bacillus subtilis that is responsible for the carbon catabolite repression of three genes, has been characterized in detail in the past 4 years. However, nothing is known about the actual repression mechanism as yet. Here, we present a detailed study on how CcpN exerts its repression effect at its three known target promoters of the genes sr1, pckA, and gapB. Using gel shift assays under non-repressive and repressive conditions, we showed that CcpN and RNA polymerase can bind simultaneously and that CcpN does not prevent RNA polymerase (RNAP) binding to the promoter. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of CcpN on open complex formation and demonstrate that CcpN also does not act at this step of transcription initiation at the sr1 and pckA and presumably at the gapB promoter. Investigation of abortive transcript synthesis revealed that CcpN acts differently at the three promoters: At the sr1 and pckA promoter, promoter clearance is impeded by CcpN, whereas synthesis of abortive transcripts is repressed at the gapB promoter. Eventually, we demonstrated with Far Western blots and co-elution experiments that CcpN is able to interact with the RNAP α-subunit, which completes the picture of the requirements for the repressive action of CcpN. On the basis of the presented results, we propose a new working model for CcpN action.

CcpN, a transcriptional repressor from Bacillus subtilis, mediates CcpA-independent carbon catabolite repression of at least three genes: sr1, encoding a small RNA and pckA and gapB (1Fillinger S.

Since its discovery in 2005, CcpN has been thoroughly investigated. Binding properties and binding motifs were examined, revealing that CcpN possesses two asymmetric binding sites that are bound cooperatively and positioned differently at the three regulated promoters (5Licht A. Brantl S. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 434-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar): At the sr1 promoter, binding sites are located upstream of the −35 region and between the −35 and the −10 region, while binding sites cover the −35 as well as the −10 region at the pckA promoter. One operator at the gapB promoter overlaps the −10 region, the second one is located around +20. ATP and low pH have been identified as signals required for CcpN-mediated repression (6Licht A. Golbik R. Brantl S. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 17-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and the detailed biophysical properties of CcpN-DNA interaction have been reported (7Zorrilla S.

In addition, it has been shown that CcpN controls central carbon fluxes in the metabolism of B. subtilis and that the growth defect of CcpN knock-out mutants is caused by ATP dissipation via extensive futile cycling (8Tännler S. Fischer E. Le Coq D. Doan T. Jamet E. Sauer U. Aymerich S. J. Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 6178-6187Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that a CcpN knock-out is able to increase the industrial production of riboflavin in B. subtilis by a deregulation of the gapB gene (9Tännler S. Zamboni N. Kiraly C. Aymerich S. Sauer U. Metab. Eng. 2008; 10: 216-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). However, nothing is known about the actual repression mechanism of CcpN as yet. Initiation of transcription is a stepwise process (10Record Jr., M.T. Reznikoff W.S. Craig M.L. McQuade K.L. Schlax P.J. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. American Society for Microbiology, Washington DC1996Google Scholar), beginning with binding of RNA polymerase (RNAP) 2The abbreviations used are: RNAPRNA polymeraseNTAnitrilotriacetic acidDEPCdiethylpyrocarbonate. 2The abbreviations used are: RNAPRNA polymeraseNTAnitrilotriacetic acidDEPCdiethylpyrocarbonate. to the promoter and formation of a loose closed complex, which is then rearranged into a tighter closed complex. This is followed by the melting of DNA around the transcriptional start site, called the open complex. RNAP can subsequently form the initiation complex and begin to transcribe the DNA, often producing short abortive transcripts resulting from failed attempts to leave the promoter. Eventually, RNAP escapes the promoter and forms the elongation complex. Transcriptional repressors can act at any of these steps, beginning with steric hindrance of RNAP binding, like the Fur protein of Escherichia coli (11Escolar L. Pérez-Martín J. de Lorenzo V. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 2579-2582Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) over the inhibition of open complex formation, like B. subtilis Spo0A at the abrB promoter (12Greene E.A. Spiegelman G.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11455-11461Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) to the prevention of promoter clearance, as observed with the phage Φ29 protein p4 at the viral A2c promoter (13Monsalve M. Mencía M. Salas M. Rojo F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 8913-8918Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).

RNA polymerase nitrilotriacetic acid diethylpyrocarbonate. RNA polymerase nitrilotriacetic acid diethylpyrocarbonate. Whereas steric hindrance of RNA polymerase binding does not involve direct repressor-RNAP contacts, repression of other steps in the transcription initiation process often does. In most of those cases, contacts between a transcriptional repressor and the C-terminal domain of the α-subunit of RNAP are described, as for the p4 protein at the A2c promoter or for the repressor Spx from B. subtilis (13Monsalve M. Mencía M. Salas M. Rojo F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1996; 93: 8913-8918Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 15Zhang Y. Nakano S. Choi S.Y. Zuber P. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 4300-4311Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, interactions with other subunits of RNAP have also been proposed, for example for the Rsd protein of E. coli or the main carbon catabolite mediator of B. subtilis, CcpA (16Ilag L.L. Westblade L.F. Deshayes C. Kolb A. Busby S.J. Robinson C.V. Structure. 2004; 12: 269-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kim J.H. Yang Y.K. Chambliss G.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A special case of repressors that interact with RNA polymerase subunits are anti-σ-factors. These proteins can sequester free σ-factor and are thus able to influence the expression of whole regulons (18Hughes K.T. Methee K. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1998; 52: 231-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar, 19Campbell E.A. Westblade L.F. Darst S.A. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2008; 11: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In this work, we present a detailed analysis of the action of CcpN at all steps of transcription initiation and show that it prevents promoter clearance at the sr1 and pckA promoter, while displaying a rare effect at the gapB promoter: It allows the formation of the open complex, but prevents the synthesis of abortive transcripts. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CcpN is able to interact with the α-subunit of RNAP and probably regulates the sr1 and pckA promoters this way. Eventually, we present a new working model for CcpN-mediated transcriptional repression in regard to the specific operator positions and promoter sequences. B. subtilis strain NIG2001 was used for expression of His-tagged B. subtilis RNA polymerase (20Fujita M. Sadaie Y. Gene. 1998; 221: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and strain DB104 (21Kawamura F. Doi R.H. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 442-444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used for the preparation of B. subtilis protein crude extracts. E. coli strain TG1 (pREP4, pQGDR) was used for overexpression and purification of CcpN-His5 and strain BL21 (DE3) (pETSigA) was used for overexpression and purification of His-tagged B. subtilis SigA (4Licht A. Preis S. Brantl S. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 189-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 22Fujita M. Sadaie Y. J. Biochem. 1998; 124: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). All strains were grown in TY medium (16 g Bacto tryptone, 10 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl in 1 liter) with the respective antibiotics. CcpN overexpression and purification with a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-agarose column and by anion exchange chromatography was performed as published before (6Licht A. Golbik R. Brantl S. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 380: 17-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of His-tagged B. subtilis RNA polymerase and His-tagged SigA with a Ni2+-NTA-agarose column was carried out according to the protocols established by Fujita and Sadaie (20Fujita M. Sadaie Y. Gene. 1998; 221: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Fujita M. Sadaie Y. J. Biochem. 1998; 124: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Binding reactions were performed in a final volume of 10 μl in either 0.5× TBE and 10 mm MgCl2 for the formation of closed complexes or in in vitro transcription buffer (40 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.3, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 100 mm potassium acetate, and 20% glycerol) for the formation of open complexes, 0.05 g/liter herring sperm DNA as nonspecific competitor, and 1 nm end-labeled DNA fragment. Where indicated, 3 μm CcpN-His5, 3 μm RNAP-His6, 3 mm ATP, HCl to a final pH of 6.5 or 0.1 g/liter of heparin were added. After incubation at 37 °C for 15 min, the reaction mixtures were denatured and separated on 5% native polyacrylamide gels run at room temperature for 1 h at 230 V. Gels were dried and subjected to PhosphorImaging (Fujix BAS 1000). Binding reactions were performed in a final volume of 10 μl in 50 mm sodium-cacodylate buffer (pH 7.3) using 1 nm of an end-labeled DNA fragment. Where indicated, 100 nm CcpN-His5, 100 nm of native RNAP, 3 mm ATP, and/or HCl to a final pH of 6.5 were added. After 15 min of incubation at 37 °C, 1 μl of DEPC (final concentration of 10%) was added, and the reaction was incubated at 37 °C for another 10 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of stop solution (1.5 m NaAc, 0.1 g/liter tRNA) and precipitated with ethanol, followed by dissolving of the pellet in 10% piperidine and cleavage at the modified sites for 30 min at 90 °C. Subsequently, the cleavage reaction was precipitated with ethanol again, and the pellet dissolved in formamide loading dye to a final activity of 2000 cpm/μl. Afterwards, 3 μl were denatured and separated on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. Gels were dried and subjected to PhosphorImaging. In vitro transcription reactions at the pckA and gapB promoters were performed in a final volume of 20 μl in in vitro transcription buffer in the presence of 3 mm ATP, 0.1 mm CTP, and GTP, 0.01 mm UTP, and 0.011 μm [α-32P]UTP. For the sr1 promoter, 0.1 mm UTP and 0.011 μm [α-32P]ATP were used to allow detection of abortive transcripts. Where indicated, HCl to a final pH of 6.5 and CcpN-His5 were added, followed by 100 nm double-stranded DNA template and 100 nm RNAP-His6. The reaction was gently mixed and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Half of the reaction was ethanol-precipitated with potassium acetate to keep unincorporated [α-32P]NTPs in solution and then dissolved in 10 μl of distilled water. One volume of formamide loading dye was added to each half of the reaction, followed by denaturation for 5 min at 90 °C, quick cooling on ice, and analysis on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel to detect full-length transcripts or on a 23% denaturing polyacrylamide gel to detect abortive transcripts. Electrophoresis was performed at 300 V/25 mA for 50 min. Gels were dried and subjected to PhosphorImaging. For Western blotting, samples were separated on a 15.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subsequently blotted using polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Carl Roth). A polyclonal antiserum from rabbit against CcpN-His5 as primary antibody and horseradish peroxidase-coupled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) was used, both with a dilution of 1:2000. Blots were developed by diaminobenzidine reaction, digitized with a ScanPrisa 640U (Acer) scanner, and analyzed with TINA-PC BAS 2.08e software. For Far Western blotting, two identical sets of protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and subsequently blotted. SDS was then removed from the blot membranes by washing with PBST. After blocking, the part of the membranes containing the first set of samples was incubated with blocking buffer again for 1 h at room temperature, while the membrane containing the other set was incubated with 200 nm CcpN-His5 in blocking buffer. Both membranes were then washed with PBST and incubated with primary and secondary antibody as described in the Western blotting procedure. B. subtilis DB104 was grown to an A560 of 4 in 150 ml of TY medium, cells were harvested, resuspended in 15 ml of PBS and sonicated three times for 10 min. 180 μl of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (17 g/liter in isopropanol) were added prior to sonication. After centrifugation at 4 °C, the supernatant was obtained and incubated with 300 nm of purified RpoA-His6, SigA-His6 or without any protein for 1 h at room temperature. The samples were then purified using a Ni2+-NTA-agarose column, and the eluates analyzed on a 15.5% PAA-SDS-gel. Transcriptional repressors can act during a variety of different steps in transcription initiation. To investigate whether CcpN exerts its repression effect by preventing RNA polymerase binding to the promoter, we performed gel shift assays using 89-bp end-labeled double-stranded DNA fragments carrying the sr1, pckA, gapB, or RNAIII (as a negative control that is unable to bind CcpN) promoters (Fig. 1). Purified CcpN-His5 and purified His-tagged B. subtilis RNA polymerase alone and together were incubated with the labeled DNA fragment and complex formation was analyzed on native polyacrylamide gels. The presence of CcpN or RNA polymerase alone resulted in a single band corresponding to the respective protein-DNA complex at all three promoters. When both proteins were present, an additional band was visible at all three promoters, emerging from a complex of DNA, CcpN, and RNA polymerase. As expected, the control promoter of RNAIII showed only a single band corresponding to an RNAP-DNA complex, but no CcpN-DNA complex. All experiments were performed under non-repressive (0 mm ATP, pH 7.3) and under repressive conditions (3 mm ATP, pH 6.5) to assay whether CcpN is able to prevent RNA polymerase binding to the promoter sequence. For analysis under repressive conditions, both ATP and low pH were also present in the gel and in the running buffer to ensure that the conditions did not change during electrophoresis. At all three promoters, the band representing the CcpN-RNAP-DNA complex did not change in intensity when comparing non-repressive with repressive conditions, indicating that CcpN is not able to prevent the formation of the closed complex. The next step in transcription initiation is the formation of the open complex, involving melting of the DNA at the promoter region. To detect formation of an open complex, a double-stranded DNA fragment was probed for the presence of single-stranded regions under different conditions using DEPC (Fig. 2), which is known to react preferentially with single-stranded regions in B-form DNA (23Scholten P.M. Nordheim A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 3981-3993Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Usually KMnO4 is used for detection of single-stranded regions, but did not work under our buffer conditions. Therefore, DEPC was used, although it has the disadvantage of producing weaker signals at stacked adenosine residues. As shown in Fig. 2, signals emerged at all three promoters upon addition of RNA polymerase that were not present in the negative control, where only DEPC was added. These signals persisted in the presence of CcpN (non-repressive conditions) as well as in the presence of CcpN, ATP and low pH (repressive conditions) at all investigated promoters. Thus, one can conclude that CcpN is not able to prevent formation of the open complex at any of the three promoters. To corroborate these findings, another assay for open complex formation using heparin as a probe has been performed, mainly confirming the results of the DEPC probing. Interestingly, the amount of RNAP-DNA complex decreases significantly upon heparin addition at the gapB promoter, indicating that RNAP does not seem to be able to be efficiently converted into a stable open complex. However, the fraction of stable complex that is formed cannot be destabilized by CcpN even under repressive conditions. Because formation of the open complex is not impeded by CcpN at any promoter, it can either prevent the synthesis of abortive transcripts or promoter clearance. To investigate this issue, in vitro transcription reactions under non-repressive and repressive conditions were performed and analyzed on two different denaturing polyacrylamide gels: 6% gels were used to detect full-length transcripts while 23% gels were used to detect abortive transcripts (Fig. 3). Because there is no uridine within the first 11 bases of the sr1 transcript, [α-32P]ATP instead of UTP was used for labeling. This resulted in very faint bands for both the full-length and the abortive transcripts, because all in vitro transcription reactions were performed in the presence of 3 mm ATP necessary to observe the repressive effect of CcpN. To ensure that the observed abortive transcripts are produced by the analyzed promoters rather than non-promoter sites on the template, templates with mutated promoters were investigated (Fig. 3). Indeed, certain transcripts within the expected size of 3–11 nt are no longer produced from the mutated fragments, indicating that they emerge from the investigated promoters. At all three promoters, formation of full-length or abortive transcripts was not influenced in the presence of CcpN or low pH alone. Fig. 3A shows that abortive transcripts are produced at the sr1 promoter in all four lanes, even under repressive conditions, while synthesis of the full-length transcript is significantly repressed in the presence of CcpN, ATP, and low pH. At the pckA promoter, most of the abortive transcripts are still produced during CcpN-mediated repression, however, the smallest two transcripts are lost. Nevertheless, Fig. 3B clearly shows that abortive transcription in general is not affected by CcpN. A completely different picture can be found at the gapB promoter (Fig. 3C). Here, bands corresponding to abortive transcripts are hardly or not at all detectable under repressive conditions. Thus, one can conclude that CcpN acts at the sr1 and pckA promoters by preventing RNA polymerase from leaving the promoter and proceeding with transcription, while still allowing the production of short abortive transcripts. At the gapB promoter, on the contrary, CcpN appears to impede transcription initiation itself, resulting in the inability to produce abortive transcripts. However, the conversion from closed to open complex at this promoter is inefficient under our experimental condition. Thus, it is possible that CcpN acts as an inhibitor of open complex formation under conditions where the closed to open complex transition is more efficient. Because CcpN is able to prevent RNA polymerase from leaving the promoter, we wanted to find out whether this is due to a direct interaction. To this end, we purified the RNA polymerase α-subunit (RpoA) as well as the B. subtilis major σ-factor SigA. Fig. 4A shows the two proteins, along with BSA and purified CcpN. While SigA is apparently pure, the α-subunit contains some impurities, although in a much lower concentration than the protein itself. Two gels with identical protein samples have subsequently been subjected to far Western blotting to analyze possible interactions between CcpN and these proteins (Fig. 4B). The left panel shows the control blot that was only incubated with primary (anti-CcpN) and secondary antibody. As expected, CcpN itself produced a very strong signal, indicating that the antibodies work as intended. However, there are also two signals in the lane with the RpoA preparation: A very intensive signal corresponding to the largest impurity, indicating extensive antibody cross-reaction and a weak signal at the 27 kDa impurity. The RpoA band itself did not produce a signal, demonstrating that the anti-CcpN-antibody did not bind to it unspecifically. Furthermore, there were no antibody cross reactions with either SigA or bovine serum albumin. The right panel shows the experiment itself, where the blot has been incubated with CcpN before the application of the first antibody. Strikingly, a band emerges that corresponds exactly to the 39-kDa band comprised of RpoA, indicating that CcpN is able to specifically interact with the RNA polymerase α-subunit. Neither SigA nor bovine serum albumin showed any interaction with CcpN at all. To corroborate these findings, we investigated whether CcpN can be co-eluted with an α-subunit preparation. To this end, a crude extract of B. subtilis DB104 was incubated with RpoA-His6 and subsequently purified using a Ni2+-NTA-agarose column. As controls, RpoA-His6 alone, the crude extract alone as well a crude extract preincubated with SigA-His6 was purified in the same manner. Fig. 4C shows the results of these experiments. It can be clearly seen that only in the case where the crude extract was preincubated with RpoA, a new band emerges that corresponds to native CcpN. As expected, this band runs marginally faster than the purified CcpN because of the lack of the His tag used for CcpN purification. Taking these results and the far Western blot together, one can conclude that CcpN is able to specifically interact with the α-subunit of RNA polymerase. Here, we report the elucidation of the repression mechanism employed by the transcriptional repressor CcpN from B. subtilis. Gel shift assays demonstrated that CcpN does not prevent RNA polymerase binding and that both proteins can bind simultaneously to the promoter. Interestingly, CcpN and RNA polymerase, although able to bind simultaneously, appear to compete for binding to the used DNA fragments. Fig. 1 clearly shows that the bands for all three complexes are significantly weaker when both proteins are present than the complexes where only one of the proteins is present. Because CcpN and RNA polymerase concentrations have been chosen to reflect their actual concentrations in vivo 24Wagner R. Transcriptional Regulation in Prokaryotes. Oxford University Press, New York2000Google Scholar), 3A. Licht, unpublished observation. it is conceivable that there is also a competition between these two proteins for promoter binding within the cell. This finding would also explain the observations made by Servant et al. (3Servant P. Le Coq D. Aymerich S. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 1435-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) who reported a significant derepression of the pckA and gapB promoters in a ccpN knock-out mutant, even under gluconeogenic conditions where CcpN is not active, a feature that was also reported for other transcriptional repressors, although not to such a huge extent (25Barragán M.J. Blázquez B. Zamarro M.T. Mancheño J.M. García J.L. Díaz E. Carmona M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 10683-10694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Repressors that bind simultaneously with RNA polymerase, either at overlapping or at different sites, often repress transcription by preventing melting of DNA at the transcriptional start site, i.e. formation of the open complex. Such transcription factors are for example E. coli MerR at the merT promoter (26Heltzel A. Lee I.W. Totis P.A. Summers A.O. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9572-9584Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 27Summers A.O. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 3097-3101Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), which binds together with RNAP at opposite sites of the DNA helix, or the KorB protein of broad host range plasmid RK2 (28Williams D.R. Motallebi-Veshareh M. Thomas C.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 1141-1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), whose binding sites do not overlap those of RNAP. CcpN features both versions of operator sites; some overlap with RNAP binding sites whereas some do not (5Licht A. Brantl S. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 364: 434-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). However, open complex formation assays clearly ruled out the possibility that CcpN acts by preventing DNA melting at the sr1 and pckA and probably at the gapB promoter. The inhibition of the synthesis of abortive transcripts, as observed by us at the gapB promoter, is a case rarely reported in literature. The H-NS protein at the rrnB P1 promoter or the FIS protein at the gyrB promoter are two examples for this kind of repression (29Schröder O. Wagner R. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 298: 737-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 30Schneider R. Travers A. Kutateladze T. Muskhelishvili G. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 34: 953-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). For H-NS, a binding pattern similar to CcpN has been reported, where the operator overlaps the RNAP binding site. H-NS is then able to alter the DNA structure at this position, allowing the formation of open complexes, but preventing subsequent transcription. A similar mode of action is conceivable for CcpN at the gapB promoter, although an inhibition of open complex formation by CcpN under conditions where open complexes are formed efficiently cannot be ruled out. DNase I footprints have revealed the appearance of several hypersensitive sites upon CcpN binding at this promoter, which is usually a good indication for structural alterations of the DNA (3Servant P. Le Coq D. Aymerich S. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 55: 1435-1451Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 4Licht A. Preis S. Brantl S. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 58: 189-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). At the sr1 and pckA promoter, however, abortive transcripts are readily formed, but escape of RNA polymerase from the promoter is inhibited. Prevention of promoter clearance is usually mediated by one of two different ways: A repressor can bind downstream of RNAP and simply create a roadblock before a stable elongation complex can be formed. This has for example been shown for CcpA-mediated regulation of the treP gene in B. subtilis, and even as a proof of principle with an artificial construct using the Lac repressor (31Ujiie H. Matsutani T. Tomatsu H. Fujihara A. Ushida C. Miwa Y. Fujita Y. Himeno H. Muto A. J. Biochem. 2009; 145: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 32Lopez P.J. Guillerez J. Sousa R. Dreyfus M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 861-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Regarding the operator positions at the sr1 and pckA promoters, this mechanism appears to be highly unlikely, which favors the second alternative possibility: An interaction between the repressor molecule and parts of the RNA polymerase. It is known that the polymerase can be stalled at promoters with close-to-consensus sequences, resulting from a extremely tight binding that subsequently makes promoter clearance very difficult (33Ellinger T. Behnke D. Knaus R. Bujard H. Gralla J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 466-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Transcriptional repressors, which usually bind their operator sequences with high affinity, can mimic the aforementioned effect by binding RNAP and keeping it in place. Examples for this mechanism include the phage Φ29 protein p4 at the phage A2c promoter (34Monsalve M. Mencia M. Rojo F. Salas M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and the Gal repressor (35Choy H.E. Park S.W. Aki T. Parrack P. Fujita N. Ishihama A. Adhya S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4523-4529Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). With respect to our finding that CcpN is able to specifically interact with the RNA polymerase α-subunit, we conclude that CcpN acts as a repressor at the sr1 and pckA promoters by keeping RNAP in place through the aforementioned interaction. There are various reports about the α-subunit, and especially the C-terminal domain, being an interaction interface for transcriptional repressors, as mentioned above. However, interactions with the α-subunit have also been reported for activators, like CcpA at the ackA promoter (17Kim J.H. Yang Y.K. Chambliss G.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 36Turinsky A.J. Grundy F.J. Kim J.H. Chambliss G.H. Henkin T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5961-5967Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or SoxS during oxidative stress conditions (38Shah I.M. Wolf Jr., R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 343: 513-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Considering the binding site position of CcpN at the sr1 and pckA promoters, an interaction with the α-subunit appears very conceivable. It has been shown that up elements in B. subtilis have a slightly broader tolerance regarding location than in E. coli (39Gourse R.L. Ross W. Gaal T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 687-695Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 40Meijer W.J. Salas M.

At the gapB promoter, however, an interaction with the α-subunit can be excluded, because both operator sites are to far downstream to allow any contact between the two proteins. Two possibilities are conceivable for how CcpN exerts its action here: Either CcpN alters the DNA structure as mentioned above, or it interacts with an RNAP subunit other than the α-subunit or the σ-factor, because the first one cannot be contacted and no interaction has been detected with the latter. This ultimately leads to the inability to produce transcripts, probably by inhibiting transcription initiation, although an inhibition of open complex formation under different conditions is also conceivable. Reports of transcription factors that interact with e.g. the β-subunit are quite uncommon. One of these examples is the AsiA protein from bacteriophage T4 (41Severinova E. Severinov K. Darst S.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 9-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), another being the Rsd protein of E. coli (16Ilag L.L. Westblade L.F. Deshayes C. Kolb A. Busby S.J. Robinson C.V. Structure. 2004; 12: 269-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), both of which have been shown to be able to interact with the core RNA polymerase. If CcpN actually interacts with parts of the RNAP other than the α-subunit, this needs to be experimentally determined. However, the relatively small size of CcpN, leaving little space for extensive interaction surfaces and the fact that DNA structure is altered upon CcpN binding, seem to favor the possibility of repression by DNA structure rearrangements. The example of CcpN shows that one single repressor can exert repression in very different ways, depending on how its operators are positioned relative to the RNA polymerase binding sites. Varying binding site distribution is quite common, for example as found in the case of CytR from E. coli (37Collado-Vides J. Magasanik B. Gralla J.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 371-394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and many more. Interestingly, cases where variations in operator positioning result in different repression mechanisms have not been frequently reported in literature. However, this is mostly because the actual repression mechanism for these proteins has not been elucidated. A well documented example where operator site positions have an impact on the repression mechanism is cre element positioning, allowing CcpA to exert a broad range of repression or even activation mechanisms on its targets (17Kim J.H. Yang Y.K. Chambliss G.H. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 56: 155-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Taking all results together, a quite clear picture of the repression mechanism of CcpN can be established where CcpN and the α-subunits are in a spatial position that allows interaction and subsequent promoter arrest at the sr1 and pckA promoters, but not at the gapB promoter. Here, repression by modification of the DNA structure appears to be a probable alternative. We thank M. Salas for the gift of native purified B. subtilis RNA polymerase as well as for the strain for the overproduction of His-tagged α-subunit. Furthermore, we would like to thank M. Fujita who kindly sent us the strain for overproduction of His-tagged σ-factor. Download .pdf (.02 MB) Help with pdf files"
https://openalex.org/W2029171681,"We have screened an odorant compound library and discovered molecules acting as chemical signals that specifically activate both G-protein-coupled olfactory receptors (ORs) on the cell surface of olfactory sensory neurons and the human nuclear estrogen receptor alpha (ER) involved in transcriptional regulation of cellular differentiation and proliferation in a wide variety of tissues. Hence, these apparent dual active odorants induce distinct signal transduction pathways at different subcellular localizations, which affect both neuronal signaling, resulting in odor perception, and the ER-dependent transcriptional control of specific genes. We demonstrate these effects using fluorescence-based in vitro and cellular assays. Among these odorants, we have identified synthetic sandalwood compounds, an important class of molecules used in the fragrance industry. For one estrogenic odorant we have also identified the cognate OR. This prompted us to compare basic molecular recognition principles of odorants on the two structurally and apparent functionally non-related receptors using computational modeling in combination with functional assays. Faced with the increasing evidence that ORs may perform chemosensory functions in a number of tissues outside of the nasal olfactory epithelium, the unraveling of these molecular ligand-receptor interaction principles is of critical importance. In addition the evidence that certain olfactory sensory neurons naturally co-express ORs and ERs may provide a direct functional link between the olfactory and hormonal systems in humans. Our results are therefore useful for defining the structural and functional characteristics of ER-specific odorants and the role of odorant molecules in cellular processes other than olfaction."
https://openalex.org/W2039156979,"Sulfated polysaccharides such as heparin and heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (HSGAGs) are chemically and structurally heterogeneous biopolymers that that function as key regulators of numerous biological functions. The elucidation of HSGAG fine structure is fundamental to understanding their functional diversity, and this is facilitated by the use of select degrading enzymes of defined substrate specificity. Our previous studies have reported the cloning, characterization, recombinant expression, and structure-function analysis in Escherichia coli of the Flavobacterium heparinum 2-O-sulfatase and 6-O-sulfatase enzymes that cleave O-sulfate groups from specific locations of the HSGAG polymer. Building on these preceding studies, we report here the molecular cloning and recombinant expression in Escherichia coli of an N-sulfamidase, specific for HSGAGs. In addition, we examine the basic enzymology of this enzyme through molecular modeling studies and structure-function analysis of substrate specificity and basic biochemistry. We use the results from these studies to propose a novel mechanism for nitrogen-sulfur bond cleavage by the N-sulfamidase. Taken together, our structural and biochemical studies indicate that N-sulfamidase is a predominantly exolytic enzyme that specifically acts on N-sulfated and 6-O-desulfated glucosamines present as monosaccharides or at the nonreducing end of odd-numbered oligosaccharide substrates. In conjunction with the previously reported specificities for the F. heparinum 2-O-sulfatase, 6-O-sulfatase, and unsaturated glucuronyl hydrolase, we are able to now reconstruct in vitro the defined exolytic sequence for the heparin and heparan sulfate degradation pathway of F. heparinum and apply these enzymes in tandem toward the exo-sequencing of heparin-derived oligosaccharides.

HSGAGs are linear polymers with variable repeating disaccharide units and diverse chemical heterogeneity due to the variable positions of O- and N-linked sulfates (2.Esko J.D. Selleck S.B. Annu. Rev.

Other factors contributing to the structural diversity of HSGAGs include the presence of N-linked acetates and possible epimerization at the C-5 carboxylates. The structure-function relationship of this diversity plays out in the dynamic regulation by HSGAGs of various signaling pathways (4.Esko J.D. Lindahl U. J. Clin.

GAG degradation follows an obligatory sequence of depolymerization steps involving multiple enzymes acting in tandem to cleave the HSGAG chain.

Previously cited work in our laboratory has led to the molecular cloning and biochemical characterization of several HSGAG-degrading enzymes derived from the Gram-negative soil bacterium Flavobacterium heparinum (Pedobacter heparinus).

By their very nature, these latter enzymes provide an attractive subject of study and application given the following: 1) their respective substrate specificities, 2) their relevance as tools to probe multiple biological processes, and 3) a solid biochemical foundation of their structure-function relationships that include several protein structures (21.Bond C.S.

Taken together, these factors make the enzymes a useful “tool kit” for the structural characterization of heparin and heparan sulfate. Toward this end, we describe in the preceding paper (19.Myette J.R. Soundararajan V. Shriver Z. Raman R. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35177-35188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) the cloning, recombinant expression, structural and biochemical characterization of enzymatic action, and substrate specificity of the F. heparinum 6-O-sulfatase enzyme. In this paper, we extend this work through the cloning of the N-sulfamidase gene from F. heparinum and the bacterial expression of the gene product. A biochemical and structural characterization of the enzyme is also described, including a determination of the substrate specificity and metal ion requirements for optimal enzyme activity. This sulfamidase enzyme is unique because it hydrolyzes the sulfamate linkage (N–S) and not a sulfoester as is described for the other HSGAG sulfohydrolases. Using a homology-based structural model of the N-sulfamidase enzyme, we have outlined a possible mechanism for the N–S bond cleavage and the critical amino acids involved in both the catalytic activity and substrate specificity of the enzyme. Finally, taken together with the reported substrate specificities for the previously characterized F. heparinum 2-O-sulfatase, the 6-O-sulfatase (described in the preceding paper, see Ref. 19.Myette J.R. Soundararajan V. Shriver Z. Raman R. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol.

Glucosamine and galactosamine monosaccharides and aryl sulfate substrates 4-catechol sulfate and 4-methyllumbelliferyl sulfate were purchased from Sigma. Exo-glucosidases were purchased from MP Biomedicals (Irvine, CA). N-Sulfated fluorogenic glycopyranoside derivatives were obtained through Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Fluorescent glucopyranoside substrates 4-methyllumbelliferyl-α/β-d-glucopyranoside (4-MU-α-d-Glc and 4-MU-β-d-Glc) were purchased from EMD Biosciences, Inc. (San Diego). PCR enzymes, TOP10 chemically competent cells, and oligonucleotide primers were obtained from Invitrogen. Materials for genomic library construction and screening and site-directed mutagenesis were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Additional reagents for molecular cloning were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) or the listed manufacturers. PCR from a λZAPII flavobacterial genomic library originally screened using DNA hybridization probes specific to the 2-O-sulfatase (18.Myette J.R. Shriver Z. Claycamp C. McLean M.W. Venkataraman G.

Library construction, hybridization screening, and phage excision were performed as outlined. Two overlapping clones were expanded by chromosomal walking and Southern restriction mapping using the Lambda DASH II genomic cloning kit (Stratagene). This was used for the ligation of size-fractionated genomic DNA generated by partial digestion of Sau3AI. The DNA was purified from a high titer lysate using standard techniques, and three successive rounds of plaque purification were performed on 2-O-sulfatase-positive clones from an amplified library. Recombinant phage DNA was subcloned into pBluescript SK± for sequencing the DNA. The putative N-sulfamidase gene is described throughout this paper as orfc. The coding sequence of orfc was identified by the canonical Protein Families Database (24.Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Howe K.L. Sonnhammer E.L.

Subcloning of the amplified gene into T7-based bacterial expression vector pET28a (Novagen) was performed as an NdeI-XhoI cassettes described for the 6-O-sulfatase (19.Myette J.R. Soundararajan V.

Engelbrecht J. Brunak S. von Heijne G. Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4927) Google Scholar). The engineering and expression of the truncated protein lacking the signal sequence were as described for the complete gene with the exceptions of substituting the internal 5′ primer with 5′-TCT AGA CAT ATG TCC TGC ACT TCG CCG GAA-3′ (NdeI site underlined) and beginning the orfc gene sequence at Ser-21. Site-specific protease cleavage using the thrombin cleavage capture kit (Novagen) was performed to remove the His6 tag with proteolysis conditions as described for other recombinantly expressed flavobacterial heparin-degrading enzymes. Ultrafiltration was used to concentrate the enzymes, and cleaved proteins were dialyzed against 4 liters of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, and 0.1 m NaCl, 4 °C overnight using a 3-ml Slide-a-Lyzer cassette with a 10,000 molecular weight cutoff (Pierce). The Bradford assay (Bio-Rad) was used to determine final protein concentrations and was confirmed by UV absorption spectroscopy with theoretical molar extinction coefficients (ϵ280) of 86,340 (53,193 Da) for the NH2-terminally truncated orfc (N-sulfamidase). This value was calculated for the thrombin-cleaved protein lacking the His6 purification tag. To retain full enzyme activity for months, the enzyme was stored at 4 °C and 10 mg/ml concentration. Based on the homology modeling of the N-sulfamidase (described below), three residues were initially chosen for mutagenesis: Cys-80, Asp-40, and Lys-158. Site-directed mutagenesis was completed by thermal cycling using the QuickChangeTM method (Stratagene, La Jolla California) as described in the accompanying paper (19.Myette J.R. Soundararajan V.

Base pair changes are noted in lowercase boldface type. The same pET28 (His6) vector used for bacterial expression of the wild type N-sulfamidase-sulfatase was likewise used as the template for linear amplification. Parental DNA was restricted using DpnI. Targeted mutations were confirmed by direct DNA sequencing of both strands. The 4-catechol sulfate and 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate were two chromogenic substrates used to independently measure arylsulfatase activity. The catechol substrate assay was conducted as described (26.Beil S. Kehrli H. James P. Staudenmann W. Cook A.M. Leisinger T. Kertesz M.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 229: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Fluorimetric arylsulfatase assay using 4-methylumbelliferyl sulfate was also generally as described previously (27.Morimoto-Tomita M. Uchimura K. Werb Z. Hemmerich S. Rosen S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49175-49185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar), and detection of fluorescent methylumbelliferone was measured using a SpectraMax microtiter plate reader (GE Healthcare) set at excitation and emission wavelengths of 360 and 440 nm, respectively. Fluorescence intensity was corrected against background (minus enzyme control). In both assays, 0.5 unit of arylsulfatase from Aerobacter aerogenes was the positive control. For the pilot N-sulfamidase assay, initial assessment of substrate specificity and pH optima was made using a capillary electrophoresis-based assay for detection of desulfated products. The fluorescently derivatized monosulfated gluco- and galactopyranosides used as substrates to test enzyme activity included 4-MU-GlcNAc,6S, 4-MU-GlcNS, 4-MU-GalNAc,6S, and 4-MU-Gal6S. Standard reactions included 1 mm substrate, 1–10 μm enzyme, 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5–6.5, and 5 mm CaCl2 in a 20-μl reaction volume. Exhaustive reactions involving overnight incubations at 30 °C were used for pilot experiments. N-Sulfamidase was inactivated by heat denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by a 10-fold dilution into water, and the products were resolved by capillary electrophoresis using a 25-cm long, 75-μm inner diameter fused silica capillary (Agilent Technologies). Substrate desulfation was measured as a percentage of substrate depletion relative to a minus enzyme control as monitored by the loss of UV absorbance at 315 nm detected at ∼4 min. A standard capillary electrophoresis buffer included 50 mm Tris and 10 μm dextran sulfate (average molecular mass of 10,000 Da) adjusted to pH 2.0 with phosphoric acid. The effect of pH was measured by capillary electrophoresis using the following three sets of buffers with overlapping pH ranging from 4.5 to 8.0: 50 mm sodium citrate at 4.5, 5.0, and 5.5; 50 mm MES at 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, and 7.0; and 50 mm MOPS at 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0. For N-sulfamidase, the reactions included 4-MU-GlcNS, 50 mm buffer, and 5 mm CaCl2 in a 20-μl reaction volume, and this assay was initiated by addition of 2 μl of 10× enzyme stock to 18 μl of preheated reaction mixture. All the reactions were performed at 30 °C for 30 min each. The ability of N-sulfamidase to desulfate unsaturated heparin and chondroitin disaccharides was assessed essentially as described for CE-based compositional analyses of enzymatically generated glycosaminoglycan di- and tetrasaccharides (28.Venkataraman G. Shriver Z. Raman R. Sasisekharan R. Science. 1999; 286: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). A fluorimetrically based plate assay was used for indirect measurement of enzyme activity, in which the N-sulfamidase-driven desulfation of the glucopyranoside 1→4 methylbelliferone substrate was coupled to the glucosidase-controlled hydrolysis of the stereospecific 1→4 glycosidic linkage between the pyranose ring and the adjoining fluorophore. Release of the 4-MU was monitored spectroscopically as described above for the arylsulfatase assay. N-Sulfamidase hydrolysis of 4-MU-α-d-GlcNS at the 2-amino position was coupled to α-glucosidase (catalogue number 153487, MP Biomedicals), and the efficacy of this coupled assay was contingent on the intrinsically poor ability of the enzyme for hydrolyzing the glycosidic bond when the adjoining glucosamine is modified by a sulfate. The coupled N-sulfamidase assay was generally described for the 6-O-sulfatase (19.Myette J.R. Soundararajan V. Shriver Z. Raman R. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35177-35188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) but with the following modifications: 4-MU-GlcNS as substrate, 50 mm sodium acetate at pH 6.0 (instead of 5.5), and 1 μm enzyme. For the second enzyme step, 5 units of α-glucosidase were added. Enzyme incubation was carried out for 22 h at 37 °C. The obvious difference in enzyme efficacies between α-glucosidase versus β-glucosidase is reflected in the substantially longer incubation times required for the α-glucosidase to quantitatively hydrolyze the glycosidic α1→4 linkage between the fluorophore and the desulfated glucosamine. All other reaction conditions were as described for the coupled 6-O-sulfatase/β-glucosidase assay (19.Myette J.R. Soundararajan V. Shriver Z. Raman R. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35177-35188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Michaelis-Menten kinetics were extrapolated from Vo versus substrate concentration plots fit by nonlinear regression to pseudo first-order kinetics, and all obtained data represent mean of three experimental trials. The coupled enzyme assay was also used for the assessment of enzyme activity for select site-directed mutants. Enzyme activity was measured kinetically using a single saturating concentration (2 mm) of fluorescently labeled substrate. Results are reported as % activity relative to the wild type enzyme. 10 μm N-sulfamidase was preincubated with 20 μg of heparin for 8 h at 30 °C in a 20-μl reaction, which included 25 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0, and 2 mm calcium acetate, pH 7.0. The enzyme was then inactivated by heat denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, and the heparin was completely digested at 37 °C by the addition of 2 μl of concentrated enzyme mixture containing heparinase I and III. The CE-based compositional analyses of heparinase-derived disaccharides were performed as described (29.Myette J.R. Shriver Z. Kiziltepe T. McLean M.W. Venkataraman G. Sasisekharan R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 7424-7434Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The purified penta- and hexasulfated tetrasaccharides ΔU2SHNS,6SI±2SHNS,6S were a gift from Dr. I. Capila (Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). The following enzyme sequence was performed: 2-O-sulfatase, Δ4,5-glycuronidase, 6-O-sulfatase, and N-sulfamidase. The enzyme was heat-inactivated after each step, and 20-μl aliquots were removed prior to the addition of the next enzyme. The initial reaction conditions included 20 mm Tris, pH 7.2, and 60 nmol of tetrasaccharide in a 120-μl reaction volume, and enzyme reactions were carried out at 30 °C. The following specific conditions were also used: 1) 2-O-sulfatase, 1 μm enzyme, 6 h; 2) Δ4,5-glycuronidase, 1 μm enzyme, 6 h; 3) 6-O-sulfatase, 5 μm enzyme, 5 mm CaCl2, 12–15 h; 4) N-sulfamidase, same conditions as for 6-O-sulfatase. MALDI-mass spectrometry is an established method that was used for determination of the molecular masses of enzyme products (30.Rhomberg A.J. Ernst S. Sasisekharan R. Biemann K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 4176-4181Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The APTS derivatization protocol was adapted from Chen and Evangelista (31.Chen F.T. Evangelista R.A. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 230: 273-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2 μl of 100 mm APTS in 25% acetic acid (v/v) was mixed with 10 μl of 1 m sodium cyanoborohydride in tetrahydrofuran and 1 μmol of saccharide. The reaction mixture was incubated at 75 °C for 2 h and was diluted 1:100 prior to CE analysis. Capillary electrophoresis/laser-induced fluorescence was performed on a Beckman Coulter ProteomeLab PA 800 with a 488-nm argon laser-induced fluorescence module. Samples were loaded onto a N-CHO capillary (50-μm inner diameter × 65-cm total length) using 0.5 p.s.i. of pressure at the anode for 20 s. Electrophoretic separations were performed using a 20-kV potential in a 100 mm sodium borate, pH 10.2 buffer for 15 min at 25 °C. Fluorescence emission spectra were collected using a 520-nm narrow band filter. Electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry was performed generally as described for the 6-O-sulfatase (19.Myette J.R. Soundararajan V. Shriver Z. Raman R. Sasisekharan R. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 35177-35188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) but with a few modifications. Reactions were carried out with 100 μm substrate, 2 mm CaCl2, 5 μm enzyme, and 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0, at 37 °C overnight. Multiple sequence alignment of N-sulfamidase with human arylsulfatase A (Protein Data Bank code 1AUK), human arylsulfatase B (Protein Data Bank code 1FSU), and P. aeruginosa arylsulfatase B (Protein Data Bank code 1HDH) was performed using ClustalW (Fig. 1). The crystal structures of these enzymes were obtained from the Protein Data Bank and structure-based multiple superposition was obtained using CE-MC (32.Guda C. Lu S. Scheeff E.D. Bourne P.E. Shindyalov I.N. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W100-W103Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and SuperPose (33.Maiti R. Van Domselaar G.H. Zhang H. Wishart D.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W590-W594Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). The Homology module of Insight II molecular simulations package (Accelrys, San Diego) was used to obtain a structural model of N-sulfamidase with PDB 1AUK as template. The loop regions of the structure were modeled using the homology module of InsightII. The deletions were closed using the Discover module of Insight II, wherein most of the structure was held rigid except for the regions in the proximity of the deletion site, followed by 200 iterations of steepest descent and 300 iterations of conjugate gradient minimization. The loop regions and side chains of all residues were then allowed to move freely by performing 300 iterations of steepest descent minimization. This was followed by further refinement of the structure by subjecting it to 500 iterations of steepest descent minimization without including charges and 500 iterations of conjugate gradient minimization, including charges to obtain the final predicted model of N-sulfamidase. The coordinates of a heparin-derived hexasaccharide were obtained from co-crystal structure of FGF-1 heparin complex (Protein Data Bank code 2AXM). The hexasaccharide coordinates were imported into the Builder module of InsightII to generate the monosaccharide (GlcNS, GlcNS,3S, and GlcNS,6S) and disaccharide (ΔU±2SHNS±6S) substrates for N-sulfamidase. As with our previous studies on other sulfatases, the initial docking of the substrates in the enzyme groove was facilitated by the highly conserved position of the cleavable NHSO3− group relative to the O-γ1 of the geminal diol. The enzyme-substrate complexes were then subjected to optimization with 300 steps of steepest descent followed by 400 steps of Newton-Raphson minimization, including charges, using the Discover module of Insight II. In this step, a force constant of 7000 kcal/mol was utilized to constrain the ring torsion angles to maintain the ring conformation of the substrates. The Amber force field was used to assign potentials to enzy"
https://openalex.org/W1970722777,"GATA-1 is a lineage-restricted transcription factor that plays essential roles in hematopoietic development. The Gata1 gene hematopoietic enhancer allowed Gata1 reporter expression in erythroid cells and megakaryocytes of transgenic mice. The Gata1 hematopoietic enhancer activity is strictly dependent on a GATA site located in the 5' region of the enhancer. However, the importance of the GC-rich region adjacent to the 3'-end of this GATA site has been also suggested. In this study, we show that this GC-rich region contains five contiguous deoxyguanosine residues (G(5) string) that are bound by multiple nuclear proteins. Interestingly, deletion of one deoxyguanosine residue from the G(5) string (G(4) mutant) specifically eliminates binding to ZBP-89, a Krüppel-like transcription factor, but not to Sp3 and other binding factors. We demonstrate that GATA-1 and ZBP-89 occupy chromatin regions of the Gata1 enhancer and physically associate in vitro through zinc finger domains. Gel mobility shift assays and DNA affinity precipitation assays suggest that binding of ZBP-89 to this region is reduced in the absence of GATA-1 binding to the G1HE. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrate that ZBP-89 activates the Gata1 enhancer depending on the G(5) string sequence. Finally, transgenic mouse studies reveal that the G(4) mutation significantly reduced the reporter activity of the Gata1 hematopoietic regulatory domain encompassing an 8.5-kbp region of the Gata1 gene. These data provide compelling evidence that the G(5) string is necessary for Gata1 gene expression in vivo and ZBP-89 is the functional trans-acting factor for this cis-acting region."

Unlike gp120, E-gp120 formed covalent oligomers. The reactivity of gp120 and E-gp120 with mAbs to reference neutralizing epitopes was markedly different, indicating their divergent structures. Epitope mapping with synthetic peptides and electrophilic peptide analogs indicated binary recognition of two distinct gp120 regions by anti-E-gp120 mAbs, the 421–433 and 288–306 peptide regions. Univalent Fab and single chain Fv fragments expressed the ability to recognize both peptides. X-ray crystallography of an anti-E-gp120 Fab fragment revealed two neighboring cavities, the typical antigen-binding cavity formed by the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) and another cavity dominated by antibody heavy chain variable (VH) domain framework (FR) residues. Substitution of the FR cavity VH Lys-19 residue by an Ala residue resulted in attenuated binding of the 421–433 region peptide probe. The CDRs and VH FR replacement/silent mutation ratios exceeded the ratio for a random mutation process, suggesting adaptive development of both putative binding sites. All mAbs studied were derived from VH1 family genes, suggesting biased recruitment of the V gene germ line repertoire by E-gp120. The conserved 421–433 region of gp120 is essential for HIV binding to host CD4 receptors.

The antigen-binding site is mostly formed by the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of the light and heavy chain variable domains (VL and VH domains). Vaccine-induced adaptive Ab responses entail sequence diversification of Ab V domains expressed within the B cell receptor (BCR) complex, selective noncovalent antigen binding to the high affinity BCR mutants, and proliferation of the mutant B cell clones. No HIV vaccine is available. The surface of HIV is studded with noncovalently associated oligomers of gp120 complexed to gp41. HIV infection and experimental HIV vaccination attempts induce robust Ab responses to the immunodominant epitopes of gp120, which are structurally divergent in various HIV strains responsible for infection in different parts of the world. Abs to such epitopes express strain-specific neutralization (1Moore J.P. Parren P.W. Burton D.R. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 5721-5729Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 2Karlsson Hedestam G.B.

The 421–433 region is a member of a small group of microbial polypeptide sites recognized selectively by Abs produced by the immune system without prior infection by the microbe (preimmune Abs) (7Berberian L.

The CD4BS, however, is poorly immunogenic. Traditional immunization methods do not stimulate the adaptive synthesis of neutralizing Abs to the 421–433 region or other CD4BS epitopes. Neutralizing Abs that bind the CD4BS are found in the blood of a subset of patients after years of HIV infection, but the target epitope is not identified, and Ab response is weak (23Chuenchitra T.

A CD4BS mimetic of the epitope recognized by a well known anti-CD4BS neutralizing mAb (clone b12) did not induce the synthesis of neutralizing Abs (32Saphire E.O. Montero M.

Importantly, small synthetic peptides are often more flexible than the corresponding native protein segments. Inducing a traditional adaptive immune response in which the Ab CDRs develop binding specificity for the peptide immunogen therefore does not ensure recognition of the native 421–433 CD4BS region (35Morrow W.J.

From mutagenesis and sequence identity studies, the gp120-binding site of preimmune Abs, in contrast, is composed mainly of the VH domain FR1 and FR3 (10Karray S. Juompan L. Maroun R.C. Isenberg D.

As certain preimmune Abs express HIV neutralizing activity attributable to recognition of the 421–433 region (13Planque S. Mitsuda Y. Taguchi H. Salas M. Morris M.K. Nishiyama Y. Kyle R. Okhuysen P.

There is, however, substantial difficulty in amplifying and improving the subset of preimmune Abs with HIV neutralizing activity for vaccination against the virus; SAg binding to Ab FRs fails to stimulate adaptive B cell differentiation and synthesis of specific IgG class Abs (38Berberian L.

https://openalex.org/W2125872299,"In our previous study, we have found that thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is synthesized de novo upon monocyte and neutrophil apoptosis, leading to a phagocytic and tolerizing phenotype of dendritic cells (DC), even prior to DC-apoptotic cell interaction. Interestingly, we were able to show that heparin binding domain (HBD), the N-terminal portion of TSP-1, was cleaved and secreted simultaneously in a caspase- and serine protease- dependent manner. In the current study we were interested to examine the role of HBD in the clearance of apoptotic cells, and whether the phagocytic and tolerizing state of DCs is mediated by the HBD itself, or whether the entire TSP-1 is needed. Therefore, we have cloned the human HBD, and compared its interactions with DC to those with TSP-1. Here we show that rHBD by itself is not directly responsible for immune paralysis and tolerizing phenotype of DCs, at least in the monomeric form, but has a significant role in rendering DCs phagocytic. Binding of TSP-1-C-terminal domain on the other hand induces a tolerizing phenotype in dendritic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2050992446,"Background Medical news that appears on newspaper front pages is intended to reach a wide audience, but how this type of medical news is prepared and distributed has not been systematically researched. We thus quantified the level of visibility achieved by front-page medical stories in the United States and analyzed their news sources. Methodology Using the online resource Newseum, we investigated front-page newspaper coverage of four prominent medical stories, and a high-profile non-medical news story as a control, reported in the US in 2007. Two characteristics were quantified by two raters: which newspaper titles carried each target front-page story (interrater agreement, >96%; kappa, >0.92) and the news sources of each target story (interrater agreement, >94%; kappa, >0.91). National rankings of the top 200 US newspapers by audited circulation were used to quantify the extent of coverage as the proportion of the total circulation of ranked newspapers in Newseum. Findings In total, 1630 front pages were searched. Each medical story appeared on the front pages of 85 to 117 (67.5%–78.7%) ranked newspaper titles that had a cumulative daily circulation of 23.1 to 33.4 million, or 61.8% to 88.4% of all newspapers. In contrast, the non-medical story achieved front-page coverage in 152 (99.3%) newspaper titles with a total circulation of 41.0 million, or 99.8% of all newspapers. Front-page medical stories varied in their sources, but the Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, New York Times and the Associated Press together supplied 61.7% of the total coverage of target front-page medical stories. Conclusion Front-page coverage of medical news from different sources is more accurately revealed by analysis of circulation counts rather than of newspaper titles. Journals wishing to widen knowledge of research news and organizations with important health announcements should target at least the four dominant media organizations identified in this study."
https://openalex.org/W2045107694,"This work investigates the role of charge of the phosphorylated aspartate, Asp369, of Na+,K+-ATPase on E1 ↔ E2 conformational changes. Wild type (porcine α1/His10-β1), D369N/D369A/D369E, and T212A mutants were expressed in Pichia pastoris, labeled with fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate (FITC), and purified. Conformational changes of wild type and mutant proteins were analyzed using fluorescein fluorescence (Karlish, S. J. (1980) J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 12, 111–136). One central finding is that the D369N/D369A mutants are strongly stabilized in E2 compared with wild type and D369E or T212A mutants. Stabilization of E2(Rb) is detected by a reduced K0.5Rb for the Rb+-induced E1 ↔ E2(2Rb) transition. The mechanism involves a greatly reduced rate of E2(2Rb) → E1Na with no effect on E1 → E2(2Rb). Lowering the pH from 7.5 to 5.5 strongly stabilizes wild type in E2 but affects the D369N mutant only weakly. Thus, this “Bohr” effect of pH on E1 ↔ E2 is due largely to protonation of Asp369. Two novel effects of phosphate and vanadate were observed with the D369N/D369A mutants as follows. (a) E1 → E2·P is induced by phosphate without Mg2+ ions by contrast with wild type, which requires Mg2+. (b) Both phosphate and vanadate induce rapid E1 → E2 transitions compared with slow rates for the wild type. With reference to crystal structures of Ca2+-ATPase and Na+,K+-ATPase, negatively charged Asp369 favors disengagement of the A domain from N and P domains (E1), whereas the neutral D369N/D369A mutants favor association of the A domain (TGES sequence) with P and N domains (E2).

The molecular mechanism is, of course, the central question of energy transduction. Molecular structures of the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA1) in several conformations are available (1Olesen C. Picard M. Winther A.M. Gyrup C. Morth J.P. Oxvig C. Møller J.V. Nissen P.

The architecture of the α subunit is very similar to the Ca2+-ATPase, consisting of head, stalk, and membrane sectors, with 10 trans-membrane segments and a cytoplasmic sector consisting of N (nucleotide binding), P (phosphorylating), and A (anchor or actuator) domains. Compared with the first published structure of the Na+,K+-ATPase at 3.5 Å (5Morth J.P. Pedersen B.P. Toustrup-Jensen M.S. Sørensen T.L. Petersen J. Andersen J.P. Vilsen B. Nissen P.

In the case of Na+,K+-ATPase, three Na+ ions and two K+ ions are transported in the E1ATP → E1P(3Na) →E2P and the E2P → E2(2K) → E1ATP halves of the cycle, respectively, at the expense of one molecule of ATP. Binding of ATP with low affinity to E2(2K) is the first step in the catalytic cycle and is followed by accelerated conversion of E2(2K)ATP to E1·ATP in which ATP is bound with high affinity (7Post R.L.

In the case of Ca2+-ATPase, two Ca2+ ions and two protons are transported in the E1ATP → E1P → E2P E2P → E2 → E1ATP halves of the cycle, respectively. The mechanism of energy transduction by P-type cation pumps is best addressed by reference to the Ca2+-ATPase, which has been crystallized in most of the relevant conformations, reviewed recently in detail (1Olesen C. Picard M. Winther A.M. Gyrup C. Morth J.P. Oxvig C. Møller J.V. Nissen P. Nature. 2007; 450: 1036-1042Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 2Toyoshima C. Arch. Biochem.

Crystal structures of Ca2+-ATPase show mainly rigid body movements of the N, P, and A domains, mediated by the flexible linkers between the N and P and between the A domain and trans-membrane segment (M1–M3), coupled mechanically to movements of M1–M6 trans-membrane segments that allow alternate access of two Ca2+ ions and two protons to the occlusion sites within M4, M5, M6, and M8. M7–M10 segments appear to act as immovable anchors. In the E1ATP state, N and P domains are in close proximity cross-linked by the bound ATP, whereas the A domain is displaced to one side. Following phosphorylation to E1P, the conformational change to E2P involves a large rotation of the A domain bringing it into close proximity with the P domain, and also the N domain, whereas the N domain is displaced from the P domain. In particular, the conserved sequence TGES (A domain) comes close to the phosphorylated aspartate (P domain). Following hydrolysis of E2P and dissociation of phosphate, ATP bound to E2 induces the change back to the E1 state, with the A domain displaced, and the P and N domains come back into close proximity. This study was prompted by the following paradox. In the case of Ca2+-ATPase, dissociation of ADP from E1P triggers the E1P → E2P transition. This arises because the ADP (in the E1P structure) and the TGES loop (in the E2P structure) occupy the same position relative to the P domain (3Toyoshima C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2009; 1793: 941-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). In the case of Na+,K+-ATPase, ADP, like ATP, is known to stabilize the E1 conformation (9Jorgensen P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 401: 399-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 10Schuurmans Stekhoven F.M. Swarts H.G. Zhao R.S. de Pont J.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 861: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Thus, it is clear that ADP must dissociate from E1P(3Na) to allow the transition to E2P. However, in the absence of ADP or ATP, an E1 conformation is stable either with bound Na+ or without Na+ in a sufficiently high ionic strength buffer (9Jorgensen P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 401: 399-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 11Karlish S.J. Yates D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 527: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 12Skou J.C.

This is different from Ca2+-ATPase in which E2 is the principal conformation in the absence of Ca2+ ions at neutral pH (14Dupont Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 71: 544-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 15Dupont Y. Leigh J.B. Nature. 1978; 273: 396-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 16Pick U. Karlish S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6120-6126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In other words, for Na+,K+-ATPase a spontaneous conformational change of the dephosphoenzyme E1 → E2 or E1(3Na) → E2 does not occur even when ADP is absent, but it occurs only in the context of the phosphoenzyme E1P(3Na) → E2P. Thus, a question arises whether dissociation of ADP from E1P(3Na) is sufficient or whether the covalently bound phosphate/Mg2+ itself plays a role in triggering the E1P(3Na) → E2P conformational change. One way to address this issue is to investigate a possible role of the phosphorylated aspartate, Asp369. D369N/D369A/D369T/D369E mutants of Na+,K+-ATPase have been expressed previously in different cells and shown to abolish ATP hydrolysis (17Kuntzweiler T.A. Wallick E.T. Johnson C.L. Lingrel J.B. J.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16085-16093Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) expressed wild type and D369N and D369A mutants in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and found that, although they are inactive, the D369N/D369A mutants have a very high affinity for ATP, compared with wild type, but have a similar ADP binding affinity. By analyzing antagonism of ATP binding by K+ ions, it was also suggested that the E1 ↔ E2 equilibrium is altered, favoring E2 conformations. The D369N mutant was later expressed in Pichia pastoris (20Strugatsky D. Gottschalk K.E. Goldshleger R. Bibi E. Karlish S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46064-46073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and studied by specific oxidative cleavages mediated by Fe2+, which substitutes for the catalytic Mg2+ (21Karlish S.J. Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 2003; 986: 39-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The D369N mutation strongly suppressed specific Fe2+-catalyzed cleavages. Compared with the wild type Ca2+-ATPase, mutants of its corresponding phosphorylated aspartate, D351N/D351A/D351T, also bind ATP with a very high affinity (22McIntosh D.B. Woolley D.G. MacLennan D.H. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25227-25236Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). A recent crystal structure of D351A with bound ATP is virtually identical to the wild type, showing that the high affinity is due to removal of electrostatic repulsion between the γ-phosphate of ATP and the Asp351 carboxylate, and not to a conformational change (23Marchand A. Winther A.M. Holm P.J. Olesen C. Montigny C. Arnou B. Champeil P. Clausen J.D. Vilsen B. Andersen J.P. Nissen P. Jaxel C. Møller J.V. le Maire M. J. Biol.

They allow detailed characterization of specificities and affinities of ligands that stabilize E1 or E2 forms and especially measurement of rates of individual E1 → E2 and E2 → E1 transitions (8Karlish S.J.

The high yield of purified protein now makes it possible to carry out detailed biochemical and biophysical work. Development of fluorescein-labeled recombinant Na+,K+-ATPase described here has allowed us to examine directly effects of charge neutralization on Asp369 on E1 ↔ E2 equilibria and to investigate its mechanism. Escherichia coli XL-1 blue strain was used for propagation and preparation of various plasmid constructs. Yeast Lytic Enzyme from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. (catalogue number 152270), was used for transformation of yeast. P. pastoris protease-deficient strain SMD1165 (his4, prb1) was used for transformation. DDM (catalogue number D310) and C12E8 (25% w/w, catalogue number O330) were purchased from Anatrace. Synthetic SOPS (sodium salt)) was obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids and stored as chloroform solutions. BD TalonTM metal affinity resin (catalogue number 635503) was obtained from Clontech. Cholesterol, ouabain (O3125), and FITC (catalogue number F7250) were from Sigma. [32P]ATP and [3H]ouabain were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. All other materials were of analytical grade. YPD is 1% bacto-yeast extract, 2% bacto-peptone, 2% dextrose. To solidify the medium 2% Bacto-agar was added. YNB is yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco). BMG is 1.34% YNB, 0.04% biotin, 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, glycerol 0.2–1%. BMM is 1.34% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.04% biotin, 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, 0.5% methanol. The pHIL-D2(α1/His10-β1) construct contained cDNAs encoding wild type or mutant porcine α1 (GenBankTM accession number X03938) and porcine β1 (GenBankTM accession number X04635) with a 10× His tag at the N′ terminus of the β subunit is described in Ref. 37Cohen E.

D369N/D369A/D369E, T212A, and E214A/E214Q mutants were prepared by the methods described previously (39Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6850) Google Scholar). 10 μg of linear DNA, obtained by digestion of the pHIL-D2 (wild type or mutant α1/His10-β1) with NotI, were used to transform spheroplasts of P. pastoris SMD1165, and His+Muts transformants were selected (20Strugatsky D.

Muts clones were grown in 5 ml of BMG cultures, and expression was induced with methanol for 5 days. Small scale membrane preparations were made. Samples were run on SDS-PAGE, and relative expression in the different Muts clones was determined by Western blots, using the antibody anti-KETYY antibody (at a dilution of 1:3000), which recognizes the C terminus of the α subunit. Ouabain binding was also carried out to determine the highest expressing clones that were subsequently used routinely. For large scale growth and expression of the recombinant Na+,K+-ATPase (20Strugatsky D. Gottschalk K.E. Goldshleger R. Bibi E. Karlish S.J. J. Biol.

The culture was further diluted 100-fold to a final volume of 300 ml and grown in the BMG medium (glycerol 1%) for a further 24 h to an A600 of 2–6. Cells were then poured into 3 liters of BMG medium (with 0.2% glycerol) in Bellco Spinner FlasksTM with air supplement (0.5 liter/min) and magnetic stirring at 250 rpm, and temperature was maintained at 30 °C. After 24 h, cell growth had stopped (A600 = 2–4). Expression of the Na+,K+-ATPase was induced by adding 0.5% methanol daily for 5 days. Routinely, the wild type was induced at 25 °C and mutants at 20 °C. The maximal A600 achieved under these conditions was ∼10–15. On the 6th day cells were collected and stored at −20 °C. Cells were broken with glass beads, and membranes were prepared as described previously (20Strugatsky D. Gottschalk K.E. Goldshleger R. Bibi E. Karlish S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46064-46073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Membranes were stored at −80 °C in a solution containing 10 mm MOPS/Tris, pH 7.4, and 25% glycerol, with a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, chemostatin, and leupeptin). Roughly 1 g of membrane protein was obtained per 3 liters of culture. For FITC labeling (see Ref. 13Karlish S.J. J. Bioenerg.

Fluorescein 5′-isothiocyanate (usually 1–2 μm FITC dissolved in DMSO) was added, and membranes were incubated for 1 h at 20 °C in the dark. The suspension was then diluted 3-fold with an ice-cold solution of 100 mm MOPS, pH 6.45, mixed for 10 min, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 80 min. The pelleted labeled membranes were resuspended at 1 mg/ml in 10 mm MOPS/Tris, pH 7.4, and 25% glycerol. Fluorescein bound to α subunit, separated by SDS-PAGE, was detected with a Typhoon fluorescence imager with excitation supplied by a blue laser and emission at 520 nm set by a monochromator. The methods have been described in detail (37Cohen E. Goldshleger R. Shainskaya A. Tal D.M. Ebel C. le Maire M. Karlish S.J. J. Biol.

Briefly, unlabeled or FITC-labeled membranes (1–2 mg/ml) were homogenized well for 15 min on ice with DDM (DDM/protein, 2:1 w/w) in a medium containing 250 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm imidazole, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol. Unsolubilized material was removed by ultracentrifugation. The soluble material was incubated with shaking overnight at 4 °C with BD TalonTM beads (Co2+-chelate), at a ratio of 1 ml of beads per supernatant from 100 mg of membrane protein, together with 50–100 μm EDTA. Beads were washed twice with 5 volumes of buffer containing 125 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tricine, pH 7.4, 5% glycerol, 10 mm imidazole, 0.1 mg/ml C12E8, 0.05 mg/ml SOPS, 0.01 mg/ml cholesterol. The Na+,K+-ATPase (0.2–3 mg/ml) was eluted by mixing with 1 volume of a solution containing 150 mm imidazole, 20 mm Tricine, pH 7.4, 0.1 mg/ml C12E8, 0.05 mg/ml SOPS, 0.01 mg/ml cholesterol, 25% glycerol for 45 min at 0 °C and stored on ice. Protein was determined by scanning Coomassie-stained gels for the α subunit content of the purified recombinant enzyme and compared with known amounts of pig kidney Na+,K+-ATPase. Ouabain binding to yeast membranes was assayed using [3H]ouabain essentially as described (19Pedersen P.A. Rasmussen J.H. Jørgensen P.L. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16085-16093Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Na+,K+-ATPase activities and covalent phosphorylation were done as described (38Haviv H. Cohen E. Lifshitz Y. Tal D.M.

Equilibrium fluorescence changes were measured in a Varian fluorimeter at room temperature (20–23 °C). 10–15 μg of FITC-labeled purified recombinant enzyme were incubated for 30 min at room temperature and then added to a stirred cuvette containing 2 ml of the following solution: 150 mm choline chloride, 10 mm Hepes (Tris), pH 7.5 (and other pH values between 7 and 8), or 10 mm Mes (Tris) (pH range 5.5–6.5). The same buffer with no enzyme was used to bring the fluorescence level to zero before addition of the enzyme. Excitation was at 495 nm, and emission was at 520 nm, with both slits adjusted to 5 nm. After stabilization of the fluorescence, ligands such as RbCl, KCl or NaCl, Pi(Tris), and vanadate (Tris) were added until no further fluorescence change occurred. For equilibrium titrations, graded concentrations of ligands such as RbCl were added, and the fluorescence change was recorded. For each addition, a correction was made for the dilution effects of the added volume. Stopped-flow fluorescence measurements at 23 °C were made using an Applied Photophysics stopped-flow fluorimeter. Excitation via a monochromator was at 495 nm, and emission was measured via a 515-nm cutoff filter. The two syringes were loaded with 1.2 ml of solution. Each push utilized 70 μl per syringe. 3–4 pushes were used to fill the flow tubes, thus allowing up to 10 replicates for repetitive measurement in each condition. Dead time was ∼1.5 ms. Purified enzyme was incubated for 30 min at room temperature before mixing with the relevant solution. Traces were smoothed with the use of an “oversample” function of the machine. 4–9 such traces were then averaged to produce a single trace and analyzed as described below. Total ionic strength of all solutions in syringe 1 and 2 was maintained at 175 mm, consisting of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and choline chloride, RbCl, KCl, NaCl, or other ligands such Pi (Tris) or vanadate (Tris) at a total ionic strength of 165 mm. Solutions not containing monovalent cations or other ligands consisted of 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, and 165 mm choline chloride. The final concentrations of all ligands not present in both syringes was half that given below. The design of the experiments follows that developed previously (8Karlish S.J. Yates D.W. Glynn I.M.

Syringe 1 contained FITC-labeled wild type or 20–30 μg of D369N/D369A mutants and 20 mm RbCl or KCl (wild type) or 4 mm mutants. Syringe 2 contained 80 mm NaCl. Syringe 1 contained FITC-labeled wild type or 20–50 μg of D369N/D369A mutants. Syringe 2 contained 40, 60, and 165 mm RbCl (wild type and D369N/D369A mutants) or 20–165 mm KCl (wild type). Syringe 1 contained FITC-labeled wild type or 15–30 μg of D369N mutants and 4 mm MgCl2, and 15–30 μg of D369A without MgCl2. Syringe 2 contained 50 mm Pi (Tris), pH 7.5, or 2 mm vanadate (Tris) and 4 mm MgCl2. All fits were done using the KaleidaGraph program (Synergy Software). 1) Rb+ titrations in equilibrium measurements were fitted to the following form of the Hill Equation 1, ΔF=ΔFmax•[Rb]n/([Rb]n+K0.5n)(Eq. 1) where n = Hill coefficient, and K0.5 = concentration of Rb+ ions required for half-maximal fluorescent signal."
