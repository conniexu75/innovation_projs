Here, we have investigated the interaction of the PWWP domain with modified histone tails using peptide arrays and show that it specifically recognizes the histone 3 lysine 36 trimethylation mark. H3K36me3 is known to be a repressive modification correlated with DNA methylation in mammals and heterochromatin in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. These results were confirmed by equilibrium peptide binding studies and pulldown experiments with native histones and purified native nucleosomes. The PWWP-H3K36me3 interaction is important for the subnuclear localization of enhanced yellow fluorescent protein-fused Dnmt3a. Furthermore, the PWWP-H3K36me3 interaction increases the activity of Dnmt3a for methylation of nucleosomal DNA as observed using native nucleosomes isolated from human cells after demethylation of the DNA with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine as substrate for methylation with Dnmt3a. These data suggest that the interaction of the PWWP domain with H3K36me3 is involved in targeting of Dnmt3a to chromatin carrying that mark, a model that is in agreement with several studies on the genome-wide distribution of DNA methylation and H3K36me3.

In mammals, DNA methylation plays important roles in differentiation, gene regulation, genomic imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, and disease-related processes (1Goll M.G. Bestor T.H. Annu. Rev.

The ADD domains of Dnmt3L and Dnmt3a have been shown to interact with the histone 3 tail unmethylated at Lys4 (10Ooi S.K. Qiu C. Bernstein E. Li K. Jia D. Yang Z. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P.

However, the ADD domain is not directly involved in heterochromatic targeting of Dnmt3a (17Chen T. Tsujimoto N. Li E. Mol. Cell.

PWWP domains belong to the Royal domain superfamily, members of which were identified to interact with histone tails in various modification states (19Taverna S.D. Li H. Ruthenburg A.J. Allis C.D. Patel D.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1025-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). The PWWP domains of Dnmt3a and 3b are essential for heterochromatic targeting (17Chen T.

An S333P missense mutation in the Dnmt3a PWWP domain (numbering refers to murine Dnmt3a) led to the loss of chromatin targeting of Dnmt3a (18Ge Y.Z. Pu M.T. Gowher H. Wu H.P. Ding J.P. Jeltsch A.

This mutation corresponds to the S282P mutation in the PWWP domain of human Dnmt3b, which has been identified in immunodeficiency, centromeric heterochromatin instability, and facial anomalies syndrome patients (20Shirohzu H. Kubota T. Kumazawa A. Sado T. Chijiwa T. Inagaki K. Suetake I. Tajima S. Wakui K. Miki Y. Hayashi M. Fukushima Y. Sasaki H. Am. J. Med.

Here, we explore the possibility of the interaction of the Dnmt3a PWWP domain with histone peptides using modified histone tail peptide arrays. We discovered its specific interaction with H3K36me3 and show that this interaction is important for the subnuclear localization of Dnmt3a and for its catalytic activity on native chromatin. The sequence encoding the PWWP domain of murine Dnmt3a (residues 279–420) was subcloned as a GST fusion protein into the pGEX-6P2 vector (GE Healthcare) using BamHI/XhoI sites. The GST-tagged PWWP domain and its variants were expressed and purified as described (21Rathert P. Dhayalan A. Murakami M. Zhang X. Tamas R. Jurkowska R. Komatsu Y. Shinkai Y. Cheng X. Jeltsch A. Nat. Chem. Biol. 2008; 4: 344-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The full-length murine Dnmt3a2 cloned into pET28a (Novagen) vector was used for the expression and purification of full-length Dnmt3a2 (22Jurkowska R.Z. Anspach N. Urbanke C. Jia D. Reinhardt R. Nellen W. Cheng X. Jeltsch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 6656-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), which is the predominant isoform of Dnmt3a in embryonic stem cells (23Chen T. Ueda Y. Xie S. Li E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38746-38754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The catalytic domain of Dnmt3a (Dnmt3a-CD) was expressed and purified as described (24Gowher H. Jeltsch A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 20409-20414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). To prepare the EYFP-Dnmt3a expression construct used for subnuclear localization studies, Dnmt3a was cloned from a pET expression vector (25Gowher H. Jeltsch A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 309: 1201-1208Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) into pcDNA3.1, yielding pcDNA-Dnmt3a. Then EYFP was amplified from pEYFP-C1 (Clontech) and cloned into pcDNA-Dnmt3a in front of the Dnmt3a gene to encode for an EGFP-Dnmt3a fusion protein. The E290A and D329A mutations in the PWWP domain of Dnmt3a and the D329A mutation in Dnmt3a2 and in EGFP-Dnmt3a were introduced by using a PCR megaprimer mutagenesis method as described previously (26Jeltsch A. Lanio T. Methods Mol. Biol. 2002; 182: 85-94PubMed Google Scholar). Successful mutagenesis and cloning was confirmed by restriction marker site analysis and DNA sequencing. Peptide arrays were synthesized on cellulose membranes using the SPOT synthesis method (27Frank R. J. Immunol. Methods. 2002; 267: 13-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). Each spot had diameters of 2 mm and contained ∼9 nmol of peptide (Autospot Reference Handbook, Intavis AG). Successful synthesis of each peptide was confirmed by bromphenol blue staining of the membranes. H3 26–44 K36me3 (with N-terminal fluorescein label) and unmodified H3 26–44 peptides were purchased from Intavis AG in purified form. The cellulose membrane was blocked by incubation in TTBS buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.3, 0.05% Tween 20, and 150 mm NaCl) containing 5% nonfat dried milk at 4 °C overnight. The membrane was then washed once with TTBS buffer and incubated with purified GST-tagged PWWP domain of Dnmt3a or mutant domains (10 nm) at room temperature for 1 h in interaction buffer (100 mm KCl, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol). After washing in TTBS buffer, the membrane was incubated with goat anti-GST antibody (GE Healthcare, catalog number 27-4577-01 at 1:5000 dilution) in TTBS buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Then the membrane was washed three times with TTBS and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat antibody (Invitrogen catalog number 81-1620 1:12000) in TTBS for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, the membrane was submerged in ECL developing solution (GE Healthcare), and the image was captured in x-ray film. Fluorescence depolarization experiments were carried out at 25 °C using a Varian Carry Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer. For the determination of the binding constant of the PWWP domain to the fluorophore-coupled H3 K36me3 peptide, 0.1 μm of peptide was incubated with increasing concentrations of PWWP domain (0.8–60 μm) in interaction buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100), and fluorescence depolarization was determined (excitation at 494 nm, emission at 524 nm, and excitation and emission slits at 5 nm). The data were fitted to a binary binding equilibrium to determine the equilibrium binding constant. For competition experiments, 30 μm of fluorophore-coupled H3K36me3 was incubated with 30 μm of PWWP domain in interaction buffer, and their interaction was competed by 2- and 5-fold molar excesses of unlabeled unmodified H3 26–44 peptide. Native histones were isolated from HEK293 cells by acid extraction as described (28Shechter D. Dormann H.L. Allis C.D. Hake S.B. Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1445-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar). Native nucleosomes were prepared from HEK293 cells by partial micrococcal nuclease (New England Biolabs) digestion of nuclei as described (29Brand M. Rampalli S. Chaturvedi C.P. Dilworth F.J. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 398-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), except that after micrococcal nuclease digestion the nuclei were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant containing nucleosomes (predominantly mononucleosomes) were used (supplemental Fig. S3). For the preparation of demethylated nucleosomes, HEK293 cells were treated with 2 μm 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (Sigma-Aldrich) for 72 h (corresponding to three cell divisions under these conditions), and the cells were allowed to recover for another 48 h in medium without 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine. From these cells, nucleosomes were prepared as described above. For GST pulldown experiments, 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) were incubated with 20 μg of GST-tagged PWWP domain of Dnmt3a or mutant domain for 1 h at 4 °C in the interaction buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100). Then the beads were washed once with interaction buffer and blocked with interaction buffer containing 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 4 °C. 35 μg of native histones or 100 μg of native oligonucleosomes were added to the beads in interaction buffer and incubated for 3 h. Finally, the beads were washed three times with interaction buffer, resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE loading dye, and boiled for 10 min, and the supernatant containing the bound fractions was separated on 16% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was cut in two parts. The lower part (<20 kDa) was probed with anti-H3K36me3 antibody (Abcam ab9050), and the upper part was probed with anti-GST antibody (GE Healthcare) to provide a gel loading control (supplemental Fig. S4, A and B). For the specificity analysis, the beads were loaded with GST-tagged PWWP domain and incubated with native oligonucleosomes in interaction buffer as described above, washed three times with washing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 0.1% Triton X-100), resuspended in 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer and boiled for 10 min. The supernatant was split equally and loaded on 16% SDS-PAGE gels. The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and probed with different modification specific histone antibodies: anti-H3K36me3 (Abcam ab9050), anti-H3K9me3 (Active Motif 39161), anti-H3K4me3 (Active Motif 39159), and anti-H3K27me3 (Active Motif 39535). Equal loading of bound fractions was confirmed by Ponceau S staining of the blot prior to the antibody staining (supplemental Fig. S4C). HEK293 and NIH3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal calf serum at 37 °C at 5% CO2. The NIH3T3 cells were seeded in coverslips and transfected with EYFP-Dnmt3a or EYFP-Dnmt3a-D329A mutant constructs using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Two days after transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded with Mowiol (Carl Roth). Confocal images were taken using a Zeiss LSM 510 Meta instrument (software version 3.0) and 63× oil immersion objective. An argon laser line at 514 nm was used to excite EYFP fluorescence, and a BP530–550 filter was used for image recording. Fluorescence microscopy pictures were taken using an AXIOPLAN2 microscope equipped with AxioCam HRc camera and Achroplan 100× oil immersion objective with filter sets 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole FT395/LP420 and green fluorescent protein BP450–490/FT510 (all from Carl Zeiss). The methylation reactions were performed with either Dnmt3a2 enzyme, Dnmt3a2-D329A mutant, or Dnmt3a-CD in methylation buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, and 50 mm KCl) containing 0.75 μm radioactively labeled S-adenosyl-l-methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and 1 μg of demethylated native chromatin in 25 μl of total reaction volume. Additional methylation experiments were conducted in the presence of anti-H3K36me3 antibody (Abcam ab9050), anti-H3K9me3 antibody (Active Motif 39161), anti-H3K4me3 antibody (Active Motif 39159), or anti-H3K27me3 antibody (Active Motif 39535) all in 1:5000 final dilution. The methylation reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h, and the reactions were stopped by the addition of excess of unlabeled S-adenosyl-l-methionine. Then the reaction mixtures were subjected to proteinase K (New England Biolabs) digestion at 42 °C for 2 h, and the nucleic acids in the reaction mixture were purified using Nucleospin PCR purification (Machery Nagel). The amount of radioactivity incorporated into the DNA was measured by liquid scintillation counting and normalized with respect to the total amount of DNA as determined by UV spectroscopy. Methylation of biotinylated oligonucleotide substrates by Dnmt3a2 and its variants was studied by measuring the transfer of titrated methyl groups from labeled S-adenosyl-l-methionine into biotinylated oligonucleotides (Bt-GAG AAG CTG GGA CTT CCG GGA GGA GAG TGC/GCA CTC TCC TCC CGG AAG TCC CAG CTT CTC) using the avidin-biotin methylation assay as described (22Jurkowska R.Z.

Chem. 2000; 381: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). To investigate whether the Dnmt3a PWWP domain interacts with modified histone peptides, we employed two different modified histone tail peptide arrays containing in total more than 1000 peptides in various combinations of known and hypothetical modification states of the H3, H4, H2A, and H2B tails. We repeatedly observed that the GST-tagged PWWP domain of Dnmt3a interacted with the histone H3 K36 trimethylation mark with high specificity (Fig. 1). Binding to trimethylated lysine usually involves hydrophobic cages, which often have an acidic residue nearby (19Taverna S.D. Li H. Ruthenburg A.J. Allis C.D. Patel D.J. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2007; 14: 1025-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (1189) Google Scholar). Because the PWWP domains from Dnmt3a and 3b share high amino acid homology, we used the structure of the Dnmt3b PWWP domain (31Qiu C. Sawada K. Zhang X. Cheng X. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 217-224PubMed Google Scholar) to model the structure of the Dnmt3a PWWP domain and identify such potential binding pockets next to Glu290 and Asp329 (supplemental Fig. S1). Trying to disrupt the histone interaction of PWWP, we mutated Glu290 and Asp329 to alanine. These residues are both exposed on the surface of the Dnmt3a PWWP structural model, suggesting that their exchange will not affect the overall domain structure. We did not mutate the buried hydrophobic residues of the predicted pockets to avoid effects on protein folding and stability. The mutant domain proteins could be expressed and purified with similar yields as the wild type domain (supplemental Fig. S2A), and CD spectroscopy confirmed the wild type-like folding of the D329A mutant domain (supplemental Fig. S2B). Binding experiments on peptide arrays showed that there was no significant change in the peptide interaction of the E290A variant, but the D329A variant had completely lost its ability to bind specifically to the H3K36me3 peptide (Fig. 1B). Recently, the structure of the Eaf3 chromo barrel domain was solved in complex with an H3K36me2 analog (32Xu C. Cui G. Botuyan M.V. Mer G. Structure. 2008; 16: 1740-1750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Over 144 backbone atoms comprising the conserved β-barrel and the adjacent α-helix fold, the Eaf3 chromo barrel domain structure could be superimposed with the mouse Dnmt3b PWWP domain structure with a root mean square deviation of 1.37 Å (supplemental Fig. S1). The overlay positioned the methylated Lys36 residue immediately adjacent to Asp329 in the Dnmt3a PWWP domain model. This observation indicates that the biochemical data obtained here are compatible with the structural results obtained with related domains. Furthermore, the Asp329 residue is close to the Ser333 residue (supplemental Fig. S1), mutation of which leads to loss of heterochromatic localization (18Ge Y.Z. Pu M.T. Gowher H. Wu H.P. Ding J.P. Jeltsch A. Xu G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25447-25454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The interaction of the PWWP domain with H3K36me3 was confirmed by fluorescence depolarization using a fluorescently labeled H3 26–44 K36me3 peptide (Fig. 1C). The binding constant was determined as 64 μm, which is weak but in the range of results observed with other individual chromatin-binding domains, like BHC80 Plant Homeodomain like domain binding to H3K4me0 peptide: 33 μm (33Lan F. Collins R.E. De Cegli R. Alpatov R. Horton J.R. Shi X. Gozani O. Cheng X. Shi Y. Nature. 2007; 448: 718-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), L3MBTL1 to the H3K9me1 peptide: 26 μm (34Kalakonda N. Fischle W. Boccuni P. Gurvich N. Hoya-Arias R. Zhao X. Miyata Y. Macgrogan D. Zhang J. Sims J.K. Rice J.C. Nimer S.D. Oncogene. 2008; 27: 4293-4304Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), BRD2 bromodomain 1 to the H4K5ac/K12ac peptide: 360 μm (35Umehara T. Nakamura Y. Jang M.K. Nakano K. Tanaka A. Ozato K. Padmanabhan B. Yokoyama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 7610-7618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and Brd4 bromodomain 1 binding to H3K14ac: 118 μm (36Vollmuth F. Blankenfeldt W. Geyer M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 36547-36556Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Peptide binding of the PWWP-D329A variant was at least five times weaker (data not shown). To assess the binding specificity, binding was competed with unmodified H3 26–44 peptide (Fig. 1D). We observed that at a 5-fold excess of competitor only 20% of binding was lost, corresponding to a 25-fold preference for binding to the methylated peptide. The PWWP-H3K36m3 interaction was also confirmed by pulldown experiments. The GST-PWWP domain of Dnmt3a was able to pull down native nucleosomes isolated from human cells, which contained the H3K36me3 mark (Fig. 2A and supplemental Figs. S3A and 4A). In contrast, the PWWP-D329A mutant completely failed to interact with nucleosomes (Fig. 2A and supplemental Fig. S4A). In addition to H3K36me3, the nucleosome fraction bound by the PWWP domain was also enriched with H3K9me3, but the amounts of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 were reduced in comparison with H3K36me3 (Fig. 2B). The relative reduction in the amounts of H3K4me3 and K27me3 indicates that the pulldown is specific. The presence of the H3K9me3 mark in the pull down was expected on the basis of the overlapping distribution profiles of the H3K36me3 and H3K9me3 marks across transcribed chromatin (37Vakoc C.R. Sachdeva M.M. Wang H. Blobel G.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 9185-9195Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Using native histones isolated from human cells (supplemental Fig. S3B), we observed that the GST-PWWP domain of Dnmt3a, but not its D329A mutant, interacted with histone H3K36me3 mark (Fig. 2C and supplemental Fig. S4B), indicating that the interaction does not require DNA. We investigated the subnuclear distribution of the EYFP-fused Dnmt3a and its D329A mutant in NIH3T3 cells after transient expression of the proteins. Both proteins were located in the nucleus, which was expected because the nuclear localization signals of Dnmt3a are outside of the PWWP domain (17Chen T. Tsujimoto N. Li E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9048-9058Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Within the nucleus, Dnmt3a was found in large spots corresponding to 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole-stained heterochromatin as reported earlier (17Chen T. Tsujimoto N. Li E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9048-9058Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 18Ge Y.Z. Pu M.T. Gowher H. Wu H.P. Ding J.P. Jeltsch A. Xu G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25447-25454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 and supplemental Fig. S5). In contrast, the mutant protein was found more homogenously distributed in the nucleus, indicating a partial loss of heterochromatic localization. This result suggests that the interaction of PWWP with K36me3 is important for the localization of Dnmt3a to heterochromatin. The influence of the PWWP-H3K36me3 interaction on the methylation of nucleosomal DNA by Dnmt3a was investigated using native nucleosomes from human cells prepared after treatment of the cells with 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine. This treatment reduces DNA methylation at unique sequences and repeats by more than 50% (15Zhang Y. Rohde C. Tierling S. Jurkowski T.P. Bock C. Santacruz D. Ragozin S. Reinhardt R. Groth M. Walter J. Jeltsch A. PLoS Genet. 2009; 5e1000438Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 38Rohde C. Zhang Y. Stamerjohanns H. Hecher K. Reinhardt R. Jeltsch A. BioTechniques. 2009; 47: 781-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The native nucleosomes carry their endogenous histone modification pattern and partially demethylated DNA. This experimental design allowed us to study the methylation activity of Dnmt3a using a substrate that mimics the in vivo situation. Demethylated nucleosomes were methylated with Dnmt3a2, a shorter isoform of Dnmt3a lacking the N-terminal variable region (23Chen T. Ueda Y. Xie S. Li E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 38746-38754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar), the Dnmt3a2 D329A mutant (Dnmt3a2-D329A), and the catalytic domain of Dnmt3a (Dnmt3a-CD) using radioactively labeled S-adenosyl-l-methionine as cofactor. The amounts of Dnmt3a2, Dnmt3a2-D329A, and Dnmt3a-CD enzymes used in the nucleosome methylation experiments were normalized to have similar activity on oligonucleotide substrates (supplemental Fig. S6). Using the native chromatin as substrate, we observed that Dnmt3a2 is ∼2.5-fold more active than Dnmt3a-CD (Fig. 4 and supplemental Fig. S6). The Dnmt3a2 enzyme containing the mutated D329A-PWWP domain, which fails to interact with the H3K36me3 mark, only showed a basal level of activity similar to Dnmt3a-CD (Fig. 4). To confirm that the increase in activity of the wild type Dnmt3a2 is due to the PWWP-H3K36me3 interaction, we performed the chromatin methylation experiments in the presence of an anti-H3K36me3 antibody. Although the addition of the anti-H3K36me3 antibody had no effect on the activity of Dnmt3a2-D329A or Dnmt3a-CD, it decreased the activity of Dnmt3a2 to a basal level, similar to the level of activity observed with the Dnmt3a2-D329A or Dnmt3a-CD (Fig. 4). Additional unrelated antibodies used as controls had no effect or a very weak effect on the catalytic activity of Dnmt3a2 (supplemental Fig. S6). Taken together, these results demonstrate that the PWWP domain-H3K36me3 interaction increases the activity of Dnmt3a2 for methylation of native nucleosomal DNA. We show here that the Dnmt3a PWWP domain specifically interacts with H3 tails containing the K36me3 mark. Peptide binding is weak but in the range of binding constants seen with other individual domains interacting with histone peptides. In the cell binding may be further supported by an interaction of the PWWP domain with DNA, because the Lys36 position of the H3 tail is very close to the DNA, such that the PWWP domain could interact with both epitopes simultaneously. Interestingly, the DNA binding and peptide binding properties of the PWWP domains from Dnmt3a and 3b seem to be inverse; we detected peptide binding of the Dnmt3a-PWWP domain but not for Dnmt3b (data not shown), whereas DNA binding of the Dnmt3b-PWWP domain has been reported to be stronger than that of Dnmt3a (17Chen T. Tsujimoto N. Li E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9048-9058Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). We show that the H3K36me3-PWWP interaction mediates chromatin binding, because the heterochromatic localization of Dnmt3a was disturbed in the D329A mutant, which no longer binds to H3K36me3. Targeting of Dnmt3a by an H3K36me3-PWWP interaction is in agreement with previous results showing that the Dnmt3a PWWP domain is necessary for heterochromatic localization of Dnmt3a (17Chen T. Tsujimoto N. Li E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9048-9058Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 18Ge Y.Z. Pu M.T. Gowher H. Wu H.P. Ding J.P. Jeltsch A. Xu G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25447-25454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In contrast, the ADD domain of Dnmt3a, which binds to H3 tails unmethylated at Lys4 (11Otani J. Nankumo T. Arita K. Inamoto S. Ariyoshi M. Shirakawa M. EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 1235-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 12Zhang Y. Jurkowska R. Soeroes S. Rajavelu A. Dhayalan A. Bock I. Rathert P. Brandt O. Reinhardt R. Fischle W. Jeltsch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; (in press)Google Scholar), does not have a role in heterochromatic localization (17Chen T. Tsujimoto N. Li E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9048-9058Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 18Ge Y.Z. Pu M.T. Gowher H. Wu H.P. Ding J.P. Jeltsch A. Xu G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25447-25454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). We show that the PWWP-H3K36me3 interaction stimulates the methylation activity of Dnmt3a on chromatin-bound DNA isolated from human cells, because the catalytic activity of the D329A mutant dropped to levels similar to the isolated catalytic domain. This result suggests an important role for the PWWP domain in guiding DNA methylation to chromatin carrying the H3K36me3 mark, which is in agreement with the observation that the PWWP domain is required for the activity of Dnmt3a in the cell (17Chen T. Tsujimoto N. Li E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9048-9058Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 39Shikauchi Y. Saiura A. Kubo T. Niwa Y. Yamamoto J. Murase Y. Yoshikawa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 1944-1958Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This model is further supported by the observation that the genome-wide distribution of DNA methylation is very similar to that of K36me3 methylation. Many studies have found that H3K36me3 accumulates in euchromatin in the body of active genes, and its distribution is anticorrelated with H3K4me3 (37Vakoc C.R. Sachdeva M.M. Wang H. Blobel G.A. Mol.

The strong correlation of DNA methylation, absence of H3K4me3, and presence of H3K36me3 were also observed in two recent genome-wide studies (14Meissner A. Mikkelsen T.S. Gu H. Wernig M. Hanna J.

Additionally, a correlation of H3K36me3 and DNA methylation was observed at exon-intron boundaries where exons were shown to have increased levels of both H3K36me3 (46Kolasinska-Zwierz P. Down T. Latorre I. Liu T. Liu X.S. Ahringer J. Nat. Genet. 2009; 41: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar) and DNA methylation (16Hodges E. Smith A.D. Kendall J. Xuan Z. Ravi K. Rooks M. Zhang M.Q. Ye K. Bhattacharjee A. Brizuela L. McCombie W.R. Wigler M. Hannon G.J. Hicks J.B. Genome Res. 2009; 19: 1593-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Like DNA methylation, H3K36me3 is a silencing mark that recruits histone deacetylation and represses intragenic transcriptional initiation (47Lee J.S. Shilatifard A. Mutat Res. 2007; 618: 130-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Consequently, the Smyd2 histone methlyltransferase (which generates K36me2) has a repressive effect on reporter gene expression (48Brown M.A. Sims 3rd, R.J. Gottlieb P.D. Tucker P.W. Mol. Cancer. 2006; 5: 26Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). In Schizosaccharomyces pombe the Set2 histone methyltransferase methylates histone H3 lysine 36 at repeat loci during the S phase (49Chen E.S. Zhang K. Nicolas E. Cam H.P. Zofall M. Grewal S.I. Nature. 2008; 451: 734-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Consequently, heterochromatic H3K36me3 transiently peaks in the S phase and has an important role in the re-establishment of heterochromatin after DNA replication that acts in a pathway parallel to Clr4. It has been proposed that in mammals Dnmt3a contributes to the maintenance of the DNA methylation at highly methylated regions (like repeats) (50Jones P.A. Liang G. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2009; 10: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). H3K36 methylation is an evolutionarily conserved mark, suggesting that a transient methylation of H3K36 might occur in mammalian genomes as well and that transient H3K36 methylation might be one of the modifications that recruit Dnmt3a to heterochromatin. Dnmt3a has been shown to bind tightly to chromatin (9Jeong S. Liang G. Sharma S. Lin J.C. Choi S.H. Han H. Yoo C.B. Egger G. Yang A.S. Jones P.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 5366-5376Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). When combined with the previous findings, our data indicate that there are several mechanisms that contribute to the interaction of Dnmt3a with chromatin; Dnmt3a is engaged in two interactions with the H3 tail, mediated by its ADD domain, which binds to the end of the H3 tail unmodified at Lys4 (11Otani J. Nankumo T. Arita K. Inamoto S. Ariyoshi M. Shirakawa M. EMBO Rep. 2009; 10: 1235-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar, 12Zhang Y. Jurkowska R. Soeroes S. Rajavelu A. Dhayalan A. Bock I. Rathert P. Brandt O. Reinhardt R. Fischle W. Jeltsch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2010; (in press)Google Scholar), and by its PWWP domain, which interacts with H3K36me3 located at the more basal region of the H3 tail (Fig. 4B). The anticorrelation of the H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 marks suggests that in the cell most H3 tails will either bind to both ADD and PWWP or neither of them, such that the targeting effects of both domains are synergistic. In addition, the catalytic domain of Dnmt3a binds to DNA and polymerizes on the DNA (22Jurkowska R.Z. Anspach N. Urbanke C. Jia D. Reinhardt R. Nellen W. Cheng X. Jeltsch A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: 6656-6663Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 51Jia D. Jurkowska R.Z. Zhang X. Jeltsch A. Cheng X. Nature. 2007; 449: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar), and it interacts with many other proteins including Dnmt3L and Dnmt3b (52Li J.Y. Pu M.T. Hirasawa R. Li B.Z. Huang Y.N. Zeng R.

https://openalex.org/W2056813394,"Background Internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (iCBT) for depression is effective when guided by a clinician, less so if unguided. Question: Would guidance from a technician be as effective as guidance from a clinician? Method Randomized controlled non-inferiority trial comparing three groups: Clinician-assisted vs. technician-assisted vs. delayed treatment. Community-based volunteers applied to the VirtualClinic (www.virtualclinic.org.au) research program, and 141 participants with major depressive disorder were randomized. Participants in the clinician- and technician-assisted groups received access to an iCBT program for depression comprising 6 online lessons, weekly homework assignments, and weekly supportive contact over a treatment period of 8 weeks. Participants in the clinician-assisted group also received access to a moderated online discussion forum. The main outcome measures were the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9). Completion rates were high, and at post-treatment, both treatment groups reduced scores on the BDI-II (p<0.001) and PHQ-9 (p<0.001) compared to the delayed treatment group but did not differ from each other. Within group effect sizes on the BDI-II were 1.27 and 1.20 for the clinician- and technician-assisted groups respectively, and on the PHQ-9, were 1.54 and 1.60 respectively. At 4-month follow-up participants in the technician group had made further improvements and had significantly lower scores on the PHQ-9 than those in the clinician group. A total of approximately 60 minutes of clinician or technician time was required per participant during the 8-week treatment program. Conclusions Both clinician- and technician-assisted treatment resulted in large effect sizes and clinically significant improvements comparable to those associated with face-to-face treatment, while a delayed treatment control group did not improve. These results provide support for large scale trials to determine the clinical effectiveness and acceptability of technician-assisted iCBT programs for depression. This form of treatment has potential to increase the capacity of existing mental health services. Trial Registration Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12609000559213"

Risk factors for carrying MRSA ST398 in both animals and humans have not been fully evaluated. In this cross-sectional study, we investigated factors associated with MRSA colonization in veal calves and humans working and living on these farms.A sample of 102 veal calf farms were randomly selected and visited from March 2007-February 2008. Participating farmers were asked to fill in a questionnaire (n = 390) to identify potential risk factors. A nasal swab was taken from each participant. Furthermore, nasal swabs were taken from calves (n = 2151). Swabs were analysed for MRSA by selective enrichment and suspected colonies were confirmed as MRSA by using slide coagulase test and PCR for presence of the mecA-gene. Spa types were identified and a random selection of each spa type was tested with ST398 specific PCR. The Sequence Type of non ST398 strains was determined. Data were analyzed using logistic regression analysis.Human MRSA carriage was strongly associated with intensity of animal contact and with the number of MRSA positive animals on the farm. Calves were more often carrier when treated with antibiotics, while farm hygiene was associated with a lower prevalence of MRSA.This is the first study showing direct associations between animal and human carriage of ST398. The direct associations between animal and human MRSA carriage and the association between MRSA and antimicrobial use in calves implicate prudent use of antibiotics in farm animals."
https://openalex.org/W2124360996,"Extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation is a critical process in tumor cell invasion and requires membrane and released proteases focalized at membrane structures called invadopodia. While extracellular acidification is important in driving tumor invasion, the structure/function mechanisms underlying this regulation are still unknown. Invadopodia are similar in structure and function to osteoclast podosomes responsible for bone degradation, and extracellular acidification is central to podosome action, suggesting that it could also be for invadopodial function. Here, utilizing a novel system for in situ zymography in native matrices, we show that the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (NHE1) and NHE1-generated extracellular acidification are localized at and necessary for invadopodial-dependent ECM degradation, thereby promoting tumor invasion. Stimulation with EGF increased both NHE1-dependent proton secretion and ECM degradation. Manipulation of the NHE1 expression by RNA interference or activity via either transport-deficient mutation or the specific inhibitor cariporide confirmed that NHE1 expression and activity are required for invadopodia-mediated ECM degradation. Taken together, our data show a concordance among NHE1 localization, the generation of a well-defined acidic extracellular pH in the nanospace surrounding invadopodia, and matrix-degrading activity at invadopodia of human malignant breast carcinoma cells, providing a structural basis for the role of NHE1 in invasion and identifying NHE1 as a strategic target for therapeutic intervention."

The enzymatic activity of extracellular TG2 thus appears to be tightly regulated. As TG2 is known to be sensitive to changes in the redox environment, inactivation through oxidation presents a plausible mechanism. Using mass spectrometry, we have identified a redox-sensitive cysteine triad consisting of Cys230, Cys370, and Cys371 that is involved in oxidative inactivation of TG2. Within this triad, Cys370 was found to participate in disulfide bonds with both Cys230 and its neighbor, Cys371. Notably, Ca2+ was found to protect against formation of these disulfide bonds. To investigate the role of each cysteine residue, we created alanine mutants and found that Cys230 appears to promote oxidation and inactivation of TG2 by facilitating formation of Cys370–Cys371 through formation of the Cys230–Cys370 disulfide bond. Although vicinal disulfide pairs are found in several transglutaminase isoforms, Cys230 is unique for TG2, suggesting that this residue acts as an isoform-specific redox sensor.

https://openalex.org/W2092687266,"Background Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) constitute a significant part of infiltrating inflammatory cells that are frequently correlated with progression and poor prognosis of a variety of cancers. Tumor cell-produced human β-defensin-3 (hBD-3) has been associated with TAM trafficking in oral cancer; however, its involvement in tumor-related inflammatory processes remains largely unknown. Methodology The relationship between hBD-3, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), TAMs, and CCR2 was examined using immunofluorescence microscopy in normal and oral carcinoma in situ biopsy specimens. The ability of hBD-3 to chemoattract host macrophages in vivo using a nude mouse model and analysis of hBD-3 on monocytic cell migration in vitro, applying a cross-desensitization strategy of CCR2 and its pharmacological inhibitor (RS102895), respectively, was also carried out. Conclusions/Findings MCP-1, the most frequently expressed tumor cell-associated chemokine, was not produced by tumor cells nor correlated with the recruitment of macrophages in oral carcinoma in situ lesions. However, hBD-3 was associated with macrophage recruitment in these lesions and hBD-3-expressing tumorigenic cells induced massive tumor infiltration of host macrophages in nude mice. HBD-3 stimulated the expression of tumor-promoting cytokines, including interleukin-1α (IL-1α), IL-6, IL-8, CCL18, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in macrophages derived from human peripheral blood monocytes. Monocytic cell migration in response to hBD-3 was inhibited by cross-desensitization with MCP-1 and the specific CCR2 inhibitor, RS102895, suggesting that CCR2 mediates monocyte/macrophage migration in response to hBD-3. Collectively, these results indicate that hBD-3 utilizes CCR2 to regulate monocyte/macrophage trafficking and may act as a tumor cell-produced chemoattractant to recruit TAMs. This novel mechanism is the first evidence of an hBD molecule orchestrating an in vivo outcome and demonstrates the importance of the innate immune system in the development of tumors."
https://openalex.org/W1979104664,"Although Anopheles funestus is difficult to rear, it is crucial to analyse field populations of this malaria vector in order to successfully characterise mechanisms of insecticide resistance observed in this species in Africa. In this study we carried out a large-scale field collection and rearing of An. funestus from Mozambique in order to analyse its susceptibility status to insecticides and to broadly characterise the main resistance mechanisms involved in natural populations.3,000 F(1) adults were obtained through larval rearing. WHO susceptibility assays indicated a very high resistance to pyrethroids with no mortality recorded after 1 h 30 min exposure and less than 50% mortality at 3 h 30 min. Resistance to the carbamate, bendiocarb was also noted, with 70% mortality after 1h exposure. In contrast, no DDT resistance was observed, indicating that no kdr-type resistance was involved. The sequencing of the acetylcholinesterase gene indicated the absence of the G119S and F455W mutations associated with carbamate and organophosphate resistance. This could explain the absence of malathion resistance in this population. Both biochemical assays and quantitative PCR implicated up-regulated P450 genes in pyrethroid resistance, with GSTs playing a secondary role. The carbamate resistance observed in this population is probably conferred by the observed altered AChE with esterases also involved.The high level of pyrethroid resistance in this population despite the cessation of pyrethroid use for IRS in 1999 is a serious concern for resistance management strategies such as rotational use of insecticides. As DDT has now been re-introduced for IRS, susceptibility to DDT needs to be closely monitored to prevent the appearance and spread of resistance to this insecticide."

Because such recurrence was highly unexpected, we investigated the possible relationship of tumor growth with fat injections and with mesenchymal stem/stromal cell like cells which are largely found in fatty tissue.

In cultured astrocytes, we have found that dopamine induces sporadic cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca2+]c) signals. Importantly, we show that the dopamine-induced calcium signaling is receptor-independent in midbrain, cortical, and hippocampal astrocytes. We demonstrate that the calcium signal is initiated by the metabolism of dopamine by monoamine oxidase, which produces reactive oxygen species and induces lipid peroxidation. This stimulates the activation of phospholipase C and subsequent release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum via the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor mechanism.

The neurotransmitter DA is a monoamine that is synthesized in dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra in the midbrain and transferred to the striatum through very fine C-fibers (1Dahlström A. Fuxe K. Experientia. 1964; 20: 398-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 2Kötter R. Prog. Neurobiol. 1994; 44: 163-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Dopaminergic terminals constitute ∼21% of total axon terminals in the striatum and contact mostly dendritic spines and dendritic shafts. The actions of DA are mediated by specific G protein-coupled receptors, which are divided into two major families based on their ability to stimulate (D1-like) or inhibit adenylate cyclase (D2-like). Three human D2-like receptors have been cloned: D2, D3, and D4 (3Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar).

Bakhle Y.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 147 (Suppl. 1): S287-S296Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Activation of D1 and D2 receptors is believed to modulate intracellular calcium levels by a single mechanism, that is, the stimulation of phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis by phospholipase C, resulting in the production of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), which mobilizes intracellular calcium stores (2Kötter R. Prog. Neurobiol. 1994; 44: 163-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 3Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). Other mechanisms of release of Ca2+ from internal stores have also been proposed. DA increases cAMP levels (8Lin C.W. Miller T.R.

In neurons and PC12 cells, DA reduced calcium currents by L-, N-, and P-type calcium channels (3Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar, 9Cantuti-Castelvetri I. Joseph J.A. Free Radic. Biol.

Neuron. 1995; 14: 385-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Reports on the effects of DA on intracellular calcium in astrocytes from different areas of the brain are controversial, and many of the effects cannot be explained solely by the interaction of dopamine with D1/2 receptors (3Missale C. Nash S.R. Robinson S.W. Jaber M. Caron M.G. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 189-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar). The effect of DA on calcium homeostasis in astrocytes is potentially very important, in light of the interplay between neuronal and glial signals in physiology and pathology reported recently (12Haydon P.G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar, 13Abramov A.Y. Canevari L. Duchen M.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5088-5095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Abramov A.Y. Canevari L. Duchen M.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1742: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Mixed cultures of hippocampal, cortical, or midbrain neurones and glial cells were prepared as described previously (13Abramov A.Y. Canevari L. Duchen M.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5088-5095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with modifications, from Sprague-Dawley rat pups 2–4 days postpartum (UCL breeding colony). Hippocampi, cortex, and midbrain were removed into ice-cold HEPES-buffered salt solution (HBSS) (Ca2+/Mg2+-free; Invitrogen). The tissue was minced and trypsinized (0.1% for 15 min at 37 °C), triturated, and plated on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips and cultured in Neurobasal A medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B-27 (Invitrogen) and 2 mml-glutamine. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air for a minimum of 12 days before experimental use to ensure the expression of receptors. Neurons were easily distinguishable from glia: they appeared phase bright, had smooth rounded somata and distinct processes, and lay just above the focal plane of the glial layer. Cells were used at 12–15 days in vitro unless differently stated. Isolated cortical astrocytes were prepared as previously described (15Pavlov E. Aschar-Sobbi R. Campanella M. Turner R.J. Gómez-García M.R. Abramov A.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 9420-9428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Cerebra taken from 2–5-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats. The cerebra were chopped and triturated until homogeneous and trypsinized (50,000 units ml−1 porcine pancreas; Sigma) with 336 units ml−1 DNase I (bovine pancreas; Sigma), and 1.033 units ml−1 collagenase (Sigma) at 37 °C for 15 min. After addition of fetal bovine serum (10% of final volume) and filtering through 140-μm mesh, the tissue was centrifuged through 0.4 m sucrose (400 × g, 10 min), and the resulting pellet was transferred to Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 1 mm malate in tissue culture flasks precoated with 0.01% poly-d-lysine. The cells reached confluence at 12–14 days in vitro and were harvested and reseeded onto 24-mm-diameter glass coverslips, precoated with 0.01% poly-d-lysine for fluorescence measurements and used for 2–4 days. For the MAO-B knockdown experiment, cells were transiently transfected on the 2nd day in vitro using Lipofectamine LTX transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Empty shRNA green fluorescent protein or MAO-B containing lentiviral constructs was purchased from Open Biosystems. Cortical explant cultures were generously provided by Drs. A. V. Gourine and V. Kasymov and prepared as described in Ref. 16Teschemacher A.G. Paton J.F. Kasparov S. Adv. Drug Deliv. Rev. 2005; 57: 79-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar. For measurement of [Ca2+]c, primary astrocytes were loaded for 30 min at room temperature with 5 μm fura-2 AM or fluo-4 AM with/without Rhod-2 and 0.005% pluronic in a HBSS (containing 156 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm MgSO4, 1.25 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose and 10 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.35 with NaOH. Ca2+-free HBSS also contained 0.5 mm EGTA. For measurement of the lipid peroxidation rate, astrocytes were loaded with 5 μm C11-BODIPY (581/591) for 30 min. Fluorescence measurements were obtained on an epifluorescence inverted microscope equipped with a 20× fluorite objective. [Ca2+]c and plasmalemmal membrane potential were monitored in single cells using excitation light provided by a xenon arc lamp, the beam passing monochromator at 340, 380, and 490 nm (Cairn Research, Kent, UK). Emitted fluorescence light was reflected through a 515-nm longpass filter to a cooled CCD camera (Retiga; QImaging) and digitized to 12-bit resolution. All imaging data were collected and analyzed using software from Andor (Belfast, UK). Traces, obtained using the cooled CCD imaging system, are presented as the ratio of excitation at 340 and 380 nm, both with emission at >515 nm. For some measurements, [Ca2+]c was calculated using the equation (17Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) [Ca2+]c = K(R − Rmin)/(Rmax − R), where R is the fluorescence ratio (340 nm/380 nm) and K is the effective dissociation constant of fura-2. Rmax and Rmin were determined by application of 50 μm digitonin followed by 1 mm MnCl2. Confocal images were obtained using a Zeiss 510 UV-visible CLSM equipped with a META detection system and a 40× oil immersion objective. The 488-nm argon laser line was used to excite fluo-4, which was measured using a bandpass filter from 505–550 nm. For Rhod-2 measurements, the 543-nm laser line and 560-nm longpass filter were used. Illumination intensity was kept to a minimum (at 0.1–0.2% of laser output) to avoid phototoxicity and the pinhole set to give an optical slice of ∼2 μm. C11-BODIPY (581/591) was excited using the 488- and 543-nm laser line and fluorescence measured using a bandpass filter from 505–550-nm and 560-nm longpass filter. All data presented were obtained from at least five coverslips and two or three different cell preparations. Where indicated, solvent-only control or DA-free controls were used. To measure cell viability, cells were loaded simultaneously with 20 μm propidium iodide (which is excluded from viable cells but exhibits a red fluorescence following a loss of membrane integrity in nonviable cells) and 4.5 μm Hoechst 33342 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), which labels nuclei blue, to count the total number of cells. Each experiment was repeated four times using independent cultures. Statistical analysis was performed with the aid of Origin 8 (Microcal Software Inc., Northampton, MA) software. Means ± S.E. are expressed. Application of DA (20 μm) to astrocytes in culture produced a complex fluctuation in [Ca2+]c shown in Fig. 1A. There was no observable difference in the DA-induced Ca2+ signal in primary cortical, midbrain, or hippocampal astrocyte cultures, and the data shown are from experiments using cortical astrocytes, except where stated differently. To investigate the concentration of DA required to induce a Ca2+ signal, DA was applied in the concentration range of 0.1–100 μm to cultured astrocytes (Fig. 1B). Low concentrations of DA were sufficient to induce an increase in the [Ca2+]c, and the amplitude of the DA-induced Ca2+ signal (50–400 nm) was dependent on the concentration of DA applied (Fig. 1B). We observed and characterized three major types of DA-induced Ca2+ responses in astrocytes: (i) single spikes with amplitude in the peak 200–300 nm (Fig. 1Di), (ii) low amplitude 150–250 nm oscillations (Fig. 1Dii), (iii) broad single peak of 400–500 nm (Fig. 1Diii). We quantified the proportion of astrocytes exhibiting each type of DA-induced Ca2+ signal (Fig. 1C). The majority of astrocytes respond to DA (20 μm) either with single spikes (46.8 ± 4.5% astrocytes) or low amplitude oscillations (40.7 ± 3.9% astrocytes). Fewer than one-fifth showed a broad single peak (12.5 ± 3.9% astrocytes) (Fig. 1C). After washing the cells with DA-free saline, the Ca2+ responses persisted for up to 5 min (n = 38; data not shown). The DA-induced increase in [Ca2+]c (measured by the fluo-4 fluorescence) stimulates transient Ca2+ uptake in mitochondria, resulting in an increase in mitochondrial [Ca2+] as measured by Rhod-2 fluorescence (n = 29; Fig. 1E). This mitochondrial calcium uptake is typical for physiological calcium stimuli in astrocytes. As responses like these have not been described previously, we were concerned that the properties of cells might be dictated by our culture conditions. We therefore repeated the experiments using cortical explant cultures, in which the properties of the tissue in vivo are well retained. Confocal imaging of explant cultures loaded with fluo-4 demonstrated that exposure to DA (20 μm) provoked an increase in Ca2+ signaling in glial cells within the culture (Fig. 1F). (The neurons in the explants culture were identified as the only cells in the culture to show a rise in [Ca2+]c with 50 mm KCl (data not shown).) We sought to investigate the mechanism of the DA-induced Ca2+ signal. It has been shown previously that the signaling effects of DA on astrocytes are mediated by D1- and D2-like receptors (18Liu J. Wang F. Huang C. Long L.H. Wu W.N. Cai F. Wang J.H. Ma L.Q. Chen J.G. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 2009; 29: 317-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 19Zhang X. Zhou Z. Wang D. Li A. Yin Y. Gu X. Ding F. Zhen X. Zhou J. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 7766-7775Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). We therefore measured the DA-induced Ca2+ signal in cells loaded with fura-2 in the presence and absence of DA receptor antagonists. Application of the antagonist for D2-like receptors (20 μm sulpiride) did not prevent the DA-induced Ca2+ response in astrocytes (n = 157; Fig. 2A). Similarly, application of the D1/D5 antagonist (20 μm SCH-23390) did not block the DA-induced Ca2+ response (n = 171; Fig. 2B). D1/D5 or D2 antagonists did not significantly change amplitude of the DA-induced Ca2+ signal in astrocytes. All three classes of DA-induced Ca2+ responses were observed in the presence of receptor antagonists. Furthermore, application of the receptor antagonists did not alter the proportion of cells exhibiting each type of DA-induced Ca2+ response (Fig. 2C). The responses to DA were also not significantly affected by inhibitors of either ionotropic or metabotropic glutamate receptors, including 10 μm MK-801 (n = 29 cells; Fig. 2D), 20 μm CNQX (n = 34 cells; Fig. 2E), or 50 μm (S)-MCPG (n = 32 cells; data not shown), suggesting that the responses do not reflect glutamate release into the culture. We investigated the source of the Ca2+ in the DA-induced Ca2+ signal in astrocytes. Application of DA to primary cortical cell co-cultures in Ca2+-free medium did not prevent the Ca2+ signal in astrocytes (Fig. 3A). This suggests that the DA-induced Ca2+ signal in astrocytes is dependent on intracellular Ca2+. However, the absence of extracellular Ca2+ delayed the onset of the signal in astrocytes (n = 80); the time from application of dopamine to the appearance of Ca2+ signal was 120–180 s (Fig. 3A, compared with immediate onset of Ca2+ signal in Fig. 1A). Incubation of primary co-cultures with 0.5 μm thapsigargin (an inhibitor of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca2+ pumps) depleted Ca2+ from the ER and completely prevented the DA-induced [Ca2+]c changes in astrocytes (n = 52 astrocytes; Fig. 3B). This confirmed that the astrocytic DA-induced Ca2+ signal is dependent on intracellular stores. U73122 is an inhibitor of phospholipase C. Application of U73122 completely prevented the astrocytic DA-induced Ca2+ signal (n = 73; Fig. 3C). Furthermore, application of 2-APB (n = 27 cells), an inhibitor of IP3-dependent ER Ca2+ release, also blocked the DA-induced Ca2+ signal in astrocytes (Fig. 3D). Although the expression and role of ryanodine receptors in astrocytes is controversial (20Matyash M. Matyash V. Nolte C. Sorrentino V. Kettenmann H. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we tested the effect of the ryanodine receptor inhibitor dantrolene (10 μm), which produced no significant effect on the DA-induced Ca2+ signal (n = 39; data not shown). Taken together, these experiments suggest that in astrocytes, DA activates phospholipase C, inducing IP3-dependent Ca2+ release from ER, resulting in a rise in intracellular Ca2+. It has been reported that activation of phospholipase C and IP3-dependent ER Ca2+ release can be initiated by stimulation of P2-purinergic receptors (21Peuchen S. Clark J.B. Duchen M.R. Neuroscience. 1996; 71: 871-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, incubation of primary cultures of astrocytes with the P2-purinergic receptor antagonist 20 μm PPADS (pyridoxalphosphate-6-azo(benzene-2,4-disulfonic acid) tetrasodium salt hydrate) did not affect the DA induced [Ca2+]c changes in astrocytes (n = 29; data not shown). Therefore, DA does not activate phospholipase C via P2-purinergic receptors. As mentioned earlier, incubation of astrocytes in calcium-free medium (Ca2+-free HBSS + 0.5 mm EGTA) induced a delay in the DA-induced Ca2+ signal in astrocytes. To exclude involvement of extracellular Ca2+ in the DA-induced Ca2+ signal we employed the method of manganese quench of fura-2 fluorescence. Extracellular Mn2+ enters cells via open Ca2+-permeate channels and quenches the fluorescence of intracellular fura-2. This is most readily seen when the fura-2 is excited at ∼360 nm, the Ca2+-independent (isosbestic) point of the fura-2 excitation spectrum (whereas the Ca2+-dependent change of the 340/380 nm ratio is not altered by Mn2+). The DA-induced Ca2+ spikes in astrocytes (n = 62) (which were recorded as high increases in the fura-2 ratio signal) induced only a small decrease in 360-nm fluorescence in the presence of Mn2+ (Fig. 3E). This experiment confirmed that extracellular Ca2+ does not play a role in the DA-induced [Ca2+]c responses. The small changes in 360-nm signal in astrocytes (Fig. 3E) may be explained by the opening of store-operated Ca2+ channels. We tested the role of DA metabolism on the DA-induced Ca2+ signal. Monoamine oxidase is the enzyme responsible for utilization of DA in the brain (7Youdim M.B. Bakhle Y.S. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2006; 147 (Suppl. 1): S287-S296Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Preincubation (5 min) of astrocytes with the inhibitor of MAO, selegiline (20 μm inhibits both isoforms MAO-A and MAO-B) completely blocked the DA-induced Ca2+ signal in astrocytes (n = 142 astrocytes; Fig. 4A). Tyramine may be used as another substrate for MAO. Addition of 50 μm tyramine induced DA-like changes in the astrocyte Ca2+ signal (n = 29 cells; Fig. 4B), suggesting that the activity of MAO is necessary for the DA-induced Ca2+ signal. To confirm the involvement of MAO in the DA-induced Ca2+ signal in astrocytes, we performed MAO-shRNA in midbrain co-cultures. Application of DA (20 μm) to cells with MAO knockdown did not produce a Ca2+ signal in astrocytes (n = 21; Fig. 4C). MAO catalyzes DA using FAD and produces H2O2 and aldehyde. To test whether the Ca2+ signal was due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by MAO, we applied MnTBAP, a scavenger of ROS, to astrocytes in the presence of DA. Pre-incubation of primary co-cultures with 50 μm MnTBAP (a superoxide dismutase mimic and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) scavenger) had no effect on the DA-induced [Ca2+]c responses in astrocytes (n = 67 cells; Fig. 4D). However, incubation of cells with an antioxidant that inhibits lipid peroxidation, 100 μm Trolox (water-soluble vitamin E analog), was effective in inhibiting the DA-induced Ca2+ signal in astrocytes (n = 81 cells; Fig. 4E). It should be noted that Trolox is a water-soluble antioxidant and can be effective at ROS scavenging in the cytosol. 50-min preincubation of the cells with 100 μm vitamin E (α-tocopherol) also completely prevented the DA-induced Ca2+ signal in astrocytes (n = 49; data not shown). To test whether DA affects lipid peroxidation, we employed the specific indicator C11-BODIPY (581/591), which allows live changes in the rate of lipid peroxidation in live cells to be measured. Addition of 20 μm DA induced a rapid increase in the rate of lipid peroxidation in astrocytes (signal rose to 315.3 ± 26% of basal rate, p < 0.001; n = 36 cells; Fig. 4F). The effect of DA on lipid peroxidation was induced by the activation of MAO as it could be blocked by application of the MAO inhibitor selegiline 20 μm (rate of C11-BODIPY (581/591) oxidation dropped from 315.3 ± 26% to 95.3 ± 6.2% of basal rate; Fig. 4F). Considering the differences in the effect of MnTBAP and vitamin E on DA-induced Ca2+ signaling, we also tested the effect of these two antioxidants on DA-stimulated lipid peroxidation. Pretreatment of astrocytes with α-tocopherol (100 μm, 20 min) completely prevented the increase in the rate of DA-induced lipid peroxidation (108.6 ± 6.8% of basal rate C11-BODIPY (581/591) oxidation, n = 27; Fig. 4F). Exposure of astrocytes with 50 μm MnTBAP (20 min before and during the time of experiment) did not abolish DA-induced lipid peroxidation but did result in a reduction in the rate of peroxidation. The rate of C11-BODIPY (581/591) oxidation in cells treated with MnTBAP rose to 231.4 ± 28.3% in response to DA (n = 34; p < 0.001; Fig. 4F). Thus, MnTBAP is not as effective against DA-induced lipid peroxidation as α-tocopherol, and this may underlie the difference in the of vitamin E and MnTBAP on the DA-induced Ca2+ signal. Thus, activation of MAO in astrocytes by DA induces lipid peroxidation which leads to the stimulation of phospholipase C and IP3-induced calcium release from ER. The in vivo concentration of DA is not well established, and different authors report physiological ranges of DA concentration in the nanomolar to millimolar range. To establish whether the concentration of DA that induces a Ca2+ signal in astrocytes is pathological, we studied the effect of different concentrations of DA (0–500 μm) on the viability of astrocytes. Prolonged (24-h) exposure of 5–50 μm DA did not significantly increase the number of cell death in primary cultures of cortical astrocytes (Fig. 5) compared with control. Only high concentrations of DA (100 μm and 500 μm) produced a significant increase in cell death (from 14.3 ± 2.9% in control to 27.8 ± 3.9% for 100 μm of DA; p < 0.01; and to 73.6 ± 5.5% for 500 μm; p < 0.001; n = 3, Fig. 5). Thus, the changes in [Ca2+]c in astrocytes in response to the concentrations of DA used in these experiments are not reflected in pathological processes in cells. Our findings suggest novel effects of DA on calcium signaling in astrocytes. Astrocytes and neurons are likely to communicate both physiologically and in disease. Physiologically, calcium signals in astrocytes cause cerebrovascular constrictions (22Mulligan S.J. MacVicar B.A. Nature. 2004; 431: 195-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar, 23Gordon G.R. Choi H.B. Rungta R.L. Ellis-Davies G.C. MacVicar B.A. Nature. 2008; 456: 745-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Neurotoxicity in neurodegenerative disease may be mediated by astrocyte-neuronal interactions. For example, β-amyloid induces a calcium signal in astrocytes which results in overproduction of ROS, reduction of antioxidant levels, and cell death in neurons (12Haydon P.G. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 185-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (1154) Google Scholar, 13Abramov A.Y. Canevari L. Duchen M.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 5088-5095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Abramov A.Y. Canevari L. Duchen M.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1742: 81-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In this study, we have demonstrated that metabolism of nontoxic concentrations of DA by MAO in astrocytes produces hydrogen peroxide, which activates lipid peroxidation in the neighboring membranes. Lipid peroxidation activates phospholipase C, releasing IP3 and inducing a Ca2+ signal. Although ROS have been extensively implicated in causing oxidative damage in neurodegenerative disease, there is emerging evidence that ROS also acts as a physiological mediator of normal cellular function. The cellular redox state and ROS may stimulate as well as inhibit Ca2+ channels and Ca2+ pumps and thus modulate Ca2+ signaling (24Feissner R.F. Skalska J. Gaum W.E. Sheu S.S. Front. Biosci. 2009; 14: 1197-1218Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). To our knowledge this is a first evidence of the involvement of ROS in a calcium signaling pathway in response to a physiological stimulus such as dopamine transmission in the brain. Increased levels of oxidative stress in the brain may be critical for the initiation of glutamate or ATP release, which acts as a trigger for Ca2+ signaling (25Avshalumov M.V. Rice M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2003; 100: 11729-11734Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 26Gonzalez-Islas C. Hablitz J.J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 867-875Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27González A. Granados M.P. Pariente J.A. Salido G.M. Neurochem. Res. 2006; 31: 741-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In skeletal and cardiac muscle, ROS is known to induce a calcium signal via activation of the ryanodine receptor (28Hidalgo C. Bull R. Marengo J.J. Perez C.F. Donoso P. Biol. Res. 2000; 33: 113-124PubMed Google Scholar). However, we have shown that this mechanism is not involved in DA-induced [Ca2+]c changes because the astrocytic calcium signal was insensitive to inhibitors of glutamate, purinergic, or ryanadine receptors (see above). DA can produce ROS via both enzymatic (H2O2) and nonenzymatic metabolism (H2O2, superoxide) (29Chinta S.J. Andersen J.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1780: 1362-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). However, the effect of the MAO inhibitor selegiline and the effect of MAO-shRNA confirmed the role of enzymatic ROS production on lipid peroxidation and the induction of calcium signaling in astrocytes. We have shown for the first time that DA produces effects on Ca2+ signaling that are not mediated by the known receptors. Of note, this is the first demonstration of Ca2+ signaling in astrocytes mediated by ROS. We believe that this DA-induced Ca2+ signal may play an important role in dopamine signaling in human brain.

https://openalex.org/W2130162375,"A new strategy has emerged to improve healing of bone defects using exogenous glycosaminoglycans by increasing the effectiveness of bone-anabolic growth factors. Wnt ligands play an important role in bone formation. However, their functional interactions with heparan sulfate/heparin have only been investigated in non-osseous tissues. Our study now shows that the osteogenic activity of Wnt3a is cooperatively stimulated through physical interactions with exogenous heparin. N-Sulfation and to a lesser extent O-sulfation of heparin contribute to the physical binding and optimal co-stimulation of Wnt3a. Wnt3a-heparin signaling synergistically increases osteoblast differentiation with minimal effects on cell proliferation. Thus, heparin selectively reduces the effective dose of Wnt3a needed to elicit osteogenic, but not mitogenic responses. Mechanistically, Wnt3a-heparin signaling strongly activates the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway and requires the bone-related transcription factor RUNX2 to stimulate alkaline phosphatase activity, which parallels canonical beta-catenin signaling. Collectively, our findings establish the osteo-inductive potential of a heparin-mediated Wnt3a-phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt-RUNX2 signaling network and suggest that heparan sulfate supplementation may selectively reduce the therapeutic doses of peptide factors required to promote bone formation."
https://openalex.org/W2087036507,"Age-related skeletal muscle loss is thought to stem from suboptimal nutrition and resistance to anabolic stimuli. Impaired microcirculatory (nutritive) blood flow may contribute to anabolic resistance by reducing delivery of amino acids to skeletal muscle. In this study, we employed contrast-enhanced ultrasound, microdialysis sampling of skeletal muscle interstitium, and stable isotope methodology, to assess hemodynamic and metabolic responses of older individuals to endurance type (walking) exercise during controlled amino acid provision. We hypothesized that older individuals would exhibit reduced microcirculatory blood flow, interstitial amino acid concentrations, and amino acid transport when compared with younger controls. We report for the first time that aging induces anabolic resistance following endurance exercise, manifested as reduced (by ∼40%) efficiency of muscle protein synthesis. Despite lower (by ∼40–45%) microcirculatory flow in the older than in the younger participants, circulating and interstitial amino acid concentrations and phenylalanine transport into skeletal muscle were all equal or higher in older individuals than in the young, comprehensively refuting our hypothesis that amino acid availability limits postexercise anabolism in older individuals. Our data point to alternative mediators of age-related anabolic resistance and importantly suggest correction of these impairments may reduce requirements for, and increase the efficacy of, dietary protein in older individuals.

Here, we report an unprecedented strategy for preparing polylactide-cyclosporine A (PLA-CsA) NPs (termed CsA-NPs) through CsA-initiated ring-opening polymerization of lactide (LA) followed by nanoprecipitation. The resulting CsA-NPs have sub-100 nm sizes and narrow particle size distributions, and release CsA in a sustained manner without a ""burst""-release effect. Both free CsA and CsA-NPs displayed comparable suppression of T-cell proliferation and production of inflammatory cytokines in various T-cell assays in a dose-dependent manner. The IC(50) values for CsA and CsA-NPs were 27.5 and 72.0 ng/ml, respectively. As lymph nodes are the main loci for T-cell activation, we coupled dendritic cells (DCs) with CsA-NPs and successfully delivered CsA selectively to the lymph nodes. Our studies indicated that CsA-NPs could be internalized in the DCs with a sustained release of CsA to the culture medium, suppressing alloreactive T-cell proliferation. Allogeneic DCs loaded with CsA-NPs were able to migrate to the draining lymph nodes where the T-cell priming was significantly reduced without any systemic release. This innovative nanoparticulate CsA delivery technology constitutes a strong basis for future targeted delivery of immunosuppressive drugs with improved efficiency and reduced toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1968966344,"Agonists such as those acting at muscarinic receptors are thought to induce contraction of smooth muscle primarily through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production and release of Ca(2+) from sarcoplasmic reticulum. However, the additional Ca(2+)-mobilizing messengers cyclic adenosine diphosphate ribose (cADPR) and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) may also be involved in this process, the former acting on the sarcoplasmic reticulum, the latter acting on lysosome-related organelles. In this study, we provide the first systematic analysis of the capacity of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, cADPR, and NAADP to cause contraction in smooth muscle. Using permeabilized guinea pig detrusor and taenia caecum, we show that all three Ca(2+)-mobilizing messengers cause contractions in both types of smooth muscle. We demonstrate that cADPR and NAADP play differential roles in mediating contraction in response to muscarinic receptor activation, with a sizeable role for NAADP and acidic calcium stores in detrusor muscle but not in taenia caecum, underscoring the heterogeneity of smooth muscle signal transduction systems. Two-pore channel proteins (TPCs) have recently been shown to be key components of the NAADP receptor. We show that contractile responses to NAADP were completely abolished, and agonist-evoked contractions were reduced and now became independent of acidic calcium stores in Tpcn2(-/-) mouse detrusor smooth muscle. Our findings provide the first evidence that TPC proteins mediate a key NAADP-regulated tissue response brought about by agonist activation of a cell surface receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2101769770,"The gustatory system provides critical information about the quality and nutritional value of food before it is ingested. Thus, physiological mechanisms that modulate taste function in the context of nutritional needs or metabolic status could optimize ingestive decisions. We report that glucagon, which plays important roles in the maintenance of glucose homeostasis, enhances sweet taste responsiveness through local actions in the mouse gustatory epithelium. Using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy, we found that glucagon and its receptor (GlucR) are coexpressed in a subset of mouse taste receptor cells. Most of these cells also express the T1R3 taste receptor implicated in sweet and/or umami taste. Genetic or pharmacological disruption of glucagon signaling in behaving mice indicated a critical role for glucagon in the modulation of taste responsiveness. Scg5−/− mice, which lack mature glucagon, had significantly reduced responsiveness to sucrose as compared to wild-type littermates in brief-access taste tests. No significant differences were seen in responses to prototypical salty, sour, or bitter stimuli. Taste responsiveness to sucrose was similarly reduced upon acute and local disruption of glucagon signaling by the GlucR antagonist L-168,049. Together, these data indicate a role for local glucagon signaling in the peripheral modulation of sweet taste responsiveness.—Elson, A.E.T., Dotson, C.D., Egan, J.M., Munger, S.D.

https://openalex.org/W2125840046,"Background The recent H5N1 avian and H1N1 swine-origin influenza virus outbreaks reaffirm that the threat of a world-wide influenza pandemic is both real and ever-present. Vaccination is still considered the best strategy for protection against influenza virus infection but a significant challenge is to identify new vaccine approaches that offer accelerated production, broader protection against drifted and shifted strains, and the capacity to elicit anti-viral immune responses in the respiratory tract at the site of viral entry. As a safe alternative to live attenuated vaccines, the mucosal and systemic immunogenicity of an H1N1 influenza (A/New Caledonia/20/99) HA DNA vaccine administered by particle-mediated epidermal delivery (PMED or gene gun) was analyzed in rhesus macaques. Methodology/Principal Findings Macaques were immunized at weeks 0, 8, and 16 using a disposable single-shot particle-mediated delivery device designed for clinical use that delivers plasmid DNA directly into cells of the epidermis. Significant levels of hemagglutination inhibiting (HI) antibodies and cytokine-secreting HA-specific T cells were observed in the periphery of macaques following 1–3 doses of the PMED HA DNA vaccine. In addition, HA DNA vaccination induced detectable levels of HA-specific mucosal antibodies and T cells in the lung and gut-associated lymphoid tissues of vaccinated macaques. Importantly, co-delivery of a DNA encoding the rhesus macaque GM-CSF gene was found to significantly enhance both the systemic and mucosal immunogenicity of the HA DNA vaccine. Conclusions/Significance These results provide strong support for the development of a particle-mediated epidermal DNA vaccine for protection against respiratory pathogens such as influenza and demonstrate, for the first time, the ability of skin-delivered GM-CSF to serve as an effective mucosal adjuvant for vaccine induction of immune responses in the gut and respiratory tract."
https://openalex.org/W2047152276,"MAPK phosphatase-1 (DUSP1/MKP-1) is a mitogen and stress-inducible dual specificity protein phosphatase, which can inactivate all three major classes of MAPK in mammalian cells. DUSP1/MKP-1 is implicated in cellular protection against a variety of genotoxic insults including hydrogen peroxide, ionizing radiation, and cisplatin, but its role in the interplay between different MAPK pathways in determining cell death and survival is not fully understood. We have used pharmacological and genetic tools to demonstrate that DUSP1/MKP-1 is an essential non-redundant regulator of UV-induced cell death in mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs). The induction of DUSP1/MKP-1 mRNA and protein in response to UV radiation is mediated by activation of the p38alpha but not the JNK1 or JNK2 MAPK pathways. Furthermore, we identify MSK1 and -2 and their downstream effectors cAMP-response element-binding protein/ATF1 as mediators of UV-induced p38alpha-dependent DUSP1/MKP-1 transcription. Dusp1/Mkp-1 null MEFs display increased signaling through both the p38alpha and JNK MAPK pathways and are acutely sensitive to UV-induced apoptosis. This lethality is rescued by the reintroduction of wild-type DUSP1/MKP-1 and by a mutant of DUSP1/MKP-1, which is unable to bind to either p38alpha or ERK1/2, but retains full activity toward JNK. Importantly, whereas small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of DUSP1/MKP-1 sensitizes wild-type MEFs to UV radiation, DUSP1/MKP-1 knockdown in MEFS lacking JNK1 and -2 does not result in increased cell death. Our results demonstrate that cross-talk between the p38alpha and JNK pathways mediated by induction of DUSP1/MKP-1 regulates the cellular response to UV radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2140992718,"Background The low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-6 (LRP6) is an essential co-receptor for canonical Wnt signaling. Dickkopf 1 (Dkk1), a major secreted Wnt signaling antagonist, binds to LRP6 with high affinity and prevents the Frizzled-Wnt-LRP6 complex formation in response to Wnts. Previous studies have demonstrated that Dkk1 promotes LRP6 internalization and degradation when it forms a ternary complex with the cell surface receptor Kremen. Methodology/Principal Findings In the present study, we found that transfected Dkk1 induces LRP6 accumulation while inhibiting Wnt/LRP6 signaling. Treatment with Dkk1-conditioned medium or recombinant Dkk1 protein stabilized LRP6 with a prolonged half-life and induces LRP6 accumulation both at the cell surface and in endosomes. We also demonstrated that Kremen2 co-expression abrogated the effect of Dkk1 on LRP6 accumulation, indicating that the effect of Kremen2 is dominant over Dkk1 regulation of LRP6. Furthermore, we found that Wnt3A treatment induces LRP6 down-regulation, an effect paralleled with a Wnt/LRP6 signaling decay, and that Dkk1 treatment blocked Wnt3A-induced LRP6 down-regulation. Finally, we found that LRP6 turnover was blocked by an inhibitor of caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Conclusions/Significance Our results reveal a novel role for Dkk1 in preventing Wnt ligand-induced LRP6 down-regulation and contribute significantly to our understanding of Dkk1 function in Wnt/LRP6 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W1972107338,"The filamentous cyanobacterium Microcoleus vaginatus, a major primary producer in desert biological sand crusts, is exposed to frequent hydration (by early morning dew) followed by desiccation during potentially damaging excess light conditions. Nevertheless, its photosynthetic machinery is hardly affected by high light, unlike “model” organisms whereby light-induced oxidative stress leads to photoinactivation of the oxygen-evolving photosystem II (PSII). Field experiments showed a dramatic decline in the fluorescence yield with rising light intensity in both drying and artificially maintained wet plots. Laboratory experiments showed that, contrary to “model” organisms, photosynthesis persists in Microcoleus sp. even at light intensities 2–3 times higher than required to saturate oxygen evolution. This is despite an extensive loss (85–90%) of variable fluorescence and thermoluminescence, representing radiative PSII charge recombination that promotes the generation of damaging singlet oxygen. Light induced loss of variable fluorescence is not inhibited by the electron transfer inhibitors 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU), 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropylbenzoquinone (DBMIB), nor the uncoupler carbonyl cyanide-p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP), thus indicating that reduction of plastoquinone or O2, or lumen acidification essential for non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) are not involved. The rate of QA− re-oxidation in the presence of DCMU is enhanced with time and intensity of illumination. The difference in temperatures required for maximal thermoluminescence emissions from S2/QA− (Q band, 22°C) and S2,3/QB− (B band, 25°C) charge recombinations is considerably smaller in Microcoleus as compared to “model” photosynthetic organisms, thus indicating a significant alteration of the S2/QA− redox potential. We propose that enhancement of non-radiative charge recombination with rising light intensity may reduce harmful radiative recombination events thereby lowering 1O2 generation and oxidative photodamage under excess illumination. This effective photo-protective mechanism was apparently lost during the evolution from the ancestor cyanobacteria to the higher plant chloroplast."
https://openalex.org/W2044860127,"The innate immune system provides an initial line of defense against infection. Nucleotide-binding domain- and leucine-rich repeat-containing protein (NLR or (NOD-like)) receptors play a critical role in the innate immune response by surveying the cytoplasm for traces of intracellular invaders and endogenous stress signals. NLRs themselves are multi-domain proteins. Their N-terminal effector domains (typically a pyrin or caspase activation and recruitment domain) are responsible for driving downstream signaling and initiating the formation of inflammasomes, multi-component complexes necessary for cytokine activation. However, the currently available structures of NLR effector domains have not yet revealed the mechanism of their differential modes of interaction. Here, we report the structure and dynamics of the N-terminal pyrin domain of NLRP7 (NLRP7 PYD) obtained by NMR spectroscopy. The NLRP7 PYD adopts a six-alpha-helix bundle death domain fold. A comparison of conformational and dynamics features of the NLRP7 PYD with other PYDs showed distinct differences for helix alpha3 and loop alpha2-alpha3, which, in NLRP7, is stabilized by a strong hydrophobic cluster. Moreover, the NLRP7 and NLRP1 PYDs have different electrostatic surfaces. This is significant, because death domain signaling is driven by electrostatic contacts and stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. Thus, these results provide new insights into NLRP signaling and provide a first molecular understanding of inflammasome formation."
https://openalex.org/W2034616962,"We previously demonstrated that RhoA-dependent signaling regulates transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1)-induced cytoskeletal reorganization in the human retinal pigment epithelial cell line ARPE-19. Smad pathways have also been shown to mediate TGF-beta1 activity. Here, we examined what regulates Rho GTPase activity and tested whether Smad signaling cross-talks with Rho pathways during TGF-beta1-induced actin rearrangement. Using small interfering RNAs, we found that NET1, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor of RhoA, is critical for TGF-beta1-induced cytoskeletal reorganization, N-cadherin expression, and RhoA activation. In ARPE-19 cells lacking NET1, TGF-beta1-induced stress fibers and N-cadherin expression were not observed. Interestingly, in dominant-negative Smad3-expressing or constitutively active Smad7 cells, TGF-beta1 failed to induce NET1 mRNA and protein expression. Consistent with these results, both dominant-negative Smad3 and constitutively active Smad7 blocked the cytoplasmic localization of NET1 and inhibited interactions between NET1 and RhoA. Finally, we found that NET1 is a direct gene target of TGF-beta1 via Smad3. Taken together, our results demonstrate that Smad3 regulates RhoA activation and cytoskeletal reorganization by controlling NET1 in TGF-beta1-induced ARPE-19 cells. These data define a new role for Smad3 as a modulator of RhoA activation in the regulation of TGF-beta1-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transitions."
https://openalex.org/W2053600371,"The inflammatory milieu in the respiratory tract in cystic fibrosis (CF) has been linked to the defective expression of the cystic transmembrane regulator (CFTR) in epithelial cells. Alveolar macrophages (AM), important contibutors to inflammatory responses in the lung, also express CFTR. The present study analyzes the phenotype of human AM with silenced CFTR. Expression of CFTR mRNA and the immature form of the CFTR protein decreased 100-fold and 5.2-fold, respectively, in AM transfected with a CFTR specific siRNA (CFTR-siRNA) compared to controls. Reduction of CFTR expression in AM resulted in increased secretion of IL-8, increased phosphorylation of NF-kappaB, a positive regulator of IL-8 expression, and decreased expression of IkappaB-alpha, the inhibitory protein of NF-kappaB activation. AM with silenced CFTR expression also showed increased apoptosis. We hypothesized that caveolin-1 (Cav1), a membrane protein that is co-localized with CFTR in lipid rafts and that is related to inflammation and apoptosis in macrophages, may be affected by decreased CFTR expression. Messenger RNA and protein levels of Cav1 were increased in AM with silenced CFTR. Expression and transcriptional activity of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP), a negative transcriptional regulator of Cav1, was decreased in AM with silenced CFTR, but total and free cholesterol mass did not change. These findings indicate that silencing of CFTR in human AM results in an inflammatory phenotype and apoptosis, which is associated to SREBP-mediated regulation of Cav1."
https://openalex.org/W2077996870,"The importance of growth factors has been recognized for over five decades; however their utilization in medicine has yet to be fully realized. This is because free growth factors have short half-lives in plasma, making direct injection inefficient. Many growth factors are anchored and protected by sulfated glycosaminoglycans in the body. We set out to explore the use of heparin, a well-characterized sulfated glycosaminoglycan, for the controlled release of fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2). Heparin binds a multitude of growth factors and maintains their bioactivity for an extended period of time. We used a biocompatible polycation to precipitate out the [heparin∶FGF-2] complex from neutral buffer to form a release matrix. We can control the release rate of FGF-2 from the resultant matrix by altering the molecular weight of the polycation. The FGF-2 released from the delivery complex maintained its bioactivity and initiated cellular responses that were at least as potent as fresh bolus FGF-2 and fresh heparin stabilized FGF-2. This new delivery platform is not limited to FGF-2 but applicable to the large family of heparin-binding growth factors."
https://openalex.org/W2081429963,"Most of the signaling effectors located downstream of receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK) activation are calcium-sensitive.

Stimulating these cells with receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) induced a rapid and significant increase in [Ca2+]i. Adding extracellular Ca2+ chelators, depleting intracellular stores, and the use of a phospholipase C inhibitor all indicated that the Ca2+ was of extracellular origin, suggesting the involvement of a Ca2+ channel. We showed that none of the classical Ca2+ channels (L-, T-, or R-type) were involved in the RANKL-induced Ca2+ spike. However, the effect of high doses of Gd3+ did suggest that TRP family channels were present in human osteoclasts. The TRPV-5 channel was expressed in osteoclasts and was mainly located in the cellular area in contact with the bone surface. Furthermore, the RNA inactivation of TRPV-5 channel completely inhibited the RANKL-induced increase in [Ca2+]i, which was accompanied in the long term by marked activation of bone resorption.

https://openalex.org/W2164287726,"Infected-cell protein 0 (ICP0) is a RING finger E3 ligase that regulates herpes simplex virus (HSV) mRNA synthesis, and strongly influences the balance between latency and replication of HSV. For 25 years, the nuclear functions of ICP0 have been the subject of intense scrutiny. To obtain new clues about ICP0's mechanism of action, we constructed HSV-1 viruses that expressed GFP-tagged ICP0. To our surprise, both GFP-tagged and wild-type ICP0 were predominantly observed in the cytoplasm of HSV-infected cells. Although ICP0 is exclusively nuclear during the immediate-early phase of HSV infection, further analysis revealed that ICP0 translocated to the cytoplasm during the early phase where it triggered a previously unrecognized process; ICP0 dismantled the microtubule network of the host cell. A RING finger mutant of ICP0 efficiently bundled microtubules, but failed to disperse microtubule bundles. Synthesis of ICP0 proved to be necessary and sufficient to disrupt microtubule networks in HSV-infected and transfected cells. Plant and animal viruses encode many proteins that reorganize microtubules. However, this is the first report of a viral E3 ligase that regulates microtubule stability. Intriguingly, several cellular E3 ligases orchestrate microtubule disassembly and reassembly during mitosis. Our results suggest that ICP0 serves a dual role in the HSV life cycle, acting first as a nuclear regulator of viral mRNA synthesis and acting later, in the cytoplasm, to dismantle the host cell's microtubule network in preparation for virion synthesis and/or egress."
https://openalex.org/W1971364291,"Manipulation of the immune system represents a promising avenue for cancer therapy. Rational advances in immunotherapy of cancer will require an understanding of the precise correlates of protection. Agonistic antibodies against the tumor necrosis factor receptor family member 4-1BB are emerging as a promising tool in cancer therapy, with evidence that these antibodies expand both T cells as well as innate immune cells. Depletion studies have suggested that several cell types can play a role in these immunotherapeutic regimens, but do not reveal which cells must directly receive the 4-1BB signals for effective therapy.We show that re-activated memory T cells are superior to resting memory T cells in control of an 8-day pre-established E.G7 tumor in mice. We find that ex vivo activation of the memory T cells allows the activated effectors to continue to divide and enter the tumor, regardless of antigen-specificity; however, only antigen-specific reactivated memory T cells show any efficacy in tumor control. When agonistic anti-4-1BB antibody is combined with this optimized adoptive T cell therapy, 80% of mice survive and are fully protected from tumor rechallenge. Using 4-1BB-deficient mice and mixed bone marrow chimeras, we find that it is sufficient to have 4-1BB only on the endogenous host alphabeta T cells or only on the transferred T cells for the effects of anti-4-1BB to be realized. Conversely, although multiple immune cell types express 4-1BB and both T cells and APC expand during anti-4-1BB therapy, 4-1BB on cells other than alphabeta T cells is neither necessary nor sufficient for the effect of anti-4-1BB in this adoptive immunotherapy model.This study establishes alphabeta T cells rather than innate immune cells as the critical target in anti-4-1BB therapy of a pre-established tumor. The study also demonstrates that ex vivo activation of memory T cells prior to infusion allows antigen-specific tumor control without the need for reactivation of the memory T cells in the tumor."
https://openalex.org/W1972373125,"Background Ca2+ is essential for vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane in virtually all types of regulated exocytoses. However, in contrast to the well-known effects of a high cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) in the prefusion phase, the occurrence and significance of Ca2+ signals in the postfusion phase have not been described before. Methodology/Principal Findings We studied isolated rat alveolar type II cells using previously developed imaging techniques. These cells release pulmonary surfactant, a complex of lipids and proteins, from secretory vesicles (lamellar bodies) in an exceptionally slow, Ca2+- and actin-dependent process. Measurements of fusion pore formation by darkfield scattered light intensity decrease or FM 1-43 fluorescence intensity increase were combined with analysis of [Ca2+]c by ratiometric Fura-2 or Fluo-4 fluorescence measurements. We found that the majority of single lamellar body fusion events were followed by a transient (t1/2 of decay = 3.2 s) rise of localized [Ca2+]c originating at the site of lamellar body fusion. [Ca2+]c increase followed with a delay of ∼0.2–0.5 s (method-dependent) and in the majority of cases this signal propagated throughout the cell (at ∼10 µm/s). Removal of Ca2+ from, or addition of Ni2+ to the extracellular solution, strongly inhibited these [Ca2+]c transients, whereas Ca2+ store depletion with thapsigargin had no effect. Actin-GFP fluorescence around fused LBs increased several seconds after the rise of [Ca2+]c. Both effects were reduced by the non-specific Ca2+ channel blocker SKF96365. Conclusions/Significance Fusion-activated Ca2+ entry (FACE) is a new mechanism that leads to [Ca2+]c transients at the site of vesicle fusion. Substantial evidence from this and previous studies indicates that fusion-activated Ca2+ entry enhances localized surfactant release from type II cells, but it may also play a role for compensatory endocytosis and other cellular functions."
https://openalex.org/W1967254985,"It has been of interest whether and when the rearrangement of neuronal circuits can be induced after projection patterns are formed during development. Earlier studies using cats reported that the rearrangement of retinogeniculate projections could be induced even after eye-specific segregation has occurred, but detailed and quantitative characterization of this rearrangement has been lacking. Here we delineate the structural changes of retinogeniculate projections in the C57BL/6 mouse in response to monocular enucleation (ME) after eye-specific segregation. When ME was performed after eye-specific segregation, rearrangement of retinogeniculate axons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) was observed within 5 days. Although this rearrangement was observed both along the dorsomedial-ventrolateral and outer-inner axes in the dLGN, it occurred more rapidly along the outer-inner axis. We also examined the critical period for this rearrangement and found that the rearrangement became almost absent by the beginning of the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity in the primary visual cortex. Taken together, our findings serve as a framework for the assessment of phenotypes of genetically altered mouse strains as well as provide insights into the mechanisms underlying the rearrangement of retinogeniculate projections."

Due to the nature of the raw data produced by these technologies, a full genomic sequence attained without the aid of Sanger sequencing has yet to be demonstrated.We have successfully developed a four-phase strategy for using only next-generation sequencing technologies (Illumina and 454) to assemble a complete microbial genome de novo. We applied this approach to completely assemble the 3.7 Mb genome of a rare Geobacter variant (KN400) that is capable of unprecedented current production at an electrode. Two key components of our strategy enabled us to achieve this result. First, we integrated the two data types early in the process to maximally leverage their complementary characteristics. And second, we used the output of different short read assembly programs in such a way so as to leverage the complementary nature of their different underlying algorithms or of their different implementations of the same underlying algorithm.The significance of our result is that it demonstrates a general approach for maximizing the efficiency and success of genome assembly projects as new sequencing technologies and new assembly algorithms are introduced. The general approach is a meta strategy, wherein sequencing data are integrated as early as possible and in particular ways and wherein multiple assembly algorithms are judiciously applied such that the deficiencies in one are complemented by another."

Fully (four-electron) reduced NOR is capable of two turnovers with NO. Initial binding of NO to reduced heme b3 occurs with a time constant of ∼1 μs at 1.5 mm NO, in agreement with earlier studies. This reaction is [NO]-dependent, ruling out an obligatory binding of NO to FeB before ligation to heme b3. Oxidation of hemes b and c occurs in a biphasic reaction with rate constants of 50 s−1 and 3 s−1 at 1.5 mm NO and pH 7.5. Interestingly, this oxidation is accelerated as [NO] is lowered; the rate constants are 120 s−1 and 12 s−1 at 75 μm NO. Protons are taken up from solution concomitantly with oxidation of the low spin hemes, leading to an acceleration at low pH. This effect is, however, counteracted by a larger degree of substrate inhibition at low pH.

Bacterial nitric-oxide reductases (NOR) 3The abbreviations used are: NORnitric-oxide reductaseDDMβ-d-dodecyl maltosideHCuOheme-copper oxidaseMes4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. are integral membrane proteins that reduce NO to N2O (Reaction 1) as part of the sequential reduction of nitrate to dinitrogen, a process termed denitrification (for recent reviews, see Refs. 1Zumft W.G.

The largest subunit in the NORs is a divergent member of the superfamily of O2-reducing heme-copper oxidases (HCuOs), which are characterized by having a catalytic subunit with six invariant histidines at the same predicted positions in 12 trans-membrane helices (3Saraste M. Castresana J. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 4van der Oost J. de Boer A.P. de Gier J.W. Zumft W.G. Stouthamer A.H. van Spanning R.J. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1994; 121: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Two of these histidines coordinate a low spin heme, one a high spin heme, and in the O2-reducing heme-copper oxidases, the remaining three histidines coordinate a copper ion. In NOR, this copper is presumed to be replaced by a non-heme iron (5Hendriks J. Warne A. Gohlke U. Haltia T. Ludovici C. Lübben M. Saraste M.

When purified, the NOR from Paracoccus denitrificans contains two subunits; NorB and NorC. NorB is the catalytic subunit harboring a low spin heme b, a high spin heme b3, and a non-heme iron, FeB. The heme b3 and FeB form a magnetically coupled binuclear center, which is the site of NO reduction. This binuclear center is connected via a μ-oxo bridge in the resting oxidized state of the enzyme (7Field S.J. Prior L. Roldan M.D. Cheesman M.R. Thomson A.J. Spiro S. Butt J.N. Watmough N.J.

NorC is a membrane-anchored protein harboring a low spin heme c, which is believed to be the site of electron entry from the water-soluble electron source, either cytochrome c551 or pseudoazurin (1Zumft W.G.

Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial aa3-type HCuOs, like bovine cytochrome c oxidase, are not capable of NO reduction at significant turnover rates (11Giuffrè A. Stubauer G. Sarti P. Brunori M. Zumft W.G. Buse G.

Commun. 1998; 245: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Some properties of NOR that differ from other HCuOs and thus might be involved in conferring the high NO-reducing capability include: (i) the iron instead of copper in the catalytic site and the binding characteristics of ligands such as CO (13Hendriks J.H. Prior L. Baker A.R. Thomson A.J. Saraste M. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13361-13369Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar); (ii) a very low midpoint potential (∼60 mV) of high spin heme b3, suggested to avoid formation of a stable heme b32+-NO “dead-end” complex during turnover (14Grönberg K.L.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13780-13786Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar); (iii) a reaction decoupled from the generation of an electrochemical gradient, NO reduction by NOR is nonelectrogenic and protons as well as electrons are derived from the periplasmic side of the membrane (15Bell L.C.

The detailed mechanism for NO reduction by NOR is not known, but models have been suggested that involve either a “trans” mechanism (16Hendriks J.H. Jasaitis A. Saraste M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2331-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 18Moënne-Loccoz P. deVries S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5147-5152Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 19Kumita H.

Blomberg M.R. Siegbahn P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 240-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A detailed catalytic model needs to be compatible with the observation that the maximum turnover activity is obtained at ∼5 μm NO, whereas higher NO concentrations lead to a decrease in activity. This substrate inhibition has been suggested to be due to NO binding also to oxidized NOR (6Girsch P. de Vries S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 202-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 22Pinakoulaki E. Gemeinhardt S. Saraste M. Varotsis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23407-23413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). For the HCuOs, the detailed mechanism of oxygen reduction and its coupled proton pumping have been investigated extensively using the so-called “flow-flash” technique (23Gibson Q.H. Greenwood C. Biochem. J. 1963; 86: 541-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In this technique, fully reduced enzyme with the inhibitor carbon monoxide (CO) bound to the high spin heme in the active site is mixed in a stopped-flow apparatus with an O2-containing solution. Because O2 cannot bind to the high spin heme while CO is bound, the reaction is limited by dissociation of CO, which is slow. However, if a short laser flash (∼10 ns) is applied when mixing is complete, the photolabile Fe-CO bond is broken, and the binding of dioxygen and its subsequent stepwise reduction can be followed using time-resolved spectroscopy. This technique has been used in combination with different detection techniques and has led to insights into the catalytic cycle of the HCuOs, e.g. the conversion rates and chemical structure of different intermediates, the sequence of electron transfer reactions, and the mechanisms and pathways for proton transfer (see e.g. 24Proshlyakov D.A.

Acta. 1997; 1318: 6-10Crossref Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Using the flow-flash technique, we have previously studied the reaction between fully reduced NOR and O2 rather than NO because of the experimental advantages, e.g. in studying the mechanism of proton transfer (27Flock U. Watmough N.J. Ädelroth P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10711-10719Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 28Flock U. Thorndycroft F.H. Matorin A.D. Richardson D.J. Watmough N.J. Ädelroth P. J. Biol.

Biochem. 2009; 103: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), because the chemical reactivity of NO in aqueous solutions hampers direct pH measurements. Our results showed oxygen binding to heme b3 followed by electron transfer from the low spin hemes b and c to the bound O2 with a time constant of 25 ms (at pH 7.5). The 25-ms phase is coupled to proton uptake from the bulk solution, limited by proton transfer from a group with pKa = 6.6 (27Flock U. Watmough N.J. Ädelroth P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10711-10719Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This reaction was impaired or specifically altered in mutant NORs where residues, suggested (17Reimann J. Flock U. Lepp H. Honigmann A. Ädelroth P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1767: 362-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) to form a proton transfer pathway leading from the periplasm to the active site, were exchanged by site-directed mutagenesis (28Flock U.

Reimann J. Watmough N.J. Ädelroth P. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2009; 103: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The flow-flash technique has also been used in one study of reduction of NO by NOR (16Hendriks J.H. Jasaitis A. Saraste M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2331-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The reductive coupling of two NO molecules to form N2O requires two electrons, whereas the fully reduced NOR has four redox-active groups. Hence, two full turnovers are required to reoxidize the enzyme. Moreover, because the oxidized NOR can bind NO (see above and Ref 22Pinakoulaki E. Gemeinhardt S. Saraste M. Varotsis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23407-23413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), there are multiple possible reaction paths in the reaction of fully reduced NOR with NO. To elucidate the details of the mechanism of reduction of the physiological substrate NO, here we have studied the reaction between fully reduced NOR and NO, with special emphasis on the effect of the concentration of the substrates NO and protons. Our results show that whereas initial binding of NO to the heme b3 shows an acceleration at higher [NO], subsequent oxidation of the low spin hemes is decelerated. These results indicate that NO does not necessarily have to bind transiently to FeB for producing the first N2O at the active site. Furthermore, NO binds to an inhibitory site, possibly the oxidized heme b3 (or FeB), faster than electrons are transferred to the active site for the second turnover. This slows oxidation already during a single oxidative cycle. We also studied proton uptake from solution, which occurred simultaneously with oxidation of the low spin hemes. This is consistent with the effect of lowering the pH on these reactions, where binding of NO to heme b3 is not dependent on pH, whereas subsequent oxidation of the low spin hemes is. The results further show that at low pH, this increase in rate is counteracted by a more pronounced substrate inhibition, possibly associated with a larger degree of NO binding to the oxidized b3 (or FeB) at low pH. The NOR used in this study was from P. denitrificans, expressed in Escherichia coli JM109 using the expression system described in Ref. 10Butland G. Spiro S. Watmough N.J. Richardson D.J. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar. Growth of bacteria, preparation of membranes, and purification of NOR were performed as previously described (10Butland G. Spiro S. Watmough N.J. Richardson D.J. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), with the same changes as in (28Flock U. Thorndycroft F.H. Matorin A.D. Richardson D.J. Watmough N.J. Ädelroth P. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 3839-3845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). NOR was then rapidly frozen in N2(l) and stored at −80 °C until needed. NOR was diluted to 5–10 μm in a modified Thunberg cuvette, air was exchanged for nitrogen on a vacuum line, and the enzyme was reduced by adding 1–2 mm ascorbate and 0.2 μm 5-methylphenazinium methosulfate. Nitrogen was then exchanged for ∼15% CO as in Ref. 27Flock U. Watmough N.J. Ädelroth P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10711-10719Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar; low CO concentrations were used to avoid CO recombination interfering with NO binding. Before transferring the sample to the flow-flash apparatus, 10–20 μm dithionite was added to ensure that the sample was completely reduced and to reduce any residual O2. The setup for flow-flash measurements was described in Ref. 30Brändén M. Sigurdson H. Namslauer A. Gennis R.B. Ädelroth P. Brzezinski P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2001; 98: 5013-5018Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar. Briefly, fully reduced CO-bound NOR was mixed 1:5 with NO-containing buffers in a modified stopped-flow apparatus (Applied Photophysics), where both syringes had been made anaerobic by incubation in 50 mm dithionite overnight. After a 200-ms delay, a 10-ns laser flash from the second harmonic (532 nm) of a Nd-YAG laser (Quantel) was applied, dissociating CO and allowing NO to bind and initiate the reaction. For measurements of NO binding at high (millimolar) NO concentrations, the rise time of the instrument was improved, and the xenon lamp of the measuring light was pulsed, generating a bright light pulse, stable for ∼500 μs, as described in Ref. 31Namslauer A. Brändén M. Brzezinski P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 10369-10374Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar. The time course of the reaction was studied at different wavelengths in the Soret and α regions. Typically, at each wavelength, 5 · 104 data points were collected, and the dataset was then reduced to ∼1000 points by averaging on a logarithmic time scale. For the pH-dependence measurements, the buffer concentration in the NOR solution before mixing (in the same 1:5 ratio) was decreased to 10 mm (Hepes at pH 7.5). The NO buffer contained either 200 mm Mes (pH 6.0–7.0) or 200 mm Hepes (pH 7.0–8.0). Buffers with saturated [NO] were prepared by flushing 100% NO gas through anaerobic buffers as in Ref. 5Hendriks J. Warne A. Gohlke U. Haltia T. Ludovici C. Lübben M. Saraste M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13102-13109Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar. The lower [NO] buffers were prepared by flushing 5% NO gas (mixed with 95% N2) in the same way. The solubility of NO was taken to be 1.8 mm at all pH values (32Armor J.N. J. Chem. Eng. Data. 1974; 19: 82-84Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar), so that after mixing NOR with NO in the flow-flash setup in the 1:5 ratio, the [NO] was ∼1.5 mm (from 100% NO) or 75 μm (from 5% NO). Preliminary experiments varying the final NO concentrations were made by varying the mixing ratio in the flow-flash setup. Proton uptake during oxidation of fully reduced NOR by NO was measured essentially as in Ref. 33Huang Y. Reimann J. Lepp H. Drici N. Ädelroth P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 20257-20262Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar. Briefly, the protein sample was concentrated and passed through a PD-10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 100 mm KCl, 50 μm EDTA, and 0.05% DDM. Phenol red was added to 40 μm and the pH adjusted to ∼7.6. The protein sample was then reduced and CO-bound as described before. The NO solution also contained 100 mm KCl, 50 μm EDTA, 0.05% DDM, and 40 μm phenol red at pH ∼7.6. The measurements were performed at 567 nm (rather than at the absorbance maximum of the dye at 560 nm) to minimize contributions from oxidation of the low spin heme b. To minimize pH drifts in the unbuffered solutions, due to NO reacting with any residual O2 (producing HNO3), the glucose/glucose oxidase/catalase system (30 mm glucose, 0.1 unit/ml glucose oxidase, and 20 units/ml catalase) was included in both the protein sample and the unbuffered NO mixing solution. Furthermore, only the lower (75 μm) NO concentration was used. The pH of the solution was monitored by the absorbance of phenol red at 570 nm and adjusted immediately before transferring it to the mixing syringes. The buffer control solution contained 50 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 50 mm KCl, 50 μm EDTA, 0.05% DDM, and 40 μm phenol red. As a further comparison, O2 was instead used as the oxidant in the same experiment (as in Ref. 27Flock U. Watmough N.J. Ädelroth P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10711-10719Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) to compare the amplitudes of the observed proton uptake signals. To extract the rate constants and kinetic difference spectra from the traces obtained in the flow-flash experiment, the time-resolved changes in absorbance from different wavelengths were fitted either separately or globally to a model of consecutive irreversible reactions using the software package Pro-K (Applied Photophysics). Alternatively, rate constants were fitted as a sum of exponentials in SigmaPlot (Jandel Scientific). After mixing of CO-bound fully reduced NOR with NO-containing buffers, CO is flashed off from heme b3 allowing NO to bind and initiate the reaction. The static optical spectra of oxidized, reduced, and CO-bound NOR are shown in supplemental Fig. 1. Fully reduced NOR has four preloaded electrons, whereas reduction of NO to N2O requires two. Therefore, we will assume that the reaction comprises two turnovers, where the first uses electrons already present at the binuclear site, whereas the second turnover has to involve electron transfer from the low spin hemes b and c. After the unresolved flash-induced dissociation of CO from heme b3, the first observed phase in the presence of 1.5 mm NO has a time constant of ∼1 μs and is clearly seen as an absorbance decrease at 430 nm (Fig. 1A). This phase shows a kinetic difference spectrum (data not shown) consistent with NO binding to the heme b3, similar to the spectrum obtained by Hendriks et al. (16Hendriks J.H. Jasaitis A. Saraste M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2331-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). There is a second rapid phase with a time constant of ∼20 μs and a different kinetic difference spectrum with small amplitudes, that we cannot assign to a specific process at this point. The rate constant and spectrum of this phase are similar to the 1.9·104 s−1 (τ = 50 μs) phase obtained by Hendriks et al. (16Hendriks J.H. Jasaitis A. Saraste M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2331-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, the amplitude of this phase varies at 430 nm between protein preparations, which we assume is due to an overlapping second phase of NO binding, similar to the biphasic CO binding which is more pronounced in the P. denitrificans NOR when expressed in E. coli (see 13Hendriks J.H. Prior L. Baker A.R. Thomson A.J. Saraste M. Watmough N.J. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 13361-13369Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar and 27Flock U. Watmough N.J. Ädelroth P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10711-10719Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). After binding of NO during the first 100 μs, there are no significant absorbance changes until oxidation of the low spin hemes takes place on the millisecond time scale (see below and Fig. 1). At 1.5 mm NO and pH 7.5, oxidation of the low spin hemes occurs with rate constants of 50 s−1 and 3 s−1 (τ = 20 ms and 300 ms, respectively; see fits in Fig. 1). As seen in Fig. 1, the c-type heme has a larger contribution to the fast phase (about 50% of absorbance change at 550 nm) than the b-type hemes (6–20% contribution at the other wavelengths). Heme c thus oxidizes faster than heme b, which is consistent with previously obtained data (16Hendriks J.H. Jasaitis A. Saraste M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2331-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The rapid phase(s) of NO-binding clearly displays NO concentration-dependent kinetics. At 75 μm NO (Fig. 2), the trace on the rapid time scale was fitted with two time constants of 6 μs and 100 μs, each contributing ∼50% to the observed amplitude. This gives a difference of a factor of ∼5 to the rates for binding at 1.5 mm NO (for both components). Oxidation of the low spin hemes is also clearly dependent on the NO concentration, as the process speeds up at lower [NO] (see Fig. 2). A global fit to data at 420, 430, and 550 nm (data at 420 and 550 nm not shown) for 75 μm NO shown in Fig. 2 gave major rate constants of 120 s−1 and 12 s−1. Also, at this [NO], the fast process is mainly heme c oxidation (60% contribution at 550 nm, below 35% at 420 and 430). This gives a difference of a factor of ∼3–4 compared with the rates observed at 1.5 mm NO (50 s−1 and 3 s−1). Whereas rapid binding of NO on the microsecond time scale at 1.5 mm is not dependent on pH (Fig. 3A), oxidation of the low spin hemes is, as seen in Fig. 3. The slower heme oxidation phase at pH 6.0 with 1.5 mm NO had a rate constant of ∼6 s−1 (Fig. 3A), a factor of 2 faster than at pH 7.5. The pH effect is more pronounced at lower [NO] (75 μm) (Fig. 3B), where the slower (major) rate constants differ by a factor of 8 (∼100 s−1 at pH 6.0 compared with 12 s−1 at pH 7.5). The same data also show that the effect of lowering the [NO] on the kinetics is greater at pH 6.0, the rate of the major (slower) heme oxidation phase increases from ∼6 s−1 (1.5 mm) to ∼100 s−1 (75 μm), a factor of 17, which is linear with the 20-fold decrease in [NO]. Table 1 summarizes the kinetic data for oxidation of the low spin hemes.TABLE 1Rate constants observed for the oxidation of the low spin hemes during oxidation of fully reduced NOR by NONO concentrationRate constants% of Total amplitude560 nm (heme b)550 nm (heme c)s−11.5 mm NO, pH 7.55010503905075 μm NO, pH 7.512010551290451.5 mm NO, pH 6.0150∼10aNot detected at 560 nm, amount of heme b oxidized estimated from other wavelengths.406∼90aNot detected at 560 nm, amount of heme b oxidized estimated from other wavelengths.6075 μm NO, pH 6.0∼50035601006540a Not detected at 560 nm, amount of heme b oxidized estimated from other wavelengths. Open table in a new tab Proton uptake by NOR during oxidation by 75 μm NO is shown in Fig. 4A. The traces obtained were fitted (globally, including also data at 420 and 550 nm) to two phases with rate constants ∼200 s−1 and 20 s−1 with approximately equal amplitudes (ΔA∼1.5·10−3 for each phase) at 567 nm. These rate constants are slightly faster than those obtained in the buffered solutions at pH 7.5 (see above), indicating that the pH has drifted to a somewhat lower pH. The trace acquired at 430 nm the same experiment is shown in Fig. 4B, and as seen in the figure, proton uptake does not occur on the time scale of NO binding, but only coupled to the slower phases of oxidation of the low spin hemes. For the control using O2 as the oxidant, the rate constants obtained correlated well with those obtained earlier (27Flock U. Watmough N.J. Ädelroth P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10711-10719Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) with a total amplitude of 5–6 milliabsorbance units. We assume that this difference in total amplitudes (∼3 milliabsorbance units when NO is the oxidant) is due to a higher buffering capacity with NO and that approximately ∼1H+/reacting NOR is taken up in both cases (see 27Flock U. Watmough N.J. Ädelroth P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10711-10719Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar and 33Huang Y. Reimann J. Lepp H. Drici N. Ädelroth P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 20257-20262Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar for a discussion on proton uptake amplitudes). In this work, we have studied the reaction between fully reduced bacterial NO reductase and NO time-resolved using the flow-flash technique. The fully reduced NOR contains four electrons available in the reaction with the substrate, whereas the conversion of NO to N2O is a two-electron reduction (see Reaction 1). Therefore the enzyme is capable of completing two full turnovers, involving the binding of four NO molecules. Two electrons reside in the binuclear site, so we expect the first turnover to use these electrons and involve no oxidation of the low spin hemes b and c. The second turnover, however, must involve transfer of electrons from the low spin hemes to the active site, as well as binding of two additional NOs. Initial binding of NO (at 1.5 mm) to reduced heme b3 occurs on the microsecond time scale (Fig. 1A), in agreement with previous measurements (16Hendriks J.H. Jasaitis A. Saraste M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2331-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). When [NO] is decreased to 75 μm, binding is clearly slowed (see Fig. 2), and preliminary data indicate that binding is slowed also when the NO concentration is decreased to intermediate [NO], around 0.5 mm (data not shown). Hendriks et al. (16Hendriks J.H. Jasaitis A. Saraste M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2331-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) suggested that the initial binding of NO to reduced heme b3 is independent of [NO], possibly because of limiting internal transfer from FeB to the heme b3, which is not in agreement with our data. However, at this stage we cannot rule out the possibility that the rate of binding saturates at [NO]<1.5 mm because the deceleration of NO binding is not linear with [NO] between 75 μm and 1.5 mm (the rate constant(s) is ∼6-fold slower for 20 times lower [NO]). Hence, internal transfer of NO from FeB to heme b3 might limit the rate at very high [NO]. It should be noted that we do not expect the binding of NO to FeB to give rise to any significant absorbance changes at the wavelengths used, so FeB might bind NO faster than the heme b3, or it could bind NO during the 200-ms mixing time, with CO still bound to the heme b3. Such simultaneous binding of CO to heme b3 and NO to FeB has been suggested previously (19Kumita H. Matsuura K. Hino T. Takahashi S. Hori H. Fukumori Y. Morishima I. Shiro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55247-55254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The second NO molecule could also bind to the intermediate formed at heme b3 upon binding of the first (21Blomberg L.M. Blomberg M.R. Siegbahn P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 240-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Our data do not allow discrimination between these scenarios. Further, we report here the first studies of how the oxidation of the low spin hemes in the reaction between NO and the fully reduced NOR depends on the concentration of NO. Interestingly, this process accelerates as [NO] is lowered. Bacterial NOR is known to show substrate inhibition on steady-state turnover (6Girsch P. de Vries S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 202-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), where the maximum activity occurs at a few micromolar NO. The molecular mechanism for this inhibition is not known, but it was suggested to be due to NO binding also to the oxidized NOR, with an obtained Ki of 13.5 μm at pH 6.0 (6Girsch P. de Vries S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 202-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). There are several possible mechanisms for how NO binding to the oxidized NOR could inhibit the catalytic rate; e.g. binding to ferric heme b3 lowering its midpoint potential, slowing the rate of electron transfer from the low spin hemes, conformational changes affecting the input of electrons into the protein, binding of NO to ferric FeB, affecting its electron donation rate, or binding to some other “allosteric” site. In the reaction between O2 and fully reduced NOR, the rate of oxidation of the low spin hemes is independent of [O2] (27Flock U. Watmough N.J. Ädelroth P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10711-10719Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), showing that regardless of where the inhibitory NO site is, it is specific for NO. There are several reports of NO binding to ferric heme b3 (see e.g. 22Pinakoulaki E. Gemeinhardt S. Saraste M. Varotsis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23407-23413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 34Sakurai T. Nakashima S. Kataoka K. Seo D. Sakurai N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), an interaction that was suggested to be pH-dependent, with more NO bound at lower pH values (34Sakurai T. Nakashima S. Kataoka K. Seo D. Sakurai N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The reason for the pH dependence has been suggested to be linked to the μ-oxo bridged structure between heme b3 and FeB in the resting oxidized NOR. This μ-oxo bridge is presumed to be easier to displace at low pH (35Moënne-Loccoz P. Nat. Prod. Rep. 2007; 24: 610-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The larger extent of NO binding to ferric NOR at lower pH is consistent with larger absorbance changes obtained when oxidized P. denitrificans NOR reacts with NO at pH 6.0 compared with 7.5. 4P. Lachmann, unpublished data. Also, ferric FeB has been suggested to bind NO (34Sakurai T. Nakashima S. Kataoka K. Seo D. Sakurai N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Catalysis by NOR was suggested by Blomberg et al. (21Blomberg L.M. Blomberg M.R. Siegbahn P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1757: 240-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) to involve binding of NO to ferrous heme b3 followed by the second NO molecule binding to b32+-NO, forming a hyponitrous acid coordinating between heme b3 and FeB. In this scenario, binding of NO to FeB is a site of inhibition, as it would interfere with catalytic binding. We also note that there are no major absorbance changes occurring between those attributed to the binding of NO and later phases due to oxidation of the low spin hemes (see below). We therefore (in agreement with Hendriks et al. (16Hendriks J.H. Jasaitis A. Saraste M. Verkhovsky M.I. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2331-2340Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar)) see no evidence for the suggested displacement of the proximal His ligand to heme b3 upon NO binding (18Moënne-Loccoz P. deVries S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5147-5152Crossref Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We presume that there are several processes occurring during this time; the binuclear center should oxidize, producing the first molecule of N2O, and NO should bind to its inhibitory site affecting the rate of electron transfer from the low spin hemes (see below). None of these processes is thus associated with large absorbance changes (at the wavelengths used), which is in agreement with the relatively small absorbance changes seen for NO binding to the resting oxidized NOR at pH 7.5 (22Pinakoulaki E. Gemeinhardt S. Saraste M. Varotsis C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23407-23413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar,34Sakurai T. Nakashima S. Kataoka K. Seo D. Sakurai N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 483-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).4 Also, we see no uptake of protons on the time scale of the first NO turnover (Fig. 4), so the protons needed for producing the first N2O (and H2O) must be taken internally from the protein, possibly from the Glu-198 or Glu-267 close to the binuclear site (see e.g. 29Flock U. Lachmann P. Reimann J. Watmough N.J. Ädelroth P. J. Inorg. Biochem. 2009; 103: 845-850Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Here, we have shown that substrate inhibition occurs already when the fully reduced NOR reacts with NO, ruling out that the inhibition involves electron input into the protein, which does not occur in our experiments. Our work also shows that binding of NO to its inhibitory site must occur on the time scale of oxidation of the low spin hemes in our measurements, i.e. on the millisecond time scale or faster. This is because after the first presumed turnover, using electrons from the binuclear site, NO must bind to its inhibitory site (at the oxidized binuclear center) before electrons redistribute from the low spin hemes. If otherwise, the second turnover would be a repetition of the first, showing acceleration instead of deceleration at high [NO]. This means that reaction schemes involving such electron redistribution before NO binding (such as in Ref. 19Kumita H. Matsuura K. Hino T. Takahashi S. Hori H. Fukumori Y. Morishima I. Shiro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 55247-55254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) are incompatible with our data. A simplified reaction scheme consistent with the data obtained in this study is shown in Fig. 5. It should be noted that in the resting state of oxidized NOR, the μ-oxo bridge needs to be broken for NO to bind. In our kinetic measurements, however, it is possible that after the first turnover, NO binds to the oxidized NOR before the μ-oxo bridge is reformed (see Fig. 5 and its legend), hampering a direct correlation to data obtained with the resting enzyme. Whether or not the μ-oxo bridge forms during steady-state turnover is not known. We also report here the first measurements of proton uptake from solution coupled to oxidation of NOR by NO, which showed that transfer of electrons from the low spin hemes into the active site is coupled to proton uptake, whereas initial binding of NO is not (Fig. 4). This is consistent with the finding that oxidation of hemes b and c is pH-dependent, whereas binding of NO to reduced heme b3 (at 1.5 mm) is not (Fig. 3). It should be noted that the kinetic effect of lowering the pH presumably is underestimated because more NO seems to bind to the oxidized NOR at lower pH (see above). Thereby, the slowing of oxidation due to NO bound to oxidized NOR could be larger at low pH, counteracting the acceleration of electron transfer due to the coupled proton uptake in the oxidation process. This is also supported by our observation that the effect of lowering [NO] on the rates of oxidation is larger at pH 6 than at pH 7.5. Using the binding and inhibition parameters derived by Girsch and deVries from steady-state NO reduction at pH 6 (6Girsch P. de Vries S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1318: 202-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), the kcat at 1.5 mm NO compared with 75 μm should differ by a factor of 18. Interestingly, this is the same number as that obtained for the ratio (a factor of 17) of the rate constants in the oxidation of the fully reduced NOR at the same [NO] and pH (see Fig. 3 and Table 1). At pH 7.5, however, this ratio is only 3–4, presumably due to a smaller degree of NO binding to its inhibitory site. Electron transfer from the low spin hemes, coupled to the transfer of protons into the active site, is observed also upon oxidation of fully reduced NOR by O2 (27Flock U. Watmough N.J. Ädelroth P. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 10711-10719Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In that study, the rate of oxidation of the low spin hemes displayed pH-dependent kinetics with a pKa of 6.6. The time constants were in the same range (25 ms at pH 7.5) as those found in this work using NO as the electron acceptor (time constants 20 ms and 300 ms at 1.5 mm NO). Additionally, the rates were pH-dependent in the same range, indicating that proton transfer contributes to the rate-limiting step of the reactions. In summary, in this study we have presented results from studies of the interrelated pH- and [NO] dependence during oxidation of the fully reduced NOR by NO. Although NO binding to heme b3 accelerates with increasing NO concentration, the following oxidation of the low spin hemes, which is coupled to proton uptake from solution, decelerates. Substrate inhibition by NO in NOR has previously been observed during steady-state turnover, but here we have shown that it occurs already upon oxidation of fully reduced NOR. Binding to the inhibitory site must therefore occur before redistribution of electrons to the active site, offering mechanistic insights into how NO reduction is catalyzed by NOR.

Of utmost scientific interest is the study of physiological systems in which the splicing pattern changes in response to a stimulus such as a hormone or a nutrient. Recently, we identified a new splice variant of human PKCδ, PKCδVIII (GenBankTM Accession No. DQ516383). Sequencing and computational analysis of the PKCδVIII sequence indicated that this human splice variant is generated by utilization of an alternative downstream 5′ splice site of PKCδ pre-mRNA exon 10 (1Jiang K.

Further, we demonstrated that RA dramatically increased the expression of PKCδVIII via alternative splicing in NT2 cells. RA promotes hippocampal neurogenesis and spatial memory (25Bonnet E. Touyarot K. Alfos S. Pallet V. Higueret P. Abrous D.N. PLoS ONE. 2008; 3e3487Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). RA is an early signaling component of the central nervous system (CNS) and acts as a master switch of gene expression. It is well established that the vitamin A metabolite, RA, directly affects transcription of genes. Hence, we sought to elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing this novel observation of RA-mediated alternative splicing of PKCδ pre-mRNA resulting in the expression of the pro-survival protein PKCδVIII. The Ntera2 human teratocarcinoma cell line (NT2/D1 cells) is maintained in DMEM, 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) with fresh medium every 3 days. The cells are supplemented with 10 μm RA as indicated. cDNA from these cells were obtained from Dr. Sanchez-Ramos (James A. Haley Veterans Hospital, Tampa, FL), and the cells were cultured in his laboratory. Patients undergoing anterior temporal lobectomy provided written informed consent allowing the tissue to be used for research. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB 102342), University of South Florida. Hippocampal tissue was dissected from the temporal lobe resection, dissociated, and plated for generation of a stem/progenitor cells line using standard methods. Hippocampus biopsies were sterilely removed from a 31-year-old male and transferred to a 35-mm plate containing PBS plus 0.5% BSA. A sterile scalpel was used to finely chop the tissue into small pieces. 0.05% Trypsin/EDTA was added to cells and was incubated at 37 °C for 8–10 min. The pellet was suspended in DMEM/F12 plus 10% FBS, followed by DNase treatment. The final pellet was re-suspended in DMEM/F12, and a cell count for viability was performed. The cells were seeded into a T-75 flask in DMEM/F12 plus 2% FBS, EGF, and bFGF 20 ng/ml. Cells were replated on poly-l-ornithine-coated chamber slides. Digital images of the hippocampal neurons stained with nestin, TuJ1, BrdU, and NeuN were captured using Zeiss confocal microscope and characterized. The cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2, 95% humidity. As the numbers of proliferating cells reached confluency, aliquots of stem/progenitor cells were frozen for later use. Cells used in experiments described here were plated into 6-well plates. Cell lysates (40 μg) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with Tris-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20 containing 5% nonfat dried milk, washed, and incubated with a polyclonal antibody against either anti-SC35 (26Jiang K.

Following incubation with anti-rabbit IgG-HRP, enhanced chemiluminescence (PierceTM) was used for detection. cDNA (2 μl) was amplified by real-time quantitative PCR using Syber (SYBR) Green with an ABI PRISM 7900 sequence detection system (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) as described previously to quantify absolute levels of PKCδI and PKCδVIII mRNA in the samples (1Jiang K.

GAPDH was amplified as the endogenous control. Briefly, primers used were as follows: PKCδI sense primer: 5′-GCCAACCTCTGCGGCATCA-3′; antisense primer: 5′-CGTAGGTCCCACTGTTGTC↓TTGCATG-3′; PKCδVIII sense primer: 5′-GCCAACCTCTGCGGCATCA-3′; antisense primer: 5′-CGTAGGTCCCACTGTTGTC↓CTGTCTC-3′. These primers overlap the exon-exon boundary (indicated by the ↓) specific for each transcript. The primers for GAPDH were: sense primer 5′-CTTCATTGACCTCAACTACAT-3′ and antisense primer 5′-TGTCATGGATGACCTTGGCCA-3′. Real time PCR was then performed on samples and standards in triplicates. Absolute quantification of mRNA expression levels for PKCδI and PKCδVIII was calculated by normalizing the values to GAPDH. The results were analyzed with two-tailed Student's t test using PRISM4 statistical analysis software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). A level of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Significance is determined after three or more experiments. SC35 and SF2/ASF plasmids were obtained from Origene (TrueCloneTM cDNA plasmids). Plasmid DNA (1 to 2 μg) was transfected into cells using Trans-IT® or Lipofectamine® (Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions. Two siRNAs that target separate areas were used to knockdown expression of SC35. SC35 siRNAs along with its scrambled control were purchased from Ambion® (IDs: 12628 and 12444) and transfected using Ambion's siRNA transfection kit. These were validated for specificity to eliminate off-target gene effects. Ambion's PARIS kit (catalogue 1921) was used to simultaneously isolate proteins and RNA to verify knockdown by siRNA transfection. Total RNA was isolated from cells using using RNA-BeeTM (Tel Test, Inc) as per manufacturer's instructions. 2 μg of RNA was used to synthesize first strand cDNA using an Oligo(dT) primer and OmniscriptTM kit (Qiagen). PCR was performed using 2 μl of RT reaction and Takara Taq polymerase. The primers are listed: Human PKCδ sense primer 5′-CACTATATTCCAGAAAGAACGC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CCCTCCCAGATCTTGCC-3′; PKCδVIII-specific antisense primer 5′-CCCTCCCAGATCTTGCC-3′; SD-SA on pSPL3 sense primer 5′-TCTCAGTCACCTGGACAACC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-CCACACCAGCCACCACCTTCT-3′; SC35 sense primer 5′-TCCAAGTCCAAGTCCTCCTC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-ACTGCTCCCTCTTCTTCTGG-3′; GAPDH sense primer 5′-CTTCATTGACCTCAACTCATG-3′ and antisense primer 5′-TGTCATGGATGACCTTGGCCAG-3′. Using PKCδ primers, PKCδI and PKCδVIII are detected simultaneously: PKCδI is 368 bp and PKCδVIII is 461 bp. Using PKCδVIII-specific primers, PKCδVIII is 424 bp; SC35 is 210 bp; GAPDH is 391 bp; SD-SA: 263 bp; utilization of 5′ splice site I: 419 bp; utilization of 5′ splice site II: 512 bp. 5% of products were resolved on 6% PAGE gels and detected by silver staining. The PCR reaction was optimized for linear range amplification to allow for quantification of products. Densitometric analyses of bands were done using Un-Scan ITTM Analysis Software (Silk Scientific). The pSPL3 vector (27Church D.M. Stotler C.J. Rutter J.L. Murrell J.R. Trofatter J.A. Buckler A.J. Nat. Genet. 1994; 6: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) contains an HIV genomic fragment with truncated tat exons 2 and 3 inserted into rabbit β-globin coding sequences. The resulting hybrid exons in pSPL3 are globin E1E2-tat exon 2 and tat exon 3-globin E3 separated by more than 2.5 kilobase pairs of tat intron sequence. pSPL3 contains a multiple cloning sequence (MCS) around 300 nucleotides downstream of the tat exon 2 5′ splice site. The SV40 promoter and polyadenylation signal allow for enhanced expression in NT2 cells. There are several cryptic 5′ splice sites, which interfere with minigene splicing and hence sections of the original pSPL3 vector were deleted. First, 874 bp of the tat intronic section lying upstream of SA was deleted. It was designed such that the deletion began 158 bp upstream of SA thereby maintaining the branch point and pyrimidine tract. Primers to amplify genomic PKCδ from NT2 cells were designed using the Gene Tool Software (Bio Tools Inc.) and include the BclI site in the forward primer (in bold type) and BcuI site in the reverse primers (in bold type). The forward primer was designed such that the product will contain the branch point and 3′ splice site. Following amplification of the product, it was ligated into the digested pSPL3 vector. The pSPL3 vector was digested with BamHI (in the MCS) and NheI within the tat intronic sequence which removes an additional 930 bases. The overhangs of the selected restriction enzymes can hybridize and this enabled cloning of the PCR product in the proper orientation. To increase the efficiency and number of positive clones, the ligation reaction was digested with the above restriction enzymes, which cleave any dimers produced by the ligation reaction. The product was verified by restriction digestion and sequencing. The primers used to generate pSPL3-PKCδ minigene were: forward primer 5′ CCTTGATCATGGGAGTTCTGATAATGGTC 3′; reverse primer 5′ CCTACTAGTATCGGGTCTCAGTCTACAC 3′ such that 200 bp of the 5′ intronic sequence was included. The products were ligated into the digested pSPL3 vector and transformed into bacteria using TOP10F cells (Invitrogen). Truncated minigenes were verified by restriction digestion and sequencing. The SC35 cis-element (sequence: ggccaaag) identified on the 5′ intronic sequence flanking exon 10 of PKCδ pre-mRNA was mutated in the pSPL3_PKCδ minigene to tagcccata using QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), which allows for blue-white screening per the manufacturer's instructions. The mutated minigene, pSPL3_PKCδ**, was verified by sequencing. The templates used were F1 (which contains PKCδ exon 10 and 120 bp of its 5′ intronic sequence including the putative SC35 binding site); mutated F1 (F1m, same region as F1 but putative SC35 binding site was mutated as described above) and F2 (which is PKCδ exon 10 alone). Single-stranded RNAs were synthesized in vitro using the T7 RNA polymerase and purified on denaturing polyacrylamide gels prior to RNA binding assays. The transcripts were 5′ biotinylated with 0.1 mm biotin-21 as described before (28Gallego M.E. Gattoni R. Stévenin J. Marie J. Expert-Bezançon A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1772-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). RNA gel shift mobility assay was performed with 10 fmol of labeled RNA and 5 ng of recombinant SC35 (ProteinOne) in a 20-μl binding reaction (100 mm Tris, 500 mm KCl, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5% glycerol, 2 units/μl RNAsin) and incubated at 30 °C for 20 min. The complex was run on 8% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nylon membrane. Western blot analysis was performed using avidin-HRP conjugate (Pierce). Gels were densitometrically analyzed using UN-SCAN-ITTM software (Silk Scientific, Inc.) PRISMTM software was used for statistical analysis. The results were expressed as mean ± S.E. of densitometric units or as percent exon inclusion. In humans, the PKCδ gene has at least two alternatively spliced variants: PKCδI and PKCδVIII (Fig. 1a). PKCδVIII is generated via alternative splicing of the PKCδ pre-mRNA such that 93 nucleotides are included in the mature PKCδVIII mRNA. This translates to 31 amino acids whose inclusion disrupts the caspase-3 recognition sequence in the hinge region of PKCδVIII protein. Our previous study demonstrated that PKCδVIII functions as a pro-survival protein whereas PKCδI promotes apoptosis. Further, we demonstrated that RA (24 h) significantly increased the expression of PKCδVIII in NT2 cells (1Jiang K. Apostolatos A.H. Ghansah T. Watson J.E. Vickers T. Cooper D.R. Epling-Burnette P.K. Patel N.A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 787-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Here, we sought to extend our findings in primary neuronal cells derived from human adult hippocampus (see “Experimental Procedures”) to demonstrate the physiological significance of the expression pattern of PKCδVIII in human hippocampus and its response to RA. We performed quantitative, two-step real-time RT-PCR using Syber (SYBR) Green technology (29Walton H.S. Gebhardt F.M. Innes D.J. Dodd P.R. J. Neurosci. Methods. 2007; 160: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 30Chand H.S. Ness S.A. Kisiel W. Int. J. Cancer. 2006; 118: 1713-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 31Ise R. Han D. Takahashi Y. Terasaka S. Inoue A. Tanji M. Kiyama R. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 1732-1740Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The primers were specific to the exon junctions of PKCδI mRNA and PKCδVIII mRNA as shown in Fig. 1b. Each transcript was normalized to the endogenous control, GAPDH, to obtain absolute quantification. We demonstrate that PKCδVIII increased with RA treatment whereas PKCδI levels remain constant in human primary neuronal cells (Fig. 1c). Alternative splicing is regulated by recruiting trans-factors such as serine-arginine-rich (SR) proteins that bind to exonic or intronic splicing enhancers (ESE, ISE) on the pre-mRNA. Hence, the elucidation of trans-factors involved in RA-mediated PKCδ alternative splicing is of critical importance. NT2 cells were treated with or without RA (24 h), and whole cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot analysis using mAb104 antibody that simultaneously detects the phosphoepitopes on all SR proteins. Our results indicated that upon RA treatment, SR protein at ∼30 kDa increased in expression (Fig. 2a). SF2/ASF or SC35 (i.e. SRp30a or SRp30b, respectively) are two SR proteins with molecular masses of ∼30 kDa. Hence, antibodies specific to these individual SR proteins were used next. We observed an increase in SC35 (SRp30b) concurrent with increased PKCδVIII levels in response to RA while SF2/ASF (SRp30a) expression remained relatively constant (Fig. 2b). The observed increase of SC35 with RA reflects total expression levels of SC35. The increases seen with mAb104 antibody, which detects the phosphoepitope, is a reflection of its increased expression rather than increased phosphorylation. SC35, also known as SFRS2 or SRp30b, is a member of the SR splicing protein family and functions as a splicing enhancer (32Liu H.X. Chew S.L. Cartegni L. Zhang M.Q. Krainer A.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1063-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). SC35 was transiently transfected into NT2 cells to determine whether it could mimic the effect of RA in increasing the expression of PKCδVIII. SF2/ASF was used as a control and transfected into a separate well. RT-PCR performed using human PKCδ primers which amplified both PKCδI and PKCδVIII products. Simultaneously, Western blot analysis was performed with PKCδVIII-specific antibody. An increase in endogenous PKCδVIII levels in cells overexpressing SC35 was observed (Fig. 3, a–c) while in SF2/ASF transfected cells PKCδVIII expression remained constant. GAPDH was used as internal control for all samples. To determine whether PKCδVIII expression levels increased in direct proportion with SC35, increasing amounts of SC35 (0–2 μg) were transfected into NT2 cells. Total RNA or whole cell lysates were collected. RT-PCR was performed using PKCδ primers that detect PKCδI and PKCδVIII mRNA, and Western blot analysis was carried out using antibodies for PKCδVIII, SC35, and GAPDH (internal control). As seen in Fig. 3d, PKCδVIII mRNA levels increased with increasing levels of SC35 while PKCδI mRNA levels appeared unaffected. Further, PKCδVIII protein levels (Fig. 3e) increased with increasing doses of SC35 comparable to the increase in PKCδVIII protein seen with RA treatment. To determine the effect of SC35 knockdown on the RA-mediated expression of PKCδVIII, siRNA specific for SC35 were transfected in increasing amounts (0–150 nm) into NT2 cells and treated with RA. Two sets of SC35 siRNA along with its scrambled control were used to validate specificity and eliminate off-target knockdowns. Results indicated similar data with either SC35 siRNAs. Total RNA or whole cell lysates were collected. RT-PCR was performed using PKCδ primers while Western blot analysis was carried out using antibodies for PKCδVIII, SC35, and GAPDH. As seen in Fig. 4a, PKCδVIII mRNA levels decreased with increasing levels of SC35 siRNA while PKCδI mRNA levels appeared unaffected. Further, PKCδVIII protein levels decreased with increasing doses of SC35 siRNA (Fig. 4b). The graph is representative of four individual experiments performed with either SC35 siRNA. The above data confirms that RA cannot promote PKCδVIII expression in the absence of SC35. This demonstrates the involvement of SC35 in RA-mediated alternative splicing of PKCδ pre-mRNA. Previous studies identified consensus sequences (33Ladd A.N. Cooper T.A. Genomic Biol. 2002; 3: 1-16Crossref Google Scholar) for several cis-elements present either in the exonic or intronic sequences of pre-mRNA. These consensus sequences serve as a guideline to dissect and analyze putative cis-elements in alternative splicing of pre-mRNA. We combined a web-based resource “ESE finder” (34Cartegni L. Wang J. Zhu Z. Zhang M.Q. Krainer A.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3568-3571Crossref PubMed Scopus (1240) Google Scholar) and also manually checked for published consensus sequences of cis-elements on PKCδ pre-mRNA to predict putative enhancer and silencer elements that could recruit trans-factors in RA-regulated alternative splicing of PKCδ. To focus on identifying the cis-elements involved in RA-mediated increase in PKCδVIII mRNA levels, antisense oligonucleotides (ASO) (synthesized by Isis Pharmaceuticals, Carlsbad, CA), which are 2′-methoxyethyl-modified, RNase-H resistant were used. These ASOs inhibit binding of trans-factors to their cis-elements without disrupting the splicing event or degrading the mRNA (35Patel N.A. Eichler D.C. Chappell D.S. Illingworth P.A. Chalfant C.E.

Graham M.J. Lemonidis K.M. Zhao C. Dean N.M. J. Immunol. 2006; 176: 3652-3661Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We transfected a series of 20mer ASOs, which were designed according to predicted enhancer and silencer sites such that they sequentially spanned the unspliced PKCδ pre-mRNA. All wells were also treated with RA and RT-PCR was performed. Transfection of ASO 81 (which spans the putative SC35 binding site) showed a significant decrease in RA-induced PKCδVIII splicing while the other ASOs did not affect the expression of PKCδVIII induced by RA (data not shown). Results (Fig. 5, a and b) shown here represent three experiments performed individually using the scrambled ASO as control, ASO 81 and ASO 80 (which was in close proximity to ASO 81 but did not inhibit RA-mediated PKCδVIII alternative splicing). ASO 81 corresponded to the SC35 binding site as identified by ESE finder and further determined by its consensus sequence, ggccaaag. These results demonstrated that ASO 81 inhibited RA-induced PKCδVIII alternative splicing. This also suggested the position of SC35 cis-element on PKCδ pre-mRNA to be in the intronic region downstream of PKCδ exon 10 and before 5′ splice site II (schematic in Fig. 5a). Splicing minigenes are advantageous to identify cis-elements on the pre-mRNA involved in regulated alternative splicing. Further, minigenes aid to correlate the binding of specific SR proteins to individual splicing events. Hence, to dissect the mechanism of RA-mediated regulation of endogenous PKCδ alternative splicing and analyze factors influencing 5′ splice site selection, a PKCδ heterologous minigene was developed. Since the human PKCδ splice variants used alternative 5′ splice sites as determined previously (1Jiang K. Apostolatos A.H. Ghansah T. Watson J.E. Vickers T. Cooper D.R. Epling-Burnette P.K. Patel N.A. Biochemistry. 2008; 47: 787-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), exon 10 of PKCδ pre-mRNA along with its flanking 3′ and 5′ intronic sequences was cloned (as described under “Experimental Procedures”) in the multiple cloning site (MCS) between the splice donor (SD) and splice acceptor (SA) exons of pSPL3, a vector developed to study splicing events (schematic shown in Fig. 6a). 5′ splice site II (which encodes for PKCδVIII mRNA) is 93 bp downstream of PKCδ exon 10, and hence we cloned 200 bp of the 5′ intronic sequence. The minigene also contains a retinoic acid response element (RARE) in its promoter region. The resulting minigene, pSPL3_PKCδ, was confirmed using restriction digestion and sequencing. Mi"
https://openalex.org/W2056154019,"Caldecrin/chymotrypsin C is a novel secretory-type serine protease that was originally isolated as a serum calcium-decreasing factor from the pancreas. Previously, we reported that caldecrin suppressed the bone-resorbing activity of rabbit mature osteoclasts (Tomomura, A., Yamada, H., Fujimoto, K., Inaba, A., and Katoh, S. (2001) FEBS Lett. 508, 454-458). Here, we investigated the effects of caldecrin on mouse osteoclast differentiation induced by macrophage-colony stimulating factor and the receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) from the monocyte/macrophage cell lineage of bone marrow cells. Wild-type and protease-deficient mutant caldecrin dose-dependently inhibited RANKL-stimulated tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive osteoclast formation from bone marrow cells. Caldecrin did not affect macrophage colony formation from monocyte/macrophage lineage cells or osteoclast progenitor generation in cultures of bone marrow cells. Caldecrin inhibited accumulation of the RANKL-stimulated nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1) mRNA in bone marrow cells, which is a key transcription factor for the differentiation of osteoclasts. Caldecrin also suppressed RANKL-induced differentiation of the RAW264.7 monocyte/macrophage cell line into osteoclasts. Caldecrin reduced the transcriptional activity of NFATc1 in RAW264.7 cells, whereas those of NF-kappaB and c-Fos, which are also transcription factors involved in osteoclast differentiation, were unaffected. Caldecrin inhibited RANKL-stimulated nuclear translocation of NFATc1 and the activity of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin. Caldecrin inhibited phospholipase Cgamma1-mediated Ca(2+) oscillation evoked by RANKL stimulation. RANKL-stimulated phosphorylation of spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) was also attenuated by caldecrin. Taken together, these results indicate that caldecrin inhibits osteoclastogenesis, without its protease activity, by preventing a phospholipase Cgamma1-mediated Ca(2+)oscillation-calcineurin-NFATc1 pathway."

Heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans (HSGAGs) are essential for FGF signaling as they promote FGF·FGF receptor (FGFR) binding and dimerization. Using novel organic synthesis protocols to prepare homogeneously sulfated heparin mimetics (HM), including hexasaccharide (HM6), octasaccharide (HM8), and decasaccharide (HM10), we tested the ability of these HM to support FGF1 and FGF2 signaling through FGFR4. Biological assays show that both HM8 and HM10 are significantly more potent than HM6 in promoting FGF2-mediated FGFR4 signaling. In contrast, all three HM have comparable activity in promoting FGF1·FGFR4 signaling. To understand the molecular basis for these differential activities in FGF1/2·FGFR4 signaling, we used NMR spectroscopy, isothermal titration calorimetry, and size-exclusion chromatography to characterize binding interactions of FGF1/2 with the isolated Ig-domain 2 (D2) of FGFR4 in the presence of HM, and binary interactions of FGFs and D2 with HM. Our data confirm the existence of both a secondary FGF1·FGFR4 interaction site and a direct FGFR4·FGFR4 interaction site thus supporting the formation of the symmetric mode of FGF·FGFR dimerization in solution. Moreover, our results show that the observed higher activity of HM8 relative to HM6 in stimulating FGF2·FGFR4 signaling correlates with the higher affinity of HM8 to bind and dimerize FGF2. Notably FGF2·HM8 exhibits pronounced positive binding cooperativity. Based on our findings we propose a refined symmetric FGF·FGFR dimerization model, which incorporates the differential ability of HM to dimerize FGFs.

A unique property of FGFR is the presence of a stretch of acidic residues in the linker connecting D1 to D2, referred to as the “acid box.” A wealth of structural and biochemical studies has demonstrated that D2, D3, and D2–D3 linker are necessary and sufficient for FGF binding (8Mohammadi M.

Alternative splicing of D1 and the D1–D2 linker serves as a mechanism to modulate receptor autoinhibition, whereas alternative splicing in D3 determines ligand binding specificity (35Miki T.

The “b” exon is used in epithelial tissues, whereas the “c” exon is preferentially used in mesenchymal tissues. As a result of this splicing event, the number of principal FGFRs is increased to seven isoforms namely FGFR1b, FGFR1c, FGFR2b, FGFR2c, FGFR3b, FGFR3c, and FGFR4. Importantly, alternative splicing of D3 sets a specificity barrier such that epithelially expressed FGFs activate FGFRc isoforms, whereas mesenchymally expressed FGFs activate FGFRb isoforms (42Zhang X.

Most FGFs bind and activate more than one of the seven principal FGFRs, although they do not cross the specificity barrier set by the D3 alternative splicing (43Ornitz D.M. Xu J. Colvin J.S.

For example, FGF2 exhibits high affinity to both FGFR1c and FGFR2c but does not bind to FGFR1b and FGFR2b. The affinity of FGF2 to FGFR3c and FGFR4 is also negligible (44Ibrahimi O.A. Zhang F. Eliseenkova A.V. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). FGF1 is an exception, because it is capable of indiscriminately binding both “b” and “c” isoforms of FGFR1–3 and FGFR4 (42Zhang X. Ibrahimi O.A. Olsen S.K. Umemori H. Mohammadi M. Ornitz D.M. J.

According to a symmetric model (Mohammadi model, FGFR1·FGF2·heparin (decasaccharide), PDB entry 1FQ9) (23Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 743-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar) HS promotes formation of a symmetric 2:2:2 FGF·FGFR signaling complex. The dimer interface is mediated by protein-protein contacts between the two adjacent FGF·FGFR halves and is strengthened by interaction of heparin with FGF and FGFR. The dimer interface comprises direct receptor-receptor contacts mediated by D2, and interactions of FGF from one FGF·FGFR half with D2 of FGFR in the second FGF·FGFR half (referred to as secondary FGF·FGFR interface). At the membrane distal end of the dimer, the individual HS-binding sites of two FGFs and FGFRs unite into one HS-binding canyon into which two HS chains bind. By engaging the HS-binding sites of FGF and FGFRs, HS augments FGF·FGFR affinity within each FGF·FGFR half as well as promotes the dimer interface (8Mohammadi M. Olsen S.K. Ibrahimi O.A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 107-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 52Mohammadi M. Olsen S.K. Goetz R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 506-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).In this structure, only the first six sugar units at the non-reducing end of the decasaccharide are in contact with the protein (FGFR or FGF). The remaining four sugar units of one of two decasaccharides are disordered. In the other decasaccharide, two additional sugar units are visible due to the favorable crystal contacts they make with an adjacent FGF molecule. Thus, based on the symmetric model, a hexasaccharide should be sufficient for dimerization and hence biological activity (8Mohammadi M. Olsen S.K. Ibrahimi O.A. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 107-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 52Mohammadi M. Olsen S.K. Goetz R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 506-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar).A different model has been proposed by Blundell and coworkers (Blundell model, FGFR2c·FGF1·HS, PDB entry 1E0O) (24Pellegrini L. Burke D.F. von Delft F. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). This model displays a 2:2:1 FGF·FGFR·HS stoichiometry in which a single HS chain bridges two FGFs in trans and each FGF binds to one FGFR only. In contrast to the symmetric model, there are no direct protein-protein contacts between the two FGF·FGFR halves in this model. In other words, the asymmetric dimer is held together solely by the ability of HS to dimerize FGFs, and consequently this mode of dimerization is strictly HS-dependent.The entire co-crystallized decasaccharide is visible in this structure. Two sugar units at the non-reducing end of oligosaccharide engage the D2 domain of one of the two FGFR chains while the HSGAG-binding site of the other FGFR chain remains unoccupied. Seven sugar rings bridge the two FGFs in trans. Based on this model, the shortest biologically active HS would be an octasaccharide, although maximal activity would require a dodecasaccharide, because it will be long enough such that it could engage D2 of both FGFRs (24Pellegrini L. Burke D.F. von Delft F. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). It should be noted, however, that an alternative interpretation of this crystal structure also leads to a model similar to the symmetric one (52Mohammadi M. Olsen S.K. Goetz R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2005; 15: 506-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 53Goodger S.J. Robinson C.J. Murphy K.J. Gasiunas N. Harmer N.J. Blundell T.L. Pye D.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13001-13008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).Numerous in vitro and cell-based studies have been attempted to test the salient features of each model. Most data support the physiological relevance of the symmetric dimerization model. For example, mutations that ablate interactions of FGF from one FGF·FGFR half to D2 of FGFR in the second FGF·FGFR half diminish the ability of the mutated FGF to signal while these mutated FGFs retain the ability to form a 1:1 FGF·FGFR complex (54Ibrahimi O.A. Yeh B.K. Eliseenkova A.V. Zhang F. Olsen S.K. Igarashi M. Aaronson S.A. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 671-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A further unbiased piece of evidence in support of a symmetric model comes from analysis of the naturally occurring A172F mutation in FGFR2. This gain-of-function mutation, responsible for the Pfeiffer syndrome, maps to the direct FGFR·FGFR interface and confers gain-of-function by promoting direct D2–D2 contacts and hence receptor dimerization (54Ibrahimi O.A. Yeh B.K. Eliseenkova A.V. Zhang F. Olsen S.K. Igarashi M. Aaronson S.A. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 671-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Biological studies with size-fractioned heparin oligosaccharides have also been used to test the validity of each model. However, no consensus has been reached with regard to the minimal oligosaccharide length needed for FGF signaling. Some studies show that a hexasaccharide and even smaller sugars are capable of promoting FGF signaling (55Wu Z.L. Lech M. Beeler D.L. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1861-1866Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 56Delehedde M. Lyon M. Gallagher J.T. Rudland P.S. Fernig D.G. Biochem.

Chem. 2005; 280: 33749-33755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In contrast, other data show that a hexasaccharide has either poor or no activity at all and that an octasaccharide is the shortest biologically active heparin (53Goodger S.J. Robinson C.J. Murphy K.J. Gasiunas N. Harmer N.J. Blundell T.L. Pye D.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13001-13008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In all these prior studies, the heparin oligosaccharides were prepared by either enzymatic hydrolysis or chemical cleavage of heparin isolated from natural sources. Therefore, a potential reason for the disparity between these data could be differences in the homogeneity of oligosaccharide preparations used. Our ability to de novo synthesize homogeneously sulfated heparin oligosaccharides of various degrees of polymerization, including hexasaccharide (HM6), octasaccharide (HM8), and decasaccharide (HM10) (Fig. 1A), provided us with the unique opportunity to revisit the minimum oligosaccharide length requirement for FGF signaling. Using a BaF3 cell line overexpressing a chimeric FGFR4, we show differences in the abilities of these HM to promote FGF1 and FGF2 signaling through FGFR4. All three HM have comparable capacity to stimulate FGF1-FGFR4 signaling. In contrast, in the case of FGF2, a major activity difference in signaling is seen for the transition from HM6 to HM8/10.To understand the molecular basis for the observed prominent activity differences between HM in promoting FGF1- and FGF2·FGFR4 signaling, we used NMR spectroscopy, ITC, and SEC to study the interactions of FGF1 and FGF2 with the isolated D2 of FGFR4 (the HSGAG-binding domain of FGFR4) in the presence and absence of HM6 and HM8. Because HM8 and HM10 displayed similar receptor activation level in biological assays, our biophysical studies were restricted to HM8. NMR chemical shift mapping, signal attenuation, and T2 relaxation studies show the existence of a secondary FGF·FGFR D2 interaction site as well as direct D2–D2 interaction site corresponding to those seen in 1FQ9 thus providing direct evidence that the symmetric mode of dimerization occurs in solution. Our data show that the two HM make identical sets of contacts with FGF and FGFR D2 in the 2:2 FGF·D2 dimers. Therefore, the higher activity of HM8 relative to HM6 is not due to the additional contacts of the two extra sugar rings of HM8 with FGF or FGFR D2. Rather, our data show that differences in the binding affinity of HM for FGFs along with differences in the ability of HM to dimerize FGFs correlate with the differences in the biologic activities of the FGFs. Based on our findings we propose a refined symmetric model that takes into account the differential abilities of HM to dimerize FGF2 in a cooperative fashion.DISCUSSIONUsing organic chemistry methods we were able to de novo synthesize chemically pure sulfated heparin hexasaccharide (HM6), octasaccharide (HM8), and decasaccharide (HM10). We showed that HM8 is significantly more potent than HM6, while HM10 displays similar potency as HM8 in promoting FGF2-mediated FGFR4 signaling. Interestingly, the prominent effect in biological activity of the octasaccharide relies on its interaction with FGF2, because FGF1·HM6/8/10 activation only resulted in relatively small changes in FGFR4 signaling.To delineate the underlying molecular basis for higher efficacy of HM8 relative to HM6 we used NMR, ITC, and SEC to characterize binding interactions of FGF1 and FGF2 with isolated Ig-domain 2 (D2) of FGFR4 in the presence of heparin mimetics, and binary interactions of FGFs and D2 with HM. Our NMR data in solution support the symmetric dimerization model proposed by Mohammadi and colleagues (23Schlessinger J. Plotnikov A.N. Ibrahimi O.A. Eliseenkova A.V. Yeh B.K. Yayon A. Linhardt R.J. Mohammadi M. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 743-750Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (948) Google Scholar) for HM6 and HM8 in contrast to the conclusion of Goodger and coworkers (53Goodger S.J. Robinson C.J. Murphy K.J. Gasiunas N. Harmer N.J. Blundell T.L. Pye D.A. Gallagher J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 13001-13008Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) who proposed an asymmetric ternary complex formation (24Pellegrini L. Burke D.F. von Delft F. Mulloy B. Blundell T.L. Nature. 2000; 407: 1029-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) for octasaccharides and larger heparin fragments. Our observed symmetric complex in solution is transient, and HM8 (compared with HM6) shifts the equilibrium more strongly toward the ternary complex for both FGF1 and FGF2. Importantly, the NMR data show that the higher efficacy of HM8 relative to HM6 is not due to the ability of HM8 to make additional contacts with FGF or D2.Analysis of the binary interaction of HM with the D2 domain of FGFR4, which harbors the heparin binding site, shows that HM6 and HM8 bind D2 with ∼1 μm KD, in agreement with previous reports (70Loo B.M.

Therefore, the differences in affinity appear too small to account for the observed differences in potency between HM6 and HM8. A tendency of HM8 to dimerize the receptor already in the absence of FGF could be observed, an interesting finding in light of the reported heparin sensitivity of FGFR4 (69Gao G. Goldfarb M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2183-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar).In contrast to the findings of Goodger and coworkers (53Goodger S.J. Robinson C.J. Murphy K.J. Gasiunas N. Harmer N.J.

The observed binding epitopes correspond to the heparin binding sites observed in the published crystallographic studies (21Faham S. Hileman R.E. Fromm J.R. Linhardt R.J. Rees D.C.

Here, we investigated the molecular and cellular manifestation of the TFIIH compositional changes by XPG truncation mutations. We showed that both core TFIIH and CAK are rapidly recruited to damage sites in repair-proficient cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation against TFIIH and CAK components revealed a physical engagement of CAK in nucleotide excision repair (NER). While XPD recruitment to DNA damage was normal, CAK was not recruited in severe XP-G and XP-G/CS cells, indicating that the associations of CAK and XPD to core TFIIH are differentially affected. A CAK inhibition approach showed that CAK activity is not required for assembling pre-incision machinery in vivo or for removing genomic photolesions. Instead, CAK is involved in Ser5-phosphorylation and UV-induced degradation of RNA polymerase II. The CAK inhibition impaired transcription from undamaged and UV-damaged reporter, and partially decreased transcription of p53-dependent genes. The overall results demonstrated that a) XP-G/CS mutations affect the disassembly state of TFIIH resulting in the dissociation of CAK, but not XPD from core TFIIH, and b) CAK activity is not essential for global genomic repair but involved in general transcription and damage-induced RNA polymerase II degradation."
https://openalex.org/W2153104803,"Acquired drug resistance represents a frequent obstacle which hampers efficient chemotherapy of cancers. The contribution of aberrant DNA methylation to the development of drug resistant tumor cells has gained increasing attention over the past decades. Hence, the objective of the presented study was to characterize DNA methylation changes which arise from treatment of tumor cells with the chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. DNA methylation levels from CpG islands (CGIs) linked to twenty-eight genes, whose expression levels had previously been shown to contribute to resistance against DNA double strand break inducing drugs or tumor progression in different cancer types were analyzed. High-definition DNA methylation profiles which consisted of methylation levels from 800 CpG sites mapping to CGIs around the transcription start sites of the selected genes were determined. In order to investigate the influence of CGI methylation on the expression of associated genes, their mRNA levels were investigated via qRT-PCR. It was shown that the employed method is suitable for providing highly accurate methylation profiles, comparable to those obtained via clone sequencing, the gold standard for high-definition DNA methylation studies. In breast carcinoma cells with acquired resistance against the double strand break inducing drug doxorubicin, changes in methylation of specific cytosines from CGIs linked to thirteen genes were detected. Moreover, similarities between methylation profiles obtained from breast and ovarian carcinoma cell lines with acquired doxorubicin resistance were found. The expression levels of a subset of analyzed genes were shown to be linked to the methylation levels of the analyzed CGIs. Our results provide detailed DNA methylation information from two separate model systems for acquired doxorubicin resistance and suggest the occurrence of similar methylation changes in both systems upon exposure to the drug."
https://openalex.org/W1964349490,"This study investigated the expression and tissue distribution of inositol monophosphatase (IMPA1) and characterized its role in salinity adaptation in the eel. The coding sequence of eel IMPA1 was determined and confirmed to be orthologous to the mammalian gene/enzyme by phylogenetic analysis and structural modeling. Quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot techniques indicated up to 17-fold increases in mRNA expression and 2-fold increases in protein abundance in major osmoregulatory tissues following transfer of fish to seawater (SW). This was accompanied by up to 5-fold increases in enzyme activity, and 1.8- and 3-fold increases in inositol contents within the gill and kidney, respectively. Immunohistological studies revealed that IMPA1 protein expression predominated in SW-acclimated fish within basal epithelial/epidermal layers of the gill, esophagus, intestine, skin, and fins. SW transfer also induced a 10-fold increase in inositol content in the fin. IMPA1 immunoreactivity was also identified in chondrocytes within the cartilagenous matrix of the gills and fins, as well as in clusters of interstitial cells surrounding the kidney tubules. The observed increases in expression of IMPA1 highlight a protective role for inositol within various eel tissues following SW acclimation. This constitutes an adaptive mechanism in teleost fish naturally exposed to hypertonic environments."
https://openalex.org/W1983217851,"Osteoclasts resorb bone through the formation of a unique attachment structure called the sealing zone. In this study, a role for thyroid hormone receptor-interacting protein 6 (TRIP6) in sealing zone formation and osteoclast activity was examined. TRIP6 was shown to reside in the sealing zone through its association with tropomyosin 4, an actin-binding protein that regulates sealing dimensions and bone resorptive capacity. Suppression of TRIP6 in mature osteoclasts by RNA interference altered sealing zone dimensions and inhibited bone resorption, whereas overexpression of TRIP6 increased the sealing zone perimeter and enhanced bone resorption. Treatment of osteoclasts with lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which phosphorylates TRIP6 at tyrosine 55 through a c-Src-dependent mechanism, caused increased association of TRIP6 with the sealing zone, as did overexpression of a TRIP6 cDNA bearing a phosphomimetic mutation at tyrosine 55. Further, LPA treatment caused increases in osteoclast fusion, sealing zone perimeter, and bone resorptive capacity. In contrast, overexpression of TRIP6 containing a nonphosphorylatable amino acid residue at position 55 severely diminished sealing zone formation and bone resorption and suppressed the effects of LPA on the cytoskeleton. LPA effects were mediated through its receptor isoform LPA(2), as indicated by treatments with receptor-specific agonists and antagonists. Thus, these studies suggest that TRIP6 is a critical downstream regulator of c-Src signaling and that its phosphorylation is permissive for its presence in the sealing zone where it plays a positive role in osteoclast bone resorptive capacity."
https://openalex.org/W1983444422,"Universal access to first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV infection is becoming more of a reality in most low and middle income countries in Asia. However, second-line therapies are relatively scarce.We developed a mathematical model of an HIV epidemic in a Southeast Asian setting and used it to forecast the impact of treatment plans, without second-line options, on the potential degree of acquisition and transmission of drug resistant HIV strains. We show that after 10 years of universal treatment access, up to 20% of treatment-naïve individuals with HIV may have drug-resistant strains but it depends on the relative fitness of viral strains.If viral load testing of people on ART is carried out on a yearly basis and virological failure leads to effective second-line therapy, then transmitted drug resistance could be reduced by 80%. Greater efforts are required for minimizing first-line failure, to detect virological failure earlier, and to procure access to second-line therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2067161950,"In recent years, capabilities for genotyping large sets of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) has increased considerably with the ability to genotype over 1 million SNP markers across the genome. This advancement in technology has led to an increase in the number of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for various complex traits. These GWAS have resulted in the implication of over 1500 SNPs associated with disease traits. However, the SNPs identified from these GWAS are not necessarily the functional variants. Therefore, the next phase in GWAS will involve the refining of these putative loci.A next step for GWAS would be to catalog all variants, especially rarer variants, within the detected loci, followed by the association analysis of the detected variants with the disease trait. However, sequencing a locus in a large number of subjects is still relatively expensive. A more cost effective approach would be to sequence a portion of the individuals, followed by the application of genotype imputation methods for imputing markers in the remaining individuals. A potentially attractive alternative option would be to impute based on the 1000 Genomes Project; however, this has the drawbacks of using a reference population that does not necessarily match the disease status and LD pattern of the study population. We explored a variety of approaches for carrying out the imputation using a reference panel consisting of sequence data for a fraction of the study participants using data from both a candidate gene sequencing study and the 1000 Genomes Project.Imputation of genetic variation based on a proportion of sequenced samples is feasible. Our results indicate the following sequencing study design guidelines which take advantage of the recent advances in genotype imputation methodology: Select the largest and most diverse reference panel for sequencing and genotype as many ""anchor"" markers as possible."
https://openalex.org/W2000227309,"Background Cellular cholesterol is a vital component of the cell membrane. Its concentration is tightly controlled by mechanisms that remain only partially characterized. In this study, we describe a late endosome/lysosomes–associated protein whose expression level affects cellular free cholesterol content. Methodology/Principal Findings Using a restricted proteomic analysis of detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs), we have identified a protein encoded by gene C11orf59. It is mainly localized to late endosome/lysosome (LE/LY) compartment through N-terminal myristoylation and palmitoylation. We named it Pdro for protein associated with DRMs and endosomes. Very recently, three studies have reported on the same protein under two other names: the human p27RF-Rho that regulates RhoA activation and actin dynamics, and its rodent orthologue p18 that controls both LE/LY dynamics through the MERK-ERK pathway and the lysosomal activation of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 by amino acids. We found that, consistent with the presence of sterol-responsive element consensus sequences in the promoter region of C11orf59, Pdro mRNA and protein expression levels are regulated positively by cellular cholesterol depletion and negatively by cellular cholesterol loading. Conversely, Pdro is involved in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis, since its depletion by siRNA increases cellular free cholesterol content that is accompanied by an increased cholesterol efflux from cells. On the other hand, cells stably overexpressing Pdro display reduced cellular free cholesterol content. Pdro depletion-mediated excess cholesterol results, at least in part, from a stimulated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake and an increased cholesterol egress from LE/LY. Conclusions/Significance LDL-derived cholesterol release involves LE/LY motility that is linked to actin dynamics. Because Pdro regulates these two processes, we propose that modulation of Pdro expression in response to sterol levels regulates LDL-derived cholesterol through both LDL uptake and LE/LY dynamics, to ultimately control free cholesterol homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2144353673,"Even with the advent of nucleic acid (NA) amplification technologies the culture of mycobacteria for diagnostic and other applications remains of critical importance. Notably microscopic observed drug susceptibility testing (MODS), as opposed to traditional culture on solid media or automated liquid culture, has shown potential to both speed up and increase the provision of mycobacterial culture in high burden settings.Here we explore the growth of Mycobacterial tuberculosis microcolonies, imaged by automated digital microscopy, cultured on a porous aluminium oxide (PAO) supports. Repeated imaging during colony growth greatly simplifies ""computer vision"" and presumptive identification of microcolonies was achieved here using existing publically available algorithms. Our system thus allows the growth of individual microcolonies to be monitored and critically, also to change the media during the growth phase without disrupting the microcolonies. Transfer of identified microcolonies onto selective media allowed us, within 1-2 bacterial generations, to rapidly detect the drug susceptibility of individual microcolonies, eliminating the need for time consuming subculturing or the inoculation of multiple parallel cultures.Monitoring the phenotype of individual microcolonies as they grow has immense potential for research, screening, and ultimately M. tuberculosis diagnostic applications. The method described is particularly appealing with respect to speed and automation."
https://openalex.org/W1976388831,"Background Recombinant interferon treatment can result in several common side effects including fever and injection-site pain. Patients are often advised to use acetaminophen or other over-the-counter pain medications as needed. Little is known regarding the transcriptional changes induced by such co-administration. Methodology/Principal Findings We tested whether the administration of acetaminophen causes a change in the response normally induced by interferon-β treatment. CD-1 mice were administered acetaminophen (APAP), interferon-β (IFN-β) or a combination of IFN-β+APAP and liver and serum samples were collected for analysis. Differential gene expression was determined using an Agilent 22 k whole mouse genome microarray. Data were analyzed by several methods including Gene Ontology term clustering and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. We observed a significant change in the transcription profile of hepatic cells when APAP was co-administered with IFN-β. These transcriptional changes included a marked up-regulation of genes involved in signal transduction and cell differentiation and down-regulation of genes involved in cellular metabolism, trafficking and the IκBK/NF-κB cascade. Additionally, we observed a large decrease in the expression of several IFN-induced genes including Ifit-3, Isg-15, Oasl1, Zbp1 and predicted gene EG634650 at both early and late time points. Conclusions/Significance A significant change in the transcriptional response was observed following co-administration of IFN-β+APAP relative to IFN-β treatment alone. These results suggest that administration of acetaminophen has the potential to modify the efficacy of IFN-β treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2055989204,"Tight regulation of developmental pathways is of critical importance to all organisms, and is achieved by a transcriptional cascade ensuring the coordinated expression of sets of genes. We aimed to explore whether a strong signal is required to enter and complete a developmental pathway, by using meiosis in budding yeast as a model. We demonstrate that meiosis in budding yeast is insensitive to drastic changes in the levels of its consecutive positive regulators (Ime1, Ime2, and Ndt80). Entry into DNA replication is not correlated with the time of transcription of the early genes that regulate this event. Entry into nuclear division is directly regulated by the time of transcription of the middle genes, as premature transcription of their activator NDT80, leads to a premature entry into the first meiotic division, and loss of coordination between DNA replication and nuclear division. We demonstrate that Cdk1/Cln3 functions as a negative regulator of Ime2, and that ectopic expression of Cln3 delays entry into nuclear division as well as NDT80 transcription. Because Ime2 functions as a positive regulator for premeiotic DNA replication and NDT80 transcription, as well as a negative regulator of Cdk/Cln, we suggest that a double negative feedback loop between Ime2 and Cdk1/Cln3 promotes a bistable switch from the cell cycle to meiosis. Moreover, our results suggest a regulatory mode switch that ensures robust meiosis as the transcription of the early meiosis-specific genes responds in a graded mode to Ime1 levels, whereas that of the middle and late genes as well as initiation of DNA replication, are regulated in a threshold mode."
https://openalex.org/W1977012822,"Frameshift mutations are particularly deleterious to protein function and play a prominent role in carcinogenesis. Most commonly these mutations involve the insertion or omission of a single nucleotide by a DNA polymerase that slips on a damaged or undamaged template. The mismatch DNA repair pathway can repair these nascent polymerase errors. However, overexpression of enzymes of the base excision repair (BER) pathway is known to increase the frequency of frameshift mutations suggesting competition between these pathways. We have examined the fate of DNA containing single nucleotide bulges in human cell extracts and discovered that several deaminated or alkylated nucleotides are efficiently removed by BER. Because single nucleotide bulges are more highly exposed we anticipate that they would be highly susceptible to spontaneous DNA damage. As a model for this, we have shown that chloroacetaldehyde reacts more than 18-fold faster with an A-bulge than with a stable A.T base pair to create alkylated DNA adducts that can be removed by alkyladenine DNA glycosylase. Reconstitution of the BER pathway using purified components establishes that bulged DNA is efficiently processed. Single nucleotide deletion is predicted to repair +1 frameshift events, but to make -1 frameshift events permanent. Therefore, these findings suggest an additional factor contributing to the bias toward deletion mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2044559861,"Antigen-specific IFN-gamma producing CD4(+) T cells are the main mediators of protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection both under natural conditions and following vaccination. However these cells are responsible for lung damage and poor vaccine efficacy when not tightly controlled. Discovering new tools to control nonprotective antigen-specific IFN-gamma production without affecting protective IFN-gamma is a challenge in tuberculosis research.Immunization with DNA encoding Ag85B, a candidate vaccine antigen of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, elicited in mice a low but protective CD4(+) T cell-mediated IFN-gamma response, while in mice primed with DNA and boosted with Ag85B protein a massive increase in IFN-gamma response was associated with loss of protection. Both protective and non-protective Ag85B-immunization generated antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells which suppressed IFN-gamma-secreting CD4(+) T cells. However, ex vivo ligation of 4-1BB, a member of TNF-receptor super-family, reduced the massive, non-protective IFN-gamma responses by CD4(+) T cells in protein-boosted mice without affecting the low protective IFN-gamma-secretion in mice immunized with DNA. This selective inhibition was due to the induction of 4-1BB exclusively on CD8(+) T cells of DNA-primed and protein-boosted mice following Ag85B protein stimulation. The 4-1BB-mediated IFN-gamma inhibition did not require soluble IL-10, TGF-beta, XCL-1 and MIP-1beta. In vivo Ag85B stimulation induced 4-1BB expression on CD8(+) T cells and in vivo 4-1BB ligation reduced the activation, IFN-gamma production and expansion of Ag85B-specific CD4(+) T cells of DNA-primed and protein-boosted mice.Antigen-specific suppressor CD8(+) T cells are elicited through immunization with the mycobacterial antigen Ag85B. Ligation of 4-1BB receptor further enhanced their suppressive activity on IFN-gamma-secreting CD4(+) T cells. The selective expression of 4-1BB only on CD8(+) T cells in mice developing a massive, non-protective IFN-gamma response opens novel strategies for intervention in tuberculosis pathology and vaccination through T-cell co-stimulatory-based molecular targeting."
https://openalex.org/W2153844564,"Background HIV-1 genotypic drug resistance is an important threat to the success of antiretroviral therapy and transmitted resistance has reached 9% prevalence in Europe. Studies have demonstrated that HIV-1 DNA load in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) have a predictive value for disease progression, independently of CD4 counts and plasma viral load. Methodology/Principal Findings Molecular-beacon-based real-time PCR was used to measure HIV-1 second template switch (STS) DNA in PBMC in newly-diagnosed HIV-1 patients across Europe. These patients were representative for the HIV-1 epidemic in the participating countries and were carrying either drug-resistant or sensitive viral strains. The assay design was improved from a previous version to specifically detect M-group HIV-1 and human CCR5 alleles. The findings resulted in a median of 3.32 log10 HIV-1 copies/106 PBMC and demonstrated for the first time no correlation between cellular HIV-1 DNA load and transmitted drug-resistance. A weak association between cellular HIV-1 DNA levels with plasma viral RNA load and CD4+ T-cell counts was also reconfirmed. Co-receptor tropism for 91% of samples, whether or not they conferred resistance, was CCR5. A comparison of pol sequences derived from RNA and DNA, resulted in a high similarity between the two. Conclusions/Significance An improved molecular-beacon-based real-time PCR assay is reported for the measurement of HIV-1 DNA in PBMC and has investigated the association between cellular HIV-1 DNA levels and transmitted resistance to antiretroviral therapy in newly-diagnosed patients from across Europe. The findings show no correlation between these two parameters, suggesting that transmitted resistance does not impact disease progression in HIV-1 infected individuals. The CCR5 co-receptor tropism predominance implies that both resistant and non-resistant strains behave similarly in early infection. Furthermore, a correlation found between RNA- and DNA-derived sequences in the pol region suggests that genotypic drug-resistance testing could be carried out on either template."
https://openalex.org/W1968283612,"In its early stages, the visual system suffers from a lot of ambiguity and noise that severely limits the performance of early vision algorithms. This article presents feedback mechanisms between early visual processes, such as perceptual grouping, stereopsis and depth reconstruction, that allow the system to reduce this ambiguity and improve early representation of visual information. In the first part, the article proposes a local perceptual grouping algorithm that - in addition to commonly used geometric information - makes use of a novel multi-modal measure between local edge/line features. The grouping information is then used to: 1) disambiguate stereopsis by enforcing that stereo matches preserve groups; and 2) correct the reconstruction error due to the image pixel sampling using a linear interpolation over the groups. The integration of mutual feedback between early vision processes is shown to reduce considerably ambiguity and noise without the need for global constraints."
https://openalex.org/W2014111342,"Several recent studies have examined the function and evolution of a Drosophila homolog to the human breast cancer susceptibility gene BRCA2, named dmbrca2. We previously identified what appeared to be a recent expansion in the RAD51-binding BRC-repeat array in the ancestor of Drosophila yakuba. In this study, we examine patterns of variation and evolution of the dmbrca2 BRC-repeat array within D. yakuba and its close relatives. We develop a model of how unequal crossing over may have produced the expanded form, but we also observe short repeat forms, typical of other species in the D. melanogaster group, segregating within D. yakuba and D. santomea. These short forms do not appear to be identical-by-descent, suggesting that the history of dmbrca2 in the D. melanogaster subgroup has involved repeat unit contractions resulting in homoplasious forms. We conclude that the evolutionary history of dmbrca2 in D. yakuba and perhaps in other Drosophila species may be more complicated than can be inferred from examination of the published single genome sequences per species."
https://openalex.org/W2089873946,"We have previously demonstrated that subsets of Ssn6/Tup target genes have distinct requirements for the Schizosaccharomyces pombe homologs of the Tup1/Groucho/TLE co-repressor proteins, Tup11 and Tup12. The very high level of divergence in the histone interacting repression domains of the two proteins suggested that determinants distinguishing Tup11 and Tup12 might be located in this domain. Here we have combined phylogenetic and structural analysis as well as phenotypic characterization, under stress conditions that specifically require Tup12, to identify and characterize the domains involved in Tup12-specific action. The results indicate that divergence in the repression domain is not generally relevant for Tup12-specific function. Instead, we show that the more highly conserved C-terminal WD40 repeat domain of Tup12 is important for Tup12-specific function. Surface amino acid residues specific for the WD40 repeat domain of Tup12 proteins in different fission yeasts are clustered in blade 3 of the propeller-like structure that is characteristic of WD40 repeat domains. The Tup11 and Tup12 proteins in fission yeasts thus provide an excellent model system for studying the functional divergence of WD40 repeat domains."
https://openalex.org/W2028497152,"Decoding transcriptional programs governing transcriptomic diversity across human multiple tissues is a major challenge in bioinformatics. To address this problem, a number of computational methods have focused on cis-regulatory codes driving overexpression or underexpression in a single tissue as compared to others. On the other hand, we recently proposed a different approach to mine cis-regulatory codes: starting from gene sets sharing common cis-regulatory motifs, the method screens for expression modules based on expression coherence. However, both approaches seem to be insufficient to capture transcriptional programs that control gene expression in a subset of all samples. Especially, this limitation would be serious when analyzing multiple tissue data. To overcome this limitation, we developed a new module discovery method termed BEEM (Biclusering-based Extraction of Expression Modules) in order to discover expression modules that are functional in a subset of tissues. We showed that, when applied to expression profiles of human multiple tissues, BEEM finds expression modules missed by two existing approaches that are based on the coherent expression and the single tissue-specific differential expression. From the BEEM results, we obtained new insights into transcriptional programs controlling transcriptomic diversity across various types of tissues. This study introduces BEEM as a powerful tool for decoding regulatory programs from a compendium of gene expression profiles."
