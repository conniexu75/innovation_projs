https://openalex.org/W2063617352,"We have isolated and characterized a novel iron-regulated gene that is homologous to the divalent metal transporter 1 family of metal transporters. This gene, termed metal transporter protein (mtp1), is expressed in tissues involved in body iron homeostasis including the developing and mature reticuloendothelial system, the duodenum, and the pregnant uterus. MTP1 is also expressed in muscle and central nervous system cells in the embryo. At the subcellular level, MTP1 is localized to the basolateral membrane of the duodenal epithelial cell and a cytoplasmic compartment of reticuloendothelial system cells. Overexpression of MTP1 in tissue culture cells results in intracellular iron depletion. In the adult mouse, MTP1 expression in the liver and duodenum are reciprocally regulated. Iron deficiency induces MTP1 expression in the duodenum but down-regulates expression in the liver. These data indicate that MTP1 is an iron-regulated membrane-spanning protein that is involved in intracellular iron metabolism."

Genes known to be involved in this process include tatA, tatB, and tatC that form an operon with a fourth gene, tatD. ThetatD gene product has two homologues in E. colicoded by the unlinked ycfH and yjjV genes. AnE. coli strain with in-frame chromosomal deletions in all three of tatD, ycfH, and yjjVexhibits no significant defect in the cellular location of five cofactor-containing enzymes that are synthesized with twin arginine signal peptides. Neither these mutations nor overproduction of the TatD protein cause any discernible effect on the export kinetics of an additional E. coli Tat pathway substrate. It is concluded that proteins of the TatD family have no obligate involvement in protein export by the Tat system. TatD is shown to be a cytoplasmic protein. TatD binds to immobilized Ni2+ or Zn2+affinity columns and exhibits magnesium-dependent DNase activity. Features of the tatA operon that may control TatD expression are discussed.

Epidemiological studies have demonstrated an up to 6-fold increased risk of developing adenocarcinoma in patients infected with H. pylori. (4.Parsonnet J. Friedman G.D. Vanderstetten D.P. Chang Y.

Therefore, in 1994, H. pylori was classified as a type I carcinogen for humans by the IARC/WHO (7.International Agency for Research on CancerIARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans. Lyon, France, IARC1994Google Scholar). Using an animal model, it has recently been demonstrated directly that long term infection with H. pylori induces gastric adenocarcinoma (8.Watanabe T. Tada M. Nagai H. Sasaki S. Nakao M. Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 642-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar, 9.Honda S. Fujioka T. Tokieda M. Satoh R. Nishizono A. Nasu M.

Moreover, the topographic location and the histology of these tumors were similar to those observed in humans (8.Watanabe T. Tada M. Nagai H. Sasaki S. Nakao M. Gastroenterology. 1998; 115: 642-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which the bacterium causes neoplastic transformation remains unknown. Several studies have demonstrated thatH. pylori stimulates gastric epithelial cell proliferation (11.Peek R.M. Moss S.F. Tham K.T. Perez-Perez G.I. Wang S. Miller G.G. Atherton J.C. Holt P.R. Blaser M.J. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1997; 89: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 12.Bechi P. Balzi M. Becciolini A. Maugeri A. Raggi C.C. Amarosi A. Dei R. Am. J.

Ther. 1994; 8: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that transformation is not mediated directly by H. pylori but rather occurs nonspecifically due to increased mutations following rapid cell proliferation. H. pylori infection can cause a broad range of diseases. Although most infected individuals only develop a superficial gastritis, some patients progress to chronic gastritis, duodenal ulceration, or, rarely, cancer (14.Nomura A. Stemmermann G.N. Chyou P. Perez-Perez G.I. Blaser M.J. Ann. Intern. Med. 1994; 120: 977-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 15.Blaser M.J. J. Infect. Dis. 1990; 161: 626-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). This variability in clinical manifestation may arise because individual H. pylori strains differ in virulence. Several virulence factors have been described and include the presence of a vacuolating cytotoxin, VacA, and a cytotoxin-associated antigen A, CagA (16.Phadnis S.H. Ilver D. Janzon L. Normark S. Westblom T.U. Infect. Immun. 1994; 62: 1557-1565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Covacci A. Censini S. Bugnoli M. Petracca R. Burroni D. Macchia G. Massone A. Papini E. Xiang Z. Figura N. Rappuoli R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5791-5795Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). Various studies have reported an increased risk of developing distal gastric cancer for patients infected with CagA-positive strains compared with cagA-negative individuals (18.Blaser M.J.

In order to study H. pylori pathogenesis in vitro, the bacterium was co-cultured with gastric epithelial cell lines. In this model, H. pylori induces secretion of the chemokine IL-81 (21.Crabtree J.E. Farmery S.M. Lindley I.J.D. Figura N. Peichl P. Tompkins D.S. J. Clin.

These data confirm the observation that mucosal biopsies from patients with H. pylori infections contain significantly elevated levels of IL-8, compared with specimens from uninfected individuals (23.Gionchetti P. Vaira D. Campieri M. Holton J. Menegatti M. Belluzzi A. Bertinelli E. Ferretti M. Brignola C. Migliolo M. Barbara L. Am. J. Gastroent. 1994; 89: 883-887PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Peek R.M. Miller G.G.

Primrose J.N. Lindley I.J.D. J. Clin. Pathol. 1994; 47: 61-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). In vitro, CagA-positive strains elicit a significantly higher IL-8 response than CagA-negative strains (21.Crabtree J.E. Farmery S.M. Lindley I.J.D. Figura N. Peichl P. Tompkins D.S. J. Clin. Pathol. 1994; 47: 945-950Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 24.Peek R.M. Miller G.G. Tham K.T. Perez-Perez G.I. Zhao X. Atherton J.C. Blaser M.J. Lab.

However, isogenic mutants, altered only in the cagAgene, induce as much IL-8 production as the parental strain (27.Crabtree J.E. Xiang Z. Lindley I.J.D. Tompkins D.S. Rappuoli R. Covacci A. J. Clin. Pathol. 1995; 48: 967-969Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Therefore, although cagA represents a marker of enhanced pathogenicity, the protein itself is not required. The recent identification of a H. pylori “pathogenicity island” represents a major advance in our understanding of bacterial pathogenesis (28.Censini S. Lange C. Xiang Z. Crabtree J.E. Ghiara P. Borodovsky M. Rappuoli R. Covacci A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14648-14653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar). The pathogenicity island, a 40-kilobase segment of DNA, harbors over 40 genes that encode pathogenicity factors, includingcagA (28.Censini S. Lange C. Xiang Z. Crabtree J.E. Ghiara P. Borodovsky M. Rappuoli R. Covacci A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14648-14653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar). Isogenic mutants, altered in one of sixcag genes (cagE, cagG, cagH, cagI, cagL, andcagM) fail to elicit IL-8 secretion from gastric epithelial cells (29.Segal E.D. Lange C. Covacci A. Tompkins L.S. Falkow S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7595-7599Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These Cag proteins show similarity to bacterial secretion systems, particularly the type IV secretion system described inBordetella pertussis (30.Winans S.C. Burns D.L. Christie P.J. Trends Microbiol. 1996; 4: 64-68Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It has therefore been proposed that these Cag proteins form a membrane associated complex on theH. pylori surface, possibly functioning as a secretion system (31.Covacci A. Falkow S. Berg D.E. Rappuoli R. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 205-208Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The AP-1 family of transcription factors plays a pivotal role in cell proliferation and neoplastic transformation (32.Angel P. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1072: 129-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (3237) Google Scholar). AP-1 complexes consist of homo- and heterodimers of the proto-oncogene families Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2), Jun (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD), and ATF (ATF2, ATF3/LRF1, and B-ATF), all members of the bZIP (basic region leucine zipper) family of DNA-binding proteins. The proteins are inactive in quiescent cells but are rapidly activated by a variety of extracellular stimuli, including growth factors, cytokines, and cellular stress signals (33.Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar, 34.Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). The transforming counterparts of these cellular proteins, the activated oncogenes v-fos and v-jun, are transduced by the FBJ and FBR murine osteogenic sarcoma viruses (35.Curran T. Teich N.M. Virology. 1982; 116: 221-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 36.Curran T. Teich N.M. J. Virol. 1982; 42: 114-122Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, aberrant, deregulated expression or overexpression of the cellular Fos and Jun proteins also causes neoplastic transformation (37.Curran T. Miller A.D. Zukas L. Verma I.M. Cell. 1984; 36: 259-268Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 38.Miller A.D. Curran T. Verma I.M. Cell. 1984; 36: 51-60Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar).

Cell. 1995; 82: 721-732Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) have shown that c-Fos is required for the malignant progression of skin tumors. c-Fos has been called a “master switch” of cell proliferation and differentiation. Treatment of cultured fibroblasts with c-fosantisense RNA or micro-injection of anti-c-Fos antibodies inhibits cell proliferation (41.Raibowol K.T. Vosatka R.J. Ziff E.B. Lamb N.J. Feramisco J.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1670-1676Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 42.Holt J.T. Venkat Gopal T. Moulton A.D. Nienhuis A.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4794-4798Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The generation of c-jun–/– knockout mice has demonstrated an absolute requirement of c-Jun for the proliferation of fibroblasts, as cells isolated from c-jun–/– mice are defective in proliferation (43.Johnson R.S. Van Lingen B. Papaioannou V.E. Spiegelmann B.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1309-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Because of their central role in controlling proliferation, the expression and activity of Fos and Jun proteins is tightly controlled. Much of this control is exerted by three related kinase cascades collectively called MAP kinase cascades (see Fig. 11) (34.Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar, 44.Minden A. Karin M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1333: F85-F194PubMed Google Scholar). These signal transduction pathways consist of three levels of interacting kinases: a MAP kinase kinase kinase phosphorylates a MAP kinase kinase, which in turn phosphorylates a MAP kinase. The MAP kinase, finally, transduces to the nucleus, where it phosphorylates a transcription factor, thereby activating it. Three distinct but interacting MAP kinase pathways have been described in detail: the ERK1/2 pathway, the SAP kinase/JNK pathway, and the p38 pathway (see Fig. 11) (reviewed in Ref. 34.Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). A variety of extracellular signals induce MAP kinase activity, but individual stimuli may selectively activate one of the other pathways. The ERK1/2 pathway is the main effector of growth factor receptor signaling. AP-1 activity is regulated by all three MAP kinase pathways mentioned (34.Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). Regulation occurs both at the transcriptional level and at the posttranscriptional level. Expression of c-fos, which is nearly absent in quiescent cells, is controlled at the level of transcription. All three MAP kinases, ERK1/2, SAPK/JNK and p38, can phosphorylate the transcription factor Elk-1, a member of the ternary complex family (45.Zinck R. Cahill M.A. Kracht M. Sachsenmaier C. Hipskind R.A. Nordheim A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4930-4938Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 46.Rinegaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T. Derijard B. Davis R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1247-1255Crossref PubMed Scopus (1137) Google Scholar). Elk-1 binds the serum response element motif in the c-fos promoter, thereby inducing c-fostranscription (47.Hipskind R.A. Rao V.N. Mueller C.G. Reddy E.S.P. Nordheim A. Nature. 1991; 354: 531-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). In contrast, c-jun is regulated both transcriptionally and posttranscriptionally. A few c-Jun homodimers preexist in resting cells. In addition, c-jun transcription is up-regulated by activated MAP kinases (48.Lamph W.W. Wamsley P. Sassone-Corsi P. Verma I.M. Nature. 1988; 334: 629-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). Subsequently, c-Jun can increase its own transcription by binding to the TRE motif in its promoter (34.Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). Novel c-Fos synthesis leads to the formation of Jun/Fos heterodimers, which have a 10-fold higher DNA binding affinity than Jun/Jun homodimers, resulting in increased AP-1 activity (49.Han T.H. Prywes R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2907-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Posttranscriptionally, c-Jun activity is potentiated through phosphorylation of the transcriptional activator domain by SAPK/JNK (50.Dérijard B. Hibi M. Wu I.-H. Barrett T. Su B. Deng T. Karin M. Davis R.J. Cell. 1994; 76: 1025-1037Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2941) Google Scholar). Because AP-1 plays such a crucial role in cell proliferation and transformation and H. pylori induces a hyperproliferation of gastric epithelial cells and sometimes neoplasia, we investigated whether H. pylori is able to induce AP-1 activity in gastric epithelial cells. We show here that exposure of gastric epithelial cells to various H. pylori strains strongly induces AP-1 DNA binding. H. pylori selectively activates the ERK/MAP kinase cascade; p38 is not induced. The stimulation of ERK leads to phosphorylation of the transcription factor Elk-1 and markedly increases c-fos transcription. At the protein level, expression of c-Fos and phosphorylation of c-Jun is strongly induced. We show that H. pylori strains that do not express CagA or that are mutated in cag genes encoded by the CagI pathogenicity island do not induce AP-1, MAP kinase activity, c-Fos, or c-Jun expression. Our observations provide a molecular mechanism for the observed stimulation of gastric epithelial cell proliferation during H. pylori infection. Moreover, activation of the proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-jun may represent one crucial step in the development of H. pylori induced gastric neoplasia. AGS cells (ATCC CRL 1739) were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and 50 μg/ml penicillin-streptomycin (all from Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were maintained in the logarithmic growth phase for stimulation experiments. H. pylori strains 151 and 2012 are clinical isolates and have been previously described (51.Apel I. Jacobs E. Kist M. Bredt W. Zbl. Bakt. Hyg. 1988; 268: 271-276PubMed Google Scholar, 52.Odenbreit S. Till M. Haas R. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 20: 361-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Strains NTCT 11638 and ATCC 43405 were isolated from patients with active chronic gastritis and are reference strains (53.Warren J.R. Marshall B. Lancet. 1983; i: 1273-1275Google Scholar). Strain G27, as well as 12 isogenic strains, each mutated in a single gene encoded within the pathogenicity island, have also been described (28.Censini S. Lange C. Xiang Z. Crabtree J.E. Ghiara P. Borodovsky M. Rappuoli R. Covacci A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14648-14653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1633) Google Scholar). Stock cultures were maintained at −70 °C in brucella broth supplemented with 30% glycerol. The strains were cultured in brucella broth supplemented either with 10% fetal calf serum or with 1% cyclodextrin in a microaerobic atmosphere at 37 °C. For co-culture AGS cells were serum deprived for 12 h to reduce serum-induced AP-1 activity. The H. pylori strains were cultured to an A 695 of 1.0 (a density of 108 bacteria per ml) and assayed microscopicaly for viability. Bacterial cultures were washed three times in Ham's F-12 medium and then co-cultured with 106 AGS cells (2 × 105/ml) for 1 h. Cells were washed two times in phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by centrifugation. Protein extracts were prepared as described below. These were subsequently analyzed in electrophoretic mobility shift assays, in Western blots, or in immunoprecipitations. Total cell extracts were prepared using a high salt detergent buffer (Totex) (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 350 mm NaCl, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm Na3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm NaPPi, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% aprotinin). Adherent cells were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline, scraped in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline, harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in 4 cell volumes (50 μl) of Totex buffer. The cell lysate was incubated on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged for 5 min at 13000 × g at 4 °C. The protein content of the supernatant was determined (Bio-Rad), and equal amounts of protein (10–20 μg) added to a reaction mixture containing 20 μg of bovine serum albumin (Sigma), 2 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 2 μl of Buffer D+ (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 20% glycerin, 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), 4 μl of Buffer F (20% Ficoll 400, 100 mm Hepes, 300 mm KCl, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), 5 mmMgCl2 and 100,000 cpm (Cerenkov) of a32P-labeled oligonucleotide (Promega) in a final volume of 20 μl. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 25 min. For the supershift assays, protein extracts were diluted 3-fold, and 2 μl of antibody were added to the reaction simultaneously with the protein and incubated as described above. Anti-c-Fos-all, anti-c-Fos, anti-Fra1, anti-Fra2, anti-c-Jun-all, anti-c-Jun, anti-JunB, and anti-JunD antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The AP-1 oligonucleotide (Promega) was labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Promega). The MAP kinase inhibitors PD 98059 and SB 202190 were purchased from Calbiochem. U0126 was obtained from Promega. Stock solutions of 10 or 20 mm respectively were prepared in Me2SO (DMSO). The inhibitors were added directly to the culture medium at the indicated final concentrations 30 min prior to co-culture. MAP kinase assay kits (New England Biolabs) were used per the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, 200 μg of total cell extracts were incubated with Sepharose A-immobilized anti-phospho-MEK1/2- or anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibodies overnight. Immunocomplexes were collected by centrifugation and washed twice in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mmNaPPi, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4) and then twice in kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4). Kinase assays were performed by resuspending the samples in 50 μl of kinase buffer and incubating them for 30 min at 37 °C with 200 μm ATP and 2 μg of either recombinant ERK-2- or an Elk-1-glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein as a substrate. The reactions were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and the phosphorylated substrates were detected by phospho-specific anti-ERK1/2 or anti-Elk-1 antibodies (New England Biolabs). For the detection of ERK-2 a secondary anti-mouse IgG, which was preadsorbed to multiple species (Dianova), was substituted for the supplied secondary antibody. Total cell extracts (30 μg) were boiled in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were transferred at 0.8 mA/cm2for 1 h onto Immobilon P membranes (Millipore) using a semidry blotting apparatus (Owl). Nonspecific binding sites were blocked by immersing the membrane in blocking solution (TBST (10 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20 (v/v)) containing 5% skim milk powder; the anti-Ekl-1 antibody was incubated in TBST containing 5% bovine serum albumin) overnight at 4 °C. After a short wash in TBST, the membranes were incubated in a 1:1000 dilution of primary antibody (anti-Elk-1 and phospho-specific anti-c-Jun-Ser-73, New England Biolabs; anti-c-Fos, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature, followed by 30 min of washing with TBST. Bound antibody was decorated with peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; diluted 1:1000 in blocking solution) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing for 30 min in TBST, the immunocomplexes were detected using ECL Western blotting reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Exposure to Kodak XAR-5 films was performed for 5–10 s. Total cellular RNA was harvested using an acidic phenol extraction (Trizol, Life Technologies, Inc.).10 μg of RNA were loaded onto a 1% agarose gel cast in 1× MOPS buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 5 mm NaOAc, 1 mmEDTA) containing 0.6% formaldehyde. The RNA was transferred onto a nylon membrane (Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by capillary blotting and fixed by UV cross-linking. The blot was hybridized in ExpressHyb solution (CLONTECH) at 68 °C. A 500-base pair fragment of the c-fos cDNA was labeled using the Prime-It-II labeling kit (Stratagene) and [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The blots were washed three times for 10 min in 2× SSC, 0.05% SDS at room temperature, and twice at 50 °C for 15 min in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS. After the first hybridization, the membrane was reprobed with a 1.2-kilobase pair PstI fragment of the human β-actin gene to control for equal loading of the RNA. In order to investigate whether exposure of gastric epithelial cells to H. pylori activates the transcription factor AP-1, AGS cells were co-cultured with variousH. pylori strains for 1 h. Subsequently, cell extracts were prepared and assayed for AP-1 DNA binding in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Co-culture of AGS cells with severalH. pylori strains caused the appearance of a novel DNA-protein complex (Fig. 1, lanes 2–5), which was subsequently identified as AP-1 by competition assay (Fig. 2, lanes 11 and12). The five strains differed in their ability to induce AP-1 DNA binding: strains ATCC 43405 and G27 strongly induced the transcription factor, strains 151 and NTCT 11638 showed a moderate effect, and strain 2012 did not activate AP-1 (Fig. 1).Figure 2Supershift and competition analysis ofH. pylori-activated AP-1. EMSA supershift and competition assays of total cell extracts from AGS cells co-cultured with H. pylori strain G27. Lane 1, untreated AGS cells; lanes 2–12, AGS cells co-cultured with H. pylori strain G27. Lanes 3–10, extracts were incubated with the antibodies indicated. Lanes 10 and 11,extracts were incubated with a 100-fold excess of the nonradioactive oligonucleotide indicated. The filled arrowhead points to the specific AP-1 complex. The filled circles denote the supershifted complexes. The open circle denotes nonspecific binding to the probe, and the open arrowhead shows unbound oligonucleotide. This experiment was performed three times with similar results.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because the AP-1 complex can consist of various subunits, we wished to determine the composition of H. pylori-induced AP-1. Antibody supershift assays revealed that H. pylori activates a heterodimer composed mainly of c-Fos and c-Jun proteins. An antibody that reacts with all Fos proteins, as well as an antibody that exclusively recognizes c-Fos, supershifted the complex (Fig. 2,lanes 3 and 4). In contrast, antibodies to Fra-1 or Fra-2 had no effect, indicating that these proteins are not present in H. pylori-induced AP-1 (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and6). Similarly, an antibody that recognizes all Jun family members and an antibody directed solely against c-Jun both reacted with the complex (lanes 7 and 8). Antibodies to JunB and JunD showed no effect, again suggesting that these proteins are not contained in this AP-1 complex (lanes 9 and10). We have previously reported that the ability ofH. pylori strain G27 to induce the activity of a different transcription factor, NF-κB, requires the presence of several genes located in the pathogenicity island cagI (54.Glocker E. Lange C. Covacci A. Bereswill S. Kist M. Pahl H.L. Infect. Immun. 1998; 66: 2346-2348Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 55.Münzenmaier A. Lange C. Glocker E. Moran A. Covacci A. Bereswill S. Baeuerle P.A. Kist M. Pahl H.L. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 6140-6147PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the products of these genes form a structure on theH. pylori surface and that this may represent the NF-κB inducing agent. We investigated whether the same gene products are required for AP-1 activation. Twelve isogenic mutants of strain G27, each altered in a single locus within the pathogenicity island, were tested for their ability to induce AP-1."

The cleaved intracellular region (RAMIC) of Notch is translocated into the nucleus and interacts with a DNA-binding protein RBP-J to activate transcription of genes that regulate cell differentiation. Although RAMIC has been shown to facilitate the RBP-J-mediated transactivation by displacing the histone deacetylase corepressor complex from RBP-J, there is no evidence demonstrating the involvement of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) in the transactivation. Here we show that mouse Notch1 RAMIC interacts with two conserved HATs, mouse PCAF and GCN5, and recruits each of the HATs to RBP-J. The ankyrin repeats and the transactivation domain of RAMIC and the N-terminal regions of PCAF and GCN5, respectively, are required for the interaction. We also show that not only mouse Notch1 but alsoDrosophila Notch RAMIC interacts with mouse PCAF and GCN5 in mammalian cells. Furthermore, the RBP-J-mediated transactivation activity of RAMIC is repressed by two HAT inhibitor proteins, E1A and Twist.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3728-3740Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), the amino acid sequences in the corresponding regions of the two species are not homologous. RBP-J is known to associate with the viral protein Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen 2 (EBNA2) which is essential for the immortalization of human primary B lymphocytes (10.Honjo T. Genes to Cells. 1996; 1: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). EBNA2 has an acidic TAD similar to the TAD of the virus protein VP16 (25.Cohen J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8030-8034Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and binds to RBP-J to activate transcription from the EBV promoter through the EBNA2-responsive element (EBNA2RE) carrying canonical RBP-J-binding sites (26.Zimber-Strobl U. Strobl L.J. Meitinger C. Hinrichs R. Sakai T. Furukawa T. Honjo T. Bornkamm G.W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4973-4982Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 27.Henkel T. Ling P.D. Hayward S.D. Peterson M.G. Science. 1994; 265: 92-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Since the EBV promoter and the HES-1 promoter are stimulated by either RAMIC or EBNA2, respectively (18.Kato H.

Fukuhara T. Strobl L.J. Zimber-Strobl U. Bornkamm G.W. Honjo T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 6034-6039Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it is expected that the cellular (RAMIC) and viral (EBNA2) proteins activate transcription from a similar set of promoters by a common mechanism. Evidently, provision of the TAD is at least one mechanism of the RBP-J-mediated transactivation. In addition, several lines of evidence have suggested that RBP-J is associated with a putative corepressor(s) and that RAMIC and EBNA2 displace the corepressor(s) from RBP-J to facilitate the transactivation (18.Kato H.

It has been demonstrated that hypoacetylated histones accumulate within transcriptionally silenced genes, while hyperacetylated histones accumulate within transcriptionally active genes (30.Wade P.A.

Cell. 1999; 98: 285-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). In fact, many transcriptional repressors and corepressors have been shown to associate with histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity that generates a repressed chromatin structure with decreased accessibility to the transcription machinery (31.Kornberg R.D. Lorch Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 285-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar, 32.Kouzarides T. Curr. Opin. Genet.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2269-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) demonstrated that RBP-J interacts with a corepressor complex including the SMRT/NCoR family of nuclear receptor corepressors and histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) (34.Xu L. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1999; 9: 140-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar). They showed that SMRT/NCoR competed with TAN-1 (human Notch1 RAMIC) for RBP-J-binding and antagonized the RBP-J-mediated transactivation activity of TAN-1. It was also shown that the RBP-J/CBF1-interacting corepressor, CIR can interact with the similar HDAC complex including HDAC2 and SAP30 (35.Hsieh J.J.-D. Zhou S. Chen L. Young D.B. Hayward S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). On the other hand, a number of transcriptional activators have been shown to associate with histone acetyltransferases (HATs) such as the global coactivator P300/CBP (36.Ogryzko V.V. Schiltz R.L. Russanova V. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Cell. 1996; 87: 953-959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2338) Google Scholar) and the prototype HAT PCAF, which was originally isolated in human as a P300/CBP-associated factor by virtue of its sequence similarity to yeast GCN5 (37.Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). Here we describe the functional interaction between mouse Notch1 RAMIC and two conserved HATs, mouse PCAF and GCN5 (38.Xu W. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5659-5669Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We show that the interaction is conserved across species and RAMIC can recruit each of the HATs to RBP-J. Furthermore, we show that the RBP-J-mediated transactivation activity of RAMIC is repressed by two HAT inhibitor proteins, E1A and Twist, which are structurally unrelated to each other. Our results suggest that HATs including PCAF and GCN5 may be involved in the RBP-J-mediated transactivation by Notch RAMIC. A luciferase reporter plasmid pGa981-6 contains the hexamerized 50-base pair EBNA2RE of the EBV TP-1 promoter in front of the minimal β-globin promoter of pGa50-7 (18.Kato H. Taniguchi Y. Kurooka H.

For the generation of pCMX-VP16-RAMIC deletion constructs, various regions of mouse Notch1 RAMIC derived from pBluescript II KS(−) (Stratagene)-RAMIC-(1747–2531), pCS2+6MT-mNotchIC-(1810–2531) (17.Kopan R.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5448-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) were digested with appropriate restriction enzymes and subcloned into the pCMX-VP16 vector (23.Kurooka H. Kuroda K. Honjo T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5448-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), in-frame to the C terminus of the VP16 TAD. To target VP16 fusion proteins lacking the intrinsic NLSs of RAMIC into the nucleus, pCMX-VP16 harboring the NLS of the SV40 large T antigen (pCMX-VP16-NLS, Ref. 40.Agata Y. Matsuda E. Shimizu A. J. Biol.

To generate pFlag-CMV2-PCAF and -GCN5, theBamHI-KpnI fragment of pRSETB-mPCAF (38.Xu W. Edmondson D.G. Roth S.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5659-5669Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and theKpnI (blunted)-SalI fragment of pRSETB-mGCN5 were subcloned into the BglII/KpnI sites and theEcoRV/SalI sites of pFlag-CMV2 vector (Eastman Kodak), respectively. pCMX-VP16-PCAF and -GCN5 were constructed by inserting the NotI (blunted)-BamHI fragment of pFlag-CMV2-PCAF and the EcoRI-SalI fragment of pFlag-CMV2-GCN5, into the EcoRV/BamHI sites and the EcoRI/SalI sites of pCMX-VP16, respectively. The yeast GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) fusion vector, pCMX-GAL4, was constructed in two steps. The HindIII-PstI fragment containing the GAL4 TAD of pGAD424 was replaced by theHindIII-PstI fragment containing the GAL4 DBD of pGBT9 (CLONTECH), and the insert containing the GAL4 DBD and the multiple restriction enzyme sites was excised withHindIII. Then, the HindIII fragment of pCMX-VP16 containing the VP16 TAD was replaced by the excised insert. TheNotI (blunted)-BamHI fragment of pFlag-CMV2-PCAF and the KpnI (blunted)-SalI fragment of pRSETB-mGCN5 were subcloned into the SmaI/BamHI sites and the SmaI/SalI sites of pCMX-GAL4 in-frame to the C terminus of the GAL4 DBD, respectively, resulting in pCMX-GAL4-PCAF and -GAL4-GCN5. Deletion constructs of GAL4-PCAF and GAL4-GCN5 were generated by excising the inserts from pFlag-CMV2-PCAF, the full-length pCMX-GAL4-PCAF, or the full-length pCMX-GAL4-GCN5 with appropriate restriction enzymes and subcloning them into pCMX-GAL4. Two fragments of PCAF (1–192 and 193–424) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pGEM-T vector-Easy (Promega). After the sequences of the cloned fragments were confirmed on both strands, they were subcloned into pCMX-GAL4. The StuI-SnaBI fragment of pCS2+6MT-mNotchIC was replaced by the blunt endedHindIII-BamHI fragment derived from pFlag-CMV2-PCAF, resulting in pCS2+6MT-PCAF. pCMX-E1A was constructed by subcloning theHindIII-BglII fragment excised from pBJ9ΩAd5-E1A12S (41.Reid J.L. Bannister A.J. Zegerman P. Martinez-Balbas M.A. Kouzarides T. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4469-4477Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) into the HindIII/BamHI sites of pCMX. The coding region of mouse Twist was obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification with specific primers, 5′-ATGATGCAGGACGTGTCCAGCTCG-3′ (forward) and 5′-TGCTAGTGGGACGCGGACATGGAC-3′ (reverse), using AKR mouse genomic DNA as template. The amplified fragment was cloned into pGEM-T vector-Easy and the sequence of both strands was confirmed. TheEcoRI-FspI and FspI-SalI fragments were excised from the plasmid, and the two fragments were simultaneously ligated to the EcoRI/SalI sites of pFlag-CMV2, resulting in pFlag-CMV2-Twist. SV40 transformed monkey kidney COS7 cells, human embryonic kidney 293T cells, and murine fibroblast NIH3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Murine myoblast C2C12 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum. The C2C12-derived cell line L9, which contains the pGa981-6 reporter construct with the blasticidin S resistance gene, was maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum and 10 μg/ml blasticidin S (Kaken Seiyaku). COS7, L9, and NIH3T3 cells were seeded on 6-well plates at 2 × 105 cells per well 18 h before transfection and transiently transfected with various combinations of expression plasmid DNA indicated in each figure legend, using LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). The total amount of plasmid DNAs was kept constant (1–2 μg) by adding the same expression plasmids without inserts. Transfected cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and luciferase activities were measured according to the manufacturer's instructions (TOYO INK) in a Berthold luminometer, LumatLB9501. Ethanol or 0–100 ng/ml trichostatin A (Sigma) was added to the culture medium at 24 h before harvesting. In all the experiments, the relative luciferase activity was normalized to the β-galactosidase activity obtained by transfection with 50 ng of pCMX-LacZ. Each experiment was repeated more than two times and the representative results are shown as the average of triplicate values with standard deviations. Anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (mAb), 9E10 was prepared from hybridoma. Anti-Flag mAb, M2 was purchased from Eastman Kodak. Anti-E1A mAb, M73, and anti-GAL4 DBD mAb, RK5C1, were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-VP16 polyclonal antibody was purchased from CLONTECH. Anti-PCAF polyclonal antibody was provided by Y. Nakatani (37.Yang X.-J. Ogryzko V.V. Nishikawa J. Howard B.H. Nakatani Y. Nature. 1996; 382: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). As secondary antibodies, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Southern Biotechnology) and anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) were used. For Western analysis, whole cell lysates of transfected NIH3T3 cells or nuclear extracts of transfected COS7 cells were mixed with SDS sample buffer, boiled for 5 min, and separated by SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose filter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) by Semi-Dry (Bio-Rad). After blocking with phosphate-buffered saline containing 2% skim milk, the filter was incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h at room temperature, washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20, and incubated with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL Plus detection system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For immunoprecipitation, 293T cells seeded on 6-cm dishes at 5 × 105 cells per plate 18 h prior to transfection were transiently transfected using the CellPhect transfection kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After 40 h of incubation, cells were washed, scraped in phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed in IP buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 150 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A). After the cell lysates were rotated for 30 min at 4 °C, the cell debris was removed by centrifugation and the supernatant was used as whole cell extract. The whole cell extracts were incubated with anti-Flag M2-affinity gel (Sigma) by rotating for 3 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with ice-cold IP buffer. Bound proteins were eluted in SDS sample buffer and subjected to Western blot analysis. Preparation of nuclear extracts from COS7 cells and EMSA for GAL4 fusion proteins were performed as described previously (23.Kurooka H. Kuroda K. Honjo T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5448-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The binding reaction contained 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 μmZnSO4, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 μg poly(dI-dC), 0.5 ng of 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe MH100, and 4 μg of nuclear extracts. The reaction mixture in a final volume of 30 μl was incubated for 30 min at 20 °C and loaded onto a native 4% polyacrylamide gel in a buffer (pH 7.5) containing 6.7 mm Tris, 3.3 mm NaOAc, and 1 mmEDTA. After electrophoresis at 130 V for 2.5 h at 4 °C, the gels were dried and analyzed using an Imaging Analyzer BAS1500 (Fuji Film). Previously we reported that the fusion protein between RBP-J and the C-terminal portion of mouse Notch1 RAMIC (RBP-J-ICΔANK, Fig.1) failed to activate transcription of the pGa981-6 luciferase reporter gene carrying 12 canonical RBP-J-binding sites (23.Kurooka H. Kuroda K. Honjo T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5448-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), although the C terminus of mouse Notch1 activates transcription autonomously when fused to the yeast GAL4 DBD (Ref. 23.Kurooka H. Kuroda K. Honjo T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5448-5455Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar and see Fig. 5). We also showed that the repressed transactivation activity of the fusion protein was relieved by coexpression of either the RAM domain or the ANK repeats of RAMIC, suggesting that a putative corepressor(s) would associate with the RBP-J-ICΔANK fusion protein and might be displaced by the coexpressed RBP-J-binding domains. Since RBP-J interacts with HDAC corepressor complexes (33.Kao H.-Y. Ordentlich P. Koyano-Nakagawa N. Tang Z. Downes M. Kintner C.R. Evans R.M. Kadesch T. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2269-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar, 35.Hsieh J.J.-D. Zhou S. Chen L. Young D.B. Hayward S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 23-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), we asked whether the fusion protein between RBP-J and the C-terminal portion of mouse Notch1 RAMIC is repressed by the HDAC activity. The reporter plasmid pGa981-6 or pGa50-7 (without RBP-J-binding sites) was transfected into COS7 cells with the plasmid encoding RBP-J or RBP-J-ICΔANK, and the cells were treated with increasing concentrations (0–100 ng/ml) of a histone deacetylase-specific inhibitor, trichostatin A (TSA; Ref. 42.Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription of pGa981-6 was activated by TSA in a dose-dependent manner (7-fold with 100 ng/ml TSA) when RBP-J-ICΔANK, but not when the non-chimeric RBP-J, was transfected (Fig.2 A). This activation was dependent on the presence of RBP-J-binding sites as well as on the fused C terminus of RAMIC, arguing against the general effect of TSA on transcription. Next we investigated whether the effect of TSA was restricted to episomal DNA or it was also applicable to chromosomally integrated DNA. As shown in Fig. 2 B, transcription was markedly activated by TSA (45-fold with 100 ng/ml TSA) when RBP-J-ICΔANK was transiently transfected into L9, a line of mouse myoblast C2C12 cells that was established by stable transfection with the pGa981-6 reporter. When RBP-J alone was transfected into L9, weak transactivation was observed by high concentration of TSA (2.7-fold with 100 ng/ml). Thus, inhibition of HDAC activity results in derepression of the transactivation activity of the fusion protein, either with the transient"

The nuclear hormone receptors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and liver X receptor (LXR) play key roles in regulation of hepatic lipid metabolism. Because heterodimerization with RXR is crucial for their action, we hypothesized that a decrease in RXR may be one mechanism to coordinately down-regulate gene expression during APR. We demonstrate that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induces a rapid, dose-dependent decrease in RXRα, RXRβ, and RXRγ proteins in hamster liver. Maximum inhibition was observed at 4 h for RXRα (62%) and RXRβ (50%) and at 2 h for RXRγ (61%). These decreases were associated with a marked reduction in RXRα, RXRβ, and RXRγ mRNA levels. Increased RNA degradation is likely responsible for the repression of RXR, because LPS did not decreaseRXRβ and RXRγ transcription and only marginally inhibited (38%) RXRα transcription. RXR repression was associated with decreased LXRα and PPARα mRNA levels and reduced RXR·RXR, RXR·PPAR and RXR·LXR binding activities in nuclear extracts. Furthermore, LPS markedly decreased both basal and Wy-14,643-induced expression of acyl-CoA synthetase, a well characterized PPARα target.

The nuclear receptor superfamily has been divided into four major subgroups according to their dimerization and DNA binding properties (3.Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar). Class II receptors consist of nuclear receptors that heterodimerize with the retinoid X receptor (RXR)1 and usually bind to direct repeats separated by a variable number of spacer nucleotides (3.Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2805) Google Scholar,4.Kliewer S.A. Umesono K. Noonan D.J. Heyman R.A. Evans R.M. Nature. 1992; 358: 771-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (1510) Google Scholar). The class II subgroup includes the retinoic acid receptor (RAR), thyroid hormone receptor, vitamin D receptor, farnesoid X receptor, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), and liver X receptor (LXR) (3.Mangelsdorf D.J.

RXRα is strongly expressed in liver, kidney, muscle, lung, and spleen (6.Leid M. Kastner P. Lyons R. Nakshatri H. Saunders M. Zacharewski T. Chen J.Y. Staub A. Garnier J.M. Mader S. Chambon P.

RXRβ is expressed ubiquitously, and it is present at low level in liver, intestine, and testis (6.Leid M. Kastner P. Lyons R. Nakshatri H. Saunders M. Zacharewski T. Chen J.Y. Staub A. Garnier J.M.

To date, the 9-cis retinoic acid isomer has been identified as the most potent endogenous ligand for RXR (8.Heyman R.A. Mangelsdorf D.J. Dyck J.A. Stein R.B. Eichele G. Evans R.M. Thaller C. Cell. 1992; 68: 397-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1549) Google Scholar). The acute phase response (APR), which is induced during infection, inflammation, and injury, is associated with numerous changes in lipid metabolism (9.Hardardottir I. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Hypertriglyceridemia, decreased high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, accelerated lipolysis, decreased hepatic fatty acid (FA) oxidation, and inhibition of the synthesis of bile acids are some of the alterations in lipid metabolism that occur during the APR (9.Hardardottir I. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In most instances, these changes are mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) or interleukin (IL)-1 and are due to alterations in gene transcription (9.Hardardottir I. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these alterations in gene transcription that account for the changes in lipid metabolism during the APR remain to be identified. Both PPAR and LXR have been implicated in the regulation of genes important in lipid metabolism. PPARα activation in the liver stimulates FA metabolism and transport, and LXR activation leads to an increase in bile acid synthesis. Specifically, PPARα increases the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase, acyl-CoA oxidase, acyl-CoA synthetase (ACS), cytochrome P450 4A enzymes, FA transport protein, and FA-binding protein (10.Dreyer C.

Furthermore, LXR stimulates the expression of 7α-hydroxylase gene (CYP7A), the rate-limiting enzyme for conversion of cholesterol to bile acids (18.Lehmann J.M. Kliewer S.A. Moore L.B.

Ther. 1999; 290: 1250-1257PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the expression or activity of each of these proteins involved in lipid metabolism in the liver is rapidly and markedly decreased following induction of the APR by LPS or cytokine administration. One potential mechanism by which the expression of many genes could be coordinately decreased during the APR is by the reduction of the levels of specific transcription factors. Because heterodimerization with RXR is crucial for the action of several nuclear hormone receptors including PPAR and LXR, we hypothesized that a decrease in RXR levels in the liver may occur during APR. Previous studies by Sugawaraet al. (27.Sugawara A. Uruno A. Nagata T. Taketo M.M. Takeuchi K. Ito S. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3030-3033Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) showed that TNF decreases the expression of aRXRβ promoter construct in rat GH3 cells. Here we report that RXRα, RXRβ, and RXRγ proteins and mRNA levels decline during the APR in hamster. RXR repression is associated with LXRα and PPARα repression, resulting in an overall decreased ability of RXR·RXR homodimers, RXR·PPAR, and RXR·LXR heterodimers to bind to their respective response elements. LPS (Escherichia coli 55:B5) was obtained from Difco Laboratories and freshly diluted to desired concentration in pyrogen-free 0.9% saline. Human TNF-α (specific activity, 5 × 107 units/mg) was provided by Genentech, Inc. Recombinant human IL-1β (specific activity, 4 × 108 units/mg) was a gift from Dr. Charles A. Dinarello (University of Colorado, Denver, CO). The cytokines were freshly diluted to desired concentrations in pyrogen-free 0.9% saline containing 0.1% human serum albumin. Oligo(dT)-cellulose type 77F was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Wy-14,643 was purchased from Sigma and freshly resuspended in corn oil at the appropriate concentration. [α-32P]dCTP (3,000 Ci/mmol), [γ-32P]dATP (3,000 Ci/mmol), and [α-32P]dUTP (800 Ci/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. Male Syrian hamsters (140–160 g) were purchased from Simonsen Laboratories (Gilroy, CA). The animals were maintained in a normal-light-cycle room and were provided with rodent chow and waterad libitum. Anesthesia was induced with halothane. To assess the effect of the acute phase response on RXR, hamsters were injected intraperitoneally with 0.1–100 μg/100 g of body weight (BW) LPS, 25 μg/100 g of BW TNF-α, or 1 μg/100 g of BW IL-1β in 0.5 ml of saline or with saline alone. To assess the effect of LPS treatment on PPARα activation, hamsters were injected IP daily with Wy-14,643 at a dosage of 5 mg/100 g of BW or with corn oil alone for 5 days. On the fifth day, 100 μg/100 g of BW LPS or saline alone was administered IP. Food was withdrawn at the time of injection because LPS and cytokines induce marked anorexia in rodents (28.Grunfeld C. Zhao C. Fuller J. Pollack A. Moser A. Friedman J. Feingold K.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 2152-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). Livers were removed after treatment at the times indicated below. The doses of LPS used in this study have significant effects on triglyceride and cholesterol metabolism without causing death (23.Feingold K.R. Pollock A.S. Moser A.H. Shigenaga J.K. Grunfeld C. J.

Res. 1993; 34: 2147-2158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, the nonlethal doses of TNF-α and IL-1β used in this study reproduce many of the effects of LPS on lipid metabolism, causing marked changes in serum lipid and lipoprotein levels (9.Hardardottir I. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1995; 23: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 30.Hardardottir I. Moser A.H. Memon R. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1994; 13: 161-166PubMed Google Scholar). Fresh liver (1.5–2 g) was homogenized in 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 25 mm KCl, 0.15 mm spermine, 1 mm EDTA, 2 msucrose, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, 2 mm sodium metavanadate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) at the times indicated below after LPS or saline treatment. Immediately following homogenization, nuclear proteins were extracted as described by Neish et al. (31.Neish A.S. Khachigian L.M. Park A. Baichwal V.R. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28903-28909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), except that 1 mm NaF, 0.1 mm metavanadate, and 1% protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) were added to all buffers. Nuclear protein content was determined by the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad), and yields were similar in control and LPS-treated groups. Denatured nuclear protein (25 μg) was loaded onto 10% polyacrylamide precast gels (Bio-Rad) and subjected to electrophoresis. After electrotransfer onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), blots were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.10% Tween and 5% dry milk for 1 h at room temperature and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the following polyclonal rabbit antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a dilution of 1:5000: anti-RXRα, anti-RXRβ, and anti-RXRγ. Immune complexes were detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey anti-rabbit IgG (dilution 1:20,000) according to the ECL Plus Western blotting kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoreactive bands obtained by autoradiography were quantified by densitometry. Total RNA was isolated from 300–400 mg of snap-frozen whole liver tissue by a modified acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method (32.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar) as described earlier (21.Memon R.A. Fuller J. Moser A.H. Smith P.J. Feingold K.R. Grunfeld C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E64-E72PubMed Google Scholar). Poly(A)+ RNA was purified using oligo(dT) cellulose and quantified by measuring absorption at 260 nm. Ten micrograms of poly(A)+ or 20 μg of total RNA were denatured and electrophoresed on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel. The uniformity of sample applications was checked by UV visualization of the acridine orange-stained gel before electrotransfer to Nytran membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), or when indicated, p18S was used as a control probe. We and others have found that LPS increases actin mRNA levels in liver by 2–5-fold in rodents (29.Feingold K.R. Hardardottir I. Memon R. Krul E.J. Moser A.H. Taylor J.M. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid. Res. 1993; 34: 2147-2158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Morrow J.F. Stearman R.S. Peltzman C.G. Potter D.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 4718-4722Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). TNF and IL-1 produced a 2-fold increase in actin mRNA levels. LPS also produces a 2-fold increase in glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and a 2.6-fold increase in cyclophilin mRNA (20.Memon R.A. Feingold K.R. Moser A.H. Fuller J. Grunfeld C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E210-E217PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the mRNA levels of actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and cyclophilin, which are widely used to normalize data, cannot be used to study LPS or cytokine-induced regulation of proteins in liver. However, the differing direction of the changes in mRNA levels for specific proteins after LPS or cytokine administration, the magnitude of the alterations, and the relatively small standard error of the mean make it unlikely that the changes observed were due to unequal loading of mRNA (20.Memon R.A. Feingold K.R. Moser A.H. Fuller J. Grunfeld C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: E210-E217PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Feingold K.R. Pollock A.S. Moser A.H. Shigenaga J.K. Grunfeld C. J. Lipid.

Moser A.H. Smith P.J. Feingold K.R. Grunfeld C. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: E64-E72PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were probed with [α-32P]dCTP labeled cDNAs using the random priming technique. mRNA levels were detected by exposure of the membrane to x-ray film and quantified by densitometry. hRXRα cDNA was a gift from Dr. Daniel D. Bikle (University of California, San Francisco, CA). mouse RXRβ, mouse RXRγ, human LXRα, and human LXRβ cDNAs were kindly provided by Dr. David J. Mangelsdorf (University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, TX). RACS cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. Pamela J. Smith (Ross Products Division, Abbott Laboratories, Columbus, OH). rPPARα, mPPARδ, and mPPARγ cDNAs were a gift from Dr. Anthony Bass (University of California San Francisco, CA). Isolation of liver nuclei from fresh tissue, the procedure for in vitro nuclear transcription and hybridization was essentially as described by Clarkeet al. (35.Clarke C.F. Fogelman A.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14363-14367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, nuclei were incubated with 200 μCi of [α-32P]UTP, and after labeling nascent transcripts for 30 min at 30 °C, total RNA was recovered according to Chomczynski and Sacchi (32.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). After prehybridization, all of thein vitro labeled RNA isolated (2–9 × 106cpm total) from nuclei of control and LPS-treated hamsters were hybridized to prepared nylon membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). After being washed and autoradiographed, the filters were air-dried, and the amount of in vitro labeled RNA that hybridized to each dot containing 10 μg of cDNA for RXRα, RXRβ, RXRβ, actin, and vector pUC19 was measured by liquid scintillation counting. 10 μg of crude nuclear extract were incubated on ice for 30 min with 6 × 104 cpm of 32P-labeled oligonucleotides in 15 μl of binding buffer (20% glycerol, 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 40 mm KCl, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol), 2 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 1 μg of salmon sperm DNA. Double-stranded oligonucleotide probes were end-labeled with T4-polynucleotide kinase in presence of 50 μCi of [γ-32P]dATP and purified on a Sephadex G-25 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the LXR oligonucleotide was subsequently gel-purified. DNA-protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis (constant voltage of 300 V) on a 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE at 4 °C. The gel was dried, exposed to x-ray film, and quantified by densitometry. In the competition assay, a 100-fold molar excess of the specific or mutated unlabeled oligonucleotide was preincubated on ice for 1 h with 10 μg of nuclear extract from control hamster in the binding buffer before adding the oligonucleotide probe. The following oligonucleotides were used: PPAR response element, 5′-GATCCTCCCGAACGTGACCTTTGTCCTGGTCCA-3′ (36.Ren B. Thelen A. Jump D.B. J. Biol.

In supershift studies, control nuclear extract was preincubated with 2 μl of one of the following antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature prior to the addition of the labeled probe: anti-RXRα, anti-RXRβ, anti-RXRγ, and anti-rabbit IgG. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. of experiments from 3–5 animals per group for each time point. The difference between two experimental groups was analyzed using the unpaired t test. Differences among multiple groups were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance with the Dunnett's post-test correction. A p value < 0.05 was considered significant. We initially determined the effect of LPS administration on RXRα protein levels in the nuclei from liver of Syrian hamsters. RXRα is the most abundant RXR isoform in liver. As shown in Fig. 1 A,LPS (100 μg/100 g of BW) produced a maximum decrease (62%) in RXRα protein levels at 4 h. A similar decrease was also present at 8 h following LPS treatment, but by 16 h, RXRα protein was returning toward normal levels (23% decrease at 16 h). As shown in Fig. 2 A, the LPS-induced decrease in RXRα protein levels was dose-dependent, with the half-maximal effect occurring at approximately 2 μg/100 g of BW. Thus, LPS at relatively low doses (LD50 for LPS in rodents is approximately 5 mg/100 g of BW) rapidly decreases RXRα protein levels in the liver of Syrian hamsters.Figure 2Dose response of the regulation by LPS of RXR α (A), RXR β (B), and RXR γ (C) proteins in hamster liver. Syrian hamsters were injected IP with either saline or LPS at the doses indicated, and the animals were sacrificed 4 h after LPS administration. Hepatic nuclear extracts were prepared, and Western blot analysis was carried out as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data (means ± S.E., n = 5) are expressed as a percentage of controls. **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.005 versus control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next determined whether this decrease in RXRα protein levels was associated with alterations in RXRα mRNA levels in the liver. As shown in Fig. 3 A, LPS administration resulted in a marked reduction (97%) in RXRα mRNA levels in the liver of Syrian hamsters at 4 h. To determine whether this decrease in mRNA levels was due to an inhibition of transcription, nuclear run-on assays were performed on nuclei prepared from hamster liver 4 h after LPS or saline injection. As shown in Fig. 4 A, LPS treatment resulted in a 38% decrease in RXRα transcription compared with control. Therefore, the decrease in RXRα protein levels following LPS administration is associated with a decrease in mRNA levels that is partially accounted for by LPS inhibition ofRXRα gene transcription. However, the modest reduction in transcription compared with the marked decrease in mRNA levels suggests that post-transcriptional factors in addition to inhibition of transcription contribute to the LPS-induced decrease in RXRα mRNA levels.Figure 4Effect of LPS treatment on RXRα(A), RXRβ(B), and RXRγ(C) gene transcription rates in hamster liver. Syrian hamsters were injected IP with either saline or LPS (100 μg of LPS/100 g of BW). Four hours later, livers were removed, and nuclei for in vitro transcription were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data (means ± S.E., n = 5) are expressed as a percentage of controls. ***, p < 0.005 versus control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because cytokines, such as TNF and IL-1, mediate many of the changes induced by LPS administration, we next examined the effect of TNF and/or IL-1 on RXRα mRNA levels. As shown in Fig. 3 B,2 h after the administration of TNF, IL-1, or TNF plus IL-1, there was a 63, 60, and 80% reduction in RXRα mRNA levels, respectively. Thus, the combination of TNF and IL-1 can reproduce the effects of LPS. Both RXRβ and RXRγ are also present in the liver but are expressed at lower levels than RXRα. As shown in Fig. 1, B andC, LPS treatment (100 μg/100 g of BW) resulted in a decrease in RXRβ and RXRγ protein levels in the liver of Syrian hamsters. RXRγ was decreased by 61% as early as 2 h after LPS administration but returned to normal by 8 h (Fig. 1 C). RXRβ protein levels also rapidly decreased following LPS treatment, but in contrast to RXRγ, this decrease was sustained for at least 16 h (Fig. 1 B). The decrease in protein levels of RXRγ and RXRβ induced by LPS was a sensitive response, with the half-maximal effect seen at less than 1 μg of LPS/100 g of BW for RXRγ (Fig. 2 C) and approximately 1 μg of LPS/100 g of BW for RXRβ (Fig. 2 B). Thus, LPS treatment not only decreases RXRα protein levels but also decrease"

One of these priming steps involves the maintenance of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-4,5-P2) through lipid kinases and is responsible for at least 70% of the ATP-dependent secretion observed in digitonin-permeabilized chromaffin cells. PtdIns-4,5-P2is usually thought to reside on the plasma membrane. However, because phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase is an integral chromaffin granule membrane protein, PtdIns-4,5-P2 important in exocytosis may reside on the chromaffin granule membrane. In the present study we have investigated the localization of PtdIns-4,5-P2 that is involved in exocytosis by transiently expressing in chromaffin cells a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that specifically binds PtdIns-4,5-P2 and is fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP). The PH-GFP protein predominantly associated with the plasma membrane in chromaffin cells without any detectable association with chromaffin granules. Rhodamine-neomycin, which also binds to PtdIns-4,5-P2, showed a similar subcellular localization. The transiently expressed PH-GFP inhibited exocytosis as measured by both biochemical and electrophysiological techniques. The results indicate that the inhibition was at a step after Ca2+ entry and suggest that plasma membrane PtdIns-4,5-P2 is important for exocytosis. Expression of PH-GFP also reduced calcium currents, raising the possibility that PtdIns-4,5-P2 in some manner alters calcium channel function in chromaffin cells.

It was subsequently found that the PtdIns-4,5-P2 could directly interact with and regulate the function of several cytoskeletal proteins (4.Janmey P.A. Stossel T.P.

Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 797-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), indicating the lipids are likely to be able to regulate other complex cellular functions. Evidence has since accumulated that the polyphosphoinositides interact with specific proteins in a variety of vesicular trafficking pathways including exocytosis and endocytosis and are necessary for the proper functioning of these pathway (for reviews, see Refs. 8.De Camilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 9.Martin T.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Cooper C.L. Low M.G. Holz R.W. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Studies in permeabilized chromaffin cells demonstrated that the secretory pathway could be separated into distinct kinetic steps with different biochemical characteristics (12.Holz R.W.

A slow ATP-dependent priming step preceded a rapid Ca2+-dependent triggering step. Subsequent studies demonstrated that a major component of the ATP dependence of secretion reflected the maintenance of the polyphosphoinositides. The enzymatic removal of phosphatidylinositol in permeabilized cells resulted in the subsequent decline in PtdIns-4,5-P2 and PtdIns-4-P and the specific inhibition of ATP-dependent secretion (11.Eberhard D.A. Cooper C.L. Low M.G. Holz R.W. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Studies in PC12 cells strongly advanced the concept. Two cytosolic factors that were necessary for ATP-dependent priming of exocytosis were identified as a phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (15.Hay J.C. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1993; 366: 572-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate kinase (16.Hay J.C. Fisette P.L. Jenkins G.H. Fukami K. Takenawa T. Anderson R.A. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). These studies directly implicated PtdIns-4,5-P2. Polyphosphoinositides have also been implicated in synaptic vesicle exocytosis (17.Wiedemann C. Schafer T. Burger M.M. Sihra T.S. J.

Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 52: 827-836Google Scholar). Polyphosphoinositides labeled in the 3-position of the inositol ring are necessary for vesicular trafficking between the Golgi and vacuole/lysosome in yeast and mammalian cells (10.Wurmser A.E.

Halestrap A.P. Biochem. J. 1987; 241: 835-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, it has also long been known that PtdIns 4-kinase, one of the key enzymes in PtdIns-4,5-P2 synthesis, is an integral membrane protein of the chromaffin granule membrane (24.Buckley J.T. Lefebvre Y.A. Hawthorne J.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 239: 517-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 25.Phillips J.H. Biochem.

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 968: 261-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). PtdIns 4-kinase is also associated with synaptic vesicles (17.Wiedemann C. Schafer T. Burger M.M. Sihra T.S. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5594-5602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and mast cell granules (28.Kurosawa M. Parker C. J. Immunol. 1986; 136: 616-622PubMed Google Scholar). It is, therefore, possible that PtdIns-4,5-P2 could be synthesized on the secretory granule membrane through the sequential action of granule PtdIns 4-kinase and PtdIns-4-P 5-kinase.There are several chromaffin granule membrane proteins that have been implicated in exocytosis that specifically bind PtdIns-4,5-P2: synaptotagmin (29.Schiavo G. Gu Q.-M. Prestwich G.D. Sollner T. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13327-13332Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion (30.Loyet K.M. Kowalchyk J.A. Chaudhary A. Chen J. Prestwich G.D. Martin T.F.J.

Holz R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10240-10248Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). If the interaction of one or more of the proteins with PtdIns-4,5-P2 is involved in secretion, there will be mechanistic consequences of the localization of PtdIns-4,5-P2.In the present study we have investigated the localization of PtdIns-4,5-P2 that is involved in exocytosis by transiently expressing in chromaffin cells a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that specifically binds PtdIns-4,5-P2 and is fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP). PH domains are approximately 100-amino acid motifs with a common tertiary structure with little sequence homology and different binding activities (for reviews, see Refs. 32.Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1996; 85: 621-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar and 33.Rebecchi M.J. Scarlata S. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1998; 27: 503-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The PH domain of phospholipase Cδ1 is responsible for the binding of the enzyme to its substrate, PtdIns-4,5-P2, on the plasma membrane (34.Paterson H.F. Savopoulos J.W. Perisic O. Cheung R. Ellis M.V. Williams R.L. Katan M. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The isolated PH domain binds specifically and with high affinity to PtdIns-4,5-P2 and to Ins(1,4,5)P3 (35.Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. O'Brien R. Sigler P.B. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12748-12753Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) because of strong interactions between PH domain residues and the 4-and 5-phosphates on the inositol ring (38.Ferguson K.M. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar). A protein ligand for PH δ1 has not been identified. Recently, the phospholipase C δ1 PH domain fused to GFP (PH-GFP) was used to visualize PtdIns-4,5-P2in cells (39.Varnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 40.Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 343-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transiently expressed protein was predominantly localized to the plasma membrane in unstimulated NIH-3T3, COS-7, and adrenal glomerulosa cells, but translocated to the cytosol upon stimulation of phospholipase C. There was a strong correlation between the translocation and the loss of PtdIns-4,5-P2 (39.Varnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). We have transiently expressed the same fusion protein in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells. We demonstrate that it predominantly associates with the plasma membrane without any detectable association with chromaffin granules. Localization of PtdIns-4,5-P2 was also investigated with rhodamine-labeled neomycin. Neomycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic that strongly binds PtdIns-4–5-P2 (41.Schacht J. J. Neurochem. 1976; 27: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 42.Schacht J. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 1063-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Gabev E. Kasianowicz J. Abbott T. McLaughlin S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 979: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Rhodamine-neomycin also labeled the plasma membrane. Transiently expressed PH-GFP specifically inhibited exocytosis in intact and permeabilized cells, indicating that plasma membrane PtdIns-4,5-P2is important for exocytosis.DISCUSSIONKinetically distinct steps can be distinguished in the secretory response from neuroendocrine cells, with slow ATP-dependent priming steps preceding the triggering of exocytosis by Ca2+ (12.Holz R.W.

Two ATP-dependent steps have been identified that occur seconds to minutes before the triggering of exocytosis by Ca2+. One involves α-SNAP andN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor (NSF), which regulates the interaction and conformation of SNAREs (57.Chamberlain L.H. Roth D. Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1063-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 58.Barnard R.J. Morgan A. Burgoyne R.D. Mol. Biol.

Low M.G. Holz R.W. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 15.Hay J.C. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1993; 366: 572-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar,16.Hay J.C. Fisette P.L. Jenkins G.H. Fukami K. Takenawa T. Anderson R.A. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). This latter effect of ATP is responsible for at least 70% of the ATP-dependent secretion evident in digitonin-permeabilized chromaffin cells (11.Eberhard D.A. Cooper C.L. Low M.G. Holz R.W. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). In the present study, we visualized plasma membrane PtdIns-4,5-P2 in chromaffin cells and provide evidence that this pool of PtdIns-4,5-P2 is involved in exocytosis.PH δ1 Identifies Plasma Membrane PtdIns-4,5-P2 in Chromaffin CellsThe PH domain of phospholipase Cδ1 binds to PtdIns-4,5-P2 in membranes and is responsible for the tethering of the enzyme to its membrane site of action. It has previously been demonstrated that a fusion protein of this domain with GFP permits visualization of PtdIns-4,5-P2 in a variety of cells (39.Varnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar, 40.Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 343-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When transiently expressed in chromaffin cells, PH-GFP almost exclusively labeled the plasma membrane without detectable labeling of chromaffin granules. A small amount was sometimes observed on the nuclear membrane, and low concentrations were in the cytosol in unstimulated cells. This labeling pattern is specific for active PH domain. A mutant, PH(S34T,R40L)-GFP, which is unable to bind to PtdIns-4,5-P2, was well expressed but completely cytosolic.Experiments with rhodamine-neomycin confirmed that PtdIns-4,5-P2 is associated with the plasma membrane. Neomycin binds PtdIns-4,5-P2 in vitro (41.Schacht J. J. Neurochem. 1976; 27: 1119-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 42.Schacht J. J. Lipid Res. 1978; 19: 1063-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43.Gabev E. Kasianowicz J. Abbott T. McLaughlin S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 979: 105-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) and binds PtdIns-4,5-P2 in chromaffin cells (11.Eberhard D.A. Cooper C.L. Low M.G. Holz R.W. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Rhodamine-neomycin, although less specific than PH-GFP in its associations in the cell, labeled the plasma membrane in permeabilized cells in the presence of ATP. It is likely that rhodamine-neomycin labeled plasma membrane PtdIns-4,5-P2 because labeling was much less evident when PtdIns-4,5-P2 was permitted to decline by permeabilizing cells in the absence of ATP (11.Eberhard D.A. Cooper C.L. Low M.G. Holz R.W. Biochem. J. 1990; 268: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Rhodamine-neomycin also labeled nuclear structures, perhaps reflecting the presence of nuclear PtdIns-4,5-P2 (60.Boronenkov I.V. Loijens J.C. Umeda M. Anderson R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3547-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). PH-GFP only infrequently labeled intracellular, nonnuclear, punctate structures.Chromaffin granules were labeled with neither PH-GFP nor rhodamine-neomycin. It is possible that an unknown plasma membrane protein ligand for PH δ1 together with PtdIns-4,5-P2 caused preferential binding of PH-GFP to the plasma membrane. Alternatively, PH-GFP, because of its large size, may not be able to bind to chromaffin granule membrane PtdIns-4,5-P2 because of limited accessibility. However, rhodamine-neomycin binding to PtdIns-4,5-P2 is unlikely to be limited in the same manner. Although the data are not conclusive, they suggest that the chromaffin granule membrane may contain significantly less PtdIns-4,5-P2 than the plasma membrane. The findings are consistent with other data. Isolated chromaffin granules can convert 40% of their PtdIns to PtdIns-4-P in the presence of ATP with little or no synthesis of PtdIns-4,5-P2 (61.Hawthorne J.N. Adnan N.M. Lymberopoulos G. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1980; 8: 30-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Chromaffin granules isolated from permeabilized chromaffin cells that had been incubated in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP after sequential pharmacological inhibition and reversal of inhibition of PtdIns 4-kinase contained significant [γ-32P]PtdIns-4-P but undetectable [γ-32P]PtdIns-4,5-P2 (62.Wiedemann C. Schafer T. Burger M.M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2094-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Synaptic vesicles may also contain little PtdIns-4,5-P2. A recent report indicates that, although PtdIns-4,5-P2 is essential for budding from the plasma membrane and endocytosis in the exocytosis/endocytosis cycle of synaptic vesicles, the lipid must be dephosphorylated in order for the clathrin-coated endocytic vesicle to transform into a functional synaptic vesicle (63.Cremona O. Di Paolo G. Wenk M.R. Luthi A. Kim W.T. Takei K. Daniell L. Nemoto Y. Shears S.B. Flavell R.A. McCormick D.A. De Camilli P. Cell. 1999; 99: 179-188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar).Plasma Membrane PtdIns-4,5-P2 Is Important in ExocytosisAlthough the data do not rule out the presence of PtdIns-4,5-P2 on the chromaffin granule membrane, the specific labeling of plasma membrane PtdIns-4,5-P2 by PH-GFP provided the opportunity to determine whether this pool of PtdIns-4,5-P2 is the pool required for exocytosis. We used four different ways of stimulating exocytosis and in every case, the expression of PH-GFP significantly inhibited secretion. DMPP- or Ba2+-induced secretion from intact cells expressing PH-GFP was inhibited by greater than 50%. Because the inhibition could have been caused by a PH-GFP-induced change in either Ca2+ or Ba2+ influx in the transfected cells rather than by a downstream effect on the secretory response, secretion from permeabilized cells in which the Ca2+ concentration is directly controlled was investigated. The expression of PH-GFP inhibited by 50% secretion directly stimulated by 30 μmCa2+. Finally, patch clamp measurements of capacitance increases (reflecting insertion of chromaffin granule membrane into the plasma membrane upon exocytosis), indicate that secretion was similarly inhibited by the expression of PH-GFP. Capacitance increases were reduced by 50% or greater for a given amount of Ca2+influx. Although it is possible that the reduced increase in capacitance reflects more rapid endocytosis rather than reduced exocytosis, the data are consistent with the inhibition of secretion measured by biochemical means over a longer time. Taken together, these experiments strongly implicate an important role for plasma membrane PtdIns-4,5-P2 in maintaining secretion in response to a Ca2+ signal.The inhibition of secretion by transiently expressed PH-GFP is similar to previous results with other agents that bind PtdIns-4–5-P2. Neomycin inhibits secretion from digitonin-permeabilized cells at concentrations that bind PtdIns-4,5-P2 in cells (11.Eberhard D.A. Cooper C.L. Low M.G. Holz R.W. Biochem.

A basic peptide derived from the C2b region of Rabphilin3 that binds PtdIns-4–5-P2-containing lipid vesicles, but not a scrambled amino acid derivative, inhibits secretion from permeabilized chromaffin cells (31.Chung S.-H.

These experiments with acute exposure to PtdIns-4,5-P2-binding agents and the present experiments with long term exposure to a PtdIns-4,5-P2-binding protein demonstrate a consistent inhibition of secretion.The polyphosphoinositides including PtdIns-4,5-P2 and 3-phosphorylated forms interact with and regulate numerous cytoskeletal proteins and proteins involved in vesicular trafficking (reviewed in Refs. 10.Wurmser A.E.

The requirement of plasma membrane in secretion may reflect a role for the lipid in regulating cytoskeletal dynamics immediately adjacent to the plasma membrane during exocytosis (66.Vitale M.L. Seward E.P. Trifaro J.-M. Neuron. 1995; 14: 353-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) or the function of proteins specifically involved in the exocytotic pathway. It is intriguing that there are now three proteins associated with the chromaffin granule membrane that bind PtdIns-4,5-P2 in a specific manner: synaptotagmin (29.Schiavo G. Gu Q.-M. Prestwich G.D.

The Ca2+-regulated interaction of one or more of the proteins with PtdIns-4,5-P2 in the plasma membrane may modulate protein function and could possibly be directly involved in the fusion reaction.The electrophysiological experiments revealed a second effect of expression of PH-GFP to reduce the magnitude of the Ca2+currents. Ca2+ entry during each pulse was significantly reduced so that, by the end of the eighth pulse, the cumulative Ca2+ influx was approximately 30% lower (Fig.8 A). The smaller Ca2+ currents were not caused by PH-GFP-induced alteration in the kinetics of the Ca2+current. Instead, they may reflect fewer Ca2+ channels opening upon depolarization. This phenomenon remains to be investigated.Dynamics of PH-GFP Localization during Stimulation of Chromaffin Cells Probably Reflects the Activation of Phospholipase CThe characterization of PH-GFP in chromaffin cells revealed movement of PH-GFP from plasma membrane to cytosol upon stimulation with angiotensin II or DMPP. As described in other cell types (39.Varnai P. Balla T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 143: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar), this movement probably reflects the activation of phospholipase C. The movement of PH-GFP was observed despite the possible reduction of phospholipase C activity in transfected cells due to the binding of PtdIns-4,5-P2 by the PH domain.Angiotensin II activates phospholipase C through a G protein-linked receptor. The nicotinic agonist DMPP activates phospholipase C through a rise in cytosolic Ca2+ caused by Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane (51.Eberhard D.A. Holz R.W. J. Neurochem. 1987; 49: 1634-1643Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Because highly effective mechanisms for maintaining the levels of the polyphosphoinositides in chromaffin cells prevented either stimulus from causing large decreases in PtdIns-4,5-P2 (DMPP actually caused an increase in PtdIns-4,5-P2; see Table I and Ref. 48.Eberhard D.A. Holz R.W. Cell. Mol. Neurobiol. 1991; 11: 357-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), the translocation of PH-GFP to the cytosol probably did not result from decreased levels of PtdIns-4,5-P2. Instead, translocation of PH-GFP may have occurred because of increases in cytosolic Ins(1,4,5)P3. PH δ1 has as least as high an affinity for Ins(1,4,5)P3 as for membrane PtdIns-4,5-P2 (35.Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. O'Brien R. Sigler P.B. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The increased amounts of cytosolic Ins(1,4,5)P3would be expected to compete with membrane PtdIns-4,5-P2for PH-GFP.Only a small part of the translocation is likely to be caused by membrane changes associated with exocytosis. The influx of Ca2+ induced by DMPP stimulates secretion of 20–30% of the total cellular catecholamine in contrast to the rise in cytosolic Ca2+ induced by angiotensin II which stimulates no more than 2% release (67.O'Sullivan A.J. Burgoyne R.D. Biosci. Rep. 1999; 9: 243-252Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). 2M. A. Bittner and R. W. Holz, unpublished observations DMPP was no more effective than angiotensin II in causing a redistribution of PH-GFP. Furthermore, Ba2+ influx, which is a strong stimulus for exocytosis, caused a much smaller increase in cytosolic PH-GFP than either angiotensin II or DMPP. Ba2+ is distinguished from angiotensin II and DMPP by notstimulating phospholipase C activity and an increase in Ins(1,4,5)P3 in chromaffin cells (51.Eberhard D.A. Holz R.W. J.

The importance of inositol phospholipids, especially the polyphosphoinositides, in cell function was first recognized because of their involvement in cell signaling as substrates for phospholipase C with the resulting production of Ins(1,4,5)P3 1and diacylglycerol (1.Hokin M.R.

Mammalian RNRs are composed of two nonidentical subunits, proteins R1 and R2. The levels of the limiting R2 protein control overall RNR activity during the mammalian cell cycle, being undetectable in G1 phase and increasing in S phase. We show that in proliferating mammalian cells, the transcription of the R2 gene, once activated in the beginning of S phase, reaches its maximum 6–7 h later and then declines. Surprisingly, DNA damage and replication blocks neither increase nor prolong the R2 promoter activity in S phase. Instead, the cell cycle activity of the mammalian enzyme is controlled by an S phase/DNA damage-specific stabilization of the R2 protein, which is effective until cells pass into mitosis.

Science. 1993; 260: 1773-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, the enzyme is composed of two nonidentical subunits, proteins R1 and R2, which are both required for activity. The R1 protein contains redox active disulfides, an active site that binds ribonucleoside diphosphates and also two different allosteric sites binding nucleoside triphosphates (2.Thelander L. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 133-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Enzyme activity is controlled by binding ATP (stimulation) or dATP (inhibition) to the allosteric activity site, whereas substrate specificity is controlled by binding ATP, dATP, dTTP, or dGTP to the specificity site. A failure in the control of the dNTP levels and/or their relative amounts leads to cell death or genetic abnormalities (3.Reichard P. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Protein R2 contributes an essential iron center-generated tyrosyl free radical that can be scavenged by hydroxyurea (4.Thelander M. Gräslund A. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2737-2741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, both enzyme activity and the R1 and R2 mRNAs are cell cycle-regulated with maximal levels during S phase (5.Björklund S. Skog S. Tribukait B. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5452-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 6.Engström Y. Eriksson S. Jildevik I. Skog S. Thelander L. Tribukait B. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 9114-9116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The levels of the R1 protein are constant and in excess during the cell cycle, because of a long half-life (more than 20 h). The R2 protein, by contrast, shows an S phase-specific expression, has a half-life of 3 h in logarithmically growing cell cultures, and is limiting for activity (7.Eriksson S. Gräslund A. Skog S. Thelander L. Tribukait B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11695-11700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Mann G.J. Musgrove E.A. Fox R.M. Thelander L. Cancer Res. 1988; 48: 5151-5156PubMed Google Scholar). There is no evidence that DNA damaging agents or drugs that block replication activate transcription of the mammalian RNR1 genes during S phase. Furthermore, it is well established that Escherichia coliand mammalian ribonucleotide reductases control the size of the deoxyribonucleotide pools via dATP inhibition of the enzyme (2.Thelander L. Reichard P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 133-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (904) Google Scholar). Consequently, overproduction of ribonucleotide reductase in mammalian cells generally does not lead to increased dNTP pools (1.Reichard P. Science. 1993; 260: 1773-1777Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar), whereas a mutation in the R1 protein destroying dATP feedback inhibition does (9.Meuth M. Green H.

A. 1981; 78: 2447-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). In this paper, we present new data showing how ribonucleotide reductase is controlled during the normal mammalian cell cycle and after DNA damage. We demonstrate that transcription of the mouse R2 gene is uncoupled from the S phase progression and is not influenced by DNA damage or replication blocks. Instead, the R2 protein is specifically stabilized during S phase and in response to DNA damage and is rapidly degraded after cells enter into mitosis. In combination with the dATP feedback control, the controlled degradation of the R2 protein directly regulates ribonucleotide reduction in proliferating mammalian cells. [γ-32P]ATP and [35S]methionine/cysteine (PRO-MIX [35S]cell labeling mix) were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; hydroxyurea and roscovitine were from Calbiochem; and aphidicolin, nocodazole, and LLnL were from Sigma. Recombinant Cdc2/cyclin B complex was obtained from New England Biolabs. Anti-pR2 protein polyclonal antibodies were developed in rabbits against the peptide acetyl-QLQL(phospho)SPLKRLC-amide, corresponding to mouse R2 protein amino acid residues 16–25, and affinity purified by QCB, Inc. JC4 anti-mouse R2 protein rat monoclonal antibodies were previously developed in our laboratory (11.Engström Y. Rozell B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 1615-1620Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Mouse recombinant R1 and R2 proteins were prepared from BL21(DE3)pLysS bacteria containing the plasmids pETM1 or pETM2 and purified to homogeneity according to Refs. 12.Davis R. Thelander M.

The R2 promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct was created by ligating a 1517-base pairPvuII-PvuII R2 promoter fragment (nucleotides −1500 to +17 relative to the major transcription start) into the pGL3 vector (Promega) digested with EcoICRI and NcoI endonucleases and blunted with the Klenow fragment. The pM2Hind13 plasmid containing the entire mouse R2 gene was partly digested withClaI (at nucleotide −1006) and NdeI. The long DNA fragment was isolated, blunted with the Klenow fragment, and religated. The R2 gene mutants were created by overlap extension polymerase chain reaction of a NgoMI-NgoMI fragment (nucleotides −169 to +181), where the required mutations were introduced. The created fragments were then ligated into the native R2 gene instead of the original fragment, which resulted in either the replacement of the Ser20 residue by Ala (S20A mutant) or the deletion of the residues 2–20 (Δ20 mutant). All constructs were verified by restriction analysis and sequencing of polymerase chain reaction amplified regions. Mouse Balb/3T3 (American Type Culture Collection number CCL-163) cells were cultured in DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and 10% v/v heat-inactivated (56 °C, 30 min) horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Flow cytometry was carried out on a CCA-I flow cytometer, according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Partec GmbH). For synchronization by serum starvation, 3 × 105 cells were plated per 5-cm dish. After 24 h, the medium was replaced with 5 ml of DMEM containing 0.6% heat-inactivated horse serum. After 36 h, this medium was replaced with 5 ml of DMEM containing 20% heat-inactivated horse serum; the cells were harvested at various intervals as described below. UV irradiation of cells, transfection by electroporation with linearized vectors and selection of stably transformed clones were performed as described earlier (14.Filatov D. Björklund S. Johansson E. Thelander L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23698-23704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The R2 promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct was linearized withXmnI, and the R2 gene constructs were linearized withHindIII prior to electroporation. Luciferase assays were performed on cell lysates obtained by incubating cells with the Cell Culture Lysis Reagent (Promega) according to the instructions of the manufacturer; luciferase activity was measured in a TD-20/20 Luminometer (Turner Designs) using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega). Luciferase activity was expressed in light units normalized against the protein concentration in the lysates, as measured by the Bradford method. Expression of the transfected R2 gene in the stably transformed clones was verified by incubating the cells in increasing concentrations of hydroxyurea and by determining the IC50value as described before (15.Suttle D.P. Stark G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 4602-4607Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For immunoblotting, cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, and then lysed for 10 min on ice by the addition of 200 μl of lysis buffer (PBS, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and LLnL, 40 ng/ml staurosporine, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). The lysates were collected with a rubber policeman, and debris was centrifuged at 20,000 ×g, 4 °C for 20 min. Equal amounts of protein from the lysates were electrophoresed in separate lanes on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were then transferred to Hybond-C extra membranes in a Mini Trans-Blot Cell (Bio-Rad Laboratories) at 200 mA, 4 °C for 1 h. After transfer, the membranes were blocked in PBS containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, and 2% nonfat dry milk for 30 min; then either JC4 anti-R2 rat monoclonal antibodies or anti-pR2 rabbit polyclonal antibodies were added. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, membranes were washed and further incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. After two washes, detection was done using the ECL-plus system, according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For pulse labeling with radioactive methionine/cysteine, the cells were washed twice with prewarmed methionine/cysteine-free DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and then incubated for 10 min in the same medium. Next, the cells were labeled for 10 min in the same medium, supplemented with 71.5 μCi/ml PRO-MIX [35S]cell labeling mix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For the chase, the cells were washed twice with prewarmed complete DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and further incubated in the same medium. For immunoprecipitation, cells were rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS, pH 7.4, and then lysed for 10 min on ice by the addition of 1 ml of lysis buffer as above. The lysate was collected with a rubber policeman, and debris was centrifuged at 20,000 × g, 4 °C for 20 min. Supernatant was incubated for 16 h at 4 °C with 5 μg of JC4 antibodies and 15 μl of protein G-agarose beads (Sigma). The beads were washed six times with 1 ml of PBS, pH 7.4, supplemented with 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, boiled in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer for 5 min, and loaded directly on the 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After the immune complexes were separated by electrophoresis, the gels were dried, and radioactivity was quantified on a phosphoimager (Bio-Rad). The activity of the mouse R2 promoter during S phase was assayed using an R2 promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct, which was stably transformed into mouse Balb/3T3 fibroblasts. The cells were synchronized by serum starvation and released by serum readdition to progress synchronously through the cell cycle. Fig.1 shows that luciferase activity increases when the cells enter S phase about 8 h after serum readdition; activity shows maximal values after about 15 h and then starts to decrease. This result resembles observations for the R2 mRNA levels (5.Björklund S. Skog S. Tribukait B. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5452-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). To test whether the R2 promoter can be additionally activated at the time of maximal DNA synthesis, we applied hydroxyurea, aphidicolin, or UV light to cells synchronously passing through the S phase 18 h after the release from serum starvation (Fig. 1). Cell cycle progression was immediately stopped, as observed through flow cytometry, but the luciferase activity did not increase in the treated cells; it instead declined in the same manner as in the untreated cells, demonstrating that the activity of the R2 promoter was not affected by the DNA-damaging agents. Next, we tested whether DNA damaging agents applied before the onset of the S phase would, if not additionally activate the R2 promoter, then at least prolong the time window when the R2 promoter was active by blocking the cell cycle in early S phase. Aphidicolin or hydroxyurea were added to the cells in early G1 phase, 1 h after release from serum starvation (Fig. 1). Samples for luciferase assay and flow cytometry were collected every 2 h, beginning when the untreated cells entered S phase and ending when they reached the next G1 phase. Interestingly, the pattern and the overall activity of the R2 promoter were nearly identical in the drug-treated and untreated cells; maximal values were seen in the early-middle S phase and declined toward to the end of the cycle. This result indicates that transcription of the R2 gene is uncoupled from the S phase progression and is not affected by DNA damage or replication blocks. According to the existing model, levels of mammalian R2 protein follow the levels of the corresponding mRNA, because of the short half-life of the protein. Yet the levels of the R2 mRNA peak in the middle of S phase, at the time of maximal DNA synthesis (5.Björklund S. Skog S. Tribukait B. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5452-5458Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 16.Hengstschlager M. Mudrak I. Wintersberger E. Wawra E. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 1389-1394PubMed Google Scholar), whereas protein R2 levels and ribonucleotide reductase activity were reported to peak in the G2 phase (7.Eriksson S. Gräslund A. Skog S. Thelander L. Tribukait B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11695-11700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Murphree S. Stubblefield E. Moore E.C. Exp. Cell Res. 1969; 58: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Contradictory results from other groups demonstrate that maximal activity of ribonucleotide reductase coincides with the middle of S phase (18.Lewis W.H. Kuzik B.A. Wright J.A. J. Cell. Physiol. 1978; 94: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 19.Nordenskjöld B.A. Skoog L. Brown N.C. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1970; 245: 5360-5368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To resolve this discrepancy, we did careful immunoblotting measurement of the R2 protein levels in mouse Balb/3T3 cells, which were serum-starved and released to progress synchronously through the cell cycle. As seen in Fig. 2, R2 protein accumulates constantly during S phase and reaches its maximum long after the cells pass through the middle of S phase. Interestingly, after slow accumulation, protein R2 seemed to disappear quickly before the next cell cycle. Taken with the observation that the R2 mRNA and R2 protein reach maximal levels at different times in the cell cycle, this result suggested that the stability of the R2 protein might be regulated during the cell cycle. The half-life of the R2 protein in logarithmically growing cells is reported to range from 3 to 6 h (7.Eriksson S. Gräslund A. Skog S. Thelander L. Tribukait B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11695-11700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20.McClarty G.A. Chan A.K. Choy B.K. Thelander L. Wright J.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7524-7531Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Our own measurements using pulse-chase and immunoprecipitation techniques showed the same variation, depending on the growth state of the cell culture (data not shown). To compare the half-life of the R2 protein in different phases of the cell cycle, we synchronized mouse Balb/3T3 cells by serum starvation and pulse-labeled them with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 10 min in the early S phase. After a chase in complete medium and immunoprecipitation, we demonstrated that the R2 protein is very stable during S phase (Fig.3 A). In a similar experiment with larger intervals between each time point, we observed that the R2 protein becomes increasingly unstable as cells leave S phase and approach the next cell cycle (Fig. 3 B). Plotted on logarithmic graphs, the protein degradation data showed that in S phase the R2 protein disappears exponentially with a half-life of more than 20 h (Fig. 3 A), whereas in mitosis the degradation accelerates and is much faster relative to the calculated exponential or constant rates of degradation (Fig. 3 B). Hydroxyurea was previously shown to increase the half-life of the R2 protein 2-fold via an unknown mechanism (20.McClarty G.A. Chan A.K. Choy B.K. Thelander L. Wright J.A. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 7524-7531Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Here we tested the influence of hydroxyurea on protein R2 stability during the cell cycle. Cells were synchronized by serum starvation and incubated in the presence of hydroxyurea after they reached the middle of S phase. Upon the addition of hydroxyurea, the progression through the cell cycle was immediately blocked, but the levels of R2 protein remained constant during the 9-h incubation, as detected by immunoblotting (Fig.4 A). In contrast, the R2 protein levels in untreated cells decreased dramatically during the same period. A pulse-chase followed by immunoprecipitation confirmed that the R2 protein is not degraded when the cells are cultured in the presence of hydroxyurea (data not shown). To determine whether this stabilization of R2 protein was hydroxyurea-specific or a consequence of a block in the cell cycle, we utilized agents that stop the cell cycle but do not directly interact with the R2 protein. Aphidicolin, which blocks cell cycle progression by inhibiting the DNA polymerase α (21.Ikegami S. Taguchi T. Ohashi M. Oguro M. Nagano H. Mano Y. Nature. 1978; 275: 458-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar), had the same stabilizing effect on the R2 protein as hydroxyurea (Fig. 4 A). Exposure of mammalian cells to UV light also leads to a block in cell cycle progression as cells carry out repair of damaged DNA (22.Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D.C.1995: 611-618Google Scholar). When synchronized mouse Balb/3T3 cells were irradiated by UV light in late S phase, they were immediately arrested, with the R2 protein remaining at its maximal levels for at least 5 h (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, control cells not arrested by UV light degraded the R2 protein as they progressed through the cell cycle, as described above. Pulse-chase labeling and immunoprecipitation showed that the decay of R2 protein in S phase cells after irradiation by UV light was nearly undetectable (data not shown). Interestingly, in synchronized cells blocked by hydroxyurea or aphidicolin precisely on entry into S phase, R2 protein started to appear, and the levels increased with time, just as in control cells. Furthermore, the R2 protein was not degraded at the time when untreated cells reached the next cell cycle (Fig. 4 C). This result indicates that in S phase-committed cells, the R2 protein is synthesized and stabilized even in the absence of DNA replication. Hydroxyurea, aphidicolin, and UV light, although acting through different mechanisms, all block the synthesis of DNA. Therefore, the stability of the R2 protein may directly correlate with the presence of unreplicated DNA. Alternatively, R2 protein degradation could be triggered when cells pass a certain cell cycle transition. To distinguish between these possibilities, we made use of drugs that do not directly interfere with DNA synthesis but rather block the cell cycle when the S phase is completed. Roscovitine is a highly selective inhibitor of the cyclin-dependent kinases Cdc2, Cdk2, and Cdk5 (23.Meijer L. Borgne A. Mulner O. Chong J.P. Blow J.J. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. Delcros J.G. Moulinoux J.P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 243: 527-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (1181) Google Scholar). It blocks entry into mitosis by inactivating the Cdc2 kinase, with an average IC50 of 16 μm for mammalian cells, but it does not interfere with DNA synthesis at this concentration. S phase synchronized Balb/3T3 cells cultured in the presence of 20 μm roscovitine continued to synthesize DNA and accumulated in late G2 phase (Fig. 4 D). The R2 protein levels in the arrested cells remained the same as in S phase cells. These data indicate that R2 degradation is not activated before the cells pass into mitosis and that R2 degradation does not depend directly on the presence of unreplicated DNA. The cells exposed to 10 μm roscovitine were not completely blocked at G2/M, and they partially passed through mitosis. In this case, the R2 levels were lower than in the completely G2/M arrested cells, which indicates normal R2 degradation in the fraction of cells that were capable of passing through mitosis. To examine R2 protein stability during mitosis, S phase synchronized cells were cultured in the presence of nocodazole, which blocks the cell cycle in metaphase by interfering with the polymerization of microtubules. Our results show that the levels of R2 protein in the nocodazole-treated cells were very low and comparable with those in untreated cells (Fig. 4 D). This is in marked contrast to the high levels in cells arrested in S phase by hydroxyurea. Therefore, we conclude that the degradation of the R2 protein is triggered after the entrance into mitosis, but before or in metaphase. The proteasome inhibitor LLnL, applied to the synchronized cells in the middle of S phase, did not inhibit replication but blocked the cell cycle in mitosis, and it completely abolished the degradation of the R2 protein (data not shown). The mouse R2 protein is uniquely phosphorylated on Ser20 by cell cycle-dependent kinases both in vivo andin vitro, but the function of this phosphorylation has not been determined (24.Chan A.K. Litchfield D.W. Wright J.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 12835-12840Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 25.Chan A.K. Persad S. Litchfield D.W. Wright J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1448: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). However, the ribonucleotide reductase activity of in vitro phosphorylated R2 protein, assayed in the presence of an excess of R1 protein, did not differ from nonphosphorylated R2 protein (25.Chan A.K. Persad S. Litchfield D.W. Wright J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1448: 363-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). 2A. Chabes, unpublished observation. Because the phosphorylation status of an enzyme can be used as a regulatory signal for its degradation (26.Deshaies R.J. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 7-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we decided to investigate the effects of phosphorylation on protein R2 stability. First, we determined when R2 protein phosphorylation occurs during the cell cycle. We raised rabbit polyclonal antibodies specific to the phosphorylated form of mouse R2 protein (anti-pR2). Immunoblotting of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated R2 protein showed no cross-reactivity of the antibodies (Fig.5 A). Immunoblotting of protein extracts from synchronized mouse Balb/3T3 cells showed that the R2 protein becomes phosphorylated in early S phase, and it remains phosphorylated throughout the S and G2 phases until it disappears during mitosis. To further test the hypothesis that phosphorylation is involved in the regulation of R2 stability, we created R2 proteins with mutations in the phosphorylation site and studied their stability in vivo. We replaced the nucleotides encoding the Ser20residue with nucleotides coding for Ala (S20A mutant) or removed the nucleotides encoding amino acid residues 2–20 (Δ20 mutant) in a mouse R2 gene including a 1 kilobase promoter fragment. Our results show that both cell clones stably transformed with the native form of the R2 gene and with mutant forms confer resistance to HU and show the same regulation of the R2 protein stability as the nontransformed cells (Fig. 5 B). How important is the control of R2 protein levels, which determine the overall RNR activity, during the mammalian cell cycle? Constitutively expressed R2 protein in Balb/3T3 cells stably transformed with a retroviral expression vector containing mouse R2 cDNA led to a greatly increased frequency of focus formation in cooperation with Ha-ras transformation (27.Fan H. Villegas C. Wright J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14036-14040Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was suggested that a deregulated R2 protein might be a novel tumor progressor determinant, cooperating with a variety of oncogenes to determine transformation and tumorigenic potential. The presence of the R2 protein during the G1 phase theoretically would lead to an increase of dNTP pools to the S phase levels, because the R1 protein is available throughout the cell cycle. Because high dNTP pools are a prerequisite of an untimely replication, there should be a reliable mechanism to eliminate the R2 protein after the completion of DNA synthesis. Previously, it was believed that the cell cycle control of the R2 protein is achieved at the level of transcription in combination with an inherited short half-life of the R2 protein. Here, instead of a transcriptional control we found that differential protein stability tunes the R2 protein levels both during the mammalian cell cycle and, indirectly, after DNA damage or a replication block. Protein R2 slowly accumulates during S phase or in S phase arrested cells, and it does not undergo noticeable degradation before the cells enter mitosis. Degradation appears to correlate with passage into mitosis rather than being controlled by the presence of unreplicated DNA, as indicated by the results with roscovitine and nocodazole (Fig.6). That the ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent pathway is involved is suggested by the prevention of R2 protein degradation by the proteasome inhibitor LLnL. Another level of the mammalian RNR regulation is the feedback inhibition of the holoenzyme by dATP. This mechanism, along with an elaborate mammalian dNTP excretion system (reviewed in Ref. 3.Reichard P. Ann. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 349-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar), keeps the S phase dNTP pools at a level that is optimal for replication, which does not increase even when the limiting R2 protein is overproduced. For instance, in hydroxyurea-resistant, protein R2-overproducing mouse cells having 3–15 times higher RNR activity than the parent cells, all dNTP pools were close to normal, except for a 3–4 times higher dATP pool, as expected from the allosteric mechanism (28.Åkerblom L. Ehrenberg A. Gräslund A. Lankinen H. Reichard P. Thelander L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2159-2163Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Furthermore, hydroxyurea-resistant, protein R2-overproducing mouse mammary tumor TA 3 cells, containing about 40-fold more of R2 protein than the parent cells (7.Eriksson S. Gräslund A. Skog S. Thelander L. Tribukait B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 11695-11700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), had the same dNTP pools as the parent cells.2 In both of these cases the cell cycle regulation of the R2 protein is not disturbed. In contrast, the pyrimidine dNTP pools are increased 3-fold, and the purine dNTPs are increased 9-fold, in comparison with the parental cell line in mouse cells containing an R1 protein with a D57N mutation in the allosteric activity site, which abolishes dATP feedback inhibition (10.Weinberg G. Ullman B. Martin Jr., D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 2447-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The spontaneous mutation rate is about 100 times higher in this mutant cell line compared with the parental cells with a normal RNR, most probably reflecting both the dNTP pool unbalance and the overall increased pools. Our data demonstrate that DNA damage or replication blocks do not additionally induce the expression of the limiting R2 protein during the S phase. This suggests that the S phase levels of the R2 protein are sufficient for the maximal biochemical activity of the RNR holoenzyme allowed by the dATP feedback inhibition mechanism. Earlier, we reported that expression of the mouse R2 protein was regulated by an S phase-specific release from a transcriptional block (29.Björklund S. Skogman E. Thelander L. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4953-4959Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). This model was based on reporter gene studies and in vitro nuclear run-on experiments. However, we have not been able to verify our model in vivo; furthermore, our new R2 promoter-luciferase reporter gene constructs, such as the one used in this work, show a very good correlation between luciferase activity and R2 mRNA levels, which indicates a pure transcriptional control of cell cycle regulated R2 gene expression. Using cells stably transformed with the R2 promoter-luciferase reporter gene construct, we found that R2 promoter activity is neither increased nor prolonged in response to DNA damage or replication blocks after the cells enter the S phase. In contrast to earlier models, our new data suggest that transcription of the mouse R2 gene is turned on in the beginning of S phase, reaches its maximum 6–7 h later, and then decreases. This process, once initiated in the beginning of S phase, seems to be not affected by cell cycle progression or DNA damage. In support of our results with the reporter gene construct, it is demonstrated that the levels of the mouse R2 mRNA are not increased in logarithmically growing mouse SC 2 cells after addition of hydroxyurea, whereas R2 protein levels are elevated (30.McClarty G.A. Chan A.K. Engstrom Y. Wright J.A. Thelander L. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 8004-8011Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The increase in the R2 protein levels can be explained by accumulation of the S phase cells that cannot pass through mitosis and therefore cannot degrade the R2 protein. Furthermore, we observed no increase in R2 protein levels during a 9-h period after the addition of hydroxyurea to cells synchronized in the middle of S phase, which also indicated that the transcription of the R2 gene was neither increased nor prolonged. Pulse-chase experiments showed that there was no degradation of R2 protein during the same period. There is another example of an uncoupling of transcription of S phase genes (DNA polymerase α, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, and the two RNR subunits) from cell cycle progression, which is described in early Drosophila embryos (31.Duronio R.J. O'Farrel P.H. Development. 1994; 120: 1503-1515Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here, the coordinate program of transcription operates normally after cell cycle arrest in G2 phase of string mutant embryos; the program is controlled by developmental signals rather than by the cell cycle. The phosphorylation of the R2 protein by a cell cycle-dependent kinase was an obvious candidate for a regulatory signal triggering ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis. We determined that the earlier reported R2 protein phosphorylation occurs uniquely on a Ser20 residue as soon as newly synthesized R2 protein can be detected, and it remains until the R2 protein disappears during the mitosis. However, neither the in vitro activity nor the in vivo stability of the R2 protein seemed to be affected by this phosphorylation. The involvement of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome in R2 protein degradation appears less likely because this E3 ubiquitin protein ligase is not activated until cells are released from a nocodazole-induced mitotic arrest (32.Brandeis M. Hunt T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5280-5289Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). We show that the R2 protein is already degraded in nocodazole arrested cells. Furthermore, cyclosome-mediated degradation is dependent on “destruction boxes,” which are N-terminally located 9-amino acid regions containing two invariant residues RXXL (33.Glotzer M. Murray A.W. Kirschner M.W. Nature. 1991; 349: 132-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1881) Google Scholar). In mammalian R2 proteins, such a conserved sequence is present between amino acids 5 and 13. However, our Δ20 R2 protein mutant, lacking this putative destruction box, showed the same stability as native R2 protein (Fig. 5 B). Therefore, the signal for the regulated R2 proteolysis remains to be elucidated. Mammalian thymidine kinase (TK) is another example of a cell cycle-regulated protein, where enzyme activity is controlled by protein stabilization. In cycling cells, TK levels increase at the G1/S border and remain stable during S phase. The transcription of the TK gene is turned off at about mid-S phase; the protein is degraded rapidly during and after mitosis (34.Sutterluety H. Bartl S. Karlseder J. Wintersberger E. Seiser C. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 259: 383-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The signal for degradation appears to reside in the C terminus, but the details of the mechanisms involved in regulation of TK stability are not known. Finally, there might be an interesting link between the prolonged activity of the mammalian RNR, in response to replication blocks, and the requirement for dATP to trigger apoptosis. It has been shown that one way to initiate the apoptotic protease cascade requires the cytochrome c/dATP-dependent formation of an Apaf-1/caspase-9 complex (35.Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6156) Google Scholar). Here, dATP has a 1000-fold higher affinity for the Apaf-1 than does ATP. A sustained ribonucleotide reduction because of prolonged stability of the R2 protein in arrested cells might lead to a progressive increase in dATP levels, contributing to triggering apoptosis. In conclusion, we propose a new model for the cell cycle-dependent regulation of mammalian RNR during the normal cell cycle and after DNA damage/replication blocks (Fig. 6). The overall activity of the mammalian RNR during the cell cycle is controlled by the regulated stability of the limiting R2 protein.

https://openalex.org/W2074202320,"Binding of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transactivator (Tat) protein to Tat-responsive RNA (TAR) is essential for viral replication and is considered a promising starting point for the design of anti-HIV drugs. NMR spectroscopy indicated that the aminoglycosides neomycin B and ribostamycin bind to TAR and that neomycin is able to inhibit Tat binding to TAR. The solution structure of the neomycin-bound TAR has been determined by NMR spectroscopy. Chemical shift mapping and intermolecular nuclear Overhauser effects define the binding region of the aminoglycosides on TAR and give strong evidence for minor groove binding. Based on 15 nuclear Overhauser effect-derived intermolecular distance restraints, a model structure of the TAR-neomycin complex was calculated. Neomycin is bound in a binding pocket formed by the minor groove of the lower stem and the uridine-rich bulge of TAR, which adopts a conformation different from those known. The neamine core of the aminoglycoside (rings I and II) is covered with the bulge, explaining the inhibition of Tat by an allosteric mechanism. Neomycin reduces the volume of the major groove in which Tat is bound and thus impedes essential protein-RNA contacts."
https://openalex.org/W1977672942,"The mammalian heat shock transcription factor HSF-1 regulates the expression of the heat shock proteins, molecular chaperones that are involved in cellular processes from higher order assembly to protein degradation. HSF-1 is a phosphorylated monomer under physiological growth conditions and is located mainly in the cytoplasm. Upon activation by a variety of environmental stresses, HSF-1 is translocated into the nucleus, forms trimers, acquires DNA binding activity, is hyperphosphorylated, appears as punctate granules, and increases transcriptional activity of target genes. As cells recover from stress, the punctate granules gradually disappear, and HSF-1 appears in a diffused staining pattern in the cytoplasm and nucleus. We have previously shown that the mitogen-activated protein kinase ERK phosphorylates and suppresses HSF-1-driven transcription. Here, we show that c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) also phosphorylates and inactivates HSF-1. Overexpression of JNK facilitates the rapid disappearance of HSF-1 punctate granules after heat shock. Similar to ERK, JNK binds to HSF-1 in the conserved mitogen-activated protein kinases binding motifs and phosphorylates HSF-1 in the regulatory domain. The overexpression of an HSF-1-green fluorescent protein fusion construct lacking JNK phosphorylation sites causes this HSF-1 mutant to form nuclear granules that remain longer in the nucleus after heat shock.

Accumulation of HSPs following heat shock or other stresses are crucial for cells to survive further injury as they confer protection to different cellular components; they also prevent apoptosis (8.Li G.C.

Among the various HSFs, the mammalian HSF-1 is regulated by phosphorylation (15.Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 16.Mivechi N.F. Murai T. Hahn G.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 17.Baler R.

The nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and transcriptional activities of most mammalian transcription factors are regulated by phosphorylation. In many cases, multiple protein kinases can act on a single transcription factor (19.Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1993; 50: 823-829Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (772) Google Scholar). In the case of mammalian HSF-1, it appears to also be targeted by multiple protein kinases because it is phosphorylated under normal physiological growth conditions as well as after heat shock (15.Sarge K.D.

Following activation by heat shock, HSF-1 appears at the sites of transcription as several intensely staining punctate granules that become as large as 1.5–2.5 μm (23.He B. Meng Y,-H. Mivechi N.F.

The functional role of phosphorylation in relation to HSF-1 granule formation and the signaling pathways controlling HSF-1 activity is not entirely clear. Phosphorylated forms of HSF-1 protein have been extensively studied by phosphopeptide mapping as well as mutational analysis. The data suggest that HSF-1 is phosphorylated on multiple serine residues and, perhaps, a threonine residue (18.Knauf U. Newton E.M. Kyriakis J. Kingston R.E.

Constitutive phosphorylation of HSF-1 by survival-promoting signaling pathways, such as GSK-3 and ERK, on serine residues Ser303 and Ser307, respectively, negatively regulates HSF-1 function, because mutations to alanine of either Ser303 alone or of both Ser303 and Ser307 cause constitutive transcriptional activation of HSF-1 (23.He B.

Transient overexpression of GSK-3, and to a lesser extent ERK, leads to a rapid diffusion of accumulated HSF-1 granules after heat shock, suggesting that sequential phosphorylation of HSF-1 by these two enzymes suppresses HSF-1 activity by perhaps forcing HSF-1 to disperse rapidly from the sites of transcription during recovery from heat shock (23.He B. Meng Y,-H. Mivechi N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6624-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of HSF-1 by these enzymes most likely holds HSF-1 in an inactive state under normal physiological growth conditions.The MAPKs respond to diverse stimuli and consist of sequential protein kinase cascades. MAPKs are activated via phosphorylation of specific threonine and tyrosine residues by dual specificity MAPKs, which are known as MEK/MKKs. MEK/MKKs are phosphorylated and activated by MEK kinases (MEKKs/MKKK) (27.Seger R.K. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3187) Google Scholar, 28.Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J.

JNK directs a wide range of cellular processes under physiological and pathological conditions, including the induction of apoptosis (38.Wilkinson M.G.

JNKs preferentially phosphorylate sites containing the consensus sequence Pro-Xaa-(Ser/Thr)-Pro and sometimes requires the interaction with specific sequences that are prerequisite for efficient phosphorylation. A short region, known as the Δ domain, or D domain, that is conserved in a number of transcription factors in the TCF family, appears to be required for this interaction. However, different amino acid residues in the D domain are critical for ERK and JNK binding (36.Gupta S. Cambell D. Derijard B. Davis R.J.

Both ERK and JNK bind to a conserved residue on HSF-1 known as the D domain, and deletion of this domain reduces the ability of ERK and JNK to phosphorylate HSF-1in vitro. Furthermore, the mutation of ERK or JNK phosphorylation sites on an HSF-1-GFP fusion protein causes HSF-1 to form granules, after heat shock, that remain in the nucleus for longer periods of time than the wild type HSF-1-GFP. These studies suggest that HSF-1 is the target of phosphorylation and suppression by two signaling pathways, ERK, which is involved in cell survival, and JNK, which is involved in cell death.DISCUSSIONThere is accumulating evidence that HSF-1 transcription is down-regulated by multiple mechanisms. These repression mechanisms include interaction with HSP-70, HSP-90, HSBP1, and perhaps other members of the HSF family (52.Zou j. Guo Y. Guettouche T. Smith D.F. Voellmy R. Cell. 1998; 94: 471-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar, 53.Satyal S.H. Chen D. Fox S.G. Kramer J.M. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1962-1974Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 54.Morimoto R.L. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3788-3796Crossref PubMed Scopus (1518) Google Scholar). HSF-1 is also phosphorylated extensively, and therefore, it appears to be regulated by multiple protein kinases, whose identity have not all been established with certainty. The mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK and JNK recognize their substrates via a small domain known as the D domain. Deletion of this domain leads to severe reduction of the ability of these enzymes to phosphorylate their substrates (41.Kallunki T. Su B. Tsigelny I.T. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Moore G. Davis R.J. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2996-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 42.Yang S.-H. Yates P.R. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In this study we have shown evidence that HSF-1 also contains sequences that are normally represented in the D domain where both ERK and JNK can bind. Furthermore, deletion of this domain reduces the ability of these enzymes to phosphorylate HSF-1 efficiently. Although both enzymes bind HSF-1 in vitro, we could specifically demonstrate ERK association with the hyperphosphorylated form of HSF-1 in vivo immediately after heat shock. However, ERK does not appear to be bound consistently to HSF-1 under physiological growth conditions. Interestingly, as the immunoblots in Fig. 2 A suggest, ERK associates with the hyperphosphorylated form of HSF-1 after heat shock. Under similar experimental conditions, we were unable to consistently detect JNK association with HSF-1 in vivo (data not shown); however, in some immunoprecipitation experiments JNK was found to interact with what appears to be the high molecular weight, hyperphosphorylated form of HSF-1 in both untreated and heated cells. The inconsistency in detecting JNK association with HSF-1 could be their transient association with each other, or it could be that JNK may bind to HSF-1 for a short time after some recovery time after heat shock and not during the times that were tested here. The reason why ERK binds HSF-1 immediately after heat shock is unclear. However, ERK could bind but phosphorylate HSF-1 at later times when its phosphorylation site(s) becomes available, or because GSK-3β and ERK phosphorylation of HSF-1 have been postulated to occur sequentially, the limiting step may be GSK-3β phosphorylation of HSF-1, which could take place at a later time after heat shock. Our results also show that both JNK and ERK can bind HSF-1 in vitro and that deletion of the amino acid residues 203–224 in the HSF-1 protein reduces the ability of JNK1 and also JNK2, ERK1, and ERK2 to phosphorylate HSF-1. As we show in the data presented in Fig. 2 G, the region of HSF-1 that is important for ERK and JNK binding also encodes the nuclear localization signal. This region, therefore, could be masked under normal physiological growth conditions by the interaction of the NH2-terminal leucine zippers 1, 2, and 3 with the COOH-terminal leucine zipper 4 as had previously been suggested (55.Rabindran S.K. Raymond R.I. Haroun I. Clos J. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Once HSF-1 protein is activated and becomes unfolded ERK and JNK could then bind to HSF-1.Previous experiments have shown that the ERK phosphorylation site on HSF-1 is Ser307, and sequential phosphorylation by ERK and GSK-3 suppresses HSF-1 transcriptional activity (23.He B. Meng Y,-H. Mivechi N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6624-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 25.Chu B. Soncin F. Price B.D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30847-30857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). JNK suppresses HSF-1 transcriptional activity by a similar mechanism as that observed for ERK and GSK-3, namely by causing HSF-1 to disperse from the sites of transcription more rapidly after heat shock. The paradox is how HSF-1 is suppressed by two opposing signaling pathways, namely, ERK and GSK-3, which are survival promoting signaling pathways, and JNK, a signaling pathway that is involved in apoptosis (Fig.8). ERK, GSK, and JNK could cooperate to repress HSF-1 transcriptional activity for two reasons. First, because ERK and GSK are constitutively active under physiological growth conditions and their activities are only moderately enhanced by heat shock, they could repress HSF-1 constitutively, under physiological growth conditions, and gradually, during the recovery from heat shock for continuation of cell growth and survival. This is because retaining activated HSF-1 molecules could interfere with cell growth because of the partial or complete shut down of newly synthesized mRNAs and general protein synthesis that often accompanies the presence of large amounts of activated HSF-1, e.g. after heat shock. The gradual repression of HSF-1 in cells destined to survive after heat shock could result in accumulation of sufficient amounts of HSPs and protection of cells against further injury. Second, JNK is not normally active under physiological growth conditions, but it can be activated to high levels, and its activity is sustained for many hours after a severe heat shock. This could cause rapid repression of HSF-1 transcriptional activity and insufficient amounts of HSPs accumulation. Thus, damaged proteins remain unrepaired, and cells proceed into apoptosis.In conclusion, we show evidence that JNK binds HSF-1 in its conserved domain and phosphorylates HSF-1 in its regulatory domain. Phosphorylation of HSF-1 by JNK leads to suppression of its transcriptional activity. In vertebrates, multiple heat shock transcription factors (HSFs)1 bind to conserved regulatory DNA sequences known as heat shock elements (HSEs) (1.Wu C.

Philips B. Morimoto R.I. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2117-2127Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In response to chemical, environmental, and physiological stresses including heat shock, HSFs induce the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs), which are molecular chaperones (6.Wu Y. Barnabas N. Russo I.H. Russo J. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 1069-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 7.Morimoto R.I. Science. 1993; 259: 1409-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Accumulation of HSPs following heat shock or other stresses are crucial for cells to survive further injury as they confer protection to different cellular components; they also prevent apoptosis (8.Li G.C.

So far, four HSFs have been identified, and the regulation of each is complex and not entirely understood (11.Nakai A. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell.

Among the various HSFs, the mammalian HSF-1 is regulated by phosphorylation (15.Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 16.Mivechi N.F. Murai T. Hahn G.M. J. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 54: 186-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 17.Baler R.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2782-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and transcriptional activities of most mammalian transcription factors are regulated by phosphorylation. In many cases, multiple protein kinases can act on a single transcription factor (19.Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1993; 50: 823-829Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (772) Google Scholar). In the case of mammalian HSF-1, it appears to also be targeted by multiple protein kinases because it is phosphorylated under normal physiological growth conditions as well as after heat shock (15.Sarge K.D. Murphy S.P. Morimoto R.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1392-1407Crossref PubMed Scopus (743) Google Scholar, 20.Mivechi N.F. Giaccia A.J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 8749-8755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Following activation by heat shock, HSF-1 appears at the sites of transcription as several intensely staining punctate granules that become as large as 1.5–2.5 μm (23.He B. Meng Y,-H. Mivechi N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6624-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 24.Cotto J.J. Fox S.G. Morimoto R.I. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 2925-2934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional role of phosphorylation in relation to HSF-1 granule formation and the signaling pathways controlling HSF-1 activity is not entirely clear. Phosphorylated forms of HSF-1 protein have been extensively studied by phosphopeptide mapping as well as mutational analysis. The data suggest that HSF-1 is phosphorylated on multiple serine residues and, perhaps, a threonine residue (18.Knauf U. Newton E.M. Kyriakis J. Kingston R.E. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2782-2793Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar, 22.Xia W. Guo Y. Vilaboa N. Zuo J. Voellmy R. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2107-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Constitutive phosphorylation of HSF-1 by survival-promoting signaling pathways, such as GSK-3 and ERK, on serine residues Ser303 and Ser307, respectively, negatively regulates HSF-1 function, because mutations to alanine of either Ser303 alone or of both Ser303 and Ser307 cause constitutive transcriptional activation of HSF-1 (23.He B. Meng Y,-H. Mivechi N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6624-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 25.Chu B. Soncin F. Price B.D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2107-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Transient overexpression of GSK-3, and to a lesser extent ERK, leads to a rapid diffusion of accumulated HSF-1 granules after heat shock, suggesting that sequential phosphorylation of HSF-1 by these two enzymes suppresses HSF-1 activity by perhaps forcing HSF-1 to disperse rapidly from the sites of transcription during recovery from heat shock (23.He B. Meng Y,-H. Mivechi N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6624-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of HSF-1 by these enzymes most likely holds HSF-1 in an inactive state under normal physiological growth conditions. The MAPKs respond to diverse stimuli and consist of sequential protein kinase cascades. MAPKs are activated via phosphorylation of specific threonine and tyrosine residues by dual specificity MAPKs, which are known as MEK/MKKs. MEK/MKKs are phosphorylated and activated by MEK kinases (MEKKs/MKKK) (27.Seger R.K. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3187) Google Scholar, 28.Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J.

There are three well characterized MAPK pathways: ERK1/ERK2, also known as p42/p44 MAPKs (29.Boulton T.G. Nye S.H. Robbins D.J. Ip N.Y. Radziejewska E. Morgenbesser S.D. Depinho R.A. Panayotatos N.

HSF-1 is also phosphorylated extensively, and therefore, it appears to be regulated by multiple protein kinases, whose identity have not all been established with certainty. The mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK and JNK recognize their substrates via a small domain known as the D domain. Deletion of this domain leads to severe reduction of the ability of these enzymes to phosphorylate their substrates (41.Kallunki T. Su B. Tsigelny I.T. Sluss H.K. Derijard B. Moore G. Davis R.J. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2996-3007Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 42.Yang S.-H. Yates P.R. Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. Sharrocks A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). In this study we have shown evidence that HSF-1 also contains sequences that are normally represented in the D domain where both ERK and JNK can bind. Furthermore, deletion of this domain reduces the ability of these enzymes to phosphorylate HSF-1 efficiently. Although both enzymes bind HSF-1 in vitro, we could specifically demonstrate ERK association with the hyperphosphorylated form of HSF-1 in vivo immediately after heat shock. However, ERK does not appear to be bound consistently to HSF-1 under physiological growth conditions. Interestingly, as the immunoblots in Fig. 2 A suggest, ERK associates with the hyperphosphorylated form of HSF-1 after heat shock. Under similar experimental conditions, we were unable to consistently detect JNK association with HSF-1 in vivo (data not shown); however, in some immunoprecipitation experiments JNK was found to interact with what appears to be the high molecular weight, hyperphosphorylated form of HSF-1 in both untreated and heated cells. The inconsistency in detecting JNK association with HSF-1 could be their transient association with each other, or it could be that JNK may bind to HSF-1 for a short time after some recovery time after heat shock and not during the times that were tested here. The reason why ERK binds HSF-1 immediately after heat shock is unclear. However, ERK could bind but phosphorylate HSF-1 at later times when its phosphorylation site(s) becomes available, or because GSK-3β and ERK phosphorylation of HSF-1 have been postulated to occur sequentially, the limiting step may be GSK-3β phosphorylation of HSF-1, which could take place at a later time after heat shock. Our results also show that both JNK and ERK can bind HSF-1 in vitro and that deletion of the amino acid residues 203–224 in the HSF-1 protein reduces the ability of JNK1 and also JNK2, ERK1, and ERK2 to phosphorylate HSF-1. As we show in the data presented in Fig. 2 G, the region of HSF-1 that is important for ERK and JNK binding also encodes the nuclear localization signal. This region, therefore, could be masked under normal physiological growth conditions by the interaction of the NH2-terminal leucine zippers 1, 2, and 3 with the COOH-terminal leucine zipper 4 as had previously been suggested (55.Rabindran S.K. Raymond R.I. Haroun I. Clos J. Wisniewski J. Wu C. Science. 1993; 259: 230-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Once HSF-1 protein is activated and becomes unfolded ERK and JNK could then bind to HSF-1.Previous experiments have shown that the ERK phosphorylation site on HSF-1 is Ser307, and sequential phosphorylation by ERK and GSK-3 suppresses HSF-1 transcriptional activity (23.He B. Meng Y,-H. Mivechi N.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6624-6633Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 25.Chu B. Soncin F. Price B.D. Stevenson M.A. Calderwood S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30847-30857Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). JNK suppresses HSF-1 transcriptional activity by a similar mechanism as that observed for ERK and GSK-3, namely by causing HSF-1 to disperse from the sites of transcription more rapidly after heat shock. The paradox is how HSF-1 is suppressed by two opposing signaling pathways, namely, ERK and GSK-3, which are survival promoting signaling pathways, and JNK, a signaling pathway that is involved in apoptosis (Fig.8). ERK, GSK, and JNK could cooperate to repress HSF-1 transcriptional activity for two reasons. First, because ERK and GSK are constitutively active under physiological growth conditions and their activities are only moderately enhanced by heat shock, they could repress HSF-1 constitutively, under physiological growth conditions, and gradually, during the recovery from heat shock for continuation of cell growth and survival. This is because retaining activated HSF-1 molecules could interfere with cell growth because of the partial or complete shut down of newly synthesized mRNAs and general protein synthesis that often accompanies the presence of large amounts of activated HSF-1, e.g. after heat shock. The gradual repression of HSF-1 in cells destined to survive after heat shock could result in accumulation of sufficient amounts of HSPs and protection of cells against further injury. Second, JNK is not normally active under physiological growth conditions, but it can be activated to high levels, and its activity is sustained for many hours after a severe heat shock. This could cause rapid repression of HSF-1 transcriptional activity and insufficient amounts of HSPs accumulation. Thus, damaged proteins remain unrepaired, and cells proceed into apoptosis.In conclusion, we show evidence that JNK binds HSF-1 in its conserved domain and phosphorylates HSF-1 in its regulatory domain. Phosphorylation of HSF-1 by JNK leads to suppression of its transcriptional activity. There is accumulating evidence that HSF-1 transcription is down-regulated by multiple mechanisms. These repression mechanisms include interaction with HSP-70, HSP-90, HSBP1, and perhaps other members of the HSF family (52.Zou j. Guo Y. Guettouche T. Smith D.F. Voellmy R.

In conclusion, we show evidence that JNK binds HSF-1 in its conserved domain and phosphorylates HSF-1 in its regulatory domain.

Sterol 12α-hydroxylase/CYP8b1 is the specific enzyme required for cholic acid synthesis. The levels of this enzyme determine the ratio of cholic acid to chenodeoxycholic acid and thus the hydrophobicity of the circulating bile acid pool. Expression of the 12α-hydroxylase gene is tightly down-regulated by hydrophobic bile acids. In this study, we report the characterization of two DNA elements that are required for both the 12α-hydroxylase promoter activity and bile acid-mediated regulation. Mutation of these elements suppresses 12α-hydroxylase promoter activity. Mutations of any other part of the promoter do not alter substantially the promoter activity or alter regulation by bile acids relative to the wild type promoter. These two DNA elements bind α1-fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF), a member of the nuclear receptor family. We also show that overexpression of FTF in a non-liver cell line activates the sterol 12α-hydroxylase promoter. These studies demonstrate the crucial role of FTF for the expression and regulation of a critical gene in the bile acid biosynthetic pathways.

Because nearly 50% of the body cholesterol is catabolized to bile acids, this pathway plays an important role in the cholesterol homeostasis of mammals. Current evidence suggests a decreased bile acid output as the major contributing factor in the production of lithogenic bile. This leads to an abnormal ratio of cholesterol to bile acids and lecithin, which is a major risk factor for cholesterol gallstone formation (1.Turley S.D. Dietschy J.M. Arias I. Popper H. Schachter D. Shafritz D.A. The Liver: Biology and Pathology. Raven Press, New York1982: 467-492Google Scholar). Cholesterol conversion to bile acids occurs via the “classic” (neutral) or the “alternative” (acidic) bile acid biosynthesis pathways (2.Javitt N.B. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA)1 are the end products of these pathways (Fig. 1) and the major primary bile acids found in most vertebrates. Cholic acid is hydroxylated at position 12α, whereas CDCA is not. There are three enzymes that play major regulatory roles in these two pathways. Cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase/CYP7a1 (7α-hydroxylase) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the classic pathway. Sterol 27-hydroxylase/CYP27 is the first enzyme in the alternative pathway. Sterol 12α-hydroxylase/CYP8b1 (12α-hydroxylase) is the specific enzyme for cholic acid synthesis and determines the ratio of cholic acid to chenodeoxycholic acid and thus the hydrophobicity of the circulating pool. The altered ratio of cholic to CDCA has been postulated to play a role in cholesterol gallstone formation (3.Shaw R. Elliot W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7177-7182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Suppression of 12α-hydroxylase by specific inhibitors has been suggested as a possible therapeutic strategy for dissolution of cholesterol gallstone (3.Shaw R. Elliot W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7177-7182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because chenodeoxycholic acid is a more potent suppressor of HMG-CoA reductase and 7α-hydroxylase than cholic acid (3.Shaw R. Elliot W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7177-7182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Heuman D.M. Hylemon P.B. Vlahcevic Z.R. J. Lipid. Res. 1989; 30: 1161-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the relative activity of 12α-hydroxylase may play an important role in the regulation of hepatic cholesterol homeostasis. The alteration of cholic/CDCA ratio affects biliary cholesterol and phospholipid secretion, thus altering intestinal cholesterol absorption and receptor-mediated lipoprotein uptake by the hepatocyte (4.Heuman D.M. Hylemon P.B. Vlahcevic Z.R. J. Lipid. Res. 1989; 30: 1161-1171Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is well documented that bile acids exert negative feedback regulation on their own synthesis (5.Carey M.C. Cahalene M.J. Arias I.M. Jakoby W.B. Popper H. Schachter D. Shafritz D.A. The Liver: Biology and Pathobiology. Raven Press, New York1988: 573-616Google Scholar). Interruption of the enterohepatic circulation, by biliary diversion or by feeding bile acid-binding resins (cholestyramine), enhances cholesterol and bile acid synthesis (6.Danielsson J. Einarsson K. Johansson G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1967; 2: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Conversely, feeding bile acids suppresses bile acid and cholesterol synthesis (7.Dietschy J.M. Wilson J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1970; 282: 1128-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Bile acids negatively regulate the transcription of the 7α-hydroxylase gene, which controls output from the classic pathway (8.Ramirez M.I. Karaoglu D. Haro D. Barillas C. Bashirzadeh R. Gil G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2809-2821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two bile acid response elements have been localized within the 5′-flanking region of the rat gene (9.Stroup D. Crestani M. Chiang J.Y.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: G508-G517PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Chiang J.Y.L. Stroup D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17502-17507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but the factors that mediate regulation have not been characterized. It remains to be demonstrated whether these elements are indeed involved in this regulation. Similarly, bile acids also down-regulate transcription of the sterol 27-hydroxylase gene (11.Vlahcevic Z.R. Jairath S.K. Heuman D.M. Stravitz R.T. Hylemon P.B. Avadhani N.G. Pandak W.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G646-G652PubMed Google Scholar), and it has been reported that hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF-1) is involved in this regulation (12.Rao Y.P. Vlahcevic Z.R. Stravitz R.T. Mallonee D.H. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. Hylemon P.B. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1999; 70: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms involved in that regulation are not well defined. More recently, it has been shown that a transcriptional factor, named the CYP7A promoter-binding factor (CPF), is required for the expression of the 7α-hydroxylase gene (13.Nitta M. Ku S. Brown C. Okamoto A.Y. Shan B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6660-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). This factor is a member of the Ftz-F1 family of the class IV orphan nuclear receptor superfamily (14.Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. et al.Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6110) Google Scholar). CPF binds to the region of the 7α-hydroxylase promoter previously characterized as a bile acid response element (10.Chiang J.Y.L. Stroup D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17502-17507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which suggests that CPF might play a role in the bile acid-mediated down-regulation of 7α-hydroxylase transcription. The cDNAs and genes encoding the rabbit, rat, and human 12α-hydroxylase enzyme have been cloned (15.Andersson U. Yang Y.Z. Björkhem I. Einarsson C. Eggertsen G. Gafvels M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1438: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 16.Eggertsen G. Olin M. Andersson U. Ishida H. Kubota S. Hellman U. Okuda K.-I. Björkhem I. J. Biol.

Eggertsen G. Genomics. 1999; 56: 184-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and studies of the molecular basis of its regulation are now feasible. It is expressed exclusively in the liver, since it corresponds to a liver-specific process. Recently, Vlahcevic et al. (18.Vlahcevic Z.R. Eggertsen G. Björkhem I. Hylemon P.B. Redford K. Pandak W.M. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 599-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) showed that expression of the 12α-hydroxylase gene is tightly regulated in a similar fashion to the 7α-hydroxylase gene. Cholestyramine-fed rats contained approximately 2-fold more 12α-hydroxylase mRNA than control rats, whereas deoxycholate- or cholate-fed rats had undetectable levels of 12α-hydroxylase mRNA (at least 10-fold less than controls). Interestingly, cholesterol feeding decreased the amount of 12α-hydroxylase mRNA by about 2-fold. Similar regulation was observed for both enzymatic and transcriptional activity, which indicates that both bile acids and cholesterol regulate the expression of the 12α-hydroxylase gene mainly at the transcriptional level. In this study, we have characterized the 12α-hydroxylase promoter. We have localized two DNA elements that are required for both expression of the 12α-hydroxylase promoter and bile acid-mediated regulation. These elements bind α1-fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF) (19.Galarneau L. Pare J.F. Allard D. Hamel D. Levesque L. Tugwood J.D. Green S. Bélanger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3853-3865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a member of the Ftz-F1 family of receptors. Rat FTF is the ortholog of mouse liver receptor homolog 1 2J. D. Tugwood, I. Issemann, and S. Green, GenBankTM accession number M81385. and human PHR-1 (21.Becker-Andre M. Andre E. DeLamarter J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 1371-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). We have also shown that when FTF is expressed in a non-liver cell line, the 12α-hydroxylase promoter becomes active, demonstrating the critical role of FTF for 12α-hydroxylase promoter activity. These studies demonstrate the crucial role of FTF in the bile acid biosynthetic pathway. Reagents used in DNA cloning and sequencing were from New England Biolabs, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, U.S. Biochemical Corp., or Life Technologies, Inc. Common laboratory chemicals were from Fisher, Sigma, or Bio-Rad. The luciferase promoterless vector, pGL3-Basic, was purchased from Promega. Oligonucleotides were prepared in the Medical College of Virginia DNA Synthesis Facility by the phosphoramidite method on an automated DNA synthesizer. pCI-FTF, an expression plasmid that contains the human FTF cDNA in the expression vector pCI (Promega), was a generous gift from Dr. Bélanger (19.Galarneau L.

Biol. 1996; 16: 3853-3865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pCMX, a plasmid for expression in mammalian cells and in vitro, contains the cytomegalovirus and the T7 promoters and was a gift from Dr. Ronald M. Evans. Anti-FTF antibodies were a gift from Dr. David W. Russell and were raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 180–1197 of the DNA binding domain. Standard recombinant DNA procedures were carried out essentially as described (8.Ramirez M.I. Karaoglu D. Haro D. Barillas C. Bashirzadeh R. Gil G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2809-2821Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was done by the dideoxy chain termination method using DNA fragments subcloned into M13 vectors or with double-stranded clones and the universal primer or sequence-specific primers with reagents from U.S. Biochemical Corp. A rat genomic library was obtained from CLONTECH. The library was plated and screened with a doubled-stranded probe made by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and contained a 200-nt fragment from the 5′-end of the rabbit 12α-hydroxylase cDNA. The polymerase chain reaction primers were synthesized based on published DNA sequence (22.Teixeira J. Gil G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21030-21036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Southern blot analysis was done to characterize the λ clone. About 3 kilobases was sequenced by the dideoxy method. PGL3-R12α-865 was prepared by placing a 903-nucleotide SacI–SacI fragment containing nucleotides −865 to +37 into the SacI site of pGL3-Basic (Promega). The three 5′-deletion constructs PGL3-R12α-289, PGL3-R12α-163, and PGL3-R12α-106 were prepared by polymerase chain reaction using a specific 5′ primer and a common 3′ primer corresponding to nucleotides 20–37. Mutation constructs were generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis in M13 (23.Subramanian A. Teixeira J. Wang J. Gil G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4672-4682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. HepG2 and CV-1 cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. Both cell types were transfected with Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.), using 1.5 μg of total DNA in 35-mm plates. HepG2 were transfected with 25 ng of test plasmid and 5 ng of pCMV-Gal (a plasmid containing the human cytomegalovirus promoter in from of the bacteria galactosidase gene) to normalize for transfection efficiencies. CV-1 cells were transfected with 200 ng of test plasmid, 50 ng of pCMV-Gal, and the indicated amounts of pCI-FTF, an expression plasmid that contains the FTF cDNA driven by the cytomegalovirus promoter. After 16 h, the DNA was removed, and where indicated, 100 μm CDCA was added. Cells were harvested 48 h later, and luciferase and β-galactosidase assays were performed with a kit from Tropix (Bedford, MA), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Average values are for the number of experiments indicated. Transcription/translation of cDNAs encoding FTF or of the growth hormone receptor (GHR) as a control was performed using the TNT T7-coupled rabbit reticulocyte lysate system according to the manufacturer's protocol (Promega). HepG2 nuclear extracts were prepared as indicated (24.Subramanian A. Wang J. Gil G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 29: 2173-2178Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). DNA binding reactions were set up in 50 mm KCl, 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 0.2 mm EDTA, 4% Ficoll, 1.0 μg of poly (dI-dC), 4 μl of the translated protein, and a 1500-fold molar excess of an irrelevant single-stranded DNA, in a final volume of 20 μl on ice. After a 15-min incubation, 320 fmol of the indicated32P-labeled DNA probes (∼2 × 105 cpm) were added. All probes were adjusted to the same specific radioactivity. After incubation for 20 min on ice, samples were loaded onto a 4.5% polyacrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis at 4 °C. Gels were dried and exposed to XAR-5 (Eastman Kodak Co.). For supershift experiments, 1 μl of the crude serum was used. The DNA sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the 12α-hydroxylase gene is shown in Fig.2. The transcriptional initiation site was located by primer extension techniques (data not shown) and is numbered +1. This sequence contains a TATA box-like element, two consensus binding sites for HNF-3, a liver-specific DNA-binding protein (16.Eggertsen G. Olin M. Andersson U. Ishida H. Kubota S. Hellman U. Okuda K.-I. Björkhem I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32269-32275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and two sterol regulatory elements (SREs) that are implicated in cholesterol-mediated regulation of the transcription of several genes (17.Gafvels M. Olin M. Chowdhary B.P. Raudsepp T. Andersson U. Persson B. Jansson M. Björkhem I. Eggertsen G. Genomics. 1999; 56: 184-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). One stretch of DNA located between nucleotides −63 and −48 contains two potential sites for the liver-specific nuclear receptor FTF (19.Galarneau L. Pare J.F. Allard D. Hamel D. Levesque L. Tugwood J.D. Green S. Bélanger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3853-3865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To functionally characterize the 12α-hydroxylase promoter, we prepared a chimeric gene (pGL3-R12α-865, as shown in Fig.3) by fusing theSacI–SacI fragment (Fig. 2), which contains 865 base pairs of the 5′-flanking region and 33 base pairs of 5′-untranslated region, to the coding region of the luciferase gene. We then used HepG2 cells as recipient cells to transfect this chimeric gene. After transfection, cells were treated with or without 100 μm CDCA, which was shown to suppress expression of the endogenous gene in primary hepatocytes (data not shown), mimicking the bile acid-mediated regulation that has been described in vivo (18.Vlahcevic Z.R. Eggertsen G. Björkhem I. Hylemon P.B. Redford K. Pandak W.M. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 599-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cells were harvested for luciferase and galactosidase activities as explained under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 3, pGL3-R12α-865 had promoter activity (100-fold above background levels) that was regulated approximately 5-fold upon the addition of CDCA. To narrow down the promoter region involved in both transcriptional activity and bile acid-mediated regulation, we made the three 5′-deletion constructs shown in Fig. 3. All three constructs showed regulated activity, indicating that all of the DNA elements required for both promoter activity and bile acid-mediated regulation are located in the first 106 nucleotides of the 12α-hydroxylase promoter. To further characterize the 12α-hydroxylase promoter, we mutated the first 106 nucleotides in blocks of approximately 20 nucleotides each as shown in Fig. 2 (brackets A–G). The results of these experiments are shown in Fig.4 A, and the actual mutations introduced in mutants D, E, and F are shown in Fig. 4 B. All mutants exhibited promoter activity and bile acid-mediated regulation, except when nucleotides −62 to −49 were mutated. This region contains two putative elements with homology to the rat FTF site, a member of the Drosophila orphan receptor fushi tarazu F1 (Ftz-F1) (25.Lavorgna G. Ueda H. Clos J. Wu C. Science. 1991; 252: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), and we named them FTF sites. These elements are also homologous to the recently described CPF site for the 7α-hydroxylase gene (26.Wang H. Chen J. Hollister K. Sowers L.C. Forman B.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 543-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar), another nuclear receptor of the same family. These homologies are shown in Fig. 5.Figure 5Homology between the 12α-hydroxylase promoter FTF sites and other homologous binding sites. Nucleotides −63 to −48 from the rat 12α-hydroxylase promoter are shown at the top, with the two FTF sites boxed. These two sites are aligned with the rat FTF site (19.Galarneau L. Pare J.F. Allard D. Hamel D. Levesque L. Tugwood J.D. Green S. Bélanger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3853-3865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); the Drosophila Ftz-F1 consensus binding site (25.Lavorgna G. Ueda H. Clos J. Wu C. Science. 1991; 252: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar); and the human, rat, and hamster 7α-hydroxylase CPF sites (13.Nitta M. Ku S. Brown C. Okamoto A.Y. Shan B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6660-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Based on these homologies, we hypothesized that there are two FTF elements within the 12α-hydroxylase promoter located at positions −63 to −55 and −56 to −48. The data in Fig. 4 A show that both mutants D and F, which have the two potential FTF sites independently mutated, and mutant E, which has both sites mutated, had very low, if detectable, activities. This suggests that both elements are required for activity. Fig. 6 shows that in vitrosynthesized FTF binds to the 12α-hydroxylase promoter (lanes 2 and 3). When in vitro made FTF was preincubated with antibodies raised against a peptide corresponding to the DNA binding domain of FTF, binding was mostly abolished (lane 5), demonstrating that the protein binding to the 12α-hydroxylase probe is in fact FTF. Preimmune serum did not produce any effect (lane 4). Mutation of 5 nucleotides (−62 to −58) within the first site diminished binding about 5-fold (lanes 7 and 8). Mutation of 4 nucleotides (−52 to −49) within the second putative site also diminished binding by about 5-fold (Fig. 6 A, lanes 13 and14). Mutation of 8 nucleotides (−56 to −49) that modifies both sites abolished binding completely (lanes 10and 11). As a negative control, we used in vitrosynthesized GHR (lanes 1, 6,9, and 12). To determine the specificity of the binding and if the 7α-hydroxylase CPF site binds to the same protein, we performed the competition experiment shown in Fig. 6 B. Wild type probe competed as expected (lanes 3–5). A probe made from the rat 7α-hydroxylase promoter sequence (−150 to −131) containing the described CPF site (13.Nitta M. Ku S. Brown C. Okamoto A.Y. Shan B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6660-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar) competed even better than the 12α-hydroxylase probe itself (lanes 6–8), suggesting that the 7α-hydroxylase CPF site has higher affinity for FTF than the 12α-hydroxylase sites. A mutated 12α-hydroxylase fragment (mutant E), with nucleotides mutated in both FTF sites, did not compete for binding (lanes 9–11), confirming the specificity of the binding. To demonstrate that the protein binding to the 12α-hydroxylase FTF sites exists in liver cells, HepG2 nuclear extracts were used for binding experiments (Fig. 6 C, lanes 7–9). The binding activity found in HepG2 cells was also inhibited by incubation with a specific antibody against FTF (lane 9), and the DNA-protein complexes formed exhibited mobility identical to that of the complex formed by in vitro made FTF (lanes 4–6). As a control, we used a probe from the rat 7α-hydroxylase promoter known to bind CPF, a highly homologous protein to FTF (13.Nitta M. Ku S. Brown C. Okamoto A.Y. Shan B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6660-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). Both in vitromade FTF and HepG2 nuclear extracts bind the 7α-hydroxylase probe, and that binding was specific as indicated by the fact that anti-FTF antibodies also prevented binding (Fig. 6 C, lanes 10–18). The 7α-hydroxylase probe binds FTF at higher affinity that the 12α-hydroxylase probe, in agreement with the competition experiments shown in Fig. 6 B. To further demonstrate the key role of FTF for 12α-hydroxylase promoter activity, we overexpressed FTF in the kidney cell line CV-1 (Fig. 7). Since 12α-hydroxylase is expressed only in the liver, pGL3-R12α-865 was inactive in CV-1 cells as expected. However, when we cotransfected pCI-FTF, pGL3-R12α-865 became active. The level of activation was nearly 13-fold when 200 ng of pCI-FTF was used. As a control, we used pGL3-Basic and pGL3-R12α-865 mutant E, which had no promoter activity in HepG2 cells (Fig. 4). The activities from these two plasmids were the same as pGL3-R12α-865 when no pCI-FTF was included in the transfection. Overexpression of FTF produced only a slight activation (2–3-fold) of both the promoterless plasmid pGL3-Basic and the pGL3-R12α-865 mutant E. For comparison, a construct containing the rat 7α-hydroxylase promoter was activated only 8-fold when 2-fold more pCI-FTF (400 ng) was cotransfected (data not shown), suggesting a greater activity of FTF for the 12α-hydroxylase promoter than the 7α-hydroxylase promoter. The data presented in this study demonstrate that FTF is a factor required for 12α-hydroxylase expression. Several lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, mutagenesis of either of its two binding sites abolished promoter activity completely in HepG2 cells (Fig. 4); therefore, both sites are required for promoter activity. Second, in vitro-made FTF binds specifically to these sites (Fig. 6), and the same binding activity was observed in nuclear extracts prepared from HepG2 cells. Third, expression of FTF in a non-liver cell line activates the 12α-hydroxylase promoter, which is otherwise inactive (Fig. 7). Additionally, this study also demonstrates that all of the DNA elements required for the bile acid-mediated regulation of 12α-hydroxylase promoter activity are located in the first 106 nucleotides of the 5′-flanking region (Fig. 3). The 12α-hydroxylase promoter sequence also has two other potential regulatory elements. Two putative HNF-3 sites are located at approximately nucleotides −455 and −385 (Fig. 2). HNF-3 sites are found in the promoter of some liver-specific genes and are required for the expression of those genes (27.Jackson D.A. Rowader K.E. Stevens K. Jiang C. Milos P. Zaret K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2401-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Additionally, two SRE sites are located at approximately nucleotides −315 and −328. SREs are regulatory elements found in cholesterol and fatty acid-regulated genes (28.Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11041-11048Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). However, neither the HNF-3 sites nor the SRE sites seem to be required for either promoter activity or regulation by bile acids, since deletion of these sites has very little effect, if any (Fig. 3). It is conceivable that the SRE sites are involved in the cholesterol-mediated regulation of 12α-hydroxylase transcription that has been observed in rats (18.Vlahcevic Z.R. Eggertsen G. Björkhem I. Hylemon P.B. Redford K. Pandak W.M. Gastroenterology. 2000; 118: 599-607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), although this was not the objective of the present studies. Sterol 12α-hydroxylase is the second gene involved in bile acid biosynthesis that has been shown to require a member of the Ftz-F1 family of the class IV orphan nuclear receptor superfamily for its expression. Recently, it has been shown that another member of the same family, CPF, is required for 7α-hydroxylase expression (13.Nitta M. Ku S. Brown C. Okamoto A.Y. Shan B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6660-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). CPF also activates the 12α-hydroxylase promoter. In transactivation experiments similar to these shown in Fig. 6, CPF also activated 12α-hydroxylase promoter activity, although to a lesser extent (data not shown). It is possible that several members of the Ftz-F1 family have similar activity on genes involved in bile acid biosynthesis. In fact, it has been shown that at least both CPF and CPF variant 1 (another member of the same family) were active on the 7α-hydroxylase promoter (13.Nitta M. Ku S. Brown C. Okamoto A.Y. Shan B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6660-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). This suggests a crucial role of this family of factors in the control of bile acid biosynthesis. An interesting issue is the apparent existence of two FTF binding sites within the 12α-hydroxylase promoter. These two FTF sites were located based on homology with other FTF sites, and they overlap by the last 2 nucleotides of the first site based on published consensus sequences (13.Nitta M. Ku S. Brown C. Okamoto A.Y. Shan B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6660-6665Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 19.Galarneau L. Pare J.F. Allard D. Hamel D. Levesque L. Tugwood J.D. Green S. Bélanger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3853-3865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Lavorgna G. Ueda H. Clos J. Wu C. Science. 1991; 252: 848-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Although DNA probes containing an individual mutation of either site still bind FTF weakly (Fig. 6 A), both sites are required for an active promoter (Fig. 4 A). Nuclear receptors of the Ftz-F1 family are known to bind as monomers (19.Galarneau L. Pare J.F. Allard D. Hamel D. Levesque L. Tugwood J.D. Green S. Bélanger L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3853-3865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and given the migration pattern of the protein-probe complex, only one protein molecule seemed to bind per probe molecule. Thus, mutant D, which has only the first site mutated (Fig. 4 B), has some binding capability (Fig. 6 A) but has no promoter activity (Fig.4 A). Mutant F, which has 4 nucleotides mutated within the second site, has a binding capability similar to that of mutant D (Fig.6 A) and has some promoter activity (Fig. 4 A), but much lower than wild type. Mutant E, which has 8 nucleotides mutated across both binding sites, lost all binding (Fig. 6 A) and promoter activity. The most likely explanation to this issue is that binding of FTF to the 12α-hydroxylase promoter site requires more nucleotides than the binding of FTF or homologous factors to other promoters, and in fact, there may be only one extended binding site. Whether the activity of FTF is regulated by small molecules in a way similar to most nuclear receptors is still unknown. Attempts in our laboratory to identify a bile acid molecule or derivative that could act as ligand and/or regulator of FTF have not been successful. It is possible that there is another unidentified factor of the same family that is specific for genes of the bile acid biosynthetic pathways and that this factor has a ligand binding activity for bile acids or a derivative. Besides the similarity between the 12α-hydroxylase and 7α-hydroxylase promoters in the requirement for FTF or a homologous factor such as CPF for its expression, these two genes seem to differ in the factors required for bile acid regulation of their transcription. In experiments using HepG2 cells and with CDCA, the 7α-hydroxylase promoter required exogenous farnesol X receptor in order to show bile acid-mediated regulation of its activity (20.Makishima M. Okamoto A.Y. Repa J.J. Tu H. Learned R.M. Luk A. Hull M.V. Lustig K.D. Mangelsdorf D.J. Shan B. Science. 1999; 284: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (2182) Google Scholar), whereas the 12α-hydroxylase promoter did not show this requirement (Figs. 3 and 4). Although this study was not specifically directed to study the factors involved in the bile acid-mediated regulation of 12α-hydroxylase expression, our data strongly suggest that FTF is also implicated in that regulation. This is based on the fact that only mutations within the FTF binding sites abolished regulation. All deletion promoter constructs (Fig. 3) and all block mutant constructs (Fig. 4) are regulated by bile acids except for the two constructs that abolished FTF binding. It could be argued that elimination of FTF binding renders the promoter inactive, and no conclusion could be drawn about its regulation. However, mutation of the rest of the promoter did not alter bile acid-mediated regulation, and therefore the FTF sites should be involved in the regulation either directly or indirectly. Whether the FTF binding sites or FTF itself is capable of interacting with a bile acid-regulated factor is still unknown. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the key role of FTF or its homologues in the regulation of bile acid biosynthesis and should help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms involved in the bile acid-mediated down-regulation of gene transcription, a process poorly understood to date.

P1− individuals normally express the P antigen (P1− is designated P2 when P antigen expression is demonstrated), but the rare Pk phenotype lacks the P antigen, while the rare p phenotype lack both P and Pk antigens (for reviews, see Refs. 3.Watkins W.M.

Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 4831-4837Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). In contrast, the P, Pk, and p antigens constitute intermediate steps in biosynthesis of globo-series glycolipids and give rise to P1k, P2k, and p phenotypes (9.Naiki M. Marcus D.M. Biochem. Biophys.

Although the rare Pk phenotype shows the same frequency of P1antigen expression as individuals expressing the P antigen, the p phenotype is always associated with lack of P1 antigen expression. Extensive studies of the chemistry, biosynthesis, and genetics of the P blood group system identified the antigens as being exclusively found on glycolipids, with the blood group specificity being synthesized by at least two distinct glycosyltransferase activities; UDP-galactose:β-d-galactosyl-β1-R 4-α-d-galactosyltransferase (α4Gal-T)1 activity(ies) for Pk and P1 syntheses and UDP-GalNAc:Gb33-β-N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity (EC2.4.1.79) for P synthesis (for reviews, see Refs. 6.Issitt P.D.

Several hypotheses have been proposed, including: (i) a model with two distinct functional genes being allelic or non-allelic, where the P1 gene encodes a broadly active α4Gal-T, the Pk gene encodes a restricted α4Gal-T, and a null allele encodes a non-functional protein; (ii) a model with two distinct non-allelic genes, where P1 encodes an α4Gal-T that can only synthesize P1 structures and the Pk encodes an α4Gal-T that only synthesize the Pk structure; and (iii) a model where one gene locus encodes an α4Gal-T that is modulated by an independent polymorphic gene product to synthesize both P1and Pk structures. Bailly et al. (11.Bailly P. Piller F. Gillard B. Veyrieres A. Marcus D. Cartron J.P. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 228: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) reported that kidney microsomal α4Gal-T activity from P1individuals does not compete for the two substrates used by P1 and Pk α4Gal-T activities, and no accumulative effect in P1 synthase activity was observed when mixing microsomal fractions from individuals of P1 and Pk groups. Based on this, Bailly and colleagues suggested the existence of two distinct genes, coding for one P1α4Gal-T with exclusive activity for neolacto-series substrates and one Pk α4Gal-T with exclusive activity for the globo-series substrate. Since p individuals lack the P1antigen, this model inferred that two independent genetic events inactivating both genes was responsible for the p phenotype. Several approaches to gain insight into the P blood group α4Gal-T gene(s) have been attempted. Purification of the mammalian enzymes has not been successful, but identification and cloning of a bacterial α4Gal-T involved in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis (12.Gotschlich E.C. J. Exp.

Previously, a bacterial α3-fucosyltransferase was identified in Helicobacter pylori using a short sequence motif conserved among mammalian α3-fucosyltransferases (14.Martin S.L. Edbrooke M.R.

BLAST analysis of gene data bases with the coding region of the α4Gal-T gene from Neisseria meningococcae resulted in identification of two human genes encoding putative type II transmembrane proteins with low sequence similarity to the bacterial gene. 2R. Steffensen, J. Wiels, E. P. Bennett, and H. Clausen, unpublished observation. The genes have open reading frames encoding 349 (EST cluster Hs.251809) and 371 (EST cluster Hs.82837) amino acid residues and are located at 8q24 and 3p21.1, respectively. Previously, we established Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B cells from two p individuals (15.Wiels J. Taga S. Tetaud C. Cedergren B. Nilsson B. Clausen H. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Only the gene at 3p21.1 was found to be expressed in the EBV-transformed p cells, as well as in Ramos cells known to have high Pk α4Gal-T activity. Sequencing of the coding region of the gene showed no mutations in p cells. Finally, expression of full coding or truncated, secreted constructs of either gene in insect cells failed to demonstrate glycosyltransferase activity with a large panel of substrates, including lactosylceramide, for Pk α4Gal-T activity. The P1 polymorphism is linked to 22q11.3-ter (16.McAlpine P.J. Kaita H. Lewis M. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1978; 22: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), whereas no information is available for the p phenotype. In the present report, we used BLAST searches of gene data bases with the coding region of a recently cloned human α4GlcNAc-transferase located at 3p14.3 (17.Nakayama J. Yeh J.C. Misra A.K. Ito S. Katsuyama T. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8991-8996Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) to identify a novel homologous gene located at 22q13.2. Expression of full coding constructs of the gene, designated α4Gal-T1, in insect cells revealed Pk synthase activity, but no P1activity was demonstrated. Sequence analysis of the coding region of α4Gal-T1 in P1 and P2 individuals did not reveal polymorphisms correlating with the P1P2blood group phenotypes. In contrast, a single homozygous missense mutation, M183K, was found in six Swedish individuals of the rare p type. tBLASTn analysis of the human genome survey sequences, unfinished high throughput genomic sequences, and dbEST data bases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) with the coding sequence of a human α4GlcNAc-transferase recently cloned by Nakayama et al. (17.Nakayama J. Yeh J.C. Misra A.K. Ito S. Katsuyama T. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8991-8996Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), produced a novel open reading frame of 1059 bp with significant similarity. The full coding sequence was available from BAC clone SC22CB-33B7 on chromosome 22 (GenBank™ accession no. Z82176) in a single exon. With the release of the sequence of chromosome 22, the mapping data are cB33B7.1 at 2.65055 × 107 to 2.65044 × 107flanked by diaphorase (NADH) and an unknown protein. Linkage analysis of the P1 polymorphism was originally performed with NADH-cytochromeb 5 reductase (16.McAlpine P.J. Kaita H. Lewis M. Cytogenet. Cell Genet. 1978; 22: 629-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Few ESTs cover the coding region (e.g. R45869), but the 3′-UTR is covered by EST Unigene cluster Hs.105956. Available ESTs are mainly derived from tonsil, prostate, and germ cell tumors. The sequence analysis was performed in three steps. Initially, the coding region of α4Gal-T1 from seven P1+, five P1−, and six p phenotype individuals were sequenced in full by direct sequencing of a genomic fragment of 1295 bp derived by PCR with primer pair HCRS122 (5′-CCAGCCTTGGCTCTGGCTGATG) and HCRS126 (5′-CCCGGTGGCAGCTCGGGCCTC) located downstream and upstream of the translational start and stop sites, respectively. The PCR products were sequenced in both directions using the primers HCRS122, HCRS126, HCRS1 (5′-ATCTCACTTCTGAGCTGC), and HCRS4 (5′-GTTGTAGTGGTCCACGAAGTC). Subsequently, the products from two individuals (194 and 321) homozygous for G109 and two (183 and 300) homozygous for A109, randomly selected were subjected to cloning into pBluescript KS+ (Stratagene) followed by sequencing of clones. Finally, a genotyping assay based onRcaI restriction enzyme digestion of a PCR product was developed for the identified A109G missense mutation allele. PCR was performed using primer pair HCRS133 (5′-AAGCTCCTGGTCTGATCTGG) and HCRS6 (5′-ACCGAGCACATGAACAGGAAGTT) (30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s), and a total of 31 P1+ and 51 P1− phenotyped individuals was typed. RcaI digestion cleaves the expected product (319 bp) of A109 in two fragments of 182 and 137 bp. The RcaI digestion of PCR products was confirmed by Southern analysis on 3 P1+ and 2 P1− individuals. Full coding constructs were prepared by genomic PCR using primer pair HCRS131 (5′-ACCATGTCCAAGCCCCCCGACCTC) and HCRS125 (5′-CATGAAAATGTACTTGTGAGGGG) and genomic DNA from phenotyped individuals with phenotypes P1+ (165) and p (4.Marcus D.M. Immunol. Ser. 1989; 43: 701-712PubMed Google Scholar) (see Table II for sequence). Three different full coding constructs were selected for expression: 67 (A109, T548, G903, G987), 45 (G109, T548, G903, A987), and p5 (A109, A548, G903, G987). The products were cloned into BamHI andEcoRI sites of pBluescript KS+, and subsequently into the insect cell expression vector pVL1393 (PharMingen), and sequenced in full. A truncated, secreted construct (amino acid residues 46–353) was prepared using primer pair HCRS124 (5′-CCCAAGGAGAAAGGGCAGCTC) and HCRS125 from a P1+ phenotype individual (165), and the sequence confirmed as described above. The products were cloned into the expression vector pAcGP67A (PharMingen). The variants of plasmids pVL-α4Gal-T1-full and pAcGP67-α4Gal-T1-sol were co-transfected with Baculo-GoldTM DNA (PharMingen), and virus amplified as described previously (18.Bennett E.P. Hassan H. Clausen H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17006-17012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Standard assays were performed in 50-μl reaction mixtures containing 25 mm cacodylate (pH 6.5), 10 mm MnCl2, 0.25% Triton X-100, 100 μm UDP-[14C]Gal (10,000 cpm/nmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the indicated concentrations of acceptor substrates (Sigma and Dextra Laboratories Ltd.) (see TableI for structures). The full coding constructs were assayed with 1% Triton X-100 homogenates of cells twice washed in phosphate-buffered saline or resuspended microsomal fractions.Table IISequence polymorphisms identified in the coding region of α4Gal-T1 in P1+, P1−, and p blood group individualsDonor no.Phenotypent 109 (Met37 → Val)nt 548 (Met183 → Lys)nt 903 (silent Pro585)nt 987 (silent Thr613)165P1+A/GTGA/G167P1+A/GTGA/G178P1+A/GTGA/G183aIndicates that the sequence obtained by direct sequencing of PCR products were confirmed on cloned products.P1+ATG/CG168P1+ATG/CG173P1+GTGA194aIndicates that the sequence obtained by direct sequencing of PCR products were confirmed on cloned products.P1+GTGA332P1−GTGA174P1−ATCG200P1−ATCG300aIndicates that the sequence obtained by direct sequencing of PCR products were confirmed on cloned products.P1−ATG/CG321aIndicates that the sequence obtained by direct sequencing of PCR products were confirmed on cloned products.P1−GTGA1pAAGA/G2pAAGG3pAAGG4pAAGG5pAAGG6pAAGGa Indicates that the sequence obtained by direct sequencing of PCR products were confirmed on cloned products. Open table in a new tab The three full coding constructs, 67, 45, and p5, were cloned into pDR2 (CLONTECH). Insert was excised from pBKs with BamHI/XhoI and inserted into theBamHI/SalI sites of pDR2. Transient transfection of 5 × 106 Namalwa cells with 20 μg of cDNA was done by double-pulse electroporation using an Easy-cell ject+ (Eurogentec). Expression of CD77/Pk antigen was evaluated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis on a FACSCalibur (Beckton-Dickinson) using 1A4 monoclonal antibody (19.Wiels J. Kishimoto T. Leukocyte Typing VI. Garland Publishing Inc., London1997: 175-177Google Scholar). For product characterization, 2 mg of CDH was glycosylated with a microsomal fraction of High Five cells infected with pVL-α4Gal-T1-full (67) using thin layer chromatography to monitor reaction progress. The reaction products were purified on an octadecyl-silica cartridge (Bakerbond, J.T. Baker), deuterium exchanged by repeated addition of CDCl3-CD3OD 2:1, sonication, and evaporation under dry nitrogen, and then dissolved in 0.5 ml of Me2SO-d 6, 2% D2O (20.Dabrowski J. Hanfland P. Egge H. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) (containing 0.03% tetramethylsilane as chemical shift reference) for NMR analysis. One-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were acquired at 35 °C on a Varian Inova 600 MHz spectrometer; 1200 free induction decays were accumulated, with solvent suppression by presaturation pulse during the relaxation delay. Spectra were interpreted by comparison to those of relevant glycosphingolipid standards acquired under virtually identical conditions, as well as to previously published data for which a somewhat different temperature (65 °C) was employed (20.Dabrowski J. Hanfland P. Egge H. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 21.Kannagi R. Levery S.B. Ishigami F. Hakomori S. Shevinsky L.H. Knowles B.B. Solter D. J. Biol.

The probe was random primer-labeled using [α32P]dCTP and a Strip-EZ DNA labeling kit (Ambion). Multiple tissue northern (MTN-H12) blot was obtained fromCLONTECH. Eight human cell lines (Ramos, MutuI, BL2, Namalwa, Remb1, 8866, T51, and K562) were analyzed because Pk synthase activity and antigen expression have been characterized previously (22.Taga S. Tetaud C. Mangeney M. Tursz T. Wiels J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1254: 56-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 23.Taga S. Mangeney M. Tursz T. Wiels J. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 61: 261-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was extracted from cell lines using the RNeasy Midi kit (Qiagen SA). Nakayama et al. (17.Nakayama J. Yeh J.C. Misra A.K. Ito S. Katsuyama T. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8991-8996Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) recently reported the cloning of a novel human α4GlcNAc-transferase responsible for the synthesis of the structures GlcNAcα1–4Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1-R and GlcNAcα1–4Galβ1–3GalNAcα1-R. The gene was mapped to chromosome 3p14.3. Since this is the first mammalian glycosyltransferase gene available that forms an α1–4 linkage, we hypothesized that it would represent one member of a family of homologous glycosyltransferase genes. A characteristic feature of homologous glycosyltransferase genes is that different members may encode enzymes which have different donor or acceptor sugar specificities, but the nature of the linkage formed is often retained (24.Amado M. Almeida R. Schwientek T. Clausen H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1473: 35-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). BLAST analysis of data bases using the coding region of the α4GlcNAc-transferase identified a sequenced BAC clone containing an open reading frame of 1059 bp. The coding region depicts a type II transmembrane protein of 353 amino acids with 35% overall sequence similarity to human α4GlcNAc-T (Figs.1 and 2). The two genes show conservation of a DXD motif (25.Wiggins C.A.R. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar), and spacings of five cysteine residues. The predicted coding region of α4Gal-T1 has a single initiation codon in agreement with Kozak's rule (26.Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which precedes a sequence encoding a potential hydrophobic transmembrane segment (Fig. 1).Figure 2Multiple sequence analysis (ClustalW) of human α4Gal-T1 and α4GlcNAc-T. Introduced gaps are shown asdashes, and aligned identical residues are black boxed. The two amino acid substitutions (M37V and M183K) are indicated above the α4Gal-T1 sequence. Conserved cysteine residues are shown by asterisks.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Sequence analysis of the α4Gal-T1 gene from six p phenotype individuals from northern Sweden revealed only one single homozygous missense mutation T548A leading to the change of residue 183 from methionine to lysine. This substitution is a few amino acid residues from the functionally important DXD motif (25.Wiggins C.A.R. Munro S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7945-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Although residue 183 is not invariant among α4Gal-T1 and the α4GlcNAc-T (M/I), the non-conservative substitution to a charged lysine residue may be expected to affect the function of the gene product. The finding that all six p individuals only revealed one missense homozygous mutation and this was not found in 12 P1+/− individuals strongly indicated that the gene identified was the Pk gene. Because α4Gal-T1 was located to the same chromosomal region (22q13.2) where the P1 polymorphism has been linked (22q12-ter), it was likely that it also represented the P1 synthase. Analysis of the α4Gal-T1 gene in P1+ and P1− individuals, revealed two silent and one missense mutation; however, none of these showed association with the P blood group phenotype (Table II). This was confirmed by genotyping of 82 individuals, 31 P1+ and 51 P1−, where no significant correlation of the 109A and the 109G allele was observed (Table III). The PCR-based RcaI restriction enzyme analysis was confirmed by Southern blot analysis of P1+/− individuals (Fig.3). The more common allele of the missense mutation at A109G encodes a methionine at residue 37 in the C-terminal part of the putative hydrophobic signal sequence (Figs. 1and 2). The conservative substitution of residue 37 to valine is not predicted to change the catalytic activity or affect retention in the Golgi.Table IIICorrelation of the missense polymorphism with P1+/− blood group phenotypePhenotypeGenotype (nt 109)CasesAllele frequencies109A109GP1+AA110.630.37AG17GG3P1−AA320.790.21AG17GG2Genotyping was performed by RcaI restriction analysis of PCR products. Open table in a new tab Genotyping was performed by RcaI restriction analysis of PCR products. Expression of full coding constructs of α4Gal-T137M and α4Gal-T137V in insect cells resulted in marked increase in galactosyltransferase activity with CDH, compared with uninfected cells or cells infected with a control construct (Fig. 4). In contrast, no activity was found with the α4Gal-T1183K gene from p individuals. Importantly, neither α4Gal-T137M or α4Gal-T137V constructs conferred α4Gal-T activity with the neolacto-series (paragloboside) glycolipid acceptor for P1 synthase activity (Fig. 4). The assay conditions for measuring Pk and P1 synthase activity was the same except substitution of the acceptor substrate, and these conditions were previously used to demonstrate both activities in kidney extracts from P1+ and P1− individuals (11.Bailly P. Piller F. Gillard B. Veyrieres A. Marcus D. Cartron J.P. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 228: 277-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The soluble, secreted construct encoding residues 47–353 did not result in active α4Gal-T activity (data not shown). Attempts to obtain complete conversion of CDH to CTH were unsuccessful, but a one-dimensional 1H NMR spectrum of the purified reaction mixture (data not shown) clearly exhibited H-1 resonances diagnostic for CTH at levels approximately 30% of those of the CDH acceptor substrate. Thus, in addition to major resonances at 4.205 ppm (3 J 1, 2 = 7.2 Hz) and 4.165 ppm (3 J 1, 2 = 7.9 Hz), corresponding to H-1 of Galβ4 and Glcβ1of CDH, minor resonances were observed at 4.794 ppm (3 J 1, 2 = 3.7 Hz) and 4.258 ppm (3 J 1, 2 = 6.9 Hz), corresponding to H-1 of Galα4 and Galβ4 of CTH (the chemical shift of Glcβ1 H-1 is not affected by the addition of the terminal Galα4 residue). The chemical shift and3 J 1,2 coupling of the downfield H-1 resonance are particularly characteristic for Galα4 of CTH and other globo-series glycosphingolipids (20.Dabrowski J. Hanfland P. Egge H. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5652-5658Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 21.Kannagi R. Levery S.B. Ishigami F. Hakomori S. Shevinsky L.H. Knowles B.B. Solter D. J. Biol.

Analysis with a number of saccharide acceptors including lactose, lactosamine, and benzyl β-lactoside revealed no significant activity over background values (data not shown). Northern analysis with mRNA from 12 human organs revealed a ubiquitous expression pattern with high expression in kidney and heart and low expression in other organs (Fig. 5). Kidney primarily synthesize globo-series glycosphingolipids (27.Clausen H. Hakomori S. Vox Sang. 1989; 56: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Analysis of eight human cell lines revealed an expression pattern correlating with α4Gal-T1 activity and cell surface expression of Pkantigen (Fig. 6) (22.Taga S. Tetaud C. Mangeney M. Tursz T.

In contrast, Namalwa cells, which do not produce Pk antigens and have no measurable α4Gal-T activity, showed no expression of α4Gal-T1. However, transient transfection of Namalwa cells with the full coding constructs of α4Gal-T1 (67 and 45) resulted in Pk/CD77 expression as revealed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis (Fig.7).Figure 6Northern blot analysis with eight human B cell lines.

The cell wall has several important physiological roles including control of morphogenesis, intercellular signaling, and pathogen interactions (1.McNeil M. Darvill A.G. Fry S.C. Albersheim P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 625-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Plant primary walls are composed mainly of a polysaccharide framework that is deposited during growth, thus determining the cell shape and size. The major components of the primary cell wall are cellulosic microfibrils, hemicellulosic polysaccharides, pectins, and glycoproteins (2.Carpita N. Gibeaut D. Plant J. 1993; 3: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). Xyloglucan (XG)1 is the major hemicellulosic polysaccharide of dicotyledonous and non-graminaceous monocotyledonous cell walls. Within the wall it is firmly bound to cellulose microfibrils (2.Carpita N. Gibeaut D. Plant J. 1993; 3: 1-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar) via hydrogen bonds and thus may have a stabilizing function. The structure of XG differs among species, although all have a β-1,4-glucan backbone with xylosyl side chains attached to the 6-O-position of the glucosyl residues in a regular pattern of three substituted glucosyl residues followed by one unsubstituted glucose at the reducing end. l-Fucose commonly terminates these side chains and is usually present in a nonasaccharide subunit (Glc4Xyl3GalFuc), designated by agreement (3.Fry S.C. York W.S. Albersheim P. Darvill A.G. Hayashi T. Joseleau J.-P. Kato Y. Lorences E.P. Maclachlan G.A. McNeil M. Mort A.J. Reid J.S.G. Seitz H. Selvendran R.R. Shibear R.R. Voragen A.G.J. White A.R.

Pea cell wall XG is thought to be constituted almost completely of alternating -XXXG- (Glc4Xyl3) and -XXFG- subunits (4.Hayashi T. Maclachlan G.

This subunit (-XLFG-) has also been detected in sycamore cell XG (6.Hisamatsu M. Impallomeni G. York W.S. Albersheim P. Darvill A.G. Carbohydr.

Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 885-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). An unadecasaccharide, -XFFG- (Glc4Xyl3Gal2Fuc2), has additionally been observed in sycamore cell XG (6.Hisamatsu M. Impallomeni G. York W.S. Albersheim P. Darvill A.G. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 211: 117-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although extensive progress has been made in understanding the structure of cell wall components such as XG, the processes of their biosynthesis and assembly are still poorly understood. Therefore, to understand the process of cell wall biosynthesis, isolation of glycosyltransferases and polysaccharide synthases becomes critical. With the exception of cellulose and callose, which are synthesized at the plasma membrane, wall polysaccharides are made in the Golgi (10.Zhang G.F. Staehelin L.A. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 1070-1083Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar), and many glycosyltransferase activities associated with their biosynthesis have been identified in plant microsomal fractions (11.Bolwell G.P. Northcote D.H. Planta. 1984; 162: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 12.Waldron K.W. Brett C.T. Brett C.T. Hillman J.R. Biochemistry of Plant Cell Wall.

Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, only two genes have been cloned at this time (15.Perrin R.M. DeRocher A.E. Bar-Peled M. Zeng W. Norambuena L.

Plant J. 1999; 19: 691-697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In previous work from our cell wall group (15.Perrin R.M. DeRocher A.E. Bar-Peled M. Zeng W. Norambuena L. Orellana A. Raikhel N.V. Keegstra K. Science. 1999; 284: 1976-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), procedures were developed to purify the XG-fucosyltransferase (XG-FTase) from pea microsomes. Two polypeptides (∼63 and ∼68 kDa) co-purified with the activity, and both of the bands were subjected to tryptic digestion and sequencing. Peptides from the ∼68-kDa band showed high sequence similarity to binding protein (BiP), a molecular chaperone. However, amino acid sequences from the ∼63-kDa polypeptide identified one clone of undetermined function in the Arabidopsis expressed sequence tag data base. The full-length Arabidopsis cDNA clone was isolated and shown to encode an ∼63-kDa polypeptide with XG-FTase activity (15.Perrin R.M. DeRocher A.E. Bar-Peled M. Zeng W. Norambuena L. Orellana A. Raikhel N.V. Keegstra K. Science. 1999; 284: 1976-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The goal of the present study is to complement and extend our earlier work by isolating a pea cDNA clone for XG-FTase (PsFT1), analyzing the biochemical characteristics of the purified pea enzyme, determining the substrate acceptor specificity, and characterizing the product of this enzyme in more detail. We show that the purified transferase is indeed XG-specific. When tamarind XG was used as an acceptor, the fucosylated subunits were the nona- and decasaccharides, -XXFG- and -XLFG-, respectively. These two subunits are found in native pea cell wall XG and also in many other plant XGs. The characteristics of PsFT1 are compared with other described fucosyltransferases. GDP-[3H]Fuc (299.7 GBq/mmol) and GDP-[14C]Fuc (10.1 GBq/mmol) were purchased from NEN Life Science Products. GDP-hexanolamine-agarose was a gift from Prof. Gerald Hart (The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore). BioSep-SEC-S4000 was purchased from Phenomenex (Torrance, CA). Tamarind seed xyloglucan andTrichoderma sp. cellulase were from Megazyme International (Ireland). For earlier studies, tamarind seed XG was isolated as described previously (17.Edwards M.E. Dea I.C.M. Bulpin P.V. Reid J.S.G. Planta. 1985; 163: 133-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Nucleotides, nucleotide sugars, all the protease inhibitors, detergents, and the amino acid-modifying reagents were from Sigma. Nasturtium seed XG and pea XG were a gift from Prof. Gordon Maclachlan (McGill University, Montreal, Canada). Rhamnogalacturonan-I and -II were a gift from Dr. Alan Darvill (Complex Carbohydrate Research Center, University of Georgia, Athens, GA). Garden pea seeds (Pisum sativum L. var. Alaska) purchased from Olds Seed Company (Madison, WI) were washed in 10% bleach for 10 min, rinsed thoroughly, soaked 6–8 h with aeration, and grown in moist vermiculate in the dark for 7 days until third internodes reached 3–5 cm in length. Growing regions (2 cm just below the hook) were excised and used as the source of enzyme. The purification was performed as described in the previous work (15.Perrin R.M. DeRocher A.E. Bar-Peled M. Zeng W. Norambuena L. Orellana A. Raikhel N.V. Keegstra K. Science. 1999; 284: 1976-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) except that in this study we did not include the anion exchange column in purification steps. The cloning of PsFT1 was accomplished in several steps. The first round PCR was performed using a plasmid cDNA library as template and degenerate primers designed from peptides P5 and P2 (Fig. 1 A) (5′-GCIGAYGGITTYGAYGARAA-3′ and 5′-ICCCCAIACRTTRTTIGTIGGRTG-3′), where I indicates inosine; R indicates purines (G + A), and Y indicates pyrimidines (T + C). The cDNA library was derived from apical hooks of auxin-treated etiolated pea seedlings in vector pBluescript SK(+) and was kindly provided by Dr. Hans Kende (Department of Energy Plant Research Laboratory, Michigan State University). A second round PCR was performed to amplify fragments covering the 5′- and 3′-ends. Primers were designed from the first round PCR products (5′-TTCTACTAGTTGACCCGGGAGT-3′ and 5′-ACTCCCGGGTCAACTAGTAGAA-3′) and the cDNA library vector (5′-TCAGGAAACAGCTATGACCATG-3′ and 5′-GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC-3′). To identify the 5′- and 3′-ends of the PsFT1 transcript, 5′- and 3′-RACE were carried out using the 5′-RACE System, version 2.0 (Life Technologies, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Poly(A)+ RNA (gift from Dr. Hans Kende, Department of Energy Plant Research Laboratory, Michigan State University) was isolated from apical hooks of etiolated pea seedlings 4 h after auxin treatment (indoleacetic acid, 100 μm), using the poly(A)TRACT mRNA isolation system (Promega). For 5′-RACE, 5′-ACTCCCGGGTCAACTAGTAGAA-3′ was the primer for cDNA synthesis, and 5′-GGCTGACTGATACCTGCTGAGACAAGATTTTT-3′ was the nested primer. For 3′-RACE, poly(dT) primer was used for cDNA synthesis, and 5′-CCAAAAAGCCTGGGCAGAAAT-3′ was the nested primer. Full-length cDNA was amplified using Pwo polymerase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), end-specific primers (5′-AATGAATATGCTGATAAAGAGAGTC-3′ and 5′-CTAATTGTCTACGAGCTTAAGGC-3′), and the same cDNA library as template. The same reaction was also performed using 300 ng genomic DNA as template to confirm the obtained sequence. All PCR products were recovered from low melting point agarose gel after electrophoresis and cloned onto the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega) for sequencing. All alignments were carried out using the software package DNASTAR version 4.0 (Madison, WI). The standard fucosyltransferase assay was performed essentially as developed (14.Faik A. Chileshe C. Sterling J. Maclachlan G. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar,18.Farkas V. Maclachlan G.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 264: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The reaction mixture (50 μl) contained enzyme (up to 10 μg of protein), polysaccharides (100 μg) as acceptor, GDP-[3H]Fuc (∼3.3 nm, ∼30,000 dpm) with 50 μm cold GDP-Fuc as donor, dissolved in the assay medium (40 mm Pipes-KOH, pH 6.8, 0.4 mmDTT, 0.16 m sucrose), and supplemented with 5 mm MgCl2. In some experiments GDP-[14C]Fuc (∼2 μm, ∼60,000 dpm) was used without adding cold GDP-Fuc. Reactions were conducted for 20–30 min at room temperature and halted with 1 ml of 67% ethanol. Washed ethanol-insoluble products were dissolved in 200 μl of water, and the incorporated label (dpm) was measured in a Beckman LS 5000 TD Counter, after adding at least 2 volumes of liquid scintillation mixture (ICN). Control reactions without XG, without protein, or with boiled protein typically resulted in 50–100 dpm/reaction. When lactose (5 mm), N-acetyllactosamine (5 mm), or tamarind XG oligosaccharides (0.2% w/v) were used as acceptors, the reactions were conducted as above and terminated by adding 300 μl of water and then 500 μl of Dowex 1-X80 resin (Cl− form) as described earlier (19.Hokke C.H. Neeleman A.P. Koeleman C.A.M. van den Eijnden D.H. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, the supernatants were saved, and the resin was washed with 2 × 1 ml of water. All the supernatants were combined, and the incorporated label was assessed as above. When glycoprotein α1-acid (200 μg per reaction) was used as acceptor, the reactions were halted by addition of 1 ml of 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 1 ml of an acid mixture of 1 m HCl containing 2% (w/v) phosphotungstic acid as described earlier (19.Hokke C.H. Neeleman A.P. Koeleman C.A.M. van den Eijnden D.H. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). After centrifugation, the pellets were washed three times with 1 ml of acid mixture and 1 ml of methanol and then resuspended in 400 μl of water. The labeled product was counted as above. The apparentM r of the enzyme subunit was determined by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (20.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) and by gel filtration using a BioCAD Perfusion Chromatography system (Perspective Biosystems) and a BioSep-SEC-S4000 column (Phenomenex) as described earlier (15.Perrin R.M. DeRocher A.E. Bar-Peled M. Zeng W. Norambuena L. Orellana A. Raikhel N.V. Keegstra K. Science. 1999; 284: 1976-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). pH stability of the enzyme was investigated by incubating the enzyme (1 μl, ∼0.3 μg) with 3 μl of 66 mm phosphate buffer at pH 3.5, 4.2, 5.2, 6.3, 6.8, 7.8, 8.4, or 9.2 for 30 min on ice. The fucosyltransferase reaction was then performed for 20 min in the standard assay using a higher concentration of Pipes, pH 6.2 (46 μl of 0.1 m), to equilibrate the pH in the reaction medium. Reactions were terminated as above. The pH optimum was determined by conducting the assay in 50 mm solution of the following buffers: phosphate buffer, pH 5.2, 6.3, 6.8, 7.8, or 8.4; acetate buffer, pH 5.2; Bis-Tris-HCl, pH 6.8; Hepes-NaOH, pH 6.9; Tris-HCl, pH 7.5 or 8.0, containing all the ingredients of the standard assay medium. To assess whether divalent cations are required for activity, MgCl2, MnCl2, or CaCl2 were included at concentrations up to 10 mm in fucosyltransferase assays lacking metal ions using ∼2 μm GDP-[14C]Fuc (∼60,000 dpm) as described above. The effects of a chelator (EDTA) and DTT were similarly tested. Determination of kinetic parameters was carried out using a 4 × 3 matrix of GDP-Fuc and tamarind XG in a standard assay conditions (in absence of MgCl2). XG-FTase velocity was measured as a function of tamarind XG (0.5, 1, or 4 mg/ml) at fixed GDP-Fuc concentrations (12.5, 25, 50, or 100 μm). Reaction mixtures contained a fixed amount of GDP-[3H]Fuc (∼3.3 nm, ∼30,000 dpm) and enough purified enzyme to have an accurate initial reaction rate in 20 min incubation time. Data were evaluated by double-reciprocal plots according to the Lineweaver-Burk method, and K m andV max values were calculated from duplicate data points (Fig. 3). Purified enzyme was subjected to amino acid group-specific modification. The following reagents were used: N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC), pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP), and N-bromosuccinimide (NBS). Modifying reagents were used according to the methods described by Britten and Bird (21.Britten C.J. Bird M.I. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1334: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Standard assays were conducted as described above in the presence of up to 5 mm of each modifying reagent using GDP-[3H]Fuc. The reactions were halted by adding 67% ethanol and washed as described above before assessing label incorporation. Controls were conducted in the absence of these modifying reagents. The substrate acceptor specificity was investigated by including alternative acceptors only or by conducting competitive inhibition experiments. The reactions used GDP-[14C]Fuc (∼2 μm). The polysaccharides used were tamarind XG, nasturtium XG, pea cell wall XG, and rhamnogalacturonan-I and -II. Tamarind XG oligosaccharide subunits monomers (7–9 degrees of polymerization) and trimers (21–27 degrees of polymerization) were prepared by partial or complete digestion withTrichoderma cellulase and purification on Bio-Gel columns. Known acceptors for glycoprotein fucosyltransferases (lactose,N-acetyllactosamine, and glycoprotein α1-acid) were also tested. Donor substrate specificity was investigated in a competition assay using tamarind XG as acceptor. Nucleotides, nucleotide sugars, and monosaccharides were tested by inclusion in the standard fucosyltransferase assay at various concentrations (up to 10 mm). Fucosylated subunits in [14C]tamarind XG were determined as described earlier (9.Desveaux D. Faik A. Maclachlan G. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 885-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 14.Faik A. Chileshe C. Sterling J. Maclachlan G. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. After digestion by Trichoderma cellulase (0.05%, w/v) and fractionation by gel filtration on a Bio-Gel P2 (Bio-Rad) column, the samples (∼10 μg of oligosaccharides, ∼100–200 dpm/μg) were further separated by HPAEC using a CarboPac PA-100 column (Dionex Corp.) with pulsed amperometric detection (PAD). Fractions of 0.65 ml were collected, neutralized, and analyzed for 14C distribution. The positions of labeled oligosaccharides were compared with those of authentic XG subunits as described (9.Desveaux D. Faik A. Maclachlan G. Plant Physiol. 1998; 118: 885-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 14.Faik A. Chileshe C. Sterling J. Maclachlan G. Plant Physiol. 1997; 114: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and identified according to the suggested nomenclature (3.Fry S.C. York W.S. Albersheim P. Darvill A.G. Hayashi T. Joseleau J.-P. Kato Y. Lorences E.P. Maclachlan G.A. McNeil M. Mort A.J. Reid J.S.G. Seitz H. Selvendran R.R. Shibear R.R. Voragen A.G.J. White A.R. Physiol. Plant. 1993; 89: 1-3Crossref Scopus (494) Google Scholar). Labeled products formed by pea microsomes were also analyzed. Following purification, tryptic peptides from each purified protein were subjected to limited amino acid sequencing. Peptide sequence information derived from this process has been published previously (15.Perrin R.M. DeRocher A.E. Bar-Peled M. Zeng W. Norambuena L. Orellana A. Raikhel N.V. Keegstra K. Science. 1999; 284: 1976-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), and Fig. 1 Adepicts the location of the six peptides derived from the 63-kDa polypeptide (P1 to P6). As a first step, a 726-base pair internal fragment of the pea XG-FTase was PCR-amplified. The nature of this product was confirmed by its 61.6% identity with AtFT1and the presence of a region encoding previously sequenced peptide P1 (Fig. 1 A). Primers designed from the middle of this fragment, together with vector-specific primers were used to amplify the cDNA fragments toward the 5′- and 3′-ends of this gene. This generated a combined cDNA sequence encompassing the entire first round PCR product. It encoded all six peptide sequences previously obtained from the purified enzyme (15.Perrin R.M. DeRocher A.E. Bar-Peled M. Zeng W. Norambuena L. Orellana A. Raikhel N.V. Keegstra K. Science. 1999; 284: 1976-1979Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) with one amino acid change in peptide P1 (Fig. 1 A), which may be a sequencing error. To ensure that we had the entire cDNA sequence of this gene, we further performed 5′- and 3′-RACE experiments. The full-lengthPsFT1 cDNA was then obtained by PCR from the cDNA library using primers specific to the 5′- and 3′-ends of the open reading frame and was consistent with the corresponding genomic clone of PsFT1 (data not shown). The deduced amino acid sequence of PsFT1 is shown in Fig. 1 A. The deduced translation product is 565 amino acid residues long, has a predicted molecular mass of 64 kDa, and has a theoretical pI of 5.91 as determined by DNASTAR (Madison, WI). A transmembrane domain was predicted by TMHMM from residues 39 to 61 (Fig. 1), consistent with the observation that Golgi-localized glycosyltransferases are type II integral membrane proteins. An overall 62.3% identity was found between PsFT1 and AtFT1. The highest similarity was observed at the COOH terminus, postulated in other characterized fucosyltransferases to contain the catalytic domain (22.Kleene R. Berger E.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1154: 283-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Although the two XG-FTase proteins have very low overall sequence similarity with the known fucosyltransferases (less than 20% identity), three conserved motifs were found. By using the PATTERNFIND program, we searched for motifs (α-2/6-motif I, α-2-motif II, α-2-motif III, α-6-motif II, and α-6-motif III) previously identified by Oriol et al. (23.Oriol R. Mollicone R. Cailleau A. Balanzino L. Breton C. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) that are present in all known α-1,2- and α-1,6-fucosyltransferases. The α-2/6-motif I, present in all these fucosyltransferases, was found in both PsFT1 and AtFT1. An additional motif was also found in PsFT1 and AtFT1 at the proper spacing for motifs III observed in all known fucosyltransferases. Both the α-2-motif III and α-6-motif III are present in PsFT1 and AtFT1 (Fig. 2). Interestingly, the α-2-motif III and α-6-motif III were previously thought to be specific to known α-1,2- and α-1,6-fucosyltransferases, respectively (23.Oriol R. Mollicone R. Cailleau A. Balanzino L. Breton C. Glycobiology. 1999; 9: 323-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The α-2-motif II and α-6-motif II were not found in PsFT1 and AtFT1. Fig. 2 summarizes the relative locations of the conserved motifs, their spacing, and their comparison to the consensus motifs of α-1,2- and α-1,6-fucosyltransferases originating from other species. The enzyme recovered from the gel filtration column was used for subsequent biochemical characterization studies. We investigated the effect of pH on the stability and activity of the purified enzyme, which was outside of a membrane environment and surrounded only by detergent. Purified pea XG-FTase was remarkably stable at extreme pH levels. Even after 30 min treatment with acidic (pH 3.5) or alkaline (pH 9.2) conditions, the enzyme retained over 80% of its activity (data not shown). This is consistent with stability during carbonate wash at pH 10.5. The fucosyltransferase was active between pH 5 and 8 with an optimum activity between pH 6 and 7 (data not shown). Complete inhibition of the pea XG-FTase activity was observed in acetate buffer at pH 5.2, whereas a decrease of ∼40% of the activity was observed with phosphate buffer at pH 5.2 (data not shown). Hepes, Pipes, and Bis-Tris at pH 6.8 did not interfere with the activity. Divalent metal ions are required for many proteins that bind nucleotide sugars. To investigate the metal ion dependence of XG-FTase, activity was measured in the presence and absence of various divalent cations. Activity was detected in the absence of cations or in the presence of EDTA (up to 10 mm) (data not shown), indicating that divalent cations are not required for its activity. However, the presence of 2 mm MgCl2 or CaCl2 in the assay medium enhanced the activity up to 30%. In contrast, MnCl2had no effect at concentrations lower than 2 mm but at higher concentrations inhibited the enzyme (up to 60%) (data not shown). Adding DTT (up to 0.5 mm) enhanced the activity up to 2-fold and did not prevent the inhibitory effect of MnCl2 (data not shown). The rate of XG-FTase activity was determined at various concentrations of XG or GDP-Fuc, respectively, and assessed by Lineweaver-Burk plots. A reciprocal plot of 1/v against 1/S at a range of GDP-Fuc and tamarind XG concentrations gave a series of straight lines that intersect on the −1/S axis (Fig.3). This pattern indicates that GDP-Fuc and tamarind XG have separate binding sites and that the binding of one substrate has no consequence for binding of the other. Thus, we concluded that XG-FTase interacted with the substrates in a random order. The K m for GDP-Fuc was ∼30 μm andV max was ∼150 mm/h/mg protein. Earlier data (24.Hanna R. Brummell D.A. Camirand A. Hensel A. Russel E. Maclachlan G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 290: 7-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) for the unpurified XG-FTase activity indicated aK m of 72 μm, with aV max of ∼0.8 mm/h/mg protein for GDP-Fuc. These results showed that the purified XG-FTase was more active with higher affinity. For tamarind XG, the K mwas ∼0.46 mg/ml (∼0.40 μm) andV max ∼200 mm/h/mg protein. The very low K m for XG may be because of a higher number of potential acceptor sites throughout the tamarind XG polymer, which increases its interaction with the enzyme. To gain some insight about the structure-function relationship in XG-FTase, catalytically essential amino acid residue types were identified. The sulfhydryl reagent NEM, a cysteine-specific modifying agent, has been widely used in discriminating between glycoprotein fucosyltransferase isotypes (25.de Vries T. Srnka C.A. Palcic M.M. Swiedler S.J. van den Eijnden D.H. Macher B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8712-8722Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Our results indicated that NEM had little effect on the XG-FTase activity, with 5 mm giving ∼40% inhibition of activity (Table I). However,N-bromosuccinimide (NBS), DEPC, and PLP reagents (which react with tryptophan, histidine and lysine residues, respectively) decreased the activity about 90–99% when applied at levels up to 5 mm (Table I). Preincubation of the XG-FTase with GDP-Fuc did not prevent inactivation by NBS treatment (data not shown). More studies using site-directed mutagenesis are needed to determine the locations and the roles of these essential residues.Table IEffect of group-specific reagents on the purified pea XG-FTase activityReagentActs onInactivation (%)0.5 mm2.5 mm5 mmNEMCysteine5.934.441.5PLPLysine51.481.087.9DEPCHistidine63.588.595.1NBSTryptophan96.096.396.4The purified enzyme (∼0.2 μg) was preincubated with the indicated modifying reagent for 20 min and assayed for [3H]fucose transfer to tamarind XG under standard assay conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Values are expressed as % inactivation.

It has receptor signaling activity that requires GTP binding and Ca2+-activated transglutaminase (TGase) activity that is inhibited by GTP binding. Gh shows no homology with other GTP-binding proteins, and its GTP-binding site has not been defined. Based on sequence analysis of [α-32P]GTP-photolabeled and proteolytically released internal peptide fragments, we report localization of GTP binding to a 15-residue segment (159YVLTQQGFIYQGSVK173) of the Ghcore domain. This was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis; a Gh/fXIIIA chimera (in which residues 162–179 of Gh were substituted with the equivalent but nonhomologous region of the non-GTP-binding TGase factor XIIIA) and a Ghpoint mutant, S171E, retained TGase activity but failed to bind and hydrolyze GTP and did not support α1B-adrenergic receptor signaling. Slight impairment of GTP binding (1.5-fold) and hydrolysis (10-fold) in the absence of altered TGase activity did not affect signaling by the mutant K173N. However, greater impairment of GTP binding (6-fold) and hydrolysis (50-fold) abolished signaling by the mutant K173L. Mutant S171C exhibited enhanced GTP binding and signaling. Thus, residues Ser171 and Lys173 are critical for both GTP binding and signaling but not TGase activity. Mutagenesis of residues N-terminal to Gly170 impaired both GTP binding and TGase activity. From computer modeling of Gh, it is evident that the GTP-binding region identified here is distinct from, but interacts with, the TGase active site. Together with structural considerations of Gh versus other GTP-binding proteins, these findings indicate that Gh has a unique GTP-binding pocket and provide for the first time a mechanism for GTP-mediated regulation of the TGase activity of Gh.

Gh/TGase II has been implicated in a wide variety of processes including apoptosis, bone ossification, wound repair (8.Upchurch H.F. Conway E. Patterson Jr., M.K. Maxwell M.P. J. Cell.

In transfected cell-based studies, Gh stimulates phospholipase C (PLC)-mediated inositol phosphate (IP) production in response to agonist activation of α1B- and α1D-adrenergic but not α1A-adrenergic receptors (ARs) (9.Nakaoka H.

One model suggests that GTP-bound Gh activates PLCδ1 (13.Feng J.-F. Rhee S.G. Im M.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16451-16454Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), whereas recent work indicates that PLCδ1 may be negatively regulated by interaction with empty or GDP-bound Gh. According to this latter model, PLCδ1 is activated as a result of receptor-stimulated GTP/GDP exchange, which allows Gh to dissociate from PLCδ1 (14.Murthy S.N. Lomasney J.W. Mak E.C. Lorand L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11815-11819Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Data from transgenic mice overexpressing Gh in the heart (15.Small K. Feng J.-F. Lorenz J.

Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 541-549Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) are consistent with the latter model. Gh has also been reported to mediate activation of the large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel in vascular smooth muscle cells (17.Lee M.-Y. Chung S. Bang H.-W. Baek K.J. Uhm D.-Y. Eur. J. Physiol. 1997; 433: 671-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) as well as inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts and bovine aortic endothelial cells (18.Gentile V. Porta R.

The TGase and signaling activities of Gh are reciprocally regulated by Ca2+ and GTP (5.Achyuthan K.E. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1901-1906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Nakaoka H. Perez D.M. Baek K.J. Das T. Husain A. Misono K. Im M.-J. Graham R.M. Science. 1994; 264: 1593-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Receptor signaling by Gh correlates with increased GTP binding (19.Im M.-J. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18944-18951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). TGase activity is inhibited by guanine nucleotides (GTPγS > GTP > GDP), whereas GTP photolabeling is inhibited by Ca2+(5.Achyuthan K.E. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1901-1906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GTP inhibition of TGase activity is inversely proportional to Ca2+ activation and is greatest under conditions where TGase activity is minimal. Extracellularly, where Ca2+ is present in millimolar concentrations and nucleotides are absent, TGase activity would be stimulated, thus allowing Gh to function in tissue remodeling. In contrast, there is evidence that the low Ca2+ and high nucleotide concentrations present intracellularly, inhibit TGase activity (20.Smethurst P.A. Griffin M. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 803-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), thus enabling Gh to function as a G-protein in receptor signaling. Although there are additional factors modulating the TGase activity of Gh, such as sphingosylphosphocholine (21.Lai T.-S. Bielawska A. Peoples K.A. Hannun Y.A. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16295-16300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and Gh-interacting proteins (22.Baek K.J. Das T. Gray C.D. Desai S. Hwang K.-C. Gacchui R. Ludwig M. Im M.-J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2651-2657Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), Ca2+ and GTP appear to control the functional switch between the two activities of Gh. Residues involved in GTP binding by Gh have not been elucidated. The only TGase structure available is that of the non-GTP-binding (5.Achyuthan K.E. Greenberg C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1901-1906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) human factor XIIIA (fXIIIA) (23.Yee V.C. Pedersen L.C. Le Trong I. Bishop P.D. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7296-7300Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). fXIIIA monomers consist of four domains: a β-sandwich, an α/β core that contains the TGase active site catalytic triad (Cys-His-Asp), and two β-barrels. The high degree of homology among TGase proteins, particularly in their core domains, suggests conservation of tertiary structure. In contrast, there is no sequence homology between Gh and other GTP-binding proteins such as the monomeric and heterotrimeric G-proteins, elongation factors, or dynamin, each of which contains four consensus GTP-binding motifs (GXXXXGK(S/T), DXXG, NXXD, and (C/S)AX) that fold into a structurally conserved GTP-binding site (24.Kjeldgaard M. Nyborg J. Clark B.F.C. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1347-1368Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Gh may thus have a novel GTP-binding site. Our previous work localized GTP binding by Gh to a region involving amino acids 139–185 of the core domain (25.Iismaa S.E. Chung L. Wu M.-J. Teller D.C. Yee V.C. Graham R.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11655-11664Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Models of Gh (25.Iismaa S.E. Chung L. Wu M.-J. Teller D.C. Yee V.C. Graham R.M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 3724-3732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) based on the crystal structure of fXIIIA predict that this region is distinct from, yet in close proximity to, the TGase active site. It is also in close proximity to residues 517–523 of barrel 1 that are involved in stabilization of GTP binding (26.Monsonego A. Shani Y. Friedmann I. Paas Y. Eizenberg O. Schwartz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3724-3732Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Mutation of the active site Cys to Ser (C277S) abolished TGase activity without affecting signaling (10.Chen S. Lin F. Iismaa S. Lee K.N. Birckbichler P.J. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32385-32391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), indicating that although the TGase and GTP-binding sites are allosterically linked, signaling can function independently of TGase activity. In the present study, we have further localized GTP binding to a 15-amino acid segment between residues 159 and 173 and have generated mutants that are altered in their GTP binding and signaling properties but not in their TGase activity. These mutants, together with the TGase-deficient, signaling-unaffected mutant (C277S) should be valuable tools for determining the respective physiological or pathological roles of Gh as a cross-linking enzyme and as a G-protein in vivo. Site-directed mutants were generated in rat Gh cDNA (25.Iismaa S.E. Chung L. Wu M.-J. Teller D.C. Yee V.C. Graham R.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11655-11664Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Overlap polymerase chain reaction was used to construct a Gh/fXIIIA chimera in which Gh cDNA (positions 480–542) was substituted with human fXIIIA cDNA (positions 637–699). Using Gh cDNA, 520- and 1566-base pair fragments were amplified (PfuDNA polymerase; Stratagene) with, respectively, primer pairs 1 (5′-CCGGAATTCCCACCATGGCAGAGGAGCTGGTC-3′) and 2 (5′- GACCTCTCCATAAAAAATTAC CCCGATGTCATTCAGGACATATTCCCGGCGCTCCGCCTC-3′) and primer pairs 3 (5′- GTAATTTTTTATGGAGAGGTC AATGACATCAAGACCAGAAGCTGGAACTTTGGGCAGTTTG-3′) and 4 (5′-TTTTCCTTTTGCGGCCGCTTAGGCGGGGCCGATGA-3′) (fXIIIA sequence is italicized; overlapping sequences are underlined). Purified fragments (Bresaspin gel extraction kit; Geneworks, Australia) were boiled (5 min, Klenow buffer; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), chilled (ice, 2 min), extended (37 °C, 30 min, 1 mm dNTPs, Klenow fragment), purified (Bresaspin polymerase chain reaction purification kit; Geneworks), and used in a polymerase chain reaction (Pfu DNA polymerase, primer pairs 1 and 4) to amplify a 2.1-kilobase pair fragment for cloning into the EcoRI andNotI sites of pGEX4T-2 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Wild type (WT) and mutant Gh were expressed as thrombin-cleavable GST-Gh fusion proteins (25.Iismaa S.E. Chung L. Wu M.-J. Teller D.C. Yee V.C. Graham R.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11655-11664Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). GST tags were cleaved from proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B (4 °C; 24 h; extraction buffer (25.Iismaa S.E.

Eluted Gh proteins were purified (Sephacryl S-200 column, 4 °C), and Gh content was approximated by Coomassie Blue R-250 staining after SDS-PAGE. WT Gh was further purified (Mono Q® 5/5 column, 4 °C, 50–600 mm NaCl linear gradient over 30 min at 0.5 ml/min) and eluted as a single peak at 380–420 mm NaCl. WT Gh (10 μm) was incubated with 10 μm [α-32P]GTP (3,000 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) and 100 μm GTP (30 °C, 3 h (25.Iismaa S.E. Chung L. Wu M.-J. Teller D.C. Yee V.C. Graham R.M.

Eluted Gh·GTP was immediately photolabeled (25.Iismaa S.E. Chung L. Wu M.-J. Teller D.C. Yee V.C. Graham R.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11655-11664Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and subjected to partial protease (Lys-C or V8) digestion (20 °C; 1–4 h; protein/enzyme ratio, 30:1). Peptides were fractionated (15% SDS-PAGE), transferred to Immobilon P, and visualized (0.1% (w/v in water) Coomassie Blue). Radiolabeled fragments were excised for sequencing by Edman degradation (Applied Biosystems Procise 494 protein sequencer). TGase activity of WT or mutant Gh(10 nm) was assayed (25.Iismaa S.E. Chung L. Wu M.-J. Teller D.C. Yee V.C. Graham R.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11655-11664Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) with 0.8% (w/v)N,N′-dimethylcasein, 10 μm[1,4-3H]putrescine (15–50 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products), 990 μm putrescine, and an addition of 0 (basal) to 2 (maximal) mm CaCl2. Reactions were stopped (400 μl of ice-cold 50% trichloroacetic acid, ice, 15 min). Trichloroacetic acid pellets were washed (3 × 500 μl of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid), dissolved (100 μl of 0.1n NaOH), and counted (10 ml of ReadySafe; NEN Life Science Products). Free Ca2+ was calculated using the “Free Ca2+” program (Dr Claude Klee, National Institutes of Health). GTPγS binding (19.Im M.-J. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18944-18951Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) by WT or mutant Gh (6.7 nm) was assessed (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.3, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 500 μm App(NH)p, 25 nm [35S]GTPγS (1250 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products), final volume 150 μl) with or without 20 μm GTPγS to determine nonspecific and total binding, respectively. Filtration buffer contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA. The charcoal method was used to determine the GTPase activity of 200 nm WT or mutant Ghincubated with 1 μm [γ-32P]GTP (30 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) and 9 μm GTP as described (25.Iismaa S.E. Chung L. Wu M.-J. Teller D.C. Yee V.C. Graham R.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11655-11664Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Intact, transiently transfected COS-1 cells were assayed for phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis as described (27.Chen S. Xu M. Lin F. Lee D. Riek P. Graham R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16320-16330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). All comparisons were done using unpaired Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered significant. To minimize nonspecific cross-linking, unbound GTP (fractions 2 and 3, Fig. 1) was separated from GTP-bound Gh by Mono Q® chromatography prior to photolabeling. Gh eluted as a single radiolabeled peak (fraction 5, Fig. 1), indicating a Gh·GTP complex. After photolabeling and partial proteolysis with V8 protease or endoproteinase Lys-C, peptide fragments were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and radioactively labeled fragments ranging from 3.5 to 14 kDa were excised and N-terminally sequenced (Table I). Four peptides were overlapping, enabling localization of GTP-labeling to a 15-amino acid segment (residues 159–173) at the start of the core domain (Fig. 2, A andC). This region is highly conserved in type II, but not other TGases (Fig. 2 B). One peptide localized to barrel 1, indicating a possible additional GTP-interacting region within this domain.Table ISequence analysis of radiolabeled peptidesProteaseFragmentSequenceaAmino acids determined by sequencing are italicizedFragment sizeDeterminedbEstimated from SDS-PAGE.TheoreticalcBased on protease recognition sites.kDaV81159 YVLTQ…E1863.53.3V82159 YVLTQQG…E2661012.3V83121 TSTGYQ…E2661416.7Lys-C475 ARFSLS…K1731411.1Lys-C5465 LAEKEE…\K5891414.1The Gh protein eluted in fraction 5 (Fig. 1 A) was covalently coupled to [α-32P]GTP by a 5-min exposure to ultraviolet light (254 nm) and partially digested with V8 protease or endoproteinase Lys-C.

Peptide fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and visualized by Coomassie Blue staining, and following autoradiography, radiolabeled fragments were excised for N-terminal sequence analysis. Two mutagenesis strategies were adopted. First, a Gh/fXIIIA chimeric cDNA was constructed, in which DNA encoding residues 162–179 of rat Gh was substituted with the equivalent region (encoding residues 207–224) of human fXIIIA. Second, a number of amino acids highly conserved in TGases II/Gh, but not in other TGases,viz. Gln163, Gln164, Gln169, Ser171, and Lys173 (Fig.2 B), were mutated either to residues in fXIIIA or to residues of equivalent volume that were either hydrophobic or maintained hydrogen bonding potential. Expression levels of Q163L and Q164L were lower than WT, and that of Q163L/Q164L was too low to purify. Binding of GTP was assessed directly by [α-32P]GTP photolabeling and by [35S]GTPγS binding. Although photolabeling of all proteins (Fig.3 A, top panel) decreased in the presence of 5 mmMgCl2, 2S. E Iismaa, M.-J. Wu, and R. M. Graham, manuscript in preparation. only Gh/fXIIIA and S171E photolabeled poorly. This was not due to a difference in protein loading, as indicated by Coomassie Blue staining of the gel (Fig. 3 A, bottom panel). The small amount of photolabeling of Gh/fXIIIA and S171E is probably due to nonspecific cross-linking of excess [α-32P]GTP, as was observed when photolabeled peptides were isolated without Mono Q®purification prior to photolabeling. GTPγS binding assays (Fig.3 B) indicated that, in addition to Gh/fXIIIA and S171E, K173L and K173N were impaired in GTP binding. This is informative, because in our hands, WT Gh has an affinity for GTP of ∼25 nm,2 and affinities lower than this cannot be readily detected by filtration assays (28.Bylund D.B. Toews M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: L421-L429PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the lack of GTPγS binding by K173L and K173N, both of which photolabel, indicates that these two mutants have a lower affinity for GTP than WT. Despite impaired GTP binding, maximally activated TGase activities of Gh/fXIIIA, K173L, K173N, and S171E were equivalent to WT (Fig. 3 C). S171C behaved like WT with respect to GTP photolabeling, GTPγS binding, and maximal TGase activity. Mutants Q169L, Q164L, Q163L, and Q163D had both impaired TGase activity and GTPγS binding. Dose-response curves for Ca2+ activation of TGase activities of Gh/fXIIIA, Ser171, and Lys173 mutants were similar to WT (Fig.4 A, TableII), confirming that these mutations had intact TGase activity. As an indirect measure of GTP binding, GTPγS inhibition of TGase activity was evaluated at both ∼10% (Fig.4 B) and ∼80% (Fig. 4 C) of maximal Ca2+-stimulated TGase activity. TGase activity of both Gh/fXIIIA and S171E was resistant to GTPγS inhibition (Table II). TGase activity of the other mutants was sensitive to GTPγS inhibition but to varying degrees; K173L was significantly less sensitive to GTPγS inhibition than WT (8-fold increase in IC50 at 10% maximal activity, p = 0.002,n = 3; 6-fold increase in IC50 at 80% maximal activity, p = 0.004, n = 3, Table II), whereas K173N was less affected and the IC50 was only significantly different from WT at higher Ca2+concentrations (1.5-fold increase in IC50 at 80% maximal TGase activity, p = 0.006, n = 3). TGase activity of S171C, on the other hand, was more sensitive to GTPγS inhibition than WT (25% of WT IC50 at 10% maximal TGase activity, p = 0.03, n = 3; 11% of WT IC50 at 80% maximal TGase activity,p = 0.0002, n = 3).Table IIKinetic parameters for calcium activation and GTPγS inhibition of TGase activityProteinEC50 for calcium activationIC50 for GTPγS inhibition10% maximal TGase activity80% maximal TGase activityμmμmWild type11 ± 24 ± 152 ± 4Gh/fXIIIA17 ± 6>500>500S171E6 ± 0.2>500>500K173L18 ± 133 ± 9299 ± 42K173N12 ± 114 ± 678 ± 3S171C28 ± 21 ± 0.16 ± 0.2The TGase activity of Gh or mutant Gh proteins was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Kinetic values were calculated from best-fit plots using GraphPad Prism.

Open table in a new tab The TGase activity of Gh or mutant Gh proteins was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Kinetic values were calculated from best-fit plots using GraphPad Prism. Data are presented as means ± S.E. of one or two experiments performed in triplicate. GTPase assays were performed to determine the effect of these mutations on GTP hydrolysis. GTPase activity of both WT recombinant (Fig. 5) and purified guinea pig liver Gh is 0.01 pmol of GTP hydrolyzed/pmol protein/min and equivalent to that of c-Ha-Ras.2 GTP hydrolysis by S171C was equivalent to WT Gh, whereas K173N was impaired, K173L was barely detectable, and that of Gh/fXIIIA and S171E was undetectable. The ability of the Gh mutants to mediate agonist-stimulated phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis was compared with that of WT Gh and Gαq. COS-1 cells were transiently cotransfected with cDNAs encoding the α1B-AR cDNA and either vector pMT4 (control), WT Gh, Gh mutants, or Gαq (Fig. 6). Basal accumulation of total [3H]IP (IP1, IP2, and IP3) was not significantly different (data not shown). After stimulation with the AR agonist (−)-epinephrine (in the presence of the β-AR antagonist,dl-propranolol (50 μm)), significant enhancement of IP accumulation was observed in cells cotransfected with either K173N or S171C relative to α1B-AR alone, indicating no impairment of signaling by these mutants. Indeed, maximal IP accumulation in S171C-cotransfected cells appeared to be significantly greater than in WT Gh-cotransfected cells and equivalent to that observed in Gαq-cotransfected cells. In cells cotransfected with K173L, (−)-epinephrine stimulation did not result in IP accumulation greater than that of α1B-AR alone, indicating an inability of this mutant to signal. Interestingly, IP accumulation after (−)-epinephrine stimulation was less in cells cotransfected with Gh/fXIIIA or S171E than in cells transfected with α1B-AR alone, suggesting a potential dominant negative effect of these mutants on signaling. Unlike the heterotrimeric or monomeric GTP-binding proteins that contain consensus GTP-binding motifs and a structurally conserved GTP-binding site, the residues forming the Gh GTP-binding pocket have not been identified. Isolation of [α-32P]GTP-labeled peptide fragments of Gh(Table I) localized GTP-labeling to a 15-amino acid segment (159YVLTQQGFIYQGSVK173) at the start of the core domain (Fig. 2, A and C) and to an additional region (residues 465–589 in barrel 1). These data agree with previous work that localized GTP binding to residues 139–185 of the core (25.Iismaa S.E. Chung L. Wu M.-J. Teller D.C. Yee V.C. Graham R.M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11655-11664Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and implicated residues 517–523 of barrel 1 in stabilization of GTP binding (26.Monsonego A. Shani Y. Friedmann I.

The conservation of residues 159–173 in the type II TGases of various species (but not in fXIIIA; TGases I, III, or IV; or band 4.2 (Fig. 2 B)) is consistent with TGase II being the only group of TGases reported to bind and hydrolyze GTP. Substitution of the core GTP-labeling region of Gh with corresponding residues from fXIIIA (Gh/fXIIIA) abolished GTP binding and hydrolysis without affecting TGase activity (Figs. Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Table II), confirming that this region is required for GTP binding. Moreover, site-directed mutagenesis identified Ser171 and Lys173 as key GTP-binding residues.

This phenomenon is frequently associated with the expression of P-glycoprotein and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1),1 both of which are ATP binding cassette (ABC) proteins. P-glycoprotein and MRP1 function as ATP-dependent efflux pumps that extrude cytotoxic drugs from the cells before they reach their intracellular targets, thus conferring resistance to many structurally dissimilar anticancer drugs, such as the Vinca alkaloids, colchicine, actinomycin D, etoposide, taxol, and anthracyclines (1.Ueda K.

However, the mechanism of transport for MRP1 could be different from that for P-glycoprotein, because the depletion of intracellular glutathione (GSH) by buthionine sulfoximine results in a complete reversal of resistance to anticancer drugs of some cell lines expressing MRP1 (6.Zaman G.J. Lankelma J. van Tellingen O. Beijnen J. Dekker H. Paulusma C. Oude Elferink R.P. Baas F. Borst P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has been reported that MRP1 transports GSH-S-conjugates such as leukotriene C4, glutathione disulfide (GSSG), and 2,4-dinitrophenyl-S-glutathione (8.Muller M. Meijer C. Zaman G.J. Borst P.

FASEB J. 1997; 11: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and that MRP1 mediates ATP-dependent transport of vincristine, daunorubicin, and etoposide in the presence of GSH (12.Loe D.W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5130-5136PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Renes J. de Vries E.G. Nienhuis E.F. Jansen P.L. Muller M. Br. J.

From these findings, it has been postulated that MRP1 can actively cotransport GSH and unmodified xenobiotics as well as GSH-S-conjugates. We have reported that MRP1 in membrane from a human MRP1cDNA transformant can be specifically photoaffinity labeled with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP by vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping (15.Taguchi Y. Yoshida A. Takada Y. Komano T. Ueda K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Vanadate and Mg2+ were required for trapping of nucleotide, and photoaffinity labeling was inhibited by the excess ADP as well as ATP. These results have suggested that a stable inhibitory complex MRP1·MgADP·Vi, an analog of the MRP1·MgADP·Pi transition state complex, is formed in the presence of vanadate, as suggested for P-glycoprotein (16.Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping in P-glycoprotein has been reported to be stimulated by the transport substrates (17.Ueda K. Inagaki N. Seino S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22983-22986Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 18.Szabo K. Welker E. Bakos E. Muller M. Roninson I. Varadi A. Sarkadi B. J. Biol.

Bhagat S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26956-26961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Because vanadate-induced trapping with 8-azido-ATP in MRP1 was stimulated in the presence of GSH and GSSG as well as anticancer drugs, we assumed that these compounds directly interact with MRP1 and stimulate the formation of the transition state in the ATPase reaction of MRP1 (15.Taguchi Y. Yoshida A. Takada Y. Komano T. Ueda K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, we have not been able to observe the cooperative effect of these compounds on vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping, which might be expected if MRP1 should actively cotransport GSH and anticancer drugs. Chang et al. (20.Chang X.B. Hou Y.X. Riordan J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30962-30968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) reported that ATPase activity of purified MRP1 was stimulated by GSH and doxorubicin and that their effects were additive; however, the stimulatory effect of GSH and doxorubicin on MRP1 ATPase was 1.7-fold at most. In this study, we examined the vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping in MRP1 at 26 °C, and found that etoposide and GSH (or GSSG) synergistically stimulate the nucleotide trapping as much as 20-fold. Interestingly, mild trypsin digestion revealed that vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping mainly occurs at NBF2. The monoclonal antibodies MRPr1 (21.Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Leslie E.M. Gerlach J.H.

Meijer C. Scheper R. Zaman G. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4557-4563PubMed Google Scholar) were purchased from Nichirei and Chemicon, respectively. Etoposide was from Sigma and Bristol Myers Squibb. 8-Azido-[α-32P]ATP was purchased from ICN Biomedicals, and [3H]17β-estradiol 17-β-d-glucuronide (E217βG) (44.0 μCi/nmol) was from NEN Life Science Products. Membranes (10 μg) were prepared from KB/MRP1, a human MRP1 cDNA transformant as described previously (15.Taguchi Y. Yoshida A. Takada Y. Komano T. Ueda K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). They were mixed with GSH and etoposide in 6 μl of TEM buffer (40 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 3 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm EGTA) containing 200 μm sodium orthovanadate and 2 mm ouabain on ice, and 10 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP was added as a final component. The mixture was incubated for 1 min at 26 °C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 500 μl of ice-cold TEM buffer, and free ATP was removed after centrifugation (15,000 × g, 5 min, 2 °C). The pellets were washed in the same buffer, resuspended in 8 μl of TEM buffer, and irradiated for 45 s (at 254 nm, 8.2 mW/cm2) on ice. The samples were electrophoresed on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and autoradiographed. The trapped 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP in MRP1 was measured by scanning with a radioimaging analyzer (BAS2000, Fuji Photo Film Co.). Experiments were done at least in triplicate. The photoaffinity-labeled membranes (20 μg) were resuspended in TEM buffer containing 0.25–2.0 μg/ml trypsin and 250 mm sucrose to 1.7 μg of membrane proteins/μl and incubated for 15 min at 20 °C. Membrane vesicles were prepared from KB-3-1 or KB/MRP1 as described previously (23.Cornwell M.M. Safa A.R. Felsted R.L. Gottesman M.M. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3847-3850Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), and the transport studies were done using the rapid filtration technique (24.Ito K. Suzuki H. Hirohashi T. Kume K. Shimizu T. Sugiyama Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1684-1688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Membrane vesicle suspension (10 μg of protein) was incubated with 57 nm [3H]E217βG in 20 μl of transport medium (10 mm Tris, 250 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4) for 30 min at 37 °C. We examined vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping in MRP1 stably expressed in KB cell membrane by using 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP. It has been reported that, when P-glycoprotein is incubated with ATP and vanadate, the inhibition of P-glycoprotein ATPase activity induced by vanadate is rapid, reaching completion in less than 10 s at 37 °C (25.Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). Because we assumed that the reaction of MRP1 would be as fast as P-glycoprotein and the reaction at 37 °C would be too fast to be analyzed quantitatively, we examined the time course of vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping in MRP1 at 26 °C. When membranes from KB/MRP1 were incubated with vanadate, Mg2+, and 10 μm8-azido-[α-32P]ATP, followed by UV irradiation after removing free ligands, a 190-kDa protein was specifically photoaffinity-labeled in a time-dependent manner (Fig.1 A, lanes 1–4). The 190-kDa protein was not labeled in membrane proteins from untransfected KB-3-1 (data not shown), indicating that the 190-kDa protein is MRP1. In the presence of 2 mm GSSG, which is considered to be one of the endogenous substrates for MRP1 (9.Ishikawa T. Li Z.S. Lu Y.P. Rea P.A. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), photoaffinity labeling of a 190-kDa protein was stimulated (Fig.1 A, lanes 5–8) and showed a strong time dependence up to 2 min (Fig. 1 B). We examined the effects of GSH, GSSG, and etoposide on the nucleotide trapping in KB/MRP1 membranes incubated at 26 °C for 1 min with 10 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP (Fig.2). KB/MRP1 cells showed the highest resistance to etoposide among the anticancer drugs examined (15.Taguchi Y. Yoshida A. Takada Y. Komano T. Ueda K. FEBS Lett. 1997; 401: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). GSSG, GSH, and etoposide significantly stimulated nucleotide trapping in a concentration-dependent manner. The nucleotide trapping is stimulated 4.3- and 2.2-fold by 2 mm GSSG and GSH, respectively, and 3.7-fold by 1 mm etoposide. The unmodified xenobiotics have been suggested to be actively cotransported with GSH (12.Loe D.W. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5130-5136PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Renes J. de Vries E.G. Nienhuis E.F. Jansen P.L. Muller M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 126: 681-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). If this is true, then GSH and xenobiotics can be expected to cooperatively affect ATP hydrolysis of MRP1. To explore this possibility, we examined the effect of etoposide on the nucleotide trapping in the presence of GSH. Fig.3 A shows that etoposide at 0.5 mm and 1 mm stimulates the nucleotide trapping about 20-fold in the presence of 2 mm GSH. Interestingly, in the presence of 2 mm GSSG, etoposide also stimulates the nucleotide trapping to the similar extent. The combination of 2 mm GSH and 2 mm GSSG did not stimulate nucleotide trapping more than 2 mm GSSG alone did (data not shown). No stimulatory effect on the nucleotide trapping with etoposide was noted with 2-mercaptoethanol or dithiothreitol, which are other reducing agents (data not shown). In the absence of Mg2+ or vanadate, and in the presence of excess ATP, nucleotide trapping was reduced by 98%, 97%, and 96%, respectively at 26 °C (Fig. 3 B). Excess ADP also reduced the nucleotide trapping, but the inhibitory effect (85%) was less than ATP at 26 °C (lane 6). At 37 °C, excess ADP reduced nucleotide trapping as efficiently as excess ATP did (94% by ADP and 98% by ATP) (Fig. 3 C). The cooperative stimulation of the nucleotide trapping by GSH and etoposide suggested that they interact with MRP1 at different sites as proposed (26.Ishikawa T. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 219-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and that those bindings stimulate the nucleotide trapping cooperatively. Therefore, we assumed that these bindings might have different effects on the two NBFs of MRP1. For example, GSH binding might stimulate ATP hydrolysis at one of the two NBFs, and etoposide binding might stimulate it at the other. Mild trypsin digestion of MRP1 has been reported to produce two large polypeptides (21.Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Leslie E.M. Gerlach J.H. Grant C.E. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23623-23630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). One is a fragment of approximately 120 kDa, corresponding to the N-proximal half of MRP1, and the second is a fragment of 75–80 kDa, corresponding to the C-proximal half of MRP1. It is supposed that the 120-kDa fragment contains NBF1 and the 75- to 80-kDa fragment contains NBF2, because they react with antibodies against NBF1 and NBF2, respectively (21.Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Leslie E.M. Gerlach J.H. Grant C.E. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23623-23630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To examine which NBF is photoaffinity-labeled, photoaffinity-labeled MRP was digested with trypsin. KB/MRP1 membranes were incubated with 10 or 100 μm8-azido-[α-32P]ATP and vanadate in the presence or absence of GSH and etoposide at 26 °C for 1 min. Then, membrane proteins were photoaffinity-labeled by UV irradiation after removing free ligands and mildly digested with 2.0 μg/ml trypsin for 15 min at 20 °C. The mild trypsin digestion produced strongly photoaffinity-labeled 75- to 80-kDa fragments and a faintly labeled 120-kDa fragment under any conditions examined (GSSG alone, etoposide alone, and etoposide with GSH) (Fig.4 A). The photoaffinity-labeled 120-kDa fragment was observed slightly better with 100 μm8-azido-[α-32P]ATP than with 10 μm8-azido-[α-32P]ATP. However, the 75- to 80-kDa fragments were mainly photoaffinity-labeled under any conditions examined. Western blotting (Fig. 4 B) indicates that the120-kDa fragment, produced by the mild trypsin digestion, was recognized by monoclonal antibody (mAb) MRPr1, and the 75- to 80-kDa fragments were recognized by mAb MRPm6 as reported previously (21.Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Leslie E.M. Gerlach J.H. Grant C.E. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23623-23630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). MRPr1 and MRPm6 have been reported to recognize the N-proximal half of MRP1 containing NBF1 and the C-proximal half containing NBF2, respectively (21.Hipfner D.R. Almquist K.C. Leslie E.M. Gerlach J.H. Grant C.E. Deeley R.G. Cole S.P.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23623-23630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Photoaffinity labeling, done in parallel, showed that the labeled 75- to 80-kDa fragments comigrated with the fragments recognized by MRPm6 (lane 5). These results suggest that NBF2 of MRP1 is preferentially photoaffinity-labeled. To confirm that the 75- to 80-kDa fragments, containing NBF2, were preferentially photoaffinity-labeled, the decrease of photoaffinity-labeled undigested MRP1 and the increase of labeled tryptic fragments were measured. KB/MRP1 membranes were incubated with 10 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP and vanadate in the presence of GSH and etoposide at 26 °C and were photoaffinity-labeled by UV irradiation after removing free ligands. They were then incubated with various concentrations of trypsin for 15 min at 20 °C (Fig. 5). The photoaffinity-labeled band of undigested MRP1 decreased and those of tryptic fragments increased with increasing concentrations of trypsin (Fig. 5 B). By incubating with 0.25 μg/ml trypsin, the photoaffinity-labeled band of undigested MRP1 decreased 24 ± 6%, and those of the 120- and 75- to 80-kDa tryptic fragments increased 3 ± 2% and 20 ± 4%, respectively. This indicates that most of 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP is trapped in the 75- to 80-kDa fragments containing NBF2 after incubation in the presence of GSH and etoposide. To confirm that 8-azido-ATP supports the active transport activity of MRP, we examined ATP-dependent E217βG uptake into membrane vesicles prepared from KB/MRP1 (Fig. 6). E217βG has been reported to be a good substrate for MRP1 (27.Loe D.W. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9683-9689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). [3H]E217βG uptake into membrane vesicles prepared from KB/MRP1 was observed in the presence of 8-azido-ATP as well as ATP, but not in the presence of AMP or ADP. The ATP-dependent uptake of [3H]E217βG into membrane vesicles prepared from KB-3-1 host cells was less than one-tenth of that with membrane vesicles prepared from KB/MRP1. These results suggest that 8-azido-ATP is hydrolyzed by MRP1 and supports active transport by MRP1. We demonstrated in the present study that MRP1 is specifically photoaffinity-labeled with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP in KB/MRP1 membranes. The photoaffinity labeling of MRP is dependent on vanadate and Mg2+ and is inhibited by the excess ADP as well as ATP. These properties of vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping is similar to those of P-glycoprotein (25.Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Weber J. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19383-19390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). 8-Azido-ATP supports active transport of E217βG into plasma membrane vesicles from KB/MRP1 (Fig.6). 8-Azido-ATP also supports active transport of leukotriene C4 with similar an apparent K m for ATP (28.Gao M. Cui H.-R. Loe D.W. Grant C.E. Almquist K.C. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13098-13108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). These results suggest that a stable inhibitory complex, MRP1·MgADP·Vi, an analog of the MRP1·MgADP·Pitransition state complex, is formed in the presence of vanadate after ATP hydrolysis, as suggested for P-glycoprotein (16.Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). However, more experiments are needed to establish whether there is a good correlation between vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping and ATP hydrolysis by MRP. The vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping of MRP1 with 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP is stimulated by GSH, GSSG, and etoposide, and, importantly, is synergistically stimulated by both GSH and etoposide and by GSSG and etoposide. These results suggest that glutathione and etoposide interact with MRP1 at different sites as proposed (26.Ishikawa T. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 219-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and that those bindings cooperatively stimulate the nucleotide trapping. GSSG is transported by MRP1 (29.Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Buchholz U. Center M. Cole S.P. Deeley R.G. Keppler D. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), whereas transport of GSH is controversial (6.Zaman G.J. Lankelma J. van Tellingen O. Beijnen J. Dekker H. Paulusma C. Oude Elferink R.P. Baas F. Borst P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7690-7694Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar, 29.Leier I. Jedlitschky G. Buchholz U. Center M. Cole S.P.

Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5232-5237PubMed Google Scholar). Lower stimulation of vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping in MRP1 by GSH compared with GSSG suggests that GSHper se is not a good substrate for MRP1. Synergistic stimulation of vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping by etoposide and GSH suggests that their simultaneous binding to MRP1 cooperatively induces conformational changes at the catalytic NBF. Because GSSG is as effective as GSH for stimulating vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping in the presence of etoposide, and because GSSG would not interact with etoposide even in a noncovalently associated form, etoposide may be recognized as an unmodified form by MRP together with glutathione as proposed (6.Zaman G.J. Lankelma J. van Tellingen O. Beijnen J. Dekker H. Paulusma C. Oude Elferink R.P. Baas F. Borst P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We have examined the effects of doxorubicin and vincristine on vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping in MRP. However, they did not show such strong synergistic effects with glutathione as etoposide showed (data not shown). The reason why etoposide shows such a strong synergistic effect with glutathione remains to be identified. In P-glycoprotein, two NBFs appear to be functionally equivalent (16.Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Both NBFs can hydrolyze ATP, and vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping occurs in both NBFs probably nonselectively (19.Urbatsch I.L. Sankaran B. Bhagat S. Senior A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26956-26961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar) and sequentially (16.Senior A.E. al-Shawi M.K. Urbatsch I.L. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar,31.Hrycyna C.A. Ramachandra M. Ambudkar S.V. Ko Y.H. Pedersen P.L. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16631-16634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Mild trypsin digestion of MRP1 reveals that vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping occurs mainly at NBF2 under any conditions examined: under a basal condition, in the presence of GSSG alone, etoposide alone, and etoposide and GSH. There could be several possible explanations for the preferential vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping at NBF2: the first is that NBF1 has lower ATP binding affinity than does NBF2. If that is the case, NBF1 might not be photoaffinity-labeled with 10 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP. However, NBF2 was preferentially photoaffinity-labeled even with 100 μm 8-azido-[α-32P]ATP. The second explanation is that MRP1 hydrolyzes ATP only at NBF2; the third is that ATP hydrolysis of MRP1 occurs selectively at NBF2 first, when substrates bind to MRP, and then at NBF1. If the first catalytic turnover occurs selectively at NBF2 of MRP1, it would produce an intermediate containing ADP at NBF2, and then vanadate would bind to this intermediate to form a stable inhibitory complex, MRP1·MgADP·Vi at NBF2. This would not allow any further reaction at NBF1, and no vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping would occur at NBF1. The fourth explanation would be that NBF1 of MRP1 also hydrolyzes ATP but a stable inhibitory complex, MRP1·MgADP·Vi, is not formed at NBF1. It is not clear yet what causes the preferential photoaffinity labeling of NBF2. However, these results suggest that the two NBFs of MRP1 are functionally nonequivalent. Nonequivalent features between two NBFs of ABC proteins have been reported for SUR1 and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). SUR1 is a subunit of the pancreatic β-cell KATP channel, which plays a key role in the regulation of glucose-induced insulin secretion. SUR1 may not be a transporter or a channel but may function only as a switch that monitors intracellular ATP/ADP concentrations. SUR1 binds ATP strongly at NBF1 even in the absence of Mg2+ and binds MgADP at NBF2 (17.Ueda K. Inagaki N. Seino S. J. Biol.

Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1268-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 33.Matsuo M. Kioka N. Amachi T. Ueda K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37479-37482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). CFTR is an ATP-dependent chloride channel and malfunctions in cystic fibrosis. NBF1 of CFTR was preferentially labeled with 8-azido-ATP in the absence of vanadate. The addition of vanadate increased photoaffinity labeling and resulted in the labeling of both NBFs of CFTR (34.Szabo K. Szakacs G. Hegeds T. Sarkadi B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12209-12212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In conclusion, vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping in MRP1 is strongly and synergistically stimulated by the presence of etoposide and glutathione. Interestingly, vanadate-induced nucleotide trapping occurs mainly at NBF2, suggesting the nonequivalency of two NBFs of MRP1. This new finding on variation in the cooperativity of the two NBFs in ABC proteins should promote understanding of the molecular basis of the differences in function of the various ABC proteins as transporters, ion channels, or ion channel regulators.

Consequently, regulation of procaspase processing is critical to apoptotic execution. We report here that baculovirus pancaspase inhibitor P35 and inhibitor of apoptosis Op-IAP prevent caspase activation in vivo, but at different steps. By monitoring proteolytic processing of endogenousSf-caspase-1, an insect group II effector caspase, we show that Op-IAP blocked the first activation cleavage at TETD↓G between the large and small caspase subunits. In contrast, P35 failed to affect this cleavage, but functioned downstream to block maturation cleavages (DXXD↓(G/A)) of the large subunit. Substitution of P35's reactive site residues with TETDG failed to increase its effectiveness for blocking TETD↓G processing of pro-Sf-caspase-1, despite wild-type function for suppressing apoptosis. These data are consistent with the involvement of a novel initiator caspase that is resistant to P35, but directly or indirectly inhibitable by Op-IAP. The conservation of TETD↓G processing sites among insect effector caspases, including Drosophila drICE and DCP-1, suggests that in vivo activation of these group II caspases involves a P35-insensitive caspase and supports a model wherein apical and effector caspases function through a proteolytic cascade to execute apoptosis in insects.

These highly conserved, aspartate-specific proteases are expressed as single-chain zymogens, which upon apoptotic signaling are activated by proteolytic processing, either by autoactivation, transactivation, or cleavage by other caspases (reviewed in Refs. 5.Green D.R.

Once activated, the caspases proteolytically cleave a multitude of cellular substrates, leading to apoptotic death. Thus, caspase activation is a key regulatory point in the commitment to apoptosis. The molecular mechanisms regulating caspase activation are largely unknown. In mammals, a proteolytic cascade is initiated by group III caspases with long N-terminal prodomains (reviewed in Refs. 2.Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y.

Since SF21 apoptosis is fully blocked by P35 and Op-IAP, we subjected these cells to different death stimuli and monitored pro-Sf-caspase-1 processing in the presence and absence of both apoptotic regulators. We report here that pro-Sf-caspase-1 is proteolytically activated in SF21 cells and represents the principal contributor to intracellular caspase activity. Suppression of apoptosis was correlated with inhibition ofSf-caspase-1 activation by Op-IAP and P35, indicating thatSf-caspase-1 activity is a direct or indirect target of these anti-apoptotic proteins. Op-IAP blocked the first in a series of caspase-like cleavages required for pro-Sf-caspase-1 activation. In contrast, P35 selectively blocked subsequent cleavages of the large subunit. Thus, P35 prevented in vivo caspase maturation at steps downstream from that affected by Op-IAP. Collectively, our data indicate that signal-induced activation of pro-Sf-caspase-1 involves at least two consecutively acting caspases and suggest that apoptosis in insects involves caspase-mediated proteolytic cascades.

P4-P1′ substitution plasmids pIE1-P35H6TETDG, pIE1-P35H6WEHDG, and pIE1-P35H6KQVDS were generated by using overlap extension PCR with primers: P35TETDG-R, 5′-GAATCCATCAGTTTCAGTGCTGTAATCGCGTTC-3′; P35WEHDG-R, 5′-GAATCCATCATGTTCCCAGCTGTAATCGCGTTC-3′; P35KQVDS-R, 5′-GAATGAGTCGACTTGTTTGCTGTAATCGCGTTC-3′; P35TETDG-F, 5′-TACAGCACTGAAACTGATGGATTCCACGATAGC-3′; P35WEHDG-F, 5′-TACAGCTGGGAACATGATGGATTCCACGATAGC-3′; P35KQVDS-F, 5′-TACAGCAAACAAGTCGACTCATTCCACGATAGCATC-3′; P35BstF, 5′-CAGGTGGACAAACAAACCAGAG-3′; and P35Spe-R, 5′-ATTTTTGTTGACTGCACTAGT-3′. Purified PCR products were digested with MunI and HindIII, and inserted into the corresponding sites of pIE1-P35H6. Each plasmid contained the p35 ORF fused to a C-terminal His6tag placed under control of the baculovirus immediate earlyie-1 gene promoter. Expression of pET-based plasmids pET22/Sfcasp1, pP35-C(His6), pP35(D84A)-C(His6), and pP35(D87A)-C(His6) (34.Bertin J. Mendrysa S.M. LaCount D.J. Gaur S. Krebs J.F. Armstrong R.C. Tomaselli K.J. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6251-6259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) was induced by isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside addition. Ni2+-charged resin (Qiagen) was mixed with E. coli extracts containing proteinsSf-caspase-1His, P35-His6, P35(D84A)-His6, or P35-(D87A)-His6 in binding buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 45 mm imidazole, 500 mm NaCl) for 2 h at 4 °C. After washing, bound protein was eluted with binding buffer containing 200 mm imidazole. Protein concentrations were determined by using the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Protein purity was >90% as determined by staining with Colloidal Burst Coomassie G Stain (z axis) after sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). At the indicated times after infection, 2 × 107 SF21 cells were collected by centrifugation (500 × g), washed with phosphate-buffered saline (54.Lee H.H. Miller L.K. J. Virol. 1978; 27: 754-767Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and suspended in lysis buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mmdithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture (PharMingen). Apoptotic vesicles were collected by centrifugation (10,000 × gfor 10 min), suspended in lysis buffer, and combined with the intact cells. After a 15 min incubation on ice, cell debris was removed by centrifugation (16,000 × g at 4 °C) and the supernatants were stored at −80 °C. The supernatant from 105 cells (10 μl) was added to a reaction mix (90 μl) containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 μm Ac-DEVD-amc (Peptides International) as substrate. Release of the fluorescent product 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin was monitored by using a Molecular Dynamics Biolumin 960 Kinetic Fluorescence/Absorbance microplate reader with 360-nm and 465-nm filters at 30-s intervals for 20 min. Rates of product formation were obtained from the linear portion of the reaction curves within the first 10% of substrate depletion. Increasing concentrations of recombinant P35-His6, P35(D84A)-His6, or P35(D87A)-His6, were mixed with 200 fmol of purifiedSf-caspase-1His in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% CHAPS, 10% sucrose, and 2 mm dithiothreitol in a total volume of 100 μl. After 30 min at room temperature, 2 μl of 0.5 mm Ac-DEVD-amc was added to give a final concentration of 10 μm. Product release was monitored as described above. The percentSf-caspase-1 activity is reported as the ratio of the rate of product release in the presence and absence of recombinant P35-His6. E. coli-derived Sf-caspase-1His was purified by metal affinity chromatography and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The large subunit p19 was excised and eluted. The antiserum α-Sfcasp1 was prepared by using New Zealand White rabbits and standard procedures by the University of Wisconsin Medical School Polyclonal Antibody Service. Purified proteins or total cell lysates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. After blocking, the membranes were incubated with 1:2,500 dilution of α-Sfcasp1 or a 1:10,000 dilution of α-T7 (Novagen), followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG, respectively.Sf-caspase-1-related proteins were imaged by color development with nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate as described previously (56.Hershberger P.A. LaCount D.J. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3467-3477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Uninfected or infected (21 h after inoculation) SF21 cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and fractionated by Dounce homogenization and differential centrifugation as described previously (56.Hershberger P.A. LaCount D.J. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3467-3477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After removing nuclei by low speed centrifugation, heavy and light membranes were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g and 150,000 ×g, respectively. The 150,000 × gsupernatant is designated as the cytosolic fraction. Photographs and immunoblots were scanned at a resolution of 300 d.p.i. by using a Hewlett Packard ScanJetIIcx. The resulting files were modified by using Adobe Photoshop 3.0 and Illustrator 7.0. During apoptosis, S. frugiperda SF21 cells generate a unique caspase activity that is sensitive to inhibition by P35 and IAP (24.Manji G.A. Hozak R.R. LaCount D.J. Friesen P.D. J.

To identify the in vivo targets of these apoptotic regulators, we monitored signal-induced activation of Sf-caspase-1, an endogenous caspase cloned from cultured S. frugiperda cells (49.Ahmad M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1421-1424Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar).Sf-caspase-1 is a group II-like caspase with a short prodomain (Fig. 1 A). It yields an enzymatically active complex of large and small subunits when overproduced in E. coli (Fig. 1 B). To investigate the in vivo activation of pro-Sf-caspase-1 and to determine its contribution to apoptotic execution, we purified the large subunit (p19) and generatedSf-caspase-1-specific antiserum (α-Sfcasp1). In SF21 cells, pro-Sf-caspase-1 was detected as a prominent 35-kDa protein by immunoblots using α-Sfcasp1 (Fig. 1 C). Upon transfection with plasmid expressing N-terminal T7-taggedSf-casp1 (Sf-casp1T7),Sf-caspase-1T7 was also detected (Fig.1 C, lanes 5–8). Induction of apoptosis by UV irradiation caused processing of bothSf-caspase-1T7 and endogenous pro-Sf-caspase-1 (Fig. 1 C, lanes 1–8). The appearance of the large subunit p19 coincided with the start of apoptotic blebbing (3 h after irradiation). As expected, the accumulation of p19 was greater inSf-casp1T7-transfected cells (lanes 5–8). Since processing removed the T7 tag, transfected p19 was indistinguishable from endogenous p19 andE. coli-produced p19 (Fig. 1 C, lane 10). Although not recognized by α-Sfcasp1, the small subunit p12 was detected by immunoblots using p12-specific antiserum (data not shown). A less abundant protein (29 kDa) with a size expected of Sf-caspase-1 lacking its prodomain (Δpro) was also detected (Fig. 1 C). As a downstream effector caspase, diverse apoptotic signals should promoteSf-caspase-1 activation. We therefore tested whether pro-Sf-caspase-1 is processed during baculovirus infection, a potent apoptotic stimulus for SF21 cells (15.Miller L.K. Kaiser W.J. Seshagiri S. Semin. Virol. 1998; 8: 445-452Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Upon infection of SF21 cells with vΔp35 (−p35/−iap), an apoptosis-inducing mutant that lacks functional p35 andiap (55.Hershberger P.A. Dickson J.A. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5525-5533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), pro-Sf-caspase-1 was proteolytically processed to its subunits. p19 appeared between 12 and 15 h after infection (Fig. 2 A), which coincided with the initiation of apoptotic blebbing. Moreover, the accumulation of p19 paralleled the increase in intracellular caspase activity as measured by DEVD-amc cleavage in extracts of infected cells (Fig. 2 B). The observed processing of pro-Sf-caspase-1 by diverse apoptotic signals is consistent with a downstream effector role for this caspase. Interestingly, pro-Sf-caspase-1 levels were only minimally depleted by both apoptotic stimuli (Figs. 1 C and 2 A), suggesting that only a fraction of the endogenous pro-Sf-caspase-1 requires activation for apoptotic execution. The caspase activity present in apoptotic SF21 cells (Fig.2 B) is distinguished by its unique sensitivity to wild-type P35, but not D84A-mutated P35 in which the P4 Asp residue is substituted with Ala (34.Bertin J. Mendrysa S.M. LaCount D.J. Gaur S. Krebs J.F. Armstrong R.C. Tomaselli K.J. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6251-6259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, human caspase-3 is potently inhibited by D84A-mutated P35 (34.Bertin J. Mendrysa S.M. LaCount D.J. Gaur S. Krebs J.F. Armstrong R.C. Tomaselli K.J. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6251-6259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To determine if recombinantSf-caspase-1 exhibits the same P35 inhibition profile, purified Sf-caspase-1His was tested in dose-dependent inhibition assays that used the tetrapeptide DEVD-amc as substrate (Fig. 3). As expected, Sf-caspase-1His was potently inhibited by purified P35-His6. An equimolar ratio of wild-type P35-His6 reduced Sf-caspase-1 activity by 95%. In contrast, even a 12-fold molar excess of D84A-substituted P35-His6 failed to affect protease activity (Fig. 3). D84A-substituted P35-His6 was as ineffective as D87A-substituted P35-His6, a loss-of-function mutation lacking the requisite cleavage residue Asp87 (34.Bertin J. Mendrysa S.M. LaCount D.J. Gaur S. Krebs J.F. Armstrong R.C. Tomaselli K.J. Friesen P.D. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 6251-6259Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the coincidence of P35 inhibition profiles of purifiedSf-caspase-1 and apoptotic extracts of SF21 cells suggested that Sf-caspase-1 is a principal contributor to caspase activity in these cells. Consistent with this conclusion, overexpression ofSf-casp1T7-sensitized cells to apoptosis. SF21 cells transfected withSf-casp1T7 underwent apoptosis upon infection with a p35-expressing baculovirus (Fig.4, lane 3). In this case, the level of apoptotic intracellular DNA fragmentation was"

Pretreatment of CCR5 L1.2 transfectants or T-cells with the phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate markedly abolished MIP1β-induced chemotaxis. Syk was also activated upon MIP1β stimulation of CCR5 L1.2 transfectants or T-cells and associated with RAFTK. Overexpression of a dominant-negative Src-binding mutant of RAFTK (RAFTKm402) significantly attenuated Syk activation, whereas overexpression of wild-type RAFTK enhanced Syk activity, indicating that RAFTK acts upstream of CCR5-mediated Syk activation.

Despite the emerging role of CCR5 and its ligands in HIV infection and the immune response, relatively little is known about the signaling pathways mediated by this receptor. CCR5 has been shown to induce calcium signals and chemotaxis upon binding to the macrophage-tropic HIV gp160 recombinant envelope protein (14.Weissman D. Rabin R.L. Arthos J. Rubbert A. Dybul M.

To further elucidate MIP1β-induced CCR5 signaling pathways, we have delineated the roles of the SH2 domain-containing cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatase subfamily members SHP1 and SHP2 and of the Src-related kinase Syk. SHP1 (also named SHPTP1, PTPK, HC, or SHP) is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells, whereas SHP2 (also called SHPTP2, PTP1D, SYP, PTP2C, or SHPTP3) is expressed ubiquitously (17.Streuli M.

Prior analysis of RAFTK indicated that tyrosine 402 in its N-terminal domain binds to the SH2 domain of Src kinases and activates such Src kinases upon lipopolysaccharide or bradykinin treatment (40.Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). This study demonstrates that MIP1β stimulation of CCR5 transfectants induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP1 and SHP2 and activates Syk. This induction also results in the formation of a signaling complex consisting of RAFTK, Syk, SHP1, and Grb2. These results indicate that RAFTK acts upstream of Syk and suggest that it does not regulate the SHP1 and SHP2 phosphorylation mediated by CCR5. Anti-RAFTK antibodies were generated as described previously (41.Li J. Avraham H. Rogers R.A. Raja S. Avraham S. Blood. 1996; 88: 417-428Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This antiserum recognized both human and murine forms of RAFTK and did not cross-react with focal adhesion kinase. Antibodies to Syk, SHP1, and SHP2 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10) was a generous gift from Dr. Brian Druker (Oregon Health Sciences University, Portland, OR). Electrophoresis reagents and nitrocellulose membranes were obtained from Bio-Rad. The protease inhibitors leupeptin and α1-antitrypsin and all other reagents were acquired from Sigma. Indo-1/AM was purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). CCR5 was transfected into the pre-B lymphoma cell line L1.2 as described previously (42.Wu L. Gerard N.P. Wyatt R. Choe H. Parolin C.

Med. 1997; 185: 1681-1691Crossref PubMed Scopus (639) Google Scholar), and transfectants were selected in medium containing mycophenolic acid. FACS analysis was used to monitor the cell-surface expression of CCR5. CCR5 was expressed at a high level in these cells (42.Wu L. Gerard N.P. Wyatt R. Choe H. Parolin C. Ruffing N. Borsetti A. Cardoso A.A. Desjardin E. Newman W. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Nature. 1996; 384: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). The β-chemokines MIP1α, MIP1β, and RANTES bind with high affinity to the expressed CCR5 receptors. These cells possess properties characteristic of native CCR5, as they bind to macrophage-tropic HIV-1 gp120 in the presence of soluble human CD4 (42.Wu L. Gerard N.P. Wyatt R. Choe H. Parolin C. Ruffing N. Borsetti A. Cardoso A.A. Desjardin E. Newman W. Gerard C. Sodroski J. Nature. 1996; 384: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). CCR5 transfectants and mutants were grown in RPMI 1640 medium (containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mmol/liter glutamine, 1 mmol/liter sodium pyruvate, 50 μg/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 55 μmol/liter β-mercaptoethanol) supplemented with 100 nmol/liter sodium hypoxanthine, 16 nmol/liter thymidine, 2.5 μg/ml mycophenolic acid, and 125 μg/ml xanthine. CCR5 L1.2 transfectants containing RAFTK constructs were grown in mycophenolic acid medium containing 0.8 mg/liter Geneticin (G418, Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfectants of mutants RAFTKm402 and RAFTKm906 and wild-type RAFTK (RAFTKWT) were produced by transfection of the CCR5 L1.2 cells with the RAFTKm402, RAFTKm906, or RAFTKWT construct, respectively (15.Ganju R.K. Dutt P. Wu L. Newman W. Avraham H. Avraham S. Groopman J.E. Blood. 1998; 91: 791-797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pcDNA vector without an RAFTK construct was used as a control. Mutants RAFTKm906 and RAFTKm402 were generated by replacing Tyr906 and Tyr402 with Phe, respectively, by site-directed mutagenesis. Tyr906 of RAFTK is the putative binding site for phosphatases, and Tyr402has previously been shown to bind to Src kinases (40.Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). Plasmids carrying RAFTKm906, RAFTKm402, RAFTKWT, or pcDNA control vector were transfected by electroporation into the CCR5 L1.2 cells using Bio-Rad electroporation equipment. The transfectants were selected in medium containing mycophenolic acid and G418. The double mutants expressed equal amounts of CCR5 as determined by FACS analysis. Several clones of double transfectants were used in the signaling studies. T-cell-enriched, monocyte-depleted cultures were generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells as described (15.Ganju R.K. Dutt P. Wu L. Newman W. Avraham H. Avraham S. Groopman J.E. Blood. 1998; 91: 791-797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Alfano M. Schmidtmayerova H. Amella C.A. Pushkarsky T. Bukrinsky M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 597-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, peripheral blood mononuclear cells were separated by Ficoll-Hypaque gradient centrifugation and two rounds of adherence to plastic. Non-adherent cells were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (5 μg/ml) for 3 days. Cells were removed to fresh medium supplemented with recombinant human interleukin-2 (Advanced Biotechnologies, Columbia, MD). Three-week-old activated T-cells, which were found to be ∼35% positive for CCR5 by FACS analysis, were used for further studies. Cells were washed twice with 1× Hanks' buffered salt solution (Sigma), resuspended at 10 × 106 cells/ml in 1× Hanks' buffered salt solution, and then starved of serum for 2 h at 37 °C. The serum-starved cells were stimulated with 200 ng/ml MIP1β at 37 °C for various time periods. Following stimulation, cells were lysed using modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mmol/liter Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mmol/liter NaCl, 1 mmol/liter phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 mmol/liter sodium vanadate, 10 mmol/liter sodium fluoride, and 10 mmol/liter sodium pyrophosphate). Total cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 10 min. Protein concentrations were determined by protein assay (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation studies were conducted as described (45.Ganju R.K. Brubaker S.A. Meyer J. Dutt P. Yang Y. Qin S. Newman W. Groopman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23169-23175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Briefly, identical amounts of protein from each time point were clarified by incubation with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose was removed by brief centrifugation, and the supernatants were incubated with different primary antibodies as described below for each experiment for 2 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation of the antibody-antigen complexes was performed by incubation at 4 °C overnight with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose (10% suspension). Nonspecific bound proteins were removed by washing the Sepharose beads three times with modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and one time with phosphate-buffered saline. Immune complexes were solubilized in 30 μl of 2× Laemmli buffer, and samples were separated on 8 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk protein for 1 h and probed with primary antibody for 3 h at room temperature or at 4 °C overnight. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The densitometric scanning of films was done using a Bio-Rad Model G5–700 imaging densitometer. The Syk kinase assay was performed by first immunoprecipitating lysates with anti-Syk antibody. The immune complexes were then washed twice with radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and twice with Syk kinase buffer (20 mm Hepes, 50 mm NaCl, 10 μmNa3VO4, 5 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm MnCl2). The complex was incubated in Syk kinase buffer and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP for 20 min at 30 °C. The reaction was terminated by adding 4× SDS sample buffer and boiling the samples for 5 min at 100 °C. Proteins were then separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography. Rabbit IgG was used as a negative control. The RAFTK C-terminal domain (amino acids 681–1009)-glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein was produced as described (46.Ganju R.K. Hatch W.C. Avraham H. Ona M.A. Druker B. Avraham S. Groopman J.E. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 185: 1055-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Briefly, the fusion protein was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the pGEX-2T expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The GST fusion protein was produced by 1 mmisopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside induction and purified by affinity chromatography on a glutathione-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Grb2-GST fusion proteins were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. For the binding experiments, 5 μg of GST fusion protein were mixed with 1 mg of cell lysate and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C on a rotatory shaker. GST protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as a control. The complex was pre-absorbed by adding 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C on a rotatory shaker. The beads were centrifuged and washed three times with modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer and once with 1× phosphate-buffered saline. The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer and subjected to 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blot analysis. The assay was performed in 24-well plates containing 5-μm porosity inserts (Costar Corp., Cambridge, MA) as described (45.Ganju R.K. Brubaker S.A. Meyer J. Dutt P. Yang Y. Qin S. Newman W. Groopman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23169-23175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (559) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were resuspended at 6.6 × 106/ml in RPMI 1640 medium containing 2.5% bovine serum albumin. 50 ng of MIP1β were added to the bottom wells, and 150 μl of cells (1 × 106) untreated or pretreated with different concentrations of sodium orthovanadate were loaded onto the inserts. Cells migrating to the bottom wells were collected, centrifuged, and counted. The results shown are representative of findings from three independent experiments. Cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatases have been shown to be important positive and negative regulators of signaling pathways. To characterize the role that phosphatases play in CCR5-mediated signal transduction pathways, CCR5 transfectants were stimulated with MIP1β, and lysates were analyzed for SHP1 and SHP2 tyrosine phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 1 (A andC, respectively), MIP1β stimulation of CCR5 transfectants resulted in an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP1 and SHP2. Equal amounts of SHP1 and SHP2 proteins were present in each lane (Fig.1, A and C, lower panels). We also found that MIP1β stimulation induced a slight increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP1 and SHP2 (Fig. 1, B andD, respectively) in activated T-cells derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These T-cells were found to be ∼35% positive for CCR5 (data not shown). The reduced SHP1 and SHP2 phosphorylation in T-cells as compared with CCR5 L1.2 cells may be due to differences in the number of CCR5 receptors on these cells and/or to differences between the cell types. In addition, RAFTK has also been shown to have lower tyrosine phosphorylation in MIP1β-stimulated T-cells as compared with the similarly stimulated CCR5 L1.2 transfectants (15.Ganju R.K. Dutt P. Wu L. Newman W. Avraham H. Avraham S. Groopman J.E. Blood. 1998; 91: 791-797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tyr906 of RAFTK may act as a putative binding site for SHP proteins. Therefore, we examined the association of RAFTK with SHP1. As shown in Fig.2 A, SHP1 associated with RAFTK constitutively; this association was modestly increased upon MIP1β stimulation. To further confirm this association, we used a GST fusion protein containing the C-terminal domain of RAFTK. As shown in Fig.2 B, SHP1 was observed to associate with this fusion protein. SHP1 also associated with Grb2 upon MIP1β stimulation (Fig.2 C). Since SHP2 was also tyrosine-phosphorylated following MIP1β stimulation, we studied whether it associated with the adaptor protein Grb2. As shown in Fig. 2 D, SHP2 associated with Grb2, and this association increased upon chemokine stimulation. Since SHP1 was shown to associate with RAFTK upon MIP1β stimulation, we were interested in whether RAFTK modulated the MIP1β-stimulated phosphorylation of SHP1. To address this question, we created double-transfected L1.2 cells that expressed human CCR5 and RAFTKm906, in which Tyr906 was replaced with Phe. Tyr906 of RAFTK is a putative binding site for phosphatases. As shown in Fig.3 (A and B, respectively), there was no significant increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of SHP1 and SHP2 in the RAFTKm906transfectants as compared with the pcDNA transfectants. An equal amount of SHP1 and SHP2 proteins was present in all samples (Fig. 3,A and B, lower panels). Tyrosine phosphatases have been shown to play an important role in chemotaxis. To determine the potential role of phosphatases in MIP1β-stimulated chemotaxis, we examined MIP1β-induced migration in the presence of different concentrations of the phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate. As shown in Fig.4 (A and B, respectively), orthovanadate treatment attenuated the MIP1β-induced migration of CCR5 L1.2 cells and activated T-cells in a dose-dependent manner. 100 μm orthovanadate resulted in ∼85% inhibition of CCR5 L1.2 and ∼70% inhibition of T-cell chemotaxis. No effect on cell survival or growth was observed under similar conditions. The Src-related kinase Syk has been shown to participate in various signaling pathways regulating cell growth and adhesion. To characterize the role of Syk in CCR5-mediated signal transduction pathways, CCR5 transfectants or T-cells were stimulated with MIP1β, and the lysates were analyzed for Syk kinase activation. As shown in Fig. 5 A(upper panel), MIP1β stimulation of the CCR5 L1.2 transfectants resulted in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk. Equal amounts of Syk protein were present in each lane (Fig.5 A, lower panel). In addition, MIP1β stimulation induced Syk-autophosphorylating activity in CCR5 L1.2 transfectants (Fig. 5 B) and, to a lesser degree, in T-cells (Fig. 5 C). Similar to SHP1 and SHP2 phosphorylation, Syk-autophosphorylating activity was reduced in T-cells as compared with the CCR5 L1.2 transfectants upon MIP1β stimulation. To further characterize the role that Syk might play in CCR5-mediated signaling, we sought to identify proteins that associate with Syk upon MIP1β stimulation. We observed a constitutive association of Syk with RAFTK, an association that was enhanced upon MIP1β stimulation (Fig.6 A). RAFTK has previously been shown to be phosphorylated and activated by MIP1β (15.Ganju R.K. Dutt P. Wu L. Newman W. Avraham H. Avraham S. Groopman J.E. Blood. 1998; 91: 791-797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, Syk was also shown to associate with the SH2 domain of Grb2. This association was enhanced upon MIP1β stimulation (Fig. 6 B). Since we observed that Syk was activated and associated with RAFTK upon MIP1β stimulation, we subsequently studied the association of Syk with SHP1. As shown, Syk also associated with SHP1 (Fig.7), and this association was enhanced upon MIP1β stimulation.Figure 7SHP1 associates with Syk. Lysates from CCR5 L1.2 cells stimulated with MIP1β for different time periods as indicated were immunoprecipitated (IP) with SHP1 and run on SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The blots were subjected to serial blotting with Syk (upper panel), followed by blotting with SHP1 (lower panel). The C lanerepresents immunoprecipitates with control IgG. WB, Western blot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since RAFTK associated with Syk, we wanted to see whether this association was important for Syk activation. To address this question, we created double-transfected L1.2 cells that expressed human CCR5 and RAFTKm402 (which lacks the Src-binding site) or CCR5 and RAFTKWT. Up to a 3-fold increase in Syk activation was observed in the MIP1β-treated CCR5-RAFTKWT cells as compared with the pcDNA-transfected cells (Fig.8 A). We also observed an ∼2-fold decrease in Syk activity in the CCR5 L1.2 transfectants overexpressing the dominant-negative mutant RAFTKm402 as compared with transfectants expressing the pcDNA vector (Fig.8 B). These studies suggest that RAFTK may regulate Syk kinase activation in these cells. In our earlier studies using CCR5-transfected murine pre-B lymphoma L1.2 cells as a model, we have shown that MIP1β stimulation results in activation of RAFTK/Pyk2 (15.Ganju R.K. Dutt P. Wu L. Newman W. Avraham H. Avraham S. Groopman J.E. Blood. 1998; 91: 791-797Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, HIV gp120 binding to CCR5 and chemokine stimulation have also been shown to induce RAFTK/Pyk2 phosphorylation (16.Davis C.B. Dikic I. Unutmaz D. Hill C.M. Arthos J.

In the present study, we have further characterized the role of RAFTK and investigated the possible involvement of the phosphatases SHP1 and SHP2 and the Src-related kinase Syk in signaling pathways mediated by CCR5. Cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatases and Src-related kinases are known to modulate regulatory pathways of cell spreading, migration, and cytoskeletal organization (48.Qi J.H. Ito N. Claesson-Welsh L. J.

Both of these phosphatases have been shown to participate in various receptor-mediated pathways. SHP1 has been shown to act as a negative regulator of signaling pathways, whereas SHP2 appears to function as a positive mediator (17.Streuli M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 182-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 18.Neel B.G. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 405-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 21.Frearson J.A. Alexander D.R.

Recent studies of hematopoietic cells from motheaten mice indicate that SHP1 plays an important role in the regulation of the stromal cell-derived factor-1-induced signaling pathway (32.Kim C.H. Qu C.K. Hangoc G. Cooper S. Anzai N. Feng G.S. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 190: 681-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We have observed that SHP1 is associated with RAFTK. However, RAFTK does not appear to mediate the MIP1β-stimulated phosphorylation of SHP1 or SHP2 since overexpression of a dominant-negative phosphatase-binding mutant of RAFTK had little effect on MIP1β-stimulated SHP1 or SHP2 phosphorylation. We also observed that chemokine stimulation resulted in the enhanced association of SHP1 and SHP2 with Syk and Grb2. In different signaling pathways, SHP1 and SHP2 are known to associate with various signaling molecules, including Vav, Grb2, SOS, and SLP-76 via their SH2 domains (53.Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E.

In addition to their role as phosphatases, SHP1 and SHP2 may act as adaptor proteins by providing docking sites for the recruitment of downstream signaling molecules. The present study indicates that tyrosine phosphatases may play an important role in the regulation of MIP1β-induced migration, as orthovanadate treatment markedly attenuated MIP1β-stimulated chemotaxis. Recently, platelet-derived growth factor-induced migration was shown to be regulated by SHP2 (48.Qi J.H. Ito N. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14455-14463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). MIP1β stimulation also induced activation of Syk, a Src-related kinase. Syk has been shown to participate in signal transduction pathways mediated by B- and T-cell antigen receptors, the Fc receptor, various growth factor receptors, and integrin receptors (33.Poole A. Gibbins J.M. Turner M. van Vugt M.J. van de Winkel J.G. Saito T. Tybulewicz V.L. Watson S.P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2333-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 34.Latour S. Fournel M.

Tyr402 (autophosphorylation site) of RAFTK has been shown to bind to Src kinases, which results in their activation (40.Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (877) Google Scholar). In the present study, we observed that Syk associated with RAFTK and that this association was enhanced upon MIP1β stimulation. RAFTK association with another Src-related kinase, Fyn, has been shown to play an important role in mediating T-cell receptor signal transduction (46.Ganju R.K. Hatch W.C. Avraham H.

Furthermore, RANTES has been shown to induce ZAP-70 activity and its association with focal adhesion kinase in T-cells (58.Bacon K.B. Szabo M.C. Yssel H. Bolen J.B. Schall T.J. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 873-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). In this study, RAFTK appeared to partially mediate Syk activation, as overexpression of a Src-binding mutant of RAFTK resulted in the reduced activation of Syk, whereas overexpression of wild-type RAFTK enhanced Syk activity. Recently, Syk was shown to be upstream of RAFTK/Pyk2 phosphorylation in Fcε receptor-1-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in mast cells, whereas Pyk2 phosphorylation by thrombin and the adenosine G-protein-coupled receptor was independent of RAFTK/Pyk2 in these cells (59.Okazaki H. Zhang J. Hamawy M.M. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32443-32447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We also observed that Syk associated with SHP1 and that this association was enhanced by chemokine stimulation. Tyrosine phosphatases can cause activation of Src kinases (60.Somani A.K. Bignon J.S.

SHP1 has been shown to regulate Syk activity, as overexpression of SHP1-inactive mutants in B lymphoma cell lines results in enhanced Syk kinase activity (61.Dustin L.B. Plas D.R. Wong J. Hu Y.T.

Taken together, our results provide new information regarding various downstream signaling molecules involved in CCR5-mediated signaling pathways. We have found that MIP1β stimulation of CCR5 activates Syk and increases the tyrosine phosphorylation of the SH2-domain containing phosphatases SHP1 and SHP2. This results in the formation of a multimeric complex consisting of RAFTK, Syk, Grb2, and SHP1. RAFTK was shown to partially mediate the activation of Syk, but had no significant effect on SHP1 or SHP2 tyrosine phosphorylation. These results suggest that RAFTK differentially regulates several downstream signaling targets that are activated upon CCR5 stimulation.

https://openalex.org/W2078209051,"Ectodomain shedding of cell surface proteins is an important process in a wide variety of physiological and developmental events. Recently, tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme (TACE) has been found to play an essential role in the shedding of several critical surface proteins, which is evidenced by multiple developmental defects exhibited by TACE knockout mice. However, little is known about the physiological activation of TACE. Here, we show that nitric oxide (NO) activates TACE-mediated ectodomain shedding. Using anin vitro model of TACE activation, we show that NO activates TACE by nitrosation of the inhibitory motif of the TACE prodomain. Thus, NO production activates the release of cytokines, cytokine receptors, and adhesion molecules, and NO may be involved in other ectodomain shedding processes.

Nature. 1997; 385: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar). TACE has been shown to mediate cleavage of TNFα as well as a variety of ectodomains including the TNF p75 receptor, L-selectin, and transforming growth factor-α (3.Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Black R.A. Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). Despite its importance, the physiological regulation of TACE activity remains undefined. Endotoxin does not alter TACE transcription, steady-state mRNA levels, or the level of processed TACE at the cell surface (3.Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C.

Many metalloproteinases can be activated by oxidation and dissociation of the cysteine thiol-zinc linkage from a latent enzymatic site, with this complex referred to as a “cysteine zinc switch” mechanism (17.Springman E.B. Angleton E.L. Birkedal-Hansen H. Van Wart H.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). TACE contains a consensus cysteine switch motif in the prodomain, and it has been shown previously that the cysteine in this portion of the molecule is required for the inhibition of TACE activity (18.Milla M.E.

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that NO, a molecule produced in a variety of inflammatory conditions, regulates TACE activity and ectodomain shedding. (Z)-1-[N-(3-ammoniopropyl)-N-(n-propyl)-amino]-diazen- 1-ium-1,2-diolate (PAPA/NO), N G-monomethyl-l-arginine (NMA), and 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo-[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one were obtained from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Actinomycin D and oxyhemoglobin were from Sigma. Murine interferon-γ was provided by Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Escherichia coli LPS 026:B6 was from Difco. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Mono Mac 6 and Jurkat cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 with 15 and 5% fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), respectively. IEC-6 cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 5% fetal bovine serum. Mouse TACE ΔZn/ΔZn or control TACE +/+ monocytes were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, 20 ng/ml granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, and 100 μmβ-mercaptoethanol. Lung macrophages were obtained from 129 × C57BL/6 mice or iNOS −/− mice (19.Laubach V.E. Shesely E.G. Smithies O. Sherman P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10688-10692Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar) by lung lavage with warmed phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.5 mm EDTA. Cells were >95% viable macrophages (determined by trypan blue staining) and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. All media contained 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2. TNFα production was induced in Mono Mac 6 cells by stimulation with a combination of 20 ng/ml LPS and 60 ng/ml PMA for 3 h in the presence of varying concentrations of PAPA/NO. Experiments were also performed with and without 100 μm TAPI (Peptides International, Lexington, KY), a hydroxamate-based metalloproteinase inhibitor that tightly binds to metalloproteinase catalytic domain, or 5 μmoxyhemoglobin. To assess shedding of TNF p75 receptors (Mono Mac 6 cells) or L-selectin (Jurkat cells) by NO, cells were incubated with varying concentrations of PAPA/NO with and without 100 μmTAPI. Certain experiments were performed in the presence of 2 μg/ml actinomycin D to rule out a transcriptional effect of PAPA/NO on ectodomain shedding. IEC-6 cells, a rat intestinal epithelial cell line, were stimulated with both murine interferon-γ (10 units/ml) and LPS (20 ng/ml) for 18 h to induce NO production. NO production by this cell line was monitored by the Griess reaction assay. Then, Mono Mac 6 cells were co-cultured with this cell line in the presence of continuous murine interferon-γ and LPS stimulation for 3 h. Human TNF p75 receptors in the culture medium and Mono Mac 6 cell lysates were measured by ELISA. Experiments were also performed in the presence of 100 μm NMA or 5 μm HbO2 to antagonize NO production or activity, respectively. Cell lysates were prepared in a lysis buffer containing phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, 1% Triton X-100, and a proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cell lysates and supernatants were harvested at 2 h (TNF p75 receptors and L-selectin) or 3 h (TNFα). An ELISA was used to measure shed and cell-associated human TNFα, L-selectin (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), human TNF p75 receptors (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA), and mouse TNF p75 receptors (Genzyme, Cambridge, MA). Experiments with recombinant murine TNF p75 receptors and supernatants of PMA-stimulated mouse monocytes confirmed the specificity of the human TNF p75 receptor ELISA. Surface TACE was assessed by staining Mono Mac 6 cells with M222 (3.Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Black R.A. Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar), a monoclonal antibody against human TACE, or with isotype control followed by incubation with a secondary phycoerythrin-conjugated rat anti-mouse antibody (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Surface TNF p75 receptors were detected on TACE +/+ and TACE ΔZn/ΔZn by staining with a biotinylated hamster anti-mouse TNF p75 receptor (Genzyme) or with isotype control followed by incubation with streptavidin-phycoerythrin (PharMingen). Cells were analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACScalibur flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Purified TACE was a gift of Dr. Roy Black (Immunex Corp., Seattle, WA). TACE activity was determined by its ability to cleave a 12-amino acid peptide containing a known TACE cleavage site, SPLAQA*VHLPQP, with a dinitrophenyl group at the N terminus to enhance absorbance at 350 nm. TACE inhibitory peptide (TIP) was synthesized from the prodomain sequence PKVCGYLK (20.Roghani M. Becherer J.D. Moss M.L. Atherton R.E. Erdjument-Bromage H. Arribas J. Blackburn R.K. Weskamp G. Tempst P. Blobel C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3531-3540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). All reactions were initiated in 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) that had been sparged with argon. To inhibit TACE, TIP (1–500 μm) was incubated with TACE (340 nm) for 1 h at room temperature in 50 μl of buffer. To test the ability of the nitric oxide donor to reverse TACE inhibition, PAPA/NO (Alexis Biochemicals) was added to the solution for a final concentration of 0.5 or 1 mm (1 h, room temperature). Finally, 50 μl of a TACE cleavage peptide solution was added for a final concentration of 200 nm (15 min, 37 °C). The reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of 2n HCl. The peptide cleavage was determined using a Waters Alliance 9690 HPLC system equipped with a Nova Pak C18 column (Waters Corp., Milford, MA). Percent activity or inhibition was determined by analyzing the area under the curve of the HPLC trace. Nitrosation of the TIP and related compounds was determined at neutral pH with an absorbance reading at 335 nm (21.Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 521-539Google Scholar). Data were analyzed using StatView software (Carlsbad, CA). Differences between means were analyzed by analysis of variance with Fisher's follow-up testing.p < 0.05 was considered significant. To test the possible involvement of NO in activation of TACE, we added an exogenous source of NO, PAPA/NO, to LPS/PMA-stimulated Mono Mac 6 cells, a human monocytic cell line that expresses TACE (8.Moss M.L. Jin S.L. Milla M.E. Bickett D.M. Burkhart W. Carter H.L. Chen W.J. Clay W.C. Didsbury J.R. Hassler D. Hoffman C.R. Kost T.A. Lambert M.H. Leesnitzer M.A. McCauley P. McGeehan G. Mitchell J. Moyer M. Pahel G. Rocque W. Overton L.K. Schoenen F. Seaton T. Su J.L. Becherer J.D. Nature. 1997; 385: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar). This treatment resulted in a dose-dependent increase in secreted TNFα in the culture supernatant. This effect is due to the NO donor because these cells do not produce NO, and the enhanced secretion of TNFα by PAPA/NO is blocked by 5 μm oxyhemoglobin, a scavenger of free NO (Fig. 1 a). This enhanced secretion of TNFα is associated with a decrease in cell-associated TNFα 2 h after stimulation with LPS and PMA (Fig.1 b). Thus, at any given level of cell-associated TNFα over time, the level of secreted TNFα is higher in cells exposed to PAPA/NO (Fig. 1 c). Thus, NO enhances TNFα processing across the cell membrane. We did not observe significant differences in cell-associated TNFα at 3 h; however, this may be because NO stabilizes TNF mRNA (as reported by Wang et al. (12.Wang S. Yan L. Wesley R.A. Danner R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5959-5965Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)), resulting in an increase in cell-associated TNFα at this time point. TAPI, a metalloproteinase/TACE inhibitor, blocks both LPS/PMA-induced and NO-induced increases in TNFα processing (data not shown). These data suggest that NO can enhance TNF processing by enhancing TACE activity. Unlike TNFα, which requires transcriptional stimulation by LPS and PMA (a known activator of TACE activity) in Mono Mac 6 cells, we investigated whether NO can activate shedding of constitutive TACE-dependent ectodomains. Specifically, we quantitated the shedding of TNF p75 receptor from Mono Mac 6 cells and of L-selectin from Jurkat T cells. Both of these ectodomains are cleaved by TACE (3.Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Black R.A. Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). Therefore, releases of preformed TNF p75 receptor and L-selectin were used as sensitive markers for TACE cell surface activity (3.Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Black R.A. Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar) and do not require transcriptional activation or confounding complications associated with PMA stimulation. When Mono Mac 6 cells were exposed to PAPA/NO, we observed a dose-dependent shedding of the TNF p75 receptor from the cell surface over a 2-h time period (Fig.2 a). These concentrations of PAPA/NO, which result in steady-state NO concentrations in the micromolar range (22.Wink D.A. Cook J.A. Krishna M.C. Hanbauer I. DeGraff W. Gamson J. Mitchell J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 319: 402-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), did not cause cytotoxicity as defined by lactate dehydrogenase release (data not shown). Moreover, soluble TNF p75 receptor shedding from Mono Mac 6 cells was completely blocked by TAPI (Fig. 2 a), and shedding was not observed with degraded PAPA/NO. To rule out the possibility that PAPA/NO enhanced TNF p75 receptor transcription and production, cell-associated TNF p75 receptors were measured in the cell lysates, which showed that PAPA/NO treatment caused a dose-dependent decrease of cell-associated TNF p75 receptor (Fig. 2 b). Incubation of Mono Mac 6 cells with PAPA/NO in the presence of 2 μg/ml actinomycin D did not alter NO-induced shedding of the TNF p75 receptor. NO-induced shedding was blocked by HbO2 (Fig. 2 c). Such a reciprocal change of shed versus cell-associated TNF p75 receptors in PAPA/NO-treated cells demonstrates that NO caused TNF p75 receptor cleavage from the cell membrane independent of transcriptional activity. In further support of NO activation of TACE-mediated ectodomain shedding, we observed PAPA/NO-mediated release of L-selectin from the surface of Jurkat T-cells (Fig. 2 d). As was the case for TNF p75 receptor shedding in Mono Mac 6 cells, no increase in shedding is observed with the parental compound, degraded PAPA/NO, or in the presence of TAPI (data not shown). NO-induced shedding was also seen after treatment of the cells with a nitrosothiol NO donor,S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, at a 20-fold lower concentration (5 μm). This effect was not blocked by HbO2, which demonstrates that NO-induced TACE-mediated ectodomain shedding can also occur via transnitrosation (23.Jia L. Bonaventura C. Bonaventura J. Stamler J.S. Nature. 1996; 380: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1480) Google Scholar). To investigate whether endogenous NO can activate TACE-mediated ectodomain shedding, we induced TNF p75 receptor shedding in lung macrophages from control mice or inducible nitric oxide synthase knockout (iNOS −/−) mice (19.Laubach V.E. Shesely E.G. Smithies O. Sherman P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10688-10692Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation with 20 ng/ml LPS, the control cells produced between 10 and 50 μm NO (data not shown). LPS-induced NO production was associated with a significant increase in TNF p75 receptor shedding (Fig. 3 a). However, iNOS −/− macrophages failed to make detectable NO, and they did not shed TNF p75 receptors (Fig. 3 a) despite the presence of TACE and TNF p75 receptors on the cell surface as measured by flow cytometry (Fig.3 b). To investigate whether NO can act in a paracrine fashion to increase TACE activity in human macrophages, which do not produce NO in culture, we co-cultured Mono Mac 6 cells with a rat intestinal epithelial cell line, IEC-6 cells, which produce NO under stimulation with murine interferon-γ and LPS (24.Dignass A.U. Podolsky D.K. Rachmilewitz D. Dig. Dis. Sci. 1995; 40: 1859-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 25.Panja A. Goldberg S. Eckmann L. Krishen P. Mayer L. J. Immunol. 1998; 161: 3675-3684PubMed Google Scholar). After 18 h, NO production by IEC-6 cells was confirmed by Griess reactivity after reduction of nitrate to nitrite. Stimulated cells produced 10.68 ± 1.27 μm nitrate plus nitrite compared with 2.52 ± 0.42 μm in unstimulated cells and 2.98 ± 1.28 μm in stimulated cells in the presence of 1 mm NMA (a competitive inhibitor of NO synthase). A 5-h co-culture of Mono Mac 6 cells with stimulated IEC-6 cells resulted in significant human TNF p75 receptor shedding from Mono Mac 6 cells compared with co-culture with unstimulated IEC-6 cells (Fig.3 c). Direct treatment of Mono Mac 6 cells with murine interferon-γ and LPS did not alter human TNF p75 receptor shedding (112 ± 9.8 pg/ml/5 h versus 120 ± 13.6 pg/ml/5 h in control cells). HbO2 (5 μm) inhibited activation of TNFα p75 receptor shedding (Fig. 3 c), confirming the direct role of NO in TACE activation. Although TACE mediates TNF p75 receptor and L-selectin shedding (3.Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Black R.A. Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar), other sheddases could contribute to TNF p75 receptor shedding under these conditions. To further define that the ectodomain shedding facilitated by NO is mediated by TACE specifically, we utilized monocytes derived from mice with a targeted mutation (TACE ΔZn/ΔZn) encoding an in-frame deletion of the zinc binding domain in the TACE gene (3.Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Black R.A. Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). This domain is essential for TACE activity, and TACE ΔZn/ΔZn cells have been shown to be deficient in the processing of TACE cleavage substrates (3.Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E. Castner B.J. Johnson R.S. Fitzner J.N. Boyce R.W. Nelson N. Kozlosky C.J. Wolfson M.F. Rauch C.T. Cerretti D.P. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Black R.A. Science. 1998; 282: 1281-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar). In the control monocytic cell line (TACE +/+), PAPA/NO resulted in dose-dependent shedding of the TNF p75 receptor (Fig.4 a). In support of the role of NO in TACE-mediated ectodomain shedding, both HbO2 and 2,3-diaminonaphthalene (DAN) blocked PAPA/NO-induced TNF p75 receptor shedding in these cells (Fig. 4 b). Autoxidation of NO in the presence of oxygen forms the nitrosating compound, N2O3, which reacts with and is neutralized by DAN (26.Okamoto T. Akaike T. Nagano T. Miyajima S. Suga M. Ando M. Ichimori K. Maeda H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 342: 261-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). NO-induced TNF p75 receptor shedding was not observed in TACE ΔZn/ΔZn monocytes (Fig. 4 a). NO-induced TNF p75 receptor shedding in the wild type TACE +/+ cells was corroborated by analyzing TACE ΔZn/ΔZn and TACE +/+ cells by flow cytometry for surface TNF p75 receptor expression. PAPA/NO (1 mm) resulted in a significant decrease in the mean channel fluorescence for surface TNF p75 receptor in TACE +/+ cells (Fig. 4 c, left panel) but caused no change in surface TNF p75 receptor expression in TACE ΔZn/ΔZn cells (Fig. 4 c, right panel). NO is well known as a signal transduction molecule, exerting many of its biological activities. However, NO-induced ectodomain shedding did not appear to require any of the known potential signaling pathways for NO. NO-induced TNF p75 receptor shedding was not affected by an inhibitor of cyclic GMP (1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo-[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one), 8-bromo cyclic GMP, chelerythrin (a calcium-dependent protein kinase C inhibitor), genistein (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor), or dibutryl cyclic AMP, which increases intracellular cAMP (data not shown). Moreover, flow cytometry analysis with a monoclonal antibody against the catalytic domain of TACE revealed that PAPA/NO does not alter the TACE signal on the cell surface (mean channel fluorescence, 53 ± 4.3 versus 55 ± 5.2 after a 2-h exposure to 1 mm PAPA/NO). These data suggest that NO increases ectodomain shedding by direct activation of latent TACE. Further experiments on the activation of TACE by NO were performed using a recombinant processed TACE that lacks the prodomain and is constitutively active (7.Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N. Boiani N. Schooley K.A. Gerhart M. Davis R. Fitzner J.N. Johnson R.S. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar). Incubation of this protein with NO resulted in no further enhancement of TACE activity using a peptide cleavage assay (7.Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N. Boiani N. Schooley K.A. Gerhart M. Davis R. Fitzner J.N. Johnson R.S. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar) (data not shown). However, these data do not exclude the possibility that NO could nitrosate the thiol in the prodomain covering the catalytically active site and thereby activate latent TACE. To test this possibility, we constructed an in vitro model of unprocessed TACE using recombinant active TACE in combination with a TIP. This peptide, PKVCGYLK, contains the consensus cysteine switch motif of the TACE prodomain that inhibits TACE activity, as described previously (7.Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J.

A TACE cleavage peptide (TCP), which contains the TNFα TACE cleavage site (7.Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S.

Prior N-terminal sequencing has confirmed that TACE cleaves this peptide at the alanine/valine site in the TCP (7.Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N. Boiani N. Schooley K.A. Gerhart M. Davis R. Fitzner J.N. Johnson R.S. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar). The uncleaved TCP migrated as a single peak that eluted at approximately 18 min by HPLC (Fig.5). Incubation of TCP with TACE (15 min, 37 °C) resulted in almost complete cleavage of the TCP (95 ± 1.2%) with a distinct cleavage product that eluted at approximately 17 min. Preincubation of TACE with TIP significantly decreased TACE activity to 20 ± 2.6% cleavage of the TCP (Fig. 5,n = 5). Incubating the TACE·TIP complex with 1 mm PAPA/NO reversed the inhibitory effect of TIP, restoring the cleavage of TCP to 91 ± 3.1% (Fig. 5). Incubation of TIP alone with PAPA/NO prior to incubation with TACE also abolished the inhibitory effect of TIP (data not shown). The inhibitory action of TIP exposed to PAPA/NO was reconstituted by subsequent addition of 1 mm dithiothreitol (data not shown). These data are consistent with nitrosothiol formation at the cysteine of the inhibitory motif of the prodomain, which thereby prevents the thiol group from coordinating with the Zn2+ atom in the catalytic site of TACE. To confirm nitrosation of the cysteine of the prodomain of TACE as a regulatory mechanism of TACE activation, we analyzed nitrosothiol formation of TIP using HPLC with an absorbance at 335 nm (21.Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 521-539Google Scholar). Incubation of TIP with NaNO2 in the presence of 0.12n HCl (positive control for nitrosothiol formation) or with 1 mm PAPA/NO (1 h, room temperature) resulted in a nitrosothiol product that eluted at 10 min (Fig.6). Untreated TIP or PAPA/NO alone resulted in no absorbance peak at 335 nm (Fig. 6). Consistent with a nitrosated product, the absorbance peak of TIP incubated with PAPA/NO was extinguished by 10 mm HgCl2, which removes NO from the nitrosated thiol (21.Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Feelisch M. Stamler J.S. Methods in Nitric Oxide Research. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1996: 521-539Google Scholar). These results indicate that NO can directly nitrosate TACE prodomain, leading to activation of latent TACEin vitro. Most matrix metalloproteinases and ADAMs are synthesized in a latent form (27.Massova I. Kotra L.P. Fridman R. Mobashery S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1075-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar, 28.Wolfsberg T.G. Primakoff P. Myles D.G. White J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). This latency is the result of an intramolecular complex between the cysteine residue in the zinc switch domain and the zinc atom in the catalytic domain. The amino acid sequences surrounding the critical cysteine residue and the region containing two of the putative histidine zinc-binding ligands are highly conserved (27.Massova I. Kotra L.P. Fridman R. Mobashery S. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1075-1095Crossref PubMed Scopus (704) Google Scholar). Several reactive free radicals (including NO and other reactive nitrogen oxides) have been suggested to activate metalloproteinases via attack of the cysteine thiol group in the zinc switch thereby exposing the active zinc site (26.Okamoto T.

Although this mechanism is operative in many matrix metalloproteinases, this regulation has not been shown for activation of members of the ADAM family of metalloproteinases. Alkylation of this prodomain thiol by 4-aminophenylmercuric acetate can activate full-length recombinant TACE in solution (18.Milla M.E. Leesnitzer M.A. Moss M.L. Clay W.C. Carter H.L. Miller A.B. Su J.L. Lambert M.H. Willard D.H. Sheeley D.M. Kost T.A. Burkhart W. Moyer M. Blackburn R.K. Pahel G.L. Mitchell J.L. Hoffman C.R. Becherer J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30563-30570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, whether the modification of the cysteine residue in the inhibitory prodomain plays a physiological role in regulation of TACE activity has not been shown. In these studies, we demonstrate that NO provided by a NO donor or generated in a physiological setting (either endogenously or exogenously produced) is a critical factor in TACE-mediated ectodomain shedding. This is the first time that NO has been shown to activate ectodomain shedding and play a role in the physiological regulation of TACE activity. Moreover we have shown that NO can form a nitrosothiol with the cysteine residue in the inhibitory prodomain of TACE, which results in an enzymatically active form of TACE in vitro. In addition to the cysteine switch complex, TACE contains another cysteine-rich domain near its transmembrane segment (7.Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S. Nelson N. Boiani N. Schooley K.A. Gerhart M. Davis R. Fitzner J.N. Johnson R.S. Paxton R.J. March C.J. Cerretti D.P. Nature. 1997; 385: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar). Chemical modification of this cysteine-rich domain has been shown to affect TACE enzymatic activity (18.Milla M.E. Leesnitzer M.A. Moss M.L. Clay W.C. Carter H.L. Miller A.B. Su J.L. Lambert M.H. Willard D.H. Sheeley D.M. Kost T.A. Burkhart W. Moyer M. Blackburn R.K. Pahel G.L. Mitchell J.L. Hoffman C.R. Becherer J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30563-30570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Thus, nitrosation of thiol groups in this domain could also contribute to the enhancement of TACE-mediated ectodomain shedding by NO. In the present study, we found that direct incubation of recombinant TACE with NO did not alter TACE-mediated cleavage. However, NO restored TACE enzymatic activity inhibited by a peptide mimicking TACE prodomain, suggesting that NO activates TACE via alteration of the cysteine switch. Cell surface TACE is reported to be active in the unstimulated condition (7.Black R.A. Rauch C.T. Kozlosky C.J. Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Wolfson M.F. Castner B.J. Stocking K.L. Reddy P. Srinivasan S.

Nature. 1997; 385: 729-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (2728) Google Scholar), and active TACE presumably maintains a basal level of ectodomain shedding, which is required for normal cell growth and metabolism. Nevertheless, LPS or protein kinase C activation can further enhance TACE-mediated ectodomain shedding (3.Peschon J.J. Slack J.L. Reddy P. Stocking K.L. Sunnarborg S.W. Lee D.C. Russell W.E.

Nature. 1997; 385: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1490) Google Scholar). Upon situations such as inflammation, it is feasible that NO and other factors up-regulate sheddases to regulate cell signaling and adhesion. In fact, it has been previously demonstrated that NO is a critical regulator of cell adhesion to the endothelium (32.Hickey M.J. Sharkey K.A. Sihota E.G. Reinhardt P.H. MacMicking J.D. Nathan C. Kubes P. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 955-964Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 33.Lefer D.J. Jones S.P. Girod W.G. Baines A. Grisham M.B. Cockrell A.S. Huang P.L. Scalia R. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: H1943-H1950PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we did not observe an increase in cell surface TACE by NO at the level of flow cytometry. Since NO is a cell membrane-diffusible molecule, we postulate that NO activates an intracellular pool of preformed latent TACE. In addition, the large diffusion distance of NO in tissue suggests activation of ectodomain shedding in multiple cells by a single cell producing NO (34.Lancaster Jr., J.R. Nitric Oxide. 1997; 1: 18-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). In summary, these findings suggest a novel role for NO in modulating TACE-dependent cytokine secretion, cytokine responsiveness, and ectodomain shedding and partially explain the augmented adhesion of leukocytes in the setting of reduced levels of NO (32.Hickey M.J.

A minor 420-kDa form of fibrinogen (fibrinogen 420) has an alternative extended form (the αE chain), which has a C-terminal domain (designated αEC) whose sequence is highly homologous to those of the βC and γC domains (3.Fu Y.

The αIIbβ3-fibrinogen interaction is critically involved in aggregation of activated platelets during thrombus formation. The γC dodecapeptide sequence (HHLGGAKQAGDV400–411) is required for fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3 (Ref. 5.Farrell D.H. Thiagarajan P. J. Biol.

Fibrin binding to integrin αvβ3 expressed on endothelial cells is important for angiogenesis associated with wound healing and tumorigenicity (9.Brooks P. Clark R. Cheresh D. Science. 1994; 264: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (2723) Google Scholar, 10.Clark R.A. Tonnesen M.G. Gailit J. Cheresh D.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1407-1421PubMed Google Scholar). We recently reported that αvβ3 specifically binds to fibrinogen C-terminal domains (γC and αEC) (11.Yokoyama K. Zhang X.-P. Medved L. Takada Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5872-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). This indicates that fibrinogen has multiple αvβ3 binding sites in the C-terminal domains, in addition to the previously identified RGD572–574 in the α chain (12.Cheresh D.A. Berliner S.A. Vicente V. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1989; 58: 945-953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 13.Smith R.A. Mosesson M.W. Rooney M.M. Lord S.T. Daniels A.U. Gartner T.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22080-22085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the γC dodecapeptide sequence is not required for γC binding to αvβ3, suggesting that this interaction is distinct from αIIbβ3-γC interaction that requires the dodecapeptide sequence (5.Farrell D.H. Thiagarajan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 226-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus it is imperative to study αvβ3-fibrinogen γC interaction to understand how this process is regulated during angiogenesis, wound healing and tumorigenicity. Tenascin C is a modular hexameric extracellular matrix glycoprotein, and is composed of six identical subunits that are made up of repeated sequence motifs that fold independently into small globular domains. The most prominent structural domains are the tenascin-type EGF-like repeats, the fibronectin type III repeats, and the C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain (TNfbg). Shenk et al. recently reported that TNfbg (but not fibronectin type III repeats, or EGF-like domain) contributes to phenotypic changes of endothelial cells occurring in early angiogenesis, i.e. sprouting (14.Schenk S. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Battegay E.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). They found that tenascin C is specifically expressed by sprouting and cord-forming endothelial cells but not by nonsprouting endothelial cells, and that TNfbg is responsible for reduced cell adhesion of endothelial cells on tenascin C substrates. It has not, however, been established which receptor(s) (integrin or non-integrin) interact with TNfbg. It has been reported that αvβ3 binds to tenascin C, but αvβ3-binding site in tenascin C has been mapped to the third fibronectin type III repeat (15.Joshi P. Chung C., I, A. Erickson H. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 389-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This repeat contains an RGD-sequence in human and chicken but not in mouse (16.Jones F.S. Burgoon M.P. Hoffman S. Crossin K.L.

Chem. 1991; 266: 2818-2823Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Species variation as well as the observation that this RGD may be a cryptic site, covered up by the adjacent second fibronectin type III repeat (15.Joshi P. Chung C., I, A. Erickson H. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 389-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), raised questions about the functional significance of an RGD-dependent cell binding to the third fibronectin type III repeat. In the present paper, we have localized the αvβ3 binding sites in γC and TNfbg using synthetic peptides and recombinant proteins. We found that two γC-derived peptides GWTVFQKRLDGSV190–202 and GVYYQGGTYSKAS346–358 block the αvβ3 binding to γC and αEC, block the αvβ3-mediated clot retraction, and induce the ligand-induced binding site 2 (LIBS2)1 epitope in αvβ3. Both sequences are located next to each other in the crystal structure, and several residues (Asp-199, Ser-201, Gln-350, Thr-353, Lys-356, Ala-357, and Ser-358) in both sequences are exposed to the surface. We also found that TNfbg specifically binds to αvβ3. Notably a tenascin C C-terminal fibrinogen-like domain (TNfbg) peptide WYRNCHRVNLMGRYGDNNHSQGVNWFHWKG (peptide VIII), which is in a similar predicted position in a three-dimensional-fold to γC GVYYQGGTYSKAS346–358, specifically binds to αvβ3. These results suggests that fibrinogen and tenascin C C-terminal domains specifically bind to αvβ3 in a similar manner, and these interactions may have potential biological significance in transducing signals from fibrinogen and tenascin C.

Refolding the expressed protein has been erratic, with yields ranging from 10 to 70% of the expressed protein recovered as a soluble peak from the mono S column. We report here our current protocol. The pellet from a 1-liter lysed culture was washed twice with 20 ml of lysis buffer containing 2 m urea and repelleted, resulting in significant purification. In the first wash, Mg2+, DNase, and Triton were added (the extra DNase seems important to reduce DNA contamination, which has been substantial in some preparations). The pellet from the second wash was then suspended in 20 ml of 4 m guanidine HCl in 0.02 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing 5 mm dithiothreitol. The resuspended pellet was centrifuged to remove insoluble material and then dialyzed twice against 9 volumes of 2 m guanidine HCl with no dithiothreitol. A glutathione redox mixture (GSH/GSSG) consisting of 1 mm reduced and 0.3 mm oxidized glutathione was added to this final dialysis mixture. The concentration of guanidine HCl was then slowly reduced by pumping 0.02 mTris-HCl, pH 8.0, containing the same GSH/GSSG mixture into the dialysis container. At 1 m guanidine HCl a modest precipitate usually formed in the dialysis bag. The slow dialysis was continued after decanting half of the dialysis buffer. When the guanidine HCl concentration was down to 0.5 m, the dialysis buffer was discarded, and the protein was dialyzed against several changes of 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, with no glutathione. Experiments not shown revealed that about half the TNfbg had 2 molecules of glutathione attached (and presumably one of the disulfides not formed). To remove these we dialyzed the protein against 1 mm dithiothreitol in 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, then against several changes of 0.02 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, adding 0.1 μm copper sulfate to the final dialysis to catalyze oxidation of the sulfhydryls. A final purification on mono S gave a single peak eluting at 0.075 m NaCl. Wells of a 96-well microtiter plate were coated with ligands in 100 μl of phosphate-buffered saline at 4 °C overnight. Nonspecific protein binding sites were blocked by incubating with 5% skim milk for 1 h at room temperature. Cells (1 × 10 6/ml) were incubated with peptides in Hepes-Tyrode buffer (10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 0.4 mmNaH2PO4, 2.5 mm KCl, 0.1% glucose, 0.02% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) containing 1 mmMg2+ at room temperature for 15 min, then added to the wells (100 μl each). After incubation at 37 °C for 1 h, wells were gently washed three times with the same buffer to remove unbound cells. Bound cells were quantified using endogenous phosphatase activity (21.Takagi J.

Human fibrinogen (Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN) was labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) according to the method described by Gotoet al. (24.Goto S. Salomon D.R. Ikeda Y.

Cells were incubated with 500 μmpeptide in 50 μl of Hepes-Tyrode buffer pH 7.4 containing 1 mm Mg2+ and 1 mm Ca2+at room temperature for 15 min. Then FITC-labeled fibrinogen (200 μg/ml) in 50 μl of the same buffer was added and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Cells were washed with the same buffer and analyzed by flow cytometry. αvβ3-Mediated clot retraction was performed according to the methods described by Katagiriet al. (25.Katagiri Y. Hiroyama T.

Ruggeri Z.M. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5070-5077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (5 × 105/ml) were incubated with 1 mm peptide in 500 μl of Hepes-Tyrode buffer, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm Mg2+ and 2 mmCa2+ at room temperature for 15 min, then fibrinogen (250 μg/ml) and aprotinin (3 μg/ml) were added to the cell suspension. After incubation at 37 °C for 5 min, thrombin (1 units/ml) was added to the cell suspension. The cell suspension was incubated at 37 °C for 6 h. Cells were incubated with 500 μm peptide in 50 μl of Hepes-Tyrode buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm Mg2+ at room temperature for 15 min. Then 50 μl of anti-LIBS2 antibody (500 times diluted ascites) in the same buffer was added to the cell suspension and incubated on ice for 20 min. After washing with the same buffer, FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody was added to the cell suspension. Cells were incubated on ice for 20 min, then analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells were incubated with 500 μm peptide in 50 μl of Hepes-Tyrode buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm Mn2+ at room temperature for 15 min. Then 50 μl of LM609 or 16N7C2 (500× diluted ascites) in Hepes-Tyrode buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mmMn2+ was added, and the cell suspension was incubated on ice for 20 min. After washing with the same Hepes-Tyrode buffer, FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody was added. Cells were incubated on ice for 20 min, then analyzed by flow cytometry. To localize the αvβ3 binding sites in γC, we studied the effect of several γC-derived peptides on αvβ3-γC interaction. Based on the crystal structure of γC (2.Yee V.C. Pratt K.P. Cote H.C. Trong I.L. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 125-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), we chose several prominent loops of γC that are exposed to the surface of the molecule (TableI). We synthesized peptides that correspond to these sequences and studied their ability to block αvβ3-mediated cell adhesion. We also tested γC190–202 (P1) (7.Altieri D.C. Plescia J. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1847-1853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and γC383–395 (P2-C) peptides (8.Ugarova T.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Loukinov D.I. Yee V.C. Medved L.V. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22519-22527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), which have been reported to inhibit αMβ2 binding to fibrinogen (Table I). We used β3-CHO cells, which express hamster αv/human β3 hybrid and specifically adhere to recombinant γC and αEC (11.Yokoyama K. Zhang X.-P. Medved L. Takada Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5872-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Parent CHO cells express endogenous α5β1, αvβ1, and αvβ5but no αvβ3; parent CHO cells do not adhere to recombinant γC or αEC (11.Yokoyama K. Zhang X.-P. Medved L. Takada Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5872-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Among the peptides tested, we found that GWTVFQKRLDGSV (γC190–202) and GVYYQGGTYSKAS (γC346–358) block β3-CHO cell adhesion to γC and αEC (Fig. 1). Inhibition of β3-CHO cell adhesion to γC and αEC by both peptides is in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1,B and C). A control peptide with a scrambled γC190–202 sequence FRLGWVQTSVDKG (designated γC190–202scr) or one with an inverted γC346–358 sequence SAKSYTGGQYYVG (designated γC346–358inv) did not significantly inhibit αvβ3 binding to γC and αEC (Fig. 1, B and C). These results suggest that inhibition of αvβ3 binding to γC and αEC by γC190–202 and γC346–358 peptides is sequence-specific. These results suggest that residues 190–202 and 346–358 may include part of αvβ3 binding sites. 202 and γC346–358 Peptides—It has been reported that mammalian cells expressing αvβ3 support fibrin clot retraction, and the αvβ3-mediated clot retraction is not dependent on the fibrinogen α chain RGD572–574 sequence or the γ chain AGDV408–411 sequence (13.Smith R.A.

We studied whether the γC190–202 and γC346–358 peptides affect the αvβ3-mediated clot retraction. GRGDS peptide and LM609 (anti-αvβ3) blocked M21 melanoma cell-mediated fibrin clot retraction (Fig.2), confirming that this clot retraction is mediated by αvβ3. We found that γC190–202 and γC346–358 peptides blocked the αvβ3-mediated clot retraction, but control peptides, γC190–202scr, γC346–358inv, or γC383–395 did not. These results indicate that the γC190–202 and γC346–358 peptides inhibit αvβ3-mediated clot retraction in a sequence-specific manner. It has been reported that ligand binding to αvβ3 induces LIBSs (20.Du X. Gu M. Weisel J. Nagaswami C. Bennett J. Bowditch R. Ginsberg M. J. Biol.

Rosenthal L.A. Stewart G.J. Niewiarowski S. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 225: 132-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We studied whether the γC190–202 and γC346–358 peptides induce expression of LIBS2 epitope (located immediately N-terminal to the transmembrane domain of β3) (20.Du X. Gu M. Weisel J. Nagaswami C. Bennett J. Bowditch R. Ginsberg M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23087-23092Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in αvβ3. γC190–202 and γC346–358 peptides induced expression of the LIBS2 epitope in αvβ3. GRGDS peptide used as a positive control also induced expression of the LIBS2 epitope in αvβ3 (Fig.3). However, γC190–202scr, γC346–358inv, and γC216–224 used as negative controls had little or no effect on expression of the LIBS2 epitope. These results suggest that the γC190–202 and γC346–358 peptides actually directly interact with αvβ3 and induce conformational changes of the receptor as on ligand binding. It has been reported that ligands (e.g. echistatin) or RGD-containing peptides block binding of an RGD-containing anti-β3 antibody, 16N7C2, to β3 integrin (19.Deckmyn H. Stanssens P. Hoet B. Declerck P.J. Lauwereys M. Gansemans Y. Tornai I. Vermylen J. Br. J. Haematol. 1994; 87: 562-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We recently found that a human-to-mouse (the W129S/N133T) mutation of β3completely blocks binding of 16N7C2 to αvβ3(31.Puzon-McLaughlin W. Kamata T. Takada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7795-7802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This suggests that the epitope of this antibody overlaps with the putative RGD binding site of β3(DDLW126–129) (32.Pasqualini R. Koivunen E. Ruoslahti E. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1189-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). We studied whether γC190–202 and γC346–358 peptides affect 16N7C2 binding to β3-CHO cells. GRGDS peptide blocked 16N7C2 binding to β3-CHO cells, but γC190–202 or γC346–358 did not (Fig.4). None of these peptides blocked LM609 (anti-αvβ3) binding to β3-CHO cells. These results suggest that γC190–202 or γC346–358 peptides does not compete with GRGDS peptide for binding to αvβ3. αIIbβ3, another fibrinogen receptor, requires the γC dodecapeptide sequence HHLGGAKQAGDV400–411 for binding to γC. In contrast, αvβ3 does not require the γC dodecapeptide sequence for binding to γC. However, whether the two fibrinogen receptors share any common binding sites in γC has not been established. We studied whether γC190–202 and γC346–358 peptides block fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3. αIIbβ3-CHO cells express both human αIIbβ3 and hamster αv/human β3 hybrid. We used activating anti-αIIbβ3 mAb PT25–2 to activate αIIbβ3 but not αvβ3 (18.Tokuhira M. Handa M. Kamata T. Oda A. Katayama M. Tomiyama Y. Murata M. Kawai Y. Watanabe K. Ikeda Y. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 1038-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). GRGDS peptide blocked FITC-labeled fibrinogen binding to activated αIIbβ3, but neither γC190–202 nor γC346–358 peptide affected this binding (Fig.5). These results suggest that these sequences may not be critically involved in αIIbβ3-γC interaction. We have studied whether the recombinant TNfbg binds to αvβ3. We found that the TNfbg supports adhesion of β3-CHO cells expressing αvβ3 but did not support adhesion of parent CHO cells (Fig. 6). β3-CHO cells adhered to TNfbg in a dose-dependent manner, but parent CHO cells did not. β3-CHO cells did not spread after incubation for 1 h on TNfbg. Adhesion of β3-CHO cells to TNfbg was inhibited by RGD peptide, EDTA, and LM609, a function blocking anti-αvβ3antibody (Fig. 6), suggesting that αvβ3specifically binds to TNfbg. Furthermore, β3-CHO cell adhesion to TNfbg was inhibited by γC190–202 and γC346–358 but not by several control peptides. These results suggest that γC, αEC, and TNfbg recognition sites in αvβ3 may locate close to each other (Fig.6 B). LaFleur et al. (33.LaFleur D.W. Chiang J. Fagin J.A. Schwartz S.M. Shah P.K.

Chem. 1997; 272: 32798-32803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) report that aortic smooth muscle cells interact with TNfbg, and a peptide derived from TNfbg, WYRNCHRVNLMGRYGDNNHSQGVNWFHWKG (peptide VIII), inhibits this interaction. They have shown that aortic smooth muscle cells adhere to the peptide VIII (33.LaFleur D.W. Chiang J. Fagin J.A. Schwartz S.M. Shah P.K. Wallner K. Forrester J.S. Sharifi B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32798-32803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) but did not show whether this interaction is mediated by integrins. A structure-based alignment of fibrinogen-like domains shows that peptide VIII includes the region of GVYYQGGTYSKAS346–358 of γC. These sequences may reside in a similar predicted location in the three-dimensional fold but in fact have little or no similarity between them. GRYG of peptide VIII aligns with GVYY of 346–358, but the remainder of the fibrinogen-γ sequence, QGGTYSKAS, has no matching segment in most of the fibrinogen-related proteins, including tenascins. This segment apparently corresponds to a loop on fibrinogen γ not present in tenascins. Although the structural relation of fibrinogen γ and tenascin C is not obvious at this region, we nevertheless studied whether peptide VIII binds to αvβ3. We found that β3-CHO cells specifically adhered to peptide VIII in a dose-dependent manner, but parent CHO cells did not. Adhesion to peptide VIII was blocked by EDTA, LM609, and GRGDS, γC346–358, and γC190–202 peptides but not by several control peptides. These results suggest that the peptide VIII sequence in tenascin C fibrinogen-like domain may be involved in αvβ3-tenascin C interaction. It is likely that the fibrinogen γC346–358 and γC190–202 peptides, and tenascin C peptide VIII share a common binding site in αvβ3. In the present study we provided evidence that two γC-derived peptides, γC190–202 and γC346–358, 1) block the αvβ3 binding to γC and αEC, 2) block the αvβ3-mediated fibrin clot retraction, and 3) induce the LIBS2 epitope in αvβ3. These results suggest that residues 190–202 and 346–358 of fibrinogen γ chain may be directly involved in αvβ3-γC interaction. Control peptide γC190–202scr and γC346–358inv did not inhibit αvβ3 binding to γC, indicating that the effect of the γC190–202 and γC346–358 is sequence-specific. We found the scrambled control peptide γC346–358scr weakly inhibited αvβ3 binding to γC and weakly induced the LIBS2 epitope in αvβ3 (data not shown), suggesting that the scrambled peptide still has some functional similarity to γC346–358. This is probably because randomizing the γC346–358 sequence (that contains three Tyr, three Gly, and two Ser residues within the 13-amino acid sequence) was incomplete. We found that both γC190–202 and γC346–358 sequences are located next to each other in the γC crystal structure, although they are separate in the primary structure (Fig. 7). It should be noted that peptides which do not block αvβ3-γC interaction cover most of the surface area of γC. Interestingly, both active peptides GWTVFQKRLDGSVand GVYYQGGTYSKAS are largely exposed on the surface, as shown in the Protein Data Bank file 3FIB (34.Pratt K.P. Cote H.C. Chung D.W. Stenkamp R.E. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7176-7181Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) in RasMol (35.Sayle R.A. Milner-White E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 374Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2312) Google Scholar), where the underlined residues show exposure on the surface. These results suggest that both sequences are part of the αvβ3 binding sites in the fibrinogen γC domain. This patch of the protein surface spans a distance of 39 Å from Tyr-191 to Lys-356. In addition to the residues in these peptides, there other residues exposed on the surface and adjacent to these peptides that may play a role in binding αvβ3. These results suggest that both sequences are part of αvβ3 binding sites in fibrinogen γC domain. γC190–202 and γC346–358 also inhibited interaction between αvβ3and αEC, which is highly homologous to γC (2.Yee V.C. Pratt K.P. Cote H.C. Trong I.L. Chung D.W. Davie E.W. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Structure (Lond.). 1997; 5: 125-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), suggesting that γC and αEC binding sites in αvβ3 are overlapping. None of the γC-derived peptides we used in this study blocked αIIbβ3-fibrinogen interaction (Fig. 5). This is consistent with the observation that αIIbβ3 binds to γC in a manner distinct from that of αvβ3. αIIbβ3 specifically binds to fibrinogen γ chain dodecapeptide sequence (residues 400–411) (Ref. 5.Farrell D.H. Thiagarajan P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 226-231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and references therein), but αvβ3 does not require the sequence for binding to γC. Another possibility is that αIIbβ3 also recognizes γC190–202 and/or γC346–358 sequences, but αIIbβ3-γC interaction is heavily dependent on the dodecapeptide sequence, so that neither γC190–202 nor γC346–358 sequence inhibits αIIbβ3-γC interaction. It is also possible that these two integrins bind to distinctly different surfaces of the fibrinogen γ chain: αIIbβ3 to the dodecapeptide and αvβ3 to the interface identified by the two peptides. γC190–202 (P1) peptide and another peptide, γC383–395 (P2-C), have been reported to inhibit αMβ2 binding to fibrinogen (7.Altieri D.C. Plescia J. Plow E.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1847-1853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Ugarova T.P. Solovjov D.A. Zhang L. Loukinov D.I. Yee V.C. Medved L.V. Plow E.F. J. Biol.

In our experiments, γC190–202 peptide inhibited αvβ3 binding to γC, but γC383–395 peptide did not, suggesting that αvβ3binding site(s) may overlap with, but is distinct from, αMβ2 binding sites in γC.

Endothelial or melanoma cells support αvβ3-mediated clot retraction, which is inhibited by anti-αvβ3 antibody (13.Smith R.A. Mosesson M.W. Rooney M.M. Lord S.T. Daniels A.U. Gartner T.K. J. Biol.

Blood. 1995; 86: 2606-2615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The αvβ3-mediated clot retraction is inhibited by RGD-containing peptides but does not require either RGD572–574 sequence in fibrinogen α chain or AGDV408–411 sequence in fibrinogen γ chain (13.Smith R.A.

In this study, we have shown that γC190–202 and γC346–358 inhibit αvβ3-mediated clot retraction. These results suggest that residues 190–202 and 346–358 of γC may be involved in αvβ3-mediated fibrin clot retraction. Since αvβ3 interacts with αEC (and possibly βC) in addition to γC (11.Yokoyama K. Zhang X.-P. Medved L. Takada Y. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5872-5877Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), it is possible that the sequences in αEC or βC that correspond to γC190–202 or γC346–358 may be also involved in αvβ3-mediated clot retraction. Furtherin vitro and in vivo studies will be required to establish the possible biological and pathological function of these regions in fibrinogen C-terminal domains. Tenascin C is detected at high levels during embryonic development in many organs and tissues in a changing spatiotemporal pattern (reviewed by Ref. 39.Erickson H.P. Bourdon M.A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 71-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Tenascin C levels are low in normal adult tissue (40.Oike Y. Hiraiwa H. Kawakatsu H. Nishikai M. Okinaka T. Suzuki T. Okada A. Yatani R. Sakakura T. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1990; 34: 309-317PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Natali P.G. Nicotra M.R. Bigotti A. Botti C. Castellani P. Risso A.M. Zardi L. Int. J. Cancer. 1991; 47: 811-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In contrast, tenascin C expression is up-regulated in many conditions associated with angiogenesis, such as wound healing (42.Mackie E.J. Halfter W. Liverani D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2757-2767Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar), arthritis (43.Cutolo M. Picasso M. Ponassi M. Sun M.Z. Balza E. J. Rheumatol. 1992; 19: 1439-1447PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Salter D.M. Br. J. Rheumatol. 1993; 32: 780-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and tumor formation (reviewed by Ref. 45.Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1993; 4: 301-310PubMed Google Scholar). In human gliomas tenascin C accumulation was found to correlate well with the degree of histological malignancy (46.Zagzag D. Friedlander D.R. Miller D.C. Dosik J. Cangiarella J. Kostianovsky M. Cohen H. Grumet M. Greco M.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 907-914PubMed Google Scholar) and with tumor neovascularization (47.Higuchi M. Ohnishi T. Arita N. Hiraga S. Hayakawa T. Acta Neuropathol. 1993; 85: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Tenascin C immunostaining was consistently stronger around and within walls of hyperplastic blood vessels than in nonhyperplastic vessels, suggesting that tenascin C might play a role in tumor angiogenesis. Tenascin C expression has also been shown to correlate with the degree of inflammation during atherosclerogenesis (48.Wallner K. Li C. Shah P.K. Fishbein M.C. Forrester J.S. Kaul S. Sharifi B.G. Circulation. 1999; 99: 1284-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar) and up-regulated in vein grafts in the arterial system (48.Wallner K. Li C. Shah P.K. Fishbein M.C. Forrester J.S. Kaul S. Sharifi B.G. Circulation. 1999; 99: 1284-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), indicating that tenascin C is involved in vascular remodeling. Joshi et al. (15.Joshi P. Chung C., I, A. Erickson H. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 389-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) find that endothelial cells adhered to TNfbg. Adhesion was inhibited by 0.1 mm RGD peptide and by EDTA, which suggested the involvement of an integrin (15.Joshi P. Chung C., I, A. Erickson H. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 389-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we have confirmed this interpretation and identified the integrin as αvβ3. A recent report suggest that TNfbg may be involved in anti-adhesive effect of tenascin C and may be involved in the initiation of angiogenesis (14.Schenk S. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Battegay E.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 2933-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). LaFleur et al. (33.LaFleur D.W. Chiang J. Fagin J.A. Schwartz S.M. Shah P.K. Wallner K. Forrester J.S. Sharifi B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32798-32803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) report that aortic smooth muscle cells interact with TNfbg and that a peptide derived from this domain, WYRNCHRVNLMGRYGDNNHSQGVNWFHWKG (peptide VIII), inhibits this interaction. They have shown that aortic smooth muscle cells adhere to the peptide VIII (33.LaFleur D.W. Chiang J. Fagin J.A. Schwartz S.M. Shah P.K. Wallner K. Forrester J.S. Sharifi B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32798-32803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) but did not show whether this interaction is mediated by integrins. Interestingly, the tenascin C-derived peptide VIII resides in a similar predicted location in the three-dimensional fold to the fibrinogen-derived γC346–358 peptide that is critical for γC/αvβ3 interaction, but in fact there is little or no similarity between them. In the present study, we have shown that tenascin C peptide VIII specifically binds to αvβ3, and this interaction is blocked by γC190–202 and γC346–358 peptides. These results suggest that the peptide VIII sequence is indeed involved in αvβ3/TNfbg interaction. Integrin αvβ3 has been implicated in tumor-induced angiogenesis (49.Eliceiri B.P. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1227-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar), but the αvβ3 ligands during angiogenesis have not been identified. αvβ3 has a limited tissue distribution in the adult human, and it is not typically expressed on epithelial cells and expressed at minimal levels on intestinal, vascular, and uterine smooth muscle cells. Some invasive tumors, such as metastatic melanoma and late-stage glioblastoma also express αvβ3 where it contributes to malignant phenotype of the tumor (26.Felding-Habermann B. Ruggeri Z.M. Cheresh D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5070-5077Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Endothelial cells exposed to growth factors or those undergoing angiogenesis in tumors, wounds, or inflammatory tissue express high levels of αvβ3 (Ref. 49.Eliceiri B.P. Cheresh D.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1227-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar and references therein). It appears that expression of tenascin C and αvβ3 are similarly regulated in many occasions. The present results provide evidence that αvβ3 may specifically bind to TNfbg in several occasions in vivo, including wound healing and tumor formation. Fibrin deposition is a consistent early event in solid tumors and healing wounds and precedes new blood vessel in-growth in both. The provisional clot matrices during wound healing and that abound throughout solid tumor masses are rich in fibrin (10.Clark R.A. Tonnesen M.G. Gailit J. Cheresh D.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1407-1421PubMed Google Scholar, 50.Dvorak H.F. N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 315: 1650-1659Crossref PubMed Scopus (3506) Google Scholar). Fibrin gels of themselves induce an angiogenic response (51.Dvorak H.F. Harvey V.S. Estrella P. Brown L.F. McDonagh J. Dvorak A.M. Lab. Invest. 1987; 57: 673-686PubMed Google Scholar). The present results show that fibrinogen γC domain and TNfbg may interact with αvβ3 in a similar fashion. Thus it is also possible that interaction between αvβ3and fibrinogen C-terminal domains may have a similar role in wound healing and tumor formation."

Unusually, the proteins appear to be bifunctional; their amino-terminal regions have strong similarity with P-type ATPases, and the sequence and structure of the carboxyl-terminal regions conform to that of G protein-dependent adenylyl cyclases, with two sets of six transmembrane sequences, each followed by a catalytic domain (C1 and C2). However, amino acids that are enzymatically important and present in the C2 domain of mammalian adenylyl cyclases are located in the C1 domain of the P. falciparum proteins and vice versa. In addition, certain key residues in these domains are more characteristic of guanylyl cyclases. Consistent with this, guanylyl cyclase activity was obtained following expression of the catalytic domains of PfGCβ inEscherichia coli. In P. falciparum, expression of both genes was detectable in the sexual but not the asexual blood stages of the life cycle, and PfGCα was localized to the parasite/parasitophorous vacuole membrane region of gametocytes. The profound structural differences identified between mammalian and parasite guanylyl cyclases suggest that aspects of this signaling pathway may be mechanistically distinct.

Mosquito transmitted sporozoites migrate to the liver where they undergo asexual multiplication within hepatocytes. Liver forms are then released into the bloodstream where they invade red blood cells. A small proportion of the erythrocytic forms develop into gametocytes, precursors of male and female gametes. When gametocytes are taken up by a mosquito during a bloodmeal, they must first emerge from the red blood cells as gametes before fertilization occurs in the midgut, prior to completion of the insect stages of the parasite life cycle. The emergence of eight motile male gametes from a red blood cell is known as exflagellation. Recent work (1.Bilker O. Lindo V. Panico M. Etienne A.E. Paxton T. Dell A. Rodgers M. Sinden R.E. Morris H.R. Nature. 1998; 392: 289-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) has identified xanthurenic acid, a metabolite of tryptophan, as a putative in vivo gametocyte-activating factor. In bothP. falciparum and Plasmodium berghei there is evidence that cyclic GMP may be involved in the development and emergence of male gametes (2.Kawamoto F. Alejo-Blanco R. Fleck S.L. Kawamoto Y. Sinden R.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 42: 101-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The parasite signaling pathways involved in these processes remain to be elucidated. Two key components of signal transduction pathways are adenylyl cyclase (AC)1 and guanylyl cyclase (GC), enzymes that catalyze the conversion of ATP and GTP to cAMP and cGMP, respectively. Membrane-associated mammalian ACs are activated indirectly following interaction of a ligand with a separate receptor. This in turn binds to an intracellular heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein (G protein). Subunits of the activated G protein then interact with AC stimulating the synthesis of cAMP, which activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). PKA phosphorylates a number of proteins; its final destination is often the nucleus where it activates transcription factors, thereby changing the pattern of gene expression. In mammals, nine distinct membrane-localized ACs have so far been characterized (3.Sunahara R.K. Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 461-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). They conform to the same basic structure comprising two sets of six hydrophobic transmembrane domains, each of which is followed by a cytoplasmic catalytic region termed C1 and C2, respectively. The amino-terminal portions (C1a and C2a) are homologous with each other and between species (4.Krupinsky J. Coussen F. Bakalyar H.A. Tang W.-J. Feinstein P.G. Orth K. Slaughter C. Reed R.R. Gilman A.G. Science. 1989; 244: 1558-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Guanylyl cyclase exists in two main forms. The receptor form (with a single membrane-spanning domain) binds directly to an extracellular ligand leading to activation and production of intracellular cGMP. The soluble, cytosolic form of the enzyme is activated by nitric oxide in the presence of heme (reviewed in Ref. 5.Chinkers M. Garbers D.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 553-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). GCs have a variety of roles in higher organisms, for example in photoreceptor signal transduction (reviewed in Ref. 6.Garbers D.L. Lowe D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30741-30744Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). GCs have also been identified in several lower organisms including protozoans such as Dictyostelium (7.Janssens P.M. de Jong C.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 150: 405-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar),Paramecium, and Tetrahymena (8.Schultz J.E. Klumpp S. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 195: 466-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 9.Linder J.U. Engel P. Reimer A. Krüger T. Plattner H. Schultz A. Schultz J.E. EMBO. 1999; 18: 4222-4232Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In sea urchins, a membrane-bound GC found on the surface of sperm can act as a receptor for peptides released by the eggs, which influence sperm chemotaxis (reviewed in Ref. 10.Ward G.E. Moy G.W. Vacquier V.D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1986; 207: 359-382PubMed Google Scholar). cGMP often exerts its function by binding to and activating cGMP-dependent protein kinase, which phosphorylates and regulates the activity of a number of specific proteins. As part of an investigation of the role of cyclic nucleotides in signal transduction in the malaria parasite, we have isolated two genes fromP. falciparum that encode integral membrane proteins. These proteins are unusual in that they appear to be bifunctional. The amino-terminal regions have strong similarity to P-type ATPases, and the carboxyl-terminal regions, including domains with GC activity, conform to a structure normally associated with G protein-dependent ACs.

Med. Hyg. 1984; 78: 242-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) were cultured in flasks with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 25 mm Hepes, 0.1 mmhypoxanthine, 10% human serum (A+) as described previously (13.Harte P.G. Rogers N.C. Targett G.A.T. Immunology. 1985; 56: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures contained A+ human red blood cells at a 10% hematocrit. Large scale parasite preparations of clone 3D7A were produced using a semi-automated continuous flow apparatus. Gametocytes (stages III–V) were harvested and purified by Percoll gradient centrifugation (13.Harte P.G. Rogers N.C. Targett G.A.T. Immunology. 1985; 56: 1-7PubMed Google Scholar). Genomic DNA was isolated from 109 mixed asexual erythrocytic stage parasites according to standard procedures (14.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Briefly, the parasites were first released from red blood cells by treatment with 0.1% saponin in phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in a solution containing 100 μg ml−1 proteinase K, 0.5% SDS, 100 mmNaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 25 mm EDTA at 37 °C for 16 h. DNA was further purified by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. Total RNA was isolated from 5 × 108 gametocytes (mainly stages III–V) or mixed asexual erythrocytic stage parasites by lysis with 4 m guanidine thiocyanate and CsCl centrifugation (15.Robson K.J.H. Jennings M.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 46: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). A 220-bp fragment of the PfGCα gene was isolated from genomic DNA (strain K1) by PCR using the degenerate primers DC1 (sense) and MS2 (antisense), which were derived from conserved regions of AC/GC genes from diverse species. The reactions (50 μl) were carried out in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.8, 50 mm KCl, 0.5–5 mm MgCl2, and 1% Triton X-100 with 1 μm of each primer, 200 μm dNTP mix, 1 unit of Biotaq enzyme (Bioline) and 1–50 ng of template DNA. To minimize nonspecific amplification products, the “touchdown” method (16.Don R.H. Cox P.T. Wainwright B.J. Baker K. Mattick J.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4008Crossref PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar) of thermal cycling was used with the following conditions: first cycle, 94 °C (2.5 min), 41 °C (1 min), and 72 °C (1 min); and second cycle, 94 °C (45 s), 40 °C (1 min), and 72 °C (1 min). The annealing temperature was then decreased by 1 °C each two cycles until it reached 35 °C. 25 cycles were performed under these conditions. A final cycle was then carried out at 94 °C (45 s), 35 °C (1 min), and 72 °C (10 min). Inverse PCR (17.Triglia T. Peterson M.G. Kemp D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 8186Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar) was used to extend the available PfGCα sequence after library screening (below) failed to isolate the full-length gene. Based on Southern blot data, an AluI digest of genomic DNA (1 μg, strain K1) was circularized with T4 DNA ligase, and an overlapping fragment was obtained by inverse PCR using primers IPCR1 and IPCR2. A λGEM-12 library was constructed with P. falciparum (strain K1) genomic DNA using a Promega kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, a Sau3a partial digest of genomic DNA was end-filled and ligated with blunt-ended XhoI cut λGEM-12 arms. After ligation, the DNA was packaged in vitro using a Packagene Extract (Promega) and plated on Escherichia colistrain LE392. The library (containing 2.7 × 105clones) was screened with the original 220-bp PCR product using standard procedures (14.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), and a genomic clone (λ1) containing part of the PfGCα gene was isolated. Vectorette libraries were constructed as described previously (18.Li J.-L. Robson K.J.H. Targett G.A.T. Baker D.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 805-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) using 1 μg of genomic DNA (clone 3D7A) that had been digested with one of several restriction enzymes. This DNA (200 ng) was ligated into blunt-ended Vectorette DNA (Cambridge Research Biochemicals). Based on known sequence and Southern blot information, PCR was performed using specific primers (AC1–AC9 forPfGCα, pvec1–3 for PfGCβ) and the Vectorette I primer (Cambridge Research Biochemicals). With this procedure we were able to obtain the remainder of the PfGCα coding sequence and the cyclase-encoding domain of PfGCβ. In the PCR reactions, the polymerase was added to the tubes in the cycling block when the reaction temperature was at least 80 °C. This “hot start” and the use of annealing temperatures in the range 60–70 °C were important for the success of the reaction. The following oligonucleotides were used: DC1, 5′-GTATATAAAGTAGAAAC(A/T)AT(T/A)GG; MS2, 5′-(T/A)CC(A/G)AA(T/G)AA(A/G)CA(A/G)TA(T/A)C(T/G)(T/A)GGCAT; IPCR1, 5′-TTATGATCATCAATAAATAC; IPCR2, 5′-TTATTATTCATATCAGC; AC1, 5′-TGTATCACCATCGATTGTATTAAATG; AC2, 5′-CATAATAATTACTTGTATCACCATCG; AC3, 5′-ACGAGTAGGTTCAATACTGGCCAC; AC4, 5′-GGAAATAAAACTGCTTGAAATACTCC; AC5, 5′-GAATATGCTTCTGTTTAAATTCCTTTTTG; AC6, 5′-TTTTGAATATGCTTCTGTTTAAATTCC; AC7, 5′-GGCATTACTATTTTCTAAGGCAGC; AC8, 5′-ATGAGCAAGCATCATCATACATTC; AC9, 5′-TCTTCTTTGTCTTCATATGCATAGG; 5CAT, 5′-CGCGCGAATTCTCTACCTATTGTAAAGAATCA; 3CAT, 5′-CGCGCGAATTCCAAATTCGACTGGCGATCGTT; pvec1, 5′-ATCAATTCGTTTACTATATCTACTATC; pvec2, 5′-TTAACAGATCCAATCACACCACTG; and pvec3, 5′-ACGTGTGGTTGTAATGTAGATACC (degenerate positions are marked with slashes). To isolate chromosome-sized DNA, asexual blood stage parasites were first released from red blood cells by saponin lysis and then washed in TSE buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm EDTA). The pellet was resuspended in 9 volumes of TSE and then mixed with an equal volume of 1.6% agarose in TSE and pipetted into a gel mold (Bio-Rad). The agarose blocks (108-109 parasites/block) were incubated in 1% sarcosinate, 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8.0, 2 mg ml−1 proteinase K for 48 h at 50 °C and then stored at 4 °C. Chromosome separations were performed with 1% agarose gels using a contour-clamped homogeneous field electrophoresis system (CHEF DRII, Bio-Rad). The gels were run in 0.5% TBE buffer at 100 V for 96 h with a pulse time of 360 s ramped to 800 s. Typically, hybridizations were performed at 42 °C in 6× SSC and 50% formamide with washes in 1× SSC at 50 °C. For lower stringency experiments, hybridizations were at 50 °C in 5× SSC with washes in 2× SSC at room temperature. Northern blots were carried out using standard conditions (15.Robson K.J.H. Jennings M.W. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1991; 46: 19-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers 5CAT and 3CAT were designed to amplify the carboxyl-terminal region of PfGCα, Ser3914–Leu4226), incorporating the C2 catalytic domain. EcoRI restriction sites were included in the primers to facilitate insertion of the fragment in-frame with theSchistosoma japonicum glutathione S-transferase gene of the pGEX1λT plasmid (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Expression of the fusion protein was induced in a 500-ml mid-log phase E. coli (strain JM109) culture (A 600 = 0.4–0.5) by the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 1 mm for 2 h. Cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline /1% Triton X-100 and sonicated on ice. The soluble fusion protein was bound to 2 ml of glutathione-agarose (Sigma) on a Poly-Prep column (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bound protein was eluted by addition of 5 mm reduced glutathione and dissolved in 0.5 ml of normal saline at a final concentration of 2 mg ml−1. This was mixed with 0.5 ml of Ribi Adjuvant System (Sigma) resuspended in 1 ml of normal saline. The mixture was homogenized by vortexing, and a New Zealand White rabbit was immunized at six intradermal sites (50 μg each), two intramuscular sites (200 μg each), and two subcutaneous sites (100 μg each). Similar booster injections were given at 3–4-week intervals. Preimmune serum was taken prior to immunization. Percoll-purified gametocytes that had been stimulated to undergo gametogenesis were fixed for 30 min with 2% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, dehydrated in ethanol, embedded in LR White (London Resin Co.), and polymerized at 50 °C for 48 h. Ultrathin sections were collected on piloform-coated nickel grids and incubated with primary antibody and gold-conjugated secondary antibody as described previously (19.Baker D.A. Daramola O.O. McCrossan M.V. Harmer J. Targett G.A.T. Parasitology. 1994; 108: 129-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The sections were silver enhanced using an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech IntenSE M silver enhancement kit and then stained with a saturated uranyl acetate solution in 30% methanol followed by Reynolds lead citrate solution. The samples were analyzed with a JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope at 80 kV and photographed using Agfa Scienta EM film. DNA sequencing was performed using an ABI PRISM 377 DNA sequencer. The reactions were performed with a dye terminator cycle sequencing Ready Reaction Kit (Perkin-Elmer). Preliminary sequence data for P. falciparum chromosome 11 were obtained from the Institute for Genomic Research website. Sequencing of chromosome 11 was part of the International Malaria Genome Sequencing Project and was supported by an award from the NIAID, National Institutes of Health. Sequence data for P. falciparum chromosome 13 were obtained from the Sanger Center website. Sequencing of P. falciparum chromosome 13 was accomplished as part of the Malaria Genome Project with support by the Wellcome Trust. The cyclase catalytic domains of both PfGCα (C1, Gly2998–Val3329, and C2, Gln3956–Lys4163) and PfGCβ (C1, Val1533–Tyr1758, and C2, Glu2946–Ala3122) and the catalytic domain of aTrypanosoma cruzi AC (ADC-1, Arg849–Lys1169) were cloned into pTrcHis C (Invitrogen) to give hexahistidine amino-terminal fusion proteins. Expression of the fusion proteins in E. coli (strain TP610, AC-deficient) was induced at 30 °C by incubation with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 1 h. Cultures were then lysed by sonication (six 10-s bursts at an amplitude of 20 μm using an MSE Soniprep 150) in a solution containing 50 mm NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 50 μg ml−11-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone, and 1 mg ml−1lysozyme). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. Proteins were affinity purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid Sepharose according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). AC and GC activity was assayed in reaction volumes of 40 μl. 30-μl aliquots of fusion protein (2–5 μg) were added to 10 μl of 4× reaction buffer (40 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing either ATP or GTP at 4 mm and 8 mm MgCl2 or MnCl2) and incubated at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by addition of 10 μl of 0.2 m EDTA, pH 8.0, followed by boiling for 2 min. For the t = 0 time points, EDTA was added before the protein. cAMP or cGMP concentrations were measured in 96-well plates using a competition assay (20.Gilman A.G. Adv. Cyclic Nucleotide Res. 1972; 2: 9-24PubMed Google Scholar) with purified regulatory subunit of beef heart cAMP-dependent protein kinase as the cAMP-binding protein (PKA-R) or highly specific anti-cGMP antibodies as the cGMP binding protein (21.Schulkes C.C.G.M. Schoen C.D. Arents J.C. Van Driel R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, samples were mixed with 20 μl of 0.4 mCi of [3H]cAMP (48 Ci mmol−1; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or [3H]cGMP (14.8 Ci mmol−1) per ml of assay buffer (4 mm EDTA in 150 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5) and 20 μl of PKA-R or cGMP antibody preparation. After incubation on ice for 90 min, 40 μl of activated charcoal (1.25 g of charcoal and 0.5 g of bovine serum albumin in 25 ml of assay buffer) was added to adsorb unbound [3H]cAMP or [3H]cGMP. Samples were centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. 50 μl of supernatant was mixed with 100 μl of scintillation fluid, and the radioactivity was measured (22.van Es S. Virdy K.J. Pitt G.S.

A standard curve was produced with a linear range from 0–16 pmol cAMP/cGMP. Degenerate oligonucleotide primers were designed based on conserved regions in the catalytic domains of AC/GC from other species (see “Experimental Procedures”). Using these, a 220-bp fragment was amplified by PCR from P. falciparum genomic DNA. Data base searches suggested that the product was derived from a purine nucleotide cyclase gene homologue. This fragment was used to screen a genomic DNA library, and a clone was isolated. Sequence analysis of a 5.5-kilobaseBamHI-EcoRV fragment identified a 1.8-kilobase open reading frame (ORF) corresponding to the 3′-end of a cyclase-like gene, with a putative stop codon and adjacent 3′ noncoding sequence. Inverse and Vectorette PCR techniques (see “Experimental Procedures”) were used to extend the sequence toward the 5′-end of the gene. This generated an uninterrupted ORF of approximately 10 kilobases. A putative start codon was then identified following searches of the Institute for Genomic Research P. falciparumdata base. Verification of the gene structure was obtained by sequencing the corresponding region (Fig.1), amplified from genomic DNA. In addition the entire sequence of PfGCα has been confirmed following release of data from the Institute for Genomic Research data base, which became available during the preparation of this manuscript. The nucleotide sequence of PfGCα comprises a single ORF of 12,678 bp (these sequence data have been submitted to the GenBankTM data base under accession number AJ245435). The A/T content (75.6%) and codon usage conform to that of all P. falciparum genes reported to date. The designated termination codon (TAA) of PfGCα occurs in a position analogous to that in mammalian-type AC (4.Krupinsky J. Coussen F. Bakalyar H.A. Tang W.-J. Feinstein P.G. Orth K. Slaughter C.

Nature. 1997; 386: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) and is followed immediately by an extremely A/T-rich region (95%). Within the ORF, two regions of unusually high A/T content were identified (nucleotides 7350–7530 and nucleotides 9060–9450). To investigate the possibility of introns at these positions and elsewhere in the gene, a series of RT/PCR reactions were carried out. There were no differences in the sizes of the products obtained from RNA (DNase I-treated) and genomic DNA (data not shown). In negative controls where the reaction was performed in the absence of RT, no products were amplified. Using this approach it was shown that PfGCα was uninterrupted by introns. Analysis of the PfGCα sequence revealed an unexpected finding; the gene had the potential to encode a bifunctional protein in which the amino-terminal domain had high similarity to P-type ATPases (26.Ripmaster T.L. Vaughn G.P. Woodford Jr., J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7901-7912Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and the carboxyl terminus was a structural homologue of G protein-dependent adenylyl cyclases. The nucleotide sequence adjacent to the putative start codon is aaaaATG, which is similar to the consensus sequence upstream of many P. falciparum genes (27.Saul A. Battistutta D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 42: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The sequence immediately upstream of this is preceded by a highly A/T-rich sequence interrupted by stop codons in all three reading frames. A P. falciparum λGEM-12 library was screened at low stringency with a probe corresponding to the PfGCαC2 catalytic domain (see “Experimental Procedures”). A clone containing 1.3 kilobase of sequence with similarity to PfGCα and encompassing an in-frame stop codon was isolated. This gene was designated PfGCβ. The remainder of the cyclase encoding region (an additional 2000 nucleotides) was obtained from Vectorette libraries (see “Experimental Procedures”). Upstream, an additional open reading frame with a high degree of similarity to P-type ATPases was discovered. The sequence of this region was obtained from the P. falciparum genome project (Sanger Center). The cyclase and the ATPase coding regions were found to be separated by 241 bp of A/T-rich sequence. This was shown to be an intron, and both coding regions were found to form a contiguous ORF. Sequence analysis of a series of RT/PCR products obtained using primers specific to both the cyclase and ATPase domains demonstrated the presence of 12 introns in thePfGCβ sequence. These were all confined to the ATPase encoding domain (Fig. 1). The fully spliced transcript has the potential to encode a bifunctional protein of 3122 amino acids (accession number AJ249165). The 5′-most exon contains an A/T-rich sequence upstream of the designated start codon that has stop codons in all three reading frames. Sequencing of RT/PCR products has confirmed that this A/T-rich sequence forms part of the mature mRNA. The predicted stop codon (position 9367) is located upstream of a region with an extremely A/T-rich composition that has stop codons in all three reading frames. The positions of the designated start and stop codons are consistent with those found in other genes encoding similar P-type ATPases and cyclases, respectively. The sequence of the cyclase-encoding region has been confirmed by chromosome 13 sequence data that were released (Sanger Center) during preparation of this manuscript. Using the Genestream Align global alignment program the sequences of PfGCα and PfGCβ were found to share 22% identity in their cyclase domains and 19% in their ATPase domains. The relatedness of both PfGCα and PfGCβ to GC/AC is concentrated in two regions (PfGCαC1 Gly2999–Val3329; PfCαC2, Gln3956–Lys4163; PfGCβC1, Val1533–Tyr1758; and PfGCβC2, Glu2946–Ala3122), which have 26–33% sequence identity and 48–52% similarity (28.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70715) Google Scholar) to the corresponding regions of enzymes from diverse species. These hydrophilic regions correspond to the positions of the catalytic domains. PfGCαC1 is characterized by the presence of a long asparagine-rich stretch (amino acids Asn3082–Asn3138; Fig.2). Interestingly, the aggregation-specific adenylyl cyclase (ACA) of the protozoanDictyostelium discoideum has a similar sequence insertion at the same position within the C1 catalytic domain (29.Pitt G.S. Milona N. Borleis J. Lin K.C. Reed R.R. Devreotes P.N. Cell. 1992; 69: 305-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). There is a second, shorter insertion in PfGCαC1(Tyr3186–Thr3225; Fig. 2) that corresponds (in terms of both position and size) to an insert found in all of the trypanosomatid ACs sequenced to date. No such inserts are present in the cyclase catalytic domains of PfGCβ. Alignment of PfGCαC1 with PfGCαC2 revealed 23% sequence identity, whereas alignment of PfGCβC1 and PfGCβC2 gave 34% identity. The cyclase catalytic domains of both PfGCα and PfGCβ are each preceded by highly hydrophobic regions that in membrane-associated mammalian ACs have been predicted to form two sets of six transmembrane domains. The PfGCα and PfGCβ sequences are also compatible with this type of organization (Fig. 3). The putative ATPase domains of both proteins conform to the P-type (or E1-E2) family of cation transporting ATPases (30.Jencks W.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1992; 671: 49-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The model for this family of enzymes predicts 10 transmembrane domains arranged as a set of four toward the amino terminus and a set of six near the carboxyl terminus. The amino acid sequences of both PfGCα and PfGCβ are consistent with this type of structure (Fig. 3). For both PfGCα and PfGCβ the relatedness to P-type ATPases from diverse species is concentrated in two regions and is summarized below. The amino-terminal domain of PfGCα has 26–32% identity and 48–52% similarity over 250–300 amino acids; for the carboxyl terminus the figures are 28–30% identity and 48–50% similarity. For PfGCβ, the amino-terminal domain has 23–25% identity and 43–46% similarity; for the carboxyl terminus the figures are 21–23% identity and 46–48% similarity. The membrane-spanning regions of the P-type ATPase domains are more highly conserved than are those of the cyclase domains. This might be expected given the potential functional significance of these transmembrane regions. The consensus phosphorylation site of P-type ATPases (DKTGTLT) is present in PfGCα (Asp756–Thr762) but not in PfGCβ. This signature sequence is involved in formation of an aspartyl phosphate intermediate during ATP hydrolysis (31.MacLennan D.H. Brandl C.J. Korczak B. Green N.M.

Sancar A. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1996; 88: 1346-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). The first platinum compound introduced in the clinic iscis-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (cisplatin).1Later, two new platinum complexes,cis-diammine-1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxylatoplatinum(II) (carboplatin) and (trans-R, R)1,2-diamminocyclohexaneoxalatoplatinum(II) (oxaliplatin), were also introduced in the clinic, but they do not display a vastly different spectrum of antitumor activity (2.Lokich J.

The intrinsic along with acquired resistance and side effects observed in some patients represent major limitations of the treatment of human tumors with the platinum drugs currently used in the clinic. The need for improved clinical protocols has prompted a search for new platinum chemotherapeutic agents as well as a more complete understanding of the cellular mechanisms underlying both antitumor efficacy and resistance. Platinum anticancer drugs exert their cytotoxic effect by inducing DNA damage with adducts formed being various types of cross-links (4.Johnson N.P. Butour J.-L. Villani G. Wimmer F.L. Defais M. Pierson V. Brabec V. Prog. Clin. Biochem. Med. 1989; 10: 1-24Crossref Google Scholar, 5.Lepre C.A. Lippard S.J. Nucleic Acids Mol.

Since the discovery of the antitumor efficiency of cisplatin in 1969, the only new platinum antitumor drugs introduced in the clinic are direct structural analogues of cisplatin (cis-diammine-1,1-cyclobutanedicarboxylatoplatinum(II) differs from cisplatin only in the more inert leaving group similar to (trans-R, R)1,2-diamminocyclohexaneoxalatoplatinum(II), which still contains as a carrier ligand 1,2-diaminocyclohexane). These new compounds produce an array of adducts very similar to those of cisplatin (7.Blommaert F.A. van Dijk-Knijnenburg H.C.M. Dijt F.J. Denengelse L. Baan R.A. Berends F.

Oncol. 1998; 9: 1053-1071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar). In a search for novel classes of platinum antitumor compounds a hypothesis that platinum drugs that bind to DNA in a fundamentally different manner to that of cisplatin will have altered pharmacological properties has been tested. This concept has already led to the synthesis of several new platinum antitumor compounds. One class of these novel compounds comprises bifunctional dinuclear and trinuclear platinum compounds that exhibit a different spectrum of cytostatic activity including activity in tumor cells resistant to cisplatin (10.Farrell N. Qu Y. Bierbach U. Valsecchi M. Menta E. Lippert B. 30 Years of Cisplatin: Chemistry and Biochemistry of a Leading Anticancer Drug. Verlag Helvetica Chimica Acta, Wiley-VCH, Zurich1999: 479-496Google Scholar). It is therefore of great interest to understand details of molecular mechanisms underlying the biological efficacy of these new compounds, in particular how these compounds affect double-helical DNA. Several recent papers have demonstrated unique DNA binding modes of these bifunctional polynuclear platinum compounds (11.Farrell N. Appleton T.G. Qu Y. Roberts J.D. Fontes A.P.S. Skov K.A. Wu P.

In these formally bifunctional DNA binding dinuclear platinum agents, two monofunctional platinum(II) spheres with the single chloride leaving group on each platinum are linked by a variable length diamine chain so that the leaving chloride ligands are trans to the linker. Interestingly, varying the length of the linker may affect the distance and spatial configuration of the reactive chloride groups in these dinuclear compounds, hence also their DNA binding mode and consequently biological effect. Importantly, the observation that these dinuclear compounds preferentially form in DNA interstrand cross-links is also in marked contrast to cisplatin, which forms as major DNA adduct intrastrand cross-links between neighboring purine residues, and the interstrand cross-links only represent minor DNA lesions (∼6%; Refs. 17.Brabec V. Leng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar and 18.Vrana O. Boudny V. Brabec V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3918-3925Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In the present work we continue to investigate DNA interactions of trans-bisPt complexes in cell-free medium to address further fundamental questions about the mechanism of antitumor activity of this novel class of platinum drugs. In a previous report (19.Zou Y. Van Houten B. Farrell N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5404-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), using an indirect assay employing exonuclease digestion of the DNA fragment globally modified only by one trans-bisPt complex (having n = 4), some sites in DNA involved in the interstrand cross-links have been already suggested. However, no systematic study on sequence specificity of these lesions including the effect of the length of the diamine linker has been performed. Therefore, first, we examined in detail which sites are preferentially involved in the major adducts of these dinuclear platinum compounds with particular attention paid to the effect of the length of their diamine linker. In addition, we also studied how major adducts oftrans-bisPt compounds affect local conformation of DNA in particular bending and unwinding. Some structures altered by platinum adducts, such as bending and unwinding attract various damaged DNA binding proteins (for instance those containing high mobility group (HMG) domain; Refs. 20.Zlatanova J. Yaneva J. Leuba S.H. FASEB. 1998; 12: 791-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 21.Ohndorf U.M. Rould M.A. He Q. Pabo C.O. Lippard S.J.

This binding of these proteins has been postulated to mediate the antitumor properties of the platinum drugs (23.Zamble D.B. Lippard S.J. Lippert B. Cisplatin: Chemistry and Biochemistry of a Leading Anticancer Drug. VHCA, WILEY-VCH, Zürich1999: 73-110Google Scholar). Therefore, in addition to examining the structural alterations induced in DNA by the adducts oftrans-bisPt compounds we also investigated in the present work how these adducts are recognized by HMG1 protein. trans-bisPt(2),trans-bisPt(4), and trans-bisPt(6) (see Fig.1 A) were prepared as described previously (24.Farrell N. Qu Y. Feng L. Van Houten B. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 9522-9531Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The monoaqua species were generated from trans-bisPt complexes (0.5 mm) by the addition of 0.95 molecular equivalent of AgNO3 in 10 mm NaClO4 at 37 °C for 24 h in the dark. The AgCl precipitate was removed by centrifugation. The synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides (see Fig.1 B) were synthesized and purified as described previously (25.Brabec V. Reedijk J. Leng M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12397-12402Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). HMG1 protein was a generous gift of Dr. M. Stros from the Institute of Biophysics (Brno, Czech Republic); it was isolated from calf thymus under nondenaturing conditions and purified and stored as described previously (26.Stros M. Vorlickova M. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1990; 12: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 27.Stros M. Reich J. Kolibalova A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 344: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). T4 DNA ligase and T4 polynucleotide kinase were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Acrylamide, bis(acrylamide), urea, and NaCN were from Merck KgaA (Darmstadt, Germany). Dimethyl sulfate (DMS), KMnO4, diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC), KBr, and KHSO5 were from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The single-stranded oligonucleotides (the top strands of the duplexes in Fig. 1 Bexcept d(TGGT)/d(ACCA)) were reacted in stoichiometric amounts with monoaqua derivatives of trans-bisPt complexes. The platinated oligonucleotides were repurified by ion exchange fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC). It was verified by platinum flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry and by the measurements of the optical density that the modified oligonucleotides contained two platinum atoms. It was also verified using DMS footprinting of platinum on DNA (17.Brabec V. Leng M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 28.Comess K.M.

A. 1991; 88: 1982-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar) that in the platinated top strands of all duplexes the N-7 position of single guanine residue was not accessible for reaction with DMS. Briefly, platinated and nonmodified top strands (5′-end-labeled with 32P) were reacted with DMS. DMS methylates the N-7 position of G residues in DNA, producing alkali labile sites (30.Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9013) Google Scholar). However, if N-7 is coordinated to platinum, it cannot be methylated. The oligonucleotides were then treated with hot piperidine and analyzed by denaturing 24% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. For the nonmodified oligonucleotides, shortened fragments caused by the cleavage of the strand at one methylated G were observed in the gel. However, no such bands were detected for the oligonucleotides modified by trans-bisPt complexes. These results indicate that one trans-bisPt molecule was coordinated to single G in the top strands of all duplexes. The platinated top strands were allowed to anneal with nonplatinated complementary strands (the bottom strands in Fig.1 B) in 0.1 m NaClO4. The resulting products were analyzed by FPLC in an alkaline gradient. Using this denaturing gradient, noninterstrand cross-linked strands were eluted as a 20–23-nucleotide single strand, whereas the interstrand cross-linked strands were eluted later in a single peak as a higher molecular mass species. This single peak was only collected so that the samples of the interstrand cross-linked duplexes contained no single-stranded molecules. Alternatively, the products were separated on 12% polyacrylamide/8 m urea denaturing gel, and the bands corresponding to interstrand cross-linked duplexes were analyzed by densitometry or were cut off from the gel, eluted, precipitated by ethanol, and dissolved in 50 mm NaCl. Both procedures of the purification of interstrand cross-linked duplexes provided the products whose subsequent analysis (see below) gave identical results. FPLC purification and flameless atomic absorption spectrophotometry measurements were carried out on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC System with MonoQ HR 5/5 column and a Unicam 939 AA spectrometer equipped with a graphite furnace, respectively. The duplexes d(TGGT)/d(ACCA) (Fig. 1 B) containing single, 1,2-d(GpG) intrastrand cross-link of trans-bisPt or cisplatin in the top strand were prepared as described (17.Brabec V. Leng M. Proc. Natl.

In the case of the platinated oligonucleotides, the platinum complex was removed after reaction of the DNA with the probe by incubation with 0.2 mNaCN (alkaline pH) at 45 °C for 10 h in the dark. Nonplatinated single strands (top strands in Fig. 1 B) and the duplexes containing a unique interstrand cross-link were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP by using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Then the single-stranded, nonplatinated oligonucleotides were annealed with their phosphorylated complementary strands. Nonplatinated or cross-link containing duplexes were allowed to react with T4 DNA ligase. The resulting samples along with ligated nonplatinated duplexes were subsequently examined on 8% native polyacrylamide (mono:bis(acrylamide) ratio = 29:1) electrophoresis gels. Other details of these experiments were as described in previously published papers (35.Koo H.S. Wu H.M. Crothers D.M. Nature. 1986; 320: 501-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (884) Google Scholar, 36.Bellon S.F. Lippard S.J. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 35: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Some ligation products were also used as the DNA probes in the studies of the recognition of DNA adducts oftrans-bisPt compounds by HMG1 proteins. For these experiments the double-stranded oligonucleotides 105 base pairs (bp) in length (containing five identical 21-bp oligonucleotide units d(TGTCT)/d(AGACA) (21.Ohndorf U.M. Rould M.A. He Q. Pabo C.O. Lippard S.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 708-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) shown in Fig. 1 B) were eluted from native polyacrylamide gels, precipitated by ethanol, and resuspended in 10 mm Tris-HCl/1 mm EDTA buffer, pH 7.4, to 5000 cpm/ml. For quantitation, the gel was stained with 0.5 mg of ethidium bromide/ml, and the amount of oligonucleotide duplex was determined in comparison with a known quantity of standard double-stranded oligonucleotide using a SepraScan 2001 image processing system for gel quantitation (ISS-Enprotech). The study of HMG1-DNA binding complexes was carried out as described (37.Bianchi M.E. Beltrame M. G. P. Science. 1989; 243: 1056-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar) with small modifications. 3 nm radiolabeled oligonucleotide probes 105 bp in length (concentration is related to the content of the 105-bp duplex), either nonmodified or containing the cross-link, were incubated for 15 min at 0 °C (ice bath) in the presence of 50 or 100 nm HMG1 protein and 0.2 mg of nonlabeled, sonicated calf thymus DNA/ml in the binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mmMgCl2, 20% glycerol, 0.2 mg of bovine serum albunim/ml, 10 mm HEPES-OH, pH 7.9, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) in a final volume of 10 μl. The protein-DNA complexes were then resolved on a 7% polyacrylamide gel (29:1 acrylamide/N,N′-methylene-bis(acrylamide)). The samples were electrophoresed at 4 °C using the electrophoresis buffer containing 0.045 m Tris borate and 1 mmEDTA, pH 8.0, and autoradiographed. We demonstrated in our preceding papers (14.Zaludova R. Zakovska A. Kasparkova J. Balcarova Z. Kleinwachter V. Vrana O. Farrell N. Brabec V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 508-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) that the preferential DNA binding sites of trans-bisPt compounds are G residues and that the major DNA adducts of these dinuclear platinum complexes are interstrand cross-links. In these cross-links the platinated sites are separated by one or more base pairs. Bifunctional dinuclear platinum complexes must bind to DNA first through one end of the dinuclear unit. In this first step of binding, the kinetic preferences are similar to those of mononuclear species, i.e. they coordinate preferentially to N-7 atoms of G residues. The array of adducts becomes, however, different upon the coordination of the second platinum unit (19.Zou Y. Van Houten B. Farrell N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5404-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Considering these facts we have designed a series of synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotide duplexes 1,2, 1,3, and 1,4, whose sequences are shown in Fig. 1B. The pyrimidine-rich top strands of these duplexes only contained one G in the center (bold type in Fig. 1 B). These top strands were modified by trans-bisPt complexes so that they contained a single monofunctional adduct of these platinum complexes at this central G site. The duplexes were also designed in such a way that their bottom (complementary) strands contained G in different positions symmetrically to the single central cytosine (complementary to the platinated G in the top strand). In this way, the G residue in the top strand with the monofunctionally attached trans-bisPt complex could close to 1,2, 1,3, or 1,4 GG interstrand cross-links in the duplex 1,2, 1,3, or 1,4, respectively. The 1,2 interstrand cross-link is formed between G sites in neighboring base pairs, whereas in 1,3 and 1,4 interstrand cross-links, the platinated G sites are separated by one or two base pairs, respectively. G sites in the bottom strands involved in these interstrand cross-links are also inbold type in Fig. 1 B. The nucleotide sequences of the duplexes were also designed in the way that these interstrand cross-links could close to G in the bottom strands located on both sides of the central C residue, i.e. in the 5′ → 5′ or 3′ → 3′ direction. The orientation of the interstrand cross-link in the 5′ → 5′ or 3′ → 3′ direction can be explained with the aid of the sequence of the duplex 1,3. For instance, the 1,3 GG interstrand cross-link oriented in the 5′ → 5′ direction is that formed in the duplex 1,3 between the central G in the top strand and G in position 10 in the bottom strand, whereas the same cross-link oriented in the 3′ → 3′ direction is that between the central G in the top strand and G in position 14 in the bottom strand. The monoadducted top strands of the duplexes 1,2, 1,3, and 1,4 were hybridized with their complementary strands, and the hybrids were incubated in 0.1 m NaClO4 at 37 °C. The aliquots were withdrawn at various time intervals and analyzed by gel electrophoresis under denaturing conditions. As shown in Fig.2 A for the duplex 1,2 modified by trans-bisPt(4), one band was only observed for the non-cross-linked duplex. The subsequent incubation resulted in new bands migrating markedly more slowly. Their intensity increased with the incubation time with a concomitant decrease in the intensity of the band corresponding to the non-cross-linked duplex. This observation can be interpreted to mean that interstrand cross-links were formed. From the ratio of the sum of intensities of all bands corresponding to cross-linked duplexes and the sum of intensities of all bands, the percentage of interstrand cross-links was calculated (Fig.2 B). The half-time of this interstrand cross-linking reaction in the duplex 1,3 was about 1 h. A similar result was obtained for the duplex 1,4, whereas the half-time found for the duplex 1,2 was markedly higher. The kinetics of the interstrand cross-linking reactions in all three duplexes were approximately the same and independent of the linker length of the trans-bisPt complex (n = 2, 4, or 6) (not shown). The cross-linking reactions in the duplexes 1,2, 1,3, and 1,4 resulted in only one band or single peak in the FPLC profile designated asinter in Fig. 2 A (shown for the duplex 1,2 andtrans-bisPt(4)). After a 24-h reaction period, the bands or FPLC peaks corresponding to the interstrand cross-linked duplexes were cut off from the gel or collected after FPLC separation, respectively, and the duplexes were isolated (eluted from the bands and precipitated or only precipitated from the FPLC fractions) and further characterized by Maxam-Gilbert footprinting (28.Comess K.M.

The samples of the 1,2, 1,3, and 1,4 interstrand duplexes cross-linked by either trans-bisPt(2, 4, 6) in which the upper strand was only 5′-end labeled with 32P were reacted with DMS, which does not react with platinated G because the N-7 position is no longer accessible (28.Comess K.M.

J. 1990; 267: 431-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and then the sample was treated with piperidine. In the nonplatinated duplexes, the central G in the top strands was reactive with DMS (not shown). It was no longer reactive in all three cross-linked duplexes. This observation confirms that the unique G in the upper strands remained platinated and was involved in the interstrand cross-link contained in the single fraction of interstrand cross-linked duplexes (28.Comess K.M. Costello C.E. Lippard S.J. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2102-2110Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 31.Brabec V. Sip M. Leng M.

A. 1994; 91: 8147-8151Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). In further studies the 1,2, 1,3, and 1,4 interstrand duplexes in which the bottom strand was 5′-end labeled with 32P were examined. Results of typical experiments, in which the locations of nucleotides involved in the interstrand cross-link oftrans-bisPt(4) formed in the duplexes 1,2, 1,3, or 1,4 were determined, are shown in Fig. 3. The interstrand cross-linked duplexes were reacted with DMS. Then these samples were further treated with NaCN to remove the adducts and finally also with piperidine. The treatment with piperidine of the control, nonplatinated duplex resulted in the cleavage at all G sites in the bottom strand (Fig. 3, no Pt lanes). If the cross-linked duplexes treated with DMS and subsequently NaCN were cleaved (Fig. 3, Pt/NaCN lanes), the bands corresponding to all G residues were observed except G residues marked by anarrow in Fig. 3. This result proves that these G residues were platinated and involved in the interstrand cross-link of thetrans-bisPt(4) compound. Identical results of these footprinting experiments were obtained if trans-bisPt(2) ortrans-bisPt(6) were used to cross-link the duplexes 1,2, 1,3, or 1,4. It implies that the interstrand adducts formed by thetrans-bisPt complexes were GG interstrand adducts formed at the G site in the bottom strand exclusively in the direction to its 5′ end (oriented in the 5′ → 5′ direction) and that the sites of interstrand cross-linking by trans-bisPt complexes were not substantially affected by the length of the linker chain. Because 1,2 interstrand cross-links represent only less frequent lesions formed in DNA bytrans-bisPt complexes, further studies of the present work were focused mainly on the major 1,3 interstrand cross-link. The oligonucleotide duplexes containing single 1,3 interstrand cross-link between G residues oriented in the 5′ → 5′ direction were further"

Walter U. Cell. 1994; 78 (295): 919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar for a review). In addition, NO is a modulator of neurotransmitter-mediated responses in the central nervous system (2.Haley J.E. Wilcox G.L. Chapman P.F. Neuron. 1992; 8: 211-216Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). In the adrenal gland, NO could be secreted from the chromaffin cell itself (3.Schwartz P.M. Rodrı́guez-Pascual F. Koesling D. Torres M. Fostermann U. Neuroscience. 1998; 82: 255-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), or paracrine, being secreted from contiguous endothelium (4.Torres M. Ceballos G. Rubio R. J. Neurochem. 1994; 63: 988-996Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In addition, NO could also be released by afferent nerves (5.Marley P.D. McLeod J. Anderson C. Thomson K.A. J.

To date, many in vitro studies have been carried out to elucidate the role of NO/cGMP on the secretory processes of chromaffin cells. Results are still controversial; O'Sullivan and Burgoyne (7.O'Sullivan A.J. Burgoyne R.D. J.

J. Pharmacol. 1998; 77: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). The present view is that the main role of NO is the control of adrenal blood flow, whereas its modulation on the bulk of CA release seems to be small (12.Moro M.A. Michelena P. Sánchez-Garcı́a P.

Here, we show conclusively that NO, acting on the guanylate cyclase cascade, produces dramatic changes on quantal release of CA by single chromaffin cells, probably acting on the intragranular matrix. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental report suggesting that the kinetic of vesicular release can be modulated by drugs or second messengers. In addition, we have found evidence indicating that the interaction of intragranular components can be modulated under physiological conditions. If this effect of NO were extended to dense core vesicles of sympathetic neurons, it would result in significant changes on synaptic efficacy, even releasing the same amount of noradrenaline quanta. Noradrenaline, SNP, IBMX, zaprinast, methylene blue, 8-Br-cGMP, cultured media, sera, and collagenase type IA were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Madrid, Spain). Fura-2/AM, Pluronic acid, and S-nitrosoglutathione were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Spermine-NO, l-NAME, and C-PTIO were purchased from RBI (Natick, MA). NO gas (N30) was purchased from Air Liquide (Tenerife, Spain). Urografin® was obtained from Schering España (Madrid, Spain). Culture plates were from Corning (Cambridge, MA). All salts used for buffer preparation were reagent grade. Bovine adrenal chromaffin cells, enriched in adrenaline, were prepared as described elsewhere (23.Moro M.A. López M.G. Gandı́a L.

Cells were planted on 12-mm diameter glass coverslips at an approximate density of 5 × 105 cells/coverslip. Cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment and used at room temperature between 1 and 4 days of culture. Carbon fiber microelectrodes were prepared as described (24.Kawagoe K.T. Zimmerman J.B. Wightman R.M. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1993; 48: 225-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Carbon fibers (5 μm radius; Thornel P-55, Amoco Corp., Greenville, SC) were the kind gift of Prof. R. M. Wightman (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, NC). Electrochemical recordings were performed using an Axopatch 200B (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). A fixed potential of +650 mV was maintained between the carbon fiber electrode versus an Ag/AgCl pellet reference electrode. Electrodes were backfilled with 3m KCl to connect to the headstage. Electrodes were tested with a flow-injection system with noradrenaline standard solutions using an EI-400 potentiostat (Ensman Inst. Bloomington, IN) (24.Kawagoe K.T. Zimmerman J.B. Wightman R.M. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1993; 48: 225-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Glass coverslips with adhering adrenal cells were washed in Krebs-HEPES buffer solution containing (in mm): NaCl (140), KCl (5.Marley P.D. McLeod J. Anderson C. Thomson K.A. J. Autonom. Nerv.

Pharmacol. 1997; 30: 419-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), brought to pH 7.35 with NaOH. Cells were placed in a perfusion chamber positioned on the stage of an inverted microscope (Leica DM-IRB, Wetzlar, Germany). Amperometric measurements were performed with the carbon fiber microelectrode gently touching the cell membrane. Cell release was stimulated by 5-s pressure ejection of 5 mm Ba2+ from a micropipette placed 40 μm away from the cell. Ba2+ was used as a secretagogue because it does not require receptor activation or membrane depolarization and because it produces a low frequency of secretory event, so that during spike analysis the initial and final points of each wave can be easily distinguished. Experiments using hypertonic solutions were performed as described previously (22.Borges R. Travis E.R. Hoechstetler S.E. Wightman R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8325-8331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated in hypertonic Krebs (750 mosm, obtained by adding NaCl) solution for 5 min, in the presence or in the absence of 10 μm SNP. Under these hypertonic conditions, secretion was elicited by pulse injection of isotonic Krebs solution. In order to reduce NO degradation, free O2 was reduced from the stock solution. Krebs solution was bubbled with pure N2 into a sealed bottle for about 60 min. Five milliliters of the above solution were transferred into 7-ml sealed vials and bubbled again for another 10 min, keeping a pure N2 atmosphere in the empty space. This degassing procedure reduced the pO2 to 15–20 mmHg (ABL-2, Radiometer, Copenhagen, Denmark), equivalent to 20–40 μm free O2. In a fume hood, NO gas was on-line bubbled through a sealed bottle containing 5 n NaOH, to get rid of acid-generated material and then to an empty 7-ml vial for 1 min at 0.5 bar, maintaining the flow for 5 min. Two milliliters of the deoxygenated solution were injected into the vial containing pure NO using a gas-tight syringe through a rubber stopper. The vial was kept at 4 °C and used within 2 h. NO concentration in the solution, measured by Griess method, was 2.8 mm. Amperometric signals were low-pass filtered at 1 KHz and sampled at 4 KHz and collected using a locally written software (Labview for Macintosh, National Instruments, Austin, TX). Data analysis was carried out using locally written macros for IGOR (Wavemetrics, Lake Oswego, OR). These macros allow the automatic digital filtering, secretory spike identification, and build histograms for spike classification. All the above macros are free shareware. Fig. 1 describes the parameters measured from each secretory spike. Once the beginning and the end points were found, the computer obtained the maximum amplitude of the oxidation current (I max), which was expressed in pA. The ascending slope (m) was determined from the linear part of the trace located between 25% and 75% of theI max; hence, this parameter is not affected by the presence of the pre-spike phenomenon (foot), m being expressed in nA/s. The time to peak (t P) was determined between the point at which the back-extrapolation of the slope line crossed the base line and the point ofI max. This parameter partially shows the slow dissociation of adrenaline from intragranular proteic matrix. Total granule release (Q) was obtained by integration of the curve, which indicates the amount of oxidizing substances released and is expressed in pC. Q was normalized as the cubic root (Q 1/3) and two spike fade constants (τ =I max− I max/e) and (τ′ = I max/e) taken from the adjusted exponential decay. Because of day-to-day variations in electrode sensitivity and cell responsiveness, significant differences were currently observed between untreated cells, used as controls, from different days. For this reason, effects of drugs on secretory spikes were compared with control experiments carried out under the same conditions. Statistical analysis was carried out by the non-parametric Mann-Whitney Utest. Glass coverslips with adhering adrenal cells were washed twice in Krebs buffer solution and incubated with 2 μm fura-2/AM (stock solution dissolved in 20% Pluronic F-127 in Me2SO) and 0.1% fetal calf serum for 45 min. Cells were then washed twice to remove extracellular dye and placed in the perfusion chamber, as described above. Intracellular Ba2+ was measured using a computer-operated monochromator (TILL Photonics, Munich, Germany) controlled by Labview software. Fluorescence signals were low-pass filtered at 510 nm and detected by a photomultiplier mounted to a viewfinder (TILL Photonics) that defined the area of interest over which the fluorescence intensity was integrated. Data of [Ba2+]c time courses were collected at 10 Hz and expressed as fluorescence ratios (F 360) and (F 380). The direct application of NO produced drastic effects on the time course of secretory spikes, which are summarized on TableI and II. These effects were reproduced with all of the NO donors tested (TableII). Spermine-NO was particularly potent promoting a fall in granules emptying kinetics. Incubation withS-nitrosoglutathione and direct NO application produced similar concentrationdependent changes, which relate closely to their described abilities for producing free NO (25.Ferrero R. Rodrı́guez-Pascual F. Miras-Portugal M.T. Torres M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 127: 779-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Spike decay was also affected; τ′ increased with 200 nm NO from 12.9 ms to 20.3, whereas τ changed from 27.1 to 42.3 ms, indicating that NO strongly slowed down the last phase of exocytosis. The observed spike shape changes were not caused by a decrease in electrode sensitivity, as SNP did not modify the oxidation curves observed in the flow stream system used for electrode calibration (data not shown).Table IThe effects of NO on secretory spike parametersI maxQt 12mt PnnpApCmsnA/smsspikescellsControl41.9 ± 1.81.4 ± 0.0624.8 ± 0.811.6 ± 0.620 ± 117617NO (20 nm)20.1 ± 0.91.0 ± 0.0533.1 ± 1.14.2 ± 0.233 ± 2 7168NO (200 nm)19.0 ± 1.11.1 ± 0.0741.0 ± 1.62.7 ± 0.251 ± 4 3326The effects of NO incubation are shown together with their own control cells (see “Results”).

Statistical analysis (Mann-Whitney U test) was performed on original data. Significant differences, p < 0.01 (**) or p < 0.001 (*). SNP was incubated at 10 μm. Fig. 2 shows histograms from secretory spikes obtained in the absence or in the presence of 10 μm of the NO donor SNP incubated for 10–20 min. SNP caused a dramatic reduction in the spike I max, averaging a fall to a 36% of control that was accompanied by at 1/2 average increase of 161% (Table II). Virtually, no spikes over 60 pA were found upon SNP treatment. Conversely, the number of events with a t 1/2 of over 40 ms was greatly increased. The releasing speed decayed as the ascending slopes of spikes were drastically reduced. The histogram in Fig. 2 shows that the number of secretory events with at P over 10 ms in duration was largely increased. NO effects were even more pronounced with 100 μm SNP, but a dramatic reduction in the number of spikes prevented us from using these data. Total granule release remained unaltered at low concentration of the drug, whereas a reduction was observed when SNP was raised to 10 μm. In order to rule out SNP effects caused by NO metabolites accumulated along drug incubation, 10 μm SNP was also applied for 10 s in the vicinity of a cell. The effects of this brief application, although less pronounced, were qualitatively similar (Table II); I max dropped from 45 to 34 pA, andt 1/2 rose 36%. Fig. 3 describes how NO affected the time course of spikes. Incubation with 100 μm spermine-NO for 10 min produced a drastic change in spike shape, which included a reduction in theI max and in the m (ascending slope), accompanied with an increase in the t P, τ, τ′, and t 1/2. The effect of NO on exocytotic kinetics occurs in few seconds (Fig. 4).Figure 4Time course of NO effects on quantal release.

Calibration barsare shown on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Due to the large differences within control data from one day to another, each treatment was compared with its own untreated control cells, from the culture of the same day using the same electrode. TableII shows data normalized with their own control. Although the effects of NO on total CA released by Ba2+ were not analyzed in detail, a discrete reduction in spike firing, of about 15%, was observed. In addition, the average spike charge observed was reduced by 20–40%. The guanylate cyclase PKG is known to be the main cellular transduction system for NO. In order to test if cGMP could mimic the NO effects, cells were treated with 10 μm cGMP-permeable analog 8-Br-cGMP. Results are summarized on Table II. Incubation for 20–30 min caused changes of spike shape qualitatively similar to those found with NO and NO donors. The secretory speed was profoundly slowed, and spikes were indistinguishable from NO-treated cells. Similarly, τ values were affected to the same extend, τ′ increased from 9.47 to 12.7 ms, whereas τ changed from 20.8 to 31.4 ms, indicating that cGMP affected as well the very last phase of exocytosis. Endogenous cellular levels of cGMP can also be increased by inhibiting its degradation. Table II shows the effects of 20 min of incubation with two phosphodiesterase inhibitors, IBMX and the more specific inhibition of cGMP-phosphodiesterase, zaprinast. When applied alone, both substances produced net changes on spike shape similar to those observed with NO donors. In the presence of 10 μm SNP, slight additive effects were observed, suggesting that both agents act through the same mechanism. Zaprinast increased τ′ from 13.4 to 22.5 ms and τ from 30 to 49.3 ms, whereas these values were increased by IBMX from 19 to 24.7 ms and 36.6 to 47.3 ms, respectively; the addition of SNP did not significantly modify the τ values obtained with IBMX. Cells were treated with l-NAME at 37 °C for 30 min and exocytotic spikes recorded in the presence of the drug. Lowl-NAME concentrations (10 μm) promoted significant changes on the spike t 1/2,m, and t P values (Table II). Although data obtained with 100 μml-NAME were qualitatively similar, they should be interpreted with caution because of the total granule release reduction observed (44%). The effects ofl-NAME persisted during incubation but rapidly disappeared upon drug removal, indicating a reversible NOS inhibition. Highl-NAME concentrations (1 mm) resulted in a drastic reduction of the number of secretory spikes, probably due to a nonspecific or toxic effect (data not shown). The presence of NOS within chromaffin cells suggested the existence of a NO basal tone which probably modulates continuously the kinetics of the exocytosis. This basal tone was revealed by NO sequestration using NO scavengers. Table II shows the effects of cell incubation with methylene blue and C-PTIO on Ba2+-evoked secretory spikes. Neither methylene blue nor C-PTIO caused CA release. However, both agents induced a concentration-dependent reduction of the t 1/2, which was accompanied with an increase in m and a shortening oft P. C-PTIO was more potent than methylene blue, probably because of its specificity and ability to serve as NO scavenger; the I max was significantly increased to 223% after only 4–5 min of incubation, revealing the presence of a basal NO activity within cultured cells. An unexpected effect observed with NO scavengers was the changes found on spike charge. Table IIshows that C-PTIO increased Q, whereas methylene blue induced a reduction. However, in all cases, an increase in theI max together with a reduction int 1/2 and τ was observed. Fig. 3 summarizes the effect of 10 min of incubation with a low concentration of C-PTIO (10 nm); spikes became taller and thinner, and the CA concentration reaching electrode was much bigger. Note that NO could account for 10-fold changes in the CA concentration reaching electrode (I max). One possible target site of NO could be the interference with Ba2+ movements. A series of experiments was done measuring [Ba2+]c in the absence and in the presence of 10 μm SNP. Fig. 5 shows representative traces ofF 360/F 380 ratios obtained with cells loaded with fura-2. Cells treated with SNP showed no changes on the ascending part of the traces. However, a significant increase on [Ba2+]c of 18 ± 2% was observed on the plateau of [Ba2+]c traces (6 cells of each group). In any case, the increased [Ba2+]clevels were maintained in both groups of cells for 6–8 min after the stimulus, the time usually taken for amperometric recording. A series of experiments was carried out in order to elucidate the cellular target site for NO. Foot (pre-spike feature) duration indicates the elapsed time for formation of the fusion pore. If a given substance modifies the fusion pore machinery, the duration of the foot might be altered. However, no differences on foot duration were found between foot produced in control conditions and cells incubated with 10 μm SNP: 17.4 ± 1.1 ms (n = 99) versus 15.5 ± 1.2 ms (n = 84), or 8-Br-cGMP: 14.8 ± 0.8 ms (n = 87) versus 15.6 ± 1.3 ms (n = 64). In amperometric recordings, only the 35% of spikes exhibited foot (13.Finnegan J.M. Pihel K. Cahill P.S. Huang L. Zerby S.E. Edwing A.G. Kennedy R.T. Wightman R.M. J.

J. 1996; 70: 1061-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In this study, measurements were only performed on spikes where the beginning and finishing points of foot were clearly distinguishable. We have shown that cell stimulation under conditions of high tonicity (i.e. >700 mosm), promoted the partial exocytosis of chromaffin granules (22.Borges R. Travis E.R. Hoechstetler S.E. Wightman R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8325-8331Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Ba2+ application caused an increase in the [Ba2+]c, which was not accompanied by secretory spikes. However, exocytotic pore formation had already occurred, as demonstrated by the fact that brief pressure injection of isotonic saline caused many exocytotic events, which lasted throughout the time of application. These secretory spikes had lost 50% of their content, and they did not possess foot because they came from pre-fusioned granules that could only swell in response to isotonic media (Fig. 1S⃞). After Ba2+ stimulation under hypertonic conditions, granules were already opened; changes produced in spike shape must not be caused by an effect on the fusion pore but on another target, probably on the affinity of CA for the intragranular matrix. Data obtained from Fig. 6 (table inset) show significant changes on spike shape obtained from pre-fusioned granules, which mimicked those produced under normal conditions. Moreover, pre-fusioned granules progressively lost CA, indicated by the gradual fall in Q values along the time from Ba2+ stimulation. NO partially prevented this loss. As shown in Fig. 6, there were statistical differences betweenQ values obtained from control and SNP groups, indicating that NO increased the affinity of CA for its intragranular matrix. The results of this study demonstrate that NO, even at low concentrations, produces profound effects on the kinetics of secretory spikes (Figs. 2 and 3). We also show that exocytosis is modulated by a basal NO tone present within the cultured cells. Our data suggest that most of the NO action is carried out through the guanylate cyclase PKG pathway, as incubation with cGMP analog 8-Br-cGMP and phosphodiesterase inhibitors mimicked NO effects. Previous studies have reported changes on spike shape by altering temperature (21.Pihel K. Travis E.R. Borges R. Wightman R.M. Biophys.

https://openalex.org/W1997836839,"Recent evidence has indicated a requirement for a Src family kinase in initiating Ca2+ release at fertilization in starfish eggs (Giusti, A. F., Carroll, D. J., Abassi, Y. A., Terasaki, M., Foltz, K. R., and Jaffe, L. A. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 29318–29322). We now show that injection of Src protein into starfish eggs initiates Ca2+ release and DNA synthesis, as occur at fertilization. These responses depend on the phosphorylation state of the Src protein; only the kinase active form is effective. Like Ca2+ release at fertilization, the Ca2+ release in response to Src protein injection is inhibited by prior injection of the SH2 domains of phospholipase Cγ. These findings support the conclusion that in starfish, sperm-egg interaction causes egg activation by sequential activation of a Src-like kinase and phospholipase Cγ. Injection of the SH2 domain of Src, which inhibits Ca2+ release at fertilization, does not inhibit Ca2+ release caused by Src protein injection. This indicates that the requirement for a Src SH2 domain interaction is upstream of Src activation in the pathway leading to Ca2+ release at fertilization.

Much recent work on fertilization has focused on the signal transduction pathways that lead to IP3 production. The phospholipase C family of enzymes produces IP3 and diacylglycerol from the membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (11.Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). In echinoderm eggs, it is the γ isoform of phospholipase C (PLCγ) that functions at fertilization. PLCγ enzyme activity increases by 30 s post-fertilization in sea urchin eggs (12.Rongish B.J. Wu W. Kinsey W.H. Dev. Biol. 1999; 215: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and inhibition of PLCγ activation inhibits Ca2+release at fertilization in both sea urchin and starfish eggs (13.Carroll D.J.

Development. 1999; 126: 2273-2284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these experiments, PLCγ activity was inhibited by injection of eggs with excess Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of PLCγ. SH2 domains are found in many signaling proteins, and provide a site for specific interaction of a particular protein with a particular phosphorylated tyrosine on another protein (16.Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2228) Google Scholar). Excess SH2 domains, introduced into cells by microinjection, function as specific dominant negative inhibitors of such interactions. PLCγ can be activated by phosphorylation of a regulatory tyrosine, although other factors may also be significant (17.Kamat A. Carpenter G. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 1997; 8: 109-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 18.Singer W.D. Brown H.A. Sternweis P.C. Annu. Rev.

In sea urchin eggs, attempts to determine if PLCγ is tyrosine phosphorylated at fertilization have been inconclusive, since the phosphotyrosine in PLCγ immunoprecipitates was barely detectable either before or after fertilization (12.Rongish B.J. Wu W. Kinsey W.H. Dev. Biol. 1999; 215: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 21.De Nadai C. Cailliau K. Epel D. Ciapa B. Dev. Growth Diff. 1998; 40: 669-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As discussed by these authors, a local increase at the site of sperm-egg interaction might have been too small to detect by the methods used. Nevertheless, tyrosine kinase activity increases within 15 s after fertilization (22.Ciapa B. Epel D. FEBS Lett. 1991; 295: 167-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein delays Ca2+ release at fertilization (23.Shen S.S. Kinsey W.H. Lee S-J. Dev. Growth Differ. 1999; 41: 345-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). One group of tyrosine kinases that participates, directly or indirectly, in activation of PLCγ is the Src family (20.Zhang X. Chattopadhyay A. Ji Q.-S. Owen J.D. Ruest P.J. Carpenter G. Hanks S.K.

Carroll D.J. Abassi Y.A. Foltz K.R. Dev. Biol. 1999; 208: 189-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Further evidence that a Src family kinase functions to activate PLCγ at fertilization comes from findings that in both starfish and sea urchin eggs, injection of excess SH2 domains of Src family kinases inhibits Ca2+ release at fertilization (28.Giusti A.F. Carroll D.J. Abassi Y.A. Terasaki M. Foltz K.R. Jaffe L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29318-29322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 29.Abassi Y.A. Carroll D.J. Giusti A.F. Belton R.J. Foltz K.R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 218: 206-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). In addition, in sea urchin eggs, the Src family kinase inhibitor PP1 delays Ca2+ release at fertilization, and the activity of a Src-like kinase increases by 30 s post-insemination (29.Abassi Y.A. Carroll D.J. Giusti A.F. Belton R.J. Foltz K.R. Dev. Biol. 2000; 218: 206-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that a Src-like kinase may, directly or through intermediate molecules, activate PLCγ at fertilization, leading to Ca2+ release and egg activation. In this report, we examine four questions related to this model. 1) Is the kinase activity of the Src-like protein required for Ca2+ release? 2) Does a Src-like protein initiate DNA synthesis as well as Ca2+release? 3) Does the Src-like protein act upstream of PLCγ? 4) Do the SH2 domains of the Src-like protein interact with an upstream or downstream component of the pathway? We approached these questions by injecting starfish eggs with human cSrc protein that was produced in insect cells. The activity of Src family kinases is regulated by phosphorylation of two tyrosines: phosphorylation of an internal tyrosine (Tyr-419 in human cSrc) is stimulatory, while phosphorylation of the COOH-terminal tyrosine (Tyr-530) is inhibitory (30.Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). A third tyrosine phosphorylation site has also been identified, but its functional significance is not known (31.Barker S.C. Kassel D.B. Weigl D. Huang X. Luther M.A. Knight W.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14843-14851Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). We injected starfish eggs with Src protein that was either completely unphosphorylated, or phosphorylated on Tyr-530 only. Unphosphorylated Src protein will, in the presence of ATP in the cytoplasm, rapidly autophosphorylate on Tyr-419, resulting in a fully active protein (Ref. 32.Boerner R.J. Kassel D.B. Barker S.C. Ellis B. DeLacy P. Knight W.B. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9519-9525Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar and see “Discussion”). Phosphorylation of Tyr-530 locks Src in a closed conformation in which intramolecular interactions among the SH3, SH2, and kinase domains down-regulate the kinase activity (33.Xu W. Harrison S.C.

We then injected eggs with the SH2 domains of PLCγ, followed by unphosphorylated Src protein, to investigate whether Src releases Ca2+ by way of PLCγ. We also injected eggs with the SH2 domains of Src, followed by unphosphorylated Src protein, to determine whether, in the pathway leading to PLCγ activation at fertilization, the requirement for the Src SH2 domain is upstream or downstream of the activation of the Src-like kinase. An NH2-terminal deletion mutant of human cSrc (N-85-srcTK, amino acids 86–536) was expressed in baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells (31.Barker S.C. Kassel D.B. Weigl D. Huang X. Luther M.A. Knight W.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14843-14851Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The Src fraction that was phosphorylated on Tyr-530, and not on the other two tyrosine phosphorylation sites, was purified as described previously (33.Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). Unphosphorylated Src was purified with a combination of ATP-Sepharose, phosphotyrosine, and anion-exchange chromatography. The phosphorylation state of the protein fractions was confirmed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry after trypsin digestion, two-dimensional phospho-peptide mapping, kinase assay, and immunoblotting using a Tyr-530 phosphospecific Src antibody (44-662, 0.25 μg/ml; BIOSOURCE International, Camarillo, CA). A non-phosphospecific Src antibody (SC-18, 0.4 μg/ml; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was used as a control. The blots were developed using a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody against rabbit IgG (SC-2030, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Src protein solutions used for injection contained 7.5–8.0 mg/ml protein in 20 mmHepes (pH 7.5), 0.1 m NaCl, and 5 mmdithiothreitol. Protein concentrations were determined using a BCA assay (Pierce Chemical Co., Rockford, IL) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. SH2 domain glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were made in bacteria and purified as described previously (13.Carroll D.J. Ramarao C.S. Mehlmann L.M. Roche S. Terasaki M. Jaffe L.A. J.

SH2 domain protein solutions for injection contained 33 mg/ml protein and 330 μm calcium green dextran in 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 8.1 mmNa2HPO4, and 1.5 mmKH2PO4 (pH 7.2). Starfish (Asterina miniata) were obtained from Marinus, Inc. (Long Beach, CA) and from Will Borgeson (Bodega Marine Lab, Bodega Bay, CA). Oocytes were collected as described previously (13.Carroll D.J. Ramarao C.S. Mehlmann L.M. Roche S. Terasaki M. Jaffe L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Quantitative microinjection was performed using mercury-filled micropipettes (37.Hiramoto Y. Exp. Cell Res. 1962; 27: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 38.Kiehart D.P. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 25: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Calcium green dextran, Oregon green dUTP, and SH2 domain proteins were injected into immature oocytes; 1 μm 1-methyladenine (Sigma) was then applied to cause oocyte maturation. In one set of experiments, we confirmed that PLCγ SH2 domains have the same effect on Ca2+ release, whether they are injected before or after oocyte maturation (see also Ref. 13.Carroll D.J. Ramarao C.S. Mehlmann L.M. Roche S. Terasaki M. Jaffe L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Src proteins were injected into mature eggs at first meiotic metaphase, 40–160 min after the initial injection. Injection volumes were 1–5% of the egg volume (3100 picoliters), and concentrations given in the text indicate the final values in the egg cytoplasm. IP3 (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) was used as a 10 μm stock, and 5% of the egg volume was injected. All experiments were performed at 16–18 °C, with the eggs in natural sea water. Intracellular free Ca2+measurements were made in eggs injected with 10 μmcalcium green 10-kDa dextran (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and calcium green fluorescence was detected with a photodiode (71182; Oriel Instruments, Stratford, CT) using a ×40, 0.75 N.A. objective (Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY), or a confocal microscope (MRC600; Bio-Rad) using a ×20, 0.5 N.A. objective, as described previously (13.Carroll D.J.

Data were analyzed using an unpaired t test (Instat software; GraphPad, San Diego, CA) to calculate p values. pValues < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. Figures were assembled using NIH Image, Photoshop (Adobe Systems, Inc., Seattle, WA), and Freehand (Macromedia, Inc., San Francisco, CA). DNA synthesis was detected in eggs preinjected with 1–2 μm Oregon green 488-5-dUTP (Molecular Probes) as described previously (14.Carroll D.J. Albay D.T. Terasaki M. Jaffe L.A. Foltz K.R. Dev. Biol. 1999; 206: 232-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). After injection of Src protein, eggs were cultured for 2.5–5 h at 16–18 °C. DNA synthesis was detected by the observation of fluorescent chromatin, using a confocal microscope (Bio-Rad). The image shown in Fig. 4 was obtained with a ×40, 1.3 N.A. objective (488 nm, low laser power, 10% neutral density filter, zoom 2.5). The presence or absence of DNA synthesis was confirmed by photobleaching to remove unincorporated Oregon green dUTP from the cytoplasm (14.Carroll D.J. Albay D.T. Terasaki M. Jaffe L.A. Foltz K.R. Dev. Biol. 1999; 206: 232-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). If fluorescent chromatin was not visible, the nucleus was located by coinjection of 70-kDa Texas Red dextran (Molecular Probes), which is excluded from the nucleus (13.Carroll D.J. Ramarao C.S. Mehlmann L.M. Roche S. Terasaki M. Jaffe L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The photobleaching area (78 × 43 μm) was positioned away from the nucleus or chromatin mass, and the egg was exposed to 7 sets of 10 scans (×20, 0.5 N.A. objective, 488 nm, full laser power, zoom 8.5, slow scan setting). After photobleaching, eggs that had synthesized DNA retained fluorescence in the chromatin, while eggs that had not synthesized DNA showed no nuclear fluorescence. The figure was prepared using Photoshop (Adobe). Human c-Src protein (amino acid residues 86–536) was produced in insect cells, and two major phosphorylation forms were purified: unphosphorylated (P−Src) and monophosphorylated at Tyr-530 (PY530Src). Both phosphorylation forms contain the catalytic, SH2, and SH3 domains, but lack the NH2-terminal hydrophobic domain by which Src associates with membranes (Fig. 1). In the presence of the ATP in the cytoplasm, P−Src will rapidly autophosphorylate on Tyr-419 and acquire high enzymatic activity (see “Discussion”). Injection of P−Src into starfish eggs (370 μg/ml = 7.2 μm final concentration) caused Ca2+release in all eggs tested (n = 31), beginning ∼1.6 min after injection (Fig. 2 B, Table I). Ca2+ was detected using calcium green dextran; the fluorescence reached a peak that was 74 ± 18% greater than the baseline level (S.D.,n = 31). This Ca2+ increase was somewhat smaller than that seen at fertilization (Fig. 2 A), where the peak fluorescence increase was 102 ± 15% (n = 5), using the same optical measurement conditions. The Ca2+rise caused by Src protein injection usually lasted for several minutes, although the duration was generally somewhat shorter than at fertilization (compare Fig. 2, A and B). Src protein injection also caused partial or complete elevation of the fertilization envelope, indicating the occurrence of partial or complete cortical granule exocytosis. Ca2+ release in response to injection of Src protein was concentration dependent, and occurred in only 50% of eggs injected with P−Src at a final concentration of 220 μg/ml (4.3 μm). Ca2+ release was not detected when the Src protein concentration was reduced to 75 μg/ml (1.5 μm) (TableI).Table ICalcium release in starfish eggs injected with Src proteinProtein injected% with a Ca rise >10% of baselineDelay Mean ± S.D.No. of eggs, No. of animalsμg/mlminP−Src3701001.6 ± 0.531, 8220502.3 ± 0.5 8, 3750 4, 2 PY530Src4000 7, 2 PLCγSH2 → P−Src 1000 → 370804.2 ± 1.2aSignificantly different from that for eggs injected with P−Src alone, or with SHP2SH2 followed by P−Src (p < 0.0002).10, 3 SHP2SH2 → P−Src 1000 → 3701001.8 ± 0.6 8, 3SrcSH2 → P−Src 1000 → 3701001.8 ± 0.411, 3AblSH2 → P−Src 1000 → 3701001.8 ± 0.4 8, 3Starfish eggs were injected with Src protein, in either the unphosphorylated form (P−Src) or the tyrosine 530-phosphorylated form (PY530Src), while measuring calcium green dextran fluorescence.

Ca2+ rises <10% of baseline were not distinguishable from baseline noise and drift, and were not included in these calculations. Confocal imaging of calcium green dextran fluorescence following Src injection (370 μg/ml) showed that the Ca2+ rise occurred in a wave that started after the characteristic delay described above, from a site near the plasma membrane toward which the solution had been expelled from the micropipette (Fig. 3) (n = 6). The Ca2+ wave closely resembled that seen at fertilization (see Refs. 13.Carroll D.J. Ramarao C.S. Mehlmann L.M. Roche S. Terasaki M. Jaffe L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar and 28.Giusti A.F. Carroll D.J. Abassi Y.A. Terasaki M. Foltz K.R. Jaffe L.A. J. Biol.

It differed from the pattern of Ca2+ release seen when eggs were injected with IP3, where the Ca2+ release began immediately, and from the site of injection rather than from the egg surface (Fig.3) (n = 4). To examine whether the kinase activity of the Src protein was required for the Ca2+ release in response to injection of the protein, we purified, from the mixture of Src forms produced by the insect cells, Src protein that was monophosphorylated on the inhibitory tyrosine at the COOH terminus (PY530Src) (Fig. 1, B andC). In this phosphorylation state, the Src tyrosine kinase activity is down-regulated, even in the presence of ATP (30.Brown M.T. Cooper J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 121-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar, 32.Boerner R.J. Kassel D.B. Barker S.C. Ellis B. DeLacy P. Knight W.B.

Nature. 1997; 385: 650-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). Upon injection into starfish eggs (400 μg/ml = 7.8 μm), PY530Src caused little or no Ca2+release; any calcium green dextran fluorescence increase that occurred was always less than 10% of the baseline fluorescence (Fig.2 C, Table I). These results indicate that kinase activity is required for Ca2+ release in response to Src injection. The resumption of the cell cycle is a common feature of fertilization in all species; in the starfish A. miniata, this is marked by the occurrence of DNA synthesis at about 2 h after fertilization (40.Carroll D.J. Jaffe L.A. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 690-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 41.Sadler K.C. Ruderman J.V. Dev. Biol. 1998; 197: 25-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We examined whether injection of starfish eggs with P−Src protein caused DNA synthesis. DNA synthesis was detected by preinjecting the eggs with a fluorescent nucleotide analog, Oregon green dUTP (see Ref. 14.Carroll D.J. Albay D.T. Terasaki M. Jaffe L.A. Foltz K.R. Dev. Biol. 1999; 206: 232-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, and “Experimental Procedures”). 2.5–5 h after injection of active Src protein (P−Src), we examined the eggs using confocal microscopy. In 15 of 18 eggs, a condensed cluster of Oregon green dUTP-labeled chromatin was visible (Fig. 4). In 4 of these eggs, we confirmed that DNA synthesis had occurred by photobleaching to remove unincorporated Oregon green dUTP. Photobleaching in a region of the egg cytoplasm away from the chromatin did not remove the chromatin fluorescence; this showed that the fluorescent nucleotides in the chromatin region were no longer diffusible, indicating that they had been incorporated into DNA (see Ref. 14.Carroll D.J. Albay D.T. Terasaki M. Jaffe L.A. Foltz K.R. Dev. Biol. 1999; 206: 232-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, and “Experimental Procedures”). In contrast, a parallel set of experiments showed that eggs injected with catalytically inhibited Src protein (PY530Src) did not undergo DNA synthesis (n = 3). In the PY530Src injected eggs, no Oregon green dUTP fluorescence remained in the egg cytoplasm after photobleaching. These results showed that elevating Src kinase activity in starfish eggs stimulates DNA synthesis, as occurs at fertilization. Although some eggs subsequently showed multiple nuclei or irregular cleavage, no further development was observed. The failure of the Src-injected eggs to undergo normal cell division and development might be due to the absence of the sperm centriole that normally provides the mitosis organizing center in the fertilized egg (42.Washitani-Nemoto S. Saitoh C. Nemoto S. Dev. Biol. 1994; 163: 293-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To examine whether the Ca2+ release in response to injection of P−Src occurred by the same pathway as at fertilization, we investigated whether the P−Src response was inhibited by preinjection of the SH2 domains of PLCγ. As described previously (13.Carroll D.J. Ramarao C.S. Mehlmann L.M. Roche S. Terasaki M. Jaffe L.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1303-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), injection of PLCγ SH2 domains (1 mg/ml) delays and reduces Ca2+release at fertilization (Fig.5 A). Injection of PLCγ SH2 domains (1 mg/ml) also had an inhibitory effect on Ca2+release following injection of P−Src (Fig. 5 B, Table I). Two of the 10 eggs tested showed no Ca2+ release in response to P−Src injection. Eight of the 10 eggs eventually released Ca2+, but the delay between injection of the P−Src and Ca2+ release was significantly longer than in eggs containing the SH2 domains of a control protein, the phosphatase SHP2 (Fig. 5 C, Table I). Tests of PLCγ and SHP2 SH2 domains were carried out alternately in each set of experiments. Although the peak amplitude of the calcium green fluorescence in P−Src injected eggs containing PLCγ SH2 domains was not significantly different from that in eggs containing control SH2 domains, the Ca2+ elevation in the PLCγ SH2-injected eggs was usually shorter in duration and often consisted of several brief peaks instead of the sustained rise observed in the control-injected eggs (compare Fig. 5, B andC). The increase in the delay between P−Src injection and Ca2+ release, caused by PLCγ SH2 domains, indicates that both fertilization and P−Src initiate Ca2+ release by way of PLCγ. Injection of starfish eggs with the SH2 domain of Src also delays and inhibits Ca2+ release at fertilization (Ref. 28.Giusti A.F. Carroll D.J. Abassi Y.A. Terasaki M. Foltz K.R. Jaffe L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29318-29322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar; Fig.6 A). This could result from an inhibition of the interaction of a Src-like kinase either with an upstream regulator of Src activation, or with a downstream target of the activated kinase. To examine these alternatives, we investigated whether injecting eggs with Src SH2 domains inhibited Ca2+release in response to subsequent injection of P−Src. We found that Src SH2 domains did not prevent the Ca2+ rise in response to P−Src, and did not significantly increase the delay between P−Src injection and the Ca2+rise (Fig. 6 B Table I), or reduce the amplitude of the Ca2+ rise relative to that in eggs preinjected with SH2 domains of a control protein, the tyrosine kinase Abl. These results support the conclusion that in the pathway leading to PLCγ activation and Ca2+ release at fertilization, the requirement for a Src SH2 domain interaction is upstream of the activation of the endogenous Src-like kinase. By injecting starfish eggs with the tyrosine kinase Src, we have demonstrated that Src kinase activity is sufficient to initiate Ca2+ release quite similar to that at fertilization, and to initiate DNA synthesis as occurs at fertilization.

We have shown previously that murine microglia bind and internalize fAβ microaggregates via the type A scavenger receptor, but degradation of internalized fAβ is significantly slower than normal degradation. In this study, we compared internalization by microglia of fAβ microaggregates to that of anti-Aβ-antibody-coated fAβ (IgG-fAβ) microaggregates and found that the uptake of the latter is increased by about 1.5-foldversus unmodified fAβ. The endocytic trafficking of IgG-fAβ is similar to that of fAβ microaggregates, following an endosomal/lysosomal pathway. We also compared the internalization of fAβ microaggregates to that of complement protein, C1q-coated fAβ microaggregates, and found that the levels of uptake are also increased by about 1.5-fold. Rates of degradation of both types of modified fAβ microaggregates are unchanged compared with unmodified fAβ microaggregates. We demonstrated by blocking studies that internalization of IgG-fAβ is mediated by Fc receptors. These data suggest that, in vivo, several different microglial receptors may play a part in internalizing fAβ, but the involvement of other receptors may not increase the degradation of fAβ.

The disease is characterized by the presence of two types of senile plaques: classical, dense core plaques and diffuse plaques. Dense core plaques are complex lesions of the cortical neuropil containing several abnormal elements. The major component of the dense plaque is fibrillar β-amyloid (Aβ), a fragment of 40 or 42 amino acids derived from a larger membrane-spanning glycoprotein called β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) (1.Selkoe D.J. Neuron. 1991; 6: 487-498Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar). Additionally, astrocytes and activated microglia are frequently associated with dense plaques (2.Haga S. Ikeda K.

Acta Neuropathol. 1982; 57: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) detected small amounts of IgG and light chains (kappa and lambda) in the corona of degenerating neurites around the central amyloid core of the senile plaque. Moreover, studies show the presence of antibodies that recognize microglia in the cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients (20.McRae A. Ling E.A. Wigander A. Dahlstrom A. Mol. Chem. Neuropathol. 1996; 28: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 21.Dahlstrom A. McRae A. Polinsky R. Nee L. Sadasivan B. Ling E.A. Mol. Neurobiol. 1994; 9: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The role of these proteins in facilitating assembly of amyloid fibrils or in promoting neuron damage is unclear. It has long been recognized that reactive microglia are closely associated with dense core plaques in AD, suggesting that these cells may be involved with the removal and/or the production of Aβ fibrils. Similarly, activated microglia are also found associated with plaques that develop in a transgenic mouse model of AD (22.Frautschy S.A. Yang F. Izrizarry M.C. Hyman B.T. Saido T.C. Hsiao K. Cole G.M.

Bartel S. Broker J. Li X. Kirkpatrick J.B. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 7712-7726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The origin of microglia is still controversial, although evidence suggests that their lineage is myelo-monocytic (26.Schmidtmayer J. Jacobsen C. Miksch G. Sievers J. Glia. 1994; 12: 259-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar,27.Papavasilou A.K. Mehler M.F. Dobrenis K. Marmur R. Mabie P.C. Kessler J.A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1996; 46: 49-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Most cells of monocytic lineage, such as Kupffer cells, Langerhans cells, alveolar macrophages, and microglia, express surface immune molecules and play a key role in local immunological events (28.Shevach E.M. Paul W.E. Fundamental Immunology. Raven Press, New York1985: 71-107Google Scholar). In normal adult brain, microglia are highly ramified, quiescent cells that become activated during CNS injury (29.Rio-Hortega P.D. Penfield W. Cytology and Cellular Pathology of the Nervous System. Paul P. Hocker, Inc., New York1932: 481-584Google Scholar). Upon activation, microglia are capable of releasing cytotoxic agents such as proteolytic enzymes, cytokines, complement proteins, reactive oxygen intermediates and nitric oxide (30.Giulian D. Corpuz M. Chapman S. Mansouri M. Robertson C. J. Neurosci. Res. 1993; 36: 681-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The presence of activated microglia in plaques and the association of complement components and acute phase proteins have led to the hypothesis that plaques are a site of chronic inflammation (31.Giulian D. J. Neurosci. Res. 1987; 18: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 32.Meda L. Cassatella M.A. Szendrei G.I. Otvos J.L. Baron P. Villalba M. Ferrari D. Rossi F.

Because AD involves the net accumulation of fAβ, it is important to understand both the synthesis and clearance of fAβ. We have shown that type A scavenger receptors (SRA) (34.Goldstein J.L. Ho Y.K.

Nature. 1996; 382: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that these receptors mediate binding of microglia to deposits of fAβ (38.El-Khoury J. Hickman S.E. Thomas C.A. Cao L. Silverstein S.C. Loike J.D. Nature. 1996; 382: 716-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Histopathological analysis of AD brain tissue showed strong expression of the scavenger receptor (SR) on reactive microglia associated with plaques (39.Christie R.H. Freeman M. Hyman B.T. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 399-403PubMed Google Scholar). These data raise the possibility that SR is involved in clearance of fAβ from the brain. However, a recent study (40.Huang F. Buttini M.

This indicates that, in the mouse brain, clearance of fAβ via SRA is not a rate-determining step in amyloid accumulation. The degradation of microaggregates of fAβ via SRs was followed for up to 3 days after internalization, both biochemically and immunocytochemically, and it was found that microglia showed intracellular accumulation of fAβ and slow, incomplete degradation of fAβ (42.Paresce D.M. Chung H. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29390-29397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). In further studies of fAβ degradation by microglia, we measured its degradation over a longer chase period: over the course of 12 days (43.Chung H. Brazil M.I. Soe T.T. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32301-32308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). After a short internalization pulse, there was slow, partial degradation for 3 days, but after that time, degradation stopped. Interestingly, undegraded fAβ was released from microglia throughout the 12 days, even though the degradative function of late endosomes/lysosomes was intact. Although there is evidence to suggest that microglia may play a harmful role in AD, these cells could also be protective if they digested amyloid fibrils. It has been suggested that clearance of amyloid deposits following immunization against Aβ with Aβ42 in a mouse model for AD may occur via microglial cells (44.Schenk D. Barbour R. Dunn W. Gordon G. Grajeda H. Guido T. Hi K. Haung J. Johnson-Wood K. Khan K. Kholodenko D. Lee M. Liao Z. Leiberburg I. Motter R. Mutter L. Soriano F. Shopp G. Vasquez N. Vandevert C. Walker S. Wogulis M. Yednock T.

Seubert P. McConlogue L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1550-1555Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar), with Aβ42. The immunizations were carried out either before the onset of AD-type neuropathologies (6 weeks of age) or at an older age (11 months) when fAβ deposits and several neuropathologies are well established. Immunization prevented the development of plaques in the younger animals while markedly reducing the extent and progression of the plaques in the older animals. One can infer from these data that fAβ deposits can be degraded as a consequence of immunization. Almost all of the mice developed and maintained serum antibody titers against Aβ42. Hippocampal sections contained unusual punctate structures that were reactive with anti-Aβ antibodies, several of which appeared to be Aβ-containing cells. Similar cells in adjacent sections stained positively for major histocompatibility class II and phenotypically resembled activated microglia. Together, these data suggest, contrary to our in vitro results, that microglia are able to degrade fAβ efficiently. In light of these new data, we investigated whether primary microglial cultures can take up modified fAβ, and if so, whether there is an increase in degradation of this fAβ by microglia. We prepared fAβ microaggregates and bound anti-Aβ antibody, 4G8, to microaggregates to produce 4G8-coated Aβ microaggregates (IgG-fAβ). We also prepared C1q-coated Aβ microaggregates (C1q-fAβ). In this paper, we address a number of issues: 1) Can IgG-fAβ or C1q-fAβ microaggregates be endocytosed by microglia? 2) Does modification affect the rate of degradation of fAβ microaggregates? 3) Is the trafficking of IgG-fAβ microaggregates different from that of fAβ microaggregates? and 4) Which receptor(s) mediate(s) uptake of IgG-fAβ? We show that the modifications of fAβ affect receptor utilization, but the rates of degradation of both IgG-fAβ and C1q-fAβ are similar to that of unmodified fAβ microaggregates. We prepared primary cultures of mixed glia from newborn mice and then isolated the weakly adherent microglia from cell monolayers according to previously described methods (37.Paresce D.M. Ghosh R.N. Maxfield F.R. Neuron. 1996; 17: 553-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 42.Paresce D.M. Chung H. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29390-29397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). To prepare primary cultures of mixed glia, we obtained neocortical tissues of newborn mice, removed the meninges, minced and incubated the tissues in 2.5% trypsin (Worthington Biochemical Corp., Freehold, NJ) and 0.01% deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) (Worthington) in phosphate-buffered saline for 5 min at 37 °C. The tissue was triturated with fire-polished pipettes in 0.1 mg/ml DNase I in Dulbecco's modified Eagles's medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Inc) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and penicillin/streptomycin. The supernatant was passed through a 145-μm mesh, recentrifuged for 5 min, resuspended, passed through a 33-μm mesh, and centrifuged one more time. Cells were resuspended in growth medium and plated in 75-cm2 flasks at a density of about 1.5–2.0 × 107 cells per flask. The mixed glial cultures were grown in bicarbonate-buffered DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified air atmosphere. The mixed glial cultures were grown for 1 week before microglia were collected from the flasks. The cultures were then shaken to release microglia every 3–4 days for 2–3 weeks. Microglia were harvested by orbital shaking at 150 rpm for 30–60 min in DMEM. Cells were plated onto 35-mm tissue culture dishes, whose bottoms had been replaced with poly-d-lysine-coated No. 1 glass coverslips. We used the uptake of DiI-Ac-LDL (Molecular Probes) by microglia to assess the purity of our microglial cultures, because microglia, unlike astroglia or oligodendroglia, express SRA and take up Ac-LDL. Over 95% of the cells harvested after shaking took up DiI-Ac-LDL. β-amyloid-(1–42) peptide was purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA). The lyophilized powder was diluted in sterile water to 5 mg/ml and kept at −80 °C. Fluorescent β-amyloid was prepared by derivatizing with Cy3, an orange fluorescing carbocyanine dye (Biological Detection Systems Inc., Pittsburgh, PA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Aβ42 was dissolved at 1 mg/ml in 0.1 m sodium carbonate/sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.3, then added to the Cy3 dye. The labeled protein was separated from excess, unconjugated dye by dialysis. This stock of Cy3-sAβ at pH 9.3 was kept at 4 °C. For all our studies on the uptake of Cy3-labeled fAβ and unlabeled fAβ, the peptide was aggregated into small fibrillar structures (microaggregates) before being added to microglial cultures. sAβ was initially diluted in water while vortexing, mixed well, then further diluted in labeling medium (serum-free DMEM medium, buffered with 20 mm HEPES to pH 7.4, and containing 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Sigma)). Aβ peptides were allowed to microaggregate for 2 h at 37 °C before being added to microglial cultures. fAβ microaggregates were prepared as above, and then incubated with different amounts of an Aβ-specific monoclonal antibody, 4G8, or an isotype control antibody, for 2 h at 37 °C. 4G8 recognizes residues 17–24 of Aβ. IgG-fAβ microaggregates were sedimented in an Ultracentrifuge at 100,000 × g for 2 h. To prepare C1q-fAβ microaggregates, IgG-fAβ microaggregates were incubated for a further 2 h at 37 °C with FBS (10%). C1q-fAβ microaggregates were sedimented in an ultracentrifuge at 100,000 × g for 2 h. All labeling was done at 37 °C. Cells were first rinsed twice with dye-free labeling medium. Labeled-fAβ or IgG-fAβ in labeling medium was then added to the medium for 10 min at 37 °C. This was followed by rinsing and fixation with 3% paraformaldehyde freshly diluted in phosphate-buffered saline. Microaggregates were centrifuged at 100,000×g, for 2 h, at 4 °C. They were washed, taken up in loading buffer (containing 2% SDS and 5% β2-mercaptoethanol), and boiled for 6 min before loading on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (46.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose filters (Bio-Rad), which were then blocked (5% milk powder) for 1 h. To detect 4G8, the membrane was incubated with rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody for 1 h, washed, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked rabbit antibodies to mouse IgG for 2 h, washed again, and developed using the ECL system (Amersham, UK). To detect C1q, the membrane was incubated for 2 h with antibody RMC7H8, which recognizes C1q (Cedarlane), washed, incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked donkey antibodies to rat IgG for 2 h, washed again, and developed using the ECL system. All washes were done 5 times for 10 min each. Fluorescence microscopy and digital image collection were performed using a Leica fluorescence microscope equipped with a Photometrics (Tucson, AZ) cooled charge-coupled device camera as described previously (47.Mayor S. Presley J.F. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1257-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Fluorescence quantification was carried out on this widefield microscope with a 25× magnification objective to obtain a large number of cells per field. Images for qualitative purposes were obtained at a higher magnification (63×, numerical aperture 1.4 objective) as described previously (48.Mayor S. Maxfield F.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 6: 929-944Crossref Scopus (250) Google Scholar). Fields used for quantification were selected at random throughout the dish and focused using phase-contrast optics before viewing the fluorescence. Digital fluorescence images were obtained, and background signal was removed from the images as described previously (49.Dunn K.W. McGraw T.E. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3303-3314Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Objects of the size of cells and above the threshold intensity were identified using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging, West Chester, PA). Total fluorescence intensity was taken as the sum of all intensity in these objects, which was then divided by the number of cells in the field to calculate the average fluorescent intensity per cell. Cells were grown in 24-well plates for 1–2 days before the start of the experiment. 125I-fAβ was prepared using the chloramine-T method (42.Paresce D.M. Chung H. Maxfield F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29390-29397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 50.Yamashiro D.J. Borden L.A. Maxfield F.R. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 139: 377-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The cells were washed twice with labeling medium and then incubated with the radiolabeled Aβ42 peptides for 1 h at 37 °C in a 5% CO2-humidified air atmosphere. The cells were rinsed three times with labeling medium and then incubated at 37 °C for 15 min to allow the release of nonspecifically bound Aβ. The cells were rinsed further, twice with serum-free medium and three times with chase medium, which was the microglia growth medium, and then incubated with 1 ml of chase medium for varying times. At the end of the chase, the medium was removed, and the radioactivity in the medium was measured. The cells were rinsed and solubilized with 1 m NaOH. The chase medium was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid on ice for 1 h and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min to separate the trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction from the trichloroacetic acid-insoluble fraction. Where indicated, the excess unlabeled ligands were added to the incubation medium along with the radiolabeled peptides and were maintained in the labeling medium for the entire incubation. The radioactivity of these background dishes was subtracted from the values for the control experiments. All radioactive experiments were conducted with three wells per condition and repeated at least three times on separate days. Fluorescence images were obtained with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser-scanning confocal microscope equipped with a 63×, NA 1.4 plan Apochromat objective (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Jena, Germany). Red and green images were acquired sequentially using the 543-nm (exciting Cy3) and 488 nm (exciting fluorescein/Alexa488) lines from a 1-milliwatt HeNe laser and a 25-milliwatt argon laser, respectively. Fluorescently labeled Cy3-fAβ microaggregates were modified with 4G8, an anti-β-amyloid antibody by incubation with the antibody (0–10 μg/ml) for 2 h at 37 °C. To confirm the presence of the antibody in the modified fAβ microaggregates (IgG-fAβ), Western blotting was performed. Fig.1 A shows that 4G8 is bound to fAβ. The binding of 4G8 to fAβ becomes saturated at a concentration of 1 μg/ml. Specific binding was confirmed by using an isotype matched control antibody. This antibody does not bind to fAβ microaggregates. Binding of C1q to IgG is the first step in the classical pathway of the complement cascade that leads to complement activation. Because C1q is found in AD brains and is reported to bind directly to human Aβ (51.Jiang H. Burdick D. Glabe C.G. Cotman C.W. Tenner A.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 5050-5059PubMed Google Scholar), we were interested to see whether C1q modified fAβ would be internalized by microglia. We found that murine or bovine C1q did not bind directly to fAβ; therefore, we utilized the anti-Aβ antibody, 4G8, as an indirect way to couple fAβ and C1q. We prepared C1q-modified microaggregates of fAβ (C1q-fAβ) by incubating IgG-fAβ with 10% FBS. To confirm the presence of C1q in the C1q-fAβ microaggregates, Western blotting was performed. Fig. 1B shows the presence of C1q bound to IgG-fAβ after 2 h of incubation with FBS. The maximum amount of C1q is bound when the saturating concentration of 1 μg/ml 4G8 is used. To determine whether microglia take up the modified microaggregates, cells were pulsed with Cy3-fAβ or Cy3-IgG-fAβ or microaggregates for 10 min, washed, and then fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde. Images were acquired on a confocal microscope and single optical sections are shown (Fig. 2). IgG-fAβ microaggregates are internalized by microglia (Fig. 2 B), and the intensity of uptake of the modified microaggregates appears greater than that of unmodified Aβ microaggregates (compare Figs. 2 A and2 B). Quantification of the uptake of IgG-fAβ compared with fAβ is shown in Fig. 2 C. Internalization of IgG-fAβ by microglia increases as binding of 4G8 increases until a plateau is reached at a concentration of 1 μg/ml 4G8. At 5 and 10 μg/ml 4G8, there is no further increase in uptake. At saturating concentration of 4G8 (1 μg/ml), internalization of IgG-fAβ is about 1.5-fold greater than that of unmodified fAβ microaggregates (p < 0.01). There is no change in uptake of fAβ microaggregates preincubated with isotype control IgG at a concentration of 10 μg/ml (data not shown). Microglia were also pulsed with Cy3-C1q-fAβ, prepared with 1 μg/ml 4G8 and 10% FBS. Cy3-C1q-fAβ microaggregates are internalized by microglia, and quantification of these experiments reveals that uptake of Cy3-C1q-fAβ is also increased about 1.5-fold compared with Cy3-fAβ (data not shown). We were interested to see whether the"

The molecular basis for the transport of rat ethanol-inducible cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) to the plasma membrane was investigated by transfection of several different mutant cDNAs into mouse H2.35 hepatoma cells. Two NH2-terminal CYP2E1 mutants were constructed: N++2E1, which carried two positive charges in the NH2 terminus, and 2C-2E1, in which the transmembrane domain of CYP2E1 was replaced with that of CYP2C1, which was previously described to cause retention of CYP2C1 in the endoplasmic reticulum, as well as CYP2E1 COOH-terminally tagged with the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) epitope (2E1-VSV-G). Immunofluorescent microscopy and cell surface biotinylation experiments revealed that all CYP2E1 variants were present on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane. The VSV-G epitope on CYP2E1 was detected on the outside of the plasma membrane using VSV-G-specific antibodies, indicating that the large COOH-terminal part of CYP2E1 is indeed exposed on the outside of the plasma membrane. The relative levels of CYP2E1, 2C-2E1, and 2E1-VSV-G on the cell surface were found to be about 2% of total cellular enzyme, whereas twice this amount of N++2E1 was recovered at the cell surface. Protease protection experiments performed on microsomes isolated from cDNA transfected cells revealed that a small fraction of CYP2E1 and all variant proteins was found to be located in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (type II orientation), whereas the majority of the proteins were in the expected cytosolic or type I orientation. It is concluded that the NH2-terminal transmembrane domain of CYP2E1 plays a critical role in directing the protein to the cell surface and that topological inversion of a small fraction of CYP2E1 in the endoplasmic reticulum directs the protein to the plasma membrane.

It is concluded that the NH2-terminal transmembrane domain of CYP2E1 plays a critical role in directing the protein to the cell surface and that topological inversion of a small fraction of CYP2E1 in the endoplasmic reticulum directs the protein to the plasma membrane. cytochrome P450 plasma membrane endoplasmic reticulum NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase phosphate-buffered saline vesicular stomatitis virus G protein polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis wild-type Hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450s (P450s)1 are a large superfamily of enzymes that are known to metabolize a wide variety of both endogenous and exogenous compounds (1.Nelson D.R.

The majority of the P450 enzymes are membrane-bound, predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane by its hydrophobic NH2terminus (3.Bar-Nun S. Kreibich G. Adesnik M. Alterman L.

EMBO J. 1987; 6: 2425-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), leaving the majority of the protein, including the catalytic domain, exposed on the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane. The hydrophobic NH2 terminus of P450 not only is responsible for targeting to and insertion in the ER but also has been shown to cause retention of the protein in the ER (7.Ahn K. Szczesna-Skorupa E.

The precise mechanism by which the NH2 terminus of P450s mediates ER retention is not clear, yet there are no known ER retention or retrieval signals present in the sequence. It has been shown that P450 can form oligomeric complexes (9.Myasoedova K.N. Berndt P. FEBS Lett. 1990; 275: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 10.Schwarz D. Pirrwitz J. Meyer H.W.

Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Cytochrome P450 Structure, Mechanisms and Biochemistry. Plenum Press, New York1986: 119-160Google Scholar). It could be hypothesized that the formation of oligomeric protein complexes causes retention in the ER by excluding them from the export complexes, as has been demonstrated for proteins residing in the Golgi apparatus (12.Munro S. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 11-15Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). However, based on the mobility of CYP2C2 in the ER membrane as determined by photobleaching/fluorescence recovery, this seems to be less probable (13.Szczesna-Skorupa E. Chen C.D. Rogers S. Kemper B.

Immunofluorescent microscopy has indicated that several different P450 enzymes are present on the outer surface of hepatocytes isolated from human and rat liver (19.Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 1992; 15: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 20.Loeper J. Descatoire V. Maurice M. Beaune P. Feldmann G. Larrey D. Pessayre D.

In addition, it was shown that CYP2E1 and CYP2D6 are catalytically active in purified plasma membranes isolated from respectively rat liver hepatocytes and Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing CYP2D6 cDNA (19.Wu D. Cederbaum A.I. Hepatology. 1992; 15: 515-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 23.Loeper J. Louerat-Oriou B. Duport C. Pompon D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The involvement of the constitutive secretory pathway in the transport to the PM has been suggested. Several forms of P450 have been shown to be present in Golgi apparatus isolated from rat liver (17.Neve E.P.A. Eliasson E. Pronzato M.A. Albano E. Marinari U. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and Golgi transport inhibitors were shown to decrease the expression of CYP2B on the PM of rat hepatocytes (24.Robin M.A. Maratrat M.

P450s localized at the cell surface have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several forms of drug-induced autoimmune hepatitis, and it is likely that PM expressed P450s play a role in the hepatotoxicity associated with this disease (25.Pirmohamed M. Park B.K. Ioannides C. Cytochromes P450 Metabolic and Toxicological Aspects. CRC Press, New York1996: 329-354Google Scholar, 26.Beaune P. Pessayre D. Dansette P. Mansuy D. Manns M. Adv. Pharmacol. 1994; 30: 199-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Patients suffering from drug-induced hepatitis were shown to have high levels of autoantibodies directed against certain forms of P450 in their blood (27.Bourdi M. Larrey D. Nataf J. Bernuau J.

Until now, much research has been focused on the identification of the epitopes present on P450s that are recognized by these autoantibodies, and many of these epitopes have been mapped around the catalytic site of P450 (29.Belloc C. Gauffre A. Andre C. Beaune P.H. Pharmacogenetics. 1997; 7: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30.Lecoeur S. Andre C. Beaune P.H. Mol.

Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism responsible for the appearance of P450 on the surface of the PM remains unknown. One puzzling aspect is the appearance of P450 on the outer surface of the PM, whereas it displays a cytoplasmic or type I (Ccyt/Nexo) orientation in the ER. In a recent investigation, topologically inverted CYP2D6 was expressed inS. cerevisiae, and it was concluded that topological inversion in the ER membrane was not responsible for directing CYP2D6 to the PM (32.Loeper J. Le Berre A. Pompon D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). CYP2E1 plays an important role in the gluconeogenesis, especially during fasting (33.Bondoc F.Y.

Johansson I. Yin H. Terelius Y. Eliasson E. Clot P. Albano E. Alcohol. 1993; 10: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Autoantibodies against both the native CYP2E1 and CYP2E1 hydroxyethyl radical adducts have been observed among alcoholic patients (31.Lytton S.D. Helander A. Zhang-Gouillon Z.Q. Stokkeland K.

Israel Y. Moncada C. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Gastroenterology. 1996; 111: 206-216Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In the present investigation, the role of the NH2-terminal transmembrane domain of CYP2E1 for the transport from the ER to the outer surface of the PM was evaluated by monitoring the presence of the protein and NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal mutants thereof in the ER and plasma membrane utilizing immunofluorescent microscopy, cell surface biotinylation, and protease protection experiments. It is concluded that the COOH-terminal part of CYP2E1 is localized on the outside of the PM and that the molecular mechanism underlying the transport of CYP2E1 to the PM involves the incorporation of a small fraction of CYP2E1 during translation in a lumenal or type II (Cexo/Ncyt) orientation in the ER membrane. Full-length rat CYP2E1 cDNA (wt2E1) and N++2E1, having A2K and V3R substitutions, were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pCMV5 as described (15.Neve E.P.A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The construct 2E1-VSV-G was formed by the introduction of the 11-amino acid epitope derived from the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-G) to CYP2E1. 2E1-VSV-G was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), the forward primer 1a, and the reverse primer 2a (TableI), containing the coding sequence for the VSV-G tag. The resulting 2E1-VSV-G cDNA was cloned between theEcoRI and XbaI sites of the pCMV5 expression vector. A chimeric construct in which the 31 NH2-terminal amino acids of CYP2E1 were replaced by the 28 NH2-terminal amino acids from rabbit CYP2C1 was constructed as follows. The cDNA of the NH2 terminus of CYP2C1 was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification using rabbit liver cDNA (kindly provided by Dr. S. Svensson, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden), the forward primer 1b, and the reverse primer 2b, starting 390 base pairs upstream of the initiation codon. The resulting truncated CYP2C1 cDNA was cloned in between restriction sites EcoRI andXbaI of pCMV5. The pCMV-CYP2C1 plasmid was digested withHindIII and XbaI, leaving the coding sequence for the first 28 amino acids of CYP2C1 in the plasmid. The cDNA of CYP2E1, lacking the coding region for amino acids 1–31 and containing a HindIII site at the 5′end, was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification using the forward primer 1c and the reverse primer 2c. The resulting cDNA was ligated in between theHindIII and XbaI sites of the restricted pCMV-CYP2C1 plasmid, thereby generating the 2C-2E1 chimera. The correct DNA sequence of all inserts was confirmed by DNA sequencing using the ABI PRISM® dye terminator cycle sequencing kit from Perkin-Elmer.Table ISequences of the oligonucleotides used as polymerase chain reaction primersPrimerSequence (5′ to 3′)Primer 1aGAC GAA TTC ATG GCG GTT CTT GGC ATCPrimer 1bGAC GAA TTC ATG GAT CCT GTG GTG GTG CTG GGGPrimer 1cCTC AAG CTT CCC CCA GGA CCT TTC CCTPrimer 2aGAT TCT AGA TCA CTT GCG CAG CCT ATT CAT CTC TAT ATC GGT GTA AAT TGA ACG GGG AAT GAC ACA GAGPrimer 2bGAC TCT AGA GGT CAT GAG CGA GAA GCG CCG GGTPrimer 2cGAC TCT AGA TCA TGA ACG GGG AAT GACThe coding sequence for the VSV-G epitope is underlined, and the restriction sites are depicted in italics.

H2.35 cells, mouse SV-40 transformed hepatocytes, were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and grown and transfected with the cationic lipid DMRIE-C (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described previously (15.Neve E.P.A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk and incubated with the appropriate antibodies as described previously (17.Neve E.P.A. Eliasson E. Pronzato M.A. Albano E. Marinari U. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Pierce). Cells grown and transfected on glass coverslips were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), fixed in 2% formaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, and either permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 or not permeabilized. After blocking in 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS for 2.5 h, primary antibodies were incubated in the presence of 3% bovine serum albumin (w/v) in PBS for 90 min followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:500 dilution) in the presence of 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 90 min. Stained cells were carefully mounted with a drop of Vecta-Shield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) on a glass slide. The glass slides were viewed under an Olympus BX60 microscope equipped with an Olympus PM20 camera (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). The catalytic activity of the CYP2E1 variants was determined by monitoring the hydroxylation of chlorzoxazone in the microsomal fractions isolated from transfected H2.35 cells essentially as described before (17.Neve E.P.A. Eliasson E. Pronzato M.A. Albano E. Marinari U. Ingelman-Sundberg M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 333: 459-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) with some modifications. The microsomes were diluted with 50 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7.4, to a protein concentration of 0.2 mg/ml and were incubated in the presence of 0.5 mm chlorzoxazone in the presence or absence of a NADPH generating system (0.2 mm NADPH, 2.0 mm glucose-6-phosphate and 3 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase). After 10 min, the reaction was terminated by the addition of orthophosphoric acid, an internal standard (0.04 μg of acetaminophen) was added, and the samples were extracted twice with 1 ml of dichloromethane. The organic phases were collected and evaporated under a nitrogen flow, and the remaining residue was dissolved into 100 μl of mobile phase. The samples were analyzed on a LKB 2150 high pressure liquid chromatography system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a LiChrospher®100 RP-8 prepacked column (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and the mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile:0.5% orthophosphoric acid (0.25:0.75) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Both the product 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone and the internal standard were detected using a LC-4C amperometric detector (Bioanalytical Systems, West Lafayette, IN) with a potential of 0.9 V over the electrochemical cell. H2.35 cells were transfected in 35-mm dishes, and 30 h posttransfection, the cells were biotinylated. Dishes containing the transfected cells were transferred to ice and washed twice with ice-cold PBS. The biotinylation reaction was carried out on ice by incubating the cells with 35 μl of the ECL protein biotinylation reagent biotinamidocaproateN-hydroxysuccinamide ester (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) per ml of PBS under gentle shaking. After 30 min, the biotinylation reagent was removed, and cells were washed three times with 50 mmglycine in PBS to quench the remaining reagent and solubilized in 1.3 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 250 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml antipain, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The biotinylated proteins were recovered from the precleared cell lysate by incubation with streptavidin-agarose beads (50 μl of swollen gel) in a vertical rotating platform for 2 h. After washing of the streptavidin-agarose beads, three times with lysis buffer and twice with PBS, the biotinylated proteins were eluted by boiling the beads in 100 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and the eluted proteins were analyzed by Western blotting. Protein levels were quantified by densitometric analysis on a personal densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The membrane topology of the CYP2E1 variants in the ER was determined by a protease protection assay as described (15.Neve E.P.A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells transfected with the CYP2E1 variants were harvested and homogenized in microsome isolation buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, containing 0.25 m sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) by Dounce homogenization. After removal of the nuclear and mitochondrial fractions, the microsomal fraction was isolated by ultracentrifugation (60 min at 100,000 × g). The microsomal fraction was diluted with 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, containing 10 mm CaCl2 and 150 mm NaCl to a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml. The samples were incubated with proteinase K (83 μg/ml) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the presence or absence of 0.5% Triton X-100 at 37 °C. After 30 min, the reaction was stopped by the addition of an equal volume of ice-cold 50% trichloroacetic acid, and proteins were allowed to precipitate on ice for 30 min. The precipitated proteins were centrifuged down, washed with ice-cold acetone, dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and analyzed by Western blotting. The mammalian expression vector pCMV-5 containing mutant cDNAs encoding the CYP2E1 variants was transiently expressed in a mouse hepatoma cell line, H2.35 cells. The constructs made were as follows (Fig. 1): (i) N++2E1, which contains two positively charged amino acid residues in the NH2 terminus, a modification that was demonstrated in CYP2D6 and CYP2C11 to result in lumenal or type II topology in the ER membrane in COS cells (32.Loeper J. Le Berre A. Pompon D. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 37.Sato T. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Omura T. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2391-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); (ii) 2C-2E1, in which the NH2-terminal transmembrane domain of CYP2E1 had been replaced with that of CYP2C1, which previously has been shown to be sufficient for retention of CYP2C1 in the ER membrane in COS cells (7.Ahn K. Szczesna-Skorupa E. Kemper B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 18726-18733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and (iii) 2E1-VSV-G, CYP2E1 COOH-terminally tagged with the epitope from VSV-G in order to determine the localization of the COOH terminus using antibodies directed toward the VSV-G tag. The intracellular distribution of the various CYP2E1 proteins expressed was determined by immunofluorescent microscopy performed on fixed permeabilized cells stained with CYP2E1-specific antibodies (Fig.2). wt2E1 (Fig. 2 B) and N++2E1 (Fig. 2 D) were predominantly localized in the ER, whereas cells transfected with empty plasmid (Fig.2 A) contained no significant levels of CYP2E1 (15.Neve E.P.A. Ingelman-Sundberg M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 460: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The other two CYP2E1 variants, 2C-2E1 (Fig. 2 C) and 2E1-VSV-G (Fig. 2 E), exhibited the same intracellular distribution as wt2E1, indicative of their ER localization. Analysis by Western blotting of microsomes isolated from cells transfected with these CYP2E1 variants revealed that all of them were expressed at their correct size (data not shown). When permeabilized cells expressing 2E1-VSV-G were stained with antibodies specifically recognizing the VSV-G tag, a staining pattern identical to that seen in Fig.2 E was observed (not shown).Figure 2The intracellular distribution of wt2E1, 2C-2E1, N++2E1, and 2E1-VSV-G as determined by immunofluorescent microscopy. H2.35 cells were transfected with empty plasmid (A), wt2E1 (B), 2C-2E1 (C), N++2E1 (D), and 2E1-VSV-G (E), fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with CYP2E1-specific antibodies (1:5000 dilution), followed by anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies (1:500 dilution).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The catalytic activity of CYP2E1 and its variants was determined by measuring the NADPH-supported formation of 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone in microsomes isolated from the transfected cells. Fig.3 shows that CYP2E1 and all the CYP2E1 variants displayed similar catalytic activities. The fact that all CYP2E1 variants were catalytically active indicated that they were correctly folded and incorporated into the ER membrane and were able to interact with NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase. Cells transfected with empty plasmid displayed no significant formation of 6-hydroxychlorzoxazone (not shown), indicating no endogenous CYP2E1 in these cells. The distribution of wt2E1 and the CYP2E1 variants on the outside of the PM was also studied by immunofluorescent microscopy performed on fixed nonpermeabilized cells. Fig. 4 shows transfected H2.35 cells stained with CYP2E1-specific antibodies. wt2E1 (Fig. 4 B), 2C-2E1 (Fig. 4 C), N++2E1 (Fig. 4 D), and 2E1-VSV-G (Fig. 4 E) all displayed a weak but significant cell surface staining, which was absent in cells transfected with empty plasmid (Fig. 4 A). Typically, the staining pattern observed was not uniformly distributed over the entire surface of the cell but appeared as discrete patches on the cell surface. The extracellular localization of CYP2E1 was further confirmed by using the COOH-terminally VSV-G-tagged form of CYP2E1. When nonpermeabilized cells transfected with 2E1-VSV-G were stained with antibodies specifically recognizing the VSV-G epitope, a staining pattern identical to that seen with CYP2E1-specific antibodies was observed (cf. Fig.5 B and Fig. 4 E). Again, no staining was observed in cells transfected with the empty plasmid (Fig. 5 A). This clearly demonstrated that the COOH-terminal part of the CYP2E1 protein is located on the outer surface of the PM and that the COOH terminus of CYP2E1 is exposed at the surface of the protein.Figure 5The COOH terminus of CYP2E1 is exposed on the outside of the plasma membrane. H2.35 cells were transfected with empty plasmid (A) and 2E1-VSV-G (B), fixed, and incubated with antibodies specifically recognizing the VSV-G epitope (1:1000 dilution), followed by anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies (1:500 dilution).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To study the expression of CYP2E1 on the outer surface of the PM in a more quantitative manner, a protein biotinylation method was developed. After transfection, cells were either permeabilized, to permit biotinylation of total cellular protein, or not permeabilized, to enable it to biotinylate cell surface proteins only. Fig.6 A shows biotinylated proteins isolated from permeabilized (lanes 1) and nonpermeabilized (lanes 2) H2.35 cells expressing wt2E1. The isolated biotinylated proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis for CYP2E1 and the ER resident proteins reductase and calnexin. Only CYP2E1 was detected on the cell surface (lanes 2), whereas reductase and calnexin were absent. These results revealed not only that reductase and calnexin were absent from the outside of the PM but also that there was no significant contamination from intracellular proteins. CYP2E1 present at the cell surface was shown to have an electrophoretic mobility on SDS-PAGE similar to that of CYP2E1 detected in the microsomal fraction isolated from transfecte"
https://openalex.org/W2115177619,"Synaptic vesicle protein 2 (SV2) is a component of all synaptic vesicles that is required for normal neurotransmission. Here we report that in intact synaptic terminals SV2 is a phosphoprotein. Phosphopeptide mapping studies indicate that a major site of phosphorylation is located on the cytoplasmic amino terminus. SV2 is phosphorylated on serine and threonine but not on tyrosine residues, indicating that it is a substrate for serine/threonine kinases. Phosphopeptide mapping, in gel kinase assays, and surveys of kinase inhibitors suggest that casein kinase I is a primary SV2 kinase. The amino terminus of SV2 was previously shown to mediate its interaction with synaptotagmin, a calcium-binding protein also required for normal neurotransmission. Comparison of synaptotagmin binding with phosphorylated and unphosphorylated SV2 amino-terminal peptides reveals an increase in binding with phosphorylation. These results suggest that the affinity of SV2 for synaptotagmin is modulated by phosphorylation of SV2. Synaptic vesicle protein 2 (SV2) is a component of all synaptic vesicles that is required for normal neurotransmission. Here we report that in intact synaptic terminals SV2 is a phosphoprotein. Phosphopeptide mapping studies indicate that a major site of phosphorylation is located on the cytoplasmic amino terminus. SV2 is phosphorylated on serine and threonine but not on tyrosine residues, indicating that it is a substrate for serine/threonine kinases.

Many stages of this cycle, such as the targeting and docking of vesicles at active zone membranes, vesicle fusion, and endocytosis, are mediated by the formation of protein complexes (reviewed in Refs. 1.Bajjalieh S.M. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1999; 9: 321-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar and 2.Jahn R. Sudhof T.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 863-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1014) Google Scholar). Protein phosphorylation, a ubiquitous mechanism of cellular regulation, plays an important role in the modulation of the synaptic vesicle cycle. Multiple examples of phosphorylation-mediated regulation of protein binding in the synapse have been reported. One well characterized example is the phosphorylation-dependent association of the actin-binding protein synapsin with synaptic vesicles, an interaction implicated in the maintenance of a reserve pool of vesicles (3.Greengard P.

Likewise, proteins involved in the docking and fusion of vesicles, termed SNAREs,1 are substrates of several protein kinases, and phosphorylation has been reported to alter their binding to other proteins and to each other (5.Hirling H.

Loss of the most widely expressed isoform, SV2A, results in aberrant neurotransmission and death, indicating that SV2 is an essential protein (11.Crowder K.M. Gunther J.M. Jones T.A. Hale B.D. Zhang H.-Z. Peterson M.R. Scheller R.H. Chavkin C. Bajjalieh S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 115268-115273Google Scholar, 12.Janz R. Goda Y. Geppert M. Missler M. Sudhof T.C.

We previously reported that SV2A interacts with the synaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin, a calcium-binding protein that is necessary for normal calcium-stimulated neurotransmission (19.Schivell A.E. Batchelor R.H. Bajjalieh S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27770-27775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The SV2-synaptotagmin interaction is modulated by calcium, suggesting that it plays a role in the regulation of exocytosis. The amino terminus of SV2, which mediates its interaction with synaptotagmin, contains substrate consensus sites of several protein kinases. In addition, SV2 was previously reported to be phosphorylatedin vitro under conditions permissive to casein kinase I activity (20.Gross S.D. Hoffman D.P. Fisette P.L. Baas P. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether SV2 is phosphorylatedin vivo and whether phosphorylation regulates its action, we examined SV2 phosphorylation in intact nerve terminals and in synaptic vesicles. We report that SV2 is a phosphoprotein in the synapse, that it is phosphorylated on its amino terminus, and that phosphorylation increases the binding of SV2 to synaptotagmin. These results suggest that the SV2-synaptotagmin interaction is regulated by changes in SV2 phosphorylation levels. Radiolabeled orthophosphate and adenosine triphosphate were purchased from NEN Life Science Products, protein A-Sepharose was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, glutathione-agarose was from Sigma, and recombinant rat casein kinase I was from Calbiochem. Sequencing grade trypsin was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI), and Ni2+-NTA-agarose was from Qiagen. cAMP-dependent protein kinase was kindly provided by Dr. Brian Murphy (University of Washington, Seattle, WA). Crude synaptosomes and synaptic vesicles were prepared as described by Huttner et al. (21.Huttner W.B. Schiebler P. Greengard P. DeCammilli P. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1373-1388Crossref Scopus (888) Google Scholar). Briefly, fresh rat brains were homogenized in buffered sucrose (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.3m sucrose) with 10 strokes in a glass-Teflon homogenizer (0.004–0.006-inch clearance). Homogenates were centrifuged at 1000 × g to remove nuclei and intact cells. Crude synaptosomes were recovered from the remaining supernatant by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 13 min. The protein concentration of resuspended synaptosomes was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as a standard. To obtain a crude synaptic vesicle preparation, synaptosomes were washed, resuspended in HBS (142 mm NaCl, 2.4 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mmd-glucose), and then hypotonically lysed by diluting 1:9 with water, rehomogenizing, and incubating for 30 min on ice. Heavy membranes were removed by centrifugation in a Beckman SW28 rotor at 15,000 rpm for 16 min. The resulting supernatant was centrifuged in the same rotor at 28,000 rpm for 4 h to isolate crude synaptic vesicles. Vesicles were resuspended in 1.1× HK buffer (22 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 154 mm KCH3CO2). Synaptosomes (2 mg of protein/ml) were resuspended in labeling buffer (140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) containing 1 mCi [γ-32P]PO4/ml for 1 h at 37 °C. A separate reaction lacking 32PO4 was incubated for subsequent immunoblotting. Labeled synaptosomes were isolated by centrifugation at 19,000 × g for 5 min and resuspended in extraction buffer (HKA (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 140 mm KCH3CO2, 1 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA) with 2% Triton X-100, 50 mm NaF. This was extracted overnight at 4 °C. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 19,000 × gfor 15 min. Extracts were precleared of proteins that bind Protein A nonspecifically by incubation with Protein A-Sepharose beads in 1× HKA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% gelatin. Extracts were then incubated with anti-SV2 monoclonal antibody (9.Buckley K. Kelly R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 100: 1284-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar) for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads were added, and the mixture was incubated for an additional 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed twice in 1× HKA, 0.1% gelatin and once in 1× HKA and then incubated with SDS-PAGE loading buffer for at least 10 min at 65 °C to elute bound proteins. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were either dried and exposed to film or transferred to nitrocellulose for immunoblotting. SV2 was phosphorylated in reactions containing approximately 1 mg/ml crude synaptic vesicle protein in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 140 mm KOAc, 10 mm magnesium acetate, and 33 nm[γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C and then quenched with the addition of chilled extraction buffer with a phosphatase inhibitor mixture (1 mm EDTA, 11 mm EGTA, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 20 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 0.15 mm sodium vanadate). Reactions were extracted at 4 °C from 2 h to overnight. Immunoprecipitations were performed as described above with either a monoclonal antibody directed against all SV2 isoforms or a polyclonal antibody specific to SV2A. Phosphorylated glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion peptides containing the amino terminus of SV2A or SV2B (GST-AN or GST-BN) were generated in 100-μl reactions containing 2 μg of recombinant peptide and 1.0 mg/ml crude synaptic vesicle protein in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 140 mm KOAc, 10 mmMg(CH3CO2)2, and 33 nm[γ-32P]ATP. At the end of a 15-min incubation at 30 °C, insoluble protein was removed by centrifugation for 1 min at 19,000 × g. Reactions were quenched by the addition of 800 μl of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20 and phosphatase inhibitor mixture. Phospho-GST-AN and GST-BN were re-isolated by incubation with glutathione-agarose beads precoated with 0.1% gelatin and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Beads were washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween 20. Peptides were eluted with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were stained with Coomassie Blue and dried. Phosphoproteins were located by autoradiography, and bands of interest were excised and rehydrated in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate containing 1.2–2.0 μg of trypsin at 37 °C for 18 h, during which additional 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate was added to keep gel slices submerged. The eluate was transferred to a new tube and dried while the gel slices were incubated with additional 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate for 2 h at 37 °C. All eluates were pooled and dried. Peptides were washed five times with 100–200 μl of water and suspended in pH 4.72 buffer (5%n-butanol, 2.5% pyridine, 2.5% glacial acetic acid) containing a trace amount of phenol red. Samples were spotted onto cellulose plates and run 10 cm at 400 V. Plates were dried overnight and subjected to chromatography at 90° to the electrophoretic direction in 6% glacial acetic acid, 34% n-butanol, 26% pyridine, 34% water. Plates were dried and exposed to film. Two micrograms of GST or GST-AN fusion peptide were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in 50-μl reactions containing 100 μg of synaptic vesicle protein, 10mm Hepes, pH7.5, 140mm KCH3CO2, 0.1 mmEGTA, 20 mm magnesium acetate, and 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Peptides were purified using glutathione-agarose and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Gels were dried and exposed to film. Phosphoamino acid analysis was carried out as described by Kamps and Sefton (22.Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) on radiolabeled SV2 isolated by immunoprecipitation. Samples were resolved by thin layer chromatography in two dimensions. In the first dimension, pH 1.9 buffer was allowed to migrate 12 cm up the plate. The second dimension (run at 90° to the first) was resolved in pH 3.5 buffer (1% pyridine, 10% glacial acetic acid) for 6 cm. Standards were stained with 0.2% ninhydrin in acetone before the plates were subjected to autoradiography. This assay was based on a protocol developed by Stratagene. 10% SDS-PAGE gels were poured with and without 0.375 mg/ml GST-AN added to the gel matrix. 0.5 μg of crude synaptic vesicle protein was resolved in each gel lane. Gels were washed twice for 15 min each in buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) with 20% isopropyl alcohol and equilibrated in buffer A for 1 h. Proteins were denatured by incubating gels in buffer A with 6 n guanidine-HCl for 2 h with two buffer changes. Proteins were renatured by two 8-h incubations in buffer A with 0.05% Tween 20. Gels were then equilibrated in kinase assay buffer (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 90 μm sodium vanadate, 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) for 30 min. Proteins were phosphorylated in gel by incubating the gels in kinase assay buffer with 30 mm MgATP, 6 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP for 1 h. Reactions were quenched by washing the gels five times for 20 min each in 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, 1% (w/v) sodium pyrophosphate. Gels were dried and exposed to film. cDNAs encoding the amino-terminal region of SV2A (amino acids 1–183) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and subcloned into the pTrcHisC expression vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). Protein was produced inEscherichia coli strain BL26 and isolated by Ni2+-NTA-agarose chromatography. 75 μg of crude synaptic vesicle protein was incubated for 15 min at 30 °C in 50-μl reactions containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 140 mm potassium acetate, 10 mm magnesium chloride, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 5 μl of Me2SO with 0–1 mm CKI-7. Proteins were then extracted by the addition of 18 volumes of 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 140 mm potassium acetate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, and 2% Triton X-100 followed by incubation with gentle agitation for 2 h. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 19,000 × g for 15 min. SV2 was immunoprecipitated from the resulting supernatants. Immunoprecipitated protein was resolved by SDS-PAGE and subjected to autoradiography and Western analysis to measure incorporation of phosphate and the amount of SV2 precipitated, respectively. Approximately 20 μg of His-AN fusion protein was phosphorylated in 450-μl reactions containing 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and 500 units of recombinant casein kinase I (Calbiochem). MgATP was added to 1 mm, and the incubation was carried out at 30 °C for 1 h. A parallel reaction was carried out without kinase as a control. His-AN was purified from these reactions with Ni2+-NTA resin. 500 μl of wash buffer (50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl) and 500 μl of 50% Ni2+-NTA resin were added to each reaction, after which they were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with agitation. Resin was washed twice with 500 μl of wash buffer and once with 500 μl of wash buffer with 20 mm imidazole. Peptide was eluted into 200 μl of wash buffer containing 500 mm imidazole and quantified by comparison with bovine serum albumin standards in SDS-PAGE gels stained with Coomassie Blue. Equal amounts of phosphorylated or unphosphorylated His-AN were incubated with 0.5–1 μg of GST or GST-synaptotagmin bound to 30 μl of 50% glutathione-agarose beads in 1 ml of HEDTA buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mmHEDTA, 95 mm KCH3CO2, 1% Triton) for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads were washed three times with 1 ml of HEDTA buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with 10 μl of 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 15 mm glutathione. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE. Gels were transferred to nitrocellulose and subjected to Western analysis. The amino acid sequences of all three SV2 proteins predict two major cytoplasmic domains, the amino terminus and the loop between the sixth and seventh transmembrane domains (13.Bajjalieh S.M.

These cytoplasmic domains contain the substrate consensus sequences (23.Kemp B.E. Pearson R.B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 342-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar, 24.Kennelly P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15555-15558Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) of several protein kinases reported to be present in the nerve terminal. These include casein kinase I (CKI), casein kinase II, protein kinase C, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). To determine whether SV2 is a phosphoprotein in situ, synaptosomes (intact synaptic terminals) were incubated with [32P]orthophosphate in order to radiolabel synaptic nucleotide pools. After labeling, SV2 was extracted and isolated by immunoprecipitation using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes all known SV2 isoforms. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and phosphoproteins were detected by autoradiography. A phosphoprotein of the appropriate size was isolated, suggesting that SV2 is a phosphoprotein in the synapse (Fig.1 A). An estimate of the stoichiometry of phosphorylation was precluded by the fact that SV2 does not label with standard protein staining techniques and therefore SV2 content in a sample cannot be measured. However, even though we were unable to estimate what the proportion of SV2 phosphorylated in nerve terminals, the observation that measurable levels of phospho-SV2 were obtained with a 30-min labeling incubation is consistent with a significant proportion of the protein cycling into a phosphorylated state. To confirm that the immunoprecipitated protein was SV2, immunoprecipitates isolated from parallel, unlabeled incubations were subjected to Western analysis using a polyclonal antibody specific to SV2A, which is predicted to be the largest of the three SV2 isoforms. Anti-SV2A recognized a band that ran as a higher molecular weight subset of the radiolabeled material, consistent with the interpretation that multiple SV2 isoforms are phosphoproteins in the synapse. Radiolabeled phospho-SV2 was also generated in crude synaptic vesicle preparations incubated with [γ-32P]ATP (Fig.1 B), indicating that an SV2 kinase is associated with synaptic vesicles. These studies demonstrate that SV2 is phosphorylated in intact nerve terminals and in synaptic vesicle preparations and suggest that SV2 is a phosphoprotein in vivo. SV2 contains two major cytoplasmic domains, the amino terminus, which is the most divergent region of the three isoforms, and a loop linking the sixth and seventh membrane domains. Because the amino terminus mediates the interaction of SV2A and SV2C with the synaptic vesicle protein synaptotagmin (19.Schivell A.E. Batchelor R.H. Bajjalieh S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27770-27775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), 2S. Bajjalieh, manuscript in preparation. we were especially interested in determining whether it is phosphorylated. We therefore compared phosphopeptide maps of native SV2 with phosphopeptide maps of GST fusion proteins containing the cytoplasmic amino terminus of SV2A and SV2B (GST-AN and GST-BN, respectively) that had been phosphorylated with synaptic vesicle-associated kinases. Native SV2 was labeled in situ by incubation of synaptic vesicle preparations with [32P]ATP and then isolated by immunoprecipitation using either a monoclonal antibody that recognizes all known SV2 isoforms or a polyclonal antibody specific to SV2A. Trypsin-digested peptide fragments were resolved by two-dimensional chromatography, and radiolabeled peptides were visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 2). Comparison of the peptide map total SV2 with the map of SV2A reveals that SV2A phosphopeptides make up a subset of those present in the total SV2 map. This is consistent with the interpretation that multiple isoforms of SV2 are phosphorylated. Phosphopeptide maps of GST-BN and GST-AN each contained a major phosphopeptide that migrated identically to phosphopeptides present in maps of native SV2. GST without attached SV2 was not phosphorylated (Fig. 3), indicating that the phosphopeptides observed on the maps reflect phosphorylation of the amino termini of SV2. These results indicate that the cytoplasmic amino terminus of SV2 is phosphorylated and suggest that synaptic vesicle kinase(s) phosphorylate the recombinant peptides at sites identical to those phosphorylated in the native protein. The presence of additional phosphopeptides in the maps of GST-AN and GST-BN maps may reflect additional sites of phosphorylation in the peptides. Alternatively, differential susceptibility to trypsin digestion could have produced differences in peptide migration patterns. The two phosphopeptides specific to the maps of total SV2 and SV2A (Fig. 3, small dark arrowheads) suggest sites of phosphorylation outside the amino terminus, perhaps in the cytoplasmic loop between the sixth and seventh membrane domains.Figure 3GST is not phosphorylated by synaptic vesicle protein kinases. To determine whether the GST moiety of GST fusion proteins is a substrate for synaptic vesicle-associated kinases, the phosphorylation of GST and GST-SV2A amino terminus peptide (GST-AN) by synaptic vesicle-associated protein kinases was compared. Shown is an autoradiogram of 2 μg of GST or GST-SV2A (GST-AN) incubated with 100 μg of synaptic vesicle protein and [γ-32P]ATP. Peptides were reisolated and resolved by SDS-PAGE, and phosphopeptides were visualized by autoradiography. No phosphorylation of the 27-kDa GST protein was observed, whereas the 45-kDa GST-AN was phosphorylated. These results indicate that phosphorylation of GST-SV2 peptides reflects phosphorylation of the SV2 and not the GST portion of the fusion protein.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Both serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases have been identified in the nerve terminal (25.Nairn A.C.

To identify the class of kinase that phosphorylates SV2, we performed phosphoamino acid analysis. Both acid (Fig.4) and base (which favors the retention of phosphotyrosine (22.Kamps M.P. Sefton B.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 22-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar)) hydrolysis methods were used. Both produced only phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues, indicating that SV2 is phosphorylated by serine/threonine kinases. We next sought to determine the molecular weight of the SV2 kinase(s) utilizing an in-gel kinase assay. With this procedure, proteins are resolved in gels containing substrate, after which they are incubated with radiolabeled ATP in reaction mixtures appropriate for kinase activity. Following the reaction, phosphorylated substrate co-localizes with kinases in the gel, and the location of active kinases can be detected by autoradiography. Synaptic vesicle proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE in gels containing GST-AN or in control gels cast with no protein. Following denaturation and renaturation procedures, the gels were incubated in reaction mixtures containing [γ-32P]ATP, washed and exposed to film. In gels containing GST-AN, two distinct bands between 36 and 40 kDa were visualized by autoradiography (Fig. 5). The absence of bands in control gels indicated that the labeled bands correspond to phosphorylation of the GST-AN peptide and not to autophosphorylation. These results suggest that there are two synaptic vesicle-associated kinases that can phosphorylate the amino terminus of SV2A and that their catalytic subunits are approximately 36 and 40 kDa. Protein kinases known to be present in the nerve terminal with catalytic subunits of this size include CKI (20.Gross S.D. Hoffman D.P. Fisette P.L. Baas P. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), PKA (28.Hofmann F. Beavo J.A. Bechtel P.J. Krebs E.G. J. Biol.

Of these, SV2 contains substrate consensus sequences for PKA and CKI, suggesting that one or both are the kinases responsible for SV2 phosphorylation in this assay, a possibility supported by the observation that purified CKI and PKA phosphorylate GST-AN peptidein vitro (not shown). To determine whether PKA and/or CKI are responsible for the phosphorylation of SV2 in situ, we examined the effects of kinase-specific activators and inhibitors on the phosphorylation of native SV2 in synaptosomes and synaptic vesicle preparations. To test the possibility that PKA is an SV2 kinase, we examined the effects of the PKA activator 8-bromo-cAMP on SV2 phosphorylation in both synaptosome and synaptic vesicle preparations. In neither case did 8-bromo-cAMP increase SV2 phosphorylation (data not shown). To determine whether CKI is an SV2 kinase, the effect of the CKI inhibitor CKI-7 (31.Chijiwa T. Hagiwara M. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4924-4927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was tested. Incubation of crude synaptic vesicle preparations with increasing concentrations of CKI-7 led to a decrease in phosphorylation of native SV2 with an IC50 of approximately 10 μm (Fig.6), a concentration reported to be specific for CKI (31.Chijiwa T. Hagiwara M. Hidaka H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4924-4927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicate that CKI is a primary SV2 kinase. This interpretation is supported by the presence of an identical phosphopeptide in the phosphopeptide maps of GST-AN phosphorylated by recombinant CKI and GST-AN phosphorylated by synaptic vesicle-associated kinases (Fig. 2). In addition, we have observed that the inositol lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) inhibits phosphorylation of GST-AN by crude synaptic vesicle preparations (not shown). This lipid was reported by Grosset al. (20.Gross S.D. Hoffman D.P. Fisette P.L. Baas P. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) to inhibit the activity of a synaptic vesicle-associated CKI. Finally, we have observed that SV2 phosphorylation is stimulated by excess magnesium (not shown), a characteristic of CKI (32.Tuazon P.T. Traugh J.A. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1991; 23: 13-164Google Scholar). Together these results suggest that CKI acts as an SV2 kinase in vivo. The amino terminus of SV2A mediates its interaction with synaptotagmin. The finding that this region of SV2 is phosphorylated suggested that the SV2-synaptotagmin interaction might be regulated by phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the effects of phosphorylation on the binding of recombinant His6-SV2A amino terminus peptides (His-AN) to recombinant peptides corresponding to the cytoplasmic domain of synaptotagmin (GST-syt). For these experiments, His-AN peptide was incubated in an initial reaction in the absence or presence of recombinant CKI, after which peptide was reisolated and used in binding studies with GST-syt. Phosphorylation by CKI was confirmed in parallel reactions (data not shown). Unphosphorylated His-AN bound GST-syt, as reported previously (19.Schivell A.E. Batchelor R.H. Bajjalieh S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27770-27775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). However, at identical concentrations, phospho-His-AN demonstrated significantly increased binding, suggesting that the affinity of the interaction is higher when SV2 is phosphorylated (Fig.7 A, top). Increased binding was not due to differences in the amount of GST-syt present in the binding incubation as shown by Ponceau staining of the immunoblot (Fig. 7 A, bottom). Quantitation revealed a greater than 2-fold stimulation in binding (Fig. 7 B). Consistent with these findings, we have observed that SV2 expressed in fibroblasts is not significantly phosphorylated and that it binds recombinant synaptotagmin much more weakly than SV2 isolated from brain. 3A. Schivell and S. Bajjalieh, unpublished observations. These results indicate that phosphorylation of SV2 modulates its binding to synaptotagmin and suggest that the SV2-synaptotagmin interaction may be regulated in vivo through changes in SV2 phosphorylation. The synaptic vesicle protein SV2 is a membrane glycoprotein common to all synaptic vesicles and is essential for normal neurotransmission. We have shown here that SV2 is a phosphoprotein in situ, that it is phosphorylated on its cytoplasmic amino terminus, and that phosphorylation modulates SV2 binding to synaptotagmin. These results suggest that phosphorylation regulates SV2 action in vivo. Although SV2 possesses the substrate consensus sites of several protein kinases, results from phosphopeptide mapping, in gel kinase assays, and kinase inhibitor studies suggest that a primary SV2 kinase is casein kinase I. The casein kinase I family contains at least seven members (33.Gross S.D. Anderson R.A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 119: 699-711Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The α isoform, which is present on synaptic vesicles, was previously suggested to be an SV2 kinase, because incubation of synaptic vesicles in reactions permissive to CKI activity resulted in the phosphorylation of SV2 (20.Gross S.D. Hoffman D.P. Fisette P.L. Baas P. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Our studies support this interpretation and suggest that CKI is the primary SV2 kinase. The CKI substrate consensus site requires negatively charged amino acids 1–2 positions upstream. In some cases, this is provided by a phosphoamino acid (33.Gross S.D. Anderson R.A. Cell. Signal. 1998; 119: 699-711Crossref Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Therefore, for some substrates, CKI activity is indirectly regulated by other protein kinases. Although several of the potential CKI sites in SV2 require upstream phosphorylation, we were unable to influence the phosphorylation of SV2 by activators of PKA or protein kinase C or by potassium depolarization of radiolabeled synaptosomes (data not shown), suggesting that CKI phosphorylation of SV2 is regulated independently of other kinases. The isoform of CKI present at the synapse is negatively regulated by the lipid PIP2 (20.Gross S.D. Hoffman D.P. Fisette P.L. Baas P. Anderson R.A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 711-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and PIP2 inhibited SV2 phosphorylation in crude synaptic vesicle preparations (data not shown). It is interesting to note that generation of PIP2has been linked to the priming of regulated secretory vesicles (34.Hay J.C. Fisette P.L. Jenkins G.H. Fukami K. Takenawa T. Anderson R.A. Martin T.F.J. Nature. 1995; 374: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). It is reasonable to speculate that one of the consequences of vesicle priming is decreased SV2 phosphorylation, which in turn would result in decreased affinity of SV2 for synaptotagmin. However, whether the half-life of higher PIP2 concentrations is long enough to significantly affect SV2 phosphorylation levels is currently unknown. The role of the SV2-synaptotagmin interaction, like the action of both proteins, remains unknown. SV2 binds the second calcium binding (C2B) domain of synaptotagmin, a region of the protein essential to its function (35.DiAntonio A. Parfit K. Schwarz T.L. Cell. 1993; 73: 1281-1290Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The C2B domain has been reported to interact with multiple synaptic molecules (38.Zhang J.Z.

A. 1997; 94: 5404-5410Crossref Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Interestingly, all of these interactions, including the interaction with SV2, map to the same region of the C2B domain (39.Fukuda M. Aruga J. Niinobe M. Aimoto S. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29206-29211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Chapman E.R. Desai R.C. Davis A.F. Tornehl C.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32966-32972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar).2 It is therefore possible that SV2 regulates the availability of synaptotagmin for its other binding partners. Consistent with this hypothesis, a small peptide corresponding to a short region of the SV2 amino terminus was reported to increase synaptotagmin binding to the adaptor protein AP2 (45.Haucke V. De Camilli P. Science. 1999; 285: 1268-1271Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Whether this effect is via direct interaction of SV2 with synaptotagmin or with AP2 is unknown, but it suggests a role for the SV2-synaptotagmin interaction in regulating synaptotagmin's interactions. Alternatively, the SV2-synaptotagmin interaction may regulate SV2's ability to act as a transporter, a function suggested b SV2's structural similarity to small molecule transporters. Precedent for this hypothesis is provided by the observation that the C2B domain of synaptotagmin can confer hemicolinium-3 sensitivity to endogenous choline transporters in oocytes (46.O'Regan S. Birman S. Meunier F.-M. Mol. Brain Res. 1995; 32: 135-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Finally, although we have demonstrated that phosphorylation affects SV2 binding to synaptotagmin, phosphorylation may also directly regulate SV2 transport activity or membrane trafficking. This interpretation is consistent with the observation that SV2B, which does not bind synaptotagmin, is also a phosphoprotein. The cycle of synaptic vesicle exo- and endocytosis requires the carefully orchestrated formation and dissociation of protein complexes. Regulation of binding affinity through phosphorylation is likely to mediate changes in secretory efficiency that contribute to synaptic plasticity. The results reported here suggest that SV2 function is regulated by phosphorylation and therefore may serve as a site of modulation in the synapse.

Poly-N-acetyllactosamines are often modified to express differentiation antigens and functional oligosaccharides. One of those oligosaccharides is sialyl LeX,1NeuNAcα2→3Galβ1→4(Fucα1→3)GlcNAc→R discovered in human granulocytes and monocytes (11.Fukuda M. Spooncer E. Oates J.E. Dell A. Klock J.C. J. Biol.

Since these O-glycans are present as clusters in mucin-type glycoproteins, mucin-type glycoproteins can present multiple ligands to a selectin. In mucin-type glycoproteins of blood cells, sialyl LeX can be found in core 2-branched oligosaccharides (5.Fukuda M. Carlsson S.R. Klock J.C. Dell A. J. Biol.

The enzyme responsible for core 2 branching is called core 2 β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (C2GnT), and its cDNA has been cloned (20.Bierhuizen M.F. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9326-9330Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). When C2GnT was inactivated by gene targeting, leukocytes from those mutant mice exhibit much reduced binding to P-, L-, and E-selectin, although the effect on E-selectin binding was less severe than binding to P- and L-selectin (21.Ellies L.G.

In the gastrointestinal tract, oligosaccharides with core 3, GlcNAcβ1→3GalNAc, can be frequently found (22.Schachter H. Brockhausen I. Allen H.J. Kisailus E.C. Glycoconjugates: Composition, Structure, and Function. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1992: 263-332Google Scholar). In these tissues, core 3 is converted to core 4 by core 4 β1,6-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (C4GnT), forming Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6(GlcNAcβ1→3)GalNAc (23.Hounsell E.F. Fukuda M. Powell M.E. Feizi T.

This enzyme is unique in having a major C2GnT activity and a minor I branching activity in addition to C4GnT activity. The expression profile of this novel C2/C4/IGnT (termed C2GnT-mucin type) is consistent with the expression profile of core 4 oligosaccharides in various tissues (22.Schachter H. Brockhausen I. Allen H.J. Kisailus E.C. Glycoconjugates: Composition, Structure, and Function. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1992: 263-332Google Scholar, 25.Yeh J.-C. Ong E. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3215-3221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In these tissues, C4GnT activity is always associated with C2GnT activity, suggesting that C2GnT-mucin type is probably the enzyme responsible for the formation of core 4-branched oligosaccharides in these tissues. Since core 4 oligosaccharides can be further modified to express sialyl LeX inN-acetyllactosaminyl side chains, the synthesis of core 4 and its poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl extension provide a basis for the formation of functional oligosaccharides. These results indicate that it is crucial to understand the synthesis of N-acetyllactosamine repeats in core 2- or core 4-branchedO-glycans as well as in N-glycans. To this end, we have previously demonstrated (27.Ujita M. M c Auliffe J. Schwientek T. Almeida R. Hindsgaul O. Clausen H. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34843-34849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) that poly-N-acetyllactosamines in core 2-branchedO-glycans are synthesized with a newly discovered member of β1,4-galactosyltransferase, β4Gal-TIV (28.Schwientek T.

Nakagawa S. Sekine S. Nishi T. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14294-14299Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). We have also found that β4Gal-TI, iGnT, and I-branching enzyme (IGnT) are involved in the synthesis of I-branched poly-N-acetyllactosamines (30.Ujita M. McAuliffe J. Suzuki M. Hindsgaul O. Clausen H. Fukuda M.N. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9296-9304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In the same study, we found that the addition of N-acetyllactosamine repeats to linear N-acetyllactosamine is preferred over the extension of N-acetyllactosamine to an I branch, mainly because galactosylation of a GlcNAcβ1→6 branch is inefficient (30.Ujita M.

Third, we demonstrated that similar size and similar amounts of poly-N-acetyllactosamine are synthesized in both side chains of GlcNAcβ1→6(GlcNAcβ1→2)Manα1→6Manβ1→R, which was preformed by the action of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V. We found that this equal distribution of poly-N-acetyllactosamines is achieved because β4Gal-TI and iGnT have complementary branch specificity toward two side chains (31.Ujita M. M c Auliffe J. Hindsgaul O. Sasaki K. Fukuda M.N. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16717-16726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These results prompted us in the present study to determine how poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthesis is regulated in bothN- and O-glycans. Our results demonstrate that β4Gal-TI is most efficient for poly-N-acetyllactosamine synthesis in N-glycan acceptors and that iGnT but not β4Gal-TI decreases its enzymatic activity as acceptors contain increasing numbers ofN-acetyllactosamine repeats. We also demonstrated that β4Gal-TI predominantly galactosylates core 4-branchedO-glycans. Moreover, we found that fewerN-acetyllactosamine extensions can be formed on core 4- than on core 2-branched oligosaccharides, mainly because iGnT is inefficient on core 4-branched acceptors. The cDNA encoding iGnT was cloned into pcDNA3.1, resulting in pcDNA3.1-iGnT as described previously (29.Sasaki K. Kurata-Miura K. Ujita M. Angata K. Nakagawa S. Sekine S. Nishi T. Fukuda M. Proc.

The catalytic domain of iGnT was cloned into this vector, resulting in pcDNAI-A·iGnT (29.Sasaki K. Kurata-Miura K. Ujita M. Angata K. Nakagawa S. Sekine S. Nishi T. Fukuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Alternatively, the culture medium was concentrated 100- or 1,000-fold by a Centricon 10 concentrator (Amicon) and directly used as an enzyme source. In most of the studies, the concentrated culture medium was used for iGnT, since IgG-Sepharose-bound enzymes had a low activity as seen for other glycosyltransferases (34.Bakker H. Van Tetering A.

Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6(GlcNAcβ1→3)GalNAcα1→octyl (compound 1) was synthesized from octylO-(3,4,6-tri-O-acetyl-2-deoxy-2-phthalimido-β-d-glucopyranosyl)-(1→3)-2-acetamido-4,6-O-benzylidene-2- deoxy-α-d-galactopyranoside (compound 2) and ethylO-(2,3,4,6- tetra-O-acetyl-β-d-galactopyranosyl)-(1→4)-3,6-di-O-benzyl-2-deoxy-2-phthalimido-1-thio-β-d-glucopyranoside (compound 3). All glycosylation reactions were performed under nitrogen in the presence of 4-Å molecular sieves and monitored by thin layer chromatography. Briefly, compound 2 was allowed to couple with compound 3 in the presence of dimethyl(methylthio)sulfoniumtriflate to furnish octylO-(2,3,4,6-tetra-O-acetyl-β-d-galactopyranosyl)-(1→4)-O-(3,6-di-O-benzyl-2-deoxy-2-phthalimido-β-d-glucopyranosyl)-(1→6)-[(3,4,6-tri-O-acetyl-2-deoxy-2-phthalimido-β-d-glucopyranosyl)-(1→3)]-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-galactopyranoside (compound 4).

Compound 2 was synthesized by conjugation of octyl 2-acetamido-4,6-O-benzylidene-2-deoxy-α-d-galactopyranoside and 3,4,6-tri-O-acetyl-2-deoxy-2-phthalimido-β-d-glucopyranosyl trichloroacetimidate using trimethylsilyl trifluoromethanesulfonate as catalyst.

To assay poly-N-acetyllactosamine formation, 0.5 mm acceptor was incubated with different β4Gal-Ts (760.0 nmol/h/ml) and iGnT (380.0 nmol/h/ml) under the conditions described previously (27.Ujita M.

The radioactivity of aliquots in the effluent was determined. Peaks containing one and two N-acetyllactosamine repeats were separately digested with Escherichia freundiiendo-β-galactosidase for 18 h at 37 °C (41.Fukuda M.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3900-3905Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The digest was purified by a Sep-Pak column and applied to a column of Bio-Gel P-2 (−400 mesh) as described previously (27.Ujita M. M c Auliffe J. Schwientek T. Almeida R. Hindsgaul O. Clausen H.

To assay the transfer of galactose residues by β4Gal-T, the reaction mixture was exactly the same as described previously (27.Ujita M. M c Auliffe J. Schwientek T. Almeida R. Hindsgaul O. Clausen H. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34843-34849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Similarly, the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine by iGnT was assayed exactly in the same way as described previously (27.Ujita M. M c Auliffe J. Schwientek T. Almeida R. Hindsgaul O. Clausen H. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34843-34849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In all of the above incubations, the reaction mixture was incubated for 10 h to analyze the products or for 1 h to obtain kinetic parameters. Previously, we have shown that iGnT and β4Gal-TI can form poly-N-acetyllactosamines in N-glycan acceptors (27.Ujita M. M c Auliffe J. Schwientek T. Almeida R. Hindsgaul O. Clausen H. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34843-34849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). To determine if other members of the β4Gal-T family may be also involved in poly-N-acetyllactosamine formation inN-glycans, N-glycan acceptors were incubated with iGnT and different members of β4Gal-T. As shown in Fig. 1, A andF, β4Gal-TI together with iGnT efficiently formed poly-N-acetyllactosamines on both Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→6Manα1→6Manβ1→octyl and Galβ1→4GlcNAcβ1→2Manα1→6Manβ1→octyl. As many as four (possibly five) N-acetyllactosamine units were added to both acceptors. In contrast, together with iGnT, β4Gal-TII and -TIII added two N-acetyllactosamine units as a maximum, while β4Gal-TIV and -TV added only one N-acetyllactosamine unit (Fig. 1). Moreover, the total amount of N-acetyllactosamine incorporation by β4Gal-TII, -TIII, -TIV, or -TV and iGnT was less than half of that incorporated by β4Gal-TI and iGnT. The above results can be obtained if β4Gal-TII, -TIII, -TIV, and -TV are less efficient in galactosylation of the shortest acceptor containing only oneN-acetylglucosamine (structure a in Fig. 2). Alternatively, these β4Gal-Ts are less efficient in galactosylation of acceptors containing more than one N-acetyllactosamine unit. As shown in Fig.2 A, β4Gal-TI is very efficient in galactosylation of the acceptors tested and barely decreased its galactosylation efficiency when acceptors contained increasing numbers ofN-acetyllactosaminyl repeats. In contrast, β4Gal-TIV or -TV added much less galactose to N-glycan acceptors because their K m is much higher than that for β4Gal-TI (Fig. 2, D and E, TableI). Moreover, β4Gal-TIV significantly decreases its V max once the acceptor contains more than one N-acetyllactosamine unit (structure b in Fig. 2), while β4Gal-TV has much lowerV max than β4Gal-TI irrespective of the number of N-acetyllactosamine units present in the acceptors (TableI). β4Gal-TII has as low a V max value as β4Gal-TV, but its K m is lower than that of β4Gal-TI (Table I). Similarly, K m for β4Gal-TIII is lower than that of β4Gal-TI, but β4Gal-TIII has lowerV max than β4Gal-TI (Table I). Moreover, β4Gal-TIII decreases its V max significantly once the acceptor contains two N-acetyllactosamine units (structure c in Fig. 2, Table I). These are probably the reasons why β4Gal-TII or β4Gal-TIII, together with iGnT, managed to add two N-acetyllactosamine units, although the amount of the products was still less than that by β4Gal-TI and iGnT (Fig. 1). These results, as a whole, indicate that β4Gal-TI is most efficient in galactosylation of poly-N-acetyllactosaminyl N-glycan acceptors as well as a single N-acetyllactosaminyl N-glycan acceptor.Table IKinetic properties of iGnT and β4Gal-TsSubstrateiGnTβ4Gal-TIβ4Gal-TIIβ4Gal-TIIIβ4Gal-TIVβ4Gal-TVK mV maxK mV maxK mV maxK mV maxK mV maxK mV maxmmRelative values (%)mmRelative values (%)mmRelative values (%)mmRelative values (%)mmRelative values (%)mmRelative values (%)GlcNAcβ1–6Manα1–6Manβ-octyl0.88100aV max for β4Gal-Ts is compared with the V max (118.3 nmol/h/ml) obtained for β4Gal-TI using GlcNAcβ1–6Manα1–6Manβ-octyl as an acceptor.0.30140.63435.92632.7912Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–6Manα1–6Manβ-octyl1.19100bV max of iGnT is compared with the V max (97.8 nmol/h/ml) obtained using Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–6Manα1–6Manβ-octyl as an acceptor.GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–6Manα1–6Manβ-octyl1.14 1090.37130.66464.76352.6510Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–6Manα1–6Manβ-octyl1.06 52GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–6Manα1–6Manβ-octyl1.08 1030.38140.7294.9852.6811Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–3Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–6Manα1–6Manβ-octyl0.85 38a V max for β4Gal-Ts is compared with the V max (118.3 nmol/h/ml) obtained for β4Gal-TI using GlcNAcβ1–6Manα1–6Manβ-octyl as an acceptor.b V max of iGnT is compared with the V max (97.8 nmol/h/ml) obtained using Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–6Manα1–6Manβ-octyl as an acceptor.

This strain, which is released upon binding to target proteases, is essential for the inhibitory activity of serpins. To understand the structural basis of the native strain, we previously characterized stabilizing mutations of α1-antitrypsin, a prototypical inhibitory serpin, in regions such as the hydrophobic core. The present study evaluates the effects of single point mutations throughout the molecule on stability and protease inhibitory activity. We identified stabilizing mutations in most secondary structures, suggesting that the native strain is distributed throughout the molecule. Examination of the substitution patterns and the structures of the mutation sites revealed surface hydrophobic pockets as a component of the native strain in α1-antitrypsin, in addition to the previously identified unusual interactions such as side chain overpacking and cavities. Interestingly, many of the stabilizing substitutions did not affect the inhibitory activity significantly. Those that affected the activity were confined in the regions that are mobilized during the complex formation with a target enzyme. The results of our study should be useful for designing proteins with strain and for regulating the stability and functions of serpins.

It has been suggested that the rate of loop insertion is critical for inhibitory function; retardation of the loop insertion would alter the partitioning between the inhibitory and substrate pathways in such a way that the SI values would increase (11.Wright H.T.

Release of the native strain of serpins, upon interaction with a protease, may regulate conformational changes such as loop insertion during the complex formation. To elucidate the structural basis and functional roles of the native strain, we have previously characterized the effects of single amino acid substitutions of α1AT, which increased the stability of the molecule presumably by releasing the native strain at the substitution sites (5.Lee K.N. Park S.D. Yu M.-H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 20.Im H. Seo E.J. Yu M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11072-11777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Our previous studies focused on the hydrophobic core (strands 4–6 of B β-sheet and helix B) and the region that presumably accepts the inserting RCL during the inhibitory complex formation (strands 3 and 5 of A sheet, helix F, and the loop connecting helix F and strand 3 of A sheet). Various unfavorable interactions such as overpacking of side chains, buried polar groups, and cavities were suggested as the structural basis of the native strain in α1AT (5.Lee K.N. Park S.D. Yu M.-H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 6.Ryu S.-E. Choi H.-J. Kwon K.-S. Lee K.N. Yu M.-H.

In the present study, the mutational analyses were expanded over the entire molecule, in order to locate additional sites critical to its stability and activity. We excluded the RCL from the target region because mutations at almost every site in the RCL are likely to affect the inhibitory activity (18.Gils A. Knockaert I. Declerck P.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7474-7481Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) without any relevance to the strain, as in the case of many genetic variations (21.Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Results from the current study revealed that the native strain of inhibitory serpins is distributed throughout the molecule. Interestingly, many of the stabilizing substitutions did not affect the inhibitory activity significantly. The activity-regulating strain appears to be highly localized to those regions that are presumably mobilized during the complex formation with a target enzyme. Plasmids for α1AT expression in Escherichia coli and purification of recombinant α1AT protein were described previously (22.Kwon K.-S. Kim J. Shin H.S. Yu M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9627-9731Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined in 6m guanidium hydrochloride, calculated from tyrosine and tryptophan content of the α1AT protein (23.Edelhoch H. Biochemistry. 1967; 6: 1948-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (3007) Google Scholar). Ultrapure urea was purchased from ICN Biochemicals. Porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE), human leukocyte elastase (HLE), human plasma α1AT,N-succinyl-(Ala)3-p-nitroanilide, andN-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-p-nitroanilide were purchased from Sigma. All other chemicals were reagent grade. Random mutagenesis at target regions of α1AT cDNA was performed as described previously, using degenerative oligonucleotides (5.Lee K.N. Park S.D. Yu M.-H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 20.Im H. Seo E.J. Yu M.-H. J. Biol.

The lysates were heated for 90 min at 60 °C to inactivate unstable α1AT activity. Mutant clones showing thermostable α1AT activity were identified after PPE treatment. Representative clones obtained in the first screening were analyzed further by kinetic measurement of heat-induced activity loss of the lysates at 53 °C. The residual inhibitory activity was detected by treatment with PPE. The clones that showed increased half-life in heat-induced inactivation were selected for further analyses. The mutation sites were identified by DNA sequencing. Most mutations were single amino acid substitutions, and many such substitutions were obtained more than once, suggesting that the mutations were saturated. Several mutants carried substitutions at more than one residue. To evaluate the mutational effect at each site, these multiple substitutions were separated to single amino acid substitutions. The substitutions at specific sites were generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (24.Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). Equilibrium unfolding as a function of urea concentration was monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy at 25 °C in 10 mm potassium phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.5. Experimental data of the fluorescence measurement were fitted to a two-state unfolding model, details of which were described previously (5.Lee K.N. Park S.D. Yu M.-H. Nat. Struct.

Chem. 1998; 273: 2509-2516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The active concentration of PPE was determined by measuring the initial rates of hydrolysis of 1 mm N-succinyl-(Ala)3-p-nitroanilide. The active concentration of HLE was determined as described previously (26.Hopkins P.C.R. Carrell R.W. Stone S.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7650-7657Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) with trypsin-titrated human plasma α1AT and a substrate,N-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-p-nitroanilide. Various amounts of purified recombinant α1AT proteins were incubated in 50 μl of assay buffer (30 mm phosphate, 160 mm NaCl, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, and 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) with 100 nm PPE or HLE at designated molar ratios of α1AT to protease. After incubation with the protease at 37 °C for 10 min, the reaction mixture was diluted 10-fold with the assay buffer and residual enzyme activity was determined (27.Travis J. Johnson D. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 80: 754-765Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The association rate constant for the interaction of recombinant α1AT with PPE was measured in a reaction mixture containing equimolar concentrations (8 nm) of the protease and the inhibitor (28.Beatty K. Bieth J. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3931-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thermostable mutations of α1AT were obtained at 50 sites, which were distributed over most secondary structures of α1AT (Fig.1) except strand 6 of A sheet (s6A), strands 1 and 3 of B sheet (s1B,s3B), and strands 3 of C sheet (s3C). These mutations were selected based on the enhanced kinetic stability against heat-induced inactivation (see “Materials and Methods”). The conformational stability of each mutant α1AT was measured through equilibrium unfolding in urea by monitoring changes in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence intensity (Fig.2). The midpoint of the unfolding transition, Cm , of the wild-type α1AT in urea at 25 °C was 1.8 m. Most of the thermostable mutations shifted the Cm values to a higher urea concentration, which indicates that conformational stability was also increased. Changes in the free energy of stabilization by these substitutions are summarized in TableI. Results from the previous studies on the mutations at the hydrophobic core region and the RCL insertion site are also included. Half of the 50 substitutions documented in Table Iincreased the conformational stability more than 1 kcal mol−1, while 11 of them increased the conformational stability less than 0.3 kcal mol−1. To investigate the effect of the mutations on the inhibitory activity, the SI values toward PPE were measured (Fig. 3; TableI). Most of the mutations did not affect the inhibitory activity significantly, causing the changes of less than 10% in SI (Fig. 1,blue beads). However, several mutations increased the SI values significantly (Fig. 1, red beads; TableI, bold numbers).Figure 2Urea-induced equilibrium unfolding of thermostable α1AT mutants. The unfolding transition was measured by the increase in fluorescence emission intensity (λex = 280 nm, λex = 360 nm). Samples were equilibrated in a urea solution containing 10 mm potassium phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, pH 6.5 at 25 °C for 8 h. The protein concentration was 10 μg/ml. ●, wild-type; ○, T114I; ■, A142V; ▵, R196S; ▿, K335G; ⋄, P362L.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IMolecular properties of thermostable mutations of α1ATLocationsaLocations of the mutations on the secondary structures.

A constant concentration of the protease was mixed with varying concentrations of each α1AT mutant. After incubation at 37 °C for 10 min in the assay buffer (30 mm phosphate, 160 mm NaCl, 0.1% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4), the residual protease activity was measured with 1 mm N-succinyl-Ala-Ala-Ala-p-nitroanilide as a substrate. ●, wild-type; ○, R196S; ■, Q212E; ▵, L245Q; ▿, K335G; ⋄, P362L.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Among the newly identified mutations that affected the inhibitory activity more than 10% (Table I, bold numbers), G117V increased the conformational stability substantially. This substitution mapped to the region that presumably is mobilized during the complex formation (Fig. 1). However, the other four mutations, R196S, Q212E, L245I, and P362L, increased the stability marginally. To understand the relationship between the stability increase and the activity loss at these sites, various other substitutions were introduced at each site. The effects of individual substitutions on the stability and the inhibitory activity toward both PPE and HLE are summarized in TableII. Except for the substitutions at Gln-212, which did not affect the inhibitory activity toward HLE, most of the substitutions caused the loss of activity toward both elastases. The activity losses by the mutations at Leu-245 and Pro-362 were substantial, but were not correlated with the stability increase at all. In order to examine if any of these substitutions affect protease binding, the second order association rate constant was determined. As shown in Table II, the association rate constant (ka) of the variant α1AT with PPE did not differ significantly from the wild-type value, 5.5 × 105m−1 s−1. The association rate with HLE was over 107m−1 s−1 in all cases.Table IIActivity-affecting mutations of α1ATMutationsΔΔG aFrom ΔC m × 3.1 (averagem-value) in kcal mol−1.

Open table in a new tab The present mutational studies addressed several specific questions about native strain in α1AT. What parts of the molecule are strained? What is the structural basis of the native strain in α1AT? Is the native strain at each identified site related to the functional regulation? Results from the current studies revealed that the native form of α1AT is suboptimally folded and the strain is distributed throughout the molecule. However, the strain directly regulating the protease inhibitory activity appears to be highly localized. Examination of the wild-type α1AT crystal structure (29.Elliott P.R. Abrahams J.-P. Lomas D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) revealed that many of the newly identified substitutions map at surface hydrophobic pockets. For instance, the side chain of Ser-36 on helix A is close to the surface pocket formed by Leu-306 of helix I and Asn-81 of the loop connecting helix C and helix D (Fig. 4). Substitution to bulky arginine at the 36 site (S36R) may provide better packing interactions in the pocket. Another mutation site in helix A, Asn-29, is very close to Phe-82 of the loop connecting helix C and helix D (Fig. 4 A). The substitution to tyrosine (N29Y) may provide good aromatic-aromatic interactions with Phe-82. Several other substitutions appear to permit better packing interactions at surface pockets, which are indicated in Table I(denoted as SP). A surface hydrophobic pocket near T114I formed between helix D and strand 2 of A sheet was also identified previously by structural examination (29.Elliott P.R. Abrahams J.-P. Lomas D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The T114I substitution increased the conformational stability by 2 kcal mol−1, apparently due to filling of the pocket by the mutation. Our results suggest strongly that the surface pockets are part of the structural design for the metastable native structure of α1AT. Previous sets of thermostable mutations of α1AT (marked in Table I) showed that size reduction or cavity filling (denoted as S and C in Table I, respectively) inside the molecule increased the conformational stability (5.Lee K.N. Park S.D. Yu M.-H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 20.Im H. Seo E.J. Yu M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11072-11777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This was surprising because size reduction inside the proteins usually makes the protein unstable (30.Kellis Jr., J.T. Nyberg K. Sali D. Fersht A.R. Nature. 1988; 333: 784-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar, 31.Eriksson A.E. Baase W.A. Zhang X.J. Heinz D.W. Blaber M. Baldwin E.P. Matthews B.W. Science. 1992; 255: 178-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar), and cavities other than active-site pockets are rarely observed (32.Harpaz Y. Gerstein M. Chothia C. Structure. 1994; 2: 641-649Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). The substitution patterns observed in the new set also showed size reduction at several sites (Table I). Size reduction at the buried sites (for example T27S, A34G, L241I, etc.) may provide better packing by allowing rearrangement of the interlocked side chains. The mutants carrying the K163T, K168I, K174T, E199D, and L245Q substitutions also show the size reduction. These sites are highly exposed, and many of the substitutions show a marginal stabilizing effect. The stabilizing mechanism at these sites is not clear, and these substitutions are accordingly denoted as “(S)” in Table I. Several substitutions in the new set, such as A31V, G117V, A183V, A142V, A248V, and V364I, showed size increase rather than size reduction (TableI). Examination of these sites in the crystal structure (29.Elliott P.R. Abrahams J.-P. Lomas D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) of α1AT revealed the existence of cavities nearby. Cavities are a likely source of energetic cost in conformational stability (33.Kocher J.-P. Prevost M. Wodak S.J. Lee B. Structure. 1996; 4: 1517-1529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and the stabilizing substitutions appear to provide better packing by filling the cavities. Previous studies of the hydrophobic core mutations (5.Lee K.N. Park S.D. Yu M.-H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 497-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 6.Ryu S.-E. Choi H.-J. Kwon K.-S. Lee K.N. Yu M.-H. Structure. 1996; 4: 1181-1192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) suggested that certain buried polar groups provide another structural feature for the native strain in α1AT (designated as Po in Table I) because they do not participate in hydrogen bonding. It has been shown that unpaired polar groups cause energetic cost (34.Fersht A.R. Shi J.-P. Knill-Jones J. Lowe D.M. Wilkinson A.J. Blow D.M. Brick P. Carter P. Waye M.M.Y. Winter G. Nature. 1985; 314: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). Creation of a polar network may be another structural mechanism of the native strain in α1AT, as suggested by the R196S mutation. Arg-196, located beneath the RCL, forms a positively charged network with Arg-223 and Arg-281 (7.Elliott P.R. Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Abrahams J.-P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar, 29.Elliott P.R. Abrahams J.-P. Lomas D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The R196S substitution might relieve the charge repulsion at the site. Several substitutions appear to create salt bridge interactions (Table I, denoted as I). These surface substitutions marginally increased the conformational stability (<0.9 kcal mol−1). It is not clear, however, if any of these sites in the wild-type protein contribute to the native strain. Most of the activity-affecting mutations reside either near the RCL or at the loop insertion site on A sheet (Fig. 1, coloredgreen). If the strain is relevant to inhibitory function, increasing the stability by releasing the strain should decrease the serpin's inhibitory activity. This appears to be the case for the previously identified mutations at Lys-335 and Lys-331, which showed increased conformational stability with a concomitant decrease in the inhibitory activity (20.Im H. Seo E.J. Yu M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11072-11777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the crystal structure of the native α1AT (Fig. 1), these residues are located in strand 5 of A sheet (s5A) and interact with the residues in strand 3 of A sheet (s3A), helix F (hF), and the adjacent loop connecting strand 3 of A sheet and helix F. Among the newly identified sites where stabilizing substitutions reduced the activity, Gly-117 maps in this region. Gly-117 interacts with Tyr-160 of hF and Val-185 in strand 3 of A sheet. It is very likely that the residue interactions in this region must be mobilized to accept the RCL during the complex formation with a target protease. Another site where the native strain may promote the inhibitory activity is Arg-196. Arg-196 has been suggested to form a positively charged pocket near the RCL (7.Elliott P.R. Lomas D.A. Carrell R.W. Abrahams J.-P. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 676-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar,29.Elliott P.R. Abrahams J.-P. Lomas D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Such an unfavorable interaction can drive the conformational change during the complex formation with a target protease. Indeed, there is a modest correlation between activity loss and stability increase among the substitutions at Arg-196 (Table II). The strain at the identified sites may facilitate the conformational change. None of the stabilizing mutations in the other regions of α1AT appeared to decrease the inhibitory activity (TableI). Filling the surface hydrophobic pocket between strand 2 of A sheet and helix D was predicted to inhibit the transition to a more stable conformation (29.Elliott P.R. Abrahams J.-P. Lomas D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). However, T114I, which increased the stability substantially (2 kcal mol−1), presumably by filling the predicted pocket, failed to decrease the inhibitory activity significantly (Table I). These results suggest that only the strain in critical regions of α1AT, such as the regions that are directly involved in the complex formation with a target enzyme, regulates the serpin's inhibitory function. Thermostable mutations at some sites profoundly affected the inhibitory activity without any associated stability increase. Two such sites (Lys-168 and Ile-169) were previously identified (20.Im H. Seo E.J. Yu M.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11072-11777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and three sites (Gln-212, Leu-245, and Pro-362) were identified in the present study. Various other substitutions at the three sites, Gln-212, Leu-245, and Pro-362, also reduced the inhibitory activity without any associated stability increase (Table II). The mutations do not seem to affect the binding of a target protease, because they have only marginal effects on the rate constant for association (ka) with PPE (Table II). It was not surprising that the substitutions at Pro-362 affected the inhibitory activity, because Pro-362 is located at the end of RCL (Fig. 1; P4′ position, 4 residues away from the active site residue, Met-358), at the site where RCL kinks and joins C β-sheet (Fig. 1). This proline may help maintain the rigidity of the RCL needed to maximize the strain loaded on the RCL, which may be directly utilized for the distortion of the protease active site (35.Plotnick M.I. Mayne L. Schechter N.M. Rubin H. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7586-7590Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Leu-245 is exposed at the end of strand 2 of B sheet (Fig. 1, s2B), and appears to fix the proximal hinge region of RCL near Thr-345 (6.Ryu S.-E. Choi H.-J. Kwon K.-S. Lee K.N. Yu M.-H. Structure. 1996; 4: 1181-1192Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar, 29.Elliott P.R. Abrahams J.-P. Lomas D.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 275: 419-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The importance of this hinge region of the RCL has been implied by many genetic mutations in this region of inhibitory serpins (21.Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Gln-212 is exposed at the end of strand 4 of C sheet and is far away from the RCL. It is not clear how the substitutions at Gln-212 affect the activity. Further studies must define the precise roles of these residues in the inhibitory mechanism. Our examination of thermostable mutations of α1AT showed that the native strain is scattered throughout the molecule. The structural instabilities in the native form may well be mobilized during the complex formation with a target protease. Interestingly, however, the destabilization component for regulating the inhibitory function of α1AT is highly localized (Fig. 1 and TableI). Our approach has some potential limitations. Since the mutagenesis method adopted in this study is highly likely to yield only the residue substitutions induced by single nucleotide change (36.Hübner P. Iida S. Arber W. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 73: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), we might have missed some important sites where critical substitutions require more than a single nucleotide change. Despite these limitations, the current mutational analyses clearly provide us perspectives on the stability-function relationship of α1AT by revealing the distribution and structural mechanism of the native strain in α1AT. Information obtained from this study will be a valuable guide in regulating the stability and function of serpins, including developing stable therapeutic serpins without activity compensation."

This activation of gene expression is mediated by binding of the protein to one or more zinc-responsive elements present in the promoters of its target genes. To better understand how Zap1 functions, we mapped its DNA binding domain using a combined in vivo and in vitro approach. Our results show that the Zap1 DNA binding domain maps to the carboxyl-terminal 194 amino acids of the protein; this region contains five of its seven potential zinc finger domains. Fusing this region to the Gal4 activation domain complemented a zap1Δ mutation for low zinc growth and also conferred high level expression on a zinc-responsive element-lacZ reporter. In vitro, the purified 194-residue fragment bound to DNA with a high affinity (dissociation constant in the low nanomolar range) similar to that of longer fragments of Zap1. Furthermore, by deletion and site-directed mutagenesis, we demonstrated that each of the five carboxyl-terminal zinc fingers are required for high affinity DNA binding.

Its nutritional importance can be illustrated by the large number of proteins that require zinc for their function. For example, there are over 300 known zinc metalloenzymes (1.Vallee B.L. Auld D.S. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 5647-5659Crossref PubMed Scopus (1501) Google Scholar), and it has been estimated that as many as 1% of the genes in the human genome encode proteins with C2H2 zinc finger motifs (2.Hoovers J.M. Mannens M. John R. Bliek J. van Heyningen V. Porteous D.J. Leschot N.J. Westerveld A. Little P.F. Genomics. 1992; 12: 254-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In contrast, zinc excess can be toxic to cells so mechanisms of controlling intracellular zinc levels are critical to cell viability. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, zinc homeostasis is largely regulated at the transcriptional level. The Zap1 transcriptional activator directly controls the expression of a number of genes in response to zinc (3.Zhao H. Eide D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5044-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). For example, in zinc-limited cells, Zap1 induces the expression of a high affinity zinc transporter encoded by theZRT1 gene and a low affinity transporter encoded byZRT2 (4.Zhao H. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2454-2458Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar, 5.Zhao H. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23203-23210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Zap1 also controls the transport of stored zinc out of the vacuole by regulating the expression of yet another transporter encoded by the ZRT3gene. 1MacDiarmid, C. W., Gaither, L. A., and Eide, D. (2000) EMBO J., in press.1MacDiarmid, C. W., Gaither, L. A., and Eide, D. (2000) EMBO J., in press. In addition to these important zinc transporters, DNA microarray analysis indicated that perhaps as many as 46 total genes in the yeast genome are directly regulated by this factor. 2T. J. Lyons, A. P. Gasch, L. A. Gaither, D. Botstein, P. O. Brown, and D. J. Eide, submitted for publication.2T. J. Lyons, A. P. Gasch, L. A. Gaither, D. Botstein, P. O. Brown, and D. J. Eide, submitted for publication.Clearly, Zap1 is a critical determinant of zinc homeostasis and the ability of cells to thrive under zinc-limiting conditions. Zap1 binds in a sequence-specific manner to an 11-base pair sequence called the zinc-responsive element (ZRE).3 This element is found in one or more copies in the promoter regions of Zap1 target genes. Experimental evidence (8.Zhao H. Butler E. Rodgers J. Spizzo T. Duesterhoeft S. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28713-28720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) and computer-aided motif analysis of Zap1 target gene promoters2 have indicated that the sequence 5′-ACCTTNAAGGT-3′ is the preferred recognition site for this protein. Determining how Zap1 recognizes and binds to this sequence is a critical issue in understanding how Zap1 functions as a transcriptional activator. Zap1 contains seven potential C2H2zinc finger domains, and previous studies suggested that only a subset of these may be required for ZRE binding in vitro (8.Zhao H. Butler E. Rodgers J. Spizzo T. Duesterhoeft S. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28713-28720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In this study, we use a combined in vitro and in vivo analysis to map the DNA binding domain of Zap1 and determine which of its zinc fingers contribute to ZRE recognition and binding. The strains used in this study are YM4271 (MATa ura3–52 his3-Δ200 ade2–10 lys2–801 leu2–3, 112 trp1–901 tyr1–501 gal4-Δ512 gal80-Δ538 ade5::hisG) (CLONTECH) and DEY1538 (YM4271;zap1Δ::TRP1). Yeast cultures were grown in YP medium containing 2% glucose or in synthetic defined (SD) medium supplemented with 2% glucose and any necessary auxotrophic supplements. Where indicated, EDTA and Zn2+ were added to SD to generate zinc-limiting growth conditions. An alternative low zinc medium, LZM, was prepared as described previously (9.Gitan R.S. Luo H. Rodgers J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28617-28624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). All plasmids generated for this study were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The ZAP1 open reading frame was PCR-amplified with primers containing added 5′ and 3′SalI sites. This fragment was inserted intoSalI-digested pGAD424 (CLONTECH) to create pGAD-Zap11–880. Other GAD-Zap1 fusions were created similarly with 5′ primers containing an added EcoRI site and 3′ primers containing a BamHI site. The fragment containing GAD-Zap1Δ553–686 was generated by two-step overlapping PCR (10.Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar) and cloned into pGAD424 as described above. pGAD424 allows expression of cloned inserts from the ADH1 promoter. To allow expression from the GAL1 promoter, the fragments encoding the Gal4 activation domain-Zap1 fusions were subcloned into pRS316-GAL1 (11.Liu H. Krizek J. Bretscher A. Genetics. 1992; 132: 665-673Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by gap repair (12.Kunes S. Ma H. Overbye K. Fox M.S. Botstein D. Genetics. 1987; 115: 73-81Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression from theGAL1 promoter using the GEV β-estradiol-responsive system was performed as described by Gao and Pinkham. 4C. Y. Gao and J. L. Pinkham, submitted for publication. Cells were co-transformed with plasmid pGEV-HIS3, which expresses a hybrid activator protein, GEV, that contains the Gal4 DNA binding domain, the human estrogen receptor hormone response domain, and the VP16 activation domain. The activity of the GEV protein was induced by adding 100 nm β-estradiol. The c-Myc epitope-taggedZAP1 allele was expressed from plasmid pYef2-mycZap1. 5A. Bird, H. Zhao, H. Luo, L. T. Jensen, C. Srinivasan, M. Evans-Galea, D. R. Winge, and D. J. Eide, manuscript submitted. The Gal4 DNA binding domain fusion plasmid pGBD-Zap1552–880 was generated by PCR-amplifying theZAP1 open reading frame encoding residues 552–880 using primers with added 5′ EcoRI and 3′ BamHI sites. The resulting fragment was inserted intoBamHI-EcoRI-digested pMA424 (14.Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 48: 847-853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). This allele and its mutant derivatives are expressed from the ADH1 promoter.ZAP1 truncate and the zinc finger mutant alleles were subcloned from pMA424 vectors into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using EcoRI and SalI sites to generate NH2-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusions. To create a template for site-directed mutagenesis, a 2-kilobase pair fragment encoding Zap1 amino acids 187–880 was isolated from pGBD-Zap11–880 (see Footnote 5) by digestion with BamHI and SalI and subcloned into BamHI-SalI-digested pBluescript SK+ (Stratagene) to create pAB3. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using Transformer site-directed mutagenesis (CLONTECH) with the following mutagenic primers: mZnF1, 5′-CCTACAAAGACAACTTTTGAAGGATCAAGTCTCTCAAG-3′; mZnF2, 5′-GTTCCATAGTGAACCAAATTAATTGTCAACAAGGTATCAATTTTG-3′; mZnF3, 5′-GGAATTAAACGACCAATTAGAAGCAGTACAATTAACCCGGGG-3′; mZnF4, 5′-CAAAAATTAATCCGTCAATTAAAAGTGCAATCGAAATACAACC-3′; mZnF5, 5′-CTTTAGTTCAGCAAACCAGGACACAATCTGGCGAAAAACC-3′; mZnF6, 5′-CTTTGAAGATTCAAATAAGAACCCAAACTGGTGAAAAACC-3′; mZnF7, 5′-CGTCAAATTTGAGCAAACAAATTAAGACCCAACAGAAAAAATACAAGTGC-3′. Following confirmation of each mutation by DNA sequencing, the region encoding amino acids 552–880 was cloned into pMA424 as described above. Protein extracts were prepared as described previously (9.Gitan R.S. Luo H. Rodgers J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28617-28624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), and protein concentrations were measured by the method of Bradford (15.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar). Samples (5 μg of protein/lane) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and then transferred to nitrocellulose. Blots were incubated with monoclonal anti-Gal4 DNA binding domain antibodies (CLONTECH) or anti-Vph1 vacuolar ATPase 100-kDa subunit (Molecular Probes), washed, incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Pierce), and then detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Indirect immunofluorescence was performed as described previously (9.Gitan R.S. Luo H. Rodgers J. Broderius M. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28617-28624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) using anti-GBD primary antibody (CLONTECH) and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Molecular Probes). Cells were grown for 15–20 h to mid-exponential phase (A 600 = 0.3–0.7) in LZM supplemented with 5 μm ZnCl2. β-Galactosidase activity was assayed as described by Guarente (16.Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 181-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (871) Google Scholar) and is expressed in units calculated as follows (ΔA 420 × 1000)/(min × ml of culture used × absorbance of the culture at 600 nm). The ZRE-lacZ reporter used was pDG2 in which a ZRE fragment was inserted into a minimal CYC1 promoter lacking its normal upstream activation sequences (8.Zhao H. Butler E. Rodgers J. Spizzo T. Duesterhoeft S. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28713-28720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). GST-Zap1 fusion proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysS cells pre-grown at 37 °C to an A 600 of 0.4 in the presence of 0.5 mm ZnSO4. Following transfer to 30 °C, expression was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and the cells were incubated for an additional 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and washed in 0.25 m sucrose. The pellet was resuspended in buffer (20 mmNaH2PO4, 3.6 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.3, 280 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol) containing lysozyme for sonication. The lysate was clarified by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) and the proteins were purified by affinity chromatography using glutathione (GSH)-Sepharose (CLONTECH). Eluted protein was concentrated in VIVA spin concentrators (6000–8000-kDa cut-off), dialyzed against sonication buffer to remove GSH, and analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. The protein was estimated to be >85% pure, and 12 liters of cells typically yielded approximately 8 mg of protein. Where specified, the GST-Zap1538–880 fusion was again bound to GSH-Sepharose and incubated with thrombin (0.1 unit μg−1 protein in sonication buffer) for 6 h at room temperature. Following cleavage of the NH2-terminal GST fragment, the eluted Zap1 protein obtained was of the expected molecular mass and found to be >95% pure by gel electrophoresis. To obtain active protein, GSH affinity-purified GST-Zap1538–880 was further purified using a DNA affinity column. Biotinylated ZRE-1 and ZRE-2 oligonucleotides (see below) were annealed and bound to 5 ml of streptavidin resin (Pierce). Zap1 protein was bound to the resin and washed on ice in low salt buffer (3 mm NaH2PO4, 0.5 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.3, 42 mm NaCl, 0.8 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, 5 mm dithiothreitol). The protein was eluted with 0.75 m NaCl and dialyzed against sonication buffer. Amino acid analysis (Beckman 6300) was used to determine protein concentration following hydrolysis in 5.7 m HCl for 24 h in vacuo at 110 °C. Simultaneous readings of iron, copper, and zinc were obtained by inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy using a Perkin-Elmer Optima 3100XL instrument. Zn2+ levels were also measured by atomic absorption spectrometry (Perkin Elmer AAnalyst 100). Protein samples in sonication buffer were diluted in deionized water as needed prior to analysis. The oligonucleotides ZRE-1 (5′-CCAAAGATACCCTCAAGGTTCTCATCTGTG-3′) and ZRE-2 (5′-CACAGATGAGAACCTTGAGGGTATCTTTGG-3′), containing the consensus sequence for the ZRE recognized by Zap1, were annealed and used in both EMSA and affinity chromatography. Mutant oligonucleotides M2a (5′-GCCAAAGATCAAAGACCTTGTCTCATCTGTGG-3′) and M2b (5′-CCACAGATGAGACAAGGTCTTTGATCTTTGGC-3′), containing a mutated ZRE known to be inactive in vivo with respect to Zap1 function (8.Zhao H. Butler E. Rodgers J. Spizzo T. Duesterhoeft S. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28713-28720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), were used to verify the specificity of Zap1 binding to the ZRE site. The standard 15-μl EMSA reaction contained hybridization mix (65 mm KCl, 0.2 mg ml−1 bovine serum albumin, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7, with 20% glycerol and 0.04% IGEPAL CA-630; Sigma) with end-labeled oligonucleotides and protein in sonication buffer. Following incubation at room temperature for 15 min, the samples were applied to a 6% polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel and electrophoresed for 1.5 h at 30 mA. Gels and running buffer contained 1× Tris borate buffer, pH 8, and they were pre-electrophoresed for 1 h at 30 mA. A reaction lacking protein was used as a “free probe” control. Dried gels were viewed by autoradiography. Results from electrophoretic mobility shifts assays were shown to be identical following incubation of binding reactions for 1 h, 30 min, and 5 min. Therefore, these reactions were judged to be at equilibrium. A series of 15-μl reactions were prepared containing different concentrations of protein in hybridization mix and32P-radiolabeled oligonucleotides maintained at a constant DNA concentration. Reactions were allowed to reach equilibrium by incubation at room temperature for 15 min. The protein-DNA complex was then separated from free DNA by EMSA. Phosphorimages of dried gels were obtained and quantified using QUANTITY ONE software. The percentage of complex formation (as determined by the loss of free DNA) was plotted against concentration on a logarithmic scale to determine the apparentK d. The functional and structural domains of Zap1 that were predicted from its primary amino acid sequence (3.Zhao H. Eide D.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5044-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) are diagrammed in Fig.1. Based on the distribution of acidic residues, this protein was predicted to have two potential activation domains designated AD1 and AD2. Zap1 also contains seven zinc finger motifs that fit the minimal consensus sequence C-X 2–4-C-X 12-H-X 3–5-H. Our previous results suggested that the region containing the five COOH-terminal zinc fingers was sufficient for sequence-specific Zap1 DNA binding (8.Zhao H. Butler E. Rodgers J. Spizzo T. Duesterhoeft S. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28713-28720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). A Zap1 fragment including only amino acids 687–880,i.e. zinc fingers ZnF3–ZnF7, produced in vitroby coupled transcription and translation reactions behaved in EMSA and DNase I footprinting assays in a similar fashion to the wild type protein. It was unclear from these studies, however, whether this domain retained the full DNA binding activity of the intact protein. As a first in vivo test of this hypothesis, the Zap1687–880 region was fused to the Gal4 activation domain (GAD) and tested for its ability to complement a zap1Δ mutation. The GAD fusion approach allows assessment of DNA binding ability without requiring Zap1 activation domain function. Furthermore, the GAD fragment used contains the VP16 nuclear localization sequence to facilitate trafficking of the fusions to the nucleus should the still unmapped Zap1 localization signal be deleted. Wild type and zap1Δ mutant cells grow equally well on zinc-supplemented media (Fig. 2), but thezap1Δ mutant is unable to grow under zinc-limiting conditions. When the full-length Zap1 protein (in this experiment, a functional allele with six NH2-terminal c-Myc epitope tags) was expressed in the zap1Δ mutant from the GAL1promoter, wild type growth in low zinc was restored. Expression of the Gal4 activation domain Zap1687–880 fusion (GAD-Zap1687–880) also strongly complemented the mutant defect. These results supported the in vitro data suggesting that ZnF3–ZnF7 were sufficient for Zap1 DNA binding. We noted that the zap1Δ strain expressing GAD-Zap1687–880 grew slightly slower than the same strain expressing full-length Zap1 (data not shown). Therefore, as an independent test of these complementation results, we compared the ability of the GAD-Zap1687–880 and other GAD-Zap1 fusions to activate expression of a ZRE-lacZ reporter gene in azap1Δ mutant (Fig. 3). These assays were conducted using cells grown in low zinc to avoid the repressive effect of zinc on Zap1 activity. In all cases, these fusions were found to complement the zinc-limited growth defect of thezap1Δ mutant (data not shown). Although wild type cells showed high level lacZ reporter expression, thezap1Δ mutant transformed with the vector alone showed only low levels of β-galactosidase activity. The zap1Δ mutant expressing either the full-length Zap1 protein or amino acids 552–880 fused to the Gal4 activation domain showed similarly high levels of expression, i.e. ∼80% of wild type. To test if ZnF1 and/or ZnF2 are important for DNA binding, the GAD-Zap1642–880 fusion was constructed in which these two fingers are deleted. Although expression is somewhat diminished relative to the larger fusion proteins, this allele retained high levels of expression suggesting that these fingers are not necessary for DNA binding. The small reduction in expression is most likely caused by the removal of a Zap1 activation domain located within the 552–642 region.5 Thus, deletions eliminating the NH2-terminal 640 amino acids of Zap1 can bind DNA in vivo. In contrast, the GAD-Zap1687–880 fusion produced only about 20% of wild type expression levels. These results are consistent with at least two models. First, the ZRE binding activity of this Zap1 fragment may be partially impaired by deletion of the region from amino acids 642–686. Alternatively, fusion of the Gal4 activation domain close to the Zap1 DNA binding domain may inhibit the function of either domain perhaps through steric interference. An additional fusion, GAD-Zap1Δ553–686 in which the 642–686 region in question was deleted from the full-length protein, was constructed to address these models. This fusion showed wild typelacZ expression, indicating that the region of Zap1 from 642 to 686 is not required for DNA binding activity. Thus, the reduced ability of GAD-Zap1687–880 to complement the growth defect of the zap1Δ mutant is due to reasons other than deletion of important DNA binding domain function. To determine which of the Zap1 zinc fingers are required for specific ZRE binding, we used site-directed mutagenesis to convert the two conserved histidine Zn2+ligands in each finger to glutamines (Fig. 1). These mutations impair Zn2+ binding in these sites and therefore interfere with proper formation of the zinc finger structures. The mutations were introduced into a fusion allele in which the amino acid 552–880 region of Zap1 was fused at its amino terminus to the Gal4 DNA binding domain (GBD). This domain was included to provide both an epitope tag and a nuclear localization signal for these proteins, and for future studies of Zap1 zinc responsiveness. When expressed in zinc-limitedzap1Δ mutant cells, GBD-Zap1552–880 induced a high level of expression from the ZRE-lacZ reporter (Fig.4 A). Mutation of zinc fingers 1 (mZnF1) or 2 (mZnF2) individually or both ZnF1 and 2 together (mZnF1/2) resulted in no loss of expression, supporting the hypothesis that these domains are not required for DNA binding. In fact,lacZ expression in each of these mutants was increased by 50–100% relative to the corresponding wild type protein fragment, suggesting that these mutations may increase activation domain function under these conditions. Similar mutations in ZnF3, ZnF4, ZnF5, ZnF6, or ZnF7 resulted in complete loss of ZRE-lacZ expression. Although the simplest interpretation of these results is that each of these zinc fingers is required for DNA binding, a number of other explanations were also possible. For example, these mutant proteins may be unstable and fail to accumulate. Immunoblot analysis of total protein samples prepared from these strains demonstrated that this is not the case (Fig. 4 B). All of the GBD-Zap1 proteins accumulated to similar levels. We did note that the nonfunctional GBD-Zap1 fusions also accumulated as lower mobility forms that may represent homo- or heteromultimeric complexes of the protein that are not disrupted by SDS-PAGE. Another explanation for the inactivity of these mutant proteins is that they fail to accumulate in the nucleus despite the presence of the Gal4 nuclear localization signal. To test this hypothesis, we examined their intracellular distribution by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using an anti-GBD antibody. Little cell-associated fluorescence was observed in untransformed cells or vector-only controls, whereas the GBD-Zap1 fusions were easily detectable (Fig. 4 C, data not shown). The wild type (Fig.4 C), mZnf1, mZnf2, and mZnF1/2 (data not shown) GBD fusions clearly localized in the nucleus. Mutants mZnF3 and mZnF7 were largely present in the nucleus, and fluorescence was also visible in the cytoplasm as punctate spots of apparently aggregated protein. In the mZnF4, mZnF5, and mZnF6 mutants, the proteins were mostly visible as cytoplasmic aggregates and little nuclear staining was observed. We can conclude from this analysis that ZnF3 and Znf7 are likely required for DNA binding; these proteins accumulate in the nucleus in substantial amounts but fail to activate transcription. However, it was not possible to assess if mZnF4, mZnF5, or mZnF6 could bind to a ZRE,i.e. their failure to activate in vivo could simply be due to the inability to accumulate in the nucleus. Finally, it is intriguing that all of the mutant forms of Zap1 that are seen as cytoplasmic aggregates also appear in lower mobility forms on SDS-PAGE, suggesting that their may be a link between these observations. To complement thisin vivo analysis, in vitro DNA binding studies using purified recombinant Zap1 protein were performed. Various Zap1 truncate and mutant proteins were expressed in E. coli as NH2-terminal GST fusions and purified using GSH-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Attempts to purify full-length Zap1 were unsuccessful because of the formation of insoluble inclusion bodies. However, GST-Zap1538–880, GST-Zap1611–880, and GST-Zap1687–880 were isolated, and each contains the functional DNA-binding domain (ZnF3–ZnF7) implicated by our in vivo studies. These GST-Zap1 fusion proteins were largely soluble in E. coli. The Zn2+ content of GST-Zap1538–880 was found to be approximately 5 mol eq (Table I), suggesting metal occupancy of only five of the seven possible zinc finger domains in this protein. No significant quantities of Cu or Fe ions were observed in the purified samples.Table IZinc stoichiometry and ZRE binding affinities of purified Zap1 fusions and zinc finger mutants mZnF1/2–mZnF7 constructed in GST-Zap1552–880 fusionsProteinZincK dmol eqnmGST-Zap1538–8804.8 ± 0.72.1 ± 2.5GST-Zap1611–880NMaNM, not measured; ND, no binding detected.1.95bSingle measurement.GST-Zap1687–8803.9 ± 1.21.2, 3.0Zap1538–8804.3bSingle measurement.3.5bSingle measurement.mZnF1/25.8, 4.93.5 ± 0.7mZnF33.9bSingle measurement.>500mZnF44.1bSingle measurement.>500mZnF54.2, 3.9>500mZnF65.1, 4.1NDaNM, not measured; ND, no binding detected.mZnF75.7, 4.8>500a NM, not measured; ND, no binding detected.b Single measurement. Open table in a new tab Binding of these purified Zap1 proteins to a functional ZRE was analyzed by EMSA. Each protein bound specifically to a ZRE-containing oligonucleotide (Fig. 5). ZRE sequence specificity was demonstrated by the lack of protein-DNA complex formation using a mutant DNA oligonucleotide lacking the intact ZRE element (M2, Ref. 8.Zhao H. Butler E. Rodgers J. Spizzo T. Duesterhoeft S. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28713-28720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The apparent dissociation constant (K d) for the GST-Zap1538–880fusion protein-ZRE complex was determined to be approximately 2 nm (Fig. 5 A, Table I). Protein-DNA complex formation was not lost with addition of ≤0.3 mg ml−1 poly(dI/dC) (data not shown). GST-Zap1538–880 protein forms two complexes with DNA in EMSA (Fig. 5 B), perhaps indicative of limited proteolysis that does not affect DNA binding. Alternatively, we may be observing different oligomeric states of the Zap1 protein and this is currently under investigation. Removal of the GST fragment by thrombin cleavage of the GST-Zap1 fusion did not greatly alter the affinity of Zap1 for the ZRE duplex (Table I). Furthermore, the affinity was also not altered by further purification of the fusion on a ZRE-DNA affinity column. Thus, the GST-Zap1 fusions appear to be predominantly active for DNA binding. The two other Zap1 truncates also showed high affinity ZRE binding interactions. Both GST-Zap1687–880 (Fig. 5, Cand D) and GST-Zap1611–880 (Table I) bind specifically to the ZRE duplex with affinities similar to the longer GST-Zap1538–880 protein. The complex formed with GST-Zap1687–880 was not disrupted by addition of ≤0.3 mg ml−1 poly(dI/dC). The high affinity ZRE binding of Zap1687–880 containing only ZnF3–ZnF7 suggested that mutation of fingers 1 and 2 would not disrupt DNA binding. A mutant form of GST-Zap1 was purified in which zinc fingers 1 and 2 contained the same histidine to glutamine substitutions as were analyzed in vivo. The GST-Zap1552–880 mZnF1/2 mutant protein bound DNA with a similar degree of ZRE specificity and affinity as did the wild type GST-Zap1538–880 protein (Fig. 5, E andF, Table I). Mutation of any one of zinc fingers 3–7 resulted in the loss of this specific interaction with ZREs. These mutant proteins bound the ZRE duplex with a low affinity in the high nanomolar to low micromolar concentration range indicative of only low affinity interactions. Most of these zinc finger mutant proteins bound on average one less Zn2+ atom per molecule than the wild type protein (Table I). The reason why mZnF6 and mZnF7 may retain a 5 mol eq Zn2+ stoichiometry is not yet clear. Perhaps mutation of these fingers allow for Zn2+ binding to alternate ligands in these domains. Finally, two Zap1 truncates lacking portions of the protein's COOH terminus were purified and evaluated. These two truncates remove either 55 (GST-Zap1552–825) or 83 (GST-Zap1552–797) COOH-terminal residues. Both of these proteins exhibited low affinity for the ZRE duplex with apparent K d values in the micromolar concentration range. GST-Zap1552–825 and GST-Zap1552–797 bind ZREs only at protein concentrations >20 nm, and, in each case, complex formation was abolished with the addition of 0.04 mg ml−1 poly(dI/dC) (data not shown). The fully functional DNA binding domain of Zap1 maps to the carboxyl-terminal 194 amino acids of Zap1, i.e. residues 687–880. Fusion of this region to the Gal4 activation domain complemented a zap1Δ mutation for growth under zinc-limiting conditions and conferred expression from a ZRE-lacZ reporter gene in vivo. In vitro, a purified 687–880 fragment and a much longer fragment with amino acids 538 (or 552)-880 bound to a ZRE-containing duplex oligonucleotide with high affinity. The dissociation constant of this interaction was estimated to be in the 0.8–4 nm range. Region 687–880 contains five of the seven zinc finger domains found in Zap1 (Fig. 1). All seven of the Zap1 fingers fit the zinc finger consensus sequence and are predicted to form the ββα structure found for other such domains. Zinc finger proteins bind to DNA through a generally conserved docking arrangement with each finger α-helix fitting into the major groove of the DNA double helix (17.Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar, 18.Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1993; 261: 1701-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Residues −1, 2, 3, and 6 (numbering with respect to the start of the α-helix) typically make key base contacts that are responsible for the sequence specificity of the interaction. Thus, each zinc finger commonly recognizes a 4-base subsite that can overlap the recognition site of an adjacent finger by 1 base. These considerations raise a question regarding which fingers of Zap1 contact DNA. Mutagenesis studies reported here demonstrate that all five zinc fingers are required for DNA binding, yet the 11-base pair ZRE sequence predicts that at most only three or four of these are involved in site-specific interactions. For example, three fingers in transcription factor IIIA are sufficient to recognize an 11-base pair binding site (19.Nolte R.T. Conlin R.M. Harrison S.C. Brown R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2938-2943Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Structural studies of the GLI zinc finger protein may explain this paradox (18.Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1993; 261: 1701-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Like Zap1, GLI contains five tandem zinc fingers that are required for DNA binding. Although GLI zinc fingers 2 through 5 bind in the major groove, finger 1 does not contact DNA but rather makes extensive protein-protein interactions with finger 2. For Zap1, a similar structure may exist with ZnF4–ZnF7 making major groove contacts and ZnF3 making protein-protein contacts analogous to GLI finger 1. Alternatively, Zap1 ZnF3 may make nonspecific DNA contacts with the phosphate backbone. The hypothesis that Zap1 has a protein-DNA complex structure similar to that of GLI is supported by examining the sequences and lengths of the spacer regions between the fingers. Adjacent zinc fingers known or predicted to make major groove contacts are typically separated by a linker with the consensus sequence (T/S)-G-E-(R/K)-P (6.Turner J. Crossley M. Trends Biol. Sci. 1999; 24: 236-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 17.Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1991; 252: 809-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1709) Google Scholar, 18.Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O. Science. 1993; 261: 1701-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar). Sequences that precisely match this consensus separate Zap1 ZnF5 and ZnF6, and ZnF6 and ZnF7, whereas a closely related sequence, SKYKP, separates ZnF4 and ZnF5 (Fig. 1). The presence of these conserved linker sequences suggests that ZnF4–ZnF7 make major groove contacts. A very different linker in terms of both sequence and length, LTRGKSE, separates ZnF3 and ZnF4, suggesting that ZnF3 does not bind in the major groove. The preceding discussion assumes that Zap1 binds to DNA as a monomer, as is commonly found among zinc finger proteins. However, if Zap1 binds as a dimer, as is predicted by the palindromic nature of the ZRE (7.Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1997; 15: 5358-5369Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 8.Zhao H. Butler E. Rodgers J. Spizzo T. Duesterhoeft S. Eide D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28713-28720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), perhaps as few as two fingers of each monomer make major groove contacts. The other fingers may form a dimer interface (7.Sun L. Liu A. Georgopoulos K. EMBO J. 1997; 15: 5358-5369Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar) or make phosphate backbone DNA contacts. Significant progress has been made recently in devising a protein-DNA recognition code for zinc finger proteins like Zif268 (13.Wolfe S.A. Greisman H.A. Ramm E.I. Pabo C.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1917-1934Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Such a code, in which the identity of DNA contacting residues can be predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the recognition site, andvice versa, would be extremely useful for designing zinc finger proteins that bind specifically to target DNA sequences. Attempts to apply the current recognition codes to predict which fingers of Zap1 bind to which bases of the ZRE have yet to provide unambiguous results. Surprisingly, our results demonstrate that Zap1 ZnF1 and ZnF2 are not required for high affinity ZRE binding. Either deletion of these two finger domains or site-directed mutagenesis such that they could no longer bind Zn2+ failed to reduce the ability of Zap1 to function in vivo or bind to DNA in vitro. Furthermore, our results suggest that ZnF1 and ZnF2 bind Zn2+ with lower affinity than do the other five Zap1 finger domains. GST-Zap1538–880 contains 5 mol eq of Zn2+ when purified from E. coli and mutation of ZnF1 and ZnF2 had no effect on this stoichiometry. One explanation for their apparent lower affinity for Zn2+ is suggested by the sequence of these two fingers. Most zinc fingers have a hydrophobic residue located in a turn between β2 and the α-helix that provides part of a stabilizing hydrophobic core at the “tip” of each finger. For Zap1 ZnF3–ZnF7, this residue is a phenylalanine (Fig. 1). However, ZnF1 has a cysteine and ZnF2 has a glycine in the corresponding position, and neither of these residues would provide this important hydrophobic interaction. What role then do these two fingers play in Zap1 function? One potential function is as Zn2+ sensors; Zap1 binds to DNA and activates transcription under low zinc conditions, but this activity is repressed in high zinc. Although the precise mechanism of this regulation is unknown, we postulate that Zap1 is the primary zinc sensor and that binding of the metal to lower affinity sites in the protein repress its activation function. The apparently low affinity of ZnF1 and ZnF2 for Zn2+ suggests that these two fingers may be regulatory rather than structural components. In this regard, it is intriguing that ZnF1 and ZnF2 are found within an activation domain of Zap1; perhaps, binding of Zn2+ to these fingers may control the activity of this domain. The observation that ZnF1 and ZnF2 mutations increase ZRE-lacZ expression (Fig. 4 A) are consistent with this model. Ongoing studies are addressing this hypothesis and further characterizing the roles of the zinc fingers in Zap1 function."

The start of DNA synthesis de novo occurs by two independent processes: the singular priming event on the leading strand at the origin and the multiple priming steps for Okazaki fragment synthesis on the lagging strand.

Two cell-free initiation reactions have served as model systems to investigate these processes, primer synthesis in the cell-free SV40 DNA replication system and primer synthesis on natural single-stranded (ss) DNA templates bound by replication protein A (RPA) (17.Brush G.S.

Using these cell-free systems, it was shown that the initiation of SV40 DNA replication at the origin is species-specific and requires the activity of the p180 subunit of primate pol-prim (19.Murakami Y.

In contrast to these results, the initiation of Okazaki fragments during lagging strand DNA synthesis is not species-specific and the human as well as the bovine pol-prim can perform lagging strand initiation equally well (20.Schneider C.

Moreover, the host-specific DNA replication of the mouse polyomavirus (PyV), which is closely related to SV40, is mediated by p48 of mouse pol-prim rather than by the p180 subunit as for the primate system (22.Brückner A.

These results suggest that in eukaryotes the initiation of leading and lagging strand synthesis may be mechanistically distinct and regulated by different means. Indeed, in eukaryotic cells leading strand initiation at an origin of replication must occur once and only once per cell cycle to avoid re-replication of the genome (23.Diffley J.F. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2819-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 24.Li J.J. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 472-475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In contrast to this setting, DNA synthesis on the lagging strand needs multiple initiations of Okazaki fragments (25.Thömmes P. Hübscher U. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 194: 699-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The leading strand initiation of SV40 DNA replication in vitro requires double-stranded (ds) plasmid DNA with a viral origin of replication, the multifunctional viral Tag, the cellular topoisomerase I, and two cellular complexes, pol-prim and the eukaryotic ssDNA-binding protein, RPA (1.Waga S.

It is believed that these protein-protein interactions are important for the observed stimulation of both the primase and DNA polymerase activity by Tag as well as for the increased origin DNA binding activity of Tag in the presence of pol-prim (18.Collins K.L.

Complex formation between the p70 subunit of RPA and the heterodimeric primase consisting of p58 and p48 subunits has been demonstrated, and the p48 subunit on its own seemed to be sufficient for this interaction (29.Dornreiter I.

Biol. 1991; 11: 2108-2115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Schneider C. Weisshart K. Guarino L.A. Dornreiter I. Fanning E. Mol. Cell.

Hurwitz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9712-9716Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, the primase activity of pol-prim is severely inhibited on M13 ssDNA that is bound by RPA, an inhibition that can be relieved by Tag (18.Collins K.L. Kelly T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2108-2115Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Schneider C. Weisshart K. Guarino L.A. Dornreiter I. Fanning E. Mol. Cell.

Therefore, it is thought that the coordinated oligoribonucleotide synthesis by pol-prim on M13 ssDNA in the presence of RPA and Tag in vitro resembles the initiation of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand in vivo. To investigate the mechanism of Okazaki fragment synthesis on the lagging strand, we compared the ability of heterotetrameric pol-prim and heterodimeric primase (prim2) to synthesize primers on natural ssDNA in the above mentioned model system in vitro. In contrast to the initiation at SV40 origins, prim2 substitutes for the pol-prim in an assay containing ssDNA, Tag, and RPA. Physical interactions of Tag with primase and RPA are required for efficient oligoribonucleotide synthesis on the lagging strand in the cell-free system. Here, we show that the primase subunits p58-p48 directly contact the viral initiator protein Tag. Since only the four-subunit pol-prim can start DNA replication de novoat the SV40 origin of replication, these data suggest that the initiation of leading and lagging strand synthesis are mechanistically different. SV40 T antigen, RPA, the primase (p58-p48, prim2), and the DNA polymerase α-primase (pol-prim) complex (p180-p68-p58-p48) were purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells as described (22.Brückner A.

Rat monoclonal antibodies RAC-3D5 and RAC-4D9 against the p70 subunit of RPA and PRI-5G6 and PRI-8G10 against primase subunits p58 and p48, respectively, were produced according to standard procedures by using recombinant proteins for immunization and screening. A polyclonal rabbit serum specific for the three RPA subunits was produced by immunizing rabbits with a mix of subunits fused to maltose binding proteins (67.Kolpashchikov D.M. Weisshart K.

Primer-synthesis was carried out in an assay (40 μl) containing 30 mmHepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 7 mm MgAc, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.25 mg/ml BSA, 0.01 mg/ml creatine kinase, 40 mm creatine phosphate, 4 mm ATP, 0.2 mm each of GTP and UTP, 0.002 mm CTP, 2 μl of [α-32P]CTP (specific activity 3000 Ci/mmol, 10 μCi/μl; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Freiburg), 250 ng (0.76 nmol of nucleotides) of M13mp18 ssDNA template (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and, if not otherwise stated, 6 pmol of monomeric Tag (0.56 μg) and 6 pmol of RPA (0.69 μg). The reaction mixture was assembled on ice, and the reaction was started by the addition of pol-prim, and prim2, respectively, as indicated. For antibody inhibition studies, 5 μg of the respective antibody was added to the reaction before addition of 2.5 pmol of either pol-prim (0.88 μg) or prim2 (0.27 μg), and the reaction was incubated 15 min on ice. After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, one eighth of the reaction was used to estimate the amount of incorporated nucleotides by spotting the reaction mixture onto DE-81 paper (68.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The rest of the reaction was stopped by the addition of 6.4 μl of S buffer (6.25 mg/ml tRNA, 62.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mLiCl). The material was ethanol-precipitated and resuspended in 50 μl of DL buffer (35% formamide, 8 mm EDTA, 0.005% bromphenol blue). The sample was heated at 65 °C for 30 min and stored at −20 °C. Prior to loading, the sample was heated for 2 min at 95 °C and applied to a 20% denaturing urea gel in TBE (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 0.2 mmEDTA). The gel was run at 600 V until the bromphenol blue marker had migrated about two thirds into the gel. The wet gel was then exposed to an x-ray film at −80 °C using intensifier screens.

After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the samples were treated as described under “Primer Synthesis Assays on M13 ssDNA.” Unwinding assays (end volume, 15 μl) contained 30 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 7 mm MgAc, 0.1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.25 mg/ml BSA, 0.01 mg/ml creatine kinase, 40 mm creatine phosphate, 4 mm ATP, 6 pmol of RPA, 6 pmol of Tag, the indicated amounts of pol-prim or prim2, 10 fmol (approximately 20 ng) ofXmnI-restricted 5′ end-labeled linear pUCHS DNA with blunt ends (fragment length, approximately 3000 base pairs) or 100 fmol of (approximately 200 ng) supercoiled pUCHS (69.Weisshart K. Taneja P. Fanning E. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 9771-9781Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction was assembled on ice and started by addition of Tag. Then the reaction was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. To stop the reaction, proteinase K, EDTA, and SDS were added to final concentrations of 0.3 mg/ml, 6 mm, and 0.3%, respectively, and the sample was incubated for another 1 h. Using linear DNA, 0.2 volume of 5× loading buffer (30 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 25% Ficoll 400, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 1% SDS) was added and the sample was applied to a 1% agarose gel in TAE. The gel was dried and exposed to x-ray films, and quantified by phosphorimaging. Proteins were expressed either in insect cells with recombinant baculoviruses or in bacteria (20.Schneider C.

Cells were resuspended in one cell volume of I buffer (50 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40). Insect cells were lysed by incubation for 10 min on ice, whereas bacterial cells were sonicated. After homogenizing the cells, debris were removed by centrifugation at 10,000 × g. The protein concentrations of the extracts were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit using BSA as the standard according to the manufacturer's protocol. Protein concentrations of insect cell extracts were 10–20 mg/ml, and 20–40 mg/ml for bacterial cell extracts. According to the efficiencies of expression, the following amounts of cell extracts were used: 50 μg for Tag, 200 μg for pol-prim, 200 or 50 μg for the prim2 expressed in insect or bacterial cells, respectively; and 500 or 50 μg for RPA expressed in insect or bacterial cells, respectively (one fifth of these amounts was loaded on the SDS gel as input control). After mixing the extracts, the total volume was adjusted to 200 μl with I buffer. In case of the baculovirus system, partner proteins were also co-expressed in insect cells. Approximately 200 μg of cell extracts were used in the following steps. In some cases a benzonase nuclease mixture (Merck) was added to the reaction at 0.05 units/μl to exclude indirect interaction between the proteins due to association with DNA. The extracts were supplemented with the respective monoclonal antibody (10 μg) or 10 μl of polyclonal serum specific for one of the interacting proteins. Then, 20 μl of protein G-agarose beads (50% (v/v)) equilibrated in I buffer were added and the mixture rotated at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were then centrifuged, and the supernatant was discarded. The beads were washed six times with 1 ml of I buffer. Finally, the beads were resuspended in 40 μl of sample buffer and bound proteins separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Proteins were blotted to nitrocellulose membranes and detected by ECL. To avoid cross-reaction with antibodies derived in mouse and rabbits used for immunoprecipitations, we applied monoclonal rat antibodies and a secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled anti-rat antibody preadsorbed to mouse and rabbit IgG (Dianova) to detect the proteins. In case of Tag, PAb419 was directly coupled to HRP according to the supplie"

Mutation of a tryptophan located directly below the heme (Trp409) to Phe or Tyr causes hyperactive NO synthesis and less heme-NO complex buildup in the steady state (Adak, S., Crooks, C., Wang, Q., Crane, B. R., Tainer, J. A., Getzoff, E. D., and Stuehr, D. J. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 26907–26911). To understand the mechanism, we used conventional and stopped flow spectroscopy to compare kinetics of heme-NO complex formation, enzyme activity prior to and after complex formation, NO binding affinity, NO complex stability, and its reaction with O2 in mutants and wild type nNOS. During the initial phase of NO synthesis, heme-NO complex formation was 3 and 5 times slower in W409F and W409Y, and their rates of NADPH oxidation were 50 and 30% that of wild type, probably due to slower heme reduction. NO complex formation slowed NADPH oxidation in the wild type by 7-fold but reduced mutant activities less than 2-fold, giving mutants higher final activities. NO binding kinetics were similar among mutants and wild type, although in ferrous W409Y (and to a lesser extent W409F) the 436-nm NO complex converted to a 417-nm NO complex with time. Oxidation of the ferrous heme-NO complex to ferric enzyme was 7 times faster in Trp409 mutants than in wild type. Thus, mutant hyperactivity derives from slower formation and faster decay of the heme-NO complex. Together, these minimize partitioning into the NO-bound form.

NO complex formation slowed NADPH oxidation in the wild type by 7-fold but reduced mutant activities less than 2-fold, giving mutants higher final activities. NO binding kinetics were similar among mutants and wild type, although in ferrous W409Y (and to a lesser extent W409F) the 436-nm NO complex converted to a 417-nm NO complex with time. Oxidation of the ferrous heme-NO complex to ferric enzyme was 7 times faster in Trp409 mutants than in wild type. Thus, mutant hyperactivity derives from slower formation and faster decay of the heme-NO complex. Together, these minimize partitioning into the NO-bound form. neuronal NO synthase oxygenase domain of nNOS calmodulin 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazinepropanesulfonic acid (6R)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-l-biopterin nitric oxide wild type Neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS)1 functions in neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, peristalsis, excitotoxicity, and neurodegenerative diseases (1.Garthwaite J.

The enzyme generates nitric oxide (NO) by catalyzing a two-step oxidation of l-Arg that utilizes NADPH and O2 as cosubstrates (4.Marletta M.A. Hurshman A.R. Rusche K.M. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1998; 2: 656-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). nNOS is composed of a C-terminal reductase domain that contains binding sites for FMN, FAD, and NADPH and an N-terminal oxygenase domain that contains binding sites for heme, tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B), andl-Arg (5.Stuehr D.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Bioenerg. 1999; 1411: 217-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). A calmodulin (CaM) binding site lies between the two domains. CaM binds in response to elevated Ca2+ and triggers NADPH-dependent heme reduction (6.Abu-Soud H.M. Yoho L.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

As in the cytochrome P-450s, the nNOS heme iron is ligated to a cysteine thiolate and can bind a variety of molecules besides O2 (7.Abu-Soud H.M. Gachhui R. Raushel F.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

This markedly reduces its steady-state activity and increases the apparent K m(O2) (15.Abu-Soud H.M. Rousseau D.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

Although the ferrous NO complex of nNOS is stable under inert atmosphere whenl-Arg and H4B are bound, it decays in the presence of O2 to form ferric NOS, which can again participate in NO synthesis. Mechanisms that control nNOS partitioning between its active and NO-bound forms are a topic of current interest. In rat nNOS, a conserved tryptophan (Trp409) that is located on the distal side of the heme has been implicated in this process (16.Adak S. Crooks C. Wang Q. Crane B.R. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26907-26911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, substitution of Trp409 with Tyr or Phe generated hyperactive mutants that had greater rates of NO synthesis and NADPH consumption than wild type nNOS. From this work, it appeared that mutant hyperactivity was associated with less NO complex formation in the steady state. However, it is unclear why this occurs and how it might be regulated by Trp409. To address these questions, we compared the Trp409 mutants and wild type nNOS in a number of ways using conventional and stopped flow spectroscopy. We analyzed heme-NO complex formation during catalysis and upon reaction with reagent NO, determined complex stability and O2 reactivity, and measured electron flux through the enzymes prior to and after NO complex formation. Our results explain how Trp409 controls NO complex formation in nNOS and identify a basis for mutant hyperactivity. Oxygen and NO gas were purchased from Liquid Carbonic Company and Matheson Inc., respectively. All other reagents and materials were obtained from Sigma or sources as previously reported (16.Adak S.

Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing at the Cleveland Clinic core facility.

UV-visible spectra were recorded on a Hitachi U3110 Spectrophotometer in the absence or presence of 20 μm H4B and 1 mml-Arg. The ferrous CO adduct absorbing at 444 nm was used to quantitate the heme protein content using an extinction coefficient of 74 mm−1cm−1(A 444–A 500). For experiments done in the presence of an NADPH regenerating system, an air saturated solution that contained 40 mm EPPS buffer, pH 7.6, 3 μm nNOS protein, 0.5 mm EDTA, 6 μm CaM, 200 μm dithiothreitol, 20 μm H4B, 30 μm NADPH, 0.5 unit of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 0.5 mm glucose 6-phosphate was rapidly mixed at 10 °C with an equal volume of 2.4 mm Ca2+ in buffer. Reactions were monitored with a Hi-Tech Ltd. rapid scanning diode array detector (MG6000) designed to collect 96 spectra in a specific time frame. For experiments done without an NADPH-regenerating system, an air-saturated solution that contained 40 mm EPPS, pH 7.6, 2 μm nNOS protein, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mml-Arg, 20 μm H4B, 4 μm CaM, 100 μm NADPH, and 0.5 mm EDTA was rapidly mixed at 10 °C with an equal volume of buffer containing 2.4 mm Ca2+. Absorbance change at 436 nm (ferrous NO formation and decay) and at 340 nm (NADPH oxidation) were monitored separately in a Hi-Tech Ltd. 51MX stopped flow instrument equipped with a variable wavelength detector. The concentration of ferrous NO complex formed during NO synthesis was estimated from absorbance change at 436 nm using an extinction coefficient of 49,800 m−1cm−1 (14.Abu-Soud H.M. Wang J.

Signal/noise ratios were improved by averaging 4–6 individual experiments. Each experiment was performed three separate times. The time courses of absorbance change were fit using methods provided by the instrument manufacturer. Spectra were collected with the rapid scanning diode array detector. Anaerobic solutions containing wild type or mutant nNOS oxygenase domains (nNOSox; 3 μm), 100 mm EPPS buffer, pH 7.6, 1 mml-Arg, 10 μm H4B, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol were prereduced with excess dithionite (100 μm) and then rapidly mixed with NO-saturated buffer at 10 °C. To study NO binding kinetics, full-length nNOS proteins were used, the initial NO concentration was varied by diluting the saturated solution with anaerobic buffer, and absorbance change was recorded with a single wavelength detector. Anaerobic solutions of full-length nNOS enzymes (4 μm) containing saturating l-Arg and H4B were reduced with a minimum amount of dithionite, and then saturated NO solution was added to give an NO concentration of 0.1 mm. This solution was transferred to the stopped flow reservoir and rapidly mixed with air-saturated buffer solutions at 10 °C. Spectra were collected with the rapid scanning diode array detector. In replica experiments absorbance changes at 436 and 393 nm were monitored using a single wavelength detector. An anaerobic buffer solution containing 3 μm W409Y oxygenase domain (W409Yox), l-Arg, and H4B in a cuvette had NO-saturated solution added to form the ferric NO complex. This was transferred to the stopped flow instrument and rapid mixed at 10 °C with a 0.1 mm dithionite solution. Scans were collected between 0 and 8 s. We utilized rapid scanning stopped flow spectroscopy to carefully compare heme-NO complex formation in the Trp409 mutants and wild type nNOS. In Fig. 1, air-saturated solutions containing enzyme, l-Arg, cofactors, and an NADPH-regenerating system were rapid mixed at 10 °C with an air-saturated solution containing excess Ca2+ to trigger NO synthesis. A majority (approximately 70–80%) of wild type nNOS converted to the ferrous NO complex as judged by buildup of heme Soret absorbance at 436 nm, a single broad visible band near 560 nm, and loss of absorbance at 395 nm, consistent with previous reports (14.Abu-Soud H.M.

Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32515-32518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In the W409F and W409Y mutants, there was much less partitioning into a heme-NO complex even at the beginning of the reaction. A majority of mutant enzymes remained ferric as judged by continued strong absorbance at 395 nm in both cases. These levels of NO complex were maintained for at least 150 s of the reaction in all cases. This confirms that the Trp409 mutants generate less heme-NO complex during steady state NO synthesis than wild type nNOS. In Fig. 2, reactions were similar except that they contained a limiting amount of NADPH and no regenerating system. Absorbance changes at 436 and 340 nm were monitoredversus time to follow NO complex formation and NADPH oxidation, respectively, and the results are shown at two different time scales. In all cases, the level of heme-NO complex reached a plateau within the first several seconds of the reaction and then began to decrease after most of the NADPH was oxidized. The peak concentrations of heme-NO complex for wild type, W409F, and W409Y were 0.60, 0.25, and 0.14 μm, respectively, as estimated from the absorbance gain at 436 nm (14.Abu-Soud H.M. Wang J.

This represents 60, 25, and 14% conversion of wild type, W409F, and W409Y into the heme-NO complex. For wild type and W409F, the buildup best fit to a two-exponential equation, whereas buildup in W409Y best fit to a single exponential equation (Table I). The percentage of absorbance change attributed to each phase (k 1and k 2) were the same in wild type and W409F (46 and 54%). The apparent k 1 values for W409F and W409Y were 3 and 5 times slower than for wild type, respectively, and the W409F k 2 value was 5 times slower.Table IRate constants for heme-NO complex buildup, NADPH oxidation, and NO complex decay during NO synthesisEnzymeBuildupNADPH oxidationk decayk 1k 2m 1m 2s −1δA340 s −1μm −1s −1nNOS10.42.10.0220.0032.5 × 10−2W409F3.40.380.0120.009NDW409Y2.0ND0.0060.005NDNO synthesis was initiated by Ca2+-dependent CaM binding in a stopped flow instrument at 10 °C.

The rate of NADPH oxidation prior to NO complex buildup was about 2- and 4-fold faster in wild type nNOS compared with W409F and W409Y (Fig.2; Table I). However, in wild type nNOS the NADPH oxidation rate was decreased 7-fold after heme-NO complex formation, whereas in the Trp409 mutants almost no change was observed (Fig. 2). This left the W409F and W409Y mutants with 3 and 1.7 times faster rates of NADPH oxidation after NO complex formation (Table I), consistent with their being hyperactive in the steady state. Fig.3 contains data from rapid scanning experiments where anaerobic ferrous enzymes containingl-Arg and H4B were rapidly mixed at 10 °C with an equal volume of NO saturated buffer. In wild type nNOS, a stable heme-NO complex formed with Soret absorbance at 436 nm and visible band at ∼560 nm, consistent with previous reports (13.Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J.

In W409F, a 436-nm NO complex was initially formed, but then a minority converted to a species with absorbance closer to 420 nm. In W409Y, two NO complexes with Soret absorbance at 417 and 436 nm were present even in the earliest scan after mixing (0.003 s), with the 417-nm complex predominant. More of the W409Y 436-nm complex converted to the 417-nm complex with time. As shown in the right panelsof Fig. 3, conversion to the 417-nm species was slow in W409F and about 25 times faster in W409Y. Subsequent air oxidation of the Trp409 NO complexes regenerated ferric enzymes that had normal NO synthesis activities (data not shown), indicating that conversion to the 417-nm species did not irreversibly inactivate the enzymes. To study the 417-nm complex in more detail, the ferric NO complex of W409Yox (which is stable; Ref. 16.Adak S. Crooks C. Wang Q. Crane B.R. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26907-26911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) was reacted with dithionite in the stopped flow instrument. As shown in Fig.4, the ferrous NO complex that initially formed has a broad visible absorbance with peak at 556 nm, essentially identical to the ferrous NO complex of wild type nNOS (see Fig. 3). However, after time this species converted to the 417-nm ferrous NO complex, which has two visible absorbance bands at 534 and 536 nm (Fig.4), This differs from the ferric NO complex of W409Y (Fig. 4) and from the five-coordinate ferrous NO complex of nNOS, which only forms in the absence of l-Arg and H4B and has a Soret absorbance at 392 nm and broad visible band at 570 nm (18.Huang L. Abu-Soud H.M. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1912-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, the spectrum of the 417-nm W409Y NO complex is similar to ferrous NO heme proteins that have a weakened transaxial bond (19.Ascenzi P. Brunori M. Coletta M. Desideri A. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 473-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20.Yoshimura T. Ozaki T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 229: 126-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), consistent with less hydrogen bonding to the cysteine thiolate in W409Y nNOS (16.Adak S. Crooks C. Wang Q. Crane B.R.

We next compared rates of NO binding to ferrous mutants and wild type nNOS. As shown in Fig. 5, graphs of the observed binding rates versus NO concentration were nearly identical in their concentration dependence and magnitude. This also held true for ferric nNOS proteins (data not shown). Thus, NO binding rates appear to be similar between the Trp409 mutants and wild type nNOS. Fig.6 contains spectral and kinetic data from experiments in which anaerobic ferrous NO enzyme solutions were rapidly mixed with an air-saturated solution. Overlay of consecutive scans (left panels) shows that a decrease in absorbance occurred between 415 and 445 nm and that an increase occurred between 360 and 410 nm as time progressed. These changes indicate concomitant decay of the heme-NO complex and generation of ferric enzyme, respectively. Cross-sections of absorbance change at 436 and 393 nm were monophasic in all cases and are shown in the right panels. Identical results were obtained for W409Y when NO complex decay was followed at 417 nm (data not shown). Analysis revealed that reaction rates with O2 (and rates of ferric enzyme formation) were about 7 times faster in the mutants compared with wild type nNOS (Table II).Table IIRates of ferrous-NO complex reaction with O2 and ferric enzyme formationEnzymeDecrease in ferrous-NO complexBuildup of ferric enzymes −1nNOS0.190.16W409F1.31.7W409Y1.41.2Anaerobic ferrous-NO enzymes were reacted with air-saturated solution in the stopped flow instrument at 10 °C.

The values are representative of two separate experiments. nNOS quickly reacts with self-generated NO during aerobic catalysis to partition between a catalytically active form and an inactive ferrous NO complex (14.Abu-Soud H.M.

We have incorporated partitioning into a two-cycle model for nNOS catalysis (Fig.7). The active and inactive cycles each have their own rate-limiting step that together determine the rate of NO synthesis during the steady-state. The rate-limiting step in the active cycle may be heme reduction (21.Gachhui R. Abu-Soud H.M. Ghosh D.K. Presta A. Blazing M.A. Mayer B. George S.E. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 16629-16635Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). After NO forms, its binding to ferric heme is fast and nearly quantitative (18.Huang L. Abu-Soud H.M. Hille R. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1912-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 28.Boggs S. Huang L. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2332-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and enough heme-NO complex is reduced prior to NO dissociation to form the ferrous NO complex. NO dissociation from the ferrous NO enzyme is slow, and the rate-limiting step appears to be its O2-dependent decay to generate ferric enzyme that can rejoin the active cycle (15.Abu-Soud H.M. Rousseau D.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32515-32518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Mutating Trp409 to Phe or Tyr caused hyperactivity that was associated with buildup of less NO complex during steady state NO synthesis (16.Adak S. Crooks C. Wang Q. Crane B.R. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26907-26911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). This suggested that Trp409 can control nNOS partitioning between the active and inactive forms in some way. We examined several steps that make up Fig. 7 to clarify a basis for the Trp409 effect. Our stopped flow data confirm that the mutant enzymes partition less into a NO complex even during the initial phase of NO synthesis. In the initial period, buildup of the ferrous NO complex was also slower in the mutants (Table I). The rate of complex buildup and maximum level can depend on many factors, including the intrinsic activity of the enzyme (k cat), degree of coupling between NADPH oxidation and NO synthesis, NO binding kinetics, NO scavenging, inherent stability of the heme-NO complex, and its reaction with O2. Our previous and current results suggest that there are little or no differences in some of these factors. For example, like wild type nNOS the mutant NO synthesis rates are insensitive to the NO scavenger oxyhemoglobin and display a high degree of coupling with NADPH oxidation (16.Adak S. Crooks C. Wang Q. Crane B.R. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26907-26911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Mutants also exhibited no apparent difference in NO binding affinity compared with wild type (Fig. 5). Thus, we are left to consider differences ink cat, complex stability, and reactivity with O2. Tight coupling of NO synthesis and NADPH oxidation in mutants and wild type means that their initial rates of NADPH oxidation (measured before NO complex buildup) are good estimates of k cat. A comparison of m 1 values in Table I shows that W409F and W409Y have 2- and 4-fold slower k catthan wild type. The initial rates of NO complex formation display the same rank order as the k cat estimates (wild type > W409F > W409Y), implying that they are causally linked. However, the fact that NO complex formation rates exhibit greater fold differences than the k cat values indicate other factors must contribute. In W409Y, simultaneous formation of the 417-nm NO complex conceivably reduces buildup of its 436-nm NO complex, but this does not apply for W409F. Surprisingly, reaction of the ferrous NO complex with O2 was almost 7 times faster in the mutants than in wild type nNOS. Together, our results suggest that Trp409 mutants have less NO complex buildup due to the combined effect of a slowerk cat and a faster reaction of their ferrous NO complexes with O2. It is useful to consider how differences in these two parameters affect mutant enzyme function in the steady state. Although the mutants have slower k cat, by virtue of their partitioning less into a ferrous NO complex their steady-state rates of NO synthesis and NADPH oxidation end up being faster than wild type. Both mutants have the same rate of O2-dependent NO complex decay. Thus, a 2-fold difference in k cat may explain why steady state NO synthesis by W409Y is half as fast as W409F. The greater propensity of W409Y to form a 417-nm NO complex also helps explain why it builds up less 436-nm NO complex compared with W409F. In nNOS, a slower rate of heme reduction leads to a slower rate of NO synthesis (21.Gachhui R. Abu-Soud H.M. Ghosh D.K. Presta A. Blazing M.A. Mayer B. George S.E. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12337-12345Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The lower k cat values of the Trp409 mutants probably reflect a slower rate of heme reduction, as can be inferred from their initial rates of NADPH oxidation (Table I). This would also slow reduction of the ferric NO complex that forms as an initial product of catalysis (28.Boggs S. Huang L. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2332-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, buildup of the ferrous NO species is minimized during mutant NO synthesis by a slower formation rate and a faster rate of oxidation (Fig. 7). A slower rate of heme reduction probably derives from a mutational effect on heme, because reductase function in the Trp409 mutants is normal (16.Adak S. Crooks C. Wang Q. Crane B.R. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26907-26911Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Crystal structures indicate that Trp409 stacks with the heme porphyrin and makes a hydrogen bond between its indole nitrogen and the heme cysteine thiolate ligand (24.Crane B.R. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. Tainer J.A. Science. 1998; 279: 2121-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar, 25.Fischmann T.O. Hruza A. DaNiu X. Fossetta J.D. Lunn C.A. Dolphin E. Prongay A.J. Paul R. Lundell D.J. Narula S.K. Weber P.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). This hydrogen bond is expected to modulate heme iron electronegativity. Mutating Trp409 to Phe and Tyr removes the hydrogen bond and probably lowers the heme potential, which is known to impede heme reduction in nNOS (26.Presta A. Weber-Main A.M. Stankovich M.T. Stuehr D.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 9460-9465Crossref Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Whether this also explains why mutant ferrous NO complexes react so much faster with O2 is unclear. Our spectral work suggests that Trp409 mutants do form altered ferrous NO complexes compared with wild type, and we are currently investigating if a causal relationship exists between heme electronegativity and ferrous NO complex reactivity. Our data impact on a fundamental aspect of nNOS, namely the binding of NO during normal aerobic catalysis (14.Abu-Soud H.M. Wang J. Rousseau D.L. Fukuto J. Ignarro L.J. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22997-23006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 27.Hurshman A.R. Marletta M.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5627-5634Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The ferrous heme-NO complex is catalytically inactive and its formation causes nNOS to operate at a fraction of its true activity. We suggested earlier that NO complex formation controls the rate of NO synthesis during the steady state by setting up a condition in which the O2-dependent breakdown of the ferrous NO complex becomes the rate-limiting step (15.Abu-Soud H.M. Rousseau D.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32515-32518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Our current results support this model and help explain how Trp409 mutants alter nNOS partitioning between active and inactive forms by affecting rates of heme reduction, NO synthesis, and NO complex decay. Oxidation of the ferrous NO complex by O2 is a key feature that promotes regeneration of ferric enzyme. Because NO complex formation dramatically affects nNOS K m(O2) (15.Abu-Soud H.M. Rousseau D.L. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32515-32518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar), it will be important to see if oxygen response is altered by the Trp409 mutations. We thank Drs. Kulwant Aulak and Susan Boggs for advice and Christine Curran for technical assistance."

Although mechanisms for regulating the life span of p53 have been described, there is growing evidence that transcriptional regulation of thep53 gene contributes significantly to controlling p53 protein levels and therefore the fate of a cell. However, the signal transduction pathways that lead to transcriptional activation of thep53 gene are poorly understood. The oncoprotein v-Maf and its cellular counterparts belong to the large combinatorially complex basic leucine zipper family of transcription factors, which include the AP1 family. To date few cellular targets of c-Maf have been identified. It is demonstrated here that v-Maf can bind as a homodimer to a variant Maf recognition element located between −66 and −54 upstream in the mouse p53 promoter. V-Maf and its cellular counterparts are shown to activate p53 expression through this site. The ability of v-Maf to activate p53 expression is modulated by AP1 family members. In addition, overexpression of v-Maf in primary cells leads to a p53-dependent cell death.

Kataoka K. Goto N. Fujiwara K. Kawai S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7711-7715Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Inoculation of this virus into newborn chickens induced tumors that were pathologically indistinguishable from the original tumor and when introduced into chicken embryo fibroblasts led to cellular transformation (1.Nishizawa M. Kataoka K. Goto N. Fujiwara K. Kawai S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7711-7715Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 2.Kawai S. Goto N. Kataoka K. Saegusa T. Shinno-Kohno H. Nishizawa M. Virology. 1992; 188: 778-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In human carcinogenesis, c-MAF was shown to be overexpressed in 25% of multiple myelomas tested due to the translocation of c-MAF to the IgH locus (3.Chesi M. Bergsagel P.L. Shonukan O.O. Martelli M.L. Brents L.A. Chen T. Schrock E. Ried T. Kuehl W.M. Blood. 1998; 91: 4457-4463Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A cellular homologue of v-maf, c-MAF type I, was identified in chickens. Comparison of the amino acid sequences revealed that the only differences between chicken c-MAF and v-Maf are the substitution at position 257 of a methionine residue for valine and the presence of the viral Gag sequence at the amino terminus (4.Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Kawai S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Comparison of the mouse, rat, and chicken c-Maf sequences shows them to be very highly conserved at the primary amino acid level. c-Maf was found to be but one member of an extended multigene family, members of which all share homology in a basic leucine zipper (b-Zip)1 motif, and hence form a distinct subgroup of the b-Zip family of transcription factors (5.Kerppola T.K. Curran T. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 675-684PubMed Google Scholar). Members of the Maf family are themselves divided into two subgroups as follows: the large Maf proteins c-Maf (4.Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Kawai S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), MafB (6.Sakai M. Imaki J. Yoshida K. Ogata A. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Kuboki Y. Nishizawa M. Nishi S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), and neural retina-specific leucine zipper (7.Swaroop A. Xu J. Pawar H. Jackson A. Skolnick C. Agarwal N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), and the small Maf proteins MafG (8.Kataoka K. Igarashi K. Itoh K. Fujiwara K.T. Noda M. Yamamoto M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar), MafF, and MafK (9.Fujiwara K.T. Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 2371-2380PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with being a member of the b-Zip family of transcription factors, c-Maf contains a typical acidic type transactivation domain in the amino terminus, and a carboxyl terminus consisting of a basic DNA binding domain and an adjacent leucine-rich region. This domain shares 20–30% homology with those of other b-Zip proteins (4.Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Kawai S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The leucine motif is somewhat atypical for b-Zip proteins as position 5 in the heptad repeat of hydrophobic residues is occupied by a tyrosine rather than a leucine residue. Maf is able to form homodimers through the leucine zipper motif, bind DNA, and transactivate promoter/reporter constructs in a sequence-specific manner (4.Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Kawai S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, the ability to form homodimers appears to be critical for v-Maf to transform primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (4.Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Kawai S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There are two known DNA consensus sequences bound by Maf homodimers, a 13-base pair 12-O-tetradecanoate-13-acetate-responsive element (TRE) type Maf recognition element (MARE) and a 14-base pair cAMP-responsive element (CRE) type MARE (10.Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The former MARE contains an AP1 (TGCTGACTCAGCA)-binding site, and the latter harbors a CRE (TGCTGACGTCAGCA) bound by members of CREB/ATF family of transcription factors (10.Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The various dimers formed among Maf family members and other b-Zip proteins have been shown to bind to MAREs and MARE-like sequences with varying affinities and with varying transactivation potentials (10.Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11.Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 53-62PubMed Google Scholar), creating a combinatorially complex and sensitive network of b-Zip transcription factors. c-MAF is widely expressed to modest levels in adult and embryonic tissues and highly expressed in some developing skeletal tissues (6.Sakai M. Imaki J. Yoshida K. Ogata A. Matsushima-Hibiya Y. Kuboki Y. Nishizawa M. Nishi S. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 745-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Currently, there are few cellular genes known to be transcriptionally regulated by Maf. One is the interleukin-4 (IL-4) gene (12.Ho I.-C. Hodge M.R. Rooney J.W. Glimcher L.H. Cell. 1996; 85: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). IL-4 is known to affect T helper cell subset ratios. The expression of c-Maf in the immune system has been shown to be specific to the T helper 2 (Th2) subset of T helper cells. Maf binds to a MARE-like element in the IL-4 promoter, resulting in increased expression and secretion of IL-4 by Th2 cells, causing the preferential differentiation of naive T cells into Th2 cells (12.Ho I.-C. Hodge M.R. Rooney J.W. Glimcher L.H. Cell. 1996; 85: 973-983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). Another known target gene for c-Maf is the L7 gene, which is expressed in all adult cerebellar Purkinje cells as well as in cells in certain functional domains of the developing nervous system. Mouse c-MAF was shown to activate transcription from two sites within the L7promoter in mouse cerebellar cells (13.Kurschner C. Morgan J.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In addition, induction of lens differentiation in the chicken was shown to be triggered by a lens-specific Maf that regulates multiple genes expressed in the lens (14.Ogino H. Yasuda K. Science. 1998; 280: 115-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). A data base search of sequence segments differing from the MARE by fewer than 5 base pairs revealed several other possible target genes for Maf, including the placental-type glutathioneS-transferase gene and the proto-oncogenes pim-1and c-erbB, although none of these has been confirmed (10.Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another possible gene target for Maf, which was also identified by the data base search, is the p53 tumor suppressor gene (10.Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Between −66 and −54 (all numbering is relative to the start site of transcription) in the mouse p53 promoter is a sequence that differs from the TRE-type MARE consensus sequence by only 2 base pairs. This region is completely conserved between the mouse and humanp53 promoters (Fig. 1, see Refs. 15.Bienz-Tadmor B. Zakut-Houri R. Libresco S. Givol D. Oren M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3209-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar and 16.Tuck S.P. Crawford L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2163-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The AP1 site within the p53 MARE (which differs by 1 base pair to the AP1 consensus sequence) has been designated the p53 factor 1 (PF1) site (17.Ginsberg D. Oren M. Yaniv M. Piette J. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1285-1290PubMed Google Scholar). This site is important in regulating p53 promoter activity (18.Kirch H.-C. Flaswinkel S. Rumpf H. Brockmann D. Esche H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2728-2738Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 19.Schreiber M. Kolbus A. Piu F. Szabowski A. Mohle-Steinlein U. Tian J. Karin M. Angel P. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 607-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar) and has been shown to bind several activities, some of which contain the AP1 components, c-Fos and c-Jun (18.Kirch H.-C. Flaswinkel S. Rumpf H. Brockmann D. Esche H. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2728-2738Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 19.Schreiber M. Kolbus A. Piu F. Szabowski A. Mohle-Steinlein U. Tian J. Karin M. Angel P. Wagner E.F. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 607-619Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). These observations led us to test the possibility that Maf could transcriptionally regulate the p53 gene. We demonstrate that v-Maf binds to the MARE-like site in the mouse p53 promoter and transactivates the p53 gene in a sequence-specific manner. Results show that overexpression of v-Maf causes cells to die in a p53-dependent manner. Furthermore, the ability of v-Maf to activate p53 expression is modulated by members of the AP1 family. Therefore, we conclude that a cellular target of the Maf transcription factor is the p53 gene and suggest that Maf has the potential to act as a “tumor suppressor” since it is able to induce cell death through its control of p53expression. The plasmid pCAT3M contains the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene but no eukaryotic promoter sequences upstream of this gene (20.Laimins L.A. Gruss P. Pozatti R. Khoury G. J. Virol. 1984; 49: 183-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pAACAT contains −224 to +116 of the mouse p53 promoter blunt-end cloned in front of the CAT gene in pCAT3M (15.Bienz-Tadmor B. Zakut-Houri R. Libresco S. Givol D. Oren M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3209-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The expression plasmids v-mafPT/pEFBssHII,ND5/pEFBssHII,CD3/pEFBssHII,CD4/pEFBssHII,R22E/pEFBssHII,L2PL4P/pEFBssHII,MAFB/pEFBssHII, c-MAF type I/pEFBssHII, and c-MAF type II/pEFBssHII were used to express the various Maf proteins and v-Maf mutants under the control of the human polypeptide chain elongation factor 1α (EF) promoter. These constructs are based on the expression vector pEFBssHII and are described in detail in Kataoka et al. (11.Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 53-62PubMed Google Scholar). pEF/luc expresses the firefly luciferase gene under control of the EF promoter and was created by cloning the firefly luciferase gene into the BssHII site of pEFBssHII. In the cytomegalovirus (CMV)-based plasmids, transcription is controlled by the immediate early enhancer-promoter of human CMV. pCMVE1b58 kDa expresses the adenovirus 2 E1b 58-kDa protein (21.Ridgway P. Soussi T. Braithwaite A.W. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7178-7187Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pCMVjun expresses rat c-Jun, and pCMVfosexpresses c-Fos (22.Cohen D.R. Ferreira P.C.P. Gentz R. Franza Jr., B.R. Curran T. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The construction of pCMVmfra2, which expresses mouse FRA-2, is described in McHenry et al. (23.McHenry J.Z. Leon A. Matthaei K.I. Cohen D.R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1131-1140Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). pCMVneo was used for selecting cells in the colony formation assay as it contains the Tn5 gene that encodes resistance to the neomycin family of antibiotics (24.Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341PubMed Google Scholar). pBR322 was used as the control plasmid in these assays. pCMVE1a (25.Morris G.F. Mathews M.B. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 6397-6406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) contains a genomic fragment of adenovirus early region 1 that encodes all the E1a proteins. pCMV280-390 encodes only the carboxyl-terminal region of p53 from amino acids 280 to 390 (26.Reed M. Wang Y. Mayr G. Anderson M.E. Schwedes J.F. Tegtmeyer P. Gene Exp. 1993; 3: 95-107PubMed Google Scholar). In order to create the reporter plasmid, pAAmut, that contains 4-base pair substitutions in the p53 MARE-like site present within pAACAT, the technique of inverse polymerase chain reaction was used (27.Imai Y. Matsushima Y. Sugimura T. Terada M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2785Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The following primer pairs were synthesized: 5′-TCCTC AAGTC CCGCC TCCAT TTC-3′ and 5′-GTCCT GATTC TCCCT GAGAT GTTGC-3′ (substitutions are underlined). Polymerase chain reaction was performed with 1 cycle at 96 °C for 3 min, followed by 25 cycles at 96 °C for 1 min, 67 °C for 15 s and 72 °C for 5 min, and then 1 cycle of 72 °C for 9 min in 50 μl of reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm (NH4)2SO4, 2–10 mm MgSO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 100 mm each of dNTPs, 10 ng of the template pAACAT, 40 pmol each of the primers, and 0.5 units of Vent DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs). The amplified linear DNA was agarose gel-purified, T4polynucleotide kinase-treated, and then a portion was self-ligated in 15 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT, 0.25 mm ATP, 30 mm KCl, 1 mm hexamine cobalt chloride, and 8 units of T4DNA ligase at 14 °C for 16 h and then used to transform competent Escherichia coli DH5 α cells. The substitutions within pAAmut were confirmed by sequencing. pRAM-GEM is a subclone of the v-maf gene based on the pGEM-4 vector, which was used to in vitro translate (IVT) v-Maf PT (4.Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Kawai S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The structure and construction of the deletion and point mutants of the v-maf PT gene used are based on pRAM-GEM and have been described previously (4.Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Kawai S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmids pSP6jun and pSP6fos (kindly provided by Dr. Donna Cohen, JCSMR, Canberra, Australia) were used to IVT rat c-Jun and c-Fos proteins, respectively. All plasmids were transcribed and translated in vitro using the TNT-coupled Wheat Germ Extract kit (Promega). The sequence of Oligomer M, which contains the mouse p53 MARE and flanking p53 promoter sequences, is shown in Fig.2 a. Also shown in Fig.2 a is the sequence of Oligomer Mmut that contains a mutant MARE. The sequence of Oligomer 11, which contains a MARE known to bind both the v-Maf PT and c-Jun homodimers and the c-Fos/c-Jun heterodimer (10.Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is 5′-GGGAG CTCGG AATTG ATGAC TCATC ATTAC TC-3′. Binding reactions were performed in a volume of 15 μl containing 6 μl of IVT product, 0.1–0.5 μg of poly(dI·dC)·poly(dI·dC), 20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mm DTT. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 15 min at room temperature. 1 × 104 cpm of target oligomer, end-labeled with [32P]dCTP, was added to the binding reaction and incubated at room temperature for a further 15 min. Following this, 1.5 μl of 10× DNA loading dye was added, and the binding reaction was immediately loaded onto a pre-electrophoresed 5% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid for 10 min, dried for 30 min at 80 °C, and exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film at −70 °C, usually for 18 h. The mouse NIH3T3 and human HeLa cell lines were maintained at 37 °C, 10% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Rat embryo fibroblasts (REFs) were prepared from 15- to 17-day-old Wistar rat embryos as described previously (28.Bellett A.J.D. Younghusband H.B. J. Cell. Physiol. 1979; 101: 33-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. REFs were used up to passage six and then replaced with new cells. For all cell types, 2.5 × 105 cells were seeded into 35-mm dishes and transfected with FuGENE 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) after 18 h. For each dish transfected the total amount of DNA was kept at 4 μg (except for the transfection performed in Fig. 9 c, where the total amount of DNA was 4.5 μg). The amounts of reporter and expression plasmids used are indicated in the figure legends, and sonicated salmon sperm DNA was used as carrier DNA to keep the total amount of DNA constant. The ratio of DNA (μg) to the volume of FuGENE 6 Reagent (μl) used was kept at 2:3 for each transfection. Sixty hours after transfection cells were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested by scraping into 1 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, centrifuged, then resuspended in 100 μl of 0.25 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Extracts of transfected cells were then prepared by three rounds of freezing and thawing followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000 × g and 4 °C to remove cellular debris. The supernatant was then heated to 65 °C for 10 min to inactivate a CAT inhibitor (29.Sleigh M.J. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Cell lysates were then normalized for protein content using the BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit (Pierce), and CAT activities were determined essentially as described in Sleigh (29.Sleigh M.J. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 156: 251-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Extracts of transfected cells were prepared as described above (see “CAT Assay”). Western immunoblot analysis was performed according to a standard procedure (30.Harlow E. Lane D. Immunoblotting: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 471-510Google Scholar). Briefly, protein fractionation was performed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 11 μg of cell extract per lane. Extracts were diluted in loading buffer containing 40% glycerol, 4% SDS, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 80 μm DTT, 0.08% bromphenol blue, and heated to 100 °C for 5 min before loading. Gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) in transfer buffer (192 mm glycine, 25 mm Tris, 0.05% SDS, 20% methanol). The filters were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in 1% non-fat dried milk and TBS buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 m NaCl). After washing in TTBS buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 mNaCl, 0.35% Tween), the filters were incubated for 1 h in TTBS buffer containing a 1:50 dilution of the commercial monoclonal p53 antibody DO-7 (Dako). After three washes, blots were incubated with anti-mouse antibodies conjugated with alkaline phosphatase for 1 h in TTBS. After further washes, detection of bound antibody was performed with the Immun-star Chemiluminescent Protein Detection System (Bio-Rad). To investigate the survival and growth of cells, 1.5 × 105 REFs were cotransfected, with the appropriate plasmid DNA, using FuGENE 6 Reagent (as described above). pCMVneo was included as one of the transfected plasmids at an amount of 0.2 μg to selectively permit survival of the transfected cells in the presence of the neomycin analogue G418 (24.Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341PubMed Google Scholar). Forty eight hours post-transfection REFs were maintained in medium containing 200 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 21 days. Cells were then fixed and stained with 0.1% crystal violet, 20% ethanol. The extent of cell survival was reflected by the number of G418-resistant colonies present. To determine whether v-Maf binds to the MARE-like site within the mouse p53 promoter, EMSAs were performed where an end-labeled synthetic double-stranded oligonucleotide, Oligomer M (Fig.2 a), was mixed with IVT v-Maf PT. Oligomer M spans 43 base pairs of the mouse p53 promoter from −81 to −39, and this region encompasses the MARE-like site situated between −66 and −54. Whereas v-Maf PT is a v-Maf protein that lacks the first 18 amino acids of the amino terminus, however, it has been shown to be as active as full-length v-Maf and c-MAF in DNA binding, transactivation and cell transformation abilities (4.Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Kawai S. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Kataoka K. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 700-712Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results (Fig. 2 b) showed that IVT v-Maf PT bound to Oligomer M. Furthermore, four nucleotide substitutions within the MARE-like site of Oligomer M (Oligomer Mmut, Fig. 2 a) abolished the ability of v-Maf PT to bind to this oligomer (Fig. 2 b). Therefore, we conclude that v-Maf binds to the MARE-like site located from −66 to −54 in the mouse p53 promoter. To determine whether the binding of v-Maf to the p53 promoter results in transcriptional activation, the plasmid, v-mafPT/pEFBssHII, expressing v-Maf PT under control of the human EF promoter (31.Kataoka K. Fujiwara K.T. Noda M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7581-7591Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar) was cotransfected into NIH3T3 cells with the reporter construct, pAACAT. pAACAT contains the region of the mouse p53 promoter from −224 to +116 cloned in front of the reporter CAT gene. This 340-base pair region of thep53 promoter, contained within pAACAT, has been shown to be sufficient to drive maximal expression of the mouse p53promoter (15.Bienz-Tadmor B. Zakut-Houri R. Libresco S. Givol D. Oren M. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 3209-3213Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 32.Hale T.K. Braithwaite A.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 663-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Results of an experiment (Fig.3 a) in which pAACAT activity was measured after titration of v-mafPT/pEFBssHII showed that v-Maf PT transactivated the p53 promoter in a dose-dependent manner. At the ratio of 3:1 (v-mafPT/pEFBssHII:pAACAT), over six independent experiments, v-Maf PT increased p53 promoter activity between 3- and 10-fold (data not shown), although typically activation was between 3- and 4-fold as shown in Fig. 3 a. In contrast, expression of v-Maf PT had little effect on pCAT3M, a “promoter-less” CAT construct into which the 340-base pairp53 promoter fragment was cloned to create pAACAT. Similar experiments were then performed in REFs and HeLa cells (Figs.3 b and 3 c). At the ratio of 3:1 (v-mafPT/pEFBssHII:pAACAT), v-Maf PT activatedp53 expression 17-fold in REFs (Fig. 3 b), whereas in HeLa cells expression of v-Maf PT increased p53 promoter activity by approximately 2.5-fold (Fig. 3 c). Similar results have been obtained in repeat experiments. Therefore, these experiments demonstrate that v-Maf is able to activatep53 expression in at least three different cellular environments, although the level of activation varies. To test if v-Maf requires the MARE-like site located in the mousep53 promoter for transactivation, 4-base pair substitutions were introduced into the MARE-like site within the p53promoter/reporter construct pAACAT. The 4-base pair substitutions are the same as those that abolished the binding of v-Maf PT to the MARE-like site within Oligomer M (Fig. 2 b). This mutant construct called pAAmut was then tested for its response to v-Maf PT when cotransfected into NIH3T3 cells with v-mafPT/pEFBssHII. In this experiment v-Maf PT transactivated pAACAT about 3-fold, whereas it had no effect on pAAmut (Fig. 4). This activation of thep53 promoter is specific to v-Maf as expression of luciferase or the adenovirus 2 E1b 58-kDa protein has no effect on pAACAT or pAAmut activity (Fig. 4). Consistent with the promoter/reporter experiments, overexpression of v-Maf results in an increase in p53 protein levels (Fig.5). When NIH3T3 cells were transfected with the v-Maf PT expression construct, v-mafPT/pEFBssHII, Western immunoblot analysis demonstrated that 30 h post-transfection, endogenous p53 protein was detectable in cells overexpressing v-Maf PT. In comparison, no p53 protein was detectable in mock-transfected NIH3T3 cells or in cells that had been transfected with a construct expressing the v-Maf PT deletion mutant ND5. This mutant lacks the amino-terminal activation domain (its structure is shown in Fig.6 a) and as demonstrated below cannot transcriptionally activate the p53 promoter (Fig. 6 c).Figure 6Functional domain analysis of v-Maf regulation of p53 expression. a, schematic representation of v-Maf mutant proteins (4.Kataoka K.

Sixty hours post-transfection cells were harvested and assayed for CAT activity. The promoter-less CAT construct pCAT3M (1 μg) was also cotransfected with 3 μg of either carrier DNA (mock) or v-mafPT/pEFBssHII as a control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) These data show that v-Maf transcriptionally activates the mousep53 promoter and that this transactivation requires the MARE-like site located between −66 to −54 in the mouse p53promoter. As a result of this transactivation, overexpression of v-Maf results in an increase in endogenous p53 protein levels. To determine which functional domains of v-Maf are required for transcriptional activation ofp53 expression, a series of mutants based on v-Maf PT (their structures are summarized in Fig. 6 a) were tested for their ability to bind to the p53 MARE and transcriptionally activate p53 expression. These v-Maf PT mutants were translated in vitro, and EMSAs were performed to test their ability to bind to Oligomer M. Fig.6 b shows that although v-Maf PT binds to its site within Oligomer M as demonstrated above (Fig. 2 b), the v-Maf PT mutants CD3, CD4, and L2PL4P, which have previously been shown not to form homodimers (4.Kataoka K.

Although these proteins have a similar structure that includes kinase, leucine zipper, and helix-loop-helix domains, they exhibit marked differences in their kinase activity and functional properties. For example, IKKβ has a 10–20-fold higher level of kinase activity for IκBα than does IKKα. Furthermore, disruption of the murine IKKβ gene, but not the IKKα gene, results in severe defects in activating the NF-κB pathway. Mice lacking IKKβ succumb to severe hepatic apoptosis because of failure to activate the NF-κB pathway, whereas mice deficient in IKKα exhibit skin and skeletal abnormalities and an embryonic lethal phenotype. To better characterize differences in the functional properties of these kinases, hybrid IKK proteins were constructed by domain swapping, and their kinase activity was assayed. These studies demonstrated that differences in the IKKα and IKKβ helix-loop-helix domains are primarily responsible for differences in their kinase activity.

Mutation of these serine residues to alanine leads to prolonged IKK activation, suggesting that phosphorylation of these residues, likely by autophosphorylation, functions to down-regulate IKKβ activity. Mutation of either the leucine zipper or the helix-loop-helip domain prevents IKK kinase activity (32.Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 35.Zandi E. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The leucine zipper motif mediates IKK heterodimerization and homodimerization, whereas the helix-loop-helix domain functions in modulating IKK kinase activity (32.Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar, 35.Zandi E. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, transfection of an expression vector containing an IKKβ construct in which the helix-loop-helix domain is deleted exhibits markedly reduced kinase activity as compared with wild-type IKKβ (32.Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1999; 284: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). However, the kinase activity of this mutated IKKβ protein can be restored by transfection of an expression vector encoding the HLH domain alone. This result indicates a critical role for the IKKβ helix-loop-helix domain in regulating IKK activity. Mice in which either the IKKα or IKKβ genes are disrupted exhibit unique phenotypes (36.Hu Y.

For example, disruption of the IKKα gene results in embryonic lethality, which is associated with a variety of abnormalities including epidermal hyperplasia and defective limb formation (36.Hu Y.

Terada N. Akira S. Science. 1999; 284: 313-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Only modest defects in the activation of the NF-κB pathway are noted in these IKKα-deficient mice. In contrast, mice lacking the IKKβ gene succumb to massive hepatic apoptosis immediately following birth (38.Li Q. Van Antwerp D. Mercurio F. Lee K.F. Verma I.M. Science. 1999; 284: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). These defects are due to the fact that these IKKβ-deficient mice are extremely defective in activating in the NF-κB pathway. Thus, IKKβ is more critical than is IKKα in activating the NF-κB pathway. In the current study, we characterized functional differences between IKKα and IKKβ. Chimeric IKKα and IKKβ kinases were constructed by domain swapping of the kinase, leucine zipper, or helix-loop-helix domains. We find that differences in the helix-loop-helix domains of IKKα and IKKβ are critical in regulating differential IKK kinase activity. These studies address important aspects of IKK function involved in their activation of the NF-κB pathway. COS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Aspirin (Sigma) and sulindac sulfide (Merck) were dissolved in 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to make stock solutions. In transfection assays, aspirin and sulindac sulfide were used at a concentrations of 5 mm and 200 μm, respectively (31.Yin M.-J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B.

Aspirin and sulindac sulfide were added to the cell culture medium at 30 h post-transfection and incubated for 2 h prior to preparation of cellular extracts. Expression vectors (50 ng to 1 μg) encoding the IKK hybrids alone or in the presence of NIK or MEKK1 expression vectors were transfected into approximately 80% confluent COS cells in 60-mm tissue culture plates using Fugene 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Cells were harvested 32 h after the transfection, and extracts were prepared for immunoprecipitation and assays of kinase activity as described (30.Yin M.-J. Christerson L.B. Yamamoto Y. Kwak Y.-T.

Cai Z. Pease L.R. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 217: 270-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar) by swapping IKKα and IKKβ kinase (KD), leucine zipper (LZ), or HLH domains. The constructs generated included IKK(αK/βLH), IKK(βK/αLH), IKK(αKL/βH), and IKK(βKL/αH). The vectors pRcBactHA-IKKαWT and pCMV2-pFLAG-IKKβWT were used as templates for the PCR (12.Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1853) Google Scholar). To construct IKK(αK/βLH), the oligonucleotide primer set, 5′-GAA TTC AAG CTT ATG GAG CGG CCC CCG GG GCT GCG GC-3′ and 5′-GAT GTC ATC CAG GGC CTT AAA ACA TCT TGG CTG CTT-3′, was used for PCR with the template pRcBactHA-IKKαWT to generate the KD of IKKα. The oligonucleotide primer set, 5′-AAG CAG CCA AGA TGT TTT AAG GCC CTG GAT GAC ATC T-3′ and 5′-CTA GTC TAG ATC ATG AGG CCT GCT CCA GGC AGC-3′, was used for PCR with pCMV2-pFLAG-IKKβWT to generate the LZ and HLH domains of IKKβ. These two PCR products were used for template-independent PCR, and the final PCR product was cloned into the HindIII and KpnI restriction sites of pCMV2-pFLAG. For each of the constructs described below, a similar strategy was used as detailed in the preceding paragraph. IKK(βK/αLH) was constructed using the oligonucleotide primers 5′-TGG GCC CAA TGG CTG CTT CGT ATT AAG GAT CAC ATT-3′ and 5′-CAT AGG AAG CTT TCA TTC TGT TAA CCA ACT CCA ATC-3′ with pCMV2-pFLAG-IKKβWT used as the template to isolate the KD of IKKβ. The other primer set, 5′-CAT GGC AAG CTT ATG AGC GGT CAC CTT CCC TGA CA-3′ and 5′-AAT GTG ATC CAT AAT ACG AAG CAG CCA TTG GGC CCA T-3′, was used in PCR analysis with the template pRcBactHA-IKKαWT to generate the LZ and HLH domains of IKKα. The two PCR products were fused by PCR to generate IKK(βK/αLH). IKK(αKL/βH) was prepared using the oligonucleotide primers, 5′-GAA TTC AAG CTT ATG GAG CGG CCC CCG GG GCT GCG GC-3′ and 5′-CTC TAG GTCGTC CAG CGT GTC TCC CTG ACG TCT TCC-3′, with the template pRcBactHA-IKKαWT to isolate the KD and LZ domains of IKKα. The other set of oligonucleotide primers, 5′-CTA GTC TAG ATC ATG AGG CCT GCT CCA GGC AGC-3′ and 5′-GGA AGA CGT CAG GGA GAC ACG CTG GAC GAC CTA GAG-3′, was used in PCR with the pCMV2-pFLAG-IKKβWT template to generate the HLH of IKKβ. The two fragments were used in PCR to generate IKK(αKL/βH). To construct IKK(βKL/αH), the KD and LZ domains of IKKβ were prepared by using the oligonucleotide primers, 5′-CAT AGG AAG CTT TCA TTC TGT TAA CCA ACT CCA ATC-3′ and 5′-GGC CGG AAG CAG GGG GGA TTG ATG GAA TCT CTG GAA-3′ in PCR with the template pCMV2-pFLAG-IKKβWT. The HLH domain of IKKα was produced by PCR using the oligonucleotide primer set, 5′-CAT GGC AAG CTT ATG AGC GGT CAC CTT CCC TGA CA-3′ and 5′-TTC CAG AGA TTC CAT CAA TCC CCC CTG CTT CCG GCC C-3′, with the template pRcBactHA-IKKαWT. The two fragments were fused by PCR to generate IKK(βKL/αH). IKKα and IKKβ kinase domains containing either constitutively active (SS/EE) or inactive (SS/AA) mutations in the MAP kinase activation loop were fused to the LZ and HLH domains of wild-type IKKβ and IKKα using a similar strategy as described. The mutants constructed were IKK(αK/βLH) SS/EE, IKK(βK/αLH) SS/EE, IKK(αK/βLH) SS/AA, and IKK(βK/αLH) SS/AA. The mutant IKK(αK/βLH) SS/EE was generated using PCR with the oligonucleotide primers 5′-GAA TTC AAG CTT ATG GAG CGG CCC CCG GG GCT GCG GC-3′ and 5′-GAT GTC ATC CAG GGC CTT AAA ACA TCT TGG CTG CTT-3′ and the template IKKα SS/EE to generate the KD. This PCR product was used as megaprimer with the oligonucleotide primer 5′-GCA GGT ACC TCA TGA GGC CTG CTC CAG GCA G-3′ and the template pCMV2-pFLAG-IKK(αK/βLH) to generate IKK(αK/βLH)SS/EE. To construct IKK(αK/βLH) SS/AA, PCR was performed with template IKKα SS/AA using same oligonucleotide primer set used to generate the KD of IKKα SS/EE. PCR was performed with the KD fragment of IKKα SS/AA and the oligonucleotide primer 5′-GCA GGT ACC TCA TGA GGC CTG CTC CAG GCA G-3′ with the template pCMV2-pFLAG-IKK(αK/βLH) to generate IKK(αK/βLH) SS/AA. IKK(βK/αLH) SS/EE was constructed using the oligonucleotide primer set, 5′-CAT GGC AAG CTT ATG AGC TGG TCA CCT TCC CTG ACA-3′ and 5′-AAT GTG ATC CAT AAT ACG AAG CAG CCA TTG GGC CCA T-3′ and the template IKKβ SS/EE to generate the KD. The first PCR product was used as megaprimer with the oligonucleotide 5′-CAT AGG AAG CTT TCA TTC TGT TAA CCA ACT CCA ATC-3′ and the pCMV2-pFLAG-IKK(βK/αLH) template to generate IKK(βK/αLH) SS/EE. Finally, to construct IKK(βK/αLH) SS/AA, IKKβ SS/AA was used as the template in PCR with oligonucleotide primer set used for generation of the KD of IKKβ SS/EE. The KD of IKKβ SS/AA and the oligonucleotide primer 5′-CAT AGG AAG CTT TCA TTC TGT TAA CCA ACT CCA ATC-3′ were used in PCR with the template pCMV2-pFLAG-IKK(βK/αLH) to generate IKK(βK/αLH) SS/AA. All IKK hybrid constructs were cloned into HindIII andKpnI restriction site of pCMV2-FLAG or pCMV1-Myc and subjected to DNA sequence analysis. Histidine and influenza hemagglutinin-tagged wild-type and hybrid IKKα and IKKβ proteins were each cloned into the baculovirus expression vector (pAcHLT), and baculoviruses were generated by cotransfection with Baculo Gold recombinant DNA and transfer vectors (PharMingen). The recombinant baculoviruses were used to infect Sf9 cells to express the different IKK proteins. The IKK proteins were purified using nickel-agarose chromatography, immunoprecipitated with the 12CA5 monoclonal antibody, and then assayed in in vitro kinase assays as described (31.Yin M.-J. Yamamoto Y. Gaynor R.B. Nature. 1998; 396: 77-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar). To assay the epitope-tagged IKK proteins, COS cells were transfected with CMV expression vectors containing the IKK cDNAs. Extracts prepared from these COS cells were suspended in lysis buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 6 mm EDTA, 6 mm EGTA, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, pH 10.0, and protease inhibitor (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The cellular lysates (250 μg) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 500 ng of the anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2 or 50 μl of 12CA5 supernatant to isolate the epitope-tagged IKK proteins, and protein G-agarose (20 μl) was then added. After washing of the immunoprecipitates, kinase assays were performed at 30 °C for 30 min with buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 μm ATP, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm NaVO4, pH 10.0, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 5 μg of the GST -IκBα (aa 1–54). The kinase reaction mixtures were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and phosphorylation of IκBα was detected by autoradiography. Whole cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After transfer to nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), monoclonal antibodies directed against FLAG (M2), the influenza hemagglutinin (12CA5), or Myc were added followed by anti-mouse IgG antibody. Proteins were detected with chemiluminescence reagents as described (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). IKK is comprised of two catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, which have 52% amino acid identity (11.DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M.

In addition to an amino-terminal kinase domain, these proteins also have leucine zipper and helix-loop-helix motifs. IKKα and IKKβ kinase domains are present within their amino-terminal 300 amino acid residues, their leucine zipper domains are present between residues 455 and 485, and their HLH domains are present between residues 605 and 645 (11.DiDonato J.A.

To characterize functional differences in these two kinases, chimeric kinases were constructed comprised of different domains of IKKα and IKKβ. The portions of IKKα in these fusions included the KD (aa 1–300), LZ (aa 301–554), and HLH (aa 555–745), whereas the regions of IKKβ in these fusions included the KD (aa 1–300), LZ (aa 302–555), and HLH (aa 560–756).

Dihydrofolate reductase and β-lactamase have been inserted in four different positions of phosphoglycerate kinase. The resultant chimeric proteins are all overexpressed, and the host as well as the inserted partners are functional. Although not explicitly designed, functional coupling between the two fused partners was observed in some of the chimeras. These results show that the tolerance of protein structures to very large structured insertions is more general than previously expected and supports the idea that the natural sequence continuity of a structural domain is not required for the folding process.

This modularity of protein structure is believed to be the result of an evolutionary process where two or more ancestral genes coding for single domains proteins were at some stage fused together and gave rise to proteins with new biological properties. This model assumes that the putative ancestral proteins were able to fold into stable native structures before the fusion event took place and suggests that the corresponding domains may still be independent folding units in the resultant fused protein. It has indeed been observed in several cases that isolated domains of multidomain proteins can fold independently (1.Minard P. Hall L. Betton J.M. Missiakas D. Yon J.M.

Biol. 1997; 4: 801-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Partially based on these arguments, the folding process of large proteins is often described as a sequential and hierarchical process in which interactions between elements close in sequence position are likely to be formed during early steps, before the interactions involving sequentially distant elements. Consequently, it is often stated that, during the folding process of a multidomain protein, the domains fold first and then interact with each other (7.Jaenicke R. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 237-243PubMed Google Scholar). This conception implicitly associates the continuity of a polypeptide sequence coding for a domain and its folding ability. As first pointed out by Russell (8.Russell R.B. Protein Eng. 1994; 7: 1407-1410Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), this view of the folding process of multidomain proteins is simple and rather satisfying for proteins made by continuous domains but becomes more puzzling for the subset of proteins made of discontinuous domains. Proteins with discontinuous domains can be viewed as proteins in which there is at least one domain, or a fraction of a domain, inserted within another domain. Well known examples of such proteins are dsbA (9.Martin J.L. Bardwell J.C. Kuriyan Nature. 1993; 365: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), pyruvate kinase (10.Levine M. Muirhead H. Stammers D.K. Stuart D.I. Nature. 1978; 271: 626-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and DNA polymerase (11.Delarue M. Poch O. Tordo N. Moras D. Argos P. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 461-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (578) Google Scholar). Although proteins with continuous domains are more common, discontinuous domains made by two segments of the polypeptide chains are not very rare exceptions (12.Russel R.B. Ponting C.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A recent systematic survey of structural domains showed that 28% of structural domains are not continuous (13.Jones S. Stewart M. Michie A. Swindells M.B. Orengo C. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This suggests that the continuity of the polypeptide sequence within a structural unit, although the most common situation, is not mandatory for a productive folding process. Two other lines of experimental evidence tend to support this somewhat counterintuitive view. First, functional proteins can be reconstituted by the reassociation of two or more polypeptide fragments. It is now clear that this process can occur with pairs of fragments found in many different proteins (14.de Prat-Gay G. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 843-847Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that the two complementary fragments need not be able to fold autonomously or correspond to structural domains to reassociate functionally (15.Pecorari F. Guilbert C. Minard P. Desmadril M. Yon J.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3465-3476Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Second, it has been shown that natural proteins made by two continuous domains are still able to fold when one or the other domain is made discontinuous by a circular permutation of the polypeptide sequence (16.Ritco-Vonsovici M. Minard P. Desmadril M. Yon J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16543-16551Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 17.Heinemann U. Hahn M. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1995; 64: 121-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). This experimental evidence clearly suggests that the efficiency of the folding process of a continuous structural domain does not strictly depend upon the natural connectivity existing in the native structure. A further consequence of this proposal is that a discontinuity introduced by the artificial insertion of a large sequence, possibly large enough to fold autonomously, could be accepted within a naturally continuous protein domain. This could naturally occur as a consequence of a genetic rearrangement leading to the insertion of a coding sequence within another unrelated coding sequence. Such rearrangement has been observed in natural proteins where domains are inserted or permuted (12.Russel R.B. Ponting C.P. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 364-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Insertion of a large sequence is generally considered to be incompatible with proper folding of the host protein in which the insertion event took place. However, the observation of accepted natural or engineered discontinuities in structural domains suggests that this intuitive view might be misleading. Large insertion of structural domains could be tolerated as long as the inserted protein is introduced in positions where no steric hindrance occurs. In other words, these types of rearrangement would be more constrained by the stability of the resultant protein than by the folding process of the host protein. We have experimentally tested this assumption and constructed a set of chimeric proteins. In these engineered proteins two different and unrelated proteins of more than 100 amino acids have been inserted in several positions of a host protein. The design, expression, and properties of these chimeric proteins are described. Possible functional couplings between inserted and host proteins were investigated. The genes coding forEscherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)1 and β-lactamase (BLA) were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using 100 ng of genomic DNA from E. coli strain XL1-blue MRF′ and 10 ng of plasmid pBR322, respectively. An NgoM1 restriction site was added at the end of the amplified sequences. These fragments were inserted into the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) gene carried by the expression vector pYE-PGK (18.Minard P. Bowen D.J. Hall L. Littlechild J.A. Watson H.C. Protein Eng. 1990; 3: 515-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) in which a unique BspE1 restriction site has been previously introduced by site-directed mutagenesis at the selected positions. The coding sequences of all the chimeras were completely sequenced to check for the absence of unwanted mutations. Wild type (WT) PGK and chimeric proteins were expressed in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae PGK-deficient strain BC3 (19.Piper P.W. Curran B.P.G. Curr. Genet. 1990; 17: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Crude extracts used for expression efficiency testing were prepared as described (1.Minard P. Hall L. Betton J.M. Missiakas D. Yon J.M. Protein Eng. 1989; 3: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and submitted to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (see Fig. 2). Expected molecular masses for PGK/DHFR chimeric proteins, PGK/BLA chimeric proteins, and 89DHFR/290BLA were 62.2, 73.4, and 91.1 kDa, respectively. Crude extracts were precipitated by saturated ammonium sulfate and desalted by chromatography on a Sephadex G-25 column. Protein-containing fractions were purified by HPLC ion exchange on a TSK-DEAE column equilibrated in Tris (20 mm; pH 8) and eluted by a linearly increasing gradient of sodium chloride concentration. The gradient was optimized for each particular protein. Fractions containing enzyme activities were pooled and finally purified by gel filtration as described for WT PGK (1.Minard P. Hall L. Betton J.M. Missiakas D. Yon J.M. Protein Eng. 1989; 3: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Purified protein used for further characterization appeared as a single band on SDS-PAGE analysis. Protein concentrations were determined spectroscopically using the following molar extinction coefficients (20.Pace N.C. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein. Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3449) Google Scholar): ε280 = 51205m−1.cm−1 for PGK/BLA and ε280 = 55,375 for PGK/DHFR constructs. Wild type β-lactamase was produced as described previously (21.Betton J.M. Jacob J.P. Hofnung M. Broome-Smith J. Nature Biotech. 1997; 15: 1276-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). PGK and DHFR activities were measured at 22 °C as described by Betton et al. (1997) and Iwakura and Matthews (22.Iwakura M. Matthews C.R. Protein Eng. 1992; 5: 791-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), respectively. BLA activity was measured at 22 °C using nitrocefin as substrate (23.Laminet A.A. Plückthun A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1469-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Activity measurements were also systematically been carried out, by using the double concentration of substrates mentioned in the references above, to ensure that insertions did not provoke any dramatic increase in theK m constant of each moiety. Hence, substrate-saturating conditions were always respected. Proteins (2 μm, final concentration) were incubated at 22 °C for 12 h in a 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 10 mm DTT (for PGK/BLA chimeras and WT BLA) or 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (for PGK/DHFR chimera, WT PGK, and WT DHFR) at various guanidinium chloride (GdmCl) concentrations. Enzymatic activities were then assayed for each denaturant concentration. The activities were determined following appropriate dilution in activity buffer without denaturant. The residual concentration of guanidine hydrochloride was, therefore, very low in the activity test. Control experiments have shown that this residual denaturant concentration does not affect the activity test and that the renaturation kinetics of the unfolded fraction is negligible during the time required for dilution and activity determination. Unfolding transitions were fitted as described previously (24.Garcia P. Desmadril M. Minard P. Yon J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 397-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Proteins (70 μm) were incubated at 22 °C for at least 3 h in 50 mmphosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 10 mm DTT (for PGK/BLA chimeras and WT BLA) or 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol (for PGK/DHFR chimeras, WT PGK, and WT DHFR) at a final GdmCl concentration of 3.5 m. Refolding was triggered by a 35-fold dilution in the same buffer without GdmCl. Recovery of activity was fitted using a monoexponential term according to the Marquardt algorithm (25.Press W.H. Flannery B.P. Tenkolsky S.A. Vetterling W.T. Numerical Recipes. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1986: 523-528Google Scholar). The protein used as the host was phosphoglycerate kinase.

It is a monomeric protein of 415 amino acids made by two essentially continuous domains (Fig.1 A). Although insertion within elements of secondary structure may also be well tolerated in some cases (32.Betton J.M. Martineau P. Saurin W. Hofnung M. Location of tolerated insertions/deletion in the structure of the maltose binding protein..FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 34-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), sterical clashes between the host and the inserted proteins are more easily eliminated by selecting surface loops or turns connecting elements of secondary structure as insertion points. To preserve the functionality of both the inserted proteins and the host, insertions were performed in various loops not directly involved in the catalytic site. The inserted proteins: dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR, Protein Data Bank code 1RF7) and β-lactamase (BLA, Protein Data Bank code 1AXB) are monomeric proteins with extremities of the polypeptide chain relatively close in proximity. Finally, these two proteins can be reversibly refolded and their folding properties are well documented (33.Jennings P.A. Finn B.E. Jones B.E. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3783-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 34.Vanhove M. Raquet X. Palzkill T. Pain R.H. Frere J.M. Proteins. 1996; 25: 104-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting constructions are summarized in TableI. The structure of the inserted and host proteins and a possible structure of one of the chimeric proteins are shown in Fig. 1. The illustrative scheme of the chimeric protein (Fig.1 B) is not a crystallographic structure and is based on the assumption that there are no conformational changes of the two proteins caused by their fusion.Table ISequences of the constructed chimeric proteinsChimeric proteinsDenominationSequencePGK/BLA71BLA··N71 SGG H1P2...H282W 283 GAG E72··89BLA··L89 SGG H1P2...H282W283 GAG D90··129BLA··S129 GG H1P2...H282W283 GAG R130··290BLA··S290 GG H1P2...H262W263 GAG A291··PGK/DHFR71DHFR··N71 SGG M1I2...R158R159 GAG E72··89DHFR··L89 SGG M1I2...R158R159 GAG D90··290DHFR··S290 GG M1I2...R158R159 GAG A291··PGK/(DHFR + BLA)89DHFR/290BLA··L89 SGG M1I2...R158R159 GAG D90...S290 GG H1P2...H262W263 GAG A291··Numbers are related to the sequences of wild type proteins.

Italic font represents linker residues. Bold font represents sequence of the inserted β-lactamase (263 residues) and dihydrofolate reductase (159 residues). Analysis of crude extracts (Fig.2) shows that all the chimeric proteins are overexpressed in S. cerevisiae to a level very similar to that of wild type PGK in the same expression system. This is a strong indication that the proteins are able to fold in vivoand are at least moderately stable. Indeed, highly unstable or improperly folded proteins expressed in yeast tend to be rapidly degraded and are not observed to be present to such a high steady-state level. The presence of inclusion bodies, a common problem in bacterial expression systems, could also explain the observed high expression level. However, inclusion bodies are much less frequently observed in yeast expression systems (35.de Bernadez-Clark E. Georgiou G. Georgiou G. Protein Refolding. American Chemical Society, Washington, DC1991: 1-20Google Scholar). Furthermore, the yeast strain used for expression has a disrupted chromosomal PGK gene and is not able to grow on a glucose-containing growth medium. All the transformed cells expressing the chimeric proteins have recovered the ability to grow on glucose-containing medium. Therefore, the PGK moiety of the chimeric proteins is enzymatically active. A subset of these chimeric proteins has been purified, and the activity of the host as well as of the inserted proteins has been determined. The results reported in TableII reveal that both the inserted (DHFR or BLA) and the host protein (PGK) have a specific activity of the same order of magnitude as that of the wild type proteins. Moreover, the three enzymatic activities are present in the triple chimera (100, 1.2, and 136 s−1 for PGK, DHFR, and BLA activities, respectively). Clearly, both the inserted and host proteins must be able to fold properly in vivo to express this range of biological activities.Table IIEnzymatic activities of the chimeric proteinsProteinHostInsertk cat(s−1)%k cat(s−1)%wt-PGK1480100-wt-BLA758100-wt-DHFR8.6100-71BLA681 464505989BLA326 2246261129BLA296 20 8711290BLA555 384696271DHFR503 343.94589DHFR681 465.462290DHFR370 254.856 Open table in a new tab The ability of these proteins to refold in vitro was examined. Proteins were completely unfolded, and the rate and extent of activity recovery of the host and inserted proteins were monitored. Enzyme activity was used as a folding probe, because it is the only probe that allows nonambiguous discrimination of the folding of the host and insert moiety. Classical structural probes, such as circular dichroism or fluorescence, cannot be clearly attributed to a specific part of the chimera. The results are summarized in TableIII and Fig.3. The wild type proteins (PGK, DHFR, and BLA) refold in vitro with almost complete reversibility, whereas the activity recovered following an in vitrounfolding/refolding cycle of each chimera is between 20 and 80% of the initial activity. This suggests that a significant proportion of the population of the chimera molecules is trapped during the in vitro refolding process. Although the insertion clearly affects the refolding yield, the observed refolding efficiency remains relatively high in comparison to the in vitro folding efficiency of many natural proteins of similar complexity. There is no clear correlation between the effect on the refolding yield and the point of insertion (type of loop, N-terminal or C-terminal domain) nor with the nature of the inserted proteins.Table IIIUnfolding transition and refolding kinetics parameters for chimeric proteinsProteinCmNKinetics refoldingYield of reactivationHostInsertHostInsertHostInsertHostInsertms −1%wt-PGK0.70-19.0*-4.6.10−3-96-wt-BLA1.0-13.0-2.7.10−2-98-wt-DHFR2.3-7.5-0.11-98-71BLA0.30 ± 0.030.31 ± 0.024.2 ± 1.35.2 ± 1.4(5.8 ± 1.0) × 10−4(3.8 ± 0.4) × 10−464 ± 680 ± 489BLA0.36 ± 0.010.39 ± 0.0210.6 ± 1.98.9 ± 1.7(4.0 ± 0.5) × 10−4(4.1 ± 0.5) × 10−453 ± 284 ± 3129BLA0.22 ± 0.020.30 ± 0.033.4 ± 0.74.4 ± 1.4(1.8 ± 0.5) × 10−4(1.0 ± 0.4) × 10−322 ± 228 ± 3290BLA0.36 ± 0.030.37 ± 0.026.9 ± 1.68.1 ± 1.8(8.7 ± 0.8) × 10−4(1.0 ± 0.2) × 10−327 ± 231 ± 271DHFR0.35 ± 0.020.33 ± 0.047.7 ± 2.42.6 ± 0.7(1.0 ± 0.2) × 10−3(2.9 ± 0.5) × 10−351 ± 464 ± 489DHFR0.57 ± 0.040.31 ± 0.027.8 ± 2.52.2 ± 0.4(7.6 ± 0.8) × 10−4(1.4 ± 0.3) × 10−335 ± 251 ± 3290DHFR0.38 ± 0.090.52 ± 0.11 and1.9 ± 1.53.4 ± 1.7 and(3.3 ± 0.4) × 10−4(5.2 ± 0.6) × 10−438 ± 235 ± 31.55 ± 0.1111.5 ± 5.7 Open table in a new tab The reactivation kinetics was followed for the host as well as the inserted proteins. The results reported in Fig. 3 clearly show that the reactivation kinetics of the host protein is slowed down with respect to wild-type PGK. Although their internal connectivity is not modified by their insertion in the host protein, the reactivation rate of the inserted protein (DHFR or BLA) is systematically reduced with respect to the refolding rates of these proteins when isolated. The strong effect on their refolding rates shows that the folding process of the inserted proteins is perturbed, in some way, by the connection of their extremities to the host protein. Although the physical basis for this effect is not clear, this observation suggests strongly that the inserted and host proteins, although constituting autonomous folding units when isolated, are no longer independent folding subunits when connected to each other. At least two hypotheses could account for such an effect. First, the folding process of the inserted polypeptide chain could be affected by transient interactions with other parts of the polypeptide chain outside its own folding unit. Alternatively, during the folding process, the volume statistically occupied by the PGK polypeptide chain fragments linked to each end of the inserted protein could restrict the dynamic possibilities of the inserted polypeptide chain and in this way hinder the folding process of the inserted moiety. The folding process of BLA and DHFR has been described in detail (33.Jennings P.A. Finn B.E. Jones B.E. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 3783-3789Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar,34.Vanhove M. Raquet X. Palzkill T. Pain R.H. Frere J.M. Proteins. 1996; 25: 104-111Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is a complex process involving parallel pathways with relaxation times ranging from the millisecond time scale to tens of seconds. In both isolated proteins the formation of a large part of the secondary structure occurs on a time scale shorter than one second. The recovery of enzyme activity used as a folding probe in this work corresponds to the very last step in the folding process and is controlled by slow isomerization of partially structured conformers. The inserted protein always folds faster or at the same rate as does the host protein. This result could suggest that the way in which proteins accommodate such a large insertion is by folding first the inserted object and then the host protein. However, this sequential model would lead to a lag phase in the recovery of the activity of the host protein corresponding to the refolding of the inserted protein. Such a lag phase is clearly not apparent in our experimental data. The stability of the chimeric proteins was evaluated by monitoring the loss of each activity induced by increasing guanidinium hydrochloride concentrations. The losses of activity are not fully reversible, and therefore, the transition curves cannot be used to derive a true estimate of each protein's thermodynamic stability. However, the transition midpoint and the cooperativity of the transition curves (Table III and Fig. 4) clearly reveal that the chimeric proteins are less resistant to denaturation and presumably less stable than are the wild type proteins. The comparison of the denaturation curves of the chimeras with their parent proteins shows that, in all chimeras but one, the host as well as the inserted proteins are destabilized by the insertion. A clear correlation is observed between the unfolding transition curves and the nature of the inserted protein. In the three BLA-PGK proteins, the host and inserted proteins lose their activity concomitantly as the denaturant concentration increases. This suggests that the stability of the two partners are strongly coupled. This coupling is observed with BLA inserted in PGK at various positions and therefore is not related to particular local interactions between the two partners. In the DHFR-PGK chimeras, host and insert unfolding curves depend on the position of insertion. In particular, for 290DHFR the host and inserted protein are almost independent. A first transition below 0.4m corresponds to the unfolding of PGK as shown by the loss of PGK activity and by a strong decrease in the far UV circular dichroism signal. The unfolding of PGK occurring in this first transition does affect DHFR activity but only to a limited extent, suggesting that the DHFR structure is largely unaffected by the unfolding of associated PGK. A second transition corresponding to the inserted DHFR is observed at a much higher denaturant concentration, in the range expected for isolated DHFR. This type of unfolding process is, surprisingly, the only observed example in this set of chimeric proteins of an independent behavior of the inserted protein. In this case, the host protein is destabilized by the discontinuity created by the insertion, whereas the inserted protein remains largely unaffected. It is generally observed that there is little functional interaction between the two partners in “classical” end-to-end fusion proteins. The presumably stronger structural coupling present in internal-fusion proteins could possibly induce functional interactions between host and inserted proteins (36.Benito A. Feliu J.X. Villaverde A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21251-21256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The activity either of the host or inserted proteins were measured in the presence of the substrates of the other protein. We observed in three different cases that the presence of the substrates of one protein does modulate positively or negatively the activity of the other one (Fig. 5). Control experiments have shown that there are no such effects for the wild type proteins. These results demonstrate that functional coupling between the two partners of an internal fusion protein is not a rare occurrence, although these interactions were not explicitly designed in these chimeric proteins. These experiments reveal that two different unrelated proteins of more than 150 amino acids can be inserted in four different positions of a host protein. The host as well as the inserted protein are able to fold in a functional conformation. The main consequences of the insertions are a loss of stability of the host and inserted proteins and a partial loss of reversibility of the in vitrorefolding process. The loss of stability of the host protein is in part due to the perturbation of the local sequence in which the insertion took place, and it seems plausible that the large discontinuity created by the insertion is responsible for the destabilizing effect on the host protein. It is somehow more surprising that in all but one chimeric proteins analyzed (290DHFR), the inserted protein is also strongly destabilized. The loss of reversibility, although clearly significant, remains relatively moderate in view of the perturbation introduced. No attempts were made to improve the folding reversibility by manipulating the refolding conditions or the temperature refolding protein concentration, which are often necessary to improve the refolding yield of many natural proteins of a similar complexity. This clearly supports the view that, at least with yeast PGK, the sequence continuity of a structural domain is not an essential requirement for a productive folding process. The positions of the insertion points were selected on a very general criterion: They are located on surface loops not directly involved in the catalytic site. These positions were not selected on the basis of a possible folding mechanism or as the result of a genetic screening. An elegant series of genetic experiments on maltose binding protein has shown that several regions of this protein, including secondary structure elements, are permissive regions relative to insertion. These regions have recently been used as insertion sites for β-lactamase, and the two chimeric proteins were shown to be active (21.Betton J.M. Jacob J.P. Hofnung M. Broome-Smith J. Nature Biotech. 1997; 15: 1276-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). A chimeric protein made by the insertion of a xylanase domain in a permuted glucanase domain has been recently described (37.Ay J. Gotz F. Borriss R. Heinemann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6613-6618Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), showing that the structures of the inserted and host partners are preserved in the fused protein. This result demonstrates that the Jellyroll fold is dominated by long range intramolecular contacts. The present results further support the idea that large structured insertions can be artificially introduced within a protein. All the designed chimeric proteins, those with two different proteins in four various positions as well as the triple chimera, are biologically active. It should be emphasized that loops involved in the substrate binding sites were not retained as insertion points for practical reasons rather than for folding or structural principles. The idea was simply to preserve the host activity as a convenient way to monitor the proper folding of the host protein. The tolerance observed in this work suggests that insertions in the loops involved in substrate binding would be structurally tolerated. Moreover, as reported by others with maltose binding protein (21.Betton J.M. Jacob J.P. Hofnung M. Broome-Smith J. Nature Biotech. 1997; 15: 1276-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), “permissive” regions selected by a genetic screen were shown to occur within secondary structures, showing that the location of an insertion point in a loop is not a mandatory criterion. Therefore, it seems that tolerance to a large insertion is not restricted to a very limited region of the polypeptide chain (21.Betton J.M. Jacob J.P. Hofnung M. Broome-Smith J. Nature Biotech. 1997; 15: 1276-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) nor to a specific topology (37.Ay J. Gotz F. Borriss R. Heinemann U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6613-6618Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These results, together with tolerance to circular permutation, clearly support the idea that protein folding does not involve an obligatory step-by-step sequence of structure-building events that cannot tolerate perturbation. It is more suggestive of a process that can lead to the same final structure through different possible sequences of events as originally suggested by Harrison and Durbin (38.Harrison S.C. Durbin R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4028-4030Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). To evaluate the possible evolutionary implications of these results, it must be stressed that the rather general criterion used in this study to select the insertion points does induce restrictions relative to the probability of a random protein insertion event occurring during natural evolution. First, the inserted protein is a folded protein and its extremities are close to one another. Furthermore, if the activity of the two fused partners is under a selective pressure, the insertion points must be compatible with the functional integrity of the two fused partners. Finally, these criteria might be restrictive enough to explain why large insertion and discontinuous domains are not the most common situation observed during protein evolution. New activating or inhibitory effects transmitted between the two fused partners were observed, although this was not intentionally designed. These occurred in three cases in the subset of proteins examined and suggest that insertion of a binding domain within a different protein is a possible evolutionary solution toward new regulatory properties of originally simpler proteins. Further studies will be necessary to know whether or not the specific properties of the host and inserted proteins used in the present study are responsible for this surprising tolerance. Comparison of natural PGK sequences shows that PGK genes found in Trypanosoma brucei or the related organism Chrytidia fasciculatahave insertions in one of the regions selected in this study (position 73). In one of the genes, the insertion is relatively short: 16 amino acids (39.Bernstein B.E. Michels P.A. Hol W.G.J. Nature. 1997; 385: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The structure of this protein has been determined and shows that it is folded as a protruding helical region. In another gene of the same organisms and in the same position, there is a much larger insertion of about 100 amino acids. The function and cellular localization of this gene product, which was originally qualified as a PGK-related protein, is not known. Together with the conservation of all the catalytic residues, our results suggest that this protein is a functional PGK. The other positions that were used as insertion sites in the present study do not correspond to positions where natural insertions are observed in other PGK genes. Relative to many small single domain proteins currently used as folding models, PGK is a relatively large and slow-folding protein (15.Pecorari F. Guilbert C. Minard P. Desmadril M. Yon J.M. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3465-3476Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Therefore, it could be suggested that the time required for PGK folding would be largely sufficient for the inserted protein to fold first. In other words, the slow folding rate of PGK could be directly responsible for this a priori unusual tolerance to insertions. However, the results show that the folding time range of PGK as well as of DHFR and BLA is considerably slowed down when fused together, suggesting that the folding rates of the proteins taken separately are no longer preserved in the chimera. The folding rates of isolated proteins might therefore not constitute a relevant criterion to design new properly folded chimeric proteins. The constraint on the relative time range of the inserted and host protein could only be revealed by further experiments on other chimeric proteins. Because the inserted proteins are devoid of any discontinuity in the chimeras, their significant destabilization and slowing down of the refolding process were not predicted by the strictly modular view of the multidomain protein-folding process. Instead, the present results suggest that in terms of folding rate and stability, autonomous folding units do not remain autonomous once their polypeptide chains are connected. These data also show that the folding process of such complex proteins remains relatively efficient in vivo as well as in vitro despite the major changes in the molecular organization and in the folding kinetics of the individual partners. This supports the idea that, if the folded state is stable, the folding process is not highly constrained and does not need to be strictly organized or coordinated. Remarkably, the extremely efficient yeast PGK expression system used in this work remained so far relatively inefficient to express proteins other than PGK at a very high level. However, the inserted proteins are, in the context of the chimeric proteins expressed, at a very high level and are correctly folded in vivo. It would be useful to verify whether this very high functional expression efficiency is preserved with other inserted proteins. Then, the yeast expression system could be used to produce large amounts of proteins that are difficult to express or to refold in bacterial systems. This study raises new questions and opens experimental routes to more systematic studies on the spectrum and properties of the allowed sequences inserted in different sites of a protein. For example, it seems intuitive that a long inserted sequence must necessarily be folded in order to be functionally accepted by the host protein. This property could constitute the basis of a possible and interesting new screening method to select for the folding ability of random amino acid sequences. The fraction of the sequence space giving rise to a folded sequence is indeed an important but still open question. We are very grateful to John O'Neill from C. R. Matthews' laboratory (Pennsylvania State University) for providing purified WT DHFR for the control experiments."

To understand this activity further, the high affinity nucleotide binding activity of SecA was characterized. We found that at 4 °C SecA homodimer binds one ADP molecule with high affinity. This nucleotide binding activity was conformationally regulated by temperature: at low temperature SecA affinity for ADP was high with a slow exchange rate, whereas at high temperature the converse was true. Azi- and PrlD-SecA proteins that confer azide-resistant and signal sequence suppressor phenotypes were found to have reduced affinity for ADP and accelerated exchange rates compared with wild type SecA. Consistent with this observation, fluorescence and proteolysis studies indicated that these proteins had a conformationally relaxed state at a reduced temperature compared with SecA. The level of Azi- and PrlD-SecA protein was also elevated in inverted membrane vesicles where it displayed higher membrane ATPase activity.

The crystal structure is reported at 1.8 Å resolution of Escherichia coli ornithine transcarbamoylase in complex with the active derivative of phaseolotoxin fromPseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola,N δ-(N′-sulfodiaminophosphinyl)-l-ornithine. Electron density reveals that the complex is not a covalent adduct as previously thought. Kinetic data confirm thatN δ-(N′-sulfodiaminophosphinyl)-l-ornithine exhibits reversible inhibition with a half-life in the order of ∼22 h and a dissociation constant of K D = 1.6 × 10−12m at 37 °C and pH 8.0. Observed hydrogen bonding about the chiral tetrahedral phosphorus of the inhibitor is consistent only with the presence of the R enantiomer. A strong interaction is also observed between Arg57 Nε and the P-N-S bridging nitrogen indicating that imino tautomers ofN δ-(N′-sulfodiaminophosphinyl)-l-ornithine are present in the bound state. An imino tautomer ofN δ-(N′-sulfodiaminophosphinyl)-l-ornithine is structurally analogous to the proposed reaction transition state. Hence, we propose thatN δ-(N′-sulfodiaminophosphinyl)-l-ornithine, with its three unique N-P bonds, represents a true transition state analogue for ornithine transcarbamoylases, consistent with the tight binding kinetics observed. ornithine transcarbamoylase aspartate transcarbamoylase carbamoyl phosphate noncrystallographic symmetry L-ornithine N-(phosphonacetyl)-l-aspartate N δ-(phosphonacetyl)-l-ornithine N δ-(N′-sulfodiaminophosphinyl)-l-ornithine root mean squared substrate-binding domain N-tris[hydroxymethyl]methyl-3-aminopropanesulfonic acid transition state Ornithine transcarbamoylase (OTCase, ornithine carbamoyltransferase; E.C. 2.1.3.3)1 catalyzes the reaction between carbamoyl phosphate (CP) and l-ornithine (Orn) to form l-citrulline and phosphate (Fig.1 a). In plants and microbes OTCase is involved in arginine biosynthesis, whereas in mammals it is located in the mitochondria and is part of the urea cycle. Although not thermodynamically favored, the reverse reaction is efficiently catalyzed by a specialized catabolic OTCase (1.Legrain C. Stallon V. Noullez J.P. Mercenier A. Simon J.P. Broman K. Wiame J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 80: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This activity is found in microbes that possess the arginine deiminase pathway, which enables the generation of ATP under anaerobic conditions (2.Stalon V. Mercenier A. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1984; 130: 69-76PubMed Google Scholar). OTCase is closely related to some other carbamoyltransferases, most notably aspartate transcarbamoylase (ATCase, aspartate carbamoyltransferase; E.C. 2.1.3.2) (3.Houghton J.E. Bencini D.A. O'Donovan G. Wild J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 4864-4868Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the key allosteric pyrimidine biosynthetic enzyme. The catalytic subunits of transcarbamoylases are composed of two domains: a CP-binding domain and an amino acid-binding domain. Each of the two discrete substrate-binding domains (SBDs) have an α/β topology with a central β-pleated sheet embedded in flanking α-helices. The basic quaternary structure is a trimer, with active sites located at the interface between the protein monomers (4.Honzatko R.B. Crawford J.L. Monaco H.L. Ladner J.E. Ewards F.P. Evans D.R.

S. A. 1995; 92: 10762-10766Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Anabolic OTCase is the simplest form of the enzyme, comprising a single homotrimeric unit (1.Legrain C. Stallon V. Noullez J.P. Mercenier A. Simon J.P. Broman K. Wiame J.M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 80: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), whereas the catabolic OTCase is a dodecamer of four trimers in a tetrahedral arrangement (5.Villeret V. Tricot C. Stalon V. Dideberg O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10762-10766Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). ATCase is also a dodecamer with two trimers and three regulatory dimers (4.Honzatko R.B. Crawford J.L. Monaco H.L. Ladner J.E. Ewards F.P. Evans D.R. Warren S.G. Wiley D.C. Ladner R.C. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 160: 219-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Amino acid sequences and resultant structures of the CP-binding domains are very closely related within this transcarbamoylase family. Conservation of key substrate-binding residues suggests that these transcarbamoylases share a common chemical mechanism. OTCase has a compulsory ordered mechanism with CP the first substrate to bind and phosphate the last product released (6.Miller A.W. Kuo L.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 265: 15023-15027Google Scholar, 7.Parmentier L.E. Kristensen J.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Protein Struct. Mol.

Lipscomb W.N. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4754-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The enzyme fromEscherichia coli W follows a Theorell-Chance mechanism where the concentration of the ternary complex is kinetically insignificant (8.Legrain C. Stalon V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 63: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). pH studies indicate that only the Orn zwitterion with an uncharged δ-amino group binds productively to OTCase (9.Kuo L.C. Herzberg W. Lipscomb W.N. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4754-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The chemical mechanism involves a nucleophilic attack from the electron pair of the δ-amino group of Orn on the carbonyl group of CP. The transition state (TS) is postulated to involve an oxyanion tetrahedral intermediate (Fig. 1 a) (10.Parmentier L.E. Weiss P.M. O'Leary M.H. Schachman H.K. Cleland W.W.

The roles of active site residues in stabilizing an oxyanion intermediate are unknown, but two conserved arginine residues contribute positive charges to the active site. Whereas Arg106 is thought to interact with the carbonyl oxygen of CP, Arg57 is also implicated in catalysis. Mutation of Arg57 to Gly results in poor catalytic efficiency with k cat reduced by ∼104 (12.Goldsmith J.O. Lee S. Zambidis I. Kuo L.C. J. Biol.

Specifically, in OTCases, the binding of substrates and/or inhibitors induces a conformational change in the 240s loop 2Nomenclature used to describe secondary structure and loop regions is as previously defined (14.Ha Y.

N δ-(N′-Sulfodiaminophosphinyl)-l-ornithine (PSOrn; Fig. 1 b) is an extremely potent inhibitor of OTCases from a variety of sources (20.Ferguson A.R. Johnston J.S. Physiol. Plant Pathol. 1980; 16: 269-275Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 21.Templeton M.D. Mitchell R.E. Sullivan P.A. Shepherd M.G. Biochem. J. 1985; 228: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). PSOrn is produced by aminopeptidase cleavage of phaseolotoxin, the tripeptide phytotoxin produced by the bean pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv.phaseolicola (22.Mitchell R.E. Bieleski R.L. Plant Physiol. 1977; 60: 723-729Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Mitchell R.E. Nature. 1976; 260: 75-76Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). PSOrn has an unusual structure involving three N-P bonds (24.Moore R.E. Niemczura W.P. Kwok O.C.H. Patil S.S. Tetrahedron Lett. 1984; 25: 3931-3934Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar) but has structural similarities to PALO and to the substrates of OTCase. OTCase is inactivated by PSOrn stoichiometrically, and it was suggested that this interaction might be via a covalent linkage (21.Templeton M.D. Mitchell R.E. Sullivan P.A. Shepherd M.G. Biochem. J. 1985; 228: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). To characterize the nature of this interaction, we have crystallized the OTCase-PSOrn complex and refined the structure at high resolution. Implications for the chemical mechanism of transcarbamoylases are discussed. The argIcoding sequence from E. coli K12 was polymerase chain reaction-amplified from the plasmid pAI102 (25.Bencini D.A. Houghton J.E. Hoover T.A. Foltermann K.F. Wild J.R. O'Donovan G.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 8509-8518Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and cloned into the expression vector pKK223–3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Expression levels of up to 100 mg of OTCase/liter of culture were obtained. The bisubstrate analogue for OTCase, PALO was synthesized as described by de Martinas et al. (26.de Martinis M.L. McIntyre P. Hoogenraad N. Biochem. Int. 1981; 3: 371-378Google Scholar) and linked to epoxy-activated Sepharose 6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). OTCase was purified to homogeneity in a one-step affinity procedure as described by Templetonet al. (27.Templeton M.D. Sullivan P.A. Shepherd M.G. Biochem. J. 1984; 224: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), except that the extraction buffer was 50 mm TAPS, pH 8.0, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. OTCase was assayed in 50 mm TAPS, pH 8.0, 5 mm CP and 3 mmOrn, using colorimetric determination of citrulline (27.Templeton M.D. Sullivan P.A. Shepherd M.G. Biochem. J. 1984; 224: 379-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Purified enzyme had a specific activity between 1250 and 1450 units/mg protein under these conditions. The mass of the purified OTCase monomer was determined as 36,775.2 (± 1.0) Da (calculated 36,775.65) using a LC-Q electrospray mass spectrometer (Finnigan, San Jose, CA). Unlabeled PSOrn was prepared as previously reported (23.Mitchell R.E. Nature. 1976; 260: 75-76Crossref Scopus (26) Google Scholar). [14C]PSOrn was purified from an 150-ml culture filtrate of P. syringae pv.phaseolicola ICMP 4419 grown on minimal medium at 18 °C. After 2.5 days of growth 20 μCi of [U-14C]-l-Orn (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added, and the culture was harvested 12 h later.14C-Labeled phaseolotoxin was purified by chromatography on quaternary aminoethyl- and LH-20 Sephadex (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Approximately 2% of the PSOrn was radiolabeled. [14C]phaseolotoxin (0.75 mg) was reacted with 4 units of leucine aminopeptidase (Sigma) in 200 μl of 25 mmammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.8, for 16 h. Completion of the reaction was confirmed by two-dimensional thin layer chromatography. The reaction mixture was loaded onto a quaternary aminoethyl-Sephadex column, and [14C]PSOrn was eluted with a 0.05–0.5m ammonium bicarbonate gradient. OTCase (20 nmol) was inactivated with [14C]PSOrn (25 nmol) in 50 mm TAPS, pH 8.0. The inactivated OTCase was desalted on a PD-10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), filter sterilized, and incubated with a 200-fold excess of unlabeled PSOrn in 50 mm TAPS, pH 8.0, at 37 °C. Samples were removed at the appropriate times and desalted on a PD-10 column to remove free [14C]PSOrn, and the 14C in the void volume was measured. 14C samples were counted for 10 min in an LKB 1214 Rackbeta liquid scintillation counter (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Equimolar concentrations of OTCase and PSOrn (1 nm) were incubated in 1 ml of 50 mm TAPS, pH 8.0, at 37 °C. Portions (50 μl) were removed at 30-s intervals and assayed for OTCase activity. Results were plotted as 1/e − 1/e 0 against time, wheree o is the initial concentration of enzyme ande is the concentration of active enzyme at timet. The slope of this line equals the observed second-order rate constant (28.Arisawa M. Then R. Biochem. J. 1983; 209: 609-615Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 29.Knott-Hunziker V. Orlek B.S. Sammes P.G. Waley S.G. Biochem. J. 1980; 187: 797-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) for the binding of PSOrn to OTCase. Purified OTCase (5–10 mg) was incubated with a 50% molar excess of PSOrn for 30 min at 0 °C. Enzyme activity was inhibited by >99% under these conditions. Inactivated enzyme was desalted on a PD-10 column equilibrated in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and frozen. The screening of conditions for crystal growth was conducted using the hanging drop vapor diffusion technique under normal oxidizing conditions at room temperature. Crystals most suitable for structure determination were obtained when equal volumes of protein (8 mg/ml) were combined with an aqueous solution containing polyethylene glycol 8000 17.8% (w/v) and polyethylene glycol 1000 2.2% (w/v) at pH 5.5 (mother liquor). After 1–2 weeks pyramidal crystal forms were observed. Such large irregular crystals were prepared for cryo conditions by equilibration (5–10 min) in a solution containing 21% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (8000:1000 as detailed for the mother liquor), with 20% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol as cryoprotectant. Cryoprotected crystals were flash frozen in a stream of nitrogen at −160 °C. The x-ray diffraction intensities were recorded with an R-Axis II detector (MSC, The Woodlands, TX) to a resolution of 1.7 Å. The data were reducible with R merge = 4.6% (23.5%) and 86% (35%) completeness with I/ς = 18.7 (2.9) (values in parentheses for the 1.76–1.70 Å shell) in a primitive orthorhombic cell (a = 86.7,b = 134.2, c = 109.3 Å). Systematic absences for (h 0 0) and (0 k 0) but not for (0 0 l) reflections indicated that the space group was probably P21212. This space group was confirmed by translation function results detailed below. The asymmetric unit of the observed cell contains one OTCase trimer, and the volume is ∼50% occupied by solvent. The primitive orthorhombic data were probed by molecular replacement using the program Amore (30.Navaza J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar) with trimeric search models derived (excluding PALO and solvent) from the 2.8 Å resolution crystal structures of PALO-liganded E. coli OTCase (14.Ha Y. McCann M.T. Tuchman M. Allewell N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9550-9555Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and the apo enzyme (18.Jin L. Seaton B.A. Head J.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 622-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank entries 2OTC and 1AKM, respectively). A significant peak (more than twice the next largest peak) was observed in the cross-rotation functions calculated from 8–4 Å resolution with both search models using a 40 Å sphere radius. Translation searches were conducted with data from 8 to 4 Å resolution in space groupsP222, P21212 andP2122, and a unique solution was identified inP21212. The PALO-liganded E. coli OTCase search model gave an optimal fit with a correlation coefficient of 0.57 against backgrounds of maxima at 0.30. Rigid body refinement of the search model with data to 2.3 Å increased the correlation coefficient to 0.63 (r = 36% andR free = 37%). A SigmaA (31.Read R.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1986; 42: 140-149Crossref Scopus (2035) Google Scholar) weightedF o − F c map revealed a pair of dominant peaks (>11ς) at each of the three CP-binding domains in the trimer matching the phosphorus and sulfur atoms of bound PSOrn. Refinement of atomic positions and B-factors was carried out using Crystallography and NMR System, Version 0.5 (32.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16947) Google Scholar). The structural model output from Amore was subjected to 600 steps of torsion angle molecular dynamics with a starting temperature of 2500 K. This resulted in r = 28% and R free = 32% using all data to 2.3 Å. From these coordinates one monomer was selected and the noncrystallographic symmetry (NCS) operators required to generate the other two monomers were calculated. Strict NCS constraints were then applied. The phosphorus and sulfur atoms previously identified were included in the model with r= 31% and R free = 32% at 2.3 Å resolution. Subsequent refinement and inclusion of data to 2.0 Å resulted inr = 32% and R free = 33%. The trimer was generated, and NCS restraints were applied. Energy minimization and B-refinement resulted in r= 28% and R free = 31% at 2.0 Å resolution. At this stage water molecules were gradually incorporated into the model. An electron density feature was modeled as a water molecule if it was >4 ς (3.5 ς in the final stages) in F o −F c maps and made at least one hydrogen bonding contact in the range 2.5–3.5 Å. Subsequent refinement using the data to 1.8 Å resolution reduced R andR free to 25 and 27%, respectively, and resulted in F o − F c electron density around the binding site as shown in Fig.2. PSOrn was modeled into this density. A search of the Cambridge Structural Data Base using various fragments of the PSOrn structure resulted in one related compound, bis(di-isopropylamino)-(phenyl(trifluoro-methylsulfonyl)amino)phosphine oxide. Values for P-N, P=O, N-S, and S=O bond-lengths, as well as relevant bond angles, were obtained from this crystal structure (33.Burford, N., Spence, R. E. v. H., and Richardson, J. F. (1991) J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans. 1615–1619Google Scholar) and used as initial refinement restraints in Crystallography and NMR System Version 0.5. During the final stages of refinement, these restraints were removed, and the bond lengths and angles were restrained to be identical in each of the three PSOrn molecules in the trimer of OTCase. Further rounds of refinement including manual model adjustments, removal of NCS restraints, and addition of more water molecules resulted in r = 19.2% andR free = 22.1% using all data to 1.7 Å. For the last cycles the reflections used for R free were included in the refinement resulting in r = 19.4%. The final model contains three OTCase monomers, three PSOrn molecules, 735 water molecules, and one molecule of 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. The RMS deviations from dictionary bond lengths and bond angles are 0.012 Å and 1.5°, respectively. The OTCase-PSOrn monomer conformation closely resembles that observed in the 2.8 Å crystal structure of theE. coli OTCase-PALO complex (14.Ha Y. McCann M.T. Tuchman M. Allewell N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9550-9555Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In both structures the relative orientations of the SBDs are observed to be almost equivalent with OTCase in the “closed” subunit conformation (Fig.3). Superposing the individual SBDs of the PALO complex with the SBDs of subunits G, H, and I of the PSOrn structure leaves RMS differences of 0.4, 0.4, and 0.3 Å, respectively for the 133 Cα atoms comprising the CP-binding domain, and RMS differences of 0.4, 0.4, and 0.4 Å for the 185 Cα atoms comprising the Orn-binding domain. These RMS differences are comparable with those obtained when the entire subunits of the two tertiary structures are superposed, with RMS differences of 0.4, 0.4, and 0.4 Å for 318 Cα atomic positions, indicating the general equivalence of the relative subunit conformations. Some small but significant differences are observed in the quaternary arrangement of the three subunits of the OTCase-PSOrn trimer when compared with the strictly NCS averagedE. coli OTCase-PALO homotrimer (14.Ha Y. McCann M.T. Tuchman M. Allewell N.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9550-9555Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although some deviation from exact three fold symmetry is evident at high resolution in the enzyme-PSOrn trimer, each of the three subunits are still closely related, superposing with an RMS difference of 0.3 Å for 332 Cα atoms. Two of the three subunits (H and I) can be superposed by a rotation of 120.1°, whereas the third subunit (G) is orientated away from the approximate 3-fold axis and is related to the other two subunits by rotations of 120.4 and 119.5°, respectively. A detailed comparison of the structures of the three independent subunits G, H, and I reveals some small differences. As reported in other transcarbamoylase structures, the 80-s loop from a neighboring subunit of the trimer (Fig. 3, shown in red), protrudes into each of the three CP-binding sites to form an intersubunit active site (4.Honzatko R.B. Crawford J.L. Monaco H.L. Ladner J.E. Ewards F.P. Evans D.R. Warren S.G. Wiley D.C. Ladner R.C. Lipscomb W.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 160: 219-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). However, in the crystals analyzed here there are indications that the sulfur atom of Met236, which interacts with the neighboring subunits 80s loop (Fig. 3), is oxidized to either a sulfoxide or sulfone. The varying levels of residual difference electron densities within 2 Å of the sulfur atoms of Met236 suggest that the extent of oxidation is not equivalent in each of the three subunits, with G > I > H. The electron density for the 80s loop in the I subunit (interacting with Met236 of the G subunit) is weak and is consistent with the higher temperature factors (>50 Å2) as compared with corresponding loops in subunits G and H. Only the side chain of Lys86 within this loop of subunit I is modeled in a conformation different to the well defined conformations observed in subunits G and H. Nearby, helix 9a is located on the periphery of the trimer and interacts with the 240s loop and a neighboring 80s loop (Fig. 3, pink). Ordered conformations of helix 9a are observed in subunits H and I and are directly involved in crystal packing. However, in the G subunit helix 9a is partially disordered with no observed electron density for parts of the main chain and most of the side chains. Because of the crystal packing, there are no possible partners for interactions with helix 9a of the G subunit. Side chains of helix 9a within subunits H and I interact via a number of salt bridges (3 and 1, respectively) to other trimers in the crystal. Other crystal packing effects may also be relevant to the small deviation from exact 3-fold symmetry of the OTCase-PSOrn trimer. In the asymmetric unit of the cell a single MPD molecule is observed to form hydrogen bonds bridging two crystallographically related trimers. The C-terminal amino acid carboxylate of subunit G (Lys333) is linked via this bridge to the side chain of Lys151 of subunit H. The observed electron densities and refined temperature factors for almost all of the amino acid side chains surrounding the three crystallographically independent PSOrn molecules are consistent with single conformations (other than the 80s loop of subunit I discussed above). Pairwise superposition of 13 Cα atoms adjacent (5 Å) to bound PSOrn molecules allows a precise (RMS difference of 0.2 Å for 121 atoms) comparison of the substrate-binding sites in each of the three subunits (not shown). In superposing the active sites, the largest and most significant difference (>0.2 Å) is observed in the CP-binding site of subunit G, whose guanidinium of Arg57, in comparison with its position in the other subunits, is displaced laterally with respect to PSOrn by 0.4 Å. The carboxylate conformation of the nearby Glu87 (I subunit) is also altered to preserve an intersubunit (I-G) salt bridge. Despite these small differences, the same set of interactions with identically placed and structured PSOrn molecules are observed in each of the three independent active sites (Table I).Table IIntermolecular atomic distances observed for nonhydrogen atoms at the PSOrn binding sites in subunits G, H, and LPSOrn atomPartner atomSubunit G distanceSubunit H distanceSubunit I distanceÅÅÅHydrogen bondsOThr56N2.72.82.7Arg57 N2.92.82.8Arg57 NH22.93.03.0O1Arg106NH12.83.02.8Gln82*NE22.83.12.9O2Ser55OG2.62.72.6Thr58 N2.92.82.9Thr58 OG13.13.03.1N2Arg57NE2.82.82.8O3Thr58OG13.03.03.1Arg106NH22.72.82.8His133NE22.82.82.7NGln136OE12.82.72.6Cys273 O2.72.72.8N3Asn167 OD12.82.92.9Asp231 OD22.72.72.5Ser235OG2.92.72.8O4Met236 N2.82.82.8Wat3.02.82.8O5Asn167ND22.83.03.0Wat2.72.72.7Other possible interactionsNArg319 NH13.13.13.1Leu274 O3.13.13.1N1Leu274O3.03.03.0O13.13.13.1O3Arg319 NH13.02.93.1The intramolecular distance between the oxygen (O1) of the sulfamyl group and the nitrogen (N1) of PSOrn is also given.

Open table in a new tab The intramolecular distance between the oxygen (O1) of the sulfamyl group and the nitrogen (N1) of PSOrn is also given. Gln82* is the residue from another subunit of the trimer. Other close contacts with hydrogen bond donors not orientated ideally to form a strong hydrogen bond are also listed as possible interactions. PSOrn occupies the adjacent Orn- and CP-binding sites found in the closed conformation of each of the three subunits. Electron density clearly defines the positions of all nonhydrogen atoms in each PSOrn molecule (Fig. 2), and there is no evidence of covalent attachment to the enzyme as previously postulated (21.Templeton M.D. Mitchell R.E. Sullivan P.A. Shepherd M.G. Biochem. J. 1985; 228: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Instead, PSOrn interacts noncovalently with substrate-binding residues, consistent with kinetic experiments, which show that PSOrn competes for the CP-binding site of OTCase (21.Templeton M.D. Mitchell R.E. Sullivan P.A. Shepherd M.G. Biochem. J. 1985; 228: 347-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Around the active site, the E. coli PSOrn-OTCase structure closely parallels that reported at 1.85 Å resolution for PALO bound to human OTCase (Fig. 4 a) (11.Shi D. Morizono H. Ha Y. Aoyagi M.

Gln82 of E. coli OTCase is not conserved in OTCases, and the intersubunit interactions of its side chain are substituted by similar interactions of the imidazole of His117 in human OTCase. Additionally, the conformation of the side chain amide of Gln136 is inverted when compared with the conformation reported for Gln171 in the human enzyme (11.Shi D. Morizono H. Ha Y. Aoyagi M.

The lectins included those from Canavalia brasiliensis, Cratylia floribunda, Dioclea rostrata, Dioclea virgata, Dioclea violacea, and Dioclea guianensis. All of the lectins exhibited specificity for Man and Glc residues, but much higher affinities for the branched chain trimannoside, 3,6-di-O-(α-d-mannopyranosyl)-d-mannose, which is found in the core region of all asparagine-linked carbohydrates. In the present study, isothermal titration microcalorimetry is used to determine the binding thermodynamics of the above lectins, including a new lectin from Canavalia grandiflora, to a complete series of monodeoxy analogs of the core trimannoside. From losses in the affinity constants and enthalpies of binding of certain deoxy analogs, assignments are made of the hydroxyl epitopes on the trimannoside that are involved in binding to the lectins. The pattern of binding of the deoxy analogs is similar for all seven lectins, and similar to that of concanavalin A which is also a member of the Diocleinae subtribe. However, differences in the magnitude of the thermodynamic binding parameters of the lectins are observed, even though the lectins possess conserved contact residues in many cases, and highly conserved primary sequences. The results indicate that non-contact residues in the lectins, even those distant from the binding sites, modulate their thermodynamic binding parameters.

Lis H. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3198-3208Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Many possess distinct monosaccharide binding specificities, but even those with the same nominal monosaccharide specificity often possess different specificities for larger naturally occurring oligosaccharides. For example, Leguminosae lectins from the Diocleinae subtribe such as concanavalin A (ConA)1 as well as the seed lectin from Dioclea grandiflora (DGL), and lectins from the Vicieae tribe such as the sweet pea, garden pea, lentil, and fava bean lectins all bind the monosaccharide Man. However, ConA and DGL have recently been shown to possess much higher affinities for the “core” trimannoside, 3,6-di-O-(α-d-mannopyranosyl)-d-mannose, of asparagine-linked (N-linked) carbohydrates (2.Chervenak M.C.

However, studies of the fine binding specificity of the two lectins demonstrate that they possess divergent specificities for longer chain complex carbohydrates, with ConA showing 20-fold higher affinity for 12 (Fig.1) (7.Dam T.K.

Seven other Man/Glc-specific lectins of the Diocleinae subtribe from different genera and species have recently been isolated and partially characterized (Scheme FS1). The lectins are from Canavalia brasiliensis, Canavalia grandiflora,Cratylia floribunda, Dioclea rostrata, Dioclea virgata, Dioclea violacea, and Dioclea guianensis.

Although the complete primary sequences of all of the Diocleinae lectins are not known, the high degree of sequence homologies of ConA, DGL, C. brasiliensis, C. floribunda, and D. guianensis and conservation of their sugar binding residues for the core trimannoside (Fig. 2) (18.Calvete J.J.

Indeed, the importance of determining the fine binding specificities of Diocleinae lectins led to the observation that the relative affinities of the lectins from C. brasiliensis, C. bonariensis, C. floribunda, D. rostrata, D. virgata, D. violacea, and D. guianensis for complex carbohydrate12 (Fig. 1) correlated with their relative histamine release activities in rat peritoneal mast cells (7.Dam T.K.

Furthermore, the x-ray crystal structure of DGL complexed to 1 showed binding of the same contact residues, and the same overall conformation of the trimannoside (6.Rozwarski D.A. Swami B.M. Brewer C.F. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32818-32825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, the ITC data for the two lectins binding to1 and 2-11 showed differences in the magnitude of the thermodynamic parameters to certain deoxy analogs, which could not be explained on the basis of differential solvation of the complexes in their respective binding sites (27.Dam T.K.

The present study reports ITC studies of the binding of lectins fromC. brasiliensis, C. floribunda, D. rostrata, D. virgata, D. violacea, and D. guianensis to deoxy analogs2-11 (Fig. 1). Data are also reported for a new Man/Glc-specific lectin from C. grandiflora. The results indicate that all seven new Diocleinae lectins possess conserved epitope recognition of 1 similar to that of ConA and DGL, as suggested by previous hemagglutination inhibition studies (7.Dam T.K.

However, the magnitude of the thermodynamic data differ for all seven Diocleinae lectins, and from that previously reported for ConA and DGL (26.Dam T.K. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol.

Trimannoside 1 was obtained from Sigma. Biantennary complex carbohydrate (12) was purchased from Dextra Laboratories Ltd., United Kingdom. The syntheses of oligosaccharides2–11 have been previously described (28.Oscarson S. Tedebark U. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 278: 271-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The concentrations of carbohydrates were measured by the phenol-sulfuric acid method using an appropriate mixture of Man, Glc, and Gal as the standard (29.Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K.

Purity of the oligosaccharides was checked by1H NMR spectroscopy (28.Oscarson S. Tedebark U. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 278: 271-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Seeds of all the species were obtained from the States of Ceara and Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Lectins were purified by affinity chromatography using Sephadex G-50, as described previously (31.Agrawal B.B.L. Goldstein I.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1967; 147: 262-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar). Concentrations of the lectins were determined spectrophotometrically at 280 nm and expressed in terms of monomer. The A1 cm1% at pH 7.2 and subunit molecular mass of the lectins used are as follows: 10.47 and 26 kDa (C. brasiliensis), 10.2 and 26.0 kDa (C. grandiflora) (determined in the present study), 11.36 and 29.5 kDa (C. floribunda), 11.22 and 30 kDa (D. rostrata), 10.50 and 30 kDa (D. guianensis), 10.19 and 30.kDa (D. virgata), and 9.75 and 29.5 kDa (D. violacea) (7.Dam T.K.

ITC experiments were performed using an isothermal titration calorimeter of the new MCS system from Microcal, Inc. (Northampton, MA). In individual titrations, injections of 4 μl of carbohydrate were added from the computer-controlled 250- or 100-μl microsyringe at an interval of 4 min into the lectin solution (cell volume = 1.358 ml) dissolved in the same buffer as the saccharide, while stirring at 350 rpm. An example of an ITC experiment is shown in Fig.3 for binding of 5 to C. floribunda at 27 °C. Control experiments performed by making identical injections of saccharide into a cell containing buffer with no protein showed insignificant heats of dilution. The experimental data were fitted to a theoretical titration curve using software supplied by Microcal, with ΔH (enthalpy change in kcal mol−1), K a (association constant inm−1) and n (number of binding sites per monomer), as adjustable parameters. The quantity c= K a M t(0), whereM t(0) is the initial macromolecule concentration, is of importance in titration microcalorimetry (32.Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandt J.F. Lin L.-N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar). All experiments were performed with c values 1 < c < 200. The instrument was calibrated using the calibration kit containing ribonuclease A (RNase A) and cytidine 2′-monophosphate supplied by the manufacturer. Thermodynamic parameters were calculated from the equation,ΔG=ΔH−TΔS=−RT lnKaEquation 1 where ΔG, ΔH, and ΔS are the changes in free energy, enthalpy, and entropy of binding.T is the absolute temperature and R = 1.98 cal mol−1 K−1.

Results from hemagglutination inhibition studies of the lectins using deoxy analogs2-11 suggested that the 3-, 4-, and 6-hydroxyls of the α(1–6)Man, the 3- and 4-hydroxyls of the α(1–3)Man and the 2- and 4-hydroxyls of the central Man of trimannoside 1 are involved in binding with the above Diocleinae lectins (7.Dam T.K.

These findings tentatively concluded that the lectins possessed an extended binding site for 1 that is similar to that observed for ConA and DGL (26.Dam T.K. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab Interactions of the α(1–6) arm of trimannoside 1 with C. brasiliensis, C. grandiflora, C. floribunda, D. rostrata, D. virgata, D. violacea, and D. guianensis were investigated using deoxy analogs6-9 (Fig. 1). Table I shows the thermodynamic binding parameters of the analogs with the lectins. TheK a values for the α(1–6) 3-deoxy (7), α(1–6) 4-deoxy (8), and α(1–6) 6-deoxy (9) analogs are significantly lower than that of 1 for all seven lectins. For example, the K a value of C. brasiliensis binding to 1 is 3.7 × 105m−1, while theK a values for 7, 8, and9 are 2.7 × 104m−1, 3.6 × 104m−1, and 3.9 × 104m−1, respectively. On the other hand, theK a values of the lectins for 6, the α(1–6) 2-deoxy analog, are little changed from that of 1. For example, the K a value of C. brasiliensis binding to 6 is 1.4 × 104m−1, only somewhat lower than that of 1. The enthalpy of binding (−ΔH) values of the lectins to7, 8, and 9 are also lower relative to1 (Table I). For example, the difference in ΔHvalues (ΔΔH) for C. brasiliensis binding to7, 8, and 9 are 5.5 kcal mol−1, 5.3 kcal mol−1, and 4.1 kcal mol−1, respectively, relative to 1 (Table I). However, ΔΔH values of the lectins binding to analog6 are much smaller. For example, the ΔΔHvalue of C. brasiliensis binding to 6 is 0.8 kcal mol−1. ΔΔH values of 1.0 kcal mol−1 or less for deoxy analogs are considered too small to be evidence for H-bonding interactions of the corresponding hydroxyl group (26.Dam T.K. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32812-32817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These findings support the involvement of the 3-, 4-, and 6-hydroxyl groups of the α(1–6) Man of 1, but not the 2-hydroxyl, in binding to all seven Diocleinae lectins. The results also suggest that the α(1–6)Man residue of 1 occupies the so-called “monosaccharide-binding site” in all of the lectins, since the 3-, 4-, and 6-hydroxyl groups of Man and Glc have been shown to be required for binding to ConA (33.Goldstein I.J. Poretz R.D. Liener I.E. Sharon N. Goldstein I.J. The Lectins. Academic Press, Inc., New York1986: 35-244Google Scholar). The presence of the α(1–6)Man of 1 bound in the monosaccharide-binding site of ConA and DGL, two other members of the Diocleinae subtribe, have been confirmed by x-ray crystallography (5.Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 6.Rozwarski D.A. Swami B.M. Brewer C.F. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32818-32825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The structures of these two complexes is shown in Fig. 4 for comparison. Deoxy analogs 2, 3, 4, and 5 (Fig. 1) were used to determined the involvement of the 2-, 3-, 4-, and 6-hydroxyl groups of α(1–3)Man of 1, respectively, in binding to the lectins. Only analog 3 exhibits consistent reductions in itsK a and ΔH values relative to1 with the lectins (Table I). For example, theK a value of C. brasiliensis binding to3 is 6.0 × 104m−1, which is nearly 6-fold lower than that of1. In comparison, analogs 2, 4, and5 show 2-fold or less reductions in theirK a values. Similarily, 3 exhibits a larger loss in ΔH (ΔΔH) values with the lectins relative to the other three analogs (Table I). For example, the loss in ΔΔH for 3 binding to C. brasiliensis is 2.5 kcal/mol as compared with 0.8, 1.2, and 0.8 kcal/mol for 2, 4, and 5,respectively. These findings thus suggest that the 3-hydroxyl of the α(1–3)Man of 1 binds to the seven Diocleinae lectins in Table I. Importantly, the x-ray crystal structures of ConA and DGL complexed with the core trimannoside (5.Naismith J.H. Field R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 972-976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 6.Rozwarski D.A. Swami B.M. Brewer C.F. Sacchettini J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32818-32825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) show that the 3-hydroxyl of the α(1–3)Man of 1 is involved in H-bonds with conserved contact residues of two lectins (Fig. 4). However, the x-ray data for both trimannoside complexes also indicate the involvement of the 4-hydroxyl of the α(1–3)Man of 1 in H-bonds to the ConA and DGL (Fig. 4). ITC data for binding of ConA (25.Gupta D. Dam T.K. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6388-6392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) to 4shows a 5-fold reduction in K a value and a loss in ΔΔH value of 2.1 kcal/mol relative to 1. ITC data for DGL binding to 4 shows a 2-fold reduction inK a and a loss in ΔΔH of 1.6 kcal/mol relative to 1 (26.Dam T.K. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32812-32817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Thus, although the x-ray crystal structures show the involvement of the 4-hydroxyl of the α(1–3)Man of 1 with both lectins, the thermodynamic data for4 suggests weaker interactions of the 4-hydroxyl with the two proteins. The thermodynamic data for 4 with the seven Diocleinae lectins in Table I also do not support strong interactions of the 4-hydroxyl group of the α(1–3)Man of 1 with the seven Diocleinae lectins in Table I. Interactions of the core Man residue of 1 with C. brasiliensis, C. grandiflora, C. floribunda, D. rostrata, D. virgata, D. violacea, and D. guianensis were investigated using deoxy analogs 10 and11 (Fig. 1).

The task of their structural analysis can thus be essentially reduced to the examination of tertiary contacts between membrane-embedded helices. Therefore, it appears valid to chose a hairpin (helix-loop-helix) structure as the minimal tertiary contact unit of analysis for determination of the extent and nature of helix-helix interactions that may arise in polytopic membrane proteins. For such analyses, studies with de novo designed peptides have demonstrated the feasibility of generating milligram amounts of synthetic TM segments using peptide constructs carrying terminal positive charges (6.Liu L.P. Li S.C. Goto N.K. Deber C.M. Biopolymers. 1996; 39: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 7.Liu L.P. Deber C.M. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 41-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As well, synthetic peptides allow for wide mutation possibilities without complications from requirements for cell viability.To explore the properties of isolated TM segments in a systematic manner, we have chosen M13 major coat protein for a model study. This 50-residue protein (8.Nakashima Y. Frangione B. Wiseman R.L. Konigsberg W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5792-5797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is found in the capsid of filamentous coliphage M13 (9.Russel M. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1607-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). During phage assembly, the α-helical M13 coat proteins participate in an oligomerization process within Escherichia coli plasma membrane, which ultimately leads to the encapsulation of viral DNA (10.Spruijt R.B. Wolfs C.J. Hemminga M.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9158-9165Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 11.Spruijt R.B. Hemminga M.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11147-11154Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In vivo, the coat protein is expected to be oligomeric during the life cycle of M13, with the minimal structure of such oligomers being a dimer (12.Haigh N.G. Webster R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, in vitro the oligomerization state of the isolated WT M13 coat protein (and its relative, IKe coat protein) on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and other gels have been variously reported as monomers (13.McDonnell P.A.

Hemminga M.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12268-12275Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). That the wild type oligomeric state is condition-dependent suggests the likelihood of equilibration between various states but generally in the direction away from tight dimer formation to allow further propagation of oligomers.Previous mutagenesis studies on the M13 coat protein demonstrated that various Val → Ala mutations in the TM region have contrasting position-dependent effects on its helical stabilities. In particular, mutant V31A acquired an unusually large amount of thermal stability from this mutation, whereas the V29A mutant behaved very similarly to the WT (19.Deber C.M. Khan A.R. Li Z. Joensson C. Glibowicka M. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11648-11652Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Based on the mutagenesis results, the oligomerization-promoting helical interface of M13 coat protein was postulated to have a “two in-two out” motif24YAWAMVVVIVGATIGIKLF42(residues in the helix-helix interface are underlined) (19.Deber C.M. Khan A.R. Li Z. Joensson C. Glibowicka M. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11648-11652Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) conceptually analogous to that of the glycophorin A dimer (20.Lemmon M.A. Treutlein H.R. Adams P.D. Brünger A.T. Engelman D.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 21.MacKenzie K.R. Prestegard J.H. Engelman D.M. Science. 1997; 276: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar).As indicated above, M13 coat protein presents the advantage as a model system that helix-helix interactions can be assessed by the propensity of the micelle-embedded M13 protein to undergo a thermally induced α-helix → β-sheet transition (19.Deber C.M. Khan A.R. Li Z. Joensson C. Glibowicka M. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11648-11652Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In such experiments, heating disrupts both helix-membrane and helix-helix interactions, eventually allowing the TM segments to escape the micelle into the aqueous environment, where they aggregate rapidly to form β-sheets because of their extreme hydrophobic nature. Although the specific type and aggregation state of this β-form of M13 coat protein are not precisely known, Hemminga and colleagues (10.Spruijt R.B. Wolfs C.J. Hemminga M.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9158-9165Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) have reported that the β-aggregate consists of 440 strands upon heating WT M13 coat protein to 55 °C in 10 mm cholate. Thus, the clear β-sheet diagnostic CD spectra provide a useful assay for aggregation of the nascent water-based form of the protein as driven by the hydrophobic effect. Because helix-helix interactions become important only when relatively strong noncovalent dimers/oligomers pre-exist in the micelle, thermal stability can be used as a parameter to assess the sequence dependence of the intrinsic strength of inter-helical interactions.Based upon this overall knowledge of WT and mutant M13 coat proteins, we have de novo designed and synthesized a series of peptides which correspond to the presumed transmembrane segment (residues 24–42) of the M13 coat protein. If TM helices act as autonomous folding domains, with self-contained recognition faces that guide helix-helix packing, we are in a position to test the hypothesis that peptides comprised of isolated TM sequences should exhibit properties similar to those characteristic of the corresponding segments within the intact proteins. Observations that excised or co-expressed fragments of the transmembrane (TM)1 segments of multi-spanning membrane proteins can reconstitute to a functional form (1.Kahn T.W. Engelman D.M. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 6144-6151Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 2.Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7750-7755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Groves J.D.

The task of their structural analysis can thus be essentially reduced to the examination of tertiary contacts between membrane-embedded helices. Therefore, it appears valid to chose a hairpin (helix-loop-helix) structure as the minimal tertiary contact unit of analysis for determination of the extent and nature of helix-helix interactions that may arise in polytopic membrane proteins. For such analyses, studies with de novo designed peptides have demonstrated the feasibility of generating milligram amounts of synthetic TM segments using peptide constructs carrying terminal positive charges (6.Liu L.P. Li S.C. Goto N.K. Deber C.M. Biopolymers. 1996; 39: 465-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 7.Liu L.P. Deber C.M. Biopolymers. 1998; 47: 41-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As well, synthetic peptides allow for wide mutation possibilities without complications from requirements for cell viability. To explore the properties of isolated TM segments in a systematic manner, we have chosen M13 major coat protein for a model study. This 50-residue protein (8.Nakashima Y. Frangione B. Wiseman R.L. Konigsberg W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5792-5797Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is found in the capsid of filamentous coliphage M13 (9.Russel M. Mol. Microbiol. 1991; 5: 1607-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). During phage assembly, the α-helical M13 coat proteins participate in an oligomerization process within Escherichia coli plasma membrane, which ultimately leads to the encapsulation of viral DNA (10.Spruijt R.B. Wolfs C.J. Hemminga M.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9158-9165Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 11.Spruijt R.B. Hemminga M.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11147-11154Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In vivo, the coat protein is expected to be oligomeric during the life cycle of M13, with the minimal structure of such oligomers being a dimer (12.Haigh N.G. Webster R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 279: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, in vitro the oligomerization state of the isolated WT M13 coat protein (and its relative, IKe coat protein) on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and other gels have been variously reported as monomers (13.McDonnell P.A. Shon K. Kim Y. Opella S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 447-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 14.Williams K.A. Farrow N.A. Deber C.M. Kay L.E.

That the wild type oligomeric state is condition-dependent suggests the likelihood of equilibration between various states but generally in the direction away from tight dimer formation to allow further propagation of oligomers. Previous mutagenesis studies on the M13 coat protein demonstrated that various Val → Ala mutations in the TM region have contrasting position-dependent effects on its helical stabilities. In particular, mutant V31A acquired an unusually large amount of thermal stability from this mutation, whereas the V29A mutant behaved very similarly to the WT (19.Deber C.M. Khan A.R. Li Z. Joensson C. Glibowicka M. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11648-11652Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Based on the mutagenesis results, the oligomerization-promoting helical interface of M13 coat protein was postulated to have a “two in-two out” motif24YAWAMVVVIVGATIGIKLF42(residues in the helix-helix interface are underlined) (19.Deber C.M. Khan A.R. Li Z. Joensson C. Glibowicka M. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11648-11652Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) conceptually analogous to that of the glycophorin A dimer (20.Lemmon M.A. Treutlein H.R. Adams P.D. Brünger A.T. Engelman D.M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 157-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 21.MacKenzie K.R. Prestegard J.H. Engelman D.M. Science. 1997; 276: 131-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). As indicated above, M13 coat protein presents the advantage as a model system that helix-helix interactions can be assessed by the propensity of the micelle-embedded M13 protein to undergo a thermally induced α-helix → β-sheet transition (19.Deber C.M. Khan A.R. Li Z. Joensson C. Glibowicka M. Wang J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11648-11652Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In such experiments, heating disrupts both helix-membrane and helix-helix interactions, eventually allowing the TM segments to escape the micelle into the aqueous environment, where they aggregate rapidly to form β-sheets because of their extreme hydrophobic nature. Although the specific type and aggregation state of this β-form of M13 coat protein are not precisely known, Hemminga and colleagues (10.Spruijt R.B. Wolfs C.J. Hemminga M.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9158-9165Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) have reported that the β-aggregate consists of 440 strands upon heating WT M13 coat protein to 55 °C in 10 mm cholate. Thus, the clear β-sheet diagnostic CD spectra provide a useful assay for aggregation of the nascent water-based form of the protein as driven by the hydrophobic effect. Because helix-helix interactions become important only when relatively strong noncovalent dimers/oligomers pre-exist in the micelle, thermal stability can be used as a parameter to assess the sequence dependence of the intrinsic strength of inter-helical interactions. Based upon this overall knowledge of WT and mutant M13 coat proteins, we have de novo designed and synthesized a series of peptides which correspond to the presumed transmembrane segment (residues 24–42) of the M13 coat protein. If TM helices act as autonomous folding domains, with self-contained recognition faces that guide helix-helix packing, we are in a position to test the hypothesis that peptides comprised of isolated TM sequences should exhibit properties similar to those characteristic of the corresponding segments within the intact proteins. We are grateful to Alex Brünger and Paul Adams (Yale University) for providing us with the global conformation search program for the simulation of M13 dimers.

We previously identified a gene, rtoA, which when disrupted randomizes the cell cycle-dependent mechanism without affecting either the underlying cell cycle or asymmetric differentiation. We find that in wild-type cells, RtoA levels vary during the cell cycle. Cytosolic pH, which normally varies with the cell cycle, is randomized inrtoA cells. The middle 60% of the RtoA protein is 10 tandem repeats of an 11 peptide-long serine-rich motif, which we find has a random coil structure. This domain catalyzes the fusion of phospholipid vesicles in vitro. Conversely,rtoA cells have a defect in the fusion of endocytic vesicles. They also have a decreased exocytosis rate, a decreased pH of endocytic/exocytic vesicles, and an increased average cytosolic pH. Our data indicate that the serine-rich domain of RtoA can mediate membrane fusion and that RtoA can increase the rate of vesicle fusion during processing of endoctyic vesicles.

One of the simplest systems that exhibits this behavior is the eukaryoteDictyostelium discoideum. Dictyostelium lives as a single cell on soil surfaces that eats bacteria and divides by fission. When the cells overgrow an area and starve, they form an aggregate of ∼2 × 104 cells, which develops into a fruiting body consisting of two cell types: an approximately 2-mm column of stalk cells supporting a mass of spore cells. The initial differentiation of Dictyostelium cells occurs by a combination of asymmetric cell division and a musical chairs mechanism based on the cell cycle (1.Araki T. Nakao H. Takeuchi I. Maeda Y.

At the time of starvation, each pair of sister cells in S or early G2 phase differentiates into a prestalk cell and a null cell (a cell type that initially expresses neither prespore nor prestalk markers). Each pair of sister cells in the late G2 or M phase differentiates into a prespore cell and a null cell (Dictyostelium has an undetectable G1 phase; Ref. 9.Weijer C.J. Duschl G. David C.N. J. Cell Sci. 1984; 70: 111-131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This mechanism regulates only initial differentiation. The eventual fate of the cell is still plastic, and a variety of factors such as adenosine, ammonia, a chlorinated hydrocarbon called differentiation-inducing factor, and oxygen can change the final fate (10.Brookman J.J.

Using shotgun antisense (18.Spann T.P. Brock D.A. Lindsey D.F. Wood S.A. Gomer R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5003-5007Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), we identified a gene involved in the initial differentiation of Dictyostelium cells that we called rtoA. rtoA codes for a 39.8-kDa protein, with 11 perfect repeats of a 10-amino acid-long serine-rich acidic sequence, a possible N-terminal transmembrane domain, and a possible ATP/GTP-binding domain. The gene disruption mutant of rtoAhas a high prestalk:prespore ratio while maintaining a normal cell cycle. However, prestalk and prespore cells from rtoAdisruptants originate from cells in any phase of the cell cycle at starvation. As in wild-type cells, the sisters of the differentiated cells are all null in the rtoA mutant. These results suggest that RtoA is not involved in the asymmetric cell division mechanism or cell cycle progression but is involved in a process that varies during the cell cycle and can be monitored at starvation to select initial cell type (19.Wood S.A. Ammann R.R. Brock D.A. Li L. Spann T.P. Gomer R.H. Dev. 1996; 122: 3677-3685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One parameter that varies during the cell cycle and affects cell type choice is cytosolic pH (11.Gross J.D. Bradbury J. Kay R.R. Peacey M.J. Nature. 1983; 303: 244-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 20.Wang M. Roelfsema J.H. Williams J.G. Schaap P. Dev.

In synchronized populations, cells in M and S phases have a high pH (and tend to become prestalk), whereas cells in mid and late G2 have a low pH (and tend to become prespore) (22.Aerts R.J. Durston A.J. Moolenaar W.H. Cell. 1985; 43: 653-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Treating cells with bases or acids alters their initial differentiation toward becoming prestalk or prespore, respectively (22.Aerts R.J. Durston A.J. Moolenaar W.H. Cell. 1985; 43: 653-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,23.Aerts R.J. Durston A.J. Konijn T.M. J. Cell Sci. 1987; 87: 423-430Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By examining the effect of a variety of proton pump inhibitors on the plasma membrane H+-ATPase and cell fate, Gross et al. (24.Gross J.D. Peacey M.J. Pogge von Strandmann R. Differentiation. 1988; 38: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) hypothesized that cytosolic pH is linked to the pH of intracellular vesicles and that it is the pH of these vesicles that affects cell type choice. One set of vesicles that contain these pumps belongs to the pinocytosis/endosome/lysosome system (25.Giglione C. Gross J.D. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1995; 36: 1057-1065PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Nolta K.V. Steck T.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2225-2233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Padh H. Lavasa M. Steck T.L. J. Biol.

Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1479-1495Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). During endocytosis, endosomal vesicles merge with lysosomes and acidify. The ingested material appears to pass through nine or more compartments before being excreted (30.Aubry L. Klein G. Martiel J.L. Satre M. J. Theor. Biol. 1997; 184: 89-98Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This process depends upon proper vesicle fusion. In this paper, we show that there is a cell cycle- and sister cell-dependent expression of RtoA in the vegetative cell population. We find that a portion of RtoA has a random coil structure and is able to induce fusion of artificial membranes. We demonstrate that cells lacking RtoA are defective in the fusion of endosomal vesicles and correlate this with defects in endosomal vesicle and cytosolic pH regulation. We hypothesize that the cell cycle- and sister cell-specific expression of RtoA imposes a cell cycle- and sister cell-specific modulation of endosomal vesicle processing and cell physiology, which in turn results in a cell cycle- and sister cell-specific modulation of initial cell type choice. D. discoideum Ax4 wild-type andrtoA cells (19.Wood S.A. Ammann R.R. Brock D.A. Li L. Spann T.P. Gomer R.H. Dev. 1996; 122: 3677-3685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were grown as described previously (31.Jain R. Gomer R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9128-9136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with the exception that in the HL5 growth medium the peptone was a mix of 7.15 g of bacterial peptone (Oxoid Limited, Basingstoke, Hampshire, UK) and 7.15 g of BBL Thiotone E peptone (Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, MD)/liter, and the HL5 was supplemented, after autoclaving, with 20 μg/liter biotin, 5 μg/liter vitamin B12, 200 μg/liter folic acid, 400 μg/liter lipoic acid, 500 μg/liter riboflavin, and 600 μg/liter thiamine. A mixture of 0.3 g/liter streptomycin sulfate and 0.1 g/liter ampicillin was used as an antibiotic. The synthetic peptide SSGSSNSGSESSSDSGSSSDGKTT was conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and this was then used to immunize a rabbit at Biosynthesis Inc. (Lewisville, TX). Serum was collected 2 weeks after the fifth injection and was purified using an E-Z-Sep kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Cell fractionation and Western blots were done as described by Brocket al. (32.Brock D.A. Buczynski F. Spann T.P. Wood S.A. Cardelli J. Gomer R.H. Development. 1996; 122: 2569-2578Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to generate a DNA fragment for fusion protein production. To generate cDNA for the serine-rich region of RtoA (S fragment) coding for amino acids 52–271, the primer 5′-GCCTCGAGTGATTCAGATCCAGAG TTG-3′ was used. The above primer as well as 5′-GCAAGCTTCTTCAATTGGCTCATCTAG-3′ were used to amplify this DNA. The purified product was ligated into the expression vector pET23a (Novagen, Madison, WI) using the createdHindIII and XhoI sites. Fusion protein (S fragment) was induced and purified using a nickel-agarose column (Pierce) following the manufacturer's directions. After elution with a series of increasing imidazole concentrations, fractions containing the fusion protein were pooled and used for assays. These fractions consisted of >85% fusion protein. A similar procedure was performed to generate a fusion protein encoding the putative nucleotide binding domain (amino acids 295–376), except that the primers were 5′-GCCTCGAGATGGGTGACGTGGACC-3′ and 5′-GCAAGCTTCTGATAGTGGATCCTCATC-3′, respectively. RtoA was expressed throughout the cell cycle from the actin 15 promoter of a Dictyosteliumexpression vector. The primers 5′-GGGGTACCGTTTGGAATTTATATAGAAAATGTGC-3′ and 5′-GCTCTAGAGATTTAATGGTGACGTGGACC-3′ were used in a polymerase chain reaction to amplify genomic DNA encoding the complete rtoAsequence. The primers added Asp718 and XbaI sites at the 5′ and 3′ ends, respectively, of the amplified region. Following digestion with Asp718 and XbaI, the 1.6-kilobase polymerase chain reaction product was cloned in frame into theAsp718 and XbaI sites of the expression vector pDXA-3H, and the construct was verified by DNA sequencing. The construct was transformed into cells by electroporation, and freshly cloned cells were used for all experiments. Conditioned medium and PBM (20 mm KH2PO4, 10 μmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 6.1, with KOH) were prepared as described by Clay et al. (33.Clay J.L. Ammann R.A. Gomer R.H. Dev. Biol. 1995; 172: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Videomicroscopy, fixation of cells and immunofluorescence staining were done as described by Wood et al. (19.Wood S.A. Ammann R.R. Brock D.A. Li L. Spann T.P. Gomer R.H. Dev. 1996; 122: 3677-3685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following modifications. After videotaping for approximately 18 h, the growth medium was changed to 200 μl of 25% PBM in water, and 20 min later cells were fixed by adding 200 μl of 1% glutaraldehyde in Z buffer. After 3 min, the liquid was removed and replaced with 200 μl of 3.7% formaldehyde in Z buffer; after 10 min this was removed and replaced with 70% ethanol; the slide was then air-dried 10 min and stored in a desiccator at −20 °C. Alternatively, cells were fixed with 0.6% glutaraldehyde in PBM for 5 min, then 3.7% formaldehyde in PBM, then with a 1:2:1 mixture of 95% ethanol, water and PBM for 10 min, followed by 95% ethanol for 10 min, and then air drying as above. The slides were thawed, incubated with 53 mmNaBH4 (EM Sciences, Cherry Hill, NJ) for 5 min to reduce nonspecific fluorescence from the glutaraldehyde and then stained with anti-RtoA antibody as described above. For circular dichroism, 100 μl of either the S fragment in elution buffer or elution buffer alone as a control were concentrated and resuspended in 8 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.4. The volume was adjusted to 600 μl, and the ellipticity from 190 to 300 nm was measured in a type 53 cuvette (Starna, Atascadero, CA) with a 62ADS spectrophotometer (Aviv, Lakewood, NJ) using a step size of 1 nm. After the spectroscopy the samples were assayed for ability to cause an increase in the OD of a vesicle suspension to verify that the S fragment but not the buffer control caused vesicle fusion. Proton one-dimensional NMR was done with a Bruker AMX 500 MHz spectrometer. Solvent suppression was achieved using a binomial sequence. 200 μl of protein or buffer was mixed with 800 μl of buffer (10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.2, 50 mm KCl, 1% sucrose). This was placed into a Spectra/Por MWCO: 3,500 dialysis membrane (Spectrum, Los Angeles, CA) that was placed into 100 ml of the above buffer with either 50 μCi of45Ca or [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products) and allowed to reach equilibrium at 4 °C for 24 h. Aliquots were removed, scintillation mixture was added, and radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. Egg yolk phosphatidylcholine in chloroform (Sigma) was evaporated under nitrogen and resuspended to 10 mg/ml in buffer (140 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.05 mm NaN3, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.2). To make vesicles, the mixture was sonicated with an Ultrasonics W220 probe sonicator (Ultrasonics, Plainsville, NY) for 20 min on ice. The assay was initiated when 0.5 ml of protein (0.4 mg/ml) or PEG1 (0.5% or 1%) was mixed with 0.25 ml of buffer and 0.25 ml of vesicles. The optical density at 360 nm was measured for 5 min after mixing. Vesicle suspensions were placed on a glass slide, overlaid with a coverslip, and observed with unfiltered tungsten light using a 1.4 NA 60× phase contrast objective on a Nikon Microphot FX microscope. For negative staining, a 200 mesh copper grid with a carbon type B support film (Ted Pella, Redding, CA) was discharged using a Zerostat 3 static discharge gun, and a drop of vesicle suspension was placed on the grid. After 1 min the suspension was wicked off the grid, and a drop of 2% ammonium molybdate (34.MacDonald R.I. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 4058-4066Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) was placed on the grid for 1 min and then wicked off. The grids were allowed to dry and then examined at 80 or 100 kV accelerating voltage in a JEOL JEM-2010 transmission electron microscope (JEOL USA, Inc., Peabody, MA). Images were recorded on Kodak SO-163 electron image film. Vesicle fusion was measured by observing fluorescence energy transfer based on the method of Fung and Stryer (35.Fung B.K. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5241-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). Donor vesicles were prepared by mixing egg yolk phosphatidylcholine (Sigma) with NBD-PE (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) in chloroform to 100 and 20 mg/ml, respectively. The lipids were then evaporated under nitrogen and resuspended in buffer (10 mm MOPS, pH 7.0) to 10 and 2 mg/ml, respectively. Vesicles were formed by incubating the lipids at 50 °C for 30 min followed by probe sonication in an ice/water bath for 3 min. Acceptor vesicles were created in the same manner except that rhodamine DHPE (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used instead of NBD-PE. Buffer or 20 μl of protein (0.4 mg/ml) was incubated with a mixture of 10 μl of each donor and acceptor vesicles for 3 h at room temperature. The samples were then diluted to 1 ml with buffer and excited at 463 nm (excitation maximum of NBD-PE), whereas the fluorescence was scanned from 500 to 600 nm (the emission maxima for NBD-PE and rhodamine DHPE are 534 and 590, respectively). Transfer efficiency E was calculated using E = 1 −F/F o (35.Fung B.K. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5241-5248Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), where F is the donor fluorescence of the sample containing both donor and acceptor vesicles and F o is the fluorescence of a sample containing only donor vesicles. Alternatively, vesicles were prepared with egg yolk l-α-phosphatidylcholine obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). One set of vesicles contained 0.8 mol % each of donor and acceptor fluorescent lipids, whereas a second set of vesicles contained no fluorescent lipids. After mixing the two sets of vesicles in the presence or absence of S fragment or PEG, transfer efficiency was calculated as E = 1 −F/F o where F is the fluorescence of mixed vesicles at 534 nm with 463 nm excitation andF o is the fluorescence in the presence of 0.1% Triton X-100. A standard curve was used to correlate transfer efficiency with the percentage of mixing. The effect of the S fragment of RtoA on small unilamellar vesicle contents mixing was assayed with one set of vesicles containing TbCl3 and another set of vesicles containing dipicolinic acid following Lentzet al. (36.Lentz B.R. Talbot W. Lee J. Zheng L.-X. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2076-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) omitting the resuspension of lipid in cyclohexane, resuspending lipid in buffer to 10 rather than 15 mg/ml, and omitting the ultracentrifugation step. The total final lipid concentration in the reactions was 0.2 mm. Vesicle mixing was monitored by observing the formation of the fluorescent TbCl3/dipicolinic acid complex over the course of 45 min. The reaction was performed in a buffer containing Ca2+ and EDTA, which destroy the fluorescent TbCl3/dipicolinic acid complex. To verify that any increase in fluorescence was due to vesicle contents mixing, detergent was added to release the vesicle contents, and we observed an essentially complete loss of fluorescence. The effect of the S fragment of RtoA on small unilamellar vesicle contents leakage was similarly assayed with vesicles containing a mixture of TbCl3 and dipicolinic acid (36.Lentz B.R. Talbot W. Lee J. Zheng L.-X. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 2076-2083Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). To monitor pinocytosis, 200 μl of cells at a density of 1 × 105 cells/ml in HL5 were placed onto an 8-well coverglass bottom slide (Type 136439, Nunc, Naperville, IL) and allowed to settle for 10 min. The medium was then gently changed to 2 mg/ml RITC-dextran (RD) (Sigma) in HL5 and then after 10 min changed to HL5. In some experiments, cells were then examinedin situ. In other experiments, after 80 min lysosomes were stained by adding Lysosensor Green DND-189 (Molecular Probes) to 1 μm. After 10 min, the medium was changed to either PBM or HL5 for an additional 10 min. Cells were then fixed for 3 min in HL5 containing 1% formaldehyde, after which the medium was changed to HL5. Images were taken with a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope using a 60× 1.4 NA phase/fluorescence objective lens. A Photometrics Imagepoint cooled CCD camera operating at an exposure of 16× and gain of 24 db supplied a video image to an IBM clone computer and a direct monitor. Nuclei were stained with 4′,-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole following the work of Wood et al. (19.Wood S.A. Ammann R.R. Brock D.A. Li L. Spann T.P. Gomer R.H. Dev. 1996; 122: 3677-3685Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Staining of contractile vacuoles with FM4–64 was done following the methods of Heuser et al.(37.Heuser J. Zhu Q.L. Clarke M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1311-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Staining of calmodulin in fixed and permeabilized cells was done following Zhu and Clarke (38.Zhu Q.L. Clarke M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), omitting the agarose overlay step. Mitochondria were stained with MitoTracker Red CM-H2XRos or MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) following the manufacturer's directions. EM grade 25% glutaraldehyde, osmium tetroxide, propylene oxide, Eponate 12 embedding medium, and BEEM capsules were obtained from Ted Pella, Inc. (Redding, CA). Cells grown in HL5 to 2 × 106 cells/ml were pelleted in 15-ml aliquots at 300 × g to yield 0.2 ml of packed cells. Pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of PBM and washed two more times with PBM. Each pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of ice-cold 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBM and held for 2 h on ice. After two 10-min washes in PBM, each pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of 1% osmium tetroxide in water and held 1 h at room temperature. After two 10-min washes in distilled water, each pellet was dehydrated in 10-min steps in 10 ml each of 50, 70, and 95% ethanol, two 10-min steps each in 1–1.5 ml of 100% ethanol, and two 15-min steps in propylene oxide. Dehydration in 100% ethanol and propylene oxide and all subsequent steps were carried out in polypropylene Eppendorf centrifuge tubes with centrifugation at 10,000 × g. Final pellets were resuspended in 50:50 embedding medium:propylene oxide overnight at room temperature. After warming the samples and fresh Eponate 12 to 60 °C, cells were pelleted and resuspended in Eponate 12, formulated for medium hardness. Resuspended cells were distributed into warmed BEEM capsules that were centrifuged for 20 min at 700 ×g. Specimens were cured overnight at 60 °C and sectioned with glass knives on a DuPont/Sorvall MT2-B ultramicrotome. Pale to medium gold sections were picked up on 200 mesh copper grids with carbon type-B substrate (Pella catalog number 01811), and double stained with uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate according to Lewis and Knight (39.Lewis P.R. Knight D.P. Glauert A.M. Cytochemical Staining Methods for Electron Microscopy: Practical Methods in Electron Microscopy. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1992: 54-55Google Scholar) with the exception that washes were done by floating the grid on a drop of water rather than placing it in a stream of water. Sections were examined in the electron microscope as described above. 200 μl of bovine serum albumin/colloidal gold conjugate (5 nm diameter; Ted Pella, Inc.) was de-salted using a Microcon-50 microconcentrator (Amicon, Beverly, MA) and resuspended in 1 ml of PBM. 30 ml each of vegetativertoA and parental cells were pelleted as above, washed once in 15 ml of PBM, and then resuspended in 15 ml PBM with 0.5 ml of desalted gold conjugate suspension. 5 ml of each cell suspension was removed and centrifuged 5 min after adding the colloidal gold, and the pellets were resuspended in ice-cold 2.5% glutaraldehyde and processed for electron microscopy as described above. The remaining suspensions were centrifuged at the same time, pellets were resuspended in HL-5 medium, and the suspensions were incubated in shaking culture without label. Cells were then removed and processed for electron microscopy 20 and 60 min after resuspension in HL-5. Endocytosis was assayed as described by Buczynski et al. (40.Buczynski G. Bush J. Zhang L.Y. Rodriguez-Paris J. Cardelli J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1343-1360Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Fluid phase exocytosis was measured using FITC-dextran (FD) (Sigma) as described previously (41.Bush J. Temesvari L. Rodriguez-Paris J. Buczynski G. Cardelli J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1623-1638Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. Cells grown to 2 × 106 cells/ml were harvested and resuspended in HL5 containing FD at 2 mg/ml. The cells were allowed to internalize FD for 3 h then collected and resuspended in fresh HL5. At the indicated times, 1 ml of cells was collected by centrifugation and washed once in 5 mm glycine-NaOH (pH 8.5) containing 100 mmsucrose. The cells were then lysed in 1 ml of the same buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100. The fluorescence of the lysate was measured in an Aminco Bowman Series 2 Luminescence Spectrometer. Excitation and emission wavelengths for FITC were 495 and 520, respectively. To examine the relationship between cell lineage and endocytic vesicles cells from mid-log phase shaking cultures were diluted to 6 × 103 cells/ml, and 200 μl was placed in the well of an 8-well coverslip bottom chamber slide (Type 136439, Nunc, Naperville, IL). The cells were observed and videotaped as described above using a 4 × 0.13 NA phase objective. After approximately 18 h, under red illumination 20 μl of 20 mg/ml fluorescein isothiocyanate, 70 kDa of dextran (Sigma) in PBM was gently added as described by Klein and Sartre (42.Klein G. Satre M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1986; 138 (1152): 1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). After 10 min, the medium was changed to fresh HL5 with the dual channel peristaltic pump. 60 min after adding the FITC-dextran, the cells were observed with a 60 × 1.4 NA oil immersion phase/fluorescence objective lens with a fluorescein filter cube. Phase and epifluorescence images of the cells were recorded with the camera exposure turned up to 16×. From the appearance of the FITC-dextran fluorescence, cells were scored as having large vacuoles, multiple small vacuoles, or no detectable ingested FITC-dextran. The cells were then fixed and stained for RtoA as described above. To examine contractile vacuoles, a field of cells in HL5 growing in monolayer culture in a coverslip bottom slide was observed with a 10× objective. After identifying dividing cells, the cells were stained with FM4–64 according to Heuser et al. (37.Heuser J. Zhu Q.L. Clarke M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1311-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), and the sister pair was observed with a 60 × 1.4 NA objective, using epifluorescence with a rhodamine filter cube. Following the procedures of Aubryet al. (43.Aubry L. Klein G. Martiel J.L. Satre M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 861-866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), cells at 5 × 106 cells/ml were incubated in 2 mg/ml FITC-dextran in HL5 for 10 min. They were then collected by centrifugation at 4 °C, washed once in ice-cold HL5, resuspended in HL5 to 5 × 107 cells/ml, and mixed. At time points, 134-μl aliquots were removed, centrifuged at 300 × g for 20 s and resuspended in 1 ml of 50 mm MES-NaOH (pH 6.5) containing 10 mm KCl. Cellular fluorescence was determined using emission at 520 nm and excitation at both 450 and 495 nm. The pH of endocytic vesicles was determined by calculating the ratio of the former value to the latter and comparing the results to a standard curve. This curve was constructed using cells bearing ingested probe permeabilized to ions with 0.1% digitonin and suspended in the above buffer adjusted to different pH values with acetic acid or NaOH. 200 μl of 1 × 104 cells/ml in HL5 added to the well of an 8-well slide. The settled cells were then followed by time lapse videomicroscopy using a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope with a 10 × 0.5 NA phase/fluorescence objective lens. A Photometrics Imagepoint cooled CCD camera operating at an exposure of 4× and gain of 21 db supplied a video image to a Panasonic 6740 time lapse video recorder operating in 480-h mode. After approximately 16 h, a dual channel peristaltic pump operating at 75 μl/min was used to gently change the media over the course of 10 min to 20 m (20 mm MES, pH 6.1, with KOH). For a dye stock, 50 μg of BCECF AM (Molecular Probes) was dissolved in 50 μl of anhydrous methyl sulfoxide (Aldrich, Milwaukee, WI"

It has been demonstrated that the expression of Tip in T cells is capable of inducing the DNA binding of members of the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) family of transcription factors. We have examined the mechanism behind which STATs 1 and 3 are activated by Tip expression. Tip becomes tyrosine phosphorylated by p56 lck at two sites in the amino-terminal tail region. One site of phosphorylation lies within a consensus YXPQ binding motif for the SH2 domains of STATs 1 and 3. We demonstrate that tyrosine phosphorylation of Tip at this site is required for the binding of STATs, and the induction of STAT dependent transcription. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, similar to STAT activation by v-Src, the optimum induction of STAT-dependent transcription by Tip requires Ras/Rac mediated signaling events.

Susceptible hosts include most species of new world monkeys, New Zealand White rabbits, and human peripheral blood lymphocytes. Cells transformed by this virus are primarily CD8+CD25+ and manifest CTL activity (1.Medveczky M.M. Geck P. Sullivan J.L. Serbousek D. Djeu J.Y. Medveczky P.G. Virology. 1993; 196: 402-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Two proteins expressed by this virus have been shown to be required for viral transformation, but not for viral replication (2.Chou C.S. Medveczky M.M. Geck P. Vercelli D. Medveczky P.G. Virology. 1995; 208: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar,3.Duboise S.M. Guo J. Czajak S. Desrosiers R.C. Jung J.U. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1308-1313Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both proteins are expressed from a single bi-cistronic message. One protein, termed STP for saimiri transformingprotein, has been suggested to bind and activate cellular p21 ras (4.Jung J.U. Desrosiers R.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6506-6512Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The other protein was termed Tip, fortyrosine kinase interactingprotein. Tip was found to tightly bind p56 lck bothin vitro and in vivo, without any measurable interaction with other Src family members (5.Biesinger B. Tsygankov A.Y. Fickenscher H. Emmrich F. Fleckenstein B. Bolen J.B. Broker B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4729-4734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Subsequent evidence has shown that Tip dramatically increases the tyrosine kinase activity of p56 lck, and this appears to be by inducing a conformational change (6.Lund T. Medveczky M.M. Medveczky P.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 378-382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Hartley D.A. Hurley T.R. Hardwick J.S. Lund T.C. Medveczky P.G. Sefton B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20056-20059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). T lymphocytes express many members of the Src family of protein tyrosine kinases, the most highly expressed of these is p56 lck. The expression pattern of p56 lck is predominantly within T cells, with some expression also occurring in NK and B cells. Regulation of the activity of Src family members has been studied in detail. This regulation involves phosphorylation at two conserved regulatory tyrosines and intramolecular binding (8.Yamaguchi H. Hendrickson W.A. Nature. 1996; 384: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The importance of one of these tyrosines was suggested by the finding that it was mutated in v-Src and important for the transforming activity of v-Src. The analogous mutations have been made in other Src family members, including p56 lck, and have suggested a common mechanism of regulating their activity. This mutation, a tyrosine to phenylalanine change at Tyr-505 in p56 lck, generates a constitutively activated and transforming protein (9.Adler H.T. Sefton B.M. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1191-1199PubMed Google Scholar). Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs)1 are a family of transcription factors that are resident cytoplasmic proteins (10.Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar). Upon activation by tyrosine and serine phosphorylation, they form hetero- and homodimers and migrate to the nucleus to induce transcription. STATs contain a Src homology 2 domain (SH2) which allows their dimerization following tyrosine phosphorylation. The SH2 domain also allows their recruitment to sites of tyrosine phosphorylation on cytokine and growth factor receptors. This recruitment brings the STATs in proximity to activated tyrosine kinases, which can then phosphorylate and activate the STATs themselves. The Janus family of tyrosine kinases (Jaks) typically mediates the activation of STATs by cytokine stimulation. However, there is increasing evidence that other tyrosine kinases can also induce the activation of STATs. Transformation of cells by the v-Src oncoprotein has recently been demonstrated to require the activation of STAT3 dependent transcription (11.Cao X. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 12.Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Besser D. Lathem W.W. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2553-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). It was demonstrated that STAT3 can form a complex with v-Src, and that the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 is mediated by v-Src independent of Jak kinase activation. In addition, it was demonstrated that the activation of STATs by interleukin-3 stimulation requires the activity of c-Src (13.Chaturvedi P. Reddy M.V. Reddy E.P. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1749-1758Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Recently, it was demonstrated that a H. saimiri protein, Tip, can induce the activation of STATs 1 and 3 in a manner requiring another Src family member, p56 lck (14.Lund T.C. Garcia R. Medveczky M.M. Jove R. Medveczky P.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6677-6682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have commenced this work to investigate the manner by which Tip, from strain 484 of H. saimiri, or activated p56 lck are able to induce the transcriptional activity of STATs. We find that Tip is phosphorylated at a tyrosine residue within a YXPQ (Tyr-72) consensus binding site for the SH2 domains of STATs 1 and 3. Phosphorylation of this tyrosine in Tip by p56 lck is required for the tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs 1 and 3, and an induction of STAT-dependent transcription. We further demonstrate that this robust activation of STATs by Tip and p56 lck is sufficient to induce some transcription from the c-Fos promoter through the STAT-binding site, the Sis-inducible element (SIE). A derivative of the human Jurkat T cell leukemia that stably expresses the SV-40 large T antigen, was grown in RPMI supplemented with l-glutamine and 10% fetal calf serum. A similar derivative of the 293 human kidney cell line, 293T, was grown in Dulbecco-Vogt modified Eagle's media also supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Rabbit antisera specific for Tip and p56 lck have been described elsewhere (7.Hartley D.A. Hurley T.R. Hardwick J.S. Lund T.C. Medveczky P.G. Sefton B.M. J. Biol.

Monoclonal antibodies (Transduction Laboratories) and rabbit antisera to STATs 1 and 3 were generous gifts from Dr. Michael David. Wild type Tip was expressed from the pRc/RSV plasmid (Invitrogen) which uses the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat as a promoter. Tyrosine to phenylalanine mutations of Tip were generated using a polymerase chain reaction-based site-directed mutagenesis, and confirmed by sequencing. Wild type murine p56 lck was expressed using the pCEP4 plasmid (Invitrogen). F505 lck was placed in the SRα3 vector, which uses human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat sequences to drive expression. All c-Fos luciferase constructs were a generous gift from Dr. Brent Cochran, and have been described elsewhere (16.Kim D.W. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3310-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). N17 Rac1 was expressed from the pEXV vector and was a gift from Dr. Alan Hall. The N17 Ha-Ras has been described previously (17.Szeberenyi J. Cai H. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5324-5332Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Jurkat cells were transfected using the DMRIE-C lipofection reagent (Life Technologies) under serum-free conditions for 4–5 h. The cells were then overlaid with serum containing media to give a final serum concentration of 1%. Cells were then sampled 24 h post-transfection. For cell stimulation, cells were incubated with a mixture of 60 nm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and 1.5 μm ionomycin (Sigma) for 3 h prior to cell lysis. Inhibitors PD98059 (Sigma) and SB202190 (BioMol) were also added 3 h prior to lysis. Cells were harvested and washed once in cold phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then lysed in 100 μl of lysis buffer (0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.8, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol, and 2 mm EDTA). Cells were incubated in lysis buffer for 15–20 min on ice before pelleting in a microcentrifuge for 2 min at high speed to remove cellular debris. 30 μl of cell lysate was mixed with 100 μl of assay buffer (30 mm Tricine, 3 mm ATP, 15 mmMgSO4, 10 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.8) in a 96-well microtiter plate just prior to measurement. Plates were assayed using the MLX microtiter luminescence detection system (Dynex Technologies) which injects 100 μl of the substrate (1 mmd-luciferin in assay buffer) prior to measuring luminescence. Human 293T cells were transfected by a standard calcium phosphate precipitation method. In general, 293T cell luciferase assays were performed as described for Jurkat cells, although the cells were first scraped into the tissue culture medium (4 ml) before 500 μl of resuspended cells were transferred to a microcentrifuge tube and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Assays for the expression of β-Gal were as follows. 5 μl of cell lysate was mixed with 400 μl of Z Buffer (60 mm Na2HPO4, 40 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm MgSO4, and 40 mm2-mercaptoethanol) and incubated 5 min at room temperature. The samples were then mixed with 100 μl of Z Buffer containing 4 mg/mlo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside and incubated at 37 °C until the color changed to yellow (3–10 min). The reaction was stopped with 500 μl of 1 m sodium carbonate. Data were obtained by measuring the absorbance at 420 nm. Techniques used for cell lysis and immunoprecipitation have been described previously (18.Hartley D. Corvera S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21939-21943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In general, a lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 was used to lyse cells, while immunoprecipitates were washed with the addition of 0.1% SDS. Antibody-antigen complexes were collected using Pansorbin (Calbiochem). In general, immunoprecipitates were resuspended in kinase buffer (40 mmsodium PIPES, pH 7.2, 10 mm MnCl2) at 4 °C (19.Hardwick J.S. Sefton B.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4527-4531Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). For quantitation of Lck, a fraction of the precipitate was used for Western blot analysis. The remainder of the sample was subjected to a protein kinase assay using [Val5]angiotensin II as an exogenous substrate. Western blotting was carried out as described previously (7.Hartley D.A. Hurley T.R. Hardwick J.S. Lund T.C. Medveczky P.G. Sefton B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20056-20059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Filters were blocked by incubation in 3% bovine serum albumin and then stained with rabbit anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies, rabbit anti-p56 lck antibodies, or rabbit anti-Tip antibodies. Bound antibodies were detected with125I-Protein A (ICN) and a PhosphorImager, or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated Protein A (Bio-Rad) and enhanced chemiluminescence. The H. saimiri protein Tip has been demonstrated to induce the DNA binding of STATs 1 and 3 (14.Lund T.C. Garcia R. Medveczky M.M. Jove R. Medveczky P.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 6677-6682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Lund T.C. Prator P.C. Medveczky M.M. Medveczky P.G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This Tip induced DNA binding is dependent on the presence of p56 lck. Given that the DNA binding of different transcription factors does not always correlate with transcriptional activity (21.Sizemore N. Leung S. Stark G.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4798-4805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we commenced our studies by testing the ability of Tip to induce STAT-dependent transcription. T antigen expressing Jurkat T cells were transfected with a construct that uses three copies of the c-Fos SIE to drive transcription of the luciferase gene. Some cells were co-transfected with a construct to express the Tip protein from strain 484 of H. saimiri, or an activated mutant of p56 lck, F505 lck. Treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin was used as a positive control and is commonly used to mimic T cell activation. We find that Tip-mediated signals generate a dramatic induction of STAT-dependent transcription (Fig.1). In contrast, the constitutively activated F505 lck is unable to induce any transcription above the background level. The same construct is able to induce NFAT-dependent transcription and transcription from the interleukin-2 promoter (data not shown and Ref. 22.Luo K. Sefton B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4724-4732Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These results confirm that Tip is able to induce STAT-dependent transcription in T cells. The inability of the activated and transforming p56 lck mutant to induce STAT-dependent transcription suggests that the Tip-induced signal involves more than an increase in p56 lck tyrosine kinase activity. STAT transcription factors are recruited to tyrosine-phosphorylated cell surface receptors by their SH2 domains. Once bound to these activated receptors, the STATs are themselves tyrosine phosphorylated, at which point they disassociate from the receptor and hetero- or homodimerize before moving to the nucleus to induce transcription. It has long been known that Tip is tyrosine phosphorylated by p56 lck, although the sites of phosphorylation have yet to be demonstrated. There are 5 tyrosines in Tip-484, including one within a consensus, YXPQ, binding motif for the SH2 domains of STATs 1 and 3. We proceeded to generate a panel of tyrosine to phenylalanine point mutants of Tip to determine which tyrosine(s) is phosphorylated in Tip, and if these sites affected STAT activation. Tip expressed alone in 293T epithelial kidney cells migrates as a single band of around 30 kDa on SDS-PAGE (Fig.2). In the presence of p56 lck, Tip resolves as three separate bands ranging in size from 30 to 37 kDa. Only the two slower migrating forms of Tip are labeled with phosphate following an in vitro kinase reaction (Fig. 2, and Ref. 6.Lund T. Medveczky M.M. Medveczky P.G. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 378-382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Single mutations of either Tyr-72 or Tyr-85 alters the mobility shift of Tip when expressed with p56 lck. Mutation of both Tyr-72 and Tyr-85 to phenylalanine prevents the ability of p56 lck to incorporate phosphate into Tip and reduces the mobility of Tip to that when expressed alone. Phosphoamino acid analysis was performed usingin vivo labeled Tip and confirms that tyrosines 72 and 85 account for all the phosphate incorporated into tyrosine residues, although there is significant serine phosphorylation even in the absence of p56 lck co-expression (data not shown). Mutation of other tyrosines in Tip has no effect on the in vitrophosphorylation of Tip by p56 lck (data not shown). Previous reports have suggested Tyr-114 in Tip from strain 488 plays a role in the binding of Tip to p56 lck and the resultant regulation of p56 lck activity by Tip (23.Guo J. Duboise M. Lee H. Li M. Choi J.K. Rosenzweig M. Jung J.U. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7092-7096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This tyrosine is analogous to Tyr-72 in Tip-484, as determined by sequence alignment. We can find no interaction of the p56 lck SH2 domain with any Tip construct (data not shown). In addition, we compared the ability of these tyrosine mutants to increase p56 lck activity. Human 293T cells were transfected with p56 lck alone, or co-transfected with different Tip constructs. Following cell lysis, immune complexes were isolated and tested in vitro for p56 lck tyrosine kinase activity against an exogenous substrate. These experiments show no significant difference in the ability of any Tip construct to interact with (Fig. 2), or increase the activity of p56 lck (Fig. 3). The data in Fig. 2 shows that Tyr-72 in Tip is a site of tyrosine phosphorylation by p56 lck. We next looked at whether Tip tyrosine phosphorylation is required for the binding of STATs, and the induction of STAT tyrosine phosphorylation. Human 293T cells were again transfected with p56 lck and Tip constructs alone and together. STAT3 was precipitated from these cells and Western blot analysis was performed to test for the tyrosine phosphorylation status of STAT3. Expression of Tip or p56 lck alone fails to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3 (Fig.4 A). However, when WT Tip or F85 Tip are co-expressed with p56 lck there is an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3. Immunoprecipitates of STAT3 from these cells are also able to co-precipitate Tip and p56 lck. In contrast, co-expression of F72 Tip and p56 lck fails to induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT3, or the inclusion of STAT 3 into a Tip·p56 lck complex. Tyrosine 72 in Tip is also required for STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation by Tip and p56 lck (Fig.4 B). The tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs is required for their ability to induce transcription. Given the observed importance of Tip tyrosine phosphorylation in the binding to and tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs 1 and 3, we next investigated if this correlated with the ability to induce STAT-dependent transcription. As mentioned previously, p56 lck is normally expressed only in lymphoid tissues and therefore 293T cells provides a system to study the effect of Tip in the absence of p56 lck. Human 293T cells were transfected with combinations of Tip and p56 lck constructs. All cells were also co-transfected with the SIE-dependent luciferase reporter and a β-galactosidase expression plasmid. Expression from the β-galactosidase plasmid was used to normalize for differences in transfection efficiency, although no normalization greater than 1.5 was necessary. As with the Tip induced binding and tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs, we find that Tip requires both p56 lck and Tyr-72 to induce STAT-dependent transcription (Fig. 5 A). A similar dependence for Tyr-72 can be observed in T cells (Fig.5 B). The preceding experiments used the SIE from the c-Fos promoter to assay for STAT-dependent transcription. Others have shown that the SIE can play an important role in driving transcription of the c-Fos promoter (16.Kim D.W. Cheriyath V. Roy A.L. Cochran B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3310-3320Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Given the robust activation of STATs by Tip, we wished to test the ability of Tip to induce c-Fos transcription. T antigen expressing Jurkat T cells were transfected with a construct using the full-length c-Fos promoter to drive transcription of a luciferase gene. Some cells were co-transfected with Tip or p56 lck constructs. Expression of Tip is able to induce a 2-fold activation of transcription from the c-Fos (Fig.6). In contrast, expression of the activated F505 lck construct in T cells is not able to induce any significant transcription from the c-Fos promoter. These results correlate with the abilities of Tip and F505 lck to activate STAT-dependent transcription from the SIE within the c-Fos promoter. Consistent with the activation of STATs, we find that the F72 Tip is unable to induce transcription from the full-length c-Fos promoter. In addition, Tip is unable to induce c-Fos transcription when the SIE has been removed. Considerable evidence has demonstrated that for maximum transcriptional activity, STATs need to be serine phosphorylated as well as tyrosine phosphorylated (26.Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar, 27.David M. Petricoin 3rd, E. Benjamin C. Pine R. Weber M.J. Larner A.C. Science. 1995; 269: 1721-1723Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 28.Goh K.C. Haque S.J. Williams B.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5601-5608Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). A known substrate of p56 lck is the hematopoietic specific Rac/Cdc42 exchange factor, p95 Vav (24.Han J. Das B. Wei W. Van Aelst L. Mosteller R.D. Khosravi-Far R. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. Broek D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1346-1353Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). An effector of Rac and Cdc42 is the ubiquitously expressed Ser/Thr kinase Pak1. In T cells, the activation of Pak has been shown to lie upstream of Ras activation following cross-linking of the T cell receptor (25.Yablonski D. Kane L.P. Qian D. Weiss A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5647-5657Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The Src-mediated serine phosphorylation of STAT3 has been reported to involve both Ras/ERK phosphorylation and Rac induced JNK/p38 phosphorylation (29.Turkson J. Bowman T. Adnane J. Zhang Y. Djeu J.Y. Sekharam M. Frank D.A. Holzman L.B. Wu J. Sebti S. Jove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7519-7528Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We proceeded to test whether the Tip induced activation of STATs 1 and 3 in T cells required a similar activation of Ras- and Rac-mediated signaling pathways. The inhibitor, PD98059, selectively blocks the activity of MAP kinases, MEK1/2. Treatment of Tip-transfected cells with 50 μm PD98059 resulted in nearly a 50% reduction in the Tip-induced STAT-dependent transcription (Fig.7). The specific inhibitor of p38, SB202190, has a similar inhibitory effect on the Tip activation of STATs. Consistent with these results we find that co-expression of Tip with dominant negative mutants of Ras or Rac1 has a strong inhibitory effect on the activation of STATs by Tip. These results for Tip induced transcription from the c-Fos SIE are similar to those demonstrated for v-Src-induced STAT3 transcription (29.Turkson J. Bowman T. Adnane J. Zhang Y. Djeu J.Y. Sekharam M. Frank D.A. Holzman L.B. Wu J. Sebti S. Jove R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7519-7528Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). We can also observe an inhibition of the Tip-induced c-Fos transcription by co-expression of dominant negative Ras or Rac1 mutants (data not shown). Our data demonstrate that tyrosine 72 acts as a docking site for the recruitment of STATs 1 and 3 to Tip (Fig. 4). The Jak family of tyrosine kinases typically mediates the activation of STATs following cytokine stimulation (10.Darnell Jr., J.E. Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3401) Google Scholar). For the activation of STATs by Jak kinases to proceed, both the kinase and STATs need to be recruited to activated cytokine receptors. Our data suggest a similar model whereby Tip acts as an activated receptor with sites of tyrosine phosphorylation used to recruit STATs, and other domains used to recruit tyrosine kinases (p56 lck). The lack of p56 lck induced activation of STATs in the absence of Tip suggests that there may be no endogenous adaptor in T cells to allow for p56 lck to activate STATs during normal T cell activation events (30.Lund T.C. Medveczky M.M. Medveczky P.G. Cell Immunol. 1999; 192: 133-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). It is clear from many different reports that Src is able to phosphorylate and activate members of the STAT family of transcription factors (11.Cao X. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar, 12.Bromberg J.F. Horvath C.M. Besser D. Lathem W.W. Darnell Jr., J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2553-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that v-Src will bind STAT3 by co-precipitation experiments (11.Cao X. Tay A. Guy G.R. Tan Y.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1595-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). However, these experiments do not define whether the SH2 or SH3 domains of v-Src are involved, or whether the interaction is direct. Specifically, the authors do not address the potential role of other tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins found in the precipitates to act as docking or linker proteins between v-Src and STAT3. To our knowledge, no experiments performed with v-Src can rule out that a receptor/adaptor mediates the association between Src and STATs. Since there is a high degree of homology between Src family members, we suggest that the interaction between v-Src and STAT3 may involve a docking protein that remains to be defined. Given that STAT3 activation is required for cellular transformation by v-Src, it is possible that the activation of STATs by Tip also plays an important role in the transformation of T cells by H. saimiri. It has been shown that tyrosine phosphorylation of STATs is sufficient to induce DNA binding, but that serine phosphorylation is required for the induction of transcription (26.Wen Z. Zhong Z. Darnell Jr., J.E. Cell. 1995; 82: 241-250Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1755) Google Scholar). Our test for the activation of STATs by Tip was to measure the induction of STAT-dependent transcription by using a luciferase reporter assay. Previous work on the Tip activation of STATs has utilized electrophoretic mobility shift assays to measure the ability of STATs to bind DNA (20.Lund T.C. Prator P.C. Medveczky M.M. Medveczky P.G. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1689-1694Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The dramatic activation of p56 lck by Tip or mutation of the regulatory tyrosine (Tyr-505) leads to the tyrosine phosphorylation of numerous cellular proteins (7.Hartley D.A. Hurley T.R. Hardwick J.S. Lund T.C. Medveczky P.G. Sefton B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20056-20059Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), possibly including STATs 1 and 3 (31.Lund T.C. Coleman C. Horvath E. Sefton B.M. Jove R. Medveczky M.M. Medveczky P.G. Cell Signal. 1999; 11: 789-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). While the results in Fig. 4 suggest that p56 lck is unable to phosphorylate STATs in the absence of Tyr-72 in Tip, we have found a weak induction of STAT tyrosine phosphorylation in the presence of F72 Tip with p56 lck in some experiments. Therefore, it appears that Tip tyrosine phosphorylation both increases the efficiency and specificity of substrate phosphorylation, including STATs 1 and 3. The recruitment of STATs to Tip will also bring the STATs into an efficient signaling complex to provide serine phosphorylation to induce their transcriptional activation. Other research has suggested roles for Tyr-72 other than the recruitment of STATs. In particular, data with the Tip protein from strain 488 of H. saimiri has suggested an involvement of tyrosine 114 in the binding and regulation of p56 lck activity by Tip-488 (23.Guo J. Duboise M. Lee H. Li M. Choi J.K. Rosenzweig M. Jung J.U. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7092-7096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tyr-72 in Tip-484 is analogous to Tyr-114 in Tip-488 as determined by sequence alignment using both Clustal and Jotun Hein methods. The data in Figs. 2 and 3 demonstrate that mutation of Tyr-72 in Tip-484 has no obvious effect on the binding of Tip to p56 lck, or the Tip induced increase in p56 lck activity. The mutations made to Tyr-114 in Tip-488 (Tyr to Ser, or Tyr to Gly) were non-conservative in nature and may explain the differences with our results as to the role of Tyr-72 in Tip. The data presented here suggest a model whereby Tip binds to and activates the tyrosine kinase p56 lck in transformed T cells. Following this, Tip becomes tyrosine phosphorylated at two sites by p56 lck, one of which promotes the binding of STATs 1 and 3. The recruitment of STATs to a phosphorylated tyrosine in Tip allows their subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation by the activated p56 lck. Once tyrosine phosphorylated, the STATs can then dimerize and proceed to the nucleus to induce transcription of target genes. We suggest a similar model would occur during transformation of cells by v-Src. In this model, v-Src binds to and phosphorylates an adaptor protein which creates a binding site for the recruitment of STATs. Upon recruitment of STATs to the adaptor protein, v-Src will then phosphorylate and activate the STATs directly, leading to gene transcription. We thank Dr. Bartholomew M. Sefton for continued support, advice, and critical reading of this manuscript and in whose laboratory this work was begun."

In addition to the peptidase domain, the enzyme contains a β-propeller, which excludes large peptides from the active site. The enzyme is inhibited with thiol reagents, possibly by reacting with Cys-255 located close to the substrate binding site.

In contrast to the wild type enzyme, the Cys-255 → Thr variant was not inhibited withN-ethylmaleimide, indicating that Cys-255, of the 16 free cysteine residues, exclusively accounts for the enzyme inhibition. Unlike the wild type enzyme that showed a doubly bell-shaped pH rate profile, the modified enzyme displayed a single bell-shaped pH dependence with benzyloxycarbonyl-Gly-Pro-naphthylamide.

Life Sci. 1993; 52: 1461-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Prolyl oligopeptidase is encountered in a variety of organs and species (3.Polgár L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). These enzymes, however, differ in their reactivities toward thiol reagents. Thus, p-chloromercuribenzoate prevents catalysis by the porcine enzyme almost completely and instantaneously;N-ethylmaleimide causes about 85% inhibition; and the small iodoacetamide inhibits the activity only 45–50% (14.Polgár L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, prolyl oligopeptidases isolated from Flavobacterium meningosepticum(15.Yoshimoto T. Kanatani A. Shimoda T. Inaoka T. Kobubo T. Tsuru D. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1991; 110: 873-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 16.Chevalier S. Goeltz P. Thibault P. Banville D. Gagnon J. J. Biol.

(Tokyo). 1988; 104: 622-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) are not inhibited with thiol reagents. We have recently determined the three-dimensional structure of prolyl oligopeptidase (18.Fülöp V. Böcskei Z. Polgár L. Cell. 1998; 94: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The enzyme is composed of two different domains of equal size, one mainly consisting of the C-terminal moiety is a serine peptidase of α/β-hydrolase fold, and the other is a seven-bladed β-propeller structure not closed by a “velcro” (see Ref. 18.Fülöp V. Böcskei Z. Polgár L. Cell. 1998; 94: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar for explanation). Thanks to this unique feature of the propeller, an opening between the first and last blades may ensure an access to the active site for oligopeptides but not for proteins encountered in the cytosol. The catalytic triad (Ser-554, Asp-641, and His-680), located between the two domains at the base of the large cavity of the propeller domain, displays a different handedness compared with that of the triad of chymotrypsin or subtilisin. Several differences have been observed between the extensively studied serine peptidases and prolyl oligopeptidase. The former enzymes exhibit a simple pH rate profile, controlled by the catalytic imidazole group with a pK a of 7 as found with subtilisin, whereas the enzymes of the trypsin family have an additional group with a pK a of 9–10, which is associated with conformational changes (19.Bender M.L. Kézdy F.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1965; 34: 49-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 20.Polgár L. Mechanisms of Protease Action. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1989: 87-122Google Scholar). Also, these enzymes are only slightly, if at all, affected by ionic strength of the medium. In contrast, prolyl oligopeptidase catalysis conforms to a doubly sigmoid pH rate curve and is rather sensitive to ionic strength (3.Polgár L. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 188-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 14.Polgár L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 197: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The doubly sigmoid pH rate profile indicates the existence of two pH-dependent enzyme forms, one being predominant at pH 6 and the other at pH 8. Perusal of the active site region has suggested that Cys-255, which is located close to the S1 and S3 binding subsites, can account for inhibition of the enzyme with bulky thiol-specific reagents. Prolyl oligopeptidase isolated from F. meningosepticum, which is not inhibited with thiol-reacting agents, has a threonine residue in place of Cys-255. Because the implication of other cysteines in inactivating prolyl oligopeptidase cannot be excluded, in particular those located in the N-terminal region (21.Scaloni A. Barra D. Jones W.M. Manning J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15076-15084Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in this work the role of Cys-255 is tested by substituting threonine, serine, and alanine for Cys-255. It is expected that kinetic investigations with the enzyme variants will explain as to what extent this residue is responsible for the inactivation of prolyl oligopeptidase by thiol reagents, and, more importantly, whether a thiol group from an attached noncatalytic domain could affect the catalytic activity. Prolyl oligopeptidase of porcine brain was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (22.Szeltner Z. Renner V. Polgár L. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The enzyme does not have any post-translational modification, so its expression in E. coli is warranted. In the absence of disulfide bonds, the enzyme is readily folded and produced in a large quantity. Because of the simpler and faster preparation protocol used with the bacterial starting material, which is rather rich in prolyl oligopeptidase, the specific activity of the recombinant enzyme is even higher than the activity obtained directly from pig (22.Szeltner Z. Renner V. Polgár L. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The porcine brain enzyme harbored in plasmid pTrc/PPO (22.Szeltner Z. Renner V. Polgár L. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was used for site-specific mutagenesis. The Cys-255 → Thr mutation was achieved in two steps using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)1 technique. For introduction of the Cys-255 → Thr mutation, the following primer pair was synthesized: Sense primer: 5′-GGGAGGGCacgGAtCCAGTGAACC-3′, BamHI; antisense: 3′-CCCTCCCGtgcCTaGGTCACTTGG-5′. For the 5′ terminus of the gene containing a Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence, primer SD with an EcoRI restriction site was used, whereas the primer designed for the 3′ terminus contained a stop codon and a KpnI restriction site: Primer SD: 5′-GCAGGAATTCTAAGGAGGAATT-3′,EcoRI, Shine-Dalgarno; 3′-primer: 5′-CGGGGTACCGTTACGGAATCCAGTCGATGTTCAG-3′; KpnI, stop. In the first step of PCR, two independent reactions were carried out, using the Vent polymerase, the pTrc/PPO plasmid template digested with the KpnI enzyme, and (i) the SD primer and the antisense primer and (ii) the 3′-primer and sense primer, each run in 25 cycles. The reaction mixture (100 μl) contained 300 μm of each component of dNTP, 0.5 μg of the primers, and 1 μl of 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin in the standard 1× ThermoPol polymerase buffer. The denaturing, annealing, and polymerization temperatures were 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min (with the shorter 5′ product) or 2 min (with the longer 3′ product), respectively. The mutated gene was then obtained in two pieces, which were isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified with a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). In the second step the mixture of the two portions of the gene were used as templates. The reaction mixture was heated to 95 °C, prior to addition of the Vent polymerase. The temperature was then lowered to 50 °C when the complementing ends of the two DNA portions formed double stranded DNA. Heating at 72 °C for 5 min resulted in the synthesis of the strands. The complete strands were able to bind the terminal primers (SD primer and 3′-primer), which were added to the mixture at 95 °C. The amplification was then carried out in 29 cycles at 95, 55, and 72 °C for 1, 1, and 3 min, respectively. The PCR product was identified on an agarose gel (1%) and purified with the QIAquick gel extraction kit. The pure product was digested with EcoRI and KpnI restriction enzymes, isolated with agarose gel electrophoresis, purified with the gel extraction kit, and cloned into theEcoRI and KpnI sites of vector pTrc 99A. The resulting mixture was transformed into E. coli DH5α. Some transformant colonies were grown on LB, to A 600= 0.6, then induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After overnight incubation, the cells were harvested by centrifugation, sonicated, and centrifuged, and the supernatant was assayed for prolyl oligopeptidase activity with the standard substrate, Z-Gly-Pro-Nap. Plasmids were isolated from the active clones, and the purified DNA was digested with BamHI restriction endonuclease. Mutant clones had a distinct digestion pattern, because we introduced an extra restriction site into the gene using the mutant oligonucleotides. Cys-255 → Ser and Cys-255 → Ala variants were prepared according to the same protocol as described for the Cys-255 → Thr derivative of prolyl oligopeptidase, except that the following primers were used: Cys-255 → Ser—sense primer: 5′-AGGGAGGGaTcCGACCCAGT-3′,BamHI; antisense: 3′-TCCCTCCCtAgGCTGGGTCA-5′. Cys-255 → Ala—sense primer: 5′-AGGGAGGGCgcgGAtCCAGT-3′BamHI; antisense: 3′-TCCCTCCCGcgcCTaGGTCA-5′. Large scale production of the Cys-255 → Thr, Cys-255 → Ala, and Cys-255 → Ser variants of prolyl oligopeptidase was achieved inE. coli JM 105 and purified as described for the wild type enzyme (22.Szeltner Z. Renner V. Polgár L. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The reaction of prolyl oligopeptidase with Z-Gly-Pro-Nap (Bachem Ltd., Bubendorf, Switzerland) was measured fluorometrically, using a Jasco FP 777 spectrofluorometer equipped with a thermostated cell holder. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 340 nm (1.5-nm bandwidth) and 410 nm (5-nm bandwidth), respectively. The gain of the photomultiplier was set to “medium.” Cells with excitation and emission path lengths of 1.0 and 0.4 cm, respectively, were used. The substrate with internally quenched fluorescence, Abz-Ser-Pro-Phe(NO2)-Ala-OH, was prepared with solid-phase synthesis, and its hydrolysis was followed in the same way as Z-Gly-Pro-Nap, except that the excitation and emission wavelengths were 337 and 420 nm, respectively. Pseudo-first-order rate constants were measured at substrate concentrations lower than K m and were calculated by nonlinear regression data analysis, using the GraFit software (23.Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit, Version 2. Erythacus Software Ltd., Staines, UK1990Google Scholar). The specificity rate constants (k cat/K m) were obtained by dividing the first-order rate constant by the total enzyme concentration present in the reaction mixture. The Michaelis-Menten parameters, k cat andK m, were determined with initial rate measurements, using substrate concentrations in the range of 0.2–5K m. Because of the poor solubility of Z-Gly-Pro-Nap, in particular in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl, the reactions were carried out in the presence of 0.3% acetonitrile, which caused about 20% inhibition of prolyl oligopeptidase. The kinetic parameters were calculated with nonlinear regression analysis. Theoretical curves for bell-shaped pH rate profiles were calculated using nonlinear regression analysis, using Eq. 1 and the GraFit software (23.Leatherbarrow R.J. GraFit, Version 2. Erythacus Software Ltd., Staines, UK1990Google Scholar). In Eq. 1, kcat/K m(limit) stands for the pH-independent maximum rate constant andK 1 and K 2 are the dissociation constants of a catalytically competent base and acid, respectively. When an additional ionizing group modifies the bell-shaped character of the pH dependence curve, the data were fitted to Eq. 2 (double bell-shaped) or Eq. 3 (sigmoid + bell-shaped) or Eq. 4(bell-shaped curve with double dissociation at the acidic limb), where the limiting values stand for the pH-independent maximum rate constants for the two active forms of the enzyme and K 1,K 2, and K 3 are the dissociation constants of three enzymatic groups whose state of ionization controls the rate constants.kcat/Km=kcat/Km(limit)[1/(1+10pK1−pH+10pH−pK2)]Equation 1 kcat/Km=kcat/Km(limit) 1[1/(1+10pK1−pH−10pH−pK2)]Equation 2 +kcat/Km(limit) 2[1/(1+10pK2−pH+10pH−pK3)]kcat/Km=kcat/Km(limit) 1[1/(1+10pH−pK1)]Equation 3 +kcat/Km(limit) 2[1/(1+10pK2−pH+10pH−pK3)]kcat/Km=kcat/Km(limit)[1/(1+10pK1−pHEquation 4 +10pK1+pKx−2pH+10pH−pK2)] Inhibition of prolyl oligopeptidase withN-ethylmaleimide was measured with 0.14–0.28 μm enzyme and 1.7–6.9 μm N-ethylmaleimide in 1.0 ml of reaction mixture containing 25 mm acetic acid, 25 mm Mes, 25 mmglycine, 75 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA at pH 8.0. Aliquots of 20–40 μl were withdrawn at appropriate times, and the initial rates of the remaining activity were determined with Z-Gly-Pro-Nap (3.4 μm, 0.3% acetonitrile) The K i values, the dissociation constants of the enzyme-inhibitor complex, were calculated from Eq. 5 using at least 10 inhibitor concentrations.ki/k0=1/(1+I/Ki)Equation 5 where k i and k 0are pseudo-first-order rate constants determined at substrate concentrations at least 10-fold less than K m in the presence and absence of inhibitor (I), respectively. As shown in Fig.1, N-ethylmaleimide inhibits 85% of the activity of the wild type enzyme rather rapidly, whereas the activity of the Cys-255 → Thr variant is entirely retained. The enzyme variant is fully active even at 90 min (not shown). Prolyl oligopeptidase possesses 16 cysteine residues, none of which are involved in disulfide bond formation. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of N-ethylmaleimide exclusively originates from blocking Cys-255, and the reactions of other cysteines may only exert a marginal effect, if at all, on the enzyme activity. Substitution of threonine for Cys-255 of prolyl oligopeptidase has resulted in a dramatic change in the pH rate profile. Fig. 2 a illustrates that the wild type enzyme displays a doubly bell-shaped curve, corresponding to two pH-dependent enzyme forms, the high pH form being more active. In contrast, the high pH form of the Cys-255 → Thr variant is essentially inactive; the activity is restricted to the low pH form. One reason for the loss of activity might be a steric hindrance and/or the less polar environment created by the extra methyl group at the substrate binding site. Therefore, we have examined two other variants, each with a smaller side chain and different polarity, namely Cys-255 → Ala and Cys-255 → Ser. At low ionic strength both variants gave single bell-shaped pH dependence curves as found with the Cys-255 → Thr variant (Fig. 2 a and TableI). This ruled out the implication that the methyl group abolished the activity of the high pH form.Table IKinetic parameters for reactions with Z-Gly-Pro-NapEnzymek(limit)1k(limit)2pK 1pK 2pK 3μm −1 s −1μm −1 s −1Wild type1.75 ± 0.205.07 ± 0.224.88 ± 0.317.47 ± 0.139.16 ± 0.06Wild type + NaCl5.09 ± 0.2412.82 ± 0.695.20 ± 0.107.74 ± 0.118.73 ± 0.06Cys-255 → Thr2.00 ± 0.035.00 ± 0.068.27 ± 0.03Cys-255 → Thr + NaCl5.21 ± 0.402.48 ± 0.525.77 ± 0.107.11 ± 0.328.79 ± 0.21Cys-255 → Ser0.74 ± 0.104.90 ± 0.058.95 ± 0.04Cys-255 → Ser + NaCl2.07 ± 0.065.72 ± 0.058.59 ± 0.06Cys-255 → Ala1.65 ± 0.035.16 ± 0.058.48 ± 0.04Cys-255 → Ala + NaCl4.67 ± 0.152.72 ± 0.305.38 ± 0.067.43 ± 0.229.06 ± 0.11 Open table in a new tab It would be interesting to compare the results obtained with the Cys-255 → Thr variant to those of the native prolyl oligopeptidase from F. meningosepticum, which also has a threonine in place of Cys-255. Unfortunately, a detailed kinetic investigation has not yet been performed with this enzyme. However, it has been reported that the pH optimum of the enzyme from F. meningosepticum is 6.5 with a peptide substrate (24.Krieg F. Wolf N. Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 1995; 42: 844-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). This suggests that the pH rate profile for the bacterial enzyme is similar to that observed here for the Cys-255 → Thr variant. There are not any or a very few thiol groups in bacterial proteins. Thus, the F. meningosepticum enzyme contains 2 compared with the 16 cysteines of the mammalian prolyl oligopeptidase. The physiological significance of generation of Cys-255 during evolution is demonstrated by the improved catalytic efficacy. The effects of 0.5 m NaCl on the pH rate profiles has also been investigated (Fig. 2 b and Table I). Under these conditions, the two enzyme forms are preserved with the wild type peptidase (not shown in Fig. 2 b to avoid compressing the other curve), while the rate constants significantly increased (TableI). With the Cys-255 → Thr and Cys-255 → Ala variants, the activity of the high pH form of the enzyme considerably decreased with respect to the low pH form but did not disappear, whereas with the Cys-255 → Ser variant a simple bell-shaped curve was obtained within the experimental error. In Table I are shown the kinetic parameters extracted from the pH dependence curves. It is apparent that pK 1 is rather low, about 5 in the absence of 0.5m NaCl, and somewhat higher in the presence of salt. Because only the basic form of the catalytically competent histidine is active, this residue should have a pK a lower than that (∼7) found with most serine peptidases. This may be due to the effect of positive charges, such as the nearby guanidinium ion of Arg-643 (18.Fülöp V. Böcskei Z. Polgár L. Cell. 1998; 94: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), which can destabilize the protonated histidine. As can be expected, electrostatic shielding by high ionic strength reduces this effect, leading to an enhanced pK 1 value. It is worth noting that in the presence of salt the points at the acidic limb of the pH dependence curve do not precisely fit the theoretical curve. This suggests that at least one additional ionizing group affects the catalysis possibly by causing conformational changes in the protein structure. We feel bound to emphasize that the pK 1 of ∼5 may not be the group constant of His-680. It is very likely an apparent molecular constant, which may arise from the increased activity of the protonated enzyme conformation. The pK 2 may also be generated as a consequence of the enhanced activity at low pH, and its value is dependent upon the relative activities of the two enzyme forms, so that it may not be assigned to a definite functional group. The pK 3 is less affected in this way. It is very likely associated with the instability of the protein at high pH. It has previously been shown that the stability of the enzyme decreases around pH 9 as demonstrated by urea denaturation and inactivation at high temperature (25.Polgár L. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Importantly, the protein tends to denature at somewhat less alkaline pH in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl, which is consistent with the lower pK 3 for the wild type enzyme at higher ionic strength (Table I). The pK 2 and pK 3 values are not far from the pK a of a normal thiol group (∼8.5), and, in a particular protein environment, Cys-255 may adopt either value. Hence, it is possible that the ionization of Cys-255 can contribute to these pK a values. It is known that the reactivity of thiol group depends on its ionization state, where the nondissociated form is virtually inactive. Therefore, we have measured the pH dependence of the rate constants for the reaction of Cys-255 with N-ethylmaleimide in the range of pH 8.0–9.3 (Fig.3). Denaturation at higher pH ruled out a correct determination of the rate constants. A pK aof 9.77 ± 0.03 was extracted from the curve. Although this is an extrapolated value, its error is surprisingly small, and this clearly excludes that pK 2 would depend on the ionization of the thiol group of Cys-255. Moreover, it is unlikely that ionization of the thiol group would significantly contribute to a pK 3 of ∼9. The rather high pK a value of this thiol group is conceivable in light of its immediate environment, which includes the side chains of Phe-476 and Trp-595 at an approximate van der Waals distance from the sulfur atom (18.Fülöp V. Böcskei Z. Polgár L. Cell. 1998; 94: 161-170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Indeed, the less polar environment is not favorable for the formation of a thiolate ion, and thus the ionization occurs with an enhanced pK a value. At or near the active site there are many charged groups, like Arg-643, which participates in substrate binding; Asp-149, which forms a salt bridge with that Arg residue; and Asp-642, Arg-128, and Lys-172, the further constituents of the extended hydrogen bond network. In such a system, the pK a of individual groups cannot be predicted, but alteration in their interactions may elicit a conformational change that is characterized by pK 2. Structural differences between the two pH-dependent forms have also been detected by intrinsic fluorescence measurements, which clearly indicated that the low pH form is more unfolded (25.Polgár L. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 267-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, it appears that the contribution of the nondissociated thiol group of Cys-255 is only essential for the formation of the high pH form of prolyl oligopeptidase. Its absence does not significantly affect the activity of the low pH form (Fig.2 a). To further investigate the distinct effects of Cys-255 on the two active forms of prolyl oligopeptidase, we have also used a fluorogenic tetrapeptide substrate, Abz-Ser-Pro-Phe(NO2)-Ala-OH, which is cleaved between the Pro-Phe(NO2) bond. The existence of the two pH-dependent active forms of the wild type enzyme is even more expressively illustrated in this case (Fig.4 a) than with Z-Gly-Pro-Nap. Specifically, the pH rate profile exhibits a minimum between the two forms in the absence of 0.5 m NaCl, rather than a shoulder found with the classic substrate. The acidic limb of the pH dependence curve could not be detected, because the enzyme tends to be denatured at low pH. If the rate increase with lowering pH stems from an ionization event, the shielding of the electrostatic effects at enhanced ionic strength should modify the pH rate profile. Indeed, the pH rate profile has remarkably changed at low pH in the presence of 0.5m NaCl so that an approximately bell-shaped curve is obtained (Fig. 4 a). The acidic limb of the curve, however, is steeper than expected for a single dissociation (broken line) and even for a double dissociation (solid line). It is noteworthy that the salt effect is quite different for the reactions of the classic and the tetrapeptide substrates. In the case of Z-Gly-Pro-Nap the rate constants increase 2.5- to 3.0-fold (TableI), whereas the alteration with Abz-Ser-Pro-Phe(NO2)-Ala-OH is rather small (Fig. 4 a and TableII). A moderate rate enhancement is only found for the low pH enzyme form.Table IIKinetic parameters for reactions with Abz-Ser-Pro-Phe(NO2)-Ala-OHEnzymek(limit)1k(limit)2pK 1pK 2pK 3μm −1 s −1μm −1 s −1Wild type1.06 ± 0.071.50 ± 0.066.20 ± 0.166.67 ± 0.118.64 ± 0.06Wild type + NaClaConforms to a simple bell-shaped curve.1.41 ± 0.055.70 ± 0.058.85 ± 0.07Cys-255 → Thr0.87 ± 0.030.17 ± 0.045.09 ± 0.076.89 ± 0.108.58 ± 0.32Cys-255 → Thr + NaCl0.64 ± 0.030.20 ± 0.025.77 ± 0.067.01 ± 0.118.91 ± 0.10a Conforms to a simple bell-shaped curve. Open table in a new tab In the reaction of Cys-255 → Thr variant with the tetrapeptide, the activity of the high pH form is very much reduced (Fig. 4 band Table II), as observed with Z-Gly-Pro-Nap (Fig. 2 a). The pH rate profiles exhibit doubly bell-shaped characters, independent of the ionic strength (Fig. 4 b), but the activity of the low pH form is diminished in the presence of 0.5 m NaCl, which is opposite to that found with the Z-Gly-Pro-Nap substrate. The distinct kinds of behavior of the two substrates suggest that the relative activities of the low and high pH forms are different with the different substrates. From the above results the question emerges as to why the activity of the Cys-255 → Thr variant decreases so dramatically above neutrality. The weaker binding is a reasonable possibility that can be tested by measuring the changes in K m. Although K m is not necessarily a binding constant, it is clearly dependent upon binding, being K m =K s k 3/(k 2+ k 3), where k 2 andk 3 are the first-order acylation and deacylation rate constants, respectively. It is seen in TableIII that K mconsiderably increases with the Cys-255 → Thr variant at pH 8.0 but only moderately changes at pH 6.0. The increase inK m may, at least in part, be the consequence of impaired binding to the Cys-255 → Thr variant. The poor solubility of Z-Gly-Pro-Nap precluded the precise determination ofK m for the reaction with the Cys-255 → Thr variant. It was, however, absolutely clear that, in contrast to pH 6, at pH 8 the K m was much higher for the variant than for the wild type enzyme (not shown in Table III).Table IIIMichaelis and inhibition constants for prolyl oligopeptidase and its variantWild typeCys-255 → ThrpH 6.0pH 8.0pH 6.0pH 8.0Abz-Ser-Pro-Phe(NO2)-Ala-OH k cat(s−1)5.45 ± 0.338.95 ± 0.319.87 ± 0.436.49 ± 0.30 K m (μm)8.26 ± 1.026.56 ± 0.6216.0 ± 1.6531.6 ± 2.4 k cat/K m(μm−1s−1)0.6631.3650.6170.212Abz-Ser-d-Pro-Phe(NO2)-Ala-OH K i(μm)15.3 ± 1.644.2 ± 1.447.9 ± 2.7135.8 ± 4.9Z-Gly-Pro-OH K i (μm)10.7 ± 0.4265 ± 1937.5 ± 2.02200 ± 100 Open table in a new tab The above reasoning is strongly supported by measuring true binding constants with peptide inhibitors. One such inhibitor is derived from the tetrapeptide substrate by substituting a d-Pro for Pro at the P1 subsite. The K i values, i.e.the dissociation constants of the enzyme-inhibitor complexes shown in Table III, indicate that the binding of inhibitor at pH 8.0, similarly to that of the substrates, is stronger to the wild type enzyme than to its Cys-255 → Thr variant. The effect is similar with the product-like inhibitor, Z-Gly-Pro-OH (Fig.5 and Table III), except that the difference in K i is more substantial at pH 8.0. The changes in K i may explain why the high pH form of the Cys-255 variant displays lowerk cat/K m than the low pH form. It is unexpected that elimination of the thiol group, although it does not interact with the substrate, still weakens its binding. Hence, the sulfur atom may stabilize the binding site conformation by interacting with nonpolar side chains of its environment. It is noteworthy that theK i value for the peptide containing thed-Pro residue is approximately independent of pH in the case of the wild type enzyme. In contrast, Z-Gly-Pro-OH binds much stronger at pH 6 than at pH 8. Apparently, the carboxylate ion of the P1 proline residue interacts with His-680, and this interaction exhibits greater strength at pH 6, where the imidazole is more extensively protonated than at pH 8. This is supported by the earlier finding that streptogrisin A, a serine peptidase structurally related to chymotrypsin, forms complexes with Ac-Pro-Ala-Pro-Phe-OH and Ac-Pro-Ala-Pro-Tyr-OH, in which the carboxylate ion is bonded to the catalytic histidine but only at low pH (26.James M.N.G. Sielecki A.R. Brayer G.D. Delbaere L.T.J. Brauer C.-A. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 144: 43-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Cys-255 belongs to the fourth blade of the seven-bladed β-propeller domain that regulates the flow of substrates to the active site. This work has provided evidence that, in addition to the filtering effect, the evolutionarily independent propeller domain also offers residues that significantly contribute to the catalytic action of the peptidase domain.

Houston M.A. Augenlicht L.H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3288-3294PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Janson W. Brandner G. Siegel J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1395-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Sodium butyrate exerts most of its biological effects through a reversible inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDAC),1 resulting in histone hyperacetylation and in selective changes in gene expression. Effects similar to those of sodium butyrate are also induced by structurally unrelated inhibitors of HDAC such as trichostatin A (3.Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The acetylation state of core histones plays a critical role in the regulation of transcription. In addition, a DNA butyrate-response element conferring the ability of sodium butyrate to induce gene expression has been identified (4.Yeivin A. Tang D-C. Taylor M.W. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 116: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 5.Gill R.K. Christakos S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2984-2988Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, sodium butyrate also inhibits the expression of several genes including c-myc (6.Heruth D.P. Zirnstein G.W. Bradley J.F. Rothberg P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20466-20472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cyclin D1 (7.Lallemand F. Courilleau D. Sabbah M. Redeuilh G. Mester J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). p21WAF1, a cellular inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase and of the progression in G1 phase of the cell cycle, is induced by sodium butyrate as well as by trichostatin A (8.Steinman R.A. Hoffman B. Iro A. Guillouf C. Liebermann D.A. El-Houseini M.E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3389-3396PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Archer S.Y. Meng S. Shei A. Hodin R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6791-6796Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that in the mouse fibroblast cell line BP-A31 sodium butyrate inhibits the hyperphosphorylation of the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein via a transcription-dependent mechanism (10.Buquet-Fagot C. Lallemand F. Charollais R-H. Mester J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, sodium butyrate induces only a small increase in the level of p21WAF1 transcript in this cell line, suggesting that other butyrate-induced gene products may be involved in its antiproliferative action.Van Lint et al. (11.Van Lint C. Emiliani S. Verdin E. Gene Expr. 1996; 5: 245-253PubMed Google Scholar) showed that only a small subset of gene promoters is sensitive to inhibition of histone deacetylation by trichostatin A. Thus, cloning of transcripts induced by inhibitors of HDAC may facilitate the identification of effectors responsible for the antiproliferative and/or differentiating actions of this class of drugs. Using the differential display technique (12.Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4688) Google Scholar), we cloned the cDNA of a new gene transcript induced by sodium butyrate in the mouse fibroblast cell line BP-A31. The protein encoded by this transcript (designated B-ind1 for butyrate-induced 1) does not affect cell proliferation and apoptosis but does appear to participate in the control of the transcriptional activity of NF-κB that is stimulated by sodium butyrate. In this context, we show that B-ind1 acts downstream of the small GTPase Rac1 in the biochemical pathway leading to NF-κB activation. B-ind1 also collaborates with the activated form of Rac1 to induce c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity. Taken together, these data implicate B-ind1 as a novel component of the sodium butyrate and Rac1-signaling pathways that influence the regulation of gene expression.DISCUSSIONThere is strong evidence that the biological effects of HDAC inhibitors are mediated through their ability to directly induce or inhibit the expression of several genes. Our purpose was to search for such genes and study the cellular functions of the corresponding products. Analyzing the differential display PCR patterns obtained with 12 primer combinations, we found two transcripts whose induction by sodium butyrate in the mouse fibroblast cell line BP-A31 was confirmed by Northern blotting. One of these transcripts, B-ind1, was present in quiescent, nontreated cells and was induced by butyrate in a protein synthesis-independent manner. Analysis of the complete cDNA obtained by screening of a human brain cDNA library revealed an open reading frame coding for a protein of 370 amino acids.One important finding of our study is the demonstration that hB-ind1 is involved in the signaling pathway mediated by the small GTPase Rac1. In particular, hB-ind1 potentiated the Rac1-induced transcription and JNK activation. Moreover, the median region comprising amino acids 101–277 acted as a dominant-negative variant to inhibit the induction of the NF-κB-dependent promoter by Rac1. The mechanism of action of hB-ind1 may rely on the formation of complexes between Rac1 and its targets. Although the sequence of hB-ind1 reveals no Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding site, a distinctive domain contained in several previously identified Rac1 targets (25.Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), the existence of protein complexes containing Rac1 and hB-ind1 was evidenced by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Because other proteins without the Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding site associate with Rac1 (26.Tapon N. Nagata K-I. Lamarche N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), it is possible that hB-ind1 favors the maintenance of Rac1 complexes with its effector systems. This hypothesis is substantiated by the inhibition of the Rac signaling pathway by the median fragment M of hB-ind1, although this fragment did not form stable complexes with Rac1. The M fragment may act as a dominant-negative variant by competing with endogenous wild-type B-ind1 to sequester downstream targets required in Rac1 signaling.In addition, the hB-ind1 protein displays homologies with p23 and related proteins from other species including chicken, yeast, andC. elegans. This suggests that hB-ind1 may be a member of a large family of proteins. Human p23 was first identified as a protein associated with the progesterone receptor (18.Smith D.F. Faber L.E. Toft D.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3996-4003Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was later shown to be in fact a heat shock (Hsp90)-binding protein (27.Johnson J.L. Beito T.G. Krco C.J. Toft D.O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1956-1963Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 28.Sullivan W. Stensgard B. Caucutt G. Bartha B. McMahon N. Alnemri E.S. Litwack G. Toft D.O. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 18: 3727-3734Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) appear to act as Hsp90 cochaperones, but each possesses a chaperone activity of its own (30.Bose S. Weikl T. Bügl H. Buchner J. Science. 1996; 274: 1715-1720Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). p23 has been postulated to crystallize as a homodimer. 2D. Toft, personal communication. These observations lead us to speculate that hB-ind1 may form homodimers with a chaperone type activity toward Rac1. In that case, the dominant-negative action of the M fragment would result from the formation of M/wild-type B-ind1 dimers, depleting Rac1 of its chaperone.The role of B-ind1 in the cellular effects of sodium butyrate is not clear. The B-ind1 transcript was present in all tissues examined; its induction by sodium butyrate in cultured cells is not an universal process, and its overexpression in transfected COS-7 cells did not induce cell growth arrest or apoptosis. In the transformed mouse embryo fibroblasts, the cell in which this transcript has been cloned, B-ind1 may participate in the initial differentiation program.In conclusion, the strategy of cloning transcripts induced by HDAC inhibitors has enabled us to identify a novel protein that is conserved over a wide range of eukaryotic organisms with tissue-specific expression related to specific functions of differentiated cells. The participation of this protein in signaling by the small GTPase Rac1 is an important although perhaps not unique aspect of its activity; B-ind1 and related proteins may have other cellular functions that remain to be discovered. Sodium butyrate is a multifunctional agent known as an efficient inhibitor of cell proliferation, an inducer of differentiation in numerous cell lines and apoptosis in certain cell types (1.Heerdt B.G. Houston M.A. Augenlicht L.H. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 3288-3294PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Janson W. Brandner G. Siegel J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1395-1406Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Sodium butyrate exerts most of its biological effects through a reversible inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDAC),1 resulting in histone hyperacetylation and in selective changes in gene expression. Effects similar to those of sodium butyrate are also induced by structurally unrelated inhibitors of HDAC such as trichostatin A (3.Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The acetylation state of core histones plays a critical role in the regulation of transcription. In addition, a DNA butyrate-response element conferring the ability of sodium butyrate to induce gene expression has been identified (4.Yeivin A. Tang D-C. Taylor M.W. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 116: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 5.Gill R.K. Christakos S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2984-2988Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). However, sodium butyrate also inhibits the expression of several genes including c-myc (6.Heruth D.P. Zirnstein G.W. Bradley J.F. Rothberg P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20466-20472Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and cyclin D1 (7.Lallemand F. Courilleau D. Sabbah M. Redeuilh G. Mester J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). p21WAF1, a cellular inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase and of the progression in G1 phase of the cell cycle, is induced by sodium butyrate as well as by trichostatin A (8.Steinman R.A. Hoffman B. Iro A. Guillouf C. Liebermann D.A. El-Houseini M.E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3389-3396PubMed Google Scholar, 9.Archer S.Y. Meng S. Shei A. Hodin R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6791-6796Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that in the mouse fibroblast cell line BP-A31 sodium butyrate inhibits the hyperphosphorylation of the tumor suppressor retinoblastoma protein via a transcription-dependent mechanism (10.Buquet-Fagot C. Lallemand F. Charollais R-H. Mester J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 166: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, sodium butyrate induces only a small increase in the level of p21WAF1 transcript in this cell line, suggesting that other butyrate-induced gene products may be involved in its antiproliferative action. Van Lint et al. (11.Van Lint C. Emiliani S. Verdin E. Gene Expr. 1996; 5: 245-253PubMed Google Scholar) showed that only a small subset of gene promoters is sensitive to inhibition of histone deacetylation by trichostatin A. Thus, cloning of transcripts induced by inhibitors of HDAC may facilitate the identification of effectors responsible for the antiproliferative and/or differentiating actions of this class of drugs. Using the differential display technique (12.Liang P. Pardee A.B. Science. 1992; 257: 967-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (4688) Google Scholar), we cloned the cDNA of a new gene transcript induced by sodium butyrate in the mouse fibroblast cell line BP-A31. The protein encoded by this transcript (designated B-ind1 for butyrate-induced 1) does not affect cell proliferation and apoptosis but does appear to participate in the control of the transcriptional activity of NF-κB that is stimulated by sodium butyrate. In this context, we show that B-ind1 acts downstream of the small GTPase Rac1 in the biochemical pathway leading to NF-κB activation. B-ind1 also collaborates with the activated form of Rac1 to induce c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity. Taken together, these data implicate B-ind1 as a novel component of the sodium butyrate and Rac1-signaling pathways that influence the regulation of gene expression. DISCUSSIONThere is strong evidence that the biological effects of HDAC inhibitors are mediated through their ability to directly induce or inhibit the expression of several genes. Our purpose was to search for such genes and study the cellular functions of the corresponding products. Analyzing the differential display PCR patterns obtained with 12 primer combinations, we found two transcripts whose induction by sodium butyrate in the mouse fibroblast cell line BP-A31 was confirmed by Northern blotting. One of these transcripts, B-ind1, was present in quiescent, nontreated cells and was induced by butyrate in a protein synthesis-independent manner. Analysis of the complete cDNA obtained by screening of a human brain cDNA library revealed an open reading frame coding for a protein of 370 amino acids.One important finding of our study is the demonstration that hB-ind1 is involved in the signaling pathway mediated by the small GTPase Rac1. In particular, hB-ind1 potentiated the Rac1-induced transcription and JNK activation. Moreover, the median region comprising amino acids 101–277 acted as a dominant-negative variant to inhibit the induction of the NF-κB-dependent promoter by Rac1. The mechanism of action of hB-ind1 may rely on the formation of complexes between Rac1 and its targets. Although the sequence of hB-ind1 reveals no Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding site, a distinctive domain contained in several previously identified Rac1 targets (25.Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), the existence of protein complexes containing Rac1 and hB-ind1 was evidenced by coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Because other proteins without the Cdc42/Rac-interactive binding site associate with Rac1 (26.Tapon N. Nagata K-I. Lamarche N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), it is possible that hB-ind1 favors the maintenance of Rac1 complexes with its effector systems.

https://openalex.org/W1990146890,"A 58-amino acid region mediates the core transactivation activity of the glucocorticoid receptor τ1 activation domain. This τ1 core domain is unstructured in aqueous buffers, but in the presence of trifluoroethanol three α-helical segments are induced. Two of these putative structural modules have been tested in different combinations with regard to transactivation potentialin vivo and binding capacity to the coactivators in vitro. The results show that whereas single modules are not transcriptionally active, any combination of two or three modules is sufficient, with trimodular constructs having the highest activity. However, proteins containing one, two, or three segments bind Ada2 and cAMP-response element-binding protein with similar affinity. A single segment is thus able to bind a target factor but cannot transactivate target genes significantly. The results are consistent with models in which activation domains are comprised of short activation modules that allow multiple interactions with coactivators. Our results also suggest that an increased number of modules may not result in correspondingly higher affinity but instead that the concentration of binding sites is increased, which gives rise to a higher association rate. This is consistent with a model where the association rate for activator-target factor interactions rather than the equilibrium constant is the most relevant measure of activator potency.

It is generally accepted that these proteins can be subdivided into fully functional DNA-binding domains and activation domains. In the case of activation domains, the concept of modularity has been extended to suggest that these domains are themselves built up of short peptide modules that contribute to gene activation independently of each other but in a synergistic manner (1.Sutherland J.A. Cook A. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Genes Dev. 1992; 6: 1810-1819Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 2.Blair W.S. Bogerd H.P. Madore S.J. Cullen B.R. Mol. Cell.

These ideas lead to the suggestion that even though the subdomains could employ distinct mechanisms, they may be functionally redundant and that it would be the number rather than the composition of the submodules in an activation domain that is of importance for its gene activation potential. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR)1 belongs to the large family of ligand-inducible nuclear receptors that function by modulating the transcription of target genes (6.Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Cell. 1995; 83: 851-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar, 7.Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C. Beato M. Herrlich P. Schutz G. Umesono K. Blumberg B. Kastner P. Mark M. Chambon P. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 835-839Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6064) Google Scholar). The transactivation activity of the human GR is mainly mediated by two domains, τ1 (residues 77–262), which resides at the N terminus of the protein, and τ2 (residues 526–556), which is localized just C-terminally of the DNA-binding domain (DBD) (8.Giguere V. Hollenberg S.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Cell. 1986; 46: 645-652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar, 9.Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 899-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). A small region at the C terminus of the receptor may also play a role in GR-mediated transcription (10.Danielian P.S. White R. Lees J.A. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1025-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (719) Google Scholar). The τ1 domain constitutes the major transactivation function in the GR, and this domain represents the only autonomous activation region within the GR N terminus (9.Hollenberg S.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1988; 55: 899-906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). When fused to a DNA-binding domain, τ1 constitutively activates transcription both in vivo and in vitro (11.Wright A.P. McEwan I.J. Dahlman-Wright K. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1366-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 12.McEwan I.J. Wright A.P. Dahlman-Wright K. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 399-407Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A 58-amino acid segment that represents the core activation domain (the τ1 core) has been localized to residues 187–244 (13.Dahlman-Wright K. Almlöf T. McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J.A. Wright A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1619-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This domain retains 60–70% of the activity conferred by the intact τ1 domain (13.Dahlman-Wright K. Almlöf T. McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J.A. Wright A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1619-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The τ1 core domain belongs to the group of acidic activators because of its relative abundance of acidic amino acid residues.

However, in trifluoroethanol, the τ1 core forms α-helices, which is also consistent with studies of the VP16 (21.Donaldson L. Capone J.P. J. Biol.

Three putative α-helical regions in the τ1 core have been identified by NMR spectroscopy (25.Dahlman-Wright K. Baumann H. McEwan I.J. Almlöf T. Wright A.P. Gustafsson J.A. Hard T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1699-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Proline substitution mutants within two of the putative helical regions reduce the transactivation activity of the τ1 core and also its ability to form α-helices in trifluoroethanol (24.Dahlman-Wright K. McEwan I.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 1323-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). α-Helix formation may thus be an important step in τ1-mediated gene activation, and it is possible that target factor interactions induce or stabilize a structured conformation in the activation domain similar to the situation that has been demonstrated for activation domains of p53 (26.Kussie P.H.

If this model is correct for the τ1 core, the α-helices that can be induced in the τ1 core peptide can be considered as structural modules. In this study we wanted to further address whether the τ1 core domain is composed of modules with distinct and independent functions or whether it should be viewed as a structurally integrated protein domain. The results reported here provide evidence for a model in which the τ1 core activation domain is built up of small modules with acidic and hydrophobic character, each of which interacts with target protein(s) to give efficient activation of transcription. Furthermore, the ability of constructs consisting of duplicated and triplicated modules of the same type to activate transcription suggests that the individual segments do not carry determinants absolutely critical for transactivation function. The Saccharomyces cerevisiaestrain W303–1A (MATa, ade2–1°,can1–100°, his3–11, 15, leu2–3, 112, trp1–1a, ura3–1) was used as the yeast host cell for all experiments in the study. TheEscherichia coli strain BL21(DE3)plysS (Novagen) was used for GST and GST fusion protein expression. pKVBB-GRDBD-τ1 core and pKVBB-GRDBD-τ1-(187−227) express τ1 core and τ1-(187−227), respectively, fused to the GR DBD. The plasmid pKVBB-GRDBD was generated from plasmid pKV-XE (11.Wright A.P. McEwan I.J. Dahlman-Wright K. Gustafsson J.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1366-1372Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) by destroying the existingBamHI site and inserting a linker containing aBamHI and a BglII site in the SacI site. BamHI-BglII fragments corresponding to τ1 core-H1 and τ1 core-H2 were amplified by PCR using the following primers: 5′-CAGCAGGGATCCCCTGACCAAAGCACCTTTGACAT-3′ and 5′-CCACCAAGATCTATTCGTCTCTTTACCTGGGG-3′ for the H1 fragment and 5′-CAGCAGGGATCCCCTTGGAGATCAGACCTGTTG-3′ and 5′-CCACCAAGATCTATTCGTCTCTTTACCAGGAGAAAGCAAACAGTTTTC-3′ for the H2 fragment. In this way amino acid sequence GKETN (from the region following the H1 segment) is joined to the end of the H2 module, thus giving a similar linker sequence between any two segments in the different combinations. Plasmid pKVBB-GRDBD expressing GR DBD was cleaved with BamHI and BglII, and the PCR fragments were inserted, resulting in plasmids pKVBB-GRDBD-H1 and pKVBB-GRDBD-H2, respectively. To obtain pKVBB-GRDBD-H1-H1, -H1-H2, -H2-H2, and -H2-H1, pKVBB-GRDBD-H1 and pKVBB-GRDBD-H2 were linearized by BglII, and the BamHI-BglII PCR fragments were inserted. The following trisegment plasmid constructs were made using the same strategy: pKVBB-GRDBD-H1-H1-H1, -H1-H2-H1, -H1-H1-H2, -H2-H1-H1, and -H2-H2-H2. The GR-responsive lacZreporter gene contains two glucocorticoid response elements from the rat tyrosine aminotransferase promotor cloned upstream of a basalCYC1-lacZ promotor and is contained in the vector pLGZ-2xTAT, described previously (29.Wright A.P. Gustafsson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8283-8287Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). GST fusion plasmids pGEX-Ada2 and pGEX-CBP-C2 (amino acids 1678–1868) have been described previously (30.Almlöf T. Wallberg A.E. Gustafsson J.A. Wright A.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9586-9594Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Plasmids were transformed into the yeast strains using a spheroplast procedure (31.Beggs J.D. Nature. 1978; 275: 104-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar). Several colonies from each transformation were checked on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-galactopyranoside (X-gal) plates for homogeneity of transactivation activity (32.Bohen S.P. Yamamoto K.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11424-11428Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Representative transformants were grown in minimal medium with 2% glucose for at least 18 h. The cultures were then diluted to anA 600 of 0.2 in minimal medium with 3% glycerol and 1% ethanol and grown for 24 h. After 24 h the cultures were diluted to an A 600 of 0.2 in minimal medium containing 2% galactose and cultured for an additional 4–5 h. Extracts were prepared and assayed for β-galactosidase activity as described previously (33.Wright A.P. Carlstedt-Duke J. Gustafsson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14763-14769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast extracts were prepared using the rapid protein extraction procedure described by Horvath and Riezman (34.Horvath A. Riezman H. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1305-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The proteins in the extracts were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 12% polyacrylamide resolving gels and then electrophoretically transferred to Hybond-C membranes at 4 °C (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using standard procedures. The membranes were blocked with 5% milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) overnight. The membranes were incubated for 60 min at room temperature with a monoclonal antibody raised against GR DNA-binding domain (kindly provided by Ann-Charlotte Wikström and Marika Rönnholm, Department of Medical Nutrition, Karolinska Institutet) in PBS-T. After washing, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulin G antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in PBS-T for 60 min. The membranes were then thoroughly washed and developed using chemiluminescence with an ECL mixture (68 mm p-coumaric acid, 1.25 mm luminol in Tris, pH 8.5, 0.009% H2O2). Transformant W303–1A cells were grown as described above under “Transactivation Assay in Yeast.” Total RNA was prepared as described by Schmitt et al. (35.Schmitt M.E. Brown T.A. Trumpower B.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 3091-3092Crossref PubMed Scopus (1152) Google Scholar) and then run on denaturing MOPS gels and blotted onto Hybond-N filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described in Ref. 36.Brown T. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 4.9.1-4.9.14Google Scholar. For prehybridization, hybridization, washing, and detection, the Gene Images CDP-Star detection module (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Preparation of fluorescein-labeled probes for hybridization was done using the Gene Images random-prime labeling module (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and with a GR-DBD PCR fragment and a HindIII-BamHI actin fragment as templates. GST and GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified essentially as described previously (30.Almlöf T. Wallberg A.E. Gustafsson J.A. Wright A.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9586-9594Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). PCR was run in which the different pKVBB-GRDBD plasmids served as templates and the following primers were used: 5′-CGAATTAACCCTCACTAAAGGGAACGCCGCCAC CATGGTCAATTCGAGCTCAGGATCCCC-3′ and 5′-TCAACCATGGTCAATTCCTTTTAT-3′. [35S]Methionine-labeled proteins were generated byin vitro transcription/translation of the PCR products containing a 5′-T3 promotor using a TnT kit (Promega) at 30 °C for 90 min. The in vitro translated proteins were incubated with approximately 1 μg of glutathione-Sepharose-bound GST proteins in 200 μl of pull-down buffer (20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm KCl, 0.2 mmEDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm dithiothreitol) also containing Nonidet P-40 and bovine serum albumin to total concentrations of 0.01% (v/v) and 1.5% (w/v), respectively. Incubation with rotation was carried out at 4 °C for 2 h. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with 400 μl of pull-down buffer by rotating 15 min at 4 °C. Washed beads were resuspended in 20 μl of 1 × SDS sample buffer, boiled for 10 min, and pelleted in a microcentrifuge. 10 μl of supernatant was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (15% polyacrylamide resolving gel). To monitor the stability and equal loading of the GST fusion proteins, gels were stained with Coomassie Blue before autoradiography. A schematic representation of the τ1 core transactivation domain of human GR is shown in Fig. 1 A. The location of segments with propensity for α-helical formation as identified by NMR is also shown. The amino acid sequences of the τ1 core, τ1-(187–227), H1, and H2 are shown in Fig. 1 B. To investigate whether the putative helical segments in the τ1 core are interchangeable and to see how the transactivation activity is affected by both the order and number of segments, different combinations of H1 and H2 were fused to the GR DBD (Fig.2). Previous mutagenesis and deletion studies (13.Dahlman-Wright K. Almlöf T. McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J.A. Wright A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1619-1623Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 14.Almlöf T. Gustafsson J.A. Wright A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 934-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) of the τ1 core domain have indicated a less important role for H3 compared with H1 and H2. Because of this and for practical reasons in the experimental design, the H1 and H2 segments were used in this study. The different proteins were expressed in yeast cells in which expression of β-galactosidase is controlled by two glucocorticoid-responsive elements. The β-galactosidase data obtained from yeast strain W303–1A (Fig. 2) show that one segment only is not enough for significant activation but that any combination of two segments is sufficient to give transcriptional activation. The level of activation achieved with two segments is lower than for τ1-(187–227) but still significant. Constructs containing three segments showed a transactivation potential comparable with the wild type τ1 core. The exceptions are constructs containing only one type of module,i.e. the H1-H1-H1 and H2-H2-H2 proteins, which both had a lower transactivation activity than did the wild type τ1 core. By these criteria, the H1 and H2 segments appear to function as interchangeable modules that contribute synergistically to gene activation. However, to be able to draw firm conclusions from the transactivation activity data, the expression levels of the different proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using an antibody against GR DBD. Data in Fig. 3 show protein levels to be very similar except for constructs containing only H1 segments, which were expressed at a much lower level. With longer exposure times, however, bands of the predicted size of H1, H1-H1, and H1-H1-H1 could be detected (data not shown).Figure 3Immunoblot analysis of expression levels of the τ1 core, τ1-(187–227), and different H1 and H2 combinations. Aliquots containing equivalent amounts of protein from whole cell yeast extracts were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The GR DBD fusion proteins were detected with an antibody against GR DBD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Because gene expression is often regulated at the level of transcription, it is necessary to investigate whether the observed differences in protein levels are due to differences at the mRNA level. The transcript levels of selected constructs were assayed by Northern blotting of total RNA extracted from W303–1A yeast cells expressing the corresponding constructs using probes that hybridize to GR DBD and actin (internal control) mRNA. The results show that very similar amounts of mRNA were produced by the different constructs (Fig. 4). Consequently, the differences seen in protein expression levels for the H1, H1-H1, and H1-H1-H1 constructs cannot be accounted for by differences at the level of transcription but must originate at the level of protein synthesis or protein stability. Ada2 and CBP proteins are coactivators known to bind to the τ1 core (30.Almlöf T. Wallberg A.E. Gustafsson J.A. Wright A.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9586-9594Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 37.Henriksson A. Almlöf T. Ford J. McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J.A. Wright A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3065-3073Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To test whether the binding capacity of the τ1 core to coactivators correlates with the demonstrated transcriptional activity, an in vitro protein-protein interaction assay was performed using GST-Ada2 and GST-CBP-C2 fusion proteins and the [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translated τ1 core and different H segment proteins. As shown in Fig. 5 A, proteins containing one, two, or three H2 segments resulted in similar binding to both Ada2 and CBP-C2, but no binding to GST alone was seen. Furthermore, several constructs containing combinations of H1 and H2 modules did not show significantly higher binding affinity (Fig.5 B). The τ1 core included in the experiment as a control showed a similar binding affinity to that of the other constructs. Thus, the substantially higher activity seen in the transactivation experiments for the multisegment constructs is not due to a dramatically higher affinity for target factor binding. The τ1 core activation domain of GR contains three putative α-helical structural segments (25.Dahlman-Wright K. Baumann H. McEwan I.J. Almlöf T. Wright A.P. Gustafsson J.A. Hard T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1699-1703Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) that have been shown previously to have an important role in the transcriptional activation function of the GR receptor (30.Almlöf T. Wallberg A.E. Gustafsson J.A. Wright A.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9586-9594Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In this study we have used a hybrid protein approach involving different combinations of the H1 and H2 activation submodules of the τ1 core to analyze the functional dependence on the modular structure. The purpose of the study was to address whether the τ1 core region should be viewed as a structurally integrated domain or as composed of redundant submodules. We have demonstrated that isolated H1 and H2 segments do not have significant residual activities on their own (Fig. 2). We have further shown that duplication of H1 and H2 segments in different combinations is sufficient for transcriptional activation. Results obtained with the duplication constructs also showed that neither segment carries unique determinants absolutely critical for transactivation function. In addition, trimodular constructs gave rise to higher transactivation activity than the duplication constructs, reaching levels comparable with the wild type τ1 core. These results support the model, mentioned in the introduction, in which activation domains are composed of short, partly redundant modules (1.Sutherland J.A. Cook A. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T.

Furthermore, α-helical structure formation of acidic activator domains upon binding to putative target factors has been demonstrated in circular dichroism studies of the c-Myc activation domain bound to TATA-binding protein (38.McEwan I.J.

Moreau J. Levine A.J. Pavletich N.P. Science. 1996; 274: 948-953Crossref PubMed Scopus (1782) Google Scholar), fluorescence analyses of the interaction of the VP16 activator domain with TATA-binding protein (27.Shen F. Triezenberg S.J. Hensley P. Porter D. Knutson J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4827-4837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and NMR studies of the VP16 activator domain upon interaction with TAF31 (28.Uesugi M. Nyanguile O. Lu H. Levine A.J. Verdine G.L. Science. 1997; 277: 1310-1313Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). These studies are consistent with an induced fit model for the folding of an otherwise unstructured activator domain. These findings together with the ability of the H1-only or H2-only proteins (e.g. H1-H1 and H2-H2) to activate transcription, shown here, suggest that secondary structure formation and/or formation of hydrophobic surfaces are likely to be more important for transcriptional activation than the primary amino acid sequence as such. However, our study also indicates that the two modules H1 and H2 are functionally distinct, at least in part. First, combinations of H1 and H2 are always better activators than H1-only or H2-only alternatives. Second, the H2 module has a positive effect on the protein levels of the constructs in which it is contained. Presumably, it either facilitates production or perhaps more likely stabilizes these proteins. In addition, H1 may have higher activation potential than H2 because a comparably high transactivation was observed for the relatively low protein levels of the H1-only constructs. Previous studies have shown an exquisite proportionality between binding affinity and transcription potential for different τ1 core amino acid substitution mutants (30.Almlöf T. Wallberg A.E. Gustafsson J.A. Wright A.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9586-9594Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It was therefore important to show whether this is also true for the constructs described here, which differ widely in activity. The results show that the different constructs bind each target factor, Ada2 or CBP, with similar affinity (Fig. 5). The dramatically higher transactivation observed for the trimodular constructs (of different combinations) compared with the mono-modular constructs is therefore not due to an increased overall binding affinity to target factors. Thus, large deletions in the τ1 core do not change target factor binding affinity but severely affect transactivation potential so that the previously observed proportionality between binding affinity and transactivation activity is lost. An explanation probably lies in the fact that the number of binding modules was kept constant in the previous study (with the full-length τ1 core) whereas it was varied in the present study. It has been shown that different components of the transcription initiation complex (e.g. TATA-binding protein, Ada2, and CBP) are able to bind to the τ1 core domain (30.Almlöf T. Wallberg A.E. Gustafsson J.A. Wright A.P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9586-9594Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 37.Henriksson A. Almlöf T. Ford J. McEwan I.J. Gustafsson J.A. Wright A.P. Mol. Cell.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1467-1475Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). That several transcription factors and coactivators are molecular targets for acidic activators has also been shown for activators such as VP16, NF-κB p65, and HNF-4. Examples of targets include TATA-binding protein, TFIIB, TAFII31, TAFII80, CBP, Ada2, and PC4 (20.Green V.J. Kokkotou E. Ladias J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29950-29957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 40.Stringer K.F. Ingles C.J. Greenblatt J.

Protein-protein in vitro interaction assays monitor binding affinity for one target factor at a time, whereas transactivation assays measure transcription activity in vivo where many different target factors/coactivators are present. Our results could therefore imply that multiple interactions are required for efficient transactivation. The stoichiometry of the binding of the τ1 core to target proteins has not been determined. The presence of multiple redundant modules would also increase the concentration of binding sites that can interact with the target factors and thereby give rise to a higher association rate. The requirement for multiple modules, as demonstrated in this study, thus suggests that the modular architecture of the activation domain may underlie its ability to activate gene transcription by influencing the kinetics through changes in association rate of its interaction with one or more target factors. This model would be consistent with our previous results showing proportionality between activation potential and binding affinity in τ1 core mutants if the affinity changes observed for these mutants are also accompanied by changes in target factor interaction kinetics. In the future, direct association and dissociation measurements have to be made to test this model. The similar properties in terms of hydrophobicity, acidic amino acid content, propensity for α-helical formation, and modular structure of the τ1 core and other acidic activation domains could reflect a general mechanism for such activators, which would involve complex and dynamic interactions with different target factors acting synergistically to achieve efficient activation of transcription.

We also showed that the envelope incorporation into virions is not affected when the wild-type envelope is coexpressed with the mutant envelope. These results suggest that an oligomeric structure of the cytoplasmic domain is functionally required for viral infectivity. To understand whether the cytoplasmic domain of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transmembrane protein gp41 has the potential to self-assemble as an oligomer, in the present study we fused the coding sequence of the entire cytoplasmic domain at 3′ to theEscherichia coli malE gene, which encodes a monomeric maltose-binding protein. The expressed fusion protein was examined by chemical cross-linking, sucrose gradient centrifugation, and gel filtration. The results showed that the cytoplasmic domain of gp41 assembles into a high-ordered structural complex. The intersubunit interaction of the cytoplasmic domain was also confirmed by a mammalian two-hybrid system that detects protein-protein interactions in eucaryotic cells. A cytoplasmic domain fragment expressed in eucaryotic cells was pulled down by glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads via its association with another cytoplasmic domain fragment fused to the C terminus of the glutathione S-transferase moiety. We also found that sequences encompassing the lentiviral lytic peptide-1 and lentiviral lytic peptide-2, which are located within residues 828–856 and 770–795, respectively, play a critical role in cytoplasmic domain self-assembly. Taken together, the results from the present study indicate that the cytoplasmic domain of gp41 by itself is sufficient to assemble into a multimeric structure.

This region overlaps a highly conserved leucine zipper-like heptad repeat sequence adjacent to the N-terminal fusion peptide sequence. The leucine zipper-like motif plays a crucial role in viral infectivity and membrane fusion (5.Dubay J.W. Robers S.J. Haln B.H. Hunter E. J.

The six-stranded coiled-coil structure, formed by the leucine zipper-like motif and the C-terminal α-helix located in the ectodomain of gp41 and proximal to the TM domain, represents a fusion active conformation of the TM core (9.Chan D.C.

A striking feature of primate immunodeficiency virus Env proteins is their unusually long (about 150 amino acids) cytoplasmic domains. The cytoplasmic domain of HIV-1 gp41, spanning residues 706–856, plays various roles in virus replication, infectivity, transmissibility, and cytopathogenicity (5.Dubay J.W. Robers S.J. Haln B.H.

The C terminus of the cytoplasmic tail may play a role in viral uncoating or penetration of the viral core into host cells (18.Gabuzda D.H. Lever A. Terwilliger E. Sodroski J. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 3306-3315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The large helical hydrophobic moments of the two segments spanning residues 828–856 and 770–795 (19.Eisenberg D. Wesson M.

Biopolymers. 1990; 29: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Structural modeling of these two regions reveals a high potential to form amphipathic α-helices (19.Eisenberg D. Wesson M.

These putative α-helices are structurally similar to those formed by natural cytolytic peptides such as magainins, cecropins, melittin, etc., produced by certain amphibians and insects. The interactions of these cytolytic peptides with membranes are well studied (21.Miller M.A. Montelaro R.C. Aloia R.C. Advances in Membrane Fluidity. 6. A. R.

Synthetic peptides representing LLP-1 and LLP-2 motifs lyse human erythrocytes and are toxic to procaryotic and eucaryotic cells when added exogenously to cultures (22.Miller M.A. Garry R.F.

Expression of the C-terminal portion of the cytoplasmic domain where LLP-1 and LLP-2 are localized perturbs membrane permeability inEscherichia coli cells (26.Arroyo J. Boceta M. González M.E. Michel M. Carrasco L. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 4095-4102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon binding to the lipid bilayers, the LLP-1 peptide undergoes a transition from a random coil to an ordered lipid-associated helical conformation (23.Gawrisch K. Han K.-H. Yang J.-S. Bergelson L.D.

Chem. 1992; 267: 7121-7127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane and pH-induced increase in the helical content may increase the likelihood of self-association and formation of a multimeric structure upon binding to the membrane. Nevertheless, the structural requirements for cytoplasmic domain-mediated viral entry and for permeable pathways and cytopathogenesis mediated by the LLPs of gp41 remain obscure. We previously reported that an Env mutant, which lacks the whole cytoplasmic domain and the last two amino acids in the TM domain, encoded by an HIV-1 mutant provirus dominantly interferes with wild-type (wt) virus infectivity (27.Chen S.S.-L. Ferrante A.A. Terwilliger E.F. Virology. 1996; 226: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Also, Env incorporation into virions is not affected when a wt provirus is coexpressed with this mutant provirus (27.Chen S.S.-L. Ferrante A.A. Terwilliger E.F. Virology. 1996; 226: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The dominant interference phenotype conferred by this truncated Env is due to the formation of a dysfunctional hetero-oligomeric complex of the mutant with the wt Env (27.Chen S.S.-L. Ferrante A.A. Terwilliger E.F. Virology. 1996; 226: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In a later study, we observed that this truncated Env mutant interferes with HIV-1 transmission when the env gene of the truncated mutant is targeted to HeLa-CD4 clones (28.Chen S.S.-L. Lee S.-F. Chuang C.-K. Raj V.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8290-8302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although previous mutagenesis studies did not reveal a plausible role for the HIV-1 cytoplasmic domain in Env assembly (3.Earl P.L. Doms R.W. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 4.Earl P.L. Moss B. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1993; 9: 589-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the dominant interference by this cytoplasmic domain truncated mutant (27.Chen S.S.-L. Ferrante A.A. Terwilliger E.F. Virology. 1996; 226: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 28.Chen S.S.-L. Lee S.-F. Chuang C.-K. Raj V.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8290-8302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggests that the cytoplasmic domain, folding as an oligomeric structure, is functionally required for gp41-mediated viral entry. To further assess the evidence that the cytoplasmic domain participates in gp41-mediated tertiary structure formation, in the present study we set out to determine whether the cytoplasmic domain physically associates into a multimeric structure. We expressed the cytoplasmic domain as a fusion partner of a monomeric E. colimaltose-binding protein (MBP) (29.Blondel A. Dedouelle B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 193: 325-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and examined the multimeric structure of this fusion protein. We also performed a mammalian two-hybrid assay and a glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assay to determine the specific interactions between cytoplasmic domain subunits. Our results show that the cytoplasmic domain by itself is sufficient to assemble into a high-ordered multimer. The results also reveal that the two LLP sequences located in the cytoplasmic domain play a crucial role in cytoplasmic domain self-assembly. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that a multimeric structure of the gp41 cytoplasmic domain is critical for viral infectivity. pMal-c2 (New England BioLabs, Beverly, MA), is aP tac promoter-driven bacterial expression plasmid for expression of target genes fused downstream of the E. coli malE gene (30.Guan C. Li P. Riggs P.D. Inouye H. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 67: 21-30Crossref Scopus (546) Google Scholar), which encodes a monomeric E. coliMBP. pSVE7-puro encodes the HXB2 Env protein under the control of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (28.Chen S.S.-L. Lee S.-F. Chuang C.-K. Raj V.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8290-8302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pSVE7-puromutant plasmids, each separately encoding an Env protein with a deletion after residue 844, 813, 795, 775, or 752 to the C terminus of the cytoplasmic domain, were previously described (28.Chen S.S.-L. Lee S.-F. Chuang C.-K. Raj V.S. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 8290-8302Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pSRS/SIV is a pSRS vector that encodes an StuI fragment (nucleotides 6128–10045), which encompasses the env, tat, andrev genes, from the SIVmac239 genome (31.Johnston P.B. Dubay J.W. Hunter E. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3077-3086Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pM and pVP16 are mammalian two-hybrid vectors that encode the Gal4 DNA-binding domain and the herpes simplex virus transcriptional activator VP16 activation domain, respectively. pG5CAT encodes five consensus Gal4-binding sites (UASG) and an adenovirus E1B minimal promoter upstream of a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene. pEBG is a mammalian elongation factor 1α promoter-driven GST expression vector (32.Cortes P. Weis-Garcia F. Misulovin Z. Nussenzweig A. Lai J.-S. Li G. Nussenzweig M.C. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14008-14013Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). pRK5F is a cytomegalovirus promoter-driven expression plasmid in which a FLAG tag-coding sequence is inserted in the polycloning site (33.Feng X.-H. Filvaroff E.H. Derynck R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24237-24245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). For construction of pMal-c2 plasmids that express segments corresponding to different regions of the cytoplasmic domain of the HIV-1 Env (see Fig. 1), wt, or mutant pSVE7-puro plasmids were primed with paired forward and reverse oligonucleotides in PCR. All amplification reactions used oligonucleotide 856rSalI (5′-CCGTCGACTTATAGCAAAATCCTTTCCA-3′; 8794–8775) as a reverse primer. The nucleotides underlined indicate the recognition sequence of the restriction enzyme as indicated in the name of the oligonucleotide. The numbers shown after the sequence indicate the nucleotide positions of the env sequence of the primer in the HXB2 proviral genome. The reverse primer 856rSalI contains a stop codon following the codon for Leu at residue 856 of the HIV-1 Env. To generate the coding sequences of 706–856, 760–856, 789–856, 805–856, and 816–856, wt pSVE7-puro was used as the template and oligonucleotides 706fEcoRI (5′-CGGAATTCAATAGAGTTAGGCAGGGATAT-3′; 8339–8359), 760fEcoRI (5′-CCGAATTCCTGCGGAGCCTGTGCC-3′; 8501–8516), 789fEcoRI (5′-CCGAATTCGGGTGGGAAGCCCTCAA-3′; 8588–8604), 805fEcoRI (5′-CCGAATTCCAGGAACTAAAGAATAGTGC-3′; 8636–8655), and 816fEcoRI (5′-GCGAATTCAATGCCACAGCCATAGC-3′; 8669–8685), respectively, were used as the forward primers. To obtain the coding sequences of 706–844, 706–813, 706–795, 706–775, and 706–752, oligonucleotide 706fEcoRI was used as the forward primer, and TM844, TM813, TM795, TM775, and TM752, respectively, of pSVE7-puro were used as the templates. To construct the coding sequences for 760–795 and 760–775, oligonucleotide 760fEcoRI was used as the forward primer, and TM795 and TM775, respectively, were used as the templates. To construct the 816–844 coding sequence, 816fEcoRI and TM844 were used as the forward primer and template, respectively. The 252–273 coding sequence was generated by PCR using 252fEcoRI (5′-CCGAATTCAGGCCAGTAGTATCAACT-3′; 6977–6994) and 273rSalI (5′-CCGTCGACTTATCTAATTACTACCTCTTCTTCTG-3′; 7042–7020) as primers and wt pSVE7-puro as the template. The reverse primer 273rSalI contains a stop codon following the codon for Arg at 273 of the HIV-1 Env. To obtain the coding sequence of the entire cytoplasmic domain of SIV Env, pSRS/SIV was primed with SIVenv716fEcoRI (5′-CGGAATTCAAGTTAAGGCAGGGG-3′; 9005–9019 of the SIVmac239 genome) and SIVenv879rSalI (5′-CCGTCGACTCACAAGAGAGTGAGCTC-3′; 9499–9482 of the SIVmac239 provirus) in PCR. Reverse primer SIVenv879rSalI contains a stop codon following the codon for Leu at 879 of the SIV Env. TheEcoRI- and SalI-digested DNA fragments were inserted in the corresponding sites of pMal-c2 to produce various pMal-c2 expression plasmids. For construction of mammalian two-hybrid plasmids that encode the cytoplasmic domain, theEcoRI-SalI fragment isolated from pMal/706–856 that encodes the entire cytoplasm domain-coding region was cloned into the corresponding sites in the polycloning sequence of pM to produce pM-Env and into pVP16 to produce pVP16-Env. To increase the sensitivity of detection in the mammalian two-hybrid system, the stretch of the DNA sequence containing the Gal4-responsive element and the adenovirus E1b minimal promoter in pG5CAT was cloned by PCR using UASGfSacI (5′-CCGAGCTCGAGGACAGTACTCCGCTCGG-3′) and UASGrBglII (5′-CCAGATCTTTTAGCTTCCTTAGCTCCTGAAAA-3′) as primers. TheSacI-BglII DNA fragment was then inserted in the polycloning sites of the pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI), which lacks any eucaryotic enhancer/promoter sequence upstream to a luciferase-coding sequence, to produce the pGL3(UASG) reporter vector. For construction of pEBG/706–856 that encodes a GST-cytoplasmic domain fusion protein, oligonucleotides 706fSpeI (5′-CGGACTAGTAATAGAGTTAGGCAGGGATAT-3′; 8339–8359) and 856rAsp718 (5′-CCCGGTACCTTATAGCAAAATCCTTTCCA-3′; 8794–8775) were used as primers in PCR. For construction of pRK5F/706–856, which encodes a cytoplasmic domain fragment N-terminal to a FLAG tag, a PCR reaction using oligonucleotides 706fEcoRI(Met) (5′-CGGAATTCGCCGCCATGAATAGAGTTAGGCAGGGATAT-3′) and 856rSalI(no stop) (5′-CCGTCGACTAGCAAAATCCTTTCCA-3′) as primers was performed. pRK5F/706–856 encodes a Kozak sequence 5′ to the ATG initiation codon, which is followed by the cytoplasmic domain-coding sequence. The cytoplasmic domain coding sequence was fused in frame to the FLAG tag-coding sequence. PCR was performed in 100 μl of buffer containing 50 ng of templates, 0.2 mm of each dNTPs, 2 μm each of the forward and reverse primers, and 5 units of Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). In addition to an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 4 min, the samples were subjected to the following amplification programs: (a) five cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 45 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s; (b) five cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s; (c) five cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 54 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s; and (d) fifteen cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s using a GeneAmp PCR System 2400 (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT). A final extension step was allowed to proceed at 72 °C for 4 min before cooling down to room temperature. All pMal-c2 expression plasmids were autosequenced using the malE primer5′-GGTCGTCAGACTGTCGATGAAGCC-3′ (New England BioLabs) to confirm the cytoplasmic domain and 252–273 coding sequences. Theenv gene in pEBG/706–856 and pRK5F/706–856 were sequenced by oligonucleotides 5′-CAGCAAGTATATAGCATGGCC-3′ and Sp6 primer 5′-GATTTAGGTGACACTATAG-3′, respectively. The pMal constructs were used to transform competent NM522 or AD494 cells (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI). MBP fusion proteins were isopropylthiogalactopyranoside-induced and expressed as described previously (34.Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Chanda V.B. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995: 16.6.1-16.6.14Google Scholar). The bacterial pellets were sonicated in 12 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 3.2 mmKCl and 137 mm NaCl (referred to as PBS hereafter) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride in a 1:10 ratio of the volume of the sonication buffer to that of the initial culture. A final concentration of 0.2% glucose was added to the initial cultures prior to isopropylthiogalactopyranoside induction when purification of MBP fusion proteins was desired. Fusion proteins were purified on an amylose resin affinity column (New England BioLabs) in PBS according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. Fusion proteins MBP/706–856 and MBP/252–273 and standard molecular mass markers (obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech and Sigma) in a total volume of 0.5 ml were sedimented in parallel by linear 10–45% sucrose gradient centrifugation. The gradients prepared in PBS were centrifuged at 40,000 rpm in a Beckman SW41 rotor at 4 °C for 20 h. After centrifugation, proteins were collected from the bottom of the gradients. Gradient performance was checked by reading the refraction index of sucrose using a Fisher refractometer. Aliquots of fractionated samples were separated by SDS-7.5% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) followed by Western blotting analysis. Purified MBP/706–856 was incubated with different concentrations of a cross-linker glutaraldehyde in PBS with a total volume of 40 μl on ice for 30 min and then quenched with the addition of a final concentration of 100 mm glycine, pH 8.0. The mixture was kept on ice for 30 min prior to SDS-7.5% PAGE followed by Western blotting. Aliquots (0.2 ml) containing 25–100 μg of purified fusion proteins or molecular mass markers were fractionated by gel filtration through a Superose 6 HR column (10 × 300 mm, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted with PBS. The column was run with an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech fast protein liquid chromatography system equipped with a UV monitor at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at room temperature, and samples were collected at 1-min intervals. Aliquots of fractionated fusion proteins were analyzed by Western blotting using various antibodies to detect fusion proteins. Aliquots of fractionated molecular markers were also measured for protein concentrations using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. Alternatively, purified MBP fusion proteins and molecular markers were passed over the Superose 6 column and eluted with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100. Because Triton X-100 interferes with UV absorption at 280 nm, aliquots of fractionated markers were assessed for protein concentrations using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit. 293 cells were cotransfected with the two-hybrid paired plasmids pM-Env and pVP16-Env along with pG5CAT or pGL3(UASG) by the calcium phosphate coprecipitation method as described previously (27.Chen S.S.-L. Ferrante A.A. Terwilliger E.F. Virology. 1996; 226: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 35.Chen S.S.-L. Lee S.-F. Hao H.-J. Chuang C.-K. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 4765-4774Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids of pM and pVP16 were added into transfections in which pM-Env or pVP16-Env was not included to keep the total amounts of DNA in all transfections constant. When HeLa cells were examined, LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) was used in transfection according to the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. For pG5CAT transfection, cell lysates were assayed for CAT activity as described previously (27.Chen S.S.-L. Ferrante A.A. Terwilliger E.F. Virology. 1996; 226: 260-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For pGL3(UASG) transfection, cell lysates were measured for luciferase activity using a luciferase assay reagent (Promega). The luminescent light produced was quantitated on a Lumac Biocounter M2500 (Landgraaf, the Netherlands). COS-1 cells were transfected with either pEBG/706–856 or pRK5F/706–856 or cotransfected with pEBG/706–856 and pRK5F/706–856 by the DEAE-dextran method as described previously (6.Chen S.S.-L. Lee C.-N. Lee W.-R. McIntosh K. Lee T.-H. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 3615-3619Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids of pEBG and pRK5F were added into transfections in which pEBG/706–856 or pRK5F/706–856 was not included to keep the total amount of DNA in all transfections constant. Two days after transfection, cells were washed once with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 1 mm EDTA (TE buffer) and scraped off from the plates. The washed cells were then resuspended in 1.0 ml of TE butter containing 10% (w/v) sucrose, and complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The resuspended cells were sonicated on ice twice, each time for 15 s, and then centrifuged at 2,700 rpm in a Sorvall RMC 14 centrifuge (DuPont) at 4 °C for 10 min. Aliquots of postnuclear supernatants were incubated with 50 μl of washed glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed with PBS and then boiled at 95 °C for 3 min. The proteins released from beads were resolved by SDS-15% PAGE followed by Western blotting using mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) Chessie 8, which recognizes residues 727–732 of the HIV-1 Env protein. To obtain a clearer picture of the role of the gp41 cytoplasmic domain in the viral life cycle, the autonomous structural and oligomerization domains in this region were explored. The entire cytoplasmic domain-coding sequence from residues 706–856 of the Env of the HXB2 strain was cloned by PCR and fused downstream of the E. coli malE gene in pMal-c2 (Fig.1). The fusion protein encoded by themalE gene contains 461 residues including MBP,lacZ-α, and the residues encoded by the sequence downstream to the lacZ-α gene but before the termination codon. As a control for oligomerization, pMal/252–273, which encodes residues 252–273, located in gp120, also known as the epitope of mAb Chessie 13, was also constructed by PCR. The MBP fusion proteins 706–856 and 252–273 contained a total of 542 and 413 residues, respectively. The pMal plasmids were used to transform competent NM522 cells, and the fusion proteins were expressed following isopropylthiogalactopyranoside induction. The apparent molecular masses of MBP, MBP/706–856, and MBP/252–273 were 45, 58, and 42 kDa, respectively, as determined by SDS-7.5% PAGE followed by Western blotting using mAb anti-MBP (36.Hsu S.-C. Yan B.-S. Pan J.-M. Syu W.-J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 204: 169-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) (data not shown). To determine whether the cytoplasmic domain assembled as an oligomeric form, the expressed fusion protein MBP/706–856 and molecular mass markers were sedimented in parallel through linear 10–45% sucrose gradient centrifugation. After sedimentation, gradients were fractionated from the bottom, and aliquots of the fractions were resolved by SDS-7.5% PAGE followed by Western blotting using pooled anti-HIV antisera. MBP/706–856 sedimented to fractions 7–17 and with a peak approximately at fractions 11–13"

In this paper we show by biochemical methods and electron microscopy that the extracellular ectodomain of purified HIV and simian immunodeficiency virus gp41 (e-gp41) forms a mixture of soluble high molecular weight aggregate and native trimer at physiological pH. The e-gp41 aggregate is shown to be largely α-helical and relatively stable to denaturants. The high molecular weight form of e-gp41 is variable in size ranging from 7 to 70 trimers, which associate by interactions at the interior of the aggregate involving the loop that connects the N- and C-terminal helices of the e-gp41 core. The trimers are predominantly arranged with their long axes oriented radially, and the width of the high molecular weight aggregate corresponds to the length of two e-gp41 trimers (∼200 Å). Using both light and electron microscopy combined with immunohistochemistry we show that HIV gp41 accumulates as an extracellular aggregate in the brains of HIV-infected patients diagnosed with dementia. We postulate that the high molecular weight aggregates of e-gp41 are responsible for HIV-associated neurological damage and dementia, consistent with known mechanisms of encephalopathy.

In the present paper, we correlate the biochemical behavior and EM appearance of HIV and SIV e-gp41 with the neuropathology observed in patients diagnosed with HAD. The present study suggests that the accumulation of a highly stable, high molecular weight form of the HIV gp41 ectodomain in the brains of HIV-infected individuals may provide a rational explanation for the origin of HIV-associated neurological damage and dementia, which is consistent with known mechanisms of encephalopathy. The HIV and SIV e-gp41 constructs employed are those described in Ref. 18.Wingfield P.T. Stahl S.J. Kaufman J. Zlotinick A. Hyde C.C. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1653-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, specifically residues 27–154 for HIV (strain HXB2) gp41 and residues 27–149 for SIV (strain Mac239) gp41 (using the numbering scheme from Ref. 18.Wingfield P.T.

Size exclusion chromatography of e-gp41 (200–300 μg) under various experimental conditions of buffer, pH, and denaturant (urea or guanidinium chloride) was carried out on a Superdex-200 column (1 × 30 cm; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 0.7 ml/min (Åkta explorer, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protease reactions were performed in 100 μl of 0.1 m NaHCO3, pH 8.0, containing 30 μg of purified e-gp41 aggregate and 0.3 μg of trypsin for 1 h at 37 °C. CD spectra were recorded on a JASCO J-720 spectropolarimeter using a 0.01-cm path length cell and 23 μm protein (monomer units) in 0.1 mNaHCO3, pH 8.0. Mass analysis of proteolytic digests was carried out by injecting protein (50–100 pmol) into a Zorbax C3 column (2.3 x 150 mm, Hewlett Packard, San Jose, CA) fitted to an HP1100 integrated high pressure liquid chromatography/electrospray mass spectrometer (Hewlett Packard) equilibrated in 5% acetic acid. The solvent was held isocratic for 25 min to allow desalting of the protein and then ramped to 100% acetonitrile over a period of 25 min at a flow rate of 200 μl/min. Protein peaks that eluted into the mass spectrometer were scanned from m/z 500 to 1700 every 4 s. Spectra were deconvoluted using the Hewlett Packard software to yield the mass of the protein. Samples of SIV e-gp41 trimers or aggregate were examined by negative stain transmission EM. Samples (50 μg/ml) were applied to air glow-discharged carbon-coated grids and stained with 1% uranyl acetate. Micrographs were recorded at ×30,000 magnification with a Zeiss EM902 (Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Some samples were also stained with methylamine vanadate and examined by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) (25.Hainfield, J. F., Safer, D., Wall, J. S., Simon, M., Li, B. & Powell, R. D. (1994) in Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Meeting of the Microscopic Society of America (Bailey, G. W., and Garrat-Reed, A. D., eds.) pp. 132–133, San FranciscoGoogle Scholar). Mass determinations of e-gp41 aggregate particles were made from micrographs of freeze-dried specimens obtained at the Brookhaven National Laboratory STEM facility (26.Thomas D. Schultz P. Steven A.C. Wall J.S. Biol. Cell. 1994; 80: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Briefly, specimens were applied to prewetted thin carbon films (2–3 mm thick) supported on holey thick carbon films on titanium grids. Specimens were then rinsed repeatedly with 20 mm ammonium acetate, blotted to a thin film between two pieces of filter paper, and plunged into liquid nitrogen slush. Specimens were freeze-dried by gradual warming to −80 °C under high vacuum and then transferred under vacuum to the STEM. Images were recorded at 40 keV and an electron dose of ≪1000 electrons/nm2 at −150 °C to minimize radiation damage. Tobacco mosaic virus particles (131.4 kDa/nm) included in the preparations served as a mass standard, and mass determinations were done with the software described in Ref. 27.Wall J.S. Hainfield J.F. Simon M.N. Berrios M. Methods in Cell Biology. 53. Academic Press, New York1998: 139-166Google Scholar. The autopsy records of the National Institutes of Health from 1985 to 1998 were examined to identify appropriate material for a limited re-examination of the neuropatology of HAD. The histology and immunochemistry of brain lesions in HAD are well described, and therefore one case from each of the following groups was chosen: a patient with AIDS, clinical dementia, and histological evidence of HAD complex; a patient with AIDS but without clinical dementia and no histological evidence of HAD complex; and a patient without AIDS, clinical dementia, or histological evidence of HAD complex. Tissue was fixed in 10% buffered formalin for two weeks, sectioned, and embedded in paraffin. Serial 5-μm sections of blocks from the deep white matter were cut, and representative sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and examined for histology consistent with HAD. Mouse monoclonal antibody to gp41 (gp41.1, Genetic systems, Seattle, Washington) was employed to screen brain sections for the presence of gp41 at a 1:200 dilution using a Ventana Medical Systems Gen II (Tuczon, AZ) for detection. Positive and negative controls on tonsilar lymphoid tissue from non-HIV-infected individuals were performed withl-26 (positive control) and gp41 (negative control) monoclonal antibodies. For EM studies, tissue sections corresponding to histological lesions of HAD complex were removed from a paraffin block, deparaffinated in xylene, placed in absolute ethanol, and embedded in LR White (SPI, West Chester, PA). Ultrathin sections were mounted on 150 mesh-uncoated nickle grids. Grids were floated on blocking solution (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.5% cold water fish gelatin) for 20 min, incubated for 1 h with the primary anti-gp41 antibody (as described above), rinsed in blocking buffer for 5 min, then incubated with gold-conjugated secondary antibody 20 nm in length (Ted Pella, Inc., Redding, CA), rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, water, and air dried. Section were stained with uranyl acetate and examined with a Phillips CM10 electron microscope. At pH 2.5, size exclusion chromatography shows that both HIV and SIV e-gp41 elute as a single peak corresponding to the trimeric form solved by NMR spectroscopy (10.Adamson D.C. Wildemann B. Sasaki M. Glass J.D. McArthur J.C. Chritov V.I. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 1996; 274: 1917-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) with a molecular mass of about 45 kDa (Fig. 1 A). During the course of our biochemical characterization of HIV and SIV e-gp41 we noted that both nonglycosylated ectodomains are remarkably soluble with no visible precipitation in 0.1 m NaHCO3 at pH 8. Under these conditions, both ectodomains elute as two forms, a high molecular weight form with an apparent molecular mass of about 600 kDa and the trimeric form (Fig. 1 B). The proportion of the two forms can be altered by pH and urea. The trimeric form is favored at low pH, whereas the high molecular weight form is predominant at neutral pH. Both forms coexist about equally in 1 m urea. In 8 m urea, the ratio of high molecular weight to trimeric form is about 1:2 for the SIV e-gp41, and only the trimeric form is present in the case of the HIV e-gp41. Although the two forms are obviously in equilibrium, kinetic exchange between the two forms is imperceptibly slow. Thus, the purified soluble high molecular weight form of SIV e-gp41 elutes as only a single peak on size-exclusion chromatography (Fig. 2 A) and is stable for over a week.Figure 2Digestion of the purified high molecular weight form of the ectodomain of SIV gp41 with trypsin and mapping of cleavage products.

Stahl S.J. Kaufman J. Zlotinick A. Hyde C.C. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1653-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, the tertiary structure remains unchanged upon formation of the high molecular weight form. To ascertain the mechanism of aggregation we subjected the purified high molecular weight form of SIV e-gp41 to trypsin digestion in 0.1 mNaHCO3, pH 8. The elution profiles demonstrate that trypsin converts the high molecular weight form to the trimeric form (Fig.2 A). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shows that the full-length SIV e-gp41 (Fig. 2 B, lane 1) is cleaved to a distinct smaller molecular weight product (lane 2, band P1) and a less distinct product (lane 2, band P2) that migrates just below the major product. The nearly equal intensity of the major band (lane 2, band P1) observed upon cleavage relative to that of the full-length polypeptide (lane 1) suggests that the two products of cleavage co-migrate in the same position. To confirm this observation and to map the sites of cleavage, a sample similar in composition to that in lane 2 of Fig. 2 B was subjected to liquid chromatography-electrospray mass spectrometry. Two distinct peaks withm/z 7235 and 7199 indicated one major cleavage site in the polypeptide spanning residues 1–63 and 64–123. This major cleavage site between Arg63 and Gln64 is located at the tip of the loop that connects the N- and C-terminal helices of the ectodomain core (Fig. 2 C). The minor P2 band (m/z5369) corresponds to a secondary cleavage site between residues Lys80 and Trp81 of the C-terminal fragment (residues 64–123). This cleavage site is located at the N-terminal end of the C-terminal helix (Fig. 2 C). The second product resulting from the minor cleavage was also detected with m/z1847, corresponding to residues 64–80. These results suggest that the integrity of the loop that connects the N- and C-terminal helices of the ectodomain core is essential for e-gp41 aggregation. The same pattern of digestion was also observed with the HIV e-gp41 ectodomain as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown). To further characterize the high molecular weight form of the gp41 ectodomain we carried out both conventional transmission electron microscopy (CTEM) and STEM. CTEM of negatively stained, purified high molecular weight form of gp41 (Fig. 3 B) reveals aggregates that are heterogeneous in size and shape, although one dimension (the diameter in the case of globular particles, the width in the case of more elongated particles) is usually about 150–200 Å. In contrast, trimer preparations (Fig. 3 A) show much smaller particles, including rodlets ∼30 × 100 Å that are likely to represent side views of individual trimers. To some extent, the variability in appearance of the aggregates may represent different viewing angles. A quantitative measure of their heterogeneity is obtained from dark field STEM of unstained, freeze-dried specimens (Fig. 3 C) (26.Thomas D. Schultz P. Steven A.C. Wall J.S. Biol. Cell. 1994; 80: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27.Wall J.S. Hainfield J.F. Simon M.N. Berrios M. Methods in Cell Biology. 53. Academic Press, New York1998: 139-166Google Scholar). In these digital micrographs, the number of scattered electrons in each pixel is directly proportional to the mass thickness. By summing over all pixels of an aggregate (and subtracting the substrate background), the mass of each aggregate can be determined, regardless of its orientation (26.Thomas D. Schultz P. Steven A.C. Wall J.S. Biol. Cell. 1994; 80: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 27.Wall J.S. Hainfield J.F. Simon M.N. Berrios M. Methods in Cell Biology. 53. Academic Press, New York1998: 139-166Google Scholar). These data (Fig.1 C) show a broad distribution of masses ranging from ∼300 kDa to >3000 kDa, peaking at ∼ 650 kDa, with a mean of 1033 kDa. Because the experimental uncertainty in a single measurement for a particle of this molecular weight range is expected to be of the order of 2–5% (27.Wall J.S. Hainfield J.F. Simon M.N. Berrios M. Methods in Cell Biology. 53. Academic Press, New York1998: 139-166Google Scholar), the heterogeneity is clearly real. It follows that the high molecular weight aggregates contain from ∼7 to >70 trimers. Dark field STEM micrographs of molecules embedded in a low density negative stain such as vanadate (25.Hainfield, J. F., Safer, D., Wall, J. S., Simon, M., Li, B. & Powell, R. D. (1994) in Proceedings of the 52nd Annual Meeting of the Microscopic Society of America (Bailey, G. W., and Garrat-Reed, A. D., eds.) pp. 132–133, San FranciscoGoogle Scholar) provide a sensitive method for detecting fine details because maximum contrast in these images is achieved when the beam is optimally focused. With bright field CTEM, on the other hand, contrast is augmented by appropriate defocusing but at the expense of interference effects that may obscure fine details. A high magnification STEM micrograph of vanadate-stained gp41 aggregates is shown in Fig. 3 D. Their dimensions are consistent with those in the CTEM (Fig. 3 B). In these images, however, finger-like protrusions are frequently visible, extending at variable angles at the periphery of these particles (e.g. Fig.3 D, arrowheads). The width of these fingers is ∼35Å, the diameter of a gp41 trimer. Taken together the biochemical and EM observations imply that the aggregates consist of variable numbers (typically 7–70) of gp41 trimers, associated by means of interactions among their connecting loops at the interior of the aggregate. A model for the e-gp41 aggregate is presented in Fig. 4. The packing arrangement is not very regular, but the trimers are predominantly oriented with their long axes oriented radially, a property that explains the finger-like protuberances, as well as the characteristic dimension of 150–200 Å as two molecular lengths. The severity and degree of dementia in HAD has been correlated to total gp41 levels in the brain, as determined using protein immunoblots (10.Adamson D.C. Wildemann B. Sasaki M. Glass J.D.

The unique ability of e-gp41 to form stable high molecular weight aggregates provides an explanation for the longevity and immunogenicity of gp41 over other HIV proteins. In addition, extracellular aggregates of e-gp41 would be phagocytosed by brain macrophages and possibly astrocytes and would have the potential to induce the elaboration of cytokines as has been documented by several laboratories (35.Merrill J.E. Koyanagi Y. Zack J. Thomas L. Martin F. Chen I.S.Y. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 2217-2225Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Lane T.E. Buchmeier M.J. Watry D.D. Fox H.S. Mol.

Med. 1995; 182: 941-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We therefore propose that the neurotoxicity of gp41 is related to the biophysical properties of e-gp41, namely its ability to self-associate into folded, stable, high molecular weight aggregates. The histological appearance of the high molecular weight form of gp41 would be difficult to observe by standard methods. For example, Congo Red staining, which stains β amyloid, would not be expected to stain a helical polymer. However, routine immunohistochemistry can highlight the presence of gp41 and has the ability to distinguish between membranous and nonmembranous protein localization. Immunostaining of brain sections in patients with HAD reveals numerous gp41 positive perivascular macrophages (Fig. 5 A), confirming previous observations (12.Kure K. Llena J.F. Lyman W.D. Soeiro R. Weidenheim K.M. Hirano H. Dickson D.W. Hum. Pathol. 1991; 22: 700-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 13.Rostasy K. Monti L. Yiannoutsos C. Kneissel M. Bell J. Kamper T.L. Hedreen J.C. Navia B.A. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 46: 207-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 38.Budka H. Gray F. Gray F. Atlas of Neuropathology of HIV Infection. Oxford University Press, Oxford1993: 1-46Google Scholar). In addition, the staining pattern is strongly suggestive of extracellular gp41 (inset in Fig. 5 A). In contrast no evidence of immunoperoxidase staining for gp41 is observed in sections of brains from patients without HAD (Fig. 5 B). The presence of extracellular gp41 in the brains of HAD individuals was confirmed by EM combined with histoimmunochemistry using a gold-labeled secondary antibody that clearly localizes gp41 to sites such as adventitial (perivascular) collagen (Fig. 5 C). Extracellular gp41 visualized by immunohistochemistry of HAD brains may represent extracellular viral particles or free aggregates of gp41. Because the severity and extent of HAD is correlated with gp41 and not viral load, it is very likely that the visualized extracellular gp41 represents high molecular weight aggregates of e-gp41. At present there is no known explanation for gp41 neurotoxicity that results in HIV-associated neurological damage and dementia. Our biochemical results clearly demonstrate that HIV and SIV e-gp41 forms high molecular weight aggregates at physiological pH. Whereas the core of HIV and SIV e-gp41 is resistant to proteolysis and denaturation (14.Lu M. Blacklow S. Kim P.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 1075-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar,18.Wingfield P.T. Stahl S.J. Kaufman J. Zlotinick A. Hyde C.C. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 1653-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), the regions N- and C-terminal to the ectodomain are sensitive to proteolysis. These observations lead us to speculate that in HIV-infected patients e-gp41 accumulates in the brain as a stable extracellular aggregate. We therefore propose the following molecular model for the role of gp41 in neurological damage and dementia. In the native state, e-gp41 is present on the exterior of both virus particles and infected cells and is anchored to the membrane by its C-terminal transmembrane region. The action of proteolytic enzymes within the brain could readily result in the release of e-gp41 into the extracellular matrix. Because of the biochemical properties of e-gp41, it would then form a high molecular weight aggregate at physiological pH, and it is the accumulation of these high molecular weight aggregates that lead to neurological damage and the subsequent clinical findings of dementia. If aggregation of e-gp41 is responsible for HAD, one would expect to find histologic similarities between cerebral HIV lesions and cerebral lesions induced by other protein deposition disorders. Indeed, a spongiform encephalopathy morphologically indistinguishable from Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has been reported in some cases of HAD (39.Schwenk J. Cruz-Sanchez F. Gosztonyi G. Covos-Navaro J. Acta Neuropath. 1987; 74 (292): 389Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar,40.Artigas J. Niedobitek F. Grosse G. Heise W. Gosztonyi G. J. Acquired Immune Defic. Syndr. 1989; 2: 374-381PubMed Google Scholar). The etiology of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is generally considered to arise from the accumulation of plaques comprising a modified prion protein, which forms a protein polymer with a high β sheet content (41.Prusiner S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5099) Google Scholar). An analogous pathogenesis for HAD, involving high molecular weight aggregates of e-gp41, can be entertained in light of the data for gp41 presented above. Of greater significance is the observation that the pathogneumonic lesion in HIV encephalopathy shares pathological, radiological, and clinical features with Binswanger's disease. In both diseases the histologic picture is diffuse demyelination of the periventricular white matter, ventricular dilation, and astrocytic gliosis (rarefaction). The computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging patterns are nearly identical, areas of periventicular hypodensity on computer tomography, which appear as bright areas of increased intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging images (leukoariosis) (42.Ortiz J.S. Knight P.V. Age Ageing. 1994; 23: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 43.Osborn A.G. Patterson A.S. Diagnostic Neuroradiology. Mosby, St. Louis, MO1999: 698-699Google Scholar). Clinically, HAD is diagnosed from the acquisition of abnormalities in three areas, cognitive abilities, motor function, and social/emotional behavior (44.American Academy of Neurology AIDS Task ForceNeurology. 1991; 41: 778-785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, Binswanger's disease is often described as the acute or gradual onset of deficits in these three areas (45.Wallin A. Blenow K. J. Geriatr. Psych. Neurol. 1993; 6: 177-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Another vascular abnormality with an identical morphology to Binswanger's disease has been reported in some cases of Alzheimer's disease exhibiting amyloid deposition (46.Brun A. Englund E. Ann. Neurol. 1986; 19: 253-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar), and a common mechanism of hypoperfusion of the deep penetrating medullary arteries from either atherosclerosis in Binswanger's disease or amyloid deposition in Alzheimer's disease has been proposed (42.Ortiz J.S. Knight P.V. Age Ageing. 1994; 23: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 43.Osborn A.G. Patterson A.S. Diagnostic Neuroradiology. Mosby, St. Louis, MO1999: 698-699Google Scholar, 44.American Academy of Neurology AIDS Task ForceNeurology. 1991; 41: 778-785Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Such hypoperfusion would be most apparent in the periventricular deep white matter, which has limited collateral perfusion. Hypoperfusion leading to ischemia has been linked to an increase in nitric-oxide synthase (47.Heinert G. Nye P.C.G. Paterson D.J. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1999; 166: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and nitric-oxide synthase-generated NO is thought to be a major mediator of gp41 toxicity (10.Adamson D.C. Wildemann B. Sasaki M. Glass J.D. McArthur J.C. Chritov V.I. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Science. 1996; 274: 1917-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 11.Adamson D.C. McArthur J.C. Dawson T.M. Dawson V.L. Mol. Med. 1999; 5: 98-109Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is well established that free radicals generated from the ischemic processes may combine with NO to form toxic NO derivatives capable of damaging cells in a variety of ways (48.Cotran R.S. Kumar V. Robbins S.L. Schoen F.J. Pathological Basis of Disease. Saunders, Philadelphia1994Google Scholar). Based on the above known mechanisms and histology of encephalopathy, periventricular white matter hypoperfusion from gp41 deposition in the artery walls is another likely mechanism for HAD. A final consideration is that HIV gp41 is currently being considered as an immunogen either in the form of injected protein, pox virus-expressing protein, or a DNA vaccine (49.Evans T.G. Keefer M.C. Weinhold K.J. Wolff M. Montefiori D. Gorse G.J. Graham B.S. McElrath M.J. Clements-Mann M.L. Mulligan M.J. Fast P. Walker M.C. Excler J.L. Dubliege A.M. Tartaglia J. J. Infect. Dis. 1999; 180: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 50.Letvin N.L. Montefiori D.C. Yasutomi Y. Perry H.C. Davies M.-E. Lekutis C. Alroy M. Freed D.C. Lord C.I. Handt L.K. Liu M.A. Shiver J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9378-9383Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). The observation that the gp41 ectodomain accumulates as a possibly neurotoxic aggregate in the brain suggests that the use of gp41 as an immunogen should be employed with caution. It is also possible that a peptide mapping to the loop region (residues 64–80) may be a useful immunogen for delaying or preventing the onset of HAD, in a manner analogous to the attenuation of Alzheimer disease-like pathology in a mouse model by immunization with amyloid-β peptide (51.Schenk D. Barbour R. Dunn W. Gordon G. Grajeda H. Guido T. Hu K. Huang J. Johnson-Wood K. Khan K. Kholodenko D. Lee M. Liao Z.M. Liederburg I. Motter R. Multer L. Soriano F. Shopp G. Vasquez N. Vanderwert C. Walker S. Wogulis M. Yednok T. Games D. Seubert P. Nature. 1999; 400: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (2929) Google Scholar). Finally, the retroviridae used in gene therapy require the action of an envelope protein analogous to gp41 (52.Yang S. Delgado R. King S.R. Woffendin C. Barker C.S. Yang Z.-Y. Xu L. Nolan G.P. Nabel G.J. Hum. Gene Ther. 1999; 10: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The present study suggests that the solubility and stability properties of the viral envelope proteins should be taken into consideration in the design of retroviral gene therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2044631581,"We used single channel methods on A6 renal cells to study the regulation by methylation reactions of epithelial sodium channels. 3-Deazaadenosine (3-DZA), a methyltransferase blocker, produced a 5-fold decrease in sodium transport and a 6-fold decrease in apical sodium channel activity by decreasing channel open probability (P o). 3-Deazaadenosine also blocked the increase in channel open probability associated with addition of aldosterone. Sodium channel activity in excised “inside-out” patches usually decreased within 1–2 min; in the presence ofS-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet), activity persisted for 5–8 min. Sodium channel mean time open (t open) before and after patch excision was higher in the presence of AdoMet than in untreated excised patches but less than t open in cell-attached patches. Sodium channel activity in excised patches exposed to both AdoMet and GTP usually remained stable for more than 10 min, andP o and the number of active channels per patch were close to values in cell-attached patches from untreated cells. These findings suggest that a methylation reaction contributes to the activity of epithelial sodium channels in A6 cells and is directed to some regulatory element closely connected with the channel, whose activity also depends on the presence of intracellular GTP.

The cell line, A6, derived from distal tubules of Xenopus laevis nephrons, is a good experimental model for the study of these sodium channels. When grown on permeable supports in the presence of aldosterone, A6 cells express an apical sodium channel with properties identical to those of channels in mammalian tissues (1.Palmer L.G. Frindt G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2767-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Despite many studies, the mechanism by which aldosterone stimulates apical sodium transport is still poorly understood. It is known that the complex between aldosterone and its intracellular receptor activates gene expression and induces the synthesis of proteins (2.Blazer-Yost B. Geheb M. Preston A. Handler J. Cox M.

Originally, because of the observation that protein synthesis was required for aldosterone to increase sodium transport, it was postulated that aldosterone induced sodium channel synthesis and insertion. However, earlier studies in A6 cells showed that aldosterone increases Na+ entry at the apical membrane by changing the activity of channels that are already present in the apical membrane and not by increasing the number of channels (13.Kemendy A.E. Kleyman T.R. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C825-C837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although interpretation of other electrophysiological data remains controversial (14.Pacha J. Frindt G. Antonian L. Silver R.B. Palmer L.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1993; 102: 25-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 15.Baxendale L.M. Duncan R.L. Helman S.I. Fed.

Biol. 1982; 64: 91-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), biochemical methods support the original observation that ENaC mRNA and ENaC protein in the apical membrane does not increase in the presence of aldosterone (at least in the first 2–4 h when the increase in sodium transport is most dramatic) (10.Garty H. Edelman I.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 81: 785-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar,17.Middleton P. Al-Khalili O.K. Zuckerman J.B. Rokaw M.D. Johnson J.P. Eaton D.C.

Since the action of aldosterone appears to involve a mechanism that increases the P o of sodium channels, an examination of post-translational mechanisms that alterP o may offer some insight into the mechanism of aldosterone action, but identifying signal transduction pathways that can increase sodium channel P o in A6 cells has been difficult. There have been many suggestions about potential aldosterone-induced post-translational modifications, but in the context of our previous results (20.Stockand J.D. Edinger R.S. Al-Baldawi N.F. Wang J.M. Johnson J.P. Eaton D.C. FASEB J. 1999; 13 (A67): A67Google Scholar, 21.Stockand J.D. Spier B.J. Worrell R.T. Yue G. Al-Baldawi N. Eaton D.C. J. Biol.

FASEB J. 1994; 8: 339Google Scholar), one is particularly interesting. Sariban-Sohraby et al. (23.Sariban-Sohraby S. Burg M. Wiesmann W.P. Chiang P.K. Johnson J.P. Science. 1984; 225: 745-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the amount of sodium transport that could be measured in apical membrane vesicles obtained from A6 cells, a sodium-transporting, distal-nephron cell line, was markedly enhanced by prior application of agents that methylate membrane proteins. There was no additional effect of AdoMet in the presence of aldosterone, and the effect was blocked by two methylation blockers, S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) and 3-deazaadenosine (3-DZA). 3-DZA is a membrane-permeable drug that blocks transmethylation reactions by specifically inhibiting theS-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase, thereby promoting the accumulation of S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) and deaza-d-adenosylhomocysteine that produces end product inhibition of AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases (24.Zimmerman T.P. Wolberg G. Duncan G.S. Elion G.B. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2252-2259Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Since they also demonstrated that application of aldosterone leads to the methylation of membrane protein and lipid, their suggestion was that intracellular methyltransferases induced by aldosterone could be responsible for the methylation and, therefore, modulate the sodium channel protein. As a post-translational modification, methylation is analogous to phosphorylation (for reviews see Refs. 25.Chiang P.K. Gordon R.K. Tal J. Zeng G.C. Doctor B.P. Pardhasaradhi K. McCann P.P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 471-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 26.Aswad D.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 1182-1187Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 27.Rando R.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1300: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 28.Volker C. Stock J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 255: 65-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Highly specific methyltransferases promote the methylation of proteins at specific consensus sites, and much less specific esterases promote demethylation of the proteins. The difference between phosphorylation and methylation is that methylation is in general more stable and, therefore, can be used to alter the activity of proteins for a much longer period than is typical for phosphorylation. The previous work on methylation implies an involvement of transmethylation in controlling sodium transport; however, the studies all involved measuring changes in total sodium transport and therefore do not distinguish between the relative contribution of channel density, single-channel open probability, and conductance. In principle, any of these factors could contribute to a modification of transepithelial transport. These considerations led us to study the effects of carboxymethylation reactions on the activity of single-sodium channels of A6 cells using patch clamp methods. In this way, we hoped to clarify what aspect of channel function is altered and to confirm whether the methylation effect is indeed membrane-directed. We found that methylation inhibitors reduce ENaC activity by decreasingP o. Also, addition of the methyl donor, AdoMet, to the cytosolic surface of ENaC in excised inside-out patches significantly increased channel activity with respect to controls. The presence of AdoMet seems to maintain the single channel mean open time even after excision. Addition of partially purified methyltransferase produced little additional effect, suggesting that the endogenous methyltransferase is probably membrane-associated and close to the channel. Addition of GTP along with AdoMet increased channel activity more than AdoMet alone. The present work has been previously reported in several brief communications (13.Kemendy A.E. Kleyman T.R. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C825-C837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Becchetti A. Sariban-Sohraby S. Eaton D.C. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 339Google Scholar). For single channel experiments, we used A6 cells from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) in the 68th passage. Experiments were carried out on passages 70–80, with no discernible variation between cells from different passages. Cells were maintained in plastic tissue culture flasks (Corning, NY) at 26 °C in a humidified incubator with 4% CO2 in air. The culture medium was a mixture of Coon's medium F-12 (3 parts) and Leibovitz's medium l-15 (7 parts) modified for amphibian cells with 104 mm NaCl, 25 mmNaHCO3, pH 7.4, with a final osmolarity of 240 mosmol/kg H2O. Besides these components, 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Irvine Scientific, CA), 1% streptomycin, and 0.6% penicillin (Hazleton Biologics, KA) and, in most experiments, 1 μmaldosterone were added. Cells grown on plastic tissue culture dishes were detached when confluent by exposing them to divalent-free (Ca2+ and Mg2+) medium containing 0.05% trypsin and 0.6 mm EDTA (Irvine Scientific, CA). The cells were then rinsed, centrifuged, resuspended, and finally replated. When used for patch clamp experiments, A6 cells were replated at confluent density on collagen-coated, permeable CM® filters (Millipore) attached to the bottom of small Lucite disks with the disks suspended in 35-mm Petri plates as described previously (29.Marunaka Y. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1071-C1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This sided preparation forms a polarized monolayer with the apical surface oriented upward and net sodium transport moving from the apical to basolateral surface. The cells were fed with fresh medium every 2 days and sampled when fully differentiated (7–14 days after replating). For experiments in which the aldosterone levels were reduced, after the cells reached confluent density, the cells were incubated in medium free of both aldosterone and serum for 2 days. Then half of the cells were washed with A6 saline and re-fed with serum-free medium containing 1.5 μm aldosterone. The remaining cells (aldosterone-free controls) were washed with A6 saline followed by re-addition of aldosterone-free and serum-free medium. Cells were incubated for 4 h followed by current or patch clamp measurements. Protein carboxymethyltransferase was partially purified from the membrane fraction of A6 cells as one of us has described previously (30.Ismailov I.I. McDuffie J.H. Sariban-Sohraby S. Johnson J.P. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22193-22197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Medium was removed, and cells were washed twice in a Ringer's solution (85 mm NaCl, 18 mm NaHCO3, 4 mm KCI, 1 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4), scraped, and Dounce-homogenized. Crude membrane and cytosolic fractions were separated by centrifugation at 50,000 ×g for 1 h. Stripped membranes were prepared by a modification of the method of Yamane and Fung (31.Yamane H.K. Fung B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20100-20105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane pellet was resuspended in Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol) along with 1% sodium cholate and allowed to sit on ice for 1 h. The membranes were collected by centrifugation as above, washed twice, and resuspended in Buffer A without sodium cholate. The enzyme activity assay was similar to that described previously (32.Ghosh S.K. Paik W.K. Kim S. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 19024-19033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,33.Lobet Y. Lhoest J. Colson C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 997: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In brief, 50 μg of protein of the enzyme preparation was incubated with the incubation mixture (50 μl) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8, 720 nm[3H]adenosylmethionine (15 Ci/mmol), 100 μmof the methyltransferase substrate,N-acetyl-S-farnesyl-l-cysteine, and a blocking concentration of a methyltransferase inhibitor when appropriate (S-trans,trans-farnesylthiosalicylic acid, 3-deazadenosine, or S-adenosylhomocysteine). After incubation for 1 h at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by the addition of 50 μl of 20% trichloroacetic acid and the reaction mix vortexed for 10 s. The isoprenyl cysteine methyl esters were separated by the addition of 400 μl of heptane to the reaction mix. A fraction (200 μl) of the organic top layer containing the methyl esters was transferred to a small top-free Eppendorf tube and dried under vacuum. 200 μl of 1 m NaOH was added, and the tube was placed upright in a vial containing a small volume of scintillation fluid. The vials were sealed and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The strong base hydrolyzes the methyl esters releasing methanol vapor that partitions into the hydrophobic scintillant. The methyl esters in the vials were counted by liquid scintillation counting. The specific activity of the enzyme is defined as picomoles of methyl-3H group transferred per mg/min of enzyme protein. The preparation catalyzed the incorporation of base-labile isotope intoN-acetyl-S-farnesyl-l-cysteine, which was 70–90% inhibited by AdoHcy or FTS. The specific activity of methyl groups transformed by the enzyme was 0.12 pmol/mg protein/min. A6 cells were grown for 14 days on permeable supports with a surface area of approximately 9 cm2, at which time transepithelial potential differences (PD) and resistances (R) were measured using dual flexible electrodes, containing Ag/AgCl pellets (Millicell-ERS, Millipore, Bedford MA). The resistance of the insert was obtained by passing an alternating current of ± 20 μA at 12.5 Hz. Transepithelial current (I tr) was calculated from the PD and R values, and in this system, the predominant component of the current is carried by Na+ through amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels at the apical membrane (34.Baxendale-Cox L.M. Duncan R.L. Liu X. Baldwin K. Els W.J. Helman S.I. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1650-C1656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because measurements were made under sterile conditions, we were able to make several measurements over time on the same cells. We used either the cell-attached or the inside-out configuration of the Hamill patch clamp technique. Before sampling, the apical cell surface was carefully washed several times with our standard extracellular solution, containing (in mm): 95 NaCl, 3.4 KCl, 0.8 CaCl2, 0.8 MgCl2, 10 HEPES (Sigma); pH was adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH. Patch pipettes contained the same solution. For inside-out experiments, the apical solution was substituted immediately before patch excision with a cytosol-mimicking solution (in mm: 85 KCl, 3 NaCl, 4 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 5 EGTA, potassium salt (Sigma), 1 mm adenosine trisphosphate (ATP, sodium salt, Sigma), and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, adjusted with KOH). Only one inside-out experiment was performed per dish to avoid any possibility of examining cells whose properties might have been altered by extended exposure to high potassium solution. In some of the inside-out experiments, 300 μm S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet, Sigma) or GTP was added to the “intracellular” solution. Solutions containing AdoMet, GTP, or ATP were prepared fresh every day to prevent possible degradation. All experiments were performed at room temperature (22–24 °C, very close to the physiological temperature for amphibian cells) within 45–60 min of removing the A6 cells from the incubator. Patch pipettes with a tip diameter ≤1 μmwere fabricated from WPI TW 150 glass (New Haven, CT) and fire-polished. Since the voltage dependence of apical sodium channels in A6 cells is relatively small (35.Palmer L.G. Frindt G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1988; 92: 121-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), we have not corrected all our data for the small (a few mV) junction potential present after patch excision in a high potassium solution. Single channel currents from cell-attached patches were measured with an Axopatch 1-B current-voltage clamp amplifier (Axon Instruments, Inc. Burlingame, CA), low pass-filtered at 5 kHz, and recorded on a digital video recorder (Sony, Japan), and then the recorded signal was refiltered and digitized at twice the corner frequency (usually 1 kHz) using a Scientific Solutions A/D converter and an IBM PC computer equipped with Axotape software (Axon Instruments, CA). The data were subsequently transferred to a Micro Vax II computer (Digital Equipment) for single channel analysis. Data records from cells grown in the presence of aldosterone were low pass-filtered at 100 Hz, whereas those from aldosterone-depleted cells were filtered at 300 or 500 Hz using a software Gaussian filter. Events were detected by setting the threshold level at 50% of the estimated single channel current amplitude. Because of the necessity for analyzing long continuous records, programs that closely follow the strategy of Colquhoun and Sigworth (36.Colquhoun D. Sigworth F.J. Sakmann B. Neher E. Fitting and Statistical Analysis of Single Channel Records. Plenum Press, New York1983: 191-263Google Scholar) were written for use on the VAX family of computers. These programs produce tables of event durations and amplitudes based on a 50% threshold crossing algorithm and allowed the analysis of long continuous records, necessary for the interpretation of single channel experiments on renal epithelial tissue. One method for calculating NP o from single channel records without making any assumptions about the total number of channels in a patch or the P o of a single channel is given by Equation 1, NPo=∑i=0NA itiTEquation 1 where T is the total recording time;N A is the observable number of current levels (corresponding to the apparent number of channels) within the patch determined as the highest observable current level; i is the number of channels open; and t i is the time during which i channels are open. If channels open independently of one another and the exact number of channels in a patch is known, then the P o of a single channel can be calculated by dividing NP o by the number of channels in a patch. The total number of functional channels (N) in the patch was determined by observing the number of peaks detected in all points amplitude histograms constructed, when possible, from event records of long enough duration to provide 95% confidence of determining the correct N according to methods we have previously described (37.Kemendy A.E. Kleyman T.R. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C825-C837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38.Marunaka Y. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1071-C1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, especially in some of the untreated excised patches, we could not record long enough to reach a 95% confidence level, and the values for N in these patches may be an underestimate. The mean open time (t o) of N channels can be calculated as shown in Equation 2, t0=TNPn/2=∑i=1NAitin/2Equation 2 where n is the total number of transitions between states during the total recording period, T, and the other parameters are the same as in Equation 1. This value represents the average time the channel spends open (in any open state) and should not be confused with the mean residency time of the channel in a specific state (sometimes called the mean open time for the state). Nonetheless, this measure provides an easy way to distinguish whether experimental manipulations (e.g. AdoMet or 3-DZA) modifyP o by affecting the open states or closed states of the channel. Unless otherwise stated, data are presented as the means ± S.E. Unpaired or paired Student's t tests as appropriate were used to test for significance between two treatments. Analysis of variance with Student-Neumann-Keuls post test was used for multiple comparisons. Probability <0.05 was considered significant. In this work, we have studied the highly selective, amiloride-blockable, aldosterone-inducible, 4-pS sodium channels previously observed in recordings from the apical surfaces of both A6 cells and isolated rat and rabbit cortical collecting tubule cells (1.Palmer L.G. Frindt G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2767-2770Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 39.Hamilton K.L. Eaton D.C. Membr.

An example of a typical recording from a patch containing three such channels is shown in Fig.1 A. In this case, the open probability measured from about 6 min of continuous recording at 0-mV pipette potential was close to 0.5 (see the amplitude histogram on the bottom). This is by far the most common type of channel found on the apical surface of A6 cells grown on permeable supports so that it can be studied in physiological solutions, i.e. without the need of any kind of ion channel blocker. Its biophysical properties have been extensively described by us and others (43.Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). If methylation is important for ENaC activity, inhibitors of methylation should reduce activity. A6 cells monolayers previously treated with aldosterone were pretreated for 2.5–5 h with 300 μm methylation inhibitor, 3-DZA for comparison with untreated cells. The patch activity was then recorded at 0 mV pipette potential (V p) for at least 4–5 min. Usually, this time was sufficiently long to estimate confidently the number of active channels (N) in a control patch in A6 cells (provided thatN ≤4–5 channels (38.Marunaka Y. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 260: C1071-C1084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 44.Kemendy A.E. Eaton D.C. FASEB J. 1989; 3 (abstr.): 861Google Scholar)). If N is known with confidence, P o can also be calculated. A representative example of a single channel record from a cell pretreated with 3-DZA for 3 h is shown in Fig. 1 B. A comparison of the amplitude histograms from Fig. 1, A andB, shows a dramatic difference in the open probability of sodium channels under the two conditions. The estimatedP o of channels in the 3-DZA-pretreated patch was less than 0.004, barely discernible in the amplitude histogram (for clarity, the bottom portion of the histogram has been magnified in theinset). This estimate of P o is an upper limit since it depends upon accurately determining the number of channels, N, in a patch. If we have underestimatedN, then we will overestimate P o. Therefore, P o may actually be significantly lower than 0.004. Our goals in this study were 2-fold as follows: first, to examine the regulation of sodium channel activity by methylation; and second, to determine if the action of aldosterone involved a methylation event as suggested by others (23.Sariban-Sohraby S. Burg M. Wiesmann W.P. Chiang P.K. Johnson J.P. Science. 1984; 225: 745-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 23.Sariban-Sohraby S. Burg M. Wiesmann W.P. Chiang P.K. Johnson J.P.

We had previously shown that one effect of aldosterone addition to aldosterone-depleted cells was to increase theP o of individual sodium channels from a very low level (less than 0.01) to a much higher level (about 0.4) (37.Kemendy A.E. Kleyman T.R. Eaton D.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: C825-C837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) primarily by increasing the mean open time of channels. To investigate further the relationship between methylation and the effects of aldosterone, we examined the effect of 3-DZA on single sodium channels in patches formed on aldosterone-depleted cells. First, paired dishes of A6 cells were serum- and aldosterone-depleted (see “Materials and Methods”) for 48 h before one dish was treated with 300 μm 3-DZA for 4 h. Then 1.5 μmaldosterone was added to both dishes, and sodium channel activity was sampled from both dishes by repeatedly forming patches on cells selected at random from the dishes. The results of a large number of experiments in which the patch activity was observed with or without 3-DZA incubation in the presence or absence of aldosterone are summarized in Fig. 2. A 3–4-h pretreatment with 3-DZA of aldosterone-treated cells dramatically decreased NP o from 2.88 ± 0.731 (mean ± S.D., n = 37) to 0.297 ± 0.185 (n = 49). These values contrast with theNP o determined in cells treated with aldosterone-free medium for 24 h of 0.117 ± 0.134 (n = 43). By dividing every NP ovalue by the maximum number of current levels detected during the whole recording period, we calculated that the sodium channelP o was significantly reduced by the action of 3-DZA (right) from 0.408 ± 0.0619 (n = 37) to 0.0808 ± 0.0314 (n = 49). TheP o after 3-DZA treatment was not significantly different than the P o in the absence of aldosterone (0.0902 ± 0.0289). The P oafter treatment with 3-DZA or aldosterone-free medium is an upper limit for the value of P o since, with low channel activity, it is possible that we underestimated the value forN, and thus we could have overestimatedP o. Nonetheless, even the upper limit forP o after 3-DZA treatment is significantly less than the P o of control channels. Unfortunately, although these data clearly suggest that 3-DZA decreases sodium channel P o, a concomitant effect on the channel density could not be completely ruled out. In controls, the mean number of channels (N) in patches showing detectable channel activity (37 patches) was 7.13 ± 1.70, withP o = 0.408 ± 0.0619. On the other hand, as mentioned above, the large decrease in mean P owe frequently observed after incubation with 3-DZA or in aldo"
https://openalex.org/W2041582506,"The sequence of a 228-amino acid nonspecific RNA binding domain appended to the N terminus of a eukaryote tRNA synthetase is shown here to have two lysine-rich clusters (LRCs) that are functionally significant in vivo and in vitro. These two LRCs have unrelated sequences and are separated by a spacer of over 100 amino acids. By using a sensitive test for function in vivo, each LRC is shown to be sufficient in the absence of the other. This sufficiency requires fusion of the spacer to either of the LRCs. Experiments in vitro confirmed that the LRCs are each important for RNA binding. Thus, this nonspecific RNA binding domain has two dissimilar lysine-rich sequence elements that are functionally redundant. Further experiments suggest that this redundancy is not used to dock two molecules of RNA but rather to enhance the overall affinity for a single RNA molecule.

Travers A.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 92-97Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 2.Pabo C.O. Sauer R.T. Annu. Rev.

These nonspecific interactions provide a framework upon which specific interactions are superimposed. The specific component adds sufficient incremental interactions to achieve fine discrimination between similar targets and generate a biological response in the appropriate concentration range. In the case of transactions involving transfer RNAs, the role of nonspecific RNA binding domains in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been demonstrated with the protein Arc1p (6.Simos G. Sauer A. Fasiolo F. Hurt E.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and with a particular domain of glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (7.Whelihan E.F. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2968-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8.Wang C.-C. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16508-16512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Arc1p has a C-terminal domain that exhibits nonspecific tRNA binding activity. A second domain enables Arc1p to dock onto glutamyl- and methionyl-tRNA synthetases and thereby bring a nonspecific tRNA binding domain to these proteins. In case of yeast methionyl-tRNA synthetase, the docking of Arc1p enhances the aminoacylation activity (6.Simos G. Sauer A. Fasiolo F. Hurt E.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Other experiments showed that an artificial fusion of the RNA-binding segment of Arc1p with an Escherichia coli tRNA synthetase achieved a similar effect (8.Wang C.-C. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16508-16512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Yeast glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase has an N-terminal appended domain (AdScQRS)1 of 228 amino acids that has RNA binding activity directed toward diverse sequences and structures including single-stranded oligoadenylic acid, unfractionated yeast tRNA, and an RNA pseudoknot (8.Wang C.-C. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16508-16512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Significantly, this activity imparts function in yeast on the heterologous E. coli enzyme that is normally inactive on yeast tRNA (7.Whelihan E.F. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2968-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In particular, fusion of AdScQRS to E. coliglutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (to give AdScQRS-EcQRS) yields a hybrid protein with appreciable aminoacylation activity in vitro using yeast tRNAGln as a substrate. This gain in specific aminoacylation activity is correlated with a gain in affinity for yeast tRNAGln (7.Whelihan E.F. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2968-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8.Wang C.-C. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16508-16512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, although EcQRS cannot sustain growth of a yeast strain with a knockout allele of the gene for cytoplasmic glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase, expression of the AdScQRS-EcQRS fusion protein rescues growth (7.Whelihan E.F. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2968-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8.Wang C.-C. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16508-16512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These experiments demonstrate a context in which the AdScQRSnonspecific RNA binding domain provides an essential function. Whether the appended domains seen in certain other yeast tRNA synthetases, glutamyl-, isoleucyl-, lysyl-, methionyl-, and valyl-tRNA synthetases (9.Mirande M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 95-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), also have nonspecific RNA binding activity is not yet known. Little is known about the protein determinants for nonspecific RNA binding in these systems or about how these determinants are organized in their respective sequences. Interestingly, AdScQRS and the appended domains of the aforementioned other yeast tRNA synthetases are lysine-rich (9.Mirande M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 95-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Because the positively charged lysine side chain is used for nonspecific phosphate backbone contacts in protein-nucleic acid complexes, we imagined that at least some of the lysine residues might be important for nonspecific RNA interactions. Interestingly, two lysine clusters at opposite ends of the sequence of AdScQRSstand out as obvious candidates for further investigation. With these considerations in mind, we set out to manipulate AdScQRS by deletion and point mutations and thereby study the consequencesin vivo and in vitro of these manipulations. To our surprise, this analysis demonstrated an unusual functional redundancy in the organization of structural elements needed for nonspecific RNA-binding interactions. This redundancy may have several implications for the design and evolution of proteins involved in transactions with RNA. An S. cerevisiae strain (EFW6) with a partial deletion of GLN4 was constructed as described previously (7.Whelihan E.F. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2968-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, an 835-base pair EcoRI fragment (encoding residues 384–662) of gln4 was deleted and replaced by TRP1, using standard genetic methods with aura3 − strain. The growth of EFW6gln4Δ::TRP1 strain was maintained by plasmid pEFW111 that contains GLN4 and the selectable markerURA3. The complementation assay was performed by introducing into EFW6 a second plasmid containing a test gene, such as an E. coli glnS derivative and LEU2 selectable marker and testing the ability of EFW6 to grow on 5-fluoroorotic acid (5-FOA) plates. The transformant evicts the maintenance plasmid with theURA3 marker in the presence of 5-FOA. Thus, only an enzyme with functional GlnRS encoded by the second plasmid (with theLEU2 marker) can rescue the growth defect. For constructing an AdScQRS-EcQRS fusion in a yeast shuttle vector, anNdeI-NdeI fragment containing the coding sequence for residues 1–228 of yeast cytoplasmic glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase was amplified from a plasmid clone that contains the entire sequence ofGLN4, the yeast gene for cytoplasmic glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (10.Ludmerer S. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10801-10806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This NdeI segment was subsequently cloned in-frame into the NdeI site at the start of the reading frame for E. coli glnS. (The coding sequence for the C terminus of E. coli glnS was tagged previously (7.Whelihan E.F. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2968-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) with a sequence encoding the 12CA5 epitope.) The resulting DNA containing the coding sequence for AdScQRS-EcQRS was subsequently used as a template for mutagenesis (11.Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). Polymerase chain reaction amplification and fusion of the NdeI-NdeI DNA segments encoding portions of AdScQRS to the coding region of E. coli glnS followed a similar approach to that for creating the Ad ScQRS -glnS fusion. Expression in yeast of E. coli glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase as well as the fusion proteins was monitored by immunoblotting with the anti-12CA5 antibody (12.Wilson I. Niman H. Houghten R. Cherenson A. Connolly M. Lerner R. Cell. 1984; 37: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). For purification of the wild-type, truncated, or mutated yeast AdScQRS, constructions were made in theE. coli expression vector pET-21b (Novagen, Madison, WI). Briefly, DNA fragments containing sequences encoding residues 1–228, 1–106, and 107–228 of GLN4 were polymerase chain reaction-amplified and cloned independently into theNdeI/XhoI site of pET-21b. The resulting DNA containing the full-length AdScQRS was subsequently used as a template for mutagenesis at Lys-19/Lys-20, Lys-188/Lys-189, or both. Standard protocols were used for expression and for purification of AdScQRS and the deletion and mutant proteins on a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity column (7.Whelihan E.F. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2968-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Protein-RNA interactions were assayed using affinity co-electrophoresis as described previously (13.Gale A.J. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8896-8903Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar,14.Cilley C.D. Williamson J.R. RNA (NY). 1997; 3: 57-67PubMed Google Scholar). The preparation of yeast tRNAGln (CUG) transcript was as described previously (7.Whelihan E.F. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2968-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The tRNAGln (CUG) transcript was labeled with 32P using polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), after dephosphorylation with calf intestine phosphatase (New England Biolabs). The purified AdScQRS-(1–228) (0.003–24 μm), truncated AdScQRS proteins (AdScQRS-(1–106) and AdScQRS-(107–228)) (0.01–72 μm), and AdScQRS mutant proteins (AdScQRS(K19A/K20A), AdScQRS(K188A/K189A), and AdScQRS(K19A/K20A/K188A/K189A)) (0.01–72 μm) were individually mixed with 5% polyacrylamide solution to prepare each minigel matrix. Radioactively labeled tRNAGln(CUG) was loaded at an estimated concentration of 1 nm in aliquots of 2 μl. Gels were run at 20 °C in a buffer (containing 45 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3 (room temperature), and 1 mm EDTA) with 50 mm NaCl at 50 V for 1 h. After electrophoresis, gels were dried and analyzed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Dissociation constants (K d) of the proteins and tRNAGln (CUG) transcript were determined as described previously (15.Lim W.A. Sauer R.T. Lander A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 196-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of the RNA-protein complex was determined as outlined by Morales et al. (16.Morales A.J. Swaijo M. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3475-3483Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed in a double-sectored Epon cell using an An60Ti rotor on a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge as described in Morales et al. (16.Morales A.J. Swaijo M. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3475-3483Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The preparation of yeast tRNAGln (CUG) transcript was as described previously, and tRNAfMet was purchased from Sigma. Protein (500 and 2000 nm) and tRNA (500 nm) samples (150 μl) were spun at 10,000–20,000 rpm at 20 °C. The samples were allowed to reach equilibrium for 12–24 h until successive scans were superimposable with no discernible difference between them. Data were then collected at every 0.005–0.01 cm to obtain an equilibrium scan. Equilibrium data were then analyzed by a non-linear least squares fit using a customized version of Origin Software version 3.78 (Microcal Software) provided by Beckman instruments as part of the XL-I package. The partial specific volume (v̄) used for tRNA was 0.53, and the calculated v̄ for the protein was 0.72 ml/g. The partial specific volume of the complex was calculated to be the weight average fraction of the two units (0.625 ml/g). The density of the buffer (50 mm Tris, 50 mm boric acid, and 5 mm MgCl2) was previously determined to be 1.0016 g/liter (15.Lim W.A. Sauer R.T. Lander A.D. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 196-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The molar extinction coefficient (ε) of AdScQRS at 280 nm was calculated using the program Sednterp (17.Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S. Rowe A. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar) as 19,940, whereas (ε) for tRNAfMet was estimated at 726,700 m−1·cm (17.Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S. Rowe A. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar). We took advantage of the previously described observation that E. coli glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase poorly acylates yeast tRNAGln and that the acylation deficiency can be corrected by fusion of AdScQRS to the N terminus of the E. coli enzyme. Interestingly, the S. cerevisiae and E. coli enzymes are close homologs, sharing 40% sequence identity over the entire length of the 551-amino acid sequence of the E. coli protein (Fig.1) (10.Ludmerer S. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10801-10806Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The greater length of the yeast synthetase (809 amino acids) is mostly due to the 228 amino acids of AdScQRS that are not present in E. coliglutaminyl-tRNA synthetase. Given the close similarity of the sequences of the main bodies of the enzymes, we imagined that many of the specific contacts between S. cerevisiae glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase and tRNAGln are also possible with the E. coli synthetase. However, the “fit” of S. cerevisiae tRNAGln on E. coliglutaminyl-tRNA synthetase is not sufficiently precise to ensure formation of an active complex. Thus, the demonstrated nonspecific RNA binding activity of AdScQRS provided sufficient stability so as to overcome subtle steric conflicts that might occur in the heterologous complex. Thirty-three lysines are present in the 228-amino acid sequence of AdScQRS. (In contrast, there are only 7 arginines.) The lysines are distributed throughout the sequence, but two regions show an unusual concentration. These regions are located near the N- and C-terminal ends, respectively, of AdScQRS (Fig. 1). The N-terminal cluster of 6 lysine residues is located between Lys-19 and Lys-29. The C-terminal cluster of 7 lysines is between Lys-188 and Lys-198. Thus, these two lysine-rich clusters (LRCs) contain 40% of all lysines in AdScQRS. Our strategy was to make deletion and point mutations that centered on the role of these LRCs. For assessing function in vivo, we made fusions with E. coli glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase of fragments bearing deletions and point mutations in AdScQRS, and we tested the ability of the fusion proteins to rescue growth of a yeast strain carrying a null allele of the gene for cytoplasmic glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase. For in vitro analysis, we relied on polyacrylamide co-electrophoresis to investigate effects of mutations on RNA binding. From this analysis, we were able to gain significant insight into the organization of determinants for the RNA binding activity of AdScQRS. Initial experiments focused on investigating whether either of the LRCs played a role in determining the ability of the fusion of AdScQRS to EcQRS to complement the yeast strain bearing the null allele of the gene for glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase. Seven different deletions in AdScQRS were constructed and fused to the N terminus of EcQRS. The results of individual complementation assays are shown in Fig.2 A, and a schematic summary of the results is given in Fig. 2 B. Fusions that joined either the N- or C-terminal LRC alone to EcQRS failed to complement. These fusions included AdScQRS-(1–42)-EcQRS and AdScQRS-(180–228)-EcQRS. These fusions used less than 50 residues from AdScQRS. Longer fusions (AdScQRS-(1–106) and AdScQRS-(107–228)) that extended the tested portions of AdScQRS to over 100 residues also failed to complement the null strain. Finally, fusion of the bulk of the spacer between the two LRCs also gave a protein (AdScQRS-(43–179) that did not complement the null strain. By using Western blot analysis with antibodies directed against the 12CA5 tag of EcQRS, we established that each of the defective fusion proteins was expressed and accumulated in yeast (data not shown). Thus, the failure to complement was not due to lack of stable production of the mutant proteins. In contrast, two fusion constructions were active in vivo. These constructs were AdScQRS-(1–179)-EcQRS and AdScQRS-(43–228)-EcQRS (Fig. 2, A andB). Each of these includes only one LRC but also encodes the spacer between the two LRCs. In one instance (AdScQRS-(1–179)-EcQRS), the spacer is joined to the C-terminal side of the LRC, whereas in the other (AdScQRS-(43–228)-EcQRS), it is joined to the N-terminal side. Empirically, there was no difference in the ability of either of these constructs to complement the null allele. In each of the two LRCs, contiguous lysines are present in two groupings. In the N-terminal LRC, these are Lys-19, Lys-20 and Lys-28, Lys-29. In the C-terminal LRC, the groupings include Lys-188, Lys-189, Lys-190 and Lys-196, Lys-197, Lys-198. We made tandem Lys to Ala substitutions in each of these groups to give, separately, proteins with the following mutations in AdScQRS: K19A/K20A, K28A/K29A, K188A/K189A, and K196A/K197A. Each of these four mutant proteins was fused to EcQRS, and the four resultant mutant fusion proteins were expressed in S. cerevisiae and tested for their ability to complement the null strain. None of these four failed to complement the defective yeast strain (Fig.3 A). We next constructed mutants of AdScQRS that had paired point substitutions in each of the LRCs. The rationale was that although mutants such as the K19A/K20A fusion protein were activein vivo, placement of an additional mutation in the same or the other LRC might be sufficient to cause inactivation. Thus, we visualized a “matrix” where we combined double mutations to give fusion proteins with four Lys to Ala substitutions. The matrix designed is summarized in Fig. 3 B, and the data supporting the entries in the matrix are reported in Fig.3 A. Two constructs failed to complement the null strain. Each of these (K19A/K20A/K188A/K189A and K28A/K29A/K188A/K189A) combined a double Lys to Ala replacement in the N-terminal LRC with a K188A/K189A substitution in the C-terminal motif. These results demonstrated the importance of Lys-188/Lys-189 relative to Lys-196/Lys-197 in the C-terminal LRC. They also suggest a functional role for both Lys-19/Lys-20 and Lys-28/Lys-29 in the N-terminal LRC. In contrast to the inactivation seen with fusion proteins having substitutions in both LRCs, those constructs with four replacements in the same LRC (K19A/K20A/K28A/K29A and K188A/K189AK196AK197A) were active. Thus, mutations are required in both LRCs in order to inactivate AdScQRS. This result supports the conclusion reached in the experiments with the deletion proteins (Fig. 2), namely that only one LRC is required for function in vivo. To correlate the complementation results shown in Figs. 2 and 3 with a biochemical phenotype, we investigated RNA binding with a transcript of S. cerevisiaetRNAGln as the RNA ligand. Affinity co-electrophoresis was used to assay for RNA binding (13.Gale A.J. Schimmel P. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8896-8903Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14.Cilley C.D. Williamson J.R. RNA (NY). 1997; 3: 57-67PubMed Google Scholar). With this assay, a gradient of each of the tested fusion proteins was established in the horizontal direction across the gel. Radioactively labeled RNA was then electrophoresed through that gradient. The binding of [32P]tRNA to the protein results in retardation of the tRNA, with retardation being the greatest where the protein concentration is the highest. In this way, a titration curve in the gel is obtained. We tested wild-type AdScQRS, AdScQRS-(1–106), AdScQRS-(107–228), AdScQRS(K19A/K20A), AdScQRS(K188A/K189A), and AdScQRS(K19A/K20A/K188A/K189A) in the RNA binding assay. The binding of wild-type AdScQRS was readily demonstrated, and the apparent K d value was similar to that (0.6 μm) previously measured for the binding of AdScQRS to unfractionated yeast tRNA (Fig.4 A). In contrast, the apparentK d value for the complex of AdScQRS-(1–106) and AdScQRS(107–228) with yeast tRNAGln was raised about 10-fold relative to the wild-type protein. This elevation in K d values for these two deletion proteins correlates with the failure of each of them to confer the complementation phenotype when fused to EcQRS (Fig. 2). In the case of the AdScQRS proteins harboring mutations in either or both of the LRCs, AdScQRS(K19A/K20A) and AdScQRS(K188A/K189A) each had a small but significant reduction in affinity for tRNAGln (Fig. 4 B). The apparent K d value of each was raised by roughly 3-fold. However, with mutations in both LRCs(AdScQRS(K19A/K20A/K188A/K189A)), the apparentK d value was raised about 10-fold and was similar to that seen with the deletion proteins. Thus, these results also correlate with the in vivo complementation analysis, where the AdScQRS(K19A/K20A) and AdScQRS(K188A/K189A)fusion proteins were active, and the fusion protein with substitutions in both LRCs was inactive (Fig. 2). We considered the possibility that each LCR forms a separate RNA-binding site so that two molecules of RNA were bound per AdScQRS. The affinity co-electrophoresis studies (Fig. 4) are not definitive in this regard, because a species with one bound RNA molecule is difficult to deconvolute from a species that has two bound RNAs. To address this issue more rigorously, sedimentation equilibrium analysis of a mixture of AdScQRS and tRNAfMet was performed at various speeds and concentrations. (For these experiments, we mostly used E. coli tRNAfMet because it was more easily obtained in quantities sufficient for study by ultracentrifugation. Our results showed that AdScQRS had approximately the same affinity for tRNAGln and tRNAfMet (data not shown).) Due to the difference in extinction coefficients between tRNA and AdScQRS (the extinction coefficient of tRNAfMet is significantly larger than that of AdScQRS), the contribution to the total absorbance at 260 nm by AdScQRS is negligible and thus allows us to follow the formation of the tRNA·AdScQRS complex by fitting data to the size of the tRNA species (16.Morales A.J. Swaijo M. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3475-3483Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Parallel experiments were performed to estimate the molecular masses in solution of the free tRNAfMet, free AdScQRS, and the AdScQRS·tRNA complex. For example, free tRNAfMet and AdScQRS have measured molecular masses of 24.1, and 27.7 kDa, respectively. A 1:1 molar ratio of tRNAfMet and AdScQRS at a concentration of 500 nm was spun at 12,000 rpm at 20 °C until equilibrium. The resulting data can be fit to a two-species system corresponding to the 27% free tRNAfMet (24.1 kDa) and 73% 1:1 tRNAfMet·AdScQRS complex (48.7 kDa) (Fig.5). The resulting χ2 error was estimated at 5.589 × 10−4. A 4:1 molar ratio of protein:tRNA with the tRNA at 500 nm was indicative of one species in solution with a molecular mass of 48.7 kDa with a χ2 error of 4.124 × 10−4. This corresponded to a 1:1 protein-tRNA complex (Fig. 5). Similar results were obtained at 10,000 rpm. We next used a traditional gel-mobility shift assay to confirm this conclusion. We imagined that if tRNA preferentially binds AdScQRS in a 2:1 ratio in the assay, then two species of complexes (1:1 and 2:1) would be observed at concentrations of AdScQRS close to the apparent K d(roughly 0.6 μm). However, only one species of AdScQRS·tRNA complex was detected at all tested concentrations of AdScQRS. That is, the same AdScQRS·tRNA complex was present at high as at low concentrations of AdScQRS (data not shown). Like yeast glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase, many eukaryote cytoplasmic class I tRNA synthetases have an extra domain appended to the N- or C-terminal end of the catalytic body (9.Mirande M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 95-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). This extra domain is not found in their E. coli counterparts. In higher eukaryotes some of these appended domains are believed to be involved in forming a multienzyme assembly (9.Mirande M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 95-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 18.Kerjan P. Cerini C. Semeriva M. Mirande M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1199: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), a complex that could potentially enhance the overall efficiency of protein synthesis. These appended domains in higher eukaryotes may also have specific cytokine and nonspecific RNA binding activities (19.Wakasugi K. Schimmel P. Science. 1999; 284: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 20.Cahuzac B. Berthonneau E. Birlirakis N. Guittet E. Mirande M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 445-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). In the yeast S. cerevisiae, each of at least six tRNA synthetases have an appended domain. However, the existence of a multisynthetase complex in yeast is controversial (9.Mirande M. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 95-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and other potential roles are just now being determined. These roles center around the ability of these domains to enhance formation of specific synthetase-tRNA complexes (6.Simos G. Sauer A. Fasiolo F. Hurt E.C. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 235-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 7.Whelihan E.F. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2968-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8.Wang C.-C. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16508-16512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Our previous data showed that the E. coli glutamine enzyme poorly acylates yeast tRNAGln and thus fails to rescue a yeast knockout allele of the gene for cytoplasmic glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase (7.Whelihan E.F. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2968-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8.Wang C.-C. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16508-16512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Fusing AdScQRS or an unrelated RNA binding domain to the E. coli enzyme raised the affinity of the E. coli enzyme for yeast tRNA to the point that the aminoacylation rate can sustain the growth of the yeast strain harboring a GLN4-disrupted allele (7.Whelihan E.F. Schimmel P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2968-2974Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 8.Wang C.-C. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16508-16512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Thus, an increase in tRNA binding affinity of the E. coli enzyme seemed to be all that was needed to boost the enzyme into a functional yeast enzyme. With this in mind, we attempted to rescue the yeast null allele with a construct that highly expressed the E. coli enzyme in vivo. To this end, the DNA coding sequence for the E. coli glutamine enzyme was cloned in a high copy number plasmid under the control of the constitutive alcohol dehydrogenase promoter and tested for its complementing activity. However, this construct failed to rescue growth of the yeast knockout strain (data not shown). Considering that the apparent K d value of theE. coli enzyme for yeast tRNAGln is lowered about 400-fold by the fusion of AdScQRS (8.Wang C.-C. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16508-16512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), this lowering of the K d is probably more than what can be compensated for by overproduction of the unfused E. colienzyme. Recently, we showed that fusion of the nonspecific tRNA–binding protein Arc1p to E. coli GlnRS also activated aminoacylation of yeast tRNAGln in vivo (8.Wang C.-C. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16508-16512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To extend further this finding, we showed that the appended domain of yeast glutamyl-tRNA synthetase (GluRS) can activate aminoacylation by E. coliGlnRS. For example, fusing the appended domain of the yeast glutamate enzyme to the E. coli GlnRS enabled the AdScERS-EcQRS fusion enzyme to complement a yeast knockout allele of the gene for cytoplasmic GlnRS (data not shown). Thus, like AdScQRS, the appended domain of the yeast GluRS (AdScERS) is probably an RNA-binding protein. Unlike AdScQRS, however, no lysine clusters have been found for AdScERS that are similar to those found in AdScQRS. Instead, the lysine residues of AdScERS are more evenly distributed throughout the entire sequence (data not shown). Similarly, Arc1p is not related in sequence to AdScQRS or AdScERS. Thus, it is not likely that AdScQRS, AdScERS, and Arc1p contact tRNA in exactly the same way. These considerations suggest that the main contribution of these domains is to increase the lifetime of the respective complex with tRNA, so that sufficient time is allowed for a conformational change that leads to a productive aminoacylation. Indeed, early work demonstrated a conformational change associated with a cognate but not a non-cognate synthetase-tRNA complex (21.Krauss G. Riesner D. Maass G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 68: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 22.Schimmel P.R. Söll D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1979; 48: 601-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). In contrast to most other RNA-binding proteins, AdScQRS is unique in the way that it binds to a wide variety of RNA substrates with a similar affinity (roughly 0.6–2 μm) (8.Wang C.-C. Schimmel P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16508-16512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Given the nonspecificity and modest affinity, we imagine that the AdScQRS·nucleic acid complexes derive much of their binding energy from electrostatic interactions. Indeed, our mutational analyses demonstrated the importance of lysine residues within the two LRCs of AdScQRS. Conceivably, these two LRCs are involved in direct contact with nucleic acids. Because deletions and mutations in either LRC can be tolerated as long as the linker between the two LRCs is intact, we believe these LRCs are functionally redundant. However, despite the presence of the two LRCs in one AdScQRS, the strict requirement for the linker (with either LRC) explains why the stoichiometry is limited to 1:1 (tRNA:AdScQRS). Our data are not clear on whether the essential spacer that connects the two LRCs plays a direct role in making RNA contacts or whether its role is indirect. Several RNA-binding motifs have been identified in proteins involved in diverse cellular functions. These include the ribonucleoprotein motif, arginine-rich motif, RGG box, and dsRNA-binding motif, among others (23.Kenan D.J. Query C.C. Keene J.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 214-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 24.Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1993; 73: 837-840Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 25.Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1731) Google Scholar). The particular RNA binding domain reported here seems to be the only one with lysine-rich clusters and thus might represent a novel class of RNA binding domains. The existing data suggest the possibility that AdScQRS has a general structural arrangement that is similar to the lysine/arginine-rich dsRNA binding domain of protein kinase PKR (26.Meurs E. Chong K. Galabru J. Thomas N.S. Kerr I.M. Williams B.R.G. Hovanessian A.G. Cell. 1990; 62: 379-390Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (818) Google Scholar). The NMR structure of the dsRNA binding domain of the free protein revealed a dumb-bell shape comprising two tandem RNA-binding motifs connected by a flexible linker (27.Nanduri S. Carpick B.W. Yang Y. Williams B.R.G. Qin J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5458-5465Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). Like AdScQRS, these RNA-binding elements are used to dock a single RNA molecule in a sequence-independent manner (28.Patel R.C. Sen G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7671-7676Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike AdScQRS, the RNA-binding elements of the dsRNA binding domain of protein kinase PKR are highly conserved (among eukaryotes) and bind exclusively to dsRNA (29.Bevilacqua P.C. Cech T.R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9983-9994Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). In contrast, AdScQRS is found in fungal organisms, and counterparts in higher eukaryotes have yet to be identified."

The gross structure of transhydrogenases from different species is strikingly invariant. The enzyme has three components; dI and dIII, which bind NAD(H) and NADP(H), respectively, protrude from the membrane (on the cytoplasmic side in bacteria, and the matrix side in mitochondria), and dII spans the membrane. Crystal structures of the dIII components of human and bovine transhydrogenases were recently described (4.Prasad G.S. Sridhar V. Yamaguchi M. Hatefi Y. Stout C.D. Nat. Struct.

Smith, P. G. Quirk, N. P. J. Cotton, and J. B. Jackson, manuscript in preparation. The basic fold of dIII is similar to the classical, dinucleotide-binding domain of lactate dehydrogenase, but NADP+ is bound with an unusual, “reversed” orientation. The nicotinamide ring of the bound NADP+ is exposed on a ridge of dIII. A homology model of dI (8.Quirk P.G. Smith K.J. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1412: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), based on the crystal structure of the sequence-related alanine dehydrogenase (9.Baker P.J. Sawa Y. Shibata H. Sedelnikova S.E. Rice D.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 561-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), suggests that the nicotinamide ring of NADH is located in a deep cleft. It was proposed that, in the complete transhydrogenase, the ridge of dIII inserts into the cleft of dI to bring the nicotinamide rings of the two nucleotides into apposition to effect direct hydride transfer (5.Jackson J.B. Peake S.J. White S., A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 464: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 6.White S.A. Peake S.J. McSweeney S. Leonard G. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B.

The protruding helix-D/loop-D of dIII is thought to interact with the membrane-spanning, dII and, together with the adjacent, lidlike loop E, which passes over the bound nucleotide, might be responsible for the energy transmission. The proton translocation steps during turnover are probably coupled specifically to changes in the mode of NADP(H) binding (1.Jackson J.B. Quirk P.G. Cotton N.P.J. Venning J.D. Gupta S. Bizouarn T.

Kinetic studies of transhydrogenase have also developed, following discoveries that fragments of the protein retain their nucleotide binding and some catalytic capacity. Thus, recombinant dI and dIII proteins, which bind their cognate nucleotides, have now been isolated from a number of species (11.Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J.

Without exception, experiments with dI·dIII complexes have been carried out with nucleotide analogues having altered absorbance spectra to facilitate measurement of the rate of reaction. In this report we describe transient state experiments with the physiological nucleotides. A procedure is described, in which single-turnover hydride transfer between NAD(H), on dI, and NADP(H), on dIII, is monitored by following changes in protein fluorescence. We use a natural Trp residue in human recombinant dIII, and an engineered Trp in the equivalentR. rubrum protein (20.Peake S.J. Venning J.D. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1413: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The oxidation/reduction step is faster than expected from studies with substrate analogues, and we can detect a driving force effect that arises from differences in the redox potentials of the natural and analogue substrates. DNA coding for the dI and dIII proteins of R. rubrumtranshydrogenase (rrdI2 andrrdIII, respectively), and the human dIII protein (hsdIII, the “long form”; Ref. 16.Peake S.J. Venning J.D. Jackson J.B.

The proteins were expressed and purified in their NADP+ forms by column chromatography (11.Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J.

R. rubrum dIII, in which Glu155had been mutated to a Trp residue, was derived by site-directed mutagenesis, as described (20.Peake S.J. Venning J.D. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Biochim. Biophys.

All protein preparations were checked for purity (>95%) by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (21.Lever T.M. Palmer T. Cunningham I.J. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J.

Protein concentrations were determined using the microtannin assay (22.Mejbaum-Katzenellenbogen S. Drobryszycka W.J. Clin. Chim. Acta. 1959; 4: 515-522Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar); they are expressed as monomeric values. Throughout this report, sequences are numbered according to theisolated protein components. Thus, Met1 ofrrdI corresponds to Met1 of PntAA (see Ref. 23.Williams R. Cotton N.P.J. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), Met1 of rrdIII corresponds to Met262of PntB (23.Williams R. Cotton N.P.J. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B.

When proteins were to be used for analysis by NMR, the host cells ofE. coli were grown on minimal medium (M9) containing 1 g/liter 15NH4Cl. They were purified as described above, and prepared for experiments as described (25.Quirk P.G. Jeeves M. Cotton N.P.J. Smith K.J. Jackson J.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar).1H,15N HSQC spectra were acquired, at a protein concentration of 600 μm, on a Bruker AMX 500 spectrometer, using the fast heteronuclear single quantum correlation (FHSQC) NMR spectroscopy pulse sequence (26.Mori S. Abeyguanawardana C. Johnson M.O. Vanzyl P. J. Magn. Res. Ser. B. 1995; 108: 94-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar). Proteins to be used in rapid mixing experiments were concentrated, and washed by filtration, in 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 20 mm Hepes, pH 8.0. Where required, NADP+ on dIII was replaced with NADPH, as described (17.Venning J.D. Grimley R.L. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27535-27538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 18.Venning J.D. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Quirk P.G. Jackson J.B. Eur. J.

Stopped-flow spectroscopy was performed, under the conditions described in the figure legends, on an Applied Photophysics DX-17MV instrument operating either in its absorbance mode at 375 nm, with an optical path length of 2 mm, or in its fluorescence mode, with 280 nm excitation light and >305 nm emission, isolated using a WG305 cut-off filter. The slits were set to 9.3 nm. In all stopped-flow experiments, the proteins and nucleotides were loaded into the instrument drive syringes in a buffer comprising 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 20 mm Hepes, pH8.0. Recordings of steady-state spectra on a Spex FluoroMax showed that fluorescence changes in the stopped-flow instrument originate from the protein Trp residues; changes resulting from nucleotide emission were negligible in the conditions employed. The kinetic data were fitted as described previously (17.Venning J.D. Grimley R.L. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. J. Biol.

The dead time of the instrument, measured as described (27.Tonomura B. Nakatani H. Ohnishi M. Yamaguchi-Ito J. Hiromi K. Anal. Biochem. 1978; 84: 370-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), was 1.31 ms. In calculating the amplitudes of absorbance and fluorescence changes, due correction was made for the signal undetected in the dead time. Rate constants were fitted to the kinetic scheme (see Reaction FR2) using the programs KINSIM (28.Barshop B.A. Wrenn R.F. Frieden C. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 130: 134-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar) and FITSIM (29.Zimmerle C.T. Frieden C. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Stopped-flow analysis of transhydrogenation (with substrate combinations AcPdAD+ + NADPH (Refs. 17.Venning J.D. Grimley R.L. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1998; 257: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and AcPdADH + NADP+ (Ref. 19.Venning J.D. Jackson J.B. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar)) in mixtures of dI and dIII proteins revealed a burst of reaction before onset of the very slow steady-state rate. The burst is limited to a single turnover of dIII by the slow release of product, either NADP+ or NADPH. In mixtures of rrdI + rrdIII, the burst is biphasic. The fast phase (phase A), which is predominant at high concentrations of dI (relative to dIII), is thought to correspond to hydride transfer in dI·dIII complexes present at the instant of mixing. The slow phase (phase B), which is predominant at low concentrations of dI (relative to dIII), is thought to result from the multiple turnovers of dI that are required to complete the single turnover of dIII. Phase B is limited by the dissociation of dI·dIII complexes; the re-association of the proteins and the exchange of nucleotides on dI are both relatively fast. Fig. 1 shows that the stopped-flow kinetics of AcPdAD+ reduction by NADPH with mixtures of rrdI and rrdIII.E155W (trace b) were indistinguishable, within error, from those obtained with mixtures of rrdI and wild-typerrdIII (trace a). The reaction was measured from the absorbance change at 375 nm, which corresponds to formation of AcPdADH. The apparent first order rate constants for phase A (558 and 610 s−1) and for phase B (32 and 28 s−1) were similar for the wild-type and the mutant dIII proteins. We previously showed that the steady-state kinetics of transhydrogenation are not significantly affected by this amino acid substitution (20.Peake S.J. Venning J.D. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1413: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and, furthermore, 1H,15N HSQC NMR spectra of rrdIII.E155W (in the NADP+ and NADPH forms) differed from spectra of wild-type protein (25.Quirk P.G. Jeeves M. Cotton N.P.J. Smith K.J. Jackson J.B. FEBS Lett. 1999; 446: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 30.Jeeves M. Smith K.J. Quirk P.G. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 305-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) only in those resonances that are assigned to residues close to the site of the mutation (data not shown). Wild-type rrdI has a single Trp residue (at position 72), and wild-type rrdIII has no Trp. The change in protein fluorescence that accompanies the burst of AcPdAD+reduction by NADPH with a mixture of wild-type rrdI andrrdIII is also shown in Fig. 1 (trace c). There was a very small decrease in fluorescence with approximately similar kinetics to those of hydride transfer. It probably resulted from the quenching of dI-Trp72fluorescence by the weakly binding product, AcPdADH (Ref. 11.Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but the signal/noise ratio was too small for detailed analysis. The protein fluorescence of a mixture of rrdI andrrdIII.E155W under similar conditions substantially increased during the reduction of AcPdAD+ by NADPH (trace d). The signal/noise ratio was more than adequate to show that the kinetics of the fluorescence change were very similar in character to those of the 375-nm absorbance change. Both were distinctly biphasic. Within error, the k appvalues for phase A (603 ± 71 s−1 and 571 ± 58 s−1 in fluorescence and absorbance measurements, respectively), and for phase B (30.5 ± 6.8 s−1 and 29.3 ± 7.2 s−1) were similar. For reasons that will be discussed below, the amplitude of phase A of the fluorescence change was routinely a slightly greater fraction of the total amplitude of the burst, than was the amplitude of phase A of the absorbance change (e.g. 74 ± 10% compared with 59 ± 7%, for 37.5 μm dI and 37.5 μm dIII). The very slow, steady-state increase in the absorbance at 375 nm due to the reduction of AcPdAD+ during multiple turnovers (seen only on long time scales (Ref. 13.Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar)) was not evident in fluorescence measurements (data not shown). We propose that the fluorescence increase during the burst of hydride transfer results mainly from the change in occupancy of the dIII protein; bound NADP+ leads to greater Trp155 fluorescence than bound NADPH (14.Fjellstrom O. Johansson C. Rydstrom J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 11331-11341Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 15.Fjellstrom O. Bizouarn T. Zhang J. Rydstrom J. Venning J.D. Jackson J.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 20.Peake S.J. Venning J.D. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1413: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Consistent with this interpretation, the replacement of phase A with phase B, as the concentration of the dI protein was increased (18.Venning J.D. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Quirk P.G. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), was also observed in fluorescence experiments (Fig.2). The phenomenon was discussed in detail (18.Venning J.D. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Quirk P.G. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 19.Venning J.D. Jackson J.B. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, it results from an increase in the concentration of dI·dIII complex (and therefore in the fraction of phase A) at increasing dI concentrations, and a corresponding decrease in the concentration of free dIII.NADPH that, for oxidation, requires multiple turnover of dI (the fraction of phase B). In both absorbance and fluorescence experiments, the value of k appfor phase A was independent of the dI concentration, as expected if it reflects intracomplex hydride transfer. The increase in thek app for phase B with dI concentration, in both sets of experiments, is a consequence of a lower rate of formation of dead end complex (18.Venning J.D. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Quirk P.G. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In a separate series of experiments, we monitored the burst of transhydrogenation from AcPdADH to NADP+ by following the absorbance decrease at 375 nm. The kinetics were similar in mixtures ofrrdI plus rrdIII.E155W (results not shown), and in mixtures of rrdI plus rrdIII (see Ref. 19.Venning J.D. Jackson J.B. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). With rrdI and rrdIII.E155W (but not withrrdI and rrdIII), a large decrease in protein fluorescence was observed, with similar kinetics to the 375 nm absorbance decrease. In contrast to the experiments with AcPdAD+ and NADPH (see above), the amplitude of phase A was a slightly smaller fraction of the total burst in the fluorescence measurements, although, again, there was no significant difference in the apparent rate constants. The above experiments indicate that it should be possible to monitor transient-state hydride transfer betweenphysiological nucleotides in dI·dIII complexes by recording changes in dIII tryptophan fluorescence. Previously, real-time observations were impossible because of the similar absorbance spectra of NAD(H) and NADP(H). Fig.3 shows that a biphasic fluorescencedecrease was observed upon mixing rrdI plusrrdIII.E155W loaded with NADP+ (syringe 1), and NADH (syringe 2) in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer, and a biphasic fluorescence increase was observed upon mixingrrdI plus rrdIII.E155W loaded with NADPH (syringe 1), and NAD+ (syringe 2). We attribute this, in the “forward” experiment, to reduction of NADP+ on dIII (decrease in Trp155 fluorescence), and in the “reverse” experiment, to oxidation of NADPH on dIII (increase in Trp155 fluorescence). The release of product NADP(H) is expected to be very slow (13.Diggle C. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 241: 162-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The fluorescence burst during transhydrogenation from NADPH to NAD+ was monitored in a set of experiments performed at a fixed concentration of rrdIII.E155W and variablerrdI (Fig. 4). The results were very similar to those obtained for hydride transfer between NADP(H) and AcPdAD(H), as observed in both absorbance measurements (18.Venning J.D. Bizouarn T. Cotton N.P.J. Quirk P.G. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 257: 202-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and fluorescence measurements (Fig. 2). Notably, the fast phase (phase A) replaced the slow phase (phase B) as the dI concentration was increased, the k app for phase A was independent of dI concentration, and the k app for phase B increased with the dI concentration (see above). This clearly establishes the internal consistency of the proposed mechanisms. Attempts to determine the k app values of phase A for forward and reverse transhydrogenation at saturating concentrations of NADH and NAD+, respectively, are shown in Fig.5; both sets of experiments were performed with protein concentrations that ensured dominance by phase A. Phase A of the forward reaction with physiological nucleotides was very fast. The maximum value of k app that can be measured by the spectrophotometer is approximately 800–900 s−1, and this was exceeded at concentrations of NADH in excess of 50–100 μm. Phase A of the fluorescence change during the reverse reaction was slower and, therefore, easier to resolve. At close-to-saturating concentrations of NAD+, at 20.8 °C, the value of k app was approximately 600 s−1. For reasons that will be explained below, the dependence of the phase A k app for reverse transhydrogenation on the concentration of NAD+ was also determined at a lower temperature; at 7.8 °C thek app value at saturating nucleotide was approximately 60% less than that at 20.8 °C (Fig. 5). To provide a more complete description of the hydride transfer step in dI·dIII complexes with physiological nucleotides, we have determined the on andoff rate constants for NAD(H) and isolated rrdI from changes in Trp72 fluorescence (11.Diggle C. Hutton M. Jones G.R. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 719-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The kinetic profile of fluorescence quenching with NADH was too fast to measure accurately in the stopped-flow machine above 15 °C, but at lower temperatures the reaction fitted to a single exponential (not shown). Assuming that binding is a simple, one-step reaction, and provided that the concentration of NADH is much greater (>10-fold) than that of dI, it can be easily shown (e.g. Ref. 31.Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. 2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York1985Google Scholar) thatk obs = k on[NADH] +k off. Thus, values of k onand k off are obtained from the gradient and intercept, respectively, of a plot of [NADH] versus k obs. The validity of the approach was supported by the linear dependence of k obs on NADH concentration (Fig. 6, upper panel). Between 8 and 15 °C, k offexhibited a classical temperature dependence; Arrhenius plots (data not shown) yielded an activation energy of 135 kJ·mol−1. Extrapolation to higher temperatures gave values that were within the range suggested by NMR experiments (32.Diggle C. Cotton N.P.J. Grimley R.L. Quirk P.G. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 232: 315-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 33.Bizouarn T. Diggle C. Quirk P.G. Grimley R.L. Cotton N.P.J. Thomas C.M. Jackson J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10103-10108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Values ofk on for NADH binding were less steeply dependent on temperature; the activation energy was 22 kJ·mol−1. A low activation energy for k on and a large value for k off are not uncommon for ligand-protein interactions. Extrapolation to 20 °C gave k on≈ 2 × 107m−1s−1, k off ≈ 810 s−1and K d (≈40 μm) in good agreement with the K d value obtained by equilibrium dialysis (30 ± 2 μm) (34.Bizouarn T. Diggle C. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The k off for NAD+ andrrdI was obtained from competition experiments. The protein was incubated with NAD+, at a concentration high enough to ensure substantial occupation of the binding sites. Upon subsequent addition of NADH in the stopped-flow spectrophotometer, the emission from Trp72 was quenched with approximately first-order kinetics as the reduced nucleotide replaced the bound NAD+. At high concentrations of NADH, the rate of fluorescence quenching becomes limited by k off for NAD+. Because of the rapid rate of NAD+ release, reliable data were only obtained at temperatures below 15 °C. Fig. 6(lower panel) shows the results of experiments with 1 mm NAD+; equivalent experiments (data not shown) were performed with 5 mm NAD+ and yielded similar values of k off. The internal consistency of the measured rate constants was checked by performing a simulation of each experimental trace using the measured values ofk on and k off for NADH (see above) and K d ≈ 300 μm for NAD+. Arrhenius plots of the measured values ofk off for NAD+ were linear, and gave an activation energy of 54 kJ·mol−1. Extrapolation to 20 °C yielded k off ≈ 1700 s−1. Using the K d (≈ 300 μm) obtained by equilibrium dialysis (34.Bizouarn T. Diggle C. Jackson J.B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 737-741C"

Screening a cDNA library from anaerobically grown rice coleoptiles, we isolated myb7, a cDNA derived from a Myb-encoding unspliced mRNA (8.Menguzzato E. Valle G. Coraggio I. Plant Physiol. 1995; 109 (PGR95-104): 1498Google Scholar). Some features of myb7 sequence indicate that it may be post-transcriptionally regulated; in particular, two unspliced introns are present in positions that are conserved with respect to other plant myb genes. Both spliced and unspliced myb7 mRNAs are present in vivo (7.Magaraggia F. Solinas G. Valle G. Giovinazzo G. Coraggio I. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 1003-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In aerobically grown rice roots, we observed a higher proportion of unspliced myb7 RNA, with respect to the spliced form. The spliced form is instead predominant in rice roots during anoxia, a stress situation that generally inhibits splicing (14.Ortiz D.F. Strommer J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 2090-2095Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that post-transcriptional regulation controls the ratio betweenmyb7 unspliced and spliced forms (7.Magaraggia F. Solinas G. Valle G. Giovinazzo G. Coraggio I. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 35: 1003-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the 5′ region of the first intron can direct the synthesis of an in-frame leucine zipper, a functional domain present in several transcription factors (15.Cole M.D. Cell. 1991; 65: 715-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 16.DeVetten N.C.

A. 1990; 87: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). The putative polypeptide encoded by the unspliced myb7mRNA consists of an incomplete Myb domain followed by the leucine zipper: we therefore named it Mybleu. Mybleu does not have the characteristics of a functional transcription factor. Indeed, it should be unable to bind DNA because of the presence of an incomplete Myb repeat. Moreover, neither a putative transcriptional activator region nor a consensus for nuclear targeting can be identified in Mybleu. The synthesis of the putative Mybleu polypeptide may, however, provide the cell with a mechanism able to regulate the dimerization and hence activity of other transcription factors. Our main goal in this study was to determine whether Mybleu is able to interact with a leucine zipper protein and modulate its activity. To this purpose, we have transiently expressed Mybleu in tobacco protoplasts together with the maize leucine zipper Opaque2 (O2)1. Transient assays are used widely to provide functional information on transcription factors (19 and references therein). O2 is a very well characterized plant leucine zipper transcription factor that transactivates the b32 promoter both in maize endosperm and in transient assay in tobacco protoplasts (18.Schmidt R.J. Burr F.A. Aukerman M.J. Burr B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 46-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar, 20.Lohmer S. Maddaloni M. Motto M. Di Fonzo N. Hartings H. Salamini F.

EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2795-2801Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Moreover, recent data suggest that a bZIP protein functionally similar to O2 may exist in rice (22.Wu C.Y. Suzuki A. Washida H. Takaiwa F. Plant J. 1998; 14: 673-683Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). We show that Mybleu does not inhibit, but instead enhances the transactivation on the b32 promoter by O2. This effect seems to be driven by heterodimers, which are quantitatively formed between O2 and Mybleu. We also show that Mybleu is located in the nucleus both in rice cells and in transformed tobacco protoplasts. Therefore, a heterodimer consisting of two natural leucine zipper transcription factors, one complete and the other lacking the transcriptional and binding domains, is able to activate transcription in plant cells. Mybleu presence in rice strongly suggests that such a mechanism is a natural one. Maintenance of in vitro shoot cultures ofNicotiana tabacum (cultivar Petit-Havana, SRI) and preparation of apical segments from rice (cultivar Arborio) roots and coleoptiles were described previously (23.Giovinazzo G.

The intronic KpnI-XbaI fragment, coding for the 33 COOH-terminal amino acids of Mybleu, absent in the Myb protein encoded by the spliced mRNA (7.Magaraggia F. Solinas G. Valle G. Giovinazzo G.

Representation of the plasmids used in this work is in Fig. 1 A. Mesophyll protoplasts from tobacco leaves were isolated according to Nagy and Maliga (28.Nagy J.I. Maliga P. Z. Pflanzenphysiol. 1976; 78: 453-544Crossref Google Scholar) and Potrykus and Shillito (29.Potrykus I. Shillito R.D. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 118: 549-578Crossref Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and transformed according to Bilang et al. (30.Bilang R. Kloti A. Schrott M. Potrykus I. Gelvin S.B. Shulperoort R.A. Plant Molecular Biology Manual. Kluwer, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 1-16Crossref Google Scholar). Protoplast viability was checked by the fluorescein diacetate method (31.Widholm J.M. Stain Technol. 1972; 47: 189-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Protoplast extracts were used for GUS and CAT activity determinations. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Lowry as modified by Peterson (32.Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7126) Google Scholar). Results are the means of at least four transformation experiments. GUS activity was determined according to Jefferson (33.Jefferson R.A. Plant Mol. Biol. Rep. 1987; 5: 387-405Crossref Scopus (4029) Google Scholar). CAT activity was assayed as described by Sambrook et al. (34.Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 64-65Google Scholar). Protoplast transformations with GUS-expressing constructs always included an internal reference marker (10 μg of pCaMVCAT plasmid), and the level of GUS expression was referred as a ratio between the coexpressed GUS and CAT activities. Transactivation of theb32 promoter was expressed as fold stimulation with respect to the GUS expression driven by the pB32GUSII plasmid alone. Because pCaMV-O2 (20.Lohmer S. Maddaloni M. Motto M. Di Fonzo N. Hartings H. Salamini F. Thompson R.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) and pCaMVMybleu are similar in size (4.7 and 4.4 kb, respectively), we considered equal amounts of them as equimolar. Cytoplasmic and nuclei-enriched subcellular fractions from frozen root and coleoptile segments and from transformed protoplasts were isolated as described (24.Breviario D. Gianı̀ S. Morello L. Coraggio I. Plant, Cell Environ. 1994; 17: 925-934Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar) and then loaded on discontinuous Percoll gradient to obtain a pure nuclear fraction (35.Chiatante D. Brusa P. Levi M. Sgorbati S. Sparvoli E. Physiol. Plant. 1990; 78: 501-506Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The purity of the nuclear preparations was assayed by UV fluorescence microscopy after DAPI (1 μg/ml) staining. Nuclear or cytoplasmic proteins from rice roots and coleoptiles and nuclear proteins from transformed protoplasts (800 μg) were immunoprecipitated with anti-O2 or anti-Mybleu antiserum, as described by D'Amico et al. (36.D'Amico L. Valvasina B. Daminati M.G. Fabbrini M.S. Nitti G. Bollini R. Ceriotti A. Vitale A. Plant J. 1992; 2: 443-455PubMed Google Scholar). Total nuclear or cytoplasmic extracts and immunoprecipitated proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (37.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206999) Google Scholar) and blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (PROTRAN BA 85, 0.20 μm, Schleicher & Schuell) (38.Ciceri P. Gianazza E. Lazzari B. Lippoli G. Genga A. Hoschek G. Schmidt R.J. Viotti A. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 97-108PubMed Google Scholar). Immunodetection of total extracts was performed by Western blot according to Harlow and Lane (39.Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 321-349Google Scholar). The detection of immunoprecipitated proteins was performed using only the primary rabbit antisera (anti-Mybleu and anti-O2), coupled to alkaline phosphatase (40.Blake M.S. Johnston K.H. Russell-Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts from transformed tobacco protoplasts used to perform gel shift experiments were prepared as described by Schmidt et al. (41.Schmidt R.J. Ketudat M. Aukerman M.J. Hoschek G. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Nuclear extracts (500 μg) of protoplasts transformed with plasmids expressing O2, Mybleu, or both were loaded on a continuous 5–25% (w/v) linear sucrose gradient (42.Ceriotti A. Pedrazzini E. Fabbrini M.S. Zoppe M. Bollini R. Vitale A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). A mixture (50 μg each) of cytochrome c (12 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), bovine serum albumin (67 kDa), aldolase (a 142-kDa trimer) and catalase (a 232-kDa tetramer) was used as a marker for molecular mass separation along the gradient. Samples were centrifuged at 39,000 rpm in a SW40 Ti rotor (Beckman, Fullerton, CA) for 40 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation, gradients were collected in 700-μl fractions. Density was measured with a refractometer. An aliquot (350–700 μl) of each fraction was trichloroacetic acid precipitated and analyzed by Western blot after 15% acrylamide SDS-PAGE (37.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206999) Google Scholar, 38.Ciceri P.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988: 321-349Google Scholar). This assay was performed according to a described procedure (41.Schmidt R.J. Ketudat M. Aukerman M.J. Hoschek G. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The following double strand oligonucleotides were used (the O2 binding sites are indicated in bold). 5′-GGCATTCCACGTAGATAACC-3′ corresponding to the O2 binding site on the zein promoter. 5′-GGCCGCTCCACGTAGATAAGCTTCATTCCACGTAGATCTAG-3′ containing two O2 binding sites of the zein promoter (38.Ciceri P. Gianazza E. Lazzari B. Lippoli G. Genga A. Hoschek G. Schmidt R.J. Viotti A. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 97-108PubMed Google Scholar). 5′-GGAGATGATGTGGAAAGTTAGTGGGAGATGATATGGATGCC-3′ corresponding to the B2 and B3 O2 binding sites of the b32promoter. 5′-GGACGAGATGATGTGGAACC-3′ corresponding to the B3 O2 binding site of the b32 promoter. 5′-GGACGAGTTGACGTTGAACC-3′corresponding to the B5 O2 binding site of the b32 promoter (20.Lohmer S. Maddaloni M. Motto M. Di Fonzo N. Hartings H. Salamini F. Thompson R.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides were annealed and labeled as described by Ciceriet al. (38.Ciceri P. Gianazza E. Lazzari B. Lippoli G. Genga A. Hoschek G. Schmidt R.J. Viotti A. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 97-108PubMed Google Scholar). 10 μg of transformed protoplasts nuclear extract for each sample were incubated 10 min at room temperature in binding buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA, 10% glycerol) containing KCl at three different concentrations (40, 70, 100 mm). The probe was then added to the extracts and the reactions allowed for 20 min at room temperature. Samples were then loaded onto a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 23 mm Tris borate, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8. Gels were run at 4 °C, dried, and autoradiographed. The presence and the relative amount of O2 and Mybleu in the extracts were assayed by Western blot (data not shown). Immunocytochemical analysis on tobacco transformed protoplasts was performed as reported (43.Jung J.L. Bouzoubaa S. Gilmer D. Hahne G. Plant Cell Rep. 1992; 11: 346-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Phosphatase activity was detected by 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (Sigma) in a 5-min reaction (40.Blake M.S. Johnston K.H. Russell-Jones G.J. Gotschlich E.C. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 136: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (1629) Google Scholar). Nuclei were stained with the DNA-specific fluorochrome DAPI (2 μg/ml). Nitrocellulose filters were examined and photographed under a Zeiss Axioplan fluorescence microscope, using an excitation filter LP 400 to detect DAPI fluorescence. For immunochemical assays on rice tissues, roots and coleoptiles were spread on nitrocellulose filters by applying them with gentle pressure. Tissue prints were then processed for immunodetection as described above. The presence of a leucine zipper domain and the absence of both DNA binding and transactivation domains suggest that Mybleu might act as a dominant repressor, according to the results obtained with other incomplete transcription factors (44.Miao Z.H. Lam E. Plant J. 1995; 7: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 45.Olive M. Williams S.C. Dezan C. Johnson P.F. Vinson C. J. Biol.

We therefore investigated the action of Mybleu on the activity of O2, using as a target the b32 promoter. The in vivoassays were performed in transiently transformed tobacco protoplasts, using the plasmids shown in Fig. 1 A. We first verified whether cotransformations of protoplasts with several plasmids carrying the same strong promoter region (CaMV 35S) influence the expression of the individual constructs. Increasing amounts (10–60 μg/test) of pCaMVNeo did not affect the expression of 10 μg of pCaMVCAT or pCaGUS (data not shown). Therefore, we compared the GUS expression driven by the b32 promoter in the presence of O2, Mybleu, or both. Surprisingly, Mybleu did not inhibit O2 transactivation, but had a stimulatory effect (Fig. 1 B). The fold stimulation of Mybleu on O2 activity was always similar, within a wide range of amounts of plasmids expressed (0.1–10 μg/test; Fig. 1 B). The stimulation driven by 1 μg of O2 seems higher at lower concentrations of the b32 promoter because our unit of measure is the GUS activity driven by theb32 promoter in the absence of O2. This is, of course, markedly higher at higher concentrations of the b32promoter; for this reason the transactivation efficiency (fold stimulation) of a given amount of O2 seems lower at higher concentration of b32 promoter, unless the amount of the promoter is limiting. A pCaMV-O2 dependent (0.1–10 μg range) linear enhancement of the GUS expression was observed both when 1 μg and 10 μg of pB32GUSII were used (data not shown). These results suggest that the effect of Mybleu on O2 activity does not depend on its interaction with an unknown tobacco cellular factor that may sequester O2. If a tobacco factor able to interact with O2 and inhibit its activity existed, it would be saturable. In this case, the Mybleu effect would be higher at lower O2, and Mybleu concentrations and the O2-driven transactivation of theb32 promoter would be less efficient at lower concentrations of O2. The possibility of a direct activity of Mybleu on theb32 promoter was also ruled out because in the absence of O2, Mybleu did not stimulate the activity of the b32promoter (Fig. 1 B). Finally, as shown in Fig. 1 B, the GUS activities induced by 8 μg of pCaMV-O2 or 4 μg of pCaMV-O2 and 4 μg of pCaMVMybleu are similar and significantly higher than the activity induced by 4 μg of pCaMV-O2. The possible direct physical interaction between Mybleu and O2 was tested by immunoprecipitation experiments. Nuclear extracts of protoplasts transformed with pCaMV-O2, pCaMVMybleu, or both plasmids (10 μg each) were immunoprecipitated with anti-O2 or anti-Mybleu antiserum and analyzed by Western blot with a mixture of both antisera. As shown in Fig. 2 A, both antisera (Ab O2 and MYB) immunoprecipitated specifically the correspondent antigen in single transformants (O2 and MYB). The specificity of immunoprecipitations was confirmed by the absence of immunoprecipitated proteins in pCaMV-O2 transformed protoplasts by Mybleu antiserum andvice versa. Therefore, the coimmunoprecipitation of both factors with any of the two antisera in the double transformants (O2/MYB) indicates a direct interaction. Immunoprecipitation appeared quantitative for both proteins, irrespectively of the antiserum used, suggesting a complete interaction between Mybleu and O2 (Fig.2 B, lanes 3 and 6). Consistently, using anti-Mybleu antiserum, we were unable to immunoprecipitate any protein from the supernatant after immunoprecipitation with anti-O2 antiserum and vice versa (Fig. 2 B, lanes 2 and 4). We were finally unable to detect O2 or Mybleu analyzing by Western blot the supernatants of the immunoprecipitations, indicating that the two proteins were quantitatively available for immunoprecipitation (data not shown). To determine the assembly state of Mybleu and O2, nuclear extracts from tobacco protoplasts transformed with plasmids expressing O2, Mybleu, or both (10 μg/each) were loaded onto preformed linear sucrose gradients (5–25% w/v) and subjected to sedimentation velocity centrifugation. A mixture of molecular mass markers was also centrifuged. Each fraction of the marker gradient was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and the gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Fig.3, panel A). Each fraction of the nuclear extract gradients was analyzed by Western blot using a mixture of anti-Mybleu and anti-O2 antisera as primary antiserum. In the single transformants, the position of both O2 and Mybleu along the gradient matched the one expected for the respective homodimers (Fig. 3 panel B, fractions 2 and 3, and panel C, fractions 6–8). In the double transformant, both proteins migrated in the position expected for heterodimers (Fig. 3, panel D, fractions 4 and 5). The identity of the two bands was confirmed assaying an aliquot of fraction 5 of the double transformant gradient by Western blot, using anti-Mybleu, anti-O2, or both primary antisera (data not shown). These results demonstrate that Mybleu and O2 form heterodimers and that heterodimer formation is dominant over O2·O2 homodimer assembly. To analyze directly the DNA binding properties of O2 and Mybleu, we assayed the ability of homo- and heterodimers to bind the O2 binding sites by gel shift experiments (Fig. 4). We used 10 μg of nuclear extract from protoplasts transformed with pCaMVMybleu (lanes 2), pCaMVO2 (lanes 3), or both constructs (lanes 4) and, as a control, the nuclear extract of mock transformed protoplasts (lanes 1). Under the salt conditions described for O2-DNA binding (41.Schmidt R.J. Ketudat M. Aukerman M.J. Hoschek G. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 689-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar), we were able to detect O2-mediated probe retardation using the oligonucleotides corresponding to the O2 binding site present in the zein promoter (oligonucleotidesO2 and O2B, containing respectively one and two O2 binding sites (Ref. 38.Ciceri P. Gianazza E. Lazzari B. Lippoli G. Genga A. Hoschek G. Schmidt R.J. Viotti A. Plant Cell. 1997; 9: 97-108PubMed Google Scholar); Fig. 4, panels A andB, lanes 3). The results obtained using several oligonucleotides under different salt conditions are shown inpanels B, C, and D (40, 70, and 100 mm, respectively). Increasing the KCl concentration, we could also detect probe retardation using oligonucleotide 2,3 B32 (20.Lohmer S. Maddaloni M. Motto M. Di Fonzo N. Hartings H. Salamini F. Thompson R.D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) (panels C and D, lanes 3). Oligonucleotide 5 B32 is retarded only under very high salt concentration (panel D, lane 3). We were not able to detect a retarded complex using the 3 B32oligonucleotide. The fact that the extract from O2-expressing protoplasts, but not the one from protoplasts expressing both O2 and Mybleu, produced a retarded complex is consistent with the fact that O2-homodimers are not detectable in cotransformed cells (Figs. 2 and 3). In Mybleu there is no canonical nuclear localization sequence. To determine whether the transactivation activity of Mybleu in the presence of O2 results from O2-mediated nuclear localization of Mybleu, we performed immunolocalization experiments and Western blots on nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts. Fig.5 shows protoplasts transformed with pCaMVMybleu (MYBLEU column), pCaMV- O2 (O2 column), and both (O2/MYBLEU column) (10 μg/each). Immunocytochemical localization (odd rows) was performed using antiserum against either O2 or Mybleu, as primary antibodies; as controls, antisera against the cytoplasmic protein actin and preimmune serum were used. Nuclei were evidenced by DAPI staining (even rows). Immunocytochemical localization, performed on protoplasts transformed with individual constructs, indicated that Mybleu is able to enter the nucleus in the absence of O2. A similar result was obtained by Western blot analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts of protoplasts transformed with plasmids expressing O2, Mybleu, or both (data not shown). We aimed to verify whether unspliced myb7 mRNA, encoding Mybleu, was translated in rice. In fact, the existence of Mybleu in rice would strongly suggest a similar role in modulating activity of a natural rice transcription factor. Rice coleoptiles grow under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, whereas roots are unable to grow under anoxia.

We have analyzed the function of this region and the effect of its farnesylation with respect to the action of the GDP/GTP exchange factors (GEFs) Cdc25p and Sdc25p and the target adenylyl cyclase. Whereas Ras2p farnesylation had no effect on the interaction with purified GEFs from the Cdc25 family, this modification became a strict requirement for stimulation of the nucleotide exchange on Ras using reconstituted cell-free systems with GEFs bound to the cell membrane. Determination of GEF effects showed that in cell membrane the Cdc25p dependent activity on Ras2p was predominant over that of Sdc25p. In contrast to full-length GEFs, a membrane-bound C-terminal region containing the catalytic domain of Cdc25p was still able to react productively with unfarnesylated Ras2p. These results indicate that in membrane-bound full-length GEF the N-terminal moiety regulates the interaction between catalytic domain and farnesylated Ras2p·GDP. Differently from GEF, full activation of adenylyl cyclase did not require farnesylation of Ras2p·GTP, even if this step of maturation was found to facilitate the interaction. The use of Ha-Ras/Ras2p chimaeras of different length emphasized the key role of the hypervariable region of Ras2p in inducing maximum activation of adenylyl cyclase and for a productive interaction with membrane-bound GEF.

The level of activated Ras is controlled by the GTPase-activating protein and the GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF)1 which in the case ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae are Ira1p/Ira2p (2.Buchberg A.M.

Ishikawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2355-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). One major difference between yeast and mammalian Ras proteins lies in their C-terminal hypervariable region which in the case of Ras from the former organism is much more extended (∼120 versus ∼20 aa residues). The function of this overextended C-terminal region is as yet unclear. Association with the cell membrane is an essential condition for the function of Ras proteins. Translocation of Ras to the inner surface of the membrane is promoted by sequential post-translational modifications of the C-terminal CAAX consensus box (10.Casey P.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The first step, the farnesylation of cysteine, is followed by proteolytic cleavage of the AAX peptide, methyl-esterification of the exposed isoprenylated cysteine and in the case of human N-Ras, Ha-Ras, andS. cerevisiae Ras1p and Ras2p, palmitoylation of one or two cysteines located upstream to the CAAX motif (11.Hancock J.F.

After farnesylation, AAX proteolysis and methylation, Ras proteins are still mainly cytosolic; their tight association with the plasma membrane requires palmitoylation (12.Hancock J.F. Paterson H.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6403-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). In yeast farnesylation of Ras2p was found to be important for the interaction with the adenylyl cyclase-CAP complex (21.Kuroda Y. Suzuki N. Kataoka T. Science. 1993; 259: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 22.Shima F. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Yanagihara C. Tamada M. Okada T. Kariya K.I. Kataoka T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1057-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Information on the role of farnesylation in the activity of yeast Cdc25p and Sdc25p is so far limited to the observation that the isolated catalytic domain of Cdc25p promoted the nucleotide exchange on prenylated Ras and even more strongly on unprocessed Ras (15.Porfiri E. Evans T. Chardin P. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22672-22677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In this work we have analyzed the role of the C-terminal hypervariable region of Ras proteins and its farnesylation in the interaction with both full-length exchange factors Cdc25p and Sdc25p, and in the activation of adenylyl cyclase. As methodological approach, a well defined reconstituted in vitro system using membrane preparations from isogenic yeast strains was utilized in order to mimicin vivo conditions and compensate for the fact that the isolated full-length Cdc25p and Sdc25p are not yet available despite considerable efforts. In this context the activities of these two GEFs as components bound to the cell membrane were characterized and compared with the activity of membrane-bound GEF C-terminal region. The obtained results have further enlighted the regulatory role of the N-terminal region of GEF on the C-terminal catalytic domain and demonstrated the absolute requirement of Ras2p farnesylation for a productive interaction. The construction of Ha-Ras/Ras2p chimaeras has selectively defined the importance of the hypervariable region of yeast Ras for the activation of adenylyl cyclase.DISCUSSIONThe reconstituted cell-free system used in this study reproducesin vitro the physiological conditions of the interaction between Ras and GEFs or adenylyl cyclase as cell membrane-bound components. Our observation that farnesylation of Ras2p did not affect the GDP dissociation mediated by purified catalytic domains of yeast GEFs or full-length CDC25 Mm emphasizes the need for a system in which these Ras ligands are associated with the cell membrane to study physiologically relevant interactions. The use of CRI4 adenylyl cyclase strains allowed the isolation of Ras- and GEF-free membranes, and enabled the selective study of the effect of Ras2p farnesylation on Cdc25p or Sdc25p interaction by bypassing the lethality of the deletions. In this system the activity of membrane-associated full-length GEFs was strictly dependent on farnesylation of Ras2p. A relevant residual exchange activity was observed in membranes from strains with disrupted CDC25 gene, that was also strictly dependent on farnesylation of Ras2p and could be attributed to Sdc25p. For the first time, it was so possible to define the extent of cell-membrane exchange activity dependent on Sdc25p acting as a second yeast GEF. Genetic analysis has shown that the SDC25 gene can functionally complement a cdc25 mutation and that theSDC25 and CDC25 genes are differently transcribed, the former being expressed late during growth (8.Boy-Marcotte E. Ikonomi P. Jacquet M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 529-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The same K m and V max of membranes with overproduced Cdc25p or Sdc25p strongly suggests that the weaker activity of Sdc25p versus Cdc25p in native yeast membranes is related to a low level of expression.Sdc25p and Cdc25p are associated with the membrane via hydrophobic sequences located in the C-terminal region (7.Damak F. Boy-Marcotte E. Le-Roscouet D. Guilbaud R. Jacquet M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 202-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 48.Garreau H. Geymonat M. Renault G. Jacquet M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 86: 93-102Google Scholar). Membrane-associated overexpressed C-Cdc25p 877–1589 was found in this work to convert farnesylated Ras2p·GDP to the active state, as do membranes with intact Cdc25p or Sdc25p, but differently from these, it did not require farnesylation of Ras2p to stimulate the exchange activity. This shows that farnesylation is not involved in increasing the association of Ras2p with the cell membrane but favors specific protein-protein interactions. In fact, it is known that farnesylation is not sufficient for a stable anchoring of Ras to the plasma membrane, palmitoylation of the upstream cysteine being required (12.Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar, 13.Cadwallader K.A. Paterson H. Macdonald S.G. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell.

Our observations are suggestive for a function of the N-terminal domain regulating the activity of the catalytic domain as proposed in Ref. 49.Munder T. Küntzel H. FEBS Lett. 1989; 242: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar. Farnesylation of Ras could induce a topological orientation allowing the accessibility to the catalytic domain of Cdc25p, where the region 1374–1444 is essential for this interaction (50.Park W. Mosteller R.D. Broek D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8117-8122Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Evidence in vitro and in vivo has indicated that the N-terminal moiety of mammalian RasGEFs CDC25 Mm (38.Baouz S. Jacquet E. Bernardi A. Parmeggiani A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6671-6676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and SOS (51.Corbalan-Garcia S. Margarit S.M. Galron D. Yang S-S. Bar-Sagi D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 880-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) down-regulates the activity of the catalytic region, despite a modular organization fully different from the N-terminal region of Cdc25p or Sdc25p.Another relevant aspect of this work is the effect of Ha-Ras farnesylation on the response to GEF and adenylyl cyclase. As for Ras2p, farnesylation of Ha-Ras is required for a response to membrane-associated Cdc25p, but differently from Ras2p, unprenylated Ha-Ras is insensitive to membrane-associated C-Cdc25p 877–1589 and becomes as responsive as Ras2p only after fusion with the hypervariable region of Ras2p (residues 182–322). This demonstrates the essential role of this region for a productive interaction with the C-terminal domain of Cdc25p and disagrees with a suggested negative regulatory role of the C-terminal portion of Ras2p, which was proposed from the observation that Ras proteins lacking the C-terminal domain can bypasscdc25 mutations (52.Marshall M.S. Gibbs J.B. Scolnick E.M. Sigal I.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2309-2315Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We observed that purified C-Cdc25p can exert a GDP dissociating activity on Ha-Ras or Ha-Ras 1–173/Ras2p 307–322 even better than on Ras2p. These results show that with membrane-associated components protein interaction becomes subject to more selective constraints than with soluble components. Differently from region 8–181 (homologous to region 1–173 in Ha-ras) which is acidic, the hypervariable region 182–322 displays a highly positive net charge, that together with the presence of extensive hydrophobic stretches is likely essential for binding to membrane-associated GEF.Ha-Ras p21 was reported to be able to substitute for yeast Ras proteins in sustaining growth and adenylyl cyclase activation, but complementation of the defect of yeast Ras genes was not efficient (53.Broek D. Samiy N. Fasano O. Fujiyama A. Tamanoi F. Northup J. Wigler M. Cell. 1985; 41: 763-769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 54.Kataoka T. Powers S. Cameron S. Fasano O. Golfarb M. Broach J. Wigler M. Cell. 1985; 40: 19-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In our hands unprenylated recombinant Ha-Ras was practically unable to stimulate adenylyl cyclase and only its farnesylation enabled some stimulation. Even with farnesylated Ha-Ras maximum activation of adenylyl cyclase was much lower than with Ras2p, an effect that was more pronounced with wild-type adenylyl cyclase than with its CRI4 mutant. However, farnesylated Ha-Ras showed a strong affinity for both CRI4 and CYR1 gene products, almost as high as that of farnesylated Ras2p. In order to clarify the reasons for the functional differences, we extended the observations that an activated Ha-Ras Val-12/Ras2p chimaera containing the first 73 amino acids of Ha-Ras Val-12 stimulates adenylyl cyclase more efficiently than Ha-Ras (53.Broek D. Samiy N. Fasano O. Fujiyama A. Tamanoi F. Northup J. Wigler M. Cell. 1985; 41: 763-769Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). For this purpose, we constructed two N-terminal Ha-Ras/C-ter Ras2p chimaeras including C-terminal regions of Ras2p of different length (Ha-Ras 1–81/Ras2p 89–322 and Ha-Ras 1–173/Ras2p 182–322) comprising the extended hypervariable region of Ras2p. Both constructs revealed the same profile of adenylyl cyclase activation as Ras2p, thereby defining the hypervariable domain as an additional important element for full reconstitution of the activity. Other major determinants for the interaction with adenylyl cyclase are the effector region (residues 32–40 in Ha-Ras and 39–47 in Ras2p) (31.Fasano O. Créchet J.-B. De Vendittis E. Zahn R. Feger G.

By means of the CRI4-encoded product, which is highly sensitive to Ras2p even if unfarnesylated, we showed that maximum stimulation of adenylyl cyclase by unprenylated Ras2p or Ha-Ras/Ras2p chimaeras is identical to that obtained with prenylated Ras2p. This emphasizes the crucial role of the hypervariable region for maximum activation and shows that the major effect of farnesylation is to increase the affinity between Ras2p and adenylyl cyclase rather than to stimulate adenylyl cyclase activity.Even if there is still some uncertainty about a direct interaction between Ras proteins and adenylyl cyclase, due to the need of the adenylyl cyclase tightly associated protein CAP (60.Fedor-Chaiken M.R.

This interaction could induce a suitable conformation for maximum activation of the catalytic domain. Leucine-rich repeat regions (61.Field J. Vojtek A. Ballester R. Bolger G. Colicelli J.

However, as already reported for the wild-type CYR1 product (21.Kuroda Y. Suzuki N. Kataoka T. Science. 1993; 259: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), farnesylation of Ras2·GTP increases the affinity for adenylyl cyclase. Compared with the wild-type one, CRI4-adenylyl cyclase shows not only an increased sensitivity to Ras2p (26.Feger G. De Vendittis E. Vitelli A. Masturzo P. Zahn R. Verrotti A.C. Kavounis C. Pal G.P.

EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3657-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) but also a higher affinity for farnesylated Ras. One should stress that the differences between these two adenylyl cyclases are only quantitative.Adenylyl cyclase is not as strongly associated with the plasma membrane as Cdc25p and Sdc25p, does not contain a hydrophobic region resembling a membrane-spanning domain (64.Kataoka T. Broek D. Wigler M. Cell. 1985; 43: 493-505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar) and in ras1ras2bcy1 cells it is located in the soluble fraction (65.Engelberg D. Simchen G. Levitzki A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Overexpression of Cdc25p has been reported to translocate adenylyl cyclase to the membrane fraction (65.Engelberg D. Simchen G. Levitzki A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 641-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), while disruption of IRA1 gene dislocates it from the membrane (66.Mitts M. Bradshaw-Rouse J.R. Heideman W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4591-4598Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), indicating that both Cdc25p and Ira1p are involved in anchoring adenylyl cyclase to the membrane. A complex between the Cdc25p SH3 domain and adenylyl cyclase not mediated by CAP has been demonstrated (67.Freeman N.L. Lila T. Mintzer K.A. Chen Z. Pahk A.J. Ren R. Drubin D.G. Field J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 548-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Taken together these data suggest the existence in the cell of a large oligomeric complex including Cdc25p, Ira1p, and adenylyl cyclase. The association of Ras2p, Cdc25p, and adenylyl cyclase (68.Gross E. Marbach I. Engelberg D. Segal M. Simchen G. Levitzki A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2653-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) is further supported by this work highlighting the common function of the C-terminal hypervariable region of Ras2p and its farnesylation in promoting the interaction with and/or activation of membrane-bound Cdc25p and adenylyl cyclase. However, neither Cdc25p nor Sdc25p, even when overexpressed, are able to increase the affinity of farnesylated Ras2p for adenylyl cyclase.In conclusion, this work shows that the cellular localization of Ras2p, its regulators Cdc25p and Sdc25p and target adenylyl cyclase requires structural modifications that are dispensable under conditions of soluble purified components. We have highlighted the essential role of Ras2p farnesylation for GEF responsiveness and the involvement of its C-terminal hypervariable region in the interaction with Cdc25p. Compared with Ha-Ras, this region has been found to contain structural elements essential for the activation of adenylyl cyclase, the farnesylation facilitating this interaction. Ras proteins are GTPases cycling between the active GTP-bound state and the inactive GDP-bound state. They transmit extracellular signals that regulate cell growth and differentiation (1.Satoh T. Nakafuku M. Kaziro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24149-24152Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The level of activated Ras is controlled by the GTPase-activating protein and the GDP/GTP exchange factor (GEF)1 which in the case ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae are Ira1p/Ira2p (2.Buchberg A.M.

Ishikawa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2355-2359Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). One major difference between yeast and mammalian Ras proteins lies in their C-terminal hypervariable region which in the case of Ras from the former organism is much more extended (∼120 versus ∼20 aa residues). The function of this overextended C-terminal region is as yet unclear. Association with the cell membrane is an essential condition for the function of Ras proteins. Translocation of Ras to the inner surface of the membrane is promoted by sequential post-translational modifications of the C-terminal CAAX consensus box (10.Casey P.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The first step, the farnesylation of cysteine, is followed by proteolytic cleavage of the AAX peptide, methyl-esterification of the exposed isoprenylated cysteine and in the case of human N-Ras, Ha-Ras, andS. cerevisiae Ras1p and Ras2p, palmitoylation of one or two cysteines located upstream to the CAAX motif (11.Hancock J.F. Magee A.I. Childs J.E. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1989; 57: 1167-1177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1447) Google Scholar). After farnesylation, AAX proteolysis and methylation, Ras proteins are still mainly cytosolic; their tight association with the plasma membrane requires palmitoylation (12.Hancock J.F. Paterson H.

Chem. 1996; 271: 11541-11547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In mammalians, farnesylation was reported to be essential for the action of the ubiquitary exchange factor SOS (15.Porfiri E. Evans T. Chardin P. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22672-22677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); it targets Raf to the cell membrane (16.Marais R. Light Y. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6403-6407Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). In yeast farnesylation of Ras2p was found to be important for the interaction with the adenylyl cyclase-CAP complex (21.Kuroda Y. Suzuki N. Kataoka T. Science. 1993; 259: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 22.Shima F. Yamawaki-Kataoka Y. Yanagihara C. Tamada M. Okada T. Kariya K.I. Kataoka T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1057-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Information on the role of farnesylation in the activity of yeast Cdc25p and Sdc25p is so far limited to the observation that the isolated catalytic domain of Cdc25p promoted the nucleotide exchange on prenylated Ras and even more strongly on unprocessed Ras (15.Porfiri E.
