https://openalex.org/W1974981568,"Gas-phase clusters, which are weakly bound aggregates comprised of either atoms or molecules, often display properties that lie between those of the gaseous and condensed states. Interesting questions arise concerning how large a cluster must be before it will display bulk properties. Currently there is extensive research activity directed toward studies of their formation and varying properties and reactivity as a function of the degree of aggregation. Results serve to elucidate at the molecular level the course of change of a system to be followed from the gas to the condensed state, thereby enabling a spanning of the states of matter."
https://openalex.org/W2043211157,"The adaptability of laser-induced phonon spectroscopy to the determination of acoustic velocity and the equation of state in the diamond-anvil high-pressure cell is demonstrated. The technique provides a robust method for measurements at high pressure in both solids and liquids so that important problems in high-pressure elasticity and the earth sciences are now tractable. The velocity of sound and the density of methanol at 25 degrees C have been measured up to a pressure of 6.8 gigapascals. These results imply a higher density (by approximately 5 percent) for liquid methanol above 2.5 gigapascals than that given in existing compilations. The adiabatic bulk modulus increases by a factor of 50 at a maximum compression of 1.8. The thermodynamic Gr√ºneisen parameters of methanol and ethanol both increase with increasing pressure, in contrast to the behavior of most solids."
https://openalex.org/W2081096149,"In contrast to the diets of other cottid fishes and most teleosts, the diet of Asemichthys taylori is dominated by gastropod mollusks. Access to this underused prey appears to be made possible by morphological specializations of the neurocranium that allow Asemichthys to puncture the shells of its prey during mastication. Unpunched, the shell and operculum act as a barrier to digestion; more than 40% of the unpunched gastropods emerged alive in the feces. Asemichthys adjusted its punching behavior in an apparently adaptive way; other prey lacking such barriers to digestion were rarely punched. The ability of some shelled invertebrates to avoid digestion may make them less desirable as prey for many fishes that cannot masticate this kind of prey. The ability of shelled mollusks to survive in the digestive tracts of vertebrates may provide a dispersal mechanism for otherwise sedentary species."

On the basis of iridium concentrations in sediments from six deep-sea cores, the asteroid diameter was at least 0.5 kilometer; the impacting projectile may have been one of the largest in the last few million years. The stratigraphic age of this impact is the same as that inferred for the onset of Northern Hemisphere glaciation."
https://openalex.org/W2076067562,"The statistical techniques used by Raup and Sepkoski (1984 and 1986) to identify a 26-Myr periodicity in the biological extinction record for the past 250 Myr are reexamined, responding in detail to the criticisms of Stigler and Wagner (1987). It is argued that evaluation of a much larger set of extinction data using a time scale with 51 sampling intervals supports the finding of periodicity. In a reply by Sigler and Wagner, the preference for a 26-Myr period is attributed to a numerical quirk in the Harland et al. (1982) time scale, in which the subinterval boundaries are not linear interpolations between the stage boundaries but have 25-Myr periodicity. It is stressed that the results of the stringent statistical tests imposed do not disprove periodicity but rather indicate that the evidence and analyses presented so far are inadequate."

https://openalex.org/W2059129962,"A recent report that is a product of a process initiated and monitored by three major international organizations, the United Nations Environmental Program, the World Meteorological Organization, and the International Council of Scientific Unions, brings the greenhouse effect into the public eye. The report estimates rates of temperature increase of the earth due to CO/sub 2/ plus the other greenhouse gases. Estimates of the greenhouse effect arising from unrestrained gas emissions and a highly sensitive climate or strong global restraint of emissions and a low climate sensitivity range from 0.8 to 0.06/sup 0/C per decade. Long term policies that the report recommends should be reexamined are increased efficiency in the consumption of energy and a shift toward alternative energy to reduce CO/sub 2/ emissions and reforestation to remove CO/sub 2/ from the atmosphere."
