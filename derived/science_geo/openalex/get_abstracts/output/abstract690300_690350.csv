https://openalex.org/W4220714894,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) relay extracellular stimuli into specific cellular functions. Cells express many different GPCRs, but all these GPCRs signal to only a few second messengers such as cAMP. It is largely unknown how cells distinguish between signals triggered by different GPCRs to orchestrate their complex functions. Here, we demonstrate that individual GPCRs signal via receptor-associated independent cAMP nanodomains (RAINs) that constitute self-sufficient, independent cell signaling units. Low concentrations of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and isoproterenol exclusively generate highly localized cAMP pools around GLP-1- and β2-adrenergic receptors, respectively, which are protected from cAMP originating from other receptors and cell compartments. Mapping local cAMP concentrations with engineered GPCR nanorulers reveals gradients over only tens of nanometers that define the size of individual RAINs. The coexistence of many such RAINs allows a single cell to operate thousands of independent cellular signals simultaneously, rather than function as a simple ""on/off"" switch."
https://openalex.org/W4221048674,"Transmembrane β barrel proteins are folded into the outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria by the β barrel assembly machinery (BAM) via a poorly understood process that occurs without known external energy sources. Here, we used single-particle cryo-EM to visualize the folding dynamics of a model β barrel protein (EspP) by BAM. We found that BAM binds the highly conserved ""β signal"" motif of EspP to correctly orient β strands in the OM during folding. We also found that the folding of EspP proceeds via ""hybrid-barrel"" intermediates in which membrane integrated β sheets are attached to the essential BAM subunit, BamA. The structures show an unprecedented deflection of the membrane surrounding the EspP intermediates and suggest that β sheets progressively fold toward BamA to form a β barrel. Along with in vivo experiments that tracked β barrel folding while the OM tension was modified, our results support a model in which BAM harnesses OM elasticity to accelerate β barrel folding."
https://openalex.org/W4220864452,"Endothelial cells of blood vessels of the central nervous system (CNS) constitute blood-CNS barriers. Barrier properties are not intrinsic to these cells; rather they are induced and maintained by CNS microenvironment. Notably, the abluminal surfaces of CNS capillaries are ensheathed by pericytes and astrocytes. However, extrinsic factors from these perivascular cells that regulate barrier integrity are largely unknown. Here, we establish vitronectin, an extracellular matrix protein secreted by CNS pericytes, as a regulator of blood-CNS barrier function via interactions with its integrin receptor, α5, in endothelial cells. Genetic ablation of vitronectin or mutating vitronectin to prevent integrin binding, as well as endothelial-specific deletion of integrin α5, causes barrier leakage in mice. Furthermore, vitronectin-integrin α5 signaling maintains barrier integrity by actively inhibiting transcytosis in endothelial cells. These results demonstrate that signaling from perivascular cells to endothelial cells via ligand-receptor interactions is a key mechanism to regulate barrier permeability."

Here, we employed gene editing to find whether the mouse ortholog of the TDP43-regulated gene STMN2 has an important function in maintaining the motor system. Both mosaic founders and homozygous loss-of-function Stmn2 mice exhibited neuromuscular junction denervation and fragmentation, resulting in muscle atrophy and impaired motor behavior, accompanied by an imbalance in neuronal microtubule dynamics in the spinal cord. The introduction of human STMN2 through BAC transgenesis was sufficient to rescue the motor phenotypes observed in Stmn2 mutant mice. Collectively, our results demonstrate that disrupting the ortholog of a single TDP43-regulated RNA is sufficient to cause substantial motor dysfunction, indicating that disruption of TDP43 function is likely a contributor to ALS.

https://openalex.org/W4220695069,"The architecture whereby activity across many brain regions integrates to encode individual appetitive social behavior remains unknown. Here we measure electrical activity from eight brain regions as mice engage in a social preference assay. We then use machine learning to discover a network that encodes the extent to which individual mice engage another mouse. This network is organized by theta oscillations leading from prelimbic cortex and amygdala that converge on the ventral tegmental area. Network activity is synchronized with cellular firing, and frequency-specific activation of a circuit within this network increases social behavior. Finally, the network generalizes, on a mouse-by-mouse basis, to encode individual differences in social behavior in healthy animals but fails to encode individual behavior in a 'high confidence' genetic model of autism. Thus, our findings reveal the architecture whereby the brain integrates distributed activity across timescales to encode an appetitive brain state underlying individual differences in social behavior."
https://openalex.org/W4221112963,"NK-92 cells are an off-the-shelf, cell-based immunotherapy currently in clinical trials for a variety of cancer types. As the most 'NK-like' cell line available, it is also an important research tool. To date, NK-92 cells have been cultivated in a costly and time-consumingly prepared specialized medium, complicating research with these cells. Here we show that NK-92 cells grow in the comparatively user-friendly RPMI medium supplemented with IL-2. We demonstrate that their metabolic activity and replication rates are even improved in RPMI. Furthermore, they can be grown in cell culture dishes and do not need to be expanded in ventilated flasks. We show that in RPMI the cells retain functional characteristics relating to receptor expression, IFN-γ secretion, and killing. Our findings will enable more researchers to work with and manipulate this cell line, hopefully leading to further discoveries and improved therapies."
https://openalex.org/W4220929285,"Rubus idaeus L. (red raspberry), is a perennial woody plant species of the Rosaceae family that is widely cultivated in the temperate regions of world and is thus an economically important soft fruit species. It is prized for its flavour and aroma, as well as a high content of healthful compounds such as vitamins and antioxidants. Breeding programs exist globally for red raspberry, but variety development is a long and challenging process. Genomic and molecular tools for red raspberry are valuable resources for breeding. Here, a chromosome-length genome sequence assembly and related gene predictions for the red raspberry cultivar 'Anitra' are presented, comprising PacBio long read sequencing scaffolded using Hi-C sequence data. The assembled genome sequence totalled 291.7 Mbp, with 247.5 Mbp (84.8%) incorporated into seven sequencing scaffolds with an average length of 35.4 Mbp. A total of 39,448 protein-coding genes were predicted, 75% of which were functionally annotated. The seven chromosome scaffolds were anchored to a previously published genetic linkage map with a high degree of synteny and comparisons to genomes of closely related species within the Rosoideae revealed chromosome-scale rearrangements that have occurred over relatively short evolutionary periods. A chromosome-level genomic sequence of R. idaeus will be a valuable resource for the knowledge of its genome structure and function in red raspberry and will be a useful and important resource for researchers and plant breeders."
https://openalex.org/W4220757035,"Aim Our purpose was to clarify the level and correlates of empathy and altruism in the German population during the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods A nationally representative survey (n = 3,075) was conducted in August/September 2021. To measure empathy, a short scale based on the Interpersonality Reactivity Index (IRI; German version: Saarbrucken personality questionnaire, SPF) was used (SPF-K). Based on the International Personality Item Pool (IPIP; IPIP-5F30F-R1), the subscale altruism was used to quantify altruism. Results The average altruism score was 3.3 (SD: 0.7), ranging from 1 to 5. Moreover, the average empathy score was 13.1 (SD: 2.8), ranging from 4 to 20. The level of empathy significantly differed between the subgroups. For example, high levels of empathy were identified among women (average: 13.7, SD: 2.7), individuals with children (average: 13.5, SD: 2.8), and individuals with migration background (average: 13.6, SD: 2.8). Effect sizes were mostly small. Similar differences (in terms of effect size) were identified between these groups regarding altruism. Additionally, regressions showed that higher levels of both empathy and altruism were associated with being female, younger age, having children, sports activities and having at least one chronic disease. Moreover, vaccination against Covid-19 was only associated with higher altruism, but not with higher empathy. Conclusion Our study emphasized the moderately high level of empathy and altruism in Germany during times of the pandemic. Identifying the correlates of these factors may help to address individuals with very low levels of these factors."
https://openalex.org/W4220766524,"This study aimed to test two common explanations for the general finding of age-related changes in the performance of timing tasks within the millisecond-to-second range intervals. The first explanation is that older adults have a real difficulty in temporal processing as compared to younger adults. The second explanation is that older adults perform poorly on timing tasks because of their reduced cognitive control functions. These explanations have been mostly contrasted in explicit timing tasks that overtly require participants to process interval durations. Fewer studies have instead focused on implicit timing tasks, where no explicit instructions to process time are provided. Moreover, the investigation of both explicit and implicit timing in older adults has been restricted so far to healthy older participants. Here, a large sample (N = 85) comprising not only healthy but also pathological older adults completed explicit (time bisection) and implicit (foreperiod) timing tasks within a single session. Participants' age and cognitive decline, measured with the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), were used as continuous variables to explain performance on explicit and implicit timing tasks. Results for the explicit timing task showed a flatter psychometric curve with increasing age or decreasing MMSE scores, pointing to a deficit at the level of cognitive control functions rather than of temporal processing. By contrast, for the implicit timing task, a decrease in the MMSE scores was associated with a reduced foreperiod effect, an index of implicit time processing. Overall, these findings extend previous studies on explicit and implicit timing in healthy aged samples by dissociating between age and cognitive decline (in the normal-to-pathological continuum) in older adults."
https://openalex.org/W4220912131,"18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET/CT is recommended for evaluation of intermediate-risk indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs). While highly sensitive, the specificity of FDG remains suboptimal for differentiating malignant from benign nodules, particularly in areas where fungal lung diseases are prevalent. Thus, a cancer-specific imaging probe is greatly needed. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a PET radiotracer (S)-4-(3-[18F]-fluoropropyl)-L-glutamic acid (FSPG) improves the diagnostic accuracy of IPNs compared to 18F-FDG PET/CT.This study was conducted at a major academic medical center and an affiliated VA medical center. Twenty-six patients with newly discovered IPNs 7-30mm diameter or newly diagnosed lung cancer completed serial PET/CT scans utilizing 18F-FDG and 18F-FSPG, without intervening treatment of the lesion. The scans were independently reviewed by two dual-trained diagnostic radiology and nuclear medicine physicians. Characteristics evaluated included quantitative SUVmax values of the pulmonary nodules and metastases.A total of 17 out of 26 patients had cancer and 9 had benign lesions. 18F-FSPG was negative in 6 of 9 benign lesions compared to 7 of 9 with 18F-FDG. 18F-FSPG and 18F-FDG were positive in 14 of 17 and 12 of 17 malignant lesions, respectively. 18F-FSPG detected brain and intracardiac metastases missed by 18F-FDG PET in one case, while 18F-FDG detected a metastasis to the kidney missed by 18F-FSPG.In this pilot study, there was no significant difference in overall diagnostic accuracy between 18F-FSPG and 18F-FDG for the evaluation of IPNs and staging of lung cancer. Additional studies will be needed to determine the clinical utility of this tracer in the management of IPNs and lung cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4221112706,"The prevalence, incidence and risk factors of atrial fibrillation (AF) in a large, geographically and ethnically diverse cohort in the United States have not been fully described.We analyzed data from 173,099 participants of the All of Us Research Program recruited in the period 2017-2019, with 92,318 of them having electronic health records (EHR) data available, and 35,483 having completed a medical history survey. Presence of AF at baseline was identified from self-report and EHR records. Incident AF was obtained from EHR. Demographic, anthropometric and clinical risk factors were obtained from questionnaires, baseline physical measurements and EHR.At enrollment, mean age was 52 years old (range 18-89). Females and males accounted for 61% and 39% respectively. Non-Hispanic Whites accounted for 67% of participants, with non-Hispanic Blacks, non-Hispanic Asians and Hispanics accounting for 26%, 4% and 3% of participants, respectively. Among 92,318 participants with available EHR data, 3,885 (4.2%) had AF at the time of study enrollment, while the corresponding figure among 35,483 with medical history data was 2,084 (5.9%). During a median follow-up of 16 months, 354 new cases of AF were identified among 88,433 eligible participants. Individuals who were older, male, non-Hispanic white, had higher body mass index, or a prior history of heart failure or coronary heart disease had higher prevalence and incidence of AF.The epidemiology of AF in the All of Us Research Program is similar to that reported in smaller studies with careful phenotyping, highlighting the value of this new resource for the study of AF and, potentially, other cardiovascular diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4220764686,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are major health issues associated with the metabolic syndrome. Although NASH is a known risk factor of CKD, the mechanisms linking these two diseases remain poorly understood. We aimed to investigate alterations in the kidney complicated with dyslipidemia in an established NASH mouse model. Male C57BL6/J mice were fed with control diet or high-fat diet (HFD), containing 40% fat, 22% fructose, and 2% cholesterol for 16 weeks. Metabolic characteristics, histological changes in the kidney, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, apoptosis, and fibrosis were evaluated by histological analysis, immunoblotting, and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Levels of serum aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkali-phosphatase, total cholesterol, and urinary albumin were significantly higher in mice fed with HFD. Remarkable steatosis, glomerular hypertrophy, and interstitial fibrosis were also shown in in the kidney by leveraging HFD. Furthermore, HFD increased the mRNA expression levels of Casp3, Tgfb1, and Nfe2l2 and the protein level of BiP. We observed the early changes of CKD and speculate that the underlying mechanisms that link CKD and NASH are the induction of ER stress and apoptosis. Further, we observed the activation of Nfe2l2 in the steatosis-induced CKD mouse model. This NASH model holds implications in investigating the mechanisms linking dyslipidemia and CKD."
https://openalex.org/W4220894503,"Post-partum family planning is a novel strategy to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality by preventing unwanted pregnancy and unsafe abortion. However, little was done on community-based design to assess modern contraceptive use during an extended postpartum period in southern Ethiopia. Therefore, this study aimed to assess modern contraceptive use during extended postpartum period and factors associated among women who gave birth in the previous twelve months in southern Ethiopia.A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 416 women in Arba Minch town. A systematic random sampling technique was employed to select the enrolled women. Data were collected using a structured and pretested questionnaire. The data were entered into Epi-Data version 4.6 then exported to statically package of social science (SPSS) version 25 for data analysis.Among enrolled postpartum women, 64.7% were used modern contraceptives for the last 12 months. Women were more likely to use a modern contraceptive during the extended period of postpartum if they resumed sexual intercourse (AOR:7.4 [4.08, 13.23]), received post-partum family planning counseling (AOR: 3.2 [1.95, 5.28]), and if they resumed menses (AOR: 5.3 [3.12, 9.15]) than the counterpart. Being young age women (AOR: 3.2 [1.05, 9.82]) compared to age above 35 years and married (AOR:3.2 [1.17-10.28]) compared to currently unmarried were significantly associated factors for modern contraceptive use during the extended period of postpartum.The level of modern contraceptive utilization during the extended postpartum period was satisfactory. Therefore, in light of this finding, there is a need to improve the strengthening and scale-up antenatal and postnatal counseling of contraceptive use during the extended postpartum period, advice on preceding the return of menses, and give better attention for older age and unmarried women education on family planning."
https://openalex.org/W4221004373,"This study aimed to examine social gradients in ADHD during late childhood (age 9-11 years) using absolute and relative relationships with socioeconomic status exposure (household income, maternal education) during early childhood (<5 years) in seven cohorts from six industrialised countries (UK, Australia, Canada, The Netherlands, USA, Sweden).Secondary analyses were conducted for each birth cohort. Risk ratios, pooled risk estimates, and absolute inequality, measured by the Slope Index of Inequality (SII), were estimated to quantify social gradients in ADHD during late childhood by household income and maternal education measured during early childhood. Estimates were adjusted for child sex, mother age at birth, mother ethnicity, and multiple births.All cohorts demonstrated social gradients by household income and maternal education in early childhood, except for maternal education in Quebec. Pooled risk estimates, relating to 44,925 children, yielded expected gradients (income: low 1.83(CI 1.38,2.41), middle 1.42(1.13,1.79), high (reference); maternal education: low 2.13(1.39,3.25), middle 1.42(1.13,1.79)). Estimates of absolute inequality using SII showed that the largest differences in ADHD prevalence between the highest and lowest levels of maternal education were observed in Australia (4% lower) and Sweden (3% lower); for household income, the largest differences were observed in Quebec (6% lower) and Canada (all provinces: 5% lower).Findings indicate that children in families with high household income or maternal education are less likely to have ADHD at age 9-11. Absolute inequality, in combination with relative inequality, provides a more complete account of the socioeconomic status and ADHD relationship in different high-income countries. While the study design precludes causal inference, the linear relation between early childhood social circumstances and later ADHD suggests a potential role for policies that promote high levels of education, especially among women, and adequate levels of household income over children's early years in reducing risk of later ADHD."
https://openalex.org/W4220820558,"As youth e-cigarette use has surged in the last several years, teachers and school administrators have reported challenges addressing student use of emerging e-cigarette products on school property. While federal policy prohibits smoking in U.S. schools that receive federal funding, school e-cigarette bans only exist where states or localities have acted. Little is known about school staff experiences with implementing these relatively new policies; this study examines associations between school e-cigarette policies and trainings on school staff awareness and intervention on student e-cigarette use.A national convenience sample of 1,526 U.S. middle- and high-school teachers and administrators was surveyed in November-December 2018. Among respondents who provided their job title and indicated that they worked in a school rather than a district (n = 1,480, response rate = 97.0%), separate logistic regressions examine associations of school policies and policy training with e-cigarette awareness and intervention on student e-cigarette use.Despite being the most popular e-cigarette at the time, fewer than half (47.5%) of respondents identified an image of a JUUL device as an e-cigarette. However, respondents reporting the presence of e-cigarette policies in their schools had higher odds of recognizing e-cigarettes (OR = 3.85, p<0.01), including photo recognition of JUUL (OR = 1.90, p<0.001). Respondents reporting e-cigarette policies also had higher odds of reporting intervention on student e-cigarette use (communicating with students about e-cigarette avoidance: OR = 2.32, p<0.001; reporting students had been caught using e-cigarettes at school: OR = 1.54, p<0.05). Among respondents reporting a school e-cigarette policy, those trained on the policy had higher odds of JUUL photo recognition (OR = 1.54, p<0.01). Respondents trained on e-cigarette policies also had higher odds of reporting intervention (communicating: OR = 3.89, p<0.001; students caught using e-cigarettes: OR = 2.71, p<0.001).As new tobacco products enter the market, school policies may be important tools to raise school personnel awareness of and intervention on emerging e-cigarette product use. However, policy adoption alone is not sufficient; policy training may further aid in recognition and intervention upon student use of e-cigarettes at school."
https://openalex.org/W4220833823,"Osteoporosis is an increasing health problem in postmenopausal women. Our findings indicated that long-term brisk walking with a volume greater than 16 per week is effective for improving BMD in premenopausal women.To examine the effects of brisk walking on bone mineral density (BMD) in premenopausal women, and further determine the effective frequency, intensity, time and volume (frequency x duration) of brisk walking for training strategy prescription.222 healthy premenopausal women were recruited for BMD measurement. According to the survey of their physical activity level, 84 subjects (age: 46±1.8) whose physical activity index ≥40 were categorized into the brisk walking group, and 138 subjects (age: 47±2.2) whose physical activity index <40 were assigned to the sedentary group. The BMD of these two groups were statistically compared with an independent t test. Next, 35 subjects from the original sedentary group were recruited for BMD measurement after 2-year moderate brisk walking. According to the volume of physical activity per week, they were divided into the control group (n = 10, aged 49±0.9), volume 8 group (n = 4, aged 48±1.2), volume 12 group (n = 7, aged 49±1.4), volume 16 group (n = 8, aged 49±1.3), and volume 20 group (n = 6, aged 49±1.5). ANOVA was used to analyze BMD before and after brisk walking among the five groups.The BMD in the brisk walking group (1.00±0.008 g/cm2) was significantly higher than that in the sedentary group (0.89±0.008 g/cm2) (P<0.001). Stepwise regression analysis revealed that the volume of brisk walking was significantly correlated with BMD (P<0.001). In particular, brisk walking with a volume greater than 16 (a score of duration up to 4 and a score of frequency up to 4 or 5) per week is effective for improving BMD in premenopausal women (P = 0.03, P = 0.002, respectively).Long-term brisk walking is an efficient way to improve BMD. Taking brisk walks for 30 minutes per day 3 or more times per week (volume>16) is recommended to prevent bone loss in premenopausal women."
https://openalex.org/W4220944683,"As people, animals and materials are transported across increasingly large distances in a globalized world, threats to our biosecurity and food security are rising. Aotearoa New Zealand is an island nation with many endemic species, a strong local agricultural industry, and a need to protect these from pest threats, as well as the economy from fraudulent commodities. Mitigation of such threats is much more effective if their origins and pathways for entry are understood. We propose that this may be addressed in Aotearoa using strontium isotope analysis of both pests and products. Bioavailable radiogenic isotopes of strontium are ubiquitous markers of provenance that are increasingly used to trace the origin of animals and plants as well as products, but currently a baseline map across Aotearoa is lacking, preventing use of this technique. Here, we have improved an existing methodology to develop a regional bioavailable strontium isoscape using the best available geospatial datasets for Aotearoa. The isoscape explains 53% of the variation (R 2 = 0.53 and RMSE = 0.00098) across the region, for which the primary drivers are the underlying geology, soil pH, and aerosol deposition (dust and sea salt). We tested the potential of this model to determine the origin of cow milk produced across Aotearoa. Predictions for cow milk (n = 33) highlighted all potential origin locations that share similar 87 Sr/ 86 Sr values, with the closest predictions averaging 7.05 km away from their true place of origin. These results demonstrate that this bioavailable strontium isoscape is effective for tracing locally produced agricultural products in Aotearoa. Accordingly, it could be used to certify the origin of Aotearoa’s products, while also helping to determine if new pest detections were of locally breeding populations or not, or to raise awareness of imported illegal agricultural products."
https://openalex.org/W4221080452,"Conserved IncI1 and IncHI1 plasmids carrying blaCTX-M-1 have been found circulating in chickens and horses from continental Europe, respectively. In Canada, blaCTX-M-1 is overwhelmingly the most common blaCTX-M variant found in Escherichia coli from chicken and horses and can be recovered at lower frequencies in swine, cattle, and dogs. Whole-genome sequencing has identified a large genetic diversity of isolates carrying this variant, warranting further investigations into the plasmids carrying this gene. Therefore, the objective of this study was to describe the genetic profiles of blaCTX-M-1 plasmids circulating in E. coli from Canadian domestic animals and compare them to those recovered in animals in Europe. Fifty-one blaCTX-M-1 positive E. coli isolates from chicken (n = 14), horses (racetrack horses n = 11; community horses n = 3), swine (n = 7), turkey (n = 6), dogs (n = 5), beef cattle (n = 3), and dairy cattle (n = 2) were selected for plasmid characterization. Sequences were obtained through both Illumina and Oxford Nanopore technologies. Genomes were assembled using either Unicycler hybrid assembly or Flye with polishing performed using Pilon. blaCTX-M-1 was found residing on a plasmid in 45 isolates and chromosomally located in six isolates. A conserved IncI1/ST3 plasmid was identified among chicken (n = 12), turkey (n = 4), swine (n = 6), dog (n = 2), and beef cattle (n = 2) isolates. When compared against publicly available data, these plasmids showed a high degree of similarity to those identified in isolates from poultry and swine in Europe. These results suggest that an epidemic IncI1/ST3 plasmid similar to the one found in Europe is contributing to the spread of blaCTX-M-1 in Canada. A conserved IncHI1/FIA(HI1)/ST2 plasmid was also recovered from nearly all racetrack horse isolates (n = 10). Although IncHI1/ST2 plasmids have been reported among European horse isolates, IncHI1/ST9 plasmids appear to be more widespread. Further studies are necessary to understand the factors contributing to these plasmids' success in their respective populations."
https://openalex.org/W4221105645,"ε-Poly- l -lysine (ε-PL) is a natural antimicrobial polymer with significant inhibitory activity against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, and nowadays used widely as a preservative in the food industry. In the present study, ε-PL broth was obtained from Streptomyces ahygroscopicus GIM8 fermentation in a nutrient-limited liquid medium. The in vitro antifungal activity of the broth against fruit pathogens Penicillium expansum and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was investigated, and its usage for postharvest storage of two highly perishable fruits wax apple and guava was evaluated. Results showed that ε-PL concentration in the broth reached 0.61 g/L, and the nutrition level of the broth was low. The antifungal activity of ε-PL broth was comparable to that of the aqueous solution of ε-PL under the same concentration. Immersion with the diluted broth (200 mg/L ε-PL) markedly delayed the decline in the quality of postharvest wax apple and guava fruits during storage, and the decay incidences were also greatly decreased as compared to their respective controls (distilled water immersion). A further investigation demonstrated that the ε-PL broth immersion induced an increase in the activity of defense-related enzymes peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase in the two fruits during storage. The present study proved that the fermentation broth of ε-PL could be used as a promising alternative to high purity ε-PL and synthetic fungicides for preserving fruits at postharvest stage."
https://openalex.org/W4226206091,"Isolation is an indispensable measure to contain the SARS-CoV-2 virus, but it may have a negative impact on mental health and overall wellbeing. Evidence on the isolation experience, facilitating and complicating factors is needed to mitigate negative effects.This observational, population-based cohort study enrolled 1547 adults from the general population with SARS-CoV-2 infection reported to authorities between 27 February 2020 and 19 January 2021 in Zurich, Switzerland. We assessed the proportion of individuals reporting symptoms of depression and anxiety before, during and after isolation (by DASS-21), and queried worries, positive experiences, and difficulties. We analyzed the association of these outcomes with socio-demographics using ordinal regression. Additionally, we report free-text statements by participants to capture most important aspects of isolation. The proportion of participants affected by depression or anxiety increased during isolation from 10·0% to 17·1% and 9·1% to 17·6%, respectively. Ordinal regression showed that taking care of children increased the difficulty of isolation (OR 2·10, CI 1·43-3·08) and risk of non-compliance (OR 1·63, CI 1·05-2·53), especially in younger participants. A facilitating factor that individuals commonly expressed was receiving more support during isolation.Isolation due to SARS-CoV-2 presents a mental burden, especially for younger individuals and those taking care of children. Public health authorities need to train personnel and draw from community-based resources to provide targeted support, information, and guidance to individuals during isolation. Such efforts could alleviate the negative impact isolation has on the mental and physical health of individuals and ensure compliance of the population with recommendations."
https://openalex.org/W4221016003,"Real-time communication, unlimited distribution of information, and the lack of editorial supervision in social media communication aggravate recipients' credibility evaluations and information selection by what aspects of the source such as expertise have emerged as important anchors for evaluations. It has long been assumed that credibility judgments in social media are specifically guided by heuristics. However, the existing studies merely give indications, for example, based on individuals' self-report but do not test whether important attributes and prerequisites of heuristic decision-making, such as effort reduction, are present. Against this background, the current study (N = 185) analyses by applying a reduced two-alternative choice paradigm whether the relation between the expertise cue and credibility judgments and the choice of information sources is guided by a heuristic, namely the expertise heuristic. Findings indicate that the presence of the expertise cue reduced respondents' task latencies significantly, although participants' decision behavior was not independent from additional information. This is discussed in detail with recourse to theoretical conceptualizations of cognitive heuristics."
https://openalex.org/W4221035285,"It remains unclear whether neurobehavioral testing adds significant information to histologic assessment of experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI) and if automated gait assessment using the CatWalk XT®, while shown to be effective in in the acute phase, is also effective in the chronic phase after experimental TBI. Therefore, we evaluated the correlation of CatWalk XT® parameters with histologic lesion volume and analyzed their temporal and spatial patterns over four weeks after trauma induction.C57Bl/6 mice were subjected to controlled cortical impact (CCI). CatWalk XT® analysis was performed one day prior to surgery and together with the histological evaluation of lesion volume on postoperative days one, three, seven, 14 and 28. Temporal and spatial profiles of gait impairment were analyzed and a total of 100 CatWalk XT® parameters were correlated to lesion size.While in the first week after CCI, there was significant impairment of nearly all CatWalk XT® parameters, impairment of paw prints, intensities and dynamic movement parameters resolved thereafter; however, impairment of dynamic single paw parameters persisted up to four weeks. Correlation of the CatWalk XT® parameters with lesion volume was poor at all timepoints.As CatWalk XT® parameters do not correlate with focal lesion size after CCI, gait assessment using the CatWalk XT® might add valuable information to solitary histologic evaluation of the injury site. While all CatWalk XT® parameters can be used for gait assessments in the first week after CCI, dynamic single paw parameters might be more relevant in the chronic phase after experimental TBI."
https://openalex.org/W4221039100,"Introduction Diarrhoeal diseases are common among children and older adults. Yet, majority of the scientific studies deal with children, neglecting the other vulnerable and growing proportion of the population–the older adults. Therefore, the present study aims to find rural-urban differentials in the prevalence of diarrhoea among older adults in India and its states. Additionally, the study aims to find the correlates of diarrhoea among older adults in India. The study hypothesizes that there are no differences in the prevalence of diarrhoea in rural and urban areas. Methods Data for this study was utilized from the recent Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (2017–18). The present study included eligible respondents aged 60 years and above (N = 31,464). Descriptive statistics along with bivariate analysis was presented to reveal the preliminary results. In addition, binary logistic regression analysis was used to fulfil the study objectives. Results About 15% of older adults reported that they suffered from diarrhoea in the last two years. The prevalence of diarrhoea among older adults was found to be highest in Mizoram (33.5 per cent), followed by Chhattisgarh (30.7 per cent) and Bihar (30.2 per cent). There were significant rural-urban differences in the prevalence of diarrhoea among older adults in India (difference: 7.7 per cent). The highest rural-urban differences in the prevalence of diarrhoea were observed among older adults who were 80+ years old (difference: 13.6 per cent), used unimproved toilet facilities (difference: 12.7 per cent), lived in the kutcha house (difference: 10.2 per cent), and those who used unclean source of cooking fuel (difference: 9 per cent). Multivariate results show that the likelihood of diarrhoea was 17 per cent more among older adults who were 80+ years compared to those who belonged to 60–69 years’ age group [AOR: 1.17; CI: 1.04–1.32]. Similarly, the older female had higher odds of diarrhoea than their male counterparts [AOR: 1.19; CI: 1.09–1.30]. The risk of diarrhoea had declined with the increase in the educational level of older adults. The likelihood of diarrhoea was significantly 32 per cent more among older adults who used unimproved toilet facilities than those who used improved toilet facilities [AOR: 1.32; CI: 1.21–1.45]. Similarly, older adults who used unimproved drinking water sources had higher odds of diarrhoea than their counterparts [AOR: 1.45; CI: 1.25–1.69]. Moreover, older adults who belonged to urban areas were 22 per cent less likely to suffer from diarrhoea compared to those who belonged to rural areas [AOR: 0.88; CI: 0.80–0.96]. Conclusion The findings of this study reveal that diarrhoea is a major health problem among older adults in India. There is an immediate need to address this public health concern by raising awareness about poor sanitation and unhygienic practices. With the support of the findings of the present study, policy makers can design interventions for reducing the massive burden of diarrhoea among older adults in rural India."
https://openalex.org/W4226088230,"Introduction Bile duct integrity is essential for the maintenance of the structure and function of the biliary tree. We previously showed that cholangiocyte injury in a toxic model of biliary atresia leads to increased monolayer permeability. Increased epithelial permeability was also shown in other cholangiopathies. We hypothesized that after initial cholangiocyte injury, leakage of bile acids into the duct submucosa propagates cholangiocyte damage and fibrosis. We thus aimed to determine the impact of bile acid exposure on cholangiocytes and the potential therapeutic effect of a non-toxic bile acid. Materials and methods Extrahepatic bile duct explants were isolated from adult and neonatal BALB/c mice. Explants were cultured with or without glycochenodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid. They were then fixed and stained. Results Explants treated with glycochenodeoxycholic acid demonstrated cholangiocyte injury with monolayer disruption and partial lumen obstruction compared to control ducts. Masson’s trichrome stains revealed increased collagen fibers. Myofibroblast marker α-SMA stains were significantly elevated in the periductal region. The addition of ursodeoxycholic acid resulted in decreased cholangiocyte injury and reduced fibrosis. Conclusions Bile acid leakage into the submucosa after initial cholangiocyte injury may serve as a possible mechanism of disease propagation and progressive fibrosis in cholangiopathies."
https://openalex.org/W4220780109,"Using data from the China Education Panel Survey (CEPS), this study empirically examines the association between internal migration and child health through an investigation of health disparities between migrant children and left-behind children in China. The results show that, in comparison with being left behind, migrating with parents significantly improves children's self-reported health, height-for-age z-score (HAZ) and BMI-for-age z-score (BAZ), and reduces their frequency of sickness. These findings remain robust to a suite of robustness checks. Furthermore, the health effects of internal migration are more prominent for children with a rural hukou compared with urban ones. Although migrant children are more likely to experience teacher discrimination, they have higher levels of parental care, family relationships, and peer relationships relative to their left-behind counterparts, which indicates possible mechanisms behind the association between children's migration and health. Our findings underline the importance of policy improvement and evidence-based interventions aiming at reducing involuntary parent-child separation and facilitating the development in health of disadvantaged children in developing countries like China."
https://openalex.org/W4220817518,"Background Interventions to change health professionals’ behaviour are often difficult to replicate. Incomplete reporting is a key reason and a source of waste in health research. We aimed to assess the reporting of shared decision making (SDM) interventions. Methods We extracted data from a 2017 Cochrane systematic review whose aim was to determine the effectiveness of interventions to increase the use of SDM by healthcare professionals. In a secondary analysis, we used the 12 items of the Template for Intervention Description and Replication (TIDieR) checklist to analyze quantitative data. We used a conceptual framework for implementation fidelity to analyze qualitative data, which added details to various TIDieR items (e.g. under “what materials?” we also reported on ease of access to materials). We used SAS 9.4 for all analyses. Results Of the 87 studies included in the 2017 Cochrane review, 83 were randomized trials, three were non-randomized trials, and one was a controlled before-and-after study. Items most completely reported were: “brief name” (87/87, 100%), “why” (rationale) (86/87, 99%), and “what” (procedures) (81/87, 93%). The least completely reported items (under 50%) were “materials” (29/87, 33%), “who” (23/87, 26%), and “when and how much” (18/87, 21%), as well as the conditional items: “tailoring” (8/87, 9%), “modifications” (3/87, 4%), and “how well (actual)” (i.e. delivered as planned?) (3/87, 3%). Interventions targeting patients were better reported than those targeting health professionals or both patients and health professionals, e.g. 84% of patient-targeted intervention studies reported “How”, (delivery modes), vs. 67% for those targeting health professionals and 32% for those targeting both. We also reported qualitative analyses for most items. Overall reporting of items for all interventions was 41.5%. Conclusions Reporting on all groups or components of SDM interventions was incomplete in most SDM studies published up to 2017. Our results provide guidance for authors on what elements need better reporting to improve the replicability of their SDM interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4221002741,"Mechanically stressed vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) have potential roles in the development of vascular complications. However, the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Using VSMCs cultured from rat thoracic aorta explants, we investigated the effects of mechanical stretch (MS) on the cellular secretion of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), a major damage-associated molecular pattern that mediates vascular complications in stressed vasculature. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) demonstrated an increase in the secretion of HMGB1 in VSMCs stimulated with MS (0–3% strain, 60 cycles/min), and this secretion was markedly and time-dependently increased at 3% MS. The increased secretion of HMGB1 at 3% MS was accompanied by an increased cytosolic translocation of nuclear HMGB1; the acetylated and phosphorylated forms of this protein were significantly increased. Among various inhibitors of membrane receptors mediating mechanical signals, AG1295 (a platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) inhibitor) attenuated MS-induced HMGB1 secretion. Inhibitors of other receptors, including epidermal growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, and fibroblast growth factor receptors, did not inhibit this secretion. Additionally, MS-induced HMGB1 secretion was markedly attenuated in PDGFR-β-deficient cells but not in cells transfected with PDGFR-α siRNA. Likewise, PDGF-DD, but not PDGF-AA, directly increased HMGB1 secretion in VSMCs, indicating a pivotal role of PDGFR-β signaling in the secretion of this protein in VSMCs. Thus, targeting PDGFR-β-mediated secretion of HMGB1 in VSMCs might be a promising therapeutic strategy for vascular complications associated with hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W4221016489,"Compelling evidence supports the current international recommendation of at least 150 min/week of leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) during pregnancy. However, the potential relationship between LTPA and birth weight (BW) remains unclear in low- and middle-income countries. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between LTPA during pregnancy and offspring BW in an Amazonian population. Prospective cohort study was carried-out with 500 pregnant women and their offspring followed-up in the MINA-Brazil study, which was conducted in Cruzeiro do Sul, Western Brazilian Amazon. LTPA was assessed in the second (mean 19.6, SD 2.4 weeks) and third (mean 27.8, SD 1.6 weeks) gestational trimesters by a standardised interview and categorised according to the recommended cut-off of at least 150 min/week. We calculated offspring BW z-scores by sex and gestational age. We then explored the effect of LTPA during pregnancy on offspring BW, the association between LTPA and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) or large-for-gestational-age (LGA) births, and the mediating role of excessive and insufficient gestational weight gain (GWG). At least 150 min/week of LTPA during the third gestational trimester was associated with an offspring BW decrease of -0.35 z-score (95% CI: -0.65, -0.05) or -147.9 grams (95% CI: -260.9, -14.8), without increasing the frequency of SGA foetuses either in the second or third gestational trimester (p > 0.05). Excessive GWG mediated the effect of LTPA on the offspring BW (indirect effect = -0.05 z-score [95% CI: -0.10, -0.00] or -34.7 grams (95% CI: -66.1, -3.3]). This mediation effect was not observed for insufficient GWG. LTPA in the third, but not in the second, trimester of pregnancy was inversely associated with offspring BW without increasing the frequency of SGA, an effect that was partly mediated by excessive GWG."

https://openalex.org/W4225487593,"The absence of a chronic kidney disease (CKD) registry in Ecuador makes it difficult to assess the burden of disease, but there is an anticipated increase in the incidence of CKD along with increasing diabetes, hypertension and population age. From 2012, augmented funding for renal replacement therapy expanded dialysis clinics and patient coverage. We conducted 73 in-depth sociological interviews with healthcare providers in eight provinces and collected quantitative epidemiological data on patients with CKD diagnoses from six national-level databases between 2015 and 2018. Datasets show a total of 17,484 dialysis patients in 2018, or 567 patients per million population (pmp), with an annual cost exceeding 11% of Ecuador's public health budget. Each year, there were 139-162 pmp new dialysis patients, while doctors reported waiting lists. The number of patients on peritoneal dialysis was static; those on hemodialysis increased over time. Only 13 of 24 provinces were found to have dialysis services, and nephrologists were clustered in major cities, which limits access, delays medical attention, and adds a travel burden on patients. Prevention and screening programs are scarce, while hospitalization is an important reality for CKD patients. CKD is an emerging public health crisis that has increased dramatically over the last decade in Ecuador and is expected to continue, making coverage for all patients impossible and the current structure, unsustainable. A patient registry would help health policymakers and administrators estimate the demand and progression of patients with consideration for comorbidities, disease stage, requirements and costs, mortality and follow-up. This should be used to help identify where to focus prevention and improved treatment efforts. Organized monitoring of CKD patients would benefit from improvements in patient referral. Community-based education and prevention programs, the strengthening of primary healthcare capacity (including basic routine tests) and improved nephrology services are also urgently needed."
https://openalex.org/W3161266176,"Using the synthetic control method, we construct counterfactuals for what would have happened if Sweden had imposed a lockdown during the first wave of the COVID-19 epidemic. We consider eight different indicators, including a novel one that we construct by adjusting recorded daily COVID-19 deaths to account for weakly excess mortality. Correcting for data problems and re-optimizing the synthetic control for each indicator, we find that a lockdown would have had sizable effects within one week. The much longer delay estimated by two previous studies focusing on the number of positives cases is mainly driven by the extremely low testing frequency that prevailed in Sweden in the first months of the epidemic. This result appears relevant for choosing the timing of future lockdowns and highlights the importance of looking at several indicators to derive robust conclusions. We also find that our novel indicator is effective in correcting errors in the COVID-19 deaths series and that the quantitative effects of the lockdown are stronger than previously estimated."
https://openalex.org/W4220661388,"The heme component of myoglobin plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of rhabdomyolysis-associated acute kidney injury (RM-AKI). Heme oxiganenase-1 (HO-1) is the rate-limiting enzyme of heme catabolism, and its metabolites, iron, biliverdin, and carbon monoxide, have antioxidant properties. Tin chloride (SnCl2) is a kidney specific HO-1 inducer. In this study, we examined whether the induction of HO-1 in the kidney by SnCl₂ pretreatment ameliorates RM-AKI in rats and if the effect is due to the degradation of excess renal free heme. We developed an RM-AKI rat (male Sprague-Dawley rats) model by injecting glycerol (Gly) in the hind limbs. RM-AKI rats were pretreated with saline or SnCl₂ or additional SnMP (tin mesoporphyrin, a specific HO inhibitor) followed by Gly treatment. Serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine (Crea) were measured as indicators of renal function. Renal free heme level was assessed based on the levels of δ-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS1), a heme biosynthetic enzyme, and nuclear BTB and CNC homology 1 (Bach1), an inhibitory transcription factor of HO-1. Elevated free heme levels lead to decreases in ALAS1 and nuclear Bach1. After 24 h of Gly injection, serum BUN and Crea levels in saline-pretreated rats were significantly higher than those in untreated control rats. In contrast, SnCl₂-pretreated rats showed no significant increase in the indices. However, additional treatment of SnMP abolished the beneficial effect of SnCl₂. Renal ALAS1 mRNA levels and renal nuclear Bach1 protein levels in the saline pretreated rats were significantly lower than those in control rats 3 h after Gly injection. In contrast, the levels in SnCl₂-pretreated rats were not altered. The findings indicate that SnCl2 pretreatment confers protection against RM-AKI by virtue of HO-1 induction in the renal system, at least in part through excess free heme degradation."

We also sought to investigate the factors that may have influenced the changes in survival rate.We retrospectively analyzed 17,776 breast cancer patients who were treated at Asan Medical Center between January 2000 and December 2013. Patient information was collected from the Asan database, including age at diagnosis, clinical manifestation, pathology report, types of treatment and modality, types of recurrence, and follow-up period. We classified the patients into two cohorts according to the year of their surgery (P1: 2000-2007 and P2: 2008-2013) and compared survival and recurrence between both cohorts.We observed that patients treated more recently had better survival outcomes. The 5-year breast cancer-specific survival increased from 94.0% in P1 to 96.6% in P2 (p<0.001), and the 5-year disease-free survival increased from 87.9% in P1 to 91.2% in P2 (p<0.001). When analyzed by type of recurrence, distant metastasis-free survival increased to a significant degree. In subgroup analysis by the subtypes of breast cancer, the survival rates improved in all of the subtypes except triple negative breast cancer, and the improvement was more prominent in subtypes with overexpressed human epidermal growth factor receptor 2.This study showed improvement in breast cancer survival over the succeeding years, which is consistent with the advancement in systemic therapy."
https://openalex.org/W4220690494,"One of the most prescribed treatments for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is 5α-reductase inhibitors (5ARI). Europe experienced recent safety issues involving 5ARI and depression symptoms, with similar findings being seen in Western countries. The South Korea has updated the drug label in accordance with European recommendations, but the relevant evidence was insufficient. This study compared the use of 5ARI versus α-blocker (AB) as a treatment for BPH and related risks of depression to provide evidence based on the Korean population.This was a retrospective cohort study using South Korea's Health Insurance Review & Assessment Service claim data from 2011 to 2017. New patients diagnosed in men with BPH and taking medications that contained either 5ARI or AB between July 1, 2013, and June 30, 2015, were included (n = 1,461 5ARI; n = 18,650 AB). The primary outcome was depression defined per the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10: F32-34, F38, F412, F432). Logistic regression was used to implement 1:1 propensity score (PS) matching of patients taking 5ARI to those taking AB to adjust for confounding. Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare the risk of depression associated with 5ARI versus AB.Balance in baseline characteristics between the treatment groups were achieved within PS matched pairs (1,461 pairs). Compared to the AB medication group, the 5ARI group had lower depression (HR: 0.69, 95% CI: [0.51-0.92]). However, we could not find a clinically relevant, statistical difference after PS matching (HR: 0.91, 95% CI: [0.61-1.36]).The risk of depression associated with 5ARI was not meaningfully different from AB in Korea, which suggests that medical officials should provide the most appropriate medication for BPH patients by considering both treatment benefits and depression risk."

In most Southeast Asian countries, the current GHG emissions are estimated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier 1 approach using default emission factors. Sun-drying is the dominant manure treatment in Vietnam, and in this study, we measured GHG emissions during manure drying using a chamber-based approach. Results show the emission factors for CH4 and N2O were 0.295 ± 0.078 g kg-1 volatile solids (VS) and 0.132 ± 0.136 g N2O-N kg-1 Ninitial, respectively. We monitored the total bacterial/archaeal community using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and measured the abundance of functional genes required for methanogenesis (mcrA), nitrification (amoA) and denitrification (nirK, nirS and nosZ) processes. Methane emission occurred only at the beginning of the drying process (days 1 to 3). The results of amplicon sequencing indicated that the relative abundance of methanogens also decreased during this period. Although some nitrification activity was detected, there was no significant N2O emission. These findings well describe the manure management system in south Vietnam and the GHG emission from this manure category, paving the way for higher Tier estimations using country-specific values."
https://openalex.org/W4220975599,"Preterm birth is associated with increased risk of complications, specifically with regards to the gastrointestinal tract. These complications mainly include the maldigestion and malabsorption of nutrients resulting from the immaturity of the small intestine. The current study investigated whether pre-digestion of fat in infant formula would affect the developmental remodeling of the structure of the small intestine mucous membrane. Three groups of premature piglets (corresponding to 30-32 week of human gestation) were used in the study: the first group, not subjected to any treatment and euthanized within 2 hours after caesarian delivery, was used as the control group (PT group), the second group, was fed an infant formula-IF (SPT group), and the third group was fed a lipase pre-hydrolyzed infant formula-hIF (PPT group). Feeding preterm piglets with an infant formula for 14 days stimulated intestinal maturation (in SPT and PPT groups). However, pre-digestion of the infant formula with lipase significantly increased proliferative activity and intensity of apoptosis in the small intestine epithelium, resulting in more rapid enterocyte turnover. The data obtained not only confirm that starting enteral feeding directly after birth stimulates developmental and structural changes in the small intestine, but also highlighted the importance of lipid digestion for enterocyte turnover and speeding up of intestinal maturation in preterm piglets. The latest is of high importance for the proper gut development of preterm children."
https://openalex.org/W4220978896,"After feeding on a tree leaf, caterpillars in ten families sever the petiole and allow the remaining leaf fragment to fall to the ground. Previous researchers proposed that the caterpillars thereby reduced bird predation by eliminating visual evidence of feeding. In this study, 26 species of caterpillars in five families were filmed clipping leaves. Caterpillar behavior did not conform to the visual cue hypothesis. Some caterpillars clipped midribs and petioles repeatedly even though a single clip would suffice to reduce visual cues for birds. Every caterpillar that clipped a leaf rubbed its spinneret (which secretes saliva from the labial glands) over the petiole or midrib stub. In the notodontids Symmerista albifrons and S. leucitys, petiole stubs were bathed in red fluid. Cauterizing the spinneret eliminated fluid application. Dissections documented that the anterior portion of their labial glands contained red pigment, thereby confirming that the red secretion is saliva. When applied to petiole stubs, the red pigment in Symmerista saliva travelled several mm in five minutes within the petiole xylem demonstrating the potential for rapid movement of salivary constituents into the plant. In diverse caterpillars, including species that clip leaves, saliva contains substances reported to suppress plant defenses. Thus, leaf clipping likely functions primarily not to remove visual cues, but to introduce salivary constituents into the plant that prevent defenses from being mobilized in nearby leaves where the caterpillar feeds next."
https://openalex.org/W4220995442,"Group B Streptococcus (GBS) causes infections in women during pregnancy and puerperium and invasive infections in newborns. The genes lmb, cylE, scpB, and hvgA are involved with increased virulence of GBS, and hypervirulent clones have been identified in different regions. In addition, increasing resistance of GBS to macrolides and lincosamides has been reported, so knowing the patterns of antibiotic resistance may be necessary to prevent and treat GBS infections. This study aimed to identify virulence genes and antibiotic resistance associated with GBS colonization in pregnant women from northeastern Mexico.Pregnant women with 35-37 weeks of gestation underwent recto-vaginal swabbing. One swab was inoculated into Todd-Hewitt broth supplemented with gentamicin and nalidixic acid, a second swab was inoculated into LIM enrichment broth, and a third swab was submerged into a transport medium. All samples were subcultured onto blood agar. After overnight incubation, suggestive colonies with or without hemolysis were analyzed to confirm GBS identification by Gram staining, catalase test, hippurate hydrolysis, CAMP test, and incubation in a chromogenic medium. We used latex agglutination to confirm and serotype GBS isolates. Antibiotic resistance patterns were assessed by Vitek 2 and disk diffusion. Periumbilical, rectal and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from some newborns of colonized mothers. All colonized women and their newborns were followed up for three months to assess the development of disease attributable to GBS. Draft genomes of all GBS isolates were obtained by whole-genome sequencing. In addition, bioinformatic analysis to identify genes encoding capsular polysaccharides and virulence factors was performed using BRIG, while antibiotic resistance genes were identified using the CARD database.We found 17 GBS colonized women out of 1154 pregnant women (1.47%). None of the six newborns sampled were colonized, and no complications due to GBS were detected in pregnant women or newborns. Three isolates were serotype I, 5 serotype II, 3 serotype III, 4 serotype IV, and 2 serotype V. Ten distinct virulence gene profiles were identified, being scpB, lmb, fbsA, acp, PI-1, PI-2a, cylE the most common (3/14, 21%). The virulence genes identified were scpB, lmb, cylE, PI-1, fbsA, PI-2a, acp, fbsB, PI-2b, and hvgA. We identified resistance to tetracycline in 65% (11/17) of the isolates, intermediate susceptibility to clindamycin in 41% (7/17), and reduced susceptibility to ampicillin in 23.5% (4/17). The tetM gene associated to tetracyclines resistance was found in 79% (11/14) and the mel and mefA genes associated to macrolides resistance in 7% (1/14).The low prevalence of colonization and the non-occurrence of mother-to-child transmission suggest that the intentional search for GBS colonization in this population is not justified. Our results also suggest that risk factors should guide the use of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. The detection of strains with genes coding virulence factors means that clones with pathogenic potential circulates in this region. On the other hand, the identification of decreased susceptibility to antibiotics from different antimicrobial categories shows the importance of adequately knowing the resistance patterns to prevent and to treat GBS perinatal infection."

We examine samples from the Sankauyama I site on Tanegashima Island, southern Japan, dating to the Incipient Jomon, ca. 14,000/13,500-12,800 cal BP, with a well-defined geochronology. Our NAA results corroborate with the petrographic study suggesting that pottery was mainly produced in-situ, but some vessels were transported long distances from another island. Changing from high mobility, sedentary Incipient Jomon foragers made pottery, occasionally investing in long-distance ceramic vessel transportation and exchange likely involving ocean crossing. This may be associated with a risk-buffering strategy in the context of rising sea levels and isolation of Tanegashima."
https://openalex.org/W4220747950,"Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is reported as an aggressive cancer which leads to high mortality and no effective therapeutic target has yet been discovered. Surgical resection is the main method to treat patients with CCA. However, only one-third of CCA patients have the opportunity to accept the operation, leading to poor prognosis for CCA patients. Therefore, it is necessary to search for new therapeutic targets of CCA or core genes involved in the happening and growth of CCA.In this study, we utilized bioinformatics technology and accessed to several medical databases trying to find the core genes of CCA for the purpose of intervening CCA through figuring out an effective curative target.Firstly, three differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were discovered from GEPIA, and by further observing the distribution and gene expression, CHST4 was obtained as the core gene. Afterwards, correlated genes of CHST4 in CCA were identified using UALCAN to construct a gene expression profile. We obtained PPI network by Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Networks Genes (STRING) and screened core genes using cytoscape software. Functional enrichment analyses were carried out and the expression of CHST in human tissues and tumors was observed. Finally, a CCA model was established for qPCR and staining validation.Three differentially expressed genes (DEGs), CHST4, MBOAT4 and RP11-525K10.3, were obtained. All were more over-expressed in CCA samples than the normal, among which the change multiple and the gene expression difference of CHST4 was the most obvious. Therefore, CHST4 was selected as the core gene. We can see in our established protein-protein interaction (PPI) network that CHST4 had the highest degree of connectivity, demonstrating its close association with CCA. We found that genes were mainly enriched in CCs in the PPI networks genes which shows functional enrichment analysis results, including golgi lumen, extracellular space and extracellular region. CHST4 was found very specifically expressed in the bile duct and was significantly different from that in normal tissues. The overexpression of CHST4 was further verified in the established animal model of TAA-induced CCA in rats. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) demonstrated that CHST4 was significantly overexpressed in tumor tissues, verifying the role of CHST4 as the core gene of CCA.CHST4 was increasingly expressed in CCA and CHST4 is worth being studied much further in the intervention of CCA."

Specifically, 64 licensed drivers were recruited to comparative study the effects of different driving styles on the decision to pass through yellow lights under both daytime and nighttime lighting conditions using a driving simulator and a VR device. The results showed that maladjusted drivers more likely to pass the yellow light faster than adapted drivers (81.25% vs 43.75%) during both day and night. Male drivers had higher overall driving style scores than female drivers, and male drivers were faster and more likely to pass a yellow light than female drivers (56.25% vs 31.25%). This study also found that inexperienced drivers were faster and more likely to pass a yellow light than experienced drivers (50% vs 37.5%). Overall, maladjusted drivers are more likely to pass yellow lights, which can be improved and society properties by enhancing driving learning for maladjusted drivers."

Two distinct forms of TGM1-like mRNA were molecularly cloned from the cells of white sturgeon and detected in green sturgeon cells, accounting for their cellular envelope forming ability. The protein translated from each displayed a cluster of cysteine residues resembling the membrane anchorage region expressed in epidermal cells of teleosts and tetrapods. One of the two mRNA forms (called A) was present at considerably higher levels than the other (called B) in both species. Continuous lines of white sturgeon epidermal cells were established and characterized. Size measurements indicated that a substantial fraction of the cells became enlarged, appearing similar to squames in human epidermal keratinocyte cultures. The cultures also expressed CYP1A, a cytochrome P450 enzyme inducible by activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor 2 in fish. The cells gradually improved in growth rate over a dozen passages while retaining envelope forming ability, TGM1 expression and CYP1A inducibility. These cell lines are thus potential models for studying evolution of fish epidermis leading to terrestrial adaptation and for testing sturgeon sensitivity to environmental stresses such as pollution."
https://openalex.org/W4220833117,"Several studies reveal a problematic prevalence of research misbehaviors. There are several potential causes of research misconduct but ensuring that scientists hold attitudes that reflect norms of acceptable behaviors is fundamental.Our aim was to evaluate the psychometric properties (factor structure and reliability) of an ""attitude"" scale that we adopted from a questionnaire we previously used to investigate the prevalence of research misbehaviors in the Middle East.We used data from participants (n = 254) who were involved in our prior questionnaire study to determine the validity of an attitude scale that we adapted from this previous study. We performed exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to determine the factor structure of the attitude scale followed by measures of convergent and concurrent validity. We assessed reliability by computing the Cronbach's alphas of each construct of the attitude scale.EFA indicated that the attitude scale consists of two factors (constructs). Convergent validity was demonstrated by significant correlations of item-item and item-total. Correlation analysis revealed that the attitude constructs were significantly correlated with the Research Misbehavior Severity Score, thereby demonstrating concurrent validity. Cronbach's alphas were greater than 0.75 for both constructs.We demonstrated a valid and reliable 20-item attitude scale with two factors related to ""acceptability of practices in responsible conduct in research"" and ""general attitudes regarding scientific misconduct"". The use of a validated attitude scale can help assess the effectiveness of educational programs that focus on participants acquiring attitudes that are instrumental in responsible conduct in research."
https://openalex.org/W4220843794,"Asparagus wild relatives could be a promising possibility to extent the genetic variability of garden asparagus and for new cultivars with favorable traits such as high yield stability, disease resistance and stress tolerance. In order to achieve an efficient use in breeding, a detailed cytogenetic characterization of the accessions is necessary. This study worked on 35 Asparagus accessions, including A. officinalis cultivars ('Darlise', 'Ravel' and 'Steiners Violetta') and Asparagus wild relatives, for which the number of chromosomes, their size, the nuclear DNA content, and the genomic distribution of 5S and 45S rDNA were analyzed. Different ploidy levels (diploid, triploid, tetraploid, pentaploid and hexaploid) were found. Furthermore, the size of the chromosomes of all diploid Asparagus accessions was determined which led to differences in the karyotypic formula. A. plocamoides harbors the smallest chromosome with 1.21 μm, whereas the largest chromosome with 5.43 μm was found in A. officinalis. In all accessions one 5S rDNA locus per genome was observed, while the number of 45S rDNA loci varied between one (A. albus, A. plumosus, A. stipularis) to four (A. setaceus). In most Asparagus accessions, the 5S and 45S rDNA signals were located on different chromosomes. In contrast, the genomes of A. africanus, A. plocamoides, A. sp. (a taxonomically unclassified Asparagus species from Asia) and A. verticillatus (diploid accessions) have one 5S and one 45S rDNA signal on the same chromosome. The measured 2C DNA content ranges from 1.43 pg (A. plocamoides, diploid) to 8.24 pg (A. amarus, hexaploid). Intraspecific variations for chromosome number, karyotypic formula, signal pattern with 5S and 45s rDNA probes and DNA content were observed. Interspecific variations were also recognized in the genus Asparagus."
https://openalex.org/W4220929552,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after liver transplantation, mostly in patients transplanted for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, obesity and diabetes. Few data exist on cardiovascular diseases among patients transplanted for viral hepatitis.Our aim is to clarify the cardiovascular risk and subclinical vascular damage among liver transplant recipients for chronic viral hepatitis (i.e. hepatits C virus, hepatis B virus and hepatitis D virus infection).Adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) with orthotopic liver transplants (OLT) due to viral hepatitis who signed informed consent, and were admitted for a routine follow-up between June 2019 and September 2020 at the Infectious Disease outpatient clinic of the University of Campania Luigi Vanvitelli, Naples, Italy, were prospectively enrolled. An estimation of cardiovascular risk was assessed using three main risk charts, echocolor-Doppler of epiaortic vessels was performed to assess subclinical Intima-Media changes.A total of 161 patients were evaluated; of these 15 were excluded because not affected by viral hepatitis. 146 patients were considered. 83 patients (56.8%) were considered at high cardiovascular risk according to Framingham, 54 patients (36.9%) to American Heart Association Arteriosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) score and 19 (13.0%) to Heart Score. Only 8 patients (5.4%) showed a normal carotid ultrasound, while 52 patients (35.6%) had a carotid artery Intima-Media Thickness (IMT) and 86 (58.9%) an atherosclerotic plaque.Liver transplant recipients for virus-related associated liver disease are, in light of the high percentage of carotid lesions, at high risk of CVD. Risk charts compared to subclinical carotid lesions which represent damage already established and a real localization of the disease, seem to underestimate the cardiovascular risk. A chronic inflammatory status, could play a key role. It's important to raise the awareness of cardiovascular risk in liver transplant patients to prevent cardiovascular diseases and improve the timing of early diagnosis of premature vascular lesions."
https://openalex.org/W4220989743,"Measurements of human attitudes and perceptions have traditionally used numerical point judgments. In the present study, we compared conventional point estimates of weight with an interval judgment method. Participants were allowed to make step by step judgments, successively converging towards their best estimate. Participants estimated, in grams, the weight of differently sized boxes, estimates thus susceptible to the size-weight illusion. The illusion makes the smaller of two objects of the same weight, differing only in size, to be perceived as heavier. The self-selected interval method entails participants judging a highest and lowest reasonable value for the true weight. This is followed by a splitting procedure, consecutive choices of selecting the upper or lower half of the interval the individual estimates most likely to include the true value. Compared to point estimates, interval midpoints showed less variability and reduced the size-weight illusion, but only to a limited extent. Accuracy improvements from the interval method were limited, but the between participant variation suggests that the method has merit."
https://openalex.org/W4221005343,"Assessing the solid wood content is crucial when acquiring stacked roundwood. A frequently used method for this is to multiply determined conversion factors by the measured gross volume. However, the conversion factors are influenced by several log and stack parameters. Although these parameters have been identified and studied, their individual influence has not yet been analyzed using a broad statistical basis. This is due to the considerable financial resources that the data collection entails. To overcome this shortcoming, a 3D-simulation model was developed. It generates virtual wood stacks of randomized composition based on one individual data set of logs, which may be real or defined by the user. In this study, the development and evaluation of the simulation model are presented. The model was evaluated by conducting a sensitivity and a quantitative analysis of the simulation outcomes based on real measurements of 405 logs of Norway spruce and 20 stacks constituted with these. The results of the simulation outcomes revealed a small overestimation of the net volume of real stacks: by 1.2% for net volume over bark and by 3.2% for net volume under bark. Furthermore, according to the calculated mean bias error (MBE), the model underestimates the gross volume by 0.02%. In addition, the results of the sensitivity analysis confirmed the capability of the model to adequately consider variations in the input parameters and to provide reliable outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4221007317,"Through the integration of results from an imaging analysis of intracellular trafficking of labelled neurosecretory vesicles in chromaffin cells, we develop a Markov state model to describe their transport and binding kinetics. Our simulation results indicate that a spatial redistribution of neurosecretory vesicles occurs upon secretagogue stimulation leading vesicles to the plasma membrane where they undergo fusion thereby releasing adrenaline and noradrenaline. Furthermore, we find that this redistribution alone can explain the observed up-regulation of vesicle transport upon stimulation and its directional bias towards the plasma membrane. Parameter fitting indicates that in the deeper compartment within the cell, vesicle transport is asymmetric and characterised by a bias towards the plasma membrane."
https://openalex.org/W4221022319,"Aims To determine the psychosocial impact of assistive technology(AT) based on robotics and artificial intelligence in the life of people with disabilities. Background The best match between any person with disabilities and its AT only can be gotten through a complete assessment and monitoring of his/her needs, abilities, priorities, difficulties and limitations. Without this analysis, it’s possible that the device won’t meet the individual’s expectations. Therefore, it is important that any project focused on the development of innovating AT for people with disabilities includes the perspective of outcome measures as an important phase of the research. In this sense, the integration of the assessment, implementation process and outcome measures is crucial to guarantee the transferability for the project findings and to get the perspective from the final user. Methods Pilot study, with prospective, longitudinal and analytical cohort. The study lasts from July 2020 until April 2023. The sample is formed by people with disabilities, ages from 2–21, that will participate from the first stage of the process (initial assessment of their abilities and needs) to the final application of outcome measures instruments (with a complete implication during the test of technology). Discussion Only with the active participation of the person is possible to carry out a user-centered approach. This fact will allow us to define and generate technological solutions that really adjust to the expectations, needs and priorities of the people with disabilities, avoiding the AT from being abandoned, with the consequent health and social spending.

https://openalex.org/W4226064455,"It is widely assumed that in our lifetimes the products available in the global economy have become more diverse. This assumption is difficult to investigate directly, however, because it is difficult to collect the necessary data about every product in an economy each year. We solve this problem by mining publicly available textual descriptions of the products of every large US firms each year from 1997 to 2017. Although many aspects of economic productivity have been steadily rising during this period, our text-based measurements show that the diversity of the products of at least large US firms has steadily declined. This downward trend is visible using a variety of product diversity metrics, including some that depend on a measurement of the similarity of the products of every single pair of firms. The current state of the art in comprehensive and detailed firm-similarity measurements is a Boolean word vector model due to Hoberg and Phillips. We measure diversity using firm-similarities from this Boolean model and two more sophisticated variants, and we consistently observe a significant dropping trend in product diversity. These results make it possible to frame and start to test specific hypotheses for explaining the dropping product diversity trend."
