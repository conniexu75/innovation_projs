https://openalex.org/W1497181681,"A calcium-activated factor (CaAF) has been isolated and partially purified from the post-myofibrillar supernatant fraction of rabbit skeletal muscle. The 200-fold purified CaAF hydrolyzed denatured casein, [3-H]acetyl hemoglobin, and N-ethyl[3-H]maleimide-labeled alpha-actinin. The proteolytic activity has a pH optimum at 6.9 and is dependent on the presence of Ca2+ (optimum concentration, 10 mM). Digestion of isolated myofibrils with CaAF results in removal of Z-lines and in a parallel loss of a 90, 000-dalton protein that has a mobility identical with that of alpha-actinin as determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A protein with the properties of alpha-actinin (identical electrophoretic mobility, and ability to accelerate the Mg2+-activated ATPase of reconstituted actomyosin) was isolated from the supernatant of CaAF-treated myofibrils. The release of alpha-actinin from myofibrils by the calcium-activated neutral protease occurs in the absence of detectable change in the electrophoretic profiles of the other myofibrillar proteins, or in the ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N, N' tetraacetic acid (EGTA) sensitivity of Mg2+-activated ATPase. In contrast to the specific removal of Z-lines and of alpha-actinin by CaAF, trypsin treatment of myofibrils results in extensive degradation of myosin heavy chains and of the inhibitory component of troponin (TN-I), and in loss of EGTA sensitivity of myofibrillar ATPase. The degradation of TN-I and loss of EGTA sensitivity occur before the Z-line disappearance."
https://openalex.org/W2039520294,"Cot analysis shows that the haploid Drosophila genome contains 12% rapidly reassociating, highly reiterated DNA, 12% middle repetitive DNA with an average reiteration frequency of 70, and 70% single-copy DNA. The distribution of the middle repetitive sequences in the genome has been studied by an examination in the electron microscope of the structures obtained when middle repetitive sequences present on large DNA strands reassociate and by the hydroxyapatite binding methods developed by Davidson et al. (1973). At least one third by weight of the middle repetitive sequences are interspersed in single-copy sequences. These interspersed middle repetitive sequences have a fairly uniform distribution of lengths from less than 0.5 to 13 kb, with a number average value of 5.6 kb. The average distance between middle repetitive sequences is greater than 13 kb. The data do not exclude the possibility that essentially all of the middle repetitive sequences have the interspersion pattern described above; however, it is possible that some of the middle repetitive sequences of Drosophila are clustered in stretches of length much greater than 13 kb. The interspersion pattern of the middle repetitive sequences in Drosophila is quite different from that which occurs in the sea urchin, in Xenopus, in rat, and probably many other higher eucaryotes."

https://openalex.org/W2133818400,"pDm plasmids were constructed from D. melanogaster and pSC101 DNAs by a modification of the EcoR1-ligase method which insured that each hybrid molecule contained a single segment of D. melanogaster chromosomal DNA (Dm segment). The sequences in the Dm segments of six cloned pDm DNAs were mapped within the D. melanogaster polytene chromosomes by in situ hybridization, and their repetition frequencies within the Dm segment and within the genome were determined. Four of these segments consist of sequences that are confined to single chromomeric regions in the polytene chromosomes and exhibit little or no repetition. The characteristics of this group, and also two of three Dm segments analyzed earlier ( Wensink et al., 1974 Wensink P.C. Finnegan D.J. Donelson J.E. Hogness D.S. Cell. 1974; 3: 315-325 Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar ), are inconsistent with tandem repetition models of the chromomere. By contrast, the other two Dm segments contain moderately repetitive sequences that are located in the heterochromatin. One of these appears to be a segment of the Y chromosome in which about half the sequences are nonrepetitive and half are repeated about 33 times per genome, though they are not repeated within the segment. The second contains the DNA coding for 18 and 28S rRNA."

https://openalex.org/W1989410640,"The properties of inverted repeat (foldback) sequences in Drosophila melanogaster DNA have been studied by HAP chromatography and electron microscope methods. Electron microscope observations show that there is a broad distribution of lengths of the duplex regions of the inverted repeats from very short to greater than 15 kb, with number and weight average values of 1.35 kb and 5.0 kb respectively. About 20% of the inverted repeats are separated by a single-strand spacer with lengths too short to observe, but the other 80% have spacers, P, with lengths ranging from 0.5 kb to greater than 30 kb. The number average and weight average spacer lengths for the total sample are 2.7 kb and 6.1 kb. With respect to the lengths of the spacers, P, between inverted repeats, the Drosophila genome differs from that of most organisms which have been studied where the spacers P are mostly too short to be measured. EM and HAP studies suggest that the average center-to-center spacing between sets of inverted repeats is 40-80 kb. The HAP studies show that there is a broad range of thermal stabilities for the duplexes formed by reassociation of inverted repeat sequences. Kinetic analysis shows that all of the frequency components of the Drosophila genome are present in the inverted repeats, the loops P, and the flanking sequences. There is a somewhat larger proportion of middle repetitive DNA in those inverted repeat duplexes which are resistant to digestion by Mung Bean Endonuclease I. These enzyme resistant duplexes comprise about 3% of the entire genome. It is estimated that there are approximately 2000-4000 inverted repeat pairs in the entire genome."

https://openalex.org/W2064646224,"The messenger RNA lifetimes have been measured in a cell line derived from an invertebrate source, the mosquito Aedes albopictus. The experiments were made possible by a new technique for obtaining undegraded cytoplasmic RNA from cells with high endogenous nuclease levels. There are two components to the decay kinetics of Aedes mRNA. The major fraction of the steady state message population has a half-life of 20 hr which is, as in mammalian cells, comparable to the cell generation time. The short-lived component turns over very rapidly with a half-life estimated to be about 1.2 hr. The difference in lifetime between the short and long-lived components is about 15 fold in these cells, compared to 3-4 fold in mammalian cells. This may reflect the need for a more responsive mRNA regulating system in poikilothermic organisms. The great disparity between the principle messenger lifetimes permits a more definite assignment of a two component behavior to message decay. The data in the case of mammalian cells could not rule out a family of intermediate lifetimes. The long-lived mRNA has a much smaller average sedimentation value than the short-lived material. The effect is similar to, but much larger than, that seen in mammalian cells. Although the lifetime difference is much greater in the insect cells than in human (HeLa) cells, the fast and slow components comprise about the same proportion of the steady state mRNA population: 30 percent and 70 percent, respectively."

https://openalex.org/W2164937210,"The Qbeta host factor, a heat-stable protein necessary in concert with Qbeta replicase for phage Qbeta RNA replication in vitro, has been localized in Escherichia coli and found to be associated primarily with ribosomes. This location has been established both by complement fixation assays with highly specific antiserum directed against the host factor, and by in vitro stimulation of Qbeta RNA replication by the Qbeta replicase. The complement fixation assay has provided the estimate that there are approximately 2500 copies of the host factor polypeptide per cell. The host factor is released from the ribosomes by a 1 M NH4Cl wash and concentrated by ammonium sulfate precipitation. It can be purified to apparent homogeneity in one further step by chromatography on poly(A)-cellulose. Ribosomal protein S1 subunit I of Qbeta replicase) also binds to the poly(A)-cellulose column and elutes before the host factor. In agreement with previous reports, we find that the host factor has a monomer molecular weight of 12,000 as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels, and a native molecular weight of 72,000 as judged by the stoichiometric interaction of the host factor with Qbeta RNA, by sedimentation in sucrose velocity gradients, and by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel mobility when incompletely disaggregated. The Qbeta host factor is a potent inhibitor of an in vitro poly(A)-directed polylysine protein-synthesizing system, but has less effect on the in vitro translation of poly(U), R17 RNA, late T7 mRNA, or endogenous E. coli mRNA. The amino acid composition and NH2- terminal sequence rule out the host factor as one of the known 30 S or 50 S E. coli ribosomal proteins. The finding that the Qbeta host factor is associated with ribosomes in vivo completes the demonstration that all of the host-supplied proteins required for phage Qbeta RNA replication in vitro are either associated with ribosomes or are involved in the protein-synthetic machinery of the cell."
https://openalex.org/W1599210974,"Mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase has been purified to homogeneity from avian liver. The enzyme in dilute phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, has an S20,w of 5.7 S and a molecular weight of 105,000 determined by sedimentation equilibrium; the presence of 0.1 M KCl causes dissociation to a form one-half that size, i.e. about 57,000 daltons. Since the subunit molecular weight of the synthase determined by the dodecyl sulfate acrylamide gel method is 53,000, it appears that the native enzyme is a dimer composed of weight-homogeneous subunits. A number of molecular and catalytic properties allow the mitochondrial and cytoplasmic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthases to be distinguished. The pI of the homogeneous mitochondrial enzyme is 7.2. This value, while identical to that of the single isoelectric-focusing species of broken mitochondrial preparations, differs from those of the multiple 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthases found in the cytoplasmic fraction which exhibit pI values of 4.8 and 6.7. Rabbit antibodies against the purified mitochondrial synthase are capable of precipitating the mitochondrial, but not the cytoplasmic, synthase(s) of avian liver. Finally, the synthase differ kinetically in their responses to divalent magnesium ion, the mitochondrial enzyme being inhibited and the cytoplasmic enzyme(s) activated. It is proposed that the mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase of liver functions in ketogenesis while its cytoplasmic counterpart participates in cholesterogenesis (Clinken-Beard, K. D., Sugiyama, T., Reed, W. D. and Lane, M.D. (1975) J. Biol. Chem. 250, 3124-3134)."
https://openalex.org/W1586768377,"A purification procedure for RNA polymerase from uninfected and phage SP01-infected Bacillus subtilis is presented. The RNA polymerase purified from B. subtilis 10 min after infection with wild type phage SP01 is resolved into two major fractions (B, C) and one minor fraction (A) by calf thymus DNA-cellulose chromatography. Fraction C is indistinguishable from RNA polymerase from uninfected cells with respect to transcription specificity (both before and after phosphocellulose chromatography). Fraction B yields, on subsequent phosphocellulose chromatography, an enzyme (B-P) whose properties distinguish it from the host RNA polymerase. Enzyme B-P preferentially transcribes SP01 DNA and selectively forms rapidly initiating complexes with SP01 DNA but not with heterologous DNA. The SP01 RNA synthesized by Enzyme B-P includes, as previously reported, a large proportion of asymmetrical middle viral RNA. Host RNA polymerase holoenzyme synthesizes asymmetrical early viral RNA, while host core polymerase synthesizes symmetrical RNA that is complementary to early, middle, and late in vivo viral RNA and contains a preponderance of antimessenger. The subunit composition of Enzyme B-P is identical to host core polymerase with respect to the beta,beta', and alpha subunits and two additional components of mr equals 9,500 and 11,000 that we observe in all preparations of RNA polymerase. In addition, Enzyme B-P has two subunits of mr equals 13,000 and 28,000, which are synthesized after phage infection. On heterologous template, Enzyme B-P and host core polymerase have comparable activities. On these templates, addition of host initiation factor, sigma, restores full activity to Enzyme B-P as well as to host core polymerase. Sigma also modifies the activity of Enzyme B-P on SP01 DNA, restoring some asymmetrical early RNA transcription while retaining some asymmetrical middle RNA transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1533908152,"The 30 S ribosomal proteins near the binding site for initiation factor IF-2 in Escherichia coli were identified by allowing complexes of 30 S subunits, [32P]phosphoryl initiation factor IF-2 and nonradioactive initiation factors IF-1 and IF-3, to react with the protein cross-linking reagent dimethylsuberimidate. Noncross-linked initiation factors were removed by centrifugation of the complexes in buffer containing a high salt concentration; the protein was extracted from the pelleted particles; and cross-linked species containing initiation factor IF-2 and ribosomal proteins were partially purified by column chromatography on Sephadex G-75. The mixture of cross-linked products was analyzed by radioimmunodiffusion with antisera prepared against 20 individual 30 S ribosomal proteins S1, S2, S11, S12, S13, S14, and S19 was interpreted to mean that initiation factor IF-2 was present in covalent cross-linked complexes containing those proteins. The results imply that these 30 S ribosomal proteins are near the binding site for initiation factor IF-2."
https://openalex.org/W2045212385,In less developed countries protein-calorie malnutrition of early childhood is widespread. Severe syndromes such as kwashiorkor and marasmus are found in 1-7% of young children in some populations. Many more are affected by less severe manifestations. It has been estimated that there are 10-20 million young children with severe syndromes most of whom will die without treatment. Conversely infantile obesity is becoming a problem in more affluent populations. Recently the pattern of malnutrition has altered in many developing countries due to urbanization and a decline in breast-feeding. Nutritional marasmus with diarrhea in the 1st year of life is more common. Human milk as compared with cows milk contains a more abundant supply of nutriments most needed for the rapid growth and development of the central nervous system. Much illness in early childhood is related to infection which occurs more easily in those with malnutrition and aggravates that condition. Breast-feeding is known to have a contraceptive effect. Appropriate child spacing is thus aided. Human milk must be considered a resource priority in national development policy and in international planning for health. As an emergency measure in famine relief attention should be given to providing food for lactating women rather than to distributing formulas.

The identity of two major crosslinked products was determined by iodinating the product and analyzing the tryptic peptides.

https://openalex.org/W2007767349,"Cultured MPC 11 mouse myeloma cells synthesize not only gamma2b heavy and kappa light chains but also a carboxyl terminal (constant region) fragment of kappa light chain. In vitro translational analysis of total cytoplasmic and microsomal RNA indicates that these cells contain RNA which directs synthesis of both a light chain precursor and a light chain fragment precursor. Variant clones which do not synthesize either heavy or light chains continue to synthesize the light chain fragment. One such ""nonproducing"" variant was studied in detail. It does not contain translatable mRNA for the intact light chain but does contain RNA which is translated into the light chain fragment precursor. Nucleic acid hybridization analysis with a cDNA probe specific for the constant region of kappa light chains revealed that microsomal RNA from the wild-type cell contains both 14S and a 10S species of kappa specific RNA, whereas the variant contains only the 10S species. Translational analysis of these same RNAs indicates that the 14S species codes for the light chain precursor, while the 10S RNA codes for the light chain fragment precursor."

https://openalex.org/W1608595226,In fasting-refeeding experiments glucagon was found to inhibit the induction of rat liver glucose-6-P dehydrogenase. The kinetics of induction in the presence of glucagon indicated that the hormone decreased the rate of enzyme synthesis without altering the rate of enzyme degradation. Immunochemical titration of the amount of glucose-6-P dehydrogenase protein present in control and glucagon treated rats suggests that glucagon does not produce an inhibited species of the enzyme. Isolation of radioactive glucose-6-P dehydrogenase by precipitation with a specific antiserum provided direct evidence that glucagon inhibited the synthesis of the enzyme. Under identical conditions glucagon had no effect on the levels of 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase.
https://openalex.org/W1529585389,"An alpha-fucosyltransferase activity has been detected in a purified membrane preparation isolated from bovine spleen which catalyzes the transfer of L-fucose from GDP-L-[14C]-fucose to a tetraglycosylceramide (Lac-nTet-cer, Galbetal-4GlcNAcbeta1-3Galbeta1-4-Glc-cer) to form the blood group H-related glycosphingolipid. The membrane preparation contained a highly active endogenous nonlipid acceptor, which could be precipitated by 5% trichloroacetic acid or chloroform-methanol-water (6:3:5, v/v/v), whereas there was little endogenous glycosphingolipid acceptor. The optimum pH value for the incorporation of L-fucose was 6.4 in cacodylate-HCl buffer. The Km values were 0.6 mM and 0.36 mM for Lac-nTet-cer and GDP-L-fucose, respectively. The 14C-labeled product of the reaction was isolated and purified; it migrated with human erythrocyte blood group H-active pentaglycosylceramide. the terminal [14C]fucose was hydrolyzed 85% and 55% by 0.1 N trichloroacetic acid at 100 degrees for 2 hours and Charonia lampas alpha-fucosidase (19 hours at 37 degrees), respectively.

https://openalex.org/W1600238826,"Two 30 S ribosomal proteins from Escherichia coli have been found to be uniquely required for assembly of 30 S ribosomal subunits. 30 S ribosomes were reconstituted in vitro from 16 S RNA and a mixture of purified 30 S ribosomal proteins (sigma Si). In the absence of S16, sigmaSi-S16 particles were slowly assembled wich had physical and functional properties similar to complete particles (sigmaSi). The results indicate that S16 affects the rate of 30 S ribosome assembly, but does not appear to be directly involved in any known ribosomal function. Particles assembled in the absence of S18 (sigmaSi-S18) had high activity in poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis but lost considerable activity upon isolation or purification. The loss of activity could be attributed primarily to the loss of proteins S11 and S21. S18 appears to have a major role in the stabilization of ribosome structure, especially the binding of proteins S11 and S21, and does not appear to be directly required for activity in poly(U)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis. However, it is possible that S18 has some functional role which is not required for polyphenylalanine synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1964776856,"Long pyrimidine tracts, purified from Drosophila melanogaster DNA after treatment with formic acid-diphenylamine, were used as template for E. coli RNA polymerase to produce a polynucleotide containing only purines. This polypurine RNA hybridized specifically to D. melanogaster DNA with high efficiency at low Cot values. The resulting hybrid showed high thermal stability. When polypurine RNA was subjected to complete hydrolysis with ribonuclease T1, over 90% of the nucleotide products were ApGp and ApApGp. Partial hydrolysis yielded a distinct additional component, ApApGpApGp + ApGpApApGp. We conclude that the major sequence in the polypurine transcript is (ApGpApApGp)n. In situ hybridization to salivary gland polytene chromosomes and to metaphase chromosomes from neural ganglia indicated that polypyrimidines complementary to polypurine RNA are located in heterochromatin. In femal cells, the predominant labeling was on centromeric heterochromatin of the 2nd chromosome. We have verified the location of polypyrimidines in neural ganglion cells, by using a cytological marker of chromosomes 2. In male cells, hybrid was also found on the Y chromosome."

Chem. 248, 6329-6034). An analysis of the amino acid composition reveals very little differences in the two proteins. Each protein has alanine as the NH2-terminal residue. The aminopeptidases were treated separately with acetic anhydride; as noted in the past, the presence of glycerol is required to achieve excellent yields of acetylated active derivatives (Siegel, S., and Awad, W.M., Jr. (1973 J. Biol. Chem. 248, 3233-3240). However, in the present case much higher concentrations of glycerol (50%) are needed during acetylation to obtain derivatives with completely reacted NH2-terminal residues. The epsilon-amino groups were not completely acetylated. In contrast to the native enzymes, the acetylated derivatives show an affinity for DEAE-cellulose, a property consonant with the changes in net charge. The kinetic constants for each enzyme against L-leucine-p-nitroanilide do not change significantly after acetylation. The specificities of the two aminopeptidases were examined extensively on a semiquantitative basis. The activities are not restricted by the length of substrate chains. Each enzyme shows a preference for hydrophobic residues at the ultimate and penultimate positions. Charge residues are released a slower rates. No prolidase activity is demonstrable even at high enzyme to substrate ratios; however, NH2-terminal proline residues are released readily. D-Amino acid residues at the ultimate or penultimate position substantially reduce the rate of hydrolysis; D-leucyl-D-leucine is not hydrolyzed..."

https://openalex.org/W2125320987,"Very long runs of pyrimidine nucleotides (polypyrimidines), previously detected in DNA from Drosophila melanogaster, have now been localized to a “cryptic” satellite. These polypyrimidines have an average length of 750 nucleotides and account for about 3% of the thymine residues in total DNA. The buoyant density of the DNA component which contains the polypyrimidines was detected by centrifuging native DNA to equilibrium in a CsCI gradient, and then assaying each fraction for its content of polypyrimidines. A peak was detected at a density of about 1.707 gm/cm3, distinctly heavier than the main band of DNA (1.702 gm/cm3). The buoyant density of polypyrimidine-containing molecules was little affected by differences in the molecular weight of the starting DNA in the range 105-107 daltons (single-stranded). Thus polypyrimidines (and their complementary polypurines) appear to form all or part of a “cryptic” satellite. Polypyrimidines have been isolated and characterized with respect to composition and buoyant density. Direct nucleoside analysis of unlabeled material indicated 34.5% deoxycytidine, 65.5% thymidine. Their banding position in neutral and alkaline CsCI gradients was consistent with a single-stranded DNA polymer of this composition."
https://openalex.org/W2080860267,"THE mammalian malaria host–parasite systems seem particularly useful for studies aimed at elucidating the biochemical mechanisms of such interactions. During the vertebrate phase of their life cycles the malaria organisms are intracellular parasites of the red cell. The mature mammalian host red cell is also relatively simple metabolically; its energy metabolism is solely that of Embden–Meyerhof glycolysis and it also lacks the capacity for protein synthesis. We therefore studied several aspects of red cell glycolysis in monkeys heavily infected with Plasmodium knowlesi and mice heavily infected with P. berghei. In both these systems we have found an increase in red blood cell adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and a decrease in red cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG). We also have evidence that these malaria parasites introduce a pyruvate kinase isozyme into their host red cells in amounts sufficient to alter red cell glycolysis. First, glycolytic intermediate data demonstrate an in vivo increase in pyruvate kinase activity in infected red cells; second, there is an increase in pyruvate kinase Vmax activity in infected cells; and third, gel electrophoretic patterns show a new pyruvate kinase isozyme in infected cells. We suggest that this alteration in red cell glycolysis is in a direction favourable to the parasite because it will increase red cell ATP at the expense of red cell DPG."

https://openalex.org/W1526018881,"Highly purified glycogen synthase D, free of synthase kinase and phosphatase activities, was prepared from bovine heart. The enzyme had no activity without glucose 6-phosphate. Kinetic studies of this enzyme at various concentrations of UDP-glucose demonstrated that there was no cooperativity with respect to the substrate at any concentration of glucose-6-P with or without Mg2+. Glucose 6-phosphate increased the maximum velocity (Vmax) of the enzyme, but had very little or no effect on the Michaelis constant for UDP-glucose (Km equals 0.33 mM). Free Mg2+ gave a high Vmax at all glucose 6-phosphate concentrations without affecting the Km for the substrate. The double reciprocal plots of reaction rates versus glucose 6-phosphate concentration were biphasic and were interpreted as evidence for two kinetic forms, each with a glucose 6-phosphate binding site of different affinity (A1/2 values equals 0.31 and 1.1 mM). High Mg2+ concentrations nearly abolished the biphasic kinetic behavior of glucose 6-phosphate, suggesting that the Vmax of both enzyme forms was the same at saturating concentration of Mg2+ and glucose 6-phosphate and that magnesium ion might have no effect on the binding of glucose 6-phosphate or on the state of the equilibrium between two forms. Plots of reaction velocity versus Mg2+ concentration showed no cooperativity of Mg2+ activation in the presence or absence of glucose 6-phosphate. Both kinetic forms of glycogen synthase D had the same affinity for Mg2+ (A1/2 is approximately equal to 4 mM). Studies on the inhibition of the enzyme by Pi, ATP, and UTP were carried out with assays specific for the form of synthase with A1/2 for glucose 6-phosphate equals 0.31 mM (high affinity form) and the form with A1/2 for glucose 6-phosphate equals 1.1 mM (LOW AFFINITY FORM) BY ASSAYING WITH AND WITHOUT 5.0 MM free Mg2+, respectively. Both forms of synthase exhibited positive cooperativity with respect to UDP-glucose when inhibited by UTP, but not with Pi or ATP. Thus, each form of the enzyme had more than one UDP-glucose site, and these sites showed cooperativity only in the presence of a uridine nucleotide inhibitor. In the absence of Mg2+ (low affinity form), the inhibitors, Pi, ATP, and UTP, all induced positive cooperativity with respect to glucose 6-phosphate binding to this enzyme. The positive cooperativity induced by ATP was obliterated by adding free Mg2+ (high affinity form), but that induced by other inhibitors was affected slightly or not at all by the cation. These results indicate that each of the enzyme forms (high or low affinity forms) has more than one glucose 6-phosphate site and that these may function in a cooperative manner. The preceding findings are interpreted in relation to the importance of Mg2+ in the regulation of glycogen synthase D activity as well as the regulation of glycogen synthase phosphatase activity in heart."

These data suggest the isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase of E. coli contains some metal ion, which is necessary for the enzyme to catalyze the reaction."

The solubilized proteins have molecular weights in the range of 40,000 to 70,000 and can be added back to B. megaterium toluene-treated cells to reconstitute the synthetic reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1897196805,"Using the I form of rabbit muscle glycogen synthase essentially free of glycogen, the kinetics and mechanism of action was investigated. No evidence for an exchange between [14C]UDP and UDP-glucose was found. The bisubstrate kinetics of the enzyme for UDP-glucose and glycogen, as well as for UDP-glucose and maltose, was determined. An intersecting pattern in the double reciprocal plot (velocity versus substrate concentration) suggestive of a sequential mechanism (ordered or random) was found in all cases. The K-m for UDP-glucose (45 to 48 mM) was the same with either maltose or glycogen as acceptor. The K-m for maltose (230 mM) and for glycogen (1.5 mug/ml) differed."

https://openalex.org/W63021547,"With respect to its sulfhydryl groups, subunit X can exist in at least two forms, oxidized (Xox) and reduced (Xre). The importance of the Xre form for the formation of an EX complex and for amidotransferase activity has been examined. Subunit Xre is rapidly inactivated by p-chloromercuribenzoate and bromopyruvate, whereas subunit Xox, which is not catalytically functional in amidotransferase activity, is not affected. The glutamine analogue 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) has no effect on Xre alone but rapidly inactivates the EXre complex. DON-inactivated subunit X cannot be reactivated by 2-mercaptoethanol but can be readily displaced from subunit E by free subunit Xre. The integrity of the EXre complex is maintained following gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 in the presence of glutamine and 2-mercaptoethanol, thus the binding of glutamine to the complex does not require the binding of other substrates. Subunit Xox, however, does not aggregate with subunit E since no EXox complex is found following gel filtration on Sephadex G-100 in the presence of glutamine and in the absence of 2-mercaptoethanol. Thus, a reduced sulfhydryl group(s) is not only essential for amidotransferase activity but also for the formation of the aggregate as well. The following model is proposed to explain these results. Free subunit Xre does not bind DON or glutamine to the catalytically functional sulfhydryl group. Upon aggregation with subunit E, however, the glutamine or DON binds to the glutamine catalytic site on subunit Xre and amidotransfer or alkylation occurs. An EX complex which has been alkylated by DON can be readily dissociated and it is suggested that following catalysis the EX complex may also dissociate."
https://openalex.org/W1581969575,"These studies are directed toward determining whether the structural genes for protein biosynthetic factors comprise an operon subject to coordinate regulation in Escherichia coli. To assess coordinate expression of these genes, an immunoassay was devided to enable accurate quantitation of initiation and elongation factors in crude bacterial extracts. The antibodies made against highly purified initiation factor 2 (IF-2A and IF-2B) and elongation factor G (EF-G) are shown to inhibit the appropriate in vitro reactions and precipitate proteins co-migrating with appropriate factors on polyacrylamide gels. Immunoprecipitation in combination with gel electrophoresis was employed to make quantitative measurements of the amounts of IF-2 (A and B) relative to EF-G present in cells at different growth rates. The results show that the ratio of EF-G to IF-2 varies in a consistent way with the generation time of the cell. IF-2 levels remain constant as cells double more rapidly, WHEREAS THE EF-G content increases with more rapid cell growth."

https://openalex.org/W2136403642,"Cultures of Tetrahymena pyriformis were incubated for 1 hour with a mixture of acetate, pyruvate, and pentanoate with only one substrate labeled at a time and with the position of the label chosen so that [1-14-C]acetyl coenzyme A was an early product of the metabolism of each substrate. The appearance of label in CO2, lipids, glycogen, glutamate, and alanine were measured and results interpreted in terms of a previously developed three-compartment model of metabolism, which was found to quantitatively describe the data even when two of the flux rates (the flux of acetyl-CoA from the peroxisomal to the outer mitochondrial compartment and from the outer mitrochondrial to the inner mitochondrial compartment) were set equal to zero. This reduction in the number of independent parameters leads to the model being overdetermined and to a probably unique fit of the three-compartment model tof the present data and to previous data when octanoate was the fatty acid substrate. Pentanoate was metabolized to a greater extent than octanoate and did not inhibit growth. Pentanoate inhibited acetate utilization in both the inner mitochondrial and peroxisomal compartments as indicated by a reduction in the incorporation of label from [1-14-C]acetate into lipids and into CO2, but there was no difference in oxidation of [2-14-C]pyruvate when pentanoate was the fatty acid substrate as compared to octanoate. Glyconeogenesis was inhibited when pentanoate was substituted for octanoate. Similar experiments were performed on cells treated with 4-pentenoic acid. The effects of 4-pentenoic acid were essentially the same whether octanoate or pentanoate was the fatty acid substrate, i.e. inhibition of glyconeogenesis from all labeled substrates and inhibition of [2-14-C]pyruvate oxidation. The results indicate that the effects of pentanoate are largely confined to the peroxisomal and the inner mitochondrial compartments whereas the effects of 4-pentenoic acid are confined to the peroxisomal and outer mitochondrial compartments."
