https://openalex.org/W2037850111,"Samples of foraminiferal ooze were exposed to ocean water at various depths for 4 months, attached to the taut wire of a buoy in the central Pacific. Appreciable solution took place below 1000 meters and increased rapidly below 3000 meters and below 5000 meters. The fact that samples from different locations appear to dissolve at different rates suggests that the previous history of a sample determines its solubility. Solution is selective; it changes species composition, size distribution, content of damaged shells, and average particle weight of an assemblage."

The distribution is concentrated toward the galactic plane, and most of the sources are believed to lie within 2 kiloparsecs of the sun. It is estimated that the average luminosity of the observed sources is about 5 x 10(36) ergs per second and that the entire galaxy contains about 1250 such sources. Comparisons of fluxes observed over the course of the past 2 years reveal that many sources are highly variable."
https://openalex.org/W2004930807,Chemical treatments involving ion exchange cause gross onedimensional swelling in water of single crystals of vermiculite minerals. A delicate balance of forces holds the individual silicate layers (10 angstroms thick) parallel to one another although separated by several hundred angstroms. Colloidal dispersions produced from the swollen crystals are morphologically unique and show strong filmforming characteristics.
https://openalex.org/W2047980907,"The 40Ar/39Ar ages of a sanidine clast from a melt-matrix breccia of the Manson, Iowa, impact structure (MIS) indicate that the MIS formed 73.8 ± 0.3 million years ago (Ma) and is not coincident with the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary (64.43 ± 0.05 Ma). The MIS sanidine is 9 million years older than 40Ar/39Ar age spectra of MIS shock-metamorphosed microcline and melt-matrix breccia interpreted earlier to be 64 to 65 Ma. Grains of shock-metamorphosed quartz, feldspar, and zircon were found in the Crow Creek Member (upper Campanian) at a biostratigraphic level constrained by radiometric ages in the Pierre Shale of South Dakota that are consistent with the 40Ar/39Ar age of 73.8 ± 0.3 Ma for MIS reported herein."

https://openalex.org/W2072318357,"A 14-meter core from a crater lake on Saint Paul Island in the Pribilofs has been examined by pollen analysis. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the core spans more than 10,000 years and probably more than 18,000 years. A sprutce-pollen maximum about 10,000 years ago suggests that spruce advanced to the flanks of the southern coast of the Bering land bridge toward the close of the land-bridge period. The forests of Alaska and Siberia did not merge, however, and the environment of the southern coast of the land bridge remained cold."
https://openalex.org/W2073976657,"Fossils of Periastron reticulatum Unger emended. Beck recovered from the Erin Slate of the Talladega slate belt of Alabama establish that these rocks have a Mississippian (Kinderhookian-Tournaisian) age. The Talladega slate belt, the southwestern extension of the western Blue Ridge belt, was interpreted to have been affected by regional dynamothermal metamorphism and coeval deformation as a result of the Acadian orogeny. This fossil find indicates that metamorphism and deformation of the Talladega belt occurred after the Early Carboniferous (Alleghanian), requiring a reevaluation of tectonic interpretations of the southernmost Appalachians."

If no crustal warping of the Late Cenozoic age has occurred in this part of Florida (as investigators generally agree), the sea must have approached its present level 4 to 7 million years ago."
https://openalex.org/W2078746421,"This technical comment includes two major comments on an article by David J. Thompson on bias in the climate record, and a reply by the author. The first critique describes the results of using daily insead of yearly data to look at variations in climate, finding that concerns about the manner in chich clmatologists have calculated trends based on monthly and annual time series to be of little consequence during the instrumental climate record. The second critique addresses specifically misidentification of the anomalistic year signature in temperature time series; decrease in amplitude of seasonal temperature variation; variability in the phase curves from different locations; and Post-1930 epoch: phase and carbon dioxide correspondence. 19 refs., 3 figs."

https://openalex.org/W2041140364,"Europe, traditionally the breeding ground for basic scientific research until the 1930's, is only now approaching full recovery from the devastating effects of the war. Great Britain has a more stimulating climate for research, a more progressive graduate-school program, and a more flexible professorship structure than any other country of Europe. Germany still has several years to go before the effects of the war will be obliterated. In most northern European countries, the organization and support of academic research ranges from good to excellent, and a stimulating intellectual atmosphere exists. Germany is rapidly contending for the lead in basic research along with England and Sweden, which are now in the forefront. The Netherlands is typified by superb organization, and most of the Scandinavian countries are high in quality if not always in quantity of research. France is characterized by brilliant individual contributions but over-all falls far short of her potential for scientific research. Switzerland, a highly industrialized country, is geared primarily for engineering and does not compete as highly on basic research as might otherwise be expected. Italian research is good in certain areas but is plagued by a number of difficulties that retard progress. Nevertheless, there are encouraging efforts being made in Italy to develop some good scientific programs. In the south of Europe the situation is generally discouraging and will continue to be so, except where a few dedicated, brilliant individuals are making good contributions with the meager resources available.

Europe will continue to be a tremendous scientific manpower reserve for the United States, and, despite accusations of proselyting, the fact remains that in many European countries the employment possibilities are not commensurate with the production rate of scientists and engineers. If the universities of Europe would realign the professional structure of their departmental staffs and extend their graduate curricula they would give far more opportunity to young research scientists and make better use of their facilities. America can indeed be grateful to Europe for a great cultural and academic heritage, and one can sincerely hope that close cooperation in science will take place for many years to come."
