https://openalex.org/W2089115552,"A high-temperature plasma is created when an intense laser pulse is focused onto the surface of a solid. An ultrafast pulse of x-ray radiation is emitted from such a plasma when the laser pulse length is less than a picosecond. A high-speed streak camera detector was used to determine the duration of these x-ray pulses, and computer simulations of the plasmas agree with the experimental results. Scaling laws predict that brighter and more efficient x-ray sources will be obtained by the use of more intense laser pulses. These sources can be used for time-resolved x-ray scattering studies and for the development of x-ray lasers."

Fossil Pinus sylvestris stumps in far northern Scotland demonstrate former presence of pine trees where conventional pollen evidence of pine forests is lacking. Radiocarbon, dendrochronological, and fine temporal-resolution palynological data show that pine forests were present for about four centuries some 4000 years ago; the forests expanded and then retreated rapidly some 70 to 80 kilometers. Despite the rapidity of this response to climate change, it occurred at rates slower by an order of magnitude than those necessary to maintain equilibrium with forecast climate changes attributed to the greenhouse effect."

Tides raised on the earth by the moon have caused an expansion of the lunar orbit. Tides raised on the moon by the earth have de-spun the moon to synchronous rotation and driven its spin axis to a Cassini state—that is, in a coprecessing configuration, coplanar with the lunar orbit normal and the normal to the Laplacian plane (which is at present coincident with the normal to the ecliptic). This combination of events has resulted in a complex history for the lunar spin axis. For much of the period during which its orbital semimajor axis expanded between 30 and 40 earth radii, the obliquity of the moon was of order 25° to 50°. In fact, for a brief period the obliquity periodically attained a value as high as 77°; that is, the spin axis of the moon was only 13° from lying in its orbit plane."
https://openalex.org/W2040515582,"As today's public and governments become more environmentally conscious we are increasingly concerned about the environmental component of product and service options available in our affluent society. Our choices are often made instinctively, from necessity, since a detailed analysis of the relative environmental merits of using canned versus fresh versus frozen foods, or glass versus paper versus steel versus aluminum packaging would simply be too time consuming for each purchase. If, however, the environmental merit question is restricted to a small enough purchase sector it is possible to conduct a complete analysis of relative merit from the initial resource through the manufacturing stages, use attributes, and recycle options through to final use or disposal of the item. Many environmentally appropriate choices of products can only be made after such an analysis. An outline of one such analysis, that of paper versus polystyrene foam as the material of construction for hot drink containers in fast food or other single use applications, is given here."
https://openalex.org/W2076611442,"Tochilinite, an ordered mixed-layer mineral containing Mg, Al, Fe, Ni, S, and O, has been identified in an interplanetary dust particle (IDP). This mineral is found in only one other class of meteoritic materials, type CM carbonaceous chondrites. The presence of tochilinite in an IDP provides a direct petrogenetic link between a member of the layer-silicate subset of IDPs and a specific class of meteorites and thus establishes that some IDPs collected in the stratosphere have an asteroidal origin. The scarcity of this IDP type suggests that materials with CM mineralogy are not abundant among the dust-producing asteroids."

It is assigned to the genus Catagonus Ameghino, heretofore considered confined to the Pleistocene. The new peccary is conspecific with Catagonus wagneri (Rusconi), a species placed in the related extinct genus Platygonus LeConte when it was described from pre-Hispanic archeological deposits of Argentina."

https://openalex.org/W2066785399,"Halo dark matter, if it is baryonic, may plausibly consist of compact stellar remnants. Jeans mass clouds containing 10(6) to 10(8) solar masses could have efficiently formed stars in the early universe and could plausibly have generated, for a suitably top-heavy stellar initial mass function, a high abundance of neutron stars as well as a small admixture of long-lived low mass stars. Within the resulting clusters of dark remnants, which eventually are tidally disrupted when halos eventually form, captures of neutron stars by non-degenerate stars resulted in formation of close binaries. These evolve to produce, by the present epoch, an observable x-ray signal associated with dark matter aggregations in galaxy halos and galaxy cluster cores."
