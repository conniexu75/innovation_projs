https://openalex.org/W3214090787,"Estimating net primary productivity (NPP) is significant in global climate change research and carbon cycle. However, there are many uncertainties in different NPP modeling results and the process of NPP is challenging to model on the absence of data. In this study, we used meteorological data as input to simulate vegetation NPP through climate-based model, synthetic model and CASA model. Then, the results from three models were compared with MODIS NPP and observed data over China from 2000 to 2015. The statistics evaluation metrics (Relative Bias (RB), Pearson linear Correlation Coefficient (CC), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE)) between simulated NPP and MODIS NPP were calculated. The results implied that the CASA-model performed better than the other two models in terms of RB, RMSE, NSE and CC whether on the national or the regional scale. It has a higher CC with 0.51 and a smaller RMSE with 111.96 g C·m -2 ·yr -1 in the whole country. The synthetic model and CASA-model has the same advantages at some regions, and there are lower RMSE in Southern China (86.35 g C·m -2 ·yr -1 ), Xinjiang (85.53 g C·m -2 ·yr -1 ) and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (93.22 g C·m -2 ·yr -1 ). The climate-based model has widespread overestimation and large systematic errors, along with worse performances (NSEmax = 0.45) and other metric indexes unsatisfactory, especially Qinghai-Tibet Plateau with relatively lower accuracy because of the unavailable observation data. Overall, the CASA-model is much more ideal for estimating NPP all over China in the absence of data. This study provides a comprehensive intercomparison of different NPP-simulated models and can provide powerful help for researchers to select the appropriate NPP evaluation model."
https://openalex.org/W3212270627,"Recombinant production of viral proteins can be used to produce vaccine antigens or reagents to identify antibodies in patient serum. Minimally, these proteins must be correctly folded and have appropriate post-translation modifications. Here we report the production of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) in the green algae Chlamydomonas. RBD fused to a fluorescent reporter protein accumulates as an intact protein when targeted for ER-Golgi retention or secreted from the cell, while a chloroplast localized version is truncated. The ER-retained RBD fusion protein was able to bind the human ACE2 receptor, the host target of SARS-CoV-2, and was specifically out-competed by mammalian cell-produced recombinant RBD, suggesting that the algae produced proteins are sufficiently post-translationally modified to act as authentic SARS-CoV-2 antigens. Because algae can be grown at large scale very inexpensively, this recombinant protein may be a low cost alternative to other expression platforms."
https://openalex.org/W3214295032,"In an era of anthropocene, threatened and endemic species with small population sizes and habitat specialists experience a greater global conservation concern in view of being at higher risk of extinction. Predicting and plotting appropriate potential habitats for such species is a rational method for monitoring and restoring their dwindling populations in expected territories. Ecological niche modelling (ENM) coalesces species existence sites with environmental raster layers to construct models that describe possible distributions of plant species. The present study is aimed to study the potential distribution and cultivation hotspots for reintroducing the high value, vulnerable medicinal herb (Rheum webbianum) in the Union territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh using population attributes and ecological niche modelling approach. Sixty-three populations inventoried from twenty-eight areas display a significant change in the phytosociological attributes on account of various anthropogenic threats. The current potential habitats coincide with actual distribution records and the mean value of Area Under Curve (AUC) was 0.98 and the line of predicted omission was almost adjacent to omission in training samples, thus validating a robustness of the model. The potential habitat suitability map based on the current climatic conditions predicted a total of 103760 km2 as suitable area for the growth of Rheum webbianum. Under the future climatic conditions, there is a significant reduction in the habitat suitability ranging from -78531.34 Km2 (RCP 4.5 for 2050) to -77325.81 (RCP 8.5 for 2070). Furthermore, there is a slight increase in the suitable habitats under future climatic conditions, ranging from +21.99 Km2 under RCP 8.5 (2050) to +3.14 Km2 under RCP 4.5 (2070). The Jackknife tests indicated Precipitation of Driest Month (BIO14) as the most contributing climatic variable in governing the distribution of R. webbianum. Therefore, scientifically sound management strategies are urgently needed to save whatever populations are left in-situ to protect this species from getting extinct. Present results can be used by conservationists for mitigating the biodiversity decline and exploring undocumented populations of R. webbianum on one hand and by policymakers in implementing the policy of conservation of species with specific habitat requirements by launching species recovery programmes in future on the other."
https://openalex.org/W3211445443,"Background Recent studies have indicated that disrespectful/abusive/coercive service by skilled care providers in health facilities that results in actual or perceived poor quality of care is directly and indirectly associated with adverse maternal and newborn outcomes. According to the 2016 Ethiopian Demography and Health Survey, only 26% of births were attended by qualified clinicians, with a maternal mortality rate of 412 per 100,000 live-births. Using seven categories developed by Bowser and Hill (2010), this study looked at disrespect and abuse experienced by women in labor and delivery rooms in health facilities of Borena Ddistrict, South Wollo, Ethiopia. Methods A facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 374 immediate postpartum women in Borena District from January 12 to March 12, 2020. Systematic sampling was used to access respondents to participate in a structured, pre-tested face-to-face exit interview. Data were entered into EpiData version 4.6 and exported to SPSS version 25 for analysis. Finally, bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis were performed to declare statistically significant factors related to maternal disrespect and abusive care in Borena District at a p-value of &lt; 0.05 and at 95% CI. Result Almost four out of five (79.4%) women experienced at least one type of disrespect and abuse during facility-based childbirth. The most frequently reported type of disrespect and abuse was non-consented care 63.7%. Wealth index [AOR = 3.27; 95% CI: (1.47, 7.25)], type of health facility [AOR = 1.96; 95% CI: (1.01, 3.78)], presence of companion(s) [AOR = 0.05; 95% CI: (0.02, 0.12)], and presence of complications [AOR = 2.65; 95% CI: (1.17, 5.99)] were factors found to be significantly related to women experiencing disrespect and abuse. Conclusion The results showed that wealth index, type of health facility, presence of companion(s), and birth complications were found to be significant factors. Therefore, health personnel need to develop interventions that integrate provider’s behavior on companionship and prevention of complications across facilities to reduce the impact of disrespectful and abusive care for laboring women."
https://openalex.org/W3213461115,"According to IPCC Annual Report (AR-5), environmental impact assessment of any product prototype is recommended before its large-scale commercialization; however, no environmental profile analysis of any biodiesel prototype has been conducted in Pakistan. Therefore, objective of this study was to conduct a comprehensive life cycle assessment (LCA), water footprint and cumulative energy demand (CED) of biodiesel production from Jatropha curcas L. (JC) seeds oil in Pakistan. A cradle-to-gate LCA approach was applied for 400 liter (L) JC biodiesel produced in Pakistan. JC biodiesel production chain was divided into three stages i.e., 1). cultivation of JC crop 2). crude oil extraction from JC seeds and 3). crude oil conversion to biodiesel. Primary data for all the stages were acquired through questionnaire surveys, field visits and measurements in the field. Potential environmental impacts were calculated in SimaPro v.9.2 software using Eco-indicator 99 methodology. Results showed that crude oil extraction stage accounted for highest emissions (77%) to the overall environmental impact categories evaluated, followed by oil conversion stage (21%) and JC cultivation stage (02%), respectively. The three stages of JC biodiesel production chain are major contributor to ecotoxicity with a contribution of 57% to this impact category. Higher contribution to ecotoxicity was due to agrochemicals used in the JC cultivation. Similarly, fossil fuels impact category was responsible for 38% of overall environmental impacts. In addition, water footprint of JC biodiesel production chain was 2632.54 m3/reference unit. Cumulative energy required for 400L JC biodiesel production chain was 46745.70 MJ in Pakistan. Fossil diesel consumption, synthetic fertilizers use and purchased electricity were major hotspot sources to environmental burdens caused by JC biodiesel production in Pakistan. By performing sensitivity analysis at 20% reduction of the baseline values of fossil diesel used, synthetic fertilizers and purchased electricity, a marked decrease in environmental footprint was observed. It is highly recommended that use of renewable energy instead of fossil energy would provide environmental benefits such as lower greenhouse gases and other toxic emissions as compared to conventional petroleum fuels. It is also recommended that JC as a biofuel plant, has been reported to have many desired characteristics such as quick growth, easy cultivation, drought resistance, pest and insect resistance, and mainly great oil content in JC seeds (27-40%). Therefore, JC plant is highly recommended to Billion Tree Afforestation Project (BTAP) for plantation on wasteland because it has multipurpose benefits."
https://openalex.org/W3212239868,"Background HIV Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is the regular use of antiretroviral medication by people who are not infected with HIV to prevent seroconversion. Israel approved PrEP for continuous use in 2017, and Israeli Health Maintenance Organizations (HMO) offered PrEP with a copayment to eligible members. Methodology This retrospective cohort study included all people who were dispensed PrEP between September 2017 to June 2019 in the second largest HMO in Israel. Statistical analysis, including Kaplan Meier, was conducted to evaluate user PrEP purchase, adherence to medical follow-up, and clinical outcomes. Results In total, a cohort of 757 PrEP users were followed for 657.8 person-years. All but one user were male; median age was 35 years. At baseline, 0.8% had gonorrhea and 1.5% had chlamydia infections and 4.4% had recent syphilis infection. Continuous use of PrEP (without interruption/discontinuation) was observed in 29.9%, while 39.9% interrupted and 30.3% discontinued use. Median time to first interruption/discontinuation was 4.0 months. At 6–12 months after initiation, 79.8% of users had a documented HIV test, 77.3% a Chlamydia-Gonorrhea panel, and 78.9% a creatinine test. There was one new case of HIV among the cohort, five months after PrEP discontinuation. Estimated first-year infection rates were 5.0%, 8.6% and 6.8% for gonorrhea, chlamydia and first-time syphilis, respectively. Conclusions This study shows heterogeneous PrEP purchase patterns and required medical follow-up, and an increase in STIs among consistent PrEP users. Improving adherence to recommended medical follow-up during PrEP use is essential in PrEP’s integration into Israel’s national HIV prevention strategy."
https://openalex.org/W3212519414,"Background Uncorrected refractive error (URE) is a major cause of vision impairment in children worldwide. Cases are often detected through a school-based vision screening program and then treated in a follow-up appointment. This requires parents or guardians (‘parents’) to adhere to referrals for the eye exam and care plan. We aim to understand the reasons for parents’ referral non-adherence in Cross River State, Nigeria, using qualitative methods. Methods Ten focus groups were held with parents who had not adhered to the referral for a follow-up eye examination. Participants were recruited with help from staff in schools hosting the vision screening programme. Interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide, audio taped and transcribed verbatim. After identifying relevant quotes, the researchers labelled each one with a descriptive code/subcode label. Then they clustered the data into categories and overarching themes. Results Forty-four parents participated in 10 focus group discussions with 28 women and 16 men. Three themes and participated in the focus group discussions with 28 women (63%). Twelve themes were generated. The three megathemes were Modifiable Factors (with 4 themes), Contextual Factors (with 6 themes), and Recommendations (with 2 themes). Conclusion Participants identified modifiable barriers that make it difficult for parents to adhere to a referral for a follow-up eye exam. These include not believing their child has a vision problem or the screening test, and issues with the referral letter. They also described important contextual factors such as poverty, logistical problems, parental attitudes towards their children and beliefs about appropriate care. Many of these issues could be addressed by following their recommendation to educate the public on the importance of child eye care and correct parents’ misconceptions. These themes will be used by the Nigerian government to enhance and scale up its child eye health programme."
https://openalex.org/W3214134283,"The development of globalization has separated the production and consumption of products spatially, and the international trade of products has become a carrier of embodied carbon trade. This paper adopted the perspective of value-added trade to calculate the amount of embodied carbon trade of China from 2006 to 2015 and perform a structural decomposition analysis of the changes in China's embodied carbon trade. This study found that: (1) China's embodied carbon exports are much larger than its embodied carbon imports, and there are differences between countries. China imported the largest amount of embodied carbon from South Korea, and it exported the largest amount of embodied carbon to the United States. (2) The structural decomposition analysis shows that changes in the value-added carbon emission coefficient during the study period would have caused China's embodied carbon trade to decrease, and changes in value-added trade would have caused China's embodied carbon trade to increase. Therefore, countries trading with China need to strengthen their cooperation with China in energy conservation, emission reduction, and product trade. In order to accurately reflect China's embodied carbon trade, it is necessary to calculate embodied carbon trade from the perspective of value-added trade."
https://openalex.org/W3211796849,"This study investigates the differential expression and the mechanism of long intergenic non-protein coding RNA (LINC) 01857 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) proliferation and apoptosis.LINC01857 expression in HCC tissues and cells was evaluated. In addition, gain-of and loss-of functions were carried out to assess HCC cell proliferation and apoptosis. After that, LINC01857 subcellular localization was predicted and verified. Additionally, the binding relations between LINC01857 and microRNA (miRNA)-197-3p and between miR-197-3p and anterior GRadient 2 (AGR2) were detected and confirmed. Besides, HCC cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed after silencing LINC01857 or overexpressing AGR2. Next, levels of key factors in the AKT and ERK pathways were measured. Additionally, xenograft transplantation was also conducted to confirm the effect of LINC01857 in HCC.LINC01857 was overexpressed in HCC. Silencing LINC01857 leads to a blockage in HCC cell proliferation but improved apoptosis. LINC01857 could competitively bind to miR-197-3p and thus upregulate AGR2. miR-197-3p was poorly expressed in HCC, while AGR2 was overexpressed. Mechanistically, downregulated miR-197-3p or overexpressed AGR2 were observed to attenuate the effect of the LINC01857 knockdown on suppressing cell proliferation and enhancing apoptosis. Moreover, LINC01857 activated the AKT and ERK pathways through the manipulation of the miR-197-3p/AGR2 axis in HCC.The results of this study indicated that LINC01857 was highly expressed in HCC, and it could improve HCC cell proliferation and reduce apoptosis via competitively binding to miR-197-3p, promoting AGR2 and upregulating the AKT and ERK pathways."
https://openalex.org/W3213411683,"The spatial and temporal characteristics of drought in Northeast China are investigated, using monthly meteorological data from 140 stations over the period 1970-2014. The study area was divided into three regions using hierarchical cluster analysis based on the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data. The standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) was calculated for each station on 3-month and 12-month time scales. The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test and Sen's slope method were applied to determine the trends for annual and seasonal SPEI time series. Periodic features of drought conditions in each sub-region and possible relationship with large-scale climate patterns were respectively identified using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and cross wavelet transform. The results show mitigations in spring and winter droughts and a significant increasing trend in autumn drought. On the annual scale, droughts became more severe and more intense in the western regions but were mitigated in the eastern region. CWT analysis showed that droughts in Northeast China occur predominantly in 14- to 42-month or 15- to 60-month cycles. Annual and seasonal droughts have 2- to 6-year cycles over the three defined regions. Cross wavelet analysis also shows that the statistically significant influence of large-scale climate patterns (the Southern Oscillation, the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, the Arctic Oscillation, and the Polar-Eurasian Pattern) on drought in Northeast China is concentrated in a 16- to 50-month period, possibly causing drought variability in the different regions. The Southern Oscillation, Polar-Eurasia pattern, and Arctic Oscillation are significantly correlated with drought on decadal scales (around 120-month period). The findings of this study will provide valuable reference for regional drought mitigation and drought prediction."
https://openalex.org/W3211417415,"Microorganisms regulate the redox state of different biomolecules to precisely control biological processes. These processes can be modulated by electrochemically coupling intracellular biomolecules to an external electrode, but current approaches afford only limited control and specificity. Here we describe specific electrochemical control of the reduction of intracellular biomolecules in Escherichia coli through introduction of a heterologous electron transfer pathway. E. coli expressing cymAmtrCAB from Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 consumed electrons directly from a cathode when fumarate or nitrate, both intracellular electron acceptors, were present. The fumarate-triggered current consumption occurred only when fumarate reductase was present, indicating all the electrons passed through this enzyme. Moreover, CymAMtrCAB-expressing E. coli used current to stoichiometrically reduce nitrate. Thus, our work introduces a modular genetic tool to reduce a specific intracellular redox molecule with an electrode, opening the possibility of electronically controlling biological processes such as biosynthesis and growth in any microorganism."
https://openalex.org/W3211549492,"Hemorrhagic disease (HD) caused by a group of elephant endotheliotropic herpesviruses (EEHV) is one of the leading causes of death for young elephants in human care. These viruses are widespread and typically persist latently in adult elephants with no negative effects; however, in juvenile Asian and more recently young African elephants, the onset of disease can be rapid and the mortality rate high. Measuring biomarkers associated with the immune response could be beneficial to understanding underlying disease processes, as well as the management of infection and HD. The goal of this study was to measure acute phase proteins and cytokines in serum collected from elephants infected with EEHV (13 Asian and 1 African) and compare concentrations according to presence, severity and outcome of disease. Serum amyloid A (SAA) and haptoglobin (HP) were higher in elephants with EEHV viremia than those without; concentrations increased with increasing viral load, and were higher in fatal cases compared to those that survived. In Asian elephants, SAA was also higher during EEHV1 viremia compared to EEHV5. Cytokine concentrations were typically low, and no statistical differences existed between groups. However, in individuals with detectable levels, longitudinal profiles indicated changes in tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) that may reflect an immune response to EEHV infection. However, the overall low concentrations detected using previously validated assays do not support the presence of a 'cytokine storm' and suggest more work is needed to understand if sub-optimal immune responses could be involved in disease progression. These results highlight the potential benefit of measuring circulating biomarker concentrations, such as APPs and cytokines, to improve our understanding of EEHV viremia and HD, assist with monitoring the progression of disease and determining the impact of interventions."
https://openalex.org/W3211579048,"The lack of standardized language assessment tools in Russian impedes clinical work, evidence-based practice, and research in Russian-speaking clinical populations. To address this gap in assessment of neurogenic language disorders, we developed and standardized a new comprehensive assessment instrument–the Russian Aphasia Test (RAT). The principal novelty of the RAT is that each subtest corresponds to a specific level of linguistic processing (phonological, lexical-semantic, syntactic, and discourse) in different domains: auditory comprehension, repetition, and oral production. In designing the test, we took into consideration various (psycho)linguistic factors known to influence language performance, as well as specific properties of Russian. The current paper describes the development of the RAT and reports its psychometric properties. A tablet-based version of the RAT was administered to 85 patients with different types and severity of aphasia and to 106 age-matched neurologically healthy controls. We established cutoff values for each subtest indicating deficit in a given task and cutoff values for aphasia based on the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis of the composite score. The RAT showed very high sensitivity (&gt; .93) and specificity (&gt; .96), substantiating its validity for determining presence of aphasia. The test’s high construct validity was evidenced by strong correlations between subtests measuring similar linguistic processes. The concurrent validity of the test was also strong as demonstrated by a high correlation with an existing aphasia battery. Overall high internal, inter-rater, and test-retest reliability were obtained. The RAT is the first comprehensive aphasia language battery in Russian with properly established psychometric properties. It is sensitive to a wide range of language deficits in aphasia and can reliably characterize individual profiles of language impairments. Notably, the RAT is the first comprehensive aphasia test in any language to be fully automatized for administration on a tablet, maximizing further standardization of presentation and scoring procedures."

This study aimed to (1) adapt and translate a validated general and sports NK questionnaire into Arabic (2) assess the NK of Jordanian sportspeople, and (3) evaluate the relationship between NK and various sociodemographic factors.The Abridged Nutrition for Sport Knowledge Questionnaire (ANSKQ) was translated into Arabic using forward-backward translation and underwent pilot testing and psychometric validation (internal consistency, test-retest reliability, inter-rater agreement) using a convenience sample of 30 individuals. Following ANSKQ validation, athletes a from 50 sport institutes in Jordan were invited (via email) to complete the Arabic ANSKQ online. Differences in NK based on demographics were analysed using t-test or ANOVA for continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables. The ability of demographic factors to predict NK score-category (poor/good/average/excellent) was assessed using multivariate logistic regression.The Arabic ANSKQ had excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.92), test-retest reliability (Pearson r = 0.926) and inter-rater agreement (Cohen's k statistic = 0.89). A total of 3636 eligible participants completed the Arabic ANSKQ. Participants were mostly athletes (91.4%), female (68.0%), had normal BMI (50.6%), and played high-intensity sports (59.6%). 88.3% of participants had poor NK (<50%). There were statistically significant differences in NK score based on participant role (athlete vs coach), age, gender, BMI, nationality, smoking, years playing sport, sport frequency, sport intensity, and nutrition training. Multivariate modelling showed participant role, BMI, education level, sport frequency and nutrition training were predictors of NK category.In conclusion, Jordanian sportspeople have poor NK and may benefit from increased nutrition training."
https://openalex.org/W3213631575,"Athletes who want to benefit most optimally and efficient from the Talent Development (TD) pathway, should start developing their psychological characteristics at a young age. The Psychological Characteristics Developing Excellence Questionnaire–Version 2 (PCDEQ2) can provide a full assessment of the mental characteristics athletes need. However, the PCDEQ2 has only been validated in adolescent athletes and as a consequence its does not contribute to the understanding of these psychological skills in a younger age group. The main purpose of this study was to take a first step in examining the factor structure and reliability of the Psychological Characteristics of Developing Excellence Questionnaire for Children (PCDEQ-C), a questionnaire based on the PCDEQ– 2. Firstly, the original questionnaire was translated to Dutch, age-adapted and redesigned for implementation in young athletes. Secondly, 774 participants (400 girls) from Flanders, Belgium, between 7 and 13 years (mean age of 10.61 ± 1.58) old filled out the questionnaire. After exploratory factor analysis, a new factor structure for the PCDEQ-C deemed an acceptable fit with 51 items in 5 factors. In the third stage, the reliability showed a good overall and internal consistency, with adequate relations between factors. The first steps in the validation process of the PCDEQ-C, suggest that this questionnaire could be a useful and reliable tool to assess the developmental psychological characteristics of 7-to-13-year-old athletes. The questionnaire is one of the first formative assessment tools to monitor and develop the psychological characteristics needed during the earliest talent development stages of a young athlete."

Recent data suggest that the gut-lung axis regulates systemic metabolic and immune functions, and microbiota might alter exercise tolerance. Here, we aimed to evaluate the associations between gut microbiota and outcomes in lung cancer patients who underwent lung resection surgery. We analysed stool samples, from 15 early-stage lung cancer patients, collected before and after surgical resection using shotgun metagenomic and Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) sequencing. We analysed microbiome and mycobiome associations with post-surgery lung function and cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) to assess the maximum level of work achieved. There was a significant difference, between pre- and post-surgical resection samples, in microbial community functional profiles and several species from Alistipes and Bacteroides genus, associated with the production of SCFAs, increased significantly in abundance. Interestingly, an increase in VO2 coincides with an increase in certain species and the ""GABA shunt"" pathway, suggesting that treatment outcome might improve by enriching butyrate-producing species. Here, we revealed associations between specific gut bacteria, fungi, and their metabolic pathways with the recovery of lung function and exercise capacity."
https://openalex.org/W3211651704,"The paradigm of positive psychology, significant in nature, helps to explain the proactivity and motivation of human agency, such as a secondary school student's state of autonomy, confidence, and personal resolve to strive for optimal learning and/or non-learning experiences. Our recent research development, in tandem with other scholars' inquiries, has focused on one aspect of positive psychology-namely, a person's achievement of 'optimal best', which reflects the maximization of his/her state of functioning (e.g., cognitive functioning). Capitalizing on our previous research, we develop a psychological concept that we term as a 'perceived feeling of energy'. A perceived feeling of energy (e.g., a perceived feeling of liveliness) is proposed to act as a 'motivational engine', or as a central driver, which then could predict and enhance a person's achievement of optimal best. Six hundred and twenty-seven university students (N = 438 women, 189 men) responded to a suite of self-report questionnaires. Structural equation modelling (SEM) techniques were used to test a conceptual model, where we focused on the antecedent (i.e., the direct impact of self-efficacy on a perceived feeling of energy) and consequence of a perceived feeling energy (i.e., the impact of a perceived feeling of energy on personal resolve, and the sustaining of optimal best). Analysis of results showed support for our original hypothesized model-for example: self-efficacy as an antecedent of energy and the central role of the energy as a predictor and potential mediator of future outcomes."

The present research aimed to clarify sociodemographic and economic factors, including extracurricular tutoring time, associated with weekday-to-weekend sleep differences using longitudinal data.Data from the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey (KCYPS) data were analyzed. Weekday-to-weekend sleep differences and extracurricular tutoring, as well as other covariates, were measured using adolescent's self-report questionnaires. Multilevel regression and structural equation modeling (SEM) of repeated measures were used to test the hypothesized relationship between variables.The time spent in weekly extracurricular tutoring was negatively associated with weekday-to-weekend sleep differences. However, increased tutoring time was positively associated with bedtime, and bedtime was in turn positively associated with differences in Korean adolescents' weekday-to-weekend sleep patterns. The SEM analysis result showed a significant indirect effect of tutoring time on sleep differences via bedtime.Limiting weekly extracurricular tutoring time is important to early bedtime and reducing weekday-to-weekend sleep pattern differences. Policymakers should develop alternatives to private tutoring to improve the sleep duration and reduce weekday-to-weekend sleep differences among adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W3213846825,"State governments in the U.S. have been facing difficult decisions involving tradeoffs between economic and health-related outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite evidence of the effectiveness of government-mandated restrictions mitigating the spread of contagion, these orders are stigmatized due to undesirable economic consequences. This tradeoff resulted in state governments employing mandates at widely different ways. We compare the different policies states implemented during periods of restriction (""lockdown"") and reopening with indicators of COVID-19 spread and consumer card spending at each state during the first ""wave"" of the pandemic in the U.S. between March and August 2020. We find that while some states enacted reopening decisions when the incidence rate of COVID-19 was minimal or sustained in its relative decline, other states relaxed socioeconomic restrictions near their highest incidence and prevalence rates experienced so far. Nevertheless, all states experienced similar trends in consumer card spending recovery, which was strongly correlated with reopening policies following the lockdowns and relatively independent from COVID-19 incidence rates at the time. Our findings suggest that consumer card spending patterns can be attributed to government mandates rather than COVID-19 incidence in the states. We estimate the recovery in states that reopened in late April was more than the recovery in states that did not reopen in the same period- 15% for consumer card spending and 18% for spending by high income households. This result highlights the important role of state policies in minimizing health impacts while promoting economic recovery and helps planning effective interventions in subsequent waves and immunization efforts."
https://openalex.org/W3211426257,"Ecological processes are strongly shaped by human landscape modification, and understanding the reciprocal relationship between ecosystems and modified landscapes is critical for informed conservation. Single axis measures of spatial heterogeneity proliferate in the contemporary gradient ecology literature, though they are unlikely to capture the complexity of ecological responses. Here, we develop a standardized approach for defining multi-dimensional gradients of human influence in heterogeneous landscapes and demonstrate this approach to analyze landscape characteristics of ten ecologically distinct US cities. Using occupancy data of a common human-adaptive songbird collected in each of the cities, we then use our dual-axis gradients to evaluate the utility of our approach. Spatial analysis of landscapes surrounding ten US cities revealed two important axes of variation that are intuitively consistent with the characteristics of multi-use landscapes, but are often confounded in single axis gradients. These were, a hard-to-soft gradient, representing transition from developed areas to non-structural soft areas; and brown-to-green, differentiating between two dominant types of soft landscapes: agriculture (brown) and natural areas (green). Analysis of American robin occurrence data demonstrated that occupancy responds to both hard-to-soft (decreasing with development intensity) and brown-to-green gradient (increasing with more natural area). Overall, our results reveal striking consistency in the dominant sources of variation across ten geographically distinct cities and suggests that our approach advances how we relate variation in ecological responses to human influence. Our case study demonstrates this: robins show a remarkably consistent response to a gradient differentiating agricultural and natural areas, but city-specific responses to the more traditional gradient of development intensity, which would be overlooked with a single gradient approach. Managing ecological communities in human dominated landscapes is extremely challenging due to a lack of standardized approaches and a general understanding of how socio-ecological systems function, and our approach offers promising solutions."
https://openalex.org/W3211601958,"Several studies of patients with COVID-19 have evaluated biological markers for predicting outcomes, most of them retrospectively and with a wide scope of clinical severity. We followed a prospective cohort of patients admitted in hospital wards with moderate COVID-19 disease, including those with a history of kidney transplantation, and examined the ability of changes in routine hematologic laboratory parameters to predict and mirror the patients' clinical course regarding the severity of their condition (classified as critical vs. non-critical) and in-hospital mortality or hospital discharge. Among the 68 patients, 20 (29%) were kidney transplanted patients (KT), and they had much higher mortality than non-kidney transplanted patients in this cohort (40% X 8.3%). Lymphocytes, neutrophils and neutrophils/lymphocytes ratio (NLR) at admission and platelets as well as the red blood cells parameters hemoglobin, hematocrit, and RDW by the time of hospital discharge or death clearly differentiated patients progressing to critical disease and those with clinical recovery. Patients with deteriorating clinical courses presented elevated and similar NLRs during the first week of hospitalization. However, they were dramatically different at hospital discharge, with a decrease in the survivors (NLR around 5.5) and sustained elevation in non-survivors (NLR around 21). Platelets also could distinguish survivors from non-survivors among the critical patients. In conclusion, routine hematologic tests are useful to monitor the clinical course of COVID-19 patients admitted with moderate disease. Unexpectedly, changes in hematologic tests, including lymphopenia, were not predictive of complicated outcomes among KT recipients."
https://openalex.org/W3211790862,"The Proton-Coupled Folate Transporter (PCFT) is a transmembrane transport protein that controls the absorption of dietary folates in the small intestine. PCFT also mediates uptake of chemotherapeutically used antifolates into tumor cells. PCFT has been identified within lipid rafts observed in phospholipid bilayers of plasma membranes, a micro environment that is altered in tumor cells. The present study aimed at investigating the impact of different lipids within Lipid-protein nanodiscs (LPNs), discoidal lipid structures stabilized by membrane scaffold proteins, to yield soluble PCFT expression in an E . coli lysate-based cell-free transcription/translation system. In the absence of detergents or lipids, we observed PCFT quantitatively as precipitate in this system. We then explored the ability of LPNs to support solubilized PCFT expression when present during in-vitro translation. LPNs consisted of either dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine (DMPC), palmitoyl-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC), or dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DMPG). While POPC did not lead to soluble PCFT expression, both DMPG and DMPC supported PCFT translation directly into LPNs, the latter in a concentration dependent manner. The results obtained through this study provide insights into the lipid preferences of PCFT. Membrane-embedded or solubilized PCFT will enable further studies with diverse biophysical approaches to enhance the understanding of the structure and molecular mechanism of folate transport through PCFT."

The lumbopelvic movement and motor control pattern of 30 adults (15 with chronic low back pain, 15 healthy controls) were assessed using 3D motion and electromyographic analysis during the repeated forward bending test, in additional to the clinical outcome measures. Regional kinematics and muscle recruitment pattern of the symptomatic group was analysed before and after the 6-week rehabilitation, and compared to healthy controls. Significant improvement in back pain, functional capacity and self-efficacy of the symptomatic group was found after the rehabilitation. Patients with chronic nonspecific low back pain were capable to recover to a comparable level of the healthy controls in terms of their lumbopelvic movement and motor control pattern upon completion of a 6-week rehabilitation program, despite their dysfunction displayed at baseline. Phase specific motor control reorganization in which more profound and positive changes shown during the flexion phase.

https://openalex.org/W3212566986,"In this work, a new family of distributions, which extends the Beta transmuted family, was obtained, called the Modified Beta Transmuted Family of distribution. This derived family has the Beta Family of Distribution and the Transmuted family of distribution as subfamilies. The Modified beta transmuted frechet, modified beta transmuted exponential, modified beta transmuted gompertz and modified beta transmuted lindley were obtained as special cases. The analytical expressions were studied for some statistical properties of the derived family of distribution which includes the moments, moments generating function and order statistics. The estimates of the parameters of the family were obtained using the maximum likelihood estimation method. Using the exponential distribution as a baseline for the family distribution, the resulting distribution (modified beta transmuted exponential distribution) was studied and its properties. The modified beta transmuted exponential distribution was applied to a real life time data to assess its flexibility in which the results shows a better fit when compared to some competitive models."

Although open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) are effective in treating Pilon fractures, there is a controversy over time to surgery due to reported postoperative complications. However, there is no systematic review evaluating the difference of postoperative complications between early and delayed ORIF for treating pilon fractures.Relevant literature written in English will be searched through PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, MEDLINE, and Web of Science. The study aims to compare the effects and complications of early and delayed ORIF for treating fresh pilon fractures in adult patients. The primary outcome will be infection rate, fracture union time, nonunion and malunion rate. And the secondary outcome will be metalwork removal, amputation, and ankle function grade. Two reviewers will independently assess the eligibility of the studies according to the pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. A meta-analysis for the available data will be conducted using Revman 5.3. To measure effect size, odds ratios (ORs) and mean difference will be used for dichotomous and continuous data, respectively. Statistical heterogeneity will be explored. And a random-effects model or a fixed-effects will be used in pooled data on the basis of the existence or absence of heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis will be conducted to identify sources of heterogeneity and sensitivity analysis to test the results' robustness. We will assess the risk of bias by four different quality assessment tools according to the study design. Publication bias will be evaluated by funnel plot.

https://openalex.org/W3213797409,"Clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of chronic electrical stimulation of the carotid baroreflex for the treatment of hypertension (HTN) are ongoing. However, the mechanisms by which this device lowers blood pressure (BP) are unclear, and it is uncertain which patients are most likely to receive clinical benefit. Mathematical modeling provides the ability to analyze complicated interrelated effects across multiple physiological systems. Our current model HumMod is a large physiological simulator that has been used previously to investigate mechanisms responsible for BP lowering during baroreflex activation therapy (BAT). First, we used HumMod to create a virtual population in which model parameters (n = 335) were randomly varied, resulting in unique models (n = 6092) that we define as a virtual population . This population was calibrated using data from hypertensive obese dogs (n = 6) subjected to BAT. The resultant calibrated virtual population (n = 60) was based on tuning model parameters to match the experimental population in 3 key variables: BP, glomerular filtration rate, and plasma renin activity, both before and after BAT. In the calibrated population, responses of these 3 key variables to chronic BAT were statistically similar to experimental findings. Moreover, blocking suppression of renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) and/or increased secretion of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) during BAT markedly blunted the antihypertensive response in the virtual population. These data suggest that in obesity-mediated HTN, RSNA and ANP responses are key factors that contribute to BP lowering during BAT. This modeling approach may be of value in predicting BAT responses in future clinical studies."
https://openalex.org/W3212328927,"The work develops and investigates a mathematical model for evolution of the technological structure of an economic system where different technologies compete for the common essential resources. The model is represented by a system of consumer-resource rate equations. Consumers are technologies formalized as populations of weakly differentiated firms producing a similar commodity with like average output. Firms are characterized by the Leontief-Liebig production function in stock-flow representation. Firms self-replicate with a rate proportional to production output of the respective technology and dissolve with a constant rate of decay. The resources are supplied to the system from outside and consumed by concerned technologies; the unutilized resource amounts are removed elsewhere. The inverse of a per firm break-even resource availability is proposed to serve as a measure for competitiveness towards a given resource. The necessary conditions for coexistence of different technologies are derived, according to which each contender must be a superior competitor for one specific resource and an inferior competitor for the others. The model yields a version of the principle of competitive exclusion: in a steady state, the number of competing technologies cannot exceed the number of limiting resources. Competitive outcomes (either dominance or coexistence) in the general system of multiple technologies feeding on multiple essential resources are shown to be predictable from knowledge of the resource-dependent consumption and growth rates of each technological population taken alone. The proposed model of exploitative competition with explicit resource dynamics enables more profound insight into the patterns of technological change as opposed to conventional mainstream models of innovation diffusion."
https://openalex.org/W3212510134,"Understanding implications of passive smoke exposure during pregnancy is an important public health issue under the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease paradigm. In a prospective cohort of low-risk non-smoking pregnant women (NICHD Fetal Growth Studies-Singletons, 2009-2013, N = 2055), the association between first trimester passive smoke exposure and neonatal size was assessed by race/ethnicity. Plasma biomarker concentrations (cotinine, nicotine) assessed passive smoke exposure. Neonatal anthropometric measures included weight, 8 non-skeletal, and 2 skeletal measures. Linear regression evaluated associations between continuous biomarker concentrations and neonatal anthropometric measures by race/ethnicity. Cotinine concentrations were low and the percent above limit of quantification varied by maternal race/ethnicity (10% Whites; 14% Asians; 15% Hispanics; 49% Blacks). The association between cotinine concentration and infant weight differed by race/ethnicity (Pinteraction = 0.034); compared to women of the same race/ethnicity, per 1 log-unit increase in cotinine, weight increased 48g (95%CI -44, 139) in White and 51g (95%CI -81, 183) in Hispanic women, but decreased -90g (95%CI -490, 309) in Asian and -93g (95%CI -151, -35) in Black women. Consistent racial/ethnic differences and patterns were found for associations between biomarker concentrations and multiple non-skeletal measures for White and Black women (Pinteraction<0.1). Among Black women, an inverse association between cotinine concentration and head circumference was observed (-0.20g; 95%CI -0.38, -0.02). Associations between plasma cotinine concentration and neonatal size differed by maternal race/ethnicity, with increasing concentrations associated with decreasing infant size among Black women, who had the greatest biomarker concentrations. Public health campaigns should advocate for reducing pregnancy exposure, particularly for vulnerable populations."
https://openalex.org/W3212788912,"Scorpion venoms are mixtures of proteins, peptides and small molecular compounds with high specificity for ion channels and are therefore considered to be promising candidates in the venoms-to-drugs pipeline. Transcriptomes are important tools for studying the composition and expression of scorpion venom. Unfortunately, studying the venom gland transcriptome traditionally requires sacrificing the animal and therefore is always a single snapshot in time. This paper describes a new way of generating a scorpion venom gland transcriptome without sacrificing the animal, thereby allowing the study of the transcriptome at various time points within a single individual. By comparing these venom-derived transcriptomes to the traditional whole-telson transcriptomes we show that the relative expression levels of the major toxin classes are similar. We further performed a multi-day extraction using our proposed method to show the possibility of doing a multiple time point transcriptome analysis. This allows for the study of patterns of toxin gene activation over time a single individual, and allows assessment of the effects of diet, season and other factors that are known or likely to influence intraindividual venom composition. We discuss the gland characteristics that may allow this method to be successful in scorpions and provide a review of other venomous taxa to which this method may potentially be successfully applied."
https://openalex.org/W3214138808,"The objective was to investigate the persistence of sleep difficulties for over 16 years amongst a population of working age. In this prospective cohort study, a group-based trajectory analysis of repeated surveys amongst 66,948 employees in public sector (mean age 44.7 [SD 9.4] years, 80% women) was employed. The main outcome measure was sleep difficulties based on Jenkins Sleep Scale (JSS). Up to 70% of the respondents did not experience sleep difficulties whereas up to 4% reported high frequency of notable sleep difficulties through the entire 16-year follow-up. Heavy drinking predicted sleep difficulties (OR 2.3 95% CI 1.6 to 3.3) except for the respondents younger than 40 years. Smoking was associated with sleep difficulties amongst women younger than 40 years (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0 to 1.5). Obesity was associated with sleep difficulties amongst men (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.7) and women (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.3) of middle age and amongst women older than 50 (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2 to 1.8) years. Physical inactivity predicted sleep difficulties amongst older men (OR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.6). In this working-age population, sleep difficulties showed a great persistence over time. In most of the groups, the level of sleep difficulties during the follow-up was almost solely dependent on the level of initial severity. Depending on sex and age, increasing sleep problems were sometimes associated with high alcohol consumption, smoking, obesity and physical inactivity, but the strength of these associations varied."
https://openalex.org/W3214157482,"The levels of antigen-specific Antibodies in Lymphocyte Supernatant (ALS) using an ELISA are being used to evaluate mucosal immune responses as an alternate to measuring the number of Antibody Secreting Cells (ASCs) using an ELISpot assay. A recently completed trial of two novel S. sonnei live oral vaccine candidates WRSs2 and WRSs3 established that both candidates were safe, well tolerated and immunogenic in a vaccine dose-dependent manner. Previously, mucosal immune responses were measured by assaying IgA- and IgG-ASC in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In this report, the magnitude of the S. sonnei antigen-specific IgA- and IgG-ALS responses was measured and correlated with previously described ASCs, serum antibodies, fecal IgA and vaccine shedding. Overall, the magnitude of S. sonnei anti-Invaplex50 ALS was higher than that of LPS or IpaB, and both vaccines demonstrated a more robust IgA-ALS response than IgG; however, compared to WRSs3, the magnitude and percentage of responders were higher among WRSs2 recipients for IgA- or IgG-ALS. All WRSs2 vaccinees at the two highest doses responded for LPS and Invaplex50-specific IgA-ALS and 63-100% for WRSs3 vaccinees responded. Regardless of the vaccine candidate, vaccine dose or detecting antigen, the kinetics of ALS responses were similar peaking on days 7 to 9 and returning to baseline by day 14. The ALS responses were vaccine-specific since no responses were detected among placebo recipients at any time. A strong correlation and agreement between responders/non-responders were noted between ALS and other mucosal (ASC and fecal IgA) and systemic (serum antibody) immune responses. These data indicate that the ALS assay can be a useful tool to evaluate mucosal responses to oral vaccination, an observation noted with trials of other bacterial diarrheal pathogens. Furthermore, this data will guide the list of immunological assays to be conducted for efficacy trials in different populations. It is hoped that an antigen-specific-ALS titer may be a key mucosal correlate of protection, a feature not currently available for any Shigella vaccines candidates. https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01336699."
https://openalex.org/W3214220292,"The diversity of bacteriophages is likely unparalleled in the biome due to the immense variety of hosts and the multitude of viruses that infect them. Recent efforts have led to description at the genomic level of numerous bacteriophages that infect the Actinobacteria, but relatively little is known about those infecting other prokaryotic phyla, such as the purple non-sulfur photosynthetic α-proteobacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus. This species is a common inhabitant of freshwater ecosystems and has been an important model system for the study of photosynthesis. Additionally, it is notable for its utilization of a unique form of horizontal gene transfer via a bacteriophage-like element known as the gene transfer agent (RcGTA). Only three bacteriophages of R. capsulatus had been sequenced prior to this report. Isolation and characterization at the genomic level of 26 new bacteriophages infecting this host advances the understanding of bacteriophage diversity and the origins of RcGTA. These newly discovered isolates can be grouped along with three that were previously sequenced to form six clusters with four remaining as single representatives. These bacteriophages share genes with RcGTA that seem to be related to host recognition. One isolate was found to cause lysis of a marine bacterium when exposed to high-titer lysate. Although some clusters are more highly represented in the sequenced genomes, it is evident that many more bacteriophage types that infect R. capsulatus are likely to be found in the future."
https://openalex.org/W3214327699,"The current Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccine provides inconsistent protection against pulmonary infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Immunity induced by subcutaneous immunization with BCG wanes and does not promote early recruitment of T cell to the lungs after M. tuberculosis infection. Delivery of Tuberculosis (TB) vaccines to the lungs may increase and prolong immunity at the primary site of M. tuberculosis infection. Pulmonary immunization with recombinant influenza A viruses (rIAVs) expressing an immune-dominant M. tuberculosis CD4+ T cell epitope (PR8-p25 and X31-p25) stimulates protective immunity against lung TB infection. Here, we investigated the potential use of rIAVs to improve the efficacy of BCG using simultaneous immunization (SIM) and prime-boost strategies. SIM with parenteral BCG and intranasal PR8-p25 resulted in equivalent protection to BCG alone against early, acute and chronic M. tuberculosis infection. Boosting BCG with rIAVs increased the frequency of IFN-γ-secreting specific T cells (p<0.001) and polyfunctional CD4+ T cells (p<0.05) in the lungs compared to the BCG alone, however, this did not result in a significant increase in protection against M. tuberculosis compared to BCG alone. Therefore, sequential pulmonary immunization with these rIAVs after BCG increased M. tuberculosis-specific memory T cell responses in the lung, but not protection against M. tuberculosis infection."

https://openalex.org/W3211955791,"Nitrate transport in cyanobacteria is mediated by ABC-transporter, which consists of a highly conserved ATP binding cassette (ABC) and a less conserved transmembrane domain (TMD). Under salt stress, recombinant glycinebetaine (GB) not only protected the rate of nitrate transport in transgenic Anabaena PCC 7120, rather stimulated the rate by interacting with the ABC-transporter proteins. In silico analyses revealed that nrtA protein consisted of 427 amino acids, the majority of which were hydrophobic and contained a Tat (twin-arginine translocation) signal profile of 34 amino acids (1-34). The nrtC subunit of 657 amino acids contained two hydrophobic distinct domains; the N-terminal (5-228 amino acids), which was 59% identical to nrtD (the ATP-binding subunit) and the C-terminal (268-591), 28.2% identical to nrtA, suggesting C-terminal as a solute binding domain and N-terminal as ATP binding domain. Subunit nrtD consisted of 277 amino acids and its N-terminal (21-254) was an ATP binding motif. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that nitrate-ABC-transporter proteins are highly conserved among the cyanobacterial species, though variation existed in sequences resulting in several subclades. Nostoc PCC 7120 was very close to Anabaena variabilis ATCC 29413, Anabaena sp. 4-3 and Anabaena sp. CA = ATCC 33047. On the other, Nostoc spp. NIES-3756 and PCC 7524 were often found in the same subclade suggesting more work before referring it to Anabaena PCC 7120 or Nostoc PCC 7120.

https://openalex.org/W3212385446,"This work introduces a novel analytical chemistry method potentially applicable to the study of archaeological starch residues. The investigation involved the laboratory synthesis of model Maillard reaction mixtures and their analysis through Fourier-Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry (FTICR-MS). Thus, starch from sixteen plant species were matured while reacting it with the amino acid glycine. The FTICR-MS analysis revealed > 5,300 molecular compounds, with numerous unique heteroatom rich compound classes, ranging from 20 (Zea mays) to 50 (Sorghum bicolor). These classes were investigated as repositories of chemical structure retaining source and process-specific character, linked back to botanical provenance. We discussed the Maillard reaction products thus generated, a possible pathway for the preservation of degraded starch, while also assessing diagenetic recalcitrance and adsorption potential to mineral surfaces. In some cases, hydrothermal experimentation on starches without glycine reveals that the chemical complexity of the starch itself is sufficient to produce some Maillard reaction products. The article concludes that FTICR-MS offers a new analytical window to characterize starchy residue and its diagenetic products, and is able to recognize taxonomic signals with the potential to persist in fossil contexts."
https://openalex.org/W3212389161,"In dynamic driving simulators, the experience of operating a vehicle is reproduced by combining visual stimuli generated by graphical rendering with inertial stimuli generated by platform motion. Due to inherent limitations of the platform workspace, inertial stimulation is subject to shortcomings in the form of missing cues, false cues, and/or scaling errors, which negatively affect simulation fidelity. In the present study, we aim at quantifying the relative contribution of an active somatosensory stimulation to the perceived intensity of self-motion, relative to other sensory systems. Participants judged the intensity of longitudinal and lateral driving maneuvers in a dynamic driving simulator in passive driving conditions, with and without additional active somatosensory stimulation, as provided by an Active Seat (AS) and Active Belts (AB) integrated system (ASB). The results show that ASB enhances the perceived intensity of sustained decelerations, and increases the precision of acceleration perception overall. Our findings are consistent with models of perception, and indicate that active somatosensory stimulation can indeed be used to improve simulation fidelity."

https://openalex.org/W3213176236,"The aim of this study was to obtain a holistic understanding of pre-service teachers' enthusiasm for teaching (a subject) by examining its structure as well as relevant factors that may be related to it in the first phase of teacher education. For this purpose, we considered two strands of research: educational science and organizational psychology. Accordingly, the professional competence model and the job demands and resources model helped to identify factors that are associated with pre-service teachers' enthusiasm for teaching. Responses of 211 pre-service biology teachers indicated that enthusiasm for teaching can be considered as one-dimensional. Moreover, we found positive relationships between enthusiasm for teaching and academic self-concept, intrinsic career choice motives and occupational commitment. In contrast, we detected negative relations between enthusiasm for teaching and both emotional exhaustion and intention to quit. No significant relations could be found for enthusiasm for teaching and both professional knowledge and extrinsic career choice motives. Our findings highlight the importance of enthusiasm for teaching in the earliest stage of teachers' careers. Thus, our study points out relevant factors that could help to maintain high enthusiasm and to keep (pre-service) teachers healthy and in the profession."
https://openalex.org/W3213265400,"Capacitation is a complex maturation process mammalian sperm must undergo in the female genital tract to be able to fertilize an egg. This process involves, amongst others, physiological changes in flagellar beating pattern, membrane potential, intracellular ion concentrations and protein phosphorylation. Typically, in a capacitation medium, only a fraction of sperm achieve this state. The cause for this heterogeneous response is still not well understood and remains an open question. Here, one of our principal results is to develop a discrete regulatory network, with mostly deterministic dynamics in conjunction with some stochastic elements, for the main biochemical and biophysical processes involved in the early events of capacitation. The model criterion for capacitation requires the convergence of specific levels of a select set of nodes. Besides reproducing several experimental results and providing some insight on the network interrelations, the main contribution of the model is the suggestion that the degree of variability in the total amount and individual number of ion transporters among spermatozoa regulates the fraction of capacitated spermatozoa. This conclusion is consistent with recently reported experimental results. Based on this mathematical analysis, experimental clues are proposed for the control of capacitation levels. Furthermore, cooperative and interference traits that become apparent in the modelling among some components also call for future theoretical and experimental studies."

https://openalex.org/W3213437909,"Tree ring features are affected by environmental factors and therefore are the basis for dendrochronological studies to reconstruct past environmental conditions. Oak wood often provides the data for these studies because of the durability of oak heartwood and hence the availability of samples spanning long time periods of the distant past. Wood formation is regulated in part by epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation. Studies of the methylation state of DNA preserved in oak heartwood thus could identify epigenetic tree ring features informing on past environmental conditions. In this study, we aimed to establish protocols for the extraction of DNA, the high-throughput sequencing of whole-genome DNA libraries (WGS) and the profiling of DNA methylation by whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) for oak (Quercus robur) heartwood drill cores taken from the trunks of living standing trees spanning the AD 1776-2014 time period. Heartwood contains little DNA, and large amounts of phenolic compounds known to hinder the preparation of high-throughput sequencing libraries. Whole-genome and DNA methylome library preparation and sequencing consistently failed for oak heartwood samples more than 100 and 50 years of age, respectively. DNA fragmentation increased with sample age and was exacerbated by the additional bisulfite treatment step during methylome library preparation. Relative coverage of the non-repetitive portion of the oak genome was sparse. These results suggest that quantitative methylome studies of oak hardwood will likely be limited to relatively recent samples and will require a high sequencing depth to achieve sufficient genome coverage."

This study aimed to identify the effects of widely known risk factors on AF incidence according to age and to elucidate the clinical implications of these effects.We analyzed data from 501,668 subjects (≥18years old) without AF and valvular heart disease from the Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort. The total population was divided into two groups according to age, <60years and ≥60years. AF occurred in 0.7% of the overall population (3,416 of 501,668) during the follow-up period (mean 47.6 months). In Cox regression analysis, age, male sex, previous ischemic stroke, heart failure, and hypertension were related to increased risk of new-onset AF in both age groups. Especially in the <60years age group, risk of new-onset AF was increased by relatively modifiable risk factors: obesity (body mass index ≥25kg/m2; hazard ratio[HR] 1.37 [1.22-1.55], p<0.001, interaction p<0.001), and hypertension (HR 1.93[1.69-2.22], p<0.001, interaction p<0.001). Although interactions were not significant, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 1.41[1.24-1.60], p<0.001) and chronic kidney disease (HR 1.28[1.15-1.41], p<0.001) showed increased trends of the risk of new-onset AF in the ≥60years age group.The risk profile for new-onset AF was somewhat different between the <60years and the ≥60years age groups. Compared to the ≥60years group, relatively modifiable risk factors (such as obesity and hypertension) had a greater impact on AF incidence in the <60years age group. Different management strategies to prevent AF development according to age may be needed."

Then, based on the hypothesis of small deformations, two strain state expressions, the linear strain expression method (LSEM) and shear strain expression method (SSEM), were established for incompressible materials with only linear strain and shear strain as parameters respectively. Furthermore, conditions, implementation steps and specific forms for the application of SSEM in 1D, 2D and 3D strain states are obtained. As an example, two representations based on tetragonal pyramid and rotating tetrahedron are especially given. Therefore, conventional strain representation methods can be expressed as a combination of line strains in a certain direction or a combination of characteristic shear strains. The results of this paper provide a new way for understanding deformation characteristics, revealing yielding process, establishing constitutive models, and developing testing apparatus or equipment."

However, RPM from the clam at an aquaculture farm in Zhoushan, China, has been newly reported as a promising natural bioflocculant resource that contains effective flocculating polysaccharides from the clam associated bacteria. With an intent to figure out whether RPM flocculation activity is ubiquitous to the manila clam across a wide geographical range or only the Zhoushan location, and to explore the flocculation production basis and ultimately widen its exploitation scope, in this study, an extensive survey of RPMs from four representative locations along the coast of China was performed to determine their flocculation activity, polysaccharide constitution and bacterial community composition. Frozen preserved RPM samples from Zhoushan, Dalian, Weihai and Zhanjiang exhibited comparable flocculation activities (FRs) ranging from 61.9±2.4% to 73.2±0.9% at dosage of 8 g·L-1; while fresh RPMs from Zhoushan exhibited a much higher flocculation activity of 91.34±1.18% than its frozen counterpart. Polysaccharide extracts from the four locations showed similar monosaccharide constitutions to some extent. The geographical distribution led to certain variation in bacterial community structures. The similarity clustering of the polysaccharide compositions coincided with that of bacterial community structures from RPMs, suggesting that polysaccharides and respective bacterial communities might be the foundation of the flocculation activity for all RPMs. The overlapping OTUs across all the RPMs accounted for 44.6-62.22% of the overall sequences in each sample and contained the vast majority of the most abundant OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units), forming a common ""core microbiome"" that is probably responsible for polysaccharide production and flocculation activity development."

In this article we further assess the mechanism underlying this deficit, by assessing the degree to which we can model it in young adults under conditions of divided attention. We shall describe two experiments in this paper; these experiments investigate item and associative recognition in young adults under full- or divided-attention conditions. The secondary tasks employed were N-back like (NBL), which serves as a working memory updating task, and parity judgement and visuospatial (VS) tasks, which serve as non-working memory tasks. The results of both experiments show that only the NBL specifically affected associative recognition, while the other tasks affected item and associative memory to the same degree, indicating a general resource competition. These results presented a convergence of evidence for the associative deficit in older adults by modelling it in young adults."

However, little is known about the mechanism of the flower bud development in walnut. Here, the stages of walnut female flower bud development were divided into five period (P01-05) by using histological observation. They were further studied through PacBio Iso-Seq and RNA-seq analysis. Accordingly, we obtained 52,875 full-length transcripts, where 4,579 were new transcripts, 3,065 were novel genes, 1,437 were consensus lncRNAs and 20,813 were alternatively spliced isoforms. These transcripts greatly improved the current genome annotation and enhanced our understanding of the walnut transcriptome. Next, RNA sequencing of female flower buds at five periods revealed that circadian rhythm-plant was commonly enriched along with the flower bud developmental gradient. A total of 14 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, and six of them were confirmed by real-time quantitative analysis. Additionally, six and two differentially expressed clock genes were detected to be regulated by AS events and lncRNAs, respectively. All these detected plant circadian genes form a complex interconnected network to regulate the flower bud development. Thus, investigation of key genes associated with the circadian clock could clarify the process of flower bud development in walnut."
https://openalex.org/W3214271028,"Single-cell red microalga Porphyridium cruentum is potentially considered to be the bioresource for biofuel and pharmaceutical production. Nitrogen is a kind of nutrient component for photosynthetic P . cruentum . Meanwhile, nitrogen stress could induce to accumulate some substances such as lipid and phycoerythrin and affect its growth and physiology. However, how marine microalga Porphyridium cruentum respond and adapt to nitrogen starvation remains elusive. Here, acclimation of the metabolic reprogramming to changes in the nutrient environment was studied by high-throughput mRNA sequencing in the unicellular red alga P . cruentum . Firstly, to reveal transcriptional regulation, de novo transcriptome was assembled and 8,244 unigenes were annotated based on different database. Secondly, under nitrogen deprivation, 2100 unigenes displayed differential expression (1134 upregulation and 966 downregulation, respectively) and some pathways including carbon/nitrogen metabolism, photosynthesis, and lipid metabolism would be reprogrammed in P . cruentum . The result demonstrated that nitrate assimilation (with related unigenes of 8–493 fold upregulation) would be strengthen and photosynthesis (with related unigenes of 6–35 fold downregulation) be impaired under nitrogen deprivation. Importantly, compared to other green algae, red microalga P . cruentum presented a different expression pattern of lipid metabolism in response to nitrogen stress. These observations will also provide novel insight for understanding adaption mechanisms and potential targets for metabolic engineering and synthetic biology in P . cruentum ."

Improving the understanding of the mechanisms and the drivers of the projection uncertainties can help to improve decisions. Previous studies have provided important insights, but often sample only a small subset of potentially important uncertainties. Here we expand on a previous statistical modeling approach by refining the analyses of two uncertainty sources. Specifically, we assess the effects of uncertainties surrounding crop-yield model parameters and climate forcings on projected crop yield. We focus on maize yield projections in the eastern U.S.in this century. We quantify how considering more uncertainties expands the lower tail of yield projections. We characterized the relative importance of each uncertainty source and show that the uncertainty surrounding yield model parameters is the main driver of yield projection uncertainty."
