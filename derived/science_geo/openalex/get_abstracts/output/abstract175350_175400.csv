It consists of two subunits, HIF-1α, which is degraded during normoxia, and HIF-1β, which is constitutively expressed. Activated HIF-1 induces the expression of genes involved in angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, and glucose metabolism. We have previously reported that insulin stimulates vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression (1Treins C. Giorgetti-Peraldi S. Murdaca J. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43836-43841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). In this study, we show that insulin activates HIF-1, leading to VEGF expression in retinal epithelial cells. Insulin activates HIF-1α protein expression in a dose-dependent manner with a maximum reached within 6 h. The expression of HIF-1α is correlated with the activation of HIF-1 DNA binding activity and the transactivation of a HIF-1-dependent reporter gene. Insulin does not appear to affect HIF-1α mRNA transcription but regulates HIF-1α protein expression through a translation-dependent pathway. The expression of an active form of protein kinase B and treatment of cells with specific inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), MAPK, and target of rapamycin (TOR) show that mainly PI3K and to a lesser extent TOR are required for insulin-induced HIF-1α expression. HIF-1 activity and VEGF expression are also dependent on PI3K- and TOR-dependent signaling. In conclusion, we show here that insulin regulates HIF-1 action through a PI3K/TOR-dependent pathway, resulting in increased VEGF expression.

Following ligand binding, the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase is activated, leading to receptor autophosphorylation and the subsequent phosphorylation of intracellular proteins including insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 and Shc. These initial events stimulate multiple signaling cascades that mediate cellular responses to the hormone (2Withers D.J. White M. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 1917-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Among the substrates of the insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrates 1 and 2 are involved mainly in the activation of the PI3K1 pathway, whereas Shc participates in the activation of the Ras/MAPK cascade. The Ras/MAPK and PI3K pathways have been implicated in insulin-induced gene transcription (3Saltiel A.R. Pessin J.E.

The activated MAPK phosphorylates transcription factors such as p62TCF involved in the transcription of genes that are implicated in proliferation and differentiation in response to insulin (5Saltiel A.R. Kahn C.R. Nature. 2001; 414: 799-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (3973) Google Scholar). In contrast, insulin regulates the expression of genes involved in glucose metabolism through a PI3K-dependent pathway. Thus, insulin inhibits the transcription of genes encoding PEPCK, the rate-limiting enzyme in gluconeogenesis, and glucose-6-phosphatase through a PI3K pathway (6Sutherland C. O'Brien R.M.

Furthermore, a PI3K-dependent pathway is involved in the regulation of gene expression of lipogenic enzymes by insulin such as FAS (fatty-acid synthase) (8Wang D. Sul H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25420-25426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Finally, insulin also regulates the expression of genes implicated in the angiogenic response such as erythropoietin (EPO) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), but the molecular details of this action are lacking (9Masuda S. Chikuma M. Sasaki R. Brain Res. 1997; 746: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 10Lu M. Amano S. Miyamoto K. Garland R. Keough K. Qin W. Adamis A.P. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1999; 40: 3281-3286PubMed Google Scholar). VEGF is a key angiogenic factor involved in a wide variety of biological processes including embryonic development, wound healing, tumor progression, and metastasis. VEGF has emerged as a major mediator of intraocular neovascularization and as such plays a key role in the etiology of diabetic retinopathy (11Duh E. Aiello L.P. Diabetes. 1999; 48: 1899-1906Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Indeed, it has been observed that intraocular VEGF levels are increased in diabetic patients suffering from proliferative retinopathy (12Funatsu H. Yamashita H. Noma H. Shimizu E. Yamashita T. Hori S. Jpn. J. Ophthalmol. 2001; 45: 577-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). VEGF expression is mainly regulated by tissue oxygen content (13Ikeda E. Achen M.G. Breier G. Risau W. J.

Hypoxia stimulates VEGF expression through at least three mechanisms including increased gene transcription, regulation at the translational level, and mRNA stabilization (14Levy A.P. Levy N.S.

Biol. 1995; 15: 5363-5368Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The transcriptional regulation of VEGF is mediated by the transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) (22Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21513-21518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Semenza G.L. Curr. Opin. Genet.

HIF-1 is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor, which is composed of two subunits, HIF-1α and HIF-1β. HIF-1β, also known as the arylhydrocarbon nuclear translocator, is constitutively expressed, whereas HIF-1α expression is increased upon hypoxia. In normoxia, HIF-1α is rapidly ubiquitinated by the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor E3 ligase complex and subjected to proteasomal degradation (25Jaakkola P. Mole D.R. Tian Y.M. Wilson M.I. Gielbert J. Gaskell S.J. Kriegsheim A. Hebestreit H.F. Mukherji M. Schofield C.J. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Science. 2001; 292: 468-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (4489) Google Scholar). Under hypoxic conditions, HIF-1α is not degraded and accumulates to form an active complex with HIF-1β. HIF-1 regulates the transcription of numerous genes involved in vascular development (VEGF, EPO, and heme oxygenase 1), in glucose and energy metabolism (glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes), in iron metabolism (transferrin), and in cell proliferation and viability (insulin-like growth factor-2 and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1). It has been shown that insulin increases VEGF expression through a PI3K-dependent pathway in fibroblasts overexpressing insulin receptors (18Miele C. Rochford J.J. Filippa N. Giorgetti-Peraldi S. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21695-21702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, the identity and regulation of the transcription factor involved in this process remain unknown. Here we report that insulin stimulates HIF-1α subunit accumulation, HIF-1 activation, and VEGF expression. Our results show that insulin regulates HIF-1α expression through a translation-dependent pathway. Moreover, insulin-induced HIF-1 regulation and VEGF expression require a PI3K/TOR-dependent pathway. cDNA for VEGF165 was obtained from J. Plouet (Toulouse, France). Insulin was a kind gift from Novo-Nordisk (Copenhagen, Denmark). The antibody to HIF-1α (clone H1α67) was purchased from Novus Biologicals, Inc. (Littleton, CO). The antibody to Shc was obtained from BD Transduction Laboratories (Franklin Lakes, NJ). The antibody to phospho-PKB (Ser-473) was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The antibody to MEK-1 is directed against the 17-amino acid amino-terminal of MEK-1 (26Frodin M. Peraldi P. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6207-6214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All of the chemical reagents were purchased from Sigma. U0126 was purchased from Promega Inc. (Madison, WI). Oligonucleotides and culture media were purchased from Invitrogen. Arising retinal pigment epithelia cell line-19 (ARPE-19, ATCC CRL-2302) was grown in F12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen) at 37 °C with 5% CO2. pGL2 basic P12 VEGF promoter corresponds to nucleotides from −1005 to −906 of the human VEGF promoter cloned upstream of a luciferase-coding sequence (27Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3234) Google Scholar). The construct PKB-myr (constitutively active form of PKB) was a gift from B. Hemmings (F. Miescher Institute, Basel, Switzerland) (28Andjelkovic M. Alessi D.R. Meier R. Fernandez A. Lamb N.J.

Gremeaux T. Grillo S. Calleja V. Klippel A. Williams L.T. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. J. Biol.

ARPE-19 cells were transiently transfected using the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) according to manufacturer's instructions. Sixteen hours after the addition of DNA, F12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum was changed, and before being stimulated, the cells were incubated for an additional 16 h with F12/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) was used to extract total cellular RNA from confluent cells grown in 100-mm tissue culture plates according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were serum-deprived overnight in medium containing 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, and cells were pretreated with or not with inhibitors for 30 min and stimulated for the indicated lengths of time. RNA was extracted, and 10 μg of total RNA were denatured in formamide and formaldehyde and separated by electrophoresis in formaldehyde-containing agarose gels. RNA was transferred to Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Biosciences) and cross-linked to the membrane by UV radiation. Human VEGF cDNA fragment or a PCR product encoding amino acids 330–528 of human HIF-1α was used as a probe (30Laughner E. Taghavi P. Chiles K. Mahon P.C. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3995-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar). The probes were labeled with [γ-32P]dCTP by random priming using the Rediprime kit (Amersham Biosciences) and purified with the Probequant kit (AmershamBiosciences). The hybridizations were performed at 42 °C in NorthernMax hybridization buffer (Ambion, Inc, Austin, TX). The membranes were washed in 1× SSC, 0.5% (w/v) SDS, and radioactivity was quantitated using a Storm 840 (Amersham Biosciences). Serum-starved cells were treated with ligands, chilled to 4 °C, and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (140 mm NaCl, 3 mmKCl, 6 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4) and solubilized with lysis buffer (50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 10 mmNa4P2O7, 100 mm NaF, 2 mm vanadate, 1 mm4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100) for 20 min at 4 °C. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred by electroblotting to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond-C,Amersham Biosciences). The membranes were soaked first in blocking buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) containing 5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin or nonfat milk and second in blocking buffer containing antibodies. After the washes, the proteins were detected using horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibodies and enhanced chemiluminescence according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (1Treins C. Giorgetti-Peraldi S. Murdaca J. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43836-43841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Sense and antisense oligonucleotides corresponding to the HIF-1 binding site in the human EPO gene, 5′-GATCGCCCTACGTGCTGTCTCA-3′, were used (31Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). The oligonucleotides were annealed, and the double-stranded oligonucleotide (10 pmol) was labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]dATP. The probe was purified with the Probequant kit. Binding reactions were performed as described previously (32Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2224) Google Scholar). The reactions contained 10 μg of nuclear extract and 0.1 μg of denatured salmon sperm DNA (Sigma) in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mmdithiothreitol, and 5% (v/v) glycerol. After preincubation for 5 min at room temperature, the probe (2.5 × 105 cpm) was added, and the incubation was continued for an additional 15 min, after which the reaction mixtures were loaded onto 5% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels. Electrophoresis was performed at 185 V in 0.25× Tris borate EDTA (22.25 mm Tris-HCl, 22.25 mmboric acid, and 1.25 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. The gels were vacuum-dried, and radioactivity was determined on a Storm 840. The nuclear extracts were prepared using a nuclear extract kit (Active Motif Europe, Rixensart, Belgium) according to manufacturer's instructions. HIF-1 binding to the hypoxia response element was assessed using Trans-AM HIF transcription factor assay kit (Active Motif Europe). In this assay, an oligonucleotide containing the HIF-1 binding site from the EPO gene is attached to a 96-well plate. The active form of HIF-1 contained in cell extracts specifically binds to this oligonucleotide and can be revealed by incubation with antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technology with absorbance reading. 10 μg of nuclear extract were analyzed for HIF-1 binding to the oligonucleotide according to the manufacturer's instructions. The specificity for this assay was monitored by competition with free wild type or mutated oligonucleotide according to the manufacturer's instructions. To assay the transcriptional activity of HIF-1, we used the pGL2 basic P12 VEGF promoter vector, which contains a HIF-1 binding site (from −975 to −968) downstream from the luciferase gene (27Forsythe J.A. Jiang B.H. Iyer N.V. Agani F. Leung S.W. Koos R.D. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (3234) Google Scholar). ARPE cells in 12-wells plates were transiently co-transfected with the reporter plasmid and with Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase as a control for transfection efficiency. The cells were stimulated for 16 h, and luciferase assays were performed as described in the protocols and applications guide (Promega). The luciferase activity was measured using a chemiluminometer Wallac 1420 (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The β-galactosidase activity was performed as described in the Promega's protocols and applications guide. Cells lysates were incubated with a 2× assay buffer (200 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 2 mm MgCl2, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 1.33 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl β-d-galactopyranoside). The absorbance at 420 nm was measured with a spectrophotometer Wallac 1420. We have previously shown that insulin induces VEGF expression in cell culture and in intact animals (1Treins C. Giorgetti-Peraldi S. Murdaca J. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43836-43841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To study the effect of the hormone on the transcription factor HIF-1, we first investigated the insulin effect on HIF-1α protein expression. ARPE-19 cells were treated for 4 h with insulin or with cobalt chloride (CoCl2) as a positive control. Whole cell lysates and nuclear extracts were analyzed by Western blotting using an antibody to HIF-1α (Fig. 1, A andB). The divalent metal CoCl2 is known to induce HIF-1α expression, HIF-1 DNA binding activity, and transactivation of HIF-1 target genes (33Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. Blood. 1993; 82: 3610-3615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 34Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5510-5514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5105) Google Scholar, 35Jiang B.H. Zheng J.Z. Leung S.W. Roe R. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19253-19260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, 36Pugh C.W. O'Rourke J.F. Nagao M. Gleadle J.M. Ratcliffe P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11205-11214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Indeed, the CoCl2 treatment of cells led to an accumulation of HIF-1α in ARPE-19 cells. Insulin induces HIF-1α expression in both whole cell lysates and in nuclear extracts. As observed in Fig. 1, C and D, HIF-1α expression was induced by 0.1 nm insulin, and the maximal induction was seen at 100 nm. The expression of HIF-1α was transiently detectable within 1 h and maximal within 6 h and then returned to basal levels within 24 h of treatment. These results show that the incubation of ARPE-19 cells with insulin results in a time- and concentration-dependent elevation of HIF-1α protein levels. We next determined whether insulin-induced HIF-1α accumulation was correlated with an activation of the transcription factor HIF-1. To do this, we measured the ability of HIF-1 to bind to DNA and to transactivate a HIF-1-dependent reporter gene. ARPE-19 cells were treated for 4 h with insulin or CoCl2, and the nuclear extracts were isolated. A double-stranded oligonucleotide containing the HIF-1 binding site present in the EPO gene was used as a probe in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (Fig.2 A). Both insulin and CoCl2 induced a shift of the labeled probe. This binding was verified by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test using an immobilized oligonucleotide to assess HIF-1 DNA binding activity (Fig.2 B). HIF-1 DNA binding activity was stimulated after 4 h of insulin or CoCl2 treatment. The specificity of HIF-1 binding was tested by competition with free oligonucleotides. The binding was specific, because it was abolished in the presence of an excess of wild type oligonucleotide, whereas the mutated oligonucleotide had no effect. We next measured the transcriptional activity of HIF-1 using a SV40 promoter-luciferase unit downstream of a 99-bp hypoxia response element (pGL2 basic P12 VEGF promoter) relative to co-transfected Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase (Fig. 2 C). After 16 h of insulin or CoCl2 treatment, the luciferase activity in cell extracts was determined and normalized to the β-galactosidase activity. Insulin and CoCl2 induced a statistically significant 1.55- and 3.5-fold increase (±0.0864 and ±0.375, respectively) in luciferase activity, respectively. Therefore, the accumulation of HIF-1α subunit induced by insulin can be correlated with the activation of the transcription factor HIF-1. To obtain a better understanding of the processes involved in HIF-1α accumulation in response to insulin treatment, we investigated the effect of insulin on the amount of HIF-1α mRNA. ARPE-19 cells were stimulated with insulin or CoCl2 for 6 h, RNA was extracted, and Northern blot analysis was performed using a HIF-1α cDNA probe (Fig. 3 A). We found that insulin or CoCl2 treatment did not modify HIF-1α mRNA expression, suggesting that insulin does not regulate HIF-1α mRNA transcription. HIF-1α has been shown to be degraded through the proteasome pathway during normoxia. Therefore, to study the effect of insulin on HIF-1α degradation, we looked at the effect of a specific inhibitor of proteasome, MG132 (Fig. 3 B). ARPE-19 cells were incubated with insulin in the absence or presence of MG132. After 4 h, insulin was removed, and the level of HIF-1α protein was evaluated by Western blot using a HIF-1α antibody. As expected, in the absence of MG132, insulin induced an accumulation of HIF-1α. Within 15 min after the removal of insulin, a decrease in HIF-1α protein could be seen, and HIF-1α was undetectable 30 min after withdrawal of the hormone. We observed that the inhibition of the proteasome by MG132 led to a high level of expression of HIF-1α, even in the absence of insulin stimulation. This elevated the expression of HIF-1α in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor, preventing us from detecting any effect of insulin on HIF-1α degradation. To analyze the insulin effect on HIF-1α synthesis, we performed a time course of HIF-1α disappearance in the presence of the protein translation inhibitor, cycloheximide (Fig. 3 C). To this end, ARPE-19 cells were treated with insulin or CoCl2 for 4 h, and cycloheximide was added for 15–60 min. In cells exposed to CoCl2, HIF-1α level remained constant over 60 min despite the lack of ongoing protein synthesis. This observation is consistent with previous studies showing that CoCl2 had no effect on HIF-1α synthesis but blocked its degradation. In ARPE-19 cells treated with insulin, the addition of cycloheximide led to a decrease in HIF-1α expression starting at 15 min. After 60 min, HIF-1α was no longer detectable. Together, these results suggest that insulin increases HIF-1α protein levels through a translation-dependent pathway. We investigated the role of MEK- and PKB-dependent pathways in the regulation of HIF-1α in ARPE-19 cells. To this end, we transfected ARPE-19 cells with pcDNA3 as a control with a constitutively active form of MEK (MEK*) or with a PKB-myr. The transfected cells were treated or not treated with insulin (100 nm), and whole cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting using antibody to HIF-1α (Fig. 4). The expression of MEK* did not affect the amount of HIF-1α protein compared with control conditions. However, the expression of PKB-myr is sufficient to increase the HIF-1α protein level in basal conditions. In addition, when PKB-myr is expressed, insulin treatment does not further increase the level of HIF-1α protein. To further evaluate the contribution of the PI3K pathway to the regulation of HIF-1α protein levels, we used the pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K and of a downstream effector, TOR. ARPE-19 cells were treated for 4 h with CoCl2 or with insulin in the absence or presence of the inhibitors of PI3K (LY294002), TOR (rapamycin), or MEK (U0126). Whole cell lysates and nuclear extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies to HIF-1α, Shc, or CREB (Fig.5 A). In agreement with the results obtained in Fig. 4, insulin increased HIF-1α expression. This increase was not affected by pretreatment with the MEK inhibitor U0126. Rather, the inhibition of PI3K activation by LY249002 totally blocked the expression of HIF-1α in response to insulin in both total cell lysates and in nuclear extracts. In addition, the treatment with rapamycin decreased HIF-1α protein after insulin stimulation by half the level. We confirmed that insulin-induced activation of PI3K, MAPK, and TOR was blocked by treatment with the respective inhibitor (data not shown). To determine whether these inhibitors blocked HIF-1 activity, we measured the DNA binding activity of HIF-1 using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test. ARPE-19 cells were stimulated with insulin in the absence or presence of LY294002, rapamycin, or U0126 (Fig.5 B). Insulin induced a 3-fold increase in DNA binding activity of HIF-1. The inhibition of PI3K by LY294002 totally blocked HIF-1 activation, whereas the inhibition of TOR by rapamycin induced a 40% decrease in insulin-induced HIF-1 activation. As expected, MEK does not appear to be involved, because the inhibition of MEK by U0126 had no effect on HIF-1 activity in response to insulin. Thus, the extent of inhibition of HIF-1α expression by the inhibitors tightly correlated with their ability to block insulin-induced DNA binding activity of HIF-1. To examine whether this correlation could be extended to the HIF-1 activation and VEGF mRNA expression in response to insulin, we analyzed the VEGF mRNA expression profile after treatment with these inhibitors. ARPE-19 cells were treated with CoCl2 or with insulin in the absence or presence of LY294002, U0126, or rapamycin. RNA was extracted, and Northern blot analyses were performed using a VEGF165 cDNA probe (Fig.6). Insulin and CoCl2 induced a 3- and 5-fold increase in VEGF mRNA expression, respectively. The inhibition of PI3K blocked the insulin-induced VEGF mRNA expression. Moreover, rapamycin treatment resulted in a 40% inhibition. In contrast, blocking MEK did not affect the ability of insulin to induce VEGF mRNA expression in these cells. In summary, the insulin-induced accumulation of the HIF-1α subunit appears to be dependent on the PI3K/TOR pathway. This accumulation leads to HIF-1 transcriptional activity and VEGF mRNA expression. Diabetic retinopathy is the major cause of blindness in Western countries. VEGF is involved in the pathogenesis of both background and proliferative retinopathy. Intraocular VEGF is increased in eyes from patients with blood-retinal barrier breakdown and neovascularization. Clinical studies have demonstrated that long term insulin therapy reduces the risk of diabetic retinopathy progression. However, it has also been observed that intensive insulin therapy leads to a transient worsening of retinopathy characterized by a blood-retinal barrier breakdown (37Agardh C.D. Eckert B. Agardh E. J. Diabetes Complications. 1992; 6: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 38Brinchmann-Hansen O. Dahl-Jorgensen K. Sandvik L. Hanssen K.F. Br. Med.

J Diabetes Complications. 1994; 8: 45-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the worsening of retinopathy could be attributed to chronic hyperinsulinemia induced by insulin treatment. Indeed, it has been shown that insulin stimulates VEGF expression, which in turn would stimulate neovascularization (40Poulaki V. Qin W. Joussen A.M. Hurlbut P. Weigand S.J. Rudge J. Yancopoulos G.D. Adamis A.P. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 109: 805-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar,41Zelzer E. Levy Y. Kahana C. Shilo B.Z. Rubinstein M. Cohen B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5085-5094Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms involved in insulin-induced VEGF expression remain unknown. In this study, we show that insulin stimulates VEGF expression through the activation of the transcription factor HIF-1. This activation is regulated by a PI3K-dependent signaling pathway involving TOR. Moreover, in contrast to hypoxia, which is a major activator of HIF-1, insulin does not regulate HIF-1α through the inhibition of its degradation but through a translation-dependent mechanism. In ARPE-19 cells, insulin stimulates the accumulation of the regulated subunit HIF-1α. An increase in HIF-1α expression is directly correlated with the activity of the transcription factor HIF-1. Indeed, we show that insulin induces increased HIF-1α protein levels, augmented HIF-1 DNA binding activity, and stimulation of HIF-1-mediated reporter gene transcription. In normoxic conditions, HIF-1α is maintained at low levels by a degradation process involving the ubiquitin-proteasome system (42Salceda S. Caro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22642-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar, 43Huang L.E., Gu, J. Schau M. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7987-7992Crossref PubMed Scopus (1855) Google Scholar). Hypoxia rapidly increases the amount of HIF-1α by inhibiting its proteasome-dependent degradation. Surprisingly, insulin does not seem to act on HIF-1α degradation. A comparison of the half-life of HIF-1α after the removal of insulin or in presence of both insulin and cycloheximide, a translation inhibitor, shows that insulin does not stabilize the HIF-1α protein. Furthermore, insulin does not affect the transcription of HIF-1α mRNA, suggesting that it regulates HIF-1α translation. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the possibility that insulin regulates the translation of a protein, which inhibits HIF-1α degradation. It is of interest to note that a recent study shows that heregulin, which activates the tyrosine kinase receptor HER2, stimulates HIF-1α synthesis (30Laughner E. Taghavi P. Chiles K. Mahon P.C. Semenza G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3995-4004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1133) Google Scholar), similar to our results concerning insulin action. In ARPE-19 cells, we found that the insulin effect on HIF-1α expression, HIF-1 activation, and VEGF expression are dependent on the PI3K·PKB·TOR pathway. In contrast, the MEK pathway does not appear to be required for insulin action on HIF-1. Both the MAPK and PI3K pathways have been implicated in HIF-1 regulation. The p42 and p44 MAPKs activate HIF-1 by promoting the phosphorylation of HIF-1α in response to hypoxia and its accumulation in response to advanced glycation end products or mersalyl (1Treins C.

PI3K-dependent pathways have been implicated in HIF-1 and VEGF expression in transformed cells (47Jiang B.H. Zheng J.Z. Aoki M. Vogt P.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Hunter T. Vogt P.K. Cell Growth Differ. 2001; 12: 363-369PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the activation of PKB or inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene encoding phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10, which dephosphorylates the PI3K reaction products phosphatidylinositol 3,4-biphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate, increases HIF-1α protein levels and HIF-1-dependent reporter gene expression (30Laughner E.

Giaccia A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 391-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TOR seems to be involved only partly in the insulin action on HIF-1 activity, because the inhibition of TOR does not completely abolish HIF-1α expression and HIF-1 activation. These results suggest that at least the two following pathways are involved in insulin-induced HIF-1 regulation, a PKB-dependent/TOR-independent pathway and a PKB/TOR-dependent pathway. The PKB-dependent/TOR-independent pathway remains unknown, because a direct phosphorylation of HIF-1α by PKB has been excluded (51Zundel W. Schindler C. Haas-Kogan D. Koong A. Kaper F. Chen E. Gottschalk A.R. Ryan H.E. Johnson R.S. Jefferson A.B. Stokoe D. Giaccia A.J. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 391-396Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, PKB could be involved in the insulin regulation of HIF-1α translation. It has been previously shown that insulin stimulates protein synthesis by the activation of eIF2B (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2B), an essential translation initiation factor, through a PI3K/PKB/glycogen synthase kinase-3 pathway (52Welsh G.I. Stokes C.M. Wang X. Sakaue H. Ogawa W. Kasuga M. Proud C.G. FEBS Lett. 1997; 410: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 53Welsh G.I. Miller C.M. Loughlin A.J. Price N.T. Proud C.G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). For the PKB/TOR-dependent pathway, it has been shown that TOR activity positively regulates translation. Insulin induces the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 through a PI3K·PKB·TOR pathway (54Takata M. Ogawa W. Kitamura T. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Kotani K. Klip A. Gingras A.C. Sonenberg N. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20611-20618Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 results in a decrease in its binding affinity for eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E, an essential translation initiation factor. The subsequent dissociation of eIF-4E (eukaryotic translation initiation factor) from 4E-BP1 promotes cap structure-dependent translation initiation (55Sonenberg N. Gingras A.C. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 268-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (510) Google Scholar, 56Lawrence J.C. Fadden P. Haystead T.A. Lin T.A. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1997; 37: 239-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We could hypothesize that insulin-activated TOR by phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 dissociates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E from 4E-BP1 and stimulates the translation initiation of the HIF-1α mRNA. In diabetes, several factors could be involved in the worsening of the diabetic retinopathy including (i) advanced glycation end products generated during hyperglycemia, (ii) hypoxia resulting from microvascular retinal occlusion, and (iii) hyperinsulinemia stimulating VEGF expression through the up-regulation of HIF-1 expression (1Treins C. Giorgetti-Peraldi S. Murdaca J. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43836-43841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 57Pe'er J. Folberg R. Itin A. Gnessin H. Hemo I. Keshet E. Ophthalmology. 1998; 105: 412-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Moreover, the co-treatment of retinal epithelial cells with both insulin and advanced glycation end products increases VEGF expression (1Treins C. Giorgetti-Peraldi S. Murdaca J. Van Obberghen E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43836-43841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). The advanced glycation end products and insulin activate HIF-1 through distinct pathways, because advanced glycation end-induced HIF-1 activation is dependent on MAPK, whereas insulin-induced HIF-1 activation is dependent on PI3K. Hypoxia blocks HIF-1α degradation, whereas growth factors acting through tyrosine kinase receptors would increase its synthesis. The combination of these different signals enhances the activation of the transcription factor leading to increased VEGF gene expression. The result would be an amplification of the angiogenic signal leading to further progression of diabetic retinopathy. In conclusion, we have shown that insulin activates the transcription factor HIF-1 through a PI3K·PKB·TOR-dependent pathway. Ours results suggest that insulin similar to heregulin regulates HIF-1α synthesis. It remains to established whether such an effect on HIF-1α synthesis is a general feature of receptor tyrosine kinases. We thank P. Peraldi for critical reading of this paper. We also thank J. Plouet (Toulouse, France) for VEGF165 cDNA and B. Hemmings, S. Tartare-Deckert, and M. Montminy for the gift of antibodies."

A null mutation was introduced into the Matriptase/MT-SP1 gene of mice to determine the role of Matriptase/MT-SP1 in epidermal development and neoplasia. Matriptase/MT-SP1-deficient mice developed to term but uniformly died within 48 h of birth. All epidermal surfaces of newborn mice were grossly abnormal with a dry, red, shiny, and wrinkled appearance. Matriptase/MT-SP1-deficiency caused striking malformations of the stratum corneum, characterized by dysmorphic and pleomorphic corneocytes and the absence of vesicular bodies in transitional layer cells. This aberrant skin development seriously compromised both inward and outward epidermal barrier function, leading to the rapid and fatal dehydration of Matriptase/MT-SP1-deficient pups. Loss of Matriptase/MT-SP1 also seriously affected hair follicle development resulting in generalized follicular hypoplasia, absence of erupted vibrissae, lack of vibrissal hair canal formation, ingrown vibrissae, and wholesale abortion of vibrissal follicles. Furthermore, Matriptase/MT-SP1-deficiency resulted in dramatically increased thymocyte apoptosis, and depletion of thymocytes. This study demonstrates that Matriptase/MT-SP1 has pleiotropic functions in the development of the epidermis, hair follicles, and cellular immune system."

Here, we report for the first time that apigenin inhibits the growth of androgen-responsive human prostate carcinoma LNCaP cells and provide molecular understanding of this effect. The cell growth inhibition achieved by apigenin treatment resulted in a significant decrease in AR protein expression along with a decrease in intracellular and secreted forms of PSA. These effects were also observed in DHT-stimulated cells. Further, apigenin treatment of LNCaP cells resulted in G1 arrest in cell cycle progression which was associated with a marked decrease in the protein expression of cyclin D1, D2 and E and their activating partner cdk2, 4 and 6 with concomitant induction of WAF1/p21 and KIP1/p27. The induction of WAF1/p21 appears to be transcriptionally upregulated and is p53 dependent. In addition, apigenin inhibited the hyperphosphorylation of the pRb protein in these cells. Apigenin treatment also resulted in induction of apoptosis as determined by DNA fragmentation, PARP cleavage, fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. These effects were found to correlate with a shift in Bax/Bcl-2 ratio more towards apoptosis. Apigenin treatment also resulted in down-modulation of the constitutive expression of NF-kappaB/p65. Taken together, these findings suggest that apigenin has strong potential for development as an agent for prevention against prostate cancer."

To better understand the consequences of such lipid loading, murine peritoneal macrophages were isolated and incubated with ligands for two nuclear receptors, liver X receptor (LXR) and retinoic acid receptor (RXR). Analysis of the expressed mRNAs using microarray technology led to the identification of four highly induced genes that encode apolipoproteins E, C-I, C-IV, and C-II. Northern blot analysis confirmed that the mRNA levels of these four genes were induced 2–14-fold in response to natural or synthetic ligands for LXR and/or RXR. The induction of all four mRNAs was greatly attenuated in peritoneal macrophages derived from LXRα/β null mice. The two LXR response elements located within the multienhancers ME.1 and ME.2 were shown to be essential for the induction of apoC-II promoter-reporter genes by ligands for LXR and/or RXR. Finally, immunohistochemical studies demonstrate that apoC-II protein co-localizes with macrophages within murine arterial lesions.

These four secreted proteins have important roles in lipoprotein/lipid homeostasis. ApoE is a component of chylomicrons, VLDL, and intermediate density lipoprotein (3Curtiss L.K. Boisvert W.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), where it functions to mediate the clearance of these lipoproteins from the circulation by a process that is dependent on the interaction of apoE with specific cell surface receptors (3Curtiss L.K. Boisvert W.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The majority of plasma apoE is derived from the liver (4Reue K.L. Quon D.H. O'Donnell K.A.

However, other tissues, including brain glial cells and macrophages, synthesize and secrete apoE (5Basu S.K., Ho, Y.K. Brown M.S. Bilheimer D.W. Anderson R.G. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 806-813Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that macrophage-derived apoE is important in preventing and/or reducing cholesteryl ester accumulation in macrophages in the artery wall. It has been proposed that this anti-atherosclerotic effect of apoE is a result of the apoE-dependent efflux of cholesterol from foam cells (11Lin C.Y. Duan H. Mazzone T. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1618-1627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the relative importance of this apoE-dependent cholesterol efflux, as compared with the ABCA1/apoAI-dependent lipid efflux (reviewed in Ref.12Oram J.F. Vaughan A.M. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 253-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) is currently unknown. Nonetheless, several studies suggest that the anti-atherosclerotic effect of macrophage-derived apoE is independent of its role in increasing the clearance of lipoproteins from the plasma (reviewed in Ref. 3Curtiss L.K. Boisvert W.A. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). ApoC-II mRNA has been identified in murine liver, intestine, and macrophages (13Hoffer M.J. van Eck M.M. Havekes L.M. Hofker M.H. Frants R.R. Genomics. 1993; 17: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). ApoC-II is the obligate cofactor for lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and is required for the LPL-dependent hydrolysis of triglycerides present in chylomicrons, VLDL, and high density lipoprotein (14Fojo S.S. Brewer H.B. J. Intern. Med. 1992; 231: 669-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Deficiency of either apoC-II or LPL results in hypertriglyceridemia (15Brunzell J.D. Scriver C.R. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 2. McGraw-Hill, Inc., New York1995: 1913-1932Google Scholar). Paradoxically, transgenic mice expressing human apoC-II are also hypertriglyceridemic, suggesting that apoC-II may have other unknown functions in addition to acting as the obligate co-factor of LPL (16Shachter N.S. Hayek T. Leff T. Smith J.D. Rosenberg D.W. Walsh A. Ramakrishnan R. Goldberg I.J. Ginsberg H.N. Breslow J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1683-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). ApoC-I, like apoC-II, is expressed in the liver and is associated with triglyceride-rich chylomicrons and VLDL (17Jong M.C. Gijbels M.J. Dahlmans V.E. Gorp P.J. Koopman S.J. Ponec M. Hofker M.H. Havekes L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 145-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). ApoC-I has been reported to inhibit cholesteryl ester transfer protein, to activate the enzyme lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase, and to inhibit lipoprotein binding to the LDL receptor-related protein (Ref. 18Shachter N.S. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2001; 12: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar and references therein). The physiological role of apoC-IV remains to be established. Compared with other members of this apolipoprotein gene cluster, apoC-IV hepatic mRNA and plasma protein levels are expressed at extremely low levels (1Allan C.M. Walker D. Segrest J.P. Taylor J.M. Genomics. 1995; 28: 291-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 19van Eck M.M. Hoffer M.J. Havekes L.M. Frants R.R. Hofker M.H. Genomics. 1994; 21: 110-115Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). However, expression of the human apoC-IV transgene in mice led to hypertriglyceridemia, as a result of the accumulation of human apoC-IV-enriched VLDL (20Allan C.M. Taylor J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1510-1518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This latter result suggests that apoC-IV may function to inhibit the hydrolysis of triglycerides contained within VLDL particles. Despite their apparently diverse functions, the expression of some or all members of this apolipoprotein gene cluster is reported to be coordinately regulated by distal enhancer regions; Taylor and co-workers (21Simonet W.S.

In addition, two multienhancer regions (ME.1 and ME.2, each 620 bp) control the expression of apoE in macrophage, adipose tissue (24Shih S.J. Allan C. Grehan S. Tse E. Moran C. Taylor J.M. J. Biol.

Functional response elements for the nuclear receptors FXR and LXR have been identified in HCRs (27Kast H.R. Nguyen C.M. Sinal C.J. Jones S.A. Laffitte B.A. Reue K. Gonzalez F.J. Willson T.M.

These results are consistent with the emerging theme that LXR and FXR play key roles in regulating genes involved in lipoprotein metabolism. The FXR response elements in HCR.1 and HCR.2 were shown to be bound by the FXR/RXR heterodimer and to be required for bile acid-dependent activation of the apoC-II gene (27Kast H.R. Nguyen C.M.

In addition, the LXREs located in ME.1 and ME.2 were shown to be required for the induction of apoE in human macrophages, in response to ligands for LXR (28Laffitte B.A. Repa J.J. Joseph S.B.

There are two LXR genes, LXRα and LXRβ, that encode two forms of LXR and that share about 78% identity at the amino acid level in both the DNA- and ligand-binding domains (29Alberti S. Steffensen K.R. Gustafsson J.A. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 243: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Each LXR isoform complexes with RXRα to form a functional heterodimer that binds to the aforementioned LXREs (reviewed in Ref. 30Edwards P.A. Kast H.R. Anisfeld A.M. J.

In the current study, we utilized mouse peritoneal macrophages treated with ligands for LXR and RXR and employed microarray technology to identify novel LXR target genes. These studies led to the identification of apoC-I, apoC-IV, apoC-II, and apoE, as target genes of LXR. All four genes were highly induced in both human and mouse primary macrophages following LXR activation. Induction was attenuated or abolished in macrophages derived from LXR α/β−/−mice. Studies with reporter genes suggest that the LXRE in the distal enhancer, ME.2, has a critical role in regulating the expression of this gene cluster. Consistent with these observations, immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that apoC-II protein co-localizes with macrophages in murine atherosclerotic lesions. Our studies support the hypothesis that induction of the apoE/C-I/C-IV/C-II gene cluster in macrophages by LXR/RXR may be a critical event in the subsequent efflux of lipids to apolipoproteins in the artery wall. Mouse apoC-II antibody was a kind gift from Dr. Karl Weisgraber (Gladstone Institute, UCSF). pCMX expression plasmids for LXRα and RXRα were a gift from Ron Evans (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA).

Human monocytes were isolated from peripheral blood by elutriation and plated on 100-mm dishes at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium in the presence of 30% autologous serum, 0.22% insulin, antibiotics, and fungizone (40Fogelman A.M.

On day 8, the medium was replaced with Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium supplemented with either 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 10% LPDS, or 10% LPDS and mevalonic acid (100 μm) in the presence of either 5 μm compactin (unloaded) or ligands for LXR (1 μm T or 5 μm22(R)-hydroxycholesterol) and RXR (100 nm LG). HepG2 cells were maintained in modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS as described (27Kast H.R. Nguyen C.M. Sinal C.J. Jones S.A. Laffitte B.A. Reue K. Gonzalez F.J. Willson T.M. Edwards P.A.

Eight-week-old female C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME), and injected intraperitoneally with 1 ml of 4% thioglycollate solution (Difco) 4 days prior to harvesting macrophages. Briefly, the mice were sacrificed, and ice-cold high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and 20 ml penicillin/streptomycin was injected into the peritoneal cavity of each mouse. This fluid was carefully withdrawn and centrifuged, and the cell pellet was resuspended in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. The cells were pooled and plated at 1.2 million cells/ml, and the macrophages were allowed to adhere for 2–6 h. The medium was then replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% LPDS, 100 μm mevalonic acid, and either 5 μmcompactin, T, and/or 0.1 μm LG, and the cells were incubated for 8–36 h, as indicated in the text and legends. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen) and further purified by using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The GeneChip murine genome MG-U74Av2 microarrays were purchased from Affymetrix Inc. (Santa Clarita, CA). RNA was isolated from duplicate dishes of murine peritoneal macrophages incubated in 10% LPDS and 100 μm mevalonic acid and either 5 μm compactin or 5 μm T and 100 nm LG. Four complementary RNA samples were prepared, and each was hybridized to an individual microarray. Preliminary data analysis was performed by the Microarray Core Facility at University of California at Irvine. Further analysis and data mining were performed using Affymetrix microarray suite 4.0, and GeneSpring 4.0 (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA). These analyses provide a signal for each specific gene/EST that is subsequently normalized by comparing to the median signal (arbitrary value of 1.0) obtained from the whole array. Genes/ESTs were considered to be potential LXR/RXR target genes when the signal derived from RNA isolated from cells treated with ligands for LXR and RXR was (i) greater than the median signal on the array and (ii) at least 2-fold greater than the signal derived from RNA isolated from unloaded cells. Seventy genes/ESTs satisfied these criteria. Total RNA (2–10 μg/lane) was separated by 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nylon membrane, and the latter was hybridized with [α-32P]dCTP-radiolabeled DNA probes as described previously (27Kast H.R.

ME.1 was also cloned into the SmaI-XmaI sites upstream of ME.2-CII-luc to give ME.1-ME.2-CII-luc. The LXRE in ME.2 was mutated by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to manufacturer's instructions using primers 5′-ccaccagctgccaggAAcactggcgAAcaaaggcag-3′ and 5′-ctgcctttgTTcgccagtgTTcctggcagctggtgg-3′. Transient transfections of HepG2 cells were performed in triplicate in a 48-well plate using an MBS mammalian transfection kit (Stratagene) with minor modifications. The cells were transfected with 100 ng of a reporter construct, pCMV-β-galactosidase (50 ng), and either the receptor plasmids pCMX-LXRα (50 ng) and pCMX-RXRα (5 ng) or the control pTKCIII (55 ng), using a total of 205 ng of DNA/well. After transfection, the cells were incubated for 24 h in modified Eagle's medium containing 10% LPDS supplemented with 100 mm mevalonic acid in the presence of either 5 μm compactin or ligands for LXRα (1 μm T) or RXRα (100 nm LG), before lysis.

Heart tissue cryosections were obtained from an LDL receptor-deficient mouse that had consumed a high fat diet (TD 94059, Harlan Teklab; 15.8% fat and 1.25% cholesterol) for 16 weeks. The cryosections were fixed in acetone at −20 °C for 2 min and immersed in PBS for 2 min to rehydrate the tissues. All further incubations were performed at room temperature in a humid chamber. The sections were incubated for 30 min in 10% goat serum diluted in PBS. After blot drying, the sections were incubated with rabbit anti-mouse apoC-II (1:2000 dilution of antiserum) or biotinylated F4/80 antibodies (Caltag, Burlingame, CA; at 20 μg/ml) in PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.15% Triton X-100. After thorough washing, endogenous peroxidase was blocked for 2 min with a blocking agent (Zymed Laboratories Inc., South San Francisco, CA). For apoC-II staining, the slides were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG (10 μg/ml in PBS/bovine serum albumin/Triton X-100) for 1 h. All of the sections were then exposed to Vectastain ABC Elite solution (Vector Laboratories) for 30 min and developed with 9-amino-3-ethylene carbazole (Vector Laboratories). The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin, mounted with an aqueous mounting medium (Shandon, Lipshaw, PA), and photographed. To identify novel genes that are activated by the LXR/RXR heterodimer, peritoneal macrophages were isolated from 8-week-old female C57BL/6 mice 4 days after thioglycollate injection. The cells were cultured overnight in medium containing 10% FBS and subsequently cultured for 36 h in a cholesterol-poor medium (10% LPDS) supplemented with 100 μm mevalonic acid and either compactin and vehicle (Me2SO) or the ligands for LXR (T) and RXR (LG). RNA was isolated and subsequently processed for hybridization to Affymetrix microarrays (MG-U74Av2), which contain probes representing over 12,000 murine genes and ESTs sequences. Analysis of the data using Affymetrix standard protocols and GeneSpring software (see “Experimental Procedures”) indicated that 70 genes/EST sequences met the following criteria: (i) the signal derived from cells treated with ligands for LXR and RXR was greater than the median signal on the array and (ii) the ratio of the signal from induced:control cells was ≥2-fold. Using these criteria, the identified genes include sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1, fatty acid synthase, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), ABCA1 and ABCG1 (two members of the ATP-binding cassette family of transporter proteins), and apoE (Table I). These six genes served as positive controls, because they have all been previously identified as LXR target genes (28Laffitte B.A. Repa J.J. Joseph S.B. Wilpitz D.C. Kast H.R. Mangelsdorf D.J.

Analysis of the data indicated that apoC-II also met these criteria, suggesting that it might represent a gene that was induced by ligands for LXR and RXR (Table I). Northern blot analyses demonstrated that apoC-II and apoE mRNA levels were induced 10.55 ± 4.4 and 7.19 ± 3.9-fold (mean ± S.D., n = 4;p < 0.05 compared with unloaded cells), respectively, when cells were treated with LXR and RXR ligands.

Interestingly, analysis of the Affymetrix data indicated that the mRNAs for apoC-I and apoC-IV were expressed at low levels in unloaded cells but appeared to be induced in cells treated with ligands for LXR and RXR (Table I).

CaM co-immunoprecipitates with KCNQ2, KCNQ3, or KCNQ5 subunits better in the absence than in the presence of Ca2+. Moreover, in two-hybrid assays where it is possible to detect interactions with apo-CaM but not with Ca2+-bound calmodulin, we localized the CaM-binding site to a region that is predicted to contain two α-helices (A and B). These two helices encompass ∼85 amino acids, and in KCNQ2 they are separated by a dispensable stretch of ∼130 amino acids. Within this CaM-binding domain, we found an IQ-like CaM-binding motif in helix A and two overlapping consensus 1–5-10 CaM-binding motifs in helix B. Point mutations in helix A or B were capable of abolishing CaM binding in the two-hybrid assay. Moreover, glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins containing helices A and B were capable of binding to CaM, indicating that the interaction with KCNQ channels is direct. Full-length CaM (both N and C lobes) and a functional EF-1 hand were required for these interactions to occur. These observations suggest that apo-CaM is bound to neuronal KCNQ channels at low resting Ca2+ levels and that this interaction is disturbed when the [Ca2+] is raised.

Remarkably, mutations in four of the five known members of this family have been associated with different hereditary human disorders. While mutations in the KCNQ1 subunit (KvQT1) lead to arrhythmia in the human long QT syndrome, mutations in KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 are associated with a benign form of epilepsy. It has also been shown that KCNQ4 is mutated in a dominant form of progressive hearing loss (1Jentsch T.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar).With regards to the normal physiology of this protein family, the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 subunits have been shown to form M-type potassium channels whose expression is restricted to neuronal tissue (2Wang H.S. Pan Z. Shi W. Brown B.S. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). Moreover, in some brain areas and neuronal tissues, KCNQ4 and KCNQ5 also contribute to the formation of M channels, suggesting that the different combinations of KCNQ subunits may be in part responsible for the diversity of M channel properties (1Jentsch T.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). The M current (I M) is a subthreshold noninactivating voltage-dependent potassium current that is found in many neuronal cell types. The M current controls membrane excitability, and it has been shown to be modulated by a variety of intracellular signals that in turn dramatically affect the firing rate of neurons. Among those intracellular signals, Ca2+ has been shown to mediate the inhibition of I M by B2bradykinin receptors in sympathetic neurons (3Cruzblanca H. Koh D.S. Hille B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7151-7156Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Indeed, intracellular Ca2+ can suppress the activity of M channels under conditions that do not support enzymatic activities such as phosphorylation (4Selyanko A.A. Brown D.A. Neuron. 1996; 16: 151-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This phenomenon suggests that an intermediary might be involved in this Ca2+-dependent modulation.In a search for candidates that might mediate the effects of Ca2+ in modulating I M, we screened a human brain cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system. We found that calmodulin (CaM)1bound to the C-terminal region of KCNQ channels. CaM is a small Ca2+-binding protein that acts as a ubiquitous intracellular Ca2+ sensor in the regulation of a growing diverse array of ion channels (5Saimi Y. Kung C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 289-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Efforts to define common characteristics of CaM binding have indicated that it associates with short α-helical sequences within its targets (6O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 7Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 8Jurado L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Jarrett H.W. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 661-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). However, it appears that the interaction of CaM with KCNQ channels does not conform to this simple model. Rather, our data suggest that the CaM-binding site in KCNQ channels is formed by two α-helices that are separated by a stretch of ∼130 amino acids. We hypothesize that those two helices come into close proximity in the tertiary structure, facilitating CaM binding.DISCUSSIONWe have demonstrated here that CaM binds to the intracellular C-terminal domain of neuronal KCNQ2, KCNQ3, and KCNQ5 transmembrane channels. Two-hybrid experiments suggest that CaM also binds to KCNQ1 and KCNQ4, but more experiments are necessary to unequivocally confirm this interaction. The voltage-dependent channels to which members of this family of proteins contribute have been implicated in a variety of physiological processes and pathologies. As a result, the modulation of the activity of these channels through intracellular signaling is important in maintaining the physiological homeostasis of nervous tissue (30Marrion N.V. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 483-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). An example of this can be seen in the Ca2+-dependent regulation of M channels (made up of KCNQ subunits) that influences the firing rate of the sympathetic cells in which they are expressed. Our results indicate that through its association with these proteins, CaM may mediate the Ca2+-dependent modulation of channels that include KCNQ subunits.In addition to demonstrating here that CaM associates with members of the KCNQ family, we have also defined its binding site. The binding site identified in this study is unusual in that it is composed of two discontinuous regions, helix A and helix B. Helix A contains an IQ-like binding motif, a motif (IQXXXRXXXXR) that mediates apo-CaM binding in a variety of proteins (31Bahler M. Rhoads A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and that contains positively charged residues at positions 6 and 11. When compared with other IQ motifs, in the helix A of the KCNQ channels the second Arg is replaced by a negatively charged or neutral amino acid. As a result, this domain resembles the second “incomplete” IQ motif on myosin II, the region to which the regulatory myosin light chain (structurally similar to CaM) binds. A model of apo-CaM binding derived from this and other light chain structures bound to myosin IQ motifs reveals that the initial portion of this motif (IQXXXR) is the most critical part. Moreover, it is this region that is specifically recognized by the loop between EF hands 3 and 4 and that determines a semi-open lobe conformation (32Houdusse A. Silver M. Cohen C. Structure. 1996; 4: 1475-1490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In accordance with this model, the interaction of KCNQ2 with CaM is destabilized when point mutations are introduced in this first part of the IQ motif.On many occasions, the C lobe of CaM has been shown to be that which interacts with peptides, as also occurs with CaM-like proteins that associate with peptides. Moreover, the bound peptide essentially occupies the same position relative to the C-terminal EF hand domain (33Atkinson R.A. Joseph C. Kelly G. Muskett F.W. Frenkiel T.A. Nietlispach D. Pastore A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The finding that the C lobe is sufficient to bind to SK channels (21Keen J.E. Khawaled R. Farrens D.L. Neelands T. Rivard A. Bond C.T. Janowsky A. Fakler B. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8830-8838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), P/Q Ca2+ channels, and neurogranin supports this finding. However, in contrast, it appears that to bind to KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 channels, both the C and N lobes are required.Surprisingly, we found that when using the full-length C-terminal region of SK2 as bait, point mutations that abolish Ca2+binding to EF hands 3 or 4 also abrogate the interaction with CaM. There is, however, ample biochemical, functional, and structural evidence to indicate that Ca2+ is not bound to EF hands 3 or 4 when CaM interacts with SK2. In addition, it has been shown that the Ca2+-free C-terminal lobe is that which mediates the binding of CaM to the SK2 CaM-binding domain (21Keen J.E. Khawaled R. Farrens D.L. Neelands T. Rivard A.

Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that mutating the first aspartate to alanine in the EF hands that directly mediate the interaction of apo-CaM with the target causes a reduction in the binding strength. By analogy with the SK2 CaM-binding domain, the observation that the interaction of CaM with KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 does not tolerate point mutations at EF hand 1 and (to a lesser degree) 3 suggests that binding to the KCNQ-BD is mainly mediated by the apo-EF hands 1 and 3. Interestingly, EF hand 1 is most similar to EF hand 3 (8Jurado L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Jarrett H.W. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 661-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), suggesting that both play a similar role in stabilizing the target complex.The difficulties in identifying apo-CaM interactions have been highlighted by Erickson et al. (27Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2001; 31: 973-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). To overcome this problem, a very elegant technique has been developed, three-cube fluorescence resonance energy transfer, that demonstrates the preassociation of CaM with calcium channels in living cells (27Erickson M.G.

The yeast two-hybrid system is another viable alternative for approaching this problem. Our results provide further evidence that the two-hybrid assay is capable of detecting interactions between the Ca2+-free form of CaM and target proteins such as the SK2 K+ channels (21Keen J.E. Khawaled R. Farrens D.L. Neelands T. Rivard A. Bond C.T. Janowsky A. Fakler B. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8830-8838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It should be born in mind that a limitation of the two-hybrid system is that the transmembrane segments of target proteins must be eliminated to allow targeting of the bait to the nucleus (34Niethammer M. Sheng M. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 104-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, the main advantage is that this is a relatively simple assay and that it does offer us the opportunity to study protein-protein interactions in a living cell (16Prichard L. Deloulme J.C. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7689-7694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar).The recent resolution of the structure of CaM associated with the SK-binding domain has shown that the binding domain is composed of two α-helices connected by a short loop (23Schumacher M.A. Rivard A.F. Bachinger H.P. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The high probability that the two KCNQ regions contain α-helices suggests that a similar conformation to the SK2 CaM-binding domain may also arise in KCNQ. However, some differences are evident. Although in SK channels the connecting loop is only 5 aa long, in KCNQ channels this varies from ∼100 to ∼150 aa. Secondly, the C lobe of CaM (EF hands 3 and 4) is sufficient for binding to SK channels (21Keen J.E. Khawaled R. Farrens D.L. Neelands T. Rivard A. Bond C.T. Janowsky A. Fakler B. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8830-8838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the complete CaM molecule is necessary for binding to KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 channels. In essence, our data suggests that the C-terminal domain of KCNQ channels folds in such a way that helix A and helix B form a compact structure that can be engulfed between the N- and C-terminal lobes of apo-CaM (Fig. 8).What is the role of CaM in KCNQ function? The preassociation of apo-CaM to a target protein whose activity may be regulated by CaM generally ensures a rapid and selective response to local elevations in Ca2+ (8Jurado L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Jarrett H.W. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 661-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 27Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2001; 31: 973-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Indeed, the suppression of the M current by bradykinin in rat sympathetic neurons is mediated by this cation (3Cruzblanca H. Koh D.S. Hille B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7151-7156Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and apo-CaM has been shown to modulate the Ca2+-dependent gating of many channels (27Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2001; 31: 973-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar,35Levitan I.B. Neuron. 1999; 22: 645-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-dependent modulation of M channels can also be observed in excised patches. Under these conditions, signaling pathways such as phosphorylation are not supported, and because the effects observed are fully reversible, it becomes very unlikely that the modulation of I Mvia Ca2+ is due to dephosphorylation of the M channel or of an associated protein. Furthermore, the absence of a “signature” flickering behavior and the tendency to “desensitize” in inside-out patches (i.e. the effect is transient) suggests that the activity of Ca2+ does not involve the direct blockage of the internal mouth of the channel (4Selyanko A.A. Brown D.A. Neuron. 1996; 16: 151-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the mediator exists in limited amounts in excised patches and that it is washed out after the application of Ca2+. These properties suggest the involvement of a Ca2+ sensor such as CaM, which, as we have shown, interacts with the C-terminal intracellular region of KCNQ channels. In this respect, it is interesting to reflect on the fact that helix A is adjacent to the end of S6, the last transmembrane domain (Fig. 8). In other channels with a similar six transmembrane architecture, such as SK Ca2+-activated K+ channels and cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, gating is modulated by a module that attaches to the end of S6 (23Schumacher M.A. Rivard A.F. Bachinger H.P. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 36Johnson J.P.J. Zagotta W.N. Nature. 2001; 412: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, we should also bear in mind that the binding of CaM may also be important in other processes such as assembly or trafficking (37Gao T. Bunemann M. Gerhardstein B.L. Ma H. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25436-25444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 38Joiner W.J. Khanna R. Schlichter L.C. Kaczmarek L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 31: 699-711Google Scholar). The functional analysis of mutants unable to bind CaM should help to unveil the role of CaM in KCNQ channel function. The KCNQ transmembrane proteins are members of a family of voltage-dependent potassium selective channels that are involved in the control of cellular excitability. Remarkably, mutations in four of the five known members of this family have been associated with different hereditary human disorders. While mutations in the KCNQ1 subunit (KvQT1) lead to arrhythmia in the human long QT syndrome, mutations in KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 are associated with a benign form of epilepsy. It has also been shown that KCNQ4 is mutated in a dominant form of progressive hearing loss (1Jentsch T.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). With regards to the normal physiology of this protein family, the KCNQ2 and KCNQ3 subunits have been shown to form M-type potassium channels whose expression is restricted to neuronal tissue (2Wang H.S. Pan Z. Shi W. Brown B.S. Wymore R.S. Cohen I.S. Dixon J.E. McKinnon D. Science. 1998; 282: 1890-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). Moreover, in some brain areas and neuronal tissues, KCNQ4 and KCNQ5 also contribute to the formation of M channels, suggesting that the different combinations of KCNQ subunits may be in part responsible for the diversity of M channel properties (1Jentsch T.J. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2000; 1: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). The M current (I M) is a subthreshold noninactivating voltage-dependent potassium current that is found in many neuronal cell types. The M current controls membrane excitability, and it has been shown to be modulated by a variety of intracellular signals that in turn dramatically affect the firing rate of neurons. Among those intracellular signals, Ca2+ has been shown to mediate the inhibition of I M by B2bradykinin receptors in sympathetic neurons (3Cruzblanca H. Koh D.S. Hille B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7151-7156Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Indeed, intracellular Ca2+ can suppress the activity of M channels under conditions that do not support enzymatic activities such as phosphorylation (4Selyanko A.A. Brown D.A. Neuron. 1996; 16: 151-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). This phenomenon suggests that an intermediary might be involved in this Ca2+-dependent modulation. In a search for candidates that might mediate the effects of Ca2+ in modulating I M, we screened a human brain cDNA library using the yeast two-hybrid system. We found that calmodulin (CaM)1bound to the C-terminal region of KCNQ channels. CaM is a small Ca2+-binding protein that acts as a ubiquitous intracellular Ca2+ sensor in the regulation of a growing diverse array of ion channels (5Saimi Y. Kung C. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 289-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Efforts to define common characteristics of CaM binding have indicated that it associates with short α-helical sequences within its targets (6O'Neil K.T. DeGrado W.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 59-64Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar, 7Rhoads A.R. Friedberg F. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar, 8Jurado L.A.

The binding site identified in this study is unusual in that it is composed of two discontinuous regions, helix A and helix B. Helix A contains an IQ-like binding motif, a motif (IQXXXRXXXXR) that mediates apo-CaM binding in a variety of proteins (31Bahler M. Rhoads A. FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar) and that contains positively charged residues at positions 6 and 11. When compared with other IQ motifs, in the helix A of the KCNQ channels the second Arg is replaced by a negatively charged or neutral amino acid. As a result, this domain resembles the second “incomplete” IQ motif on myosin II, the region to which the regulatory myosin light chain (structurally similar to CaM) binds. A model of apo-CaM binding derived from this and other light chain structures bound to myosin IQ motifs reveals that the initial portion of this motif (IQXXXR) is the most critical part. Moreover, it is this region that is specifically recognized by the loop between EF hands 3 and 4 and that determines a semi-open lobe conformation (32Houdusse A. Silver M. Cohen C. Structure. 1996; 4: 1475-1490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In accordance with this model, the interaction of KCNQ2 with CaM is destabilized when point mutations are introduced in this first part of the IQ motif. On many occasions, the C lobe of CaM has been shown to be that which interacts with peptides, as also occurs with CaM-like proteins that associate with peptides. Moreover, the bound peptide essentially occupies the same position relative to the C-terminal EF hand domain (33Atkinson R.A. Joseph C. Kelly G. Muskett F.W. Frenkiel T.A. Nietlispach D. Pastore A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The finding that the C lobe is sufficient to bind to SK channels (21Keen J.E. Khawaled R. Farrens D.L. Neelands T. Rivard A. Bond C.T. Janowsky A. Fakler B. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8830-8838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), P/Q Ca2+ channels, and neurogranin supports this finding. However, in contrast, it appears that to bind to KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 channels, both the C and N lobes are required. Surprisingly, we found that when using the full-length C-terminal region of SK2 as bait, point mutations that abolish Ca2+binding to EF hands 3 or 4 also abrogate the interaction with CaM. There is, however, ample biochemical, functional, and structural evidence to indicate that Ca2+ is not bound to EF hands 3 or 4 when CaM interacts with SK2. In addition, it has been shown that the Ca2+-free C-terminal lobe is that which mediates the binding of CaM to the SK2 CaM-binding domain (21Keen J.E. Khawaled R. Farrens D.L. Neelands T. Rivard A. Bond C.T. Janowsky A. Fakler B. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8830-8838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Schumacher M.A. Rivard A.F. Bachinger H.P. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that mutating the first aspartate to alanine in the EF hands that directly mediate the interaction of apo-CaM with the target causes a reduction in the binding strength. By analogy with the SK2 CaM-binding domain, the observation that the interaction of CaM with KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 does not tolerate point mutations at EF hand 1 and (to a lesser degree) 3 suggests that binding to the KCNQ-BD is mainly mediated by the apo-EF hands 1 and 3. Interestingly, EF hand 1 is most similar to EF hand 3 (8Jurado L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Jarrett H.W. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 661-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), suggesting that both play a similar role in stabilizing the target complex. The difficulties in identifying apo-CaM interactions have been highlighted by Erickson et al. (27Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2001; 31: 973-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). To overcome this problem, a very elegant technique has been developed, three-cube fluorescence resonance energy transfer, that demonstrates the preassociation of CaM with calcium channels in living cells (27Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2001; 31: 973-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). The yeast two-hybrid system is another viable alternative for approaching this problem. Our results provide further evidence that the two-hybrid assay is capable of detecting interactions between the Ca2+-free form of CaM and target proteins such as the SK2 K+ channels (21Keen J.E. Khawaled R. Farrens D.L. Neelands T. Rivard A. Bond C.T. Janowsky A. Fakler B. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8830-8838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It should be born in mind that a limitation of the two-hybrid system is that the transmembrane segments of target proteins must be eliminated to allow targeting of the bait to the nucleus (34Niethammer M. Sheng M. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 104-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, the main advantage is that this is a relatively simple assay and that it does offer us the opportunity to study protein-protein interactions in a living cell (16Prichard L. Deloulme J.C. Storm D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7689-7694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The recent resolution of the structure of CaM associated with the SK-binding domain has shown that the binding domain is composed of two α-helices connected by a short loop (23Schumacher M.A. Rivard A.F. Bachinger H.P. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). The high probability that the two KCNQ regions contain α-helices suggests that a similar conformation to the SK2 CaM-binding domain may also arise in KCNQ. However, some differences are evident. Although in SK channels the connecting loop is only 5 aa long, in KCNQ channels this varies from ∼100 to ∼150 aa. Secondly, the C lobe of CaM (EF hands 3 and 4) is sufficient for binding to SK channels (21Keen J.E. Khawaled R. Farrens D.L. Neelands T. Rivard A. Bond C.T. Janowsky A. Fakler B. Adelman J.P. Maylie J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 8830-8838Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the complete CaM molecule is necessary for binding to KCNQ2 or KCNQ3 channels. In essence, our data suggests that the C-terminal domain of KCNQ channels folds in such a way that helix A and helix B form a compact structure that can be engulfed between the N- and C-terminal lobes of apo-CaM (Fig. 8). What is the role of CaM in KCNQ function? The preassociation of apo-CaM to a target protein whose activity may be regulated by CaM generally ensures a rapid and selective response to local elevations in Ca2+ (8Jurado L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Jarrett H.W. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 661-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 27Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2001; 31: 973-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar). Indeed, the suppression of the M current by bradykinin in rat sympathetic neurons is mediated by this cation (3Cruzblanca H. Koh D.S. Hille B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7151-7156Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and apo-CaM has been shown to modulate the Ca2+-dependent gating of many channels (27Erickson M.G. Alseikhan B.A. Peterson B.Z. Yue D.T. Neuron. 2001; 31: 973-985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar,35Levitan I.B. Neuron. 1999; 22: 645-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-dependent modulation of M channels can also be observed in excised patches. Under these conditions, signaling pathways such as phosphorylation are not supported, and because the effects observed are fully reversible, it becomes very unlikely that the modulation of I Mvia Ca2+ is due to dephosphorylation of the M channel or of an associated protein. Furthermore, the absence of a “signature” flickering behavior and the tendency to “desensitize” in inside-out patches (i.e. the effect is transient) suggests that the activity of Ca2+ does not involve the direct blockage of the internal mouth of the channel (4Selyanko A.A. Brown D.A. Neuron. 1996; 16: 151-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that the mediator exists in limited amounts in excised patches and that it is washed out after the application of Ca2+. These properties suggest the involvement of a Ca2+ sensor such as CaM, which, as we have shown, interacts with the C-terminal intracellular region of KCNQ channels. In this respect, it is interesting to reflect on the fact that helix A is adjacent to the end of S6, the last transmembrane domain (Fig. 8). In other channels with a similar six transmembrane architecture, such as SK Ca2+-activated K+ channels and cyclic nucleotide-gated channels, gating is modulated by a module that attaches to the end of S6 (23Schumacher M.A. Rivard A.F. Bachinger H.P. Adelman J.P. Nature. 2001; 410: 1120-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 36Johnson J.P.J. Zagotta W.N. Nature. 2001; 412: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, we should also bear in mind that the binding of CaM may also be important in other processes such as assembly or trafficking (37Gao T. Bunemann M. Gerhardstein B.L. Ma H. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25436-25444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 38Joiner W.J. Khanna R. Schlichter L.C. Kaczmarek L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 31: 699-711Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W1972071205,"The t(14;18) translocation, which is characteristic of follicular lymphoma, results in the overexpression of the bcl-2 gene dependent upon regulatory elements within the bcl-2 5′ flanking region and the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene enhancers. Conflicting evidence exists on the effects of NF-κB expression on Bcl-2 levels in different cell types. Lymphoma cells with the t(14;18) translocation show high levels of nuclear NF-κB proteins. We observed decreased levels of endogenous Bcl-2 when the IκBα-super-repressor was expressed in a t(14;18) cell line. Deletion analysis of the bcl-2 promoter indicated that the repressive effect of the IκBα-super-repressor occurred through a region that contained no NF-κB consensus sequences. This highly active region contained a c-AMP response element (CRE) and several Sp1 binding sites. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays with antibodies specific for the NF-κB and CREB/ATF family members, as well as Sp1, resulted in the isolation of this IκBα-super-repressor responsive region of the bcl-2 promoter. Mutation of the CRE and the two Sp1 sites in different combinations in bcl-2 reporter constructs resulted in the loss of bcl-2 promoter repression by the IκBα-super-repressor. We therefore conclude that the activation of bcl-2 by NF-κB in t(14;18) lymphoma cells is mediated through the CRE and Sp1 binding sites."
https://openalex.org/W2046542611,"Human cancer is characterized by genetic and epigenetic alterations. In this study we provide evidence for the interruption of Ras signaling in sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) by either genetic activation of the K-ras oncogene or epigenetic silencing of the putative tumor suppressor gene RASSF1A. Paraffin embedded tumor tissue samples from 222 sporadic CRC patients were analysed for K-ras codon 12 and codon 13 activating mutations and RASSF1A promoter hypermethylation. Overall, K-ras mutations were observed in 87 of 222 (39%) and RASSF1A methylation was observed in 45 of 222 (20%) of CRCs. Mutation of K-ras alone was detected in 76 of 222 (34%) CRCs. RASSF1A promoter methylation with wild-type K-ras was observed in 34 of 222 (15%) CRCs. In 101 of 222 (46%) CRCs neither K-ras mutations nor RASSF1A methylation was observed and 11 of 222 (5%) CRCs showed both K-ras mutations and RASSF1A methylation. These data show that the majority of the studied CRCs with K-ras mutations lack RASSF1A promoter methylation, an event which occurs predominantly in K-ras wild-type CRCs (P=0.023, Chi-square test)."
https://openalex.org/W2092243554,"The genetic nature of testicular germ cell tumors and the molecular mechanisms underlying the morphological and clinical differences between the two subtypes, seminomas and nonseminomas, remains unclear. Genetic studies show that both subtypes exhibit many of the same regional genomic disruptions, although the frequencies vary and few clear differences are found. We demonstrate significant epigenetic differences between seminomas and nonseminomas by restriction landmark genomic scanning. Seminomas show almost no CpG island methylation, in contrast to nonseminomas that show CpG island methylation at a level similar to other solid tumors. We find an average of 1.11% of CpG islands methylation in nonseminomas, but only 0.08% methylated in seminomas. Furthermore, we demonstrate that seminomas are more highly hypomethylated than nonseminomas throughout their genome. Since both subtypes are thought to arise from primordial germ cells, the epigenetic differences seen between these subtypes may reflect the normal developmental switch in primordial germ cells from an undermethylated genome to a normally methylated genome. We discuss these findings in relation to different developmental models for seminomatous and nonseminomatous testicular germ cell tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2063699958,"The amyloid precursor protein (APP), a large glycoprotein highly expressed in neurons, is cleaved in its intramembranous domain by γ secretase to generate amyloid-β and a free carboxyl-terminal intracellular fragment (APP-CT), which has previously been suggested to interact with the adapter protein Fe65 and the histone acetyltransferase Tip60. An identical γ secretase activity mediates cleavage of Notch, releasing an intracellular signaling domain that translocates to the nucleus. We examined the effect of an ectopically expressed 58-amino acid APP-CT fragment (APP-C58) on human H4 neuroglioma cells. We demonstrate by confocal microscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis that APP-C58 translocates to the nucleus and forms a complex in the nucleus with the Tip60, independent of interactions with Fe65. APP-C58 transfected H4 cells undergo apoptosis within 48–72 h, marked by nuclear blebbing, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining, and blockade by a caspase inhibitor. When nuclear access of APP-C58 is prevented by fusing with a strong membrane-targeting farnesylation domain, apoptosis is blocked. APP-C58-induced apoptosis was markedly enhanced by co-transfection with wild type Tip60 and decreased by mutant Tip60 lacking histone acetyltransferase activity, suggesting that Tip60 mediates APP-CT-induced cell death. Thus, γ secretase cleavage of APP may contribute to Alzheimer's disease-related neurodegeneration in two ways: release of amyloid-β and liberation of a bioactive carboxyl-terminal domain from membrane-bound APP."
https://openalex.org/W2071812783,"There is mounting evidence that decorin inhibits the growth of various tumor cell lines when either over-expressed in vitro or provided as a recombinant protein. The mechanism of action is primarily via a protracted inactivation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase. In this study we explored the possibility of retarding the growth of tumor xenografts by decorin gene delivery into the growing neoplastic tissues. We demonstrate that transient transgene expression of replication-deficient adenovirus-containing decorin causes a significant growth inhibition of colon and squamous carcinoma tumor xenografts. These cytostatic effects were achieved with relatively low viral titers and correlated with a reduced proliferative index and an attenuation of the EGFR phosphorylation in vivo. Thus, decorin gene therapy helps in retarding the growth of human tumors in immunocompromised animals and could represent a new independent or adjunctive therapeutic modality against cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2316037107,"To examine the effects of Notch signaling on hematopoiesis, we transplanted mice with progenitors transduced with a constitutively active form of Notch1 (Notch1IC) or the Notch1 target genes Hes. Notch1IC-transduced cells induce T cell tumors and cannot generate B lymphocytes in vivo. Hes-transplanted mice remained healthy but cells transduced with Hes1 or Hes5 were partially impaired in their ability to differentiate into B cells. Both Hes1 and Hes5 were upregulated in the BM of Notch1IC mice and their ability to interfere with the transcriptional activity of E2A in a reporter assay was comparable to that of Notch1IC. This suggests that the inhibition of B cell development in the Notch1IC-transduced cells could be mediated by the interference of HES1/HES5 proteins with E2A. Hes1-, Hes5- and Notch1IC-transduced bone marrow cells cultured ex vivo in a colony forming assay in the presence of cytokines that promote myeloid differentiation remained very immature, indicating that the myeloid potential of these bone marrow cells was altered. Thymocytes overexpressing Hes1, Hes5 or Notch1IC matured normally into CD4 and CD8 single positive cells in vivo. Altogether our data suggest that Notch1IC induces T cell tumors independently of Hes genes but that its interference with lymphoid B and myeloid maturation is partly mediated by Hes1 and Hes5. DOI:"

To study the role of NF-kappaB in various TNF-alpha-treated epithelial cell lines, we generated stable transfectants overexpressing a mutated unresponsive form of the IkappaBalpha inhibitor (MT cells). As NF-kappaB prevented TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis in various epithelial cancer cell lines, we searched for NF-kappaB target gene products responsible for this difference of sensitivity. We observed an increased Bcl-X(L) expression level in OVCAR-3 cells compared with OVCAR-3 cells expressing a mutated IkappaBalpha inhibitor (MT cells). Induction of the antioxidant enzyme MnSOD was detected only in TNF-alpha-treated OVCAR, MCF7A/Z and HCT116 cells but not in MT cells. Moreover, reactive oxygen species were involved in TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis, as various antioxidants partially protected these cells from apoptosis. At last, transfection of the MnSOD cDNA in MT cells, which do not express this protein after TNF-alpha stimulation, partially restored resistance to TNF-alpha-induced cell death, as observed by clonogenic assays. However, transfection of the Bcl-X(L) cDNA did not induce any protective effect. Therefore, MnSOD expression is induced by NF-kappaB in epithelial cancer cells in response to TNF-alpha, and is at least partially responsible for their resistance to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis, presumably through the clearance of death-inducing ROS."

https://openalex.org/W2058606238,"Recent findings suggest that DNA alkylating agents trigger cellular responses that overlap those activated after ionizing radiation. Moreover, activation of these responses is dependent upon a functional mismatch repair (MMR) system. These developments led us to test if MMR-deficient cells may be compromised in their ability to activate appropriate cellular signaling pathways after ionizing radiation. An initial experiment to address this notion was to determine the level of radiosensitivity of several MMR-deficient cell lines derived from patients with Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC). While two of the three HNPCC lines investigated show levels of radiosensitivity consistent with that displayed by normal human fibroblasts, HCT-116 cells display moderate radiosensitivity compared to the other MMR-deficient lines. This increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation correlates with lowered levels of ATM expression in HCT-116. Analysis of genomic DNA from HCT-116 cells determined that these cells possess aberrant methylation of multiple CpG dinucleotides within the proximal promoter region of the ATM gene. The significance of this finding is underscored by our observations that co-culturing HCT-116 cells with the DNA demethylating agent 5-azacytidine reverses promoter methylation, promotes normal levels of ATM expression, and restores normal radiosensitivity. The proximal ATM promoter is a approximately 520 bp region shared with the NPAT gene, and current evidence suggests that this region functions as a bi-directional promoter. We found that, unlike ATM, the methylation status of this intergenic region does not effect the expression of the NPAT gene. In sum, these observations indicate that the ATM gene is a novel target for epigentic silencing through inappropriate methylation of its proximal promoter region."

https://openalex.org/W2314221598,"Protein kinase CK2 is a protein serine/threonine kinase that exhibits elevated expression in a number of cancers and displays oncogenic activity in mice. The regulatory CK2beta subunit has a central role in assembly of functional tetrameric CK2 complexes where it participates in modulation of catalytic activity and substrate specificity. Since overexpression of CK2beta results in elevated levels of CK2 activity, we investigated the molecular mechanisms that control its degradation since perturbations in these pathways could contribute to elevated CK2 in cancer. In this study, we demonstrate that CK2beta is degraded by a proteasome-dependent pathway and that it is ubiquitinated. We have also investigated the role of phosphorylation and a putative destruction box in regulating its stability in cells. Importantly, replacement of three serine residues within the autophosphorylation site of CK2beta with glutamic acid residues resulted in a significant decrease in its degradation indicating that autophosphorylation is involved in regulating its stability. Notably, although the autophosphorylation site of CK2beta is remarkably conserved between species, this is the first functional role ascribed to this site. Furthermore, based on these results, we speculate that alterations in the phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of the regulatory CK2beta subunit could underlie the elevated expression of CK2 that is observed in cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2325329824,"Telomerase is a specialized reverse transcriptase that extends telomeres of eukaryotic chromosomes. The catalytic core of human telomerase is composed of an RNA template known as hTER (human telomerase RNA) and a protein subunit named hTERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase). We have been studying other functions of the telomerase besides its major role in telomere maintenance. In our previous work, we have demonstrated that the hTERT can functionally interact with a rabbit TER to regulate expression of other genes and also attenuate the induced apoptosis. Here we report that overexpression of hTERT in a human lens epithelial cell line accelerates growth of the transfected lens epithelial cells. Associated with the acceleration of cell growth, expression of p53, p21 and GCIP (Grap2 cyclin-D interacting protein) is downregulated in the hTERT-transfected cells. With the downregulation of p21 and GCIP, the retinoblastoma protein (RB) is completely hyperphosphorylated in the hTERT-transfected cells. As expected, in the presence of RB hyperphosphorylation, the E2F transactivity is upregulated. Inhibition of telomerase activity abolishes the observed growth acceleration and also the related molecular changes. Furthermore, expression of hTERT in telomerase-negative human lens epithelial cells derived from primary cultures also accelerates growth of the transfected cells. Taken together, our results suggest that hTERT, when overexpressed in human lens epithelial cells, accelerates cell growth rate through regulation of RB/E2F pathway and possibly other genes."

https://openalex.org/W2065173430,"p53 and p73 genes are both activated in response to DNA damage to induce either cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, depending on the strength and the quality of the damaging stimulus. p53/p73 transcriptional activity must be tightly regulated to ensure that the appropriate biological response is achieved and to allow the cell to re-enter into the cell cycle after the damage has been repaired. In addition to multiple transcriptionally active (TA) isoforms, dominant negative (DN) variants, that lack the amino-terminal transactivation domain and function as trans-repressors of p53, p63 and p73, are expressed from a second internal promoter (P2-p73Pr). Here we show that, in response to a non apoptotic DNA damage induced by low doses of doxorubicin, p53 binds in vivo, as detected by a p53-specific chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, and activates the P2-p73 promoter. DN-p73alpha protein accumulates under the same conditions and exogenously expressed DN-p73alpha is able to counteract the p53-induced activation of the P2-p73Pr. These results suggest that DN-p73 may contribute to the autoregulatory loops responsible for the termination of p53/p73 responses in cells that do not undergo apoptosis. Accordingly, the activation of the P2-p73Pr is markedly enhanced in both p73-/- murine fibroblasts and in human cells in which p73 transcripts are selectively knocked-out by p73-specific small interfering RNAs."

The absence of LPL resulted in significantly lower cerebral αTocH concentrations than observed in control animals. lipoprotein lipase low density lipoprotein high density lipoprotein very low density lipoprotein lipoprotein-deficient serum α-tocopherol blood-brain barrier brain capillary endothelial cells acetylated LDL fetal calf serum heparan sulfate proteoglycans scavenger receptor class B, type I transendothelial electrical resistance triglycerides tetrahydrolipstatin Tris-buffered saline multiplicity of infection Lipoprotein lipase (LPL)1 plays a central role in lipoprotein metabolism. LPL is synthesized in most extrahepatic tissues where it is transported to the endothelium (1Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 693-707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Zechner R.

Lutz E.P. Li Z. Paka L. Katopodis T. Strickland D.K. Kozarsky K.F. Pillarisetti S. Goldberg I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8934-8941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). There, LPL hydrolyzes triglycerides (TGs) in chylomicrons and VLDL, thereby generating free fatty acids that enter either storage or oxidative pathways. LPL also contributes to the exchange of lipids and apoproteins between different lipoprotein classes, thus affecting size and composition not only of TG-rich lipoproteins but also of low and high density lipoproteins (LDL and HDL) (1Goldberg I.J. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 693-707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Eisenberg S. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 1017-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its lipolytic function, it was demonstrated that proteoglycan-bound LPL directly interacts with lipoproteins, concentrating lipoprotein particles on the cell surface where they are internalized along with lipoprotein receptors (5Salinelli S.

Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 765-779Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This “bridging function” is independent of the enzymatic activity of LPL. In addition to lipoprotein receptor- or proteoglycan-mediated internalization of lipoproteins, LPL can contribute to selective lipid uptake. During selective uptake, originally lipoprotein-associated lipids from the surface and core are internalized by cells without concomitant endocytosis of the lipid-depleted lipoprotein (holo)particle. This pathway was described for HDL- and LDL-associated lipids to occur via pathways mediated by scavenger receptor BI (SR-BI) (10Pittman R.C. Knecht T.P. Rosenbaum M.S. Taylor Jr., C.A. J. Biol.

Yet there is ample evidence that LPL is functional in this organ: LPL expression was documented in brain microvessels (18Brecher P. Kuan H.T. J. Lipid Res. 1979; 20: 464-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in various brain regions (19Ben-Zeev O. Doolittle M.H. Singh N. Chang C.H. Schotz M.C. J. Lipid Res. 1990; 31: 1307-1313Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is regulated by and responsive to starvation (20Eckel R.H. Robbins R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 7604-7607Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Therefore, it was suggested that LPL at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) could supply the neonatal brain with unsaturated fatty acids during embryonic development (21Nunez M. Peinado-Onsurbe J. Vilaro S. Llobera M. Biol. Neonate. 1995; 68: 119-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the bridging function of LPL was proposed to contribute to the transport of lipoprotein-associated vitamins and cholesterol esters across the BBB (2Zechner R. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 77-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by the fact that tissue-specific overexpression of LPL in transgenic animals results in significantly increased α-tocopherol (αTocH) concentrations at the site of LPL expression (22Sattler W. Levak-Frank S. Radner H. Kostner G.M. Zechner R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). During the present study we examined the pathways of LDL holoparticle and selective LDL-αTocH uptake in primary porcine brain capillary endothelial cells (BCECs) and the modulation of these pathways by LPL. In addition, we have studied whether LPL affects transcytosis rates of LDL particles across an in vitro model of the BBB and whether targeted knock-out of the LPL gene affects cerebral αTocH levels. Earl's medium M199, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 (1:1, v/v) medium, penicillin/streptomycin, gentamicin,l-glutamine, and trypsin were obtained from Biochrom (Berlin, Germany). Ox serum was from PAA Laboratories (Linz, Austria). Plastic ware for cell culture and Transwell inserts (polycarbonate membrane, 0.4-μm pore size) were from Costar (Vienna, Austria). Na125I (specific activity 629 GBq/mg) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences (Vienna), [14C]all-rac-αTocH (termed [14C]αTocH throughout the manuscript; specific activity 2.07 GBq/mmol) was from Amersham Biosciences (Tokyo, Japan). PD-10 size-exclusion columns, heparin-Sepharose, dNTPs, RNAguard, and random hexamer primers were obtained from Amersham Biosciences. An RNeasy kit was from Qiagen (Vienna); poly(A)+ RNA from human placenta was from CLONTECH (Heidelberg, Germany). RQ1 RNase-free DNase I was from Promega (Mannheim, Germany). Dithiothreitol, 1× First Strand Buffer, and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase were from Invitrogen (Vienna). PCR buffer and Finnzyme DyNAzyme II DNA polymerase were from Finnzymes Oy (Vienna). PCR primers were from MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany). Porcine BCECs were isolated by sequential enzymatic digestion and centrifugation steps according to Tewes et al. (23Tewes B. Franke H. Hellwig S. Hoheisel D. Decker S. Griesche G. Tilling T. Wegener J. Galla H.J. Drug Transport across the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB): In Vivo and in Vitro Techniques. Harwood Academic Publisher, Amsterdam1997: 91-97Google Scholar) and characterized as described previously (24Goti D. Hammer A. Galla H.J. Malle E. Sattler W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1374-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). During the first 2 days in vitro, BCECs (from one brain) were cultured in eight 75-cm2 rat tail collagen-coated culture flasks in M199 containing 10% ox serum, 0.1 mg/ml gentamicin, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. After 2 days in vitro the cells were seeded on collagen-coated multiwell cell culture clusters at a minimum density of 30,000 cells/cm2 in M199 medium containing 10% ox serum, 2 mm glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. Human LDL was prepared by density gradient ultracentrifugation of plasma obtained from normolipidemic human volunteers in a TL120 tabletop ultracentrifuge (at r av 350,000 ×g, Beckman, Vienna) (25Sattler W. Mohr D. Stocker R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 233: 469-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). LDL was recovered by direct aspiration and desalted by size exclusion chromatography on PD-10 columns. Molar concentrations were calculated from total lipoprotein mass using a molecular mass of 2500 kDa for LDL (26Chapman J.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 70-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Acetylation of LDL was performed as described by Basu et al. (27Basu S.K. Goldstein J.L. Anderson G.W. Brown M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 3178-3182Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Iodination of LDL was performed as described (28Sinn H.J. Schrenk H.H. Friedrich E.A. Via D.P. Dresel H.A. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 170: 186-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) using N-Br-succinimide as the coupling agent. Routinely 1 mCi of Na125I was used to label 3 mg of LDL protein. This procedure resulted in specific activities between 300 and 450 dpm/ng of protein. Lipid-associated activity was always less than 3% of total activity. No fragmentation of apoB-100 due to the iodination procedure could be detected by SDS or native PAGE and subsequent autoradiography or Coomassie staining. LDL (0.6 mg of protein, final volume 2 ml in phosphate-buffered saline) was labeled by direct addition of an ethanolic [14C]αTocH solution and incubation at 37 °C (3 h, under argon, shaking water bath (24Goti D. Hammer A. Galla H.J. Malle E. Sattler W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1374-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar)). Non-lipoprotein-associated [14C]αTocH was removed by size exclusion chromatography on PD-10 columns. The labeling procedures did not affect the LDL integrity as verified by native PAGE. LPL was isolated from fresh, unpasteurized bovine milk (1 liter) exactly as described previously (29Wicher I. Sattler W. Ibovnik A. Kostner G.M. Zechner R. Malle E. J. Immunol. Meth. 1996; 192: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE (8%) followed by Coomassie Blue staining. Yields for LPL ranged from 500 to 1500 μg of LPL/liter of milk with activities between 400 and 700 μmol of free fatty acids/h/mg of LPL protein. SDS-PAGE of detergent-extracted BCEC membrane proteins was performed on 8% gels with electrophoresis at 150 V for 90 min in a Bio-Rad Miniprotean chamber. For SDS-PAGE, samples (50 μg of protein/lane) were treated with sample buffer (0.1m Tris/HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 15% glycerol, and 1% mercaptoethanol) at a ratio of 1:1 (v/v). For Western blots, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (150 mA, 4 °C, 90 min). Immunochemical detection of LPL was performed with a polyclonal anti-human LPL antiserum (29Wicher I. Sattler W. Ibovnik A. Kostner G.M. Zechner R. Malle E. J. Immunol. Meth. 1996; 192: 1-11Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), SR-BI was detected with a sequence-specific polyclonal rabbit anti-rat SR-BI IgG (Abcam, UK, dilution 1:1000), and the LDL-receptor was detected with a monoclonal antibody (clone C7, dilution 1:250). Immunoreactive bands were visualized with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or rabbit anti-mouse IgG (dilution 1:2000) and subsequent ECL development. BCECs were cultured on rat-tail collagen-coated multiwell cluster plates. 125I- and [14C]αTocH-labeled LDL were added to the medium at the indicated concentrations. At the end of the incubation the cells were washed twice with ice-cold TBS containing bovine serum albumin (2 mg/ml), followed by another two washes with ice-cold TBS. Cells were lysed by treatment with NaOH (0.3 n, 25 °C, 30 min). An aliquot of the cell lysate was used to determine the cellular protein concentration, and the remaining lysate was mixed with scintillation mixture to determine the radioactivity. For 125I-LDL uptake experiments, cells were plated on 12-well cluster plates. Incubations were performed in the absence or presence of a 20-fold excess of non-labeled lipoprotein to differentiate between total and specific cell association or binding. To differentiate between degraded, internalized, and bound fractions the medium was removed and the amount of non-trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity was determined as described below. Cells were then washed and incubated in the presence of heparin (100 units/ml), and the released radioactivity is referred to as the “bound” fraction. The cells were then washed again and lysed in NaOH (0.3 n), and the remaining radioactivity is referred to as the “internalized” fraction. Degradation of 125I-LDL was estimated by measuring the non-trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactivity in the medium after precipitation of free iodine with AgNO3 (24Goti D. Hammer A. Galla H.J. Malle E. Sattler W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1374-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). [14C]αTocH-LDL uptake is expressed in terms ofapparent particle uptake (HDL-protein equivalents). Based on the specific activity of the labeled lipoprotein preparations, the amount of lipoprotein that would be necessary to deliver the observed amount of tracer was calculated. This is necessary to allow quantitative comparison of data between lipoprotein-particle independent (selective) lipid uptake by non-endocytotic mechanisms and lipoprotein-dependent (holoparticle) uptake (10Pittman R.C. Knecht T.P. Rosenbaum M.S. Taylor Jr., C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2443-2450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The polycarbonate filters of Transwell inserts (Costar, Vienna, 12-mm diameter, 0.4-μm pore size) were coated with rat tail collagen (6 μg in 100 μl of sterile 0.1% acetic acid, aspirated after 5 min) and dried. Cells were seeded at 100,000 cells/cm2 on Transwell inserts in M199 (containing 10% ox serum, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% gentamicin, and 0.35% glutamine (v/v)). The medium used to induce the formation of tight monolayers was added after 2 days and consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/Ham's F-12 with 30% (v/v) astrocyte-conditioned medium (ATCC number CRL-1718, human astrocytoma), 150 nmhydrocortisone, 1% antibiotics, and 0.35% glutamine (v/v). After 3 days in culture, before starting the experiment, the tightness of the monolayer was assessed by measuring [14C]sucrose permeability and the trans-endothelial electrical resistance (TER). The adenoviral plasmid shuttle vector (pAvCvSv) and pJM17 vectors were kindly supplied by L. Chan (Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX). Human SR-BI cDNA (kindly supplied by H. Hauser, Eidgenoessische Technische Hochschule, Zürich, Switzerland), which was originally inserted into pcEXV-3 vector, was partially restricted withEcoRI, and the 2.5-kb band was eluted from the gel. This band was subcloned into pBluescript using theEcoRI site, amplified, and restricted with KpnI, and the fragment was finally partially restricted with BamHI and inserted in the plasmid shuttle vector. Adenovirus infection of BCECs was performed as described previously (30Goti D. Hrzenjak A. Levak-Frank S. Frank S. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Malle E. Sattler W. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 498-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) to obtain transiently transfected cells. Interbreeding of heterozygous LPL knock-out mice (L1) resulted in the progeny of three different genotypes, L2 (wild type, 25%), L1 (heterozygous, 50%), and L0 (homozygous LPL knock-out mice, 25%) (31Weinstock P.H. Bisgaier C.L. Aalto-Setälä K. Radner H. Ramakrishnan R. Levak-Frank S. Essenburg A.D. Zechner R. Breslow J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2555-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Genotyping was performed from tail tip DNA by PCR analysis as reported previously (31Weinstock P.H. Bisgaier C.L. Aalto-Setälä K. Radner H. Ramakrishnan R. Levak-Frank S. Essenburg A.D. Zechner R. Breslow J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 2555-2568Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). L0 animals die postnatally between 18 and 24 h after birth; therefore, L2, L1, and L0 mice were killed between 0 and 4 h after birth (using an overdose of isoflurane inhalation). Brains were removed (average weight, ∼65 mg of wet tissue) and transferred to liquid nitrogen. The snap-frozen tissues were homogenized in liquid nitrogen, and the αTocH content was determined as described (22Sattler W. Levak-Frank S. Radner H. Kostner G.M. Zechner R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Statistical differences were analyzed by using Student's t test with the level of significance set at 0.05. All data are expressed as mean ± S.D. Box Whiskers plots were generated with the GraphPad prism package. In cell lysates obtained from a BCEC population with ≥95% purity (as assessed by immunocytochemistry with anti-factor VIII and anti-smooth muscle cell actin IgG) immunoreactive porcine LPL comigrated with bovine LPL and was detected at ∼60 kDa (Fig.1 A). To determine the effects of LPL on cell association of 125I-LDL to BCECs, cells were incubated at increasing LPL:LDL molar ratios (Fig.1 B). The addition of LDL and enzymatically active LPL at increasing molar ratios dose-dependently increased the total cell association of 125I-LDL, indicating that LPL increases binding and/or uptake of LDL. The most pronounced effect (∼11-fold increase, 403 versus 4529 ng/mg of cell protein) was observed at a molar ratio of 100:1 (LPL:LDL, 120 μg/ml LPL and 50 μg/ml LDL). At the concentration ranges tested during these experiments the effect of LPL tended to level off but did not reach a real saturation plateau. To assess whether this increase in cell association is due to enzymatically active LPL, incubations were performed in the presence of tetrahydrolipstatin (THL), a potent inhibitor of LPL activity (Fig.2 A). In the absence of LPL, THL and heparin were without effect on LDL association. The addition of LPL to the medium (molar ratio of LPL:LDL = 100) resulted in a pronounced, 11-fold increase of cell-associated LDL that was independent of the presence of THL. This indicates that the observed LPL-mediated effect does not depend on its TG-hydrolase activity and thus results from the “bridging function” of the enzyme. More than 50% of 125I-LDL was not heparin-releasable, indicating efficient lipoprotein particle uptake (Fig. 2 B). As LPL was discussed to contribute to the supply of the central nervous system with lipophilic vitamins, the effect of LPL on the uptake of LDL-associated [14C]αTocH was investigated. In principle, uptake of LDL-associated αTocH can occur by holoparticle uptake, selective uptake, or a combination of both pathways. The effect of LPL on either of these pathways is shown in TableI. In line with our previous results (24Goti D. Hammer A. Galla H.J. Malle E. Sattler W. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 1374-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), αTocH uptake exceeded holoparticle uptake (14Cversus 125I), indicating selective uptake of αTocH. The addition of LPL to the incubation medium resulted in significantly enhanced 125I- and [14C]αTocH-LDL association (4- to 10-fold) in a time-dependent manner (1–5 h). The addition of LPL augmented selective αTocH uptake at 3 and 5 h (3- and 4.7-fold, respectively). These findings indicate that LPL is able to promote LDL holoparticle uptake and selective uptake of LDL-associated αTocH in endothelial cells constituting the BBB.Table IEffect of LPL on LDL holoparticles and apparent [14C]αTocH particles, and selective [14C]αTocH uptake in BCECsIncubations[14C]αTocH-LDL125I-LDL14C − 125Iμg LDL/mg cell protein1-h incubationLDL1.5 ± 0.10.5 ± 0.11.0LDL + LPL5.4 ± 0.65.2 ± 0.10.23-h incubationLDL3.6 ± 0.30.7 ± 0.72.9LDL + LPL16.0 ± 0.67.3 ± 0.18.75-h incubationLDL5.2 ± 0.50.9 ± 0.14.3LDL + LPL29.1 ± 2.98.7 ± 0.220.4Cells were incubated in the presence of 15 μg of 125I- or [14C]αTocH-labeled LDL in the absence or presence of LPL (20 μg).

The fact that BCECs express the LDL-receptor (32Dehouck B. Fenart L. Dehouck M.P. Pierce A. Torpier G. Cecchelli R. J.

During these experiments (Fig.3) LDL-receptor expression was either down-regulated (incubation in FCS, inset lane 1) or up-regulated (preincubation in LPDS, inset lane 2), and then the cells were incubated with 125I-LDL or125I-acLDL in the absence or presence of LPL. A preincubation of BCECs in LPDS-containing medium in the absence of LPL led to a 2-fold increase of 125I-LDL binding (56versus 30 ng/mg of cell protein). The addition of LPL to FCS-preincubated cells resulted in a 27-fold increase in125I-LDL binding. The effect of LPL was even more pronounced in LPDS-preincubated cells where the addition of LPL resulted in a 44-fold increase in 125I-LDL binding. To exclude the possibility that the effects described in Fig. 3 are due to up-regulation of SR-BI, the same experiments were performed with acLDL, which is a ligand for SR-BI but not for the LDL-receptor (Fig. 3). As observed with native LDL, the binding of acLDL was increased 1.5-fold in response to LPDS. However, the effects of LPL were much weaker with acLDL and led to 4- and 8-fold increases (FCS and LPDS, respectively) of acLDL binding. To further explore whether the LDL-receptor is involved in LPL-dependent LDL particle turnover at 37 °C, the next series of experiments was performed under FCS or LPDS conditions and LDL binding, internalization, and degradation were determined (Fig.4). Under these experimental conditions, the addition of LPL led to a pronounced 3.3-fold increase of binding at the beginning of the experiment, an effect that was further increased by a preincubation in LPDS-containing medium (4.7-fold, Fig.4 A). At longer incubation times this effect was ablated, due to internalization of the originally surface-bound particles. Up-regulated LDL-receptor expression resulted in ∼2-fold higher LDL internalization rates (Fig. 4 B). The presence of LPL increased 125I-LDL internalization between 8- and 18-fold. In line with data shown in Fig. 4 (A and B), degradation of 125I-LDL (Fig. 4C) was considerably enhanced under LPDS conditions and the presence of exogenous LPL: when cells were preincubated in LPDS, a 1.2-fold increase in overall degradation was observed. In the presence of LPL the degradation rates were increased 3.7-fold (LPL and FCS) and 4.4-fold (LPL and LPDS), respectively. In summary, the data shown in Fig. 4 strengthen the concept that LPL-supported LDL particle turnover by BCECs is modulated at the level of LDL-receptor expression. The prime candidate receptor mediating selective uptake of lipoprotein-associated lipids is SR-BI. During preliminary experiments we have tested whether SR-BI contributes to selective uptake of LDL-associated αTocH in transiently SR-BI-transfected COS cells. These experiments revealed that high level SR-BI overexpression resulted in only slightly increased (1.5-fold) selective uptake of LDL-associated αTocH (data not shown). To further determine whether SR-BI and LPL could act synergistically on αTocH uptake, BCECs were transfected by an adenoviral approach (30Goti D. Hrzenjak A. Levak-Frank S. Frank S. van der Westhuyzen D.R. Malle E. Sattler W. J. Neurochem. 2001; 76: 498-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Along this line it is important to note that the virus concentrations needed to obtain feasible transfection rates (∼70%) were 100 times higher for BCECs as compared with COS cells (m.o.i. 1000 versus 10 in COS cells). Transfection of BCECs with a control virus (containing the β-galactosidase reporter gene) was without effect on selective αTocH uptake (Fig. 5), whereas adenoviral transduction of SR-BI resulted in a 2.5-fold increase in selective LDL-αTocH uptake. Addition of LPL resulted in 5.5- and 5.9-fold higher selective LDL-αTocH uptake in wild-type and SR-BI-transfected cells, respectively. Thus, it appears that LPL-mediated induction of selective LDL-αTocH uptake is independent of SR-BI expression. When cells were treated with NaClO3(an inhibitor of proteoglycan sulfation) prior to the uptake experiments, selective uptake of αTocH was significantly attenuated (2-fold), indicating that HSPG mediates at least part of LPL-dependent selective uptake of LDL-associated αTocH. Cell viability was not affected by the presence of NaClO3(>95% viable cells after 72 h as determined by trypan blue exclusion).

Here, endothelial GM7373 cells spread and organize focal adhesion plaques on immobilized FGF2, fibronectin (FN), and vitronectin (VN). αvβ3 integrin, paxillin, focal adhesion kinase, vinculin and pp60src localize in cell-substratum contact sites on FGF2, FN or VN. However, only immobilized FGF2 induces a long-lasting activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases1/2 (ERK1/2) and cell proliferation that was inhibited by the ERK1/2 inhibitor PD 098059 and the tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitor tyrphostin 23, pointing to the engagement of FGF receptor (FGFR) at the basal side of the cell. To assess this hypothesis, GM7373 cells were transfected with a dominant negative TK−-ΔFGFR1 mutant (GM7373-ΔFGFR1 cells) or with the full-length receptor (GM7373-FGFR1 cells). Both transfectants adhere and spread on FGF2 but GM7373-ΔFGFR1 cells do not proliferate. Also, parental and GM7373-FGFR1 cells, but not GM7373-ΔFGFR1 cells, undergo morphological changes and increased motility on FGF2-coated plastic. Finally, FGFR1, but not TK−-ΔFGFR1, localizes in cell adhesion contacts on immobilized FGF2. In conclusion, substrate-bound FGF2 induces endothelial cell proliferation, motility, and the recruitment of FGFR1 in cell-substratum contacts. This may contribute to the cross talk among intracellular signaling pathways activated by FGFR1 and αvβ3 integrin in endothelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2313051429,"Nearly all cases of Ewing Family Tumors (EFT) harbor chimeric EWS/ETS transcription factors which are thought to aberrantly regulate transcriptional targets of phenotypic consequence. We have recently demonstrated that EWS/ETS proteins up-regulate platelet derived growth factor-C (PDGF-C), a novel transforming growth factor. To determine if PDGF-C signaling contributes to the malignant phenotype of EFT cell lines, we attempted to disrupt this presumed autocrine loop. AG1296, a PDGF receptor selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor, markedly inhibits anchorage-independent growth in an EFT cell line. To effect specific disruption, we have developed a dominant negative form of PDGF-C which is appropriately secreted and processed. This mutant has greatly reduced activity as a PDGF receptor agonist. When co-expressed with PDGF-C in a fibroblast transformation model, this dominant negative dramatically inhibits anchorage-independent growth. When this mutant is expressed in EFT cell lines, there is a similar reduction in anchorage-independent growth. This demonstrates that specific inhibition of PDGF-C signaling in EFT cell lines partially reverts their phenotype. These data support a significant role of PDGF-C in the biology of EFT. They also suggest that PDGF-C driven signaling may be a possible therapeutic target of more clinically relevant tyrosine kinase inhibitors."

RA induces the differentiation of F9 cells grown as monolayers into endodermal-like cells and decreases their rate of proliferation. Knock-out of the retinoic X receptor α (RXRα) gene abolishes endodermal differentiation and the induction of several endogenous RA-responsive genes. RXRα null cells are also drastically impaired in their antiproliferative response to RA. The role of the RXRα phosphorylation site located in the N-terminal A region (Ser22) has been investigated here by establishing cell lines re-expressing RXRα either wild type or mutated at the phosphorylation site (RXRαS22A) in a RXRα-null background. We show that Ser22 is dispensable for RA-induced endodermal differentiation but is crucial for the expression of several RA-responsive genes. Ser22 is also indispensable for the antiproliferative effect of RA and necessary for the RA-induced down-regulation of p21CIP and p27KIPCKIs proteins that are known to be involved in the control of cell cycle progression.

RA exerts its effects through two families of nuclear ligand-dependent transcriptional regulators, the retinoic acid receptors (RARs) and the retinoid X receptors (RXRs). There are three RAR (α, β, and γ) and three RXR isotypes (α, β, and γ), and for each isotype, there are at least two main isoforms that are generated by differential promoter usage and alternative splicing and that differ only in their N-terminal A region (Refs. 5Leid M.

F9 murine embryonal carcinoma cells provide a powerful cell autonomous model system for investigating retinoid signaling in vitro (for review see Ref. 8Rochette-Egly C. Chambon P. Histol. Histopathol. 2001; 16: 909-922PubMed Google Scholar and references therein). Upon RA treatment, and depending on culture conditions, F9 cells differentiate into three distinct cell types resembling primitive, parietal, and visceral endodermal extraembryonic cells (9Gudas L.J. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Roberts A.B. Goodman D.S. The Retinoids: Biology, Chemistry and Medecine. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1994: 443-520Google Scholar). This RA-induced differentiation is also accompanied by a decrease in the rate of proliferation and the induction of expression of a number of genes. F9 cells express all RAR and RXR isotypes, with RXRα1, RARα1, and RARγ2 being the main isoforms. Two strategies have been used to investigate their roles in the response of F9 embryonal carcinoma cells to RA treatment. Firstly, F9 cells lacking one or several RARs or RXRs were engineered through homologous recombination (10Boylan J.F. Lohnes D. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

These studies demonstrated that RARγ2/RXRα heterodimers are the functional units transducing most RA-induced events (e.g.primitive and visceral differentiation, growth arrest, and activation of expression of a number of genes), whereas RARα/RXRα heterodimers mediate some other events such as parietal differentiation. RARs and RXRs possess two transcriptional activation functions (AFs): AF-1 located in the N-terminal A/B region (19Nagpal S. Saunders M. Kastner P. Durand B. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. Cell. 1992; 70: 1007-1019Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 20Nagpal S. Friant S. Nakshatri H. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2349-2360Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) and AF-2 associated with the ligand-binding domain and activated by the ligand (Refs. 6Chambon P. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 940-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (2606) Google Scholar and21Durand B. Saunders M. Gaudon C. Roy B. Losson R. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5370-5382Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar and references therein). The AF-1 domain of RARs is phosphorylated at conserved residues that belong to consensus sites for proline-directed kinases, which include the cyclin-dependent kinases and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (for review see Refs. 22Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar and 23Pearson G. Robinson F. Beers Gibson T. Xu B.E. Karandikar M. Berman K. Cobb M.H. Endocr. Rev. 2001; 22: 153-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (3564) Google Scholar). In RARα1 and RARγ2, the phosphorylated residues have been identified and found to be located in the conserved B region (24Rochette-Egly C. Adam S. Rossignol M. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1997; 90: 97-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar, 25Bastien J. Adam-Stitah S. Riedl T. Egly J.M. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21896-21904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). RXRα1 is also phosphorylated, but the phosphorylation site (serine 22) is located in the RXRα1-specific A region (26Adam-Stitah S. Penna L. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18932-18941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because the various RA-responses of F9 cells can be restored upon re-expression of WT RARγ in RARγ-null cells (27Taneja R. Bouillet P. Boylan J.F. Gaub M.P. Roy B. Gudas L.J. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7854-7858Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), the role of the activation functions AF-2 and AF-1 and that of the phosphorylation of RARγ2 in RA-induced events have been studied by re-expressing a variety of RARγ2 mutants in these cells (RARγΔAF-2, RARγΔAF-1, and RARγS66/68A “rescue” lines). This strategy allowed us to demonstrate that RARγ2 needs the integrity of both its AF-1 and AF-2 domains to efficiently transduce the RA signal (18Taneja R. Rochette-Egly C. Plassat J.L. Penna L. Gaub M.P. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6452-6465Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 28Plassat J. Penna L. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2887-2895PubMed Google Scholar). RARγ2 further requires the phosphorylation site of its AF-1 domain for inducing RA target gene and F9 cell differentiation (18Taneja R. Rochette-Egly C. Plassat J.L. Penna L. Gaub M.P. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6452-6465Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation is also necessary for the RA-induced degradation of RARγ2 by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (29Kopf E.

By contrast, little is known about the mechanisms through which RXR exerts its transcriptional activity. In vitro studies demonstrated that liganded RXR is not active unless its RAR partner is itself liganded (16Roy B. Taneja R. Chambon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6481-6487Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Taneja R. Roy B. Plassat J.L. Zusi C.F. Ostrowski J. Reczek P.R. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Phenotypic analysis of mice expressing RXRα with its N-terminal A/B region deleted indicated that the RXRα AF-1 domain is functionally important for efficiently transducing the retinoid signal during embryonic development (32Mascrez B. Mark M. Krezel W. Dupe V. LeMeur M. Ghyselinck N.B. Chambon P. Development. 2001; 128: 2049-2062PubMed Google Scholar). However, little is known about the mechanisms through which the N-terminal A region and its phosphorylation site participate in the global activity of RXRα under physiological conditions. Because RXRα-null F9 cells are drastically impaired in primitive and parietal endodermal differentiation as well as in their antiproliferative response to RA (14Clifford J. Chiba H. Sobieszczuk D. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4142-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), we functionally dissected the role of RXRα Ser22 in these processes by establishing a rescue line expressing RXRαS22A in a RXRα-null background. Our results demonstrate that in F9 cells Ser22 is dispensable for primitive and subsequent parietal endodermal differentiation but is required for the induction of several RA-responsive genes. This phosphorylation site is also crucial for the antiproliferative effect of RA. In that context, Ser22 is necessary for the RA-induced decrease in the levels of p21CIP and p27KIP proteins that are involved in the control of cell cycle progression. The mouse full-length cDNA of RXRα1 was cloned into the pD402A vector (a gift of D. Lohnes), which is driven by the PGK promoter (33Adra C.N. Boer P.H. McBurney M.W. Gene (Amst.). 1987; 60: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). RXRαS22A in PD402A was constructed by subcloning the XhoI-SacI fragment containing the mutation from the pSG5-mRXRα construct (26Adam-Stitah S. Penna L. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18932-18941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) into the same sites of pD402A RXRαWT. F9 cells were cultured as monolayers on gelatinized surfaces as described previously (10Boylan J.F. Lohnes D. Taneja R. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9601-9605Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). For differentiation studies, 105 cells were cultured in 10-cm dishes and treated with tRA (100 nm) alone or in combination with 250 μm dibutyryl-cAMP (Sigma) for 96 h with a medium change after 48 h. The control cells were treated with vehicle (final ethanol concentration, 0.1%). To establish the rescue lines, RXRα−/− cells (4.5 × 106 cells) were electroporated with the constructs indicated in Fig. 1 A linearized with AatII, along with a XhoI-linearized plasmid conferring resistance to hygromycin in a ratio of 10:1. After 24 h, the cells were selected with hygromycin (400 μg/ml) for 10 days (27Taneja R. Bouillet P. Boylan J.F. Gaub M.P. Roy B. Gudas L.J. Chambon P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7854-7858Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and analyzed for the presence and expression of the transgene by Southern and Western blotting. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies raised against the A region of RXRα1, RPRXα(A), were as described (34Rochette-Egly C. Lutz Y. Pfister V. Heyberger S. Scheuer I. Chambon P. Gaub M.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 204: 525-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Those against p21CIP (C-19) and p27KIP (Ab-2) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) and NeoMarkers (Lab Vision Corp.), respectively. Goat polyclonal antibodies raised against β-actin were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Whole cell extracts (WCEs) were prepared as described previously (35Rochette-Egly C. Lutz Y. Saunders M. Scheuer I. Gaub M.P. Chambon P. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The proteins (40 μg) were resolved by SDS-PAGE (12% acrylamide), electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose filters, immunoprobed, and detected by chemilumiscence according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Biosciences). Total RNAs were isolated using the guanidinium thiocyanate method (36Bouillet P. Oulad-Abdelghani M. Vicaire S. Garnier J.M. Schuhbaur B. Dolle P. Chambon P. Dev. Biol. 1995; 170: 420-433Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and the aliquots (500 ng) were subjected to real time quantitative RT-PCR, using the SYBR Green Light cycler detection system (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The transcripts levels were normalized according to 36B4 transcripts, which are unresponsive to retinoids treatment. The RT-PCR oligonucleotides for 36B4, Collagen IV, Laminin B1, HNF3α, and HNF1β were as described (14Clifford J. Chiba H. Sobieszczuk D. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4142-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 18Taneja R. Rochette-Egly C. Plassat J.L. Penna L. Gaub M.P. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6452-6465Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The primers were: Stra6, 5′-CTGCAGACCAGCTACTCCGA-3′ and 5′-ACAGTAGGCACCACGCTCAC-3′; Hoxa-1, 5′-GAGCTGGAGAAGGAGTTCCA-3′ and 5′-CAGAGTTGGGCTGGAGTAGC-3′; Hoxb-1, 5′-CTCGAAGACTTTCCCAAACTTCAC-3′ and 5′-TCTCTAAGCTCAAAGGCACTGAAC-3′; CRABPII, 5′-AACCTCCACCACTGTGCGAA-3′ and 5′-AGGCAGTTCTTGGACCCGTA-3′; p21CIP, 5′-GCCGTGATTGCGATGCGCTC-3′ and 5′-CTCCTGACCCACAGCAGAAG-3′; and p27KIP, 5′-GAGTCAGCGCAAGTGGAATTT-3′ and 5′-GCC- TGTAGTAGAACTCGGGCA-3′. Cell counting experiments were performed in triplicate with untreated and RA-treated cells as follows. The cells were plated at identical densities (2.5 × 103 cells/well) in 6-well plates and fed with fresh medium containing either vehicle or RA (100 nm) every 2 days. At days 3 and 5, the remaining adherent cells were trypsinized and counted with a Coulter particle counter (Coultronics France, SA). The percentage of growth inhibition by RA was calculated as described previously (14Clifford J. Chiba H. Sobieszczuk D. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4142-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The cell cycle profiles of F9 WT, RXRα−/−, RXRαWT, and RXRαS22A cells were determined by cell cycle flow cytometry based on cellular DNA content analysis using a FACScan (Beckton Dickinson, Inc.). Subconfluent cultures of control or RA-treated cells were trypsinized and combined with their culture supernatants, pelleted, resuspended in 500 μl of hypotonic buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium citrate) containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide, and incubated for 15 h in the dark at 4 °C. The percentage of cells in the different phases of the cell cycle was determined using the Cell Quest software. The data are expressed as the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments unless otherwise indicated. Statistical analysis was performed using the analysis of variance followed by 2 × 2 comparisons based on the Newman-Keul's test. We have previously shown that RXRα is “constitutively” (i.e.in the absence of ligand) phosphorylated at serine 22 in COS-1 cells (26Adam-Stitah S. Penna L. Chambon P. Rochette-Egly C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18932-18941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) and also in F9 cells. 2J. Bastien, S. Adam-Stitah, and C. Rochette-Egly, unpublished results. To investigate whether this phosphorylation of RXRα is involved in primitive and parietal endodermal differentiation of F9 cells, as well as in their antiproliferative response to RA, rescue lines re-expressing wild type RXRα (RXRαWT line) or RXRα mutated at the phosphorylation site (RXRαS22A line) were derived from RXRα-null cells (Fig. 1 A). Two clones were obtained for the RXRαWT rescue transgene and one clone for the RXRαS22A rescue transgene. The presence of the S22A mutation was verified by sequencing cDNA fragments amplified by RT-PCR from total RNA of the RXRαS22A rescue line (data not shown). The expression level of RXRαWT and RXRαS22A in the derived cell lines was compared with the expression of endogenous RXRα in F9 WT cells after immunoblotting. RXRαS22A was expressed in the corresponding rescue line at levels similar to that of RXRα in F9 WT cells (Fig.1 B, lane 4). The RXRαWT rescue lines slightly overexpressed the RXRα protein relative to endogenous RXRα. Because they yielded similar results in the studies described thereafter, one was selected (Fig. 1 B, lane 3). When grown as monolayers in the presence of RA for 96 h, F9 WT cells differentiate into primitive endoderm-like cells (37Strickland S. Mahdavi V. Cell. 1978; 15: 393-403Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1134) Google Scholar) exhibiting a characteristic flat triangular morphology (Fig.2 A, panel b). The addition of cAMP along with RA results in the formation of parietal endoderm-like cells (38Strickland S. Smith K.K. Marotti K.R. Cell. 1980; 21: 347-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar), which have a rounded and refractile appearance (Fig. 2 A, panel c). These two types of differentiation are drastically impaired in RXRα−/−cells (14Clifford J. Chiba H. Sobieszczuk D. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4142-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A, compare panels e andf with panels b and c), and re-expression of RXRαWT (RXRαWT rescue line) restores the RA responsiveness (Fig. 2 A, panels g–i). Similarly, the RXRαS22A rescue line differentiates upon treatment with RA alone or with RA plus cAMP (Fig. 2 A, panels j–l), indicating that RXRα can efficiently mediate the induction of primitive and parietal endoderm differentiation in the absence of Ser22. The differentiation of the various rescue lines was further analyzed by determining the expression of two markers of primitive endodermal differentiation, laminin B1 and collagen IV(α1), using quantitative RT-PCR. RA-induced expression of laminin B1 and collagen IV (Fig. 2,B and C, columns 1), which was impaired in RXRα−/− cells (14Clifford J. Chiba H. Sobieszczuk D. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4142-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, Band C, columns 2), was restored in the RXRαWT rescue line to levels similar to those achieved in F9 WT cells (Fig. 2,B and C, columns 3). In agreement with the morphological differentiation, the expression of these two markers was completely restored in the RXRαS22A rescue line (Fig. 2, B and C, columns 4). Altogether, these results indicate that Ser22, located in the N-terminal A region of RXRα, is dispensable for RA-induced endodermal differentiation of F9 cells. Similar results were obtained concerning parietal endodermal differentiation as assessed by the expression of a specific marker, thrombomodulin (data not shown) (39Rochette-Egly C. Plassat J.L. Taneja R. Chambon P. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1398-1410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Knock-out of the RXRα gene in F9 cells results in a drastic reduction of the expression of several RA-responsive genes (13Chiba H. Clifford J. Metzger D. Chambon P. Mol. Cell.

We investigated the ability of RXRαWT and RXRαS22A to rescue the expression of these RA target genes, using quantitative real time RT-PCR after treatment of the different cell lines with 100 nm RA for 24 h. Re-expression of RXRαWT restored the expression of all genes tested to levels significantly similar to those achieved in F9 WT cells (Fig. 3, compare lanes 1 and3 in each panel). RXRαS22A also restored the expression of Stra6 and Hoxa-1 with the same efficiency as RXRαWT (Fig. 3,A and B, compare lanes 1 and4). However, RXRαS22A did not restore the expression of HNF3α, CRABPII, Hoxb-1, nor HNF1β to the levels achieved in WT cells (Fig. 3, C–F, compare lanes 1 and4; p < 0.001). No responsiveness was observed for up to 96 h of RA treatment, (data not shown), indicating that the RXRαS22A mutant does not lead to a delayed activation of these RA target genes. Collectively, our results indicate that Ser22 is crucial for the induction of several RA target genes expression and that this process is promoter context-dependent. Note that a difference in the stability of the mutant receptor is ruled out, because RXRαWT and RXRαS22A levels are not affected within 48 h of RA treatment.2 RA-induced differentiation of F9 cells is also accompanied by a marked decrease in their proliferation rate as determined by counting of the adherent cells with 58 and 84% growth inhibition at 3 and 5 days of RA treatment, respectively (Fig. 4). This antiproliferative response to RA is significantly reduced in RXRα−/− cells (14Clifford J. Chiba H. Sobieszczuk D. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4142-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), which exhibit only 32 and 54% growth inhibition upon 3 and 5 days of RA treatment, respectively (Fig.4). Re-expression of RXRαWT restored the antiproliferative response to RA with a growth inhibition similar to that observed in F9 WT cells (Fig. 4). In contrast, the RXRαS22A rescue line depicted a different behavior. Indeed, at 3 days of RA treatment, the RXRαS22A rescue line retained an antiproliferative response that was not significantly different from that of RXRα−/− cells (Fig.4 A; p > 0.05). However, after 5 days of RA treatment, the growth inhibition was slightly rescued but was still significantly different from that of WT cells (Fig. 4 B;p < 0.05). Thus, RXRα appears to mediate part of the antiproliferative effect of RA through the Ser22phosphorylation site. Previous studies have shown that RA treatment of F9 cells also results in the lengthening of the G1 portion of the cell cycle and that this effect is less pronounced for RXRα−/− cells (14Clifford J. Chiba H. Sobieszczuk D. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4142-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated by cell cycle flow cytometry (see “Experimental Procedures”) whether RXRα Ser22 is also involved in the RA-induced accumulation in the G1 phase. The untreated WT, RXRαWT, or RXRαS22A cell lines exhibited similar cell cycle profiles, with some insignificant fluctuations reflecting variations in the basal proliferation rate (TableI). Note that the RXRα−/−line depicting a lower proportion of cells in the G1 phase may be due to a slight higher basal proliferation rate (14Clifford J. Chiba H. Sobieszczuk D. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4142-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).Table IThe phosphorylation site of RXRα (Ser22) is indispensable for the RA-induced accumulation of F9 cells into the G1 phase of the cell cycleDay 5Cell cycle phaseF9 cellsWild typeRXRα−/−RXRαWTRXRαS22A−RAG0136 ± 0.5828 ± 1.5333 ± 1.1631 ± 0.33S35393839G2/M29333130+RAG0/G153 ± 0.8836 ± 1.21-aThese differences are statistically significant between WT cells and the different cell lines, upon RA treatment (p < 0.001).50 ± 1.2137 ± 1.451-aThese differences are statistically significant between WT cells and the different cell lines, upon RA treatment (p < 0.001).S26341836G2/M18302625F9 wild type RXRα−/−, RXRαWT, and RXRαS22A cells were grown for 5 days in the presence of 100 nm RA.

The percentages of cells in the different phases of the cell cycle were analyzed with an fluorescence-activated cell sorter as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values correspond to the percentages of cells in the G0/G1, S, and G2/M phases. RA treatment of F9 WT cells for 5 days resulted in an accumulation of the cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle from 36 ± 0.58 to 53 ± 0.88% (Table I). This accumulation was significantly decreased in RXRα−/− cells (14Clifford J. Chiba H. Sobieszczuk D. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4142-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) with 36 ± 1.2% of cells in G1 instead of 53% for WT cells (Table I, p < 0.001). The RXRαWT rescue cell line recovered a proportion of cells in the G1 phase that was similar to that observed with WT F9 cells (Table I). In contrast, in RA-treated RXRαS22A cells, the proportion of cells in the G1 phase remained statistically the same as that of RXRα−/− cells (Table I). Collectively, these results indicate that RXRα Ser22 plays a crucial role in the antiproliferative effect of RA. To corroborate the role of RXRα Ser22 in the antiproliferative effect of RA, we investigated its contribution to the regulation of some G1phase-associated molecules that have been shown to be targets for RA action (40Hayashi K.

We focused upon the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21CIP and p27KIP. The expression of p27KIP and p21CIP transcripts did not vary significantly upon RA treatment of F9 WT cells up to 96 h (data not shown). However, p27KIP and p21CIP protein levels were strongly decreased within 48 and 72 h, respectively (Fig. 5), indicating that in F9WT cells, the antiproliferative effect of RA correlates with a down-regulation of these CKIs. Interestingly, in RXRα-null cells, the RA-induced down-regulation of p27KIPwas delayed and occurred at 96 h instead of 48 h (Fig.5 A), whereas that of p21CIP was completely abolished (Fig. 5 B). The down-regulation of both CKIs was fully restored in the RXRαWT rescue line (Fig. 5). However, in the RXRαS22A line, the decrease in p27KIP was not rescued (Fig. 5 A), whereas that in p21CIP was restored with a delay (Fig. 5 B). Altogether, these data indicate that, in F9 cells, the RA-induced down-regulation of p27KIPand to a lesser extent of p21CIP requires the phosphorylation site located in the A region of RXRα. Because p21CIP and p27KIP proteins are essentially regulated post-transcriptionally by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (46Sheaff R.J. Singer J.D. Swanger J. Smitherman M. Roberts J.M. Clurman B.E.

Biol. 2001; 11: 263-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), we investigated whether in F9 cells, the RA-induced down-regulation of these CKIs involves the activation of this pathway. Treatment of control cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 did not significantly affect p21CIP protein levels but markedly increased p27KIP (Fig. 6 A), suggesting that in F9 cells, the proteasome-dependent pathway is involved in the turnover of this CKI. In contrast, in RA-treated F9 cells, MG132 abrogated the decrease in p21CIPlevels (Fig. 6 B) but not that of p27KIP (Fig.6 C). Altogether, these results suggest that the down-regulation of p21CIP induced by RA involves the proteasome pathway, whereas that of p27KIP may occur through an other mechanism. The present investigation was designed to analyze the contribution of the constitutively phosphorylated serine residue located in the N-terminal A region of RXRα (Ser22), in the control of F9 cells differentiation and growth arrest, and in the expression of RA target genes. To that end, we used rescue RXRα-null F9 cells re-expressing RXRα either WT or mutated at Ser22. Analysis of the RA response of these cell lines allows us to draw the following conclusions. First, we demonstrate that the phosphorylation site located in the N-terminal A region of RXRα is dispensable for the RA-induced differentiation of F9 cells, because the line rescued with RXRαS22A is able to differentiate into primitive endoderm-like cells and subsequently into parietal endodermal cells. Second, RXRα Ser22 is necessary for the induction of certain RA target genes. In F9 cells, the expression of most RA-responsive genes such as Hoxa-1, HNF3α, HNF1β, Stra6, and CRABPII, is known to be controlled by RARγ/RXR heterodimers, whereas the induction of Hoxb-1 can be mediated by either RARγ/RXR or RARα/RXR heterodimers (8Rochette-Egly C. Chambon P. Histol. Histopathol. 2001; 16: 909-922PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of these genes is strongly decreased or abrogated in RXRα-null cells (13Chiba H. Clifford J. Metzger D. Chambon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3013-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 14Clifford J. Chiba H. Sobieszczuk D. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4142-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrate that the N-terminal phosphorylation site of RXRα is necessary for the RA-induced expression of some of these genes, such as HNF3α, HNF1β, CRABPII, and Hoxb-1, because RXRαS22A is inefficient in restoring their inducibility. This may result from distinct steric conformations of the AF-1 domain of RXRα bound to different promoters and therefore from different interactions with putative AF-1 coactivators that could be differentially modulated by phosphorylation. In this respect, we note that the phosphorylation of the A/B domain of some nuclear receptors has been shown to modulate their interaction with coactivators or their ligand affinity. For example, phosphorylation of the estrogen receptor A/B domain promotes recruitment of the SRC-1 coactivator (52Tremblay A. Tremblay G.B. Labrie F. Giguere V. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 513-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation of the PPARγ A/B domain reduces the ligand binding affinity of the receptor, thus negatively regulating its transcriptional activity (53Shao D. Rangwala S.M. Bailey S.T. Krakow S.L. Reginato M.J. Lazar M.A. Nature. 1998; 396: 377-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 54Hu E. Kim J.B. Sarraf P. Spiegelman B.M. Science. 1996; 274: 2100-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Third, RXRα Ser22 is required for the antiproliferative response to RA and the accumulation in the G1 phase, which are severely altered in RXRα-null cells (14Clifford J. Chiba H. Sobieszczuk D. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4142-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In several cell lines, the growth inhibitory effect of RA has been correlated to the expression level of RARβ2 (15Faria T.N. Mendelsohn C. Chambon P. Gudas L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26783-26788Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 55Sun S.Y. Wan H. Yue P. Hong W.K. Lotan R. J. Biol.

However, our results are not consistent with such a mechanism, because RARβ2 is similarly induced in F9 WT cells, RXRα-null cells (13Chiba H. Clifford J. Metzger D. Chambon P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3013-3020Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 14Clifford J. Chiba H. Sobieszczuk D. Metzger D. Chambon P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4142-4155Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and the different rescue lines (data not shown). In fact, progression through the cell cycle is ensured by a number a factors including cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases, and CKIs (22Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar, 57Ekholm S.V. Reed S.I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 676-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 58Malumbres M. Barbacid M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2001; 1: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (1175) Google Scholar). Although considerable advances have been made in understanding the role of these factors in G1 progression, how RA controls the coordinated action of these molecules in F9 cells is not completely elucidated. However, according to a number of reports, the antiproliferative effect of RA has been associated with variations in the expression of the CKIs p21CIP and p27KIP (40Hayashi K. Yokozaki H. Naka K. Yasui W. Yajin K. Lotan R. Tahara E. Cancer Lett. 2000; 151: 199-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 41Dirks P.B. Patel K. Hubbard S.L. Ackerley C. Hamel P.A. Rutka J.T.

Cell Res. 1997; 234: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Initially considered as inhibitors of proliferation, increasing evidence now suggests that CKIs play a complex role and may be also associated with cell cycle progression (59Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5159) Google Scholar, 60LaBaer J. Garrett M.D. Stevenson L.F. Slingerland J.M. Sandhu C. Chou H.S. Fattaey A. Harlow E.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1571-1583Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). Accordingly, depending on the cell system, either increases or decreases in CKIs levels have been associated with the antiproliferative effect of RA. In the present study performed with F9 cells, we found that RA down-regulates p21CIP and p27KIP levels. The mechanism of this down-regulation remains to be investigated. Similarly, how this down-regulation participates in the antiproliferative effect of RA is still unknown. Nevertheless, the important point of the present investigation is that the phosphorylation site localized in the N-terminal region of RXRα1, which is involved in the antiproliferative effect of RA, is also required for the RA-induced variations in the levels of some proteins engaged in G1progression. The identification of the RA-responsive genes specifically involved in the regulation of cell cycle progression would provide new insights for understanding cell cycle regulation and the role of RXRα in RA signaling.

Both Nde1p/Nde2p and Gut2p are located in the inner mitochondrial membrane with catalytic sites facing the intermembranal space.

Second, the activation of NADH dehydrogenase inhibited the Gut2p in such a manner that, at a saturating concentration of NADH, glycerol 3-phosphate is not used as respiratory substrate. This effect was not a consequence of a direct action of NADH on Gut2p activity because both NADH dehydrogenase and its substrate were needed for Gut2p inhibition. This kinetic regulation of the activity of an enzyme as a function of the rate of another having a similar physiological function may be allowed by their association into the same supramolecular complex in the inner membrane.

Rev. 1986; 32: 199-225Crossref Google Scholar), and the redox couple NAD+/NADH cannot pass the mitochondrial membrane. Hence, systems for NADH turnover in mitochondria as well as in the cytosol are required during both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The reason being is that several processes result in production of NADH, i.e.several processes are contrary to ethanol fermentation not redox-neutral. Synthesis of 1 mol of glycerol, the second major by-product of glucose-fermenting cells of S. cerevisiae, results in consumption of 1 mol of NADH, while other by-products like acetate lead to the production of cytosolic NADH. However, the largest part of excess cytosolic NADH formation is connected to biomass production (3Albers E. Larsson C. Lidén G. Niklasson C. Gustafsson L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Albers E. Lidén G. Larsson C. Gustafsson L. Pandalai S.G. Recent Research Developments in Microbiology. Vol. 2, part I. Research Signpost, India1998: 253-279Google Scholar). Synthesis of proteins, nucleic acids, and even the highly reduced lipids are associated with the assimilatory NADH production. In particular, NADH is generated in the biosynthetic pathways of amino acid synthesis (3Albers E. Larsson C. Lidén G. Niklasson C. Gustafsson L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Albers E. Lidén G. Larsson C. Gustafsson L. Pandalai S.G. Recent Research Developments in Microbiology. Vol. 2, part I. Research Signpost, India1998: 253-279Google Scholar). Anaerobically, the only means by which S. cerevisiae can reoxidize surplus production of NADH is by glycerol production (2Van Dijken J.P. Scheffers W.A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 32: 199-225Crossref Google Scholar, 5Nordström K. J. Inst. Brew. 1968; 74: 429-432Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Aerobically, several systems for conveying excess cytosolic NADH to the mitochondrial electron transport chain exist in S. cerevisiae (6Bakker B.M. Overkamp K.M. van Maris A.J. Kotter P. Luttik M.A. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 15-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two most important systems in this respect seem to be the external NADH dehydrogenase (Nde1p/Nde2p) (7Luttik M.A.H. Overkamp K.M. Kötter P. de Vries S. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. J. Biol.

Yeast. 1998; 14: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The Nde1p/Nde2p localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane with the catalytic sites projecting toward the intermembrane space are proved to directly oxidize cytosolic NADH (7Luttik M.A.H.

J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4051-4055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The glycerol 3-phosphate shuttle system, involving the FAD-dependent Gut2p (10Rönnow B. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Yeast. 1993; 9: 1121-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), which is situated in the inner membrane of the mitochondria with the catalytic site projecting toward the cytosol, is also shown to be active in maintaining a cytosolic redox balance (9Larsson C. Påhlman I.-L. Ansell R. Rigoulet M. Adler L. Gustafsson L. Yeast. 1998; 14: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In this system the cofactor, NADH, is oxidized to NAD+ by the cytosolic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gpd1p) when catalyzing the reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP)1 to glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P). Subsequently G3P delivers its electrons to the respiratory chain via the Gut2p, and DHAP will reappear.It is believed that the Nde1p/Nde2p is used preferentially over the Gut2p system when cells grow fast and a high ATP-producing capacity per unit of time is needed (9Larsson C. Påhlman I.-L. Ansell R. Rigoulet M. Adler L. Gustafsson L. Yeast. 1998; 14: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 11Påhlman I.-L. Gustafsson L. Rigoulet M. Larsson C. Yeast. 2001; 18: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the Gut2p shuttle system is more efficient in producing ATP, i.e. the phosphate to oxygen ratio is higher and is believed to be important when cells have a reduced growth rate (9Larsson C. Påhlman I.-L. Ansell R. Rigoulet M. Adler L. Gustafsson L. Yeast. 1998; 14: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 11Påhlman I.-L. Gustafsson L. Rigoulet M. Larsson C. Yeast. 2001; 18: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the Gut2p system becomes less important when increasing the dilution rate in ethanol-limited chemostat cultures of S. cerevisiae(9Larsson C. Påhlman I.-L. Ansell R. Rigoulet M.

Yeast. 2001; 18: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and additionally it is less important when maintenance requirements are increased by lowering external pH values (9Larsson C. Påhlman I.-L. Ansell R. Rigoulet M. Adler L. Gustafsson L. Yeast. 1998; 14: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar).Furthermore, results from a study on glucose-limited chemostat cultures of S. cerevisiae showed that when deleting Nde1p/Nde2p higher yields of glycerol were obtained when increasing the dilution rate compared with the wild type and the gut2Δ mutant (12Overkamp K.M. Bakker B.M. Kötter P. van Tuijl A. de Vries S. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2823-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It seems as if the two systems are able to, at least in part, substitute for each other, but the capacity of the Gut2p system is not enough to completely replace Nde1p/Nde2p activity during the growth conditions used. Deleting Nde1p and Nde2p together with Gut2p lead to a more severely affected phenotype, i.e. even more glycerol but no ethanol was formed with the increasing dilution rate (12Overkamp K.M. Bakker B.M. Kötter P. van Tuijl A. de Vries S. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2823-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar).The two enzyme systems, the external NADH dehydrogenase and the G3P shuttle, obviously have a similar metabolic function, and hence concerted regulation can be envisaged. In a recent study by Grandier-Vazeille et al. (13Grandier-Vazeille X. Bathany K. Chaignepain S. Camougrand N. Manon S. Schmitter J.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9758-9769Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) it is found that five known intermembrane space-facing dehydrogenases (Nde1p, Nde2p, Gut2p, Dld1p, and Cyb2p) are associated in a complex. They suggest a possible channeling effect of substrates and products as a result of the close physical contact between the enzymes. Moreover, this observation opens up the possibility to explain regulatory mechanisms in a completely new way. Is it possible that close physical interactions between enzymes provide a mode of regulating enzyme activities?The aim of this study was to analyze the functional relationship between the two cytosolic NADH re-oxidation systems, Nde1p/Nde2p and Gut2p.DISCUSSIONIn S. cerevisiae there are several systems used for cytosolic oxidation of NADH, the most important ones probably being the external NADH dehydrogenase and the G3P shuttle (7Luttik M.A.H.

Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2823-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Their respective role is still to a large extent an open question. Because the external NADH dehydrogenase and the G3P shuttle fulfil the same physiological function one would expect some kind of regulatory interactions between the two systems.This study showed that indeed there are interactions between the two external inner membrane enzymes, Nde1p/Nde2p and Gut2p. Deletion of one of the external dehydrogenases caused an increased affinity of the remaining enzyme for its substrate and enhanced its efficiency. The increase in efficiency suggests a specific alteration of the remaining enzyme rather than a general modification of the membrane properties like a change in lipid composition (for review see Ref. 18Lenaz G. Curatola G. Mazzanti L. Parenti-Castelli G. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1978; 22: 3-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Moreover, another membrane enzyme, such as succinate dehydrogenase, does not display the same change in kinetic parameters after removal of Gut2p and Nde1p/Nde2p (data not shown). The result seems to indicate that the close physical contact between the two dehydrogenases previously reported (13Grandier-Vazeille X. Bathany K. Chaignepain S. Camougrand N. Manon S. Schmitter J.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 9758-9769Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) influences the apparent kinetic properties of these membranal enzymes. Thus the increased affinity may be explained by an improved accessibility of the enzyme for its substrate in the absence of the alternative dehydrogenase. A similar observation,i.e. an increased affinity for NADH of the external NADH dehydrogenase correlated to a decrease in the amount of Gut2p, was obtained in a chemostat study at different dilution rates and with nitrogen or glucose as the limiting substrate (11Påhlman I.-L. Gustafsson L. Rigoulet M. Larsson C. Yeast. 2001; 18: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).The most important result from this study is that NADH addition inhibited mitochondrial glycerol 3-phosphate consumption. However, there was no direct effect of NADH on Gut2p activity (Fig. 2), but the presence of both the external NADH dehydrogenase and its substrate were needed to observe this effect (Figs. 1 and 2). Hence an active external NADH dehydrogenase is a prerequisite for inhibition of the Gut2p in isolated mitochondria. These observations are in contrast to the results obtained with dehydrogenases facing the matrix, e.g.when using succinate in combination with ethanol, an additive effect is instead seen on respiratory activity (19Boumans H. Grivell L.A. Berden J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4872-4877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, the fact that a (unphysiologically) high NADH concentration completely blocks Gut2p activity does not rule out the possibility that both systems are in use simultaneously in vivo. The intracellular NADH concentration is most probably very low. During anaerobic conditions, which are known to provoke an elevated NADH level (20Beauvoit B. Rigoulet M. Bunoust O. Raffard G. Canioni P. Guérin B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 163-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), an NADH concentration of ∼0.2 mm (assuming an intracellular volume of 2 ml/g, dry weight) has been reported (21Anderlund M. Nissen T.L. Nielsen J. Villadsen J. Rydström J. Hahn-Hägerdal B. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1999; 65: 2333-2340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The K 0.5 values of the NADH respiration ranging from 0.02 to 0.07 mm in this study also suggests that in vivo NADH concentrations are very low. Consequently, at such low NADH concentrations it is not obvious that the external NADH activity completely blocks the Gut2p. Indeed, when keeping NADH levels low by using the NADH-generating system it was possible to obtain simultaneous activity of both the external NADH dehydrogenase and the Gut2p although at saturating concentrations of glycerol 3-phosphate (Fig. 3). Furthermore, simultaneous activity of the Gut2p and external NADH dehydrogenase has been indicated during growth on ethanol and especially at low dilution rates (9Larsson C. Påhlman I.-L. Ansell R. Rigoulet M. Adler L. Gustafsson L. Yeast. 1998; 14: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 22Costenoble R. Valadi H. Gustafsson L. Niklasson C. Johan Franzen C. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1483-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Gut2p inhibition by the external NADH dehydrogenase activity strongly supports the idea that the dehydrogenases are in physical contact with each other. As a consequence the regulation depends on the relative proportion of the two enzymes. Indeed it was shown that the amount of Gut2p decreased more than the Nde1p/Nde2p when increasing the specific growth rate in glucose-limited chemostats (11Påhlman I.-L. Gustafsson L. Rigoulet M. Larsson C. Yeast. 2001; 18: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In other words, this result also proposes that the role of Gut2p is most significant at low growth rates.In conclusion, this study clearly established that the kinetic properties of one membrane enzyme were dependent on the presence of another membrane enzyme with a similar physiological function. Furthermore, the activity of the external NADH dehydrogenase had an inhibitory effect on the external glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Consequently, NADH is an indirect effector of also the alternative cytosolic NADH oxidizing system, i.e. the glycerol 3-phosphate shuttle. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae lacks transhydrogenase activity (1Bruinenberg P.M. Jonker J. van Dijken J.P. Scheffers W.A. Arch. Microbiol. 1985; 142: 302-306Crossref Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 2Van Dijken J.P. Scheffers W.A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 32: 199-225Crossref Google Scholar), and the redox couple NAD+/NADH cannot pass the mitochondrial membrane. Hence, systems for NADH turnover in mitochondria as well as in the cytosol are required during both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The reason being is that several processes result in production of NADH, i.e.several processes are contrary to ethanol fermentation not redox-neutral. Synthesis of 1 mol of glycerol, the second major by-product of glucose-fermenting cells of S. cerevisiae, results in consumption of 1 mol of NADH, while other by-products like acetate lead to the production of cytosolic NADH. However, the largest part of excess cytosolic NADH formation is connected to biomass production (3Albers E. Larsson C. Lidén G. Niklasson C. Gustafsson L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Albers E. Lidén G. Larsson C. Gustafsson L. Pandalai S.G. Recent Research Developments in Microbiology. Vol. 2, part I. Research Signpost, India1998: 253-279Google Scholar). Synthesis of proteins, nucleic acids, and even the highly reduced lipids are associated with the assimilatory NADH production. In particular, NADH is generated in the biosynthetic pathways of amino acid synthesis (3Albers E. Larsson C. Lidén G. Niklasson C. Gustafsson L. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1996; 62: 3187-3195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Albers E. Lidén G. Larsson C. Gustafsson L. Pandalai S.G. Recent Research Developments in Microbiology. Vol. 2, part I. Research Signpost, India1998: 253-279Google Scholar). Anaerobically, the only means by which S. cerevisiae can reoxidize surplus production of NADH is by glycerol production (2Van Dijken J.P. Scheffers W.A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1986; 32: 199-225Crossref Google Scholar, 5Nordström K. J. Inst. Brew. 1968; 74: 429-432Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Aerobically, several systems for conveying excess cytosolic NADH to the mitochondrial electron transport chain exist in S. cerevisiae (6Bakker B.M. Overkamp K.M. van Maris A.J. Kotter P. Luttik M.A. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 15-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The two most important systems in this respect seem to be the external NADH dehydrogenase (Nde1p/Nde2p) (7Luttik M.A.H. Overkamp K.M. Kötter P. de Vries S. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24529-24534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 8Small W.C. McAlister-Henn L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4051-4055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the glycerol 3-phosphate shuttle (9Larsson C. Påhlman I.-L. Ansell R. Rigoulet M. Adler L. Gustafsson L. Yeast. 1998; 14: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The Nde1p/Nde2p localized in the inner mitochondrial membrane with the catalytic sites projecting toward the intermembrane space are proved to directly oxidize cytosolic NADH (7Luttik M.A.H. Overkamp K.M. Kötter P. de Vries S. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24529-24534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 8Small W.C. McAlister-Henn L. J. Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 4051-4055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The glycerol 3-phosphate shuttle system, involving the FAD-dependent Gut2p (10Rönnow B. Kielland-Brandt M.C. Yeast. 1993; 9: 1121-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), which is situated in the inner membrane of the mitochondria with the catalytic site projecting toward the cytosol, is also shown to be active in maintaining a cytosolic redox balance (9Larsson C. Påhlman I.-L. Ansell R. Rigoulet M. Adler L. Gustafsson L. Yeast. 1998; 14: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In this system the cofactor, NADH, is oxidized to NAD+ by the cytosolic glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gpd1p) when catalyzing the reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP)1 to glycerol 3-phosphate (G3P). Subsequently G3P delivers its electrons to the respiratory chain via the Gut2p, and DHAP will reappear. It is believed that the Nde1p/Nde2p is used preferentially over the Gut2p system when cells grow fast and a high ATP-producing capacity per unit of time is needed (9Larsson C. Påhlman I.-L. Ansell R. Rigoulet M. Adler L. Gustafsson L. Yeast. 1998; 14: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 11Påhlman I.-L. Gustafsson L. Rigoulet M. Larsson C. Yeast. 2001; 18: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). On the other hand, the Gut2p shuttle system is more efficient in producing ATP, i.e. the phosphate to oxygen ratio is higher and is believed to be important when cells have a reduced growth rate (9Larsson C. Påhlman I.-L. Ansell R. Rigoulet M. Adler L. Gustafsson L. Yeast. 1998; 14: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 11Påhlman I.-L. Gustafsson L. Rigoulet M. Larsson C. Yeast. 2001; 18: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the Gut2p system becomes less important when increasing the dilution rate in ethanol-limited chemostat cultures of S. cerevisiae(9Larsson C. Påhlman I.-L. Ansell R. Rigoulet M. Adler L. Gustafsson L. Yeast. 1998; 14: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 11Påhlman I.-L. Gustafsson L. Rigoulet M. Larsson C. Yeast. 2001; 18: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and additionally it is less important when maintenance requirements are increased by lowering external pH values (9Larsson C. Påhlman I.-L. Ansell R. Rigoulet M. Adler L. Gustafsson L. Yeast. 1998; 14: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Furthermore, results from a study on glucose-limited chemostat cultures of S. cerevisiae showed that when deleting Nde1p/Nde2p higher yields of glycerol were obtained when increasing the dilution rate compared with the wild type and the gut2Δ mutant (12Overkamp K.M. Bakker B.M. Kötter P. van Tuijl A. de Vries S. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 2823-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). It seems as if the two systems are able to, at least in part, substitute for each other, but the capacity of the Gut2p system is not enough to completely replace Nde1p/Nde2p activity during the growth conditions used.

Indeed, when keeping NADH levels low by using the NADH-generating system it was possible to obtain simultaneous activity of both the external NADH dehydrogenase and the Gut2p although at saturating concentrations of glycerol 3-phosphate (Fig. 3). Furthermore, simultaneous activity of the Gut2p and external NADH dehydrogenase has been indicated during growth on ethanol and especially at low dilution rates (9Larsson C. Påhlman I.-L. Ansell R. Rigoulet M. Adler L. Gustafsson L. Yeast. 1998; 14: 347-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 22Costenoble R. Valadi H. Gustafsson L. Niklasson C. Johan Franzen C. Yeast. 2000; 16: 1483-1495Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Gut2p inhibition by the external NADH dehydrogenase activity strongly supports the idea that the dehydrogenases are in physical contact with each other. As a consequence the regulation depends on the relative proportion of the two enzymes. Indeed it was shown that the amount of Gut2p decreased more than the Nde1p/Nde2p when increasing the specific growth rate in glucose-limited chemostats (11Påhlman I.-L. Gustafsson L. Rigoulet M. Larsson C. Yeast. 2001; 18: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In other words, this result also proposes that the role of Gut2p is most significant at low growth rates. In conclusion, this study clearly established that the kinetic properties of one membrane enzyme were dependent on the presence of another membrane enzyme with a similar physiological function. Furthermore, the activity of the external NADH dehydrogenase had an inhibitory effect on the external glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. Consequently, NADH is an indirect effector of also the alternative cytosolic NADH oxidizing system, i.e. the glycerol 3-phosphate shuttle."

As yet, the number and identities of the genes that are inactivated in cancer cells has not been determined. In order to address this issue, we have performed a comprehensive isolation of CpG islands that are methylated in human lung adenocarcinomas. We have isolated approximately 200 CpG islands that are methylated in tumor DNA including those of known tumor-associated genes such as the HOXA5 gene. As the library contains the CpG islands of a number of known tumor suppressor genes it is highly likely that additional, previously unidentified tumor suppressor genes, will be present. On average, 1-2% of CpG islands were methylated specifically in tumors although this figure differed greatly between patients. This study provides an important resource in the search for genes inactivated in tumors and for the investigation of epigenetic dysregulation of gene expression by CpG island methylation."

Our previous studies and others also documented a role of PML in transcriptional regulation through its association with transcription coactivator CBP and transcription corepressor HDAC. Here, we showed that PML is a potent transcriptional repressor of Nur77, an orphan receptor and a member of the steroid receptor superfamily of proteins. We found that PML represses Nur77-mediated transactivation through a physical and functional interaction between the two proteins. PML interacts with Nur-77 in vitro in a GST-pull down assay and in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation assay. PML/Nur77 colocalized in vivo in a double immunofluorescent staining and confocal microscopic analysis. Our study further showed that the coiled-coil domain of PML interacts with the DNA-binding domain of Nur77 (amino acids 267-332). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that PML interferes with Nur77 DNA binding in a dose-dependent manner. This study indicates that PML interacts with the DNA-binding domain of Nur77 and represses transcription by preventing it from binding to the target promoter. This study supports a role of PML/Nur77 interaction in regulating cell growth and apoptosis."

In this study, a genetic approach was used to identify cellular processes that were regulated by Ras/PKA signaling activity. Interestingly, we found that mutations affecting the C-terminal domain (CTD), of Rpb1p, the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, were very sensitive to changes in Ras signaling activity. The Rpb1p CTD is a highly conserved, repetitive structure that is a key site of control during the production of a mature mRNA molecule. We found that mutations compromising the CTD were synthetically lethal with alterations that led to elevated levels of Ras/PKA signaling. Altogether, the data suggested that Ras/PKA activity was negatively regulating a protein that functioned in concert with the CTD during RNA pol II transcription.

Cell. 1985; 40: 27-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). However, despite the obvious importance of this signaling pathway, only a few PKA substrates important for the control of yeast cell growth have been identified (7Reinders A. Burckert N. Boller T.

Microbiol. 1999; 33: 904-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar).The entry into stationary phase is accompanied by broad changes in the patterns of gene expression that are controlled, in part, by the Ras/PKA pathway (10Werner-Washburne M. Braun E. Johnston G.C. Singer R.A. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 383-401Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11DeRisi J.L. Iyer V.R. Brown P.O.

However, it is not yet known precisely how Ras activity influences the transcriptional apparatus. In S. cerevisiae, RNA polymerase (pol) II exists as a large holoenzyme complex that contains the 12-subunit polymerase, the Mediator co-activator complex, the Srb8-11 protein complex, and several general transcription factors (13Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This holoenzyme is recruited to active promoters as a result of specific interactions between Mediator subunits and the DNA-bound transactivators present at these promoters (14Keaveney M. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 917-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 15Ptashne M. Gann A. Nature. 1997; 386: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Therefore, there are at least two potential targets for the Ras effects on RNA pol II activity as follows: the various transcription factors bound at the individual promoters, and the regulatory proteins associated with the RNA pol II holoenzyme. A number of studies already indicate that the Ras pathway regulates the activity of specific promoter-bound transcriptional regulators, like Msn2p and Msn4p (9Thevelein J.M. de Winde J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 904-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 16Gorner W. Durchschlag E. Martinez-Pastor M.T. Estruch F. Ammerer G. Hamilton B. Ruis H. Schuller C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 586-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). In contrast, although a few studies (12Chang Y.W. Howard S.C. Budovskaya Y.V. Rine J. Herman P.K.

Chang Y.W. Budovskaya Y.V. Herman P.K. Genetics. 2001; 159: 77-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have hinted at the possibility, there have been no reports of signaling pathways directly targeting components within the RNA pol II holoenzyme.Although RNA pol II transcription is controlled at multiple levels, it is clear that the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Rpb1p, the largest subunit of RNA pol II, is a key site of regulation. The Rpb1p CTD is a highly conserved, repetitive structure that is required for many aspects of mRNA production including pre-initiation complex formation, transcript elongation, and processing of the nascent transcript (20Greenleaf A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10896-10897Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar,21Hirose Y. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1415-1429PubMed Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, the CTD consists of 26 or 27 repeats of the consensus heptamer, Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7(22Allison L.A. Moyle M. Shales M. Ingles C.J. Cell. 1985; 42: 599-610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar, 23Corden J.L. Cadena D.L. Ahearn J.M., Jr. Dahmus M.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 7934-7938Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The CTD is phosphorylated by multiple protein kinases including Kin28p/Cdk7 in the general transcription factor, TFIIH, Srb10p/Cdk8 in the Srb complex, and Ctk1p/Cdk9 (24Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These kinases are generally specific for either serine 2 or serine 5 of the individual repeats. Although all of the details are not yet understood, this phosphorylation clearly plays an important role in the regulation of CTD function (25Corden J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 26Bentley D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). For example, the Mediator complex specifically associates with RNA pol II enzymes that contain a hypophosphorylated CTD (27Hengartner C.J. Myer V.E. Liao S.M. Wilson C.J. Koh S.S. Young R.A. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 43-53Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 28Kim Y.J. Bjorklund S., Li, Y. Sayre M.H. Kornberg R.D.

The subsequent phosphorylation of the CTD by Kin28p results in the release of the Mediator and the association of a complex of proteins important for transcriptional elongation (30Otero G. Fellows J., Li, Y. de Bizemont T. Dirac A.M. Gustafsson C.M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Svejstrup J.Q. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 109-118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). Therefore, a complete understanding of the mechanisms regulating mRNA production will require a thorough working knowledge of the Rpb1p CTD.We are interested in defining the role played by the S. cerevisiae Ras/PKA signaling pathway in the control of stationary phase entry and general cell growth. In this study, we identified specific genetic interactions between mutations affecting the Ras pathway and those affecting the Rpb1p CTD or proteins that function through this domain. These genetic data suggested that the Ras/PKA pathway was negatively regulating activities associated with the Rpb1p CTD. Consistent with this prediction, we found that increased Ras signaling resulted in phenotypes similar to those observed in mutants that encode a Rpb1p with a truncated CTD. These CTD truncation mutants are viable but exhibit specific defects in growth and RNA pol II transcription. Altogether, the data suggest that S. cerevisiae growth control and RNA pol II transcription might be coupled by using the Ras pathway to regulate CTD function. The relative merits of a transcriptional control mechanism that directly targets proteins within the RNA pol II holoenzyme is discussed.DISCUSSIONThis report describes a functional interaction that exists between the S. cerevisiae Ras/PKA signaling pathway and the C-terminal domain, or CTD, of Rpb1p, the largest subunit of RNA pol II. This connection was initially suggested by the lethality observed when Ras/PKA activity was elevated in mutants defective for RNA pol II transcription. The ensuing analysis indicated that the Rpb1p CTD was critical for these genetic interactions as mutations that compromised CTD function were the most sensitive to changes in Ras/PKA signaling activity. Altogether, the data suggested that Ras/PKA activity was influencing RNA pol II transcription at select promoters by regulating the function of the Rpb1p CTD. Because Ras/PKA signaling did not significantly affect the phosphorylation state of the CTD, we suggest that the Ras/PKA pathway is instead targeting proteins that function in concert with the Rpb1p CTD.In the simplest sense, two types of models could be invoked to explain the genetic data presented here. In the first, the Ras/PKA pathway would be targeting some process unrelated to RNA pol II transcription. The observed growth defects would then be due to the additive effects of compromising this second process in a cell that is already defective for RNA pol II transcription. In the other model, the Ras/PKA pathway would be directly targeting a component of the RNA pol II transcription apparatus. In this case, the growth defects would be due to the synergistic effects of inhibiting transcription at two possibly related points. We feel that the data presented here are better explained by the latter model for the following reasons. First, the genetic interactions observed with the Ras/PKA pathway were limited to mutations affecting particular aspects of RNA pol II transcription; not all mutations affecting RNA pol II transcription were influenced by Ras signaling activity. In fact, many of the mutations that did not exhibit a synthetic lethal interaction with RAS2Val19 result in a much more severe defect in transcription than do the Rpb1p CTD truncations. Second, increasing the levels of Ras/PKA signaling resulted in phenotypes reminiscent of those associated with a loss of CTD function and vice versa. Third, decreased signaling through the Ras/PKA pathway suppressed the growth defects associated with kin28 and tfa1 mutants. Both Kin28p and Tfa1p affect RNA pol II transcription, in part, by regulating the phosphorylation of the Rpb1p CTD (46Hampsey M. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 465-503Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fourth, not all of the srb mutations suppressed the RAS2Val19 rpb1-104 synthetic lethality. All of these srb mutations suppress the growth defects associated with CTD truncations, and the first model would predict that these srb mutations would suppress the double mutant lethality as well. Altogether, these data suggest that the RAS2Val19 lethality observed here is not merely the simple sum of a defect in transcription coupled with a defect in some other unrelated process important for cell growth. Instead, the data appear to support a model where Ras/PKA activity targets proteins important for RNA pol II transcription.Clearly, one of the main priorities for future work will be the identification of the PKA substrate responsible for the genetic effects characterized in this study. Previous work with the yeast and mammalian PKA enzymes has identified a consensus target site of RR X(S/T)B, where X indicates any amino acid and B refers to those amino acids with a hydrophobic side chain (72Denis C.L. Kemp B.E. Zoller M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17932-17935Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 73Taylor S.S. Zheng J. Radzio-Andzelm E. Knighton D.R. Ten Eyck L.F. Sowadski J.M. Herberg F.W. Yonemoto W.M. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond-Biol. Sci. 1993; 340: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, there are few candidate proteins within the RNA pol II transcription apparatus that contain a perfect match to this consensus. One of the best potential sites we identified was an RRRSS sequence present within the Mediator protein, Med1p (74Balciunas D. Galman C. Ronne H. Bjorklund S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 376-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, our analysis of Med1p has indicated that this protein is not the PKA target responsible for the genetic interactions observed in this study. 2S. C. Howard and P. K. Herman, unpublished observations. This inability to identify the PKA substrate by sequence comparison is not altogether surprising. One of the primary difficulties encountered during the study of protein kinases is the variation typically found in the target sites that are phosphorylated (75Kemp B.E. Parker M.W., Hu, S. Tiganis T. House C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 440-444Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Therefore, the relevant PKA target could possess a phosphorylation site that varies enough from the consensus that it would be rather difficult to recognize a priori. As a result, we are presently carrying out more classical genetic approaches that do not require any prior knowledge of the nature of the PKA target. One example of such a strategy is a genetic screen that aims to identify mutations that suppress the synthetic lethality of the rpb1-104 RAS2Val19 double mutant. Such genetic approaches should allow us to identify the PKA substrate responsible for the Ras effects on RNA pol II transcription that are described in this study.In all, the data presented here suggest that the Ras/PKA pathway is negatively regulating proteins that function through the Rpb1p CTD. At first glance, this might appear to be counterintuitive as both Ras/PKA activity and the CTD are essential for yeast cell growth. However, a possible explanation is suggested by studies of rpb1 alleles that encode proteins with a truncated CTD. These rpb1 mutants, like rpb1-104, exhibit defects in expression from a distinct set of genes; the transcription from many, and perhaps most, promoters is apparently unaffected by the shortening of the CTD (58Scafe C. Chao D. Lopes J. Hirsch J.P. Henry S. Young R.A. Nature. 1990; 347: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar,76Meisels E. Gileadi O. Corden J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31255-31261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This result indicates that particular genes require more CTD activity for their normal levels of expression. Therefore, the Ras pathway could affect the expression of specific sets of genes by down-regulating the activities of proteins associated with the Rpb1p CTD. Because Ras signaling is generally thought to serve as an indicator of environmental growth conditions (4Broach J.R. Trends Genet. 1991; 7: 28-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 9Thevelein J.M. de Winde J.H. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 904-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar, 38Herman P.K. Rine J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6171-6181Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), the affected genes should include those that would be preferentially expressed under conditions that are less than ideal for yeast cell growth. Clearly, this correlation holds for most of the genes examined in this study. In wild-type cells, the effects of the Ras pathway would presumably not be able to significantly dampen the expression of those genes required for growth. However, compromising the RNA pol II machinery by a second mutation could cause RAS2Val19 to limit expression from essential genes and thus result in the synthetic lethality observed in this study.The possibility that the Ras/PKA pathway could be regulating gene expression by targeting components within the RNA pol II holoenzyme is especially intriguing. Although no definitive examples have yet been described, the possibility of this type of a control mechanism has been alluded to in a number of previous studies (12Chang Y.W. Howard S.C. Budovskaya Y.V. Rine J. Herman P.K. Genetics. 2001; 157: 17-26PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kuchin S. Treich I. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In essence, this model suggests that in addition to targeting DNA-bound transcriptional regulators, signaling pathways might also regulate the activities of components within the RNA pol II holoenzyme (Fig. 7 B). In this manner, signal transduction pathways would be able to control transcription from a large number of promoters in a single regulatory step. This type of an approach would be an efficient and parsimonious way to bring about coordinated changes in the patterns of gene expression. Indeed, this type of a mechanism might be used by the Snf1p protein kinase. Snf1p has been shown to associate physically with the RNA pol II holoenzyme and thereby elicit a significant change in the yeast transcriptosome (17Kuchin S. Treich I. Carlson M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 7916-7920Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In addition, the holoenzyme proteins, Srb9p, Srb10p, and Srb11p, are likely targets of a signal transduction pathway responsible for coordinating yeast cell growth with nutrient availability (12Chang Y.W. Howard S.C. Budovskaya Y.V. Rine J. Herman P.K. Genetics. 2001; 157: 17-26PubMed Google Scholar, 77Holstege F.C. Jennings E.G. Wyrick J.J. Lee T.I. Hengartner C.J. Green M.R. Golub T.R. Lander E.S.

Finally, the data presented in this report suggest that the Ras/PKA signaling pathway influences RNA pol II transcription by modulating activities associated with the Rpb1p CTD. Further studies will be necessary to ascertain whether this type of a regulatory mechanism is indeed used to control gene expression in eukaryotic cells. The RAS genes encode small GTP-binding proteins that play an important role in regulating cell proliferation in many eukaryotes (1Shields J.M. Pruitt K. McFall A. Shaub A. Der C.J.

However, despite the obvious importance of this signaling pathway, only a few PKA substrates important for the control of yeast cell growth have been identified (7Reinders A. Burckert N. Boller T.

However, it is not yet known precisely how Ras activity influences the transcriptional apparatus. In S. cerevisiae, RNA polymerase (pol) II exists as a large holoenzyme complex that contains the 12-subunit polymerase, the Mediator co-activator complex, the Srb8-11 protein complex, and several general transcription factors (13Koleske A.J. Young R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 113-116Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). This holoenzyme is recruited to active promoters as a result of specific interactions between Mediator subunits and the DNA-bound transactivators present at these promoters (14Keaveney M. Struhl K. Mol. Cell. 1998; 1: 917-924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 15Ptashne M. Gann A. Nature. 1997; 386: 569-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (929) Google Scholar). Therefore, there are at least two potential targets for the Ras effects on RNA pol II activity as follows: the various transcription factors bound at the individual promoters, and the regulatory proteins associated with the RNA pol II holoenzyme. A number of studies already indicate that the Ras pathway regulates the activity of specific promoter-bound transcriptional regulators, like Msn2p and Msn4p (9Thevelein J.M. de Winde J.H. Mol.

Genetics. 2001; 159: 77-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have hinted at the possibility, there have been no reports of signaling pathways directly targeting components within the RNA pol II holoenzyme. Although RNA pol II transcription is controlled at multiple levels, it is clear that the C-terminal domain (CTD) of Rpb1p, the largest subunit of RNA pol II, is a key site of regulation. The Rpb1p CTD is a highly conserved, repetitive structure that is required for many aspects of mRNA production including pre-initiation complex formation, transcript elongation, and processing of the nascent transcript (20Greenleaf A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10896-10897Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar,21Hirose Y. Manley J.L. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1415-1429PubMed Google Scholar). In S. cerevisiae, the CTD consists of 26 or 27 repeats of the consensus heptamer, Tyr1-Ser2-Pro3-Thr4-Ser5-Pro6-Ser7(22Allison L.A. Moyle M. Shales M. Ingles C.J.

A. 1985; 82: 7934-7938Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). The CTD is phosphorylated by multiple protein kinases including Kin28p/Cdk7 in the general transcription factor, TFIIH, Srb10p/Cdk8 in the Srb complex, and Ctk1p/Cdk9 (24Carlson M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). These kinases are generally specific for either serine 2 or serine 5 of the individual repeats. Although all of the details are not yet understood, this phosphorylation clearly plays an important role in the regulation of CTD function (25Corden J.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 383-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 26Bentley D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 347-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). For example, the Mediator complex specifically associates with RNA pol II enzymes that contain a hypophosphorylated CTD (27Hengartner C.J. Myer V.E. Liao S.M. Wilson C.J. Koh S.S. Young R.A. Mol.

https://openalex.org/W2326641624,"The c-Cbl proto-oncogene acts as an E3 ubiquitin ligase via its RING finger domain to negatively regulate activated cellular signal transduction pathways. We have identified an aberrant Cbl-protein of approximately 95 kDa, which we have called p95Cbl, from the murine reticulum sarcoma cell-line, J-774. Cloning of the p95Cbl cDNA revealed that it contains a deletion resulting in the loss of 111 amino acids, eliminating two critical tyrosine residues in the linker region as well as the entire RING finger domain. p95Cbl displays a propensity for its interaction with the Src-family kinase Hck over cellular Cbl expressed in the same cells. Like its wildtype counterpart, p95Cbl is inducibly tyrosine phosphorylated in response to Fcgamma receptor engagement on hematopoietic cells, however this phosphorylation is sustained beyond that of cellular Cbl. NIH3T3 fibroblasts stably expressing p95Cbl acquire the typical refractile morphology associated with cellular transformation and form colonies in a focus-formation assay. The exogenously expressed mutant protein is constitutively phosphorylated in fibroblasts and partitions into the particulate fraction of cells, while cellular Cbl is exclusively cytoplasmic. p95Cbl is a novel, oncogenic mutant of the c-Cbl proto-oncogene, which might act in a dominant negative fashion to prolong normal cellular signaling responses by interfering with the down-regulation of activated signaling complexes through c-Cbl."
https://openalex.org/W1985466341,"Human prostatic acid phosphatase (PAcP) is a prostate epithelium-specific differentiation antigen. The cellular form of PAcP functions as a neutral protein-tyrosine phosphatase, and is involved in regulating prostate cell growth. Although some information on the PAcP gene structure has been obtained, little is known regarding the cis- and trans-acting factors that regulate its expression. Due to the biological importance of PAcP, we investigated the regulation of its expression. A region upstream of the PAcP gene from -2899 to +87 base pairs was linked to the coding sequence of the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene. Sequential deletions of the sequence between -2899 and -205 revealed that, in addition to the basic promoter, the region between -1258 and -779 represents a positive regulatory element. This -1258/-779 fragment could enhance the PAcP promoter activity in PC-3 and DU 145 human prostate cancer cells, but not in non-prostate cancer cells, including WI-38 lung diploid cells, A-431 epidermoid carcinoma cells, and HeLa cervix epitheloid carcinoma cells. Furthermore, this cis-element together with the promoter sequence could drive a high level of expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in PC-3 cells, but not in HeLa cells. The prostate-specific expression was further examined by injecting naked plasmid DNA into the prostate and the hamstring muscle of mice. The fluorescence pattern clearly showed that the level of GFP expression is consistently higher in prostate cells than in muscle cells of the intact animal. The data collectively indicate that region between -1258 and -779 is involved in governing the cell type-specific expression of the PAcP gene."
https://openalex.org/W2331667370,"We had previously shown that murine macrophages expressing v-Fes, the oncogenically activated counterpart of the c-Fes cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase, proliferate independently of Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor (MCSF) and that the Extracellular signal-Regulated Kinase (ERK) pathway mediates the mitogenic effect of v-Fes. In this study, the response of c-fes- and v-fes-overexpressing cells to MCSF was investigated. A critical modulation of the activation of Mitogen-activated ERK Kinase (MEK) and ERK based on the MCSF dose was characterized. ERK activation was increased by MCSF doses capable to elicit a mitogenic response (2-5 U/ml). On the contrary, MCSF doses as low as 0.05 U/ml markedly reduced ERK phosphorylation and nuclear content and moderately but significantly reduced cell proliferation. The reduction of MEK and ERK phosphorylation was very rapid, suggesting the involvement of cytosolic phosphatases. Among these, phospho-tyrosine protein phosphatases and phosphoserine/threonine protein phosphatase-2A were found involved. These findings represent the first observation that different doses of the same growth factor, MCSF in particular, can exert opposite effects on cell proliferation by switching on or off ERK signaling."

The experiments in this article were designed to explore the molecular basis for this differential cell type- and gene-specific regulation. The results highlight the influence of three variables, namely promoter context, AP-1 flanking sequence, and accessory elements that modulate insulin and phorbol ester signaling through the AP-1 motif. Thus, fusion gene transfection and proteolytic clipping gel retardation assays suggest that the AP-1 flanking sequence affects the conformation of AP-1 binding to the collagenase-1 and ME AP-1 motifs such that it selectively binds the latter in a fully activated state. However, this influence of ME AP-1 flanking sequence is dependent on promoter context. Thus, the ME AP-1 motif will mediate both an insulin and phorbol ester response in HeLa cells when introduced into either the collagenase-1 promoter or a specific heterologous promoter.

A Fundamental and Clinical Text. 2nd Ed. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia2000: 291-305Google Scholar). The stimulatory and inhibitory effects of insulin on gene transcription are mediated through various cis-acting elements collectively referred to as insulin response sequences or elements (IRSs/IREs).1 Unlike cAMP, which regulates gene transcription predominantly through onecis-acting element (3Daniel P.B. Walker W.H. Habener J.F. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1998; 18: 353-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar), a single consensus IRS does not exist. Instead, six, distinct consensus IRSs have currently been well defined (2O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus. A Fundamental and Clinical Text. 2nd Ed. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia2000: 291-305Google Scholar) in addition to several IRSs that appear to be unique to individual genes (1O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Thus, this situation resembles that for phorbol esters, which are able to regulate gene transcription through at least eight distinct consensus sequences (4Rahmsdorf H.J. Herrlich P. Pharmacol. Ther. 1990; 48: 157-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). One of these consensus IRSs has the sequence T(G/A)TTT(T/G)(G/T) and mediates the inhibitory effect of insulin on phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1, apolipoprotein CIII, and glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit gene transcription (1O'Brien R.M.

The transcription factor FKHR binds this IRS but whether it mediates the action of insulin through this motif is unclear (5Durham S.K. Suwanichkul A. Scheimann A.O. Yee D. Jackson J.G. Barr F.G.

They are the activator protein-1 (AP-1) motif, the serum response element (SRE), the Ets motif, the thyroid transcription factor-2 motif, and the sterol response element-binding protein (SREBP) motif (1O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1109-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 2O'Brien R.M. Granner D.K. LeRoith D. Taylor S.I. Olefsky J.M. Diabetes Mellitus. A Fundamental and Clinical Text. 2nd Ed. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia2000: 291-305Google Scholar). Multiple hormones other than insulin regulate gene expression through the AP-1 motif, the SRE, and the Ets motif (8Karin M. Liu Z. Zandi E. Curr. Opin.

Insulin and thyrotropin, the latter acting through cAMP, both stimulate the expression of thyroid transcription factor-2 (11Ortiz L. Zannini M., Di Lauro R. Santisteban P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23334-23339Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), which contributes to the induction of thyroglobulin and thyroperoxidase gene transcription by these hormones (1O'Brien R.M.

A Fundamental and Clinical Text. 2nd Ed. Lippincott-Raven, Philadelphia2000: 291-305Google Scholar). Similarly, insulin and cAMP both regulate the expression of SREBP-1c, although in this case their effects are antagonistic (13Foretz M. Pacot C. Dugail I. Lemarchand P. Guichard C., Le Liepvre X.

The mechanism of insulin signaling through the AP-1 motif is poorly understood but appears to involve effects of insulin on both the phosphorylation state and mass of the AP-1 complex (1O'Brien R.M.

The orientation and number of inserts in the TKCAT, TKC-VI, and XMB plasmid constructs were determined by restriction enzyme analysis and confirmed by DNA sequencing.Table ISequence of oligonucleotides used in these studiesAll nucleotide positions are negative and are numbered relative to the transcription start site at +1.

The resulting construct, designated Coll 158:ME (Fig. 8), was generated within the context of the −158 to +64 collagenase promoter fragment. Briefly, two complementary PCR primers were designed; the sequence of the sense strand oligonucleotide was as follows (mutated nucleotides are underlined): 5′-CAAGAGGATGTTATCCGCCG TGAGTCA GCGAGCCTCTGGCTTTC-3′. The AP-1 core sequence was unchanged and is shown in italics. This sense strand oligonucleotide was used in conjunction with a 3′ PCR primer to generate the 3′-half of the collagenase promoter, whereas the complementary antisense strand oligonucleotide was used in conjunction with a 5′ PCR primer to generate the 5′-half of the collagenase promoter. These 5′ and 3′ primers were designed to maintain the 5′ and 3′ junctions of the collagenase promoter fragments to be the same as that in the wild-type −158 to +64 collagenase-CAT fusion gene construct. The PCR products from these two reactions were then combined and used themselves as both primer and template in a second PCR reaction to generate a small amount of the full-length, mutated collagenase promoter fragment. Finally, the 5′ and 3′ PCR primers were then used to amplify this fragment. An identical strategy was used to generate a promoter fragment in which the orientation of the ME AP-1 motif in the context of the Coll 158:ME construct was switched by changing the core sequence from TGAGTCA to TGACTCA. Truncated constructs, designated Coll 79 and Coll 79:ME (Fig. 8), were then generated using the same 3′ PCR primer described above and the following 5′ PCR primers, respectively: 5′-CCGCTCGAGAAAGCATGAGTCAGACAG-3′; 5′-CCGCTCGAGCCGCCGTGACTCAGCGAGCCTCTGGCTTTCTGG-3′ (AP-1 core sequences are shown in italics and XhoI cloning sites are underlined). All promoter fragments were completely sequenced to ensure the absence of polymerase errors and plasmids were purified by centrifugation through cesium chloride gradients (27Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis E.F. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Rat H4IIE hepatoma cells were grown to 40–70% confluence in T150 flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 2.5% (v/v) fetal calf serum and 2.5% (v/v) newborn calf serum and were transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation method as previously described (16Streeper R.S.

Transfected cells were incubated for 20 h in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium prior to harvesting. Human HeLa cervical carcinoma cells were grown to 90% confluence in T150 flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) calf serum and were replated the day before use into 55-cm2 culture dishes. Attached cells were then transiently transfected using the calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation method as previously described (16Streeper R.S. Chapman S.C. Ayala J.E. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. Cave A. O'Brien R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In some experiments (Figs. 6 and 8) the reporter gene construct (15 μg) and an expression vector for β-galactosidase (2.5 μg) were co-transfected with an expression vector encoding the insulin receptor (5 μg), courtesy of Dr. Jonathan Whittaker. After an overnight incubation the medium was replaced with serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented, where indicated in the figure legends, with or without 100 nm PMA or 100 nm insulin. The cells were then incubated for a further 20 h prior to harvesting. For the analysis of basal gene expression, three independent preparations of each plasmid construct were analyzed in duplicate. Transfected HeLa and H4IIE cells were harvested by trypsin digestion and then sonicated in 300 μl of 250 mm Tris (pH 7.8) containing 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The HeLa cell lysate was assayed for β-galactosidase activity as previously described (16Streeper R.S. Chapman S.C. Ayala J.E. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. Cave A. O'Brien R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The remaining HeLa cell lysate and the H4IIE lysate were heated for 10 min at 65 °C and cellular debris was removed by centrifugation. CAT assays were then performed on the supernatant as previously described (16Streeper R.S. Chapman S.C. Ayala J.E. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. Cave A. O'Brien R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To correct for variations in HeLa cell transfection efficiency, the results were expressed as the ratio of CAT:β-galactosidase activity. In earlier studies we had found that phorbol esters and insulin stimulated Rous sarcoma virus-β-galactosidase expression in HeLa cells (16Streeper R.S. Chapman S.C. Ayala J.E. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. Cave A. O'Brien R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) but that was not apparent in this series of experiments. To correct for variations in H4IIE cell transfection efficiency, CAT activity was corrected for the protein concentration in the cell lysate, as measured by the Pierce BCA assay. To study AP-1 binding, the preparation of HeLa cell nuclear extracts, the labeling of double-stranded oligonucleotide probes, and gel retardation assays were performed under conditions exactly as previously described (16Streeper R.S.

DNA (NY). 1988; 7: 47-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Gel retardation competition experiments and partial proteolytic clipping bandshift assays were also performed as previously described (16Streeper R.S. Chapman S.C. Ayala J.E. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. Cave A. O'Brien R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that insulin stimulates collagenase-CAT and ME-CAT fusion gene expression in H4IIE cells but insulin only stimulates collagenase-CAT and not ME-CAT fusion gene expression in HeLa cells (16Streeper R.S. Chapman S.C. Ayala J.E. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. Cave A. O'Brien R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 17Chapman S.C. Ayala J.E. Streeper R.S. Culbert A.A. Eaton E.M. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. Tavare J.M. O'Brien R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 18625-18634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In addition, we found that phorbol esters stimulate collagenase-CAT but not ME-CAT fusion gene expression in HeLa cells (16Streeper R.S. Chapman S.C. Ayala J.E. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. Cave A. O'Brien R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). We previously suggested that these results may be explained, in part, by the observation that the ME and collagenase AP-1 motifs are functionally distinct (16Streeper R.S. Chapman S.C. Ayala J.E. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. Cave A. O'Brien R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, transient transfection experiments in HeLa cells using heterologous TKCAT fusion genes showed that AP-1 binds the ME AP-1 motif, but not the collagenase AP-1 motif, in an activated state. As a consequence, only the collagenase AP-1 motif confers an additional stimulatory effect of phorbol esters on the expression of a heterologous TKCAT fusion gene (16Streeper R.S. Chapman S.C. Ayala J.E. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. Cave A. O'Brien R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In these experiments multiple copies of a double stranded oligonucleotide representing the ME AP-1 motif were ligated into the polylinker of a heterologous TKCAT fusion gene and this resulted in a marked increase in basal fusion gene expression, relative to that obtained with the basic TKCAT vector alone (16Streeper R.S. Chapman S.C. Ayala J.E. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. Cave A. O'Brien R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). This marked increase in basal fusion gene expression was selectively seen with the ME AP-1 motif because ligation of multiple copies of a double stranded oligonucleotide representing the collagenase AP-1 motif into the TKCAT polylinker resulted in only a small increase in basal fusion gene expression (16Streeper R.S. Chapman S.C. Ayala J.E. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. Cave A. O'Brien R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In contrast, when multiple copies of a double stranded oligonucleotide representing a mutated ME AP-1 motif, which fails to bind AP-1 in gel retardation assays, were ligated into the TKCAT polylinker there was no increase in basal fusion gene expression, relative to that obtained with the basic TKCAT vector alone (16Streeper R.S. Chapman S.C. Ayala J.E. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. Cave A. O'Brien R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). To extend these observations, we first determined whether the marked stimulation of basal fusion gene expression by the ME AP-1 motif was specific to the context of the heterologous TKCAT fusion gene. Therefore, experiments similar to those described above were repeated using a different heterologous fusion gene, designated TKC-VI (24Sudhof T.C. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1987; 48: 1061-1069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The TKCAT vector contains the herpes simplex virus TK promoter sequence from −105 to +51 ligated to the CAT reporter gene and has a uniqueBamHI site in the polylinker at −105 (23Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar). By contrast, the TKC-VI plasmid contains the herpes simplex virus-TK promoter sequence from −480 to +51 ligated to the CAT gene and has a uniqueBamHI linker between positions −40 and −35 (24Sudhof T.C. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1987; 48: 1061-1069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Various double stranded oligonucleotides representing distinct regions of the ME or collagenase promoters (Table I) were synthesized with BamHI compatible ends and were ligated as single copies, in the same orientation as that found in the endogenous ME and collagenase promoters, into BamHI-cleaved TKC-VI. Typically, a maximal oligonucleotide size of 42 bp can be cloned into the BamHI site of the TKC-VI vector without losing basal reporter gene expression (24Sudhof T.C. Russell D.W. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1987; 48: 1061-1069Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), therefore, multimerized AP-1 motifs were not analyzed in this vector context. The level of reporter gene expression directed by the resulting constructs was then analyzed by transient transfection of HeLa cells (Fig.1 A). Oligonucleotides representing the ME promoter sequence between −161 and −123, between −138 and −101, and between −138 and −123, all of which contain the ME AP-1 motif (Table I), all conferred a marked increase in basal fusion gene expression, relative to that obtained with the basic TKC-VI vector alone (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, the oligonucleotide representing the collagenase AP-1 motif did not confer an increase in basal fusion gene expression (Fig.1 A). This result indicates that the activation of basal fusion gene expression by the ME AP-1 motif was not specific to the context of the TKCAT vector and, in addition, demonstrates that this effect does not require multimerization of the ME AP-1 motif. This result also raises the possibility that the slight activation of basal fusion gene expression by the collagenase AP-1 motif in the context of the TKCAT vector (16Streeper R.S. Chapman S.C. Ayala J.E. Svitek C.A. Goldman J.K. Cave A. O'Brien R.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 1778-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) may require the multimerization of this motif. Next, to determine whether the activation of basal fusion gene expression by the ME AP-1 motif was specific to HeLa cells, the plasmid constructs described above were transiently transfected into rat hepatoma H4IIE cells. As shown in Fig. 1 B, similar results were also obtained in the H4IIE cell line. Thus, the ME AP-1 motif, but not the collagenase AP-1 motif, again stimulated a marked increase in basal fusion gene expression, relative to that obtained with the basic TKC-VI vector alone. Interestingly, an oligonucleotide representing the ME promoter sequence between −181 and −145, which contains overlapping Egr-1 and Sp protein-binding sites (Table I), only conferred an increase in basal"
https://openalex.org/W2333737352,"The E2F1 transcription factor plays a pivotal role in driving cells out of a quiescent state and into the S phase of the cell cycle, in part by transactivating genes needed for DNA replication including DHFR, thymidine kinase, and DNA Polymerase α. E2F1 has also been implicated in regulating an S phase checkpoint, however its role in this checkpoint is not well defined. To determine how E2F1 affects such a checkpoint, we utilized an in vivo replication assay employing a plasmid based SV40 origin of replication, transfected into cells expressing SV40 large T antigen. Here we show that expression of full length E2F1, or only its N terminus, represses replication from plasmids containing the SV40 origin, while N terminal deletions of E2F1 do not. E2F1 appears to inhibit the elongation phase of replication and not the initiation phase since it does not affect the replication of other cotransfected plasmids containing only the SV40 origin. Further, inhibition of replication is dependent on both the amino-terminus of the E2F1 protein and on a DNA sequence that is contained within the 3′ end of the E2F1 cDNA. Additionally, both full-length E2F1, or just its N-terminus, form protein complexes with two portions of the 3′ end of the E2F1 cDNA. These data provide a clue to the mechanism by which E2F1 regulates transit through the S phase checkpoint, by acting on a specific DNA sequence via its amino-terminal region, to inhibit elongation of DNA replication."
