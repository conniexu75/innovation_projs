https://openalex.org/W2066013459,"The controlled manipulation of silicon at the nanometer scale will facilitate the fabrication of new types of electronic devices. The scanning tunneling microscope (STM) can be used to manipulate strongly bound silicon atoms or clusters at room temperature. Specifically, by using a combination of electrostatic and chemical forces, surface atoms can be removed and deposited on the STM tip. The tip can then move to a predetermined surface site, and the atom or cluster can be redeposited. The magnitude of such forces and the amount of material removed can be controlled by applying voltage pulses at different tip-surface separations."
https://openalex.org/W2092041921,"The Siberian Traps represent one of the most voluminous flood basalt provinces on Earth. Laser-heating (40)Ar/(39)Ar data indicate that the bulk of these basalts was erupted over an extremely short time interval (900,000 +/- 800,000 years) beginning at about 248 million years ago at mean eruption rates of greater than 1.3 cubic kilometers per year. Such rates are consistent with a mantle plume origin. Magmatism was not associated with significant lithospheric rifting; thus, mantle decompression resulting from rifting was probably not the primary cause of widespread melting. Inception of Siberian Traps volcanism coincided (within uncertainty) with a profound faunal mass extinction at the Permo-Triassic boundary 249 +/- 4 million years ago; these data thus leave open the question of a genetic relation between the two events."
https://openalex.org/W2084150760,"Atomic force microscopy and x-ray diffractometry were used to study 1500 A-thick films of pure C(60) grown by sublimation in ultrahigh vacuum onto a CaF(2) (111) substrate. Topographs of the films did not reveal the expected close-packed structures, but they showed instead large regions that correspond to a face-centered cubic (311) surface and distortions of this surface. The open (311) structure may have a relatively low free energy because the low packing density contributes to a high entropy of the exposed surface."
https://openalex.org/W2107393392,"Globally coherent oscillation modes were discovered in the sun about a decade ago, providing a unique seismological probe of the solar interior. Current observations detect modes that are phase-coherent for up to 1 year, with surface velocity amplitudes as low as 2 millimeters per second, and thousands of mode frequencies have been measured to accuracies as high as 1 part in 10(5). This article discusses the properties of these oscillation modes and the ways in which they are adding to our understanding of the structure and dynamics of the sun."
https://openalex.org/W2031059833,"The new mineral NaCrSi(2)0(6) (ureyite) has been found as rareemeraldgreen grains in the iron meteorites Coahuila, Toluca, and Hex River Mountains. X-ray studies of the natural and synthetic material have established that the mineral is isostructural with jadeite, NaAlSi(2)0(6). Indexed data for powder patterns obtained by x-ray diffraction and precise cell dimensions are given for the Cr, Fe, and Al members of the jadeite group. Unlike jadeite, a high-pressure phase, ureyite can be synthesized from melts at 1-atmosphere pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2024533124,"Geologic reasons indicate that the dominant position of the Middle East as a source of conventional petroleum will not be changed by new discoveries elsewhere. The share of world crude oil production coming from the Middle East could increase, within 10 to 20 years, to exceed 50 percent, under even modest increases in world consumption. Nonconventional resources of oil exist in large quantities, but because of their low production rates they can at best only mitigate extant trends. Increased production of natural gas outside the United States, however, offers an opportunity for geographically diversified energy supplies in the near future."

https://openalex.org/W1965726766,"Changes in planktonic microfossil assemblages in Atlantic and Pacific sediment cores of Late Cenozoic age correspond in a general way with a horizon recognized in neritic sediments of the northern Gulf of Mexico. Geological evidence from the Gulf Coast indicates that the changes occurred near theend of the Aftonian interglaciation of the early Pleistocene rather than atthe end of the Pliocene, as proposed by other investilgators."

https://openalex.org/W2008969882,"A north-south subbottom acoustic profile made in the central Pacific Ocean shows that the first layer (unconsolidated and semiconsolidated sediments) increases in thickness from less than 200 meters at about 14 degrees N to more than 600 meters near the equator. Two major faults, one of which lies on the extension of the Clipperton fracture zone, have produced vertical separations of about 400 meters in the base of the first layer."
https://openalex.org/W1982415188,Prismatic slip occurs in polycrystalline titanium diboride after applying 5 to 15 kilobars of hydrostatic pressure. Specimens were subjected to these pressures inside silver chloride matrices by means of a simple cylindrical piston device. The slip was of the type {1010} <1120>. Microhardness indentations produced similar results.
