https://openalex.org/W2010649076,"Tens of millions of short peptides can be easily surveyed for tight binding to an antibody, receptor or other binding protein using an ""epitope library."" The library is a vast mixture of filamentous phage clones, each displaying one peptide sequence on the virion surface. The survey is accomplished by using the binding protein to affinity-purify phage that display tight-binding peptides and propagating the purified phage in Escherichia coli. The amino acid sequences of the peptides displayed on the phage are then determined by sequencing the corresponding coding region in the viral DNA's. Potential applications of the epitope library include investigation of the specificity of antibodies and discovery of mimetic drug candidates."
https://openalex.org/W1973365703,"We have examined the interaction between the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor and three src family tyrosine kinases, pp60c-src, p59fyn, and pp62c-yes. The kinase activities of all three enzymes were elevated after PDGF stimulation of quiescent fibroblasts, coincident with association of the src family kinases with the PDGF receptor and other proteins. The presence of a protein of 81-85 kd in these complexes correlated with the detection of phosphatidylinositol (PI) kinase activity (previously described to associate with both the PDGF receptor and pp60c-src-middle T antigen). These results suggest that the physiological response to PDGF involves interaction of the receptor not only with serine/threonine and lipid kinases and a phospholipase, but also with other tyrosine kinases."

https://openalex.org/W1974527579,"We have examined individual GATC sites throughout the E. coli genome for their kinetics of remethylation by dam methyltransferase following the passage of the chromosomal replication fork. We present evidence for three major conclusions: that oriC is a single function unit that is specifically sequestered from dam methyltransferase for a significant period of time and then released; that the dnaA promoter region is subject to sequestration analogous to that observed at oriC and thus that hemimethylation-dependent sequestration is a general phenomenon; and that each round of replication initiation triggers a transient, temporally coordinate block in both reinitiation at oriC and expression of the dnaA gene. These and other observations are all consistent with the notion that hemimethylation in these two regions acts coordinately to ensure that every origin undergoes initiation once and only once per cell cycle; other possible roles for sequestration at dnaA are also considered."
https://openalex.org/W1562427827,"The present study was designed to determine if alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulation of neonatal rat myocardial cells might induce common and/or distinct members of the immediate early gene program and to assess whether their induction might correlate with the differential effects of these adrenergic agonists on cardiac gene expression, sarcomere assembly, and several features of myocardial cell hypertrophy. Alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulation of neonatal rat myocardial cells both produce an increase in the assembly of an individual contractile protein (myosin light chain-2) into organized sarcomeric units and also rapidly induce mRNAs for the immediate early genes c-fos and c-jun, thereby suggesting a potential role for these protooncogenes in sarcomerogenesis. alpha-Adrenergic stimulation results in the co-induction of mRNAs encoding a zinc finger protein gene (Egr-1). However, beta-adrenergic stimulation does not produce a significant increase in the levels of Egr-1 mRNA, providing the first evidence in any cell system that c-fos and Egr-1 expression can regulated separately. Studies with norepinephrine in combination with various adrenergic receptor antagonists revealed that the induction of Egr-1 is primarily an alpha 1-mediated, pertussis toxin-insensitive response. These studies provide the first evidence for the induction of immediate early genes following adrenergic stimulation of myocardial cells and demonstrate alpha- and beta-adrenergic stimulation can rapidly activate the expression of common and distinct subsets of these transcriptional regulators. Since alpha- and beta-adrenergic agonists have differential effects on cardiac gene expression and on the acquisition of several features of myocardial cell hypertrophy, the induction of Egr-1 provides a potential mechanism for the induction of genes that are exclusively induced during alpha-adrenergic-mediated myocardial cell hypertrophy."

https://openalex.org/W1564214284,"Immunological cross-reactivity between tumor necrosis factor (TNF) binding proteins which are present in human urine (designated TBPI and TBPII) and two molecular species of the cell surface receptors for TNF is demonstrated. The two TNF receptors are shown to be immunologically distinct, to differ in molecular weight (58,000 and 73,000), and to be expressed differentially in different cells. It is further shown that polyclonal antibodies against one of the TNF binding proteins (TBPI) display, by virtue of their ability to bind the TNF receptor, activities which are very similar to those of TNF. These antibodies are cytotoxic to cells which are sensitive to TNF toxicity, induce resistance to TNF toxicity, enhance the incorporation of thymidine into normal fibroblasts, inhibit the growth of chlamydiae, and induce the synthesis of prostaglandin E2. Monovalent F(ab) fragments of the polyclonal antibodies lack TNF-like activities, but acquire them upon cross-linking with anti-F(ab)2 antibodies, suggesting that the ability of the anti-TBPI antibodies to mimic TNF correlates with their ability to cross-link the TNF receptors. This notion was further supported by data obtained in a comparative study of the TNF-like cytotoxicity of a panel of monoclonal antibodies against TBPI. The induction of TNF-like effects by antibodies to a TNF receptor suggests that TNF is not directly involved in intracellular signalling. Rather, it is the receptors to this cytokine which, when properly triggered in a process which appears to involve clustering of these receptors, transduce the signal for response to TNF into the cell's interior."

https://openalex.org/W2080036688,"Ribonuclease P (RNase P) from Escherichia coli or its catalytic RNA subunit can efficiently cleave small RNA substrates that lack the conserved features of natural substrates of RNase P if an additional small RNA is also present. This additional RNA must contain a sequence complementary to the substrate [external guide sequence (EGS)] and a 3'-proximal CCA sequence to ensure cleavage. The aminoacyl acceptor stem and some additional 5'- and 3'-terminal sequences of a precursor transfer RNA are sufficient to allow efficient cleavage by RNAase P, and the 2'-hydroxyl group at the cleavage site is not absolutely necessary for cleavage. In principle, any RNA could be targeted by a custom-designed EGS RNA for specific cleavage by RNase P in vitro or in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1981634986,"The promoter region of the suprabasal keratin 10 gene has been used to direct expression of a mutant human Harvey-ras oncogene to the differentiating cells of the mouse epidermis. Transgenic animals develop hyperkeratosis of the skin and forestomach--the two sites known to express high levels of the keratin 10 polypeptide in vivo. Papillomas subsequently develop on the skin surface, initially at sites subject to biting or scratching such as the base of the tail or behind the ears. The results suggest that the ""second event"" involved in tumor development in these transgenic animals is the local induction of a mild wounding stimulus. Furthermore, because the H-ras transgene is expressed in suprabasal cells, it appears that cells which have left the stem cell compartment can be induced to form at least benign tumors in vivo."

https://openalex.org/W2055392956,"Neutrophils and monocytes, but not lymphocytes, adhered strongly to plastic surfaces coated with GMP140, a protein of endothelial cells and platelets. This adhesion of neutrophils was mediated by GMP140 and not by the CD18 integrin complex. By contrast, GMP140 in solution inhibited the CD18-dependent adhesion of tumor necrosis factor-α-activated neutrophils to plastic surfaces and resting endothelium, but not of resting neutrophils to tumor necrosis factor-α-activated endothelium. Thus, the binding of a soluble form of an adhesion protein selectively inhibited another set of adhesive events. Soluble GMP140 may be important in maintaining the nonadhesiveness of neutrophils in the circulation and may serve to limit inflammatory reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1578612512,"Interleukin-1 (IL-1 beta) increases the synthesis of both heavy and light (L)-ferritin subunits when added to human hepatoma cells (HepG2) grown in culture. RNase protection and Northern blot analysis with L-ferritin probes revealed that no changes in L-ferritin mRNA levels occur after cytokine stimulation. However, the induction coincides with an increased association of the L-subunit mRNA with polyribosomes. Since the recruitment of stored ferritin mRNA onto polyribosomes is seen when iron enters the cell, the effect of IL-1 beta on iron uptake was tested and was found to be unaffected by the lymphokine. Neither transferrin receptor mRNA levels nor the number of receptors displayed on the cell surface was affected by IL-1 beta. However, the action of the cytokine on ferritin translation is inhibited by the action of the intracellular iron chelator deferoxamine. These data indicate that IL-1 beta induces ferritin gene expression by translational control of its mRNA. The pathway of induction is different from iron-dependent ferritin gene expression whereas regulation requires the background presence of cellular iron."
https://openalex.org/W1484925335,"Previously proposed mechanisms for the production of L-citrulline from L-arginine by macrophage nitric oxide (NO.) synthase involve either hydrolysis of arginine or hydration of an intermediate and thus predict incorporation of water oxygen into L-citrulline. Macrophage NO. synthase was incubated with L-arginine, NADPH, tetrahydrobiopterin, FAD, and dithiothreitol in H2(18)/16O2. L-Citrulline produced in this reaction was analyzed with gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Its mass spectrum matched that of L-citrulline generated in H2(16)O/16O2. The base fragment ion of m/z 99 was shown to contain the ureido carbonyl group by using L-[guanidino-13C]arginine as substrate. When the enzyme reaction was performed in H2(16)O/18O2, the base fragment ion shifted to m/z 101 with L-[guanidino-12C]arginine as the substrate and to m/z 102 with L-[guanidino-13C]arginine. These results indicate that the ureido oxygen of the L-citrulline product of macrophage NO.synthase derives from dioxygen and not from water."
https://openalex.org/W2035722336,"A partial complementary DNA was isolated for a gene (rrg) that is normally expressed in mouse NIH 3T3 cells, but is down-regulated after cellular transformation by long terminal repeat (LTR)-activated c-H-ras (LTR-c-H-ras). This gene was reexpressed in a nontumorigenic persistent revertant cell line created by prolonged treatment of the transformed cells with mouse interferon α/β. Persistent revertants stably transfected with rrg complementary DNA antisense expression vectors appeared transformed, had decreased amounts of rrg messenger RNA, and were tumorigenic in nude mice. Stable transfection with sense constructs did not alter the normal morphology, message level, or nontumorigenicity of the persistent revertant cell line."
https://openalex.org/W2022987420,"The interaction of the T cell receptor for antigen (TCR) with its antigen-major histocompatibility complex ligand is difficult to study because both are cell surface multimers. The TCR consists of two chains (alpha and beta) that are complexed to the five or more nonpolymorphic CD3 polypeptides. A soluble form of the TCR was engineered by replacing the carboxyl termini of alpha and beta with signal sequences from lipid-linked proteins, making them susceptible to enzymatic cleavage. In this manner, TCR heterodimers can be expressed independently of the CD3 polypeptides and in significant quantities (0.5 milligram per week). This technique seems generalizable to biochemical and structural studies of many other cell surface molecules as well."
https://openalex.org/W1975279384,Spontaneous intestinal and intra-abdominal bleeding was observed in a high percentage of newborn transgenic mice carrying the murine urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) gene linked to the albumin enhancer/promoter. These hermorrhagic events were directly related to transgene expression in the liver and the development of high plasma uPA levels. Two lines were established from surviving founder mice that displayed multigenerational transmission of the bleeding phenotype. Fatal hemorrhaging developed between 3 and 84 hr after birth in about half of the transgenic offspring of these lines; transgenic pups that did not bleed nevertheless passed the phenotype to their young. The phenotypic variability could not be explained by differences in transgene expression. All transgenic neonates were severely hypofibrinogenemic and displayed loss of clotting function that extended beyond the risk period for bleeding. These mice provide a means of studying the pathophysiology of plasminogen hyperactivation and evaluating therapeutic protocols designed to prevent bleeding.
https://openalex.org/W1550626564,"A bovine lung cGMP-binding phosphodiesterase (cG-BPDE) was purified to homogeneity and exhibited specific cGMP hydrolytic (Km = 5.6 microM) and cGMP binding (half-maximum approximately 0.2 microM) activities which comigrated throughout the purification. A chimeric structure was suggested for cG-BPDE since DEAE chromatography of a partial alpha-chymotryptic digest of cG-BPDE separated cGMP-binding fragments from a cGMP hydrolytic fragment. Native cG-BPDE (178 kDa) appeared to be a homodimer comprised of two 93-kDa subunits. The order of potency of inhibitors of cG-BPDE hydrolysis of cGMP was as follows: zaprinast greater than dipyridamole greater than 3-isobutyl-1-methyl-8-methoxymethylxanthine greater than 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine greater than cilostamide greater than theophylline greater than rolipram. Minimum [3H]cGMP binding stoichiometry was 0.93 mol of cGMP bound/mol of monomer, but [3H]cGMP dissociation from cG-BPDE in the presence of excess unlabeled cGMP was curvilinear, suggesting multiple cGMP-binding sites. Two chymotryptic cGMP-binding fragments of 35 and 45 kDa were specifically photoaffinity labeled with [32P] cGMP, exhibited [3H]cGMP association and dissociation behavior indistinguishable from native cG-BPDE, and each had the amino-terminal sequence: Thr-Ser-Pro-Arg-Phe-Asp-Asn-Asp-Glu-Gly-. Cochromatography of the two cGMP-binding fragments suggested that both a dimerization domain and a cGMP-binding domain were located in a 35-kDa segment of cG-BPDE. Increased [3H]cGMP binding to or [32P]cGMP photoaffinity labeling of cG-BPDE binding sites in the presence of hydrolytic site-specific cyclic nucleotide analogs suggested communication between hydrolytic and binding sites. The principle of reciprocity thus predicts that cGMP binding to the binding sites may affect the hydrolytic site. In the presence of cGMP, the binding fragments or native cG-BPDE exhibited an electronegative shift on high performance liquid chromatography-DEAE, consistent with a cGMP-induced change in cG-BPDE conformation."
https://openalex.org/W2076576008,"The interaction of a protein antigen, horse cytochrome c (cyt c), with a monoclonal antibody has been studied by hydrogen-deuterium (H-D) exchange labeling and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D NMR) methods. The H-exchange rate of residues in three discontiguous regions of the cyt c polypeptide backbone was slowed by factors up to 340-fold in the antibody-antigen complex compared with free cyt c. The protected residues, 36 to 38, 59, 60, 64 to 67, 100, and 101, and their hydrogen-bond acceptors, are brought together in the three-dimensional structure to form a contiguous, largely exposed protein surface with an area of about 750 square angstroms. The interaction site determined in this way is consistent with prior epitope mapping studies and includes several residues that were not previously identified. The hydrogen exchange labeling approach can be used to map binding sites on small proteins in antibody-antigen complexes and may be applicable to protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions in general."
https://openalex.org/W1605973129,"We have shown that the immunomodulating agent gliotoxin induces DNA fragmentation in macrophages characteristic of programmed cell death or apoptosis (Waring, P., Eichner, R. D., Mullbacher, A., and Sjaarda, A. (1988) J. Biol. Chem, 263, 18493-18499). In addition, morphological changes and DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis are induced in 48 h concanavalin A-stimulated T blasts by gliotoxin and these changes are inhibited by Zn2+ (Waring, P., Egan, M., Braithwaite, A., Mullbacher, A., and Sjaarda, A. (1990) Int. J. Immunopharmacol., in press). We have studied the effects of actinomycin D and the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide on apoptosis induced by gliotoxin in these cells, and these studies demonstrate no effect on apoptosis induced by gliotoxin. Cycloheximide and actinomycin D alone induce DNA fragmentation in these cells. Gliotoxin itself proved to be a potent inhibitor of protein synthesis. The fragmentation caused by cycloheximide correlated with the extent of protein synthesis inhibition. The toxin ricin also induced DNA fragmentation in T blasts characteristic of apoptosis. These results indicate that protein synthesis is not required for induction of apoptosis in macrophages or T blasts by gliotoxin. Gliotoxin caused elevated levels of inositol triphosphate in treated macrophages which may be related to mobilization of Ca2+ levels during apoptosis."
https://openalex.org/W1535282081,"A receptor for mouse granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been found on the cell surface of mouse myeloid leukemia cell line NFS-60. Chemical cross-linking of the receptor with radioiodinated G-CSF, followed by gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, has revealed that the G-CSF receptor in the NFS-60 cells is a single polypeptide of Mr approximately 100,000-130,000. The receptor in the membrane fraction of NFS-60 cells were solubilized in an active form with 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid. The solubilized receptor was purified approximately 100,000-fold to near homogeneity using a G-CSF affinity gel and gel filtration on a Superose 12 column, as measured by the selective precipitation of the 125I-G-CSF-receptor complex by polyethylene glycol. The purified G-CSF receptor has two classes of binding characteristics, one with an equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) of 120-360 pM which is comparable with the Kd value for the cell-surface receptor, and the other with a higher Kd value of 2.6-4.2 nM. Analyses of the purified receptor by ligand blotting and sucrose density gradient centrifugation indicated that the low-affinity receptor is the monomer of the Mr 100,000-130,000 protein, whereas the high-affinity receptor consists of oligomers of the protein."
https://openalex.org/W2050105563,"With retrovirus-mediated gene transfer, we used intact and deleted keratin proteins to investigate the molecular basis of intermediate filament function. Three levels of assembly show a different stringency for the involvement of individual keratin domains: protein accumulation requires the α helix domains; stable filament formation additionally requires both N- and C-terminal domains of either one of the two interacting keratins, suggesting that head to tail homotypic interaction is important for effective elongation; and higher order organization of the cytoplasmic network depends on correct type I-type II pairing of keratins. The presence of two distinct interaction sites along potentially different axes may explain the characteristic morphology of keratin intermediate filament networks."
https://openalex.org/W2035992732,"Transgenic mouse strains carrying proviruses were generated by exposing mouse embryos to a recombinant retrovirus. Animals carrying a single provirus were intercrossed to derive mice homozygous for a given proviral insertion. Adult mice homozygous for the Mpv17 integration developed nephrotic syndrome and chronic renal failure. Histologically, affected kidneys showed progressive glomerular sclerosis. Similar lesions are seen in patients with progressive renal function deterioration. A probe to DNA sequences flanking the provirus detected a 1.7 kb RNA ubiquitously expressed during embryogenesis and in adults with high levels in kidney, brain, and heart. This RNA was not detected in tissues of homozygous animals, suggesting that the provirus interferes with RNA expression. Sequence analysis of the cDNA revealed that the gene encodes a 176 amino acid peptide containing hydrophobic regions, suggesting membrane association of the putative protein. The Mpv17 mutant is a potentially useful experimental system for studying mechanisms leading to renal disorders in man."
https://openalex.org/W1589957034,"Serine protease inhibitors (serpins) are highly homologous proteins which inhibit selected target serine proteases by acting as a pseudo-substrate. Their specificity is primarily determined by the amino acid sequence around the carboxyl-terminally located reactive center (P1-P1'). In addition, the association rate constant between a serpin and a serine protease can be dramatically increased by non-protein cofactors, such as heparin in the case of thrombin inhibition by III. In an attempt to alter the specificity of PAI-1 from an inhibitor of the fibrinolytic system to an inhibitor of coagulation, we replaced P1-P1' or P3 through P3' of the reactive center of PAI-1 by the corresponding residues of III and assessed whether the mutant proteins, purified from lysates of transformed Escherichia coli cells, had acquired thrombin inhibitory properties. The experiments were performed in the presence and absence of vitronectin, a multifunctional protein which has been shown to bind PAI-1 in plasma and in the matrix of endothelial cells. The second-order rate constants for t-PA inhibition of PAI-1 and PAI P1-P1'ATIII, irrespective of the presence of vitronectin, were similar, whereas replacing P3-P3' resulted in a 40-fold decrease of the second-order rate constant towards t-PA, again independent of vitronectin. In the absence of vitronectin, reactivity of PAI-1 and its antithrombin III-like variants towards thrombin was slow; however, PAI-1 P3-P3' ATIII had a 10-fold higher k1 than wild-type PAI-1 (1.3 x 10(4) M-1 s-1 versus 1.1 x 10(3) M-1 s-1). In contrast, in the presence of vitronectin, PAI-1 and even more rapidly PAI-1 P3-P3'ATIII were found to be effective thrombin inhibitors, with k1 values of 2.2 x 10(5) M-1s-1 and 1.8 x 10(6) M-1 s-1, respectively. Thus, in the presence of vitronectin, PAI-1 P3-P3'ATIII displays a 3-fold higher k1 with thrombin than with t-PA. It is shown that vitronectin enhances, in a dose-dependent manner, the formation of sodium dodecyl sulfate-resistant complexes between PAI-1 or mutants thereof and thrombin. Therefore, vitronectin is the first protein described to function as a cofactor for serpin specificity. PAI-1 is proposed to be a versatile inhibitor which, in the presence of vitronectin, can modulate both coagulation and fibrinolysis."
https://openalex.org/W1491174528,"The effect of cadmium on the expression of oncogenes c-jun, c-fos, and c-myc was studied by exposing L6J1 myoblast cultures to different doses of cadmium chloride and then analyzing the abundance of oncogene transcripts. Cadmium induced a transient accumulation of c-jun and c-myc mRNA with maximum expression at 2-4 h. At the same time, the level of c-fos transcripts remained below the detection level. Both the c-fos and c-jun genes could. However, be induced by treating the myoblasts with insulin. Cadmium induction of c-jun and c-myc mRNA occurred in a concentration-dependent manner with maximum stimulation at 5-10 microM. In the presence of cycloheximide, c-jun and c-myc genes were superinduced by the addition of cadmium. Under these conditions there was also a marked increase in c-fos transcripts. Induction of c-myc and c-jun by cadmium and c-fos by a combination of cadmium and cycloheximide could be abolished by blocking transcription with actinomycin D. The cadmium-induced increase in c-jun and c-myc mRNA was enhanced in myoblasts stably transfected with a mouse c-fos gene under a metallothionein promoter. Our present data suggest that cadmium has the potential to deregulate the expression of several important oncogenes."
https://openalex.org/W1509239482,"Sucrose gradient and Northern analyses were used to study the translational status of endogenous multiple mRNAs encoding the prepropeptide for human insulin-like growth factor II. The results showed that a minor 4.8-kilobase mRNA was exclusively engaged in the synthesis of the prepropeptide on membrane-bound polysomes, whereas a major 6.0-kilobase mRNA was present in a cytoplasmic particle which was stable in EDTA. We conclude that the translational discrimination between the mRNAs is dictated by their different 5'-untranslated regions."
https://openalex.org/W2010815447,"There is currently a need for vaccine development to improve the immunogenicity of protective epitopes, which themselves are often poorly immunogenic. Although the immunogenicity of these epitopes can be enhanced by linking them to highly immunogenic carriers, such carriers derived from current vaccines have not proven to be generally effective. One reason may be related to epitope-specific suppression, in which prior vaccination with a protein can inhibit the antibody response to new epitopes linked to the protein. To circumvent such inhibition, a peptide from tetanus toxoid was identified that, when linked to a B cell epitope and injected into tetanus toxoid-primed recipients, retained sequences for carrier but not suppressor function. The antibody response to the B cell epitope was enhanced. This may be a general method for taking advantage of previous vaccinations in the development of new vaccines."
https://openalex.org/W1563552860,"NAD(+)-dependent 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase catalyzes the oxidation of many prostaglandins at C-15, resulting in a subsequent reduction in their biological activity. We report the isolation of the cDNA for this enzyme. A human placental lambda gt11 cDNA library was screened using polyclonal antibodies prepared against the human placental enzyme. A 2.5-kilobase cDNA containing the entire coding region for the enzyme was isolated. The cDNA encodes for a protein of 266 amino acids with a calculated Mr of 28,975. Identification of the cDNA as that coding for 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase was based on the comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence with the amino acid sequence of two peptides, one from the rabbit lung enzyme and the other from the human placental enzyme. This cDNA hybridizes with two species of poly(A+) RNA isolated from human placenta: one of 3.4 kilobases and the other of 2.0 kilobases. Isolation of the cDNA for 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase should facilitate studies on the structure, function, and regulation of this enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1588979255,"Myogenin is a member of the recently discovered family of muscle determination genes that have been shown to induce myogenic differentiation in nonmuscle cells and to be closely correlated with terminal differentiation in myoblasts. An antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide complementary to the first five codons of myogenin blocks the stimulation of terminal myogenic differentiation by insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I). This effect exhibits a high degree of specificity on two levels; exchanging the positions as few as 2 of the 15 bases in the oligomer abolishes its activity, and none of the other processes stimulated by IGF-I in L6A1 myoblasts are affected by the presence of the oligomer. These processes include cell proliferation as well as incorporation of leucine, uridine, and thymidine into macromolecules. The specificity, ease, and convenience of this approach indicates its potential applicability to studies on actions of other putative controlling genes in other systems."
https://openalex.org/W1522416880,"The full length cDNA coding for the alpha form of protein kinase C (PKC) was introduced into Swiss/3T3 cells using a retroviral expression system. This has enabled the generation of a series of cell lines stably expressing high levels of PKC alpha enzyme, as well as the appropriate control cell lines, carrying an integrated vector but lacking PKC alpha cDNA insert. PKC alpha-overexpressing cell lines did not display a transformed morphology nor were they capable of growth in soft agar. However, these cells exhibited enhanced growth rates especially under low serum conditions. Using Scatchard plot analysis of 125I-epidermal growth factor (EGF) binding to its receptor on the surface of PKC alpha-overproducing cells revealed reduction in EGF receptor numbers when compared to control cells, without change in affinities of remaining receptors. These data indicated that reduced receptor numbers for EGF were among the phenotypic changes occurring in these cells underlying their diminished dependence on external factors for growth. Furthermore, we provide evidence that reduced EGF receptor numbers found on the cell surface of PKC alpha-overproducing cells resulted from the decreased biosynthesis of EGF receptor molecules, which correlated also with lower levels of mRNA transcripts coding for the EGF receptor found in these cells. Hence, our studies imply that PKC alpha is involved in a cellular mechanism regulating the expression of EGF receptor molecules in Swiss/3T3 cells. Thus, deregulation of PKC alpha, i.e. by increasing its expression levels in specific cells may affect, in turn the expression of cell surface receptors including the EGF receptor. Similar molecular mechanisms may be involved in initial stages of neoplasia and tumor promotion."
https://openalex.org/W1594620664,"Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) is expressed at higher levels in many transformed cells as compared with their non-transformed counterparts. The transformed phenotype is associated with changes in the cytoskeleton. Therefore, we have investigated whether alterations in the cytoskeleton can trigger changes in the expression of the uPA gene. To this end we analyzed the expression of the uPA gene following exposure of porcine kidney cells, LLC-PK1, to agents that modify the organization of specific components of the cytoskeleton. These cells exhibited increased uPA mRNA and protein after disruption of microtubules by colchicine or nocodazole treatment or after disruption of microfilaments by cytochalasin B treatment. Colchicine, nocodazole, and cytochalasin B did not cause alterations in the level of cAMP-dependent protein kinase in LLC-PK1 cells. In contrast, down-regulation of protein kinase C by phorbol myristate acetate, reduced, but did not fully prevent the induction of uPA mRNA when LLC-PK1 cells were subsequently exposed to colchicine, nocodazole, or cytochalasin B. Apparently, a signal transduction pathway in part involving protein kinase C but not cAMP-protein kinase mediates the regulatory changes at the transcriptional level of the uPA gene. Inhibition of protein synthesis by cycloheximide prior to the exposure of LLC-PK1 cells to colchicine, nocodazole, or cytochalasin B, largely prevented the induction of uPA mRNA."
https://openalex.org/W1523219517,"Escherichia coli RNA polymerase pauses immediately after transcription of certain sequences that can form stable secondary structures in the nascent RNA transcript; pausing appears to be essential for several types of bacterial transcription attenuation mechanisms. Because base changes that weaken the RNA secondary structures reduce the half-life of pausing by RNA polymerase, nascent transcript RNA hairpins are thought to cause pausing at these sites. We show here that, for the well characterized trpL pause site, the determinants of transcription pausing are not limited to the RNA hairpin, but include the not-yet-transcribed sequence of DNA immediately downstream from the pause site. We show that this effect extends to bases up to fourteen nucleotides downstream from the pause site, that placement of a oligo(dT) tract in the nontranscribed strand in this region does not convert the pause site to a termination site, and that shifting the position of pausing by one nucleotide downstream almost eliminates pausing. From an analysis of many variants of this downstream sequence, we argue that the effect of downstream sequence is not related simply to its GC content. We suggest that these effects are mediated by altered interactions between RNA polymerase and the DNA template downstream from the enzyme's active site."
https://openalex.org/W1514294337,"The rates and equilibria of heme exchange between methemoglobin and serum albumin were measured using a simple new spectrophotometric method. It is based on the large difference between the spectrum of methemoglobin and that of methemealbumin at pH 8-9. The rate of heme exchange was found to be independent of the albumin concentration and inversely proportional to the hemoglobin (Hb) concentration. Taken together with the finding that the rate was 10 times greater for Hb Rothschild, which is completely dissociated into alpha beta dimers and 10 times smaller for two cross-linked hemoglobins, the subunits of which cannot dissociate, this showed that the rate of dissociation of heme from alpha beta dimers is very much greater than from tetramers. Conditions were found for the attainment of an equilibrium distribution of hemes between beta globin and albumin. The equilibrium distribution ratio, R = methemealbumin/albumin/methemoglobin/apohemoglobin, for hemoglobin A was 3.4 with human and 0.005 with bovine serum albumin. Both the rates of exchange and the R values of HbS and HbF were the same as that for HbA. The equilibrium distribution ratio for Hb Rothschild was 7 times greater than that for HbA whereas that of one but not the other of the cross-linked hemoglobins was 10 times smaller. The structural bases for these differences are analyzed."

https://openalex.org/W2045690615,"We have characterized a nondifferentiating mouse muscle cell line, NFB, that represses the activity of the helix-loop-helix (HLH) family of myogenic regulators, yet expresses sarcomeric actins. The NFB MyoD gene is silent, but can be activated upon transfection of a long terminal region-controlled chicken MyoD cDNA, resulting in myogenesis. When NFB cells are fused with H9c2 rat muscle cells in heterokaryons, the level of rat MyoD transcripts declines. Thus, the stoichiometry of MyoD and the putative repressor controls myogenesis. Although NFB cells express myogenin and Myf-5 transcripts, the activity of these regulators is also repressed: myogenesis is not induced in fibroblasts and is repressed in L6 muscle cells upon fusion with NFB cells. We conclude that the myogenic HLH regulators are not required for sarcomeric actin gene activation and that myogenesis is subject to dominant-negative control."
https://openalex.org/W1487740127,"alpha,alpha-Trehalase (EC 3.2.1.28), an intrinsic protein of intestinal brush-border membranes, was purified to homogeneity from rabbits. Partial amino acid sequences were determined. Two degenerate oligonucleotides based on the sequence of a CNBr peptide were employed in a polymerase chain reaction to amplify a 71-base pair fragment of trehalase DNA with rabbit intestine cDNA as a starting template. This fragment was used as a hybridization probe to isolate full length trehalase clones from a rabbit intestine cDNA bank. Sequence analysis revealed that trehalase comprises 578 amino acids, contains at the amino terminus a typical cleavable signal sequence, at the carboxyl terminus a rather hydrophobic region typical of proteins anchored via glycosylphosphatidylinositol, and four potential N-glycosylation sites. Trehalase has no sequence homologies with other sequenced brush-border glycosidases. Northern blot analysis revealed a 1.9-kilobase trehalase mRNA in small intestine and kidney, smaller amounts in liver, and none in lung. Southern blot analysis indicated the gene has a length of 20 kilobase pairs or less. Injection into Xenopus laevis oocytes of mRNA synthesized in vitro from a trehalase template resulted in the expression of trehalase activity several hundredfold above background. The trehalase activity was membrane-bound and could be solubilized upon digestion with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C from Bacillus thuringiensis. This strongly suggests that rabbit small intestinal trehalase is anchored via glycosylphosphatidylinositol also when expressed in X. laevis oocytes."
https://openalex.org/W1494735938,"To investigate mechanisms for processing of plant mitochondrial RNAs, we studied the fate of wheat mitochondrial tRNA precursors in a homologous soluble extract. Artificial precursor transcripts were synthesized in vitro using T3 or T7 RNA polymerase and DNA templates containing wheat mitochondrial tRNA genes and flanking sequences. We found that the mitochondrial extract supports processing of precursors containing both native and chloroplast-like (Joyce, P. B. M., and Gray, M. W. (1989) Nucleic Acids Res. 77, 5461-5476) wheat mitochondrial tRNA sequences. Incubation of precursor transcripts with the extract results in processing of tRNAs via precise 5'- and 3'-endonucleolytic cleavages. However, these cleavages are not ordered in vitro because intermediates composed of 5'-leader + tRNA and tRNA + 3'-trailer are present simultaneously throughout the course of the reaction. Sequence analysis of processed products confirmed that endonucleolytic cleavages occur at the expected positions, generating tRNAs with 5'-phosphoryl and 3'-hydroxyl termini. The mitochondrial extract also contains a tRNA nucleotidyltransferase activity that adds -CCAOH termini to the 3'-ends of processed tRNAs. This cell-free RNA processing system provides the basis for biochemical characterization of the various enzymes involved in the production and maturation of plant mitochondrial tRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W1509626830,"A single photon can be detected by a rod photoreceptor cell. The absorption of light by rhodopsin triggers a cascade of reactions that amplifies the photon signal and results in ion channel closure with hyperpolarization of the rod photoreceptor cell. Light-induced conformational changes in rhodopsin facilitate the binding of a guanosine nucleotide-binding protein, transducin, which then undergoes a GTP-GDP exchange reaction and dissociation of the transducin complex. A subunit of transducin then activates a phosphodiesterase complex that hydrolyzes cyclic GMP. In darkness, cyclic GMP binds to cation channels of the photoreceptor plasma membrane, maintaining them in an open configuration. The light-induced reduction in cyclic GMP concentration dissociates the bound cyclic GMP, resulting in channel closure and hyperpolarization. Down-regulation of the cascade involves other proteins that block the interaction of transducin with rhodopsin and another protein that may interfere with transducin recycling. Cone photoreceptors possess a light-activated cascade that follows the rod format, but it is composed of proteins that are homologous to those of rod photoreceptors. Phototransduction in invertebrate photoreceptors uses rhodopsin to activate a cascade that uses phosphoinositides and calcium ion to regulate membrane polarization."
https://openalex.org/W1527207562,"We have developed a model for characterizing calcium handling by the intact cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) that yields data consistent with both mathematical simulations of in situ SR Ca2+ uptake and deduced behavior of the Ca2(+)-induced Ca2+ efflux channels in mechanically skinned single cardiac cells. In Na(+)-based media (37 degrees C, pH 7.2, 50 mM Pi, 10 mM MgATP, pMg 3.3, 10 mM phosphocreatine), SR 45Ca2+ uptake by digitonin-lysed rat myocytes as a function of free [Ca2+] peaked at pCa 6.2, declined until pCa 5.6 and increased again at lower pCa. When Ca2(+)-induced Ca2+ efflux was inhibited with 30 microM ruthenium red and 10 mM procaine, uptake was saturable with a Vmax of 160 +/- 5 nmol.min-1.mg-1, K0.5 of 500 nM free [Ca2+] and slope factor of 1.6. In K(+)-based media, maximum Pi- and oxalate-supported uptake increased to 220 and 260 nmol.min-1.mg-1, respectively. Without phosphocreatine, 45Ca2+ uptake declined under all conditions; this was correlated with a decrease in ATP/ADP. Vmax for 45Ca2+ uptake was increased 20% in hyperthyroid myocytes but depressed 30% in myocytes from heart failure-prone rats. In canine myocytes, Vmax was the same as in normal rat cells, but K0.5 was 830 nM. Without efflux inhibitors, ryanodine caused a concentration-dependent decline in net Pi-supported 45Ca2+ uptake at pCa 6.3 (K0.5 = 1 microM), while 10 microM ryanodine depressed uptake at all pCa between 7.2 and 5.6. Ruthenium red/procaine fully reversed this effect."
https://openalex.org/W2066728696,"The c4 repressors of P1 and P7 inhibit antirepressor synthesis and are solely responsible for heteroimmunity of the phages. We show that c4 is a new type of antisense RNA acting on a target, ant mRNA, that is transcribed from the same promoter. Interaction depends on complementarity of two pairs of short sequences encompassing the ribosome binding site involved in ant expression. We demonstrate that heteroimmunity of P1 and P7 is due to just two substitutions in each of the complementary sequences of c4 and ant mRNA. Based on P1-P7 sequence comparison and a mutant analysis, we propose a secondary structure model for c4 RNA, with the complementary regions in loops as important sites for antisense control."
https://openalex.org/W1602715148,"Human erythroleukemia (HEL) cells phosphorylate [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate to inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate; they also contain all the enzymes to sequentially dephosphorylate [3H]inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and [3H]inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate to inositol. alpha-Thrombin, 1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, and sodium fluoride caused the formation of [3H]inositol phosphates in HEL cells that were previously labeled with [3H]inositol. This indicates agonist-induced activation of phospholipase C and hydrolysis of the inositol phospholipids. Pretreatment of the HEL cells with iloprost, a prostacyclin analog that increases cellular cyclic AMP levels, dramatically reduced the formation of inositol phosphates and the increase of [3H]phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. The inhibitory effects of iloprost were associated with the phosphorylation of a 24-kDa protein, which was detected with an antiserum obtained against the rap 1 protein. The catalytic subunit of protein kinase A inhibited formation of polyphosphoinositides during phosphorylation of the rap 1 protein in membranes. This rap 1 protein might have functional relevance in the inhibition of agonist-induced inositide metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W1926605316,"Myelin basic proteins (MBPs) represent a major component of the myelin membrane which are exclusively expressed by glial cells in the nervous system. The cell type-specific expression of MBP is controlled preferentially at the level of RNA synthesis. To investigate the mechanisms by which the MBP gene is regulated, we analyzed transcriptional regulation of this gene in glial and non-glial cells. We have demonstrated that the 320 base pairs upstream of the MBP transcriptional start site contain regulatory elements that preferentially stimulate transcription of MBPs in glial cells. Using a test vector containing the simian virus 40 (SV40) early promoter placed upstream of the bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, we localized three major promoter elements within the 5'-upstream sequence. These elements, designated MB1, MB4, and MB7, spanning proximal (-14 to -50) and distal (-130 to -169 and -249 to -288) positions with respect to the RNA initiation site, activated SV40 promoter transcription more than 40-fold in glial cells. The promoter distal elements, MB4 and MB7, enhanced SV40 promoter activity 2- and 8-fold, respectively, in L cells. Using the gel mobility shift assay, we have demonstrated that the MBP activators (MB1, MB4, and MB7) interact with multiple proteins derived from glial and L cell extract and result in the formation of several complexes. Comparison of band intensity of these complexes implies that these cells contain both unique and ubiquitous DNA binding proteins that recognize the DNA sequences within these activators. These studies suggest that the MBP promoter consists of several regulatory sequences in which the proximal element, MB1, and one of the distal elements, MB4, are selectively more active in glial cells than in L cells. Thus, these novel regulatory elements, in concert with other sequences, appear to stimulate MBP promoter transcription in glial cells."

https://openalex.org/W1507990006,"The effects of plasma membrane depolarization on cytosolic free calcium ([Ca2+]i) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3) generation were investigated in the human promyelocytic cell line HL-60 differentiated with either dimethyl sulfoxide or retinoic acid into neutrophil-like cells. Increases in [Ca2+]i and accumulation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 were triggered by two chemoattractants fMet-Leu-Phe and leukotriene B4. Plasma membrane potential was depolarized by isoosmotic substitution of NaCl with KCl, by the pore-forming ionophore gramicidin D, or by long term treatment with ouabain. Both Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores and Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane were reduced by prior depolarization of plasma membrane potential regardless of the procedure employed to collapse it. Agonist-induced generation of Ins(1,4,5)P3 was also reduced in parallel in pre-depolarized HL-60 cells. The present findings provide further evidence suggesting that plasma membrane potential can be an important modulator of agonist-activated second messenger generation in myelocytic cells."

https://openalex.org/W1633146689,"The steady-state level of mRNA encoding the glycoprotein hormone alpha-subunit is increased about 4-fold in HeLa cells by cycloheximide (CHX) or puromycin at concentrations that inhibit protein synthesis. This effect is observed in a number of cell lines that ectopically produce alpha-subunit, including ChaGo (brochogenic carcinoma), FL (amnion), and HeLa (cervical carcinoma). No increase in alpha-subunit mRNA is evident in two choriocarcinoma cell lines (JAr, JEG-3) that produce alpha-subunit as an eutopic product. The half-life of alpha-subunit mRNA is unchanged in the presence of CHX, but nuclear run-on assays demonstrate a 2.6-fold greater loading of RNA polymerase on the alpha-subunit gene in nuclei from CHX-treated cells. These results suggest that inhibition of protein synthesis results in higher transcription rates and not in decreased mRNA turnover. A nuclear protein (Mr 50,000) that binds to a DNA fragment located 5' proximal to the alpha-subunit gene but not to more distal 5'-flanking sequence or to the alpha-subunit cDNA has been identified in HeLa but not in JEG-3 cell lines. The p50 DNA binding activity in HeLa cells decreases in the presence of CHX at a rate similar to that at which alpha-subunit mRNA increases. Moreover, in a series of HeLa cell clones, the levels of p50 are directly proportional to the magnitude of induction produced by CHX. These data are consistent with a model for alpha-subunit gene regulation involving a labile repressor and constitute yet another level of differential regulation of the alpha-subunit gene in cells that produce the hormone subunit in an ectopic versus eutopic manner."
