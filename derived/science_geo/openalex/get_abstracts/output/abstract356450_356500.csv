https://openalex.org/W2124770413,"Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades play important roles in regulating plant growth, development, and responses to various environmental stimuli. We demonstrate that MKK9, an MKK, is an upstream activator of the MPKs MPK3 and MPK6 both in vitro and in planta. Expression of active MKK9 protein in transgenic plants induces the synthesis of ethylene and camalexin through the activation of the endogenous MPK3 and MPK6 kinases. As a consequence, transcription of multiple genes responsible for ethylene biosynthesis, ethylene responses, and camalexin biosynthesis is coordinately up-regulated. The activation of MKK9 inhibits hypocotyl elongation in the etiolated seedlings. MKK9-mediated effects on hypocotyl elongation were blocked by the ethylene biosynthesis inhibitor, aminoethoxyvinylglycine, and ethylene receptor antagonist, Ag+. Expression of active MKK9 protein enhances the sensitivity of transgenic seedlings to salt stress, whereas loss of MKK9 activity reduces salt sensitivity indicating a role for MKK9 in the salt stress response. The results reported here reveal that the MKK9-MPK3/MPK6 cascade participates in the regulation of the biosynthesis of ethylene and camalexin and may be an important axis in the stress responses of Arabidopsis.

MAPK cascades are minimally composed of three kinase modules, MAPKKK, MAPKK, and MAPK (called MKKK, MKK, and MPK in Arabidopsis, according to systemic nomenclature), which are linked in various ways to upstream receptors and downstream targets. MAPK cascades play important roles in coordinating stress responses and plant growth and development (1.Tena G. Asai T. Chiu W.L. Sheen J. Curr. Opin.

The Arabidopsis genome encodes 60 MKKKs, 10 MKKs, and 20 MPKs (5.MAPK GroupTrends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 301-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar). The relatively few MKKs imply that various signal transduction pathways converge at the MKK level in MAPK cascades. The 10 MKK genes are classified into four groups according to protein sequence alignments. The MKKs of group A include MKK1, MKK2, and MKK6. MKK1 participates in defense responses (6.Meszaros T. Helfer A. Hatzimasoura E. Magyar Z. Serazetdinova L. Rios G. Bardoczy V. Teige M. Koncz C. Peck S. Bogre L. Plant J. 2006; 48: 485-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), whereas MKK2 mediates the regulation of cold and salt stress signaling (7.Teige M. Scheikl E. Eulgem T. Doczi R. Ichimura K. Shinozaki K. Dangl J.L. Hirt H. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 141-152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). MKK6 is involved in cell division (8.Calderini O. Glab N. Bergounioux C. Heberle-Bors E. Wilson C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 18139-18145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). MKK3, the only member of group B, has roles in jasmonate-mediated developmental signaling and in pathogen defense response signaling (9.Takahashi F. Yoshida R. Ichimura K. Mizoguchi T. Seo S.

MKK4 and MKK5 of group C MKKs mainly function in the stomatal development pathway (11.Wang H. Ngwenyama N. Liu Y. Walker J.C. Zhang S. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 63-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) and defense response signaling pathway (12.Ren D. Yang H. Zhang S. J. Biol.

Nature. 2002; 415: 977-983Crossref PubMed Scopus (2016) Google Scholar). Of the four MKKs in group D, MKK7 functions as an inhibitor of polar auxin transport (14.Dai Y. Wang H. Li B. Huang J. Liu X. Zhou Y. Mou Z. Li J. Plant Cell. 2006; 18: 308-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) and is also involved in generating the mobile signal of systemic acquired resistance (15.Zhang X. Dai Y. Xiong Y. DeFraia C. Li J. Dong X. Mou Z. Plant J. 2007; 52: 1066-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). So far, no transcripts have been identified for MKK8 and MKK10 (5.MAPK GroupTrends Plant Sci. 2002; 7: 301-308Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (951) Google Scholar, 16.Alzwiy I.A. Morris P.C. Plant Sci. 2007; 173: 302-308Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). MKK9 is a negative regulator of seed germination under stress (16.Alzwiy I.A. Morris P.C. Plant Sci. 2007; 173: 302-308Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recently, MKK9 was found to activate MPK3/MPK6, which in turn phosphorylates and positively modulates EIN3 stability, leading to transcription of early ERF (ethylene response factor) genes (17.Yoo S.-D. Cho Y.-H. Tena G. Xiong Y. Sheen J. Nature. 2008; 451: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Phytoalexins, small molecules with antimicrobial activity, are synthesized by plants in response to pathogen attack (18.Hammerschmidt R. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 1999; 37: 285-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Camalexin (3-thiazol-2′-yl-indole), the main phytoalexin in Arabidopsis, is induced by a variety of microorganisms (19.Tsuji J. Jackson E.P. Gage D.A. Hammerschmidt R. Somerville S.C. Plant Physiol. 1992; 98: 1304-1309Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 20.Thomma B.P. Nelissen I. Eggermont K. Broekaert W.F. Plant J. 1999; 19: 163-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) as well as abiotic factors (21.Tsuji J. Zook M. Somerville S.C. Last R.L. Hammerschmidt R. Physiol. Mol. Plant Pathol. 1993; 43: 221-229Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Among the phytoalexin-deficient mutants (PAD1–PAD5), PAD3 is involved in camalexin biosynthesis (22.Glazebrook J. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2005; 43: 205-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (2995) Google Scholar, 23.Parisy V. Poinssot B. Owsianowski L. Buchala A. Glazebrook J. Mauch F. Plant J. 2007; 49: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 24.Jirage D. Tootle T.L. Reuber T.L. Frost L.N. Feys B.J. Parker J.E. Ausubel F.M. Glazebrook J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13583-13588Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). PAD3 encodes a cytochrome P450 monooxygenase 71A15 (CYP71A15) that catalyzes the conversion of dihydrocamalexic acid to camalexin (25.Zhou N. Tootle T.L. Glazebrook J. Plant Cell. 1999; 11: 2419-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 26.Schuhegger R. Nafisi M. Mansourova M. Petersen B.L. Olsen C.E. Svatos A. Halkier B.A. Glawischnig E. Plant Physiol. 2006; 141: 1248-1254Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). CYP71A13, another cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, has been reported to catalyze the conversion of indole-3-acetaldoxime to indole-3-acetonitrile, the first committed step in camalexin biosynthesis (27.Nafisi M. Goregaoker S. Botanga C.J. Glawischnig E. Olsen C.E. Halkier B.A. Glazebrook J. Plant Cell. 2007; 19: 2039-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). Although these mutants highlight the biochemical steps required for camalexin synthesis, much less is known about the signaling components upstream of the camalexin biosynthesis pathway. Most recently, we have shown that camalexin biosynthesis is regulated by MPK3/MPK6. That result directly linked MAPK signaling cascades to camalexin biosynthesis. However, the upstream MKKs responsible for the MPK3/MPK6-mediated camalexin biosynthesis pathway still need to be clarified. For example, it is unclear why activation of MKK4/MKK5 is less efficient in inducing camalexin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis compared with the tobacco ortholog NtMEK2 (28.Ren D. Liu Y. Yang K.-Y. Han L. Mao G. Glazebrook J. Zhang S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 5638-5643Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The phytohormone ethylene is also an important component of plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses (29.van Loon L.C. Geraats B.P.J. Linthorst H.J.M. Trends Plant Sci. 2006; 11: 184-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar, 30.Dong X. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 316-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar). The conversion of S-adenosyl-l-methionine to 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid is catalyzed by the enzyme 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid synthase (ACS) and is generally a rate-limiting step in ethylene biosynthesis pathway (31.Kende H. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 283-307Crossref Scopus (1050) Google Scholar, 32.Adams D.O. Yang S.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 170-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There is evidence that ACS phosphorylation and dephosphorylation are involved in the regulation of ethylene biosynthesis (33.Spanu P. Grosskopf D.G. Felix G. Boller T. Plant Physiol. 1994; 106: 529-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 34.Kim C.Y. Liu Y. Thorne E.T. Yang H. Fukushige H. Gassmann W. Hildebrand D. Sharp R.E. Zhang S. Plant Cell. 2003; 15: 2707-2718Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar, 35.De Laat A.M.M. Van Loon L.C. Physiol. Plant Pathol. 1983; 22: 261-273Crossref Google Scholar, 36.Zhang S. Klessig D.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7433-7438Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Activation of MPK6, the Arabidopsis ortholog of tobacco salicylic acid-induced protein kinase, has been proved to phosphorylate ACS2/ACS6 and to induce ethylene production in transgenic plants (37.Liu Y. Zhang S. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 3386-3399Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Here we report the identification of MKK9 as the upstream kinase of both MPK3 and MPK6 in planta. Activation of MKK9 leads to activation of the endogenous MPK3 and MPK6, the subsequent up-regulation of multiple genes in ethylene and camalexin biosynthetic pathways, and induces high levels of ethylene and camalexin accumulation. Mutation of either MPK3 or MPK6 compromises MKK9-induced ethylene and camalexin accumulation. In addition, activation of MKK9 enhances the sensitivity of transgenic seedling to salt stress. Our results suggest that MKK9 plays an important role in ethylene and camalexin biosynthesis and salt stress response in Arabidopsis. Plant Materials—Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype “Columbia-0”) wild type, mutants, and transgenic seeds were surface-sterilized. After cold treatment at 4 °C for 2 days, the seeds were germinated and grown on 0.5× MS, 1% agar, 1% sucrose plates. For transformation and mutants screens, Col-0 wild type seedlings were transferred from plates to soil and grown at 22 °C in a growth room with a 12-h photoperiod at a photon flux density of 100 μE/m–2 s–1. To test the expression of transgenes, the fully expended leaves from 4-week-old plants were taken at the indicated times after treatment with 15 μm dexamethasone (DEX) (Sigma). For ethylene and camalexin assays, seedlings from plates were transferred to GC vials with liquid culture medium (0.5× MS medium, 0.025% Mes and 0.25% sucrose, pH 5.6) and grown in a growth room at 22 °C under continuous light at a photon flux density of 70 μE/m–2 s–1. Two-week-old seedlings were treated with DEX added directly to the medium at a final concentration of 1 μm. The samples were collected at indicated times, quick frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at –80 °C until use. Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv. Xanthi-nc) plants were grown in soil under the same growth condition as Arabidopsis plants. Six- to 7-week-old plants were used for transient transformation experiments. Salt Treatment and Pathogen Inoculations—For salt-response assays, 4 days after the seeds were germinated and grown on 0.5× MS, 1% agar, 1% sucrose plates, seedlings were transferred to the 0.5× MS, 1% agar, 1% sucrose plate with 100 mm NaCl in the presence or absence of 0.02 μm of DEX. After an additional 15 days of growth, the photographs were taken, and samples were collected, as described above. Three-week-old soil-grown seedlings were sprayed with 0.02 μm DEX. One hour after DEX treatment, seedlings were inoculated with Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola ES4326, and the determination of bacterial growth was as described previously (23.Parisy V. Poinssot B. Owsianowski L. Buchala A. Glazebrook J. Mauch F. Plant J. 2007; 49: 159-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Cloning of MKKs and MPKs—Total RNA was isolated from samples with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Reverse transcription was performed using (dT)16 as primer and total RNA as template. Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) was used to reverse transcript the poly(A+) mRNAs. The coding regions of MKK9 and MPKs were obtained by PCR. MKK9, MPK3, and MPK6 were cloned into the pEGM-T easy vector, and MPK4 and MPK12 were cloned into pBlueScript vector. Point mutations were introduced with the Quick-Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and confirmed by sequencing. Primers were as follows: MKK9 (At1g73500), 5′-CATATGGCTTTAGTACGTGAACGTCGTC-3′ and 5′-GTCGACTCAAAGATCTTCCCGGAGAAAAG-3′; MPK3 (At3g45640), 5′-CATATGAACACCGGCGGTGG-3′ and 5′-ACCGTATGTTGGATTGAGTG-3′; MPK4 (At4g01370), 5′-GGATCCATGTCGGCGGAGAGT-3′ and 5′-GTCGACCACTGAGTCTTGAGGATT-3′; MPK6 (At2g43790), 5′-CATATGGACGGTGGTCAGGTCAA-3′ and 5′-TTGCTGATATTCTGGATTGAAA-3′; and MPK12 (At2g46070) 5′-GGATCCATGTCTGGAGAATCAAGC-3′ and 5′-GTCGACGTGGTCAGGATTGAATTTG-3′. MKK9 gene mutants with an NdeI site added before the first ATG were cloned into a modified pBlueScript vector with a FLAG epitope tag coding sequence at the 5′-end. The NcoI/SalI fragment of FLAG-MKK9 mutants from a modified pBlueScript vector were then ligated in-frame into the pET28a (+) vector. The NdeI/SalI fragment of MPK3 and MPK6 from the pBlueScript vector and the BamHI/SalI fragment of MPK4 and MPK12 from the pGEM T Easy vector were ligated into pET30a(+). All the resultant constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21. The MKK9 mutants with a FLAG epitope tag coding sequence were inserted into the SpeI/XhoI sites of the steroid-inducible pTA7002 binary vector (38.Aoyama T. Chua N.-H. Plant J. 1997; 11: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). The Ω sequence from tobacco mosaic virus was placed before the FLAG epitope tag coding sequence. All the resultant constructs were electroporated into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58C1. Preparation of Recombinant Protein—E. coli cells (BL21 strain) transformed with pET28a(+) or pET30a(+) constructs were inoculated in LB broth containing 50 mg/liter kanamycin with 200 rpm shaking until the A600 reached 0.6. The culture was incubated at 19 °C for an additional 3 h after the addition of isopropyl d-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm. The recombinant MPK proteins were affinity-purified using a Ni2+-chelating Sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) column, and MKK9 mutant proteins were purified on an anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel column (Sigma). Kinase Assays—An autophosphorylation assay mixture (30 μl), containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2 or MnCl2,1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 2 μg of purified recombinant FLAG-MKK9 or its mutants derivatives, was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 10 μl of 4× SDS loading buffer. The reaction mixture was heated at 95 °C for 2 min and electrophoresed on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried, and the kinase autophosphorylation activities were detected by autoradiography. Phosphorylation of MKK9 wild type and its mutants on MPKs were determined using His-tagged MPKs (1 μg) as substrates. The reaction was carried out under the same conditions as the autophosphorylation assay, except 0.1 μg of FLAG-MKK9 was used in each reaction. Immunopreciptation experiments were performed, as described previously (39.Kus J.V. Zaton K. Sarkar R. Cameron R.K. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), with anti-p48N and anti-p44N antibodies. Kinase activities of the immunocomplex were determined by an in-gel kinase activity assay as described previously (12.Ren D. Yang H. Zhang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 559-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Agrobacterium-mediated Transformation—Agrobacterium-mediated transient transformation experiments in tobacco were performed, as described previously (39.Kus J.V. Zaton K. Sarkar R. Cameron R.K. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 479-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). The stable transgenic Arabidopsis plants were generated using the flower-dipping method (40.Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenic plants were selected on 0.5× MS plates with 15 mg/liter hygromycin. The T2 and T3 generations of transgenic plants were used for experiments. T-DNA Insertional Mutants and Crosses—T-DNA insert mutants of MPK3, MPK6, MKK9, and PAD3 were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (mpk3, SALK_100651; mpk6, SALK_127507; pad3, SALK_026585; and mkk9, SAIL_060_H06). Homozygous null mutants were screened by genomic PCR and confirmed by RT-PCR. mpk3, mpk6, and pad3 were crossed into the MKK9DD transgenic background. The MKK9DD allele was selected for hygromycin resistance and transgene expression. mpk3, mpk6, and pad3 were identified by PCR of genomic DNA. Homozygous MKK9DD/mpk3, MKK9DD/mpk6, and MKK9DD/pad3 F3 plants were used for experiments. Protein Extraction—Total protein was extracted from samples by grinding in extraction buffer (100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 10 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm NaF, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μgml–1 leupeptin, 5 μgml–1 aprotinin, 5% glycerol). After centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 30 min, supernatants were transferred to clean tubes and stored at –80 °C until needed. For total protein extractions from tobacco leaf tissues, the supernatants from the first centrifugation were quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for another 20 min. The concentrations of protein extracts were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Immunoblot Assay—For immunoblot assays, 7.5 μg of total protein or 0.25 μg of recombinant protein per lane was separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked for 1 h in TBST buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.05% Tween 20) with 5% no-fat dried milk at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated with the primary antibody (1:10,000). After three washes with TBST buffer, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (1:10,000). The membranes were visualized by using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Roche Applied System). The primary antibodies used were anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma) and anti-6× His tag antibodies (R & D Systems). LC-MS Analysis—Arabidopsis seedlings in GC vials were treated with DEX. Eight hours after treatment, the culture medium was collected. The culture media were extracted with 2 volumes of chloroform, and then the chloroform was completely evaporated. The remaining residue was dissolved in a small volume of methanol. LC-MS was performed using a 1100 Series LC/MSD Trap VL (Agilent Technologies). An XDB C18 column (Agilent 5 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm) was used at a flow rate of 1 ml min–1. The mobile phase was methanol/H2O (9:1, v/v), and the column temperature was kept at 20 °C. The mass spectrometer was run in electrospray ionization mode. A camalexin standard was used as a control. Measurement of Ethylene and Camalexin Production—The GC vials containing Arabidopsis seedlings were flushed and capped immediately after treatment with 1 μm DEX. At the indicated times, ethylene levels in the GC vials were determined by gas chromatography as previously described (41.Bohman S. Staal J. Thomma B.P.H.J. Wang M. Dixelius C. Plant J. 2004; 37: 9-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). For inhibitor treatments, inhibitors (AVG in 2 μm, CoCl2 in 100 μm, and Ag+ in 100 μm) were added to GC vials 1 h before the DEX addition, respectively. The camalexin in the culture medium was measured using an HITACHI F4500 spectrofluorometer (315 nm excitation and 385 nm emission), and the concentration of camalexin was determined by comparison with a camalexin standard curve. Growth Response Assays—For etiolated seedling growth assays, seedlings were grown for 3 days in the dark at 23 °C, on 0.5× MS plates supplemented with 0.02 μm DEX alone or plus 2 μm AVG or 100 μm Ag+ as indicated. To synchronize germination, surface-sterilized seeds were cold-treated at 4 °C for 4 days in the dark. Quantitative RT-PCR Analysis—RT was performed with 2.4 μg of total RNA and 0.6 μg of (dT)16 primer and Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega). Aliquots of the products of RT reaction were used as templates for quantitative PCR (Q-PCR). Q-PCR was run on a DNA Engine Optican II system (MJ Research) as described previously (42.Liu H. Wang Y.

MKK9 Is an Upstream MAPKK of MPK3 and MPK6—MAPKKs are activated through the phosphorylation of two Ser/Thr residues in a conserved (S/T)XXX(S/T) motif between kinase subdomains VII and VIII by MAPKK kinases (43.Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2274) Google Scholar). Phospho-mimetic mutation of the two S/T residues in the kinase catalytic domain to Glu or Asp results in a constitutively active MAPKK (44.Mansour S.J. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K. Vande Woude G.F. Ahn N.G. Science. 1994; 265: 966-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (1260) Google Scholar, 45.Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Maeda T. Witten E.A. Saito H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1289-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Conversely, an Lys to Arg mutation of a conserved residue in the ATP-binding site results in an MAPKK that is constitutively inactive. To facilitate the study of MKK9, we created an active allele (MKK9DD) by mutating Thr-201 and Ser-205 to Asp and an inactive allele (MKK9KR) by mutating Lys-76 to Arg. The activities of FLAG-tagged recombinant proteins were then determined in autophosphorylation assays. As expected, MKK9KR had no detectable autophosphorylation activity. Both MKK9DD and MKK9WT were found to have autophosphorylation activity in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+ ions (Fig. 1A). The autophosphorylation activity of MKK9WT places MKK9 in the autoactive class of MAPKKs (46.Kiegerl S. Cardinale F. Siligan C. Gross A. Baudouin E. Liwosz A. Eklof S. Till S. Bogre L. Hirt H.

Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 703-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). To identify possible downstream targets of MKK9, we performed in vitro phosphorylation assays using various His-tagged MPKs as substrates. MKK9DD and MKK9WT phosphorylate HisMPK3 and HisMPK6 but not HisMPK4 and HisMPK12. The phosphorylation of HisMPK3 and HisMPK6 by MKK9DD and MKK9WT enhanced the kinase activity of the MPKs as detected in a subsequent in-gel kinase assay (Fig. 1B). To test whether MPK3 and MPK6 are substrates of MKK9 in planta, we assayed MAPK activity in the leaf extracts of tobacco plants transient-transformed with MKK9 mutant genes, and in Arabidopsis transgenic plants carrying MKK9 mutant genes under the control of a steroid-inducible promoter (12.Ren D. Yang H. Zhang S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 559-565Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 28.Ren D. Liu Y. Yang K.-Y. Han L. Mao G. Glazebrook J. Zhang S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 5638-5643Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Expression of either MKK9DD or MKK9WT in tobacco leaves activated the endogenous WIPK (wounding-induced protein kinase) and SIPK (salicylic acid-induced protein kinase) proteins, as proved by pulldown experiments with SIPK- and WIPK-specific antibodies (Fig. 1C). On the other hand, the expression of the inactive mutant, MKK9KR, resulted in very low SIPK activity. Stable expression of either MKK9DD or MKK9WT in Arabidopsis transgenic plants activated both MPK3 and MPK6, as demonstrated in kinase activity assays with the double mutants of MKK9DD/mpk3 and MKK9DD/mpk6 (Fig. 1D). These results suggest that MKK9 is an upstream MAPKK for MPK3 and MPK6 in planta. The results are consistent with the conclusions of Yoo et al. (17.Yoo S.-D. Cho Y.-H. Tena G. Xiong Y. Sheen J. Nature. 2008; 451: 789-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) obtained from protoplast assays. Activation of MKK9-induced Ethylene Biosynthesis in Arabidopsis—Because activation of MPK6 is known to increase the biosynthesis of ethylene through the phosphorylation and stabilization of ACS2/ACS6, we assayed ethylene production in MKK9 transgenic plants. Five independent transgenic lines for each MKK9 mutant construct were used for ethylene measurement. As shown in Fig. 2A, MKK9DD and MKK9WT plants produced high levels of ethylene 12 h after the induction of transgene expression, whereas MKK9KR and vector control plants did not produce any detectable ethylene. Activation of MKK4 and MKK5, two other MKKs in Arabidopsis, has been reported to activate endogenous MPK3/MPK6 (12.Ren D. Yang H. Zhang S. J. Biol.

As shown in Fig. 2A, activation of the MKK4 or MKK5 leads to lower levels of ethylene production than does activated MKK9.

Previous studies have established the ratio of Aβ40 to Aβ42 as an important factor in determining the fibrillogenesis, toxicity, and pathological distribution of Aβ. To better understand the molecular basis underlying the pathologic consequences associated with alterations in the ratio of Aβ40 to Aβ42, we probed the concentration- and ratio-dependent interactions between well defined states of the two peptides at different stages of aggregation along the amyloid formation pathway. We report that monomeric Aβ40 alters the kinetic stability, solubility, and morphological properties of Aβ42 aggregates and prevents their conversion into mature fibrils. Aβ40, at approximately equimolar ratios (Aβ40/Aβ42 ∼ 0.5–1), inhibits (>50%) fibril formation by monomeric Aβ42, whereas inhibition of protofibrillar Aβ42 fibrillogenesis is achieved at lower, substoichiometric ratios (Aβ40/Aβ42 ∼ 0.1). The inhibitory effect of Aβ40 on Aβ42 fibrillogenesis is reversed by the introduction of excess Aβ42 monomer. Additionally, monomeric Aβ42 and Aβ40 are constantly recycled and compete for binding to the ends of protofibrillar and fibrillar Aβ aggregates. Whereas the fibrillogenesis of both monomeric species can be seeded by fibrils composed of either peptide, Aβ42 protofibrils selectively seed the fibrillogenesis of monomeric Aβ42 but not monomeric Aβ40. Finally, we also show that the amyloidogenic propensities of different individual and mixed Aβ species correlates with their relative neuronal toxicities. These findings, which highlight specific points in the amyloid peptide equilibrium that are highly sensitive to the ratio of Aβ40 to Aβ42, carry important implications for the pathogenesis and current therapeutic strategies of Alzheimer disease.

The predominant Aβ species in human plasma and CSF, as well as in conditioned media of APP-expressing cells, is Aβ40 (∼90%) followed by Aβ42 (∼10%).

To evaluate the consequences of altering the ratio Aβ40/Aβ42, several groups have investigated the effect of co-expressing the two Aβ variants (Aβ40 and Aβ42) or altering the expression level of one or the other variant in cellular and animal models of AD. These studies and other studies in human patients demonstrate that the ratio of Aβ40 to Aβ42 is an important determinant of the distribution of amyloid pathology (i.e. parenchymal or vascular amyloid deposition) in the brains of patients with AD and transgenic AD mouse models (18Gravina S.A.

The molecular mechanisms by which changes in the Aβ40/Aβ42 ratio modulate the aggregation and toxicity of Aβ and influence the amyloid pathology distribution in the AD brain remain the subjects of considerable debate. Aβ40 inhibits fibril formation by Aβ42 (22Jarrett J.T. Berger E.P. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 4693-4697Crossref PubMed Scopus (1753) Google Scholar, 38Hasegawa K. Yamaguchi I.

More recently, Yan and Wang (41Yan Y. Wang C. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 369: 909-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) used differential NMR isotope labeling to demonstrate that Aβ40 prevents aggregation of monomeric Aβ42 and is capable of being exchanged for Aβ42 monomer in Aβ42 aggregates. In the present study, we determined the preferential effect of Aβ40 on the kinetic stability, solubility, and fibrillogenesis rate of specific aggregation states of Aβ42, including monomers, protofibrils, and fibrils. Additionally, we explored the dynamics of exchange between monomeric Aβ40 and Aβ42 at the end of protofibrils and fibrils formed by each peptide and determined the effect of these interactions on the aggregate growth and morphology in vitro. Finally, we examined the ability of Aβ42 fibrils and protofibrils to seed the aggregation of Aβ40 and vice versa by monitoring the seeding effects of homologous and heterologous sequence on the lag phase, elongation phase, and steady-state phase of fibril formation of monomeric Aβ40 and Aβ42. The specificity of interaction between Aβ40 and different Aβ42 aggregation states was validated by using Aβ40-1 (reverse) as a control peptide. The present work provides novel mechanistic and structural insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the consequences associated with altered Aβ40/Aβ42 ratio. The implications of these findings for intervention strategies for AD are also discussed. Chemicals and reagents of analytical grade were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich unless indicated otherwise. Best quality distilled water was used for preparation of buffers and solutions, which were filtered through 0.65-μm DVPP membranes (Millipore) before use. Aβ peptides 1-40, 1-42, and 40-1 were synthesized and purified by Dr. James I. Elliott at Yale University (New Haven, CT). Protofibrillar (PF) and monomeric (M) forms of Aβ were prepared according to the protocols described previously (42Lashuel H.A. Hartley D.M. Petre B.M. Wall J.S. Simon M.N. Walz T. Lansbury Jr., P.T.

The pH of the resultant solutions was adjusted with 2 m Tris base, pH 7.4. After centrifugation (8000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min) the supernatant was injected into a size exclusion chromatography column Superdex 75 HR 10/30 (GE Healthcare) that had been equilibrated previously with 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Peptides were fractionated at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min and eluted in 1.5-column volumes. Aβ elution was monitored by UVabsorbance at three different wavelengths: 210, 254, and 280 nm. Under these conditions, Aβ42 eluted as two well separated peaks; one corresponding to the void volume of Superdex 75 containing Aβ protofibrils (Aβ42PF) and the second peak corresponding to monomeric Aβ (Aβ42M) (supplemental Fig. 1). Aβ40 and Aβ40-1 elute predominantly as single peaks corresponding to monomeric species (data not shown). The protein concentrations of the various Aβ fractions was estimated by UV absorbance at 280 nm in 10-mm path-length cuvettes using the theoretical molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm (1490 m–1 cm–1) (43Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3437) Google Scholar) and/or using the Micro BCA protein assay (Pierce) when needed. Co-incubation of Monomeric Aβ40 with Protofibrillar or Monomeric Aβ42—Monomeric and protofibrillar preparations of Aβ42 and Aβ40 obtained by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) were adjusted to a final concentration of 10–20 μm in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and placed in a 37 °C incubator without agitation. For co-incubation studies, protofibrillar and monomeric Aβ42 fractions were mixed with monomeric Aβ40 at molar ratios (Aβ42M:Aβ40M) of 10:1, 10:5, and 10:10 (all concentrations in μm) and allowed to aggregate at 37 °C without agitation. Fibril formation and protein solubility were monitored by thioflavin T (ThT) binding assay, negative staining transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and analytical SEC as described below. In parallel, the specificity of Aβ40 interactions with Aβ42 was validated by co-incubation with the control peptide Aβ40-1. Fibril Elongation Studies—To probe the effect of monomeric Aβ on the elongation and reassociation of Aβ42 fibrils, we first generated Aβ42 fibrils by incubating 10 μm monomeric Aβ42 (Aβ42M) for 96 h. The fibrils were mechanically fragmented into smaller fibrillar structures (100–300 nm long) by ultra-sonication on ice using a Vibra Cell™ instrument (Sonics Inc.) equipped with a 2-mm diameter microtip (20 × 5 s pulses; amplitude, 40%; output, 6 watts). The sonicated fibrils (Aβ42SF) were incubated: (i) in isolation; (ii) with monomeric Aβ42 (10 μm); (iii) with monomeric Aβ40 (10 μm); or (iv) with a 1:1 mixture of monomeric Aβ42:40 (20 μm final Aβ concentration). Fibril elongation and reformation of mature Aβ fibrils was monitored by ThT fluorescence and TEM. Seeding the Fibrillogenesis of Monomeric Aβ (Aβ40 and Aβ42) with Fibrils Derived from Aβ40 and Aβ42—To probe the ability of Aβ42 fibrils to accelerate the fibrillogenesis of monomeric Aβ40 and vice versa, 20 μm monomeric Aβ (Aβ42 or Aβ40) was incubated with the following: (i) 10 μg/ml sonicated Aβ42 fibrils (Aβ42SF, once); (ii) 20 μg/ml sonicated Aβ42 fibrils (Aβ42SF, twice); (iii) 10 μg/ml sonicated Aβ40 fibrils (Aβ40SF, once); and (iv) 20 μg/ml sonicated Aβ40 fibrils (Aβ40SF, twice). The extent of fibril formation was determined by ThT fluorescence and TEM. ThT fluorescence data were normalized by subtracting the contribution from sonicated fibrils. Seeding the Fibrillogenesis of Monomeric Aβ (Aβ40 and Aβ42) with Aβ42 Protofibrils—20 μm monomeric Aβ (Aβ40 or Aβ42) was co-incubated with different molar ratios of protofibrillar Aβ42 (monomeric Aβ:Aβ42PF; 20:1, 20:2 and 20:4; all final concentrations in μm) and fibril formation was monitored by ThT fluorescence after subtracting the contribution from protofibrillar Aβ42. To probe the specificity of interactions between the monomeric and aggregated forms of Aβ42 and Aβ40, we also evaluated the capacity of sonicated fibrils and protofibrillar species of both peptides (Aβ40 and Aβ42) to seed the fibrillogenesis of Aβ40-1 (20 μm) in a similar fashion. ThT binding assay was performed by mixing aliquots of 10–20 μm Aβ with 10–20 μm ThT dye (Aβ:ThT 1:1) and 50 mm glycine-NaOH, pH 8.5, in Nunc 384-well fluorescence plates (Fisher Scientific). ThT fluorescence of each sample was measured in an Analyst AD fluorometer (Molecular Devices) at excitation and emission wavelengths of 450 and 485 nm, respectively. The samples were analyzed in duplicates at selected time points. 5 μl of sample was applied to carbon-coated Formvar 200 mesh grids (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and incubated at room temperature for 60 s. The grids were then washed sequentially by depositing 10-μl droplets of double distilled sterile water (2 times) followed by a 10-μl droplet of fresh 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate, which remained on the grid for 30 s. After each step, the excess solution was blotted with Whatman filter paper, and the grids were vacuum-dried from the edges. The samples were analyzed using a Philips CM-10 TEM microscope operated at 100 kV acceleration voltage. Analytical SEC was performed to quantify the relative amount of soluble (monomeric and protofibrillar) Aβ in solution at selected time points during the aggregation experiments. For this purpose a SEC column Superdex 75 PC 3.2/30 (GE Healthcare) was connected to a Waters Separation Module 2795 equipped with a photo diode array detector (Waters Corp.). Aliquots (150 μl) of the samples were centrifuged (8500 × g at 4 °C for 10 min), and 50 μl of supernatant was injected into the column. Samples were individually analyzed by UV absorbance (wavelengths 210, 254, and 280 nm) at a flow rate of 0.05 ml/min. Primary Cell Cultures—Rat embryonic (E16) cortical cultures were established using a previously described procedure (44Zala D. Benchoua A. Brouillet E. Perrin V. Gaillard M.C. Zurn A.D. Aebischer P. Deglon N. Neurobiol. Dis. 2005; 20: 785-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Briefly, neurons were plated at a density of 30,000 cells/well in 96-well dishes (Costar™, Corning) previously coated with poly-l-lysine (Mr 30′000–70′000). On in vitro day 4, half of the medium was replaced with freshly prepared Neurobasal™ medium supplemented with 2% B27 (Invitrogen), 1× penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen), 0.5 mm l-glutamine, and 15 mm KCl. Subsequently, half of the medium was changed weekly. On in vitro day 23, half of the primary culture medium was replaced with complete Neurobasal medium containing one-fifth or one-tenth volume of amyloid peptide species with varying concentrations of Aβ40M, Aβ42M, Aβ42PF, and Aβ42F and 1:1 molar mixtures thereof. Cells were subsequently incubated with Aβ species for 7 days. All amyloid peptide species were delivered in 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4. Immunostaining—Cell cultures were washed with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Fluka) for 15 min at 4 °C. Cultures were subsequently washed with PBS and then incubated for 1 h in a blocking solution of PBS supplemented with 10% normal goat serum (DakoCytomation) and 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. The cells were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in blocking solution containing mouse monoclonal anti-NeuN antibody (1/400, Chemicon Inc.). The next day, cells were washed and incubated for 2 h with a fluorescent secondary antibody (Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse; 1:1,000; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) followed by PBS washes. Immunostained cells were then analyzed with a BD Pathway 855 Bioimager (BD Biosciences). Images for quantitative analyses were acquired under nonsaturating exposure conditions, and image analysis was performed with NIH ImageJ software. Isolation and Characterization of Protofibrillar and Monomeric Aβ—TEM images of protofibrillar Aβ42 (Aβ42PF) fractions revealed predominantly curvilinear structures with an average length and diameter of 60–100 and 4–6 nm, respectively (supplemental Fig. 1B). In addition, spherical aggregates of different diameters (6–10 nm) were also observed occasionally. The second elution peak corresponding to monomeric Aβ42 (Aβ42M) did not show the presence of any recognizable aggregates by TEM (supplemental Fig. 1D). 10–20 μm concentrations of protofibrillar and monomeric Aβ42 species converted readily into fibrils upon incubation at 37 °C (supplemental Fig. 1, C and E). After 96 h of incubation, almost all Aβ42M had aggregated into a network of long intertwining fibrils (supplemental Fig. 1E), whereas significant amounts of Aβ42 protofibrils persisted and coexisted with fibrils under identical conditions (supplemental Fig. 1C). Unlike Aβ42, Aβ40 and Aβ40-1 (reverse) eluted predominantly as a single monomeric peak under the same solubilization conditions (data not shown) and did not form fibrils under the conditions used for Aβ42 fibrillogenesis studies (supplemental Fig. 2, A, C, and E). Fibril formation by monomeric Aβ40 (Aβ40M) required gentle agitation (300 rpm) and higher concentrations (supplemental Fig. 2, B, D, and F). Monomeric Aβ40 Inhibits the Fibrillogenesis of Monomeric Aβ42 in a Concentration-dependent Manner—To probe the effects of monomeric Aβ40 interactions on the self-assembly and fibril formation of monomeric Aβ42, we co-incubated SEC-isolated Aβ42M with increasing concentrations of Aβ40M (see “Experimental Procedures”). We found that Aβ40M inhibited the fibrillogenesis of Aβ42M in a concentration-dependent manner. After co-incubation for 96 h, strong (>50%) inhibition of monomeric Aβ42M fibrillogenesis was observed in samples containing both peptides at Aβ40M/Aβ42M ratios ≈ 0.5–1 (Fig. 1A). However, the presence of Aβ40M, even at lower concentrations (Aβ40M:Aβ42M ∼ 0.1) led to a transient population of protofibrillar species (Fig. 1B), which disappeared subsequently. In the absence of Aβ40, Aβ42M aggregated rapidly and formed long intertwining fibrillar networks without the accumulation of protofibrils (supplemental Fig. 1E). In contrast, co-incubation with Aβ40M favored the formation of short, flexible protofibrillar structures (Fig. 1, C and D, and Scheme 1), which did not appear to convert to mature elongated fibrils. Our data suggest that Aβ40M interferes with the ability of Aβ42M to form mature fibrils but does not interfere with its ability to form higher order prefibrillar aggregates. Under no conditions did we observe that mixtures of monomeric Aβ40 and Aβ42 remained as stable monomers or formed stable heterodimers on the time scale of our experiments (24–96 h).SCHEME 1Monomeric Aβ40 inhibits the ability of Aβ42 to form mature amyloid fibrils. The arrows represent the relative concentration of each species.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Kinetic Stabilization of Aβ42 Protofibrils by Monomeric Aβ40—Next, we probed the interactions of monomeric Aβ (Aβ40 and Aβ42) with protofibrillar Aβ42 and assessed the consequences of such interactions on the elongation Aβ42 protofibrils into mature fibrils. For this purpose, we co-incubated Aβ42PF with monomeric Aβ (Aβ40M or Aβ42M) at different molar ratios (AβPF:AβM, 10:1, 10:5, and 10:10; all final concentrations in μm) (Scheme 2). The addition of Aβ42M to Aβ42PF at increasing molar ratios resulted in enhanced ThT binding (Fig. 2A), consistent with the accelerated conversion of Aβ42PF into mature fibrillar structures (Fig. 2E). SEC analysis after 48 h of co-incubation revealed that the majority of monomeric and protofibrillar Aβ42 were converted into insoluble aggregates and were no longer detectable in solution supernatant after centrifugation (Fig. 2C). Interestingly, the effect of Aβ40M co-incubation on inhibition of Aβ42PF fibrillar conversion was independent of ratio. In the presence of Aβ40M, ThT fluorescence of Aβ42PF remained virtually unchanged even after co-incubation for 96 h (Fig. 2B). To determine whether the lack of a rise in ThT fluorescence was due to stabilization of Aβ42PF or formation of low ThT-binding Aβ aggregates, samples containing mixtures of Aβ42PF and Aβ40M were subjected to further analyses by SEC and TEM. When purified Aβ42PF were reinjected into an analytical Superdex 75 PC 3.2/30 SEC column, we consistently observed two peaks corresponding to Aβ42PF and Aβ42M. This may have happened because Aβ42PF are in rapid equilibrium with monomers and/or a population of the Aβ42PF is more susceptible to dissociation upon interaction with the column matrix. After 24 h of co-incubation in the presence of ≥1 μm A"
https://openalex.org/W2058266230,"Diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer caused by cigarette smoke affect millions of people worldwide. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that influences responses to certain environmental pollutants such as tobacco smoke. However, the physiological function(s) of the AhR is unknown. Herein we propose that the physiologic role of the AhR is to limit inflammation. We show that lung fibroblasts from AhR(-/-) mice produce a heightened inflammatory response to cigarette smoke, typified by increased levels of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and prostaglandins (PGs), when compared with wild type (AhR(+/+)) fibroblasts. This response was dependent on AhR expression as transient transfection of an AhR expression plasmid into AhR(-/-) fibroblasts significantly attenuated the smoke-induced COX-2 and PG production, confirming the anti-inflammatory role of the AhR. The AhR can interact with NF-kappaB. However, the heightened inflammatory response observed in AhR(-/-) fibroblasts was not the result of NF-kappaB (p50/p65) activation. Instead it was coupled with a loss of the NF-kappaB family member RelB in AhR(-/-) fibroblasts. Taken together, these studies provide compelling evidence that AhR expression limits proinflammatory COX-2 and PG production by maintaining RelB expression. The association between RelB and AhR may represent a new therapeutic and more selective target with which to combat inflammation-associated diseases."

Tumor-bearing mice were imaged with MR before and after administration of either alpha(5)beta(1)(RGD) or irrelevant RGS-paramagnetic nanoparticles. In experiment 2, mice received saline or alpha(5)beta(1)(alpha(nu)beta(3))- or alpha(nu)beta(3)-targeted fumagillin nanoparticles on days 7, 11, 15, and 19 posttumor implant. On day 22, MRI was performed using alpha(5)beta(1)(alpha(nu)beta(3))-targeted paramagnetic nanoparticles to monitor the antiangiogenic response. 3D reconstructions of alpha(5)beta(1)(RGD)-signal enhancement revealed a sparse, asymmetrical pattern of angiogenesis along the tumor periphery, which occupied <2.0% tumor surface area. alpha(5)beta(1)-targeted rhodamine nanoparticles colocalized with FITC-lectin corroborated the peripheral neovascular signal. alpha(5)beta(1)(alpha(nu)beta(3))-fumagillin nanoparticles decreased neovasculature to negligible levels relative to control; alpha(nu)beta(3)-targeted fumagillin nanoparticles were less effective (P>0.05). Reduction of angiogenesis in MDA-MB-435 tumors from low to negligible levels did not decrease tumor volume. MR molecular imaging may be useful for characterizing tumors with sparse neovasculature that are unlikely to have a reduced growth response to targeted antiangiogenic therapy."
https://openalex.org/W1989571181,"Lipins are the founding members of a novel family of Mg(2+)-dependent phosphatidate phosphatases (PAP1 enzymes) that play key roles in fat metabolism and lipid biosynthesis. Despite their importance, there is still little information on how their activity is regulated. Here we demonstrate that the functions of lipin 1 and 2 are evolutionarily conserved from unicellular eukaryotes to mammals. The two lipins display distinct intracellular localization in HeLa M cells, with a pool of lipin 2 exhibiting a tight membrane association. Small interfering RNA-mediated silencing of lipin 1 leads to a dramatic decrease of the cellular PAP1 activity in HeLa M cells, whereas silencing of lipin 2 leads to an increase of lipin 1 levels and PAP1 activity. Consistent with their distinct functions in HeLa M cells, lipin 1 and 2 exhibit reciprocal patterns of protein expression in differentiating 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Lipin 2 levels increase in lipin 1-depleted 3T3-L1 cells without rescuing the adipogenic defects, whereas depletion of lipin 2 does not inhibit adipogenesis. Finally, we show that the PAP1 activity of both lipins is inhibited by phosphorylation during mitosis, leading to a decrease in the cellular PAP1 activity during cell division. We propose that distinct and non-redundant functions of lipin 1 and 2 regulate lipid production during the cell cycle and adipocyte differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W2044323236,"ADP-ribosylation factor (Arf) and related small GTPases play crucial roles in membrane traffic within the exo- and endocytic pathways. Arf proteins in their GTP-bound state are associated with curved membrane buds and tubules, frequently together with effector coat proteins to which they bind. Here we report that Arf1 is found on membrane tubules originating from the Golgi complex where it colocalizes with COPI and GGA1 vesicle coat proteins. Arf1 also induces tubulation of liposomes in vitro. Mutations within the amino-terminal amphipathic helix (NTH) of Arf1 affect the number of Arf1-positive tubules in vivo and its property to tubulate liposomes. Moreover, hydrophilic substitutions within the hydrophobic part of its NTH impair Arf1-catalyzed budding of COPI vesicles in vitro. Our data indicate that GTP-controlled local induction of high curvature membranes is an important property of Arf1 that might be shared by a subgroup of Arf/Arl family GTPases."
https://openalex.org/W2095050803,"Little is known about the mechanisms by which the lung epithelial progenitors are initially patterned and how proximal-distal boundaries are established and maintained when the lung primordium forms and starts to branch. Here we identified a number of Notch pathway components in respiratory progenitors of the early lung, and we investigated the role of Notch in lung pattern formation. By preventing gamma-secretase cleavage of Notch receptors, we have disrupted global Notch signaling in the foregut and in the lung during the initial stages of murine lung morphogenesis. We demonstrate that Notch signaling is not necessary for lung bud initiation; however, Notch is required to maintain a balance of proximal-distal cell fates at these early stages. Disruption of Notch signaling dramatically expands the population of distal progenitors, altering morphogenetic boundaries and preventing formation of proximal structures. Our data suggest a novel mechanism in which Notch and fibroblast growth factor signaling interact to control the proximal-distal pattern of forming airways in the mammalian lung."
https://openalex.org/W2019149262,"The cross-linking of polysaccharides to assemble new cell wall in fungi requires mechanisms by which a preexisting linkage is broken for each new one made, to allow for the absence of free energy sources outside the plasma membrane. Previous work showed that Crh1p and Crh2p, putative transglycosylases, are required for the linkage of chitin to beta(1-3)glucose branches of beta(1-6)glucan in the cell wall of budding yeast. To explore the linking reaction in vivo and in vitro, we used fluorescent sulforhodamine-linked laminari-oligosaccharides as artificial chitin acceptors. In vivo, fluorescence was detected in bud scars and at a lower level in the cell contour, both being dependent on the CRH genes. The linking reaction was also shown in digitonin-permeabilized cells, with UDP-N-acetylglucosamine as the substrate for nascent chitin production. Both the nucleotide and the Crh proteins were required here. A gas1 mutant that overexpresses Crh1p showed very high fluorescence both in intact and permeabilized cells. In the latter, fluorescence was still incorporated in patches in the absence of UDP-GlcNAc. Isolated cell walls of this strain, when incubated with sulforhodamine-oligosaccharide, also showed Crhp-dependent fluorescence in patches, which were identified as bud scars. In all three systems, binding of the fluorescent material to chitin was verified by chitinase digestion. Moreover, the cell wall reaction was inhibited by chitooligosaccharides. These results demonstrate that the Crh proteins act by transferring chitin chains to beta(1-6)glucan, with a newly observed high activity in the bud scar. The importance of transglycosylation for cell wall assembly is thus firmly established."
https://openalex.org/W2089250997,"Anaplerosis, the synthesis of citric acid cycle intermediates, by pancreatic beta cell mitochondria has been proposed to be as important for insulin secretion as mitochondrial energy production. However, studies designed to lower the rate of anaplerosis in the beta cell have been inconclusive. To test the hypothesis that anaplerosis is important for insulin secretion, we lowered the activity of pyruvate carboxylase (PC), the major enzyme of anaplerosis in the beta cell. Stable transfection of short hairpin RNA was used to generate a number of INS-1 832/13-derived cell lines with various levels of PC enzyme activity that retained normal levels of control enzymes, insulin content, and glucose oxidation. Glucose-induced insulin release was decreased in proportion to the decrease in PC activity. Insulin release in response to pyruvate alone, 2-aminobicyclo[2,2,1]heptane-2-carboxylic acid (BCH) plus glutamine, or methyl succinate plus β-hydroxybutyrate was also decreased in the PC knockdown cells. Consistent with a block at PC, the most PC-deficient cells showed a metabolic crossover point at PC with increased basal and/or glucose-stimulated pyruvate plus lactate and decreased malate and citrate. In addition, in BCH plus glutamine-stimulated PC knockdown cells, pyruvate plus lactate was increased, whereas citrate was severely decreased, and malate and aspartate were slightly decreased. The incorporation of 14C into lipid from [U-14C]glucose was decreased in the PC knockdown cells. The results confirm the central importance of PC and anaplerosis to generate metabolites from glucose that support insulin secretion and even suggest PC is important for insulin secretion stimulated by noncarbohydrate insulin secretagogues.

Glucose is the most potent physiological insulin secretagogue in the pancreatic beta cell, and it stimulates insulin secretion via its metabolism by aerobic glycolysis. Pyruvate, the terminal product of glycolysis, is metabolized in mitochondria to make ATP to power intracellular processes. However, somewhat surprisingly, in the beta cell, a large amount of glucose-derived pyruvate, equal to one-half the total pyruvate entering mitochondrial metabolism, is carboxylated in the pyruvate carboxylase reaction to form oxaloacetate (1MacDonald M.J.

Unlike mutations in the genes encoding the ATP-sensitive potassium channel, the sulfonylurea receptor and glucokinase, mutations in the pyruvate carboxylase gene do not cause a clinically detectable alteration in insulin secretion. In addition, there are only a few studies of insulin secretion in which the amount of pyruvate carboxylase was specifically lowered, and the results of these studies were inconclusive. In a study designed to validate a process to scan chromosomal regions in order to identify diabetes susceptibility loci, Antinozzi et al. (25Antinozzi P.A. Garcia-Diaz A. Hu C. Rothman J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, they did not report whether the level of the mRNA encoding pyruvate carboxylase or the activity of the enzyme was lowered by their treatment. A study by Jensen et al. (26Jensen M.V. Joseph J.W. Ilkayeva O. Burgess S. Lu D. Ronnebaum S.M. Odegaard M. Becker T.C. Sherry A.D. Newgard C.B. J. Biol.

This did not inhibit insulin release, and the lack of inhibition was attributed to a compensatory increase in the level of acetyl carnitine that could act as a substitute for acetyl-CoA, which is an essential activator of pyruvate carboxylase. Although phenylacetate, an inhibitor of pyruvate carboxylase, has been used in studies of insulin release, there are reasons to doubt its specificity. It is a weak inhibitor of the enzyme, and high concentrations of phenylacetate (5–10 mm) are necessary to achieve even partial inhibition of the enzyme and insulin release (17Farfari S. Schulz V. Corkey B. Prentki M. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 718-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 19Lu D. Mulder H. Zhao P. Burgess S.C. Jensen M.V. Kamzolova S. Newgard C.B. Sherry A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In addition, phenylacetate has been shown to inhibit many cellular processes not related to pyruvate carboxylase (27Shack S. Miller A. Liu L. Prasanna P. Thibault A. Samid D. Clin. Cancer Res. 1996; 2: 865-872PubMed Google Scholar, 28Samid D. Wells M. Greene M.E. Shen W. Palmer C.N. Thibault A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2000; 6: 933-941PubMed Google Scholar) and aromatic compounds at millimolar concentrations uncouple mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. In order to test the hypothesis that lowering pyruvate carboxylase could decrease secretagogue-induced insulin release, we generated cell lines from INS-1 832/13 cells that expressed shRNA targeted to various sites of the pyruvate carboxylase mRNA. This gave cell lines with various reductions in pyruvate carboxylase enzyme activity ranging up to a 90% reduction compared with the control cell lines. Decreases in insulin release induced by glucose and other secretagogues were correlated with the level of the enzyme. Malate, citrate, pyruvate, and lactate were measured in secretagogue-stimulated pyruvate carboxylase-deficient cells to discern whether a block at the pyruvate carboxylase reaction was present. In addition, the incorporation of 14C from [U-14C]glucose into lipid products was measured to determine whether lowering of the enzyme influenced the rate of formation of anaplerotic products. Materials—Chemicals were from Sigma in the highest purity available. [U-14C]glucose was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The parental INS-1 832/13 cell line was from Chris Newgard (29Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Generation Of Pyruvate Carboxylase Knockdown Cell Lines—The stably transfected control cell lines CHS and U6 were generated by transfection of INS-1 832/13 cells with pSilencer2.1-U6/Hygro negative control vector (Ambion) and pRNA-U6.1/Hygro (GenScript), respectively, and both cell lines were selected for hygromycin resistance. The first vector contains a 62-bp DNA fragment cloned into the BamHI/HindIII sites of pSilencer2.1-U6/Hygro GATCCACTACCGTTGTTATAGGTGTTCAAGAGACACCTATAACAACGGTAGTTTTTTGGAAA. The two 19-bp inverted repeats (underlined) express siRNA with limited homology to any known sequence in the human, mouse, and rat genomes. The vectors used for the expression of shRNAs were derived from pRNA-U6.1/Hygro, except in two cases the pSilencer2.1-U6/Hygro vector was used (cell lines PCX1 and PCX3). The pRNA-U6.1/Hygro vector contains a 12-bp sequence between the BamHI and the HindIII sites. This sequence was replaced with the 64- or 65-bp DNA inserts that express the various shRNAs. The DNA inserts were cloned into the BamHI and the HindIII sites downstream of the U6 promoter for stable expression of shRNAs that are processed in vitro to generate siRNA. The design of target sequences was performed using Web-based siRNA design engines (Table 1). The transfection of INS-1 832/13 cells was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) in 6-well tissue culture plates. Following transfection, the cells were incubated overnight without selection. Subsequently, the cells were grown in the presence of 150 μg/ml hygromycin in INS-1 tissue culture medium (RPMI 1640 medium (contains 11.1 mm glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 10 mm sodium Hepes buffer, pH 7.3 (23MacDonald M.J.

Pools of cells stably transfected with each shRNA vector directed against one pyruvate carboxylase mRNA target (Table 1) were used to study pyruvate carboxylase activity and insulin release. In an attempt to reduce pyruvate carboxylase activity further, two regions of the pyruvate carboxylase mRNA were targeted. Hygromycin-resistant cell lines that stably expressed shRNA against a single pyruvate carboxylase mRNA target were transfected with a pSilencer2.1-U6/Puro vector that expressed siRNA targeted against a second region of pyruvate carboxylase mRNA and would render the cells puromycin-resistant. The hygromycin-resistant cell lines PC118 and PC3064 were transfected with the pyruvate carboxylase gene target constructs containing the puromycin gene, and the cell lines were selected using 150 μg/ml hygromycin and 250 ng/ml puromycin. Cell lines were designated such that the first number refers to the pyruvate carboxylase mRNA target on the hygromycin-resistant vector and the second number refers to the pyruvate carboxylase mRNA target on the puromycin-resistant vector.TABLE 1Nucleotide sequences used to target the pyruvate carboxylase gene mRNACell lineNucleotide positionsTarget sequencePC118184-202GTAATGGTGGCCAACAGAGPCX1296-314GGCAGAAAGCTGATGAAGCPC352384-402CAAGGAGAATGGTGTAGATPC169387-405GGAGAATGGTGTAGATGCTPC701767-785TTGTGGAGAAATTCATTGAPC14221454-1472AGAATGT(G/T) CTCAACAACCACPC19712037-2055CGTGGTCTTCAAGTTCTGTPC19732038-2057GTGGTCTTCAAGTTCTGTGAPC28872953-2971GTTCCGTTCTAAGGTGCTAAPC30643130-3148GACTTCACGGCTACCTTTGPCX33291-3309GGTGTTCTTTGAACTCAAT Open table in a new tab Real Time PCR mRNA Quantification—Cells grown on 100-mm plates as described above were harvested at 60–80% confluence and washed twice with 10 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were then lysed on the plates using the RNeasy® minikit (Qiagen), and total RNA was prepared as recommended by the manufacturer. Equal amounts of RNA were reverse-transcribed from each cell line, using the RETRO-script™ kit (Ambion) and oligo(dT) primers. Primers used for the PCR were as follows. For the pyruvate carboxylase mRNA (NM_012744), a 123-bp PCR product was amplified using the primers 5′-GCACAACCATTGATTCGGATG-3′ and 5′-GCACAACCATTGATTCGGATG-3′; for ATP citrate lyase mRNA (NM_016987), a 169-bp PCR product was amplified using the primers 5′-ACCCAGAGGAAGCCTACATTGC-3′ and 5′-TTCGCCAGTTCGTTGACACC-3′; and for glutamate dehydrogenase mRNA (NM_012570), a 154-bp PCR product was amplified using the primers 5′-CGAGAAGCAGTTGACCAAATCC-3′ and 5′-CACTCCTCCAGCATTCAGGTAGAG-3′. All quantitative reverse transcription-PCRs were performed using the following amplification conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 58 °C for 20 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. Amplification and real time analysis were performed using the Syber Green-based MyiQ™ single-color real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). A standard curve prepared from dilutions of INS-1 832/13 cDNA was included with each run, and results for pyruvate carboxylase mRNA were expressed relative to expression of ATP citrate lyase mRNA or glutamate dehydrogenase mRNA. Insulin Release Studies—Insulin release from the cell lines derived from INS-1 832/13 cells and expressing shRNA targeted against the pyruvate carboxylase mRNA was measured as previously described (23MacDonald M.J.

One day before an insulin release experiment was to be performed, the glucose concentration in the tissue culture medium was reduced to 5 mm. Two hours before the experiment, the medium was replaced with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer, pH 7.3 (modified to contain 15 mm Hepes and 15 mm NaHCO3 with the NaCl concentration adjusted to maintain osmolarity at 310) containing 3 mm glucose and 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) (23MacDonald M.J.

Cells were washed once with the Krebs-Ringer Hepes BSA solution, and insulin release was studied in 1 ml of this same solution in the presence or absence of secretagogues. After 1 h at 37 °C, samples of incubation solution were collected and centrifuged to sediment any cells floating in the incubation solution. An aliquot of the supernatant fraction was removed and saved for insulin measurements by radioimmunoassay. The plates were then washed once with Krebs-Ringer solution containing no BSA, water was added to the plates, and the mixture containing the cells was removed and saved for estimation of total protein by the Bradford method using a dye reagent from Bio-Rad. Insulin Content of Cells—Cells from individual wells of a 24-well plate were suspended in 1 ml of 1 m acetic acid containing 0.1% BSA and sonicated for 10 s (29Hohmeier H.E. Mulder H. Chen G. Henkel-Rieger R. Prentki M. Newgard C.B. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). The mixture was diluted appropriately to estimate the insulin concentration by radioimmunoassay. Enzyme Activities—Pyruvate carboxylase and propionyl carboxylase activities were measured in a whole cell homogenate, and the activities of other enzymes were measured in the cytosol of cells prepared as previously described (4MacDonald M.J.

Briefly, cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and treated with 0.05% trypsin, 0.5 mm EDTA in Hepes-buffered saline solution, followed by RPMI 1640 tissue culture medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and suspended in KMSH solution (220 mm mannitol, 70 mm sucrose, and 5 mm potassium Hepes buffer, pH 7.5) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Pierce). The cell homogenate was obtained by two cycles of freezing at –80 °C and thawing with vigorous vortexing and pipetting the sample up and down. The cytosol was the supernatant fraction obtained from centrifuging the whole cell homogenate at 20,000 × g for 10 min. Pyruvate carboxylase enzyme activity was measured by a CO2 fixation assay in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm NaH14CO3, 8 mm pyruvate, 2 mm Na3ATP, 1.6 mm acetyl-CoA, 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 100 mm Tris-chloride buffer, pH 7.85, and 10 μl of whole cell homogenate in a final volume of 50 μl incubated at 37 °C for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 μl of 10% trichloroacetic acid, and after 1 h, 80 μ l of the mixture was removed and placed in a scintillation vial that was left open overnight to eliminate the unincorporated CO2. The next day, 10 ml of Biosafe scintillation mixture was added to the vial, and the carbon fixed was measured. Values from blank test tubes containing no pyruvate were subtracted from test tubes containing the complete reaction mixture to give the rate attributed to pyruvate carboxylase (31MacDonald M.J.

NAD(P)(H) levels were measured with slight modifications to the procedure of Queval and Noctor (40Queval G. Noctor G. Anal. Biochem. 2007; 363: 58-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5 ml of 0.5 m KOH in ethanol was added to each 100-mm plate of cells to extract NADH and NADPH, and 0.5 ml of 6% perchloric acid was added to a companion plate to extract NAD and NADP (41Bergmeyer H.U. Bergmeyer J. Grassl M. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis, Vol. VII. 3rd Ed. VCH, Weinheim, Germany1985: 261-267Google Scholar). Plates were placed at –80 °C for 5–10 min, the cells were then thawed and scraped into a Microfuge test tube, and plates were washed with an additional 0.5 ml of extraction solution. Test tubes were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant fractions were removed and neutralized to pH ∼7. Approximately 0.8 ml of the alkaline extract was neutralized with 0.6 ml of 0.5 m triethanolamine plus 0.5 m potassium phosphate, pH 6, and 0.9 ml of the perchloric acid extract was neutralized with about 0.15 ml of 30% KOH. Pyridine nucleotides were measured by enzymatic cycling in a reaction mixture containing 1 mm phenazine methosulfate, 0.14 mm dichloroindophenol, 1 mm EDTA, and 30 μl of extract in 50 mm sodium Hepes buffer, pH 7.5, in a final volume of 200 μl with 0.5 mm glucose 6-phosphate and 10 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase for NADP and NADPH and 7.5% ethanol and 1250 units/ml yeast alcohol dehydrogenase for NAD and NADH.

https://openalex.org/W2068585157,"Biochemical studies in the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, indicated that in addition to the pathway for synthesis of phosphatidylcholine from choline (CDP-choline pathway), the parasite synthesizes this major membrane phospholipid via an alternative pathway named the serine-decarboxylase-phosphoethanolamine-methyltransferase (SDPM) pathway using host serine and ethanolamine as precursors. However, the role the transmethylation of phosphatidylethanolamine plays in the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine and the importance of the SDPM pathway in the parasite's growth and survival remain unknown. Here, we provide genetic evidence that knock-out of the PfPMT gene encoding the phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase enzyme completely abrogates the biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine via the SDPM pathway. Lipid analysis in knock-out parasites revealed that unlike in mammalian and yeast cells, methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine to phosphatidylcholine does not occur in P. falciparum, thus making the SDPM and CDP-choline pathways the only routes for phosphatidylcholine biosynthesis in this organism. Interestingly, loss of PfPMT resulted in significant defects in parasite growth, multiplication, and viability, suggesting that this gene plays an important role in the pathogenesis of intraerythrocytic Plasmodium parasites.

The protozoan parasite Plasmodium falciparum is the causative agent of the most severe form of human malaria, resulting in 300–500 million cases and 1–3 million deaths per year (1World Health OrganizationWHO Tech. Rep. Ser. 2000; 892: 1-74Google Scholar). The pathogenic stages of P. falciparum are those that invade mature erythrocytes, which are devoid of internal organelles and incapable of de novo lipid biosynthesis. Despite this, P. falciparum undergoes dramatic morphological and metabolic developmental changes and asexually divides to form up to 36 new daughter cells within 48 h of invading a human erythrocyte (2Krishna S. Br. Med. J. 1997; 315: 730-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). This rapid multiplication of P. falciparum within host erythrocytes entails the active production of new plasma membranes in which phospholipids are major architectural and functional components.

Genome data predict that P. falciparum possesses enzymatic pathways for the synthesis of all the necessary phospholipids from precursors transported from host milieu, such as serine, choline, inositol, glycerol, and fatty acids (3Vial H.J. Ben Mamoun C. Sherman I.W. Molecular Approaches to Malaria. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.2005: 327-352Google Scholar, 4Holz G.G. Bull. W. H. O. 1977; 55: 237-248PubMed Google Scholar). The synthesis of PtdCho in P. falciparum takes place via two metabolic pathways, the CDP-choline pathway (Kennedy pathway) and the serine-decarboxylase-phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase (SDPM) pathway (Fig. 1). In the SDPM pathway, ethanolamine (formed by the decarboxylation of serine by a parasite serine decarboxylase) is converted into phosphoethanolamine. The latter serves as a precursor for the synthesis of PtdEtn through the CDP-ethanolamine pathway and for the synthesis of PtdCho through the SDPM/CDP-choline pathways. Serine is readily available in the parasite cytosol due to the active degradation of host hemoglobin as well as uptake from the host milieu (5Francis S.E. Banerjee R. Goldberg D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14961-14968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 6Kirk K. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 495-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The PfPMT gene in P. falciparum encodes the phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase that specifically methylates phosphoethanolamine to phosphocholine (p-Cho) via the SDPM pathway (7Pessi G. Kociubinski G. Mamoun C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6206-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 8Pessi G. Choi J.Y. Reynolds J.M. Voelker D.R. Mamoun C.B. J. Biol.

Future Lipidol. 2006; 1: 173-180Crossref Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). p-Cho is then utilized by the CDP-choline pathway to synthesize PtdCho. The CDP-choline pathway also utilizes p-Cho synthesized from choline. PfPMT is a member of the PEAMT family of phosphoethanolamine methyltransferases that are also found in worms, plants, and other protozoa (7Pessi G. Kociubinski G. Mamoun C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6206-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 8Pessi G. Choi J.Y. Reynolds J.M. Voelker D.R. Mamoun C.B. J. Biol.

The restricted phylogenetic distribution of this class of enzymes suggests that they could be potential targets for the development of drugs to treat malaria and other parasitic diseases. The physiological role PfPMT plays in parasite membrane lipid biogenesis and in the development and survival of intraerythrocytic P. falciparum is not fully understood. Here, we provide evidence that disruption of the PfPMT gene in P. falciparum completely abrogates the biosynthesis of PtdCho from serine and results in severe parasite growth and survival defects. Our findings show for the first time that the in vivo methylation of PtdEtn to PtdCho does not take place in P. falciparum, thus making the SDPM and CDP-choline pathways the main routes for PtdCho biosynthesis. Furthermore, the data define a novel role for PfPMT in the proliferation and survival of intraerythrocytic malaria parasites. Plasmid Construction and Parasite Transfection—The plasmid pRZ-TK-BSD2 (10El Bissati K. Zufferey R. Witola W.H. Carter N.S. Ullman B. Ben Mamoun C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 9286-9291Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) was used to construct the targeting vector pW-pfpmtΔ (Fig. 2). The pRZ-TK-BSD2 plasmid encompasses the positive selectable marker BSD (blasticidin S deaminase) (11Mamoun C.B. Gluzman I.Y. Goyard S. Beverley S.M. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8716-8720Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) from Aspergillus terreus that confers resistance to blasticidin and whose expression in P. falciparum is under the regulatory control of the PcDT (Plasmodium chabaudi DHFR/TS) promoter. The plasmid also harbors the negative marker TK (thymidine kinase) from herpes simplex that confers sensitivity to ganciclovir and whose expression is under the regulatory control of the P. falciparum CAM promoter. To construct the targeting vector pW-pfpmtΔ for PfPMT gene disruption, a 601-bp fragment (nucleotides 18–619 of the unspliced PfPMT gene sequence) (MAL13P1.214 PlasmoDB) was amplified by PCR and cloned at the HindIII/BlpI site upstream of the PcDT promoter in the pRZ-TK-BSD2 plasmid. A second PCR was used to amplify a 505-bp fragment (nucleotides 650–1155 of the unspliced PfPMT gene sequence) for directional cloning at the EcoRI/NarI site downstream of the HrpII terminator in the pRZ-TK-BSD2 plasmid. P. falciparum strain 3D7 was cultured in human red blood cells (RBCs) by the method of Trager and Jensen (12Trager W. Jensen J.B. Science. 1976; 193: 673-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (6185) Google Scholar). Parasite transfection was done as previously described (13Fidock D.A. Nomura T. Wellems T.E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 1140-1147Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). After transfection, the cultures were maintained for an initial 48 h without blasticidin, and, thereafter, the drug was introduced in the cultures at 2.5 μg/ml final concentration. Cultures were continuously supplemented with 200 μm choline. The overall knock-out strategy (Fig. 2A) involved a two-step process by which the chromosomal PfPMT locus was first disrupted with the BSD cassette, after double cross-over homologous recombination, followed by elimination of the episome by selecting against expression of the TK gene with ganciclovir, a subversive substrate of the TK enzyme. To avoid loss of the knock-out parasites within the population (in the event that the SDPM pathway is an essential route for PtdCho biosynthesis), transfected parasites were continuously cultured in the presence of 200 μm choline, a concentration of choline ∼20-fold greater than that present in human serum (14Zeisel S.H. Growdon J.H. Wurtman R.J. Magil S.G. Logue M. Neurology. 1980; 30: 1226-1229Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Zeisel S.H. J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 2000; 19: 528S-531SCrossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Transgenic parasites, selected on blasticidin and ganciclovir, were cloned by limiting dilution and genomic DNA from cloned parasites purified for molecular analysis using PCR and Southern and Western blotting to confirm the disruption of the PfPMT gene. PfPMT gene disruption at the chromosomal locus was analyzed using the primer pair PfPMT-F (5′-ATGACTTTGATTGAAAACTTAAACTCTG-3′) and PfPMT-R (5′-TTTGGTGGCCTTAAAATAACCCCATCTTTGCA-3′). A PfPMT add-back vector for pfpmtΔ complementation was generated by PCR amplification of the 801-bp full coding sequence of PfPMT from P. falciparum total cDNA. The fragment was directionally cloned at the XhoI site of a pHC1 plasmid downstream of the P. falciparum CAM promoter. The pHC1 vector harbors a Toxoplasma gondii dehydrofolate reductase gene that confers resistance to the selection drug, Pyrimethamine (16Crabb B.S. Triglia T. Waterkeyn J.G. Cowman A.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 90: 131-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Southern Hybridization—Genomic DNA was extracted from wild type and transfected parasites, as previously described (11Mamoun C.B. Gluzman I.Y. Goyard S. Beverley S.M. Goldberg D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8716-8720Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). About 2.5 μg of the genomic DNA was digested with HindIII, separated on a 1% agarose gel, and blotted onto a Nytran® SuperCharge nylon membrane (Whatman Schleicher and Schuell). Membranes were probed with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled PfPMT and BSD gene probes. Western Blot Analysis—Parasites were extracted from infected erythrocytes by treatment with 0.15% saponin and sonicated in PBS. The soluble fraction was separated on a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblotting was done using affinity-purified antibodies against PfPMT and the P. falciparum translation elongation factor-1α (PfEF-1α) as previously described (17Witola W.H. Pessi G. El Bissati K. Reynolds J.M. Mamoun C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21305-21311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—RNA was extracted from asynchronous parasites by TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Exactly 1 μg of total RNA was treated with DNase I (Invitrogen) to remove any contaminating DNA, followed by reverse transcription. PfPMT was amplified from total cDNA using the primer pair PfPMT-F and PfPMT-R. As a loading control, the cDNA of the PfTPXI gene encoding the P. falciparum thioredoxin peroxidase (PF14_0368 in PlasmoDB 4.4) was amplified. PfPMT Enzyme Activity Assay—Synchronous parasites were grown to 12% parasitemia and harvested at the trophozoite stage. Total extracts were prepared following sonication in extraction buffer (100 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 7.8, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm Na2EDTA, 10% glycerol (v/v)) and centrifugation. The reaction mixture contained 100 mm Hepes-KOH, pH 8.6, 2 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 2 mm S-adenosyl-l-methionine (AdoMet), 1 mm phosphoethanolamine, 80 μm [methyl-14C]AdoMet (400 nCi), and 50 μg of parasite protein extract in a total reaction volume of 100 μl. A blank reaction mixture lacked protein extract. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C and terminated by the addition of 1 ml of ice-cold water. The products of the methylation reaction were purified through a AG (H+) resin, following the method of Nuccio et al. (18Nuccio M.L. Ziemak M.J. Henry S.A. Weretilnyk E.A. Hanson A.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14095-14101Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Labeling Assays and Phospholipid Analysis—Synchronized parasites cultured in medium without choline at 2% hematocrit were grown to 10% parasitemia at the early trophozite stage. The parasitized erythrocytes were resuspended in fresh medium containing either 1.6 μCi of [14C]ethanolamine hydrochloride (51 mCi/mmol) or 0.1 μCi of [14C]choline chloride (57 mCi/mmol) and cultured for 12 h. The infected erythrocytes were washed twice with PBS, and the pellet from a 60-ml culture volume was resuspended in a 20× volume of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v). Lipids were extracted by the Folch method (19Folch J. Lees M. Sloane Stanley G.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1957; 226: 497-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the organic phase of the extract was evaporated and redissolved in 600 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1). The organic extract (150 μl) was fractionated by two-dimensional TLC on Silica Gel-60 20 × 20-cm plates (Merck). For the first dimension, a solvent containing chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide (84.5:45:6.5) was used. The second solvent was composed of chloroform/glacial acetic acid/methanol/water (90:30:6:2.6). Parasite Growth Assays—Synchronized parasites at early ring stage were seeded at 2% parasitemia and cultured in the presence of 0, 10, 50, 100, 200, or 500 μm choline chloride for 96 h. Giemsa smears of the cultures were prepared at time points of 0, 12, 18, 32, 42, 56, and 96 h of culture, and the parasite counts and morphological state were determined by light microscopy. Terminal Deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) Assay—The TUNEL kit (Roche Applied Science) was used to monitor cell survival following the manufacturer's instructions, with some modifications. Briefly, asynchronous cultures were grown to 10% parasitemia, and 1 ml of the culture aliquots was washed twice with PBS, and the cell number was adjusted to 1 × 106 cells/ml. Fixation was achieved by resuspending the cells in 2% paraformaldehyde solution in PBS and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The fixed cells were washed twice with PBS, resuspended in 100 μl of 0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% sodium citrate solution, and incubated for 2 min on ice. Cells were then washed twice in PBS and kept on ice until labeling. A positive control sample was prepared by incubating fixed and permeabilized wild type (3D7) cells with 3000 units/ml of DNase I for 15 min at room temperature, followed by two washes with phosphate-buffered saline. To label the cells, 50 μl of the TUNEL reaction mixture was added to the cell pellet and mixed gently. A negative control sample was included by treating fixed, permeabilized wild type (3D7) cells with the labeling solution in the absence of the terminal TdT enzyme. The reaction mixtures were incubated in the dark at 37 °C for 1 h and then washed twice in PBS and resuspended in 250 μl of PBS. Cells were analyzed by fluorescence microscopy at 525 nm with the fluorescein isothiocyanate filter. To confirm that TUNEL staining correspond to cell death, parasites were grown in medium containing either 100 nm chloroquine or 100 nm pyrimethamine for 24 h and then processed for the TUNEL assay as described above. Nuclei Counting by Spinning Disc Confocal Microscopy (SDCM)—Counting of nuclei by SDCM was done essentially as previously described for other strains of P. falciparum (20Gligorijevic B. Purdy K. Elliott D.A. Cooper R.A. Roepe P.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2008; 159: 7-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In brief, all cultures were first synchronized three times by 5% d-sorbitol treatment, since multiple synchronization treatments successively improve the ring/early trophozoite ratio (20Gligorijevic B. Purdy K. Elliott D.A. Cooper R.A. Roepe P.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2008; 159: 7-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Data were then routinely obtained 35–38 h after the last synchronization step, wherein segmented schizonts are clearly visible by light microscopy. We have previously described our customized SDCM apparatus in detail (20Gligorijevic B. Purdy K. Elliott D.A. Cooper R.A. Roepe P.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2008; 159: 7-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 21Gligorijevic B. McAllister R. Urbach J.S. Roepe P.D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12400-12410Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This instrument acquires “z stacks” for live cells at ∼210–220 nm resolution (x, y, and z) in less than 1 s, which eliminates blurring due to parasite movement within the infected RBC. Along with reduced photobleaching and improved deconvolution procedures (20Gligorijevic B. Purdy K. Elliott D.A. Cooper R.A. Roepe P.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2008; 159: 7-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 21Gligorijevic B. McAllister R. Urbach J.S. Roepe P.D. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 12400-12410Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), the method provides a reliable and convenient way to count nuclei for live intraerythrocytic schizonts using a Merzhauser motorized MS-2000 XY translation stage and an additional piezo table-optimized z-movement (5 mm/s over a range of 100 μm). Oil was DF-type (n = 1.515, low background fluorescence), and the camera was a Hamamatsu ORCA ER-cooled CCD with 1.3-megapixel full frame and 8.9 frames/s full rate. Excitation of SybrGreen-labeled nuclei (20Gligorijevic B. Purdy K. Elliott D.A. Cooper R.A. Roepe P.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2008; 159: 7-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) was with a Coherent Innova 300 I argon/krypton laser (300 milliwatts at 488 nm). Exposure was for 100 ms at 100 milliwatts laser power, and z-spacing was 200 nm (appropriate for iterative deconvolution as in Ref. 20Gligorijevic B. Purdy K. Elliott D.A. Cooper R.A. Roepe P.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2008; 159: 7-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar. After iterative deconvolution using experimentally derived point spread functions, the x, y resolution of fluorescence SDCM data is only slightly lower than that of classical LSCM confocal data (measured on our instrument to be 213 nm using 520 nm light). z stack data were transferred to a Dell mini tower customized with three 750-Gb RAID array hard drives, and restoration was done using an Imaris 5.0.1/AutoQuant X software package from Bitplane Inc. (Saint Paul, MN), as described (20Gligorijevic B. Purdy K. Elliott D.A. Cooper R.A. Roepe P.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2008; 159: 7-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). z-Series of optical sections were deconvolved using the MLE method and a fixed point spread function routine with 15 iterations. Point spread function were obtained by mixing subresolution (d = 0.17 μm) fluorescent beads in cell culture. Restored images were transferred to Imaris and sorted into freely rotating three-dimensional objects in the “Surpass” mode, and nuclei counts were done with the aid of the “Spots” routine, which locates fluorescence peaks in three-dimensional space at operator-defined contrast half-width and intensity. Assignment of three-dimensional peaks as due to nuclei was confirmed by eye and then done in a semiautomated fashion to average across >200 schizonts in each case. Counts were exported to Excel or SigmaPlot software 9.0 for further statistical analysis. Genetic Disruption of the PfPMT Gene in P. falciparum—To assess the physiological role of PfPMT in P. falciparum, we disrupted the PfPMT gene by homologous recombination. PCR analysis of genomic DNA from the cloned transgenic parasites demonstrated the replacement of the PfPMT gene by the BSD-containing targeting cassette in 10 individual clones. Southern blotting of HindIII-digested genomic DNA isolated from one clone (Fig. 2B) and using a 601-bp 5′-end PfPMT gene fragment probe (identical in sequence to that cloned in the pW-pfpmtΔ vector) showed the presence of 5.6- and 9.3-kb fragments in the pfpmtΔ and wild type parasites, respectively, confirming the disruption of the PfPMT gene locus in the pfpmtΔ parasites (Fig. 2, B and C). Additionally, probing with the BSD gene fragment revealed the expected 5.4-kb fragment in the pfpmtΔ parasites but not in the wild type (Fig. 2C), further confirming that gene replacement had occurred. To test the loss of PfPMT expression in the selected pfpmtΔ clone, reverse transcription-PCR analysis was performed using primers within the PfPMT open reading frame. PfPMT cDNA could be detected using wild type but not pfpmtΔ RNA (Fig. 2D). As a control, the expression of the PfTPX1 gene was detected in both wild type and knock-out parasites. Analysis of the loss of PfPMT expression by immunoblotting using affinity-purified anti-PfPMT antibodies (17Witola W.H. Pessi G. El Bissati K. Reynolds J.M. Mamoun C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 21305-21311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) showed that, although a 30 kDa PfPMT band was detectable in the wild type strain, there was no signal in the knock-out strain (Fig. 2E). As a loading control, antibodies raised against the parasite translation elongation factor, PfEF-1α (22Mamoun C.B. Goldberg D.E. Mol. Microbiol. 2001; 39: 973-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), were used, and the expected ∼49-kDa PfEF-1α band was found in both the wild type and pfpmtΔ strains (Fig. 2E). pfpmtΔ Parasites Lack PMT Activity and Cannot Synthesize PtdCho From Ethanolamine—To determine whether PfPMT encodes the only phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase activity of P. falciparum, the three-step methylation of phosphoethanolamine to phosphocholine and the intermediate products was examined in protein extracts from either wild type or pfpmtΔ parasites using radiolabeled AdoMet as a methyl donor. As a control, we constructed a pfpmtΔ+ PfPMT complemented strain, which expresses wild type PfPMT episomally in the pfpmtΔ strain. Whereas the formation of radiolabeled phosphocholine was readily detectable in reactions with extracts from the wild type and pfpmtΔ+ PfPMT strains, phosphocholine could not be detected in the reaction mixture containing extracts from the pfpmtΔ parasites (Fig. 3A). Together, these results confirmed the loss of PfPMT enzymatic activity in the pfpmtΔ parasites and demonstrated that PfPMT encodes the only phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase activity in P. falciparum. To determine how the loss of PfPMT affected SDPM-dependent synthesis of PtdCho, in vivo labeling assays with [14C]ethanolamine in the wild type, pfpmtΔ, and complemented strains were performed in medium lacking choline. Two-dimensional TLC analysis of the parasite phospholipids following incubation with [14C]ethanolamine revealed, as expected, the formation of radiolabeled PtdEtn in all three parasite strains (Fig. 3B, top panels). In contrast, the formation of radiolabeled PtdCho from [14C]ethanolamine was only detectable in the wild type and pfpmtΔ+ PfPMT parasites, not in the pfpmtΔ strain (Fig. 3B, top panels). Thus, disruption of PfPMT function results in a complete loss of the SDPM pathway. This result also demonstrates that P. falciparum, unlike mammalian and yeast cells, cannot form PtdCho from PtdEtn. Labeling with [14C]choline resulted in the incorporation of this substrate into PtdCho in all three strains (Fig. 3B, bottom panels), demonstrating that the CDP-choline pathway is not altered by the loss of PfPMT. Loss of PfPMT Results in Growth and Morphological Defects That Are Only Partially Complemented by Choline—To examine the importance of PfPMT in the P. falciparum intraerythrocytic life cycle, the growth rate of pfpmtΔ parasites during their intraerythrocytic development and multiplication was compared with that of the wild type and pfpmtΔ+ PfPMT strains. Since the SDPM and the CDP-choline pathways converge at the synthesis of phosphocholine from phosphoethanolamine and choline (Fig. 1), respectively, we envisaged that choline supplementation could complement any defects resulting from the loss of the PfPMT gene. The three strains were synchronized and cultured at 1% parasitemia in media containing increasing concentrations of choline for 48 h. Giemsa-stained parasite smears were analyzed by light microscopy (Fig. 4). Although similar parasite counts were found in the wild type and pfpmtΔ+ PfPMT strains, the parasitemia in the pfpmtΔ culture was reduced by at least 50% at choline concentrations of 0, 10, and 50 μm in the culture medium (Fig. 4A). The addition of choline at 200 or 500 μm (10- and 25-fold higher than the physiological level, respectively) had only a marginal effect on growth of the pfpmtΔ (Fig. 4A) (data not shown). Wild type and pfpmtΔ+ PfPMT parasites inoculated at 3% starting parasitemia and cultured for two consecutive generations in medium lacking choline increased their parasitemia to ∼35%, whereas pfpmtΔ parasites reached only 10% parasitemia (Fig. 4B) under the same conditions (RBCs contain residual choline that can support limited parasite growth). These results indicated that choline supplementation at physiological levels could not rescue the loss of PfPMT, although a marginal rescue effect was notable at concentrations that were at least 10-fold the physiological level. Microscopic analysis of highly synchronized cultures indicated that, although the wild type and the pfpmtΔ+ PfPMT strains progressed normally, the pfpmtΔ strain formed trophozoites and schizonts that were smaller in size and depicted a delayed progression rate (Fig. 4, C and D). Determination of the relative size of the mature schizonts by measuring the average RBC area occupied by the parasites showed that mature schizonts of the pfpmtΔ parasites occupied only about 33% of the RBC area, whereas their wild type and pfpmtΔ + PfPMT counterparts occupied ∼75% of the RBC area (Fig. 4E). pfpmtΔ Parasites Have Altered DNA Replication—The low number of daughter parasites produced during the intraerythrocytic life cycle of pfpmtΔ parasites could be due to a low number of nuclei produced during schizogony (and thus a low number of merozoites). Therefore, we quantified the number of nuclei from synchronized populations of live pfpmtΔ and pfpmtΔ+ PfPMT parasites under continuous perfusion using DNA-targeted fluorophores and SDCM. The complemented strain (Fig. 5A) showed a Gaussian distribution of numbers of new nuclei per schizont that is similar to that measured previously for wild type parasites (20Gligorijevic B. Purdy K. Elliott D.A. Cooper R.A. Roepe P.D. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2008; 159: 7-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In contrast, the pfpmtΔ strain grown in the absence of exogenous choline (Fig. 5B) showed a distinctly biphasic distribution of nuclei counts with the majority of schizonts showing a reduced number of nuclei consistent with microscopic analyses. Interestingly, when the pfpmtΔ strain was grown in the presence of exogenous choline (Fig. 5C), the distribution remained broadened but shifted to higher numbers of nuclei. These results suggest that efficient production of phosphocholine plays a role in the formation of new nuclei during schizogony. Similar results were obtained by flow cytometry (data not shown). pfpmtΔ Parasites Have Decreased Cell Viability—To assess the effect of PfPMT disruption on the viability of intraerythrocytic parasites, asynchronous wild type, pfpmtΔ, and pfpmtΔ + PfPMT parasites were analyzed by the TUNEL assay, which measures DNA fragmentation that occurs as an early event in cells undergoing cell death. Although a substantial number of pfpmtΔ parasites cultured in 0, 20, or 200 μm choline were positively s"

The currently accepted model of PC2-C consists of an EF-hand motif overlapping with a short coiled coil; however, this model fails to explain the mechanisms by which PC2 truncations C-terminal to this region lead to PKD. Moreover, direct PC2 binding to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, KIF3A, and TRPC1 requires residues in PC2-C outside this region. To address these discrepancies and investigate the role of PC2-C in PC2 function, we performed de novo molecular modeling and biophysical analysis. De novo molecular modeling of PC2-C using the ROBETTA server predicts two domains as follows: an EF-hand motif (PC2-EF) connected by a linker to a previously unidentified C-terminal coiled coil (PC2-CC). This model differs substantially from the current model and correlates with limited proteolysis, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectroscopy, N-terminal sequencing, and improved coiled coil prediction algorithms. PC2-C is elongated and oligomerizes through PC2-CC, as measured by analytical ultracentrifugation and size exclusion chromatography, whereas PC2-EF is globular and monomeric. We show that PC2-C and PC2-EF have micromolar affinity for calcium (Ca2+) by isothermal titration calorimetry and undergo Ca2+-induced conformational changes by circular dichroism. Mutation of predicted EF-hand loop residues in PC2 to alanine abolishes Ca2+ binding. Our results suggest that PC2-CC is involved in PC2 oligomerization, and PC2-EF is a Ca2+-sensitive switch. PKD-associated PC2 mutations are located in regions that may disrupt these functions, providing structural insight into how PC2 mutations lead to disease.

PKD-associated PC2 mutations are located in regions that may disrupt these functions, providing structural insight into how PC2 mutations lead to disease.

Most cases of PKD (>95%) are linked with mutations in the genes Pkd1 or Pkd2, which encode the membrane protein polycystin-1 (PC1) and the calcium (Ca2+)-permeable channel, polycystin-2 (PC2), respectively (2Somlo S.

PC1 and PC2 interact directly and co-localize to primary cilia where they are hypothesized to be necessary for a mechanosensory or chemosensory response that triggers a rise in intracellular Ca2+ (9Somlo S. Markowitz G.S. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2000; 9: 385-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Many aspects of PC2 function are mediated by the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail (PC2-C), including co-assembly with PC1 through the PC1 C-terminal cytoplasmic tail (10Tsiokas L. Kim E. Arnould T.

Two-thirds of pathogenic mutations in PC1 and >90% of pathogenic mutations in PC2 result in truncations of their C-terminal cytoplasmic regions and are predicted to abrogate interaction between the proteins. There are no structural data describing PC2, and current descriptions of PC2-C lack functional and biochemical information.The currently accepted domain model of PC2-C consists of an EF-hand motif overlapping with a short coiled coil (6Mochizuki T. Wu G. Hayashi T. Xenophontos S.L. Veldhuisen B. Saris J.J. Reynolds D.M. Cai Y. Gabow P.A. Pierides A. Kimberling W.J. Breuning M.H. Deltas C.C. Peters D.J. Somlo S.

Helical wheel projection of this purported coiled coil (Glu772–Leu796) shows that residues in positions “a” and “d” of the helix (i.e. the coiled coil interface) are hydrophilic or charged and would be unfavorable in a coiled coil interface (Fig. 1D). PKD-associated truncations have been identified outside of these proposed domains in PC2-C (Fig. 1F), suggesting that residues important for PC2 function are located in the truncated regions. Moreover, PC2 binds directly to several proteins, including the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (14Li Y. Wright J.M. Qian F. Germino G.G. Guggino W.B. J. Biol.

All of these interactions are dependent on residues C-terminal to the currently accepted domain organization of PC2-C. To address these discrepancies and to aid future studies into the molecular basis of PKD pathogenesis and progression, we constructed a validated structural model of PC2-C.We have determined a de novo molecular model of PC2-C using the ROBETTA server (21Chivian D. Kim D.E. Malmstrom L. Schonbrun J. Rohl C.A. Baker D. Proteins. 2005; 61: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 22Chivian D. Kim D.E. Malmstrom L. Bradley P. Robertson T. Murphy P.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W526-W531Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar) and validated characteristics of this model using biophysical and biochemical analysis. We show that PC2-C contains two domains, a single EF-hand motif (PC2-EF) connected by a linker to a coiled coil domain (PC2-CC). We propose that PC2-CC is the actual coiled coil domain that has been assumed in the literature. Our results suggest that PC2-CC is involved in PC2 oligomerization and that PC2-EF acts as a Ca2+-sensitive switch. PKD-associated PC2 truncation mutations are located in regions that would disrupt these functions, providing insight into how PC2 mutations may lead to disease.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESProtein Expression and Purification—Fragments of polycystin-2 are as follows. PC2-C (Ile704–Val968), PC2-EF (Asn720–Pro797), and PC2-CC (Gly828–His927) were PCR-amplified from human PC2 cDNA (obtained from S. Somlo, Yale University), cloned into pET-28 (a+) (Novagen), and transformed into BL21(DE3) CodonPlus RIL (Stratagene) for bacterial expression. Mutant variants of PC2-EF (PC2-EF-X-Z T771A/E774A) and PC2-CC (L842P, V846E, M849K, I853P, I856K, V846E/I856K, and M849K/V863E) were created using QuikChange multiple site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Cells were grown to OD595 ∼0.4 at 37 °C and then shifted to 18 °C after induction with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at ∼18 h. Cells were harvested and resuspended in Buffer A (20 mm Tris, 500 mm NaCl, pH 8.0), lysed by freeze thaw/sonication with lysozyme (∼1 mg/ml) (Sigma), and clarified by centrifugation. Supernatant was loaded onto a 1-ml HisTrap column (GE Healthcare). The column was washed with 30 column volumes of Buffer A and then with 10 column volumes of Buffer A + 50 mm imidazole. Purified polycystin-2 fragments were eluted in Buffer A + 500 mm imidazole and applied to a Superdex 200 SEC column equilibrated in Buffer A. PC2-CC was treated with thrombin (1 unit/mg) for all experiments to remove the His tag. PC2-C and PC2-EF contain an N-terminal His tag with the sequence “MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHM.”Molecular Modeling—PC2-C (Ile704–Val968) and PC2-EF (Asn720–Pro797) were submitted to the full-chain structure prediction server ROBETTA (21Chivian D. Kim D.E. Malmstrom L. Schonbrun J. Rohl C.A. Baker D. Proteins. 2005; 61: 157-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 22Chivian D. Kim D.E. Malmstrom L. Bradley P. Robertson T. Murphy P.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W526-W531Crossref PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar). Models were analyzed for secondary structure content using iMolTalk (24Diemand A.V. Scheib H. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W512-W516Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and visualized using PyMOL. Coordinates for the ROBETTA models are included as supplemental data. The ROBETTA model for PC2-C-(801–968) and PC2-EF-(719–800) were also ligated to create a theoretical model of PC2-C (supplemental Fig. 2). Coordinates for this theoretical model are available in the supplemental data file.Limited Proteolysis Domain Mapping—PC2-C was treated with trypsin (1:100 w/w) or proteinase K (1:10,000 w/w) in 25 mm Tris, 250 mm NaCl, pH 8.0. Reactions were quenched using proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Products were resolved on SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride, and bands sent for N-terminal sequencing (Tufts University Core Facility). Identical reaction products were sent for MALDI-MS (Tufts University Core Facility). MALDI-MS results were analyzed using FindPept (25Gattiker A. Bienvenut W.V. Bairoch A. Gasteiger E. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 1435-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar).Circular Dichroism—CD spectra (260–185 nm) were recorded on an AVIV 215 spectrophotometer (Lakewood, NJ) at 25 °C with 1-nm step size, 1-nm bandwidth, 3 s averaging time, and 1-mm path length. PC2-C and PC2-EF were stripped of Ca2+ with 100 mm EDTA. Protein concentrations were measured by A280 (extinction coefficients: 9970 m-1 cm-1 (PC2-C), 1490 m-1 cm-1 (PC2-EF), and 6990 m-1 cm-1 (PC2-CC)), and Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Samples were diluted in double distilled H2O and spectra recorded at 0.17 mg/ml (PC2-C), 0.10 mg/ml (PC2-EF), and 0.05 mg/ml (PC2-CC). PC2-C (0.17 mg/ml) and PC2-EF (0.10 mg/ml) spectra were also recorded in the presence of 5 mm Ca2+. Three spectra were averaged before processing. CD spectra were converted to mean residue ellipticity [θ] (degrees cm2 dmol-1 residue-1) using IgorCD in IgorPro. Spectra were base-line corrected by subtracting averaged data (250–260 nm). Secondary structure calculations were performed using DICHROWEB and CDSSTR (26Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2477) Google Scholar, 27Whitmore L.

Wallace B.A. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2002; 18: 211-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). PC2-C and PC2-EF spectra (260–190 nm) in the presence and absence of Ca2+ were fit with reference set 7, whereas PC2-CC spectra (260–185 nm) were fit with reference set 6 (26Sreerama N. Woody R.W. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 287: 252-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (2477) Google Scholar). Secondary structure values were compared with the secondary structure content of de novo models of PC2-C (Ile704–Val968), PC2-EF (Lys719–Met800), or PC2-CC (Gly827–His927), respectively.Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—Measurements were done on a VP ITC (MicroCal, Northampton, MA) instrument; PC2-C (208 μm) was in the cell, and Ca2+ (2.5 mm) was in the syringe. For PC2-EF (188 μm) and PC2-EF-X-Z (T771A/E774A) (180 μm), Ca2+ was 5 mm. Proteins were stripped of Ca2+ with 100 mm EDTA and desalted in 25 mm Tris, 250 mm NaCl, pH 7.5. 79 injections of 3 μl were made at 210-s intervals. Data were fit to a 1-site model using ORIGIN 7.0 (MicroCal), and dissociation constant (Kd), stoichiometry (n), and enthalpy (ΔH) of binding determined.Size Exclusion Chromatography—PC2-C, PC2-EF, or PC2-CC (0.5 ml each) was applied to a Superdex 200 analytical grade SEC column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 25 mm Tris, 250 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, at 0.1 ml/min. The column was calibrated using the following: thyroglobulin 670 kDa, bovine γ-globulin kDa 158, chicken ovalbumin 44 kDa, equine myoglobin 17 kDa, and vitamin B12 1.35 kDa (Bio-Rad). The distribution coefficient, KAV, was measured and plotted versus log (molecular weight): KAV = (Ve - Vo)/(Vt - Vo) where Ve = elution volume; Vo = column void volume; Vt = total volume. KAV was calculated for PC2-C (+Ca2+), PC2-C (-Ca2+) (following treatment with 100 mm EDTA), PC2-EF, and PC2-CC.Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed with a Beckman Optima XL-I at the Center for Analytical Ultracentrifugation of Macromolecular Assemblies (University of Texas Health Science Center, San Antonio, Dept. of Biochemistry). AUC experiments were analyzed with UltraScan version 9.5 (29Demeler B. Scott D.J. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Modern Analytical Ultracentrifugation: Techniques and Methods. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge2005: 210-229Google Scholar). Hydrodynamic corrections were made according Laue et al. (30Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1992: 90-125Google Scholar), as implemented in UltraScan. The partial specific volumes of PC2-EF, PC2-CC, and PC2-C were estimated according to Cohn and Edsall (31Cohn E.J. Edsall J.T. Proteins, Amino Acids, and Peptides as Ions and Dipolar Ions. Reinhold, New York1943Crossref Google Scholar), as implemented in UltraScan yielding 0.722, 0.732, and 0.717 cm3/g, respectively. Equilibrium data were fit to multiple models, and the best chosen based on fitting statistics and visual inspection of the residual run patterns. 2DSA and Monte Carlo analyses were calculated on a Linux Beowulf cluster at the Bioinformatics Core Facility, Department of Biochemistry, University of Texas, Health Science Center, San Antonio, and on Lonestar/Teragrid (Texas Advanced Computing Center, University of Texas, Austin). Samples were analyzed in a buffer containing 300 mm NaCl. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at 20 °C and 60,000 rpm. Absorbance samples were spun in two-channel Epon/charcoal centerpieces in the AN-60-TI rotor. Loading concentrations of 1.0 OD (optical density at 280 nm) for PC2-CC, 0.25 OD for PC2-EF, and 1.0 OD for PC2-C were scanned at 280 nm with 0.001-cm step size setting and no averaging, corresponding to 120 μm for PC2-CC (ϵ = 6970 OD280 mol-1 cm-1), 163 μm for PC2-EF (ϵ = 1280 OD280 mol-1 cm-1), and 87 μm for PC2-C (ϵ = 9530 OD280 mol-1 cm-1). Extinction coefficients were estimated according to Gill and von Hippel (32Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5022) Google Scholar). Velocity data were analyzed with 2DSA (33Brookes E. Boppana R.V. Demeler B. Proceedings of the 2006 ACM/IEEE Conference on Supercomputing, Tampa, FL, November 11–17, 2006.

The PC2-C model predicts an α-helical, two-domain elongated structure connected by a linker containing a known PC2 phosphorylation site (Ser812) (37Cai Y. Anyatonwu G. Okuhara D. Lee K.B. Yu Z. Onoe T. Mei C.L. Qian Q. Geng L. Wiztgall R. Ehrlich B.E. Somlo S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 19987-19995Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Domain 1 (∼Ile704–Ser794) consists of a globular α-helical bundle (PC2-EF), whereas domain 2 (∼Gly828–Val968) contains a striking ∼40-residue-long central α-helix (Tyr836–Lys876) characteristic of coiled coil-containing proteins (PC2-CC) (Fig. 1A). Unexpectedly, domain 1 was not modeled as an EF-hand motif in the top theoretical structure received as output from the ROBETTA server. Because residues believed to participate in Ca2+ binding were improperly positioned for Ca2+ coordination in this model, and the de novo protocol utilized in ROBETTA is optimized for single domain proteins, we submitted the sequence for the predicted EF-hand domain alone (Lys719–Met800) for de novo modeling to the ROBETTA server. Modeling the smaller PC2-EF fragment resulted in a canonical single EF-hand motif with a well defined Ca2+-binding site (Fig. 1C). The ROBETTA protocol does not attempt to predict or model Ca2+-binding sites; thus the presence of a credible Ca2+ coordination loop in our model is independent evidence in support of the presence of a Ca2+-binding EF-hand motif in PC2-C. Interestingly, a structural domain with similarities to a coiled coil (domain 2) was found C-terminal to the position of the purported coiled coil domain in the currently accepted model of PC2-C. To investigate the possibility that a previously undiscovered coiled coil motif is present in the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of PC2, the sequence of PC2-C was analyzed for coiled coil propensity using the program MARCOIL (38Delorenzi M. Speed T. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2002; 18: 617-625Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar) which contains an improved, more stringent prediction algorithm. The resulting output from MAR-COIL predicts that residues Phe839–Asp919 have a high probability to form a coiled coil (supplemental Fig. 3). Heptad repeat residues (a–d) were mapped and found to correspond to a hydrophobic stripe on the long α-helix in the PC2-CC model (Fig. 1, B and E and supplemental Fig. 1). Typically, a–d residues are hydrophobic and make up the coiled coil interface (39Lupas A.N. Gruber M. Adv. Protein Chem. 2005; 70: 37-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar).The results of our de novo modeling for the cytoplasmic tail of PC2 suggest that PC2-CC is the actual coiled coil domain assumed in the literature. Residues within PC2-CC are necessary for direct binding to PC2-interacting proteins (PC1, TRPC1, and KIF3A) and PC2-PC2 oligomerization (9Somlo S. Markowitz G.S. Curr. Opin. Nephrol.

Res. 2004; 37: 681-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Furthermore, PC2-CC includes the most C-terminal pathogenic PKD-associated truncation variant (R872X) (40Reynolds D.M. Hayashi T. Cai Y. Veldhuisen B. Watnick T.J. Lens X.M. Mochizuki T. Qian F. Maeda Y. Li L. Fossdal R. Coto E. Wu G. Breuning M.H. Germino G.G. Peters D.J. Somlo S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 2342-2351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This truncation product is unable to interact with the C terminus of PC1 (12Qian F. Germino F.J. Cai Y. Zhang X. Somlo S. Germino G.G. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar), leading to a plausible hypothesis for PKD pathogenesis. These modeling studies identify a previously unreported coiled coil domain within the C-terminal cytoplasmic tail of PC2, which may serve as an oligomerization interface ablated by PKD-associated truncations.Domain Mapping Using Limited Proteolysis Validates the Presence and Relative Positions of Two Domains within the C-terminal Tail of Polycystin-2—To test the validity of our de novo structural model, we mapped the domain structure of PC2-C using limited proteolysis experiments coupled with MALDI-MS and N-terminal sequencing. PC2-C (Ile704–Val968) was treated with trypsin or proteinase K to identify proteolytically resistant fragments under single hit kinetics (Fig. 2). Two proteolytically resistant bands from each reaction were analyzed by N-terminal sequencing and correspond to fragments that begin with the sequences: “ALVKL” (Ala711–Leu715) and “NTVDD” (Asn720–Asp724) from trypsin digestion and “SFPRS” (Ser804–Ser808) and “SSRRR” (Ser823–Arg827) from proteinase K digestion. Notably, both proteinase K cleavage sites occur within the predicted linker region of our PC2-C model. Given the broad substrate specificity of proteinase K, these results support the presence of an interdomain linker between residues Arg803 and His822. Identical proteolysis reaction products were analyzed by MALDI-MS and matched with fragments of the PC2-C sequence using the N-terminal sequencing results as a constraint, corresponding to Ala711–Pro797 and Gly828–His927. These results were obtained before modeling was complete because full chain automated structure prediction using the ROBETTA server can take several months. The residues corresponding to these PC2-C fragments were mapped onto our de novo model of PC2-C and overlap with the positions of the predicted domains, validating our two domain model and the position of the linker region (Fig. 1D). Using these results we generated PC2-EF (Asn720–Pro797) and PC2-CC (Gly828–His927) for biophysical analysis.FIGURE 2Limited proteolysis identifies two stable domains, PC2-EF and PC2-CC.

To test this, we compared the secondary structure content of the PC2-C model with values obtained by CD spectroscopy. CD spectra were recorded for PC2-C, PC2-EF, and PC2-CC and show each to contain high α-helical content in agreement with our modeling results (Fig. 3). Secondary structure content, calculated using DICHROWEB (27Whitmore L. Wallace B.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32: W668-W673Crossref PubMed Scopus (1967) Google Scholar), was compared with percentage α-helicity from our structural model of PC2-C for the entire model and for individual domains. Because the model of PC2-C suggested a Ca2+ binding domain, we also investigated the Ca2+ sensitivity of the conformation of PC2-C. PC2-C and PC2-EF spectra were recorded in the absence and presence of Ca2+. PC2-EF shows an increase from ∼27 to ∼45% α-helicity after Ca2+ addition, and PC2-C increases from ∼34 to ∼50% α-helicity with Ca2+. These values for Ca2+-bound PC2-C (∼50%) and PC2-EF (∼45%) correspond with our structural models of PC2-C (62%) and PC2-EF (51%). Secondary structure content calculated from CD spectra for PC2-CC (∼70% α-helix) is also in agreement with our structural model of the coiled coil domain (74%). CD thus validates the α-helical fold predicted by our model of PC2-C and suggests that Ca2+ binding induces a conformational change within the EF-hand domain.FIGURE 3CD of PC2-C, PC2-EF, and PC2-CC indicate high α-helical secondary structure content. CD spectra were recorded for PC2-C, PC2-EF, and PC2-CC, and secondary structure values were compared with the secondary structure content of the de novo models of PC2-C (Ile704–Val968) or PC2-EF (Lys719–Met800). CD spectra of PC2-C (A) or PC2-EF (B) were recorded in the presence (smooth line) and absence (dotte"

We hypothesized that Epac, a newly identified effector of cAMP, may play a role in intimal cushion formation (ICF) in the DA distinct from that of PKA. In the present study, we found that the levels of Epac1 and Epac2 mRNAs were significantly up-regulated in the rat DA during the perinatal period. A specific EP4 agonist, ONO-AE1-329, increased Rap1 activity in the presence of a PKA inhibitor, PKI-(14-22)-amide, in DA smooth muscle cells. 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP (O-Me-cAMP), a cAMP analog selective to Epac activator, promoted migration of DA smooth muscle cells (SMC) in a dose-dependent manner. Adenovirus-mediated Epac1 or Epac2 gene transfer further enhanced O-Me-cAMP-induced cell migration, although the effect of Epac1 overexpression on cell migration was stronger than that of Epac2. In addition, transfection of small interfering RNAs for Epac1, but not Epac2, significantly inhibited serum-mediated migration of DA SMCs. In the presence of O-Me-cAMP, actin stress fibers were well organized with enhanced focal adhesion, and cell shape was widely expanded. Adenovirus-mediated Epac1, but not Epac2 gene transfer, induced prominent ICF in the rat DA explants when compared with those with green fluorescent protein gene transfer. The thickness of intimal cushion became significantly greater (1.98-fold) in Epac1-overexpressed DA. O-Me-cAMP did not change hyaluronan production, although it decreased proliferation of DA SMCs. The present study demonstrated that Epac, especially Epac1, plays an important role in promoting SMC migration and thereby ICF in the rat DA.

Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) 3The abbreviations used are: PGE2, prostaglandin E2; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase A; DA, ductus arteriosus; PKI-(14-22)-amide, PKA inhibitor-(14-22)-amide; O-Me-cAMP, 8-pCPT-2′-O-Me-cAMP; pCTP-cAMP, 4-chloro-phenylthio)-adenosine 3′:5′-cyclic monophosphate cAMP; ICF, intimal cushion formation; HA, hyaluronic acid; SMC, smooth muscle cell; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-PCR; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; GFP, green fluorescent protein; siRNA, small interfering RNA. is the most potent vasodilatory lipid mediator in the ductus arteriosus (DA), a fetal arterial connection between the pulmonary artery and the descending aorta (1Smith G.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 35-58PubMed Google Scholar). PGE2 increases the intracellular concentration of cAMP, which activates cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA), resulting in vasodilation in the DA (1Smith G.C. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 35-58PubMed Google Scholar, 2Waleh N. Kajino H. Marrache A.M. Ginzinger D. Roman C. Seidner S.R. Moss T.J. Fouron J.C. Vazquez-Tello A. Chemtob S. Clyman R.I. Circulation. 2004; 110: 2326-2332Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In addition to its vasodilatory effect, our recent study has identified that chronic PGE2 stimulation has another essential effect on DA development, namely intimal cushion formation (ICF) (3Yokoyama U. Minamisawa S. Quan H. Ghatak S. Akaike T. Segi-Nishida E. Iwasaki S. Iwamoto M. Misra S. Tamura K. Hori H. Yokota S. Toole B.P. Sugimoto Y. Ishikawa Y. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 3026-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, via EP4, a predominant PGE2 receptor in the DA, the PGE2-cAMP-PKA stimulation up-regulates hyaluronic acid (HA) synthases, which increases HA production. Accumulation of HA then promotes smooth muscle cell (SMC) migration into the subendothelial layer to form intimal thickening. ICF then leads to luminal narrowing, helping adhesive occlusion of the vascular lumen and thus complete anatomical closure of the DA. A new target of cAMP, i.e. an exchange protein activated by cAMP, has recently been discovered; it is called Epac (4Bos J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Epac has been known to exhibit a distinct cAMP signaling pathway that is independent of PKA activation (4Bos J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Epac is a guanine nucleotide exchange protein that regulates the activity of small G proteins. There are two variants; Epac1 was found to be expressed in most tissues including the heart and blood vessels, whereas Epac2 is expressed in the adrenal gland and the brain (4Bos J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Various roles have been proposed for Epac, such as cell proliferation or transformation, but the role of the Epac signal in cardiovascular pathophysiology remains poorly understood. Since PGE2 accumulates intracellular cAMP in the DA during late gestation, it is reasonable to assume that PGE2 activates not only PKA but also Epac pathways in the DA. Therefore, we hypothesized that Epac played a role distinct from that of PKA in vascular remodeling in the DA, especially in the ICF process. Animals and Tissue—Timed-pregnant Wistar rats were purchased from Japan SLC, Inc. (Shizuoka, Japan). The DA was obtained from rat fetuses on the 19th day of gestation (preterm) and on the 21st day of gestation (term), as well as from neonates within 6 h after delivery. On the 19th day of gestation, the DA was still immature; it became mature on the 21st day of gestation. All animals were cared for in compliance with the guiding principles of the American Physiological Society. The experiments were approved by the Ethical Committee of Animal Experiments at the Yokohama City University School of Medicine. Quantitative Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—Isolation of total RNA, generation of cDNA, and quantitative RT-PCR analysis were performed as described previously (3Yokoyama U. Minamisawa S. Quan H. Ghatak S. Akaike T. Segi-Nishida E. Iwasaki S. Iwamoto M. Misra S. Tamura K. Hori H. Yokota S. Toole B.P. Sugimoto Y. Ishikawa Y. J. Clin.

Rat Epac1 primers (Rn00572463_m1) and TaqMan rodent GAPDH primers for PCR amplification were purchased from Applied Biosystems Inc. (Foster City, CA). For detection of human Epac1, the primers were used as described previously (6Ulucan C. Wang X. Baljinnyam E. Bai Y.Z. Okumura S. Sato M. Minamisawa S. Hirotani S. Ishikawa Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 293: H1662-H1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The sequences of rat Epac2 primers were 5′-atc aga tga tgc acg gat ga-3′ (forward) and 5′-aaa ctg ctg caa aag cac ct-3 (reverse) (Invitrogen). We confirmed that the sequence of the PCR product amplified by the rat Epac2 primers was only from Epac2 cDNA. We confirmed that both Epac1 and Epac2 primers were similarly efficient to amplify each PCR product. The abundance of each gene was determined relative to GAPDH. Primary Culture of Rat DA SMCs—Vascular SMCs in primary culture were obtained from the DA as described previously (3Yokoyama U. Minamisawa S. Quan H. Ghatak S. Akaike T. Segi-Nishida E. Iwasaki S.

The confluent cells between passages 4 and 6 were used in the experiments. Immunohistochemistry—Paraffin-embedded blocks containing DA tissues were prepared as described previously (5Yokoyama U.

Antibodies of Epac1 and Epac2 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology and Santa Cruz Biotechnology. There was little cross-reaction between Epac1 and Epac2 antibodies. Anti-αSMA antibody was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Anti-Ki67 and anti-von Willebrand factor antibodies were from Dako. DA SMCs cultured on 12-mm glass coverslips were serum-starved for 24 h and then stimulated for 1 h in medium alone (control) or with ONO-AE1-329 (an EP4-specific agonist, 10-8-10-6 m), O-Me-cAMP (an Epac-specific agonist, 30 μm), or pCPT-cAMP (a PKA-specific agonist, 500 μm). ONO-AE1-329 was kindly provided by Ono Pharmaceutical Inc. O-Me-cAMP and pCPT-cAMP were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Cells were then fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 10 min, washed twice with PBS, and permeabilized in 0.3% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. DA SMCs were washed twice with (0.1% Tween) in PBS and incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS for 20 min and then with an rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin antibody (Invitrogen) and paxillin antibody (BD Biosciences) for 16 h at 4 °C. Some specimens with a primary antibody were prepared without incubation as negative controls. An additional 60-min incubation was carried out with a secondary antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen). Nuclear staining was achieved with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Invitrogen). After two washes with 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS, coverslips were mounted for microscopic imaging. All incubation and wash steps were conducted at room temperature. Morphometric analyses were performed using Nikon TE2000-E (Tokyo, Japan). Rap1 Activation Assay—DA SMCs were grown to 70% confluency, serum-starved for 24 h, and then stimulated for 15 min in medium alone (control) or with ONO-AE1-329 (10-6 m), O-Me-cAMP (30 μm), pCPT-cAMP (500 μm), or a PKA inhibitor, PKI-(14-22)-amide (10-5 m). PKI-(14-22)-amide was purchased from Calbiochem. Rap1 activity was measured using EZ-Detect RAP1 activation kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol (6Ulucan C. Wang X. Baljinnyam E. Bai Y.Z. Okumura S. Sato M. Minamisawa S. Hirotani S. Ishikawa Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 293: H1662-H1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). SMC Migration Assay—The migration assay was performed using 24-well Transwell culture inserts with polycarbonate membranes (8-μm pores: Corning) as described previously (3Yokoyama U. Minamisawa S. Quan H. Ghatak S. Akaike T. Segi-Nishida E. Iwasaki S. Iwamoto M. Misra S. Tamura K. Hori H. Yokota S. Toole B.P. Sugimoto Y. Ishikawa Y. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 3026-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) with fibronectin coating. Adenovirus Construction—For construction of adenoviral vectors, full-length cDNA-encoding human Epac1 or Epac2 was cloned into an adenoviral vector by using an AdenoX adenovirus construction kit (Clontech). Both of the cDNAs were kindly provided by Dr. J. L. Bos at University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands. Adenovirus-mediated transduction was performed as described elsewhere (7Seta K. Nanamori M. Modrall J.G. Neubig R.R. Sadoshima J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 9268-9277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). As a control study, adenovirus vector harboring green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used at the same multiplicity of infection. RNA Interference (siRNA)—Two double-stranded 21-bp small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to the selected region of Epac1 cDNA or Epac2 cDNA were purchased from Ambion Inc. or Qiagen Inc., respectively. The antisense siRNA sequences targeting Epac1 were 5′-uug ugc aca ugc ucu gug g(tg)-3′ and 5′-gag aug acg gua cag gag c(tt)-3′. The antisense siRNA sequences targeting Epac2 were 5′-uag auu guc aau gaa ugu c(tt)-3′ and 5′-uaa aug acu aca uuc acg g(at)-3′. AllStars negative control siRNA (Qiagen) was used as a control nonsilencing siRNA. DA SMCs were serum-deprived and transfected with siRNA (100 pmol) using the Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. Cells were kept serum-free for an additional 24 h before the experiments. Quantitation of HA—The amount of HA in the cell culture supernatant was measured by a latex agglutination method, described previously (3Yokoyama U. Minamisawa S. Quan H. Ghatak S. Akaike T. Segi-Nishida E. Iwasaki S. Iwamoto M. Misra S. Tamura K. Hori H. Yokota S. Toole B.P. Sugimoto Y. Ishikawa Y. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 3026-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). SMC Proliferation Assay—The proliferation assay was performed using a measurement of [3H]thymidine incorporation as described previously (5Yokoyama U. Minamisawa S. Adachi-Akahane S. Akaike T. Naguro I. Funakoshi K. Iwamoto M. Nakagome M. Uemura N. Hori H. Yokota S. Ishikawa Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: H1660-1670Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Briefly, the DA SMCs were reseeded into a 24-well culture plate at an initial density of 1×105 cells/well for 24 h before serum starvation with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum. Cells were then incubated with or without O-Me-cAMP (50 μm) for 24 h in the starvation media before adding 1 μCi [3H]methyl thymidine (specific activity 5 Ci/mmol/liter; Amersham Biosciences International) for 4 h at 37 °C. Data obtained from triplicate wells were averaged. Organ Culture—DA organ culture was performed as described previously (3Yokoyama U. Minamisawa S. Quan H. Ghatak S. Akaike T. Segi-Nishida E. Iwasaki S. Iwamoto M. Misra S. Tamura K. Hori H. Yokota S. Toole B.P. Sugimoto Y. Ishikawa Y. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 3026-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Briefly, fetal arteries removed on the 19th day of gestation, including the DA, were infected for 2 h with 1.2 × 107 plaque-forming unit/ml of the Epac1, Epac2, or GFP adenovirus in 0.5% fetal calf serum containing Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium in humidified 5% CO2 and 95% ambient mixed air at 37 °C. After infection, the segments were cultured for up to 2 days, fixed in 10% buffered formalin, and embedded in paraffin. Morphometric analyses were performed using Win Roof version 5.0 software (Mitani Corp., Tokyo, Japan). Intimal cushion formation was defined as ((neointimal area)/(medial area)) × 100%. Statistical Analysis—Data are the means ± S.E. of independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed between two groups by unpaired Student's t test or unpaired t test with Welch correction and between multiple groups by one-way analysis of variance followed by Newman-Keuls' multiple comparison test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered significant. The Expression of Epac1 and Epac2 in the Rat DA—Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that the expression levels of Epac1 and Epac2 mRNAs increased significantly with development and reached their maximum on the day of birth (Fig. 1, A and B). The relative expression levels of Epac2 mRNA were approximately two times higher than those of Epac1 mRNA in a perinatal period. Immunohistological analysis showed that the expression patterns of Epac1 and Epac2 proteins in the rat DA were similar (Fig. 1C). They were faintly expressed in the smooth muscle layer of the immature DA on the 19th day of gestation. The stains of both Epac1 and Epac2 proteins became strong, especially in the endothelial and subendothelial layers, in the mature DA on the 21st day of gestation. After birth, the DA lumen was filled with endothelial cells and migrated SMCs (supplemental Fig. 1). Epac1 and Epac2 proteins were predominantly stained in these cells of the central core of the DA lumen. EP4 Stimulation with PKA Inhibition Increased Rap1 Activity—We examined whether PGE2-EP4 activates not only cAMP-PKA but also the cAMP-Epac pathway in DA SMCs by Rap1 activity assay. As expected, O-Me-cAMP, a cAMP analog selective to Epac (8Kang G. Joseph J.W. Chepurny O.G. Monaco M. Wheeler M.B. Bos J.L. Schwede F. Genieser H.G. Holz G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8279-8285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), strongly increased Rap1 activity, whereas pCPT-cAMP, a cAMP analog selective to PKA, did not (Fig. 2A). We found that the Epac-stimulated Rap1 activity was almost abolished by adding pCPT-cAMP, suggesting that PKA antagonized the effect of Epac on Rap1 activity. A selective EP4 agonist, ONO-AE1-329 (10-6 m), did not increase Rap1 activity (Fig. 2A). Then, we tested whether ONO-AE1-329 indeed did not activate the Epac-Rap1 pathway in DA SMCs or the effect was masked by simultaneous activation of PKA. In the presence of a PKA inhibitor, PKI-(14-22)-amide, ONO-AE1-329 increased Rap1 activity to a similar extent to O-Me-cAMP (Fig. 2B). These data indicated that EP4 activated not only cAMP-PKA but also cAMP-Epac pathway in DA SMCs. Epac Promoted DA SMC Migration—When DA SMCs were exposed to O-Me-cAMP for 4 h, O-Me-cAMP promoted DA SMC migration in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3A). On the contrary, acute stimulation (4 h) of pCPT-cAMP significantly inhibited DA SMC migration (Fig. 3A), which is consistent with previous studies on other vascular SMCs (9Indolfi C. Avvedimento E.V. Di Lorenzo E. Esposito G. Rapacciuolo A. Giuliano P. Grieco D. Cavuto L. Stingone A.M. Ciullo I. Condorelli G. Chiariello M. Nat. Med. 1997; 3: 775-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 10Sun J. Sui X. Bradbury J.A. Zeldin D.C. Conte M.S. Liao J.K. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1020-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). When DA SMCs were exposed to both O-Me-cAMP (50 μm) and pCPT-cAMP (500 μm) for 4 h, DA SMC migration was significantly inhibited, indicating that Epac-stimulated cell migration was completely antagonized by PKA stimulation. When Epac1 or Epac2 was overexpressed by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer using the same titer of adenoviral vectors, the effect of O-Me-cAMP on DA SMC migration was further enhanced when compared with control LacZ overexpression (Fig. 3B). However, the effect of Epac1 overexpression on cell migration was much stronger that that of Epac2 overexpression. Furthermore, since no selective Epac inhibitor is available so far, we prepared two different siRNAs for Epac1 or Epac2 to examine whether a decrease in the expression of Epac1 or Epac2 mRNA affects SMC migration. We found that transfection of both siRNAs for Epac1 or Epac2 significantly decreased the expression of Epac1 (31-40%) or Epac2 (48-54%), respectively (Fig. 4, A and B). It should be noted that the siRNAs for Epac1 did not change the expression of Epac2 mRNA and vice versa. An siRNA for Epac1 significantly decreased serum-mediated SMC migration (∼72%) (Fig. 4C), whereas that for Epac2 did not. Epac-enhanced Cytoskeletal Organization and Focal Adhesion in DA SMCs—Since cytoskeletal remodeling plays an important role in cell motility (11Gerthoffer W.T. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 607-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar), it is important to consider the effect of Epac on cytoskeletal organization and focal adhesion. We found that changes in cytoskeletal organization after Epac activation were quite different from those after PKA activation (Fig. 5). O-Me-cAMP induced a dramatic change in morphology within 60 min. Actin stress fibers were well organized, and cell shape was widely expanded, mimicking epithelial cells without branched extensions. On the other hand, pCPT-cAMP induced disassembly of actin stress fibers and long branching extensions. Cell surface area was significantly increased with Epac activation and significantly decreased with PKA activation (Fig. 5B). The expression of paxillin was mainly located in the edge of the control cells. In the presence of O-Me-cAMP, paxillin was more widely distributed not only in the edge of the cells but also on actin filaments as fibrous structures, consistent with a recent report showing co-localization of paxillin on actin stress fibers in an other cell (12Hu Y.L. Chien S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 357: 871-876Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In the presence of pCPT-cAMP, paxillin staining was localized around the nucleus. When cells were simultaneously stimulated by O-Me-cAMP and pCPT-cAMP, the cell surface area was normalized, although the staining pattern of actin filaments and paxillin in these cells was different from control cells and O-Me-cAMP- or pCPT-cAMP-stimulated cells. Interestingly, in the presence of ONO-AE1-329, DA SMCs displayed two distinct types of morphology (Fig. 6), which were different from the morphology of the cells stimulated simultaneously by O-Me-cAMP and pCPT-cAMP. PGE2 stimulation showed a similar result with ONO-AE1-329 (data not shown). In one type of DA SMC (P-type, indicated in Fig. 6 as a white arrow), the morphology was similar to that of PKA-stimulated cells, and in the other type (E-type, indicated in Fig. 6 as an arrowhead), the morphology of E-type DA SMCs could look either like control cells or like Epac-stimulated cells. In 146-190 cells examined, the ratio of P-type to E-type cells was 1: 0.97, 1: 0.74, and 1: 0.92 at the 10-8, 10-7, and 10-6 m concentrations of ONO-AE1-329, respectively. Cell surface area was greater in E-type cells than in P-type cells. A significant increase in cell surface area was observed in E-type cells in accordance with an increase in a concentration of ONO-AE1-329, but in P-type cells, there was no change in surface area. The expression of paxillin was more widely distributed throughout the E-type cells in accordance with an increase in a concentration of ONO-AE1-329. Epac Inhibited Cell Proliferation and Did Not Promote HA Production in DA SMCs—Our recent study showed that chronic PGE2-cAMP-PKA stimulation increased HA production, resulting in the promotion of DA SMC migration and proliferation and thus ICF (3Yokoyama U.

Investig. 2006; 116: 3026-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). It is now important to examine whether Epac regulates proliferation and HA production in DA SMCs. We found that O-Me-cAMP inhibited proliferation of rat DA SMCs (Fig. 7A). We also found that O-Me-cAMP did not change HA production in rat DA SMCs (Fig. 7B). These data indicated that Epac-promoted migration was independent of SMC proliferation and HA production. Epac1, but Not Epac2, Promoted ICF in the Rat DA—Finally, we investigated whether Epac1 and Epac2 indeed promoted ICF in the rat DA. Adenovirus-mediated Epac1 gene transfer induced prominent ICF in the rat DA explants, when compared with those with GFP gene transfer (Fig. 8A). However, Epac2 gene transfer did not. ICF, as determined by the ratio between neointimal area and medial area, became significantly greater in the Epac1-overexpressed DA, increasing by 1.98-fold (Fig. 8B), which suggests that Epac1 plays an important role in promoting neointimal thickening. Consistent with the findings in the previous section, both Epac1 and Epac2 overexpression did not increase the number of Ki67 positive cells and deposition of HA in DA explants (supplemental Fig. 2). Immunohistochemistry and quantitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed that the adenovirus-mediated Epac gene transfer indeed increased the expression of Epac in exo vivo DA (supplemental Fig. 3). The present study demonstrated that Epac promoted SMC migration and thus ICF in the rat DA. Since chronic cAMP-PKA stimulation promotes ICF in the rat DA (3Yokoyama U. Minamisawa S. Quan H. Ghatak S. Akaike T. Segi-Nishida E. Iwasaki S. Iwamoto M. Misra S. Tamura K. Hori H. Yokota S. Toole B.P. Sugimoto Y. Ishikawa Y. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 3026-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), both EP4-cAMP downstream targets, Epac and PKA, induced ICF in the DA. However, their molecular mechanisms are different. PKA promotes ICF through accumulation of HA production that accelerates migration and proliferation of DA SMCs. Therefore, chronic stimulation (>48 h) of PKA is required to accumulate HA production (3Yokoyama U. Minamisawa S. Quan H. Ghatak S. Akaike T. Segi-Nishida E. Iwasaki S. Iwamoto M. Misra S. Tamura K. Hori H. Yokota S. Toole B.P. Sugimoto Y. Ishikawa Y. J. Clin. Investig. 2006; 116: 3026-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Notably, the present study demonstrated that acute stimulation (4 h) of PKA inhibited DA SMC migration, which is consistent with the previous studies on other vascular SMCs (9Indolfi C. Avvedimento E.V. Di Lorenzo E. Esposito G. Rapacciuolo A. Giuliano P. Grieco D. Cavuto L. Stingone A.M. Ciullo I. Condorelli G. Chiariello M. Nat.

Res. 2002; 90: 1020-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Epac, on the other hand, promoted SMC migration within 4 h. Furthermore, Epac-promoted SMC migration was inhibited by PKA stimulation. Such an opposing effect of Epac and PKA has been reported in other types of cells (13Mei F.C. Qiao J. Tsygankova O.M. Meinkoth J.L. Quilliam L.A. Cheng X. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11497-11504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 14Yokoyama U. Patel H.H. Lai N.C. Aroonsakool N. Roth D.M. Insel P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 6386-6391Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Since Epac did not increase HA production in DA SMCs, Epac-promoted SMC migration was independent of HA. Besides, Epac stimulates Rap1, which is known to increase integrin-mediated cell adhesion to fibronectin (15Rangarajan S. Enserink J.M. Kuiperij H.B. de Rooij J. Price L.S. Schwede F. Bos J.L. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Along this line, we found that Epac activated Rap1 (Fig. 2) and focal adhesion (Fig. 5) in DA SMCs. Since fibronectin plays a critical role in promoting migration of DA SMCs (16Rabinovitch M. Semin. Perinatol. 1996; 20: 531-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), our data suggested that a Rap1-mediated increase in cell adhesion to fibronectin is responsible, at least in part, for Epac-promoted SMC migration. Until now, the functional differences between Epac1 and Epac2 have not been fully understood. The present study demonstrated that Epac1 promoted SMC migration and thus ICF stronger than Epac2, although the relative expression levels of endogenous Epac2 mRNA were approximately two times higher than those of Epac1 mRNA during a perinatal period when ICF develops. Although Epac2 overexpression significantly increased SMC migration, it did not promote ICF in the rat DA explants. We used LacZ overexpression for SMC migration and GFP overexpression for organ culture as control experiments, since it has been demonstrated that GFP increased cyclooxygenase-2 expression and increased PGE2 release in some cell types (17Zhang F. Hackett N.R. Lam G. Cheng J. Pergolizzi R. Luo L. Shmelkov S.V. Edelberg J. Crystal R.G. Rafii S. Blood. 2003; 102: 2115-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Therefore, one may assume that GFP-mediated PGE2 release promoted ICF in the DA explants, which may result in no difference between GFP and Epac2 overexpression in the present study. Anyway, using the same titer of adenoviral vectors, Epac1 overexpression promoted ICF stronger than Epac2 or GFP overexpression. Our previous study demonstrated that Epac1 and Epac2 mRNAs were up-regulated in isoproterenol-induced left ventricular hypertrophy, whereas only Epac1 was increased in pressure-overload-induced hypertrophy (6Ulucan C. Wang X. Baljinnyam E. Bai Y.Z. Okumura S. Sato M. Minamisawa S. Hirotani S. Ishikawa Y. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 293: H1662-H1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In addition, we have recently found that Epac1, but not Epac2, is up-regulated in the model of balloon-induced vascular injury. 4U. Yokoyama, S. Minamisawa, T. Akalke, M. Sata, and Y. Ishikawa, unpublished data. Since the physiological process of ICF in the DA closely resembles the pathological process of ICF caused by vascular injury or atherosclerosis in adult arteries (18Newby A.C. Zaltsman A.B. J. Pathol. 2000; 190: 300-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), Epac1 may play a central role in promoting ICF. Another important observation in this study is that DA SMCs displayed two distinct types of morphology when stimulated with an EP4 agonist, ONO-AE1-329 or PGE2. P-type cells were easily distinguished since they closely resembled PKA-stimulated cells in that they showed disassembly of actin stress fibers and long branching extensions. Since the morphology of E-type cells resembled Epac-stimulated cells or control cells, it was difficult to distinguish these three cell types from one another. It should be noted that Epac activation is required to obtain a concentration of an agonist of a G protein-coupled receptor that is higher than the concentration of PKA (4Bos J.L. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 733-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Therefore, we assumed that the ratio of Epac-stimulated cells should be increased in accordance with increases in the concentration of ONO-AE1-329 in the rat DA SMCs. Accordingly, the cell surface area and cell adhesion of E-type cells were increased in the presence of a high concentration of ONO-AE1-329 (10-6 m) in the rat DA SMCs. Interestingly, when cells were simultaneously stimulated by both PKA and Epac agonists, the cell surface area of cells was comparable with control cells, and the appearance of the cells was homogeneously similar among cells. They did not resemble P-type or E-type cells. Thus, simultaneous stimulation of PKA and Epac was different from stimulation of EP4. These data suggested that when cells are activated by EP4 stimulation, one pathway, PKA or Epac, may be dominantly activated in each cell. The molecular mechanism by which cells respond differently to PGE2-EP4 stimulation remains unknown. Further study is apparently required to identify what kind of switch makes these cells follow diverse pathways. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that Epac, which is up-regulated during the perinatal period, had an acute promoting effect on SMC migration and thus on ICF in the DA. The PGE2-EP4 signal activates the diverse cAMP pathways, both Epac and PKA, which synergistically promote ICF in the DA in two distinct ways, namely acute (Epac1-mediated) and chronic (PKA-mediated) (Fig. 9). Although further in-depth investigation will be required to understand the molecular mechanism of Epac-mediated ICF in the DA, our results imply that selective activation of Epac may serve as an alternative therapeutic strategy for patients with patent DA.

To better define the cellular function of the RecQ4 protein, we investigated the subcellular localization of RecQ4 upon treatment of cells with different DNA-damaging agents including UV irradiation, 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide, camptothecin, etoposide, hydroxyurea, and H(2)O(2). We found that RecQ4 formed discrete nuclear foci specifically in response to UV irradiation and 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide. We demonstrated that functional RecQ4 was required for the efficient removal of UV lesions and could rescue UV sensitivity of RecQ4-deficient Rothmund-Thomson syndrome cells. Furthermore, UV treatment also resulted in the colocalization of the nuclear foci formed with RecQ4 and xeroderma pigmentosum group A in human cells. Consistently, RecQ4 could directly interact with xeroderma pigmentosum group A, and this interaction was stimulated by UV irradiation. By fractionating whole cell extracts into cytoplasmic, soluble nuclear, and chromatin-bound fractions, we observed that RecQ4 protein bound more tightly to chromatin upon UV irradiation. Taken together, our findings suggest a role of RecQ4 in the repair of UV-induced DNA damages in human cells."

The DRF FHOD1 interacts with the Rho-GTPase Rac1 and mediates formation of actin stress fibers in its deregulated form; the physiologically relevant activities and molecular mechanisms of endogenous FHOD1, however, are still unknown. Here we report that FHOD1 physically associates via the N-terminal part of its FH2 domain with the central domain of ROCK1. Although FHOD1 does not affect the kinase activity of ROCK1, the DRF is an efficient substrate for phosphorylation by ROCK1. Co-expression of FHOD1 and ROCK1 results in the generation of nonapoptotic plasma membrane (PM) blebs, to which the DRF is efficiently recruited. Blebbing induced by FHOD1 and ROCK1 depends on F-actin integrity, the Rho-ROCK cascade, and Src activity and is reminiscent of the recently described PM blebs triggered by expression of Src homology 4 (SH4) domain PM targeting signals. Consistently, endogenous FHOD1 is required in SH4 domain expressing cells for efficient PM blebbing and rounded cell morphology in two-dimensional cultures or three-dimensional matrices, respectively. Efficient association of FHOD1 with ROCK1, as well as recruitment of the DRF to blebs, depends on Src activity, suggesting that the functional interaction between both proteins is regulated by Src.

These cytoskeletal reorganizations are primarily controlled by small Rho-GTPases and their downstream signaling cascades, resulting in distinct types of invaginations or protrusions, depending on the specific set of GTPases and effectors involved. In addition to well described PM protrusions, such as lamellipodia and filopodia (1Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5220) Google Scholar), under certain conditions, cells display on their surface highly dynamic rounded structures referred to as PM blebs (2Fackler O.T. Grosse R. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). PM blebbing results from local destabilization of the cortical actin meshwork that causes expansion of the PM due to the osmotic pressure of the cell interior. Following this expansion phase, blebs typically briefly remain static before local actin polymerization and actin-myosin contraction events are thought to guide retraction of the bleb (3Charras G.T.

PM blebbing has long been observed as an early event in apoptotic and necrotic processes (8Coleman M.L. Sahai E.A. Yeo M. Bosch M. Dewar A. Olson M.F. Nat.

More recently, nonapoptotic PM blebs were identified to play roles in distinct cellular processes, such as cytokine release, cytokinesis, embryonic stem cell motility, or cancer cell invasion (11Blaser H.

Although PM blebbing seems to follow the common overall scheme of expansion and retraction, mechanistic differences exist between distinct types of nonapoptotic PM blebs, in particular in regard to the stimulus that initiates blebbing. Typically, blebbing is induced in a three-dimensional environment by yet to be identified stimuli and is thought to facilitate directed cell movement of, for example, tumor or germ cells (11Blaser H. Reichman-Fried M. Castanon I. Dumstrei K. Marlow F.L. Kawakami K. Solnica-Krezel L. Heisenberg C.P. Raz E. Dev.

More amenable for molecular analysis, several model systems have been described in which cell blebbing is efficiently observed under two-dimensional cell culture conditions.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 625-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) can cause efficient PM blebbing. We recently reported that expression of SH4 membrane-targeting domains, corresponding to an 18-aa short peptide with N-terminal acylation that mediates PM targeting of, for example, Src kinase family members, also induces PM blebbing in two-dimensional as well as three-dimensional cultures. In addition, SH4 domain-induced blebbing correlates with accelerated cell invasion and rounded cell morphology in three-dimensional matrices (20Tournaviti S. Hannemann S. Terjung S. Kitzing T.M. Stegmayer C. Ritzerfeld J. Walther P. Grosse R. Nickel W. Fackler O.T. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3820-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Virtually all types of blebs analyzed so far share the dependence on the small GTPase Rho and its effector kinase ROCK (2Fackler O.T. Grosse R. J. Cell Biol. 2008; 181: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). SH4 domain blebbing additionally involves activity of the protooncogene Src. How precisely actin destabilization and subsequent polymerization is achieved, however, has not been addressed for individual types of blebbing. Of the four classes of actin nucleators described so far (Arp2/3 complex, Spire proteins, cordon-bleu, and formins), the last have been implicated in PM blebbing. Formins are modular proteins containing characteristic formin homology (FH) domains 1 and 2 that mediate binding to profilin as well as actin nucleation and bundling, respectively, and a less well defined FH3 domain. Actin nucleation mediated by formins results in unbranched filaments and occurs at the barbed end, at which the formin persists for protection from capping proteins (21Goode B.L. Eck M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 593-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). A subgroup of formin proteins, the Diaphanous-related formins (DRFs), contain an additional GTPase binding site and function in Rho-GTPase-regulated pathways (see Refs. 21Goode B.L. Eck M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2007; 76: 593-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar and 22Faix J. Grosse R. Dev. Cell. 2006; 10: 693-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar for a review). DRFs are autoinhibited by an intramolecular interaction between their C-terminal Diaphanous autoinhibitory domain (DAD) and the N terminus (23Alberts A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2824-2830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Activation of DRFs includes release of their autoinhibition, achieved by binding to the GTPase and/or other cellular interaction partners (24Liu W. Sato A. Khadka D. Bharti R. Diaz H. Runnels L.W. Habas R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2008; 105: 210-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 26Lammers M. Rose R. Scrima A. Wittinghofer A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4176-4187Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The mammalian DRF family comprises the Dia, Daam, FRL, and FHOD formins that are distinct in their GTPase specificity, tissue distribution, and biological function. Regarding PM blebbing, Dia1 (an interaction partner and regulator of Rho) and mDia2 (an interaction partner of Cdc42, RhoA, and Rif) were shown to be critical for bleb formation of MDA-MB-435 cancer cells in three-dimensional matrices and DIP-expressing fibroblasts in two-dimensional ones, respectively (15Kitzing T.M.

The role of, for example, Rac-interacting DRFs, such as FHOD1, in PM blebbing has not yet been addressed. FHOD1 is currently one of the least well understood DRFs on the molecular and cellular level. Although interacting with Rac1, a constitutively active FHOD1 variant induces formation of F-actin stress fibers in a Rho-ROCK-dependent manner and coordinates F-actin and microtubule networks (27Westendorf J.J.

Expression of active Rac1 recruits FHOD1 to the PM but seems insufficient for its activation (29Gasteier J.E. Madrid R. Krautkramer E. Schroder S. Muranyi W. Benichou S. Fackler O.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38902-38912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). FHOD1 shares typical features with other DRF family members, such as overall domain organization, multimerization, and autoinhibition (32Takeya R. Sumimoto H. J.

Chem. 2006; 281: 5084-5093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), but its GTPase interaction and FH3 domains are not well characterized. By which mechanism autoinhibition of FHOD1 is released and which biological activities endogenous full-length FHOD1 exerts is not entirely clear; however, recent results imply that phosphorylation of the FHOD1 DAD by ROCK facilitates activation of the DRF and stress fiber formation in epithelial cells (35Takeya R. Taniguchi K. Narumiya S. Sumimoto H. EMBO J. 2008; 27: 618-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 36Wang Y. El-Zaru M.R. Surks H.K. Mendelsohn M.E. J. Biol.

Here we describe that FHOD1 directly interacts with ROCK1 and find that both proteins synergize to promote PM blebbing. ROCK1/FHOD1-induced blebs displayed characteristics similar to the recently described blebbing induced by SH4 domains, including the requirement for Src activity. Interestingly, both endogenous FHOD1 and ROCK1 were required for efficient SH4 domain-induced blebbing. Since both physical and functional interactions between FHOD1 and ROCK1 required Src activity, these results imply that Src acts as key regulator of the functional interplay between FHOD1 and ROCK1 in SH4 domain-induced PM blebbing.

Constructs—The cDNA library from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells used in the yeast two-hybrid screen and cloned in the pGAD3S2X vector has been already described (38Peytavi R. Hong S.S.

Plasmids for expression of Myc-tagged ROCK1 and ROCK1-Δ3 were gifts from Shuh Narumiya (Kyoto University Faculty of Medicine). The expression constructs for fusion proteins of wild-type or activated GTPases as well as for N18-HASPB-GFP and N18-Yes-WT-GFP were described earlier (20Tournaviti S. Hannemann S. Terjung S.

The C3-GFP plasmid as well as expression plasmids for Myc-tagged GTPases were kindly provided by Stefan Offermanns (University of Heidelberg). Small interfering RNA oligonucleotides were purchased at MWG Biotech. Target sequences were FHOD1 (5′-UACCAGAGCUACAUCCUUAUU-3′) and nonspecific control (5′-AGGUAGUGUAAUCGCCUUGUU-3′). In Vitro Kinase Assay—Immunoprecipitation (IP) of Myc-tagged ROCK1 was performed as described previously (8Coleman M.L. Sahai E.A. Yeo M. Bosch M. Dewar A. Olson M.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar). Briefly, 250 μl of whole cell lysate derived from a 10-cm dish, which was grown with HeLa cells at 90% confluence were pretreated with 25 μl of Protein G-Sepharose beads (50% suspension) for 30 min. IP was performed by the addition of 7 μl of mouse anti-c-Myc antibody which was coupled to 30 μl of Protein G-Sepharose beads (50% suspension). For the kinase reaction, beads were suspended in 30 μl of kinase assay buffer (39Rauch S. Pulkkinen K. Saksela K. Fackler O.T. J. Virol. 2008; 82: 2818-2829Crossref Scopus (52) Google Scholar), containing 4 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 mm ATP, 3 or 5.6 μg of the substrates MLC (Sigma) or FHOD1, respectively, and either 5.5 μl of solvent or ROCK inhibitor (Y-27632; final concentration 10 μm) were added for specificity control. Following 30 min of shaking at 30 °C, the kinase reaction was stopped, subjected to separation by SDS-PAGE, and transferred by Western blotting to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane, which was finally incubated for 24 h with a photosensitive film. RNAi—For targeted knockdown of gene expression, double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides were transfected into target cells by lipofection. For transfection, 3.0 × 105 HeLa cells, 1.5 × 105 CHO cells, or 2 × 105 SYF plus c-Src cells were seeded in a 6-well format. On the following day, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline before Opti-MEM I (Invitrogen) was added as indicated. For transfection with Oligofectamine (HeLa cells; Invitrogen) or Lipofectamine 2000 (CHO and SYF + c-Src cells; Invitrogen), the transfection reagent and double-stranded RNA were separately resolved in Opti-MEM I, mixed, incubated for 10 min at room temperature, combined, and incubated again for 15 min at room temperature. Finally, the mixture was carefully added to the cells dropwise. After 3 h of incubation in the incubator, either 2-fold amounts of medium were added to the transfection solution (HeLa cells) or transfection solution was removed first before medium was added (CHO and SYF + c-Src cells). On the following day, cells were split and seeded on coverslips in a 6-well format. 48 h after the first transfection, cells were once more transfected as described above. Further transfections with plasmid DNA were subsequently performed, or expression of SH4 domains was induced by the addition of 1 μg/ml doxycycline. On the following day, cells were harvested for microscopic analysis and Western blot analysis of knockdown efficiency. Drug Treatment—HeLa, SYF-/-, or SYF + c-Src cells expressing ROCK1 either alone or in combination with FHOD1, N18-Yes-GFP, or N18-HASPB-GFP were synchronized in PM bleb formation. Therefore, membrane blebbing was efficiently abrogated by treatment with Y-27632 (SYF cells, 10 μm; HeLa cells, 90 μm) for 2 h. After extensive washing of the cells, de novo bleb formation was allowed for 3 h in medium containing a solvent control or Y-27632 (SYF cells, 10 μm; HeLa cells, 90 μm), 100 μm blebbistatin, 2 μm cytochalasin D, 25 μm latrunculin B, 384 μm nocodazole, or 1-10 μm PP1. Subsequently, the cells were fixed and stained for F-actin or α-tubulin (20Tournaviti S. Hannemann S. Terjung S. Kitzing T.M. Stegmayer C. Ritzerfeld J. Walther P. Grosse R. Nickel W. Fackler O.T. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 3820-3829Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 40Haller C. Rauch S. Fackler O.T. PLoS ONE. 2007; 2: e1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Drug treatment was controlled for efficient disruption of the targeted structures and reversibility within 3 h after wash out of the drug. Induction of Apoptosis—For induction of apoptosis, HeLa cells grown on coverslips were treated for 3 h with a combination of 50 μg/ml recombinant human tumor necrosis factor α and 5 μg/ml cycloheximide. Apoptotic HeLa cells were determined by an Annexin V-mediated surface-specific stain of externalized phosphatidylserine. Therefore, living cells were carefully washed with AB buffer (10 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2) and incubated with staining solution consisting of AB buffer containing fluorescently labeled Annexin V-Alexa-Fluor-568 at a dilution of 1:50 (v/v) for 15 min at room temperature. Subsequently, cells were fixed and stained for F-actin. Co-immunoprecipitation—To analyze FHOD1-ROCK1 association by co-immunoprecipitation, 2 × 106 COS-7 cells were co-transfected with 10 μg of the indicated plasmid DNA using the electroporation method. PP1, PP2, or PP3 was added to transfected cells for 4 h with PP1 and PP3 in normal conditions or overnight with PP2 at 37 °C in serum-starved conditions (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). 48 h after transfection, cells were lysed in assay buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 2 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl) containing 1% Triton for 30 min at 4 °C. The cleared lysate was precipitated with an anti-Myc antibody in the presence of protein G-Sepharose and incubated overnight at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by Western blotting. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—All of the procedures used to analyze interactions in the two-hybrid system were performed in the L40 yeast reporter strain as previously described in detail (41Benichou S. Bomsel M. Bodeus M. Durand H. Doute M. Letourneur F. Camonis J. Benarous R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30073-30076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The screening of the peripheral blood mononuclear cell cDNA library was performed using the WT LexA-FHOD1 fusion as bait. Plasmid DNA was rescued from positive clones and tested for specificity by retransformation into L40 with WT FHOD1 or the Ras extraneous target as described previously (41Benichou S. Bomsel M. Bodeus M. Durand H. Doute M. Letourneur F. Camonis J. Benarous R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30073-30076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Invasion Assay—For invasion assays, CHO-N18-HASPB-GFP cells were treated with control or FHOD1-specific RNAi, and SH4 domain expression was induced by the addition of doxycycline as described above. Transwell inserts (Greiner Bio-One) were coated with 50 μl of growth factor-reduced Matrigel (BD Biosciences). 8,500 cells were seeded and allowed to adhere before the lower chamber was filled with 1 ml of minimum Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum and the upper chamber was filled with 200 μl of medium. Invasion assays were stopped after 24 h, and cells were fixed with 8% paraformaldehyde and visualized using rhodamine-phalloidin and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Invasion assays were analyzed by taking z intervals of 5 μm with a ×20 objective using confocal microscopy (Leica TCS SP2). For quantification, the amount of invaded cells in each optical section with a distance of more than 10 μm from the membrane from nine randomly chosen fields was counted. For imaging cell morphology of invaded cells, single confocal sections were taken with a ×20 objective. ROCK1 and FHOD1 Physically Interact—In a search for FHOD1-interacting proteins, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using full-length FHOD1 as a bait and a human peripheral blood mononuclear cell cDNA library. One of the positive clones that interacted with FHOD1 was identified as a fragment encompassing aa 368-1357 of ROCK1, as indicated by growth on medium lacking histidine as well as activation of the β-galactosidase reporter gene (Fig. 1, A and B). The specificity of this interaction was validated by the lack of interaction of FHOD1 or ROCK1 with the Ras and Raf negative controls, respectively (Fig. 1B). The analysis of various FHOD1 fragments indicated that the constitutively active FHOD1ΔC (which lacks aa 1011-1164 and thus its autoregulation domain) can also interact with ROCK1 and mapped the ROCK1 interaction to the N-terminal region of the FHOD1 FH2 domain (aa 612-807) (Fig. 1C). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments from COS-7 cells expressing epitope-tagged ROCK1 and FHOD1 confirmed the specific association of the proteins (Fig. 1D). WT FHOD1 as well as FHOD1ΔC also associated efficiently with the constitutively active ROCK1Δ3 (aa 1-727) variant, indicating that aa 368-727 of ROCK1 are required for the association with FHOD1. Association with ROCK1 was also detected for FHOD1 variants lacking the entire FH1 domain (ΔFH1, lacking aa 570-610) or the core region of the FH2 domain in the C-terminal part (ΔFH2, lacking aa 807-866) (data not shown). Together, FHOD1 physically associates with ROCK1 in yeast and mammalian cells, and this interaction is governed by the N-terminal half of the FHOD1 FH2 domain and the central core region of ROCK1. FHOD1 and ROCK1 Synergize for Efficient PM Blebbing—To address potential functional consequences of the interaction of FHOD1 with ROCK1, both proteins were co-expressed in HeLa cells (Fig. 2). 24 h post-transfection with expression constructs for HA-tagged FHOD1 and Myc-tagged ROCK1, cells were fixed, stained for F-actin and the overexpressed proteins, and then analyzed by microscopy. Expectedly (8Coleman M.L. Sahai E.A. Yeo M. Bosch M. Dewar A. Olson M.F. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (975) Google Scholar, 9Sebbagh M. Renvoize C. Hamelin J. Riche N.

Such ROCK1-induced PM blebs revealed an enrichment of F-actin at the basis as well as at the outer rim (Fig. 2, A (b-d) and B). Similar structures were rarely observed in cells expressing FHOD1 alone (Fig. 2, e-h) that displayed the typical cytoplasmic localization of the DRF and normal F-actin organization or in vector-transfected control cells (13.3 ± 1.6% and 9.2 ± 3.0% of all cells, respectively). Co-expression of FHOD1 with ROCK1, however, markedly"
https://openalex.org/W1987169447,"Human guanylate binding protein-1 (GBP-1) is a large GTPase that is induced by inflammatory cytokines and acts antiangiogenically through the inhibition of endothelial cell proliferation and migration. In this study, we detected that GBP-1-expressing cells show a significantly reduced spreading and migration on fibronectin matrices. Investigating possible mechanisms of these effects, we found that integrin alpha(4) (ITGA4) was consistently up-regulated at both the RNA and protein level in GBP-1-expressing cell cultures. Inhibition of cell spreading and migration by GBP-1 was dependent on the binding of ITGA4 to fibronectin. The inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNF-alpha induced ITGA4 expression in HUVECs and inhibited spreading and migration. Knockdown of GBP-1 by shRNA abrogated inflammatory cytokine induced ITGA4 expression and restored spreading and migration capabilities of the cells. These results show that inhibition of endothelial cell spreading and migration by inflammatory cytokines is mediated by GBP-1 through induction of ITGA4 expression. Endothelial cell migration is a key process during angiogenesis. Therefore, ITGA4 may be a novel molecular target to modulate angiogenesis in human disease."
https://openalex.org/W2088991202,"Collagens are often considered a metazoan hallmark, with the fibril-forming fibrillar collagens present from sponges to human. From evolutionary studies, three fibrillar collagen clades (named A, B, and C) have been defined and shown to be present in mammals, whereas the emergence of the A and B clades predates the protostome/deuterostome split. Moreover, several C clade fibrillar collagen chains are present in some invertebrate deuterostome genomes but not in protostomes whose genomes have been sequenced. The newly sequenced genomes of the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis, the demosponge Amphimedon queenslandica, and the cnidarians Hydra magnipapillata (Hydra) and Nematostella vectensis (sea anemone) allow us to have a better understanding of the origin and evolution of fibrillar collagens. Analysis of these genomes suggests that an ancestral fibrillar collagen gene arose at the dawn of the Metazoa, before the divergence of sponge and eumetazoan lineages. The duplication events leading to the formation of the three fibrillar collagen clades (A, B, and C) occurred before the eumetazoan radiation. Interestingly, only the B clade fibrillar collagens preserved their characteristic modular structure from sponge to human.

Like all collagens, the fibrillar molecules are made of three α chains, which can either be identical or result from a combination of two or three genetically distinct α chains. Each α chain consists of a major uninterrupted triple helical or collagenous domain made up of ∼338 Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplets, which is flanked by two noncollagenous regions, the N- and C-propeptides. During the maturation of procollagens into collagen molecules, the two propeptides are generally cleaved by specific proteinases yielding processed molecules consisting of an ∼300-nm-long rod-like structure, representing the triple helix, flanked by short noncollagenous segments, the N- and C-telopeptides. Once processed, these fibrillar collagen molecules are involved in the formation of the well known cross-striated fibrils. In mammals, the fibrillar collagens involved in the formation of cross-striated fibrils are types I–III, V, and XI. These fibrils are usually heterotypic structures, consisting of one quantitatively minor (V or XI) and one or two quantitatively major (I–III) types of fibrillar collagen. Fibrils present in cartilage, which are constructed with type II and XI collagens, can be distinguished from those located in noncartilaginous tissues, which include type I, III, and V collagens. More recently, it has been shown that a newly characterized fibrillar collagen, type XXVII, is involved in the formation of thin nonstriated fibrils (11Hjorten R. Hansen U. Underwood R.A. Telfer H.E.

In this report, we have studied the evolution of fibrillar collagens by taking advantage of the publicly available genome data from the sponge Amphimedon queenslandica (formerly classified as Reniera sp.) and the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. We demonstrate that the formation of an ancestral B clade fibrillar collagen chain predated the eumetazoan radiation. Moreover, demosponge and cnidarian data suggest that although the emergence of the three fibrillar collagen clades occurred early in evolution, only the B clade preserves its characteristic modular structure in modern metazoans, from sponges to humans. Data Base Searching—Sequences from metazoan fibrillar collagen chains used in this study were obtained either from the European Bioinformatics Institute, from previous work on mosquito, honeybee, and ascidian collagens (17Aouacheria A.

Chem. 2004; 279: 47711-47719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), or from blast searches in sponge and cnidarian genomes. To identify fibrillar collagens in early branching metazoans, different approaches were used. For the demosponge A. queenslandica, simple reads from whole genome shotgun sequencing available in Trace Archive data bases at National Center for Biotechnology Information were mined with Blast using sequences encoding C-propeptides and triple helix from different sources. Each read isolated by this approach and its mate were used to construct contigs by repeating several cycles of blast analysis and contig assembly. Thus, this strategy permitted us to assemble five genomic contigs and to characterize seven distinct genes encoding fibrillar collagen chains (termed Amq1α to Amq7α). Each contig sequence was checked by compiling all of the overlapping whole genome shotgun reads, the coverage being greater than 4. Gene structures were (i) predicted by using the ab initio program GENSCAN (23Burge C. Karlin S. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 268: 78-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (3098) Google Scholar) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and (ii) completed by careful examination of the open reading frame and by matching these assemblies with existing ESTs. Several ESTs covering part of the coding region were obtained for Amq1α (CAYH1651 and CAYI6544), Amq2α (CABF4997, CAYH5770, CAYI7575, and CAYI5900), Amq3α (CABF3931, CAYH3995, CAYH3529, CAYH6239, CAYH4772, and CABF22710), Amq4α (CAYI5983, CAYH5842, and CAYI1569), Amq5α (CAYH3025, CAYI6261, CAYI7211, and CAYI7901), Amq6α (CABF3357, CAYH6535, and CAYI9396), and Amq7α (CAYI8810 and CAYI1553). A. queenslandica ESTs can be downloaded from the Ensembl Trace Server. For the cnidarian Hydra magnipapillata, the same approach was used to identify orthologous genes of Hydra vulgaris, Hcol1, Hcol2, Hcol3, and Hcol5 (9Zhang X. Boot-Handford R.P. Huxley-Jones J.

Several ESTs covering part of the coding region were obtained for H. magnipapillata Hcol1 (DN602947, DN253482, DT620184, D612454, DN603678, CCF658308, DR435484, and DT613951), Hcol2 (DN243434, CX832112, CX835856, DN812915, DT616768, DT609283, and DT606480), Hcol3 (DN636048 and DN811440), and Hcol5 (CX770252, DN603429, DN815968, DT616007, DN810685, and CF675546). For the recently completed genomes of the cnidarian N. vectensis and the sea urchin Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, Blast analysis was carried out using Nematostella (evodevo.bu.edu/stellabase/) and sea urchin servers. This allowed us to identify eight fibrillar collagen genes in Nematostella (called Nve1α to Nve8α) and the Strongylocentrotus ortholog of the Paracentrotus lividus COLP6α gene (17Aouacheria A.

ESTs covering part of the coding region were obtained for Nve1α (CAGN4739 and CAGN8651), Nve3α (CAGN3324), Nve4α (CAGN8932), Nve5α (CAGN9683), Nve7α (DV089101), and Nve8α (CAGF11976). The accession numbers, species abbreviations, and sources are compiled in Table 1. The modular architecture of the fibrillar collagen chains has been analyzed using the Smart server (24Schultz J.

Alignment and Evolutionary Analysis—The major triple helix of metazoan fibrillar collagen chains were first aligned using ClustalW (29Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56003) Google Scholar) with the PAM alignment matrix at the European Bioinformatics Institute. The resulting initial alignments were manually improved using the SeaView alignment editor (30Galtier N. Gouy M. Gautier C. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 543-548PubMed Google Scholar) and were scanned using the RASCAL component (31Thompson J.D. Thierry J.C. Poch O. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1155-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) of PipeAlign, a toolkit for protein family analysis. Neighbor-joining (NJ), maximum likelihood (ML), and Bayesian phylogenetic analyses were performed on the validated multiple alignments. NJ trees were determined using the Phylo win program (30Galtier N. Gouy M. Gautier C. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 543-548PubMed Google Scholar). NJ bootstrap support was based on 1000 replicates using SEQBOOT and CONSENSE (majority rule extended) of the PHYLIP package (32Felsenstein J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 418-427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate data replicates and consensus trees, respectively. The PHYML v2.4.4 algorithm (33Guindon S. Lethiec F. Duroux P. Gascuel O. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: W557-W559Crossref PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar) was applied for the ML analyses, under the WAG amino acid substitution model and with 100 bootstrapped data sets using the PhyML Online server. Bayesian analysis was carried out as implemented in MrBayes 3.1.2 (34Ronquist F. Huelsenbeck J.P. Bioinformatics. 2003; 19: 1572-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (25494) Google Scholar, 35Huelsenbeck J.P. Ronquist F. Bioinformatics. 2001; 17: 754-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (19396) Google Scholar) with a mixed amino acid model incorporating invariant sites and gamma parameter. Analyses in MrBayes were conducted using default settings, with two parallel runs of one million generations each, using four chains and a sample frequency of 100. Likelihoods of Bayesian analyses converged after the initial 21,000 generations. We therefore discarded the initial 210 trees from each of the two parallel runs and computed posterior probabilities from the remaining trees. The standard deviation of split frequencies after 1 million generations was below 0.01. The illustrations were drawn using the TreeView program (36Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar) and then annotated using Adobe Illustrator. In the absence of a good outgroup, some trees were rooted using the midpoint rooting method and the retree editor from the PHYLIP package (32Felsenstein J. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 418-427Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Midpoint rooting places the root at the middle of the longest path between the two most distantly related taxa. Demosponge and Cnidarian Fibrillar Collagen Diversity—Aiming to understand the early evolution of fibrillar collagens, we searched the genomes and ESTs of one demosponge and two cnidarians for genes possessing triple helix and C-propeptide sequences similar to Hydra and human fibrillar collagens. This survey led to the characterization of seven fibrillar collagen α chains in the demosponge A. queenslandica, named Amq1α to Amq7α, and eight fibrillar collagen α chains in the sea anemone N. vectensis, named Nve1α to Nve8α. For H. magnipapillata, we could detect only the complete major triple helical sequences for the α chains orthologous to those previously characterized in H. vulgaris (Hcol1, Hcol2, Hcol3, and Hcol5) (9Zhang X. Boot-Handford R.P. Huxley-Jones J. Forse L.N. Mould A.P. Robertson D.L. Li L. Athiyal M. Sarras Jr., M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6792-6802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The sponge and cnidarian α chains have the general modular structure of eumetazoan fibrillar collagens, i.e. a major triple helix flanked by the N- and C-propeptides (Fig. 1). Parts of the primary structure of the sponge fibrillar collagens (mostly the N terminus) were deduced from reading frame predictions (see “Experimental Procedures” and Fig. 1B). For this reason, the mRNA sequences encoding N-propeptide domain of sponge chains Amq1α, Amq3α, Amq5α, Amq6α and Amq7α were amplified by RT-PCR to confirm our predictions and to analyze the expression of the related collagen genes throughout the life cycle of A. queenslandica (Fig. 2). Most of these genes, specifically Amq1α, Amq3α, Amq5α, and Amq7α, are expressed throughout the sponge life cycle. Among these genes, Amq1α and Amq3α have higher expression levels during metamorphosis than other stages, whereas Amq7α has lower expression levels (barely detectable) during this period. In contrast, Amq5α seems to be more highly expressed during embryogenesis and in the larva, with levels dropping off during metamorphosis and in adults. The last gene, Amq6α, does not appear to be expressed in sponge adults.FIGURE 2Gene-specific RT-PCR of 5 collagen genes during the Amphimedon life cycle. Columns correspond to the different stages. E, embryogenesis; L, larva; M, metamorphosis; A, adult.

The first group includes fibrillar collagen chains that have an N-propeptide restricted to a minor triple helix (Amq1α, Amq3α, Amq4α, and Hydra Hcol1), a situation observed in some A clade members such as mammalian proα2(I) and sea urchin 1α chains (37Exposito J.Y. D'Alessio M. Solursh M. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15559-15562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, Amq1α appears to be the ortholog of the E. mülleri Emu1α chain with two glycine substitutions and one Gly-Xaa-Yaa-Zaa imperfection in identical positions (Fig. 1B). The second group comprises cnidarian α chains possessing WAP modules in their N-propeptide (Nve1α, Nve2α, Nve3α, Hcol2, and Hcol3; Fig. 1C and Ref. 9Zhang X. Boot-Handford R.P. Huxley-Jones J. Forse L.N. Mould A.P. Robertson D.L. Li L. Athiyal M. Sarras Jr., M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6792-6802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It should be noted that despite the high level of amino acid identity between fibrillar collagens of the two Hydra species (close to 100%), two differences were observed for two collagen genes. First, the major triple helix of H. magnipapillata Hcol3 is comprised of 1023 residues instead of 969 amino acids for the H. vulgaris Hcol3 chain. In H. magnipapillata, the additional 54 residues are encoded by a 162-bp exon (supplemental Fig. S1A), suggesting that the discrepancy between these two species results from (i) an alternative splicing event in H. vulgaris, (ii) the loss of this exon in H. vulgaris, or (iii) a cloning artifact in the cDNA characterized in the H. vulgaris study. Second, the H. magnipapillata Hcol2 fibrillar collagen chain possesses one less Gly-Xaa-Yaa triplet in the main collagenous domain compared with the H. vulgaris chain. Hence, one of the two GEQ triplets (31st or 32nd of the major triple helix) present in the H. vulgaris Hcol2 chain is absent from H. magnipapillata (supplemental Fig. S1B). In the third group, which includes sponge Amq5α, Amq6α, and Amq7α and sea anemone Nve7α and Nve8α collagen chains (Fig. 1), we noted the presence of a large noncollagenous domain in their N-propeptide. From SMART analyses, this noncollagenous domain clearly corresponds to a TSPN module for Amq5α and Nve7α. As shown in Table 1, the TSPN module of sea anemone Nve7α and sponge Amq5α chains have E value scores comparable with those obtained with bilaterian B clade and C clade collagen TSPN modules, respectively. From multiple alignments (Fig. 3 and Table 2), the TSPN domain of Amq5α and Nve7α share on average 18 and 30% of identity with comparable modules of human B clade members, respectively. For the other sponge (Amq6α and Amq7α) and sea anemone (Nve8α) chains in this group, the large noncollagenous domain might also correspond to a TSPN module (Table 1), although the E values for the TSPN modules are not significant in SMART. The peculiar location of this noncollagenous domain in their N-propeptide strongly supports that these sequences are TSPN modules. This result is in agreement with poor identity observed for this module between B and C clade members or diploblast α chains and B/C clade fibrillar collagens (Table 2 and supplemental Fig. S2, for multiple alignment analysis). Based on the modular structure of their N-propeptide, Amq5α, Amq6α, and Nve7α are B clade members (they contain a TSPN module and a minor triple helix), whereas Amq7α and Nve8α are related to C clade chains (they contain a TSPN module but not a minor triple helix). However, the latter two chains differ from human C clade collagens in the length of their major triple helix (Fig. 1): longer for Amq7α (1008 residues) and significantly shorter for Nve8α (961 residues). From the data available to date, we could not investigate the N-propeptide structure of three N. vectensis chains, Nve4α to Nve6α, and of the sponge Amq2α fibrillar collagen chain.TABLE 2Percentage of identity between the TSPN module of metazoan fibrillar collagens Open table in a new tab Collagen-like Proteins and COLF1 Module in the Choanoflagellate M. brevicollis—Choanoflagellates are considered the closest known relatives of metazoans. In the recent work describing the genome of M. brevicollis, the authors indicated the presence of sequence encoding triple helical domains and COLF1, a module always retrieved to date at the C terminus of metazoan fibrillar collagen chains (25King N. Westbrook M.J. Young S.L. Kuo A. Abedin M. Chapman J. Fairclough S. Hellsten U. Isogai Y. Letunic I. Marr M. Pincus D. Putnam N. Rokas A. Wright K.J. Zuzow R. Dirks W. Good M. Goodstein D. Lemons D.

Nature. 2008; 451: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). One of the two M. brevicollis putative collagenous proteins has several triple helical domains interspersed with VWA modules (Fig. 1D). This modular organization is reminiscent of the Hydra collagen Hcol6 (9Zhang X. Boot-Handford R.P. Huxley-Jones J. Forse L.N. Mould A.P. Robertson D.L. Li L. Athiyal M. Sarras Jr., M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 6792-6802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), although the distribution of VWA and triple helical domains are not identical. Three other M. brevicollis proteins contain a COLF1 module. Sequence alignments of M. brevicollis COLF1 modules with comparable domains of some demosponge and cnidarian fibrillar collagens are represented in Fig. 4. Among the eight specific cysteine residues of metazoan COLF1 module, the three choanoflagellate sequences lack cysteine residues 5 and 8, which are responsible for an intrachain disulfide bond in fibrillar α chains (38Olsen B.R. Kühn K. Schöene H. Timpl R. New Trends in Basement Membrane Research. Raven Press, New York1982: 225-236Google Scholar). These sequences also lack cysteine residues 2 and 3. Interestingly, either cysteine 2 or cysteine 3 is absent in some fibrillar collagen chains (for example, the vertebrate proα2(I) chain), whereas both of these cysteine residues are absent in sponge Amq3α and Amq4α and in the worm Arenicola marina FAm1α chain (16Sicot F.X. Exposito J.Y. Masselot M. Garrone R. Deutsch J. Gaill F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 50-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar).

This step is mediated by the translocation (T) domain upon endosome acidification, although the mechanism of interaction of the T domain with the membrane is still poorly understood. Using physicochemical approaches and spectroscopic methods, we studied the interaction of the BoNT/A T domain with the membrane as a function of pH. We found that the interaction with membranes does not involve major secondary or tertiary structural changes, as reported for other toxins like diphtheria toxin. The T domain becomes insoluble around its pI value and then penetrates into the membrane. At that stage, the T domain becomes able to permeabilize lipid vesicles. This occurs for pH values lower than 5.5, in agreement with the pH encountered by the toxin within endosomes. Electrostatic interactions are also important for the process. The role of the so-called belt region was investigated with four variant proteins presenting different lengths of the N-extremity of the T domain. We observed that this part of the T domain, which contains numerous negatively charged residues, limits the protein-membrane interaction. Indeed, interaction with the membrane of the protein deleted of this extremity takes place for higher pH values than for the entire T domain. Overall, the data suggest that acidification eliminates repulsive electrostatic interactions between the T domain and the membrane, allowing its penetration into the membrane without triggering detectable structural changes.

Seven serotypes designated as A to G are known (1Montecucco C. Schiavo G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1995; 28: 423-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). These toxins are considered to be one of the most potent toxins among bacterial, animal, and plant toxins, and chemical compounds (2Arnon S.S. Schechter R. Inglesby T.V. Henderson D.A. Bartlett J.G. Ascher M.S. Eitzen E. Fine A.D. Hauer J. Layton M. Lillibridge S. Osterholm M.T. O'Toole T. Parker G. Perl T.M. Russell P.K. Swerdlow D.L. Tonat K. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 2001; 285: 1059-1070Crossref PubMed Scopus (1355) Google Scholar). They are therefore considered as a major potential biological weapon. However, BoNTs have become an invaluable therapy for numerous neuromuscular diseases (3Montecucco C. Molgo J. Curr. Opin. Pharmacol. 2005; 5: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). BoNTs are synthesized as single polypeptide chains of 150 kDa and are activated by proteolytic cleavage generating two polypeptide chains linked through a disulfide bound. The light chain (LC, 50 kDa) corresponds to the catalytic domain that presents a zinc endopeptidase activity directed against core components of the neurotransmitter release apparatus (4Turton K. Chaddock J.A. Acharya K.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 552-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar, 5Schiavo G. Matteoli M. Montecucco C. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 717-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). The heavy chain (HC, 100 kDa) is composed of two functional domains: the translocation (T) domain at the N-terminal segment, and the receptor binding domain at the C-terminal segment. The mode of intoxication by BoNTs can be divided into four steps (5Schiavo G. Matteoli M. Montecucco C. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 717-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 6Simpson L.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2004; 44: 167-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar): (i) extracellular binding to the plasma membrane of a motoneuron junction, (ii) receptor-mediated endocytosis, (iii) membrane translocation from the endosome to the cytoplasm, and (iv) cleavage of target proteins (SNARE proteins) implicated in synaptic vesicle exocytosis. The enzymatic activity of BoNTs leads to the inhibition of acetylcholine release at the neuromuscular junction, resulting in flaccid paralysis. Considerable insights into the mechanism of action of BoNTs have been gained over the past decade. The crystallographic structure of BoNT/A (7Lacy D.B. Tepp W. Cohen A.C. DasGupta B.R. Stevens R.C.

Catalytic activities and target proteins of the various serotypes have been identified (9Niemann H. Blasi J. Jahn R.

Recent studies have provided insights into the detailed mechanisms of toxin-receptor interactions through a double receptor model (14Chai Q. Arndt J.W. Dong M. Tepp W.H. Johnson E.A. Chapman E.R.

Nevertheless, the translocation step, a key step of the intoxication mechanism, is still poorly understood. The pH-induced translocation of BoNTs is now accepted, but the exact manner of the membrane-crossing event has not been solved. Several studies sought to address this point, mainly using lipid vesicles or planar membranes and electrophysiological measurement. It has been proposed that the most appropriate explanation for the role of the heavy chain is as a dual channel and chaperone activity (18Koriazova L.K. Montal M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 13-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 19Fischer A. Montal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 10447-10452Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In this model, the channel formed by the heavy chain participates in translocation, but the heavy chain must also function in a dynamic role to escort the light chain across the membrane. Another interesting parameter potentially influencing the translocation process has recently been raised (20Brunger A.T. Breidenbach M.A. Jin R. Fischer A. Santos J.S. Montal M. PLoS Pathog. 2007; 3: 1191-1194Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It consists of the “belt” region of the translocation domain. The active site of BoNT/A is buried 20–24 Å deep in the protein and is partially shielded by this latter belt and the main body of the N-terminal domain of the HC (7Lacy D.B. Tepp W. Cohen A.C. DasGupta B.R. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Although several hypotheses have been proposed concerning the role of this belt region, no experimental evidence has been described. We studied the interaction of the isolated T domain of BoNT/A with lipid vesicles. The effects of the pH together with those of the physicochemical properties of the lipid bilayer have been investigated. We also studied the role of the belt region using “belt-region” variants. Characterization of the protein structure, when bound to lipid vesicles, and of the physicochemical parameters necessary for the interactions have been studied. Associated with vesicle permeabilization assays, these results suggest that as the pH progressively decreases, the T domain from BoNT/A binds to anionic membranes and then permeabilizes the bilayer without detectable changes in the secondary and tertiary structures. Interestingly, the belt region limits protein-membrane interaction. Cloning of the T Domain of BoNT/A—A synthetic gene encoding the residues N418-S877 (named protein Tl) of the entire BoNT/A toxin cloned in the plasmid pCR-Script was purchased from Geneart (Regensburg, Germany). The restriction sites SphI and PstI were, respectively, introduced at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the sequence. Almost 50% of the native codons were modified to optimize the expression in Escherichia coli.A potential Shine-Dalgarno sequence was also mutated, and the cysteine residue at position 454 was substituted by a serine to avoid mismatches during disulfide bond formation. The sequences encoding for fragments C454/S-S877, E491-S877, and K547-S877, corresponding to the proteins Tm, Tsm, and Ts, respectively, were PCR-amplified from the plasmid containing the synthetic gene. The primers used for PCR amplification were designed to introduce an SphI and a PstI restriction site at the 5′- and 3′-ends of the fragments, respectively. These primers are GGATCCGCATGCCTCTATCAAAGTGAACAACTGGG, GGATCCGCATGCCGAAGAAAACATTAGCCTGGATCTGATCC, and GGATCCGCATGCCAAATACACCATGTTCCACTATCTGCG at the 5′-end for Tm, Tsm, and Ts, respectively, and GCTTGGCTGCAGTTAGCTGGTGTTGATGATGTTTTTGATG at the 3′-end. After digestion of the plasmid pCR-Script-Tl and of the amplified fragments with SphI and PstI, each sequence was ligated in the plasmid pQE-81L (Qiagen) to give the plasmids pQE-81L-Tl, pQE-81L-Tm, pQE-81L-Tsm, and pQE-81L-Ts. The sequences were checked by DNA sequencing. These plasmids encode for recombinant proteins with a His tag at the N-terminal end. The plasmids encoding for the triple Trp mutants of Tm, TmW460 and TmW606, were obtained by rounds of site-directed mutagenesis from the plasmid pQE-81L-Tm. Mutations W717F and W706F were first introduced, and W606F or W460F were generated to give plasmids pQE-81L-TmW460 and pQE-81L-TmW606, respectively, and sequences were checked by DNA sequencing. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—The BoNT isoform A holotoxin was purified as previously described (21Couesnon A. Raffestin S. Popoff M.R. Microbiology. 2006; 152: 759-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The E. coli strain XL1Blue (Novagen, Madison, WI) was used as the host for recombinant proteins productions. Proteins expressions were performed by inoculation of Terrific Broth medium (Difco, Detroit, MI) with overnight precultures at 37 °C. Induction was started at an A600 of 0.7 by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and carried out at 37 °C for 4 h. After extraction, the T domains were purified from inclusion bodies by solubilization in 8 m urea, Tris-HCl (0.1 mm) at pH 8. Proteins were purified by immobilized nickel affinity chromatography. Samples were then subjected to three successive dialyses in either 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 8 for Tm, Tsm, and Ts, or 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 5 mm cysteine, 1 mm cystine, pH 8 for Tl, before size exclusion chromatography. The purification buffer of the T protein was finally exchanged with NH4HCO3 on a G25SF column before lyophilization and storage at 4 °C. Yields of proteins after purification were around 10 mg per liter of bacterial culture. Coomassie Blue staining of the proteins following SDS-PAGE showed that they have been purified nearly to homogeneity (not shown). Their apparent molecular masses were consistent with values deduced from their amino acid sequences: 54.5, 50.5, 46.3, and 39.7 kDa, for Tl, Tm, Tsm, and Ts, respectively. Lipid Vesicles—Lipids were purchased from Avantipolar Lipids (Alabaster, AL). Suspensions of large unilamellar vesicles (LUV) were prepared in either 5 or 10 mm phosphate-citrate buffer at pH 7 with egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC) for neutral vesicles, and with EPC and egg phosphatidic acid (EPA) at a 9:1 molar ratio for anionic vesicles, by reverse phase evaporation and filtration four times on 0.4-μm and six times on 0.2-μm filters (22Nizard P. Liger D. Gaillard C. Gillet D. FEBS Lett. 1998; 433: 83-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 23Rigaud J.L. Bluzat A. Buschlen S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 111: 373-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Experimental Buffers—Proteins were kept in 5 or 10 mm phosphate-citrate buffer (pH 7 or pH 3 for the Ts protein) at a concentration of 20–50 μm and were diluted in a range of the same buffers of various pH before spectroscopic measurements. The concentration of the protein solutions were checked by measuring the absorbance at 278 nm with an ϵ278 of 56,000 for Tl, 53,200 for Tm, 47,600 for Tsm, and 43,400 for Ts. The pH of the diluted proteins was checked afterward. Circular Dichroism (CD) Spectropolarimetry—CD experiments were performed on a J-815 spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) in a thermostated cell holder at 20 °C. Proteins were diluted in 5 mm phosphate-citrate buffer at the indicated pH 1 h before measurements. The scans were recorded using a bandwidth of 2 nm and an integration time of 1 s. For near-UV and far-UV measurements, each spectrum was the average of 40 scans and 15 scans, with a scan rate of 50 and 100 nm/min, and with proteins at concentrations of 4 and 0.5 μm, respectively. Spectra in the presence of LUV were obtained using a lipid/protein molar ratio of 500. The spectra were corrected for the blank, were smoothed using the FFT filter (Jasco Software, Tokyo, Japan), and were treated as previously described (24Chenal A. Nizard P. Forge V. Pugniere M. Roy M.O. Mani J.C. Guillain F. Gillet D. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). FRET Experiments—Preparation of LUV containing dansyl has been described previously (25Chenal A. Savarin P. Nizard P. Guillain F. Gillet D. Forge V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43425-43432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Briefly, LUV were prepared from EPC, EPA, and dansyl-DHPE (D57, Molecular Probes) at a 9:1:0.5 molar ratio. For each pH, aliquots of Tm (0.5 μm) were added at a lipid/protein molar ratio of 100 in the absence or presence of 200 mm NaCl, and FRET was measured (excitation wavelength: 292 nm; emission wavelength: 520 nm, bandwidth of 5 nm) after 2 h of incubation. The fluorescence intensity of the dansyl was normalized to the fluorescence of LUV in the absence of Tm. Fluorescence Extinction of the T domain in the Presence of Brominated LUV—The experiments were carried out on a photon technology international QM-4/2005 S.E. spectrofluorimeter (PTI Inc, Ford, UK) using a 1-cm path length quartz cell, at 22 °C. A bandwidth of 5 nm was used for both excitation and emission beams. The excitation wavelength was fixed at 292 nm, and emission spectra were recorded from 310 to 370 nm. LUV containing EPC/EPA/(9–10Br)-PC (Avantipolar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) at 5:1:4 molar ratio were incubated 2 h in the presence of 1 μm protein, using a lipid/protein molar ratio of 500 in phosphate-citrate buffer at different pH values. The fluorescence extinction of Trp was evaluated using the ratio F/F0, where F and F0 are the fluorescence at 340 nm in the presence of LUV containing or not brominated lipids, respectively. Results represent the average of five independent measurements. To study the role of electrostatic interactions in protein-lipid interaction, samples were then incubated one night at room temperature in the presence of 200 mm NaCl before fluorescence extinction measurements. Fluorescence Spectroscopy in the Presence of LUV—Fluorescence measurements were performed with an FP-750 spectrofluorimeter (Jasco, Tokyo, Japan) in a thermostatted cell holder at 22 °C, using a 1-cm path length quartz cell as described previously (24Chenal A. Nizard P. Forge V. Pugniere M. Roy M.O. Mani J.C. Guillain F. Gillet D. Protein Eng. 2002; 15: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26Montagner C. Perier A. Pichard S. Vernier G. Menez A. Gillet D. Forge V. Chenal A. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1878-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Proteins at a concentration of 0.5 μm were mixed with LUV at a lipid/protein molar ratio of 1000 in a 5 mm phosphate-citrate buffer at the pH indicated, and samples were incubated 1 h at 22 °C before measurements. The maximum emission wavelength (λmax) represents the average of three values obtained from emission spectra that were corrected for blank measurements. LUV Leakage Assay—LUV were prepared with 5 mm phosphate-citrate, pH 7, containing 50 mm sulforhodamine B (SRB) (Molecular Probes) as previously described (27Faudry E. Vernier G. Neumann E. Forge V. Attree I. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8117-8123Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). After filtration, unincorporated dye was removed by size exclusion chromatography on a PD10 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 5 mm phosphate-citrate, 50 mm or 200 mm NaCl, pH 7. Dye efflux was monitored by the increase in fluorescence on a Jasco FP-750 spectrofluorimeter after the addition of 9 nm protein to a 1.5-ml suspension of 9 μm LUV in 5 mm phosphate-citrate buffer at different pH (excitation wavelength: 565 nm; emission wavelength: 586 nm) with stirring. SRB was selected as a fluorescent probe because of its high quantum yield independently of the pH. Fluorescence was normalized as previously described (27Faudry E. Vernier G. Neumann E. Forge V. Attree I. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 8117-8123Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) with Equation 1, F(t)norm=(F(t)−F0)/(Fmax−F0) where F0 is the fluorescence level before protein addition and Fmax the level after addition of Triton X-100 at the end of each assay. The initial rate (V0) was deduced from the slope from the origin of the curves. Characterization of the Recombinant Protein Structure and Solubility—The construction of the plasmids pQE-81L-Tl, pQE-81L-Tm (-TmW460, -TmW606), pQE-81L-Tsm, and pQE-81L-Ts and the expression of the different forms of the T domain are described under “Experimental Procedures.” The structures of the recombinant proteins deduced from the structure of the entire BoNT/A are shown in Fig. 1A. The Tm protein corresponds to the activated form of the BoNT/A T domain, i.e. the T domain following proteolytic cleavage between LC and HC, before residue C454. The Tl protein starts at residue N418. It carries an N-terminal extension made of the C-terminal β-strand of LC. This element is intended to restore the β-sheet between LC and HC, in which is located the proteolytic cleavage site, and the native disulfide bond between LC and HC. In the Ts protein, the long N-terminal belt surrounding LC (C454-D546) in the native toxin is removed, compared with Tm. The Tsm protein is an intermediate form between Tm and Ts and presents a partial deletion of the N terminus of the T domain (residues C454-A490). The folding of the proteins at pH 7 was first investigated by CD in the far- and near-UV (Fig. 1B). The far-UV spectra of Tl, Tm, and Tsm indicated a mainly α-helical content, in agreement with the crystal structure of BoNT/A (7Lacy D.B. Tepp W. Cohen A.C. DasGupta B.R. Stevens R.C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 898-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). The spectra of Ts are less characteristic, with a loss of signal at 208 nm. Near-UV CD allows the detection of aromatic residues engaged in a rigid chiral environment, consistent with the presence of a tertiary structure. The detection of a broad signal around 280 nm for Tl, Tm, and Tsm in the near-UV, which may be attributed to the signal of Tyr and Trp, indicates that these proteins present a tertiary structure. However, at the concentration used for near-UV CD (4 μm), the Ts protein has a strong tendency to aggregate, which could explain the shape of its spectrum. This observation led us to investigate the solubility of the T proteins as a function of pH. We measured the optical density of the supernatant of centrifuged protein solutions at various pH values. As shown on Fig. 1C, the proteins are highly susceptible to pH: Tl and Tm precipitate from pH 5.5 to 3.5, and Tsm from pH 6 to 3.5. Ts is soluble at pH 4 only. The difference of solubility of the proteins above pH 5.5 can be explained by their pI, which has been estimated from their primary sequence to be 5.28, 5.09, 5.42, and 6.62 for Tl, Tm, Tsm, and Ts, respectively. The four proteins being soluble at pH 3, their folding was studied by CD at this pH. The spectra in the far- and near-UV of Tl, Tm, and Tsm are nearly identical to those obtained at pH 7 (Fig. 1B and not shown). Ts shows a similar profile as Tm (Fig. 1B, insets). These results confirm that the four proteins are folded after purification and indicate that at acidic pH, the T domain of BoNT/A does not undergo detectable conformational changes. Interaction of the T Domain with Membranes as a Function of pH— The binding of the T domain to LUV was monitored by fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the Trp residues of the proteins and a dansyl fluorescent probe linked to the phospholipid headgroups. Indeed, although the incubation of T proteins in the presence of liposomes increases their solubility, partition experiments by ultracentrifugation of the LUV (25Chenal A. Savarin P. Nizard P. Guillain F. Gillet D. Forge V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43425-43432Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 28Perier A. Chassaing A. Raffestin S. Pichard S. Masella M. Menez A. Forge V. Chenal A. Gillet D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 24239-24245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) could not be used because of some protein precipitation, whatever the pH. The T domain of BoNT/A contains four Trp residues (Fig. 1A, structure of Tl). When these residues (the donors) approach the dansyl groups (the acceptors), FRET is detected as an increase of the acceptor fluorescence. In the presence of anionic LUV, a FRET signal appears for pH values below 5.5 for Tl, Tm, and Tsm and the F/F0 ratio reaches a maximum for pH values below 4 (Fig. 2). Ts shows a different behavior as the FRET is detected from pH 6, and the F/F0 ratio is higher than for the other T proteins. The increase of the ratio value upon acidification reveals the proximity between the Trps and the polar headgroups of the lipid bilayer and demonstrates the interaction of the T proteins with the membrane. Interestingly, the data obtained for Ts show that deletion of the N-terminal belt of the T domain favors its interaction with the membrane. However, no conclusion can be drawn from the FRET data about the location of the Trps within the membrane, because fluorescence transfer between the donor and acceptor groups (Trp and dansyl) occurs in an nm distance range. Finally, when the same experiments were performed in the presence of neutral LUV made of EPC, FRET is detected only for pH values under 4.5 for all four proteins (Fig. 2, inset). The F/F0 ratio is about two times lower than in the presence of anionic LUV. The results indicate that charges are not necessary, but favor the interaction of the protein with the membrane. Thus, hydrophobic effects should also be involved in the binding of the T domain of BoNT/A to the membrane. Penetration of the T Domain into the Membrane—Br is a short distance (≤ 10 Å) quencher of Trp fluorescence. The extinction of Trp fluorescence of a protein in the presence of LUV containing 40% phospholipids brominated at position 9–10 of the aliphatic chain reveals the insertion of the Trp into the hydrophobic core of the bilayer. As shown in Fig. 3A, the F/F0 ratio at 350 nm of Tm does not significantly change at pH 7.5 and 6.5 and is nearly equal to 1. Around pH 5.5 and below, the F/F0 ratio decreases as a function of pH and reaches 0.3 around pH 3.5. These results show that the T domain not only interacts with, but also penetrates into the anionic membrane as the pH drops. Interestingly, after the addition of 200 mm NaCl to the samples, the quenching is abolished and the F/F0 ratio returns to 1, whatever the pH (Fig. 3A and not shown). However, FRET from the Tm protein to dansyl groups in the interfacial region of the membrane is not affected by the presence of 200 mm NaCl (Fig. 3B). NaCl acts as a shield for charges. Thus, the results indicate that the involvement of electrostatic interactions is more important for deep penetration in the membrane than for membrane binding. It should be noted however that Br quenching is more sensitive to distance changes than FRET. Fluorescence of the T Proteins as a Function of pH in the Presence of LUV—The λmax of emission of a Trp excited at 292 nm reflects the polarity of its environment. In a hydrophilic environment, the λmax can reach 355 nm whereas in an apolar environment, the λmax can shift to 320–330 nm. Upon acidification, the λmax of the T proteins slightly shifts, from 337 to 334 for Tm, and from 335 to 332 for Ts (Fig. 4A). This change in the fluorescence spectra occurs between pH 5.8 and 4 and is accompanied by an increase in the intensity of Trp fluorescence (Fig. 4B). Similar results were obtained for the Tl and Tsm proteins (not shown). Although weak, we consider these changes significant because they correspond to tendencies over many data points. These variations of Trp fluorescence suggest that one or more Trp becomes less exposed to the solvent at acidic pH. Among the four Trps of the T domain, Trps 460 and 606 are localized at the surface of the protein, whereas Trps 706 and 717 are constrained into the structure (Fig. 1A, structure of Tl). Because the localization of Trps 460 and 606 suggest a susceptibility to environmental changes, two mutant Tm proteins (TmW460 and TmW606) have been produced, in which all but Trp 460 or Trp 606 have been mutated into Phe. The secondary and tertiary structures of these mutants have been checked by CD spectroscopy. The variations of λmax measured for the two mutants in the presence of LUV as a function of pH are larger than for Tm. It shifts from 341 to 325 for TmW460 and from 336 to 327 for TmW606 (Fig. 4A). Simultaneously, the intensity of Trp fluorescence also increases (Fig. 4B). The lower values of fluorescence intensity observed for the mutants compared with Tm and Ts is only due to the presence of one Trp residue instead of four (Tm) or three (Ts). Thus, the variations of λmax obtained for the T mutant proteins confirm the significance of the changes observed for Tm. These results could reveal a slight change of the tertiary structure as well as the insertion of the Trps into the membrane. However, these results confirming the Trp quenching experiments by the brominated LUV (Fig. 3) mainly indicate that the T domain penetrates into the hydrophobic core of the membrane from pH 5.5 as the pH decreases. Penetration of the T Domain into the Membrane Is Modulated by Its N-terminal Belt—Membrane penetration of BoNT may be detected by the permeabilization of planar bilayers (19Fischer A. Montal M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 10447-10452Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 29Fischer A. Montal M. J. Biol.

This has been shown also for the isolated T domain of other toxins (25Chenal A. Savarin P. Nizard P. Guillain F. Gillet D. Forge V. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 43425-43432Abstract Full Text Full"
https://openalex.org/W2057973123,"The protonmotive force across the inner mitochondrial membrane (Δp) has two components: membrane potential (ΔΨ) and the gradient of proton concentration (ΔpH). The computer model of oxidative phosphorylation developed previously by Korzeniewski et al. (Korzeniewski, B., Noma, A., and Matsuoka, S. (2005) Biophys.

Nature. 1961; 191: 144-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (2860) Google Scholar), the intermediate that couples the electron flow through the respiratory chain with ATP synthesis by ATP synthase in the mitochondrial matrix is the protonmotive force (Δp) across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This thermodynamic potential is composed of two components: electrical membrane potential (ΔΨ) and the difference between the cytosolic and matrix pH (ΔpH).

The contribution of ΔΨ and ΔpH to Δp is very important from the kinetic point of view, because ΔΨ and ΔpH exert a different influence on such elements of the system and processes as: complex III (C3), 2The abbreviations used are: C3, complex III; ROS, reactive oxygen species; i, intramitochondrial; e, extramitochondrial; DH, substrate dehydrogenation; C1, complex I; C4, complex IV; SN, ATP synthase; ANT, ATP/ADP carrier; PiT, phosphate carrier; cons, ATP consumption; LK, proton leak; Kuni, K+ uniport; KHex, K+/H+ exchange; MCA, Metabolic Control Analysis. 2The abbreviations used are: C3, complex III; ROS, reactive oxygen species; i, intramitochondrial; e, extramitochondrial; DH, substrate dehydrogenation; C1, complex I; C4, complex IV; SN, ATP synthase; ANT, ATP/ADP carrier; PiT, phosphate carrier; cons, ATP consumption; LK, proton leak; Kuni, K+ uniport; KHex, K+/H+ exchange; MCA, Metabolic Control Analysis. complex IV (C4), ATP/ADP carrier, phosphate carrier (12Nicholls D.G. Ferguson S.J. Bioenergetics. 3. Academic Press, London2002Google Scholar), proton leak (13Krishnamoorthy G. Hinkle P.C. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1640-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production (8Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). The ATP/ADP carrier is driven by ΔΨ, whereas the phosphate carrier is driven by ΔpH. Complex III transfers four protons but only two positive charges, whereas complex IV transfers two protons and four positive charges (12Nicholls D.G. Ferguson S.J. Bioenergetics. 3. Academic Press, London2002Google Scholar); therefore complex III is relatively more sensitive to ΔpH, whereas complex IV is to ΔΨ. The proton leak seems to be more sensitive to ΔΨ (13Krishnamoorthy G. Hinkle P.C. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 1640-1645Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), while ROS production is to ΔpH (8Lambert A.J. Brand M.D. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). Therefore, the total value of Δp alone cannot define satisfactorily the kinetic properties of the oxidative phosphorylation system. It is commonly accepted that the contribution of ΔΨ and ΔpH to Δp is determined by secondary transport of ions, especially potassium ions (K+), driven by building up the proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane (12Nicholls D.G. Ferguson S.J. Bioenergetics. 3. Academic Press, London2002Google Scholar). It is also accepted that without this secondary transport, Δp would be almost exclusively (about 99%) in the form of ΔΨ, because, at the real electrical capacity of the inner mitochondrial membrane and the pH buffering capacity of the matrix, the transport of a very small amount of protons would build up the physiological value of Δp (12Nicholls D.G. Ferguson S.J. Bioenergetics. 3. Academic Press, London2002Google Scholar). It has been shown that Δp and its components do not depend very significantly on the extramitochondrial [K+] (5Czyż A. Szewczyk A. Nałęcz J. Wojtczak L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 10Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 50: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar), especially at higher physiological potassium ion concentrations. It has been observed in some studies (3Kunz W. Gellerich F.N. Schild L. Schönfeld P. FEBS Lett. 1988; 233: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 10Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 50: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar) that an increase in [Pi] from 0 to physiological values (10 mm) causes a significant decrease in Δp; at the same time ΔΨ slightly increases or remains constant after an initial decrease and ΔpH significantly decreases. On the other hand, Bose et al. encountered a significant increase in Δp and ΔΨ and a decrease in the very small ΔpH they measured. Several trials of a quantitative description of the contribution of ΔΨ and ΔpH to Δp have been undertaken (14Reich J.G. Rohde K. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1983; 1: 37-46Google Scholar, 15Schuster S.

Bioenerg. 1998; 45: 181-192Crossref Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These descriptions are based on different assumptions, give different predictions, and their verification by comparison with experimental data is limited. Generally, they are relatively simple and phenomenological. Recently Beard (17Beard D.A. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2005; 1: e36Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) developed a computer model of oxidative phosphorylation, based on the general structure of the model built by Korzeniewski et al. (18Korzeniewski B. Froncisz W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1060: 210-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 19Korzeniewski B. Mazat J.-P. Biochem.

Chem. 2005; 116: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) that involves explicitly the K+ uniport, K+/H+ exchange across the inner mitochondrial membrane, and membrane capacitance. This model predicts a very low value of ΔpH (below 3 mV, 0.05 pH units), similar to that obtained in an experimental manner by Bose et al. (11Bose S. French S. Evans F.J. Joubert F. Balaban R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39115-39165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (175) Google Scholar). The original model developed by Korzeniewski et al. (18Korzeniewski B. Froncisz W. Biochim. Biophys.

Chem. 2005; 116: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) is able to reproduce, at least semiquantitatively, a broad range of different kinetic properties of the oxidative phosphorylation system in isolated mitochondria and intact tissues. However, this model uses a simplified, phenomenological description of the relationship between Δp, ΔΨ, and ΔpH: it assumes a fixed, constant contribution of ΔΨ to Δp, u = 0.861. This assumption was based on experimental data concerning state 4, state 3, and intermediate states in isolated mitochondria (2Duszyński J. Bogucka K. Wojtczak L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 767: 540-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), but is certainly oversimplified and unsatisfactory under many conditions. Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA) (23Kacser H. Burns J.

It was used in a great number of experimental and theoretical studies concerning the control of metabolic pathways (see Refs. 19Korzeniewski B. Mazat J.-P. Biochem.

Gellerich F. Kunz W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 230: 549-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar for a few examples). Computer Model—The computer dynamic model of oxidative phosphorylation in intact heart developed previously by Korzeniewski et al. (22Korzeniewski B. Noma A. Matsuoka S. Biophys. Chem. 2005; 116: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) was extended to replace the fixed constant ΔΨ/Δp ratio (u = 0.861) with a more mechanistic description of ion transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane, similarly as it was done by Beard (17Beard D.A. PLoS Comput. Biol. 2005; 1: e36Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). The K+ uniport, K+/H+ exchange, and membrane capacitance were involved explicitly. The general scheme of the modeled system is presented in Fig. 1. The rates of K+ uniport (vKuni) and K+/H+ exchange (vKHex) are described by the following kinetic Equations 1 and 2, VKuni=kKuni·([K+]e·e-ΔΨ2·RTF-[K+]i·eΔΨ2·RTF)(Eq. 1) VKHex=kKHex·([K+]i·[H+]e-[K+]e·[H+]i)(Eq. 2) where kKuni = 1.0·10-5 min-1 and kKHex = 3.485·10-3 min-1·μm-1 are rate constants in the “reference point” (see below). R, T, and F have the typical meanings, subscript e means extramitochondrial and subscript i means intramitochondrial. The changes over time in intramitochondrial and extramitochondrial [H+] are described by the following differential Equations 3 and 4, [H+·]i=(-4·VC1-2·VC3-4·VC4+nA·VSN+VPiT+VLK+VKHex)·RcmbuffHi(Eq. 3) [H+·]e=(4·VC1+4·VC3+2·VC4-nA·VSN-VPiT-VLK-VKHex-VEFF)/buffHe(Eq. 4) where Rcm = 3.35 is the ratio of the cell volume to mitochondria volume in heart cells, buffHi is the matrix proton-buffering coefficient, and buffHe is the cytosol proton-buffering coefficient. Some fraction ([Pi2-]/([Pi-]+[Pi2-])) of Pi- transported by phosphate carrier (PiT) to the mitochondrial matrix dissociates to Pi2- and H+, but they are quickly used by ATP synthase, and therefore no net protons are produced/consumed in the matrix. The opposite situation prevails in the cytosol. An analogical situation is the production/consumption of H+ (together with NADH) by the substrate dehydrogenation/complex I. All these processes are not related to proton and/or charge transfer across the inner mitochondrial membrane and therefore are not taken into account explicitly within the model. Complex I (C1) transports (for 2 electrons) 4 H+ from matrix to cytosol; complex III (C3) takes up (for 2 electrons) 2 H+ from the matrix, and releases 4 H+ to the cytosol; complex IV takes up (for 2 electrons or 1 oxygen atom) 4 H+ from the matrix (including 2 H+ for water molecule formation) and releases 2 H+ to the cytosol; ATP synthase (SN) transports nA = 2.5 protons from cytosol to matrix for one ATP molecule synthesized; phosphate carrier (PiT), proton leak (LK), and K+/H+ exchange (KHex) transport 1 H+ from cytosol to matrix. All these processes are taken into account explicitly in the model. The changes over time in intramitochondrial [K+] are described by the following differential Equation 5. [K+]i·=(VKuni-VKHex)·Rcm(Eq. 5) The potassium ion concentration in heart is very well regulated. (There are huge potassium stores in other tissues, especially in skeletal muscle, which can buffer the potassium concentration in heart (31Sejersted O.M. Sjøgaard G. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1422-1481Crossref Scopus (367) Google Scholar).) Therefore, we assumed that the extramitochondrial (cytosolic) [K+] is constant. (This assumption also corresponds well to the isolated mitochondria system.) All the simulations presented below were performed under this assumption. However, we also tested the possibility that there is a constant cellular (cytosolic plus mitochondrial) pool of potassium ions and therefore Equation 6 applies. [K+]e·=(VKHex-VKuni)(Eq. 6) In both cases the theoretical results were similar (not shown), and therefore the above assumption is not particularly important for the properties of the system. The changes over time in ΔΨ are described by Equation 7, ΔΨ·=(-4·vC1-2·vC3-4·vC4+nA·vSN+vANT+vLK+vKuni)RcmCm(Eq. 7) where the inner mitochondrial membrane capacitance, Cm, is 1 μm/mV, as in Refs. 17Beard D.A.

C1 transfers (for 2 electrons) 4 positive charges form matrix to cytosol; C3 transfers (per 2 electrons) 2 positive charges from matrix to cytosol (4 protons and 2 electrons); C4 transfers (for 2 electrons or 1 oxygen atom) 4 positive charges from matrix to cytosol (2 protons plus 2 electrons from cytosol to matrix); ATP synthase transfers nA = 2.5 positive charges from cytosol to matrix; ATP/ADP carrier, proton leak, and K+ uniport transport 1 positive charge from cytosol to matrix. The reference point for the computer simulation carried out in the present study corresponded to a slowly beating intact heart (22Korzeniewski B. Noma A. Matsuoka S. Biophys. Chem. 2005; 116: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this point, the following variable values were recorded: VO2 = 2.633 mm·min-1, [ATP]e = 6.663 mm, [ADP]e = 36.37 μm, [Pi]e = 2.351 mm, Δp = 181.9 mV, ΔΨ = 156.6 mV, ΔpH = 25.30 mV, (u = ΔΨ/Δp = 0.861), [H+]e = 0.1 μm, [H+]i = 0.03733 μm, [K+]e = 120 mm, [K+]i = 118.0 mm. The rate constants of K+ uniport and K+/H+ antiport were adjusted to be relatively quick and to give the u = ΔΨ/Δp value of 0.861 used in the original model (22Korzeniewski B. Noma A. Matsuoka S. Biophys. Chem. 2005; 116: 145-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar): kKuni = 1.0·10-5 min-1 and kKHex = 3.485·10-3 min-1·μm–1. The complete description of the model of oxidative phosphorylation with a mechanistic description of the relationship between ΔΨ and ΔpH in intact heart is located on the web site as supplemental material. Metabolic Control Analysis—The most fundamental idea of MCA is based on the ratio of the relative change (dY/Y) in some variable Y caused by a small relative change (dX/X) in some parameter/variable X, to the latter change in Equation 8. ∂Y/Y∂X/X(Eq. 8) In principle, these changes are infinitesimal, but in practice sufficiently small finite changes can be considered. In particular, control coefficients defined within MCA characterize the control exerted by particular components of a given metabolic system (enzymes, carriers, processes, and metabolic blocks) over different macroscopic properties (variables) of the system. Control coefficients are defined in Equation 9, CEiU=∂U/U∂Ei/Ei(Eq. 9) where U is some property (variable) of the system and Ei is the activity/concentration of the i-th component of the system. Several control coefficients have been defined within MCA, concerning the control over the flux, metabolite concentrations, Δp etc. (see e.g. Refs. 7Hafner R.P. Brown G.C. Brand M.D. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 188: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 25Fell D. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 313-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 28Groen A. Wanders R. Westerhoff H. van der Meer R. Tager J. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 157: 2754-2757Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The metabolic control of particular elements of the oxidative phosphorylation system over Δp, u = ΔΨ/Δp, K+ cycling, and H+ cycling was calculated according to Equation 9 (U represented Δp; u, K+ cycling rate or H+ cycling rate). In subsequent computer simulations, the original rate constants of particular steps were increased by a relative factor of 0.01 (by 1%) and the relative changes in particular U-s between the original and the new steady state were recorded. First of all, our model predicts that in the reference point (that reflects the physiological conditions) there is a very small difference between the cytosolic and matrix potassium ion concentration (120.0 mm versus 118.0 mm, respectively) and ΔΨ is the dominant component of Δp. These properties of the model agree excellently with recent conclusions drawn by Nicholls (33Nicholls D.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1710: 63-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar): “In an intact cell, or with isolated mitochondria in a physiologically relevant high K+ medium, there is essentially no gradient of K+ across the inner mitochondrial membrane, the concentration being close to 120 mm in each compartment. Under these conditions, ΔpH is usually small...”. To simulate the dependence of Δp, ΔΨ, and ΔpH on kKuni, the value of this constant was changed by six orders of magnitude, while kKHex was kept constant. An increase in kKuni slightly decreases Δp, as it can be seen in Fig. 2A. However, ΔΨ and ΔpH change significantly with the increase in kKuni: ΔΨ strongly decreases and ΔpH strongly increases. At very low kKuni values, almost the entire Δp is in the form of ΔΨ. An increase in kKuni elevates the mitochondrial [K+], but these changes are rather moderate: in the whole range of kKuni an about 2-fold increase in [K+]i is observed. The dependence of Δp, ΔΨ, and ΔpH on kKHex is opposite to the dependence on kKuni, as it can be seen in the simulations shown in Fig. 2B. In these simulations, kKHex was changed by six orders of magnitude, while kKuni was kept constant. An increase in kKHex slightly increases Δp, strongly increases ΔpH, and strongly decreases ΔΨ. At very high kKHex values, almost the entire Δp is in the form of ΔΨ.[K+]i drops about twice with the increase in kKHex. The above simulations clearly show that the contribution of ΔΨ and ΔpH to Δp strongly depends on the absolute values of the rate constants of the K+ uniport and K+/H+ antiport: kKuni and kKHex. However, when the values of these constants are changed in parallel in relation to the reference point, by the same factor, and thus the ratio of the rate constants is kept constant (kKuni/kKHex = 2.896·10-3 in the reference point), the value of Δp and the ΔΨ/ΔpH ratio are essentially unaffected. This is shown in Fig. 2C. Therefore, the contribution of ΔΨ and ΔpH to Δp is determined by the relative values (ratio) of kKuni and kKHex. It is also worth noticing that [K+]i remains constant at the constant kKuni/kKHex ratio. At very high values of kKuni and kKHex (for the constant kKuni/kKHex ratio), the values of ΔΨ, ΔpH, and Δp slightly decrease, because the very quick K+ circulation and thus K+/H+ exchange prevailing under such conditions leads to a significant dissipation of Δp. Whereas the K+/H+ exchange contributes in 0.044% to the overall H+ cycling in the reference point, this contribution increases to 36% at the right-most point in Fig. 2C. A decrease in the extramitochondrial phosphorylation potential brought about by an increase in either [ADP] or [Pi] (with other external metabolite concentrations, i.e. [ATP] and [Pi] or [ATP] and [Pi], kept constant) leads to a decrease in Δp, while the increase in the extramitochondrial phosphorylation potential related to an increase in [ATP] ([ADP] and [Pi] kept constant) is accompanied by an increase in Δp (see Fig. 3, A–C). However, the relative contribution of ΔΨ and ΔpH to Δp changes with changes in [ADP], [ATP], and [Pi]. While ΔΨ follows the decrease in Δp with an increase in [ADP] and the increase in Δp with an increase in [ATP], ΔpH slightly increases in the first case and slightly decreases in the second. An even more interesting situation takes place in the case of an increase in [Pi], here at higher Pi concentrations ΔΨ slightly increases (after an initial decrease), at the cost of a significant decrease in ΔpH. Therefore, the contribution of ΔΨ to Δp increases of course at higher [Pi]. The simulated dependence of Δp, ΔΨ, and ΔpH on [Pi] is compared in Fig. 3C with experimental data by Kunz et al. (3Kunz W. Gellerich F.N. Schild L. Schönfeld P. FEBS Lett. 1988; 233: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and Nicholls (10Nicholls D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1974; 50: 305-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Generally, a good agreement can be observed (see “Discussion” for details). In our simulations, Δp, ΔΨ, and ΔpH are essentially independent of the extramitochondrial K+ concentration (Fig. 3D) (in this theoretical analysis, different constant [K+]e in the range between 0 and 120 mm were fixed in subsequent simulations) although at low [K+] the system approaches the steady state very slowly (starting from the reference point) because the K+ uniport and K+/H+ exchange are very slow (not shown). Our simulations are compared in Fig. 3D with experimental data by Czyż et al. (5Czyż A. Szewczyk A. Nałęcz J. Wojtczak L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 210: 98-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Again, a good agreement can be observed (see also “Discussion”). The increase in [Pi] causes an increase in the rate of oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis (not shown) and an increase in the reduction level of cytochrome c (see Fig. 4). This effect is not related to the activation of complex III by Pi, because such activation is not included in our model. The absolute value of Δp is controlled to the greatest extent by the ATP demand, although the control is distributed among essentially all components of the system. This is shown in Fig. 5. Generally, the processes that participate (directly or indirectly) in the production of Δp (substrate dehydrogenation, complex I, complex III, and complex IV) have a positive control, while the processes dissipating Δp (ATP usage, proton leak) have a negative control over Δp. The sum of the concentration control coefficients over Δp equals zero (negative controls counter-balance positive controls), in agreement with the so-called connectivity property (25Fell D. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 313-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). In the presence of K+ uniport and K+/H+ antiport, just these two processes control to the greatest extent the contribution of ΔΨ and ΔpH to Δp. As can be seen in Fig. 6A, K+ uniport has a great negative control over u = ΔΨ/Δp, while K+/H+ antiport has a great positive control over this variable. ATP usage has a moderate positive control over u, and the contribution of the remaining steps to the control is minor. In the absence of K+ uniport and K+/H+ antiport (kKuni and kKHex set to 0) the metabolic co"
https://openalex.org/W1987958662,"Repair of interstrand DNA cross-links (ICLs) in Escherichia coli can occur through a combination of nucleotide excision repair (NER) and homologous recombination. However, an alternative mechanism has been proposed in which repair is initiated by NER followed by translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) and completed through another round of NER. Using site-specifically modified oligodeoxynucleotides that serve as a model for potential repair intermediates following incision by E. coli NER proteins, the ability of E. coli DNA polymerases (pol) II and IV to catalyze TLS past N(2)-N(2)-guanine ICLs was determined. No biochemical evidence was found suggesting that pol II could bypass these lesions. In contrast, pol IV could catalyze TLS when the nucleotides that are 5' to the cross-link were removed. The efficiency of TLS was further increased when the nucleotides 3' to the cross-linked site were also removed. The correct nucleotide, C, was preferentially incorporated opposite the lesion. When E. coli cells were transformed with a vector carrying a site-specific N(2)-N(2)-guanine ICL, the transformation efficiency of a pol II-deficient strain was indistinguishable from that of the wild type. However, the ability to replicate the modified vector DNA was nearly abolished in a pol IV-deficient strain. These data strongly suggest that pol IV is responsible for TLS past N(2)-N(2)-guanine ICLs."
https://openalex.org/W2011140280,"Methionine is an essential amino acid in mammals at the junction of methylation, protein synthesis, and sulfur pathways. However, this amino acid is highly susceptible to oxidation, resulting in a mixture of methionine-S-sulfoxide and methionine-R-sulfoxide. Whether methionine is quantitatively regenerated from these compounds is unknown. Here we report that SK-Hep1 hepatocytes grew on methionine-S-sulfoxide and consumed this compound by import and methionine-S-sulfoxide reductase (MsrA)-dependent reduction, but methionine-R-sulfoxide reductases were not involved in this process, and methionine-R-sulfoxide could not be used by the cells. However, SK-Hep1 cells expressing a yeast free methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase proliferated in the presence of either sulfoxide, reduced them, and showed increased resistance to oxidative stress. Only methionine-R-sulfoxide was detected in the plasma of wild type mice, but both sulfoxides were in the plasma of MsrA knock-out mice. These results show that mammals can support methionine metabolism by reduction of methionine-S-sulfoxide, that this process is dependent on MsrA, that mammals are inherently deficient in the reduction of methionine-R-sulfoxide, and that expression of yeast free methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase can fully compensate for this deficiency.

Here we report that SK-Hep1 hepatocytes grew on methionine-S-sulfoxide and consumed this compound by import and methionine-S-sulfoxide reductase (MsrA)-dependent reduction, but methionine-R-sulfoxide reductases were not involved in this process, and methionine-R-sulfoxide could not be used by the cells. However, SK-Hep1 cells expressing a yeast free methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase proliferated in the presence of either sulfoxide, reduced them, and showed increased resistance to oxidative stress. Only methionine-R-sulfoxide was detected in the plasma of wild type mice, but both sulfoxides were in the plasma of MsrA knock-out mice. These results show that mammals can support methionine metabolism by reduction of methionine-S-sulfoxide, that this process is dependent on MsrA, that mammals are inherently deficient in the reduction of methionine-R-sulfoxide, and that expression of yeast free methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase can fully compensate for this deficiency. Methionine (Met) is an essential amino acid in mammals. Besides its utilization for protein synthesis, Met supports the cellular S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methylation cycle and is used for biosynthesis of cysteine and other compounds (Fig. 1) (1Baker D.H.

As a central metabolite in the global sulfur and methylation pathways, Met homeostasis is subject to exquisite regulation that tightly controls fluxes of Met-derived metabolites and Met itself (4Prudova A.

Despite extensive information on Met regulation, one pathway critical to Met availability and homeostasis did not receive sufficient attention to date. Being a sulfur-containing amino acid, Met, along with Cys, is highly susceptible to oxidation by reactive oxygen species (ROS) 2The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; ATF3, activating transcription factor 3; CBS, cystathionine β-synthase; fRMsr, free methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase; OPA, o-phthalaldehyde; Met-SO, methionine-S-sulfoxide; Met-RO, methionine-R-sulfoxide; MsrA, methionine sulfoxide reductase A; MsrB, methionine sulfoxide reductase B; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MTS, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium. 2The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; ATF3, activating transcription factor 3; CBS, cystathionine β-synthase; fRMsr, free methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase; OPA, o-phthalaldehyde; Met-SO, methionine-S-sulfoxide; Met-RO, methionine-R-sulfoxide; MsrA, methionine sulfoxide reductase A; MsrB, methionine sulfoxide reductase B; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MTS, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium. generated during oxidative stress and normal cellular metabolism. ROS can oxidize both free Met and Met residues in proteins, resulting in a diastereomeric mixture of Met sulfoxides: Met-S-sulfoxide (Met-SO) and Met-R-sulfoxide (Met-RO) (6Boschi-Muller S. Olry A. Antoine M. Branlant G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1703: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 7Sharov V.S. Ferrington D.A. Squier T.C. Schöneich C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). To repair Met-SO and Met-RO residues in proteins, cells have evolved two families of enzymes known as Met sulfoxide reductases: MsrA that is specific for Met-SO and MsrB that specifically reduces Met-RO (8Weissbach H. Resnick L. Brot N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1703: 203-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The active sites of proteins in both Msr families are better adapted for binding Met sulfoxide residues than free Met sulfoxides (6Boschi-Muller S. Olry A. Antoine M. Branlant G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1703: 231-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Although both MsrA and MsrB are capable of reducing free Met sulfoxides (9Kim H.Y. Gladyshev V.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), a contribution of these enzymes to the reduction of these amino acids is not known (10Oien D.B. Moskovitz J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2007; 352: 556-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Mammals have one MsrA and three MsrB isozymes, with selenoprotein MsrB1 localized to cytosol and nucleus, MsrB2 to mitochondria, and MsrB3 to the endoplasmic reticulum (9Kim H.Y. Gladyshev V.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). A single MsrA is partitioned into various cellular compartments by alternative first exon splicing and folding-dependent cytosolic retention of the protein containing a mitochondrial targeting signal (11Haenold R. Wassef R. Hansel A. Heinemann S.H. Hoshi T. Free Radic. Res. 2007; 28: 1-13Google Scholar, 12Vougier S. Mary J. Friguet B. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 8059-8067Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). MsrA and MsrB are thought to both repair oxidatively damaged Met residues and serve as antioxidant proteins, thus supporting the role of Met residues in scavenging ROS (15Stadtman E.R. Moskovitz J. Berlett B.S. Levine R.L. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2002; 234–235: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Consistent with these ideas, deletion of Msrs reduces life span in yeast and mice (16Moskovitz J. Bar-Noy S. Williams W.M. Requena J. Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2748-2753Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In comparison with the repair of oxidized Met residues, reduction of free Met sulfoxides in mammals received little attention. On the other hand, several cellular fractions with proteins distinct from MsrA and MsrB were found to reduce free Met sulfoxides in bacteria (20Etienne F. Spector D. Brot N. Weissbach H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 378-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Furthermore, by analyzing bacterial cells deficient in MsrA and MsrB, two enzymes were identified that acted exclusively on free Met sulfoxides. A molybdoprotein-containing biotin sulfoxide reductase BisC (21Ezraty B. Bos J. Barras F. Aussel L. J. Bacteriol. 2005; 187: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) was found to reduce free Met-SO, whereas a GAF domain-containing protein fRMsr was specific for free Met-RO (22Lin Z. Johnson L.C. Weissbach H. Brot N. Lively M.O. Lowther W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 9597-9602Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In this work, we characterized the ability of mammals to reduce free Met sulfoxides. Whereas Met-SO was reduced by MsrA, mammalian cells were deficient in the reduction of free Met-RO. However, cells expressing a yeast fRMsr homolog could efficiently utilize Met-RO. Thus, this study both revealed an inherent deficiency of mammalian cells in an important anti-oxidant repair process and identified a protein that can compensate for this deficiency. Preparation of Free Met-SO and Met-RO—Free Met-SO and Met-RO were prepared from mixed l-Met-R,S-sulfoxide (Sigma) according to the method of Lavine (23Lavine T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1947; 169: 477-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain diastereomers of higher purity, we repeated the separation process twice for each sulfoxide. Purity of Met-SO and Met-RO was assessed by an HPLC procedure using o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) (Sigma)-derivatized amino acids (7Sharov V.S. Ferrington D.A. Squier T.C. Schöneich C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) and found to exceed 98%. Cell Culture—SK-Hep1 (ATCC: HTB-52™) and fRMsr-transfected SK-Hep1 cells were cultured in DMEM or Met-free DMEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.1 mm Met, 0.1 mm Met-RO, 0.1 mm Met-SO, or 0.1 mm Met-RSO. The medium also contained 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and an antibiotics-antimycotic mixture (Invitrogen) of 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. In initial experiments, we examined media containing different amounts of Met and found that 0.1 mm Met was optimal and avoided Met deficiency. Thus, 0.1 mm Met sulfoxides were used in further experiments. Cell culture experiments, with the exception of a proliferation assay, were carried out in 6-well plates, and the cells were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Growth of SK-Hep1 cells was analyzed in modified DMEM containing Met, Met-SO, Met-RO, or Met-RSO (0.1 mm of each amino acid) or with no addition of these compounds. In addition, the media were supplemented or not with 100 nm sodium selenite. The cells were analyzed at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h. Another experiment involving SK-Hep1 cells was done with cells grown in serum-free modified DMEM, containing insulin (5 μg/ml) and transferrin (10 μg/ml), Met or Met-RSO (0.1 mm of each amino acid) and 100 nm sodium selenite (or with no addition of this compound), and separately in 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum-containing DMEM containing 0.1 mm Met with 100 nm sodium selenite (or not). The cells were analyzed at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h. Cell growth assays were carried out as described below. Proliferation Assay—Cell growth was quantified using colorimetric MTS assay (Promega). The cells in regular DMEM were plated in 96-well plates at 5 × 103 cells/well, washed with PBS, and specialized DMEM were added that contained Met, Met-SO, Met-RO, or Met-RSO 24 h after plating. To assay for cell proliferation, a tetrazolium compound (inner salt; MTS) and an electron coupling reagent (phenazine methosulfate) were mixed according to the manufacturer's protocol, and then 20 μl of the mixture were added to 100 μl of phenol red-excluded medium that further replaced cell culture medium. After 90 min of incubation at 37 °C in the atmosphere of 5% CO2, cell proliferation was measured at indicated time periods from 0 to 96 h at 450 nm in a plate reader. Direct counting of viable cells using 0.2% trypan blue was done in 6-well plates. An HPLC Analysis of Media Samples—The cells were plated in 6-well plates at 7.5 × 104 cells/well in 1.5 ml of regular DMEM. After 24 h, the cells were washed with PBS, and the medium was changed to modified DMEM containing Met, Met-SO, Met-RO, or Met-RSO (0.1 mm of each amino acid). 90 μl of medium from each well was collected at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h and mixed with 10 μl of 100% trichloroacetic acid. After incubation at 4 °C for 10 min and centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 15 min, the supernatant (50 μl) was diluted 10 times with distilled water and prepared for OPA derivatization. OPA derivatization of amino acids and HPLC analysis were performed as described (7Sharov V.S. Ferrington D.A. Squier T.C. Schöneich C. FEBS Lett. 1999; 455: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. The derivatization reagent was freshly prepared as a stock solution (40 mg of o-phthalaldehyde, 1 ml of methanol, 50 μl of 2-mercaptoehanol, 5 ml of 0.1 m Na2B4O7, pH 9.5) at room temperature in a capped amber vial. Sample solutions (2–5 μl) were mixed with the OPA derivatization reagent to a 100-μl final volume. Following a 2-min reaction at room temperature, the mixture was fractionated on a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C8 column (4.6×150 mm). Changes in Met levels in the fRMsr activity assay were similarly quantified. Detection was by fluorescence of Met derivatives using a Waters 474 scanning fluorescence detector with excitation at 330 nm and emission at 445 nm. Knockdown of MsrA in SK-Hep1 Cells by Small Interfering RNA—Double-stranded small interfering RNAs (Dharmacon) for targeting human MsrA mRNA were used to knockdown this gene in SK-Hep1 cells. The cells were transfected with small interfering RNA by using DharmaFECT™ 1 Transfection Reagent (Dharmacon) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Proliferation of these cells was assayed 60 h after transfection in comparison with control transfected cells. Transfection of Yeast fRMsr Gene into SK-Hep1 Cells—A His6 tag sequence was cloned at the C terminus of yeast fRMsr, the sequence was inserted into a mammalian expression vector, pCI-neo (Promega), and the resulting construct was verified by DNA sequencing. SK-Hep1 cells were transfected or cotransfected with the expression vector coding for fRMsr and pEGFP-N1 (Clontech) vector or with an empty pCI-neo vector and pEGFP-N1 vector using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's suggestion. To establish a stable cell line, the cells were selected in the presence of 800 μg/ml G418 sulfate (Promega) and further maintained in the presence of 400 μg/ml G418 sulfate. Expression of recombinant fRMsr was verified by Western blotting using anti-His tag antibodies, and Msr activities were assayed by an HPLC method using OPA derivatization. Cloning and Expression of Yeast fRMsr—Characterization of S. cerevisiae fRMsr (YKL069W) is described in a separate paper. 3D. T. Le, B. C. Lee, Y. Zhang, D. E. Fomenko, S. M. Marino, E. Hacioglu, G. H. Kwak, A. Koc, H. Y. Kim, and V. N. Gladyshev, submitted for publication. Briefly, a yeast fRMsr cDNA, which encodes a protein homologous to fRMsr from Escherichia coli, was amplified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae genomic DNA and subcloned into pET21b vector (Novagen) using primers 5′-AAACATATGATGGGCTCATCAACCGGGTTTC-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAGCGGCCGCGACACATGATTTATTAATTAATTTAGCAAG-3′ (antisense). After transformation into BL21 (DE3) E. coli, the subcloned sequence was verified by DNA sequencing. Cells with the plasmid in 500 ml of LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin were grown until A600 reached 0.6–0.8, followed by the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 0.3 mm. Protein expression was at 30 °C for 4 h, followed by harvesting cells by centrifugation at 4,000 rpm for 5 min. The cells were washed with PBS and stored at -70 °C until use. To purify the protein, cell pellet was dissolved in resuspension buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 15 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. After sonication, supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 30 min. The supernatant was loaded onto a cobalt Talon resin (Clontech) pre-equilibrated with resuspension buffer. Following washing with the same buffer, the protein was eluted with elution buffer (Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 300 mm imidazole, 300 mm NaCl). Fractions containing yeast fRMsr were pooled together and dialyzed overnight against PBS in a dialysis cassette (Pierce). Activity Assays of fRMsr—Reaction mixture (40 μl) included 50 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm substrate (Met-RO or Met-SO), and purified enzyme or cell lysate prepared by treatment with CelLytic™M cell lysis reagent (Sigma). 20 μl of the reaction mixture was mixed with 2 μl of trichloroacetic acid and subjected to OPA derivatization as described above and then injected onto the column to measure endogenous Met level in the samples. An additional 20 μl from the same original reaction mixture were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and then subjected to OPA derivatization by the same procedure using trichloroacetic acid. After derivatization of the sample (2–5 μl) by adding OPA solution to 100 μl as a final volume, 50 μl of the mixture were subjected to an HPLC separation as described above. Analysis of SK-Hep1 and fRMsr-transfected SK-Hep1 Cells—SK-Hep1 and fRMsr-transfected SK-Hep1 cells were plated in 6-well plates at 7.5 × 104 cells/well in regular DMEM. The medium was changed to Met-free DMEM supplemented with either Met or individual Met sulfoxides at 24 h after plating. The cells were then collected every 24 h until 96 h. Protein concentration was measured by the Bradford assay, and the samples were probed by standard immunoblot assays with polyclonal MsrA (kindly provided by Bertrand Friguet), cystathionine β synthase (CBS) (kindly provided by Ruma Banerjee), and activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies. Microscopy—A Nikon TE-300 microscope was used to prepare images of SK-Hep1 cells grown on different Met and Met sulfoxide media. Microscopy analyses were carried out in the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Microscopy Core Facility. 75Se Metabolic Labeling—SK-Hep1 cells were plated in 6-well plates at 7.5 × 104 cells/well in 1.5 ml of regular DMEM. After 24 h, the cells were washed with PBS, and the medium was changed to modified DMEM containing Met, Met-SO, Met-RO, or Met-RSO (0.1 mm of each amino acid). 0.01 mCi of freshly neutralized [75Se]selenious acid (specific activity, 1,000 Ci/mmol; University of Missouri Research Reactor) was added in each well at 48 h after changing the medium, and the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h in 5% CO2 atmosphere, followed by harvesting the cells. The cell extracts (30 μg of total protein) were electrophoresed on 10% Bis-Tris gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Invitrogen). The 75Se radioactivity pattern was visualized by using a PhosphorImager (GE Healthcare). Resistance of fRMsr-expressing and Control SK-Hep1 Cells to Oxidative Stress—SK-Hep1 cells stably transfected with either an empty pCI-neo vector and fRMsr construct were plated in 96-well plates at 3.0 × 104 cells/well. The medium was changed to a serum-free medium, and H2O2 was added to each well at indicated concentrations (0–1000 μm). Cell viability was measured by using colorimetric MTS assay. Mice—MsrA knock-out mice (16Moskovitz J. Bar-Noy S. Williams W.M. Requena J. Berlett B.S. Stadtman E.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 12920-12925Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) were kindly provided by Drs. Rodney Levine and Geumsoo Kim (National Institutes of Health). These mice and control C57BL6 mice were used for blood sampling. In addition, C57BL6 mice, which were subjected to selenium deficiency or a control diet containing 0.4 ppm Se in the form of sodium selenite for 8 months, were used. HPLC Analysis of Met-RO and Met-SO Level in Mouse Plasma—Mouse blood was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min. The supernatant was prepared for OPA derivatization without dilution following trichloroacetic acid precipitation and analyzed at isocratic flow rate of 2 min/ml at 89:11 (v/v) of 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.8 (solvent A) and methanol (solvent B) as described in the supplemental materials. SK-Hep1 Cells Grow in the Presence of Met and Met-SO, but Not in the Presence of Met-RO—To examine the capacity of mammalian cells to provide Met for cellular metabolism by Met sulfoxide reduction, human hepatoma SK-Hep1 cells were grown in Met-free DMEM supplemented with 0.1 mm Met, 0.1 mm Met-SO, 0.1 mm Met-RO, or 0.1 mm mixed Met-RO/Met-SO (Met-RSO) (Fig. 2A). SK-Hep1 hepatocytes grew best in the presence of Met and could also proliferate in Met-SO and Met-RSO media, although at a reduced rate. In contrast, Met-RO did not support the growth of SK-Hep1 cells. Morphology of cells maintained on Met-SO and Met-RO media was also different (see below). After 96 h on the Met-RO medium, SK-Hep1 hepatocytes were long and narrow, similar in shape to Met-restricted cells, whereas the cells grown on Met-SO resembled those maintained in the presence of Met. These data suggested that SK-Hep1 cells have a system for import and reduction of Met-SO, which provides them with Met, whereas these cells are unable to utilize free Met-RO. To determine whether Met, Met-RO, and Met-SO were consumed by SK-Hep1 hepatocytes, levels of these compounds were determined in each growth medium at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. For this purpose, we developed an HPLC procedure that utilized OPA derivatization of free amino acids following trichloroacetic acid precipitation of medium components (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. S1). We found this method to be superior to the currently available procedures for quantitative analysis of free Met sulfoxides and Met. It was recently reported (25Fukushima E. Shinka Y. Fukui T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 7134-7144Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) that many Met sulfoxide derivatives, such as widely used dabsyl chloride-reacted forms, are subject to nonenzymatic Met sulfoxide reduction at high temperatures, but the corresponding derivatization procedures themselves require heating. In contrast, the OPA derivatization process is completed at room temperature after 2–3 min, thus avoiding a heating step and associated nonenzymatic Met sulfoxide reduction. With this procedure, we found that relative amounts of Met in the Met-supplemented medium decreased to ∼60% of the initial level at 96 h. In contrast, Met-RO levels were not changed in Met-RO and Met-RSO media at any time points. Met-SO was decreased to 88% in the Met-SO-supplemented medium and to 77% in the Met-RSO medium (Fig. 2B). These data show that SK-Hep1 cells could import and consume both Met-SO and Met from the medium to support cell proliferation. On the other hand, consistent with the inability of SK-Hep1 cells to grow on Met-RO, this compound was not utilized. Moreover, when cells were grown on Met-RSO, only Met-SO was consumed. SK-Hep1 Cell Extracts Are Active in the Reduction of Met-SO but Do Not Reduce Met-RO—Because both MsrA and MsrB were reported to support low level reduction of free Met sulfoxides in in vitro assays (9Kim H.Y. Gladyshev V.N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), it was of interest to examine the contribution of these enzymes to Met sulfoxide reduction under physiological conditions in mammalian cells. We measured specific activities of SK-Hep1 cell extracts for the reduction of free Met-RO and Met-SO. No free Met-RO reductase activity was detected (it was within background), whereas the activity for free Met-SO reduction was ≈38.6 pmol/min/mg of protein (Table 1).TABLE 1Specific activities of SK-Hep1 cells towards free Met sulfoxides The table shows the values ± standard deviations from three independent experiments.Specific activity for each Met-OMet-ROMet-SOpmol/min/mgyfRMsrayfRMsr is yeast-free methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase30015 ± 2652NDbA signal corresponding to specific activity less than 5 pmol/min/mg is shown as ND (not detectable)SK-Hep1NDbA signal corresponding to specific activity less than 5 pmol/min/mg is shown as ND (not detectable)38.6 ± 3.6yfRMsr transfected SK-Hep146.4 ± 5.042.7 ± 5.9a yfRMsr is yeast-free methionine-R-sulfoxide reductaseb A signal corresponding to specific activity less than 5 pmol/min/mg is shown as ND (not detectable) Open table in a new tab Role of MsrA in the Reduction of Free Met-SO—To examine the role of MsrA in providing cells with Met by reduction of free Met-SO, we knocked down its expression by small interfering RNA. Decreased MsrA expression was verified by Western blot assays (Fig. 3A). We found that MsrA-deficient cells grew neither in Met-SO nor Met-RO medium, whereas Met still supported their growth. Thus, MsrA is responsible for the reduction of Met-SO acquired from the media by SK-Hep1 cells. These data also indicate that none of the three mammalian MsrB isozymes contributes significantly to the enzymatic reduction of free Met sulfoxides and to providing Met to support cell growth. A Yeast Enzyme Specific for Free Met-RO—A recent study identified a bacterial enzyme specific for free Met-RO (22Lin Z. Johnson L.C. Weissbach H. Brot N. Lively M.O. Lowther W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 9597-9602Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). This GAF domain-containing protein was designated as fRMsr. We analyzed sequence databases for homologs of this protein and found that mammals and other animals lack fRMsr. However, homologs of this protein were detected in many lower eukaryotes (supplemental Fig. S2).3 We cloned fRMsr homolog from S. cerevisiae and expressed it in E. coli as a His-tagged protein. The recombinant protein was soluble and had the expected molecular weight as determined by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry, whereas the native yeast protein functioned as fRMsr in S. cerevisiae cells.3 The recombinant yeast fRMsr protein exhibited high activity toward free Met-RO (≈33 nmol/min/mg of protein), whereas it was inactive with Met-SO as well as with dabsyl-Met-RO and dabsyl-Met-SO. Yeast fRMsr-expressing SK-Hep1 Cells Grow on Met-RO—Yeast fRMsr was stably expressed in SK-Hep1 cells in the form of His-tagged protein, and its expression was verified in Western blot assays with antibodies specific for His tag (Fig. 4A). Specific activity of fRMsr-transfected cells for Met-RO was ≈46.4 pmol/min/mg of protein, and the activity of these cells toward Met-SO was ≈42.7 pmol/min/mg of protein (Table 1). The transfected cells grew on Met-SO or Met-RO medium, and their growth was essentially indistinguishable from that of cells grown in the presence of Met (Fig. 4B). Morphology of fRMsr expressing cells on the Met-RO-supplemented medium was similar to that of cells grown on Met (Fig. 5). Thus, yeast fRMsr expressed in SK-Hep1 cells could reduce free Met-RO in quantities sufficient to compensate for Met deficiency. These data also indicated that Met-RO could be imported into SK-Hep1 cells from the medium.FIGURE 5Morphology of cells grown on sulfoxide media.

At higher concentrations of hydrogen peroxide (above 400 μm), fRMsr-expressing cells showed significantly higher viability than control cells (Fig. 4C). Thus, yeast fRMsr protected SK-Hep1 cells from oxidative stress caused by hydrogen peroxide treatment. The increased resistance of transfected cells to oxidative stress is likely because of reduction of free Met-RO formed by Met oxidation in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. In addition, these data indicate that reversible oxidation and reduction of free Met-RO (and by analogy free Met-SO) provides mammalian cells with an antioxidant defense system. MsrA and Selenoprotein Expression in Cells Grown on Met and Met Sulfoxide Media—We tested whether expression of MsrA is regulated by availability of Met or Met sulfoxides by maintaining cells in the corresponding growth media (Fig. 6A). Although levels of this enzyme slightly decreased after 96 h growth of SK-Hep1 cells, this change was observed in all samples, and we did not find significant differences in MsrA expression among samples examined. Thus, MsrA expression was not influenced by Met sulfoxide levels in cell culture media. We also tested whether the addition of Met sulfoxides regulates expression of selenoproteins, many of which are important antioxidant enzymes or redox regulators (Fig. 6B). We metabolically labeled SK-Hep1 cells with 75Se and examined selenoprotein patterns. No difference was observed among cells grown on Met, Met-RO, Met-SO, and Met-RSO media. The addition of selenium (100 nm sodium selenite) also did not influence cell growth on Met and Met sulfoxide in fetal bovine serum-supplemented and insulin/transferrin (supplemental Fig. S3) media. These data further argue against the role of selenoprotein MsrB1, which is a major peptide Met-RO reductase in mammals, in the reduction of free Met sulfoxides. CBS Expression in Cells Grown on Met and Met Sulfoxide Media—Met restriction in SK-Hep1 cells is known to reduce CBS levels by decreasing the availability of S-adenosylmethionine, which stabilizes CBS (4Prudova A. Bauman Z. Braun A. Vitvitsky V. Lu S.C. Banerjee R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 6489-6494Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Thus, this protein can be viewed as a marker of S-adenosylmethionine status (and therefore Met availability). We examined expression of CBS in cells grown on Met and Met sulfoxide media (Fig. 6, C and D). In the presence of Met-RO, SK-Hep1 cells reduced expression of this protein, whereas the cells grown on Met maintained stable CBS levels. In cells grown on the Met-SO medium, CBS levels were decreased, suggesting that although MsrA supports proliferation of SK-Hep1 cells by providing them with Met, these cells still suffer from Met deficiency (Fig. 6C). Interestingly, fRMsr-expressing cells grown on Met-RO had normal CBS levels (Fig. 6D). Thus, fRMsr can fully compensate for the lack of Met-RO reductase activity in SK-Hep1 hepatocytes and provide these cells with the full amount of Met needed for cellular metabolism. ATF3 Expression in Cells Grown on Met and Met Sulfoxide Media—ATF3 is known to be expressed at low levels in normal and quiescent cells but is rapidly induced by various stresses, such as amino acid deprivation, oxidative stress, and ER stress (26Pan Y. Chen H. Siu F. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 38402-38412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 27Okamoto A. Iwamoto Y. Maru Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 1087-1097Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). ATF3 is also relevant to the control of cell proliferation and pathway cross-talk regulation (24Tamura K. Hua B. Adachi S. Guney I. Kawauchi J. Morioka M. Tamamori-Adachi M. Tanaka Y. Nakabeppu Y. Sunamori M. Sedivy J.M. Kitajima S. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 2590-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Interestingly, SK-Hep1 cells grown on Met-RO for 72 h showed low expression levels of ATF3 as compared with cells on Met or Met-SO (Fig. 6E), suggesting that the cells grown on Met-RO had metabolic and proliferative defects caused by Met limitation. Importantly, SK-Hep1 cells being quiescent on Met-RO recovered normal metabolic function and the ability to proliferate when transfected with a construct coding for yeast fRMsr (Figs. 4B and 6F). Met-SO and Met-RO Levels in Mouse Plasma—To test whether differences in Met-SO and Met-RO consumption and reduction that were evident in cell culture experiments are also observed in an animal system, we analyzed Met-SO and Met-RO levels in mouse plasma. Met-SO was not detected in plasma of wild type mice, whereas Met-RO concentration was ≈9.1 ± 0.7 μm (quantified by providing known amounts of Met-RO and Met-SO standards to plasma samples) (Fig. 7 and supplemental Fig. S4). To test whether MsrA is responsible for the low systemic Met-SO in mouse blood, we further examined samples from MsrA knock-out mice. These mice had similar levels of Met-SO and Met-RO in plasma (Fig. 7 and supplemental Fig. S4). Met-SO concentration was found to be ≈14.6 ± 3.1 μm, and Met-RO concentration was ≈9.8 ± 1.6 μm (Fig. 7 and supplemental Fig. S4). These data show that deletion of MsrA caused a remarkable increase specifically in Met-SO levels, indicating that MsrA is responsible for the low levels of Met-SO in plasma of wild type mice. We also subjected wild type mice to selenium deficiency, which reduced MsrB1 to almost undetectable levels in liver (data not shown). Under these conditions, plasma Met-SO was ≈3.7 ± 0.6 μm, and Met-RO was ≈16.2 ± 2.4 μm (Fig. 7 and supplemental Fig. S4), indicating that both sulfoxides were slightly elevated. Besides MsrB1, several selenoproteins serve as antioxidant proteins and show reduced expression in selenium deficiency, resulting in increased oxidative stress. Thus, slight elevation in both Met-SO and Met-RO under conditions of low dietary selenium is due to an overall increased oxidative stress caused by systemic selenoprotein deficiency. Prior to this study, there was little understanding of the pathways for reduction of free Met-SO and Met-RO in mammalian cells. Although both Met residues and free Met are known to be susceptible to oxidation by ROS, and the reduction of Met sulfoxide residues is carried out by four enzymes in mammals, whether free Met sulfoxides are reduced or wasted was not known. Surprisingly, analysis of human SK-Hep1 hepatocytes grown on media containing Met, Met-RSO or individual Met sulfoxide diastereomers showed a significant difference in cell proliferation and Met sulfoxide consumption between Met-SO and Met-RO (Fig. 2). Met-SO, but not Met-RO, supported the growth of SK-Hep1 cells and was consumed from the medium. In addition, extracts of SK-Hep1 cells showed high free Met-SO reductase activity, whereas free Met-RO activity was not detected (Table 1). Certainly, MsrA was an obvious candidate for the role in free Met-SO reduction, and further experiments confirmed this idea because MsrA-deficient SK-Hep1 cells were no longer able to utilize free Met-SO and could not grow on either Met sulfoxide. These findings, as well as experiments with selenium deficiency and supplementation in SK-Hep1 hepatocytes, also demonstrated that none of the three mammalian MsrBs had a role in providing these cells with Met by enzymatic free Met sulfoxide reduction. We were able to extend these observations from cell culture to an animal model. Plasma samples from wild type mice had undetectable Met-SO, whereas the bulk of Met sulfoxide occurred in the form Met-RO (∼9 μm). Moreover, MsrA knock-out mice had both diastereomers at similar levels, indicating a specific elevation in Met-SO. Thus, not only hepatocytes, but also mice were deficient in Met-RO reduction and accumulated this compound in plasma. In addition, low levels of Met-SO were clearly caused by reduction of this compound by MsrA. We also found that subjecting wild type mice to selenium deficiency slightly elevated both diastereomers, likely because of increased oxidative stress caused by systemic selenoprotein deficiency. This finding again excluded the role of MsrB1 in the reduction of Met-RO in mice. A recent report by Lowther and co-workers (22Lin Z. Johnson L.C. Weissbach H. Brot N. Lively M.O. Lowther W.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 9597-9602Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) identified an enzyme, fRMsr, that catalyzes the reduction of free Met-RO in E. coli. However, our sequence analyses revealed that mammals lack this protein. Nevertheless, fRMsr homologs were detected in a variety of prokaryotes as well as in many single-celled eukaryotes. We characterized an fRMsr homolog from S. cerevisiae, which showed robust free Met-RO reductase activity. Furthermore, SK-Hep1 cells expressing this protein grew equally well on Met and Met-RSO media (Fig. 4B). Thus, fRMsr could fully compensate for inability of SK-Hep1 cells to reduce free Met-RO and could provide these cells with Met in quantities sufficient for cell growth. In addition, we observed increased resistance of fRMsr-expressing cells to hydrogen peroxide treatment, suggesting that reduction of free Met sulfoxides provides cells with antioxidant defense as previously proposed (15Stadtman E.R. Moskovitz J. Berlett B.S. Levine R.L. Mol. Cell Biochem. 2002; 234–235: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). In view of such an important function, it is puzzling why mammals lack fRMsr. Perhaps, environment at the time when animals evolved could have played a role. However, once the enzyme is lost, the ability for Met-RO reduction may be difficult to replace, and mammalian cells are now faced with this defect. In this regard, the finding that a yeast reductase fRMsr can fully compensate for the deficiency in Met-RO reduction could provide avenues for correcting this shortcoming in mammals and other animals. Met is an essential amino acid in mammals, which is exclusively derived from food sources and linked to many metabolic processes, including protein synthesis, methylation, sulfur metabolism, and ROS scavenging. In particular, Met metabolism has an important role in the synthesis of antioxidant compounds, such as cysteine, taurine, and GSH, through the transsulfuration pathway in liver, kidney, and small intestine. Thus, free Met plays a role in antioxidant defense not only by scavenging ROS (through reversible oxidation) but also as precursor of other antioxidant compounds. In conclusion, this work revealed an ability of mammalian cells to utilize free Met sulfoxides; however, of the two stereoisomers, only Met-SO is reduced in sufficient quantities, and this occurs in a MsrA-dependent manner. In contrast, mammals are deficient in the reduction of free Met-RO because of a loss of fRMsr in animals during evolution. Importantly, we found that this potential Achilles' heel of the mammalian anti-oxidant repair system could be addressed by expression of a yeast fRMsr, suggesting strategies for improved protection of mammals from oxidative stress and disease and for influencing the aging process.

It has also been implicated in numerous human malignancies. Signal transduction pathways shown to be of importance for c-Kit-mediated transformation include the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. We have previously shown that two alternative splice forms of c-Kit, denoted GNNK– and GNNK+, mediate distinctively different signals. In this study, we found that in the hematopoietic cell line Ba/F3, GNNK– c-Kit mediates a substantially stronger activation of PI3K/Akt than GNNK+ c-Kit. This difference in signaling was shown to be dependent on the association of the scaffolding protein Gab2 with c-Kit, and Src-mediated phosphorylation of Gab2 was shown to be to be independent of the direct association of PI3K with c-Kit. Furthermore, proliferation and survival of Ba/F3 cells expressing a mutant of c-Kit that fails to bind to PI3K directly were slightly decreased compared with wild-type c-Kit-expressing cells. Using small interfering RNA technology, we further verified a role of Gab2 in inducing activation of PI3K/Akt downstream of c-Kit. To summarize, we show that PI3K activation by c-Kit is both splice form-dependent and cell type-specific. Furthermore, activation of PI3K by c-Kit is dependent both on the direct PI3K-binding site in c-Kit and on the phosphorylation of Gab2. The fact that c-Kit has been found mutated in numerous human malignancies, including acute myeloid leukemia, and that Gab2 is often overexpressed in acute myeloid leukemia suggests a potential role of Gab2-mediated PI3K activation in transformation.

The receptor for stem cell factor (SCF), 2The abbreviations used are: SCF, stem cell factor; Erk, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; PE, phycoerythrin; IL-3, interleukin-3; SH, Src homology. c-Kit, is a type III receptor tyrosine kinase belonging to the same subfamily as the platelet-derived growth factor receptors, Flt3 (Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3), and the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (for review, see Ref. 1Rönnstrand L. CMLS Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2004; 61: 2535-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the c-kit gene is identical to the white spotting locus (W) in the mouse. Loss-of-function mutations in c-Kit lead to defects in melanogenesis, gametogenesis, and hematopoiesis. Stimulation of the c-Kit receptor with its ligand, SCF, leads to dimerization of receptors and activation of its intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Specific tyrosine residues are autophosphorylated, which results in the activation of downstream signaling pathways, including both positive and negative pathways. As a result of alternative mRNA splicing, four isoforms of c-Kit have been identified in humans and two in mice (2Reith A.D. Ellis C. Lyman S.D. Anderson D.M. Williams D.E. Bernstein A. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2451-2459Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 3Crosier P.S. Ricciardi S.T. Hall L.R. Vitas M.R. Clark S.C. Crosier K.E. Blood. 1993; 82: 1151-1158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In both mice and humans, alternative splicing results in isoforms characterized by the presence or absence of a tetrapeptide sequence, GNNK, in the extracellular part of the juxtamembrane region. Variants GNNK+ and GNNK– (also denoted KitA and KitB, respectively) are coexpressed in most tissues, with the GNNK– form predominating (4Piao X. Curtis J.E. Minkin S. Minden M.D. Bernstein A. Blood. 1994; 83: 476-481Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In NIH3T3 cells transfected with either isoform of c-Kit, it was demonstrated that upon ligand stimulation, the GNNK– isoform was more strongly tyrosine-phosphorylated and more rapidly internalized. Furthermore, it activated Erk more strongly than the GNNK+ isoform, whereas the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) was at similar level in the two splice forms (5Voytyuk O. Lennartsson J.

However, because c-Kit is not normally expressed in fibroblasts, but rather plays an important role in hematopoietic cells, we chose to study how the two splice forms of c-Kit signal in the pro-B cell line Ba/F3 to determine the role of alternatively spliced c-Kit in a more physiological setting. Activation of PI3K by c-Kit has been linked to mitogenesis, differentiation, survival, adhesion, secretion, and actin cytoskeletal reorganization. In c-Kit, Tyr721 has been found to directly interact with PI3K (6Serve H. Hsu Y.C. Besmer P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6026-6030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was initially claimed to be essential for PI3K activation (7Serve H. Yee N.S. Stella G. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Tan J.C. Besmer P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, it was later shown that in addition to the direct recruitment of PI3K to c-Kit, also the indirect recruitment via Gab2 is important for full PI3K activation (8Nishida K. Wang L. Morii E. Park S.J. Narimatsu M. Itoh S. Yamasaki S. Fujishima M. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Kitamura Y. Hirano T. Blood. 2002; 99: 1866-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 9Yu M. Luo J. Yang W. Wang Y.

The scaffolding protein Gab2 is expressed in many tissues, including brain, kidney, lung heart, bone marrow, testis, and ovary, and has been found to be a positive mediator of cytokine and growth factor signaling (for review, see Ref. 10Gu H. Neel B.G. Trends Cell Biol. 2003; 13: 122-130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). It can be activated by c-Kit and was found to be required for mast cell development and function (8Nishida K. Wang L. Morii E. Park S.J. Narimatsu M. Itoh S. Yamasaki S. Fujishima M. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Kitamura Y. Hirano T. Blood. 2002; 99: 1866-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 11Nishida K. Yoshida Y. Itoh M. Fukada T. Ohtani T. Shirogane T. Atsumi T. Takahashi-Tezuka M. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Hirano T. Blood. 1999; 93: 1809-1816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). SCF-induced Erk and Akt activation is decreased in Gab2-deficient bone marrow-derived mast cells (8Nishida K. Wang L. Morii E. Park S.J. Narimatsu M. Itoh S. Yamasaki S. Fujishima M. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Kitamura Y. Hirano T. Blood. 2002; 99: 1866-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), which indicates a role of Gab2 in PI3K/Akt activation. c-Kit promotes cell survival via several mechanisms. PI3K-dependent activation of Akt and phosphorylation of Bad, a pro-apoptotic molecule, at Ser136 in vivo lead to its binding to 14-3-3 protein and sequestering from the anti-apoptotic molecule BclxL. Akt has also been shown to phosphorylate Foxo transcription factors, leading to their exclusion from the nucleus and inability to act in pro-apoptotic signaling (12Möller C. Alfredsson J. Engström M. Wootz H. Xiang Z. Lennartsson J. Jönsson J.I. Nilsson G. Blood. 2005; 106: 1330-1336Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Using immortalized murine progenitor cells transduced with the Y721F/D816V mutant of c-Kit, Chian et al. (13Chian R. Young S. Danilkovitch-Miagkova A. Rönnstrand L. Leonard E. Ferrao P. Ashman L. Linnekin D. Blood. 2001; 98: 1365-1373Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) showed that transformation by this constitutively active form of c-Kit is dependent on PI3K. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of splice form-specific signaling of c-Kit in a hematopoietic cell line, Ba/F3, and found that in contrast to our previous findings in fibroblasts (5Voytyuk O. Lennartsson J. Mogi A. Caruana G. Courtneidge S. Ashman L.K. Rönnstrand L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9159-9166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), the GNNK– isoform of c-Kit mediates a markedly stronger activation of PI3K than the GNNK+ isoform. We further demonstrate that this difference arises from differential activation of Src family kinases and subsequent phosphorylation of Gab2. By mutating the direct PI3K-binding site in c-Kit, we show that the splice form-specific effect is not mediated through differences in direct association between the two splice forms. We further demonstrate that binding and phosphorylation of Gab2 require interaction with c-Kit through indirect binding via the adapter protein Grb2 to Tyr703 and Tyr936 in c-Kit. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA) against Gab2, we show that knockdown of Gab2 expression leads to a significant reduction in PI3K activation. To summarize, we demonstrate splice form-specific differences in PI3K signaling that could have consequences for the mode of activation of PI3K by c-Kit in transformed cells and provide a target for future therapeutic intervention with c-Kit signaling in tumors. Antibodies and Peptide—Recombinant human SCF was purchased from ProSpec-Tany TechnoGene Ltd. (Rehovot, Israel).

To establish c-Kit-expressing Ba/F3 and 32D cell lines, EcoPack cells were transfected with wild-type and variant mutant c-Kit constructs on pMSCVpuro, respectively; supernatants were collected to infect Ba/F3 or 32D cells, followed by a 2-week selection in puromycin. Expression of c-Kit was confirmed by flow cytometry and immunoblotting. c-Kit-expressing Ba/F3 and 32D cells were grown in the same medium as Ba/F3 and 32D cells but supplemented with 1.2 μg/ml puromycin. Cell Stimulation, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blotting—Ba/F3 and 32D cells were starved of IL-3 and serum for 5 h and stimulated with 100 ng/ml SCF for the indicated times. NIH3T3 cells were serum-starved overnight. Cells were washed once in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, and processed for immunoprecipitation and Western blotting as described (5Voytyuk O.

Immunodetection was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence using the SuperSignal Dura reagent and a CCD camera (LAS3000, Fujifilm). Electroporation of siRNA—Silencing of Gab2 in c-Kit-expressing Ba/F3 cells was achieved by electroporation (300 V, 1500 microfarads) in a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad) in the presence of 100 nm Gab2 siRNA. Cells were incubated in the Ba/F3 growth medium for 12 h, starved for 5 h, stimulated with SCF, and lysed. Cell Survival Assay—Cells were washed three times, resuspended in Ba/F3 complete medium without IL-3, and then seeded in 6-well plates containing 100 ng/ml SCF. Cells were seeded with 10 ng/ml IL-3 or without any cytokine as a control. After a 48-h incubation, cells were stained using the annexin V-PE apoptosis detection kit. Living cells, apoptotic cells, and dead cells were quantified by flow cytometry. The Alternative Splice Form GNNK– Mediates a Much Stronger Activation of PI3K than the GNNK+ Isoform in Ba/F3 Cells—In a previous study (5Voytyuk O. Lennartsson J. Mogi A. Caruana G. Courtneidge S. Ashman L.K. Rönnstrand L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9159-9166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), we showed in transfected NIH3T3 cells that there was no quantitative difference in the phosphorylation of Tyr721 of c-Kit, the binding site for PI3K, or in the activation of PI3K between the two splice forms GNNK– and GNNK+, respectively. However, because c-Kit is normally not expressed in fibroblasts, we sought to study the role of the two splice forms in a more relevant cell type. For this purpose, we chose the pro-B cell line Ba/F3, which was retrovirally transduced with either splice form of c-Kit. Equal expression of c-Kit was verified by flow cytometry (Fig. 1). Cells were stimulated with SCF, followed by lysis and separation by SDS-PAGE and electrotransfer to Immobilon P. The filter was probed with antibody against phosphorylated Akt (Ser473). In parallel, c-Kit was immunoprecipitated from lysates and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with antibodies against phosphotyrosine and c-Kit. Akt was rapidly and strongly phosphorylated by the GNNK– isoform of c-Kit after stimulation with SCF, whereas the Akt phosphorylation was slower and weaker in cells expressing the GNNK+ isoform (Fig. 2A). Similar kinetics of Akt phosphorylation were seen in the myeloid cell line 32D transduced with the GNNK– and GNNK+ isoforms, respectively (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation between the p85 subunit of PI3K and c-Kit was stronger and showed faster kinetics in cells expressing the GNNK– isoform compared with the GNNK+ isoform (Fig. 2D). This is in strong contrast to the kinetics of Akt phosphorylation in NIH3T3 fibroblasts transduced with the GNNK– and GNNK+ isoforms, respectively, where both isoforms of c-Kit elicited a response to the same level, although with slightly different kinetics (Fig. 2C) (5Voytyuk O.

However, whereas the overall tyrosine phosphorylation and the phosphorylation of the Src-binding site in c-Kit (Tyr568) were higher in the GNNK– isoform, the direct binding site (Tyr721) showed similar levels of phosphorylation in both isoforms (Fig. 2D).

To evaluate its importance in SCF-stimulated PI3K activation, we generated two mutants of c-Kit that block the direct binding of p85 to c-Kit; Y721F blocks any protein binding to phosphorylated Tyr721, whereas M724A is more selective for PI3K (16Songyang Z.

The Y721F and M724A mutants of c-Kit blocked binding of p85 to either isoform of c-Kit, as expected (Fig. 3). However, the M724A mutant of either splice form of c-Kit was able to mediate phosphorylation of Akt despite its inability to associate with PI3K (Fig. 4). This suggests that additional pathways, apart from the direct binding of PI3K to c-Kit, mediate PI3K activation.FIGURE 4Loss of direct binding of PI3K to c-Kit leads to a partial reduction in Akt activation in either splice form of c-Kit.

All cell lines showed SCF-dependent proliferation, with the cell lines expressing the GNNK– isoform of c-Kit growing much faster than cells expressing GNNK+ (Fig. 5A). Blocking the direct binding of PI3K by the M724A mutant led to a decreased growth rate. Cell survival assays were performed on the same cell lines using an annexin V-PE apoptosis detection kit (Fig. 5B). The data showed that cells expressing the M724A mutant of c-Kit, despite its inability to bind PI3K, could still survive in the presence of SCF, although cell death was increased. These data clearly indicate that the two splice forms of c-Kit differ in their ability to mediate cell growth and survival and that the direct binding of PI3K to c-Kit contributes to cell growth, but is not absolutely required for cell survival. c-Kit Activates the PI3K/Akt Pathway via Gab2—To assess how the two isoforms of c-Kit activate the PI3K/Akt pathway without direct binding to PI3K, Ba/F3 cells expressing wild-type c-Kit or the Met724 mutant of either isoform were stimulated with SCF, and cell lysates were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies against the regulatory subunit p85 or the catalytic subunit p110 of PI3K and then probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 to detect binding partners of PI3K other than c-Kit. One potential candidate is the scaffolding protein Gab2. The blotting result showed that both c-Kit and Gab2 could bind to p85 and p110 after SCF stimulation of c-Kit. Furthermore, the M724A mutation did not affect the binding between Gab2 and p85 or p110 (Fig. 6). This indicates that PI3K can be activated by c-Kit either through direct recruitment to c-Kit or through indirect binding via Gab2. To elucidate the role of Gab2 in SCF-stimulated PI3K/Akt activation, Gab2 siRNA was introduced into Ba/F3 cells expressing c-Kit/M724A to knock down the expression of Gab2. This led to the suppression of Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 7), suggesting again that PI3K activation by c-Kit is mediated both through the direct binding to c-Kit and through the indirect association with Gab2. Filters were also probed with antibodies against Gab1, but it was found to be negative (data not shown). This is in agreement with a previous report (17Nguyen M.H. Ho J.M. Beattie B.K. Barber D.L. J.

Ba/F3 cells expressing either of the two isoforms of c-Kit carrying the specific p85-binding mutation M724A were electroporated with Gab2 siRNA to knock down the expression of Gab2. After incubation overnight in cell growth medium, cells were starved, followed by stimulation with SCF. Cells were lysed, and the total cell lysate (TCL) was separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to Immobilon P or subjected to immunoprecipitation (IP) with antibody against Gab2.

To investigate this possibility, Ba/F3 cells expressing either isoform of c-Kit were stimulated with SCF, subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibody against Gab2, and probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies. Fig. 8 clearly demonstrates that GNNK– strongly and rapidly phosphorylated Gab2, whereas the phosphorylation of Gab2 was much weaker in the GNNK+ isoform of c-Kit. Gab2 is known to be able to complex with p85, SHP2, Shc, and Grb2. Because Gab2 is known to associate with Grb2 via proline-rich regions of Gab2 and the SH3 domains of Grb2, we investigated whether Grb2 could act as an adapter bringing Gab2 to c-Kit. Grb2 binds to c-Kit through Tyr703 and Tyr936 (18Thömmes K. Lennartsson J. Carlberg M. Rönnstrand L. Biochem. J. 1999; 341: 211-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 19Sun J. Pedersen M. Bengtsson S. Rönnstrand L. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 3935-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Using the N705A/N938A mutant of c-Kit, which fails to bind to Grb2, and the Src family kinase-selective inhibitor SU6656, we investigated the requirements for c-Kit-mediated Gab2 phosphorylation. These experiments showed that phosphorylation of Gab2 was dependent on intact Grb2-binding sites in c-Kit and intact Src family kinase activity (Fig. 9A). To assess the importance of Grb2/Gab2 binding to c-Kit and Src family kinases in the activation of PI3K, a parallel experiment was performed probing for phospho-Akt (Fig. 9B). The combination of both the Grb2-binding mutant and the Src family kinase inhibitor blocked Gab2 phosphorylation as well as Akt phosphorylation. From this result, we hypothesize that Grb2 can bring Gab2 to c-Kit through the binding of Grb2 to Tyr703 and Tyr936 of c-Kit, which then is phosphorylated through the action of Src family kinases. Phosphorylated Gab2 recruits the p85-p110 complex and activates the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.FIGURE 9SCF-stimulated phosphorylation of Gab2 and Akt phosphorylation require both intact Grb2-binding sites on c-Kit and Src family kinase activity. Ba/F3 cells expressing either splice form of c-Kit with or without the Grb2-binding mutation N705A/N938A were starved for 5 h and incubated with the Src-selective inhibitor SU6656 for 30 min, followed by SCF stimulation.

IB, immunoblot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The SCF receptor/c-Kit is known to undergo alternative splicing, leading to the existence of at least six different isoforms of c-Kit in mice and humans. Two of these splice forms, GNNK– and GNNK+, exist as a result of alternative splice acceptor site usage and lead to the absence or presence of a tetrapeptide sequence, GNNK, in the extracellular part of the juxtamembrane region. We and others have previously shown that the two splice forms differ dramatically in signaling downstream of c-Kit (5Voytyuk O. Lennartsson J. Mogi A. Caruana G. Courtneidge S. Ashman L.K.

Signal. 2007; 19: 2572-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Although both isoforms are reported to bind SCF with equal affinity, the GNNK– isoform responds to SCF with a rapid and strong activation of its intrinsic kinase activity as well as Src family kinase activity. In contrast, GNNK+ responses are slower and weaker, and this seems to be due to a lower degree of activation of Src family kinases (5Voytyuk O. Lennartsson J. Mogi A. Caruana G. Courtneidge S. Ashman L.K. Rönnstrand L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9159-9166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). It is both a qualitative and quantitative difference in signaling between the two splice forms. Probing of the receptor isoforms with phospho-specific antibodies revealed considerably higher levels of Tyr568 phosphorylation in the GNNK– isoform, whereas phosphorylation of Tyr721 was at similar levels in both isoforms (Fig. 2D) (5Voytyuk O.

The mechanisms by which these differences in signaling arise are incompletely known. From the structural data obtained through x-ray crystallography of the extracellular domain of c-Kit, one region has been identified that is involved in stabilization of ligand-induced receptor dimers (22Yuzawa S. Opatowsky Y. Zhang Z. Mandiyan V. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 2007; 130: 323-334Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). It is possible, but remains to be shown, that the absence or presence of the GNNK sequence in this region influences dimer stability. The initial studies on how the two alternative splice forms of c-Kit signal were all performed on transfected NIH3T3 cells. However, c-Kit is normally not expressed in fibroblasts, and some important signal transduction molecules might be missing in fibroblasts. In this work, we studied the signaling of the two alternative splice forms in the pro-B cell line Ba/F3. We have demonstrated that, in contrast to what is seen in transfected NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2C) (5Voytyuk O. Lennartsson J. Mogi A. Caruana G. Courtneidge S. Ashman L.K. Rönnstrand L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 9159-9166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), phosphorylation of Akt downstream of c-Kit is considerably stronger in the GNNK– isoform (Fig. 2A). This occurs despite the fact that the phosphorylation of the direct binding site for PI3K, Tyr721, is phosphorylated to a similar extent in cells expressing either isoform of c-Kit (Fig. 2D). We also found the same to be true for the myeloid cell line 32D transfected with either the GNNK– or GNNK+ isoform of c-Kit (Fig. 2B). This is in contrast to recent findings by Young et al. (21Young S.M. Cambareri A.C. Odell A. Geary S.M. Ashman L.K. Cell. Signal. 2007; 19: 2572-2581Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), who studied c-Kit signaling in the murine FDC-P1 early myeloid cell line and Myb-immortalized hematopoietic cells and found marginal differences in PI3K association with c-Kit as well as in Akt phosphorylation. An early study on c-Kit-mediated PI3Ks indicated the crucial importance of phosphorylated Tyr721 for activation of PI3K (7Serve H. Yee N.S. Stella G. Sepp-Lorenzino L. Tan J.C. Besmer P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). However, the experiments were performed many times on the activity of PI3K physically associated with c-Kit and not the total cellular activity of PI3K. In this study, we have shown that mutation of Tyr721 only partially reduces SCF-dependent Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 4) in both GNNK– and GNNK+ isoforms. PI3K is known to be important for survival and proliferation of cells in a number of settings (23Blume-Jensen P. Janknecht R. Hunter T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 779-782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate the impact of direct PI3K association with c-Kit on proliferation and survival, we performed 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assays on Ba/F3 cells transfected with either wild-type or M724A mutant c-Kit (which fails to bind PI3K). As shown in Fig. 5A, loss of direct binding of PI3K to either splice form of c-Kit had only a marginal effect on SCF-mediated cell proliferation. Scoring for SCF-induced survival of these cells under conditions of IL-3 starvation demonstrated a partial effect on cell survival in either splice form of c-Kit (Fig. 5B). In contrast, treatment with a pharmacological inhibitor of PI3K has been shown to efficiently induce apoptosis of c-Kit-expressing cells (24Karlsson R. Engström M. Jönsson M. Karlberg P. Pronk C.J. Richter J. Jönsson J.I. J. Leukocyte Biol. 2003; 74: 923-931Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Given the importance of PI3K in c-Kit-mediated survival, alternative pathways for activation of PI3K are likely to exist. Recent studies have reported the importance of the scaffolding protein Gab2 in c-Kit signaling. Gab2 is a scaffolding protein containing a pleckstrin homology domain, proline-rich sequences, and several tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated upon growth factor or cytokine stimulation, leading to recruitment of downstream signal transduction molecules (for review, see Ref. 25Nishida K. Hirano T. Cancer Sci. 2003; 94: 1029-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Using targeted deletion of the gab2 locus in mice, Nishida et al. (8Nishida K. Wang L. Morii E. Park S.J. Narimatsu M. Itoh S. Yamasaki S. Fujishima M. Ishihara K. Hibi M. Kitamura Y. Hirano T. Blood. 2002; 99: 1866-1869Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) noted a decrease in mast cell numbers in Gab2-deficient mice. Furthermore, SCF-stimulated Erk phosphorylation was markedly reduced in bone marrow-derived mast cells from such mice, indicating its importance in c-Kit signaling. Gab2 has been shown to regulate SCF-stimulated mast cell proliferation via SHP2-dependent activation of the Rac/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway (9Yu M. Luo J. Yang W. Wang Y. Mizuki M. Kanakura Y. Besmer P. Neel B.G. Gu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28615-28626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). It was further demonstrated that mutation of Tyr719 (corresponding to Tyr721 in the human sequence), the direct binding site of PI3K, did not fully inhibit PI3K activation in bone marrow-derived mast cells, but that Gab2 also could contribute to PI3K activation. In this study, we have shown that in Ba/F3 cells, c-Kit-induced activation of PI3K is mediated to about equal extents by the direct binding to c-Kit through Tyr721 and by the Src-dependent phosphorylation of Gab2 (Figs. 4 and 9). This is also consistent with the data obtained by Yu et al. (9Yu M. Luo J. Yang W. Wang Y. Mizuki M. Kanakura Y. Besmer P. Neel B.G. Gu H. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 28615-28626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), who demonstrated a dramatic reduction in Gab2 phosphorylation in bone marrow-derived mast cells expressing the Tyr567 (corresponding to Tyr568 in the human sequence) mutant of c-Kit that fails to activate Src family kinases. Association between Gab2 and receptor tyrosine kinases has in most cases been shown to occur indirectly through the adapter protein Grb2. Gab2 contains proline-rich sequences to which Grb2 binds through its SH3 domains, and the SH2 domain of Grb2 associates with phosphorylated tyrosine residues on the receptor tyrosine kinase. We have recently demonstrated that Grb2 in living cells associates with c-Kit through phosphorylated Tyr703 and Tyr936 (19Sun J. Pedersen M. Bengtsson S. Rönnstrand L. Exp. Cell Res. 2007; 313: 3935-3942Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Because binding of Grb2 to phosphorylated tyrosine residues is dependent on an asparagine residue in position +2 relative to the phosphorylated tyrosine residues, we employed the c-Kit double mutant N705A/N938A to block binding of Grb2 to c-Kit. Fig. 9 clearly demonstrates that SCF-induced phosphorylation of Gab2 was dependent on these two Grb2-binding sites. To verify that Gab2 is indeed important for SCF-stimulated Akt activation, we used siRNA to selectively knock down expression of Gab2 (Fig. 7). Knockdown of Gab2 expression in combination with the M724A mutant of c-Kit further decreased Akt phosphorylation in both splice forms of c-Kit. To summarize, we have found that the two splice forms of c-Kit, GNNK– and GNNK+, differ in a cell type-specific manner in their mode of activation of PI3K/Akt. In the pro-B cell line Ba/F3 transfected with c-Kit, PI3K activation is dependent on the direct binding site in c-Kit, Tyr721, the association of the scaffolding protein Gab2 with c-Kit through Grb2, and Src-dependent phosphorylation of Gab2, whereas in NIH3T3 cells, it is dependent solely on phosphorylated Tyr721. The physiological function of PI3K in c-Kit signaling has been studied in mice expressing the Y721F mutant of c-Kit, giving rise to a phenotype with either defective spermatogenesis or defects in both spermatogenesis and oogenesis (26Blume-Jensen P. Jiang G. Hyman R. Lee K.F. O'Gorman S. Hunter T. Nat. Genet. 2000; 24: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 27Kissel H. Timokhina I. Hardy M.P. Rothschild G. Tajima Y. Soares V. Angeles M. Whitlow S.R. Manova K. Besmer P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 1312-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar) without affecting other c-Kit functions. It is tempting to speculate that these phenotypes might not fully reflect the function of PI3K in c-Kit signaling, but may be the result of tissues not expressing high enough levels of Gab2 to rescue the Y721F phenotype. However, this remains to be shown. Other studies targeting various isoforms of PI3K in mice have demonstrated an importance of the p110δ isoform of PI3K in mast cells. Expression of a catalytically compromised mutant of p110δ in transgenic mice led to defective SCF-mediated in vitro proliferation, adhesion, and migration and to impaired allergen-IgE-induced degranulation and cytokine release (28Ali K. Bilancio A. Thomas M. Pearce W. Gilfillan A.M. Tkaczyk C. Kuehn N. Gray A. Giddings J. Peskett E. Fox R. Bruce I. Walker C. Sawyer C. Okkenhaug K. Finan P. Vanhaesebroeck B. Nature. 2004; 431: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Future studies are aiming at investigating the role of splice form-specific activation of PI3K and other signal transduction molecules in other cell type, such as melanocytes. Given the recently demonstrated occurrence of activating mutations of c-Kit in a subtype of melanoma (29Antonescu C.R. Busam K.J. Francone T.D. Wong G.C. Guo T. Agaram N.P. Besmer P. Jungbluth A.

https://openalex.org/W2143585591,"Neurons are highly polarized cells, and neuron-neuron communication is based on directed transport and release of neurotransmitters, neuropeptides, and neurotrophins. Directed communication may also be attributed to neuron-microglia signaling, since neuronal damage can induce a microglia reaction at specific sites only. However, the mechanism underlying this site-specific microglia reaction is not yet understood. Neuronal CCL21 is a microglia-activating chemokine, which in brain is solely found in endangered neurons and is therefore a candidate for neuron-microglia signaling. Here we present that neuronal CCL21 is sorted into large dense-core vesicles, the secretory granules of the regulated release pathway of neurons. Live-cell imaging studies show preferential sorting of CCL21-containing vesicles into axons, indicating its directed transport. Thus, mouse neurons express and transport a microglia activating factor very similar to signaling molecules used in neuron-neuron communication. These data show for the first time the directed transport of a microglia activating factor in neurons and corroborate the function of neuronal CCL21 in directed neuron-microglia communication."
https://openalex.org/W2073256831,"Laminins are the major cell adhesive proteins in basement membranes, and consist of three subunits termed alpha, beta, and gamma. Recently, we found that the Glu residue at the third position from the C termini of the gamma1 and gamma2 chains is critically involved in integrin binding by laminins. However, the gamma3 chain lacks this Glu residue, suggesting that laminin isoforms containing the gamma3 chain may be unable to bind to integrins. To address this possibility, we expressed the E8 fragment of laminin-213 and found that it was incapable of binding to integrins. Similarly, the E8 fragment of laminin-113 was expressed and also found to be inactive in binding to integrins, confirming the distinction between the integrin binding activities of gamma3 chain-containing isoforms and those containing the gamma1 or gamma2 chain. To further address the importance of the Glu residue, we swapped the C-terminal four amino acids of the gamma3 chain with the C-terminal nine amino acids of the gamma1 chain, which contain the Glu residue. The resulting chimeric E8 fragment of laminin-213 became fully active in integrin binding, whereas replacement with the nine amino acids of the gamma1 chain after substitution of Gln for the conserved Glu residue failed to restore the integrin binding activity. These results provide both loss-of-function and gain-of-function evidence that laminin isoforms containing the gamma3 chain are unable to bind to integrins due to the absence of the conserved Glu residue, which should play a critical role in integrin binding by laminins."

Cyclin D1 was induced by low-dose ionizing radiation (LDIR; 10-cGy X-ray) in human keratinocytes with an adaptive radioresistance that can be inhibited by short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated cyclin D1 inhibition. Cyclin D1 was found to form complex with chaperon 14-3-3ζ in unstressed cells and mutation of 14-3-3ζ Ser-58 to Asp (S58D) significantly impaired 14-3-3ζ binding to cyclin D1. The formation of cyclin D1/14-3-3ζ complex was differently regulated by exposure to low (10-cGy X-ray) versus high (5-Gy γ-ray) doses of radiation. Unlike exposure to 5-Gy that predominantly enhanced cyclin D1 nuclear accumulation, LDIR induced the dissociation of the cyclin D1/14-3-3ζ complex without nuclear translocation, indicating that cytosolic accumulation of cyclin D1 was required for LDIR-induced adaptive response. Further studies revealed a direct interaction of cyclin D1 with proapoptotic Bax and an improved mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) in LDIR-treated cells. Consistently, blocking cyclin D1/Bax formation by cyclin D1 siRNA reversed Δψm and inhibited the LDIR-associated antiapoptotic response. These results demonstrate the evidence that cytosolic cyclin D1 is able to regulate apoptosis by interaction with Bax in LDIR-induced adaptive resistance."

Moreover, it is known that Plk1 kinase activity is also regulated at the post-translational level through phosphorylation. However, the upstream kinases of Plk1 have not been identified. Although the involvement of the p38 MAP kinase pathway in cellular responses to stress has been well documented, the role of this pathway in normal cell cycle progression is unclear. Here, we show that phosphorylated p38 and MAP kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2) are colocalized with Plk1 to the spindle poles during prophase and metaphase. Specific depletion of various members of the p38 MAP kinase pathway by the use of RNA interference revealed that the pathway is required for mitotic progression under normal growth conditions. Furthermore, MK2 directly phosphorylates Ser326 of Plk1. Ectopic expression of Plk1-S326A completely blocked cells at mitosis, likely due to the defect of bipolar spindle formation and subsequent activation of the spindle checkpoint. Only Plk1-S326E, but not the Plk1-S326A, efficiently rescued the p38 or MK2-depletion-induced mitotic defects, further solidifying the requirement of S326 phosphorylation during mitotic progression."

Genetic variations in the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene alter hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity and associate with hypertension and susceptibility to metabolic disease. Here we test the hypothesis that reduced GR density alters blood pressure and glucose and lipid homeostasis and limits adaption to obesogenic diet. Heterozygous GRßgeo/+ mice were generated from embryonic stem (ES) cells with a gene trap integration of a β-galactosidase-neomycin phosphotransferase (βgeo) cassette into the GR gene creating a transcriptionally inactive GR fusion protein. Although GRßgeo/+ mice have 50% less functional GR, they have normal lipid and glucose homeostasis due to compensatory HPA axis activation but are hypertensive due to activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). When challenged with a high-fat diet, weight gain, adiposity, and glucose intolerance were similarly increased in control and GRßgeo/+ mice, suggesting preserved control of intermediary metabolism and energy balance. However, whereas a high-fat diet caused HPA activation and increased blood pressure in control mice, these adaptions were attenuated or abolished in GRßgeo/+ mice. Thus, reduced GR density balanced by HPA activation leaves glucocorticoid functions unaffected but mineralocorticoid functions increased, causing hypertension.

A series of spin labeled mutants were engineered in NpHtrII157, a truncated analog containing only the first HAMP domain following the transmembrane helix 2. This truncated transducer is shown to be a valid model system for a signal transduction domain anchored to the transmembrane light sensor NpSRII. The HAMP domain is found to be engaged in a ""two-state"" equilibrium between a highly dynamic (dHAMP) and a more compact (cHAMP) conformation. The structural properties of the cHAMP as proven by mobility, accessibility, and intra-transducer-dimer distance data are in agreement with the four helical bundle NMR model of the HAMP domain from Archaeoglobus fulgidus."

Key cellular processes such as DNA replication, DNA repair, RNA processing, and RNA degradation require the rapid hydrolysis of the phosphate diester linkages of nucleic acids. The uncatalyzed hydrolysis of phosphate diesters under biological conditions is an extremely slow process with an estimated half-life of 30 million years at 25 °C (1Schroeder G.K. Lad C. Wyman P.

Protein nucleases and RNA enzymes produce rate enhancements of 1015-1017 to allow this reaction to proceed on a biologically useful time scale. Most enzymes catalyzing phosphate diester bond hydrolysis have a requirement for divalent metal ions.

The position of metal 1 is similar in all cases, but the metal 2 location varies. In all but one structure of human FEN (hFEN), the spacing of these metal ions exceeds that demanded by a two-metal-ion mechanism, which needs to be ≤4 Å for the two ions to bind the same oxygen atom (Fig. 1a). Only two structures of enzyme-DNA complexes exist, but neither contain bound metal ions (8Devos J.M. Tomanicek S.J. Jones C.E. Nossal N.G. Mueser T.J. J. Biol.

To investigate the roles played by metal ions in the FEN reaction, we have carried out a detailed evaluation of the magnesium ion response of T5FEN, and of the inhibition of magnesium- and manganese ion-supported reactions by calcium ions. Together the data suggest that the major acceleration of phosphate diester hydrolysis requires at least two viable cofactor ions, and so could utilize a two-metal-ion mechanism, but that the metallobiochemistry of T5FEN is more complex and overall involves at least three metal ions. Materials—T5FEN was purified to homogeneity as described (18Sayers J.R. Eckstein F. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18311-18317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HP5F substrate (5′-FAM-pd(CGCTGTCGAACACACGCTTGCGTGTGTTC)) was prepared as described (19Williams R. Sengerová B. Osborne S. Syson K. Ault S. Kilgour A. Chapados B.R. Tainer J.A. Sayers J.R. Grasby J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 34-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and after purification, divalent metal ion contaminants were removed by treatment with Chelex resin. ICP mass spectrometry was used to confirm the absence of significant divalent metal ion contamination in all materials. Steady State Kinetic Analyses—Steady state kinetic parameters of T5FEN were evaluated at 37 °C using HP5F substrate in 25 mm CHES or potassium glycinate, pH 9.3, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol as described (19Williams R. Sengerová B. Osborne S. Syson K. Ault S. Kilgour A. Chapados B.R. Tainer J.A. Sayers J.R. Grasby J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 34-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). MgCl2 was added to the desired concentration and the ionic strength (MgCl2 + KCl) adjusted to 80 mm using KCl. Substrate concentrations were varied around the Km, and reactions were sampled and quenched by addition of an equal volume of 25 mm EDTA at appropriate time intervals. Reactions were analyzed by dHPLC equipped with a fluorescence detector and initial rates (v) were calculated as described (19Williams R. Sengerová B. Osborne S. Syson K. Ault S. Kilgour A. Chapados B.R. Tainer J.A. Sayers J.R. Grasby J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 34-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Steady state catalytic parameters were determined at each Mg2+ concentration by curve fitting to the Michaelis-Menten equation. Plots of v/[E] versus [S], where [S] ≪ Km and 29[S] ≤ [Mg2+]/10 were also used to determine kcat/Km. Calcium Inhibition—Reaction mixtures containing 0.1 or 2 mm MgCl2, HP5F (3 or 1 μm, respectively), 25 mm potassium glycinate, pH 9.3, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, appropriate amounts of T5FEN (400-1500 pm), and varying CaCl2 with the appropriate amount of KCl to maintain the same ionic strength in all experiments, were used to determine the initial rate of reaction in the presence of Ca2+. For manganese-supported reactions, reaction mixtures contained 100 μm MnCl2, 100 nm HP5F, 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.5, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 200-1500 pm T5FEN, and CaCl2 with the appropriate amount of KCl. Reactions were analyzed as above to determine kobs (kobs = v/[E]) as a function of calcium ion concentration. Curve Fitting—All curve fitting was carried out by non-linear regression fitting using Kaleidagraph software (Synergy Software, Reading, PA) where appropriate weighted according to individual error values, using Equations 1-7 (see “Results”). Stimulation of FEN Catalysis by Magnesium Ions—To elucidate the role and minimal number of metal ions involved in the T5FEN-catalyzed reaction, kinetic parameters were monitored as a function of magnesium ion concentration. As the concentration of Mg2+ was varied, the ionic strength of reaction mixtures was kept constant by adjusting the amount of potassium chloride present. A fluorescent 29 nucleotide 5′-overhanging DNA hairpin substrate (HP5F) was employed. The characteristics of the T5FEN-catalyzed reaction of HP5F have been reported previously (19Williams R. Sengerová B. Osborne S. Syson K. Ault S. Kilgour A. Chapados B.R. Tainer J.A. Sayers J.R. Grasby J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 34-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 20Pickering T.J.

EMBO J. 2003; 22: 995-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As both maximal steady state and single turnover rates of Mg2+-supported reactions reach a pH-independent plateau above pH 8.5, pH 9.3 was selected as the pH optimum for the experiments. The variations of the individual kinetic parameters with magnesium ion concentration are shown in Fig. 2, a-c, and sample individual experiments are shown as supplemental Fig. S2. The turnover number (kcat) is magnesium ion-dependent and increases until a Mg2+-independent plateau is observed above 10 mm. Below 10 μm Mg2+, reactions no longer proceed to completion, and therefore data were not collected below this concentration. At low magnesium ion concentration (10-100 μm), kcat has a second order dependence on divalent metal ion concentration (Fig. 2a, green slope of 2 in log-log plot) that becomes first order (Fig. 2a, blue slope of 1) at cofactor concentrations greater than 100 μm. This change in reaction order cannot be accounted for by the participation of a single Mg2+ in the FEN-catalyzed reaction (see Equation 1). A reaction supported by a single ion would display first order dependence (Fig. 2a, slope of 1 in log-log plot) at all concentrations of magnesium ions ≤ KDMgES. Instead the minimal number of metal ions that could give rise to the behavior observed in Fig. 2a is 2. Moreover the change in reaction order requires that these two metal ions are bound independently and have differing affinities, but that for a reaction to proceed, both ions must be present. A model of this situation leads to Equation 2, where (kcat)obs is the observed turnover number at a given concentration of magnesium ions, KDMgES1 and KDMgES2 are the respective apparent magnesium ion dissociation constants from the ES complex, and kcat(max) is the maximal turnover rate at infinite magnesium ion concentration. At low concentrations of metal ions ([Mg] < KDMgES1 and KDMgES2), two metal ion binding sites of differing affinity need to be occupied to produce a catalytically active form of the enzyme giving rise to the slope of 2. At higher concentrations of magnesium ions ([Mg] < KDMgES2 but [Mg] > KDMgES1, so that (KDMgES1 + [Mg]) = [Mg]), the higher affinity site is saturated, and the reaction becomes first order as only the low affinity site is titrated and the occupancy of both sites is necessary for reaction to proceed. Curve fitting of the data to Equation 2 yields metal ion dissociation constants of KDMgES1 = 0.04 ± 0.003 mm and KDMgES2 = 2.25 ± 0.06 mm. (kcat)obs=(kcat)max[Mg2+]KDMgES+[Mg2+](Eq. 1) (kcat)obs=(kcat)max[Mg2+]2(KDMgES1+[Mg2+])(KDMgES2+[Mg2+])(Eq. 2) Product release is partially rate-limiting for T5FEN-catalyzed hydrolysis of HP5F (22Patel D.V. Tock M.R. Frary E. Feng M. Pickering T.J. Grasby J.A. Sayers J.R. J. Mol. Biol. 2002; 320: 1025-1035Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Thus, the rate constants under single turnover conditions (kST) were also monitored as a function of magnesium concentration, and are 2-3-fold greater than kcat in all cases (supplemental Fig. S3). The response to magnesium ion concentration is the same as for the kcat data and could be fitted to Equation 2 to give KDMgES1 and KDMgES2 values of 0.09 ± 0.01 mm and 2.8 ± 0.35 mm, respectively. These values are in good agreement with those obtained from the kcat data, and so the parameters obtained from Fig. 2a apply to the magnesium-dependent events prior to product release. HP5F binds to T5FEN weakly in the absence of divalent metal ions (KD > 15 μm). Substrate/product binding equilibria, as reflected by 1/Km, are magnesium ion-dependent and Km reaches a minimum (0.04 ± 0.01 μm) above 0.25 mm Mg2+ (Fig. 2b). In the Mg2+-dependent range, the slope of the log-log plot is 1.8 ± 0.2, suggesting a second order dependence. This magnesium-dependent behavior can only be explained by the involvement of at least two metal ions, but could potentially arise from two different models. In one model, two metal ions bind independently, and the presence of both is required to stabilize one or more enzyme-substrate state(s). However, to give rise to the slope close to 2 over the whole Mg2+-dependent range, both metal ions must bind with virtually identical binding constants. Applying this model to the data (Equation 3, where (1/Km)obs is the observed parameter at a given magnesium ion concentration, (1/Km)max is the maximal reciprocal of the concentration of substrate required to convert half the enzyme into the form(s) preceeding the rate-limiting step(s) at infinite magnesium ion concentration, and KDMgE1 and KDMgE2 are the respective apparent magnesium ion dissociation constants from free enzyme, with KDMgE1 and KDMgE2 kept identical) yields values of KDMgE1 (= KDMgE2) = 0.21 ± 0.02 mm (Fig. 2b). (1Km)obs=(1Km)max[Mg2+]2(KDMgE1+[Mg2+])(KDMgE2+[Mg2+])(Eq. 3) In an alternative model, the metal ions bind cooperatively to the enzyme. A curve fit to this scheme (Equation 4, n = 2, where KDMgE2 is the product of 2 apparent magnesium ion dissociation constants from free enzyme) yields KDMgE2=0.07±0.001 mM2. The difference between independent and cooperative behavior is only evident as the curves approach saturation, where an independent binding model produces a more gradual change to metal ion-independent behavior (see Fig. 2b). Distinguishing between these two models is generally difficult and especially so for this data set because Km measurements for nucleases derived from discontinuous assays are typically associated with errors of ±30%. (1Km)obs=(1Km)max[Mg2+]nKDMgEn+[Mg2+]n(Eq. 4) The magnesium ion dependence of the overall FEN reaction (kcat/Km) is shown in Fig. 2c. The apparent second order rate constant can be obtained in two ways, either from the individual catalytic parameters reported above, or as the gradient of a plot of v/[E] versus [S] at concentrations of [S] ≪ Km. Both of these approaches produce identical data within experimental error (Fig. 2c). In the latter case, the total concentration of phosphate diesters in HP5F was equal to or lower than 10% of the concentration of Mg2+, ruling out the possibility that Mg2+ binding to HP5F is affecting the cofactor dependence. The apparent second order rate constant increases with magnesium concentration, reaching a Mg2+-independent plateau above 2 mm. Importantly, the slope of the log-log plot at low Mg2+ concentrations is 2.9 ± 0.2, requiring the participation of at least three metal ions. As with the 1/Km data, either independent binding or cooperative models could explain the behavior. Furthermore, as this is at least a three-ion process, combinations of independent and cooperative models are plausible. All of these models fit the data reasonably. To maintain consistency with the data derived from the individual catalytic parameters, a combination of cooperative and independent binding models (Equation 5) with KDMgE2 = 0.07 mm2 produces a convincing data fit and a value for the dissociation constant of the third magnesium ion from the enzyme of 4.9 ± 1.4 mm (KDMgE3). If the independent binding model is used (Equation 6 with KDMgE1 = KDMgE2 = 0.21 mm), KDMgE3 = 6.1 ± 1.8 mm. (kcatKm)obs=(kcatKm)max[Mg2+]3(KDMgE2+[Mg2+]2)(KDMgE3+[Mg2+])(kcatKm)obs=(Eq. 5) (kcatKm)max[Mg2+]3(KDMgE1+[Mg2+])(KDMgE3+[Mg2+])(KDMgE3+[Mg2+])(Eq. 6) One caveat on the interpretation of this and any metal ion titration data is that the experiments only report on the presence and affinity of magnesium ions in the tested data range. If one or more metal ions are tightly bound over the entire range allowing data collection, then the total number of metal ions required to support the overall catalytic process is 4 or more. Inhibition of FEN Catalysis by Calcium Ions—When supplied as the sole cofactor, calcium ions do not support FEN catalysis. However, as is typical for other divalent metal ion-dependent nucleases, Ca2+ ions have been demonstrated to stabilize protein-DNA interactions in the absence of catalytically viable cofactors (12Feng M. Patel D. Dervan J.J. Ceska T. Suck D. Haq I. Sayers J.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 450-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To investigate the effect of added calcium ions on the Mg2+-supported FEN reaction, the rate of reaction was measured as a function of Ca2+ concentration at pH 9.3 in the presence of subsaturating Mg2+, but with saturating HP5F. The effects of addition of calcium ions on the Mn2+-supported FEN reaction were also investigated. For Mn2+-supported reactions, the pH was reduced to 7.5 to avoid the problems associated with the formation of manganese hydroxides at higher pH values. This pH value is still above the measured pKa for the Mn2+-supported FEN-catalyzed reaction of HP5F (21Tock M.R. Frary E. Sayers J.R. Grasby J.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 995-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). All reactions were inhibited by addition of Ca2+ (Fig. 3). To evaluate the apparent Ki at a given concentration of cofactor, data were fitted to a simple competitive inhibition model (Equation 7) where kobs is the normalized initial rate (v/[E]) at a given concentration of calcium ions, k0 is v/[E] in the absence of calcium ions, and Ki is equal to the concentration of calcium ions that produces 50% inhibition at the respective concentration of viable divalent metal ion cofactor. In all cases, the data fit acceptably to a simple competitive inhibition model up to 80% inhibition (kobs/k0 = 0.2) (Fig. 3a). At 2 mm Mg2+ Ki = 0.22 ± 0.02 mm whereas decreasing the concentration of Mg2+ to 0.1 mm decreased Ki = 0.037 ± 0.002 mm, indicating that Ca2+ inhibition is competitive with Mg2+. At 0.1 mm Mn2+ the Ki = 1.2 ± 0.1 mm. The 30-fold higher concentration of Ca2+ ions required to inhibit the Mn2+ reaction by a factor of 2 may in part be a consequence of the greater affinity of the FEN protein for Mn2+ versus Mg2+ (12Feng M. Patel D. Dervan J.J. Ceska T. Suck D. Haq I. Sayers J.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 450-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 21Tock M.R. Frary E. Sayers J.R. Grasby J.A. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 995-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, by necessity Mn2+ and Mg2+ experiments had to be carried out at different pH values, and pH-dependent effects cannot be ruled out. When Mn2+ was supplied as the cofactor for the EcoRVcatalyzed reaction of plasmid substrates, addition of calcium ions stimulated or first stimulated then inhibited reactions (23Vipond I.B. Baldwin G.S. Halford S.E. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 697-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This was explained by the formation of a mixed enzyme Mn2+Ca2+ species that was more reactive than an Mn2+Mn2+ form. However, a detailed study at low concentrations of Ca2+ revealed that no stimulation of activity was observed in the Mn2+-supported FEN reaction (Fig. 2b). kobsk0=KiKi+[Ca2+](Eq. 7) The observation that the overall FEN reaction requires the presence of at least three magnesium ions (Fig. 2c) suggests that a competitive inhibition scheme based on binding one Ca2+ ion (Equation 7) could be too simplistic as the calcium ions could replace more than one of the viable cofactor ions. Evidence that this is the case is observed at higher concentrations of inhibitory ions, where the Ca2+ dependence deviates from that predicted from a simple competitive inhibition model (Equation 7). In these regions, the slopes of log-log plots are -2.0 ± 0.1 (0.1 mm Mn2+) and -2.1 ± 0.2 (2 mm Mg2+) rather than the slope of -1 predicted by the simple competitive inhibition model (Fig. 3, b and c). Thus the simultaneous binding of two calcium ions inhibits the FEN reaction. However, a model where the presence of two calcium ions is the sole inhibitory form of the enzyme-substrate complex is also inadequate as this would give rise to a slope of -2 over the entire Ca2+-dependent data range. Assuming that Ca2+ ions inhibit the reaction by displacing catalytically competent cofactors, the FEN protein must possess at least two viable cofactor ions at specific sites, and replacement of either or both of these by Ca2+ significantly reduces activity. However, it is possible that one of the three FEN metal ions can be replaced by Ca2+ without altering the ability to catalyze the reaction. A similar biphasic response to inhibitory Ca2+ ions has been noted for the magnesium-supported reactions of the Tetrahymena ribozyme (24McConnell T.S. Herschlag D.M. Cech T.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8293-8303Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The data presented here demonstrate that the overall T5FEN-catalyzed reaction requires at least three magnesium ions. However, most FEN x-ray structures (in the absence of substrate) show only two divalent metal ions bound (Fig. 1b), consistent with ITC studies of divalent metal ion binding to T5FEN (12Feng M. Patel D. Dervan J.J. Ceska T. Suck D. Haq I. Sayers J.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 450-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). This implies that a third metal ion binds in the presence of substrate and has a lower association constant for the free enzyme. There are several structural precedents for the binding of additional active site metal ions by nucleases in the presence of substrate or products. A recent example is RNase HI where x-ray crystallography revealed the presence of a single magnesium ion in the absence of substrate (25Yang W. Hendrickson W.A. Crouch R.J. Satow Y. Science. 1990; 249: 1398-1405Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), but an inhibited enzyme-nucleic complex contained two active site magnesium ions (26Nowotny M. Gaidamakov S.A. Crouch R.J. Yang W. Cell. 2005; 121: 1005-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). However, debate has focused on the functional relevance of the metal ions within co-crystal structures and whether these additional metal ions are required for catalysis of phosphate diester hydrolysis. For the T5FEN reaction, the magnesium ion response of the maximal FEN reaction rate (kcat or kST) requires at least two independently bound magnesium ions. The calcium ion inhibition data also provide evidence for two inhibitory metal ion binding sites. This is most simply explained by a competitive inhibition scheme where replacement of either or both of the catalytically essential viable cofactors leads to inactivation. The finding that at least two viable cofactor ions are required to render the FEN protein catalytically competent makes it plausible that FEN derives its major rate acceleration using a two-metal-ion mechanism. This mechanism involves two metal ions interacting with the same oxygen atom of the scissile phosphate diester and requires they must have a separation of ≤4Å (Fig. 1a). The separation of the two metal ions (designated metal 1 and 2) observed in the T5FEN structure (8 Å) is much greater than this (Fig. 1b). However, in one hFEN structure two metal ions are liganded with a separation of 3.4 Å (Fig. 1b and supplemental Fig. S1) (15Sakurai S. Kitano K. Yamaguchi H. Hamada K. Okada K. Fukuda K. Uchida M. Ohtsuka E. Morioka H. Hakoshima T. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 683-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) to the same central carboxylate of the FEN active site, in an analogous fashion to the metal ion coordination observed in other nucleases (3Beese L.S. Steitz T.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 25-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar, 26Nowotny M. Gaidamakov S.A. Crouch R.J. Yang W. Cell. 2005; 121: 1005-1016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). The third T5FEN metal ion (metal 3), implicated by this study, could bind to Asp-130 in close proximity to metal 1 in an analogous fashion to the metal coordination observed in hFEN, and support a two-metal-ion mechanism for chemical catalysis. Mutation of Asp-130, or its equivalent in other FENs, leads to undetectable activity, supporting a key role for this Asp-130 site in metal ion coordination (12Feng M. Patel D. Dervan J.J. Ceska T. Suck D. Haq I. Sayers J.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 450-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 27Bhagwat M. Meara D. Nossal N.G. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3332-3338Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In contrast mutation of metal 2 coordinating carboxylates in T5FEN produces readily detectable activity (12Feng M. Patel D. Dervan J.J. Ceska T. Suck D. Haq I. Sayers J.R. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 450-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), suggestive metal 2 does not play a vital role in catalysis. Superposition of hFEN and T5FEN structures demonstrate that the third metal ion implicated by this study could be accommodated within the T5FEN active site bound to Asp-130 to support a two metal ion mechanism (Fig. 1b). However, the possibility remains that metal ions not involved in direct scissile bond interactions could contribute substantive rate acceleration by transition state stabilization (29Amyes T.L. Richard J.P. Tait J.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 15708-15709Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and the location of the third metal ion required by the T5FEN reaction merits further investigation. Metal ions involved in the overall FEN catalytic process could potentially play roles in substrate binding equilibria and/or chemical catalysis. Therefore, this study provides evidence that between one and three ions could participate in FEN substrate equilibria as the overall FEN reaction has a three metal ion requirement. The magnesium ion dependence of 1/Km can only be explained by the participation of at least two ions. For enzyme reactions rate limited by steps other than the chemical reaction under steady state conditions, Km values define the concentration of substrate required to convert half the enzyme into the form(s) proceeding the rate-limiting step(s) (30Gutfreund F. Kinetics for the Life Sciences. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1995Crossref Google Scholar). As product release is partially rate-limiting for the WT T5FEN-catalyzed reaction of HP5F (kST = 2.3 kcat), the stability of enzyme-product species is measured by Km. Furthermore, the stability of any intermediates formed after initial interaction of enzyme and substrate would also be reflected in this parameter. In the absence of direct interrogation of all of these enzyme-substrate and enzyme-product equilibria, any interpretation of the metal ion dependence of 1/Km is tentative, but the data suggest a role for metal ions in stabilizing T5FEN-substrate equilibria. Support for a requirement for metal ion(s) for productive substrate binding is provided by a recent bacteriophage T4FEN structure solved in complex with pseudo-Y DNA (8Devos J.M. Tomanicek S.J. Jones C.E. Nossal N.G. Mueser T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31713-31724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). This structure lacks divalent metal ions and has a mutation of metal 1-liganding central carboxylate (D132N). The DNA substrate makes no contacts with the FEN active site lacking metal ions, presumably due to the electrostatic repulsion by the carboxylates. Thus, bound metal ion(s) are probably required to stabilize a FEN-DNA complex where substrate is positioned for reaction to occur. An intriguing feature of the T4FEN DNA structure is that the scissile phosphate corresponding to the major site of FEN reaction, one nucleotide into the duplex region at the site of bifurcation, is located within duplex DNA bound parallel to the active site. Positioning metal 1 within the T4-DNA complex according to a T4FEN structure without substrate bound (9Mueser T.C. Nossal N.G. Hyde C.C. Cell. 1996; 85: 1101-1112Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) placed this ion 7 Å away from this scissile phosphate (8Devos J.M. Tomanicek S.J. Jones C.E. Nossal N.G. Mueser T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31713-31724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S4b). Metal 2 is at a much greater distance from the major reaction site (8Devos J.M. Tomanicek S.J. Jones C.E. Nossal N.G. Mueser T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 31713-31724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, a model of T5FEN-DNA interaction, based upon overlay with the T4-DNA structure, is in excellent agreement with experimental data on the interactions of the protein with the duplex and the 3′-overhang of the pseudo-Y (supplemental Fig. S4a) (19Williams R. Sengerová B. Osborne S. Syson K. Ault S. Kilgour A. Chapados B.R. Tainer J.A. Sayers J.R. Grasby J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 34-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 31Dervan J.J. Feng M.

This makes it difficult to envisage how the scissile phosphate, one nucleotide into the duplex region, can bind within the active site while still maintaining a Watson-Crick terminal base pair and the functional substrate-protein contacts. However, breaking the terminal base pair and making at least the first nucleotide and reaction site extrahelical would allow active site binding while maintaining substrate-protein contacts. The metal dependence of substrate equilibria observed here may be the consequence of a metal dependent conformational change, analogous to the nucleotide flipping seen in base excision repair enzymes (32Hitomi K. Iwai S. Tainer J.A. DNA Repair (Amst). 2007; 6: 410-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), which positions the scissile bond within the active site (supplemental Fig. S4c). The reactions of all FENs may have an overall three metal ion requirement. However, in archaeal and hFEN structures (10Hosfield D.J. Mol C.D. Shen B.H. Tainer J.A.

In bacteriophage and bacterial FEN structures, this region is disordered (7Kim Y. Eom S. Wang J. Lee D. Suh S. Steitz T.

Nature. 1996; 382: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Bacteriophage FENs lacking the N-terminal regions possess wild type activity (12Feng M. Patel D. Dervan J.J. Ceska T. Suck D.

Chem. 2005; 280: 12876-12887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), whereas the functional relevance of the N-terminal region of archaeal and mammalian FENs is untested. It is possible that the N terminus might substitute for metal ion 2 in these enzymes. While the role played by metal 2 deserves further investigation it could act in stabilization of FEN-substrate equilibria and/or may play a non-essential but rate accelerating role in chemical catalysis. It is intriguing to note that the same function may be provided by the protein in higher organism FENs. Other phosphoryl transferases have three metal ion active sites. For phosphate diesterases that contain three active site zinc ions, such as nuclease P1 (34Volbeda A. Lahm A. Sakiyama F. Suck D. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1607-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), phospholipase C (35Hough E. Hansen L.K. Birknes B. Jynge K. Hansen S. Hordvik A. Little C. Dodson E. Derewenda Z.

Biol. 2008; 15: 515-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), all three metals are suggested to act in chemical catalysis, but different mechanisms involving these three metal ions have been proposed. Several magnesium-dependent nucleases with three metal ion binding sites may also exist, such as the group I intron (39Shan S.O. Yoshida A. Sun S.G. Piccirilli J.A. Herschlag D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12299-12304Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), EcoRV (40Horton N.C. Perona J.J. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 6841-6857Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), and 3′-5′ exonuclease (41Han H. Rifkind J.M. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11104-11108Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Even the prototype two-metal-ion mechanism phosphoryl transferase, the phosphate monoesterase alkaline phosphatase, has an active site composed of two zinc ions plus one magnesium ion, and magnesium ions stimulate activity (2Kim E.E. Wyckoff H.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 218: 449-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (936) Google Scholar). Thus our new results on T5FEN in the context of existing data argue that three metal ion active sites may be a more common phenomena than previously suspected. Additional metal ions could influence biological efficacy by either moderating chemical reactivity or physical steps of the catalytic cycle such as substrate association, conformational changes, and enzyme-product stability. Thus, while a mechanism can be envisaged for rate accelerations of phosphate monoesterases and diesterases involving two metal ions, the biological function of other phosphoryl transferases in DNA replication, DNA repair, RNA processing, and RNA degradation may well involve a third ion or its functional equivalent.

Many biochemical or structural human immunodeficiency virus, type 1 (HIV-1) IN studies have been severely impeded by its propensity to aggregate. We characterized a retroviral IN (primate foamy virus (PFV-1)) that displays a solubility profile different from that of HIV-1 IN.

We performed specific enzymatic labeling of PFV-1 IN and measured the fluorescence resonance energy transfer between carboxytetramethylrhodamine-labeled IN and fluorescein-labeled DNA substrates. FRET and fluorescence anisotropy highlight the preferential binding of PFV-1 IN to the 3′-end processing site. Sequence-specific DNA binding was not observed with HIV-1 IN, suggesting that the intrinsic ability of retroviral INs to bind preferentially to the processing site is highly underestimated in the presence of aggregates. IN is in a dimeric state for 3′-processing on short DNA substrates, whereas IN polymerization, mediated by nonspecific contacts at internal DNA positions, occurs on longer DNAs. Additionally, aggregation, mediated by nonspecific IN-IN interactions, occurs preferentially with short DNAs at high IN/DNA ratios.

The integration process requires two catalytic steps. During the first step, titled 3′-processing (3′-P), IN specifically removes two nucleotides from each viral DNA end. IN then transfers both ends into target DNA by a one-step transesterification reaction, resulting in full-site integration. IN alone is competent for the insertion process (1Sinha S. Grandgenett D.P. J. Virol. 2005; 79: 8208-8216Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Retroviral INs consist of three functional domains. The core domain contains the DDE catalytic triad and is flanked by the N-terminal domain (involved in multimerization) and the C-terminal DNA-binding domain. The integrity of the DDE triad and a metallic cofactor are strictly required for enzymatic activity. Biochemical and structural studies of HIV-1 IN have been severely impeded because of solubility. No structural data are available for the full-length protein (free or bound to DNA) to date, although x-ray structures of DNA-free single or double domains have been successfully solved (2Chen J.C. Krucinski J. Miercke L.J. Finer-Moore J.S. Tang A.H. Leavitt A.D. Stroud R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8233-8238Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 3Wang J.Y. Ling H.

Hence, the sequence specificity of the 3′-P reaction remains poorly understood and little is known about the mechanism of IN/DNA substrate recognition. Point mutations or the use of detergent may improve the solubility but only to a limited extent (6Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Ghirlando R. Craigie R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7712-7718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 7Deprez E. Tauc P. Leh H. Mouscadet J.F. Auclair C. Brochon J.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9275-9284Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar) and may also cause changes to IN properties. For instance, detergent is detrimental to 3′-P activity in the presence of the physiological cofactor Mg2+ (8Leh H. Brodin P. Bischerour J. Deprez E. Tauc P. Brochon J.C. LeCam E. Coulaud D. Auclair C. Mouscadet J.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9285-9294Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and one soluble mutant was found to be resistant to diketo-acid compounds (9Marchand C. Johnson A.A. Karki R.G. Pais G.C. Zhang X. Cowansage K. Patel T.A. Nicklaus M.C. Burke Jr., T.R. Pommier Y. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 600-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Endonucleolytic cleavage depends primarily on the presence of the canonical CA sequence preceding the removed dinucleotide. Other positions are crucial for 3′-P activity under Mg2+ conditions, despite the absence, in vitro, of IN preference/specificity for the cognate U5 or U3 terminal sequence at the DNA binding level (10Agapkina J. Smolov M. Barbe S. Zubin E. Zatsepin T. Deprez E. Le Bret M. Mouscadet J.F. Gottikh M. J. Biol.

Thus, it is generally hypothesized that IN specificity is fully explained at the catalytic level. However, due to poor solubility, it is a difficult task to determine which enzymatic properties of HIV-1 IN actually correspond to intrinsic properties of retroviral INs and which properties are related to aggregation. During the course of our study on HIV-1 IN, we have observed significant differences relating to solubility between HIV-1 IN and another retroviral IN, primate foamy virus-1 (PFV-1) IN. PFV-1 is the prototype of foamy viruses belonging to the retrovirus family and differ from lentiviruses in some aspects. For instance, PFV-1 reverse transcription occurs at late stages of the replication cycle (13Moebes A. Enssle J. Bieniasz P.D. Heinkelein M. Lindemann D. Bock M. McClure M.O. Rethwilm A. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 7305-7311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 14Yu S.F. Sullivan M.D. Linial M.L. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 1565-1572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interaction with host cellular cofactors is also distinct, since LEDGF/p75 only interacts with lentiviral INs (15Cherepanov P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: 113-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Furthermore, only the U5 end is processed due to the asymmetric nature of the integration process in the case of PFV-1 (16Enssle J. Moebes A. Heinkelein M. Panhuysen M. Mauer B. Schweizer M. Neumann-Haefelin D. Rethwilm A. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 1445-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). However, integration is an obligatory step for replicating PFV-1, a hallmark of retrovirus life cycle (16Enssle J. Moebes A. Heinkelein M. Panhuysen M. Mauer B. Schweizer M. Neumann-Haefelin D. Rethwilm A. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 1445-1452Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). PFV-1 IN shares common structural features with other retroviral INs, such as three-domain organization as well as the three major catalytic activities, 3′-P, strand transfer, and disintegration (17Pahl A. Flugel R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2957-2966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 19Oh Y.T. Shin C.G. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1999; 47: 621-629PubMed Google Scholar). To get deeper insight into the IN/DNA recognition mechanism, we studied and compared solubility, oligomeric status and catalytic efficiency of PFV-1 and HIV-1 IN. We used various methods, such as time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy (TFA), fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), and size exclusion chromatography, and found that free PFV-1 IN was significantly more soluble than HIV-1 IN. This enabled us to successfully apply transglutaminase (TGase)-mediated TAMRA labeling to a soluble IN at a single predefined position. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments and a DNA-binding anisotropy-based assay were conducted to assess the specificity of IN-DNA interactions. A specific mode of interaction was clearly shown for PFV-1 IN but not for HIV-1 IN. DNA promotes the catalytically competent dimeric state. The dimerization process is in competition with other processes (which were found to be detrimental to activity), such as IN polymerization and aggregation, mediated by nonspecific IN-DNA and IN-IN interactions, respectively. A selection of specific/competent complexes may be achieved using short DNA substrates under conditions of high ionic strength. Purification and IN Labeling by Guinea Pig TGase—For DNA-binding and 3′-P assays, unlabeled wild-type HIV-1 and PFV-1 IN were purified as previously described (8Leh H. Brodin P. Bischerour J. Deprez E. Tauc P. Brochon J.C. LeCam E. Coulaud D. Auclair C. Mouscadet J.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9285-9294Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The plasmid encoding PFV-1 IN with the specific C-terminal PKPQQFM tag for TGase-mediated labeling was constructed by PCR amplification of pET15b-PFV-IN (20Delelis O. Petit C. Leh H. Mbemba G. Mouscadet J.F. Sonigo P. Retrovirology. 2005; 2: 31-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) with P1 and P2 primers (P1, 5′-ACA TAT GTG TAA TAC CAA AAA ACC AAA CCT GG-3′; P2, 5′-AGG ATC CTA CAT AAA CTG CTG AGG TTT TGG CTC GAG TTC ATT TTT TTC-3′). The corresponding plasmid for tagged HIV-1 IN was constructed by amplification of pET15b-HIV-IN (8Leh H. Brodin P. Bischerour J. Deprez E. Tauc P. Brochon J.C. LeCam E. Coulaud D. Auclair C. Mouscadet J.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9285-9294Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) with P3 and P4 primers (P3, 5′-CCA TAT GTT TTT AGA TGG AAT AGA TAA-3′; P4, 5′-CGG ATC CTA CAT AAA CTG CTG AGG TTT TGG GTC CTC ATC CTG TCT ACT-3′). The underlined nucleotides correspond to the TGase tag (PKPQQFM) located at the C terminus of IN. The resulting DNAs encoding IN-PKPQQFM were inserted into pET15b. For labeling, IN attached to Ni2+-beads was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 0.5 mm TAMRA cadaverine (Molecular Probes) and 1 unit of guinea pig TGase (Sigma) in the labeling buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 10 mm CaCl2). Beads were extensively washed with Tris buffer (50 mm, pH 8, 1 m NaCl) to remove free fluorophores. Elution was done with 1 m imidazole. TAMRA-labeled or unlabeled PFV-1 IN was further purified by cation exchange chromatography on a Mono S column (Bio-Rad) previously equilibrated with 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1 m NaCl. IN was diluted before loading (1 ml/min) and a linear salt gradient (0.1-1 m NaCl) was applied at 1 ml/min. IN was eluted at 450-550 mm NaCl (cation exchange chromatography was unsuccessful with HIV-1 IN for solubility reasons). It was possible to further concentrate PFV-1 IN using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filters (Millipore). Concentrations up to 250 μm in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 75 mm NaCl were obtained. Ionic strength was adjusted by buffer exchange during the concentration step. Dialysis was not used, since protein aggregation was reproducibly observed during the dialysis step of concentrated samples (significant precipitation occurred at PFV-1 IN concentrations of 12 mg/ml, whichever protocol was used). Size Exclusion Chromatography—100 μl of varying concentrations of purified PFV-1 IN (from 2 to 60 μm) were applied at room temperature onto a Superdex 200 preparation grade column (Hiload 16/60; Amersham Biosciences), using an AKTA FPLC system (Amersham Biosciences) previously equilibrated with the protein buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.05 or 0.5 m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 50 μm ZnSO4, and 4 mm β-mercaptoethanol). The column was calibrated with the following globular proteins: sweet potato β-amylase (200 kDa), yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), ovalbumin (45 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and horse heart cytochrome c (12.5 kDa) (MW-GF-200 kit; Sigma). Fractions were collected at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min, under a pressure of 0.5 megapascals. Absorbance was measured at 280 nm. The exclusion volume of the column V0 was measured by calibration with blue dextran (2000 kDa). Characterization of TAMRA-labeled IN (INT)—We evaluated the number of TAMRAs per labeled protein by mass spectrometry analysis; INT and the unlabeled tagged IN were subjected to SDS-PAGE. After gel staining, the gel slides containing the corresponding proteins were destained in 25 mm NH4CO3, 50% acetonitrile. A proteolysis using sequence grade trypsin (Promega) was then performed overnight at 37 °C. The resulting peptides were recovered by the addition of 50% acetonitrile, 5% trifluoroacetic acid and dried in a SpeedVac. They were reconstituted in 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and applied on a SEND-ID protein array according to Ciphergen's protocol. The mass spectra were obtained by reading the protein chip using a SELDI mass spectrometer. The resulting spectra were compared with the in silico profile obtained with GPMAW software (Lighthouse Data). The labeling yield of purified INT was estimated by both absorbance spectroscopy and FCS. Given the molar extinction coefficient of TAMRA-cadaverine at 556 nm (62,000 m-1·cm-1) and the results from the Bradford protein assay, the labeling yield was estimated to be 45% by absorbance spectroscopy. The FCS autocorrelation curve (Fig. 1E) was also used to estimate the labeling yield, since it is possible to deduce from the inverse autocorrelation amplitude the mean number of labeled molecules in the detection volume. Here, g(0)-1 was equal to 0.025 and the detection volume was 1.27 μm3 (the lateral ω0 and axial z0 dimensions are equal to 0.45 and 1.5 μm, respectively) giving an estimated concentration of INT (52 nm). Considering the concentration of total IN (100 nm), the deduced labeling yield (∼50%) is in good agreement with that determined by absorbance spectroscopy. This calculation is evidently correct only if a single fluorophore is attached to the protein (SELDI analysis of INT confirmed that a single TAMRA moiety was covalently and specifically attached to the protein C-terminal end). INT, as obtained after the labeling procedure, was also tested for 3′-P at the U5 end (21-mer oligonucleotide) using a standard assay (8Leh H. Brodin P. Bischerour J. Deprez E. Tauc P. Brochon J.C. LeCam E. Coulaud D. Auclair C. Mouscadet J.F. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9285-9294Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and was compared with both the untagged and the unlabeled tagged proteins. 3′-P and half-transfer products were about 23-27% and 3.5-4.5%, respectively, for a 3-h incubation (data not shown), and no significant difference was observed between the three samples, showing that neither the PKPQQFM tag nor the attached fluorophore influences the catalytic activity. PFV-1 ODNs for DNA Binding/3′-P Anisotropy-based Assays and FRET Experiments—All ODNs (≤65-mer) were purchased from Eurogentec (Liège, Belgium) and further purified by gel electrophoresis. ODNs of various lengths (15-65-mer) were tested for 3′-P activity, all mimicking the specific (cognate) terminal U5 sequence: PFV-CAAT (sequence of the 65-mer, 5′-GAA CTA CAC TTA TCT TAA ATG ATG TAA CTC CTT AGG ATA ATC AAT ATA CAA AAT TCC ATG ACA AT-3′. The 3′-dinucleotide cleaved by IN is underlined). The processed strand and its complementary nonprocessed strand were denoted A and B, respectively. Fluorescein (Fl) was attached at the 5′- or 3′-end of strand A for DNA-binding experiments. Fl was attached at the 3′-end of strand A for the activity assay. The PFV-GTAT sequence was identical, except that the four 3′-term bases of strand A were GTAT instead of the canonical sequence CAAT. The specific HIV-1 ODN (U5 sequence) is provided in Ref. 21Guiot E. Carayon K. Delelis O. Simon F. Tauc P. Zubin E. Gottikh M. Mouscadet J.F. Brochon J.C. Deprez E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22707-22719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar. The three nonspecific (random) sequences used for competition experiments (Fig. 4) were as follows: 5′-ACA TAA TCT AAA ATA ATT GCC-3′ (21mer), 5′-ACC TAT GCG CCG CTA GAT TCC-3′ (21-mer), and 5′-TCA AGC TAG AAG ATT ATC TCA AGT ACA TAA TCT AAA ATA ATT GCC-3′ (45-mer). Annealing of oligonucleotides was obtained by mixing equimolar amounts of complementary strands in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, heating to 85 °C for 5 min, and slow cooling to 25 °C. For FRET experiments, ODNs of various lengths (21-300-mer) were studied, all mimicking the PFV-1 U5 end. The double-stranded ODN was Fl-labeled at the 5′-end (A or B strand) (Fig. 3A). Fl-labeled 100- and 300-mer double-stranded ODNs were obtained by PCR. All PCRs were performed using the pHSRV13 plasmid encoding the proviral PFV-1 genome. The 100-mer BFl5 and 300-mer BFl5 were obtained using, as primers, the single-stranded 21-mer BFl5 ODN and a second ODN hybridizing to an internal sequence located, respectively, 100 or 300 bp from the U5 extremity. The 100-mer AFl5 and 300-mer AFl5 were obtained using, as primers, the nonfluorescent single-stranded 21-mer B ODN and a 5′-Fl-labeled ODN hybridizing to an internal sequence located, respectively, 100 or 300 bp from the U5 extremity. After amplification, PCR products were purified on agarose gel using the Qiagen gel extraction kit. Steady-state Fluorescence Anisotropy-based Assay—Anisotropy-based assay is a quantitative method to determine both DNA binding and catalytic parameters of IN using the same sample (21Guiot E. Carayon K. Delelis O. Simon F. Tauc P. Zubin E. Gottikh M. Mouscadet J.F. Brochon J.C. Deprez E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22707-22719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Briefly, IN binding to Fl-labeled DNA increases the steady-state anisotropy value (r) (measured on a Beacon instrument (Panvera, Madison, WI)), allowing the calculation of the fraction of DNA sites bound to IN. The DNA-binding step can be recorded at 25 °C using Fl-labeled ODNs at the 5′- or 3′-end of either the A or B strand. By shifting the temperature to 37 °C, the activity-dependent decrease in the r value allows quantification of the 3′-P reaction. This occurs only if Fl is initially linked to the AT dinucleotide (the released PFV-1 dinucleotide). The fraction of released dinucleotides (Fdinu) can be calculated using the relative decrease of r compared with the initial value obtained at the end of the DNA-binding step (rt = 0) (real time assay) (21Guiot E. Carayon K. Delelis O. Simon F. Tauc P. Zubin E. Gottikh M. Mouscadet J.F. Brochon J.C. Deprez E. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22707-22719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). No decrease in the r value was observed with the PFV-GTAT control sequence, in contrast to the PFV-CAAT canonical sequence (data not shown). The activity can be also calculated in fixed time experiments (3′-P is stopped by SDS), Fdinu = (rNP - r)/(rNP - rdinu), where rNP and rdinu are the anisotropies for pure solutions of nonprocessed double-stranded ODN and dinucleotide, respectively (rdinu was measured using the 5′-AT-3′-Fl dinucleotide). The formation of IN·DNA complexes and the subsequent 3′-P catalytic reaction were performed by incubating Fl-labeled ODNs with unlabeled IN in buffer A (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm MgCl2). IN, DNA, and NaCl concentrations are explicitly mentioned in the figure legends. FRET Experiments—FRET between Fl-labeled DNA (donor) and TAMRA-labeled IN (acceptor) was monitored with an Eclipse (Varian) spectrofluorimeter. DNA concentration was constant (20 nm) in buffer A + 50 mm NaCl. INT was progressively added, and the decrease in the steady-state emission intensity of the donor was recorded at 25 °C. The excitation wavelength was 500 nm. The donor quenching (qD) was measured at 520 nm. qD was estimated using the equation, qD = 1 - (ID,[INT]/ID,0), where ID,0 and ID,[INT] represent the donor emission intensity at 520 nm in the absence (DNA alone) and in presence of acceptor (along the titration), respectively. Excitation and emission slit widths were 10 and 5 nm, respectively. For each DNA/INT mixture, a corresponding control experiment was done using unlabeled IN to check the signal stability. Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy—FCS measurements were performed under two-photon excitation (840 nm) on a home-built system using an 80-MHz mode-locked Tsunami Ti:Sapphire laser (pulse 100 fs) pumped by a Millenia solid state laser (Spectra Physics) and a Nikon TE2000 inverted microscope. Before entering through the epifluorescence port of the microscope, the laser beam was expanded with a two-lens afocal system to fill the back aperture of the objective (Nikon, Plan Apo, ×100, numerical aperture 1.4, oil immersion). The setup was optimized to obtain a diffraction-limited focal spot. Measurements were typically carried out in a 50-μl solution dropped on the coverslip (buffer A + 50 mm NaCl). Fluorescence was collected by the same objective, separated from the excitation by a dichroic mirror (Chroma 700DCSPXR) and focused onto an avalanche photodiode (SPCM-AQR-14; PerkinElmer Life Sciences). An additional filter was used to reject the residual excitation light (Chroma 2P-Emitter E700SP). The detector was connected to a digital correlator (ALV 6000) that calculates the normalized correlation function g(τ) of fluorescence fluctuations according to Equation 1, where I(t) is the number of detected fluorescence photons per time unit. Assuming a three-dimensional Gaussian distribution of the excitation intensity, the FCS function for a free Brownian diffusion process is given by Equation 2, where N is the mean number of fluorophores in the excitation volume, and τD is the translational diffusion time. ω0 and z0 are the lateral and axial dimensions of the excitation volume, respectively. The mean translational diffusion time was determined by fitting autocorrelation curves using a Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear least-squares fitting algorithm according to the analytical model (Equation 2). For two-photon excitation, the diffusion coefficient D is then calculated according to the equation, D = ω2/8τD. The calibration of the excitation volume was performed using a 10 nm water solution of TAMRA (D = 2.8 × 10-10 m2 s-1). The lateral ω0 and axial z0 dimensions of the excitation volume were 0.45 and 1.5 μm, respectively. The excitation power was adjusted using a neutral density filter. For our setup, we determined that an excitation power of 10 milliwatts was suitable for two-photon excitation of both TAMRA alone and INT (fluorescence intensity exhibits a quadratic dependence, and τD value is constant (absence of photobleaching) as a function of the incident power below 16 milliwatts). Recording times were typically 5 min (average of 10 cycles of 30 s). Time-resolved Fluorescence Anisotropy—Fluorescence of Trp or Fl was used for hydrodynamic studies of free or DNA-bound PFV-1 IN, respectively (in buffer A + 50 mm NaCl). IN·DNA complexes were obtained using unlabeled PFV-1 IN and Fl-labeled 15- and 21-mer U5 PFV-1 ODN (Fl at the 5′-end of strand A). Correlation times (θ) were calculated from the two polarized fluorescence decays I⊥(t) and I∥(t), using time-correlated single photon counting (21Guiot E. Carayon K. Delelis O. Simon F. Tauc P.

Briefly, the time scaling was 19.5 ps/channel, and 4096 channels were used. The excitation light pulse source was a Ti:Sapphire laser (Millennia-pumped Tsunami femtosecond laser; Spectra Physics) (repetition rate, 8 MHz) associated with a second or third harmonic generator tuned to 490 or 296 nm for Fl or Trp, respectively. The emission monochromator (ARC SpectraPro-150) was set to 530 or 340 nm (Δλ = 15 nm) for Fl or Trp, respectively. The two polarized components were collected alternately over a period of 30 s (total count of I∥(t) was 15 millions, which is a condition compatible with the recovery of correlation times up to ∼80 ns using Trp fluorescence (7Deprez E. Tauc P. Leh H. Mouscadet J.F. Auclair C. Brochon J.C. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 9275-9284Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar)). I⊥(t) and I∥(t) were analyzed by the maximum entropy method (23Brochon J.C. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 240: 262-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 24Livesey A.K. Brochon J.C. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 693-706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar) to determine the distributions of both lifetimes (τ) and rotational correlation times (θ), according to Equations 3 and 4. where αi represents the relative population characterized by the lifetime τi, and ρj represents the initial anisotropy related to a motion characterized by the rotational correlation time θj. r0′ is the apparent fundamental anisotropy value (typically 0.24-0.26 in the present study, which is below the fundamental anisotropy value, 0.3, for Trp at λex = 296 nm, suggesting that a fast component in the PFV-1 IN anisotropy decay cannot be resolved by the instrument as previously found for many proteins (25Lakowics J. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 3rd Ed. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2006Crossref Scopus (17137) Google Scholar)). The decay of the total fluorescence intensity, IT(t), and the fluorescence anisotropy decay, r(t), are then calculated from both polarized components according to Equations 7 and 8, respectively, where G represents the correction factor for the difference in the monochromator transmission between parallel and perpendicular polarized components. TFA and FCS Reveal Distinct Solubility Properties between HIV-1 and PFV-1 INs—TFA and FCS are complementary methods used to study the hydrodynamic properties of proteins, measuring the rotational and translational diffusion of molecules, respectively (25Lakowics J. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 3rd Ed. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2006Crossref Scopus (17137) Google Scholar). Overall rotational diffusion or flexibility are major causes of light depolarization, and anisotropy decay analysis allows the determination of rotational correlation time (θ) distribution. Long correlation time (θlong) represents the overall tumbling motion related to the protein hydrodynamic volume. In FCS, the temporal behavior of fluorescence fluctuations within a small excitation volume, described by the autocorrelation function, allo"

However, the mechanism of tyrosine nitration and the nature of the proteins that become tyrosine nitrated during inflammation remain unclear. Here we show that eosinophils but not other cell types including neutrophils contain nitrotyrosine-positive proteins in specific granules. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the human eosinophil toxins, eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), major basic protein, eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), and the respective murine toxins, are post-translationally modified by nitration at tyrosine residues during cell maturation. High resolution affinity-mass spectrometry identified specific single nitration sites at Tyr349 in EPO and Tyr33 in both ECP and EDN. ECP and EDN crystal structures revealed and EPO structure modeling suggested that the nitrated tyrosine residues in the toxins are surface exposed. Studies in EPO-/-, gp91phox-/-, and NOS-/- mice revealed that tyrosine nitration of these toxins is mediated by EPO in the presence of hydrogen peroxide and minute amounts of NOx. Tyrosine nitration of eosinophil granule toxins occurs during maturation of eosinophils, independent of inflammation. These results provide evidence that post-translational tyrosine nitration is unique to eosinophils.

In response to allergen provocation or parasitic infection, expanded eosinophil populations from the bone marrow are selectively recruited to affected tissues (1Giembycz M.A. Lindsay M.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 213-340PubMed Google Scholar). The release of cationic toxins from activated eosinophils by degranulation is regarded as a dominant effector function of these cells, mediating lysis of helminths and protozoae (7Butterworth A.E.

The positive net charge conveys tight toxin binding to negatively charged cell surfaces where EPO causes oxidation of membrane components in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) (8Nogueira N.M. Klebanoff S.J. Cohn Z.A. J. Immunol. 1982; 128: 1705-1708PubMed Google Scholar). MBP increases membrane permeability and perturbation following insertion of apolar residues into the membrane (11Wasmoen T.L. Bell M.P. Loegering D.A. Gleich G.J. Prendergast F.G. McKean D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12559-12563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas ECP creates membrane channels (12Young J.D. Peterson C.G. Venge P. Cohn Z.A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 30234Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Due to their unspecific binding to membranes and their cytolytic activities, eosinophil granule proteins also cause host tissue damage during parasite infections and inflammatory disorders such as allergic asthma (14Molina H.A. Kierszenbaum F. Immunology. 1989; 66: 289-295PubMed Google Scholar, 15Motojima S. Frigas E. Loegering D.A. Gleich G.J. Am. Rev. Respir.

Despite advances in elucidating the mechanisms of action for the eosinophil granule proteins (1Giembycz M.A. Lindsay M.A. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 213-340PubMed Google Scholar, 2Gleich G.J. Adolphson C.R. Leiferman K.M. Annu. Rev. Med. 1993; 44: 85-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), the cationic nature of these proteins (pI values > 10) would predict electrostatic repulsion and exclude interaction/cooperation of single granule proteins and among different granule proteins. Because sequence data for human EPO, MBP, EDN, and ECP reveal the presence of 4 to 16 tyrosine residues, and EPO can generate 3-nitrotyrosine (3NT) via oxidation of nitrite ( NO2-) (17Wu W. Chen Y. Hazen S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25933-25944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that selective post-translational 3NT formation in eosinophil granule proteins is likely necessary to overcome such logistical issues. Here we show that all of the eosinophil granule proteins from both men and mouse are nitrated. We further identified specific single nitration sites, using high resolution affinity-mass spectrometry, in several of the human eosinophil granule proteins: Tyr349 in EPO and Tyr33 in both human ECP and EDN. Moreover, we demonstrated that Tyr nitration of the eosinophil granule proteins is exclusively mediated by EPO, in the presence of functional NADPH oxidase and minute amounts of NOx. EPO appears to nitrate itself via an autocatalytic mechanism. Human Lung Tissue and Blood Samples—Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung tissue (Centre Hospitalier Lyon Sud, Pierre-Bénite, France) and healthy lung tissue (Klinik Schillerhöhe, Gerlingen, Germany) were cut in 1 × 1 × 1-cm blocks and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissue blocks were cut into 5-6-μm sections and put on poly-l-lysine-coated glass slides for immunofluorescence. Blood samples were obtained from patients with helminth infections (Paul-Lechler-Krankenhaus, Tübingen, Germany), from healthy individuals (Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hygiene, Universitätsklinikum Tübingen, Germany), from patients with atopic rhinitis or asthma bronchiale (Swiss Institute of Allergy and Asthma Research (SIAF), Davos, Switzerland and Universitätshautklinik Tübingen, Germany), and from patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) (Children's Hospital Universitätsklinikum Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany; Nachsorgeklinik Tannheim, Tannheim, Germany; University Clinics, Zürich, Switzerland). Cord blood was obtained from the Universitäts-Frauenklinik, Tübingen, Germany.

Mice were housed in isolator cages that provided a pathogen-free environment. The mice were repeatedly investigated for microbial infections by bacterial culturing and serology and remained negative up to date. The hygienic status was repeatedly tested by a panel of common murine pathogens according to the FELASA recommendations of 2002. Additionally, eosinophils and, in turn, granules were purified (>98%) from IL-5 transgenic mice and IL-5/gp91phox-/- mice for granule protein preparations. Spleens were removed from transgenic animals (18Lee N.A. McGarry M.P. Larson K.A. Horton M.A. Kristensen A.B. Lee J.J. J.

The free DNA was degraded with 4,000 units of DNase at 37 °C for 20 min. Granule pellets were obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Eosinophil granules were re-suspended in 1 ml in 0.01 m HCl, pH 3, and disrupted by sonication (Sonifier, Branson, Schwäbisch Gmünd, Germany). The suspension was centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 10 min. The protein concentration in the supernantant was determined using the Pierce assay (Perbio Science GmbH, Bonn, Germany). Human granulocytes were isolated as described above and eosinophils were isolated by negative selection using CD 16 magnetic beads and the MACS system (Miltenyi Biotec GMBH, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Localization of 3NT-positive Proteins in Human and Animal Tissues and Leukocyte Preparations by Indirect Immunofluorescence—The following antibodies were used: a polyclonal rabbit antibody or a monoclonal mouse IgG antibody against 3NT (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) and a Cy2-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG antibody as second antibody. Different cell types were detected using Cy3-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Dako, Hamburg, Germany) as second antibody and cell-specific monoclonal antibodies: human eosinophils (MBP, clone BMK-13; Monosan, Uden, The Nether-lands), T lymphocytes (anti-CD3, anti-CD45RO; Dako, Hamburg, Germany), neutrophils (neutrophil elastase; Dako), mast cells (C-kit 104D201), and monocytes (anti-CD14; Dako). Stained thin sections were examined using a Zeiss Axioplan microscope (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany); for controls, cells were stained without the respective first antibodies. Thirty thin sections of lung tissue from six CF patients and from three healthy individuals at a magnification of ×100 were investigated. Blood smears from patients with atopic rhinitis, helminthic infection, and healthy individuals were stained with antibodies specific for MBP and 3NT, and with DAPI. Granulocytes and lymphocytes from human heparin blood were isolated by using Ficoll T 500 (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany). Cytospin samples were prepared and the cells were fixed on slides with methanol/acetone (50/50%) and stained with antibodies specific for MBP and 3NT, and with DAPI. For assessing the percentage of 3NT and MBP double stained cells to MBP single stained cells, five pictures (210 μm × 140 μm) of each slide were taken using the Zeiss Axio vision program. To demonstrate localization of 3NT-positive proteins in human eosinophil granules, on-section immunolabeling (21Schwarz H. Humbel B.M. Meth. Mol. Biol. 2007; 369: 229-256Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used. Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol at progressive lower temperature from 0 °C down to-40 °C, infiltrated with Lowicryl K11M and UV-polymerized at -40 °C. Thereafter, ultrathin sections were stained for immunofluorescence with a rabbit antibody against 3NT and a mouse antibody against MBP, detected by corresponding fluorochrome-labeled secondary goat antibodies (Jackson). Nuclei were counter-stained with DAPI and the samples visualized in a Zeiss Axiophot using ×63 (or ×100) oil immersion objectives. In addition, for transmission electron microscopy ultrathin sections were labeled with a rabbit antibody against 3NT and protein A-10-nm gold complexes (gift from Dr. York-Dieter Stierhof, ZMBP Tübingen). These sections were finally stained with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate and lead citrate and analyzed in a Philips CM10 electron microscope at 60 kV using a 30-μm objective aperture. Finally, for determination of granule sizes, eosinophils from IL-5 transgenic and IL-5 transgenic EPO-/- mice were isolated. For ultrastructural studies cells were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline and embedded in 2% agarose to cut small blocks of about 1 mm3 in size. After post-fixation with 1% osmium tetroxide in 100 mm PO4 buffer, pH 7.2, for 1 h on ice, these blocks were rinsed with aqua bidest, treated with 1% aqueous uranyl acetate for 1 h at 4°C, dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol at ambient temperature, infiltrated with Epon, and polymerized at 60 °C. Digital pictures were taken from 5 ultrathin sections of each sample and the granula diameter of 100 cells of each sample was measured using the Zeiss AxioVision Programm 4.6.3 (Zeiss). Cord blood cells from three donors were collected in heparin and layered over Histopaque 1077 (Sigma). Mononuclear fractions were harvested after centrifugation at 250 × g for 30 min. The cells were washed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated at 1 × 106 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal calf serum with or without IL-5 (5 ng/ml) for 1 to 14 days. Every 6 days half of the medium was replaced with fresh medium. Cytospins of cell suspensions were prepared by centrifugation at 250 × g for 5 min onto a clean glass slide. The slides were air dried and stained with a monoclonal 3NT antibody and DAPI. Additionally, eosinophils from wild type IL-5 transgenic and IL-5 transgenic EPO-/- mice were double stained with 3NT antibodies and DAPI. Eosinophils from CGD patients were double stained with antibodies against 3NT, human MBP, and DAPI. De novo nitration of non-nitrated granula proteins from IL-5/gp91phox-/- mice was tested by incubation of the proteins with 100 μm KNO2 (Sigma) and 100 μm H2O2 (Sigma) in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, for 5, 15, 30, and 60 s. Aliquots were spotted onto nitrocellulose membranes and 3NT-positive proteins were detected with a monoclonal antibody against 3NT. Furthermore, blood smears from mice lacking nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms, specifically inducible (iNOS or type II) KO mice, neuronal (nNOS or type I), and endothelial (eNOS or type III) double KO mice and iNOS/eNOS/nNOS triple KO mice (22Morishita T. Tsutsui M. Shimokawa H. Sabanai K. Tasaki H. Suda O. Nakata S. Tanimoto A. Wang K.Y. Ueta Y. Sasaguri Y. Nakashima Y. Yanagihara N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 10616-10621Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) were stained with antibodies specific for MBP, 3NT, and DAPI. Identification of 3NT-positive Proteins by Immunoblotting and Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS) in Different Cell Types—Crude protein solutions from immunobead purified eosinophils (102 cells) (23Hansel T.T. De Vries I. Iff T. Rihs S. Wandzilak M. Betz S. Blaser K. Walker C. J. Immunol. Meth. 1991; 145: 105-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (566) Google Scholar), Ficoll-purified neutrophils (107 cells), monocytes/lymphocytes (107 cells) (24Metcalf J.A. Gallin J.I. Nauseef W.M. Root R.K. Laboratory Manual of Neutrophil Function. Raven Press, New York1986: 1-200Google Scholar), and 10 μg of purified MPO (25Goldstein W. Doring G. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1986; 134: 49-56PubMed Google Scholar) were subjected to SDS-PAGE (200 V/75 mA). Samples were blotted on nitrocellulose (0.8 mA/cm2, 15 V) and skim milk-blocked blots were incubated with mouse anti-3NT IgG or mouse anti-EPO IgG (Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ). Bound antibodies were detected using appropriate peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Dako) using the chemiluminescent reagent Lumigen PS-3 (Amersham Biosciences) and the ECL Detection System (Amersham Biosciences). Detection of bound antibodies was achieved using x-ray film (Hyperfilm ECL, Amersham Biosciences) in the presence of molecular weight markers (Amersham Biosciences). The specificity of the primary 3NT-antibody was confirmed by preincubating the blots with 10 mm 3NT (Sigma). The specificity of the primary 3NT-antibody was further assessed by using the Upstate Biotechnology 3NT immunoblotting control. For identification of eosinophil proteins, target bands (60 and 15 kDa) were cut out from a non-fixed Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE, subjected to tryptic digestion, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF-mass spectrometry (MS). In-gel tryptic digestion was performed as described (26Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar) and modified as outlined below. Briefly, the protein band was excised from the gel, fully de-stained, and digested for 3 h with porcine trypsin (sequencing grade, modified; Promega, Heidelberg, Germany) at a concentration of 67 ng/μl in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.1, at 37 °C. Prior to peptide mass mapping and sequencing of tryptic fragments by tandem mass spectrometry, the peptide mixture was extracted from the gel by two changes of 50% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% water followed by two changes of 50% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile. The combined extracts were vacuum-dried. The dried peptides were re-dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and purified using a ready-to-go pipette tip filled with C18 spherical silica reverse phase material (ZipTipC18™, Millipore GmbH, Schwalbach, Germany). Peptides were eluted with 10 μl of 50% methanol, 1% formic acid, and sequencing was performed by nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry on a hybrid quadrupole orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer (Q-Tof, Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom), equipped with a nanoflow electrospray ionization source. Gold-coated glass capillary nanoflow needles were obtained from Protana (Type Medium NanoES spray capillaries for the Micromass Q-Tof, Odense, Denmark). The needle was filled with 3 μl of the sample and subsequently opened by breaking the tapered end of the tip under a microscope. A stable spray was observed applying a needle voltage of 1200-1400 V, a back pressure of 2 p.s.i., and a source temperature of 40 °C. The estimated flow rate was 20-50 nl/min. For nanoflow electrospray ionization tandem MS experiments, fragmentation was achieved by collision with argon atoms. Q1 was set to the mass of interest, and optimized collision energy was applied. The integration time for the time-of-flight analyzer was 1 s with an interscan delay of 0.1 s. Data base searches (NCBInr, non-redundant protein data base) were done using the MASCOT software from Matrix Science (27Perkins D.N. Pappin D.J. Creasy D.M. Cottrell J.S. Electrophoresis. 1999; 20: 3551-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (6814) Google Scholar). Then, 10 μg of human EPO, MBP, EDN, and ECP (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN) was purified as previously described (28Abu-Ghazaleh R.I. Dunnette S.L. Loegering D.A. Checkel J.L. Kita H. Thomas L.L. Gleich G.J. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1992; 52: 611-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), and 10 μg of murine EPO, MBP, ribonuclease-like protein, and an eosinophil granule lysate from non-inflamed IL-5 transgenic mice (Mayo Clinic, Scottsdale, AZ), were subjected to Western blotting and stained with a 3NT-specific antibody. Mass Spectrometric Identification of Tyr Nitration Structures—Purified EPO was proteolytically digested and the tryptic peptide mixture was separated by HPLC (column PepMap C18 (3 μm, 100 Å, 300-μm inner diameter × 5 cm; LC Packings/Dionex, Idstein, Germany). For the mobile phase a gradient of two solutions (A: 0.1% aqueous solution of HCOOH (Riedel-de Haën, Seelze, Germany); B: 0.1% solution of HCOOH in acetonitrile, 20:80, v/v) (ROTISOLV®, Carl Roth GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) was used with a binary pump flow of 100 μl/min, which was changed after splitting to 4-10 μl/min. ESI-MS analysis of nitrated EPO peptides was performed on an Agilent 1100 system and a Bruker Apex II FT-ICR mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen) equipped with APOLLO II ESI source. The mass spectra were obtained by collecting 32-64 single scans. Experimental conditions were: capillary exit voltage (ΔCS), 45-70 V; setting of skimmer 1, 10; setting of skimmer 2, 7; RF amplitude, 500; ionization pulse time, 2500 ms; ionization delay time, 1 ms; excitation sweep pulse, 1.2 ms; excitation sweep attenuation 1, 2.16 dB. For ECP and EDN, mixtures of proteolytic peptides, carrying Tyr residues, were bound to a microaffinity column with immobilized 3NT antibodies. After washing, bound peptides were eluted by mild acidic treatment and the resulting nitrated peptides were identified by nano-electrospray Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (nano-ESI-FTICR-MS). Prior to proteolytic digestion, cysteine residues of EPO, ECP, and EDN were derivatized (carbamidomethylated) using dithiothreitol and alkylated with iodacetamide. Synthesis of Tyr-nitrated Peptides—The Tyr-nitrated EPO peptide, 333FGHTMLQPFMFRLDSQY(nitro)R350, and the respective non-nitrated peptide, FGHTMLQPFMFRLDSQYR, were synthesized on a semiautomated peptide synthesizer (EPS-221, Abimed, Langenfeld, Germany) with Biotin and a pentaglycine spacer coupled at the final N-terminal amino acid. All peptides were purified by preparative HPLC on a Grom-Sil ODS-4Me column and the exact mass ascertained by MALDI-MS analysis. Structure Modeling—Molecular modeling of EPO was performed using the Swiss-MODEL (swissmodel.expasy.org//SWISS-MODEL.html, an automated comparative protein modeling server). The crystal structure of MPO (PDB code 1DNU) (29Fiedler T.J. Davey C.A. Fenna R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11964-11971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) was used as the target template for homology modeling and further comparative studies. To eliminate model bias, a round of energy minimization was carried out using the CNS package (30Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) after substituting Tyr349 with 3NT-Tyr349. The root mean square deviation between the EPO model and the template MPO prior to energy minimization and after energy minimization is 0.38 and 0.89 Å, respectively. For ECP, structure coordinates from Mohan et al. (35Mohan C.G. Boix E. Evans H.R. Nikolovski Z. Nogues M.V. Cuchillo C.M. Acharya K.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 12100-12106Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) (PDB code 1H1H) were used for nitro-Tyr modeling at the nitro-Tyr33 residue. Cytotoxicity Assays—Confluent monolayers of the human alveolar type II cell line A549 (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikro-organismen und Zellkulturen, Braunschweig, Germany) were used for testing the toxicity of nitrated and non-nitrated eosinophil granule toxins. A549 cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium, supplemented 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 10% fetal calf serum at 37 °C and 5% CO2 on chamber slides (BD Bioscience, Heidelberg, Germany). Non-nitrated recombinant ECP (rECP, Diagnostics Development, Uppsala, Sweden) and rEPO (GenWay, Bio-tech Inc., San Diego, CA) were nitrated using 100 μm KNO2 and 50 μm H2O2 in 20 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for 10 min. The reaction was stopped with 50 μm catalase (Sigma). Nitration was confirmed with Western blotting (data not shown). A549 cells were treated with 20 μm rECP or 5 μm rEPO and the respected nitrated proteins for 24 h. Thereafter, cells were washed and the alive or dead status of the epithelial cells was determined using the Syto13/pro-pidium iodide viability test (Molecular Probes, Leiden, The Netherlands). Ten fluorescence micrographs of each sample were taken at a magnification of ×200 using the Axio Vision program (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The number of dead cells (red fluorescence) was determined as the percentage of total cells (green fluorescence). Antibacterial Assay—Overnight cultures of Escherichia coli strain DH5α and Staphylococcus aureus strain ATCC35556 were washed twice and resuspended in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, to a final concentration of 1.5 × 107 colony forming units/ml. The bacteria were treated with nitrated or non-nitrated 5 μm rECP or 5 μm rEPO for 24 h. The number of surviving bacteria (percentage of total colony forming units) was determined by plating serial 10-fold dilutions on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar. BSA Nitration by Phorbol Myristate Acetate-stimulated Eosinophils—Human eosinophils from three healthy individuals were obtained as described above. The cells were incubated with 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Sigma) in the presence of 4 μg/ml phorbol myristate acetate (Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C in a nitrite/nitrate-free phosphate-buffered saline buffer, pH 7.2. The suspension was centrifuged (1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) and BSA was isolated from the supernatant using the MACS technology (Miltenyi), using albumin antibodies (DAKO). Nitrated BSA was detected by Western blotting using rabbit 3NT antibodies. Identification of Post-translational Nitrated Cationic Proteins in Human and Mouse Eosinophil Secondary Granules—To identify 3NT-positive proteins, lung tissue sections of patients with CF that were also suffering from chronic bacterial lung infection/inflammation were stained with 3NT antibodies and cell markers specific for various cell types. Only eosinophils, i.e. cells staining with MBP, a representative eosinophil marker (2Gleich G.J. Adolphson C.R. Leiferman K.M. Annu. Rev. Med. 1993; 44: 85-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), stained positive for 3NT (Fig. 1, A-D), whereas monocytes, T lymphocytes, mast cells, and neutrophils were 3NT-negative (Fig. 1, E-L). In granulocyte preparations and blood smears from a patient with pronounced eosinophilia, 100% of purified eosinophils, positive for MBP, were 3NT-positive, whereas neutrophils and lymphocytes were completely 3NT-negative (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained in granulocyte preparations and blood smears from a patient with helmintic infection and blood smears from patients with allergic asthma (not shown). The results suggest that the inflammatory process leading to eosinophil activation in these patient groups is responsible for 3NT reactivity. Surprisingly, however, also in granulocyte preparations (Fig. 2B) and lung tissue sections of healthy individuals (Fig. 2C), eosinophils but not other cells stained positive for Tyr nitration. To avoid any activation of"

Genetic engineering of the biosynthetic pathway in the producer strain would provide an efficient and convenient method of generating new derivatives of this complex molecule in vivo. However, the BLM producing Streptomyces verticillus ATCC15003 has been refractory to all means of introducing plasmid DNA into its cells for nearly two decades. Several years after cloning and identification of the bleomycin biosynthetic gene cluster, this study demonstrates, for the first time, genetic accessibility of this pharmaceutically relevant producer strain by intergeneric Escherichia coli-Streptomyces conjugation. Gene replacement and in-frame deletion mutants were created by lambdaRED-mediated PCR targeting mutagenesis, and the secondary metabolite profile of the resultant mutants confirmed the identity of the BLM biosynthetic gene cluster and established its boundaries. Ultimately, the in-frame blmD deletion mutant strain S. verticillus SB5 resulted in the production of a bleomycin intermediate. The structure of this compound, decarbamoyl-BLM, was elucidated, and its DNA cleavage activity was compared with the parent compounds."

This eIF2α modification suppresses global protein synthesis but enhances translation of selected mRNAs such as that for activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). An ATF4 target gene, SNAT2 (system A sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter 2), contains a C/EBP-ATF site that binds ATF4 and triggers increased transcription during the AAR. However, the present studies show that despite increased ATF4 binding to the SNAT2 gene during UPR activation in HepG2 human hepatoma cells, transcription activity was not enhanced. Hyperacetylation of histone H3 and recruitment of the general transcription factors at the HepG2 SNAT2 promoter occurred in response to the AAR but not the UPR. In contrast, the UPR did enhance transcription from a plasmid-based reporter gene driven by a SNAT2 genomic fragment containing the C/EBP-ATF site. Simultaneous activation of the AAR and the UPR pathways revealed that the UPR actually suppressed the increased SNAT2 transcription by the AAR pathway, demonstrating that the UPR pathway generates a repressive signal that acts downstream of ATF4 binding.

Phosphorylation of the translational initiation factor eIF2α at serine 51 by these kinases provokes a suppression of global protein synthesis and a paradoxical increase in the translation of selected mRNAs containing short upstream opening reading frames, including that of activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) (2Vattem K.M.

Cell Biol. 2004; 167: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). One of the eIF2α kinases is double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), which is activated by ER stress conditions, such as perturbation of calcium homeostasis, glucose deprivation, or other causes of misfolded protein accumulation in the ER lumen. Experimentally, the drugs tunicamycin (Tm), an inhibitor of N-glycosylation, or thapsigargin (Tg), an ER Ca2+-ATPase blocker, can also be used to induce the UPR (4Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Bertolotti A. Zeng H. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 897-904Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar). PERK is one component of an adaptive response known as the unfolded protein response (UPR), which is comprised of three signal transduction pathways mediated by the ER membrane-resident stress sensors PERK, IRE1, and ATF6 (4Harding H.P.

In contrast to the UPR, amino acid deprivation leads to an increase in uncharged tRNA, which binds to and activates the eIF2α kinase GCN2 (9Sood R. Porter A.C. Olsen D.A. Cavener D.R. Wek R.C.

Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6681-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). This cascade of events is called the amino acid response (AAR) pathway. Activation of either PERK or GCN2 leads to the induction of specific target genes, as a result of increased ATF4 synthesis (1Wek R.C. Cavener D.R. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2007; 9: 2357-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Amino acid deficiency in yeast results in an increase in GCN4 (the yeast counterpart to ATF4) translation affecting the transcription of hundreds of genes, which has led Hinnebusch and co-workers (11Natarajan K.

Di Padova M. Floridi A. Fanciulli M. Passananti C. FEBS Lett. 2003; 547: 15-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The interactions of ATF4 with its partners appear to be both stress-specific and tissue-specific, and its up-regulation represents a major component of the adaptive AAR and UPR stress responses. ATF4-dependent activation of transcription is mediated through binding to a C/EBP-ATF composite genomic element that is made up of half-sites for the C/EBP and ATF families, respectively (18Fawcett T.W. Martindale J.L. Guyton K.Z. Hai T. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Among the target genes up-regulated by ATF4 is SNAT2 (system A sodium-dependent neutral amino acid transporter 2). Both the expression of SNAT2 gene and its transport activity are up-regulated during amino acid deprivation, hypertonic stress, or hormonal stimulation (19Kilberg M.S. Stevens B.R. Novak D. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1993; 13: 137-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 20McGivan J.D. Pastor-Anglada M. Biochem. J. 1994; 299: 321-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 21Mackenzie B. Erickson J.D. Pfluegers Arch. 2004; 447: 784-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). SNAT2 activity in the liver is induced by glucagon, and its role in supplying alanine and other gluconeogenic amino acids is likely to contribute to the excessive glucose biosynthesis in insulin-dependent diabetes (22Barber E.F. Handlogten M.E. Vida T.A. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 14960-14967Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, system A transport is elevated during the cell cycle and is constitutively high in nearly all transformed cells and tissues (23Saier Jr., M.H. Daniels G.A. Boerner P. Lin J. J. Membr. Biol. 1988; 104: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Its adaptive regulation by substrate supply and hormones, as well as its increased expression in transformed cells and its role in diabetes, makes SNAT2 a potentially attractive therapeutic target. Another ATF4-regulated gene is ASNS (asparagine synthetase). The two cis-acting elements, nutrient sensing response elements 1 and 2 (NSRE-1 and NSRE-2), in the proximal promoter of human ASNS mediate the transcriptional activation of the gene by either the AAR or the UPR pathway (24Barbosa-Tessmann I.P.

Nutr. 2002; 132: 1801-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The NSRE-1 sequence is a C/EBP-ATF composite site that binds ATF4 following activation of either the AAR or the UPR (24Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Siu F. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 50829-50839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In contrast, the ATF4-responsive enhancer element in the SNAT2 gene is composed of a single 9-bp intronic sequence (5′-TGATGCAAT-3′) that is also a C/EBP-ATF composite site but differs in sequence by 2 bp from the ASNS NSRE-1 (5′-TGATGAAAC-3′) (28Palii S.S. Chen H. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3463-3471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Although ATF4 binding to the SNAT2 C/EBP-ATF site has been documented during AAR activation (29Palii S.S. Thiaville M.M. Pan Y.X. Zhong C. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 2006; 395: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), whether or not there is ATF4 binding to SNAT2 during UPR activation has not been investigated. It is interesting to note that despite the increased ATF4 synthesis known to occur during the UPR and the presence of an ATF4-responsive C/EBP-ATF composite site within the SNAT2 gene, the cellular SNAT2 mRNA content and transport activity are not induced in response to UPR activation (30Bain P.J. LeBlanc-Chaffin R. Chen H. Palii S.S. Leach K.M. Kilberg M.S. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 3023-3029Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This study was designed to explore the differences in the mechanisms for transcriptional control of the SNAT2 gene during UPR and AAR activation. Three questions were addressed. 1) Does ATF4 bind to the SNAT2 C/EBP-ATF composite site during the UPR? 2) Is ATF4 binding to the C/EBP-ATF site the determinant event that induces SNAT2 gene transcription? 3) Are other components of the general transcriptional machinery assembled on the SNAT2 gene during the UPR? The experiments revealed that SNAT2 transcriptional activity remains at the basal level in the presence of ER stress despite increased synthesis of ATF4 and its subsequent enhanced binding to the SNAT2 C/EBP-ATF composite site. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis revealed no increase in histone H3 acetylation or general transcription factor (GTF) recruitment to the SNAT2 promoter following activation of the UPR pathway. Simultaneous activation of both pathways indicated that the UPR generates a suppressive signal that blocks the AAR-induced SNAT2 transcription activity downstream of ATF4 binding. Antibodies—The following antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA): ATF3, sc-188; ATF4 (CREB-2), sc-200; C/EBPβ, sc-150, sc-7962; RNA pol II, sc-899; TFIID (TBP), sc-204; TFIIB, sc-274; TFIIE-α, sc-237; and normal rabbit IgG, sc-2027. An ATF4 rabbit antiserum produced by Cocalico Biologicals (Reamstown, PA) was used for ATF4 protein immunoblotting. Antibodies against acetylated histone H3 (number 06-599, recognizes acetylated Lys-9 and Lys-14) and acetylated histone H4 (number 06-866, recognizes acetylated H4 at Lys 5, -8, -12, and -16) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Millipore). Cell Culture—HepG2 human hepatoma cells and BNL-CL2 immortalized mouse fetal hepatocytes were cultured in modified Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM; pH 7.4) (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air. The 293 human kidney cells, human fibroblasts, human MDA breast cancer cells, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's MEM. Both media were supplemented with 1× nonessential amino acids, 2 mm glutamine, 100 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate, 100 units/ml penicillin G, 0.25 mg/ml amphotericin B, and 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum. Cells were replenished with fresh medium and serum 12 h before all experiments, to ensure that little or no nutrient deprivation occurred prior to initiating drug treatments. To induce the UPR pathway, cells were incubated for a specific time in medium lacking glucose or containing either 300 nm thapsigargin or 5 μg/ml tunicamycin. To activate the AAR, cells were incubated in medium either lacking the amino acid histidine (Invitrogen) or in complete medium supplemented with 1 or 2 mm l-histidinol (HisOH). HisOH blocks charging of histidine onto the corresponding tRNA (31Hansen B.S. Vaughan M.H. Wang L.-J. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 3854-3857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and thus mimics histidine deprivation thereby triggering activation of the AAR cascade (32den Boer M.L. Pieters R. Kazemier K.M. Rottier M.M.A. Zwaan C.M. Kaspers G.J.L. Janka-Schaub G. Henze G. Creutzig U. Scheper R.J. Veerman A.J.P. Blood. 1998; 91: 2092-2098Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33van Huizen R. Martindale J.L. Gorospe M. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 15558-15564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). We have documented that HisOH treatment mirrors histidine-deficient medium with regard to induction of transcription (34Hutson R.G. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 745-750Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 35Thiaville M.M. Dudenhausen E.E. Zhong C. Pan Y.X. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 2008; 410: 473-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). For incubations using histidine deprivation, the medium was supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Sigma). Immunoblot Analysis—After incubation in MEM only, MEM + HisOH, or MEM + Tg for 0–12 h, total cell extracts were prepared for immunoblot analysis. Protein content was quantified by a Lowry assay, and 30 μg of protein were separated on a pre-cast Criterion Tris/HCl polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad). After electrotransfer to a Bio-Rad nitrocellulose membrane, the membrane was stained with Fast Green to check for equal loading and then incubated with 5% blocking solution (5% (w/v) Carnation nonfat dry milk and Tris-buffered saline/Tween (30 mm Tris base, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20)) for 1 h at room temperature with mixing. Immunoblotting for ATF4 was performed using a rabbit serum containing a polyclonal antibody against the ATF4 at a dilution of 1:5000 in 5% dry milk blocking solution for 5 h at room temperature with mixing. The membrane was washed (one time for 5 min and two times for 10 min) in TBS-T solution (30 mm Tris base, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) on a shaker and then incubated with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) at a 1:10,000 dilution in 5% dry milk blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature with mixing. The membrane was then washed (1 × 5 min, 3 × 10 min) in TBS-T solution. The bound secondary antibody was detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Biosciences) and exposing the membrane to Biomax® MR film (Eastman Kodak Co.). To provide a demonstration of equal loading beyond the Fast Green staining, some membranes were re-probed with a 1:5000 dilution of an antibody specific for β-actin (Sigma). Transcriptional Activity Determination—Total RNA was isolated using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen), including DNase I treatment before the final elution to eliminate any DNA contamination. To measure the transcriptional activity, qRT-RCR was used to amplify a product spanning the human SNAT2 exon 4 and intron 4 junction, the mouse SNAT2 exon 13 and intron 13 junction, the ASNS intron 12 and exon 13 junction, and the BiP/GRP78 exon 2 and intron 2 junction to measure the short lived unspliced transcript heterogeneous nuclear RNA (hnRNA). This procedure for measuring transcriptional activity is based on that described by Lipson and Baserga (36Lipson K.E. Baserga R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9774-9777Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), except that we analyzed hnRNA levels by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) using the DNA Engine Opticon 2 system (Bio-Rad) and SYBR Green. Reactions without RT were performed as a negative control to rule out amplification from any residual genomic DNA. These tests were always negative. The transcription activity primers for amplification were as follows: for human SNAT2, sense 5′-GCAGTGGAATCCTTGGGCTTTC-3′ and antisense 5′-CCCTGCATGGCAGACTCACTACTTA-3′; for mouse SNAT2, sense 5′-GTCACCCTCACGGTCCCAGTAGTTA-3′ and antisense 5′-GCATACCCATAGCTGTCGCAGAAGT-3′; for ASNS, sense 5′-CCTGCCATTTTAAGCCATTTTGC-3′ and antisense 5′-TGGGCTGCATTTGCCATCATT-3′; and those for BiP/GRP78, sense 5′-AGGACATCAAGTTCTTGCCGTTCA-3′ and antisense 5′-CACCACCCACCCGTTCTCTAACT-3′. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 48 °C for 30 min followed by 95 °C for 10 min to activate the Taq polymerase and amplification of 35 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 63 °C (SNAT2), 58 °C (ASNS), or 60 °C (BiP) for 60 s. After PCR, melting curves were acquired by stepwise increase of the temperature from 55 to 95 °C to ensure that a single product was amplified in the reaction. The housekeeping gene glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a negative control for the drug-induced stress and as an indicator of the variation for the quantitative real time PCR analysis. The primers used to measure relative mRNA levels for GAPDH were as follows: sense primer 5′-TTGGTATCGTGGAAGGACTC-3′ and antisense primer, 5′-ACAGTCTTCTGGGTGGCAGT-3′. The SNAT2, ASNS, and BiP/GRP78 hnRNA values were determined relative to an RNA standard curve. The RNA was also analyzed for GAPDH mRNA content, which was unchanged by the AAR or UPR pathways, as a control to demonstrate that equal amounts of total RNA were used for hnRNA measurement. The PCRs were performed in duplicate for each sample, and samples were collected from at least three independent experiments. Values are expressed as means ± S.E. ChIP—ChIP analysis was performed according to our previously published protocol (27Chen H. Pan Y.X. Dudenhausen E.E. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 50829-50839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 95 °C for 10 min, followed by amplification at 95 °C for 15 s and either 60 °C (SNAT2 C/EBP-ATF enhancer primers), 62 °C (SNAT2 promoter primers), or 61.4 °C (ASNS promoter primers) for 60 s for 35 cycles. The SNAT2 promoter primers were as follows: sense primer 5′-GCCGCCTTAGAACGCCTTTC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-TCCGCCGTGTCAAGGGAA-3′. The human SNAT2 C/EBP-ATF enhancer primers were as follows: sense 5′-GGGAAGACGAGTTGGGAACATTTG-3′ and antisense 5′-CCCTCCTATGTCCGGAAAGAAAAC-3′ and the mouse SNAT2 C/EBP-ATF site primers were as follows: sense 5′-ATCGGGTCTTGTGCCTCGAAA-3′ and antisense 5′-ATACCGAGGGGCGATTGATTGT-3′. The SNAT2 primers for exon 10 were as follows: sense 5′-CAGGTACAAGAGCTGTTGGCTGTGT-3 and antisense 5′-GTGTCCTGTGGAAGCTGCTTTGA-3′. The ASNS proximal promoter primers, where the C/EBP-ATF enhancer site is located (24Barbosa-Tessmann I.P. Chen C. Zhong C. Siu F. Schuster S.M. Nick H.S. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 26976-26985Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), were as follows: sense 5′-TGGTTGGTCCTCGCAGGCAT-3′ and antisense 5′-CGCTTATACCGACCTGGCTCCT-3′. Transient Transfections—HepG2 human hepatoma cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 1.2 × 105 cells/well, supplied with complete MEM, and grown for 24 h. Transfection was performed with 1 μg of Firefly luciferase reporter driven by the SNAT2 genomic fragment of nt -512 to +770 that contains both the proximal promoter and the intronic C/EBP-ATF enhancer site (28Palii S.S. Chen H. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3463-3471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 29Palii S.S. Thiaville M.M. Pan Y.X. Zhong C. Kilberg M.S. Biochem. J. 2006; 395: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To generate a C/EBP-ATF mutant sequence, a plasmid containing the human SNAT2 sequence from nt -512/+770 was used as a template, and mutagenesis was performed with the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The identity and fidelity of the constructs were verified by sequencing. The wild type sequence 5′-TATTGCATCA-3′ was mutated to 5′-TAATGCCCCA-3′, and the mutagenic primers used have been described previously (28Palii S.S. Chen H. Kilberg M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 3463-3471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Transfection of 1.2 × 105 cells was accomplished using Superfect reagent at a ratio of 1:6 μg of DNA/μl reagent, according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Each well also received 10 ng of pRL-SV40 plasmid (Renilla luciferase) to serve as a control for transfection efficiency. The amount of co-transfected transcription factor expression plasmid was 100 ng/well, and the total amount of transfected DNA was kept constant among experimental groups by the addition of empty pcDNA3.1 plasmid. After 3 h, cells were rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and given fresh MEM. At 16 h post-transfection, the medium was removed; the cells were rinsed once with PBS and incubated for 10 h in 1 ml/well of either complete MEM or MEM lacking histidine (MEM-His) to induce the AAR or MEM lacking glucose or containing 300 nm Tg or 5 μg/ml Tm to induce the UPR, each supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. After the completion of treatment, the cells were rinsed with PBS, lysed with 100 μl of 1× Passive lysis buffer (Promega), and then subjected to one freeze-thaw cycle to ensure complete disruption of the membranes. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Replicates of six transfections were performed for each experimental condition, and all experiments were repeated with separate batches of cells to ensure reproducibility of results. Short Interfering RNA (siRNA) Transfection—The human ATF3, XBP1, ATF6α, and ATF6β (CREBL1) siGENOME SMARTpool (Dharmacon M-008663-01-0005, M-009552-02-0005; M-009917-00-0005; M-008805-00-0005), siControl nontargeting siRNA (D-001210-02), and DharmaFECT 4 transfection reagent were purchased from Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette, CO). HepG2 cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 4 × 105 cells per well in MEM and grown for 16 h. Transfection was performed according to Dharmacon's instructions using 3 μl of DharmaFECT-4 and 100 nm per well final siRNA concentration. HepG2 cells were treated with transfection reagent for 24 h and then rinsed with PBS, given fresh MEM, and cultured for another 24 h. The medium was then removed and replaced with control MEM or MEM +Tg. At 8 h, protein extracts and total RNA were isolated and analyzed by immunoblotting (described above) or RT-PCR, respectively. To monitor mRNA, the primers were as follows: for ATF6α (sense 5′-GGAACAGGATTCCAGGAGAATGAACCCTAGTG-3′; antisense5′-GATGTGTCCTGTGCCTCTTTAGCAGAAAATCC-3′), for ATF6β (CREBL1) (sense 5′-CTGAAGCGGCAGCAGCGAATGATCAAG-3′; antisense 5′-CGAGCCTCCAGTCCCTGCAGATACTCTTTC-3′), and for XBP1 (sense 5′-CAGAGTAGCAGCTCAGACTGCCAGAGATCG-3′; antisense 5′-GCTGTTCCAGCTCACTCATTCGAGCC-3′). SNAT2 Transcriptional Activity Is Induced during AAR Activation but Not during UPR Activation—Despite the prediction that ER stress will activate C/EBP-ATF-containing genes via ATF4 action, previous studies have reported that the steady state mRNA content for SNAT2 is increased after amino acid deprivation but not after treatment of HepG2 human hepatoma cells to induce ER stress (30Bain P.J. LeBlanc-Chaffin R. Chen H. Palii S.S. Leach K.M. Kilberg M.S. J. Nutr. 2002; 132: 3023-3029Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To extend those observations, we monitored the effect of Tg treatment on SNAT2 transcription activity in several cell types (Fig. 1). The basal rate of SNAT2 transcription between cell types was quite variable (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the UPR insensitivity of the SNAT2 gene was cell-specific (Fig. 1, B and C). Human kidney cells (293) and breast cancer cells (MDA) both exhibited increased SNAT2 transcription activity, whereas normal human fibroblasts, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), and mouse fetal liver cells (BNL-CL2) did not respond to ER stress. For the HepG2 human hepatoma cells and the mouse BNL-CL2 cells, the SNAT2 responsiveness to amino acid limitation was tested, and in both cell types transcription was induced as expected (Fig. 1C). These observations are consistent with the proposal that the UPR plays different roles in different cell types (1Wek R.C. Cavener D.R. Antioxid. Redox. Signal. 2007; 9: 2357-2371Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). To further investigate the mechanism of the UPR insensitivity, the time course for SNAT2 transcription activity during UPR or AAR activation was measured in HepG2 hepatoma cells (Fig. 2, top panel). The results revealed that the activity of the SNAT2 gene during AAR activation by HisOH started to increase at 2 h, peaked at 8 h with a 4-fold increase, and then declined at the 12-h time point. In contrast, after activation of the UPR by Tg, the SNAT2 transcriptional activity transiently fluctuated upward at 4 h but by 8 h had returned to the basal le"

To determine the properties of NfuA, recombinant NfuA from Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 was overproduced and purified. In vitro reconstituted NfuA contained oxygen- and EDTA-labile Fe/S cluster(s), which had EPR properties consistent with [4Fe-4S] clusters. After reconstitution with 57Fe2+, Mössbauer studies of NfuA showed a broad quadrupole doublet that confirmed the presence of [4Fe-4S]2+ clusters. Native gel electrophoresis under anoxic conditions and chemical cross-linking showed that holo-NfuA forms dimers and tetramers harboring Fe/S cluster(s). Combined with iron and sulfide analyses, the results indicated that one [4Fe-4S] cluster was bound per NfuA dimer. Fe/S cluster transfer from holo-NfuA to apo-PsaC of PS I was studied by reconstitution of PS I complexes using P700-F(X) core complexes, PsaD, apo-PsaC, and holo-NfuA. Electron transfer measurements by time-resolved optical spectroscopy showed that holo-NfuA rapidly and efficiently transferred [4Fe-4S] clusters to PsaC in a reaction that required contact between the two proteins. The NfuA-reconstituted PS I complexes had typical charge recombination kinetics from [F(A)/F(B)](-) to P700+ and light-induced low-temperature EPR spectra. These results establish that cyanobacterial NfuA can act as a scaffolding protein for the insertion of [4Fe-4S] clusters into PsaC of PS I in vitro."
https://openalex.org/W2027325467,"To better understand the mechanisms underlying the role of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain gene (IgH) 3' enhancers on bcl-2 transcriptional deregulation in t(14;18) lymphoma, we characterized the physical interactions of the IgH 3' enhancer region with the bcl-2 promoters. Using the chromosome conformation capture technique, we found that the IgH 3' enhancers physically interact with the bcl-2 promoter region over a 350 kb genomic region in t(14;18) lymphoma cells. No interactions of the bcl-2 promoter region with sequences distant to the IgH enhancers were observed. The physical interactions of the IgH enhancers with the bcl-2 5' region are functionally involved in the transcriptional control of bcl-2. The histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, repressed bcl-2 transcription and decreased the IgH enhancer-bcl-2 promoter region interactions. We showed by chromatin immunoprecipitation assay and small interference RNA transfection studies that the POU2 family transcription factor Oct-2 and its cofactor Bob-1 have an important function in mediating the IgH enhancer-bcl-2 promoter region interactions. This study reveals a new aspect of the regulatory role of the IgH 3' enhancers on bcl-2 transcription in t(14;18) lymphomas."
https://openalex.org/W2149189186,"CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT), a rate-limiting enzyme in phosphatidylcholine synthesis, is regulated by reversible membrane interactions mediated by an amphipathic helical domain (M) that binds selectively to anionic lipids. CCT is a dimer; thus the functional unit has two M domains. To probe the functional contribution of each domain M we prepared a CCT heterodimer composed of one full-length subunit paired with a CCT subunit truncated before domain M that was also catalytically dead. We compared this heterodimer to the fulllength homodimer with respect to activation by anionic vesicles, vesicle binding affinities, and promotion of vesicle aggregation. Surprisingly for all three functions the dimer with just one domain M behaved similarly to the dimer with two M domains. Full activation of the wild-type subunit was not impaired by loss of one domain M in its partner. Membrane binding affinities were the same for dimers with one versus two M domains, suggesting that the two M domains of the dimer do not engage a single bilayer simultaneously. Vesicle cross-bridging was also unhindered by loss of one domain M, suggesting that another motif couples with domain M for cross-bridging anionic membranes. Mutagenesis revealed that the positively charged nuclear localization signal sequence constitutes that second motif for membrane cross-bridging. We propose that the two M domains of the CCT dimer engage a single bilayer via an alternating binding mechanism. The tethering function involves the cooperation of domain M and the nuclear localization signal sequence, each engaging separate membranes. Membrane binding of a single M domain is sufficient to fully activate the enzymatic activity of the CCT dimer while sustaining the low affinity, reversible membrane interaction required for regulation of CCT activity.

Membrane binding of a single M domain is sufficient to fully activate the enzymatic activity of the CCT dimer while sustaining the low affinity, reversible membrane interaction required for regulation of CCT activity. Many amphitropic proteins have multiple membrane binding domains that serve to enhance binding affinity and to enable differential regulation by various lipid ligands. Multiple binding domains may in some cases enable a stepwise process leading to full activation of the enzyme. For example several protein kinase C isoforms have a C2 domain and two C1 domains that bind acidic lipids and diacylglycerol, respectively, with full activation dependent on engagement of both types of membrane binding modules (1Johnson J.E.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1194) Google Scholar). CCT, the rate-limiting enzyme in PC synthesis, is a well studied amphitropic enzyme whose weak, reversible binding is mediated by domain M, a long amphipathic helix (4Cornell R.B. Northwood I.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 441-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Domain M is situated just downstream of the catalytic domain in the linear sequence and is followed by a flexible, unstructured domain housing multiple phosphorylation sites. Domain M is an autoinhibitory domain as evidenced by constitutive activity resulting from deletion of domain M (5Friesen J.A. Campbell H.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13384-13389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Upon membrane engagement the autoinhibition at the active site is relieved resulting in ∼100-fold enhancement of kcat. Thus lipids activate the enzyme by entrapping an autoinhibitory domain. The predominant CCTα isoform contains a polybasic nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence within domain N (12RKRRK16) that directs CCT into the nucleus of many but not all cells where it translocates on and off the nuclear envelope in response to changes in the lipid composition of that membrane. Two classes of lipids have been shown to promote CCTα membrane localization in vitro and in vivo: anionic lipids and type II lipids such as unsaturated phosphatidylethanolamine and diacylglycerol (4Cornell R.B. Northwood I.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 441-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The soluble form of CCTα is a homodimer (367 amino acids per monomer) (6Weinhold P.A. Rounsifer M.E. Charles L. Feldman D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 1006: 299-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 7Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9077-9082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Xie M. Smith J.L. Ding Z. Zhang D. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28817-28825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar); thus the functional unit may have two M domains. The N-terminal domain consisting of domain N (residues 1 to ∼75) plus the catalytic domain C (residues 76–236) is sufficient to mediate non-covalent dimerization (5Friesen J.A. Campbell H.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13384-13389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 8Xie M. Smith J.L. Ding Z. Zhang D. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28817-28825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). CCT236, comprised of domains N + C, is catalytically active as a dimer (5Friesen J.A. Campbell H.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13384-13389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Early models of CCT activation by membrane interaction envisioned two M domains of a dimer engaging the same bilayer in a cis mode (4Cornell R.B. Northwood I.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 441-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 9Craig L. Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3311-3317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, Model I). Later the discovery that CCTα can cross-bridge vesicles and that domain M is required for this process suggested a trans mode in which each M domain engages a separate bilayer because of the positioning of the M domains on opposite poles of the N + C dimerization domains (Fig. 1, Model II). The trans mode of binding resulting in vesicle cross-bridging has only been detected with highly anionic vesicles (≥33 mol % anionic) (10Taneva S.G. Patty P.J. Frisken B.J. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9382-9393Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Membrane binding of CCT was associated with a loss of chemical cross-linking efficiency across the dimer interface, suggesting that membrane binding induces a rearrangement of its dimer interface (8Xie M. Smith J.L. Ding Z. Zhang D. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28817-28825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although the dimer interface may reorganize, it is likely that the enzyme remains dimeric when membrane-bound and fully active for several reasons. First, it can tether two anionic vesicles as manifested by vesicle aggregation (10Taneva S.G. Patty P.J. Frisken B.J. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9382-9393Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Second, limited proteolysis showed that the sites within domain C that form the dimer interface remained inaccessible in the membrane form as well as the soluble form of CCT (11Bogan M.J. Agnes G.R. Pio F. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 19613-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). If membrane binding were to dissociate the dimer into monomers the dimer interface would have become highly accessible to proteases. Third, CCT binding to and activation by lipid vesicles enriched in diacylglycerol does not reduce cross-linking efficiency. 4R. B. Cornell, unpublished data. 4R. B. Cornell, unpublished data. Lastly, a truncated form of CCT missing domains M + P is a constitutively active dimer (5Friesen J.A. Campbell H.A. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13384-13389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), showing that the dimeric form is compatible with activity. Why is CCT a dimer? Is the dimeric structure important for enhancement of membrane binding, for enabling membrane cross-bridging, and/or for regulation of activity by sequential binding of the M domains? Is the binding of each domain M so weak that two such domains are essential for maintaining CCT in its membrane-bound active conformation? Does membrane engagement of both M domains affect the active site of a single subunit in a way that engagement of only one domain M cannot? To probe these questions we prepared a heterodimer composed of one subunit of the full-length CCTα (CCT367) and one subunit of a CCT truncated before domain M (CCT236). Comparing the catalytic activity of the 367 subunit in the full-length homodimer (CCT367) versus heterodimer (CCT367/236) in the presence of saturating lipid vesicles and saturating substrates would reveal the contribution of each domain M-lipid engagement to the activation process. We found that the dimer with only one domain M had a specific activity similar to that of the dimer with two M domains. The explanation for this surprising result emerged from another surprising finding that the homo- and heterodimer had the same binding affinity for PG/PC vesicles. Thus only one domain M at a time engages these membranes even when the CCT dimer has two such domains. We present arguments that activation of the two catalytic domains is highly cooperative, requiring the membrane engagement of only one M domain. Our finding that only one domain M is needed for membrane cross-bridging led us to the discovery of the N-terminal NLS as a second membrane interaction motif. Egg PC and egg PG were purchased from Northern Lipids Inc. (Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada). The concentrations of phospholipid chloroform stocks were determined with a phosphorus assay (12Bartlett G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1959; 234: 466-468Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phosphoryl [methyl-14C]choline, ammonium salt, the ECL Western blotting detection kit, SYPRO Orange protein gel stain, and thrombin protease were from Amersham Biosciences. Ni-NTA-agarose was purchased from Qiagen, and AcTEV protease was from Invitrogen. CTP, dithiothreitol, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Triton X-100, imidazole, SDS, and α-chymotrypsin were obtained from Sigma. The full-length untagged rat CCTα isoform and CCT236 (truncated at codon 236) were expressed by baculovirus infection of Trichoplusia ni cells and purified as described previously (13Davies S.M. Epand R.M. Kraayenhof R. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10522-10531Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 14Taneva S. Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11768-11776Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Purified proteins were stored in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT (Buffer A) at –80 °C. pET14b-HisCCT236(K122A)—The Lys → Ala mutation was engineered at codon 122 using the QuikChange mutagenesis method (Stratagene) and the template pVL1392-HisCCT236. The correct CCT sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. For expression in Escherichia coli an NdeI site was engineered just 5′ of the CCT coding region by standard PCR methods using pVL1392-HisCCT236(K122A) as a template and a 3′ primer complementary to the vector sequence. The 750-bp PCR product encompassing codons 1–236 was digested with NdeI and BamHI and ligated into NdeI/BamHI-digested pET14b to engineer an N-terminal His6 tag followed by a thrombin cleavage site. pAX142-HisCCT(K122A)—A 261-bp EcoRV/SspI fragment from pET14b-His236(K122A) encompassing codon 122 was prepared. It was ligated into a COS cell expression vector, pAX142 (15Walkey C.J. Kalmar G.B. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5742-5749Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), containing a His6 tag and a TEV protease site upstream of WT full-length CCTα after excision of the corresponding EcoRV/SspI 261-bp fragment. pAX142-HisCCT(ΔNLS)—Codons 12–16 encoding the nuclear localization sequence were deleted by the QuikChange method (Stratagene) using a pair of complementary primers and the template HisCCT236 in pBS (KS–). The mutation was confirmed by DNA sequencing. A 292-bp MluI/SspI fragment of pBS-HisCCT(Δ12–16) containing the deleted codons was ligated with the 3849-bp Mlu1/Ssp1 fragment of pAX142-HisCCT. This HisCCT(Δ12–16) construct contained a Factor Xa cleavage site between the His tag and the CCT sequence. We later discovered, after expression, purification, and digestion of this construct, that cleavage of full-length CCTα with Factor Xa is not strictly confined to the site in the linker. Thus we replaced the Xa site with a TEV site, which cleaves faithfully only at the linker site. The 512-bp BglII/EcoRV fragment of pAX-HisCCT(Δ12–16) (CCT codons 1–168 + eight-nucleotide 5′ extension) was ligated with the 3626-bp EcoRV/BglII fragment of pBS-His-TEV site-CCT to yield pBS-His-TEV site-CCT(Δ12–16). Then the 566-bp MluI/EcoRV fragment of pBS-His-TEV site-CCT(Δ12–16), extending from 5′ of the His tag to codon 170 of CCT, was ligated with the 3599-bp MluI/EcoRV fragment of pAX-HisCCT to yield pAX-His-TEV site-CCT(ΔNLS). pET14b-HisCCT236(K122A; ΔNLS)—This construct was made in two steps. First a 636-bp EcoRI fragment encompassing CCT codons 31–236 and the K122A mutation was obtained from pVL1392-HisCCT236(K122A). It was ligated with a 3.1-kb EcoRI fragment from pBS-His-TEV site-CCT(Δ12–16) to generate pBS-His-TEV site-CCT236(K122A; Δ12–16). In step 2 the CCT-encoding 800-bp fragment from this construct was ligated with the 5-kb vector fragment of pET14b-His-thrombin site-CCT236(K122A) using NdeI and BamHI sites just upstream of the TEV site and downstream of the stop codon, respectively. Expression of the pET14b-CCT236 constructs used the Rosetta strain of E. coli (derived from BL-21). Rosetta cells transformed with these plasmids (250 ml) were cultured to an optical density of ≈0.8. CCT proteins were expressed by induction with 0.4 mm isopropylthio-β-d-galactoside for 4 h at 28 °C. To purify His-tagged CCT236 proteins from E. coli cells, the cell pellet from a 250-ml cell culture was incubated for 5 min at 37 °C in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mg/ml lysozyme, 10 μg/ml deoxyribonuclease I, six protease inhibitors (16MacDonald J.I. Kent C. Protein Expr. Purif. 1993; 4: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and lysed by sonication on ice 4 × 15 s with a 20-s rest between bursts. To the lysate we added 0.1 volume of 10× binding buffer (50 mm Na2PO4, 5 m NaCl, 150 mm imidazole) with mixing. The lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant containing ∼18 mg of protein was applied to a Ni-NTA-agarose column (1.5-ml bed volume). The nickel resin was washed, and the His-tagged CCTs were eluted as described previously (8Xie M. Smith J.L. Ding Z. Zhang D. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28817-28825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Full-length CCTs in the pAX142 vector were expressed transiently in COS-1 cells by transfection using DEAE-dextran (17Johnson J.E. Xie M. Singh L.M. Edge R. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 514-522Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Transfection times were 64 h for pAX-HisCCT(K122A) and 48 h for pAX-HisCCT(ΔNLS). Longer expression times for the latter led to higher protein expression but also decreased solubility. To purify His-tagged CCT367 proteins from COS cells, cells from 10 15-cm dishes were harvested with phosphate-buffered saline, 2.5 mm EDTA, and the cell pellet was homogenized by sonication on ice in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, six protease inhibitors (16MacDonald J.I. Kent C. Protein Expr. Purif. 1993; 4: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To the cell lysate (∼8 mg of cell protein in 7.5 ml) we added 0.1 volume of 10× binding buffer, and the lysate was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant (∼7 mg of protein) was applied to a Ni-NTA-agarose column (1.2-ml bed volume). The nickel resin was washed, and the His-tagged CCTs were eluted as described previously (8Xie M. Smith J.L. Ding Z. Zhang D. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28817-28825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The eluted HisCCTs were dialyzed against 500 volumes of 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.15 mm Triton X-100, 2 mm DTT (HisCCT236 proteins) or 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.15 mm Triton X-100, 2 mm DTT (HisCCT367 proteins) for 3 h at 4°C with one buffer change to remove the imidazole and stored at –80 °C. The concentrations of the pure enzymes were determined by the method of Bradford (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211734) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. For some experiments the His tag of HisCCT236(K122A) was removed by digestion with thrombin protease (1 unit/35 μg of His-tagged protein) at 4 °C for ∼16 h. The cleavage reaction in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 0.15 mm Triton X-100, 2 mm DTT (PBST Buffer) was quenched with a mixture of protease inhibitors (1 μg/ml antipain, 2 μg/ml chymostatin, 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin), and the sample was dialyzed for 3 h at 4 °C against the same buffer to remove the His peptide. The His tag of His-TEV-CCT(ΔNLS) was cleaved by digestion with AcTEV protease (1 unit/1.4 μg of His-tagged protein) at 4 °C for ∼16 h in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm Triton X-100, 2 mm DTT. At the end of the cleavage reaction imidazole (15 mm) was added to block non-specific binding. Ni-NTA-agarose beads were added (∼0.1 μl/μg of CCT), and the sample was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 1 min CCT(ΔNLS) was recovered in the supernatant; the His-AcTEV protease and traces of uncleaved His-TEV-CCT(ΔNLS) remained bound to the resin. Native dimers of CCT367 and catalytically inactive HisCCT236(K122A) were dissociated into monomers by incubation in Buffer A with 1 mm SDS at a 70:1 SDS/protein molar ratio at 37 °C for 15 min. Disruption of dimers was indicated by loss of glutaraldehyde-mediated covalent cross-linking of the two subunits as assessed by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The CCT367/His236(K122A) heterodimer was formed by mixing the SDS-treated CCT367 and HisCCT236(K122A) in a 1:1 molar ratio followed by a 5-min incubation at 37 °C. Spontaneous reassociation of the protein monomers was initiated by 1:1 dilution in Buffer A followed by removal of the SDS by overnight dialysis at 4 °C. Sample containing the three reconstituted CCT dimers was applied to a Ni-NTA-agarose column and processed as described above. The untagged CCT367 homodimer was recovered in the flow-through fraction; CCT367/His236(K122A) and HisCCT236(K122A) dimers co-eluted with 350 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. Because the HisCCT236(K122A) homodimer is catalytically inactive it should not affect activity measurements with the heterodimer. The CCT dimers in the flow-through and eluted fractions were dialyzed for 3 h at 4°C against PBST Buffer and stored at –80 °C. The concentration of the active CCT367 subunit in the CCT367/His236(K122A) heterodimer was determined as follows. First, the two proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, quantitatively stained with SYPRO Orange, and imaged with a Typhoon 9410 imager. The ratio, R = [CCT367]/[HisCCT236(K122A)], was determined by densitometry (Image Quant). Second, the total protein concentration, [CCT367] + [HisCCT236(K122A)], was determined (18Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211734) Google Scholar), and the two equations were used to calculate [CCT367] and [HisCCT236(K122A)] in the mixture. The same procedures were used to make and quantify a CCT367/His367(K122A) heterodimer, which co-eluted with the catalytically inactive HisCCT367(K122A) homodimer. Initially we tried to make a heterodimer in vitro from GST-tagged CCT367 and HisCCT236(K122A) homodimers using the same procedure of dissociation/reassociation of the dimers followed by two-step affinity chromatography on Ni-NTA and glutathione-Sepharose. However we could not find conditions appropriate to dissociate both the CCT and GST dimers: 1–3 mm SDS used to dissociate the CCT dimers was not sufficient to dissociate the GST dimers, and some of the treatments used to achieve monomerization of GST, e.g. 15–30% acetonitrile (19Vargo M.A. Colman R.F. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1586-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), failed to dissociate the CCT dimers. Protein samples (∼20 μg/ml) in PBST Buffer were incubated with 1 mm glutaraldehyde at 37 °C for 15 min. The cross-linking reaction was quenched with ethanolamine (0.1 m final concentration). The cross-linked samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (10% gels) and silver staining (20Poehling H.-M. Neuhoff V. Electrophoresis. 1981; 2: 141-147Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar) or by Western analysis using antibodies against residues 164–176 of the catalytic domain (8Xie M. Smith J.L. Ding Z. Zhang D. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28817-28825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) or residues 256–288 of domain M (21Johnson J.E. Aebersold R. Cornell R.B. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1324: 273-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The tertiary structure of native and reconstituted CCT dimers was assessed by limited chymotrypsin digestion (9Craig L. Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3311-3317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Taneva S. Johnson J.E. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 11768-11776Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Samples contained 2.0 μg of CCT in Buffer A and a 1:220 weight ratio of chymotrypsin/CCT. Reactions were quenched after various times at 37 °C with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The fragments were separated by SDS-PAGE (12% gels) and visualized with silver stain (20Poehling H.-M. Neuhoff V. Electrophoresis. 1981; 2: 141-147Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar). CCT activity was determined essentially as described previously (22Sohal P.S. Cornell R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11746-11750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A standard reaction mixture contained 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm DTT, 88 mm NaCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 16 mm CTP, 2.5 mm [14C]phosphocholine (specific activity, 1 mCi/mmol), enzyme dimer concentration of 14 nm, and 0.2 mm PC/PG (1:1, mol/mol) small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs). SUVs were prepared as described previously (23Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5881-5888Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Reactions were at 37 °C for 10 min. To analyze the response of CCT dimers to variable concentrations of PG vesicles, enzyme velocity measurements were conducted using the standard assay conditions, but the concentration of lipid was varied from 0.1 to 50 μm. For this analysis LUVs were prepared (13Davies S.M. Epand R.M. Kraayenhof R. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 10522-10531Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) by extrusion of multilamellar vesicles at room temperature through two 100-nm polycarbonate membranes (Lipofast Micro-extruder, Avestin, Ontario, Canada). LUVs were in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT and contained trace amounts of 1,2-[3H]dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine to allow quantification of recovery after extrusion. Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4 software by non-linear regression fit to a one-site binding equation: V = Vmax[L]/(K½ + [L]) where [L] is the molar concentration of accessible lipid. The maximal activity Vmax and the K½, an apparent dissociation constant that measures the strength of binding between lipid and protein (24Yang W. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16503-16506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 25Helmink B.A. Friesen J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1683: 78-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), were determined. The K½ is equivalent to the reciprocal of Kp, which is described below. The kinetic parameters Vmax, kcat, and Km with respect to phosphocholine and CTP were determined using primary plots of the enzyme velocity versus substrate concentration ([S]). Phosphocholine was varied from 0.1 to 3.5 mm in the presence of 16 mm CTP, and CTP was varied from 0.2 to 15 mm in the presence of 2.5 mm phosphocholine. The velocity versus [S] data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 4 software and were fit to the Michaelis-Menten equation: V = Vmax[S]/(Km + [S]) where Vmax is the velocity extrapolated to infinite substrate concentration and Km is the Michaelis constant. Binding of CCT dimers to sucrose-loaded large unilamellar vesicles (SLVs) was measured as described previously (10Taneva S.G. Patty P.J. Frisken B.J. Cornell R.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 9382-9393Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 26Johnson J.E. Goulding R.E. Ding Z. Partovi A. Anthony K.V. Beaulieu N. Tazmini G. Cornell R.B. Kay R.J. Biochem. J. 2007; 406: 223-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Briefly multilamellar vesicles containing trace amounts of 1,2-[3H]dipalmitoyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine were prepared in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 170 mm sucrose, 10 mm DTT; extruded through two 100-nm polycarbonate filters; diluted 5-fold in 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm DTT; and sedimented by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 30 min. CCT dimers (∼0.3 μm) were equilibrated with the SLVs for 20 min at room temperature, and the vesicle-bound protein was separated from free protein by centrifugation at 25 °C as above. In the same experiment a protein sample in the absence of added SLVs was treated similarly to determine the vesicle-independent protein sedimentation. The quantity of CCT in the supernatant and pellet was determined by SDS-PAGE using a Tricine gel system (27Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal.

K-Ras4B (K-Ras), the Ras isoform most often mutated in human cancers, is the only Ras isoform where a polybasic motif contributes essential electrostatic interactions with the negatively charged cytoplasmic leaflet. Here we studied the effects of the cationic amphiphilic drug chlorpromazine (CPZ) on the membrane association of oncogenic K-Ras(G12V), cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Combining live cell microscopy, FRAP beam size analysis, and cell fractionation studies, we show that CPZ reduces the association of GFP-K-Ras(G12V) with the plasma membrane and increases its exchange between plasma membrane and cytoplasmic pools. These effects appear to depend on electrostatic interactions because the membrane association of another related protein that has a membrane-interacting polybasic cluster (Rac1(G12V)) was also affected, whereas that of H-Ras was not. The weakened association with the plasma membrane led to a higher fraction of GFP-K-Ras(G12V) in the cytoplasm and in internal membranes, accompanied by either cell cycle arrest (PANC-1 cells) or apoptosis (Rat-1 fibroblasts), the latter being in correlation with the targeting of K-Ras(G12V) to mitochondria. In accord with these results, CPZ compromised the transformed phenotype of PANC-1 cells, as indicated by inhibition of cell migration and growth in soft agar.

Ras proteins are membrane-localized molecular switches that cycle between an inactive GDP-bound and an active GTP-loaded state (1.Hancock J.F. Parton R.G. Biochem. J. 2005; 389: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Mutations at positions 12, 13, or 61 render Ras constitutively active (GTP-bound), correlating with its ability to cause cell transformation and tumorigenesis (2.Bos J.L.

Recent evidence suggests that the signaling and biological functions of different Ras proteins are non-redundant (reviewed in Refs. 4.Voice J.K. Klemke R.L. Le A. Jackson J.H. J. Biol.

A plausible mechanism that could give rise to some of these differences is the distinct membrane anchorage of each Ras isoform, mediated by their variable C termini, termed “the hypervariable regions.” These regions also regulate intracellular trafficking, endomembrane targeting, and microdomain association of Ras isoforms (7.Rocks O.

They share a conserved C-terminal CAAX motif that undergoes farnesylation (16.Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1738) Google Scholar). However, a second signal is required; the hypervariable regions of H-Ras, N-Ras, and K-Ras4A contain one or two cysteines that undergo palmitoylation, whereas in K-Ras4B (designated K-Ras hereafter) the second signal is a 6-lysine polybasic motif that interacts electrostatically with negatively charged phospholipids in the internal membrane leaflet (15.Laude A.J.

Recently, phosphorylation of residues in the immediate vicinity of the polylysine stretch (Ser181, and to a lesser degree Ser171 and Thr183), was shown to modulate electrostatic-based interactions of K-Ras with the plasma membrane (13.Bivona T.G.

Membrane association of Ras proteins is crucial for their signaling and transforming activities (17.Hancock J.F. Paterson H. Marshall C.J. Cell. 1990; 63: 133-139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar); thus, the Ras farnesyl group has been targeted therapeutically (22.Basso A.D. Kirschmeier P. Bishop W.R. J.

Among Ras proteins, K-Ras has the highest incidence of constitutively active mutations in human tumors (e.g. pancreatic, colorectal, and lung tumors) (2.Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar, 24.Friday B.B. Adjei A.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1756: 127-144PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, specific interference with its signaling via perturbation of its unique electrostatic interactions with the membrane holds the potential for selective intervention. Chlorpromazine (CPZ) 4The abbreviations used are: CPZ, chlorpromazine; FACS, fluorescence activated cell sorter; PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; Rf, mobile fraction; τ, apparent characteristic fluorescence recovery time; WT, wild-type; FTS, S-trans,trans-farnesylthiosalicylic acid; GFP, green fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; ROI, region of interest; PI(3,4,5)P3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate; DsRed, red fluorescent protein. is a cationic amphipathic phenothiazine employed as a neuroleptic drug in treatments of schizophrenia and terminal cancer symptom alleviation (25.Lopez-Munoz F. Alamo C. Cuenca E. Shen W.W. Clervoy P. Rubio G. Ann. Clin. Psychiatry. 2005; 17: 113-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). In cultured cells, CPZ markedly affects the form and composition of the plasma membrane. In erythrocytes, the hydrophobic part of CPZ inserts into the inner membrane leaflet, whereas its cationic portion interacts electrostatically with negatively charged phospholipids in general and phosphoinositides in particular. This alters the chemo-physical properties of the membrane, causing stomatocystosis and redistribution of phospholipids between the inner and outer leaflets (26.Schrier S.L. Zachowski A. Devaux P.F. Blood. 1992; 79: 782-786Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, CPZ inhibits calmodulin, which regulates the availability of phosphoinositides via membrane recruitment of potential sequestrators of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) such as myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS) (27.Golebiewska U.

Murray D. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 151-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). Accordingly, CPZ inhibits clathrin-mediated endocytosis (29.Sofer A. Futerman A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12117-12122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) by abrogating the PI(4,5)P2-dependent membrane recruitment of the AP2 adaptor complex. Phenothiazines were also shown to inhibit proliferation and cause apoptosis of tumor cell lines, to abrogate differentiation, and to reverse multidrug resistance (30.Ford J.M. Prozialeck W.C. Hait W.N. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 35: 105-115PubMed Google Scholar, 31.Nordenberg J. Fenig E. Landau M. Weizman R. Weizman A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 1229-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 32.Motohashi N. Kawase M. Saito S. Sakagami H. Curr. Drug Targets. 2000; 1: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In accord with its effects in vitro, CPZ has been shown to inhibit tumor growth in vivo in a number of model systems (33.Polliack A. Levij I.S. Cancer Res. 1972; 32: 1912-1915PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Fujita K. Iwase S. Ito T. Matsuyama M. Nature. 1958; 181: 54Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Here, we explored the ability of CPZ to specifically dislodge oncogenic K-Ras(G12V) from the plasma membrane. Our data demonstrate that CPZ perturbs the plasma-membrane association of GFP-tagged K-Ras(G12V) or Rac1(G12V), which have a contribution of electrostatic interactions to their membrane targeting, without affecting H-Ras. Depending on the cell type, this led to a significant increase in the level of GFP-K-Ras(G12V) in the cytoplasm and/or in specific internal membranes. Thus, in Rat-1 cells CPZ shifted part of the K-Ras(G12V) population to mitochondria and induced apoptosis, whereas in PANC-1 cells CPZ induced cell-cycle arrest and no localization to mitochondria. Importantly, in PANC-1 cells stably expressing GFP-K-Ras(G12V), CPZ inhibited cell migration and colony formation in soft agar. These results suggest distinct mechanisms for the specific interference of CPZ with K-Ras signaling and oncogenic potential, based on the perturbation of its membrane interactions.

The DsRed-Mito expression vector was from Clontech. Cell Culture and Transfections—Rat-1 and PANC-1-derived cell lines were grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2, in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4 mm glutamine, 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin), all from Biological Industries Beit Haemek. Parental cell lines (Rat-1, PANC-1) were from the American Type Culture Collection. Rat-1 cell lines stably expressing GFP-K-Ras(G12V) or GFP-H-Ras(G12V) (11.Niv H. Gutman O. Kloog Y. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar) and the PANC-1 cell line expressing GFP-K-Ras(G12V) (35.Dreissigacker U. Mueller M.S. Unger M. Siegert P. Genze F. Gierschik P. Giehl K. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 1156-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) were previously described. To generate pEGFP-HA-Rac1(G12V) or wild-type (WT) pEGFP-HA-H-Ras(WT), human HA-Rac1(G12V) (or human HA-H-Ras) were inserted into the PstI/BamHI sites of pEGFP-C3 (Clontech); PANC-1 cells stably expressing this construct were generated as described (35.Dreissigacker U. Mueller M.S. Unger M. Siegert P. Genze F. Gierschik P. Giehl K. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 1156-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Parental PANC-1 cells grown on glass coverslips were transiently transfected with YFP-K-Ras constructs (1 μg DNA) using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Drug Treatment—CPZ was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline to 25 mm, and diluted (see figure legends) in cell growth medium containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2. Water-dissolved W13 (2.86 mm) was diluted similarly. Cell Fractionation and Immunoblotting—PANC-1 or Rat-1 cells grown in 10-cm dishes were treated (or not) with 25 μm CPZ or 25 μm W13 for 4 h (or 1 h), and subjected to hypotonic lysis followed by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) to separate particulate (P) and soluble (S) fractions as described previously (36.Haklai R. Gana-Weisz M. Elad G. Paz A. Marciano D. Egozi Y. Ben-Baruch G. Kloog Y. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1306-1314Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). 50 μg of protein (P fraction) and an equal percentage (v/v) of the S fraction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described (37.Kfir S. Ehrlich M. Goldshmid A. Liu X. Kloog Y. Henis Y.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8239-8250Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Blots were probed with primary antibodies (see figure legends) followed by peroxidase-coupled secondary IgG (1:5,000, 1 h, 22 °C). Bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Biosciences) and quantified by densitometry (Quantity One, Bio-Rad). FRAP—Untreated or CPZ/W13-treated cells expressing a GFP-tagged Ras protein (see legend) were subjected to FRAP studies (37 °C, in HEPES-buffered medium, pH 7.2). An argon ion laser beam (Innova 70C, Coherent) was focused through a fluorescence microscope (Axio Imager.D1, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging) to a Gaussian spot of 0.77 ± 0.03 μm (×63 oil-immersion objective) or 1.17 ± 0.05 μm (×40 water-immersion objective), and experiments were conducted with each beam size (beam size analysis; as described in Refs. 38.Henis Y.I. Rotblat B. Kloog Y. Methods. 2006; 40: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar and 39.Illenberger D. Walliser C. Strobel J. Gutman O. Niv H. Gaidzik V. Kloog Y. Gierschik P. Henis Y.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8645-8652Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The ratio between the illuminated areas was 2.28 ± 0.17 (n = 59). After a brief measurement at monitoring intensity (488 nm, 1 microwatt), a 5-milliwatt pulse (5-10 ms) bleached 60-75% of the fluorescence in the spot, and recovery was followed by the monitoring beam. The apparent characteristic fluorescence recovery time, τ, and the mobile fraction (Rf) were extracted from the FRAP curves by nonlinear regression analysis, fitting to a lateral diffusion process (38.Henis Y.I. Rotblat B. Kloog Y. Methods. 2006; 40: 183-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Methylene Blue Assay—24 h post-plating (5000 cells/well, 96-well plates), cells were treated with CPZ (see legends), fixed with 4% formaldehyde (2 h, 22 °C), and stained with 0.5% methylene blue (15 min, 22 °C). After elution with 0.1 m HCl, absorbance (OD at 595 nm) was measured with a Spectra Fluor (Tecan) microplate reader (40.Oliver M.H. Harrison N.K. Bishop J.E. Cole P.J. Laurent G.J. J. Cell Sci. 1989; 92: 513-518Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell Cycle Analysis by Flow Cytometry—Cells grown in 10-cm dishes and treated (or not) with CPZ or W13 were harvested by trypsinization, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide. Samples were analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) flow cytometry (FACSort, BD Bioscience) using CellQuest Pro™ software. Data Acquisition for Live Cell Imaging—Images were acquired with a motorized spinning disk confocal (Yokogawa CSU-22 Confocal Head) microscope (Axiovert 200M, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging) under control of SlideBook™ (Intelligent Imaging Innovations). Images were acquired with a ×63 oil immersion objective (Plan Apochromat, NA 1.4). Three-dimensional image stacks were generated by sequential recordings along the z axis by varying the position of the piezoelectric-controlled stage. A step size of 0.4 μm was used for single time point acquisitions. Time-lapse series were acquired with 30-s intervals. For GFP and YFP excitation, samples were illuminated with a 40-milliwatt solid state 473 nm laser. For DsRed and Alexa 546 excitation, samples were illuminated with a 10-milliwatt solid state 561-nm laser. Typical exposure times were 0.5-1 s. 15-20 cells were imaged for each condition (untreated or treated with 25 μm CPZ, 1 h, 37 °C in HEPES-buffered medium with 10% fetal calf serum). Only cells that did not show gross morphological aberrations were subjected to quantification. Data Processing for Live Cell Imaging—Three-dimensional images were either analyzed without further manipulations or were restored by the NearestNeighbors deconvolution or by the Constrained Iterative (CI) deconvolution (41.Agard D.A. Hiraoka Y. Shaw P. Sedat J.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1989; 30: 353-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) algorithms of SlideBook™. Fluorescence intensities of GFP- or YFP-Ras in either the entirety of the cell or the cell interior were measured both in deconvoluted (supplemental Fig. S1B) or non-deconvoluted (supplemental Fig. S1A) images by a three step procedure: (i) definition of a region of interest (ROI) through intensity-based segmentation, leading to recognition of the entire GFP/YFP-Ras population of the cell (supplemental Fig. S1C); (ii) replication of this ROI and “frame by frame” deselection of regions identified as the cell interior; (iii) subtraction of the second ROI from the first, generating a region of interest spanning the entire interior of the cell (supplemental Fig. S1D). Internal GFP/YFP-Ras was calculated as the ratio between the fluorescence intensities of the cell interior ROI divided by the total cell ROI. 15-20 cells were measured for each condition. To ensure maximal clarity and consistency of presentation and quantification, both the images and bar graph of Fig. 2 depict images deconvoluted by the NearestNeighbors algorithm (Slidebook). The increase in internal GFP-K-Ras(G12V) following treatment with 25 μm CPZ yielded analogous results when calculated from non-deconvoluted images or from images deconvoluted by the Constrained Iterative algorithm (Slidebook). Apoptosis Assays—Apoptosis was measured on cells treated (or not) with CPZ (see legend to Fig. 4) by two independent methods. In the first, negatively charged phospholipids appearing at the outer cell surface early in the apoptotic process were labeled with Annexin V-biotin (1 μg/ml, 4 °C, 45 min) followed by Cy3-streptavidin (0.5 μg/ml, 4 °C, 45 min) in HEPES-buffered Hank's balanced salt solution/HEPES supplemented with 2% bovine serum albumin. After fixation (4% paraformaldehyde, 45 min, 22 °C), fluorescent images were acquired with a spot RT CCD camera (Diagnostic Instruments) coupled to an Olympus IX70 microscope using a ×40 air objective. The second method was based on detection of caspase 3 activation. Cells grown in 6-well plates were treated (or not) with CPZ (see legend to Fig. 4). They were lysed in RIPA buffer as described (42.Bendetz-Nezer S. Seger R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25114-25122Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting (37.Kfir S. Ehrlich M. Goldshmid A. Liu X. Kloog Y. Henis Y.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8239-8250Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Blots were probed with anti-active caspase 3 (1:500, 12 h, 4 °C) and peroxidase goat anti-mouse IgG (1:5000, 1 h, 22 °C). The bands were visualized by ECL and quantified as described above. Blots were acid-stripped (37.Kfir S. Ehrlich M. Goldshmid A. Liu X. Kloog Y. Henis Y.I. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 8239-8250Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and reprobed with mouse anti-actin (1:1,000). CPZ Dislodges K-Ras but Not H-Ras from the Plasma Membrane—At neutral pH, CPZ is an amphiphilic cation, whose association with the internal plasma membrane leaflet may counter negatively charged phospholipids. Because the membrane association of K-Ras partially depends on electrostatic interactions, we employed a Rat-1 cell line stably expressing GFP-K-Ras(G12V) (43.Niv H. Gutman O. Henis Y.I. Kloog Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1606-1613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) to investigate the effects of CPZ on the distribution of K-Ras(G12V) between cytosolic and membrane fractions. Cellular fractionation studies (Fig. 1, A and D) show that CPZ (25 μm) induced a significant (2-fold) reduction of GFP-K-Ras(G12V) in the particulate (P) membrane fraction, accompanied by an increase in the cytoplasmic (S) fraction. CPZ also effectively reduced the membrane fraction of endogenous Ras in Rat-1 GFP-K-Ras(G12V) cells or in parental Rat-1 cells (52 ± 0.07% reduction in P; Fig. 1A), albeit with no detectable increase in the cytosolic fraction, possibly due to limited assay sensitivity. To test whether the interference by CPZ with the membrane interactions of K-Ras is specific to this Ras isoform, we employed cellular fractionation studies on Rat-1 cells stably expressing GFP-H-Ras(G12V) (previously characterized in Ref. 11.Niv H. Gutman O. Kloog Y. Henis Y.I. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 865-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar): no effect was observed on the membrane association of GFP-H-Ras(G12V) (Fig. 1, B and D). Furthermore, because CPZ is also a calmodulin inhibitor (31.Nordenberg J. Fenig E. Landau M. Weizman R. Weizman A. Biochem.

As shown in Fig. 1 (B and D), W13 (25 μm) did not induce a significant reduction in the membrane-associated fraction of GFP-K-Ras(G12V), suggesting that if calmodulin inhibition is involved in the effect elicited by CPZ, its effect is relatively minor. Activating mutations in K-Ras are often important in pancreatic tumors, and the tumorigenic phenotype of PANC-1 cells (a human pancreatic tumor cell line that naturally harbors constitutively active K-Ras) depends on the expression level of oncogenic K-Ras (35.Dreissigacker U.

We therefore examined the effects of CPZ on the membrane association of GFP-K-Ras(G12V) in a PANC-1-derived cell line that stably expresses this protein (35.Dreissigacker U. Mueller M.S. Unger M. Siegert P. Genze F. Gierschik P. Giehl K. Cell. Signal. 2006; 18: 1156-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In these cells, GFP-K-Ras(G12V) was mainly in the membrane fraction, but the relatively crude fractionation experiments were not sensitive enough to detect CPZ-mediated alterations in its membrane association (data not shown). However, this does not necessarily imply that CPZ fails to dislodge K-Ras from the plasma membrane in PANC-1 cells, because recent studies have shown that depending on the cellular and the biological context, various treatments can shift activated K-Ras from the plasma membrane to intracellular membrane compartments (13.Bivona T.G.

Meyer T. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 429-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). This could leave GFP-K-Ras(G12V) in the membrane fraction even if it were dislodged from the plasma membrane. To explore this possibility, we employed immunofluorescent live confocal microscopy (Fig. 2). PANC-1 GFP-K-Ras(G12V) cells were left untreated or incubated with 25 μm CPZ for 1 h (37 °C). Typical z stacks (narrow rectangles on top and left) and median planes (central square panels) of cells before and after CPZ treatment are depicted in Fig. 2A, along with a quantification (derived from multiple independent measurements) of the relative increase in intracellular localized GFP-K-Ras(G12V) (Fig. 2). CPZ shifted GFP-K-Ras(G12V) from the plasma membrane to intracellular compartments (∼90% increase; Fig. 2). To examine whether the association with the plasma membrane of other GTPases harboring lysines in their membrane targeting region is also sensitive to CPZ, we examined the effect of the drug on the cellular distribution of GFP-Rac1(G12V) stably expressed in PANC-1 cells. Indeed, Fig. 2 (A and B) demonstrates a CPZ-mediated shift of GFP-Rac1(G12V) from the plasma membrane to the cell interior. It was recently shown that reducing the overall electrostatic charge at the C terminus of K-Ras by protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation of Ser181 leads to its relocalization to endomembranes (13.Bivona T.G. Quatela S.E. Bodemann B.O. Ahearn I.M. Soskis M.J. Mor A. Miura J. Wiener H.H. Wright L. Saba S.G. Yim D. Fein A. Perez de Castro I. Li C. Thompson C.B. Cox A.D. Philips M.R. Mol.

Indeed, the phosphomimetic mutant YFP-K-Ras(G12V,S181E) showed significant intracellular localization in PANC-1 cells even without CPZ (Fig. 2). To test whether the CPZ effect on K-Ras(G12V) depends on phosphorylation of Ser/Thr in the K-Ras hypervariable region (Ser171, Ser181, and Thr183, see Ref. 13.Bivona T.G. Quatela S.E. Bodemann B.O. Ahearn I.M. Soskis M.J. Mor A. Miura J. Wiener H.H. Wright L. Saba S.G. Yim D. Fein A. Perez de Castro I. Li C. Thompson C.B. Cox A.D. Philips M.R. Mol.

Although this mutant is non-phosphorylatable at these residues, it was effectively relocated intracellularly by CPZ. This supports the notion that phosphorylation in the K-Ras hypervariable region is dispensable for the CPZ-mediated effect. In accord with the fractionation studies in Rat-1 fibroblasts (Fig. 1, B and D), the cellular distribution of G"

Loss of VLCFA synthesis via deletion of ELO3 reduced telomere length, and reconstitution of the expression of wild type ELO3, and not by its mutant with decreased catalytic activity, rescued telomere attrition. Further experiments revealed that alterations of phytoceramide seem to be dispensable for telomere shortening in response to loss of ELO3. Interestingly, telomere shortening in elo3Δ cells was almost completely prevented by deletion of IPK2 or KCS1, which are involved in the generation of inositol phosphates (IP4, IP5, and inositol pyrophosphates). Deletion of IPK1, which generates IP6, however, did not affect regulation of telomere length. Further data also suggested that elo3Δ cells exhibit accelerated chronologic aging, and reduced replicative life span compared with wild type cells, and deletion of KCS1 helped recover these biological defects. Importantly, to determine downstream mechanisms, epistasis experiments were performed, and data indicated that ELO3 and YKU70/80 share a common pathway for the regulation of telomere length. More specifically, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed that the telomere binding and protective function of YKu80p in vivo was reduced in elo3Δ cells, whereas its non-homologues end-joining function was not altered. Deletion of KCS1 in elo3Δ cells recovered the telomere binding and protective function of Ku, consistent with the role of KCS1 mutation in the rescue of telomere length attrition. Thus, these findings provide initial evidence of a possible link between Elo3-dependent VLCFA synthesis, and IP metabolism by KCS1 and IPK2 in the regulation of telomeres, which play important physiological roles in the control of senescence and aging, via a mechanism involving alterations of the telomere-binding/protection function of Ku.

Telomeres are multifunctional genetic elements that cap eukaryotic chromosome ends, and they play essential roles in genomic stability, oncogenic transformation, and cellular senescence/aging (14Zakian V.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 15Bertuch A.A. Lundblad V. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Telomeres are maintained by a specialized RNA-dependent DNA polymerase, telomerase, which adds species-specific, long-tandem nucleotide repeats (TG-repeats in yeast) to the ends of chromosomes (16Blackburn E.H. Greider C.W. Szostak J.W. Nat. Med. 2006; 12: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar). Telomeres are regulated by factors that either play a role in their protection, such as Est1/2, Tel1, Yku70/80, and Rad50, or in their rapid shortening, such as Cdc13, Rif2, and Rap1 (14Zakian V.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 141-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 15Bertuch A.A. Lundblad V. Curr. Opin.

The balance between these positive and negative factors determines the maintenance of telomeres in cells. Therefore, uncovering factors and signaling pathways involved in the regulation of telomeres is very important for senescence- and aging-related research. Interestingly, in a recent study, in which the global analysis of the roles of all non-essential genes involved in the regulation of telomere length in yeast were examined, the deletion of ELO3 was identified as one of the mutations that results in a significant telomere shortening (20Askree S.H. Yehuda T. Smolikov S. Gurevich R. Hawk J. Coker C. Krauskopf A. Kupiec M. McEachern M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8658-8663Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). However, mechanisms by which Elo3p and VLCFA synthesis regulate telomeres are still unknown. Therefore, in this study, roles and mechanisms of telomere length regulation by VLCFA synthesis via Elo3p in yeast were examined. Consistent with the previous report (20Askree S.H. Yehuda T. Smolikov S. Gurevich R. Hawk J. Coker C. Krauskopf A. Kupiec M. McEachern M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8658-8663Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), our data also showed that deletion of ELO3, which resulted in the loss of VLCFA and C26-phytoceramide synthesis, mediated a rapid attrition of telomere length. Further experiments suggested a novel link between C26-FA synthesis by Elo3p, and inositol polyphosphate (IP) metabolism by Ipk2p and Kcs1p in the regulation of telomere length. Remarkably, the deletion of IPK2 or KCS1, which are involved in the synthesis of IP4, IP5, and PP-IP4, and not IPK1, which generates IP6, completely protected telomere attrition in elo3Δ cells. In addition, data also suggested that telomere length attrition in elo3Δ cells was concomitant with accelerated chronologic aging and reduced replicative life span, biological defects that were also recovered by the deletion of KCS1. In addition, epistasis experiments revealed that ELO3 and YKU70/80 share a common pathway for the regulation of telomere length. More specifically, deletion of ELO3 resulted in alterations of the binding and protection of telomeres by Ku70/80, whereas the non-homologue end-joining (NHEJ) function of Ku was not affected. Importantly, deletion of KCS1 in the elo3Δ strain also recovered the telomere binding and protective function of YKu70/80, consistent with the protection of telomere length shortening in these cells. Thus, these data provide initial evidence for a possible link between VLCFA synthesis by Elo3p, and IP metabolism by Ipk2p/Kcs1p in the regulation of telomeres, which are involved in the control of senescence and life span, via alterations of the telomere-binding/protective functions of Ku70/80. Strains, Media, and Genetic Methods—Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Yeast cells were grown at 30 °C in rich (YPD or YPG) or minimal media containing 2% glucose (D) or galactose (G). The elo3::URA3 strains were generated by the one-step gene replacement method (21Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar). The URA3 gene was amplified using 60- and 61-base oligonucleotides consisting of 40-base 5′ or 3′ flanking sequences of the ELO3 gene followed by 20- or 21-base URA3 sequences (5′-ATT CGG CTT TTT TCC GTT TGT TTA CGA AAC ATA AAC AGT CAG CTT TTC AAT TCA ATT CAT C-3′, and 5′-TTT TCT TTT TCA TTC GCT GTC AAA AAT TCT CGC TTC CTA TGG GTA ATA ACT GAT ATA ATT-3′). Yeast cells were transformed with purified PCR products, and Ura+ cells were selected on minimal media lacking uracil. Desired deletion was confirmed by PCR of genomic DNA. The plasmid (designated as pGal-Elo3[wt] in this report) containing the ELO3 gene under the control of the GAL1 promoter, YCpGALELO3(U), was obtained from Dr. Charles E. Martin (Rutgers University, Piscataway, NJ). The pGal-Elo3(mut) containing a 24-bp deletion (corresponding to an 8-amino acid deletion at position 19–26) was generated using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene).TABLE 1Yeast strainsStrainGenotypeSourceBY4742MATΔ his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 lys2Δ0 ura3Δ0InvitrogenBY4742 elo1ΔBY4742 elo1::kanMX4InvitrogenBY4742 elo2ΔBY4742 elo2::kanMX4InvitrogenBY4742 elo3ΔBY4742 elo3::kanMX4InvitrogenBY4742 elo3Δ/pGal-ELO3 (wt)BY4742 elo3::kanMX4/pGal-ELO3(wt)::URA3This studyBY4742 elo3Δ/pGal-ELO3 (mut)BY4742 elo3::kanMX4/pGal-ELO3(mut)::URA3This studyBY4742 ipk1ΔBY4742 ipk1::kanMX4InvitrogenBY4742 ipk2ΔBY4742 ipk2::kanMX4InvitrogenBY4742 kcs1ΔBY4742 kcs1::kanMX4InvitrogenBY4742 yku70Δelo3ΔBY4742 yku70::kanMX4 elo3::URA3This studyBY4742 yku80Δelo3ΔBY4742 yku80::kanMX4 elo3::URA3This studyBY4742 ipk1Δelo3ΔBY4742 ipk1::kanMX4 elo3::URA3This studyBY4742 ipk2Δelo3ΔBY4742 ipk2::kanMX4 elo3::URA3This studyBY4742/yKU80-GFPBY4742 yKU80-GFP::HIS3This studyBY4742 elo3Δ/yKU80-GFPBY4742 elo3::URA3 yKU80-GFP::HIS3This studyBY4742 kcs1Δelo3Δ/yKU80-GFPBY4742 kcs1::kanMX4 elo3::URA3 yKU80-GFP::HIS3This studyJK9-3d elo3ΔJK9-3d elo3::URA3This studyJK9-3d lag1ΔJK9-3d lag1::kanMX4Guillas et al.

After digestion with XhoI, DNA fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% Tris/borate/EDTA/agarose gel, and transferred to a nylon membrane (Roche). Then, the membranes were probed with a digoxigenin-labeled C1–3A/TG1–3 yeast-specific telomere probe. The bands present at the bottom of the membranes represent telomere fragments resulting from digestion of the last Y′ elements at chromosome termini. The average telomere length for each lane was estimated by plotting the peak of signal intensity of the Y′ telomeres at the bottom of the blots against the position of the molecular weight markers. FA Measurements—Total lipids were extracted from the logarithmic phase of yeast cultures, and FA levels were measured using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) as described previously (23Alderson N.L.

FA contents were normalized to total lipid phosphate (Pi) levels. Measurement of Phytoceramide Levels—The measurement of the levels of endogenous phytoceramides was performed using high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, as described previously (24Bielawski J. Szulc Z.M. Hannun Y.A. Bielawska A. Methods. 2006; 39: 82-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). Phytoceramide contents were normalized to total lipid phosphate (Pi) levels. Measurement of Inositol Phosphates—The levels of IP molecules after labeling with [3H]inositol were analyzed using HPLC as described previously (25Saiardi A. Sciambi C. McCaffery J.M. Wendland B.

Determination of Chronological Aging—Chronologic aging of yeast population was determined as previously described (26Fabrizio P. Longo V.D. Methods Mol. Biol. 2007; 371: 89-95Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Yeast cultures were grown for 4–5 days until they reach a stationary phase in 10 ml of YPD media. Then, the cells were washed twice, and an equal number of cells were re-suspended in 10 ml of sterile distilled water, and their growth was monitored on YPD plates after serial dilutions. Analysis of Replicative Life Span in Yeast—The replicative life span was analyzed as described previously (27Kim S. Benguria A. Lai C.Y. Jazwinski S.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3125-3136Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). In summary, new buds (virgin cells) from overnight cultures were deposited in a row in isolated spots on an YPD plate. The number of buds removed by micro-dissection prior to cell death is defined as the life span of the cell in generations. The significance of the differences in the life spans of aging cohorts of each of the strains in these experiments was assessed using the Mann-Whitney test. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Analysis—The association of endogenous YKu80p-GFP, which was constructed by insertion of a 2.1-kb GFP fragment containing a histidine marker into the 3′-end of YKU80 by homologous recombination, with telomeric DNA in WT and elo3Δ strains were assessed by ChIP analysis as previously described (28Wooten-Blanks L.G. Song P. Senkal C.E. Ogretmen B. FASEB J. 2007; 21: 3386-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After endogenous proteins were cross-linked to DNA by 1% formaldehyde for 1 h, YKu80p-GFP was immunoprecipitated using anti-GFP microbeads (MACS). Then, the cross-links were reversed with 200 mm NaCl, and precipitated DNA bound to Ku was spotted on nylon membranes. Telomeres were detected using a digoxigenin-labeled telomere probe as described above. Deletion of ELO3, Which Results in the Loss of VLCFA Synthesis, Mediates Telomere Shortening—In addition to their structural roles in biological membranes, lipid molecules are known to transduce a myriad of signaling pathways involved in the regulation of a wide variety of biological processes, such as regulation of cell growth, proliferation, and/or senescence (11Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Sci. Aging Knowledge Environ. 2003; 2003: PE27Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Recently, global analysis of the roles of all non-essential genes in the regulation of telomeres in yeast revealed that loss of ELO3 results in a significant reduction in telomere length (20Askree S.H.

However, mechanisms by which ELO3 and/or VLCFA synthesis regulate telomere length have not been determined previously. Given our interest in the roles of lipid/sphingolipid metabolism and signaling in the regulation of telomeres, we set out experiments to determine mechanisms involved in the regulation of telomeres by VLCFA synthesis, which is also an integral part of sphingolipid metabolism, via the function of Elo3 in yeast. First, to further confirm the possible roles of Elo3-generated VLCFA containing 26 carbon units (Fig. 1A) in the regulation of telomeres, we examined the FA contents and telomere length in elo3Δ compared with WT, elo1Δ, and elo2Δ strains, using GC/MS and Southern blotting, respectively. Consistent with previous reports (2Oh C.S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17376-17384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 3Kohlwein S.D.

A moderate decrease in the levels of C24- and C26-, and an increase in C16–22-FAs were observed in elo2Δ cells, and no significant changes were detected in VLCFA contents in elo1Δ when compared with the WT strain (Fig. 1B and Table 2).TABLE 22-OH fatty acid levels (nmol/nmol of Pi)2-OH C162-OH C182-OH C202-OH C222-OH C242-OH C26WT32.24 ± 5.603.68 ± 0.290.4 ± 0.071.07 ± 0.188.86 ± 1.9853.81 ± 5.67elo1Δ29.67 ± 4.882.81 ± 0.411 ± 0.151.71 ± 0.215.19 ± 0.7549.6 ± 3.1elo2Δ65.37 ± 8.4111.01 ± 1.8712.3 ± 1.223.10 ± 0.283.6 ± 0.4318.23 ± 2.11elo3Δ90.52 ± 9.018.6 ± 1.5414.7 ± 1.3916.92 ± 1.725.92 ± 0.69UD Open table in a new tab More importantly, the data also showed that deletion of ELO3 (Fig. 1C, lane 4) decreased telomere length about 100 (+12) bp, whereas deletion of ELO1 or ELO2 (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 3, respectively) did not cause detectable effects when compared with the WT strain (Fig. 1C, lanes 1 and 5). Similar data were also observed in another strain (JK9–3d), in which the deletion of ELO3 decreased telomere length ∼110 bp compared with the WT strain (shown in Fig. 4C). These data are consistent with the previous study (20Askree S.H. Yehuda T. Smolikov S. Gurevich R. Hawk J. Coker C. Krauskopf A. Kupiec M. McEachern M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 8658-8663Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), and suggest that alterations of the VLCFA synthesis by the deletion of ELO3 participate in a rapid reduction of telomere length. Overexpression of WT ELO3 Reconstitutes the Synthesis of VLCFA, Leading to the Prevention of Telomere Attrition in the elo3Δ Mutant Strain—Next, to examine whether the shortening of telomeres in elo3Δ cells can be reversed, VLCFA synthesis was reconstituted in these mutants using an expression vector containing WT ELO3 under the control of a galactose (GAL)-inducible promoter (2Oh C.S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17376-17384Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). Expression of ELO3 in the presence of GAL reconstituted the synthesis of C26-FA within 24, 48, or 72 h of induction (Fig. 2A and Table 3), and more importantly, induction of Elo3p expression markedly reversed the shortening of telomere length in elo3Δ/pGAL1-ELO3(wt) cells at these time points compared with that of uninduced or WT cells (Fig. 2B, lanes 2, 4, and 6; 3, 5, and 7; and 1, respectively). Collectively, these data suggest that deletion of ELO3 results in the reduction of telomere length, which can be recovered in response to reconstitution of WT ELO3 expression and the synthesis of VLCFA in elo3Δ cells.TABLE 32-OH fatty acid levels (nmol/nmol of Pi)24 h48 h72 hC22C24C26C22C24C26C22C24C26WT1.07 ± 0.28.86 ± 3.353.81 ± 11.21.08 ± 0.249.0 ± 3.4550.1 ± 10.21.0 ± 0.258.9 ± 2.951.2 ± 10.9Uninduced18.10 ± 3.45.76 ± 3.41.11 ± 0.235.3 ± 12.312.12 ± 2.50.99 ± 0.228.2 ± 9.89.18 ± 2.61.21 ± 0.2Induced9.11 ± 2.332.09 ± 7.623.19 ± 5.27.15 ± 2.838.63 ± 8.341.85 ± 6.86.67 ± 1.819.27 ± 0.936.79 ± 13.1 Open table in a new tab Then, to determine the functional role of Elo3p activity in the regulation of telomere length at 72 h, a mutant form of ELO3, which is defective in generation of C26-FA, was expressed in elo3Δ mutants, and its effects on FA synthesis and telomere length were examined. Because the domains that are required for distinct catalytic functions of Elo1–3p are still unclear, we truncated a stretch of amino acids (LNSSSSCF) at positions 19–26 near the N terminus of Elo3p, which is present only in yeast Elo3, but not present in Elo1p or Elo2p. The mutant form of Elo3p was then expressed in elo3Δ cells under control of the GAL promoter, and its effects on FA synthesis and on the recovery of telomere length attrition were determined. Interestingly, the data showed that expression of the mutant Elo3p, lacking amino acids 19–26, was unable to generate C26 FA as efficiently, whose activity was about 70% less than that of the WT Elo3 (Fig. 3A and Table 4). In addition, the results also showed that C22- and C24-FA levels were comparable in response to the expression of WT or mutant Elo3p (Fig. 3A and Table 4). Moreover, whereas the expression of WT-ELO3 recovered loss of telomeres of about 70%, expression of the mutated-Elo3p did not efficiently protect telomeres in elo3Δ cells (Fig. 3, B and C, lanes 3 and 4). Taken together, these data suggest that enzymatic activity of Elo3p for C26-FA synthesis, and not in the alterations of C22- or C24-FA synthesis, plays important roles in the regulation of telomere length in yeast.TABLE 42-OH fatty acid levels (nmol/nmol of Pi)2-OH C162-OH C182-OH C202-OH C222-OH C242-OH C26elo3Δ+pGalElo3(wt)38.75 ± 4.974.11 ± 0.821.8 ± 0.278.13 ± 1.912.1 ± 0.1831.64 ± 4.7elo3Δ+pGalelo3(mut)51.44 ± 6.433.8 ± 0.794.2 ± 0.816.93 ± 1.333.96 ± 0.419.92 ± 1.43 Open table in a new tab Alterations of the Phytoceramide Generation Might Be Dispensable for the Shortening of Telomere Length in elo3Δ Cells—In yeast, hydroxy-C26-phytoceramide, containing the VLCFA chain, constitutes the majority of ceramides, therefore, the synthesis of VLCFA is directly involved in the regulation of phytoceramide generation (Fig. 4A). In fact, the loss of VLCFA synthesis is known to result in significant changes in sphingolipid metabolism (2Oh C.S. Toke D.A. Mandala S. Martin C.E. J. Biol.

Indeed, as shown in Fig. 4B and Table 5, C22-phytoceramide was highly elevated, whereas C26-phytoceramide, both 2-hydroxylated and non-hydroxylated forms (data not shown), was almost completely lost in elo3Δ cells. Therefore, we investigated whether alterations in ceramide generation were involved in telomere shortening in elo3Δ cells.

F. G. (1992) J. Biol. Chem. 267, 6027–6035). In this study, we investigated whether a recombinant human chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase-1 (C6ST-1) catalyzes the sulfation of C6 on both galactose residues in the linkage region using structurally defined acceptor substrates. The C6ST-1 was expressed as a soluble protein A chimeric form in COS-1 cells and purified using IgG-Sepharose. The purified C6ST-1 utilized the linkage tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexasaccharide-serines and hexasaccharide alditols, including GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate)β1–4GlcUAβ1–3Gal(4-O-sulfate)β1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser and ΔGlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate)β1–4GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Gal(6-O-sulfate)β1–4Xyl-ol. Identification of the reaction products obtained with the linkage tetra-, penta-, and hexasaccharide-serines revealed that the C6ST-1 catalyzed the sulfation of C6 on both galactose residues in the linkage region. Notably, the linkage tetrasaccharide-peptide GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-(Gly)Ser-(Gly-Glu) was a good acceptor substrate for the C6ST-1, suggesting that the sulfation of the galactose residues can occur before the transfer of the first N-acetylhexosamine residue to the linkage tetrasaccharide. In contrast, no incorporation was observed into ΔGlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate)β1–4GlcUAβ1–3Gal(4-O-sulfate)β1–3Galβ1–4Xyl-ol, indicating that an intact xylose is necessary for the transfer of a sulfate to the second sugar residue Gal from the reducing end. These findings clearly demonstrated that the recombinant C6ST-1 catalyzes the sulfation of C6 on both galactose residues in the linkage region in vitro.

Heparin/heparan sulfate is synthesized once GlcNAc is transferred to the common linkage region, whereas chondroitin sulfate is formed if GalNAc is first added. Therefore, the first hexosamine transfer is critical in determining whether heparin/heparan sulfate or chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chains are selectively assembled on the common linkage region (for reviews, see Refs. 1Sugahara K.

We have been investigating the structure of the linkage region of various GAGs to search for possible structural differences, which may determine the characteristics of the GAG species to be synthesized. These structural studies revealed that sulfation of C6 on both Gal residues and C4 of Gal adjacent to GlcUA was characteristic of chondroitin sulfate (3Sugahara K.

Sulfation of C4 of the Gal residue was also demonstrated in the linkage region of bovine aorta dermatan sulfate (8Sugahara K. Ohkita Y. Shibata Y. Yoshida K. Ikegami A. J. Biol.

Sulfated Gal residues have not been found to date in the linkage region of heparin or heparan sulfate (9Sugahara K. Yamada S. Yoshida K. de Waard P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. J. Biol.

Thus, the possibility exists that the sulfated Gal structures contribute to the segregation of chondroitin/dermatan sulfate and heparin/heparan sulfate in relation to the sorting mechanisms in the biosynthesis of different GAGs. Although a considerable amount of information is available concerning the sulfation profile of the Gal residues in the linkage region, no sulfotransferase responsible for the sulfation of the Gal residues has yet been identified. cDNA encoding chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase-1 (C6ST-1), one of the sulfotransferases involved in the biosynthesis of GAGs, which catalyzes the transfer of sulfate from PAPS to position 6 of the GalNAc residue, has been cloned from chicken, mouse, and human (11Fukuta M.

These findings prompted us to investigate whether C6ST-1 catalyzes the sulfation of C6 on both Gal residues in the linkage region using structurally defined acceptor substrates. To carry out this analysis, we took advantage of the fact that the soluble form of the human C6ST-1 cDNA had successfully been expressed, and the purified recombinant enzyme was well characterized (14Tsutsumi K.

All other reagents and chemicals were of the highest quality. Expression of the Soluble Form of the Human C6ST and Enzyme Assay—Construction of the soluble form of the human C6ST-1 fused with the cleavable insulin signal sequence and the protein A IgG-binding domain was carried out as described (14Tsutsumi K. Shimakawa H. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The expression plasmid (11 μg) was transfected into COS-1 cells on 100-mm plates using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. Two days after transfection, 1 ml of the culture medium (∼0.5 μg of protein) was collected and incubated with 10 μl of IgG-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads recovered by centrifugation were washed with and then resuspended in the assay buffer and tested for sulfotransferase activity using various linkage oligosaccharides (1 nmol each) as sulfate acceptor substrates and [35S]PAPS as a sulfate donor as described (14Tsutsumi K.

Characterization of the Reaction Products—The reaction products were isolated by gel filtration on a column of Superdex 30 (1.6 × 60 cm) equilibrated with 0.25 m NH4HCO3, 7% 1-propanol. The radioactive peak containing the product was pooled and evaporated dry. The isolated products were digested for 1 h at 37 °C with 20 mIU of chondroitinase AC-II in a total volume of 30 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.0. The digest was analyzed by anion exchange HPLC on an amine-bound silica PA03 column (YMC Co., Kyoto, Japan) as described (18Sugahara K. Okumura Y. Yamashina I. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

To identify the disaccharide and the linkage tetrasaccharide-serine or alditol, the chondroitinase AC-II digest was co-chromatographed with five unsaturated standard disaccharides and two structurally defined tetrasaccharide-serines isolated from shark and whale cartilage (4Sugahara K.

Sulfation of C6 on Both Gal Residues in the GAG-Protein Linkage Region—To facilitate the functional analysis of the human C6ST-1, a soluble form of the protein was generated by replacing the first 48 amino acids of the C6ST-1 with a cleavable insulin signal sequence and a protein A IgG-binding domain as described (14Tsutsumi K. Shimakawa H. Kitagawa H. Sugahara K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and then the soluble C6ST-1 was expressed in COS-1 cells as a recombinant enzyme fused with the protein A IgG-binding domain. The fused enzyme expressed in the medium was absorbed on IgG-Sepharose beads to eliminate endogenous C6ST-1, and then the enzyme-bound beads corresponding to ∼0.5 μg of protein were used as an enzyme source. The bound fusion protein was assayed for sulfotransferase activity using the nonsulfated linkage penta- and hexasaccharide-serines as sulfate acceptors and [35S]PAPS as a sulfate donor. The reaction products were isolated by gel filtration on a column of Superdex 30, digested by chondroitinase AC-II, and then analyzed by anion exchange HPLC as shown in Fig. 1, A and B. The digests of the products obtained with the pentasaccharide-serine (GalNAc-GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-Ser) as an acceptor substrate showed three radioactive peaks at the elution positions of free GalNAc(6-O-sulfate), ΔHexUA-Gal-Gal(6-O-sulfate)-Xyl-Ser, and ΔHexUA-Gal(6-O-sulfate)-Gal(6-O-sulfate)-Xyl-Ser in a ratio of 10:4:1, respectively (Fig. 1A). In addition, the digests of the products obtained with the hexasaccharide-serine (GlcUA-GalNAc-GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-Ser) as an acceptor substrate showed three radioactive peaks at the elution positions of ΔHexUA-Gal-Gal(6-O-sulfate)-Xyl-Ser, GlcUA-GalNAc(6-O-sulfate), and ΔHexUA-Gal(6-O-sulfate)-Gal(6-O-sulfate)-Xyl-Ser in a ratio of 5:2:1, respectively (Fig. 1B). These results indicate that the recombinant C6ST-1 can catalyze the transfer of a sulfate group from PAPS to both Gal residues in the GAG-protein linkage region of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans in vitro. It should be noted that no authentic ΔHexUA-Gal(6-O-sulfate)-Gal-Xyl-Ser is available, and therefore it could not be discriminated from ΔHexUA-Gal-Gal(6-O-sulfate)-Xyl-Ser by the present method. Substrate Specificity of the Recombinant C6ST-1 toward a Variety of Structurally Defined Linkage Oligosaccharides—To further characterize the substrate specificity of the recombinant C6ST-1, a variety of structurally defined linkage oligosaccharides (Table 1) were tested as acceptor substrates. They consisted of tri-, tetra-, penta-, and hexasaccharide-serines and a tetrasaccharide-peptide, all of which were chemically synthesized, as well as various tetra- and hexasaccharides in the forms of alditols and glycoserines, which were isolated from chondroitin sulfate and heparin. These results obtained at a fixed substrate concentration of 20 μm are summarized in Table 1.TABLE 1Sulfotransferase activities of the recombinant C6ST-1 toward oligosaccharides isolated from the GAG-protein linkage region of chondroitin sulfate and heparin and the putative reaction productsAcceptor (putative reaction product)Relative rate (%)Gal-Ga-Xyl-Ser4(Gal(6S)-Gal(6S)Xyl-Ser)GlcUA-Gal-Ga-Xyl-Ser8(GlcUA-Gal(6S-Gal(6S)Xyl-Ser)GlcUA-Gal(4S)-Ga-Xyl-Ser20(GlcUA-Gal(4S-Gal(6S)Xyl-Ser)GlcUA-Gal-GalXyl-(Gly)Ser-Gly-Glu)100(GlcUA-Gal(6S)Gal(6S)-Xyl-(Gly)Ser-(ly-Glu))ΔHexUA-Gal-Ga-Xyl-Ser24(ΔHexUA-Ga(6S)-Gal(6S)Xyl-Ser)GalNAc-GlUA-Gal-Ga-Xyl-Ser84(GalNAc(6S-GlcUA-Gal6S)-Gal(6S)Xyl-Ser)GlcNAc-GlUA-Gal-Ga-Xyl-Ser2(GlcNAcGlcUA-Gal6S)-Gal(6S)Xyl-Ser)GlcUA-GalNAc-GlUA-Gal-Ga-Xyl-Ser130(GlcUA-GalNA(6S)-GlcUA-Gal6S)-Gal(6S)Xyl-Ser)GlcUA-GaNAc(4S)-GlcU-Gal(4S)-Ga-Xyl-Ser250(GlcUA-GalNA(4S)-GlcUA-Gal4S)-Gal(6S)Xyl-Ser)ΔHexUA-GaNAc(4S)-GlcUAGal(4S)-Ga-Xyl-Ser270(ΔHexUA-GalNAc4S)-GlcUA-Gal4S)-Gal(6S)Xyl-Ser)ΔHexUA-GlNAc(4S)-GlcU-Gal(4S)-Gl-Xyl-ol0ΔHexUAGalNAc(4S)-GlUA-Gal-Ga-Xyl-Ser260(ΔHexUA-GalNAc4S)-GlcUA-Gal6S)-Gal(6S)Xyl-Ser)ΔHexUA-GlNAc(6S)-GlcU-Gal-Gal-Xl(2P)-ol290(ΔHexUA-GalNA(6S)-GlcUA-Ga(6S)-Gal-Xy(2P)-ol)ΔHexUA-GlNAc(6S)-GlcU-Gal-Gal(6)-Xyl-ol360(ΔHexUA-GalNc(6S)-GlcUA-Ga(6S)-Gal(6S-Xyl-ol)ΔHexUAGlcNAc(6S)-GlUA-Gal-GalXyl-Ser17(ΔHexUA-GalNAc6S)-GlcUA-Gal(S)-Gal(6S)Xyl-Ser) Open table in a new tab The purified human C6ST-1 utilized the linkage tri- and tetrasaccharide-serines (Gal-Gal-Xyl-Ser and GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-Ser) as well as penta- and hexasaccharide-serines (Gal-NAc-GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-Ser and GlcUA-GalNAc-GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-Ser). To confirm that the C6ST-1 catalyzed the sulfation of C6 on both Gal residues in the tetrasaccharide-serine, the reaction products obtained with ΔHexUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-Ser as an acceptor were analyzed by HPLC, as shown in Fig. 1C. The products showed two radioactive peaks at the elution positions of ΔHexUA-Gal-Gal(6-O-sulfate)-Xyl-Ser and ΔHexUA-Gal(6-O-sulfate)-Gal(6-O-sulfate)-Xyl-Ser in a ratio of 4:1, respectively. These results suggest that the sulfation of the Gal residues can occur before the transfer of the first N-acetylhexosamine residue to the linkage tetrasaccharide. In addition, the tetrasaccharide-peptide showed stronger acceptor activity than the corresponding tetrasaccharide-serine, indicating that the acidic peptide had a positive influence. Notably, GlcUAβ1–3Gal(4-O-sulfate)β1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser and GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate)β1–4GlcUAβ1–3Gal(4-O-sulfate)β1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser were also utilized as acceptor substrates, implying that the C6ST-1 can form the disulfated linkage structure, GlcUAβ1–3Gal(4-O-sulfate)β1–3Gal(6-O-sulfate)β1–4Xyl, previously found in shark cartilage chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (7de Waard P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Harada T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6036-6043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Besides, ΔHexUAα1–3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate)β1–4GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1-3Gal(6-O-sulfate)β1–4Xyl-ol was also utilized as an acceptor substrate, whereas no incorporation of sulfate was observed into ΔHexUAα1–3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate)β1–4GlcUAβ1–3Gal(4-O-sulfate)β1–3Galβ1–4Xyl-ol. These results suggest that the intact xylose residue is necessary for the transfer of a sulfate group to the second sugar residue Gal from the reducing end. Hence, when a phosphorylated hexasaccharide alditol ΔHexUAα1–3GalNAc(6-O-sulfate)β1–4GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl(2-O-phosphate)-ol was used as an acceptor, it acted as an acceptor (Table 1), and the Gal residue substituted by a GlcUA residue was most likely sulfated. Although linkage region structures that contain both 6-O-sulfated Gal and 2-O-phosphorylated Xyl residues have never been demonstrated in natural chondroitin sulfate chains, the results indicate that the recombinant C6ST-1 can transfer a sulfate at least to the Gal residue substituted by a GlcUA residue in the linkage region with the 2-O-phosphorylated Xyl residue. In addition, as shown in Table 1, sulfated compounds, GlcUA-Gal(4S)-Gal-Xyl-Ser and GlcUA-GalNAc(4S)-GlcUA-Gal(4S)-Gal-Xyl-Ser, were better substrates than the corresponding nonsulfated compounds, GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-Ser and GlcUA-GalNAc-GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-Ser, respectively. Thus, the prior sulfation of the acceptor substrates enhances the acceptor activity. The GlcNAc-containing pentasaccharide-serine GlcNAcα1–4GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser showed a little activity, indicating that sulfation of the Gal residue(s) in the linkage region could take place at least in vitro even after the synthesis of the repeating disaccharide region was initiated toward heparan sulfate biosynthesis. Low yet significant 35S incorporation was also observed when ΔHexUAα1–4GlcNAc(6-O-sulfate)α1–4GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser derived from the linkage region of porcine intestinal heparin was used as an acceptor. Although sulfated Gal residues have not been demonstrated in the linkage region isolated from heparin or heparan sulfate, these results indicate that the recombinant C6ST-1 is capable of transferring sulfate at least in vitro to the linkage region of heparin or heparan sulfate that already contains the first GlcNAc residue despite the low efficiency. Effects of Acceptor Concentrations on the Recombinant C6ST-1 Activity—To investigate the effect of the concentration of an acceptor substrate, the C6ST-1 activity was determined using various concentrations of a synthetic disulfated hexasaccharide-serine, GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate)β1–4GlcUAβ1–3Gal(4-O-sulfate)β1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser, which can accept only one sulfate group by the C6ST-1. As shown in Fig. 2, the apparent Km value for the hexasaccharide-serine was 50 μm. In this paper, we clearly demonstrated that the recombinant human C6ST-1 catalyzes the sulfation of C6 on both Gal residues in the linkage region in vitro. This is the first identification of the sulfotransferase responsible for the sulfation of Gal residues in the GAG-protein linkage region. To date, three distinct sulfation patterns of 6-O-sulfated Gal residue(s) in the linkage region, GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Gal(6-O-sulfate)β1–4Xyl, GlcUAβ1–3Gal(6-O-sulfate)β1–3Gal(6-O-sulfate)β1–4Xyl, and GlcUAβ1–3Gal(4-O-sulfate)β1–3Gal(6-O-sulfate)β1–4Xyl, have been found in chondroitin sulfates from various sources, including whale cartilage (4Sugahara K. Masuda M. Harada T. Yamashina I. de Waard P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), shark cartilage (6Sugahara K. Ohi Y.

Chem. 1992; 267: 6036-6043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and rat chondrosarcoma (3Sugahara K. Yamashina I. de Waard P. van Halbeek H. Vliegenthart J.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10168-10174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The present findings indicate that the recombinant human C6ST-1 can synthesize all of these three structures. In addition, since the Km value of C6ST-1 for the disulfated hexasaccharide-serine, GlcUAβ1–3GalNAc(4-O-sulfate)β1–4GlcUAβ1–3Gal(4-O-sulfate)β1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser, was low (50 μm), as revealed in this study, it is most likely that C6ST-1 catalyzes the sulfation of C6 on Gal residues in the linkage region in vivo as well. Moreover, ΔHexUA-GalNAc(4S)-GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-Ser, which is a good acceptor substrate for the C6ST-1, did not serve as acceptor at all for the other chondroitin 6-O-sulfotransferase, C6ST-2 (19Kitagawa H. Fujita M. Ito N. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21075-21080Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) (data not shown). Although we cannot rule out the existence of other sulfotransferase(s) responsible for the sulfation of Gal residues in the GAG-protein linkage region, C6ST-1 seems to be mainly responsible for the sulfation of Gal residues, since mouse and human C6ST-1 genes are widely expressed in many tissues (12Uchimura K. Kadomatsu K. Fan Q.-W. Muramatsu H. Kurosawa N. Kaname T. Yamamura K. Fukuta M. Habuchi O. Muramatsu T. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 489-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 13Fukuta M. Kobayashi Y. Uchimura K. Kimata K. Habuchi O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1399: 57-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although the biological significance of the sulfation of the linkage region is as yet unknown, the sulfated residues may play important roles in the biosynthesis of GAGs (e.g. by contributing to the segregation of galactosaminoglycans (chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate) and glucosaminoglycans (heparin and heparan sulfate) or as a marker for the intracellular transport of chondroitin sulfate chains to the Golgi compartment for biosynthetic processing or elongation and maturation of the repeating disaccharide units of chondroitin sulfate chains, since sulfated Gal residues have not been demonstrated in the linkage region isolated from heparin or heparan sulfate). On the basis of the present finding that the recombinant human C6ST-1 utilized the linkage tri- and tetrasaccharide-serines, it is possible that the sulfation of the Gal residues occurs before the transfer of the first N-acetylhexosamine residue to the linkage tetrasaccharide. In addition, the tetrasaccharide-peptide showed greater acceptor activity than the corresponding tetrasaccharide-serine, indicating that the peptide portion is recognized by C6ST-1 with a positive influence and that the Gal residues are sulfated much more efficiently when the linkage region is bound to the core protein as a naturally occurring nascent proteoglycan. Moreover, it should be noted that C6ST-1 activity was found in medial and trans-Golgi fractions and that glucuronyltransferase I involved in the biosynthesis of the GAG-protein linkage region had a dual Golgi distribution similar to that of chondroitin-polymerizing glucuronyltransferase II in both medial and trans-Golgi/trans-Golgi networks and distinct from the distribution of galactosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of the GAG-protein linkage region, which were found exclusively in cis-Golgi fractions (20Sugumaran G. Katsman M. Silbert J.E. Biochem. J. 1998; 329: 203-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It is possible, therefore, that the sulfation of the linkage region might occur before the transfer of the first N-acetylhexosamine residue to the linkage tetrasaccharide and could be a signal for differential assembly of chondroitin versus heparan chains on nascent proteoglycans as previously proposed (3Sugahara K. Yamashina I. de Waard P. van Halbeek H. Vliegenthart J.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 10168-10174Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7de Waard P. Vliegenthart J.F.G. Harada T. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6036-6043Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we recently demonstrated that sulfation of the Gal residues can significantly influence the catalytic activity of glucuronyltransferase I (21Tone Y. Pedersen L.C. Yamamoto T. Izumikawa T. Kitagawa H. Nishihara J. Tamura J. Negishi M. Sugahara K. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 16801-16807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Enzyme assays showed that the synthetic compounds, Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xyl(2-O-phosphate)β1-O-Ser, Galβ1–3Gal(6-O-sulfate)β1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser, and Galβ1–3Gal(6-O-sulfate)β1–4Xyl(2-O-phosphate)β1-O-Ser, served as better substrates for the truncated form of the recombinant human glucuronyltransferase I than the unmodified trisaccharide serine, suggesting that both the 6-O-sulfate group on Gal(I) and the 2-O-phosphate group on Xyl enhance the acceptor activity. The results indicate the possible involvement of these modifications in the processing and maturation of the growing linkage region oligosaccharide required for the assembly of GAG chains. The 2-O-phosphorylation of the Xyl residue has been reported to influence the synthesis of the linkage region by promoting the transfer of GlcUA to the Gal residue (22Moses J. Oldberg A. Fransson L.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 260: 879-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Considering that various penta- and hexasaccharide-serines were efficiently utilized as acceptor substrates for C6ST-1, sulfation of the Gal residue(s) in the linkage region can occur even after the nascent proteoglycan has already been directed to the specific site for GAG polymerization and sulfation. In addition, the present study demonstrated that sulfated compounds, GlcUA-Gal(4S)-Gal-Xyl-Ser and GlcUA-GalNAc(4S)-GlcUA-Gal(4S)-Gal-Xyl-Ser, were better substrates than the corresponding nonsulfated compounds, GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-Ser and GlcUA-GalNAc-GlcUA-Gal-Gal-Xyl-Ser, respectively (Table 1). Thus, the prior sulfation of the acceptor substrates has significant influence upon further sulfation of the linkage region. Moreover, the sulfated linkage region may also contain signals that influence the subsequent polymerization and sulfation of the repeating disaccharide region. In fact, sulfation in the vicinity of the linkage region is reported to have a powerful influence upon chain elongation reactions (23Kitagawa H. Tsutsumi K. Ujikawa M. Goto F. Tamura J. Neumann K.W. Ogawa T. Sugahara K. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 531-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, the GlcNAc-containing penta- and hexasaccharide-serines, GlcNAcα1–4GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser and ΔHexUAα1–4GlcNAc(6-O-sulfate)α1–4GlcUAβ1–3Galβ1–3Galβ1–4Xylβ1-O-Ser, served as acceptors for C6ST-1 despite the low efficiency, implying that sulfation of the Gal residue(s) in the linkage region could take place at least in vitro even after the synthesis of the repeating disaccharide region for initiation of heparan sulfate biosynthesis. In view of the fact that sulfated Gal residues have not been demonstrated for the linkage region isolated from heparin or heparan sulfate, it is possible that C6ST-1 interacts with the core protein and that the core protein portion of the nascent heparin/heparan sulfate proteoglycan has inhibitory effects on C6ST-1 activity. In fact, since the tetrasaccharide-peptide showed greater acceptor activity than the corresponding tetrasaccharide-serine, as described above, C6ST-1 obviously recognizes the peptide portion. In the future, if various tetrasaccharide-peptides with the specific amino acid sequence found only in heparin/heparan sulfate proteoglycans become available, it is of importance to determine how C6ST-1 interacts with the specific residues in the core protein. Chondroitin sulfate has recently been implicated in various intriguing biological phenomena, such as the regulation of growth factor functions (24Deepa S.S. Umehara Y. Higashiyama S. Itoh N.

To further address the biological significance of the sulfation of the linkage region, it is necessary to examine in detail the structure of the GAGs in the affected tissues of the patients and how the type and/or the sulfation profiles of the GAGs to be synthesized are influenced by C6ST-1 expression using C6ST-1 cDNA-transfected cells, which originally synthesize chondroitin 4-sulfate as a major component, such as Chinese hamster ovary cells or rat chondrosarcoma cells.

https://openalex.org/W2055100675,"alpha-Macroglobulins (alphaMs) are large glycoproteins that have been identified in a wide range of vertebrate and invertebrate species and are mostly thiol ester containing proteinase inhibitors. A recent analysis of bacterial genomes ( Budd, A., Blandin, S., Levashina, E. A., and Gibson, T. J. (2004) Genome Biol. 5, R38 ) identified many alpha-macroglobulin-like sequences that appear to have been acquired by Gram-negative bacteria from their metazoan hosts. We report the first expression and characterization of such a bacterial alpha-macroglobulin, that from Escherichia coli. This is also the first alpha-macroglobulin to be characterized that is predicted to be membrane-anchored. We found that the 183-kDa protein contains an intact thiol ester, is monomeric, and is localized to the periplasmic space. Reaction with proteinase results in limited cleavage within a bait region, rapid activation of the thiol ester, cross-linking to the attacking proteinase or other available nucleophiles, and partial protection of the proteinase against macromolecular substrates. Given these properties and the co-occurrence of the alphaM gene with one for a repair transglycosylase, this suggests a possible role for bacterial alphaMs in cell defense following host attack. Such a role would make bacterial alphaMs appropriate novel targets for antibiotic drugs."
https://openalex.org/W2061122140,"Misregulation of REL, a nuclear factor-κB family transcription factor, has been implicated in several human lymphoid malignancies. REL has a conserved N-terminal DNA-binding/dimerization domain called the Rel homology domain (RHD) and a C-terminal transactivation domain (TAD). Here, we define the sequences (amino acids (aa) 323–422) between the RHD and TAD as a REL inhibitory domain (RID) because deletion of these sequences increases both REL transactivation and DNA binding. Furthermore, we have characterized two REL mRNA splice variants that encode proteins with alterations near RID: one lacking exon 9 sequences (aa 308–330; RELΔ9) and one with an exonized Alu fragment insertion of 32 aa after aa 307 (REL+Alu). Deletion of RID or exon 9-encoded sequences increases transactivation by GAL4–REL by approximately threefold. Moreover, deletion of RID or exon 9 sequences increases transactivation by full-length REL from certain κB site-containing promoters and increases DNA binding by REL. Deletion of RID does not affect REL's ability to transform chicken spleen cells. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of mRNA from both primary lymphoma samples and several transformed tissue culture cell lines indicates that the RELΔ9 splice variant is preferentially expressed in lymphoma, suggesting that the REL transcript lacking exon 9 could serve as a marker for certain types of lymphoid tumors."
https://openalex.org/W2061725521,"We reported previously that a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, MyoGEF, localizes to the central spindle, activates RhoA, and is required for cytokinesis. In this study, we have found that Plk1 (polo-like kinase 1) can phosphorylate MyoGEF, thereby recruiting MyoGEF to the central spindle as well as enhancing MyoGEF activity toward RhoA. The in vitro kinase assay shows that Plk1 can phosphorylate MyoGEF on threonine 574. Immunoprecipitation/immunoblot analysis demonstrates that mutation of threonine 574 to alanine dramatically decreases threonine phosphorylation of MyoGEF in transfected HeLa cells, suggesting that threonine 574 is phosphorylated in vivo. Consistent with these observations, immunofluorescence shows that Plk1 and MyoGEF colocalize at the spindle pole and central spindle during mitosis and cytokinesis. Importantly, RNA interference-mediated depletion of Plk1 interferes with the localization of MyoGEF at the spindle pole and central spindle. Moreover, mutation of threonine 574 to alanine in MyoGEF or depletion of Plk1 by RNA interference leads to a decrease in MyoGEF activity toward RhoA in HeLa cells. Therefore, our results suggest that Plk1 can regulate MyoGEF activity and localization, contributing to the regulation of cytokinesis.

Therefore, our results suggest that Plk1 can regulate MyoGEF activity and localization, contributing to the regulation of cytokinesis. Plk1 (polo-like kinase 1) belongs to a class of serine/threonine kinases, and they have attracted increasing attention because of their critical roles in the regulation of mitosis and cytokinesis. Four mammalian Plk family members, i.e. Plk1, Plk2/SNK, Plk3/FNK/PRK, and Plk4/SAK, have been identified (1Barr F.A. Sillje H.H. Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Plk1 is the best characterized member of the human Plk family. It localizes to the centrosomes and kinetochores in late S or early G2 and then translocates to the spindle pole and central spindle during mitosis and cytokinesis (1Barr F.A. Sillje H.H. Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Consistent with its intracellular distribution, Plk1 regulates multiple events during cell cycle progression, such as centrosome amplification and maturation, mitotic exit, mitotic spindle assembly, spindle pole maintenance, and cytokinesis (2Sumara I.

Preisinger C. Sutcliffe J. Kopajtich R. Nigg E.A. Mayer T.U. Barr F.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 863-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Further studies demonstrate that Plk1 is responsible for recruiting ECT2 to the central spindle, where ECT2 locally activates the small GTPase protein RhoA at the cleavage furrow. In turn, RhoA induces myosin contractile ring assembly as well as furrow formation and ingression (9Petronczki M. Glotzer M. Kraut N. Peters J.M. Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 713-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar, 10Burkard M.E. Randall C.L. Larochelle S. Zhang C. Shokat K.M. Fisher R.P. Jallepalli P.V. Proc. Natl.

In cells treated with the small molecule inhibitor for Plk1, ECT2 does not interact with MgcRacGAP (HsCyk-4) and fails to localize to the central spindle, suggesting that Plk1 inhibitor prevents the localization of ECT2 to the central spindle by interfering with ECT2-MgcRacGAP interaction (9Petronczki M. Glotzer M. Kraut N. Peters J.M. Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 713-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). However, depletion of ECT2 does not completely abrogate equatorial RhoA activation during cytokinesis (20Birkenfeld J. Nalbant P. Bohl B.P. Pertz O. Hahn K.M. Bokoch G.M. Dev. Cell. 2007; 12: 699-712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar), suggesting that other GEFs may also contribute to RhoA activation at the cleavage furrow. We reported previously that MyoGEF, a guanine nucleotide factor, localizes to the spindle pole and central spindle (21Wu D. Asiedu M. Adelstein R.S. Wei Q. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 1234-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In this study, we demonstrate that Plk1 can phosphorylate MyoGEF on Thr-574. Plk1 and MyoGEF colocalize to the spindle pole and central spindle. We further show that phosphorylation of MyoGEF by Plk1 not only promotes the recruitment of MyoGEF to the central spindle but also enhances MyoGEF activity toward RhoA. Therefore, our results strongly suggest that Plk1 can regulate MyoGEF activity and localization, contributing to the regulation of cytokinesis. Plasmid Constructs—Myc-tagged MyoGEF and GFP-tagged MyoGEF were described previously (21Wu D. Asiedu M. Adelstein R.S. Wei Q. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 1234-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Six MyoGEF truncation mutants corresponding to amino acids 71–388, 71–565, 392–565, 392–780, 559–790, and 479–780 were cloned into pCMV-3Tag2B (Stratagene) and pGEX-5X-1 (GE Healthcare) expression vectors. MyoGEF mutants (T574A, T574E, T585A, and T620A) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis according to the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene) and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Cell Culture and Synchronization—HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cell cycle synchronization was performed by double thymidine block. Briefly, the transfected HeLa cells were treated with 2 mm thymidine for 24 h, cultured in thymidine-free medium for 10 h, and then treated with 2 mm thymidine for 16 h, followed by “release” to progress through the cell cycle in thymidine-free medium for the indicated time periods. Transfection of plasmids or siRNA into HeLa cells were done by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For transfection with plasmids, the transfected cells were analyzed ∼24 h after transfection. For transfection with siRNA or siRNA plus plasmids, the transfected cells were analyzed ∼48–72 h after transfection. The siRNA sequence for human Plk1 is as follows: AAGGGCGGCTTTGCCAAGTGCTT (6Liu X. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8672-8676Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Plk1 siRNA was purchased from Dharmacon. Plk1 inhibitor GW 843682X was purchased from Tocris Biosciences. Expression and Purification of GST Fusion Proteins—GST-fused MyoGEF polypeptides were expressed in a bacterial expression system. BL21 bacterial cells expressing GST-MyoGEF polypeptides were homogenized by sonication and lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100 for 1 h at 4 °C. The GST fusion proteins were purified by using glutathione-conjugated agarose beads, eluted with 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mm glutathione, and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl. Immunoprecipitation—Immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays were carried out as described previously (21Wu D. Asiedu M. Adelstein R.S. Wei Q. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 1234-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 22Wei Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 37790-37797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 2.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm NaF) for 10 min on ice. Cell extracts were collected and precleared with protein A/G-agarose beads. The precleared lysate was incubated with agarose-conjugated anti-Myc antibody overnight at 4 °C. After washing three times with radioimmune precipitation assay lysis buffer, the bound proteins were eluted with SDS loading buffer. Immunoblotting—Cell lysates or immunoprecipitates were separated by 7% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to an Immobilon-P transfer membrane (Millipore), blocked in 5% nonfat milk, and incubated with primary antibodies as indicated. The following primary antibodies were used: mouse anti-Myc (9E10, 1:1000; Santa Cruz), mouse anti-Plk1 (1:1000; Invitrogen), rabbit anti-phosphohistone 3 (1:1000; Millipore), rabbit anti-phosphothreonine (1:500; Invitrogen), rabbit anti-GFP (1:1000; Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-β-tubulin (1:2000; Santa Cruz), and rabbit anti-MyoGEF (1:250) (21Wu D. Asiedu M. Adelstein R.S. Wei Q. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 1234-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The blots were washed and incubated with horseradish peroxide-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:5000; Santa Cruz) for 1 h at 23°C. The blots were visualized by SuperSignal West Pico Luminol/Enhancer solution (Pierce). Immunofluorescence Staining and Time Lapse Microscopy—HeLa cells grown on coverslips were fixed in methanol/acetone (1:1; for anti-MyoGEF) for 12 min at -20 °C or in 4% paraformaldehyde for 12 min at 23 °C. After blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 23 °C, the transfected cells were incubated with primary antibodies as indicated for 3 h at 23°C or overnight at 4 °C, followed by incubation with secondary antibodies for 40 min at 23 °C. The primary antibodies used for immunofluorescence were as follows: monoclonal anti-β-tubulin antibody (Sigma; 1:1000), rabbit polyclonal MyoGEF antibody (1:100), and mouse anti-Plk1 (1:100; Invitrogen). The secondary antibodies, rhodomine goat anti-mouse IgG (1:500) and rhodomine goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:500), were purchased from Invitrogen. The nuclei were visualized by DAPI (Sigma). The coverslips were mounted using a Prolong antifade kit (Invitrogen). The images were collected by using a Leica DMI 6000 B microscope (Leica) and were then processed by deconvolution. For time lapse microscopy, the cells grown in coverglass chambers were transfected with plasmids or siRNA as indicated. The transfected cells were cultured in Leibovitz's L-15 medium (ATCC) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Images of the live transfected cells were taken every 20 s using a Leica DMI 6000 B microscope (Leica). In Vitro Kinase Assays—For Plk1 in vitro kinase assay, 5 μg of purified GST-fused MyoGEF fragments were incubated with 0.5 μg of recombinant His-Plk1 (Cell Signaling) in kinase buffer (5 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 2.5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm EGTA, 4 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mm dithiothreitol, 250 μm ATP) and 1 μCi of [γ32]-ATP. For the Cdk1 kinase assay, 5 μg of GST-fused MyoGEF fragments were incubated with 0.5 μg of purified GST-fused recombinant Cdk1/cyclinB complex (Cell Signaling) in kinase buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 200 μm ATP) and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in 50 μl and resolved on SDS-PAGE gels. The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography. Dephosphorylation—Myc-MyoGEF immunoprecipitates were washed twice with complete lysis buffer, twice with lysis buffer without phosphatase inhibitors, and finally once with the lambda phosphatase reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.01% Brij35). The immunoprecipitates were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C in the presence or absence of 1 μl of lambda phosphatase (Biolabs), washed twice with lysis buffer containing phosphatase inhibitors to stop the reaction, and then used in a GEF exchange assay. In Vitro Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Analysis—The GEF exchange assay was conducted using a fluorescence-based spectroscopic analysis, which measured the incorporation of a fluorescence analog of GTP, N-methylanthraniloyl (mant)-GTP onto small GTPase RhoA. Briefly, lysates from HeLa cells expressing Myc-MyoGEF or Myc-MyoGEFT574A or from HeLa cells transfected with Plk1 siRNA and a plasmid encoding Myc-MyoGEF were immunoprecipitated using anti-Myc antibody-conjugated agarose and washed four times with lysis buffer. 10 μg of GST-tagged RhoA were equilibrated in exchange buffer containing 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 400 nm mant-GTP (Invitrogen). After taking a few measurements of steady readings at 25 °C using a Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences Victor 3, the Myc-MyoGEF or IgG immunoprecipitates were added, and the relative fluorescence of mant-GTP (excitation λ, 360 nm; emission λ, 440 nm) was monitored. Rhotekin Pull-down Assay—The Rhotekin pull-down assay was carried out as described previously (21Wu D. Asiedu M. Adelstein R.S. Wei Q. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 1234-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar).

Analysis of the MyoGEF amino acid sequence revealed that there are at least seven potential Plk1 phosphorylation sites. To determine whether Plk1 can phosphorylate MyoGEF, three GST-tagged MyoGEF fragments 71–388, 71–565, and 392–780 were used in an in vitro kinase assay with purified recombinant Plk1. Among these overlapping MyoGEF polypeptides, only GST-392–780 fragment was phosphorylated by Plk1 in vitro (Fig. 1B, lane 8), indicating that the Plk1 phosphorylation sites are located between amino acids 565 and 780 (Fig. 1, A and B). Further analysis of the MyoGEF amino acid sequence revealed that Plk1 could most likely phosphorylate MyoGEF on Thr-574 based on the Plk1 consensus phosphorylation site (24Elia A.E. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Science. 2003; 299: 1228-1231Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar, 25Elia A.E. Rellos P. Haire L.F. Chao J.W. Ivins F.J. Hoepker K. Mohammad D. Cantley L.C. Smerdon S.J. Yaffe M.B. Cell. 2003; 115: 83-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). To confirm this prediction, we mutated Thr-574 to alanine in the 392–780 fragment and used it as a substrate for the Plk1 in vitro kinase assay. A point mutation of threonine 574 to alanine (T574A) abolished the phosphorylation of 392–780 fragment by Plk1 in vitro (Fig. 1B, compare lane 6 with lane 8). These results strongly suggest that Thr-574 can be phosphorylated by Plk1 in vitro. To determine whether Plk1 could phosphorylate Thr-574 in vivo, we transfected plasmids encoding Myc-MyoGEF wild type (WT) or Myc-MyoGEF-T574A into HeLa cells. The immunoprecipitated Myc-MyoGEF-WT and Myc-MyoGEF-T574A were subjected to immunoblot analysis with an antibody specific for phosphorylated threonine (Thr(P)). Fig. 1C shows that Myc-MyoGEF-WT (Myc-WT) was threonine-phosphorylated (lane 1). In contrast, mutation of Thr-574 to alanine (T574A) dramatically decreased threonine phosphorylation (Fig. 1C, compare lane 1 with lane 2). We also mutated two other potential threonine phosphorylation sites (Thr-585 and Thr-620) to alanines (Myc-T585A and Myc-T620A). The immunoprecipitated Myc-T585A and Myc-T620A were also subjected to immunoblot analysis with Thr(P) antibody. Mutation of Thr-585 and Thr-620 to alanines did not affect threonine phosphorylation of MyoGEF (Fig. 1C, compare lanes 3 and 4 with lane 1). These results show that MyoGEF is phosphorylated on Thr-574 in vivo. To determine whether the phosphorylation is sensitive to Plk1 depletion, we transfected HeLa cells with a plasmid encoding Myc-MyoGEF and control siRNA or Plk1 siRNA. 48 h after transfection, the transfected cells were subjected to immunoprecipitation with normal IgG or with anti-Myc antibody. The resulting immunoprecipitates were then subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies specific for Thr(P) and MyoGEF. As shown in Fig. 1D, depletion of Plk1 dramatically decreased threonine-phosphorylation of MyoGEF (compare lane 2 with lane 4 in the upper panel). Thr-574 Is Specifically Phosphorylated in Mitosis—Plk1 is a mitotic kinase that mainly functions during mitosis and cytokinesis (9Petronczki M. Glotzer M. Kraut N. Peters J.M. Dev.

MyoGEF localizes to the cleavage furrow and plays a role in regulating cytokinesis (21Wu D. Asiedu M. Adelstein R.S. Wei Q. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 1234-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). One would expect that MyoGEF is likely to be phosphorylated by Plk1 specifically during mitosis and cytokinesis. To test this idea, we transfected HeLa cells with plasmids encoding Myc-MyoGEF-WT (Fig. 2A, top two panels) or Myc-MyoGEF-T574A (Fig. 2A, middle two panels). The transfected cells were synchronized at mitosis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Immunoblot analysis was carried out with an antibody specific for phosphohistone 3 to confirm that the transfected cells were enriched in mitosis at 10–14 h following release from double thymidine block (Fig. 2A, bottom two panels). The immunoprecipitated Myc-MyoGEF-WT or Myc-MyoGEF-T574A was subjected to immunoblot analysis with Thr(P) antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A, Myc-WT was mainly phosphorylated at ∼10–14 h following release from double thymidine block (lanes 5–7, top two panels). In contrast, replacement of threonine 574 with a nonphosphorylatable alanine dramatically decreased in vivo phosphorylation of transfected MyoGEF (Fig. 2A, middle two panels). These finding suggests that MyoGEF is preferentially phosphorylated during mitosis. To further confirm that MyoGEF is phosphorylated by Plk1, we transfected HeLa cells with a plasmid encoding Myc-MyoGEF and control siRNA or Plk1 siRNA. The transfected cells were subjected to double thymidine block as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Because MyoGEF was phosphorylated at 12 h following release from thymidine block (Fig. 2A), we selected this time point to assess whether treatment with Plk1 siRNA had an effect on threonine phosphorylation of MyoGEF. Approximately 62 h after siRNA transfection (at 12 h following release from thymidine block), Myc-MyoGEF was immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc-conjugated agarose and subjected to immunoblot analysis with phosphothreonine antibody. As shown in Fig. 2B, cotransfection with Plk1 siRNA decreased threonine phosphorylation of Myc-MyoGEF (compare lane 1 with lane 2 in the upper panel). These results suggest that Plk1 can mediate threonine-phosphorylation of MyoGEF in vivo. To determine whether endogenous MyoGEF could be phosphorylated by Plk1, we transfected U2OS cells with control siRNA or Plk1 siRNA. The transfected cells were collected at mitosis as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As shown in Fig. 2D, depletion of Plk1 by RNAi dramatically decreased threonine phosphorylation of endogenous MyoGEF (compare lane 1 with lane 2 in the top panel). Fig. 2C shows that MyoGEF antibody could immunoprecipitate endogenous MyoGEF from U2OS cells. We selected U2OS cells for this experiment, because this cell line expresses a higher level of MyoGEF than HeLa cells (21Wu D. Asiedu M. Adelstein R.S. Wei Q. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 1234-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Consistent with the above observations, Myc-Plk1 was coimmunoprecipitated with GFP-MyoGEF from transfected HeLa cells (Fig. 3A, compare lane 1 with lane 2 in the top panel). We also constructed expressing plasmids that contain several overlapping MyoGEF fragments (Fig. 3B). These plasmids were cotransfected into HeLa cells with a plasmid encoding GFP-Plk1. Coimmunoprecipitation experiment showed that GFP-Plk1 could interact with MyoGEF fragments 71–565, 392–565, and 392–780, but not 71–388 (Fig. 3C), indicating that amino acids 388–565 of MyoGEF can interact with Plk1. Plk1 interacts with its substrates through the polo-box domain (PBD) (15Lowery D.M. Clauser K.R. Hjerrild M. Lim D. Alexander J. Kishi K. Ong S.E. Gammeltoft S. Carr S.A. Yaffe M.B.

Therefore, we asked whether PBD could bind MyoGEF. As shown in Fig. 3D, a plasmid encoding GFP-MyoGEF was cotransfected into HeLa cells with empty plasmid (lane 1) or a plasmid encoding Myc-PBD (lane 2). PBD was coimmunoprecipitated with GFP-MyoGEF (Fig. 3D, compare lane 1 with lanes 2 in the top panel), suggesting that PBD could bind MyoGEF. Depletion of Endogenous Plk1 Interferes with the Localization of MyoGEF to the Central Spindle—Consistent with its critical role in regulating cytokinesis, Plk1 localizes to the spindle pole and central spindle (1Barr F.A. Sillje H.H. Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 5: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Plk1 phosphorylated MyoGEF on Thr-574 during mitosis and cytokinesis (Fig. 2). We have also shown previously that MyoGEF localizes to the spindle pole and central spindle (21Wu D. Asiedu M. Adelstein R.S. Wei Q. Cell Cycle. 2006; 5: 1234-1239Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether MyoGEF colocalizes with Plk1 during mitosis and cytokinesis. HeLa cells were fixed with methanol/acetone and stained with antibodies specific for MyoGEF and Plk1. As shown in Fig. 4, MyoGEF colocalized with Plk1 to the centrosome/spindle pole in metaphase (arrowheads in panels a–d) and then concentrated at the central spindle in anaphase (arrows in panels e–l) and midbody in telophase (arrows in panels m–p). Plk1 and MyoGEF also colocalized to the spindle pole in anaphase (arrowheads in panels e–h), but the signals were weaker than those in metaphase (arrowheads in panels a–h; compare panels a–d with panels e–h). We further asked whether Plk1 is required for the localization of MyoGEF to the spindle pole and central spindle. It has been shown that most of the cells depleted of Plk1 by RNAi were arrested in mitosis. However, ∼15% of Plk1-depleted cells can advance to anaphase, although they do not complete cytokinesis (6Liu X. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8672-8676Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with control or Plk1 siRNA. 48 h following transfection, the transfected HeLa cells were fixed and stained with antibodies specific for Plk1 or MyoGEF. In HeLa cells depleted of Plk1, MyoGEF was not concentrated at the spindle pole and central spindle (Fig. 4A, panels q–x). Approximately 20–50 cells at each stage of mitosis and cytokinesis were analyzed, and the results were quantified in Fig. 4B. Disruption of Endogenous MyoGEF Localization by Plk1 Inhibitor—To further confirm that Plk1 activity is required for the localization of MyoGEF to the central spindle, we also examined whether Plk1 inhibitor GW 843682X affected MyoGEF localization during cytokinesis. HeLa cells were treated with GW 843682X for ∼40 min and then subjected to immunofluorescence with anti-MyoGEF antibody. As shown in Fig. 5, Plk1 inhibitor interfered with the localization of endogenous MyoGEF at the central spindle (compare panels a an"
https://openalex.org/W2047021964,"The hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) is a master regulator of the cellular response to decreased oxygen levels. This transcription factor is highly unstable at normal oxygen concentrations and is rapidly stabilized by hypoxia. At normoxia two specific proline residues (Pro(402) and Pro(563)) of mHIF-1alpha are hydroxylated and recognized by the von Hippel-Lindau E3 ubiquitin ligase (pVHL) complex, which upon binding mediates degradation of the protein. Previous studies have demonstrated that these two proline residues are critical for high affinity binding to pVHL. We have performed a detailed analysis of a mutant form of HIF-1alpha, where both these proline residues have been mutated, and we have uncovered a novel degradation pathway, to which the HIF-1alpha mutant protein is not resistant. Our results show that the HIF-1alpha double proline mutant undergoes ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation, and retains the ability to be stabilized in response to hypoxia and CoCl(2) treatment. However in contrast to the wild-type protein, stabilization of the mutant was only observed within short periods of hypoxia exposure (1-2 h). Degradation assays in the presence of the expressed prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs) 1-3 showed that, unlike the wild-type protein, the HIF-1alpha mutant was resistant to these hydroxylases. However, experiments knocking-down expression of pVHL by RNA interference showed that the HIF-1alpha mutant is degraded and ubiquitinated by a pVHL-mediated mechanism. In conclusion, we show the first evidence of a novel mechanism of degradation of HIF-1alpha at normoxia that involves pVHL but is not mediated by PHDs 1-3 or by degradation boxes surrounding Pro(402) and Pro(563)."
https://openalex.org/W1980877328,"Significant discoveries have recently contributed to our knowledge of intracellular growth factor and nutrient signaling via mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin). This signaling pathway is essential in cellular metabolism and cell survival by enhancing protein translation through phosphorylation of 4EBP-1 and p70S6K. Growth factors like insulin-like growth factor-I induce mTOR to prevent cell death during cellular stress. Agents targeting mTOR are of major interest as anticancer agents. We show here, using human breast cancer cells, that certain types of stress activate mTOR leading to 4E-BP1 and p70S6K phosphorylation. UV treatment increased phosphorylation of the translation inhibitor eIF2alpha, suggesting a potential mechanism for UV activation of Akt and mTOR. c-Myc, a survival protein regulated by cap-dependent protein translation, increased with IGF-I treatment, but this response was not inhibited by rapamycin. Additionally, UV treatment potently increased c-Myc degradation, which was reduced by co-treatment with the proteasomal inhibitor, MG-132. Together, these data suggest that protein translation does not strongly mediate cell survival in these models. In contrast, the phosphorylation status of retinoblastoma protein (pRB) was mediated by mTOR through its inhibitory effects on phosphatase activity. This effect was most notable during DNA damage and rapamycin treatment. Hypophosphorylated pRB was susceptible to inactivation by caspase-mediated cleavage, resulting in cell death. Reduction of pRB expression inhibited IGF-I survival effects. Our data support an important role of phosphatases and pRB in IGF-I/mTOR-mediated cell survival. These studies provide new directions in optimizing anticancer efficacy of mTOR inhibitors when used in combination with DNA-damaging agents."
https://openalex.org/W2071568382,"Phosphorylation of the R domain is required for cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) channel gating, and cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) simulation can also elicit insertion of CFTR into the plasma membrane from intracellular compartments (Bertrand, C. A., and Frizzell, R. A. (2003) Am. J. Physiol. 285, C1-C18). We evaluated the structural basis of regulated CFTR trafficking by determining agonist-evoked increases in plasma membrane capacitance (Cm) of Xenopus oocytes expressing CFTR deletion mutants. Expression of CFTR as a split construct that omitted the R domain (Deltaamino acids 635-834) produced a channel with elevated basal current (Im) and no DeltaIm or trafficking response (DeltaCm) upon cAMP/PKA stimulation, indicating that the structure(s) required for regulated CFTR trafficking are contained within the R domain. Additional deletions showed that removal of amino acids 817-838, a 22-amino acid conserved helical region having a net charge of -9, termed NEG2 (Xie, J., Adams, L. M., Zhao, J., Gerken, T. A., Davis, P. B., and Ma, J. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 23019-23027), produced a channel with regulated gating that lacked the agonist-induced increase in CFTR trafficking. Injection of NEG2 peptides into oocytes expressing split DeltaNEG2 CFTR prior to stimulation restored the agonist-evoked DeltaCm, consistent with the concept that this sequence mediates the regulated trafficking event. In support of this idea, DeltaNEG2 CFTR escaped from the inhibition of wild type CFTR trafficking produced by overexpression of syntaxin 1A. These observations suggest that the NEG2 region at the C terminus of the R domain allows stabilization of CFTR in a regulated intracellular compartment from which it traffics to the plasma membrane in response to cAMP/PKA stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W2017017587,"Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatase 3 (MKP3) is a cytoplasmic dual specificity phosphatase that functions to attenuate signaling via dephosphorylation and subsequent deactivation of its substrate and allosteric regulator, extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 2 (ERK2). Expression of MKP3 has been shown to be under the control of ERK2, thus providing an elegant feedback mechanism for regulating the rate and duration of proliferative signals. Previously published studies suggest that MKP3 might serve as a tumor suppressor; however, significantly elevated, rather than reduced, levels of this protein have been reported in early lesions. Because overexpression of this phosphatase is counterintuitive to a proposed tumor suppressor function, the observed cellular tolerance suggested a self-inactivation mechanism. Using surface plasmon resonance, we have provided direct evidence of physical interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains. Kinetic analysis using dimethyl sulfoxide to activate the C-terminal fragment in the absence of ERK2 showed that the isolated C-terminal domain had higher catalytic efficiency than the similarly activated full-length protein. Furthermore, when the isolated N-terminal domain was added to the activated C-terminal domain, a dose-dependant inhibition of catalytic activity was observed. The similarity between the K(I) and K(D) values obtained indicate that interdomain binding stabilizes the inactive conformation of the catalytic site and implies that the N-terminal domain functions as an allosteric inhibitor of phosphatase activity. Finally, we have provided evidence for oligomerization of MKP3 in pancreatic cancer cells expressing elevated levels of this phosphatase."
https://openalex.org/W2093462309,"The p57/coronin-1 protein is a member of the coronin family of actin-binding proteins, which are characterized by the presence of WD (tryptophan/aspartic acid) repeats and a coiled-coil motif in the molecule. It is selectively expressed in immune cells and has been suggested to play crucial roles in leukocyte functions, including cell migration and phagocytosis. In this study we examined the effects of p57/coronin-1 phosphorylation on the association of the protein with actin. Treatment of HL60 human leukemic cells or p57/coronin-1-transfected HEK293 cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) reduced the association of p57/coronin-1 with the actin cytoskeleton, as indicated by cell fractionation experiments and by fluorescence microscopic observation. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of HL60 cell lysate revealed that p57/coronin-1 was phosphorylated upon PMA stimulation of the cells, giving two major and two minor spots of phosphorylated forms, each with distinct isoelectric points. The p57/coronin-1 molecules associated with the cytoskeleton in PMA-treated HL60 cells were phosphorylated at lower levels than those recovered in the cytosolic fraction. In addition, p57/coronin-1 co-sedimented with F-actin polymerized in vitro had lower phosphorylation levels than the molecules remaining in the supernatant. By affinity chromatographic analysis using anti-p57/coronin-1 antibody-conjugated Sepharose, p57/coronin-1 derived from PMA-treated HL60 cells showed lower affinity for actin than that from untreated cells. Finally, recovery of p57/coronin-1 in the actin cytoskeleton-rich fraction from neutrophil-like differentiated HL60 cells decreased during phagocytosis, concomitant with enhanced phosphorylation of p57/coronin-1. These results strongly suggest that the phosphorylation of p57/coronin-1 down-regulates its association with actin and modulates the reorganization of actin-containing cytoskeleton.

Actin-binding proteins participate in a variety of leukocyte functions, including chemotaxis, phagocytosis, degranulation, and cellular signaling via reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Coronin is an actin-binding protein originally found in Dictyostelium discoideum (1de Hostos E.L. Bradtke B. Lottspeich F. Guggenheim R. Gerisch G.

Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 345-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). In humans, seven homologues have been identified, and collectively they constitute the coronin protein family. This family is characterized by common structural features, such as five WD (tryptophan-aspartic acid) repeats located at the center of the molecule and a coiled-coil domain at the C terminus. Each coronin member exhibits distinct tissue distribution, suggesting each has a specific function in various actin-related cellular processes in respective tissues (9Uetrecht A.C. Bear J.E. Trends Cell Biol. 2006; 16: 421-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). We previously identified p57/coronin-1 as the first mammalian coronin and found its selective expression in immune cells (10Suzuki K. Nishihata J. Arai Y. Honma N. Yamamoto K. Irimura T. Toyoshima S. FEBS Lett. 1995; 364: 283-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). We have also reported that p57/coronin-1 possesses at least two actin binding sites in the N-terminal region (11Oku T. Itoh S. Okano M. Suzuki A. Suzuki K. Nakajin S. Tsuji T. Nauseef W.M. Toyoshima S. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2003; 26: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and forms a dimeric structure via the leucine zipper motif in the C-terminal coiled-coil region (12Oku T. Itoh S. Ishii R. Suzuki K. Nauseef W.M. Toyoshima S. Tsuji T. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). These results suggest that p57/coronin-1 is involved in the regulation of the rearrangement of the actin-containing cytoskeleton through the cross-linking and bundling of filaments. Recent reports by Yan et al. (13Yan M. Di Ciano-Oliveira C. Grinstein S. Trimble W.S. J. Immunol. 2007; 178: 5769-5778Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 14Yan M. Collins R.F. Grinstein S. Trimble W.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 3077-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) indicated that p57/coronin-1 was actively involved in chemotaxis and phagosome formation in leukocytes. p57/coronin-1 accumulated at the leading edge of migrating neutrophils and in the nascent phagosome, and the introduction of a dominant-negative form or TAT fusion construct of p57/coronin-1 into leukocytes resulted in the inhibition of chemotaxis and a reduction in cell spreading, adhesion, and lamellipodial extensions. Our previous study also indicated that p57/coronin-1 and F-actin transiently accumulated in phagocytic cups and phagosomal membranes during phagocytosis in neutrophils and neutrophil-like differentiated HL60 cells (15Allen L.A. DeLeo F.R. Gallois A. Toyoshima S. Suzuki K. Nauseef W.M. Blood. 1999; 93: 3521-3530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Itoh S. Suzuki K. Nishihata J. Iwasa M. Oku T. Nakajin S. Nauseef W.M. Toyoshima S. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2002; 25: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The transient association of p57/coronin-1 with phagosomes is thought to be closely related to the fusion of phagosomes and lysosomes, because phagolysosomes form immediately after the dissociation of p57/coronin-1 from phagosomes. Ferrari et al. (17Ferrari G. Langen H. Naito M. Pieters J. Cell. 1999; 97: 435-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar) demonstrated the relevance of p57/coronin-1 to intracellular parasitism of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in murine macrophages by showing that the failure of lysosomes to fuse with phagosomes containing mycobacteria was accompanied by the prolonged accumulation of p57/coronin-1 around the phagosomes. Recently, their group also showed the involvement of p57/coronin-1 in the Ca2+-dependent signaling processes leading to phagosome-lysosome fusion upon mycobacterial infection (18Jayachandran R.

These results strongly suggest that p57/coronin-1 plays a crucial role in regulating the formation and maturation of phagosomes. We previously reported that p57/coronin-1 was phosphorylated in neutrophil-like differentiated HL60 cells concomitantly with the dissociation of p57/coronin-1 from phagosomes after the cells phagocytosed opsonized zymosan (16Itoh S.

Furthermore, the dissociation of p57/coronin-1 from F-actin surrounding phagosomes was impaired by PKC inhibitors (16Itoh S. Suzuki K. Nishihata J. Iwasa M. Oku T. Nakajin S. Nauseef W.M. Toyoshima S. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2002; 25: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). These results implicate p57/coronin-1 phosphorylation in the intracellular localization of this actin-binding protein. Thus, we postulated that the association of p57/coronin-1 with phagosomes via actin filaments is regulated by PKC-dependent phosphorylation of p57/coronin-1 during phagocytosis. In this study we present evidence that the phosphorylation of p57/coronin-1 is enhanced by a PKC activator, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and down-regulates the association of p57/coronin-1 with F-actin.

The cDNA for the truncated form of p57/coronin-1 in a pEGFP-C2 vector (pEGFP-p57LZ; amino acid residues 372–461, including a coiled-coil domain with a leucine zipper motif) was prepared as described previously (12Oku T. Itoh S. Ishii R. Suzuki K. Nauseef W.M. Toyoshima S. Tsuji T. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequences of these clones were confirmed with a DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the dye-terminator method. Cell Culture and Transfection—HL60, COS-1, and HEK293T cells were grown in RPMI1640 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) at 37 °C under humidified 5% CO2. HEK293T, COS-1, and HL60 cells with EGFP-tagged p57/coronin-1 constructs were transfected by electroporation (Gene Pulsar Xcell™, Bio-Rad) as described previously (12Oku T. Itoh S. Ishii R. Suzuki K. Nauseef W.M. Toyoshima S. Tsuji T. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Briefly, 30 μgof plasmid DNA was added to the cell suspension (3.5 × 106 cells for HEK293 and COS-1 cells in 0.7 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 5 × 106 cells in 0.2 ml of RPMI1640 medium, 10% fetal calf serum for HL60 cells). The mixture was transferred into a 0.4-cm electrode gap electroporation cuvette and subjected to a single pulse of 300 V at a capacitance of 975 microfarads. The cell suspension was then diluted with 10 ml of RPMI1640 medium, 10% fetal calf serum and cultured at 37 °C for 24–48 h. Stable transfectants of HEK293T cells were cloned by the limiting dilution. Electrophoresis and Immunoblotting—SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were conducted as described previously (12Oku T. Itoh S. Ishii R. Suzuki K. Nauseef W.M. Toyoshima S. Tsuji T. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Isolation of the Cytoskeleton-rich Fraction—The cytoskeleton-containing detergent-insoluble fraction was isolated according to the method of Gatfield et al. (19Gatfield J. Albrecht I. Zanolari B. Steinmetz M.O. Pieters J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2786-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Cell pellets (1 × 106 cells) were suspended in 0.3 ml of ice-cold cytoskeleton isolation buffer (80 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, containing 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1% Triton X-100). The suspension was immediately centrifuged at 5000 × g for 3 min to obtain the detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton-containing fraction and the detergent-soluble cytosolic fraction. The cells were treated with or without the following reagents at 37 °C for 30 min before extraction with the cytoskeleton isolation buffer: PMA (150 nm) and calyculin A (100 nm) for PKC activation, chelerythrine (30 μm) for PKC inhibition, or latrunculin B (5 μm) for inhibition of actin polymerization (for depolymerization of F-actin). Fluorescence Microscopy—The intracellular distribution of p57/coronin-1 and F-actin in HL60 cells was observed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells were treated with the cytoskeleton isolation buffer at 4 °C for 3 min, washed with PBS once, fixed with 3.8% neutral buffered formaldehyde at 4 °C for 10 min, and incubated with anti-p57/coronin-1 antibody (5 μg/ml) in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 60 min. After washing 3 times with PBS, the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (dilution 1:200) and rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (15 units/ml) in PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. The labeled cells thus prepared were washed 3 times with PBS and then mounted on a slide glass with 2.3% 1,4-diazabicycle-2,2,2-octane, 90% glycerol. COS-1 and HEK293T cells that had been transfected with plasmids containing a gene for EGFP were cultured on a Lab-Tek II Chamber Slide (Nalge Nunc, Rochester, NY) at 37 °C for 48 h. Fluorescently labeled cells were observed using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (Radiance 2100, Bio-Rad; LSM5 Exciter, Carl Zeiss MicroImaging Co., Ltd.). Fluorescence in the green and red channels was visualized with 488 nm (argon laser) and 543 nm (helium/neon laser) laser lines, respectively. Images were collected under non-saturating conditions set up by the use of an output LUT (look-up table). Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—HL60 cells (1 × 106 cells) were washed with cold PBS and incubated with 0.3 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C for 10 min. The cell lysate was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was diluted with 9 volumes of rehydrating buffer (7 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% CHAPS, 40 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% IPG buffer (pH 4–7 or 5.5–6.7), and 0.002% bromphenol blue). Immobiline™ DryStrips (7 cm, pH 4–7 or 5.3–6.5) were incubated with the diluted cell lysate and rehydrated for 12 h at 20 °C. The protein-loaded strip was then subjected to isoelectric focusing (IEF) (CoolPhoreStar IPG-IEF Type-P, Anatech, Tokyo, Japan). Isoelectric focusing was conducted under the following conditions: 500 V for 1 h, 700 V for 15 min, 1000 V for 15 min, 1500 V for 15 min, 2000 V for 15 min, 2500 V for 15 min, 3000 V for 15 min, and 3500 V for 4 h. After the proteins were separated by isoelectric focusing, the strips were incubated for 10 min in equilibration buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 6 m urea, 1% SDS, 30% glycerol, and 0.002% bromphenol blue) containing 0.25% dithiothreitol and subsequently for 10 min in the same buffer containing 4.5% iodoacetamide. The proteins in the strips were then electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gels (second dimension) and electrically transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was treated with monoclonal anti-p57/coronin-1 antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. The proteins were visualized by an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Co-sedimentation Assay with F-actin—HL60 cells (3 × 106 cells) were suspended in ice-cold G-actin buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm ATP, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) and homogenized with 30 strokes in a Dounce homogenizer (tight-fitting). After the homogenate was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 60 min, the supernatant was mixed with a 19 volume of 10× actin polymerizing solution (final concentration: 50 mm KCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm ATP) and actin (5 μg), and the mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 120 min to allow polymerization of G-actin. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 200,000 × g for 60 min, and the supernatant and precipitate were analyzed by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. Affinity Chromatography of p57/Coronin-1—HL60 cells (2.5 × 108 cells) that had been treated with or without PMA (150 nm) and calyculin A (100 nm) at 37 °C for 30 min were incubated with lysis buffer at 4 °C for 10 min, and the cell lysate was centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant obtained was applied to a column of anti-p57/coronin-1 antibody-conjugated Sepharose (12Oku T. Itoh S. Ishii R. Suzuki K. Nauseef W.M. Toyoshima S. Tsuji T. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). After unbound materials washed with PBS, p57/coronin-1 bound to the column was eluted with 0.1 m glycine-HCl buffer, pH 2.7. The eluate was immediately neutralized by adding a 19 volume of 1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.0, and an aliquot was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. For the detection of p57/coronin-1, the silver staining method (two-dimensional silver stain II kit, Daiichi Pure Chemical, Tokyo, Japan) was conducted according to the manufacturer's protocol. Actin that was co-purified with p57/coronin-1 was detected by immunoblotting using anti-actin antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody followed by the ECL detection system (GE Healthcare). Phagocytosis of IgG-coated Magnetic Beads—Human IgG (Sigma) was bound to Dynabeads M-270 carboxylic acid (3.0 μm; Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The IgG-coated beads were then opsonized with normal human serum (blood group AB, Sigma) for 30 min at 37 °C and washed twice with PBS. HL60 cells were differentiated in PRMI1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1.25% dimethyl sulfoxide for 5 days, and neutrophil-like differentiated HL60 cells (4 × 106 cells) were incubated with opsonized Dynabeads at 37 °C for 5–30 min. The cells phagocytosing Dynabeads were magnetically enriched, and the cytoskeleton-containing detergent-insoluble fraction was isolated as described above. Association of p57/Coronin-1 with the Actin Cytoskeleton—We first examined the association of p57/coronin-1 with the actin cytoskeleton in HL60 human leukemic cells. To enrich the actin cytoskeleton, the cells were extracted with cytoskeleton isolation buffer containing 1% Triton X-100 followed by centrifugation 5000 × g for 3 min. The actin-containing cytoskeleton was reported to be recovered in the precipitate fraction after these procedures (19Gatfield J. Albrecht I. Zanolari B. Steinmetz M.O. Pieters J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2786-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). When the supernatant and the precipitate fractions after centrifugation were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, a major part of p57/coronin-1 was recovered in the detergent-insoluble F-actin-rich fraction (Fig. 1A). We next microscopically observed the intracellular distribution of p57/coronin-1 and F-actin by using anti-p57/coronin-1 antibody and rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin, respectively. After HL60 cells were treated with cytoskeleton isolation buffer and fluorescently labeled with these reagents, the cells were observed using a confocal laser-scanning microscope. As shown in Fig. 1B, p57/coronin-1 was localized at the cell periphery showing a quite similar distribution of F-actin. We then examined the effect of latrunculin B, an F-actin-depolymerizing reagent (20Spector I. Shochet N.R. Blasberger D. Kashman Y. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1989; 13: 127-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (482) Google Scholar), on the co-localization of p57/coronin-1 with the cytoskeleton. Disruption of the actin cytoskeleton by the treatment of HL60 cells with latrunculin B (5 μm) at 37 °C for 30 min before cell lysis decreased the recovery of p57/coronin-1 in the detergent-insoluble fraction (Fig. 1C), concomitant with a lower yield of actin in the precipitate fraction. Our previous study indicated that p57/coronin-1 possessed at least two actin binding sites in the N-terminal region (11Oku T. Itoh S. Okano M. Suzuki A. Suzuki K. Nakajin S. Tsuji T. Nauseef W.M. Toyoshima S. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2003; 26: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). To examine the role of the putative actin-binding regions of the molecule in its association with the actin cytoskeleton, we prepared two constructs in which the full-length p57/coronin-1 (p57FL) and the C-terminal portion of p57/coronin-1 (p57LZ) cDNA were ligated with a vector containing the enhanced EGFP gene. The p57LZ construct lacks two putative actin binding regions but contains the leucine zipper motif in the coiled-coil domain, as schematically shown in Fig. 2A. The chimeric fusion proteins (EGFP-p57FL and EGFP-p57LZ) were expressed in HEK293T cells, and the intracellular distribution of these proteins in the transfected cells was observed under fluorescence microscopy. EGFP-p57FL was localized in the peripheral cortex region, whereas EGFP-p57LZ was rather diffusely distributed within a whole cell (Fig. 2B). After these cells were extracted with cytoskeleton isolation buffer, EGFP-p57FL was still present at least in part in the cell periphery, whereas EGFP-p57LZ was almost completely abolished. Furthermore, the analysis by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting indicated that EGFP-p57FL was detected in both the detergent-soluble and insoluble fractions but also that EGFP-p57LZ was recovered exclusively in the detergent-soluble fraction (Fig. 2C). These results suggest that the association of p57/coronin-1 with the actin cytoskeleton depends on the presence of the putative actin binding sites located in the N-terminal region. Effects of PMA Stimulation on the Intracellular Distribution of p57/Coronin-1—In the previous study we reported that p57/coronin-1 was phosphorylated upon the treatment of HL60 cells with PMA and that the phosphorylation of p57/coronin-1 was abrogated by inhibitors for PKC (16Itoh S. Suzuki K. Nishihata J. Iwasa M. Oku T. Nakajin S. Nauseef W.M. Toyoshima S. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2002; 25: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined the possible roles of p57/coronin-1 phosphorylation in its functions, such as binding capacity to the actin cytoskeleton. The actin cytoskeleton was isolated from HL60 cells that had been treated with PMA or chelerythrine, a pan-PKC inhibitor, and its interaction with p57/coronin-1 was analyzed. When the cells were stimulated with PMA, the distribution of p57/coronin-1 to the detergent-soluble fraction was increased in parallel with a decrease in that of the detergent-insoluble fraction (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the recovery of p57/coronin-1 in the detergent-insoluble fraction was slightly increased when the cells were pretreated with chelerythrine. The stimulation with PMA of chelerythrine-pretreated cells gave essentially the same result. Fluorescence microscopic observations of PMA-treated HL60 cells also demonstrated that the distribution of p57/coronin-1 to the cell periphery was clearly decreased upon PMA treatment without significant change in F-actin distribution (Fig. 3B, upper panels). The decrease in the distribution of p57/coronin-1 to the actin-rich cortical region after PMA treatment was confirmed by quantitative analysis of fluorescence intensity in the cross-section of the cell (Fig. 3B, lower panels). We further conducted time-course analysis of the translocation of EGFP-p57FL in transiently transfected HL60 cells after treatment with PMA. EGFP-p57FL fluorescence was originally located in the cell cortical regions and gradually decreased, showing a rather dispersed distribution within 15 min after treatment with PMA (Fig. 4A). We also attempted to observe this process in EGFP-p57FL-transfected COS-1 cells, in which cell cortex regions can be observed clearly by virtue of their large cell bodies with well spread morphology (Fig. 4B). Similar but more definite results were obtained in transfected COS-1 cells; namely, the fluorescence originally located at the cell periphery gradually decreased, disappearing almost completely 10 min after PMA treatment. In contrast, the treatment of these cells with chelerythrine increased the fluorescence localization in the cell cortex regions in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 4C). Separation of p57/Coronin-1 by Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—We next analyzed the phosphorylation status of p57/coronin-1 derived from PMA-treated, chelerythrine-treated, or chelerythrine plus PMA-treated HL60 cells as well as untreated cells by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. From the lysate of untreated HL60 cells, one major spot and one minor spot around pI 6.3 were detected by using anti-p57/coronin-1 antibody (Fig. 5A). When the cells were treated with PMA, we found three additional spots in more acidic regions. The chelerythrine-treated HL60 cells gave one major spot and one minor spot, as shown in the case of untreated cells. The pretreatment of the cells with chelerythrine abrogated the effect of PMA (Fig. 5B). These results indicate that p57/coronin-1 of HL60 cells are electrically heterogeneous, probably due to different degrees of phosphorylation. To examine whether the heterogeneity in electric charge of p57/coronin-1 was attributable to phosphorylation, the cell lysate was treated with alkaline phosphatase before electrophoretic separation (Fig. 5C). The alkaline phosphatase treatment of the cell lysate from PMA-treated HL60 cells eliminated acidic spots to give almost a single spot corresponding to that with the lowest pI. These results strongly suggest that p57/coronin-1 is phosphorylated in at least four sites in a PMA-dependent manner and that the phosphorylation modulates the ability of p57/coronin-1 to bind to the actin cytoskeleton. Modulation of Actin Binding Capacity of p57/Coronin-1 by Phosphorylation—We subsequently addressed the hypothesis that the phosphorylation of p57/coronin-1 down-regulates its binding to F-actin. The detergent-insoluble F-actin-rich fraction and the detergent-soluble cytosolic fraction were prepared from PMA-stimulated HL60 cells, and the phosphorylation of p57/coronin-1 present in these fractions was analyzed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in the pI range of 5.3–6.5. The results of immunoblotting indicated that the cytosolic fraction (supernatant) contained more phosphorylated forms of p57/coronin-1 than did the cytoskeletal fraction (precipitate) (Fig. 6); the phosphorylated forms of p57/coronin-1 in the supernatant and the precipitate were estimated be 72 and 45%, respectively, based on the intensities of the spots on the immunoblotting analysis. We next performed a co-sedimentation assay in which we analyzed p57/coronin-1 co-precipitated with F-actin after polymerization and centrifugation. G-actin was polymerized to form F-actin in the presence of the cytosolic fraction prepared from PMA-stimulated HL60 cells, and the reaction mixture was subjected to high speed centrifugation to sediment F-actin. The immunoblotting analysis of the supernatant and the precipitate fractions showed that a portion of the p57/coronin-1 derived from PMA-treated HL60 cells was precipitated with polymerized F-actin (Fig. 7A). We compared p57/coronin-1 co-precipitated with F-actin with that remaining in the supernatant after the actin polymerization for their phosphorylated nature. Although both the supernatant and the precipitate fractions gave rather similar profiles in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, the most acidic spot was detected only for p57/coronin-1 from the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 7B). The association of p57/coronin-1 with actin was also assessed by affinity chromatography using a column of anti-p57/coronin-1 antibody-conjugated Sepharose as described previously (12Oku T. Itoh S. Ishii R. Suzuki K. Nauseef W.M. Toyoshima S. Tsuji T. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The lysate of HL60 cells that had been treated with or without PMA was applied to the affinity column, and the proteins bound by the column were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining for p57/coronin-1 and immunoblotting for actin. As shown in Fig. 8, the amount of actin co-purified with p57/coronin-1 was decreased after HL60 cells were stimulated with PMA, although similar amounts of p57/coronin-1 were bound to and eluted from the column. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that the phosphorylation of p57/coronin-1 negatively regulates its association with the actin cytoskeleton. Intracellular Localization and Phosphorylation of p57/Coronin-1 during Phagocytosis—We finally examined the possible relationship between the intracellular distribution and phosphorylation level of p57/coronin-1 during phagocytosis in neutrophil-like differentiated HL60 cells. Differentiated HL60 cells phagocytosing IgG-coated Dynabeads were separated into detergent-insoluble cytoskeleton-rich and detergent-soluble cytosolic fractions, and the distribution of p57/coronin-1 in these fractions was analyzed by immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 9A, the amounts of p57/coronin-1 associated with the cytoskeleton decreased during the phagocytotic process, and this protein was distributed almost equally in both fractions 20 min after the initiation of phagocytosis. Two-dimensional electrophoresis revealed that the lysate prepared from cells phagocytosing beads for 15 min contained a phosphorylated form of p57/coronin-1 that was not observed in the lysate from non-phagocytosing cells (Fig. 9B). This result is consistent with our previous observation that the incorporation of 32P into p57/coronin-1 increased at a late phase of zymosan phagocytosis of [32P]phosphate-labeled differentiated HL60 cells (16Itoh S. Suzuki K. Nishihata J. Iwasa M. Oku T. Nakajin S. Nauseef W.M. Toyoshima S. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2002; 25: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the present study we characterized the phosphorylation of p57/coronin-1 and its role in regulating the association of this protein with the actin cytoskeleton. The supposition that phosphorylation attenuates the interaction between p57/coronin-1 and F-actin is based on the following results. 1) PMA treatment of HL60 cells or p57/coronin-1-transfected COS-1 cells decreased the association of p57/coronin-1 with the cytoskeletal fraction as assessed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting, in parallel with the reduction of the co-localization of p57/coronin-1 with actin filaments under microscopic observation (Figs. 3 and 4). 2) The p57/coronin-1 molecules associated with the actin cytoskeleton in HL60 cells, and those co-sedimented with F-actin polymerized in vitro were phosphorylated at lower levels than the molecules not associated with the actin filaments (Figs. 6 and 7). 3) p57/coronin-1 purified from PMA-treated HL60 cells showed lower affinity for actin than that purified from untreated HL60 cells (Fig. 8). The regulatory mechanism underlying the interaction between p57/coronin-1 and actin filaments seems to be of considerable importance, because the intracellular localization of this actin-binding protein changes during various actin-dependent cellular processes, including phagocytosis. Our experiment using neutrophil-like differentiated HL60 cells indeed indicated that p57/coronin-1 was dissociated from the actin cytoskeleton during phagocytosis of opsonized particles in association with phosphorylation of this molecule (Fig. 9). The phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of p57/coronin-1 appears to be regulated more actively in phagocytosing cells than in quiescent cells. The results obtained in this study may explain our previous observation that the dissociation of p57/coronin-1 transiently accumulated in phagosomes in neutrophils was impaired by treating the cells with PKC inhibitors (16Itoh S. Suzuki K. Nishihata J. Iwasa M. Oku T. Nakajin S. Nauseef W.M. Toyoshima S. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2002; 25: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The dissociation of p57/coronin-1 from F-actin-coated phagosomes is thought to be indispensable for phagosome-lysosome fusion, and PKC-dependent protein phosphorylation may be involved in this process (16Itoh S. Suzuki K. Nishihata J. Iwasa M. Oku T. Nakajin S. Nauseef W.M. Toyoshima S. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2002; 25: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 17Ferrari G. Langen H. Naito M. Pieters J.

Massner J. Pieters J. Cell. 2007; 130: 37-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). It is most likely that the dissociation of non-phosphorylated forms of p57/coronin-1 that cross-link F-actin associated with phagosomal membranes is triggered by phosphorylation catalyzed directly or indirectly by PKC. Thus, the phosphorylation of p57/coronin-1 appears to be important for the late phase of phagosome maturation. M. tuberculosis is known as an intracellular parasite that survives in phagosomes after being phagocytosed in macrophages accompanying the sustained accumulation of p57/coronin-1 on phagosomes containing mycobacteria (17Ferrari G. Langen H. Naito M. Pieters J. Cell. 1999; 97: 435-447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar). M. tuberculosis might escape attack from the host immune system by inhibiting the phosphorylation or enhancing the dephosphorylation of p57/coronin-1. It was reported that M. tuberculosis secreted phosphatases called MptpA and MptpB (21Koul A. Choidas A. Treder M. Tyagi A.K. Drlica K. Singh Y. Ullrich A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5425-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) and that these phosphatases were closely related to the virulence and the intracellular parasitism (22Singh R. Rao V. Shakila H. Gupta R. Khera A. Dhar N. Singh A. Koul A. Singh Y. Naseema M. Narayanan P.R. Paramasivan C.N. Ramanathan V.D. Tyagi A.K. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 751-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). However, considering that these phosphatases are tyrosine phosphatases (21Koul A. Choidas A. Treder M. Tyagi A.K. Drlica K. Singh Y. Ullrich A. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 5425-5432Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), they are unlikely to be implicated in the dephosphorylation of p57/coronin-1 because p57/coronin-1 is phosphorylated at serine residues (16Itoh S. Suzuki K. Nishihata J. Iwasa M. Oku T. Nakajin S. Nauseef W.M. Toyoshima S. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2002; 25: 837-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). A recent study by Jayachandran et al. (18Jayachandran R. Sundaramurthy V. Combaluzier B. Mueller P. Korf H. Huygen K. Miyazaki T. Albrecht I. Massner J. Pieters J. Cell. 2007; 130: 37-50Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) of mice deficient in p57/coronin-1 demonstrated that p57/coronin-1 was dispensable for the early phase of phagocytosis but was required for regulating lysosomal delivery of mycobacteria through the activation of the Ca2+-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin. In p57/coronin-1-deficient macrophages, therefore, the phagosome-lysosome fusion was not impaired, resulting in the killing of mycobacteria. Their study suggests a novel function of p57/coronin-1 in the Ca2+-dependent cellular signaling processes. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed two major and two minor spots of phosphorylated forms of p57/coronin-1 from PMA-treated HL60 cells (Fig. 5), suggesting that this protein possesses at least four potential phosphorylation sites. In the lysate of untreated HL60 cells, however, the non-phosphorylated forms were predominant. Similar results were obtained when we analyzed human neutrophils, human leukemic cell lines (THP-1, U937, and Jurkat), and murine RAW264.7 macrophage-like cells. 3T. Oku, Y. Kaneko, K. Murofushi, Y. Seyama, S. Toyoshima, and T. Tsuji, unpublished observation. In contrast, a large portion of the murine counterpart of p57/coronin-1 from the J774A.1 macrophage-like cell line was reported to be phosphorylated (19Gatfield J. Albrecht I. Zanolari B. Steinmetz M.O. Pieters J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 2786-2798Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation status of this actin-binding protein might depend on the cell type and species. It is highly probable that PKC is involved in the phosphorylation of the p57/coronin-1 molecule, but the phosphorylation sites have not been identified. Recently, Cai et al. (23Cai L. Holoweckyj N. Schaller M.D. Bear J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 31913-31923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) reported that PKC phosphorylated coronin-2 (also referred to as coronin-1B), a ubiquitously expressed member of the coronin family, and that the major phosphorylation site was Ser-2 of the molecule. The phosphorylation at this site was found to be involved in the regulation coronin-2 binding to actin-related protein complex 2/3 (Arp2/3) as well as in PMA-induced membrane ruffling and cell motility of fibroblasts. Our preliminary experiment using mass spectrometry indicated that Ser-2 of p57/coronin-1 is also phosphorylated, but we obtained no evidence so far showing that the phosphorylation at this site plays a role in regulating its actin binding activity. More recently, Foger et al. (24Foger N. Rangell L. Danilenko D.M. Chan A.C. Science. 2006; 313: 839-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) reported that p57/coronin-1 regulated chemokine-mediated migration of mouse T lymphocyte via an Arp2/3-dependent mechanism. Because the Arp2/3 complex is a key component for the formation of the actin filament networks, it is likely that the association of coronins to the Arp2/3 complex disturbs the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton through the inhibition of Arp2/3 complex activity. These studies, including ours, suggest that the phosphorylation of the coronin family of proteins is crucial for regulating the interactions between actin and various actin-associated proteins and that these interactions dynamically control the rearrangement of the actin networks and related cellular functions. The phosphorylation site(s) of p57/coronin-1 involved in the regulation of binding to actin filaments and the roles of the p57/coronin-1 phosphorylation in the reorganization of actin filaments are important issues remaining to be elucidated.

https://openalex.org/W2160622011,"Myotrophin, a 12-kDa ankyrin repeat protein, stimulates protein synthesis and cardiomyocyte growth to initiate cardiac hypertrophy by activating the NF-κB signaling cascade. We found that, after internalization into myocytes, myotrophin cotranslocates into the nucleus with p65 to stimulate myocyte growth. We used structure-based mutations on the hairpin loops of myotrophin to determine the effect of the loops on myotrophin and p65 localization, induction of protein synthesis, and cardiac hypertrophy. Loop mutants, most prominently glutamic acid 33→alanine (E33A), stimulated protein synthesis much less than wild type. Myotrophin-E33A internalized into myocytes but did not translocate into the nucleus and failed to promote nuclear translocation of p65. In addition, two cardiac hypertrophy marker genes, atrial natriuretic factor and β-myosin heavy chain, were not up-regulated in E33A-treated cells. Myotrophin-induced myocyte growth and initiation of hypertrophy thus require nuclear co-translocation of myotrophin and p65, in a manner that depends crucially on the myotrophin hairpin loops."
https://openalex.org/W1976028677,"Na,K-ATPase is the main active transport system that maintains the large gradients of Na+ and K+ across the plasma membrane of animal cells. The crystal structure of a K+-occluding conformation of this protein has been recently published, but the movements of its different domains allowing for the cation pumping mechanism are not yet known. The structure of many more conformations is known for the related calcium ATPase SERCA, but the reliability of homology modeling is poor for several domains with low sequence identity, in particular the extracellular loops. To better define the structure of the large fourth extracellular loop between the seventh and eighth transmembrane segments of the α subunit, we have studied the formation of a disulfide bond between pairs of cysteine residues introduced by site-directed mutagenesis in the second and the fourth extracellular loop. We found a specific pair of cysteine positions (Y308C and D884C) for which extracellular treatment with an oxidizing agent inhibited the Na,K pump function, which could be rapidly restored by a reducing agent. The formation of the disulfide bond occurred preferentially under the E2-P conformation of Na,K-ATPase, in the absence of extracellular cations. Using recently published crystal structure and a distance constraint reproducing the existence of disulfide bond, we performed an extensive conformational space search using simulated annealing and showed that the Tyr308 and Asp884 residues can be in close proximity, and simultaneously, the SYGQ motif of the fourth extracellular loop, known to interact with the extracellular domain of the β subunit, can be exposed to the exterior of the protein and can easily interact with the β subunit."
https://openalex.org/W2078175227,"Tuberin, a tumor-suppressor protein produced by the tuberous sclerosis gene TSC2, downregulates the Rheb-mTOR-S6K pathway (mTOR axis). Comparison of the effects of human tuberin mutations, such as G1556S, suggests that pathways other than the mTOR axis might also be involved in the pathogenesis of tuberous sclerosis. Here we test this possibility using the rat G1556S-type mutation (GSM) and a transgenic Eker (Tsc2 mutant) rat system. Cells expressing GSM-tuberin failed to downregulate the mTOR axis. GSM-tuberin had an altered localization, which underlie its reduced ability to form a complex with hamartin, and a site-specific alteration in phosphorylation status indicating diverse regulation by Akt. GSM-transgenic (GSM-Tg) rats exhibited suppression of macroscopic renal tumors following N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea treatment. Intriguingly, rats with weaker GSM-Tg expression showed microscopic cystic and pre-tumorous lesions that were restricted in size and expansion, although they had hyper-phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6. These results highlight a novel pathway involving tuberin that regulates tumor suppression independently of the mTOR inhibitory function. Identification of such a novel pathway will provide clear implications for generation of new therapeutic targets in the treatment of these tumors."
