https://openalex.org/W2038586807,"The 2;5 chromosomal translocation occurs in most anaplastic large-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas arising from activated T lymphocytes. This rearrangement was shown to fuse the NPM nucleolar phosphoprotein gene on chromosome 5q35 to a previously unidentified protein tyrosine kinase gene, ALK, on chromosome 2p23. In the predicted hybrid protein, the amino terminus of nucleophosmin (NPM) is linked to the catalytic domain of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Expressed in the small intestine, testis, and brain but not in normal lymphoid cells, ALK shows greatest sequence similarity to the insulin receptor subfamily of kinases. Unscheduled expression of the truncated ALK may contribute to malignant transformation in these lymphomas."

https://openalex.org/W1496897161,"Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis provides an important mechanism for regulating a variety of cellular processes. Ubiquitin-conjugated proteins are degraded by a 26 S protease that contains more than 30 different subunits. Of these, a single 50-kDa polypeptide, subunit 5, specifically binds ubiquitin-lysozyme conjugates. Binding is inhibited by short polymeric chains of ubiquitin but not by ubiquitin monomers or by lysozyme. In addition, subunit 5 binds free ubiquitin chains with efficient association requiring at least four ubiquitins. Thus, proteins conjugated to polymers of ubiquitin may be selected for degradation by a single subunit of the 26 S protease complex."
https://openalex.org/W2093364329,"The excitability of the human motor cortex during the development of implicit and declarative knowledge of a motor task was examined. During a serial reaction time test, subjects developed implicit knowledge of the test sequence, which was reflected by diminishing response times. Motor cortical mapping with transcranial magnetic stimulation revealed that the cortical output maps to the muscles involved in the task became progressively larger until explicit knowledge was achieved, after which they returned to their baseline topography. These results illustrate the rapid functional plasticity of cortical outputs associated with learning and with the transfer of knowledge from an implicit to explicit state."
https://openalex.org/W2036419095,"Positive and negative selection of a lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) peptide-specific, H-2Db-restricted T cell clone (P14) was studied using TAP1− and TAP1+ mice transgenic for P14 T cell receptor (TCR) α and β genes. Positive selection of transgenic CD8+ P14 cells was impaired in TAP1− mice. Addition of the LCMV peptide to TAP1− fetal thymic organ cultures (FTOCs) at low and high concentrations induced positive and negative selection of CD8+ P14 cells, respectively, while addition of the same peptide to TAP1+ FTOCs induced negative selection even at low concentrations. Both types of selection were peptide specific. Thus, a critical parameter that controls the fate of a thymocyte seems to be the number of TCRs engaged with complexes of peptide and major histocompatibility complex. When this number is low, positive selection occurs, and when it is high, negative selection takes place. These findings support a differential avidity model of T cell selection."

https://openalex.org/W2009017737,"Antisera from scleroderma patients that react widely with centrosomes in plants and animals were used to isolate cDNAs encoding a novel centrosomal protein. The nucleotide sequence is consistent with a 7 kb mRNA and contains an open reading frame encoding a protein with a putative large coiled-coil domain flanked by noncoiled ends. Antisera recognize a 220 kd protein and stain centrosomes and acentriolar microtubule-organizing centers, where the protein is localized to the pericentriolar material (hence, the name pericentrin). Anti-pericentrin antibodies disrupt mitotic and meiotic divisions in vivo and block microtubule aster formation in Xenopus extracts, but do not block γ-tubulin assembly or microtubule nucleation from mature centrosomes. These results suggest that pericentrin is a conserved integral component of the filamentous matrix of the centrosome involved in the initial establishment of organized microtubule arrays."

https://openalex.org/W2068982799,"We have previously described a type of selective T cell deficiency (STD) characterized by persistent infections reminiscent of severe combined immunodeficiency. We show here that STD patients carry a mutation of zap-70, resulting in loss of the activity of this kinase. The thymi of zap-70-/- patients show the presence of CD4+CD8+ cells in the cortex; however, only CD4, not CD8, single-positive cells are present in the medulla. Peripheral CD4+ T cells from the zap-70-/- patients exhibit markedly reduced tyrosine phosphorylation, fail to produce interleukin-2, and do not proliferate in response to T cell receptor stimulation by mitogens or antigens. Thus, Zap-70 kinase appears to be indispensable for the development of CD8 single-positive T cells as well as for signal transduction and function of single-positive CD4 T cells."
https://openalex.org/W2044463379,"Lactate and pyruvate cross cell membranes via a monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) with well-defined properties but undefined molecular structure. We report the cloning of a cDNA encoding MCT1, a monocarboxylate transporter whose properties resemble those of the erythrocyte MCT, including proton symport, trans acceleration, and sensitivity to alpha-cyanocinnammates. A Phe to Cys substitution in MCT1 converts it to Mev, a mevalonate transporter. MCT1 is abundant in erythrocytes, cardiac muscle, and basolateral intestinal epithelium. In skeletal muscle it is restricted to mitochondria-rich myocytes. As sperm traverse the epididymis, MCT1 switches from sperm to epithelial cells. MCT1 is present at low levels in liver, suggesting another MCT in this tissue. By exporting lactate from intestine and erythrocytes, MCT1 participates in the Cori cycle. It also participates in novel pathways of monocarboxylate metabolism in muscle and sperm."
https://openalex.org/W2042007591,"The centrosome nucleates microtubule polymerization, affecting microtubule number, polarity, and structure. We use an in vitro system based on extracts of Xenopus eggs to examine the role of gamma-tubulin in centrosome assembly and function. gamma-Tubulin is present in the cytoplasm of frog eggs and vertebrate somatic cells in a large approximately 25S complex. The egg extracts assemble centrosomes around sperm centrioles. Formation of a centrosome in the extract requires both the gamma-tubulin complex and ATP and can take place in the absence of microtubules. gamma-Tubulin is not present on the sperm prior to incubation in extract, but is recruited from the cytoplasm during centrosome assembly. The gamma-tubulin complex also binds to microtubules, likely the minus end, independent of the centrosome. These results suggest that gamma-tubulin is an essential component of the link between the centrosome and the microtubule, probably playing a direct role in microtubule nucleation."
https://openalex.org/W2017902030,"Newly synthesized proteins are believed to move from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi by bulk flow, and sorting is assumed to occur exclusively in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Using quantitative immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrate that vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) is sorted from resident ER proteins and concentrated 5- to 10- fold in 40–80 nm vesicles during vesicle budding from the ER. Accumulation of VSV-G in pre-Golgi vesicular carriers is the only detectable concentration step in its transport to the TGN. From these results, it is apparent that export from the ER is not exclusively mediated by bulk flow. The ER exerts an unanticipated level of control to insure selective and efficient entry of mature protein into the secretory pathway."
https://openalex.org/W1971693521,"Plant viruses establish a systemic infection by moving through plasmodesmata, but little is known of the mechanism(s) involved. The roles of two movement-associated proteins of a single-stranded DNA virus were investigated in vivo, using functional proteins expressed in E. coli and microinjection into plant cells. We report here that the BL1 protein of bean dwarf mosaic geminivirus moves extensively from cell to cell, increases mesophyll plasmodesmal size exclusion limit, and potentiates the movement of double-stranded DNA from cell to cell. Movement of single- and double-stranded DNA out of the nucleus is mediated by the BR1 protein. These results provide direct experimental evidence for intercellular macro-molecular transport in plants, and suggest that the BR1 and BL1 proteins coordinate the movement of viral DNA across both nuclear and plasmodesmal boundaries."

https://openalex.org/W2048599311,"A temperature-sensitive (ts) mutant retains the function of a gene at a low (permissive) temperature but not at a high (nonpermissive) temperature. Arg-DHFR, a dihydrofolate reductase bearing an amino-terminal (N-terminal) arginine, is long-lived in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, even though arginine is a destabilizing residue in the N-end rule of protein degradation. A ts derivative of Arg-DHFR was identified that is long-lived at 23°C but rapidly degraded by the N-end rule pathway at 37°C. Fusions of ts Arg-DHFR to either Ura3 or Cdc28 of S. cerevisiae confer ts phenotypes specific for these gene products. Thus, Arg-DHFRts is a heat-inducible degradation signal that can be used to produce ts mutants without a search for ts mutations."
https://openalex.org/W1983896852,"spätzle is a maternal effect gene required in the signal transduction pathway that establishes the dorsal-ventral pattern of the Drosophila embryo. spätzle acts immediately upstream of the membrane protein Toll in the genetic pathway, suggesting that spätzle could encode the ventrally localized ligand that activates the receptor activity of Toll. The spätzle gene encodes a novel secreted protein that appears to require activation by a proteolytic processing reaction, which is controlled by the genes that act upstream of spätzle in the genetic pathway. We propose that proteolytic processing of the spätzle protein is confined to the ventral side of the embryo and that the localization of processed spätzle determines where the receptor, Toll, is active."
https://openalex.org/W2040703859,"As NIH 3T3 fibroblasts become quiescent, the level of c-Jun protein decreases while JunD accumulates. When resting cells are stimulated with fresh serum, nuclear-localized JunD is rapidly degraded, followed by resynthesis of both c-Jun and JunD later in G1. Overexpression of JunD results in slower growth and an increase in the percentage of cells in while c-Jun overexpression produces larger and M phase populations. In addition, JunD partially suppresses transformation by an activated ras gene whereas c-Jun cooperates with ras to transform cells. These data indicate that two clsely related transcription factors can function in an opposing manner."
https://openalex.org/W2063563660,"The enteric bacteria Salmonella typhimurium has the ability to invade (enter) nonphagocytic cells. The internalization process occurs as a result of an intimate interaction between the bacteria and the host cell, in which S. typhimurium triggers a cascade of host cell-signaling events leading to the formation of host cell membrane ruffles and bacterial uptake. Using high resolution scanning electron microscopy, we have observed that contact with cultured epithelial cells results in the formation of appendages on the surface of S. typhimurium. The formation of such appendages did not require de novo protein synthesis, and it was transient, since these surface structures were no longer present on bacteria that had initiated the internalization event. Salmonella mutants defective in the transient formation of these surface organelles were unable to enter into cultured epithelial cells, indicating that such structures are required for bacterial internalization."
https://openalex.org/W2089015588,"The enzyme acetylcholinesterase generates a strong electrostatic field that can attract the cationic substrate acetylcholine to the active site. However, the long and narrow active site gorge seems inconsistent with the enzyme's high catalytic rate. A molecular dynamics simulation of acetylcholinesterase in water reveals the transient opening of a short channel, large enough to pass a water molecule, through a thin wall of the active site near tryptophan-84. This simulation suggests that substrate, products, or solvent could move through this ""back door,"" in addition to the entrance revealed by the crystallographic structure. Electrostatic calculations show a strong field at the back door, oriented to attract the substrate and the reaction product choline and to repel the other reaction product, acetate. Analysis of the open back door conformation suggests a mutation that could seal the back door and thus test the hypothesis that thermal motion of this enzyme may open multiple routes of access to its active site."

https://openalex.org/W2137401341,"The integrin alpha v beta 6 has been shown to be a fibronectin-binding protein. To determine whether the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of alpha v beta 6 are necessary for binding to fibronectin, a truncated, secreted form of the integrin lacking these domains was engineered and expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Fibronectin affinity chromatography demonstrated that the secreted integrin, like its full-length counterpart, was capable of binding fibronectin. Monoclonal antibodies were made to secreted alpha v beta 6 and to beta 6-transfected NIH 3T3 cells. In experiments designed to determine whether alpha v beta 6 can mediate cell attachment to fibronectin, full-length human beta 6 was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells and in the human colon carcinoma cell line SW480. beta 6-expressing cells were identified by alpha v beta 6-specific antibodies, and the beta 6-transfectants were used in cell-adhesion assays. In Chinese hamster ovary cells, human beta 6 associated with hamster alpha v but was incapable of mediating cell attachment to fibronectin. However, expression of beta 6 in these cells had the dominant negative effect of decreasing alpha v beta 5-dependent adhesion to vitronectin. In SW480 cells, beta 6 expression conferred the ability to bind to fibronectin even in the presence of inhibitory antibodies against beta 1 integrins. In such cells, fibronectin binding ability could be blocked by an antibody to alpha v integrins. These results constitute the first direct evidence that alpha v beta 6 mediates cell attachment to fibronectin."
https://openalex.org/W1518252063,"The protein kinase cascade Raf-MAPKK/MEK-MAPK/ERK connects protein tyrosine kinase receptors in the membrane with control of transcription factor activity in the nucleus. We have examined whether Raf is obligatory for activation of this cascade and whether this signaling pathway is relevant to transformation. By use of transient assays with epitope-tagged ERK-1 cDNA and a dominant inhibitory mutant of Raf-1 we found that serum and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate as well as representatives of three classes of oncogenes (protein tyrosine kinases abl/src, Ras, and protein serine/threonine kinases mos/cot) were all Raf-dependent for stimulation of MAPK. All of the MAPK stimulating oncogenes were also activators of Raf kinase as judged by shift induction. It thus appears that there is little or no redundancy in pathways used by growth regulators for activation of MAPK/ERK. Furthermore, the ability to stimulate MAPK/ERK appears to be critical for transformation by oncogenic Raf-1 and ERK-1 and -2 synergized with v-raf in a focus induction assay on NIH3T3 cells and kinase dead mutants of ERK-2 were inhibitory. Raf/ERK synergism was also observed in transcriptional transactivation of the oncogene-response element in the polyoma enhancer. We conclude that this Raf signaling pathway, which connects to many upstream activators and downstream effectors, is essential for transformation by most oncogenes."
https://openalex.org/W2059669080,"We have investigated the function of different structural domains of the Drosophila splicing regulator Transformer 2 (Tra2). We find that the ribonucleoprotein consensus sequence (RNP-CS) of Tra2 is required for male fertility and positive and negative control of alternative splicing in transgenic flies, as well as for in vitro binding of recombinant Tra2 to doublesex and tra2 pre-mRNAs. Thus, all of the known functions of Tra2 require specific protein-RNA interactions. We also show that one of the two arginine-serine (RS)-rich domains of Tra2 is dispensable, while the other is essential for all of the in vivo functions. Part of this domain is also required for RNA binding in vitro. Significantly, the essential RS domain is also required for specific protein-protein interactions. We find that Tra2 interacts with itself, with the splicing regulator Transformer, and with the general splicing factor SF2 in vitro and in the yeast two-hybrid system. These results demonstrate that both protein-RNA and protein-protein interactions are involved in tra2-dependent activation and repression of alternative splicing."
https://openalex.org/W2129387586,"We studied the molecular mechanism of demethylation and its role in kappa chain gene regulation. Following transfection into B cell cultures, this gene undergoes regional demethylation in a process that is developmentally regulated in a lineage- and stage-specific manner. Although a germline V kappa promoter is not required for the demodification activity, a fragment containing the intronic kappa chain transcriptional enhancer and the nearby matrix attachment region is essential. In its natural location downstream to the J kappa 5 sequence, this element induces bidirectional demodification of plasmid constructs in a distance- and orientation-independent manner. When this enhancer is placed in an upstream position, however, the kappa gene remains modified and transcriptionally inactive, demonstrating that demethylation is required for kappa chain activation. These studies suggest that the kappa enhancer plays a dual role in regulating B cell differentiation by inducing demethylation and by promoting tissue-specific transcription."
https://openalex.org/W1560464036,"Casein kinase II (CKII) is a ubiquitous serine/threonine protein kinase with many cellular functions, including participation in mitogenic signaling by cytoplasmic nuclear translocation (Lorenz, P., Pepperkok, R., Ansorge, W., and Pyerin, W. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 2733-2739). To examine whether cell compartment-specific availability is a requirement for CKII function during cell cycle progression, antibodies against CKII beta, the regulatory subunit of CKII, were microinjected into the cytoplasm or the nucleus of G0-synchronized human primary fibroblasts (IMR-90) at the time of mitogenic stimulation or at various intervals thereafter. Significant inhibition of the stimulation was obtained with both cytoplasmic and nuclear injections. The inhibition was reversible, was not observed with control antibodies, and was abolished by co-injection of purified CKII holoenzyme. The inhibition differed, however, in extent, duration, and cell cycle phase between cytoplasmic and nuclear injections. After cytoplasmic injection, inhibition reached 45-50% and was effective at two intervals within the first 2 h and at 12-16 h post-stimulation, i.e. at G0/G1 phase transition and at the G1/S phase boundary of the cell cycle. After injection into the nucleus, the inhibition was considerably stronger, reaching 80-85%, and was effective for the first 6 h post-stimulation, i.e. for the transition of G0/G1 phase and the adjoining first part of G1 phase. Cytoplasmic or nuclear injections within S phase affected neither DNA synthesis nor cell division. The data suggest that cell cycle transition from G0 to S phase requires the presence of a certain functional level of CKII at defined times and at defined cellular locations as follows: for transition of G0/G1 at both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, for transition of early G1 at the nucleus, and for transition of G1/S at the cytoplasm."
https://openalex.org/W2008569641,"Shigella flexneri, a gram-negative pathogen, invades the human colonic epithelium. After entering epithelial cells, bacteria escape into the cytoplasm, move intracellularly, and pass from cell to cell. The bacterium diverts actin and associated actin-binding proteins to generate a cytoskeleton-based motor that pushes forward the bacterium. As the moving bacterium reaches the inner face of the host-cell cytoplasmic membrane, a protrusion forms that allows passage of this bacterium into a neighboring cell. We show here that components of the intermediate junction are used by the bacterium to allow this passage. Using S180, a mouse fibroblastic sarcoma cell line that does not produce cell adhesion molecules (CAM), and S180L and S180cadN, the same cell line transfected with L-CAM and N-cadherin cDNA, respectively, we demonstrate that expression of a cadherin is required for cell-to-cell spread to occur."

https://openalex.org/W2167557899,"Three-dimensional light microscopy and the excellent cytological features of maize meiotic chromosomes are used to analyze the early events of chromosome synapsis. We demonstrate that the chromosomes undergo a dramatic structural reorganization prior to synapsis in zygotene. The unique features of prezygotene chromosomes are a partial separation of sister chromatids, an elongation of knob heterochromatin, an increase in surface complexity, a 50% increase in total chromosome volume, and a peripheral localization and alignment of telomeric, but not proximal, loci. At zygotene, chromosome volume decreases and chromosomes appear as single fibers. The specialized prezygotene chromosome morphology may facilitate homology recognition once the homologs have been brought together."

https://openalex.org/W2092121369,"Conversion of external signals into proliferative responses may be mediated by interactions between signaling pathways that control cell proliferation. Interactions between G alpha s, the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide binding protein that stimulates adenylyl cyclase, and Ras, an important element in growth factor signaling, were studied. Expression of activated G alpha s in NIH 3T3 cells increased intracellular concentrations of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) and inhibited H-Ras-stimulated DNA synthesis and mitogen-activated protein kinase activity. Activated G alpha s and 8-Br-cAMP suppressed H-Ras-induced transformation of NIH 3T3 cells. Apparently, G alpha s inhibits proliferative signals from Ras by stimulating cAMP production and activating protein kinase A."
https://openalex.org/W1510431864,"The role of mtDNA and nuclear genome in human aging was examined by their intercellular transfer using skin fibroblasts and mtDNA-less HeLa cells (rho o-HeLa cells). We found in vivo age-related reductions in the activity of cytochrome c oxidase in human skin fibroblasts obtained from 16 donors of various ages (0-97 years). The abnormality in mitochondria of the aged donors was not attributable to either decrease in the copy number of mtDNA molecules or increase in the copy number of deletion mutant mtDNA molecules, but to significant decrease in overall polypeptide synthesis in the mitochondria. However, intercellular mtDNA transfer experiments showed that fibroblast mtDNA from elderly donors is functionally intact. By contrast, intercellular transfer of HeLa nuclei to fibroblasts from aged donors restored cytochrome c oxidase activity, suggesting that the age-related phenotype was nuclear recessive. However, during subsequent cultivation of these hybrids, the activity gradually reduced again, associated with gradual chromosome loss. These observations support the idea that accumulation of nuclear recessive somatic mutations, but not mtDNA mutations, is responsible for the in vivo age-related mitochondrial dysfunction observed in human skin fibroblasts."
https://openalex.org/W2060654150,"Any RNA, when in a complex with another oligoribonucleotide known as an external guide sequence (EGS), can become a substrate for ribonuclease P. Simulation of evolution in vitro was used to select EGSs that bind tightly to a target substrate messenger RNA and that increase the efficiency of cleavage of the target by human ribonuclease P to a level equal to that achieved with natural substrates. The most efficient EGSs form transfer RNA precursor-like structures with the target RNA, in which the analog of the anticodon stem has been disrupted, an indication that selection for the optimal substrate for ribonuclease P yields an RNA structure different from that of present-day transfer RNA precursors."
https://openalex.org/W1532255632,"Transformation of mammalian cells by human papillomavirus type 16 appears to require binding of the viral E7 protein to the cellular retinoblastoma growth suppressor gene product (pRB). Binding of E7 protein to pRB inhibits several of pRB's biochemical properties, including association with the transcription factor E2F. Fragments of E7 protein derived from its conserved region 2 (CR2) domain bind to pRB and are sufficient to inhibit binding of full-length E7 protein to pRB. However, these CR2 fragments exhibit reduced affinity for pRB compared to the full-length protein and do not inhibit formation of the pRB-E2F complex. These observations suggest the existence of additional contact sites between the E7 protein and pRB. In the current study we have identified a region of E7, distinct from the CR2 domain, which is sufficient to bind pRB. This new pRB binding motif encompasses the zinc-binding conserved region 3 (CR3) domain of E7. Studies with a series of pRB deletion mutants suggest that pRB residues between amino acids 803 and 841 are necessary for binding to the E7 CR3 domain. An E7 CR3 peptide inhibits binding of E2F to pRB, indicating that E2F and E7(31-98) bind to pRB at the same or overlapping sites. These results are consistent with a model in which optimal binding of E7 to pRB requires at least two distinct contact sites: the previously identified high affinity interaction between the E7 CR2 domain and the pRB pocket region, and a second interaction between the E7 CR3 domain and the COOH-terminal region of pRB. The latter interaction is sufficient for E7's inhibition of E2F binding to pRB."
https://openalex.org/W2051523119,"We have discovered a unique group I intron-like insertion (DiSSU) in the nuclear small subunit ribosomal RNA gene of the myxomycete Didymium iridis. By sequence, DiSSU consists of a group I ribozyme at the 5' end, an open reading frame (ORF) in the middle, and a novel element at the 3' end. Intron RNA self-splices in vitro to yield ten major processed RNAs, including a full-length circle. The group I ribozyme can efficiently cleave at an internal processing site, which separates the group I ribozyme from the ORF. Surprisingly, deletion that remove the entire group I ribozyme do not impair cleavage at the 3' splice site, implying that the 3' element itself is a catalytic RNA. Deletions that remove portions of the 3' element prevent utilization of the 5' splice site, suggesting that this element cooperates with the upstream group I ribozyme in splicing. DiSSU appears to be the first example for the cooperative interaction of distinct ribozymes in RNA splicing."
https://openalex.org/W1502400772,"Phagocytes produce superoxide by the assembly of a multicomponent complex that utilizes NADPH for the reduction of molecular oxygen (NADPH oxidase). The components participating in the assembly are a membrane-bound flavocytochrome and three cytosolic proteins, one of which was shown to be a dimer of the small GTP-binding protein (G protein) Rac1 p21 or Rac2 p21 with GDP dissociation inhibitor for Rho (Rho GDI). We determined the identity and quantity of the nucleotide bound to Rac1 p21 by high performance anion exchange chromatography of extracts prepared from highly purified Rac1 p21-Rho GDI, isolated from guinea pig macrophage cytosol. Rac1 p21 contained only GDP at a ratio of close to 1 mol of GDP per mol of G protein. The GDP-bound form of Rac1 p21 complexed to Rho GDI functioned as a potent activator of NADPH oxidase in a cell-free system that contained no free GTP or ATP. We propose that the GDP-bound form of Rac1 p21 might be the physiological activator of NADPH oxidase in macrophages, following its dissociation from Rho GDI, and that nucleotide exchange or conversion to GTP is not necessarily involved."
https://openalex.org/W170823829,"A [2Fe-2S] cluster has been detected in mammalian ferrochelatase, the terminal enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway. Natural ferrochelatase, purified from mouse livers, and recombinant ferrochelatase, purified from an overproducing strain of Escherichia coli, were investigated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Mossbauer spectroscopy. In their reduced forms, both the natural and recombinant ferrochelatases exhibited an identical EPR signal with g values (g = 2.00, 1.93, and 1.90) and relaxation properties typical of [2Fe-2S]+ cluster. Mossbauer spectra of the recombinant ferrochelatase, purified from a strain of E. coli cells transformed with a plasmid encoding murine liver ferrochelatase and grown in 57Fe-enriched medium, demonstrated unambiguously that the cluster is a [2Fe-2S] cluster. No change in the cluster oxidation state was observed during catalysis. The putative protein binding site for the Fe-S cluster in mammalian ferrochelatases is absent from the sequences of the bacterial and yeast enzymes, suggesting a possible role of the [2Fe-2S] center in regulation of mammalian ferrochelatases."

To detect the association with misfolded hLZMs of cellular proteins involved in their folding, retention, and pre-Golgi degradation, a co-precipitation experiment was carried out using anti-hLZM antibody and metabolically labeled cell lysates, which were treated with a membrane-permeable cross-linking reagent.

https://openalex.org/W1534130514,"Abstract When Dictyostelium cells are stimulated with cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP), the major surface cAMP receptor expressed in early development, cAR1, undergoes a rapid phosphorylation and parallel decrease in electrophoretic mobility which may serve to regulate the activity of this G protein-coupled receptor. Biochemical analyses indicate the electrophoretic mobility shift is caused by phosphorylation of serine residues within the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The 18 serines of this domain are grouped in four clusters, designated 1 to 4 (in N- to C-terminal order). Two approaches were taken to determine the distribution of phosphorylation sites among the serine clusters. First, a proteolytic analysis of the C-terminal domain was performed. Second, mutants lacking various combinations of the serine clusters were created by site-directed mutagenesis and their abilities to undergo ligand-induced modification were determined. Both approaches yielded corroborative results consistent with the following model: the stimulus induces the addition of approximately two phosphates to cluster 1 and one to cluster 2; basal phosphorylation occurs predominantly in cluster 3 and to a lesser extent in cluster 2; and cluster 4 is not phosphorylated. The phosphorylation-deficient receptor mutants should be useful for establishing the role of ligand-induced phosphorylation of cAR1 in chemotaxis, cell-cell signaling, and gene expression."
https://openalex.org/W1562991820,"Deletions have been constructed in the region encoding the 91-amino acid propeptide of the vacuolar enzyme carboxypeptidase Y of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and in vivo effects of these mutations on the intracellular transport of the mutant proenzymes have been examined. Deletions did not include the vacuolar targeting signal, and none of the mutated forms of procarboxypeptidase Y was found to be secreted. All deletions, however, resulted in a decreased rate of transport of the truncated proenzymes from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Up to 29 residues close to the N terminus can be removed without completely eliminating transport of the mutated proenzymes to the vacuole. However, the C-terminal part of the propeptide contains elements which are essential, since two small deletions, of 9 and 15 residues, respectively, within this area resulted in loss of carboxypeptidase Y activity. This region is, however, not sufficient for efficient formation of active carboxypeptidase Y, since truncated precursors in which the vacuolar targeting signal was fused to the C-terminal part of the proregion did not give rise to active enzyme. Based on the results, we propose that the carboxypeptidase Y propeptide plays an essential role in guiding the proper folding of the protein in vivo and that many parts of the propeptide contribute, in an additive way, to this function."
https://openalex.org/W1530152906,"The bovine brain uncoating ATPase, a constitutive 70-kDa heat shock protein, uncoats clathrin-coated vesicles in an ATP-dependent reaction. The uncoating ATPase-clathrin complex formed from the uncoating reaction was compared to the complex formed by directly binding free clathrin to uncoating ATPase. The amount of the latter complex shows a simple hyperbolic dependence on either free clathrin or free uncoating ATPase concentration, whichever is in excess, with a binding stoichiometry of one uncoating ATPase per clathrin heavy chain. ATP markedly increases the rates of formation and dissociation of this complex while ADP profoundly inhibits these rates. At low uncoating ATPase concentrations, much more complex is formed by uncoating than by directly binding clathrin to enzyme. However, during column chromatography or dilution for electron microscopy, both types of complex dissociate in ATP but not ADP, and electron microscopy of both types of complex diluted into ADP shows binding only to the vertex of the clathrin triskelion. We conclude that the uncoating ATPase forms only one type of complex with clathrin and has only one site for nucleotide; ADP at this site prevents either formation or dissociation of complex, whereas ATP at this site allows both processes to occur rapidly."
https://openalex.org/W1564033268,"A chromosomal fragmentation procedure was employed to produce a deletion set of yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) from a parental YAC, GART D142H8, known to map to human chromosome 21q and to encode the human interferon-gamma receptor (Hu-IFN-gamma R) accessory factor gene as well as the phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase (GART) gene. When expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, these deleted YACs retain accessory factor activity, as judged by major histocompatibility complex class I antigen inducibility, until the deletions from the acentric end exceed 390 kilobases (kb). Therefore, the accessory factor (AF-1) gene can be localized to a 150-kb region at the left (centric) end of the parental 540-kb GART YAC. Cells containing functional YACs are also able to induce the ISGF3 gamma and gamma-activated factor (GAF) transcription factors, but were not protected against encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) upon treatment with Hu-IFN-gamma. Therefore, the Hu-IFN-gamma R and the AF-1 are sufficient for some, but not all, of the actions of Hu-IFN-gamma. We postulate that an additional accessory factor (AF-2) required for antiviral activity against EMCV is encoded on chromosome 21q."
https://openalex.org/W1602038637,"E2F is a mammalian transcription factor involved in cell cycle regulation. The retinoblastoma gene product, pRB, binds to E2F in a cell cycle-dependent manner and appears to turn E2F from a transcriptional activator into a repressor. We show here that in vitro binding of pRB has three major effects on the DNA binding properties of E2F affinity-purified from HeLa cells; pRB binding increases the half-life of E2F.DNA complexes 10-15-fold, it reduces E2F specific DNA binding in the presence of nonspecific DNA by sequestering E2F, and it partially reverses the DNA bending induced by E2F. Upon specific DNA binding, E2F induces a DNA bend with a flexure angle of 125 degrees. Both full-length pRB105 and the N-terminally truncated pRB60 bind to the E2F.DNA complex with a Kd,app of 150 pM and reduce the apparent DNA bending to less than 80 degrees. DNA footprinting analysis indicates that the nonspecific DNA binding activity of pRB is not involved in this effect. Our biochemical data suggest that transcriptional activation by E2F may involve DNA bending and that the reversal of bending upon binding of pRB may turn E2F into a repressor."
https://openalex.org/W1600556015,"A photoreactive analog of chloroquine, N-(4-(4-diethylamino-1-methylbutylamino)quinolin-6-yl)-4- azi do-2- hydroxybenzamide (referred to as ASA-Q), has been synthesized and shown to mimic the action of chloroquine in possessing substantial antimalarial activity against a chloroquine-sensitive strain of Plasmodium falciparum. As for chloroquine, ASA-Q is less effective at killing drug-resistant strains of malaria, and the resistance can be modulated using the reagent verapamil. ASA-Q has been radiolabeled with Na125I and used as a photoaffinity probe for labeling chloroquine-binding proteins in malaria-infected erythrocytes. Two proteins have been identified with apparent molecular masses of 42 and 33 kDa in both chloroquine-sensitive and chloroquine-resistant strains of malaria. Photoaffinity labeling of the two proteins by iodo-ASA-Q was competitively inhibited by an excess of unlabeled chloroquine. The structurally related antimalarials amodiaquine and quinine also inhibited labeling of the two proteins, while verapamil and doxycycline had no effect. We suggest that the two labeled proteins are the macromolecular targets of chloroquine action in malaria parasites."
https://openalex.org/W1572179792,"Transcription of type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) is governed by the viral long terminal repeat (LTR). By using HIV-1 LTR-directed reporter gene systems, we found that the DNA topoisomerase I inhibitor camptothecin inhibits Tat-mediated transactivation of HIV-1 LTR. The 293.27.2 cells that carry a stably transfected HIV-1 LTR-directed lacZ gene expression vector (pNAZ) were used. Inhibitions of LTR were observed at camptothecin concentrations (IC50 about 0.03 microM, which was an order of magnitude lower than for Ro 24-7429), which had minor effects on cell survival, expression of the cellular gene gro, or Rous sarcoma virus-directed chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene expression. Inhibition was also seen with RPMI 8402, which is a human CD4-positive lymphocyte line transiently transfected with a HIV-1 LTR-directed (CAT) gene. Experiments with HIV-1 LTR mutants suggest that transactivation response sequence but not NF-kappa B is responsible for the inhibition by camptothecin. The target for camptothecin may be a cellular factor that is important for the activation of HIV-1 LTR by Tat and thus may offer a potential target for therapy of HIV-1 infection."
https://openalex.org/W1495120799,"We introduced a promoter trap vector carrying a neo gene as a selectable marker into F9 cells and established several cell lines in which the expression of neo gene is under the control of an endogenous host gene that is active only in the undifferentiated F9 cells. Using one of these cell lines, G19, we isolated the integrated neo construct and its flanking host sequences by the plasmid rescue method, identified the host gene which contributes to the expression of neo gene, and named it the Zfp-57 gene. Two different Zfp-57 transcripts (1.8 and 3.2 kilobases) were identified in the undifferentiated F9 cells, and the levels of these transcripts were decreased significantly within a short time after induction of differentiation. We examined mouse organs for the presence of the Zfp-57 RNAs and found that the 1.8-kilobase RNA was detected only in the testis. The Zfp-57 cDNAs corresponding to the two different RNAs were isolated, and a comparison of the nucleotide sequences revealed that their coding regions were completely identical, but they differed both in length and in sequence of the 3'-untranslated region. The Zfp-57 cDNA encoded a protein consisting of 421 amino acids with an extremely high content of basic amino acid residues and multiple zinc finger motifs. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed that this protein is localized in the nucleus. These findings suggest that the Zfp-57 protein is a DNA-binding protein."

https://openalex.org/W2052765209,"Optic nerve terminals segregate by functional class into distinct layers in the lateral geniculate nucleus, the thalamic relay nucleus of the visual system. In the rhesus monkey, the number of geniculate layers changes abruptly from six posteriorly (central vision) to four anteriorly (peripheral vision). The plane of transition between these patterns passes through small laminar gaps corresponding to the perceptual blind spot caused by the exit of the optic nerve from the eyeball. However, this plane of transition has no apparent functional link to the blind spot. A thermodynamic model of geniculate morphogenesis supports the hypothesis that the blind spot traps the transition in its stereotypic position by introducing a singularity in an otherwise smooth gradient in forces guiding the development of geniculate morphogenesis. This relation suggests that small-scale anomalies may be important in the determination of large-scale patterns in biological structure."
https://openalex.org/W1561503922,"Stimulation of quiescent cells with growth factors triggers changes in gene expression through multiple signal transduction pathways. One of these changes in Swiss 3T3 cells is the strong accumulation of T1 mRNA which encodes a secreted glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Proliferating cells continued to express T1 mRNA at a lower level, whereas growth arrest induced either by serum deprivation or by contact inhibition was paralleled by the disappearance of the T1 mRNA. T1 mRNA synthesis in response to serum and platelet-derived growth factor stimulation is mediated through protein kinase C-dependent and protein kinase C-independent pathways. Activation of protein kinase A also led to T1 gene expression. Ongoing protein synthesis is a prerequisite for T1 gene induction by growth factors which defines T1 as a delayed early serum-responsive gene. The ability of the immediate early transcription factors c-Fos and FosB to directly induce the T1 gene was demonstrated in a conditional expression system in the absence of protein synthesis. Furthermore, all known inducers of the T1 gene also lead to c-fos gene activation. Thus we show that the T1 gene is regulated by signals which are transduced through multiple pathways and provide evidence that the Fos proteins play an important role in the integration of these pathways."
https://openalex.org/W1565507599,"Transcription of hemopexin (Hx) occurs predominantly in the liver. To investigate the contribution of the cis-acting enhancer element to the hepatocyte preferential expression, we performed chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (CAT) assays in HepG2 cells. A strong enhancer element was identified by successive truncation to reside in the region -157/-104 from the cap site. The Hx region -145/-125 interacts with rat liver nuclear proteins, as shown by standard DNA-protein binding assays. The nucleotide sequence -141AGACTTTGACCT-130 includes, in reverse orientation, a direct repeat of the imperfect AGGTCA sequence, one of the recognition motifs of the steroid-thyroid hormone receptor superfamily. That this AGGTCA repeat is an enhancer core of the Hx element was affirmed by mutational analyses. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, oligonucleotides, corresponding to binding regions of chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter transcription factor (COUP-TF) and apolipoprotein AI regulatory protein 1 (ARP-1) but not of hepatocyte nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4), competed with the Hx element for binding sites. Co-transfection analyses indicated that HNF-4 does not affect CAT expression whereas ARP-1 and COUP-TF repress it. Antibody supershift analyses suggested that HNF-4 and COUP-TF may not be major factors binding to the Hx element."
