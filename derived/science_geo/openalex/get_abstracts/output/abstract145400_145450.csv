https://openalex.org/W2092006899,"For mapping energetic interactions in proteins, a technique was developed that uses evolutionary data for a protein family to measure statistical interactions between amino acid positions. For the PDZ domain family, this analysis predicted a set of energetically coupled positions for a binding site residue that includes unexpected long-range interactions. Mutational studies confirm these predictions, demonstrating that the statistical energy function is a good indicator of thermodynamic coupling in proteins. Sets of interacting residues form connected pathways through the protein fold that may be the basis for efficient energy conduction within proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2027533965,"Ubiquitination of receptor protein-tyrosine kinases (RPTKs) terminates signaling by marking active receptors for degradation. c-Cbl, an adapter protein for RPTKs, positively regulates RPTK ubiquitination in a manner dependent on its variant SRC homology 2 (SH2) and RING finger domains. Ubiquitin-protein ligases (or E3s) are the components of ubiquitination pathways that recognize target substrates and promote their ligation to ubiquitin. The c-Cbl protein acted as an E3 that can recognize tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates, such as the activated platelet-derived growth factor receptor, through its SH2 domain and that recruits and allosterically activates an E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme through its RING domain. These results reveal an SH2-containing protein that functions as a ubiquitin-protein ligase and thus provide a distinct mechanism for substrate targeting in the ubiquitin system."

The first x-ray structure of a calicivirus capsid, which consists of 180 copies of a single protein, has been determined by phase extension from a low-resolution electron microscopy structure. The capsid protein has a protruding (P) domain connected by a flexible hinge to a shell (S) domain that has a classical eight-stranded beta-sandwich motif. The structure of the P domain is unlike that of any other viral protein with a subdomain exhibiting a fold similar to that of the second domain in the eukaryotic translation elongation factor-Tu. This subdomain, located at the exterior of the capsid, has the largest sequence variation among Norwalk-like human caliciviruses and is likely to contain the determinants of strain specificity and cell binding."

In CD2AP-deficient mice, immune function was compromised, but the mice died at 6 to 7 weeks of age from renal failure. In the kidney, CD2AP was expressed primarily in glomerular epithelial cells. Knockout mice exhibited defects in epithelial cell foot processes, accompanied by mesangial cell hyperplasia and extracellular matrix deposition.

Asymmetric localization of PIN1 develops from a random distribution in Arabidopsis early embryogenesis. Coordinated polar localization of PIN1 is defective in gnom embryos. GNOM is a membrane-associated guanine-nucleotide exchange factor on ADP-ribosylation factor G protein (ARF GEF). Thus, GNOM-dependent vesicle trafficking may establish cell polarity, resulting in polar auxin transport."

The trapped photoproduct corresponds to the late M state in the transport cycle-that is, after proton transfer to Asp85 and release of a proton to the extracellular membrane surface, but before reprotonation of the deprotonated retinal Schiff base. Its density map describes displacements of side chains near the retinal induced by its photoisomerization to 13-cis,15-anti and an extensive rearrangement of the three-dimensional network of hydrogen-bonded residues and bound water that accounts for the changed pKa values (where Ka is the acid constant) of the Schiff base and Asp85. The structural changes detected suggest the means for conserving energy at the active site and for ensuring the directionality of proton translocation."
https://openalex.org/W2027498284,Many human diseases are associated with the overproduction of oxygen free radicals that inflict cell damage. A manganese(II) complex with a bis(cyclohexylpyridine)-substituted macrocyclic ligand (M40403) was designed to be a functional mimic of the superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes that normally remove these radicals. M40403 had high catalytic SOD activity and was chemically and biologically stable in vivo. Injection of M40403 into rat models of inflammation and ischemia-reperfusion injury protected the animals against tissue damage. Such mimics may result in better clinical therapies for diseases mediated by superoxide radicals.
https://openalex.org/W1988515085,"A large first-order magnetic phase transition in an organic radical, 1,3,5-trithia-2,4,6-triazapentalenyl, is described. The transition occurs with a wide thermal hysteresis loop over the temperature range 230 to 305 kelvin. The high-temperature phase is paramagnetic, and its structure consists of a uniform one-dimensional stacking of the radical. The low-temperature phase is diamagnetic because of strong dimerization along the stacking direction. The results may have applications in thermal sensors, switching units, and information storage media based on organic radical crystals."

Southward grounding-line migration was dated past three locations in the Ross Sea Embayment. Results indicate that most recession occurred during the middle to late Holocene in the absence of substantial sea level or climate forcing. Current grounding-line retreat may reflect ongoing ice recession that has been under way since the early Holocene. If so, the WAIS could continue to retreat even in the absence of further external forcing."
https://openalex.org/W2042610497,"The effect of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) latent membrane protein 1 (LMP1) on the activation and differentiation of normal B cells was investigated. B cells of transgenic mice expressing LMP1 under the control of immunoglobulin promoter/enhancer displayed enhanced expression of activation antigens and spontaneously proliferated and produced antibody. Humoral immune responses of LMP1 transgenic mice in CD40-deficient or normal backgrounds revealed that LMP1 mimics CD40 signals to induce extrafollicular B cell differentiation but, unlike CD40, blocks germinal center formation. Thus, these specific properties of LMP1 may determine the site of primary B cell infection and the state of infection in the natural course of EBV infection, whereas subsequent loss of LMP1 expression may affect the site of persistent latent infection."

Unlike superoxide dismutase, the enzyme that protects aerobes from the toxic effects of oxygen, SOR does not catalyze the production of oxygen from superoxide and therefore confers a selective advantage on anaerobes.

https://openalex.org/W1981914794,"In addition to the CDP-choline pathway for phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis, the liver has a unique phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) methyltransferase activity for PC synthesis via three methylations of the ethanolamine moiety of PE. Previous studies indicate that the two pathways are functionally different and not interchangeable even though PC is the common product of both pathways. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that these two pathways produce different profiles of PC species. The PC species from these two pathways were labeled with specific stable isotope precursors, D9-choline and D4-ethanolamine, and analyzed by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. Our studies revealed a profound distinction in PC profiles between the CDP-choline pathway and the PE methylation pathway. PC molecules produced from the CDP-choline pathway were mainly comprised of medium chain, saturated (e.g.16:0/18:0) species. On the other hand, PC molecules from the PE methylation pathway were much more diverse and were comprised of significantly more long chain, polyunsaturated (e.g.18:0/20:4) species. PC species from the methylation pathway contained a higher percentage of arachidonate and were more diverse than those from the CDP-choline pathway. This profound distinction of PC profiles may contribute to the different functions of these two pathways in the liver.

This profound distinction of PC profiles may contribute to the different functions of these two pathways in the liver. phosphatidylcholine phosphatidylethanolamine CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase cytidine diphosphate phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis modified essential medium Phosphatidylcholine (PC)1 is a major group of phospholipid in all mammalian cells (1Vance D.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 1151-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). PC is comprised of hydrocarbon chains attached to glycerophosphocholine via acyl, alkyl, or alkenyl linkages. The molecular diversity of PC and other phospholipids is dictated by the combination of different lengths, number of double bonds, and types of linkages of hydrocarbon chains. As a result, a single mammalian cell contains at least a thousand species of phospholipids (2Raetz C.R.H. Hawthorone J.N. Ansell G.B. Phospholipids. Elsevier Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1982: 435-477Google Scholar). In most mammalian cells, PC is synthesized mainly via the CDP-choline pathway (3Cui Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2839-2843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This pathway uses choline as an initial substrate and is catalyzed by three enzymes: choline kinase, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT), and cholinephosphate transferase, with CT as the rate-limiting enzyme (1Vance D.E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1990; 68: 1151-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Hepatocytes are unique because they also possess a high activity of phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase (PEMT) that converts PE to PC via three sequential steps of methylation (4Vance D.E. Ridgway N.D. Prog. Lipid Res. 1988; 27: 61-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) in addition to a high level of CDP-choline pathway activity. The significance of the PEMT pathway is not completely understood (5Vance D.E. Walkey C.J. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 125-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The PEMT pathway seems redundant because its product, PC, is also synthesized by the CDP-choline pathway in hepatocytes. Therefore, the PEMT pathway is traditionally considered a backup pathway for PC synthesis in hepatocytes (3Cui Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2839-2843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, recent studies indicate that these two pathways apparently have opposite effects on proliferative characteristics of the liver and liver-derived cell lines (6Cui Z. Houweling M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24531-24533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Cui Z. Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 8Tessitore L. Cui Z.

These studies suggest that the higher activity of the CDP-choline pathway favors the faster proliferation of hepatocytes. Conversely, expression of PEMT strongly inhibits the growth of hepatoma cell lines and is negatively associated with the developmental growth of liver and with neoplastic growth of liver tumor induced by chemical carcinogens (6Cui Z. Houweling M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24531-24533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Cui Z. Vance D.E. Biochem.

Acta. 1997; 1346: 10-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Recombinant expression of PEMT in cultured cell lines leads to an active synthesis of PC via PE methylation (11Cui Z. Vance J.E. Chen M.H. Voelker D.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16655-16663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the PC synthesized via this methylation pathway does not substitute for the role of PC synthesized from the CDP-choline pathway (12Houweling M. Cui Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16277-16282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). MT58 is a cell line derived from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) K1 cells by chemical mutagenesis and carries a temperature-sensitive mutation in the rate-limiting enzyme, CT, of the CDP-choline pathway (13Esko J.D. Wermuth M.M. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7388-9325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the non-permissive temperature, CT becomes inactive, PC synthesis shuts down, and the mutant dies via apoptosis. Recombinant expression of rat liver CT rescues the mutant effectively, whereas recombinant expression of rat liver PEMT fails to rescue MT58 cells at the non-permissive temperature (12Houweling M. Cui Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16277-16282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Apparently the roles of the CDP-choline pathway and the PEMT pathway are distinct and not interchangeable. One hypothesis for this distinction is that PC synthesized from different pathways may have different subcellular locations. The ability of exogenous PC to rescue the mutant phenotype (14Esko J.D. Nishijima M. Raetz C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1698-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) suggests, however, that PC synthesized at one subcellular location is unlikely to be restricted from moving freely to another subcellular location. Thus, the hypothesis of distinctive localization of PC is an unlikely explanation for why PEMT fails to rescue the mutant. Another hypothesis is that the two pathways synthesize different pools of PC molecular species. To test this hypothesis, we devised a novel strategy capable of specifically displaying the PC species derived from the CDP-choline pathway and the PEMT pathway. We report here that the PC species synthesized from the CDP-choline pathway were mainly comprised of medium chain and saturated species, whereas the PC species derived from the methylation pathway are mainly comprised of long chain and highly unsaturated species. Our study suggests that the difference in PC composition contributes to the functional distinction between the two pathways. D4-ethanolamine and D9-choline chloride were from Isotec, Inc. [3H]ethanolamine was from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc. Dulbecco's modified essential medium (MEM) and fetal bovine serum were from Life Technologies, Inc. Silica gel H plates were from Analtech, Inc. Phospholipid standards were from Avanti Polar Lipids. All other chemicals and materials were from Fisher Scientific. Rat primary hepatocytes were obtained by collagenase perfusion (15Davis R.A. Engelhorn S.C. Pangburn S.H. Weinstein D.B. Steinberg D. J. Biol.

Hepatocytes were cultured on collagen-coated culture dishes overnight prior to experiments in Dulbecco's MEM with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml insulin, and 10 mm Hepes buffer. McArdle RH7777 cells were dually transfected with 10 μg of pCMV5/PEMT2 (11Cui Z. Vance J.E. Chen M.H. Voelker D.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16655-16663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and 1 μg of pSV2neo plasmid by calcium phosphate precipitation as described (16Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4799) Google Scholar). G418-resistent colonies were selected with 500 μg/ml G418 and maintained in 200 μg/ml G418. 3.5 × 105 cells were labeled with 1 μCi/ml each, [3H]choline chloride, or [3H]ethanolamine HCl for 24 h in low choline medium (choline-free MEM + 2% fetal bovine serum). Cells were scraped into methanol, and lipids were extracted according to Bligh and Dyer (17Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). The lipid extracts were separated on silica gel H plates in a solvent system of 65/35/8 chloroform/methanol/ammonium hydroxide. The phospholipid bands were visualized by iodine vapor and the PC and PE bands were scraped and counted by scintillation counter. 3.5 × 105 cells were incubated in low choline medium containing 50 μg/ml D9-choline chloride and 50 μg/ml D4-ethanolamine for 24 h or otherwise noted. Cells were scraped into methanol and lipids were extracted. Extracts were measured for lipid phosphorus content (18Rouser G. Siakotas A.N. Fleisher S. Lipids. 1966; 1: 85-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). Lipid extract equaling 500 pmol total lipid phosphorus in 100 μl of 2:1 methylene chloride:methanol was analyzed on a Micromass Quattro II triple quadruple mass spectrometer (Micromass, United Kingdom) in a solvent system of 45/45/10 methylene chloride/methanol/H2O. Data were acquired using MassLynx NT software (Micromass Limited, United Kingdom). A mixture of di-14:0, di-16:0, 16:0–18:1, and di-20:4 PC standards of equal concentration was used to determine instrument settings and concentration for optimal signal intensities. Standards and samples contained 1% formic acid for positive ion analysis, and 1% ammonium hydroxide for negative ion analysis. PC molecular species were detected by precursor ion scanning for m/z +184, +188, and +193 in the positive ion mode. PE molecular species were detected by neutral loss scanning for m/z 141 or 145 in the positive ion mode. The fatty acid composition of each molecular specie was determined by daughter ion analysis in the negative ion mode. The intensities of PC species with equal concentration decreased significantly as mass increased. To correct spectra for mass discrimination, PC standards were analyzed at equal concentrations. The equation derived by plotting intensity versus mass was used to correct raw results: y = y′ · [b/([−4963.4 · (x − 678)] +b)] (y = corrected intensity of each peak,y′ = actual intensity of each peak, b = intensity of the internal di-14:0 PC standard, and x =m/z of each peak). Fifty μg of total protein from each cell line was separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (19Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (20Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44644) Google Scholar). The membranes were probed with anti-PEMT2 (11Cui Z. Vance J.E. Chen M.H. Voelker D.R. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16655-16663Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate.

Biochem. 1991; 198: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) of PC species labeled with specific deuterated precursors allowed us to distinguish the PC species synthesized from the CDP-choline pathway and the PE methylation pathway (Fig.1 A). Different phospholipid classes were specifically detected by the unique mass/charge (m/z) ratio of the molecular fragments produced upon argon-induced collision. All PC molecules produced a fragment withm/z of +184 corresponding to the protonated phosphocholine head group. All PE molecules were detected by the loss of a neutral fragment of m/z 141, corresponding to the uncharged phosphoethanolamine head group. D4-ethanolamine-labeled PC species with m/z +188 head group were exclusively derived from the PE methylation pathway, and D9-choline-labeled species with m/z +193 head group were specifically synthesized from the CDP-choline pathway. The major advantage of this strategy is that the metabolism of major phospholipid groups can be analyzed from total lipid extracts without any chemical modification. Thus, the peak intensity of each lipid reflects a physiological concentration. To determine whether the incorporation of the D4-labeled choline into PC is a reflection of true PC synthesis from natural choline, we compared the profile of unlabeled PC to that of deuterium-labeled PC in RH7777 cells. RH7777 is a hepatoma-derived cell line in which PEMT activity is absent (7Cui Z. Vance D.E. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 939-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus PC is synthesized exclusively from the CDP-choline pathway in RH7777. The profile of labeled PC species was nearly identical to the profile of endogenous PC species (Fig.1 B). PC species with m/z +193 head group were not detected in the absence of D9-choline (data not shown). Daughter ion analyses of parent ions readily identified the molecular specie(s) under each peak (e.g. Fig. 1 C) and were capable of distinguishing ether lipids from diacyl lipids with similar mass. There are additional findings worthy of notice. First, in addition to the readily identifiable PC species, several phosphocholine-containing lipids didn't match with any deduced structures andm/z of diacyl, 1-alkyl/2-acyl, or 1-alkenyl/2-acyl. The structures of these novel lipids are currently under investigation. Second, because of their biphasic nature, most lyso-PC species were lost in the water phase during lipid extraction according to the method of Bligh and Dyer (17Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar). This problem can be solved by modification of the lipid extraction and lyso-PC species will be a subject of future studies. To determine whether D4-choline was a viable precursor of PC synthesis, we incubated the RH7777 cells with the labeled choline for various times. A time-dependent accumulation of the labeled PC was observed (Fig. 1 D), suggesting that deuterium-labeled choline was indeed a viable precursor for PC synthesis. To determine the PC profile of the PEMT pathway, we reconstituted the rat liver PEMT into the rat hepatoma cell line McARH7777, in which PEMT is absent. Thus, changes in PC synthesis as a specific result of PEMT expression were determined. The stably expressed PEMT was confirmed by Western blot analysis using a rat liver PEMT-specific antibody (9Houweling M. Cui Z. Vance D.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1346: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A). The reconstituted PEMT pathway was confirmed by measuring the incorporation of [3H]ethanolamine into PC isolated by thin layer chromatography (Fig. 2 B). The cells were then labeled simultaneously with excess D9-choline and D4-ethanolamine for 24 h at 37 °C. Total lipids were extracted and analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry. The PC species with head group mass of 188 were derived exclusively from the PEMT pathway and were detected only in the RH7777 cells that expressed PEMT (Fig. 2 F) and not in the control cells, in which PEMT activity was absent (Fig. 2 E). The PC species with head group mass of 193 from the CDP-choline pathway were present in both control and PEMT-expressing cell lines and were not affected by the expression of PEMT (Fig. 2, C andD). In the PEMT-expressing RH7777 cells, comparison between PC species newly synthesized from the CDP-choline pathway (Fig. 2 D) and that from the PE methylation (Fig. 2 F) revealed a clear distinction. The major species of the PC derived from the CDP-choline pathway were diacyl 16:0/18:1, 18:0/18:2, and 18:1/18:1, which together made up a majority of the choline-derived PC. On the other hand, PC derived from the methylation pathway contained significantly more long chain, polyunsaturated PC species (18:1/18:1; 18:0/18:2; 18:2/20:4; 18:1/20:4; 18:0/20:4; 18:0/22:6; 18:1/22:5). These findings were in agreement in principal with the previous report that purified PEMT prefers the long chain polyunsaturated PE as substrate (26Ridgway N.D. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16856-16863Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for PC synthesis. To determine whether these distinct profiles of PC in RH7777 cells reflected the physiological status of PC synthesis in the liver in which the CDP-choline pathway and PEMT pathway are endogenously co-existent, we performed similar studies in freshly prepared hepatocytes. The primary hepatocytes were labeled with the D4-labeled ethanolamine and D9-choline for 24 h. The total lipids were then extracted and analyzed. The distinction of the PC species from the two pathways was much more profound in primary hepatocytes than that of RH7777/PEMT cells (Fig. 3 and TableI). The PEMT pathway in primary hepatocytes produced more 38-carbon PC species of 18:2/20:4 and 18:0/20:4 than that in RH7777/PEMT cells. The differences between RH7777/PEMT and primary hepatocytes may reflect the fact that RH7777 cells are fast dividing cells in which bioactive PC species are turning over faster than those in the non-dividing hepatocytes.Table IQuantitation of PC species in primary hepatocytesm/z% of total PCPC acyl composition12345677321.0ND16:0–16:114:0–18:17342.41.9A–18:216:0–16:075817.06.316:0–18:2A–18:0A–18:1A–20:476024.37.316:0–18:1A–18:2A–20:378214.614.116:0–20:418:2–18:2A–18:0A–22:67846.64.418:1–18:216:0–20:37864.98.018:1–18:118:0–18:27886.94.4A–20:4A–16:08062.47.118:2–20:416:0–22:68086.68.316:0–22:518:1–20:4A–18:28107.618.018:0–20:416:0–22:48321.72.7A–20:4A–16:08340.76.618:0–22:618:1–22:58360.75.1A–18:2A–18:118:0–22:5Total chloroform extracts of primary hepatocytes were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Lipids with head group mass of 184 (unlabeled), 188 (from the PE methylation pathway), and 193 (from the CDP-choline pathway) were identified by electrospray tandem mass spectrometry.

Although primary hepatocytes did not divide in cultures, we wondered to what degree the endogenous PC was replaced by the newly synthesized PC when excess D4-ethanolamine and D9-choline were present in the culture media. We labeled the cells for 24 h with both deuterated precursors. Comparison of unlabeled PC between labeled cells and unlabeled cells revealed that over 75% of endogenous PC was replaced by the newly synthesized PC in 24 h (Fig.4, A and B). Of the labeled PC, 70% was from the CDP-choline pathway and 30% was from the PE methylation pathway. The turnover of PC was surprisingly active even when hepatocytes were essentially in a quiescent state. Comparison of the residual PC species to that in the unlabeled cells suggests that the turnover of 16:0/18:2, 16:0–20:4, 18:1/18:1, 18:2–20:4, 18:0/20:4, and 18:0–22:6 species were much more active than that of 16:0/18:1 (Fig. 4, C and D). PC species derived from PE may be more actively metabolized than the choline-derived PC species. Additionally, PC species from the methylation pathway contained a higher percentage of arachidonate (Fig. 3 B). Given the widely spread involvement of arachidonic acid in cellular regulations, the PC species derived from the PEMT pathway in the liver may serve as an important source for generating lipids active in cellular regulation. The biochemical significance of the PEMT pathway in hepatocytes has been of great interest because the CDP-choline pathway is already present in all mammalian cells and is sufficient for PC synthesis.In vivo studies reveal that the PEMT pathway contributes significantly to the survival of rats during complete deficiency of dietary choline (3Cui Z. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2839-2843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), suggesting that up-regulation of PEMT pathway might, at least in part, substitute for the role of the CDP-choline pathway. At the cellular level, however, it is surprising that PEMT fails completely to compensate for the defective synthesis of PC. Our current study revealed a molecular basis for biochemical distinction between the CDP-choline pathway and the PEMT pathway. This biochemical distinction apparently lies within the unique compositions of PC species derived from different pathways. Our studies also point out that the CDP-choline pathway synthesized only two or three major species of PC in primary hepatocytes, whereas the PEMT pathway generates at least eight major species of PC with significant efficiency. Therefore, the substrate specificity of the PE methylation pathway is much wider than that of the CDP-choline pathway. In MT58 cells, CT activity is temperature sensitive (13Esko J.D. Wermuth M.M. Raetz C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7388-9325Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Exogenous PC with medium side-chains and high degree of saturation can rescue the mutant cells at the non-permissive temperature (14Esko J.D. Nishijima M. Raetz C.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 1698-1702Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). However, long-chain and highly unsaturated PC species are “toxic” to the cells. Expression of PEMT in RH7777 displayed a strong and quantitative inhibition of cell growth (6Cui Z. Houweling M. Vance D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24531-24533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that the inhibitory effect of PEMT expression in RH7777 cells may be because of the production of long-chain highly unsaturated PC species that are “toxic” to the cells. The profound distinction in PC molecular species from the two pathways was unexpected. Nevertheless, given the opposite effects of the two pathways on hepatocyte proliferation, this distinction in PC species may account for most, if not all, of the functional difference of the two pathways. This profound distinction may also reflect a possibility that both the cholinephosphotransferase and the PE methyltransferase have preference for fatty acid side-chains in addition to the head group specificity. However, it cannot be excluded that the distinct function of the PEMT pathway may also be because of a selective depletion of PE species as the initial substrates of methylation. PC species turn over at fast and yet different rates even in non-dividing cells. With our current strategy of labeling and detection, all molecular species of PC can be cleanly resolved and readily quantitated. Not only can the PC species from different pathways be distinguished unequivocally via labeling with distinctive precursors, but the newly synthesized PC can be compared with the pre-existing PC species. The latter feature of this strategy offers a unique advantage allowing a precise estimation of turnover rates of all subclasses and all species of phospholipids. Mass spectrometry offers a resolution of at least 0.01% m/z (or 0.1 dalton for PC species). Such a resolution is capable of detecting changes of one proton at either head group or side-chains. Tandem mass spectrometry eliminates any requirement for separating phospholipid subclasses before analysis. Thus, chloroform extracts of cells can be directly analyzed. This advantage appears critical for analysis of phospholipid species because many separation procedures, such as the thin layer chromatography, introduce preferential loss of certain species (results not shown). The sensitivity of this strategy requires no more than 5,000 cells for analyzing the profiles of phospholipid species. With the addition of a nanospray device, lipids from as few as 50 cells will provide ample amount of materials for analysis. With such unprecedented resolution, sensitivity, and simplicity of tandem mass spectrometry, appropriate labeling with stable isotope precursors shall reveal many aspects of lipid metabolism that cannot be clearly addressed by radioactive labeling. We thank Dr. Dennis Vance for providing antibodies to PEMT, Mike Samuel for providing technical assistance for mass spectrometry analysis, and Dr. Tom Thuren and Lynn King for providing the primary rat hepatocytes."

The integrin-binding surfaces of invasin and fibronectin include similarly located key residues, but in the context of different folds and surface shapes.

Pichersky E. Kloppstech K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 181-186Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). These pigment-protein complexes are organized around photosynthetic reaction centers to form supramolecular complexes embedded into the thylakoid membrane, accounting for ∼70% of the pigment involved in plant photosynthesis. LHCII1 is the most abundant light-harvesting complex in higher plants. The structure of this complex has been resolved at 3.4 Å by electron microscopy (2Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar) and is formed by three hydrophobic transmembrane helices connected by hydrophilic loops and an amphipathic helix exposed to the luminal surface of the membrane. LHCII coordinates 7 Chl a, 5 Chlb, and 3–4 carotenoid molecules (lutein, neoxanthin, and a substoichiometric amount of violaxanthin) depending on the genotype (3Connelly J.P. Muller M. Bassi R. Croce R. Holzwarth A.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and the physiological state of the plant (4Verhoeven A.S. Adams III, W.W. Demmig-Adams B. Croce R. Bassi R. Plant Physiol. ( Bethesda ). 1999; 120: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In the structural model of LHCII (2Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar), 2 xanthophyll molecules have been located in the center of the complex, forming an internal cross-brace interacting with helices A and B. These appear to be crucial for protein stabilization, as suggested by the fact that a stable LHCII complex cannot be obtained without lutein in refolding experiments (5Plumley F.G. Schmidt G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 146-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Paulsen H. Rümler U. Rüdiger W. Planta ( Heidelb. ). 1990; 181: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Although the 2 central molecules were tentatively assigned to lutein (2Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N. Fujiyoshi Y. Nature. 1994; 367: 614-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1538) Google Scholar), the structural resolution is insufficient for their identification and for the location of the xanthophyll molecule with respect to the 2 detected by structural analysis. The nature and location of the binding site for the third xanthophyll molecule are presently unknown. It is also unclear if the individual binding sites have different affinities for the three xanthophyll species. Carotenoids have at least five different roles in photosynthesis: 1) light harvesting, 2) chlorophyll triplet quenching, 3) singlet oxygen scavenging, 4) excess energy dissipation, and 5) structure stabilization and assembly. In most cases, interaction with Chl molecules plays an important role. A tentative assignment of the chlorophyll type bound to individual sites was based on the proximity of 7 chlorophyll molecules to the 2 central xanthophyll molecules. It was argued that most of the triplet states will be formed on Chla because of the sub-picosecond energy transfer from Chlb to Chl a, which is faster than triplet formation. Therefore, only Chl a triplets need to be quenched and therefore in close contact with xanthophyll molecules. The above assignment is not in agreement with studies of the triplet activity in LHCII (7van der Vos R. Carbonera D. Hoff A.J. Appl. Magn. Res. 1991; 2: 179-202Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 8Carbonera D. Giacometti G. Rend. Fis. Acc. Lincei. 1992; 3: 361-368Crossref Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 9Van der Vos R. Franken E.M.

J. 1995; 69: 2670-2678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), suggesting the involvement of additional xanthophyll molecules. Accordingly, direct energy transfer between xanthophylls and Chl b was observed (3Connelly J.P. Muller M. Bassi R. Croce R. Holzwarth A.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), suggesting that at least some of the Chl b sites are in close contact with xanthophylls. In this work, we report the identification of a third carotenoid-binding site within monomeric LHCII and on the selectivity of the three binding sites for the different xanthophyll species components of LHCII. The molecular structures of the xanthophylls investigated in this work are shown in Fig.1. By using in vitroreconstitution of recombinant LHCII, overexpressed in bacteria, with different pigment preparations, we obtained LHCII complexes that bind either a single xanthophyll species or combination of two. Biochemical, spectroscopic, and functional characterization of these recombinant proteins provides evidence for distinct binding sites for lutein and neoxanthin and for strong interaction of carotenoid molecules with both chlorophylls a and b, thus affecting their spectroscopic properties. A construct overexpressing LHCII was obtained by mutagenesis of the Lhcb1 cDNA clone (11Bujard H. Gentz R. Lanzer M. Stüber D. Müller M. Ibrahimi I. Hauptle M.T. Dobberstein B.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 6302Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) to obtain a BamHI restriction site at nucleotide 155 and aHindIII site at position 880 immediately after the stop codon. The resulting fragment was inserted into the pQE52 expression vector (pDS series; QIAGEN Inc.) (11Bujard H. Gentz R. Lanzer M. Stüber D. Müller M. Ibrahimi I. Hauptle M.T. Dobberstein B.

The pDL2BH3 construct codes for a protein containing one additional Ile (which substitutes for the first Ala of the transit peptide) and a two-amino acid vector portion: Arg-Ile. The construct were controlled by automated cycle sequencing of both strands. LHCII was isolated from the SG13009 strain transformed with the LHCII construct as described previously (12Giuffra E. Cugini D. Croce R. Bassi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These procedures were performed as described (12Giuffra E. Cugini D. Croce R. Bassi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. The Chl/protein ratio in the reconstitution mixture was set to 20, and the carotenoid/protein ratio was set to 7. The Chl a/b ratio in the mixture was 2.3. Nondenaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described previously (13Ros F. Bassi R. Paulsen H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 253: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Purification of reconstituted LHCII was performed by ion-exchange chromatography (12Giuffra E. Cugini D. Croce R. Bassi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). For determination of pigment/protein stoichiometry, a fully purified protein was obtained, which did not contain any residual contamination by bacterial proteins, by preparative isoelectric focusing (14Dainese P. Hoyer-Hansen G. Bassi R. Photochem. Photobiol. 1990; 51: 693-703Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), followed by ultracentrifugation in a glycerol gradient (15–40% containing 0.06% β-dodecyl maltoside and 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.6); 12 h at 60,000 rpm in a Beckman SW 60 rotor) to eliminate ampholytes. The concentration of the LHCII apoprotein purified from Escherichia coli inclusion bodies was determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (12Giuffra E. Cugini D. Croce R. Bassi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). For stoichiometric (pigment/protein ratio) determination, the protein concentration was determined by the ninhydrin method (15Hirs C.H.W. Methods Enzymol. 1967; 11: 325-329Crossref Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Chlorophyll concentration was determined as described (16Porra R.J. Thompson W.A. Kriedemann P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 975: 384-394Crossref Scopus (4682) Google Scholar). HPLC analysis was as described (17Gilmore A.M. Yamamoto H.Y. J. Chromatogr. 1991; 543: 137-145Crossref Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Absorption spectra were obtained using an SLM-AMINCO DW-2000 spectrophotometer at room temperature. Fluorescence emission spectra were obtained at room temperature using a Jasco FP-777 spectrofluorometer. CD spectra were obtained at 8 °C with a Jasco 600 apparatus. The samples were diluted in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.6), 0.06% β-dodecyl maltoside, and 20% glycerol. Chlorophyll concentration was ∼10 μg/ml for CD and absorption measurements and 0.01 μg/ml for fluorescence measurements. The stability of the reconstituted protein was analyzed by recording its CD spectrum at increasing temperatures in the 600–720 nm range. Four measurements were accumulated for the spectrum, and the stability of each sample was measured twice. The absorbance at the peak was 0.75. The temperature was increased from 20 to 75 °C, recording a spectrum every 5 °C, allowing 6 min for temperature equilibration between measurements. The samples were diluted to an absorbance of 0.75 at the maximum in the Qy region. The protein was then illuminated with white light (5500 microeinsteins m−2s−1) from a halogen lamp filtered through a water layer. After each time interval, the cuvette was removed from the light source, and the absorption spectrum was recorded with an SLM-AMINCO DW-2000 spectrophotometer in the range of 600–750 nm. The rate of photobleaching in the absence of carotenoid photoprotection was determined by treating the sample with 5% Triton X-100. When an oxygen-scavenging system (glucose and glucose oxidase (34 mg/ml) and catalase (11 mg/ml)) was used, no photobleaching was observed. When purified from higher plant thylakoids, LHCII preparations bind lutein, neoxanthin, and violaxanthin in a ratio of 1.8:1:0.2, in addition to 7 Chl a and 5 Chl b molecules (TableI), in agreement with previous results (3Connelly J.P. Muller M. Bassi R. Croce R. Holzwarth A.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 281-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 18Bassi R. Pineau B. Dainese P. Marquardt J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). LHCII is the product of Lhcb1–3 genes. These can be overexpressed in bacteria, and the apoprotein refolded in vitro with pigments to obtain a pigment-protein complex (5Plumley F.G. Schmidt G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 146-150Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Giuffra E. Cugini D. Croce R. Bassi R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 238: 112-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar,18Bassi R. Pineau B. Dainese P. Marquardt J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 212: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). We have applied this procedure to maize Lhcb1 cDNA (11Bujard H. Gentz R. Lanzer M. Stüber D.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 6302Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) using a pigment mixture containing Chl a, Chlb, β-carotene, violaxanthin, lutein, and neoxanthin and found that the pigments bind to recombinant LHCII in the same stoichiometry and relative amounts as in the native complex (Table I). We therefore repeated the reconstitution experiment by using individual xanthophylls or a combination of two, rather than the full pigment complement, to verify if the three carotenoids could freely exchange for each other. In addition, we attempted reconstitution with zeaxanthin. For this xanthophyll, in fact, there is considerable debate on its ability to bind to LHCII. In a preliminary experiment, the formation of a pigment-protein complex was analyzed by nondenaturing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In all cases, it was possible to obtain a green band. However, the relative intensities of the bands were not equal, thus indicating differences in the efficiency of reconstitution. With respect to LHCII control samples (hereafter indicated as recombinant LHCII reconstituted using the full pigment set), a significant reduction in the yield of reconstitution was observed when zeaxanthin was used as the only carotenoid during refolding. In the case of neoxanthin, only a very faint band was obtained, suggesting a lower stability of the complex reconstituted with these xanthophylls, whereas violaxanthin and lutein yielded stable complexes with high yield (data not shown).Table IPigment composition of recombinant LHC II complexesSamplePigment mixtureYieldPigment composition (protein)NaN, neoxanthin; V, violaxanthin; L, lutein; Z, zeaxanthin; ΣCar., total carotenoids; tr, trace; /, not available; —, not found.VLZChla/bNVLZΣCar.%Native/////1.41 ± 0.10.2 ± 0.051.8 ± 0.1—3Control161650—+++1.41 ± 0.10.15 ± 0.031.85 ± 0.1—3.0L——100—+++1.41——2 ± 0.05—2.0V—100——+++1.42—2.2 ± 0.1——2.2Vtr100——+++1.450.13 ± 0.022.2 ± 0.1——2.3N100——————//////N981——+1.431.1 ± 0.11 ± 0.1——2.1Z———100+2.3———22L/Vtr5050—+++1.420.13 ± 0.010.6 ± 0.011.6 ± 0.05—2.3L/N50—50—+++1.41.0 ± 0.1—1.9 ± 0.1—2.9N/V5050——+++1.431 ± 0.11.3 ± 0.050.6 ± 0.05—2.9a N, neoxanthin; V, violaxanthin; L, lutein; Z, zeaxanthin; ΣCar., total carotenoids; tr, trace; /, not available; —, not found.

In all cases, the Chl a/bratio obtained was 1.4 ± 0.02, essentially identical to the native complex extracted from leaves. Accordingly, 12 ± 0.3 Chla + b molecules/polypeptide were bound for both the native and recombinant proteins, in agreement with previous results with native LHCII (2Kühlbrandt W. Wang D.N.

This indicates that the differences in the xanthophyll content do not affect Chl binding. The only exception was the protein obtained with zeaxanthin as the only carotenoid. In this case, a Chl a/b ratio of 2.3 was obtained, suggesting that zeaxanthin affected chlorophyll-protein interactions in LHCII. Analysis of the carotenoid composition and stoichiometry showed that reconstitution with the complete xanthophyll complement yielded a protein with 3 bound xanthophyll molecules (1.8 lutein, 1 neoxanthin, and 0.2 violaxanthin molecules) as for native LHCII. This value of 3 was maintained in all cases in which neoxanthin was present together with comparable amounts of violaxanthin or lutein (or both) in the reconstitution mixture. When neoxanthin was absent, only 2 xanthophyll molecules were found bound to LHCII, strongly suggesting that neoxanthin binds to a distinct site, specific for this xanthophyll species, that could not be occupied by other xanthophylls. The value of 2 xanthophyll molecules/polypeptide was obtained when lutein, violaxanthin, and zeaxanthin were present together or alone, suggesting that all pigments can occupy two sites with similar specificity. On the contrary, it was not possible to obtain a reconstituted protein with only neoxanthin, indicating that the occupancy of the neoxanthin site is not sufficient for stabilization of the LHCII complex. Irrespective of the concentration of neoxanthin or of its proportion with respect to lutein or violaxanthin, the number of this xanthophyll species bound to the complex did not exceed 1 molecule/polypeptide, whereas samples with 2 lutein or 2 violaxanthin molecules could be readily obtained. This suggests that neoxanthin does not compete for the two lutein/violaxanthin sites. It is interesting to note that when small amounts of violaxanthin or lutein were added to the Chla/Chl b/neoxanthin mixture, a stable complex was obtained, although with a very low yield. However, the yield increased with the amount of lutein or violaxanthin added. When the neoxanthin/violaxanthin ratio in the mixture was 100:1, the violaxanthin became limiting, and a complex was obtained binding only 2 xanthophyll molecules/polypeptide: 1 violaxanthin and 1 neoxanthin molecule. Although it was possible to reconstitute a complex binding only violaxanthin (2 molecules/polypeptide) when both lutein and violaxanthin were present in the same amount (1:1) in the reconstitution mixture, the complex obtained bound 2.7 times more lutein than violaxanthin. When the ratio was 3:1, the amount of lutein bound was 9 times higher than that of violaxanthin (Table I). Fluorescence emission spectroscopy was used to probe energy transfer within the recombinant proteins. Fluorescence emission spectra were essentially identical (one major emission at 682 nm), irrespective of whether Chl a, Chl b, and xanthophylls were excited at 440, 475, and 500 nm respectively. This indicates an efficient energy transfer and equilibration between all pigments bound. Since energy transfer to Chl a, especially in the case of carotenoids, is strongly dependent on chromophore-chromophore distance and orientation (23Koyama Y. Kuki M. Andersson P.O. Gillbro T. Photochem. Photobiol. 1996; 63: 243-256Crossref Scopus (178) Google Scholar), this result suggests that protein folding is very similar, if not identical, to the LHCII control. The only exception to this pattern was the LHCII zeaxanthin sample: the fluorescence emission spectrum strongly depended on the excitation wavelength, and part of the Chl b was incompetent for energy transfer with Chla as shown by the direct Chl b emission at 660 nm. This was also the case for a Chl a subset that emitted at shorter wavelengths with respect to the LHCII control sample, whereas the Chl a emission excited by Chl b (475 nm) or xanthophyll (500 nm) wavelengths was red-shifted by several nanometers (Fig. 2 E). The absorption spectra of selected recombinant proteins are shown in Fig. 3. Changes in the absorption spectra were detected not only in the Soret region, where the xanthophylls absorb, but also in the Qy region, where only Chl absorption is expected. Difference absorption spectra are shown in Fig. 4 (A andB).Figure 4Difference spectra between the LHCII control and LHCII proteins with different xanthophyll composition.

Gillbro T. Ferguson L. Cogdell R.J. Photochem. Photobiol. 1991; 54: 353-360Crossref Scopus (156) Google Scholar) and that the absorption peaks of these protein-bound molecules are shifted toward lower energy with respect to those in organic solvent. However, the actual absorption of xanthophylls in native LHCII proteins is difficult to determine due to superposition of the Chl a, Chl b, and xanthophyll transitions. The availability of recombinant LHCII proteins that bind a single carotenoid species allows for the determination of the energy level of the red-most S0 → S2 transition of individual xanthophyll molecules within LHCII proteins by second derivative analysis of the difference spectra of LHCII control minus single xanthophyll LHCII proteins (Fig. 5). The values determined for the red-most transition of lutein, violaxanthin, neoxanthin, and zeaxanthin were 495, 492, 488, and 501 nm, respectively. Since the corresponding values in 80% acetone are 477.2, 472.8, 468.4, and 481.6 nm, it follows that the protein microenvironment causes a red shift of 18–20 nm upon xanthophyll absorption. The difference spectra between the LHCII control and single xanthophyll proteins in the 600–720 nm range are shown in Fig. 4 (A and B). In the 630–660 nm range, corresponding to Chl b absorption (19Pagano A. Cinque G. Bassi R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17154-17165Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 21Giuffra E. Zucchelli G. Sandonà D. Croce R. Cugini D. Garlaschi F.M. Bassi R. Jennings R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12984-12993Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), LHCII lutein showed a strong decrease in the amplitude of the 652 nm peak, whereas the 640 nm absorption component was slightly increased. Differences were also observed in the Chl a absorption region (660–684 nm), where the amplitude of the 677 nm transition was decreased, whereas higher absorption was observed at 663 nm. Similar results were obtained in the case of the LHCII violaxanthin and LHCII lutein/violaxanthin proteins, although the effects were of lower magnitude. When neoxanthin was present, proteins had spectra similar to that of the LHCII control with respect to the amplitude of the 652 nm Chl b peak. Nevertheless, small differences either in the Chl a or Chl b region could be detected. In the case of the complex binding 1 violaxanthin and 1 neoxanthin molecule/polypeptide, with respect to the LHCII control, a shift of a 678 nm absorption component to 666 nm was observed. In the Chla region, the absorption in the Chl b region was almost unaffected. The major changes in absorption as detected by difference spectral analysis are reported in TableII.Table IISummary of positive and negative components obtained from difference absorption spectra of the recombinant LHCII proteinsSoretQy+−+−nmnmCT-L437, 490651.2, 677640, 664, 686.4CT-V440, 488653.2, 677640, 668, 686CT-L/V440, 490652, 680640, 666CT-N432, 460, 494447678.4666.4CT-L/N648685CT-N/V467653, 684666, 676CT-Z434, 490516.8651, 676664.4, 687.2a CT, L, lutein; V, violaxanthin; N, neoxanthin; Z, zeaxanthin. Open table in a new tab a CT, L, lutein; V, violaxanthin; N, neoxanthin; Z, zeaxanthin. The CD spectra for the complexes are reported in Fig.6. Clear differences in peak shape are observed in the Soret region. The typical CD spectrum of the LHCII control shows a major negative signal at 491 nm and a shoulder at 474 nm, in agreement with a previous report on LHCII in the monomeric state (25Bassi R. Silvestri M. Dainese P. Giacometti G.M. Moya I. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B. Biol. 1991; 6: 381-394Google Scholar). In the case of the complex reconstituted with lutein only (LHCII lutein), the relative amplitude of these two peaks is reversed, with the 474 nm (−)-signal becoming predominant. A similar effect was also observed in LHCII violaxanthin and LHCII lutein/violaxanthin, suggesting that the amplitude of the 491 nm (−)-signal is enhanced by the presence of neoxanthin in the LHCII complex. Accordingly, the CD spectra of LHCII lutein/neoxanthin and LHCII neoxanthin/violaxanthin have a shape more closely resembling that of the LHCII control. Differences were also observed in the 600–700 nm region, where the LHCII control shows negative signals at 650 and 682 nm and a positive signal at 668 nm. The 650 nm (−)-signal and the 668 nm (+)-signal are due, at least in part, to a Chl a-b excitonic interaction (26Ide J.P. Klug D.R. Kuhlbrandt W. Giorgi L.B. Porter G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 893: 349-364Crossref Scopus (113) Google Scholar) as supported by their concomitant change in amplitude among different samples (Fig. 6). In addition, the amplitude of the 652 nm (−)-signal is strongly dependent on the presence of neoxanthin. Accordingly, the 652 nm (−)-signal was reduced in amplitude in LHCII lutein with respect to the LHCII control, whereas it was restored in the neoxanthin-containing samples. The 682 nm (−)-signal was essentially unaffected by the carotenoid composition of LHCII, suggesting that it is mainly due to chlorophyll a alone. The resistance of selected reconstituted complexes to heat denaturation was measured by recording the CD spectra at increasing temperatures. Spectra were registered from 620 to 720 nm, and the unfolding of the LHCII structure was observed as a decrease in the CD signals to a very low level, due to the intrinsic CD of free chlorophyll. Temperature-dependent denaturation measurements were performed on three samples to probe the effect of site occupancy in LHCII on the stability of the pigment-protein complex. In particular, the LHCII control sample (in which all three sites are occupied), the LHCII lutein sample (in which the neoxanthin site is empty), and the LHCII neoxanthin/violaxanthin sample (in which the neoxanthin site is occupied, and one of the two sites (for which lutein, violaxanthin, and zeaxanthin compete) is empty) were examined. The decay of the 652 and 681 nm CD signals was fitted by a sigmoidal curve for these three samples (Fig. 7, A andB). The temperature at which a 50% decrease in the 652 nm CD signal was observed was different with respect to the LHCII control sample. The value for LHCII lutein is ∼5 °C higher (65 °C), and the value of LHCII neoxanthin/violaxanthin (55 °C) is ∼5 °C lower. This observation was confirmed by analysis of the 682 nm signal, although the neoxanthin/violaxanthin sample had a more scattered distribution of the data due to the low amplitude of the 681 nm signal at 10 °C. We probed the photoprotection capacity of recombinant LHCII containing different xanthophyll complements by illuminating the complexes in the presence of O2 with bright light (5"

At 4.2 kelvin, when the transparency was tuned to be high, a dip in the low-bias differential resistance was observed, indicating a proximity effect mediated by Andreev reflection. When the transparency was tuned to be low, signatures of Andreev reflection disappeared and only tunneling conduction was observed. Below ∼4 kelvin, a narrow peak in differential resistance around zero bias appeared superimposed on the Andreev dip, probably as a result of electron-electron interaction competing with the proximity effect."
https://openalex.org/W1979526534,"Satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry shows that the magnitude 7.6 Manyi earthquake of 8 November 1997 produced a 170-kilometer-long surface break with up to 7 meters of left-lateral slip, reactivating a N76 degrees E quaternary fault in western Tibet. The radar interferometric map reveals asymmetric, along-strike displacement profiles between the two sides of the surface rupture, a pattern that cannot be explained with linear elastic theory. This observation suggests that the elastic moduli of the crust in tension and in compression are different because of the presence of cracks in the crust at shallow depth. A model indicates that a ratio of 2 between compressive and tensile elastic moduli can account for the observed asymmetry, a ratio that is consistent with laboratory and borehole measurements."

However, the low-energy excitation near the expected d-wave node region is strongly suppressed. The frequency-integrated spectral weight is confined inside one-dimensional segments in the momentum space (defined by horizontal momenta &cjs3539;k(x)&cjs3539; = pi/4 and vertical momenta &cjs3539;k(y)&cjs3539; = pi/4), deviating strongly from the more rounded Fermi surface expected from band calculations.

Not only do these complex molecules provide a physical barrier to movement of cells into tissues, but the carbohydrate, or glycosylaminoglycan moieties of the HSPG bind and sequester a variety of bioactive proteins, including growth factors, chemokines, cytokines, and enzymes. These several proteins may be retained in complexation with the proteoglycans, or released when the HSPG are broken down, thus providing mechanisms for induction of growth, chemotaxis, and extravasation of a diverse set of cells in normal or disease processes (3Vlodavsky I.

SDS-PAGE (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) was performed under both reducing and non-reducing conditions employing the Tricine buffer system (18Schagger H. Von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar) and 10–20% gradient polyacrylamide gels (10 × 10 cm). After electrophoresis, gels were either stained with silver (19Switzer III, R.C. Merril C.R. Shifrin S. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 98: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (840) Google Scholar) or transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for Western blot analysis. Peptide and protein sequences were obtained by automated Edman degradation in a PE-Biosystems Procise Model 494 protein sequencer. Model 610A Version 2.1 software was employed for data acquisition and processing. Matrix-assisted laser desorption time of flight mass spectroscopy (MALDI-TOF MS) was performed on a Perseptive Biosystems Voyager Elite mass spectrometer. After the cDNA and derived protein sequences for heparanase were in hand, antibodies were raised against peptide antigens taken from various regions of the enzyme sequence. The following synthetic peptides were prepared by conventional solid phase methods:NH2-R273KTAKMLKSFLKAGGEVIGGC-COOHand NH2-V339WLGETSSAYGGC-COOH, from the 50-kDa subunit, andNH2-D105PKKESTFEERSGGC-COOH, overlapping the COOH terminus of the 8-kDa peptide and the segment linking the 8- and 50-kDa peptides. These peptides were conjugated to a maleimide-activated form of keyhole limpet hemocyanin, and the keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptides were injected into rabbits. Verification that the antisera specifically recognized the peptides, proheparanase, and the 8- and 50-kDa polypeptides of active platelet heparanase was accomplished by Western blotting. Chromatography of the crude platelet lysate on a column of heparin-Sepharose yielded a profile similar to that published earlier (7Hoogewerf A.J. Leone J.W. Reardon I.M. Howe W.J. Asa D. Heinrikson R.L. Ledbetter S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3268-3277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Elution of the column with a gradient of increasing [NaCl] led to recovery of all of the heparanase activity in a region from about 0.8–1.2 m NaCl. SDS-PAGE analysis of the resulting fractions revealed no hint of the heparanase on stained gels, but Western blot analysis using antibodies against heparanase peptide segments correlated the presence of a 50-kDa band with fractions having heparan sulfate-degrading activity. A 65-kDa band was also observed by Western blotting of this fraction. The second purification step by size exclusion chromatography gave high resolution of heparanase activity in a peak comprising components of about 20–50 kDa as seen on SDS-PAGE. This peak was clearly resolved from the elution position of chemokines (7Hoogewerf A.J. Leone J.W. Reardon I.M. Howe W.J. Asa D. Heinrikson R.L. Ledbetter S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3268-3277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The pool of heparanase activity from the SEC step was loaded onto the final heparin Hi-Trap affinity column, and the elution profile is shown in Fig. 1 A. A small peak,shaded in Fig. 1 A, was the last to elute from the column, and this peak 5 fraction contained most of the heparanase activity. SDS-PAGE of this peak under non-reducing conditions revealed a high state of purity, with only two species of approximately 8 and 50 kDa, indicated by arrows in Fig. 1 B. Both silver staining and immunostaining with anti-heparanase antibodies showed the presence of the 65-kDa protein in fraction 4, where the low heparanase activity would be consistent with the faint 50-kDa band in this fraction (Fig. 1, lane 4). The overall yield of the purified enzyme (22 μg) was about 6%, with a purification of 160,000-fold over the activity in crude platelet extracts. The specific activity of our purified heparanase was 450,000 units/mg of protein. Microbore RP-HPLC (C4) of the purified heparanase resolved two main peaks (Fig.2 A, 1 and2), corresponding to the 8- and 50-kDa species, respectively (Fig. 2 B). Integration of the areas under peaks 1 and 2 revealed that the ratio of 2/1 was about 6.5/1. This is in close agreement with what would be expected from an equimolar amount of the 50- and 8-kDa species in the purified enzyme (Fig. 1, peak 5). NH2-terminal sequence analysis of the individual peaks gave the sequence: KKFKNST … for the 50-kDa protein; the 8-kDa peptide appeared to be blocked. The 8- and 50-kDa proteins were subjected to cleavage by cyanogen bromide, trypsin, and lysyl-endopeptidase to generate fragments for sequencing. Peptides were isolated by RP-HPLC on a C18 column developed in a standard TFA/acetonitrile system, and individual peaks were lyophilized and submitted for Edman degradation and/or mass determination by MALDI-TOF MS. These peptide sequences served as the basis for data base searches which led, ultimately, to our elucidation of the cDNA and derived protein sequences for human platelet heparanase. Details with regard to the peptide purification and analysis are not included in this paper, nor are data presented for the cDNA determination. This is because three identical cDNA and derived protein sequences for human heparanase precursor were published while our manuscript was in preparation (11Vlodavsky I. Friedmann Y. Elkin M.

Giorgio N.A. Bohlen P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), and our sequences are exactly the same. For purposes of the present discussion, the protein sequence corresponding to the open reading frame for the heparanase precursor, defined herein as pre-proheparanase, is given in Fig.3. This cDNA codes for a protein of 543 amino acids. There are two Met residues in the signal peptide sequence, Met1 and Met14, and our choice of Met1 as the start site conforms to the previously published sequences (11Vlodavsky I. Friedmann Y. Elkin M. Aingorn H. Atzmon R. Ishai-Michaeli R. Bitan M. Pappo O. Peretz T. Michal I. Spector L. Pecker I. Nat.

Protein Eng. 1997; 10: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (4942) Google Scholar). Most of the primary structure (86%) deduced from the cDNA sequence was confirmed in our laboratory by peptide sequence analysis; these sequences are designated by arrowsand underlining in Fig. 3. The sequence information for the 50-kDa protein placed it at the COOH-terminal region of the pre-proheparanase, extending from Lys158 to Ile543. This is in accord with results of Hulett et al. (12Hulett M.D. Freeman C. Hamdorf B.J. Baker R.T. Harris M.J. Parish C.R. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). The blocked 8-kDa peptide (∼0.5 μg) was hydrolyzed overnight with 1 milliunit of Pfu pyroglutamate aminopeptidase, and the resulting protein gave the sequence: Asp37-Val-Val-Asp-Leu. . . . . This placed the 8-kDa peptide in the NH2-terminal region of proheparanase and provided evidence that the signal peptidase cleaved the Ala35-Gln36 bond. The NH2-terminal Gln36 of proheparanase then cyclized to PCA36, thus accounting for the blocked NH2-terminals of the 8-kDa peptide and the 65-kDa proheparanase. To answer the question as to the COOH-terminal processing of the 8-kDa component, purified peptide (Fig.2 A, peak 1) was subjected to mass spectrometry. MALDI-TOF MS yielded two masses of high accuracy and similar molecular weights that were found in a ratio of about 4 to 1 (Fig.4). The experimentally determined masses are in excellent agreement with the predicted masses corresponding to a major peptide (80%) extending from PCA36 to Glu109 (8247.5 Da) and a minor peptide from PCA36 to Lys108 (8118.4 Da). With reference to Fig. 3, the structural organization of preproheparanase may be represented as shown in Scheme FS1.Figure FS1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Edman degradation was performed on all six of the peptides having the consensus sequence for N-linked glycosylation (Fig. 4), and all showed a gap at the positions expected for Asn. This would suggest that all six sites are, indeed, N-glycosylated. The work described herein presents for the first time an understanding of the processing events leading to activation of heparanase and evidence that the active enzyme is a heterodimer. Others who have studied this enzyme have concluded that the 50-kDa protein alone is responsible for activity (11Vlodavsky I. Friedmann Y. Elkin M. Aingorn H. Atzmon R. Ishai-Michaeli R. Bitan M. Pappo O. Peretz T. Michal I. Spector L. Pecker I. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 12Hulett M.D. Freeman C. Hamdorf B.J. Baker R.T. Harris M.J. Parish C.R. Nat.

Parker W. Holzknecht Z.E. Huber N.S. Platt J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1429: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar); no one has reported the presence of the 8-kDa peptide. A number of explanations might be considered here. The 8-kDa fragment stains less intensely on acrylamide gels than does the 50-kDa protein (Fig. 1 B) and, unless one applies a gel system capable of resolving low molecular weight components, it is likely to go undetected, especially at the low levels of protein encountered with heparanase. Moreover, the 8-kDa peptide is NH2 terminally blocked and refractive to Edman degradation, further complicating its identification in a mixture with the 50-kDa protein (12Hulett M.D. Freeman C. Hamdorf B.J. Baker R.T. Harris M.J. Parish C.R. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). Of course, it may be that the more extensive purification protocols reported earlier (21Freeman C. Parish C.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1341-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 22Gonzalez-Stawinski G.V. Parker W. Holzknecht Z.E. Huber N.S. Platt J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1429: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) led to dissociation of the 50/8-kDa complex and that the 8-kDa chain is not required for activity. In our hands, however, the complex survived gel filtration at high ionic strength and in the presence of detergent, as well as two affinity purification steps. Furthermore, it is usually the case that processing of proteins from progenitor molecules does not produce the active entity as a stable complex with its activation peptide, unless that activity is dependent upon the complex itself. An apt example here is procaspase activation, where excision of a peptide bridging NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal polypeptides gives rise to the active 2-chain “heterodimeric” caspase (23Cohen G.M. Biochem J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4146) Google Scholar). These chains remain in tight, non-covalent association, and both are obligate for function, while the bridge peptide is lost. A final, and compelling argument for the importance of the 8-kDa chain derives from cloning and expression of heparanase done in other laboratories. Heparanase activity is easily demonstrated in mammalian cell hosts transfected with full-length cDNA corresponding to the 543-residue pre-proheparanase (11Vlodavsky I. Friedmann Y. Elkin M. Aingorn H. Atzmon R. Ishai-Michaeli R. Bitan M. Pappo O. Peretz T. Michal I. Spector L. Pecker I. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 793-802Crossref PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar, 12Hulett M.D. Freeman C. Hamdorf B.J. Baker R.T. Harris M.J. Parish C.R. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 13Kussie P.H. Hulmes J.D. Ludwig D.L. Patel S. Navarro E.C. Seddon A.P. Giorgio N.A. Bohlen P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 183-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, expression of the truncated 50-kDa protein defined by Lys158 to Ile543 (12Hulett M.D. Freeman C. Hamdorf B.J. Baker R.T. Harris M.J. Parish C.R. Nat. Med. 1999; 5: 803-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar) failed to yield active enzyme, and this led to speculation that the region NH2-terminal to Lys158 may play some functional role in catalysis. Indeed, our results would serve to define this region as the 8-kDa peptide. Considering evidence presently in hand, we conclude that both the 8- and 50-kDa chains are required for enzyme activity, but we lack proof for this assertion. These protein components are easily separated under denaturing conditions on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1) or by RP-HPLC (Fig. 2). Unfortunately, solvent systems that promote protein unfolding are required for dissociation of the chains, and these conditions lead to irreversible loss of enzyme activity. Therefore, a reconstitution experiment with chains separated as shown in Fig. 2 A has not been feasible and, at present, we lack definitive evidence for an obligate heterodimer. Finally, an earlier report from this laboratory suggested that heparanase was a post-translationally modified form of a CXC chemokine, namely CTAPIII (7Hoogewerf A.J. Leone J.W. Reardon I.M. Howe W.J. Asa D. Heinrikson R.L. Ledbetter S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3268-3277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We have not been able to confirm this observation, nor have others who have purified and characterized human heparanase (11Vlodavsky I. Friedmann Y. Elkin M. Aingorn H. Atzmon R. Ishai-Michaeli R.

Acta. 1999; 1429: 431-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Yet, a recent paper by Rechter et al. (24Rechter M. Lider O. Cahalon L. Baharav E. Dekel M. Seigel D. Vlodavsky I. Aingorn H. Cohen I.R. Shoseyov O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 657-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) reported heparanase activity in a CTAPIII fusion protein with cellulose binding domain. Given this observation, the notion of a chemokine with heparanase activity remains a controversial issue.

We have reported previously that inducible expression of the p53 gene leads to the cell cycle arrest both at G1and G2/M in association with induction of p21 and reduction of mitotic cyclins (cyclin A and B) and cdc2 mRNA. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which p53 regulates transcription of the cdc2 gene. Transient transfection analysis showed that wild type p53 represses whereas various dominant negative mutants of p53 increase cdc2 transcription. Thecdc2 promoter activity is not repressed in cells transfected with a transactivation mutant, p5322/23. An adenovirus oncoprotein, E1B-55K inhibits the p53-mediated repression of the cdc2 promoter, while E1B-19K does not. Since thecdc2 promoter does not contain a TATA sequence, we performed deletion and point mutation analyses and identified the inverted CCAAT sequence located at −76 as a cis-acting element for the p53-mediated regulation. We found that a specific DNA-protein complex is formed at the CCAAT sequence and that this complex contains the NF-Y transcription factor. Consistently, a dominant negative mutant of the NF-YA subunit, NF-YAm29, decreases the cdc2 promoter, and p53 does not further decrease the promoter activity in the presence of NF-YAm29. These results suggest that p53 negatively regulatescdc2 transcription and that the NF-Y transcription factor is required for the p53-mediated regulation.

Virol. 1992; 66: 4757-4762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast to the transcription activation by p53, no consensus sequence has been found in the promoters that are repressed by p53. It was initially reported that only the promoters containing a TATA box, but not those containing an initiator element, are repressed by p53 (24Mack D.H. Vartikar J. Pipas J.M. Laimins L.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). This finding, coupled with the known interaction of p53 with a TATA-binding protein and TATA-binding protein-associated factors, suggested that p53 represses these promoters by squelching TATA-binding protein or TATA-binding protein-associated factors, thus inhibiting efficient initiation of transcription (25Farmer G.

However, in at least one case, it has been proposed that p53 represses transcription through interaction with a transcription activator rather than the basic transcription machinery. Repression of hsp70 transcription by p53 is mediated by an interaction between p53 and CCAAT-binding protein (CBF) a transcription activator of the hsp70 promoter (19Agoff S.N. Hou J. Linzer D.I. Wu B. Science. 1993; 259: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). p53 was first shown to mediate cell cycle arrest primarily at the G1 phase. The G1 arrest is, in part, mediated by the p53-dependent activation of negative cell cycle regulators such as p21/WAF1 and Gadd45 (5el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R.

We reported previously that induction of p53 expression in EJ-p53 cells lacking endogenous p53 leads to a cell cycle arrest both at G1 and G2/M in association with induction of p21 and reduction of mitotic cyclins (cyclin A and B) and cdc2 mRNA (30Sugrue M.M.

In this study, we describe our findings that p53 negatively regulatescdc2 transcription and that the NF-Y transcription factor bound to the CCAAT sequence of the promoter is required for the p53-mediated regulation. The EJ-p53 cell line was established previously, in which p53 expression is regulated in a tetracycline-dependent manner (30Sugrue M.M. Shin D.Y. Lee S.W. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9648-9653Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were grown in 10% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium as described (43Puisieux A. Ji J. Guillot C. Legros Y. Soussi T. Isselbacher K. Ozturk M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1342-1346Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). DNA transfection was performed using the CaPO4 coprecipitation procedure (44Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). After 48 h of transfection, cells were harvested, and proteins were extracted by three cycles of freeze-thawing. The protein concentration of each cell lysate was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). In all transfection experiments, β-galactosidase activity derived from either pCMV-β-gal or pMT-β-gal was used to monitor and to normalize the transfection efficiency. CAT and β-galactosidase assays were carried out according to the protocol described by Gormanet al. (45Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). The promoter activities of reporter constructs were assayed by measuring the radioactivity of acetylated forms using a phosphoimage analyzer (Fuji). PCR techniques were employed to generate various derivatives of the cdc2 promoter-CAT fusion construct, starting from pcdc2-PstI provided by B. Calabretta (38Ku D.H. Wen S.C. Engelhard A. Nicolaides N.C. Lipson K.E. Marino T.A. Calabretta B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2255-2259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, pcdc2-PstI, renamed as plasmid pcdc2–937 in this paper, had −937 to +64 of cdc2 promoter DNA fused to the CAT gene on pUCCAT plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI). Two other plasmids with 5′ sequential deletions in the cdc2promoter, pcdc2–764 and pcdc2–568, were identical to pcdc2-PvuII and pcdc2-SspI, respectively, as described by Ku et al. (38Ku D.H. Wen S.C. Engelhard A. Nicolaides N.C. Lipson K.E. Marino T.A. Calabretta B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2255-2259Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The plasmids with further deletions in the 5′-flanking region were generated by PCR with the following oligomers as forward primers: 5′-TGAACTGTGCCAATGCTGGGA-3′ (bp −306 to −286) for pcdc2−306; 5′-TTTTCTCTAGCCGCC-3′ (bp −155 to −141) for pcdc2−155; and 5′-CTAGCCACCCGGGAA-3′ (bp −119 to −105) for pcdc2−119. PCR was performed using a common reverse primer containing a SalI site (underlined), 5′-TCTAGAGTCGACCTGCCAGGC-3′ (bp +20 to +34) was used. The PCR fragments were ligated into theHindIII (blunt ended) and the SalI sites of pCAT-basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). To construct plasmids carrying internal deletions in the cdc2 promoter region, we carried out PCRs using the following primers: 5′-TACCCGATTGGTGAATCCGGGGCC-3′ (bp −52 to −29) for pcdc2−109/−52; 5′-TGAAACTGCTCGCAC-3′ (bp −11 to +4) for pcdc2−109/−11; 5′-TACCCAGCGTAGCTGGGCTCTGAT-3′ (bp −100 to −77) for pcdc2−109/−100, coupled with the common reverse primer described above. The DNA fragments obtained from PCR replaced the promoter region from SmaI (bp −109) to SalI (bp +34) in pcdc2–937. Mutagenesis in the putative protein binding sites was carried out by the overlapping extension PCR method. The PCRs were carried out with two common primers, a forward primer, 5′-GCCAAGCTTAGTGCAGAATC-3′ (bp −932 to −921), carrying aHindIII (underlined) site, and the common reverse primer carrying a SalI site along with two overlapping oligomers containing mutated core motifs (underlined): 5′-GGCTCTGCCAGCTGCTTTGAAA-3′ (forward) and 3′-ATCGACCCGAGACGGTCGACGAA-5′ (reverse) for pcdc2-dCATmt; 5′-GGCTACCCGGGCAGTGAATCCGG-3′ (forward) and 3′-GATGCCCGATGGGCCCGTCACTTA-5′ (reverse) for pcdc2-pCATmt; 5′-CCCTTTAATATTGTGAGTTTGAAA-3′ (forward) and 3′-GGGAAATTATAACACTCAAACTTT-3′ (reverse) for pcdc2-E2F4mt. Nuclear lysates were prepared according to the method described by Dignam et al. (46Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9164) Google Scholar). A double-stranded, in vitro synthesized DNA fragment containing the distal CCAAT motif (−88 to −64) was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Nuclear lysates (5 μg) were preincubated for 30 min at 0 °C with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and unlabeled competitor DNA in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 20 mm KCl, 30 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.25 mmdithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol. The end-labeled probe (about 15,000 cpm) was added and incubated for an additional 20 min at room temperature. The DNA-protein complexes were separated on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE at 15 mA for 2 h. For antibody supershift assay, 1 μg of each antibody specific for the A or B subunit of NF-Y (KB070 and KB090; Accurate), C/EBP (α, β, δ) (Δ198, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), and C/EBPβ (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was included in the preincubation mixture. The DNA sequences of in vitro synthesized oligomers used in competition assay were as follows: 5′-CTGGGCTCTGATTGGCTGCTTTGAA-3′ for distal CCAAT; 5′-CTGGGCTCTAGCCAGCTGCTTTGAA-3′ for distal CCAATmt; 5′-TACCCGATTGGTGAATCCGGGGCC-3′ for proximal CCAAT; 5′-CCCTTTAGCGCGGTGAGTTTGAAA-3′ for E2F4. To examine the effect of p53 on cdc2 transcription, we transfected thecdc2 promoter-CAT reporter construct (pcdc2-CAT) into HepG2 cells with the plasmid carrying either the wild type p53 or its dominant negative mutant form, p53273. In this experiment, we used two control promoters, pSV-CAT and pG5-CAT. pSV-CAT carries the SV40 early promoter and is repressed by p53 (23Subler M.A. Martin D.W. Deb S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4757-4762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, pG5-CAT carries the G5 promoter containing five consecutive p53 binding sequences and is thereby activated by p53 (23Subler M.A. Martin D.W. Deb S. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4757-4762Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Kern S.E. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Seymour A. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Science. 1992; 256: 827-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). Fig.1 A shows the relative CAT activity of the pSV-CAT, pG5-CAT, and pcdc2-CAT in the presence of wild type or mutant p53. The p53 expression decreased the SV40 promoter activity approximately 3.7-fold, while increasing the G5 promoter activity approximately 12-fold. However, the cdc2 promoter activity was decreased approximately 6.7-fold by the presence of p53. The expression of the mutant p53 (p53273) had virtually no effect on the SV40 promoter but decreased the G5 promoter activity more than 10-fold. The cdc2 promoter activity was increased approximately 14-fold by the presence of p53273. We examined the effects of other dominant negative mutants on thecdc2 promoter. Four mutant forms of p53 tested in this study decreased the G5 promoter activity while increasing the cdc2promoter activity as with p53273 (Fig. 1 B). The dominant negative mutants of p53 have been shown to activate transcription of a novel set of genes that are not regulated by wild type p53 (48Dittmer D. Pati S. Zambetti G. Chu S. Teresky A.K. Moore M. Finlay C. Levine A.J. Nat. Genet. 1993; 4: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). This “gain of function” phenotype should be inhibited by double mutations in the transactivation domain of p53 (p5322/23) (49Lin J. Teresky A.K. Levine A.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2387-2390PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 C shows the effects of a triple mutant, p5322/23/281, on the cdc2promoter. p5322/23/281 increased the cdc2promoter activity similarly as with p53281, indicating that the effect of dominant negative mutations, such as p53281, on the cdc2 promoter was not affected by the transactivation mutation (p5322/23) (Fig. 1 C). The double mutant, p5322/23, increased the cdc2promoter activity about 3-fold (Fig. 1 C). To eliminate possible artifacts caused by overexpression of p53 in the cotransfection assay, we examined the cdc2 promoter activity in EJ-p53 cells, in which expression of the wild type p53 gene is regulated by the tetracycline-regulated gene expression system (tet-offsystem) (50Gossen M. Bujard H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5547-5551Crossref PubMed Scopus (4268) Google Scholar). The p53 expression was kept repressed in the presence of tetracycline but was induced upon removal of tetracycline from the culture medium (30Sugrue M.M. Shin D.Y. Lee S.W. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9648-9653Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). In EJ-p53 cells, the SV40 promoter activity was not significantly repressed by p53 expression (Fig. 2). The G5 promoter was activated (data not shown), while the cdc2 promoter was repressed by p53 expression in agreement with the results of the cotransfection experiment. These results suggest that p53 specifically repressedcdc2 transcription. It has been reported that an adenovirus oncoprotein affects the p53-mediated transcription regulation (51Sabbatini P. Chiou S.K. Rao L. White E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1060-1070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52Shen Y. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8940-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 53Yew P.R. Berk A.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). The E1B-55K protein binds to the amino-terminal transactivation domain of p53 and inhibits its transactivation function (53Yew P.R. Berk A.J. Nature. 1992; 357: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar, 54Kao C.C. Yew P.R. Berk A.J. Virology. 1990; 179: 806-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). E1B-19K has been shown to inhibit the p53-mediated transcription repression of the basic promoters containing a TATA or an initiator element but not the transcription activation of promoters containing the p53-binding sites (51Sabbatini P. Chiou S.K. Rao L. White E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1060-1070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 52Shen Y. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8940-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). We examined the effects of E1B-19K or -55K on cdc2transcription in presence or absence of tetracycline (Fig. 2). In the presence of tetracycline, neither E1B-55K nor -19K affected thecdc2 promoter activity (Fig. 2). However, repression of thecdc2 promoter in the absence of tetracycline was inhibited in cells transfected with E1B-55K, suggesting that E1B-55K is capable of inhibiting the p53-mediated transcription repression of thecdc2 promoter. Unlike the basic promoters, E1B-19K did not affect repression of the cdc2 promoter by p53, suggesting that p53 represses the cdc2 promoter in a manner different from the basic promoters. To identify the sequence element(s) needed for the p53-mediated regulation, we analyzed effects of various deletions of thecdc2 promoters in HepG2 cells. The cdc2 promoter activity with deletions up to −109 was increased to a level similar to that with the wild type promoter (pcdc2–937) by the p53 mutant, p53273 (data not shown, see “Experimental Procedures” for construction of the plasmids). However, the promoters with deletion from either −109 to −52 (pcdc2−109/−52) or −109 to −11 (pcdc2−109/−11) showed a significant reduction in the mutant 53-mediated increase (Fig. 3). Two well characterized protein binding sequences are found between −109 and −52: ets2 centered at −104.5 and an inverted CCAAT sequence (the distal CCAAT) centered at −76. Deletion of ets2 (pcdc2−109/−101) had little effect on the mutant p53-mediated increase. In contrast, the site-directed mutation of the distal CCAAT sequence (dCCAATmt) caused a significant reduction (Fig. 3). Mutations in the proximal CCAAT sequence (at −44) and the E2F-like sequence (at −20) did not affect the mutant p53-mediated increase. We examined the effects of the mutant promoters in EJ-p53 cells. In the absence of tetracycline in the medium, the expression of dCCAATmt-CAT was decreased only about 1.3- fold, while pCCAATmt-CAT was decreased by 7.7-fold, which is a level similar to that of the wild type cdc2 promoter (Fig. 3). Taken together, these results suggest that the distal CCAAT sequence located at −76 is necessary for regulation of the cdc2promoter by p53. We performed a gel shift assay to identify the protein(s) interacting at the distal CCAAT sequence. A 24-bp DNA probe containing the distal CCAAT sequence was incubated with a nuclear lysate of HepG2 cells and was analyzed by a nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel (Fig.4). In the presence of a random competitor DNA, poly(dI-dC), several high molecular weight bands were detected. The intensity of the uppermost band (band a) was reduced markedly in the presence of unlabeled DNA containing the distal CCAAT sequence (dCAT). However, the band a was not changed significantly in the presence of unlabeled DNA containing any of the proximal CCAAT sequence (pCAT), E2F4 sequence (E2F4), or mutated distal CCAAT sequence (dCATmt). This result suggests that band acontains a protein(s) interacting specifically at the distal CCAAT sequence. A number of different proteins that bind the CCAAT sequence have been reported: C/EBP isoforms (55Landschulz W.H. Johnson P.F. McKnight S.L. Science. 1989; 243: 1681-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar), NF-Y (CBF or CP-1) (56Dorn A. Bollekens J. Staub A. Benoist C. Mathis D. Cell. 1987; 50: 863-872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar), CBF/hsp70 (19Agoff S.N. Hou J. Linzer D.I. Wu B. Science. 1993; 259: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar), and NF-1 (also known as CTP) (57Santoro C. Mermod N. Andrews P.C. Tjian R. Nature. 1988; 334: 218-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). To identify the protein binding at the distal CCAAT sequence, we performed a supershift assay using antibodies that recognize NF-Y or C/EBP isoforms (α, β, and δ) in the nuclear extract of HepG2 cells (Fig. 4). The antibodies against A or B subunit of NF-Y led to the formation of a supershifted band (bandb) at the expense of band a, while the antibodies against the C/EBP isoforms did not give rise to such supershifted bands. These results indicate that the complex formed at the distal CCAAT sequence, corresponding to band a, contains the heterotrimeric transcription factor, NF-Y. We examined if NF-Y is required for the p53-mediated repression of the cdc2promoter by employing a dominant negative mutant form of NF-YA (NF-YAm29) in which three amino acids in the DNA binding domain have been mutated (60Haupt Y. Rowan S. Shaulian E. Vousden K.H. Oren M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2170-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). It has been demonstrated that the complex with the mutant NF-YA is functionally inactive both in vitro andin vivo (58Jackson S.M. Ericsson J. Osborne T.F. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21445-21448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 59Mantovani R. Li X.Y. Pessara U. Hooft van Huisjduijnen R. Benoist C. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20340-20346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dominant negative mutant of NF-YA was introduced together with either the pcdc2-CAT or pSV-CAT into EJ-p53 cells, and the promoter activities in the presence or absence of p53 (under tet-off control) were determined (Fig.5). The NF-YA mutant decreasedcdc2 promoter activity in the presence of tetracycline, while it did not affect SV40 promoter activity (Fig. 5). In the absence of tetracycline, however, cdc2 promoter activity was not further repressed in the presence of the NF-YA mutant. Contrarily, serum depletion further decreased cdc2 transcription in the presence of the NF-YA mutant, suggesting that the serum depletion represses the cdc2 promoter independently of CCAAT-binding NF-Y. Taken together, these results suggest that the distal CCAAT sequence and its binding protein, NF-Y, are required for the p53-mediated regulation of cdc2 transcription. Recent studies implicated the potency of p53 as a transcription repressor in the tumor suppressor function as well as in apoptosis (51Sabbatini P. Chiou S.K. Rao L. White E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1060-1070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,52Shen Y. Shenk T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8940-8944Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 60Haupt Y. Rowan S. Shaulian E. Vousden K.H. Oren M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2170-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar). It therefore is of considerable interest to identify endogenous specific target genes that are negatively regulated by p53. In this study, we investigated a mechanism by which p53 negatively regulates transcription of the cdc2 gene, which encodes a protein kinase associated with cyclin B (31Draetta G. Beach D. Cell. 1988; 54: 17-26Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 33Pines J. Hunter T. Cell. 1989; 58: 833-846Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). A transient transfection assay showed that cdc2 transcription was repressed by wild type p53, while it was increased by various mutants of p53 in HepG2 cells (Fig. 1 A). We designed two types of experimental setups to verify negative regulation of cdc2 transcription by p53. First, we examined whether the dominant negative mutants of p53 increase cdc2 promoter activity by the “gain of function” phenotype or by interfering with wild type p53 present in HepG2 cells. Mutations in the transactivation domain (p5322/23) was reported to inhibit the “gain of function” phenotype of the dominant negative mutation (p53281) (49Lin J. Teresky A.K. Levine A.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2387-2390PubMed Google Scholar). However, we found that both the p53281 and p5322/23/281 mutants increasedcdc2 promoter activity (Fig. 1 C). Therefore, we suggest that the dominant negative mutants of p53 increase thecdc2 promoter activity by interfering with the repressive effect of wild type p53 on the cdc2 promoter rather than exerting through the gain of function phenotype. Second, we employed EJ-p53 cells to confirm the results obtained from the cotransfection assay in HepG2 cells. The p53 expression in EJ-p53 cells is endogenously regulated by the tet-offsystem (30Sugrue M.M. Shin D.Y. Lee S.W. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9648-9653Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Cdc2 transcription was repressed in cells growing without tetracycline, while SV40 promoter activity was not (Fig. 2). These results indicate that p53 specifically represses cdc2 transcription. In this study, we examined the possibility that the transactivation domain of p53 is required for repression of cdc2transcription. The p5322/23 mutant did not repress the cdc2 promoter. Interestingly, p5322/23 increased cdc2promoter activity approximately 3-fold (Fig. 1 C), suggesting that a heteromeric complex containing wild type p53 and p5322/23 cannot repress the cdc2 promoter. E1B-55K protein has been reported to bind the transactivation domain of p53, thereby blocking its transactivation function (53Yew P.R. Berk A.J.

Our results showed that E1B-55K inhibits repression of cdc2transcription as well as transcription activation of the p53-responsive promoters by p53 (Fig. 2). Although E1B-19K did not affect the p53-mediated repression of the cdc2 promoter (Fig. 2), it was shown to inhibit the p53-mediated repression of the basic promoters carrying a TATA box or an initiator element (51Sabbatini P. Chiou S.K. Rao L. White E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1060-1070Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggest that p53 represses cdc2 promoter activity in a manner different from the basic promoters, in which p53 represses the promoters by regulating the basic transcription machinery. Subsequently, we identified the distal CCAAT sequence as a cis-acting element necessary for the negative regulation of cdc2promoter by p53 (Fig. 3). It therefore is likely that p53 regulates thecdc2 promoter by modulating a CCAAT binding protein rather than the basic transcription machinery. The p53-dependent cdc2 regulation is somewhat analogous to the regulation of the human hsp70 gene by p53 (19Agoff S.N. Hou J. Linzer D.I. Wu B. Science. 1993; 259: 84-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Transcription of the hsp70 gene is repressed by p53 but derepressed by a mutant form of p53 or E1A, an adenovirus oncoprotein. It was suggested that CBF/hsp70, a transcription activator binding to a CCAAT sequence of the promoter, mediates the p53-dependent repression. CBF/hsp70 interacts with the p53 protein or E1A. The p53 protein is able to compete with E1A for binding to CBF/hsp70. It was suggested that CBF/hsp70 complexed with E1A forms an activator, whereas the same protein complexed with p53 forms a repressor. Recently, it was reported that E1A activates the cdc2 promoter and that the CCAAT sequence is necessary for this activation (61Tanimoto A. Chen H. Kao C.Y. Moran E. Sasaguri Y. Padmanabhan R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3103-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Consistently, we found that E1A activated the cdc2 promoter in the presence of the distal CCAAT sequence when EJ-p53 cells were grown with tetracycline (data not shown). However, this activation was abolished when p53 expression was induced in EJ-p53 cells by removal of tetracycline in the medium (data not shown), suggesting that thecdc2 promoter is regulated in a manner similar to the hsp70 promoter. We identified the NF-Y transcription factor as a protein binding to the distal CCAAT sequence on the cdc2 promoter by a gel shift assay (Fig. 4). Based on our observation that the p53-dependent cdc2 repression is abolished by expression of the dominant negative mutant form of NF-YA, it is postulated that a functional form of NF-Y is necessary for the p53-mediatedcdc2 repression (Fig. 5). Recently, a 110-kDa protein (CBF/cdc2) was identified to interact with the CCAAT sequence of thecdc2 promoter, and the 110-kDa protein is similar or related to CBF/hsp70 (61Tanimoto A. Chen H. Kao C.Y. Moran E. Sasaguri Y. Padmanabhan R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3103-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The protein complexes interacting with the CCAAT sequences of the cdc2 or hsp70 promoter exhibit the same mobility on the polyacrylamide gel (61Tanimoto A. Chen H. Kao C.Y. Moran E. Sasaguri Y. Padmanabhan R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3103-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The CCAAT sequences could compete with each other for binding of the CBF in a cross-competition experiment (61Tanimoto A. Chen H. Kao C.Y. Moran E. Sasaguri Y. Padmanabhan R. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 3103-3114Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Furthermore, NF-Y also bound to the CCAAT sequence on the hsp70 promoter. 2H.-D. Chae, J. Yun, and D. Y. Shin, unpublished data. These results suggest that both CBF/hsp70 and NF-Y bind to the CCAAT sequences in both the cdc2 and hsp70 promoters. Since p53 interacts with CBF/hsp70, this interaction may affect the transactivation ability of NF-Y. Further studies are required to elucidate a detailed mechanism by which p53 regulates the CCAAT-binding protein complex.

https://openalex.org/W2043033643,"Mitochondrial porin, or voltage-dependent anion channel, is a pore-forming protein first discovered in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Later investigations have provided indications for its presence also in other cellular membranes, including the plasma membrane, and in caveolae. This extra-mitochondrial localization is debated and no clear-cut conclusion has been reached up to now. In this work, we used biochemical and electrophysiological techniques to detect and characterize porin within isolated caveolae and caveolae-like domains (low density Triton-insoluble fractions). A new procedure was used to isolate porin from plasma membrane. The outer surface of cultured CEM cells was biotinylated by an impermeable reagent. Low density Triton-insoluble fractions were prepared from the labeled cells and used as starting material to purify a biotinylated protein with the same electrophoretic mobility and immunoreactivity of mitochondrial porin. In planar bilayers, the porin from these sources formed slightly anion-selective pores with properties indistinguishable from those of mitochondrial porin. This work thus provides a strong indication of the presence of porin in the plasma membrane, and specifically in caveolae and caveolae-like domains."
https://openalex.org/W1971585330,"A lateral moraine band on Mount Waesche, a volcanic nunatak in Marie Byrd Land, provides estimates of past ice sheet surface elevations in West Antarctica. Helium-3 and chlorine-36 surface exposure ages indicate that the proximal part of the moraine, up to 45 meters above the present ice surface, was deposited about 10,000 years ago, substantially later than the maximum ice extent in the Ross Embayment. The upper distal part of the moraine may record multiple earlier ice sheet high stands. A nonequilibrium ice sheet model predicts a delay of several thousand years in maximum ice levels at Mount Waesche relative to the maximum ice extent in the Ross Sea. The glacial geologic evidence, coupled with the ice sheet model, indicates that the contribution of the Ross Sea sector of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet to Holocene sea level rise was only about 3 meters. These results eliminate West Antarctic ice as the principle source of the large meltwater pulse during the early Holocene."

However, the role of JNK activation in tumor promotion is not yet defined. Because previous studies have indicated that exposure of JB6 Cl 41 cells to either 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) results in cell transformation, we investigated the role of JNKs in this biological process by using dominant negative JNK1 and the cell transformation model JB6 Cl 41 cells. Incubation of Cl 41 cells with TNF-α led to cell transformation and activation of JNKs. Introduction of the dominant negative mutant of JNK1 into JB6 Cl 41 cells specifically inhibited TNF-α-induced activation of JNKs, but not Erks and p38 kinases. Most importantly, expressing dominant negative mutant JNK1 inhibited TNF-α-induced cell transformation but not TPA-induced cell transformation.

Furthermore, it was demonstrated that UV irradiation can activate JNKs in the absence of JNK kinase (33Nishina H. Fischer K.D. Radvanyi L. Shahinian A. Hakem R. Rubie E.A. Bernstein A. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Penninger J.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), suggesting that activation of JNKs by UV irradiation may be through a pathway that differs from the pathway described previously (33Nishina H. Fischer K.D. Radvanyi L. Shahinian A. Hakem R. Rubie E.A. Bernstein A. Mak T.W. Woodgett J.R. Penninger J.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 350-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Although we learned a great deal about the pathways of JNKs, little is known about their biological function, especially in tumor promotion. Some studies indicated that JNK activation is responsible for triggering apoptosis in response to different chemical agents (34Van Dam H. Wilhelm D. Herr I. Steffen A. Herrlich P. Angel P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1798-1811Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar,35Yu R. Shtil A.A. Tan T.H. Roninson I.B. Kong A.N. Cancer Lett. 1996; 107: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). JNK activation is also thought to be involved in the induction of cyclooxygenase 2, which plays an important role in the inflammatory responses by catalyzing the production of prostaglandins (36Herschman H.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 125-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (1159) Google Scholar). There is indirect evidence that JNKs may be involved in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (23Xu X. Heidenreich O. Kitajima I. McGuire K. Li Q. Su B. Nerenberg M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 135-142PubMed Google Scholar). However, the potential role for the JNK pathway in cell transformation is still unclear. It is therefore essential to determine directly whether activation of JNK plays a critical role in tumor promotion. Previous studies have demonstrated that in a mouse epidermal JB6 cell line, different tumor promoters, such as TPA, EGF, and TNF-α, induce the formation of large, tumorigenic anchorage-independent colonies in soft agar at a high frequency (21Huang C.

Therefore, this model and a well characterized dominant negative JNK1 mutant (APF) were used to directly investigate the role of JNKs in tumor promoter-induced cell transformation.

Stable transfected Cl 41 CMV-neo mass1 and Cl 41 DN JNK1mass2 were established and described in previous reports (39Huang C. Ma W-Y. Li J. Goranson A. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14595-14601Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To avoid the influence of G418 on experiments, the transfectants were cultured in G418-free MEM for at least two passages before each experiment. Immunoblot for phosphorylated proteins of Erks, JNKs, and p38 kinase was carried out using phospho-specific MAPK antibodies against phosphorylated sites of Erks, JNKs, or p38 kinase (41Huang C.

Antibodies from New England Biolabs were used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Antibody-bound proteins were detected by chemiluminescence (ECL, New England Biolabs). 1 × 104 cells were exposed to TNF-α and TPA in BME agar containing 15% FBS. The cultures were maintained in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 2 weeks. The TPA- and TNF-α-induced cell colonies were scored at 14 days after cells were exposed to TPA or TNF-α. TNF-α plays an important role in the pathogenesis of many diseases and elicits a wide range of biological responses, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, depending on the cell type and its state of differentiation (42Brach M.A. Gruss H.J.

We have investigated the tumor promotion activity of TNF-α in JB6 Cl 41 cells. The results show that exposure of Cl 41 cells to either TPA or TNF-α causes the anchorage-independent growth of Cl 41 cells (Fig.1). The transformation rate of TNF-α is similar to that of TPA, a widely used tumor promoter (Fig. 1). Previously, we and others reported that signal transduction pathways leading to activated protein-1 activation are required for tumor promoter (TPA, EGF, or TNF-α) -induced cell transformation in a JB6 cell model (8Huang C.

It is known that activated protein-1 activation is through activation of Erks, JNKs, and p38 kinase pathways (2Boulton T.G. Yancopoulos G.D. Gregory J.S. Slaughter C. Moomaw C. Hsu J. Cobb M.H.

To study the molecular basis for neoplastic transformation activity by TNF-α, we investigated the effects on MAP kinase signal transduction pathways in our system. We found that exposure of cells to TNF-α caused the activation of MAP kinase, including Erks and p38 kinase as well as JNKs (Fig.2), whereas TPA only induced Erk and p38 kinase activation (Fig. 2). The activation of JNKs and Erks by TNF-α (25 units/ml) only appears in early time points (less than 2 h), whereas p38 kinase showed sustained activation (at least 6 h) (Fig. 2 and data not shown). These data suggest that activation of MAP kinase may be involved in TNF-α-induced cell transformation."

Metallothionein transcription is controlled by cell-specific factors, as well as developmentally modulated and metal-responsive pathways. By using the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans as a model system, the mechanism that controls cell-specific metallothionein transcription in vivo was investigated. The inducible expression of the C. elegans metallothionein genes,mtl-1 and mtl-2, occurs exclusively in intestinal cells. Sequence comparisons of these genes with otherC. elegans intestinal cell-specific genes identified multiple repeats of GATA transcription factor-binding sites (i.e. GATA elements). In vivo deletion and site-directed mutation analyses confirm that one GATA element inmtl-1 and two in mtl-2 are required for transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays show that theC. elegans GATA transcription factor ELT-2 specifically binds to these elements. Ectopic expression of ELT-2 in non-intestinal cells of C. elegans activates mtl-2transcription in these cells. Likewise, mtl-2 is not expressed in nematodes in which elt-2 has been disrupted. These results indicate that cell-specific transcription of the C. elegans metallothionein genes is regulated by the binding of ELT-2 to GATA elements in these promoters. Furthermore, a model is proposed where ELT-2 constitutively activates metallothionein expression; however, a second metal-responsive factor prevents transcription in the absence of metals.

Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 913-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The precise physiological role of MT has not been elucidated. However, evolutionary conservation across many phyla suggests that it serves important roles in cell function. Proposed roles include the following: (a) participation in maintaining the homeostasis of essential trace metals; (b) sequestration of toxic metals, such as cadmium and mercury; (c) acting as a reservoir of essential metals that can be donated to other metalloproteins; and (d) protection against intracellular oxidative damage (2Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8428-8430Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar).Exposure of cultured cells or whole organisms to transition metals, ionizing radiation, heat-shock, or oxidative stress induces MT transcription (1Hamer D.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1986; 55: 913-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Koropatnick J. Leibbrand M. Cherian M.G. Radiat. Res. 1989; 119: 356-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 4Bonneton F.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 592-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Metallothioneins typically occur in multigene families. The mammalian MT family consists of four members designated MT-I to MT-IV (6Liang L. Fu K. Lee D.K. Sobieski R.J. Dalton T. Andrews G.K. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1996; 43: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It has been commented that all organisms express MT or MT-like proteins. However, not all tissues within an organism will express all MT isoforms. Numerous studies indicate that individual MT family members display specific cellular patterns of expression. Typically, MT-I and MT-II genes are coordinately expressed. It has been shown, however, that MT-2A mRNA levels do not increase in response to cadmium exposure in human proximal tubule cells (7Garrett S.H. Environ. Health Perspect. 1998; 106: 587-595PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the human MT-IB, MT-IE, MT-IF, and MT-IG genes varies in a cell line-specific manner in response to transition metals (8Schmidt C.J. Hamer D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 5712-5716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, MT-III is expressed primarily in neurons, although its mRNA is detected in testes and prostate (14Uchida Y. Takio K. Titani K. Ihara Y. Tomonaga M. Neuron. 1991; 7: 337-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar, 15Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. Whitmore T.E. Durnam D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

MT-IV is exclusively expressed in differentiating stratified squamous epithelia (17Quaife C.J. Findley S.D. Erickson J.C. Froelick G.J. Kelly E.J. Zambrowicz B.P. Palmiter R.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7250-7259Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar).Metallothioneins from invertebrates also show highly restricted patterns of constitutive or metal-inducible expression. For example, sea urchin spMTA and spMTB gene expression is limited to aboral ectoderm and embryonic gut and oral ectoderm, respectively (18Wilkinson D.G. Nemer M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 48-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 19Nemer M. Thornton R.D. Stuebing E.W. Harlow P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6586-6593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Drosophila Mtn and Mtogenes are primarily expressed in the midgut (20Durliat M. Bonneton F. Boissonneau E. Andre M. Wegnez M. Biometals. 1995; 8: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 21Silar P. Theodore L. Mokdad R. Erraiss N.E. Cadic A. Wegnez M. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 217-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, inducible transcription of the two MT genes of the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegans occurs exclusively in the intestinal cells of larval and adult nematodes (22Freedman J.H. Slice L.W. Dixon D. Fire A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2554-2564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Upstream regulatory elements and transcription factors that control metal-inducible MT transcription have been identified in a variety of species (2Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 8428-8430Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 23Imbert J. Culotta V. Furst P. Gedamu L. Hamer D. Adv. Inorg. Biochem. 1990; 8: 139-164PubMed Google Scholar). Several models have been proposed describing the regulation of metal-inducible MT expression (24Heuchel R. Radtke F. Georgiev O. Stark G. Aguet M. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2870-2875Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 25Radtke F. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Hergersberg M. Gariglio M. Dembic Z. Schaffner W.

However, the mechanism(s) that regulate cell-specific MT expression have not been extensively examined. Cell-specific expression has been explored in the context of DNA methylation, by using hypomethylating agents such as 5-azacytidine. Correlation between hypomethylation and the stimulation of MT gene expression has been observed for rainbow trout, mouse, and human MT genes (8Schmidt C.J. Hamer D.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3346-3350Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 11Heguy A. West A. Richards R.I. Karin M. Mol. Cell.

Differences in the levels of cadmium-inducible transcription between human MT-IG and MT-IF genes in liver-derived cell lines are correlated with single nucleotide changes in the TATA boxes in each promoter (28Shworak N.W. O'Connor T. Wong N.C. Gedamu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24460-24466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Suppression of mouse MT-III gene expression in organs other than the brain has been attributed to CTG triplet repeats within the promoter. However, the binding of a nuclear protein to the CTG sequence has not been demonstrated (29Imagawa M. Ishikawa Y. Shimano H. Osada S. Nishihara T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20898-20900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).The participation of specific transcription factors has been proposed as a potential mechanism for the regulation of cell-specific MT transcription. A protein that binds in a metal-dependent manner to CCAAT-homologous sequences in the mouse MT-I promoter has been isolated from rat liver (30Aniskovitch L.P. Jacob S.T. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1997; 341: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of this protein is homologous to members of the liver-enriched C/EBP protein family. However, the function of this protein has not been explored in the context of cell- or tissue-specific regulation of MT transcription. We now report on the identification of UREs and a transcription factor that binds to these elements, which control intestinal cell-specific transcription of C. elegans MT genes.C. elegans provides a powerful system for investigating the molecular aspects of cell-specific MT transcription. The developmental and cellular biology of C. elegans is thoroughly understood in exceptional detail (31Kenyon C. Science. 1988; 240: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 32Sulston J.

The timing of cell division and differentiation is invariant, and the developmental lineage of each cell can be traced back to the fertilized oocyte (31Kenyon C. Science. 1988; 240: 1448-1453Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). High levels of evolutionary conservation between C. elegansand other organisms are observed in many signal transduction, gene regulatory, and developmental pathways (34Stern M.J. Marengere L.E.

In addition, stable lines of transgenic nematodes that express reporter transgenes in cell-specific and temporal patterns that mimic endogenous genes can easily be generated (38Mello C. Fire A. Methods Cell Biol. 1995; 48: 451-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (1145) Google Scholar, 39Fire A. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 2673-2680Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Two MT genes, designated mtl-1 and mtl-2, have been identified and characterized in C. elegans (22Freedman J.H. Slice L.W. Dixon D. Fire A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2554-2564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Induction of mtl-1 and mtl-2 transcription, following metal exposure, occurs exclusively in all intestinal cells at post-embryonic stages of development. Furthermore, significant levels of intestinal cell transcription are not observed in the absence of stress (22Freedman J.H. Slice L.W. Dixon D. Fire A. Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2554-2564Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that both tissue-specific and metalloregulatory factors control C. elegans MT expression.Several non-metal inducible C. elegans genes are also expressed exclusively in intestinal cells. These include the six vitellogenin genes, vit-1 to vit-6, the cysteine protease cpr-1, and the gut esterase ges-1(40Spieth J. Blumenthal T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2495-2501Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 41Britton C. McKerrow J.H. Johnstone I.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 42Kennedy B.P.

Multiple copies of heptameric elements, which have the consensus sequence CTGATAA, are present in the promoters of each of these genes, as well as the two C. elegans MT genes (22Freedman J.H.

Biol. 1992; 12: 1652-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Originally identified in the upstream regulatory regions of the C. elegans vitellogenin genes, these elements are believed to be responsible for controlling the transcription of intestinal cell-specific genes (44MacMorris M. Broverman S. Greenspoon S. Lea K. Madej C. Blumenthal T. Spieth J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1652-1662Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 45Fukushige T. Hawkins M.G. McGhee J.D. Dev. Biol. 1998; 198: 286-302PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion or mutation of the heptameric elements, in reporter transgenes containing vit-2, ges-1, or cpr-1 promoters, causes either a loss of intestinal cell reporter gene expression or expression in non-intestinal cells (41Britton C. McKerrow J.H. Johnstone I.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 43Egan C.R. Chung M.A. Allan F.L. Heschl M.F.P. Van Buskirk C.L. McGhee J.D. Dev.

Science. 1991; 252: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar).The nucleotide sequence of the heptameric element is identical to the consensus-binding site for the GATA family of transcription factors (GATA factors). GATA factors constitute a family of structurally related transcription factors that interact with the (A/T)GATA(A/G) consensus sequence. GATA factors are expressed in distinct developmental and tissue-specific patterns, and their involvement in the regulation of cell-specific gene transcription is well established (reviewed in Simon (47Simon M.C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 9-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and Evans (48Evans T. Trends Cardiol. Med. 1997; 7: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar)).Several GATA factors have been isolated from C. elegans: ELT-1, ELT-2, ELT-3, and END-1 (49Zhu J. Hill R.J. Heid P.J. Fukuyama M.

The expression of ELT-2 is restricted to intestinal cells in embryonic and post-embryonic stages of C. elegans development. Immunofluorescence, mutagenesis, and ectopic expression experiments suggest that it is a regulator of intestinal cell-specific gene transcription. Furthermore, the intestine is not properly formed in C. elegans in which theelt-2 gene has been disrupted (45Fukushige T. Hawkins M.G. McGhee J.D. Dev. Biol. 1998; 198: 286-302PubMed Google Scholar). The cell-specific pattern of post-embryonic ELT-2 expression is identical to those of both C. elegans MT genes. Thus, ELT-2 is a potential regulator of mtl-1 and mtl-2 transcription.Analysis of the 5′-regulatory regions of the C. elegans MT genes reveals the presence of two GATA-like elements in themtl-1 promoter and five in mtl-2 (Table I). In this report, the contribution of each of these elements in the regulation of C. elegans MT transcription is examined. In addition, the ability of the ELT-2 transcription factor to bind to the GATA elements in the C. elegans MT promoters (a) and effect MT transcription in vivo (b) is investigated. GATA elements and ELT-2 are required for mtl-1and mtl-2 transcription. In addition, ectopic expression experiments indicate that ETL-2 alone, in the absence of added metal or stress, is sufficient to induce C. elegans MT transcription. Here we report on the roles of GATA elements and the associated transcription factor in controlling cell-specific MT transcription. Data suggest that other factors (i.e. metal sensor) contribute to the metal-inducible expression of the C. elegans MT gene. It has not previously been reported that GATA elements or transcription factors regulate MT transcription. Thus, the results presented in this report provide novel insights into the complex mechanisms that govern the expression of MT genes.Table ILocation of GATA elements in the C. elegans metallothionein genesGeneSequencePositionaPositions are relative to the transcription start site in each gene.GATA1.1mtl-1CTGATAA−290 to −284GATA1.2mtl-1TTATCAGbInverse complement of the consensus GATA sequence. −71 to −65GATA2.1mtl-2CTGATAA−278 to −272GATA2.2mtl-2TTCTCAGbInverse complement of the consensus GATA sequence.−230 to −224GATA2.3mtl-2TTATCAGbInverse complement of the consensus GATA sequence.−101 to −95GATA2.4mtl-2TTATCAGbInverse complement of the consensus GATA sequence. −65 to −59GATA2.5mtl-2GTGATAG −81 to −76a Positions are relative to the transcription start site in each gene.b Inverse complement of the consensus GATA sequence.

Biochem. 1986; 55: 913-951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two models have been proposed that describe how metals induce MT transcription (25Radtke F. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Hergersberg M. Gariglio M. Dembic Z. Schaffner W. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1355-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 26Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1219-1223Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). However, metal exposure alone is not sufficient to activate expression. For example, cadmium accumulates in the prostate of metal-exposed rats, but MT expression is not induced in this tissue (66Ghatak S. Oliveria P. Kaplan P. Ho S.M. Prostate. 1996; 29: 91-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, cell-specific processes are also involved in regulating MT gene expression.A comparison among the nucleotide sequences of mtl-1 andmtl-2, and other C. elegans genes whose expression is limited to intestinal cells, reveals the presence of multiple potential binding sites for GATA family transcription factors (Table I). Because GATA elements are involved in the regulation of cell-specific gene expression in a variety of organisms, they may also participate in the intestine-specific expression of mtl-1and mtl-2. In vivo deletion and site-directed mutagenesis analyses confirm that one of these elements in mtl-1 and two in mtl-2 are required for cadmium-inducible MT transcription (Table IV and Fig. 1).Six families of vertebrate GATA-binding transcription factors, GATA-1 through GATA-6, have been identified. Each has distinct but overlapping tissue-specific patterns of expression. Members of the vertebrate GATA-4/5/6 family are expressed in intestinal cells. The factors may be involved in gastrointestinal development (a) and may regulate intestinal cell-specific gene expression (67Arceci R.J. King A.A. Simon M.C. Orkin S.H. Wilson D.B. Mol. Cell.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) (b). The DNA binding domain of ELT-2 is most closely related to the vertebrate GATA-5 factor (50Hawkins M.G. McGhee J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14666-14671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar).Four GATA factors have been isolated from C. elegans: ELT-1, ELT-2, ELT-3, and END-1. The expression of ELT-1 and ELT-3 is limited to embryonic epidermal and hypodermal cells, respectively (51Page B.D. Zhang W. Steward K. Blumenthal T. Priess J.R. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1651-1661Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 52Gilleard J.S. Shafi Y. Barry J.D. McGhee J.D. Dev. Biol. 1999; 208: 265-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The GATA factor END-1 is involved in the development of the nematode intestine. C. elegans intestinal cells arise from a single progenitor cell, E cell, which is formed at the 8-cell stage of embryogenesis (75Sulston J.E. Schierenberg E. White J.G. Thomson J.N. Dev. Biol. 1983; 100: 64-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (2768) Google Scholar). END-1 is only detected between the 1E and 4E cell stages of development and functions during early intestine formation (49Zhu J. Hill R.J. Heid P.J. Fukuyama M. Sugimoto A. Priess J.R. Rothman J.H. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2883-2896Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The pattern of end-1 expression does not overlap those of C. elegans MT genes. Thus, ELT-1, ELT-3, and END-1 are not likely to be regulators of C. elegans MT transcription.In contrast, Elt-2 protein and mRNA are first detected at the 2E-cell stage and are present in all of the intestinal cells. They are continuously expressed throughout development and in the adult nematode (50Hawkins M.G. McGhee J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14666-14671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The post-embryonic pattern of elt-2 expression is identical to those of mtl-1 and mtl-2(i.e. exclusively in intestinal cells), which suggests that it may be a regulator of MT gene expression.Electrophoretic mobility shift assays, using C. elegansprotein extracts, confirms that nematode protein(s) bind to themtl-1 and mtl-2 GATA elements, which were shown by in vivo mutagenesis analysis to be required for MT transcription (Figs. 2 and 3). In vitro expressed ELT-2 forms a sequence-specific complex with these GATA elements (Fig. 4). These results confirm that ELT-2 binds to the C. elegans MT GATA elements. However, they do not conclusively demonstrate that ELT-2 regulates MT transcription.Ectopic expression of ELT-2 activates mtl-2 transcription in the absence of metal exposure (Fig. 5, A–D). This result indicates that ELT-2 regulates C. elegans MT transcription. Similar results were obtained in studies of the gut esterase gene, ges-1. Embryonic expression of GES-1 is limited to the E cell lineage (42Kennedy B.P. Aamodt E.J. Allen F.L. Chung M.A. Heschl M.F. McGhee J.D. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 890-908Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 46Aamodt E.J. Chung M.A. McGhee J.D. Science. 1991; 252: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). When ELT-2 is ectopically expressed, however, GES-1 is observed in most of the cells in the embryo (45Fukushige T. Hawkins M.G. McGhee J.D. Dev. Biol. 1998; 198: 286-302PubMed Google Scholar).Heat-shock of JF5(hsp-16/elt-2, mtl-2/lacZ) nematodes activates mtl-2 transcription in intestinal cells of embryos at later stages of development (Fig. 5 C) (a); intestinal cells of L1–L2 larvae (Fig. 5 D) (b); and hypodermal, pharynx, muscle, and nerve cells of L3-L4 larvae and adults (Fig. 5, A and B) (c). The pattern, level, and frequency of mtl-2 transcription in nematodes that express ELT-2 in all cell types are significantly different than those observed in cadmium-treated animals. In addition, heat-shock of the JF4(mtl-2/lacZ) strain does not induce significant levels of mtl-2 transcription. These results indicate that ELT-2 alone is sufficient to activate MT transcription,i.e. elevated concentrations of metal are not necessary to induce transcription.Some characteristics of GATA elements and ELT-2 resemble those of MREs and MTF-1. For example, deletion or modification of specific GATA-sequences in mtl-1 or mtl-2 prevents metal-inducible transcription in vivo (Fig. 1). Likewise, deletion or modification of specific MREs will prevent metal-inducible transcription of mammalian MTs (76Searle P.F. Stuart G.W. Palmiter R.D. EXS. 1987; 52: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, data indicate that GATA elements and ELT-2 do not control metal responsiveness. GATA elements and ELT-2 are responsible for determining the intestinal cell specificity of MT transcription. GATA elements are found in the upstream regulatory regions of C. elegans intestinal cell-specific genes including vitellogenins, gut esterase, P-glycoprotein, and cysteine protease (41Britton C. McKerrow J.H. Johnstone I.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 283: 15-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 44MacMorris M. Broverman S. Greenspoon S. Lea K. Madej C. Blumenthal T. Spieth J. Mol. Cell.

The I. van, G. M. Borst P. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 228: 701-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Metal-inducible transcription of these genes has not been reported, suggesting that GATA sequences do not function as C. elegans MREs. In addition, cadmium exposure does not induce the transcription of a GATA element containing intestinal cell-specific aspartic protease. 2J. H. Freedman, unpublished observations. ELT-2 contains a single zinc finger domain; however, mouse and human MTF-1 contain multiple zinc fingers (25Radtke F. Heuchel R. Georgiev O. Hergersberg M. Gariglio M. Dembic Z. Schaffner W.

Its mode of neutralization of endotoxin has remained elusive for the last three decades. Several synthetic peptide mimics of PMB, capable of binding endotoxin, have been made. However, the binding ability alone appears to be a deceptive indicator of endotoxin neutralizing activity as molecules with similar binding propensities could either sequester or opsonize the toxin. Hence identification of additional physical parameters which describe adequately the outcome of PMB-endotoxin interaction become imperative. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) studies reported here show that several mimics of PMB despite exhibiting lipopolysaccharide binding affinities comparable with it but, unlike it, do not sequester the endotoxin. These studies thus provide a striking illustration of the difference in the behavior of PMB,vis a vis its mimics toward the endotoxin lamellae, and define further, in chemical terms, mechanism of the action of PMB and allow us to posit that the design of molecules as effective antidotes for sepsis should incorporate the ability to sequester endotoxin specifically.

Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1974; 235: 109-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 2Galanos C. Luderrzitz O. Rietschel E.T. Westphal O. Int. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 14: 239-334Google Scholar). The treatment for endotoxic shock which is characterized by deranged hemodynamics, coagulation abnormalities, and multiple system organ failure, continues to remain nonspecific and supportive because of the absence of specific interventional strategies (3Fink P.F. Berk J.L. Sampliner J.E. Handbook of Critical Care. 3rd Ed. Little, Brown & Co., Boston1990: 619Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms by which endotoxin (LPS) acts on the target cells are increasingly being understood, which in turn has led to the development of several experimental approaches for treating endotoxicosis. These include sequestration of LPS by peptides or anti-LPS antibodies (4Elsbach P. Weiss J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 5Christ W.J. Asano O.

J. Bacteriol. 1967; 93: 1463-1464Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite these many interventional modalities and the severe side effects associated with the use of polymyxin B (PMB), a cyclic cationic peptide antibiotic, for the treatment of endotoxicosis, it continues to occupy the premiere position in our armamentarium for combating endotoxicosis (3Fink P.F. Berk J.L. Sampliner J.E. Handbook of Critical Care. 3rd Ed. Little, Brown & Co., Boston1990: 619Google Scholar, 4Elsbach P. Weiss J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1993; 5: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Only recently have its mode of interaction with LPS and the structural features involved therein been elucidated (6Novogrodsky A. Vanichkin A. Patya M. Gazit A. Osherov N. Levitzki A. Science. 1994; 264: 1319-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 10Rustici A. Velucchi M. Faggioni R. Sironi M. Ghezzi P. Quataert S. Green B. Porro M.

These and earlier studies have led to the proposal that the asymmetric distribution of the basic and nonpolar groups in polymyxin B impart to it an amphiphilicity that is both necessary and sufficient for its LPS neutralizing activity. That this is indeed the case was proven by a subsequent study with a synthetic linear peptide which exhibits no structural similarity to PMB and in which lysines and nonpolar residues were segregated at either ends of the molecule, endowing it with amphiphilicity sufficient for relatively strong binding to LPS (13David S.A. Awasthi S.K. Wiese A. Ulmer A.J. Lindner B. Brandenburg K. Seydel U. Rietschel E.Th. Sonesson A. Balaram P. J. Endotoxin. Res. 1996; 3: 369-379Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Despite these seeming similarities in the mode of interaction between PMB and other peptides with LPS, binding ability alone appears to be a deceptive indicator of endotoxin neutralizing activity as molecules with nearly the same binding propensities could either opsonize or sequester the toxin (14Elsbach P. Weiss J. Immunobiology. 1993; 187: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 15Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Immunobiology. 1993; 187: 227-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). It, therefore, becomes imperative to identify alternate or additional physical parameters of interaction which may adequately describe the outcome of the recognition of LPS on its biologic activity, as they may aid in the design and screening of molecules with anti-endotoxic activity. These studies are motivated by such a consideration. Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) studies reported here show that several mimics of PMB despite exhibiting LPS binding affinities comparable with it but, unlike it, do not sequester the endotoxin. We, therefore, consider the removal of endotoxin as a good descriptor of the efficacy of the anti-endotoxic activity of a given compound and suggest inclusion of this criteria in the design and screening of anti-septics. PMB sulfate, polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN), and fluorescein-labeled lipopolysaccharide (Escherichia coli, 55:B5) were obtained from Sigma. Diphosphoryl lipid A was a product of List Biologicals. Fluorescein-labeled LPS (FITC-LPS) repurified on a Sephadex G-200 column had 8 μg of fluorescein/mg of LPS and exhibited an emission maximum at 520 nm (excitation 495 nm). Wang resin, Opfp, Fmoc derivatives of amino acids were obtained from Nova-Biochem. All other chemicals used were of the highest purity available. The peptides were synthesized on a NovaSym solid-phase peptide synthesizer using standard Fmoc and Opfp chemistry. After synthesis was completed, the terminal amino group was deprotected from part of the resin. It was then dansylated by flowing dansyl chloride in 10 mm triethylamine at pH 8.1 for 15 min. The peptides were cleaved from thep-hydroxymethylphenoxy polystyrene resin using trifluoroacetic acid containing 5% water (Milli Q, Systems) and 1.5% 1,2-ethanedithiol. The sulfhydral bridge in the decapeptide was introduced according to the method of Shih-Yi et al. (16Shih-Yi L. Geok-Tok O. Kung-Tsung W. Shih-Hsiung W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1252: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Peptides were purified on a reverse phase C-18 high performance liquid chromatography column (acetonitrile:water with 0.1% TFA gradient), and their purity was checked with a KRATOS matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization system. The masses of the cyclic decapeptide, BPI derived 28-mer peptide, and the 23-mer peptide were 1229.9, 3407.9, and 2523.7, respectively, and their N-α-dansylated counterparts were 1258.3, 3642.8, and 2752.5, respectively. The dendrimeric peptide had a mass of 1094.3. Lipid A samples were quantified by the Limulus amoebocyte lysate assay in pyrogen-free water, using LPS from EndosafeTM as the standard according to the method of Yin et al. (17Yin E.T. Galonos C. Kinsky S. Bradshaw R.A. Wessler S. Luderitz O. Sarmiento M.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1972; 261: 284-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Concentrations of the peptides were determined by amino acid analysis using Waters Pico-TagTM systems, whereas that of PMB and PMBN were determined by molar absorbance and weight, respectively (11Srimal S. Surolia N. Balasubramaian S. Surolia A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Fast reaction kinetic experiments in the fluorescence mode were performed on an Applied Photophysics SX.18MV stopped-flow apparatus equipped with ARCON 5000 RISC workstation (Leatherhead, KT227PB, UK). The dead time of the instrument was measured to be 1.2 ms. ForN-α-dansyl-peptide-LPS interactions, the samples were excited at 340 nm, and emission was monitored beyond 420 nm, by using a cutoff filter, at right angles to the excitation beam. All measurements were made in PBS (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, containing 150 mm NaCl) and at 20 °C (± 0.1 °C). All traces are cumulative average of ten successive kinetic profiles. Stopped-flow traces were analyzed for mono- and bi-exponential reactions by curve-fitting using the Marquardt algorithm based on the routine curves. DMPC (1 mm) in 2:1 chloroform/methanol was dried in glass vials under nitrogen and further dried in vacuum for 2 h. PBS, 3 ml, containing varying proportions of lipid A (10–250 μm) was then added to each vial. Vials were then vortexed vigorously for 10 min at 25 °C and sonicated for 30 s in a probe sonicator. Suspension containing liposomes were extruded about 20 times through a 50 nm polycarbonate filters. Liposomes were separated from the unincorporated material by passing through a 25-ml Sepharose CL-6B column. Liposomes with biotinylated phosphatidylethanolamine and lipid A were also prepared as above with final composition of such liposomes being 88% DMPC, 10% lipid A, and 2% biotinylated phosphatidylethanolamine. Alkanethiol HPATM chip was cleaned with octylglucoside, and soon thereafter the liposomes as prepared above were passed over it at a flow rate of 2 μl/min for 30 min and washed with PBS. Flow of liposomes followed by PBS was repeated several times until no increase in RUs was noted. The chip was then washed with a 5-s pulse (10 μl/min) of 20 mm NaOH to remove the multilamellar structures to obtain stable base line. The monolayers thus obtained were washed at a flow rate of 10 μl/min with the running buffer (PBS) for 10 min. The surfaces are henceforth referred to as “lipid monolayers.” Lipid A (1 mg) dissolved in PBS (1 ml), heated at 60 °C for 10 min, and sonicated in a probe sonicator for 5 min was also flown over HPA chip at 2 μl/min for 500 s and washed with PBS for 60 s successively till a maximum of RUs was attained, followed by washes with 20 mm NaOH till stable base line was achieved as described above. The above surface is henceforth referred to as “neat lipid A monolayers.” Biotinylated-phosphatidylethanolamine/DMPC/lipid A vesicles were passed over the streptavidin sensor chip (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 2 μl/min for 1 h followed by a wash with PBS at a flow rate of 5 μl/min for 20 min. These surfaces are designated as “tethered liposomes with lipid A.” Kinetics of the interaction of the peptides were determined by the SPR using BiaCoreTM biosensor system at 25 °C at a flow rate of 10 μl/min for the determination of on-rates. Off-rates were measured in the dilution mode by flowing PBS at 10 μl/min. The rate constants were determined by the nonlinear least squares fitting of the primary sensogram data using the BiaEvaluation, Version 3.0, software. A typical titration involved 15–20 injections at 3-min intervals, 4-μl aliquots of peptide solution into the sample cell (volume 1.344 ml) containing lipid A (50 μm), conducted on an OMEGA microcalorimeter of MicroCal, Inc. (11Srimal S. Surolia N. Balasubramaian S. Surolia A. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 679-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The titration cell was stirred continuously at 400 rpm. The heat values of the dilution of the peptides in the buffer alone were subtracted from the titration data. The resulting data were then analyzed to determine the binding stoichiometry (n), association constant, and the enthalpy change (ΔHb) as described earlier. Recently we have demonstrated that the interaction of dansyl-PMB with LPS/lipid A consists of a pair of kinetically distinguishable association and dissociation reactions (12Thomas C.J. Gangadhar B.P. Surolia N. Surolia A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 12428-12434Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). More specifically, the second phase of the association reaction (k 2) was ascribed to the insertion of the hydrophobic aspects of PMB into the nonpolar interior of the LPS lamellar phase, which as expected is absent for PMBN which lacks the terminal 6-heptanoyl/octanoyl-χ-diaminobutyryl unit (12Thomas C.J. Gangadhar B.P. Surolia N. Surolia A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 12428-12434Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Inevitably, several peptides synthesized for countering endotoxic shock display, unlike PMB, monophasic kinetic behavior as exemplified by the stopped-flow kinetic analyses of the binding of the N-α-cyclic decapaptide (Fig. 1, TableI, and SchemeFS1).Table IKinetic and thermodynamic parameters for the interaction of peptides with lipid A determined by SPR, stopped-flow spectrofluorimetry, and FITC at 20 °CPeptidek 1 × 104k −1K a × 105K b(FITC) × 105m−1S−1S−1m−1m−1II2.4 (2.9)0.084 (0.097)2.85 (2.40)3.2III4.7 (5.1)0.097 (0.131)4.84 (3.92)5.1IV3.6 (ND)0.085 (ND)4.23 (ND)3.9V6.8 (7.1)0.091 (0.150)7.47 (6.40)7.9VI9.5 (9.8)0.076 (0.091)12.5 (11.10)11.6SPR data are from an average of four experiments.

Study of macromolecule-ligand interaction by SPR method depends solely on the mass changes during the reaction (18MacKenzie C.R. Hirama T. Lee K.K. Altman E. Young N.M. J. Biol.

Commun. 1997; : 1625-1626Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Additionally, in SPR the ability to form model membrane assemblies, monolayers, or bilayers incorporating the biologic receptors which mimic the natural environment offer additional opportunities to study, in molecular terms, the surface-associated phenomena. A representative sensogram for the interaction of cyclic peptide, with the monolayers of 5% lipid A incorporated in l-α-phosphatidylcholine, dimyristoyl (DMPC) matrix show rapid increase in RUs (Fig. 1). These changes in RUs correspond to k 1 and k −1of 4.7 × 104m−1s−1 and 0.097 s−1, respectively. Residuals confirm further the monoexponential nature of the reaction (data not shown). The values of k 1 andk −1 for the dansyl-cyclic peptide-lipid A interaction determined by the stopped-flow method and shown as a representative example are 5.1 × 104m−1 s−1 and 0.131 s−1, respectively. Good agreement between the rate constants determined by SPR with those obtained by the stopped-flow experiments lends further confidence to our SPR data (Fig. 1 and TableI). Unexpectedly, however, the SPR analyses of the binding of PMB with lipid A/DMPC monolayers showed a time- and concentration-dependent diminution in the RUs (Fig.2, A). The time-dependent drop in RUs indicates that PMB is able to “take off” some mass from such monolayers. Experiments with monolayers made with DMPC alone did not show any changes in RUs ruling out the interaction of PMB with the phospholipid and its sequesteration from the surface. Conversely, a time- and PMB concentration-dependent drop in RUs from neat lipid A monolayers was also observed (Fig. 2 B). These experiments thus leave us with the inescapable conclusion that, as opposed to other peptides examined, PMB is able to from a specific complex with endotoxin and sequester it. Our failure to observe the initial rise for PMB could be related to alteration of the chemical environment of the surface which causes the signal to drop because of a conformational change in the immobilized surface. Nevertheless, appearance of FITC-LPS in the flow-through of SPR experiments done with PMB and not in experiments with other peptides is consistent with the removal of the endotoxin from the immobilized surface (data not shown). We have also used liposomal preparations containing lipid A (10%) tethered to streptavidin immobilized on the biosensor chip through biotinylated phosphatidylethanolamine (2%) in 88% DMPC and noted that, among the peptides studied, PMB alone manifests a drop in RUs from such bilayer vesicles (Fig. 2 A). This decrease in RUs as a function of time reflects a specific removal of the endotoxin from the vesicles as the liposomes without endotoxin fail to suffer any diminution in RUs. The apparent rate constant for the removal of the endotoxin from the neat lipid A, DMPC/lipid A monolayers and from the tethered liposomes with lipid A are nearly the same (0.042–0.046 s−1), implicating similar mechanisms in a variety of lipid assemblies. The only difference between PMB and PMBN pertains to an absence of the 6-heptanoyl/octanoyl diaminobutyryl group at the amino terminus of the latter. Consequently, PMBN is able to associate only at the interfacial regions of the LPS lamellar phase while PMB, subsequent to such an interaction, is able to penetrate the lamellar assembly primarily through its hydrophobic region at its amino terminus (12Thomas C.J. Gangadhar B.P. Surolia N. Surolia A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 12428-12434Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar,20Vara M. Vara T. Nature. 1983; 309: 526-528Crossref Scopus (165) Google Scholar). This difference alone appears to be responsible for the poor anti-endotoxic activity of PMBN. The cyclic (III), the dendrimeric (IV), the 23-mer anti-endotoxic peptide (V) designed by us, 2C. J. Thomas and A. Surolia, unpublished work. and the 28-mer peptide derived from Bacterial Permeability Increasing (BPI) protein (VI) all lack this important property and hence are unlikely to replace PMB in clinical settings. The mode of endotoxin-neutralizing activity of PMB is poorly understood. There are three possible ways by which it can do so: (i) by altering the organization of the endotoxin in the lamellar phase, (ii) by coating the LPS lamellar phase, and/or (iii) by solubilizing and removing it from the LPS assembly. Our SPR studies show clearly that PMB is very effective in solubilizing endotoxin from its assembly. Conversely, a number of peptides that interact with the endotoxin fail to do so. At this stage it is instructive to consider these SPR data in conjunction with the analyses of PMB-lipid A/LPS interactions by stopped-flow spectrofluorimetry (12Thomas C.J. Gangadhar B.P. Surolia N. Surolia A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 12428-12434Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). As alluded to earlier, the stopped-flow experiments explicitly show that the bi-molecular association between PMB and LPS is followed by the insertion of the hydrophobic parts of the antibiotic in the apolar millieu of the endotoxin lamellar phase which, as expected, is described well by a unimolecular reaction. It, therefore, appears likely that the endotoxin “take off” in SPR experiments is synonymous mostly, if not entirely, with the unimolecular phase of the spectroscopically monitored reaction, whereas the bimolecular phase of the spectroscopically determined reaction (k 1) is kinetically indistinguishable from that determined by SPR by monitoring the interaction between lipid A and the covalently immobilized PMB (21Thomas C.J. Surolia A. FEBS Lett. 1999; 445: 420-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). This also appears quite likely from the fact that, under a variety conditions (such as the variation of PMB concentration), the rate of the removal of endotoxin from lipid A/DMPC and or neat lipid A monolayers or the tethered liposomal bilayers remains invariant. In summary, these studies provide a striking illustration of the difference in the behavior of PMB vis a vis its mimics toward the endotoxin lamellae and define further, in chemical terms, mechanism of the action of PMB which allows us to posit that the design of molecules as effective antidotes for sepsis should incorporate the ability to remove endotoxin specifically."

We demonstrate that β-TrCP interacts specifically with IκBβ, and such interaction is dependent on prior phosphorylation of IκBβ on serines 19 and 23. Interaction with β-TrCP is also necessary for ubiquitination of IκBβ upon stimulation of cells, and deletion of the F-box in β-TrCP abolishes its ability to ubiquitinate IκBβ. Therefore, these results indicate that β-TrCP plays a critical role in the activation of NF-κB by assembling the ubiquitin ligase complex for both phosphorylated IκBα and IκBβ.

May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar). In nonstimulated cells, NF-κB is retained in an inactive form in the cytoplasm by its interaction with the IκB inhibitory proteins. Mammalian cells contain multiple isoforms of IκB proteins of which IκBα and IκBβ are the best studied (1Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar). Upon stimulation of cells by various cytokines, hormones, or growth factors, a signal-transduction cascade is triggered which leads to the degradation of IκBs and release of NF-κB. The released NF-κB translocates to the nucleus where it up-regulates the transcription of specific target genes (1Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar). The signal-induced degradation of IκB proteins is a critical point in the NF-κB activation pathway. The key step is the phosphorylation of IκB proteins at two specific N-terminal serine residues, which leads to their ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (2May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). The kinase responsible for specifically phosphorylating IκB is known as the IκB kinase complex (IKK)1 and contains two catalytic components, IKKα and IKKβ (3Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M.

The IKKs phosphorylate IκBα at serines 32 and 36 and mark it for degradation through the ubiquitin-proteosome system. Mutation of either serine residue makes IκBα resistant to phosphorylation and degradation (reviewed in Ref.2May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). During ubiquitin-dependent degradation, ubiquitin molecules activated by ubiquitin-activating enzyme E1 are attached to specific lysine residues on the target protein by a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), together with a ubiquitin ligase (E3) that is specific for the substrate (10Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6818) Google Scholar). Assembly of polyubiquitin chains on the substrate protein targets it for degradation by the 26 S proteosome (10Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6818) Google Scholar). Recently an F-box/WD40 protein called β-TrCP (β-transducin repeat-containing protein) was shown to be the substrate-recognition component of the ubiquitin ligase responsible for phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination of IκBα (11Kroll M.

Nature. 1998; 396: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). β-TrCP recognizes IκBα phosphorylated at Ser-32 and Ser-36 through its WD40 domain, whereas the F-box motif recruits additional proteins including Skp1 and Cullin to form the Skp1-cullin-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex (16Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). β-TrCP belongs to a growing family of proteins containing F-boxes that are involved in assembling the SCF complex. Aside from the F-box, these proteins have another protein-protein interaction module in their C terminus, namely a WD or leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. These C-terminal domains mediate the interaction of SCF complexes with their substrates and determine specificity of substrate recognition. β-TrCP has been implicated in the ubiquitination of CD4 (through HIV protein Vpu) (17Margottin F.

All these proteins share similar N-terminal inducible phosphorylation sites with the consensus sequence of DSGψX S (ψ represents a hydrophobic residue and X represents any amino acid.). Therefore, the inducible phosphorylation of these N-terminal serine residues is the critical step that allows recruitment of β-TrCP and subsequent ubiquitination of these proteins (16Maniatis T. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 505-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). IκBβ, like IκBα, is also believed to undergo signal-induced phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation (21DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S.

The critical phosphorylation sites are serines 19 and 23 because mutation of these amino acids prevents signal-induced degradation of IκBβ (21DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IκBβ can also be phosphorylated in vitro by IKKα and IKKβ (7Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1841) Google Scholar). However, unlike IκBα, direct phosphorylation of IκBβ at serines 19 and 23 in vivo is yet to be demonstrated (8DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1900) Google Scholar). Instead, one study has reported that serines 19 and 23 of IκBβ are constitutively phosphorylated in unstimulated cells, suggesting that the regulation of IκBβ might differ more fundamentally from that of IκBα (24Weil R. Laurent-Winter C. Israel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9942-9949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Because phosphorylation of IκBβ by the IKKs does not induce a mobility shift in SDS-PAGE, andin vivo labeling experiments have been inconclusive, signal-induced phosphorylation of IκBβ remains to be unequivocally demonstrated. 2S. Ghosh, unpublished results.2S. Ghosh, unpublished results. IκBβ also differs from IκBα in other aspects (1Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4584) Google Scholar, 22Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 23Tran K. Merika M. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5386-5399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, while IκBα responds to all NF-κB inducers, in certain cell-types IκBβ responds only to a subset of them (22Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 24Weil R. Laurent-Winter C. Israel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9942-9949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Also, when stimulated by the same inducers, the kinetics of IκBβ degradation is significantly slower than IκBα (22Thompson J.E. Phillips R.J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Ghosh S. Cell. 1995; 80: 573-582Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar, 24Weil R. Laurent-Winter C. Israel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9942-9949Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The underlying mechanism responsible for these differences is unclear although one possible explanation for the slower kinetics of IκBβ degradation might be lower efficiency of ubiquitination of phosphorylated IκBβ. Understanding the details of the pathway by which phosphorylated IκBβ is ubiquitinated and degraded is therefore important for fully decoding the differential regulation of IκBα and IκBβ. The identification of β-TrCP as the recognition element of IκBα ubiquitin-ligase provides an opportunity to directly test whether IκBβ also undergoes signal-induced phosphorylation and degradation, and whether it is mediated through β-TrCP. We report in this manuscript that β-TrCP specifically interacts with IκBβ in stimulated cells. This interaction requires serines 19 and 23 because mutation of these residues completely abolishes this interaction. We also demonstrate that phosphorylation-induced ubiquitination of IκBβ requires the F-box of β-TrCP, suggesting that both IκBα and IκBβ appear to be ubiquitinated and degraded through the same pathway. Therefore the differential regulation of IκBα and IκBβ is most likely because of differences in other steps in the activation pathway of NF-κB. 293, HeLa, and COS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The anti-flu mouse monoclonal antibody (12CA5) was produced and purified in this laboratory. Anti-flag monoclonal antibody M5 and anti-flag M2 affinity gel were purchased from Sigma. All other antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Protein A-Sepharose was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Total RNA was isolated from HeLa cells using TRIzol™ Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and used for RT-PCR to amplify β-TrCP cDNA with appropriate 5′- and 3′-primers. A FLAG-epitope coding sequence was inserted after the starting codon. The 1.7-kilobase PCR product was subcloned intoBamHI and XbaI sites of expression vector pCDNA3 (Invitrogen) and sequenced. To delete the F-box from β-TrCP, two internal primers were designed to flank the boundary sequences outside of F-box region and used individually with the 5′- or 3′-primers described above to amplify the N terminus or C terminus of β-TrCP. The 500-base pair N-terminal and 1.1-kilobase C-terminal PCR products were then used as templates in the sequential PCR with 5′- and 3′-primers. The resulting β-TrCPΔF was subcloned into BamHI-XbaI sites of pCDNA3, and its sequence was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Subconfluent 293 cells were transfected with 500 ng of pBIIX luciferase reporter construct, along with different amounts of β-TrCP or β-TrCPΔF constructs. The total transfected DNA amounts were equalized with empty pCDNA3 vector. After 36 h, cells were treated with or without 20 ng/ml TNF-α for 4 h before harvest for luciferase assay (Promega). Cells were grown in 10 centimeter plates to 40% confluence and transfected with indicated DNA using FuGENE™ 6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After incubation for 36 h, cells are treated with or without TNF-α (10 ng/ml) for 30 min before being lysed with TNT lysis buffer (200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1% Triton-100) supplemented with protease inhibitors. In immunoprecipitation experiments, cell lysates were incubated with 20 μl of anti-flag M2 affinity gel for 3 h or 10 μl of anti-IκBβ (C-20) along with 20 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 4 h at 4 °C. Immobilized immuno-complexes were washed with TNT three times, boiled in SDS loading buffer, and resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred to Immobilon transfer membrane (Millipore Corp.) and blotted with indicated primary antibody for 3 h at room temperature and appropriate secondary antibody for 1 h. Immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL. Human β-TrCP was cloned using RT-PCR from HeLa cells with primers designed according to the published protein sequence. An F-box deletion mutant, β-TrCPΔF, was generated by deleting the F-box region from leucine 148 to leucine 192 (Fig. 1) (19Latres E. Chiaur D.S. Pagano M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 849-854Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Both wide type and ΔF mutant of β-TrCP were flag-tagged at their N terminus, cloned into the expression vector pcDNA3, and their integrity verified by DNA sequencing and in vitroexpression. We first investigated the role of β-TrCP in NF-κB activation. We transfected 293 cells with β-TrCP or β-TrCPΔF construct, together with a luciferase reporter gene pBIIX-luc, which harbored two NF-κB binding sites in its promoter region.

The F-box motif has been found to be important for associating with Skp1, which in turn binds to Cullin and an E2 enzyme to form a functional ubiquitin-conjugating complex. Therefore the β-TrCPΔF construct would bind to phosphorylated IκB but fail to recruit the other components, thus inhibiting the degradation of IκB and activation of NF-κB. Surprisingly, we also found that transfection of wild type β-TrCP also inhibited NF-κB activation, although to a lesser extent than the F-box deletion mutant (data not shown). The explanation for this observation is unclear, but one possibility is that overexpression of β-TrCP results in the accelerated degradation of some other component that is required for activation and nuclear translocation of NF-κB. To examine whether β-TrCP directly interacts with phosphorylated IκBβ, we conducted immunoprecipitation experiments in transfected cells. IκBα and IκBβ were transfected into 293 and HeLa cells respectively, along with either FLAG-tagged wild type β-TrCP or FLAG-tagged TrCPΔF construct. Cells were incubated with the proteosome inhibitor, calpain inhibitor 1, before treatment with TNF-α. Cell lysates were precipitated with anti-flag affinity gel, and the immobilized immuno-complex was immunoblotted for IκBα or IκBβ. The experiment confirmed that interaction between IκBα and β-TrCP is only observed in TNFα-stimulated cells (Fig.2 A). Similarly, IκBβ failed to associate with β-TrCP in unstimulated cells, but bound efficiently to β-TrCP in TNF-α stimulated cells (Fig.2 B). In both instances, deletion of the F-box deletion did not affect the ability of β-TrCP to interact with IκBα or IκBβ (Fig. 2, A and B). This result is therefore consistent with the notion that β-TrCP interacts with its phosphorylated substrate through its WD domain, and this binding is independent of the F-box. Treatment with TNF-α has been shown to cause the phosphorylation of IκBα at the N-terminal serine residues 32 and 36 (21DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been implied, but not directly demonstrated, that IκBβ is also inducibly phosphorylated on serines 19 and 23 (2May M.J. Ghosh S. Immunol. Today. 1998; 19: 80-88Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar). To ascertain whether β-TrCP binds only to IκBβ phosphorylated at serines 19 and 23, we used an IκBβ mutant, IκBβ19/23 SS/AA, in which serines 19 and 23 were replaced with nonphosphorylatable alanines. As shown in Fig.2 C, IκBβ19/23 SS/AA mutant failed to associate with β-TrCP even upon TNF-α treatment. This confirmed that the interaction between IκBβ and β-TrCP is contingent upon prior phosphorylation of IκBβ at the N terminus. Interestingly, an IκBβ19/23 SS/DD mutant in which the two serines were substituted by aspartic acid, to mimic the phosphorylated state, also failed to bind to β-TrCP or β-TrCPΔF. This experiment demonstrates the stringent substrate specificity of β-TrCP for phosphate groups in the IκB proteins. Similar specificity of interaction had been observed in earlier studies where it was demonstrated that only a phosphopeptide encompassing the IκBα degradation motif, but not a serine-to-glutamate-substituted peptide, could compete with intact IκBα for ubiquitin conjugation (15Yaron A. Hatzubai A. Davis M. Lavon I. Amit S. Manning A.M. Andersen J.S. Mann M. Mercurio F. Ben-Neriah Y. Nature. 1998; 396: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). To directly assess whether β-TrCP is a component of the ubiquitin ligase for IκBβ, we transfected COS cells with wild type or ΔF mutant β-TrCP along with HA(flu)-tagged IKKβ. COS cells appear to lack certain components in the signaling pathways leading to NF-κB activation and hence do not respond to traditional inducers of NF-κB. 3C. Wu and S. Ghosh, unpublished observations. Therefore to help bypass this difficulty, we co-transfected HA(flu)-tagged IKKβ, FLAG-tagged wild type or ΔF mutant β-TrCP, and IκBβ. The IκBβ bound to β-TrCP was analyzed by immunoprecipitation of β-TrCP with anti-FLAG antibody, followed by immunoblotting with IκBβ antisera. Under these conditions, where transfection of IKKβ presumably led to continuous phosphorylation of IκB proteins, multiple IκBβ bands with increasing molecular weights were detected in β-TrCP transfected cells. (Fig.3 A, upper panel,lane 4). In contrast, only a single band corresponding to IκBβ is observed in cells transfected with the dominant negative β-TrCPΔF construct (Fig. 3 A, upper panel,lane 6). Although we could detect forms of IκBβ containing one or two ubiquitin molecules using the IκBβ antibody, we did not observe polyubiquitinated forms under these experimental conditions. Because the levels of polyubiquitinated IκB forms are very low, probably because they are rapidly degraded, we repeated the experiment and exposed the ECL blot for significantly longer periods. Under these conditions, we could detect low amounts of higher molecular weight forms of IκBβ that probably represent polyubiquitinated forms of the protein (Fig. 3 B). To further characterize the higher molecular weight IκBβ immunoreactive bands, we immunoblotted the anti-flag-immunoprecipitated complexes with ubiquitin antibody. In contrast to the immunoblot with the IκBβ antibody, the slower migrating bands were readily detected with the ubiquitin antibody (Fig.3 A, middle panel, lane 4). The explanation for why the ubiquitin antibody detects the higher molecular weight species more readily is probably because of the far greater number of epitopes that are presented by the polyubiquitinated forms. As expected, deletion of the F-box in β-TrCP (β-TrCPΔF) almost completely blocked the formation of ubiquitin-IκBβ conjugates (Fig.3 A, middle panel, lane 6). Therefore in cells transfected with IKKβ, β-TrCP is directly involved in IκBβ ubiquitination. To further confirm that β-TrCP promotes the ubiquitination of IκBβ, whereas the β-TrCPΔF suppresses it, we examined the state of IκBβ in β-TrCP and β-TrCPΔF transfected cells by directly immunoprecipitating IκBβ itself. Transfection of either IκBβ or IκBβ along with β-TrCP does not lead to significant ubiquitination of IκBβ (Fig. 3 C, upper panel,lanes 1 and 2). However, upon activation by IKKβ transfection, IκBβ is polyubiquitinated (Fig. 3 C,upper panel lane 3). Transfection of wild type β-TrCP significantly increased the level of ubiquitination of IκBβ (Fig.3 C, lane 4), whereas cells transfected with β-TrCPΔF failed to generate ubiquitinated forms of IκBβ (Fig.3 C, lane 5). The ubiquitination of IκBβ is dependent on serines 19 and 23 because a mutant IκBβ containing alanines in these positions could not be ubiquitinated (Fig.3 C, lane 6). Therefore these observations are in agreement with earlier results examining the binding of mutant IκBβ with β-TrCP (Fig. 2, B and C). In summary, we report that β-TrCP binds specifically to the inducibly phosphorylated IκBβ and promotes its ubiquitination. Our findings further help establish the role of β-TrCP as a component of the ubiquitin ligase for IκB proteins, and demonstrate that the signal-induced phosphorylation of IκBβ by IKKs is a critical step that precedes their ubiquitination and degradation. Therefore, differences in the regulation of IκBα and IκBβ must be because of differences in other steps in the pathway. For example, it is possible that IκBβ complexes contain an additional regulatory component that determines the rate of degradation of ubiquitinated IκBβ proteins, thus explaining their slower rate of degradation. Alternatively, such an associated regulatory protein may influence the ability of IκBβ to be efficiently phosphorylated by IKK. Finding the answers to these questions remains a challenge for the future. We thank Dr. Dola Sengupta for comments on the manuscript."

In this study, we found for the first time that MSH induces neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Comparison of Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways between MSH and nerve growth factor (NGF) revealed that these pathways are crucial for MSH action as well as NGF. K-252a, an inhibitor of tyrosine autophosphorylation of tyrosine kinase receptors (Trks), did not inhibit the action of MSH, suggesting that MSH action occurs via a different receptor than NGF.

The patterning and specificity of these connections requires neurite extension toward the proper targets guided by the growth cone in response to environmental signals. However, the process that involves signal-induced morphological changes resulting in coordinated cytoskeletal remodeling in the specialized growth cone is poorly understood (1Bentley D. O'Connor T.P. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1994; 4: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). The semaphorins/collapsins are a large family of structurally distinct secreted and transmembrane proteins characterized by the presence of a conserved sema domain of about 500 amino acids (2Tessier-Lavigne M.

Chick collapsin-1 and its mammalian homolog, mouse semaphorin D (MSD)1 (initially named sema III), act in vitro as collapsing factors on growth cones and as selective chemorepellents for subpopulations of spinal and cranial, sensory, and motor axons (5Kobayashi H.

To investigate the mechanism of neural network formation, we identified several novel semaphorins (7Inagaki S. Furuyama T. Iwahashi Y.

Neuroscience. 1999; 93: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). One of them, mouse semaphorin H (MSH) is structurally similar to MSD and acts as a chemorepellent on sensory axons (9Miyazaki N. Furuyama T. Sakai T. Fujioka S. Mori T. Ohoka Y. Takeda N. Kubo T.

To investigate the signaling pathway for secreted semaphorin MSH, we used PC12 cells (a clone derived from a pheochromocytoma tumor of the rat adrenal medulla), which are known to differentiate into neuronal cells in response to NGF. Studies on PC12 cells have demonstrated that a variety of extracellular signals can lead to neurite outgrowth and morphological differentiation. In this cell line, the signaling pathway via the NGF receptor is the most well characterized (11Thomas S.M. DeMarco M. D'Arcangelo G. Halegoua S. Brugge J.S. Cell. 1992; 68: 1031-1040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar, 12Jing S. Tapley P. Barbacid M.

Ligand binding to its tyrosine kinase receptor (Trk) causes activation of Ras-dependent MAPK cascades resulting in cellular differentiation and neurite outgrowth (14Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Tachibana T. Dell K. Hattori S. Yoneda Y. Nishida E. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 239-244PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we have found that MSH induces neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells through a Ras-MAPK signaling pathway similar to NGF. It has been described that the conventional extracellular Ca2+concentration (1 mm) is required for chemoattractive growth cone action, induced by brain-derived neurotrophic factor, acetylcholine, and bradykinin, and also for chemorepulsive action induced by soluble fraction of myelin-associated glycoprotein (15Song H. Ming G. He Z. Lehmann M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Poo M. Science. 1998; 281: 1515-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 16Graness A. Adomeit A. Ludwig B. Muller W.D. Kaufmann R. Liebmann C. Biochem. J. 1997; 327: 147-154Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated whether Ca2+ influx is involved in MSH-induced PC12 cell neurite outgrowth. MSD acts as a chemorepellent on sensory and sympathetic axons via neuropilin-1 receptor (17He Z. Tessier-Lavigne M. Cell. 1997; 90: 739-751Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar, 18Kolodkin A.L. Levengood D.V. Rowe E.G. Tai Y.T. Giger R.J. Ginty D.D. Cell. 1997; 90: 753-762Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). Antibodies against the extracellular domain of neuropilin-1 block the effects of MSD in vitro. However, the chemorepulsive action of MSD can be converted to chemoattraction by membrane-permeable cyclic GMP agonists via the same neuropilin-1 receptor (15Song H. Ming G. He Z. Lehmann M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Poo M. Science. 1998; 281: 1515-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). These findings show that different actions, for instance growth cone attraction and repulsion, can occur via the same receptor. We examined the involvement of neuropilins in MSH action on PC12 cells. In this study, we describe the neurite outgrowth effect of MSH on PC12 cells and the signaling pathways that this action occurs through. NGF (7S) was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. PD98059 was purchased from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA). K-252a and Gö6983 were purchased from CALBIOCHEM (La Jolla, CA). Calphostin C was purchased from Wako (Osaka, Japan). Diltiazem was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. ω-Conotoxin GVIA was purchased from Alomone Labs (Jerusalem, Israel). All reagents were used at concentrations established in literature to substantially block their respective targets. Other materials used in this study were described previously (9Miyazaki N.

PC12 cells, NIH3T3 cells, and 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 0.35% glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, and 100 units/ml penicillin. All cells were grown at 37 °C in 5% CO2. The conditioned media containing MSH-AP, mouse semaphorin E (MSE)-AP, AP or MSD were obtained from NIH3T3 cells and/or 293T cells expressing them and concentrated with Centricon (Amicon) as described previously (9Miyazaki N.

The concentration of the proteins was determined from AP activity assayed at 405 nm, and AP activity was equalized in MSH-AP and AP (19Berger J. Hauber J. Hauber R. Geiger R. Cullen B.R. Gene ( Amst. ). 1988; 66: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were dissociated in phosphate-buffered saline solution followed by incubation at 37 °C for ∼2 min with 0.05% (w/v) trypsin in the same buffer. A single-cell suspension was obtained by trituration of pelleted trypsinized cells, resuspended in DMEM. For culture experiments, 2 × 104 cells or 5 × 103 cells were added to each well of a 24-well plate (Costar) or 48-well plate (Costar) that had been coated with poly-l-lysine. After plating for 1 h, cells were treated with various reagents (PD98059, K-252a, Gö6983, calphostin C, diltiazem, or ω-conotoxin GVIA) at the indicated concentrations. To activate calphostin C, the cells were irradiated with a cool white fluorescent lamp located 20 cm away for preincubation (20Alonso M. Muniz M. Hall C. Velasco A. Hidalgo J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). PC12 cell differentiation was determined by scoring for neurite length. Cells possessing one or more neurites of a length greater than 1.5-fold the diameter of the cell body were scored as positive (21Morooka T. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24285-24288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Each value is the mean ± S.E. for 100–150 PC12 cells sampled from three independent experiments. To determine whether MSH-AP action is specific to MSH-AP, the conditioned media containing MSH-AP or AP were absorbed with anti-AP mouse antibody or normal mouse IgG (control) immobilized on beads at 4 °C for 1 h. After removal of beads, the resulting conditioned media were assayed for neurite outgrowth as described above. To detect phospho-MAPK proteins stimulated by NGF, AP, or MSH-AP, PC12 cells (2 × 105/60-mm dish) were treated with 50 ng/ml NGF, 1 nm AP, or 1 nm MSH-AP at 37 °C for the duration indicated in the text. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm NaF, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/ml pepstatin). Aliquots of the lysates (10–15 μg) from each sample were fractionated on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (0.45-μm pore size Immobilon-P, Millipore). The blots were probed with the phospho-p44/42 MAPK antibody (PhosphoPlus p44/42 MAPK antibody kit, New England BioLabs) at a dilution of 1:1000 in blocking buffer (10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) for 60 min at room temperature. The blots were probed with secondary antibody, horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG, at a dilution of 1:2000 in blocking buffer for 60 min at room temperature. The blots were stained for 1 min using the nucleic acid chemiluminescence reagent (LumiGLO chemiluminescent reagent, Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories) and exposed to x-ray film. Blots were stripped with 62.5 mmTris, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 30 min and reprobed with p44/42 MAPK antibody to verify that the protein levels were uniform. For monitoring intracellular Ca2+ levels, cells were loaded by exposing them to 10 μm (final concentration) Fura 2-AM (Molecular Probes) in the dark at 37 °C for 60 min (22Dyer D. Tigyi G. Miledi R. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1992; 14: 302-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Cultures were then rinsed and perfused continuously in a modified Kreb's solution containing 115 mm NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.8 mm MgCl2, 1.8 mmCaCl2, 13.8 mmd-glucose, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. Fluorescence measurements calculated with a real time image processor, ARGUS-50/CA (Hamamatsu Photonics KK), were shown as 340/380 nm (excitation) ratios obtained from groups of six cells. Measurements shown are representative of at least three and, in most cases, a larger number of independent experiments. PC12 cells were incubated with 1 nm MSH-AP, 50 ng/ml NGF, 1 nmAP, MSD, or 1 nm MSE-AP for 24 h. The majority of PC12 cells cultured with AP, MSD, or MSE-AP showed no neurite growth (Fig.1 A). In contrast, many PC12 cells showed morphological differentiation in response to MSH-AP or NGF. The percentages of morphologically differentiated cells are summarized (Fig. 1 B). MSH-AP induced neurite outgrowth in 85.3 ± 4.7% of PC12 cells, compared with 80.7 ± 3.2, 9.8 ± 2.3, 5.9 ± 2.0, and 6.1 ± 2.6% in the media containing NGF, MSE-AP, MSD, and AP, respectively. When the medium containing MSH-AP was preincubated with anti-AP antibodies, the neurite outgrowth activity was dramatically reduced, whereas the activity of NGF was unaffected (Fig. 1 C). The dose-dependent action of MSH-AP was investigated next. MSH-AP induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1 D). The percentage of differentiated cells reached about 100% at 2 nm MSH-AP. AP as control did not induce neurite outgrowth in the same concentration range. These findings suggest that MSH, but not AP, induces neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, dependent on its specific binding to them. Because it has been suggested that NGF-induced sustained activation of the MAPK pathway is crucial to the neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells (14Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Tachibana T. Dell K. Hattori S. Yoneda Y. Nishida E. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 239-244PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated whether MSH induces neurite outgrowth via sustained activation of the MAPK pathway. MAPK kinase/MEK inhibitor PD98059 was used to block MAPK activation (23Alessi D.R. Gomez N. Moorhead G. Lewis T. Keyse S.M. Cohen P. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 283-295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar). PD98059 markedly inhibited neurite outgrowth activity of NGF in a dose-dependent manner, supporting previous findings (Fig.2 A). MSH-induced neurite outgrowth was also inhibited by PD98059 in a similar dose-dependent manner, suggesting that the activation of the MAPK pathway is critical to the neurite outgrowth activity of MSH. We then used immunoblot analysis with anti-phospho-p44/p42 MAPK antibody to detect activated MAPK in PC12 cells stimulated by NGF or MSH-AP. 1 nm MSH-AP induced an increase in MAPK1/2 activation in PC12 cells within 2 min (Fig. 2 B). This activation reached peak level after 5 min and lasted at least 60 min. NGF similarly stimulated sustained activation of MAPK in PC12 cells as described previously (14Fukuda M. Gotoh Y. Tachibana T. Dell K. Hattori S. Yoneda Y. Nishida E. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 239-244PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B), whereas AP did not cause any significant activation of MAPK. These findings suggest that sustained activation of MAPK is crucial for MSH-induced neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells as well as NGF. Ras activation is upstream of the MAPK pathway in NGF-induced neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. Thus, we investigated whether Ras regulation is involved in the signal transduction of MSH-induced neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells. Dominant-negative Ras overexpressing PC12 cells (PC12Ha RHK cells) and mock cells (PC12Ha XMV cells) were incubated with MSH-AP or NGF. Overexpression of dominant-negative Ras almost completely inhibited MSH-AP induced neurite outgrowth as well as NGF-induced neurite outgrowth, whereas the majority of mock PC12Ha XMV cells showed morphological differentiation in response to MSH-AP as well as NGF (Fig. 3). These findings suggest that Ras activation is necessary for MSH-induced neurite outgrowth in analogy with NGF. Activation of the Ras-MAPK cascade may therefore be essential for neurite outgrowth activity induced by MSH. To investigate whether Trks and their signal transduction are involved in MSH-induced neurite outgrowth, K-252a was used to block tyrosine autophosphorylation of Trks and their downstream signal transduction (24Hashimoto S. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1531-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 25Kruttgen A. Moller J.C. Heymach J.J. Shooter E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9614-9619Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). PC12 cells were incubated with the indicated concentration of K-252a for 15 min prior to MSH-AP addition (Fig.4). K-252a at 100 nm markedly inhibited NGF-induced neurite outgrowth but did not exert any inhibition on MSH-AP induced neurite outgrowth, suggesting that the neurite outgrowth action of MSH is not mediated by Trks. Thus, MSH and NGF actions are mediated by distinct upstream receptors sharing a common signaling pathway via Ras-MAPK cascades. Because activation of PKC stimulates NGF-induced neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells (26Burry R.W. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 53: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 27Kahle P. Mangold M. Kuwahara T. Schubenel R. Hertel C. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 479-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), we investigated the involvement of PKC in the signal transduction of MSH-induced neurite outgrowth. PC12 cells were treated with a PKC inhibitor, calphostin C (20Alonso M. Muniz M. Hall C. Velasco A. Hidalgo J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 76: 93-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) or Gö6983 (28Douglas D.N. Fink H.S. Ridgway N.D. Cook H.W. Byers D.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1448: 439-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), for 30 min prior to addition of MSH-AP or NGF. Both treatments blocked MSH-AP action as well as NGF action (data not shown). 20 nm calphostin C markedly inhibited neurite outgrowth induced by MSH-AP and NGF; 50 nm Gö6983 showed similar inhibition. These data suggest that PC12 cell neurite outgrowth induced by MSH and NGF is dependent on PKC activation. By culturing PC12 cells in 25 mm KCl and 100 nm BayK8644, it has been reported that depolarization-induced neurite growth requires Ca2+ entry via voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels (29Rusanescu G. Qi H. Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Halegoua S. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1415-1425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). To determine whether Ca2+ influx is crucial for MSH-induced neurite outgrowth, two types of Ca2+ channel blockers, diltiazem, an L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, and ω-conotoxin, an N-type Ca2+ blocker, were used (30Doherty P. Ashton S.V. Moore S.E. Walsh F.S. Cell. 1991; 67: 21-33Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Both Ca2+ channel blockers, 100 μm diltiazem (Fig.5 A) and 1 μmω-conotoxin (Fig. 5 B), strongly inhibited PC12 cell neurite outgrowth induced by MSH-AP but did not have any obvious effects on NGF-induced neurite outgrowth. These findings suggest that Ca2+ influx via N- and L-type Ca2+ channels is involved in the signal transduction of MSH-induced neurite outgrowth but not NGF. We next tested whether deprivation of extracellular Ca2+ affects MAPK activation induced by MSH-AP or NGF (Fig.5 C). MSH-AP-induced MAPK activation was markedly inhibited by EGTA treatment, whereas NGF-induced activity was not affected, suggesting that 1 mm extracellular Ca2+ is required for MSH-AP-induced activation of MAPK but not for NGF. To determine whether extracellular Ca2+ influx is induced in response to MSH-AP stimulation, fluorescent ratios of F340/F380 were measured to indicate intracellular Ca2+ levels by a real time image processor using Fura 2-AM following MSH-AP stimulation. The addition of KCl, a postitive control, caused a quick and transient increase in Ca2+ levels (Fig.6 A). Ca2+ levels also transiently increased 1–2 min after adding MSH-AP (Fig.6 B), whereas Ca2+ levels did not increase after adding AP (Fig. 6 C). These findings indicate that extracellular Ca2+ influx in the early stage of the signaling pathway trigers MSH action on PC12 cells. To investigate whether MSH action on PC12 cells occurs via neuropilin-1, neutralizing neuropilin-1 antibodies for the extracellular domain of neuropilin-1 were used. Neuropilin-1 neutralizing antibodies, which blocked MSH collapsing action on sensory growth cones, did not inhibit MSH action on PC12 cells (data not shown). We also used a large excess of MSE to compete with MSH for binding to neuropilins, because MSE have no effect on PC12 cells but binds to both neuropilin-1 and 2 (31Chen H. Chedotal A. He Z. Goodman C.S. Tessier-Lavigne M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 547-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) (data not shown). A 40-fold concentration of MSE did not inhibit the action of MSH on PC12 cells (data not shown), suggesting that MSH probably acts on PC12 cells through unknown receptor distinct from neuropilins. In the present study we have shown that MSH can induce neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Nearly all cells showed morphological differentiation with long neurites in response to MSH. This morphological differentiation appeared to be similar to that by NGF. Then we analyzed the cytoplasmic signaling pathway of MSH action comparing with that of NGF action. The major finding obtained about the signal pathway of the action of MSH can be summarized as follows: (a) MSH-induced neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells was mediated by the sustained activation of MAPK in a similar fashion for NGF. (b) Ras activation was also critical to MSH-induced morphological differentiation of PC12 cells. (c) MSH-induced signaling pathway was independent on the activation of Trks which has been known as NGF receptors (Fig. 4). (d) MSH- but not NGF-induced morphological differentiation of the cells were blocked by two types of calcium blockers. (e) MSH- but not NGF-induced MAPK activation was inhibited by deprivation of extracellular Ca2+. (f) MSH induced a transient Ca2+ influx of PC12 cells. These results imply that the Ras-MAPK signaling pathway was shared between MSH and NGF, but the upstream signaling is apparently distinct between the two ligands. So far several studies have reported that Ca2+ influx links extracellular signals to Ras-MAPK signaling pathway (29Rusanescu G. Qi H. Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Halegoua S.

Science. 1998; 280: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar). In some cases, Ca2+ influx activates Pyk2 and c-Src and results in activation of Shc (SH2/collagen protein) and MAPK (29Rusanescu G. Qi H. Thomas S.M. Brugge J.S. Halegoua S. Neuron. 1995; 15: 1415-1425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 37Dikic I. Tokiwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J.

In other cases, increase of intracellular Ca2+activates several Ras guanylnucleotide-exchange factor (Ras-GEF) molecules, Ras-GRF1 (32Shou C. Farnsworth C.L. Neel B.G. Feig L.A. Nature. 1992; 358: 351-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 33Farnsworth C.L. Freshney N.W. Rosen L.B. Ghosh A. Greenberg M.E. Feig L.A.

Science. 1998; 280: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) and result in activation of Ras-MAPK signaling system. This study indicates that Ca2+ influx is necessary for MSH-induced neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells independently of Trk tyrosine kinase receptors. Thus, it is probable that binding of MSH to its receptor appears to cause Ca2+ influx via voltage-dependent Ca2+ channels followed by activation of Ras-MAPK cascades to induce neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells, although it is unknown what the receptor is for MSH and what links Ca2+ influx to Ras-MAPK. A lag in Ca2+ increase of about 1 min after adding MSH-AP may suggest that any chemical reactions such as phosphorylation reactions are involved in the upstream of Ca2+ and Ras-MAPK signaling cascades of MSH action. Such a lag in Ca2+ level of about 1 min has been also shown when PC12 cells were stimulated with NGF (39Jackson T.R. Blader I.J. Hammonfd-Odie L.R. Burga A.R. Cooke F. Hawkins P.T. Wolf A.G. Katherine A.H. Theibert A.B. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 289-300Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), of which signaling includes tyrosine and serine/threonin phosphorylations (11Thomas S.M. DeMarco M.

Our findings using PKC inhibitors suggest that PKC activation is also involved in MSH-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells as well as NGF-induced neurite outgrowth (26Burry R.W. J. Neurosci. Res. 1998; 53: 214-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). This result supports a significant relationship between MSH signaling and Ca2+ influx. Recently, it has been reported that neuropilins are receptors for secreted semaphorin molecules. MSD acts as a chemorepellent on sensory and sympathetic axons via neuropilin-1 receptor, and MSE similarly acts as a chemorepellent on sympathetic axons via neuropilin-2 receptor (31Chen H. Chedotal A. He Z. Goodman C.S. Tessier-Lavigne M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 547-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). We recently showed that MSH also acted as a chemorepellent on sensory axons via neuropilin-1 receptors (9Miyazaki N. Furuyama T. Sakai T. Fujioka S. Mori T. Ohoka Y. Takeda N. Kubo T. Inagaki S. Neuroscience. 1999; 93: 401-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Song and colleagues (15Song H. Ming G. He Z. Lehmann M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Poo M. Science. 1998; 281: 1515-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar) have reported that cGMP analogues could convert the repulsive action of MSD to attractive via neuropilin-1 receptor. Therefore, MSH can act as a chemoattractant via neuropilin-1 receptors on PC12 cells. The action of MSH may depend on cell types or cell states modulated by second messengers such as cyclic nucleotides. Otherwise, MSH-induced neurite outgrowth occurs via an unknown receptor that is distinct from neuropilins. This hypothesis is supported by the following results: (a) Neutralizing neuropilin-1 antibodies did not inhibit MSH action on PC12 cells. (b) A large excess of MSE, a competitive ligand for neuropilins (31Chen H. Chedotal A. He Z. Goodman C.S. Tessier-Lavigne M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 547-559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), did not inhibit MSH-induced neurite outgrowing action. However, these observations do not exclusively rule out a possibility that MSH action on PC12 cells is mediated by neuropilins, because these do not completely refute the possibility that MSE and MSH would bind separate domains of neuropilins. On the other hand, it has been reported that chemorepellent activity of MSD, which is known to act via neuropilin-1 receptor, is independent on extracellular Ca2+ level (15Song H. Ming G. He Z. Lehmann M. Tessier-Lavigne M. Poo M. Science. 1998; 281: 1515-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar,40Ivins J.K. Raper J.A. Pittman R.N. J. Neurosci. 1991; 11: 1597-1608Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results showing the dependence of MSH-mediated signaling on extracellular Ca2+ concentration may support the idea that MSH-induced neurite outgrowth of PC12 cells is signaled via a receptor separate from neuropilins. The present study indicates a possible physiological role for MSH in effecting changes in cell phenotype through cell-cell interactions. We thank Dr. J. G. Flanagan for the AP-vectors, Dr. M. Tessier-Lavigne for the antibodies to neuropilin-1, and vectors of neuropilins and semaphorin D, and Dr. M. Tohyama and Dr. F. Murakami for encouraging us."

https://openalex.org/W2049842375,"DNA damage and environmental stress activate signaling and induce genes involved in cell cycle and cell death. Expression of the Gadd45 protein is induced following DNA damage and other stress. Gadd45 is believed to play a role in growth arrest and possibly in cell death. The JNK signaling pathway is also activated by some DNA-damaging agents. This activation leads to phosphorylation and activation of transcription factors, such as c-Jun/AP-1 and ATF2, which mediate immediate early gene induction. Recently Gadd45 was suggested to be involved in JNK activation. However, as this suggestion relied onin vitro experiments and ectopic overexpression of Gadd45 protein, we examined whether physiological levels of Gadd45 that are induced following exposure to DNA damaging agents and stress can lead to JNK induction. We found that JNK activation by UV irradiation and anisomycin treatment precedes the induction of gadd45mRNA by these agents. Gadd45 protein induction by methyl methanesulfonate also lagged behind JNK activation. The use of protein synthesis inhibitors suggested that newly synthesized proteins, including the stress-induced Gadd45, make only a marginal contribution to JNK activation. We also found that stresses such as γ irradiation induce Gadd45 and do not activate JNK in mouse fibroblasts. Therefore, stress-induced JNK does not depend on Gadd45 induction."

Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar), implicating Cdc42 also as a likely key regulator mediating signaling pathways to cell nucleus. The molecular mechanisms causing the divergent biological effects in cells by Cdc42 have been investigated intensively. The biochemical model that the small GTPase acts as a molecular switch to transduce incoming signals to downstream effector proteins after being activated to the GTP-bound state is well established (16Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2097) Google Scholar). Based mostly upon the criterion that putative effectors would preferentially recognize the GTP-bound form of the GTPases, a number of candidate effectors of Cdc42 have been unveiled. Initially identified by an overlay assay using the [γ-32P]GTP-bound Cdc42 as a probe (17Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar), a panel of candidate effectors turned out to be a class of novel protein serine/threonine kinases termed p21-activated kinases (PAKs) (18Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Subsequent protein data base searches and biochemical characterizations have led to the discovery of a family of proteins sharing a conserved Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) motif of PAK (19Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), many of which have since been shown to belong to the effector family of Cdc42 upon both in vitro and in vivo examinations (16Van Aelst L.

Two of the CRIB motif-containing putative effectors, PAK1 and Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome protein (WASP), have been implicated in Cdc42-mediated actin stress fiber dissolution and actin-polymerization process, respectively (20Sells M.A. Knaus U.G.

The CRIB motif and the immediate surrounding amino acid residues of these putative effectors constitute the essential p21-binding domains (PBDs) conferring Cdc42 binding activity (52Leonard D.A.

Another candidate effector, IQGAP1, which contains a RasGAP-homology domain responsible for Cdc42 recognition (25Weissbach L. Settleman J. Kalady M.F. Snijders A.J. Murthy A.E. Yan Y.X. Bernards A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20517-20521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was identified by Cdc42-GTP affinity binding approach (26Hart M.J. Callow M.G. Souza B. Polakis P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2997-3005Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and has been shown to contain an actin-bundling activity (27Bashour A.-M. Fullerton A.T. Hart M.J. Bloom G.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1555-1566Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). IQGAP1 has been suggested recently to play a role in connecting Cdc42-signaling pathway to actin-cytoskeleton structures (28Erickson J.W. Cerione R.A. Hart M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24443-24447Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and in regulating E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion (29Kuroda S. Fukata M. Nakagawa M. Fujii K.

A few major issues related to the mechanism of Cdc42 function concern how the incoming signals would further bifurcate from the activated G-protein to specific effectors, where the specificity of functional coupling between Cdc42 and individual effectors is embedded in the structure of the Rho GTPase, and whether the identified putative effectors may truly be involved in mediating a specific cellular function of Cdc42. The switch I region of Rho family GTPases, which includes amino acid residues 32–40 (numbering by the Cdc42 sequences), has been established as a key region required for effector interactions. The switch I region mutants, F37A and Y40C of Rac1 and F39A and Y42C of RhoA, which displayed selective binding patterns toward specific Rac1 or RhoA effectors, have been widely used to rule out potential involvements of given effectors in the respective small G-protein functions (41Sahai E. Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1350-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 42Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A.

However, questions have been raised for these approaches by a recent study showing that certain switch I region mutant may have a dominant-negative effect for the cellular functions of the GTPases (49Schwartz M.A. Meredith J.E. Kiosses W.B. Oncogene. 1998; 15: 625-629Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), possibly because of the involvement of the switch I residues in multiple types of interactions with other regulatory proteins including additional effectors, the GTPase-activating proteins, and/or the guanine nucleotide exchange factors. Previous studies of Rac1 interaction with PAK have suggested that, in addition to the switch I region of the molecule, a distant second and possibly a third region may be required to determine the specificity of the functional interaction (30Diekmann D. Nobes C.D. Burbelo P.D. Abo A. Hall A. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5297-5305Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 31Knaus U.G. Wang Y. Reilly A.M. Warnock D. Jackson J.H. J. Biol.

Recent structural mapping of RhoA interaction with its effectors has also identified multiple regions, the switch I and surrounding residues and amino acids 75–92 of RhoA, Asp-76, Asp-87, and Asp-90 in particular, to be responsible for selective binding to different classes of Rho-binding domains of effectors (32Fujisawa K.

This “second” or “third” effector-interacting region of Rho GTPases may represent the unique site in the GTPase structures contributing to the specificity of individual effector binding. To dissect the mechanism of Cdc42-effector interaction and to compare the characteristics of Cdc42-effector coupling with those of Rac1- and RhoA-effector recognition, we have attempted to map the regions of Cdc42 involved in specifying interactions with three effector targets, PAK1, WASP, and IQGAP1, in the current study. Our results obtained by mutational and chimeric approaches identify three distinct regions required for recognition of the three different effector PBDs. Microinjection experiments carried out with constitutively active Cdc42/RhoA chimeras indicated that, although preserving WASP- and PAK1-binding could retain PAM-inducing activity of Cdc42, PAK1 and WASP were not required for the Cdc42-mediated PAM formation in Swiss 3T3 cells. Moreover, IQGAP1-binding alone by Cdc42 was insufficient for this activity. Thus, Cdc42 utilizes multiple distinct structural determinants to specify different effector binding and to elicit PAM-inducing effect. The Cdc42 point mutants were generated by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of human Cdc42 cDNA in pGEX-KG vector by the polymerase chain reaction-based second extension amplification technique using the Pfu polymerase (Stratagene), with primers that contained the desired mutations (34Li R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4671-4681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The sequences of mutagenized cDNA inserts were confirmed by manual or automated DNA sequencing. The Cdc42/RhoA chimeric cDNAs were produced by polymerase chain reaction method using the Pfupolymerase which generates blunt-ended DNA fragments in PCR reactions. The products amplified from respective cDNAs encoding Cdc42 and RhoA with primers sandwiching the junctional site and the 5′- or 3′-end of the coding sequences containing a BamHI site orEcoRI site were co-inserted into the BamHI andEcoRI sites of the pGEX-KG plasmid as described previously (34Li R. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4671-4681Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 35Li R. Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32830-32835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To generate the constitutively active chimeras, the resulting chimeric inserts were re-amplified using a 5′-end primer containing aBamHI site, ATG start codon, and the coding sequences including a Gly to Val mutation at the amino acid 12 position (amino acid 14 position for RhoA sequences) and an 3′-primer containing the stop codon and an EcoRI site, and were then reinserted into the pGEX-KG vector. These cDNA constructs were further sequence-proofed by automated fluorescence sequencing prior to protein expression. All junctions of the chimeras were chosen at the conserved regions between Cdc42 and RhoA (see Fig. 1). Expression and purification of GST-fusion small GTP-binding proteins and the PBD of effectors from the pGEX-KG vector-transformed Escherichia coli were carried out as described previously (36Zhang B. Wang Z. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21999-22007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 37Zhang B. Chernoff J. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8776-8782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The PBD of human PAK1 contains amino acid residues 51–135, the PBD of human WASP contains amino acid residues 218–288 of WASP, the PBD of human IQGAP1 contains amino acid residues 864–1657 of the native protein, and the PBD of protein kinase N (PKN) contains residues 1–123 of PKN (gift of Dr. Yoshi Ono). All proteins prepared for measurements were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining analysis, and the contents of each were judged to be at least 90% pure. Concentrations of the recombinant proteins were determined by using the BCA protein assay reagents from Pierce with bovine serum albumin as a standard or by [γ-35S]GTP binding for the small GTP-binding proteins (36Zhang B. Wang Z. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21999-22007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The intrinsic and GAP-stimulated GTPase activities of Cdc42/RhoA chimeras and Cdc42 mutants were measured as described previously (35Li R. Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32830-32835Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) by determining the retention of G-protein bound radioactivities on nitrocellulose filters. The binding interactions between the small G-proteins and effector PBDs were examined by a dot-blot assay as described (19Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 35Li R. Zhang B. Zheng Y. J. Biol.

Briefly, 1–5 μg of GST-fusions of PBDs or GST alone at 0.5 mg/ml concentration were spotted onto nitrocellulose filters (BA85, Schleicher & Schuell). The filters were incubated with buffer A containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm GTP, and 5% dry milk for 1 h at room temperature. 0.2 μg of the active small G-protein mutants, preloaded with [γ-32P]GTP, was then added to the buffer mixture and incubated for 5 min at 4 °C under constant agitation. The nitrocellulose filters were washed three times with ice-cold buffer A and were then subjected to autoradiography and radioactive quantification by using an InstantImager (Packard). COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The cDNAs encoding the Cdc42 chimeras were cloned into the pKH3 plasmid with a triple HA-tag at the 5′-end of the initiation codon (61Mattingly R.R. Sorisky A. Brann M.R. Macara I.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7943-7952Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and the cDNAs encoding the effector PBDs were cloned in-frame with the BamHI-EcoRI sites of pCMV6-myc vector which contains a 5′-myc tag sequences (20Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Transfections were carried out using the LipofectAMINE reagent following the instructions of the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were collected 48 h after transfection and were subjected to anti-myc immunoprecipitation followed by anti-HA (12CA5 monoclonal antibody, Boehringer-Mannheim) or anti-myc (9E10 monoclonal antibody, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) Western blotting. Immunocomplexes were visualized by ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) following the secondary antibody (HRP-conjugated anti-mouse Fcγ, Jackson Immunologicals, Inc.) incubation. Swiss 3T3 cells (gift of Dr. A. Ridley) were plated onto Locator glass coverslips (Eppendorf) and cultured for 48 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum. Subconfluent cells were then serum-starved for 16 h prior to microinjection. Proteins were injected in a buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm glutathione, 100 mm NaCl, and 2 mg/ml of Texas red-dextran (Molecular Probes), using an Eppendorf microinjector mounted on an Olympus IMT2 microscope (38Zheng Y.

Successful injections were determined by visual inspection of the cells for fluorescence. All recognizable cells in a given sector of the grid were injected. The injected cells were identified by the sector letter microedged into the Locator coverslip. After microinjection cells were further incubated at 37 °C for 15–20 min followed by fixation and staining with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (Sigma) for filamentous actin as described (38Zheng Y.

Cdc42 is at least 50% identical in amino acid sequences to other Rho family members such as RhoA (Fig. 1) and is about 30% identical to Ras; it shares a similar overall three-dimensional folding with RhoA and Ras (Fig. 1, Ref. 39Feltham J.L. Dotsch V. Raza S. Manor D. Cerione R.A. Sutcliffe M.J. Wagner G. Oswald R.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8755-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). It is intriguing how the relative minor differences in the primary structure of Cdc42 with other Rho GTPases can result in major quantitative, sometimes qualitative, differences with regard to its ability to recognize a different set of effector targets. The mostly expected effector-interaction site of Cdc42 is the switch I domain. The switch I and surrounding residues of Ras protein have been established as an important region for interacting with effector molecules to elicit cellular transformation (40Marshal C.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Recent mutagenesis studies of RhoA and Rac1 have also pinpointed this region as an essential effector site mediating their biological activities, which include the RhoA-induced actin-stress fiber formation and integrin complex assembly (41Sahai E. Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1350-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), the RhoA-mediated serum response factor activation and cell transformation (41Sahai E. Alberts A.S.

Chem. 1996; 271: 19794-19801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Moreover, site-specific mutants of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 at the amino acid 37 and 40 positions (numbered by that of Cdc42) have been in use to delineate the downstream signaling pathways based on their selective binding patterns to certain effectors such as PAK and ROK (41Sahai E. Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1350-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 43Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). To examine the requirement of individual residues of the switch I and neighboring regions of Cdc42 for effector recognition in more detail, we have compared the ability of Cdc42 mutants made at five conserved residues in switch I and at seven nonconserved residues in switch I and immediate adjacent regions (Fig. 1) to bind to the PBDs of the implicated effectors, PAK1, WASP, and IQGAP1. As shown in Fig.2 A, four of the five mutants made at the conserved residues of switch I, Y32K, T35A, F37A, and Y40K, demonstrated a selective binding pattern to the three effectors, whereas V33D does not affect binding to any of the three PBDs. Y32K retained the ability of binding to PAK1 and IQGAP1 while impaired the potential to bind to WASP. T35A, which may have an altered Mg2+ binding property because Thr-35 is expected to contribute directly to the Mg2+ coordination, partially retained the WASP binding ability while lost the PAK1- and IQGAP1-binding activities. Consistent with the previous observations (42Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), F37A was able to bind to PAK1 whereas Y40K was mostly inactive toward PAK1. In addition, these two mutants displayed opposite recognition patterns toward WASP and IQGAP1, i.e. F37A remained capable of binding to WASP but was inactive in binding to IQGAP1 whereas Y40K was active toward IQGAP1 but was inactive for WASP (Fig. 2 A). Further examination of the Cdc42-unique residues in the switch I and surrounding regions by mutation of the Cdc42 residues to the corresponding residues of RhoA revealed that Thr-25, Ser-30, Glu-31, and Thr-43, which are located immediately outside switch I, are not essential for the effector-recognition, whereas the Asp-38 and Thr-43 residues constitute the important elements in PAK1-binding (Fig. 2 B). These results suggest that switch I, and its C-terminal neighboring region in the case of PAK1, is necessary for the various effector binding interactions of Cdc42. The data also provide further support for the previous observations made of the F37A and Y40K mutants (42Lamarche N. Tapon N. Stowers L. Burbelo P.D. Aspenstrom P. Bridges T. Chant J. Hall A. Cell. 1996; 87: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar, 43Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1324-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), that different effectors utilize distinct residues of switch I to make a contact with Cdc42. In the best characterized cases of small G-protein-effector interactions, Ras and Rap1 were found to complex with Raf/RalGDS PBDs exclusively through the switch I and the extended region by forming an intermolecular β-sheet at the contact site (45Nassar N. Horn G. Herrmann C. Scherer A. McCormick F. Wittinghofer A. Nature. 1995; 375: 554-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar, 62Huang L. Hofer F. Marin G.S. Kim S.-H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 422-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Chimeras of Rap1 containing the Ras residues of this region became oncogenic like Ras (46Zhang K. Noda M. Vass W.C. Papageorge A.G. Lowy D.R. Science. 1990; 249: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), suggesting that the switch I and neighboring regions of Ras are sufficient for specifying effector binding and for its biological function. We therefore examined whether the switch I and surrounding residues of Cdc42 are sufficient for specific binding to the effectors. Chimera A, in which the amino acids 29 to 55 of Cdc42 were replaced by the corresponding residues of RhoA, was mostly inactive toward PAK1 while retaining the Cdc42 property in recognition of WASP and IQGAP1 (Fig. 3). Chimera B, which contains RhoA sequences 23 to 31 adjacent to switch I in the Cdc42 backbone, behaved similarly as wild-type Cdc42 in bind"
https://openalex.org/W2063900611,"In this report, we show that desensitization regulates ligand-independent, spontaneous activity of the human B2 bradykinin (BK) receptor, and the level of spontaneous receptor activity determines the action of the BK antagonists and partial receptor agonists NPC17731 and HOE140 as agonists or inverse agonists. Spontaneous receptor activity was monitored by measuring basal cellular phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis as a function of the density of the receptor in transiently transfected HEK293 cells. Minimal spontaneous activity of the wild-type B2 receptor was detected in these cells. Mutating a cluster of serines and threonines within the fourth intracellular domain of the receptor, which is critical for agonist-promoted desensitization, significantly increased the spontaneous receptor activity. BK, the natural B2 receptor ligand and, consequently, a full agonist, stimulated PI hydrolysis at high and low levels of spontaneous receptor activity. On the other hand, the partial agonists NPC17731 and HOE140 were stimulatory, or agonists, at the lower level of receptor activity but inhibitory, or inverse agonists, at the higher level of activity. These results show that receptors are desensitized in response to their spontaneous activity. Furthermore, these results, which refute traditional theories, show that the capacity of a drug to modulate a receptor response is not intrinsic to the drug but is also dependent on the cellular environment in which the drug acts.

G protein-coupled receptor bradykinin GPCR kinase intracellular domain phosphoinositide wild-type GPCR1 constitute the largest family of receptors and mediate responses to numerous agonists including hormones, neurotransmitters, and sensory stimuli. Receptor activation by the agonist ligand is considered the first step in receptor signal transduction. However, the recent discovery that GPCR exhibit ligand-independent, spontaneous, and mutation-induced activity has introduced a new function that needs to be considered in cellular signaling and ligand action (1Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) and that can lead to disease (2Coughlin S.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 3Milano C.A. Allen L.F. Rockman H.A. Dolber P.C. McMinn T.R. Chien K.R. Johnson T.D. Bond R.A. Lefkowitz R.J.

Nature. 1997; 385: 347-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). GPCR have evolved as the most common targets for therapeutic drugs (5Stadel J.M. Wilson S. Bergsma D.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 430-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Drug efficacy is defined as the capacity of a drug to activate or inactivate a receptor response and is fundamental to pharmacology and drug development. Classically, this parameter has been considered an intrinsic property of the drug and independent of the cellular environment in which the drug acts (6Ariëns E.J. Arch. Int. Pharmacodyn. Ther. 1954; 99: 32-49PubMed Google Scholar, 7Stephenson R.P. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1956; 11: 379-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (965) Google Scholar, 8Furchgott R.F. Harper N.J. Simmonds A.B. Advances in Drug Research. Academic Press, New York1996: 21-55Google Scholar). Partial agonists, or mixed agonists/antagonists, are prevalent among GPCR drugs and are defined as ligands that elicit a submaximal receptor response and block the response to the natural receptor ligand, a full agonist, or any other ligand of higher efficacy. It has been predicted that in the absence of a more efficacious agonist, the efficacy and behavior of a partial agonist should be directly dependent upon the level of spontaneous receptor activity (9Kenakin T. Pharmacol. Rev. 1996; 48: 413-463PubMed Google Scholar). In other words, if the partial agonist ligand elicits a response that is higher than the spontaneous activity, then the ligand should behave as an agonist, whereas if the ligand elicits a lower response, then the ligand should block the spontaneous activity and, consequently, behave as an inverse agonist. Desensitization is classically defined as the fading of a receptor response to persistent agonist stimuli and manifests itself in numerous biological processes. Agonist-promoted desensitization of GPCR is common (10Hausdorf W.P. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 2881-2889Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar), and the mechanism for this process has been described in considerable detail (11Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, 12Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). Desensitization in response to spontaneous receptor activity, or basal desensitization, should also occur but has not been investigated to any significant extent. However, this process represents one cellular mechanism which may regulate spontaneous receptor activity and, consequently, the action of partial receptor agonists. In this study, we used the human B2 bradykinin (BK) receptor expressed in HEK293 cells to show that receptors are subject to desensitization in response to their spontaneous activity. Furthermore, the level of basal desensitization and, consequently, spontaneous receptor activity determines the efficacy and behavior of two potent and selective BK antagonists and partial B2 receptor agonists as either agonists or inverse agonists at the receptor. [prolyl-3,4-3H]NPC17731 (53.5 Ci/mmol) and myo- [3H]inositol (10–20 Ci/mmol) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. All other chemicals were obtained as previously described (13Fathy D.B. Mathis S.A. Leeb T. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12210-12218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Mutations and transfections of the human B2 receptor were done as described previously (13Fathy D.B. Mathis S.A. Leeb T. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12210-12218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Mutations were made using a polymerase chain reaction-ligation-polymerase chain reaction protocol, and HEK293 and A10 cells were transfected with varying amounts of receptor DNA (0.01–0.2 μg/106 cells) using the calcium phosphate precipitate method and LipofectAMINE, respectively. Expression of receptor constructs was assayed by radioligand binding on intact cells essentially as described previously (14Tropea M.M. Munoz C.M. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1992; 70: 1360-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In short, cells were incubated in Leibovitz'sl-15 medium, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, including the protease inhibitors bacitracin (140 μg/ml) and 1,10-phenanthroline (1 mm) and a saturating concentration of [3H]NPC17731 (3–5 nm) at 4 °C for 60–90 min. The assays were terminated by dilution in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, 0.3% bovine serum albumin and rapid vacuum filtration on Whatman GF/C filters previously soaked in 1% polyethyleneimine. Activities of receptor constructs were assayed by monitoring PI hydrolysis and mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ essentially as described previously (13Fathy D.B. Mathis S.A. Leeb T. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12210-12218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 15Mathis S.A. Criscimagna N.L. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 128-139PubMed Google Scholar). PI hydrolysis was assayed in HEK293 cells prelabeled with 1 μCi/mlmyo-[3H]inositol in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 5% heat-inactivated horse serum. Following washing, the cells were incubated in Leibovitz's l-15 medium containing 50 mm LiCl in the absence and presence of ligands for 30 min at 37 °C. The cytosolic free Ca2+ signal from single fura-2 labeled A10 cells was acquired as the ratio of Ca2+-bound fura-2/Ca2+-free fura-2, denoted as F340/F380, and processed by an integrated digital imaging fluorescence microscopy system. The average of the net peak ratio values for wild-type (WT) and B2ASer/Thr were 2.44 and 2.15, respectively. Aligning the matching frames from individual traces allowed for the averaging of normalized responses from multiple experiments. As small variations occurred from one experiment to the next in the amount of elapsed time between ligand additions, artificial breaks were inserted in the traces so that both marker frames could be matched. To analyze ligand-independent, spontaneous activity of the human WT B2 receptor, basal cellular PI hydrolysis was assayed as a function of the density of the receptor in transiently transfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 1 B). The slope of this function, which may be considered an index of the level of spontaneous receptor activity and which we term index of basal activity, or IB, was very low (0.03), indicating that the WT receptor was virtually inactive in the absence of a ligand in these cells. In the presence of 1 μm BK, the slope, which we term index of maximal agonist-promoted activity, or IA, was 0.86, a 23-fold increase over the ligand-independent B2 receptor activity (Fig.1 C). BK activation of the WT receptor also was observed by monitoring the downstream mobilization of intracellular Ca2+ in transiently transfected A10 cells. As shown in Fig.1 D, 0.1 μm BK elicited a rapid and transient increase in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration in these cells, which returned to nearly base-line levels by 5 min. The absence of any residual receptor-mediated Ca2+ mobilization and the lack of effect of the BK antagonist HOE140 (1 μm) after approximately 5 min of agonist exposure indicated that the WT receptor was desensitized at this time point as described previously (15Mathis S.A. Criscimagna N.L. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 128-139PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether the low level of ligand-independent, spontaneous activity of the WT B2 receptor was due to desensitization in response to spontaneous receptor activity, or basal desensitization, we mutated receptor residues critical for agonist-promoted desensitization. This mechanism involves the GRK-mediated phosphorylation of specific clusters of serines and threonines in intracellular domain three and/or four (IC-IV) of the receptor (11Pitcher J.A. Freedman N.J. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 653-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar, 12Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1998; 38: 289-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1 A, the human B2 receptor IC-IV contains several serines and threonines, including Ser316, Ser339, Thr342, Thr345, Ser346, and Ser348, which are conserved among known B2 receptors and which may serve as GRK substrates. Furthermore, BK stimulates serine and threonine phosphorylation of the human B2 receptor (16Blaukat A. AbdAlla S. Lohse M.J. Muller-Esterl W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32366-32374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To screen for the role of these residues in the regulation of ligand-independent receptor activity, alanine mutants of each individual conserved residue were assayed for basal PI hydrolysis at approximately equal receptor densities (∼100 fmol/106 cells). As shown in Fig.2 (left panel), individual mutation of Ser339, Thr342, Thr345, and Ser348 yielded small but significant increases (1.4–1.5-fold) in basal PI hydrolysis, whereas mutation of Ser316 and Ser346 had essentially no effect. Interestingly, alanine mutation of Thr342, Thr345, Ser346, and Ser348 (Ser/Thr cluster) as a cluster to yield B2ASer/Thr resulted in an increase (5.1-fold) in basal PI hydrolysis, which was much higher than that seen with each individual mutation alone. Furthermore, expression of increasing amounts of B2ASer/Thr yielded an IB of 0.19 which was 6-fold greater than that of the WT B2 receptor which was 0.03 (Fig. 1 B). These results show that the human WT B2 receptor is phosphorylated and desensitized in response the spontaneous receptor activity and that this process regulates the spontaneous activity of the receptor. The phosphorylation apparently involves primarily Ser339, Thr342, Thr345, and Ser348 in IC-IV. Considering the effect of mutating these residues as a cluster, the full manifestation of receptor desensitization may require phosphorylation of more than one of these residues. Our identification of putative residues phosphorylated in spontaneous B2 receptor desensitization is in good agreement with a very recent study of phosphorylated residues in IC-IV of the unstimulated rat B2 receptor using mass spectrometry (17Soskic V. Nyakatura E. Roos M. Muller-Esterl W. Godovac- Zimmermann J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8539-8545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The BK-stimulated B2 receptor activity was sensitive to mutation of the same conserved residues as the ligand-independent, spontaneous receptor activity (Fig. 2, right panel). Small but significant increases (1.4–1.8-fold) in BK-stimulated PI hydrolysis were observed by individually mutating Ser339, Thr342, Thr345, and Ser348, whereas a significantly larger BK stimulation (2.4-fold) was observed by mutating these residues as a cluster. Interestingly, truncation of IC-IV at residue 313 resulted in a construct that bound BK but did not elicit either a spontaneous or BK-stimulated response. In the experiment described in the figure, the alanine mutant of Ser316 exhibited an apparently elevated activity, but this activity was due to a higher level of expression of this mutant in this representative experiment. Addition of 1 μm BK to B2ASer/Thr yielded an IA of 1.5, which was approximately 2-fold greater than that of the WT B2 receptor which was 0.86 (Fig. 1 C). The equilibrium dissociation constants of BK binding to the WT B2 receptor (0.104 ± 0.025 nm; n = 2) and B2ASer/Thr (0.123 ± 0.026 nm;n = 2) were approximately the same, indicating that the elevated stimulation of B2ASer/Thr was not due to an increase in the affinity of BK for the receptor. The importance of the Ser/Thr cluster in receptor desensitization was also observed in BK stimulation of intracellular Ca2+ mobilization. As shown in Fig. 1 D, stimulation of B2ASer/Thr with BK resulted in a response which was biphasic with a second phase characterized by a plateau of elevated free Ca2+, and this response remained elevated for ≫5 min. That the second phase was due to sustained agonist-stimulated receptor activity was evident from the immediate and large decrease in the free Ca2+ level following addition of HOE140 (1 μm) after approximately 5 min of agonist stimulation. Thus, desensitization of ligand-dependent and -independent B2 receptor activity involves the same cluster of serines and threonines in IC-IV. This cluster is located between two acidic residues, Glu337 and Glu350, which are conserved among B2 receptors and which have been shown to be important for GRK recognition (18Onorato J.J. Palczewski K. Regan J.W. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Benovic J.L. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 5118-5125Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Based on the observation of ligand-independent, spontaneous, and mutation-induced GPCR activity, current models state that these receptors spontaneously isomerize between inactive and activated conformational states termed R and R*, respectively, and that R* associates with a G protein to form R*G which triggers the intracellular signal (1Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar, 9Kenakin T. Pharmacol. Rev. 1996; 48: 413-463PubMed Google Scholar). R* is also believed to be a substrate for GRK and, consequently, subject to desensitization (19Pei G. Samama P. Lohse M. Wang M. Codina J. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2699-2702Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In this model, full agonists act by selectively stabilizing, and therefore maximally shifting, the equilibrium toward the activated R* state and, consequently, R*G, whereas inverse agonists act by stabilizing the inactive R state. This model predicts that a full agonist behaves as an agonist independently of the spontaneous receptor activity. The only exception would be if the spontaneous activity is as high as the agonist-stimulated activity in which case the agonist should have no effect. Indeed, BK dose-dependently stimulated the activity of both the WT B2 receptor and B2ASer/Thr (Fig.3A). Thus, BK acts as an agonist independently of the level of spontaneous activity and receptor desensitization. The higher maximal BK response on B2ASer/Thr was expected, since this construct is subject to less desensitization than the WT B2 receptor (Fig. 3 A). NPC17731 and HOE140 are two structurally similar, potent, and selective BK peptide antagonists (20Kyle D.J. Martin J.A. Burch R.M. Carter J.P. Lu S.F. Meeker S. Prosser J.C. Sullivan J.P. Togo J. Noronha-Blob L. Sinsko J.A. Walters R.F. Whaley L.F. Hiner R.N. J. Med. Chem. 1991; 34: 2649-2653Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 21Hock F.J. Wirth K. Albus U. Linz W. Gerhards H.J. Wiemer G. Henke S. Breipohl G. Konig W. Knolle J. Scholkens B.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 102: 769-773Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Apparently conflicting results have been noted regarding the action of these antagonists. Partial agonism by HOE140 was observed on the rat WT B2 receptor transiently expressed in COS-1 cells (22Quitterer U. AbdAlla S. Jarnagin K. Muller-Esterl W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13368-13377Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), whereas inverse agonism by HOE140 and NPC17731 was observed on the native B2 receptor in primary cultures of rat myometrial cells (23Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Mathis S.A. Herzig M.C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25970-25973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inverse agonism by HOE140 was also observed on the human WT B2 receptor transiently expressed in COS-7 cells (24Marie J. Koch C. Pruneau D. Paquet J.L. Groblewski T. Larguier R. Lombard C. Deslauriers B. Maigret B. Bonnafous J.C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The absence and presence of partial agonism by HOE140 was observed in native B2 receptor preparations from various rabbit and sheep tissues (25Feletou M. Germain M. Thurieau C. Fauchere J.L. Canet E. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 112: 683-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, the efficacy and behavior of HOE140 and/or NPC17731 differ depending on the cell system expressing the B2 receptor. Fig.3 B shows that NPC17731 dose-dependently stimulated the activity of the human WT B2 receptor expressed in HEK293 cells. The same effect was observed with HOE140 (Fig. 3 C). Consequently, these ligands act as agonists on this receptor in this cell system. In contrast, NPC17731 and HOE140 dose-dependently inhibited the basal activity of B2ASer/Thr (Fig. 3, B and C). Therefore, these ligands act as inverse agonists on this receptor in this system. These results reconcile the apparently conflicting action of BK antagonists reported in the literature and provide direct evidence that the specific action of NPC17731 and HOE140 is governed by the level of spontaneous activity and basal desensitization of the B2 receptor. This conclusion is further supported by the finding that in rat myometrial cells, in which the B2 receptor is subject to very limited desensitization (14Tropea M.M. Munoz C.M. Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 1992; 70: 1360-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), HOE140 and NPC17731 behave as inverse agonists (23Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Mathis S.A. Herzig M.C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25970-25973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These result also show definitively that inverse agonism is a unique pharmacological parameter rather than the result of antagonism of endogenously released agonist. The action of NPC17731 and HOE140 either as agonists by stimulating B2 receptor activity or as inverse agonists by inhibiting basal receptor activity is in direct conflict with current two receptor state models, as in these models a ligand either favors the active R* state or the inactive R state but not both (1Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. Samama P. Costa T. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1993; 14: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). We previously proposed a three-state model of agonist binding to the B2 receptor, which includes an additional intermediate receptor state (26Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Mathis S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9621-9627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This model was based on the ability of BK to promote the sequential formation of three receptor binding states, R ↔ R* ↔ R**, where the formation of the third, equilibrium state R** was blocked by GTP identifying it as the G protein-coupled state of the receptor. Thus, R** in this model equates to R* in two-state models. In the three-state model, the additional intermediate state R* was suggested to be a partially activated state of the receptor not yet fully functionally coupled to the G protein (26Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Mathis S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 9621-9627Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This model can explain our results by inferring that NPC17731 and HOE140 stabilize R*. Thus, when the activity of the spontaneously formed R** is low, possibly due to a relatively high level of desensitization, these ligands would reveal themselves as weak agonists by their ability to favor the conversion R → R*. On the other hand, when the activity of the spontaneously formed R** is high due to a relatively low level of desensitization, these ligands would reveal themselves as inverse agonists by their ability to favor the conversion R** → R*. Thus, the intrinsic parameter of these drugs may be their ability to stabilize R*, and drug efficacy and behavior depends on the activity of R* relative to that of R**. It may be expected that in the above model, the level of maximal stimulation of the WT B2 receptor by NPC17731 and HOE140 should equal that of their maximal inhibition of B2ASer/Thr. As shown in Fig. 3, B and C, this was not the case. However, this difference may be expected if R* is also a substrate for GRK and, consequently, subject to desensitization. If so, the maximal stimulation of the WT B2 receptor should never reach the maximal inhibition of the less desensitized B2ASer/Thr. In conclusion, our results provide several novel and critical pieces of information regarding regulation of ligand-independent GPCR activity and the action of partial receptor agonist. First, these results describe a unique GPCR epitope, which upon mutation leads to an increase in spontaneous receptor activity. We believe this mutation is different from previously reported constitutively activating mutations (27Scheer A. Cotecchia S. J. Recept. Signal Transduction Res. 1997; 17: 57-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), in that it elevates the activity of a spontaneously formed pool of activated receptors by relieving them of desensitization rather than by disrupting interhelical contacts necessary to constrain the receptor in an inactive state. However, an effect of this mutation on the equilibrium constant for the isomerization between the inactive and activated receptor states cannot be excluded. Considering that desensitization varies depending on the cell state and system by variations in, e.g. the activity ratios of receptors and effectors involved in both desensitization and signaling, this mechanism provides the cell with the means to dynamically control GPCR activity independently of a receptor ligand. Second, this mechanism directly influences the action of receptor ligands and, indeed, reconciles the apparent conflict which has been reported in the literature regarding NPC17731 and HOE140. In fact, our results, which directly refute classical pharmacological theories, show that the capacity of a drug to modulate a receptor response is not intrinsic to the drug but is also dependent on the cellular environment in which the drug acts. Chidiac et al. (28Chidiac P. Nouet S. Bouvier M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 50: 662-669PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the efficacies of several inverse agonists at the β2-adrenergic receptor were perturbed following agonist pretreatment to induce desensitization. However, the spontaneous receptor activity was not monitored in this study and, consequently, could not be related to the inverse agonist efficacy. Third, our results show unequivocally that inverse agonism is a unique pharmacological parameter rather than the result of antagonism of endogenously released agonist. Fourth, our results are compatible with the existence of a partially activated receptor state which is stabilized by NPC17731 and HOE140 and which is higher in activity than the inactive R state and lower in activity than the activated R* state."

The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 signaling cascades leading to the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 play important roles in mediating cellular responses to stressful stimuli (reviewed in Refs. 12Kyriakis J.M.

JNK and p38 are phosphorylated via a group of related kinases (MAPKK), which are in turn activated by another set of kinases, designated MAPKKK. While some of the upstream kinases involved in JNK and p38 activation are selective for one or the other pathway, others function in the activation of both signaling cascades. The human MAPKKK MTK1 (its mouse homologue is referred to as MEKK4) has been implicated in the activation of both JNK and p38 (15Gerwins P. Blak J.L. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8288-8295Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 16Takekawa M. Posas F. Saito H. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4973-4982Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar).

Additional experiments demonstrated that the Gadd45-related proteins were capable of enhancing MTK1 activityin vitro and that their overexpression led to activation of JNK and p38. These findings suggest a pivotal role for the Gadd45-related proteins in regulating JNK and p38 activities and Takekawa and Saito (10Takekawa M. Saito H.

One concern with this hypothesis is the apparent discordance between the kinetics of JNK and p38 activation and gadd45induction (2Fornace Jr., A.J. Nebert D.W. Hollander M.C. Luethy J.D.

The recent generation of gadd45-null mice (19Hollander M.C. Sheikh M.S. Bulavin D. Lundgren K. Augeri- Henmueller L. Shehee R. Molinaro T. Kim K. Tolosa E. Ashwell J.D. Rosenberg M.D. Zhan Q.

Genet. 1999; 23: 176-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar) has provided us the opportunity to directly address its role in activating JNK and p38 during stress. The results of experiments described here, comparing kinase activities of embryo fibroblasts derived fromgadd45 +/+ and gadd45 −/−mice, indicate that Gadd45 is not required for JNK or p38 activation during stress, nor does absence of Gadd45 result in any deficiency in JNK or p38 activity. From additional experiments, in which we have systematically compared the kinetics and magnitude of activation of JNK and p38 with those for expression of mRNAs encodinggadd45, myd118/gadd45β, andcr6/gadd45γ, we conclude that stress-induced increases in the expression of these gadd45-related genes are also not involved in the acute activation of JNK or p38 during stress.

The beads were pelleted by centrifugation and washed three times each in lysis buffer and kinase assay buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 2 mm EGTA, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1% Triton X-100). JNK kinase assays were performed as described previously using GST-c-Jun as a substrate (17Liu Y. Gorospe M. Yang C. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8377-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Samples were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, and after drying, were subjected to autoradiography. Quantitation was performed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). To assess the activation of endogenous p38, total cell lysates were immunoblotted with an anti-phospho-p38 antibody (New England Biolabs, Inc., Beverly, MA). In the transient overexpression studies examining HA-p38 activity, cell lysates were first immunoprecipitated with an anti-HA antibody, and phosphorylated HA-p38 was subsequently examined by Western blot analysis (see below) using the anti-phospho-p38-specific antibody. Total cell proteins were extracted from cell monolayers, and 30 μg of protein was size-separated by SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and incubated with the appropriate antibodies. The anti-Gadd45 and anti-Myc antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Specific proteins were detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA was isolated and Northern blot analysis carried out as described (17Liu Y. Gorospe M. Yang C. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8377-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). For detection of gadd45, andmyd118/gadd45β mRNAs, random primer-labeled probes were prepared from plasmids pCMV3Gadd45 and pCMV3MyD118, both obtained from Dr. Albert J. Fornace, Jr. Expression of cr6/gadd45γmRNA was detected using an end-labeled oligonucleotide (5′-tgaaagcattgcccgggatccgttttttgaaagagcagtg-3′) complementary to a unique region in the 3′-untranslated portion of the mRNA (11Zhang W. Bae I. Krishnaraju K. Azam N. Fan W. Smith K. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 4899-4907Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Normalization of Northern signals was performed using an oligomer recognizing the 18 S rRNA (17Liu Y. Gorospe M. Yang C. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8377-8380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Radioactive signals were visualized and quantitated with a PhosphorImager. To determine whether Gadd45 was necessary for JNK activation during stress, we examined the relative activation of JNK occurring in response to a panel of stresses in primary embryo fibroblasts (MEF) obtained from wild type andgadd45-null mice (Fig.1 A). With the exception of γ irradiation, all of the stresses examined significantly elevated JNK activity. No differences in either basal or stress-induced JNK activity were observed between gadd45 +/+ andgadd45 −/− MEF. These results were further confirmed with spontaneously immortalized cultures ofgadd45 +/+ (109T) andgadd45 −/− (132T) MEF, where kinase activities were monitored over a 5-h time period (Fig. 1 B). Although the kinetics of activation varied for the different stresses, in all cases JNK activation was apparent at the earliest time point examined (30 min) and occurred in the absence of detectable gadd45expression. Similar assessment of p38 activity also revealed no deficiency in its stress-induced activation in gadd45 −/− cells (Fig. 2). In fact, in most cases, p38 activation was actually higher in thegadd45 −/− cells relative togadd45 +/+ MEF. Consistent with our observation in primary MEF, we detected no significant activation of JNK or p38 in response to γ irradiation in immortalized lines of eithergadd45 +/+ or gadd45 −/−MEF (data not shown). Gadd45 protein levels were examined in the same immortal MEF populations analyzed for JNK and p38 activities above (Fig.3). As expected, no Gadd45 expression was evident in gadd45 −/− MEF, but in keeping with previous studies in other cell types, MMS was a potent inducer of Gadd45 expression in gadd45 +/+ cells. Importantly, however, induction of Gadd45 was significantly delayed relative to JNK and p38 activation, as no Gadd45 expression was evident until 2 h after addition of MMS (Fig. 3 A). Kinetics and relative magnitude of Gadd45 expression seen with other stresses revealed similar inconsistencies with the activation of JNK and p38 (Fig. 3, A and B); hydrogen peroxide resulted in significantly lower induction of Gadd45 protein compared with MMS treatment, and no induction of Gadd45 protein was seen following UVC irradiation. However, both treatments strongly induced JNK and p38. Although the experiments above rule out a requirement for Gadd45 in stress-induced activation of JNK and p38, they do not preclude the involvement of other Gadd45-related proteins. To investigate this possibility, we examinedgadd45, myd118/gadd45β, andcr6/gadd45γ mRNA expression in gadd45+/+and gadd45−/− MEF. All three mRNAs showed low expression in wild type cells in the absence of stress, but each showed enhanced expression following MMS treatment (Fig.4 A). Importantly, none of the mRNAs were significantly increased until at least 2 h posttreatment. These findings are consistent with the kinetics for Gadd45 protein expression seen above and indicate that stress-induced expression of these genes cannot account for the early activation of JNK and p38 by MMS. Similar observations were made with several other stresses (Fig. 4 B, upper panel). As reported previously (10Takekawa M. Saito H. Cell. 1998; 95: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), the three transcripts appear to be differentially affected by stresses. cr6/gadd45γ was elevated to a much lesser degree by MMS than either gadd45 ormyd118/gadd45β, but showed greater induction than these with anisomycin treatment. Examination of myd118/gadd45βand gadd45γ/cr6 mRNA expression in gadd45−/− MEF revealed kinetics of induction and relative fold increases similar to those seen in the wild type cells (Fig.4 B, lower panel). However, basal expression ofmyd118/gadd45β was higher in gadd45-null cells than in wild type MEF. Analysis of MyD118/Gadd45β and CR6/Gadd45γ protein expression could not be performed due to the lack of suitable antibodies. Although the studies above rule out a requirement for Gadd45 in the activation of JNK and p38, they do not exclude the possibility that high levels of Gadd45 could result in JNK or p38 activation. To address this possibility, three different Gadd45 expression vectors were utilized in co-transfection studies with HA-tagged JNK (HA-JNK). HA-JNK was immunoprecipitated from cells on the following day and assayed for kinase activity. In none of three cell lines examined, HeLa, NIH3T3, or COS-7, could we see evidence for the ability of Gadd45 to activate JNK (Fig.5 A). In contrast, overexpression of a constitutively active mutant form of MEKK1 (a known activator of JNK) (20Yan M. Dai T. Deak J.C. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Woodgett J.R. Templeton D.J. Nature. 1994; 372: 798-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar) markedly increased JNK activity. As shown for NIH3T3 cells, expression of HA- and Myc-tagged Gadd45 was verified using anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies, respectively. Similar co-transfection studies were performed with the Myc-Gadd45 expression vector and HA-tagged p38, after which, activation of HA-p38 was assessed by Western analysis using a phosphospecific antibody. No increase in phosphorylated p38 was evident with Gadd45 overexpression, but phosphorylation was evident with overexpression of an active mutant form of MKK6, a known p38 activator (21Derijard B. Raingeaud J. Barrett T. Wu I.H. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 267: 682-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (1409) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 B). NIH3T3 cells contained a considerable amount of phosphorylated p38 even in the absence of stress, but this did not increase with Gadd45 overexpression. We have obtained similar results in several experiments using varying amounts of expression vector DNA. These findings contrast with those reported by Takekawa and Saito (10Takekawa M. Saito H. Cell. 1998; 95: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar), in which overexpression of all three Gadd45-related proteins led to increased JNK and p38 activities. However, Gadd45 was the least effective of the Gadd45-related proteins in activating the kinases. The recent finding that Gadd45 and the Gadd45-related proteins, MyD118/Gadd45β and CR6/Gadd45γ, can bind directly to MTK1 and enhance its kinase activity has implicated these proteins in the early signaling events leading to JNK and p38 activation. In particular, it was proposed that DNA damage and other environmental stresses result in the induction of Gadd45-related proteins, which in turn activate MTK1 leading to activation of JNK and p38. Our observation that JNK and p38 activation in response to environmental stresses clearly precedes induction of all threegadd45-related genes argues strongly against the hypothesis that stress-induced levels of the Gadd45-related proteins are involved in the acute activation of JNK and p38. However, it remains possible that stress-elevated levels of the Gadd45-related proteins could contribute to the activation of JNK or p38 in other stress paradigms in which there is a later onset and sustained activation. Such a scenario was suggested in a recent report where BRCA1 overexpression was found to result in both induction of GADD45 and JNK-dependent apoptosis, but these effects have not been functionally linked (22Harkin P.D. Bean J.M. Miklos D. Song Y.H. Truong V.B. Englert C. Christians F.C. Ellisen L.W. Maheswaran S. Oliner J.D. Haber D.H. Cell. 1999; 97: 575-586Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). It is also possible that the Gadd45-related proteins serve a role in regulating MTK1 activity that can be satisfied by basal levels of the proteins, but that MTK1 activation in cells requires some additional factor(s) that is influenced by stress. It is important to emphasize that while MTK1 is localized within the cytoplasm, Gadd45 is present mostly in the nucleus and has been implicated in a variety of nuclear-associated processes (e.g. replication, DNA repair, and cell cycle arrest). Its enhanced expression during stress is likely related to these important functions. Finally, our studies with gadd45-null MEF demonstrate that at least this member of the Gadd45-related gene group is not required for acute activation of JNK or p38. However, our findings do not exclude the possibility that a function for Gadd45 in regulating JNK/p38 signaling could be compensated for by basal expression of Gadd45β and/or Gadd45γ in the gadd45-null MEF. Even in such a case, stress-induced increases in these proteins are clearly not necessary for the acute activation of JNK and p38 following stress. Obviously, further studies, including targeted disruption of the other Gadd45-related genes will be necessary to address whether any of the Gadd45-related proteins serve an obligatory function in regulating the activities of these stress-activated kinases. We thank Dr. Albert J. Fornace, Jr. for his generosity in providing to us the gadd45 +/+ andgadd45 −/− MEF prior to their publication. We also thank Drs. Eitan Shaulian and Michael Karin for helpful discussions and sharing of unpublished data, and Dr. Dan Longo for critical review of this work."
https://openalex.org/W2058052082,"Mutations Arg(117) --> His and Asn(21) --> Ile in human trypsinogen-I have been recently associated with hereditary pancreatitis (HP). The Arg(117) --> His substitution is believed to cause pancreatitis by stabilizing trypsin against autolytic degradation, while the mechanism of action of Asn(21) --> Ile has been unknown. In an effort to understand the effect(s) of this mutation, Thr(21) in the highly homologous rat trypsinogen-II was replaced with Asn or Ile, and the recombinant zymogens and their active trypsin forms were studied. Kinetic parameters of all three trypsins were comparable, and the active enzymes suffered autolysis at similar rates, indicating that neither catalytic properties nor proteolytic stability of trypsin are influenced by mutations at position 21. When incubated at pH 8.0, 37 degrees C, pure zymogens underwent autoactivation with concomitant trypsinolytic degradation in a Ca(2+)-dependent fashion. Thus, in the presence of 5 mM Ca(2+), autoactivation and digestion of the zymogens after Arg(117) and Lys(188) were observed, while in the presence of 1 mM EDTA autoactivation and cleavage at Lys(188) were reduced, and zymogenolysis at the Arg(117) site was enhanced. Overall rates of zymogen degradation in [Asn(21)]- and [Ile(21)]trypsinogens were higher in Ca(2+) than in EDTA, while [Thr(21)]trypsinogen demonstrated inverse characteristics. Remarkably, both in the presence and absence of Ca(2+), [Ile(21)]trypsinogen exhibited significantly higher stability against autoactivation and proteolysis than zymogens with Asn(21) or Thr(21). The observations suggest that autocatalytic trypsinogen degradation may be an important defense mechanism against excessive trypsin generation in the pancreas, and trypsinogen stabilization by the Asn(21) --> Ile mutation plays a role in the pathogenesis of HP."
https://openalex.org/W1983826913,"In previous studies we showed that the plasma protein histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG) binds strongly to pooled human IgG. In the present work myeloma proteins consisting of different human IgG subclasses were examined for their ability to interact with human HRG. Using an IAsys optical biosensor we found initially that IgG subclasses differ substantially in their affinity of interaction with HRG. However, the most striking finding was the observation that the kinetics of the HRG interaction was dramatically affected by whether the IgG subclasses contained the κ or λ light (L)-chains. Thus, the on-rate for the binding of HRG to the κ L-chain containing IgG1 and IgG2 (IgG1κ and IgG2κ) was ∼4- and ∼10-fold faster than that for the binding of HRG to λ L-chain containing IgG1 and IgG2 (IgG1λ and IgG2λ), respectively, with the dissociation constants (K d) in the range 3–5 nm and 112–189 nm for the κ and λ isoforms, respectively. In contrast, the on-rate for the binding of HRG to IgG3κ and IgG4κ was found to be 9- and 20-fold slower than that for the binding of HRG to IgG3λ and IgG4λ, respectively, with the K d in the range 147–268 nm and 96–109 nm for the κ and λ isoforms, respectively. The binding of HRG to immunoglobulins containing the κ L-chain (particularly IgG1κ) was generally potentiated in the presence of a physiological concentration (20 μm) of Zn2+ (K d decreased to 0.60 ± 0.01 for IgG1κ), but Zn2+ had no effect or slightly inhibited the binding of HRG to immobilized IgG subclasses possessing the λ L-chain. Interestingly, HRG also bound differentially to Bence Jones (BJ) proteins containing κ and λ L-chains, with HRG having a 14-fold lower K d for BJκ than for BJλ when 20 μm Zn2+ was present. HRG also bound to IgM (IgMκ), but the affinity of this interaction (K d ∼1.99 ± 0.05 μm) was markedly lower than the interaction with IgG, and the affinity was actually decreased 4-fold in the presence of Zn2+.

Cell Immunol. 1993; 152: 544-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that HRG binds strongly to immunoglobulin (IgG) and inhibits the formation of insoluble immune complexes (IICs) between ovalbumin and polyclonal rabbit anti-ovalbumin IgG in vitro (16Gorgani N.N. Parish C.R. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Altin J.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6653-6662Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). These latter findings have implicated HRG in regulating IIC formationin vivo, particularly in relation to patient suffering from autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus, where there is an excessive production of autoantibodies and the formation of IICs (17Walport M.J. Davies K.A. Res. Immunol. 1996; 147: 103-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 18Heimer R. Wolf L.D. Abruzzo J.L.

Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1997: 291-307Google Scholar). The failure of IICs to be cleared from the blood circulation in these patients may result in the deposition of IICs in specific target tissues, and this may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of these diseases (20Nasu H. Chia D.S. Knutson D.W. Barnett E.V. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1980; 42: 378-386PubMed Google Scholar). The associated pathology may be caused, at least in part, by the ability of the deposited IICs to activate the complement pathway and to induce inflammation in the target tissue and/or by tissue injury resulting from decreased nutrient transport (21Brown B.P. Nardella F.A. Mannik M. Arthritis Rheum. 1982; 25: 1101-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Immunoglobulin molecules consist of two identical heavy (H)- and light (L)-chains, with the variable regions of the H- and L-chains associating to form the antigen binding site of the antibody. There are nine types of H-chains in humans (μ, δ, γ1, γ2, γ3, γ4, α1, α2, and ε) that define a range of classes and subclasses. The functional role of each of the H-chains, with the exception of the δ chain, is well characterized (22Carayannopoulos L. Capra D.J. Paul W.E. Fundamental Immunology. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1993: 283-314Google Scholar). In addition, in many species there are two types of L-chains, termed κ and λ, but unlike the different H-chain types, their function is unknown (22Carayannopoulos L. Capra D.J. Paul W.E. Fundamental Immunology. 3rd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1993: 283-314Google Scholar). Our recent finding that HRG binds to human IgG with high affinity and inhibits the formation of IICs (16Gorgani N.N. Parish C.R. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Altin J.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6653-6662Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) has raised the question of whether HRG binds with the same affinity to the different IgG subclasses (which can possess either κ or λ L-chains). In the present study we use optical biosensor techniques to study the binding of HRG to several different subclasses of IgG and also to IgM. Our results show that HRG has a differing affinity for the various IgG subclasses but that the L-chain type of IgG also has a marked effect on HRG binding. Thus, the affinity of HRG for the κ forms of IgG1 and IgG2 is at least 10-fold greater than for the λ forms of IgG1 and IgG2 (and other IgG subclasses), with these interactions being significantly affected by the presence of Zn2+. The results provide strong evidence that the binding of HRG to IgG molecules is profoundly influenced by both the H- and L-chain isotype of the IgG molecule, an observation that may have relevance to the ability of HRG to inhibit the insolubilization of IgG-containing immune complexes (IC). Human myeloma IgG1κ, IgG1λ, IgG2κ, IgG2λ, IgG3κ, IgG3λ, and IgG4κ, were purchased from Sigma; IgG4λ and IgMκ were from Calbiochem-Novabiochem and Accurate Chemicals, respectively. Bence Jones (BJ) proteins were a generous gift from Dr. Bob Raison, University of Technology, Sydney. Human IgG (isolated from pooled human serum), bovine serum albumin (BSA, fraction V), aprotinin, polyoxyethylenesorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20), phosphate-citrate buffer with sodium perborate capsules and 2,2′-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) diammonium (ABTS) were purchased from Sigma. Carboxymethyl dextran cuvettes for the IAsys biosensor, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl carbodiimide) (EDC),N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS), and ethanolamine were purchased from Fisons Affinity Sensors, Cambridge, UK. Streptavidin (STP) was purchased from Progen Industries, Australia. Sulfosuccinimidyl 6-(biotinamido) hexanoate (NHS-LC-biotin), gentle Ag/Ab elution buffer (a cuvette regeneration buffer gentle to the dextran matrix), and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated STP (HRP-STP), were purchased from Pierce. Native human HRG of 75-kDa molecular mass was purified from fresh human plasma as described previously (23Rylatt D.B. Sia D.Y. Mundy J.P. Parish C.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 119: 641-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) by equilibrating a phosphocellulose column with loading buffer containing 10 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.8) that contained 1 mm EDTA and 0.5 m NaCl. The plasma was mixed with EDTA and NaCl to final concentrations similar to the loading buffer and with 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF) (ICN Pharmaceutical Inc., Costa Mesa, CA) at 100 μg/ml and aprotinin (a trypsin inhibitor) at 2 μg/ml. The plasma was passed through the equilibrated column, and unbound protein was removed by extensive washing of the column with the loading buffer. Bound HRG was then eluted from the column using the same buffer containing 2 m NaCl. The proteins to be biotinylated (e.g. IgG subclasses, HRG, IgM, BSA, BJ proteins) were dissolved in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 150 mm NaCl (PBS) at a concentration of 1 mg/ml and then reacted with 1 mg/ml NHS-LC-biotin for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) to a final concentration of 100 mm. Unreacted biotin was removed by washing the sample extensively (five cycles of concentration and dilution) in a Centricon 10 microconcentrator (Amicon Inc) before storing the biotinylated proteins at −20 °C in small aliquots until use. The lyophilized κ and λ BJ proteins (BJκ and BJλ) were dissolved in PBS. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed that BJκ consisted of two bands of molecular masses ∼ 22 kDa and ∼ 44 kDa, whereas the BJλ consisted of only a single band of molecular mass ∼ 44 kDa. These proteins were subjected to gel filtration using a Superose 12 fast protein liquid chromatography column to separate the monomeric from the dimeric form of each protein, particularly for BJκ; BJλ showed only a single peak, demonstrating that it existed exclusively in a dimer form. The dimeric form of each protein was biotinylated for use in all ELISA and biosensor studies. The binding of biotinylated forms of human IgG subclasses (myeloma-derived), IgM, and BJ proteins to immobilized human HRG was examined by ELISA. HRG (20 μg/ml) was immobilized on Maxi-Sorb ELISA trays by incubating in 0.1 m NaHCO3 buffer (pH 9.6) for 1 h at 37 °C. The trays were blocked with PBS containing 10 mg/ml BSA and 3 mm NaN3(PBS-BSA-Az) for 1 h at 37 °C and then incubated with biotinylated proteins in the concentration range between 1.6 and 100 μg/ml in PBS-BSA-Az for 3 h at 37 °C. Unbound proteins were washed away three times with PBS containing 10 mg/ml BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-BSA-T). Bound biotinylated proteins were detected by incubating the trays with HRP-STP (in 1/500 dilutions) in PBS containing 10 mg/ml BSA (PBS-BSA) for 1 h at 37 °C. This was followed by incubating the trays with the colorimetric HRP substrate ABTS (0.2 mg/ml) for 30 min at 37 °C in a 0.05 m sodium citrate, 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 0.03% (v/v) sodium perborate (a substitute for hydrogen peroxide). The absorbance of the solution of each well was measured at 405 and 490 nm using an ELISA plate reader (dual wavelength measurement). The results showed that the binding of these proteins to immobilized HRG was concentration-dependent. There was no color development in control experiments using trays coated with BSA instead of HRG or when the trays were incubated with biotinylated BSA (b-BSA) instead of the biotinylated proteins. These control experiments, therefore, indicated that the binding of these proteins was specific for HRG. An IAsys resonant mirror biosensor (Affinity Sensors, Cambridge, UK) (24Cush R. Cronin J.M. Stewart W.J. Maule C.H. Molloy J. Goddard N.J. Biosensors Bioelectron. 1993; 8: 347-354Crossref Scopus (386) Google Scholar,25Buckle P.E. Davies R.J. Kinning T. Yeung D. Edwards P.R. Pollard-Knight D. Lowe C.R. Biosens. Bioelectronics. 1993; 8: 355-363Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar) with a carboxymethyl dextran-sensing cuvette was used to determine the kinetic constants and affinities of the binding of HRG to immobilized ligands (e.g. IgG, IgM, and BJ proteins). Except where indicated, all experiments were performed in PBS-BSA-T and at a temperature of 25 °C. The BSA (1%, w/v) was included in the buffer to reduce any nonspecific binding of the proteins and also to buffer the effects of any added Zn2+ (in the experiments where Zn2+ was included), since a large proportion of plasma Zn2+ is bound to albumin (26Aiken S.P. Horn N.M. Saunders N.R. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1992; 445: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The reaction vessel was stirred continuously by the aid of a propeller. Binding was measured at 2-s intervals, and the readout from the biosensor was in units of arc-s. Each binding reaction was routinely followed for 5 min. All binding experiments were performed at least in duplicate. The Fast Fit program supplied by Fisons was used to evaluate the kinetic constants (27George A.J.T. French R.R. Glennie M.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 183: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). STP was coupled via ε-amino groups to the carboxymethyl dextran-sensing surface of the IAsys biosensor cuvette using EDC and NHS (24Cush R. Cronin J.M. Stewart W.J. Maule C.H. Molloy J. Goddard N.J. Biosensors Bioelectron. 1993; 8: 347-354Crossref Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 25Buckle P.E. Davies R.J. Kinning T. Yeung D. Edwards P.R. Pollard-Knight D. Lowe C.R. Biosens. Bioelectronics. 1993; 8: 355-363Crossref Scopus (170) Google Scholar). This was done by equilibrating the cuvette in PBS buffer containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and then reacting the cuvette with a mixture of EDC/NHS for 7 min. Unreacted EDC/NHS was washed away with PBS-T followed by three washes with 0.01 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5). STP (50 μg/ml) in indicated acetate buffer was added to the cuvette and allowed to react with the activated carboxyl groups for 5 min. Uncoupled STP was removed by washing with the acetate buffer, and unreacted succinimidyl groups were blocked by incubating with ethanolamine (1 m, pH 8.5) for 2 min. The cuvette was washed three times with the acetate buffer and then washed with PBS-T followed by a wash with 10 mm HCl to remove any noncovalently bound protein. A biosensor response of ∼500 arc s for the immobilized STP was observed. According to the data provided by the manufacturer this response represents the coupling of 3 ng of STP/mm2 of sensing surface. Biotinylated proteins (e.g. b-IgG subclasses or biotinylated IgM (b-IgM)) were coupled to the immobilized STP as follows. Biotinylated protein (50 μg/ml) in PBS-T (e.g.IgG or HRG) was added to the STP-coupled dextran cuvette equilibrated in PBS-T and allowed to bind to the immobilized STP for 5 min. Nonspecifically bound biotinylated protein was removed by washing three times with PBS-T, followed by three washes with 10 mm HCl for 2 min (for 3 cycles). As noted previously (16Gorgani N.N. Parish C.R. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Altin J.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6653-6662Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), our studies indicate that the ability of HRG to bind to immunoglobulins is lost when the HRG is biotinylated and immobilized by binding to streptavidin that has been covalently attached to the biosensor surface. Similarly, the ability of HRG to bind IgG is lost when the HRG is immobilized directly by the use of the homobifunctional cross-linking reagent bis(sulfosuccinimidyl) suberate (BS3). Interestingly, HRG immobilized by these procedures is still able to bind the complement component C1q (16Gorgani N.N. Parish C.R. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Altin J.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6653-6662Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), suggesting that some functions of HRG are unaffected by the immobilization. The most likely explanation for these observations is that the free ε-amino groups on the HRG involved in biotinylation and cross-linking reactions are located close to the immunoglobulin binding region(s), and that this region(s) is sterically hindered upon immobilization of the HRG. Biosensor studies of the binding of HRG to immunoglobulins, therefore, could only be carried out by examining the binding of soluble HRG to immobilized immunoglobulins. Before immobilization of the biotinylated proteins on the STP-dextran, nonspecific binding between the protein ligands and the STP-dextran was assessed by the addition of different amounts of the nonbiotinylated protein ligands in PBS-BSA-T to the cuvette. Under these conditions no significant level of nonspecific binding of any of the protein ligands used in this study could be detected. Preliminary experiments were performed to establish the concentration range of protein-ligand suitable for kinetic analysis. PBS-T was added to the protein-coupled cuvette to establish a base line (5 min), and protein-ligand was then added in PBS-T at different concentrations. Binding of the protein-ligand was studied by monitoring the association phase for 5 min. Subsequently, the cuvette was washed with PBS-T, and the dissociation phase was monitored for 5 min. Bound protein-ligand was removed (cuvette regeneration) by washing with either 10 mm HCl or the gentle Ag/Ab elution buffer (Pierce). The base line was then re-established after washing the cuvette with PBS-T. As previously (16Gorgani N.N. Parish C.R. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Altin J.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6653-6662Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), we found no evidence that the 10 mm HCl cuvette regeneration wash significantly affected the ability of the proteins to subsequently interact with immobilized proteins on the cuvette surface. The IAsys biosensor was provided with a digital DECpc 450D2LP computer. Data obtained with the biosensor were transferred directly to the Fast Fit program (Fisons Applied Sensor Technology). This program uses an iterative curve-fitting to derive the observed rate constant and the maximum response at equilibrium due to ligand binding at the particular ligand concentration. The association of a soluble ligand with an immobilized macromolecule can be described by the pseudo first order equation R t = R 0 +E(1 − e −k obst), when only one binding site is available for the ligand (24Cush R. Cronin J.M. Stewart W.J. Maule C.H. Molloy J. Goddard N.J. Biosensors Bioelectron. 1993; 8: 347-354Crossref Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In this equation,R t is the IAsys response at time t in units of arc s (this is proportional to the concentration of ligand-protein complex at time t, R t α [ligand-protein]t), R 0 is the IAsys response at time t = 0 in units of arc s induced by the addition of the ligand solution to the buffer in the cuvette (this represents a net displacement of the biosensor signal, and its value is determined by the Fast Fit program for each binding curve analyzed),R 0 α [ligand-protein]0, E is the maximum IAsys response in units of arc s due to bound ligand at equilibrium (E α [ligand-protein]0∞), andK obs is the observed rate constant (termedk on in Fast Fit) given byK obs = k on[ligand] +k off (27George A.J.T. French R.R. Glennie M.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 183: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). For two binding sites the Fast Fit program uses the equation R t = R 0+ E 1(1 −e −kobs1t)+E 2(1 −e −kobs2t) to derive the kinetic constants (24Cush R. Cronin J.M. Stewart W.J. Maule C.H. Molloy J. Goddard N.J. Biosensors Bioelectron. 1993; 8: 347-354Crossref Scopus (386) Google Scholar). In this equation E 1and E 2 are the maximum response at equilibrium due to binding of the ligand to the high and low affinity binding site, respectively; and k obs1 andk obs2 represent the observed rate constants for the high and low affinity binding site, respectively. This equation assumes that, at equilibrium, the ligand-protein complex is stable; thus, the equilibrium line must be parallel to the starting base line ([ligand-protein]∞), and at least 80–90% of the data must be taken into account when fitting data to a curve for either single or double exponential binding. The binding of HRG to λ L-chain containing IgG subclasses (IgGλ) and IgM could only be fitted to a single exponential and not to a double exponential. A linear relationship was obtained by plottingk obs versus ligand concentration for the interaction of HRG with these IgG subclasses (IgGλ) and IgM. In contrast, no linear relationship was obtained by plottingk obs versus ligand concentration for the interaction of HRG with immobilized human IgG subclasses containing κ L-chain (IgGκ), indicating that the data does not fit an exponential curve. Therefore, in these instances, similar to other kinetic analyses (27George A.J.T. French R.R. Glennie M.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1995; 183: 51-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), the first region of the progress curve that best fits the single exponential term (assuming that thermodynamic equilibrium is reached) was used to evaluate the parameters for the highest affinity interaction. This was done by plotting ln((E − (R t −R 0))/E) versus time and selecting the linear region of this plot. In some instances the Fast Fit program was used to extrapolate the dissociation data to the base line for determination of thek off. Values ofK d values obtained by using the relationship K d =k off/k on were in good approximation with those obtained by Scatchard analysis of the extent of association (not shown). We have previously shown that HRG binds to immobilized human IgG (from pooled human serum) with high affinity (K d = 85 ± 15 nm) (16Gorgani N.N. Parish C.R. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Altin J.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6653-6662Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To determine whether HRG binds with a similar affinity to each different IgG subclass, preliminary experiments were carried out to examine the binding of biotinylated IgG1κ, IgG2κ, IgG3κ, and IgG4κ to immobilized HRG in an ELISA assay. In these studies, which involved the incubation of HRP-STP conjugate followed by color development as described previously (16Gorgani N.N. Parish C.R. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Altin J.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6653-6662Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the binding of each IgG subclass to the immobilized HRG could be detected. The experiments indicated that each of the four different subclasses of IgG binds to immobilized HRG in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, the dissociation constants (K d) for the binding of IgG(κ) to immobilized HRG, as determined by Scatchard analysis after plotting (1/maximum bound) versus (1/IgG concentration), was found to follow the relationship IgG2κ > IgG1κ >>> IgG3κ > IgG4κ (data not shown). To further characterize the interaction of HRG with IgG subclasses, the binding of native human HRG to each of the four IgG subclasses possessing the κ L-chain also was examined using the IAsys biosensor. As noted above, these studies required the immobilization of the IgG subclasses rather than the HRG, as the immobilization of the HRG to the biosensor surface resulted in the HRG losing its ability to interact with any of the immunoglobulins, probably due to steric effects. Therefore, for these studies 20–60 ng of biotinylated human IgG (of the indicated subclass possessing κ L-chain) was immobilized via STP coupling onto the surface of a dextran cuvette, and the binding of soluble HRG to the immobilized IgG subclass was carried out following equilibration of the cuvette in PBS-BSA-T. Thus, HRG was added in PBS-BSA-T, and the association phase for the binding of native human HRG to the immobilized IgG1κ was monitored for 5 min. Subsequently, the cuvette was washed three times with PBS-BSA-T buffer (to bring the liquid phase HRG concentration to zero), and the dissociation phase was monitored for 5 min. The biosensor profiles for the binding of different concentrations of HRG to immobilized human IgG1κ are shown in Fig. 1 A. The data show that the binding of HRG to IgG1κ is dependent on the HRG concentration in the range of 10–400 nm and that within this concentration range the binding of HRG is saturable with near-maximal binding (∼500 arc s) occurring at a HRG concentration of 400 nm. The binding of HRG was significantly inhibited (>80%) when the HRG was preincubated before the addition to the cuvette with soluble IgG1κ (IgG1κ/HRG molar ratio > 4, data not shown), suggesting that the HRG interacted specifically with IgG1κ. The observed rate constant for each binding curve, at the indicated concentrations of HRG, was obtained by fitting the curve to the single exponential expression using the Fast Fit program as described previously (16Gorgani N.N. Parish C.R. Easterbrook-Smith S.B. Altin J.G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6653-6662Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). A plot of the observed rate constant (k obs, s−1) against the concentration of HRG (nm) approximated a straight line (see Fig. 1 B), with the line of best fit revealing that HRG binds to immobilized IgG1κ with an on-rate of 1.73 ± 0.04 × 105m−1 s−1 (slope of the plot) and an off-rate of 0.53 ± 0.02 × 10−3s−1 (intercept with the y axis) (see TableI). The dissociation constant for this interaction was determined either using the relationshipK d =k off/k on or by Scatchard analysis of the maximum amount of bound HRG at equilibrium; both methods gave a K d of 3.0 ± 0.1 nm(see Table I).Table IRate and dissociation constants for the interaction of HRG with various κ and λ light chains containing ligands (I"

In human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells stimulation of muscarinic receptors by carbachol activates phosphoinositide signaling and also caused a rapid, large, and long lasting increase in RGS2 mRNA levels. Direct activation of protein kinase C also rapidly increased RGS2 mRNA levels. Inhibition of protein kinase C with Ro31-8220, GF109203x, or Go6976 or down-regulation of protein kinase C inhibited increases in RGS2 mRNA levels induced by carbachol or by the activation of protein kinase C. Blockade of calcium signaling did not alter carbachol-induced increases in RGS2 mRNA levels. Neither activation of epidermal growth factor receptors nor stimulation of cyclic AMP production with forskolin increased RGS2 mRNA levels. Pretreatment with actinomycin D blocked increases in RGS2 mRNA levels but caused a surprisingly small, although statistically significant, partial blockade of protein kinase C-mediated feedback inhibition of carbachol-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Thus, RGS2 mRNA levels are increased by activation of muscarinic receptors coupled to the phosphoinositide signal transduction system through a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism. This action may contribute to negative feedback control of this signaling cascade, but because the small contribution to negative feedback contrasts with the large and prolonged elevations in RGS2 mRNA levels, we speculate that its primary role may be in modulating other signaling components.

RGS proteins contribute to the control and cross-talk of signaling cascades by interacting with activated G-protein α-subunits to facilitate their intrinsic inactivating GTPase reaction. By this, and likely other mechanisms (4Hepler J.R. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Kozasa T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 5Heximer S.P.

How RGS proteins themselves are regulated has begun to be examined in recent investigations, which have generated evidence that one important site of control is at the level of gene expression (2Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). RGS2 is of particular interest to investigators studying the phosphoinositide signal transduction system in the brain (8Pacheco M.A. Jope R.S. Prog. Neurobiol. ( N. Y. ). 1996; 50: 255-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). RGS2 has been linked with regulation of Gq/11, the G-proteins mediating receptor-coupled phosphoinositide hydrolysis, where it functions as a potent inhibitor of Gq/11-mediated activation of phospholipase C (5Heximer S.P.

Furthermore, RGS2 is rapidly regulated by neuronal activity, as the mRNA level for RGS2 but not seven other RGS subtypes was rapidly and transiently increased by treatments that increase neuronal activity, such as electroshock, in a manner reminiscent of immediate early genes, such as c-fos (9Ingi T. Krumins A.M. Chidiac P. Brothers G.M. Chung S. Snow B.E. Barnes C.A. Lanahan A.A. Siderovski D.P. Ross E.M. Gilman A.G. Worley P.F. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7178-7188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

Initial studies of RGS2 mRNA levels in cultured cells have identified several regulatory agents. Concanavalin A stimulated the expression of RGS2 in blood mononuclear cells (12Siderovski D.P. Blum S. Forsdyke R.E. Forsdyke D.R. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 579-587Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 13Heximer S.P. Cristillo A.D. Forsdyke D.R. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), elevation of cyclic AMP increased RGS2 mRNA levels in PC12 cells and T cells (14Pepperl D.J. Shah-Basu S. VanLeeuwen D.

Commun. 1998; 243: 52-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Overall, these studies indicate that RGS2 modulates the activity of the phosphoinositide signal transduction system and is itself subject to rapid regulation through modulation of its expression. Muscarinic receptor-coupled activation of the phosphoinositide signal transduction system has been studied extensively in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y, which endogenously express muscarinic M3 receptors linked to phosphoinositide signaling (16Li X. Song L. Jope R.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5914-5922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Li X. De Sarno P. Song L. Beckman J.S. Jope R.S. Biochem.

Therefore, these cells were used in the present study to determine if RGS2 mRNA levels are subject to modulation by activation of the phosphoinositide signaling system. The results show that in SH-SY5Y cells muscarinic receptor activation leads to rapid, large, and long lasting increases in RGS2 mRNA levels through a protein kinase C-dependent mechanism, and inhibition of transcription when protein kinase C is stimulated reduces feedback inhibition of phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were grown in RPMI medium (Cellgro, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), 5% fetal clone II (Hyclone, Logan, UT), 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were maintained in humidified 37 °C chambers with 5% CO2. Cells were plated at a density of approximately 105 cells/100-mm dish and were treated with experimental agents approximately 48 h later. Agents used include carbachol, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), nickel chloride, epidermal growth factor, and actinomycin D from Sigma; Ro31-8220, GF109203x, Go6976, and forskolin from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA); KN62 from Seikagaku America (Rockville, MD); and 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester) from Calbiochem. RGS2 cDNA was generously provided by Dr. D. R. Forsdyke (Queen's University, Kingston, Ontario, Canada). Total mRNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA (10 μg) was separated by electrophoresis in 1.2% agarose gels containing formaldehyde and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. cDNA was random prime-labeled with [32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were hybridized with labeled probes at 42 °C for 18 h and then washed in two changes of 2× saline-sodium citrate and 0.1% SDS at 20 °C for 20 min and once in 1× saline-sodium citrate and 0.1% SDS at 55 °C for 10 min. Results were obtained using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA), and all experiments were repeated 2–4 times. Cells were prelabeled with 7.5 μCi/ml myo[2-3H]inositol (American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) for 48 h. Where indicated, cells were treated with 1 μm actinomycin D to inhibit transcription or an equivalent amount of dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) for 15 min and 0.2 μm PMA for a subsequent 2 h to induce feedback inhibition of phosphoinositide hydrolysis. Cells were harvested, resuspended in buffer (30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 122 mm NaCl, 3.6 mm NaHCO3, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 1.2 mmMgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 1.3 mmCaCl2, 10 mm LiCl, 11 mm glucose), and washed two times, as described previously (16Li X.

Suspended cells were incubated for 15 or 30 min with or without 1 mmcarbachol at 37 °C, and radioactivity was measured in samples after fractionation of lipids, inositol monophosphate, and inositol as described previously (16Li X. Song L. Jope R.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5914-5922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Measurements were made in triplicate for each treatment in at least three separate experiments. Statistical significance was determined using a paired Student's ttest. RGS2 mRNA levels were measured in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells treated with 1 mm carbachol for 15 min to 24 h. Fig. 1 A shows results from a representative time-course experiment demonstrating that RGS2 mRNA levels rapidly increased upon stimulation of muscarinic receptors with carbachol, whereas actin mRNA levels remained unchanged. Maximal levels of RGS2 mRNA were attained between 90 and 120 min of exposure to carbachol, and pretreatment with the muscarinic receptor antagonist atropine (1 μm) completely blocked carbachol-induced increases in RGS2 mRNA. Thus, stimulation of endogenous muscarinic receptors that are coupled to the phosphoinositide signal transduction system causes a rapid, large, and prolonged increase in RGS2 mRNA levels. Phosphoinositide signaling activates protein kinase C, which is known to cause feedback inhibition of phosphoinositide signaling activity. Therefore protein kinase C was examined as a potential regulator of RGS2 expression. Activation of protein kinase C with 0.2 μm PMA caused a time-dependent increase in RGS2, but not actin, mRNA levels (Fig. 1 B). If protein kinase C participates in muscarinic receptor-induced increases in RGS2 mRNA levels, then inhibitors of protein kinase C should cause similar reductions in the increases in RGS2 mRNA levels induced by the activation of protein kinase C and stimulation of muscarinic receptors. To test this, several protein kinase C inhibitors were used. Two bisindolylmaleimide derivatives, GF109203x and Ro31-8220, inhibited increases in RGS2 mRNA levels induced by treatment with carbachol or PMA with 10 μm GF109203x causing inhibitions of 50–60% and 10 μm Ro31-8220 causing almost 90% inhibition with each stimulant (Fig. 2). Increases induced by PMA and carbachol also were inhibited similarly by an inhibitor of classical protein kinase C subtypes, 10 μm Go6976 (68 ± 2 and 58 ± 11% inhibition, respectively), and by down-regulation of protein kinase C attained by a 24-h pretreatment with 1 μm PMA (48 ± 6 and 47 ± 7% inhibition, respectively). In contrast, carbachol-stimulated RGS2 mRNA levels were unaffected by several agents affecting calcium signaling (Fig. 3 A) including 20 μm1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester) (an intracellular calcium chelator), 2 mm nickel chloride (an inhibitor of the plateau phase of carbachol-stimulated increases in intracellular calcium), and 30 μm KN62 (an inhibitor of calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II). This lack of effects contrasts with previous studies using each of these agents affecting calcium signaling that demonstrated effects on other signaling systems activated by carbachol in SH-SY5Y cells (19Jope R.S. Song L. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 50: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar).Figure 3Modulation of RGS2 mRNA levels by calcium, epidermal growth factor, and forskolin. A,SH-SY5Y cells were preincubated with 2 mm NiCl2(Ni) for 10 min to block the plateau phase of the carbachol-stimulated rise in intracellular calcium, 30 μmKN62 (KN) for 10 min to inhibit calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II, or 20 μm 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)-ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester) (BAPTA) for 30 min to chelate intracellular calcium. RGS2 mRNA levels were measured after a 60-min incubation with 1 mm carbachol. Ctl, control. B, SH-SY5Y cells were incubated with 50 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF) for 0, 30, 60, or 90 min, followed by measurements of RGS2 mRNA levels.

Treatment with epidermal growth factor, which activates signaling through increased protein tyrosine phosphorylation in SH-SY5Y cells (20Jope R.S. Song L. Grimes C.A. Zhang L. J. Neurosci. Res. 1999; 55: 329-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), caused little change in RGS2 mRNA levels (Fig. 3 B). Forskolin, which causes increases in cyclic AMP and has been reported to increase RGS2 mRNA levels in PC12 cells (14Pepperl D.J. Shah-Basu S. VanLeeuwen D. Granneman J.G. MacKenzie R.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 243: 52-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), did not increase but actually decreased RGS2 mRNA levels (Fig. 3 C). To test if RGS2 might contribute to the well known feedback inhibition of phosphoinositide signaling induced by activation of protein kinase C, actinomycin D was used to inhibit transcription. Pretreatment with 1 μm actinomycin D completely blocked increases in RGS2 mRNA (Fig. 4 A). In nonpretreated SH-SY5Y cells, carbachol induced a rapid and robust activation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis, attaining at 15 min of incubation an 8-fold stimulation over the basal rate of phosphoinositide hydrolysis (Fig. 4 B). Activation of protein kinase C using a 2-h pretreatment with 0.2 μm PMA caused an approximately 70% inhibition of the subsequent carbachol-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis (Fig. 4 C). Inhibition of transcription with actinomycin D during the pretreatment with PMA significantly reduced the inhibitory effect on carbachol-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis, with responses attained that were 139 and 124% of those obtained in PMA-treated cells without transcription blockade. Treatment with actinomycin D without PMA treatment did not alter carbachol-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis (data not shown). These results indicate that a portion of the PMA-induced inhibition of phosphoinositide signaling requires activation of gene expression, a finding consistent with the hypothesis that the expression of RGS2 following stimulation of protein kinase C makes a significant contribution to this feedback inhibitory action. This study adds to a small but growing body of research revealing the exquisite responsiveness of RGS2 mRNA levels to extracellular stimuli, as reviewed in the Introduction. The rate at which RGS2 mRNA levels increased after stimulation of muscarinic receptors is comparable to that of the classical c-fos and c-jun immediate early genes (21Trejo J. Brown J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7876-7882Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Larsson C. Gustavsson L. Simonsson P. Bergman O. Alling C. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 268: 19-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), a similarity noted previously in a study of increases in RGS2 mRNA levels in rat brain in response to electroshock (9Ingi T. Krumins A.M. Chidiac P. Brothers G.M. Chung S. Snow B.E. Barnes C.A. Lanahan A.A. Siderovski D.P. Ross E.M. Gilman A.G. Worley P.F. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7178-7188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, increases in RGS2 mRNA levels in SH-SY5Y cells after muscarinic receptor stimulation were relatively long lasting, as the elevation was still evident after 24 h of stimulation with carbachol. Thus, muscarinic receptor activation results in rapid and large, but also prolonged, elevations in RGS2 mRNA levels. Protein kinase C appears to mediate a significant portion of the muscarinic receptor-induced increase in RGS2 mRNA levels. Both stimulation of muscarinic receptors coupled to phosphoinositide signaling and activation of protein kinase C, a second messenger-linked outcome of phosphoinositide signaling, increased RGS2 mRNA levels, and these responses were inhibited equivalently by four treatments that inhibit the activity of protein kinase C. Ro31-8220 was the most effective inhibitor of the induction of RGS2 mRNA, but recent studies have discovered several actions of this agent independent of its inhibition of protein kinase C, some of which may contribute to the practically complete inhibition caused by Ro31-8220 (23Alessi D.R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 402: 121-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 24Yeo E.J. Provost J.J. Exton J.H. Biochim. Biophys.

Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 2145-2151Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The other three treatments, GF109203x, Go6976, and protein kinase C down-regulation, caused 50–60% inhibitions of carbachol- or PMA-induced increases in RGS2 mRNA levels, suggesting that protein kinase C subtypes in the classical family may mediate this portion of the response. Phorbol ester-induced activation of protein kinase C previously was reported to increase the mRNA level of RGS7, but not RGS4, in primary cortical neurons after 12 h of treatment (26Khawaja X.Z. Liang J.J. Saugstad J.A. Jones P.G. Harnish S. Conn P.J. Cockett M.I. J. Neurochem. 1999; 72: 174-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) but did not increase RGS2 mRNA levels in blood mononuclear cells (13Heximer S.P. Cristillo A.D. Forsdyke D.R. DNA Cell Biol. 1997; 16: 589-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Although this is still a limited amount of information, it indicates that, not unexpectedly, there are differences in the mechanisms that regulate mRNA levels for different members of the RGS family of proteins and there are cell-specific differences in the regulation of RGS2 mRNA levels. RGS2 regulates the activity of Gq/11, and for this effect RGS2 is 10-fold more potent than RGS4 (5Heximer S.P. Watson N. Linder M.E. Blumer K.J. Hepler J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14389-14393Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar); in the current study activation of phosphoinositide signaling and of protein kinase C increased RGS2 mRNA levels. These properties suggest that RGS2 may be a regulator of the activity of the phosphoinositide signal transduction system. Our findings on the PMA-induced feedback inhibitory regulation of phosphoinositide signaling are consistent with this proposal but only to a limited extent. Stimulation of protein kinase C using a 2-h pretreatment with PMA inhibited carbachol-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis by 70%, a regulatory influence that has been known for many years but for which a mechanistic basis has not been delineated. Inhibition of transcription by actinomycin D both blocked increases in RGS2 mRNA levels and attenuated the inhibition of phosphoinositide hydrolysis caused by activation of protein kinase C. Taken together, all of these results are consistent with the hypothesis that activation of protein kinase C increases RGS2 expression, which attenuates the activity of the G-proteins mediating phosphoinositide signaling, although selective knockouts of RGS2 will be necessary to fully test this scheme. However, the minor portion of the protein kinase C-induced inhibition of phosphoinositide signaling that was blocked by actinomycin D treatment indicates that other mechanisms contribute the major share to this feedback inhibition. This raises the intriguing possibility that physiological increases in RGS2 may primarily serve other functions. This speculation will be better tested once antibodies are available to measure RGS2 protein levels and after the diverse actions of RGS2 are more completely identified. In summary, stimulation of muscarinic receptors increased RGS2 mRNA levels through a mechanism partially dependent on protein kinase C activation, and transcription was necessary for maximal feedback inhibition by protein kinase C of phosphoinositide signaling. It is likely that other receptors coupled to the phosphoinositide signal transduction system also will modulate RGS2 mRNA levels because protein kinase C mediated a portion of this regulatory response. Thus, stimulation of RGS2 expression may contribute to the control of phosphoinositide signaling activity, and considering the multiple functions of RGS proteins that are being identified, RGS2 may constitute a rapid intracellular mediator of cross-talk among signaling systems.

FWD1 associates with Skp1 through the F-box domain and also recognizes the conserved DSGXXS motif of IκBα. The structural requirements for the interactions of FWD1 with IκBα and with Skp1 have now been investigated further. The D31A mutation (but not the G33A mutation) in the DSGXXS motif of IκBα abolished the binding of IκBα to FWD1 and its subsequent ubiquitination without affecting the phosphorylation of IκBα. The IκBα mutant D31E still exhibited binding to FWD1 and underwent ubiquitination. These results suggest that, in addition to site-specific phosphorylation at Ser32 and Ser36, an acidic amino acid at position 31 is required for FWD1-mediated ubiquitination of IκBα. Deletion analysis of Skp1 revealed that residues 61–143 of this protein are required for binding to FWD1. On the other hand, the highly conserved residues Pro149, Ile160, and Leu164 in the F-box domain of FWD1 were dispensable for binding to Skp1.

The formation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates requires three components that participate in a cascade of ubiquitin transfer reactions as follows: a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and a ubiquitin ligase (E3).1The specificity of protein ubiquitination is often determined by E3 enzymes, and proteins polyubiquitinated by these enzymes are subjected to degradation by the 26 S proteasome. Recent genetic and biochemical studies of yeast have led to the identification of a new class of E3 ligases, termed SCF complexes, that are required for degradation of cyclins and their inhibitors (4Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1377: 61-70PubMed Google Scholar, 5Krek W. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1998; 8: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, in addition to cell cycle-related proteins, an increasing number of molecules important in other biological processes in yeast have been identified as substrates for the SCF complexes (6Patton E.E. Willems A.R. Tyers M. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 236-243Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). These complexes consist of invariable components such as Skp1 and Cdc53 as well as variable components known as F-box proteins, which bind to Skp1 through the F-box domain (7Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K.

The physiological roles of the SCF complex in multicellular organisms remain to be elucidated. Various short-lived regulatory proteins undergo ubiquitination in mammalian cells. One of the most extensively studied of these molecules is IκBα, an inhibitory protein that associates with the dimeric nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and thereby prevents it from entering the nucleus. NF-κB plays a central role in the regulation of genes that function in inflammation, cell proliferation, and apoptosis (10Baldwin Jr., A.S. Annu. Rev.

It is therefore likely that phosphorylation of the DSGXXS motif serves to recruit FWD1 and thereby to link IκBα to the ubiquitination machinery. However, it has remained unknown whether other conserved residues, including Asp31 and Gly33 of the DSGXXS motif, are also essential for ubiquitin-dependent degradation of IκBα. We have now investigated the binding motifs that mediate the interactions of FWD1 with IκBα and Skp1. We molecularly dissected the pathway of IκBα ubiquitination into two steps as follows: phosphorylation of IκBα and subsequent binding of FWD1 to the phosphorylated DSGXXS motif. We identified the region of Skp1 required for binding to FWD1 and performed a mutation analysis of the F-box domain. Our results reveal the structural requirements for complex formation among IκBα, FWD1, and Skp1 during the ubiquitination of IκBα. Furthermore, they may facilitate the identification of new substrates for SCFFWD1 by screening of sequence data bases. 293T cells were grown at 37 °C under an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Life Technologies, Inc.).

Complementary DNAs encoding Skp1 and its deletion mutants, FWD1, and the mutant FWD1(ΔF), each protein-tagged at its NH2 terminus with the Myc or FLAG epitope, were generated by the polymerase chain reaction with the high fidelity thermostable DNA polymerase KOD (Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan). Complementary DNAs encoding one- or two-site FWD1 mutants, each tagged at its NH2 terminus with the FLAG epitope, were generated with the use of a Chameleon site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). IκBα and IKKβ cDNAs were kindly provided by H. Nakano. Complementary DNAs encoding IκBα mutants, each tagged at its NH2terminus with the Myc epitope, were generated with the use of a QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Complementary DNAs encoding all mutant proteins were sequenced and subcloned into pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). 293T cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate method (43Wigler M. Silverstein S. Lee L.S.

After 48 h, the cells were lysed with a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 300 mmNaCl, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, aprotinin (10 μg/ml), leupeptin (10 μg/ml), 10 mm iodoacetamide, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.4 mmNa3VO4, 0.4 mm EDTA, 10 mm NaF, and 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate. The cell lysates were treated with 50 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 1 h at 4 °C and then incubated with 5 μg of appropriate antibodies and protein G-Sepharose beads for 4 h at 4 °C. The resulting immunoprecipitates were then washed thoroughly four times with ice-cold lysis buffer, fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE), and subjected to immunoblot analysis with antibodies (1 μg/ml) to Myc (9E10, Roche Molecular Biochemicals), to the FLAG epitope (M5, Sigma), or to ubiquitin (1B3, MBL, Nagoya, Japan). Complementary DNAs encoding Myc-tagged IκBα and its mutants were subcloned into pGEX-6P1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The recombinant glutathioneS-transferase fusion proteins containing the Myc-IκBα sequences were purified from bacteria with the use of glutathione beads and then treated with PreScission protease (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to remove the glutathione S-transferase sequence. Recombinant AU1-tagged IKKβ was generated as described previously (30Hatakeyama S. Kitagawa M. Nakayama K. Shirane M. Matsumoto M. Hattori K. Higashi H. Nakano H. Okumura K. Onoe K. Good R.A.

In vitro kinase reactions were performed for 30 min at 30 °C with purified AU1-tagged IKKβ and bacterially expressed Myc-tagged IκBα proteins in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm MgCl2, 4.5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EGTA, 100 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction was terminated by adding SDS sample buffer and boiling. The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE on a 9% gel, which was then dried and exposed to x-ray film. Transfected 293T cells were metabolically labeled with Trans-35S (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) at a concentration of 100 μCi/ml for 1 h. After incubation for various times in the absence of isotope, the cells were lysed and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to Myc (9E10) and protein G-Sepharose. The immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE on a 9% gel, and 35S-labeled protein bands were detected by autoradiography. Complementary DNAs encoding Skp1 or FWD1 derivatives were subcloned into pGBT9 or pACTII (CLONTECH), respectively, and used to transform yeast strain SFY526.

All five of these substrates share the DSGXXS motif (Fig. 1 A), the two serine residues of which undergo signal-induced phosphorylation that is a prerequisite for protein ubiquitination and degradation. This shared property suggests that FWD1 may recognize the phosphorylated DSGXXS motif in each of these proteins. To investigate further the role of this motif in IκBα ubiquitination, we mutated conserved residues and thereby created the mutants D31A, D31E, G33A, S32A/S36A, D31A/S32A, and D31A/S36A (Fig. 1 B). IKKβ specifically and equally phosphorylates the two serine residues (Ser32 and Ser36) of the DSGXXS motif in the NH2-terminal region of IκBα (18Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar, 19Zandi E. Chen Y. Karin M. Science. 1998; 281: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 21Woronicz J.D. Gao X. Cao Z. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Science. 1997; 278: 866-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (1068) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of the DSGXXS motif mutations on IκBα phosphorylation, we performed in vitro kinase assays (Fig. 2). Myc-tagged wild-type and mutant IκBα proteins were incubated with or without purified AU1-tagged IKKβ in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP. The extent of phosphorylation of D31A, D31E, and G33A in the presence of AU1-tagged IKKβ was virtually identical to that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 2 A). Although IKKβ has also been shown to phosphorylate the COOH-terminal region of IκBα (16DiDonato J.A. Hayakawa M. Rothwarf D.M. Zandi E. Karin M. Nature. 1997; 388: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (1917) Google Scholar, 18Zandi E. Rothwarf D.M. Delhase M. Hayakawa M. Karin M. Cell. 1997; 91: 243-252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1595) Google Scholar), such activity was not apparent under our experimental conditions, as indicated by the fact that phosphorylation of S32A/S36A by IKKβ was not detected. Taken together, these results suggest that the amino acid substitutions at Asp31 or Gly33 did not affect IκBα phosphorylation at Ser32 and Ser36 by IKKβ. We next examined whether FWD1 binds to the IκBα mutants in vivo. Expression vectors encoding Myc-tagged IκBα or its mutants and FLAG-tagged FWD1 were introduced into 293T cells, with or without a vector encoding FLAG-tagged IKKβ, and immunoprecipitation assays were performed (Fig.3). As shown previously, the interaction of wild-type IκBα with FWD1 required coexpression of IKKβ (30Hatakeyama S. Kitagawa M. Nakayama K. Shirane M. Matsumoto M. Hattori K. Higashi H. Nakano H. Okumura K. Onoe K. Good R.A. Nakayama K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3859-3863Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The D31A mutant did not associate with FWD1 even in the presence of recombinant IKKβ. In contrast, the D31E mutant, in which Asp31 was replaced by another acidic amino acid (Glu), interacted with FWD1 in the presence of IKKβ, although the extent of the interaction was slightly reduced compared with that observed with the wild-type protein. The G33A mutant also interacted with FWD1. Given that mutations at positions 31 or 33 did not affect the phosphorylation of IκBα by IKKβ (Fig. 2 A), these results suggest that the phosphorylation of IκBα at Ser32 and Ser36 is not sufficient and that an acidic residue at position 31 is also required, for binding to FWD1. The possibility remained, however, that only a single serine residue, either Ser32 or Ser36, was phosphorylated in D31A. To exclude this possibility, we generated the double mutants D31A/S32A and D31A/S36A (Fig. 1 B). The in vitro kinase assay revealed that the extent of phosphorylation of D31A/S32A and D31A/S36A was similar and approximately half that of D31A (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that the replacement of Asp31 with Ala did not affect the phosphorylation of either Ser32 or Ser36. We next examined whether the various IκBα mutants are susceptible to ubiquitination. Immunoblot analysis with antibodies to ubiquitin of immunoprecipitates prepared from transfected cells with antibodies to Myc revealed a correlation between the pattern of ubiquitination of IκBα proteins and the pattern of FWD1 binding (Fig. 3). Thus, interaction with FWD1 was associated with a marked increase in the extent of ubiquitination of wild-type IκBα, D31E, and G33A in the presence of IKKβ, with the extent of ubiquitination of D31E and G33A being slightly less than that of the wild-type protein. The D31A mutant neither associated with FWD1 nor underwent ubiquitination. These results indicate that FWD1-induced ubiquitination of IκBα requires not only site-specific phosphorylation but also an acidic residue at position 31. Substitution of Gly33 of IκBα prevented neither its binding to FWD1 nor its ubiquitination mediated by FWD1, although the extent of both reactions was slightly reduced, suggesting that Gly33 might be necessary for maximal ubiquitination. The intracellular abundance of wild-type, D31E, and G33A IκBα proteins was markedly reduced, compared with that of D31A and S32A/S36A, in the presence of FWD1 and IKKβ, likely reflecting an increased rate of turnover of these proteins in the transfected cells (see Fig. 4). To examine whether mutations in the DSGXXS motif of IκBα affect the turnover rate of the protein, we performed pulse-chase experiments (Fig. 4). When expressed in the presence of FWD1 alone, the wild-type and mutant IκBα proteins showed similar turnover rates. However, when coexpressed with both FWD1 and IKKβ, the rates of degradation of the wild-type protein and the D31E and G33A mutants were markedly increased, although the kinetics of degradation of D31E and G33A were slightly slower than those of wild-type IκBα. In contrast, the D31A mutant was relatively stable and, with the exception of the accumulation of a phosphorylated form, showed a pattern of degradation similar to that of the S32A/S36A mutant. This latter result is consistent with our observation that the D31A mutant has lost the ability to bind FWD1 and to undergo ubiquitination but is still phosphorylated on Ser32 and Ser36. Together, these data demonstrate that an acidic residue at position 31 in the DSGXXS motif of IκBα is important for binding to FWD1, for ubiquitination, and for protein degradation but not for phosphorylation. Although it has been established that F-box proteins bind to Skp1 through the F-box domain (7Bai C. Sen P. Hofmann K. Ma L. Goebl M. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 263-274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar), it remains unclear which region of Skp1 interacts with the F-box domain in vivo. To identify the region of Skp1 required for binding to FWD1 in vivo, we generated a series of Myc-tagged NH2- and COOH-terminal deletion mutants of Skp1 (Fig.5 A). Myc-tagged wild-type Skp1, its deletion mutants, or p21Cip1/Waf1 (negative control) was expressed in 293T cells together with FLAG-tagged FWD1, FWD1(ΔF), or p27Kip1 (negative control). Immunoprecipitation assays revealed that wild-type Skp1 as well as the ΔN40 and ΔC20 mutants were detected in FWD1 immunoprecipitates, whereas the ΔN80 and ΔC30 mutants were not (Fig. 5 B). The ΔN60 mutant was also coprecipitated with FWD1, although to a slightly reduced extent compared with that of wild-type Skp1. These results were confirmed by a reciprocal immunoprecipitation analysis (Fig. 5 B). Thus, FLAG-tagged FWD1 was present in the wild-type Skp1, ΔN40, and ΔC20 immunoprecipitates but not in those containing ΔN80 or ΔC30 Skp1 mutants. Again, the amount of FWD1 in the ΔN60 immunoprecipitate was slightly less than that in the wild-type Skp1 precipitate. None of the Skp1 proteins interacted with the FWD1(ΔF) mutant, which comprises residues 1–140 fused to residues 194–569 of FWD1 and therefore lacks the F-box domain. These observations suggest that residues 61–143 of Skp1 are required for binding to FWD1 in vivo. Several amino acid residues are highly conserved among the F-box domains of many F-box proteins (Fig. 6 A). To determine which residues in the F-box domain are necessary for binding to Skp1 in vivo, we replaced the highly conserved amino acids Pro149, Ile160, and Leu164 in the F-box domain of FWD1 with Ala (Fig. 6 B). FLAG-tagged FWD1 derivatives or p27Kip1 (negative control) were expressed in 293T cells together with"

For assessment of the physiological role of ADHs, knowledge of the whole ADH system is important since the different classes and isozymes display considerable overlap in metabolic activities and inhibitor repertoires.

This paper reports on the existence of an ADH of class II type in mouse which together with the rat counterpart form a conserved subgroup of class II ADHs that exhibits low catalytic efficiency as a consequence of slow hydride transfer. The enzymatic characteristics and the consequences of the unique coenzyme binding residues Pro47and Ser182 are investigated. A cDNA coding for an ADH of class II type was isolated from an adaptor-ligated mouse cDNA library (Marathon-ReadyTMcDNA, CLONTECH), by PCR amplification utilizingPfu polymerase (Stratagene). Multiple sequence alignments of characterized class II ADH sequences were used to localize regions with a high degree of positional identity and two primers were designed: 5′-TTGGGCCAGGAGTGA(A/C)CAA-3′ and 5′-AGTCAGTGGCTCCCAGGGC-3′ (Fig. 1). Cycling conditions were: 30 cycles of 95 °C, 45 s; 68 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 1.5 min. PCR amplification yielded a 500-bp fragment which was subsequently ligated into the vector pCRII (Invitrogen) according to the TA-cloning protocol (19Mead D.A. Pey N.K. Herrnstadt C. Marcil R.A. Smith L.M. Bio/Technology. 1991; 9: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) for sequence analysis. The full-length cDNA was obtained by using a rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique. An adaptor-specific primer, AP2 (CLONTECH), together with class II cDNA-specific primers: 5′-GAGCCCTCTCACAAACCTCTGTGG-3′ and 5′-CTACACACCCCAGGCCAAAGACAG-3′, were used for the 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends reactions, respectively. The PCR protocol was as follows: 33 cycles of 95 °C, 45 s; 66 °C, 1 min; 72 °C, 5 min. DNA sequence analysis was performed with the dideoxy method (20Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52756) Google Scholar) on both strands with sequence-specific primers using T7 DNA polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), [α-35S]dATP[S] (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and alkali-denatured plasmids. Deduced sequences were analyzed with the computer program GCG (21Devereux J. Haeberli P. Smithies O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (11531) Google Scholar) and compared with EMBL data banks. The program ClustalW 1.7 (22Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (55974) Google Scholar) was used to create the sequence alignments and in combination with TreeView (Win16) (23Page R.D. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1996; 12: 357-358PubMed Google Scholar) to investigate phylogenies. The entire coding region of mouse class II ADH cDNA was PCR amplified with primers introducing restriction sites NdeI andBamHI, respectively, which facilitated subcloning into the unique restriction sites NdeI/BamHI of the pET29 expression vector (Novagen). In the same manner, the coding region of rat class II cDNA (17Höög J.O. FEBS Lett. 1995; 368: 445-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) was subcloned into the NcoI andBamHI restriction sites of pET3d (Novagen). Both plasmid constructs were verified by sequence analysis throughout the entire coding region. Double-stranded plasmid was prepared with the flexiprep kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for mutagenesis of mouse class II cDNA. Reagents in the U.S.E. mutagenesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and mutagenesis primers: ACGTGTGTGTGCC(A/C/G)TACTGACATC(A/C)ATGCCACCGATCC and 5′-GATGTGGGTTCTCAACCGGCTACGGGGCTG-3′ were used to alter the codons and subsequently replacing Pro47 for His, Asn51 for His, and Ser182 for Thr (nucleotides corresponding to the changed codons are underlined). Selection was based on the elimination of the unique XbaI site of the pET29 vector according to the method described by Deng and Nickoloff (24Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar). Sequence analysis was performed to confirm the presence of the correct mutations and the absence of any unexpected mutations in the cDNA. Recombinant protein was expressed in 1-liter LB cultures of Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) at 29 °C and induced with a burst of 0.8 mm isopropyl-thio-β-d-galactosidase at an OD595 of about 1. Cells were harvested 4 h later and disrupted in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, with 0.3 mm dithiothreitol and 10 μm ZnSO4which was used throughout the purification unless otherwise stated. Cells were lysed by sonication before centrifugation for 60 min at 48,000 × g. Human class II ADH was isolated as described previously (18Svensson S. Hedberg J.J. Höög J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) while the rodent ADHs were isolated by DEAE-cellulose (DE-52, Whatman, 150 ml) chromatography followed by AMP-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 10 ml) chromatography. The void volume from the first purification step containing rodent ADH was applied to the AMP-Sepharose column, washed with 40 ml of 0.1m potassium phosphate, 0.2 m NaCl, pH 7.5, before elution with 2.5 mm NAD+ in 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, with 0.3 mmdithiothreitol and 10 μm ZnSO4. Isolated class II ADH was subjected to buffer change to 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), concentration (Microsep 30K, Pall Filtron) and purity analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Protein concentration was determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as standard complemented with amino acid analysis on a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech AlphaPlus analyzer. The zinc content of mouse wild-type class II ADH was analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy (Perkin Elmer 5000 Zeeman) using a flame at standard conditions with deuterium background correction. Enzyme activity was monitored with a Hitachi U-3000 spectrophotometer by following the conversion of NAD+ (ε340 6.22 mm−1cm−1) with exception for oxidation of all-trans-retinol (ε400 29.5 mm−1 cm−1) (25Yang Z.N. Davis G.J. Hurley T.D. Stone C.L. Li T.K. Bosron W.F. Alcohol Clin. Exp. Res. 1994; 18: 587-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) and menadione where activity was monitored with 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazo-2-yl-]2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (ε610 11.3 mm−1cm−1) as described previously for DT-diaphorase (26Chen S. Hwang J. Deng P.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 72-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Alcohol oxidation activity was assayed in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, and in 0.1 m glycine/NaOH, pH 10.0, at 25 °C with 2.4 mm NAD+ while reductase activity was assayed in 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.5, with NADH concentrations of 0.2 mm. For quinone reduction, 0.1 mm NADH was used instead. If not else stated, reagents were from Sigma and of the highest purity readily available. Octanol and [1,1-2H2]octanol were synthesized by lithium aluminum hydride and lithium aluminum deuteride (Merck) reduction, respectively, of octanoic acid in ether. After ether/1m NaOH extraction and subsequent distillation, the synthesis was confirmed by GC/MS analysis and the deuterium content of [1,1-2H2]octanol was determined to 98%. Benzaldehyde and acetaldehyde were distilled before use. 4-Hydroxyoctenal, kindly supplied by the late Professor H. Esterbauer, was stored at −20 °C in chloroform which was evaporated under nitrogen immediately before use and the concentration determined spectrophotometrically at 224 nm (ε224 13.75 mm−1 cm−1). Stock solutions of substrates and inhibitors were prepared in methanol yielding a final concentration of 2% except for ethanol, acetaldehyde, and pyrazole derivatives which were dissolved in water and all-trans-retinol which was dissolved in acetone. Class II ADHs were neither active toward nor inhibited by methanol while acetone gave a partial inhibition. Activity measurements with 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzyl alcohol were corrected for absorbance of the corresponding aldehydes (ε340 22.0 mm−1 cm−1 and ε34023.3 mm−1 cm−1, respectively). The extent of non-enzymatic p-benzoquinone reduction was determined for each concentration and was subtracted from the values obtained for the enzymatic reaction. The dependence of the activity of mouse class II ADH on the concentration of ammonia (1–20 mm) was studied with benzyl alcohol and octanol in 0.1 m glycine/NaOH, pH 9.4 (27Inoue J. Tomioka N. Itai A. Harayama S. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3305-3311Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The ammonia stock solution was titrated to pH 9.4 with hydrochloric acid. To fit lines to data points and to calculate kinetic parameters a weighted nonlinear regression analysis program was used (Fig.P for Windows; Biosoft) while inhibition data was analyzed with the programs of Cleland (28Cleland W.W. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 103-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (1929) Google Scholar). All kinetic parameters are based on measurements performed with 2–4 preparations of enzyme. Thek cat values are per subunit (40 kDa) and standard errors were less than 10%. Standard errors forK m values were less than 15%. Frozen organs from mouse strain C57BL/6 (B6) and Harlan-Sprague Dawley rat were homogenized in 10 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.0, and centrifuged for 15 min at 20,000 × g. 5 μg of total protein from the homogenates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis together with recombinantly expressed human class I-III ADH (100 ng) and mouse class II ADH as controls. Proteins were transferred by electroblotting to poly(vinylidene difluoride) transfer membranes (Bio-Rad) which were subsequently blocked with 5% non-fat dry milk (Semper) in 10 mm Tris/Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0. The membranes were incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of rabbit antiserum raised against human class II ADH (18Svensson S. Hedberg J.J. Höög J.O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 251: 236-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) in 10 mm Tris/Cl, 150 mm NaCl, 1% non-fat dry milk, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 8.0, washed, and incubated with a 1:2000 dilution of Protein A-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad). Immunodetection was performed according to the ECLTM method protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA from mouse liver and kidney tissues were isolated by acid guanidinium thiocyanate/phenol/chloroform extraction according to the method described by Chomczynski and Sacchi (29Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63230) Google Scholar). Poly(A)-enriched RNA was obtained by mRNA purification with the OligotexTMmRNA kit (Qiagen). 0.5 μg from each tissue was subjected to electrophoresis in 1% agarose and blotted to a nylon transfer membrane (Hybond-N+TM, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Class II mRNA was probed with a 311-bp cDNA fragment chosen for its low similarity with other ADH cDNAs (bp 337–648 in the cDNA), and a 2-kilobase fragment of human β-actin cDNA (CLONTECH) was used as a control. The probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP to a specific activity of 5 × 108 cpm/μg (megaprime DNA labeling system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C overnight in 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE (1 × = 0.15m NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4), 10 × Denhardt's solution (1 × = 0.02% Ficoll, 0.02% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.02% bovine serum albumin), 2% SDS, and 1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Filters were washed with high stringency in 0.1 × SSC (1 × = 0.15 mNaCl, 15 mm sodium citrate, pH 7.6), 0.1% SDS before exposure to Kodak X-Omat films for 1–7 days using intensifying screens. A cloning strategy based on the high sequence identity of earlier characterized class II ADHs in the regions around amino acid residues 79 and 241 was used to PCR amplify a 500-bp fragment of the mouse class II ADH cDNA. The full-length cDNA was thereafter isolated from an adaptor ligated mouse liver cDNA library using the rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique. The entire cDNA sequence, covering 1354 bp, included a 1131-bp coding region, a 23-bp 5′ noncoding region, a 200-bp 3′ noncoding region, a poly(A) signal, and a poly(A) tail (Fig. 1). The region around the translation start codon was similar to that of the corresponding human form but lacked similarities with the consensus sequence, CCRCCATGR, except for ATG and the purines at position −3 and +4 (30Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 3873-3893Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The cDNA translated into a 376-amino acid polypeptide that had a sequence identity of 93.1% with rat class II ADH. A relative rate test of divergence versus ostrich class II ADH showed higher positional identities with ostrich for the human and rabbit isoforms (68–70%) than for the mouse and rat forms (65–66%). Still, it could not be excluded that differences in identities might be explained by the natural higher rates of nucleotide substitutions in rodents than in man (31Wu C.I. Li W.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1741-1745Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar). The phylogenetic tree of class I-IV ADHs showed generally longer branches in the class II line indicating faster divergence than for class I, III, and IV (Fig.2). The short separation distance between rat and mouse class II as compared with the other class II forms is not compatible with the general assumption of a uniform divergence rate for the same enzyme in different species. Alignments of all structurally characterized class II ADHs revealed three variable regions around positions 60, 120, and 300 with insertions and deletions as compared with the ADH consensus sequence. Within these regions there are two deletions specific for the rodent class II ADHs and a 4-residue insertion around position 119, that is common to all characterized class II ADHs. A single residue is deleted at either position 57 or 59, equal alignment scores, and two residues are deleted at positions 299–300. Deviations from the consensus sequence of ADHs were found at three coenzyme binding positions, 47, 51, and 182. The latter corresponds to 178 in the class I ADH numbering system, a residue positioned on the opposite side of the nicotinamide ring as compared with the substrate. The otherwise conserved Thr was Ser in both rodent class II ADHs while the His at either position 47 or 51, common in most ADHs, were lacking. The effects of these replacements were studied by site-directed mutagenesis and three mutants were created, denoted P47H, N51H, and S182T. The distribution of class II ADH in 13 mouse and rat tissues were studied by immunoblot analysis with antiserum raised against human class II ADH. A strong immunoreactive signal was found in liver and a weaker signal in kidney (Fig.3). However, a more specific Northern blot analysis of mouse liver and kidney with a mouse class II cDNA probe revealed that detectable amounts of class II ADH mRNA was only expressed in liver (Fig. 4). This indicates that the immunoreactive signal from kidney probably is of another origin.Figure 4Autoradiograms from Northern blot analysis of class II ADH in mouse liver and kidney. Northern blot analysis was performed on 0.5 μg of poly(A)-enriched RNA prepared from mouse liver and kidney samples. Hybridizations were carried out with an 311-bp cDNA probe against class II mRNA (A) and a 2-kilobase fragment of human β-actin cDNA (B).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Class II ADHs were expressed recombinantly and isolated by ion exchange and affinity chromatography. Expression yields were 15–20 mg/liter culture medium. The same isolation protocol with pET29 expression plasmid without cDNA insert yielded roughly 100 μg/liter of protein exhibiting no acetaldehyde or p-benzoquinone reducing activity, which indicates a purity over 99% which was also confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The zinc content was determined for the mouse wild-type enzyme to 2.2 mol/mol subunit indicating one active and one structural zinc per subunit. The alcohol oxidation, aldehyde reduction, and quinone reduction activities of rodent class II ADHs were investigated and compared with those of the human class II enzyme. Ethanol, octanol, benzyl alcohol, and their corresponding aldehydes together with benzoquinone were used as model substrates for these activities (Tables Iand II). The alcohol dehydrogenase reaction was catalyzed dramatically less efficient by the rodent forms as compared with the human form. Turnover numbers were more than 10-fold lower and saturation was reached at far higher concentrations. In the case of ethanol, none of the rodent class II forms were saturated with substrate. The reduction of aldehydes was more efficiently catalyzed by the rodent forms than alcohol oxidation, still turnover numbers were 5–10-fold lower than for the human form. In contrast, benzoquinone reduction proceeded with about the same turnover rate for all species forms, although the K m values were lower for the human form. The substrate and inhibitor repertoire of mouse class II ADH was more thoroughly investigated (TableIII). The activity for class II ADH characteristic substrates such as benzyl alcohol derivatives and 4-hydroxyoctenal were more than 100-fold lower than has been reported for human class II ADH. Neither activity nor inhibition of benzyl alcohol oxidation was observed for the retinoids, steroids, and endogenous quinones tested. Pyrazole and 4-methylpyrazole were poor inhibitors while the halogenated derivative, 4-bromopyrazole, gave stronger inhibition, a pattern resembling that of the human form of the enzyme (32Bosron W.F. Li T.K. Dafeldecker W.P. Vallee B.L. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1101-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). However, mouse class II ADH showed extremely low activity for the three ω-hydroxy fatty acids investigated and was potently inhibited by these compounds at both pH 7.5 and 10.0 (Fig.5). Inhibition constants were determined at pH 10.0 by varying the octanol and inhibitor concentration at saturating NAD+. Competitive inhibition patterns were obtained and K is values were determined to 26 ± 7 μm, 6.0 ± 0.7 μm, and 6.9 ± 0.7 μm for 10-HDA, 12-HDA, and 16-HHA, respectively (Fig. 5). The importance of the carboxylic acid group for efficient binding was evident from the high affinity of octanoic acid (Fig. 5). Moreover, uncompetitive inhibition patterns were obtained when NAD+ and 12-HDA were varied at subsaturating concentrations of 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol or octanol and gave K iivalues of 5.0 ± 0.4 μm and 14 ± 1.8 μm, respectively (Fig. 5). This result is consistent with an ordered mechanism for alcohol oxidation with NAD+binding as first reactant (33Fromm H.J. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 467-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), a mechanism also observed for human class II ADH (32Bosron W.F. Li T.K. Dafeldecker W.P. Vallee B.L.

https://openalex.org/W1990368876,"Maspin is a tumor suppressor protein expressed by normal human mammary epithelium but not by many breast tumor cell lines. Recombinant human maspin (rMaspin) inhibits tumor cell motility, invasion, and metastasis and thus has potential value as an anti-cancer therapeutic. Maspin is a member of the serpin family and, although the molecular mechanism by which maspin acts is unknown, recent work suggests that tissue plasminogen activator is a potential target. A puzzling observation in previous cell culture studies was loss of rMaspin activity at higher protein concentrations. One hypothesis to explain these results is self-association of rMaspin at the higher concentrations, which would be consistent with the tendency of serpins to form noncovalent polymers. This hypothesis is addressed by examining the relationship between rMaspin stability and self-association. Urea denaturation of rMaspin at pH 7 and 25 °C and at protein concentrations ranging from 0.01 to 0.2 mg/ml has been monitored by circular dichroism and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence. Denaturation profiles show a protein concentration dependence and indicate the presence of at least one unfolding intermediate. The results suggest that destabilization of native monomeric rMaspin leads to partial unfolding and formation of an intermediate which can self-associate.

The results suggest that destabilization of native monomeric rMaspin leads to partial unfolding and formation of an intermediate which can self-associate. recombinant maspin reactive-site loop tissue-type plasminogen activator Maspin is a tumor-suppressing protein (M r42,138) that was originally identified in normal human breast epithelial and myoepithelial cells (1Zou Z. Anisowicz A. Hendrix M.J.C. Thor A. Neveu M. Sheng S. Rafidi K. Seftor E. Sager R. Science. 1994; 263: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Maspin has subsequently been localized to epithelial and myoepithelial cells in a variety of tissues (2Pemberton P.A. Tipton A.R. Pavloff N. Smith J. Erickson J.R. Mouchabeck Z.M. Kiefer M.C. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1997; 45: 1697-1706Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Maspin expression is decreased or lost in most breast carcinoma cell lines and tissue (1Zou Z. Anisowicz A. Hendrix M.J.C. Thor A. Neveu M. Sheng S. Rafidi K. Seftor E. Sager R. Science. 1994; 263: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar) and its expression is down-regulated in metastatic prostate carcinoma cells as well (3Zhang M. Magit D. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5673-5678Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 4Umekita Y. Hiipakka R.A. Liao S. Cancer Lett. 1997; 113: 87-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Overexpression of maspin in breast carcinoma cell lines leads to decreased cell motility, invasiveness, and metastasis (1Zou Z. Anisowicz A. Hendrix M.J.C. Thor A. Neveu M. Sheng S. Rafidi K. Seftor E. Sager R. Science. 1994; 263: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). These results suggest that maspin plays a key role in inhibiting the progression of breast cancer and, possibly, prostate cancer. One very interesting observation with regard to both the mechanism and possible therapeutic potential of maspin is that addition of exogenous recombinant maspin (rMaspin)1to cultured breast carcinoma cells lines leads to decreased cell motility and invasiveness (5Sheng S.

These results are in line with recent studies of conditioned medium from myoepithelial cell cultures: this medium inhibits motility and invasiveness of breast cancer cells and these activities are lost after removal of maspin from the medium (8Sternlicht M.D. Kedeshian P. Shao Z.-M. Safarians S. Barsky S.H. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 1949-1953PubMed Google Scholar,9Shao Z.M. Nguyen M. Alpaugh M.L. O'Connell J.T. Barsky S.H. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 241: 394-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Naturally occurring maspin and rMaspin thus must act at an extracellular site or be transported across the plasma membrane to an intracellular site of action. One possible target for maspin is tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) (10Sheng S. Truong B. Frederickson D. Wu R. Pardee A.B. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), although there is some disagreement on this point (11Pemberton P.A. Wong D.T. Gibson H.L. Kiefer M.C. Fitzpatrick P.A. Sager R. Barr P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15832-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the fact that exogenous rMaspin is active suggests that rMaspin holds promise as a potential anti-cancer therapeutic. The inhibitory effect of rMaspin on cancer cell motility and invasiveness shows a curious dose-response relationship: activity increases with increasing rMaspin concentration up to about 0.2 μm protein and then falls with further increases in protein concentration (5Sheng S. Pemberton P.A. Sager R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30988-30993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One possible explanation for this behavior may be found in an analogous effect of rMaspin on tPA in vitro, where concentrations of rMaspin below 0.5 μminhibit fibrinogen-activated tPA while higher concentrations stimulate tPA activity (10Sheng S. Truong B. Frederickson D. Wu R. Pardee A.B. Sager R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 499-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). However, a role for tPA in breast cancer cell motility and invasion has not yet been established. Another hypothesis to explain the curious concentration dependence of rMaspin activity in cell culture is self-association of rMaspin (5Sheng S. Pemberton P.A. Sager R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30988-30993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This hypothesis is supported by the fact that maspin belongs to the serpin family and members of this family show a tendency to self-associate (e.g. Refs. 12Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 13Mikus P. Ny T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1999; 274: 9548-9555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Self-association of serpins generally involves a structural feature known as the reactive-site loop (RSL) and one of the three β-sheets, A through C, found in all serpins (16Whisstock J. Skinner R. Lesk A.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 63-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The RSL of one molecule can insert into either the A or C sheet of another molecule (12Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nature Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). A related intramolecular association occurs between the RSL and the A-sheet of many serpins as part of an extraordinary conformational change from a metastable biologically active state (also known as the stressed or S state) to a more stable latent state (also known as the relaxed or R state). rMaspin does not undergo the S to R transition, but results of electrophoretic studies suggest that rMaspin self-associates when subjected to mild perturbations in solution conditions (11Pemberton P.A. Wong D.T. Gibson H.L. Kiefer M.C. Fitzpatrick P.A. Sager R. Barr P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15832-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The goal of the present study is to develop a better understanding of the relationship between the structure and anti-cancer activity of rMaspin by focusing more closely on the relationship between stability and self-association of rMaspin. Urea denaturation of rMaspin at a variety of protein concentrations has been monitored by circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence spectroscopy. The solution structure of rMaspin in the absence of urea has been investigated by analytical ultracentrifugation at 25 and 40 °C. Results of the present study demonstrate that native rMaspin at pH 7.0 is monomeric but that urea denaturation of rMaspin is a multistate reaction in which an intermediate state undergoes self-association. rMaspin was purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae as described previously (11Pemberton P.A. Wong D.T. Gibson H.L. Kiefer M.C. Fitzpatrick P.A. Sager R. Barr P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15832-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). rMaspin is >95% pure as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Biological activity of the same batch of rMaspin has been demonstrated in cell culture studies (7Seftor R.E.B. Seftor E.A. Sheng S. Pemberton P.A. Sager R. Hendrix M.J.C. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5681-5685PubMed Google Scholar). Crystallized and ultrapure urea was purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals (Indianapolis, IN). All other chemicals were obtained from Fisher Scientific (Fair Lawn, NJ) or EM Science (Gibbstown, NJ) and were reagent grade or better. Water was deionized and glass-distilled. All buffer solutions were passed through 0.45-μm filters and degassed. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were conducted on a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with a An-60 Ti rotor. Six-channel equilibrium center pieces were used. Protein concentrations of 9.5 μm (0.4 mg/ml) and 36 μm (1.5 mg/ml) were examined at pH 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0. The pH 6.0 and 7.0 solutions contained 50 mm sodium phosphate and 0.1 m NaCl while the pH 5.0 solutions contained 50 mm sodium acetate and 0.1 mNaCl. Absorbance was monitored at 280 nm in all samples. Samples at 25 °C were centrifuged at 10,000, 12,000, and 17,500 rpm and those at 40 °C were centrifuged at 10,000 and 17,500 rpm. These samples were then subjected to 40,000 rpm to deplete the meniscus of protein, which facilitates measurement of baseline absorbance values. Data were analyzed using the ORIGINTM software (version 3.78, Microcal Software, Northampton, MA) supplied with the ultracentrifuge and running on an IBM PC. The partial specific volume,ν̄, of rMaspin was calculated to be 0.716 ml/g on the basis of amino acid composition (17Zamyatin A.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng. 1984; 13: 145-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The calculated solution density, ρ, for the pH 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0 samples was 1.004, 1.007, and 1.008 g/ml, respectively (18Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge1992: 91-125Google Scholar). The apparent molecular weight of rMaspin, M, was determined by fitting absorbance,A, as a function of radial position, r, to the following equation for an ideal solution containing a single species (19Hansen J.C. Lebowitz J. Demeler B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13155-13163Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar),A(r)=A(r0)exp[M(1−ν̄ρ)ω2(r2−r02)/2RT]+A0Equation 1 where r 0 is the radial position of the meniscus, ω is the angular velocity of the rotor, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, andA 0 is the baseline absorbance in the absence of protein. CD data were acquired on an AVIV 62DS spectropolarimeter equipped with a thermoelectric temperature controller. Protein solutions were passed through 0.45-μm filters and degassed prior to data acquisition. Far-UV CD spectra were obtained at 25 °C with samples containing 5 mm sodium phosphate and 4.8 μm (0.20 mg/ml) rMaspin. A 0.1-cm path length cuvette was used, spectra were collected at 0.5-nm intervals with an averaging time of 2 s and two scans were averaged. Fluorescence data were obtained on a Fluorolog-3 spectrofluorometer (Jobin Yvon-Spex Instruments, Edison, NJ) equipped with a circulating water bath for temperature control. Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was excited at 295 nm. Excitation and emission band widths were 2.5 nm, data were collected at 1-nm intervals, and two scans were averaged for each spectrum. Urea denaturation experiments were done at pH 7.0 with solutions containing 100 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmNa2-EDTA and the indicated concentration of urea. Buffer solutions containing approximately 9 m urea were prepared just prior to each experiment and the concentration of urea was determined by refractometry (20Pace C.N. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 266-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar). A concentrated stock solution of native rMaspin in 100 mm sodium phosphate was diluted into buffer solutions containing the desired concentrations of urea. When examining the ability of rMaspin to refold out of concentrated urea, the stock solution of rMaspin also contained 8 m urea. The final concentration of protein was the same throughout a given experiment and was varied from 0.24 μm (0.01 mg/ml) to 4.8 μm (0.2 mg/ml) between experiments. Samples were equilibrated at the indicated temperature for approximately 16 h prior to making spectroscopic measurements. No differences were observed in experiments where spectroscopic measurements were made after more extended equilibration. The concentration of rMaspin was determined using a calculated extinction coefficient for native rMaspin of 18,450 m−1 cm−1 at 280 nm (21Pace C.N. Vajdos F. Fee L. Grimsley G. Gray T. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2411-2423Crossref PubMed Scopus (3418) Google Scholar). The same protein solutions were used for CD and fluorescence measurements of urea denaturation. For CD measurements at 222 nm, a 1-cm path length cuvette was used for solutions containing 0.24 and 1.2 μm rMaspin and a 0.2-cm path length cuvette was used for 4.8 μm solutions of rMaspin. The averaging time was 2 s and the reported signal is the mean for data collected over a 2-min period. Fluorescence spectra were acquired as described above. The intensity weighted average emission wavelength (22Royer C.A. Mann C.J. Matthews C.R. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 1844-1852Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) was calculated from emission spectra collected from 305 to 500 nm. One hypothesis to explain the loss of rMaspin activity at concentrations greater than 0.2 μm is formation of biologically inactive multimers. This hypothesis was tested using equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation. The results suggest that, in the absence of other contributing factors, the hypothesis may be incorrect: at pH 7.0, native rMaspin is monomeric at concentrations approaching 20 μm at both 25 and 40 °C (Fig. 1). Solutions containing higher concentrations of rMaspin show clear evidence for non-ideality (data not shown), leading to apparent molecular weights that are less than expected on the basis of sequence data. In cell culture studies, the pH of the medium declines over time as a consequence of cellular metabolism. To investigate the possibility that such a decrease in pH leads to self-association of rMaspin, the protein was subjected to analytical ultracentrifugation at more acidic pH. The results at pH 6 are similar to those seen at pH 7: native rMaspin is monomeric (Fig. 1). At pH 5 and 25 °C, rMaspin forms a visible precipitate at all concentrations and the solutions are not suitable for quantitative analysis of sedimentation behavior. Acidic pH thus leads to self-association of rMaspin. However, the pH of cell culture medium is not likely to fall below pH 6, so we conclude that acidification of cell culture medium is not sufficient to drive self-association of rMaspin. The centrifugation experiments were conducted in simple phosphate or acetate buffer solutions containing 100 mm NaCl, while cell culture medium contains a host of other components that may contribute to self-association of rMaspin. Results of previous studies demonstrated that rMaspin is indeed capable of undergoing self-association at moderately acidic or basic pH, or at pH 7.4 and temperatures greater than 40 °C (11Pemberton P.A. Wong D.T. Gibson H.L. Kiefer M.C. Fitzpatrick P.A. Sager R. Barr P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15832-15837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). However, these studies explored a relatively small set of solution conditions, so chemical denaturation has been used in the present study to obtain a more complete and precise understanding of rMaspin stability and self-association. Urea denaturation of rMaspin at concentrations ranging from 0.24 to 4.8 μm has been monitored by both far-UV CD at 222 nm (Fig. 2 A) and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 2 B) at pH 7 and 25 °C. The urea denaturation profiles monitored by CD and fluorescence are in qualitative agreement on two major points: the denaturation profiles are sensitive to protein concentration and at least two distinct transitions are observed at rMaspin concentrations >0.24 μm. The chemical denaturation of rMaspin must thus involve at least three states: native (N), an intermediate (I), and the denatured or unfolded (U) state. The ultracentrifugation experiments show that N is monomeric in these solution conditions, so the protein concentration dependence must result from self-association of the I or U states. The transition from I to U is stabilized against urea denaturation by increasing protein concentration. This suggests that I undergoes self-association to a greater extent than U. Further evidence for self-association of I is found in the fluorescence data: the Rayleigh scattering peak increases in intensity at urea concentrations between the two transitions and returns to relatively low values upon completion of the second transition (data not shown). The simplest model that is consistent with the data is as follows,nN⇌[nI⇌In]⇌UEquation 2 where n is the stoichiometry of the association reaction, which is not yet known. The square bracketsindicate an equilibrium between monomeric and multimeric Ithat could be either on or off the direct pathway for unfolding. In either case, this model predicts that the transition from N to I should occur at lower urea concentrations with increasing protein concentration. This is not evident from the CD data in Fig.2 A, but changes in the transition midpoints may be masked by the complexity of the denaturation profiles. Ideally, least squares analysis of the denaturation profiles would be used to obtain estimates for the thermodynamics of rMaspin denaturation and self-association. In the case of rMaspin, this type of analysis is confounded at present by a lack of knowledge concerning the stoichiometry of self-association and by incomplete reversibility of denaturation: dilution of rMaspin out of 8 m urea only leads to partial recovery of the spectroscopic signals (Fig.3). The extent of recovery depends on protein concentration, so the irreversible reaction involves self-association of rMaspin. The stability of rMaspin has been measured at 37 °C to investigate the possibility that partial unfolding and self-association are more likely at the temperature of cell culture studies. Urea denaturation of 1.2 μm rMaspin at pH 7.0 and 37 °C (Fig. 4) shows at least two interesting differences relative to data obtained at 25 °C. First, the midpoint of the initial transition occurs at a lower urea concentration, about 1.6 m at 37 °C versus about 1.9 mat 25 °C, suggesting that native rMaspin is less stable at the higher temperature. Second, the midpoint of the second transition occurs at a higher urea concentration, about 3.5 m versus approximately 3 m at 25 °C. The partially unfolded and multimeric I state of rMaspin is thus stabilized at the higher temperature. Overall, rMaspin is more likely to undergo partial unfolding and self-association at 37 °C than at 25 °C. The conformational changes associated with the denaturation and self-association of rMaspin have been investigated by CD and fluorescence. Urea denaturation monitored by far-UV CD suggests that the transition from N to I involves a significant loss of secondary structure (Fig. 2 A). Comparison of far-UV CD spectra in the presence and absence of urea further substantiates this conclusion (Fig. 5 A). In the absence of urea, the CD spectrum is dominated by a minimum at about 222 nm and a maximum at 196 nm. A molecular model for native rMaspin has been generated on the basis of its homology to ovalbumin (23Fitzpatrick P.A. Wong D.T. Barr P.J. Pemberton P.A. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 585-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The predicted secondary structure content is approximately 30% helix, 30% β-strand, 10% β-turn, with the balance in irregular structure. These values have been used as input into Equation 11 of Yang and co-workers (24Yang J.T. Wu C.-S. Martinez H.M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 130: 208-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1732) Google Scholar) to predict mean residue ellipticities for native rMaspin. Predicted values of −12,000 and +20,000 deg·cm2 dmol−1 at 222 and 196 nm, respectively, are similar to the observed values of −12,500 deg·cm2 dmol−1 and +16,000 deg·cm2 dmol−1. CD data are thus consistent with the homology model for rMaspin. rMaspin in 8 m urea has no detectable secondary structure as measured by CD (Fig. 5 A). The CD spectrum under conditions where the intermediate, I, is well populated suggests a loss of secondary structure relative to N, as judged by the general decrease in intensity. Estimates for the secondary structure content of I are difficult because absorbance by urea precludes measurements below 207 nm, but the data suggest that a significant loss of helical structure occurs in the transition from N to I. The fluorescence spectrum for rMaspin reports primarily on the environment of its two tryptophan residues, Trp-171 and Trp-258 (25Eftink M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 259: 487-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The wavelength of maximum emission intensity, λmax, for native rMaspin is 343 nm and this shifts to 358 nm when rMaspin is denatured in 8 m urea (Fig. 5 B). The latter value is as expected for solvent-exposed tryptophan side chains. The blue-shifted λmax for native rMaspin indicates that one or both of the tryptophan side chains is at least partially buried in the nonpolar interior of native rMaspin. The partial unfolding of N to I is associated primarily with small changes in fluorescence intensity and, possibly, a very modest red shift of λmax (Fig. 5 B). Thus, the environment of the tryptophan residues appears to be undergoing relatively modest changes in the transition from N to I. In contrast, λmaxundergoes a significant red shift in the transition from I to U, suggesting that buried tryptophan residues are exposed to solvent in this transition. Chemical denaturation of rMaspin is a multistep process involving at least one intermediate, I, in addition to the native, N, and unfolded species, U. The spectral properties of U are consistent with a disordered polypeptide backbone and tryptophan residues that are well exposed to solvent. The denaturation profile is sensitive to protein concentration and this appears to result from self-association of I. Fluorescence data suggest that one or both of the tryptophan residues are buried in both N and I, but CD data indicate that I contains much less secondary structure than N. Much of the change in secondary structure appears to be loss of helix. Detailed structural information is available for a small number of equilibrium unfolding intermediates in other proteins. The intermediates show native-like structure in a portion of the molecule while the rest of the protein is largely disordered (26Raschke T.M. Marqusee S. Curr. Opin. Biotech. 1998; 9: 80-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). On this basis, the molecular model for native rMaspin can be used to generate hypotheses regarding possible structure in the I state. All serpins of known structure share a very similar overall fold (16Whisstock J. Skinner R. Lesk A.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 63-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). A model for the structure of maspin has been constructed on the basis of significant sequence identity with a serpin of known structure, ovalbumin (23Fitzpatrick P.A. Wong D.T. Barr P.J. Pemberton P.A. Protein Eng. 1996; 9: 585-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 27Stein P.E. Leslie A.G. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 221: 941-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The fold is dominated by the extensive β-sheet A, which bridges two major domains. One domain is rich in β structure and includes the RSL while the other domain consists of mixed α/β structure. Sequence alignment suggests that Trp-171 and Trp-258 of maspin correspond to Trp-184 and Trp-267 of ovalbumin. Both tryptophan residues are located in the domain that is rich in β structure. The transition from N to I in rMaspin is accompanied by changes in tryptophan fluorescence intensity and an almost negligible red shift in λmax. This suggests that the tertiary structure in the β-rich domain is largely intact in I. In contrast, the far-UV CD data suggest a significant loss of helical structure. Most of the helical structure is located in a mixed α/β domain that is distal to the RSL. These observations lead to the hypothesis that I consists of a partially disordered α/β domain and a largely intact β-rich domain. Self-association of I may result from exposure of hydrophobic surfaces in the partially folded molecule or from insertion of the RSL into either β-sheet A or C, which appears to be the case for a number of other serpins (e.g. Refs. 14Carrell R.W. Gooptu B. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1998; 8: 799-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar and 15Dafforn T.R. Mahadeva R. Elliott P.R. Sivasothy P. Lomas D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9548-9555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The fluorescence and far-UV CD spectra for the I state are very similar to those for equilibrium and kinetic intermediates in the folding of ovalbumin (28Onda M. Tatsumi E. Takahashi N. Hirose M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3973-3979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), although no self-association was observed in these studies. Lomas and co-workers (15Dafforn T.R.

Chem. 1999; 274: 9548-9555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) have recently illuminated the relationship between partial unfolding and self-association of α1-antitrypsin. More generally, the three-state chemical denaturation profile for rMaspin closely resembles those for other serpins such as α1-antitrypsin, antithrombin III, α1-antichymotrypsin, C1 inhibitor, and plasminogen activator inhibitor I (29Bruch M. Weiss V. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16626-16630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Hervé M. Ghélis C. Eur. J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 2509-2516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Ovalbumin is a clear exception in this regard and undergoes a more cooperative two-state unfolding reaction (29Bruch M. Weiss V. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16626-16630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For serpins that have undergone the S to R transition, chemical denaturation profiles are shifted toward higher denaturant concentrations and, in some cases, appear to reflect two-state transitions (29Bruch M. Weiss V. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16626-16630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Powell L.M. Pain R.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 241-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Experimental and computational studies of multidomain proteins suggest that the cooperativity of denaturation reflects the properties of interfaces between domains (34Freire E. Murphy K.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 687-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 35Freire E. Murphy K.P. Sanchez-Ruiz J.M. Galisteo M.L. Privalov P.L.

One hypothesis that follows from this analysis is that more cooperative transitions are observed in serpins that have more extensive interdomain interactions. This hypothesis may be testable with the rapidly growing data base of serpin structures (16Whisstock J. Skinner R. Lesk A.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 63-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). In the case of rMaspin, the cooperativity of denaturation also reflects self-association of an intermediate, I. In fact, CD and fluorescence spectra for I (Fig. 5) are probably dominated by contributions from multimeric I species. Self-association of intermediate states may also explain the three-state chemical denaturation profiles observed for other serpins (29Bruch M. Weiss V. Engel J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16626-16630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 30Hervé M. Ghélis C. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 191: 653-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 31Powell L.M. Pain R.H.

Does self-association of rMaspin explain its unusual dose-response behavior in studies of breast cancer cell motility and invasiveness? Native rMaspin does not self-associate but partially unfolded rMaspin undergoes self-association at concentrations where decreases in biological activity are observed. However, native rMaspin appears to be relatively stable at pH 7 and 37 °C (Fig. 4). These results suggest that, under the solution conditions examined in the present study, rMaspin does not self-associate to a significant extent. In principle, questions remain regarding the possible effect of other cell medium components on self-association. Indirect evidence indicates the real potential for such an effect: self-association of rMaspin appears to be induced by a chromogenic peptide substrate for plasmin. 2T. Liu, P. A. Pemberton, and A. D. Robertson, unpublished results. An alternative approach will be to examine the possibility that peptide bond cleavage in the RSL of rMaspin leads to self-association with intact rMaspin. rMaspin is very prone to partial proteolysis in the RSL (11Pemberton P.A.

The binding enthalpies, ΔHb, are the same at both temperatures, and the values range from −10.94 to −47.11 kJ mol−1. The affinities of artocarpin as obtained from isothermal titration calorimetry are in reasonable agreement with the results obtained by enzyme-linked lectin absorbent essay, which is based on the minimum amount of ligand required to inhibit horseradish peroxidase binding to artocarpin in enzyme-linked lectin absorbent essay (Misquith, S., Rani, P. G., and Surolia, A. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 30393–30401). The interactions are mainly enthalpically driven and exhibit enthalpy-entropy compensation. The order of binding affinity of artocarpin is as follows: mannotriose>Manα3Man>GlcNAc2Man3>MeαMan>Man>Manα6Man>Manα2Man>MeαGlc>Glc,i.e. 7>4>2>1.4>1>0.4>0.3>0.24>0.11. The ΔH for the interaction of Manα3Man, Manα6Man, and MeαMan are similar and 20 kJ mol−1 lower than that of mannotriose. This indicates that, while Manα3Man and Manα6Man interact with the lectin exclusively through their nonreducing end monosaccharide with the subsites specific for the α1,3 and α1,6 arms, the mannotriose interacts with the lectin simultaneously through all three of its mannopyranosyl residues. This study thus underscores the distinction in the recognition of this common oligosaccharide motif in comparison with that displayed by other lectins with related specificity.

Recognition of glycoconjugates is an important event in biological systems and is frequently in the form of carbohydrate-protein interactions. The study of how biological molecules interact with one another is fundamental to understanding the chemistry of life. Among the carbohydrate binding proteins, lectins are a group of proteins or glycoproteins which stereospecifically bind carbohydrates (1Sharon N. Lis H. Chemistry in Britain. Royal Society of Chemistry, London1990Google Scholar).N-Linked oligomannose-type carbohydrates constitute one class of oligosaccharide chains associated with cellular glycoproteins. The oligosaccharide chains of many of the glycoproteins appear to function as receptors for lectins in a variety of biological recognition processes, such as fertilization, embryogenesis, cell migration, organ formation, immune defense, protein folding, signal transduction, and apoptosis (2Sharon N.

Detailed insights into the specificity of carbohydrate-protein interactions, however, require not only analytical data such as inhibition assays but also thermodynamic data on the complexes. Titration microcalorimetry provides a powerful tool for investigating the binding thermodynamics of macromolecule-ligand interactions and provide important insights on the nature and magnitude of forces involved therein (5Schwarz F.P.

Artocarpin, a mannose-specific lectin isolated from jack fruit seeds is a homotetrameric protein devoid of covalently attached carbohydrates and consists of four isolectins with pI in the range of 5–6.5. Artocarpin is of considerable interest because of its potent and selective mitogenic effect on distinct T and B-cell functions, more so because of its B-cell maturation mitogenic activity (12Bunn-Moreno M.M. Campos-Neto A. J. Immunol. 1981; 127: 427-429PubMed Google Scholar, 13de Miranda-Santos I.K.F. Mengel Jr., J.O. Bunn-Moreno M.M. Campos-Neto J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 140: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Earlier investigations of its carbohydrate binding specificity revealed that among monosaccharides, mannose is preferred over glucose. Among mannooligosaccharides, mannotriose (Manα1–3[Manα1–6]Man), and mannopentaose were noted as the strongest ligands followed by Manα1–3Man. Substitution of both the α1–3 or α1–6 linked mannosyl residues of mannotriose by GlcNAc in β1–2 linkage diminishes their inhibitory potencies (9Misquith S. Rani P.G. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30393-30401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this investigation, isothermal titration calorimetry was employed to determine the thermodynamics of the carbohydrate-artocarpin binding reaction in terms of the binding constant (Kb) and change in the free energies, enthalpies, and entropies, i.e.ΔGb 0, ΔHb 0, and ΔSb 0. Glucose (Glc), Mannose (Man), methyl-α-glucose (MeαGlc), methyl-α-mannopyranoside (MeαMan), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), andN-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) were obtained from Sigma. Methyl-β-mannopyranoside (MeβMan), Manα1–2Man, Manα1–3Man, Manα1–6Man, Manα1–3[Manα1–6]Man, GlcNAc2Man3, and mannopentaose were the products of Dextra Laboratories, London. All other reagents and chemicals were of the highest purity available. Artocarpin, purified as previously described (9Misquith S. Rani P.G. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30393-30401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was dialyzed overnight against 20 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.2 containing 150 mm sodium chloride (phosphate-buffered saline) and centrifuged to remove any insoluble material. The concentrations of the protein were determined spectrophotometrically (A 2801% = 10.8). Solutions of the carbohydrate were prepared by weight in the dialysate to minimize differences between the protein buffer solution and ligand buffer solution in the isothermal titration calorimetry measurements. Isothermal calorimetric titration measurements were performed using an OMEGA titration calorimeter from Microcal Inc. as described previously (5Schwarz F.P. Puri K. Rama B.G. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7668-7677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Garcia-Hernandez E. Zubillaga R.A. Rojo-Dominguez A. Rodriguez Romero A. Hernandez-Arana A. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1997; 29: 467-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). A circulating water bath was used to help temperature stabilization. The instrument was allowed to equilibrate overnight. Aliquots (5–10 μl) of the ligand solution (9–36 × protein binding sites) were added from the computer-controlled 250-μl rotating syringe stirring at 395 rpm at an interval of 3 min into the lectin solution (1.34 ml) containing 0.5–8 mm binding sites. The heat changes accompanying the ligand solutions to the lectin solution were recorded. The heat of dilution was determined to be negligible in separate titrations of the ligand solution into just the buffer solution. The total heat, Qt was then fitted via a nonlinear least squares minimization method to the total ligand concentration (Xt) using Equation 1 (14Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar),Qt=nMtΔHbV{1+Xt/nMt+1/nKbMt−[(1+Xt/nMt+1/nKbMt)]2−4Xt/nMt]}/2Equation 1 where n is the number of binding sites per monomer and V is the cell volume. The expression for the heat released per ith injection, dQ(i), is then given by Equation 2 (15Yang C.P. Omega Data in Origin. Microcal Inc., Northampton, MA1990: 66Google Scholar),ΔQ(i)=ΔQ(i)+dVi/2V[Q(i)+Q(i−1)]−Q(i−1)Equation 2 where dVi is the volume of titrant added to the solution. The parameters ΔGb 0 and ΔSb are calculated from the basic equations of thermodynamics according to Equations 3 and 4,ΔGb0=−RT lnKbEquation 3 TΔSb0=ΔHb−ΔGbEquation 4 The structures of ligands used in titration calorimetry experiments are depicted in Fig. 1. The results of a typical titration calorimetry measurement, which consisted of addition of 5-μl aliquots of Manα3Man (5 mm) to artocarpin (0.5 mm) in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, at 281 K are shown in Fig. 2. The results exhibit a monotonic decrease in the exothermic heat of binding till saturation is achieved. A least squares fit of the total heat released as a function of ligand concentration to the identical site model described by Equation 1 is also shown in Fig. 2. The close fit of the data to the identical site model shows that a molecule of ligand binds to each of the four sites of artocarpin independently and with the same binding constant and stoichiometry. The thermodynamic binding parameters of mannopyranosides and mannooligosaccharides to artocarpin are listed in Table I. All experiments were performed in the C value (C =Kb × Mt, whereMt is the macromolecular concentration) range of 1<C>20, except for Manα4Man where a C value of approximately 0.75 could only be achieved (binding site ∼ 8 mm). In most cases the standard deviations in the values ofK a and ΔH were within 5%, except for ligands such as glucose, mannose, MeαGlc, Manα2Man, etc. which have low affinity for artocarpin.Figure 2Calorimetric titration of artocarpin (0.5 mm) with Manα1–3Man (5 mm) at 281 K.

ND, indicates no detection. The thermodynamic parameters for the binding of mannose and mannooligosaccharide show that the binding reactions are essentially enthalpically driven with little dependence of the enthalpy on temperatures from 280.1 to 293.5 K. The values for ΔHb range from 47.11 kJ for mannotriose to 9.84 kJ for Manα1–2Man. The binding constants for different sugars range from 21,200 m−1 for mannopentaose to 150m−1 for glucose. The binding reactions for artocarpin to monosaccharides and mannooligosaccharides exhibit enthalpy-entropy compensation as shown in Fig.3. Whereas glucose and mannose bind to the lectin, albeit weakly, GlcNAc and ManNAc do not bind at all even at high concentrations (8 mm protein binding sites and 160 mm sugars). Binding of the lectin with Manα4Man is barely detected at the above concentrations, so much so that the thermodynamic parameters for its binding could not be ascertained. MeαMan, Manα3Man, and Manα6Man display similar changes in enthalpies (∼26–28 kJ mol−1), whereas mannotriose and mannopentaose exhibit 45–47 kJ mol−1 of ΔH values, viz. 20 kJ more favorable change in enthalpy over them. In an earlier study, artocarpin was demonstrated to differ considerably from all the other mannose/glucose binding lectins studied so far. Using an enzyme based assay, it was shown that among mannooligosaccharides artocarpin binds best to mannotriose and mannopentaose, highlighting the possibility of an extended combining region for these saccharides in the lectin (9Misquith S. Rani P.G. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30393-30401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To examine in greater detail the nature of these interactions, the binding of several monosaccharides and mannooligosaccharides to artocarpin was studied by isothermal titration calorimetry. In Table I, the values of the binding constants and resultant relative affinities determined by titration calorimetry are listed together with the relative potencies determined by inhibition assays using enzyme-linked lectin absorbent essay (ELLA) (9Misquith S. Rani P.G. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30393-30401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relative affinities for binding of these saccharides are in good agreement with the inhibition studies, except for GlcNAc2Man3which gives higher value of Kb from that expected from inhibition data (9Misquith S. Rani P.G. Surolia A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30393-30401Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thermodynamics of the interaction of artocarpin with mannose and mannooligosaccharides are essentially enthalpically driven and exhibit compensatory changes in ΔHb andTΔS as shown in Fig. 3. This compensatory behavior has been attributed to the accompanying changes in solvent reorganization. Reduction in soft vibrational modes restricting mobility of water molecules involved in the binding reaction at the interface between the lectin and the sugar molecules could account for enthalpy-entropy compensation. Displacement of water molecules from the interacting complementary surfaces account for the favorable entropic contribution. However, this gain in entropy from previously imposed motional restriction is offset by loss of a certain amount of enthalpic interactions, i.e. water-mediated hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions in the combining site. If a group of similar ligands interact by the same mechanism, then a linear relationship between enthalpy and entropy can be expected, with a slope of unity reflecting a complete compensation. Our ΔH versus TΔS plots show linearity with slope of 1.2 (correlation coefficient = 0.93) indicating an underlying common mechanism in artocarpin-sugar reaction, unlike ConA1 where profound deviations have been noted, for example, between the other sugars used in these studies and GlcNAc2Man3 (16Mandal D.K. Kishore N. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1149-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar, 17Mandal D.K. Bhattacharyya L. Koenig S.H. Brown R.D. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1157-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A value of >1 for the slope ( = 1.2) of enthalpy-entropy compensation plot indicates the primacy of enthalpic forces in determining the overall free energies of artocarpin-ligand interactions. This indicates that the major driving force for artocarpin-sugar interactions is hydrogen bonding and Van der Waals interactions. Additionally, temperature independence of enthalpies highlights that these reactions for the most part occur with little changes in the conformation of either the ligand or the protein. A comparison of the thermodynamic parameters for the binding of artocarpin with carbohydrates provide interesting insights on the topography of the combining site of artocarpin. As the artocarpin-sugar interactions are enthalpically driven and enthalpy-entropy compensation is observed, the differences in binding enthalpies can be explained by considering that the initial interaction of the carbohydrate ligands with the solvent is similar for all the ligands. The fact that glucose is about 9-fold poorer a ligand, as compared with mannose, and displays ΔHb, which is 9 kJ mol−1 less positive than the latter, emphasizes the importance of an axial orientation for the hydroxyl group at C2 of a hexapyranose for its interaction with the corresponding locus on the combining site of artocarpin. The preference of the lectin for mannopyranoside is also reflected when one considers the binding of MeαMan and MeαGlc, where the former is 6-fold better a ligand and exhibits 7.7 kJ mol−1 more favorable binding enthalpy as compared with the latter. The preference for mannopyranoside over glucopyranoside is apparently the highest for artocarpin as compared with the other mannose/glucose-specific lectins such as those from pea, lentil, ConA, or Diocleinae family of lectins (18Goldstein I.J. Poretz R.D. Goldstein I.J. Liener I.E. Sharon N. The Lectins. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986: 233-247Google Scholar, 19Schwarz F.P. Misquith S. Surolia A. Biochem.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12082-12088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). MeβMan was inactive, highlighting the indispensability of mannopyranoside in α configuration for its recognition by artocarpin. Nonbinding of N-acetylmannosamine suggests that the bulky acetamido group at C-2 in manno configuration leads to a steric hindrance. It is interesting to compare the binding potencies of various mannooligosaccharides with ConA, Dioclea lectins, and snowdrop lectin with that of artocarpin. Dioclea lectins and especially ConA recognize mannobioses in the order Manα1–2Man≫Manα1–6Man>Manα1–3Man in a site that essentially accommodates a monosaccharide, a fact also borne out by their nearly similar enthalpies of binding (21Mandal D.K. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5116-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22Chervenak M.C. Toone E.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5685-5695Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The greater affinity of ConA for Manα1–2Man has been related to statistically increased probability of binding of either the reducing or the nonreducing mannose residue to a site that essentially accommodates a single mannopyranosyl residue (21Mandal D.K. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5116-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 22Chervenak M.C. Toone E.J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5685-5695Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Dioclea lectins in most cases recognize these mannobioses by a similar mechanism (18Goldstein I.J. Poretz R.D. Goldstein I.J. Liener I.E. Sharon N. The Lectins. Academic Press, Orlando, FL1986: 233-247Google Scholar, 21Mandal D.K. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5116-5120Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). ConA and Dioclea lectins in general bind to the trimannoside, present in the core regions of N-linked glycans, with about 30–60- and 200-fold better affinities, respectively. It has also been demonstrated that, whereas the α1–6 mannose occupies the primary site viz. the high affinity monosaccharide binding site, the α1–3 linked mannose occupies a secondary site; and both together, with the reducing end 3,6-disubstituted core mannose residue, constitute the extended binding site discovered by the pioneering work of Brewer and co-workers (16Mandal D.K. Kishore N. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1149-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar,17Mandal D.K. Bhattacharyya L. Koenig S.H. Brown R.D. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F.

Snow drop (Galanthus nivalis agglutinin; GNA) lectin on the other hand binds preferentially to Manα1–3Man over Manα1–6Man and fails to recognize Manα1–2Man. Manα1–3Man is nearly equivalent in its affinity to that of mannotriose, and it has been proposed by Chevernak and Toone (27Chervenak M.C. Toone E.J. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 10533-10539Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar) that it has specific sites for binding to α1–6 and α1–3 arms of the trisaccharide (26Kaku H. Goldstein I.J. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 213: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Poor affinity of artocarpin for Manα1–2Man (Kb = 490 m−1) as compared with mannose (1378 m−1) itself together with its low enthalpy (−18.6 kJ mol−1 versus −25.1 kJ mol−1 of mannose) suggests that it is able to recognize only a part of mannose epitope in this disaccharide. It is therefore apparent that the substitution of the reducing end mannose at C-2, an essential locus for the recognition of artocarpin, precludes its binding, whereas the orientation of the reducing mannose in the disaccharide is such that some of its determinants are inaccessible to the combining site of the lectin (Fig.4). Manα1–3Man is ∼1.5–2-fold poorer a ligand, whereas Manα1–6Man is 17-fold weaker a ligand as compared with mannotriose. This indicates that α1–3-linked mannose occupies the primary binding site, and the α1–6Man occupies the secondary subsite with both sites being specific to the α1,3 and α1,6 arms of the two oligosaccharides. They, together with 3,6-disubstituted mannose residue, constitute the extended combining site of artocarpin. The equivalence of binding constants (∼9000–10,800 m−1) and ΔH(∼46–47 kJ mol−1) values for mannotriose and mannopentaose suggests that artocarpin binds to the trimannosyl moiety located at the α1,6 arm of mannopentaose. Poor binding of GlcNAc2Man3 (Kb = 2902m−1), a complex type glycan, and especially its low values of ΔH (10.94 kJ mol−1) underscore the unfavorable consequences of substituting the α1,3- and α1,6-linked mannosyl residues at their C-2 positions for interactions with artocarpin. In this respect, artocarpin differs strikingly from ConA where this structure binds better than mannotriose (17Mandal D.K. Bhattacharyya L. Koenig S.H. Brown R.D. Oscarson S. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1157-1162Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). More so, its binding mechanism also differs significantly from those of mannooligosaccharides, whereas for artocarpin its location on the enthalpy-entropy compensation plot attests to its mechanism of interaction akin to the other ligands used (16Mandal D.K. Kishore N. Brewer C.F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1149-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). At a superficial level, the combining site of artocarpin would appear similar to that of GNA. Nevertheless a detailed examination of thermodynamic parameters reveals that for GNA the binding of Manα1–3Man and mannotriose are accompanied by values of ΔH that differ very little from each other,i.e. 12.97 and 16.32 kJ mol−1, respectively (27Chervenak M.C. Toone E.J. J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 10533-10539Crossref Scopus (231) Google Scholar). For artocarpin the situation is different. The order of binding affinity is as follows: mannotriose>Manα3Man>GlcNAc2Man3>MeαMan>Man> Manα6Man>Manα2Man>MeαGlc>Glc,i.e. 7>4>2>1.4>1> 0.4>0.3>0.24>0.11. Moreover, the ΔHb values for the binding of MeαMan, Manα3Man, and Manα6Man are close to each other (27–29 kJ mol−1), which are about 20 kJ mol−1 lower than that of mannotriose. This indicates that, while the two disaccharides may be binding to artocarpin mostly through their nonreducing end monosaccharides to the respective subsites specific for α1–3 and α1–6 arms of the combining site, the addition of core mannose makes approximately −20 kJ mol−1 contribution to the binding enthalpy. In other words, in contrast to GNA where the core mannose makes little contribution, 3.2 kJ mol−1, to the overall binding process, in artocarpin it seems to make significant contribution to the interaction. Taken together, these data suggest that the extended binding site of artocarpin has features that diverge from both ConA family of lectins and GNA (16Mandal D.K. Kishore N. Brewer C.F.

A previous analysis of the membrane topology in Escherichia coli using the PhoA gene fusion technique indicated that only nine of these hydrophobic segments span the membrane, while three segments, Vb, VIII and IX, were predicted to have a periplasmic location (Van Geest, M., and Lolkema, J.

A topology study of C-terminally truncated CitS molecules in dog pancreas microsomes revealed that the protein traverses the endoplasmic reticulum membrane 11 times.

An engineered cysteine residue downstream of TMS VIII moved from a periplasmic to a cytoplasmic location when the fusion protein containing TMSs I–VIII was extended with segment IX.

In the ER, translocation and insertion proceed cotranslationally and are driven by the synthesis of the nascent chain on the ribosome. In Escherichia coli, translocation is post-translational and is driven by ATP hydrolysis catalyzed by the SecA subunit, a component not present in the eukaryotic system, and by the proton motive force across the membrane (8Andersson H. von Heijne G.

The resulting models showed remarkable similarities as well as remarkable differences. The amino acid sequence of CitS contains 12 hydrophobic segments that are long and hydrophobic enough to span the membrane in α-helical conformation, suggesting a membrane topology with 12 putative transmembrane segments (TMSs) (11van der Rest M.E. Siewe R.M. Abee T. Schwarz E. Oesterhelt D. Konings W.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8971-8976Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of a series of C-terminally deleted CitS molecules fused to the reporter molecule alkaline phosphatase (PhoA fusions) expressed in E. coliindicated that only nine of the 12 hydrophobic segments were transmembrane, while the three remaining segments, Vb, VIII, and IX, were in the periplasm (Fig. 1 A). The cytoplasmic and periplasmic localization of the NH2 and COOH terminus, respectively, was confirmed by tagging of the termini of CitS with the biotin acceptor domain of the oxaloacetate decarboxylase of K. pneumoniae (12van Geest M. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25582-25589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The same series of C-terminally truncated CitS molecules was expressed in ER microsomes, using leader peptidase as the insertion vehicle and the leader peptidase P2 domain as the topological reporter (13van Geest M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2816-2823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Similar to the bacterial studies, it was found that segment Vb was not transmembrane but was translocated to the lumen. However, in contrast to what was observed in the bacterial system, segments VIII and IX were found to be transmembrane, resulting in a membrane topology with 11 TMS in the ER membrane (Fig. 1 B). The difference in the two models arises from fusion constructs with the reporter fused to sites in between hydrophobic segments VIII and IX. In the microsomes, the reporter remained in the cytoplasm, while inE. coli the reporter was located in the periplasm, even when the CitS moiety contained 23 residues of the positively charged, hydrophilic loop between the two segments.The two folding models obtained for CitS may be explained in either of two ways: (i) both models are correct, meaning that the bacterial and eukaryotic insertion machineries fold the same polypeptide in two different ways; or (ii) the folding of CitS in the two systems is the same, but not all truncated fragments have the same membrane topology as in the full-length protein. More concretely, the hybrid protein with the fusion site between segments VIII and IX would wrongly indicate the localization of the fusion site in the full-length protein either in the bacterial or microsomal system.In the present study, we used site-directed cysteine labeling to determine the localization of segments VIII and IX in the full-length CitS protein in the E. coli membrane. The results demonstrated that both segments are transmembrane, showing that the folding of the CitS molecule is the same in the ER and E. coli membrane. It is concluded that CitS fragments of the fusion proteins with fusion sites between segment VIII and IX do not fold correctly in the E. coli membrane in the absence of the downstream CitS sequences. To understand the misfolding of the CitS fragment, we subsequently studied the folding of a number of CitS-PhoA fusion proteins by examining the accessibility of native and introduced cysteine residues in the CitS moiety. It followed that segment VIII has a periplasmic location in the truncated CitS molecule lacking the three C-terminal transmembrane segments, while the addition of downstream TMS IX was found to be both essential and sufficient for insertion of TMS VIII in the E. coli membrane. The accessibility of the Cys residues in the different truncated CitS fragments showed the interaction between successive transmembrane and loop domains as the protein is inserted into the membrane. The results are discussed in the context of the insertion mechanism of CitS in the E. colimembrane.DISCUSSIONThe hydropathy profile of the amino acid sequence of CitS reveals 12 stretches of amino acids that are hydrophobic and long enough to span the membrane (13van Geest M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2816-2823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A study in E. coli with C-terminally truncated CitS molecules fused in front of the mature part of alkaline phosphatase (PhoA fusions) indicated a membrane topology model with nine membrane-spanning segments with the remaining three hydrophobic segments (Vb, VIII, and IX) in the periplasm (Fig. 1 B) (12van Geest M. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25582-25589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A topology study in the ER membrane using the same truncated CitS molecules confirmed the exclusion of segment Vb from the membrane, but in contrast to the E. coli results, segments VIII and IX were found to be membrane-spanning. In the present study, the apparent contradiction between both models was resolved by examining the topology of segments VIII and IX in the E. coli membrane in the context of the complete and functional CitS molecule. Two cysteine residues introduced in the hydrophilic domain between segments VIII and IX were mapped in the cytoplasm by their accessibility to membrane-permeable and -impermeable thiol reagents. The results demonstrate that segments VIII and IX span the E. colimembrane in the full-length CitS molecule and, therefore, that the membrane topology of CitS is the same in the ER and E. colimembrane showing 11 TMS.The exclusion of segments VIII and IX from the membrane in the PhoA model was based upon a series of CitS-PhoA fusion proteins with the fusion sites at different positions in between segments VIII and IX. The fusion proteins all resulted in high alkaline phosphatase activity, demonstrating a periplasmic location of the PhoA molecule and suggesting a periplasmic location of transmembrane segment VIII in these fusion proteins (12van Geest M. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25582-25589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We studied the folding of the CitS moiety in several CitS-PhoA fusion proteins in order to obtain information about the insertion process of CitS in the E. coli membrane. A transmembrane disposition of segment VII in CitS-PhoA fusion proteins containing TMSs I–VII and I–VIII (SA290 and SA328, respectively) was consistent with the labeling characteristics of Cys278, located in the C-terminal half of TMS VII. In both fusion proteins, Cys278 reacted with the membrane-permeable sulhydryl reagent MBP and could not be blocked by the impermeable reagent AmdiS added at either side of the membrane, indicating that Cys278 in TMS VII was in the hydrophobic core of the membrane. Together with the periplasmic location of the introduced cysteine residue at position 315, downstream of TMS VIII (fusion protein SA328C315), it follows that the high PhoA activity of SA328 is indeed caused by misfolding of segment VIII. TMS VIII does not fold back across the membrane when the CitS molecule is truncated between segments VIII and IX. Remarkably, elongation of the CitS moiety in fusion protein SA328 with the next segment, TMS IX, moved the Cys315 residue from a periplasmic to a cytoplasmic location (Figs. 5 and 6). Apparently, the presence of TMS IX is both essential and sufficient for membrane insertion of TMS VIII. Together with the high alkaline phosphatase activity of fusion protein SA360, the results illustrate that in SA360 segments VIII and IX are both inserted into the membrane as they are in the full-length protein.Insertion of transmembrane segments that depend on the presence of neighboring segments has been reported in membrane topology studies of polytopic membrane proteins in the ER membrane (18Bayle D.

Remarkably, a study of the membrane topology of CitS in the ER membrane revealed that, in contrast to what was observed in the E. coli membrane, segment VIII was transmembrane in the absence of the downstream CitS sequences (13van Geest M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2816-2823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This difference suggests differences in the bacterial and ER insertion mechanisms or is related to different conditions during insertion, e.g. the presence or absence of a membrane potential, differences in experimental system (e.g. in vivo versus in vitro), or differences in the reporter system (e.g.alkaline phosphatase versus the P2 domain of leader peptidase).The process of membrane protein insertion into the E. colimembrane is still poorly understood. Evidence is increasing that insertion of integral membrane proteins in the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria proceeds via the preprotein translocation machinery, the Sec system, in a similar, but not identical, manner as observed in the ER membrane, which is much better understood (4Ulbrandt N.D. Newitt J.A. Bernstein H.D. Cell. 1997; 88: 187-196Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar, 5Seluanov A. Bibi E. J. Biol.

A. 1998; 95: 14646-14651Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). It may be anticipated that also in bacteria the insertion and ultimate folding of the protein is determined both by topological signals in the native chain and by the insertion machinery (23Do H. Falcone D. Lin J. Andrews D.W. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 369-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 24Mothes W. Heinrich S.U. Graf R. Nilsson I. von Heijne G.

Cell. 1997; 90: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The unexpected folding of the truncated protein consisting of the first eight TMSs of CitS may be a manifestation of specific interactions between the nascent chain and the Sec system. CitS contains five TMSs with an ingoing orientation. PhoA fused to sites in the loops following these segments was retained in the cytoplasm in four fusion proteins, while only in the case of TMS VIII the reporter molecule was translocated to the periplasm. The fusion site in fusion protein SA328 is 23 residues downstream of TMS VIII, including one negatively and three positively charged residues that should anchor the loop firmly in the cytoplasm (26Boyd D. Beckwith J. Cell. 1990; 62: 1031-1033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 27Boyd D. Traxler B. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 553-556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, TMS VIII is one of the more hydrophobic transmembrane segments of CitS with an average hydrophobicity of 0.75 on the scale of Eisenberg (13van Geest M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2816-2823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar,28Eisenberg D. Schwarz E. Komaromy M. Wall R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 125-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). There does not seem to be much reason why TMS VIII in SA328 would not be transmembrane unless the insertion machinery “tells” it to wait for TMS IX. The high hydrophobicity of TMS VIII makes it difficult to see why TMS VIII would need TMS IX for insertion, and therefore, we suggest that, instead, TMS IX needs TMS VIII for insertion. TMS IX is the transmembrane segment with the lowest average hydrophobicity in CitS (0.55). The sequence of events would be that first TMS VIII would be translocated across the membrane followed by TMS IX, after which the hydrophobicity of segment VIII would drive, facilitated or spontaneously, the insertion of the VIII/IX helix pair from the periplasm into the membrane. TMS IX might trigger the insertion of the helical hairpin. The exported segments VIII and IX would represent a folding intermediate trapped in the SA328 fusion protein, where TMS VIII is unable to pull PhoA in the membrane or simply is not triggered to do so.The accessibility of the native Cys residues in the successive CitS-PhoA fusion proteins monitors the folding process of the CitS protein. Cys278 in TMS VII is accessible in the hydrophobic phase of the membrane after insertion of the first seven TMSs. This is still the case after TMS VIII is translocated to the periplasm, but insertion of the helical hairpin VIII/IX, triggered by the presence of TMS IX, results in protection of Cys278. In this situation, Cys347 in TMS IX is also not accessible. The data suggest that the face of TMS VII containing Cys278 is in contact with TMSs VIII or IX or both and that the side of TMS IX containing Cys347 is buried in the other helices. Insertion of the hairpin VIII/IX renders Cys317 in the loop between TMSs VIII and IX freely accessible in the cytoplasm. Only when the CitS protein is completed, the latter Cys residue becomes protected against labeling, suggesting an interaction between the cytoplasmic domain between TMSs VIII and IX and downstream CitS sequences, possibly the loop between TMSs X and XI. The remaining two Cys residues, Cys398 and Cys414, in the latter cytoplasmic loop are also inaccessible in the complete protein. In the endoplasmic reticulum (ER),1 insertion of integral membrane proteins into the membrane is mediated by the same machinery that is responsible for the translocation of preproteins to the lumen. Preprotein translocation and membrane protein insertion are inherent functions of the Sec machinery (1Gorlich D. Rapoport T.A.

We have analyzed the membrane topology of the Na+-dependent citrate transporter CitS ofKlebsiella pneumoniae upon insertion in both the ER membrane and the E. coli cytoplasmic membrane. The resulting models showed remarkable similarities as well as remarkable differences. The amino acid sequence of CitS contains 12 hydrophobic segments that are long and hydrophobic enough to span the membrane in α-helical conformation, suggesting a membrane topology with 12 putative transmembrane segments (TMSs) (11van der Rest M.E.

Analysis of a series of C-terminally deleted CitS molecules fused to the reporter molecule alkaline phosphatase (PhoA fusions) expressed in E. coliindicated that only nine of the 12 hydrophobic segments were transmembrane, while the three remaining segments, Vb, VIII, and IX, were in the periplasm (Fig. 1 A). The cytoplasmic and periplasmic localization of the NH2 and COOH terminus, respectively, was confirmed by tagging of the termini of CitS with the biotin acceptor domain of the oxaloacetate decarboxylase of K. pneumoniae (12van Geest M. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25582-25589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The same series of C-terminally truncated CitS molecules was expressed in ER microsomes, using leader peptidase as the insertion vehicle and the leader peptidase P2 domain as the topological reporter (13van Geest M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2816-2823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Similar to the bacterial studies, it was found that segment Vb was not transmembrane but was translocated to the lumen. However, in contrast to what was observed in the bacterial system, segments VIII and IX were found to be transmembrane, resulting in a membrane topology with 11 TMS in the ER membrane (Fig. 1 B). The difference in the two models arises from fusion constructs with the reporter fused to sites in between hydrophobic segments VIII and IX. In the microsomes, the reporter remained in the cytoplasm, while inE. coli the reporter was located in the periplasm, even when the CitS moiety contained 23 residues of the positively charged, hydrophilic loop between the two segments. The two folding models obtained for CitS may be explained in either of two ways: (i) both models are correct, meaning that the bacterial and eukaryotic insertion machineries fold the same polypeptide in two different ways; or (ii) the folding of CitS in the two systems is the same, but not all truncated fragments have the same membrane topology as in the full-length protein. More concretely, the hybrid protein with the fusion site between segments VIII and IX would wrongly indicate the localization of the fusion site in the full-length protein either in the bacterial or microsomal system. In the present study, we used site-directed cysteine labeling to determine the localization of segments VIII and IX in the full-length CitS protein in the E. coli membrane. The results demonstrated that both segments are transmembrane, showing that the folding of the CitS molecule is the same in the ER and E. coli membrane. It is concluded that CitS fragments of the fusion proteins with fusion sites between segment VIII and IX do not fold correctly in the E. coli membrane in the absence of the downstream CitS sequences. To understand the misfolding of the CitS fragment, we subsequently studied the folding of a number of CitS-PhoA fusion proteins by examining the accessibility of native and introduced cysteine residues in the CitS moiety. It followed that segment VIII has a periplasmic location in the truncated CitS molecule lacking the three C-terminal transmembrane segments, while the addition of downstream TMS IX was found to be both essential and sufficient for insertion of TMS VIII in the E. coli membrane. The accessibility of the Cys residues in the different truncated CitS fragments showed the interaction between successive transmembrane and loop domains as the protein is inserted into the membrane. The results are discussed in the context of the insertion mechanism of CitS in the E. colimembrane. DISCUSSIONThe hydropathy profile of the amino acid sequence of CitS reveals 12 stretches of amino acids that are hydrophobic and long enough to span the membrane (13van Geest M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2816-2823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A study in E. coli with C-terminally truncated CitS molecules fused in front of the mature part of alkaline phosphatase (PhoA fusions) indicated a membrane topology model with nine membrane-spanning segments with the remaining three hydrophobic segments (Vb, VIII, and IX) in the periplasm (Fig. 1 B) (12van Geest M. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25582-25589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A topology study in the ER membrane using the same truncated CitS molecules confirmed the exclusion of segment Vb from the membrane, but in contrast to the E. coli results, segments VIII and IX were found to be membrane-spanning. In the present study, the apparent contradiction between both models was resolved by examining the topology of segments VIII and IX in the E. coli membrane in the context of the complete and functional CitS molecule. Two cysteine residues introduced in the hydrophilic domain between segments VIII and IX were mapped in the cytoplasm by their accessibility to membrane-permeable and -impermeable thiol reagents. The results demonstrate that segments VIII and IX span the E. colimembrane in the full-length CitS molecule and, therefore, that the membrane topology of CitS is the same in the ER and E. colimembrane showing 11 TMS.The exclusion of segments VIII and IX from the membrane in the PhoA model was based upon a series of CitS-PhoA fusion proteins with the fusion sites at different positions in between segments VIII and IX. The fusion proteins all resulted in high alkaline phosphatase activity, demonstrating a periplasmic location of the PhoA molecule and suggesting a periplasmic location of transmembrane segment VIII in these fusion proteins (12van Geest M. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25582-25589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We studied the folding of the CitS moiety in several CitS-PhoA fusion proteins in order to obtain information about the insertion process of CitS in the E. coli membrane. A transmembrane disposition of segment VII in CitS-PhoA fusion proteins containing TMSs I–VII and I–VIII (SA290 and SA328, respectively) was consistent with the labeling characteristics of Cys278, located in the C-terminal half of TMS VII. In both fusion proteins, Cys278 reacted with the membrane-permeable sulhydryl reagent MBP and could not be blocked by the impermeable reagent AmdiS added at either side of the membrane, indicating that Cys278 in TMS VII was in the hydrophobic core of the membrane. Together with the periplasmic location of the introduced cysteine residue at position 315, downstream of TMS VIII (fusion protein SA328C315), it follows that the high PhoA activity of SA328 is indeed caused by misfolding of segment VIII. TMS VIII does not fold back across the membrane when the CitS molecule is truncated between segments VIII and IX. Remarkably, elongation of the CitS moiety in fusion protein SA328 with the next segment, TMS IX, moved the Cys315 residue from a periplasmic to a cytoplasmic location (Figs. 5 and 6). Apparently, the presence of TMS IX is both essential and sufficient for membrane insertion of TMS VIII. Together with the high alkaline phosphatase activity of fusion protein SA360, the results illustrate that in SA360 segments VIII and IX are both inserted into the membrane as they are in the full-length protein.Insertion of transmembrane segments that depend on the presence of neighboring segments has been reported in membrane topology studies of polytopic membrane proteins in the ER membrane (18Bayle D.

Remarkably, a study of the membrane topology of CitS in the ER membrane revealed that, in contrast to what was observed in the E. coli membrane, segment VIII was transmembrane in the absence of the downstream CitS sequences (13van Geest M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2816-2823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This difference suggests differences in the bacterial and ER insertion mechanisms or is related to different conditions during insertion, e.g. the presence or absence of a membrane potential, differences in experimental system (e.g. in vivo versus in vitro), or differences in the reporter system (e.g.alkaline phosphatase versus the P2 domain of leader peptidase).The process of membrane protein insertion into the E. colimembrane is still poorly understood. Evidence is increasing that insertion of integral membrane proteins in the cytoplasmic membrane of bacteria proceeds via the preprotein translocation machinery, the Sec system, in a similar, but not identical, manner as observed in the ER membrane, which is much better understood (4Ulbrandt N.D.

It may be anticipated that also in bacteria the insertion and ultimate folding of the protein is determined both by topological signals in the native chain and by the insertion machinery (23Do H. Falcone D. Lin J. Andrews D.W. Johnson A.E. Cell. 1996; 85: 369-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar, 24Mothes W. Heinrich S.U. Graf R. Nilsson I. von Heijne G.

Cell. 1997; 90: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). The unexpected folding of the truncated protein consisting of the first eight TMSs of CitS may be a manifestation of specific interactions between the nascent chain and the Sec system. CitS contains five TMSs with an ingoing orientation. PhoA fused to sites in the loops following these segments was retained in the cytoplasm in four fusion proteins, while only in the case of TMS VIII the reporter molecule was translocated to the periplasm. The fusion site in fusion protein SA328 is 23 residues downstream of TMS VIII, including one negatively and three positively charged residues that should anchor the loop firmly in the cytoplasm (26Boyd D. Beckwith J. Cell. 1990; 62: 1031-1033Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 27Boyd D. Traxler B. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 553-556Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, TMS VIII is one of the more hydrophobic transmembrane segments of CitS with an average hydrophobicity of 0.75 on the scale of Eisenberg (13van Geest M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G. Lolkema J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 2816-2823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar,28Eisenberg D. Schwarz E. Komaromy M. Wall R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 125-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1683) Google Scholar). There does not seem to be much reason why TMS VIII in SA328 would not be transmembrane unless the insertion machinery “tells” it to wait for TMS IX. The high hydrophobicity of TMS VIII makes it difficult to see why TMS VIII would need TMS IX for insertion, and therefore, we suggest that, instead, TMS IX needs TMS VIII for insertion. TMS IX is the transmembrane segment with the lowest average hydrophobicity in CitS (0.55). The sequence of events would be that first TMS VIII would be translocated across the membrane followed by TMS IX, after which the hydrophobicity of segment VIII would drive, facilitated or spontaneously, the insertion of the VIII/IX helix pair from the periplasm into the membrane. TMS IX might trigger the insertion of the helical hairpin. The exported segments VIII and IX would represent a folding intermediate trapped in the SA328 fusion protein, where TMS VIII is unable to pull PhoA in the membrane or simply is not triggered to do so.The accessibility of the native Cys residues in the successive CitS-PhoA fusion proteins monitors the folding process of the CitS protein. Cys278 in TMS VII is accessible in the hydrophobic phase of the membrane after insertion of the first seven TMSs. This is still the case after TMS VIII is translocated to the periplasm, but insertion of the helical hairpin VIII/IX, triggered by the presence of TMS IX, results in protection of Cys278. In this situation, Cys347 in TMS IX is also not accessible. The data suggest that the face of TMS VII containing Cys278 is in contact with TMSs VIII or IX or both and that the side of TMS IX containing Cys347 is buried in the other helices. Insertion of the hairpin VIII/IX renders Cys317 in the loop between TMSs VIII and IX freely accessible in the cytoplasm. Only when the CitS protein is completed, the latter Cys residue becomes protected against labeling, suggesting an interaction between the cytoplasmic domain between TMSs VIII and IX and downstream CitS sequences, possibly the loop between TMSs X and XI. The remaining two Cys residues, Cys398 and Cys414, in the latter cytoplasmic loop are also inaccessible in the complete protein. The hydropathy profile of the amino acid sequence of CitS reveals 12 stretches of amino acids that are hydrophobic and long enough to span the membrane (13van Geest M. Nilsson I. von Heijne G.
