https://openalex.org/W2011612823,"Background MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are critical regulators of transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing, which are involved in multiple developmental processes in many organisms. Apart from miRNAs, mouse germ cells express another type of small RNA, piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs). Although it has been clear that piRNAs play a role in repression of retrotransposons during spermatogenesis, the function of miRNA in mouse germ cells has been unclear. Methodology/Principal Findings In this study, we first revealed the expression pattern of miRNAs by using a real-time PCR-based 220-plex miRNA expression profiling method. During development of germ cells, miR-17-92 cluster, which is thought to promote cell cycling, and the ES cell-specific cluster encoding miR-290 to -295 (miR-290-295 cluster) were highly expressed in primordial germ cells (PGCs) and spermatogonia. A set of miRNAs was developmentally regulated. We next analysed function of miRNA biogenesis in germ cell development by using conditional Dicer-knockout mice in which Dicer gene was deleted specifically in the germ cells. Dicer-deleted PGCs and spermatogonia exhibited poor proliferation. Retrotransposon activity was unexpectedly suppressed in Dicer-deleted PGCs, but not affected in the spermatogonia. In Dicer-deleted testis, spermatogenesis was retarded at an early stage when proliferation and/or early differentiation. Additionally, we analysed spermatogenesis in conditional Argonaute2-deficient mice. In contrast to Dicer-deficient testis, spermatogenesis in Argonaute2-deficient testis was indistinguishable from that in wild type. Conclusion/Significance These results illustrate that miRNAs are important for the proliferation of PGCs and spermatogonia, but dispensable for the repression of retrotransposons in developing germ cells. Consistently, miRNAs promoting cell cycling are highly expressed in PGCs and spermatogonia. Furthermore, based on normal spermatogenesis in Argonaute2-deficient testis, the critical function of Dicer in spermatogenesis is independent of Argonaute2."

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) were recently found to regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional/translational levels. The expression profiles of 157 miRNAs were examined in 19 HCC patients, and 19 up-regulated and 3 down-regulated miRNAs were found to be associated with HCC. Putative gene targets of these 22 miRNAs were predicted in silico and were significantly enriched in 34 biological pathways, most of which are frequently dysregulated during carcinogenesis. Further characterization of microRNA-224 (miR-224), the most significantly up-regulated miRNA in HCC patients, revealed that miR-224 increases apoptotic cell death as well as proliferation and targets apoptosis inhibitor-5 (API-5) to inhibit API-5 transcript expression. Significantly, miR-224 expression was found to be inversely correlated with API-5 expression in HCC patients (p"
https://openalex.org/W2031921215,"Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is the leading genetic cause of obesity. After initial severe hypotonia, PWS children become hyperphagic and morbidly obese, if intake is not restricted. Short stature with abnormal growth hormone secretion, hypogonadism, cognitive impairment, anxiety and behavior problems are other features. PWS is caused by lack of expression of imprinted genes in a ∼4 mb region of chromosome band 15q11.2. Our previous translocation studies predicted a major role for the C/D box small nucleolar RNA cluster SNORD116 (PWCR1/HBII-85) in PWS. To test this hypothesis, we created a ∼150 kb deletion of the >40 copies of Snord116 (Pwcr1/MBII-85) in C57BL/6 mice. Snord116del mice with paternally derived deletion lack expression of this snoRNA. They have early-onset postnatal growth deficiency, but normal fertility and lifespan. While pituitary structure and somatotrophs are normal, liver Igf1 mRNA is decreased. In cognitive and behavior tests, Snord116del mice are deficient in motor learning and have increased anxiety. Around three months of age, they develop hyperphagia, but stay lean on regular and high-fat diet. On reduced caloric intake, Snord116del mice maintain their weight better than wild-type littermates, excluding increased energy requirement as a cause of hyperphagia. Normal compensatory feeding after fasting, and ability to maintain body temperature in the cold indicate normal energy homeostasis regulation. Metabolic chamber studies reveal that Snord116del mice maintain energy homeostasis by altered fuel usage. Prolonged mealtime and increased circulating ghrelin indicate a defect in meal termination mechanism. Snord116del mice, the first snoRNA deletion animal model, reveal a novel role for a non-coding RNA in growth and feeding regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2065667074,"Sir2, a NAD-dependent deacetylase, modulates lifespan in yeasts, worms and flies. The SIRT1, mammalian homologue of Sir2, regulates signaling for favoring survival in stress. But whether SIRT1 has the function to influence cell viability and senescence under non-stressed conditions in human diploid fibroblasts is far from unknown. Our data showed that enforced SIRT1 expression promoted cell proliferation and antagonized cellular senescence with the characteristic features of delayed Senescence-Associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining, reduced Senescence-Associated Heterochromatic Foci (SAHF) formation and G1 phase arrest, increased cell growth rate and extended cellular lifespan in human fibroblasts, while dominant-negative SIRT1 allele (H363Y) did not significantly affect cell growth and senescence but displayed a bit decreased lifespan.. Western blot results showed that SIRT1 reduced the expression of p16INK4A and promoted phosphorylation of Rb. Our data also exposed that overexpression of SIRT1 was accompanied by enhanced activation of ERK and S6K1 signaling. These effects were mimicked in both WI38 cells and 2BS cells by concentration-dependent resveratrol, a SIRT1 activator. It was noted that treatment of SIRT1-.transfected cells with Rapamycin, a mTOR inhibitor, reduced the phosphorylation of S6K1 and the expression of Id1, implying that SIRT1-induced phosphorylation of S6K1 may be partly for the decreased expression of p16INK4A and promoted phosphorylation of Rb in 2BS. It was also observed that the expression of SIRT1 and phosphorylation of ERK and S6K1 was declined in senescent 2BS. These findings suggested that SIRT1-promoted cell proliferation and antagonized cellular senescence in human diploid fibroblasts may be, in part, via the activation of ERK/ S6K1 signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2073770292,"The cellular response to the introduction of double strand DNA breaks involves complexes of protein interactions that govern cell cycle checkpoint arrest and repair of the DNA lesions. The checkpoint kinases Chk1 and Chk2 phosphorylate the carboxy-terminal domain of hBRCA2, a protein involved in recombination-mediated DNA repair (HRR) and replication fork maintenance. Cells deficient in hBRCA2 are hypersensitive to DNA damaging agents. Phosphorylation of the residue in hBRCA2 targeted by the Chk1 and Chk2 kinases regulates its interaction with Rad51. Furthermore, the cell line lex1/lex2, which lacks the carboxy-terminal domain containing the phosphorylated residue, does not support localization of Rad51 to nuclear foci after exposure to UV or treatment with ionizing radiation (IR). The data show that either phosphorylation of Rad51 by Chk1 or phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal domain of hBRCA2 by Chk1 or Chk2 plays a critical role in the binding of Rad51 to hBRCA2 and the subsequent recruitment of Rad51 to sites of DNA damage. While depletion of Chk1 from cells leads to loss of Rad51 localization to nuclear foci in response to replication arrest, cells lacking Chk2 also show a defect in Rad51 localization, but only in presence of double strand DNA breaks, indicating that each of these kinases may contribute somewhat differently to the formation of Rad51 nucleoprotein filaments depending on the type of DNA damage incurred by the cells."
https://openalex.org/W2071046105,"Time, space and numbers are closely linked in the physical world. However, the relativistic-like effects on time perception of spatial and magnitude factors remain poorly investigated. Here we wanted to investigate whether duration judgments of digit visual stimuli are biased depending on the side of space where the stimuli are presented and on the magnitude of the stimulus itself. Different groups of healthy subjects performed duration judgment tasks on various types of visual stimuli. In the first two experiments visual stimuli were constituted by digit pairs (1 and 9), presented in the centre of the screen or in the right and left space. In a third experiment visual stimuli were constituted by black circles. The duration of the reference stimulus was fixed at 300 ms. Subjects had to indicate the relative duration of the test stimulus compared with the reference one. The main results showed that, regardless of digit magnitude, duration of stimuli presented in the left hemispace is underestimated and that of stimuli presented in the right hemispace is overestimated. On the other hand, in midline position, duration judgments are affected by the numerical magnitude of the presented stimulus, with time underestimation of stimuli of low magnitude and time overestimation of stimuli of high magnitude. These results argue for the presence of strict interactions between space, time and magnitude representation on the human brain."
https://openalex.org/W2125132932,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) guide posttranscriptional repression of mRNAs. Hundreds of miRNAs have been identified but the target identification of mammalian mRNAs is still a difficult task due to a poor understanding of the interaction between miRNAs and the miRNA recognizing element (MRE). In recent research, the importance of the 5′ end of the miRNA:MRE duplex has been emphasized and the effect of the tail region addressed, but the role of the central loop has largely remained unexplored. Here we examined the effect of the loop region in miRNA:MRE duplexes and found that the location of the central loop is one of the important factors affecting the efficiency of gene regulation mediated by miRNAs. It was further determined that the addition of a loop score combining both location and size as a new criterion for predicting MREs and their cognate miRNAs significantly decreased the false positive rates and increased the specificity of MRE prediction."
https://openalex.org/W2031918634,"Chromatin endowed by histone modifications governs chromatin structure, which in turn represents a means to regulate cellular processes, including transcription and heterochromatin formation. Recent evidence revealed a plethora of enzymes that catalyze specific histone modifications for epigenetic maintenance, and dysregulation of which contributes to tumorigenesis and developmental defects. The histone methyltransferase SET8 (also known as Pr-Set7) was previously reported to monomethylate Lys(20) of histone H4. However, the temporal and spatial control of SET8 activity remains elusive. Here, we provide evidence to support that SET8 monomethylates Lys(20) of histone H4 during S phase by tethering to proliferating cell nuclear antigen via a putative proliferating cell nuclear antigen-interacting protein box. In addition, we show that SET8 function is required for S phase progression. Finally, deletion of SET8 in mice causes embryonic lethality, suggesting that SET8 plays an important role in mammalian embryogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2114331359,"Background Lung cancer causes approximately 1.2 million deaths per year worldwide, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents 85% of all lung cancers. Understanding the molecular events in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is essential to improve early diagnosis and treatment for this disease. Methodology and Principal Findings In an attempt to identify novel NSCLC related genes, we performed a genome-wide screening of chromosomal copy number changes affecting gene expression using microarray based comparative genomic hybridization and gene expression arrays on 32 radically resected tumor samples from stage I and II NSCLC patients. An integrative analysis tool was applied to determine whether chromosomal copy number affects gene expression. We identified a deletion on 14q32.2-33 as a common alteration in NSCLC (44%), which significantly influenced gene expression for HSP90, residing on 14q32. This deletion was correlated with better overall survival (P = 0.008), survival was also longer in patients whose tumors had low expression levels of HSP90. We extended the analysis to three independent validation sets of NSCLC patients, and confirmed low HSP90 expression to be related with longer overall survival (P = 0.003, P = 0.07 and P = 0.04). Furthermore, in vitro treatment with an HSP90 inhibitor had potent antiproliferative activity in NSCLC cell lines. Conclusions We suggest that targeting HSP90 will have clinical impact for NSCLC patients."
https://openalex.org/W2030978808,"Monitoring the effectiveness of global antiretroviral therapy scale-up efforts in resource-limited settings is a global health priority, but is complicated by high rates of losses to follow-up after treatment initiation. Determining definitive outcomes of these lost patients, and the effects of losses to follow-up on estimates of survival and risk factors for death after HAART, are key to monitoring the effectiveness of global HAART scale-up efforts.A cohort study comparing clinical outcomes and risk factors for death after HAART initiation as reported before and after tracing of patients lost to follow-up was conducted in Botswana's National Antiretroviral Therapy Program. 410 HIV-infected adults consecutively presenting for HAART were evaluated. The main outcome measures were death or loss to follow-up within the first year after HAART initiation. Of 68 patients initially categorized as lost, over half (58.8%) were confirmed dead after tracing. Patient tracing resulted in reporting of significantly lower survival rates when death was used as the outcome and losses to follow-up were censored [1-year Kaplan Meier survival estimate 0.92 (95% confidence interval, 0.88-0.94 before tracing and 0.83 (95% confidence interval, 0.79-0.86) after tracing, log rank P<0.001]. In addition, a significantly increased risk of death after HAART among men [adjusted hazard ratio 1.74 (95% confidence interval, 1.05-2.87)] would have been missed had patients not been traced [adjusted hazard ratio 1.41 (95% confidence interval, 0.65-3.05)].Due to high rates of death among patients lost to follow-up after HAART, survival rates may be inaccurate and important risk factors for death may be missed if patients are not actively traced. Patient tracing and uniform reporting of outcomes after HAART are needed to enable accurate monitoring of global HAART scale-up efforts."
https://openalex.org/W2093342110,"Recent studies demonstrate that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression is frequently associated with lymph node metastasis. However, the mechanism by which COX-2 increases the invasion of cancer cells to lymph node is unclear. CCR7 is a chemokine receptor that plays important roles in the mediation of migration of leukocytes and dendritic cells toward lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) that express receptor ligand CCL21. We found that treatment of prostaglandin E2 or ectopic expression of COX-2 in MCF-7 cells up-regulated CCR7 expression. On the contrary, knockdown of COX-2 by small hairpin RNA reduced CCR7 in COX-2-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells. Interaction of CCR7 and CCL21 was important for the migration of breast cancer cells toward LECs because antibodies against these two molecules inhibited the migration. We also found that COX-2 increased CCR7 expression via the EP2 and EP4 receptor in breast cancer cells. EP2 and EP4 agonists stimulated CCR7 in MCF-7 cells, whereas antagonists or small hairpin RNA of EP2 and EP4 attenuated CCR7 in MDA-MB-231 cells. Protein kinase A and AKT kinase were involved in COX-2-induced CCR7. Pathological analysis demonstrated that COX-2 overexpression was associated with CCR7, EP2, and EP4 expressions in breast tumor tissues. In addition, CCR7 expression in COX-2-overexpressing tumors was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis. Collectively, we suggest that CCR7 is a down-stream target for COX-2 to enhance the migration of breast cancer cells toward LECs and to promote lymphatic invasion.

Cyclooxygenases (COXs) 2The abbreviations used are: COX, cyclooxygenase; LECs, lymphatic endothelial cells; PG, prostaglandin; shRNA, small hairpin RNA; PKA, protein kinase A; VEGF-C, vascular growth factor C; VEGFR3, vascular growth factor receptor 3; RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. 2The abbreviations used are: COX, cyclooxygenase; LECs, lymphatic endothelial cells; PG, prostaglandin; shRNA, small hairpin RNA; PKA, protein kinase A; VEGF-C, vascular growth factor C; VEGFR3, vascular growth factor receptor 3; RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. are the rate-limiting enzymes that catalyze the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins (PGs). Two COX isoforms with distinct tissue distributions and physiological functions have been identified (1Smith W.L. DeWitt D.L. Garavito R.M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 145-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2394) Google Scholar, 2Warner T.D. Mitchell J.A. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 790-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) is constitutively expressed in many tissues and plays important roles in the control of homeostasis (3Morita I. Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat. 2002; 68–69: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Conversely, COX-2 is an inducible enzyme and is activated by extracellular stimuli such as growth factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines (4Turini M.E. DuBois R.N. Annu. Rev. Med. 2002; 53: 35-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Recent investigations indicated that overexpression of COX-2 is frequently found in many types of cancer, including colon, lung, breast, pancreas, and head and neck cancers (5Sano H. Kawahito Y.

Gastroenterology. 2003; 124: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The contribution of COX-2 to tumorigenesis has been intensively studied. Several mechanisms are considered to mediate the tumorigenic activity of COX-2. First, PGE2, the main metabolite of COX-2, is a growth promoter and may directly stimulate proliferation of cancer cells (13Pai R. Soreghan B. Szabo I.L. Pavelka M. Baatar D. Tarnawski A.S. Nat. Med. 2002; 8: 289-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (762) Google Scholar, 14Mutoh M. Watanabe K. Kitamura T. Shoji Y. Takahashi M. Kawamori T. Tani K. Kobayashi M. Maruyama T. Kobayashi K. Ohuchida S. Sugimoto Y. Narumiya S. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 28-32PubMed Google Scholar). Second, COX-2 is an angiogenic stimulator and may increase the production of angiogenic factors and migration of endothelial cells (15Tsujii M. Kawano S. Tsuji S. Sawaoka H. Hori M. DuBois R.N. Cell. 1998; 93: 705-716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2201) Google Scholar, 16Gately S. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 2000; 19: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Third, COX-2-derived PGE2 is an anti-apoptotic molecule that may prevent apoptosis induced by anti-cancer drugs (17Lin M.T. Lee R.C. Yang P.C. Ho F.M. Kuo M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48997-49002Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 18Sorokin A. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004; 10: 647-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 19Chang H.C. Weng C.F. Oncol. Rep. 2001; 8: 1321-1325PubMed Google Scholar). Fourth, PGE2 is an immunoregulatory molecule that may suppress the anti-tumor activity of natural killer cells and macrophages (20Huang M. Sharma S. Mao J.T. Dubinett S.M. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5512-5520PubMed Google Scholar). Fifth, COX-2 expression may increase the invasive ability of tumor cells and is closely linked with lymph node metastasis (21Costa C. Soares R. Reis-Filho J.S. Leitao D. Amendoeira I. Schmitt F.C. J. Clin. Pathol. 2002; 55: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 22Denkert C. Winzer K.J. Muller B.M. Weichert W. Pest S. Kobel M. Kristiansen G. Reles A. Siegert A. Guski H. Hauptmann S. Cancer. 2003; 97: 2978-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Results of xenograft animal studies also indicated that inhibition of COX-2 decreased tumor growth and lymph node metastasis (23Barnes N.L. Warnberg F. Farnie G. White D. Jiang W. Anderson E. Bundred N.J. Br. J. Cancer. 2007; 96: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Whereas the functional role of COX-2 in the promotion of tumor angiogenesis is well documented, the mechanism by which COX-2 enhances lymphangiogenesis and lymph node metastasis remains unknown. A possible mediator that participates in the COX-2-induced lymphangiogenesis is vascular endothelial growth factor-C (VEGF-C). Ectopic expression of COX-2 in breast and lung cancer cells up-regulates VEGF-C, which may stimulate VEGF receptor 3 (VEGFR3) on the surface of LECs to promote lymphangiogenesis (24Su J.L. Shih J.Y. Yen M.L. Jeng Y.M. Chang C.C. Hsieh C.Y. Wei L.H. Yang P.C. Kuo M.L. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 25Timoshenko A.V. Chakraborty C. Wagner G.F. Lala P.K. Br. J. Cancer. 2006; 94: 1154-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The interaction between chemokines and their cognate receptors is critical in tumor metastasis. Recent evidence demonstrates that the chemokine receptor CXCR4 and its ligand stroma-derived factor-1 are key regulators for the dissemination of cancer cells (26Muller A. Homey B. Soto H. Ge N. Catron D. Buchanan M.E. McClanahan T. Murphy E. Yuan W. Wagner S.N. Barrera J.L. Mohar A. Verastegui E. Zlotnik A. Nature. 2001; 410: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (4387) Google Scholar, 27Taichman R.S. Cooper C. Keller E.T. Pienta K.J. Taichman N.S. McCauley L.K. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 1832-1837PubMed Google Scholar). The chemokine receptor CCR7 is important for the adhesion and chemotaxis of leukocyte and dendritic cell toward lymph nodes. Since LECs express a high level of CCR7 ligands CCL19 and CCL21, up-regulation of CCR7 in cancer cells may promote the migration of cancer cells toward LECs and enhance lymph node invasion. In this study, we addressed the following objectives: (a) correlation of expression of COX-2 and CCR7 in breast cancer cell lines and tumor tissues, (b) whether COX-2 may up-regulate CCR7 expression in breast cancer cells and promote their migration toward LECs, and (c) the receptors and signaling pathways that mediate the induction of CCR7 by COX-2. Cell Culture and Experimental Agents—MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells were obtained from the cell bank of the National Health Research Institute (Miaoli, Taiwan). Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium containing 10% charcoal-stripped fetal calf serum (FCS) and antibiotics. Lymphatic endothelial cells were provided by Dr. Hsei-Wei Wang (National Yang-Ming University, Taipei). PGE1 alcohol (catalog number 13020), butaprost (catalog number 13740), sulprostone (catalog number 14765), and AH6809 (catalog number 14050) were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). AH23848 (catalog number A8227), dibutyryl cAMP (catalog number D0627), U0126 (catalog number U012), and KT5720 (catalog number K3761) were purchased from Sigma.

AKT (catalog number 9272), phospho-T308-AKT (catalog number 9275) and phospho-S473-AKT (catalog number 9271) antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling (Danvers, MA). Dominant-negative AKT expression vector was provided by Dr. Min-Liang Kuo (National Taiwan University, Taipei). The inducible expression vector MT-Rev, which expressed regulatory subunit of PKA, was provided by Dr. Stanley McKnight (University of Washington, Seattle). Antibody against the regulatory subunit of PKA was purchased from BD Biosciences. Tumor Tissues—Seventy nine paired normal and breast tumor tissues were obtained from patients who underwent resection of tumors at the Department of Surgery, Chung-Ho Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung Medical University. Detailed data about patient- and tumor-related variables were collected by reviewing the patients' medical charts. Before acquisition of these tissues, the investigational nature of this study was explained to patients, and informed consent was obtained. Portions of resected tissues were quickly placed into the RNAlater solution (Ambion, Austin, TX) and were subjected for isolation of genomic DNA, total RNA, and proteins by using TRIzol reagent according to the procedures of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR and Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated and subjected to RT-PCR analysis as described previously (28Liu L.T. Chang H.C. Chiang L.C. Hung W.C. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3069-3072PubMed Google Scholar). The primer sequences were CCR7 forward, 5′-GGACCTGGGGAAACCAAT-3′, and CCR7 reverse, 5′-GCCAGGTTGAGCAGGTAGGT-3′; COX-2 forward, 5′-GTCCTTTCAAGGAGAATGGTGC-3′, and COX-2 reverse, 5′-GGTCTGGTGCCTGGTCTGATGATG-3′; EP2 forward, 5′-CAACCTCATCCGCATGCAC-3′, and EP2 reverse, 5′-CTCAAAGGTCAGCCTG-3′; EP4 forward, 5′-GGTCATCTTACTCATTGCCACC-3′, and EP-4 reverse, 5′-AGATGAAGGAGCGAGAGTGG-3′; CCL21 forward, 5′-ACCCAAGGCAGTGATGGA-3′, and CCL21 reverse, 5′-TTTGGAGCCCTTTCCTTTCT-3′; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) forward, 5′-GAGTCAACGGATTTGGTCGT-3′, and GAPDH reverse, 5′-TGTGGTCATGAGTCCTTCCA-3′. Amplified cDNA products were run on 2% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV light. The signal intensities of COX-2, CCR7, EP2, and EP4 were measured by a densitometer and normalized to GAPDH signal intensity. In some experiments, the mRNA level of CCR7 was quantified by real time RT-PCR using iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). GAPDH served as an internal control for total complementary DNA content. Samples were amplified by using the MJ Mini real time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad). The PCR primers for CCR7 were as follows: CCR7 forward, 5′-GGGGAAACCAATGAAAAGC-3′, and CCR7 reverse, 5′-ACCTCATCTTGACACAGGCATA-3′. Immunoblotting—Treated cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and harvested in a lysis buffer as described previously (28Liu L.T. Chang H.C. Chiang L.C. Hung W.C. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 3069-3072PubMed Google Scholar). Equal amounts of cellular proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10 or 12.5% gels. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and the blots were incubated with different primary antibodies. Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents were used to depict the protein bands on the membrane. Flow Cytometry—For detection of CCR7 protein expression on the cell surface, cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with biotinylated anti-CCR7 antibody at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing, cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated avidin and subjected to flow cytometric analysis as described previously (29Berahovich R.D. Lai N.L. Wei Z. Lanier L.L. Schall T.J. J. Immunol. 2006; 177: 7833-7840Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). shRNA Targeting—shRNAs carrying puromycin selection marker were purchased from the National RNAi Core Facility of Academic Sinica (Taiwan). The sequences used for targeting were as follows: COX-2, 5′-GCAGATGAAATACCAGTCTTT-3′; CCR7, 5′-CCCTTTCTTGTACGCCTTCAT-3′; EP4, 5′-ACCAGTTATATCAGCCAAGTT-3′; and EP2, 5′-GCCATGTATGAAGCCAAATAT-3′. Cells were transfected with the shRNA plasmids and selected by puromycin for 3 weeks. The expression of CCR7, EP2, EP4, and COX-2 was investigated, and the stable clones with the highest knockdown efficiency were used for study. In Vitro Invasion Assay—In vitro invasion assay was performed by using 24-well transwell units with polycarbonate filters (pore size 8 μm) coated on the upper side with Matrigel (Discovery Labware) (30Chang H.C. Cho C.Y. Hung W.C. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 8413-8420Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were collected, and 3 × 103 cells in 100 μl of medium with control immunoglobulin or anti-CCR7 antibody (5 μg/ml) were placed in the upper part of the transwell unit and allowed to invade for 24 h. The lower part of the transwell unit was filled with LEC-conditioned medium. In some experiments, LEC-conditioned medium was first incubated with anti-CCR21 (5 μg/ml) to neutralize CCL21 and then placed on the lower part for invasion study. After incubation, non-invaded cells on the upper part of the membrane were removed with a cotton swab. Invaded cells on the bottom surface of the membrane were fixed in formaldehyde, stained with Giemsa solution, and counted under a microscope. Invasive ability of stable transfectants of MDA-MB-231 cells expressing COX-2, CCR7, EP2, or EP4 shRNA was also investigated. Statistical Analysis—The associations between COX-2 and CCR7 with clinicopathological parameters were assessed using χ2 test and Fisher's exact test. The correlations between COX-2 expression with CCR7, EP2, and EP4 were examined by Spearman rank correlation. Paired t test was performed to test the association of COX-2 and CCR7 up-regulation in tumor tissues. Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for testing COX-2 and CCR7 levels of lymph node-negative tumors with lymph node-positive tumors. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Up-regulation of CCR7 by COX-2 in Breast Cancer Cell Lines—We first compared the expression of COX-2 and CCR7 in non-metastatic MCF-7 and highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. As demonstrated in Fig. 1A, RT-PCR analysis showed that CCR7 was highly expressed in COX-2-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells. Conversely, the expression of CCR7 was low in MCF-7 cells that expressed low levels of COX-2. To confirm the RT-PCR results, we performed flow cytometry to investigate the CCR7 protein level on the cell surface. A positive correlation between CCR7 mRNA and protein expression was seen in these two breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 1A). We next used different approaches to clarify whether COX-2 could regulate CCR7 expression in breast cancer cells. Since MCF-7 cells expressed low level of COX-2 and CCR7, we treated these cells with PGE2 and found that PGE2 increased CCR7 mRNA and protein expression in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 1B). Ectopic expression of COX-2 also increased CCR7 expression in these cells (Fig. 1C). MDA-MB-231 cells expressed high levels of COX-2; we used shRNA to knock down COX-2 expression, and our data showed that inhibition of COX-2 by shRNA induced down-regulation of CCR7 (Fig. 1D). Consistent with this result, a COX-2-specific inhibitor NS398 also reduced the expression of CCR7 in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 1E). By manipulating the expression of COX-2 in different breast cancer cell lines, we concluded that COX-2 and its metabolite PGE2 might stimulate CCR7 expression. CCR7 Expression Enhanced the Migration of Breast Cancer Cells toward LECs—We next addressed whether CCR7 is required for the migration of breast cancer cells toward LECs. Primary cultured LECs used in these assays expressed high levels of CCL21 (data not shown). Conditioned medium of LECs was placed on the lower part of a transwell unit, and breast cancer cells were added to the upper part in the absence or presence of anti-CCR7 antibody. As shown in Fig. 2A, the migration ability of MCF-7 was poor. Ectopic expression of COX-2 significantly enhanced the migration ability of MCF-7 cells that could be specifically blocked by the anti-CCR7 antibody. MDA-MB-231 cells were highly invasive, and the migration ability was also significantly attenuated by the anti-CCR7 antibody (Fig. 2B). Similar results were observed when a co-culture system was used by seeding the LECs on the lower part of the transwell unit (data not shown). This effect was not non-specifically caused by anti-CCR7 antibody because this antibody did not exhibit cytotoxic effect on breast cancer cells (supplemental Fig. 1). To verify the migration of breast cancer cells was induced by the interaction between CCR7 and CCL21, conditioned medium was pre-cleared by anti-CCL21 antibody and then used for the migration assay. As shown in Fig. 2C, we found that migration of MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells into a lower unit was significantly reduced. We also used shRNA to knock down COX-2 or CCR7 expression in these two cell lines and found that migration ability of the stable transfectants was attenuated (Fig. 2, D and E). In addition, the reduction was more significant in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 2D). Our data suggested that up-regulation of CCR7 by COX-2 in breast cancer cells enhanced their migration toward LECs. PGE2 and COX-2 Up-regulated CCR7 via EP2 and EP4 Receptor—Four types of G protein-coupled EP receptor have been identified in mammalian cells. Therefore, we addressed which type of receptor was involved in PGE2-induced increase of CCR7. RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 expressed all types of EP receptor (Fig. 3A). Both cell lines expressed similar levels of EP1 and EP3. Conversely, EP2 and EP4 were up-regulated in MDA-MB-231 cells. Since MCF-7 cells expressed very low levels of endogenous COX-2, we used ligand stimulation assay to study the specific receptors that mediated the induction of CCR7 by COX-2. Addition of PGE2, butaprost (EP2 agonist), or PGE1 alcohol (EP4 agonist) up-regulated CCR7 expression by 2–3-fold in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 3B). Conversely, the EP1/EP3 agonist sulprostone had little effect. We next performed antagonist inhibition assay to test whether EP2 and EP4 receptors were involved in the autocrine induction of CCR7 in COX-2-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells. Our data demonstrated that the EP2 antagonist AH6809 and the EP4 antagonist AH23848 suppressed CCR7 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 3C). To clarify the role of EP2 and EP4 more clearly, we used shRNA to knock down EP2 and EP4 expression. As shown in Fig. 3D, knockdown of EP2 and EP4 protein led to down-regulation of CCR7 mRNA and protein level in MDA-MB-231. In addition, the invasive ability of EP2 or EP4 knockdown cells was significantly reduced (Fig. 3E). These results strongly suggested that COX-2 up-regulated CCR7 via EP2 and EP4 receptor in breast cancer cells.FIGURE 3Mediation of COX-2-induced CCR7 expression by EP2 and EP4 receptor. A, total RNA was extracted from MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 (231), cells and RT-PCR was performed to examine the expression of EP1–4 receptors. B, MCF-7 cells were stimulated with vehicle (V, 0.1% DMSO), sulprostone (Sul, 10 μmol/liter), butaprost (But, 10 μmol/liter), PGE1 alcohol (E1, 1 μmol/liter), and PGE2 (E2, 100 nmol/liter) for 24 h, and CCR7 expression was studied by quantitative RT-PCR. ★, p < 0.05 when drug-treated group was compared with vehicle group.

Therefore, we investigated the functional role of PKA in COX-2-induced CCR7. Stimulation of MCF-7 cells by dibutyryl cAMP, a potent PKA activator, up-regulated CCR7 mRNA and protein expression (Fig. 4A). Forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase and PKA activator, also increased CCR7 expression in MCF-7 cells (supplemental Fig. 2). Pretreatment of a PKA inhibitor KT5720 potently suppressed dibutyryl cAMP-induced CCR7 (Fig. 4B). Similarly, KT5720 also attenuated CCR7 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 4C). To address the functional role of PKA more specifically, we ectopically expressed the regulatory subunit of PKA to inhibit its activity in MDA-MB-231 cells and found that it caused a decrease of CCR7 expression (supplemental Fig. 3). Moreover, the increase of PKA regulatory subunit in MCF-7 cells also reduced butaprost (EP2 agonist)-induced and PGE1 alcohol (EP4 agonist)-induced CCR7 expression (supplemental Fig. 4). EP4 receptor has been found to activate ERK via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (31Fujino H. Xu W. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12151-12156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). However, treatment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and ERK inhibitor (LY294002 and U0126) did not affect CCR7 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 4D). A recent study demonstrated that stimulation of the EP2 receptor induced PKA-dependent and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-independent activation of AKT (31Fujino H. Xu W. Regan J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12151-12156Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In addition, PKA phosphorylated Thr-308 but not Ser-473 (two major activating phosphorylation sites) on AKT (32Filippa N. Sable C.L. Filloux C. Hemmings B. van Obberghen E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4989-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied whether AKT was involved in the induction of CCR7 by COX-2. Fig. 5A showed that PGE2 and dibutyryl cAMP increased the phosphorylation of Thr-308 of AKT in MCF-7 cells. Pretreatment of PKA inhibitor KT5720 totally abolished this effect. Our data also showed that PGE2-increased CCR7 expression in MCF-7 cells was attenuated by dominant-negative AKT (Fig. 5B). In addition, dominant-negative AKT also reduced CCR7 expression in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 5C). PKA inhibitor KT5720 reduced Thr-308 but not Ser-473 phosphorylation of AKT in MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 5D). More importantly, EP2 and EP4 receptor antagonists AH23848 and AH6809 also inhibited Thr-308 phosphorylation. These data suggested that COX-2 induced CCR7 expression via a PKA/AKT-dependent pathway.FIGURE 5PKA-induced AKT activation involved in the induction of CCR7 by COX-2. A, MCF-7 cells were treated with vehicle (V, 0.1% DMSO), PGE2 (100 nmol/liter), or dibutyryl cAMP (100 μmol/liter) for 30 min, and the amount of T308-AKT and S473-AKT was assessed by phospho-specific antibodies, and the amount of AKT was used as internal control. Lower panel, cells were pretreated with KT5720 for 1 h and then stimulated with PGE2 or dibutyryl cAMP. The phosphorylation status of Thr-308 was studied. B, MCF-7 cells were transfected with control (C) or dominant-negative AKT (DN-AKT) expression vector for 48 h. Cells were then treated with vehicle (V) or PGE2 for another 24 h. CCR7 expression was assessed by flow cytometry. C, MDA-MB-231 cells were transfected with control (C) or dominant-negative AKT (DN-AKT) expression vector for 48 h, and CCR7 expression was determined by flow cytometry. D, MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with vehicle (V, 0.1% DMSO), KT5720 (10 μmol/liter), AH23848 (10 μmol/liter), or AH6809 (50 μmol/liter) for 24 h. The phosphorylation status of Thr-308 and Ser-473 was studied by phospho-specific antibodies, and the protein level of AKT was used as internal control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) COX-2, CCR7, EP2, and EP4 Were Co-expressed in Breast Tumor Tissues—Our study on breast cancer cell lines clearly indicated that CCR7 was up-regulated by COX-2. In addition, we also found that EP2 and EP4 receptors were up-regulated in COX-2-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells. Therefore, we investigated whether COX-2 and CCR7 were co-expressed in breast tumor tissues as seen in breast cancer cell lines. Breast tumor tissues and their adjacent normal parts from 79 patients were studied. RT-PCR analysis of five tumor tissues is shown in Fig. 6. The expression levels of COX-2 and CCR7 of normal and tumor tissues were normalized with GAPDH and compared. We found that COX-2 and CCR7 were increased in 44.3% (35/79) and 51.9% (41/79) of breast tumor tissues, respectively. χ2 analysis indicated that CCR7 expression was significantly associated with COX-2 expression (p = 0.008; Table 1). COX-2 expression also significantly correlated with EP2 (p = 0.024) and EP4 (p = 0.008) expression. Spearman rank correlation test confirmed that COX-2 expression strongly associated with CCR7 (coefficient = 0.528, p = 0.000), EP2 (coefficient = 0.235, p = 0.037), and EP4 (coefficient = 0.229, p = 0.042). Our data indicated that COX-2 overexpression was associated with up-regulation of CCR7, EP2, and EP4 in breast cancer tissues as found in breast cancer cell lines.TABLE 1Association of COX-2 and CCR7, EP2, and EP4 mRNA expression in breast tumor tissuesCOX-2NUCCR7 N2711 U1724p = 0.008EP2 N3015 U1420p = 0.024EP4 N3518 U917P = 0.008 Open table in a new tab COX-2 and CCR7 Were Up-regulated in Breast Tumor Tissues and Associated with Lymph Node Metastasis—Paired t test clearly indicated that expression of COX-2 and CCR7 was increased in tumor tissues (p = 0.031 and 0.047, respectively). So, we investigated the correlation of COX-2 and CCR7 with clinicopathological parameters. As shown in Table 2, COX-2 expression was not associated with tumor size, histological grade, progesterone receptor, HER-2/neu, and histological type. On the contrary, COX-2 expression was positively associated with lymph node metastasis (p = 0.030) and negatively correlated with estrogen receptor (p = 0.044). CCR7 expression was not correlated with tumor size, histological grade, HER-2/neu, and histological type. However, CCR7 was negatively correlated with estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor. The lack of association of CCR7 with lymph node metastasis was unexpected. We focused on the expression of COX-2 and CCR7 in tumor tissues and compared them in lymph node-negative and lymph node-positive tumors by using Wilcoxon rank sum test. Our data showed that COX-2 expression was more frequently found in tumors with lymph node metastasis (p = 0.040). Similar to the results of χ2 test, no significant association of CCR7 and lymph node metastasis was observed (p = 0.355). However, we found that CCR7 expression was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (p = 0.048) in COX-2-overexpressing tumors when a serial testing was carried out. These data strongly suggested that CCR7 was a critical determinant to predict lymph node metastasis in COX-2-overexpressing tumors. Collectively, our results indicated that COX-2 and CCR7 were up-regulated in breast cancer and were associated with enhancement of lymph node metastasis.TABLE 2Clinicopathological factors associated with COX-2 and CCR7 mRNA expressionFactorsCOX-2CCR7NormalIncreasedNormalIncreasedTumor size ≤2 cm22211726 >2 cm2214p = 0.3752115p = 0.095Histological grade I9283 II25282627 III105p = 0.069411p = 0.065Lymph node metastasis -33182328 +1117p = 0.0301513p = 0.471Estrogen receptor -14191122 +3016p = 0.0442719p = 0.026Progesterone receptor -15191222 +2916p = 0.0722619p = 0.048HER-2/neu 1-2+28162420 3-4+1619p = 0.1111421p = 0.198Histological type Ductal34322937 Lobular2130 Other82p = 0.29464p = 0.119 Open table in a new tab The importance of our study is that we provide a mechanistic insight by which COX-2 promotes breast cancer cells to invade into the lymphatic system. Previous studies have demonstrated that COX-2 expression was associated with lymph node metastasis in breast cancer (21Costa C. Soares R. Reis-Filho J.S. Leitao D. Amendoeira I. Schmitt F.C. J. Clin. Pathol. 2002; 55: 429-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 22Denkert C. Winzer K.J. Muller B.M. Weichert W. Pest S. Kobel M. Kristiansen G. Reles A. Siegert A. Guski H. Hauptmann S. Cancer. 2003; 97: 2978-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). In addition, COX-2 is a negative prognostic factor for disease-free survival and overall survival in patients with breast cancer (22Denkert C. Winzer K.J. Muller B.M. Weichert W. Pest S. Kobel M. Kristiansen G. Reles A. Siegert A. Guski H. Hauptmann S. Cancer. 2003; 97: 2978-2987Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is predictable that COX-2 may contribute to enhancement of lymph node metastasis. However, the underlying mechanism is unknown. Recently, a candidate gene for the mediation of lymph node invasion or lymphangiogenesis by COX-2 has been suggested. Timoshenko et al. (25Timoshenko A.V. Chakraborty C. Wagner G.F. Lala P.K. Br. J. Cancer. 2006; 94: 1154-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) showed that COX-2 expression was strongly correlated with VEGF-C expression in breast cancer. VEGF-C is one of the most potent growth factors for the induction of lymphangiogenesis because the LECs express high amounts of its cognate receptor VEGFR3. The authors showed that COX-2 acted via EP1 and EP4 receptor to increase VEGF-C expression. Furthermore, a selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib potently decreased tumor growth and recurrence by inhibiting COX-2-induced lymphangiogenesis (23Barnes N.L. Warnberg F. Farnie G. White D. Jiang W. Anderson E. Bundred N.J. Br. J. Cancer. 2007; 96: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Similar results have also been found in human lung cancer cell lines and tumor tissues (24Su J.L. Shih J.Y. Yen M.L. Jeng Y.M. Chang C.C. Hsieh C.Y. Wei L.H. Yang P.C. Kuo M.L. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 554-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Because COX-2-induced lymph node metastasis is a complex process, we think VEGF-C is not the only effector of COX-2. In this study, we identified another key player CCR7. A pioneer study demonstrated that the chemokine receptors were involved in breast cancer metastasis, and CCR7 was found to be one of the most consistent up-regulated chemokine receptors in breast tumor tissues (26Muller A. Homey B. Soto H. Ge N. Catron D. Buchanan M.E. McClanahan T. Murphy E. Yuan W. Wagner S.N. Barrera J.L. Mohar A. Verastegui E. Zlotnik A. Nature. 2001; 410: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (4387) Google Scholar). In agreement with these data, we found that CCR7 was up-regulated in 51.9% of breast tumor tissues. Another recent study showed that CCR7 was a novel biomarker for predicting lymph node metastasis in T1 breast cancer (33Cabioglu N. Yazici M.S. Arun B. Broglio K.R. Hortobagyi G.N. Price J.E. Sahin A. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 5686-5693Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Although the association of COX-2 and CCR7 with lymph node metastasis of breast cancer has been separately reported, the functional cross-link between these two genes in the mediation of lymph node metastasis was missing. We provide the first evidence that COX-2 acts via EP2 and EP4 receptor to up-regulate CCR7 expression in breast cancer cells. The increase of CCR7 was important for the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells toward LECs because anti-CCR7 antibody significantly attenuated this effect. Moreover, knockdown of CCR7 in COX-2-overexpressing MDA-MB-231 cells also resulted in reduction of LEC-induced migration (Fig. 2D). These data strongly suggest that CCR7 is a critical mediator for COX-2 to promote lymph node metastasis. The signaling pathways that participated in COX-2-induced CCR7 is another important issue. We found that PKA and AKT were involved in the up-regulation of CCR7 by COX-2. Because activation of EP2 and EP4 increases intracellular cAMP, it is not surprising that PKA is a downstream effector for COX-2 to increase CCR7. Interestingly, similar observations had also been reported in dendritic cells (34Scandella E. Men Y. Gillessen S. Forster R. Groettrup M. Blood. 2002; 100: 1354-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Dendritic cells are antigen-presenting cells and are able to migrate from peripheral tissues to lymph node (35Saeki H. Moore A.M. Brown M.J. Hwang S.T. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2472-2475PubMed Google Scholar). Scandella et al. (34Scandella E. Men Y. Gillessen S. Forster R. Groettrup M. Blood. 2002; 100: 1354-1361Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) demonstrated that PGE2 increased cAMP level and CCR7 expression in dendritic cells. We extend these results by showing that AKT is a downstream mediator of PKA because PGE2, dibutyryl cAMP, and forskolin increased phosphorylation of Thr-308 of AKT, whereas PKA inhibitor KT5720 totally abolished this effect. In addition, ectopic expression of the regulatory subunit of PKA or dominant-negative AKT potently attenuated CCR7 expression. These results suggest that COX-2 acts via a PKA/AKT-dependent pathway to up-regulate CCR7. The most well defined transcription factor that controls CCR7 expression is NF-κB (36Hegde S. Pahne J. Smola-Hess S. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1439-1441Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The functional link between AKT and NF-κB is now under investigation in our laboratory. An important finding of our pathological analysis is the association of COX-2 and CCR7 with lymph node metastasis. Our cell-based study indicates that CCR7 is one of the critical mediators for COX-2 to enhance lymph node invasion. However, the clinical relevance needs to be verified. We studied the expression of COX-2 and CCR7 in breast tumor tissues, and our results confirmed a strong correlation between COX-2 and lymph node metastasis. Since COX-2 exhibits proliferative, angiogenic, and anti-apoptotic activities, it is not surprising that COX-2 is associated with lymph node metastasis. However, we found that CCR7 alone is not significantly linked with lymph node metastasis. Conversely, CCR7 expression in COX-2-expressing tumors is an important predictor for lymph node metastasis. The results suggest that COX-2 may increase CCR7 expression and cooperate with CCR7 to promote lymph node metastasis. Interestingly, we also found that the CCR7 level was negatively associated with progesterone receptor and estrogen receptor. Whether steroid hormones like estrogen and progesterone may regulate CCR7 expression in dendritic cells or cancer cells is still unknown. It is a critical issue for future studies. The results of this study are of great clinical significance. Several strategies for the prevention or treatment of lymph node metastasis in breast cancer are suggested. Because COX-2 is an upstream regulator for CCR7, targeting of COX-2 may possibly reduce CCR7 expression and attenuate metastasis. This hypothesis is strongly supported by our results (Fig. 1, D and E). We think non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and COX-2 inhibitors are good candidates for the prevention or treatment of COX-2-induced lymph node metastasis because these drugs may simultaneously repress the expression of VEGF-C and CCR7 stimulated by COX-2. Another choice is the antibody or specific inhibitors that can block the interaction between CCR7 and its cognate ligand CCL21 and CCL19. Identification of the functional importance of stroma-derived factor-1/CXCR4 interaction in tumor metastasis has led to the intense development of drugs that may inhibit this interaction. Similar concepts can be adapted to the prevention of CCL21/CCR7 interaction. This hypothesis is supported by our results that anti-CCL21 and CCR7 antibodies potently suppress the migration of breast cancer cells toward LECs (Fig. 2, B and C). Collectively, we identify CCR7 as a downstream mediator for COX-2 to promote lymphatic invasion and suggest that inhibition of COX-2 and CCL21/CCR7 interaction may be helpful for the treatment of lymph node metastasis.

https://openalex.org/W1971355336,"Exposing cells to conditions that modulate growth can impair endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein folding, leading to ER stress and activation of the transcription factor, ATF6. ATF6 binds to ER stress response elements in target genes, inducing expression of proteins that enhance the ER protein folding capacity, which helps overcome the stress and foster survival. To examine the mechanism of ATF6-mediated survival in vivo, we developed a transgenic mouse model that expresses a novel conditionally activated form of ATF6. We previously showed that activating ATF6 protected the hearts of ATF6 transgenic mice from ER stresses. In the present study, transcript profiling identified modulatory calcineurin interacting protein-1 (MCIP1), also known as regulator of calcineurin 1 (RCAN1), as a novel ATF6-inducible gene that encodes a known regulator of calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT)-mediated growth and development in many tissues. The ability of ATF6 to induce RCAN1 in vivo was replicated in cultured cardiac myocytes, where adenoviral (AdV)-mediated overexpression of activated ATF6 induced the RCAN1 promoter, up-regulated RCAN1 mRNA, inhibited calcineurin phosphatase activity, and exerted a striking growth modulating effect that was inhibited by RCAN1-targeted small interfering RNA. These results demonstrate that RCAN1 is a novel ATF6 target gene that may coordinate growth and ER stress signaling pathways. By modulating growth, RCAN1 may reduce the need for ER protein folding, thus helping to overcome the stress and enhance survival. Moreover, these results suggest that RCAN1 may also be a novel integrator of growth and ER stress signaling in many other tissues that depend on calcineurin/NFAT signaling for optimal growth and development."

These factors then act in concert with primary response gene products to induce secondary response genes. Although the MyD88 pathway is important for the expression of both primary and secondary response genes, we show that the recruitment of NF-κB, RNA polymerase, and the TATA-binding protein is MyD88-dependent only at secondary response genes. This selective dependence correlates with the fact that MyD88 is required for nucleosome remodeling and histone H3K4 trimethylation at secondary response promoters, whereas rapidly induced primary response promoters are assembled into poised MyD88-independent chromatin structures. At a subset of secondary response promoters, IκBζ was identified as a selective regulator of H3K4 trimethylation and preinitiation complex assembly after nucleosome remodeling. These mechanistic distinctions advance our understanding of the diverse molecular cascades that underlie the differential regulation of pro-inflammatory genes.

Immunol. 2005; 5: 446-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (1241) Google Scholar). Therefore, TLR-mediated innate immune responses are finely controlled through the regulation of signaling cascades and the modulation of gene induction (5Liew F.Y. Xu D. Brint E.K. O'Neill L.A. Nat.

Immunity. 2006; 24: 41-51Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). TLR-mediated signaling consists of at least two pathways, a MyD88-dependent pathway and a TRIF-dependent pathway. In contrast to the selective role of TRIF in TLR3- and TLR4-mediated responses, MyD88 acts downstream of almost all TLRs to promote the activation of a broad range of pro-inflammatory and anti-microbial genes (8Akira S. Uematsu S. Takeuchi O. Cell. 2006; 124: 783-801Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8426) Google Scholar). One gene that is induced in response to TLR signaling is Nfkbiz, which encodes a nuclear IκB family member, IκBζ (9Yamazaki S. Muta T. Takeshige K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 27657-27662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 10Kitamura H. Kanehira K. Okita K. Morimatsu M. Saito M.

Chem. 2001; 276: 12485-12488Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Because Nfkbiz expression is induced rapidly in the absence of new protein synthesis, it is considered to be a primary response gene. Newly synthesized IκBζ protein then triggers the induction of a subset of TLR-dependent secondary genes through the modulation of NF-κB activity (12Motoyama M. Yamazaki S. Eto-Kimura A. Takeshige K. Muta T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 7444-7451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Thus, in IκBζ-deficient mice, rapidly induced primary response genes, including Cxcl2, Cxcl1, and Il23a, were activated normally (13Yamamoto M. Yamazaki S. Uematsu S. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K.

In contrast, impaired expression was observed with a subset of secondary response genes that, in wild-type mice, are induced at relatively late times after TLR stimulation, including Il12b, Il6, and Lcn2 (13Yamamoto M. Yamazaki S. Uematsu S. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Kuwata H. Takeuchi O. Takeshige K. Saitoh T. Yamaoka S. Yamamoto N. Yamamoto S. Muta T. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2004; 430: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Although the mechanism by which IκBζ regulates secondary response genes is not known, accumulating evidence has demonstrated that chromatin structure plays a critical role in gene activation and suppression in cells of the immune system (14Smale S.T. Fisher A.G. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 20: 427-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 15Ansel K.M. Lee D.U. Rao A. Nat.

Nature. 2007; 447: 972-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (890) Google Scholar). Two main mediators, ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling complexes and histone-modifying enzymes, help regulate chromatin structure (19Roth S.Y. Denu J.M. Allis C.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar, 20Lusser A. Kadonaga J.T. BioEssays. 2003; 25: 1192-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 21Cairns B.R. Curr. Opin.

ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to disrupt histone-DNA interactions, whereas histone-modifying enzymes alter the N-terminal tails and core domains of histones to regulate the activation and suppression of transcription. Among these histone modifications, which include acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination, and sumoylation of lysine residues, methylation of specific lysine residues of histones H3 and H4 is well associated with gene activation or suppression. Of particular relevance to this study, di- and tri-methylation of H3 Lys-4 (H3K4) are generally found at genes that are competent for activation, with H3K4 trimethylation often linked to active transcription (24Bernstein B.E. Humphrey E.L. Erlich R.L. Schneider R. Bouman P. Liu J.S. Kouzarides T. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8695-8700Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 25Martin C. Zhang Y. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 6: 838-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (1558) Google Scholar). Initial evidence that chromatin structure may be critical for the differential regulation of primary and secondary response genes following TLR stimulation was provided in an influential study by Saccani et al. (26Saccani S. Pantano S. Natoli G. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Specifically, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments revealed that NF-κB associates rapidly with rapidly induced primary response genes but much more slowly with genes induced with delayed kinetics. Saccani and co-workers (26Saccani S. Pantano S. Natoli G. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 27Natoli G. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 2843-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) hypothesized that the association of NF-κB was delayed because changes in chromatin structure at this latter class of genes must precede NF-κB binding and transcriptional activation. More recently, this hypothesis received support from studies of the SWI/SNF family of ATP-dependent nucleosome remodeling complexes (28Ramirez-Carrozzi V.R. Nazarian A.A. Li C.C. Gore S.L. Sridharan R. Imbalzano A.N. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 282-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). SWI/SNF-dependent nucleosome remodeling was found to be important for the activation of secondary response genes and a subset of primary response genes induced with delayed kinetics. However, nucleosome remodeling by SWI/SNF complexes was not necessary for induction of rapidly induced primary response genes. Further analysis of chromatin structure using a restriction enzyme accessibility assay revealed inducible nucleosome remodeling at the promoters of secondary response and late primary response genes, with constitutively accessible chromatin observed at the promoters of early primary response genes. However, the contributions of specific signaling pathways and transcription factors to the differential regulation of primary and secondary response genes were not examined. The importance of TLR signaling through MyD88 for the induction of a broad range of genes raises the intriguing question of whether the MyD88-dependent pathway makes similar or different contributions to the activation of primary and secondary response genes. The selective role of the primary response gene product IκBζ in regulating a subset of secondary response genes is equally intriguing, as, a priori, it must carry out a function that is not required for the activation of primary response genes. IκBζ could therefore be essential for nucleosome remodeling at a subset of secondary response genes or could catalyze another chromatin-related event that is not necessary for primary response gene activation. In this study, we found that, in murine macrophages responding to LPS through TLR4, MyD88 is required for the recruitment of NF-κB p65, RNA polymerase II (pol II), and the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to secondary response promoters. However, because of redundancy with the TRIF-dependent pathway, MyD88 was not required for the recruitment of these factors to primary response promoters, although it is essential for efficient induction of primary response gene transcription. At the secondary response promoters, MyD88 was also essential for nucleosome remodeling and histone H3K4 trimethylation, whereas primary response promoters were assembled into constitutively open chromatin structures in unstimulated cells, with pre-existing H3K4 trimethylation. Surprisingly, although the function of IκBζ was restricted to secondary response genes, it was not necessary for nucleosome remodeling at these genes, but rather was important for H3K4 trimethylation and preinitiation complex assembly downstream of the remodeling event. Antibodies and Mice—Antibodies against NF-κB p65 (C-20) (sc-372), pol II (H-224) (sc-9001), and TFIID (TBP) (Sl-1) (sc-273) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Antibodies to trimethyl histone H3 (Lys-4) (07-473) and SNF2β/BRG1 (07-478) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Polyclonal anti-IκBζ Ab was obtained by immunizing rabbit with a recombinant protein containing the N-terminal region of murine IκBζ (1–380 amino acids). Myd88-/-, Trif-/-, and Nfkbiz-/- mice were generated as described previously (13Yamamoto M. Yamazaki S. Uematsu S. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Kuwata H. Takeuchi O. Takeshige K. Saitoh T. Yamaoka S. Yamamoto N. Yamamoto S. Muta T. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2004; 430: 218-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 29Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Sanjo H. Takeuchi O. Sugiyama M. Okabe M. Takeda K. Akira S. Science. 2003; 301: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (2445) Google Scholar). All animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use Committee of Kyushu University and Osaka University. Stable Cell Lines—RAW264.7 cells were transfected with pcDNA 3.1 (+)-FLAG-IκBζ. The cells resistant to G418 were selected in the presence of 0.4 mg/ml G418 and cloned. Expression of IκBζ mRNA was determined by real time reverse transcription-PCR, and expression of FLAG-IκBζ protein was monitored by Western blotting using anti-M2 monoclonal Ab (Sigma). Cell Culture—For isolation peritoneal macrophages, mice were intraperitoneally injected with 2 ml of 4% thioglycollate medium (Sigma). Peritoneal exudate cells were isolated from the peritoneal cavity 3 days post-injection. Cells were incubated overnight and washed with PBS. Remaining adherent cells were used as peritoneal macrophages for the experiments. To prepare bone marrow-derived macrophages, bone marrow cells were prepared from femora and passed through nylon mesh. Then cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 30% supernatants of cultured L cells. After 6 days, the cells were used as macrophages for experiments. Macrophage cell line RAW264.7 cells and J774 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 μm 2-mercaptoethanol. Peritoneal macrophages, bone marrow-derived macrophages, and RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with Escherichia coli O55:B5 LPS (Sigma). Quantitative Real Time Reverse Transcription-PCR—Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and 1–2 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) and random primers (Toyobo) after treatment with RQ1 DNase I (Promega). Quantitative real time PCR was performed on an ABI 7000 (Applied Biosystems) using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). All data were normalized to the corresponding gene Eef1a1 encoding elongation factor-1α or 18 S rRNA expression, and the fold difference relative to the elongation factor-1α or 18 S rRNA level was shown. Amplification conditions were 50 °C (2 min), 95 °C (10 min), 40 cycles of 95 °C (15 s), and 60 °C (60 s). Primers of 18 S ribosomal RNA, Cxcl2, Il23a, Tnf, Lcn2, and Nfkbiz were purchased from Assay on Demand (Applied Biosystems). Sequence for Eef1a1, Il12b, Il6, and Cxcl1 are follows: Eef1a1probe, 5′-gcacctgagcagtgaagccagctgct-3′, forward primer 5′-gcaaaaacgacccaccaatg-3′ and reverse primer 5′-ggcctggatggttcaggata-3′; Il12b probe, 5′-ctgcagggaacacatgcccacttg-3′, forward primer 5′-gctcaggatcgctattacaat-3′ and reverse primer 5′-tcttccttaatgtcttccact3′; Il6 probe, 5′-ccttcttgggactgatgctggtgaca-3′, forward primer 5′-ctgcaagagacttccatccagtt-3′ and reverse primer 5′-aagtagggaaggccgtggtt-3′; Cxcl1 probe, 5′-ttgccctcagggccccactg-3′, forward primer 5′-caagaacatccagagcttgaaggt-3′ and reverse primer 5′-gtg gctatgacttcggtttgg-3′. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—Peritoneal macrophages, bone marrow-derived macrophages, or RAW264.7 cells were stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS for the indicated periods. Chromatin was cross-linked by 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. The cells were scraped after washing with PBS and centrifuging at 3000 rpm, and then the pellet was resuspended in SDS buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS). Chromatin was sonicated eight times with 30-s pulses, centrifuged at 14,000 rpm to remove debris, diluted 5-fold with ChIP dilution buffer (16.7 mm Tris-HCl, 167 mm NaCl, 1.2 mm EDTA, 1.1% X-100) supplemented with protease inhibitor, and precleared with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose (Upstate). Diluted chromatin was immunoprecipitated at 4 °C overnight, and immune complexes were absorbed with salmon sperm DNA/protein A-agarose beads, and washed one time with low salt buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA), high salt buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA), LiCl buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 0.25 m LiCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1% Nonidet P-40), and two times with TE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.1), 1 mm EDTA). Immune complexes extracted in elution buffer (1% SDS, 100 mm NaHCO3) were incubated for 4 h at 65 °C to revert DNA-protein cross-links. Then the DNA was extracted by incubation in proteinase K (final 50 μg/ml) buffer for 1 h at 45 °C. The purified DNA was used in PCR to assess the presence of target sequences. Promoter-specific primer was designed to include NF-κB-binding site. Sequence of primers are as follows: 5′-caacagtgtacttacgcagacg-3′ and 5′-ctagctgcctgcctcattctac-3′ in the Cxcl2 promoter; 5′-ctgagcactggagactctgaag-3′ and 5′-gctgggatcatggtgctgtgtt-3′ in the Cxcl1 promoter; 5′-gccacttcctccaagaac-3′ and 5′-tttggaaagttggggacacc-3′ in the Tnf promoter; 5′-atccaaagccctgggaatgtc-3′ and 5′-gggtagtccatcctttaccaa-3′ in the Lcn2 promoter; 5′-agtatctctgcctccttcctt-3′ and 5′-gcaacactgaaaactagtgtc-3′ in the Il12b promoter; 5′-agaagagtgctcatgcttc-3′ and 5′-agctacagacatccccagtctc-3′ in the Il6 promoter; and 5′-gagatggccttgcatgaggat-3′ and 5′-gccagagtctcagtcttcaac-3′ in the iNOS promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation using J774 cells with reduced expression of BRG1/BRM was performed essentially as described (28Ramirez-Carrozzi V.R. Nazarian A.A. Li C.C. Gore S.L. Sridharan R. Imbalzano A.N. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 282-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). In brief, J774 cells (7.5 × 105/well) were seeded in 6-well plates and were transduced with either empty vector or BRG1/BRM short hairpin RNA vector. The BRG1/BRM short hairpin RNA targets a conserved region between BRG1 and BRM mRNAs (TGGAGAAGCAGCAGAAGAT). The cells were infected via spin infections on consecutive days at 2500 rpm for 1.5 h and at 30 °C. After the second spin infection, puromycin (3 μg/ml) selection was started. The enrichment of transduced cells was followed by flow cytometry, and RNA interference-mediated depletion was monitored by Western blot. For chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, BRG1/BRM RNA interference-depleted cells and control cells were stimulated and cross-linked 5 days after the first spin infection. Nuclei Preparation—Peritoneal macrophages or bone marrow-derived macrophages were stimulated with 10 μg/ml LPS for the indicated periods. Cells were scraped and pelleted at 1500 rpm. Cells were washed once with PBS. The cell pellet was resuspended in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.15 mm spermine, and 0.5 mm spermidine) and incubated on ice for 5 min. Nuclei were pelleted at 1000 rpm, followed by washing with RE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine). Restriction Enzyme Accessibility Assay—Restriction enzyme accessibility assay was performed essentially as described (30Weinmann A.S. Plevy S.E. Smale S.T. Immunity. 1999; 11: 665-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 31Zhou L. Nazarian A.A. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 2385-2396Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Isolated cell nuclei and restriction enzyme (100 units) (Il12b promoter and enhancer, SpeI; Il6 promoter, AfIII) were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by adding proteinase K buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2% SDS, 100 ng/ml proteinase K), incubated overnight at 56 °C, followed by genomic DNA isolation. Purified DNA (10–15 μg) was digested to completion to generate reference cleavage products using the following restriction enzymes: KpnI and SphI for the Il12b promoter and enhancer and XbaI and SpeI for Il6. Samples were analyzed by Southern blotting with 32P-labeled gene-specific probes designed at the following regions, Il12b promoter (+64 to +437), Il12b enhancer (-8711 to -9113), and Il6 promoter (-544 to -1043). Different Roles of MyD88 at Primary and Secondary Response Genes—To understand how the MyD88 pathway contributes to the regulation of primary and secondary response genes, we compared LPS-stimulated wild-type and Myd88-/- macrophages. In the mutant cells, the expression of a large number of primary and secondary response genes is known to be severely reduced, despite an intact TRIF-dependent pathway (1Akira S. Takeda K. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2004; 4: 499-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (6518) Google Scholar). For this study, the Cxcl2, Cxcl1, and Tnf genes (encoding MIP2, GRO1, and tumor necrosis factor-α, respectively) were monitored as examples of primary response genes, which are induced rapidly (supplemental Fig. S1A) in the absence of a requirement for new protein synthesis (based on resistance to cycloheximide) (28Ramirez-Carrozzi V.R. Nazarian A.A. Li C.C. Gore S.L. Sridharan R. Imbalzano A.N. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 282-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). The Lcn2, Il12b, and Il6 genes (encoding lipocalin 2, IL-12 p40, and IL-6, respectively) were used as examples of secondary response genes, which are induced with delayed kinetics (supplemental Fig. S1B) in a cycloheximide-sensitive manner (28Ramirez-Carrozzi V.R. Nazarian A.A. Li C.C. Gore S.L. Sridharan R. Imbalzano A.N. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 282-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Although expression of all seven genes was greatly reduced in Myd88-/- macrophages, residual induction was observed with the four primary response genes. This induction was largely eliminated in Myd88-/-Trif-/- macrophages (supplemental Fig. S1C). To determine how the absence of MyD88 signaling alters the cascade of events leading to transcription initiation, ChIP experiments were performed. At the Lcn2 secondary response promoter, the recruitment of the NF-κB p65 subunit, pol II, and TBP was greatly reduced in LPS-stimulated peritoneal macrophages from Myd88-/- mice, when compared with macrophages from wild-type mice (Fig. 1A). Remarkably, these same factors were recruited normally to the Cxcl2 primary response promoter in Myd88-/- macrophages, with only a modest delay in p65 recruitment and perhaps more transient association of pol II (Fig. 1B). Consistent with previous findings (26Saccani S. Pantano S. Natoli G. J. Exp. Med. 2001; 193: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), factor recruitment was observed at earlier time points at the primary response promoter than at the secondary response promoter. Similar results were obtained using bone marrow-derived macrophages (data not shown). Importantly, recruitment of p65, pol II, and TBP to the Cxcl2 promoter was eliminated in Myd88-/-Trif-/- macrophages (Fig. 1C), consistent with previous evidence that NF-κB activation by LPS is only modestly delayed in Myd88-/- macrophages but eliminated in MyD88-/-Trif-/- macrophages (29Yamamoto M. Sato S. Hemmi H. Hoshino K. Kaisho T. Sanjo H. Takeuchi O. Sugiyama M. Okabe M. Takeda K. Akira S. Science. 2003; 301: 640-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (2445) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a hypothesis in which MyD88 is essential for a change in chromatin structure at secondary response promoters that must precede the binding of NF-κB and the assembly of a transcription preinitiation complex. However, at primary response promoters, preinitiation complex assembly is relatively unperturbed because of the following: 1) these genes possess a poised MyD88-independent chromatin structure in unstimulated cells, and 2) the TRIF-dependent pathway can support NF-κB activation in the absence of MyD88. It is important to emphasize that Cxcl2 transcription is severely reduced in Myd88-/- macrophages (supplemental Fig. 1A), despite the efficient recruitment of p65, pol II, and TBP to the Cxcl2 promoter. Possible reasons primary response genes require the MyD88 pathway for efficient induction are considered below (see under “Discussion”). MyD88-dependent H3K4 Trimethylation and Nucleosome Remodeling at Secondary Response Promoters—To test the above hypothesis, we evaluated the importance of MyD88 for the chromatin changes that accompany gene activation in LPS-stimulated macrophages. Trimethylation of histone H3K4 was first examined because of its close association with transcriptionally active genes (23Li B. Carey M. Workman J.L. Cell. 2007; 128: 707-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2613) Google Scholar, 32Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Sherriff J. Bernstein B.E. Emre N.C. Schreiber S.L.

At the promoters of two representative primary response genes, Cxcl2 and Cxcl1, ChIP experiments revealed constitutively high H3K4 trimethylation in unstimulated wild-type macrophages, with no significant change following LPS stimulation (Fig. 2A). These results are consistent with previous evidence that early primary response promoters possess constitutively acetylated histones and constitutively open chromatin structures (28Ramirez-Carrozzi V.R. Nazarian A.A. Li C.C. Gore S.L. Sridharan R. Imbalzano A.N. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 282-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Importantly, similar H3K4 trimethylation levels were observed at these promoters in Myd88-/- macrophages (Fig. 2A). In contrast to the constitutive H3K4 trimethylation observed at the primary response promoters, this modification was strongly induced in LPS-stimulated wild-type macrophages at the promoters for two representative secondary response genes, Lcn2 and Il12b (Fig. 2B). Significantly, the LPS-induced H3K4 trimethylation observed at these promoters was MyD88-dependent. We further examined nucleosome remodeling at the Il12b promoter using a Southern blot-based restriction enzyme accessibility assay (28Ramirez-Carrozzi V.R. Nazarian A.A. Li C.C. Gore S.L. Sridharan R. Imbalzano A.N. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 282-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 31Zhou L. Nazarian A.A. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell.

As demonstrated previously, strong increases in restriction enzyme cleavage efficiency were observed following LPS stimulation in wild-type macrophages (Fig. 2C) (28Ramirez-Carrozzi V.R. Nazarian A.A. Li C.C. Gore S.L. Sridharan R. Imbalzano A.N. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 282-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). However, restriction enzyme cleavage was greatly reduced in Myd88-/- macrophages (Fig. 2C). Taken together, the results in Figs. 1 and 2 strongly suggest that NF-κB, TBP, and pol II cannot associate with the promoters of secondary response genes in LPS-stimulated macrophages from Myd88-/- mice because the MyD88 pathway is required for LPS-induced H3K4 trimethylation and nucleosome remodeling at these promoters. In contrast, the recruitment of NF-κB, TBP, and pol II to primary response promoters does not depend on MyD88 because these promoters are assembled into poised chromatin structures in unstimulated cells. IκBζ Mediates the Activation of a Subset of Secondary Response Genes—The above results suggest that, although the TRIF pathway can support NF-κB activation in LPS-stimulated macrophages from Myd88-/- mice, TRIF cannot support the activation of one or more factors that act prior to nucleosome remodeling and H3K4 trimethylation at MyD88-dependent secondary response promoters. Thus, an MyD88-specific target is essential for nucleosome remodeling and H3K4 trimethylation at these promoters. It is noteworthy that LPS-induced remodeling at a collection of secondary response promoters was previously found to require new protein synthesis (28Ramirez-Carrozzi V.R. Nazarian A.A. Li C.C. Gore S.L. Sridharan R. Imbalzano A.N. Smale S.T. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 282-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar).

https://openalex.org/W2075817699,"Friedreich ataxia is caused by reduced activity of frataxin, a conserved iron-binding protein of the mitochondrial matrix, thought to supply iron for formation of Fe-S clusters on the scaffold protein Isu. Frataxin binds Isu in an iron-dependent manner in vitro. However, the biological relevance of this interaction and whether in vivo the interaction between frataxin and Isu is mediated by adaptor proteins is a matter of debate. Here, we report that alterations of conserved, surface-exposed residues of yeast frataxin, which have deleterious effects on cell growth, impair Fe-S cluster biogenesis and interaction with Isu while altering neither iron binding nor oligomerization. Our results support the idea that the surface of the beta-sheet, adjacent to the acidic, iron binding ridge, is important for interaction of Yfh1 with the Fe-S cluster scaffold and point to a critical role for frataxin in Fe-S cluster biogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2001239597,"The blood brain barrier (BBB) and truncated trkB receptor on astrocytes prevent the penetration of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) applied into the peripheral (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) thus restrict its application in the treatment of nervous diseases. As BDNF is anterogradely transported by axons, we propose that peripherally derived and/or applied BDNF may act on the regeneration of central axons of ascending sensory neurons.The present study aimed to test the hypothesis by using conditioning lesion of the sciatic nerve as a model to increase the expression of endogenous BDNF in sensory neurons and by injecting exogenous BDNF into the peripheral nerve or tissues. Here we showed that most of regenerating sensory neurons expressed BDNF and p-CREB but not p75NTR. Conditioning-lesion induced regeneration of ascending sensory neuron and the increase in the number of p-Erk positive and GAP-43 positive neurons was blocked by the injection of the BDNF antiserum in the periphery. Enhanced neurite outgrowth of dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons in vitro by conditioning lesion was also inhibited by the neutralization with the BDNF antiserum. The delivery of exogenous BDNF into the sciatic nerve or the footpad significantly increased the number of regenerating DRG neurons and regenerating sensory axons in the injured spinal cord. In a contusion injury model, an injection of BDNF into the footpad promoted recovery of motor functions.Our data suggest that endogenous BDNF in DRG and spinal cord is required for the enhanced regeneration of ascending sensory neurons after conditioning lesion of sciatic nerve and peripherally applied BDNF may have therapeutic effects on the spinal cord injury."
https://openalex.org/W2060343252,"Small populations are thought to be adaptively handicapped, not only because they suffer more from deleterious mutations but also because they have limited access to new beneficial mutations, particularly those conferring large benefits.Here, we test this widely held conjecture using both simulations and experiments with small and large bacterial populations evolving in either a simple or a complex nutrient environment. Consistent with expectations, we find that small populations are adaptively constrained in the simple environment; however, in the complex environment small populations not only follow more heterogeneous adaptive trajectories, but can also attain higher fitness than the large populations. Large populations are constrained to near deterministic fixation of rare large-benefit mutations. While such determinism speeds adaptation on the smooth adaptive landscape represented by the simple environment, it can limit the ability of large populations from effectively exploring the underlying topography of rugged adaptive landscapes characterized by complex environments.Our results show that adaptive constraints often faced by small populations can be circumvented during evolution on rugged adaptive landscapes."
https://openalex.org/W1995338592,"The human mu opioid receptor was expressed stably in Flp-In T-REx HEK293 cells. Occupancy by the agonist DAMGO (Tyr-d-Ala-Gly-N-methyl-Phe-Gly-ol) resulted in phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 MAP kinases, which was blocked by the opioid antagonist naloxone but not the cannabinoid CB1 receptor inverse agonist SR141716A. Expression of the human cannabinoid CB1 receptor in these cells from the inducible Flp-In T-REx locus did not alter expression levels of the mu opioid receptor. This allowed the cannabinoid CB1 agonist WIN55212-2 to stimulate ERK1/2 phosphorylation but resulted in a large reduction in the capacity of DAMGO to activate these kinases. Although lacking affinity for the mu opioid receptor, co-addition of SR141716A caused recovery of the effectiveness of DAMGO. In contrast co-addition of the CB1 receptor neutral antagonist O-2050 did not. Induction of the CB1 receptor also resulted in an increase of basal [(35)S]guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPgammaS) binding and thereby a greatly reduced capacity of DAMGO to further stimulate [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding. CB1 inverse agonists attenuated basal [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding and restored the capacity of DAMGO to stimulate. Flp-In T-REx HEK293 cells were generated, which express the human mu opioid receptor constitutively and harbor a modified D163N cannabinoid CB1 receptor that lacks constitutive activity. Induction of expression of the modified cannabinoid CB1 receptor did not limit DAMGO-mediated ERK1/2 MAP kinase phosphorylation and did not allow SR141716A to enhance the function of DAMGO. These data indicate that it is the constitutive activity inherent in the cannabinoid CB1 receptor that reduces the capacity of co-expressed mu opioid receptor to function."
https://openalex.org/W2004475905,"The SLC4A10 gene product, commonly known as NCBE, is highly expressed in rodent brain and has been characterized by others as a Na(+)-driven Cl-HCO(3) exchanger. However, some of the earlier data are not consistent with Na(+)-driven Cl-HCO(3) exchange activity. In the present study, northern blot analysis showed that, also in humans, NCBE transcripts are predominantly expressed in brain. In some human NCBE transcripts, splice cassettes A and/or B, originally reported in rats and mice, are spliced out. In brain cDNA, we found evidence of a unique partial splice of cassette B that is predicted to produce an NCBE protein with a novel C terminus containing a protein kinase C phosphorylation site. We used pH-sensitive microelectrodes to study the molecular physiology of human NCBE expressed in Xenopus oocytes. In agreement with others we found that NCBE mediates the 4,4'-diisothiocyanato-stilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid-sensitive, Na(+)-dependent transport of HCO(3)(-). For the first time, we demonstrated that this transport process is electroneutral. Using Cl(-)-sensitive microelectrodes positioned at the oocyte surface, we found that, unlike both human and squid Na(+)-driven Cl-HCO(3) exchangers, human NCBE does not normally couple the net influx of HCO(3)(-) to a net efflux of Cl(-). Moreover we found that that the (36)Cl efflux from NCBE-expressing oocytes, interpreted by others to be coupled to the influx of Na(+) and HCO(3)(-), actually represents a CO(2)/HCO(3)(-)-stimulated Cl(-) self-exchange not coupled to either Na(+) or net HCO(3)(-) transport. We propose to rename NCBE as the second electroneutral Na/HCO(3) cotransporter, NBCn2."
https://openalex.org/W2073260359,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) exerts multiple cellular effects that stimulate wound repair in multiple tissues. However, a major obstacle for its successful clinical application is the delivery system, which ultimately controls the in vivo release rate of PDGF. Polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) microspheres (MS) in nanofibrous scaffolds (NFS) have been shown to control the release of rhPDGF-BB in vitro. In order to investigate the effects of rhPDGF-BB release from MS in NFS on gene expression and enhancement of soft tissue engineering, rhPDGF-BB was incorporated into differing molecular weight (MW) polymeric MS. By controlling the MW of the MS over a range of 6.5 KDa-64 KDa, release rates of PDGF can be regulated over periods of weeks to months in vitro. The NFS-MS scaffolds were divided into multiple groups based on MS release characteristics and PDGF concentration ranging from 2.5-25.0 microg and evaluated in vivo in a soft tissue wound repair model in the dorsa of rats. At 3, 7, 14 and 21 days post-implantation, the scaffold implants were harvested followed by assessments of cell penetration, vasculogenesis and tissue neogenesis. Gene expression profiles using cDNA microarrays were performed on the PDGF-releasing NFS. The percentage of tissue invasion into MS-containing NFS at 7 days was higher in the PDGF groups when compared to controls. Blood vessel number in the HMW groups containing either 2.5 or 25 microg PDGF was increased above those of other groups at 7d (p<0.01). Results from cDNA array showed that PDGF strongly enhanced in vivo gene expression of the CXC chemokine family members such as CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL5. Thus, sustained release of rhPDGF-BB, controlled by slow-releasing MS associated with the NFS delivery system, enhanced cell migration and angiogenesis in vivo, and may be related to an induced expression of chemokine-related genes. This approach offers a technology to accurately control growth factor release to promote soft tissue engineering in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W1983522840,"Background Compartmentalization and nestedness are common patterns in ecological networks. The aim of this study was to elucidate some of the processes shaping these patterns in a well resolved network of host/pathogen interactions. Methology/Principal Findings Based on a long-term (1972–2005) survey of forest health at the regional scale (all French forests; 15 million ha), we uncovered an almost fully connected network of 51 tree taxa and 157 parasitic fungal species. Our analyses revealed that the compartmentalization of the network maps out the ancient evolutionary history of seed plants, but not the ancient evolutionary history of fungal species. The very early divergence of the major fungal phyla may account for this asymmetric influence of past evolutionary history. Unlike compartmentalization, nestedness did not reflect any consistent phylogenetic signal. Instead, it seemed to reflect the ecological features of the current species, such as the relative abundance of tree species and the life-history strategies of fungal pathogens. We discussed how the evolution of host range in fungal species may account for the observed nested patterns. Conclusion/Significance Overall, our analyses emphasized how the current complexity of ecological networks results from the diversification of the species and their interactions over evolutionary times. They confirmed that the current architecture of ecological networks is not only dependant on recent ecological processes."
https://openalex.org/W2009550533,"Quantitative genetic parameters are nowadays more frequently estimated with restricted maximum likelihood using the 'animal model' than with traditional methods such as parent-offspring regressions. These methods have however rarely been evaluated using equivalent data sets. We compare heritabilities and genetic correlations from animal model and parent-offspring analyses, respectively, using data on eight morphological traits in the great reed warbler (Acrocephalus arundinaceus). Animal models were run using either mean trait values or individual repeated measurements to be able to separate between effects of including more extended pedigree information and effects of replicated sampling from the same individuals. We show that the inclusion of more pedigree information by the use of mean traits animal models had limited effect on the standard error and magnitude of heritabilities. In contrast, the use of repeated measures animal model generally had a positive effect on the sampling accuracy and resulted in lower heritabilities; the latter due to lower additive variance and higher phenotypic variance. For most trait combinations, both animal model methods gave genetic correlations that were lower than the parent-offspring estimates, whereas the standard errors were lower only for the mean traits animal model. We conclude that differences in heritabilities between the animal model and parent-offspring regressions were mostly due to the inclusion of individual replicates to the animal model rather than the inclusion of more extended pedigree information. Genetic correlations were, on the other hand, primarily affected by the inclusion of more pedigree information. This study is to our knowledge the most comprehensive empirical evaluation of the performance of the animal model in relation to parent-offspring regressions in a wild population. Our conclusions should be valuable for reconciliation of data obtained in earlier studies as well as for future meta-analyses utilizing estimates from both traditional methods and the animal model."
https://openalex.org/W2093531204,"Much evidence exists supporting a richer interaction between cognition and action than commonly assumed. Such findings demonstrate that short-timescale processes, such as motor execution, may relate in systematic ways to longer-timescale cognitive processes, such as learning. We further substantiate one direction of this interaction: the flow of cognition into action systems. Two experiments explored match-to-sample paired-associate learning, in which participants learned randomized pairs of unfamiliar symbols. During the experiments, their hand movements were continuously tracked using the Nintendo Wiimote. Across learning, participant arm movements are initiated and completed more quickly, exhibit lower fluctuation, and exert more perturbation on the Wiimote during the button press. A second experiment demonstrated that action dynamics index novel learning scenarios, and not simply acclimatization to the Wiimote interface. Results support a graded and systematic covariation between cognition and action, and recommend ways in which this theoretical perspective may contribute to applied learning contexts."
https://openalex.org/W2044984824,"Superagonistic CD28 antibodies (CD28SAs) activate T lymphocytes without concomitant perturbation of the TCR/CD3-complex. In rodents these reagents induce the preferential expansion of regulatory T cells and can be used for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. Unexpectedly, the humanized CD28 superagonist TGN1412 caused severe and life threatening adverse effects during a recently conducted phase I clinical trail. The underlying molecular mechanisms are as yet unclear. We show that TGN1412 as well as the commercially available CD28 superagonist ANC28.1 induce a delayed but extremely sustained calcium response in human naïve and memory CD4+ T cells but not in cynomolgus T lymphocytes. The sustained Ca++-signal was associated with the activation of multiple intracellular signaling pathways and together these events culminated in the rapid de novo synthesis of high amounts of pro-inflammatory cytokines, most notably IFN-γ and TNF-α. Importantly, sustained transmembranous calcium flux, activation of Src-kinases as well as activation of PI3K were found to be absolutely required for CD28SA-mediated production of IFN-γ and IL-2. Collectively, our data suggest a molecular basis for the severe side effects caused by TGN1412 and impinge upon the relevance of non-human primates as preclinical models for reagents that are supposed to modify the function of human T cells."

In the present study, we demonstrate that inhibition of CFTR expression under ER stress leads to reduced cAMP-activated chloride secretion in epithelial monolayers, an indication of diminished CFTR function.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays established the binding of the UPR-activated ATF6 transcription factor to this region during ER stress, which links the repression to the UPR.

Although the principal mechanisms of the UPR have been studied extensively, only limited information is available regarding the extent and specificity of transcriptional repression during the UPR.

Genes Cells. 2006; 11: 59-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Importantly, neither the extent nor the mechanisms of UPR-associated transcriptional repression have been investigated in mammalian cells. The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), an integral membrane glycoprotein expressed in the apical membrane of epithelial cells, plays a central role in ion transport and multiple regulatory processes (13Amaral M.D. Pediatr. Pulmonol. 2005; 39: 479-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 14Mehta A. Pediatr. Pulmonol. 2005; 39: 292-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 15Riordan J.R. Annu. Rev.

Epithelial cells are often exposed to environmental insults and inflammation that could activate the UPR (7Zhang K. Shen X. Wu J. Sakaki K. Saunders T. Rutkowski D.T. Back S.H. Kaufman R.J. Cell. 2006; 124: 587-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar), and we have previously reported that the UPR inhibits endogenous wild-type (WT) CFTR biogenesis by decreasing mRNA levels, translation, and maturation efficiency. Decreased endogenous CFTR mRNA levels were not the result of enhanced cytosolic RNase activity, and no decreases in transferrin receptor (TR) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA levels were detected. Importantly, activation of the UPR did not affect levels of recombinant CFTR mRNA, suggesting that the transcriptional repression targeted the endogenous CFTR promoter (17Rab A. Bartoszewski R. Jurkuvenaite A. Wakefield J. Collawn J.F. Bebok Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: C756-C766Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Based on this background, the present study was designed to understand the functional consequences of decreased CFTR expression and to explore the molecular mechanism of CFTR transcriptional repression by the UPR. The major regulatory sequences for the human CFTR gene have been identified (for review, see Ref. 18McCarthy V.A. Harris A. Pediatr. Pulmonol. 2005; 40: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and it is acknowledged that CFTR expression is strictly regulated during development (16Bertrand C.A. Frizzell R.A. Am. J.

In contrast, we lack data concerning epigenetic regulation of CFTR expression, especially under pathological conditions. Furthermore, based on recent developments regarding the molecular pathogenesis of other human disorders, it is evident that understanding cellular stress responses in general, and ER stress responses in particular, is necessary for progress against the myriad of human diseases for which cellular stress is a component. These disorders include a growing number of genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF), as well as many neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders (1Zhang K. Kaufman R.J. Neurology. 2006; 66: S102-S109Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 19Kaufman R.J. J. Clin. Invest. 2002; 110: 1389-1398Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar). Decreased CFTR function may also be associated with other chronic airway diseases besides CF, including chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and asthma (20Cantin A.M. Hanrahan J.W. Bilodeau G. Ellis L. Dupuis A. Liao J. Zielenski J. Durie P. Am. J. Respir. Crit.

The molecular pathology is not fully understood for any of these disorders, but several approaches that rescue the folding-deficient ΔF508 CFTR mutant from ERAD have been reported to deliver functional CFTR protein to the cell surface. Such approaches include proteasome inhibition, ER Ca2+ transport blockers, and depletion of ER Ca2+ (22Vij N. Fang S. Zeitlin P.L. J. Biol.

Consequently, and given the emergence of ΔF508 CFTR correction as a therapeutic approach for CF, studies concerning how cellular stress responses might regulate CFTR expression, both at the ER and in post-ER compartments, are of significant interest. In the present study, we tested the functional consequences of decreased endogenous CFTR expression under ER stress. Moreover, we explored the molecular mechanism by which the UPR suppresses CFTR transcription. In addition to enhancing our knowledge of cellular mechanisms behind CF and many other pulmonary diseases, the results presented herein provide novel information regarding UPR-associated transcriptional regulation of membrane protein expression in mammalian cells.

Cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified incubator at 37 °C in 5% CO2. For Ussing chamber studies, Calu-3 cells were grown on permeable supports (6.5-mm diameter Transwell filters, Costar). Antibodies—Monoclonal CFTR C-terminal antibody (24-1) was purified from hybridoma supernatant at the University of Alabama Hybridoma Core Facility (ATCC# HB-11947). Induction of ER Stress and Activation of the UPR—Pharmacological induction of ER stress and activation of the UPR was performed according to previously described methods (9Hong M. Li M. Mao C.

Briefly, following stabilization of the basal current, the solution in the apical chamber was replaced with low chloride Ringer's solution (6 mm sodium gluconate substitution), short-circuit currents (Isc) were measured with an epithelial voltage clamp (VCC-600, Physiologic Instruments, San Diego, CA). A 10-mV pulse of 1-s duration was imposed every 10 s to monitor the transepithelial resistance (Rt), which was calculated using Ohm's law. Isc was activated by addition of 20 μm forskolin and blocked by 200 μm glybenclamide. Results were plotted as ΔIsc (μA/cm2), representing the fraction of current blocked by glybenclamide and normalized to the area of insert. Additionally CFTR inhibitor-172 (20 μm, Calbiochem) was also used to inhibit currents (33Taddei A. Folli C. Zegarra-Moran O. Fanen P. Verkman A.S. Galietta L.J. FEBS Lett. 2004; 558: 52-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Measurement of CFTR Protein Levels—CFTR was immunoprecipitated from 250 μg of total protein, in vitro phosphorylated with [γ-32P]ATP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (Promega, Madison, WI), separated on 6% SDS-PAGE gels, and analyzed using phosphorimaging, as described previously (17Rab A.

Relative Quantification of CFTR mRNA Using Real-time RT-PCR—CFTR mRNA levels were quantified using real-time PCR, as previously described (17Rab A. Bartoszewski R. Jurkuvenaite A. Wakefield J. Collawn J.F. Bebok Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: C756-C766Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Quantification of UPR Reporter and Control mRNA Levels—HSPA5/BiP (assay ID: Hs00607129_gH) and XBP1 (assay ID: Hs00231936_m1) mRNA levels were measured to test for UPR activity. Transferrin receptor (TR, assay ID: Hs99999911_m1) was amplified and measured as an additional control (17Rab A. Bartoszewski R. Jurkuvenaite A. Wakefield J. Collawn J.F. Bebok Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: C756-C766Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). CFTR mRNA Half-life Measurements—CFTR mRNA halflives were measured as described (34Harrold S. Genovese C. Kobrin B. Morrison S.L. Milcarek C. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), with modifications explained below. Cells were grown on 10-cm plastic dishes to ∼80% confluency. Parallel experiments were performed in ER-stressed and control cells. ER stress was induced by 50 μm ALLN or 5 μg/ml TM for 2 h. Actinomycin D (5 μg/ml, Sigma) was added concurrently to stop transcription, after which the RNA was isolated at the indicated time intervals using Qiagen mRNeasy. Actinomycin D and ALLN or TM (in ER-stressed samples) were maintained throughout every experiment (34Harrold S. Genovese C. Kobrin B. Morrison S.L. Milcarek C. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 198: 19-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Total CFTR mRNA levels at each time point were measured as described previously (35Fan J. Yang X. Wang W. Wood 3rd, W.H. Becker K.G. Gorospe M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 10611-10616Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Briefly, mRNA levels were obtained by RT-PCR using a TaqMan-based assay (Applied Biosytems # hs_00357011_m1) and normalized to endogenous 18 S rRNA levels (amplified using a standard primer set, Applied Biosystems # hs_99999901_m1). CFTR mRNA values for each time point were calculated from four individual samples generated in at least two independent experiments. Relative CFTR mRNA levels at the time points indicated were plotted as percent differences from CFTR mRNA levels at the initial time point (t = 0). The mRNA half-lives were calculated from the exponential decay using the trend line equation C/C0 = e–kdt (where C and C0 are mRNA amounts at time t and at the t0, respectively, and kd is the mRNA decay constant), as previously described (36Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). CFTR Gene Promoter Constructs—A human CFTR promoter-driven firefly luciferase reporter construct (pCFTR-pLuc) was purchased from Panomics (Cat. #: LR1020, Panomics Inc., Fremont, CA). This construct contains a 1000-bp fragment of the human CFTR 5′-UTR upstream of firefly luciferase (“1-kb promoter”). Using the 1-kb promoter construct as a template, we created additional reporter vectors containing various fragments of the human CFTR 5′ UTR. To create the “no promoter” construct, our negative control, the 1-kb promoter was excised from the pCFTR-pLuc construct using the flanking NheI and BglII sites. To create the “minimal promoter” construct, the 1-kb promoter region was replaced with a 372-bp segment of the human CFTR regulatory region. This segment, known to be the minimal promoter region of human CFTR (37Rene C. Taulan M. Iral F. Doudement J. L'Honore A. Gerbon C. Demaille J. Claustres M. Romey M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: 5271-5290Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), was amplified by PCR and inserted using the NheI and BglII sites that originally flanked the 1-kb promoter in the pCFTR-pLuc construct. To create the “2.3-kb promoter” construct, the 1-kb promoter sequence was given an additional 1388-bp segment of the human CFTR 5′-UTR. This new sequence was generated by PCR and inserted using the NheI and BglII sites in original pCFTR-pLuc, as before. CFTR Gene Promoter Reporter Assay—To test the transcriptional activity of the human CFTR promoter regions, HeLa cells were transfected with the constructs described above or with control plasmids provided by Panomics. Twenty-four hours before experiments, cells were seeded on 6-well tissue culture plates at ∼40% confluency and transfected using FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science). Each well received 2 μg of total plasmid DNA, 1μg of vector of interest plus 1μgof Renilla luciferase as an internal control. At 12 h post-transfection, cells were given normal medium containing 50 μm ALLN, 30 μm forskolin, 5 μg/ml TM, or a vehicle control for an additional 12 h. At the time points indicated, cells were lysed using luciferase assay lysis buffer (Promega) and firefly/Renilla luciferase activities were measured using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay (Promega), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Results in treated cells were plotted as percent decrease in arbitrary light units compared with control cells. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—ChIP assays were performed as described (38Nozell S. Ma Z. Wilson C. Shah R. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 38577-38589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 39Rodriguez B.A. Huang T.H. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2005; 83: 525-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, control and ER-stressed cells were fixed using formaldehyde that crosslinks and preserves protein-DNA interactions. Cell nuclei were then isolated, suspended in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5) and 1 mm EDTA, and sonicated. The soluble chromatin was placed into radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate 140 mm NaCl) and precleared. Immunoprecipitation was performed with 2–5 μgof appropriate antibody (anti-ATF6α (H-280) and anti-XBP1 (M-186), rabbit polyclonal antibodies, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), and the immune complexes were absorbed to protein A/G beads (Pierce) and blocked with a mixture of bovine serum albumin and salmon sperm DNA. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved by reverse cross-linking, and proteins were removed by digestion. After standardizing DNA content, the sequence of interest was amplified by PCR using specific primers. The PCR products were tested in 1.5% agarose gels in 40 mm Tris acetate (pH 8.3) and 1.0 mm EDTA and stained with ethidium bromide. The ERSE region was amplified using: 5′-GTGAACGT-TAGAAACGAATAGCA-3′ and 5′-GTCGACCTCACCGTCG-CCTA-3′ primers. The CFTR minimal promoter region was amplified using 5′-CTCTGGAAAAGGCCAGCGTT-3′ and 5′-GCATCTTTTTAAAAACTGCT-3′ primers. Inhibition of ER Stress-induced ATF6 Cleavage by the Serine Protease Inhibitor AEBSF—AEBSF is a water-soluble, irreversible serine protease inhibitor that prevents the ER stress-induced cleavage of the Golgi membrane-bound ATF6 (40Okada T.

Calu-3 cells were treated with 300 μm AEBSF (Calbiochem) for 6 h to inhibit ATF6 cleavage. ER stress was induced with TM (5 μg/). When AEBSF and TM were applied together, AESBF was added 1 h prior to TM (29Hung J.H. Su I.J. Lei H.Y. Wang H.C. Lin W.C. Chang W.T. Huang W. Chang W.C. Chang Y.S. Chen C.C. Lai M.D. J. Biol.

Briefly, unmethylated cytosines were converted to uracils using an Applied Biosystems methylSEQr™ bisulfite conversion kit, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Following PCR using primers specific for methylated versus unmethylated DNA, the 5′-UTR region of CFTR was analyzed with Methyl Primer Express® v1.0. The primers used in the final assays were as follows: Fw-5′-CGTTAGAGTAAATTTGGGGTC-3′ and Rv-5′-ATCTCTC-GAACGCTAAAATC-3′. The resulting 246-bp PCR fragments were purified and cloned into the TopoTA vector (Invitrogen), followed by sequencing and analysis. For each condition, at least 20 clones were selected and sequenced. Results were analyzed and presented as previously described (41Piotrowski A. Benetkiewicz M. Menzel U. de Stahl T.D.

DNA MTase and HDAC Inhibitor Studies—Cells were treated with trichostatin A (a DNA MTase inhibitor, 50 ng/ml), 5′-azacytidine (an HDAC inhibitor; 1 μm), or both compounds as specified. RNA was isolated, and CFTR mRNA levels were measured in real-time RT-PCR experiments, as previously described (17Rab A. Bartoszewski R. Jurkuvenaite A. Wakefield J. Collawn J.F. Bebok Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: C756-C766Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—Results were expressed as means ± S.D. Statistical significance among means was determined using the Student's t test (paired and unpaired samples). ER Stress Decreases cAMP-activated Chloride Secretion in Epithelial Monolayers—Using two different human epithelial cell lines that endogenously express WT CFTR (Calu-3 and T84), we had previously demonstrated that pharmacological induction of ER stress and activation of the UPR decrease both the mRNA levels and the protein maturation efficiency of endogenous WT CFTR (17Rab A. Bartoszewski R. Jurkuvenaite A. Wakefield J. Collawn J.F. Bebok Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: C756-C766Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Herein, we used these two cell lines to determine the functional consequences of this decreased CFTR expression in the context of the UPR. To conduct these studies, Calu-3 and T84 cells were treated with TM (5 μg/ml, 6–14 h) to induce ER stress (9Hong M. Li M. Mao C. Lee A.S. J.

Activation of the UPR was monitored by measuring the increase in spliced XBP1 (sXBP1) mRNA, a well accepted indicator of UPR activation (17Rab A. Bartoszewski R. Jurkuvenaite A. Wakefield J. Collawn J.F. Bebok Z. Am. J. Physiol. 2007; 292: C756-C766Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). XBP1 is a transcription factor synthesized upon frameshift splicing of XBP1 mRNA by IRE1 RNase, one of the three ER-localized sensors of the mammalian UPR (42Meunier L. Usherwood Y.K. Chung K.T. Hendershot L.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4456-4469Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The sXBP-1 mRNA encodes a basic leucine zipper transcription factor that mediates ER stress responses by entering the nucleus and binding directly to the UPR element of UPR target genes (42Meunier L. Usherwood Y.K. Chung K.T. Hendershot L.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 4456-4469Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 43Back S.H. Schroder M. Lee K. Zhang K. Kaufman R.J.

https://openalex.org/W2018420303,"Proteins that coat Plasmodium falciparum merozoite surface and those secreted from its apical secretory organelles are considered promising candidates for the vaccine against malaria. In the present study, we have identified an asparagine rich parasite protein (PfAARP; Gene ID PFD1105w), that harbors a predicted signal sequence, a C-terminal transmembrane region and whose transcription and translation patterns are similar to some well characterized merozoite surface/apical proteins. PfAARP was localized to the apical end of the merozoites by GFP-targeting approach using an inducible, schizont-stage expression system, by immunofluorescence assays using anti-PfAARP antibodies. Immuno-electron microsopic studies showed that PfAARP is localized in the apical ends of the rhoptries in the merozoites. RBC binding assays with PfAARP expressed on COS cells surface showed that it binds to RBCs through its N-terminal region with a receptor on the RBC surface that is sensitive to trypsin and neuraminidase treatments. Sequencing of PfAARP from different P. falciparum strains as well as field isolates showed that the N-terminal region is highly conserved. Recombinant protein corresponding to the N-terminal region of PfAARP (PfAARP-N) was produced in its functional form in E. coli. PfAARP-N showed reactivity with immune sera from individuals residing in P. falciparum endemic area. The anti-PfAARP-N rabbit antibodies significantly inhibited parasite invasion in vitro. Our data on localization, functional assays and invasion inhibition, suggest a role of PfAARP in erythrocyte binding and invasion by the merozoite."
https://openalex.org/W2027335534,"Background The visual system can adjust itself to different visual environments. One of the most well known examples of this is the shift in spatial tuning that occurs in retinal ganglion cells with the change from night to day vision. This shift is thought to be produced by a change in the ganglion cell receptive field surround, mediated by a decrease in the coupling of horizontal cells. Methodology/Principal Findings To test this hypothesis, we used a transgenic mouse line, a connexin57-deficient line, in which horizontal cell coupling was abolished. Measurements, both at the ganglion cell level and the level of behavioral performance, showed no differences between wild-type retinas and retinas with decoupled horizontal cells from connexin57-deficient mice. Conclusion/Significance This analysis showed that the coupling and uncoupling of horizontal cells does not play a dominant role in spatial tuning and its adjustability to night and day light conditions. Instead, our data suggest that another mechanism, likely arising in the inner retina, must be responsible."
https://openalex.org/W2075775411,"Hominoid- and human-specific genes may have evolved to modulate signaling pathways of a higher order of complexity. TBC1D3 is a hominoid-specific oncogene encoded by a cluster of eight paralogs on chromosome 17. Initial work indicates that TBC1D3 is widely expressed in human tissues (Hodzic, D., Kong, C., Wainszelbaum, M. J., Charron, A. J., Su, X., and Stahl, P. D. (2006 Genomics 88, 731-736). In this study, we show that TBC1D3 expression has a powerful effect on cell proliferation that is further enhanced by epidermal growth factor (EGF) in both human and mouse cell lines. EGF activation of the Erk and protein kinase B/Akt pathways is enhanced, both in amplitude and duration, by TBC1D3 expression, whereas RNA interference silencing of TBC1D3 suppresses the activation. Light microscopy and Western blot experiments demonstrate that increased signaling in response to EGF is coupled with a significant delay in EGF receptor (EGFR) trafficking and degradation, which significantly extends the life span of EGFR. Moreover, TBC1D3 suppresses polyubiquitination of the EGFR and the recruitment of c-Cbl. Using the Ras binding domain of Raf1 to monitor GTP-Ras we show that TBC1D3 expression enhances Ras activation in quiescent cells, which is further increased by EGF treatment. We speculate that TBC1D3 may alter Ras GTP loading. We conclude that the expression of TBC1D3 generates a delay in EGFR degradation, a decrease in ubiquitination, and a failure to recruit adapter proteins that ultimately dysregulate EGFR signal transduction and enhance cell proliferation. Altered growth factor receptor trafficking and GTP-Ras turnover may be sites where recently evolved genes such as TBC1D3 selectively modulate signaling in hominoids and humans.

Hominoid- or human-specific genes are among the most important resources to have emerged from the completion of the human genome project. Still, we know little about this small group of genes, which presumably modulate or regulate signaling pathways that have evolved to a higher level of complexity and that distinguish hominoids and humans from less complex species. TBC1D3 belongs to a hominoid-specific gene family with no known orthologs outside of the primate lineage (1Hodzic D. Kong C. Wainszelbaum M.J. Charron A.J. Su X. Stahl P.D. Genomics. 2006; 88: 731-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). TBC1D3 was originally identified by Pei et al. as a prostate and breast cancer oncogene (2Pei L. Peng Y. Yang Y. Ling X.B. Van Eyndhoven W.G. Nguyen K.C. Rubin M. Hoey T. Powers S. Li J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5420-5424PubMed Google Scholar). The TBC1D3 genes are arrayed along a region of human chromosome 17 that has undergone extensive intrachromosomal rearrangement and segmental duplication following its probable recent appearance within the hominoid lineage (3Zody M.C.

Chromosome 17 has also been implicated in a wide variety of human genetic diseases and encodes genes involved in breast cancer (BRCA1), neurofibromatosis (NFI), and the DNA damage response (TP53). TBC1D3 (also known as PRC17), which encodes a protein containing a TBC (Tre-2, BUB2, cdc16) domain, was shown to induce tumors in nude mice and growth in low serum when exogenously expressed in mouse 3T3 fibroblasts (2Pei L. Peng Y. Yang Y. Ling X.B. Van Eyndhoven W.G. Nguyen K.C. Rubin M. Hoey T. Powers S. Li J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5420-5424PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work from our laboratory identified eight highly related TBC1D3 paralogs, organized in two clusters within the 17q12 genomic region. These genes potentially encode six individual TBC1D3 variants with differences in a handful of amino acids within the TBC domain. Interestingly, we reported a tissue-specific transcription pattern of TBC1D3 paralogs among normal human tissues and documented alterations in this pattern in several prostate tumors (1Hodzic D.

Activated EGFRs are ubiquitinated, internalized, and transported along the endocytic pathway while maintaining signaling.

Normal tissue morphogenesis, homeostasis, and growth depend on finely orchestrated cellular responses to growth factors and cytokines. Thus, it has been proposed that dysregulation of the endocytic machinery might lead to uncontrolled cell growth by disturbing the specificity and duration of one or more signaling pathways (8Crosetto N. Tikkanen R. Dikic I. FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 3231-3238Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).We speculated that TBC1D3 might modulate EGFR signaling and trafficking events triggering cell proliferation. In the present work, we examined the signaling, trafficking, and fate of the EGFR in murine and human cells expressing or depleted of TBC1D3. We show that the activation of Erk and protein kinase B/Akt pathways, the kinetics of receptor trafficking, and EGF-induced cell proliferation are modulated by TBC1D3 expression. Understanding the mode and mechanism of action of TBC1D3 may provide a unique insight in the “biological rationale” by which recently evolved genes modulate signaling pathways in a human-specific manner and thereby create models for exploring the role of human-specific genes in human metabolic control and physiology.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents—125I-Labeled human EGF and [methyl-3H]thymidine were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Antibodies against phospho-Akt, phospho-MAPK, total Akt, and total MAPK were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Cbl antibody was from BD Transduction Laboratories (Rockville, MD). Monoclonal EGFR (Ab-5) antibody was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Monoclonal Ras and polyclonal EGFR antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Monoclonal α-tubulin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The ubiquitin antibody was from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). The monoclonal antibody directed against the C-terminal 50 amino acids of TBC1D3 was generated by the Hybridoma Center at Washington University (St. Louis, MO). Alexa-Fluor conjugated antibodies were from Molecular Probes (Carlsbad, CA).Construction of Recombinant Retroviruses and Stable Cell Lines Expressing TBC1D3—TBC1D3 paralog D cDNA (HGCN designation), kindly provided by Dr. Jing Li (Tularik Inc, San Francisco, CA), was subcloned into EcoRI/AccI restriction sites of the pBABE-puro vector using the forward primer 5′-CACCATGGACGTGGTAGAGGTCG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-CTAGAAGCCTGGAGGGAACTG-3′. To make stable cell lines, 293T-packaging cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin, and streptomycin. When cells reached 80% confluence, they were transfected with either pBABE-puro:TBC1D3 or empty pBABE-puro along with pCLEco (replication-incompetent helper plasmid) for mouse cells or pUMVC3 plus pCVM-VSV-G for human cells. Retroviral supernatant was collected after 48 h and used with Polybrene (5 μg/ml) to infect either human DU145 prostate cancer cells or mouse NR6 fibroblasts already stably expressing the human EGFR (NR6:hEGFR) (9Chen P. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). After incubation for 48 h the infected cells were selected with medium containing puromycin (2 μg/ml). Single clones were grown to obtain clonal stable cell lines.TBC1D3 Silencing—TBC1D3 was successfully knocked down using a commercial siRNA pool (SMARTpool, Dharmacon). Briefly, DU145 cells were transfected with TBC1D3 siRNA (50 nm final concentration) or irrelevant siRNA (scramble siRNA, Ambion) using Lipofectamine 2000 and were used 36 h later for the appropriate experiments. TBC1D3 depletion was evaluated by RT-PCR. Cells were subjected to RNA extraction in RNase-free conditions using TRIzol (Invitrogen). The RNA was then used to detect TBC1D3 transcript levels by RT-PCR.Cell Proliferation Assay—Cell growth was measured by thymidine incorporation into DNA. The cells (1 × 105 cells/well) were serum-starved and incubated in the presence or absence of 100 ng/ml EGF for 36 h. 1 μCi/ml [methyl-3H]thymidine (2 Ci/mmol) was added in the last 6 h. The cells were then washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA was determined after DNA precipitation with cold 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and cell solubilization in 0.1 m NaOH. Tritium was measured by scintillation counting.Ras Activation Assay—Raf-1 RBD (Ras binding domain) expressed as a GST fusion protein was purified from Escherichia coli by immobilization on glutathione-Sepharose beads and used to affinity precipitate the active form of Ras (Ras-GTP) from cell extracts (10Taylor S.J. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Active Ras precipitation was visualized by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting with a monoclonal pan-Ras antibody.Lysate Preparation, SDS-PAGE, and Western Blotting—To prepare whole cell lysates, cell monolayers were washed with PBS and lysed in ice-cold lysis buffer (PBS, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml pepstatin A, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). The lysates were clarified by centrifugation, and protein concentrations were determined using the BCA Protein Assay Reagent Kit (Pierce). Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were blocked and probed with the indicated antibodies. To determine relative protein amounts, three representative exposures for each sample were quantified using AlphaEaseFc software (Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA).Signaling and EGFR Degradation Assays—Akt and Erk1/2 activation and EGFR degradation were measured in cells serum-starved for 5 h. Cells were incubated in the presence of EGF (100 ng/ml) at 37 °C for different time points, washed with ice-cold PBS, and lysed as described above. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with phospho-Akt, phospho-Erk1/2, and EGFR antibodies.Receptor Internalization—Cells expressing TBC1D3 or vector alone were serum-starved and then incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with 70 ng/ml 125I-EGF (750 Ci/mmol), washed with ice-cold PBS and warmed for different periods of time. At each time point, unbound ligand was removed by washing the monolayer five times with ice-cold PBS. Surface-bound and internalized ligands were measured as described previously (11Sorkin A. Waters C. Overholser K.A. Carpenter G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8355-8362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, surface-bound ligand was collected in ice-cold “acid strip” buffer (50 mm glycine-HCl, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mg/ml polyvinylpyrrolidone, pH 3.0), and internalized ligands were released in 0.1 n NaOH. 125I-EGF was quantified by scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding (∼3%) was tested in the presence of unlabeled human EGF (200 nm, Sigma) and subtracted from the total. EGF internalization rates were estimated as the ratio of internalized to surface-bound EGF.EGFR Turnover—Cells were starved with media lacking cysteine and methionine plus 5% of dialyzed fetal bovine serum for 30 min at 37 °C and were pulse-labeled by incubation with 100 μCi/ml [35S]methionine (1175 Ci/mmol) in the same medium for 1 h. Cells were washed and incubated in cold medium supplemented with 2 mm each cysteine and methionine for the indicated times in the incubator. Thereafter cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer; EGFR was immunoprecipitated by incubation with monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried, and radioactivity was detected by autoradiography.Immunoprecipitation—All immunoprecipitations were performed by lysing the cells in ice-cold immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate plus protease inhibitors). After clarification, protein concentrations were measured, and extracts were immunoprecipitated by incubation with the appropriate antibody followed by immobilization on Protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma). Beads were resuspended in sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot with the indicated antibodies.Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry Analysis of EGFR Ubiquitination—To examine the ubiquitination pattern of the EGFR in cells that express TBC1D3, the ubiquitin-AQUA method was used (12Kirkpatrick D.S. Hathaway N.A. Hanna J. Elsasser S. Rush J. Finley D. King R.W. Gygi S.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 700-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Briefly, NR6:hEGFR: TBC1D3 and NR6:hEGFR:vector cells were grown in 150-mm dishes and treated or untreated with 100 ng/ml EGF for 5 min at 37 °C. Lysates were generated by the addition of TGH solubilization buffer (Triton X-100/glycerol/HEPES) containing 1% sodium deoxycholate and 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide. EGFR was immunoprecipitated by a monoclonal EGFR antibody. After sequential washes with TGH/sodium deoxycholate buffer containing 500 mm, 100 mm, and no NaCl, samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by mass spectrometry using isotope-labeled internal standard peptides as previously described.Immunofluorescence—Cells were seeded onto glass coverslips (12 mm) at 0.5 × 105 per well, serum-starved, and cell-surface EGFR was saturated with 200 ng/ml EGF (Calbiochem) for 1 h at 4 °C. To follow internalization and trafficking of EGF, the cells were washed and placed in complete, pre-warmed (37 °C) media for different times. The coverslips were then washed with ice-cold PBS, and the cells were fixed for 20 min in PBS containing 3% (v/v) paraformaldehyde and autofluorescence quenched in 50 mm NH4Cl. The cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.05% (v/v) Triton X-100 for 10 min, and nonspecific binding sites were blocked with PBS containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 2% goat serum. The coverslips were probed with primary antibodies followed by fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies and mounted onto slides with Fluorescent Mounting Medium (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA). Images were captured using a microscope equipped with a MRC1024 confocal LSM scanhead (Bio-Rad Laboratories).Statistical Analysis—All experiments presented were repeated a minimum of three times. The data represents the mean ± S.D. Student's t test was performed to calculate statistical significance.RESULTSTBC1D3 Increases Cell Growth and Enhances the Proliferative Response to EGF—Initial reports identifying TBC1D3 as an oncogene (2Pei L. Peng Y. Yang Y. Ling X.B. Van Eyndhoven W.G. Nguyen K.C. Rubin M. Hoey T. Powers S. Li J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 5420-5424PubMed Google Scholar) led us to investigate the effect of TBC1D3 expression and silencing on EGF-induced cell proliferation. The studies were carried out in DU145 cells, a well established human prostate carcinoma cell line. The cells were infected with retrovirus encoding TBC1D3D, and the resulting transductants were selected to obtain a clonal cell line expressing TBC1D3 (designated as DU145:TBC1D3). Similar results were obtained when different clonal cell lines were analyzed. DU145:vector (control) or DU145:TBC1D3 cells were incubated in the presence or absence of EGF for 36 h. The incorporation of [3H]thymidine into DNA was used as a measure of cell proliferation. The results (Fig. 1A) are expressed as the percentage of thymidine incorporation over control cells incubated without EGF (set at 100%). DU145:TBC1D3 cells grew more rapidly (∼2-fold), than control cells even in the absence of EGF. In the presence of EGF, both control and DU145:TBC1D3 cells displayed enhanced proliferation. However, EGF-treated DU145:TBC1D3 cells experienced a proliferative response that increased the amount of thymidine incorporation to ∼2.5-fold over that in vehicle-treated cells. Similar results were obtained using other human and mouse cell lines (data not shown). Experiments with murine lines correspond to a true null, because the gene is absent in the mouse genome. These results indicate that proliferation, the furthest downstream response to EGF, is augmented by the presence of TBC1D3, raising the question of how EGFR, TBC1D3, and proliferation are mechanistically linked.TBC1D3 Activates Ras and Enhances Ras Activation in Response to EGF—EGF receptor and other receptor tyrosine kinase are coupled to their downstream targets and to cell proliferation by Ras, which is constitutively activated in many human cancers (13Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether Ras is activated in TBC1D3-expressing cells, GTP-Ras was monitored in cell lysates using the Raf-1 RBD pulldown assay (10Taylor S.J. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. Methods Enzymol. 2001; 333: 333-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). GTP-bound Ras was precipitated with GST-fused Raf-1 RBD from quiescent DU145 cells stably expressing TBC1D3 and control cells. GST alone was used as a control to estimate unspecific binding. The results showed that GTP-Ras was substantially increased (over 2-fold) in cells expressing TBC1D3 under steady-state conditions (Fig. 1B). To examine Ras following EGF stimulation, serum-starved TBC1D3 and control cells were stimulated for 10 min with 100 ng/ml EGF after which the lysates were incubated with GST or GST Raf1-RBD glutathione-Sepharose beads for 1 h. The Western blot in Fig. 1B demonstrates a robust increase in Ras activation in TBC1D3-expressing cells, which is enhanced almost 3-fold in response to EGF when compared with control cells. Similar activation profiles were obtained with other cell lines (data not shown).TBC1D3 and EGF Synergize in the Activation of the Erk1/2 and Akt Pathways—Signaling through Erk1/2 and protein kinase B/Akt are among the earliest post-EGF binding events associated with delayed apoptosis or cell proliferation. To investigate the effect of TBC1D3 on these two pathways, DU145 control or DU145:TBC1D3 cells were incubated with EGF at 37 °C, and levels of phospho-Erk1/2 and phospho-Akt were recorded by Western blotting. Total cellular contents of Erk1/2 or Akt were used to normalize the results in each sample. The data depicted in Fig. 2 show that following EGF stimulation both Erk1/2 and Akt activation were substantially elevated in cells expressing TBC1D3.FIGURE 2TBC1D3 expression enhances activation of Akt and Erk1/2 following EGF stimulation. DU145 cells expressing vector alone or TBC1D3 were serum-starved and incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 100 ng/ml EGF. The cells were washed, lysed, and analyzed by Western blot. The bar graphs were derived from densitometric analysis and show p-Erk1/2 and p-Akt normalized to the actual protein loaded.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)A parallel study, measuring dose response to EGF, was carried out with a well established mouse NR6 fibroblast line that stably expresses both human EGFR (9Chen P. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and TBC1D3 (designated hereafter as NR6:hEGFR:TBC1D3). Murine cells do not express the hominoid-specific TBC1D3, and thus represent a null background, an optimal setting upon which to examine the effects of TBC1D3 expression. As shown in supplemental Fig. S1, control cells (vector alone) incubated with EGF, displayed activation kinetics that reached a maximum at 5 min for both Erk1/2 and Akt. NR6:hEGFR:TBC1D3 cells exhibited a heightened response to each concentration of EGF, also reaching a maximum at 5 min for both Erk1/2 and Akt. Additionally, Erk1/2 signaling in control cells subsided after 5 min, whereas TBC1D3-expressing cells sustained their Erk1/2 activation beyond 30 min. Thus, increases in both the magnitude and duration of Erk1/2 and Akt phosphorylation by TBC1D3 expression may account for the positive impact on cell proliferation observed following EGF stimulation.To rule out misleading phenotypes due to protein overexpression, we used RNA interference to suppress endogenous TBC1D3. DU145 cells were depleted of TBC1D3 using a specific commercial siRNA pool (Dharmacon). Transcript levels were evaluated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR 36 h later. A scrambled, irrelevant siRNA (Ambion) was used as a negative control. The extent of TBC1D3 silencing was ∼70% at the higher concentration assayed (Fig. 3A). Different concentrations of template demonstrated that the reactions fell within the linear range of template versus PCR product. In agreement with the results obtained when overexpressing TBC1D3, silencing TBC1D3 expression suppressed the activation of both Akt and Erk1/2 following EGF stimulation (Fig. 3B). Similar results were obtained with two additional in-house designed siRNAs (data not shown).FIGURE 3TBC1D3 depletion decreases Akt and Erk1/2 activation. A, semi-quantitative RT-PCR. TBC1D3 was suppressed in DU145 cells using a commercial siRNA pool (Dharmacon) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Transcript levels of TBC1D3 (top panel) were determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR from control cells (lanes 1 and 2), cells transfected with irrelevant siRNA (lanes 3 and 4) and cells transfected with TBC1D3 siRNA (lanes 5-10). B, DU145 cells were transfected with TBC1D3 siRNA (50 nm), irrelevant siRNA (irrel) or untransfected (Ctr). 36 h later the cells were serum-starved, incubated with EGF (100 ng/ml) at 37 °C for different time points, and analyzed by Western blot. The bar graphs were derived from densitometric analysis and show p-Erk1/2 and p-Akt normalized to the actual protein loaded.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)EGF Binding and Internalization Are Enhanced by TBC1D3—EGF-EGFR internalization and degradation represent a well studied paradigm for receptor tyrosine kinase trafficking (14Chen W.S.

To examine whether TBC1D3 regulates EGFR-mediated endocytosis, 125I-EGF uptake was measured in NR6:hEGFR: vector and NR6:hEGFR:TBC1D3 cells. Cells were serum-starved and then incubated with 125I-EGF (70 ng/ml) at 4 °C to allow ligand binding. After the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, EGF uptake was evaluated by shifting the cells to 37 °C for different times. As shown in Fig. 4A, EGF accumulation, which plateaued at 15 min, was significantly greater in cells expressing TBC1D3. However, the rate of EGF internalization, expressed as the ratio of internalized to surface-bound EGF, was unaffected by the presence of TBC1D3 (inset in Fig. 4A). When cells were incubated with 125I-EGF for 3 h at 4 °C and surface-bound ligand was released, a 2-fold increase in EGF binding was recorded in cells expressing TBC1D3 (supplemental Fig. S2). Increased cell surface EGF binding and enhanced EGF internalization may be explained by higher levels of EGFR in cells that express TBC1D3. Indeed, TBC1D3-expressing cells contain ∼50% more EGFR at steady state than control cells (Fig. 4B). The data in Fig. 4B (right panel) show the densitometric analysis of multiple Western blots where EGFR signals were normalized to the total protein loaded. Similar results were obtained using human cell lines transiently transfected with TBC1D3 (data not shown).FIGURE 4TBC1D3 increases EGF internalization. A, NR6:hEGFR cells expressing TBC1D3 were serum-starved and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with 125I-EGF (70 ng/ml). Internalization at 37 °C was quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Inset: EGF internalization rate was estimated by the ratios of internalized to surface-bound radioactivity. B, EGFR levels are enhanced in cells expressing TBC1D3. NR6:hEGFR cells expressing TBC1D3 or vector alone were lysed and analyzed by Western blot.

https://openalex.org/W1974495486,"When a selective sweep occurs in the chromosomal region around a target gene in two populations that have recently separated, it produces three dramatic genomic consequences: 1) decreased multi-locus heterozygosity in the region; 2) elevated or diminished genetic divergence (FST) of multiple polymorphic variants adjacent to the selected locus between the divergent populations, due to the alternative fixation of alleles; and 3) a consequent regional increase in the variance of FST (S2FST) for the same clustered variants, due to the increased alternative fixation of alleles in the loci surrounding the selection target. In the first part of our study, to search for potential targets of directional selection, we developed and validated a resampling-based computational approach; we then scanned an array of 31 different-sized moving windows of SNP variants (5–65 SNPs) across the human genome in a set of European and African American population samples with 183,997 SNP loci after correcting for the recombination rate variation. The analysis revealed 180 regions of recent selection with very strong evidence in either population or both. In the second part of our study, we compared the newly discovered putative regions to those sites previously postulated in the literature, using methods based on inspecting patterns of linkage disequilibrium, population divergence and other methodologies. The newly found regions were cross-validated with those found in nine other studies that have searched for selection signals. Our study was replicated especially well in those regions confirmed by three or more studies. These validated regions were independently verified, using a combination of different methods and different databases in other studies, and should include fewer false positives. The main strength of our analysis method compared to others is that it does not require dense genotyping and therefore can be used with data from population-based genome SNP scans from smaller studies of humans or other species."
https://openalex.org/W2054042776,"Constitutive activation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway is observed in up to 70% of acute myelogenous leukemia. To investigate the relevance of an intrinsic PI3K-AKT pathway activation in hematopoietic malignancies, we analysed the effect of point mutations in the catalytic (p110alpha) and regulatory (p85alpha) subunit of class IA PI3K. We demonstrated that mutations in the helical (E542K, E545A) and kinase domain (H1047R) of p110alpha constitutively activate the PI3K-AKT pathway and lead to factor-independent growth of early hematopoietic cells. Proliferation and survival of the cells were inhibited in a time- and dose-dependent manner using either PI3K or AKT inhibitors. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was demonstrated to be important for mitogenic, but not antiapoptotic signaling of mutant p110alpha. In a syngenic mouse model, hematopoietic cells expressing mutated p110alpha induced a leukemia-like disease characterized by anemia, neoplastic infiltration of hematopoietic organs and 90% mortality within 5 weeks, whereas activated mutants of the receptor tyrosine kinase c-KIT led to 100% mortality within 10 days. Our data show that point mutations in the p110alpha subunit of class IA PI3K confer factor independence to hematopoietic cells in vitro and leukemogenic potential in vivo, but have lower transforming activity than a deregulated class III receptor tyrosine kinase."
https://openalex.org/W2067890058,"Background Obesity is associated with macrophage infiltration of adipose tissue, which may link adipose inflammation to insulin resistance. However, the impact of inflammatory cells in the pathophysiology of obesity remains unclear. Tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) is an enzyme expressed by subsets of macrophages and osteoclasts that exists either as an enzymatically inactive monomer or as an active, proteolytically processed dimer. Principal Findings Using mice over expressing TRAP, we show that over-expression of monomeric, but not the dimeric form in adipose tissue leads to early onset spontaneous hyperplastic obesity i.e. many small fat cells. In vitro, recombinant monomeric, but not proteolytically processed TRAP induced proliferation and differentiation of mouse and human adipocyte precursor cells. In humans, monomeric TRAP was highly expressed in the adipose tissue of obese individuals. In both the mouse model and in the obese humans the source of TRAP in adipose tissue was macrophages. In addition, the obese TRAP over expressing mice exhibited signs of a low-grade inflammatory reaction in adipose tissue without evidence of abnormal adipocyte lipolysis, lipogenesis or insulin sensitivity. Conclusion Monomeric TRAP, most likely secreted from adipose tissue macrophages, induces hyperplastic obesity with normal adipocyte lipid metabolism and insulin sensitivity."
https://openalex.org/W2000095831,"Brains decompose the world into discrete objects of perception, thereby facing the problem of how to segregate and selectively address similar objects that are concurrently present in a scene. Theoretical models propose that this could be achieved by neuronal implementations of so-called winner-take-all algorithms where neuronal representations of objects or object features interact in a competitive manner. Here we present evidence for the existence of such a mechanism in an animal species. We present electrophysiological, neuropharmacological and neuroanatomical data which suggest a novel view of the role of GABA(A)-mediated inhibition in primary auditory cortex (AI), where intracortical GABA(A)-mediated inhibition operates on a global scale within a circular map of sound periodicity representation in AI, with functionally inhibitory projections of similar effect from any location throughout the whole map. These interactions could underlie the proposed competitive ""winner-take-all"" algorithm to support object segregation, e.g., segregation of different speakers in cocktail-party situations."
https://openalex.org/W1990996419,"Hedgehog (HH) signaling in the epidermis is primarily mediated by the zinc finger transcription factors GLI1 and GLI2. Exquisite regulation of HH/GLI signaling is crucial for proper specification of the epidermal lineage and development of its derivatives, whereas dysregulation of HH/GLI signaling disrupts tissue homeostasis and causes basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Similarly, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and activins have been described as key signaling factors in the complex regulation of epidermal fate decisions, although their precise interplay with HH/GLI is largely elusive. Here we show that, in human epidermal cells, expression of the activin/BMP antagonist follistatin (FST) is predominantly up-regulated by the HH effector GLI2. Consistently, we found strong FST expression in the outer root sheath of human hair follicles and BCC. Detailed promoter analysis showed that two sequences with homology to the GLI consensus binding site are required for GLI2-mediated activation. Interestingly, activation of the FST promoter is highly GLI2-specific, because neither GLI1 nor GLI3 can significantly increase FST transcription. GLI2 specificity requires the presence of a 518-bp fragment in the proximal FST promoter region. On the protein level, sequences C-terminal to the zinc finger are responsible for GLI2-specific activation of FST transcription, pointing to the existence of GLI-interacting cofactors that modulate GLI target specificity.

Although Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3 can bind the same consensus sequence through a highly conserved zinc finger binding domain (11Hallikas O. Palin K. Sinjushina N. Rautiainen R. Partanen J. Ukkonen E. Taipale J. Cell. 2006; 124: 47-59Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar), there are some well characterized differences between the three Gli proteins. Gli1 has only an activator function, is not proteolytically processed, and lacks the N-terminal repression domain present in Gli2 and in Gli3 (12Sasaki H. Nishizaki Y. Hui C. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H. Development. 1999; 126: 3915-3924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Ruiz i Altaba A. Development. 1999; 126: 3205-3216PubMed Google Scholar), the third Gli family member, which has predominantly repressive activity (14Wang B. Fallon J.F. Beachy P.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 423-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). In contrast to the latent transcription factors Gli2 and Gli3, Gli1 is not directly activated by HH signaling but is a transcriptional target gene of Gli2 and Gli3 (15Dai P. Akimaru H. Tanaka Y.

Differences and overlaps in the roles of the three Glis in development are difficult to resolve in view of the complexity resulting from context-dependent differences in expression and activation state. Insight comes from phenotypes of single and compound mutations: Gli1-/- mice have no phenotype (17Park H.L. Bai C. Platt K.A. Matise M.P. Beeghly A. Hui C.C. Nakashima M. Joyner A.L. Development. 2000; 127: 1593-1605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while Gli2 knockout is lethal (18Ding Q. Motoyama J. Gasca S. Mo R. Sasaki H. Rossant J. Hui C.C. Development. 1998; 125: 2533-2543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Matise M.P. Epstein D.J. Park H.L. Platt K.A. Joyner A.L. Development. 1998; 125: 2759-2770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Mo R.

The compound mutation Gli1-/-, Gli2+/- does have a phenotype, and the double knockout has a more severe phenotype than Gli2-/- alone pointing to an overlap of function (17Park H.L. Bai C. Platt K.A. Matise M.P. Beeghly A. Hui C.C. Nakashima M. Joyner A.L. Development. 2000; 127: 1593-1605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Addressing functional overlap between Gli1 and Gli2, a knock-in of Gli1 into the Gli2 locus leads to dosage-dependent, almost complete rescue, only a hair phenotype is seen postnatally (21Bai C.B. Joyner A.L. Development. 2001; 128: 5161-5172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to this in vivo demonstration of functional equivalence of Gli1 and Gli2 in mouse embryonic development, functional redundancy of activator Glis has also been shown in chick neural tube development (22Stamataki D. Ulloa F. Tsoni S.V. Mynett A. Briscoe J. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 626-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Graded Shh signaling, which is normally mediated by the Gli code represented by the activator and repressor forms of the three Glis (23Ruiz i Altaba A. Nguyen V. Palma V. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2003; 13: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), can be artificially mimicked by a gradient of different Gli3 activator and Gli3 repressor forms (22Stamataki D. Ulloa F. Tsoni S.V. Mynett A. Briscoe J. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 626-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). These results emphasize the common properties of the Gli family members, but there is also considerable evidence for different biochemical and functional properties in contexts that are not related to a phenotype in embryogenesis. The specific effects of expression of each Gli are not completely conserved between vertebrates. In neural tube development the requirements for Gli1 and Gli2 are different for Xenopus, zebrafish, and mouse (24Ruiz i Altaba A. Development. 1998; 125: 2203-2212Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Karlstrom R.O. Tyurina O.V. Kawakami A. Nishioka N. Talbot W.S. Sasaki H. Schier A.F.

Although Gli1 acts as an activator in all three species, its inactivation has no effect in mouse but in zebrafish GLI1 is absolutely required. Gli2 has important repressor function in zebrafish but functions only as an activator in mouse neural tube development (17Park H.L. Bai C. Platt K.A. Matise M.P. Beeghly A. Hui C.C. Nakashima M. Joyner A.L. Development. 2000; 127: 1593-1605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Karlstrom and colleagues propose a function for Gli1 as an important amplifier of an activation signal, which may be required only in some contexts (25Karlstrom R.O. Tyurina O.V. Kawakami A. Nishioka N. Talbot W.S. Sasaki H. Schier A.F. Development. 2003; 130: 1549-1564Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Generally, the relative contribution of any Gli to a process is difficult to unravel, because not only the balance but also cooperativity and physical interaction of the Glis may play a role in establishing the Gli code regulating gene expression (27Nguyen V. Chokas A.L. Stecca B. Altaba A.R. Development. 2005; 132: 3267-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Whether Gli1 and Gli2 are independently or cooperatively involved in HH pathway induced carcinogenesis is not known. In skin, constitutive pathway activation leads to basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and can be caused by mutational inactivation of the receptor/repressor Patched (28Hahn H. Wicking C. Zaphiropoulous P.G.

Science. 1997; 276: 817-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) or either of the transcription factors Gli1 and Gli2 (32Grachtchouk M. Mo R. Yu S. Zhang X. Sasaki H. Hui C.C. Dlugosz A.A.

A. 2000; 97: 3438-3443Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Although GLI1 is most consistently overexpressed in human tumors, including BCC (34Dahmane N. Lee J. Robins P. Heller P. Ruiz i Altaba A. Nature. 1997; 389: 876-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar, 35Ghali L. Wong S.T. Green J. Tidman N. Quinn A.G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 595-599Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), Gli2 was shown to be required for BCC maintenance in a conditional expression model (36Hutchin M.E. Kariapper M.S. Grachtchouk M. Wang A. Wei L. Cummings D. Liu J. Michael L.E. Glick A. Dlugosz A.A. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 214-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines antisense knockdown experiments point to a special role of GLI2 in proliferation and target gene activation (37Kim Y. Yoon J.W. Xiao X. Dean N.M. Monia B.P. Marcusson E.G. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 3583-3593Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that the transcriptional response to overexpression of GLI1 and GLI2 in keratinocytes is only partially overlapping (38Eichberger T. Sander V. Schnidar H. Regl G. Kasper M. Schmid C. Plamberger S. Kaser A. Aberger F. Frischauf A.M. Genomics. 2006; 87: 616-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), suggesting differences in target gene specificity, which may indicate nonredundant function. Apart from moderate quantitative differences there are a number of genes expressed almost exclusively in response to one of the two transcription factors. A striking example is follistatin (FST), an activin/BMP antagonist, which binds activins and several members of the BMP family thereby blocking downstream signaling (reviewed in Refs. 39Harrison C.A. Gray P.C. Vale W.W. Robertson D.M. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2005; 16: 73-78Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar and 40Botchkarev V.A. Sharov A.A. Differentiation. 2004; 72: 512-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). We have investigated the differential transcriptional response in more detail to show that FST is a direct target gene preferentially activated by GLI2 rather than GLI1. Moreover we show that FST is co-expressed with GLI2 in hair follicles and BCC. The role of FST in many different developmental processes and, in particular, skin and hair follicle development was demonstrated not only by the knockout phenotype in mouse (41Matzuk M.M. Lu N. Vogel H. Sellheyer K. Roop D.R. Bradley A. Nature. 1995; 374: 360-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) but also by ectopic induction of feather buds or hair follicles by application of FST (42Patel K. Makarenkova H. Jung H.S. Mech. Dev. 1999; 86: 51-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 43Nakamura M. Matzuk M.M. Gerstmayer B. Bosio A. Lauster R. Miyachi Y. Werner S. Paus R. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 497-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We identified the DNA region responsible for GLI2 specificity by deletion analysis of the FST promoter and localized the relevant region of the protein to the C-terminal part, but outside the VP16-like transactivation domain. This difference between GLI1 and GLI2 suggests a special role of GLI2 in hair follicles and might also affect BCC. Cloning—For the FST promoter reporter plasmid (FSTprom) a 3088-bp MscI fragment of the human BacPac clone RP11–937I3 (obtained from Children's Hospital Oakland Research Institute) containing the putative FST promoter region was cloned into the SmaI restriction site of the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3basic (Promega, Madison, WI). GLI binding sites were mutated at the essential positions 5, 6, and 7 to Gly by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). For FSTdelA and FST-A, FSTprom was digested with AatII/XhoI or NheI/AatII, blunted with T4 polymerase, and re-ligated. The reporter vector 6bsSV40 consists of a 6-Gli binding site cassette (15Dai P. Akimaru H. Tanaka Y. Maekawa T. Nakafuku M. Ishii S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8143-8152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar), which was cloned into the BglII site of pGL3promoter (Promega). For 6bsFST-A, FSTprom was digested with NheI/AatII, blunted with T4 DNA polymerase, and ligated with a blunted BglII fragment containing the Gli binding site cassette of 6bsSV40. GLI1, activated human GLI2 (GLI2act, N-terminally truncated), and GLI121 expression constructs have been described previously (44Regl G. Kasper M. Schnidar H. Eichberger T. Neill G.W. Philpott M.P. Esterbauer H. Hauser-Kronberger C. Frischauf A.M. Aberger F. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 7724-7731Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Activated human GLI3 (GLI3act, amino acids 431–1580) was cloned into p3xFLAG-CMV-10 (Sigma-Aldrich). For the GLI112 expression construct the N-terminal region of GLI1, including the zinc finger (amino acids 1–379), was fused to the C-terminal region of GLI2 (amino acids 254–1258 of GLI2act). Similarly, for GLI221, the N-terminal region of GLI2, including the zinc finger (amino acids 1–253 of GLI2act), was fused to the C-terminal region of GLI1 (amino acids 380–1106). Briefly the N- and C-terminal regions of either GLI protein were amplified by PCR and cloned into the EcoRI/XbaI sites of pBluescript II KS (Stratagene). N-terminal regions were fused to the C-terminal region using a single BspEI site, which was introduced into the GLI sequences. The internal EcoRI site in GLI1 was eliminated by site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting chimeric GLI fusion constructs GLI112 and GLI221 were cloned into the EcoRI/XbaI site of the expression vector pcDNA4/TO (Invitrogen). For GLI1TA2, amino acids 1135–1258 of GLI2act were fused to amino acids 1–1017 of GLI1. The corresponding construct GLI2TA1 was constructed by fusing the C-terminal amino acids 1018–1106 of GLI1 to amino acids 1–1134 of GLI2act. For cloning, an AvrII site was introduced by silent mutagenesis. For the expression construct p4TO-FST344 a 344-amino acid-long isoform of human FST was amplified from the IMAGE clone IRAUp969F0524D (obtained from imaGenes) by PCR and cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of the expression vector pcDNA/4TO (Invitrogen). Cell Culture—HaCaT cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (high glucose, PAA Laboratories) with 10% fetal calf serum (PAA Laboratories), 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 62.5 μg/ml penicillin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. For double stable inducible HaCaT lines expressing either human GLI1 (GLI1-HaCaT) or GLI2act (GLI2-HaCaT) (38Eichberger T. Sander V. Schnidar H. Regl G. Kasper M. Schmid C. Plamberger S. Kaser A.

For growth factor treatment HaCaT cells were cultured in Defined Keratinocyte-SFM medium (Invitrogen) and either treated for 24 h with recombinant human BMP4 (R&D Systems) or for 6 h with recombinant human activin A (R&D Systems). The activin/transforming growth factor-β pathway inhibitor SB431542 (Sigma-Aldrich) dissolved in DMSO (Sigma-Aldrich) was used at a final concentration of 10 μm in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Transgene expression was induced by adding 1 μg/ml tetracycline (Invitrogen) to the medium. Murine keratinocyte line C5N and murine BCC tumor cell lines ASZ001 and CSZ1 (46Xie J. Aszterbaum M.

Western Blot—Cells were lysed in 125 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 5% glycerol, 2% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.006% bromphenol blue, and extracts resolved by SDS-PAGE. GLI2 and FST protein were detected using polyclonal rabbit-anti-GLI2 antibody (GLI2-H300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), affinity-purified polyclonal goat-anti-FST antibody (R&D Systems), secondary goat-anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and a chicken-anti-goat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Proteins were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences). Immunohistochemistry—Staining for FST was performed on routinely formalin-fixed paraffin embedded tissue, using a standardized automated system (Autostainer, Dako) in combination with an Envision detection system (Dako). A mouse monoclonal antibody directed against human FST (R&D Systems, dilution, 1:100) was used. Archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections (4 μm thick) were deparaffinized with xylene, hydrated, followed by heat-induced epitope retrieval in antigen retrieval buffer, pH 9. Endogenous peroxidase blocking was carried out 10 min with 3% H2O2 in absolute methanol, and normal serum was applied. Primary antibodies were incubated at room temperature for 1 h, and after several washes detection was performed using the Envision detection system, followed by development with diaminobenzidine. Slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. qRT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA was isolated and purified (High Pure RNA Isolation Kit, Roche Applied Science), and cDNA was synthesized from 4 μg of total RNA with Superscript II (RNase H-) reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using oligo(dT) primers, according to the manufacturer's instructions. qRT-PCR analysis was performed on a Rotor-Gene 3000 (Corbett Research) using iQ™ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). Human large ribosomal protein P0 (RPLP0) or mouse acidic ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 (Arbp) was used for normalization in qRT-PCR analysis (48Martin K.J. Graner E. Li Y. Price L.M. Kritzman B.M. Fournier M.V. Rhei E. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 2646-2651Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). For primer sequences see supplemental Table S1. Luciferase Reporter Assay—HaCaT cells were grown in 12-well plates to 80% confluence and transfected in triplicate with the respective GLI expression constructs, pGL3 luciferase reporter plasmids as indicated in the figures and Renilla luciferase (pRL-SV40, Promega) expression plasmids for normalization. Transfection was carried out using SuperFect transfection reagent (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured with a LucyII luminometer (Anthos) using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Data were normalized for Renilla luciferase activity. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—EMSA was carried out with 5 μg of recombinant NHIS-GLI2-zinc finger protein (amino acids 409–602 of human GLI2, NP_005261), purified as described before (16Ikram M.S. Neill G.W. Regl G. Eichberger T. Frischauf A.M. Aberger F. Quinn A. Philpott M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2004; 122: 1503-1509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), and 10 ng of [32P]dCTP (Amersham Biosciences) labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide in 30 μl of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 25 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm ZnSO4, 0.77 μg of poly(dI-dC) (Sigma-Aldrich), 10% glycerol. Reactions were incubated for 25 min at room temperature. Competition was carried out with 5- or 10-fold excess of specific (bs1, bs2, or bs3) or mutant unlabeled oligonucleotide (bsm) or 1.2–2.4 μg of poly(dI-dC). Samples were separated on 6% acryl amide gels. Following electrophoresis, gels were dried, exposed overnight, and scanned with a BAS-1800II (Fuji). Oligonucleotides used for EMSA are shown in supplemental Table S3). Chromatin Immunoprecipitation—ChIP was done according to the Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Kit protocol (Upstate), with some modifications. In brief, GLI1- or GLI2-HaCaT cells were grown for 48 h in the presence of 1 μg/ml tetracycline to induce GLI expression. Cells were washed once with warm 1× phosphate-buffered saline prior to addition of Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium containing 1% formaldehyde and incubation for 10 min at room temperature. Cross-linking was stopped by adding 2.5 m glycine to a final concentration of 125 mm. Unless otherwise indicated, all following steps were either performed on ice or at 4 °C, and buffers were supplemented with protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma-Aldrich). Cross-linked cells were washed twice with ice-cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline, scraped, pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in lysis buffer (5 mm PIPES, 85 mm KCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, pH 8), and Dounced to release nuclei. After centrifugation at 5000 rpm, nuclei were lysed in SDS lysis buffer and chromatin was fragmented by sonication with a Sonopuls HD2070 Sonifier (Bandelin Electronics) to an average fragment size between 100 and 1000 bp. Debris was removed by centrifugation, and the size of chromatin checked on agarose gels after de-cross-linking and proteinase digestion. Aliquots corresponding to 107 cells were diluted 1:10 with ChIP dilution buffer. Protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences) was pre-blocked with 1 mg/ml herring sperm DNA (Sigma-Aldrich) and 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (Carl Roth). Each aliquot of chromatin (2 ml) was precleared with 25 μl of a 25% Sepharose slurry for 30 min. Goat polyclonal anti-GLI1 (GLI1-C18), goat polyclonal anti-GLI2 (GLI2-N20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit polyclonal anti acetyl histone H3 (Upstate Biochemicals), or species-matched normal IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added, and samples were incubated with the antibodies overnight with rotation. Antibody complexes were precipitated by addition of 60 μl of pre-blocked 25% Sepharose slurry for 4h, while rotating. Supernatants were removed, from the normal IgG samples 500 μl was kept and processed as input controls, and Sepharose beads were washed twice with each ice-cold wash buffer. Protein-DNA complexes were eluted in 500 μl of elution buffer (0.2% SDS, 100 mm NaHCO3), 20 μl of 5 m NaCl was added, and samples were incubated for at least 5 h in a 65 °C water bath to open cross-links. Input samples were adjusted to 200 mm NaCl and processed as above. After reverting cross-links, eluates and input samples were treated with RNase A and proteinase K, and final DNA clean up was performed with GFX PCR and Gel band kit (Amersham Biosciences), DNA was eluted in 60 μl of RNase and DNase free sterile water, and 3.8 μl of eluates was used for PCR analysis. Input samples were further diluted 1:80, and 3.8 μl was used in PCR reactions. For ChIP-PCR, the FailSafe™ GREEN Real-Time PCR System (Epicenter Biotechnologies) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primers used for PCR are shown in supplemental Table S2. PCR was performed in 10-μl reaction volume in a Rotor-Gene 3000 (Corbett Research). PCR was done in duplicates, both samples were pooled, and products were visualized on 3% MetaPhor (Cambrex Bio Science)/1× Tris-acetate-EDTA gels. Induction of FST Expression in Response to GLI2 in Human Keratinocytes—The activin/BMP antagonist FST was identified as a putative GLI2 target gene in an array-based screen of HaCaT keratinocytes expressing GLI1 (GLI1-HaCaT) or GLI2 activator form (GLI2act) (GLI2act-HaCaT) (38Eichberger T. Sander V. Schnidar H. Regl G. Kasper M. Schmid C. Plamberger S. Kaser A. Aberger F. Frischauf A.M.

In contrast to the majority of GLI target genes identified in this screen, FST was turned on almost exclusively in response to GLI2act and not to GLI1 expression. To verify the specific activation of FST by GLI2, we analyzed FST expression at several time points after GLI2act or GLI1 induction by qRT-PCR (Fig. 1A) and Western blot (Fig. 1C).

https://openalex.org/W2031196122,"Protein kinase C epsilon (PKC epsilon ) acts as an antiapoptotic protein and inhibits tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Members of the TNF receptor superfamily trigger apoptosis independent of the tumor suppressor protein p53, which primarily affects DNA damage-induced apoptosis. We have previously shown that PKC epsilon acts upstream of Akt to inhibit receptor-initiated cell death. Since Akt can regulate p53, we have examined the involvement of p53 in PKC epsilon-mediated TRAIL resistance. Overexpression of PKC epsilon in MCF-7 cells (MCF-7/PKC epsilon ) caused a decrease in p53 and an increase in human homolog of murine double minute 2 (Hdm2) and phospho-Hdm2. Depletion of p53 by siRNA attenuated, whereas depletion of Hdm2 enhanced TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Knockdown of Akt decreased Hdm2 phosphorylation, increased p53 level and potentiated TRAIL-induced cell death. Depletion of epsilon from MCF-7 cells caused an increase in p53, whereas knockdown of p53 caused a decrease in Bid mRNA. Depletion of Akt from MCF-7/PKC epsilon cells resulted in an increase in p53 and Bid. These results suggest that PKC epsilon mediates TRAIL resistance by Akt-mediated phosphorylation of Hdm2 resulting in suppression of p53 expression and downregulation of Bid in MCF-7 breast cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W1966677662,"Many candidates have been proposed as zona pellucida-binding proteins. Without precluding a role for any of those candidates, we focused on mouse sperm protein ZP3R/sp56, which is localized in the acrosomal matrix. The objective of this study was to analyze the role of ZP3R/sp56 in mouse fertilization. We expressed recombinant ZP3R/sp56 as a secreted protein in HEK293 cells and purified it from serum-free, conditioned medium. In the presence of reducing agents, the recombinant ZP3R/sp56 exhibited a molecular weight similar to that observed for the native ZP3R/sp56. Reminiscent of the native protein, recombinant ZP3R/sp56 formed a high molecular weight, disulfide cross-linked oligomer consisting of six or more monomers under non-reducing conditions. Recombinant ZP3R/sp56 bound to the zona pellucida of unfertilized eggs but not to 2-cell embryos, indicating that the changes that take place in the zona pellucida at fertilization affected the interaction of this protein with the zona pellucida. The extent of in vitro fertilization was reduced in a dose-dependent manner when unfertilized eggs were preincubated with recombinant ZP3R/sp56 (74% drop at the maximum concentrations assayed). Eggs incubated with the recombinant protein showed an absence of or very few sperm in the perivitelline space, suggesting that the reduction in the fertilization rate is caused by the inhibition of sperm binding and/or penetration through the zona pellucida. These results indicate that sperm ZP3R/sp56 is important for sperm-zona interactions during fertilization and support the concept that the acrosomal matrix plays an essential role in mediating the binding of sperm to the zona pellucida."
https://openalex.org/W2137664096,"S100A7 is a small calcium binding protein, which has been shown to be differentially expressed in psoriatic skin lesions, as well as in squamous cell tumors of the skin, lung and breast. Although its expression has been correlated to HER+ high-grade tumors and to a high risk of progression, the molecular mechanisms of these S100A7-mediated tumorigenic effects are not well known. Here, we showed for the first time that epidermal growth factor (EGF) induces S100A7 expression in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines. We also observed a decrease in EGF-directed migration in shRNA-downregulated MDA-MB-468 cell lines. Furthermore, our signaling studies revealed that EGF induced simultaneous EGF receptor phosphorylation at Tyr1173 and HER2 phosphorylation at Tyr1248 in S100A7-downregulated cell lines as compared to the vector-transfected controls. In addition, reduced phosphorylation of Src at tyrosine 416 and p-SHP2 at tyrosine 542 was observed in these downregulated cell lines. Further studies revealed that S100A7-downregulated cells had reduced angiogenesis in vivo based on matrigel plug assays. Our results also showed decreased tumor-induced osteoclastic resorption in an intra-tibial bone injection model involving SCID mice. S100A7-downregulated cells had decreased osteoclast number and size as compared to the vector controls, and this decrease was associated with variations in IL-8 expression in in vitro cell cultures. This is a novel report on the role of S100A7 in EGF-induced signaling in breast cancer cells and in osteoclast formation."
https://openalex.org/W2058105803,"Background Although the use of microarray technology has seen exponential growth, analysis of microarray data remains a challenge to many investigators. One difficulty lies in the interpretation of a list of differentially expressed genes, or in how to plan new experiments given that knowledge. Clustering methods can be used to identify groups of genes with similar expression patterns, and genes with unknown function can be provisionally annotated based on the concept of “guilt by association”, where function is tentatively inferred from the known functions of genes with similar expression patterns. These methods frequently suffer from two limitations: (1) visualization usually only gives access to group membership, rather than specific information about nearest neighbors, and (2) the resolution or quality of the relationships are not easily inferred. Methodology/Principal Findings We have addressed these issues by improving the precision of similarity detection over that of a single experiment and by creating a tool to visualize tractable association networks: we (1) performed meta-analysis computation of correlation coefficients for all gene pairs in a heterogeneous data set collected from 2,145 publicly available micorarray samples in mouse, (2) filtered the resulting distribution of over 130 million correlation coefficients to build new, more tractable distributions from the strongest correlations, and (3) designed and implemented a new Web based tool (StarNet, http://vanburenlab.medicine.tamhsc.edu/starnet.html) for visualization of sub-networks of the correlation coefficients built according to user specified parameters. Conclusions/Significance Correlations were calculated across a heterogeneous collection of publicly available microarray data. Users can access this analysis using a new freely available Web-based application for visualizing tractable correlation networks that are flexibly specified by the user. This new resource enables rapid hypothesis development for transcription regulatory relationships."
https://openalex.org/W2148508334,"Schistosoma egg-induced liver granuloma is a dynamic inflammatory reaction that results from complex immune responses to the infection. However, the role of B cells in inflammatory granuloma development is not yet fully understood. We report here that B cell function is required for S. japonicum egg-induced granuloma pathology in early infection. Both OBF-1 knockout mice and µMT mice develop severely reduced hepatic granulomas at five weeks post-infection compared to their wild-type counterparts. In contrast, they display no significant difference in granuloma pathology at eight weeks post-infection. Moreover, we find that B cells and antibodies accumulate in the granulomas of wild-type mice early in the infection, indicating a contribution of the B cell response to the granulomatous inflammation. Furthermore, defects in B cell function markedly reduce liver egg burden. These results suggest an important role for B cells in early granuloma pathology. Surprisingly, we found that the S. japonicum infection destroys the structure of the lymphoid follicles. This disruptive effect is correlated with a severely impaired T cell-dependent antibody response upon challenge with ovalbumin. Thus, these findings reveal a novel aspect of the interaction between Schistosoma and the host immune system."

https://openalex.org/W2086948774,"Tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) is able to catalyze the transfer of both l- and d-tyrosine to the 3' end of tRNA(Tyr). Activation of either stereoisomer by ATP results in formation of an enzyme-bound tyrosyl-adenylate intermediate and is accompanied by a blue shift in the intrinsic fluorescence of the protein. Single turnover kinetics for the aminoacylation of tRNA(Tyr) by D-tyrosine were monitored using stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy. Bacillus stearothermophilus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase binds d-tyrosine with an 8.5-fold lower affinity than that of l-tyrosine (K (D-Tyr)(d) = 102 microm) and exhibits a 3-fold decrease in the forward rate constant for the activation reaction (k (D-Tyr)(3) = 13 s(-1)). Furthermore, as is the case for l-tyrosine, tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase exhibits ""half-of-the-sites"" reactivity with respect to the binding and activation of D-tyrosine. Surprisingly, pyrophosphate binds to the TyrRS.d-Tyr-AMP intermediate with a 14-fold higher affinity than it binds to the TyrRS.l-Tyr-AMP intermediate (K (PPi)(d) = 0.043 for TyrRS.d-Tyr-AMP.PP(i)). tRNA(Tyr) binds with a slightly (2.3-fold) lower affinity to the TyrRS.d-Tyr-AMP intermediate than it does to the TyrRS.l-Tyr-AMP intermediate. The observation that the K (Tyr)(d) and k(3) values are similar for l- and d-tyrosine suggests that their side chains bind to tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase in similar orientations and that at least one of the carboxylate oxygen atoms in d-tyrosine is properly positioned for attack on the alpha-phosphate of ATP."
https://openalex.org/W2049058792,"Background The human TTC4 protein is a TPR (tetratricopeptide repeat) motif-containing protein. The gene was originally identified as being localized in a genomic region linked to breast cancer and subsequent studies on melanoma cell lines revealed point mutations in the TTC4 protein that may be associated with the progression of malignant melanoma. Methodology/Principle Findings Here we show that TTC4 is a nucleoplasmic protein which interacts with HSP90 and HSP70, and also with the replication protein CDC6. It has significant structural and functional similarities with a previously characterised Drosophila protein Dpit47. We show that TTC4 protein levels are raised in malignant melanoma cell lines compared to melanocytes. We also see increased TTC4 expression in a variety of tumour lines derived from other tissues. In addition we show that TTC4 proteins bearing some of the mutations previously identified from patient samples lose their interaction with the CDC6 protein. Conclusions/Significance Based on these results and our previous work with the Drosophila Dpit47 protein we suggest that TTC4 is an HSP90 co-chaperone protein which forms a link between HSP90 chaperone activity and DNA replication. We further suggest that the loss of the interaction with CDC6 or with additional client proteins could provide one route through which TTC4 could influence malignant development of cells."

Several polar amino acids are highly conserved within the SLC38 family. Here, we mutated three of these conserved amino acids, Asn82 in the predicted transmembrane domain 1 (TMD1), Tyr337 in TMD7, and Arg374 in TMD8; and we studied the functional consequences of these modifications. The mutation of N82A virtually eliminated the alanine-induced transport current, as well as amino acid uptake by SNAT2. In contrast, the mutations Y337A and R374Q did not abolish amino acid transport. The Km of SNAT2 for its interaction with Na+, KNa+, was dramatically reduced by the N82A mutation, whereas the more conservative mutation N82S resulted in a KNa+ that was in between SNAT2N82A and SNAT2WT. These results were interpreted as a reduction of Na+ affinity caused by the Asn82 mutations, suggesting that these mutations interfere with the interaction of SNAT2 with the sodium ion. As a consequence of this dramatic reduction in Na+ affinity, the apparent Km of SNAT2N82A for alanine was increased 27-fold compared with that of SNAT2WT.

Although amino acid transport by SNATs is important for the physiological function of many tissues, it plays a particularly critical role in the brain (17Hertz L. Prog. Neurobiol. 1979; 13: 277-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (524) Google Scholar), where it is believed to help shuttle glutamine from astrocytes to neurons via the glutamate-glutamine cycle. This process is essential for recycling the neurotransmitter glutamate. Transport of neutral amino acids by SNAT2 is coupled to the cotransport of Na+ ions, with a proposed coupling stoichiometry of 1 neutral amino acid to 1 Na+ ion (14Mackenzie B. Schafer M.K.

Although the amino acid is a neutral zwitterion, the Na+ ion carries charge. Therefore, it is possible that charged residues in the transmembrane domain of SNAT2 contribute to transport by counterbalancing charge on the substrate/Na+ ion. However, the transmembrane domains (TMDs) of SNAT2 predicted from hydropathy analysis contain only two charged residues, one of which (His304) did not significantly affect the kinetics of Na+ binding to SNAT2 upon mutation to alanine (20Zhang Z. Grewer C. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 2621-2632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In addition to charged residues, amino acids with polar side chains often interact with Na+ ions or charged groups of the amino acid in other Na+-coupled amino acid transporters, of which bacterial homologues have been crystallized (21Zhang Y. Kanner B.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1710-1715Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 22Bismuth Y. Kavanaugh M.P. Kanner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16096-16102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). In any case, it is not known whether amino acids with polar or charged side chains contribute to Na+ and/or substrate binding of SNAT2 and whether they are required for amino acid transport. Here, we have modified by mutagenesis the amino acid residues Asn82, Tyr337, and Arg374, which are highly conserved throughout the mammalian SLC38 members and also some fungal members of the superfamily. Asn82 is localized in the predicted TMD1 (Fig. 1A), in which 87.5% of residues are conserved within the SLC38 transporters, suggesting that TMD1 may be very important for the function of SNAT2. When asparagine 82 was mutated to alanine (N82A) or serine (N82S), the mutant transporters mediated only small transport current and no significant amino acid uptake, whereas the Y337A and R374Q mutations had less effect on amino acid transport. Determination of the effect of Na+ on transport currents showed that the affinities for Na+ and, consequently, alanine were dramatically affected by the N82A mutation, whereas the more conservative mutation N82S resulted in affinities for both alanine and Na+ that were in between SNAT2N82A and SNAT2WT. Together, our results demonstrate that mutations to position 82 interfere with Na+ activation of amino acid transport by SNAT2, suggesting a direct or indirect involvement of Asn82 in Na+ coordination by SNAT2. Molecular Biology and Transient Expression—The cDNA coding for rat SNAT2, which was kindly provided by H. Varoqui, was subcloned into the SacI and NheI sites of a modified pBK-CMV vector (Δ(1098–1300)) (Stratagene), containing the cytomegalovirus promoter for mammalian expression. Wild-type SNAT2 was used for site-directed mutagenesis according to the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), as described by the supplier. The primers for mutation experiments were obtained from the DNA core lab of the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Miami School of Medicine. The complete coding sequences of mutated SNAT2 clones were subsequently sequenced. Wild-type and mutant transporter constructs were used for transient transfection of subconfluent human embryonic kidney cell (HEK293T/17, ATCC number CRL 11268) cultures using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Sciences) according to the instructions of the supplier. Electrophysiological recordings were performed between days 1 and 3 post-transfection. Immunohistochemistry—Immunostaining to test for expression of mutant SNAT2 was performed as follows. Nontransfected or transfected HEK293 cells plated on poly(d-lysine)-coated coverslips were washed two times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then fixed in 3% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 25 min at room temperature. After several washing steps with PBS, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 10 min. After a washing step with PBS, they were blocked with 0.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in PBS for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated with 0.005 mg/ml affinity-purified SNAT2 antibody (synthesized by Bethyl Laboratories. Inc.) in 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. This antibody was raised against a portion of the N terminus of SNAT2, which is located in the cytoplasm. Following primary antibody incubation, the cells were rinsed and incubated for 1 h with anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Cy3 (1:500; Dianova) in PBS containing 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100. After being washed with PBS and water, the cells were mounted with antifade reagent (Molecular Probes) and stored in the dark. The Cy3 immunofluorescence was excited with a mercury lamp, visualized with an inverted microscope (Zeiss) by using a TMR filter set (Omega), and photographed with a digital camera (Canon). Amino Acid Uptake Assay—HEK293 cells were plated on collagen-coated 12-well dishes (1 × 105 cells/well) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), and glutamine (4 mm). 48 h after transfection with vector, wild-type SNAT2, or mutant transporter cDNA, the cells were washed with uptake buffer two times. The uptake buffer contained 140 mm sodium methanesulfonate (NaMes), 2 mm MgMes2, 2 mm calcium gluconate (CaGlu2), 30 mm TrisMes, pH 8.0, 5 mm glucose. The cells were then preincubated in the same buffer for 5 min at 37 °C before the buffer was removed and replaced with fresh buffer containing unlabeled α-methylamino-isobutyric acid (MeAIB) and 0.4 μCi of [14C]MeAIB (PerkinElmer Life Sciences; total concentration, 40 μm). After 1 min of incubation at room temperature, uptake was terminated by washing twice with 1 ml of uptake buffer on ice (after 1 min uptake was in the linear range, as determined by quantifying the time dependence of uptake for times up to 5 min). The cells were then solubilized in 0.5 ml of 1% SDS, and radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting in 3 ml of scintillation fluid. The MeAIB uptake measurements were performed in duplicate. Electrophysiology—SNAT2-mediated currents were recorded with an Adams & List EPC7 amplifier under voltage clamp conditions in the whole cell current recording configuration. The typical resistance of the recording electrode was 2–3 MΩ; the series resistance was 5–8 MΩ. Because the currents induced by substrate, anion, or cation application were small (typically, <200 pA), series resistance (RS) compensation had a negligible effect on the magnitude of the observed currents (<4% error). Therefore, RS was not compensated. The extracellular bath buffer solution contained 140 mm sodium methanesulfonate (NaMes), 2 mm magnesium gluconate (MgGlu2), 2 mm calcium gluconate (CaGlu2), 30 mm Tris, pH 8.0. All of the experiments were conducted at extracellular pH of 8.0 because amino acid transport by SNAT2 is pH-dependent, and the transport rate is maximal at pH 8.0. Under the experimental conditions used in our experiments, alanine is not expected to accumulate in the cytosol to concentrations higher than a few μm. Thus, no trans-inhibition should occur, even after long exposure of the cells to alanine. For testing the [Na+] dependence of the currents, Na+ in the extracellular solution was replaced with N-methylglucamine. The pipette solution contained 140 mm KSCN, 2 mm MgGlu2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.3. For determining the voltage dependence of SNAT2 alanine transport, a combined voltage ramp/solution exchange protocol was used. In this protocol, the cell membrane was initially held at 0 mV before ramping the voltage to its final value (-150 to +90 mV) within 2 s. 2 s after establishing the new voltage, the extracellular solution was changed from no alanine to the final concentration of alanine, followed by ramping the voltage back to 0 mV. The currents were low pass filtered at 1–10 kHz (Krohn-Hite 3200) and digitized with a digitizer board (Axon, Digidata 1200) at a sampling rate of 10–50 kHz, which was controlled by software (Axon PClamp). All of the experiments were performed at room temperature. Rapid Solution Exchange—Rapid solution exchange was performed as described previously (23Grewer C. Watzke N. Wiessner M. Rauen T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9706-9711Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Briefly, substrates were applied to a voltage-clamped, SNAT2-expressing cell suspended at the tip of the current recording electrode by means of a quartz tube (opening diameter, 350 μm) positioned at a distance of ∼0.5 mm to the cell. The linear flow rate of the solutions emerging from the opening of the tube was ∼5–10 cm/s, resulting in typical rise times of the whole cell current of 30–50 ms (10–90%). Data Analysis—Nonlinear regression fits of experimental data were performed with Origin (Microcal Software, Northampton, MA) or Clampfit (pClamp8 software; Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Dose-response relationships of currents were fitted with a Michaelis-Menten-like equation, yielding Km and Imax. Endogenous electrogenic alanine transport activity in HEK293T cells, as measured by current recording from nontransfected cells, is minimal (see “Results”). For the [Na+] dependence of the leak current, the dose-response data were corrected by subtraction of the nonspecific component of the current, which increased linearly with increasing [Na+]. The nonspecific component was determined from nontransfected HEK293 cells. Each experiment was repeated at least three times with at least two different cells. The error bars represent the means ± S.D., unless stated otherwise. Maximum SNAT2-dependent currents, Imax, vary approximately by a factor 3 between different cells, depending on the expression levels of each individual cell. Such changes in expression levels did not affect the Km for the amino acid. The Imax values were obtained by averaging the Imax values from these individual cells. Amino Acid Transport Is Impaired by Mutations to Position Asn82—Application of 10 mm l-alanine to voltage-clamped, SNAT2WT-expressing HEK293 cells resulted in inwardly directed whole cell currents (typical trace shown in Fig. 1A) in the presence of Na+ at the extracellular side of the membrane (V = 0 mV, average current of -122 ± 40 pA, n = 7; gray bars in Fig. 1B). This inward current returned to the base line without considerable overshoot after removal of alanine (supplemental Fig. S1). In contrast, application of 10 mm alanine to SNAT2 with the mutation N82A or the more conservative N82S mutation resulted in small inward currents (Fig. 1A), which were on average 12 ± 5 and 6 ± 3% of the SNAT2WT response, respectively (corrected for nonspecific currents; Fig. 1B). These inward currents in SNAT2N82A, although statistically not significantly larger than control currents at 0 mV, were caused by residual electrogenic transport of alanine, as demonstrated in supplemental Fig. S2 (see also results at -30 to -90 mV, which show inward currents significantly larger than control; Fig. 3C). These results suggest that mutations in position 82 strongly interfere with the ability of SNAT2 to catalyze alanine transport current. Although it is possible that the lack of current activity of SNAT2N82A is caused by a heterogeneous population of transporters with one population that is fully inactive and another small population that has wild-type-like activity, this scenario is unlikely because we do not see any evidence for a heterogeneous population of transporters in our data, such as dose-response curves (Fig. 2). Furthermore, if a small, fully active fraction would be responsible for the residual transport current, then it is expected that this fraction has functional properties similar to those of the wild-type, fully active form. However, the experimental data contradict this expectation, showing that Km values for Na+ and substrate are dramatically changed compared with those of the wild-type transporter (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Mutations in position 82 reduce the apparent amino acid affinity. Apparent affinities for the substrate l-alanine of SNAT2N82A (A), SNAT2N82S (B), SNAT2Y337A (C), SNAT2R374Q (D), and SNAT2WT (E) were determined by recording substrate-induced transport current as a function of [alanine] at 0 mV. The bath solution contained 140 mm NaMes, and the pipette solution contained 140 mm KMes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In contrast to mutations in position 82, the mutation R374Q did not significantly affect the alanine-induced transport current, whereas the Y337A mutation impaired transport current, but not to the same degree as the N82 mutations (Fig. 1B). Nontransfected HEK293 cells showed only little response to 10 mm alanine (-7 ± 4 pA, n = 8; Figs. 1A and B). The lack of alanine-induced transport current in the Asn82 mutant transporters may be caused by reduced expression. To test this possibility, we performed immunostaining experiments with a primary antibody recognizing the intracellular N terminus of SNAT2 in permeabilized cells (supplemental Fig. S3). Nontransfected cells showed no significant immunofluorescence, whereas SNAT2WT-expressing cells were immunostained, showing intracellular labeling, but also fluorescence at the cell boundaries. This result is consistent with the membranous localization of SNAT2 observed in the electrophysiological recordings. This expression pattern of the transporter was not significantly changed in SNAT2N82A and SNAT2N82S, which also showed staining at the cell boundaries. Although diffraction-limited visible light fluorescence microscopy does not allow us to directly differentiate whether the transporters are localized in the membrane or very close to the membrane, the unchanged N82A immunostaining pattern together with the existence of alanine-induced currents suggest that the mutant transporter is, in fact, localized in the membrane. This conclusion is also in agreement with recently published data on the related system N transporter SNAT3 with the analogous mutation N76H, which was shown to be expressed in the membrane (24Schneider H.-P. Broer S. Broer A. Deitmer J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 3788-3798Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To test whether the lack of alanine-induced transport current in SNAT2N82A and SNAT2N82S is caused by a loss of transport activity or by reduced electrogenicity of amino acid transport, we performed amino acid uptake experiments. Whereas wild-type transfected cells showed significant specific MeAIB uptake activity (7-fold higher than vector-transfected control cells), specific uptake was insignificant in SNAT2N82A and SNAT2N82S-transfected cells (Fig. 1B). These results support the electrophysiological analysis of these mutant transporters, indicating that the Asn82 mutations result in a loss of transport as well as uptake activity. Although the R374Q and Y337A mutations also resulted in some loss of MeAIB uptake activity (43 ± 1 and 58 ± 1% of wild-type control, respectively; Fig. 1B), this loss was not as dramatic as that seen for the Asn82 mutations. The loss of alanine transport activity of the mutant transporters may be caused by an increased Km for alanine. To test this possibility, we performed kinetic analysis of alanine-induced transport currents, which showed that the Km of SNAT2N82A for alanine was reduced dramatically compared with the wild-type transporter (V = 0 mV; Fig. 2A and Table 1). The apparent Km of SNAT2N82A for alanine was 5.4 ± 0.8 mm (n = 8), which represents a 27-fold increase compared with that of SNAT2WT (Km = 200 ± 20 μm, n = 5; Fig. 2E and Table 1). The more conservative mutation N82S resulted in a Km for alanine in between the wild-type and N82A transporters (Km = 760 ± 250 μm, n = 5; Fig. 2B and Table 1; but note that transport current is larger for SNAT2N82A), which only increased by 3.5-fold compared with wild-type SNAT2. In contrast to the Asn82 mutations, the R374Q and Y337A mutations had a smaller effect on the Km for alanine, with Km increases of 2–3-fold, which were not statistically significant (Table 1 and Fig. 2, C and D).TABLE 1Km for Ala to SNAT2WT and SNAT2 mutant transporters at different membrane potentials (140 mm intracellular Km values) Two-way ANOVA indicates no significant difference between the groups at 0 and –60 mV.

At this potential, the Km values of SNAT2N82A and SNAT2N82S for alanine were 4.4 ± 0.5 mm (n = 4) and 460 ± 90 μm (n = 5), respectively. The Km value of SNAT2WT for alanine was 120 ± 4 μm at -60 mV (n = 4). Statistical analysis indicated that the voltage dependence of the Km values of the mutant transporters was not significant (Table 1, legend). However, consistent with the data obtained at 0 mV, these results suggest that mutations to position 82, but not to Arg374 and Tyr337 dramatically reduce transport activity and increase the Km of SNAT2 for the substrate. Therefore, the following analyses will focus mainly on the Asn82 mutations. To test whether transport activity of the Asn82 mutant SNAT2s can be restored by an increase in the electrical driving force, we determined the voltage dependence of alanine-induced transport currents. l-Alanine evoked inward transport currents in SNAT2WT (measured 4 s after alanine application and at saturating concentration of amino acid) showed a relatively small dependence on the membrane potential from -60 mV to +60 mV but increased steeply at a potential of -90 mV (1.75 times the current at 0 mV; Fig. 3, B and C). This steep increase may be caused by a slow, voltage-dependent inactivation process, which is most prevalent at negative voltages, because it is not seen in I-V relationships obtained 20 ms after a voltage jump (data not shown). Alanine-induced (10 mm) transport currents mediated by SNAT2N82A, although small compared with SNAT2WT, increased with increasingly negative membrane potential with a steeper voltage dependence (three times in a 90-mV voltage range; Fig. 3, A and C), indicating that increased electrical driving force resulted in higher alanine transport activity of the mutant transporter relative to wild-type SNAT2. Because Na+ binding to SNATs from the extracellular side was proposed to be one of the major voltage-dependent steps in the transport cycle (14Mackenzie B. Schafer M.K. Erickson J.D. Hediger M.A. Weihe E. Varoqui H. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 23720-23730Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), the possibility has to be considered that the mutations in position N82A interfere with Na+ activation of amino acid transport, as described in the next paragraphs. Mutations at Asn82 Inhibit Na+-dependent Anion Leak Currents—SNAT2 is associated with an uncoupled anion conductance that is activated by Na+ binding to SNAT2 but inhibited by the binding of transported amino acid substrates (20Zhang Z. Grewer C. Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 2621-2632Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We used this anion conductance as an assay to test the kinetics of interaction of Na+ with the mutant transporters. At negative voltages, application of 10 mm alanine to SNAT2WT inhibited a tonic anion current caused by outflow of intracellular SCN-, resulting in an apparent outward current (the average value was 360 ± 130 pA at -90 mV; Fig. 4, C and D, n = 5). In contrast, application of 10 mm alanine to SNAT2N82A did not inhibit SCN- outflow current (Fig. 4, A and D, n = 6). SNAT2N82S showed intermediate behavior with small inhibition of anion current at -90 mV (66 ± 9 pA; Fig. 4, B and D, n = 4). The results described in the previous paragraph suggest that the Asn82 mutations either interfere with the ability of SNAT2 to mediate anion current and/or that the Na+ concentration is too low to activate anion current. To differentiate between these possibilities, we determined whether application of higher concentrations of extracellular Na+ could activate anion current in SNAT2N82A- and SNAT2N82S-expressing cells (in the presence of 140 mm intracellular KSCN). For SNAT2WT, 140 mm Na+ mediated la"

A role for the tachykinins in host response to lung challenge has been previously demonstrated but has been focused predominantly on the release of the tachykinins from nerves innervating the lung. We have previously demonstrated the most dramatic phenotype described for the substance P encoding gene preprotachykinin-A (PPT-A) to date in controlling the host immune response to the murine gammaherpesvirus 68, in the lung.In this study we have utilised transgenic mice engineered to co-ordinately express the beta-galactosidase marker gene along with PPT-A to facilitate the tracking of PPT-A expression. Using a combination of these mice and conventional immunohistology we now demonstrate that PPT-A gene expression and substance P peptide are induced in cells of the respiratory tract including tracheal, bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages after viral infection. This induction was observed 24h post infection, prior to observable inflammation and the expression of pro-inflammatory chemokines in this model. Induced expression of the PPT-A gene and peptide persisted in the lower respiratory tract through day 7 post infection.Non-neuronal PPT-A expression early after infection may have important clinical implications for the progression or management of lung disease or infection aside from the well characterised later involvement of the tachykinins during the inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W2002095432,"Current gene- and cell-based therapies have significant limitations which impede widespread clinical application. Taking diabetes mellitus as a paradigm, we have sought to overcome these limitations by ex vivo electrotransfer of a nonviral insulin expression vector into primary hepatocytes followed by immediate autologous reimplantation in a preclinical model of diabetes.In a single 3-hour procedure, hepatocytes were isolated from a surgically resected liver wedge, electroporated with an insulin expression plasmid ex vivo and reimplanted intraparenchymally under ultrasonic guidance into the liver in each of 10 streptozotocin-induced diabetic Yorkshire pigs. The vector was comprised of a bifunctional, glucose-responsive promoter linked to human insulin cDNA. Ambient glucose concentrations appropriately altered human insulin mRNA expression and C-peptide secretion within minutes in vitro and in vivo. Treated swine showed correction of hyperglycemia, glucose intolerance, dyslipidemia and other metabolic abnormalities for > or = 47 weeks. Metabolic correction correlated significantly with the number of hepatocytes implanted. Importantly, we observed no hypoglycemia even under fasting conditions. Direct intrahepatic implantation of hepatocytes did not alter biochemical indices of liver function or induce abnormal hepatic lobular architecture. About 70% of implanted hepatocytes functionally engrafted, appeared histologically normal, retained vector DNA and expressed human insulin for > or = 47 weeks. Based on structural tissue analyses and transcriptome data, we showed that early correction of diabetes attenuated and even prevented pathological changes in the eye, kidney, liver and aorta.We demonstrate that autologous hepatocytes can be efficiently, simply and safely modified by electroporation of a nonviral vector to express, process and secrete insulin durably. This strategy, which achieved significant and sustained therapeutic efficacy in a large preclinical model without adverse effects, warrants consideration for clinical development especially as it could have broader future applications for the treatment of other acquired and inherited diseases for which systemic reconstitution of a specific protein deficiency is critical."
https://openalex.org/W2126248381,"HIV prevalence has recently begun to decline in Zimbabwe, a result of both high levels of AIDS mortality and a reduction in incident infections. An important component in understanding the dynamics in HIV prevalence is knowledge of past trends in incidence, such as when incidence peaked and at what level. However, empirical measurements of incidence over an extended time period are not available from Zimbabwe or elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa. Using mortality data, we use a back-calculation technique to reconstruct historic trends in incidence. From AIDS mortality data, extracted from death registration in Harare, together with an estimate of survival post-infection, HIV incidence trends were reconstructed that would give rise to the observed patterns of AIDS mortality. Models were fitted assuming three parametric forms of the incidence curve and under nine different assumptions regarding combinations of trends in non-AIDS mortality and patterns of survival post-infection with HIV. HIV prevalence was forward-projected from the fitted incidence and mortality curves. Models that constrained the incidence pattern to a cubic spline function were flexible and produced well-fitting, realistic patterns of incidence. In models assuming constant levels of non-AIDS mortality, annual incidence peaked between 4 and 5% between 1988 and 1990. Under other assumptions the peak level ranged from 3 to 8% per annum. However, scenarios assuming increasing levels of non-AIDS mortality resulted in implausibly low estimates of peak prevalence (11%), whereas models with decreasing underlying crude mortality could be consistent with the prevalence and mortality data. HIV incidence is most likely to have peaked in Harare between 1988 and 1990, which may have preceded the peak elsewhere in Zimbabwe. This finding, considered alongside the timing and location of HIV prevention activities, will give insight into the decline of HIV prevalence in Zimbabwe."
https://openalex.org/W2160854837,"Anion exchanger 2 (AE2, SLC4A2) is a ubiquitously expressed membrane solute carrier that regulates intracellular pH (pHi) by exchanging cytosolic bicarbonate for extracellular chloride. We used fibroblasts from Ae2-deficient (Ae2a,b–/–) mice to study the effects of an alkaline shift in resting intracellular pH (pHi) on the activation of cAMP signaling and gene expression. Ae2a,b–/– fibroblasts show increased pHi (by 0.22 ± 0.03 unit) compared with wild type cells at extracellular pH (pHo) 7.4 and 37 °C. This shift in resting pHi is associated with an up-regulation of bicarbonate-activated soluble adenylyl cyclase expression, increased cAMP production, Creb phosphorylation, inducible cAMP early repressor 1 mRNA expression, and impaired activation of c-Fos transcription by forskolin. These results highlight the importance of bicarbonate transport via Ae2 in maintaining pHi homeostasis in cultured mouse fibroblasts and unveil the role of cAMP in the cellular response to chronic alkalization, which putatively includes an inducible cAMP early repressor 1-mediated attenuation of phosphorylated Creb activity.

Fluctuations of intracellular and extracellular pH are among the most frequent challenges that living cells must overcome during their life span. The first line of defense against potentially harmful pHi changes, apart from the limited buffering capacity of the cytosol, is comprised of several electrolyte transporter proteins in the plasma membrane, which can import or export acid-base equivalents in a pHi-dependent manner (1Alper S.L. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2002; 64: 899-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Among these, the sodium-independent anion exchanger family of transporters (AE, SLC4A1–3) mediates the extrusion of base equivalents in the form of bicarbonate, coupled with the electroneutral import of chloride (2Pushkin A. Kurtz I. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 290: F580-F599Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). In particular, AE2 (SLC4A2) is considered to be a housekeeping regulator of pHi, because of its broad pattern of expression (3Medina J.F. Lecanda J. Acin A. Ciesielczyk P. Prieto J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 267: 228-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 4Lecanda J. Urtasun R. Medina J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), combined with the ability to respond to intracellular alkalization by increasing its transport activity (5Stewart A.K. Chernova M.N. Kunes Y.Z. Alper S.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 281: C1344-C1354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These properties distinguish AE2 from the closely related transporters AE1 and AE3. AE1 (SLC4A1) expression is highly restricted to the erythroid cell lineage and acid-secreting cells in the kidney, and its activity is not regulated by pH. AE3 (SLC4A3) is mostly expressed in excitable cells from cardiac and neural tissue. The intrinsic pH-sensing properties of most acid-base transporters allow for rapid cellular adaptation to transient pHi changes. Chronic pHi or pHo changes, on the other hand, may trigger alternative long term responses as to maintain pHi homeostasis or adapt to a new pHi set point. Even though changes in gene expression in response to acid and/or alkaline challenges in several cell types have been reported (6Petronini P.G. Alfieri R. Campanini C. Borghetti A.F. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 322-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 7Bumke M.A. Neri D. Elia G.

It has been proposed that soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC), 2The abbreviations used are: sAC, soluble adenylyl cyclase; Creb, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein; Icer1, inducible cAMP early repressor 1; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RT, reverse transcription; Gapdh, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; Crem, cAMP response element modulator protein. 2The abbreviations used are: sAC, soluble adenylyl cyclase; Creb, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein; Icer1, inducible cAMP early repressor 1; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; RT, reverse transcription; Gapdh, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; PKA, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; Crem, cAMP response element modulator protein. a distinct form of adenylyl cyclase activated by bicarbonate could function as both a metabolic and a pHi sensor (8Zippin J.H. Levin L.R. Buck J. Trends Endocrinol.

In this way, sAC would constitute a second line of response to pHi disturbances, one that could have an impact on cell signaling, protein trafficking, and gene expression (8Zippin J.H. Levin L.R.

If so, it would imply that changes in intracellular bicarbonate concentration, ultimately controlled by the rates of bicarbonate/proton generation, consumption, and/or transport, are the primary signals in this pathway.

Physiol. 1988; 255: C844-C856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at 37 °C. After 1 h of equilibration, fluorescence (535-nm excitation, 490- and 440-nm emission) was monitored every 30 s in a Novostar multiplate reader (BMG Labtechnologies, Offenburg, Germany). At the end of the experiment a single-point calibration was performed by perfusing cells with 10 μm nigericin in high K+ buffer at pH 7.0 (19Boyarsky G. Ganz M.B. Sterzel R.B. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: C844-C856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pHi was calculated by interpolating normalized 490 nm/440 nm ratios in a standard curve obtained by perfusing cells with 10 μm nigericin, high K+ buffers at 9 different pHo between 5.8 and 8.2. The standard curve was adjusted to pass through the point (fluorescence ratio, 1.0; pH 7.0) and subjected to least squares nonlinear fitting as described elsewhere (19Boyarsky G. Ganz M.B. Sterzel R.B. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: C844-C856Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All of the calculations were done in Prism v4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). RT-PCR and Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was isolated from Ae2a,b+/+ and Ae2a,b–/– fibroblasts with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and reverse transcription was performed on 5 μg of total RNA. 0.5 μg of the resulting cDNA was subjected to PCR for Ae2a, Ae2b1, Ae2b2, Ae2c1, Nhe1, Nhe2, Nhe3, sAC (truncated and full length), and Gapdh using the primer pairs listed in supplemental Table S1. Stomach, liver, kidney, testis, and small intestine cDNA samples were used as positive PCR controls (not shown). Quantitative real time PCR for Ae1, Ae3, Nbce1, Nkcc1, Slc26a1, Slc26a2, Slc26a6, Ca2, T-sAC, Icer1, and Gapdh was performed on 50 ng of template cDNA in a LightCycler apparatus (Roche Applied Science). Most primer pair sequences for quantitative PCR were obtained from the mouse qPrimerDepot data base (supplemental Table S1) (20Cui W. Taub D.D. Gardner K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2007; 35: D805-D809Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Initial RNA concentrations were calculated by linear regression using LinReg v. 9.16 software (21Ramakers C. Ruijter J.M. Deprez R.H. Moorman A.F. Neurosci. Lett. 2003; 339: 62-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (2880) Google Scholar). The results are expressed either as relative expression of ratios to Gapdh mRNA in arbitrary units or as a percentage of the control value, which in all cases is the ratio of mRNA to Gapdh mRNA in Ae2+/+ fibroblasts cultured at pHo 7.4. Cell Fractionation and Immunodetection of sAC, Creb, pCreb, and Ca2—1 × 107 cells were seeded 48 h before the experiment. Nuclear, membrane, and cytosolic fractions were prepared as described elsewhere (22Sakai J. Duncan E.A. Rawson R.B. Hua X. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1996; 85: 1037-1046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). 30 μg of total protein from each fraction were separated by SDS-PAGE and electrotransferred to nylon membranes. Blots of total lysates or appropriate subcellular fractions were incubated as indicated with anti-sAC (R51, 1:1000, kindly provided by Dr. J. Buck), anti-Creb (1:500; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), anti-Ser(P)133-Creb (1:500, Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA), anti-Mrp4, or anti-Mrp5 (1:2000; both kindly provided by Dr. G. Scheffer), or anti-β-actin (1:2000; Sigma) antibodies. Proper secondary antibody-peroxidase conjugates (Bio-Rad) were detected in a Lumimager (Roche Applied Science) after incubation with chemiluminiscent substrate (Roche Applied Science). Immunoblot signals were normalized using β-actin as a loading control. The results are expressed as fold change relative to Ae2+/+ fibroblasts under normal culture conditions. cAMP Measurements—Total, extracellular, and intracellular cAMP was measured in fibroblast cultures with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Amersham Biosciences). Extracellular cAMP was calculated as the difference between total and intracellular cAMP concentrations for each sample. Treatments with 10 μm rolipram, 25 μm forskolin, or vehicle (Me2SO) were applied from 1000× stocks 12 h after seeding and 12 h prior to the determination of cAMP. The results are expressed as fmol of cAMP/106 cells. Statistics—The results are expressed as the means ± S.D. Sample size corresponds to the number of independently processed cell preparations. Differences between groups were tested for statistical significance (p < 0.05) using the two-tailed Student's t test in Prism v4.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). All of the data are representative of at least two independent experiments. Ae2 Expression in Murine Fibroblasts—We performed RT-PCR analysis on total RNA samples from wild type and knockout fibroblasts to assess the expression of Ae2 isoforms. Of the five Ae2 variants, only Ae2a, Ae2b1, and Ae2b2 mRNAs were detected in wild type fibroblasts (Fig. 1A). Ae2a appears to be the predominant variant in this cell type, which is in good agreement with the general pattern of expression of Ae2 isoforms (4Lecanda J. Urtasun R. Medina J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 276: 117-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). On the other hand, Ae2a,b–/– cells express low levels of a mutant Ae2 transcript, which yields a PCR product of expected smaller size (Fig. 1A, top panel). This mutant transcript lacks a region comprising three exons (2, 1a, and 1b), which contains the start codons for Ae2a, b1, and b2 (16Medina J.F. Recalde S. Prieto J. Lecanda J. Saez E. Funk C.D. Vecino P. van Roon M.A. Ottenhoff R. Bosma P.J. Bakker C.T. Oude Elferink R.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 15847-15852Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Exon 1 constitutes only part of the 5′-untranslated region of Ae2 mRNA; therefore this mutant mRNA is not translated into a functional polypeptide (18Recalde S. Muruzabal F. Looije N. Kunne C. Burrell M.A. Saez E. Martinez-Anso E. Salas J.T. Mardones P. Prieto J. Medina J.F. Oude Elferink R.P. Am. J.

Jiang L. Wilhelm S. Kim E.H. Chernova M.N. Kinne R.K. Stewart A.K. Alper S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 1885-1896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), could not be detected in Ae2+/+ or Ae2a,b–/– cells (data not shown). Relative Expression of Acid-Base Transporters and Resting pHi in Ae2+/+ versus Ae2a,b–/– Fibroblasts—The lack of Ae2 transport activity in knockout fibroblasts might lead to compensatory changes in the expression of other acid-base transporters. The electrogenic sodium/bicarbonate cotransporter 1 (Nbce1, Slc4a4) and the sodium/potassium/2 chloride cotransporter 1 (Nkcc1, Slc12a2) mediate sodium-driven bicarbonate and chloride import, respectively, in several tissues (23Russell J.M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 211-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). In nonepithelial cells NBCe1 participates in pHi regulation by protecting cells from intracellular acid loads. NKCC1, on the other hand, is responsible for maintaining intracellular chloride homeostasis and regulating cellular volume (23Russell J.M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 211-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Both transporters share overlapping substrates and opposing functions with Ae2. Other candidates that may compensate for the absence of Ae2 are the remaining members of the Slc4 family, the Slc9 family of sodium/proton exchangers (Nhe) (24Wakabayashi S. Shigekawa M. Pouyssegur J. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 51-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), and the less specific sulfate-bicarbonate/chloride exchangers from the Slc26 family (25Mount D.B. Romero M.F. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 710-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). We quantified relative mRNA expression levels of Slc4a1 (Ae1), Slc4a3 (Ae3), Slc4a4 (Nbce1), Slc26a1 (Sat1), Slc26a2 (Dtdst), and Slc26a6 (Pat-1) (Fig. 1C). Ae1 and Slc26a1 were barely detectable, as could be anticipated considering their rather tissue-specific expression. Nbce1 expression is relatively low in both cell lines (less than 5% of other prominent transporters), whereas Nhe1, Nkcc1, and Slc26a6 expression is comparable between wild type and knockout fibroblasts. Expression of Nhe2 and Nhe3 could not be observed in fibroblasts (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, Ae3 and Slc26a2 mRNA levels are up-regulated in Ae2a,b–/– fibroblasts, by 25 and 100%, respectively. Ae3 is normally expressed in excitable tissue (brain, muscle), and Slc26a2, also known as Dtdst (diastrophic dysplasia sulfate transporter), is expressed at particularly high levels in the intestine, cartilage, and osteoblasts, where it is mainly involved in sulfate import (25Mount D.B. Romero M.F. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 710-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Even though Ae3 is capable of mediating bicarbonate exchange, it is not as efficient as Ae2, nor has it a marked pH-responsive pattern of transport (26Sterling D. Casey J.R. Biochem. J. 1999; 344: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Slc26a2, on the other hand, has no demonstrated bicarbonate transport activity, unlike other members of the Slc26 family (25Mount D.B. Romero M.F. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 710-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Therefore, the physiological significance of Ae3 and Slc26a2 expression, in terms of pHi regulation, is not clearly defined, and their up-regulation in Ae2a,b–/– fibroblasts could rather indicate a regulatory response to altered electrolyte homeostasis. A more definite proof for the relative importance of Ae2 in pHi homeostasis was obtained by direct measurement of pHi in Ae2-deficient cells. We used the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye BCECF to determine intracellular pH under standard tissue culture-like conditions. Table 1 shows that Ae2a,b–/– fibroblasts display a significant 0.22 ± 0.03 unit increase in resting pHi compared with wild type cells, suggesting that Ae2a is indeed the primary acid loader at the cell surface in murine fibroblasts and that its absence cannot be sufficiently compensated by other bicarbonate extruders present in these cells, such as Ae3.TABLE 1Intracellular pH in mouse fibroblastsGenotypepHiAe2+/+7.45 ± 0.04Ae2a,b-/-7.67 ± 0.03ap < 0.002 (n = 6 cell preparations).a p < 0.002 (n = 6 cell preparations). Open table in a new tab Soluble Adenylyl Cyclase Expression Is Induced in Ae2a,b–/– Fibroblasts—Recently, Sun et al. (27Sun X.C. Cui M. Bonanno J.A. BMC Physiol. 2004; 4: 8Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that bicarbonate up-regulates sAC expression in corneal endothelial and Calu-3 cells. The higher pHi observed in Ae2a,b–/– fibroblasts, when maintained under high extracellular volume and open tissue culture conditions, is likely to be associated with higher intracellular bicarbonate concentration. We therefore performed quantitative RT-PCR to determine sAC expression in mouse fibroblasts. As depicted in Fig. 2B, there is a 4.5-fold increase in mRNA levels for the most active (28Jaiswal B.S. Conti M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 31698-31708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), truncated form of sAC (T-sAC) in Ae2a,b–/–, as compared with wild type cells. This is also apparent in a conventional RT-PCR (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained for the full-length form of sAC (data not shown). Immunoblots of subcellular fractions show that sAC protein levels are also higher in knockout fibroblasts, albeit not to the same extent as mRNA (Fig. 2C). The majority of sAC immunoreactivity was found in nuclear fractions, in good agreement with previous reports in COS7 cells and other cell types (10Zippin J.H. Farrell J. Huron D. Kamenetsky M. Hess K.C. Fischman D.A. Levin L.R. Buck J. J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 527-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 29Zippin J.H. Chen Y. Nahirney P. Kamenetsky M. Wuttke M.S. Fischman D.A. Levin L.R. Buck J. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). A small fraction of sAC co-purified with cellular membranes (Fig. 2C), and an even smaller amount, per μgof total protein, was found in cytosolic fractions (not shown). Nuclear sAC protein levels are 40% higher in Ae2a,b–/– when compared with wild type fibroblasts. cAMP Production Is Increased in Ae2a,b–/– Fibroblasts—We hypothesized that the combination of higher pHi (or HCO3−]i) and up-regulated sAC expression in Ae2a,b–/– cells might result in increased rates of cAMP synthesis and higher steady state levels of cAMP. As shown in Fig. 3, there is a significant 30% increase in total cAMP in Ae2a,b–/– fibroblasts. Interestingly, this difference was accounted for by a 100% increase in extracellular cAMP (Fig. 3A), suggesting that cAMP export pathways are more active in knockout cells. This was corroborated by treating cells with 25 μm forskolin, which does not affect sAC activity but activates adenylate cyclase at the plasma membrane to produce maximal amounts of cAMP. Forskolin produced a comparable 7–8-fold increase in total cAMP levels in both Ae2+/+ and Ae2a,b–/– fibroblasts (Fig. 3C), with a much greater fraction of cAMP accumulating in the extracellular medium from Ae2a,b–/– cultures when compared with wild type cells (Fig. 3, D and E). It has been shown that the organic anion transporters Mrp4 and Mrp5 can mediate the active secretion of cAMP and/or cGMP from cells (30Wielinga P.R. van der Heijden I. Reid G. Beijnen J.H. Wijnholds J. Borst P. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17664-17671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). However, immunoblots stained for Mrp4 and Mrp5 indicate that the expression of these proteins in Ae2a,b–/– fibroblasts is comparable with that observed in wild type cells (not shown). Treatment with 10 μm rolipram, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, resulted in a 2.8-fold accumulation of total cAMP in both wild type and knockout cells (Fig. 3B), which suggests that cAMP degradation is not significantly compromised by the absence of Ae2 activity. Taken together, these results show that cAMP synthesis is increased in Ae2a,b–/– cells, resulting in stimulated cAMP secretion. Creb, pCreb, and Icer1 Expression in Ae2+/+ versus Ae2a,b–/– Fibroblasts—The data presented so far suggest that Ae2-deficient fibroblasts are capable of maintaining normal steady state intracellular cAMP levels by secreting the excess into the extracellular medium (Fig. 3A). However, it is not clear whether this could prevent the activation of cAMP downstream targets, such as the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), especially if the source of cAMP production is localized to subcellular compartments or discrete microdomains. Immunoblots against Creb, a well known target of PKA (31Mayr B. Montminy M. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 2: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2048) Google Scholar), and its Ser133 phosphorylated form (pCreb) show, respectively, a 48% and a 70% increased staining of nuclear fractions from Ae2a,b–/– fibroblasts (Fig. 4A), a good indication of PKA activation. To evaluate the effectiveness of Creb phosphorylation in Ae2a,b–/– cells, we quantified mRNA levels of Icer1, a truncated form of the cAMP response element modulator protein (Crem) transcript, which translates into a potent transcriptional repressor induced by pCreb and involved in the feedback attenuation of pCreb activity through nonproductive binding to CRE sites (32Molina C.A. Foulkes N.S. Lalli E. Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1993; 75: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Besides its more general role in feedback regulation, Icer1 is involved in a number of physiological processes that require precise transient activation of cAMP signaling, such as spermatogenesis and circadian protein expression, by effectively suppressing waves of gene activation generated by pCreb (33Foulkes N.S. Whitmore D. Sassone-Corsi P. Biol. Cell. 1997; 89: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 34Don J. Stelzer G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 187: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Fig. 4B shows that Icer1 mRNA concentration is 6-fold higher in Ae2a,b–/– fibroblasts compared with wild type cells at pHo 7.4. In addition, Icer1 shows a pH-dependent pattern of expression in wild type cells, where it is significantly induced upon medium alkalization (Fig. 4B). A similar tendency is observed in knockout fibroblasts, but Icer1 mRNA expression remains significantly higher than controls under all experimental conditions (Fig. 4B). Collectively, these results suggest that known targets of cAMP signaling via PKA are activated in Ae2-deficient cells and may play an important role in regulating pH-dependent gene expression in murine fibroblasts. Kinetics of Icer1, Crem, and c-Fos mRNA Expression in Response to Forskolin—Based on the increase in cAMP production and the strong induction of Icer1 mRNA in Ae2a,b–/– fibroblasts, we hypothesized that the activation of gene transcription through the cAMP-PKA-Creb pathway could be more widely affected in these cells. To test this hypothesis, we followed the expression of Icer1, Crem, and c-Fos (a prominent target of pCreb)"
https://openalex.org/W2071929839,"The site-specific recombinase integrase encoded by bacteriophage lambda promotes integration and excision of the viral chromosome into and out of its Escherichia coli host chromosome through a Holliday junction recombination intermediate. This intermediate contains an integrase tetramer bound via its catalytic carboxyl-terminal domains to the four ""core-type"" sites of the Holliday junction DNA and via its amino-terminal domains to distal ""arm-type"" sites. The two classes of integrase binding sites are brought into close proximity by an ensemble of accessory proteins that bind and bend the intervening DNA. We have used a biotin interference assay that probes the requirement for major groove protein binding at specified DNA loci in conjunction with DNA protection, gel mobility shift, and genetic experiments to test several predictions of the models derived from the x-ray crystal structures of minimized and symmetrized surrogates of recombination intermediates lacking the accessory proteins and their cognate DNA targets. Our data do not support the predictions of ""non-canonical"" DNA targets for the N-domain of integrase, and they indicate that the complexes used for x-ray crystallography are more appropriate for modeling excisive rather than integrative recombination intermediates. We suggest that the difference in the asymmetric interaction profiles of the N-domains and arm-type sites in integrative versus excisive recombinogenic complexes reflects the regulation of recombination, whereas the asymmetry of these patterns within each reaction contributes to directionality."
https://openalex.org/W2008923242,"While the adaptor SKAP-55 mediates LFA-1 adhesion on T-cells, it is not known whether the adaptor regulates other aspects of signaling. SKAP-55 could potentially act as a node to coordinate the modulation of adhesion with downstream signaling. In this regard, the GTPase p21ras and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway play central roles in T-cell function. In this study, we report that SKAP-55 has opposing effects on adhesion and the activation of the p21ras -ERK pathway in T-cells. SKAP-55 deficient primary T-cells showed a defect in LFA-1 adhesion concurrent with the hyper-activation of the ERK pathway relative to wild-type cells. RNAi knock down (KD) of SKAP-55 in T-cell lines also showed an increase in p21ras activation, while over-expression of SKAP-55 inhibited activation of ERK and its transcriptional target ELK. Three observations implicated the p21ras activating exchange factor RasGRP1 in the process. Firstly, SKAP-55 bound to RasGRP1 via its C-terminus, while secondly, the loss of binding abrogated SKAP-55 inhibition of ERK and ELK activation. Thirdly, SKAP-55−/− primary T-cells showed an increased presence of RasGRP1 in the trans-Golgi network (TGN) following TCR activation, the site where p21ras becomes activated. Our findings indicate that SKAP-55 has a dual role in regulating p21ras-ERK pathway via RasGRP1, as a possible mechanism to restrict activation during T-cell adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W2063179017,"The activation of D-tyrosine by tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase has been investigated using single and multiple turnover kinetic methods. In the presence of saturating concentrations of D-tyrosine, the activation reaction displays sigmoidal kinetics with respect to ATP concentration under single turnover conditions. In contrast, when the kinetics for the activation reaction are monitored using a steady-state (multiple turnover) pyrophosphate exchange assay, Michaelis-Menten kinetics are observed. Previous investigations indicated that activation of l-tyrosine by the K233A variant of Bacillus stearothermophilus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase displays sigmoidal kinetics similar to those observed for activation of d-tyrosine by the wild-type enzyme. Kinetic analyses indicate that the sigmoidal behavior of the d-tyrosine activation reaction is not enhanced when Lys-233 is replaced by alanine. This supports the hypothesis that the mechanistic basis for the sigmoidal behavior is the same for both d-tyrosine activation by wild-type tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase and activation of l-tyrosine by the K233A variant. The observed sigmoidal behavior presents a paradox, as tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase displays an extreme form of negative cooperativity, known as ""half-of-the-sites reactivity,"" with respect to tyrosine binding and tyrosyl-adenylate formation. We propose that the binding of D-tyrosine weakens the affinity with which ATP binds to the functional subunit in tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase. This allows ATP to bind initially to the nonfunctional subunit, inducing a conformational change in the enzyme that enhances the affinity of the functional subunit for ATP. The observation that sigmoidal kinetics are observed only under single turnover conditions suggests that this conformational change is stable over multiple rounds of catalysis."
https://openalex.org/W2104523928,"This report describes the identification and purification of a novel mismatch repair stimulatory factor from HeLa cell extracts. This activity copurifies with a proliferating cell nuclear antigen-dependent 5 ′ → 3 ′ DNA excision activity during several purification steps but is resolved from the excision activity during gel filtration chromatography using Sephacryl S-300. After purification to near homogeneity, the stimulatory factor is associated with three polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of 68, 36, and 30 kDa. Peptide sequencing analysis by tandem mass spectrometry identified the stimulatory factor as the heterotrimeric regulatory factor X (RFX) complex, which regulates transcription of the class II major histocompatibility complex by facilitating histone acetylation and is defective in the human hereditary immunodeficiency syndrome called bare lymphocyte syndrome. This conclusion was confirmed by the facts that purified recombinant RFX stimulates mismatch repair in an in vitro reconstituted mismatch repair system and that depletion of RFX from nuclear extracts or RFX knockdown in cells reduces mismatch repair activity.

MutS, MutL, and MutH recognize mismatches and incise the newly synthesized unmethylated DNA strand (initiation). One of four exonucleases (Exo1, Exo VII, Exo X, and RecJ) carries out mismatch removal via 5′ or 3′ excision from the DNA strand break in conjunction with UvrD helicase. Finally, DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, single-strand DNA-binding protein, and DNA ligase together carry out repair DNA synthesis and DNA ligation (for reviews see Refs. 1Li G.M.

The eukaryotic MMR pathway resembles E. coli MMR, uses a similar repair mechanism, and is carried out by a similar group of protein factors. For example, both eukaryotic and bacterial MMR are strand-specific, bi-directional, and nick-directed, and eukaryotic MutS- and MutL-like activities are highly homologous to their bacterial counterparts. Human MMR has been successfully reconstituted with purified proteins (6Constantin N. Dzantiev L. Kadyrov F.A. Modrich P. J. Biol.

Human MMR activities that play roles similar to those of E. coli MutH and helicase II have not yet been identified. It is clear that human MMR is more complex than E. coli MMR. Although redundancy is evident for several components in the eukaryotic MMR pathway, EXO1 is to date the only nuclease known to be involved in eukaryotic MMR.

Biol. 2001; 21: 5142-5155Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 9Wei K. Clark A.B. Wong E. Kane M.F. Mazur D.J. Parris T. Kolas N.K. Russell R. Hou Jr., H. Kneitz B. Yang G. Kunkel T.A. Kolodner R.D. Cohen P.E. Edelmann W. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar), it seems likely that additional nucleases that play a role in MMR in eukaryotic cells remain to be identified. Our previous studies reported partial purification of a PCNA-dependent 5′ → 3′ DNA excision activity from HeLa nuclear extracts (10Guo S. Presnell S.R. Yuan F. Zhang Y. Gu L. Li G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16912-16917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Here, we report that this 5′ → 3′ DNA excision activity resolves into two fractions during purification, one of which is identical to regulatory factor X (RFX), a heterotrimer that regulates transcription of the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHCII) and is defective in the human hereditary immunodeficiency syndrome bare lymphocyte syndrome (BLS) (11DeSandro A.

Immunol. 2001; 19: 331-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The significance of these data for understanding eukaryotic MMR is discussed. DNA Substrates and Mismatch Excision Assay—DNA heteroduplexes used in this study contained a single G-T mismatch and a strand break 5′ to the mismatch (see Fig. 1). The 5′-nicked substrates were prepared by hybridizing single-stranded f1MR phage to Sau96I-linearized double-stranded DNA of another phage as described previously (14Holmes Jr., J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). The mismatch occurs within the overlapping recognition sites for restriction endonucleases HindIII and XhoI, immediately 5′ to the NheI cleavage site (10Guo S. Presnell S.R. Yuan F. Zhang Y. Gu L. Li G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16912-16917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The extent of excision was monitored by NheI and BspDI digestion. Unless otherwise indicated, mismatch excision assays contained 100 ng (24 fmol) of heteroduplex DNA, 26 nm MutSα,67 nm PCNA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1.5 mm ATP. Samples to be assayed were added in a volume of 2–4 μl. The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, and DNA was isolated by phenol extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. The reaction products were digested with NheI and BspDI, analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized by UV illumination. Nuclear Extract Preparation and Protein Purification—HeLa S3 cells were either purchased from the National Cell Culture Center (Minneapolis, MN) or cultured in our own laboratory. The nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (14Holmes Jr., J. Clark S. Modrich P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5837-5841Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Unless otherwise indicated, fractionation and chromatography were performed at 4 °C. HeLa cell nuclear extract (∼1.0 g of total proteins) was adjusted to 65% saturation with ammonium sulfate, and the precipitate was collected by centrifugation. The precipitate was resuspended in and dialyzed against buffer A (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) containing 0.1 m KCl. The clarified supernatant was loaded onto a phosphocellulose P11 column (7.1 cm2 × 15 cm) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.1 m KCl. The column was washed with five column volumes of buffer A containing 0.35 m KCl. The 5′ nick-directed excision activity was eluted with 0.45 m KCl in buffer A. The pooled P11 fractions were desalted to 0.1 m KCl in buffer A through five connected 5-ml HiTrap desalting columns (GE Healthcare) and loaded onto a 40 ml (4 cm2 × 10 cm) Q Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in buffer A with 0.1 m KCl. The Q Sepharose column was developed with a linear gradient of 0.1–0.5 m KCl in buffer A. The excision activity eluted at 0.23–0.31 m KCl. Active fractions were pooled, desalted to 0.2 m KCl, and loaded onto a 20-ml (2.5 cm2 × 8 cm) Bio-Rex 70 (Bio-Rad). The column was developed with a linear gradient of 0.2–0.5 m KCl in buffer A. Active fractions eluted from 0.37 to 0.42 m KCl were pooled and concentrated to a volume of 2 ml using an Amicon Ultra-4 filtration device (Millipore). The concentrated sample was loaded onto a 120-ml (1.2 cm2 × 100 cm) Sephacryl S-300 (S-300) gel filtration column equilibrated in buffer A with 0.1 m KCl. The nuclease activity and excision stimulatory factor did not coelute during this chromatography step. The peak of the excision stimulatory factor was identified by conducting excision assays in the presence of pooled nuclease activity from the S-300 column. Active stimulatory factor fractions were pooled and loaded onto a 10-ml (1.5 cm2 × 6.7 cm) hydroxyapatite (HAP) column equilibrated with a phosphate buffer containing 0.025 m potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.1 m KCl, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin. The HAP column was washed extensively with the same buffer and eluted with a linear gradient of potassium phosphate (0.025–0.5 m). The stimulatory activity eluted at ∼0.08 M potassium phosphate. Active fractions were pooled, desalted into to buffer A containing 0.05 m KCl, and loaded onto a 1-ml Mono S column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.05 m KCl. The Mono S column was developed with a linear gradient from 0.05 to 0.5 m KCl in buffer A. The activity eluted from 0.3 to 0.4 m KCl. Active fractions were pooled, desalted into buffer B containing 0.2 m KCl, and loaded onto a 5-ml HiTrap heparin column (GE Healthcare), which was developed with a linear gradient from 0.2 to 1.0 m KCl. Active fractions, which eluted at ∼0.4 m KCl, were pooled, desalted into buffer B containing 0.05 m KCl, and loaded onto a 2-ml ssDNA cellulose column (Sigma). The ssDNA cellulose column was developed with a linear gradient of 0.05–0.5 m KCl in buffer B. Active fractions, which eluted at ∼0.2 m KCl, were pooled and loaded onto a 2-ml HAP column equilibrated with 0.08 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 m KCl. The excision stimulatory factor did not bind to the column under these conditions. Therefore, the unbound fraction was collected and stored for further studies and analysis. Mass Spectrometry for Protein Identification—An aliquot of the excision stimulatory factor from HAP flow-through was separated by 10% SDS-PAGE (see Fig. 2B). The 68-, 36-, and 30-kDa bands were excised from the gel and analyzed by mass spectrometry as described previously (15Wang D. Park J.S. Chu J.S. Krakowski A. Luo K. Chen D.J. Li S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 43725-43734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Briefly, each excised gel slice was incubated with trypsin at 37 °C. The tryptic peptides were extracted and analyzed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry using a Q-TOF API US mass spectrometer interfaced with a capillary liquid chromatography system (Waters Corp.). The eluate was directed to the electrospray source with a PicoTip emitter (New Objectives). Mass spectra were processed using MassLynx 4.0 software, and proteins were identified using Protein Global Server 1.0/2.0 software. Protein species were identified and confirmed by exporting tandem mass spectrometry peak lists exported from MassLynx to Mascot. Peptide sequences were queried against the NCBI nonredundant protein data base. Protein modifications considered include cysteine carbamidomethylation (fixed), N-terminal acetylation, N-terminal Gln to pyroGlu, methionine oxidation, and serine, threonine, and tyrosine phosphorylation. Antibody, Antibody Depletion, and Western Blot—An antibody to EXO1 was generated by Genemed Synthesis (San Antonio, TX), using 1.0 mg of recombinant human EXO1 protein expressed and purified from insect cells as described (7Zhang Y. Yuan F. Presnell S.R. Tian K. Gao Y. Tomkinson A.E. Gu L. Li G.M. Cell. 2005; 122: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Antibody depletion experiments were performed at 0–4 °C. Nuclear extract (400 μg) was incubated with 5 μl of anti-RFX5 antibody (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX) for 30 min on ice. Prewashed protein A-Sepharose (15 μl) (Roche Applied Science) was added, and the reaction was incubated for 1 h and centrifuged at 350 × g for 2 min. The clarified supernatant was used in mismatch excision assays. Control samples were treated as above with a nonspecific antibody. Western blots were performed according to standard procedures using the ECL Plus Western blot kit (Amersham Biosciences). Expression and Purification of Recombinant RFX—cDNAs encoding RFX5, RFXAP, and RFXANK were kindly provided by Matija Peterlin (University of California, San Francisco). cDNAs were amplified by PCR and subcloned into pFastBac1 transfer vector (Invitrogen). Baculovirus was prepared, and recombinant proteins were expressed using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen) as described (7Zhang Y. Yuan F. Presnell S.R. Tian K. Gao Y. Tomkinson A.E. Gu L. Li G.M. Cell. 2005; 122: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Briefly, upon expression of the recombinant protein in insect cells, the cells were homogenized using a Dounce homogenizer, and cell extracts were purified using Q Sepharose, HAP, Mono S, and Superdex 200 gel filtration column chromatography. Purified recombinant RFX was stored in buffer B containing 0.15 m KCl in aliquots at –80 °C. RFX5 Knockdown by shRNA—HeLa cells were transfected with a pmH1P-bsd-based construct (16Carmell M.A. Zhang L. Conklin D.S. Hannon G.J. Rosenquist T.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 91-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar), which targets position 1785–1803 (AGGAGCATGTGCTTCAAAG) of RFX5. Transfected cells were selected with 40 mg/ml of blasticidin (Invitrogen). Individual blasticidin-resistant clones were selected for analysis of RFX expression by Western blot. Clones with significantly reduced expression of RFX5 were selected, characterized further, and used in this study. Identification of a Novel Factor That Stimulates Mismatch-provoked Excision—The biochemical mechanism of human MMR is only partly understood at present. Key protein factors involved in this pathway include MutSα, MutSβ, MutLα, PCNA, EXO1, RPA, replication factor C, HMGB1, DNA polymerase δ, and ligase I (1Li G.M. Cell Res. 2008; 18: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar, 6Constantin N. Dzantiev L. Kadyrov F.A. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39752-39761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 7Zhang Y. Yuan F. Presnell S.R. Tian K. Gao Y. Tomkinson A.E. Gu L. Li G.M.

Cell. 2004; 15: 31-41Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that additional as yet unidentified protein factors, including one or more exonucleases, play significant roles in human MMR, and additional studies are needed to identify and characterize these protein factors. Our previous studies identified an activity in HeLa cell nuclear extracts that supports 5′ nick-directed, mismatch-provoked DNA excision (10Guo S. Presnell S.R. Yuan F. Zhang Y. Gu L. Li G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16912-16917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In vitro biochemical studies demonstrated that the excision activity is PCNA-dependent, 5′ nick-specific, and heteroduplex-specific (10Guo S. Presnell S.R. Yuan F. Zhang Y. Gu L. Li G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16912-16917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Here, a series of chromatographic steps were used to purify this novel MMR excision factor (see “Experimental Procedures”). The excision activity was monitored during purification by virtue of its ability to conduct 5′-directed mismatch excision in the presence of MutSα and PCNA using a functional assay, which measures the formation of a ssDNA gap during mismatch-provoked excision. The ssDNA gap confers resistance to restriction endonuclease NheI (Fig. 1A), producing a slow moving DNA product (see arrows in Fig. 1, B and C). The excision activity was recovered as a single peak of activity during phosphocellulose P-11, Q-Sepharose (Fig. 1B), and Bio-Rex 70 chromatography (data not shown). However, a dramatic loss in activity was observed after Sepharose S-300 (S-300) gel filtration chromatography. As shown in Fig. 1C (left panel), the mismatch-provoked excision activity was detected in fractions 51–57 of the S-300 column; however, the amount of activity detected in these fractions was reproducibly ≈5-fold lower than the amount of activity detected after Q Sepharose chromatography (Fig. 1, compare B, right panel, with C). This result suggests that the excision activity might include multiple components that partially or completely dissociate during gel filtration. This possibility was tested by reassaying individual fractions of the S-300 column for mismatch-provoked excision in the presence of the most active (i.e. peak) S-300 fraction (fraction 53). The results showed that fractions 42–48 significantly stimulated product formation (Fig. 1C, right panel), with fraction 42 producing the greatest stimulatory effect (note that fraction 42 is the first fraction after the void volume of the gel filtration column). These results suggest that (i) the 5′ directed mismatch excision activity includes an excision activity (fractions 51–56) and a dissociable stimulatory factor (fractions 42–48) and (ii) the stimulating factor is a high molecular weight protein or protein complex. The Excision Stimulatory Factor Is RFX—The stimulatory factor was further purified by chromatography on HAP, MonoS, heparin, and ssDNA cellulose (see “Experimental Procedures”), and column fractions were analyzed for mismatch-provoked excision activity and protein composition by SDS-PAGE. The results from the ssDNA cellulose column are shown in Fig. 2A. During ssDNA cellulose chromatography, the excision-stimulatory activity correlated with multiple major protein bands. However, protein analysis of Mono S and other chromatography steps indicated that the stimulatory factor did not include polypeptides larger than 83 kDa (supplemental Fig. S1). Therefore, we conclude that the stimulatory factor is likely to include three major polypeptides of <83 kDa, which are 68, 36, and 30 kDa in size (Fig. 2, arrows, and supplemental Fig. S1). This conclusion is supported by results of HAP chromatography (Fig. 2B). When the active fractions (fractions 51–56) from the ssDNA cellulose column were pooled and applied to a HAP column, the stimulatory activity, which did not bind to the HAP column, again copurified with polypeptides 68, 36, and 30 kDa in size (Fig. 2B, arrows). To confirm the identity of these three polypeptides, they were excised from the protein gel, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. Peptide sequences produced by tandem mass spectrometry analysis were queried against the nonredundant protein data base using two search algorithms: ProteinLynx and Mascot. The results showed that peptides from all three polypeptides produced high confidence hits in the protein data base (Table 1 and supplemental Table S1). Notably, peptides from all three proteins had Mascot scores of >400, and both methods definitively proved that the three polypeptides that copurify with the mismatch-provoked excision stimulatory factor are the subunits of RFX: RFX5 (68 kDa), RFXAP (36 kDa), and RFXANK (30 kDa). In addition, the electrophoretic mobility of the major bands associated with the stimulatory factor during SDS-PAGE are consistent with the predicted molecular weight of RFX subunits (Fig. 2), and the stimulatory activity copurifies with a polypeptide that cross-reacts with antibody to RFX5 (data not shown and supplemental Fig. S2). A recent study by Garvie et al. (18Garvie C.W. Stagno J.R. Reid S. Singh A. Harrington E. Boss J.M. Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 1597-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) has shown that RFX is composed of a 2:1:1 complex of RFX5 ·RFXAP ·RFXANK, which can further associate with a dimmer of RFX5 to form a 4:1:1 large complex. This explains why the stimulatory factor elutes immediately after the void volume of the S300 column and why the 68-kDa (RFX5) band is much abundant than the other two subunits (Figs. 2 and 3A).TABLE 1Identification of RFX subunits by mass spectrometryGel bandProtein nameSwiss-Prot accession numberMolecular massNumber of peptide sequencedSequence coverageMascot scorekDa%68 kDaRFX5P4838265.33667130236 kDaRFXAPO0028728.262944430 kDaRFXANKO1459328.1942503 Open table in a new tab Both Native and Recombinant RFX Facilitate EXO1-catalyzed Mismatch Excision—EXO1, a 5′ → 3′ exonuclease, is the only nuclease implicated in mammalian MMR (19Genschel J.

Therefore, the excision activity was tested for immunoreactivity to antibody to full-length recombinant EXO1 (see “Experimental Procedures”). This experiment suggests that EXO1 is a component of the partially purified mismatch excision activity (data not shown and supplemental Fig. S2). Interestingly, EXO1 and RFX coeluted during early purification steps, and the overlap between the peaks of EXO1 and RFX protein correlated with the peak of excision activity (supplemental Fig. S2). This finding suggests that RFX and EXO1 could be two critical components of a reconstituted/defined in vitro eukaryotic MMR assay, as tested below. Fig. 3B demonstrates a reconstituted in vitro assay for quantifying mismatch-provoked 5′ → 3′ excision in the presence of purified human MutSα, MutLα, EXO1, RPA, and HMGB1 (7Zhang Y. Yuan F. Presnell S.R. Tian K. Gao Y. Tomkinson A.E. Gu L. Li G.M. Cell. 2005; 122: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Note that in these experiments, the amount of EXO1 was somewhat suboptimal, compared with previously published experiments (7Zhang Y. Yuan F. Presnell S.R. Tian K. Gao Y. Tomkinson A.E. Gu L. Li G.M. Cell. 2005; 122: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). Thus, minimal excision occurred in the absence of the stimulatory factor (Fig. 3B, lane 1) or recombinant RFX (Fig. 3B, lane 3). However, the stimulatory factor (Fig. 3B, lane 2) or recombinant RFX (Fig. 3B, lanes 4 and 5) strongly stimulated the excision reaction. It is interesting to note that native RFX is more active than recombinant RFX in this reaction. This could be due to phosphorylation of native RFX5, because we have identified its phosphorylation at Ser347, Ser185, and Thr614 by mass spectrometry (data not shown). Nevertheless, both proteins stimulate EXO1-catalyzed excision significantly. These data strongly support the conclusion that the excision stimulatory factor is RFX. RFX Depletion Inhibits MMR Activity—The role of RFX in mismatch-provoked excision was also examined by depleting or knocking down RFX in HeLa cells. RFX depletion using antibody to RFX5 specifically depleted RFX5 protein by more than 90% (Fig. 4A) and also inhibited mismatch-provoked excision (Fig. 4C, lane 2); similar results were observed with shRNA-mediated RFX knockdown (Fig. 4, B and D); however, control antibody (against nucleotide excision repair enzyme XPG) or phosphate-buffered saline buffer did not deplete RFX protein (Fig. 4A) or inhibit excision activity (Fig. 4C). The addition of recombinant RFX to the RFX5-depleted extract reversed the effect of antibody depletion (Fig. 4C, lanes 3 and 4) as well as shRNA knockdown, supporting a role for RFX in MMR. Because defects in MMR causes genome-wide instability at DNA level, including microsatellite instability, subclones were obtained from an RFX5-shRNA knockdown clone and analyzed for microsatellite instability employing three commonly used microsatellite markers, BAT25, BAT26, and D2S123. Although polymorphic changes were not identified in BAT26 and D2S123 (data not shown), instability (one nucleotide contraction) was indeed detected in a subclone of the knockdown cells when BAT25 was analyzed (Fig. 5, clone 14 in the right panel). Our results shown here strongly support a role for RFX in MMR. However, it is also noted that depletion of RFX does not completely inhibit MMR (Fig. 4) and only results in a partial mutator phenotype (Fig. 5). These phenomena could be due to the fact that RFX was not completely depleted in the cells/extracts or that RFX is a facilitating factor rather than an essential component in MMR. This study identifies RFX as a novel factor that stimulates 5′ → 3′ mismatch-provoked excision in vitro. Two sources of RFX were used in this study: native RFX purified from HeLa cells and recombinant human RFX, overexpressed and purified from insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. Importantly, both RFX preparations stimulated mismatch-provoked excision in crude HeLa nuclear extracts or in a reconstituted system. These facts validate the results of this study. RFX plays a well established role in regulating expression of genes encoding the human class II major histocompatibility complex (MHCII) (11DeSandro A. Nagarajan U.M. Boss J.M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 65: 279-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 12Nagarajan U.M. Louis-Plence P. DeSandro A. Nilsen R. Bushey A. Boss J.M. Immunity. 1999; 10: 153-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 13Reith W. Mach B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 331-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). Defects in any RFX subunit cause the BLS, a severe immunodeficiency disorder characterized by a lack of MHCII, absence of cellular and humoral T-cell immune response to foreign antigens, and impaired antibody productions, leading to extreme susceptibility to viral, bacterial, and fungal infections. As a result, these patients usually fail to reach puberty (22Elhasid R. Etzioni A. Blood Rev. 1996; 10: 242-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The in vitro data presented here suggest a possible role for RFX in MMR. These results pose an obvious and important question: are BLS patients defective in MMR? Although a definitive answer to the question is unknown, our preliminary studies in cell lines seem to support a role for RFX in MMR in vivo. First, HeLa cells with RFX5 knockdown by RNAi exhibited microsatellite instability (Fig. 5), an indicator of MMR deficiency (reviewed in Ref. 1Li G.M. Cell Res. 2008; 18: 85-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). Second, a B-lymphocyte cell line (a gift from Jeremy Boss, Emory University) derived from an RFX5-deficient BLS patient is defective in strand-specific MMR. 4L. Gu and G.-M. Li, unpublished observations. However, understanding whether or not the BLS patients are defective in MMR requires a direct investigation of BLS patients for MMR capability. The specificity and mechanism of how RFX stimulates MMR are not yet clear. As a transcription factor, RFX regulates MHCII gene expression by binding to the promoter regions (11DeSandro A. Nagarajan U.M. Boss J.M. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1999; 65: 279-286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 13Reith W. Mach B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2001; 19: 331-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). The DNA binding activity of RFX may allow it to interact with MMR components and facilitate mismatch excision; these components may include MutSα, MutLα, PCNA, replication factor C, and EXO1. Recent studies have revealed that RFX, particularly the RFXANK subunit, is required for conquering the repressive influence of chromatin for MHCII gene expression by interacting with nucleosomes and/or by recruiting chromatin-remodeling or -modifying factors (23Masternak K. Peyraud N. Krawczyk M. Barras E. Reith W. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 24Mudhasani R. Fontes J.D. Mol. Immunol. 2005; 42: 673-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The interactions between RFX and chromatin-remodeling or -modifying factors have been shown to induce histone hyperacetylation of a broad chromatin domain at RFX target genes, and it is this change in chromatin structure that allows the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the target gene loci for transcription (23Masternak K. Peyraud N. Krawczyk M. Barras E. Reith W. Nat. Immunol. 2003; 4: 132-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Like transcription, chromatin remodeling may be also required for DNA repair. Despite the fact that the human MMR reaction has recently been reconstituted in vitro using a naked mismatched DNA and purified proteins (6Constantin N. Dzantiev L. Kadyrov F.A. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39752-39761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 7Zhang Y. Yuan F. Presnell S.R. Tian K. Gao Y. Tomkinson A.E. Gu L. Li G.M. Cell. 2005; 122: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), it is anticipated that the protein components adequate for naked DNA heteroduplexes are unlikely sufficient for MMR at the chromatin level. The chromatin remodeling function of RFX may facilitate MMR in vivo, where DNA is wrapped with histone proteins in nucleosomes. Further studies are required to explore this possibility and to determine how RFX stimulates mismatch-provoked excision in vitro. This study shows that the human mismatch-provoked excision activity separates into two components during Sephacryl S-300 gel filtration chromatography (Fig. 1), one of which is a 5′ → 3′ exonuclease. The identity of the 5′ → 3′ exonuclease was established here using immunological methods. In particular, Western blot analysis showed that the 5′ → 3′ exonuclease copurifies with a polypeptide that is recognized by a highly specific antibody to full-length EXO1 (supplemental Fig. S2 and data not shown). Because mismatch-provoked excision activity is also observed in a reconstituted system using purified EXO1, we conclude that the EXO1 is a critical component of the RFX-stimulated mismatch-provoked excision activity characterized in this study. These findings should stimulate additional molecular and mechanistic studies on the roles of RFX and EXO1 in human MMR. EXO1 has been shown to be involved in 3′-directed mismatch repair (19Genschel J. Bazemore L.R. Modrich P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 13302-13311Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). It is worth mentioning that our previous studies failed to detect the presence of EXO1 and 3′-directed mismatch-provoked excision in the RFX-containing partially purified excision activity (10Guo S. Presnell S.R. Yuan F. Zhang Y. Gu L. Li G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 16912-16917Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We realize now that the former was due to the use of a less specific antibody to a fragment of EXO1, and the latter (i.e. no 3′-directed excision) was due to the fact that the partially purified excision activity does not contain MutLα (data not shown), whose endonuclease activity is essential for 3′-directed MMR by EXO1 (25Kadyrov F.A.

https://openalex.org/W2013973349,"In previous reports we proposed a new genus for Rhabdoviridae and described neurotropic preference and gross neuropathology in newborn albino Swiss mice after Curionopolis and Itacaiunas infections. In the present report a time-course study of experimental encephalitis induced by Itacaiunas and Curionopolis virus was conducted both in vivo and in vitro to investigate cellular targets and the sequence of neuroinvasion. We also investigate, after intranasal inoculation, clinical signs, histopathology and apoptosis in correlation with viral immunolabeling at different time points. Curionopolis and Itacaiunas viral antigens were first detected in the parenchyma of olfactory pathways at 2 and 3 days post-inoculation (dpi) and the first clinical signs were observed at 4 and 8 dpi, respectively. After Curionopolis infection, the mortality rate was 100% between 5 and 6 dpi, and 35% between 8 and 15 dpi after Itacaiunas infection. We identified CNS mice cell types both in vivo and in vitro and the temporal sequence of neuroanatomical olfactory areas infected by Itacaiunas and Curionopolis virus. Distinct virulences were reflected in the neuropathological changes including TUNEL immunolabeling and cytopathic effects, more intense and precocious after intracerebral or in vitro inoculations of Curionopolis than after Itacaiunas virus. In vitro studies revealed neuronal but not astrocyte or microglial cytopathic effects at 2 dpi, with monolayer destruction occurring at 5 and 7 dpi with Curionopolis and Itacaiunas virus, respectively. Ultrastructural changes included virus budding associated with interstitial and perivascular edema, endothelial hypertrophy, a reduced and/or collapsed small vessel luminal area, thickening of the capillary basement membrane, and presence of phagocytosed apoptotic bodies. Glial cells with viral budding similar to oligodendrocytes were infected with Itacaiunas virus but not with Curionopolis virus. Thus, Curionopolis and Itacaiunas viruses share many pathological and clinical features present in other rhabdoviruses but distinct virulence and glial targets in newborn albino Swiss mice brain."
