https://openalex.org/W1984288177,"Signals released by the Spemann organizer of the amphibian gastrula can directly induce neural tissue from ectoderm and can dorsalize ventral mesoderm to form muscle. The secreted polypeptide noggin mimics these activities and is expressed at the appropriate time and place to participate in the organizer signal. Neural induction and mesoderm dorsalization are antagonized by bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), which induce epidermis and ventral mesoderm instead. Here we report that noggin protein binds BMP4 with high affinity and can abolish BMP4 activity by blocking binding to cognate cell-surface receptors. These data suggest that noggin secreted by the organizer patterns the embryo by interrupting BMP signaling."

https://openalex.org/W2025019677,"Chordin (Chd) is an abundant protein secreted by Spemann organizer tissue during gastrulation. Chd antagonizes signaling by mature bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) by blocking binding to their receptors. Recombinant Xenopus Chd binds to BMP-4 with high affinity (KD 3 × 10−10 M), binding specifically to BMPs but not to activin or TGF-β1. Chd protein is able to dorsalize mesoderm and to neuralize ectoderm in Xenopus gastrula explants at 1 nM. We propose that the noncell-autonomous effects of Spemann's organizer on dorsoventral patterning are executed in part by diffusible signals that directly bind to and neutralize ventral BMPs during gastrulation."

https://openalex.org/W1968104539,"alpha(1,3)Fucosylated oligosaccharides represent components of leukocyte counterreceptors for E- and P-selectins and of L-selectin ligands expressed by lymph node high endothelial venules (HEV). The identity of the alpha(1,3)fucosyltransferase(s) required for their expression has been uncertain, as has a requirement for alpha(1,3)fucosylation in HEV L-selectin ligand activity. We demonstrate here that mice deficient in alpha(1,3) fucosyltransferase Fuc-TVII exhibit a leukocyte adhesion deficiency characterized by absent leukocyte E- and P-selectin ligand activity and deficient HEV L-selectin ligand activity. Selectin ligand deficiency is distinguished by blood leukocytosis, impaired leukocyte extravasation in inflammation, and faulty lymphocyte homing. These observations demonstrate an essential role for Fuc-TVII in E-, P-, and L-selectin ligand biosynthesis and imply that this locus can control leukocyte trafficking in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W2026460094,"TGFβ1 has been implicated in cell cycle control and carcinogenesis. To address the exact function of TGFβ1 in skin carcinogenesis in vivo, mice with TGFβ1 expression targeted to keratinocytes were subjected to long-term chemical carcinogenesis treatment. TGFβ1 showed biphasic action during multistage skin carcinogenesis, acting early as a tumor suppressor but later enhancing the malignant phenotype. The transgenics were more resistant to induction of benign skin tumors than controls, but the malignant conversion rate was vastly increased. There was also a higher incidence of spindle cell carcinomas, which expressed high levels of endogenous TGFβ3, suggesting that TGFβ1 elicits an epithelial–mesenchymal transition in vivo and that TGFβ3 might be involved in maintenance of the spindle cell phenotype. The action of TGFβ1 in enhancing malignant progression may mimic its proposed function in modulating epithelial cell plasticity during embryonic development."

https://openalex.org/W2156638024,"Vesicular transport to and from the lysosome and late endosome is defective in patients with Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) and in mutant beige (bg) mice. CHS and bg cells have giant, perinuclear vesicles with characteristics of late endosomes and lysosomes that arise from dysregulated homotypic fusion. CHS and bg lysosomes also exhibit compartmental missorting of proteins, such as elastase, glucuronidase and cathepsin G. Lyst, a candidate gene for bg, was identified by direct complementary DNA selection from a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) clone containing a 650-kilobase segment of the bg-critical region on mouse chromosome 13. Lyst is disrupted by a 5-kilobase deletion in bg mice, and Lyst messenger RNA is markedly reduced in bg homozygotes. The homologous human gene, LYST, is highly conserved with mouse Lyst, and contains a frame-shift mutation at nucleotides 117-118 of the coding domain in a CHS patient. Thus bg mice and human CHS patients have homologous disorders associated with Lyst mutations. Lyst encodes a protein with a carboxy-terminal prenylation motif and multiple potential phosphorylation sites. Lyst protein is predicted to form extended helical domains, and has a region of sequence similar to stathmin, a coiled-coil phosphoprotein thought to act as a relay integrating cellular signal response coupling."

https://openalex.org/W2057778600,"Although expression of the Fos family of transcription factors is induced by environmental stimuli that trigger adaptive neuronal response, evidence that Fos family members mediate these responses is lacking. To address this issue, mice were generated with an inactivating mutation in the fosB gene. fosB mutant mice are profoundly deficient in their ability to nurture young animals but are normal with respect to other cognitive and sensory functions. The nurturing defect is likely due to the absence of FosB in the preoptic area, a region of the hypothalamus that is critical for nurturing. These observations suggest that a transcription factor controls a complex behavior by regulating a specific neuronal circuit and indicate that nurturing in mammals has a genetic component."

https://openalex.org/W2105350292,"Typified by rapid degeneration of sensory neurons, dystonia musculorum mice have a defective BPAG1 gene, known to be expressed in epidermis. We report a neuronal splice form, BPAG1n, which localizes to sensory axons. Both isoforms have a coiled-coil rod, followed by a carboxy domain that associates with intermediate filaments. However, the amino terminus of BPAG1n differs from BPAG1e in that it contains a functional actin-binding domain. In transfected cells, BPAG1n coaligns neurofilaments and microfilaments, establishing this as a cytoskeletal protein interconnecting actin and intermediate filament cytoskeletons. In BPAG1 null mice, axonal architecture is markedly perturbed, consistent with a failure to tether neurofilaments to the actin cytoskeleton and underscoring the physiological relevance of this protein."
https://openalex.org/W1973622904,"We describe the complete β-tubulin folding pathway. Folding intermediates produced via ATP–dependent interaction with cytosolic chaperonin undergo a sequence of interactions with four proteins (cofactors A, D, E, and C). The postchaperonin steps in the reaction cascade do not depend on ATP or GTP hydrolysis, although GTP plays a structural role in tubulin folding. Cofactors A and D function by capturing and stabilizing β-tubulin in a quasi-native conformation. Cofactor E binds to the cofactor D–β-tubulin complex; interaction with cofactor C then causes the release of β-tubulin polypeptides that are committed to the native state. Sequence analysis identifies yeast homologs of cofactors D (cin1) and E (pac2), characterized by mutations that affect microtubule function."

https://openalex.org/W2002561391,"Base-excision DNA repair proteins that target alkylation damage act on a variety of seemingly dissimilar adducts, yet fail to recognize other closely related lesions. The 1.8 A crystal structure of the monofunctional DNA glycosylase AlkA (E. coli 3-methyladenine-DNA glycosylase II) reveals a large hydrophobic cleft unusually rich in aromatic residues. An Asp residue projecting into this cleft is essential for catalysis, and it governs binding specificity for mechanism-based inhibitors. We propose that AlkA recognizes electron-deficient methylated bases through pi-donor/acceptor interactions involving the electron-rich aromatic cleft. Remarkably, AlkA is similar in fold and active site location to the bifunctional glycosylase/lyase endonuclease III, suggesting the two may employ fundamentally related mechanisms for base excision."

https://openalex.org/W2109998847,"The SIR2, SIR3, and SIR4 proteins are required for silencing of transcription at the silent mating type loci and at telomeres in yeast. Using protein affinity chromatography, we show that SIR2, SIR3, and two proteins of 69 and 110 kDa tightly associate with SIR4. Surprisingly, the 110 kDa SIR4-binding protein is identical to UBP3, one of several previously described yeast enzymes that deubiquitinate target proteins. Deletion of the UBP3 gene results in markedly improved silencing of genes inserted either near a telomere or at one of the silent mating type loci, indicating that UBP3 is an inhibitor of silencing. We discuss possible roles for UBP3 in controlling the activity or assembly of the SIR protein complex."

https://openalex.org/W1797186306,"To study the role of glucokinase (GK) in the control of glucose metabolism in the liver, transgenic mice were generated in which GK was overexpressed under control of the P-enolpyruvate carboxykinase gene promoter. Whereas the expression of the GK gene in starved control mice was blocked, this promoter was able to direct the expression of the enzyme to the liver of starved transgenic mice. Furthermore, starved transgenic mice showed levels of GK activity fourfold higher than those of starved control and similar to those of fed control. This activation of GK led to an increase in the intracellular concentration of glucose 6-phosphate, which was also related to an induction of glycogen accumulation. In addition, L-pyruvate kinase (L-PK) activity increased in transgenic mice, which when starved showed similar levels of activity to control fed mice. The induction of L-PK caused an increase in the hepatic lactate concentration. Furthermore, hepatocytes in primary culture from transgenic mice incubated with 20 mM glucose produced levels of lactate threefold higher than controls, but no difference was noted when the hepatocytes from control and transgenic mice were incubated with 2 mM glucose. These results demonstrated in vivo that the activation of GK is a rate-limiting step in the induction of glycolysis and glycogen synthesis. These changes in liver glucose metabolism led to a marked reduction in blood glucose (30%) and insulin (40%) concentrations. Furthermore, transgenic mice showed lower levels of blood glucose after an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test, indicating that GK overexpression caused an increase in blood glucose disposal by the liver. All these findings show the key role of liver GK in the control of whole-body glucose homeostasis.-Ferre, T., Riu, E., Bosch, F., Valera, A. Evidence from transgenic mice that glucokinase is rate limiting for glucose utilization in the liver."

https://openalex.org/W2103108718,"Heterotrimeric G proteins are signal-transducing molecules activated by seven transmembrane domain receptors. In C. elegans, gpb-1 encodes the sole Gβ subunit; therefore, its inactivation should affect all heterotrimeric G protein signaling. When maternal but no zygotic gpb-1 protein (GPB-1) is present, development proceeds until the first larval stage, but these larvae show little muscle activity and die soon after hatching. When, however, the maternal contribution of GPB-1 is also reduced, spindle orientations in early cell divisions are randomized. Cell positions in these embryos are consequently abnormal, and the embryos die with the normal number of cells and well-differentiated but abnormally distributed tissues. These results indicate that maternal G proteins are important for orientation of early cell division axes, possibly by coupling a membrane signal to centrosome position."

https://openalex.org/W2033519208,"The three-dimensional structure of Escherichia coli 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase II, which removes numerous alkylated bases from DNA, was solved at 2.3 A resolution. The enzyme consists of three domains: one alpha + beta fold domain with a similarity to one-half of the eukaryotic TATA box-binding protein, and two all alpha-helical domains similar to those of Escherichia coli endonuclease III with combined N-glycosylase/abasic lyase activity. Mutagenesis and model-building studies suggest that the active site is located in a cleft between the two helical domains and that the enzyme flips the target base out of the DNA duplex into the active-site cleft. The structure of the active site implies broad substrate specificity and simple N-glycosylase activity."
https://openalex.org/W2076291668,"We have developed an in vitro reconstitution system to investigate the role of U5 snRNA in the two catalytic steps of pre-mRNA splicing. The invariant U5 loop 1 is known to interact with exon sequences at the 5′ splice site before the first catalytic step. Remarkably, analysis of U5 mutations in vitro reveals that the first transesterification occurs accurately in the absence of the U5 loop. Therefore this sequence is not an essential component of the spliceosomal active site for the first catalytic step. The second catalytic step, although strongly dependent on the presence of a U5 loop to tether the exon 1 splicing intermediate, is surprisingly tolerant of mutations in the invariant sequence."

https://openalex.org/W2134613767,"The events that take place at the prokaryotic enhancer of the Pu promoter of Pseudomonas putida prior to the engagement of the sigma 54-RNA polymerase (sigma 54-RNAP) have been studied in vitro. ATP hydrolysis by XylR, the cognate regulator of the system, is preceded by the multimerization of XylR at the enhancer, which is itself triggered by the sole allosteric effect of ATP binding to the protein. Since ADP is unable to support multimerization, ATP hydrolysis might be followed by a return to the nonmultimerized state. This notion is supported further by the properties of mutant proteins that seem to be frozen, in either the nonmultimerized or the multimerized state, respectively. These results support a cyclic mechanism of ATP-dependent association/dissociation of XylR at the promoter UAS that precedes any involvement of the polymerase in transcription initiation."
https://openalex.org/W1553169723,"Excessive urea excretion associated with a negative nitrogen balance and massive loss of skeletal muscle mass (cachexia) is a frequent life-threatening complication in malignancies and HIV infection. As these patients have often elevated inter-leukin-6 (IL-6) and abnormally low cystine levels, we have now determined the intracellular levels of glutathione and other cysteine derivatives in the liver and muscle tissue of IL-6-treated or tumor-bearing C57BL/6 mice. IL-6 treatment or inoculation of the MCA-105 fibrosarcoma caused a significant increase in hepatic γ-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase activity and a decrease in the sulfate level, glutamine/urea ratio, and glutamine/glutamate ratio, suggesting that a decrease of the proton generating cysteine catabolism in the liver may increase carbamoyl-phosphate synthesis and urea formation at the expense of net glutamine synthesis. Treatment with cysteine, conversely, caused an increase in sulfate, glutamine/urea ratios, and glutamine/glutamate ratios and may thus be a useful therapeutic tool in clinical medicine. In contrast to the liver, muscle tissue of tumor-bearing mice showed decreased glutathione and increased sulfate levels, suggesting that the cysteine pool may be drained by an increased cysteine catabolism in this tissue. The findings indicate that tumor cachexia is triggered initially by IL-6 and is later sustained by processes driven by an abnormal cysteine metabolism in different organs.—Hack, V., Gross, A., Kinscherf, R., Bockstette, M., Fiers, W., Berke, G., and Dröge, W. Abnormal glutathione and sulfate levels after interleukin 6 treatment and in tumor-induced cachexia. FASEB J. 10, 1219-1226 (1996)"
https://openalex.org/W1750064119,"We recently developed a pig model with naturally occurring hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). To further characterize the biochemical features of high frequency of sudden death affected by this disease, the protein profiles of ventricular tissues were analyzed on normal, HCM, and HCM with sudden-death pigs. By sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a protein corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of 90 kDa (p90) was found to be markedly decreased in the HCM-affected tissues of sudden-death pigs, but not in HCM or normal pigs. Further study showed that the primary decrease of p90 in HCM pigs with sudden death was located mainly in the interventricular septum. As determined by the molecular mass and isoelectric point on 2-dimensional gels and Western immunoblot with a specific 90 kDa heat shock protein (HSP90) monoclonal antibody, the unknown protein was identified as HSP90. Our findings indicate for the first time that substantially decreased heart HSP90 is associated with HCM pigs with sudden death. Although the role that HSP90 may play in protecting pigs with HCM from sudden death is still nuclear, the model itself may provide further insight into understanding the role of heat shock proteins in cardiac sudden death.-Lee, W.-C., Lin, K.-Y., Chiu, Y.-T., Lin, J.-H., Cheng, H.-C., Huang, H.-C., Yang, P.-C., Liu, S.-K., Mao, S. J. T. Substantial decrease of heat shock protein 90 in ventricular tissues of two sudden-death pigs with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy."
https://openalex.org/W1483884909,"Apoptosis (programmed cell death) is an essential physiological process that is genetically regulated and contributes to the balance between cell growth, differentiation, and the maintenance of normal cells. Recent studies show that deprivation of growth factor induces apoptosis in endothelial cells. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating apoptosis remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that deprivation of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) increased the expression of interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme (ICE) protein, and subsequently induced apoptosis in murine aortic endothelial (MAE) cells. In contrast, the proteins of the tumor suppressor p53 and c-myc were undetected during apoptosis. This apoptosis was suppressed by the tetrapeptide ICE inhibitor, Ac-YVAD-CMK. Overexpression of murine ICE, in addition, induced apoptosis in MAE cells using gene transfer techniques. These results strongly suggest that ICE may mediate apoptosis in bFGF-deprived endothelial cells, and the suppression of ICE function could represent a novel approach for the protection of endothelial cells from damages.-Kondo, S., Kondo, Y., Yin, D., Barnett, G. H., Kaakaji, R., Peterson, J. W., Morimura, T., Kubo, H., Takeuchi, J., Barna, B. P.

https://openalex.org/W1812481280,"Expression studies of multigene families, such as the immunoglobulin (Ig) loci, are difficult because of their large size and the necessity to introduce germline configured regions into an animal. Antibody diversity from Ig gene miniloci is limited by the number of variable (V) region genes and the need for distal regulatory elements to control expression. Here, we show germline transfer into mice of a 1300 kb human Igκ light chain locus on a yeast artificial chromosome that resulted in early DNA rearrangement and highly efficient human light chain expression. The human locus was assembled from a 300 kb authentic region using contig extension by addition of cosmid multimers to supplement the variable gene cluster. This resulted in the addition of about 100 V region genes in germline configuration from different families. In transgenic animals with Igκ disruption, this large human κ locus replaced the endogenous locus, and subsequent down-regulation of Igλ light chain contribution led to a dominant expression of the rearranged human genes. Contrary to expectation, rather than providing a solely selective advantage for ensuring repertoire formation controlled by the sheer number of introduced genes, the λ/κ ratio in serum appears to be the result of competition for early surface Ig expression maintained in the developing B cell.—Zou, X., Xian, J., Davies, N. P., Popov, A. V., Brüggemann, M. Dominant expression of a 1.3 Mb human Igκ locus replacing mouse light chain production. FASEB J. 10, 1227-1232 (1996)"
