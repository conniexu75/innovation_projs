https://openalex.org/W2982381007,"Controlling electrode growth Batteries with metal anodes can grow dendrites during cycling, which can cause short circuits in a battery or subsequently reduce the charge capacity. Zheng et al. developed a process to electrodeposit zinc on a graphene-coated stainless-steel electrode, such that the zinc forms plates with preferential orientation parallel to the electrode. This is achieved by depositing a graphene layer on stainless steel designed to epitaxially match the basal (002) plane of metallic zinc, minimizing lattice strain. During cycling, the zinc will redeposit in plate form rather than as a dendrite such that the batteries show excellent reversibility over thousands of cycles. Science , this issue p. 645"

Combining two single-cell RNA sequencing technologies, we produced transcriptomes of CD45+ immune cells for HCC patients from five immune-relevant sites: tumor, adjacent liver, hepatic lymph node (LN), blood, and ascites. A cluster of LAMP3+ dendritic cells (DCs) appeared to be the mature form of conventional DCs and possessed the potential to migrate from tumors to LNs. LAMP3+ DCs also expressed diverse immune-relevant ligands and exhibited potential to regulate multiple subtypes of lymphocytes. Of the macrophages in tumors that exhibited distinct transcriptional states, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) were associated with poor prognosis, and we established the inflammatory role of SLC40A1 and GPNMB in these cells. Further, myeloid and lymphoid cells in ascites were predominantly linked to tumor and blood origins, respectively. The dynamic properties of diverse CD45+ cell types revealed by this study add new dimensions to the immune landscape of HCC.

The dynamic properties of diverse CD45+ cell types revealed by this study add new dimensions to the immune landscape of HCC. Liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the world (Forner et al., 2018Forner A. Reig M. Bruix J. Hepatocellular carcinoma.Lancet. 2018; 391: 1301-1314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2849) Google Scholar), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for approximately 90% of the incidence of all liver cancers (Bray et al., 2018Bray F. Ferlay J. Soerjomataram I. Siegel R.L. Torre L.A. Jemal A. Global cancer statistics 2018: GLOBOCAN estimates of incidence and mortality worldwide for 36 cancers in 185 countries.CA Cancer J. Clin. 2018; 68: 394-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (50607) Google Scholar). Although treatments with sorafenib and regorafenib lead to a modest survival benefit, overall anti-tumor responses are still limited (Llovet et al., 2008Llovet J.M. Ricci S. Mazzaferro V. Hilgard P. Gane E. Blanc J.F. de Oliveira A.C. Santoro A. Raoul J.L. Forner A. et al.SHARP Investigators Study GroupSorafenib in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma.N. Engl. J.

Hepatol. 2017; 14: 326Google Scholar). Although immunotherapies have clinical benefits for other cancer indications, the response rates in HCC are much lower (El-Khoueiry et al., 2017El-Khoueiry A.B.

Because parameters of the immune contexture have been associated with treatment efficacy (Gnjatic et al., 2017Gnjatic S. Bronte V. Brunet L.R. Butler M.O. Disis M.L. Galon J. Hakansson L.G. Hanks B.A. Karanikas V. Khleif S.N. et al.Identifying baseline immune-related biomarkers to predict clinical outcome of immunotherapy.J. Immunother. Cancer. 2017; 5: 44Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), it is important to characterize the baseline HCC immune milieu to clarify the composition and property of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in comparison with ones in other immune-relevant anatomical compartments. The cellular components of the tumor microenvironment (TME) are highly complex, with diverse populations of myeloid cells and lymphocytes playing important roles in inflammation, cancer immune evasion, and responses to immunotherapy treatment (Hackl et al., 2016Hackl H.

The presence of myeloid cells in the TME is often linked to altered patient survival (Engblom et al., 2016Engblom C. Pfirschke C. Pittet M.J. The role of myeloid cells in cancer therapies.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16: 447-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have been reported to prevent T cells from recognizing and killing cancer cells (Peranzoni et al., 2018Peranzoni E. Lemoine J. Vimeux L. Feuillet V. Barrin S.

Conventional dendritic cell (DC) subsets (cDC1 and cDC2) have been reported to migrate into tumor-draining LN and prime CD8+ or CD4+ T cells in mouse models (Binnewies et al., 2019Binnewies M.

However, the characteristics and functions of TAM and DC subsets in HCC patients are still poorly understood. We have previously characterized T cells in HCC by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) (Zheng et al., 2017aZheng C. Zheng L. Yoo J.K. Guo H. Zhang Y. Guo X. Kang B. Hu R. Huang J.Y.

Recently, studies characterizing immune cell subsets of the TME have emerged, including mass cytometry studies (Chevrier et al., 2017Chevrier S. Levine J.H. Zanotelli V.R.T. Silina K. Schulz D.

Park Y.H. et al.Single-cell RNA-seq enables comprehensive tumour and immune cell profiling in primary breast cancer.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 15081Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), paving the way for such studies for HCC. The scRNA-seq technologies in the aforementioned studies were based on either SMART-seq2 (Picelli et al., 2014Picelli S. Faridani O.R. Björklund A.K. Winberg G. Sagasser S. Sandberg R. Full-length RNA-seq from single cells using Smart-seq2.Nat. Protoc. 2014; 9: 171-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (1958) Google Scholar) or droplet-based platforms (Zheng et al., 2017bZheng G.X. Terry J.M. Belgrader P. Ryvkin P. Bent Z.W. Wilson R. Ziraldo S.B. Wheeler T.D. McDermott G.P. Zhu J. et al.Massively parallel digital transcriptional profiling of single cells.Nat. Commun. 2017; 8: 14049Crossref PubMed Scopus (2300) Google Scholar). SMART-seq2 provides in-depth coverage for a smaller number of cells, whereas the droplet-based platforms capture a larger scale of cells but with the sacrifice of limited gene coverage (Ziegenhain et al., 2017Ziegenhain C. Vieth B. Parekh S. Reinius B. Guillaumet-Adkins A. Smets M. Leonhardt H. Heyn H. Hellmann I. Enard W. Comparative Analysis of Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Methods.Mol. Cell. 2017; 65: 631-643.e4Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (731) Google Scholar). Therefore, combined analysis of these two technologies may represent a preferred approach toward achieving an in-depth understanding of the broad landscape. Here we combined full-length and 3′ scRNA-seq technologies to obtain high-quality data for a large collection of CD45+ immune cells from various tissues in HCC patients. For the first time, cell composition, functional states, developmental trajectory, and cellular interactions of immune cells in HCC tumors, adjacent liver, hepatic lymph nodes (LNs), ascites, and blood were explored and compared systematically. Specifically, previously uncharacterized hepatic LNs and ascites were included to dissect the dynamics of immune cells in HCC. Excess accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity, known as ascites (Biecker, 2011Biecker E. Diagnosis and therapy of ascites in liver cirrhosis.World J. Gastroenterol. 2011; 17: 1237-1248Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, Fukui et al., 2018Fukui H. Kawaratani H. Kaji K. Takaya H. Yoshiji H. Management of refractory cirrhotic ascites: challenges and solutions.Hepat. Med. 2018; 10: 55-71Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), is associated with poor prognosis of HCC (Hsu et al., 2013Hsu C.Y. Lee Y.H. Huang Y.H. Hsia C.Y. Su C.W. Lin H.C. Lee R.C. Chiou Y.Y. Lee F.Y. Huo T.I. Lee S.D. Ascites in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma: prevalence, associated factors, prognostic impact, and staging strategy.Hepatol. Int. 2013; 7: 188-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), but the roles of ascites in shaping the tumor immune contexture are still unknown. The combination of the two scRNA-seq technologies and the inclusion of LNs and ascites allowed us to not only characterize the immune composition of HCC with high resolution but also to trace their dynamics. To characterize the immune cells in HCC, we applied scRNA-seq methods to study CD45+ cells isolated from tumors and four immune-relevant sites (adjacent liver, hepatic LNs, blood, and ascites) of 16 treatment-naive liver cancer patients (Figures S1A–S1C; Tables S1 and S2). For patient DSN09, both 10x Genomics and SMART-seq2 methods were applied in parallel, giving us the opportunity to evaluate the power of integrated analysis on two types of datasets. Using graph-based clustering (Traag et al., 2019Traag V.A. Waltman L. van Eck N.J. From Louvain to Leiden: guaranteeing well-connected communities.Sci. Rep. 2019; 9: 5233Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar) to analyze the cells from this patient, we identified 20 clusters for 10x data and 22 for SMART-seq2 (Figure 1A). Examination of canonical marker genes revealed major cell populations, including T cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and diverse myeloid-lineage cells in both platforms (Figures S1D and S1E), demonstrating the stability and accuracy of our data. Minor cell populations, though, varied between the two platforms. For instance, the LAMP3+ DC, CD14+, and FCGR3A+ monocyte groups were only identified in SMART-seq2, whereas type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) were only captured by 10x (Figure 1A). In addition, we observed that SMART-seq2 could help distinguish closely related clusters, possibly by capturing more RNA molecules that contribute to cell type classification (Svensson et al., 2017Svensson V. Natarajan K.N. Ly L.H. Miragaia R.J. Labalette C. Macaulay I.C. Cvejic A. Teichmann S.A. Power analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing experiments.Nat. Methods. 2017; 14: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). For instance, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subtypes (CD8+PDCD1+, CD8+GZMK+, and CD8+CX3CR1+ clusters) were readily separated. In contrast, 10x-based T cell clusters were composed of a mixture of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as evidenced by their simultaneous similarities to those defined by SMART-seq2 (Figure S2A). We then integrated the two types of datasets using the Harmony algorithm (Korsunsky et al., 2018Korsunsky I. Fan J. Slowikowski K. Zhang F. Wei K. Baglaenko Y. Brenner M. Loh P.-R. Raychaudhuri S. Fast, sensitive, and accurate integration of single cell data with Harmony.bioRxiv. 2018; https://doi.org/10.1101/461954Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In total, 37 clusters were identified on the combined dataset, with 36 containing cells from both 10x and SMART-seq2, indicating a well-integrated dataset (Figure 2B). Clusters 16, 29, 33, 34, 35, and 36 were dominated by 10x, each containing less than 10 cells from SMART-seq2 (Figure S2B), indicating that such rare cell populations were “rescued” by 10x. On the other hand, 129 individual cells initially in the CLEC9A+ DCs of 10x clusters were re-assigned to LAMP3+ DCs after integration, confirmed by their gene expression (Figure S2C), suggesting that the integration led to identification of rare cell populations that were masked in either platform alone. We also observed that the initial mixture of CD4+/CD8+ T cells in 10x clusters were subsequently separated after incorporation with SMART-seq2 data (Figure S2B).Figure 1Landscape of CD45+ Immune Cells in Liver CancerShow full caption(A) Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) of SMART-seq2-based (left) and 10x-based (right) single CD45+ cells from patient DSN09.

PAGA: graph abstraction reconciles clustering with trajectory inference through a topology preserving map of single cells.Genome Biol. 2019; 20: 59Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar), showing the transition potential from Mφ-c1-THBS1 to Mφ-c5-VCAN. See also Figure S4 and S5. We then examined the gene detection sensitivity. At the cluster level, the gene numbers (≥1 read) detected by SMART-seq2 were invariably more numerous than 10x and covered almost all genes detected by 10x (Figure S2D). Saturation analysis revealed that the detected gene number by SMART-seq2 was much higher than by 10x in all tissues. The gene capturing rate of 20 cells by SMART-seq2 was comparable with that of 1,000 cells by 10x (Figure 1C). Immune-relevant gene categories were also more frequently detected by SMART-seq2 than by 10x, exemplified by LAMP3+ DCs (p < 2e−16, Wilcoxon test) (Figure 1D). For all cell clusters, SMART-seq2 yielded many more differentially expressed genes than 10x. For example, the number of differentially expressed genes detected by the 15 SMART-seq2 cells in LAMP3+ DCs (LAMP3+ DCs versus other clusters) was 29 times higher than that derived from 129 10x cells (Figure 1E). Notably, transcription factors (TFs) associated with DC development, including ZBTB46, were only detected by SMART-seq2 (Figure 1E). These genes also led to additional enriched Gene Ontology (GO) terms. On average, 45 significant GO terms were obtained by SMART-seq2 versus 17 by 10x (p = 1.12e−7, Wilcoxon test) (Figure S2E). Specifically, for LAMP3+ DCs, in addition to the biological processes supported by both platforms, SMART-seq2-specific genes also revealed the enrichment of “cell-to-cell signaling” and “regulation of cell migration,” providing insight into their potential function (Figure 1F). Taken together, we conclude that the incorporation of SMART-seq2 into the widely used 10x-based scRNA-seq study has a synergistic effect on identifying immune cell types at a higher resolution. We then integrated the data from all patients, including 66,187 cells generated by 10x and 11,134 cells by SMART-seq2, and performed further analyses (Figure 1G). Clustering analysis revealed major immune cell types in HCC, including T, NK, myeloid, B, plasma B cells, and ILCs (Figures S3A and S3B). T, NK, and myeloid cells were further partitioned through a second round of clustering analysis and yielded 14, 9, and 14 clusters, respectively (Figures S3D, S4A, and S4E). The immune cell types exhibited different tissue preferences. We quantified tissue enrichment based on the ratio of observed to expected cell numbers in each cluster (Ro/e) using the 10x data (Figure 1H and Table S3). Among T cells, CD4-c6-FOXP3 and CD8-c7-PDCD1, corresponding to regulatory T (Treg) cells and exhausted CD8+ T (Tex) cells, respectively, were enriched in tumors, consistent with previous findings (Guo et al., 2018Guo X.

Carrión et al. investigated the role of endophytes, the intimate microbial community found within roots, in fungal disease suppression (see the Perspective by Tringe). The wilt fungus Rhizoctonia solani infects sugar beets, whereupon transcriptional analysis shows that several bacterial endophyte species activate biosynthetic gene clusters to cause disease suppression. These organisms produce antifungal effectors, including enzymes that can digest fungal cell walls, and secondary metabolites, including phenazines, polyketides, and siderophores, which may contribute to the antifungal phenotype.

Sleep is also associated with increased interstitial fluid volume and clearance of metabolic waste products. It is unknown why these processes co-occur and how they are related. Fultz et al. simultaneously measured electrophysiological, hemodynamic, and flow signals in the human brain (see the Perspective by Grubb and Lauritzen). Large oscillations of fluid inflow to the brain appeared during sleep and were tightly coupled to functional magnetic resonance imaging signals and entrained to electroencephalogram slow waves. Slow oscillatory neuronal activity thus leads to oscillations in blood volume, drawing cerebrospinal fluid into and out of the brain. Science , this issue p. 628 ; see also p. 572"
https://openalex.org/W2982348757,"We used 20 de novo genome assemblies to probe the speciation history and architecture of gene flow in rapidly radiating Heliconius butterflies. Our tests to distinguish incomplete lineage sorting from introgression indicate that gene flow has obscured several ancient phylogenetic relationships in this group over large swathes of the genome. Introgressed loci are underrepresented in low-recombination and gene-rich regions, consistent with the purging of foreign alleles more tightly linked to incompatibility loci. Here, we identify a hitherto unknown inversion that traps a color pattern switch locus. We infer that this inversion was transferred between lineages by introgression and is convergent with a similar rearrangement in another part of the genus. These multiple de novo genome sequences enable improved understanding of the importance of introgression and selective processes in adaptive radiation."
https://openalex.org/W2988915271,"Tight junctions are cell-adhesion complexes that seal tissues and are involved in cell polarity and signaling. Supra-molecular assembly and positioning of tight junctions as continuous networks of adhesion strands are dependent on the membrane-associated scaffolding proteins ZO1 and ZO2. To understand how zona occludens (ZO) proteins organize junction assembly, we performed quantitative cell biology and in vitro reconstitution experiments. We discovered that ZO proteins self-organize membrane-attached compartments via phase separation. We identified the multivalent interactions of the conserved PDZ-SH3-GuK supra-domain as the driver of phase separation. These interactions are regulated by phosphorylation and intra-molecular binding. Formation of condensed ZO protein compartments is sufficient to specifically enrich and localize tight-junction proteins, including adhesion receptors, cytoskeletal adapters, and transcription factors. Our results suggest that an active-phase transition of ZO proteins into a condensed membrane-bound compartment drives claudin polymerization and coalescence of a continuous tight-junction belt."

Stress exposure causes the dysfunction of peripheral T lymphocytes. However, the pathological role and underlying regulatory mechanism of peripheral T lymphocytes in mood disorders have not been well established. Here, we show that the lack of CD4+ T cells protects mice from stress-induced anxiety-like behavior. Physical stress-induced leukotriene B4 triggers severe mitochondrial fission in CD4+ T cells, which further leads to a variety of behavioral abnormalities including anxiety, depression, and social disorders. Metabolomic profiles and single-cell transcriptome reveal that CD4+ T cell-derived xanthine acts on oligodendrocytes in the left amygdala via adenosine receptor A1. Mitochondrial fission promotes the de novo synthesis of purine via interferon regulatory factor 1 accumulation in CD4+ T cells. Our study implicates a critical link between a purine metabolic disorder in CD4+ T cells and stress-driven anxiety-like behavior."

As research has expanded, it has become clear that these globally used insecticides directly affect other ecosystem components, including vertebrates. Yamamuro et al. now show that these compounds are indirectly affecting species through trophic cascades (see the Perspective by Jensen). Since the application of neonicotinoids to agricultural fields began in the 1990s, zooplankton biomass has plummeted in a Japanese lake surrounded by these fields. This decline has led to shifts in food web structure and a collapse of two commercially harvested freshwater fish species. The authors argue that such dynamics are likely occurring widely.

https://openalex.org/W2987918752,"Cell-cell junctions respond to mechanical forces by changing their organization and function. To gain insight into the mechanochemical basis underlying junction mechanosensitivity, we analyzed tight junction (TJ) formation between the enveloping cell layer (EVL) and the yolk syncytial layer (YSL) in the gastrulating zebrafish embryo. We found that the accumulation of Zonula Occludens-1 (ZO-1) at TJs closely scales with tension of the adjacent actomyosin network, revealing that these junctions are mechanosensitive. Actomyosin tension triggers ZO-1 junctional accumulation by driving retrograde actomyosin flow within the YSL, which transports non-junctional ZO-1 clusters toward the TJ. Non-junctional ZO-1 clusters form by phase separation, and direct actin binding of ZO-1 is required for stable incorporation of retrogradely flowing ZO-1 clusters into TJs. If the formation and/or junctional incorporation of ZO-1 clusters is impaired, then TJs lose their mechanosensitivity, and consequently, EVL-YSL movement is delayed. Thus, phase separation and flow of non-junctional ZO-1 confer mechanosensitivity to TJs."

This integrated computational and multifaceted experimental approach expands the peptide-GPCR network and opens the way for studies to elucidate the roles of these signaling systems in human physiology and disease. Peptide hormones and neuropeptides are ubiquitous signaling molecules that predominantly stimulate cell surface receptors in numerous physiological processes. Over 85 endogenous peptide/protein-derived drugs target 51 proteins, half of which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Wishart et al., 2018Wishart D.S. Feunang Y.D. Guo A.C. Lo E.J. Marcu A. Grant J.R. Sajed T. Johnson D. Li C. Sayeeda Z. et al.DrugBank 5.0: a major update to the DrugBank database for 2018.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: D1074-D1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (3498) Google Scholar). Moreover, such biological agents and peptide-activated GPCRs are gaining traction in current clinical trials (Hauser et al., 2017Hauser A.S. Attwood M.M. Rask-Andersen M. Schiöth H.B. Gloriam D.E. Trends in GPCR drug discovery: new agents, targets and indications.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2017; 16: 829-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). However, despite their physiological importance and therapeutic potential, the cognate interactions for numerous peptides and over 100 GPCRs remain elusive; thus, they are referred to here as “orphan” receptors (Laschet et al., 2018Laschet C. Dupuis N. Hanson J. The G protein-coupled receptors deorphanization landscape.Biochem. Pharmacol. 2018; 153: 62-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) or, for simplicity, “oGPCRs.” Deorphanization, i.e., unambiguous pairing of cognate ligands and receptors, has consistently transformed the understanding of human biology (Civelli et al., 2013Civelli O. Reinscheid R.K. Zhang Y. Wang Z. Fredriksson R. Schiöth H.B. G protein-coupled receptor deorphanizations.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2013; 53: 127-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), and illumination of understudied drug targets is a key objective of modern drug discovery (Oprea et al., 2018Oprea T.I.

Furthermore, oGPCRs typically have uncharacterized signaling pathways (Roth et al., 2017Roth B.L. Irwin J.J. Shoichet B.K. Discovery of new GPCR ligands to illuminate new biology.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2017; 13: 1143-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), necessitating the use of promiscuous G proteins (Huang et al., 2015Huang X.P. Karpiak J. Kroeze W.K. Zhu H. Chen X. Moy S.S. Saddoris K.A. Nikolova V.D. Farrell M.S. Wang S. et al.Allosteric ligands for the pharmacologically dark receptors GPR68 and GPR65.Nature. 2015; 527: 477-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and β-arrestin assays to report cellular responses (Kroeze et al., 2015Kroeze W.K. Sassano M.F. Huang X.P. Lansu K. McCorvy J.D. Giguère P.M. Sciaky N. Roth B.L. PRESTO-Tango as an open-source resource for interrogation of the druggable human GPCRome.Nat. Struct. Mol.

Screen. 2013; 18: 599-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Because not all GPCRs couple efficiently to promiscuous/chimeric G proteins and/or may not robustly induce β-arrestin recruitment, these assays may miss many bona fide receptor-ligand interactions. Equally, the pluridimensional nature of GPCR signaling and the ability of some ligands to preferentially activate one signaling pathway at the expense of others (i.e., to bias their stimulus) requires the use of multiple complementary assays to effectively study oGPCRs. Human peptide ligands, such as QRFP peptides, osteocalcin, and spexin, were discovered using bioinformatics approaches (Fukusumi et al., 2003Fukusumi S. Yoshida H. Fujii R. Maruyama M. Komatsu H. Habata Y. Shintani Y. Hinuma S. Fujino M. A new peptidic ligand and its receptor regulating adrenal function in rats.J. Biol.

However, bioinformatics approaches must account for conceptual challenges related to biological processes, including identification of signal peptides for secretion, alternative splicing of precursor genes, and enzymatic peptide cleavage (Ozawa et al., 2010Ozawa A. Lindberg I. Roth B. Kroeze W.K. Deorphanization of novel peptides and their receptors.AAPS J. 2010; 12: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Furthermore, post-translational modifications and protein folding are generally not covered by computational methods, although some sequence motif-based modifications can be predicted, such as the introduction of C-terminal amidation and disulfide bridges. Mass spectrometry-based techniques have been used to discover endogenous ligands in the mouse (Fricker, 2010Fricker L.D. Analysis of mouse brain peptides using mass spectrometry-based peptidomics: implications for novel functions ranging from non-classical neuropeptides to microproteins.Mol. Biosyst. 2010; 6: 1355-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and the human precursor proSAAS (Fricker et al., 2000Fricker L.D. McKinzie A.A. Sun J. Curran E. Qian Y. Yan L. Patterson S.D. Courchesne P.L. Richards B. Levin N. et al.Identification and characterization of proSAAS, a granin-like neuroendocrine peptide precursor that inhibits prohormone processing.J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 639-648Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), which contains bioactive peptides involved in circadian rhythms (Hatcher et al., 2008Hatcher N.G. Atkins Jr., N. Annangudi S.P. Forbes A.J. Kelleher N.L. Gillette M.U. Sweedler J.V. Mass spectrometry-based discovery of circadian peptides.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2008; 105: 12527-12532Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). However, mass spectrometry can be limited in terms of detection of low-abundance peptides in complex samples. Here we provide an integrated computational and experimental approach for peptide-oGPCR pairing (Figure S1). We initially utilized comparative sequence and structural analyses to gain biological insights into the human peptide-receptor signaling landscape and leveraged these features to mine candidate peptide ligands in the human genome. We then identified interactions via multiple orthogonal assay platforms to independently screen class A GPCRs against key signal transduction events. Ultimately, we discovered potential endogenous peptide ligands for five oGPCRs as well as secondary ligands for a number of known peptide receptors. Initially, we explored the current knowledge regarding endogenous ligands and receptor systems by evaluating 341 peptide/protein (encoded by 160 genes) and 174 non-peptide ligands (Harding et al., 2018Harding S.D. Sharman J.L. Faccenda E. Southan C. Pawson A.J. Ireland S. Gray A.J.G. Bruce L. Alexander S.P.H. Anderton S. et al.NC-IUPHARThe IUPHAR/BPS Guide to PHARMACOLOGY in 2018: updates and expansion to encompass the new guide to IMMUNOPHARMACOLOGY.Nucleic Acids Res. 2018; 46: D1091-D1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1399) Google Scholar). Both ligand classes mediate physiological functions predominantly through GPCRs (67% and 64%, respectively; Figure 1A; Table S1). The entire network of known interactions between GPCRs and cognate ligands spans 348 reported interactions between 120 receptors and 185 peptides. These interactions range from simple receptor-ligand systems with a one-to-one relationship to complex many-to-many systems (Figure 1D). For instance, the peptide hormone motilin signals through a single receptor, whereas the melanocortin and purinergic P2Y receptors are activated by multiple peptides and nucleotides, respectively. On average, each receptor is activated by 2.9 peptide or 1.7 non-peptidergic ligands. Peptides are larger (average molecular weight, 7.7 kDa versus 0.4 kDa) and interact with their targets with higher affinity (average pKi: 9.4 versus 8.0) and potency (average pEC/IC50: 9.0 versus 6.9) than non-peptides (Figures 1B and 1C; Table S1). The mRNA abundance is generally lower for peptide than non-peptide GPCRs (Figure S2A), although peptide ligand precursors and both types of receptors are expressed in all organs. Taken together, our most common and potent type of signaling molecules evolved through genetic encoding.Figure S2The Peptidergic Signaling System Has Been Shaped by Co-evolution of Ligands and Their Receptor Targets, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) Receptors and their ligands are ubiquitously expressed in human organs and tissues. The data is ordered by mean level of peptide receptor expression. Peptide receptors consistently had lower median expression levels than non-peptide GPCRs.

(D) Jaccard index similarity of human peptide receptor and ligand precursor repertoires (n = 131 and 130, respectively) to selected species ordered by evolutionary distance. Data in Tables S1 and S2. Next, we sought to investigate how the success of peptide ligands was shaped together with their cognate receptors (Mirabeau and Joly, 2013Mirabeau O. Joly J.S. Molecular evolution of peptidergic signaling systems in bilaterians.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2013; 110: E2028-E2037Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) by analyzing 23,606,407 peptide-GPCR relationships across 313 eukaryotic genomes. When considering the minimal signaling system of one peptide and receptor, we found that 39 of 42 (93%) of the known human families arose during vertebrate evolution (Table S2), consistent with two early genome duplications (Holland et al., 1994Holland P.W. Garcia-Fernàndez J. Williams N.A. Sidow A. Gene duplications and the origins of vertebrate development.Dev. Suppl. 1994; 1994: 125-133Google Scholar). Notably, among all receptor families in all species, few have only the precursor (4%) or GPCR (15%) gene, indicating nearly universal coevolution. Moreover, by generating evolutionary fingerprints of conserved or lost gene orthologs (Figure S2B), we observed significantly higher coevolution of cognate ligand-receptor than random protein-protein pairs (average identities of 91% and 56%, respectively). This coevolution is higher (average identities of 95% and 89%, respectively) when merging the fingerprints of peptide precursors, but not of GPCRs, within the same receptor family (Figure S2C). These results suggest higher evolutionary pressure to conserve the distinct physiological function of receptors than ligands. Similarly, we found that the human receptor repertoire is more conserved than peptide ligands (average J = 0.64 versus 0.49; Figure S2D). Thus, cognate peptides and GPCRs have coevolved, and ligands have been more adaptive than receptors in shaping new signaling systems. We next explored whether comparative genomics and biological processing paradigms could be predictively used to identify peptide precursors and peptides. We found that 99% of all peptide ligand precursors contain an N-terminal signal peptide (Figure 2A), a requirement for extracellular secretion (Blobel and Dobberstein, 1975Blobel G. Dobberstein B. Transfer of proteins across membranes. I. Presence of proteolytically processed and unprocessed nascent immunoglobulin light chains on membrane-bound ribosomes of murine myeloma.J. Cell Biol. 1975; 67: 835-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (1833) Google Scholar). Proteins are enzymatically cleaved at specific sites (Ozawa et al., 2010Ozawa A. Lindberg I. Roth B. Kroeze W.K. Deorphanization of novel peptides and their receptors.AAPS J. 2010; 12: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and we found that 80%/66% of the 184 human peptide ligand N/C termini are flanked by a dibasic motif (with a conserved glycine at C termini; Figure 2B). In addition, evolutionary trace analysis showed that known peptides make up the most conserved segments of precursor sequences (Wilcoxon rank-sum test, p < 1 × 10−5; Figure 2C). Strikingly, the peptide ligand subsequences can be recognized precisely within their precursors as highly conserved segments flanked by consensus cleavage sites, the signal peptide, or the C terminus (Figure 2D). We then investigated the characteristic features of peptide receptors. By multi-dimensional scaling of residue properties across all aligned GPCR positions, we found that the vast majority of class A GPCRs cluster by ligand type and that protein and peptide receptors exhibit separate clusters (Figure 3A). GPCR structure analysis revealed a characteristic β sheet in the second extracellular loop with a distinct sequence conservation pattern (Figure 3B) and a long (>20 amino acid) distal segment of this loop that is twice as common in peptide receptors compared with non-peptide receptors (Figure 3C). Furthermore, principal-component analysis of GPCR structures revealed a clear separation of the peptide/protein receptors. Displacement trajectories of the two most significant principal components showed that the residue positions with the largest deviation from the average inactive structure are located within the extracellular portions of transmembrane helices 1–5 and the first two extracellular loops (Figure 3D). Moreover, these structures of peptide/protein receptors have nearly three times larger binding cavities than non-peptide GPCRs (mean volume, 1,226 Å3 and 469 Å3, respectively; Figure 3E). Taken together, these analyses reveal several sequence and structural characteristics, of which the β sheet, a long ECL2, and a large binding cavity can directly facilitate the binding of large proteins/peptides. We sought to investigate whether it was possible to mine potential peptide ligands from the entire human proteome. First we identified putative precursors by sequentially filtering for proteins annotated in Swiss-Prot as secreted or with a signal peptide (∼4,800) and those with unknown or precursor-compatible functional annotations (∼1,400) (Figure 2A). This yielded 1,227 “peptide cleavage variants,” representing candidate ligands that span the precursor signal peptide and C terminus or intermediate consensus cleavage sites. We selected representative cleavage variants for pharmacological screening using a 5-fold cross-validated random forest classifier based on length and several evolutionary conservation scores of known peptides and their precursors. This analysis resulted in 120 peptide sequences representing the most plausible GPCR ligands. These were combined with 43 recently proposed unpaired rat peptides (Secher et al., 2016Secher A. Kelstrup C.D. Conde-Frieboes K.W. Pyke C. Raun K. Wulff B.S. Olsen J.V. Analytic framework for peptidomics applied to large-scale neuropeptide identification.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7: 11436Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) to give a total of 163 putative peptide ligands, 112 of which came from precursors that have not been associated previously with GPCR activity. The final library containing 218 peptides was subsequently synthesized, including 55 known class A GPCR ligands (Table S5). To account for post-translational modification, we incorporated disulfide bridges and C-terminal amidation in 26 and 77 peptides, respectively. This synthetic peptide library contained the most GPCR ligand-like peptide cleavage variant, in effect “lead ligands” for primary screening. In parallel, the conserved characteristics allowed us to predict peptide-activated receptors, of which we selected 21 class A GPCRs with rodent ortholog diverse disease associations (Table S5). Our cell lines for 15 (71%) oGPCRs displayed robust doxycycline-induced cell surface expression, and 12 (57%) promoted constitutive G protein signaling, including couplings for three receptors not reported previously (Figure S3). Furthermore, 10 oGPCR cell lines were validated with commercially available compounds (Table S5). GPCRs can couple to multiple signaling pathways, with the combined signals constituting an overall response (Kenakin, 2017bKenakin T. Signaling bias in drug discovery.Expert Opin. Drug Discov. 2017; 12: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The measured response can appear different depending on the signal pathway, cell type, and time course investigated. Ligands can also intrinsically favor given receptor conformations that preferentially activate specific pathways (Kenakin, 2017bKenakin T. Signaling bias in drug discovery.Expert Opin. Drug Discov. 2017; 12: 321-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). These phenomena of assay-dependent observational bias and ligand-mediated signal bias are especially problematic for orphan and understudied receptors with poorly characterized signaling pathways (Huang et al., 2015Huang X.P. Karpiak J. Kroeze W.K. Zhu H. Chen X. Moy S.S. Saddoris K.A. Nikolova V.D. Farrell M.S.

Shoichet B.K. Discovery of new GPCR ligands to illuminate new biology.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2017; 13: 1143-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). For these reasons, we screened our 218 peptides and 21 predicted peptide receptors in three complementary orthogonal assay platforms to cover multiple aspects of GPCR activation. The dynamic mass redistribution assay is ideal for investigating oGPCR activation because it captures most (including all G protein) signaling pathways (Fang et al., 2008Fang Y. Frutos A.G.

Protoc. 2011; 6: 1748-1760Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). The second assay measures pathway-independent receptor internalization from the surface to the inside of cells (Foster and Bräuner-Osborne, 2018Foster S.R. Bräuner-Osborne H. Investigating Internalization and Intracellular Trafficking of GPCRs: New Techniques and Real-Time Experimental Approaches.Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2018; 245: 41-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). These assays are both time resolved and provide valuable insights into receptor signaling kinetics. The third, the β-arrestin recruitment assay, is a highly amplified reporter gene-based readout of GPCR signaling (Kroeze et al., 2015Kroeze W.K. Sassano M.F. Huang X.P. Lansu K. McCorvy J.D. Giguère P.M. Sciaky N. Roth B.L. PRESTO-Tango as an open-source resource for interrogation of the druggable human GPCRome.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2015; 22: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) that increases the sensitivity of detecting positive pairings and allowed us to rapidly screen an additional 46 orphan/understudied and 27 known peptide-activated class A GPCRs (Table S6). Collectively, these three assays provided an ideal platform to detect peptide ligands for undercharacterized GPCRs and enabled physical interrogation of 21,446 potential peptide-receptor interactions. We confirmed the activity of known agonists for 21 (78%) recognized peptide receptors using the β-arrestin recruitment assay. Our multifaceted screening identified peptide-mediated responses for all 21 predicted orphan peptide receptors (Figure 4A; Table S6). These results validate our computational peptide library design and provide good experimental coverage of receptor signaling. The three screening platforms demonstrated large variation in peptide pairings/GPCR targets (receptor internalization, 24/6; β-arrestin recruitment, 57/21; and mass redistribution, 75/18; Table S6). We identified peptides that robustly activated bombesin receptor 3 (BB3), GPR1, GPR15, GPR55, and GPR68 in multiple primary assays (Figure 4A; Table S6). Notably, all GPR55 and GPR68 peptides were inactive in β-arrestin recruitment, and, conversely, GPR1 pairings were only observed in this assay, indicating potential ligand-mediated G protein and β-arrestin signal pathway bias, respectively. For the additional receptors only screened in the β-arrestin recruitment assay, we observed hits for 33 (72%) oGPCRs and nine known peptide receptors (Table S6). These findings underscore the importance of broadly covering receptor signaling using a multifaceted primary screening approach and additional functional assays for hit validation (Huang et al., 2015Huang X.P. Karpiak J. Kroeze W.K. Zhu H. Chen X. Moy S.S. Saddoris K.A. Nikolova V.D. Farrell M.S.

Biol. 2015; 22: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). We extensively characterized our peptide-GPCR receptor interactions using additional orthogonal G protein and/or β-arrestin assays (Figure 4B; Figure S4; Table S7). Our peptide-receptor pairing criterion was activity in at least two assays. Furthermore, we characterized additional cleavage variants of these peptides to improve their potency (Figure 5; Figure S5). These experiments also addressed the possibility that multiple peptide variants can be endogenous agonists (Tatemoto et al., 1998Tatemoto K. Hosoya M. Habata Y. Fujii R. Kakegawa T. Zou M.X.

https://openalex.org/W2989300252,"Chromatin domains and their associated structures must be faithfully inherited through cellular division to maintain cellular identity. However, accessing the localized strategies preserving chromatin domain inheritance, specifically the transfer of parental, pre-existing nucleosomes with their associated post-translational modifications (PTMs) during DNA replication, is challenging in living cells. We devised an inducible, proximity-dependent labeling system to irreversibly mark replication-dependent H3.1 and H3.2 histone-containing nucleosomes at desired loci in mouse embryonic stem cells so that their fate after DNA replication could be followed. Strikingly, repressed chromatin domains are preserved through local re-deposition of parental nucleosomes. In contrast, nucleosomes decorating active chromatin domains do not exhibit such preservation. Notably, altering cell fate leads to an adjustment of the positional inheritance of parental nucleosomes that reflects the corresponding changes in chromatin structure. These findings point to important mechanisms that contribute to parental nucleosome segregation to preserve cellular identity."

However, as many cases are asymptomatic, a large proportion of patients remain undiagnosed until serious complications arise. Efficient, cost-effective detection of the undiagnosed may be supported by risk-prediction models relating patient factors to AF risk. However, there exists a need for an implementable risk model that is contemporaneous and informed by routinely collected patient data, reflecting the real-world pathology of AF.This study sought to develop and evaluate novel and conventional statistical and machine learning models for risk-predication of AF. This was a retrospective, cohort study of adults (aged ≥30 years) without a history of AF, listed on the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, from January 2006 to December 2016. Models evaluated included published risk models (Framingham, ARIC, CHARGE-AF), machine learning models, which evaluated baseline and time-updated information (neural network, LASSO, random forests, support vector machines), and Cox regression.Analysis of 2,994,837 individuals (3.2% AF) identified time-varying neural networks as the optimal model achieving an AUROC of 0.827 vs. 0.725, with number needed to screen of 9 vs. 13 patients at 75% sensitivity, when compared with the best existing model CHARGE-AF. The optimal model confirmed known baseline risk factors (age, previous cardiovascular disease, antihypertensive medication usage) and identified additional time-varying predictors (proximity of cardiovascular events, body mass index (both levels and changes), pulse pressure, and the frequency of blood pressure measurements).The optimal time-varying machine learning model exhibited greater predictive performance than existing AF risk models and reflected known and new patient risk factors for AF."

https://openalex.org/W2982474313,"Itaconate is an immunometabolite with both anti-inflammatory and bactericidal effects. Its coenzyme A (CoA) derivative, itaconyl-CoA, inhibits B12-dependent methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM) by an unknown mechanism. We demonstrate that itaconyl-CoA is a suicide inactivator of human and Mycobacterium tuberculosis MCM, which forms a markedly air-stable biradical adduct with the 5'-deoxyadenosyl moiety of the B12 coenzyme. Termination of the catalytic cycle in this way impairs communication between MCM and its auxiliary repair proteins. Crystallography and spectroscopy of the inhibited enzyme are consistent with a metal-centered cobalt radical ~6 angstroms away from the tertiary carbon-centered radical and suggest a means of controlling radical trajectories during MCM catalysis. Mycobacterial MCM thus joins enzymes in the glyoxylate shunt and the methylcitrate cycle as targets of itaconate in pathogen propionate metabolism."

When the Nc-tip was 100 picometers away from point contact with a surface-supported object, magnetic effects could be probed through changes in the spin excitation spectrum of nickelocene.

This reorganization apparently occurs without the usual factors that are known to lead to such structural changes during cell division, such as F-actin, myosin II, various individual kinesins, aurora kinase A, or DNA. What is required is energy from adenosine triphosphate, microtubule polymerization, cytoplasmic dynein activity, and a specific kinase-involved cell cycle progression.

https://openalex.org/W2930377639,"Differential phase-contrast computed tomography (DPC-CT) is a powerful analysis tool for soft-tissue and low-atomic-number samples. Limited by the implementation conditions, DPC-CT with incomplete projections happens quite often. Conventional reconstruction algorithms are not easy to deal with incomplete data. They are usually involved with complicated parameter selection operations, also sensitive to noise and time-consuming. In this paper, we reported a new deep learning reconstruction framework for incomplete data DPC-CT. It is the tight coupling of the deep learning neural network and DPC-CT reconstruction algorithm in the phase-contrast projection sinogram domain. The estimated result is the complete phase-contrast projection sinogram not the artifacts caused by the incomplete data. After training, this framework is determined and can reconstruct the final DPC-CT images for a given incomplete phase-contrast projection sinogram. Taking the sparse-view DPC-CT as an example, this framework has been validated and demonstrated with synthetic and experimental data sets. Embedded with DPC-CT reconstruction, this framework naturally encapsulates the physical imaging model of DPC-CT systems and is easy to be extended to deal with other challengs. This work is helpful to push the application of the state-of-the-art deep learning theory in the field of DPC-CT."

Although immunomodulatory effects of volatile anesthetics have been growingly appreciated, the molecular mechanism has not been understood. In septic mice, the commonly used volatile anesthetic isoflurane attenuated the production of 5-lipoxygenase products and IL-10 and reduced CD11b and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 expression on neutrophils, suggesting the attenuation of TLR4 signaling. We confirmed the attenuation of TLR4 signaling in vitro and their direct binding to TLR4-myeloid differentiation-2 (MD-2) complex by photolabeling experiments. The binding sites of volatile anesthetics isoflurane and sevoflurane were located near critical residues for TLR4-MD-2 complex formation and TLR4-MD-2-LPS dimerization. Additionally, TLR4 activation was not attenuated by intravenous anesthetics, except for a high concentration of propofol.

https://openalex.org/W2986132968,"β-Catenin is a multi-functional protein involved in cell adhesion and signal transduction and has a critical role in colorectal cancer development. β-Catenin positively regulates the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) mediated signal by both induction of AhR expression and enhancement of AhR-dependent gene induction. Conversely, it was reported that AhR negatively regulates the β-catenin signal via ubiquitination and subsequent degradation in a ligand dependent manner. However, there have been conflicting data among previous studies regarding the relationship between these two proteins. In this report, we conducted confirmatory studies dissecting the relationship between AhR and β-catenin. We did not observe β-catenin degradation by AhR ligands in several colon cancer cell lines. Reporter assays revealed that the AhR ligand did not alter TcF/β-catenin dependent transcription. Yeast and mammalian two-hybrid assays failed to reconstruct the interaction of β-catenin and AhR even when other factors, Arnt, CUL4B, and DDB1, were co-expressed additionally. Independently to induction of AhR expression, β-catenin enhanced AhR-dependent transcriptional activation via the xenobiotic response element (XRE). Coimmunoprecipitation detected the formation of a β-catenin and ligand-activated AhR complex, which was thought to reflect the β-catenin mediated enhancement of the AhR signaling. Overall, we could only confirm unidirectional interaction, which is positive regulation of the AhR signal by β-catenin. These results suggested that data from previous reports on the degradation of β-catenin via liganded AhR warrants further investigation to yield clarity in the field."
https://openalex.org/W2982868041,"Hypertension is one of the central causes of kidney damage. In the past it was shown that glomerular hypertension leads to morphologic changes of podocytes and effacement and is responsible for detachment of these postmitotic cells. Because we have shown that podocytes are mechanosensitive and respond to mechanical stress by reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in vitro, we look for mechanotransducers in podocytes. In this study, we demonstrate that the extracellular matrix protein fibronectin (Fn1) might be a potential candidate. The present study shows that Fn1 is essential for the attachment of podocytes during mechanical stress. By real-time quantitative PCR as well as by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, we found a significant up-regulation of Fn1 caused by mechanical stretch (3 d, 0.5 Hz, and 5% extension). To study the role of Fn1 in cultured podocytes under mechanical stress, Fn1 was knocked down (Fn1 KD) by a specific small interfering RNA. Additionally, we established a Fn1 knockout (KO) podocyte cell line (Fn1 KO) by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9). During mechanical stress, a significant loss of podocytes (>80%) was observed in Fn1 KD as well as Fn1 KO podocytes compared with control cells. Furthermore, Fn1 KO podocytes showed a significant down-regulation of the focal adhesion proteins talin, vinculin, and paxillin and a reduced cell spreading, indicating an important role of Fn1 in adhesion. Analyses of kidney sections from patients with diabetic nephropathy have shown a significant up-regulation of FN1 in contrast to control biopsies. In summary, we show that Fn1 plays an important role in the adaptation of podocytes to mechanical stress.-Kliewe, F., Kaling, S., Lötzsch, H., Artelt, N., Schindler, M., Rogge, H., Schröder, S., Scharf, C., Amann, K., Daniel, C., Lindenmeyer, M.

The results showed that overexpression of miR-206 inhibited cell proliferation and promoted muscle cell differentiation, but it did not affect myofiber type conversion. Intriguingly, we found that overexpression of miR-206 suppressed muscle cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase by inhibiting the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) gene.

https://openalex.org/W2985470308,"Many closely related species are capable of mating to produce hybrid offspring, which are usually sterile. Nevertheless, altering the gametogenesis of hybrid offspring can rescue hybrids from sterility by enabling asexual reproduction. Hybridogenesis is one of the most complicated asexual reproductive modes, and it includes drastic genome reorganization only in the germline; this is achieved through elimination of one parental genome and duplication of the remaining one to restore diploid chromosomal set and overcome blocks in meiotic progression. We investigated a model of hybridogenesis, namely, water frogs from the Pelophylax esculentus complex, for the emergence of asexual reproduction. Further, we assessed the impact of its asexual reproduction on the maintenance of interspecies hybrids from two populations on the western edge of the P. esculentus range, in which hybrids coexist with either both parental species or with only one parental species. After analysing tadpole karyotypes, we conclude that in both studied populations, the majority of diploid hybrid males produced haploid gametes with the P. ridibundus genome after elimination of the P. lessonae genome. Hybrid females exhibited problems with genome elimination and duplication; they usually produced oocytes with univalents, but there were observations of individual oocytes with 13 bivalents and even 26 bivalents. In some hybrid tadpoles, especially F1 crosses, we observed failed germ cell development, while in tadpoles from backcrosses, germ cells were normally distributed and contained micronuclei. By identifying chromosomes present in micronuclei, we estimated that the majority of tadpoles from all crosses were able to selectively eliminate the P. lessonae chromosomes. According to our results, hybridogenesis in hybrids can appear both from crosses of parental species and crosses between sexual species with hybrid individuals. The ability to eliminate a genome and perform endoreplication to ensure gamete formation differed between male and female hybrids from the studied populations. Some diploid hybrid females can rarely produce not only haploid gametes but also diploid gametes, which is a crucial step in the formation of triploid hybrids."
https://openalex.org/W2986420498,"Recent studies showed that wave intensity analysis (WIA) provides clinically valuable information about local and global cardiovascular function. Wave intensity (WI) is computed as the product of the pressure change and the velocity change during short time intervals. The major limitation of WIA in clinical practice is the need for invasive pressure measurement. Since vessel wall displacement can be measured non-invasively, the usage of WI will be expanded if the vessel wall dilation is used instead of pressure in derivation of WI waveform. Our goal in this study is to investigate the agreement between wall displacement-based WI and the pressure-based WI for different vessel wall models including linear elastic, nonlinear and viscoelastic cases. The arbitrary Eulerian Lagrangian finite element method is employed to solve the coupled fluid-structure interaction (FSI). Our computational models also include two types of vascular disease-related cases with geometrical irregularities, aneurysm and stenosis. Our results show that for vessels with linear elastic wall, the displacement-based WI is almost identical to the pressure-based WI. The existence of vessel irregularities does not impact the accuracy of displacement-based WI. However, in a viscoelastic wall where there is a phase difference between pressure and vessel wall dilation, displacement-based WI deviated from pressure-based WI. The error associated with this phase difference increased nonlinearly with increasing viscosity. This results in a maximum error of 6.8% and 7.13% for a regular viscoelastic vessel wall and an irregular viscoelastic vessel wall, respectively. A separate analysis has also been performed on the agreement of backward and forward running waves extracted from a decomposition of the displacement-based and pressure-based WI. Our findings suggest that displacement-based WI is a reliable method of WIA for large central arteries that do not show viscoelastic behaviors. This can be clinically significant since the required information can be measured non-invasively."

Ang-(1-7) treatment also inhibited neutrophil and eosinophil chemotaxis ex vivo. These changes were reversed following pre-treatment with A779. These data show that the anti-inflammatory actions of Ang-(1-7)/ MAS1 receptor axis are mediated, at least in part, via inhibition of Src-dependent transactivation of EGFR and downstream signaling molecules such as ERK1/2. This study therefore shows that inhibition of the Src/EGRF/ERK1/2 dependent signaling pathway is one of the mechanisms by which the Ang-(1-7)/ MAS1 receptor axis mediates it anti-inflammatory effects in diseases such as asthma."
https://openalex.org/W2983513174,"Lindera Thunb. (Lauraceae) consists of approximately 100 species, mainly distributed in the temperate and tropical regions of East Asia. In this study, we report 20 new, complete plastome sequences including 17 Lindera species and three related species, Actinodaphne lancifolia, Litsea japonica and Sassafras tzumu. The complete plastomes of Lindera range from 152,502 bp (L. neesiana) to 154,314 bp (L. erythrocarpa) in length. Eleven small inversion (SI) sites are documented among the plastomes. Six of the 11 SI sites are newly reported and they locate in rpoB-trnC, psbC-trnS, petA-psbJ, rpoA and ycf2 regions. The distribution patterns of SIs are useful for species identification. An average of 83 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were detected in each plastome. The mono-SSRs accounted for 72.7% of total SSRs, followed by di- (12.4%), tetra- (9.4%), tri- (4.2%), and penta-SSRs (1.3%). Of these SSRs, 64.6% were distributed in an intergenic spacer (IGS) region. In addition, 79.8% of the SSRs are located in a large single copy (LSC) region. In contrast, almost no SSRs are distributed in inverted repeat (IR) regions. The SSR loci are useful to identifying species but the phylogenetic value is low because the majority of them show autapomorphic status or highly homoplastic characteristics. The nucleotide diversity (Pi) values also indicated the conserved nature of the IR region compared to LSC and small single copy (SSC) regions. Five spacer regions with high Pi values, trnH-psbA, petA-psbJ and ndhF-rpl32, rpl32-trnL and Ψycf1-ndhF, have a potential use for the molecular identification study of Lindera and related species. Lindera species form a paraphyletic group in the plastome tree because of the inclusion of related genera such as Actinodaphne, Laurus, Litsea and Neolitsea. A former member of tribe Laureae, Sassafras, forms a clade with the tribe Cinnamomeae. The SIs do not affect the phylogenetic relationship of Laureae. This result indicated that ancient plastome captures may have contribute to the mixed intergeneric relationship of Laureae. Alternatively, the result may indicate that the morphological characters defined the genera of Lauraceae originated for several times."
https://openalex.org/W2986120235,"Background Prostate cancer is a major public health issue, mainly because patients relapse after androgen deprivation therapy. Proteomic strategies, aiming to reflect the functional activity of cells, are nowadays among the leading approaches to tackle the challenges not only of better diagnosis, but also of unraveling mechanistic details related to disease etiology and progression. Methods We conducted here a large SILAC-based Mass Spectrometry experiment to map the proteomes and phosphoproteomes of four widely used prostate cell lines, namely PNT1A, LNCaP, DU145 and PC3, representative of different cancerous and hormonal status. Results We identified more than 3000 proteins and phosphosites, from which we quantified more than 1000 proteins and 500 phosphosites after stringent filtering. Extensive exploration of this proteomics and phosphoproteomics dataset allowed characterizing housekeeping as well as cell-line specific proteins, phosphosites and functional features of each cell line. In addition, by comparing the sensitive and resistant cell lines, we identified protein and phosphosites differentially expressed in the resistance context. Further data integration in a molecular network highlighted the differentially expressed pathways, in particular migration and invasion, RNA splicing, DNA damage repair response and transcription regulation. Conclusions Overall, this study proposes a valuable resource toward the characterization of proteome and phosphoproteome of four widely used prostate cell lines and reveals candidates to be involved in prostate cancer progression for further experimental validation."

Full shift sampling and examination were performed on the second or third day of a working week after a work free weekend, with additional sampling on the fourth or fifth day. Logistic, linear and mixed model analyses were performed including, gender, age, smoking, infections, sampling day, body mass index (BMI) and chemical binders as covariates.The adjusted average respirable quartz and dust concentrations were 0.038 and 0.66 mg/m3, respectively. Statistically significant increases in levels of CC16 were associated with exposure to chemical binders (p = 0.05; p = 0.01) in the regression analysis of quartz and respirable dust, respectively. Non-significant exposure-responses were identified for cumulative quartz and the symptoms asthma and breathlessness. For cumulative chemical years, non-significant exposure-response were observed for all but two symptoms. FENO also exhibited a non significant exposure-response for both quartz and respirable dust. No exposure-response was determined for FEV1 or FVC, CRP and respirable dust and quartz.Our findings suggest that early markers of pulmonary effect, such as increased levels of CC16 and FENO, are more strongly associated with chemical binder exposure than respirable quartz and dust in foundry environments."
https://openalex.org/W2984106671,"Glucocorticoid (GC) therapy decreases bone mass and increases the risk of fractures. We investigated interactions between the GC dexamethasone (DEX) and the bone resorptive agents 1, 25(OH) 2 ‐vitamin D 3 (D3) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) on osteoclastogenesis. We observed a synergistic potentiation of osteoclast progenitor cell differentiation and formation of osteoclasts when DEX was added to either D3‐ or PTH‐treated mouse bone marrow cell (BMC) cultures. Cotreatment of DEX with D3 or PTH increased gene encoding calcitonin receptor (Calcr) , acid phosphatase 5, tartrate resistant (Acp5) , cathepsin K (Ctsk) , and TNF superfamily member 11 (Tnfsf11) mRNA, receptor activator of NF‐κB ligand protein (RANKL), numbers of osteoclasts on plastic, and pit formation and release of C‐terminal fragment of type I collagen from cells cultured on bone slices. Enhanced RANKL protein expression caused by D3 and DEX was absent in BMC from mice in which the GC receptor (GR) was deleted in stromal cells/osteoblasts. Synergistic interactions between DEX and D3 on RANKL and osteoclast formation were present in BMC from mice with attenuated GR dimerization. These data demonstrate that the GR cooperates with D3 and PTH signaling, causing massive osteoclastogenesis, which may explain the rapid bone loss observed with high dosages of GC treatment.—Conaway, H.

https://openalex.org/W2989151273,"Timely adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) signal event detection is essential to minimise further vaccinees receiving unsafe vaccines. We explored the proportional reporting ratio (PRR) ability to detect two known signal events with influenza vaccines with the aim of providing a model for prospective routine signal detection and improving vaccine safety surveillance in Australia.Passive AEFI surveillance reports from 2008-2017 relating to influenza vaccines were accessed from the Australian SAEFVIC (Victoria) database. Proportional reporting ratios were calculated for two vaccine-event categories; fever and allergic AEFI. Signal detection sensitivity for two known signal events were determined using weekly data; cumulative data by individual year and; cumulative for all previous years. Signal event thresholds of PRR ≥2 and Chi-square ≥4 were applied.PRR provided sensitive signal detection when calculated cumulatively by individual year or by all previous years. Known signal events were detected 15 and 11 days earlier than traditional methods used at the time of the actual events.Utilising a single jurisdiction's data, PRR improved vaccine pharmacovigilance and showed the potential to detect important safety signals much earlier than previously. It has potential to maximise immunisation safety in Australia. This study progresses the necessary work to establish national cohesion for passive surveillance signal detection and strengthen routine Australian vaccine pharmacovigilance."
https://openalex.org/W2942848779,"Background There are 32 teaching hospitals in France, including 30 University hospitals and two Regional teaching hospitals. Teaching hospitals have three roles: health care provision, training of healthcare professionals, and medical research. These roles lead to frequent interactions with pharmaceutical and medical device companies, inevitably raising risks of conflicts of interests. Therefore, policies to manage conflict of interests (COI) are crucial. This study aims to examine COI policies in French teaching hospitals. Methods All French teaching hospitals (n = 32) were included in this study. All hospitals websites were screened for institutional COI policies and curriculum on COI, using standardized keyword searches. More data were collected through a questionnaire addressed to each chief executive officer (CEO) of the teaching hospital. We used predefined criteria (n = 20) inspired by similar surveys on COI policies in French, US and Canadian medical schools, with some additions to reflect the local hospital context. A global score for each hospital, ranging from 0 to 60 (higher scores denoting stronger policies) was calculated by summing points obtained for each criterion. Results All 32 hospitals had websites; 21 hospitals listed policies or regulations on their websites or provided them on request. In December 2017, 17 (53.1%) had rules and regulations for some items only, four of which (12.5%) have considered implementing a policy, and only two (6.3%) have begun implementation. 15 (46.9%) had no evidence of COI policies and a null score. The maximum score was 24 out of 60. Conclusion This is the first systematic assessment of COI policies in teaching hospitals in France. Such policies are needed to protect patients, clinicians and students from undue commercial influence. Despite public and political pressure for better management of COI, few teaching hospitals have implemented comprehensive and protective policies, and some hospitals lacked policies altogether. These results highlight the need for greater attention to management of COI within teaching hospitals. One potential solution would be to integrate COI policies into hospital accreditation procedures, in order to ensure a baseline of management at all teaching hospitals."
https://openalex.org/W2987742716,"Reaching an acceptable participation rate in screening programs is challenging. With the objective of supporting the Belarus government to implement mammography screening as a single intervention, we analyse the main determinants of breast cancer screening participation.We developed a discrete choice experiment using a mixed research approach, comprising a literature review, in-depth interviews with key informants (n = 23), ""think aloud"" pilots (n = 10) and quantitative measurement of stated preferences for a representative sample of Belarus women (n = 428, 89% response rate). The choice data were analysed using a latent class logit model with four classes selected based on statistical (consistent Akaike information criterion) and interpretational considerations.Women in the sample were representative of all six geographic regions, mainly urban (81%), and high-education (31%) characteristics. Preferences of women in all four classes were primarily influenced by the perceived reliability of the test (sensitivity and screening method) and costs. Travel and waiting time were important components in the decision for 34% of women. Most women in Belarus preferred mammography screening to the existing clinical breast examination (90%). However, if the national screening program is restricted in capacity, this proportion of women will drop to 55%. Women in all four classes preferred combined screening (mammography with clinical breast examination) to single mammography. While this preference was stronger if lower test sensitivity was assumed, 28% of women consistently gave more importance to combined screening than to test sensitivity.Women in Belarus were favourable to mammography screening. Population should be informed that there are no benefits of combined screening compared to single mammography. The results of this study are directly relevant to policy makers and help them targeting the screening population."
https://openalex.org/W2983487111,"There is dearth of data regarding the treatment-seeking practice of women living with vaginal fistula. The paper describes the health-seeking behaviour of fistula cases in the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where the burden of the problem is high.The data of 1,317 women who ever experienced fistula-related symptom were extracted from 16 national Demographic and Health Surveys carried out in SSA between 2010 and 2017. The association between treatment-seeking and basic socio-demographic characteristics was analysed via mixed-effects logistic regression and the outputs are provided using adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).Among all women who had fistula-related symptom, 67.6% encountered the problem soon after delivery, possibly implying obstetric fistula. Fewer identified sexual assault (3.8%) and pelvic surgery (2.7%) as the underlying cause. In 25.8% of the cases clear-cut causes couldn't be ascertained and, excluding these ambiguous causes, 91.2% of the women possibly had obstetric fistula. Among those who ever had any kind of fistula, 60.3% (95% CI: 56.9-63.6%) sought treatment and 28.5% (95% CI: 25.3-31.6%) underwent fistula-repair surgery. The leading reasons for not seeking treatment were: unaware that it can be repaired (21.4%), don't know where to get the treatment (17.4%), economic constraints (11.9%), the fistula healed by itself (11.9%) and feeling of embarrassment (7.9%). The regression analysis indicated, teenagers as compared to adults 35 years or older [AOR = 0.31 (95% CI: 0.20-47)]; and women without formal education compared to women with formal education [AOR = 0.69 (95% CI: 0.51-0.93)], had reduced odds of treatment-seeking. In 25.9% of the women who underwent fistula-repair surgery, complete continence after surgery was not achieved.Treatment-seeking for fistula remains low and it should be improved through addressing health-system, psycho-social, economic and awareness barriers."
https://openalex.org/W2984596527,"Biochar is being discussed as a soil amendment to improve soil fertility and mitigate climate change. While biochar interactions with soil microbial biota have been frequently studied, interactions with soil mesofauna are understudied. We here present an experiment in which we tested if the collembolan Folsomia candida I) can transport biochar particles, II) if yes, how far the particles are distributed within 10 days, and III) if it shows a preference among biochars made from different feedstocks, i.e. pine wood, pine bark and spelt husks. In general, biochar particles based on pine bark and pine wood were consistently distributed significantly more than those made of spelt husks, but all types were transported more than 4cm within 10 days. Additionally, we provide evidence that biochar particles can become readily attached to the cuticle of collembolans and hence be transported, potentially even over large distances. Our study shows that the soil mesofauna can indeed act as a vector for the transport of biochar particles and show clear preferences depending on the respective feedstock, which would need to be studied in more detail in the future."
https://openalex.org/W2985388182,"Pedicle screws are commonly used for posterior stabilization of the spine. When used in deformed or degenerated segments, the pedicle screws are often not fully inserted into the bone, but instead the threaded portion is exposed by 1 or 2 threads to accommodate rod placement and ensure alignment between the tulip of the screw and the rod. However, broken pedicle screws have been reported with the use of this method. The aim of this study was to determine how the fatigue life of the screw is affected by not fully inserting the screw into the bone. Spinal constructs were evaluated in accordance with ASTM F1717. The following three screw positions were subjected to compression bending fatigue loading; (i) pedicle screw fully inserted in the test block with no threads exposed (EXP-T0), (ii) pedicle screw inserted with one thread exposed outside the test block (EXP-T1), (iii) pedicle screw inserted with two threads exposed outside the test block (EXP-T2). Corresponding finite element models FEM-T0, FEM-T1 and FEM-T2 were also constructed and subjected to the same axial loading as the experimental groups to analyze the stress distribution in the pedicle screws and rods. The results showed that under a 190 N axial load, the EXP-T0 group survived the full 5 million cycles, the EXP-T1 group failed at 3.7 million cycles on average and the EXP-T2 groups failed at 1.0 million cycles on average, while the fatigue strength of both the EXP-T1 and EXP-T2 groups was 170 N. The constructs failed through fracture of the pedicle screw. In comparison to the FEM-T0 model, the maximum von Mises stress on the pedicle screw in the FEM-T1 and FEM-T2 models increased by 39% and 58%, respectively. In conclusion, this study demonstrated a drastic decrease in the fatigue life of pedicle screws when they are not full inserted into the plastic block."

https://openalex.org/W2985659135,"Enterococcus faecalis is a ubiquitous intestinal symbiont and common early colonizer of the neonatal gut. Although colonization with E. faecalis has been previously associated with decreased pathology of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), these bacteria have been also implicated as opportunistic pathogens. Here we characterized 21 strains of E. faecalis, naturally occurring in 4-day-old rats, for potentially pathogenic properties and ability to colonize the neonatal gut. The strains differed in hemolysis, gelatin liquefaction, antibiotic resistance, biofilm formation, and ability to activate the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB in cultured enterocytes. Only 3 strains, BB70, 224, and BB24 appreciably colonized the neonatal intestine on day 4 after artificial introduction with the first feeding. The best colonizer, strain BB70, effectively displaced E. faecalis of maternal origin. Whereas BB70 and BB24 significantly increased NEC pathology, strain 224 significantly protected from NEC. Our results show that different strains of E. faecalis may be pathogenic or protective in experimental NEC."
https://openalex.org/W2988123544,"Food allergies are severe immune responses to plant and animal products mediated by immunoglobulin E (IgE). Peanuts (Arachis hypogaea L.) are among the top 15 crops that feed the world. However, peanuts is among the ""big eight food allergens"", and allergies induced by peanuts are a significant public health problem and a life-threatening concern. Targeted mutation studies in peanuts demonstrate that single residue alterations in these allergen proteins could result in substantial reduction in allergenicity. Knowledge of peanut allergen proteins is confined to the allotetraploid crop and its two progenitors. We explored frequencies and positions of natural mutations in the hyperallergenic homologues Ara h 2 and Ara h 6 in newly generated sequences for 24 Arachis wild species and the crop species, assessed potential mutational impact on allergenicity using immunoblots and structural modeling, and evaluated whether these mutations follow evolutionary trends. We uncovered a wealth of natural mutations, both substitutions and gaps, including the elimination of immunodominant epitopes in some species. These molecular alterations appear to be associated with substantial reductions in allergenicity. The study demonstrated that Ara h 2 and Ara h 6 follow contrasting modes of natural selection and opposing mutational patterns, particularly in epitope regions. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a progressive trend towards immunodominant epitope evolution in Ara h 2. The findings provide valuable insight into the interactions among mutations, protein structure and immune system response, thus presenting a valuable platform for future manipulation of allergens to minimize, treat or eliminate allergenicity. The study strongly encourages exploration of genepools of economically important plants in allergenicity research."

https://openalex.org/W2989500452,"To investigate in datasets of immunologic parameters from early-onset and late-onset periodontitis patients (EOP and LOP), the existence of hidden random fluctuations (anomalies or noise), which may be the source for increased frequencies and longer periods of exacerbation, resulting in rapid progression in EOP. Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied on a dataset of 28 immunologic parameters and serum IgG titers against periodontal pathogens derived from 68 EOP and 43 LOP patients. After excluding the PCA parameters that explain the majority of variance in the datasets, i.e. the overall aberrant immune function, the remaining parameters of the residual subspace were analyzed by computing their sample entropy to detect possible anomalies. The performance of entropy anomaly detection was tested by using unsupervised clustering based on a log-likelihood distance yielding parameters with anomalies. An aggregate local outlier factor score (LOF) was used for a supervised classification of EOP and LOP. Entropy values on data for neutrophil chemotaxis, CD4, CD8, CD20 counts and serum IgG titer against Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans indicated the existence of possible anomalies. Unsupervised clustering confirmed that the above parameters are possible sources of anomalies. LOF presented 94% sensitivity and 83% specificity in identifying EOP (87% sensitivity and 83% specificity in 10-fold cross-validation). Any generalization of the result should be performed with caution due to a relatively high false positive rate (17%). Random fluctuations in immunologic parameters from a sample of EOP and LOP patients were detected, suggesting that their existence may cause more frequently periods of disease activity, where the aberrant immune response in EOP patients result in the phenotype ""rapid progression""."

But I never fully understood it until 2 months ago, when I left my Ph.D. lab in Canada for a 4-month stint in a lab in France. On my first day, Pierre—a Ph.D. student whose desk is across from mine—tapped me on my shoulder and asked: “Coffee?” I nodded and followed him down the hallway to the common room, where other grad students were filing in. One student brewed an espresso for me that was five times stronger than my normal Americano. Milk and sugar were nowhere to be found. So I sat there, gingerly sipping the bitter liquid and trying hard not to reveal my uncultured tastes, while lab chatter filled the air.

> “It's … helpful to have a venue to share the day-to-day ups and downs of life as a grad student.” 

I had traveled to France to work on a project with Pierre. We'd cooked up an idea for a collaboration when he was visiting my university, and we were excited to get started. I had no idea going in, though, that I'd also get a lesson in lab culture.

Coffee breaks are a ritualistic part of work life here. The chatter sometimes turns to serious scientific topics. But mostly, the meet-ups offer a chance to unwind—to share stories about life inside and outside the lab and to commiserate with people who understand what you're going through.

The lighthearted atmosphere and sense of community is a welcome contrast to my life in Canada, where I spent the bulk of my workdays in isolation. I went into the lab each morning with set goals for my day. At lunch, I'd keep my eyes glued to my computer while I shoveled forkfuls of salad into my mouth, trying to power through my to-do list.

Our lab held weekly meetings where we'd take turns presenting our latest work and getting feedback from colleagues. But we didn't take daily coffee breaks—or any other kind of communal break. My labmates and I were too busy collecting data and publishing papers.

Looking back now, I realize how much we were missing. Researchers need community because good ideas don't just come from reading literature and thinking deep thoughts; it's helpful to bounce ideas off others, particularly in a nonthreatening environment. It's also helpful to have a venue to share the day-to-day ups and downs of life as a grad student. How else are you supposed to know that you're not the only one suffering from challenges such as anxiety and impostor syndrome?

I could've used that kind of camaraderie 2 years ago. For 9 months, I struggled to figure out why I couldn't replicate the results of another study. I worried that something was wrong with my protocols, so I stayed up late at night reading papers, combing over their methods. My adviser was supportive, but I didn't want to pester her too much. I was also hesitant to ask my labmates for help because they had their own projects to worry about.

Eventually, my supervisor and I decided to switch our focus. At that point, though, I'd spent months feeling that I was failing in some way—that I wasn't smart enough to figure out what was going on, or that I was making novice mistakes that I wasn't even conscious of.

Would coffee breaks have solved all my problems? Probably not. But I think sharing my feelings and frustrations with my peers would have helped. They might have had ideas about steps I could take to solve my research dilemma. They might have also opened up about how they, too, suffer from setbacks and feelings of failure.

My time in France has taught me that it's important to create space for organic conversations about lab life—failures, incomprehensible data, and personal struggles. In places where that's not the norm, I think grad students should make a point of reaching out to peers, asking them to take coffee breaks or to meet up for lunch—something that I plan to do when I'm back in Canada. The life of a scientist can feel isolating, but it's much less isolating when you're connected to a supportive community.
