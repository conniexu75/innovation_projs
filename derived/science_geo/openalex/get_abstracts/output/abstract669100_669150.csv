https://openalex.org/W3130328242,"Monitoring of marine protected areas (MPAs) is critical for marine ecosystem management, yet current protocols rely on SCUBA-based visual surveys that are costly and time consuming, limiting their scope and effectiveness. Environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding is a promising alternative for marine ecosystem monitoring, but more direct comparisons to visual surveys are needed to understand the strengths and limitations of each approach. This study compares fish communities inside and outside the Scorpion State Marine Reserve off Santa Cruz Island, CA using eDNA metabarcoding and underwater visual census surveys. Results from eDNA captured 76% (19/25) of fish species and 95% (19/20) of fish genera observed during pairwise underwater visual census. Species missed by eDNA were due to the inability of MiFish 12S barcodes to differentiate species of rockfishes ( Sebastes , n = 4) or low site occupancy rates of crevice-dwelling Lythrypnus gobies. However, eDNA detected an additional 23 fish species not recorded in paired visual surveys, but previously reported from prior visual surveys, highlighting the sensitivity of eDNA. Significant variation in eDNA signatures by location (50 m) and site (~1000 m) demonstrates the sensitivity of eDNA to address key questions such as community composition inside and outside MPAs. Results demonstrate the utility of eDNA metabarcoding for monitoring marine ecosystems, providing an important complementary tool to visual methods."
https://openalex.org/W3130287405,"Face masks are an important tool for preventing the spread of COVID-19. However, it is unclear how different types of masks affect speech recognition in different levels of background noise. To address this, we investigated the effects of four masks (a surgical mask, N95 respirator, and two cloth masks) on recognition of spoken sentences in multi-talker babble. In low levels of background noise, masks had little to no effect, with no more than a 5.5% decrease in mean accuracy compared to a no-mask condition. In high levels of noise, mean accuracy was 2.8-18.2% lower than the no-mask condition, but the surgical mask continued to show no significant difference. The results demonstrate that different types of masks generally yield similar accuracy in low levels of background noise, but differences between masks become more apparent in high levels of noise."
https://openalex.org/W3129324158,"Background Facemasks are recommended to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2, but concern about inadequate gas exchange is an often cited reason for non-compliance. Research question Among adult volunteers, do either cloth masks or surgical masks impair oxygenation or ventilation either at rest or during physical activity? Study design and methods With IRB approval and informed consent, we measured heart rate (HR), transcutaneous carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) tension and oxygen levels (SpO 2 ) at the conclusion of six 10-minute phases: sitting quietly and walking briskly without a mask, sitting quietly and walking briskly while wearing a cloth mask, and sitting quietly and walking briskly while wearing a surgical mask. Brisk walking required at least a 10bpm increase in heart rate. Occurrences of hypoxemia (decrease in SpO 2 of ≥3% from baseline to a value of ≤94%) and hypercarbia (increase in CO 2 tension of ≥5 mmHg from baseline to a value of ≥46 mmHg) in individual subjects were collected. Wilcoxon signed-rank was used for pairwise comparisons among values for the whole cohort (e.g. walking without a mask versus walking with a cloth mask). Results Among 50 adult volunteers (median age 33 years; 32% with a co-morbidity), there were no episodes of hypoxemia or hypercarbia (0%; 95% confidence interval 0–1.9%). In paired comparisons, there were no statistically significant differences in either CO 2 or SpO 2 between baseline measurements without a mask and those while wearing either kind of mask mask, both at rest and after walking briskly for ten minutes. Interpretation The risk of pathologic gas exchange impairment with cloth masks and surgical masks is near-zero in the general adult population."
https://openalex.org/W3133469263,"Tracking genetic variations from positive SARS-CoV-2 samples yields crucial information about the number of variants circulating in an outbreak and the possible lines of transmission but sequencing every positive SARS-CoV-2 sample would be prohibitively costly for population-scale test and trace operations. Genotyping is a rapid, high-throughput and low-cost alternative for screening positive SARS-CoV-2 samples in many settings. We have designed a SNP identification pipeline to identify genetic variation using sequenced SARS-CoV-2 samples. Our pipeline identifies a minimal marker panel that can define distinct genotypes. To evaluate the system, we developed a genotyping panel to detect variants-identified from SARS-CoV-2 sequences surveyed between March and May 2020 and tested this on 50 stored qRT-PCR positive SARS-CoV-2 clinical samples that had been collected across the South West of the UK in April 2020. The 50 samples split into 15 distinct genotypes and there was a 61.9% probability that any two randomly chosen samples from our set of 50 would have a distinct genotype. In a high throughput laboratory, qRT-PCR positive samples pooled into 384-well plates could be screened with a marker panel at a cost of &lt; £1.50 per sample. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of a SNP genotyping panel to provide a rapid, cost-effective, and reliable way to monitor SARS-CoV-2 variants circulating in an outbreak. Our analysis pipeline is publicly available and will allow for marker panels to be updated periodically as viral genotypes arise or disappear from circulation."
https://openalex.org/W3129736019,"This article investigates the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on electoral participation. We study the French municipal elections that took place at the very beginning of the ongoing pandemic and held in over 9,000 municipalities on March 15, 2020. In addition to the simple note that turnout rates decreased to a historically low level, we establish a robust relationship between the depressed turnout rate and the disease. Using various estimation strategies and employing a large number of potential confounding factors, we find that the participation rate decreases with city proximity to COVID-19 clusters. Furthermore, the proximity has conditioned impacts according to the proportion of elderly –who are the most threatened– within the city. Cities with higher population density, where the risk of infection is higher, and cities where only one list ran at the election, which dramatically reduces competitiveness, experienced differentiated effects of distance."
https://openalex.org/W3130780865,"Computational approaches for drug discovery, such as quantitative structure-activity relationship, rely on structural similarities of small molecules to infer biological activity but are often limited to identifying new drug candidates in the chemical spaces close to known ligands. Here we report a biological activity-based modeling (BABM) approach, in which compound activity profiles established across multiple assays are used as signatures to predict compound activity in other assays or against a new target. This approach was validated by identifying candidate antivirals for Zika and Ebola viruses based on high-throughput screening data. BABM models were then applied to predict 311 compounds with potential activity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Of the predicted compounds, 32% had antiviral activity in a cell culture live virus assay, the most potent compounds showing a half-maximal inhibitory concentration in the nanomolar range. Most of the confirmed anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds were found to be viral entry inhibitors and/or autophagy modulators. The confirmed compounds have the potential to be further developed into anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies."
https://openalex.org/W3132765994,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and social interaction and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. Given the lack of specific pharmacological therapy for ASD and the clinical heterogeneity of the disorder, current biomarker research efforts are geared mainly toward identifying markers for determining ASD risk or for assisting with a diagnosis. A wide range of putative biological markers for ASD is currently being investigated. Proteomic analyses indicate that the levels of many proteins in plasma/serum are altered in ASD, suggesting that a panel of proteins may provide a blood biomarker for ASD. Serum samples from 76 boys with ASD and 78 typically developing (TD) boys, 18 months-8 years of age, were analyzed to identify possible early biological markers for ASD. Proteomic analysis of serum was performed using SomaLogic’s SOMAScan TM assay 1.3K platform. A total of 1,125 proteins were analyzed. There were 86 downregulated proteins and 52 upregulated proteins in ASD (FDR &lt; 0.05). Combining three different algorithms, we found a panel of 9 proteins that identified ASD with an area under the curve (AUC) = 0.8599±0.0640, with specificity and sensitivity of 0.8217±0.1178 and 0.835±0.1176, respectively. All 9 proteins were significantly different in ASD compared with TD boys, and were significantly correlated with ASD severity as measured by ADOS total scores. Using machine learning methods, a panel of serum proteins was identified that may be useful as a blood biomarker for ASD in boys. Further verification of the protein biomarker panel with independent test sets is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W3132507003,"Infant and maternal mortality are important indicators for assessing the quality of healthcare systems. The World Health Organization underscores the importance of proper health care system in reducing preventable mortality through early intervention. Early intervention includes availability, accessibility and affordability of health care systems for children and mothers. While there are several studies that assess the immediate and underlying drivers of child mortality, literature on the role of policy measures are limited and inconsistent. Thus, robust empirical analysis of the determinants of maternal and infant mortality remains inconclusive in the era of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Here, we examined the influence of health expenditure on infant and maternal deaths for the period 2000–2015 across 177 countries. Using panel Quantile Regression with bootstrapping, this study accounted for the 2007–2008 financial crisis in an empirical relationship between health outcome and health expenditure. We found a negative effect of health expenditure on mortality across all percentiles. Infant mortality rate declines between 0.19% - 1.45% while maternal mortality rate declines ranging from 0.09% - 1.91%. To attain the goal of ensuring healthy lives and wellbeing of all people (SDG 3), this study infers that health expenditure potentially reduces maternal and infant mortality across lower and middle income countries. We highlight the need for an enhanced health care expenditure, especially in developing countries to curb the levels of infant and maternal deaths."
https://openalex.org/W3131965602,"A study involving over 2000 online participants (US residents) tested a general framework regarding compliance with a directive in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study featured not only a self-report measure of social distancing but also virtual behavior measures—simulations that presented participants with graphical depictions mirroring multiple real-world scenarios and asked them to position themselves in relation to others in the scene. The conceptual framework highlights three essential components of a directive: (1) the source, some entity is advocating for a behavioral change; (2) the surrounding context, the directive is in response to some challenge; and (3) the target, the persons to whom the directive is addressed. Belief systems relevant to each of these three components are predicted, and were found, to relate to compliance with the social distancing directive. The implications of the findings for public service campaigns encouraging people to engage in social distancing are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3130825974,"Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the putative functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Current literature on the abundance and distribution of ACE2 protein in the human respiratory tract is controversial. We examined the effect of age and lung injury on ACE2 protein expression in rodent and non-human primate (NHP) models. We also examined ACE2 expression in human tissues with and without coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). ACE2 expression was detected at very low levels in preterm, but was absent in full-term and adult NHP lung homogenates. This pattern of ACE2 expression contrasted with that of transmembrane protease serine type 2 (TMPRSS2), which was significantly increased in full-term newborn and adult NHP lungs compared to preterm NHP lungs. ACE2 expression was not detected in NHP lungs with cigarette smoke-induced airway disease or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Murine lungs lacked basal ACE2 immunoreactivity, but responded to hyperoxia, bacterial infection, and allergen exposure with new ACE2 expression in bronchial epithelial cells. In human specimens, robust ACE2 immunoreactivity was detected in ciliated epithelial cells in paranasal sinus specimens, while ACE2 expression was detected only in rare type 2 alveolar epithelial cells in control lungs. In autopsy specimens from patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, ACE2 was detected in rare ciliated epithelial and endothelial cells in the trachea, but not in the lung. There was robust expression of ACE2 expression in F344/N rat nasal mucosa and lung specimens, which authentically recapitulated the ACE2 expression pattern in human paranasal sinus specimens. Thus, ACE2 protein expression demonstrates a significant gradient between upper and lower respiratory tract in humans and is scarce in the lung. This pattern of ACE2 expression supports the notion of sinonasal epithelium being the main entry site for SARS-CoV-2 but raises further questions on the pathogenesis and cellular targets of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19 pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W3130087348,"The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had an immense impact on world health and daily life in many countries. Sturdy observing of the initial site of infection in patients is crucial to gain control in the struggle with COVID-19. The early automated detection of the recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) will help to limit its dissemination worldwide. Many initial studies have focused on the identification of the genetic material of coronavirus and have a poor detection rate for long-term surgery. The first imaging procedure that played an important role in COVID-19 treatment was the chest X-ray. Radiological imaging is often used as a method that emphasizes the performance of chest X-rays. Recent findings indicate the presence of COVID-19 in patients with irregular findings on chest X-rays. There are many reports on this topic that include machine learning strategies for the identification of COVID-19 using chest X-rays. Other current studies have used non-public datasets and complex artificial intelligence (AI) systems. In our research, we suggested a new COVID-19 identification technique based on the locality-weighted learning and self-organization map (LWL-SOM) strategy for detecting and capturing COVID-19 cases. We first grouped images from chest X-ray datasets based on their similar features in different clusters using the SOM strategy in order to discriminate between the COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 cases. Then, we built our intelligent learning model based on the LWL algorithm to diagnose and detect COVID-19 cases. The proposed SOM-LWL model improved the correlation coefficient performance results between the Covid19, no-finding, and pneumonia cases; pneumonia and no-finding cases; Covid19 and pneumonia cases; and Covid19 and no-finding cases from 0.9613 to 0.9788, 0.6113 to 1 0.8783 to 0.9999, and 0.8894 to 1, respectively. The proposed LWL-SOM had better results for discriminating COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients than the current machine learning-based solutions using AI evaluation measures."
https://openalex.org/W3132676333,"Background Multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) is characterized by widespread symptoms attributed to exposure to airborne chemicals. MCS is categorized as a functional somatic syndrome (FSS), and MCS cases often meet the criteria for other types of FSS, e.g. fibromyalgia. The primary aim was to characterize MCS regarding symptom triggers, symptoms, lifestyle and describe demographics, socioeconomics and lifestyle factors associated with MCS. A secondary aim was to examine the implication of FSS comorbidity. Methods Data were derived from a random sample of the Danish adult population enrolled in the Danish Study of Functional Disorders (DanFunD; n = 9,656). Questionnaire data comprised information used to delimit MCS and four additional types of FSS, as well as data on demographics, socioeconomics and lifestyle. MCS cases (n = 188) was stratified into subgroups; MCS only (n = 109) and MCS with comorbid FSS (n = 73). Information regarding FSS comorbidities were missing for six MCS cases. MCS subgroups and controls without FSS comorbidities (n = 7,791) were compared by means of logistic regression analyses, adjusted for age and sex. Results MCS was associated with female sex, not being in occupation and low social status, but not with age or education. MCS cases reported normal dietary intake and smoking habits and lower alcohol consumption. Additional associations were found between MCS and low rate of cohabitation, sedentarism, daily physically limitations, and poor quality of sleep. However, subgroup analysis revealed that these findings were primarily associated with MCS with comorbid FSS. Conclusions MCS was associated with lower socioeconomic status, physically inactivity and poor quality of sleep. Subgroup analysis revealed that several associations was explained by FSS comorbidity, i.e. MCS cases with no comorbid FSS showed normal rate of cohabitation and did not report physical limitations or difficulties sleeping. Overall, our findings emphasise the importance of screening MCS cases for FSS comorbidity both in epidemiological and clinical settings."
https://openalex.org/W3132556877,"To investigate the role of tannin-enriched extracts of Ecklonia cava (TEE) on the regulation of oxidative balance and laxative activity in chronic constipation, we investigated alterations after exposure to TEE, on constipation phenotypes, muscarinic cholinergic regulation, and oxidative stress responses in the transverse colons of SD rats with loperamide (Lop)-induced constipation. This extract contains high levels of total condensed tannin content (326.5 mg/g), and exhibited high inhibitory activity against 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radicals. TEE treatment induced significant improvements in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) phosphorylation in primary smooth muscles of rat intestine cells (pRISMCs) and transverse colon of constipation model. Also, Lop+TEE treated groups showed alleviated outcomes for the following: most stool parameters, gastrointestinal transit, and intestine length were remarkably recovered; a similar recovery pattern was observed in the histopathological structure, mucin secretion, water channel expression and gastrointestinal hormones secretion in the transverse colon; expressions of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors M2/M3 (mAChR M2/M3) and their mediators on muscarinic cholinergic regulation were significantly recovered. Taken together, these results provide the first evidence that TEE stimulates oxidative stress modulation and muscarinic cholinergic regulation when exerting its laxative effects in chronic constipation models."
https://openalex.org/W3130536572,"Bile acid has attracted attention as a signal transmission molecule in energy metabolism. Although a high-fat diet (HFD) or obesity is known to increase hepatic fat content and alter bile acid composition, the changes in bile acid composition due to HFD or obesity remain to be elucidated. We sought to examine the bile acid composition in high fat diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in obese diabetic rats. Eight-week-old male spontaneously diabetic Torii fatty (SDTF) rats or control rats were fed an HFD. Twelve weeks post the commencement of HFD, serum and hepatic bile acid compositions and serum GLP-1 levels, which is stimulated by the secondary bile acid deoxycholic acid (DCA), were measured. The correlation between the bile acid composition and serum GLP-1 levels was also examined. While serum and hepatic levels of cholic acid (CA), a primary bile acid, tended to decrease in HFD-fed control rats, they were significantly decreased in HFD-fed SDTF rats. Hepatic CYP8B1, which plays a role in CA synthesis, the mRNA levels were significantly decreased in HFD-fed control and SDTF rats. In contrast, while serum and hepatic DCA levels were not changed in HFD-fed control rats, they were decreased in HFD-fed SDTF rats. Hepatic DCA/CA did not change in HFD-fed SDTF rats, but significantly increased in HFD-fed control rats. While serum GLP-1 levels were not changed in SDTF rats, they were significantly increased in HFD-fed control rats. Hepatic DCA/CA tended to correlate with serum GLP-1 levels, which tended to negatively correlate with the hepatic triglyceride content in SDTF rats. These results indicate that relatively increased DCA might contribute to an increase in serum GLP-1 levels, which inhibits hepatic steatosis in NAFLD."
https://openalex.org/W3131064511,"Climate change will be a powerful stressor on ecosystems and biodiversity in the second half of the 21 st century. In this study, we used the satellite-derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) to examine a 34-year trend along with the response of vegetation to climate indicators surrounding the world’s largest megacity: the Pearl River Delta (PRD) of China. An overall increasing trend is observed in vegetation productivity metrics over the study period 1982 to 2015. Increase in winter productivity in both natural ecosystems and croplands is more related to increasing temperatures (r = 0.5–0.78), than to changes in rainfall. For growing season productivity, negative correlations with temperature were observed in cropland regions, and some forests in the northern part of PRD region, suggesting high-temperature stress on crop production and forest vegetation. However, increased winter and spring temperatures provide higher opportunities for cropping in winter. During the decade 1995–2004, vegetation productivity metrics showed a reversal in the upward trend. The geographical and biological complexity of the region under significant climatic and development impacts suggests causative factors would be synergistic. These include our observed decrease in sunshine hours, increasing cloud cover associated with atmospheric aerosols from industrial and urban development, direct pollution effects on plant growth, and exceedance of high temperature growth thresholds."
https://openalex.org/W3131697787,"Yellowfin tuna (YFT, Thunnus albacares ) is a commercially important species targeted by fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico (GM). Previous studies suggest a high degree of residency in the northern GM, although part of the population performs movements to southern Mexican waters. Whether YFT caught in southern waters also exhibit residency or migrate to the northern gulf is currently uncertain, and little is known regarding their trophic ecology. The isotopic composition (bulk &amp; amino acids) of YFT muscle and liver tissues were compared to a zooplankton-based synoptic isoscape from the entire GM to infer feeding areas and estimate Trophic Position (TP). The spatial distribution of δ 15 N bulk and δ 15 N Phe values of zooplankton indicated two distinct isotopic baselines: one with higher values in the northern GM likely driven by denitrification over the continental shelf, and another in the central-southern gulf, where nitrogen fixation predominates. Based on the contribution of the two regional isotopic baselines to YFT tissues, broad feeding areas were inferred, with a greater contribution of the northern GM (over a one-year time scale by muscle), and to a lesser extent in the central-southern GM (over the ca. 6-month scale by liver). This was corroborated by similarities in δ 15 N Phe values between YFT and the northern GM. TP estimates were calculated based on stable isotope analysis of bulk (SIA) and compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA-AA) of the canonical source and trophic amino acids. Mean TP based on SIA was 4.9 ± 1.0 and mean TP based on CSIA-A was 3.9 ± 0.2. YFT caught within the Mexican region seem to feed in northern and in central and southern GM, while feeding in the northern GM has a temporal component. Thus, management strategies need to consider that YFT caught in US and Mexican waters are a shared binational resource that exhibit feeding migrations within the GM."

Yet there have been few studies of the molecular response of passion fruit to virus attack. In the present study, RNA-based transcriptional profiling (RNA-seq) was used to identify the gene expression profiles in yellow passion fruit ( Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa ) leaves following inoculation with cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). Six RNA-seq libraries were constructed comprising a total of 42.23 Gb clean data. 1,545 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were obtained (701 upregulated and 884 downregulated). Gene annotation analyses revealed that genes associated with plant hormone signal transduction, transcription factors, protein ubiquitination, detoxification, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, photosynthesis and chlorophyll metabolism were significantly affected by CMV infection. The represented genes activated by CMV infection corresponded to transcription factors WRKY family, NAC family, protein ubiquitination and peroxidase. Several DEGs encoding protein TIFY, pathogenesis-related proteins, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerases also were upregualted by CMV infection. Overall, the information obtained in this study enriched the resources available for research into the molecular-genetic mechanisms of the passion fruit/CMV interaction, and might provide a theoretical basis for the prevention and management of passion fruit viral disease in the field."

Sphingomyelin synthase (SMS)-related protein (SMSr) produces DG and ceramide phosphoethanolamine (CPE) by the transfer of phosphoethanolamine from phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to ceramide. We previously reported that human SMSr overexpressed in COS-7 cells significantly increased DG levels, particularly saturated and/or monounsaturated fatty acid–containing DG molecular species, and provided DG to DG kinase (DGK) δ, which regulates various pathophysiological events, including epidermal growth factor–dependent cell proliferation, type 2 diabetes, and obsessive–compulsive disorder. However, mammalian SMSr puzzlingly produces only trace amounts of CPE/DG. To clarify this discrepancy, we highly purified SMSr and examined its activities other than CPE synthase. Intriguingly, purified SMSr showed a DG-generating activity via hydrolysis of PE, phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidylcholine (PC) in the absence of ceramide. DG generation through the PA phosphatase (PAP) activity of SMSr was approximately 300-fold higher than that with PE and ceramide.

Sphingomyelin synthase (SMS) is a DG-generating enzyme (17Taniguchi M. Okazaki T.

The SMS1 and SMS2 proteins generate DG and SM via the transfer of phosphocholine from PC to ceramide (Table 1). SMSr is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident, six-transmembrane protein and has no SMS activity but displays ceramide phosphoethanolamine (CPE) synthase (CPES) activity via the transfer of phosphoethanolamine from PE to ceramide (20Vacaru A.M.

In particular, the levels of saturated fatty acid (SFA)- and/or monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA)-containing PA species, including 16:1/16:1-PA, 16:0/16:1-PA, 16:0/16:0-PA, 16:1/18:1-PA, and 16:0/18:1-PA, which were also produced by DGKδ in high-glucose-stimulated C2C12 myoblast cells (31Sakai H.

Furthermore, SMSr overexpressed in COS-7 cells generated SFA- and/or MUFA-containing DG species. Therefore, it is possible that SMSr acts upstream of DGKδ and provides SFA- and/or MUFA-containing DG.

These contradictory results prompted us to postulate that SMSr possesses other DG-generating activity in addition to CPES activity. Here, we report that human SMSr, which was expressed in Sf9 cells and is highly purified, displayed DG-generating activity via hydrolysis of PA, PI, PE, and PC in the absence of ceramide. The PAP, PI-phospholipase C (PLC), PE-PLC, and PC-PLC activities were much stronger than the CPES activity (∼300-fold, ∼10-fold, ∼4-fold, and ∼3-fold, respectively). Intriguingly, SMSr exhibited a substrate specificity for SFA- and/or MUFA-containing PA and PC molecular species, but not polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA)-containing PA and PC. Taken together, we revealed the previously unrecognized enzyme activities of mammalian SMSr, novel PAP, PI-PLC, PE-PLC, and PC-PLC activities, to produce SFA and/or MUFA-containing DG molecular species independent of ceramide in the ER membrane. To determine whether SMSr possesses other DG-generating activity in addition to CPES activity, we first expressed N-terminal hexahistidine (6×His)-tagged human full-length (FL) SMSr and SMSr-ΔSAMD, which lacks an oligomer formation domain, SAMD (32Cabukusta B. Köhlen J.A. Richter C.P. You C. Holthuis J.C. Monitoring changes in the oligomeric state of a candidate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ceramide sensor by single-molecule photobleaching.J. Biol.

Rep. 2017; 7: 41290Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), in Sf9 cells and purified them from Sf9 cell membranes using Ni-affinity chromatography (Fig. 1A). SMSr-ΔSAMD showed no significant difference in DG production levels compared with FL-SMSr (Fig. 1B). However, the SMSr-ΔSAMD yield was approximately six-fold higher than that of FL-SMSr (data not shown). Therefore, we employed SMSr-ΔSAMD for further investigation. Next, to further purify 6× His-SMSr-ΔSAMD, size-exclusion chromatography was conducted after Ni-affinity chromatography. SMSr-ΔSAMD was eluted as a single peak in a volume of 13.9 ml (∼56.1 kDa) (Fig. 2A). Thus, the purified 6× His-SMSr-ΔSAMD is likely to be a monomer because its calculated molecular mass is 40.8 kDa (SMSr-ΔSAMD: 39.2 kDa +6×His: 1.6 kDa). Immunoblotting and silver staining showed that a single protein band at approximately 40 kDa was detected (Fig. 2B), indicating that 6× His-SMSr-ΔSAMD was obtained with a high purity. The yield was ∼6 μg per 1 L of an Sf9 cell culture. We confirmed that the purified SMSr-ΔSAMD slightly produced DG in the presence of PE and ceramide micelles (Fig. 2C). However, the DG-generating activity was exceedingly low (∼3 pmol/mg/min). Moreover, only trace amounts of CPE were generated by the purified SMSr-ΔSAMD (Fig. 2D). To test whether SMSr-ΔSAMD hydrolyzes other phospholipids, we compared the hydrolysis activity of 10 μl (0.03 μg/μl) of purified SMSr-ΔSAMD against various phospholipids (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl (16:0/18:1)-PA, 16:0/18:1-PC, 16:0/18:1-PE, 16:0/18:1-PG, 16:0/18:1-PI and 16:0/18:1-PS) in vitro by incubating the substrate micelle mixture followed by quantitation of the produced DG levels using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) (30Murakami C.

Development of a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry based enzyme activity assay for phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C.Anal.

Compared with the DG-generating activity in the presence of ceramide and 16:0/18:1-PE (substrates for CPES), SMSr showed a much more intensive PAP activity (∼340-fold), even in the absence of ceramide. The enzyme also has stronger PI-PLC (∼12-fold), PE-PLC (∼4-fold), PC-PLC (∼3-fold), and PG-PLC (∼1.5-fold) activities. However, the PS hydrolysis activity of SMSr was not detectable. To further investigate the selectivity of SMSr for phosphoinositides, we compared the hydrolysis activities of purified SMSr-ΔSAMD against 18:0/20:4-PI and 18:0/20:4-PI(4,5)P2 (Fig. 3B). The enzyme showed a ten-fold stronger PI-PLC activity than the PI(4,5)P2-PLC activity. This result indicates that the catalytic selectivity for the phosphoinositides of SMSr is opposite to that of mammalian PI-PLC (PI(4,5)P2-PLC), which hydrolyzes PI(4,5)P2 much more strongly than PI (PI(4,5)P2:PI = 50:1) (Table 2) (35Meldrum E.

A theoretical model is proposed, which explains the effects of festival attributes on satisfaction and loyalty through structural equation modelling. The model was estimated with a sample of 440 people attending Weekend Beach Festival in Spain. The research proves the relationship between attributes and loyalty through satisfaction as a moderating variable; likewise, tangible attributes are deemed to have a greater influence on loyalty, specifically, the aesthetic/environment experience."

This allows tests specifically useful for this pandemic to trade-off unneeded sensitivity for necessary speed, simplicity, and frugality. In some studies, it was shown that viral load that creates forward-infection risk may exceed 10 5 virions per milliliter, easily within the sensitivity of an RNA amplification architecture, but unattainable by antibody-based architectures that simply target viral antigens. Here, we describe such a test based on a displaceable probe loop amplification architecture."

With our study we aimed to understand the diffusion of the infection by mass serological screening. We searched for SARS-CoV-2 IgGs in the entire population on a voluntary basis using lateral flow immunochromatographic tests (RICT) on capillary blood (rapid tests). We then performed chemioluminescent serological assays (CLIA) and naso-pharyngeal swabs (NPS) in a randomized representative sample and in each subject with a positive rapid test. Factors associated with RICT IgG positivity were assessed by uni- and multivariate logistic regression models. Out of the 4143 participants, 918 (22·2%) showed RICT IgG positivity. In multivariable analysis, IgG positivity increases with age, with a significant non-linear effect (p = 0·0404). We found 22 positive NPSs out of the 1330 performed. Albeit relevant, the IgG prevalence is lower than expected and suggests that a large part of the population remains susceptible to the infection. The observed differences in prevalence might reflect a different infection susceptibility by age group. A limited persistence of active infections could be found after several weeks after the epidemic peak in the area."
https://openalex.org/W3133397799,"Background This study aimed to evaluate the association between intraoperative blood loss and myocardial injury after non-cardiac surgery (MINS), which is a severe and common postoperative complication. Methods We compared the incidence of MINS based on significant intraoperative bleeding, defined as an absolute hemoglobin level &lt; 7 g/dL, a relative hemoglobin level less than 50% of the preoperative measurement, or need for packed red cell transfusion. We also estimated a threshold for intraoperative hemoglobin level associated with MINS. Results We stratified a total of 15,926 non-cardiac surgical patients with intraoperative hemoglobin and postoperative cardiac troponin (cTn) measurements according to the occurrence of significant intraoperative bleeding; 13,416 (84.2%) had no significant bleeding while 2,510 (15.8%) did have significant bleeding. After an adjustment with inverse probability weighting, the incidence of MINS was higher in the significant bleeding group (35.2% vs. 16.4%; odds ratio, 1.58; 95% confidence interval, 1.43–1.75; p &lt; 0.001). The threshold of intraoperative hemoglobin associated with MINS was estimated to be 9.9 g/dL with an area under the curve of 0.643. Conclusion Intraoperative blood loss appeared to be associated with MINS. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings. Clinical registration The cohort was registered before patient enrollment at https://cris.nih.go.kr (KCT0004244)."
https://openalex.org/W3130541837,"Outgroup threat has been identified as an important driver of ingroup cohesion in humans, but the evolutionary origin of such a relationship is unclear. Chimpanzees ( Pan troglodytes ) in the wild are notably aggressive towards outgroup members but coordinate complex behaviors with many individuals in group hunting and border patrols. One hypothesis claims that these behaviors evolve alongside one another, where outgroup threat selects for ingroup cohesion and group coordination. To test this hypothesis, 5 groups of chimpanzees (N = 29 individuals) were observed after hearing either pant-hoots of unfamiliar wild chimpanzees or control crow vocalizations both in their typical daily environment and in a context of induced feeding competition. We observed a behavioral pattern that was consistent both with increased stress and vigilance (self-directed behaviors increased, play decreased, rest decreased) and increased ingroup cohesion (interindividual proximity decreased, aggression over food decreased, and play during feeding competition increased). These results support the hypothesis that outgroup threat elicits ingroup tolerance in chimpanzees. This suggests that in chimpanzees, like humans, competition between groups fosters group cohesion."
https://openalex.org/W3130572446,"Rearing habitat for juvenile Chinook Salmon ( Oncorhynchus tshawytscha ) in California, the southernmost portion of their range, has drastically declined throughout the past century. Recently, through cooperative agreements with diverse stakeholders, winter-flooded agricultural rice fields in California’s Central Valley have emerged as ecologically functioning floodplain rearing habitat for juvenile Chinook Salmon. From 2013 to 2016, we conducted a series of experiments examining methods to enhance habitat benefits for fall-run Chinook Salmon reared on winter-flooded rice fields in the Yolo Bypass, a modified floodplain managed for flood control, agriculture, and wildlife habitat in the Sacramento River Valley of California. Investigations included studying the effect of 1) post-harvest field substrate; 2) depth refugia; 3) duration of field drainage; and 4) duration of rearing occupancy on in-situ diet, growth and survival of juvenile salmon. Post-harvest substrate treatment had only a small effect on the lower trophic food web and an insignificant effect on growth rates or survival of rearing hatchery-origin, fall-run Chinook Salmon. Similarly, depth refugia, created by trenches dug to various depths, also had an insignificant effect on survival. Rapid field drainage yielded significantly higher survival compared to drainage methods drawn out over longer periods. A mortality of approximately one third was observed in the first week after fish were released in the floodplain. This initial mortality event was followed by high, stable survival rates for the remainder of the 6-week duration of floodplain rearing study. Across years, in-field survival ranged 7.4–61.6% and increased over the course of the experiments. Despite coinciding with the most extreme drought in California’s recorded history, which elevated water temperatures and reduced the regional extent of adjacent flooded habitats which concentrated avian predators, the adaptive research framework enabled incremental improvements in design to increase survival. Zooplankton (fish food) in the winter-flooded rice fields were 53-150x more abundant than those sampled concurrently in the adjacent Sacramento River channel. Correspondingly, observed somatic growth rates of juvenile hatchery-sourced fall-run Chinook Salmon stocked in rice fields were two to five times greater than concurrently and previously observed growth rates in the adjacent Sacramento River. The abundance of food resources and exceptionally high growth rates observed during these experiments illustrate the potential benefits of using existing agricultural infrastructure to approximate the floodplain wetland physical conditions and hydrologic patterns (shallow, long-duration inundation of cool floodplain habitats in mid-winter) under which Chinook Salmon evolved and to which they are adapted."
https://openalex.org/W3191203532,"The intramuscular fat (IMF) content and fatty acid composition are important meat quality traits that are mostly affected by the cattle breed. Muscle, adipose tissue and liver are important organs involved in the development of intramuscular adipose tissue. Thus, we hypothesized that there were marked differences in the adipogenesis and lipid metabolism of these tissues between Wagyu-cross and Holstein steers during the finishing phases. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the expression levels of adipogenesis- and lipid metabolism-related genes in longissimus muscle (LM), subcutaneous fat (SCF) and liver from Wagyu-cross and Holstein steers at 26 months of age. The IMF content and fatty acid profile of LM were determined. Wagyu-cross steers had a higher IMF content and MUFA percentages in the LM than Holstein steers ( P &lt;0.05). The relative expression of FGF2 , COL1A1 , SREBP1c , SCD1 , GRP78 and LEP was greater in the LM of Wagyu-cross steers than in Holstein steers ( P &lt;0.05). In contrast, Holstein steer SCF had higher ( P &lt;0.05) mRNA expression levels of FABP4 and ADIPOQ than Wagyu-cross steers. In the liver, the expression of SREBP1c and GRP78 in Wagyu-cross steers was significantly higher than that in Holstein steers ( P &lt;0.05). The results demonstrate that both intramuscular adipogenesis and fibrogenesis are enhanced in Wagyu-cross steers compared with Holstein steers during the finishing phase and that IMF deposition is positively correlated with the maturity of SCF and hepatic lipid accumulation in Wagyu-cross steers."
https://openalex.org/W3130082344,"Human activity is organised around daily and weekly cycles, which should, in turn, dominate all types of social interactions, such as transactions, communications, gatherings and so on. Yet, despite their strategic importance for policing and security, cyclical weekly patterns in crime and road incidents have been unexplored at the city and neighbourhood level. Here we construct a novel method to capture the weekly trace, or “heartbeat” of events and use geotagged data capturing the time and location of more than 200,000 violent crimes and nearly one million crashes in Mexico City. On aggregate, our findings show that the heartbeats of crime and crashes follow a similar pattern. We observe valleys during the night and peaks in the evening, where the intensity during a peak is 7.5 times the intensity of valleys in terms of crime and 12.3 times in terms of road accidents. Although distinct types of events, crimes and crashes reach their respective intensity peak on Friday night and valley on Tuesday morning, the result of a hyper-synchronised society. Next, heartbeats are computed for city neighbourhood ‘tiles’, a division of space within the city based on the distance to Metro and other public transport stations. We find that heartbeats are spatially heterogeneous with some diffusion, so that nearby tiles have similar heartbeats. Tiles are then clustered based on the shape of their heartbeat, e.g., tiles within groups suffer peaks and valleys of crime or crashes at similar times during the week. The clusters found are similar to those based on economic activities. This enables us to anticipate temporal traces of crime and crashes based on local amenities."
https://openalex.org/W3129321984,"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) is expressed in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) including oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) and is a potential therapeutic target. However, information on its correlation with other relevant cancer related proteins stratified by p16 status and its prognostic significance in OPSCC is limited. We examined FGFR3 expression and its correlation with clinical characteristics, p16 status, and mutant p53 (mp53) among 220 retrospectively collected OPSCC cases and 40 prospectively collected SCCHN cases, including a majority of OPSCC. Correlations of FGFR3 Weighted Index (WI) with p16 status and mp53 WI as well as its association with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. FGFR3 expression was detected in 61% and 70% of cases in cohorts 1 and 2, respectively. FGFR3 level was significantly higher in p16-negative tumors in both cohorts (p&lt;0.001 and 0.006). FGFR3 expression was highly correlated with mp53 expression in both p16 + and p16– OPSCC (p&lt;0.0001 and p = 0.0006, respectively). In cohort 1, univariate analysis showed that FGFR3 was associated with DFS but not OS. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that higher FGFR3 and mp53 level correlated with worse DFS (p = 0.025) and OS (p = 0.009). As expected, p16 positive status was associated with improved OS and DFS (p&lt;0.001 for both). Our results suggest that high FGFR3 expression is associated with p16 negative status and mp53 expression in OPSCC and correlates with a worse clinical outcome. The biological relationship between FGFR3 and mp53 in OPSCC deserves further investigation."

Phylogenetic analysis places the new taxon within the diplodocoid clade Rebbachisauridae. This is the first rebbachisaurid reported from Asia and one of the youngest rebbachisaurids in the known fossil record. The caudal is characterized by a slightly opisthocoelous centrum, ‘wing-like’ transverse processes with large but shallow PRCDF and POCDF, and the absence of a hyposphenal ridge and of TPRL and TPOL. The neural spine has high SPRL, SPDL, SPOL, and POSL and is pneumatized. The apex of neural spine is transversely expanded and bears triangular lateral processes. The new taxon shares with Demandasaurus and the Wessex rebbachisaurid a high SPDL on the lateral side of the neural spine, separated from SPRL and SPOL. This possibly suggests derivation of Dzharatitanis from European rebbachisaurids. This is the second sauropod group identified in the assemblage of non-avian dinosaurs from the Bissekty Formation, in addition to a previously identified indeterminate titanosaurian."
https://openalex.org/W3133094892,"There is a widespread cross-cultural stereotype suggesting that atheists are untrustworthy and lack a moral compass. Is there any truth to this notion? Building on theory about the cultural, (de)motivational, and cognitive antecedents of disbelief, the present research investigated whether there are reliable similarities as well as differences between believers and disbelievers in the moral values and principles they endorse. Four studies examined how religious disbelief (vs. belief) relates to endorsement of various moral values and principles in a predominately religious (vs. irreligious) country (the U.S. vs. Sweden). Two U.S. M-Turk studies (Studies 1A and 1B, N = 429) and two large cross-national studies (Studies 2–3, N = 4,193), consistently show that disbelievers (vs. believers) are less inclined to endorse moral values that serve group cohesion (the binding moral foundations). By contrast, only minor differences between believers and disbelievers were found in endorsement of other moral values (individualizing moral foundations, epistemic rationality). It is also demonstrated that presumed cultural and demotivational antecedents of disbelief (limited exposure to credibility-enhancing displays, low existential threat) are associated with disbelief. Furthermore, these factors are associated with weaker endorsement of the binding moral foundations in both countries (Study 2). Most of these findings were replicated in Study 3, and results also show that disbelievers (vs. believers) have a more consequentialist view of morality in both countries. A consequentialist view of morality was also associated with another presumed antecedent of disbelief—analytic cognitive style."

In addition, molecular docking was used to check their binding affinities for homology modelled P . falciparum N-myristoyltransferase, a confirmed drug target in the pathogen. Results revealed that sixteen new derivatives killed the parasite at single-digit micromolar concentration (IC 50 = 2.40–8.30 μM) and compounds 10b , 10c , 10d , 10j and 10o scavenged DPPH radicals at IC 50 s (6.48, 8.49, 3.02, 6.44 and 4.32 μg/mL respectively) comparable with 1.06 μg/mL for ascorbic acid.

https://openalex.org/W3131895982,"Soundscape ecology is an emerging field in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, and provides a powerful approach for assessing habitat quality and the ecological response of sound-producing species to natural and anthropogenic perturbations. Little is known of how underwater soundscapes respond during and after severe episodic disturbances, such as hurricanes. This study addresses the impacts of Hurricane Irma on the coral reef soundscape at two spur-and-groove fore-reef sites within the Florida Keys USA, using passive acoustic data collected before and during the storm at Western Dry Rocks (WDR) and before, during and after the storm at Eastern Sambo (ESB). As the storm passed, the cumulative acoustic exposure near the seabed at these sites was comparable to a small vessel operating continuously overhead for 1–2 weeks. Before the storm, sound pressure levels (SPLs) showed a distinct pattern of low frequency diel variation and increased high frequency sound during crepuscular periods. The low frequency band was partitioned in two groups representative of soniferous reef fish, whereas the high frequency band represented snapping shrimp sound production. Daily daytime patterns in low-frequency sound production largely persisted in the weeks following the hurricane. Crepuscular sound production by snapping shrimp was maintained post-hurricane with only a small shift (~1.5dB) in the level of daytime vs nighttime sound production for this high frequency band. This study suggests that on short time scales, temporal patterns in the coral reef soundscape were relatively resilient to acoustic energy exposure during the storm, as well as changes in the benthic habitat and environmental conditions resulting from hurricane damage."

https://openalex.org/W3129701018,"Background Gangliosides are a class of sphingolipids that are present in the cell membranes of vertebrates. Gangliosides influence a broad range of cellular processes through effects on signal transduction, being found abundantly in the brain, and having a role in neurodevelopment. Objective We aimed to assess the effects of maternal daily consumption of ganglioside-enriched milk vs non-enriched milk and a non-supplemented group of pregnant women on maternal ganglioside levels and pregnancy outcomes. Design Double-blind parallel randomized controlled trial. Methods 1,500 women aged 20–40 years were recruited in Chongqing (China) between 11 and 14 weeks of a singleton pregnancy, and randomized into three groups: Control–received standard powdered milk formulation (≥4 mg gangliosides/day); Complex milk lipid-enhanced (CML-E) group–same formulation enriched with complex milk lipids (≥8 mg gangliosides/day) from milk fat globule membrane; Reference–received no milk. Serum ganglioside levels were measured in a randomly selected subsample of 250 women per group. Results CML-E milk was associated with marginally greater total gangliosides levels in maternal serum compared to Control (13.02 vs 12.69 μg/ml; p = 0.034) but not to Reference group. CML-E milk did not affect cord blood ganglioside levels. Among the 1500 women, CML-E milk consumption was associated with a lower rate of gestational diabetes mellitus than control milk [relative risk 0.80 (95% CI 0.64, 0.99)], but which was not different to the Reference group. CML-E milk supplementation had no other effects on maternal or newborn health. Conclusions Maternal supplementation with milk fat globule membrane, as a source of gangliosides, was not associated with any adverse health outcomes, and did not increase serum gangliosides compared with the non-supplemented reference group.

https://openalex.org/W3129702472,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by a polyglutamine repeat expansion in the ATXN7 gene. Patients with this disease suffer from a degeneration of their cerebellar Purkinje neurons and retinal photoreceptors that result in a progressive ataxia and loss of vision. As with many neurodegenerative diseases, studies of pathogenesis have been hindered by a lack of disease-relevant models. To this end, we have generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from a cohort of SCA7 patients in South Africa. First, we differentiated the SCA7 affected iPSCs into neurons which showed evidence of a transcriptional phenotype affecting components of STAGA (ATXN7 and KAT2A) and the heat shock protein pathway (DNAJA1 and HSP70). We then performed electrophysiology on the SCA7 iPSC-derived neurons and found that these cells show features of functional aberrations. Lastly, we were able to differentiate the SCA7 iPSCs into retinal photoreceptors that also showed similar transcriptional aberrations to the SCA7 neurons. Our findings give technical insights on how iPSC-derived neurons and photoreceptors can be derived from SCA7 patients and demonstrate that these cells express molecular and electrophysiological differences that may be indicative of impaired neuronal health. We hope that these findings will contribute towards the ongoing efforts to establish the cell-derived models of neurodegenerative diseases that are needed to develop patient-specific treatments."

Methods ApoE -/- mice were anesthetized and underwent a T9 laminectomy. Exposed spinal cords were given a contusion injury (70 k-dynes). Sham animals underwent all surgical procedures, excluding injury. Injured animals were randomized to 2 groups: SCI or SCI +Salsalate [120 mg/Kg/day i.p.]. Mice were serially sacrificed at 20-, 24-, and 28-weeks post-SCI, and body mass was recorded. At sacrifice, heart and aorta were harvested intact, fixed in 10% buffered formalin, cleaned and cut longitudinally for en face preparation. The aortic tree was stained with oil-red-O (ORO). AD lesion histomorphometry was calculated from the proportional area of ORO. Plasma total cholesterol, triglycerides and proatherogenic inflammatory cytokines (PAIC’s) were analyzed. Results AD lesion in the aortic arch progressively increased in ApoE -/- , significant at 24- and 28-weeks. AD in SCI is significantly greater at 24- and 28-weeks compared to time-controlled ApoE -/- . Salsalate treatment attenuates the SCI-induced increase at these time points. Body mass in all SCI groups are significantly reduced compared to time-controlled ApoE -/- . Cholesterol and triglycerides are significantly higher with SCI by 24- and 28-weeks, compared to ApoE -/- , and Salsalate reduces the SCI-induced effect on cholesterol. PAIC’s interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 5 (CCL-5) are significantly greater with SCI compared to ApoE -/- at varying timepoints. Salsalate confers a marginal reducing effect on PAIC’s by 28-weeks compared to SCI. Regression models determine that each PAIC is a significant and positive predictor of lesion. (p’s &lt;0.05). Conclusions SCI accelerates aortic AD and associated risk factors, and anti-inflammatory treatment may attenuate the impact of SCI on AD outcomes.

Methods Data were obtained from a nationwide online survey conducted in 2018. The survey included a total of 800 eligible adults aged over 45 years. Study measures included the history of screening colonoscopy within the past 10 years and intentions to undergo primary screening with colonoscopy under the NCSP based on the five constructs of the Health Belief Model. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine factors associated with intentions to undergo primary screening with colonoscopy. Results Approximately 77% of the participants expressed strong willingness to undergo primary screening with colonoscopy under the NCSP. Higher perceived severity and perceived benefits were significantly associated with stronger intentions to undergo screening with colonoscopy (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10–2.14 and aOR, 2.74; 95% CI, 1.76–4.28, respectively). Greater perceived barriers (aOR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.45–0.93) were significantly associated with weaker intentions. Cues to action elicited the strongest screening intentions (aOR, 8.28; 95% CI, 5.23–13.12). Conclusion The current study findings highlight the need for increasing awareness of the severity of CRC and the benefits of colonoscopy screening.

https://openalex.org/W3130180089,"Background There is a potential increase in risk of renal function impairment among patients with invasive cervical cancer (ICC) who are HIV-positive and treated with cisplatin-based concurrent chemoradiation (CCRT). This concern is due to overlapping nephrotoxicity of the drugs, and nephropathy from the diseases themselves. There is limited literature available for the short-term renal outcomes for HIV-positive patients with ICC during routine clinical management. This study aimed to assess if HIV-infection increased the risk of renal impairment in ICC patients treated with CCRT, and explore the respective risk factors. Materials and methods This was a retrospective review of records of ICC patients treated with at least one cycle of weekly cisplatin during CCRT at the Parirenyatwa Radiotherapy Center from January 2017-December 2018. The RIFLE criteria were used to classify renal impairment. Analyses were performed with Fisher’s Exact tests, Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Odds ratios (OR) were generated using logistic regression. All statistical tests were 2-sided at a 5% level of significance. Results Seventy-two eligible patients were identified, 32 (44.44%) were HIV-positive. HIV-positive patients were younger (p = 0.002), had lower albumin levels (p = 0.014) and received lower cisplatin doses (p = 0.044). The mean percent reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from baseline was -19% (95% CI: -25.9% to -13.2%) for all patients. Thirty-one (43.1%) patients experienced renal impairment, 50% and 37.5% of HIV-positive and -negative patients respectively (p = 0.287). HIV-infection was associated with an adjusted OR of 1.16 (95% CI 0.35–3.43, p = 0.769). Baseline eGFR&lt; 60ml/min was the only independent predictor of renal impairment, OR 0.25 (95% CI: 0.07–0.85). Baseline eGFR&lt;60ml/min was also associated with receipt of lower cisplatin doses (p = 0.044). Conclusion HIV-infection was not associated with elevated risk of renal impairment. Patients with an eGFR&lt;60ml/min appear to be managed more cautiously reducing their risk for renal impairment during cisplatin therapy. The high prevalence of renal impairment in this population suggests the need for optimization of pre-treatment protocols."

In Scandinavia, seabirds are at a heightened risk of extinction due to accelerated global warming. Norway is home to significant portion of the European Atlantic Puffin ( Fratercula arctica ) populations, but Norwegian populations have declined significantly during the last decades. In this paper we use biometric data from modern and archaeological F . arctica specimens to investigate patterns in body size variation over time of this iconic species. We aimed to set out a baseline for our archaeological comparison by firstly investigating whether modern subspecies of F . arctica are reflected in the osteological characters and are enough to distinguish subspecies from the bones alone. We then investigated if archaeological remains of F . arctica differ in size from the modern subspecies. Our results show that the subspecies Fratercula arctica naumanni was distinctly larger than the other subspecies. However, Fratercula arctica arctica and Fratercula arctica grabae were difficult to separate based on size. This generally supports ornithological observations. Post-Medieval F . arctica bones from Måsøy were similar to modern F . a . arctica populations. The mid-Holocene remains from Dollsteinhola overlaps with the modern size ranges of F . a . arctica and F . a . grabae but are generally shorter and more robust. Dollsteinhola is located close to the borders of the modern breeding ranges of both F . a . arctica and F . a . grabae . We consider it therefore likely that given the mid-Holocene climatic oscillations, breeding ranges of the two subspecies shifted north or south accordingly. However, this does not explain the different proportions of the Dollsteinhola specimens. Our data provide the first evidence for shifting distributions in ancient Atlantic Puffins and represent the first osteological analysis of Fratercula arctica subspecies."

This paper explores the modeling framework of driver behavior, including the perception module, decision-making module, and operation module. The perception module is proposed to stimulate the ability to perceive uncertainty and select attention in the dilemma zone. An SMPC-based driver control modeling method is proposed to stimulate decision-making behavior in the dilemma zone. The operation module is proposed to stimulate the execution ability of the driver. Finally, CarSim, the well-known vehicle dynamics analysis software package, is used to verify the proposed models of this paper. The simulation results show that the SMPC-based driver behavior model can effectively and accurately reflect the vehicle motion and dynamics under driving in the dilemma zone."

The OSA survey was composed of items organised into four sections: 1. Sociodemographic characteristics (11 items); 2. Geographical distribution (5 items); 3. Health status (3 items); 4. Previous and ongoing education specifications (16 items). A descriptive sample population analysis was performed. Dichotomous and categorical variables were presented as frequencies and percentages, and continuous variables were displayed as means and standard deviations. Some variables were analysed using a pentenary distribution. Results 49 out of the 61 OEIs identified matched the inclusion criteria, and among these, 22 accepted to propose the enrolment of their students into the study. The survey was administered to 4,720 students from all the participant OEIs. A total of 3,762 students responded to the survey, accounting for an estimated response rate of 53.7%. The majority of respondents were men (54%), with an average age of 26.9 ± 6.5 years. Almost the totality of the sample was composed of the European ethnic group (99.1%). Respondents were predominantly born in Italy (97.2%). The majority of the sample reported being in good (49.5%) to excellent (38.6%) health. To date, osteopathy students are almost evenly distributed between the two types of curricula (T1 = 46.6%; T2 = 53.4%). Conclusions The OSA is the first study that aims to profile Italian osteopathy students as a target population in terms of sociodemographic characteristics, geographical distribution, health status, and previous and ongoing education specifications. Future studies should focus on investigating the correlation between the sociodemographic characteristics of students and their academic performance."

To help mitigate the risk of epizootics, these ants display individual and collective immune responses, including associations with symbiotic bacteria that can enhance their resistance to pathogenic infections. For example, Acromyrmex spp. harbor actinobacteria that control infection by Escovopsis in their fungal gardens. Although Atta spp. do not maintain symbiosis with protective actinobacteria, the evidence suggests that these insects are colonized by bacterial microbiota that may play a role in their defense against pathogens. The potential role of the bacterial microbiome of Atta workers in enhancing host immunity remains unexplored. We evaluated multiple parameters of the individual immunity of Atta cephalotes (Linnaeus, 1758) workers, including hemocyte count, encapsulation response, and the antimicrobial activity of the hemolymph in the presence or absence of bacterial microbiota. Experiments were performed on ants reared under standard conditions as well as on ants previously exposed to the entomopathogenic fungus Metharrizium anisopliae . Furthermore, the effects of the presence/absence of bacteria on the survival of workers exposed to M . anisopliae were evaluated. The bacterial microbiota associated with A . cephalotes workers does not modulate the number of hemocytes under control conditions or under conditions of exposure to the fungal pathogen. In addition, infection by M . anisopliae , but not microbiota, increases the encapsulation response. Similarly, the exposure of workers to this fungus led to increased hemolymph antimicrobial activity. Conversely, the removal of bacterial microbiota did not have a significant impact on the survival of workers with M . anisopliae . Our results suggest that the bacterial microbiota associated with the cuticle of A . cephalotes workers does not play a role as a modulator of innate immunity, either at baseline or after exposure to the entomopathogen M . anisopliae . Further, upon infection, workers rely on mechanisms of humoral immunity to respond to this threat. Overall, our findings indicate that the bacterial microbiota associated with A . cephalotes workers does not play a defensive role."

Several factors have contributed to the increase of this threat, among which we highlight the lack of genetic information about the structure and taxonomic status of the species, as well as the lack of accurate tools for evaluation of the effectivity of current management programs. Based on Arapaima gigas’ whole genome, available at the NCBI database (ID: 12404), a total of 95,098 unique perfect microsatellites were identified, including their proposed primers. From this panel, a multiplex system containing 12 tetranucleotide microsatellite markers was validated. These tools are valuable for research in as many areas as bioinformatics, ecology, genetics, evolution and comparative studies, since they are able to provide more accurate information for fishing management, conservation of wild populations and genetic management of aquaculture."

https://openalex.org/W3188172608,"Bottom-up self-assembly of components, inspired by hierarchically self-regulating aggregation of small subunits observed in nature, provides a strategy for constructing two- or three-dimensional intriguing biomimetic materials via the spontaneous combination of discrete building blocks. Herein, we report the methods of ultrasonic wave energy-assisted, fast, two- and three-dimensional mesoscale well-ordered self-assembly of microfabricated building blocks (100 μm in size). Mechanical vibration energy-driven self-assembly of microplatelets at the water-air interface of inverted water droplets is demonstrated, and the real-time formation process of the patterned structure is dynamically explored. 40 kHz ultrasonic wave is transferred into microplatelets suspended in a water environment to drive the self-assembly of predesigned well-ordered structures. Two-dimensional self-assembly of microplatelets inside the water phase with a large patterned area is achieved. Stable three-dimensional multi-layered self-assembled structures are quickly formed at the air-water interface. These demonstrations aim to open distinctive and effective ways for new two-dimensional surface coating technology with autonomous organization strategy, and three-dimensional complex hierarchical architectures built by the bottom-up method and commonly found in nature (such as nacre, bone or enamel, etc.)."
