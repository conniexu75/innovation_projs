https://openalex.org/W1971700135,"The class B type I scavenger receptor, (SR-BI), is a member of the CD36 superfamily of proteins and is a physiologically relevant, high affinity cell surface high density lipoprotein (HDL) receptor that mediates selective lipid uptake. The mechanism of selective lipid uptake is fundamentally different from that of classic receptor-mediated uptake via coated pits and vesicles (<i>e.g.</i> the low density lipoprotein receptor pathway) in that it involves efficient transfer of the lipids, but not the outer shell proteins, from HDL to cells. The abilities of SR-BI and CD36, both of which are class B scavenger receptors, to bind HDL and mediate cellular uptake of HDL-associated lipid when transiently expressed in COS cells were examined. For these experiments, the binding of HDL to cells was assessed using either <sup>125</sup>I- or Alexa (a fluorescent dye)-HDL in which the apolipoproteins on the surface of the HDL particles were covalently modified. Lipid transfer was measured using HDL noncovalently labeled by the fluorescent lipid 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate. Although both mSR-BI and human CD36 (hCD36) could mediate the binding of HDL in a punctate pattern across the surfaces of cells, only mSR-BI efficiently mediated the transfer of lipid to the cells. Analysis of point mutants established that the major sites of fatty acylation of mSR-BI are Cys<sup>462</sup> and Cys<sup>470</sup> and that fatty acylation is not required for receptor clustering, HDL binding, or efficient lipid transfer. Generation of mSR-BI/hCD36 domain swap chimeras showed that the differences in lipid uptake activities between mSR-BI and hCD36 were not due to differences between their two sets of transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains but rather result from differences in their large extracellular loop domains. These results show that high affinity binding to a cell surface receptor is not sufficient to ensure efficient cellular lipid uptake from HDL. Thus, SR-BI-mediated binding combined with SR-BI-dependent facilitated transfer of lipid from the HDL particle to the cell appears to be the most likely mechanism for the bulk of the selective uptake of cholesteryl esters from HDL to the liver and steroidogenic tissues."

Two splice variants of GABAB receptors, GABABR1a and GABABR1b, were recently cloned from a mouse cortical and cerebellar cDNA library. As predicted, these receptors belong to the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. We have used epitope-tagged versions of GABABR1a receptors to study the cellular distribution of these proteins in a variety of non-neuronal and neuronal cell types. Here we report that recombinant GABAB receptors fail to reach the cell surface when expressed in heterologous systems and are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum when introduced into COS cells. In addition, we prove that recombinant GABAB receptors are excluded from the cell surface when overexpressed in ganglion neurons and we further demonstrate that they fail to activate in superior cervical ganglion neurons. Together our observations suggest that recombinant GABAB receptors require additional information for functional targeting to the plasma membrane. γ-Aminobutyric acid type B (GABAB) receptors mediate the transmission of slow and prolonged inhibitory signals in the central nervous system.

The fast inhibitory activity of GABA is mediated by the activation of ionotropic GABAA (and GABAC) receptors which are members of the ligand gated ion channel superfamily (1Rabow L.E. Russek S.J. Farb D.H. Synapse. 1995; 21: 189-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). The slower inhibitory actions of GABA are mediated by the activation of GABABreceptors which are G protein-coupled receptors (2Bowery N.G. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. 1993; 33: 109-147Crossref Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 3Mott D.D. Lewis D.V. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1994; 36: 97-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). GABAB receptors couple to various effector systems mainly through the activation of the specific G proteins Gαo, Gαq, Gαi, and Gβγ. Via these signal transduction molecules they inhibit adenylyl cyclase, inhibit histamine- and serotonin-induced accumulation of inositol triphosphate, inhibit voltage-gated calcium channels and activate potassium channels (3Mott D.D. Lewis D.V. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1994; 36: 97-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In general, activation of GABABreceptors results in modulation of neurotransmitter release from pre-synaptic neurons or hyperpolarization of post-synaptic membranes. These two mechanisms contribute significantly to long-term inhibition of synaptic transmission (3Mott D.D. Lewis D.V. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1994; 36: 97-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) and their inappropriate function may be implicated in a number of diseases of the central nervous system (3Mott D.D. Lewis D.V. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1994; 36: 97-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 4Wasterlain C.G. Shirasaka Y. Mazarati A.M. Spigelman I.

Two amino-terminal splice variants of GABAB receptors, GABABR1a and GABABR1b, were recently cloned from a mouse cortical and cerebellar cDNA library (6Kaupmann K. Huggel K. Heid J. Flor P.J. Bischoff S. Mickel S.J. McMaster G. Angst C. Bittiger H. Froestl W. Bettler B. Nature. 1997; 386: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). As expected, the proteins belong to the seven transmembrane, G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. In particular, the two clones showed significant homology to metabotropic glutamate receptors (7Pin J.P. Duvoisin R. Neuropharmacology. 1995; 34: 1-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (1234) Google Scholar, 6Kaupmann K. Huggel K. Heid J. Flor P.J. Bischoff S. Mickel S.J. McMaster G. Angst C. Bittiger H. Froestl W. Bettler B. Nature. 1997; 386: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar), a Ca2+sensing receptor (8Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Herbert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2366) Google Scholar), and vomeronasal receptors (9Herrada G. Dulac C.

Cell. 1997; 90: 775-784Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Receptors belonging to this family contain an intracellular carboxyl-terminal tail, characteristic seven-membrane spanning domains, and a large amino-terminal extracellular domain, which in metabotropic glutamate receptors and GABAB receptors includes a region structurally related to bacterial amino acid-binding proteins (6Kaupmann K. Huggel K. Heid J. Flor P.J. Bischoff S. Mickel S.J. McMaster G. Angst C. Bittiger H. Froestl W. Bettler B. Nature. 1997; 386: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 11O'Hara P.J.

Binding properties to antagonists revealed strong similarities between expressed recombinant GABABR1a and endogenous rat cortex GABAB receptors. However, recombinant receptors had a 100-fold reduced affinity for full agonists as compared with native receptors (6Kaupmann K. Huggel K. Heid J. Flor P.J. Bischoff S. Mickel S.J. McMaster G. Angst C. Bittiger H. Froestl W. Bettler B. Nature. 1997; 386: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). The significance of this discrepancy is still unclear. In terms of coupling to effector systems, GABABR1a mediated the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase in transfected HEK 293 cells. Nevertheless, the receptors failed to couple to K+ channels in Xenopus oocytes (6Kaupmann K. Huggel K. Heid J. Flor P.J. Bischoff S. Mickel S.J. McMaster G. Angst C. Bittiger H. Froestl W. Bettler B. Nature. 1997; 386: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). In order to investigate the possible causes of the inability of recombinant receptors to couple properly to effector systems, we have used epitope-tagged versions of recombinant GABAB receptors to examine for the first time their subcellular distribution in heterologous systems and neuronal cell types. We have found that recombinant GABAB receptors fail to reach the cell surface in several cellular contexts and remain inactive in superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons. Our results suggest that intracellular retention constitutes a plausible reason for the inactivity of recombinant receptors in the systems studied so far. pBlueScript based plasmids containing the sequence for GABABR1a receptors were tagged with the 10-amino acid 9E10 epitope (EQKLISEEDL) from c-Myc (12Evan G.I. Lewis G. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar) by site-directed mutagenesis (13Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4900) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide GABAB-9E10–1 (GGTGGCGTTGGGGGTTAGGTCTTCTTCTGATATTAGCTTTTGTTCCTGCGCCCCGCCAGC) was used to tag the receptor between the fourth and fifth amino acid of the mature protein and GABAB9E10-3 (CTCCATGCCCCCTCATAGGTCTTCTTCTGATATTAGCTTTTGTTCCTTGTAAAGCAAATG) was used to tag the receptor at the carboxyl terminus. All mutations and the fidelity of the final expression constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. SpeI-NdeI fragments of these constructs or of untagged sequences were subcloned into a CMV based expression vector to constitute the plasmids AC5-Gbm (amino-terminal 9E10, N-GABAB), AC10-Gbm (carboxyl-terminal 9E10, C-GABAB), and AC25-Gb (untagged receptor, GABAB). GABAA receptor subunit expression constructs have been previously described (14Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). A reporter plasmid encoding for the S65T mutant of the jellyfish Aequorea victoria green fluorescent protein (GFP) was used as described previously (15Heim R. Cubitt A.B. Tsien R.Y. Nature. 1995; 373: 663-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (1522) Google Scholar). COS, human embryonic kidney (293 HEK), and baby hamster kidney cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Exponentially growing cells were transfected with 10 μg of DNA by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene-Pulser H according to instructions from the manufacturer. Cells were incubated 12–18 h to allow expression of recombinant proteins. 9E10 antibody was obtained from 9E10 hybridoma cells and used as supernatant for immunofluorescence or as affinity purified antibody for immunoprecipitations and 125I-surface binding experiments. Polyclonal anti-Myc antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-FLAG mouse monoclonal antibody was purchased from IBI Ltd. The secondary antibodies, anti-mouse Texas Red (TR), anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate, and anti-rabbit fluorescein isothiocyanate were purchased from Pierce. COS cells were cultured as described, transfected by electroporation, and plated onto 6-cm dishes. Cells were washed twice with methionine-free DMEM and l-methionine starved for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were washed twice and incubated in 1 ml of methionine-free DMEM containing 0.5 mCi [35S]methionine (Easytag, NEN Life Science Products Inc.) for 4 h at 37 °C. For pulse-chase experiments cells were labeled for 2 h and further incubated in complete DMEM supplemented with 3 mg/ml l-methionine for the indicated period of time. For glycosylation analysis, cells were exposed to tunicamycin (5 μg/ml) during the 4-h [35S]methionine labeling period. After incubation periods, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and removed in 0.6 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 5 mmEGTA, 5 mm EDTA, 16.9 mmNa2HPO4, 3.1 mmNaH2PO4, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml antipain). Nuclei were removed from cell lysates by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm × 5 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge. Cell lysates were preabsorbed with previously equilibrated 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose beads were then removed by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm × 30 s at 4 °C, and lysates were incubated with 5 μg of 9E10 monoclonal antibody for 1 h at 4 °C. Immune complexes were precipitated with 25 μl of protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Sepharose beads were washed twice in lysis buffer, twice in high salt lysis buffer (lysis buffer containing 0.5m NaCl), and again in lysis buffer. Bead pellets were resuspended in 40 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) loading buffer, boiled for 3 min, and analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Transfected COS cells were metabolically labeled for 4 h and immunoprecipitated with 9E10 antibodies as described above. Bead pellets were washed three times in lysis buffer and three times in high salt lysis buffer. Sepharose beads were then resuspended in 50 μl of endoglycosidase H reaction buffer (40 mm phosphate buffer, 50 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.01% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, pH 5.5) and boiled for 3 min. 1 milliunit of endoglycosidase H (Boehringer Mannheim) and protease inhibitors (0.1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 μg/ml antipain) were added and digestions were carried at 37 °C for 14 h. After the incubation period 25 μl of SDS-PAGE loading buffer were added, reactions were boiled for 4 min, and analyzed by 8% SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Transfected cells were plated onto 6-cm dishes containing 5 μg/ml fibronectin and 10 μg/ml poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips. Cells were washed twice with PBS, fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed twice with 0.5 m NH4Cl, and blocked for 30 min in immunofluorescence solution (0.25% bovine serum albumin, 10% fetal bovine serum in PBS). For detection of surface proteins in intact cells, cells were incubated with 9E10 supernatant diluted 1:1 in immunofluorescence solution for 45 min at room temperature and with 1 μg/ml TR or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibodies for 45 min. For treatment of permeabilized cells, the procedure described above was followed by incubating the cells in immunofluorescence solution containing 0.5% Nonidet P-40 for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with 0.5 mNH4Cl and blocked as described above. Incubation with 9E10 was performed with 1:1 diluted antibody in immunofluorescence solution containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40. Different secondary antibodies were used for detection of intracellular epitopes in order to compare surface and intracellular protein localization. All samples were washed with PBS before mounting and were examined using a confocal microscope (MRC1000, Bio-Rad). Transfected COS and HEK 293 cells were plated onto uncoated or 5 μg/ml fibronectin and 10 μg/ml poly-l-lysine coated 6 × 4-cm well plates, respectively. Prior to incubation with 9E10 antibody, cells were chilled on an ice bed, washed three times with ice-cold PBS, and twice with iodination medium (0.25% BSA NaHCO3-free DMEM, pH 7.4). Cells were then incubated in iodination medium containing 9E10 iodinated to a specific activity of 500 Ci/mmol (Amersham International) and used at 10–15 μg/ml for 90 min on an ice bed. After incubation, medium was removed and cells were washed five times with ice-cold PBS. Cells were removed with 1 ml of trypsin, transferred to Röhren tubes, and counted in a γ-counter (Wallac, 1261 Multigamma). For electrophysiology, single SCG neurons were dissociated from 15–19-day-old rats and plated on poly-d-lysine-coated glass coverslips bordered by 2-cm plastic rings as described previously (16Marrion N.V. Smart T.G. Brown D.A. Neurosci. Lett. 1987; 77: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). 4 h after plating, neurons were microinjected with an equal mixture of plasmids carrying cDNA for the N-GABAB or GABAB receptor (final pipette concentration of 0.5 μg/μl dissolved in water) and cDNA for S65T mutant of GFP or with GFP cDNA alone. DNA (1.2 μl) was loaded into pre-pulled high resistance (∼30 megaohm) “Pyrex” glass pipettes and injected into the nucleus of single neurons as described previously for injection of antisera or cRNA (17Caulfield M.P. Jones S. Vallis Y. Buckley N.J. Kim G.-D. Milligan G. Brown D.A. J. Physiol. 1994; 477: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar,18Filippov A.K. Webb T.E. Barnard E.A. A. B.D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 849-851Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). After injections, cells were incubated for 14–24 h in a humidified incubator (5% CO2) at 37 °C. Injected neurons which successfully expressed cDNA were identified as bright fluorescent cells using an inverted microscope (Diaphot 200, Nikon, Japan) equipped with an epifluorescent block N B2E (Nikon). Electrophysiological recordings were made at room temperature 14–24 h after injection. SCG and DRG primary neurons for immunofluorescence, kindly provided by Mariza Dayrell and Kenji Okuse, respectively, were obtained and cultured as described previously (19Marrion N.V. Smart T.G. Marsh S.J. Brown D.A. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1989; 98: 557-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 20Lindsay R.M. J. Neurosci. 1988; 8: 2394-2405Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Microinjection of neurons was performed as described previously (21Smart T.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1987; 389: 337-360Crossref Scopus (59) Google Scholar) using an Eppendorf Transjector (5246), an Eppendorf Micromanipulator (5171), and a Nikon Diaphot 300 microscope. Currents through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels were recorded using the conventional whole cell patch-clamp method as described previously (17Caulfield M.P. Jones S. Vallis Y. Buckley N.J. Kim G.-D. Milligan G. Brown D.A. J. Physiol. 1994; 477: 415-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Cells were superfused (20–25 ml/min) with a solution consisting of 120 mm tetraethylammonium chloride, 3 mmKCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 5 mmBaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 11.1 mmglucose, and 0.5 mm tetrodotoxin. The pH was adjusted to 7.35 with NaOH. Patch electrodes (2–3 megaohm) were filled with a solution containing 110 mm CsCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 40 mm HEPES, 3 mm EGTA, 2 mm Na2ATP, 0.5 mmNa2GTP (pH adjusted to 7.4 with CsOH). Neurons were voltage-clamped using a discontinuous (“switching”) amplifier (Axoclamp 2B) sampling voltage at 6–8 kHz (50% duty cycle). Commands were generated through a Digidata 1200 interface using “pClamp 6” computer software (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Ca2+channel currents were routinely evoked every 20 s with 100-ms depolarizing rectangular test pulse to 0 mV from a holding potential of −90 mV. Currents were digitized and stored on a computer for later analysis using pClamp 6 software. Ca2+ channel current amplitudes were measured isochronally 10 ms from the onset of the rectangular test pulse, i.e. near to the peak of the control current. To eliminate leak currents, Ca2+ was substituted for Ba2+ in the external solution at the end of each experiment to block all Ca2+ channel currents and the residual current was digitally subtracted from the corresponding currents in Ba2+ solution. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. The statistical significance of the results was determined by Student's t test (unpaired). To initiate our studies of subcellular distribution, targeting and cellular trafficking of recombinant GABAB receptors, we introduced the Myc epitope tag at the amino- (N-GABAB) and carboxyl-terminal (C-GABAB) domains of the murine GABABR1a protein. These constructs were used to analyze the expression of GABAB receptors in heterologous systems. To achieve this, COS cells were transfected with N-GABAB and metabolically labeled with [35S]methionine. GABAB receptors were immunoprecipitated using 9E10 monoclonal antibodies directed against the Myc epitope. A predominant protein of approximately 120–130 kDa was specifically immunoprecipitated from lysates derived from N-GABABtransfected cells and was absent from mock transfected controls (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 3). The size of the immunoprecipitated protein is in agreement with the molecular mass of recombinant GABABR1a (6Kaupmann K. Huggel K. Heid J. Flor P.J. Bischoff S. Mickel S.J. McMaster G. Angst C. Bittiger H. Froestl W. Bettler B. Nature. 1997; 386: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Notably, a fraction of the immunoprecipitated product migrated above 200 kDa in N-GABAB-transfected cells and was also absent from mock transfected controls (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1 and 3). The presence of these bands suggest the existence of GABABreceptor aggregates resistant to reducing conditions. The existence of metabotropic glutamate receptors dimers sets a precedent for such observation (22Romano C. Yang W.L. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28612-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Analysis of the GABABR1a DNA sequence indicates that the gene product contains at least seven putativeN-glycosylation sites. To determine whether N-GABAB was glycosylated in this particular expression system, cells were exposed to tunicamycin during the 35S labeling period and immunoprecipitated as described above. N-GABAB was sensitive to tunicamycin as indicated by a significant decrease in the molecular mass of the 120–130 kDa immunoprecipitated protein (Fig. 1 A, lanes 3 and 4) indicating that recombinant GABAB receptors are glycoproteins. In order to confirm that the immunoprecipitated protein corresponded to the full-length GABAB receptor, cells were transfected with C-GABAB. Since this receptor contains the epitope tag at the carboxyl terminus, only translation of the complete gene would ensure detection of a protein of a mass of 120–130 kDa. Mock and C-GABAB-transfected cells were metabolically labeled and the receptor was immunoprecipitated as described above. A prevailing protein was immunoprecipitated from C-GABAB lysates and was absent from lysates of mock transfected cells (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1 and 2). Importantly, the migration of C-GABAB and N-GABAB were indistinguishable by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1, A, lane 3, and B, lane 2). Together these results demonstrate that full-length recombinant GABAB receptors are expressed in COS cells and that they are modified by glycosylation, presumably as they enter and mature through the secretory pathway. The predicted membrane topology of GABAB receptors and other G protein-coupled receptors suggests that the amino-terminal domain of the protein is exposed to the extracellular environment (6Kaupmann K. Huggel K. Heid J. Flor P.J. Bischoff S. Mickel S.J. McMaster G. Angst C. Bittiger H. Froestl W. Bettler B. Nature. 1997; 386: 239-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar, 23Strader C.D. Fong T.M. Tota M.R. Underwood D. Dixon R.A.F. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (996) Google Scholar). This implies that the 9E10 epitope in cell surface N-GABAB receptors will be accessible to antibodies in intact cells. Taking advantage of this position-specific marker, we sought to determine the cellular distribution of GABAB receptors in COS cells using immunofluorescence. As a control for the assay, cells were transfected with an amino-terminal 9E10-tagged version of the β3 subunit of the GABAA receptor (β3–9E10). The β3 subunit is targeted to the cell surface and forms functional Cl− channels when expressed homomerically in a variety of cell types (24Davies P.A. Kirkness E.F. Hales T.G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 120: 899-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 25Wooltorton J.R.A. Moss S.J. Smart T.G. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 2225-2235Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). In addition, its amino-terminal domain is exposed extracellularly following targeting to the plasma membrane. In agreement with these observations, β3–9E10 was expressed in COS cells and detected at the cell surface of intact cells (Fig. 2 A, upper left panel). Upon detergent permeabilization, significant amounts of the protein were detected in intracellular compartments confirming previous reports (26Connolly C.N. Wooltorton J.R.A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9899-9904Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 A, lower left panel). Surprisingly, when recombinant GABAB receptors were expressed in the same system, no surface staining was detected in intact cells (Fig. 2 A, upper right panel). However, upon permeabilization, large amounts of the protein were detected intracellularly (Fig. 2 A, lower right panel). To confirm these results, N-GABAB was expressed in HEK 293 and baby hamster kidney cells. The receptors failed to reach the plasma membrane in either cell type (Fig. 2,B and C, upper panels) despite high intracellular accumulation of the protein (Fig. 2, B and C, lower panel). These results suggest that recombinant receptors are excluded from the plasma membrane when expressed in heterologous systems. To further examine these results, the presence of surface proteins was evaluated by measuring the amount of surface-bound125I-conjugated 9E10 antibodies in intact COS and HEK 293 cells. As a control, the α1 and β2 subunits of GABAAreceptors were used. The subcellular localization of these proteins has been extensively studied in our laboratory. Briefly α1 and β2 fail to reach the cell surface when expressed independently, but coexpression overcomes this deficiency and the α1β2 dimer is found predominantly at the cell surface (14Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). To follow the distribution of α1 and β2, an amino-terminal 9E10-tagged α1 subunit was utilized (α1–9E10). Importantly, the presence of an amino-terminal epitope tag does not modify the function of the α1 subunit and allows detection of the protein at the cell surface of intact cells (14Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). As expected, surface levels of α1–9E10 were very low and were significantly increased by coexpression of β2 (Fig. 3 A). In agreement with our immunofluorescence results, surface levels of N-GABAB were similar to those of α1–9E10 (Fig. 3 A). More importantly, N-GABAB and C-GABAB levels did not differ significantly. Since the carboxyl-terminal epitope in C-GABAB is predicted to reside in the cytoplasm, these results clearly indicate that both tagged receptors are equally inaccessible to 9E10 antibodies in intact cells. The same experiment was performed in HEK 293 cells and similar results were obtained (Fig. 3 B). These observations further suggest that recombinant GABAB receptors fail to reach the plasma membrane in heterologous systems. The possibility that the 9E10 epitope might interfere with receptor localization or function seems unlikely because the 9E10-tagged full-length receptor is expressed abundantly, modified by glycosylation, and presents antagonist binding properties which are very similar to the ones observed for untagged receptors, suggesting that N-GABAB receptors maintain the appropriate conformation (not shown). Rapid recycling of receptors between an intracellular compartment and the plasma membrane, with short permanence at the cell surface, would result in intracellular accumulation of most of the protein. To address this possibility, putative cell surface receptors were labeled with antibodies on live N-GABAB-transfected COS cells. Cells were exposed to 9E10 monoclonal antibodies and incubated at 37 °C to allow endocytosis of the potential antibody-receptor complexes. Subsequently, immunofluorescence was performed to detect these complexes in vesicular structures underlying the plasma membrane. Although this technique has been applied successfully in detecting the fast recycling of the GABAA γ2 subunit, 2C. Connolly, unpublished results. no signal was obtained upon examination of N-GABAB transfected cells that had been fed with 9E10 antibodies (not shown). The inability of recombinant GABAB receptors to reach the cell surface under our experimental conditions may result from a very slow transport machinery. To address this issue the half-life of N-GABAB was determined in COS cells by a pulse-chase experiment. Briefly, cells were transfected with N-GABABand labeled with a pulse of [35S]methionine. After 2 h, cells were incubated in regular media and lysates were prepared at different time points after the [35S]methionine pulse. N-GABAB was immunorecipitated from cell lysates and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Confirming the results described above, N-GABAB was specifically immunoprecipitated from lysates of transfected cells and was absent from lysates of mock transfected controls (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 2). The protein was stable for approximately 4 h and declined thereafter (Fig. 4, lanes 2–5). The amounts of [35S]methionine-labeled protein at each time point were used to estimate the half-life of the receptor which was approximately 10 h. The time required for the receptor to reach the cell surface cannot exceed the life span of the protein. Thus, absence of surface receptors does not seem to result from slow transport, since detection of receptors was always performed 12–18 h after transfection. The outcomes of these last two experiments indicate that recombinant GABAB receptors do not reach the plasma membrane at detectable levels, and strongly suggest that they are retained in some intermediate compartment of the secretory pathway. Our results concerning sensitivity to tunicamycin indicated that recombinant receptors entered the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). To determine whether they were specifically retained in the ER or whether they trafficked to successive compartments, N-GABABand an ER resident protein were detected simultaneously in COS cells. Previous studies in our laboratory have conclusively demonstrated that the GABAA β2 subunit is retained in the ER when expressed alone (14Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J.

In studying the effect of apolipoprotein (apo) E on the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, we found that expressing high plasma levels of human apoE3 in transgenic mice lacking endogenous mouse apoE caused HTG. These transgenic animals had 3-fold higher plasma triglyceride levels, higher very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), and lower high density lipoproteins than did nontransgenics. Removing one or both low density lipoprotein receptor alleles in the apoE3-overexpressing mice caused severe HTG (8–11-fold over nontransgenics) and increased VLDL and decreased low and high density lipoproteins, and apoE3-enriched VLDL were markedly depleted in apoC-II. At least two mechanisms could explain HTG associated with apoE3 overexpression: stimulated VLDL triglyceride production and impaired VLDL lipolysis. The apoE3 mice with HTG had a 50% increase in hepatic VLDL triglyceride production. Furthermore, overexpression of apoE (E2, E3, or E4) in cultured hepatocytes (McA-RH7777 cells) correlated positively with secretion of VLDL into the medium. However, apoE3 overexpression–associated HTG was only partially explained by VLDL overproduction, as lipoprotein lipase–mediated VLDL lipolysis was also decreased 20–86% depending on apoE3 levels, most likely by displacing or masking apoC-II on the particles. In human subjects, HTG correlated positively with increased VLDL triglyceride and plasma and VLDL apoE levels. However, plasma and VLDL apoE correlated negatively with VLDL apoC-II levels and lipoprotein lipase-mediated VLDL lipolysis. Thus, optimal expression of apoE is crucial for normal metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and overexpression and/or accumulation of apoE may contribute to HTG by stimulating VLDL triglyceride production and by impairing VLDL lipolysis.

In humans and rodents, plasma triglycerides are transported mostly by intestine-derived chylomicrons and liver-derived VLDL. One of the major protein constituents of these triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (9Mahley R.W. Science. 1988; 240: 622-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (3395) Google Scholar), apolipoprotein (apo) E, serves as a high affinity ligand for several hepatic lipoprotein receptors, including the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and the LDL receptor–related protein, and for cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (10Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 1953-1980Google Scholar, 11Mahley R.W. Ji Z.-S.

By interacting with these receptors or with heparan sulfate proteoglycans, apoE mediates the clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants from the circulation (10Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 1953-1980Google Scholar, 12Mahley R.W. Isr. J. Med. Sci. 1996; 32: 414-429PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, structural mutations of apoE cause significant alterations in triglyceride-rich lipoprotein metabolism, such as type III hyperlipoproteinemia, which is characterized by both hypercholesterolemia and HTG (10Mahley R.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 7th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 1953-1980Google Scholar). Recently, clinical studies have shown that plasma levels of apoE are also important determinants of the metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (13Salah D. Bohnet K. Gueguen R. Siest G. Visvikis S. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 904-912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In fact, 20–40% of the variability of triglyceride levels in humans can be explained by plasma apoE concentrations (13Salah D. Bohnet K. Gueguen R. Siest G. Visvikis S. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 904-912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which are independent of apoE polymorphism (14Cohn J.S. Tremblay M. Amiot M. Bouthillier D. Roy M. Genest Jr., J.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of apoE3 expression levels on plasma triglyceride-rich lipoprotein metabolism in both transgenic mice and humans. Our data indicate that overexpression and accumulation of apoE may contribute to HTG by stimulating hepatic VLDL triglyceride production and by impairing VLDL lipolysis. A Superose 6 column purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech was used on a Pharmacia fast protein liquid chromatography system. Cholesterol and triglyceride standards were from Abbott (North Chicago, IL) and Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany), respectively. The automated system for lipid analysis (Kinetic Microplate Reader) was from Molecular Devices (Menlo Park, CA). Triton WR1339, oleic acid, free fatty acid–free bovine serum albumin, and bovine milk lipoprotein lipase (LPL) were from Sigma. [14C]Acetate, and ECL chemiluminescence detection kits for Western blots were purchased from Amersham Life Science (Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Hemizygous human apoE3 transgenic mice (ICR strain) were produced at the Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease with a DNA construct containing human apoE3 genomic DNA and the hepatic control region (15Simonet W.S. Bucay N. Lauer S.J. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8221-8229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Homozygous apoE knockout (mE0) and homozygous LDL receptor knockout (LDLR0) mice (C57BL/6 strain) were purchased from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). ApoE and LDL receptor double-knockout mice (mE0/LDLR0) were generated in our laboratory by crossbreeding apoE knockout mice with LDL receptor knockout mice. Male transgenic mice expressing low (apoE3 = 8 mg/dl; E3low) or high (apoE3 = 22 mg/dl; E3high) levels of human apoE3 were crossbred with female apoE knockout mice (mE0) to generate apoE3 transgenic mice without endogenous mouse apoE (E3low/mE0 and E3high/mE0). The human apoE3 transgene was detected by immunoblotting plasma (1 μl) with human-specific anti-apoE polyclonal antiserum (16Huang Y. Schwendner S.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29146-29151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Mouse apoE deficiency was established by Western blotting with mouse-specific anti-apoE antiserum (provided by Dr. Jan Borén, Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease). In some cases, E3low/mE0 or E3high/mE0 mice were crossbred with LDL receptor–null mice lacking mouse apoE (mE0/LDLR0) to generate E3low/mE0 or E3high/mE0 mice on a heterozygous (E3low/mE0/LDLR1 or E3high/mE0/LDLR1) or a homozygous (E3low/mE0/LDLR0 or E3high/mE0/LDLR0) LDL receptor–null background. LDL receptor deficiency was assessed by polymerase chain reaction with specific primers designed to identify both the altered and the unaltered gene sequences (17Huang Y. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 2817-2824Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Human subjects were selected from the PROCAM Study group (6Assmann G. Schulte H. von Eckardstein A. Am. J. Cardiol. 1996; 77: 1179-1184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar) at the Arteriosclerosis Research Institute, University of Münster, Münster, Germany. Type IV hyperlipidemic subjects (n = 27) were defined as having plasma triglycerides >200 mg/dl and LDL cholesterol <140 mg/dl (18Fredrickson D.S. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. Stanbury J.B. Wyngaarden J.B. Fredrickson D.S. The Metabolic Basis of Inherited Disease. 4th Ed. McGraw-Hill, New York1978: 604-655Google Scholar). Normolipidemic subjects (n = 6) were defined as having plasma triglycerides <200 mg/dl and LDL cholesterol <140 mg/dl. Mouse blood was collected from the tails of 8–16-week-old mice that had been fasted for 5 h. Human blood was collected from normolipidemic and type IV hyperlipidemic subjects after an overnight fast; EDTA was used as an anticoagulant. Plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm (microcentrifuge) for 10 min (mouse samples) or at 3000 rpm for 15 min (human samples) at 4 °C. Cholesterol and triglyceride levels were measured on total plasma and on chromatographic fractions by an enzymatic colorimetric method adapted for use with a microplate reader (19Fazio S. Lee Y.-L.

Chem. 1992; 267: 1962-1968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Lipoproteins of mouse or human plasma (100 μl) were separated by chromatography on a Superose 6 column as described previously (16Huang Y. Schwendner S.W. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29146-29151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 21Fazio S. Yao Z. McCarthy B.J. Rall Jr., S.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6941-6945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The major lipoprotein classes eluted from the column were pooled and concentrated with Centricon filters (fractions 16–18, VLDL; fractions 19–22, intermediate density lipoproteins; fractions 23–27, LDL and HDL1; and fractions 28–33, HDL). To analyze the distribution of apoE in various lipoproteins, the pooled samples representing different lipoprotein classes were separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel-SDS followed by immunoblotting with anti-human apoE antiserum. For analysis of chemical compositions and lipolysis of VLDL, the VLDL (d < 1.006 g/ml) were isolated from both mouse and human plasma by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 rpm for 2 h at 4 °C in a Beckman TL100 ultracentrifuge (22de Silva H.V. Más-Oliva J. Taylor J.M. Mahley R.W. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 1297-1310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cholesterol and triglyceride levels were measured as described above. Apolipoproteins were separated on 10–20% polyacrylamide-SDS gradient gels. The amounts of human or mouse apoE and human or mouse apoC-II were determined by Western blotting with polyclonal antibodies against human apoE, mouse apoE, human apoC-II, and mouse apoC-II, respectively (kindly provided by Dr. Karl Weisgraber, Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease) (17Huang Y.

Purified human apoE, mouse apoE, human apoC-II, and mouse apoC-II were used as standards, respectively (provided by Dr. Karl Weisgraber). Hepatic VLDL triglyceride production was determined with the Triton WR1339 method (25Aalto-Setälä K. Fisher E.A. Chen X. Chajek-Shaul T. Hayek T. Zechner R. Walsh A. Ramakrishnan R. Ginsberg H.N.

Briefly, nontransgenic or various apoE3 transgenic mice were injected intravenously with 500 mg of Triton WR1339 (300 mg/ml in 0.9% NaCl) per kg of body weight after an overnight fast. Blood samples (50 μl) were collected 0, 15, 30, 60, and 90 min later. Plasma triglyceride concentrations were measured as described above. The hepatic VLDL triglyceride production rate was calculated from the slope of the curve and presented as μmol/h/kg. To determine the effects of apoE expression levels on VLDL triglyceride production in vitro, rat hepatoma cells (McA-RH7777) were cotransfected with various apoE isoform genomic DNA and a neomycin gene (27Ji Z.-S. Fazio S. Lee Y.-L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2764-2772Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Stably transfected colonies were selected by culturing the cells in medium containing G418 (400 μg/ml) for 2 weeks. Positive colonies were characterized by a reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction with primers specific for the human apoE gene and by anti-human apoE immunoblotting. Over 140 colonies were screened, and three transfected cell lines for each apoE isoform, which had matched apoE secretion levels, were selected for study. VLDL triglyceride production rates were determined by incubating nontransfected and transfected cells with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% bovine serum albumin, 1 mm oleic acid, and [14C]acetate (5 μCi/ml) at 37 °C for 4 h (26Kuipers F.

After incubation, the media were collected, and VLDL were isolated by ultracentrifugation at d < 1.006 g/ml. Lipids were extracted from VLDL with chloroform/methanol (2:1), separated by thin-layer chromatography, and quantitated by measuring the radioactivity of each fraction. To determine the ability of normal and apoE-enriched VLDL to serve as substrates for lipase-mediated lipolysis, various VLDL samples (30 μg of triglycerides) were incubated with 1 μg of bovine milk LPL or 50 μl of hepatic lipase–transfected cell-conditioned medium for 30 min at 37 °C. In some cases, specific amounts of purified human apoE3 or apoC-II were included in the incubation (23Huang Y. Liu X.Q. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17483-17490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). After incubation, the levels of released free fatty acids were determined by an enzymatic colorimetric method (29Connelly P.W. Maguire G.F. Vezina C. Hegele R.A. Kuksis A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20554-20560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Wako Chemicals, Richmond, VA). In studying the effects of apoE on triglyceride-rich lipoprotein metabolism, we found that hepatic overexpression of human apoE3 at high levels (∼30 mg/dl) in transgenic mice lacking endogenous mouse apoE (E3high/mE0) led to mild HTG (an ∼3-fold increase in plasma triglycerides versus nontransgenic mice) without significant changes in plasma total cholesterol (Table I). In contrast, low levels of apoE3 expression (∼13 mg/dl) on the same genetic background (E3low/mE0) did not alter plasma triglyceride levels significantly (Table I, Fig. 1 B). The E3high/mE0 mice had increased VLDL triglyceride and cholesterol and decreased HDL cholesterol (Fig. 1, C versus A), with accumulation of apoE3 in the VLDL fraction (Table I). Thus, overexpression of apoE3 in transgenic mice alters the plasma lipoprotein profile to one that resembles the human HTG phenotype.Table ILipid and apoE levels in plasma and VLDL from different lines of miceMicePlasmaVLDLVLDL-TG production ratenHuman apoE3Mouse apoETCTGnHuman apoE3Mouse apoEApoC-IImg/dlμg/mg TGμmol/h/kgNontransgenic1807 ± 279 ± 1047 ± 206019 ± 432 ± 6148 ± 18E3low/mE01213 ± 2060 ± 654 ± 10623 ± 5026 ± 5168 ± 19E3high/mE01530 ± 4078 ± 19128 ± 36638 ± 5013 ± 2221 ± 11LDLR119010 ± 3134 ± 1455 ± 186024 ± 625 ± 5E3low/mE0/LDLR11317 ± 20136 ± 1062 ± 17E3high/mE0/LDLR11745 ± 40148 ± 14361 ± 69646 ± 407 ± 1LDLR015015 ± 3255 ± 3486 ± 196030 ± 720 ± 3E3low/mE0/LDLR0923 ± 30261 ± 1189 ± 18E3/high/mE0/LDLR01654 ± 40294 ± 37532 ± 59655 ± 703 ± 1199 ± 16Mice were in a mixed genetic background (C57BL6/ICR) and analyzed at 2–4 months of age.

To determine if further accumulation of apoE3 in mouse plasma would exacerbate the HTG, we crossed the E3high/mE0 mice with LDL receptor knockout mice (LDLR0) to eliminate one of the pathways for apoE clearance. Removing one (E3high/mE0/LDLR1) and then both (E3high/mE0/LDLR0) LDL receptor alleles increased plasma apoE3 by 50% and 80% (Table I) and plasma triglyceride levels by ∼3- and ∼4-fold, respectively, compared with the E3high/mE0 mice. VLDL cholesterol and triglycerides also increased significantly (compare Fig. 1, C with E and F). Thus, additional accumulation of apoE3 caused by the LDL receptor deficiency further exacerbates the apoE3 overexpression–induced HTG phenotype. Interestingly, removal of LDL receptors from the E3low/mE0 mice did not significantly alter plasma triglyceride levels, possibly because the apoE3 levels were not elevated sufficiently to affect triglyceride levels (Table I). Thus, rather than an absence of LDL receptors, an increased apoE3 level seems to be an important determinant of plasma triglyceride metabolism. In fact, plasma triglycerides correlated positively with apoE levels in apoE3 transgenic mice (Fig. 2 A). Triglyceride levels increased ∼11-fold as plasma apoE3 rose from ∼10 to ∼55 mg/dl (Fig. 2 A). At least two mechanisms could explain the HTG associated with apoE3 overexpression: stimulated VLDL triglyceride production and impaired VLDL lipolysis. To ascertain if apoE3-overexpressing mice had increased VLDL triglyceride production, a characteristic of human HTG (2Chait A. Albers J.J. Brunzell J.D. Eur. J. Clin.

Suppl. 1974; 4: 29-34Google Scholar), we determined in vivo VLDL triglyceride production rates in various apoE3 transgenic mouse lines using intravenous administration of Triton WR1339 to inhibit lipolysis (25Aalto-Setälä K. Fisher E.A. Chen X. Chajek-Shaul T. Hayek T. Zechner R. Walsh A. Ramakrishnan R. Ginsberg H.N. Breslow J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1889-1900Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). The E3high/mE0 mice had a 50% increase in VLDL triglyceride production rate compared with nontransgenic mice, whereas the E3low/mE0 mice had no significant change (Table I). The VLDL triglyceride production rate correlated positively with plasma apoE levels (Fig. 2 B), suggesting that apoE3 overexpression–induced HTG is at least partially due to stimulation of VLDL triglyceride production. The effect of apoE on VLDL synthesis and/or secretion was further established by expressing different levels of apoE2, E3, or E4 in rat hepatoma cells (McA-RH7777). Three transfected cell lines were selected for each apoE isoform according to their expression levels of apoE, which varied over 7-fold from lowest to highest (Table II). Interestingly, expression levels of endogenous rat apoE were not changed by overexpressing human apoE. Increasing levels of apoE expression actually resulted in decreased VLDL triglyceride secretion into the medium. However, an increase in apoE likely stimulates the reuptake of secreted VLDL via the heparan sulfate proteoglycan/LDL receptor–related protein pathway (12Mahley R.W. Isr. J. Med. Sci. 1996; 32: 414-429PubMed Google Scholar, 28Ji Z.-S. Brecht W.J. Miranda R.D. Hussain M.M. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol.

Thus, an increase in apoE expression by the hepatoma cells correlates with increased VLDL synthesis and/or secretion. Similar results were obtained with all three apoE isoforms, confirming that the effect is independent of isoform type.Table IIEffect of apoE expression levels on VLDL triglyceride production in McA-RH7777 cells stably transfected with various apoE isoformsCell linesApoE in mediumVLDL triglyceride secretionHuman apoEMouse apoEWithout heparinaseWith heparinaseng/mg cell protein/hdpm/mg cell protein/4 hMcA-RH7777035352735604McA-Neo036854515719McA-apoE2–130932151936682McA-apoE2–2121033232778828McA-apoE2–32200364210311576McA-apoE3–133832719586223McA-apoE3–2123733916407815McA-apoE3–324363458189896McA-apoE4–131836828786540McA-apoE4–2115334724918224McA-apoE4–3219235583210924Values are means of duplicate experiments.

However, the VLDL triglyceride production rate in the E3high/mE0/LDLR0 mice did not differ significantly from that of the E3high/mE0 mice, even though the former had 4-fold higher plasma triglyceride levels than the latter (Table I). Thus, VLDL triglyceride overproduction is only one aspect of the mechanism(s) responsible for the severe HTG in E3high/mE0/LDLR0 mice. The increase in plasma triglycerides and VLDL cholesterol with the simultaneous decrease in LDL and HDL cholesterol in the presence of increasing levels of apoE3 in the E3high/mE0/LDLR1 and E3high/mE0/LDLR0 mice raised the possibility that the accumulation of apoE3 impaired the lipolytic conversion of VLDL to LDL, as previously suggested for apoE2 (23Huang Y.

To test this hypothesis, we examined the abilities of normal and transgenic VLDL containing various amounts of apoE3 (Table I) to serve as substrates for lipase-mediated lipolysis in vitro (Fig. 3 A). Accumulation of apoE3 in transgenic VLDL from E3high/mE0, E3high/mE0/LDLR1, and E3high/mE0/LDLR0 mice inhibited LPL-mediated lipolysis by 48, 83, and 86%, respectively, compared with the VLDL from nontransgenic mice. Hepatic lipase–mediated lipolysis was affected to a lesser degree. Thus, apoE3-enriched VLDL, like apoE2-enriched VLDL (23Huang Y. Liu X.Q. Rall Jr., S.C. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17483-17490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), are a poorer substrate for LPL-mediated lipolysis than normal VLDL. The inhibitory effect of apoE3 on lipolysis was confirmed by adding increasing amounts of purified human apoE3 to nontransgenic VLDL (Fig. 3 B). More than 90% of LPL-mediated lipolysis was inhibited at the highest apoE3 levels. To explain the inhibitory effect of apoE3 on lipolysis, we found that apoC-II content in the transgenic VLDL decreased gradually with increasing amounts of apoE3 (Table I), suggesting that apoE3 accumulation in the VLDL may displace apoC-II (34de Silva H.V.

Chem. 1994; 269: 2324-2335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a well-defined cofactor for LPL activity (35Hospattankar A.V. Fairwell T. Ronan R. Brewer Jr., H.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 318-322Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To address this possibility, we added purified human apoC-II to various VLDL and determined its effects on lipolysis (Fig. 3 C). Adding apoC-II to apoE3-enriched VLDL stimulated LPL-mediated lipolysis in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that apoE3-impaired lipolysis of VLDL can be at least partially corrected by increasing the amount of apoC-II on the particles. To test apoE involvement in the development of HTG in humans, we examined plasma samples from 27 patients with HTG and six normal controls (Table III). Consistent with previous reports (3Brunzell J.D. Albers J.J. Chait A. Grundy S.M. Groszek E. McDonald G.B. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 147-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Cohn J.S.

Biol. 1996; 16: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the HTG subjects had increased plasma triglycerides, increased VLDL cholesterol and triglycerides, and decreased HDL cholesterol (Table III; compare Fig. 4, A and B). Plasma apoE levels were 2.5–4-fold higher in the HTG patients than in normal control subjects, suggesting that overexpression and/or accumulation of apoE occurs in the HTG patients. As in apoE3 transgenic mice, plasma triglyceride levels and plasma or VLDL apoE levels were positively correlated (Fig. 2 C), as were increased plasma triglyceride levels and VLDL apoE (r = 0.94, p < 0.001). Furthermore, plasma or VLDL apoE correlated negatively with VLDL lipolysis (Fig. 2 D) and HDL cholesterol levels (r = −0.51, p < 0.001 and r = −0.55, p < 0.001, respectively) (Table III). These data suggest that accumulation of apoE in the VLDL of HTG patients also impairs LPL-mediated lipolysis.Table IIILipid and apoE levels in plasma and VLDL from normal or type IV hyperlipidemic human subjectsPlasmaVLDLVLDL lipolysisnApoETCVLDL-TCHDL-TCTGVLDL-TGApoEApoC-IImg/dlμg/mg TGnmol FFA/hI .

Purified human apoC-II (16 μg) was added to VLDL (30 μg of triglycerides) isolated from plasma of type IV-2 subjects and its effect on LPL-mediated lipolysis was determined. To confirm that the increase in apoE impairs LPL-mediated lipolysis, we compared the lipolytic conversion of VLDL to LDL in HTG plasma with that in normal plasma. Autologous VLDL were added to normal plasma to increase VLDL triglyceride to the level in the HTG plasma (compare Fig. 4, B and D). We then added 4 μg of LPL to each of the samples and incubated them at 37 °C for 1 h. As shown in Fig. 4, C versus E, the VLDL in the HTG plasma were resistant to lipolytic processing compared with VLDL in normal plasma. To determine whether the increased plasma apoE levels cause or result from increased triglycerides, purified human apoE3 was added to normal control plasma to levels similar to those in the HTG patients (14 mg/dl), and the effects of the increased apoE3 on VLDL lipolysis were determined. The increased apoE3 in the VLDL (2.5-fold) resulted in a 3-fold reduction in the apoC-II content of the VLDL and a marked impairment of LPL-mediated lipolysis of the VLDL (Table III). Furthermore, apoE3 added to control plasma containing autologous VLDL resulted in an impaired lipolytic processing of VLDL to LDL (compare Fig. 4, E and F). In contrast, adding apoC-II to the VLDL from HTG patients (Type IV-2+apoC-II, Table III) returned lipolysis to nearly normal levels. Taken together, these results indicate that HTG patients have a disturbance in lipoprotein metabolism similar to that of transgenic mice overexpressing apoE3 on either the mE0 or LDLR0 background (i.e. increased plasma and VLDL apoE, elevated plasma triglycerides and VLDL, decreased HDL, impaired VLDL lipolysis, and probably also increased VLDL triglyceride production) (2Chait A. Albers J.J. Brunzell J.D. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 10: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 7Nikkilä E.A. Horm. Metab. Res. Suppl. 1974; 4: 29-34Google Scholar). Our combined mouse and human data imply that overexpression and accumulation of apoE cause HTG by stimulating VLDL triglyceride production and by impairing VLDL lipolysis. Several other lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, clinical studies have shown that plasma apoE concentrations account for 20–40% of the variability of triglyceride levels in humans (13Salah D. Bohnet K. Gueguen R. Siest G. Visvikis S. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 904-912Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicating an important role of apoE in modulating plasma triglyceride levels. Second, apoE-deficient mouse hepatocytes, in vitro and in vivo, have impaired secretion of VLDL triglycerides, suggesting a physiological role for apoE in the VLDL assembly-secretion process (26Kuipers F. Jong M.C. Lin Y. van Eck M. Havinga R. Bloks V. Verkade H.J. Hofker M.H. Moshage H. van Berkel T.J.C. Vonk R.J. Havekes L.M. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2915-2922Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Thus, overexpression of apoE in the liver may stimulate VLDL production, leading to increased VLDL triglyceride secretion, as demonstrated in apoE3 transgenic mice and apoE-transfected hepatocytes in this study and in HTG patients. Third, apoE inhibits lipolysis in vitro(36Gómez-Coronado D. Sáez G.T. Lasunción M.A. Herrera E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1167: 70-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 37Rensen P.C.N. van Berkel T.J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14791-14799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), and plasma from HTG patients displays decreased LPL-cofactor activity for apoC-II (38Kashyap M.L. Srivastava L.S. Chen C.Y. Perisutti G. Campbell M. Lutmer R.F. Glueck C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1977; 60: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in this study, the ratio of apoE to apoC-II in VLDL may be a critical determinant for LPL-mediated lipolysis of VLDL. The low levels of HDL cholesterol in the apoE3-overexpressing mice are also common in HTG patients (1Goldstein J.L. Schrott H.G. Hazzard W.R. Bierman E.L. Motulsky A.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 1544-1568Crossref PubMed Scopus (1102) Google Scholar, 2Chait A. Albers J.J. Brunzell J.D. Eur. J. Clin. Invest. 1980; 10: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 3Brunzell J.D. Albers J.J. Chait A. Grundy S.M. Groszek E. McDonald G.B. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 147-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Impairment of VLDL lipolysis by apoE enrichment provides a partial logical explanation for this phenomenon. Since the formation of at least a portion of HDL particles requires the surface components of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins released during lipolytic processing (39Eisenberg S. J. Lipid Res. 1984; 25: 1017-1058Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), apoE accumulation–associated impairment of lipolysis would lead to less release of surface components from the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, which in turn would decrease the production of HDL particles. Recently, a mouse model of familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) was established by overexpressing the human apoC-III transgene on a LDL receptor knockout background (CIII/LDLR0) (40Masucci-Magoulas L. Goldberg I.J. Bisgaier C.L. Serajuddin H. Francone O.L. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). These mice displayed several characteristics of human FCHL, including increased plasma levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, VLDL, and LDL. The CIII/LDLR0 mice and our E3high/mE0/LDLR0 mice have both similarities and differences. Plasma levels of triglycerides and VLDL were increased in both, but LDL were increased in the CIII/LDLR0 mice and decreased in the E3high/mE0/LDLR0 mice. The differences in LDL concentrations, also a major phenotypic difference between human FCHL and HTG, may reflect the different metabolic impacts of apoC-III and apoE. Apolipoprotein C-III raises plasma levels of triglycerides by delaying the clearance of VLDL (25Aalto-Setälä K. Fisher E.A. Chen X. Chajek-Shaul T. Hayek T. Zechner R. Walsh A. Ramakrishnan R.

Science. 1990; 249: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar) and chylomicrons (34de Silva H.V. Lauer S.J. Wang J. Simonet W.S. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2324-2335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), probably by displacing apoE from the particles (34de Silva H.V. Lauer S.J. Wang J. Simonet W.S. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Taylor J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2324-2335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The increased VLDL will be converted by lipolysis to LDL, leading to increased LDL levels, especially when there is low LDL receptor activity (40Masucci-Magoulas L. Goldberg I.J. Bisgaier C.L. Serajuddin H. Francone O.L. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 391-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In contrast, apoE is a ligand for the LDL receptor, cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and the LDL receptor–related protein (12Mahley R.W. Isr. J. Med. Sci. 1996; 32: 414-429PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, apoE accumulation in the VLDL would effectively mediate the clearance of the VLDL from plasma and, at the same time, impair lipolytic processing of the VLDL to LDL. The combined effect of apoE on VLDL clearance and lipolysis would result in decreased LDL. In fact, plasma LDL cholesterol levels in HTG patients are normal or slightly decreased (3Brunzell J.D. Albers J.J. Chait A. Grundy S.M. Groszek E. McDonald G.B. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 147-155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Cohn J.S. Tremblay M. Amiot M. Bouthillier D. Roy M. Genest Jr., J. Davignon J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Finally, impairment of VLDL lipolysis by apoE accumulation may also contribute to the development of HTG in FCHL patients. Significantly increased levels of plasma and VLDL apoE were observed in FCHL patients (14Cohn J.S. Tremblay M. Amiot M. Bouthillier D. Roy M. Genest Jr., J. Davignon J. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 149-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and FCHL mice (40Masucci-Magoulas L. Goldberg I.J. Bisgaier C.L. Serajuddin H. Francone O.L. Breslow J.L. Tall A.R.

Cell. 1992; 71: 343-353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1878) Google Scholar), our data indicate that optimal expression of apoE is crucial for maintaining normal metabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Too little apoE impairs the clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and their remnants from plasma. Too much apoE stimulates VLDL triglyceride production in the liver and impairs LPL-mediated lipolysis, leading to HTG. Our HTG mice with apoE3 overexpression and accumulation appear to be valuable models of the HTG phenotype and should be useful for future studies of this disorder and possible therapies. Our studies suggest that the regulatory elements of the apoE gene may be potential therapeutic targets. We thank Dr. Karl H.

Based on logistical and theoretical hemodynamic arguments, the luminal cell surface of the endothelium directly exposed to the circulation is expected to be a critical interface immediately involved in the transduction of fluid forces in vivo. The existence of a flow-sensing, mechanotransducing element on this endothelial plasma membrane seems likely but, as yet, remains unproven. Caveolae are specialized invaginated microdomains that appear on the cell surface on many cell types and are especially abundant in certain vascular endothelia. They contain key protein mediators of vesicle formation, docking, and fusion (16Schnitzer J.E. Liu J. Oh P. J Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 14399-14404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and have been shown to form discrete carrier vesicles capable of budding directly from the luminal plasmalemma (17Schnitzer J.E.

Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 101-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). Thus, caveolae may serve as dynamic carriers for the intracellular and transvascular transport of blood macromolecules within endothelial cells. In addition, caveolae have been implicated in the organization of cell surface signaling molecules (17Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. McIntosh D.P. Science. 1996; 274: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 19Lisanti M.P. Scherer P.E. Tang Z. Sargiacomo M.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7211-7222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). The localization of signaling molecules within a small microdomain is likely to provide the proximity necessary for rapid, efficient, and specific propagation of signals to downstream targets. Endothelial cells have remarkable plasticity with the ability to modulate their constitutive phenotype in response to local tissue milieu (22Schnitzer J.E. Born G.V.R. Schwartz C.J. Vascular Endothelium: Physiology, Pathology and Therapeutic Opportunities. Schattauer, Stuttgart1997: 77-95Google Scholar) so that when grown in culture, they adopt a “de-differentiated” phenotype. Although endothelial cells are investigated best under “native” conditions, which cannot yet be duplicated in culture, they constitute, even in most highly vascularized organs, only a small percentage of the tissue cells, which makes isolating their plasma membranes using classic techniques impractical. Here, we use a silica-coating methodology to purify and then subfractionate the endothelial plasma membrane directly from tissue to focus on the effects of fluid flow directly on the luminal endothelial cell surface in situ. We find that increased fluid flow through the rat lung vasculature in situ induced very rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins on the luminal endothelial cell surface, with the majority of these proteins residing within the caveolar microdomain. This induced signaling cascade appears to require intact assembled caveolae and local translocation of key signaling molecules, leading to activation of the Ras-Raf-MAP1 kinase pathway. Thus, mechanotransduction does occur in tissue at the luminal endothelial cell surface and may require caveolae for efficient signal propagation. These studies are the first to describe mechanotransduction events as they occur on the luminal endothelial cell surface and its caveolae in situ and thus provide a new focus for defining the molecular events mediating mechanotransduction. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (150–200 g) were anesthetized with a 3:1 mixture of 10 mg/ml ketamine and 10 mg/ml xylazine per 100 g body weight. Following tracheotomy and thoracotomy, the lungs were inflated with approximately ¾ tidal volume. The pericardium was removed, and 200 units of heparin was injected into the right ventricle as an anticoagulant. After the thymus was removed to fully expose the pulmonary artery, a small cut was made in the right ventricle, through which a catheter was fed and secured into the pulmonary artery. The left atrium was cut to allow for outflow, and vascular fluid flow (mammalian Ringer's solution at 37 °C) was immediately established through the rat lungs at a predetermined rate and time of delivery using a variable speed pump (Bio-Rad) connected to a buffer reservoir. At the conclusion of the perfusion experiments, the vasculature was immediately cooled to 10 °C by perfusion with 20 mm MES-buffered saline (pH 6.0) (23Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). In some experiments, rat lungs were perfused with or without filipin (5 μg/ml for 90 s) prior to flow stimulation. Pressure and flow rates were measured during perfusion of the lung. A flow rate of 4–5 ml/min produced pressures of 8–10 mmHg, whereas 10 and 12 ml/min gave 18–20 and 22–24 mmHg, respectively. For each independent experiment, rat lung samples were acquired on the same day, and two to four independent experiments were performed for each study, as indicated. Immediately following perfusion and cooling of the rat lung vasculature as described above, the luminal endothelial cell plasma membranes and then their caveolae were purified using anin situ silica-coating procedure described previously (23Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Briefly, a positively charged colloidal silica solution was perfused through the rat lung vasculature to selectively coat the luminal endothelial cell plasma membranes. Cross-linking of the silica particles by subsequent perfusion with polyacrylic acid created a stable adherent silica pellicle that marked this specific membrane of interest. This coating was firmly attached to the plasma membrane, greatly increased its density, and thus permitted purification by centrifugation of the silica-coated endothelial cell plasma membranes (P) from the whole lung homogenates (H). The silica-coated membrane pellets have many associated caveolae and display ample enrichment for various endothelial cell surface markers (22Schnitzer J.E. Born G.V.R. Schwartz C.J. Vascular Endothelium: Physiology, Pathology and Therapeutic Opportunities. Schattauer, Stuttgart1997: 77-95Google Scholar, 23Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The attached caveolae were sheared away from P and purified by sucrose gradient flotation (23Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 24Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Jacobson B.S. Dvorak A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1759-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). A membrane band (V) was easily detected at a density of 15–20% sucrose and contained a homogeneous population of caveolae amply enriched in caveolar markers and greatly depleted in noncaveolar markers (22Schnitzer J.E. Born G.V.R. Schwartz C.J. Vascular Endothelium: Physiology, Pathology and Therapeutic Opportunities. Schattauer, Stuttgart1997: 77-95Google Scholar, 23Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J.

A. 1995; 92: 1759-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The remaining silica-coated membrane pellet stripped of caveolae was labeled P-V. Membrane vesicles were immuno-affinity isolated from V through the presence of phosphotyrosine residues associated with the membrane vesicles, as described in our past work (16Schnitzer J.E. Liu J. Oh P. J Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 14399-14404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 21Liu J. Oh P. Horner T. Rogers R.A. Schnitzer J.E. J. Biol.

Briefly, PY-20 antibodies (10 μg; Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) were pre-absorbed onto goat anti-mouse IgG-coated magnetic beads (Dynal; Oslo, Norway) by incubation for 4 h at 4 °C. The antibody-bead conjugates were subsequently washed three times by sedimentation and resuspension to remove excess antibody and blocked with 0.01% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 4 °C. Purified caveolae (10–15 μg total protein) derived from different flow conditions were added to the conjugates and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. Beads with any attached membranes (B) were separated magnetically from unbound material (U) and then processed for SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-caveolin antibodies. As in our past work (16Schnitzer J.E. Liu J. Oh P. J Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 14399-14404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 23Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), proteins (2–15 μg) from tissue subfractions, such as H, P, V, and P-V, were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (5–15% gradient gels) followed by electrotransfer to nitrocellulose membranes before immunoblotting using primary and reporter antibodies detected by enhanced chemiluminescence detection. Primary antibodies used included PY-20, Ras, Raf, Lyn, and caveolin-1 (Transduction Laboratories). For examination of mitogen-activated protein kinases, 30 μg of H was separated, transferred, and probed using pan-ERK (Transduction Laboratories) or active mitogen-activated protein kinase (Promega) primary antibodies. Autoradiograms were scanned and digitized (Molecular Dynamics), and band intensities were quantified (16Schnitzer J.E. Liu J. Oh P. J Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 14399-14404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 22Schnitzer J.E. Born G.V.R. Schwartz C.J.

Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). The digital images were transferred to a Macintosh Power PC and printed using Adobe Photoshop software. We developed and characterized an in situ system designed to examine signal transduction events initiated in response to changes in fluid mechanical forces within vascular endothelium. The rat lung vasculature was perfused in situ via the pulmonary artery within the normal physiological range of pressure (0–24 mmHg) resulting in a range of flow rates from 0 to 12 ml/min. After rapid cooling, we used the silica-coating technique to purify the luminal endothelial cell plasma membranes (P) directly from the tissue (see “Materials and Methods”). This strategy allowed us to focus on the effects of increased flow on the vascular endothelium under physiologically relevant conditions found in the body. It avoids potential artifacts induced by isolating and growing endothelial cells in culture outside their normal tissue environment. We found that several proteins residing on the luminal endothelial cell plasma membranes (P) became tyrosine phosphorylation in response to increasing flow (Fig. 1 A). This phosphorylation was difficult to detect in the corresponding starting whole lung homogenates (H) of the same rat lung sample, consistent with the known enrichment of endothelial cell surface proteins in P (22Schnitzer J.E. Born G.V.R. Schwartz C.J. Vascular Endothelium: Physiology, Pathology and Therapeutic Opportunities. Schattauer, Stuttgart1997: 77-95Google Scholar, 23Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 24Schnitzer J.E. Oh P. Jacobson B.S. Dvorak A.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1759-1763Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The protein-tyrosine phosphorylation detected in P increased with greater flow rates and pressures. Both the number of proteins phosphorylated and the degree to which they became phosphorylated increased significantly on the luminal endothelial cell surface (see arrows in Fig. 1 A). Densitometry revealed that even small increases in flow rate and pressure from 4–5 ml/min to 6 ml/min (8–10 mmHg to 12–14 mmHg) caused an overall average increase of 1.9 ± 0.6-fold in total protein-tyrosine phosphorylation detected in P. Doubling flow rates and pressures to 9 ml/min (18–20 mmHg) caused an average increase of 8.8 ± 1.7-fold that did not increase further at 12 ml/min (22–24 mmHg). Under no flow conditions, the detected phosphorylation was minimal, which suggested that normal flow rate and pressure might maintain a basal level of endothelial cell surface stimulation in situ. The protein-tyrosine phosphorylation induced by flow occurred very rapidly and required only 1 min to achieve a maximum total response, as quantified and depicted in Fig. 1 B. Analysis of the individual endothelial cell surface proteins as resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting revealed that the phosphorylation of a group of proteins with apparent molecular masses of 180, 120, 90, 58, and 48/50 kDa was acutely sensitive to flow (Fig. 1). Quantification of the phosphotyrosine signals detected for each individual protein showed that maximal flow-induced phosphorylation occurred within 1 min, with an average enhancement of 2.6 ± 0.6-fold for p180, 2.4 ± 0.5-fold for p58, 2.4 ± 0.3-fold for p90, 2.5 ± 0.2-fold for p120, and 5.4 ± 0.9-fold for p48/50 over the signal detected at 8–10 mmHg (4–5 ml/min) (Fig. 1 C). Slower responding proteins at 25 and 15 kDa were also observed in some experiments. These latter proteins were usually nonresponsive to flow, failing to demonstrate any detectable level of phosphorylation (Fig. 2, lanes P). When detected, they required much greater rates of flow and times near 10 min to induce their phosphorylation (Fig. 1 C). These in situ experiments demonstrated, for the first time, the acute flow-dependent mechanotransduction effects of increasing hemodynamic forces on the membrane directly exposed to vascular flow, namely the luminal endothelial cell surface. Using a selective subfractionation procedure developed for isolating caveolae from P to high purity (21Liu J. Oh P. Horner T. Rogers R.A. Schnitzer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7211-7222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 23Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), the few proteins containing immunodetectable phosphotyrosine under 4 ml/min flow conditions were localized primarily within caveolae (Fig. 2, left panel, lane V). These proteins, as well as others, seemed to become significantly more phosphorylated with increased flow. The majority of proteins that were rapidly phosphorylated in response to enhanced flow could be found in the caveolae (Fig. 2, right panel, lane V). Comparisons, by densitometry, of total protein-tyrosine phosphorylation between endothelial luminal membrane subfractions isolated from rat lungs subjected to high flow (10 ml/min) revealed that an average of 8.4 ± 1.7 more signal in the caveolae (V) than P as well as a 20-fold increase relative to the plasma membrane stripped of caveolae (P-V). The phosphotyrosine signal present in P was, on average, 2.8 ± 1.3-fold greater than that found in P-V in these same high flow samples, further substantiating the observation that the majority of flow-sensitive proteins reside in the caveolae. The few phosphorylated proteins remaining in P-V were also detected in V and thus may represent flow-sensitive proteins residing within the residual caveolae (about 5–10%) that remain associated with the luminal plasma membrane following subfractionation (16Schnitzer J.E. Liu J. Oh P. J Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 14399-14404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 23Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Alternatively, these proteins may be common to both caveolae and the luminal endothelial cell surface proper. In addition, the enrichment ratio (V/P-V) for individual proteins varied from an average of 3.3 ± 1.1 for the 120-kDa protein to 26.4 ± 4.8 for the 48/50-kDa proteins. The more slowly phosphorylated proteins at 25 and 15 kDa, when detected in P, could not be detected in V and remained in P-V (data not shown). As reported previously (16Schnitzer J.E. Liu J. Oh P. J Biol Chem. 1995; 270: 14399-14404Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 23Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), caveolin was enriched 15–25-fold in V relative to P. Consistent with our previous observations for many proteins found enriched in caveolae (23Schnitzer J.E. McIntosh D.P. Dvorak A.M. Liu J. Oh P. Science. 1995; 269: 1435-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), the profile of phosphorylated proteins in caveolae remained quite similar whether we purified the caveolae in the presence or absence of detergent (data not shown), indicating a significant resistance of the phosphorylated proteins to Triton X-100 solubilization. Immuno-affinity isolations performed on the caveolae in V confirmed that the phosphorylated proteins existed in the same caveolar vesicles rich in caveolin (Fig. 3). Consistent with the protein phosphorylation detected at 8–10 mmHg with 4–5 ml/min of flow (Figs. 1 A and 2), only 25% of the caveolae were able to bind to the phosphotyrosine antibody beads. After increased pressure and flow (18–20 mmHg at 10 ml/min), the percentage of caveolae in the bound fraction of the immuno-isolates increased to >95%. Thus, the tyrosine phosphorylation of endothelial cell surface proteins induced by increased flow, and pressure seemed to occur in nearly all the caveolae found in V, consistent with the vast majority of the endothelial cell surface caveolae exhibiting mechanosensitivity. In addition, caveolae immuno-isolated using caveolin antibody also contained the flow-induced tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of the same apparent molecular weight as those observed in Fig. 2 (data not shown). It is interesting that many of the endothelial cell surface proteins that are tyrosine phosphorylated by ligands (21Liu J. Oh P. Horner T. Rogers R.A. Schnitzer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7211-7222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar) seem to be similar to those observed in these studies, which suggests a parallel between ligand-induced signaling and mechanotransduction at the endothelial luminal cell surface. We have reported that endothelial cell mitogens and chemokines such as VEGF, basic fibroblast growth factor, insulin, endothelin-1, and platelet-derived growth factor were effective in producing protein-tyrosine phosphorylation (21Liu J. Oh P. Horner T. Rogers R.A. Schnitzer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7211-7222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Even though platelet-derived growth factor caused the greatest degree of ligand-induced phosphorylation, we found that only about half of endothelial cell caveolae in V contained tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins after platelet-derived growth factor stimulation (21Liu J. Oh P. Horner T. Rogers R.A. Schnitzer J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7211-7222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). These data suggest that only a subset of caveolae is involved in ligand-specific signaling and contains the ligand's receptor, which is capable of initiating signaling within these caveola. However, flow-induced signaling seems to occur in nearly all of the caveolae (Fig. 3), which distinguishes mechanotransduction apart from growth factor-stimulated signaling. Thus, flow-induced signaling within caveolae may be the result of the activation of a single, yet to be identified, mechanosensing molecule found in all caveolae or, more likely, the summation of several, yet unidentified, proteins that have mechanosensing and signaling capabilities. Currently, the distal aspects of the signaling cascade elicited in response to mechanical stimuli, namely the effects of flow on molecular events at or near the nucleus, are better understood than more proximal signaling events at or near the plasma membrane. The role of shear stress response elements as well as flow-induced transcription factors and gene expression has been well described (6Resnick N. Gimbrone M.A. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 874-882Crossref PubMed Scopus (471) Google Scholar, 15Malek A.M. Izumo S.

Pathol. 1996; 148: 427-438PubMed Google Scholar). Many of these nuclear events are regulated by the MAP kinase pathway, which can be activated in cultured endothelial cell monolayers by shear forces (12Jo H. Sipos K. Go Y.-M. Law R. Rong J. McDonald J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1395-1401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar, 28Tseng H. Peterson T.E. Berk B.C. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 869-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Little is known about flow-induced signaling events between the MAP kinase pathway and the cell surface, especiallyin situ, where it is unknown whether MAP kinase is stimulated by flow. With this background in mind, we examined our preparations for flow-induced activation of the MAP kinase pathway and upstream effectors of this pathway. As shown in Fig. 4 A, increased flow through the pulmonary artery did indeed activate MAP kinases in a time-dependent manner, as detected in the rat lung homogenate. This in situ activation was detected as early as 30 s, reached a maximum increase of 15-fold at 3 min, and quickly declined to 3-fold above baseline, which was sustained after 10 min. Past work has shown that the MAP kinase pathway could become activated when cytosolic Raf binds to activated GTP-charged Ras resulting in its translocation to the plasma membrane, clustering, and kinase activation (29Luo Z. Tzivion G. Belshaw P.J. Vavvas D. Marshall M. Avruch J. Nature. 1996; 383: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 30Farrar M.A. Alberola-Ila J. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 178-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Consistent with this activation process, we found that Raf was rapidly translocated to the plasma membrane (P) as a consequence of increased flow (Fig. 5 A). More specifically, Raf was detected, along with caveolin, in the caveolae (V) subfraction (Fig. 5 B). As quantified in Fig. 4 B, a peak 10-fold increase of Raf was detected in P after 3 min of doubled flow and pressure (10 ml/min at 18–20 mmHg). Although the Raf signal rapidly decreased, it remained 3.2 times greater than lower pressure and flow (8–10 mmHg at 4–5 ml/min) after 10 min of increased flow (9–10 ml/min), whereas the caveolin signal remained unchanged (Fig. 5 B). Thus, these results are consistent with flow-initiated signaling through caveolae via Raf translocation to the caveolae, which, in turn, activates MAP kinase.Figure 5Cytosolic signaling molecules translocate to plasma membrane and caveolae in response to flow.

The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria is a barrier to many antibiotics and host defense factors (1Vaara M. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 395-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The outer leaflet of this membrane is composed almost exclusively of lipopolysaccharide (LPS),1 a unique glycolipid with structural features essential to outer membrane stability. InEscherichia coli and Salmonella enterica, the LPS molecule is conceptually divided into three distinct regions: 1) a hydrophobic membrane anchor designated lipid A; 2) a short chain of sugar residues with multiple phosphoryl substituents, referred to as the core oligosaccharide (core OS); and 3) a structurally diverse polymer composed of oligosaccharide repeats, termed the O antigen. Lipid A and the core OS are synthesized together as a single unit (lipid A-core, Fig. 1), which serves as an acceptor for preformed O antigen to yield the completed LPS molecule (2Whitfield C.

Bacterial Endotoxic Lipopolysaccharides. I. CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fl1992: 134-170Google Scholar, 5Olsthoorn M.M.A. Petersen B.O. Schlecht S. Haverkamp J. Bock K. Thomas-Oates J.E. Holst O. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3817-3829Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The genes responsible for biosynthesis of the core OS in these bacteria are clustered on the chromosome in the waa (formerly rfa) locus near 81 min on the E. coli K-12 and S. entericalinkage maps. Mutations in many of the glycosyl transferases encoded by this locus result in the production of LPS lacking O antigen (termed rough or R-LPS) since O antigen cannot be ligated to an incomplete lipid A-core acceptor molecule. Strains that produce only R-LPS are more susceptible to complement-mediated serum killing than their wild-type counterparts (reviewed in Ref. 6Whitfield C. Keenleyside W.J. Clarke B.R. Gyles C.L. Escherichia coli in Domestic Animals and Man. CAB International, 1994: 437-494Google Scholar). Mutations in thewaa locus that specifically affect the phosphoryl substitution of the core OS heptose region (Fig. 1) can significantly alter outer membrane permeability, giving rise to a pleiotropic phenotype called deep-rough (7Helander I.M.

C.1996: 29-47Google Scholar). Characteristics of the deep-rough phenotype include the following: 1) hypersensitivity to detergents and hydrophobic antibiotics, 2) sloughing of LPS from the outer membrane, 3) leakage of periplasmic proteins into the culture medium, and 4) a marked decrease in the protein content of the outer membrane (reviewed in Ref. 9Schnaitman C.A. Klena J.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 655-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphoryl substituents in the heptose region are postulated to be so critical to outer membrane stability because their negative charge allows neighboring LPS molecules to be cross-linked by divalent cations (1Vaara M. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 56: 395-411Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Nikaido H. Vaara M. Microbiol. Rev. 1985; 49: 1-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given its crucial role in outer membrane stability, the assembly of the heptose portion of the LPS molecule provides potential targets for novel therapeutic compounds. Development of such therapeutic strategies is limited, however, because the enzymology involved in the heptose region assembly is poorly understood. Previous studies with S. enterica serovars Minnesota (11Dröge W. Ruschmann E. Lüderitz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 4: 134-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar,12Mühlradt P.

Mäkelä P.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and with E. coli K-12 (13Parker C.T. Kloser A.W. Schnaitman C.A. Stein M.A. Gottesman S. Gibson B.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2525-2538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have implicated waaP in the phosphorylation of both HepI and HepII (Fig. 1). Mutation of waaP in these organisms was also reported to cause characteristics of the deep-rough phenotype. Furthermore, in E. coli K-12, waaP has been implicated in the addition of HepIII (Fig. 1). Interpretation of these data, however, has been complicated by their reliance on strains with poorly defined or polar mutations. The goal of this study was to identify unequivocally the genes involved in modification of the inner core HepI and HepII residues and to determine the precise contribution of the corresponding gene products to the biosynthesis of the inner core heptose region. The R1 core is the most prevalent among clinical isolates of E. coli (14Appelmelk B.J. An Y.-Q. Hekker T.A.M. Thijs L.G. MacLaren D.M. de Graaf J.

Biochem. 1981; 115: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) and the genetics of its outer portion have been resolved (see Fig. 2 A) 2Heinrichs, D. E., Yethon, J. A., Amor, P. A., and Whitfield, C. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, in press. studies were performed using the prototype E. coli R1 strain, F470. A precise, non-polar insertion mutation was made in the waaPgene of E. coli F470 to unequivocally establish the role of its gene product in modification of the heptose region. Furthermore, additional functions originally assigned to the waaP gene product were shown to be encoded by two genes (waaY and waaQ) whose functions were previously unknown. E. coliF470 is an R-LPS derivative of an O8:K27 strain (18Schmidt G. Jann B. Jann K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1969; 10: 501-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and serves as the prototype for R1 core OS studies. Derivatives of F470 used in this study include CWG296 (F470 with a waaP::aacC1insertion), CWG297 (F470 with a waaQ::aacC1insertion), and CWG312 (F470 with a waaY::aacC1insertion). Bacteria were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth at 37 °C. Growth media were supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml), gentamicin (15 μg/ml), or chloramphenicol (30 μg/ml) when necessary. ThewaaY, waaQ, and waaP genes of the R1 core OS biosynthesis region were independently mutated by insertion of a non-polar gentamicin resistance cassette (the aacC1 gene from Tn1696). Briefly, each of the genes (with some flanking DNA) was individually PCR amplified, cloned into the pBluescript II SK(+) phagemid (Stratagene), and sequenced to ensure error-free amplification. The aacC1 gene from plasmid pUCGM (19Schweizer H.P. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 831-833PubMed Google Scholar) was then inserted into an appropriate site (near the middle) of the coding region of each gene (Fig. 2 B). The DNA fragment containing the insertionally inactivated gene was subsequently cloned into the suicide delivery vector pMAK705 (20Hamilton C.M. Aldea M. Washburn B.K. Babtizke P. Kushner S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 4617-4622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and chromosomal gene replacement was performed as described previously (21Amor P.A. Whitfield C. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 26: 145-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Mutations were verified by PCR amplification of the mutated gene from the chromosome and confirmed by sequencing. Restriction endonuclease digestion and ligation were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (22Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., New England Biolabs, or Boehringer Mannheim. Plasmids were introduced intoE. coli strains by electroporation using a Gene Pulser from Bio-Rad. Chromosomal DNA isolation was performed using the Qiagen genomic DNA isolation kit, and plasmid DNA was prepared using QIAprep Miniprep spin columns (Qiagen Inc., Santa Clarita, CA). When necessary, DNA fragments were isolated from agarose gels using the Geneclean kit from Bio/Can Scientific (Mississauga, Ontario). Oligonucleotides were synthesized using a Perkin-Elmer 394 DNA synthesizer, and sequencing was performed using an ABI 377 DNA sequencing apparatus (Perkin-Elmer) in the Guelph Molecular Supercentre at the University of Guelph. PCR amplification was performed using a GeneAmp PCR System 2400 from Perkin-Elmer. The PwoI DNA polymerase enzyme (Boehringer Mannheim) was used as recommended by the manufacturer. Oligonucleotide primers for the amplification of waaP from the F470 chromosome were designed to introduce appropriate restriction sites for cloning. The forward primer (5′-TGTGGATccAAATAGTGGGCACTCA-3′) introduced aBamHI site (underlined) 32 base pairs downstream of thewaaP stop codon, and the complementary reverse primer (5′-GGGTGGTCcatATGGTTGAACTTAA-3′) introduced anNdeI site (underlined) overlapping the waaP start codon (bases shown in lowercase indicate mismatches between the primer and chromosomal sequences). The coding region for waaP alone was subsequently isolated as a BamHI-NdeI fragment and cloned behind the arabinose-inducible PBADpromoter of the expression vector pBAD18 (23Guzman L.-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3960) Google Scholar) to generate plasmid pWQ909. l-Arabinose was used at a final concentration of 0.002% to induce expression of WaaP from plasmid pWQ909. Homology searches of nucleotide and amino acid sequences in the National Center for Biotechnology Information data bases were performed using the BLAST (basiclocal alignment searchtool) or PSI (position-specificiterated)-BLAST server analysis programs (24Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70762) Google Scholar, 25Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59933) Google Scholar). Pairwise nucleotide sequence alignments and percent identity scores were obtained using the NALIGN program of the PC/Gene software package (IntelliGenetics, Inc., Mountain View, CA) with an open gap cost of 25 and a unit gap cost of 5. Multiple protein alignments and percentage identity and similarity scores were obtained using the PC/Gene program CLUSTALV, with an open gap cost of 10 and a unit gap cost of 10. Routine DNA and protein sequence manipulations were performed using the MacVector and AssemblyLIGN software packages (International Biotechnologies, Inc., New Haven, CT). 2-Fold serial dilutions of SDS (200 → 0.1 mg/ml) and novobiocin (200 → 1.6 μg/ml) were made in 5-ml volumes of LB. Each series of tubes was point inoculated from an overnight culture of the strain to be tested and then incubated with shaking at 37 °C. Growth was scored as positive if after 8 h the culture was visibly turbid (i.e. OD600 > 0.2). Water-soluble LPS were obtained by the hot phenol/water extraction of cells (26Westphal O. Jann K. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1965; 5: 83-91Google Scholar) and then treated with 2% acetic acid at 100 °C to cleave the acid-labile ketosidic linkage between the core OS and lipid A. The water-insoluble lipid A was removed by centrifugation (5000 × g, 30 min), and the supernatant was passed through a column of BioGel P-2 (1 m × 1 cm) with water as eluent. The core-containing fractions were collected and lyophilized. Sugar composition analysis was performed by the alditol acetate method (27Sawardeker J.H. Sloneker J.H. Jeanes A. Anal. Chem. 1967; 39: 1602-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds was achieved with 4 mtrifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C for 4 h. The samples were then reduced in water with sodium borodeuteride and acetylated with acetic anhydride using residual sodium acetate as the catalyst. Characterization of the alditol acetate derivatives was performed by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC)-mass spectrometry using a Hewlett-Packard chromatograph equipped with a 30-m DB-17 capillary column (210 °C (30 min) to 240 °C at 2 °C/min). Mass spectrometry in the electron impact mode was recorded using a Varian Saturn II mass spectrometer. Linkage data were interpreted based upon the previously published structure of the R1 core (4Holst O. Brade H. Morrison D.C. Ryan J.L. Bacterial Endotoxic Lipopolysaccharides. I. CRC Press, Boca Raton, Fl1992: 134-170Google Scholar), as described for analysis of the R1 outer core assembly.2 Methylation linkage analyses were carried out by the procedure of Ciucanu and Kerek (28Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3206) Google Scholar). The permethylated alditol acetate derivatives were fully characterized by GLC-mass spectrometry in the electron impact mode using a column of DB-17 operated isothermally at 190 °C for 60 min. A fraction of the methylated sample from the linkage analysis was taken for positive ion FAB-MS, which was performed using a Jeol JMS-AX505H mass spectrometer with glycerol/thioglycerol as the matrix and a tip voltage of 3 kV. 31P NMR spectra were recorded with a Bruker DRX 400 MHz instrument at 161.98 MHz with ortho-phosphoric acid as the external reference (0.0 ppm) and with pI = 30 in the proton-decoupling mode. Prior to performing the NMR experiments, the samples were lyophilized three times in 2H2O (99.9%). The p2H was adjusted with triethylamine when necessary. The established structure of the F470 core OS (Fig. 2 A) served as a framework for the interpretation of our results. Sugar composition analysis detected the presence of all the expected core OS sugars (glucose, galactose, and heptose; data not shown). Methylation linkage analysis of the core OS from F470 showed all of the permethylated alditol acetate derivatives from the outer core residues in the ratios expected (Fig. 3 A and Table I). No peaks were observed in the GLC chromatogram (Fig. 3 A) for the derivatives from either HepI or HepII because the phosphoryl substituents attached to these residues (Fig. 2 A) made their derivatives too polar to elute from the column. This proved useful in subsequent analyses because it allowed the loss of phosphoryl substituents from HepI and HepII to be monitored as the appearance of either a 3-substituted or 3,7-disubstituted heptose derivative peak in the GLC chromatogram.Table IStructures of the core OS from F470 and derivatives as deduced from linkage analysesStrainPeakLinkageApproximate molar ratioCore OS structure HepIIIF470 (parent)1Glc-(1→1.0 12Gal-(1→1.0 ↓4→3)-Glc-(1→0.7 75→2)-Gal-(1→1.3GalI-1→2-GlcII-1→3-GlcI-1→3-HepII-1→3-HepI-1→6Hep-(1→0.6 23 4 47→2,3)-Glc-(1→1.0 ↑↑ ↑ ↑ 11 P P/PPEtNGalII β-Glc HepIIICWG312 (waaY)1Glc-(1→0.9 12Gal-(1→0.8 ↓4→3)-Glc-(1→1.1 75→2)-Gal-(1→1.0GalI-1→2-GlcII-1→3-GlcI-1→3-HepII-1→3-HepI-1→6Hep-(1→0.7 23 47→2,3)-Glc-(1→1.1 ↑↑ ↑9→3,7)-Hep-(1→1.1 11 P/PPEtNGalII β-GlcCWG297 (waaQ)1Glc-(1→0.9GalI-1→2-GlcII-1→3-GlcI-1→3-HepII-1→3-HepI-1→2Gal-(1→1.0 23 44→3)-Glc-(1→1.1 ↑↑ ↑5→2)-Gal-(1→1.0 11 P/PPEtN7→2,3)-Glc-(1→1.1GalII β-Glc8→3)-Hep-(1→0.7CWG296 (waaP)1Glc-(1→0.52Gal-(1→0.9GalI-1→2-GlcII-1→3-GlcI-1→3-HepII-1→3-HepI-1→3→2)-Glc-(1→0.7 234→3)-Glc-(1→1.0 ↑↑5→2)-Gal-(1→1.1 117→2,3)-Glc-(1→0.6GalII β-Glc8→3)-Hep-(1→1.1The peaks in the GLC chromatograms from the linkage analyses (Fig. 3,A–D) were correlated to the substituted sugar residues from which they were derived.

Open table in a new tab The peaks in the GLC chromatograms from the linkage analyses (Fig. 3,A–D) were correlated to the substituted sugar residues from which they were derived. Approximate molar ratios were calculated from the integrated peak areas. The published structure of the F470 core OS (Fig. 2 A) was used as a framework for the interpretation of results as discussed in the text. In CWG296, the β-Glc residue is only present in about 50% of the core OS. 31P NMR spectroscopy of the F470 core OS at p2H 8.5 yielded the spectrum shown in Fig. 3 E. The signal at 5 ppm is indicative of a phosphomonoester (P on either HepI or HepII), whereas the two peaks near −10 ppm are characteristic of a diphosphodiester (PPEtN on HepI) (29Helander I.M. Kilpeläinen I. Vaara M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). At lower solvent p2H values, the peak at 5 ppm was shifted upfield (data not shown), confirming its assignment as a phosphomonoester (29Helander I.M. Kilpeläinen I. Vaara M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 481-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The ratio of P to PPEtN in the F470 core OS was estimated by the relative peak heights in Fig. 3 E. As expected, there was more P than PPEtN, as HepII is only substituted with P while HepI is substituted with either P or PPEtN. Pairwise nucleotide alignments of the waaY coding region from E. coliK-12, R1, R2, and R4 and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium (all of the core types for which DNA sequence of the waaloci was available) showed identities ranging from 59.4 to 99.0%. Multiple alignment of the predicted WaaY proteins showed high total similarity (85.3%) but much lower identity (43.1%). In BLASTP searches of the available data bases, WaaY showed no significant homologies to other characterized proteins. However, using the PSI-BLAST server analysis program, queries with the various WaaY protein sequences suggested biologically relevant similarities to a large number of kinases (data not shown). This circumstantial data suggested a potential role for WaaY in phosphorylation reactions. To test this possibility, strain CWG312 was derived by insertion of theaacC1 gene into the unique SnaBI site in thewaaY coding region of F470 (Fig. 2 B). The LPS from the resulting mutant migrated similarly to that of the F470 parent in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown), precluding any significant effect of the mutation on core OS extension. However, the minimum inhibitory concentrations of SDS and of novobiocin for CWG312 were slightly less than for F470 (Table II), suggesting subtle changes in outer membrane properties.Table IIMinimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of SDS and novobiocin for F470 and derivativesStrainMICSDS (mg/ml)Novobiocin (μg/ml)F470 (parent)>200200CWG312 (waaY)200100CWG297 (waaQ)200100CWG296 (waaP)0.16.3CWG296 (waaP) + pWQ909200100 Open table in a new tab The structure of the deduced CWG312 core OS is shown in Table I. Sugar composition analysis detected the presence of all the core OS sugars found in F470 (data not shown). Linkage analysis of CWG312 resulted in a GLC chromatogram that was identical to that from the F470 parent (compare panels A and B in Fig. 3) except for the appearance of a peak (peak 9, Fig. 3 B) corresponding to a 3,7-disubstituted heptose derivative (Table I). Based on the F470 structure, this derivative must result from unphosphorylated HepII. 31P NMR spectroscopy further corroborated the loss of P from the CWG312 core OS; in the F470 parent, there was more P than PPEtN, but in CWG312 there was slightly more PPEtN than P (compare panels E and F in Fig. 3). The observed shift in the ratio of P to PPEtN is explained by the loss of P from HepII, leaving only P and PPEtN on HepI. Therefore, given the disappearance of P from HepII in the CWG312 core OS and the biologically significant sequence similarity of WaaY to some kinases, WaaY was concluded to be involved in the phosphorylation of HepII. In E. coli K-12, R1, R2, and R4 and in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, waaQ is the first gene of the central operon of the core OS biosynthesis region (Fig. 2 B). Pairwise nucleotide alignments of the waaQ genes from these core types showed identities ranging from 68.5 to 98.6%. Multiple sequence alignment of the predicted WaaQ proteins reflected the homology observed at the nucleotide level with a total similarity of 88.1% (64.0% identity). The predicted WaaQ proteins showed limited homology to both WaaC (40.6% total similarity, 10.8% identity) and WaaF (50.1% total similarity, 16.5% identity), the HepI (30Kadrmas J.L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2799-2807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) and HepII (31Sirisena D.M. MacLachlan P.R. Liu S.-L. Hessel A. Sanderson K.E. J.

Biochem. 1997; 247: 716-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) transferases, respectively (Fig. 2 A). Strain CWG297 was derived by insertion of the aacC1 gene into the unique NruI site in the waaQ coding region of F470 (Fig. 2 B). The LPS from the resulting mutant migrated similarly to that of the F470 parent in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (data not shown), but the minimum inhibitory concentrations of SDS and of novobiocin for CWG297 were slightly less than for F470 (Table II) and comparable with the values for thewaaY mutant, CWG312. Sugar composition analysis detected the presence of all the core OS sugars found in F470 (data not shown). The structure of the CWG297 core OS shown in Table I was deduced from methylation linkage analysis and 31P NMR spectroscopy as follows. First, methylation linkage analysis of the CWG297 core OS showed all of the outer core derivatives in the expected ratios (Table I), but the terminal heptose derivative (resulting from HepIII) was completely absent (note the absence of peak 6 in Fig. 3 C). The disappearance of the HepIII side branch was also confirmed by FAB-MS (data not shown). Given the similarity of WaaQ to WaaC and WaaF (the HepI and HepII transferases, respectively; Fig. 2 A) and the complete absence of HepIII in the CWG297 core OS, it was concluded thatwaaQ encodes the transferase for the branch HepIII residue. Interestingly, the appearance of a 3-linked heptose derivative in the linkage analysis of CWG297 (peak 8, Fig. 3 C) also indicated the loss of a phosphoryl substituent from either HepI or HepII (both are 3-linked after the loss of HepIII) due to the waaQmutation. To resolve which heptose residue was lacking, its phosphoryl substituent, the 31P NMR spectrum of the CWG297 core OS, was compared with the spectra from F470 and CWG312 (waaY). Given the similar P to PPEtN ratios for CWG297 and CWG312 (comparepanels F and G in Fig. 3), it was concluded that the same phosphoryl substituent (P on HepII) was absent in both strains. If the waaQ mutation had affected phosphoryl substitution of HepI, the ratio of P relative to PPEtN would have increased rather than decreased. The observed loss of P from HepII in CWG297 did not contradict the assignment of WaaQ as the HepIII transferase since WaaY had already been assigned as the enzyme responsible for the phosphorylation of HepII (see above). Rather, the transfer of HepIII by WaaQ seems to be a prerequisite to the phosphorylation of HepII catalyzed by WaaY. In E. coli K-12, R1, R2, and R4 and in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, waaP occurs as the third gene of the central operon of the core OS biosynthesis region (Fig. 2 B). Pairwise nucleotide alignments indicated that the waaP gene from these core types was highly conserved (71.8–98.1% identity). Similarity at the protein level was even higher, with multiple sequence alignment of the predicted WaaP proteins showing a total similarity of 93.3% and an identity of 75.9%. In BLASTP searches of the available data bases, WaaP showed no significant similarity to other characterized proteins, as previously reported (9Schnaitman C.A. Klena J.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 655-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Parker C.T. Kloser A.W. Schnaitman C.A. Stein M.A. Gottesman S. Gibson B.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2525-2538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the recently developed PSI-BLAST server analysis program again identified biologically relevant similarities shared between the various WaaP proteins and a large number of kinases (data not shown). Strain CWG296 was derived by insertion of the aacC1 gene into the unique NruI site in the waaP coding region of F470 (Fig. 2 B). The resulting mutant was hypersensitive to novobiocin and SDS (Table II), as expected based on results from previous studies (7Helander I.M. Vaara M. Sukupolvi S. Rhen M. Saarela S. Zähringer U. Mäkelä P.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 33Parker C.T. Pradel E. Schnaitman C.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 930-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Introduction of multicopywaaP (on plasmid pWQ909) into CWG296 restored wild-type levels of resistance to these hydrophobic agents (Table II). Sugar composition analysis detected the presence of all the core OS sugars found in F470 (data not shown). The structure of the CWG296 core OS shown in Table I was deduced from methylation linkage analysis and 31P NMR spectroscopy as follows. First,31P NMR spectroscopy showed a complete lack of phosphorus in the CWG296 core OS (Fig. 3 H), indicating that mutation of waaP resulted in the loss of all phosphoryl substituents from HepI and HepII. The GLC chromatograms from the CWG296 and F470 methylation linkage analyses were then compared to determine any other effects of the waaP mutation on the core OS structure. Of note, the terminal heptose derivative from HepIII was almost completely absent in the CWG296 core OS (note the absence of peak 6 in Fig. 3 D). This lack of terminal heptose was also observed by FAB-MS (data not shown) and implicated the waaP mutation in the loss of HepIII in addition to the above-mentioned deficiency in phosphoryl substituents. The absence of phosphoryl substituents and of HepIII was further corroborated by the appearance of a large peak in the CWG296 GLC chromatogram (peak 8, Fig. 3 D) corresponding to a 3-substituted heptose derivative from HepI and HepII. The calculated molar ratio of this derivative (Table I) was somewhat lower than expected, but the observed signal was clearly twice that from CWG297 (compare peak 8 in Fig. 3, C and D; see also Table I), as expected based on their predicted structures (the prolonged retention time of the 3-substituted heptose derivative on the GLC column may account for this slight discrepancy in molar ratios). Finally, the amounts of terminal glucose (from the β-Glc side branch) and of 2,3-disubstituted glucose (from GlcII) were noticeably decreased in CWG296 (compare peaks 1 and 7 in Fig. 3, A and D; see also Table I). The decrease in 2,3-disubstituted glucose was offset by the appearance of an approximately equal amount of 2-substituted glucose (note the appearance of peak 3, Fig. 3 D), reflecting GlcII lacking the β-Glc substitution. In summary, the mutation of waaP resulted in a core OS, which was devoid of all phosphoryl substituents and the branch HepIII residue and which seemed to contain a lower percentage of β-Glc substituted GlcII. As WaaY and WaaQ had already been assigned in this study as the enzymes responsible for the phosphorylation of HepII and the transfer of HepIII, respectively (see above), and because WaaV had been previously assigned as the β-Glc transferase (see Fig. 2 A),2 it was concluded that the enzyme encoded by waaP was responsible for the phosphoryl substitution of HepI. This conclusion is supported by the sequence similarity of WaaP to known kinases, first reported in this study. The loss of other substituents and sugar residues from the CWG296 core OS does not contradict this assignment but suggests that the activity of WaaP is a prerequisite to the efficient functioning of other enzymes. The data presented here identify WaaY as the enzyme that phosphorylates HepII, WaaQ as the transferase for the branch HepIII residue and WaaP as the enzyme responsible for the addition of either P or PPEtN to HepI. With these assignments, a function has now been ascribed to every gene in the waaQ operon of the core OS biosynthesis region in the E. coli R1 prototype strain, F470 (see Fig. 2 A). Moreover, the deduced structures of the core OS from the waaY, waaQ, and waaPmutants are consistent with a sequence of events in the decoration of the heptose region of the core OS where 1) WaaP adds a phosphoryl substituent to HepI, 2) WaaQ adds HepIII to HepII, and 3) WaaY adds P to HepII. The conclusion that the activity of WaaP is a prerequisite to the functioning of both WaaQ and WaaY is based on the fact that the core OS of CWG296 (waaP) does not have HepIII or a P substituent on HepII (Table I), even though functional copies of the waaQand waaY genes are present on the chromosome. Likewise, the activity of WaaQ is concluded to be required prior to the functioning of WaaY because the core OS of CWG297 (waaQ) does not have the P substituent on HepII (Table I), even though the waaYgene in this mutant is fully functional. These results can be explained by a fastidious substrate requirement in each sequential reaction, such that WaaQ can only effect the transfer of HepIII to a lipid A-core acceptor with P or PPEtN on HepI, and WaaY can only phosphorylate HepII if the lipid A-core acceptor has both HepIII and a phosphoryl substituent on HepI. Alternatively, these data could reflect a requirement for specific protein-protein interactions to provide a functional multi-enzyme complex. Re-evaluation of previous structural studies in E. coli K-12 (13Parker C.T. Kloser A.W. Schnaitman C.A. Stein M.A. Gottesman S. Gibson B.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2525-2538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), in light of the data presented here, further confirms the assignment of WaaY and WaaP function. Parker et al. (13Parker C.T. Kloser A.W. Schnaitman C.A. Stein M.A. Gottesman S. Gibson B.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2525-2538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) created a polar mutation in E. coli K-12 that eliminated function of all genes downstream of waaQ in thewaaQ operon and then determined the core OS structures (by tandem mass spectrometry) of the resulting mutant and of the mutant complemented with both waaG and waaP. As expected, the strain without a functional copy of the waaPgene had no phosphoryl substituents or branch HepIII residue in the heptose region. Complementation of the mutant with waaG and waaP, however, resulted in a core OS with both HepIII and P or PPEtN on HepI, but no P on HepII, again as expected given the absence of a functional waaY gene on the chromosome (due to the polarity of the mutation). Correct and complete interpretation of these results was not possible prior to the unequivocal gene assignments reported here. The data presented here also provide an explanation for the multiple functions attributed to waaP in the literature. For example, the suggested involvement of WaaP in the transfer of HepIII in E. coli K-12 (13Parker C.T. Kloser A.W. Schnaitman C.A. Stein M.A. Gottesman S. Gibson B.W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2525-2538Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) has now been resolved. WaaQ is the HepIII transferase but requires the prior functioning of WaaP. It had previously been suggested, based solely on limited predicted protein sequence similarities, that the product of waaQ might encode the HepIII transferase (9Schnaitman C.A. Klena J.D. Microbiol. Rev. 1993; 57: 655-682Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This study provides the first genetic and structural data to support this claim. Another reported effect of waaP mutations in S. enterica serovars Minnesota (12Mühlradt P. Risse H.J. Lüderitz O. Westphal O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1968; 4: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and Typhimurium (7Helander I.M. Vaara M. Sukupolvi S. Rhen M. Saarela S. Zähringer U. Mäkelä P.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 185: 541-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) is a truncation of the core OS distal to GlcI (Fig. 1); however, the precisely defined, non-polar waaPmutations derived in this study clearly show that core extension is complete, although there is a reduction in the efficiency of branch β-Glc substitution. The core truncation observed in thewaaP mutants of S. enterica could be explained by polar or multiple mutations, which eliminate the function of downstream genes. The contribution of the heptose region phosphoryl substituents to outer membrane stability is clearly shown by novobiocin and SDS sensitivity testing, as illustrated in Table II. The lack of P on HepII in CWG312 (waaY) and in CWG297 (waaQ) resulted in a minor increase in the sensitivity of these strains to the hydrophobic agents. However, the complete lack of phosphoryl substituents in the core OS of CWG296 (waaP) resulted in a 32-fold increase in the susceptibility to novobiocin and more than a 1000-fold increase in the susceptibility to SDS. Therefore, only the complete loss of phosphoryl substituents from the heptose region of the core was sufficient to cause the characteristic hypersensitivity to hydrophobic agents associated with the deep-rough phenotype. It is noteworthy that the negative charges required for LPS cross-linking need not come from phosphoryl substituents; for example, the core OS of Klebsiella pneumoniae is devoid of phosphate but contains negatively charged galacturonic acid residues instead (34Süsskind M. Müller-Loennies S. Nimmich W. Brade H. Holst O. Carbohydr. Res. 1995; 269: C1-C7Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 35Severn W.B. Kelly R.F. Richards J.C. Whitfield C. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1731-1741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Another important question that remains unanswered is how the heterogeneity of phosphoryl substituents on HepI arises. Does WaaP catalyze the transfer of P or PPEtN to HepI? If WaaP is a typical kinase enzyme and catalyzes only the transfer of P, then another enzyme must exist (outside of the waa locus), which adds 2-aminoethyl phosphate (PEtN) to P on HepI to give PPEtN. However, if WaaP catalyzes the transfer of PPEtN, then a subsequent processing reaction must be invoked to explain the loss of PEtN from PPEtN to give P on HepI. There is preliminary evidence which indicates that phosphatidylethanolamine is the direct donor of the PEtN residues found in the core OS (17Hasin M. Kennedy E.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 12475-12477Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together with the similarity of WaaP to known kinases, this evidence suggests that WaaP likely transfers P to HepI with PPEtN arising from subsequent addition of PEtN. With the assignment of function to the waaQ, waaP, and waaY genes, these issues can now be addressed. We gratefully acknowledge the technical assistance provided by Frank St. Michael."

In recent years, the importance of ceramide as a second messenger has been recognized. It has become clear that the signal of some cytokines is mediated by changes in the intracellular concentration of this lipid (1Heller R.A. Kronke M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 2Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For example, local changes in ceramide concentration in specific regions of the plasma membrane are crucial for the transduction of the signal exerted by tumor necrosis factor-α . Upon binding of the cytokine to its receptor, a sphingomyelinase catalyzes the conversion of sphingomyelin into phosphorylcholine and ceramide. The ceramide that is generated in this manner propagates the signal by activating specific protein kinases and phosphatases, resulting in the cellular response. This mechanism has been substantiated by the demonstration that the effects of tumor necrosis factor-α can be experimentally mimicked by the administration of a permeable ceramide with a truncated fatty acyl moiety or, alternatively, by the generation of ceramide at the cell surface by treatment of cells with a bacterial sphingomyelinase (see, for example, Ref. 2Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the plasma membrane of cells, considerable amounts of ceramide are present as a building block in sphingomyelin and also in glycosphingolipids such as glucosylceramide. The latter lipids are not believed to play a role in ceramide-mediated signal transduction since their catabolism is thought to occur exclusively in lysosomes. The importance of intralysosomal glycosphingolipid catabolism is illustrated by the existence of inherited lysosomal storage disorders in which specific glycosphingolipids accumulate as the consequence of an inherited defect in some lysosomal glycosidases. One of the most common lipidoses is Gaucher's disease, a disorder caused by a deficiency in the lysosomal acid β-glucosidase, glucocerebrosidase 1Although the terms glucosylceramidase and glucocerebrosidase can, in principle, both be used for an enzyme that hydrolyzes glucosylceramide (=glucocerebroside), we use the common term glucocerebrosidase to indicate the CBE-inhibitable lysosomal enzyme that is deficient in Gaucher's patients, and glucosylceramidase for the CBE-insensitive non-lysosomal enzyme that is not deficient in Gaucher's patients. (EC3.2.1.45), which hydrolyzes glucosylceramide into free glucose and ceramide (3Beutler E. Grabowski G.A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2641-2670Google Scholar). We discovered the existence of a non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase activity that is located near the cell surface (4van Weely S. Brandsma M. Strijland A. Tager J.M. Aerts J.M.F.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1181: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Besides its distinct subcellular localization, the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase differs clearly in other aspects from the lysosomal glucocerebrosidase (4van Weely S. Brandsma M. Strijland A. Tager J.M. Aerts J.M.F.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1181: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In contrast to the latter enzyme, it is an integral membrane protein that is not deficient in Gaucher's disease patients. The two enzymes are also clearly distinct in their specificity toward artificial substrates, inhibitors, and activators (4van Weely S. Brandsma M. Strijland A. Tager J.M. Aerts J.M.F.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1181: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For example, the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase is not able to hydrolyze artificial β-xylosidic substrates, contrary to glucocerebrosidase. Glucocerebrosidase is irreversibly inhibitable by conduritol B epoxide, in contrast to the glucosylceramidase, which is relatively insensitive to this compound. The lysosomal activator protein saposin C potently stimulates glucocerebrosidase in its enzyme activity, but is without effect on the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase (4van Weely S. Brandsma M. Strijland A. Tager J.M. Aerts J.M.F.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1181: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Earlier experiments with membrane suspensions have revealed that the ceramide that is formed by the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase is efficiently converted into sphingomyelin, presumably by transfer of the phosphorylcholine moiety from phosphatidylcholine (4van Weely S. Brandsma M. Strijland A. Tager J.M. Aerts J.M.F.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1181: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The activity of the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase might therefore result in (transient) changes in glucosylceramide, ceramide, phosphorylcholine, diacylglycerol, and sphingomyelin concentrations. Because of its localization close to the cell surface, a direct or indirect role for the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase in the sphingolipid metabolism linked to ceramide-mediated signaling processes might be envisioned. To investigate this intriguing possibility, we have now developed novel specific inhibitors for the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase. For this purpose, the available information on the membrane-bound feature of the enzyme and its relatively high affinity for inhibition by deoxynojirimycin-type compounds has been exploited. Here we report on the design, synthesis, and application of hydrophobic deoxynojirimycin analogues as specific inhibitors for the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase. The value of these inhibitors as research tools in the elucidation of the physiological relevance of the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase is discussed. All reagents used for synthesis of the deoxynojirimycin derivatives were from Aldrich, except tetra-O-benzylglucopyranose, which was obtained from Sigma. Deoxynojirimycin (DNM)2 was prepared from tetra-O-benzylglucopyranose according to the literature procedure (5Overkleeft H.S. Van Wiltenburg J. Pandit U.K. Tetrahedron Lett. 1994; 50: 4215-4224Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). N-Propyl-, N-butyl-,N-pentyl-, and N-heptyl-DNM were prepared by literature procedure (6Platt F.M. Neises G.R.

Hoppe-Seyler. 1985; 366: 1113-1122Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) by treatment of DNM HCl with the appropriate aldehyde under the agency of sodium cyanoborohydride and acetic acid. N-Pentanoyl-DNM was prepared by condensation of the known 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzyl-DNM (5Overkleeft H.S. Van Wiltenburg J. Pandit U.K. Tetrahedron Lett. 1994; 50: 4215-4224Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar) with valeryl chloride and subsequent hydrogenolysis of the benzyl ethers catalyzed by palladium on carbon. The N-acylated DNM derivatives containing adamantanemethyl, adamantanyl, phenantryl, cholesteryl, and β-cholestanyl substituents were prepared as follows. Glutaric anhydride was treated with 4-nitrophenol to afford pentanedioic acid mono-(4-nitrophenyl) ester. Treatment with oxalyl chloride under the agency of a catalytic amount of dimethylformamide afforded the corresponding 4-chlorocarbonylbutyric acid 4-nitrophenyl ester, which was subsequently condensed with adamantanemethanol, adamantanol, phenantrol, cholesterol, or β-cholestanol to afford 4-adamantanemethylcarbonylbutyric acid 4-nitrophenyl ester, 4-adamantanecarbonylbutyric acid 4-nitrophenyl ester, 4-phenantrylcarbonylbutyric acid 4-nitrophenyl ester, 4-cholesterylcarbonylbutyric acid 4-nitrophenyl ester, and 4β-cholestanylmethylcarbonylbutyric acid 4-nitrophenyl ester. Condensation of these esters with 2,3,4,6-tetra-O-benzyl-DNM and subsequent palladium/carbon-mediated hydrogenolysis affordedN-(4-adamantanemethanylcarboxy-1-oxo)-DNM,N-(4-adamantanylcarboxy-1-oxo)-DNM,N-(4-phenantrylcarboxy-1-oxo)-DNM,N-(4-cholesterylcarboxy-1-oxo)-DNM, and N-(4-β-cholestanylcarboxy-1-oxo)-DNM, respectively. Alternatively, the N-alkylated DNM derivatives containing adamantanemethyl and cholesteryl substituents were prepared by reduction of the known glutaric dialdehyde mono(diethyl)acetal to 5,5-diethoxypentan-1-ol (9Wanner M.J. Koomen G. J. Org. Chem. 1995; 60: 5634-5637Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar), which was transformed to the corresponding methanesulfonic acid 5,5-diethoxypentyl ester by treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride and triethylamine. Condensation with adamantanemethanol and cholesterol, respectively, under the agency of sodium hydride and subsequent liberation of the aldehyde functionality afforded 5-(adamantan-1-yl-methoxy)pentanal and 5-(cholesteroloxy)pentanal, which were condensed with DNM under reductive amination conditions (sodium cyanoborohydride and acetic acid) to afford N-(5-adamantane-1-yl-methoxy)pentyl)-DNM (AMP-DNM) and N-(5-cholesteroxypentyl)-DNM (CP-DNM). The structures of these compounds are shown in Fig. 1. Water extracts of Gaucher's disease and normal spleens were prepared by homogenization of 10 g of tissue in 30 ml of water (4 °C) using an Ultra-Turrax and centrifugation for 20 min at 15,000 × g. The membrane suspensions were prepared by resuspending the pellet in 30 ml of 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 5.8) and centrifugation (15 min, 15,000 ×g). This procedure was repeated two times. All 4-methylumbelliferyl (4-MU) substrates used were obtained from Sigma. The activity of Ceredase® (Genzyme, Boston, MA) was determined with 3 mm 4-MU β-glucoside in the presence of 0.25% (w/v) sodium taurocholate and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in McIlvaine buffer (0.1 m citrate and 0.2m phosphate buffer) (pH 5.2). The activity of the lysosomal glucocerebrosidase in splenic membrane suspensions was determined with 3 mm 4-MU β-glucoside in McIlvaine buffer (pH 5.2). The activity of the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase in membrane suspensions was determined with 3 mm 4-MU β-glucoside in McIlvaine buffer (pH 5.8) upon preincubation for 30 min at room temperature with 2.5 mm conduritol B epoxide (CBE) (Sigma). The activity of the lysosomal α-glucosidase was measured with 0.3 mm 4-MU α-glucoside in 125 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.0). IC50 values were determined by variation of inhibitor concentrations. Assays were incubated at 37 °C and stopped by the addition of glycine/NaOH (pH 10.6). The amount of liberated 4-MU was determined with a Perkin-Elmer LS2 fluorometer. Human melanoma cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Flow Laboratories) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (Hyclone Laboratories). The enzyme activities were measured as described previously (4van Weely S. Brandsma M. Strijland A. Tager J.M. Aerts J.M.F.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1181: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In short, melanoma cells were incubated with 5 mm 4-MU β-glucoside in phosphate-buffered saline in the absence or presence of various DNM inhibitors. To distinguish between the contributions by both the lysosomal and non-lysosomal enzymes, the experiments were performed in parallel with melanoma cells that had been preincubated with and without CBE (2 h, 0.5 mm). The CBE-sensitive activity can be ascribed to the lysosomal glucocerebrosidase, and the CBE-insensitive activity to the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase. After several time intervals, media samples were taken, and the fluorescence of the liberated 4-MU was measured. Human macrophages were obtained as described earlier (10Hollak C.E.M. van Weely S. van Oers M.H.J. Aerts J.M.F.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1288-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). The deoxynojirimycin derivatives, dissolved in Me2SO, were added to cultured macrophages at various concentrations by dilution in culture medium. It was checked that the minor amounts of Me2SO introduced in this manner were without effect. After 4 days of preincubation with the inhibitors,in situ enzyme activities were measured using fluorescent lipid substrates. For glucosylceramidase and glucocerebrosidase activity measurement, C6-NBD-glucosylceramide was used as substrate, and glucosylceramide synthase activity was determined with C6-NBD-ceramide as substrate. The lipid substrates were complexed to fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin at a 1:1 molar ratio (11van Weely S. van Leeuwen M.B. Jansen I.D.C. de Bruijn M.A.C. Brouwer-Kelder E. Schram A.W. Sa Miranda M.C. Barranger J.A. Petersen E.M. Goldblatt J. Stotz H. Schwarzmann G. Sandhoff K. Svennerholm L. Erikson A. Tager J.M. Aerts J.M.F.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1096: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The cells were preincubated for 2 h with or without 300 μm CBE, washed, and incubated for 1 h with 3 ml of medium with or without 300 μm CBE and 5 nmol of the substrate-bovine serum albumin complex. The cells were harvested, lipids were extracted, and the C6-NBD lipids were separated by thin-layer chromatography (11van Weely S. van Leeuwen M.B. Jansen I.D.C. de Bruijn M.A.C. Brouwer-Kelder E. Schram A.W. Sa Miranda M.C. Barranger J.A. Petersen E.M. Goldblatt J. Stotz H. Schwarzmann G. Sandhoff K. Svennerholm L. Erikson A. Tager J.M. Aerts J.M.F.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1096: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The lipids were quantified with a luminescence spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer LS50). Enzyme activities were related to those in the absence of the inhibitor. C6-NBD-glucosylceramide was synthesized as described (12Stotz H. NBD-Sphingolipide, Synthese, Metabolismus und intrazellulärer Transport.Ph.D. thesis. University of Bonn, 1990Google Scholar). Briefly, glucosylsphingosine (2.17 μmol) and C6-NBD-hexanoic acid succinimidylic ester (4.33 μmol) (both from Sigma) were dissolved in 530 μl of dimethylformamide. Upon addition of 20 μl of diisopropylethylamine, the mixture was stirred at 30 °C for several hours. Synthesis was checked by analysis on a thin-layer plate (developing system of chloroform/methanol/water (65:25:4 by volume)) using ultraviolet illumination and iodine. The reaction mixture was diluted with methanol, evaporated under nitrogen, and analyzed on several thin-layer plates. The separated C6-NBD-glucosylceramide was scraped off and extracted with chloroform/methanol (1:1 by volume), chloroform/methanol (2:1 by volume), and methanol. The supernatants were collected, evaporated, and applied to Lichroprep RP-18 columns as described (11van Weely S. van Leeuwen M.B. Jansen I.D.C. de Bruijn M.A.C. Brouwer-Kelder E. Schram A.W. Sa Miranda M.C. Barranger J.A. Petersen E.M. Goldblatt J. Stotz H. Schwarzmann G. Sandhoff K. Svennerholm L. Erikson A. Tager J.M. Aerts J.M.F.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1096: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). C6-NBD-glucosylceramide was eluted with methanol and chloroform/methanol (1:1 by volume), evaporated to dryness, and dissolved in ethanol. The concentration was determined spectrophotometrically (485 nm, ε = 20,000 units/mol/liter) and fluorometrically (excitation at 480 nm and emission at 530 nm). Melanoma cells were cultured as described above, and a crude microsome fraction was prepared from a post-nuclear supernatant exactly as described earlier (13Tulp A. Verwoerd D. Pieters J. Electrophoresis. 1993; 14: 1295-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In a previous study (4van Weely S. Brandsma M. Strijland A. Tager J.M. Aerts J.M.F.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1181: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), a number of known glucosidase inhibitors (d-gluconolactone, castanospermine, deoxynojirimycin, and N-butyldeoxynojirimycin) were tested with respect to their capacity to inhibit the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase. Although deoxynojirimycin was found to be a potent inhibitor, its value was limited because, even at low concentrations, it inhibited not only the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase, but also the lysosomal glucocerebrosidase (4van Weely S. Brandsma M. Strijland A. Tager J.M. Aerts J.M.F.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1181: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Previous research has also revealed that the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase is tightly integrated in the membrane and hydrolyzes its substrate glucosylceramide while it is also inserted in the membrane (4van Weely S. Brandsma M. Strijland A. Tager J.M. Aerts J.M.F.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1181: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). These findings prompted us to develop novel, more specific inhibitors for the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase, assuming that the desired inhibitor should contain a deoxynojirimycin moiety, anN-alkyl spacer, and a large hydrophobic group, promoting correct insertion in the membrane. To test this concept, a series of deoxynojirimycin derivatives was synthesized as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig. 1). The inhibitory capacity and specificity of the deoxynojirimycin-based compounds were examined by analysis of their effects on the activity of purified human lysosomal glucocerebrosidase (Ceredase) and α-glucosidase and on the activity of the lysosomal glucocerebrosidase and the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase as present in a membrane suspension prepared from human spleen. Under “Experimental Procedures,” the sources of the enzyme preparations and the activity measurements are described. Table I gives an overview of the apparent IC50 values of the various enzymes for the deoxynojirimycin derivatives. It can be seen that inhibition of the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase by the N-alkyl derivatives of deoxynojirimycin increased with increasing chain length. Furthermore, it was found that the presence of a carbonyl moiety (i.e. anN-acyl spacer) in the spacer negatively influenced the inhibitory capacity.Table IApparent IC50 values of various glycosidasesInhibitorIC50 values for inhibition of:Non-lysosomal glucosylceramidaseGlucocerebrosidaseα-GlucosidaseCeredaseMembranesDNM28.805061411.46Propyl-DNM0.1235463329.24Butyl-DNM0.319124246.43Pentyl-DNM0.0382498.53.74Heptyl-DNM0.028913.51.25Pentanoyl-DNM84670832.39AMC-DNM46119.73.2NIAC-DNM3061134.1NIPC-DNM3911.60.44NICC-DNMNI51.6NINIBC-DNMNI11.2NINIAMP-DNM0.00170.160.0480.87CP-DNM0.0970.960.777.20K m3.283.251.451.88IC50 values (i.e. inhibitor concentration resulting in 50% inhibition) were determined by variation of inhibitor concentrations.

Addition of a large hydrophobic group such as adamantane (AMP-DNM) or cholesterol (CP-DNM) to an N-pentyl spacer dramatically increased the capacity to inhibit the glucosylceramidase activity. The apparent IC50 values for AMP-DNM and CP-DNM are extremely low: 2 nm and 0.1 μm, respectively. For a comparison, the IC50 values for DNM and butyl-DNM are 30 and 0.3 μm, respectively. Table I shows that the lysosomal glucocerebrosidase is, in general, less sensitive to inhibition by deoxynojirimycin derivatives than the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase. Pure glucocerebrosidase in solution and the same enzyme associated with splenic membranes show a different sensitivity to the inhibitors. Apparently, the kinetic properties of glucocerebrosidase in these two different states differ, as is also suggested by the clear difference in apparent K m for 4-MU β-glucoside. Both the purified soluble and the membrane-associated lysosomal glucocerebrosidases are most potently inhibited by deoxynojirimycin analogues with an N-pentyl spacer with a coupled large hydrophobic group (Table I). With respect to the lysosomal α-glucosidase, it was found that variation of the bulky substituent in the N-alkyl series, in general, exerted relatively little effect. However, the compoundsN-(4-adamantanemethanylcarboxy-1-oxo)-DNM,N-(4-adamantanylcarboxy-1-oxo)-DNM,N-(4-phenantrylcarboxy-1-oxo)-DNM,N-(4-cholesterylcarboxy-1-oxo)-DNM, and N-(4β-cholestanylcarboxy-1-oxo)-DNM were very poor inhibitors (Table I). The capacity of deoxynojirimycin analogues to inhibit the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase and glucocerebrosidase activities in cultured melanoma cells was investigated. For this purpose, cells were incubated with 4-MU β-glucoside, and its hydrolysis by the two enzymes was determined. To distinguish between the contributions by both enzymes, the experiments were performed in parallel with melanoma cells that had been preincubated either with or without CBE. The CBE-sensitive activity can be ascribed to the lysosomal glucocerebrosidase, and the insensitive activity to the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase. Table II shows that again the most potent inhibitors were found to be AMP-DNM and CP-DNM. The non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase was very sensitive to inhibition, even more pronounced than in cell homogenates. For intact cells, the apparent IC50 values of AMP-DNM and CP-DNM were ∼0.3 and 50 nm, respectively. At these concentrations, no significant inhibition of the lysosomal glucocerebrosidase activity was detectable (Table II).Table IIIn vivo inhibition by deoxynojirimycin analoguesInhibitorIC50Non-lysosomal glucosylceramidaseGlucoccrebrosidasenmDNM20,000NIPropyl-DNM650NIButyl-DNM200NIPentyl-DNM150NIPentanoyl-DNM30,000NIAMC-DNM200,0005000AC-DNM200,0008000PC-DNM20,000NIAMP-DNM0.3100CP-DNM50800Melanoma cells were incubated with various concentrations of inhibitors to determine their IC50 values.

Next, the effects of AMP-DNM and butyl-DNM were also examined with a more physiological lipid substrate in macrophages, the cells involved in glucosylceramide storage in Gaucher's disease. The activity of the lysosomal glucocerebrosidase and the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase were measured using C6-NBD-glucosylceramide as substrate. After incubation of the cells with the substrate, lipids were extracted and separated by thin-layer chromatography, and the various fluorescently labeled metabolites were fluorometrically quantified. Again, CBE was employed in these experiments to discriminate between the metabolism due to the action of the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase and glucocerebrosidase. The result of one of these experiments is depicted as an example in Fig. 2. It has to be mentioned that no degradation of C6-NBD-ceramide was detected, as observed in earlier studies (4van Weely S. Brandsma M. Strijland A. Tager J.M. Aerts J.M.F.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1181: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Apparently, C6-NBD-ceramide is a poor substrate for the lysosomal ceramidase, or it leaves the lysosomes prior to degradation. The inhibition of the activities of the lysosomal glucocerebrosidase and the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase by the tested deoxynojirimycin analogues in macrophages was comparable to that in melanoma cells (Table III). Incubation of macrophages with 0.05–1 nm AMP-DNM led to marked inhibition of the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase activity, whereas the lysosomal glucocerebrosidase activity was not decreased under these conditions. In fact, we repeatedly noted a slight increase in the activity of the lysosomal glucocerebrosidase in cells treated with the inhibitor. Most likely, this is due to the fact that, upon inhibition of the non-lysosomal enzyme, more substrate reached the enzyme in the lysosomal compartment. Up-regulation of the lysosomal glucocerebrosidase in cells pretreated with inhibitor seems unlikely since enzyme activity was found to be increased only in intact macrophages and not in homogenates of the same cells.Table IIIEffect of DNM analogues on cultured macrophagesInhibitorGlucosylceramidase activityGlucocerebrosidase activity%%None100100Butyl-DNM 0.5 μm51120 5 μm12112 50 μM8120AMP-DNM 0.0025 nM90120 0.05 nM65115 1 nM40130Human macrophages, obtained and cultured as described (10Hollak C.E.M. van Weely S. van Oers M.H.J.

After 4 days of preincubation with inhibitor, glucosylceramidase and glucocerebrosidase activities were determined with C6-NBD-glucosylceramide as substrate (4van Weely S. Brandsma M. Strijland A. Tager J.M. Aerts J.M.F.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1181: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Enzyme activities are related to those in the absence of inhibitor (100%).

Invest. 1994; 93: 1288-1292Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar), were incubated with different concentrations of butyl-DNM or AMP-DNM. After 4 days of preincubation with inhibitor, glucosylceramidase and glucocerebrosidase activities were determined with C6-NBD-glucosylceramide as substrate (4van Weely S. Brandsma M. Strijland A. Tager J.M. Aerts J.M.F.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1181: 55-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Enzyme activities are related to those in the absence of inhibitor (100%). Because of the extreme sensitivity of the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase to AMP-DNM, we investigated whether the inhibition by this compound is fully reversible. To test this, macrophages were either treated with AMP-DNM for 1 h and subsequently washed extensively and cultured for 9 days in the absence of the inhibitor or long-term treated with the inhibitor. Next, the activity of the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase was determined with C6-NBD-glucosylceramide as substrate. It was observed that the 1-h treatment with inhibitor led to a complete inhibition of the glucosylceramidase activity for at least 9 days, suggesting that the inhibitor is not easily removed from the enzyme or its surrounding membrane (Fig. 2). The easy access of hydrophobic AMP-DNM to the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase in intact cells made us to look more closely into the localization of the enzyme using a recently developed subcellular fractionation technique that is a combination of density gradient centrifugation and free-flow electrophoresis (13Tulp A. Verwoerd D. Pieters J. Electrophoresis. 1993; 14: 1295-1301Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 14Tulp A. Verwoerd D. Dobberstein B. Ploegh H.L. Pieters J. Nature. 1994; 369: 120-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 3, the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase was recovered in fractions 30–42 of the gradient, which are known to contain light endosomal structures. The apparent localization of the enzyme in compartments close to the cell surface might explain its relatively high sensitivity to inhibition by AMP-DNM in intact cells as compared with cell homogenates. Presumably, in homogenates, a much larger proportion of the lipophilic inhibitors is scavenged by membrane fragments that do not contain the enzyme compared with incubation of intact cells with the compounds. We studied to what extent other reactions were also inhibited upon incubation of intact cells with AMP-DNM. Glucosylceramide synthase is a glucosyltransferase that catalyzes the synthesis of glucosylceramide from ceramide and UDP-glucose. The enzyme has been reported to be particularly sensitive to inhibition by butyl-DNM (6Platt F.M. Neises G.R. Dwek R.A. Butters T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8362-8365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Glucosylceramide synthase activity was measured by incubation of intact cells with C6-NBD-ceramide and analysis of C6-NBD-glucosylceramide formation. In this manner, it was found that, in agreement with the previous report (6Platt F.M. Neises G.R. Dwek R.A. Butters T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8362-8365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the IC50 value of butyl-DNM is ∼25 μm and, furthermore, that the IC50 of AMP-DNM is 25 nm. In addition, it was observed that incubation of melanoma cells and macrophages with 1 nm AMP-DNM did not result in a significant reduction of glucosylceramide synthase activity, whereas concomitantly, the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase was almost completely inhibited. The trimming α-glucosidases in the endoplasmic reticulum are also known to be sensitive to hydrophobic deoxynojirimycin analogues. The effect of AMP-DNM in this respect was examined by studying the folding of influenza hemagglutinin in the endoplasmic reticulum, as described (15Braakman I. Hoover-Litty H. Wagner K.R. Helenius A. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 401-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). No inhibitory effect of AMP-DNM at 1 nm on oligosaccharide chain modification that resulted in delayed folding of influenza hemagglutinin (16Hammond C. Braakman I. Helenius A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 913-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar) was detectable (data not shown). Only at concentrations above 0.2 mm AMP-DNM was clear inhibition of this process detected. Our investigation has led to the generation of potent inhibitors of the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase. In particular, AMP-DNM is an attractive compound in this respect. A complete inhibition of non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase activity occurs upon incubation of intact cells with extremely low concentrations of the DNM derivative. The localization of the enzyme close to the cell surface, the design of the compound, and its tendency to associate with membranes probably all contribute to this. At low nanomolar concentrations, AMP-DNM seems not to significantly affect other enzyme systems that are sensitive to hydrophobic deoxynojirimycin analogues, such as the glucosylceramide synthase and oligosaccharide chain-trimming glucosidases. The compound should therefore be useful for investigations on the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase. It will be of particular interest to study the extent to which the enzyme activity is relevant for the lipid metabolism coupled to signal transduction processes. Hypothetically, the enzyme could indirectly affect the activity of neutral sphingomyelinase by changing the concentration of ceramide. Alternatively, the enzyme itself might be involved in the conversion of some extracellular signal into increased ceramide concentrations and corresponding signaling. Our attempts to purify the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase by conventional purification procedures have been unsuccessful so far. A major complication is caused by the instability of the enzyme upon solubilization with detergents. On the basis of the findings made in this study, it seems attractive to exploit the interaction of hydrophobic deoxynojirimycin analogues with the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase for affinity purification of the enzyme. Previously, the lysosomal glucocerebrosidase and the endoplasmic reticulum α-glucosidase have been purified onN-alkyldeoxynojirimycin derivatives immobilized on a column matrix (17Osiecki-Newman K.M. Fabbro D. Dinur T. Boas S. Gatt S. Legler G. Desnick R.J. Grabowski G.A. Enzyme (Basel). 1986; 35: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 18Hettkamp H. Legler G. Bause E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 142: 85-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The feasibility of a comparable approach for the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase is currently being studied. Another important application for the inhibitors may be found in the field of Gaucher's disease. In this disorder, tissue macrophages store glucosylceramide due to the inherited deficiency in lysosomal glucocerebrosidase activity (3Beutler E. Grabowski G.A. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York1995: 2641-2670Google Scholar). The abnormal lipid-laden macrophages, called Gaucher's cells, are thought to be an essential factor in the pathophysiology of the disease. 3J. M. F. G. Aerts, R. G. Boot, G. H. Renkema, M. Verhoek, S. van Weely, C. E. M. Hollak, M. H. J. van Oers, A. Erikson, and H. Michelakakis, submitted for publication. These cells most likely secrete cytokines and hydrolases that promote tissue turnover and propagate the formation of novel storage macrophages. The mechanism by which impaired lysosomal glucosylceramide degradation leads to activation of the storage cells is unknown. It is conceivable that the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase plays an important role in the process. Elevated concentrations of glucosylceramide in macrophages of glucocerebrosidase-deficient individuals might lead to increased activity of the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase. Thus, ceramide formation could be constitutively increased in membranes close to the cell surface, affecting signal transduction pathways and promoting the characteristic activation state of Gaucher's cells. The newly developed inhibitors should allow studies to be performed on the importance of the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase in this respect. If this enzyme activity indeed proves to be an essential factor in the pathogenesis of Gaucher's disease, one might consider the use of the inhibitors in therapeutic intervention of the disorder. Presently, Gaucher's disease is treated by regular intravenous infusions with large amounts of a modified human glucocerebrosidase (Ceredase) (19Barton N.W. Furbish F.S. Murray G.J. Garfield M. Brady R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1913-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar,20Furbish F.S. Steer C.J. Krett N.L. Barranger J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 673: 425-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). This enzyme supplementation therapy is very successful; however, the application is restricted due to the high costs. Interestingly, the use of butyl-DNM as a therapeutic agent for Gaucher's disease has already been considered for a completely different reason. It has been argued that a marked inhibition of the synthesis of glucosylceramide may be beneficial for Gaucher's disease patients since this would result in a reduction in the amount of glucosylceramide that has to be degraded by macrophages. A number of inhibitors of glucosylceramide synthase have been proposed in connection with this so-called substrate deprivation approach, including 1-phenyldecanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol and its analogue 1-phenyl-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol (21Abe A. Radin N.S. Shayman J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1299: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and, more recently, butyl-DNM (6Platt F.M. Neises G.R. Dwek R.A. Butters T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8362-8365Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Platt F.M. Neises G.R. Reinkensmeier G. Townsend M.J. Perry V.H. Proia R.L. Winchester B. Dwek R.A. Butters T.D. Science. 1997; 276: 428-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar) and the galactose analogue, butyldeoxygalactonojirimycin (23Platt F.M. Neises G.R. Karlsson G.B. Dwek R.A. Butters T.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27108-27114Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results of our investigation indicate that administration of butyl-DNM will inhibit not only glucosylceramide synthase, but also the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase, which is, in fact, much more sensitive to this inhibitor. For deoxygalactonojirimycin and N-butylgalactonojirimycin, for which inhibition of the glucosylceramide synthase was also recently demonstrated, we obtained similar results as for DNM and butyl-DNM in the same concentration range (data not shown), indicating that the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase can also be inhibited by these compounds. It can be envisioned that the combined inhibition by hydrophobic deoxynojirimycin analogues of glucosylceramide synthase and the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase activities in Gaucher's patients might act as a double-edged sword since this could reduce the formation of storage cells and inhibit the deleterious activation of these cells. In conclusion, the newly developed hydrophobic deoxynojirimycin derivatives, in particular AMP-DNM, have proven to be extremely potent inhibitors of the non-lysosomal glucosylceramidase and should be valuable research tools in the elucidation of the physiological role of this enzyme.

In the pancreatic beta cell, for example, they provide the link between changes in blood glucose concentration and insulin secretion. The KATP channel sets the beta cell resting membrane potential, and its closure in response to glucose metabolism elicits membrane depolarization, activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, and a rise in Ca2+ influx that stimulates insulin release (2Ashcroft F.M.

Because long-term exposure to nonesterified fatty acids increases cellular levels of LC acyl-CoA esters in the beta cell (18Larsson O. Deeney J.T. Bränström R. Berggren P-O. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10623-10626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 20Prentki M. Vischer S. Glennon M.C. Regazzi R. Deeney J.T. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5802-5810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this finding may have implications for the regulation of insulin secretion under conditions in which nonesterified fatty acids are increased, as in obese subjects (21Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 22Prentki M. Tornheim K. Corkey B.E. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The elevated intracellular LC acyl-CoA ester concentration would be expected to activate KATP channels, thereby hyperpolarizing the beta cell and inhibiting insulin secretion. It is possible, therefore, that increased KATP channel activity, induced by LC acyl-CoA esters, may contribute to the impaired insulin secretion observed in obese non-insulin-dependent diabetics.The mechanism of beta cell KATP channel activation by oleoyl-CoA differs from that of the classical potassium channel opener diazoxide in several ways. In particular, the effects of oleoyl-CoA do not require Mg2+, nor are they abolished following mild proteolysis of the inner membrane surface (19Bränström R. Corkey B.E. Berggren P-O. Larsson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17390-17394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This suggests that oleoyl-CoA and diazoxide may act by different mechanisms. In this paper, we show that oleoyl-CoA stimulates the activity of the cloned beta cell KATP channel (Kir6.2/SUR1). We further show this effect is mediated by interaction of the acyl-CoA ester with the Kir6.2 subunit of the channel and that it is associated with a reduced sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of ATP and a decreased rate of channel rundown. Activation by oleoyl-CoA is not observed for a related member of the inward rectifier K-channel family (Kir1.1a).DISCUSSIONWe report here that oleoyl-CoA activates the cloned beta cell KATP channel (Kir6.2/SUR1) expressed in Xenopusoocytes. This suggests that the acyl-CoA interacts directly with the KATP channel, or a channel regulator that is expressed endogenously in the Xenopus oocyte, rather than with a beta cell-specific membrane component.Subunit InteractionWe found that oleoyl-CoA activated both Kir6.2/SUR1 channels and Kir6.2ΔC36 channels expressed in the absence of SUR1. This result indicates that the mechanism of acyl-CoA activation does not require the presence of the sulfonylurea receptor subunit and is thus very different from that of other KATPchannel activators, such as MgADP and diazoxide, which mediate their effects via SUR1 (8Nichols C.G.

Our results provide an explanation for the findings of studies on the native beta cell KATP channel which have shown that the response to oleoyl-CoA was both Mg2+-independent and unimpaired by trypsinization of the inner membrane surface (19Bränström R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 17390-17394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), conditions that abolish the potentiatory action of ADP and diazoxide (28Proks P. Ashcroft F.M.

Oleoyl-CoA is the first compound to be shown to mediate a stimulatory effect on KATP channel activity via the Kir6.2 subunit.Although we show that SUR1 is not required for KATP channel activation by oleoyl-CoA, our results do not allow us to conclude that the compound interacts directly with the Kir6.2 subunit itself. It is possible, for example, that oleoyl-CoA interacts with the lipid membrane, or with a third protein endogenously present in bothXenopus oocytes and pancreatic beta cells that influences KATP channel activity. Direct binding of oleoyl-CoA to other proteins has been demonstrated, including those within the metabolic pathway such as the ATP/ADP translocase and the uncoupling protein (33Ruoho A.E. Woldegiorgis G. Kobayshi C. Shrago E. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 4168-4172Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,34Woldegiorgis G. Duff T. Contreras L. Shrago E. Ruoho A.E. Biochem. Biophys.

Nature. 1997; 392: 512-516Crossref Scopus (452) Google Scholar). Binding studies are therefore now required to determine whether oleoyl-CoA directly binds to Kir6.2.Altered ATP SensitivityOur results demonstrate that oleoyl-CoA reduces the sensitivity of Kir6.2/SUR1 and Kir6.2ΔC36 channels to ATP. There are a number of possible explanations for this finding. First, the acyl-CoA might compete with ATP for its binding site. Second, oleoyl-CoA might allosterically affect the conformation, and thereby the affinity, of the ATP-binding site. Third, oleoyl-CoA might indirectly alter the apparent ATP sensitivity by affecting the single-channel kinetics; for example, if the ATP-inhibited state were only accessible when the channel were closed, an increase in the open probability would necessarily decrease the channel ATP sensitivity (36Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Proks P. Trapp S. Ryder T.J. Haug T. Reimann F. Ashcroft F.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3290-3296Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 37Shyng S.L. Ferrigni T. Nichols C.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Because oleoyl-CoA does in fact alter the single-channel kinetics and shifts the gating of the channel toward the open state, the latter possibility may contribute, at least in part, to the reduced ATP-sensitivity.Other K-channels and Lipid EffectorsThe anionic phospholipid PIP2 interacts with native cardiac and beta cell KATP channels to enhance their activity (38Hilgemann D.W. Ball R. Science. 1996; 273: 956-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 39Fan Z. Makielski J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5388-5395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Activation of Kir6.2/SUR1 currents by PIP2 has also been reported (39Fan Z. Makielski J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5388-5395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). However, the properties of PIP2 activation are not identical to those of oleoyl-CoA, because the effect of PIP2 was instantaneous and the compound also activated Kir1.1a (39Fan Z. Makielski J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5388-5395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). This makes it less likely that the two compounds interact with the channel in exactly the same way.In contrast to the native and cloned beta cell KATPchannel, the mitochondrial KATP channel is inhibited by oleoyl-CoA (Ki, 80 nm; Ref. 40Pauceek P. Yarov-Yarovoy V. Sun X. Garlid K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32084-32088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The molecular identity of this channel has not been determined, but our data suggest either that the pore-forming subunit is unlikely to be Kir6.2 or that an additional inhibitory effect of oleoyl-CoA is mediated through a second subunit.Physiological ImplicationsOur results indicate that oleoyl-CoA interacts with the Kir6.2, rather than the SUR1, subunit of the KATP channel. Kir6.2 is expressed in a number of tissues, including heart, skeletal muscle, and certain brain regions (13Inagaki N. Gonoi T. Clement J.P. Namba N. Inazawa J. Gonzalez G. Aguilar-Bryan L. Seino S. Bryan J. Science. 1995; 270: 1166-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (1607) Google Scholar, 15Sakura H. Ämmälä C. Smith P.A. Gribble F.M. Ashcroft F.M.

It is believed to serve as the pore-forming subunit in all these tissues. Our data therefore suggest that long chain acyl-CoA esters may also influence KATP channel function, and thereby electrical activity, in tissues other than the beta cell.The increased activity, and reduced sensitivity of Kir6.2/SUR1 and Kir6.2ΔC36 to ATP, observed in the presence of oleoyl-CoA may have important physiological implications. Long-term exposure to elevated levels of circulating free fatty acids occurs in diabetes and obesity and has also been shown to increase the intracellular levels of long-chain acyl CoA esters (18Larsson O. Deeney J.T. Bränström R. Berggren P-O. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10623-10626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 20Prentki M. Vischer S. Glennon M.C. Regazzi R. Deeney J.T. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5802-5810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our results suggest that this both enhances the activity of the KATP channel and renders it less sensitive to ATP, thereby producing membrane hyperpolarization and decreasing glucose-induced insulin secretion. This might contribute to the reduced sensitivity of the pancreatic beta cell to glucose observed in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. Potassium channels that are inhibited by ATP (KATPchannels)1 are found in many tissues, where they serve to couple the metabolic state of the cell to its electrical activity (1Ashcroft F.M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1988; 11: 97-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (767) Google Scholar). In the pancreatic beta cell, for example, they provide the link between changes in blood glucose concentration and insulin secretion. The KATP channel sets the beta cell resting membrane potential, and its closure in response to glucose metabolism elicits membrane depolarization, activation of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, and a rise in Ca2+ influx that stimulates insulin release (2Ashcroft F.M. Rorsman P. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1989; 54: 87-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar). In cardiac muscle, and in brain neurons, KATP channels may be involved in the response to ischemia, whereas in smooth muscle they are important for the regulation of vascular tone (3Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1991; 261: H1675-H1686PubMed Google Scholar, 4Quayle J.M. Nelson M.T. Standen N.B. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 1165-1232Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). KATP channels are formed by the physical association of four inwardly rectifying K+ channel (Kir6.2) subunits with four sulfonylurea receptor (SUR) subunits (5Clement J.P., IV Kunjilwar K.

Kir6.2 serves as an ATP-sensitive pore that is common to many types of KATPchannels. SUR is a regulatory subunit that modulates the channel gating properties, enhances the apparent ATP-sensitivity, and acts as the target for sulfonylurea drugs, K-channel openers and intracellular Mg-nucleotides, which modulate KATP channel activity (8Nichols C.G.

It is currently believed that Kir6.2/SUR1 forms the beta cell KATP channel, Kir6.2/SUR2A forms the cardiac KATP channel, and Kir6.2/SUR2B forms the smooth muscle KATP channel (13Inagaki N. Gonoi T.

It has recently been shown that long chain (LC) acyl-CoA esters are able to activate native KATP channels in inside-out membrane patches excised from pancreatic beta cells (18Larsson O. Deeney J.T.

The intracellular concentrations of LC acyl-CoA esters are predicted to vary with the metabolic state of the cell. Because long-term exposure to nonesterified fatty acids increases cellular levels of LC acyl-CoA esters in the beta cell (18Larsson O. Deeney J.T. Bränström R. Berggren P-O. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10623-10626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 20Prentki M. Vischer S. Glennon M.C. Regazzi R. Deeney J.T. Corkey B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5802-5810Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this finding may have implications for the regulation of insulin secretion under conditions in which nonesterified fatty acids are increased, as in obese subjects (21Prentki M. Corkey B.E. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 273-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 22Prentki M. Tornheim K. Corkey B.E. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 32-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The elevated intracellular LC acyl-CoA ester concentration would be expected to activate KATP channels, thereby hyperpolarizing the beta cell and inhibiting insulin secretion. It is possible, therefore, that increased KATP channel activity, induced by LC acyl-CoA esters, may contribute to the impaired insulin secretion observed in obese non-insulin-dependent diabetics. The mechanism of beta cell KATP channel activation by oleoyl-CoA differs from that of the classical potassium channel opener diazoxide in several ways. In particular, the effects of oleoyl-CoA do not require Mg2+, nor are they abolished following mild proteolysis of the inner membrane surface (19Bränström R. Corkey B.E. Berggren P-O. Larsson O. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17390-17394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This suggests that oleoyl-CoA and diazoxide may act by different mechanisms. In this paper, we show that oleoyl-CoA stimulates the activity of the cloned beta cell KATP channel (Kir6.2/SUR1). We further show this effect is mediated by interaction of the acyl-CoA ester with the Kir6.2 subunit of the channel and that it is associated with a reduced sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of ATP and a decreased rate of channel rundown. Activation by oleoyl-CoA is not observed for a related member of the inward rectifier K-channel family (Kir1.1a). DISCUSSIONWe report here that oleoyl-CoA activates the cloned beta cell KATP channel (Kir6.2/SUR1) expressed in Xenopusoocytes. This suggests that the acyl-CoA interacts directly with the KATP channel, or a channel regulator that is expressed endogenously in the Xenopus oocyte, rather than with a beta cell-specific membrane component.Subunit InteractionWe found that oleoyl-CoA activated both Kir6.2/SUR1 channels and Kir6.2ΔC36 channels expressed in the absence of SUR1.

A detailed understanding of the mechanisms and regulation of the Ada and Spt protein-containing complexes (Ada·Spt complexes for simplicity) requires the identification of component proteins. We now identify Tra1p as a component of the Ada·Spt complexes. Tra1p is a member of a group of putative protein kinases, including the catalytic subunit of human DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKCS) and ATM, that contain a carboxyl-terminal region related to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3K1; reviewed in Refs.17Zakian V.A.

In addition, Tra1p shows extensive sequence similarity throughout its entire length to the human protein TRRAP that associates with both c-Myc and E2F-1 (21McMahon S.B. Van Buskirk H.A. Dugan K.A.

A 11,832-base pair FspI fragment from ATCC cosmid 70,897 was cloned into the SmaI site of this construct placing TRA1downstream of the promoter. The 5′ segment of TRA1 was synthesized by PCR, with a NotI site at the position of the translational start. Alleles expressing myc-NGG1 and HA-ADA2 have been described (5Brandl C.J. Martens J.A.

CY979 contains disruptions of ngg1 and gal80and has HM-NGG1 inserted at his3. CY1013, carrying a Tn10LUK disruption of TRA1 encompassing the coding region from amino acids 168 to 3618, was constructed in KY320 containing myc-TRA1-YCplac111. After selecting for the loss of URA3 (CY1020), the TRP1 marker onmyc-TRA1-YCplac111 was changed to URA3 by single step recombination to give CY1021 (22Cross F.R.

To construct a disruption allele of TRA1 for genetic analysis, tailed PCR was performed using a 5′-oligonucleotide containing 60 base pairs corresponding to the sequence immediately upstream of TRA1 followed by sequence from the 5′ end of HIS3. The 3′ primer included 3′ HIS3 sequence flanked by 60 base pairs corresponding to sequence immediately downstream of the TRA1 stop codon.HIS3-containing plasmid was used as template, and the resulting PCR fragment was used to transform the diploid strain YPH501 using lithium acetate (24Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar, 25Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were plated onto histidine-deficient media, and colonies were obtained. DNA was isolated from transformants and subjected either to NheI digestion and Southern analysis with a HIS3 probe or used as a template in PCR reactions designed to amplify the unique junctional region formed between sequences upstream of TRA1 and the recombined HIS3 gene. Sporulation and tetrad dissection were performed using standard techniques (26Sherman F. Hicks J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Yeast were grown at 30°C in YPD broth (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) or in minimal media (0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 2% glucose) and supplemented as required. Whole cell extract was prepared from 8-liter cultures of strains expressing HM-Ngg1p (CY979) or Myc-Ngg1p (CY1077) in Buffer E (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol and 0.1% Nonidet P-40; see Ref. 8Saleh A.

Chem. 1997; 272: 5571-5578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and 1.0 mm dithiothreitol were included in all solutions. 150 mg of protein (∼4 ml) was rotated with 1.5 ml of Sepharose CL-4B for 30 min at 4 °C. Unbound protein was rotated with 2.5 ml of Ni2+-nitriloacetic acid-agarose (Ni2+-NTA; Qiagen) for 1 h. The mix was applied to a column, washed with 50 ml of Buffer E, then consecutively with 5 ml of Buffer E containing 50 and 350 mm imidazole. Fractions were concentrated (Centricon-30; Amicon) and separated on a 6% SDS gel. From the Coomassie-stained gel of the 350 mm imidazole fraction, gel slices corresponding to an ∼400-kDa protein from theHM-NGG1 strain and its parallel position from themyc-NGG1 control were excised and washed with water for 20 min. Protein was eluted and in-gel trypsin digested by the method of Shevchenko et al. (27Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7819) Google Scholar). Protein was identified by micro-column high performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry and data base searching. A 100- by 200-μm fused silica capillary (Ref. 28Kennedy R.T. Jorgenson J.W. Anal. Chem. 1989; 61: 1128-1135Crossref Scopus (325) Google Scholar; Polymetrics, Inc.) was packed to a length of ∼15 cm with 10 mm POROS 10 R2 reverse phase material (Perspective Biosystems). The fritted end of the column was inserted into the needle of the electrospray ion source and sample loaded by helium pressurization in a stainless steel bomb (29Yates III, J.R. McCormack A.L. Hayden J.B. Davey M.P. Celis J.E. Cell Biology: A Laboratory Handbook. 3. Academic Press, San Diego1994: 380-388Crossref Google Scholar). Chromatography was performed with a dual syringe pump (Applied Biosystems). The mobile phase consisted of 0.5% acetic acid (solvent A) and 80:20 acetonitrile/water containing 0.5% acetic acid (solvent B). A 100:1 precolumn split was used to deliver a flow rate of 1 to 1.5 ml/min. The high performance liquid chromatography pump was programmed to ramp solvent B from 0 to 60% in 30 min. Electrospray ionization was carried out at voltage of 4.6 kV. Tandem mass spectra were acquired automatically during the entire gradient run (30Link A.J. Hays L.G. Carmack E.B. Yates III, J.R. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 1314-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Tandem mass spectra were searched against an S. cerevisiaeprotein data base (Saccharomyces Genome Data base) using the SEQUEST program (31Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Yates III, J.R. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1994; 5: 976-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (5442) Google Scholar). Parameters for the SEQUEST program were set to locate potential sites of phosphorylation at serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues (32Yates III, J.R. Eng J.K. McCormack A.L. Schieltz D. Anal. Chem. 1995; 67: 1426-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (1110) Google Scholar). Every sequence with high scores that matched a tandem mass spectrum was manually verified. 32 mg (2 ml) of a mixture of whole cell extract containing Myc-Tra1p, Spt7p, and Myc-Ngg1p was prepared in 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.7) buffer containing 20 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.08% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol. The extract was applied to an FPLC Mono Q column (1.0 ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 0.1 ml/min. After washing the column with 4 ml of the extraction buffer, protein was eluted with a 21-ml gradient of 20–700 mm NaCl at a flow rate of 0.25 ml/ml. Protein from 45-μl aliquots of 250-μl fractions was separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Myc and anti-Spt7p antibody. Similarly, extracts prepared from an ada2 deletion strain (CY927) expressing Myc-Tra1p (myc-TRA1 ada2) or from a wild-type strain (TRA1 ADA2) were cofractionated on the Mono Q column and the peak fraction containing Myc-Tra1p and/or Spt7p used for subsequent analysis. The peak fraction containing Myc-Tra1p, Spt7p, and Myc-Ngg1p from the ∼350 mm NaCl Mono Q fraction (Complex I) was dialyzed against DB buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.025% Nonidet P-40, 5% glycerol) and loaded onto a 0.5-ml DNA-cellulose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/h. After washing to remove unbound protein, bound protein was eluted with 0.6 ml of DNA-binding buffer containing 100, 300, and 500 mm NaCl and analyzed by Western blotting. The ∼250 mm NaCl Mono Q fraction from the ada2 strain CY927 was handled similarly. The DNA-cellulose fraction containing Myc-Tra1p, Spt7p, and Myc-Ngg1p (300 mm NaCl fraction) was dialyzed against 40 mm Tris-HCl buffer containing 300 mm NaCl, 4 μg/ml ethidium bromide, 10% glycerol, 0.08% Nonidet P-40, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol and loaded at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min onto an FPLC Superose 6HR10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Protein from 150-μl aliquots of 500-μl fractions was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, solubilized in SDS sample buffer, and separated on a 5.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Similarly, 16 mg of whole cell extract was prepared from strains expressing Myc-Tra1p, Spt7p, and Myc-Ngg1p, filtered through 0.22-mm membrane and applied to the Superose 6 column in the presence of ethidium bromide. Alternate fractions were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-Myc and anti-Spt7p antibody. Immunoprecipitation of HA-Ada2p and Myc-Tra1p from whole cell extracts was performed as described (8Saleh A. Lang V. Cook R. Brandl C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5571-5578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation from the Mono Q fraction containing Ada·Spt Complex I was done after adjusting the buffer to 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mmNaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 5% glycerol (IP buffer) in a volume of 1.5 ml. 150 μg of protein was rotated for 20 min with 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose. Unbound protein was rotated with 7 μl of ascites fluid (12CA5) and 50 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads for 3 h. Beads were washed four times with 1.5 ml of IP buffer and twice with 1.5 ml of buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 50 mm KCl, and 5% glycerol and then eluted in SDS loading buffer at 60 °C for 5 min and separated by SDS-PAGE. To analyze for the association of Spt7p with Tra1p in the presence and absence of Ada2p, protein from the ∼350 mm (50 μg) and ∼250 mm NaCl (70 μg) Mono Q eluting fractions from strains expressing Myc-Tra1p (KY320, myc-TRA1 ADA2; CY927, Myc-TRA1 ada2) and untagged Tra1p (TRA1 ADA2) were incubated with 4 μg of anti-Myc antibody and 15 μl of protein A-Sepharose after dialysis in IP buffer. Bound protein was eluted from the beads and analyzed by Western blotting for Spt7p. Western blotting with polyclonal anti-Spt7p antibody and monoclonal anti-Myc and HA antibodies has been described (5Brandl C.J. Martens J.A. Margaliot A. Stenning D. Furlanetto A.M. Saleh A.

(1998) J. Mol. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar). To search for components of the Ada·Spt complexes, we analyzed proteins associated with Ngg1p after affinity purification of Ngg1p from whole cell extracts. A derivative of NGG1 was constructed that encodes a protein with both six histidine and Myc-epitope tags (HM-Ngg1p). Extracts from a strain containing HM-NGG1 and as a control from a strain containing myc-NGG1 were loaded onto parallel Ni2+-NTA columns. HM-Ngg1p eluted from the Ni2+-NTA column with buffer containing 350 mmimidazole as compared with Myc-Ngg1p which eluted in 50 mmimidazole. 350 mm imidazole eluants from both strains were compared by SDS-PAGE, revealing potential HM-Ngg1p-associated proteins (not shown). One of these proteins had an apparent molecular mass of ∼400 kDa and thus did not match previously described Ada components. With the purification of the Ada components obtained by chromatography on Ni2+-NTA and the resolution afforded by its migration on SDS-PAGE, the ∼400-kDa protein was isolated and its identity determined by micro-column high performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry and data base searching. The gene product Tra1p (YHR099W) was identified from 36 unique peptides that correspond to 15.2% of the mass of the protein. TRA1encodes a protein of 3744 amino acids (433 kDa) with 20–50% sequence similarity throughout its length to TRRAP, a human protein that associates with c-Myc and E2F-1 (21McMahon S.B. Van Buskirk H.A. Dugan K.A. Copeland T.D. Cole M.D. Cell. 1998; 94: 363-374Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The absence of Tra1p in the parallel gel slice from the control strain suggested that its association with HM-Ngg1p was specific. In addition, mass spectrometry revealed that the peptide AEQGDLDSPKEPQADELLDEFSK between residues of 165 and 187 of Tra1p contained one phosphoserine. The approaches used to study further Tra1p in the Ada·Spt complexes depended on whetherTRA1 was essential for cellular viability. The entire 11.2-kb coding region of one TRA1 allele was replaced withHIS3 in the diploid strain YPH501. To ensure that aTRA1 allele was disrupted several isolatedHis + colonies were analyzed by Southern blotting. When correctly inserted into the TRA1 locus, theHIS3 disruption cassette generates an NheI fragment of 6.3 kb. When NheI-restricted genomic DNA was probed for HIS3, the predicted 6.3-kb band was visible in several of the transformed strains (Fig. 1 A, clones D1, D3, D4, and D5). This band is absent from wild-type strain YPH501 (lane 1) and from some of theHis + clones. The insertion of HIS3into TRA1 was also confirmed by PCR using primers that span the TRA1-HIS3 junction (not shown). Three representative strains containing the wild-type TRA1 gene and thetra1::HIS3 allele were sporulated and the resulting tetrads dissected. Although all spores from wild-type YPH501 were viable, tetrads from TRA1/tra1::his3 strains segregated for growth with a 2:2 ratio (Fig. 1 B), indicating that disruption of TRA1 is incompatible with growth. To allow biochemical and immunological approaches to verify the association of Tra1p with the Ada and Spt proteins, Tra1p was Myc-tagged at its amino terminus and inserted into a centromeric plasmid (myc-TRA1-YCplac111). The ability of this allele to functionally replace the wild-type allele was shown in a plasmid shuffle experiment. CY1021 contains myc-TRA1 on aURA3 centromeric in a background in which chromosomalTRA1 is disrupted. Growth of cells in the absence of the plasmid copy of TRA1 was determined in the presence and absence of myc-TRA1-YCplac111 by plating the cells on 5-fluoroorotic acid (Fig. 2). Cells containing myc-TRA1-YCplac111 were able to lose theURA3 plasmid and thus grow on 5-fluoroorotic acid, in contrast to CY1021 without myc-TRA1-YCPlac111. Ngg1p and Ada2p are intimately associated in multiple complexes, some of which contain the TBP class of Spt proteins (8Saleh A. Lang V. Cook R. Brandl C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5571-5578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 9Grant P.A. Duggan L. Cote J. Roberts S.M. Brownell J.E. Candau R. Ohba R. Owen-Hughes T. Allis C.D.

Biol. 1997; 17: 3220-3228Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To verify the interaction of Tra1p with the ADA components, we determined if Tra1p coimmunoprecipitates with Ada2p. Whole cell extracts were prepared from strains expressing myc-TRA1 and HA-ADA2independently and from a strain expressing both myc-TRA1 and HA-ADA2. HA-Ada2p and associated proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody, separated by SDS-PAGE, and Western blotted with anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 3 A). The presence of Myc-Tra1p in immunoprecipitates with HA-Ada2p (lane 3), but not in immunoprecipitates lacking either HA-Ada2p (lane 2) or Myc-Tra1p (lane 1), indicated that Tra1p associates with Ada2p. Reprobing the blot with anti-HA antibody demonstrated that equivalent amounts of HA-Ada2p were immunoprecipitated from theHA-ADA2 containing strains (not shown). The reciprocal experiment was performed in which Myc-Tra1p was immunoprecipitated and the presence of HA-Ada2p assayed by Western blotting. As a positive control an extract containing Myc-Ngg1p and HA-Ada2p was included. As shown in Fig. 3 B, HA-Ada2p was found in Myc immunoprecipitates from strains expressingmyc-TRA1 (lane 1) or myc-NGG1(lane 4) in combination with HA-ADA2 but not from the strain lacking myc-TRA1 (lane 3). No band was detected in the strain lacking HA-tagged Ada2p (lane 2). To determine if other components of the SAGA complex associate with Myc-Tra1p, the blot was reprobed with anti-Spt7p antibody. As with HA-Ada2p, Spt7p specifically coimmunoprecipitated with Myc-Tra1p and Myc-Ngg1p. In certain whole cell extracts Spt7p appeared as multiple bands (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1 and 4). These may arise as a result of the modification of Spt7p by ubiquitination (16Saleh, A., Collart, M., Martens, J. A., Genereaux, J., Allard, S., Cote', J., and Brandl, C. J. (1998) J. Mol. Biol., in pressGoogle Scholar), although the reason for variability in the appearance of the bands is unclear. To examine if Tra1p interacts with one or more of the Ada complexes, we compared the elution of Myc-Ngg1p, Spt7p, and Myc-Tra1p after fractionation by gel filtration and ion exchange chromatography. First, whole cell extract was chromatographed on a Superose 6 column, and equal volumes of alternate fractions were examined for Myc-Ngg1p, Spt7p, and Myc-Tra1p by Western blotting. As shown in the densitometric scanning profile in Fig. 4 and as described previously (8Saleh A. Lang V. Cook R. Brandl C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5571-5578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), Myc-Ngg1p elutes from this column in three peaks corresponding to complexes with sizes of approximately 2 MDa, 900 kDa, and 200 kDa. Spt7p coelutes with the 2-MDa complex(es). A peak of Spt7p eluting at fraction 20 (approximately 1.5 MDa) suggests the possibility of an Ada-independent Spt7p complex (see below). Myc-Tra1p eluted in the fractions corresponding to the 2-MDa complex(es). To analyze further the association of Myc-Tra1p with the Ada·Spt complexes, whole cell extract was chromatographed on an FPLC Mono Q column. Protein was eluted from a Mono Q column in a linear gradient of 20–700 mm NaCl with equal volumes of alternate fractions examined by Western blotting (Fig. 5 A). Myc-Ngg1p was found in three peaks at fractions 34 (∼350 mm NaCl), 48 (∼450 mm NaCl), and 68 (∼550 mm NaCl). Ada2p peaks with Ngg1p in each of these fractions (not shown, see Ref. 8Saleh A. Lang V. Cook R. Brandl C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5571-5578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Spt7p was present within the ∼350 mm NaCl fraction (Ada·Spt Complex I) and the ∼550 mm NaCl fraction (Ada·Spt Complex II) and perhaps coeluted with Ngg1p in the ∼450 mm NaCl fraction. The presence of Spt7p in fractions centered at fraction 52 again suggests that Spt7p may exist independently of Ngg1p. Myc-Tra1p cofractionated with Myc-Ngg1p and Spt7p in both Ada·Spt Complex I and Complex II but was absent from the ∼450 mm NaCl fraction. To confirm the association of Myc-Ngg1p, Myc-Tra1p, and Spt7p in Ada·Spt Complex I, these fractions were chromatographed consecutively through two additional steps. After dialysis, Complex I was loaded onto DNA-cellulose, and bound protein was eluted with buffer containing 50 (flow-through), 100, 300, and 500 mm NaCl (Fig. 5 B). Myc-Tra1p, Spt7p, and Myc-Ngg1p coeluted in buffer containing 300 mm NaCl. The 300 mm NaCl eluant from DNA-cellulose was then chromatographed on Superose 6 (Fig. 5 C). As predicted from gel filtration of crude extracts, Myc-Ngg1p, Myc-Tra1p, and Spt7p co-eluted in what corresponded to an approximately 2-MDa complex. As an additional step to demonstrate the association of Myc-Tra1p with the Ada/Spt proteins in Complex I, we immunoprecipitated HA-Ada2p from the ∼350 mm NaCl Mono Q fraction and analyzed by Western blotting for Myc-Tra1p and Spt7p (Fig. 6). Both of these proteins specifically coimmunoprecipitated with HA-Ada2p from Complex I (lane 2) as they did from a whole cell extract (lane 3). The amount of Myc-Tra1p in Complex II prohibited the same analyses done with Complex I. Therefore, to address whether coelution of Myc-Tra1p with the Ada·Spt components in this complex was indicative of their association, we analyzed whether removal of Ada2p altered the elution profile of Myc-Tra1p from gel filtration and ion exchange columns. As shown in Fig. 7, when extracts prepared from the ada2 deletion strain CY927 were chromatographed on a Mono Q column, Myc-Tra1p eluted in fractions centered at"

A triple mutant yeast lacking three glycosyltransferase activities was then transformed with an α-1,2-mannosidase expression vector.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae is useful for the production of recombinant proteins of biological interest because of the established expression system, and it can be easily grown in large quantities. Moreover, yeast share the early steps of the mammalian Asn-linked glycosylation pathway. However, the mature Asn-linked oligosaccharides of yeast are mannan glycans and are highly antigenic against mammals. Thus, it would be necessary to eliminate the antigenicity of the sugar chains when recombinant therapeutic glycoproteins are produced in yeast. Several genes concerned with the biosynthesis of yeast sugar chains have been cloned, and the glycosylation pathway of yeast has been clarified. The OCH1 gene encodes an α-1,6-mannosyltransferase that initiates α-1,6-polymannose outer chain formation on the Asn-linked inner oligosaccharide Man8GlcNAc2 in S. cerevisiae (1Nakanishi-Shindo Y. Nakayama K.I. Tanaka A. Toda Y. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26338-26345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).MNN1 has been proposed as the structural gene for the α-1,3-mannosyltransferase that elongates the outer chain and the inner core oligosaccharide (2Graham T.R. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 3Yip C.L. Welch S.K. Klebl F. Gilbert T. Seidel P. Grant F.J. O'Hara P.J. MacKay V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2723-2727Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The Δoch1 mnn1 double mutant accumulated a single oligosaccharide moiety, Man8GlcNAc2, a high mannose-type structure (1Nakanishi-Shindo Y. Nakayama K.I. Tanaka A. Toda Y. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26338-26345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mutant may be useful to produce recombinant therapeutic glycoproteins without any antigenicity toward humans. On the other hand, some glycoproteins of therapeutic value require complex-type sugar chains for their efficacy. Erythropoietin (EPO),1 a hematopoietic glycoprotein factor produced in the kidney, has three complex-type Asn-linked sugar chains and one mucin-type sugar chain. It is reported that the composition and structure of each sugar chain affected the biological activity, the efficiency of secretion, and had profound effects on the half-life of EPO in the blood circulation (4Takeuchi M. Kobata A. Glycobiology. 1991; 1: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). It seems that the most active form of the EPO molecule requires tetra-antennary Asn-linked sugar chains (5Takeuchi M. Inoue N. Strickland T.W. Kubota M. Wada M. Shimizu R. Hoshi S. Kozutsumi H. Takasaki S. Kobata A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7819-7822Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar) with full sialylation, to prevent serum clearance by the action of the hepatic asialoglycoprotein binding protein (6Fukuda M.N. Sasaki H. Lopez L. Fukuda M. Blood. 1989; 73: 84-89Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Spivak J.L. Hogans B.B. Blood. 1989; 73: 90-99Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When EPO was expressed in the Δoch1 mnn1mutant yeast, the recombinant EPO should have high mannose-type oligosaccharides, which are trapped by the mannan-binding proteins of serum, liver, and macrophages, or excreted in the urine through the kidney because of their small size. From the viewpoint of glycotechnology, we are trying to construct the mammalian-type glycosylation system in S. cerevisiae as a host to produce glycoprotein therapeutics (Fig. 1). The first aim of this research was to convert the mannan-type sugar chain of S. cerevisiaeto a Man5GlcNAc2 sugar chain, because it is an intermediate for hybrid- and complex-type sugar chains. However the Δoch1 mnn1 mutant can only produce the Man8GlcNAc2 structure (1Nakanishi-Shindo Y. Nakayama K.I. Tanaka A. Toda Y. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26338-26345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Further trimming of the mannose residues by α-1,2-mannosidase requires α-mannosidase I. Several α-1,2-mannosidases have been isolated from mammals, yeast, and fungi (8Yoshida T. Ichishima E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1263: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), and some mammalian α-1,2-mannosidase genes have been cloned (9Herscovics A. Schneikert J. Athanassiadis A. Moremen K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9864-9871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Lal A. Schutzbach J.S. Forsee W.T. Neame P.J. Moremen K.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9872-9881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). During preparation of the manuscript, it was reported that a truncated soluble form of the human α-1,2-mannosidase IB was expressed as a secreted protein in Pichia pastris (11Tremblay L.O. Campbell Dyke N. Herscovics A. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). TheS. cerevisiae α-1,2-mannosidase gene (MNS1) has been cloned (12Camirand A. Heysen A. Grondin B. Herscovics A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15120-15127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and expressed in S. cerevisiae. However, this enzyme only removes a specific single mannose residue from Man9GlcNAc2 and produces Man8GlcNAc2. The Aspergillusα-1,2-mannosidase gene (msdS) has also been cloned and has been expressed successfully in yeast cells as a chimeric gene with the signal sequence of the aspergillopepsin I gene from Aspergillus saitoi (13Inoue T. Yoshida T. Ichishima E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1253: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 14Fujita A. Yoshida T. Ichishima E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 779-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The recombinant α-1,2-mannosidase activity was secreted into the culture medium, indicating that the products of themsdS gene had passed through the yeast secretion pathway. Therefore, α-1,2-mannosidase could be used as a tool to produce the mammalian-type sugar chains in the yeast if this enzyme was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or Golgi apparatus. In yeast cells, the His-Asp-Glu-Leu (HDEL) C-terminal sequence of proteins acts as a retention/retrieval signal for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (15Pelham H.R. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Proteins with an HDEL sequence are bound by a membrane-bound receptor (Erd2p) (16Lewis M.J. Pelham H.R. Nature. 1990; 348: 162-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 17Semenza J.C. Hardwick K.G. Dean N. Pelham H.R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1349-1357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar) and then enter a retrograde transport pathway for return to the ER from the Golgi apparatus. In this study, the expression of the A. saitoiα-1,2-mannosidase in the ER was demonstrated by adding “HDEL” to the C terminus of the α-1,2-mannosidase open reading frame. The introduced α-1,2-mannosidase was also shown to convert Asn-linked oligosaccharides into Man5GlcNAc2, the intermediate form for hybrid- and complex-type sugar chains, in mutant yeast cells with disruptions in three of the original mannosyltranferase genes (OCH1, MNN1, and MNN4). The enzyme activity and the localization of the HDEL-tagged MsdSp was determined in S. cerevisiae pep4 disrupted YPH500 cells (MATα ura3–52 lys2–801 ade2–101 trp1-Δ63 his3-Δ200 leu2-Δ1 pep4::ADE2) (18Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). YS132–8B (MATαoch1::LEU2 mnn1::URA3 mnn4::LYS2 leu2-Δ1 ura3–52 trp1-Δ1 lys2–801AM his3-Δ200 ade2–101OC), which had been constructed by standard genetic methods (19Sherman F. Hicks J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 21-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), were used to analyze the Asn-linked sugar chains of carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) or mannoproteins. All strains were transformed by the method of Ito et al. (20Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on synthetic minimal dextrose (SD) medium with auxotrophic supplements. For preparation of the HDEL-tagged MsdSp, the tag sequence was introduced by amplifying the 0.6-kilobase region between the HindIII site and the stop codon of themsdS gene with the following mutation primers: 5′-TGCGCCCGGAAGTGATTGAA-3′ and 5′-CCTACAATTCGTCGTGTGTACTACTCACCCGCACTGG-3′. The polymerase chain reaction product was subcloned into pCR-Script Amp SK(+) (Stratagene) and digested with HindIII and NotI. The coding region of the C-terminal domain of pGAM1, an expression plasmid forA. saitoi α-1,2-mannosidase (13Inoue T. Yoshida T. Ichishima E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1253: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), was substituted with the recovered 0.6-kilobase HindIII-NotI fragment to create the pGAMH1 plasmid. The msdS and insertion sequence were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Man6GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide was obtained from Seikagaku Co. (Tokyo, Japan) and labeled with 2-aminopyridine (21Kondo A. Suzuki J. Kuraya N. Hase S. Kato I. Ikenaka T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1990; 54: 2169-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Pyridylaminated oligosaccharide (Man6GlcNAc2-PA) was purified by gel filtration (TOYOPEARL HW-40, 1.6 × 73 cm, Tosoh Corp., Japan) and the purity confirmed by reversed-phase HPLC using an ODS-80TM column (0.46 × 15 cm, Tosoh Corp.). Yeast cell extracts were prepared as described below. Yeast cells were cultured on SD medium lacking tryptophan. The cell density was determined at 600 nm using a 10-mm cuvette. The pelleted cells were washed with deionized water, resuspended in extraction buffer (0.1m sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 1% Triton X-100), and vortex mixed with acid-washed glass beads (425–600 μm diameter). Soluble cell extract was separated from cell debris by centrifugation and assayed for activity. Samples containing 10–100 μg of protein were incubated for 30 min with 150 pmol of Man6GlcNAc2-PA in 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) at 37 °C. The assay was stopped by boiling, and the sample was filtrated using an Ultrafree-MC centrifugal filter unit (0.22 μm pore size low-binding Durapore, Millipore). The filtrates were analyzed by HPLC with a Hitachi F-1050 fluorescence spectrophotometer, using an ODS-80TM column (4.6 × 150 mm). The solvent and elution conditions used are as described by Kondo et al. (21Kondo A. Suzuki J. Kuraya N. Hase S. Kato I. Ikenaka T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1990; 54: 2169-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). One unit of the enzyme was defined as the amount of enzyme that was required to liberate 1 μmol of mannose from Man6GlcNAc2-PA per min at 30 °C and pH 5.0. NADH cytochrome P-450 reductase, a marker enzyme for the ER, guanosine diphosphatase, a marker enzyme for the Golgi apparatus, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, a cytosol marker, were assayed as described (22Kubota S. Yoshida Y. Kumaoka H. Furumichi A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1977; 81: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 23Abeijon C. Orlean P. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Rabbit anti-MsdSp and rabbit anti-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase antisera were obtained from Sawaday Technology (Tokyo, Japan). Mouse anti-CPY monoclonal antibody 10A5-B5, mouse anti-alkaline phosphatase monoclonal antibody 1D3-A10, and mouse anti-dolichol phosphate mannose synthase monoclonal antibody 5C5-A7 were purchased from Molecular Probes, Inc. (Eugene, OR). Samples containing 1 μg of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE. SDS-PAGE was carried out using the buffer system of Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) in 10% gel. Electroblotting of the fractionated proteins onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.) was carried out by the method of Towbin et al. (26Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar), and detection was performed essentially according to the method of Hsu et al.(27Hsu S.-M. Raine L. Fanger H. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1981; 29: 577-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (13474) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in SD medium and were converted to spheroplasts by the method of Vita et al. (28Vida T.A. Graham T.R. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2871-2884Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The following procedures were also performed at 4 °C. The spheroplasts were harvested by centrifugation. The spheroplasts were resuspended in a hypoosmotic lysis buffer (0.25 m sorbitol, 10 mm triethanolamine (pH 7.2), 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF, antipain (2 μg/ml), chymostatin (2 μg/ml), pepstatin A (3 μg/ml), leupeptin (2 μg/ml)) and homogenized for up to 20 times using a glass tissue homogenizer. The lysate was centrifuged at 220 × g for 5 min to remove unlysed spheroplasts. The 220 × gsupernatant (CL) was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min to separate the low speed pellet (LSP) and supernatant fractions. The supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 80 min to separate the high speed pellet (HSP) and supernatant fractions (HSS). The LSP and HSP were resuspended by sonication on ice in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100. Aliquots of the LSP, HSP and HSS fractions were used to assay α-1,2-mannosidase, NADH cytochrome P-450 reductase, guanosine diphosphatase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activities and were also subjected to Western blot analyses. Aliquots (200 μl) of the resuspended LSP fraction were placed on top of four 1.8-ml 1.2/1.5 m discontinuous sucrose gradients containing 10 mm triethanolamine (pH 7.2). After centrifugation at 80,000 × g in an RT-100T Beckman Ultracentrifuge at 4 °C for 65 min, 200 μl each were collected from the top of each gradient and pooled. Aliquots of the pools were resuspended as described above and were subjected to Western blot analysis. Recombinant endo-H was purchased from Genzyme Co. (Boston, MA). Yeast cell extracts were prepared as described above. Aliquots (containing 15 μg of proteins) of cell extracts were brought to 50 μl of 50 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.1% SDS and 1 mm PMSF and denatured at 100 °C for 5 min. After dilution with 50 mm sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 1 mm PMSF, 0.5 milliunits of endo-H was added to the sample and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. Samples that substituted buffer for endo-H were used as negative controls. The samples containing 1 μg of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and analyzed by Western blotting with mouse anti-CPY antibody. p-Aminobenzylsuccinic acid was purchased from Sigma. CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, and glycyl-tyrosine was purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan). CPY produced in YS132–8B cells harboring pG3 or pGAMH was purified using affinity column chromatography. The affinity gel was prepared by coupling the specific inhibitor, p-aminobenzylsuccinic acid, via an azo linkage to Sepharose-glycyl-tyrosine as described by Johansen et al. (29Johansen J.T. Breddam K. Ottesen M. Carlsberg Res. Commun. 1976; 41: 1-14Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Before use, the column (1.0 × 3.0 cm) was equilibrated with 10 mm MES buffer (pH 5.0). S. cerevisiae YS132–8B and transformed YS132–8B cells were cultivated in SD medium containing 0.3 m sorbitol at 30 °C and harvested at stationary phase. The culture was centrifuged at 220 × g for 5 min, and the pellet was disrupted as described above. The yeast cell lysate was applied to the column and washed extensively with 500 ml of 1 m NaCl in 10 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.3). Elution was performed with 10 mm phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The eluate was concentrated by Centricon-10 (Nihon Millipore Ltd., Japan) and applied to SDS-PAGE. The purified CPY was lyophilized and subjected to Asn-linked oligosaccharide analysis. S. cerevisiaeYS132–8B and transformed YS132–8B cells were cultivated in SD medium containing 0.3 m sorbitol at 30 °C and harvested at mid-log phase. Mannoproteins were extracted by hot citrate buffer (0.1m citrate buffer, pH 7.0) followed by precipitation with ethanol (30Peat, S., Whelan, W. J., and Edwards, T. E. (1961)J. Chem. Soc., 29–34Google Scholar). The precipitates were further purified by a Concanavalin A-agarose column (0.8 × 2 cm, Honen Corp., Japan), which was equilibrated with Con A buffer (0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.2) containing 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm MnCl2, and 1 mm CaCl2). The column was eluted by the Con A buffer containing 0.2 mα-methyl-d-mannoside. The eluted fractions were dialyzed against water and lyophilized. N-glycanase was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim GmbH (Mannheim, Germany). CPY or mannoproteins were dissolved in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) containing 0.5% SDS and 50 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and then denatured at 100 °C for 5 min. After dilution with 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer and addition of 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 2.5 units of N-glycanase was added to the sample and incubated for 16 h at 37 °C. Liberated Asn-linked oligosaccharides were separated from the salts and peptides using an AG 501-X8 mixed bed resin (Bio-Rad), and from Nonidet P-40 using Bio-Beads S-X8 (Bio-Rad). Reductive pyridylamination and structural analyses of the purified oligosaccharides were carried out essentially according to the method of Kondo et al. (21Kondo A. Suzuki J. Kuraya N. Hase S. Kato I. Ikenaka T. Agric. Biol. Chem. 1990; 54: 2169-2170Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Pyridylaminated (PA−) oligosaccharides were analyzed by HPLC using a size-fractionation column (TSKgel Amide-80, 4.6 × 250 mm, Tosoh Corp.) and a reversed-phase column (TSKgel ODS-80TM, 4.6 × 150 mm). Authentic PA-oligosaccharides and PA-glucose oligomer were purchased from Takara Shuzo Co. (Kyoto, Japan). Measurement of α-1,2-mannosidase activity by the Nelson-Somogyi method was attempted but was not sensitive enough to detect the amount of enzyme present. We have developed a new assay for α-1,2-mannosidase using a fluorescent oligosaccharide. PA-oligosaccharide made it possible to assay picomole per minute-ordered enzyme activity. For the assay of the α-1,2-mannosidase activity in vitro, we used Man6GlcNAc2-PA oligosaccharide as a substrate. The optimal assay conditions, such as enzyme concentration, reaction time, and substrate concentration were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” A soluble form of A. saitoi α-1,2-mannosidase was constructed with the HDEL ER retention/retrieval signal sequence at the C terminus. This construct was subcloned into the multicopy plasmid pG3, termed pGAMH1, and was used to transform S. cerevisiae YPH500 cells. α-1,2-Mannosidase activity that converted Man6GlcNAc2-PA substrate into Man5GlcNAc2-PA was observed in the cell extracts of the recombinant yeast with the pGAMH1 vector (Fig. 2 B), whereas there was no such activity in the extract of the recombinant yeast transfected with the pG3 vector only (Fig. 2 A). The activity of ER α-1,2-mannosidase and vacuole α-mannosidase in yeast were not detected under these assay conditions. Four milliunits of the enzyme activity was recovered from a 500-ml yeast culture. To determine the localization of the expressed α-1,2-mannosidase in yeast, we investigated the subcellular distribution of the enzyme. Fig. 3 A illustrates the protocol for the fractionation of the yeast cells. The α-1,2-mannosidase activity was localized primarily in the LSP fraction (77%) (Table I). The LSP fraction also contained 69% of NADPH cytochrome P-450 reductase (ER marker) (31te Heesen S. Rauhut R. Aebersold R. Abelson J. Aebi M. Clark M.W. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 56: 8-18PubMed Google Scholar, 32te Heesen S. Janetzky B. Lehle L. Aebi M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2071-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In contrast, most of the guanosine diphosphatase (70%), a Golgi marker (23Abeijon C. Orlean P. Robbins P.W. Hirschberg C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Open table in a new tab Each enzyme activity was assayed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Recovery present in 220 × g supernatant (CL) was taken as 100 %. The Western blot pattern also showed that the ER marker protein (dolichol phosphate mannose synthase) and the vacuolar membrane protein (alkaline phosphatase) were localized in the LSP fraction, whereas both CPY, which is a soluble protein in the vacuole, and cytosolic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were fractionated in HSS fraction (Fig. 3 B). The introduced α-1,2-mannosidase gene products were detected in the LSP fraction. Because it is known that the LSP fraction contained the vacuole in addition to the ER (34Gaynor E.C. te Heesen S. Graham T.R. Aebi M. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 653-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), discontinuous sucrose density centrifugation was performed to determine whether the expressed α-1,2-mannosidase was localized in the ER or the vacuole (Fig. 4). Alkaline phosphatase, a vacuolar marker enzyme, was distributed to fractions 1–3, the most light density fraction. In contrast, dolichol phosphate mannose synthase, an ER marker, was distributed to fractions 4–6. This result indicated that the vacuole and ER are well separated from each other in this system. The signals of the α-1,2-mannosidase appeared around fraction 5. The results strongly suggested that the α-1,2-mannosidase with the HDEL-tag is mainly localized in the ER. The apparent molecular mass of the CPY produced in the recombinant yeasts was analyzed on SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis. YS132–8B, which has disrupted OCH1, MNN1, and MNN4 genes, will not have any outer mannosyl chains on its glycoproteins. As shown in Fig. 5, the CPY from YS132–8B carrying the null vector gave a single signal with an apparent molecular mass of 62 kDa on SDS-PAGE. However the CPY from YS132–8B harboring the pGAMH1 plasmid gave an additional signal below the original one, indicating that the sugar chains of the CPY have been trimmed by the introduced α-1,2-mannosidase. Treatment of each cell lysate with endo-H gave a single signal of an N-deglycosylated CPY (Fig. 5,third and fourth lanes). The oligosaccharide structures of glycoproteins produced in these yeasts were analyzed using CPY as a model glycoprotein. While the sugar chains of CPY produced in the yeast with the null vector were eluted at the Man8GlcNAc2-PA position on the amide column (Fig. 6A, graph a), those produced in the yeast with the pGAMH1 plasmid showed four peaks at positions corresponding from Man5GlcNAc2-PA to Man8GlcNAc2-PA, respectively (Fig. 6A,graph b). The molar ratio of each glycoform was Man5GlcNAc2-PA:Man6GlcNAc2-PA:Man7GlcNAc2-PA:Man8GlcNAc2-PA = 27:22:22:29. The fraction eluted at the position corresponding to Man5GlcNAc2-PA (indicated with a open arrow in Fig. 6 A) was pooled and subjected to reversed-phase chromatography. Only one peak was observed at the same position as authentic Manα1–3[Manα1–3(Manα1–6)Manα1–6]Manβ1–4GlcNAcβ1–4GlcNAc-PA (Fig. 6 B); this is the smallest structure of mammalian-type high-mannose sugar chains. Besides CPY, we also investigated the oligosaccharide structures of cell wall mannoproteins. As shown in Fig. 6 C, the mannoproteins produced in the yeast with the pGAMH1 plasmid contained Man5GlcNAc2. The molar ratio of each glycoform in mannoproteins was Man5GlcNAc2-PA:Man6GlcNAc2-PA:Man7GlcNAc2-PA:Man8GlcNAc2-PA = 10:13:16:61. α-Mannosidase I digests α-1,2-mannosidic linkages and converts Man8GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide into Man5GlcNAc2. This is the first step in the biosynthesis of hybrid-type and complex-type sugar chains from high mannose-type sugar chains. There are several successive enzymatic reactions necessary to complete complex-type structures.N-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GnT)-I, α-mannosidase II, GnT-II, β-1,4-galactosyltransferase, etc. work in succession in mammalian cells. Since the α-1,2-mannosidase acts upstream in the biosynthetic pathway of oligosaccharides, it must be located either in the ER or the early Golgi apparatus to reconstruct this system in yeast. We have already succeeded in expressing the A. saitoiα-1,2-mannosidase as a chimeric protein with a transmembrane domain of Och1p (data not shown). Although Och1p resides in the early Golgi apparatus of yeast (35Lussier M. Sdicu A.M. Ketela T. Bussey H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 913-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the expressed chimeric enzyme was localized not only in the Golgi apparatus, but also in the ER and the cytosol fractions. We could not detect any Man5GlcNAc2sugar chain structure in the recombinant yeast (data not shown). Evidence suggested that the mislocalization of the chimeric α-1,2-mannosidase prevented the trimming of sugar chains in the yeast. In this study, we attempted to localize the α-1,2-mannosidase to the yeast ER using a retention/retrieval signal. There has been several retention/retrieval systems proposed to date. Some of these systems require a transmembrane domain and/or a cytoplasmic tail. Xaa-Xaa-Arg-Arg (XXRR; X is any amino acid) in the N-terminal cytoplasmic region and Lys-Lys-Xaa-Xaa (KKXX), in the C-terminal cytoplasmic domain of membrane proteins are known as retrieval signals for the ER. It has also been demonstrated that the N-terminal 16 amino acids of the alkaline phosphatase in the cytoplasmic tail contain a vacuolar sorting signal in S. cerevisiae (36Cowles C.R. Snyder W.B. Burd C.G. Emr S.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2769-2782Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). Lussier et al. reported that an N-terminal cytoplasmic domain was necessary for Kre2p to correctly localize in the Golgi apparatus and that the entire Kre2p cytoplasmic tail plus the transmembrane domain and 36 amino acids in the luminal stem region were required to localize a Pho8p reporter protein in the yeast Golgi apparatus (35Lussier M. Sdicu A.M. Ketela T. Bussey H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 913-927Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). These results suggested that there is no accurate signal for the retention of exogenous membrane proteins in the ER or Golgi apparatus of yeast. Therefore, we constructed an expression vector with an HDEL signal for the transfer of soluble α-1,2-mannosidase proteins from the Golgi apparatus to the ER. In yeast, two α-mannosidases have been found, and these have different substrate specificity and pH optima to the A. saitoi α-1,2-mannosidase. S. cerevisiae ER α-mannosidase (Mns1p) cannot act on Man6GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide, and vacuolar α-mannosidase (Ams1p) cannot act at pH 5.0. Whereas A. saitoi α-1,2-mannosidase can remove the α-1,2-linked mannose of Man6GlcNAc2 oligosaccharide at pH 5.0. Based on these facts, we have developed an assay method that specifically detects A. saitoi α-1,2-mannosidase activity. The subcellular fractionation experiments indicated that the product of the msdS gene was mainly localized in the LSP fraction (Fig. 3), which includes the ER, vacuole, and plasma membrane. However, it is unlikely that MsdSp was localized in the vacuole, because the signal distribution of MsdSp was quite different from that of CPY, which is the vacuolar marker (Fig. 3). Furthermore, MsdSp will never be anchored at the plasma membrane because it is a soluble protein. The fractionation in the sucrose discontinuous gradients also showed that the signal distribution of the product of the msdS gene did not match with that of the vacuole but with that of the ER. CPY was chosen as one of the reporter glycoproteins to analyze the glycosylation phenotype of the genetically constructed yeast, because it has four Asn-linked oligosaccharides of known structure (37Trimble R.B. Maley F. Chu F.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 2562-2567Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and it has an established purification method (29Johansen J.T. Breddam K. Ottesen M. Carlsberg Res. Commun. 1976; 41: 1-14Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The triple mutant strain (YS132–8B) used in this study lacks three of the yeast mannosyltransferase activities, and the elongation of N-glycan is terminated at the Man8GlcNAc2 structure (1Nakanishi-Shindo Y. Nakayama K.I. Tanaka A. Toda Y. Jigami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26338-26345Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is a substrate for the α-1,2-mannosidase. Structural analysis of the CPY sugar chains produced in the mutant yeast harboring the pGAMH1 plasmid showed that the introduced α-1,2-mannosidase digested the sugar chains up to Man5GlcNAc2 (Fig. 6). The fact that the mannoproteins of the yeast with pGAMH1 vector also had the Man5GlcNAc2 structure suggests that the introduced α-1,2-mannosidase could digest the oligosaccharide chains of secretary proteins. The observed lower molar ratio of Man5GlcNAc2 in mannoproteins might be because of the cell harvesting period; the mannoproteins were recovered at mid-log phase of the culture, whereas CPY was done at stationary phase. Because there were also intermediates ranging from Man8GlcNAc2 to Man6GlcNAc2 both on CPY and mannoproteins, the expression level of the introduced α-1,2-mannosidase seemed not to be sufficient for complete trimming of each sugar chain. It might be more suitable to produce therapeutic glycoproteins using a vector with an inducible promoter, such as CUP1 or GAL1promoter. We could induce production of a target protein after stationary phase, where α-1,2-mannosidase would be sufficiently expressed to convert all of the sugar chains to Man5GlcNAc2. In this study, S. cerevisiae was manipulated to produce Man5GlcNAc2 N-glycan. Increasing the efficiency of the α-1,2-mannosidase reaction remains to be done. Furthermore, the Man5GlcNAc2 N-glycan is a hybrid and a complex-type intermediate, the latter of which is better suited and more effective for human therapeutics. We have already succeeded in expressing GnT-I, GnT-II, and β-1,4-galactosyltransferase activities in yeast, but to make hybrid- and complex-type sugar chains in yeast cells, co-expression of GnT-I and α-1,2-mannosidase is required and is an object of our future research. We thank Dr. Y. Shimma for providing the YS132–8B strain and S. Ogino for valuable assistance with this research. We are also grateful to Dr. M. Zimbo for helpful suggestions."

Bile acids are the predominant organic solutes in bile. Only 5% of the total bile acid pool is produced daily as a result of 7 α hydroxylation of cholesterol in the liver; the remaining 95% of bile acids undergoes enterohepatic circulation and is transferred into the bile from plasma by mechanisms that are only partially understood (1Hofman A.F.

Hepatology. 1991; 14: 551-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Three bile acid transporters have been identified in the basolateral plasma membrane of hepatocytes, but none are known to associate with vesicular trafficking of bile acids to the canaliculus (3Ananthanarayanan M. Ng O.C. Boyer J.L. Suchy F.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 267: G637-G643PubMed Google Scholar, 4Wolkoff A.W. Semin. Liver Dis. 1996; 16: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 5Von Dippe P. Amoui M. Alves C. Levy D. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: G528-G534PubMed Google Scholar). Although bile acids bind with varied affinity to several hepatocellular cytoplasmic proteins (6Stolz A. Hammond L. Lou H. Takikawa H. Ronk M. Shively J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10448-10457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the role of protein binding in intracellular movement is uncertain. Because administration of microtubular inhibitors, such as colchicine, reduces bile acid secretion but not uptake from plasma, a microtubule-based vesicular mechanism of transcellular bile acid transport has been proposed (7Crawford J.M. Berken C.A. Gollan J.L. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 144-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,8Erlinger S. Arias I.M. Boyer J.L. Fausto N. Jacoby W.V. Schachter D.A. Shafritz D.A.

In recent years, several ATP-dependent transporters have been functionally identified in CMVs1 for bile acids, organic cations, phosphatidylcholine, and nonbile acid organic anions (9Nishida T.

Additional canalicular bile acid transporters may be present. CMVs also manifest bile acid and nonbile acid organic anion transport, which is driven by a non-ATP-dependent membrane potential (18Inoue M. Kinne R. Tran T. Arias I.M. Hepatology. 1982; 2: 572-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 19Meier P.J. Sztul E.S. Reuben A. Boyer J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar); whether different transporters are involved in these processes is controversial (19Meier P.J. Sztul E.S. Reuben A. Boyer J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1984; 98: 991-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). While studying the function of the phosphatidylcholine translocator, MDR3 (human)/mdr2 (rat) in rat liver, we observed that ATP-dependent phosphatidylcholine translocation from the inner to the outer leaflet of the canalicular membrane is enhanced by addition of taurocholate in vitro (20Nies A.T. Gatmaitan Z. Arias I.M. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 1125-1136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and in vivo (21Gatmaitan Z.C. Nies A.T. Arias I.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1041-G1049PubMed Google Scholar). The latter observation prompted consideration that subcellular localization, trafficking, and regulation of canalicular ATP-dependent transporters may play an important role in normal bile secretion and in cholestasis. Administration of taurocholate in vivo resulted in specific increase in all known ATP-dependent transporters in the canalicular membrane, as well as canalicular ectoenzymes and cCAM 105, a canalicular adhesion molecule; the effects were prevented by pretreatment with colchicine (21Gatmaitan Z.C. Nies A.T. Arias I.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1041-G1049PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggested that canalicular ATP-dependent transporters undergo microtubule-dependent trafficking. Additional evidence for recruitment of canalicular bile acid transporters is provided by kinetic studies that suggest that the ATP-dependent transporters for bile acids and nonbile acid organic anions are saturated under basal conditions (12Muller M. Ishikawa R. Berger U. Klunemann C. Lucka L. Schreyer A. Kannicht C. Ruetter W. Kurz G. Keppler D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18920-18926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Stieger B. O'Neill B. Meier P.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 284: 67-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Therefore, we proposed that the substantial increase in bile acid secretion after taurocholate administration in vivo could result from either rapid transporter activation or recruitment to the canalicular domain (21Gatmaitan Z.C. Nies A.T. Arias I.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1041-G1049PubMed Google Scholar). Incubation of CMVs with taurocholate increased ATP-dependent bile acid transport by 15%; however, similar studies in CMVs after administration of taurocholate in vivo resulted in over 100% increase within 10 min, suggesting that transporter mobilization is the likely mechanism (21Gatmaitan Z.C. Nies A.T. Arias I.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1041-G1049PubMed Google Scholar). In hepatocytes, newly synthesized canalicular ectoenzymes, such as 5′-nucleotidase and dipeptidyl peptidase IV, and adhesion molecules, such as cCAM 105, are transported from the trans-Golgi network to the basolateral plasma membrane domain, from which they undergo transcytosis to the canalicular plasma membrane domain (22Barr V.A. Hubbard A.L. Gastroenterology. 1993; 105: 554-571Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 23Bartles J.R. Feracci H.M. Stieger B. Hubbard A.L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1241-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). The intracellular trafficking of canalicular ATP-dependent transporters has not been determined; however, new evidence suggests that these proteins traffic from the trans-Golgi network to subapical endosomes and/or directly to the canalicular plasma membrane. 2A. Nies, Y. Sai, and H. Kipp, personal communication. Recent studies indicate that PI3-kinase, which is involved in growth factor receptor-mediated signaling cascades leading to mitogenic responses, is also required for membrane trafficking (24Liscovitch M. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1995; 81: 659-662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 25De Camilli P. Emr S.D. McPherson P.S. Novick P. Science. 1996; 271: 1533-1539Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). The first indication that PI 3-kinase and its lipid products participate in intracellular membrane trafficking was the observation that Vps34p, which is required for intracellular trafficking in yeast, shares sequence homology with the catalytic subunit (p110) of mammalian type 1 PI 3-kinase (26Schu P.V. Takegawa K. Fry M.J. Stack J.H. Waterfield M.D. Emr S.D. Science. 1993; 260: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). Mammalian type 1 PI 3-kinases phosphorylate PI, PI 4-phosphate, and PI 4,5-bisphosphate to produce PI 3-phosphate, PI 3,4-bisphosphate, and PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate, respectively (27Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). PI 3,4-bisphosphate and PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate are absent in resting cells and rapidly appear after cell activation (28Auger K.R. Serunian L.A. Soltoff S.P. Libby P. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1989; 57: 167-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Yeast cannot produce PI 3,4-bisphosphate or PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate; however, these lipids may play a role in regulating vesicular trafficking in higher eukaryotic cells (27Toker A. Cantley L.C. Nature. 1997; 387: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (1225) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, (p85/p110) PI 3-kinase is required for platelet-derived growth factor-dependent delivery of the platelet-derived growth factor receptor to lysosomes (29Joly M. Kazlauskas A. Fay F.S. Corvera S. Science. 1994; 263: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) and for insulin-dependent trafficking of the glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) to the plasma membrane (30Frevert E.U. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). The present study was designed to determine whether recruitment of taurocholate-induced ATP-dependent transporters or cCAM 105 to the canalicular and basolateral plasma membrane domains is associated with or results from changes in PI 3-kinase activity. We measured PI 3-kinase activity in rat CMVs and SMVs after treatmentin vivo with taurocholate, colchicine, and a PI 3-kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, which, at the doses used, specifically inhibits PI 3-kinase activity (31Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). Protein levels were measured in CMV and SMV fractions using antibodies against the transporters, cCAM 105, and PI 3-kinase. The results were correlated with bile acid secretion in vivo and protein levels of PI 3-kinase, cCAM 105, and ATP-dependent transporters in SMV and CMV fractions. Our study revealed that PI 3-kinase is required for microtubule-based transcytosis of bile acids and targeting of ATP-dependent transporters to the bile canalicular domain.

Forty-five min later, rats were killed, and the liver was rapidly perfused at room temperature with 0.25 m sucrose and 10 mm HEPES-Tris that contained protease inhibitors (2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl chloride, and 5 μg/ml benzamidine), and homogenized in 5 volumes of buffer. Other rats were injected with 2.5 mg of colchicine/kg 2.5 h before taurocholate treatment and killed 45 min later. CMVs were isolated from liver homogenates by nitrogen cavitation and Ca2+ precipitation (32Inoue M. Kinne R. Tran T. Biempica L. Arias I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 5183-5188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and SMVs were isolated by sucrose/Ficoll gradient centrifugation as described previously (18Inoue M. Kinne R. Tran T. Arias I.M. Hepatology. 1982; 2: 572-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). CMV purity was determined using leucine amino peptidase (33Roman L.M. Hubbard A.L. J. Cell Biol. 1983; 96: 1548-1558Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and γ-glutamyltransferase (34Orlowski M. Meister M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1963; 73: 679-681Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With respect to the activity in homogenate, enrichment was 50–70-fold with leucine amino peptidase and 20–30-fold with γ-glutamyltransferase. The yield of CMVs was 1–1.2 mg of protein/60 g of rat liver. SMV purity was determined by measuring Na+- and K+-ATPase activity; enrichment was 30–50-fold higher in SMVs than in homogenate. The yield of SMVs was 3–5 mg of protein/60 g of rat liver. Protein was determined by the method of Bradford using bovine serum albumin as standard and Bio-Rad dye. Rats were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg), and nonrecirculating single pass liver perfusion was performed according to Hems et al. (35Hems R. Ross B.D. Berry M.N. Krebs H.A. Biochem J. 1966; 101: 284-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). Briefly, the common bile duct was cannulated with PE-10 tubing; the pancreatic duodenal branch of the portal vein was ligated; and the portal vein and hepatic vein were cannulated with a 14-gauge Teflon catheter. The effect of wortmannin on taurocholate secretion was determined using two protocols. In the first, the liver was constantly perfused at 37 °C with 30 ml/min with CO2/O2 (5%/95%) oxygenated Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer containing 5.5 mm glucose, 200 units of heparin/100 ml, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 100 μm taurocholate. [3H]Taurocholate (2 × 107 cpm) was added to the perfusion buffer after 10 min. Liver viability was achieved by maintaining portal pressure (average 10 cm of H2O), O2 supply, temperature, and buffer pH (7.35–7.40) throughout the perfusion. Bile was collected at 3-min intervals, and samples were weighed to determine volume and secretion of [3H]taurocholate. The effluent perfusion buffer was also collected for measurement of [3H]taurocholate. Wortmannin was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide, diluted to 100 nm in buffer immediately prior to use. Taurocholate (100 μm) was infused at 30 ml/min for 30 min, at which time wortmannin was added to taurocholate and infused for an additional 30-min period. [3H]Taurocholate secretion was measured in bile collected at 3-min intervals before and after wortmannin treatment. In a second protocol, wortmannin (100 nm) was infused in Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer for 30 min, at which time taurocholate (100 μm), [3H]taurocholate (2 × 107 cpm), and fresh wortmannin (100 nm) were infused for an additional 30 min. In both protocols, the liver was removed after perfusion, and basolateral and canalicular membrane vesicles were prepared and characterized. Two hundred fifty ng of CMV and SMV protein were used for each assay. Assays were performed in a reaction mixture containing 0.001% Nonidet P-40, 150 μm ATP, 125 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 25 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, and 0.2 mg/ml sonicated lipids PI-4,5-bisphosphate (1:1:1) (36Whitman M. Kaplan D.R. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L. Nature. 1985; 315: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 37Susa M. Keeler M. Varticovski L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22951-22956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in sonication buffer (25 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 1 mm EGTA), 25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP/assay at a final concentration of 150 μm in a total volume of 50 μl. The reactions proceeded at 37 °C for 20 min and were stopped with 100 μl of CH3OH:1 n HCl (1:1). Lipids were extracted twice with 100 μl of chloroform. The organic layer was combined, dried under nitrogen, and analyzed by TLC.32P-Labeled PI phosphates were resolved in water:acetic acid:n-propanol (34:1:65) and detected by autoradiography.32P incorporation was quantified by liquid scintillation counting of TLC spots, which were scraped and eluted in scintillation fluid. CMV and SMV preparations were denatured at 60 °C for 5 min and loaded (25–50 μg of protein) onto a 10% polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was performed on a Bio-Rad minigel apparatus. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked for 1 h with PBS containing 7% nonfat milk, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Tween 20. Membranes were washed and probed with one of the following antibodies: p85, C219, spgp, EAG15, or Ab65. The second antibodies used were anti-rabbit IgG (New England Biolabs) and goat anti-mouse IgG (Bio-Rad), which were conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. Immune complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence, and the size of proteins was estimated by prestained molecular weight standards. Immunoreactive bands obtained by enhanced chemiluminescence were quantified by densitometry. Membranes were reused for blotting after neutralization with 15% H2O2 or stripping at 50 °C (according to procedure from Amersham, Pharmacia Biotech). We examined the effect of taurocholate, colchicine, and wortmannin on the trafficking of intrinsic canalicular membrane proteins, including ATP-dependent transporters (mdr, spgp, and mrp2) and a nontransporter adhesion molecule (cCAM 105). Antibodies to mdr1, mdr2, and spgp (C219); spgp (K12); mrp2 (EAG15); and cCAM 105 (Ab65) were used to determine the specific content of the respective proteins in SMVs and CMVs. Anti-p85 antibody was used to quantitate distribution of the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase. As shown in Fig. 1, in control animals, mdr, spgp, and mrp2 were expressed exclusively in CMVs; p85 and cCAM 105 were present in both fractions. Intravenous injection of taurocholate produced maximal secretion of taurocholate in bile and significantly increased the level of each protein in its respective plasma membrane fraction. To determine whether accumulation of these proteins in vesicular fractions requires microtubule-mediated transport, we repeated the studies in rats that were pretreated with colchicine. Colchicine decreased taurocholate-induced accumulation of all proteins examined in CMVs; however, p85 and cCAM 105 levels remained elevated in SMVs. These results indicate that intracellular trafficking and recruitment of canalicular ATP-dependent transporters and cCAM 105 differ in response to taurocholate administration. Because taurocholate administration resulted in accumulation of PI 3-kinase p85 in both vesicular preparations, we determined whether these results correlated with enzymatic activities. The basal activity of PI 3-kinase was greater in SMV than in CMV fractions (3.6 ± 1.3 versus 2.2 ± 0.4 pmol PIP3/mg/min). Taurocholate administration increased PI 3-kinase activity in SMVs and CMVs (Fig. 2), similar to its effects on protein levels (Fig. 1). A direct effect on PI 3-kinase was excluded by observing that enzyme activity in whole cell lysates and anti-p85 immunoprecipitates was unaffected by incubation in 10–100 μm taurocholate or colchicine (data not shown). Pretreatment with colchicine blocked taurocholate-induced increased activity of PI 3-kinase in CMVs (Fig. 2). In SMVs, colchicine increased PI 3-kinase activity 6.4-fold above basal values and 2-fold above taurocholate-induced activity (Fig. 2). Whether or not taurocholate-induced activation of PI 3-kinase has physiological significance was studied using wortmannin, which, at the dose used, is a specific inhibitor of PI 3-kinase. The effect of wortmannin on taurocholate uptake and bile acid secretion was determined in isolated perfused rat liver. Taurocholate administration stimulated bile acid secretion, which was maximal after 20 min of perfusion and maintained for up to 60 min. Addition of wortmannin after taurocholate reduced bile acid secretion by 50% within 5 min (Fig. 3 A). Plasma levels of taurocholate were unaffected (data not shown), indicating that wortmannin did not alter taurocholate uptake but rapidly reduced bile acid secretion. When the sequence of administration was reversed (i.e. wortmannin was administered before taurocholate), bile acid secretion did not increase as much in response to taurocholate (Fig. 3 B), which indicates that PI 3-kinase activity is required for taurocholate-induced bile acid secretion. To determine the role of PI 3-kinase in the regulation of taurocholate-induced bile acid secretion, we quantified the effect of wortmannin in isolated perfused rat liver on PI 3-kinase activity in SMVs and CMVs and on trafficking of the bile canalicular ATP-dependent transporters and cCAM 105. PI 3-kinase activity in CMVs and SMVs from control and treated perfused liver is presented in Fig. 4. Taurocholate administration increased PI 3-kinase activity 2- and 4-fold in CMVs and SMVs, respectively, which was similar to effects observed in the same fractions from rats treated in vivo (Fig. 2). Wortmannin administration after pretreatment with taurocholate inhibited PI 3-kinase activity in both vesicular fractions. Similar data were obtained when wortmannin administration preceded taurocholate (data not shown). These studies reveal that wortmannin inhibits taurocholate-induced PI 3-kinase activity in SMVs and CMVs obtained from isolated perfused rat liver. As shown in Fig. 5, similar to effects observed in experiments in which taurocholate was administered intravenously, taurocholate-perfused liver showed an increase in p85, cCAM 105, spgp, mdr, and mrp2 protein levels in CMVs and increase in p85 and cCAM 105 in SMVs. Administration of wortmannin 30 min after the initial treatment with taurocholate reduced taurocholate-induced accumulation of p85 and cCAM proteins in CMVs and SMVs. Taurocholate-induced protein levels of ATP-dependent transporters in CMVs were decreased by wortmannin only when it was administered before taurocholate. However, protein levels of the transporters were not altered if wortmannin was infused after taurocholate (Fig. 5). The objective of the present study was to determine the role of PI 3-kinase in bile acid transport and secretion and in intracellular trafficking of bile canalicular ATP-dependent membrane transporters and cCAM 105, a membrane-associated protein that, under basal conditions, undergoes microtubule-dependent transcytosis. PI 3-kinase activity, canalicular ATP-dependent transporters, and cCAM 105 protein levels were analyzed in various experimental conditions. This is the first study that examines these processes in basolateral and canalicular membrane domains of the hepatocyte. Several isomers of type 1 PI 3-kinase (p110α, β, and δ) have been identified and are regulated by interaction with p85 α or β regulatory subunits (38Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). The p110γ PI 3-kinase activation is mediated by direct interaction with G-type receptors and does not require p85 (38Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Panayotou G. Waterfield M.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 267-272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (831) Google Scholar). Because diverse mechanisms of activation of PI 3-kinase isoforms produce higher phosphorylated forms of 3′-polyphosphoinositides, we measured total PI 3-kinase activity in vesicular fractions and compared these results with the content of p85 regulatory subunit in the same fractions. Although PI 3-kinase activity and p85 are mainly cytosolic, a fraction of the protein and activity are membrane-associated (37Susa M. Keeler M. Varticovski L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22951-22956Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and were detected in CMV and SMV fractions. In contrast, ATP-dependent transporters were found only in CMVs and were never detected in SMVs. After administration of taurocholate, the levels of all proteins studied and PI 3-kinase activity were increased in the respective plasma membrane fractions. Because the increased activity of PI 3-kinase paralleled accumulation of p85, cCAM 105, and ATP-dependent transporter proteins, the results suggest that taurocholate enhances mobilization of each of these proteins to their respective membrane domains. As shown in Fig. 1 B, taurocholate administration increased spgp to a degree greater than the increase in mdr. Because C219 recognizes spgp, mdr1, and mdr2, one might consider that spgp accounts for the C219 results without any effect on the translocation of mdr1 and mdr2; however, this is not the case. Previously, we demonstrated that ATP-dependent canalicular transport of daunomycin (an mdr1 function) and translocation of phosphatidylcholine (an mdr2 function) were similarly increased after taurocholate administration (21Gatmaitan Z.C. Nies A.T. Arias I.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1041-G1049PubMed Google Scholar). Taurocholate increased the canalicular content and function of each of the mdr protein family members (mdr1, mdr2, and spgp) (21Gatmaitan Z.C. Nies A.T. Arias I.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: G1041-G1049PubMed Google Scholar). Disruption of the microtubular apparatus by colchicine had differential effects on taurocholate-induced accumulation of PI 3-kinase activity and protein levels in CMVs and SMVs. In CMVs, colchicine inhibited taurocholate-induced increase in PI 3-kinase activity, which suggests that taurocholate increases microtubule-dependent trafficking of PI 3-kinase to the canalicular membrane. All taurocholate-induced accumulation of transporter proteins was down-regulated after colchicine treatment in CMVs, whereas in SMVs, cCAM 105 and p85 levels remained elevated. In addition, taurocholate-induced PI 3-kinase activity in SMVs was further increased after colchicine administration, indicating that PI 3-kinase participates in transcytotic vesicular transport of taurocholate and that taurocholate-mediated accumulation of ATP-dependent transporters and PI 3-kinase in CMVs requires the transcytotic pathway. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that PI 3-kinase is associated with intracellular vesicles that are transcytosed from the basolateral to the canalicular plasma membrane together with other membrane-associated molecules, such as cCAM 105 (23Bartles J.R. Feracci H.M. Stieger B. Hubbard A.L. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 1241-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar). This is the first evidence that PI 3-kinase is transported by a microtubular apparatus, although association of PI 3-kinase with microtubular filaments has been previously reported in platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated fibroblasts (39Kapeller R. Chakrabarti R. Cantley L. Fay F. Corvera S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6052-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Colchicine-induced microtubular disruption retards the transcytotic vesicular pathway and transfer of ecto-enzymes and cCAM 105 to the canalicular membrane, resulting in their accumulation in the basolateral domain. Although the level of p85 was unchanged in SMVs, PI 3-kinase activity significantly increased in SMVs after colchicine treatment. Other isoforms of PI 3-kinase, which are not detectable by the used antibodies, may also accumulate in sinusoidal membranes and contribute to the observed increase in enzymatic activities. Because systemic administration of wortmannin, a specific PI 3-kinase inhibitor at 50–100 nm could affect other organs, we used the isolated perfused liver technique for subsequent studies. Administration of taurocholate had similar effects on accumulation of proteins and PI 3-kinase in vesicular fractions whether it was given systemically or by perfusion of an isolated liver. As expected, taurocholate-enhanced bile acid secretion was reduced to 50% by subsequent perfusion with 100 nm wortmannin; however, taurocholate-induced accumulation in CMVs of canalicular ATP-dependent transporters was unaffected, indicating that transporter recruitment to the canalicular membrane is not affected if the inhibitor is administered after taurocholate. In contrast, when wortmannin was administered prior to taurocholate infusion, bile acid secretion and canalicular accumulation of ATP-dependent transporters were profoundly reduced. These results suggest that a major component of taurocholate-induced bile acid secretion and recruitment of transporters to the canalicular membrane are PI 3-kinase-dependent. In addition, other isoforms of PI 3-kinase, which are resistant to low concentrations of wortmannin, may also participate in the regulation of bile acid secretion. Our results are consistent with previous reports suggesting that PI 3-kinase is involved in vesicular trafficking and bile formation (40Folli F. Alvaro D. Gigliozzi A. Bassotti C. Kahn C.R. Pontiroli A.E. Capocaccia L. Jezequel A.M. Benedetti A. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 954-965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 41Noe B. Schliess F. Wettstein M. Heinrich S. Haussinger D. Gastroenterology. 1996; 110: 858-865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Despite significant taurocholate-induced accumulation of ATP-dependent transporters in CMVs, we did not detect these proteins in SMVs at any time, which suggests that transporter-containing vesicles associate with the bile canalicular membrane without undergoing transcytosis from the basolateral plasma membrane. How and where this association occurs remains to be determined. Both nontranscytotic delivery of ATP-dependent transporters to the canalicular membrane and transcytotic trafficking of cCAM 105 require PI 3-kinase activity Wortmannin also inhibited accumulation of PI 3-kinase protein, which suggests that PI 3-kinase is required for trafficking of itself. These studies prompt revision of current hypotheses regarding mechanisms of bile acid transport in the hepatocyte, recruitment of canalicular ATP-dependent transporters, and intracellular trafficking patterns for canalicular intrinsic membrane proteins. The dependence of these processes on specific downstream products of PI 3-kinase is the subject of our further studies."

This subunit has a two-domain structure with an N-terminal 10-stranded β sandwich and a C-terminal antiparallel two α-helix hairpin, as described previously (Wilkens, S., Dahlquist, F. W., McIntosh, L. P., Donaldson, L. W., and Capaldi, R. A. (1995) Nat. Struct. Biol. 2, 961–967). New data show that the two domains interact in solution in an interface formed by β strand 7 and the very C-terminal α-helix. This interface involves only hydrophobic interactions. The dynamics of the ε subunit in solution were examined. The two domains are relatively tightly associated with little or no flexibility relative to one another. The ε subunit can exist in two states in the ECF1F0 complex depending on whether ATP or ADP occupies catalytic sites. Proteolysis of the ε subunit in solution and when bound to the core F1 complex indicates that the conformation of the polypeptide in solution closely resembles the conformation of ε when bound to the F1 in the ADP state. Chemical and photo-cross-linking show that the ε subunit spans and interacts with two β subunits in the ADP state.

An F1F0-type ATP synthase is found in the inner mitochondrial membrane, the inner membrane of bacteria, and the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts where it functions to convert the free energy of the proton motive force into the chemical energy source ATP (for recent reviews see Refs. 1Capaldi R.A.

This large enzyme complex is composed of two major parts, a water-soluble F1 made of three α, three β, and one copy of each of the γ, δ, and ε subunit; and a membrane-embedded F0 consisting of 1a, 2 b, and 9–12 csubunits. The overall molecular weight of the complex is 520,000. There are three catalytic nucleotide binding sites located on the β subunits of the F1 and one proton channel formed by thea and c subunits in the membrane-embedded F0. The two parts of the complex are linked by two 45-Å stalks, a central one formed by the ε and part of the γ subunit and a peripheral one, constituted by the hydrophilic portions of the two bsubunits of the F0 and the δ subunit of the F1 (4Gogol E.P. Lücken U. Capaldi R.A. FEBS Lett. 1987; 219: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 5Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Nature. 1998; 393: 29Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The function of the central stalk is to transmit energy between the proton channel in the membrane and the catalytic nucleotide binding sites on the β subunits via conformational changes in the stalk-forming proteins. The peripherally located second stalk functions as a “stator” or “scaffold” to form a rigid link between the catalytic domain and the a subunit of the F0 with respect to a mobile domain formed by the γ, ε, and c subunit ring (6Ogilvie I. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16652-16656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 7Wilkens S. Dunn S.D. Chandler J. Dahlquist F.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 198-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The 2.8-Å crystal structure of the mitochondrial F1provides a molecular picture of the α and β subunits and part of the γ subunit (8Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2714) Google Scholar). The α and β subunits are arranged alternatingly in a hexagon around a central cavity in which the N and C termini of the γ subunit are located. Unfortunately, part of the γ subunit and the entire ε subunit (Escherichia colinomenclature), although present, were not resolved in the crystal structure, probably because they were disordered. Structural features of the N- and C-terminal domains of the ε subunit have been obtained in this laboratory by NMR spectroscopy (9Wilkens S. Dahlquist F.W. McIntosh L.P. Donaldson L.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). These data show that the N-terminal domain of the subunit is folded in a 10-stranded β sandwich, and the C-terminal third of the protein is arranged in an antiparallel two α-helix hairpin. A possible arrangement of the two domains with respect to one another was suggested based on spin labeling experiments and on a small number of long range NOEs1 between the two domains. However, because all structure calculations had been performed for the two domains independently, the proposed interaction site between the two domains remained speculative. While the work described here was in progress, a crystal structure of the E. coli ε subunit at 2.8 Å was obtained (10Uhlin U. Cox G.B. Guss J.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 1219-1230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar), which confirmed the domain structure seen in NMR and provided new information on the interaction of the two domains. To establish that the arrangement of the two domains relative to one another was not an artifact of the crystallization, we have completed the structure determination of the ε subunit in solution by NMR. The dynamics of the polypeptide have been investigated. In the intact ECF1 and ECF1F0, the ε subunit exists in at least two arrangements (11Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10987-10991Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Proteolysis studies show that in solution the ε is in the same conformation as when ADP is present on the enzyme. Wild type ECF1, ECF1 from mutant strain εM138C, and an overexpressed ε subunit were isolated as described (13Gogol E.P. Aggeler R. Sagermann M. Capaldi R.A.

Microbiol. 1992; 4: 1941-1946Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar). NMR spectroscopy and data analysis were performed essentially as described previously (9Wilkens S. Dahlquist F.W. McIntosh L.P. Donaldson L.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A total of 1321 experimental restraints have been collected for the full-length polypeptide, including 1212 NOE distance restraints, 30 hydrogen bond distance restraints, and 79 dihedral angle restraints. NOE intensities were sorted visually into the three classes: strong (1.8–3 Å), medium (1.8–4 Å), and weak (1.8–5.5 Å). Hydrogen bonds were only added when the accepting oxygens were unambiguously determined from structure calculations without or with only a subset of hydrogen bonds. Structure calculations were performed with the program X-PLOR (15Brünger A. X-PLOR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1993Google Scholar) according to standard protocols. A template with ideal local geometry was created based on standard bond length and angles. This template was then used to calculate a starting set of 30 embedded structures using distance geometry. The 30 structures were regularized and repeatedly refined by using simulated annealing and molecular dynamics protocols until stable. All 30 structures converged to give the same fold with 3 structures having NOE violations greater than 0.5 Å. All 30 structures were averaged, and the average was energy minimized to satisfy standard bond lengths and angles. 15N relaxation parameters were measured based on the inverse detection scheme from a series of two-dimensional spectra (16Kay L.E.

ECF1 and an isolated ε subunit were cleaved with trypsin at a ratio of 1:2000 for ECF1 and 1:80 for the ε subunit protease to protein (w/w) in 50 mm MOPS/Cl, pH 7, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mm EDTA at a protein concentration of 2.5 and 0.1 mg/ml, respectively. Proteolysis was stopped by the addition of 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (from a 200 mm stock solution in ethanol). Proteolysis was either carried out in the presence of 2 mm ATP + 0.5 mm EDTA or after turnover of 2 mm ATP in the presence of 2.5 mm MgCl2 + 0.5 mmEDTA. The rate of proteolysis for the isolated ε subunit was identical under both nucleotide conditions. Cleavage products were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 10–18% gradient gels. ECF1 containing the mutation εM138C (20Tang C. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol.

The enzyme at a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml was reacted with either TFPAM-3 (21Aggeler R. Chicas-Cruz K. Cai S.X. Keana J.F. Capaldi R.A.

Excess reagent was removed by one spin column in 50 mm Tris/Cl. The enzyme was converted to the ADP state before cross-linking by the addition of 2 mm ATP and 2.5 mm MgCl2. Half of the photolyzed sample was treated with 0.5 mm EDC as described above. Finally, all three samples (EDC-treated, photolyzed, and photolyzed and EDC-treated) were reacted with 0.8 mm NbfCl followed by one spin column to remove excess NbfCl. Cross-linked and labeled products were analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described above. The composition of cross-linked bands was analyzed by monoclonal antibody blots as described (23Aggeler R. Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10387-10393Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Previously, we determined the global fold of the ε subunit from NMR spectroscopy (9Wilkens S. Dahlquist F.W. McIntosh L.P. Donaldson L.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). This showed that the N-terminal two-thirds of the protein is folded in a 10-stranded β sandwich with the C-terminal third as an antiparallel two α-helix hairpin. The solution structure of the full 138-residue ε subunit, which uses a total of 1321 experimental restraints of which 822 are within the N-terminal 10-stranded β sandwich and 499 within the C-terminal two α-helix hairpin, has now been completed. Fig. 1 shows a1H-15N correlation spectrum of a uniformly15N-labeled ε subunit. Resonances of residues in the N-terminal β sandwich are labeled in black, whereas amides in the C-terminal α-helical domain are in red. The ε subunit has the tendency to aggregate in solution at concentrations higher than 1 mm and at pH values below 7.4. The relatively high pH needed for the solution structure determination leads to solvent exchange broadening of backbone amide resonances from residues Ser17, Ser28, Gly37, Ala39, Ile50, His56, Gly74, Glu91, Ser108, His109, and Gly110. All these residues are either in turn or loop positions or at the beginning of secondary structure elements throughout the structure. Fig. 2 a shows the minimized average of all 30 structures, and a summary of the NMR analysis is given in Table I. The dimensions of the ε subunit are approximately 30 × 25 × 17 Å for the N-terminal β sandwich and 45 × 18 × 15 Å for the C-terminal antiparallel two α-helix hairpin. A tentative orientation of the two domains with respect to each other was inferred previously from line broadening of amide resonances of residues between Ala124 and Lys130 caused by a nitroxide spin label introduced into the β domain at position 10, as well as from a limited number of long range NOEs between the C- and N-terminal domains (9Wilkens S.

The NMR data here define the interface between the N- and C-terminal domain by 30 long range NOEs involving the side chains of 12 residues, 5 from the N-terminal domain (Gly48, Phe61, Tyr63, Gly86, and Gln87) and 7 from the C-terminal α-helix (Ala126, Gln127, Val130, Ile131, Leu133, Thr134, and Ala137). This interface is shown in Fig. 2 b. The two domains are held together entirely by hydrophobic contacts, as there is no indication of any hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, or other polar interactions. Less well defined is the interaction between the two C-terminal α-helices themselves. Only a few (17Clore G.M. Driscoll P.C. Wingfield P.T. Gronenborn A.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7387-7401Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) long range NOEs could be identified because of the overlap of chemical shift values for the interacting protons. These are between the side chains of residues 91, 92, 94, 95, 98, 102, and 105 of the first helix and residues 131, 128, 125, 121, and 114 of the second helix. As reported previously, the backbone amide protons in the two C-terminal α-helices are undetectable in D2O buffer because of rapid exchange with solvent D2O (9Wilkens S. Dahlquist F.W. McIntosh L.P. Donaldson L.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). However, amide protons of most of the residues in the α-helices can be detected in D2O at pD values lower than 7.4 (data not shown). NMR allows examination of the dynamics of a protein and, in the case of ε, the flexibility of the two domains with respect to one another. A first indication that the N- and C-terminal domains of ε are in tight contact in the solution structure is the observation that there are at least 30 resolved long range NOEs between residues of the N- and C-terminal domains (see above). On average, these have the same intensity (not decreased) compared with other long range NOEs within the N-terminal domain (not shown). To examine the flexibility of the two domains with respect to one another in more detail, a backbone15N{1H} NOE spectrum was recorded, and the backbone relaxation parameters were measured. A15N{1H} NOE spectrum of the ε subunit is shown in Fig. 3. Despite the fact that some of the peaks are weakened because of the solvent exchange (the same ones that are weak in amide correlation spectra recorded at pH 7.4, see above), all of the peaks, including the ones of residues in the linker region and the interface, have a positive intensity, consistent with the ε subunit tumbling as one entity in solution. Fig. 4 shows a summary of the measured relaxation parameters for a total of 100 of the 138 residues. The average T 1 and T 2 times for the ε subunit backbone amides are 571 ± 27 ms (residues 3–136, excluding residues 14, 17, 39, 74, and 107 because of their large errors) and 65 ± 3 ms, respectively.Figure 4Backbone 15N relaxation parameters of the ε subunit. Top, T 1 and T 2 times;bottom, calculatedT 1/T 2 ratio. For details, see text.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The measured T 1 and T 2relaxation parameters shown in Fig. 4 provide no evidence of a flexible linker connecting the two domains in ε. Only Leu89 shows a somewhat larger than average T 1, which is not uncommon for a turn position. Moreover, residues involved in the interface between the two domains (Gly48, Phe61, Tyr63, Gly86, Gln87, Ala126, Gln127, Val130, Ile131, Leu133, Thr134, and Ala137) show none of the unusual relaxation behavior expected for residues undergoing conformational exchange. Thus, any such conformational change must be faster than 10−3–10−4 s or slower than theT 2 relaxation time above. Previous experiments from this laboratory showed that the ε subunit can adopt at least two conformations, when bound to ECF1 (11Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) or in ECF1F0 (12Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10987-10991Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), depending on whether the enzyme is in the ATP form (e.g.ATP/EDTA or AMP-PNP+Mg2+) or in the ADP state (ADP/Mg/Pi present). For example, the rate with which trypsin cleaves the ε subunit is different whether ADP or ATP is in catalytic sites, with the ADP form of ε being more resistant to protease attack (11Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This difference in rates of cleavage of ε under the two conditions is clearly evident in the experiment shown in Fig. 5. With ECF1 in ATP (lanes 2–5), the first cleavage product observed runs above and subsequent products run below the unmodified ε subunit. In the presence of ADP (lanes 7–10), the rate of cleavage of ε is much slower under otherwise identical proteolysis conditions (see also Ref. 11Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Lanes 11–15 of Fig. 5 show the cleavage pattern of the isolated ε subunit in the presence of much higher levels of trypsin than used for ECF1. Similar to the ε subunit bound to ECF1 with ADP in catalytic sites, there is only very slow cleavage of the polypeptide. The various cleavage sites obtained after prolonged trypsin treatment of the isolated ε subunit were determined from mass spectrometric analysis. Peptides with molecular weights for residues 1–123, 1–100, 1–99, 1–98, and 1–93 were generated sequentially in time course experiments. These are the same cleavage products found by trypsin treatment of ε in ECF1 in the presence of either ATP or ADP. It is the rate of the cleavage, not the site of cleavage, which varies under different nucleotide conditions in ECF1. These sites are in both α-helices of the C-terminal domain. The different nucleotide conditions had no effect on cleavage rates in isolated ε subunit (results not shown). The orientation of the N-terminal β sandwich domain in the ATP synthase complex is well defined based on a large number of chemical and photo-cross-linking results (20Tang C. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3018-3024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 22Aggeler R. Weinreich F. Capaldi R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1230: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Aggeler R. Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1994; 269: 10221-10224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From these data, interfaces to the γ subunit of the F1 and to thec subunit oligomer of the F0 could be identified, involving one face and the bottom of the β sandwich, respectively. Several cross-linking studies have shown that there is binding of the ε subunit to α and β subunits and that this is through the C-terminal α-helix-loop-α-helix domain. For example, cross-linking can be induced between a β and ε subunit by the water-soluble carbodiimide EDC (26Lötscher H.R. deJong C. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 28: 4134-4140Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar), a cross-link subsequently shown to involve Glu381 of β and one of three Ser residues (106–108) in ε (27Dallmann H.G. Flynn T.G. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18953-18960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cross-linking from α or β to ε can also be obtained by replacing Glu381 of β (24Aggeler R. Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9185-9191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) or Ser411 of α (28Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13888-13891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) along with Ser108 of ε with Cys residues. Finally, a Cys replacing the C-terminal residue Met138 of ε can be cross-linked to a β subunit when modified with the photoactivatable cross-linker TFPAM-3 (20Tang C. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3018-3024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). As Ser108 and Met138are at the opposite ends of the helix-loop-helix region of ε, it seems likely that this subunit spans two β subunits. To test this possibility, cross-linking from the two sites was performed sequentially using ECF1 from the mutant εM138C. As shown in Fig. 6, EDC reaction, or photoactivation after TFPAM-3 modification of Cys138 alone, gave a major cross-linked product of M r(app). 70,000. In contrast, when both reactions were performed sequentially, a significant amount of cross-linked product of M r(app). 130,000 was produced. This large product must contain ε cross-linked to two β subunits,i.e. it is a β-ε-β adduct. The presence of ε and β in the 130,000 cross-link product was confirmed by monoclonal antibodies (results not shown). In one set of experiments, ECF1 from the mutant εM138C was modified with NbfCl after the cross-linking reaction (29Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1276: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). No fluorescence because of bound NbfCl was observed in the β-ε cross-link generated with either EDC or via photo-cross-linking from the Cys at position 138. However, bound reagent was readily apparent in a noncross-linked β subunit (not shown). The 2.8-Å crystal structure of a major part of the F1from beef heart mitochondria has provided important insight into cooperative catalysis by ATP synthases (8Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2714) Google Scholar). However, to fully understand energy coupling within this enzyme, it will almost certainly be necessary to obtain a high resolution structure of the entire complex. The lack of any high resolution structural data for the stalk region and membrane-bound F0 makes it particularly difficult to establish the molecular mechanism for the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to proton translocation. We have been examining individual purified subunits of the stalk region to study their structure and interaction. Previously, we obtained structural models of the N- and C-terminal domains of the ε subunit from NMR spectroscopy (9Wilkens S. Dahlquist F.W. McIntosh L.P. Donaldson L.W. Capaldi R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 961-967Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the solution structure of the entire polypeptide, which adds important information on the interaction sites between the two domains, and the dynamics of the molecule as a whole. The interaction between the two domains involves side chains from β strand 7 of the N-terminal domain and one face of the very C-terminal α-helix. No interactions were observed between the first C-terminal α-helix (residues 91–106) and the N-terminal domain. Recently, the crystal structure of the E. coli ε subunit has been determined at 2.3-Å resolution (10Uhlin U. Cox G.B. Guss J.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 1219-1230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This crystal structure confirmed our previously determined structures of the two domains and also showed a tight interaction of the N- and C-terminal domains mainly via hydrophobic residues. The tight interaction between the two domains of ε seen in the crystal structure determination could have been enforced by the crystal packing. The fact that the same interaction is now seen by NMR adds confidence to it being a preferred conformation of the polypeptide. In conjunction with the NMR structure determination, we have been examining the interactions of the ε subunit with other subunits of ECF1F0 by cross-linking experiments. Here, we extend these studies and show that the C-terminal domain of the ε subunit binds in such a way as to span two β subunits, with the region around Ser108 interacting with one and Met138 being close to the other. The distance between Ser108 and Met138 from the structure shown in Fig. 2 is approximately 40 Å and, therefore, sufficient to interact with two β subunits at the same time. It is clear from the x-ray structure of MF1 (8Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2714) Google Scholar), as well as from biochemical studies, that the three β subunits are in different conformations that appear to be determined by nucleotide binding and by the interaction with the small subunits. In the crystal structure, one β subunit has AMP-PNP bound (called βTP), a second β subunit has ADP bound (βDP), and the third β subunit is empty (βE). From cross-linking studies, we have defined the three β subunits as follows: βγ is the β subunit in which a Cys at position 381 (in the DELSEED region) can be cross-linked to an intrinsic Cys (Cys87) of the γ subunit; βε is the β subunit in which Cys381 cross-links to εCys108; βfree is the β subunit that is not cross-linked to either γ or ε (24Aggeler R. Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 9185-9191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 29Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1276: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). From the crystal structure, βγ is equivalent to βTP. Labeling studies have shown that NbfCl preferentially binds to βfree (29Haughton M.A. Capaldi R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1276: 154-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), which is equivalent to β-E based on a crystal structure of the mitochondrial enzyme reacted with NbfCl. 2J. E. Walker, personal communication. In the experiments reported here, NbfCl labeled free β subunit but not β subunits involved in the β-ε cross-link products (β-ε via 108 or 138 and β-ε-β). Therefore, the β subunit εMet138 is close to must be βγ(βTP), whereas the β subunit cross-linking to ε via position 108 has to be βDP. In summary, the ε subunit spans between βTP and βDP. The ε subunit can exist in at least two different conformations when bound to the core F1 complex (11Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 12Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10987-10991Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 30Capaldi R.A. Aggeler R. Wilkens S. Grüber G. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 397-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). With ADP/Mg/Pi present, ε is less sensitive to proteolytic degradation compared with the “active” state of the complex, when ATP is in catalytic sites. The structure described here and in Uhlinet al. (10Uhlin U. Cox G.B. Guss J.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 1219-1230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) appears to be the ADP state, based on trypsin cleavage studies. On ATP binding to F1, protease digestion at several sites in the C-terminal domain is facilitated, and these sites are in both α-helices and the backbone within the region of interaction with the N-terminal domain. This can only happen if the helical hairpin comes off its binding site on the β subunits and the N-terminal β sandwich and unfolds to allow the trypsin cleavage. The release of ε from interaction with α and β subunits on ATP binding is evident in the loss of the EDC-induced cross-link between εSer108 and the DELSEED region in βDP (11Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), as well as of the photochemical cross-link from εM138C to βTP (20Tang C. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3018-3024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) on reaction with ATP + EDTA or AMP-PNP + Mg2+. Based on the NMR data, the interaction between the two domains of the ε subunit appears strong, with an isolated ε subunit behaving as a rigid molecule in solution. Protease digestion studies of the isolated ε subunit show that separations of the two domains by disruption of the interface between the two is not favored but does occur (rate much slower than T 2; see “Results”). The implication is that ATP binding and the consequent conformational changes in β subunits generate an energetically unstable arrangement of the ε subunit. It is now generally accepted that the coupling between the proton channel and catalytic sites is accompanied by a three-stepped rotation of a domain formed by the γ (31Gogol E.P. Johnson E.

Chem. 1997; 272: 19621-19624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and it is further assumed that a ring of 12 c subunits in the F0 is also part of the rotating unit (36Watts S.D. Tang C. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28341-28347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 37Junge W. Lill H. Engelbrecht S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 420-423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). In previous studies, we showed that dicyclohexylcarbodiimide inhibition of the F1F0 ATP synthase can lock ε in either the ADP or ATP state, depending on whether the carbodiimide reaction took place with ADP or ATP in catalytic sites (12Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10987-10991Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with the conformational switch in ε being coupled to a rotary motion of the γεc 9–12 domain and/or proton translocation. At the same time, there is evidence that the ε subunit in the ATP state resides preferentially at α subunits rather than attached to β subunits. This is seen in cross-linking studies (28Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13888-13891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and in electron microscopy studies (38Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1994; 375: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, a cysteine at position 108 in the ε subunit cross-links preferentially to the α subunit when going from the ADP to the ATP state, and a gold particle bound to the ε subunit at position 38 can be seen superimposed on either an α (ADP form) or a β subunit (ATP form). Taken together, our data suggest that the rotation of the γεc domain in the intact F1F0 ATP synthase requires conformational rearrangements of the ε subunit in each step. The possibility that rotation is six-stepped, rather than three-stepped, warrants further study. We thank Frederick W. Dahlquist for providing the NMR hardware and software and for constant support and advice throughout this project. We also thank Dr. Hong-Jun Zhou for the peak-search and fitting programs, Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2062616640,"Protein-tyrosine phosphatases can exhibit stringent substrate specificity in vivo, although the molecular basis for this is not well understood. The three-dimensional structure of the catalytically inactive protein-tyrosine phosphate 1B (PTP1B)/C215S complexed with an optimal substrate, DADEpYL-NH2, reveals specific interactions between amino acid residues in the substrate and PTP1B. The goal of this work is to rigorously evaluate the functional significance of Tyr46, Arg47, Asp48, Phe182, and Gln262 in substrate binding and catalysis, using site-directed mutagenesis. Combined with structural information, kinetic analysis of the wild type and mutant PTP1B usingp-nitrophenyl phosphate and phosphotyrosine-containing peptides has yielded further insight into PTP1B residues, which recognize general features, as well as specific properties, in peptide substrates. In addition, the kinetic results suggest roles of these residues in E-P hydrolysis, which are not obvious from the structure of PTP1B/peptide complex. Thus, Tyr46 and Asp48recognize common features of peptide substrates and are important for peptide substrate binding and/or E-P formation. Arg47 acts as a determinant of substrate specificity and is responsible for the modest preference of PTP1B for acidic residues NH2-terminal to phosphotyrosine. Phe182 and the invariant Gln262 are not only important for substrate binding and/or E-P formation but also important for the E-P hydrolysis step."

We have examined the interactions of the [4Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> Fe protein with nucleotides and its ability to transfer electrons to the MoFe protein. The [4Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> Fe protein binds both MgATP and MgADP and undergoes the MgATP induced conformational change and then binds properly to the MoFe protein, as evidenced by the fact that the behavior of the 0 and +1 oxidation states in the chelation and chelation protection assays are indistinguishable. Nucleotide binding does not effect the distinctive UV/Vis, CD, or Mössbauer spectra exhibited by the [4Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> Fe protein; however, because the intensity of the g=16.4 EPR signal of the [4Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> Fe protein is extremely sensitive to minor variations of the rhombicity parameter E/D, the EPR signal is sensitive to the binding of nucleotides. A 50:50 mixture of [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> and [4Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> Fe protein results in electron self-exchange and 100% production of [4Fe-4S]<sup>+</sup> Fe protein, demonstrating that the +1/0 couple is fully reversible. MgATP is absolutely required for electron transfer from the [4Fe-4S]<sup>0</sup> Fe protein to the reduced state of the MoFe protein. In that reaction both electrons are transferred and are used to reduce substrate."
https://openalex.org/W2024859597,"Nitric oxide (NO⋅) is a naturally occurring toxin that some organisms adaptively resist. In aerobic or anaerobic Escherichia coli, low levels of NO⋅exposure inactivated the NO⋅-sensitive citric acid cycle enzyme aconitase, and inactivation was more effective when the adaptive synthesis of NO⋅-defensive proteins was blocked with chloramphenicol. Protection of aconitase in aerobically grown E. coli was dependent upon O2, was potently inhibited by cyanide, and was correlated with an induced rate of cellular NO⋅consumption. Constitutive and adaptive cellular NO⋅ consumption in aerobic cells was also dependent upon O2 and inhibited by cyanide. Exposure of aerobic cells to NO⋅ accordingly elevated the activity of the O2-dependent and cyanide-sensitive NO⋅ dioxygenase (NOD). Anaerobic E. coli exposed to NO⋅ or nitrate induced a modest O2-independent and cyanide-resistant NO⋅-metabolizing activity and a more robust O2-stimulated cyanide-sensitive activity. The latter activity was attributed to NOD. The results support a role for NOD in the aerobic detoxification of NO⋅ and suggest functions for NOD and a cyanide-resistant NO⋅ scavenging activity in anaerobic cells.

E. coli does not appear to produce a typical NOR activity, but it does produce a multiheme nitrite reductase with NO⋅-reducing capacity (19Costa C. Macedo A. Moura I. Moura J.J.G. Le Gall J. Berlier Y. Liu M.-Y. Payne W.J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 276: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and a nitric oxide dioxygenase (NOD) that has been proposed to function in NO⋅detoxification (20Gardner P.R. Gardner A.M.

We have observed, and now report, an increased susceptibility to NO⋅ of the NO⋅-sensitive citric acid cycle enzyme aconitase (21Gardner P.R. Costantino G. Szabó C. Salzman A.L. J. Biol.

Protection of aconitase activity correlated with an increased rate of cellular NO⋅consumption and correlated with an increased NOD activity in cell-free extracts. The results support the proposed function of NOD in the constitutive and adaptive detoxification of NO⋅ in aerobicE. coli. The possible role of the NO⋅-induced NOD activity in anaerobic E. coli is discussed. E. coli strain DH5α was from Life Technologies, Inc. Mutants deficient in the terminal oxidases ECL936 (Δcyo), ECL937 (Δcyd), and the parent ECL933 were kindly provided by E. C. C. Lin (23Iucchi S. Chepuri V. Fu H.-A. Gennis R.B. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6020-6025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Compressed gas cylinders containing 1200 ppm (± 5%) NO⋅ in ultrapure N2, 99.998% N2, and 99.993% O2 were obtained from Praxair (Bethlehem, PA). NO⋅-saturated water was prepared by stirring N2-equilibrated water under 98.5% NO⋅ gas (Aldrich), which was first bubbled through 1 n NaOH. Saturated NO⋅ was stored at 4 °C in a rubber septum-sealed glass tube. Sodium cyanide, NADP+, FAD, chloramphenicol, glucose oxidase from Aspergillus niger, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase from bakers' yeast, sodium nitrite, sodium nitrate, succinic acid, d-glucose, glucose 6-phosphate,l-arginine-HCl, thiamine HCl, Tris, and MnCl2were from Sigma. Nitrate reductase from Aspergillus nigerand bovine liver catalase were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Tryptone and yeast extract were obtained from Difco. The minimal salts medium was made up with tap water and contained 60 mm K2HPO4, 33 mmKH2PO4, 7.6 mm(NH4)2SO4, 1.7 mmsodium citrate, 1 mm MgSO4, 10 μmMnCl2, 10 μg/ml thiamine Cl, 40 μg/mll-arginine, and 10 mm sodium succinate or 10 mm glucose as indicated. The phosphate-buffered LB medium was prepared with 10 g of tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, and 10 g of NaCl per liter of 66 mmK2HPO4, 33 mmKH2PO4, and 10 μmMnCl2. The pH of the phosphate-buffered LB and minimal salts media were adjusted to 7.0 with HCl or NaOH. MnCl2was routinely added to media to ensure full expression of the inducible O⨪2-scavenging manganese-containing superoxide dismutase, maximal activity of the O⨪2-sensitive aconitase, and thus optimal growth on citric acid cycle-dependent substrates (32Gardner P.R. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8757-8763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To achieve maximal gas exchange, cultures were routinely grown in a gyrorotary water bath shaking at >200 rpm at 37 °C with a medium:flask volume ratio of at most 1:5, and growth was monitored by following the turbidity at 550 nm. Bacterial densities were determined by dilution, plating, and colony counting. An absorbance of 1.0 at 550 nm corresponded to 7 × 108 bacteria/ml when bacteria were grown in the minimal medium. Anoxic growth of cultures was achieved by incubating cultures at 37 °C in static stopper-sealed 50-ml Erlenmeyer flasks filled with 50 ml of medium. To minimize the disturbance of head space gases, culture aliquots were removed from gas-equilibrated culture flasks using a 1-ml tuberculin syringe connected via small tubing. Culture aliquots were immediately transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes and were quickly centrifuged at 20,000 × g for 25 s, the supernatant was aspirated, and the cell pellet was frozen on dry ice. Cell pellets were resuspended and lysed by sonicating in 0.1 ml of buffer containing 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.4, 0.6 mm MnCl2, and 20 μm barium dl-fluorocitrate, and the lysate was frozen on dry ice. Cell lysates were stored at −70 °C for up to 2 weeks without noticeable loss of aconitase activity. Lysates were thawed in a 25 °C water bath and clarified by centrifugation for 25 s at 20,000 × g immediately prior to the assay of aconitase activity. Cell lysates were prepared for the assay of NOD activity essentially as described for the assay of aconitase except that the lysis buffer contained 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.8, and 0.1 mm EDTA. A three-way gas proportioner (Cole-Parmer Instrument Co.) was used to produce various mixtures of O2, N2, and NO⋅ at a constant flow rate of 30 ml/min, and gas mixtures were passed through a trap containing NaOH pellets to remove higher oxides of nitrogen. Aconitase activity and protein were assayed as described previously (21Gardner P.R. Costantino G. Szabó C. Salzman A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25071-25076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). For the measurement of media NO2− and NO3−, cultures were clarified by centrifugation, and supernatants were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h in a 0.1-ml reaction mixture containing 7 milliunits of nitrate reductase and 40 μm NADPH in 100 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5. Samples were assayed for NO2−with the Griess reagent (24Green L.C. Wagner D.A. Glogowski J. Skipper P.L. Wishnok J.S. Tannenbaum S.R. Anal. Biochem. 1982; 126: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (10881) Google Scholar) using sodium nitrite as a standard. NO⋅ consumption was measured at 37 °C with an NO⋅ microelectrode (Diamond General Inc.) fitted in a water-jacketed glass-stoppered 2-ml capacity cell (Gilson Inc.) equipped with a magnetic stirrer. One microliter of NO⋅ was delivered to the cell with a Hamilton syringe from a saturated solution (2 mm) prepared in water. Rates of NO⋅ consumption by bacteria were measured in minimal medium salts containing chloramphenicol and glucose or succinate as indicated. Rates of NO⋅ consumption were determined from initial rates and were corrected for the background rate of NO⋅ decomposition. O2 consumption was measured at 37 °C with a Clark-type O2 electrode (Yellow Springs Instrument Co.) in a water-jacketed cell in a total volume of 2.0 ml of minimal succinate medium. The O2 concentration for media saturated with air at normal atmospheric pressure and 37 °C was taken to be 200 μm (25Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1964; 90: 225-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Cell-free extracts were assayed for NOD activity at 37 °C in a 2-ml reaction mixture containing 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, 0.1 mmEDTA, 1 μm FAD, 0.2 mm NADP+, 0.5 units/ml glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 2.5 mm glucose 6-phosphate, and 1 μm NO⋅. Initial rates of NO⋅ disappearance from reaction mixtures were followed amperometrically with an NO⋅ electrode and were corrected for the background rate of NO⋅ decomposition. Where indicated, O2 was removed by incubating the mixture with 10 mm glucose, 2 units/ml glucose oxidase, and 130 units/ml catalase for 5 min prior to the addition of NO⋅ and extract. O2 removal was followed amperometrically with an O2 electrode. Results are representative of two or more independent experiments. We measured the effects of NO⋅ on the growth of E. coli in order to gauge the capacity of cells to adapt to NO⋅ under various growth conditions. Exposure of log phase cultures to an atmosphere containing 960 ppm NO⋅ had little effect on the aerobic growth of E. coli in either the minimal succinate or the rich LB medium (Fig. 1, A and B, comparelines 1 and 2). Similarly, 480 ppm NO⋅exerted no discernible effect on the anaerobic growth of E. coli in a minimal glucose medium supplemented with 10 mm nitrate (data not shown). Interestingly, however, NO⋅ exposure caused a small, but significant, decrease in the aerobic growth rate and the yield of E. coli in the LB medium at the end of the log phase (Fig. 1 B, comparelines 1 and 2). The effect of growth phase on NO⋅ inhibition was explored further. Exposure of late stationary phase E. coli to 960 ppm NO⋅ strongly inhibited growth (Fig. 1, C and D, compare lines 1 and 2), and the growth-inhibitory effects of NO⋅ were more pronounced in the LB medium (Fig. 1 D). Growth inhibition was readily reversible, as indicated by the ability of NO⋅-treated cells to resume normal growth following NO⋅ removal (Fig. 1, C and D, comparelines 2 and 3). The susceptibility of stationary phase cultures to NO⋅-mediated growth inhibition suggests a requirement for nutritional resources, protein synthesis, or growth competency for NO⋅ resistance. Moreover, the ability of cells to grow normally at NO⋅ levels that were previously shown to potently inactivate the citric acid cycle enzyme aconitase (21Gardner P.R. Costantino G. Szabó C. Salzman A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25071-25076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) suggests that NO⋅ resistance is due to the presence of adaptive mechanisms. The NO⋅-sensitive aconitase (21Gardner P.R. Costantino G. Szabó C. Salzman A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25071-25076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 22Kennedy M.C. Antholine W.E. Beinert H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20340-20347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) was used to explore the mechanism of adaptation of E. coli to NO⋅. Thus, we supposed that adaptation to NO⋅ should correlate with the protection of aconitase from inactivation. Indeed, aconitase activity was more sensitive to NO⋅ in the presence of the protein synthesis inhibitor chloramphenicol than in its absence (Fig. 2, compare lines 1 and 2). Further, NO⋅ was a more effective inactivator of aconitase in the absence of O2 than in its presence (Fig. 2, compare lines 2 and 4), and, interestingly, chloramphenicol had no apparent effect on the susceptibility of aconitase to NO⋅-mediated inactivation in the absence of O2 (Fig. 2, compare lines 3 and 4). The data clearly indicate inducible protective mechanisms for aconitase and demonstrate a role of O2 in the adaptive mechanism. We also measured the effects of chloramphenicol on NO⋅-mediated aconitase inactivation in anaerobic E. coli, since aerobic succinate-adapted E. coli are dependent upon O2for growth, respiration, and ATP production, which may have affected the ability of cells to adapt. Exposure of anaerobic glucose-adaptedE. coli to 240 ppm NO⋅ in N2 caused a greater decline of aconitase activity in the presence of chloramphenicol than in its absence (Fig. 3, compare lines 1 and 2). It is noteworthy that the inducible protection of aconitase was relatively less effective under anaerobic than aerobic conditions. Thus, a ∼20% loss of aconitase was observed following 60 min of 240 ppm NO⋅ exposure in anaerobic cultures (Fig. 3,line 1), whereas 480 ppm NO⋅ did not affect the aconitase activity in aerobic cultures (Fig. 2, line 1). Thus, anaerobic as well as aerobic E. coli protect aconitase from NO⋅-mediated inactivation. Moreover, while O2was not absolutely essential for adaptive protection, it did increase the apparent NO⋅ detoxification capacity of cells. We supposed that the decreased sensitivity of aconitase to NO⋅ in chloramphenicol-treated E. coliin the presence of O2 might be due, at least in part, to a lower exposure to NO⋅, since the O2-mediated oxidation of NO⋅ to form NO2·and N2O3 would be expected to decrease the steady-state NO⋅ levels and increase NO2− and NO3− formation (26Ignarro L.J. Fukuto J.M. Griscavage J.M. Rogers N.E. Byrns R.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8103-8107Crossref PubMed Scopus (759) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the O2-dependent protection may be due to an NO⋅ metabolic pathway, which was directly or indirectly dependent upon O2. For example, the protective effect of O2 may be linked to the respiration of E. coli.Thus, the homologous mitochondrial terminal oxidase, cytochromec oxidase, is thought to metabolize NO⋅ (27Borutaité V. Brown G.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar,28Cooper C.E. Torres J. Sharpe M.A. Wilson M.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). To evaluate the contribution of O2-mediated NO⋅oxidation to the protection, we measured the concentration of O2 required for aconitase protection in E. coliexposed to NO⋅ and compared it with that required for NO⋅oxidation as detected by the formation of NO2− and NO3− in the culture medium. Surprisingly, aconitase was near maximally protected from the inactivating effect of 240 ppm NO⋅ by the lowest O2concentration tested (∼17 μm O2) (Fig. 4, closed circles). However, at this O2 level, NO2− and NO3− formation was only a fraction of that achievable via NO⋅ autoxidation (Fig. 4, open circles). Thus, the O2-mediated decomposition of NO⋅ does not appear to account for the protective effects of O2. The role of respiration and the terminal respiratory oxidases in the O2-dependent protection of aconitase was assessed by measuring the effects of the inhibitor cyanide. The addition of cyanide (25 μm) to aerobic cultures completely blocked the protection of aconitase by O2 (Fig. 5 A, compare lines 1and 2), while cyanide was without effect in the absence of O2 (compare lines 3 and 4). Importantly, cyanide was effective at decreasing aconitase protection at much lower concentrations than those required for the inhibition of respiration. Thus, while ∼5 μm NaCN was saturating in its effect on the O2-dependent protection of aconitase (Fig. 5 B), half-maximal inhibition of respiration required >50 μm NaCN (Fig. 5 B, inset). The results clearly demonstrate a cyanide-sensitive mechanism of aconitase protection; however, the difference in cyanide sensitivities indicates a mechanism of inhibition independent of cell respiration and the terminal respiratory oxidases. We also investigated the effects of O2 and cyanide on the NO⋅ sensitivity of aconitase in naive aerobic cultures and compared these effects with those in NO⋅-treated cultures to determine whether the adaptive protection displayed a similar O2 dependence and cyanide sensitivity. Indeed, the induced protection of aconitase was O2-dependent; however, this protection appeared less sensitive to cyanide than the constitutive activity (Fig. 6). We were unable to test the effects of higher cyanide concentrations, because aconitase activity was sensitive to cyanide at >25 μm. This may be understandable in light of the ability of cyanide to stimulate O⨪2 production by respiring E. colimembranes (29Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19767-19777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the ability of O⨪2 to inactivate aconitase (30Gardner P.R. Biosci. Rep. 1997; 17: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). To determine whether aconitase protection in E. coli was associated with an increased rate of NO⋅metabolism, we measured the rate of NO⋅ consumption by aerobic and anaerobic cells. We also measured the effects of O2 and cyanide on these rates. As shown by the data in Fig. 7 A, aerobic E. coliconsumed NO⋅. Moreover, NO⋅ consumption was sensitive to cyanide and dependent upon O2. Further, NO⋅consumption was induced approximately 13-fold in aerobic cultures exposed to 480 ppm NO⋅ for 60 min (Fig. 7 B). The induced rate of NO⋅ consumption was also sensitive to cyanide and dependent upon O2. Control anaerobic cultures did not express an NO⋅ consumption activity, whereas anaerobic cells exposed to 960 ppm NO⋅ for 60 min produced an NO⋅-consuming activity that did not require O2 and that was insensitive to cyanide (Table I, Experiment A). Interestingly, however, the presence of O2in the assay revealed a cryptic NO⋅ consumption activity that was cyanide-sensitive and was also induced ∼12-fold by the NO⋅exposure. NO3− (10 mm) also induced an NO⋅-consuming activity in anoxic cultures with similar properties as that induced by gaseous NO⋅ (Table I, Experiment B).Table INO consumption by anaerobically grown E. coliTreatmentFinal growthWithout O2With O2Basal+ NaCNBasal+ NaCNA550nmol NO/min/10 cellsExpt.

Prompted by the aforementioned results, we identified an O2-dependent cyanide-sensitive NO⋅-converting activity in extracts of E. coli that was NOD/flavohemoglobin and has been described elsewhere (20Gardner P.R.

Further, we supposed that this NOD activity might account for the NO⋅inducible, cyanide-sensitive, and O2-dependent protection of aconitase and NO⋅ consumption by cells. As shown by the data in Table II, NOD activity in DH5α cells was induced ∼36-fold following an exposure to 960 ppm NO⋅. Extract NOD activity was dependent upon O2, was potently inhibited by cyanide, and displayed cofactor requirements consistent with the flavohemoglobin/NOD activity (20Gardner P.R. Gardner A.M.

NOD activity was also measured in anaerobic cultures exposed to NO⋅ or NO3− as described in the legend to Table I. NOD activity was increased 33-fold (588 milliunits/mgversus 18 milliunits/mg) following exposure to 960 ppm NO⋅ and 40-fold (644 milliunits/mg versus 16 milliunits/mg) during anoxic growth with NO3−. Thus, NO⋅-induced NOD activity levels correlate with the NO⋅-induced aconitase protection and NO⋅ consumption in both aerobic and anaerobic cells.Table IINO consumption by cell-free extracts of E. coliSampleAssaySpecific activityActivitynmol/min/mg%Air controlComplete5.8100NO·-exposedComplete209.5100− FAD2.3<2− NADP+2.4<2− G-6-P1.1<1− G-6-PD0.00− O27.1<4+ NaCN27.3<15NO· consumption activity was measured in extracts prepared from strain DH5α grown aerobically in minimal salts succinate medium to an A550 = ∼0.5.

Our results demonstrate aerobic and anaerobic pathways for NO⋅ detoxification that appear to differ from the NORs described in denitrifiers (11Dermastia M. Turk T. Hollocher T.C. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1989; 179: 683-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Foremost among these differences was the requirement for O2. Moreover, the similar NO⋅inducibility, O2 dependence, and cyanide sensitivity between the NOD activity in extracts (Table II) and the inducible and constitutive aconitase protection and NO⋅ consumption by intactE. coli strongly supports a role for the recently described NOD (20Gardner P.R. Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Salzman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10378-10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) in the observed aerobic NO⋅ removal and detoxification pathway. We can estimate that the NOD activity measured in cell extracts is within range of the NO⋅ consumption activity of intact aerobic E. coli. Thus, assuming roughly 10−13 g of soluble protein per E. coli, we can calculate the NOD activity in extracts from control and NO⋅-exposed E. coli to equal 0.1 and 2.1 nmol of NO⋅/min/108 cells, respectively. These values are comparable with the respective values of 0.2 and 3.2 measured for intact aerobic DH5α grown under similar conditions (Fig. 7). Furthermore, NO⋅ consumption by cells does not appear to involve the terminal respiratory oxidases as proposed for mitochondria (27Borutaité V. Brown G.C. Biochem. J. 1996; 315: 295-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar,28Cooper C.E. Torres J. Sharpe M.A. Wilson M.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar), since cyanide was without effect on the respiration of E. coli at levels that inhibited NO⋅ detoxification (Figs. 5and 7). Moreover, E. coli strains deficient in either of the terminal respiratory oxidases (23Iucchi S. Chepuri V. Fu H.-A. Gennis R.B. Lin E.C.C. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6020-6025Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) expressed normal levels of the constitutive and inducible aerobic NO⋅ consumption activity (data not shown), whereas NOD/flavohemoglobin-deficient E. coli express essentially no constitutive or inducible aerobic NO⋅ consumption activity (20Gardner P.R. Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Salzman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10378-10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The identity of the inducible anaerobic pathway for NO⋅metabolism and detoxification is less clear, since there is no evidence for a typical NOR in E. coli. The demonstration of NOD induction and a cryptic O2-stimulated and cyanide-sensitive NO⋅ consumption activity in anaerobically grown E. coli exposed to NO⋅ or NO3−suggests an additional role of NOD in anaerobic NO⋅detoxification. However, both the failure of cyanide to inhibit the anaerobic activity in vivo (Table I) and the failure of the induced NOD to metabolize NO⋅ in the absence of O2(Table II) suggests a limited role of NOD/flavohemoglobin in anaerobic NO⋅ metabolism and detoxification. Nevertheless, NOD may have other anaerobic protective functions or may prepare the cell for more efficient NO⋅ detoxification upon exposure to O2. It will now be important to assess the overall contributions of NOD and other potential NO⋅-metabolizing systems, such as the NO⋅-reducing multiheme nitrite reductase (19Costa C. Macedo A. Moura I. Moura J.J.G. Le Gall J. Berlier Y. Liu M.-Y. Payne W.J. FEBS Lett. 1990; 276: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), to NO⋅detoxification in E. coli using deletion strains and overexpressors under various growth conditions. Finally, it is hoped that greater knowledge of the function and regulation of NO⋅ detoxification systems, including the E. coli NOD, may reveal the true antibiotic potential of NO⋅toward a variety of organisms. For example, the greater ability of NO⋅ to inhibit the growth of stationary phase E. coli(Fig. 1) suggests that latent or dormant pathogens will be more susceptible to the antibiotic action of NO⋅ than healthy growing microorganisms simply because they are unable to induce their NO⋅ detoxification systems. Indeed, this may account for the activation of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Leishmania spp. infections in nitric-oxide synthase-deficient mice (1MacMicking J.D. North R.J. LaCourse R.

Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1501-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). The ability of O2 to increase the NO⋅ detoxification capacity of cells through the action of an NOD activity, like that of the (flavo)hemoglobin (20Gardner P.R. Gardner A.M. Martin L.A. Salzman A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10378-10383Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), may also explain the sensitivity of intraerythrocytic malaria parasites to NO⋅ at low O2 tensions (31Taylor-Robinson A.W. Looker M. Lancet. 1998; 351: 1630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Furthermore, greater knowledge of the NODs, NORs, and other NO⋅ detoxification systems may facilitate the design of new drugs that target these systems and allow the expression of the full potential of NO⋅ as a natural broad spectrum antibiotic (3Fang F.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2818-2825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We are grateful to Dr. Edmund Lin for kindly supplying bacterial strains.

Despite the significance of these events, signal transduction pathways of integrins have not been fully understood. One of the approaches for integrin-mediated signal transduction is to study the proteins that are localized to focal adhesions. Focal adhesions are the sites where cells attach to substrata via integrin-extracellular matrix binding (7Schwarts M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar, 8Burridge K. Fath K. Kelly T. Nuckolls G. Turner C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1684) Google Scholar). Various cytoskeletal proteins and signaling molecules such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK),1 paxillin, vinculin, talin, p130Cas, and tensin, are accumulated in the cytoplasmic part of focal adhesions (7Schwarts M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H.

More interestingly, focal adhesions are strongly stained by immunohistochemical analysis with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (7Schwarts M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev.

Several proteins localized to focal adhesions such as FAK, paxillin, and p130Cas, are tyrosine phosphorylated following integrin stimulation (7Schwarts M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar, 9Schaller M.D. Borgman C.A. Cobb B.S. Vines R.R. Reynolds A.B. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

When tyrosine phosphorylated, these proteins bind to signaling molecules such as Crk, Nck, GRB2, Src, which contain Src homology (SH) 2 domain (7Schwarts M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar, 10Hanks S.K. Polte T.R. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Paxillin, a 68-kDa cytoskeletal protein, is one of these focal adhesion proteins (11Turner C.E. Glenney Jr., J.R. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 12Turner C.E. Miller J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Salgia R. Li J.-L. Lo S.H.

First, paxillin appears to be the major entity that recruits two binding proteins, FAK, and vinculin (11Turner C.E. Glenney Jr., J.R. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar, 12Turner C.E. Miller J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Salgia R. Li J.-L. Lo S.H.

Med. 1995; 182: 1089-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 17Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). Second, paxillin is tyrosine phosphorylated following integrin stimulation in a FAK-dependent manner, and then binds to the Crk SH2 domain (15Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 18Bellis S.L. Miller J.T. Turner C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17437-17441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Thus, paxillin is involved in recruitment of FAK to focal adhesions, tyrosine phosphorylated by FAK and/or a kinase(s) that is associated with FAK, and then works as a docking protein in integrin-mediated signal transduction. Hydrogen peroxide-inducible clone (hic)-5 was initially identified as a gene which was induced by transforming growth factor β1 or by H2O2 (19Shibanuma M. Mashimo J. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26767-26774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of hic-5 mRNA was augmented in the in vitrosenescent process of human diploid fibroblasts (19Shibanuma M. Mashimo J. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26767-26774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The forced overexpression of Hic-5 induced growth retardation, senescence-like morphology such as the enlarged and flattened morphology, and the increased expression of p21/WAF1/Cip1/sdi1 and extracellular matrix-related proteins such as fibronectin (FN), collagen, and collagenase (20Shibanuma M. Mochizuki E. Maniwa R. Mashimo J. Nishiya N. Imai S. Takano T. Oshimura M. Nose K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1224-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Hic-5 is involved in very interesting function in the senescent process and in transforming growth factor β1-mediated signal transduction. However, the nature of Hic-5 function has not been clarified yet. Structurally, Hic-5 contains four LIM domains in the C-terminal half and LD domains in the N-terminal half (19Shibanuma M. Mashimo J. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26767-26774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Matsuya M. Sasaki H. Aoto H. Mitaka T. Nagura K. Ohba T. Ishino M. Takahashi S. Suzuki R. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). These domains are conserved in paxillin, and the four LIM domains of Hic-5 and paxillin share 62% homology (17Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar,19Shibanuma M. Mashimo J. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Biol.

These structural homology with paxillin suggested that Hic-5 is localized to focal adhesions and involved in integrin-mediated signal transduction. Recently, Matsuya et al. (21Matsuya M. Sasaki H.

In this study, we demonstrate that Hic-5 is localized to focal adhesions by its LIM domains and binds to the FAK C-terminal domain by its N-terminal half. However, unlike paxillin, Hic-5 is not tyrosine phosphorylated by FAK and by integrin stimulation, suggesting that Hic-5 and paxillin have a different function in integrin-mediated protein tyrosine phosphorylation.

Med. 1995; 182: 1089-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). We reported FAK-paxillin interaction and the paxillin-mediated focal adhesion targeting of FAK (16Tachibana K. Sato T. D'Avirro N. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1089-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Because Hic-5 has a similar structure as paxillin, we studied FAK-Hic-5 interaction and the subcellular localization of Hic-5. To define the FAK-Hic-5 interaction, HA epitope-tagged FAK was coexpressed with c-Myc epitope-tagged Hic-5 or paxillin in COS1 cells. Then, Hic-5 or paxillin was immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Myc mAb, and the coprecipitation of FAK was investigated by immunoblotting with anti-HA mAb. As shown in Fig. 1 A, HA-tagged wild-type FAK was coimmunoprecipitated with Hic-5 and paxillin. A similar result was obtained when HA-tagged FAK C-terminal domain (FAK-CT) was coexpressed with Hic-5 or paxillin. Therefore, like paxillin, Hic-5 can bind to the C-terminal domain of FAK. Paxillin binds to the C-terminal domain of FAK by its N-terminal half. To determine the FAK-binding site of Hic-5, the c-Myc-tagged N-terminal and C-terminal halves of Hic-5 were expressed in COS1 cells and precipitated with the GST fusion protein of the FAK C-terminal domain (GST-FAK-CT). As shown in Fig. 1 B, the wild-type and N-terminal half of Hic-5 were precipitated with GST-FAK-CT, whereas the C-terminal half of Hic-5 was not precipitated with GST-FAK-CT. Taken together, the N-terminal domain of Hic-5 can bind to the FAK-CT. We next defined the binding specificity of FAK to Hic-5 and paxillin. c-Myc-tagged Hic-5 and paxillin were expressed in COS1 cells, precipitated with various mutants of GST-FAK, and detected with immunoblotting with anti-c-Myc mAb. As shown in Fig. 1 C, both Hic-5 and paxillin were precipitated with GST-FAK (903–1052) and its substitution mutants, K933E and Q1040G. However, neither protein were precipitated with GST and GST-FAK mutants, V928G and L1034S. These results indicate that Hic-5 and paxillin share a very similar FAK binding specificity. For further analysis, we developed rabbit anti-Hic-5 polyclonal Ab (pAb) and used this antibody to detect endogenous Hic-5 protein. As shown in Fig. 2 A, a 54-kDa peptide was detected by this anti-Hic-5 pAb in the lysate of rat fibroblast, 3Y1. Since this peptide was migrated to the same size as c-Myc-tagged mouse Hic-5 that was expressed in COS-1 cells by transfection, this 54-kDa peptide represented endogenous Hic-5 in 3Y1 cells. A protein with a similar molecular weight was detected in mouse fibroblasts, Swiss 3T3 cells, although the expression level of this protein was lower than in 3Y1. In Src-transformed 3Y1 cells, a slightly slower migrated protein in addition to this 54-kDa protein was detected. In contrast, a 56-kDa peptide was detected by this anti-Hic-5 pAb in the lysate of human kidney-derived 293T cells, and in African green monkey kidney-derived COS1 cells. p68 paxillin, a Hic-5 related protein, was not detected by this anti-Hic-5 pAb, although paxillin was expressed in these cells as shown by reblotting with anti-paxillin mAb. Using this anti-Hic-5 pAb, we studied the in vivoassociation of Hic-5 and FAK. Endogenous Hic-5 was immunoprecipitated by anti-Hic-5 pAb from the lysate of 293T cells. Then, precipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-FAK mAb. As shown in Fig. 2 B, endogenous FAK was coprecipiated with endogenous Hic-5, indicating the FAK-Hic-5 interaction in vivo. For further analysis, we studied the subcellular localization of Hic-5. Since FAK is localized to focal adhesions, Hic-5 should be localized to focal adhesions if Hic-5 binds to FAK in vivo. We determined the subcellular localization of Hic-5 in 3Y1 cells by immunohistochemical analysis with anti-Hic-5 pAb. As shown in Fig. 3 A, Hic-5 was demonstrated as rod-shaped staining in cytoplasm, mostly in the periphery of a cell, with a direction of peripheral to center of a cell (arrows). This staining of Hic-5 was similar as the staining of vinculin which was shown as typical focal adhesions, and was located at the identical sites with vinculin in double staining, indicating that Hic-5 is localized to focal adhesions in 3Y1 cells. Next, we wished to determine the Hic-5 domain which is responsible for the focal adhesion targeting. Since Brown et al. (17Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar) reported that paxillin is localized to focal adhesions by its C-terminal LIM domains, it is likely that the Hic-5 C-terminal LIM domains are essential for the focal adhesion targeting of Hic-5. To determine the focal adhesion targeting domain of Hic-5, we expressed EGFP-tagged wild-type Hic-5 and its deletion mutants in Swiss 3T3 cells and analyzed their subcellular localization under fluorescent microscopy. As shown in Fig. 3 B, the EGFP-tagged wild-type and C-terminal half of Hic-5 were detected at focal adhesions, whereas EGFP alone and the EGFP-tagged Hic-5 N-terminal half were localized diffusely and were not detected at focal adhesions. Thus, Hic-5 is localized to focal adhesions by its C-terminal LIM domains. However, the EGFP-tagged wild-type and N-terminal half of Hic-5 were localized outside of nuclei, whereas EGFP alone and the EGFP-tagged C-terminal domain were localized both inside and outside of nuclei. Therefore, the N-terminal domain of Hic-5 appears to be involved in the cytoplasmic localization of Hic-5. Thus, Hic-5 and paxillin share not only structural homology, but also several characteristics such as binding activity to FAK and subcellular localization to focal adhesions. However, Hic-5 does not contain several tyrosine residues in paxillin, which are phosphorylated by integrin stimulation and putative binding sites for the Crk SH2 domain. Therefore, we next studied whether Hic-5 is tyrosine phosphorylated by integrin stimulation or not. c-Myc-tagged Hic-5 and paxillin were coexpressed with HA-tagged FAK, immunoprecipitated, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (anti-Tyr(P)). As shown in Fig. 4 A, paxillin was tyrosine phosphorylated when coexpressed with FAK wild-type or Y397F mutant. Since paxillin was not tyrosine phosphorylated when coexpressed with FAK-kinase negative, this phosphorylation of paxillin was dependent on the kinase activity of the coexpressed FAK. Tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin by FAK-Y397F was less compared with that by wild-type FAK. These results were consistent with the reports of Schaller and Parsons (15Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar) and Bellis et al. (18Bellis S.L. Miller J.T. Turner C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17437-17441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), and indicated tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin by FAK and a FAK-associated kinase. Unlike paxillin, Hic-5 was not tyrosine phosphorylated when coexpressed with FAK. These data strongly suggest that Hic-5 is not a substrate of FAK, whereas paxillin is a substrate of both FAK and a tyrosine kinase(s) that binds to phosphorylated FAK-Y397. Next, we investigated tyrosine phosphorylation of Hic-5 by integrin stimulation. c-Myc-tagged Hic-5 or paxillin were expressed in 293T cells by transfection. These 293T cells were detached from substrata, incubated on the plates coated with FN or poly-l-lysine (Sigma), and then lyzed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Hic-5 and paxillin were immunoprecipitated from cellular lysates with anti-c-Myc mAb and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb. As shown in Fig. 4 B, paxillin was tyrosine phosphorylated following integrin stimulation, whereas no increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Hic-5 was observed upon FN stimulation. We also analyzed integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous Hic-5 and paxillin in 293T cells. As shown in Fig. 4 C, paxillin was tyrosine phosphorylated following FN stimulation. In contrast, we observed no increased tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous Hic-5, further indicating that Hic-5 is not tyrosine phosphorylated following integrin stimulation. The expression of Hic-5 is augmented in a senescent process in human fibroblasts. To elucidate a putative function of Hic-5, we studied integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin in the presence or absence of Hic-5. c-Myc-tagged paxillin and Hic-5 were coexpressed in 293T cells. Then, cells were detached and stimulated by the plates coated with FN. Paxillin and Hic-5 were immunoprecipitated with anti-c-Myc mAb and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine mAb. As shown in Fig. 4 D, FN-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin was decreased by the coexpression of Hic-5 in a dose-dependent manner. This result suggests that overexpression of Hic-5 inhibits the signal from tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin. In this article, we have demonstrated that Hic-5, a senescence-related protein, is a cytoskeletal protein localized to focal adhesions. Similar to a related protein, paxillin, Hic-5 is localized to focal adhesions by its C-terminal LIM domains and binds to FAK by its N-terminal domain. Therefore, Hic-5 appears to be involved in the recruitment of FAK to focal adhesions and involved in integrin signal transduction. However, unlike paxillin, Hic-5 is not tyrosine phosphorylated by integrin stimulation, or by the coexpression of FAK. Furthermore, overexpression of Hic-5 inhibited integrin-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. Gilmore and Romer (26Gilmore A.P. Romer L.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1209-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) reported that microinjection of GST-FAK-CT resulted in reduced focal adhesion phosphotyrosine and reduced DNA synthesis. GST-FAK-CT contains the focal adhesion targeting domain, but does not contain a kinase domain. Therefore, GST-FAK-CT inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins by preventing endogenous FAK localization to focal adhesions and the binding of FAK to focal adhesion proteins. These findings strongly suggest that prevention of tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins, such as paxillin, inhibits cell proliferation. The phosphotransfer sites of paxillin are putative binding sites for the SH2 domain of Crk, an oncogenic adapter protein (15Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 18Bellis S.L. Miller J.T. Turner C.E. J. Biol.

Nature. 1988; 332: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Crk is composed of SH2 and SH3 domains (27Mayer B.J. Hamaguchi M. Hanafusa H. Nature. 1988; 332: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Crk binds to tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins by its SH2 domain and binds to the effector proteins by its SH3 domains (28Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3443-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 29Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1465-1473PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, Crk is involved in the recruitment of signaling molecules, such as C3G and SOS, to tyrosine-phosphorylated docking proteins (28Tanaka S. Morishita T. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Shibuya M. Matuoka K. Takenawa T. Kurata T. Nagashima K. Matsuda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3443-3447Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 29Feller S.M. Knudsen B. Hanafusa H. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1465-1473PubMed Google Scholar). Since paxillin is localized at focal adhesions, the binding of Crk to tyrosine-phosphorylated paxillin results in the recruitment of these signaling molecules to focal adhesions that are localized close to cytoplasmic membrane. C3G and SOS are guanine nucleotide exchange factors for Rap1A/k-Rev1 and Ras, respectively (30Gotoh T. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Kitayama H. Noda M. Takai Y. Kaibuchi K. Matsui H. Hatase O. Takahashi H.

Cell. 1991; 67: 701-716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). These small GTPases are involved in the regulation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases (32Davis R.J. Trends Biol. Sci. 1994; 19: 470-473Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar, 33Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar). Inhibition studies using Crk mutants showed that Crk is involved in the regulation of MAP kinase (34Tanaka M. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6829-6837Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 35Kizaka-Kondoh S. Matsuda M. Okayama H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12177-12182Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). v-Crk and C3G are also involved in the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, another MAP kinase family kinase (36Tanaka S. Ouchi T. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 2356-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Taken together, tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin may be involved in the activation of MAP kinase family kinases through the recruitment of Crk. Since activation of MAP kinase family kinases regulates gene expression and cell proliferation, the overexpression of Hic-5 may induce growth retardation by blocking activation of MAP kinases. Inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of focal adhesion proteins causes alterations in cell shape and a decrease in cell migration. FAK knock-out or the overexpression of FAK-CT resulted in enlarged focal adhesions and reduced cell motility (37Ilic D. Furuta Y. Kanazawa S. Takeda N. Sobue K. Nakatsuji N. Nomura S. Fujimoto J. Okada M. Yamamoto T. Aizawa S. Nature. 1995; 377: 539-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1576) Google Scholar, 38Richardson A. Parsons J.T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). More directly, Klemkeet al. (39Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar) reported that the binding of Crk to another focal adhesion protein, Crk-associated substrate (p130Cas), induces cell migration and membrane ruffling (39Klemke R.L. Leng J. Molander R. Brooks P.C. Vuori K. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 961-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). We have observed a similar phenomenon in Cas-L transfected cells. 2K. Tachibana, K. Kamiguchi, T. Azuma, and C. Morimoto, unpublished data. These findings suggest that the recruitment of Crk to paxillin can induce membrane ruffling and cell migration. Therefore, parts of senescent phenotypes, such as the enlarged and flattened morphology of cells, may be caused by the inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. In summary, our study, along with the report of Matsuya et al. (21Matsuya M. Sasaki H. Aoto H. Mitaka T. Nagura K. Ohba T. Ishino M. Takahashi S. Suzuki R. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), addressed that Hic-5 has two distinct functions in integrin-mediated signal transduction, the recruitment of FAK and Cak β to focal adhesions and the inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin. Since integrin-mediated cell adhesion induces cell proliferation and survival, overexpression of Hic-5 may induce senescence-like phenotypes in human diploid fibroblasts by modulating integrin-mediated signal transduction. We also found that paxillin was tyrosine phosphorylated by the coexpression of FAK-Y397F in COS1 cells. Since Src family tyrosine kinases do not bind to FAK-Y397F (40Cobb B.S. Schaller M.D. Leu T.-H. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 147-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), this result indicates that FAK can directly phosphorylate paxillin. We reported previously that Crk-associated substrate (p130Cas) and Cas-L are substrates of FAK (23Tachibana K. Urano T. Fujita H. Ohashi Y. Kamiguchi K. Iwata S. Hirai H. Morimoto C. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29083-29090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Tyrosine-phosphorylated Cas family proteins also bind to Crk (22Minegishi M. Tachibana T. Sato T. Iwata S. Nojima Y. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 184: 1365-1375Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 41Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we propose the following as one of integrin signaling pathways: upon integrin-mediated cell adhesion, focal adhesion proteins such as paxillin and Cas family proteins are tyrosine phosphorylated in a FAK-dependent manner. This leads to the recruitment of Crk to tyrosine-phosphorylated focal adhesion proteins, alternately resulting in integrin-mediated biological signals. We thank Dr. Ravi Salgia and Dr. James D.

https://openalex.org/W1967458195,"Protein targeting to glycogen (PTG), also known as PPP1R5, is a widely expressed member of a growing family of proteins that target protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1) to glycogen particles. Because PTG also binds to glycogen synthase and phosphorylase kinase, it has been suggested that it serves as a “scaffold” for efficient activation of glycogen synthesis. However, very little is known about the metabolic effects of PTG. In this study, we have used recombinant adenovirus to overexpress PTG in primary rat hepatocytes, a cell type with high glycogenic capacity. We find that overexpression of PTG potently activates glycogen synthesis in cultured hepatocytes. Surprisingly, the glycogenic effect of PTG is observed even in the complete absence of carbohydrates or insulin in the culture medium. Furthermore, glycogenolytic agents such as forskolin or glucagon are largely ineffective at activating glycogen degradation in PTG overexpressing hepatocytes, even though large increases in cAMP levels are demonstrated. These metabolic effects of PTG overexpression are accompanied by a 3.6-fold increase in glycogen synthase activation state and a 40% decrease in glycogen phosphorylase activity. Our results are consistent with a model in which PTG overexpression “locks” the hepatocyte in a glycogenic mode, presumably via its ability to promote interaction of enzymes of glycogen metabolism with PP-1.

In recent years, evidence has begun to accumulate in support of the notion that regulation of glycogen metabolism involves movement of relevant enzymes and regulatory factors within cells and the assembly and disassembly of complexes of proteins that mediate glycogen synthesis and degradation (2Hubbard M.J.

This has focused attention on a growing gene family known collectively as glycogen targeting subunits of protein phosphatase-1 that appears to participate in assembly and regulation of the enzymes of glycogen metabolism within mammalian cells. Protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1)1 is responsible for activation of glycogen synthase and inactivation of glycogen phosphorylase and phosphorylase kinase (2Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Discrete targeting of PP-1 to glycogen particles appears to be achieved by its interaction with members of the glycogen targeting subunit family.Four members of the family have been identified. GM, also known as RG1, is a 124-kDa protein that is expressed in heart and skeletal muscle, and its binding to PP-1 enhances dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase, causing activation of glycogenesis (3Tang P.M. Bondor J.A. Swiderek K.M. DePaoli-Roach P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15782-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of GM to promote glycogen synthesis is hormonally regulated by a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanism (15Dent P. Lavoinne A. Nakielny S. Watt P. Cohen P. Nature. 1990; 348: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). GLis a 33-kDa protein that is expressed primarily in liver and appears to be regulated allosterically by binding to phosphorylase a, but not by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (4Doherty M.J. Moorhead G. Morrice N. Cohen P. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). A recently discovered 36.4-kDa isoform known as PTG (protein targeting to glycogen) (6Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), or PPP1R5 (5Doherty M.J. Young P.R. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), also activates glycogen synthesis in a hormone-independent fashion, but is distinct from GL in that it has a wide tissue distribution and no apparent regulation by phosphorylasea. Finally, an isoform termed PPP1R6 has recently emerged that is similar to PTG in its wide distribution and its apparently unregulated interaction with PP-1 (16Armstrong C.G. Browne G.J. Cohen P. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar).While rapid advances have occurred in cloning of isoforms of glycogen targeting subunits and characterization of their interactions with various enzymes of glycogen metabolism, little is known about the metabolic impact of these proteins. Further, the reasons for evolution of distinct glycogen targeting subunit isoforms with different tissue distribution and regulatory properties are poorly understood, and many cell types appear to express more than one isoform. In this study, we have used the efficient recombinant adenovirus gene transfer system to overexpress PTG in primary hepatocytes. This allows us to assess the metabolic impact of increased levels of expression of PTG in a cell type that is known to have a large glycogenic capacity. In addition, these studies begin to address the issue of whether glycogen targeting subunits can be used to enhance glucose storage in liver cells, possibly serving as an approach for lowering blood glucose levels in non-insulin-dependent diabetes, a disease in which hepatic glycogen synthesis is impaired (17Magnusson I. Rothman D.L. Katz L.D. Shulman R.G. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1323-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). We find that PTG overexpression profoundly activates glycogen synthesis, even in the absence of glucose, and that normal hormone- and substrate-mediated regulatory mechanisms are largely overridden by this maneuver. Glycogen storage in liver is a process that has central importance in control of glucose homeostasis (1McGarry J.D. Kuwajima M. Newgard C.B. Foster D.W. Katz J. Annu. Rev.

This has focused attention on a growing gene family known collectively as glycogen targeting subunits of protein phosphatase-1 that appears to participate in assembly and regulation of the enzymes of glycogen metabolism within mammalian cells. Protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1)1 is responsible for activation of glycogen synthase and inactivation of glycogen phosphorylase and phosphorylase kinase (2Hubbard M.J. Cohen P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (790) Google Scholar). Discrete targeting of PP-1 to glycogen particles appears to be achieved by its interaction with members of the glycogen targeting subunit family. Four members of the family have been identified. GM, also known as RG1, is a 124-kDa protein that is expressed in heart and skeletal muscle, and its binding to PP-1 enhances dephosphorylation of glycogen synthase, causing activation of glycogenesis (3Tang P.M. Bondor J.A. Swiderek K.M. DePaoli-Roach P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15782-15789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability of GM to promote glycogen synthesis is hormonally regulated by a phosphorylation/dephosphorylation mechanism (15Dent P. Lavoinne A. Nakielny S. Watt P. Cohen P. Nature. 1990; 348: 302-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). GLis a 33-kDa protein that is expressed primarily in liver and appears to be regulated allosterically by binding to phosphorylase a, but not by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (4Doherty M.J. Moorhead G. Morrice N. Cohen P. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 375: 294-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). A recently discovered 36.4-kDa isoform known as PTG (protein targeting to glycogen) (6Printen J.A. Brady M.J. Saltiel A.R. Science. 1997; 275: 1475-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar), or PPP1R5 (5Doherty M.J. Young P.R. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 339-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), also activates glycogen synthesis in a hormone-independent fashion, but is distinct from GL in that it has a wide tissue distribution and no apparent regulation by phosphorylasea. Finally, an isoform termed PPP1R6 has recently emerged that is similar to PTG in its wide distribution and its apparently unregulated interaction with PP-1 (16Armstrong C.G. Browne G.J. Cohen P. Cohen P.T.W. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 210-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). While rapid advances have occurred in cloning of isoforms of glycogen targeting subunits and characterization of their interactions with various enzymes of glycogen metabolism, little is known about the metabolic impact of these proteins. Further, the reasons for evolution of distinct glycogen targeting subunit isoforms with different tissue distribution and regulatory properties are poorly understood, and many cell types appear to express more than one isoform. In this study, we have used the efficient recombinant adenovirus gene transfer system to overexpress PTG in primary hepatocytes. This allows us to assess the metabolic impact of increased levels of expression of PTG in a cell type that is known to have a large glycogenic capacity. In addition, these studies begin to address the issue of whether glycogen targeting subunits can be used to enhance glucose storage in liver cells, possibly serving as an approach for lowering blood glucose levels in non-insulin-dependent diabetes, a disease in which hepatic glycogen synthesis is impaired (17Magnusson I. Rothman D.L. Katz L.D. Shulman R.G. Shulman G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 1323-1327Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). We find that PTG overexpression profoundly activates glycogen synthesis, even in the absence of glucose, and that normal hormone- and substrate-mediated regulatory mechanisms are largely overridden by this maneuver.

https://openalex.org/W2068198659,"The fdsGBACD operon encoding the four subunits of the NAD+-reducing formate dehydrogenase of Ralstonia eutropha H16 was cloned and sequenced. Sequence comparisons indicated a high resemblance of FdsA (alpha-subunit) to the catalytic subunits of formate dehydrogenases containing a molybdenum (or tungsten) cofactor. The NH2-terminal region (residues 1-240) of FdsA, lacking in formate dehydrogenases not linked to NAD(P)+, exhibited considerable similarity to that of NuoG of the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase from Escherichia coli as well as to HoxU and the NH2-terminal segment of HndD of NAD(P)+-reducing hydrogenases. FdsB (beta-subunit) and FdsG (gamma-subunit) are closely related to NuoF and NuoE, respectively, as well as to HoxF and HndA. It is proposed that the NH2-terminal domain of FdsA together with FdsB and FdsG constitute a functional entity corresponding to the NADH dehydrogenase (diaphorase) part of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase and the hydrogenases. No significant similarity to any known protein was observed for FdsD (delta-subunit). The predicted product of fdsC showed the highest resemblance to FdhD from E. coli, a protein required for the formation of active formate dehydrogenases in this organism. Transcription of the fds operon is subject to formate induction. A promoter structure resembling the consensus sequence of sigma70-dependent promoters from E. coli was identified upstream of the transcriptional start site determined by primer extension analysis."

Based on primary structure, caspases can be divided into two groups, those with long amino-terminal prodomains (class I), and those with relatively short prodomains (class II).

Recent studies suggest that the long prodomains in some class I caspases are able to mediate dimerization of procaspase molecules, thereby promoting autoprocessing.

Caspases are a family of cysteine proteases that cleave their target protein following an Asp residue. Of the eleven published caspases, caspase-1, -4, -5, and -11 seem primarily involved in the processing of proinflammatory cytokines, whereas others play crucial roles in one or more pathways of apoptosis (reviewed in Refs. 1Kumar S.

On the basis of primary structure, proapoptotic caspases can be divided into two classes, class I including caspase-2, -8, -9, and -10 that contain a long amino-terminal prodomain, and class II such as caspase-3, -6, and -7 with a short or absent prodomain. Although numerous studies have provided data on the activation of multiple caspases in apoptosis, the mechanism of activation of the initial caspases in a particular apoptotic pathway is poorly understood. The long prodomain in class I caspases such as caspase-2, -8, and -10 can interact with adaptor molecules that are directly or indirectly recruited to specific death receptors. For example, the prodomains of caspase-8 and -10 contain two death effector domains that interact with the death effector domains in the adaptor molecule FADD, which recruits these caspases to the activated Fas receptor (4Nicholson D.W. Thornberry N.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 230-299Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (2185) Google Scholar, 5Chinnaiyan A.C. Dixit V.M. Semin.

In a similar manner, caspase-2 is thought to be recruited to death receptors by binding through the adaptor RAIDD (8Duan H. Dixit V.M. Nature. 1997; 385: 86-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). The prodomain of caspase-9 shares a degree of homology with the amino terminus of Apaf-1, a CED-4-like mammalian molecule that can interact with caspase-9 (9Li P. Nijhawan D. Budhihardjo I. Srinivasula S. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 91: 479-489Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6257) Google Scholar). Several recent studies demonstrate that procaspases can be activated through dimerization/oligomerization mediated through their prodomains (10Butt A.J. Harvey N.L. Parasivam G. Kumar S. J. Biol.

This suggests that the primary role of adaptor molecules that recruit class I caspases may be to bring procaspase molecules into close proximity with each other to enable dimerization. In vitro cleavage experiments suggest that class II caspases require activated class I caspases for their proteolytic processing (reviewed in Refs. 3Kumar S. Lavin M.F.

We have recently demonstrated that caspase-2, a class I caspase, can dimerize and autoprocess in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammalian cells (10Butt A.J. Harvey N.L. Parasivam G. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6763-6768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The prodomain of caspase-2 is essential for the dimerization of the precursor molecule and caspase-2 lacking the prodomain is poorly processed in S. cerevisiae cells (10Butt A.J. Harvey N.L.

Caspase-3, a class II effector caspase, lacks a long prodomain (17Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M.

Unlike procaspase-2, procaspase-3 is a poor inducer of cell death when transfected in mammalian cells (16Dorstyn L. Kumar S.

Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3802) Google Scholar), presumably because of its inability to autoactivate. We reasoned that if the prodomain of a class I caspase was essential for the activation of a procaspase, fusing a class I caspase prodomain onto a class II caspase would generate a procaspase molecule able to dimerize and mediate autocatalytic processing. In this communication we show that amino-terminal fusion of the caspase-2 prodomain (C2P)1 to procaspase-3 results in remarkable enhancement of its apoptotic activity. We further demonstrate that fusion of C2P to caspase-3 enables the chimeric molecule to dimerize in S. cerevisiaeand to autoprocess in vivo. These data provide direct evidence that the primary function of a class I caspase prodomain is to mediate dimerization and that this dimerization is necessary and sufficient for autoprocessing of the caspase precursor. Our results also establish a structural basis for the functional hierarchy among two classes of caspases. Details of the caspase-GFP fusion constructs used in this study have been described elsewhere (19Colussi P.A. Harvey N.L. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24535-24542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Briefly, caspase coding regions were amplified by polymerase chain reaction using Pfu polymerase and fused in frame to the amino terminus of the mammalian codon optimized GFP in pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH). Caspase-2-GFP contains the entire coding region of mouse Nedd2 (452 amino acid), whereas caspase-2(C320G)-GFP is a catalytically inactive mutant of caspase-2. Caspase-3-GFP contains the full-length coding region of wild-type caspase-3. C2P-caspase-3-GFP and C2P-caspase-3Δ9-GFP are chimeric constructs in which the prodomain of caspase-2 (169 residues in the wild-type or 166 residues in Δ9 chimeric construct) was fused at the amino terminus of caspase-3-GFP. C2P-caspase-3(C163G)-GFP and C2P-caspase-3Δ9(C163G)-GFP constructs were generated from C2P-caspase-3-GFP and C2P-caspase-3Δ9-GFP plasmids, respectively, by site-directed mutagenesis. The C2P-caspase-3Δ9-GFP and C2P-caspase-3Δ9(C163G)-GFP constructs lack the first 9 amino-terminal residues of the caspase-3 precursor (19Colussi P.A. Harvey N.L. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24535-24542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). NIH-3T3 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum. For cell death assays, 2 × 105 cells were plated per 35-mm dish the day before transfection. Expression vectors (2 μg of total DNA) were transfected into cells using the Fugene reagent (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were observed, scored for apoptotic morphology and photographed using a fluorescence microscope (Olympus BH2-RFCA) 18 h post-transfection. For immunoblotting, cells were plated at a density of 6 × 105 cells per 60-mm dish and transfected with a total of 6 μg of plasmid DNA. Cells were harvested 18 h post-transfection. In some cases caspase-GFP expression vectors were cotransfected with either CrmA, P35, MIHA, or Bcl-2 expression constructs at a ratio of 1:3. Construction of CrmA, P35, and MIHA expression vectors has been described previously (16Dorstyn L. Kumar S. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 570-579Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The Bcl-2 expression vector was kindly provided by Dr David Vaux. Proteins were resolved on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels and transferred to polyvinylidine difluoride membrane (DuPont). Blots were probed with an anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (Boehringer Mannheim). Following incubation with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies, signals were detected using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The coding regions of caspase-3 and the caspase-3(C163G) mutant were amplified from the caspase-3-GFP and C2P-caspase-3(C163G)-GFP vectors, respectively, by 30 cycles of polymerase chain reaction using Pfu polymerase (Stratagene). For cloning into yeast Gal4 DNA binding domain (Gal4BD) vector pAS2.1 (CLONTECH), an upstream oligonucleotide containing an EcoRI site (primer A) and a downstream primer containing a BamHI site (primer B) were used, and the amplified product cloned in frame intoEcoRI/BamHI digested pAS2.1. For cloning into the Gal4 activation domain (Gal4AD) vector pACT2 (CLONTECH), an upstream primer containing aBamHI restriction site (primer C) and the downstream primer B were used, and the amplified product cloned in frame intoBamHI digested pACT2. Primer A, 5′-CCGGAATTCGAGAACACTGAAAACTCA; primer B, 5′-GGTGGATCCCGGTGATAAAAATAGAGTTCTTT; primer C, 5′-CGCGGATCCGAGAGAACACTGAAAACTCA (regions complementary to the caspase-3 sequence are underlined). The coding regions of the chimeric caspase-3 molecules containing the caspase-2 prodomain were amplified from the previously described vectors2 C2P-caspase-3(C163G)-GFP, C2P-caspase-3Δ9-GFP and C2P-caspase-3(C163G)Δ9-GFP using the following oligonucleotide primers: primer D, 5′-GGAATTCCATATGGCGGCGCCGAGCGGGA(regions complementary to the caspase-2 sequence are underlined) and primer B described above. The amplified products were digested withBamHI and cloned in frame intoSmaI/BamHI-digested pAS2.1 and pACT2. These assays were essentially carried out as described previously (10Butt A.J. Harvey N.L. Parasivam G. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6763-6768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Caspase-3 constructs in Gal4AD and Gal4BD vectors were cotransformed into S. cerevisiae strain Y190 and colonies containing both vectors were selected on SD medium lacking leucine and tryptophan. Transformed colonies were directly screened for β-galactosidase activity in a colony-lift filter assay using 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal). Overexpression of procaspase-2 results in apoptosis in many cell types, whereas overexpression of procaspase-3 leads to relatively little cell death (13Kumar S. Kinoshita M. Noda M. Copeland N.G.

Nature. 1995; 376: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (3802) Google Scholar). To check if a class I prodomain fused to procaspase-3 can enhance its cell killing activity, we generated expression constructs in which the C2P was placed in frame at the amino terminus of procaspase-3 (Fig. 1 A). We constructed two chimeric expression vectors in which either the full-length procaspase-3 or procaspase-3 lacking the first 9 amino-terminal residues (Δ9) was fused to the prodomain of caspase-2. Because one of the cleavage sites in procaspase-3 occurs following Asp-9 (20Xue D. Horvitz H.R. Nature. 1995; 377: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar), the small prodomain region in caspase-3 and 3 amino acid residues at the carboxyl terminus of the C2P were deleted in the caspase-3Δ9 construct to avoid removal of C2P upon processing in transfected cells. To aid direct visualization of transfected cells we also placed the coding region of GFP at the carboxyl terminus of caspase-3-prodomain chimeric molecules (Fig. 1 A). All control and chimeric expression constructs were transfected into NIH-3T3 cells and visualized by fluorescence microscopy 18 h later. Most cells transfected with the GFP vector control showed normal flat morphology (Figs. 1 B and 2 A). As expected, procaspase-2-GFP expression killed almost all transfected cells (>95%), whereas caspase-3-GFP induced apoptosis in around 15% cells (Fig. 1 B). Most of the caspase-3-GFP transfected cells showed normal morphology and, as reported by us recently (19Colussi P.A. Harvey N.L. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24535-24542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). the caspase-3-GFP fusion protein was localized largely in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2 C). The cells transfected with the procaspase-2-GFP construct showed very weak fluorescence, presumably because of destruction of GFP in apoptotic cells (Fig. 2 B). Although caspase-3-GFP induced apoptosis in some of the transfected cells, apoptotic cells retained fluorescence suggesting that these cells represent early apoptotic cells (data not shown). The chimeric C2P-caspase-3-GFP molecules, with or without the first 9 amino acids of procaspase-3, were potent killers of transfected NIH-3T3 cells when compared with wild-type procaspase-3 with an apoptotic activity comparable with procaspase-2 (Figs. 1 B, 2 D, and 2 E). C2P-caspase-3(C163G)-GFP, the catalytically inactive caspase-3 mutant fused to the caspase-2 prodomain, was unable to induce cell death, suggesting that autocatalytic activity of C2P-caspase-3 was necessary for cell killing (Figs. 1 B and 2 F). As reported recently (19Colussi P.A. Harvey N.L. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24535-24542Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), the C2P-caspase-3(C163G)-GFP mutant chimeric protein localized to discreet “dot-like” structures in both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments of the transfected cells (Fig. 2 F). These results suggest that addition of the caspase-2 prodomain to the amino terminus of caspase-3 can confer strong apoptosis-inducing activity onto caspase-3. However, we do not yet know whether concentration in specific dot-like regions contributes to the apoptotic activity of the chimeric C2P-caspase-3 by promoting oligomerization and processing.Figure 2Immunofluorescence microscopy of various caspase-GFP fusion construct-transfected NIH-3T3 cells.

Therefore, it was of interest to determine whether fusion of the caspase-2 prodomain to caspase-3 would affect interaction of the chimeric molecule with cellular and viral inhibitors of apoptosis. We compared the inhibitory effects of three caspase inhibitors (CrmA, P35, and MIHA/XIAP) and Bcl-2 on apoptosis induced by caspase-2-GFP and caspase-3-GFP containing the caspase-2 prodomain (C2P-caspase-3-GFP). Caspase expression constructs were cotransfected with expression constructs containing one of the inhibitors at a ratio of 1:3, and transfected NIH-3T3 cells scored 18 h later. As shown in Fig. 3, only P35 significantly inhibited caspase-2-GFP induced apoptosis (around 20%). However, C2P-caspase-3-GFP induced apoptosis was strongly inhibited by MIHA and P35, and partially inhibited by Bcl-2 and CrmA (Fig. 3). The observation that C2P-caspase-3-GFP-mediated apoptosis is suppressed by P35 and XIAP, but not by CrmA, is consistent with previously reported inhibitory profiles of caspase-3 (16Dorstyn L.

Nature. 1997; 388: 301-304Crossref Scopus (1724) Google Scholar), suggesting that the C2P-domain fusion does not alter the basic kinetic characteristics of caspase-3. To check whether the addition of the caspase-2 prodomain can mediate in vivo processing of caspase-3, we carried out immunoblotting of the extracts from transfected NIH-3T3 cells. As shown in Fig. 4, this protein did not show any appreciable processing in NIH-3T3 cells transfected with caspase-3-GFP (59 kDa). However, in cells transfected with C2P-caspase-3-GFP, no full-length (77 kDa) protein was detected. Instead, a band of 39 kDa, representing processed p12-GFP protein, was present (Fig. 4), demonstrating that the chimeric molecule containing the caspase-2 prodomain was much more readily processed when compared with wild-type caspase-3. On the other hand, the catalytically inactive C2P-caspase-3(C163G)-GFP protein was detected as a single unprocessed band of 77 kDa (Fig. 4) suggesting that autocatalytic activity of the chimeric caspase is required for its processing. Interestingly, in all transfection experiments, we noticed that the intensity of the processed protein band (39 kDa) representing the p12-GFP protein was always much lower than that of the unprocessed protein, suggesting that the processed caspase subunits may be unstable. This may explain, at least in part, why the GFP fluorescence is very weak in apoptotic NIH-3T3 cells transfected with C2P-caspase-3-GFP or caspase-2-GFP (Fig. 2). In NIH-3T3 cells cotransfected with C2P-caspase-3-GFP and either MIHA or P35, almost complete suppression of processing of the chimeric caspase molecule was seen (Fig. 4), suggesting that MIHA and P35 inhibit C2P-caspase-3-GFP-induced apoptosis by inhibiting procaspase processing. Bcl-2 is known to act upstream of caspase-3 by inhibiting the activation of caspase-9, the class I caspase required for the processing of caspase-3 (9Li P. Nijhawan D. Budhihardjo I. Srinivasula S.

Cell. 1998; 1: 949-957Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). However, Bcl-2 did not inhibit the processing of the C2P-caspase-3 chimeric molecule (Fig. 4). CrmA, which has only a marginal effect on C2P-caspase-3-mediated apoptosis (Fig. 3), also did not inhibit the processing of the chimeric molecule. We also compared the effects of Bcl-2, CrmA, MIHA, and P35 on caspase-2-GFP processing. Consistent with cell killing experiments, none of these molecules completely blocked procaspase-2 processing, as a processed doublet of 39/41 kDa, representing the p12-GFP/p14-GFP was seen in all cases (data not shown). As expected, caspase-2(C320G)-GFP protein was not significantly processed in transfected cells (data not shown). These results provide compelling evidence that the addition of a class I caspase prodomain to a class II caspase can confer autoprocessing ability on class II caspases. Procaspase-2 molecules can dimerize through their prodomains to mediate autocatalysis (10Butt A.J. Harvey N.L. Parasivam G. Kumar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6763-6768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). To check if the chimeric caspase-3 molecule is able to dimerize, we utilized the yeast two-hybrid system. Caspase-3 constructs with or without the caspase-2 prodomain were fused to Gal4 DNA-binding and activation domains in S. cerevisiae vectors. To avoid processing of the molecules in transformed cells, we also used C163G mutants of caspase-3. As shown in Table I wild-type caspase-3 was unable to homodimerize. However, a small number of colonies (<10%) transformed with caspase-3(C163G) mutant exhibited some β-galactosidase activity. This may be because of relatively large amounts of protein expression in some transformed cells carrying high plasmid copy number, which may lead to dimerization. In contrast to caspase-3 and caspase-3(C163G), nearly all (>95%) colonies transformed with the C2P, or the chimeric proteins C2P-caspase-3(C163G) and C2P-caspase-3Δ9(C163G) exhibited β-galactosidase activity (Table I). The chimera containing the wild-type caspase-3 lacking the first 9 amino acid residues (C2P-caspase-3Δ9) was also able to form homodimers, albeit with a lower efficiency (∼70% colonies positive for β-galactosidase). These results suggest that addition of a caspase-2 prodomain onto caspase-3 can greatly enhance the ability of caspase-3 molecules to dimerize.Table IChimeric C2P-caspase-3 proteins homodimerize in S. cerevisiaeGal4BD construct in pAS2.1 vectorGal4AD construct in pACT2 vectorβ-galactosidase activityEmpty vectorEmpty vector—p53SV40 large T+Caspase-3Caspase-3—Caspase-3(C163G)Caspase-3(C163G)±C2PC2P+C2PEmpty vector—Empty vectorC2P—C2P-caspase-3Δ9C2P-caspase-3Δ9+C2P-caspase-3Δ9Empty vector—Empty vectorC2P-caspase-3Δ9—C2P-caspase-3(C163G)C2P-caspase-3(C163G)+C2P-caspase-3(C163G)Empty vector—Empty vectorC2P-caspase-3(C163G)—C2P-caspase-3Δ9(C163G)C2P-caspase-3Δ9(C163G)+C2P-caspase-3Δ9(C163G)Empty vector—Empty vectorC2P-caspase-3Δ9(C163G)—Various caspase-3 and C2P-caspase-3 constructs in Gal4BD and Gal4AD vectors were cotransformed into S. cerevisiae Y190 strain.

Our results provide strong support for the notion that the primary function of the prodomain in class I caspases is to promote dimerization and that dimerization is necessary and sufficient for autoprocessing. These results also support the idea that recruitment of class I caspases through adaptor molecules mediates dimerization and activation of upstream procaspases. Procaspase-8 has been shown to possess some intrinsic protease activity that probably mediates its autoprocessing (11Muzio M. Stockwell B.R. Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2926-2930Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (885) Google Scholar). Because procaspase-3 in transfected cells is not processed, intrinsic protease activity in procaspase-3 may be responsible for its weak apoptosis-inducing activity when overexpressed in mammalian cells. A recently published study shows that artificially induced procaspase-3 oligomerization was sufficient for its activation (25MacCorkle R.A. Freeman K.W. Spencer D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3655-3660Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), supporting our findings. Because most living cells express moderate levels of many procaspases, the intrinsic procaspase activity is unlikely to have any deleterious effect, until dimerization further augments processing and generation of fully activated caspase."

N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) protected granule neurons from apoptosis in medium containing 5 mm K+. Inhibition of apoptosis by NMDA was blocked by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) inhibitor LY294002, but it was unaffected by the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor PD 98059. The antiapoptotic action of NMDA was associated with an increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1), an increase in the binding of the regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase to IRS-1, and a stimulation of PI 3-kinase activity.

Significant inhibition of NMDA-mediated neuronal survival by ethanol (10–15%) was observed at 1 mm, and inhibition was half-maximal at 45–50 mm. Inhibition of neuronal survival by ethanol corresponded with a marked reduction in the capacity of NMDA to increase the concentration of intracellular Ca2+, phosphorylate IRS-1, and activate PI 3-kinase.

Glutamate functions as the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system by activating ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors (1Barnard E.A. Trends Pharmacol.

Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2736) Google Scholar). The NMDA1 receptor is an important subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors that functions as a ligand-gated ion channel and initiates cation influx upon activation by glutamate or NMDA (3Sucher N.J.

Rev. 1994; 74: 723-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Activated NMDA receptors are about 10 times more permeable to Ca2+ than to Na+ and contain regulatory sites for Mg2+, Zn2+, glycine, polyamines, and phencyclidine (3Sucher N.J. Awobuluyi M. Choi Y.B. Lipton S.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1996; 17: 348-355Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 4McBain C.J. Mayer M.L. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 723-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). An increase in [Ca2+]i is central to many of the properties of NMDA receptor activation in the central nervous system, including its role in development, neuroplasticity, and neurotoxicity (4McBain C.J. Mayer M.L. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 723-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar, 5McDonald J.W. Johnston M.V. Brain Res. Rev. 1990; 15: 41-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar). NMDA receptors can produce neurotrophic and/or neurotoxic effects in brain, depending on the stage of development and the degree of receptor activation. During restricted developmental periods, NMDA receptor activation has been shown to be important for maintaining neuronal survival, synaptogenesis, synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory (5McDonald J.W. Johnston M.V. Brain Res. Rev. 1990; 15: 41-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar,6Nakanishi S. Masu M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1994; 23: 319-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). However, excessive NMDA receptor activation can result in neuronal damage and cell death (7Choi D.W. Prog. Brain Res. 1994; 100: 47-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that glutamate-induced cell death in cerebellar granule neurons is composed of sequential necrosis and apoptosis (8Ankarcrona M. Dypbukt J.M. Bonfoco E. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Lipton S.A. Nicotera P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 961-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar). After exposure to glutamate, a subpopulation of granule neurons undergoes rapid necrotic cell killing that is associated with a loss of mitochondrial function. Neurons surviving the early necrotic phase recover their mitochondrial potential and energy levels and sustain delayed apoptotic cell death. Glutamate-induced apoptosis has been shown to involve a Ca2+-dependent activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in cerebellar granule neurons (9Kawasaki H. Morooka T. Shimohama S. Kimura J. Hirano T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18518-18521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In contrast with the excitotoxic effects of high concentrations of NMDA, low doses of NMDA enhance the survival of cerebellar granule neurons (10Gallo V. Kingsbury A. Balázs R. Jõrgensen O.S. J. Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Balázs R. Hack N. Resink A. Aronica E. van der Valk J.B.F. Mol. Neuropharmacol. 1992; 2: 203-206Google Scholar). NMDA promotes the survival of cerebellar granule neurons cultured in the presence of physiological [K+] (5 mm) by inhibiting apoptosis (12Yan G.-M. Ni B. Weller M. Wood K.A. Paul S.M. Brain Res. 1994; 656: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The trophic effects of NMDA in cultured cerebellar granule neurons have been proposed to mimic the ability of glutamatergic innervation in vivo to prevent elimination of postmigratory granule neurons after the formation of synaptic contacts (12Yan G.-M. Ni B. Weller M. Wood K.A. Paul S.M. Brain Res. 1994; 656: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The mechanism underlying the antiapoptotic action of NMDA in cerebellar granule neurons is unknown. The sedative properties of ethanol have led to investigation of its effect on NMDA receptor function. Acute ethanol exposure causes decreases in NMDA-activated ion currents in hippocampal neurons (13Lovinger D.M. White G. Weight F.F. Science. 1989; 243: 1721-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar), NMDA-induced [Ca2+]i responses, and cGMP production in cerebellar granule neurons (14Hoffman P.L. Rabe C.S. Moses F.

Korpi E.R. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1995; 154: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) actions of NMDA are inhibited by ethanol. Further studies have indicated that NMDA receptor activation can protect against ethanol-induced cell death in newly established cultures of cerebellar granule neurons (21Pantazis N.J. Dohrman D.P. Luo J. Thomas J.D. Goodlett C.R. West J.R. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1995; 19: 846-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have recently demonstrated that ethanol can also induce apoptosis by inhibiting IGF-I signaling in cerebellar granule neurons (22Zhang F.X. Rubin R. Rooney T.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Ethanol blocks the antiapoptotic action of IGF-I by inhibiting its ability to promote IRS-1 phosphorylation and stimulate PI 3-kinase. Inhibition of IGF-I signaling by ethanol occurs downstream of the ligand binding site (22Zhang F.X. Rubin R. Rooney T.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 23Resnicoff M. Sell C. Ambrose D. Baserga R. Rubin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21777-21782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is mediated by blocking IGF-I receptor autophosphorylation (23Resnicoff M. Sell C. Ambrose D. Baserga R. Rubin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21777-21782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ethanol also inhibits IGF-I-induced cell proliferation in Balb/c 3T3 cells (23Resnicoff M. Sell C. Ambrose D. Baserga R. Rubin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21777-21782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and IGF-I- and IGF-2-mediated cell growth in C6 rat glioblastoma cells (24Resnicoff M. Rubini M. Baserga R. Rubin R. Lab. Invest. 1994; 71: 657-662PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of cell growth by ethanol in C6 glioblastoma cells is accompanied by a block of IRS-1 phosphorylation and PI-3 kinase activation (24Resnicoff M. Rubini M. Baserga R. Rubin R. Lab. Invest. 1994; 71: 657-662PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have examined the mechanism by which NMDA promotes neuronal survival in cerebellar granule neurons and the involvement of these processes in the neurotoxic action of ethanol. Our data show that the ability of NMDA to inhibit apoptosis in cerebellar granule neurons is associated with a Ca2+-dependent increase in the tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, the binding of PI 3-kinase to IRS-1, and the activation of PI 3-kinase. Ethanol inhibits NMDA-induced [Ca2+]i increases and blocks the capacity of NMDA to protect cerebellar granule neurons from apoptotic cell death. Inhibition of NMDA-mediated neuronal survival by ethanol also corresponds with a marked reduction in the phosphorylation of IRS-1, the binding of PI 3-kinase to IRS-1, and the activation of PI 3-kinase. These data demonstrate that NMDA prevents apoptosis through activation of PI 3-kinase and that ethanol induces cell death in cerebellar granule neurons by inhibiting NMDA-induced activation of a PI 3-kinase-dependent antiapoptotic signaling pathway.

Neurosci. 1987; 7: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cerebella were obtained from Sprague-Dawley rat pups (postnatal day 7–8) and cross-chopped (400 × 400 μm) with a McIlwain tissue chopper (Mickle Laboratory Engineering Co., Surrey, United Kingdom); they were then trypsinized with 0.025% trypsin-EDTA (including 0.01% DNase I) for 15 min at 37 °C. Trypsin digestion was stopped by addition of trypsin inhibitor (0.05%). After trituration, cerebellar granule neurons were plated at a density of 1 × 106 cells/cm2 on 25-mm circular glass coverslips or in plastic multiwells and flasks coated with poly-d-lysine (10 μg/ml) in BME containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 25 mm KCl, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. After 18–24 h, 10 μm cytosine arabinoside was added to the neuronal cultures to inhibit replication of nonneuronal cells. Cerebellar granule neurons were maintained in culture and used at 6–7 daysin vitro. Cerebellar granule neurons were washed twice with serum-free BME containing 25 mm KCl (high K+ (HK)) or 5 mm KCl (low K+ (LK)). Cells were then treated with the indicated agents and incubated for a further 24 h. Ethanol-treated cultures were covered with Parafilm to keep the ethanol concentration constant without interfering with the permeability to gases. After 24 h, the cells were rinsed once with PBS (100 mm phosphate, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.4) and incubated with Hoechst dye 33342 (10 μg/ml) for 10 min or with 0.4% trypan blue for 5 min at room temperature (24 °C). Cell morphology and trypan blue staining were assessed by phase contrast microscopy, and nuclear DNA staining was examined by digital fluorescence imaging microscopy (Olympus). Measurements were obtained from three randomly chosen fields on three different cell preparations. Cell viability was also assessed by the MTT tetrazolium salt assay, essentially as described by Manthorpe et al. (25Manthorpe M. Fagnani R. Skaper S.D. Varon S. Dev. Brain Res. 1986; 25: 191-198Crossref Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Briefly, MTT tetrazolium salt (0.6 mg/ml) was added to neurons grown in 24-well plates and incubated for 2–3 h at 37 °C. The reaction media were then gently aspirated, and isopropanol containing 0.1 n HCl was added to solubilize the blue formazan product. Formazan-isopropanol mixtures were then transferred to 96-well plates and quantified using a Multiskan plate reader at 570 nm (Eflab Oy, Helsinki, Finland). Genomic DNA was isolated from neurons grown in T25 or T75 flasks. Cells were rinsed with BME, scraped, collected in Tris-buffered saline (100 mm Tris, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.5), and lysed with buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 20 mmEDTA, 100 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, 100 μg/ml proteinase K, and 20 μg/ml DNase-free RNase for 3 h at 50 °C. The reaction mixtures were extracted with 1 volume of Tris-EDTA (10 mmTris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.1)-saturated phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), and the aqueous phases were mixed with a 110 volume of 3 m sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and equal volumes of ice-cold isopropanol for 24 h at −20 °C. DNA was then pelleted, air-dried, and dissolved in Tris-EDTA buffer. Total DNA was resolved on a 1.2% agarose gel, stained with 1 μg/ml ethidium bromide, and photographed under UV light. Cells were lysed in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmNa3VO4, and 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin (pH 7.5). Equal amounts of protein (500 μg) from each sample were immunoprecipitated by the addition of a rabbit anti-rat IRS-1 antibody (5 μg) and protein A-agarose. Immunocomplexes were dissolved with Laemmli buffer (26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), separated on a 10% reducing SDS-PAGE gel, and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (PY20) (1:1000) and rabbit anti-rat PI 3-kinase (1:1000) antibody, followed by a secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:5000). The membranes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and quantitated with a Bio-Rad Imaging Densitometer. PI 3-kinase activity was measured, essentially as described previously (27Kato H. Faria T.N. Stannard B. Roberts Jr., C.T. LeRoith D. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2655-2661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Briefly, IRS-1 immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and resuspended in Tris-buffered saline (100 mm Tris, 0.9% NaCl, pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EDTA. The kinase assay was started by addition of a reaction mixture containing 100 mmMnCl2, phosphatidylinositol (2 μg/μl), and [γ-32P]ATP (30 μCi) for 10 min at 24 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 8 n HCl and chloroform:methanol (1:1). The mixtures were centrifuged, and the lower organic phase was applied to a silica gel thin layer chromatography plate. The plate was developed in a chloroform:methanol:water:ammonium hydroxide mixture (60: 47:11.3:2), dried, and autoradiographed. Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate was stained with 0.65% molybdenum oxide in 4.2m sulfuric acid and used to determine the comigration of phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate. Neurons were grown on glass coverslips in the presence of HK medium and used for [Ca2+]i measurements at 6–7 days in vitro. Measurements of [Ca2+]i were obtained from cells loaded with Fura2 by incubation with Fura2/AM (2.5 μm in 0.025% pluronic acid) for 15 min at 37 °C in HEPES buffer (121 mm NaCl, 5 mmNaHCO3, 10 mm Na-HEPES, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO2, 1.2 mmMgSO4, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). After loading, cells were washed once with HEPES buffer containing 2% bovine serum albumin, and then twice with HEPES buffer containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin. Fluorescence images were obtained, essentially as described previously (29Rooney T.A. Sass E. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17131-17141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Coverslips with attached Fura2-loaded granule neurons were transferred to a chamber with 1 ml of HEPES buffer and mounted on the stage of an inverted Olympus epifluorescence microscope. The stage, oil immersion objective, and chamber were thermostatically regulated at 37 °C. A cooled charge-coupled device camera (Photometrics Ltd.) was used as the imaging device. For [Ca2+]i measurements, fluorescent images were collected alternately at excitation wavelengths 340 and 380 nm, with an emission wavelength of 460–600 nm. [Ca2+]i was calculated from the fluorescence measurements using the ratio method, as described previously (29Rooney T.A. Sass E. Thomas A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 17131-17141Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The data represent the mean ± S.E. from three different neuronal culture preparations. Statistical significance was determined by paired Student's ttest. Cerebellar granule neurons were cultured for 7 days in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 25 mm KCl (HK). Neurons were then switched to serum-free medium containing either HK, 5 mm KCl (LK), or LK+NMDA (100 μm). Cell survival was assessed at 24 h by counting apoptotic and nonapoptotic neurons after staining nuclear chromatin with the fluorescent dye Hoechst 33342. Fig. 1demonstrates that almost all of the neurons survived in the presence of HK, whereas 70–80% of the neurons kept in LK were dead. Affected neurons possessed morphologic features consistent with apoptosis, including shrunken cell bodies, cellular and neurite fragmentation, and evidence of vacuoles and detachment of some cells from the substratum (data not shown). An apoptotic process was further indicated by the finding that the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide (10 μg/ml) reduced the number of apoptotic neurons in LK medium by 50–60%. Cerebellar granule neurons also exhibited oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation in LK medium (Fig. 2). There was little or no DNA degradation in cerebellar granule neurons maintained in HK. NMDA (100 μm) inhibited the formation of apoptotic nuclei by >70% (Fig. 1) and prevented DNA degradation (Fig. 2). The protective action of NMDA was completely reversed by the selective NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (Fig. 1). These data are consistent with previous studies (12Yan G.-M. Ni B. Weller M. Wood K.A. Paul S.M. Brain Res. 1994; 656: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 20Bhave S.V. Hoffman P.L. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and establish that NMDA inhibits apoptosis in cerebellar granule neurons under our assay conditions.Figure 2DNA fragmentation analysis. Cerebellar granule neurons were rinsed twice with BME and incubated for 24 h in media containing 25 mm K+ (lane 1), 5 mm K+ (lane 2), 5 mm K+ + 100 μm NMDA (lane 3), 5 mm K+ + 100 μm NMDA + 30 μm LY294002 (lane 4), 5 mmK+ + 100 μm NMDA + 2 mm EGTA (lane 5), 5 mm K+ + 100 μm NMDA + 100 mm ethanol (lane 6), or 5 mm K+ + 100 μm NMDA + 50 μm PD98059 (lane 7). Genomic DNA was isolated from treated neurons grown in T25 flasks and resolved with a 1.2% agarose gel. The gel was then stained with ethidium bromide and photographed under UV light. Results are representative of two or three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Ethanol inhibited the antiapoptotic action of NMDA in cerebellar granule neurons maintained in LK (Figs. 1 and 2). We have shown previously that ethanol does not inhibit the neurotrophic action of elevated K+ or potentiate cell death produced by LK (22Zhang F.X. Rubin R. Rooney T.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The dose-dependent effects of ethanol and NMDA on neuronal survival were investigated further using the MTT assay. Fig. 3 shows that the EC50 for NMDA-mediated neuroprotection was 5.3 μm, with maximal protection obtained with 100 μm NMDA. Ethanol produced near complete inhibition of neuronal survival at all concentrations of NMDA (Fig. 3). At high concentrations of NMDA (>200 μm), the ability to promote neuronal survival was decreased. This is consistent with previous findings in which excessive NMDA receptor stimulation has been shown to be toxic to cerebellar granule neurons (8Ankarcrona M. Dypbukt J.M. Bonfoco E. Zhivotovsky B. Orrenius S. Lipton S.A. Nicotera P. Neuron. 1995; 15: 961-973Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1699) Google Scholar, 9Kawasaki H. Morooka T. Shimohama S. Kimura J. Hirano T. Gotoh Y. Nishida E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18518-18521Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 shows the concentration dependence of ethanol-induced inhibition of NMDA-mediated neuronal survival. Significant inhibition by ethanol (10–15%) was observed at 1 mm, and complete inhibition was obtained at 200 mm. The IC50 for ethanol-induced inhibition was 45–50 mm. A similar dose dependence for ethanol-induced inhibition of NMDA-mediated neuronal survival has been shown in cerebellar granule neurons that have been kept in LK medium for 4 daysin vitro (20Bhave S.V. Hoffman P.L. J. Neurochem. 1997; 68: 578-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that IGF-I-mediated cell survival in cerebellar granule neurons is half-maximal at 2 ng/ml and that ethanol potently inhibits the ability of IGF-I to prevent apoptosis in cerebellar granule neurons (22Zhang F.X. Rubin R. Rooney T.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In view of the similar nature of ethanol interaction with the neurotrophic action of NMDA, we examined whether there is cross-talk between NMDA and IGF-I signaling pathways. Fig. 5 compares the ability of submaximal concentrations of NMDA (1 and 5 μm) and IGF-I (1 and 2 ng/ml) to inhibit apoptosis in cerebellar granule neurons. Addition of 1 μm NMDA or 1 ng/ml IGF-I sustained neuronal survival in 30–32% of cells, and 5 μm NMDA or 2 ng/ml IGF-I protected 44–50% of cerebellar granule neurons from cell death. The combination of these two agonists at each dose caused an entirely additive increase in neuronal survival. The response obtained by combining maximal doses of NMDA (100 μm) and IGF-I (25 ng/ml) was unchanged from that produced by IGF-I alone because this produces full neuroprotection (97 ± 17%) (22Zhang F.X. Rubin R. Rooney T.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). One possible explanation for these results is that NMDA and IGF-I utilize common steps in the activation of the antiapoptotic signaling pathway in cerebellar granule neurons. Previous studies have shown that Ca2+ entry plays an important role in the neurotrophic and neurotoxic actions of NMDA in cerebellar granule neurons (30Manev H. Favaron M. Guidotti Costa E. Mol. Pharmacol. 1989; 36: 106-112PubMed Google Scholar, 31Miller T.M. Tansey M.G. Johnson Jr., E.M. Creedon D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9847-9853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). Fig. 6 shows that NMDA increases [Ca2+]i in single Fura2-loaded cerebellar granule neurons. Both acute (5 min) and prolonged (24 h) exposure to ethanol (100 mm) inhibited NMDA-induced [Ca2+]i increases by 80–85%. NMDA-induced [Ca2+]i increases were also completely inhibited by addition of EGTA (data not shown). To assess the contribution of Ca2+ entry to the neurotrophic action of NMDA, the ability of NMDA to inhibit apoptosis was examined in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Removal of extracellular Ca2+ with EGTA blocked the capacity of NMDA to prevent apoptosis in LK medium (Figs. 2 and 7). These data demonstrate that the antiapoptotic action of NMDA depends on the stimulation of Ca2+ entry and that inhibition of NMDA-mediated neuronal survival by ethanol is associated with a block of NMDA-induced [Ca2+]i increases.Figure 7Signaling pathways involved in NMDA-mediated neurotrophism. Cerebellar granule neurons were rinsed twice with BME and incubated for 24 h in media containing 25 mmK+ (HK), 5 mm K+(LK), 5 mm K+ + 100 μmNMDA (LK+NMDA), 5 mm K+ + 100 μm NMDA + 2 mm EGTA (LK+NMDA+EGTA), 5 mm K+ + 100 μm NMDA + 30 μm LY294002 (LK+NMDA+LY), or 5 mm K+ + 100 μm NMDA + 50 μm PD98059 (LK+NMDA+PD). Cell survival was determined by the MTT assay. The results represent the mean ± S.E. of data from three separate incubations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The downstream signaling pathways responsible for the Ca2+-dependent neurotrophic action of NMDA were examined by investigating the effect of selective protein kinase inhibitors. Addition of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 (30 μm), inhibited the ability of NMDA to prevent DNA fragmentation (Fig. 2) and promote neuronal survival (Fig. 7) in LK medium. By contrast, the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase inhibitor PD98059 (50 μm) had no effect on the antiapoptotic action of NMDA (Figs. 2 and 7). These data are consistent with recent studies of the signaling pathways involved in the antiapoptotic action of IGF-I in cerebellar granule neurons (22Zhang F.X. Rubin R. Rooney T.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 196-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 31Miller T.M. Tansey M.G. Johnson Jr., E.M. Creedon D.J. J. Biol.

IGF-I inhibits apoptosis in cerebellar granule neurons by activating PI 3-kinase through an IRS-1-linked signaling pathway (22Zhang F.X. Rubin R. Rooney T.A. J.

https://openalex.org/W2140701164,"A positional scanning synthetic peptide combinatorial library containing approximately 52 million hexapeptides was used to identify potential inhibitory peptides for recombinant mouse prohormone convertase 1 (PC1) and PC2 and to provide information on the specificity of these enzymes. The library surveys revealed that a P6 Leu, a P4 Arg, a P2 Lys, and a P1 Arg were most inhibitory against PC1, and a P6 Ile and a P4 Arg were most inhibitory against PC2. Using information derived from the library surveys, hexapeptide sets were synthesized and screened for inhibition of PC1 and PC2. The data obtained revealed the preference of both enzymes for a P3 Val. At P5, many substitutions were well tolerated. PC1 and PC2 proved to differ mainly in the selectivity of their S6 subsites. In PC1, this subsite displayed a strong preference toward occupation by Leu; theK i value for peptide Ac-Leu-Leu-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-NH2 was 28 times lower than that for peptide Ac-Ile-Ile-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-NH2. In contrast, PC2 discriminated little between Leu and Ile at P6, as evidenced by the small (1.5-fold) difference in K i values for these two peptides. Several hexapeptides synthesized as a result of the screen were found to represent potent inhibitors of PC2 (withK i values in the submicromolar range) and, particularly, of PC1 (with K i values in the low nanomolar range). The most potent inhibitor, Ac-Leu-Leu-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-NH2, proved to be the same peptide for both enzymes and inhibited PC1 and PC2 in a competitive, fast-binding manner with K i values of 3.2 and 360 nm, respectively. The four most potent peptide inhibitors of PC1 and PC2 were also tested against soluble human furin and found to exhibit a different rank order of inhibition; for example, Ac-Leu-Leu-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-NH2 was 440-fold less potent against furin than against PC1, with a K i of 1400 nm.

Prohormone convertase 1 (PC1)1 and PC2 are members of the prohormone convertase/kexin subfamily of serine proteinases, which is now thought to be responsible for the proteolytic maturation of a variety of proproteins and prohormones (reviewed in Refs. 1Seidah N.G.

Although structurally related to subtilisin in their catalytic domains, these enzymes differ substantially from subtilisin, both in their much greater size and their requirement for basic residues on the NH2-terminal side of the scissile bond (reviewed in Refs. 1Seidah N.G.

Members of this family of enzymes are Ca2+-dependent and, unlike the related family member furin, which is fully active at neutral pH values (3Hatsuzawa K. Nagahama M. Takahashi K. Takada K.

Furin can also be potently inhibited by certain serpins, such as the mutated analog of α1-antitrypsin known as α1-antitrypsin Portland (24Anderson E.D. Thomas L. Hayflick J.S. Thomas G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24887-24891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mutant α1-antitrypsin contains Arg substitutions at positions 358 and 355 (thus generating P1 and P4 Arg residues) and exhibits significantly greater potency for furin over the Pittsburgh variant that lacks a P4 Arg (24Anderson E.D.

The COOH-terminal peptide of the neuroendocrine protein 7B2 has been shown to potently inhibit PC2, but not PC1 (9Lindberg I. Van den Hurk W.H. Bui C. Batie C.J.

Brechler V. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15184-15188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar); however, this has not yet been directly demonstrated in in vitro studies. Recently, in line with the idea that subtilisin propeptides represent potent intramolecular inhibitors (30Zhu X. Ohta Y. Jordan F. Inouye M. Nature. 1989; 339: 483-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), the furin propeptide has also been reported to inhibit furin (31Anderson E.D. Van Slyke J.K. Thulin C.D. Jean F. Thomas G.

Boudreault et al. have also recently demonstrated that the PC1 propeptide (residues 1–98) represents an effective inhibitor of PC1 with a K i value of 6 nm. 2A. Boudreault, D. Gauthier, and C.

In the study reported below, we have used a positional scanning synthetic peptide combinatorial library (PS-SPCL) containing approximately 52 million hexapeptides to identify potential inhibitory peptides for PC1 and PC2 and to provide additional information on the specificity of these two enzymes. PS-SPCLs have proven useful in the identification of antigenic determinants and ligands for various receptors and, more recently, in the identification of enzyme inhibitors (reviewed in Refs. 32Pinilla C.

Deconvolution can be performed either by iterative definition of progressively defined peptide mixtures (34Houghten R.A. Pinilla C. Blondelle S.E. Appel J.R. Dooley C.T. Cuervo J.H. Nature. 1991; 354: 84-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar) or by positional scanning of defined libraries and combination of the most potent residues at each position (35Pinilla C. Appel J.R. Blanc P. Houghten R.A. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 901-905PubMed Google Scholar). An iterative combinatorial approach was successfully used to identify trypsin inhibitors with micromolar IC50 values (36Eichler J. Houghten R.A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 11035-11041Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) as well as potent and selective α-glucosidase inhibitors (37Eichler J. Lucka A.W. Pinilla C. Houghten R.A. Mol. Divers. 1995; 1: 233-240Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The positional scanning format has also been used to identify chymotrypsin inhibitors (38Eichler J. Lucka A.W. Houghten R.A. Pept. Res. 1994; 7: 300-307PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that PC1 and PC2 exhibit rather similar specificity profiles, except for the higher selectivity of the S6 subsite of PC1 compared with that of PC2. We also identify several very potent hexapeptide inhibitors of PC1 (with K ivalues in the low nanomolar range) and several potent inhibitors of PC2 (with K i values in the submicromolar range). A human 7B2 CT peptide consisting of residues 1–18 (terminating in Lys-Lys) was synthesized by Louisiana State University Medical Center Core Laboratories. pGlu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-MCA was purchased from Peptides International, Inc. (Louisville, KY). The PS-SPCL consisted of 120 hexapeptide mixtures with NH2-terminal acetylation and COOH-terminal amidation divided into six groups corresponding to each position within the hexapeptide. For each position, 20 mixtures were surveyed, each of which was defined by 1 of the 20 natural l-amino acids. The undefined positions were occupied by any of the l-amino acids except cysteine. The PS-SPCL and the inhibitory peptides were synthesized at the Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies (San Diego, CA) using simultaneous multiple peptide synthesis methodology as described previously (32Pinilla C.

Purified recombinant mPC1 was obtained from the conditioned medium of methotrexate-amplified Chinese hamster ovary/mPC1 cells using fast performance liquid chromatography as described previously (7Zhou Y. Lindberg I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 5615-5623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), with some modifications. Briefly, a Protein-PakTM Q 8HR column (5 × 50 mm; Waters, Milford, MA) was used in the purification procedure. PC1 was eluted from the column using a 0–100% linear gradient of Buffer B (1m sodium acetate, 20 mm BisTris, pH 6.5, and 0.1% Brij 35) in Buffer A (20 mm BisTris, pH 6.5, and 0.1% Brij 35) for 120 min. This PC1 preparation consisted of an equal mixture of three PC1 forms (87, 74, and 66 kDa), as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. Purified recombinant mPC2 was obtained as described in Lamango et al. (10Lamango N.S. Zhu X. Lindberg I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 330: 238-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) from the conditioned medium of methotrexate-amplified Chinese hamster ovary/mPC2 cells stably supertransfected with cDNAs encoding 21-kDa rat 7B2 (39Zhu X. Lindberg I. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 1641-1650Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Each hexapeptide mixture (final concentration, 1 or 0.5 mg/ml) was preincubated with preactivated PC1 (200 ng) or PC2 (65 ng) in 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5, or pH 5.0 containing 5 mm CaCl2 and 0.4%n-octyl glucoside for 30 min at room temperature, followed by the addition of substrate (pGlu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-MCA; final concentration, 200 μm). The total volume of each reaction mixture was 50 μl. The rate of hydrolysis relative to control samples lacking inhibitors was then determined by measuring the fluorescence of the released AMC over a 3-h (in the case of PC1) or 1-h (in the case of PC2) incubation period at 37 °C, during which time hydrolysis of the substrate proceeded linearly in the absence of inhibitor. Based on the information obtained from the hexapeptide library screening, various hexapeptides (NH2-terminally acetylated and COOH-terminally amidated) were synthesized to further study the subsite binding preferences of potential PC1 and PC2 inhibitors. Initial screening of the peptides for PC1 or PC2 inhibition was performed in an identical fashion to the screening of the PS-SPCL, except that a final peptide concentration of 0.1 μg/ml (against PC1) or 10 μg/ml (against PC2) was used. The apparent inhibition constants (K i(app)) for peptides showing strong inhibition at these concentrations were then determined as described by Salvesen and Nagase (40Salvesen G. Nagase H. Beynon R.J. Bond J.S. Proteolytic Enzymes: a Practical Approach. IRL Press at Oxford University Press, Oxford, New York1989: 83-104Google Scholar) by measuring the rate of substrate hydrolysis in the presence of varying inhibitory peptide concentrations. TheK i values were calculated using theK m values of 11 and 18 μm for PC1 and PC2, respectively, and the relationship K i =K i(app)/(1 + [S]/K m). Against PC1, concentrations between 0 and 1 μg/ml were used for peptides 3, 6, 9, and 12; concentrations between 0 and 3 μg/ml were used for peptide 5; and concentrations between 0 and 10 μg/ml were used for peptides 4, 10, 32, and 38. Against PC2, concentrations between 0 and 100 μg/ml were used for peptides 4, 24, 25, 30, 31, 35, and 36; concentrations between 0 and 40 μg/ml were used for peptides 5, 12, and 32; and concentrations between 0 and 20 μg/ml were used for peptides 3, 6, and 9 (see Tables Table II, Table III, Table IV).Table IIInhibition of PC1 by various hexapeptides tested at 100 ng/mlNo.PeptideRelative inhibition (%)P6 P5 P4 P3 P2 P11Ac-Leu-Lys-Arg-His-Lys-Arg-NH211 ± 32Ac-Leu-Lys-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-NH219 ± 73Ac-Leu-Lys-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-NH259 ± 14Ac-Leu-Leu-Arg-His-Lys-Arg-NH218 ± 15Ac-Leu-Leu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-NH234 ± 56Ac-Leu-Leu-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-NH275 ± 17Ac-Leu-Met-Arg-His-Lys-Arg-NH210 ± 88Ac-Leu-Met-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-NH225 ± 19Ac-Leu-Met-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-NH261 ± 110Ac-Leu-Tyr-Arg-His-Lys-Arg-NH25 ± 211Ac-Leu-Tyr-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-NH222 ± 212Ac-Leu-Tyr-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-NH251 ± 2Inhibition was quantified as the percentage decrease in activity relative to the control without peptides.

Progress curves of mPC1 or mPC2 activity in the presence of Ac-Leu-Leu-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-NH2 or 7B2 CT peptide 1–18 were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer model 650–40 fluorescence spectrophotometer using an excitation and an emission wavelength of 370 (slit width, 5 nm) and 460 nm (slit width, 3 nm), respectively. Assay mixtures (total volume, 400 μl) contained 100 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.5 or 5.0, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.4% n-octyl glucoside, varying amounts of Ac-Leu-Leu-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-NH2 (0, 30, 61, and 121 nm in the case of PC1 and 0, 1.2, 6, and 12 μm in the case of PC2) or 7B2 CT peptide 1–18 (0, 4, 10, and 25 nm), 200 μm substrate, and preactivated PC1 (1.6 μg) or PC2 (180 ng). Reactions were initiated by adding the enzyme and conducted at 37 °C. Partially purified furin was obtained from the medium of the baculovirus-infected Hi5 cells. Hi5 cells (20 × 106) in serum-free EXCELL 401 medium were transfected with furin-baculovirus stock virus (16Bravo D.A. Gleason J.B. Sanchez R.I. Roth R.A. Fuller R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25830-25837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After 74 h, the medium was centrifuged at 1,000 ×g for 15 min to remove cells and dialyzed against several changes of Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 mm o-phenanthroline) as described previously (16Bravo D.A. Gleason J.B. Sanchez R.I. Roth R.A. Fuller R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25830-25837Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dialysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was applied onto a 25-ml (1.6 × 12.5 cm) fast-flow Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with Buffer A. The column was washed with 200 ml of Buffer A and eluted with a gradient of 0–80% Buffer B (Buffer A with 300 mmNaCl and 5% glycerol) for 80 min. In a total volume of 50 μl, preactivated furin (corresponding to 250–300 pmol/h AMC released from pGlu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-MCA) was preincubated with varying amounts (ranging from 0 to 0.1 mg/ml) of different synthetic peptides in 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1 mm CaCl2 for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was initiated by adding pGlu-Arg-Thr-Lys-Arg-MCA to a final concentration of 60 μm; incubations were then conducted for 1 h at 37 °C. The K i values were determined in the same fashion as described for PC1 and PC2, using aK m value of 3 μm for this substrate. To gain insight into which residues might be important for inhibition of PC1 and PC2, the PS-SPCL with acetylated NH2 and amidated COOH termini was screened for competitive inhibition of PC1 or PC2 activity. With PC2, the mixtures were screened a total of 11 times at several different peptide concentrations. For PC2, but not for PC1, some variability was observed between screenings, possibly due to differences in enzyme preparations, library handling, and/or unknown factors. With PC1, the mixtures were screened a total of three times at final peptide concentrations of 1 and 0.5 mg/ml, and the results of the three screenings were consistent. A representative screen with PC1 is shown in Fig. 1, using a final library concentration of 1 mg/ml. At positions P1, P2, P4, and P6, a clear preference emerged for Arg, Lys, Arg, and Leu, respectively. At the P3 position, a slight preference for Val was found. At the P5 position, no amino acid residue had remarkable inhibitory potency, and no clear consensus emerged. Surprisingly, some peptides appear to have activating effects. The reasons for this are not clear; one possible explanation is that activating peptides may bind to PC1 not at the active site but at an allosteric site, thereby increasing enzyme activity. However, further work must be done to support this idea. Results of the hexapeptide library screenings against PC2 are shown in Table I. At position P1, Arg consistently exhibited profound inhibition; in other screenings, Lys His, and Glu were also frequently found to be inhibitory. At P2, many amino acids were inhibitory. Lys was among the top three inhibitory amino acids in most screenings, consistent with the known cleavage site preference for Lys-Arg pairs within prohormones. At the P3 position, no clear consensus emerged during any of the screenings, except a slight preference for Phe, Val, Leu, and occasionally Lys. At the P4 position, as in the case with PC1, a clear preference for Arg emerged; in five of eight screenings of the library, Arg was by far the most inhibitory amino acid. Met, Lys, and Tyr were also occasionally inhibitory at this position. At the P5 position, Ile and Lys were slightly preferred in half of the screenings; other inhibitory amino acids included His, Ser, and Pro. At the P6 position, Glu was preferred in six screenings; other inhibitory amino acids at this position included Ile, Lys, and His. Based on the results of early screenings, several consensus peptides were synthesized. P5/P6 Arg/Lys was used, based primarily on the known presence of this basic pair at PC cleavage sites within prohormones.Table ISPCL survey for PC2Test no.Inhibitory amino acid residuesP6P5P4P3P2P11MEHIKSHTRHLKKHDEH2EIYRNoneNoneHR3EIPGHIKRKMRManyEFKMHR4EIGSTYNFLMVYEFKPYNone5EIMRFMVKR6EIRKHIKPRRACFGLVDFKEKR7KEFHWPHIRKIndnd8EFHNoneRFHKNHKRHKConsensusEIIKRMFVKRResults are from eight independent experiments.nd, not done.

Twelve PC1-targeted peptides were synthesized by selecting the best-inhibiting amino acids at the P1–P6 positions. Each peptide had Leu, Arg, Lys, and Arg at positions P6, P4, P2, and P1, respectively. Position P3 was occupied by either Val, Thr, or His, and position P5 was occupied by either Leu, Met, Tyr, or Lys. Synthetic peptides were initially tested for their inhibitory potencies against PC1 at a final concentration of 0.1 μg/ml. These results are shown in Table II. K ivalues were then determined for selected peptides (Table III). As is evident in Tables I and II, a distinct binding preference can be observed at the P3 subsite. The inhibition potency declined in the order Val, Thr, and His. Hexapeptides with Val at this position proved to be very potent inhibitors of PC1, with K i values in the low nanomolar range. The most potent peptide, Ac-Leu-Leu-Arg-Val-Lys-Arg-NH2, exhibited aK i value of 3.2 nm. Replacement of Val with Thr resulted in a 5-fold increase in the K ivalue (peptides 6 and 5), and the presence of His rather than Val at this position produced an even larger increase of 20–30-fold (peptides 6 and 4; peptides 12 and 10). Substitutions at position P5 were better tolerated than those at the P3 subsite. Replacement of Leu (which proved to be more preferable at this subsite) with Met, Lys, or Tyr resulted in only a 2–3.6-fold increase in the K i values (peptides 6, 3, 9, and 12; peptides 4 and 10). Interestingly, a double substitution of Leu by Ile at po"

Conceivably, hepatitis delta antigen per se or together with some other factor(s) acts as an RNA chaperone that modulates the ribozyme activity of HDV RNA.RNA chaperones are proteins that aid in the process of RNA folding by preventing misfolding or by resolving misfolded species (20Herschlag D.

The RNA chaperone activities of several proteins that bind RNA with broad specificity have been explored through their effects on hammerhead ribozyme reactions and group I intron reactions. These proteins, including the nucleocapsid protein (NC) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the C-terminal domain of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (A1 CTD), and Escherichia coli ribosomal proteins, can overcome the general limitations of ribozyme reactions, such as the formation/dissociation of base pairs and the adoption of functional structure, and facilitate ribozyme catalysis (21Tsuchihashi Z.

Using the facilitation of trans-cleavage reactions of the previously characterized hammerhead ribozyme HH16 and its 17-nucleotide substrate S (25Hertel K.L. Herschlag D. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3374-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) as the initial assay, we identify the strand-annealing and strand-dissociation activities of hepatitis delta antigen peptides. We then show that the functional hepatitis delta antigen peptides promote RNA unfolding that stimulates interstranded duplex formation. This activity is able to activate an antisense RNA as well as facilitate trans-acting hammerhead ribozymes to find their targets in cognate substrate RNAs. In addition, hepatitis delta antigen peptides can modulate the cis-cleaving activity of HDV genomic RNA fragments. Hepatitis delta antigen acts as an RNA chaperone and the RNA chaperone domain locates at the N-terminal domain of the protein that contains a high density of basic amino acids. Our findings suggest that the RNA binding domains of hepatitis delta antigen identified previously are, therefore, not required for RNA chaperone activity. Hepatitis delta virus (HDV)1 is a subviral pathogen that requires hepatitis B virus (HBV) to supply envelope protein for completion of package, secretion, and infection (1Rizzetto M. Hoyer B.

HDV codes one protein of two forms during infection: the small delta antigen (SdAg) contains 195 aa and the large delta antigen (LdAg) has an extra 19 aa at the C terminus (5Weiner A.J. Choo Q.L.

Science. 1992; 256: 1331-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). There are two RNA binding domains in each protein form. The first is the arginine-rich sequence near the N terminus, and the second is the arginine-rich motifs (ARMs) located at the middle one-third of the protein (8Poisson F. Roingeard P. Baillou A.

In the present work we show that replacement of glycine 338 of NhaA with serine (G338S) alleviates the pH control of the antiporter. Monitoring Na+-dependent collapse of ΔpH, to assess antiporter activity in isolated membrane vesicles, shows that the mutant protein is practically independent of pH, between pH 7 and 9, and even at pH 6 is 70% active. Similarly the purified reconstituted mutant protein catalyzes pH-independent passive efflux of22Na from proteoliposomes as well as ΔpH-driven influx. Whereas the native NhaA in isolated membrane vesicles is exposed to digestion by trypsin only above pH 7, the mutated protein is degraded already at pH 6.5. ΔnhaAΔnhaB cells transformed with a plasmid encoding the pH-independent antiporter are sensitive to Na+ but not to K+ at alkaline pH, while growing in the presence of both ions at neutral pH. Several possibilities that could explain the Na+ sensitivity of the mutant at alkaline pH were excluded; Western analysis and measurement of Na+/H+ antiporter activity in membrane vesicles, isolated from cells shifted to the non-permissive growth conditions, showed neither reduced expression of G338S-NhaA nor defective activity. The finding that the mutated protein is electrogenic led to the retraction of the idea that the protein is active in vitro but not in vivo at alkaline pH, when only Δψ exists in the cells. The Na+ concentration needed for half-maximal activity of G338S in isolated everted membrane vesicles is similar to that of the wild type. Therefore an increase in intracellular Na+ due to a reduced antiporter affinity could not explain the results. It is suggested that the loss of growth at alkaline pH in the presence of Na+ is due to the loss of the pH control of the mutated NhaA. Indeed, in the four mutations suppressing G338S phenotype, growth at alkaline pH was restored together with the pH regulation of NhaA.

Sodium proton antiporters are ubiquitous membrane proteins found in the cytoplasmic and organelle membranes of cells of many different origins, including plants, animals, and microorganisms. They are involved in cell energetics and play primary roles in the regulation of intracellular pH, cellular Na+ content, and cell volume (reviewed in Refs. 1Padan E. Schuldiner S. Bakker E.

Chem. 1992; 267: 11064-11068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that specifically exchange Na+ or Li+ for H+ (4Schuldiner S. Padan E. Bakker E. Alkali Cation Transport Systems in Procaryotes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 25-51Google Scholar). nhaA is indispensable for adaptation to high salinity, for challenging Li+ toxicity, and for growth at alkaline pH (in the presence of Na+) (7Padan E. Maisler N. Taglicht D. Karpel R. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20297-20302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, expression of nhaA which is dependent on NhaR, a positive regulator, is induced by Na+, in a pH-dependent manner (8Karpel R. Alon T. Glaser G. Schuldiner S. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21753-21759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Rahav-Manor O. Carmel O. Karpel R. Taglicht D. Glaser G. Schuldiner S. Padan E. J. Biol.

Kotler Y. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1729-1734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Both the NhaA and NhaB are electrogenic antiporters that have been purified to homogeneity and reconstituted in a functional form in proteoliposomes (12Taglicht D. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11289-11294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Pinner E. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol.

The H+/Na+stoichiometry of NhaA is 2H+/Na+ and that of NhaB 3H+/2Na+. NhaB but not NhaA is sensitive to amiloride derivatives, and the rate of activity of NhaA but not of NhaB is drastically dependent on pH, changing itsV max over 3 orders of magnitude from pH 7 to pH 8 (12Taglicht D. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11289-11294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Interestingly, a strong pH sensitivity is characteristic of antiporters as well as other transporters and proteins involved in pH regulation (15Padan E. Microbiology and Biochemistry of Hypersaline Environments.in: Oren A. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1998Google Scholar). Identifying the amino acid residues involved in the pH sensitivity of these proteins is important for understanding the mechanism of pH regulation.None of the eight histidines of NhaA were found essential for the Na+/H+ antiporter activity of NhaA (16Gerchman Y. Olami Y. Rimon A. Taglicht D. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, replacement of histidine 225 by Arg (H225R) suggested that His-225 has an important role in the pH sensitivity of the antiporter (16Gerchman Y. Olami Y. Rimon A. Taglicht D. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Whereas the activation of the wild-type NhaA occurs between pH 7.5 and pH 8, that of H225R antiporter occurs between pH 6.5 and pH 7.5. In addition, whereas the wild-type antiporter remains almost fully active, at least up to pH 8.5, H225R is reversibly inactivated above pH 7.5, retaining only 10–20% of the maximal activity at pH 8.5 (16Gerchman Y. Olami Y. Rimon A. Taglicht D. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Furthermore, replacement of His-225 with either cysteine (H225C) or serine (H225S) but not alanine (H225A) yielded an antiporter with a wild-type pH-sensitive phenotype, implying that polarity and/or hydrogen bonding, the common properties shared by His, Cys, and Ser, are essential at position 225 for pH regulation of NhaA (17Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Olami Y. Schuldiner S. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26813-26817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).Recently, we have found that NhaA undergoes a conformational change upon its activation by pH which can be probed by trypsin. Thus both the native NhaA as well as H225R, the mutant with a pH profile shifted toward acidic pH, are susceptible to trypsin in isolated membrane vesicles only at the pH range where they are active and reflecting the level of activity (18Rothman A. Gerchman Y. Padan E. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14577-14582Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).In the present work we found that glycine 338 affects the pH response of NhaA, and its replacement with serine (G338S in TMS1 XI) produced a transporter which in contrast to the wild-type protein lacks pH control; it is active between pH 6.5 and 8.5 and accordingly is exposed to trypsin digestion throughout this pH range. As a result of the loss of pH control, the mutant cells become sensitive to alkaline pH in the presence of Na+. Four second-site suppressor mutations, restoring growth at alkaline pHout, were isolated. Three of these mutations cluster in TMS IV, but in all of them the pH response of NhaA was restored.DISCUSSIONOne of the most interesting characteristics of NhaA, the main Na+/H+ antiporter of E. coli, is its drastic dependence on pH. In the present work we found that replacement of Gly-338 of NhaA with serine (G338S) produced an antiporter, which, to a large extent, lost its pH regulation. In contrast to the wild-type antiporter, which shuts off at pH 6.5 and increases activity by 3 orders of magnitude with increasing pH to pH 8.5, G338S is hardly affected by pH values between pH 7 and 9 and even at pH 6 is 70% active. This property of G338S was observed in both isolated everted membrane vesicles as well as proteoliposomes, containing purified His-tagged derivative of G338S. For unknown reasons, the mutated His-tagged protein was less active (by about 40–50%), as compared with the His-tagged wild-type protein. Since similar reduction in activity was observed in everted membrane vesicles harboring the His-tagged mutated protein, it cannot be ascribed to any of the reconstitution steps.We have previously suggested (18Rothman A. Gerchman Y. Padan E. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14577-14582Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that the activation of NhaA by pH is accompanied by a conformational change which can be detected, using trypsin digestion as a probe. Thus both the wild-type NhaA as well as its mutant H225R, with a pH profile shifted by half a pH, are susceptible to proteolytic digestion, each at the pH range where it is activated, pH 7 to pH 8.5 or pH 6.5 to 8, respectively. The results presented here (Fig. 4) strengthen the suggestion that the two events, exposure to proteolysis and activation, are related; a single replacement, G338S, relieves NhaA of the control by pH and produces a protein that is active between pH 6 and 9. At the same time it renders the protein as accessible to digestion by trypsin at pH 6.5 as at pH 8.5. Hence it is suggested that when the protein is inactive, the protein adopts a “closed” conformation, which is not susceptible to trypsinization, despite the existence of many tryptic cleavage sites. When it is active, the conformation state is open, and more domains are exposed to the enzyme.The mutation yielding G338S antiporter was obtained by selection for growth at neutral pH but not at alkaline pH (8.3) in the presence of Na+ (0.6 m). The mutant grew, however, at alkaline pH in the presence of K+ (0.6 m). Hence, the combination of alkaline pH and high Na+ harms G338S cells rather than each condition separately or osmolarity.We have previously shown that increased antiporter activity is a prerequisite for growth at alkaline pH in the presence of Na+. Transformation of the ΔnhaAΔnhaB strain with multicopy plasmids bearing nhaA restores growth at alkaline pH in the presence of Na+. Accordingly, although being fully active at pH 7.5 but inactive at pH 8.5, the H225R antiporter could not support growth of the ΔnhaAΔnhaB mutant at alkaline pH in the presence of Na+ (16Gerchman Y. Olami Y. Rimon A. Taglicht D. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Based on these data the mutants obtained, with the selection used here, were expected to have low antiporter activity, due to either defects in activity, lack of expression, and/or impaired pH control, failing to activate the antiporter at alkaline pH. Indeed 5 out of the 6 mutants isolated expressed an inactive or defective antiporter (Fig. 2).However, the G338S phenotype, an active antiporter that confers Na+ sensitivity at alkaline pH, was unexpected and puzzling. It was therefore first considered that at alkaline pH in the presence of Na+, G338S is not expressed or expressed in an inactive form. These possibilities were ruled out since Western analysis and measurement of the Na+/H+antiporter activity in membrane vesicles, isolated from cells shifted to alkaline pH in the presence of Na+, showed that G338S protein is present in the membrane at significant amounts and is active.A third possibility considered was that the G338S protein is electroneutral and therefore is inactive in vivo at alkaline pH due to the lack of ΔpH, the driving force. At alkaline pH in E. coli the only component of the Δμ̃H+ that is maintained by respiration is Δψ (27Padan E. Zilberstein D. Rottenberg H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 63: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This possibility was ruled out since G338S was found electrogenic and thus capable of utilizing Δψ (Fig. 3).An increase in the K m for Na+ of the mutated protein was also considered since in this case intracellular Na+ concentration would increase to levels higher than normal and inhibit growth. Furthermore, Na+ is expected to be more toxic at alkaline pH (15Padan E. Microbiology and Biochemistry of Hypersaline Environments.in: Oren A. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1998Google Scholar). This explanation was also excluded since the Na+ concentration needed for half-maximal activity of G338S antiporter, in isolated everted membrane vesicles, was even lower than that of the wild type.To identify the missing property of G338S we screened for mutations that suppress G338S phenotype and allow growth at alkaline pH in the presence of Na+. Four suppressor mutations were obtained. Remarkably, in all of them, the growth at alkaline pH in the presence of Na+ was regained, together with the capacity of pH to control NhaA, and shut down significantly its activity between pH 6 and pH 6.5 (Fig. 5). The possibility that the restoration of these two phenotypes has been a coincidence is highly unlikely, in view of the four independent suppressions obtained. Note, however, that a complete arrest of the Na+/H+ activity was observed only in everted membrane vesicles isolated from Sup150 and at pH 6, half a pH unit more acidic than the pH that shuts off the wild-type protein. Remarkably, the effect of the suppression mutation of Sup150 on the pH regulation of the antiporter was even more pronounced in a wild-type genotype background. The pH profile of P129L protein was shifted toward alkaline pH, with respect to both the wild-type and P129L/G338S proteins (Fig. 5).Why lack of pH control and sustained high activity of the antiporter at all pH values impair growth at alkaline pHout (in the presence of Na+) but not at neutral pHout? One explanation would be over-acidification of the cytoplasm. This possibility, however, is unlikely for two reasons: alkaline pHout should have improved, rather than impaired, growth; and addition of weak bases, a procedure shown to titrate and increase pHin (29Tokuda H. Unemoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10007-10014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not rescue G338S.We have previously shown that at alkaline pH in the presence of high Na+, E. coli is under energetic stress (27Padan E. Zilberstein D. Rottenberg H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 63: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 30Harel-Bronstein M. Dibrov P. Olami Y. Pinner E. Schuldiner S. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3816-3822Google Scholar) which is reflected in a growth rate slower than that at neutral pH. This stress would be aggravated by a high turnover of an uncontrolled antiporter, which would consume the already limited energy resources. We therefore suggest that the mutant G338S and its suppression revealed the importance of the pH set point of NhaA activity.In addition to G338S, His-225 is the only other residue of NhaA that has been shown to affect pH regulation of the antiporter (16Gerchman Y.

(Tokyo). 1997; 121: 661-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, these residues differ in various aspects as related to the antiporter structure/function relationship. (a) The topology of the residues within the protein is different. Based onphoA fusions, proteolysis, from either side of the membrane, and epitope mapping, we have previously advanced a putative two-dimensional model of NhaA (32Rothman A. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32288-32292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this model His-225 is located at the periplasmic edge of TMS VIII and exposed outward. This has recently been proven by probing H225C with membrane-impermeant SH reagents (22Olami Y. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Rothman A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1761-1768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). According to this model, Gly-338 is located in the middle of the hydrophobic TMS XI. (b) The residues are involved in different steps of the pH response of NhaA. We did not succeed in obtaining second-site suppressor mutations in codon H225R, and the first-site suppressor mutations maintain the drastic dependence on pH, although within a new range. In contrast to His-225 mutants, the pH control of G338S is alleviated, and we did obtain second-site suppressor mutations to G338S, but none map in H225R codon. Accordingly, as probed by trypsin, replacements in His-225 shift the pH profile of the “open” conformation of NhaA, whereas Gly-338 maintains this conformation at all pH values.One of the Gly-338 suppressor mutations maps in the loop connecting TMS XI and XII, the other three clusters in TMS IV (32Rothman A. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32288-32292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This clustering is most interesting since Asp-133, in the vicinity, has recently been shown to be involved in the functioning of NhaA (33Inoue H. Noumi T. Tsuchiya T. Kanazawa H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The suppression mutations may even indicate that TMS IV and XI interact. Sodium proton antiporters are ubiquitous membrane proteins found in the cytoplasmic and organelle membranes of cells of many different origins, including plants, animals, and microorganisms. They are involved in cell energetics and play primary roles in the regulation of intracellular pH, cellular Na+ content, and cell volume (reviewed in Refs. 1Padan E. Schuldiner S. Bakker E.

Mackie G.A. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2615-2619Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) and NhaB (6Pinner E. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11064-11068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that specifically exchange Na+ or Li+ for H+ (4Schuldiner S. Padan E. Bakker E. Alkali Cation Transport Systems in Procaryotes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 25-51Google Scholar). nhaA is indispensable for adaptation to high salinity, for challenging Li+ toxicity, and for growth at alkaline pH (in the presence of Na+) (7Padan E. Maisler N. Taglicht D. Karpel R. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20297-20302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, expression of nhaA which is dependent on NhaR, a positive regulator, is induced by Na+, in a pH-dependent manner (8Karpel R. Alon T. Glaser G. Schuldiner S. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21753-21759Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Rahav-Manor O. Carmel O. Karpel R. Taglicht D. Glaser G. Schuldiner S. Padan E. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1981-1989Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). nhaB by itself confers a limited sodium tolerance to the cells but becomes essential when the lack of NhaA activity limits growth (11Pinner E. Kotler Y. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1729-1734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Both the NhaA and NhaB are electrogenic antiporters that have been purified to homogeneity and reconstituted in a functional form in proteoliposomes (12Taglicht D. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11289-11294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Pinner E. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol.

The H+/Na+stoichiometry of NhaA is 2H+/Na+ and that of NhaB 3H+/2Na+. NhaB but not NhaA is sensitive to amiloride derivatives, and the rate of activity of NhaA but not of NhaB is drastically dependent on pH, changing itsV max over 3 orders of magnitude from pH 7 to pH 8 (12Taglicht D. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11289-11294Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, a strong pH sensitivity is characteristic of antiporters as well as other transporters and proteins involved in pH regulation (15Padan E. Microbiology and Biochemistry of Hypersaline Environments.in: Oren A. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1998Google Scholar). Identifying the amino acid residues involved in the pH sensitivity of these proteins is important for understanding the mechanism of pH regulation. None of the eight histidines of NhaA were found essential for the Na+/H+ antiporter activity of NhaA (16Gerchman Y. Olami Y. Rimon A. Taglicht D. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). However, replacement of histidine 225 by Arg (H225R) suggested that His-225 has an important role in the pH sensitivity of the antiporter (16Gerchman Y. Olami Y. Rimon A. Taglicht D. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Whereas the activation of the wild-type NhaA occurs between pH 7.5 and pH 8, that of H225R antiporter occurs between pH 6.5 and pH 7.5. In addition, whereas the wild-type antiporter remains almost fully active, at least up to pH 8.5, H225R is reversibly inactivated above pH 7.5, retaining only 10–20% of the maximal activity at pH 8.5 (16Gerchman Y. Olami Y. Rimon A. Taglicht D. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Furthermore, replacement of His-225 with either cysteine (H225C) or serine (H225S) but not alanine (H225A) yielded an antiporter with a wild-type pH-sensitive phenotype, implying that polarity and/or hydrogen bonding, the common properties shared by His, Cys, and Ser, are essential at position 225 for pH regulation of NhaA (17Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Olami Y. Schuldiner S. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26813-26817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Recently, we have found that NhaA undergoes a conformational change upon its activation by pH which can be probed by trypsin. Thus both the native NhaA as well as H225R, the mutant with a pH profile shifted toward acidic pH, are susceptible to trypsin in isolated membrane vesicles only at the pH range where they are active and reflecting the level of activity (18Rothman A. Gerchman Y. Padan E. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14577-14582Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the present work we found that glycine 338 affects the pH response of NhaA, and its replacement with serine (G338S in TMS1 XI) produced a transporter which in contrast to the wild-type protein lacks pH control; it is active between pH 6.5 and 8.5 and accordingly is exposed to trypsin digestion throughout this pH range. As a result of the loss of pH control, the mutant cells become sensitive to alkaline pH in the presence of Na+. Four second-site suppressor mutations, restoring growth at alkaline pHout, were isolated. Three of these mutations cluster in TMS IV, but in all of them the pH response of NhaA was restored. DISCUSSIONOne of the most interesting characteristics of NhaA, the main Na+/H+ antiporter of E. coli, is its drastic dependence on pH. In the present work we found that replacement of Gly-338 of NhaA with serine (G338S) produced an antiporter, which, to a large extent, lost its pH regulation. In contrast to the wild-type antiporter, which shuts off at pH 6.5 and increases activity by 3 orders of magnitude with increasing pH to pH 8.5, G338S is hardly affected by pH values between pH 7 and 9 and even at pH 6 is 70% active. This property of G338S was observed in both isolated everted membrane vesicles as well as proteoliposomes, containing purified His-tagged derivative of G338S. For unknown reasons, the mutated His-tagged protein was less active (by about 40–50%), as compared with the His-tagged wild-type protein. Since similar reduction in activity was observed in everted membrane vesicles harboring the His-tagged mutated protein, it cannot be ascribed to any of the reconstitution steps.We have previously suggested (18Rothman A. Gerchman Y. Padan E. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14577-14582Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that the activation of NhaA by pH is accompanied by a conformational change which can be detected, using trypsin digestion as a probe. Thus both the wild-type NhaA as well as its mutant H225R, with a pH profile shifted by half a pH, are susceptible to proteolytic digestion, each at the pH range where it is activated, pH 7 to pH 8.5 or pH 6.5 to 8, respectively. The results presented here (Fig. 4) strengthen the suggestion that the two events, exposure to proteolysis and activation, are related; a single replacement, G338S, relieves NhaA of the control by pH and produces a protein that is active between pH 6 and 9. At the same time it renders the protein as accessible to digestion by trypsin at pH 6.5 as at pH 8.5. Hence it is suggested that when the protein is inactive, the protein adopts a “closed” conformation, which is not susceptible to trypsinization, despite the existence of many tryptic cleavage sites. When it is active, the conformation state is open, and more domains are exposed to the enzyme.The mutation yielding G338S antiporter was obtained by selection for growth at neutral pH but not at alkaline pH (8.3) in the presence of Na+ (0.6 m). The mutant grew, however, at alkaline pH in the presence of K+ (0.6 m). Hence, the combination of alkaline pH and high Na+ harms G338S cells rather than each condition separately or osmolarity.We have previously shown that increased antiporter activity is a prerequisite for growth at alkaline pH in the presence of Na+. Transformation of the ΔnhaAΔnhaB strain with multicopy plasmids bearing nhaA restores growth at alkaline pH in the presence of Na+. Accordingly, although being fully active at pH 7.5 but inactive at pH 8.5, the H225R antiporter could not support growth of the ΔnhaAΔnhaB mutant at alkaline pH in the presence of Na+ (16Gerchman Y. Olami Y. Rimon A. Taglicht D. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Based on these data the mutants obtained, with the selection used here, were expected to have low antiporter activity, due to either defects in activity, lack of expression, and/or impaired pH control, failing to activate the antiporter at alkaline pH. Indeed 5 out of the 6 mutants isolated expressed an inactive or defective antiporter (Fig. 2).However, the G338S phenotype, an active antiporter that confers Na+ sensitivity at alkaline pH, was unexpected and puzzling. It was therefore first considered that at alkaline pH in the presence of Na+, G338S is not expressed or expressed in an inactive form. These possibilities were ruled out since Western analysis and measurement of the Na+/H+antiporter activity in membrane vesicles, isolated from cells shifted to alkaline pH in the presence of Na+, showed that G338S protein is present in the membrane at significant amounts and is active.A third possibility considered was that the G338S protein is electroneutral and therefore is inactive in vivo at alkaline pH due to the lack of ΔpH, the driving force. At alkaline pH in E. coli the only component of the Δμ̃H+ that is maintained by respiration is Δψ (27Padan E. Zilberstein D. Rottenberg H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 63: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). This possibility was ruled out since G338S was found electrogenic and thus capable of utilizing Δψ (Fig. 3).An increase in the K m for Na+ of the mutated protein was also considered since in this case intracellular Na+ concentration would increase to levels higher than normal and inhibit growth. Furthermore, Na+ is expected to be more toxic at alkaline pH (15Padan E. Microbiology and Biochemistry of Hypersaline Environments.in: Oren A. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1998Google Scholar). This explanation was also excluded since the Na+ concentration needed for half-maximal activity of G338S antiporter, in isolated everted membrane vesicles, was even lower than that of the wild type.To identify the missing property of G338S we screened for mutations that suppress G338S phenotype and allow growth at alkaline pH in the presence of Na+.

Remarkably, in all of them, the growth at alkaline pH in the presence of Na+ was regained, together with the capacity of pH to control NhaA, and shut down significantly its activity between pH 6 and pH 6.5 (Fig. 5). The possibility that the restoration of these two phenotypes has been a coincidence is highly unlikely, in view of the four independent suppressions obtained. Note, however, that a complete arrest of the Na+/H+ activity was observed only in everted membrane vesicles isolated from Sup150 and at pH 6, half a pH unit more acidic than the pH that shuts off the wild-type protein. Remarkably, the effect of the suppression mutation of Sup150 on the pH regulation of the antiporter was even more pronounced in a wild-type genotype background. The pH profile of P129L protein was shifted toward alkaline pH, with respect to both the wild-type and P129L/G338S proteins (Fig. 5).Why lack of pH control and sustained high activity of the antiporter at all pH values impair growth at alkaline pHout (in the presence of Na+) but not at neutral pHout? One explanation would be over-acidification of the cytoplasm. This possibility, however, is unlikely for two reasons: alkaline pHout should have improved, rather than impaired, growth; and addition of weak bases, a procedure shown to titrate and increase pHin (29Tokuda H. Unemoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10007-10014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not rescue G338S.We have previously shown that at alkaline pH in the presence of high Na+, E. coli is under energetic stress (27Padan E.

This stress would be aggravated by a high turnover of an uncontrolled antiporter, which would consume the already limited energy resources. We therefore suggest that the mutant G338S and its suppression revealed the importance of the pH set point of NhaA activity.In addition to G338S, His-225 is the only other residue of NhaA that has been shown to affect pH regulation of the antiporter (16Gerchman Y.

This possibility, however, is unlikely for two reasons: alkaline pHout should have improved, rather than impaired, growth; and addition of weak bases, a procedure shown to titrate and increase pHin (29Tokuda H. Unemoto T. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 10007-10014Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not rescue G338S. We have previously shown that at alkaline pH in the presence of high Na+, E. coli is under energetic stress (27Padan E. Zilberstein D. Rottenberg H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1976; 63: 533-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar, 30Harel-Bronstein M. Dibrov P. Olami Y. Pinner E. Schuldiner S. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3816-3822Google Scholar) which is reflected in a growth rate slower than that at neutral pH. This stress would be aggravated by a high turnover of an uncontrolled antiporter, which would consume the already limited energy resources. We therefore suggest that the mutant G338S and its suppression revealed the importance of the pH set point of NhaA activity. In addition to G338S, His-225 is the only other residue of NhaA that has been shown to affect pH regulation of the antiporter (16Gerchman Y. Olami Y. Rimon A. Taglicht D. Schuldiner S. Padan E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1212-1216Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 17Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Olami Y. Schuldiner S. Padan E. J. Biol.

(Tokyo). 1997; 121: 661-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). However, these residues differ in various aspects as related to the antiporter structure/function relationship. (a) The topology of the residues within the protein is different. Based onphoA fusions, proteolysis, from either side of the membrane, and epitope mapping, we have previously advanced a putative two-dimensional model of NhaA (32Rothman A. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32288-32292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In this model His-225 is located at the periplasmic edge of TMS VIII and exposed outward. This has recently been proven by probing H225C with membrane-impermeant SH reagents (22Olami Y. Rimon A. Gerchman Y. Rothman A. Padan E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1761-1768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). According to this model, Gly-338 is located in the middle of the hydrophobic TMS XI. (b) The residues are involved in different steps of the pH response of NhaA. We did not succeed in obtaining second-site suppressor mutations in codon H225R, and the first-site suppressor mutations maintain the drastic dependence on pH, although within a new range. In contrast to His-225 mutants, the pH control of G338S is alleviated, and we did obtain second-site suppressor mutations to G338S, but none map in H225R codon. Accordingly, as probed by trypsin, replacements in His-225 shift the pH profile of the “open” conformation of NhaA, whereas Gly-338 maintains this conformation at all pH values. One of the Gly-338 suppressor mutations maps in the loop connecting TMS XI and XII, the other three clusters in TMS IV (32Rothman A. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32288-32292Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This clustering is most interesting since Asp-133, in the vicinity, has recently been shown to be involved in the functioning of NhaA (33Inoue H. Noumi T. Tsuchiya T. Kanazawa H. FEBS Lett. 1995; 363: 264-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The suppression mutations may even indicate that TMS IV and XI interact."
https://openalex.org/W2069817389,"Hydropathy profile analysis of the amino acid sequence of the Na+/proline transporter of Escherichia coli (PutP) suggests that the protein consists of 12 transmembrane domains (TMs) which are connected by hydrophilic loops (Nakao, T., Yamato, I., and Anraku, Y. (1987) Mol. Gen. Genet. 208, 70–75). We have tested this prediction by applying a gene fusion approach in combination with a Cys accessibility analysis and site-specific proteolysis. Characterization of a series of PutP-alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) and PutP-β-galactosidase (LacZ) hybrid proteins yields a reciprocal activity pattern of the reporter proteins that is in agreement with the topology of TMs III to XII of the 12-helix model. Placement of the PutP-PhoA and PutP-LacZ junction sites closer to the N terminus does not yield conclusive results. As a prerequisite for further topology studies, a functional PutP molecule devoid of all five native Cys residues (Cys-free PutP) is generated. Subsequently, amino acids in Cys-free PutP are replaced individually with Cys, and the accessibility of the sulfhydryl groups is analyzed. Surprisingly, Cys residues placed close to the N terminus of PutP (Ile-3 → Cys, Thr-5 → Cys) or into putative TM II (Ser-71 → Cys, Glu-75 → Cys) are highly accessible to membrane permeant and impermeant thiol reagents in intact cells. In contrast, Cys at the C terminus (Ser-502 → Cys) reacts only with the membrane permeant but not with the impermeant reagent in intact cells. These results contradict the 12-helix motif and indicate a periplasmic location of the N terminus whereas the C terminus faces the cytoplasm. In addition, a transporter with Cys in place of Leu-37 (putative periplasmic loop (pL2) shows the same accessibility pattern as the Cys at the C terminus. Furthermore, PutP which has been purified and reconstituted into proteoliposomes in an inside-out orientation, is readily cleaved by the endoproteinase AspN before Asp-33 (pL2), Asp-112 (putative cytoplasmic loop (cL3), Asp-262 (cL7), and Asp-356 (cL9). These results suggest a cytosolic location of Asp-33 and Leu-37, thereby implying the formation of an additional TM formed by amino acids of pL2. Based on these observations, a new secondary structure model is proposed according to which the protein consists of 13 TMs with the N terminus on the outside and the C terminus facing the cytoplasm. The 13-helix structure is discussed as a common topological motif for all members of the Na+/solute cotransporter family.

The Na+/proline transporter of Escherichia coli (PutP) is an integral membrane protein that catalyzes the coupled translocation of Na+ ions and proline (1Chen C.C. Tsuchiya T. Yamane Y. Wood J.M. Wilson T.H. J. Membr. Biol. 1985; 84: 157-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 2Stewart L.M.D. Booth I.R. FEMS Microbiol.

PutP belongs to a family of homologous Na+-dependent membrane transport proteins (Na+/solute cotransporter family, SCF)1 that comprises more than 35 members of bacterial, yeast, insect, nematode, and mammalian origin (4Reizer J. Reizer A. Saier M.H.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1197: 133-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 5Turk E. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 159: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Based on the hydropathy profile of the amino acid sequence of PutP, a secondary structure model has been proposed according to which the transporter consists of a short N-terminal tail, 12 transmembrane domains (TMs) in α-helical conformation that traverse the membrane in zig-zag fashion connected by hydrophilic loops, and a hydrophilic C-terminal tail (6Nakao T. Yamato I. Anraku Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 208: 70-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Experimental evidence for the cytoplasmic location of the C terminus comes from immunological studies (7Komeiji Y. Hanada K. Yamato I. Anraku Y. FEBS Lett. 1989; 256: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). However, recent N-glycosylation scanning mutagenesis of the human Na+/glucose transporter (SGLT1), another member of the SCF, suggests a 14-helix motif for this transporter (8Turk E. Kerner C.J. Lostao M.P. Wright E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1925-1934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Because PutP lacks a C-terminal extension, 13 TMs are predicted for this and other prokaryotic members of the SCF (5Turk E. Wright E.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1997; 159: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). In this study, we have tested the different topological predictions for PutP. In addition, our attention is focused on the topological location of the recently identified functional important amino acid residues, Asp-55 and Ser-57, which are proposed to be involved in ligand binding (9Quick M. Tebbe S. Jung H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 10Quick M. Jung H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4631-4636Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). To obtain experimental evidence on the topology of PutP, we have generated and characterized a series of putP-phoA and putP-lacZ fusions. In addition, information on the arrangement of the PutP polypeptide has been gained from a Cys accessibility analysis and site-specific proteolysis. Periplasmic alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) and cytosolic β-galactosidase (LacZ) have already been used successfully as reporter proteins to determine the topological arrangement of a variety of membrane proteins in the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane (11Boyd D.

Also, site-directed labeling and specific proteolysis of membrane proteins are established methods for topology analysis (14Kaback H.R. Jung K. Jung H. Wu J. Prive G.G. Zen K. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1993; 25: 627-636PubMed Google Scholar, 15Rothman A. Padan E. Schuldiner S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 1761-1768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The results obtained in the course of this study demonstrate that the N terminus of PutP is located on the periplasmic side of the membrane whereas the C terminus faces the cytoplasm. Furthermore, amino acids of former periplasmic loop (pL) 2 are proposed to form an additional TM (now TM II) whereas the boundaries of former TM II (now TM III) are shifted by eight amino acids toward the C terminus of PutP. The resulting 13-helix motif is discussed as a common structural feature of members of the SCF. l-[14C]proline (261 μCi/μmol), sheep anti-(mouse-IgG)-horseradish peroxidase and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate were purchased from Amersham Buchler, Braunschweig, Germany.

E. coli WG170 (F− trp lacZ rpsL thi Δ(putPA)101 proP219) (18Stalmach M.E. Grothe S. Wood J.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 156: 481-486Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) harboring given plasmids was used for overexpression of theputP gene and transport assays.

Biochem. 1996; 239: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) a derivative of plasmid pT7–5 (19Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2436) Google Scholar) containing the lac promoter/operator region as well as theputP gene was used for genetic manipulations and expression of the putP gene and putP-phoA and putP-lacZ fusions. Plasmid pTrc99a (20Amann E. Ochs B. Abel K.J. Gene. 1988; 69: 301-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar) was applied for overexpression of the putP gene. PutP gene fusions were overexpressed using plasmid pBAD24 (21Guzman L.M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3886) Google Scholar). To facilitate genetic manipulations, a cassette version of the putP gene was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using plasmid pT7–5/putP (9Quick M. Tebbe S. Jung H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and mutagenic oligonucleotides. The resulting pT7–5/putP(cassette) contained unique restriction sites of the following enzymes (cutting sites are shown in parentheses): BamHI (292), NcoI (296),ApaI (428), XbaI (661), BssHII (740),NheI (868), SalI (976), PstI (1080),AflII (1320), SpeI (1486), MluI (1573), Eco47III (1776), and HindIII (1805) (only sites located within or at the ends of putP were listed). The nucleotide substitutions introduced into the putP gene did not alter the amino acid sequence of PutP. For immunological detection and protein purification, a nucleotide sequence encoding the peptides DYKDDDDK (Flag epitope) and ASSHHHHHH was introduced at the 3′ end of the putP(cassette) gene yielding plasmid pT7–5/putP(FH). Furthermore, based on oligonucleotide-directed, site-specific mutagenesis of putP(FH), the five native Cys residues of the transporter were replaced simultaneously with Ala (Cys-12, -141, and -281) or Ser (Cys-344 and -349), yielding Cys-free PutP(FH). Subsequently, different amino acid residues in the Cys-free transporter were substituted individually by Cys, resulting in proteins containing only a single thiol group. For overexpression,putP(FH) and its variants were cloned into plasmid pTrc99a using restriction endonucleases NcoI and HindIII. The resulting constructs were verified by DNA sequencing of double-stranded DNA using the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination method after alkaline denaturation (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52232) Google Scholar). Active transport was measured in E. coli WG170 producing PutP or its variants with 5 μml-[14C]proline in the presence of 20 mmd-lactate and 50 mm NaCl at 25 °C using the rapid filtration method as described (10Quick M. Jung H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4631-4636Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). E. coli WG170 harboring plasmid pTrc99a/putP(FH) encoding Cys-free or single Cys PutP(FH) was grown aerobically in LB medium (23Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. A Laboratory Manual and Handbook for Escherichia coli and Related Bacteria. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1992: 439Google Scholar) containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C, and expression was initiated by addition of 0.3 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) at the middle of the exponential growth phase. After further cultivation for 25 min (or 45 min if indicated), cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with 100 mm KPi, pH 7.5, containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (buffer A) and resuspended in the same buffer to give a final protein concentration of 14 mg/ml. For blocking of periplasmic thiol groups, an aliquot of the cell suspension (1.5 ml) was preincubated with 400 μm (or 1 mm if indicated) of the membrane impermeant thiol reagent 4-acetamido-4′-maleimidylstilbene-2,2′-disulfonate (SM) at room temperature. After 30 min, cells were washed three times with buffer A and resuspended in the same buffer as described above. Aliquots (1.5 ml) of blocked and untreated cells were reacted with 400 μm 3-(N-maleimidylpropionyl)biocytin (BM) at room temperature for 30 min. Subsequently, labeled cells were washed three times with buffer A and disrupted by sonication followed by low speed centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C to remove unbroken cells. Membranes were collected by centrifugation at 230,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C, washed with 100 mm KPi, pH 8.0, and resuspended in the same buffer. For solubilization of labeled Cys-free or single Cys PutP(FH), the membrane suspension was supplemented with 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol and 10% glycerol. β-d-Dodecylmaltoside was added dropwise to yield a final concentration of 1.5% (w/v) while stirring on ice. After additional stirring for 30 min, the sample was centrifuged at 230,000 ×g for 20 min. The supernatant was supplemented with 10 mm imidazole and 300 mm NaCl and loaded onto a Ni2+-NTA spin column pre-equilibrated with 100 mm KPi, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol (v/v), 0.04% β-d-dodecylmaltoside (w/v) (buffer E). Unbound protein was removed by washing the Ni2+-NTA spin column with 0.6 ml of buffer E and 1.8 ml of buffer E containing 30 mmimidazole. The transporter was eluted from the spin column with 200 μl of a 200 mm imidazole solution in buffer E. Aliquots of the purified protein were subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (10% acrylamide) (43Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205463) Google Scholar). The amount of protein was judged after Coomassie Blue staining. Reaction of single Cys PutP(FH) with biotin maleimide was determined by Western blot analysis using streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. PutP(FH) was purified and reconstituted into proteoliposomes in an inside-out orientation as described (42Jung H. Tebbe S. Schmid R. Jung K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 11083-11088Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes containing PutP(FH) were diluted in 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, to yield a final protein concentration of 0.25 mg/ml. The endoproteinase AspN was added at a PutP(FH):AspN ratio of 200:1 (w/w), and proteolysis was carried out at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped by addition of 25 mm EDTA after 0.5 or 17 h of incubation. Subsequently, the protein was solubilized in 1% SDS, subjected to SDS-PAGE (10% acrylamide) according to Schägger and Jagow (24Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10407) Google Scholar), and stained with silver (25Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3720) Google Scholar). N-terminal sequencing was performed as described (26Schmid R. Bernhardt J. Antelmann H. Volker A. Mach H. Volker U. Hecker M. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 991-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Initially, a unique NheI site was introduced at the 3′ end of a cassette version of the putP gene in plasmid pT7–5 lacking the NheI site at position 868 by oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis. For fusion of putP with phoA, the resulting plasmid pT7–5/putPNheI was digested with NheI and BanI. The fragment (4,064 base pairs) containing full-lengthputP and part of plasmid pT7–5 was ligated with a 1,527-base pair fragment obtained from plasmid pT7–5/lacY-phoA (27Ujwal M.L. Jung H. Bibi E. Manoil C. Altenbach C. Hubbell W.L. Kaback H.R. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14909-14917Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) digested with the same two restriction enzymes. The latter fragment carried the phoA gene and the remaining part of plasmid pT7–5. The procedure yielded plasmid pT7–5/putP(S502)phoA, 2putP-phoA and putP-lacZfusions are designated by the one-letter code of the C-terminal amino acid residue of the corresponding PutP moiety followed by its position in the transporter and phoA and lacZ, respectively.which contained the full-length putP gene followed at its 3′ by a unique NheI site and the phoA gene. For fusion of putP with lacZ, the latter gene was amplified by PCR, thereby introducing restriction sites forNheI and HindIII at the 5′ and 3′ end, respectively, of lacZ. The PCR fragment was cloned into plasmid pT7–5/putPNheI using the NheI and HindIII restriction sites yielding plasmid pT7–5/putP(S502)lacZ. FurtherputP-phoA and putP-lacZ fusions were generated using PCR with antisense primers that were complementary to the 3′ termini of the desired putP fragments. In addition, the primers created an NheI site at the 3′ termini of the different putP fragments. The sense primer was complementary to an appropriate sequence upstream of the newly generatedNheI site. The amplified fragments were digested withNheI and an appropriate enzyme upstream of theNheI site and then cloned into plasmids pT7–5/putP(S502)phoA and pT7–5/putP(S502)lacZ digested with the same two restriction enzymes. For expression, the gene fusions were cloned into plasmid pBAD24. Desired gene fusions were identified by restriction analysis and finally sequencing of plasmid DNA (22Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52232) Google Scholar). E. coli CC181 harboring the desiredputP-phoA or putP-lacZ fusion in plasmid pT7–5 (or pBAD24) was cultivated in LB medium at 37 °C. In the exponential growth phase, the cells were induced with 0.5 mm IPTG (or 0.2% arabinose (w/v) in case of pBAD24) for 2 h. Alkaline phosphatase and β-galactosidase activities were assayed by measuring the rate of hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate and o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside, respectively, by permeabilized cells (13Calamia J. Manoil C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4937-4941Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar, 28Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1972: 54Google Scholar). Assays were performed in triplicate. E. coli CC181 harboring plasmid pBAD24 with the desired putP-phoA orputP-lacZ fusion was cultivated and induced as described above. Cells from a 1-ml aliquot of the cultures were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in SDS lysis buffer (60 mmTris/HCl, pH 6.8, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol (v/v), 2% SDS (w/v), 0.005% bromphenol blue (w/v)). Ten micrograms of total cells protein from each culture were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 7.5% (PutP-LacZ) or 11% (PutP-PhoA) polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (0.45 μm pore size), and hybrid proteins were probed with mouse antiserum raised against alkaline phosphatase or β-galactosidase followed by incubation with horseradish-peroxidase linked sheep-anti-mouse-IgG antibody. Protein determination was performed using a modification of the method of Lowry (29Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7064) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as standard. For generation of gene fusions, a unique NheI site was introduced at the 3′ end of full-length putP followed by the phoA orlacZ gene. Based on these constructs, furtherputP-phoA and putP-lacZ fusions were generated by shifting the NheI site (junction site) from the 3′ end of putP toward the 5′ end by oligonucleotide-directed, site-specific mutagenesis. The gene fusions were expressed in E. coli CC181 from the lac promoter in plasmid pT7–5, and the activity of the reporter proteins was determined in permeabilized cells (Table I). Hybrid proteins with junction sites after Glu-446, Pro-393, Leu-302, Glu-217, and Gly-157 of PutP showed high PhoA (>100 units) and low LacZ (<5 units) activities, indicating a location of these sites at or close to the periplasm. A reverse activity pattern (PhoA < 20, LacZ > 120 units) was observed when the junction site was placed after Ser-502, Thr-426, His-365, Met-259, Gln-190, Lys-121, Gly-116, Glu-102, and Arg-96 of the transporter. The latter results indicate that the C-terminal amino acids of the corresponding PutP fragments are located at or close to the cytosolic side of the membrane. Further analysis of PutP-PhoA hybrid proteins revealed a 5- to 10-fold increase in alkaline phosphatase activity upon shifting the junction site from Arg-96 to Trp-90 in PutP. Hybrid proteins with PutP-PhoA junction sites in the loop between putative TMs I and II showed intermediate alkaline phosphatase activities. The corresponding PutP-LacZ hybrids exhibited relatively high β-galactosidase activities. Because the latter results were not conclusive, the topology of the N-terminal part of PutP could not be further defined by the gene fusion method.Table IActivities of PutP-PhoA and PutP-LacZ hybrid proteinsJunction sitePhoA activityLacZ activitypT7–5pBADpT7–5pBADSer-502117470760Gln-446140120327Thr-42684120120Pro-393150260534His-3651224150173Leu-302100105116Met-2591391120146Glu-217120264237Gln-1901051170365Gly-157120482113Lys-1211092150677Gly-1162064340NDGlu-1022730550NDArg-96768490NDTrp-90130327380NDLeu-8468520310NDSer-50542782001499Thr-2951403461358The C-terminal amino acid of the PutP fragment in the hybrid proteins is shown.PhoA and LacZ activities were determined with permeabilizedE. coli CC181 cells producing the desired hybrid protein by measuring the rate of hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate and o-nitrophenyl-β,d-galactoside, respectively, at 420 nm.

Attempts were made to estimate the amount of hybrid protein in cells of E. coli CC181 by Western blot analysis using antibodies directed against PhoA or LacZ. However, expression of the gene fusions from the lac promoter did not yield reproducible results because of the instability particularly of the inactive hybrid proteins. Therefore, putP-phoA and putP-lacZ gene fusions were cloned into plasmid pBAD24 containing the arabinose PBAD promoter that, after induction with 0.2% arabinose, gave higher levels of gene expression than the lac system. Thus, using the pBAD vector higher reporter protein activities were found in E. coli CC181 cells than with the lacsystem (Table I). However, the overall alkaline phosphatase/β-galactosidase activity patterns of both expression system were similar. Furthermore, the pBAD system allowed the detection of PhoA and LacZ with specific antibodies raised against these proteins. Representative blots are shown in Figs. 2 and 3. As expected from the C-terminal truncation of PutP, hybrid proteins of decreasing size (starting from S502PhoA or S502LacZ) were detected on the blot. Most of the hybrid proteins showed some degree of instability, yielding degradation products that corresponded to the PhoA or LacZ moiety of the proteins. A similar instability of hybrid proteins was observed in other studies (30Haardt M. Bremer E. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 5370-5381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Pourcher T. Bibi E. Kaback H.R.

Cells of E. coli WG170, producing the resulting transporter, catalyzed Na+-coupled proline uptake with 50% of the V max and up to 100% of the steady-state level of proline accumulation of cells containing wild-type PutP. Further kinetic analysis of Cys-free PutP revealed an apparent K m for proline of 5 ± 0.4 μm compared with 2 ± 0.2 μmwild-type. In contrast to the effect on wild-type PutP,N-ethylmaleimide did not inhibit transport catalyzed by the Cys-free protein. Furthermore, immunological analysis did not reveal significant differences between the amounts of wild-type and Cys-free PutP in the membrane. These results indicate that none of the Cys residues was essential for activity and/or insertion of the protein into the membrane. To provide a chemical reactive group at a defined position in the primary structure of the transporter, different amino acids were replaced individually with Cys in Cys-free PutP. Analysis of Na+-coupled proline uptake revealed that the substitution of Ile-3, Thr-5, Ala-12, Ser-28, Leu-37, Phe-45, Ser-54, Ser-71, Glu-75, Ile-80, or Lys-91 by Cys has no or only little effect on the initial rates of proline transport (>70% of the Cys-free PutP value) and the steady-state levels of proline accumulation (>75% of the Cys-free PutP value) (Fig. 4).

Cartilage consists of a sparse array of cells (chondrocytes) distributed within an extracellular matrix of macromolecules that they secrete. Polyanionic proteoglycans are trapped within a network of collagen fibers, and these serve to attract and organize water molecules to form a viscoelastic gel that provides tissue resilience and compressibility. The major proteoglycan within cartilage is the large aggregating proteoglycan, aggrecan. This consists of a central protein core (250–300 kDa) that is substituted with the glycosaminoglycans, keratan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate. Up to 50 KS1 chains can be present, most of which are clustered together in a KS-rich domain close to the N terminus of the protein core (1Hascall V.C. Riolo R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 4529-4538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Heinegård D. Axelsson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1971-1979Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentration of keratan sulfate in human cartilage increases markedly during maturation, but it continues to increase throughout life (3Bjelle A. Connect.

This increase is mostly due to the decrease in aggrecan size that occurs during aging (7Bayliss M.T. Venn M. Maroudas A. Holborrow E.J. Studies in Joint Disease. 1.

Arthritis Rheum. 1990; 20: 12-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar), which results in a proteoglycan containing proportionally more keratan sulfate. This may be partly due to the KS chains themselves increasing in size (10Santer V. White R.J. Roughley P.J. Biochim. Biophys.

Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 198: 439-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Other research has suggested that the level of sulfation of KS increases during normal aging, although these investigations were not extensive and did not provide any details of the structural changes occurring in the glycosaminoglycan (13Kaplan D. Meyer K. Nature. 1959; 182: 1267-1268Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 14Greiling H. Baumann G. Vogel H.G. Connective Tissue and Ageing.

It is now apparent that catabolic products of aggrecan can be detected in serum in the process of cartilage breakdown, and these may be important for the early diagnosis of degenerative joint disease. Several groups have demonstrated that osteoarthritic patients have significantly higher levels of KS in both serum (16Thonar E.J.-M.A. Lenz M.E. Klintworth G.K. Caterson B. Pachman L.M. Glickman P.

However, other studies have recorded no change in the circulating and synovial fluid concentrations of KS in osteoarthritic patients (22Fawthrop F. Yaqub R. Belcher C. Bayliss M. Ledingham J. Doherty M. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1997; 56: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 23Spector T.D. Woodward L. Hall G.M. Hammond A. Williams A. Butler M.G. James I.T. Hart D.J. Thompson P.W.

The analysis of KS in body fluids has almost invariably been measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with monoclonal antibodies recognizing specific sulfation epitopes. These are likely to be structural features of only a small proportion of the glycosaminoglycan chains, and this, together with the natural heterogeneous expression of osteoarthritis, is probably the main reason for the apparently conflicting published data. The structure of keratan sulfate is based upon a poly-N-acetyllactosamine backbone of Galβ(1–4)GlcNAcβ(1–3) which is almost always sulfated on C(6) of N-acetylglucosamine but to a variable extent on C(6) of galactose (24Bhavanandan V.P. Meyer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 1052-1059Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). KS derived from articular cartilage contains sialic acid (N-acetylneuraminic acid) and fucose as minor structural components. The sialic acid residues can be either α(2–3)- or α(2–6)-linked to galactose and occupy nonreducing terminal positions. Both types are present at the end of the poly-N-acetyllactosamine repeat sequence (25Brown G.M. Huckerby T.N. Morris H.G. Abram B.L. Nieduszynski I.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 4836-4846Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and α(2–3)-NeuAc is found in the linkage region (to protein). The fucose residues are linked α(1–3) to N-acetylglucosamine and occur within the main poly-N-acetyllactosamine repeat (26Tai G. Brown G.M. Morris H.G. Huckerby T.N. Nieduszynski I.A. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar,27Brown G.M. Huckerby T.N. Morris H.G. Nieduszynski I.A. Biochem. J. 1992; 286: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Thus, there are numerous structural aspects of the molecule that could give rise to unique “markers” of normal aging and also specifically reflect abnormal metabolic responses in diseased tissue. In the present study, keratan sulfates have been isolated from aggrecan derived from human articular cartilage of different ages, and their detailed structure has been investigated using 1H NMR spectroscopy and degradative studies. Guanidine hydrochloride (practical grade), benzamidine hydrochloride, N-ethylmaleimide, and sodium borohydride were obtained from Sigma. Caesium chloride, di-sodium EDTA, and 6-amino-hexanoic acid were purchased from BDH Chemicals (Poole, UK). Lithium perchlorate (A.C.S. grade), piperazine, anhydrous hydrazine, and hydrazine sulfate were from Aldrich. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Diphenyl carbamyl chloride-treated trypsin (bovine pancreas, EC3.4.21.4) was purchased from Sigma. Chondroitin ABC lyase (Proteus vulgaris, EC 4.2.2.4) and keratanase II (Bacillus sp.) were obtained from ICN Biomedicals Ltd. (High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, UK). Sepharose CL-6B and Sephadex G-50 (medium grade) were obtained from Pharmacia Fine Chemicals (Uppsala, Sweden). Bio-Gel P2 (fine grade) was from Bio-Rad. The Mono-Q HR 55 (5 × 0.5 mm) column was obtained from Pharmacia. The Bio-Gel TSK 30 XL (30 × 0.78 cm) and Aminex HPX-87H columns were from Bio-Rad. Visking dialysis tubing and Spectrapor 1 membrane (M r cutoff 6000–8000) was purchased from Medicell International (London, UK). Keratan sulfate chains were prepared essentially by the method described by Dickenson et al. (28Dickenson J.M. Huckerby T.N. Nieduszynski I.A. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This involved the extraction of the proteoglycans from comminuted cartilage (from the femoral head, femoral condyle, or patella; see Table I) using 4m guanidine hydrochloride including protease inhibitors followed by associative CsCl density gradient centrifugation. Typically over 95% of the extractable KS was present in the high buoyant density fraction. The proteoglycan aggregate fraction was digested with chondroitin ABC lyase followed by diphenyl carbamyl chloride-treated trypsin and then subjected to gel permeation chromatography on a column of Sepharose CL-6B (114 × 2.6 cm) eluted with 0.5 msodium acetate/10 mm EDTA. Fractions were pooled to give the peptido-glycan fragments 6B1 (i.e. the KS-rich region, typical yield >85% of total KS present). KS chains were subsequently isolated by alkaline borohydride reduction (29Carlson D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 616-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) followed by chondroitin ABC lyase digestion and gel permeation chromatography on a column of Sephadex G-50 (82 × 1.5 cm) eluted with 0.15 m NaCl (typical yield, >90% total KS present). After dialysis against water, the KS chains were recovered by lyophilization and then purified further from any remaining O-linked oligosaccharides (30Lohmander L.S. De Luca S. Nilsson B.

Whenever possible column fractions were pooled identically for each sample to ensure comparability.Table IData for human articular cartilage keratan sulfate samplesAgeCartilage sourceM w of KS chainsyearsNewborn fetal (i)femoral condyle4000Newborn fetal (ii)femoral condyle47005 (i)femoral condyle48505 (ii)femoral condyle58509 (i)femoral condyle67009 (ii)femoral condyle825011tibial plateau and patella640014femoral condyle710018femoral condyle755019 (i)femoral condyle670019 (ii)femoral condyle805023femoral condyle650024femoral condyle630031femoral condyle660038 (i)femoral condyle600038 (ii)femoral condyle645055femoral condyle665085femoral head5700Roman numerals denote separate samples from the cartilage of two different individuals of the same age.Determined by gel permeation chromatography on a calibrated TSK 30 XL column.

Determined by gel permeation chromatography on a calibrated TSK 30 XL column. Estimations of keratan sulfate hydrodynamic size were made using a Bio-Gel TSK 30 XL column (30 × 0.78 cm) as described earlier (31Dickenson J.M. Morris H.G. Nieduszynski I.A. Huckerby T.N. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 190: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Weight-average molecular weights (M w) of keratan sulfates were calculated using the following formula: logMw = 4.588 − (2.128 × K av).V o and V t are 11.4 and 20.0 min, respectively. Fucose and galactose contents and ratios were determined by carbohydrate analysis as described by Taiet al. (26Tai G. Brown G.M. Morris H.G. Huckerby T.N. Nieduszynski I.A. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) using conditions similar to those described by Lohmander (32Lohmander L.S. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 154: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) with post-column derivatization using 2-cyanoacetamide (33Honda S. Takahashi M. Kakehi K. Ganno S. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 113: 130-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Keratan sulfate chains (200 μg) were dissolved in 200 μl of 0.2 m sodium acetate, pH 7.4, and 0.07 units of enzyme were added (equivalent to 1 unit/2.8 mg KS). Digestion was performed at 37 °C for 24 h. These conditions had previously been determined to give a limit digest. The digest was reduced by the addition of 200 μl of 2 mNaBH4/0.1 m NaOH at 45 °C for 24 h. The reaction was terminated by the careful addition of 0.5 mCH3COOH, and the oligosaccharides were desalted on a column of Bio-Gel P2 and lyophilized. The reduced oligosaccharides were subjected to gel filtration on a TSK 30 XL column as described previously. Keratan sulfate chains (100 μg) were dissolved in sodium acetate buffer (100 μl), and 200 microunits enzyme were added. Digestion was performed at 37 °C for 30 h. These conditions had previously been determined to give a limit digest. The pH of the mixture was raised to approximately 7.5 using 2m NH4OH, and 3.8 mg of NaBH4 were added (equivalent to 1 m). Reduction was performed at room temperature for 3 h. The reaction was terminated by the careful addition of 0.5 m CH3COOH, and the oligosaccharides were desalted on a column of Bio-Gel P2 and lyophilized. Approximately 10 μg of the reduced oligosaccharides were chromatographed on a Dionex AS4A-SC column using the procedure of Brownet al. (34Brown G.M. Nieduszynski I.A. Morris H.G. Abram B.L. Huckerby T.N. Block J.A. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Samples were prepared for high field NMR spectroscopy as described previously (38Brown G.M. Huckerby T.N. Nieduszynski I.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 281-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Spectra were determined at either 23 or 55 °C, the chemical shift of the residual HO2H signal varying with temperature. All chemical shifts are quoted relative to internal sodium 3-(trimethylsialyl)-[2H4]propionate at 0.0 ppm. Spectra were reprocessed for presentation using the NMRi software package, NMR1, version 1-3-4, supplied by New Methods Research Inc. (Syracuse, NY). Axes for spectra are in ppm. The hydrodynamic sizes of the human articular cartilage keratan sulfate chains were determined on a TSK 30 XL column previously calibrated using keratan sulfate oligosaccharides (Table I). The results shown in Fig. 1 demonstrate that the KS chains isolated from the two full term fetal (Mw = 4000 and 4700) and 5-year-old (Mw = 4850 and 5850) cartilage samples are significantly smaller in size than those from the older specimens over the age of 9 years old (Mw average = 6750 ± 700). A significant increase in average chain size occurs during adolescence (0–9 years), and although KS preparations from individual adult specimens display a high degree of variability (Mwrange, 5700–8250), the data suggest that over 9 years of age there is little change in KS molecular weight. Several signals in the 1H NMR spectra of keratan sulfates yield information on the level and position (Gal or GlcNAc) of sulfation. The GlcNAc H(1) anomeric resonances occur at ∼4.75 ppm and are known to be sensitive to their immediate sulfation environment (36Thornton D.J. Morris H.G. Cockin G.H. Huckerby T.N. Nieduszynski I.A. Carlstedt I. Hardingham T.E. Ratcliffe A. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). When the galactose residue on the reducing side of the GlcNAc is sulfated the H(1) resonance occurs at ∼4.76 ppm; however, when the galactose is unsulfated the signal occurs at ∼4.74 ppm These shift differences usually give rise to a signal resembling a triplet consisting of two overlapping doublets. In addition, as galactose sulfation increases, a signal at ∼3.97 ppm deriving from the H(5) of a sulfated galactose increases in intensity (37Huckerby T.N. Nieduszynski I.A. Brown G.M. Cockin G.H. Glycoconjugate J. 1991; 8: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, quantitative interpretations based upon the size of this resonance are difficult due to the presence of other underlying resonances. It should be noted that in all preparations of articular cartilage keratan sulfates we have investigated, both human and bovine, no unsulfated N-acetylglucosamine residues have been detected. All of the human KS samples have been analyzed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Representative partial high field spectra of keratan sulfates isolated from full term fetal and 11-, 31-, and 38-year-old human articular cartilage are shown in Fig. 2. It can be seen that the pattern of signals at ∼4.75 ppm varies between samples reflecting differences in galactose sulfation levels. The fetal samples possess the lowest galactose sulfation level (∼20–30%), whereas the 31- and 38-year-old samples are much more highly sulfated (∼70–80%). The 11-year-old sample is intermediate at 50–60%. In general, the samples up to 11 years of age exhibit galactose sulfation levels of 20–50%, whereas those of samples within the 18–85-year-old range are between 60 and 80%. This suggests that galactose sulfation levels increase during adolescence and early maturation and then remain fairly constant. However, it is also possible that KS chains with increased galactose sulfation levels have a longer half-life than their less sulfated counterparts and that this apparent increase in sulfation of the KS population as a whole reflects the faster turnover of fetal-type chains. The H(1) and H(6) protons of α(1–3)-linked fucose occur as doublet resonances at ∼5.12 and ∼1.17 ppm, respectively (37Huckerby T.N. Nieduszynski I.A. Brown G.M. Cockin G.H. Glycoconjugate J. 1991; 8: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These signals occur within regions of the1H NMR spectrum free of other KS signals and so tend to be clearly visible if present. Examination of the 1H NMR spectra of the human keratan sulfates reveals the presence of α(1–3)-linked fucose in all of the samples; however, the degree of substitution varies considerably. It is evident that the fetal KS samples contain the lowest amount of this component (0.1% w/w, determined by carbohydrate analysis) with a H(1) doublet resonance only just visible in the 1H spectrum at ∼5.12 ppm (Fig. 2 a). Similarly, all the KS samples up to 11 years old (Fig. 2 b) also contain markedly lower levels of fucose (0.1–0.4% w/w) than the other human samples studied from the older ages (18–85 years old), which generally contain fucose at the ∼1.5% level (Fig. 2 c). The most notable exception is that isolated from a 38-year-old (sample (i)), which contains a much higher level at 2.7% (Fig. 2 d). Clearly, the fucose content of human articular cartilage keratan sulfates increases during adolescence. During subsequent aging, KS chains from most adult individuals have similar fucose contents; however, there are exceptions, and some samples show a markedly different composition, the cause of which is unknown. The H(3ax) and H(3eq) protons of α(2–3)-linked sialic acid give rise to characteristic resonances at ∼1.80 and 2.77 ppm, respectively, whereas those slightly further upfield at ∼1.70 and 2.70 ppm derive from sialic acid that is α(2–6)-linked. Although quantitative interpretations of these signals are difficult due to the complexity of the overlapping resonances, careful analysis of high field spectra can identify the presence (or absence) of sialic acid in a discrete environment. Table II gives details of the sialic acid H(3ax) and H(3eq) proton chemical shifts in the several sialic acid-containing environments identified for bovine articular cartilage keratan sulfates occurring as either capping sequence or linkage region oligosaccharides (38Brown G.M. Huckerby T.N. Nieduszynski I.A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 224: 281-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).Table IIChemical shifts of the H(3ax) and H(3eq) protons of sialic acid in various environments in keratan sulfatesSialic acid environmentNeuAc H(3ax)NeuAc H(3eq)δ ppmNeuAcα(2–3)Galβ(1–4)GlcNAc(6S)β(1–3)Galβ1-1.8052.760NeuAcα(2–3)Galβ(1–4)GlcNAc(6S)β(1–3)Gal(6S)β1-1.8072.758NeuAcα(2–3)Gal(6S)β(1–4)GlcNAc(6S)β(1–3)Gal(6S)β1-1.8142.754NeuAcα(2–3)Gal in the linkage region1.7962.789NeuAcα(2–6)Galβ(1–4)GlcNAc(6S)β(1–3)Gal(6S)β1-1.7052.694Chemical shift at 55 °C.Chemical shift at 60 °C. Open table in a new tab Chemical shift at 55 °C. Chemical shift at 60 °C. Examination of the 1H NMR spectra of the human keratan sulfate samples (Fig. 3) reveals the presence of sialic acid in several environments. It is apparent that the fetal KS samples contain no detectable α(2–6)-linked sialic acid and that the level of α(2–3)-linked sialic acid is much lower than in the other human samples studied (Fig. 3 a). This finding is surprising because these samples might have been expected to contain proportionally more sialic acid than those from the older ages because the hydrodynamic size of the chains appears to be much smaller (Mw = 4000 and 4700). Analysis of the α(2–3)-linked sialic acid signals at ∼1.8 ppm indicates the presence of at least two environments. The major component at 1.805 ppm corresponds to sialic acid in the capping sequence NeuAcα(2–3)Galβ1–4GlcNAc(6S)β1-, whereas the minor component (at 1.794 ppm) represents the α(2–3)-linked sialic acid in the linkage region. The highly sulfated cap, NeuAcα(2–3)Gal(6S)β1–4GlcNAc(6S)β1-, is not detectable in the1H NMR spectrum of fetal KS, presumably due to the low level of sulfation within these samples. The 5-year-old samples also contain no detectable α(2–6)-linked sialic acid; however, the α(2–3)-linked sialic acid content is broadly equivalent with that found in most of the older samples (Fig. 3 b). The 9- and 11-year-old samples also contain little if any α(2–6)-linked sialic acid, although levels of α(2–3)-linked sialic acid are normal. The remainder of the human samples all demonstrate the presence of five sialic acid environments summarized in Table II, with the sequence NeuAcα(2–3)Gal(6S)β1–4GlcNAc(6S)β1- as the dominant structure (Fig. 3, c and d), although the relative proportions vary considerably, particularly the α(2–6)-linked sialic acid content. Four human keratan sulfate samples (namely 19(i)-, 24-, 38(i)-, and 85-year-old) containing similar galactose sulfation levels as judged by NMR spectroscopy were digested with keratanase (an endo-β-galactosidase) to assess the size of the fully sulfated block structures. Examination of the gel permeation chromatograms shown in Fig. 4 indicates considerable variation in the pattern of enzyme digestion. It can be seen that the sample from the 19-year-old is relatively resistant to degradation by the enzyme, resulting in a relatively high proportion of large oligosaccharides. This has two potential implications for the detailed microstructure of the chains. Either the sample possesses a large proportion of fully sulfated blocks, possibly separated by keratanase-sensitive oligosaccharide sequences possessing low galactose sulfation, or it contains a high proportion of fucose residues that are known to inhibit the action of the enzyme (39Tai G. Huckerby T.N. Nieduszynski I.A. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Providing that the fucose is evenly distributed within the repeat sequence, the latter hypothesis can be discounted because this sample contained a fucose content (1.4%) similar to that in the 24- and 85-year-old samples (1.3 and 1.5%, respectively), which were fragmented to a much greater extent (Fig. 4, b and d). By contrast, the sample from the 38-year-old (Fig. 4 c) produced a larger quantity of smaller oligosaccharides, suggesting that galactose sulfation is more evenly distributed within the keratan sulfate chains. The detailed structures of all the human samples were analyzed using the keratanase II/Dionex anion exchange chromatography oligosaccharide profiling technique described by Brown et al. (34Brown G.M. Nieduszynski I.A. Morris H.G. Abram B.L. Huckerby T.N. Block J.A. Glycobiology. 1995; 5: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It can be seen from the comparison of partial chromatograms shown in Fig. 5that these analyses confirm those obtained by NMR spectroscopy regarding the age-related increases in the proportions of α(2–3)- and α(2–6)-linked sialic acid and α(1–3)-fucose. Interestingly, oligosaccharide profiling of one of the fetal samples (Fig. 6) reveals that almost all of the fucose and sialic acid is present in the capping structure NeuAcα(2–3)Galβ(1–4)GlcNAc(6S)β(1–3)Galβ(1–4)[Fucα(1–3)]GlcNAc(6S)-ol (i.e. a sulfated VIM-2 epitope; (40Brown G.M. Huckerby T.N. Abram B.L. Nieduszynski I.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)). This is surprising because the fucose content is low in this sample, and this structure is only present at very low levels in all the other KS samples studied from the older cartilages. The significance of this finding is not yet understood; however, it is possible that such antigens may be important in the early stages of tissue development (41Feizi T. Greiling H. Scott J.E. Keratan Sulfate: Chemistry, Biology, Chemical Pathology. The Biochemical Society, London1989: 21-29Google Scholar).Figure 6Dionex AS4A-SC anion exchange chromatogram of oligosaccharides produced by keratanase II digestion/borohydride reduction of keratan sulfates from human fetal (full term, sample (i)) cartilage.

It is clear that the fetal KS samples are significantly different from those isolated from older cartilages. The analytical data show that (i) the sulfation level on galactose is low (∼20–30%); (ii) the fucose content is very low (0.1% w/w); (iii) α(2–3)-sialylation is low; and (iv) α(2–6)-sialylation is absent. In addition, the 1H NMR spectrum of one of the fetal KS samples displays a doublet resonance at ∼4.98 ppm (Fig. 5 a) that is not present in any other human sample studied. Although the origin of this signal is unknown, it clearly derives from the anomeric proton of an α-linked sugar (the coupling constant is small, ∼3 Hz). This resonance has been seen before on the1H NMR spectra of keratan sulfates isolated in this laboratory from very young bovine articular cartilage (36Thornton D.J. Morris H.G. Cockin G.H. Huckerby T.N. Nieduszynski I.A. Carlstedt I. Hardingham T.E. Ratcliffe A. Biochem. J. 1989; 260: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) but has not yet been identified. It is possible that this fetal-specific feature represents an alternative to sialic acid as a chain cap (quite possible considering the relative deficiency of sialic acid caps in this sample), and the Dionex fingerprint of this sample did reveal the presence of several minor unknown peaks (data not shown). The KS samples from all of the younger cartilages studied (5–11 years old) also display significant differences from those derived from older material. The α(2–6)-linked sialic acid is either not present or present at very low levels, and the fucose content is very low (0.1–0.4% w/w). The sulfation level on galactose (∼30–50%) is generally intermediate between that in the fetal samples and that in the older samples. From the results presented here, the aging process has several implications for the detailed structure of human articular cartilage keratan sulfates (Scheme FS1) and can be divided into three stages: birth to early adolescence (0–9 years), maturation (9–18 years), and adulthood (18–85 years) (Table III).Table IIIDevelopmental changes that occur in human keratan sulfatesStageCharacteristicsBirth to early adolescence (0–9 years)i. The levels of fucosylation and galactose sulfation increase.ii. The molecular weight of the KS chains increases significantly.iii. α(2–3)-linked sialic acid content increases.Maturation (9–18 years)i.

Open table in a new tab The functions of sialic acid and fucose in keratan sulfates are still not clear. It is possible that sialic acid residues, present as chain caps, have significance for chain degradation. Sialic acid masks the galactose residue to which it is attached, preventing the removal of the glycoprotein from the circulation via Gal-specific receptors on the cell surface of hepatocytes (42Ashwell G. Morell A.G. Adv. Enzymol. 1974; 41: 99-128PubMed Google Scholar). Removal of the sialic acids by sialidases causes the rapid removal of the glycoprotein from the circulation. It is possible that the sialic acid chain caps in KS, present in several discrete environments, dictate the lifetime of these molecules. At present, nothing is known about the rates of removal of α(2–3)- versus α(2–6)-linked sialic acid glycoproteins and glycosaminoglycans in serum. The presence of fucose may also have potential significance for the degradation of the molecules. Studies using the KS degrading enzymes keratanase and keratanase II have shown that fucose residues in the vicinity of susceptible glycosidic bonds inhibit cleavage (39Tai G. Huckerby T.N. Nieduszynski I.A. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). 2K. M. Whitham, unpublished results. If glycosidases responsible for the breakdown of KS in vivo also possess this substrate specificity, fucosylated chains may be less susceptible to degradation. The interest in keratan sulfate study has been partially stimulated by the possible assay of these molecules in the early diagnosis of arthritic diseases and in the monitoring of cartilage catabolism. It is known that the degradation of proteoglycans occurs early in joint damage (43Dingle J.T. Horsfield P. Fell H.B. Barratt M.E.J. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1975; 34: 303-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and that fragments are released into the synovial fluid and subsequently the serum (44Heinegård D. Inerot S. Weislander J. Lindblad G. Scand. J. Clin. Lab. Invest. 1985; 45: 421-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 45Ratcliffe A. Doherty M. Maini R.N. Hardingham T.E. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1988; 47: 826-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The quantitation of keratan sulfates in both serum and synovial fluid has therefore been proposed as a measure of cartilage breakdown. Currently, most measurements involve an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay approach using the anti-KS antibodies, 5D4 and MZ15, which recognize fully sulfated blocks of hexasaccharide size and larger (46Mehmet H. Scudder P. Tang P.W. Hounsell E.F. Caterson B. Feizi T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1986; 157: 385-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The results obtained from keratanase analysis of the KS chains show that even in samples where the overall galactose sulfation levels are similar, considerable variation in the distribution of sulfate groups can occur within the poly-N-acetyllactosamine repeat sequence. This has considerable significance for their study and quantitation by these monoclonal antibodies. It is clear that for the samples studied here, the KS chains from the 19-year-old would bind to these antibodies much more strongly than those from the 38-year-old. It is clear that new quantitative techniques for the assay of KS concentration need to be developed if keratan sulfate is to be used as an accurate measure of cartilage breakdown. The identification of oligosaccharide sequences unique (or present in high abundance) to KSs in high load-bearing areas may be important to this goal. The lesions leading to osteoarthritis are known to appear first in the most highly loaded areas of the cartilage surface (47Helminen H.J. Helminen H.J. Kiviranto I. Säämänen A.-M. Tammi M. Paukkonen K. Jurvelin J. Joint Loading. Wright, 1987: 29Google Scholar), and it is possible that “load-related epitopes” could be present in high concentrations in synovial fluid (and possibly blood) of patients with arthritic disease. At Lancaster, studies are now in progress to identify such load-related epitopes and determine whether they are present in keratan sulfates and whether their detection and quantitation can be used to monitor cartilage loading and hence breakdown of the extracellular matrix. The discovery that both α(1–3)-linked fucose and α(2–6)-linked sialic acid are present only in articular (i.e. load-bearing) cartilage keratan sulfates (48Nieduszynski I.A. Huckerby T.N. Dickenson J.M. Brown G.M. Tai G. Morris H.G. Eadie S. Biochem. J. 1990; 271: 243-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) and that their proportions change significantly during adolescence at a time when extensive cartilage remodelling is occurring suggests that putative load-related epitopes may contain one or more of these structures. Tai Guihua, Bob Lauder, and Haydn Morris are thanked for helpful discussions."

Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1467-1473Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). These results have been explained by the facts that in the presence of PFT inhibitors, K-Ras and N-Ras become geranylgeranylated instead of farnesylated in cells (30Whyte D.B. Kirschmeier P.

By using selective PFT and PGGT-I inhibitors, FTI-277 and GGTI-298, Vogt and co-workers (31Vogt A. Qian Y. McGuire T.F. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1991-1999PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that protein geranylgeranylation but not farnesylation is critical for cell cycle progression from G0/G1 to S phase in mouse 3T3 cells. Possible reasons for the ability of PGGT-I inhibitors to block mammalian cell growth have been proposed (32Vogt A. Sun J. Qian Y. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. J. Biol.

This is based on the observation that proteins in these parasites become radiolabeled when cells are cultured in the presence of radiolabeled mevalonic acid (MVL), the universal precursor of prenyl groups. None of these prenylated parasite proteins have been identified, but a major group includes those of molecular mass of ∼25 kDa, which is typical of small GTP-binding proteins that belong to the Ras superfamily of regulatory proteins.

These parasite proteins have double cysteine C-terminal motifs (DSCC, GGCC, CAC) that are typical of the mammalian motifs that are recognized by protein geranylgeranyltransferase-II (18Farnsworth C.C. Seabra M.C. Ericsson L.H. Gelb M.H. Glomset J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11963-11967Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar).In the present study, we have purified PFT from insect stage (procyclic) T. brucei to near homogeneity. Since the sequences of CaaX-containing farnesyl acceptors from Trypanosomatids are not known, we prepared a mixtures of CaaX-containing peptides in order to find one that has high affinity for T. brucei PFT. Such a peptide formed the basis for affinity chromatography of the parasite enzyme, which was a key step in the overall ∼60,000-fold purification. Photoaffinity radiolabeling of T. brucei PFT with a FPP photoprobe analog clearly identifies the T. brucei homolog of the mammalian PFT β-subunit. We also found that CaaX mimetic-based inhibitors of mammalian PFT are also inhibitors of T. bruceiPFT. Unlike mammalian cells, sub to low micromolar concentrations of PFT inhibitors are lethal to cultured Trypanosomatids. The development of inhibitors of mammalian PFT is an advanced area of medicinal chemistry, and the CaaX substrate specificity of T. brucei PFT is very different from that of the mammalian enzyme (36Yokoyama K. Lin Y. Stuart K.D. Gelb M.H. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 87: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). These results suggest that trypanosomatid PFT is an ideal target for the development of chemotherapeutics. The attachment of the 15-carbon farnesyl group or the 20-carbon geranylgeranyl group to proteins, termed protein prenylation, was described for mating factor peptides from fungi (1Sakagami Y.

Evidence is mounting that protein prenyl groups not only anchor proteins in membranes, possibly by insertion of the prenyl group into the membrane, but also that they are recognized as molecular handles by other proteins (10Marshall C.J.

To date, three enzymes have been identified in mammals and yeast that attach prenyl groups to proteins (13Yokoyama K. Goodwin G.W. Ghomashchi F. Glomset J. Gelb M.H. Biochem. Soc.

Protein farnesyltransferase (PFT)1 catalyzes the transfer of the farnesyl group from FPP to the cysteine residue in the C-terminal motif CaaX, where C is cysteine, a is usually but not necessarily an aliphatic residue, and X is glutamine, serine, methionine, and probably a limited number of other residues (15Reiss Y. Goldstein J.L. Seabra M.C. Casey P.J. Brown M.S. Cell. 1990; 62: 81-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar). PGGT-I transfers the geranylgeranyl group from GGPP to the cysteine of the C-terminal motif Caa(L/F) (16Moomaw J.F. Casey P.J. J. Biol.

Finally, protein geranylgeranyltransferase-II (also known as Rab geranylgeranyltransferase) attaches two geranylgeranyl groups to proteins with C-terminal sequences CCXX, CXC, and CC (18Farnsworth C.C.

PFT and PGGT-I are heterodimeric enzymes that consist of a common α-subunit and of distinct β-subunits (19Seabra M.C. Reiss Y. Casey P.J. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

Protein geranylgeranyltransferase-II activity requires a catalytic core composed of two unique subunits and also a third component called Rep that presents the Rab protein to the catalytic core (22Seabra M.C.

There is considerable interest in protein prenyltransferase inhibitors because it has been shown that selective inhibition of PFT efficiently suppresses transformation induced by oncogenic forms of Ha-Ras that are farnesylated (26James G.L.

However, cells transformed by oncogenic K-Ras, which is also normally farnesylated, as well as normal cells show relatively much less sensitivity to PFT inhibitors (28James G.L. Goldstein J.L.

These results have been explained by the facts that in the presence of PFT inhibitors, K-Ras and N-Ras become geranylgeranylated instead of farnesylated in cells (30Whyte D.B. Kirschmeier P.

https://openalex.org/W2043619303,"Although the effects of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) have been studied primarily in adipocytes and liver, the wide distribution of these receptors suggests that they might also play a role in other cell types. We present evidence that PPAR activators stimulate the expression of the prolactin gene in pituitary GH4C1 cells. Transfection assays in non-pituitary HeLa cells showed that stimulation of the prolactin promoter by PPARα requires the presence of the transcription factor GHF-1 (or Pit-1). Proximal promoter sequences confer responsiveness to PPARα, and activation by this receptor is lost concomitantly with the response to GHF-1. Surprisingly, expression of the retinoid X receptor (RXR) abolishes stimulation by PPARα. Furthermore, the promoter region that confers PPARα responsiveness does not contain a PPAR response element. This suggests that the transcriptional effect of PPARα might be mediated by protein-protein interactions rather than by binding of PPAR/RXR to the promoter. A direct interaction between PPARα and GHF-1 was confirmed by in vitro binding studies. Expression of the coactivators SRC-1 and CREB-binding protein, which bind to PPAR, also enhanced the responsiveness of the prolactin promoter to PPARα. Furthermore, CREB-binding protein also significantly increased activation by GHF-1, and both proteins associated in vitro. Thus, PPARα, a receptor that normally acts as a ligand-dependent transcription factor by binding to specific DNA sequences in one context, can also stimulate the prolactin promoter by association with GHF-1 and coactivator proteins. Although the effects of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) have been studied primarily in adipocytes and liver, the wide distribution of these receptors suggests that they might also play a role in other cell types. We present evidence that PPAR activators stimulate the expression of the prolactin gene in pituitary GH4C1 cells. Transfection assays in non-pituitary HeLa cells showed that stimulation of the prolactin promoter by PPARα requires the presence of the transcription factor GHF-1 (or Pit-1). Proximal promoter sequences confer responsiveness to PPARα, and activation by this receptor is lost concomitantly with the response to GHF-1. Surprisingly, expression of the retinoid X receptor (RXR) abolishes stimulation by PPARα. Furthermore, the promoter region that confers PPARα responsiveness does not contain a PPAR response element. This suggests that the transcriptional effect of PPARα might be mediated by protein-protein interactions rather than by binding of PPAR/RXR to the promoter. A direct interaction between PPARα and GHF-1 was confirmed by in vitro binding studies. Expression of the coactivators SRC-1 and CREB-binding protein, which bind to PPAR, also enhanced the responsiveness of the prolactin promoter to PPARα. Furthermore, CREB-binding protein also significantly increased activation by GHF-1, and both proteins associated in vitro. Thus, PPARα, a receptor that normally acts as a ligand-dependent transcription factor by binding to specific DNA sequences in one context, can also stimulate the prolactin promoter by association with GHF-1 and coactivator proteins. peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors PPAR response element retinoid X receptor direct repeat estrogen response element prostaglandin chloramphenicol acetyltransferase thymidine kinase estrogen receptor glutathioneS-transferase polymerase chain reaction transcription factor estradiol CREB binding-protein TATA-binding protein. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs)1 are nuclear receptors that belong to the same subfamily as the thyroid hormone, vitamin D3, and retinoid receptors (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C.

To date, three different PPARs, named PPARα, PPARβ, and PPARγ, have been identified in mammalian cells. Like other nuclear receptors, PPARs regulate transcription by binding to PPAR response elements (PPREs) normally present in the promoter of their target genes. PPREs are composed of direct repeats (DRs) of the consensus motif AGGTCA separated by 1 nucleotide (a DR1 motif) (2Keller H. Whali W. Trends Endocrinol.

To recognize the PPRE, PPAR must heterodimerize with the 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor RXR (4Gearing K.L. Gottlicher M. Teboul M. Widmark E. Gustaffson J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

It has been additionally shown that the PPAR/RXR heterodimer can also recognize palindromic response elements containing the AGGTCA half-sites, although only an estrogen response element (ERE) in which the palindromic sequence is separated by 3 nucleotides can function as a PPRE (10Keller H. Givel F. Perroud M. Whali W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 794-804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Ligand-dependent transcriptional activation by PPAR involves binding of coactivator proteins to the C-terminal receptor region (11DiRenzo J. Södeström M. Kurokawa R. Ogliastro M.-H. Ricote M.

Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 779-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (908) Google Scholar), although activation by protein-protein interactions in the absence of site-specific DNA binding by PPAR have not been demonstrated.Several observations suggest that PPARs play a key role in the regulation of lipid homeostasis and adipocyte differentiation. PPAR-binding sites have been identified in the regulatory region of different genes involved in lipid metabolism, and PPARs are activated by lipid compounds including peroxisome proliferators and fatty acids (7Keller H. Dreyer C. Medin J. Mahfoudi A. Ozato K. Whali W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2160-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 13Dreyer C. Krey G. Keller H. Givel F. Helftenbein G.

The observation that arachidonic acid and its analog 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraynoic acid were strong activators of PPAR activity raised the possibility that arachidonic acid metabolites might serve as PPAR ligands (7Keller H. Dreyer C. Medin J. Mahfoudi A. Ozato K. Whali W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2160-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that prostaglandins (PGs) are endogenous activators of PPARs. The cyclooxygenase product PGD2 and its PGJ2 derivatives are strong activators of PPARα and PPARγ. Furthermore, the PG metabolite 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2 is a high-affinity ligand for PPARγ and promotes adipocyte differentiation (17Forman B.M. Tontonoz P. Chen J. Brun R.P. Spiegelman B.M. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 803-812Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2712) Google Scholar, 18Kliewer S.A. Lenhard J.M. Willson T.M. Patel I. Morris D.C. Lehman J.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 813-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1859) Google Scholar). For these reasons, the role of PPARs in gene regulation has been studied primarily in liver and adipose tissue. However, the PPAR genes are differentially expressed in a wide range of tissues in higher organisms (19Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauça M. Whali W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar), suggesting a widespread role for these receptors. Furthermore, membranes constitute important storage sites for arachidonic acid in all cells. Consequently, PGs can be locally synthesized from arachidonic acid and act as endogenous ligands for cellular PPARs.Although pituitary cells have not been examined for the expression of the different PPAR subtypes, these receptors must be present in significant amounts because incubation of GH4C1 cells (a rat pituitary tumor cell line) with Wy14,643, a potent and selective activator of PPARs, strongly induces transcriptional activity from the PPAR/RXR heterodimer (20Qi J.-S. Desai-Yajnik V. Green M.E. Raaka B.M. Samuels H.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1817-1825Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These cells have been widely used to analyze prolactin gene expression. The prolactin gene is exclusively expressed in the lactotroph cells of the anterior pituitary. Prolactin gene activity is regulated through protein interactions within at least two distinct regions of its 5′-flanking region: a proximal promoter region and a distal enhancer region 1.5 kilobase pairs upstream from the transcription initiation site, both of which contain several binding sites for the pituitary-specific homeodomain protein known as GHF-1 (or Pit-1) (21Bodner N. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 50: 267-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 22Elsholtz H.P. Semin. Reprod.

The prolactin promoter is silent in non-pituitary cells, and expression of GHF-1 strongly stimulates the activity of constructs containing the prolactin 5′-flanking region in transient transfection assays. A well characterized ERE, localized in the distal prolactin enhancer (between nucleotides −1582 and −1568 in the rat gene), confers estradiol responsiveness to the prolactin gene (26Maurer R.A. Notides A.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 4247-4254Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), and the presence of the GHF-1-binding sites in the enhancer is critical not only for enhancer activity, but also for the transcriptional response to estradiol (27Day R.N. Koike S. Sakai M. Muramatsu M. Maurer R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1964-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 28Simmons D.M. Voss J.W. Ingraham H.A. Holloway J.M. Broide R.S. Rosenfeld M.G. Swanson L.W. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 695-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The observation that the ERE is capable of functioning as a PPRE led us to analyze the effect of PPAR and its ligands on prolactin gene expression. Our results show that Wy14,643, PGD2, and, less strongly, PGJ2, increase the levels of prolactin transcripts in GH4C1 cells. Incubation with Wy14,643 also increases the activity of CAT constructs containing the 5′-flanking region of the prolactin gene in pituitary cells. Furthermore, although transfection of PPARα alone does not stimulate the prolactin constructs in non-pituitary HeLa cells, this receptor (but not PPARγ) significantly enhances stimulation by GHF-1. Overexpression of the coactivators SRC-1 and CBP markedly potentiates the response to PPARα. Surprisingly, the PPAR/RXR heterodimers do not bind to the ERE, and the synergistic effect of GHF-1 and PPARα is also observed with constructs containing only the proximal prolactin promoter that do not contain a PPRE. These data indicate that PPARα activates the prolactin promoter by a novel mechanism that involves protein-protein interactions rather than a direct DNA binding. Our results suggest that PPAR could regulate transcription of genes that lack PPAR-binding sites and highlight the importance of this nuclear receptor in pituitary cells.DISCUSSIONPPARs are members of the nuclear receptor superfamily that are primarily involved in the regulation of genes involved in lipid metabolism and play a role in adipocyte differentiation (7Keller H. Dreyer C. Medin J. Mahfoudi A. Ozato K. Whali W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2160-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 13Dreyer C. Krey G. Keller H. Givel F. Helftenbein G.

Cell. 1995; 83: 813-819Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1859) Google Scholar). This work reports that PPARα stimulates rat prolactin gene expression. Incubation of pituitary GH4C1 cells with the PPAR activator Wy14,643 or with prostaglandins increases the levels of prolactin mRNA as well as the activity of the prolactin promoter in transient transfection assays. These results extend the action of PPARα to a cell type different from those normally considered as PPAR targets and to a gene different from those involved in lipid metabolism and homeostasis. Our findings, as well as the very recent finding that PPARγ is a negative regulator of macrophage activation (47Ricote M. Li A.C. Willson T.M. Kelly C.K. Glass C.K. Nature. 1998; 391: 79-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (3241) Google Scholar) and inhibits production of monocyte inflammatory cytokines (48Jiang C. Ting A.T. Seed B. Nature. 1998; 391: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), suggest that these receptors may play a wide role in different biological processes.We have analyzed the functional relationship between the PPARs and the pituitary-specific transcription factor GHF-1 in the regulation of prolactin gene expression in non-pituitary HeLa cells. The overall results provide evidence that both factors act in concert to activate the prolactin promoter. Furthermore, whereas GHF-1 was sufficient to activate the prolactin promoter in HeLa cells, activation by PPARα was observed only when GHF-1 was present. This regulation is isoform-specific because PPARα, but not PPARγ, was able to activate the promoter. The requirement of GHF-1 for PPARα-mediated stimulation of the prolactin gene is similar to that previously observed for the action of other nuclear receptors in the expression of several pituitary genes. It has been previously described that GHF-1 is required for estrogen responsiveness of the prolactin gene (27Day R.N. Koike S. Sakai M. Muramatsu M. Maurer R.A. Mol. Endocrinol. 1990; 4: 1964-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 28Simmons D.M. Voss J.W. Ingraham H.A. Holloway J.M. Broide R.S. Rosenfeld M.G. Swanson L.W. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 695-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar), for retinoic acid response of the GHF-1 gene enhancer (49Rhodes S.J. Chen R. DiMattia G.E. Scully K.M. Kalla K.A. Lin S.-C., Yu, V.C. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 913-932Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), and for activation of the growth hormone promoter by retinoids and thyroid hormones (50Sanchez-Pacheco A. Peña P. Palomino T. Güell A. Castrillo J.L. Aranda A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 422: 103-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 51Schaufele F. West B.L. Baxter J.D. Mol. Endocrinol. 1992; 6: 656-665PubMed Google Scholar).In contrast with the stimulatory effect of the PPAR activators in pituitary cells, PPARα caused a constitutive stimulation of the prolactin promoter in HeLa cells. This finding raises the possibility that HeLa cells might contain endogenous ligands for PPARα that permit activation of the prolactin promoter by this receptor. This possibility is consistent with the marked increase in basal expression from a PPRE-containing promoter observed in HeLa cells transfected with a PPARα expression vector. A significant activator-independent transcriptional stimulation by PPARα has been described before in these cells (10Keller H. Givel F. Perroud M. Whali W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 794-804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Sher T. Yi H.-F. MacBride O.W. Gonzalez F. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5598-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Other cell types have been recently shown to contain activating ligands for PPARγ since whole-cell lysates cause recruitment of coactivator proteins to the ligand-dependent activation function (AF-2) located in the C-terminal domain of the protein (11DiRenzo J. Södeström M. Kurokawa R. Ogliastro M.-H. Ricote M. Ingrey S. Hörlein A. Rosenfeld M.G. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2166-2176Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have found that SRC-1 and CBP, which interact with PPARs in a ligand-dependent manner, strongly potentiate the stimulation of the prolactin promoter by PPARα in HeLa cells. However, contribution of the ligand-independent transcriptional activation function (AF-1) located in the A/B domain of the receptor to the activation of prolactin gene expression by PPARα cannot be ruled out.Binding of PPAR/RXR heterodimers to PPREs represents the mechanism thus far demonstrated for the activation of target genes by PPARs. The role of RXR is to serve as a heterodimer partner to increase the affinity of PPAR and other nuclear receptors for their DNA-binding sites and to permit their transcriptional effects (1Mangelsdorf D.J.

However, RXR actually antagonized the ability of PPARα to potentiate GHF-1 action on the prolactin gene. Furthermore, it has been shown that, unlike other heterodimers, PPAR/RXR heterodimers are permissive for transactivation in response to both PPAR and RXR ligands (7Keller H. Dreyer C. Medin J. Mahfoudi A. Ozato K. Whali W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 2160-2164Crossref PubMed Scopus (849) Google Scholar, 9Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M.

Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). As a consequence, 9-cis-retinoic acid or other synthetic RXR ligands can increase the response to PPAR activators or ligands. We observed this type of regulation in cells transfected with a construct containing the PPRE present in the acyl-CoA oxidase promoter. However, 9-cis-retinoic acid did not overcome the inhibitory effect of RXR on the prolactin promoter.The results described above suggest that the positive role of PPARα in the prolactin gene is mechanistically distinct from its regulation of transcription from the PPREs. This hypothesis has been further confirmed by the lack of a PPRE in the prolactin promoter that could mediate regulation by these receptors. Since it has been shown that a ERE can also function as a PPRE and is bound by PPAR/RXR heterodimers (10Keller H. Givel F. Perroud M. Whali W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 794-804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), our first hypothesis was that the ERE present in the prolactin gene was responsible for regulation by PPARα. However, the prolactin ERE did not bind PPARα/RXR heterodimers. In its natural promoter context, the vitellogenin A2 ERE does not allow transcriptional activation by PPARs due to a nonpermissive promoter structure. As a consequence, these receptors inhibit transactivation by ER through competition for ERE binding (10Keller H. Givel F. Perroud M. Whali W. Mol. Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 794-804Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our gene model, this is not the case since PPARα does not antagonize the effect of ER, but rather cooperates with ER to stimulate the prolactin promoter. Furthermore, PPARα was able to significantly stimulate the effect of GHF-1 on constructs that contain only the proximal prolactin promoter, without typical direct binding of PPARα to DNA.In addition to the consensus mechanism involving binding to their response elements, the nuclear receptors can potentially stimulate or repress gene expression through protein-protein interactions with other nuclear factors. A number of proteins have recently been described to interact with nuclear hormone receptors. Whereas some of them interact in a ligand-dependent manner and function as coactivators or corepressors of the receptors (52Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar, 53Horwitz K.B. Jackson T.A. Bain D.L. Richer J.K. Takimoto G.S. Tung L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1167-1177Crossref PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar), others may associate with the receptors in a ligand-independent manner. The requirement of GHF-1 for the response conferred by PPAR and the finding that regulation by PPARα was lost concomitantly with GHF-1 promoter responsiveness suggest a direct interaction between these two proteins. Our results demonstrate that indeed they associate in vitro. We have previously observed that GHF-1 interacts with other nuclear receptors, including a strong association with RXR and a weaker association with thyroid hormone receptors (43Palomino, T., Sanchez-Pacheco, A., Peña, P., and Aranda, A. (1998) FASEB J., in pressGoogle Scholar). The inhibitory effect of RXR could reflect sequestration of PPARα by formation of PPAR/RXR heterodimers that do not bind to the prolactin promoter, and in agreement with this possibility, we have found that RXR binds to proximal prolactin promoter sequences and that PPARα abolishes this binding. However, if the association between PPARα and GHF-1 is involved in the induction of the prolactin promoter, RXR could also inhibit the cooperative effect of these proteins by displacing PPARα from the complex with GHF-1. An alternative model in which RXR competes with PPARα for binding to the proximal promoter region and inhibits expression cannot be dismissed. This model is less likely given the lack of direct PPARα binding to this region, but it is always possible that PPAR uses a still unidentified partner different from RXR for binding to this region.Although the interaction with GHF-1 appears to be necessary for the PPARα action, additional factors likely contribute to this regulation. Thus, in the absence of the Ets-binding sites and of an overlapping cAMP response element present in the proximal prolactin promoter, neither GHF-1 nor PPARα was able to induce activation. In this regard, it is interesting to mention that Ets and GHF-1 also associate in vitro themselves (54Bradford A.P. Wasylyk C. Wasylik D. Gutierrez-Hartmann A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and that the protein CBP/p300, which binds the cAMP response element-binding protein, is a common activator of different signaling pathways including those modulated by nuclear receptors (35Chakravarti D. LaMorte V.J. Nelson M.C. Nakajima T. Juguilon H. Montminy M. Evans R.M. Nature. 1996; 383: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar, 44Kamei Y. Xu L. Heinzel T. Torchia J. Kurokawa R.

Our results show that CBP/p300 may indeed play an important role in prolactin gene expression since this cointegrator strongly enhances transcriptional activation by GHF-1 and acts synergistically with SRC-1 and PPARα to stimulate the prolactin promoter. Furthermore, our results show that CBP interacts both with GHF-1 and c-Ets-1 and are in agreement with a very recent report that confirms the existence of two interacting domains between residues 313 and 452 and between residues 1449–1892 of CBP with Ets (46Yang C. Shapiro L.H. Rivera M. Kumar A. Brindle P.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2218-2229Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). These are also the interacting domains for a variety of transcription factors (55Janknecht R. Hunter T. Nature. 1996; 383: 22-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar).On the prolactin gene, which does not contain binding sites for PPARα, this receptor could be recruited to the promoter because of its direct interaction with GHF-1 and CBP. The PPARα·GHF-1·Ets·CBP complex could be stabilized by the fact that these factors interact with each other. Others coactivators, such as SRC-1, may also be recruited and function together with CBP. Although this model is consistent with our results, we have not directly demonstrated the formation of this multiprotein complex on DNA. The interaction of nuclear receptors with basal transcription factors has been postulated to play a role in the regulation of gene expression (15Issemann I. Green S.

The direct association of CBP and PPARα with basal transcription factors such as TBP or TFIIB may further stabilize binding to the core transcriptional complex and activate transcription.The activation of the prolactin promoter PPARα provides a novel mechanism by which this receptor regulates transcription, acting rather as a coactivator factor than by heterodimeric binding to a PPRE. Future studies showing the functional effects of specific mutations in PPARα that disrupt either interaction with GHF-1 or binding to DNA as well as with GHF-1 mutants that do not bind to PPARα will definitively corroborate this model. If this is so, an important implication of these results is that the role of PPARα in mediating positive transcriptional responses is broader than induction by direct binding to PPAR-binding sites alone and that this receptor could regulate expression of other genes that lack PPAR-binding sites. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs)1 are nuclear receptors that belong to the same subfamily as the thyroid hormone, vitamin D3, and retinoid receptors (1Mangelsdorf D.J. Thummel C.

To date, three different PPARs, named PPARα, PPARβ, and PPARγ, have been identified in mammalian cells. Like other nuclear receptors, PPARs regulate transcription by binding to PPAR response elements (PPREs) normally present in the promoter of their target genes. PPREs are composed of direct repeats (DRs) of the consensus motif AGGTCA separated by 1 nucleotide (a DR1 motif) (2Keller H. Whali W. Trends Endocrinol.

Cytohesin-1, a 46-kDa ARF GEP, contains a central Sec7 domain of 188 amino acids similar in sequence to a region of the yeast Sec7 protein. Cytohesin-1 and its 22-kDa Sec7 domain (C-1 Sec7), synthesized in Escherichia coli, were assayed with recombinant non-myristoylated ARFs and related proteins to compare their GEP activities. Both were effective with native mammalian ARFs 1 and 3. Cytohesin-1 accelerated GTPγS (guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate) binding to recombinant human ARF1 (rARF1), yeast ARF3, and ARD1 (a 64-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding protein containing a C-terminal ARF domain). In contrast, C-1 Sec7 enhanced GTPγS binding to recombinant human ARFs 1, 5, and 6; yeast ARFs 1, 2, and 3; ARD1; two ARD1 mutants that contain the ARF domain; and Δ13ARF1, which lacks the N-terminal α-helix. Neither C-1 Sec7 nor cytohesin-1 increased GTPγS binding to human ARF-like ARL proteins 1, 2, and 3. Thus, ARLs, initially differentiated from ARFs because of their inability to activate cholera toxin, differ also in their failure to interact functionally with C-1 Sec7 or cytohesin-1. As C-1 Sec7 was much less substrate-specific than cytohesin-1, it appears that structure outside of the Sec7 domain is important for ARF specificity. Data obtained with mutant ARF constructs are all consistent with the conclusion that the ARF N terminus is an important determinant of cytohesin-1 specificity.

ADP-ribosylation factors (ARFs)1 are 20-kDa guanine nucleotide-binding proteins initially identified as activators of cholera toxin ADP-ribosyltransferase and now known as critical components in eukaryotic vesicular trafficking pathways (1Rothman J.E.

Mammalian ARFs are grouped into three classes (class I, ARFs 1, 2, 3; class II, ARFs 4, 5; and class III, ARF 6) based on size, gene structure, and sequence identity (3Tsuchiya M. Price S.R.

ARF structure is highly conserved among eukaryotic species, and non-mammalian ARFs of all three classes are known (4Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12327-12330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The ability of ARFs to serve as activators of cholera toxin distinguishes them from a closely related family of ARF-like proteins or ARLs (5Tamkun J.W. Kahn R.A. Kissinger M. Brizuela B.J. Rulka C. Scott M.P. Kennison J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3120-3124Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). An ARF sequence is also found in the 64-kDa ARD1 (6Mishima K. Tsuchiya M. Nightingale M.S. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8801-8807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which is a bifunctional protein that contains an N-terminal GTPase-activating protein domain (7Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The function of ARFs in vesicular transport has been studied most extensively in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi (8Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1023) Google Scholar, 9Schekman R. Orci L. Science. 1996; 271: 1526-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). It is widely agreed that vesicle formation is initiated when activated ARF molecules with GTP bound associate with the cytoplasmic surface of a membrane. ARF-GTP interacts with a specific component (βCOP) of the so-called coatomer protein complex (10Zhao L. Helms J.B. Brügger B. Harter C. Martoglio B. Graf R. Brunner J. Wieland F.T. Proc. Natl Acad.

Accumulation of multiple molecules of ARF plus coatomer results in membrane deformation, budding, and vesicle release after bilayer fusion at the base of the bud (1Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2001) Google Scholar). Since ARF activation of phospholipase D was first reported (11Brown H.A. Gutowski S. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C. Sternweis P.C.

ARF function depends on the regulated alternation between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states. Inactivation by hydrolysis of bound GTP requires the interaction of ARF-GTP with a GTPase-activating protein (15Makler V. Cukierman E. Rotman M. Admon A. Cassel D. J. Biol.

Activation of ARF-GDP results from the replacement of bound GDP by GTP, which is accelerated by guanine nucleotide-exchange proteins or GEPs (19Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D.

ARF GEPs are known to differ in molecular size and sensitivity to inhibition by brefeldin A (BFA), a fungal fatty acid metabolite that causes reversible disruption of Golgi structure and function. The larger molecular forms, which are BFA-sensitive, include a ∼200-kDa GEP purified and cloned from bovine brain (21Morinaga N. Tsai S.-C. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1132: 75-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), is a 46-kDa protein that contains a central Sec7 domain, a phospholipid-binding C-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (amino acids 260–398), and an N-terminal coiled-coil region. Cytohesin-1 may participate in inside-out cell signaling through its interaction with integrins (31Kolanus W. Nagel W. Schiller B. Zeitlmann L. Godar S. Stockinger H. Seed B. Cell. 1996; 86: 233-242Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). All ARF GEPs of known structure contain Sec7 domains. Sec7 is a ∼230-kDa yeast protein identified during characterization of a temperature-sensitive secretion-defective mutant (32Achstetter T. Franzusoff A. Field C. Schekman R. J. Biol.

The Sec7 domain comprises 10 α-helices, including two highly conserved sequence motifs that appear to be essential for GEP activity. Although several ARF GEPs have been cloned and their activities demonstrated, very little is known about the determinants of substrate specificity. We, therefore, compared the activities of full-length cytohesin-1 (46-kDa) and its 22-kDa Sec7 domain (C-1 Sec7) with several ARF and ARL protein substrates. As reported here, cytohesin-1 accelerated GTPγS binding by rARF1, yeast ARF3, and ARD1 only, whereas C-1 Sec7 was effective with a much broader range of ARFs and related proteins. The N terminus of ARF1 was shown to be important for its effective interaction with cytohesin-1. l-α-Phosphatidyl-l-serine, β-NAD+, and agmatine were purchased from Sigma; GTPγS, GDP, and GTP from Boehringer Mannheim; [35S]GTPγS (12.5 mCi/mmol), [3H]GDP (10 Ci/mmol), and [adenine-14C]β-NAD+ from NEN Life Science Products.

Single colonies expressing recombinant proteins were grown overnight at 37 °C in 25 ml of Luria-Bertani medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml), and then added to 500 ml of the same medium. Incubation with 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was started at an A 600 of 0.6 and continued for 2 h. Following incubation of the cell pellet with lysozyme followed by sonication and centrifugation (100,000 ×g, 35 min), the supernatant was applied to a column (2.5 × 200 cm) Ultrogel AcA 54, which was eluted with Buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm NaN3, 200 mm sucrose, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2). Fractions containing ARF activity were pooled and stored at −20 °C. Recombinant cytohesin-1 (B2–1) was prepared as described by Meacci et al. (26Meacci E. Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1745-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To prepare the Sec7 domain (Arg62–Asp249) as a His6 fusion protein, B2–1 cDNA was digested with restriction enzymesKpnI and HindIII. The product was subcloned in plasmid pQE30, which was then integrated into the Escherichia coli M15 host strain carrying the pREP4 repressor plasmid. Single colonies, selected by resistance to ampicillin and kanamycin, were added to 5 ml of Luria-Bertani medium containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) and kanamycin (25 μg/ml), incubated for 3–4 h at 37 °C, and transferred to 100 ml of Luria-Bertani medium containing the same antibiotics. After reaching an A 600 of 0.5, and incubation with 2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 37 °C, cells were harvested for purification of C-1 Sec7 (26Meacci E. Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1745-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). GEP activities of cytohesin-1 and C-1 Sec7 were regularly assayed with a partially purified mixture of native bovine brain ARFs (chiefly ARFs 1 and 3) as basis for comparing activities with other substrates. Procedures for assay of GTPγS binding and GEP activity have been published (28Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3063-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In brief, assays (50 μl) containing ARF (1 μg unless otherwise indicated) in Buffer A, with 40 μg of bovine serum albumin, 10 μg of PS, 0.1 μg each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and soybean and lima bean trypsin inhibitors, 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, cytohesin-1, or C-1 Sec7 (1 μg unless otherwise specified), and 4 μm [35S]GTPγS (2.5 × 106 cpm) were incubated for the indicated time at 37 °C. Samples were then cooled on ice and transferred to nitrocellulose filters followed by an 8-ml wash of the incubation tube, and 4-ml wash of the filter with buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Scintillation counting fluid was added to dried filters before radioassay of bound [35S]GTPγS. Most data are reported as means ± S.E. of values from triplicate assays in a representative experiment. All observations have been replicated at least twice with different preparations of recombinant proteins. hARF (usually 50 pmol) was incubated for 40 min at 37 °C in reaction mixture (50 μl) containing 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm NaN3, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 200 mm sucrose, 10 μg of PS, 40 μg of bovine serum albumin, protease inhibitors as used in binding assays, 1 mm EDTA, 40 mm NaCl, and 4 μm[35S]GTPγS (2.5 × 106 cpm), or [3H]GDP (1.3 × 106 cpm). After addition of 1 mm amounts of the indicated non-radiolabeled nucleotide and 3 mm MgCl2 (final concentration in a total volume of 100 μl), incubation was continued at 37 °C for the indicated time, with or without cytohesin-1 (1 μg) or C-1 Sec7 (1 μg) to determine nucleotide release. Bound [35S]GTPγS or [3H]GDP was quantified as described for the binding assay. K off represents the means ± half the range from two independent experiments with triplicate incubations. The purified recombinant ARF proteins (non-myristoylated) were functional in their ability to stimulate cholera toxin ADP-ribosyltransferase activity. hARF1 and hARF5 required GTP for activity, whereas hARF6 was similarly active with GDP and GTP, presumably due to the presence of tightly bound nucleotide, which did not exchange with that in the medium (data not shown) as had been found previously (42Welsh C.F. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15583-15587Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of GTPγS binding to hARF1 was proportional to the amount of GEP below ∼2.2 pmol and was maximal with ∼23 pmol of C-1 Sec7 or 11 pmol of cytohesin-1 (Fig. 1). GEP activity of both these molecules is relatively low, and data demonstrating GTPγS binding in excess of the amount of GEP present are shown only in Figs. 3, 5, and 8. (Such data for cytohesin-1 are also found in Ref. 26Meacci E. Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1745-1748Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar.) Cytohesin-1 increased GTPγS binding by hARF1 in a time-dependent manner, but had little or no effect on hARF5 or hARF6 (Figs. 2 and 3). hARF1 appeared to be the preferred substrate for cytohesin-1 withK cat/K m of 6.7 ± 3.2 × 104 min−1/m.Figure 3Time course of [35S]GTPγS binding to hARFs 1, 5, and 6 with or without cytohesin-1. 1 μm hARF 1 (A), hARF5 (B), or hARF6 (C) was incubated without (empty squares) or with (closed squares) 0.1 μg of cytohesin-1, for the indicated time as described in Fig. 1.

TheK cat/K m values for ARFs 1, 5, and 6 were, respectively, 2.2 ± 1.2 × 105, 5.4 ± 1.6 × 104, and 3.3 ± 1.1 × 104 min−1/m (Fig. 5). C-1 Sec7 was less substrate-specific than cytohesin-1 and also more efficient in catalyzing nucleotide exchange on hARF1, consistent with the conclusion that structural elements outside of the Sec7 domain contribute to substrate specificity and serve also to restrain catalytic activity. In the absence of GEP, release of GTPγS was faster from hARF5 (K off = 0.108 ± 0.009) than from hARF1 (K off = 0.032 ± 0.003) (Fig. 6). Cytohesin-1 clearly accelerated release from hARF1 (K off = 0.056 ± 0.000) but had minimal effect on hARF5 (K off = 0.144 ± 0.006). C-1 Sec7, on the other hand, increased K off for hARF5 (K off = 0.36 ± 0.036) > hARF1 (K off = 0.115 ± 0.006). There was no release of [35S]GTPγS from hARF6 with or without cytohesin-1 or C-1 Sec7 (Fig. 6). Although cytohesin-1 did not, C-1 Sec7 did accelerate the release of bound GDP from hARF6 (Fig. 7), consistent with its ability to accelerate GTPγS binding (Figs. 4 and 5).Figure 7Effect of cytohesin-1 or C-1 Sec7 on release of [3H]GDP bound to hARF6. hARF6 (50 pmol) was incubated with 4 μm [3H]GDP in the presence of 1 mm EDTA for 1 h at 37 °C. Release of bound [3H]GDP with 1 μg of cytohesin-1 (closed squares) or C-1 Sec7 (closed triangles), or vehicle (open squares) was then determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Bound [3H]GDP at zero time (100%) was 0.4 pmol.

In the absence of PS, cytohesin-1 did not alter GTPγS binding by native ARFs or by recombinant hARF1 and C-1 Sec7 increased binding only 3.3-fold. Both accelerated binding dramatically in the presence of PS (Table I). GTPγS binding to 1 μmhARF1 was significantly less than to 0.4 μm native ARF, despite its higher concentration.Table IEffect of phosphatidylserine on GTPγS binding without and with cytohesin-1 or C-1 Sec7GEP (1 μg)PS (10 μg)GTPγS bound (pmol)hARF1ARFNone01.4 ± 0.431.4 ± 0.11+1.3 ± 0.061.9 ± 0.02Cytohesin-101.6 ± 0.35 (1.1)1.3 ± 0.14 (1.0)+7.3 ± 0.37 (5.6)15 ± 0.72 (7.9)C-1 Sec704.6 ± 0.11 (3.3)2.6 ± 0.29 (1.6)+10 ± 0.39 (7.7)19 ± 0.76 (10)Samples of hARF1 (50 pmol) or native ARF (20 pmol) without or with 10 μg of PS were incubated without or with 1 μg of cytohesin-1 or C-1 Sec7 for 20 min at 37 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are means ± S.E. of values from triplicate assays.In parentheses, binding relative to that with no GEP = 1.0.

In parentheses, binding relative to that with no GEP = 1.0. The experiment was repeated twice, with similar results. The initial rate of GTPγS binding to Δ13ARF1, which lacks the first 13 amino acids and the N-terminal myristate, was markedly increased by C-1 Sec7 (Fig. 8). Cytohesin-1 was, however, without effect (Fig. 8). ARD1 is a 64-kDa protein that contains an 18-kDa C-terminal ARF domain (p3), which is 60% identical to the corresponding sequence of ARF1. The mutant Δ387ARD1 which lacks the first 387 amino acids of ARD1, corresponds to the ARF domain plus a 15-amino acid N-terminal extension. GTPγS binding to ARD1, Δ387ARD1, and p3 was similarly accelerated by C-1 Sec7, although the effects were smaller than that on hARF1 (Table II, Experiment 1). Cytohesin-1 had effects similar to those of C-1 Sec7 on ARD1 and Δ387ARD1 but was without effect on p3, which lacks sequence corresponding to the ARF N terminus that appears to be important for interaction with cytohesin-1.Table IIEffect of cytohesin-1 or C-1 Sec7 on GTPγS binding to ARD1 and related proteinsExperiment no.ARF[35S]GTPγS bound (pmol)proteinNo GEPCytohesin-1C-1 Sec71hARF10.89 ± 0.035.0 ± 0.11 (5.6)6.5 ± 0.16 (7.3)hARD10.35 ± 0.011.3 ± 0.02 (3.7)1.7 ± 0.09 (4.9)p30.30 ± 0.020.29 ± 0.01 (1.0)1.2 ± 0.06 (4.0)Δ387ARD10.35 ± 0.011.4 ± 0.13 (4.0)1.8 ± 0.03 (5.1)2hARF11.3 ± 0.067.3 ± 0.37 (5.6)10.2 ± 0.39 (7.8)yARF13.7 ± 1.54.2 ± 0.07 (1.1)33 ± 0.43 (8.9)yARF23.9 ± 0.305.6 ± 0.38 (1.4)38 ± 1.7 (9.7)yARF37.2 ± 0.7621 ± 0.52 (2.9)33 ± 6.2 (4.6)3hARF10.98 ± 0.143.7 ± 0.21 (3.8)6.2 ± 0.25 (6.3)hARL10.61 ± 0.210.74 ± 0.35 (1.2)0.29 ± 0.09 (0.5)hARL20.36 ± 0.100.30 ± 0.10 (0.8)0.23 ± 0.03 (0.6)hARL33.2 ± 0.884.3 ± 0.88 (1.3)3.6 ± 0.01 (1.1)Samples (20 pmol in Exp. 1, 50 pmol in Exp. 2 and 3) of the indicated ARF protein preparations without or with 1 μg of cytohesin-1 or C-1 Sec7 were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures” except that assays in Exp. 1 contained also cardiolipin (1 mg/ml).

Open table in a new tab Samples (20 pmol in Exp. 1, 50 pmol in Exp. 2 and 3) of the indicated ARF protein preparations without or with 1 μg of cytohesin-1 or C-1 Sec7 were incubated for 20 min at 37 °C as described under “Experimental Procedures” except that assays in Exp. 1 contained also cardiolipin (1 mg/ml). Data are means ± S.E. of values from triplicate assays. In parentheses, binding relative to that with no GEP = 1.0. The experiments were carried out twice with similar results. C-1 Sec7 increased GTPγS binding to yARFs 1 and 2 approximately 9-fold and to yARF3 4-fold (Table II, Experiment 2). Cytohesin-1, which had no effect with yARFs 1 and 2, did significantly increase binding to yARF3, albeit to a lesser degree than did C-1 Sec7 (Table II, Experiment 2). Although ARLs (ARF-like) proteins are very similar to ARFs in size and structure, neither C-1 Sec7 nor cytohesin-1 accelerated GTPγS binding to hARLs 1, 2, or 3 (Table II, Experiment 3). The data reported here establish that C-1 Sec7 can act as a GEP for a variety of ARF-related proteins. Determinants of the much more restricted substrate specificity of cytohesin-1 must, therefore, lie outside of the Sec7 domain. C-1 Sec7 accelerated GTPγS binding to hARFs 1, 5, and 6; yARFs 1, 2, and 3; ARD1 and its ARF domain; and Δ13ARF1 (lacking the first 13 amino acids). Cytohesin-1, on the other hand, was active only with hARF1 (or native class I ARFs), yARF3, ARD1, and Δ387ARD1. Its ability to serve as a GEP for yARF3 was somewhat surprising, as yARF3 is in toto more similar to ARF6 (60% identical) than to any other of the mammalian ARFs (40Lee F.-J.S. Stevens L.A. Kao Y.L. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20931-20937Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). At the N terminus, however, it is not. In the first 12 positions, there are eight differences, including four residues missing in ARF6. Thus, the N terminus of hARF6 differs markedly from that of yARF3, as it does also from the five other mammalian ARFs. hARF1 differs also from yARF3 in 8 of the first 12 positions, but some of those are conservative replacements, and there are no “missing” amino acids so that the N-terminal structure of yARF3 overall probably resembles that of ARF1 more than it does that of hARF6. The failure of ARLs to serve as substrates for cytohesin-1 or its Sec7 domain parallels their relative inability to activate cholera toxin. It may be related to differences in structure of the switch 2 regions (4 of 11 residues different in ARF1 and ARL1), which in ARF is believed to interact with the ARNO Sec7 domain (33Mossessova E. Gulbis J.M. Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 92: 415-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 34Cherfils J. Ménétrey J. Mathieu M. Le Brass G. Robineau S. Béraud-Dufour S. Antonny B. Chardin P. Nature. 1998; 392: 101-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Although there was no release of bound GTPγS from hARF6 without or with cytohesin-1 or C-1 Sec7, the latter did accelerate release of bound [3H]GDP, consistent with its ability to accelerate GTPγS binding by hARF6 (as well as several other ARF-related molecules). The mechanism of action of the ARF GEPs remains to be established. Certain GEPs for other GTPases of the Ras superfamily, however, are believed to act by stabilizing the protein in a nucleotide-free state and the association of ARNO with a nucleotide-free ARF mutant was shown directly by gel filtration (43Paris S. Béraud-Dufour S. Robineau S. Bigay J. Antonny B. Chabre M. Chardin P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22221-22226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The intrinsic rate of GDP release from ARF1 has been reported to range over 2 orders of magnitude depending on the specific phospholipid present, whereas rates of release of GTPγS varied less than 20% (44Terui T. Kahn R.A. Randazzo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28130-28135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the presence of PIP2 for example, the GDP off-rate was 20 times that for GTPγS (44Terui T. Kahn R.A. Randazzo P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28130-28135Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Preferential interaction with the nucleotide-free conformation of hARF6 could be consistent with the effect of C-1 Sec7 on release of bound GDP, but not GTPγS. Cytohesin-1 failed to accelerate GTPγS binding by the ARF domain of ARD1 (p3), which lacks sequence corresponding to the first 15 amino acids of ARF1, and thus resembles Δ13ARF1 (6Mishima K. Tsuchiya M. Nightingale M.S. Moss J. Vaughan M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8801-8807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Vitale N. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1941-1944Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). It did, however, function with Δ387ARD1, which corresponds to p3 with an N-terminal extension of 15 amino acids, demonstrating again the importance of the ARF N terminus in the functional interactions with cytohesin-1. Both of these ARFs with N-terminal deletions were, however, substrates for C-1 Sec7. hARF6, although it does not have such a large deletion, may be another example of an ARF N terminus unsuitable for cytohesin-1 interaction, but functional with C-1 Sec7. Other workers (43Paris S. Béraud-Dufour S. Robineau S. Bigay J. Antonny B. Chabre M. Chardin P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22221-22226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) demonstrated the importance of the ARF N terminus in nucleotide exchange catalyzed by ARNO, which is 82% identical in amino acid sequence to cytohesin-1. Two groups recently reported crystal structures of the ARNO Sec7 domain (33Mossessova E. Gulbis J.M. Goldberg J. Cell. 1998; 92: 415-423Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 34Cherfils J. Ménétrey J. Mathieu M. Le Brass G. Robineau S. Béraud-Dufour S. Antonny B. Chardin P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22221-22226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) had earlier investigated the interactions of intact ARNO or its Sec7 domain with myristoylated ARF1 or Δ17ARF1 (lacking the first 17 amino acids as well as the N-terminal myristate) and the effects of several phospholipids on them. Although GTPγS binding to myristoylated ARF1 in the presence of ARNO was markedly accelerated by the addition of phospholipid vesicles containing PIP2, the phospholipids had no effect on ARNO-catalyzed GTPγS binding to Δ17ARF1. In addition, in the absence of phospholipid, the activities of intact ARNO and its Sec7 domain toward Δ17ARF1 were identical (43Paris S. Béraud-Dufour S. Robineau S. Bigay J. Antonny B. Chabre M. Chardin P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22221-22226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Thus, PIP2 binding to the PH domain of ARNO does not modify its catalytic activity but serves to promote its association with membranes. Similarly, Paris et al. (43Paris S. Béraud-Dufour S. Robineau S. Bigay J. Antonny B. Chabre M. Chardin P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22221-22226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) found that ARF1-GDP was a poor substrate for ARNO in the absence of PIP2 and concluded that binding of PIP2 by both the PH domain of ARNO and the terminal α-helices of ARF is needed to concentrate the two proteins at a membrane surface, thereby facilitating their interaction. Conformational change at the N terminus resulting from interaction of the myristate and/or the α-helix with membrane lipids probably contributes to the release of bound GDP (intrinsic or GEP-catalyzed) and thereby GTP binding. The effect of PS, which was required for cytohesin-1 activity and also enhanced that of C-1 Sec7, is an example of the importance of acidic phospholipids in the action of these ARF GEPs. It differs, however, from the effect of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate on GRP1, which was not seen with the Sec7 domain alone, i.e. it apparently required specifically the PH domain (45Klarlund J.K. Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. Buxton J.M. Holik J.J. Sakelis C. Patki V. Corvera S. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1859-1862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). PH domains from GRP1 and cytohesin-1, but not those from IRS-1 or SOS, specifically bound phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (27Klarlund J.K. Guilherme A. Holik J.J. Virbasius J.V. Chawla A. Czech M.P. Science. 1997; 275: 1927-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Klarlund et al. (45Klarlund J.K. Rameh L.E. Cantley L.C. Buxton J.M. Holik J.J. Sakelis C. Patki V. Corvera S.

Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) concluded that ARNO is a GEP for ARF6, whereas, in the experiments reported here, the effect of cytohesin-1 on ARF6 nucleotide exchange was considerably less than that on ARF1. The conditions used for assays in the two studies were, however, very different. Specific detergents or phospholipids can have major effects; we used PS, and Frank et al. used azolectin. They compared ARNO activities with 1 μm myristoylated ARF1 and ARF6 (although total concentrations of the two ARFs were quite different because the recombinant ARF1 was 20% myristoylated and the ARF6 50%). All of the recombinant ARFs used in our studies were non-myristoylated, which could, of course, have contributed to the low activity of cytohesin; hARF1 was clearly a less effective substrate than the native ARF 1/3 mixture for both cytohesin-1 and C-1 Sec7 (Table I). Because of the dramatic effects of brefeldin A on Golgi structure and function, a GEP that activates ARF for Golgi transport would be expected to be inhibited by BFA. Thus, when BFA sensitivity was apparently lost with purification of an ARF GEP from bovine brain, we had rationalized it as perhaps due to removal of a component that mediated BFA inhibition (28Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3063-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In retrospect, it seems more likely that the ∼55-kDa purified GEP (28Tsai S.-C. Adamik R. Moss J. Vaughan M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 3063-3066Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) is a member of the cytohesin-1/ARNO/GRP1 family of BFA-insensitive GEPs and does not function in anterograde endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi transport. These GEPs, with C-terminal PH domains, may participate in events involving the plasma membrane, as suggested by Frank et al. (46Frank S. Upender S. Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar) or in other of the numerous pathways of bi-directional intracellular membrane trafficking that are even less well understood. Localization of ARF6 with plasma membrane and tubulovesicular structures in the cell periphery had been known and subsequent studies clearly implicated it in endocytosis and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (47Radhakrishna H. Donaldson J.G. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 49-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Demonstration of the similar distribution of ARNO (46Frank S. Upender S. Hansen S.H. Casanova J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23-27Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), as well as its lack of sensitivity to BFA, is consistent, of course, with the suggested role as a GEP for ARF6. Elucidation at a molecular level of the physiological function of individual ARF proteins remains the goal. The development of in vitro assays of GEP activity that will accurately reflect ARF specificity is of major importance, along with improved detection of individual ARFs in intact cells.

The homohexameric protein binds nascent RNA and, with the RNA-dependent hydrolysis of ATP, disrupts the ternary transcription complex, releasing product RNA and allowing RNA polymerase to recycle.

As described by Nudler et al. (7Nudler E. Avetissova E. Markovtsov V. Goldfarb A. Science. 1996; 273: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), the interaction of RNA with RNA polymerase immediately 5′ from the RNA-DNA hybrid may control the opening and closing of an RNA polymerase clamp around the DNA template near the leading edge of the enzyme, and contribute to the stability of the ternary transcription complex. An appealing model for Rho is one in which the enzyme binds to exposed mRNA behind RNA polymerase and travels 5′ → 3′ along the RNA as it hydrolyzes ATP, binding and releasing RNA from different parts of the hexamer to accomplish movement (8Walstrom K.M. Dozono J.M. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7993-8004Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Such activity could release nascent RNA from RNA polymerase-binding sites and could constitute the basis for its RNA-DNA helicase activity, both of which might be involved in transcript release from paused ternary transcription complexes.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7993-8004Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) supports this hypothesis. Rho binds single-stranded RNA, showing preferred entry regions on RNA upstream of eventual transcription termination sites. However, the characteristics of these regions, beyond low secondary structure and some preference for a C-rich, G-poor base composition (9Alifano P. Rivellini F. Limauro D. Bruni C.B. Carlomagno M.S. Cell. 1991; 64: 553-563Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), are too poorly understood to permit their identification by sequence inspection. When bound to RNA, Rho protects 80 bases from ribonuclease degradation (10Galluppi G.R. Richardson J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 138: 513-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 11Bear D.G. Hicks P.S. Escudero K.W. Andrews C.L. McSwiggen J.A. von Hippel P.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 199: 623-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The binding of Rho to 10-base RNA oligomers was reported as best fit by three tight and three weaker sites per hexamer (12Geiselmann J. Yager T.D. von Hippel P.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 861-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 13Wang Y. von Hippel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13947-13955Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The RNA-dependent hydrolysis of ATP is essential for the transcription termination function of Rho. Two components of ternary transcription complexes, the DNA template and RNA polymerase, are not required to elicit this ATPase activity, thus considerably simplifying study of the reaction (14Lowery-Goldhammer C. Richardson J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1974; 71: 2003-2007Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The reaction is particularly well stimulated by the RNA homopolymer poly(C), and Rho is frequently assayed in vitro by measuring its poly(C)-dependent ATPase activity. Previous work has shown that the Rho hexamer binds three molecules of MgATP in a single class of catalytically competent sites (15Stitt B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11130-11137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Geiselmann J. von Hippel P.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 850-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). An additional class of three ATP-binding sites of lower affinity has also been suggested (16Geiselmann J. von Hippel P.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 850-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), although the catalytic activity of these sites was not assessed. The stoichiometry for ATP and RNA oligomer interactions with Rho, together with studies of Rho quaternary structure (17Geiselmann J. Yager T.D. Gill S.C. Calmettes P. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 18Geiselmann J. Seifried S.E. Yager T.D. Liang C. von Hippel P.H.

Biol. 1997; 269: 514-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar), have led to a proposed model of Rho as a trimer of dimers in which adjacent identical subunits may alternate in their ability to bind and hydrolyze ATP and to bind and release RNA (8Walstrom K.M. Dozono J.M. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7993-8004Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 15Stitt B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11130-11137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Geiselmann J. Wang Y. Seifried S.E. von Hippel P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7754-7758Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Our goal is to elucidate the molecular mechanism of Rho activity, including the sequence of ATP and RNA binding, ATP hydrolysis, product release, and interactions with other molecules that sum to transcription termination. Travel in a 5′ → 3′ direction along single-stranded RNA can readily be seen as consistent with the hydrolysis in an ordered sequence of ATP molecules that are bound to Rho, but evidence for such a hydrolysis pattern is lacking. We present the results of rapid mix chemical quench experiments and isotope partitioning studies, which show that hydrolysis of the three bound ATP molecules is sequential. These results also indicate communication among the active sites of Rho. In addition, we show catalytic cooperativity among Rho active sites. Wild type Rho fromE. coli was purified as described (21Mott J.E. Grant R.A. Ho Y.-S. Platt T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 88-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) from strain AR120/A6 containing plasmid p39ASE (22Nehrke K.W. Seifried S.E. Platt T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6107Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The concentration of Rho was spectrophotometrically determined using ε280 nm1% = 3.25 cm−1 (17Geiselmann J. Yager T.D. Gill S.C. Calmettes P. von Hippel P.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 111-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The enzyme preparation used for most experiments had a specific activity with poly(C) at 37 °C of 12–15 units mg−1. Some experiments were repeated with an independent enzyme preparation that had a specific activity of 22–26 units mg−1. These values are in the range of specific activities reported in the literature (10–30 units mg−1). A preparation of Rho E155K with a specific activity at 37 °C of 18 units mg−1 was also used. All Rho preparations appeared >95% pure on Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels. A unit of activity is that amount of enzyme that hydrolyzes 1 μmol of ATP in 1 min. ATPγS1 was from Boehringer Mannheim, and [35S]ATPγS, 1250 Ci/mmol, was from NEN Life Science Products (NEG027H). Radioactive ATPγS was diluted to 42,000 cpm nmol−1 before use. TNP-ATP was synthesized and purified according to Hiratsuka and Uchida (23Hiratsuka T. Uchida K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 320: 635-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). [γ-32P]TNP-ATP was synthesized and purified as described by Grubmeyer and Penefsky (24Grubmeyer C. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3718-3727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The concentrations of solutions of TNP-ATP were determined in Tris-HCl or Tris acetate buffer at pH 8 using ε408 nm = 2.64 × 104m−1 cm−1 (23Hiratsuka T. Uchida K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 320: 635-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). [γ-32P]ATP at a specific activity of 1–10 Ci/mmol was purchased from NEN Life Science Products or synthesized from [32Pi] and ATP according to the exchange method of Glynn and Chappell (25Glynn I.M. Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1964; 90: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1258) Google Scholar) as modified by Grubmeyer and Penefsky (24Grubmeyer C. Penefsky H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 3718-3727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Poly(C) was from Miles Laboratories; poly(U) was from Boehringer Mannheim, ICN, or Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; and poly(A) was from Boehringer Mannheim. Each was dissolved in water to 2 or 10 mg/ml. [18O]H2O from Isotech, Inc., was 98.5 atom %. D2O was from Aldrich. TAGME buffer is 40 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.3, at room temperature (21–24 °C), 150 mm potassium glutamate, 1 mm magnesium acetate, 0.1 mm EDTA. V max, K m, ATP binding, and isotope partitioning measurements were carried out as in Stitt (15Stitt B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11130-11137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) except that for most experiments the buffer was 40 mm Tris acetate and 150 mm potassium glutamate rather than 40 mm Tris-HCl and 50 mm KCl, and many experiments were conducted at room temperature to facilitate comparison with rapid mix results; exceptions are noted. To separate free from bound ATP in binding experiments, a Microcon-10 ultrafiltration apparatus was used (Amicon). In control samples from which Rho was omitted, 3–5% of the adenine nucleotide bound to the apparatus; all measurements of bound and free nucleotide were corrected for this adventitious binding. For V maxmeasurements at room temperature, assays in general were carried out in 100 μl volumes that were 0.5–1 mm in adenine nucleoside triphosphate and contained 1–2 μg/ml poly(C), and the amount of Pi product was determined following an acid quench and charcoal absorption of adenine nucleotides from the entire reaction volume, as described below. To measure rates for the slowest reactions, 200–300-μl mixtures were prepared and multiple 10–20-μl samples removed for Pi determinations at various times; rates were obtained from linear portions of plots of nucleotide hydrolyzedversus time. Experiments with ATPγS were conducted with 5-fold more Rho than usual (2.5 rather than 0.5 μg/ml in the assay) and for 40 min (rather than the standard 20 min at room temperature); assays involving poly(U) and ATP used 10-fold higher than normal concentrations of both Rho and poly(U) and were for 40 min; for TNP-ATP with poly(U) and ATP with poly(A), final concentrations of 1.33 mg/ml Rho and 300 μg/ml polynucleotide were used, with multiple Pi determinations between 0 and 30 min after addition of Rho; and for poly(A) with TNP-ATP, 1.33 mg/ml enzyme and 1.5 mg/ml polynucleotide were used, with samples taken at hourly intervals to 6 h. In all cases, similar reaction mixtures lacking either enzyme or RNA served as controls. The rate of ATP hydrolysis by Rho in the absence of RNA was measured using Rho at 1.76 μg/ml in TAGME buffer with 200 μm[γ-32P]ATP at 20,000 cpm/nmol. At t = 0 and at 30–60-min intervals to t = 2 h, the amount of 32Pi was determined in 50-μl samples following charcoal absorption of adenine nucleotides (described below). To assay for a burst of ATP hydrolysis in the absence of RNA, 90-μl mixtures were prepared, each containing 10 μm[γ-32P]ATP at 660,000 cpm/nmol (with 3.3% background32Pi radioactivity) or 0.5 mm[γ-32P]TNP-ATP at 1500 cpm/nmol (0.5% background Pi counts). The final component added to control tubes was 10 μl of buffer; to other tubes, 133 μg of Rho (468 pmol hexamer) was added in a volume of 10 μl. 250 μl of 5% w/v trichloroacetic acid quench was mixed with the contents of each tube 2–3 s after the addition of the final component, followed by 150 μl of acid-washed charcoal (80 mg/ml in water). For ATP, a second sample was quenched 60 s after addition of the final component. After pelleting the charcoal with bound adenine nucleotides by centrifugation in a microcentrifuge at 12,000 × g for 2 min, 200 μl of the supernatant was removed and the amount of32Pi determined by liquid scintillation. These experiments were carried out using an Update Instruments model 1010 with a grid-type mixer of 1.6-μl volume. Experiments were at room temperature (21–23 °C) or at 4 °C and were conducted in TAGME buffer. Two experimental designs were used. In the first, Rho + [γ-32P]ATP were present in one syringe, and RNA in the second; alternatively, Rho alone was in one syringe, with RNA + radiolabeled nucleoside triphosphate in the second. In the first experimental design, the results were corrected for the slow Rho-catalyzed hydrolysis of [γ-32P]ATP in the absence of RNA, which was significant at the high concentration of Rho employed. The second experimental configuration gave similar results but did not involve such a correction and was preferentially used. In general, approximately 100 μl of mixed, aged reactants (50 μl from each syringe) were ejected from the aging hose into 400 μl of 5% w/v trichloroacetic acid quench. 50 μl of the quenched mix was taken to determine total radioactivity and thus the volume that was actually quenched. 350 μl of the quenched mix was assayed for [32Pi] (or, in the case of ATPγS, [35S] thiophosphate) following charcoal absorption of adenine nucleotides as described above. The concentrations of reactants in the mixer in most experiments were as follows: Rho, 0.88 mg/ml (10 μm active sites); [γ-32P]ATP or its analogs, 0.1 mm (the equivalent of 30 ATP molecules per Rho hexamer); RNA, 0.2 mg/ml (600 μm bases; thus two 100-base lengths of RNA per hexamer). These values were chosen so that the ATP concentration was sufficiently high that its on-rate (estimated fromk cat /K m)was not limiting, and the enzyme concentration was such that turnover of a single ATP per hexamer would produce product 32Pisignificantly above the background level of32Pi in the nucleoside triphosphate substrates. In one experiment with TNP-ATP and poly(C), tripling the nucleoside triphosphate concentration while doubling those of enzyme and RNA produced similar results. Aging times (the times elapsed between mixing and quenching) ranged from 2.7 ms to 1–2 s for ATP with poly(C), TNP-ATP with poly(C), and in low ATP with chase experiments, and 2.7 ms to 60 s for ATPγS with poly(C), ATP with poly(U), TNP-ATP with poly(U), and at low ATP levels. These experiments, using 0.35 μm Rho hexamer and 0.17–6.0 μm[γ-32P]ATP at 511 cpm/pmol, were carried out as in Stitt (15Stitt B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11130-11137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that in most cases TAGME buffer was used, and a 50-μl sample was injected into 150 μl of chase solution, followed by 50 μl of 50% w/v trichloroacetic acid as quenching agent. ATP hydrolysis was monitored as above by measuring the production of [32Pi] from [γ-32P]ATP following charcoal precipitation of adenine nucleotides. The same binding mixture was used for both binding and isotope partitioning measurements. In experiments with [γ-32P]TNP-ATP, the ligand was 0.19–5.9 μm at 1075 cpm/pmol. 0.5-ml reactions were prepared in a final concentration of 80% [18O]H2O in TAGME buffer; several different protocols were used as follows. 1) For V maxconditions, the reaction contained 1 μg of Rho, 0.4 μg of poly(C), and was 2 mm in ATP, 3 mm in magnesium acetate. This reaction was quenched after 30 min at 37 °C, when about 60% of the ATP had been hydrolyzed, by addition of EDTA to 10 mm. As a control, an identical mixture lacking Rho was also prepared. 2) A reaction at a low ATP concentration of 5 μm was prepared similarly to the V max reaction, with the addition of an ATP-regenerating system consisting of phosphoenolpyruvate at 1 mm plus 5 μg of pyruvate kinase. This reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 3 h prior to addition of a similar EDTA quench. 3) To detect net reversal of ATP hydrolysis, a mixture similar to the first was prepared, with ATP replaced by 2 mm ADP plus 2 mm Pi. This mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 5.5 h prior to addition of the EDTA quench. Following quenching, each reaction mixture was filtered through an Amicon Microcon 10 ultrafiltration apparatus and was stored at −20 °C until analysis. At this time the samples were thawed, supplemented with D2O to 10% v/v, and analyzed by one-dimensional 31P NMR with proton decoupling using a Brüker DRX300 spectrometer operating at 121.5 MHz. The E. coli Rho protein used in an earlier determination of the kinetic mechanism (15Stitt B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11130-11137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is now known to carry the mutation E155K (22Nehrke K.W. Seifried S.E. Platt T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 6107Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 26Platt T. Richardson J.P. McKnight S.L. Yamamoto K.R. Transcriptional Regulation. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 365-388Google Scholar); this mutation lies in a proposed hinge region of Rho between the RNA-binding amino terminus and the ATP-binding domain (27Opperman T. Richardson J.P. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 5033-5043Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Parameters important to the present work were therefore remeasured for the true wild type Rho (Rho+) that was used in these studies. (A more complete study of adenine nucleotide interactions with RhoE155K was published earlier (15Stitt B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11130-11137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).) Table I shows data obtained at 22 °C for the two types of Rho using poly(C) as the RNA cofactor; values fork cat , K m,K D, and n values for binding and isotope partitioning are unaffected by the mutation. Rho+ and RhoE155K also have similar K m values at 37 °C for ATP, 8–10 μm, and similar hexamer V maxvalues with poly(C). A notable feature of both types of Rho is the ∼10-fold tighter binding of ATP in chloride- versusglutamate-containing buffer. This difference is also seen in isotope partitioning experiments: in chloride-containing buffer all bound ATP molecules are hydrolyzed upon addition of RNA, but in glutamate-containing buffer only ∼70% of bound ATP molecules are hydrolyzed because of a faster off-rate. (The off-rates in Table II are calculated, minimum values; we note that to explain the isotope partitioning results,k off in glutamate buffer must be slightly faster than the calculated 6.6 s−1.)Table IProperties of Rho and RhoE155K at 22 °CEnzyme Rho+Enzyme RhoE155KTKMETAGMETKMETAGMEk cat10 s−110 s−110 s−110 s−1K m ATP7 μm3 μmk cat/K m1.4 × 106m−1 s−13.3 × 106m−1 s−1K DATP0.4 μm2 μm0.2 μm4 μmk off0.56 s−16.6 s−1ATP-bound/ hexamer3333IPP32–2.52.82.6Buffer TKME includes 50 mm KCl; buffer TAGME includes 150 mm potassium glutamate.

Nucleotides labeled in the γ-phosphoryl group were used, and their hydrolysis was quantitated by measurement of the amount of labeled phosphate product in quenched samples (see “Materials and Methods”). Number of times the experiment was performed. For both types of Rho, our experiments indicated 3 ATP molecules bound per hexamer (Fig. 1) and did not show a second class of binding sites with lower affinity for ATP (16Geiselmann J. von Hippel P.H. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 850-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). If data from ultrafiltration binding experiments were not corrected for ATP bound to the apparatus in the absence of Rho, then, as shown in theinset to Fig. 1, an additional class of ATP-binding sites appears to exist. These “sites” apparently represent adventitious binding of ATP to the apparatus, rather than a second class of sites on Rho. Earlier work demonstrated three adenine nucleotide-binding sites on Rho both in the absence and presence of RNA (15Stitt B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11130-11137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously (15Stitt B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11130-11137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the rate of ATP hydrolysis by RhoE155K at 37 °C in the absence of RNA was estimated to be no greater than 2 ATP molecules/hexamer/h. Additional measurements showed that the rate at 22 °C for Rho+ is linear, with values from 1.5 to 4.4 × 10−4 s−1 hexamer−1, 100,000-fold slower than the poly(C)-stimulated V max (data not shown). In addition, samples taken within 5 s after the addition of Rho to mixtures containing either [γ-32P]ATP or the ribose-modified ATP analog [γ-32P]TNP-ATP showed no burst of32Pi formation (see “Materials and Methods”). Thus ATP hydrolysis on the enzyme in the absence of RNA is slow, with no evidence for rapid on-enzyme hydrolysis of bound ATP molecules followed by slow product release. To gain further understanding of the molecular mechanism by which Rho uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis, we wanted to determine whether the ATP molecules bound in catalytic sites are hydrolyzed simultaneously or sequentially upon RNA binding. To address this question we performed rapid mix experiments employing chemical quench techniques (28Johnson K.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 38-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). In these experiments, components of a reaction are separately loaded into two syringes that are connected to a small grid-type mixing chamber with an outlet to an aging hose. A ram drives both syringe plungers simultaneously, forcing portions of the contents of the syringes through the 1.6-μl mixer and into the aging hose. After the mixed reactants have aged for a defined time, a volume of the reaction is quenched with acid and then assayed for product to determine the extent of the reaction. A notable feature of this technique is that it measures the sum of products that are enzyme-bound plus those that have been released into solution. When Rho was mixed with excess poly(C) and [γ-32P]ATP using this apparatus (see “Materials and Methods”), 1 mol of ATP per mol of Rho hexamer was hydrolyzed at the fastest quench time, 2.7 ms after mixing (Fig. 2; Table II). This burst was followed by steady-state hydrolysis atV max (which was measured using the same sample in separate experiments). Two independent preparations of Rho and several batches of [γ-32P]ATP gave similar results. Since Rho has three active sites per hexamer, a hydrolysis burst of one ATP per hexamer could result from irreversible hydrolysis of ATP at only one of the three sites. Alternatively, the burst could reflect the value of an on-enzyme equilibrium between substrates and products at each active site (prior to product release) whose final position is equivalent to 0.33 ATP hydrolyzed per site (28Johnson K.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 249: 38-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). The results of several experiments excluded this alternative explanation. Establishment of an equilibrium requires the reversible hydrolysis of ATP in the active site. Such an equilibrium is very unlikely given the reported absence of on-enzyme intermediate Pi/H2O oxygen exchange for RhoE155K (15Stitt B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11130-11137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, to test the wild type enzyme, the phosphate product from reactions in which Rho hydrolyzed [γ-16O3]ATP in 18O water was analyzed for 18O content by NMR. At least one solvent18O atom must be incorporated into product Piduring hydrolysis in [18O]H2O. On-enzyme reversibility of the chemistry would be indicated by the production of phosphate with more than one 18O atom. Fig. 3 shows the NMR spectrum of the phosphate product from a V max reaction; no phosphate molecules with more than one 18O atom were found (less than 5% excess incorporation would have been easily detected). The same result was found in an experiment carried out at 5 μm ATP in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system, indicating that no different behavior occurred under non-saturating substrate conditions. We further tested for reversibility of ATP hydrolysis by Rho by incubating the enzyme with RNA, ADP, and Pi in [18O]H2O-containing buffer for more than 5 h, followed by analysis of Pi for 18O content. In this experiment, no 18O-containing phosphate was found. We therefore conclude that ATP hydrolysis by Rho is irreversible. Our rapid mix results demonst"
https://openalex.org/W2145882414,"This study was performed to investigate a mechanism of angiotensin II (Ang II)-mediated activation of the fibronectin (FN) gene in rat vascular smooth muscle cells. Actinomycin D and CV11974 completely inhibited Ang II-mediated increase in FN mRNA levels. Inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC), protein-tyrosine kinase (PTK), phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C, Ras, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, p70 S6 kinase, and Ca2+/calmodulin kinase also decreased Ang II-induced activation of FN mRNA. In contrast, cycloheximide; PD123319; or inhibitors of Gi, protein kinase A, or mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase did not affect the induction. FN promoter contained a putative AP-1 binding site (rFN/AP-1; −463 to −437), and the results of a transient transfection and electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that Ang II enhanced rFN/AP-1 activity. CV11974 and inhibitors of PKC or PTK suppressed Ang II-mediated increases in rFN/AP-1 activity, although neither PD123319 nor a protein kinase A inhibitor affected the induction. Furthermore, mutation of rFN/AP-1 that disrupted nuclear binding suppressed Ang II-induced transcription in the native FN promoter (−1908 to +136) context. Thus, Ang II activates transcription of the FN gene through the Ang II type 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle cells, at least in part, via the activation of AP-1 by a signaling mechanism dependent on PKC and PTK. This study was performed to investigate a mechanism of angiotensin II (Ang II)-mediated activation of the fibronectin (FN) gene in rat vascular smooth muscle cells.

Thus, Ang II activates transcription of the FN gene through the Ang II type 1 receptor in vascular smooth muscle cells, at least in part, via the activation of AP-1 by a signaling mechanism dependent on PKC and PTK. fibronectin vascular smooth muscle cell angiotensin-converting enzyme angiotensin II angiotensin II type 1 angiotensin II type 2 phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C protein kinase C pertussis toxin chloramphenicol acetyltransferase rat fibronectin promoter AP-1 binding motif electrophoretic mobility shift assay protein-tyrosine kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase mitogen-activated protein p70 S6 kinase thymidine kinase kilobase pair renin-angiotensin system. Hemodynamic and endocrine factors are among the most important factors implicated in the physiology and pathophysiology of the vascular wall. Arterial hypertension evokes structural and functional changes of the vascular wall (1Folkow B. Physiol. Rev. 1982; 62: 347-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar, 2Mulvany M.J. Am. J. Med. 1993; 94: 20S-23SPubMed Google Scholar). Modifications of the extracellular matrix, including fibronectin (FN)1 and collagen, have been previously reported in vessel walls of hypertensive animals (3Takasaki I. Chobanian A.V. Sarzani R. Brecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21935-21939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Chobanian A.V. Hypertension. 1990; 15: 666-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 5Contard F.

Activation and qualitative changes in the extracellular matrix participate in vascular wall remodeling and in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Vascular remodeling in hypertension may be an adaptive response to increased transmural pressure (6Glagov S. Zarins C. Giddens D.P. Ku D.N. Arch. Pathol. Lab. Med. 1988; 112: 1018-1031PubMed Google Scholar, 7Chobanian A.V. Am. J. Cardiol. 1992; 69: 3E-7EAbstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 8Dzau, V. J., and Gibbons, G. H. (1993) J. Cardiovasc. Pharmacol. 21, Suppl. 1, 1–5Google Scholar, 9Glagov S. Circulation. 1994; 89: 2888-2891Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Mechanical stress seems to play a direct role in vascular remodeling, since mechanical stretch is able to increase protein synthesis by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) (10Grande J.P. Glagov S. Bates S.R. Horwitz A.L. Arteriosclerosis. 1989; 9: 446-452Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, neuronal and humoral factors may be critical in hypertension-induced remodeling of vascular wall. Especially, several in vivo studies have reported that hypertension activates the vascular renin-angiotensin system (RAS) including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) (11Shiota N. Miyazaki M. Okunishi H. Hypertension. 1992; 20: 168-174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and infusion of pressor and subpressor doses of angiotensin II (Ang II) increases aortic FN mRNA in both hypertensive and normotensive animals (12Himeno H. Crawford D.C. Hosoi M. Chovanian A.V. Brecher P. Hypertension. 1994; 23: 823-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,13Kim S. Ohta K. Hamaguchi A. Omura T. Tominaga K. Yukimura T. Miura K. Tanaka M. Iwao H. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 113: 662-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Ang II evokes diverse physiological response including arterial vasoconstriction to elevate blood pressure in vivo (14Tamura K. Umemura S. Fukamizu A. Ishii M. Murakami K. Hypertens. Res. 1995; 18: 7-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and increases production of collagen with a growth-promoting effect on VSMCs in vitro (15Kato H. Suzuki H. Tajima S. Ogata Y. Tominaga T. Sato A. Saruta T. J. Hypertens. 1991; 9: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). Pharmacological evidence has defined at least two subtypes of Ang II receptors, Ang II type 1 (AT1) receptor and Ang II type 2 (AT2) receptor. Previous results of molecular cloning have revealed that both receptor subtypes belong to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors with seven transmembrane helices (16Murphy T.J. Alexander R.W. Griendling K.K. Runge M.S. Bernstein K.E. Nature. 1991; 351: 233-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar, 17Sasaki K. Yamano Y. Bardham S. Iwai N. Murray J.J. Hasegawa M. Matsuda Y.

Chem. 1993; 268: 24543-24546Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). According to the recent results of in vitro studies, Ang II initially activates a phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) via its binding to AT1 receptor on the surface of VSMCs, leading to the generation of inositol triphosphate and diacylglycerol (20Griendling K.K. Rittenhouse S.E. Brock T.A. Ekstein L.S. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Alexsander R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5901-5906Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which are involved in intracellular Ca2+ mobilization (21Berridge M.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 59-193Crossref Scopus (2454) Google Scholar) and protein kinase C (PKC) activation (22Nishizuka Y. Nature. 1988; 351: 662-665Google Scholar), respectively. In VSMCs, Ang II also induces a rapid increase in expression of the growth-associated nuclear proto-oncogenes and stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple substrates (23Naftilan A.J. Pratt R.E. Dzau V.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 24Berk B.C. Corson M.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 607-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). These findings, taken together with relatively abundant expression of AT1 receptor in vascular wall and VSMCs, indicate that Ang II plays an important role in vascular remodeling via an AT1 receptor pathway. Thus, investigation of the mechanism of Ang II-induced regulation of extracellular matrix and tissue RAS in VSMCs is essential in elucidating the mechanism of vascular remodeling and the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In the present study, we examined the effects of Ang II on gene expression of extracellular matrix components (FN and collagen) and RAS components (angiotensinogen, ACE, and AT1 receptor) in VSMCs. We obtained evidence for induction of expression of FN and collagen but not angiotensinogen, ACE, or AT1 receptor. Furthermore, interactions of several signal transduction pathways were involved in Ang II-induced expression of FN in VSMCs, and a specific promoter region, the AP-1 element, of the FN gene might play an important role in the Ang II-mediated increase in FN mRNA. RPMI 1640 medium, fetal calf serum, penicillin, and streptomycin were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Ang II, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, A23187, 8-bromo-cAMP, HA-1004, H-7, genistein, pertussis toxin (PTX), manumycin, rapamycin, actinomycin D, and cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma. Calphostin C, herbimycin A, H-89, U-73122, PD98059, BAPTA-AM, and calmidazolium chloride, were obtained from Calbiochem. Wortmannin was purchased from Bio-Mol. AT1 receptor-specific antagonist CV11974 and AT2 receptor-specific antagonist PD123329 were supplied from Takeda Chemical and Perk Davis, respectively. VSMCs were aseptically isolated from thoracic aortic explants of 5-week-old Sprague-Dawley rats. Cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and equilibrated with 95% air, 5% CO2. Subconfluent cells were passaged by trypsinization in 0.05% trypsin in PBS and reseeded in RPMI 1640 medium plus 10% fetal calf serum. VSMCs were identified by their typical hill and valley morphology in culture and their characteristic immunocytochemical staining for α-smooth muscle actin (monoclonal anti-smooth muscle α-actin antibody, Sigma). Subcultured VSMCs from passages 3–19 were used in the experiments. For the experiments, cells at approximately 80% confluence in dishes were made quiescent by incubation with serum-free RPMI 1640 medium for 24 h, unless otherwise stated. Northern blot analysis was performed essentially as described previously (25Tamura K. Tanimoto K. Ishii M. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15024-15032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Total cellular RNA was isolated from VSMCs, using the single-step method by acid guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol chloroform extraction (26Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63187) Google Scholar). Twenty micrograms of each total RNA sample were denatured with 1 mglyoxal and 50% dimethyl sulfoxide, electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose gel, and transferred to GeneScreen Plus (Nylon) membrane (DuPont). Filters were prehybridized for 1 h at 65 °C in a solution consisting of 1% SDS, 1 m NaCl, and 10% dextran sulfate. Hybridization proceeded for 24 h at 65 °C in the same solution containing 200 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA and 3 × 105 cpm/ml of the 32P-labeled probes. Filters were washed twice with 2× SSC (1× SSC: 0.15 m NaCl, 0.015m sodium citrate) for 5 min at room temperature, twice with 2× SSC and 1% SDS for 30 min at 60 °C, and twice with 0.1× SSC for 30 min at room temperature. Dried filters were exposed to x-ray film or to the imaging plate of FUJIX BIO-Imaging Analyzer BAS2000 (Fuji Photo Film). Rat FN cDNA probes kindly provided by Dr. Hynes were utilized for Northern blot analysis. One probe, which encodes the 10th and 11th type I repeat (a 0.51-kbHindIII/NheI fragment) shared by all isoforms of FN, was used to detect total FN mRNA (27Schwarzbauer J.E. Tamkun J.W. Lemischka I.R. Hynes R.O. Cell. 1983; 35: 421-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar). Other rat FN cDNA probes for EIIIA (a 0.55-kb PvuII/NheI fragment), EIIIB (a 0.59-kb PvuII/NheI fragment), and V region (a 0.60-kb PvuII/NheI fragment) were used to detect only FN mRNA with EIIIA, EIIIB, and V domain, respectively (28Odermatt E.

Rat α1 chain of type I collagen cDNA (a 1.3-kbPstI/BamHI fragment) was supplied by Dr. Rowe (29Genovese C. Rowe D. Kream B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6210-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Rat angiotensinogen cDNA probe (a 1.1-kbAccI/AccI fragment) was generously provided by Drs. Ohkubo and Nakanishi (30Ohkubo H. Kageyama R. Ujihara M. Hirose T. Inayama S. Nakanishi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 2196-2200Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). ACE (a 2.3-kbEcoRI/BglII fragment) cDNA was provided by Dr. Corvol (31Soubrier F. Alhenc-Gelas F. Hubert C. Allegrini J. John M. Tregear G. Corvol P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Michot B. Bachellerie J.-P. FEBS Lett. 1984; 167: 263-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). pUCSV3CAT contains the coding sequence for CAT with SV40 enhancer/promoter sequence and polyadenylation signal fused in the 5′-end of the CAT coding sequence (34Fukamizu A. Tanimoto K. Uehara S. Seo M.S. Handa S. Sagara M. Takahashi S. Imai T. Murakami K. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1991; 50: 659-663PubMed Google Scholar). pUCSV0CAT has a SV40 polyadenylation signal 5′ to the CAT coding gene and efficiently terminates the read-through transcription arising from prokaryotic sequences in the constructs (34Fukamizu A. Tanimoto K. Uehara S. Seo M.S. Handa S. Sagara M. Takahashi S. Imai T. Murakami K. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1991; 50: 659-663PubMed Google Scholar). pUCSV3CAT was used as a positive control, and pUCSV0CAT was used as a background reference. Construction of TK-CAT, containing the herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase promoter upstream of the CAT coding gene, was described previously (35Tanimoto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 409-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Double-stranded oligonucleotides of the rat FN promoter region carrying a consensus sequence of AP-1 binding site (rat FN promoter AP-1 binding sequences, rFN/AP-1) was linked upstream to TK-CAT in 5′ to 3′ orientation to construct rFN/AP-1/TK-CAT. The sequences of oligonucleotides were 5′-TTCTCAGAGGTGACGCAATGTTCTCAA-3′ (rFN/AP-1, positions −463 to −437 of the rat fibronectin promoter; the AP-1 binding motif is underlined). Plasmid rFN-CAT was constructed by inserting a 2044-bpPstI/PstI rat FN promoter fragment (−1908 to +136 relative to the major transcription start site) excised from pF1900CAT (36Nakajima T. Nakamura T. Tsunoda S. Nakada S. Oda K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2837-2846Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into the BglII/HindIII sites upstream of the CAT coding sequences of pUCSV0CAT (34Fukamizu A. Tanimoto K. Uehara S. Seo M.S. Handa S. Sagara M. Takahashi S. Imai T. Murakami K. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1991; 50: 659-663PubMed Google Scholar). rFN-CAT was used as a template to construct mutations in the rFN/AP-1 element (rFN/m[AP-1] element) by oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis (37Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2102) Google Scholar). Sequences of the oligonucleotides used to create the rFN/m[AP-1] element were 5′-TTCTCAGAGGTacgtCAATGTTCTCAA-3′. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on a Milligen/Bioresearch Cyclone™ Plus oligonucleotide synthesizer and purified on OPC columns (Applied Biosystems) as described by the manufacturer. Once the mutations were obtained and confirmed by sequencing, the altered 2044-bp (−1908 to +136) fragment was subcloned into theBglII/HindIII sites of pUCSV0CAT (rFN/m[AP-1]-CAT). The FN promoter-CAT chimeric construct (3 μg) and a β-galactosidase expression plasmid pCH110 (1 μg), which is used to normalize transfection efficiency, were transiently cotransfected into VSMCs as described previously (38Tamura K. Umemura S. Ishii M. Tanimoto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1370-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 39Tamura K. Umemura S. Nyui N. Yamaguchi S. Ishigami T. Hibi K. Yabana M. Kihara M. Fukamizu A. Murakami K. Ishii M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Media were replaced with fresh serum-free media 12 h after the transfection, and cells were incubated for 24 h. VSMCs were then pretreated with Ang II receptor antagonists or signaling inhibitors for 30 min, followed by treatment with Ang II (10−7m) for 18 h. Aliquots of cell extracts containing equal amounts of total protein (80μg) were used for CAT assay. CAT assay was performed as described previously (38Tamura K. Umemura S. Ishii M. Tanimoto K. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 93: 1370-1379Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 39Tamura K. Umemura S. Nyui N. Yamaguchi S. Ishigami T. Hibi K. Yabana M. Kihara M. Fukamizu A. Murakami K. Ishii M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), and results were normalized on the basis of protein concentration or β-galactosidase activity to correct for differences in transfection efficiency. The conversion ratios of [14C]chloramphenicol were measured with an image analysis system (BAS2000). All experiments were performed four times for each construct. VSMCs were pretreated with Ang II receptor antagonists or signaling inhibitors for 30 min, followed by treatment with Ang II (10−7m) for 18 h. Nuclear extracts from VSMCs were prepared using a modification of the protocol of Dignam et al. (40Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9160) Google Scholar, 41Swick A.G. Blake M.C. Kahn J.W. Azizkhan J.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 9291-9304Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The final protein concentration was 5–7 mg/ml. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was performed essentially as described previously (25Tamura K. Tanimoto K. Ishii M. Murakami K. Fukamizu A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15024-15032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Tamura K. Umemura S. Nyui N. Yamaguchi S. Ishigami T. Hibi K. Yabana M. Kihara M. Fukamizu A. Murakami K. Ishii M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16845-16851Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Briefly, double-stranded rFN/AP-1 sequences were phosphorylated at both ends using T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. Nuclear extracts were preincubated for 15 min on ice in a 20-μl reaction mixture containing 12 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mmKCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 12% glycerol, and 500 ng of double-stranded poly(dI-dC) in the presence or absence of a 50- or 100-fold excess of a specific double-stranded competitor DNA. 0.1–0.5 ng (approximately 15,000 cpm) of a radiolabeled DNA probe were added, and the incubation continued for 30 min at room temperature. The incubation mixture was loaded on a 5% polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE and electrophoresed at 140 V for 3 h followed by autoradiography. Oligonucleotides containing the consensus binding sequences for AP-1 (CTAGTGATGAGTCAGCCGGATC) and AP-2 (GATCGAACTGACCGCCCGCGGCCCGT) were obtained from Stratagene (GELSHIFT™ kit) and used for an electrophoretic competition assay. To examine whether Ang II was a major activator of FN production in VSMCs, we first assessed effects of serum and several vasoactive substances including Ang II on FN gene expression by Northern blot analysis. After VSMCs were made quiescent by incubation with serum-free medium for 24 h, VSMCs were incubated with the indicated medium for 36 h. As shown in Fig. 1, a low level of FN mRNA could be detected in untreated control VSMCs. The mRNA level was markedly increased after exposure of the cells to FBS (10%), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (10−9m), or Ang II (10−7m), whereas treatment with A23187 (10−5m) or 8-bromo-cAMP (10−4m) did not affect the FN mRNA levels. Then we examined the concentration dependence of Ang II-induced expression of FN mRNA in VSMCs. As shown in Fig. 2, the activation of FN mRNA expression was dependent on the concentration of Ang II; increased expression was initially detectable at 10−11m, half-maximal at approximately 5 × 10−10m, and maximal at 10−7 to 10−6m.Figure 2Concentration-dependent effect of Ang II on expression of FN mRNA in cultured rat VSMCs. VSMCs were stimulated with Ang II at the indicated concentrations for 36 h and FN mRNA/18 S ribosomal RNA (18S) levels were estimated. A, representative Northern blots of FN mRNA and 18 S ribosomal RNA from VSMCs (total RNA, 20 μg) treated with Ang II. Total RNAs from the rat liver (20 μg) and lung (20 μg) were also electrophoresed. Northern blot hybridization was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” B, relative FN mRNA levels. The levels of mRNA expression were measured as described in the legend of Fig. 1. Bars represent means of four independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We next examined the time course of extracellular matrix and RAS components mRNA expression induced by Ang II (10−7m). Expression of FN mRNA started to increase 3 h after Ang II treatment and peaked at 36 h, and at 48 h FN mRNA was still elevated compared with control (Fig. 3). We also found an increase in the level of type I collagen mRNA as early as 1 h after treatment, with its peak at 24 h. In contrast, the ACE mRNA level did not show any significant change after exposure to Ang II, and mRNA expression of angiotensinogen and AT1 receptor was decreased after exposure to Ang II. These results indicate that Ang II treatment specifically increases extracellular matrix mRNA expression but not RAS components mRNA expression in VSMCs. Several studies using antagonists of Ang II receptor subtypes and angiotensinogen-deficient mice suggest that Ang II exerts various effects on the expression of major component genes of the RAS by positive or negative feedback mechanisms (42Kohara K.

Although we and others showed that angiotensinogen gene expression was up-regulated in response to Ang II in hepatocytes, cardiac myocytes, and renal fibroblasts (46Li J. Brasier A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 252-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 47Ruiz-Ortega M. Egido J.

Physiol. 1998; 275: R1-R9Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the present results indicate that Ang II decreases expression of angiotensinogen mRNA in VSMCs. In addition, previous studies showed that Ang II down-regulated the vascular smooth muscle AT1 receptor by transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms (49Lassegue B. Alexander R.W. Nickenig G. Clark M. Murphy T.J. Griendling K.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 601-609PubMed Google Scholar, 50Wang D.H. Du Y. J. Hypertens. 1998; 16: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and the results in this study were consistent with these results. FN exists in several forms as a result of the alternative splicing of a single gene. The different isoforms are distinguished by the presence or absence of exon products and are designated in the rat as FN-EIIIA, FN-EIIIB, and FN-V (29Genovese C. Rowe D. Kream B. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6210-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). Changes in FN biosynthesis by VSMCs may have a causative role in hypertension and atherosclerosis (51Takasaki I. Chobanian A.V. Brecher P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 17686-17694Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a selective induction of the isoform containing the EIIIA insert, which is a fetal gene transcript, has been shown to occur during the development of vascular hypertrophy in response to hypertension (52Mamuya W. Chobanian A. Brecher P. Circ. Res. 1992; 71: 1341-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 53Takasaki I. Chobanian A.V. Sarzani R. Brecher P. Hypertension. 1992; 20: 20-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In the present study, Ang II appeared to increase the FN-EIIIA mRNA to a greater extent than the other isoforms (Fig. 4), thereby indicating that Ang II actually changed the phenotype of VSMCs.Figure 4Effect of Ang II on expression of alternative spliced forms of FN mRNA in VSMCs. VSMCs were stimulated with Ang II (10−7m) for the indicated durations, and FN mRNA/18 S ribosomal RNA (18S) levels were estimated. Representative Northern blots are shown of FN, FN-EIIIA, FN-EIIIB, and FN-V mRNAs and 18 S ribosomal RNA from VSMCs (total RNA, 20 μg) treated with Ang II. Northern blot hybridization was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the type of Ang II receptor(s) involved in mediating the enhanced expression of FN mRNA in response to Ang II, the effects of Ang II receptor antagonists were investigated. VSMCs were incubated for 30 min with CV11974 (10−6 and 10−5m), followed by treatment with Ang II (10−7m) for 24 h. Treatment of VSMCs with CV11974 abolished the stimulatory effect of Ang II (Fig. 5, lanes 3and 4). In contrast, incubation of cells with PD123319 (10−6 and 10−5m) did not affect the response to Ang II at all (Fig. 5, lanes 14 and 15). None of these Ang II receptor antagonists alone increased the expression of FN mRNA (Fig. 5,lanes 5 and 16). These results indicate that Ang II activates FN mRNA expression through an AT1 receptor pathway in VSMCs. Next, to determine whether de novo RNA or protein synthesis was required for Ang II-induced increase in FN mRNA, VSMCs were pretreated with actinomycin D or cycloheximide for 30 min and incubated for 24 h in the presence or absence of Ang II (10−7m) (Fig. 5). The RNA synthesis inhibitor actinomycin D not only abolished Ang II-mediated increase in FN mRNA but also lowered the basal FN mRNA level (Fig. 5, lanes 6–8), whereas the induction of FN mRNA by Ang II and the basal FN mRNA expression were not significantly altered by cycloheximide in VSMCs (Fig. 5, lanes 9–11). These results indicate that de novo mRNA transcription is required for the induction of FN mRNA expression by Ang II but that the effects of Ang II do not require de novo protein synthesis to stimulate the expression of FN mRNA. FN mRNA turnover was examined by inhibiting new mRNA transcription with actinomycin D (5 μg/ml; Fig. 6). Half-lives for FN mRNA in control VSMCs were ∼6.9 h. Treatment of VSMCs with Ang II for 12 h caused a slight increase (1.1-fold) in the half-life of FN mRNA (∼7.3 h). Taken together, these results suggest that up-regulation of FN mRNA is mainly induced by enhancement of gene transcription. The interaction of Ang II with Ang II receptors on VSMCs activates several intracellular signal transduction pathways, which results in increase in [Ca2+]iand activation of PKC and protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) (20Griendling K.K.

Organisms are always exposed to attacks of active oxygen species that are generated not only by exogenous environmental factors such as ionizing radiation and redox-cycling chemicals but also through endogenous oxygen metabolism (1Farr S.B. Kogoma T. Microbiol. Rev. 1991; 55: 561-585Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Halliwell B. Aruoma O.I. FEBS Lett. 1991; 281: 9-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (1465) Google Scholar). Active oxygen species are able to produce modifications in proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleotides (3Slater T.F. Biochem. J. 1984; 222: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar). Among the various types of DNA damage caused by active oxygen species, 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxo-G)1 may be responsible for a significant portion of spontaneous mutations, which would lead to induction of cancer as well as other age-related disorders (4Ames B.N. Science. 1983; 221: 1256-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (2746) Google Scholar). The 8-oxo-G residue present in DNA efficiently induces G:C → T:A transversion both in vitroand in vivo (5Shibutani S.

Res. 1991; 254: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar), and two genes of Escherichia coli, mutM and mutY, are involved in the repair process of this lesion (7Michaels M.L. Cruz C.

Yonei S. Yukawa O. J. Radiat. Res. 1997; 38: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The protein encoded by themutM gene (MutM or Fpg protein) possesses a DNA glycosylase activity that specifically removes 8-oxo-G from DNA, whereas the MutY protein has an enzymatic activity that removes an adenine base from an A:8-oxo-G pair as efficiently as from an A:G pair in DNA. Oxidation of guanine also proceeds in the form of free nucleotides, and an oxidized form of dGTP, 8-oxo-dGTP, is a potent mutagenic substrate for DNA synthesis (11Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). In contrast to the consequence of 8-oxo-G arising in DNA, 8-oxo-dGTP can induce A:T → C:G as well as G:C → T:A transversion (9Tajiri T. Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Mutat. Res. 1995; 336: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In E. coli, 8-oxo-dGTP can be eliminated from the nucleotide pool by MutT protein, the product of themutT gene, which hydrolyzes the mutagenic nucleotide to 8-oxo-dGMP (11Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). 8-Oxo-dGMP is further hydrolyzed by other enzymes and finally eliminated from the cellular nucleotide pools (12Hayakawa H. Taketomi A. Sakumi K. Kuwano M. Sekiguchi M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Lack of themutT gene increases the occurrence of A:T → C:G transversion but not G:C → T:A (13Yanofsky C. Cox E.C. Horn V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1966; 55: 274-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In the mutT mutant, 8-oxo-G misincorporated opposite the C residue of the template may be removed by the MutM protein before the next round of DNA replication.mutT homologues have been found in human, mouse, and rat (14Sakumi K.

Thus, 8-oxo-dGTP hydrolysis by MutT and related proteins may play a crucial role in reducing spontaneous mutation frequency in a wide range of organisms. In view of the importance of preserving genetic material, it is not surprising that organisms possess multiple pathways for removing oxygen-induced lesions. For example, oxidative pyrimidine residues, such as thymine glycol, in DNA can be removed by both endonuclease III and endonuclease VIII glycosylases in E. coli (17Melamede R.J. Hatahet Z. Kow Y.W. Ide H. Wallace S.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1255-1264Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar, 18Saito Y. Uraki F. Nakajima S. Asaeda A. Ono K. Kubo K. Yamamoto K. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 3783-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, N-methylpurine-DNA glycosylase functions to repair 8-oxo-G in DNA, in addition to 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase, a mammalian MutM homologue glycosylase (19Bessho T. Roy R.

Then, we have pursued a possibility that E. coli may possess a backup system for MutT, which plays a crucial role in high fidelity of DNA replication. By phenotypic rescue, we were able to clone a second E. coligene that suppresses increased mutation frequency of mutTmutants. The gene was subsequently shown to be the ribA, which encodes GTP cyclohydrolase II (GCHII) that catalyzes the first step of riboflavin biosynthesis (21Foor F. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3545-3551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Foor F. Brown G.M. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 66: 303-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 23Richter G. Ritz H. Katzenmeier G. Volk R. Kohnle A. Lottspeich F. Allendorf D. Bacher A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4045-4051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that GCHII can indeed hydrolyze 8-oxo-dGTP and its ribonucleotide counterpart, at a rate higher than that for GTP, the substrate for riboflavin biosynthesis. The bacterial strains used in this study were all derivatives of E. coli K12. Strain SY11 is a mutT::Cm derivative of SY5, which is an F factor-negative derivative of JM107 (24Yanisch-Perron C. Vieira J. Messing J. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 33: 103-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (11472) Google Scholar). Strain T-198 has themutT1 allele (25Cox E.C. Yanofsky C. J. Bacteriol. 1969; 100: 390-397Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). T-198R is a ribA::Km derivative of T-198. The mutT::Cm and ribA::Km alleles were made by the gene replacement method using the JC7623 (recBC sbcB) strain (26Winans S.C. Elledge S.J. Krueger J.H. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 1219-1221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Akasaka S. Yamamoto K. Mutat. Res. 1991; 254: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). An F episome from strain CC101, derived from P90C (28Cupples C.G. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), was transferred to SY11, yielding strain SY11F. The lacZ gene of the episome carries G:C → T:A transversion mutation at position 461 of the gene, and thus, only A:T to C:G transversion would revert the strain to the wild-type phenotype (28Cupples C.G. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5345-5349Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). XL1-Blue MRF′ (Stratagene) was used as the host of the M13 phage. Plasmid pMT11, carrying amutT::Cm allele, is a derivative of pSK6 (29Bhatnagar S.K. Bessman M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 8953-8957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid pBST was constructed by transferring a DNA fragment carrying the mutT gene from pSK6 into pBluescript II. Plasmid pGRA, carrying the E. coli ribA gene, is a derivative of pBluescript II. Plasmid pBS29 possesses theBglI-EcoRI fragment carrying the ribAgene. A His-tag fusion vector, pQE9, was purchased from Qiagen. The 0.9-kbp DNA fragment encoding the full-length GCHII was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using pBS29 as a template, using primers A (5′-CATGCAGCTTAAACGTGTGGCA-3′, corresponding to sequence −1 to +21 of the ribA gene) and B (5′-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′, which is an M13 universal primer). The PCR fragment was treated with Klenow polymerase, then SalI, and ligated to the Klenow polymerase-treated BamHI site and SalI site of vector pQE9, yielding pHT29. Vector plasmids, pJKKmf(−), pTZ18R, pTZ19R, and pBluescript II, were from our laboratory stocks. The Luria-Bertani (LB) broth, LB plates, M9 medium, and phosphate buffer used were described (30Akasaka S. Takimoto K. Yamamoto K. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 235: 173-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The minimal glucose (or lactose) agar medium is composed of M56 salt plus 0.35% glucose (or lactose), 1.5% agar and supplemented with 1 μg of thiamine per ml (27Akasaka S. Yamamoto K. Mutat. Res. 1991; 254: 27-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Ampicillin (Ap), chloramphenicol (Cm) and kanamycin (Km) were included, if necessary, in the medium at concentrations of 50, 30, and 50 μg/ml, respectively. Riboflavin, purchased from Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd. (Osaka, Japan), was included in the medium at a concentration of 50 μg/ml. Enzymes and reagents used for DNA manipulation and DNA sequencing were purchased from Takara Shuzo Co., Ltd. (Kyoto, Japan) and Applied Biosystems Inc. (Foster City, CA). DNA was isolated fromE. coli strain SY11 and digested with EcoRI. DNA fragments were inserted into the EcoRI site of plasmid pJKKmf(−), and the resulting recombinant DNA mixture was used to transform SY11F cells. The transformation mixture was plated on MacConkey agar containing 50 μg of Km per ml at a density of 200–500 colonies per plate. After incubation for 2 days at 37 °C, colonies with a few papillae were selected and individually grown overnight at 37 °C in LB broth containing Km. Plasmids were prepared from each of the cultures and examined for generation of LacZ+reversion. Restriction enzyme fragments were subcloned into pTZ18R, pTZ19R, and pBluescript II vectors, and their sequences were determined. Both strands were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method, using an ABI automated DNA sequencer model 373A. A homology search was achieved with the aid of the BLAST program. 2BLAST program available on-line athttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/index.html. LB broth (2 liters) containing 50 μg of Ap per ml was inoculated with 50 ml of an overnight culture of E. coli SY11 (mutT::Cm) carrying plasmid pBS29 with the ribA gene. The cells were grown at 37 °C for 16 h and harvested. The cells (7.5 g) were suspended in 20 ml of 200 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, supplemented with 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The suspension was sonicated and then centrifuged at 35,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatant was applied to a column (2.5 × 21 cm) of DEAE-Sephacel (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), equilibrated with buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm MgCl2) containing 150 mm of NaCl. After the column was washed with 400 ml of the same buffer, elution was performed with a linear gradient of 150–500 mmNaCl in buffer A. Fractions containing a significant amount of GCHII were pooled and concentrated by ultrafiltration with a YM10 membrane (Amicon). After dialysis, the sample was loaded onto an HPLC column of DEAE-5PW (Tosoh), and the column was extensively washed with buffer A containing 125 mm of NaCl. The column was developed with a linear gradient of 125–150 mm NaCl in buffer A at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min, and the enzyme was eluted at around 144 mm NaCl. The fractions with high levels of enzyme activity were pooled, dialyzed against buffer A, and stored at −20 °C. For the preparation of His-tag fusion GCHII, E. coliXL1-BlueMRF′ carrying pHT29 was grown at 37 °C for 16 h. The cells (5.5 g) were suspended in 15 ml of a buffer (50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl) and disrupted by sonication. The supernatant was loaded onto a Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) column. After the column was washed with a buffer (50 mmsodium phosphate, pH 6.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol), the protein was eluted with a gradient of 0 to 0.5 m imidazole in 150 ml of the buffer. Samples were used for analysis by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and for enzyme assay. To measure GTP cyclohydrolase II activity, the reaction was carried out with 5 mm GTP in a reaction mixture containing 200 mm Tris-phosphate, pH 8.7, 10 mm MgCl2, and 20 mmdithiothreitol. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, an equal volume of 11.4 mm diacetyl was added, and the mixture was heated at 95 °C for 30 min to convert 2,5-diamino-6-hydroxy-4-(5-phosphoribosylamino)-pyrimidine, the product of the enzyme reaction, to 6,7-dimethylpterin (23Richter G. Ritz H. Katzenmeier G. Volk R. Kohnle A. Lottspeich F. Allendorf D. Bacher A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4045-4051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After centrifugation, 15 μl of each sample was subjected to HPLC with an Oligo R3 (Perspective Biosystems) column equilibrated with 0.1m ammonium formate and 40% methanol, and the product was detected by fluorometric monitoring (excitation, 365 nm; emission, 435 nm). One unit of GCHII activity was defined as the amount of enzyme that produced 1 nmol of 2,5-diamino-6-hydroxy-4-(5-phosphoribosylamino)-pyrimidine/h at 37 °C. [α-32P]GTP and [α-32P]dGTP were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [α-32P]8-Oxo-GTP and [α-32P]8-oxo-dGTP were prepared as described previously (12Hayakawa H. Taketomi A. Sakumi K. Kuwano M. Sekiguchi M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out with an appropriate amount of purified GCHII or His-tag GCHII in 10 μl of a reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.8 μg of bovine serum albumin, 8 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 4% glycerol, and 20 μm either dGTP, GTP, 8-oxo-dGTP, or 8-oxo-GTP, each labeled at the α-32P position (20,000 cpm), as reported previously (31Yakushiji H. Maraboeuf F. Takahashi M. Deng Z.S. Kawabata S. Nakabeppu Y. Sekiguchi M. Mutat. Res. 1997; 384: 181-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was stopped by addition of an equal volume of 50 mm EDTA. A portion of the reaction mixture was spotted on a PEI-cellulose F thin layer chromatography plate (Merck) and developed with 1 m LiCl for 30 min. The product was quantitated by autoradiographic analysis with a molecular imager GS-250 (Bio-Rad). For product analysis, α-32P-labeled 8-oxo-dGTP or 8-oxo-GTP was incubated with GCHII at 30 °C for 30 min. A portion of the reaction mixture was applied to a Mono Q column and eluted with a linear gradient of 0.01 to 1 m triethylammonium hydrogen carbonate at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The radioactivity of the fractions was measured. Cells derived from an independent clone were inoculated into M9 medium containing, if necessary, 50 μg of riboflavin, 30 μg of Cm, 50 μg of Km, and/or 50 μg of Ap per ml, and the culture was incubated overnight with shaking at 37 °C. After the cells were washed by centrifugation, serial dilutions were made. Appropriate dilutions were plated on minimal lactose agar for a Lac+ reversion assay and minimal glucose agar for counting the number of viable cells. The viable cells were counted after 2 days of incubation at 37 °C, and Lac+ revertants were counted after 3 days. Aliquots of the appropriate dilutions were also plated on streptomycin (50 μg/ml)- or rifampicin (100 μg/ml)-containing LB plates, and numbers of resistant colonies were counted after overnight incubation at 37 °C. The mutator phenotype of strain SY11F, defective in themutT gene, is evident when colonies are produced on MacConkey agar. Numerous red papillae appeared, reflecting the frequent occurrence of A:T to C:G transversion in the lacZ gene, and this was the basis for screening of a second gene that suppresses themutT mutator. DNA prepared from SY11 cells was digested withEcoRI, and the resulting DNA fragments were inserted into a multi-copy plasmid vector, pJKKmf(−). The genomic library was introduced into SY11F cells, and bacterial colonies that exhibit a reduced number of papillae were isolated. Among several thousand transformants examined, one clone which showed distinctly lower mutation frequencies when measured with other characters was isolated. The plasmid carried a 4.5-kbp insert, and further analysis revealed that a 1.4-kbp BglI-EcoRI fragment possessed an ability to suppress the mutator phenotype. The DNA fragment was inserted into pBluescript II, yielding plasmid pBS29. To ascertain the extent of suppression of the mutator effect more precisely, mutation frequencies of three distinct characters were determined. As shown in Table I, the mutation frequencies of SY11F cells with pBS29 were considerably lower than those of SY11F cells with the vector alone. The extent of suppression achieved with pBS29 was, however, low compared with the effect of the authentic mutT + gene, located on pBST.Table ISuppression of mutT mutator phenotypePlasmidMutation frequenciesLac+/106 cellsSmr/108cellsRifr/108 cellspBluescript II49.2 ± 11.851.4 ± 21.019.8 ± 5.8pBS29 (ribA +)0.17 ± 0.152.9 ± 0.82.1 ± 1.6pBST (mutT +)0.00750.016 ± 0.0130.24 ± 0.18E. coli SY11F (mutT::Cm) cells carrying either one type of plasmid pBluescript II, pBS29, or pBST were examined for occurrence of mutations toward Lac+, streptomycin resistance (Smr), and rifampicin resistance (Rifr).

Mutation frequency was then calculated by assuming that all the Lac+ mutations occur randomly following Poisson distribution.

The nucleotide sequence of the 1.4-kbp insert of pBS29 was determined using the dideoxy method. The sequence contained a 588-bp open reading frame, which would code for a protein with 196 amino acid residues. Computer-aided analysis revealed that it is identical to the ribA gene, encoding GCHII of E. coli (23Richter G. Ritz H. Katzenmeier G. Volk R. Kohnle A. Lottspeich F. Allendorf D. Bacher A. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4045-4051Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To see whether the gene of pBS29 can complement the ribA-defective character, strain JC7623ribA was transformed with plasmid pBS29. The transformant was able to grow in a medium without riboflavin, indicating that the plasmid carries the ribA gene. GCHII is one of the enzymes involved in biosynthesis of riboflavin. It catalyzes conversion of GTP to 2,5-diamino-6-hydroxy-4-(5-phosphoribosylamino)-pyrimidine, releasing formate and pyrophosphate (21Foor F. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3545-3551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This GTP pyrophosphorolysis partly mimics the reaction catalyzed by MutT protein, although there is no ring opening in the latter reaction (see Fig. 4). We have then asked whether GCHII acts on oxidized forms of guanine nucleotide. GCHII protein was overproduced in SY11F cells carrying pBS29 and purified to apparent physical homogeneity. His-tag GCHII, which carries additional amino acids residues (MRGSH6GC) at the N-terminal, was also purified from an extract of XL1-Blue MRF′ cells harboring pHT29, by using a different purification procedure. On SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the 21.8-kDa GCHII protein moved slightly faster than did the 25.8-kDa His-tag GCHII protein (Fig. 1 A). As shown in Fig. 1 B, GTP cyclohydrolase activity was evidently present in the preparation of GCHII. A similar result was obtained with His-tag protein (data not shown). We examined abilities of purified preparations of GCHII and His-tag GCHII proteins to hydrolyze 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP. Fig. 2 shows that both preparations can hydrolyze 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP, yielding unique fast-moving products. The R F values of the fast-moving products coincided with those of 8-oxo-dGMP and 8-oxo-GMP, respectively. GTP was also hydrolyzed by the enzyme preparations under the same conditions; however, the autoradiographic profile of the fast-moving radioactive materials was smeary, probably due to the instability of 2,5-diamino-6-hydroxy-4-(5-phosphoribosylamino)-pyrimidine (21Foor F. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3545-3551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a product of the reaction of GTP with GCHII. dGTP was not totally hydrolyzed by GCHII or His-tag GCHII. Fig. 3 shows the results of reactions of GCHII with various nucleotides at 20 μm. 8-Oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP were hydrolyzed efficiently at almost the same rates. GTP was cleaved at a lower rate, but dGTP was not hydrolyzed. Based on these results, we calculated the kinetic values for 8-oxo-dGTP, 8-oxo-GTP, and GTP (Table II). The apparentK m values for hydrolysis of 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP were 30 and 21 μm, respectively. K m of GTP is 29 μm, consistent with the value calculated previously by Foot and Brown (21Foor F. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3545-3551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Table IIKinetics of hydrolysis by GCHIISubstrateK mK catμmmin8-Oxo-dGTP3011.98-Oxo-GTP214.0GTP291.2The K m and K cat were obtained from double-reciprocal plots by measuring the radioactivity of the monophosphate product.

Open table in a new tab The K m and K cat were obtained from double-reciprocal plots by measuring the radioactivity of the monophosphate product. The reactions were carried out at substrate concentrations ranging from 15 to 100 μm using 1.7 ng/μl GCHII at the final concentration. We next analyzed the reaction products by HPLC. The retention volume on HPLC of the product of hydrolysis of 8-oxo-dGTP by GCHII was 11 ml, which corresponds to that of an authentic 8-oxo-dGMP sample (data not shown). The retention volume of the product of 8-oxo-GTP hydrolysis by GCHII was also the same as that for 8-oxo-GMP (data not shown). It is evident, therefore, that GCHII possesses a pyrophosphatase activity for 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP, in addition to the previously demonstrated cyclohydrolase/pyrophosphatase activity for GTP. Spontaneous mutation frequency of ribA − strain (JC7623ribA −) is as low as that of wild-type strain, JC7623 (Table III). Thus, under the mutT+ background, RibA exerts no significant effect on mutation frequency. However, when bacteria lack MutT protein, an effect of ribA deficiency was observed. Spontaneous mutation frequencies of ribA − mutT − strain were 2.5 to 4 times higher than those of mutT − strain, with two different characters. This result may be taken as evidence that the GCHII protein can substitute the MutT function in vivo, although its efficiency is relatively low.Table IIIMutation frequencies of ribA-deficient strainsStrainMutation frequenciesRifr/108 cellsSmr/108 cellsT-198 mutT−50.2 ± 38.6116.8 ± 63.9T-198R mutT−ribA−123.2 ± 66.9497.2 ± 169.2JC76230.67 ± 0.25JC7623ribA::Km0.32 ± 0.29Mean values of mutation frequencies were calculated from at least five independent experiments.

Tanooka H. Nishimura S. Gann. 1984; 75: 1037-1039PubMed Google Scholar, 33Ames B.N. Gold L.S. Mutat. Res. 1991; 250: 3-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). This modified base can pair with cytosine and adenine with an almost equal efficiency and thus has the potential to induce G:C → T:A transversion (5Shibutani S. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Nature. 1991; 349: 431-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (2047) Google Scholar, 6Moriya M. Ou C. Bodepudi V. Johnson F. Takeshita M. Grollman A.P. Mutat. Res. 1991; 254: 281-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Oxidation of guanine also occurs in the cellular nucleotide pool, and 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP thus formed can be incorporated in DNA and RNA, respectively. MutT protein of E. coli degrades 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP to the corresponding nucleoside monophosphates (11Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar, 34Taddei F. Hayakawa H. Bouton M. Cirinesi A. Matic I. Sekiguchi M. Radman M. Science. 1997; 278: 128-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar), thereby preventing occurrence of transversion mutations as well as of transcription errors. Considering the significant roles of MutT protein in DNA replication as well as transcription, we think that a cell might be equipped with a mechanism that can substitute the MutT function. With this in mind, we initiated screening of an E. coli genomic DNA library, prepared from mutT-deficient strain to clone a gene with an ability to suppress the mutT mutation. The gene isolated turned out to be the ribA gene, encoding GTP cyclohydrolase II, which functions at the first step of riboflavin biosynthesis. The RibA protein indeed has an ability to hydrolyze 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP to the corresponding nucleoside monophosphates, providing the biochemical basis for this unexpected finding. It should be stressed that the RibA protein does not hydrolyze dGTP under the conditions tested (Figs. 2 and 3). The RibA protein, therefore, can specifically degrade the potent mutagenic substrate, 8-oxo-dGTP. The K m for 8-oxo-dGTP of GCHII is 30 μm, a value considerably higher as compared with that of the MutT protein, being 0.48 μm (11Maki H. Sekiguchi M. Nature. 1992; 355: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (792) Google Scholar). Since the concentration of 8-oxo-dGTP in the cellular nucleotide pool is extremely low, it seems that the role of RibA protein in control of mutation frequency in E. coli cells may be rather limited. Indeed, the ribA mutation afforded no increase in spontaneous mutation frequency of the mutT +cells. However, in the mutT − background theribA deficiency causes increased frequencies in spontaneous mutation. The antimutagenic effect of RibA was further evident when the gene product was overproduced in mutT − cells. Under ordinary conditions, MutT protein exerts almost exclusively its function to degrade the mutagenic substrate, 8-oxo-dGTP; however, in the absence of MutT or under specific conditions such as increased reactive oxygen species, GCHII may function to protect the genetic material. Recently, Koh et al. (35Koh Y.-S. Choih J. Lee J.-H. Roe J.-H. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 251: 591-598PubMed Google Scholar) reported that theribA gene is inducible by redox-cycling compounds under regulation of the soxRS system of E. coli. Médigue et al. (36Médigue C. Rouxel T. Vigier P. Hénaut A. Danchin A. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 851-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar) suggested that the mutTgene may be one of the exogenous genes, since its codon usage is different from other E. coli genes. The ribAgene, on the other hand, exhibits the ordinary codon usage and may be authentic. It can be inferred that the ancestral RibA protein might function to eliminate oxidized forms of guanine nucleotides during the early evolutionary phase when oxygen tension was relatively low. OnceE. coli acquires a strong anti-mutator mutT to adapt to the aerobic state, the biological role of the ribAgene might be restricted, e.g. biosynthesis of riboflavin. The amino acid sequence for the GCHII shows no similarity with that for the MutT nor has specific motif such as MutT box. Thus, the mechanism for hydrolysis of 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP by GCHII is different from that of MutT protein. In the biosynthesis of riboflavin, GTP is first converted to an imidazole ring-opened dephosphorylated compound, 2,5-diamino-6-hydroxy-4-(5-phosphoribosylamino)-pyrimidine. This reaction, accompanying the release of formate and pyrophosphate, is catalyzed by GCHII itself (21Foor F. Brown G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 3545-3551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). How is this reaction related to hydrolysis of 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP? The GCHII protein may catalyze two types of reactions, one hydrolyzing the α-β phosphoryl bond and the other cleaving the C-8—N-9 bond of the imidazole ring, the latter being associated with release of formate (Fig. 4). In the case of 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP, in which the C-8 position is oxidized, the ring opening reaction would not occur, leaving only the dephosphorylation reaction. In hydrolysis of GTP, 2-amino-6-hydroxy-4-(5-triphosphoribosylamino)-5-formamidopyrimidine may be produced as an intermediate of the imidazole ring opening reaction (compound 3 in Fig. 4). A more complicated mode of the reaction with GTP, as compared with those of the oxidized counterparts, 8-oxo-GTP and 8-oxo-dGTP, may explain the requirement of larger number of enzyme molecules for the former (see Fig. 3). It is well known that the MutM protein of E. coli removes both 8-oxo-G and 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-(N-methylformamido)-pyrimidine (Fapy), the imidazole ring opened structure at C-8—-N-9, from DNA by its glycosylase activity (7Michaels M.L. Cruz C. Grollman A.P. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7022-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar, 10Yamamoto K. Uraki F. Yonei S. Yukawa O. J. Radiat. Res. 1997; 38: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The structure of Fapy is similar to that of 2-amino-6-hydroxy-4-(5-triphosphoribosylamino)-5-formamidopyrimidine. As MutM recognizes both 8-oxo-G and Fapy in DNA, GCHII might recognize compound 3, 8-oxo-dGTP and 8-oxo-GTP, as well. It is highly probable that 8-oxoguanine-related mutagenesis is an important part of spontaneous mutagenesis in higher organisms and that similar systems address the threat of oxidation of guanine residues. An 8-oxo-dGTPase similar to MutT protein is present in mammalian cells, and the gene responsible was named MTH1 for mutThomologue (12Hayakawa H. Taketomi A. Sakumi K. Kuwano M. Sekiguchi M.

It is of interest to see whether the protein responsible has some sequence homology with GCHII even though mammalian cells are devoid of an ability to synthesize riboflavin. We thank M. J.

This strategy appeared particularly attractive since hormone stimulation of the V1a receptor has virtually no effect on intracellular cAMP levels.

More detailed mutational analysis of this receptor region showed that two polar V2 receptor residues, Gln225 and Glu231, play key roles in Gs recognition. In addition, a short sequence at the N terminus of the cytoplasmic tail was found to make an important contribution to V2 receptor/Gs coupling selectivity.

G protein-coupled receptor [Arg8]vasopressin four intracellular domains of G protein-coupled receptors inositol monophosphate the N-terminal portion of the i3 domain phosphatidylinositol the seven transmembrane domains of GPCRs. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs)1 form one of the largest protein families found in nature (1Watson S. Arkinstall S. Watson S. Arkinstall S. The G-Protein Linked Receptor—Facts Book. Academic Press, London1994: 1-291Google Scholar). Structurally, all GPCRs are characterized by the presence of seven transmembrane helices (TM I–VII) connected by three extracellular and three intracellular loops (i1–i3). By binding to the extracellular surface of GPCRs, ligands induce conformational changes in the receptor proteins, enabling them to interact with a distinct set of heterotrimeric G proteins that are attached to the intracellular side of the plasma membrane (2Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar, 3Savarese T.M. Fraser C.M. Biochem.

GPCR ligands display a remarkable degree of structural diversity, including, for example, small biogenic amines, large glycoprotein hormones, lipids, calcium ions, and polypeptides (7Schwartz T.W. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1994; 5: 434-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). GPCRs activated by peptide ligands are particularly abundant, reflecting their involvement in an extraordinarily large number of important physiological processes. In most cases, ligand-activated GPCRs interact with only a limited number of potential G protein coupling partners (2Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar, 3Savarese T.M. Fraser C.M. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 4Strader C.D. Fong T.M.

The structural basis underlying this coupling selectivity is currently being investigated by many different laboratories. Structure-function analysis of different classes of biogenic amine GPCRs including the muscarinic acetylcholine (8Wess J. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1996; 10: 69-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar) and adrenergic receptors (2Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev.

Neurosci. 1992; 15: 87-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) has led to considerable insight into the structural elements that control the G protein-coupling selectivity of this class of receptors. Such studies have shown that multiple intracellular receptor regions including the i2 loop, the N- and C-terminal portions of the i3 domain, and the membrane-proximal segment of the C-terminal tail (i4) are involved in determining the specificity of receptor/G protein coupling. Particularly in the case of the muscarinic receptor family (m1–m5), the amino acids dictating the signaling selectivity of the different receptor subtypes have been mapped in great detail (8Wess J.

In contrast, the molecular mechanisms governing the coupling selectivity of GPCRs activated by peptide ligands are not well understood at present. Studies to explore these mechanisms are hampered by the fact that the individual members of a given peptide receptor family usually couple to similar sets of G proteins. All members of the neurokinin, cholecystokinin, endothelin, and bombesin receptor families, for example, are preferentially coupled to G proteins of the Gq/11 family, whereas the various opioid and somatostatin receptor subtypes are all selectively linked to G proteins of the Gi/Go class (1Watson S. Arkinstall S. Watson S. Arkinstall S. The G-Protein Linked Receptor—Facts Book. Academic Press, London1994: 1-291Google Scholar). Thus, this pattern has severely limited the use of hybrid receptor approaches (which have been instrumental in mapping functionally critical domains in non-peptide GPCRs) to identify peptide receptor sites that are critical for G protein recognition. However, the vasopressin peptide receptor family (which consists of three subtypes, V1a, V1b, and V2) offers an attractive model system to study mechanisms involved in peptide receptor-coupling selectivity, since the individual members of this class of receptors clearly differ in their G protein preference. Whereas the V1a and V1b receptors are selectively coupled to G proteins of the Gq/11 family, which mediate the breakdown of phosphatidylinositol (PI) lipids, the V2 receptor preferentially activates the G protein Gs, resulting in the activation of adenylyl cyclase (13Birnbaumer M.

The V1a and V1b receptors are involved in a number of important central and peripheral processes, whereas the V2 receptor is required for water reabsorption in the renal collecting duct system (19Laszlo F.A. Laszlo Jr., F. De Wied D. Pharmacol. Rev. 1991; 43: 73-108PubMed Google Scholar). Several laboratories have shown that mutations in the V2 receptor gene are responsible for the X-linked form of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (reviewed in Refs. 20Birnbaumer M. J. Recept. Signal Transduct. Res. 1995; 151: 131-160Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar and 21Spiegel A.M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1996; 58: 143-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). In an initial study (22Liu J. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8772-8778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), we have recently employed a hybrid receptor strategy to broadly map V1a and V2 receptor domains determining the coupling properties of these two receptor subtypes. We found that the relative functional importance of individual intracellular loops differs among the two vasopressin receptor subtypes. Efficient coupling to Gq/11 by the wild type V1a or hybrid V1a/V2 receptors was found to be critically dependent on the presence of V1a receptor sequence in the i2 loop, whereas efficient recognition of Gs by the wild type V2 receptor or V1a/V2 mutant receptors required the presence of V2 receptor sequence in the i3 loop (22Liu J. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8772-8778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). The present study was designed to study the structural basis underlying the ability of the V2 receptor to selectively couple to Gsin greater molecular detail, by using a gain-of-function mutagenesis approach. Specifically, we systematically substituted distinct segments/single amino acids of the V2 receptor sequence into the V1a receptor subtype, and then studied the resulting hybrid receptors for their ability to mediate increases in intracellular cAMP levels. This strategy appeared particularly attractive since the wild type V1a receptor essentially offers a “null background,” i.e.ligand stimulation of this receptor subtype has virtually no effect on intracellular cAMP levels (22Liu J. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8772-8778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In this report, we describe the identification of residues at the TM V/i3 loop and TM VII/i4 domain junctions that are intimately involved in V2 receptor/Gs coupling selectivity. Moreover, we made the novel observation that receptor/Gs coupling selectivity can be regulated simply by the length (rather than the presence of a distinct amino acid sequence) of the central portion of the i3 loop. To generate hybrid V1a/V2 vasopressin receptor constructs, expression plasmids coding for the rat V1a receptor, V1pcD-SP6/T7 (14Morel A. O'Carroll A.-M. Brownstein M.J. Lolait S.J. Nature. 1992; 356: 523-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar), and the human V2 receptor, V2pcD-PS (22Liu J. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8772-8778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), were used. The wild type V2 receptor construct contained a nine-amino acid hemagglutinin epitope tag (YPYDVPDYA) inserted after the initiating methionine codon. Previous studies showed that the ligand-binding and G protein-coupling properties of the epitope-tagged wild type V2 receptor did not differ significantly from those found with the nontagged version (22Liu J. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8772-8778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 23Schöneberg T. Yun J. Wenkert D. Wess J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1283-1291Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To facilitate the construction of V1a/V2 mutant receptors, the following silent restriction sites were introduced into the V1a receptor expression plasmid: SpeI (codons 173/174), BspEI (codons 224/225), KpnI (codons 235/236), and Eco47III (codons 304/305). Chimeric V1a/V2 receptor genes were constructed by using standard polymerase chain reaction mutagenesis techniques (24Higuchi R. Erlich H.A. PCR Technology. Stockton Press, New York1989: 61-70Crossref Google Scholar). The precise amino acid composition of the individual V1a/V2 hybrid receptors is given in Table I (see also Fig. 1). The correctness of all polymerase chain reaction-derived sequences was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing of the mutant plasmids.Table IAmino acid composition of V1a/V2 hybrid vasopressin receptors used in this studyChimeric receptorV1a receptor residues replaced with V2 receptor sequenceCR 1V1a(Tyr238–Phe300)→ V2 (Gln225–Leu274)CR 2V1a(Val153–Ala172) → V2 (Ile141–Leu161) and Vla (Tyr238–Phe300) → V2 (Gln225–Leu274)CR 3V1a (Tyr238–Phe300) → V2 (Gln225–Leu274) and Vla (Cys349–Thr424) → V2 (Thr320–Ser371)CR 4V1a (Cys349–Thr424) → V2 (Thr320–Ser371)CR 5V1a (Cys349–Pro370) → V2 (Thr320–Leu340)CR 6V1a (Phe369–Thr424) → V2 (Leu339–Ser371)CR 7V1a (Tyr238–Phe300) → V2 (Gln225–Leu274) and Vla (Cys349–Pro370) → V2 (Thr320–Leu340)CR 8V1a (Tyr238–Val278) → V2 (Gln225–Gly254)CR 9V1a (Lys252–Phe300) → V2 (Gly239–Leu274)CR 10V1a (Ser284–Phe300) → V2 (Pro256–Leu274)CR 11V1a (Tyr238–Ser255) → V2 (Gln225–Glu242)CR 12V1a (Tyr238–Ile249) → V2 (Gln225–Leu236)CR 13V1a (Tyr238–Val278) → V2 (Gln225–Gly254) and Vla (Cys349–Thr424) → V2 (Thr320–Ser371)CR 14V1a (Ser284–Thr424) → V2 (Pro256–Ser371)CR 15V1a (Tyr238–Gly239) → V2 (Gln225–Val226)CR 16V1a (Cys242–His244) → V2 (Phe229–Glu231)CR 17V1a (Trp246–Asn248) → V2 (His233–Ser235)CR 18V1a (Tyr238–Gly239) → V2 (Gln225–Val226) and V1a (Lys252–Phe300) → V2 (Gly239–Leu274)CR 19V1a (Cys242–His244) → V2 (Phe229–Glu231) and V1a (Lys252–Phe300) → V2 (Gly239–Leu274)CR 20V1a (Trp246–Asn248) → V2 (His233–Ser235) and V1a (Lys252–Phe300) → V2 (Gly239–Leu274)CR 22V1a (Gly239–Val278) → V2 (Val226–Gly254)CR 23V1a (Tyr238) → V2 (Gln225) and V1a (Phe240–Val278) → (Leu227–Gly254)CR 24V1a (Tyr238–Phe240) → V2 (Gln225–Leu227) and V1a (Tyr243–Val278) → V2 (Arg230–Gly254)CR 25V1a (Tyr238–Cys242) → V2 (Gln225–Phe229) and V1a (His244–Val278) → V2 (Glu231–Gly254)CR 26V1a (Tyr238–Tyr243) → V2 (Gln225–Arg230) and V1a (Trp246–Val278) → V2 (His233–Gly254)CR 27V1a (Tyr238–Ile249) → V2 (Gln225–Leu236) and V1a (His258–Val278) → V2 (Gly245–Gly254)CR 28V1a (Tyr238–Ile249) → V2 (Gln225–Leu236) and V1a (His258–Val278) → GGAAAGRRTGCR 29V1a (Tyr238–Ile249) → V2 (Gln225–Leu236) and V1a (His258–Val278) → GGRRRGAATGCR 30V1a (Tyr238–Ile249) → V2 (Gln225–Leu236) and V1a (His258–Val278) → AARRRARRAACR 31V1a (Tyr238–Ile249) → V2 (Gln225–Leu236) and V1a (His258–Val278) → AAAAAAAAAACR 32V1a (Tyr258–Val278) → V2 (Gly245–Gly254)CR 33V1a (Tyr238–Ser255) → V2 (Gln225–Glu242) and V1a (Thr279–Phe300) → V2 (Ser255–Leu274)Numbers refer to amino acid positions in the rat V1a (14Morel A.

COS-7 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator. For transfections, 1 × 106 cells were seeded into 100-mm dishes. About 24 h later, cells were transfected with the various vasopressin receptor constructs (4 μg of plasmid DNA per dish) by a DEAE-dextran method (25Cullen B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 152: 684-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (662) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with 900 μl of the DNA/DEAE-dextran (10 mg/ml) mixture for 3 h. For radioligand binding studies, COS-7 cells were harvested approximately 70–72 h after transfections, and membrane homogenates were prepared as described previously (26Dörje F. Wess J. Lambrecht G. Tacke R. Mutschler E. Brann M.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1991; 256: 727-733PubMed Google Scholar). Binding buffer consisted of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1 mg/ml bacitracin. Incubations were carried out for 1 h at room temperature (22 °C) in the presence of the radioligand, [3H]arginine vasopressin ([3H]AVP, 59 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products), in a 0.5-ml volume. For saturation binding studies, six different concentrations of [3H]AVP (0.125–4 nm) were used. Nonspecific binding was assessed in the presence of 5 μm AVP. Protein concentrations were determined according to Bradford (27Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216334) Google Scholar). Binding data were analyzed by a nonlinear least squares curve-fitting procedure, using the computer program LIGAND (28Munson P.J. Rodbard D. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 107: 220-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (7771) Google Scholar). Approximately 20–24 h after transfections, COS-7 cells were transferred into six-well plates (about 0.3–0.4 × 106 cells/well), and 2 μCi/ml [3H]adenine (18 Ci/mmol; American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc.) was added to the growth medium. After a 20–24-h labeling period, cells were preincubated in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 20 mm Hepes and 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine for 20 min (37 °C) and then stimulated with 1 μm AVP for 30 min at 37 °C (total volume per well, 1 ml). To generate complete concentration-response curves, seven different concentrations of AVP (ranging from 10−13 to 10−6m) were used. Incubations were terminated by aspiration of medium and addition of 1 ml of ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 1 mm ATP and 1 mm cAMP. Increases in intracellular [3H]cAMP levels were then determined by anion exchange chromatography as described previously (29Salomon Y. Londos C. Rodbell M. Anal.

After a 20–24-h labeling period, cells were preincubated for 20 min at room temperature with 2 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 20 mm HEPES and 10 mm LiCl. Cells were then stimulated with 1 μmAVP for 1 h at 37 °C (total volume per well, 1 ml), and increases in intracellular inositol monophosphate (IP1) levels were determined by anion exchange chromatography as described elsewhere (9Blin N.

When transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, the wild type V2 vasopressin receptor, upon stimulation with the hormone AVP, produced a pronounced increase in intracellular cAMP levels (11 ± 1-fold above basal; EC50 = 0.56 ± 0.14 nm), whereas the V1a vasopressin receptor was unable to mediate an appreciable increase in adenylyl cyclase activity (Figs. 2 and 3, Tables II and III). To elucidate the structural basis underlying this selectivity, we employed a gain-of-function mutagenesis approach. Distinct segments/amino acids of the V2 receptor sequence were substituted into the V1a receptor subtype, and the resulting hybrid receptors were then examined for their ability to mediate increases in intracellular cAMP levels. All studies were carried out with COS-7 cells transiently expressing the different wild type and mutant vasopressin receptors.Figure 3Concentration-response curves for CR1- and CR7-mediated stimulation of adenylyl cyclase.

For B max values, see Table II. ND, not determinable with sufficient accuracy. [3H]AVP binding studies showed that most of the mutant receptors were expressed at levels comparable to those found with the two wild type receptors (Table II). In only a few rare cases (e.g. CR2), B max values were found to be strongly reduced (see below for details). We demonstrated in a previous study (22Liu J. Wess J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8772-8778Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) that a mutant V1a receptor (CR1) in which the i3 loop (Tyr238–Phe300; Fig. 1) was replaced with the corresponding V2 receptor sequence (Gln225–Leu274; Fig. 1) gained the ability to stimulate adenylyl cyclase with high efficacy (Figs. 2 and 3; Table III). This observation suggested that the i3 loop of the V2 receptor contains major structural elements determining the coupling selectivity of this receptor subtype. However, we also noted that the maximum cAMP response mediated by CR1 was about 25% smaller than that observed with the wild type V2 receptor (Figs. 2 and 3; Table III), suggesting that other V2 receptor domains, besides the i3 loop, are also critical for optimum Gs coupling efficiency. Molecular genetic and biochemical studies with biogenic amine receptors and other classes of GPCRs have shown that residues within the i2 loop and portions of the cytoplasmic tail (i4) also contribute to G protein coupling (2Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar, 3Savarese T.M. Fraser C.M. Biochem.

The plasmid-encoded class A TEM-1 β-lactamase is a commonly encountered β-lactamase. It is able to inactivate penicillins and cephalosporins but not extended-spectrum antibiotics. However, TEM-1-derived natural variants containing the G238S amino acid substitution display increased hydrolysis of extended-spectrum antibiotics. Two models have been proposed to explain the role of the G238S substitution in hydrolysis of extended-spectrum antibiotics. The first proposes a direct hydrogen bond of the Ser238side chain to the oxime group of extended-spectrum antibiotics. The second proposes that steric conflict with surrounding residues, due to increased side chain volume, leads to a more accessible active site pocket. To assess the validity of each model, TEM-1 mutants with amino acids substitutions of Ala, Ser, Cys, Thr, Asn, and Val have been constructed. Kinetic analysis of these enzymes with penicillins and cephalosporins suggests that a hydrogen bond is necessary but not sufficient to achieve the hydrolytic activity of the G238S enzyme for the extended-spectrum antibiotics cefotaxime and ceftazidime. In addition, it appears that the new hydrogen bond interaction is to a site on the enzyme rather than directly to the extended-spectrum antibiotic. The data indicate that, for the G238S substitution, a combination of an optimal side chain volume and hydrogen bonding potential results in the most versatile and advantageous antibiotic hydrolytic spectrum for bacterial resistance to extended-spectrum antibiotics. β-Lactamases inactivate β-lactam antibiotics by catalyzing the hydrolysis of the amide bond in the β-lactam ring.

Bacterial resistance to β-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins, is primarily mediated by the production of β-lactamases, which catalyze the hydrolysis of β-lactam antibiotics to inactive products (1Bush K. Jacoby G.A. Medeiros A. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1211-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (2123) Google Scholar). TEM-1 β-lactamase is one of the most common plasmid-mediated β-lactamases in Gram-negative bacteria. It has a broad spectrum of hydrolytic activity that includes penicillins and cephalosporins, but not extended-spectrum antibiotics (2Wiedemann B. Kliebe C. Kresken M. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1989; 24: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Extended-spectrum cephalosporins were developed, in part, because of the ability of β-lactamases, such as TEM-1, to efficiently hydrolyze older penicillins and cephalosporins. These drugs, due to their larger side chains, were able to avoid inactivation by the TEM-1 enzyme. Unfortunately, after the introduction of extended-spectrum cephalosporins, clinical isolates were discovered containing TEM variants with active site mutations that allowed for hydrolysis of these antibiotics (3Knox J.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2593-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). One particular amino acid substitution, a serine for glycine at position 238 in the active site, appears in natural variants of both the TEM and SHV (another common plasmid-encoded enzyme with 68% homology to TEM-1) enzymes and provides bacterial resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins. This substitution alone, or in combination with other substitutions, can provide clinically relevant levels of resistance (3Knox J.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2593-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). Two types of models have been proposed to explain the effectiveness of the G238S substitution in the hydrolysis of extended-spectrum cephalosporins (4Saves I. Burlet-Schiltz O. Maveyraud L. Samama J.-P. Prome J.-C. Masson J.-M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11660-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 5Labia R. Morand A. Tiwari K. Sirot J. Sirot D. Petit A. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1988; 10: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 6Huletsky A. Knox J.R. Levesque R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3690-3697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first model involves a hydrogen bond between the serine residue and the oxime group of extended-spectrum cephalosporins (Fig. 1 A) (5Labia R. Morand A. Tiwari K. Sirot J. Sirot D. Petit A. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1988; 10: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This hydrogen bond would improve affinity of the enzyme for the antibiotic, and consequently improve the catalytic efficiency. The second model suggests that the serine residue, due to steric conflict with either residues 69 or 170, would improve affinity through an active site cavity expansion either by shifting the position of the B3 β-strand (Fig. 1 B) (6Huletsky A. Knox J.R. Levesque R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3690-3697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or shifting the position of an active site omega loop (Fig. 1 C) (4Saves I. Burlet-Schiltz O. Maveyraud L. Samama J.-P. Prome J.-C. Masson J.-M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11660-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), either of which would then allow extended-spectrum antibiotics more space to bind. Thus, the “steric conflict” models are also based on improving affinity for the antibiotic, but indirectly by altering the shape of the active site as opposed to the direct hydrogen bond interaction with substrate proposed in the first model. To study the role of residue 238 and test the mechanisms proposed by the two types of models, a series of mutants (Ala, Ser, Cys, Thr, Asn, and Val) were constructed at position 238 with increasing side chain volume and alternating hydrogen bonding capabilities. The expectation for the first model is that only hydrogen bonding residues (Ser, Asn, and Thr) will provide an increase in the catalytic efficiency of extended-spectrum cephalosporins relative to the wild-type glycine residue. The expectation for the second model is that an increase in catalytic efficiency will follow an increase in side chain volume. Kinetic analysis of these enzymes shows that the hydrogen- bonding amino acids (Ser, Asn, and Thr) do provide an increase in hydrolysis of the extended-spectrum cephalosporins, with the G238S enzyme providing the largest increase. Interestingly, increases in catalytic efficiency observed with hydrogen-bonding amino acids are not limited to substrates containing a hydrogen bond acceptor, suggesting that an intramolecular hydrogen bond is formed to another site in the enzyme or to a structural water molecule. These results indicate that a hydrogen-bonding amino acid at position 238 is necessary but not sufficient to increase the hydrolysis of extended-spectrum cephalosporins to an extent that is clinically relevant (i.e. G238S). The Ala substitution also provides an increase in the hydrolysis of extended-spectrum cephalosporins relative to the wild-type enzyme. Therefore, the side chain volume of residue 238 does play a role in the hydrolysis of these antibiotics. From these results, it appears that only the Ser substitution combines a new intramolecular hydrogen bond interaction with an optimal increase in side chain volume resulting in a β-lactamase with significant levels of hydrolysis of extended-spectrum cephalosporins. The greater versatility of the Ser substitution over other amino acid substitutions in effecting these changes may explain why it is the only substitution seen at residue 238 in extended-spectrum β-lactamases.

Ampicillin, benzylpenicillin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, and cefotaxime were purchased from Sigma. Ceftazidime was provided by Glaxo. Nitrocefin was purchased from Becton Dickinson. G-75 Sephadex was obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. E. coliBW313 (Hfr lysA(61–62), dut1, ung1, thi1, relA1 spoT1) strain was used for the preparation of single-stranded plasmid DNA prior to mutagenesis (7Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A.

Fernandez J.M. Short J.M. BioTechniques. 1987; 5: 376-379Google Scholar). E. coli SB646 (ΔfhuA Δptr ΔdegP ΔompT Δprc::kan) is a protease-deficient strain that was used for expression and purification of mutants G238S, G238C, G238T, G238N, and G238V. This strain was a gift from Steve Bass. The plasmid pBG66, described in previous studies (10Palzkill T. Botstein D. Proteins. 1992; 14: 29-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), was used for mutagenesis. The pBG66 plasmid contains the wild-typebla TEM-1 gene and a cat gene, which encodes for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase. The 4.8-kilobase pair plasmid also contains the ColE1 and f1 origins of DNA replication. The G238A, G238C, G238T, G238N, G238V mutants were constructed in the pBG66 plasmid by Kunkel mutagenesis (7Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). The G238S mutant was selected directly from the L237–240 random library as a single substitution from an ampicillin antibiotic selection. 1C. Cantu III and T. Palzkill, unpublished data.Oligonucleotide primers used for mutagenesis and DNA sequencing were synthesized by the oligonucleotide synthesis facility at Genentech, Inc., at Stanford University Medical School, and at Genosys Biotechnologies, Inc. Single-stranded plasmid DNA was prepared for sequencing as described previously (11Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 4.26Google Scholar). DNA sequencing was performed using the dideoxy chain termination method (12Sanger T. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52674) Google Scholar). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs)2 were determined by broth microdilution as described previously (13Cantu III, C. Huang W. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22538-22545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The ranges of antibiotic concentrations (2-fold increases) tested were: 128–5000 μg/ml for ampicillin and benzylpenicillin (concentrations increased 2-fold between 128 and 4096 μg/ml; 3000 and 5000 μg/ml concentrations were added for increased sensitivity), 8–1024 μg/ml for cephaloridine and cephalothin, 0.03–4 μg/ml for cefotaxime, and 0.12–16 μg/ml for ceftazidime. TEM-1 and the residue 238 mutant β-lactamases were purified to >90% homogeneity. The wild-type TEM-1 and G238A enzymes were purified from E. coli XL1-Blue cells, and the G238S, G238C, G238T, G238N, and G238V enzymes were purified from E. coli SB646 cells. All β-lactamases described were expressed from the pBG66 plasmid that contains the natural β-lactamase promoter. The E. coli SB646 cells were used to increase protein yield for the respective mutants. These strains were grown in culture for at least 8 h to late log phase. The β-lactamase protein was purified as described previously (14Cantu III, C. Huang W. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29144-29150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The purity of the enzymes was verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The kinetics of TEM-1 β-lactamase and the residue 238 mutants were determined with ampicillin, benzylpenicillin, cephaloridine, cephalothin, cefotaxime, and ceftazidime. The extinction coefficients used were: ampicillin, 235 nm, Δε = 900m−1 cm−1; benzylpenicillin, 233 nm, Δε = 1,140 m−1 cm−1; cephaloridine, 260 nm, Δε = 10,200 m−1cm−1; cephalothin, 262 nm, Δε = 7,660m−1 cm−1; cefotaxime, 264 nm, Δε = 7,250 m−1 cm−1 (15Minami S. Yotsuji A. Inoue M. Misuhashi S. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1980; 18: 382-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), ceftazidime, 260 nm, Δε = 8,660 m−1cm−1 (16Bush K. Freudenberger J.S. Sykes R.B. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1982; 22: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of the substrates was monitored, and kinetic parameters V max and K m were determined as described previously (14Cantu III, C. Huang W. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29144-29150Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Thek cat/K m values for the enzymes where k cat and K mcould not be determined independently were estimated using the equation ν = (k cat/K m)[E][S], where [S] ≪ K m (17Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1985: 99Google Scholar). The values reported are based on velocity measurements at 25, 50, and/or 100 μmsubstrate concentrations. The “hydrogen bond to substrate” model for the role of residue 238 would predict that, out of the residues tested in this study, only Ser, Thr, and Asn would provide increases in catalytic efficiency of the TEM enzyme for extended-spectrum antibiotics while the “steric conflict” model would predict a direct correlation between an increase in the side chain volume of residue 238 and an increase in catalytic efficiency of the enzyme for extended-spectrum antibiotics. Informational suppression studies done at residue 238 have shown that the G238A and G238T single mutants have increased cefotaxime hydrolytic activity (18Lenfant F. Labia R. Masson J.-M. Biochimie (Paris). 1990; 72: 495-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), but only the G238S single mutant has been purified to homogeneity and kinetically characterized (19Venkatachalam K.V. Huang W. LaRocco M. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23444-23450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To test the models, a series of substitutions with increasing amino acid side chain volume and alternating hydrogen bonding capability (20Creighton T.E. Proteins:Structures and Molecular Properties. W. H. Freeman and Company, New York1993: 7Google Scholar) were constructed at position 238 (Table I). For a measure of the biological effect of these substitutions, MICs were determined (Table II) for each mutant with the following substrates: two penicillins (ampicillin and benzylpenicillin), two first generation (nonextended-spectrum) cephalosporins (cephaloridine and cephalothin), and two extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ceftazidime and cefotaxime) (Fig. 2). While the G238S mutant provides a broad spectrum of hydrolytic activity as well as the highest MIC values for the extended-spectrum antibiotics, the G238A, G238T, and G238N mutants have nearly the same hydrolytic activity spectrum, including the extended-spectrum antibiotics, suggesting that these substitutions may be as effective as the Ser substitution in overall antibiotic resistance (Table II). To more clearly determine the effect of each substitution, kinetic analysis was done for each mutant with the six substrates. Because antibiotic resistance, as measured by MICs, has been directly correlated with the catalytic efficiency of the respective antibiotic inactivating enzyme (21Radika K. Northrop D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1984; 25: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the primary focus of the results will be on thek cat/K m values. The linear correlation of the catalytic efficiency of the wild-type TEM-1 β-lactamase versus MIC value provided by the enzyme for a given antibiotic is shown in Fig. 3.Table IAmino acid properties of residue 238 mutantsResidue 238Amino acid volumeHydrogen-bonding abilityÅGly (wild-type)48NoneAla67NoneSer73GoodCys86PoorThr93GoodAsn96GoodVal105NoneAmino acid properties are from Creighton (20Creighton T.E.

Kinetic analysis of the G238A enzyme for penicillins and cephalosporins revealed k cat/K m values equivalent to the wild-type enzyme for the cephalosporins but at least 2-fold less for the penicillins (Table III). For the extended-spectrum cephalosporins, the overall effect of the G238A substitution is to increase the catalytic efficiency relative to the wild-type enzyme for both cefotaxime (e.g. 2.77 × 103 versus 3.00 × 104) and ceftazidime (e.g. 5.51 × 101 versus1.77 × 102) (Table III, Fig. 4). These results indicate that a new hydrogen bond interaction is not required to increase hydrolysis of these antibiotics, and therefore provide support for the “steric conflict” model.Table IIIKinetic parameters for TEM-1 β-lactamase and its mutantsMICTEM-1G238AG238SG238CG238TG238NG238Vk cat (s −1) AMP1428 ± 24129 ± 67 ± 168 ± 1816 ± 112 ± 514 ± 1 PENG1284 ± 2091 ± 33.9 ± 0.447 ± 463 ± 1426 ± 317 ± 2 CLR947 ± 9149 ± 186 ± 121 ± 580 ± 1425 ± 521 ± 3 CF115 ± 368 ± 253 ± 16 ± 134 ± 415 ± 25 ± 1 CTX>4.1641 ± 1916 ± 24 ± 116 ± 26 ± 1>2.45 CAZ>0.04>0.141.0 ± 0.1>0.070.16 ± 0.01>0.22>0.09K m (μm) AMP50 ± 214 ± 47 ± 3295 ± 8710 ± 39 ± 573 ± 12 PENG75 ± 810 ± 212 ± 193 ± 2847 ± 209 ± 463 ± 18 CLR697 ± 12147 ± 396 ± 2343 ± 15560 ± 2974 ± 24507 ± 75 CF347 ± 14246 ± 348 ± 5185 ± 47113 ± 13100 ± 22704 ± 187 CTX>15001442 ± 856124 ± 47824 ± 225485 ± 151244 ± 107>1500 CAZ>800>800343 ± 68>800587 ± 82>800>800k cat/K m(m−1 s−1) AMP2.86 × 1079.73 × 1061.12 × 1062.36 × 1051.69 × 1061.43 × 1061.90 × 105± 5.5 × 106± 3.05 × 106± 3.66 × 105± 5.73 × 104± 4.47 × 105± 2.62 × 105± 1.58 × 104 PENG1.71 × 1079.05 × 1063.41 × 1055.30 × 1051.47 × 1063.24 × 1062.76 × 105± 8.1 × 106± 1.87 × 106± 2.17 × 104± 1.09 × 105± 4.57 × 105± 1.14 × 106± 5.12 × 104 CLR1.36 × 1061.05 × 1061.31 × 1067.03 × 1041.50 × 1063.53 × 1054.08 × 104± 1.4 × 105± 1.94 × 105± 3.10 × 105± 2.83 × 104± 5.07 × 105± 4.12 × 104± 5.85 × 103 CF3.31 × 1052.71 × 1053.94 × 1053.06 × 1043.00 × 1051.46 × 1058.32 × 103± 3.0 × 104± 5.95 × 104± 7.70 × 104± 4.38 × 103± 1.56 × 104± 1.25 × 104± 2.59 × 103 CTX2.77 × 1033.00 × 1041.44 × 1054.91 × 1033.42 × 1042.89 × 1041.63 × 103± 6.6 × 102± 7.08 × 103± 4.91 × 104± 5.69 × 102± 5.97 × 103± 8.53 × 103± 4.02 × 102 CAZ5.51 × 1011.77 × 1023.04 × 1038.28 × 1012.75 × 1022.73 × 1021.09 × 102± 3.36 × 101± 3.41 × 102± 2.75 × 101± 3.82 × 101± 1.15 × 102± 6.89 × 101AMP, ampicillin; PENG, benzylpenicillin; CLR, cephaloridine; CF, cephalothin; CTX, cefotaxime; CAZ, ceftazidime.Data from Cantu et al.

The associated k cat/K m values are directly estimated under the condition of [S]≪K m. The associated k cat values are derived from the respectivek cat/K m values and the lower limit for the K m values. The G238S enzyme maintains wild-type levels of k cat/K m for cephalosporins, while the k cat/K m values for penicillins exhibits an approximately 10-fold decrease (2.86 × 107 versus 1.12 × 106 for AMP). This can be explained by equivalent reductions in k cat values for the penicillins and cephalosporins by the G238S enzyme, compared with the G238A enzyme, but reductions in the K m values only for the cephalosporins (Table III). For cefotaxime, as with the older cephalosporins, reduction in the k cat value is also compensated for by a reduction in K m value, resulting in approximately a 50-fold increase in thek cat/K m value (e.g. 2.77 × 103 versus1.44 × 105) (Table III, Fig. 4). A similar increase in k cat/K m is seen for ceftazidime. These results are in agreement with published values for the G238S enzyme (19Venkatachalam K.V. Huang W. LaRocco M. Palzkill T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23444-23450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the observation that the Ser residue acts the same way for extended- and nonextended-spectrum cephalosporins suggests that the new interaction introduced is not specific to the oxime group of the extended-spectrum cephalosporins as proposed in the “direct hydrogen bond to substrate” model (Fig. 1 A) (5Labia R. Morand A. Tiwari K. Sirot J. Sirot D. Petit A. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1988; 10: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The results, however, are in agreement with the predictions of the “steric conflict” model (Fig. 1, Band C) (4Saves I. Burlet-Schiltz O. Maveyraud L. Samama J.-P. Prome J.-C. Masson J.-M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11660-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 6Huletsky A. Knox J.R. Levesque R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3690-3697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) because of the increased apparent affinity for all cephalosporins as indicated by the reducedK m values (Table III). The overall effect of the G238C substitution, relative to G238S, is at least a 12-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency for the cephalosporins (e.g. 1.31 × 106 versus7.03 × 104 for cephaloridine and 3.94 × 105 versus 3.06 × 104 for cephalothin), but surprisingly little or no change in the efficiency of penicillin hydrolysis (Table III, Fig. 4). For both ceftazidime and cefotaxime hydrolysis, the catalytic efficiency of G238C is at the level of the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 4). These results are not in accordance with the “steric conflict” model. One possibility is that a limitation may have been reached in terms of the volume of the residue 238 side chain such that, for side chains larger than Ala, a hydrogen bond may be necessary for the stabilization of a new active site configuration caused by the steric conflict introduced by the larger side chains. Thus, a hydrogen bonding capability may indeed be required of the residue 238 side chain but for an intramolecular hydrogen bond interaction instead of a direct hydrogen bond to substrate interaction as originally proposed (5Labia R. Morand A. Tiwari K. Sirot J. Sirot D. Petit A. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1988; 10: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To further test the necessity of a hydrogen-bonding side chain at position 238, a Thr and Asn residue, both of which have hydrogen bonding capability and have side chains larger than Cys (Table I), were introduced. The overall effect of the G238T and G238N substitutions are increases in k cat/K m back to wild-type levels of hydrolysis for cephalosporins and to just 10-fold less than wild-type levels for penicillins (e.g. 2.86 × 107 (TEM-1) versus 1.69 × 106 (G238T) and 1.43 × 106 (G238N) for AMP, respectively) (Table III, Fig. 4). Relative to the G238C enzyme, both G238T and G238N exhibit a 10-fold increase in catalytic efficiency for the extended-spectrum cephalosporins (e.g. 4.91 × 103 (G238C) versus 3.42 × 104(G238T) and 2.89 × 104 (G238N) for cefotaxime, respectively) (Table III, Fig. 4). These results clearly support the introduction of a new intramolecular hydrogen bond interaction, as increases in catalytic efficiency are seen for all antibiotics. The results of all the mutants described thus far suggest a model in which the increased side chain volume, due to steric conflict with surrounding residues, leads to an altered active site configuration and that a intramolecular hydrogen bond is needed to stabilize such a configuration as the side chain volume is increased beyond that of alanine. To further test this model, a valine residue was introduced at position 238. Valine is similar to threonine except for having a methyl group in place of the hydroxyl group. The expectation is that the valine mutant will exhibit a decrease in catalytic efficiency for all antibiotics. In fact, a 10-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency for penicillins and cephalosporins is seen relative to the G238N and G238T enzymes (Fig. 4). The G238V enzyme displays the lowest levels of catalytic efficiency for penicillins and cephalosporins, with efficiencies 30–40-fold less than wild-type levels for the cephalosporins (e.g. 1.36 × 106 versus4.08 × 104 for cephaloridine) and 60–150-fold less for penicillins (e.g. 2.86 × 107 versus 1.90 × 105 for AMP) (Table III). The catalytic efficiency of G238V for cefotaxime and ceftazidime is at the level of the wild-type enzyme (Table III, Fig. 4). These results are in agreement with the prediction of the new model. The serine for glycine substitution has been the only one observed at position 238 in natural variants of TEM- and SHV-β-lactamase resistant to extended-spectrum antibiotics (3Knox J.R. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 2593-2601Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). The two types of models to explain the prevalence of the G238S substitution in extended-spectrum β-lactamases are: 1) the hydrogen bond to substrate model, where the introduction of a hydrogen bond between the serine hydroxyl and the oxime group of extended-spectrum antibiotics increases antibiotic affinity (Fig. 1 A) (5Labia R. Morand A. Tiwari K. Sirot J. Sirot D. Petit A. Rev. Infect. Dis. 1988; 10: 885-891Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and 2) the steric conflict model, where the introduction of steric conflict of the serine side chain and surrounding residues would lead to a larger active site cavity and increased affinity for extended-spectrum antibiotics, either by displacement of the B3 β-strand (Fig. 1 B) (6Huletsky A. Knox J.R. Levesque R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3690-3697Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or of the omega loop, which sits at the entrance of the active site (Fig. 1 C) (4Saves I. Burlet-Schiltz O. Maveyraud L. Samama J.-P. Prome J.-C. Masson J.-M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11660-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Comparison of inhibitory activities of the extended-spectrum cephalosporins for the residue 238 mutants does not distinguish between the models (Table II). In fact, the Ala, Thr, and Asn mutants have an equivalent spectrum of antibiotic sensitivity as the Ser mutant, which is contrary to the fact that only the Ser substitution appears in extended-spectrum β-lactamases. In nature, selection of the Thr or Asn substitution requires two nucleotide base pair changes in the wild-type Gly238 codon while Ser requires only one. This could explain why Ser is preferred over Thr or Asn as the residue 238 substitution in natural variants resistant to extended-spectrum antibiotics. Although the Ala substitution also requires only one nucleotide base pair change, kinetic analysis of the residue 238 mutants clearly shows that the G238S substitution provides for the best hydrolysis of extended-spectrum cephalosporins and the most versatile hydrolytic spectrum. While the antibiotic resistance provided by TEM-1 β-lactamase and most of the residue 238 mutants displays a linear correlation (r = 0.90–0.99) to the catalytic efficiency of the respective enzyme in agreement with previous studies (21Radika K. Northrop D. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1984; 25: 479-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 22Sowek J.A. Singer S.B. Ohringer S. Malley M.F. Dougherty T.J. Gougoutas J.Z. Bush K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3179-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), the correlation breaks down for the G238T mutant (r = 0.74) and the G238S mutant (r = 0.07). The reason for the breakdown in correlation is not clear but also not unique. Analysis of data from a previous study of the E104K, R164S, and E240K β-lactamase mutants indicate that, individually and in double mutant combinations, they display a linear correlation (r = 0.92–1.00) between catalytic efficiency and MIC value, but that correlation breaks down for the triple mutant (r = 0.58) (22Sowek J.A. Singer S.B. Ohringer S. Malley M.F. Dougherty T.J. Gougoutas J.Z. Bush K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 3179-3188Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, care should be taken before making assumptions of resistance based on catalytic efficiency of an antibiotic inactivating enzyme or vice versa. Nonetheless, even with the linear correlation breakdown, the G238S mutant still provides the highest values of both catalytic efficiency and MIC for the extended-spectrum cephalosporins. Understanding the factors involved in achieving its highk cat/K m values for extended-spectrum cephalosporins may provide a better understanding of the mechanism of resistance of extended-spectrum β-lactamases containing the G238S substitution. With regard to the proposed mechanistic models of the G238S substitution, the argument against there being a direct hydrogen bond between the Ser238 side chain and the oxime side chain of extended-spectrum cephalosporins is made by the fact that the Ala substitution not only maintains wild-type catalytic efficiency for penicillins and cephalosporins but also increases the catalytic efficiency for extended-spectrum cephalosporins (Fig. 4). Since the introduction of a methyl group results in an increase in k cat/K m for extended-spectrum drugs, volume occupancy alone by the residue 238 side chain is an important factor, which lends support to the steric conflict model. Decreasedk cat/K m values of the Cys and Val mutants for cephalosporins suggest that the Ala side chain volume is an upper limit in providing an increase in catalytic efficiency without the introduction of an additional hydrogen bond interaction, such as with Ser, Thr, or Asn (Fig. 4). The fact that the hydrogen bonding residues provide increases in catalytic efficiency relative to the Cys and Val residues for all the antibiotics tested suggests that the hydrogen bond interaction is not specific to the antibiotic structure but rather causes a change in the active site configuration. A model to explain these results is that steric conflict of the residue 238 side chain effects the displacement of the omega loop, as proposed by Saves et al. (4Saves I. Burlet-Schiltz O. Maveyraud L. Samama J.-P. Prome J.-C. Masson J.-M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11660-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), but that an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the residue 238 side chain and an omega loop residue is required to stabilize the omega loop in a new location that allows for significant levels of hydrolysis of extended-spectrum cephalosporins. A possible candidate for the new hydrogen partner of Ser238hydroxyl group is the main chain CO group of Asn170 of the omega loop because of its close proximity to residue 238 (23Maveyraud L. Saves I. Burlet-Schiltz O. Swaren P. Masson J.-M. Delaire M. Mourey L. Prome J.-C. Samama J.-P. J. Biol.

Genet. 1993; 16: 364-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). The G238S mutant has been shown to be destabilized relative to the wild-type TEM-1 enzyme (25Raquet X. Vanhove M. Lamotte-Brasseur J. Goussard S. Courvalin P. Frere J.-M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 23: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and the lessened stability could be due to the repositioning of the omega loop as a result of a new hydrogen bond between Ser 238 and Asn170. Omega loop mutations that provide bacteria increased ceftazidime resistance are thought to do so by destabilizing the loop to allow the larger, bulkier ceftazidime antibiotic greater access to the active site (26Palzkill T. Le Q.-Q. Venkatachalam K.V. LaRocco M. Ocera H. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 12: 217-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 27Petrosino J.F. Palzkill T. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). While the Ser substitution would not release omega loop constraints, its larger side chain could be positioned toward Asn170 as a result of hydrogen bond formation with this residue and thus displace this region of the loop and perturb the position of the deacylation residue Glu166. This would account for the decreases in k cat values seen for the penicillins and cephalosporins (Table III). In addition, acylation has been shown to be the rate-limiting step for cefotaxime hydrolysis of both the wild-type TEM-1 and G238S enzymes (4Saves I. Burlet-Schiltz O. Maveyraud L. Samama J.-P. Prome J.-C. Masson J.-M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11660-11667Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), which means that the K mvalue approximates the disassociation value, K s. Comparison of the K m values of the residue 238 mutants for cefotaxime show that the hydrogen-bonding residues provide the best affinity (Table III). Therefore, the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the residue 238 side chain and the Asn170 main chain CO group may act to tether the omega loop in a new position that allows the extended-spectrum antibiotics greater access to the active site cavity and consequently improved catalytic efficiency by the enzyme. In summary, the G238S substitution displays an incredible degree of versatility such that it expands the hydrolytic spectrum of the TEM enzyme to include extended-spectrum antibiotics with little cost to its original hydrolytic activity. The manner in which the G238S substitution acts appears to be through an active site cavity expansion by hydrogen bond interaction with the omega loop. As such, distinguishing the mode of action for the change in the active site conformation may aid in the design of new β-lactam antibiotics or inhibitors or of new combinations of existing drugs.

The expression of nuclear genes in response to cellular and environmental cues is largely regulated by trans-acting factors and their cognate cis-elements. In plants, auxin hormones (e.g., indole-3-acetic acid) promote growth and affect a number of cellular processes. Auxins are believed to mediate at least some of their effect by enhancing the expression of specific genes through target cis-elements (1Guilfoyle T. Hagen G. Li Y. Ulmasov T. Liu Z. Strabala T.

The prototype for one class of auxin-responsive element is activation sequence-1(as-1),1 which was first identified by Lam et al. (3Lam E. Benfey P. Gilmartin P. Fang R.-X. Chua N.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7890-7894Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar) in the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35 S promoter. Homologs of as-1(e.g., ocs and nos), moreover, occur in the promoters of plant-transforming T-DNA genes of agrobacteria (4Bouchez D. Tokuhisa J. Llewellyn D. Dennis E. Ellis J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4197-4204Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 5An G. Costa M. Ha S.-B. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 225-233PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kim Y. Buckley K. Costa M. An G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Apart from regulating these genes in plants, a broader role foras-1 elements has been suggested by their functional presence in plant glutathione S-transferase genes (7Takahashi Y. Niwa Y. Machida Y. Nagata T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8013-8016Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 8Droog F. Spek A. van der Kooy A. de Ruyter A. Hoge H. Libbenga K. Hooykaas P. van der Zaal B.

For example, auxin-responsive expression of at least one member of the tobacco GST gene family, GNT35, is mediated byas-1 (8Droog F. Spek A. van der Kooy A. de Ruyter A. Hoge H. Libbenga K. Hooykaas P. van der Zaal B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 413-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Xiang C. Miao Z.-H. Lam E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Unlike other auxin-responsive elements,as-1 requires physiologically high (i.e.micromolar) concentrations of auxins to activate transcription, suggesting that this response may involve chemical stress. This view is further supported by the observation that biologically inactive analogs of auxins are also strong inducers of as-1-dependent activity.Multiple TGA factors that bind selectively to as-1 and related motifs have been cloned from several plant species, and some or all of these factors are likely to mediate as-1-dependent transcription. Based on their amino acid homology, at least three subclasses of TGA factors occur in plants, with multiple members in each class. Heterodimerization between these factors may generate new combinations with potentially distinct functional properties (10Miao Z.-H. Lam E. Plant J. 1995; 7: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Posttranscriptional regulation may also determine the contribution of each factor to transcription (11Lam E. Lam Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3778-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To date, the only TGA factor that is known to activate transcription is TGA1a of tobacco (12Yamazaki K. Katagiri F. Imaseki H. Chua N.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7035-7039Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although originally suggested to be a plant homologue of CREB, TGA1a lacks several distinguishing features of this animal bZIP transcription factor (13Katagiri F. Lam E. Chua N.-H. Nature. 1989; 340: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 14Gonzalez G. Montminy M. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar).Although little is known about how and where TGA1a functions in plants, its evolutionary conservation implies an important regulatory role in gene expression. To test this view,trans-dominant inhibitors of TGA1a and of its homologue PG13 have been developed and expressed in plants (10Miao Z.-H. Lam E. Plant J. 1995; 7: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 15Rieping M. Fritz M. Prat S. Gatz C. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1087-1098PubMed Google Scholar). These inhibitors are believed to act by forming inactive “heterodimers” with their endogenous counterparts, thus markedly reducing their availability and activity. Although the PG13 and TGA1a inhibitors decreasedas-1 binding activity, they had little or no effect on either plant growth or development. One explanation for these findings is that the residual as-1 binding activity that survives inhibition is sufficient for normal functions, or that as-1acts in conjunction with other cis-elements in most cellular promoters. Recent efforts to completely disrupt the functions of individual TGA factors by homologous recombination may provide alternative approaches for investigating in plantacontributions by these factors (16Miao Z.-H. Lam E. Plant J. 1995; 7: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).Work described here is part of an ongoing effort to elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) by which as-1-dependent transcription is regulated in response to environmental cues. Toward this goal, we chose to study the functional properties of TGA1a as it is highly conserved in plants, suggesting an important role in as-1-dependent transcription. In addition, TGA1a is a member of a large group of bZIP transcription factors, the activity of which in many cases is governed by cellular and environmental cues (17Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar, 18Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 19Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). To investigate functional properties of this tobacco factor, we employed a homologous transient transfection assay with protoplasts, an approach that has been previously used to characterize as-1-dependent transcription (20Ulmasov T. Hagen G. Guilfoyle T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). By co-transfection and gain-of-function assays, we show here thattrans-activation by TGA1a is stimulated by auxins and their analogs via chemical stress.DISCUSSIONIn plants, as-1 and related elements have been shown to confer transcription in response to such diverse cues as auxins, salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, heavy metals, wounding, and xenobiotic stress. Little is currently known about the individual contributions of as-1 binding TGA factors to these transcriptional responses. Of these factors, only TGA1a has been shown to activate plant transcription in vivo (28Neuhaus G. Neuhaus-Url G. Katagiri F. Seipel K. Chua N.-H. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 827-834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results here extend these findings by demonstrating that transiently expressed TGA1a can activate as-1-dependent transcription in response to auxin.As in plants, auxin induces a change in the activity of TGA factors of BY-2 protoplasts to enhance transcription from a truncated −90 (to +4 bp) 35 S promoter that contains a single as-1 element centered at −72 bp (3Lam E. Benfey P. Gilmartin P. Fang R.-X. Chua N.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7890-7894Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Moreover, as-1 is the primary determinant of this truncated promoters activity in tobacco root and suspension culture cells (9Xiang C. Miao Z.-H. Lam E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 32Benfey P. Ren L. Chua N.-H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1677-1684Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). In tobacco leaves (27Liu X. Lam E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 668-675Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and roots (data not shown), as-1 confers transcription from the −90 promoter in response to exogenous auxin. In BY-2 protoplasts, basal and auxin-responsive transcription from −90-CAT requires as-1, as evidenced by the fact that a mutant version of this promoter (−76-CAT) that lacks the upstream TGAC motif of this element was inactive (Fig. 2).Having shown that the −90-CAT reporter gene was selectively activated by auxin, we next examined whether TGA1a might potentiate the activity of this promoter. Although transiently expressed TGA1a enhanced basal and auxin-responsive transcription through as-1, it had a more pronounced effect on the latter activity. The ability of TGA1a to differentially affect −90-CAT activity was explored by a number of ways. First, reporters that lack as-1 (e.g., −76-CAT and CHS-CAT) were unresponsive to transiently expressed TGA1a, thus demonstrating that the affect of TGA1a on −90-CAT activity is through as-1. Results here with CHS-CAT also show that a G-box element that shares homology in its core motif toas-1, but binds poorly to TGA1a in vitro (13Katagiri F. Lam E. Chua N.-H. Nature. 1989; 340: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar,33Schindler U. Beckmann H. Cashmore A. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 1309-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), is unresponsive to this factor.We also explored the possibility that TGA1a might be sequestered in the cytoplasm and subsequently mobilized to the nucleus in response to auxin. This type of regulation is observed with the stimulus-coupled nuclear import of NF-κB and STAT transcription factors in animal cells (17Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar). By immunofluorescent staining, we observed that (epitope-tagged) TGA1a is predominantly localized to the nucleus in control and auxin-treated protoplasts. Because no change in the cellular amount of this factor was found in response to auxin, we conclude that TGA1a is constitutively present in the nucleus and that its transcriptional activity is latent in the absence of a stimulus.If binding to as-1 is regulated by auxin, we reasoned that a chimeric fusion protein of TGA1a and the heterologous DNA binding domain of the yeast GAL4 transcription factor might promote constitutive, rather than signal-responsive, transcription. Contrary to this expectation, we found that GAL4-TGA1a conferred both activities. This prompted us to investigate whether as-1-specific binding, and perhaps other bZIP-encoded functions, are required fortrans-activation by this factor. We found that the activity of a mutant form of GAL4-TGA1a that lacks the bZIP domain (i.e. GAL4-TGA1aΔbZIP) was enhanced by auxin, thus demonstrating that bZIP-encoded functions (e.g. as-1-specific binding, dimerization, and nuclear import) in TGA1a are not the primary regulatory target of this stimulus. Removal of the bZIP domain from GAL4-TGA1a was also found to increase its overall basal and auxin-responsive activities. Although the reason for this effect is unknown, we speculate that the presence of multiple and distinct DNA binding domains in GAL4-TGA1a may result in a chimeric factor that is functionally unstable or that binds to plantas-1 elements, thus decreasing its effective concentration on the GAL-CAT reporter. Data from in vivo labeling experiments favor the former possibility, because the accumulation of GAL4-TGA1a is at least one-fourth that of GAL4-TGA1aΔbZIP at effector DNA concentrations that maximize transcription.Trans-acting factors stimulate gene expression by overcoming rate-limiting steps in the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to the promoter. Within these factors, domains that are rich in acidic, glutamine, proline, or isoleucine residues commonly mediatetrans-activation or repression. The NT region of TGA1a contains an acidic-rich region (amino acids 18–66) that promotestrans-activation in vitro (13Katagiri F. Lam E. Chua N.-H. Nature. 1989; 340: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar) and in vivo (28Neuhaus G. Neuhaus-Url G. Katagiri F. Seipel K. Chua N.-H. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 827-834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments here confirm and extended these results by showing that the first 84 residues of the amino terminus of TGA1a, when fused to the DNA binding domain of the heterologous GAL4 protein, confer basal trans-activation. Moreover, the activity of the NT domain is constitutive and unaffected by auxin, in keeping with our findings that the response to auxin is largely mediated by the carboxyl-terminal domain of TGA1a. We were surprised to find that at saturating amounts of each factor, the basal activity of GAL4-TGA1a-NT is markedly higher than that of GAL4-TGA1aΔbZIP (Fig. 3). This difference suggests that CT residues 143–373, which flank the bZIP domain, might inhibit the basal activity of the NT region. We speculate that auxin somehow relieves this repression, thus maximizingtrans-activation. This notion is also consistent with results here showing that maximal activation by GAL4-TGA1aΔbZIP and GAL4-TGA1a-NT are quite similar in the presence of auxin. In regard to the potential regulatory role of the CT domain on NT activity, we note that trans-activation by an animal bZIP factor termed ATF-2 is regulated through intramolecular interactions (34Li X-Y Green M. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar).Evidence here indicates that the carboxyl-terminal region of TGA1a may have multiple roles in transcription. First, acidic and glutamine residues make up over one-third of a 50-amino acid region within the CT domain (Fig. 1), thus implying the presence of a second activation domain in TGA1a. Consistent with this view, we found that the CT domain of TGA1a alone can confer basal and auxin-responsive transcription through the GAL4 binding domain, albeit at lower levels than those seen with TGA1aΔbZIP. Further mutagenesis and gain-of-function assays may help to identify specific residues in the CT domain that contribute to these individual activities.How might auxin affect the trans-activation potential of the CT domain? Prior studies have identified a “dimer stabilization domain” (amino acids 178–373) within the CT of TGA1a. Although this domain enhances the ability of TGA1a to dimerize and bindas-1, it is not essential for either of these activities (35Katagiri F. Seipel K. Chua N.-H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4809-4816Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We suggest that this domain may reversibly bind to an additional factor that mediates transcription, a situation that is analogous to that observed with other bZIP factors (36Chrivia J. Kwok R. Lamb N. Hagiwara M. Montminy M. Goodman R Nature. 1993; 365: 855-859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1758) Google Scholar, 37Arias J. Alberts A. Brindle P. Claret F. Smeal T. Karin M. Feramisco J. Montminy M. Nature. 1994; 370: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Experiments here indicate that under basal conditions this mediator may bind the CT domain of TGA1a to repress trans-activation through the NT domain. This inhibition is apparently relieved by auxin. We are further exploring this notion that a regulatory protein differentially associates with TGA1a in response to auxin.Diverse plant hormones such as auxins, SA, and MJ, in addition to a number of their biologically inactive analogs, stimulate transcription through as-1 type elements (2Abel S. Theologis A. Plant Physiol. 1996; 111: 9-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 20Ulmasov T. Hagen G. Guilfoyle T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). We found that 2,3-D, a biologically inactive analog of the auxin 2,4-D, stimulatedas-1-dependent gene expression and thetrans-activation potential of TGA1a. Lack of correspondence between the biological activity of auxins or their analogs and their ability to induce transcription has been interpreted as evidence of a response to general chemical stress (20Ulmasov T. Hagen G. Guilfoyle T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). To further explore the nature of the auxin pathway involved, we examined whether mitogenic or toxic properties of 2,4-D mediate its affect onas-1-dependent transcription. As transcription was only induced by concentrations of 2,4-D that inhibited cell-growth, we suggest that this response involves an inhibitory chemical stress pathway. Although benzyl isothiocyanate, dimethyl fumarate, and hydroquinone induce the transcription of animal genes through chemical stress (38Prestera T. Zhang Y. Spencer S. Wilczak C. Talalay P. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1993; 33: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar), we found that these compounds failed to stimulateas-1 -dependent transcription in BY-2 protoplasts over a range of concentrations (data not shown). Based on these observations, we suggest that transcriptional responses studied here evidence a high degree of selectivity for the type of chemical inducer.A potential biological role for as-1-type elements has been suggested by their presence in the promoters of genes that encode for GST isoenzymes of plants (8Droog F. Spek A. van der Kooy A. de Ruyter A. Hoge H. Libbenga K. Hooykaas P. van der Zaal B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 413-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Xiang C. Miao Z.-H. Lam E.

Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 173-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar, 43Hayes J. Pulford D. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1995; 30: 445-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (3228) Google Scholar), and through their GSH-dependent peroxidase activity, they may protect plant cells from reactive hydroperoxides produced as a consequence of oxidative stress and defense responses (44Mehdy M. Plant Physiol. 1994; 105: 467-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, a number of plant GSTs also bind to auxin (45Bilang J. Macdonald H. King P. Sturm A. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 29-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 46Zettl R. Schell J. Palme K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Animal and plant GST genes are regulated by xenobiotic and hormone cues through nearly identical cis-elements (41van der Zaal B. Droog F. Pieterse F. Hooykaas P. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 48Friling S. Bergelson S. Daniel V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 668-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), thus raising the possibility that transcription factors that control the expression of GST genes may be evolutionarily conserved. The expression of nuclear genes in response to cellular and environmental cues is largely regulated by trans-acting factors and their cognate cis-elements. In plants, auxin hormones (e.g., indole-3-acetic acid) promote growth and affect a number of cellular processes. Auxins are believed to mediate at least some of their effect by enhancing the expression of specific genes through target cis-elements (1Guilfoyle T. Hagen G. Li Y. Ulmasov T. Liu Z. Strabala T.

Homologs of as-1(e.g., ocs and nos), moreover, occur in the promoters of plant-transforming T-DNA genes of agrobacteria (4Bouchez D. Tokuhisa J. Llewellyn D. Dennis E. Ellis J. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 4197-4204Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 5An G. Costa M. Ha S.-B. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 225-233PubMed Google Scholar, 6Kim Y. Buckley K. Costa M. An G. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 24: 105-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Apart from regulating these genes in plants, a broader role foras-1 elements has been suggested by their functional presence in plant glutathione S-transferase genes (7Takahashi Y. Niwa Y. Machida Y. Nagata T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8013-8016Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 8Droog F. Spek A. van der Kooy A. de Ruyter A. Hoge H. Libbenga K. Hooykaas P. van der Zaal B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 413-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Xiang C. Miao Z.-H. Lam E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For example, auxin-responsive expression of at least one member of the tobacco GST gene family, GNT35, is mediated byas-1 (8Droog F. Spek A. van der Kooy A. de Ruyter A. Hoge H. Libbenga K. Hooykaas P. van der Zaal B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 29: 413-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Xiang C. Miao Z.-H. Lam E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 32: 415-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Unlike other auxin-responsive elements,as-1 requires physiologically high (i.e.micromolar) concentrations of auxins to activate transcription, suggesting that this response may involve chemical stress. This view is further supported by the observation that biologically inactive analogs of auxins are also strong inducers of as-1-dependent activity. Multiple TGA factors that bind selectively to as-1 and related motifs have been cloned from several plant species, and some or all of these factors are likely to mediate as-1-dependent transcription. Based on their amino acid homology, at least three subclasses of TGA factors occur in plants, with multiple members in each class. Heterodimerization between these factors may generate new combinations with potentially distinct functional properties (10Miao Z.-H. Lam E. Plant J. 1995; 7: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Posttranscriptional regulation may also determine the contribution of each factor to transcription (11Lam E. Lam Y. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 3778-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To date, the only TGA factor that is known to activate transcription is TGA1a of tobacco (12Yamazaki K. Katagiri F. Imaseki H. Chua N.-H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7035-7039Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although originally suggested to be a plant homologue of CREB, TGA1a lacks several distinguishing features of this animal bZIP transcription factor (13Katagiri F. Lam E. Chua N.-H. Nature. 1989; 340: 727-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 14Gonzalez G. Montminy M. Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). Although little is known about how and where TGA1a functions in plants, its evolutionary conservation implies an important regulatory role in gene expression. To test this view,trans-dominant inhibitors of TGA1a and of its homologue PG13 have been developed and expressed in plants (10Miao Z.-H. Lam E. Plant J. 1995; 7: 887-896Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 15Rieping M. Fritz M. Prat S. Gatz C. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1087-1098PubMed Google Scholar). These inhibitors are believed to act by forming inactive “heterodimers” with their endogenous counterparts, thus markedly reducing their availability and activity. Although the PG13 and TGA1a inhibitors decreasedas-1 binding activity, they had little or no effect on either plant growth or development. One explanation for these findings is that the residual as-1 binding activity that survives inhibition is sufficient for normal functions, or that as-1acts in conjunction with other cis-elements in most cellular promoters. Recent efforts to completely disrupt the functions of individual TGA factors by homologous recombination may provide alternative approaches for investigating in plantacontributions by these factors (16Miao Z.-H. Lam E. Plant J. 1995; 7: 359-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Work described here is part of an ongoing effort to elucidate the molecular mechanism(s) by which as-1-dependent transcription is regulated in response to environmental cues. Toward this goal, we chose to study the functional properties of TGA1a as it is highly conserved in plants, suggesting an important role in as-1-dependent transcription. In addition, TGA1a is a member of a large group of bZIP transcription factors, the activity of which in many cases is governed by cellular and environmental cues (17Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1992; 70: 375-387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1116) Google Scholar, 18Karin M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 415-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 19Hill C.S. Treisman R. Cell. 1995; 80: 199-211Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). To investigate functional properties of this tobacco factor, we employed a homologous transient transfection assay with protoplasts, an approach that has been previously used to characterize as-1-dependent transcription (20Ulmasov T. Hagen G. Guilfoyle T. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 26: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). By co-transfection and gain-of-function assays, we show here thattrans-activation by TGA1a is stimulated by auxins and their analogs via chemical stress. DISCUSSIONIn plants, as-1 and related elements have been shown to confer transcription in response to such diverse cues as auxins, salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, heavy metals, wounding, and xenobiotic stress. Little is currently known about the individual contributions of as-1 binding TGA factors to these transcriptional responses. Of these factors, only TGA1a has been shown to activate plant transcription in vivo (28Neuhaus G. Neuhaus-Url G. Katagiri F. Seipel K. Chua N.-H. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 827-834Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Results here extend these findings by demonstrating that transiently expressed TGA1a can activate as-1-dependent transcription in response to auxin.As in plants, auxin induces a change in the activity of TGA factors of BY-2 protoplasts to enhance transcription from a truncated −90 (to +4 bp) 35 S promoter that contains a single as-1 element centered at −72 bp (3Lam E.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)1 of Gram-negative bacteria is composed of lipid A (the hydrophobic membrane anchor), the core region (a non-repeating oligosaccharide), and O-antigen (a distal repeating oligosaccharide) (1Raetz C.R.H.

Inner core mutants often grow more slowly than wild type cells, are hypersensitive to certain antibiotics and display a compromised barrier to hydrophobic compounds (2Raetz C.R.H. Neidhardt F.C.

In nitrogen-fixing Gram-negative bacteria, like the Rhizobiaceae, the core region may influence plant host specificity and may function in signaling pathways leading to the formation of root nodules within the host plant (11Denarie J.

For instance, in Rhizobium leguminosarum, core mutants are able to recognize their plant hosts and form nodules, but these nodules either do not fix nitrogen or do so at greatly reduced rates (14Cava J.R.

There is remarkable diversity of LPS core structures in different species of Gram-negative bacteria. The structure of theEscherichia coli K-12 core region (Fig. 1) is one of the best characterized (2Raetz C.R.H. Neidhardt F.C. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. I. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1996: 1035-1063Google Scholar). Nearly all of the genes required for the biosynthesis of the E. coli core have been identified (2Raetz C.R.H.

However, because the inner E. coli core contains the unusual sugar,l-glycero-d-manno-heptose, the activated nucleotide form of which is not fully characterized, the reactions catalyzed by the enzymes of E. coli core biosynthesis have not been studied in depth (2Raetz C.R.H.

The core structure of R. leguminosarum LPS, as partially displayed in Fig. 1, has been proposed by Carlson and co-workers (20Bhat U.R. Krishnaiah B.S. Carlson R.W. Carbohydr. Res. 1991; 220: 219-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 21Carlson R.W. Reuhs B. Chen T.-B. Bhat U.R. Noel K.D. J. Biol.

The enzymology of core assembly in R. leguminosarum is more amenable to study than in E. coli, given that all the relevant sugar nucleotides are available. In accordance with Carlson's structure, we have been able to identify three novel glycosyltransferases unique to extracts of R. leguminosarum that incorporate mannose (23Brozek K.A. Kadrmas J.L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32112-32118Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), galactose (23Brozek K.A. Kadrmas J.L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

We now describe the three structural genes of R. leguminosarum that encode these glycosyltransferases. Two of the genes, lpcA and lpcB, adjacent to each other on the chromosome, were reported previously (24Allaway D. Jeyaretnam B. Carlson R.W. Poole P.S. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6403-6406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Poole P.S. Schofield N.A. Reid C.J. Drew E.M. Walshaw D.L. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 2797-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), based on mutants with truncated core LPS structures. lpcA was partially sequenced and was proposed to encode the galactosyltransferase because of its homology to other sugar transferases and chemical characterization of LPS isolated from anlpcA::Tn5 insertion mutant (24Allaway D. Jeyaretnam B. Carlson R.W. Poole P.S. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6403-6406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Poole P.S. Schofield N.A. Reid C.J. Drew E.M. Walshaw D.L.

Res. 1992; 231: 261-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar).lpcB was sequenced entirely, and although it showed no homology to any known gene, it was proposed to encode the distal Kdo-transferase based upon the absence of the distal Kdo in the LPS core isolated from an lpcB transposon insertion mutant (24Allaway D. Jeyaretnam B. Carlson R.W. Poole P.S. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6403-6406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We now demonstrate by means of our enzyme assays that lpcAdoes indeed encode the galactosyltransferase and that lpcBencodes the distal Kdo-transferase. In addition, we report a new gene, designated lpcC, encoding the mannosyltransferase, and describe a mutant lacking mannosyltransferase activity. lpcCis located several kb downstream of lpcA and lpcBon the chromosome (Fig. 3). All threeRhizobium genes have been overexpressed using an E. coli T7 promoter-driven system. The recombinant enzymes are catalytically active. The availability of the lpc genes should facilitate the re-engineering of LPS core structures in bothE. coli and Rhizobium. The biological significance of core structural diversity in pathogenesis and symbiosis might be revealed using this approach.Figure 3Order of genes in the lpc-dctregion of the chromosome of R. leguminosarum.The known open reading frames and the directions of transcription are indicated for the chromosomal DNA insert (derived from strain 8002) in cosmid pIJ1848 (25Poole P.S.

BLR(DE3)pLysS/pET23a, BLR(DE3)pLysS/pJK5, BLR(DE3)pLysS/pJK6, and BLR(DE3)pLysS/pJK7 were grown from a single colony in 1 liter of LB medium (10 g of tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract, 10 g of NaCl per liter) (27Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C until the A 600 reached approximately 0.5. The culture was split into two equal portions, and one portion was induced with 100 μg/ml isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Both cultures were incubated with shaking at 225 rpm for an additional 3 h at 37 °C, and the A 600 was recorded. Cells were harvested in the cold (0–4 °C) by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 15 min. For each liter of late log phase culture (A 600 = 1), cell pellets were resuspended in 10 ml of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. The cells were broken by passage through a French pressure cell at 18,000 p.s.i., yielding a protein concentration of approximately 10 mg/ml. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 6,000 × g for 15 min. Washed membranes were prepared by a series of two ultracentrifugations at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended in a minimal volume (1–2 ml) of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5. The protein concentrations of the extracts, membranes and cytosol were determined by the bicinchoninic acid assay (28Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H.

The [4′-32P]lipid IVA was generated from [γ-32P]ATP and the tetra-acylated disaccharide 1-phosphate precursor, using the E. coli 4′-kinase from membranes of strain BLR(DE3)pLysS/pJK2 (29Garrett T.A.

The products were purified by preparative thin layer chromatography and stored at −20 °C as an aqueous dispersion (30Belunis C.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1989; 264: 6956-6966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Prior to each use, these substrates were subjected to ultrasonic irradiation in a water bath for 60 s. For mannosyltransferase reactions, unless indicated, the standard reaction mixtures (10–40 μl) contained 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 μmKdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA at 80,000 cpm/nmol, and 1.0 mm GDP-mannose. The enzyme source, added last to initiate the reaction, was generally 0.3 mg/ml washedRhizobium membranes. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 60 min, unless specified. Galactosyltransferase reactions were identical but also included 1.0 mm UDP-galactose in addition to the above components. Distal Kdo-transferase assays contained all the galactosyltransferase reaction components plus 2 mm Kdo, 5 mm CTP, 10 mmMgCl2, and 1.8 milliunits of partially purified CMP-Kdo synthase per 10 μl. CMP-Kdo is generated in situ because of its short half-life (minutes) (30Belunis C.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9988-9997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When assaying for the R. leguminosarum enzymes expressed in the E. coli T7 system, slightly different conditions were used. The mannosyltransferase assay was the same as above except that 0.2 mg/ml washed E. coli BLR(DE3)pLysS/pJK6 membranes were used as the enzyme source. To assay the E. coligalactosyltransferase construct (pJK7), mannosyl-Kdo2-IVA was first generated in a standard 60-min mannosyltransferase reaction utilizing 0.3 mg/ml washedRhizobium meliloti 1021/pIJ1848 (Table I) membranes. Residual R. meliloti 1021/pIJ1848 activity was then destroyed by a 20-min incubation at 65 °C. To this reaction mixture, 1.0 mm UDP-galactose and 0.2 mg/ml E. coliBLR(DE3)pLysS/pJK7 washed membranes were added. Reactions were then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. To assay the E. colidistal Kdo-transferase construct (pJK5), galactosyl-mannosyl-Kdo2-IVA was first generated in a standard 60-min galactosyltransferase reaction utilizing 0.3 mg/ml washed R. meliloti 1021/pIJ1848 membranes. Residual R. meliloti 1021/pIJ1848 activity was then destroyed by a 20-min incubation at 65 °C. To this reaction mixture, 2 mm Kdo, 5 mm CTP, 10 mmMgCl2, 1.8 milliunits of CMP-Kdo synthase, and 0.2 mg/mlE. coli BLR(DE3)pLysS/pJK5 washed membranes were added. Reactions were then incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. Reactions were stopped by spotting 5-μl portions of the reaction mixtures onto a silica gel 60 thin layer chromatography plate. After drying in a stream of cold air, plates were developed in the solvent chloroform/pyridine/88% formic acid/water (30:70:16:10, v/v). The amount of product formed was calculated from the percent conversion of radioactive substrate (of known specific radioactivity) to product, quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. Plasmids were prepared using the Qiagen Spin Prep kit. Restriction endonucleases, shrimp alkaline phosphatase, and T4 DNA ligase were all used according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA fragments were isolated from agarose gels using a Qiaex II gel extraction kit. All other techniques involving manipulation of nucleic acids were from Ausubelet al. (32Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989Google Scholar). Cells were made competent for transformation by resuspension in 100 mm CaCl2, as described (32Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989Google Scholar). Plasmids were introduced into strains of Rhizobium via triparental mating (33Glazebrook J. Walker G.C. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 398-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). E. coli strain 803 (34Wood W.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 16: 118-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar) or DH5α (35Hanahan D. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 166: 557-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (8216) Google Scholar) served as the plasmid donor. E. coli strain MT616 (36Finan T.M. Kunkel B. DeVos G.F. Signer E.R. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 167: 66-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) provided the transfer functions. The appropriate strain of Rhizobium (see below) served as the recipient. Sequencing of a portion of lpcA and its homology to certain LPS core glycosyltransferases has previously been reported (24Allaway D. Jeyaretnam B. Carlson R.W. Poole P.S. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 6403-6406Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (accession no.X94963). Full-length lpcA was required to demonstrate the enzymatic activity of LpcA. The 5′ terminus of the gene was determined by cycle sequencing using custom-made Cy5-labeled primers to pRU68 (25Poole P.S. Schofield N.A. Reid C.J. Drew E.M. Walshaw D.L. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 2797-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), Thermo Sequenase, and the ALFexpress automated DNA sequencer. A restriction map of the 4.4-kb EcoRI fragment containing dctA has been constructed (37Ronson C.W. Astwood P.M. Downie J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 903-909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the nucleotide sequence of dctAdetermined (EMBL accession no. Z11529). The region downstream of dctA on the 4.4-kb fragment was sequenced on both strands using a combination of sub-cloned fragments and custom primers, and an Applied Biosystems model 373A autosequencer. This sequence can be found under accession no. AF050103. To construct strain RSKnH, a kanamycin-resistance cassette was inserted into the HindIII site within the lpcC open reading frame. The kanamycin cassette was cloned from pUC4KIXX (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as aSmaI fragment into pIC20H (38Marsh J.L. Erfle M. Wykes E.J. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 32: 481-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). It was then excised as aHindIII fragment and cloned into HindIII-digested pPN120 to give pRS5. pPN120 is a pLAFR1 derivative carrying the 4.4-kbEcoRI fragment that includes part of dctB, dctA, and 2000 base pairs downstream of dctA(37Ronson C.W. Astwood P.M. Downie J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 903-909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pRS5 was transferred by triparental mating to R. leguminosarum strain 3855, and recombination of the kanamycin resistance gene into the genome was forced by introduction of the incompatible plasmid pPH1. Southern hybridizations of EcoRI and KpnI digests of genomic DNA probed with pPN108 (37Ronson C.W. Astwood P.M. Downie J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 903-909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used to confirm that the kanamycin cassette had recombined into the expected location. Pisum sativum seeds were surface-sterilized by washing with absolute alcohol, followed by soaking for 1 h in 12% sodium hypochlorite, followed by five washes with sterile water. The seeds were allowed to imbibe and then transferred to 550-ml jars containing a sterile moistened mix of fine vermiculite and pumice at a ratio of 3:1. The seeds were inoculated with 1 ml of a suspension of Rhizobium cells washed from a fresh GRDM plate (37Ronson C.W. Astwood P.M. Downie J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 903-909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The pots were watered with nitrogen-free nutrient solution (37Ronson C.W. Astwood P.M. Downie J.A. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 903-909Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and grown under controlled environmental conditions in a growth room at 20 °C day/15 °C night on a 12-h day/night cycle. The plant roots were examined for nodules after 3–6 weeks. The cloning of PCR generated lpcA, lpcB, and lpcC DNA into a vector under T7 promoter control is outlined in Fig. 4 (39Rosenberg A.H.

The forward primers were synthesized with a clamp region, an NdeI restriction site, and a match to the coding strand starting at the translation initiation site. The reverse primer was synthesized with a clamp region, aBamHI restriction site, and a match to the anticoding strand that included the stop site. The PCR was performed using Pfupolymerase, as specified by the manufacturer. The plasmid pIJ1848 (25Poole P.S. Schofield N.A. Reid C.J. Drew E.M. Walshaw D.L. Microbiology. 1994; 140: 2797-2809Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) was used as the template. Amplification was carried out in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 100 ng of template, 20 mmTris-HCl, pH 8.8, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 2 mm MgSO4, 200 μm of each of the dNTPs, 125 ng of each primer, and 1.2 units of Pfu polymerase.

Both maize kinase sequences contain the five domains with conserved signature residues typical of procaryotic two-component histidine kinases. Sequence comparisons identified six other highly conserved motifs that are proposed to be specific to pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases. In addition, specific Trp and Cys residues are also invariant in these sequences. The maize cDNAs are 1332 (PDK1) and 1602 (PDK2) nucleotides in length, encoding polypeptides with calculated molecular masses of 38,867 and 41,327 Da that share 77% amino acid identity. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis with oligonucleotide-specific primers revealed a differential expression pattern for the two isoforms. PDK1 and PDK2 were expressed in Escherichia coli with N-terminal His6 tags to facilitate purification. The recombinant proteins migrated at 44 and 48 kDa, respectively, during SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

The mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (mtPDC)1 catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, yielding acetyl-CoA and NADH to support the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (1Reed L.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 1974; 7: 40-56Crossref Scopus (654) Google Scholar, 2Patel M.S. Roche T.E. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 3224-3233Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). In addition to the mtPDC, plants have a second PDC localized in the plastid stroma, where it provides acetyl-CoA for fatty acid biosynthesis (3Camp P.J. Randall D.D. Plant Physiol. 1985; 77: 571-577Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Williams M. Randall D.D. Plant Physiol. 1979; 64: 1099-1103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The plastid and mitochondrial PDCs have considerably different properties reflecting their unique roles in metabolism (reviewed in Ref. 5Luethy M.H. Miernyk J.A. David N.R. Randall D.D. Alpha- Keto Acid Dehydrogenase Complexes. Birkhausen, Boston1996: 71-72Google Scholar). The most striking difference is regulation by reversible phosphorylation. The mtPDC, unlike the plastid counterpart, has an associated PDH kinase and phospho-PDH phosphatase, which catalyze reversible phosphorylation of the α subunit of the PDH component (reviewed in Ref. 6Randall D.D. Miernyk J.A. David N.R. Gemel J. Luethy M.H. Protein Phosphorylation in Plants. Clarendon Press, Oxford1996: 87-103Google Scholar). Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK, EC2.7.1.99) catalyzes inactivation of PDC while the phospho-PDH phosphatase reactivates mtPDC. Consequently, the phosphorylation status of mtPDC is determined by the activities of these opposing enzymes, and physiological effectors of plant PDKs would thus regulate the phosphorylation status of mtPDC in vivo (6Randall D.D. Miernyk J.A. David N.R. Gemel J. Luethy M.H. Protein Phosphorylation in Plants. Clarendon Press, Oxford1996: 87-103Google Scholar). In most plants, leaf mtPDC is phosphorylated in the light by a photosynthesis-photorespiration-sensitive mechanism (7Budde R.J.A. Randall D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 8Gemel J. Randall D.D. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 908-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For C3 plants, this is most likely due to photorespiratory glycine metabolism that occurs in the leaf mitochondria during photosynthesis. Glycine oxidation generates large amounts of NADH to support mitochondrial ATP production, as well as NH4+, which stimulates PDH kinase (9Schuller K.A. Gemel J. Randall D.D. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 139-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Consequently, mtPDC is negatively regulated as glycine oxidation increases. To further understand reversible phosphorylation of mtPDC in plants and its role in the control of Krebs cycle activity, we have undertaken a molecular analysis of maize PDK. The molecular cloning of the first PDK cDNA from rat (10Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26602-26606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) showed the deduced primary amino acid sequence lacked typical eucaryotic Ser/Thr kinase domains, but had the domains diagnostic of procaryotic two-component histidine kinases (reviewed in Ref. 11Harris R.A. Popov K.M. Zhao Y. Kedishvili N.Y. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1995; 35: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Procaryotic histidine kinases autophosphorylate on a His followed by phosphotransfer to Asp (or Glu) of their response regulator protein to transduce cellular signals (reviewed in Ref. 12Stock J.B. Ninfa A.J. Stock A.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1989; 53: 450-490Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on similarities to histidine kinases, PDKs could also utilize His for phosphotransfer, but unlike histidine kinases PDKs phosphorylate Ser residues. There is as yet no evidence for His autophosphorylation for the PDKs. This new class of eucaryotic protein kinases also includes the branched chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase kinase (BCKDH kinase; Ref. 13Popov K.M. Zhao Y. Shimomura Y. Kuntz M.J. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13127-13130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which regulates a related mitochondrial α-keto acid complex involved in branched chain amino acid degradation. Although the two kinases are related, they are specific for their respective complex (14Popov K.M. Shimomura Y. Harris R.A. Protein Exp. Purif. 1991; 2: 278-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The domains responsible for substrate recognition, complex association, and catalysis by PDKs have not yet been identified. More information on the structure-function relationships of this unique class of eucaryotic protein kinases might become apparent from comparison of primary amino acid sequence data from divergent organisms. Based on similarities to the rat PDK, putative PDKs have also been identified from humans (15Gudi R. Bowker-Kinley M.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Popov K.M. J. Biol.

The maize cDNAs were identified from the Pioneer Hi-Bred International (Johnston, IA) maize expressed sequence tag data base by screening with the entire rat PDK amino acid sequence (10Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26602-26606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Multiple cDNAs with varying degrees of homology were identified using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST; Ref. 19Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (70762) Google Scholar). Two unique maize cDNAs that were homologous to the C-terminal portion of the rat PDK and of sufficient length were identified for subsequent sequencing. The two cDNAs were sequenced on both strands using AmpliTaq Gold with fluorescent dye-deoxynucleotides according to manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, CA). Reaction products were analyzed on an Applied Biosystems, Inc. model 373 automated sequencer, at the University of Missouri DNA Core Facility. Nested deletions were generated using the “Erase-A-Base” procedure according to manufacturer's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). Mitochondria were isolated from etiolated maize (B73, Illinois Seed Foundation, Urbana, IL) shoots according to procedures described previously (20Thelen J.J. Miernyk J.A. Randall D.D. Plant Physiol. 1997; 116: 1443-1450Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Isolated mitochondria were resuspended in 30 mm TES-KOH, pH 7.5, 2 mm DTT, then homogenized on ice with a Polytron (Brinkmann, Westbury, NY). The homogenate was centrifuged in a TL100 centrifuge at 100,000 × g using a TL100.3 rotor for 15 min. Supernatants, termed the 100K enzyme, were concentrated with an Amicon ultrafiltration membrane (XM300, 300-kDa cut-off). This protein was layered onto a 10–50% linear glycerol gradient containing 50 mm TES-KOH, pH 7.5, and 2 mm DTT, then centrifuged in an SW28 rotor for 16 h at 25,000 rpm. The PDC activity peak at approximately 30% glycerol had only 5% (± 4%, n = 7) PDK activity and was termed kinase-depleted PDC. PDC activity assays were performed as described previously (20Thelen J.J. Miernyk J.A. Randall D.D. Plant Physiol. 1997; 116: 1443-1450Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Approximately 60 μg of maize total RNA isolated from various organs was treated with 5 units of RNase-free DNase (Boehringer Mannheim) for 2 h at 37 °C in 10 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 units of RNasin RNase inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI). The RNA was then extracted with phenol, precipitated with ethanol, and resuspended in nuclease-free water. The RNA was quantitated by absorbance at 260 nm and diluted to 10 ng/μl for use in RT-PCR. Each RT-PCR reaction contained the following RNase-free reagents: 1.5 mm magnesium sulfate, 0.2 mm dNTPs, 1.5 pmol/μl oligonucleotides, 0.1 unit/μl avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, 0.1 unit/μl Tfl DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), 1× l avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase buffer, 2.5 ng/μl DNase-free RNA. Reverse transcription proceeded for 45 min at 48 °C. The PCR cycling was as follows: 2 min at 94 °C (one cycle); 30 s at 94 °C, 1 min at 60 °C; 2 min at 68 °C (40 cycles); 7 min at 68 °C (one cycle). The oligonucleotides used for PDK1 are DDR189 (5′-tggtgatccgggttttacat-3′; sense oligonucleotide) and DDR194 (5′-tcattactcgagctgcagctatcattacggcaagggttcctccga-3′; antisense oligonucleotide), which amplify a 437-bp region between 663 and 1098 bp. The oligonucleotides used for PDK2 are DDR185 (5′-ggacatcagatacttccctg-3′; sense oligonucleotide) and DDR186 (5′-tccggtttagggtcatgcaa-3′; antisense oligonucleotide), which amplify a 268-bp region between 993 and 1259 bp. Primers DDR 193 (5′-gtcacgcccggggaattcaccATGGCGTCGGAGCCG-GTGGCGCGG) and DDR 194 (5′-tcattactcgagctgcagctatcaTTACGGCAAGGGTTCCTCCGA) were used to amplify PDK1 and PDK2 open reading frames (amino acids 1–347, PDK1; 1–364, PDK2) corresponding to the region between 56 and 1098 (PDK1) and 78 and 1172 (PDK2) base pairs. To ensure translation termination, the two remaining nonsense codons were introduced into DDR194 (underlined). Restriction sites were introduced into each primer at the 5′ end (lowercase letters) to facilitate subcloning of the PCR fragment in the proper reading frame. TheEcoRI (DDR 193) and XhoI (DDR 194) sites were used to subclone the PCR products into pET28a expression vector (Novagen, Madison, WI), which encodes six His residues, followed by an 11-amino acid T7 epitope tag upstream of the multiple cloning site. TheEcoRI and PstI (DDR194) sites were used to subclone into pMAL-cRI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA), which encodes for a 385-amino acid maltose-binding polypeptide upstream of the multiple cloning site. Thermal cycling reactions (50 μl total volume) contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, 5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), 2 ng of plasmid cDNA template, 5% dimethyl sulfoxide, and 20 pmol of each primer. Cycling conditions were 94 °C for 5 min, initial denaturation, followed by 30 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 50 °C, 2 min at 72 °C with 6-s extensions for the last step of each cycle. A single colony of recombinant Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) was inoculated into 2 ml of LB medium supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml), and incubated with shaking at 37 °C overnight. The cells were transferred to 100 ml of LB plus kanamycin in a baffled Erlenmeyer flask and shaken at 37 °C until theA 600 reached 0.4 (2–4 h). The target gene was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.1 mm and continuing shaking at 37 °C for another 4–8 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 × g for 20 min) and recombinant protein purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid chelate chromatography under denaturing conditions according to Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA) protocols. Dialyzed recombinant protein (50 μg) was emulsified with 0.5 ml of Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma) and injected into New Zealand White rabbits. The rabbits were boosted once with 50 μg of recombinant protein plus incomplete adjuvant. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed as described by Thelen et al.(20Thelen J.J. Miernyk J.A. Randall D.D. Plant Physiol. 1997; 116: 1443-1450Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation experiments were carried out with 100K enzyme plus protein A-purified IgG for 3 h on ice. Protein A-conjugated agarose was then added and incubated for another 3 h. Immunoprecipitates were removed by centrifugation, and the supernatants assayed for MgATP-dependent inactivation of PDC. The MBP-PDK chimera was expressed similarly to PDK1 in BL21 E. coli host cells with ampicillin selection. The target gene was induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 6 h at 37 °C. The cells were harvested and resuspended in ice-cold MBP wash buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.2 m NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm EDTA) plus 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine, and 1% (v/v) Triton X-100. The resuspended cells were disrupted by ultrasonic treatment using three 45-s pulses at 50 watts, while cooling on ice between pulses. The suspension was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was applied to an amylose column (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) that had been equilibrated with MBP wash buffer. The column was subsequently washed with 50 volumes of MBP wash buffer. Bound MBP fusion protein was eluted with three volumes of MBP wash buffer plus 1% (w/v) maltose. The purified fusion protein was dialyzed for 16 h in 20 mmTES-KOH, pH 7.4, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mmbenzamidine. After dialysis, the fusion protein was concentrated with an Amicon ultrafiltration membrane (PM30, 30-kDa cut-off) and stored at −80 °C in 0.1-ml aliquots. Several conventional approaches were unsuccessful in obtaining cDNA clones encoding plant PDKs. However, two cDNAs encoding putative PDKs were identified from a maize expressed sequence tag data base (Pioneer Hi-Bred International), based on sequence similarity to the rat PDK. The two cDNAs are 1332 and 1602 bp in length with open reading frames starting with ATG codons at bases 55 and 78 and in-frame stop codons at 1096 and 1170 bases, respectively. Although no stop codons upstream of the initiating methionine were found, the translation start codon could be predicted when the deduced amino acid sequences of the two maize PDKs were aligned. For clarity, we will term the 1332- and 1602-bp cDNAs and the proteins they encode as PDK1 and PDK2, respectively. These cDNA clones encode polypeptides of 347 and 364 amino acids with calculated molecular weights of 38,867 and 41,327, respectively, and share 78% overall amino acid identity. A major difference between these isoforms is the 16 fewer amino acids (168–183 of PDK2) within PDK1. The function of this domain and reason for its absence in PDK1 are uncertain, although it may impart unique properties to this isoform. The first 30 residues of both PDK1 and PDK2 (Fig. 1) are rich in Ala, Arg, and Val residues and can form amphipathic α helices. These are characteristic of mitochondrial targeting sequences (22Moore A.L. Wood C.K. Watts F.Z. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 45: 545-575Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Another feature is the low abundance of acidic residues, although approximately 40% of plant mitochondrial targeting sequences contain such residues (23Whelan J. Glaser E. Plant Mol. Biol. 1997; 33: 771-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) including the maize PDKs, which contain three in the first 30 amino acids. Processing generally occurs at sites with Arg residues 3 and 10, 11 amino acids upstream (22Moore A.L. Wood C.K. Watts F.Z. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 45: 545-575Crossref Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 24von Heijne G. Steppuhn J. Herrmann R.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 180: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (910) Google Scholar). Arg8 and Arg16at the −11 and −3 position may signal processing after Gly18. Alternatively, Arg21 and Arg28 (conserved Lys28 for PDK2) are spaced properly and could also signal processing after Met30. The deduced amino acid sequences of the maize PDKs are approximately 37% identical to mammalian PDKs (for rat, see Refs. 10Popov K.M. Kedishvili N.Y. Zhao Y. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Harris R.A. J.

The homologous regions span the entire polypeptide, although the C-terminal half has the highest similarity as illustrated by comparison to the rat PDK (Fig. 1). The relatedness of PDKs and procaryotic histidine kinases is confined to five subdomains (11Harris R.A. Popov K.M. Zhao Y. Kedishvili N.Y. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1995; 35: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), defined by essential residues also conserved in the maize PDKs (Fig. 2). Within subdomain I is a conserved His117 (numbering according to PDK2), that in the procaryotic His kinases is the autophosphorylation site, involved in phosphotransfer. In mammalian PDKs, e.g. rat, two motifs on either side of this invariant His, (R146NR148)rat and (P154TMAQGV160)rat, are conserved, but not conserved in the BCKDH kinase and are conservatively substituted to (R114 XR116)maize and (P122(T/A)(M/I)AXGV128)maizein the maize PDKs. In the mammalian PDKs, the motif (K280NAMRAT286)rat containing an essential Asn281 within subdomain II of the rat PDK is proposed to be the hinge region allowing the ATP binding domains to interact with the phosphotransfer domain (11Harris R.A. Popov K.M. Zhao Y. Kedishvili N.Y. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1995; 35: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In maize, the canonical Asn is present along with the two basic residues (K242NXXRAX 248)maize. Subdomain III of the rat PDK (S315DRGGG320)rat, containing the signature DXGXG is also present in both maize PDKs. Subdomain IV contains the essential Tyr279 residue within the conserved motif (F293 XYXYSTA300)maize. Subdomain V is defined by a glycine-rich motif (A317GXGXG322)maize, which like subdomain III has essential Gly residues that may be involved in ATP binding (11Harris R.A. Popov K.M. Zhao Y. Kedishvili N.Y. Shimomura Y. Crabb D.W. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1995; 35: 147-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In addition to the five conserved subdomains characteristic of the procaryotic two-component histidine kinases, the maize PDKs have six other subdomains that are also well conserved in mammalian PDKs and semi-conserved in the BCKDH kinase (Fig. 2). The N-terminal motif (F78LXXELP(V/I)RXA88)ratis conserved in all PDKs and the BCKDH kinase, suggesting that it has a common role in all keto acid dehydrogenase kinases. The most conserved domain throughout the entire family of polypeptides is not one of the five His kinase subdomains but rather a 15-amino acid motif between subdomains I and II with the consensus (F151LDRFYMSRIXIRML165)maize. Interestingly, this motif is located immediately upstream of the 16 “missing” amino acids in PDK1. This motif is less conserved in the BCKDH kinase FLDXXXXSRXXIRML, suggesting a PDK-specific function. Another highly conserved motif is immediately downstream of subdomain V with the consensus (P324ISRLYAXYFXGDL337)maize, corresponding to PXSRXYAXYXXGXL in the BCKDH kinase. Four residues downstream from this motif is the consensus (S341 XEGYGTDA349)maizefor PDKs and SXXGXGTDX for the BCKDH kinase. Overall, these four domains in the maize PDKs are more similar to the mammalian PDKs than to the BCKDH kinase, further suggesting the maize proteins are PDKs. An interesting feature of the maize PDK primary sequence is the paucity of Trp and Cys residues. Trp83 is conserved in all PDKs but not the BCKDH kinase and is part of the consensus (V80 XXWYXXS87)maize, possibly involved in PDK-specific function (Fig. 2). Cys206, found in the conserved motif (A202RXXCXXY209)maizeand conserved in all PDKs and the BCKDH kinase, might be involved in catalysis or inter- but probably not intrathiol disulfide exchange since PDK1 does not contain a second Cys. Dendrogram analysis with putative and characterized PDKs reveals at least three groups of related PDKs (Fig. 3). The Ascaris suum and hypothetical Caenorhabditis elegans proteins form a group that may also contain the putative Drosophila melanogasterPDK. The characterized mammalian PDKs form a closely linked group more related to other animal than plant PDKs. The BCKDH kinase is divergent from all PDKs, and the procaryotic His kinase PhoM (26Amemura M. Makino K. Shinagawa H. Nakata A. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6300-6307Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) outlies the entire group. The high degree of nucleotide similarity between PDK1 and PDK2 prevented the specific detection of transcripts when using restriction enzyme-digested DNA fragments as probes by Northern analysis. However, 20-base oligonucleotides, designed to regions of low homology, enabled specific detection of transcripts by RT-PCR. The oligonucleotide pair for PDK1 did not amplify PDK2 cDNA, nor did PDK2 primers amplify PDK1 cDNA, under the same conditions RT-PCR was carried out (data not shown). After DNase treatment, the RNA was devoid of DNA, as determined by PCR amplification prior to reverse transcription. Although RT-PCR is, at best, semiquantitative, it enables detection of low abundance transcripts with high specificity, which is why it was used. The overall pattern of expression for PDK1 transcript is clearly different from the transcript for PDK2 (Fig. 4). Whereas PDK1 appears to be somewhat constitutive in its expression pattern, PDK2 is up-regulated in leaves. The higher expression of PDK2 in green leaves might enable acute response to mitochondrial ATP concentration during photosynthesis, a model consistent with the photosynthetic-induced inhibition of mtPDC activity observed in maize and other plants (7Budde R.J.A. Randall D.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 673-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 8Gemel J. Randall D.D. Plant Physiol. 1992; 100: 908-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recombinant His6-tagged PDK1 expressed in E. coli was greater than 95% insoluble under all conditions tested; therefore, it was purified under denaturing conditions. Recombinant His6-tagged PDK1 and PDK2 polypeptides were typically 95% pure after affinity chromatography and migrated at 44 ± 2 (S.D.,n = 7) and 48 ± 3 (S.D., n = 3) kDa, respectively (Fig. 5). The recombinant proteins were slightly larger than the predicted mass of 38,867 and 41,327 Da, because the His6 and T7 epitope tags plus multiple cloning site add 37 amino acids (approximately 3.5 kDa) to the N terminus. However, even when the N-terminal tags are accounted for, the recombinant proteins migrate 3–4 kDa larger upon SDS-PAGE than predicted. This anomaly was also observed with protein translated in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate (data not shown). In this case, no additional amino acids were present at the N terminus, yet the apparent size was 3–4 kDa larger than predicted. Size discrepancies have also been observed with another subunit to this complex, the dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase, which migrates 10–15 kDa slower during SDS-PAGE. Recombinant PDK1 was used as an antigen to raise rabbit polyclonal antibodies. Antibodies to PDK1 recognized both PDK recombinant proteins by immunoblot analysis (data not shown). Purified IgG immunoprecipitated 75% of PDK activity from a 100K maize mitochondrial extract while the preimmune IgG had no effect (Fig. 6 A). The non-precipitated kinase activity might be due to an immunogenically distinct kinase or incomplete precipitation. PDK1 antibodies did not recognize any polypeptides from a total maize mitochondrial fraction (Fig. 6 B, lane 1). However, upon enrichment for PDC activity by rate-zonal sedimentation a 43 ± 2 (S.D.,n = 5) kDa polypeptide was decorated with PDK antibodies (Fig. 6 B, lanes 2 and 3). This polypeptide was not detected after glycerol gradient fractionation of PDC, in agreement with the loss of kinase activity in this fraction (Fig. 6 B, lane 4). The smaller size of the mitochondrial matrix protein, compared with recombinant PDKs, is due to the absence of the His6 and T7 epitope tags and processing of the mitochondrial targeting peptide.Figure 6A, immunoremoval of PDK activity from a maize mitochondrial matrix fraction. Purified anti-rPDK1 IgGs were incubated with a 100K enzyme fraction and protein A-agarose. The 100K supernatant was incubated with 10 mm KF (to inhibit phospho-PDH phosphatase) and assayed for MgATP-dependent inactivation of PDC with 2 mm MgATP for 50 min at 25 °C. Minus ATP controls for each time point were included. B, immunoblot of PDC purification fractions probed with anti-PDK1-His6 antibodies. Purified mitochondria from etiolated maize shoots were homogenized and centrifuged 100,000 ×g for 15 min, supernatant was termed “100K enzyme.” The 100K enzyme was centrifuged at 400,000 ×g for 6 h and the resuspended pellet termed “400K enzyme.” The 400K enzyme was layered onto a linear 10–50% glycerol gradient and centrifuged at 25,000 rpm for 16 h in a SW28 rotor. PDC activity fractions were pooled and termed “glyc gradient.” Approximately 25 μg of protein was loaded in each lane of the immunoblot.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The solubility problem associated with the pET expression system was overcome by expressing PDK as a C-terminal fusion to MBP. Purified recombinant MBP-PDK2 (90 ± 3 (S.D., n = 5) kDa, Fig. 5) inactivated kinase-depleted maize mitochondrial PDC in an ATP-dependent manner (Fig. 7) while purified MBP had no effect (data not shown). For ATP-dependent inactivation, the ratio of PDK to PDC was approximately 1:30 (μg), taking into consideration the purity of the PDC preparation (20Thelen J.J. Miernyk J.A. Randall D.D. Plant Physiol. 1997; 116: 1443-1450Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and the non-catalytic 46-kDa MBP partner protein. The rate of ATP-dependent inactivation was slower with recombinant MBP-PDK2 than with native PDK (20Thelen J.J. Miernyk J.A. Randall D.D. Plant Physiol. 1997; 116: 1443-1450Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar), presumably due to the bulk of the MBP protein partner. The MBP-PDK2-mediated MgATP-dependent inactivation was coincident with32P incorporation from [γ-32P]ATP into a 43-kDa protein (Fig. 6, inset), the precise molecular mass for maize E1α as determined using monoclonal antibodies to maize E1α (20Thelen J.J. Miernyk J.A. Randall D.D. Plant Physiol. 1997; 116: 1443-1450Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The data presented here support our conclusion that maize PDK1 and PDK2 are PDK and not BCKDH kinase isoforms. In summary, the evidence for this is as follows: 1) the primary amino acid sequences are more similar to mammalian PDKs than to the BCKDH kinase, 2) anti-PDK antibodies immunoprecipitate PDK activity from a maize mitochondrial extract, and 3) recombinant PDK inactivates kinase-depleted maize mitochondrial PDC with concomitant incorporation of phosphate on to the 43-kDa E1α subunit.

This was achieved by Edman amino acid sequencing of the isolated tandem repeat after selective removal of non-C3-substituted, peptide-linked GalNAc residues by periodate oxidation and subsequent trimming of the remaining oligosaccharides to peptide-linked GalNAc residues by mild trifluoromethanesulfonic acid/anisole treatment. The sequencing reveals 61% (range, 12–95%) of the peptide α-N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues to be substituted by core 1 chains, a value in agreement with the carbon-13 NMR analysis of the native mucin. Residues with the lowest C3 substitution were typically clustered in regions of sequence with the highest densities of (glycosylated) serine or threonine. This suggests that the porcine β3-Gal, core 1, transferase is sensitive to peptide sequence and/or neighboring core GalNAc glycosylation in vivo, in keeping with earlier in vitro enzymatic glycosylation studies (Granovsky, M., Blielfeldt, T., Peters, S., Paulsen, H., Meldal, M., Brockhausen, J., and Brockhausen, I. (1994)Eur. J. Biochem. 221, 1039–1046). These results demonstrate that the O-glycan structures in mucin domains are not necessarily uniformly distributed along the polypeptide core and that their lengths can be modulated by peptide sequence. The data further suggest that hydroxyamino acid spacing may contribute to the regulation of glycan length, thereby, providing a mechanism for maintaining an optimally expanded, protease resistant, mucin conformation.

Protein O-glycosylation is a common post-translational modification of a wide range of secreted and membrane-associated proteins. Many of these glycoproteins contain highlyO-glycosylated, so called mucin-like, domains that are important to their function (1Gerken T.A. Owens C.L. Pasumarthy M. Townsend R.R. Hotchkiss A.T.

These domains contain high numbers (>30%) of Ser and Thr, which are extensivelyO-glycosylated by oligosaccharide side chains attached via α-N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc).1 These domains are typically 50% or more carbohydrate by weight and commonly contain tandemly repeated amino acid sequences. Little is known of the structural and dynamic effects of multiple O-glycosylation, except that these regions are resistant to proteases and possess extended conformations (4Jentoft N. Trends Biol.

Studies on the ovine and porcine submaxillary gland mucins have shown that their O-glycan side chains (which make up ∼60–70% of their masses) are responsible for their expanded solution structure and resistance to proteases, and hence are a key component governing the protection rendering properties of mucins (4Jentoft N.

The absence of specificO-glycan structural information is principally due to the lack of suitable analytical methods applicable to the characterization of such heavily O-glycosylated domains. Major practical difficulties arise from the resistance of these domains to proteolytic cleavage and their inherent oligosaccharide structural heterogeneity, thereby making it difficult to obtain suitable glycopeptides for structural analysis. Although Edman sequencing of glycoproteins containing intact O-linked glycans have been reported, the inherent oligosaccharide heterogeneity presents significant problems when attempting to quantitate a glycosylation pattern of a glycoprotein (19Gooley A.A. Williams K.L. Nature. 1997; 385: 557-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20Pisano A. Jardine D.R. Packer N.H. Redmond J.W. Williams K.L. Gooley A.A. Farnsworth V. Carson W. Cartier P.K. Townsend R.R. Hotchkiss A.T. Techniques in Glycobiology. Marcel Dekker, New York1997: 299-320Google Scholar). Mass spectrometric approaches have also recently been applied to the characterization of short mucin glycopeptides (21Muller S. Goletz S. Packer N. Gooley A. Lawson AM. Hanisch F-G J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24780-24793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 22Goletz S. Leuck M. Franke P. Karsten U. Rapid Comm.

Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 881-8898Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The analysis by mass spectrometry is extremely complex and typically requires oligosaccharide trimming to the peptide GalNAc residue, via chemical or enzymatic approaches (21Muller S. Goletz S. Packer N. Gooley A. Lawson AM. Hanisch F-G J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24780-24793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 38Iwase H. Tanaka A. Biki Y. Kokubo T. Ishii-Karakasa Kobayashi Y. Hotta K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 393-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). In addition, mass spectrometry approaches are not easily made quantitative and are unreliable for the quantitative determination of glycosylation patterns.Recently we reported the nearly quantitative determination of the specific α-GalNAc-Ser/Thr core O-glycosylation pattern of the 31 Ser/Thr residues in the 81-residue glycosylated tandem repeat of porcine submaxillary gland mucin (PSM) (24Gerken T.A. Owens C.L Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9709-9719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Our approach involved the quantitative trimming of the mucin oligosaccharide side chains to the core GalNAc residue by treatment with trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMSA)/anisole at 0 °C followed by trypsinolysis and the isolation of an ensemble of tandem repeat glycopeptides. Edman amino acid sequencing was then used to obtain the glycosylation pattern by the quantitation of specific glycosylated and nonglycosylated amino acid derivatives. Practical advantages to this approach are: 1) the reduction of oligosaccharide side chain heterogeneity by the mild TFMSA/anisole treatment; 2) the increased susceptibility the partially deglycosylated (trimmed) mucin to proteases, thereby allowing the isolation of tandem repeat monomers; and 3) the ability to readily identify and quantify monosaccharide Ser/Thr-GalNAc derivatives by standard Edman amino acid sequencing protocols. Applicability of this approach has been further demonstrated by the recent determination of the core O-glycosylation pattern of the 20-residue tandem repeat of the Muc1 isolated from human milk (21Muller S. Goletz S. Packer N. Gooley A. Lawson AM. Hanisch F-G J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24780-24793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar).A chief drawback of the use of the above approach is the contaminant loss of oligosaccharide side chain structural information, which indeed is the chief reason that the approach works so effectively. We now report on a scheme, using this basic approach, that permits the quantitation of the core 1 ([R]-β-Gal(1–3)-α-GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr) oligosaccharide structures in a peptide sequence-dependent manner. The ability to monitor the GalNAc C3 OH substitution status relies on the ability to selectively remove non-C3 substituted peptide-linked GalNAc residues after periodate oxidation, while leaving C3-substituted GalNAc residues intact (25Gerken T.A. Gupta R. Jentoft N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In this manner only those peptide-linked GalNAc residues substituted at C3 are retained for amino acid sequencing. We have confirmed the selectivity of this procedure by studies on the antifreeze glycoprotein (AFGP) from Antarctic fish, whose side chains are exclusively β-Gal(1–3)-α-GalNAc-O-Thr (26Berman E. Allerhand A. DeVries A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 4407-4410Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). With this modification it is now possible to further characterize theO-glycan structures of mucins and other heavilyO-glycosylated proteins in a sequence-dependent manner. Having such information will permit the characterization of the peptide specificities of the core 1, β3-galactosyltransferase (UDP-galactose:glycoprotein-N-acetylgalactosamine β3-galactosyltransferase) that catalyzes a primary step in O-glycan biosynthesis. Using this approach we have obtained the sequence specific core 1 glycosylation pattern of 30 of the 31 Ser/Thr residues in the PSM tandem repeat. This represents the first sequence-specific determination of an oligosaccharide side chain structure of any highly glycosylated mucin-type glycoprotein. Our results indicate that in vivo the β-Gal(1–3) core 1 transferase is sensitive to peptide sequence and/or neighboring core α-GalNAc glycosylation, findings that corroborate previous in vitro enzymatic studies on glycopeptide substrates (27Brockhausen I Moller G. Merz G. Adermann K. Paulsen H. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10206-10212Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 28Granovsky M. Blielfeldt T. Peters S. Paulsen H. Meldal M. Brockhausen J. Brockhausen I.

Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 33204-33210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The basic molecule is composed of a very large central highlyO-glycosylated domain flanked by small Cys-rich globular domains at both the N and C termini. The glycosylated domain is composed of approximately 100 81-residue tandem repeats with the sequence as given in Fig. 1 A(30Timpte C.S. Eckhardt A.E. Abernethy J.L. Hill R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1081-1087Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each tandem repeat contains 31 Ser/Thr O-glycosylation sites, all of which have been observed to be O-glycosylated, although to different degrees of completion (24Gerken T.A. Owens C.L Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9709-9719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We have previously suggested that the observed differential glycosylation may be partially due to the steric effects of penultimate bulky side chains (24Gerken T.A. Owens C.L Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9709-9719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The oligosaccharide side chain structures described for PSM range from the monosaccharide α-GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr, Tn determinant, to the tetrasaccharide α-GalNAc(1–3) [α-Fuc(1–2)]-β-Gal(1–3)-α-GalNAc-O-Ser/Thr), A blood group determinant (31Carlson D. J. Biol. Chem. 1968; 243: 616-626Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each of these mono- through tetra- saccharides are potentially glycosylated by an α-NeuNGl residue attached to the peptide-linked GalNAc at C6, thus up to eight possible oligosaccharides can be found in PSM. The complete series of possible structures is given in Fig. 1 B. The oligosaccharide side chain composition of native PSM can be readily quantitated by carbon-13 NMR spectroscopy (32Gerken T.A. Jentoft N. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4689-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Studies on several preparations of PSM indicate that 30–40% of the PSM side chains consist of the monosaccharide α-GalNAc, while the di-, tri-, and tetrasaccharides each contribute 0–40% of the remainder of the oligosaccharides, depending on the blood group status of each individual pig (32Gerken T.A. Jentoft N. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4689-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Forty to fifty percent of these oligosaccharides are substituted by NeuNGl, although, the distribution of NeuNGl among the different oligosaccharides is unknown (32Gerken T.A. Jentoft N. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4689-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsAFGP purified from the blood of Dissostichus mawsoni(fractions AFGP 1–5) (33DeVries A.L.

Studies were performed on two pools of A blood group-positive TR-PSM with nearly identical oligosaccharide side chain distributions; see Table IA under “Results.” These pools were also utilized for our earlier studies (24Gerken T.A.

(25Gerken T.A. Gupta R. Jentoft N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). TR-PSM (10 mg/ml) was made 0.1 m HIO4, pH 4.5, and incubated at 4 °C in the dark for 5 h or overnight. Periodate was destroyed by the addition of 0.4 mNa2S2O3, 0.1 m NaI, 0.1m NaHCO3, and the elimination begun by immediately adjusting the pH to 10.5 with 1 m NaOH. After 1 h on ice the solution was dialyzed overnight against ∼2.5 mm sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 10.5. After dialysis the remaining oxidized oligosaccharide side chains were reduced at 0 °C by the addition of 1 m NaBH4 in 1 mNa2HPO4 (1 ml/10 mg of mucin). After 1 h, NaBH4 was destroyed with dilute acetic acid to pH ∼6.5. Best results were obtained when care was taken to keep the oxidized mucin on ice until after the NaBH4 reduction (see “Results”). After exhaustive dialysis the reaction mixture was lyophilized and fractionated on Sephacryl S200. This oxidized and eliminated mucin will be called EOTR-PSM.To reduce peptide core degradation (see “Results”) that apparently occurs during the overnight elevated pH elimination procedure, an alternate procedure was developed. In this procedure, after the destruction of the periodate, the mucin was immediately reduced by NaBH4 in phosphate buffer as described above. This modified mucin will be called ROTR-PSM.Partial Deglycosylation by Mild TFMSA/Anisole and Isolation of PSM Tandem Repeat GlycopeptidesSephacryl S200-fractionated, oxidized mucin was partially deglycosylated by TFMSA/anisole (3:1) at 0 °C for 4–5 h (25Gerken T.A. Gupta R. Jentoft N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and trypsinized following the procedures of Gerken et al. (24Gerken T.A. Owens C.L Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9709-9719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Tandem repeat glycopeptides were isolated on Sephacryl S200 chromatography and when necessary further purified by reverse phase HPLC. After this procedure TTEOTR-PSM and TTROTR-PSM tandem repeats are obtained.Biotinylation of the Tryptic Tandem Repeat GlycopeptidePurified tandem repeat glycopeptide (TTEOTR-PSM or TTROTR-PSM) (4 mg in 1.5 ml of 66 mmNaH2CO3 containing 66% Me2SO, pH 8.2) was N-terminal biotinylated by the addition of a ∼40-fold molar excess of N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin (Pierce) (6.5 mg in 0.2 ml of Me2SO). After 6 h, a second aliquot of N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin in Me2SO was added, and the mixture was incubated at ambient temperature overnight. The modified tandem repeat glycopeptide was separated from low molecular weight reagents on Sephracryl S200 chromatography yielding 3 mg of N-terminal biotinylated tandem repeat after lyophilization. The biotinylated tandem repeat will be called BTTEOTR-PSM or BTTROTR-PSM.Isolation of the Large C-terminal Glu-C Tandem Repeat GlycopeptideSephacryl S200-purified biotinylated tryptic tandem repeat glycopeptide (∼3 mg/ml) in 25 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8, was digested with ∼0.4 mg of protease Glu-C overnight at 25 °C. A second addition of Glu-C, and an additional 6–8-h incubation was performed to ensure full digestion. The digestion mixture was applied to a prewashed 1-ml bed volume immobilized avidin column (Pierce) and washed with 5 ml of 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 7.8. The pass through and wash, which contain the nonbiotinylated C-terminal Glu-C glycopeptides, were collected, pooled, and lyophilized. After Sephacryl S200 chromatography the large C-terminal glycopeptide fraction (called ABTTEOTR-PSM or ABTTROTR-PSM) gave 1.5 mg of glycoprotein after lyophilization. Both glycopeptide were characterized on reverse phase HPLC.Antifreeze Glycoprotein ModificationsAFGP (12-mg aliquots) were periodate-oxidized and eliminated or oxidized and immediately reduced as described for PSM above. Partial deglycosylation of the native and oxidized AFGP by mild TFMSA/anisole was also performed as described previously for PSM (24Gerken T.A. Owens C.L Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9709-9719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 25Gerken T.A. Gupta R. Jentoft N. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 639-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). After mild TFMSA/anisole treatment, each yielded ∼8 mg of deglycosylated AFGP, which were characterized by carbon-13 NMR spectroscopy.NMR AnalysisCarbon-13 NMR spectra of native and modified mucins were obtained at 67.9 MHz with a Bruker AC-270 spectrometer using acquisition conditions previously described (32Gerken T.A. Jentoft N. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4689-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Oligosaccharide side chain distribution was determined from integrations of the anomeric carbon region of the carbon-13 NMR spectrum of native mucin (32Gerken T.A. Jentoft N. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4689-4699Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). GalNAc removal after oxidation-elimination was obtained by integration of the GalNAc C1 and C5 carbons and the α-carbon resonance of Gly. Percent glycosylation was obtained by normalizing the integrals to the Gly, Ser, and Thr content of PSM reported by the amino acid analysis of Gupta and Jentoft (35Gupta R. Jentoft N. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 6114-6121Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The Ser/Thr α-carbon resonances cannot be readily used for obtaining quantitative deglycosylation data due to overlap with other peptide α-carbon resonances, although changes in their intensities can by used to confirm Ser/Thr deglycosylation.Amino Acid SequencingPulsed liquid phase Edman degradation amino acid sequencing was performed on an Applied Biosystems Procise 494 protein sequencer (Perkin-Elmer, Applied Biosystems Div., Foster City, CA) using the manufacturer's recommended pulse liquid cycles as described previously (24Gerken T.A. Owens C.L Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9709-9719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Amino acid phenylthiohydantion (PTH) derivatives were chromatographed on an ABI 5-μm C18 PTH column using the fast normal I gradient program and monitored by the absorbance at 269 nm. The PTH-Ser/Thr-O-GalNAc elute as two diastereotopic peaks in the chromatogram at relatively unique positions and constant area ratios. Peak areas were measured automatically, and picomoles of PTH derivative were determined after eliminating long term cycle preview and lag for each PTH derivative by a simple base line substraction approach and correcting when necessary for overlapping peaks as described previously (24Gerken T.A. Owens C.L Pasumarthy M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9709-9719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This base line substraction approach permits the quantitation of the extent of glycosylation by eliminating long range base line contributions to the peak area from adjacent cycles. Corrections for the overlap of the second eluting PTH-Thr-O-GalNAc diastereomer with PTH-Thr were made using the previously obtained area ratios for the two PTH-Thr-O-GalNAc diastereomers obtained from fully glycosylated glycopeptides (1Gerken T.A.

The cell cycle describes a collection of highly ordered processes that ultimately result in the duplication of a cell. Cyclin-dependent kinases play an essential role in the regulation and progression of the cell cycle, including DNA duplication and accurate cell division. Cyclin D1·CDK41 plays a major role in the initiation of the cell cycle, the passage through the restriction point (G0), and entry into the S-phase. The only known target of active cyclin D1·CDK4 is the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein (pRb); however, other cyclin-dependent kinases such as cyclin E·CDK2 and cyclin A·CDK2 have also been shown to phosphorylate pRb in the G1-phase and the G1/S transition of the cell cycle. Growth suppression by pRb is closely correlated with its ability to form complexes with a number of proteins (1Wang J.Y. Knudsen E.S. Welch P.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1994; 64: 25-85Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) through different domains of its sequence, but this function is inhibited by phosphorylation of specific serine/threonine pRb residues by cyclin-dependent kinases. Evidence supporting the idea that phosphorylation of pRb is required for G1/S progression comes from studies of p16, an inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6. This protein inhibits the phosphorylation of pRb and arrests only pRb-positive cells in the G1-phase (2Lukas J. Parry D. Aagaard L. Mann D.J. Bartkova J. Strauss M. Peters G. Bartek J. Nature. 1995; 375: 503-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). During the cell cycle, pRb appears hypo-phosphorylated in the early to mid-G1-phase and hyper-phosphorylated during mitosis. Upon phosphorylation, pRb releases and activates a number of proteins such as the E2F family of transcription factors at the G1/S transition phase (3Dynlacht B.D. Flores O. Lees J.A. Harlow E.

As cells enter the cycle from quiescence (G0), one or more D-type cyclins (D1, D2, and D3) are induced and subsequently bind and activate cyclin-dependent kinases as part of the delayed early response to growth factor stimulation (7Sherr C.J. Cell. 1994; 79: 551-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar). This kinase activity, which is manifested near the mid-G1, increases to a maximum during the G1/S transition phase and persists through the first and subsequent cycles as long as mitogenic stimulation continues. Cyclin binding on cyclin-dependent kinase is absolutely required for kinase activity and also contributes to substrate specificity. Cyclin D1 associates predominantly with CDK4 in a complex that is subject to many levels of regulation. It has been suggested (8Stepanova L. Leng X. Parker S.B. Harper J.W. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1491-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar) that an assembly factor could be involved in stabilizing CDK4 or cyclin D1 forms compatible with the holoenzyme activation, although it may not be a part of the active complex. Cyclin D1·CDK4 is both positively and negatively regulated by phosphorylation of activating and inhibitory serine/threonine and tyrosine residues (9Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar). On the other hand, cyclin D1·CDK4 activity can be suppressed by binding to at least two families of small inhibitory proteins such as p16 and p21 (10Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 847-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 11Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 1149-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (3221) Google Scholar) that might even modify their specificity or accessibility to regulators or even to substrates (12Patra D. Dunphy W.G. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1503-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The resulting phosphorylation pattern of pRb by the activated kinase has been studied extensively (13Taya Y. Yasuda H.

Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Also, the substrate specificity and the consensus motif of the enzyme have been the subject of a detailed investigation (5Kitagawa M. Higashi H. Jung H.-K. Suzuki-Takahashi I. Ikeda S. Tamai K. Kato J. Segawa K. Yoshida E. Nishimura S. Taya Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7060-7069Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) where it has been shown that cyclin D1·CDK4 and cyclin A/E-CDK2 have different phosphorylation recognition sites on pRb. Although pRb contains 16 potential CDK-mediated phosphorylation sites (Ser/Thr-Pro motifs), there are good indications that only about 10 of these residues are phosphorylated in vivo (18Zarkowska T. Mittnacht S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12738-12746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 19Connell-Crowley L. Harper J.W. Goodrich D.W. Mol. Biol.

Weinberg R.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 753-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (859) Google Scholar). Different cyclin-CDKs preferentially phosphorylate pRb at distinct sites in vitro, suggesting that these kinases may exert distinct effects during the cell cycle in vivo. The cyclin D1·CDK4-pRb pathway is of considerable interest since its deregulation leads to reduced fidelity of cell cycle events resulting in uncontrolled proliferation and cancer (22Cordon-Cardo C. Am. J. Pathol. 1995; 147: 545-560PubMed Google Scholar, 23Karp J.E. Broder S. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 309-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For example, cyclin D1 amplification or overexpression appears to be a common observation of human malignancies with high frequency, such as head and neck (40%), esophageal (35%), and breast (50%) carcinoma. We anticipate that potent, selective cyclin D1·CDK4 inhibitors may have anti-tumorigenic properties by halting the growth of cancer cells that are pRb+, so we have been interested in developing practical novel in vivo and in vitro strategies to identify such potent compounds. In this report, we describe the purification and extensive characterization of the biochemical and kinetic properties as well as the kinetic mechanism of this very important enzyme. This enzymatic insight in combination with an inhibitor modeling study may eventually identify critical amino acid residues of the enzyme and unique chemical entities of small molecules necessary for tight binding in the enzyme active site. In addition, we have also evaluated kinetically a fusion form of cyclin D1-CDK4, where the two subunits (cyclin D1 and CDK4) are connected with a linker peptide. The two forms of cyclin D1·CDK4, the complex and the fusion, share similar kinetic properties and mechanism, so both forms appear complementarily useful in the cell cycle inhibitor discovery. 2R. N.

Staurosporine was obtained from Lilly. Small peptides (listed in Table V) were synthesized, purified, and characterized at Lilly. One batch of RbING(aa 246–257) was purchased from Multiple Peptide Systems (San Diego, CA); purified murine Rb21 (aa 769–921) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA), and [γ-32P]ATP at 2 Ci/mmol was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Other commercially available reagents are as follows: MES, Hepes, ATP, MgCl2, DTT, EDTA, EGTA, sucrose, and trichloroacetic acid were from Sigma; AEBSF and leupeptin were from Calbiochem; Complete Protease Inhibitor mix was from Boehringer Mannheim; microfiltration plates (phosphocellulose (MAPH) and glass fiber type C (MAFB)) were from Millipore (Bedford, MA); scintillation counting solution MicroScint 40 was from Packard (Packard Instrument Company; Meriden, CT); Poros 50HQ was from PerSeptive Biosystems (Framingham, MA); Macro-Prep Ceramic Hydroxyapatite type I (40 μm) was from Bio-Rad; Sepharose G-25, Mono S, and Mono P were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.

The kinase activity assay for cyclin D1·CDK4 was carried out in a 96-well microtiter plate format measuring radioactivity incorporated in a phosphoacceptor peptide or protein co-substrate. Highly purified enzyme preparations, phosphoacceptor peptides, or Rb21 and [γ-32P]ATP/ATP (as substrates) were used for the determination of the kinetic parameters by a kinase activity assay modified from that described previously (13Taya Y. Yasuda H. Kamijo M. Nakaya K. Nakamura Y. Ohba Y. Nishimura S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 164: 580-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar,25Kitagawa M. Saitoh S. Ogino H. Okabe T.

The peptide substrate was incubated in 20 mmHepes, pH 7.5, in the presence of 14.3 mmMgCl2, various concentrations of ATP and [γ-32P]ATP at a final concentration of 6.077 μCi/μmol in a 65-μl volume at 32 °C for 30 min. The reaction was initiated with the addition of 25 μl enzyme, which was previously diluted (1:5 to 1:40) in a buffer containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 8.0, 0.1 mm DTT, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm AEBSF, 0.01% Triton X-100, and 10% glycerol. The reaction was stopped with 120 μl of 10% phosphoric acid, and the plate was vortexed and 200 μl of solution were transferred in a 96-well plate with a phosphocellulose paper filter (MAPH) and filtered through Millipore filtering apparatus with house vacuum. The plate was washed 3 times with 200 μl of 0.5% phosphoric acid, dried with a paper towel, and then monitored for radioactivity in a liquid scintillation counter (Packard). In addition, Rb21 was used as a phosphoacceptor for cyclin D1·CDK4 complex and fusion. Rb21 is the C-terminal portion of pRb, which spans amino acids 769–921 and could interact extensively with the enzyme and its active site, potentially in a similar fashion as the full-length pRb. When Rb21 was used as the phosphoacceptor protein, the assay was performed in the same way, but the reaction was stopped with 100 μl of 25% trichloroacetic acid, followed by the addition of 25 μl of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The plate was vortexed, 200 μl of solution was transferred to a glass fiber plate (MABP) and counted in the same way as described above. To identify the existence of enzyme-bound intermediates, we performed the same assays in the absence of phosphoacceptor substrate to investigate possible incorporation of γ-32P in the enzyme. One more set of assays was performed in the absence of the enzyme only, as a control which would give an estimate of nonspecific binding of [γ-32P]ATP on the phosphocellulose filter paper. During the purification of cyclin D1·CDK4 complex, the kinase activity of chromatographic fractions was determined by using 428 μm ATP, 3.57 μCi/ml [γ-32P]ATP, and 286 μm RbING. For the calculation of the enzyme-specific activity, the protein concentration was determined by the Bio-Rad microassay method. The generation of recombinant viruses for gene cloning of cyclin D1 and CDK4 was described recently (25Kitagawa M. Saitoh S. Ogino H. Okabe T. Matsumoto H. Okuyama A. Tamai K. Ohba Y. Yasuda H. Nishimura S. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1067-1074PubMed Google Scholar). The viral stocks were used to infect large scale Sf9 cultures at the indicated multiplicity of infection (27Rice J.W. Rankl N.B. Gurganus T.M. Marr C.M. Barna J.B. Walters M.M. Burns D.J. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 1052-1059PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were maintained at 27 °C for 48 h and then harvested by hollow fiber concentration followed by freezing at −80 °C until further use. The purification of cyclin D1·CDK4 was performed at 4 °C. The enzyme appeared to be unstable upon storage at 4 °C, especially when the purity was low, so the purification process was carried out continuously without interruption. Whole cell pellets were suspended (1:10 ratio) in the homogenization buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 320 mm sucrose, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm AEBSF, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and Complete Protease Inhibitor mixture (1 tablet/50 ml of buffer)). The cells were homogenized, using a Gla-Col homogenizer, and centrifuged at 23,700 × g for 45 min. The supernatant was filtered through a 0.22-micron filter and loaded on a Poros Q column (22 × 1 cm) previously equilibrated with buffer A (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmAEBSF, 20 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10% glycerol). The column was washed with 10 column volumes of buffer A, and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient (0–1 m NaCl in buffer A). Active fractions, as analyzed by the kinase assay, were pooled together, and the salt concentration was adjusted to approximately 200 mmwith buffer B (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm AEBSF, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) and loaded onto a 15-ml hydroxyapatite column, previously equilibrated with buffer B. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of buffer B, and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient (0–500 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5). Active fractions were pooled and loaded on a G-25 Sepharose column for a quick exchange with buffer C (25 mmMES, pH 6.0, 5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm AEBSF, and 5% glycerol). The desalted cyclin D1·CDK4 was loaded on a 1-ml Mono S column, previously equilibrated with buffer C, washed with 30 ml of equilibration buffer, and eluted with a linear gradient (0–1m NaCl in buffer C). The active enzyme pool was loaded on a 1-ml Mono P column, previously equilibrated with buffer D (25 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2.5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm AEBSF, and 5% glycerol), and the protein was eluted with a linear gradient (0–1 m NaCl in buffer D). Since freezing and thawing of the purified preparation decreased the specific activity, the purified enzyme was stored in aliquots at −80 °C prior to characterization and kinetic studies; under these conditions, the enzyme remained stable for months. The construction of the cyclin D1-CDK4 fusion protein with N-terminal (His)6-tag and the expression of the protein in baculovirus-infected insect cells were described previously (28Otto, K. A., Kovacevic, S. A., Lemke, S. J., Cocke, K., Beckmann, R. P., and Rao, R. N. (1996) Keystone Symposium on Molecular and Cellular Biology, Silverthorne, CO, Jan. 11–17, 1996, Abstr. 338Google Scholar).2 Whole cell pellets were treated similarly to those described above for the complex enzyme. During the purification the fusion enzyme appeared more stable than the complex enzyme. After cell disruption, the supernatants were dialyzed against the loading buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, with 150 mm NaCl) and passed through a TosoHaas metal-chelating column equilibrated in the same buffer. The fusion protein was eluted with an imidazole gradient. The active fractions were pooled together, dialyzed against buffer A (loading buffer plus 5 mm DTT and 1 mm EDTA), and loaded to a Mono Q column. A linear gradient with buffer B (buffer A plus 1 m NaCl) was used to elute the protein. The last step involved concentration of the fusion protein by Amicon ultrafiltration and further purification by Superdex 200 gel filtration. Amicon Centriprep and Centricons were used to dialyze and concentrate the protein to about 10 mg/ml in buffer A for crystallization experiments (not shown). The enzyme purity was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (4–20% gradient or 10% gel; ISS-Enprotech, Boston, MA). Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250, or proteins were detected by silver staining (Novex, San Diego, CA). The extent of purity was determined by scanning the stained gel with digital Imager (Alpha Innotech Corp., Oceanside, CA). Cyclin D1·CDK4 purification was also followed by Western blot using rabbit antibodies against cyclin D1 and CDK4, respectively (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Secondary antibody was peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA). The gel technique of Whitaker (29Whitaker J.R. Anal. Chem. 1963; 35: 1950-1953Crossref Scopus (909) Google Scholar) was used to estimate the molecular weight of cyclin D1·CDK4. A 25-ml Superdex 200 gel filtration column was equilibrated with several column volumes of 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm DTT, 0.1 mm AEBSF, and 10% glycerol. Individual fractions were assayed for the kinase activity, whereas the absence of separated subunits of cyclin D1 and CDK4 was confirmed by Western blotting using anti-cyclin D1 and anti-CDK4 antibodies. The mass of the enzyme components was determined with liquid chromatography/MS on a PESciex connected on line with a high pressure liquid chromatograph (Applied Biosystems, 140B; Foster City, CA) equipped with a microbore pump and a microbore column C8 (100 × 1 mm, Aquapore RP-300). Electrospray mass spectra were obtained using a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Perkin-Elmer Sciex API III; Thornhill, Ontario, Canada) equipped with a pneumatically assisted electrospray source. Samples were infused in the source of the mass spectrometer at a flow rate of 10 μl/min using a syringe pump. Analyses were performed in the negative ion detection mode. Scans were acquired over a range of 900–2100 units in 0.1-unit intervals for a dwell time of 1 ms per interval. A total of 5–10 scans were accumulated. By using a partially purified enzyme (Mono S eluate; approximately 75% purity), we examined the following variables for improving the enzyme activity and stability: buffer types and concentrations (Hepes, Mes, Tris, and phosphate), ionic strength (KCl), pH, DTT (1–5 mm), metal ions (Ca2+, Zn2+, Ni2+, Mg2+, Mn2+, Fe2+, and Co2+ at 14 mm final concentration), Triton X-100 (up to 0.02%), and organic solvents that were used to dissolve inhibitors (ethanol or Me2SO up to 4% final concentration). The full-length retinoblastoma protein (pRb), the physiological phosphoacceptor substrate of cyclin D1·CDK4, contains 16 potential phosphorylation sites. There is strong evidence (14Lees J.A. Buchkovich K.J. Marshak D.R. Anderson C.W. Harlow E. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 4279-4290Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) that about 10 of them are phosphorylated in vivo. Therefore, using pRb as a substrate, it would be difficult to extract any meaningful conclusion about the phosphorylation process since each one of these phosphorylation sites should be recognized as a unique substrate for the enzyme. On the other hand, the commercial cost for multi-milligram quantity was estimated to be very high; thus, it appeared impractical in acquiring any extensive kinetic data with this protein substrate. Alternatively, we examined the mechanistic question indirectly by performing steady-state kinetics with a simple peptide (RbING) that contains only one phosphorylation site (5Kitagawa M. Higashi H. Jung H.-K. Suzuki-Takahashi I. Ikeda S. Tamai K. Kato J. Segawa K. Yoshida E. Nishimura S. Taya Y. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7060-7069Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar) and by correlating qualitatively these kinetic data with those obtained with a more physiologically relevant phosphoacceptor protein (Rb21). In the former case we ignored the presumably extensive interactions between the enzyme and the substrate and focused on the phosphorylation event under conditions of limited electrostatic interactions. The kinetic data were modeled according to the following Equation 1.1/v0=KmATP/Vmax[ATP]+KmRbING/Vmax[RbING]+Kx/Vmax[RbING][ATP]+1/Vmax(Eq. 1) where [ATP] and [RbING] represent the concentrations of the substrates and K mATP and K mRbING are the Michaelis constants (30Segel, I. H., (1993) Enzyme Kinetics, Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady State Enzyme Kinetics,pp. 505–845, John Wiley & Sons, New YorkGoogle Scholar). Kinetic data were processed by unweighted iterative nonlinear least squares fitting of initial velocities as a function of substrate concentration. The kinetic parameters obtained by fitting the data points to rectangular hyperbolic plots were then used to plot the initial velocity pattern in linear double-reciprocal form as shown in all figures. Kinetic constants were derived from the secondary plots of the best-fit parameters from the primary data patterns. The result was the same when the data were all fitted in the equation describing a bi-substrate enzyme catalysis. Inhibition types were assigned by considering the statistical significance of the difference between intercept and/or slope values of double-reciprocal plots from experiments in the presence and absence of the inhibiting agent. Kinetic parameters were estimated by using the nonlinear least squares statistical analysis software package JMP (SAS; Cary, NC) run on a Power Macintosh personal computer. The graphs were made using a graphics program KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA). In our calculations, we assumed that the purified enzyme was fully active as determined above. For the inhibition experiments with staurosporine, a stock solution of 500 μm staurosporine in Me2SO was made and further diluted with 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, to a stock solution of 200 μm final concentration. This stock solution was adjusted to the desired concentrations for inhibition studies in the range of 200 nm to 1 μm with buffer Me2SO, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, in a ratio 4:6. As there was no three-dimensional structure of human CDK4 available, this was determined by homology modeling (31Greer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3393-3397Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 32Greer J.

The software Homology (from Biosym Technologies, now a part of Molecular Simulations Inc., San Diego, CA) and the program “Modeller” (37Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol.

The program Homology was used to obtain the sequence alignments using the conserved structural regions in the three proteins. The sequence alignment thus obtained was used in Modeller to obtain the final model for CDK4. Staurosporine was modeled using its absolute configuration (38Nobuyuki F. Hiroaki T. Yaeko K. Yumiko T. Yoshihiro H. Yuzuru I. Satoshi O.

We have determined the kinetic mechanism forT. brucei γ-GCS. The kinetics are best described by a rapid equilibrium random ter-reactant mechanism, in which the model derived K d values for the binding ofl-Glu, l-α-aminobutyrate, and ATP to free enzyme are 2.6, 5.1, and 1.4 mm, respectively. However, significant dependences exist between the binding of some of the substrate pairs. The binding of either ATP or l-Glu to the enzyme increases the binding affinity of the other by 18-fold, whereas the binding of l-Glu or l-α-aminobutyrate decreases the binding affinity of the other by 6-fold. Similarly to the mammalian enzyme, cystamine is a time-dependent, irreversible inhibitor of T. brucei γ-GCS. It has been suggested by several studies that cystamine labels an active site Cys residue essential for catalysis. Among the enzymes reported to be inactivated by cystamine, only one Cys residue is invariant (Cys-319 in T. brucei γ-GCS). Mutation of Cys-319 to Ala in T. brucei γ-GCS renders the enzyme insensitive to cystamine inactivation without significantly affecting the enzyme's catalytic efficiency, kinetic mechanism, or substrate affinities.

These studies suggest that cystamine inactivates the enzyme by blocking substrate access to the active site and not by labeling an essential active site residue. γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase wild-type T. brucei γ-GCS Cys-319 to Ala mutant T. brucei γ-GCS l-α-aminobutyrate polymerase chain reaction. The parasitic protozoa Trypanosoma brucei is the causative agent of African sleeping sickness. T. brucei is responsible for significant morbidity and mortality, yet the available anti-trypanosomal drugs are limited in effectiveness by drug resistance, by high toxicity and by their lack of action against late stage disease (1Wang C.C. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 93-127Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Major differences have been found in the utilization of the tripeptide thiol glutathione (GSH) between the parasite and the mammalian host. Mammals rely on GSH for protection against oxidative injury by peroxides or free radicals and for detoxification of xenobiotics (2Meister A. Dolphin D. Avramovic O. Poulson R. Glutathione: Chemical, Biochemical and Medical Aspects. John Wiley and Sons, New York1989: 368-457Google Scholar). Trypanosomes maintain redox balance by synthesizing a conjugate of glutathione and spermidine, termed trypanothione (3Fairlamb A.H. Blackburn P. Chait B.T. Cerami A. Science. 1985; 227: 1485-1487Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). The reduced form of trypanothione is maintained by trypanothione reductase, a homolog of mammalian glutathione reductase (4Fairlamb A.H. Le Quesne S.A. Hide G. Mottram J.C. Coombs G.H. Holmes P.H. Trypanosomiasis and Leishmaniasis. CAB International, 1997: 149-161Google Scholar). The first step in the biosynthesis of glutathione, and thereby trypanothione, is catalyzed by γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS).1 This enzyme catalyzes the ATP-dependent ligation of l-Cys and l-Glu to produce γ-glutamylcysteine. γ-GCS is the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of glutathione in mammalian cells (2Meister A. Dolphin D. Avramovic O. Poulson R. Glutathione: Chemical, Biochemical and Medical Aspects. John Wiley and Sons, New York1989: 368-457Google Scholar) and of trypanothione in the trypanosomatid, Leishmania tarentolae (5Grondin K. Haimeur A. Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3057-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). An enzyme-activated inhibitor of γ-GCS, buthionine sulfoximine, cures mice infected with T. brucei(6Arrick B.A. Griffith O.W. Cerami A. J. Exp. Med. 1981; 153: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), implicating γ-GCS as a potential drug target. The finding that trypanosomes lack catalase (7Mehlotra R.K. Clin. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 22: 295-314Google Scholar), and consequently possess an intracellular hydrogen peroxide concentration 100 times that found in mammalian cells, may account for the selective toxicity of glutathione depletion on the trypanosome (8Meshnick S.R. Chang K.P. Cerami A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1977; 26: 1923-1928Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A number of other studies also demonstrate that oxidative stress has detrimental effects on T. brucei viability. Deletion of even a single allele of trypanothione reductase in Leishmania donovani decreased survival in macrophages (9Dumas C. Ouellette M. Tovar J. Cunningham M.L. Fairlamb A.H. Tamar S. Olivier M. Papadopoulou B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2590-2598Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Lysis of the cattle variant of T. brucei by haptoglobin in human serum is likely to be mediated by H2O2 (10Smith A.B. Esko J.D. Hajduk S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 284-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). γ-GCS amplification in L. tarentolae cell lines resistant to antimonials and arsenicals was an essential factor in the resistant phenotype (5Grondin K. Haimeur A. Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3057-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Studies on mammalian γ-GCS suggest that the reaction proceeds through the generation of a γ-glutamylphosphate intermediate (11Orlowski M. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 7095-7105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This result is supported by the finding that buthionine sulfoximine is phosphorylated by γ-GCS in the presence of ATP to form a tight binding transition state analog (12Griffith O.W. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 1205-1210Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Griffith O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13704-13712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies to delineate the kinetic mechanism of mammalian γ-GCS have provided conflicting results; the reaction has been proposed to proceed through an ordered ter-ter mechanism (11Orlowski M. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 7095-7105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), an ordered A (ATP) random BC mechanism (14Yip B. Rudolph F.B. J. Biol.

Chem. 1978; 253: 2615-2633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and various ping-pong mechanisms (17Van Buskirk G.E. Gander J.E. Rathbun W.B. Eur. J.

J. 1973; 133: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Little is known about the active site or catalytically relevant residues of γ-GCS from any species. Mammalian, worm, and T. brucei γ-GCS have been demonstrated to be inactivated by cystamine (16Lebo R.V. Kredich N.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 2615-2633Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Huang C.S. Moore W.R. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Parasitol. 1995; 72: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Inactivation is proposed to proceed through formation of a disulfide bond to a Cys residue in the active site (19Huang C.S. Moore W.R. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2464-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar,22Seelig G.F. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5092-5096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). l-Glu protects the mammalian enzyme from cystamine inactivation, suggesting the labeled Cys residue may be in thel-Glu binding site (23Seelig G.F. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3534-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These data have been used to suggest a role for this Cys residue in catalysis. Several other inhibitors that inactivate the enzyme are also thought to react to the same Cys residue (24Simondsen R.P. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 17134-17137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Schor N.F. Siuda J.F. Lomis T.J. Cheng B. Biochem J. 1990; 267: 291-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Comparison of the amino acid sequences for the enzymes that have been demonstrated to be inactivated by cystamine reveals only a single conserved Cys residue, T. bruceiγ-GCS Cys-319, suggesting this residue is likely to mediate the response to cystamine. However, the role of this residue in catalysis is unknown. We recently cloned T. brucei γ-GCS and reported preliminary enzyme characterization (20Lueder D.V. Phillips M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17485-17490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In this paper, we address the kinetic mechanism of γ-GCS from T. brucei and characterize the role of Cys-319 in cystamine inactivation and catalysis. TheT. brucei γ-GCS reaction mechanism is best described by a random ter-reactant mechanism. However, the mechanism also predicts that the binding affinities of some of the substrates are influenced by the prior binding of others. Our studies demonstrate that Cys-319 is the site of cystamine inactivation, but this residue does not play a significant role in substrate binding or catalysis. These studies suggest that cystamine inactivates the enzyme by blocking substrate access to the active site and not by labeling an essential active site residue. Reagents for the enzyme assay were purchased from Sigma, Ni2+-agarose and pREP4 were purchased from Qiagen. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described (37Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4880) Google Scholar) using an oligonucleotide (5′-ATGGTAAGCTGCAGGGCGTTGCAGCCC-3′) designed to incorporate a PstI site and to mutate Cys-319 to Ala (Fig. 1). Mutagenesis was performed in the Bluescript SK− (Strategene) vector using helper phage R408 (Strategene) and Escherichia coli strain BO265. A 1-kilobase pair fragment containing the mutation was subcloned to the expression constructs and verified by DNA sequencing. We previously reported the expression of γ-GCS as an N-terminal His6-tagged fusion protein under control of a T7 promoter (20Lueder D.V. Phillips M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17485-17490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We found better expression levels and greater purification can be obtained using a C-terminal His8 tag. The vector was constructed as follows. PCR primers were designed to insert a NsiI restriction site on the 5′ end of the gene and a TEV protease site followed by a SacII site on the 3′ end (sense primer = 5′-AAAATGCATCTTCTAACCACTGGCGGCCAG; antisense primer = 5′-AAACCGCGGGCCCTGAAAATAAGGATTCTCGTCGACCCCTTCGCGTTGTCTTTTACT). These primers were used to PCR the gene from pTB12.1 (20Lueder D.V. Phillips M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17485-17490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and the resulting PCR fragment was subcloned into the NsiI and SacII sites of pLOD11 (26Osterman A.L. Grishin N.V. Kinch L.N. Phillips M.A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13662-13667Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide linker, flanked with a SacII site on one side and aHindIII site on the other (sense oligonucleotide = 5′-GGCATCACCATCACCATCACCATCACTGAA; antisense oligonucleotide = 5′-ACGTTTCAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCCGC) was next used to place a His8 tag site at the C terminus of γ-GCS to yield the final expression construct, pTbCtag. The mutated fragment was cloned into theXbaI/SacI sites of pTbCtag, described above, to generate C-terminally tagged pTbC319A. wt-TbγGCS and TbC319A γGCS were expressed and purified from BL21/DE3 cells as described previously, except the cells were cotransformed with pREP4 (Qiagen) to more tightly regulate the protein expression. Approximately 10,000 freshly transformed colonies were used to inoculate 6 liters of LB, which was incubated at 37 °C. Protein expression was induced when cells reached 1 OD600 by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (0.2 mm) and the temperature was lowered to 27 °C. Cells were harvested by centrifugation 6–8 h after induction, resuspended, and lysed in buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol), containing protease inhibitors (2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml antipain, 20 μg/ml benzamidine, 2 μg/ml pepstatin, 2 μg/ml chymostatin), and 1 mg/ml lysozyme. After centrifugation (150,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C), the supernatant was applied to a Ni2+-agarose column (Qiagen) equilibrated in buffer A. The column was washed with buffer A containing 0.5m NaCl, and the His-tagged protein was eluted with a gradient of imidazole (0–250 mm) in buffer A. γ-GCS-containing fractions were dialyzed, concentrated in buffer A plus 1 mm β-octaglucoside, and applied to a Hi/Load Superdex 200 16/60 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in buffer A. The protein was determined to be greater than 98% pure by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis. The molecular mass of the purified enzyme is 77 kDa. All kinetic analysis was done on purified γ-GCS. γ-GCS activity was followed at 37 °C using a spectrophotometric assay, which couples ADP production to NADH oxidation as described (20Lueder D.V. Phillips M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17485-17490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 2 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.27 mm NADH) was mixed with type III rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase (5 units of 350–600 unit/mg of redissolved lyophilized powder; Sigma), type II rabbit muscle lactic acid dehydrogenase (10 units of 800–1200 unit/mg ammonium sulfate suspension; Sigma), and γ-GCS substrates to a final reaction volume of 0.5 ml. The assay was initiated by the addition of γ-GCS. l-α-aminobutyric acid (l-Aba) was used in place of l-Cys unless specified. For specific activity measurements, the concentrations of ATP, l-Aba, and l-Glu were 5, 100, and 10 mm, respectively. γ-GCS concentration ranged from 0.1 to 0.4 μm. The enzyme concentration was determined by measuring the OD280. The extinction coefficient forT. brucei γ-GCS was determined to be 1.35 (mg/ml)/OD as described (27Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5010) Google Scholar). Briefly, the extinction coefficient for denatured enzyme was determined based on its primary amino acid sequence by calculation using the ProtParam tool on the ExPASy web site. 2ProtParam is available via the World Wide Web (http://www.hcuge.ch). The enzyme was denatured in 6 m guanidinium-HCl, 0.02 mphosphate, pH 6.5, and the absorbance at 280 nm was determined. Using the extinction coefficient for the denatured enzyme, the protein concentration of the sample was determined. This concentration was used to determine the extinction coefficient of the native enzyme. NADH has been reported to be a competitive inhibitor of ATP for the rat γ-GCS-catalyzed reaction (14Yip B. Rudolph F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 3563-3568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, we observed no inhibitory effects of NADH on T. brucei γ-GCS in the range of 0.1–0.6 mm NADH. Thus, the concentration of NADH in the assay mix is not having an inhibitory effect on the enzyme. The time-dependent inhibitor cystamine was incubated with wt-TbγGCS and TbC319A γGCS for different times at various inhibitor concentrations. Aliquots of the reaction were removed and diluted 1/50 into a standard 0.5-ml reaction mixture, and the remaining activity was measured by the standard assay (above). β-Mercaptoethanol was removed from the enzyme preparation on a 10 × 30-cm Fast desalting column (Sephadex G-25; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) prior to these studies. To demonstrate that cystamine inactivation was irreversible, cystamine-inactivated wt-TbγGCS (incubated with 1 mm cystamine for 30 min) was run on the Fast desalting column to remove excess inhibitor prior to assay. Data to assess the kinetic mechanism was collected for wt-TbγGCS and TbC319A γ-GCS at a range of substrate concentrations. A complete matrix of rates as a function of substrate concentration (l-Glu, 0.1–8 mm; ATP, 0.04–2 mm;l-Aba, 2.5–100 mm) were collected such that for any given concentration of any one substrate the rates were measured over the entire range of the other two substrates. Curve fitting and modeling of the kinetic data was based on the rapid equilibrium rate equations (28Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics, Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar) and was performed using Sigma Plot (SPSS Inc.). Cys-319 in T. brucei γ-GCS (Fig. 1) was mutated to Ala and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The purified wild-typeT. brucei γ-GCS (wt-TbγGCS) and the Cys-319 to Ala mutant enzyme (TbC319A) both have k cat values of 2–3 s−1 in the presence of saturating concentrations of all three substrates (standard assay conditions described under “Experimental Procedures”). Thus, mutation of Cys-319 to Ala had no effect on the catalytic rate of the enzyme under these conditions. The wild-type enzyme is irreversibly inactivated by cystamine in a time-dependent reaction. Incubation of the wild-type enzyme with as little as 10 μm cystamine for 10 min results in 75% loss in enzyme activity (Fig. 2). The enzyme remains inactivated after removal of free cystamine by chromatography on Sephadex G-25. Similarly to the mammalian enzyme (22Seelig G.F. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5092-5096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), activity is partially restored by addition of a reduced thiol (10 mm dithiothreitol for 10 min). In contrast, TbC391A γ-GCS is completely resistant to cystamine inactivation, and the enzyme retains full activity even after incubation with 10 mmcystamine for 1 h (Fig. 2). A matrix of kinetic data was collected for wt-TbγGCS and TbC319A γ-GCS using a range of substrate concentrations, such that one substrate was held constant while the other two were varied. The procedure was repeated until all combinations of fixed and variable substrates had been collected (Fig. 3). Inspection of the Lineweaver-Burk plots indicates that the substrates form a ternary complex in the enzyme active site. A ping-pong mechanism is ruled out because the Lineweaver-Burk plots for all substrate combinations clearly converge (Fig. 3). Further variation of l-Glu and ATP in a constant ratio (1:10) versus varied l-Aba produces a series of Lineweaver-Burk plots (1/V versus1/[l-Aba]) that converge (Fig. 4). Similar results were obtained when varying l-Glu and l-Aba at a constant ratio (1:20) versus varied ATP (data not shown). These results demonstrate that a product release step does not occur between the binding of ATP or l-Glu and l-Aba or between the binding of l-Glu or l-Aba and ATP (28Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics, Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar). Thus our results are not consistent with the two possible ping-pong mechanisms in which: 1) ADP is released after phosphorylation ofl-Glu but prior to binding of l-Aba or 2) ADP is released after generation of a phosphorylated enzyme intermediate prior to the binding of the other substrates.Figure 4Lineweaver-Burk analysis of the variation ofl-Glu and l-ATP in a constant ration (1:10)versus varied l-Aba concentration.

Enzyme Kinetics, Behavior and Analysis of Rapid Equilibrium and Steady-state Enzyme Systems. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1975Google Scholar), which describe the various ter-reactant systems. The quality of the fit was assessed by examination of Lineweaver-Burk plots, by examination of the residual plots and by statistical analysis of the standard error of the fitted parameters and the correlation coefficient (R 2). After excluding the possible ping-pong mechanisms, 16 possible models were tested, including random, ordered (all 6 possibilities), ordered A random BC (3 possibilities), ordered B random AC (3 possibilities), and ordered C random AB (3 possibilities). The data for both wt-TbγGCS and TbC319A γ-GCS were best fit by the equation below for a rapid equilibrium random ter-reactant system, where K glu, K Aba,K ATP are the equilibrium dissociation constants (K d values) for the binding of substrate with freeE, and α, β, and γ are the interaction factors by which the dissociation constants of one substrate are influenced by the prior binding of one of the other substrates (Fig. 5). None of the other tested models provided a satisfactory fit to the data.vVmax=(Eq. 1) [Glu][Aba][ATP]αβγKGluKAbaKATP1+[Glu]KGlu+[Aba]KAba+[ATP]KATP+[Glu][Aba]γKGluKAba+[Glu][ATP]βKGluKATP+[Aba][ATP]αKAbaKATP+[Glu][Aba][ATP]αβγKGluKAbaKATPLineweaver-Burk plots for a representative data set of wt-TbγGCS fit to Equation 1 are displayed in Fig. 3, and the model derived parameters are reported in Table I. The kinetic constants derived from the random ter-reactant model are very similar for wt-TbγGCS and TbC319A γ-GCS (Table I). The specific activity (V max) is identical for the two enzymes, and no significant change is observed in the substrate dissociation constants as a result of the mutation. For both wt-TbγGCS and TbC319A γ-GCS, there is positive cooperatively between the binding sites of l-Glu and ATP (β = 0.06 for wt-TbγGCS and 0.04 for TbC319A γ-GCS). Therefore, the prior binding of ATP or l-Glu to the enzyme increases the binding affinity of the enzyme for the other substrate by 18-fold for the wild-type enzyme and by 23-fold for the mutant enzyme. In contrast, there is negative cooperatively between the binding sites ofl-Glu and l-Aba (γ = 6.3 for wt-TbγGCS and 5.0 for TbC319A); thus, the binding of one decreases the binding affinity of the other by 6.3-fold to the wild-type enzyme and by 5.0-fold to the mutant enzyme. ATP and l-Aba do not significantly effect the binding energies of each other, for either enzyme (α = 1).Table IKinetic constants derived for a random ter-reactant model of the γGCS mechanismwt-TbGCSTbC319AA.

In our previous paper, we reported for wt-TbγGCS that the apparentK m values for l-Glu, l-Aba, and ATP were 0.24, 10, and 0.07 mm, respectively (20Lueder D.V. Phillips M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17485-17490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). These values were obtained by varying the concentration of one substrate, while holding the concentrations of the other two substrates at saturating levels. Given the random mechanism for catalysis by TbγGCS, the Kmapp values describe the interaction of a given substrate to enzyme which is bound to the other two substrates. In contrast, K glu,K Aba, and K ATP are the model derived dissociation constants for the binding of each substrate to free enzyme. Because the prior binding of some substrates influences the binding affinity of others, the Kmapp values will not equal the model derived dissociation constants but will instead be best approximated by a combination of the K d and the binding interaction factors (e.g.Kmapp for l-Glu describes the binding of l-Glu to E*Aba*ATP and should be similar to the model derived constant βγK Glu (Fig. 5)). The model derived parameters βγK Glu, αγK Aba, and αβK ATP (Table I) are within the experimental errors of the reported Kmappvalues, providing good agreement between the data. Few studies have shed understanding on the nature of the γ-GCS active site. γ-GCS from several species, including T. brucei, is inactivated by cystamine. Prior studies on the mammalian enzyme suggested that the inactivation occurred by labeling of a Cys residue (19Huang C.S. Moore W.R. Meister A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 2464-2468Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 22Seelig G.F. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 5092-5096Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This residue was believed to be in thel-Glu binding site because l-Glu protects against inactivation, suggesting that the labeled Cys residue might be important for catalysis (23Seelig G.F. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3534-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A single Cys residue (Cys-319) is conserved among those enzymes reported to be sensitive to cystamine (Fig. 1). Mutagenesis of Cys-319 to Ala in T. brucei γ-GCS renders the enzyme resistant to cystamine inactivation, demonstrating that Cys-319 is the site of cystamine labeling in the wild-type enzyme. However, mutation of Cys-319 has no significant effect on the specific activity of the enzyme, on the reaction mechanism or on the substrate binding parameters. Thus, clearly Cys-319 does not play a significant role in catalysis or substrate binding. Instead, these data suggest that cystamine inactivates the enzyme by blocking access of substrates to the active site. The amino acid sequence of γ-GCS from L. donovani was recently reported, and it lacks Cys-319 (5Grondin K. Haimeur A. Mukhopadhyay R. Rosen B.P. Ouellette M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3057-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the L. donovani enzyme will be resistant to cystamine inactivation. The full kinetic profile of the Tbγ-GCS was obtained to determine the kinetic mechanism of the enzyme. The kinetic data collected for both wild-type and TbC319A T. brucei γ-GCS are best fit to the equation that describes a rapid equilibrium random ter-reactant mechanism in which significant dependences exist between the binding of some of the substrate pairs. There is a favorable interaction energy of 1.7 kcal/mol (ΔG interaction = −RTlnβK (Glu or ATP)/K (Glu or ATP)) between thel-Glu and ATP binding sites, an unfavorable interaction energy of 1.1 kcal/mol between the l-Glu andl-Aba binding sites, and no interaction between the ATP andl-Aba binding sites. These results are consistent with what is known about the reaction mechanism. ATP transfers the γ-phosphate to l-Glu, and the activated l-Glu undergoes nucleophilic attack by the amino group of l-Aba (11Orlowski M. Meister A. J. Biol.

Thus, uniquely the l-Glu binding site must be positioned so thatl-Glu can interact with both the other substrates, while ATP and l-Aba would not require direct interaction. It has been reported that low levels of ATP hydrolysis (<1% of the overall reaction) occurs in the absence of the other substrates and thatl-Glu inhibits this reaction (29Sekura R. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 2599-2605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The cooperativity between the l-Glu and ATP binding sites might be expected to reduce the extent of this unwanted side reaction. Several possible kinetic mechanisms have been proposed for mammalian γ-GCS, including partially ordered ter-reactant (14Yip B. Rudolph F.B. J. Biol.

Our data are not consistent with a ping-pong mechanism and supports the hypothesis that the substrates form a ternary complex on the enzyme prior to catalysis. In contrast to these other studies, our data clearly support a random mechanism for γ-GCS catalysis. However, because the substrates exhibit dependences on each other for binding, in the absence of the modern robust fitting techniques that allow the entire data set to be fit to the model simultaneously, this mechanism would be difficult to distinguish from the previously proposed partially ordered mechanisms (e.g.ordered A, random BC (14Yip B.

T. brucei γ-GCS could also exhibit species differences compared with mammalian γ-GCS, but we find that the recombinant human γ-GCS also follows a rapid equilibrium random mechanism. 3D. L. Brekken and M. A. Phillips, unpublished observation. T. brucei glutathionylspermidine synthetase, which catalyzes a similar reaction to γ-GCS, has also been reported to follow a rapid equilibrium random mechanism (30Koeing K. Menge U. Kiess M. Wray V. Flohe L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11908-11915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These data suggest that a random kinetic pattern is common among ATP-dependent peptide ligases. The model for the kinetic mechanism of γ-GCS reported in this paper provides a method to assess effects of mutations on the reaction as we have done for the TbC319A γ-GCS mutant. In addition, the activity of mammalian γ-GCS has been reported to be influenced by interaction with a regulatory subunit (31Huang C.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20578-20583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Huang C.S. Chang L.S. Anderson M.E. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19675-19680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The regulatory subunit decreases the apparent K m for l-Glu, but its effects on the reaction mechanism have not yet been addressed. A regulatory subunit has not yet been found associated with any of the non-mammalian enzymes, leaving open the possibility that differences in reaction mechanism may be present between the regulated mammalian enzyme and T. brucei γ-GCS. In the future, characterization of differences between these two enzyme will aid in the design of species-selective T. brucei inhibitors."
https://openalex.org/W1963968436,"Two Gram-positive Tet proteins, TetA(L) from Bacillus subtilis and TetK from aStaphylococcus aureus plasmid, have previously been suggested to have multiple catalytic modes and roles. These include: tetracycline (Tc)-metal/H+ antiport for both proteins (Yamaguchi, A., Shiina, Y., Fujihira, E., Sawai, T., Noguchi, N., and Sasatsu, M. (1995) FEBS Lett. 365, 193–197; Cheng, J. Guffanti, A. A., Wang, W., Krulwich, T. A., and Bechhofer, D. H. (1996) J. Bacteriol. 178, 2853–2860); Na+(K+)/H+ antiport for both proteins (Cheng et al. (1996)); and an electrical potential-dependent K+ leak mode for TetK and highly truncated segments thereof that can facilitate net K+ uptake (Guay, G. G., Tuckman, M., McNicholas, P., and Rothstein, D. M. (1993) J. Bacteriol.175, 4927–4929). Studies of membrane vesicles from Escherichia coli expressing low levels of complete and 3′-truncated versions of tetA(L) or tetK, now show that the full-length versions of both transporters catalyze electrogenic antiport and that demonstration of electrogenicity depends upon use of a low chloride buffer for the assay. The K+ uptake mode, assayed via 86Rb+ uptake, was also catalyzed by both full-length TetA(L) and TetK. This mode does not represent a potential-dependent leak. Such a leak was not demonstrable in energized membrane vesicles. Rather, Rb+uptake occurred in right-side-out vesicles when the intravesicular space contained either Na+ or K+ but not choline. If an outwardly directed gradient of Na+ or K+ was present, Rb+ uptake occurred without energization in vesicles from cells transformed with a plasmid containing tetA(L) or tetK but not a control plasmid. Experiments in which a comparable exchange was carried out in low chloride buffers to which oxonol was added confirmed that the exchange was electrogenic. Thus, the K+ uptake mode is proposed to be a mode of the electrogenic monovalent cation/H+ antiport activity of TetA(L) and TetK in which K+ takes the place of the external protons. Truncated TetK and TetA(L) failed to catalyze either Tc-metal/H+ or Na+/H+ antiport in energized everted vesicles. Truncated TetK, but not TetA(L), did, however, exhibit modest, electrogenic Na+(K+)/Rb+ exchange as well as a small, potential-dependent leak of Rb+. The C-terminal halves of the TetA(L) and TetK proteins are thus required both for proton-coupled active transport activities of the multifunctional transporter and, perhaps, for minimizing cation leakiness.

The antibiotic thus enters the cell best under neutral and acidic pH conditions and could inhibit cell protein synthesis strongly in sensitive cells in this pH range. Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative Tet efflux proteins catalyze similar exchange reactions which prevent cytoplasmic accumulation of the antibiotic. Tc is actively extruded, as a complex with a divalent cation that bears a single positive charge, in exchange for external H+ (2Yamaguchi A. Udagawa T. Sawai T. J. Biol.

The smaller (12-transmembrane segments) Gram-negative Tet proteins and the larger (14-transmembrane segments) Gram-positive Tet proteins share sequence similarity largely in the N-terminal six transmembrane segments regions (4Levy S.B.

Gene (Amst .). 1993; 124: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) but at least some motifs and/or residues in the C-terminal halves of each type of Tc efflux protein cannot be modified without loss of activity (6Fijihira E.

Both the Gram-negative and Gram-positive Tet protein families contain examples that have further been shown to complement K+-uptake deficient mutants of Escherichia coli(8Dosch D.C. Salvacion F.F.

It has been attributed to an electrical potential-dependent K+ leak that could also be conferred by truncated forms of proteins that exhibit the property (10Griffith J.K. Kogoma T. Corvo D.L.

Recently, studies in this laboratory have shown that the chromosomally encoded Bacillus subtilis TetA(L) protein and closely related TetK from a Staphylococcus aureusplasmid catalyze Na+(K+)/H+antiport (13Cheng J.

Chem. 1990; 265: 4809-4813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Cheng J. Guffanti A.A. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol.

These exchanges were evidently electrogenic, as assayed via energy-dependent Tc-cobalt or Na+ uptake by everted vesicles of E. coli that expressed a clonedtetA(L) gene from a weak promoter (14Guffanti A.A. Krulwich T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4557-4561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The exchanges were not inhibited by low nigericin concentrations that reduce the ΔpH but were significantly inhibited by valinomycin in the presence of K+, a combination that abolished the ΔΨ generated by respiration (14Guffanti A.A. Krulwich T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4557-4561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistently, the antiports catalyzed by purified and reconstituted TetA(L) could be energized by an imposed potential (16Cheng J. Hicks D.B. Krulwich T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14446-14451Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, the important role of TetA(L) in acidifying the cytoplasm of B. subtilis relative to the external medium during growth at alkaline pH would require that the monovalent cation/H+mode be electrogenic (15Cheng J. Guffanti A.A. Wang W. Krulwich T.A. Bechhofer D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2853-2860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18McNab R.M. Castle A.M. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 637-647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Since TetK could substitute for TetA(L) in a mutant of B. subtilis that had a disruptedtetA(L) gene, TetK is presumed to catalyze an electrogenic antiport similar to TetA(L). By contrast, the Tc-metal/H+antiport catalyzed by Gram-negative Tet proteins has been proposed to be electroneutral (19Kaneko M. Yamaguchi A. Sawai T. FEBS Lett. 1985; 193: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Moreover, Yamaguchi and colleagues (3Yamaguchi A. Shiina Y. Fujihira E. Sawai T. Noguchi N. Sasatsu M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20Hirata T. Wakatabe R. Nielsen J. Someya Y. Fujihira E. Kimura T. Yamaguchi A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) have experienced difficulty in demonstrating the Na+/H+ activity of TetK and indicate that the Tc-metal/H+ antiport activity of TetK appeared to be electroneutral in preliminary work. One of the goals of the current study, therefore, was to examine the Tc-metal/H+ and Na+/H+ antiport activities of TetA(L) and TetK side-by-side in comparable preparations and to clarify their electrogenicity versus electroneutrality. The studies have strongly supported the multifunctional and electrogenic nature of both TetA(L) and TetK.A second major goal of the studies was to test an alternate hypothesis to the putative K+ leak in explaining the ability of Tet proteins such as TetK to complement K+ uptake-deficientE. coli. The new hypothesis arises from the discovery that these Tet proteins are electrogenic monovalent cation/H+antiporters, i.e. have a catalytic mode in which cytoplasmic Na+ or K+ is exchanged for a greater number of external H+. If K+ were able to occupy the external H+ sites, then an exchange of cytoplasmic monovalent cation for a greater number of K+ could account for the net uptake of K+ (Fig. 1). Thus, the net uptake of K+ catalyzed by a Tet protein could be one of its normal catalytic modes. Experiments were designed to test this hypothesis with TetK and to examine whether TetA(L), to which this kind of activity had never been attributed, might nonetheless possess a comparable capacity. If the capacity to catalyze net K+ uptake was in fact a function of the monovalent cation antiport mode, then TetA(L) might well demonstrate it. Or, a capacity to catalyze net K+uptake might be restricted to those Tet proteins with both monovalent cation/H+ exchange activity and a particularly high affinity for K+. Both cloned TetA(L) and TetK were shown to restore Na+ exclusion capacity and resistance to a ΔtetA(L) strain of B. subtilis. In such experiments, the Na+ exclusion capacity of TetK, but not of TetA(L), was markedly reduced by the presence of K+. This suggested a higher K+ relative to Na+ affinity for TetK than for TetA(L) (15Cheng J. Guffanti A.A. Wang W. Krulwich T.A. Bechhofer D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2853-2860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The current studies support the hypothesis that net K+ uptake catalyzed by full-length forms of TetA(L) and TetK is a mode of the Na+(K+)/H+ exchange of both proteins.DISCUSSIONThe studies conducted here confirm and extend earlier work indicating that both TetA(L) and TetK are multifunctional antiporters that catalyze electrogenic Tc-metal/H+ and Na+/H+ antiport. The successful demonstration of both of these activities and their electrogenicity clearly depends upon low expression levels of the proteins. Higher levels of expression make both cells and membrane leaky. For experiments in which ionophores are used to assess electrogenicity in an E. coli vesicle system, it is further important to use ionophore concentrations that avoid aberrant exchanges and to reduce the concentration of chloride sufficiently to avoid dissipation of the ΔΨ by the permeant anion alone. The totality of earlier experiments supports the conclusion by Kaneko and co-workers (19Kaneko M. Yamaguchi A. Sawai T. FEBS Lett. 1985; 193: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) that TetA(B) catalyzes a largely electroneutral Tc-metal/H+ antiport. However, these authors themselves indicate some discrepancies in their findings with the conclusion of complete electroneutrality, and the issue might merit re-examination. As discussed below, the specific catalytic properties and possible multifunctional features are important factors in the design of strategies to minimize the interference of antibiotic efflux systems with use of antimicrobial therapies.The truncated versions of TetA(L) and TetK failed to exhibit any of the energy-dependent, proton-coupled activities of the full-length proteins, consistent with the evidence that residues in the C-terminal halves of TetK cannot be mutated without loss of active Tc efflux capacity (6Fijihira E. Kimura T. Yamaguchi A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, there were some modest but reproducible protective effects of the truncated Tet proteins in the whole cell growth complementation experiments (Table I). Possibly the truncated forms retain the capacity to bind Tc, Tc-metal, and monovalent cations, and this accounts for those effects. Such a basis for modest complementation in similar experiments has previously been noted (33Ivey D.M. Guffanti A.A. Shen Z. Kudyan N. Krulwich T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The current studies add a catalytic mode to the repertoire of the Gram-positive Tet proteins, i.e. a mode in which net K+ uptake is achieved via a full catalytic cycle in which more than one K+ is taken up in exchange for a single cytoplasmic Na+ or K+. Clearly, the full-length TetA(L) and TetK do not confer a leakiness upon E. colimembranes to K+ that allows electrogenic K+entry (even down its chemical concentration gradient) in response to energization and establishment of a sizeable Δψ, inside-negative. The generation of a potential, inside-positive, during Na+(K+)/Rb+ exchange by unenergized vesicles is consistent with the operation of the whole catalytic antiport cycle but with the external Rb+ substituting for H+. Were only a partial cycle to be used for the exchange, the Rb+ accumulation would represent counterflow entirely,i.e. with the intravesicular cation transported outward down its gradient, released, and then replaced on the outside with the external Rb+ without use of the “H+” sites. In that case, the exchange should have been electroneutral. The occupation of a cation site by either K+ or H+has similarly been proposed for the complete catalytic cycle of the eukaryotic serotonin transporter (34Keyes S.R. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1172-1176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It will be important to confirm the modest exchange capacity of the truncated TetK (as well as the possible leak) and the lack of a comparable activity by truncated TetA(L) in a purified reconstituted system in which the amount of transporter protein incorporated into the proteoliposome can be made comparable for different versions of the proteins. If Tet-mediated, electrogenic Rb+(K+) uptake depends upon the use of the H+-binding site and translocation pathway by these cations, and if the C-terminal part of the protein is required for proton binding and/or translocation, then even modest net Rb+ accumulation by truncated TetK is unanticipated under non-leaky conditions.The finding that net K+ uptake by full-length Tet proteins is definitely a mode of the normal catalytic functions rather than a leak, is consistent with the robust growth of cells expressing low levels of these proteins. It is notable that TetA(L) behaved qualitatively similar to TetK although it had not earlier been implicated as having the capacity for net K+ uptake. As hypothesized at the start of the study, this capacity may be a correlate of possession by a Tet protein of Na+(K+)/H+ antiporter activity and the extent to which this property occurs broadly among Tet proteins has not been carefully examined. Another question of interest in connection with the net K+ uptake mode is whether it may have a physiological role, e.g. at particular pH values and/or K+ concentrations. It will be of importance to examine the possibility that the Gram-negative TetA(C) (e.g. from pBR322 or pACYC184) might catalyze a similar spectrum of activities to that shown here for the Gram-positive Tet proteins. TetA(C) is among the Tet proteins that can complement K+ uptake-deficient mutants of E. coli (8Dosch D.C. Salvacion F.F. Epstein W. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Griffith J.K. Cuellar D.H. Fordyce C.A. Hutchings K.C. Mondragon A.A. Mol. Membr.

Moreover, this gene has been shown to have a beneficial effect on the “fitness” of adapted E. coliin the absence of antibiotic (35Lenski R.E. Simpson S.C. Nguyen T.T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3140-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar); this could reflect enhanced Na+-resistance and K+ retrieval under some conditions. Whether TetK confers such a benefit on S. aureuswill also be of interest to examine. Considerable current effort is directed toward reducing the prevalence and further spread of antibiotic-resistance genes among pathogenic bacteria or other organisms that might then transfer these genes to pathogens. In assessments of those conditions that will minimize positive selection for antibiotic efflux genes of particular types, e.g. tet genes, the full panoply of roles for the given efflux protein will be important information. For example, it might be important to consider the pH, Na+, and K+concentration to which the organisms are exposed, rather than simply the exposure to Tc, when evaluating strategies for decreasing the prevalence of TetA(L) or TetK. Tc1 enters bacterial cells in a non-carrier dependent fashion that is promoted by a transmembrane pH gradient, acid out (1Yamaguchi A. Ohmori H. Kaneko-Phadera M. Nomura T. Sawai T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1991; 35: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The antibiotic thus enters the cell best under neutral and acidic pH conditions and could inhibit cell protein synthesis strongly in sensitive cells in this pH range. Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative Tet efflux proteins catalyze similar exchange reactions which prevent cytoplasmic accumulation of the antibiotic. Tc is actively extruded, as a complex with a divalent cation that bears a single positive charge, in exchange for external H+ (2Yamaguchi A. Udagawa T. Sawai T. J. Biol.

Recently, studies in this laboratory have shown that the chromosomally encoded Bacillus subtilis TetA(L) protein and closely related TetK from a Staphylococcus aureusplasmid catalyze Na+(K+)/H+antiport (13Cheng J.

Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 852-857Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in addition to Tc−-Me2+/H+ antiport (2Yamaguchi A. Udagawa T. Sawai T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4809-4813Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Cheng J. Guffanti A.A. Krulwich T.A. J. Biol.

These exchanges were evidently electrogenic, as assayed via energy-dependent Tc-cobalt or Na+ uptake by everted vesicles of E. coli that expressed a clonedtetA(L) gene from a weak promoter (14Guffanti A.A. Krulwich T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4557-4561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The exchanges were not inhibited by low nigericin concentrations that reduce the ΔpH but were significantly inhibited by valinomycin in the presence of K+, a combination that abolished the ΔΨ generated by respiration (14Guffanti A.A. Krulwich T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4557-4561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consistently, the antiports catalyzed by purified and reconstituted TetA(L) could be energized by an imposed potential (16Cheng J. Hicks D.B. Krulwich T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14446-14451Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). In addition, the important role of TetA(L) in acidifying the cytoplasm of B. subtilis relative to the external medium during growth at alkaline pH would require that the monovalent cation/H+mode be electrogenic (15Cheng J. Guffanti A.A. Wang W. Krulwich T.A. Bechhofer D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2853-2860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18McNab R.M. Castle A.M. Biophys. J. 1987; 52: 637-647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Since TetK could substitute for TetA(L) in a mutant of B. subtilis that had a disruptedtetA(L) gene, TetK is presumed to catalyze an electrogenic antiport similar to TetA(L). By contrast, the Tc-metal/H+antiport catalyzed by Gram-negative Tet proteins has been proposed to be electroneutral (19Kaneko M. Yamaguchi A. Sawai T. FEBS Lett. 1985; 193: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Moreover, Yamaguchi and colleagues (3Yamaguchi A. Shiina Y. Fujihira E. Sawai T. Noguchi N. Sasatsu M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 20Hirata T. Wakatabe R. Nielsen J. Someya Y. Fujihira E. Kimura T. Yamaguchi A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 337-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) have experienced difficulty in demonstrating the Na+/H+ activity of TetK and indicate that the Tc-metal/H+ antiport activity of TetK appeared to be electroneutral in preliminary work. One of the goals of the current study, therefore, was to examine the Tc-metal/H+ and Na+/H+ antiport activities of TetA(L) and TetK side-by-side in comparable preparations and to clarify their electrogenicity versus electroneutrality. The studies have strongly supported the multifunctional and electrogenic nature of both TetA(L) and TetK. A second major goal of the studies was to test an alternate hypothesis to the putative K+ leak in explaining the ability of Tet proteins such as TetK to complement K+ uptake-deficientE. coli. The new hypothesis arises from the discovery that these Tet proteins are electrogenic monovalent cation/H+antiporters, i.e. have a catalytic mode in which cytoplasmic Na+ or K+ is exchanged for a greater number of external H+. If K+ were able to occupy the external H+ sites, then an exchange of cytoplasmic monovalent cation for a greater number of K+ could account for the net uptake of K+ (Fig. 1). Thus, the net uptake of K+ catalyzed by a Tet protein could be one of its normal catalytic modes. Experiments were designed to test this hypothesis with TetK and to examine whether TetA(L), to which this kind of activity had never been attributed, might nonetheless possess a comparable capacity. If the capacity to catalyze net K+ uptake was in fact a function of the monovalent cation antiport mode, then TetA(L) might well demonstrate it. Or, a capacity to catalyze net K+uptake might be restricted to those Tet proteins with both monovalent cation/H+ exchange activity and a particularly high affinity for K+. Both cloned TetA(L) and TetK were shown to restore Na+ exclusion capacity and resistance to a ΔtetA(L) strain of B. subtilis. In such experiments, the Na+ exclusion capacity of TetK, but not of TetA(L), was markedly reduced by the presence of K+. This suggested a higher K+ relative to Na+ affinity for TetK than for TetA(L) (15Cheng J. Guffanti A.A. Wang W. Krulwich T.A. Bechhofer D.H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 2853-2860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The current studies support the hypothesis that net K+ uptake catalyzed by full-length forms of TetA(L) and TetK is a mode of the Na+(K+)/H+ exchange of both proteins. DISCUSSIONThe studies conducted here confirm and extend earlier work indicating that both TetA(L) and TetK are multifunctional antiporters that catalyze electrogenic Tc-metal/H+ and Na+/H+ antiport. The successful demonstration of both of these activities and their electrogenicity clearly depends upon low expression levels of the proteins. Higher levels of expression make both cells and membrane leaky. For experiments in which ionophores are used to assess electrogenicity in an E. coli vesicle system, it is further important to use ionophore concentrations that avoid aberrant exchanges and to reduce the concentration of chloride sufficiently to avoid dissipation of the ΔΨ by the permeant anion alone. The totality of earlier experiments supports the conclusion by Kaneko and co-workers (19Kaneko M. Yamaguchi A. Sawai T. FEBS Lett. 1985; 193: 194-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) that TetA(B) catalyzes a largely electroneutral Tc-metal/H+ antiport. However, these authors themselves indicate some discrepancies in their findings with the conclusion of complete electroneutrality, and the issue might merit re-examination. As discussed below, the specific catalytic properties and possible multifunctional features are important factors in the design of strategies to minimize the interference of antibiotic efflux systems with use of antimicrobial therapies.The truncated versions of TetA(L) and TetK failed to exhibit any of the energy-dependent, proton-coupled activities of the full-length proteins, consistent with the evidence that residues in the C-terminal halves of TetK cannot be mutated without loss of active Tc efflux capacity (6Fijihira E. Kimura T. Yamaguchi A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 419: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, there were some modest but reproducible protective effects of the truncated Tet proteins in the whole cell growth complementation experiments (Table I). Possibly the truncated forms retain the capacity to bind Tc, Tc-metal, and monovalent cations, and this accounts for those effects. Such a basis for modest complementation in similar experiments has previously been noted (33Ivey D.M. Guffanti A.A. Shen Z. Kudyan N. Krulwich T.A. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The current studies add a catalytic mode to the repertoire of the Gram-positive Tet proteins, i.e. a mode in which net K+ uptake is achieved via a full catalytic cycle in which more than one K+ is taken up in exchange for a single cytoplasmic Na+ or K+. Clearly, the full-length TetA(L) and TetK do not confer a leakiness upon E. colimembranes to K+ that allows electrogenic K+entry (even down its chemical concentration gradient) in response to energization and establishment of a sizeable Δψ, inside-negative. The generation of a potential, inside-positive, during Na+(K+)/Rb+ exchange by unenergized vesicles is consistent with the operation of the whole catalytic antiport cycle but with the external Rb+ substituting for H+. Were only a partial cycle to be used for the exchange, the Rb+ accumulation would represent counterflow entirely,i.e. with the intravesicular cation transported outward down its gradient, released, and then replaced on the outside with the external Rb+ without use of the “H+” sites. In that case, the exchange should have been electroneutral. The occupation of a cation site by either K+ or H+has similarly been proposed for the complete catalytic cycle of the eukaryotic serotonin transporter (34Keyes S.R. Rudnick G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 1172-1176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It will be important to confirm the modest exchange capacity of the truncated TetK (as well as the possible leak) and the lack of a comparable activity by truncated TetA(L) in a purified reconstituted system in which the amount of transporter protein incorporated into the proteoliposome can be made comparable for different versions of the proteins. If Tet-mediated, electrogenic Rb+(K+) uptake depends upon the use of the H+-binding site and translocation pathway by these cations, and if the C-terminal part of the protein is required for proton binding and/or translocation, then even modest net Rb+ accumulation by truncated TetK is unanticipated under non-leaky conditions.The finding that net K+ uptake by full-length Tet proteins is definitely a mode of the normal catalytic functions rather than a leak, is consistent with the robust growth of cells expressing low levels of these proteins. It is notable that TetA(L) behaved qualitatively similar to TetK although it had not earlier been implicated as having the capacity for net K+ uptake. As hypothesized at the start of the study, this capacity may be a correlate of possession by a Tet protein of Na+(K+)/H+ antiporter activity and the extent to which this property occurs broadly among Tet proteins has not been carefully examined. Another question of interest in connection with the net K+ uptake mode is whether it may have a physiological role, e.g. at particular pH values and/or K+ concentrations. It will be of importance to examine the possibility that the Gram-negative TetA(C) (e.g. from pBR322 or pACYC184) might catalyze a similar spectrum of activities to that shown here for the Gram-positive Tet proteins. TetA(C) is among the Tet proteins that can complement K+ uptake-deficient mutants of E. coli (8Dosch D.C. Salvacion F.F. Epstein W. J. Bacteriol. 1984; 160: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Griffith J.K. Cuellar D.H. Fordyce C.A. Hutchings K.C. Mondragon A.A. Mol. Membr.

Moreover, this gene has been shown to have a beneficial effect on the “fitness” of adapted E. coliin the absence of antibiotic (35Lenski R.E. Simpson S.C. Nguyen T.T. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 3140-3147Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar); this could reflect enhanced Na+-resistance and K+ retrieval under some conditions. Whether TetK confers such a benefit on S. aureuswill also be of interest to examine. Considerable current effort is directed toward reducing the prevalence and further spread of antibiotic-resistance genes among pathogenic bacteria or other organisms that might then transfer these genes to pathogens. In assessments of those conditions that will minimize positive selection for antibiotic efflux genes of particular types, e.g. tet genes, the full panoply of roles for the given efflux protein will be important information. For example, it might be important to consider the pH, Na+, and K+concentration to which the organisms are exposed, rather than simply the exposure to Tc, when evaluating strategies for decreasing the prevalence of TetA(L) or TetK. The studies conducted here confirm and extend earlier work indicating that both TetA(L) and TetK are multifunctional antiporters that catalyze electrogenic Tc-metal/H+ and Na+/H+ antiport.

https://openalex.org/W2084991434,"Escherichia coli responds to K+ limitation or high osmolarity by induction of thekdpFABC operon coding for the high affinity K+-translocating Kdp-ATPase. KdpD, the sensor kinase of this system, is a bifunctional enzyme catalyzing the autophosphorylation by ATP and the dephosphorylation of the corresponding response regulator KdpE. Here we demonstrate that individual replacements of clustered arginine residues located close to transmembrane domain TM4 modulate the ratio of kinase to phosphatase activity. Thus KdpD-Arg511 → Gln is characterized by an increase in the kinase activity and a loss of the phosphatase activity. However, when Arg at position 511 is replaced with Lys, activities of the corresponding protein are comparable with wild-type KdpD. In contrast, replacement of arginine residues at positions 503, 506, or 508 with glutamine or lysine causes a decrease of the kinase and an increase of the phosphatase activities. Changes of the activities of these KdpD proteins correspond with alterations in kdpFABCexpression. Thus KdpD-Arg511 → Gln causes constitutive expression of kdpFABC. KdpD proteins with Arg replacements at positions 503, 506, or 508 are unable to respond to osmolarity, whereas the sensing of K+ limitation is not influenced. Simultaneous replacement of arginine residues 508 and 511 or 506, 508, and 511 with glutamine leads to a decrease of the phosphatase activity. However, kdpFABC expression is dependent on K+and osmolarity. Finally, when Arg513 is replaced with glutamine the amount of KdpD detected in the membrane is drastically reduced. These results imply that there is an equilibrium between the kinase and phosphatase activities of KdpD, which can be shifted by the replacement of one arginine residue. An electrostatic switch mechanism within the protein is proposed through which the ratio of kinase to phosphatase is regulated. Finally, these results lend support to the notion that KdpD can be activated by two distinct stimuli, K+ limitation and osmolarity. Escherichia coli responds to K+ limitation or high osmolarity by induction of thekdpFABC operon coding for the high affinity K+-translocating Kdp-ATPase.

The high affinity K+-transport complex KdpFABC is one of several transport systems that accumulate K+ in Escherichia coli (see Ref. 1Altendorf K. Epstein W. Lee A.G. Biomembranes. 5. JAI Press Inc., London1996: 403-420Google Scholar for review). Expression of thekdpFABC operon is regulated by KdpD and KdpE, which constitute a typical sensor kinase/response regulator system (2Walderhaug M.O. Polarek J.W. Voelkner P. Daniel J.M. Hesse J.E. Altendorf K. Epstein W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2152-2159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Polarek J.W. Williams G. Epstein W. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 2145-2151Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The sensor kinase KdpD is anchored with four transmembrane domains in the cytoplasmic membrane (4Voelkner P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Furthermore, KdpD consists of two extended N- and C-terminal domains which are exposed to the cytoplasm (5Zimmann P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28282-28288Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Upon stimulus perception KdpD undergoes autophosphorylation. Subsequently the phosphoryl group is transferred to the response regulator KdpE. Phosphorylated KdpE exhibits an increased affinity for a 23-base pair sequence immediately upstream of the canonical −35 and −10 regions of thekdpFABC promoter (6Sugiura A. Nakashima K. Tanaka K. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 1769-1776Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Consequently, the phosphorylated KdpE triggers kdpFABC transcription efficiently in response to the stimulus. Using purified proteins the enzymatic activities of KdpD and KdpE were demonstrated in vitro (7Jung K. Tjaden B. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10847-10852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In addition, it was shown that KdpD catalyzes the dephosphorylation of KdpE∼P (7Jung K. Tjaden B. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10847-10852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) with concomitant release of inorganic phosphate. 1K. Jung, unpublished data.1K. Jung, unpublished data. This phosphatase activity of KdpD can be significantly increased in the presence of ATP or nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs, whereas other nucleotides have no effect (8Jung K. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17406-17410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The signal that KdpD senses to phosphorylate itself is believed to be turgor pressure or some effect thereof reflecting the role of K+ as an important cytoplasmic osmotic solute (9Laimins L.A. Rhoads D.B. Epstein W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 10Epstein W. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1992; 146: 193-199Google Scholar). ThekdpFABC operon is induced under K+-limiting growth conditions (below 2 mm). In mutants lacking all other K+-translocating transport systems (TrkG, TrkH, and Kup), kdpFABC is expressed in media containing 50 mm K+ or less. There is no correlation of kdpFABC expression with internal K+concentration when this parameter is altered by changing medium osmolarity. Therefore, neither the external nor the internal concentration of K+ seems to be sensed, but what might be called the “need” for K+ to maintain turgor. Control by turgor is supported by the finding that a sudden increase in medium osmolarity, which reduces turgor, transiently turns on expression of kdpFABC (9Laimins L.A. Rhoads D.B. Epstein W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 10Epstein W. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1992; 146: 193-199Google Scholar). This model has been challenged recently by the finding that kdpFABC expression is only significantly induced when the osmolarity of the medium is increased by a salt and not by a sugar (11Sutherland L. Cairney J. Elmore M.J. Booth I.R. Higgins C.F. J. Bacteriol. 1986; 168: 805-814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Asha H. Gowrishankar J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 4528-4537Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 2K. Jung and K. Altendorf, unpublished observations.2K. Jung and K. Altendorf, unpublished observations.Analysis of mutants of KdpD that express kdpFABCconstitutively independent of the K+ concentration of the medium but retain the ability to respond to changes in medium osmolarity led to the suggestion that KdpD senses two stimuli, decrease in turgor and K+ concentration (13Sugiura A. Hirokawa K. Nakashima K. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Amino acid substitutions in these mutants were particularly located in the transmembrane domains TM3 and TM4 and around a region of positively charged amino acid residues in KdpD (Fig. 1). Due to the clustering of basic residues we postulated an electrostatic interaction of these residues with the acidic head groups of the phospholipids that might be involved in the activation of KdpD in response to an environmental stimulus. Such a mechanism of reversible protein-membrane interaction was for example thoroughly studied for the myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (14McLaughlin S. Aderem A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 272-276Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar). In this paper we study the effect of the individual replacements of Arg residues at positions 503, 506, 508, 511, and 513 on the in vivo and in vitro activities of the corresponding KdpD proteins. We found that individual substitutions of these residues lead to a shift in the ratio of the phosphatase to kinase activities and alterations of kdpFABC expression. Surprisingly, replacement of different residues results in opposite effects. [γ-32P]ATP, [α-35S]ATP, and NAP10 columns to remove ATP were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.

Acta. 1998; 1372: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) kdpD was cloned into vector pKK223-3; expression of kdpD is under the control of the tac promoter. In plasmid pBD kdpD was cloned into pBAD18 (18Guzman L.-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3876) Google Scholar), in which expression of kdpD is under the control of the arabinose promoter. To facilitate mutant construction, two unique restriction sites,KpnI (1587) MluI (1715) (numbers in parentheses correspond to the nucleotide position in the kdpD sequence) were introduced by silent mutation into plasmid pPV5-1 resulting in plasmid pPV5-3 using PCR.3Restriction analysis and DNA sequencing confirmed the existence of the newly restriction sites. Subsequently, individual substitution of the Arg residues at positions 503, 506, 508, 511, and 513 was achieved by PCR. All site-specific mutations were directed by synthetic mutagenic oligonucleotide primers, including the recognition site forMluI. Oligonucleotide primers were designed to change codons of these Arg residues to codons encoding Gln or Lys. Furthermore, one oligonucleotide primer was designed to change codons of Arg residues 508 and 511 simultaneously to codons of Gln, with another primer codons of Arg residues 506, 508, and 511 were simultaneously changed to codons of Gln.

Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6769) Google Scholar). PCR products were purified in agarose gels and digested with appropriate restriction enzymes. All of these kdpD constructs were cloned into pBAD18 (18Guzman L.-M. Belin D. Carson M.J. Beckwith J. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4121-4130Crossref PubMed Scopus (3876) Google Scholar) using XmaI and HindIII restrictions sites resulting in plasmid pBD and its derivatives. Mutations were verified by sequencing each PCR-generated DNA segment through the ligation junctions in double-stranded plasmid DNA, using the dideoxynucleotide termination method (20Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulsen A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52242) Google Scholar) and synthetic sequencing primers after alkaline denaturation (21Hattori M. Sakaki Y. Anal. Biochem. 1986; 152: 232-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). E. coli strain TKR2000 transformed with plasmid pPV5-3 carrying different kdpD mutations was grown aerobically at 37 °C in KML complex medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 1% KCl) supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Cells were harvested at an absorbance at 600 nm of ∼1.0 and disrupted using a Ribi press. Inverted membrane vesicles were prepared as described previously (7Jung K. Tjaden B. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10847-10852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation assays were carried out as described previously (8Jung K. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17406-17410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Briefly, autophosphorylation of KdpD was tested with KdpD in inverted membrane vesicles in the presence of 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mNaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, and 20 μm [γ-32P]ATP (2.38 Ci/mmol). To test the transfer of the phosphoryl group an equal amount of purified KdpE (prepared as described in Ref. 23Puppe W. Zimmann P. Jung K. Lucassen M. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25027-25034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) was added. To test dephosphorylation, KdpE was first phosphorylated with wild-type KdpD. Subsequently, KdpD-containing membrane vesicles were removed by centrifugation, and ATP was removed by gel filtration through Sephadex G-25. Dephosphorylation was initiated by addition of 20 mmMgCl2, 20 μm ATP, and KdpD in inverted membrane vesicles. Samples were immediately subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205498) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of the proteins was quantified by image analysis using the PhosphorImager SI of Molecular Dynamics. In vivosignal transduction was probed with E. coli strain HAK006 transformed with the plasmids described. Cells were grown in TY medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract) (13Sugiura A. Hirokawa K. Nakashima K. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) or minimal medium (24Epstein W. J. Bacteriol. 1970; 101: 836-843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) supplemented with NaCl, sucrose, and KCl as indicated. Cells were grown to midlogarithmic growth phase and harvested by centrifugation. β-Galactosidase activity was determined as described (25Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 72-74Google Scholar) and is given in Miller units. Protein was assayed by the method of Peterson (26Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7065) Google Scholar) using bovine serum albumin as standard. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (22Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205498) Google Scholar) using 9 or 12% acrylamide gels. Immunodetection of KdpD proteins with polyclonal antibodies against KdpD was performed as described in Ref. 4Voelkner P. Puppe W. Altendorf K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 217: 1019-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar. Immunoblots were scanned and subjected to image analysis using the program provided by Molecular Dynamics. Equal amounts of protein of inverted membrane vesicles containing KdpD with different Arg replacements were subjected to Western blot analysis. The modified KdpD proteins were produced in amounts comparable with wild-type KdpD with one exception: KdpD-R513Q. The amount of this KdpD protein was determined to be 1% compared with wild-type KdpD (100% value) (data not shown). In a recent study the time course of autophosphorylation of KdpD was described (8Jung K. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17406-17410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation was found to be linear within 0.5 min. Subsequently, the phosphoryl group is transferred to the response regulator KdpE, which is completed within 15 s (the time necessary to stop the reaction manually). The phosphorylated response regulator KdpE alone is very stable; within 2 h no significant loss of the phosphoryl group was detected. Dephosphorylation of KdpE∼P can be initiated by the addition of membrane-bound KdpD in the presence of MgCl2 and ATP or nonhydrolyzable ATP analogs. With wild-type KdpD about half of the phosphorylated KdpE is dephosphorylated within 5 min. In the absence of ATP or ATP analogs, very slow dephosphorylation is observed (8Jung K. Altendorf K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17406-17410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The influence of Arg replacements in KdpD on these enzymatic activities was tested, and values are presented as percentage of wild-type activities (Fig. 2). Interestingly, two different types of KdpD proteins emerge from the analysis. The first type includes KdpD-R511Q, which is characterized by an increase in the kinase activity and a loss of the phosphatase activity. The second type comprises KdpD-R503Q, KdpD-R506Q, and KdpD-R508Q. These proteins are characterized by an increase in the phosphatase activity and a lower kinase activity compared with wild-type KdpD. Due to the low amount of KdpD-R513Q inserted into the membrane, kinase activity of this protein was drastically reduced (1% of wild-type level), and its phosphatase activity was not comparable with the other tested KdpD proteins (data not shown). Finally, transfer of the phosphoryl group to KdpE was detectable for each KdpD protein carrying an Arg replacement (data not shown). It has been found previously that in wild-type strains kdpFABC is expressed when medium K+ is below 2 mm. Furthermore, an increase in medium osmolarity at constant K+ concentration, a maneuver that reduces turgor, caused expression of kdpFABC(9Laimins L.A. Rhoads D.B. Epstein W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 464-468Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). KdpD proteins, in which Arg residues at positions 503, 506, 508, 511, or 513 were replaced with the neutral amino acid Gln, were tested for their response to an increase in osmolarity and K+limitation in comparison with wild-type KdpD. For this purpose transcriptional induction of kdpFABC was tested withE. coli strain HAK006 (13Sugiura A. Hirokawa K. Nakashima K. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), which harbors akdpFABC promoter-lacZ fusion gene on the chromosome. In response to an increase of osmolarity, high β-galactosidase activities of cells producing wild-type KdpD were detected (Fig. 3 A). Cells producing KdpD-R511Q were characterized by high β-galactosidase activities independent of a stimulus for KdpD (Figs. 3 A and 4 A). In contrast, no increase of β-galactosidase activity depending on the osmolarity of the medium was observed when Arg residues at positions 503, 506, 508, or 513 were replaced with Gln (Fig. 3 A). In cells producing wild-type KdpD kdpFABC expression is prevented when excess KCl is added to the medium (>20 mm) even in the presence of 0.6m NaCl (13Sugiura A. Hirokawa K. Nakashima K. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar).2 However, in case of KdpD-R511QkdpFABC expression was not prevented when the K+concentration in the medium was increased. This effect was observed when cells were cultivated in a medium of high osmolarity caused by NaCl (data not shown) or sucrose (Fig. 4 B).Figure 4KdpFABC expression as determined by β-galactosidase activity depending on an increase of sucrose and KCl. E. coli strain HAK006 was transformed with plasmid pBD (wild-type kdpD) (•), pBD-R511Q (○), pBD-R508Q,R511Q (▪), or pBD-R506Q,R508Q,R511Q (▵). Cells were grown to midlogarithmic growth phase in TY medium (6 mmK+) in the presence of increasing concentrations of sucrose (A) or in the presence of 0.3 m sucrose with increasing concentrations of KCl (B). β-Galactosidase activities were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures” and are given in Miller units (25Miller J.H. A Short Course in Bacterial Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 72-74Google Scholar). The data presented represent average values obtained in at least three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In a second set of experiments we tested the response of these KdpD proteins to K+ limitation in minimal medium. For all KdpD proteins with Arg replacements at positions 503, 506, 508, 511, or 513, high β-galactosidase activities were detectable when cells were grown under K+-limiting conditions (Fig. 3 B). Furthermore, it could be shown for cells producing these proteins with the exception of KdpD-R511Q that β-galactosidase activity declined with increasing K+ in the medium (Fig. 3 B). In the case of KdpD-R511Q, β-galactosidase activity dropped about 2-fold when the K+ concentration was increased from 0.1 to 1 mm. Because replacement of Arg residues at positions 511 or 506 and 508 with Gln caused opposite effects on KdpD activities, we tested the properties of KdpD proteins in which Arg508 and Arg511 or all three Arg residues were replaced simultaneously. In vitro, both proteins are characterized by a shift in the ratio of the kinase to phosphatase activities, which is very similar to the values observed for KdpD-R511Q (data not shown). However, kdpFABC expression pattern is different in comparison with KdpD-R511Q. Simultaneous replacement of Arg residues 508 and 511 or 506, 508, and 511 enabled the corresponding KdpD proteins to respond to K+ (Fig. 4 B) or osmolarity (NaCl) (data not shown). However, these proteins cause elevated kdpFABC expression without external stimuli (Fig. 4). Furthermore, these KdpD proteins became sensitive to an increase in medium osmolarity when sucrose was used (Fig. 4). Under all these conditions constant high β-galactosidase activities were measured in cells producing KdpD-R511Q (Fig. 4). To investigate the importance of the charge at the described positions in KdpD, we replaced each of these Arg residues with Lys and studied the properties of these proteins. Cells producing KdpD-R511K were able to respond to K+ and an increase in medium osmolarity that was comparable with wild-type KdpD; however, a slightly elevated but uninduced level of kdpFABC expression was detectable (Table I). In vitro the ratio of phosphatase to kinase activity of KdpD-R511K was comparable with that of wild-type KdpD (Fig. 5). The amount of KdpD-R513K protein in the membrane (data not shown) and the in vivo and in vitro activities of the latter KdpD derivative are comparable with wild-type KdpD (Table I, Fig. 5). In contrast, substitution of Arg at positions 503, 506, or 508 with Lys in KdpD did not restore wild-type activities. Thus, cells producing these proteins were not able to express kdpFABC in response to an increase of the osmolarity of the medium (Table I); however, they responded to K+limitation. Furthermore, in vitro activities of these proteins reveal that the ratio of kinase to phosphatase activities remained shifted toward a higher phosphatase activity (Fig. 5).Table IInfluence of Arg substitutions at positions 503, 506, 508, 511, or 513 with Lys in KdpD on the regulation of kdpFABC expression by K concentration and osmotic stressKdpD constructβ-Galactosidase activity (units)Minimal mediumTY medium (6 mm K+)TY medium (40 mmK+), 0.6 m NaCl0.1 mmK+1 mm K+No osmotic stress0.6m NaClunitsunitsunitsWild-type KdpD38477501355215KdpD-R503K28151972.5213.8KdpD-R506K1546301.14.12.8KdpD-R508K1760943.4163.8KdpD-R511K303189898172034KdpD-R513K22176301.1862.0E. coli strain HAK006 was transformed with plasmid pBD or its derivatives carrying the indicated mutations in kdpD.

The data presented represent average values obtained in at least three independent experiments. KdpD functions in response to two environmental stimuli, K+ limitation and increase in osmolarity. The mechanism of how KdpD senses these stimuli and how the signal is propagated within the protein is still unclear. McLaughlin and co-workers (28Ben-Tal N. Honig B. Peitzsch R.M. Denisov G. McLaughlin S. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 561-575Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar) studied the binding of basic peptides to acidic lipids in membranes and found that a cluster of at least five Arg or Lys residues with interspersed electrically neutral amino acids within a cytoplasmic protein is sufficient to contribute to its binding to the cytoplasmic membrane. In addition, they found that arginine peptides bind more strongly than lysine peptides. A cluster of Arg residues following the transmembrane domains is found in all known KdpD sequences (Fig. 6). Therefore, we were interested if that cluster is involved in the interaction with negatively charged phospholipids and whether changes of this interaction may be one of the key players in the activation mechanism of KdpD upon stimulus perception. In this communication we investigated this hypothesis by studying the effect of Arg replacements at positions 503, 506, 508, 511, or 513 on the properties of KdpD. We could show that replacements of Arg residues at four positions influence the kinase and phosphatase activities of KdpD. Interestingly, two groups of KdpD proteins emerge from this study. Removal of the positive charge at position 511 leads to the loss of phosphatase activity. On the other hand, KdpD proteins with Arg replacements at positions 503, 506, or 508 are characterized by an increase in the phosphatase activity and a decrease in the kinase activity. Furthermore, when Arg513 was replaced with Gln the amount of KdpD detected in the membrane was drastically reduced. Thus, this substitution does probably not affect the enzymatic activities of KdpD, but rather the insertion and/or stability of the protein in the membrane. The results obtained indicate that these Arg residues are important for the activity of KdpD. However, they do not favor the hypothesis of an interaction of these residues with the acidic phospholipids of the membrane. In the latter case each residue would be expected to contribute to this interaction. This would imply that simultaneous replacement of more than one residue would enhance the effect resulting from one residue. The results with simultaneous replacements of two or three residues presented here strengthen the observation that replacement of Arg residues at different positions results in distinct effects albeit in opposite directions. Therefore, we propose that an electrostatic switch mechanism within the protein exists that regulates the ratio of phosphatase to kinase activity in KdpD. Upon stimulus perception conformational changes lead to changes of electrostatic interactions within the protein, thereby activating or deactivating the signal transduction cascade. The importance of the region between the transmembrane and transmitter domains for signal transduction has already been shown for other sensor kinases, e.g. EnvZ, the sensor kinase involved in regulation of porin gene expression in dependence of the osmolarity of the medium (29Park H. Inouye M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 4382-4390Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), NarX, that is involved in regulation of anaerobic respiratory genes (30Kalman L.V. Gunsalus R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 7049-7056Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or BvgS, the sensor kinase involved in the regulation of expression of Bordetella pertussis virulence regulon (31Miller J.F. Johnson S.A. Black W.J. Beattie D.T. Mekalanos J.J. Falkow S.J. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 970-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Sequence comparison with other sensor kinases revealed that often several positively charged residues follow the transmembrane domains. Therefore, this proposed electrostatic switch mechanism might be of more general importance for sensor kinases. Regulation of activity via a protein domain that has a net positive charge is already well characterized for the Shaker K+ channel. The so called “ball and chain” model has been shown to be suitable to explain the rapid inactivation of voltage-dependent K+channels (32Kondoh S. Ishii K. Nakamura Y. Taira N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19333-19338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 33Hoshi T. Zagotta W.N. Aldrich R.W. Science. 1990; 250: 533-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1265) Google Scholar). The conservative substitution of Arg511 with Lys restores almost wild-type activity. However, replacement of Arg residues at positions 503, 506, or 508 with Lys causes still a shift toward a higher phosphatase activity. These data are difficult to explain with the proposed electrostatic switch mechanism. However, changes in the size of the amino acid side chain at these positions might be responsible for the observed effects. In different studies from our laboratory we could show that the conformation of KdpD is very sensitive to amino acid replacements. Thus, different amino acids at position 409 of KdpD influence the function of the sensor in different directions (27Jung K. Heermann R. Meyer M. Altendorf K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1372: 311-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we found recently that the replacement of a Glu residue with Asp causes dramatic changes in the sensor properties of KdpD.1 In analyzing KdpD proteins with Arg replacements, differences in the response to an increase in osmolarity or K+ limitation have been found. Whereas KdpD proteins with Arg replacements at positions 503, 506, or 508 were unable to respond to an increase in osmolarity, they were still able to sense K+ limitation. As described above, Mizuno (13Sugiura A. Hirokawa K. Nakashima K. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and co-workers isolated mutants that were unable to respond to K+ but became more sensitive to changes in osmolarity. Enzymatic activities of these KdpD variants in vitro were, however, not determined (13Sugiura A. Hirokawa K. Nakashima K. Mizuno T. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 14: 929-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this regard it is interesting to note that KdpD-R508Q,R511Q or KdpD-R506Q,R508Q,R511Q are characterized by a decrease in the phosphatase activity, indicating the dominance of the Arg511 replacement. However, cells producing these proteins do not exhibit constitutive kdpFABCexpression as in the case of KdpD-R511Q, rather the expression was found to be dependent on K+. Interestingly,kdpFABC expression increased when the osmolarity of the medium was raised by the addition of sucrose, which is not the case with wild-type KdpD. Overall, these results indicate that there is to some extent a correlation between the enzymatic activities of KdpD and kdpFABC expression. However, the osmosensing and K+-sensing capabilities of KdpD seem to be distinct processes. In summary, the data presented here indicate that the positively charged residues located close to transmembrane domain TM4 contribute to the activation and deactivation of the signal transduction cascade of the sensor kinase/response regulator system KdpD/KdpE. These data support a working model, in which an electrostatic switch mechanism within the protein is envisaged involving this cluster of charged residues. In addition, these data reveal that KdpD can be activated by two distinct stimuli, K+ limitation and osmolarity.

https://openalex.org/W2063973314,"The role of specific mismatch repair (MMR) gene products was examined by observing several phenotypic end points in two MMR-deficient human endometrial carcinoma cell lines that were originally isolated from the same tumor. The first cell line, HEC-1-A, contains a nonsense mutation in the hPMS2 gene, which results in premature termination and a truncated hPMS2 protein. In addition, HEC-1-A cells carry a splice mutation in thehMSH6 gene and lack wild-type hMSH6 protein. The second cell line, HEC-1-B, possesses the same defective hMSH6locus. However, HEC-1-B cells are heterozygous at the hPMS2locus; that is, along with carrying the same nonsense mutation in hPMS2 as in HEC-1-A, HEC-1-B cells also contain a wild-type hPMS2 gene. Initial recognition of mismatches in DNA requires either the hMSH2/hMSH6 or hMSH2/hMSH3 heterodimer, with hPMS2 functioning downstream of damage recognition. Therefore, cells defective in hPMS2 should completely lack MMR (HEC-1-A), whereas cells mutant in hMSH6 only (HEC-1-B) can potentially repair damage via the hMSH2/hMSH3 heterodimer. The data presented here in HEC-1-B cells illustrate (i) the reduction of instability at microsatellite sequences, (ii) a significant decrease in frameshift mutation rate at HPRT, and (iii) the in vitro repair of looped substrates, relative to HEC-1-A cells, illustrating the repair of frameshift intermediates by hMSH2/hMSH3 heterodimer. Furthermore, the role of hMSH2/hMSH3 heterodimer in the repair of base:base mismatches is supported by observing the reduction in base substitution mutation rate at HPRT in HEC-1-B cells (hMSH6-defective but possessing wild-type hPMS2), as compared with HEC-1-A (hMSH6/hPMS2-defective) cells. These data support a critical role for hPMS2 in human MMR, while further defining the role of the hMSH2/hMSH3 heterodimer in maintaining genomic stability in the absence of a wild-type hMSH2/hMSH6 heterodimer."

The three-dimensional structure of DNA plays a key role in many biological processes. Reactions such as replication, transcription, or recombination not only are regulated by but also have a profound effect on the topology of the DNA molecule. The enzymes responsible for maintaining the topological state of DNA are DNA topoisomerases. One such enzyme is DNA gyrase, a bacterial topoisomerase that introduces negative supercoils into DNA in a reaction coupled to ATP hydrolysis. The action of gyrase involves the creation of a double-stranded break in one DNA segment and the passage of another segment through this enzyme-stabilized DNA gate. The ability of gyrase to negatively supercoil DNA is unique among topoisomerases and is based on its mode of DNA binding (1Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gyrase wraps DNA in a right-handed manner (1Liu L.F. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 2098-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), resulting in the positioning of two segments of DNA in the right orientation for supercoiling. Binding of ATP closes a protein clamp that traps the DNA segment to be transported. The nucleotide is then hydrolyzed, and the free energy is coupled to the supercoiling reaction. After hydrolysis, the enzyme is reset for another round of supercoiling. The limit of supercoiling is believed to be thermodynamic rather than steric, because gyrase can supercoil very small DNA circles, whereas a nucleotide analog (ATPαS)1 with higher free energy of hydrolysis than ATP is capable of taking the limit of the supercoiling reaction to higher negative superhelical density (3Bates A.D. Maxwell A. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1861-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,4Cullis P.M. Maxwell A. Weiner D.P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9642-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Gyrase is a heterotetramer in which two A (GyrA, 97 kDa) and two B (GyrB, 90 kDa) subunits constitute an A2B2complex (5Reece R.J. Maxwell A. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 26: 335-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). There is one ATP-binding site per GyrB, which is situated in the 43-kDa N-terminal domain of the protein. The structure of this domain complexed with the ATP analog 5′-adenylyl-β,γ-imidodiphosphate (ADPNP) was solved by x-ray crystallography and was found to be a dimer (6Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Study of the ATPase reaction of this domain revealed that dimerization is an essential step for ATP hydrolysis (7Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). It is very likely that dimerization of the 43-kDa domain also occurs in the ATPase reaction of intact gyrase (8Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22606-22614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The rate of ATP hydrolysis by gyrase is stimulated by the presence of DNA (9Maxwell A. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14472-14480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the kinetics of hydrolysis show positive cooperativity between the two ATP-binding sites (10Maxwell A. Rau D.C.

Adenine Press, 1986: 137-146Google Scholar, 11Tamura J.K. Bates A.D. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9214-9222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22615-22626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A number of issues concerning the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis are still unclear. These include the mechanism of cooperativity between the two sites and the coupling of the free energy produced by these two reactions to a strand passage event. Directly related to these issues is the question of whether ATP hydrolysis can take place only in one of the two sites and the capacity of such a reaction to support supercoiling. At the molecular level the mechanism of hydrolysis of ATP by gyrase involves nucleophilic attack by water on theγ-phosphate of ATP with Glu42 of GyrB acting as a general base (13Jackson A.P. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11232-11236Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mutation of Glu42 to Ala in GyrB abolishes ATP hydrolysis but not nucleotide binding (13Jackson A.P. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11232-11236Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We formed heterogeneous gyrase tetramers containing one wild-type and one mutant GyrBAla42 subunit and used these complexes to address the above questions. Wild-type GyrA and GyrB proteins were prepared as described previously (14Maxwell A. Howells A.J. Bjornsti M.-A. Osheroff N. Protocols for DNA Topoisomerases I: DNA Topology and Enzyme Purification. Humana Press, 1998: 135-144Google Scholar). Mutant GyrBAla42 or GyrBGln42 proteins were a gift of Dr. A. P. Jackson and were made as described previously (13Jackson A.P. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11232-11236Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Relaxed and supercoiled forms of pBR322 DNA were gifts of A. J. Howells (Leicester University), whereas linear pBR322 was made by digestion of the supercoiled form by EcoRI. Limited proteolysis experiments were performed as described previously (8Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22606-22614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). ATPase assays were performed as described previously (7Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 15Hammonds T.R. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32696-32703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), in 35 mm Tris·HCl (pH 7.5), 24 mm KCl, 4 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 6.5% w/v glycerol, 2 mm ATP at 25 °C. The extent of supercoiling was determined by removing samples from the ATPase reactions and analyzing them by agarose gel electrophoresis. Heterogeneous tetramers were formed by mixing the indicated amounts of wild-type and mutant GyrB proteins and allowing the mixture to equilibrate at 25 °C for 1 h. GyrA was then added in excess of the total B protein, and the gyrase complexes were allowed to form for 1 h at 25 °C. After DNA was added (where indicated), reactions were incubated at 25 °C for a further 30 min. 2 mm ATP was then added to initiate the reactions. Limited proteolysis has been used as a sensitive probe for detecting conformational changes in DNA topoisomerases (8Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22606-22614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 16Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 749-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Treatment of gyrase with trypsin produces two major fragments, one of ∼62 kDa, derived from the A protein, and another of ∼25 kDa from the B protein (Fig. 1); this proteolytic fingerprint has been termed complex I (8Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22606-22614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Binding of ADPNP induces dimerization of the B subunits resulting in a conformation that protects the 43-kDa domains of GyrB from tryptic digestion. The characteristic fingerprint of this conformation (termed complex II) consists, apart from the two above mentioned fragments, of another two bands, corresponding to the 43-kDa domain and a 33-kDa fragment of this domain (Fig. 1 and Ref. 8Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22606-22614Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). ATP cannot trap the wild-type enzyme in this conformation because hydrolysis resets the enzyme to its native form (Fig. 1). We probed the A2B2Ala42 complex using limited proteolysis to determine the state of the ATP-operated clamp in the presence of ATP or ADPNP. The characteristic complex II signature was apparent after treatment with trypsin in the presence of both nucleotides (Fig. 1). These results suggest that upon incubation of the A2B2Ala42 complex with ATP, the nucleotide binds to the enzyme and induces dimerization of the B subunits but due to the inability of this complex to hydrolyze the nucleotide, it becomes trapped in the dimerized conformation (complex II). We addressed the possibility of ATP hydrolysis occurring only at one of the two ATP-binding sites in the case where both sites are occupied by the nucleotide. To achieve this we formed heterotetramers of gyrase that contained, apart from the two GyrA protomers, one wild-type GyrB subunit and one mutant GyrBAla42 subunit. Such complexes can be formed by reconstituting the gyrase heterotetramer in the presence of both wild-type and mutant GyrB proteins (17O'Dea M.H. Tamura J.K. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9723-9729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Electron microscopy and cross-linking studies have failed to detect any dimeric forms of GyrB in the absence of GyrA, suggesting that a significant proportion of GyrB is monomeric in solution (18Kirchhausen T. Wang J.C. Harrison S.C. Cell. 1985; 41: 933-943Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 19Klevan L. Wang J. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 5229-5234Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Therefore, we expect that by allowing a mixture of the wild-type and mutant GyrB proteins to equilibrate and then adding GyrA, a random distribution of gyrase complexes containing two wild-type, two mutant, or one of each kind of GyrB proteins would be produced. Indeed, in similar experiments, O'Dea and co-workers (17O'Dea M.H. Tamura J.K. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9723-9729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) found no bias for the formation of any particular one of the above complexes. It is unlikely that heterogeneous tetramers could be studied separately due to the uncertainties concerning the stability of the gyrase tetramer (i.e. such an isolated population would probably re-equilibrate to a mixture of heterogeneous and homogeneous tetramers). Therefore, we decided to study the behavior of complexes formed at different ratios of wild-type to mutant subunit and analyze the results obtained in terms of the predicted population of each tetrameric species, assuming random association. We tested the ability of heterogeneous tetramers to hydrolyze ATP. Mixtures containing varying amounts of homogeneous and heterogeneous tetramers were formed by mixing a constant concentration of the wild-type subunit with increasing concentrations of the mutant protein (up to a 12-fold excess). GyrA was always in excess of the total B protein, and the ATPase reactions of both the DNA-free enzyme and the gyrase-DNA complex were studied. Increasing concentrations of the mutant protein resulted in inhibition of the rate of hydrolysis (Fig. 2). However, this inhibition was not full, and, in the case of the gyrase-DNA complex, the ATPase rate seemed to plateau at approximately 40% of the rate exhibited by the sample containing only wild-type enzyme-DNA complex. In the absence of DNA, increasing concentrations of the mutant resulted in a decrease in the rate of hydrolysis that levelled out at ∼65% of the rate of the reaction containing only the DNA-free wild-type enzyme (Fig. 2). The ATPase rates observed were specific to the gyrase complexes and not due to any contamination, because they were completely inhibited by the addition of novobiocin to the reaction. We calculated the amount of tetramers with two wild-type subunits at the concentrations of wild-type and mutant protein used in these experiments and were able to estimate the theoretical rate of hydrolysis in the case where the only complexes that were able to hydrolyze the nucleotide were those that contained two wild-type B subunits (see the Appendix). The theoretical curve representing this situation is shown in Fig. 2. The deviation of the experimental data from this theoretical curve is clear. These results suggest that ATP can be hydrolyzed independently only at one site but that the rate of hydrolysis is lower than when both sites are capable of undergoing this reaction. The turnover number of the wild-type enzyme, in the absence of DNA, was measured to bek BB−DNA = 0.12 s−1. By estimating the concentration of the different species in the above mixtures, the turnover number exhibited by the heterogeneous complexes can be determined. The equation that relates the observed rate of hydrolysis to the concentration of the wild-type and mutant proteins, in terms of the turnover numbers of the wild-type enzyme and the heterogeneous tetramer, is shown in the Appendix. By fitting the experimental data to Equation 5 (see the Appendix) the turnover number of the heterogeneous complex was determined to bek BB*−DNA = 0.04 s−1. In the presence of DNA, the wild-type enzyme was measured to hydrolyze the nucleotide with a turnover number of k BB+DNA = 1.06 s−1, compared with an estimated k BB*+DNA= 0.18 s−1 in the case of the heterogeneous tetramer-DNA complex. In another experiment, mixtures of tetramers were formed where the total concentration of GyrB protein (wild type and mutant) was kept constant while the ratio of the wild-type to mutant subunit was varied from 100% GyrBAla42 to 100% wild-type GyrB. The rate of hydrolysis for both the enzyme-DNA and the DNA-free complexes was measured; the results obtained from this experiment were plotted together with two theoretical curves (Fig. 3 A). One of these curves describes the situation where heterogeneous tetramers cannot hydrolyze ATP (complete inhibition), and the other shows the situation where wild-type GyrB subunits can hydrolyze the nucleotide at the same rate irrespective of them being part of heterogeneous or homogeneous tetramers (no inhibition). The experimental data fall between those two lines. The rate of the enzyme-DNA complex is the one affected more by the formation of the heterogeneous tetramer and is closer to the curve describing complete inhibition, whereas the rate of the DNA-free complex is affected less and is closer to the theoretical curve of no inhibition, consistent with the results in Fig. 2. By fitting these results to Equation 6, the turnover number of the heterogeneous complexes can be determined. The values obtained in this experiment (k BB*−DNA = 0.03 s−1for the DNA-free complex and k BB*+DNA = 0.20 s−1 for the DNA-bound one) are in very good agreement with those determined in the experiment described in Fig. 2, giving an average of k BB*−DNA = 0.035 s−1and k BB*+DNA = 0.19 s−1for the two experiments. To test the ability of heterogeneous complexes to support supercoiling, samples were removed from the above ATPase reactions at regular intervals, and the extent of supercoiling was determined (Fig. 3 B; the reactions were performed in the presence of relaxed pBR322 DNA and in the absence of spermidine). The wild-type A2B2 complex produced a distribution of topoisomers that had a center that differed from the center of the distribution of the relaxed substrate by a linking number (ΔLk) of 20. The limit of supercoiling lowered gradually as the ratio of mutant to wild-type increased. At 90% GyrBAla42 the center of the distribution had a ΔLk of 17 (Fig. 3 B). At 100% GyrBAla42 supercoiling was virtually abolished (the limited amount of supercoiling observed in this case is probably due to low levels of contamination of the GyrA preparation with wild-type GyrB and does not affect the results of this experiment). The levels of supercoiling observed in the case of the 90% mixture was not due to the low levels of wild-type A2B2 complexes present in the reaction (1%). This was confirmed by directly comparing the level of supercoiling supported from the heterogeneous mixture to that supported by an amount of wild-type enzyme equal to the predicted concentration of wild-type complexes in this mixture. In this experiment, at the time when the heterogeneous mixture had reached the limit of the supercoiling reaction, the wild-type enzyme had been unable to support significant levels of supercoiling (data not shown). This extent of supercoiling is due to a catalytic reaction, because the levels of enzyme used are not sufficient to ascribe this result to a stoichiometric reaction. It appears from these results that heterogeneous tetramers have not lost their ability to supercoil DNA but that the limit of this reaction is lower. The experiments reported here with GyrBAla42 were also performed with the GyrBGln42 mutant, which also binds but does not hydrolyze ATP (13Jackson A.P. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11232-11236Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), yielding similar results (data not shown). The A2B2Ala42 complex is unable to hydrolyze ATP (13Jackson A.P. Maxwell A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11232-11236Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and this is manifested by the trapping of this protein in the dimerized conformation (complex II) in the presence of the nucleotide (Fig. 1). This result also reveals that the complex II-characteristic proteolytic signature is not an attribute of the particular complex formed with ADPNP but reflects the conformation of the catalytic intermediate formed in the presence of ATP. Thus, the structure of complex II formed with ATP or ADPNP is indistinguishable, at least at the level detectable by limited proteolysis. The mechanism of ATP hydrolysis by DNA gyrase can be summarized in the scheme shown in Fig. 4. The central point in this mechanism is the dimerization of the B subunits (formation of complex II). ATP binds to the monomerized subunits within the A2B2 complex, and dimerization has to occur before hydrolysis can take place (7Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Binding of ATP in only one of the two subunits is sufficient for dimerization (16Lindsley J.E. Wang J.C. Nature. 1993; 361: 749-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 20Ali J.A. Orphanides G. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9801-9808Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Although, once the clamp is in the dimerized form, binding of a second ATP molecule appears not to be possible (6Wigley D.B. Davies G.J. Dodson E.J. Maxwell A. Dodson G. Nature. 1991; 351: 624-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar), no direct experimental evidence exists on this issue. It has recently been reported that when ATP binding at one of the two sites was abolished, gyrase could not perform catalytic supercoiling (17O'Dea M.H. Tamura J.K. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9723-9729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear whether this is because the complex with one ATP has poor or no ATPase activity or whether hydrolysis in this case is uncoupled from strand passage. Nevertheless, with wild-type enzyme, occupation of the two ATP-binding sites is cooperative; therefore the complex with two ATP molecules bound should be the predominant species at high ATP concentrations (10Maxwell A. Rau D.C. Gellert M. Sarma R.H. Sarma M.H. Biomolecular Stereodynamics III: Proceedings of the Fourth Conversation in the Discipline of Biomolecular Stereodynamics. Adenine Press, 1986: 137-146Google Scholar, 11Tamura J.K. Bates A.D. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9214-9222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kampranis S.C. Maxwell A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22615-22626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Moreover, experiments with the 43-kDa domain of gyrase showed that dimerization of two ATP-bound domains is favored over dimerization of one bound and one free domain by 2 orders of magnitude (20Ali J.A. Orphanides G. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9801-9808Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). ADP does not stabilize the dimerized form (7Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar), resulting in the monomerization of the subunits after hydrolysis (Fig. 4). Hydrolysis in the doubly occupied complex comprises two hydrolysis reactions. In the experiments described in this paper, we set out to address the issue of interdependence between these two hydrolysis events and their coupling to strand passage. We found that complexes containing only one ATPase-proficient GyrB subunit hydrolyze the nucleotide at a lower rate than the wild-type enzyme. The pathway that describes reactivity at one of the two sites is shown in the upper shaded part of Fig. 4. The spectrophotometric assay used in these experiments for determining the rate of hydrolysis measures changes in the concentration of free ADP; therefore the rate of the actual hydrolysis reaction cannot be measured separately from that of the monomerization and product release steps. However, experiments with the 43-kDa domain of GyrB suggested that the rate-limiting step in the mechanism of ATP hydrolysis by gyrase is either a conformational change associated with monomerization or product release (7Ali J.A. Jackson A.P. Howells A.J. Maxwell A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2717-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Thus, due to the two ATP molecules hydrolyzed per round, the apparent rate constant of the monomerization/product release step in the wild-type complex can be determined to bek wtapp =k BB+DNA/2 = 0.53 s−1. In the case of the heterogeneous tetramer, the mutant site would contain the unhydrolyzed nucleotide after hydrolysis on the other site had occurred. This would likely result in stabilization of the dimerized form, inhibiting the rate of the monomerization/product release step. Therefore, in the heterogeneous tetramer-DNA complex, the rate-limiting step slows down tok happ =k BB*+DNA = 0.19 s−1(note that only one ATP is hydrolyzed per heterogeneous tetramer). In the absence of DNA, gyrase exhibits a much lower turnover number,k BB−DNA = 0.12 s−1 in our experiments. This is because binding of gyrase to DNA stimulates the ATPase activity of the enzyme (9Maxwell A. Gellert M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14472-14480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is not yet clear what is the rate-limiting step in the reaction of the DNA-free complex. If monomerization or product release is again the rate-limiting step, then the results obtained here with the heterogeneous tetramer could be explained in terms of the inhibition of the monomerization/product release step by the bound nucleotide. If this is the case, DNA binding should stimulate the ATPase activity by accelerating the monomerization/product release part of the mechanism. However, it is possible that in the absence of DNA, the rate-limiting step is the actual hydrolysis reaction. DNA binding would stimulate the rate of this step, thus making monomerization/product release rate-limiting in the enzyme-DNA complex. The limit of the supercoiling reaction in the presence of the heterogeneous tetramers was ΔLk 17 in contrast with ΔLk 20 observed in the case of wild-type gyrase. The value of ΔLk 20 is in good agreement with that determined previously for the limit of supercoiling in the absence of spermidine (21Westerhoff H.V. O'Dea M.H. Maxwell A. Gellert M. Cell Biophys. 1988; 12: 157-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Assuming that the limit of the supercoiling reaction is directly related to the free energy of ATP hydrolysis (4Cullis P.M. Maxwell A. Weiner D.P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9642-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the lower absolute superhelical density reached in the case of the heterogeneous complex should reflect the reduction in the free energy released when only one ATP is hydrolyzed. However, the free energy released by the extra ATP molecule does not reflect the difference in the free energy of the products, if this is determined according to the relationship described by Cullis et al. (4Cullis P.M. Maxwell A. Weiner D.P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 9642-9646Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In other work, the dependence of the limit of supercoiling on the free energy of ATP hydrolysis was studied by varying the ratio of [ATP]/[ADP] present in the reaction while keeping the total concentration of nucleotides constant (21Westerhoff H.V. O'Dea M.H. Maxwell A. Gellert M. Cell Biophys. 1988; 12: 157-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). These data suggested that, especially in the absence of spermidine, the relationship between linking number change and phosphate potential is not proportional, due to significant ATPase slip and ATP-independent DNA relaxation (21Westerhoff H.V. O'Dea M.H. Maxwell A. Gellert M. Cell Biophys. 1988; 12: 157-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We believe that the results obtained here reflect a complicated equilibrium established between the ATP-dependent supercoiling and ATP-independent relaxation reactions of the wild-type and heterogeneous complexes. Therefore, making any correlation between the limit of supercoiling and the free energy of ATP hydrolysis is beyond the capacity of these experiments. In conclusion, we found that gyrase can hydrolyze ATP at one active site and can supercoil DNA even with only one ATP hydrolyzed at a time. Although this reaction is unlikely to occur in vivo, due to the physiological ATP concentration being relatively high, the results obtained here provide us with useful information on the mechanism of energy coupling in DNA gyrase. We thank Mary O'Dea, Janid Ali, and Andy Bates for reading the manuscript and Andy Jackson and Ali Howells for gifts of enzyme and DNA. If [B] is the concentration of wild-type and [B*] is the concentration of the mutant GyrB protein, then the total concentration of B protein in a mixture of the above two will be:[B]tot=[B]+[B*](Eq. 1) Considering random mixing of the two GyrB proteins and an excess of GyrA over [B]tot, the concentrations of the various species of heterotetramer formed would be:[A2B2]=[B]22[B]tot [A2BB*]=[B]([B]tot−[B])[B]tot (Eq. 2) [A2B*2]=([B]tot−[B])22[B]totThe rate of hydrolysis v = d[ADP]/dtexhibited by one such mixture would be the sum of the rates exhibited by the A2B2 and A2BB* complexes (A2B*2 does not hydrolyze the nucleotide):v=vBB+vBB*(Eq. 3) If k BB (= v BB/[A2B2]) is the turnover number of the wild-type complex (A2B2) and k BB* (= v BB* /[A2BB*]) is the turnover number of the mutant complex (A2BB*), then by combining the above equations, we can estimate the rate of hydrolysis in terms of the starting concentrations of the wild-type and mutant proteins. Thus,v=(kBB−2kBB*)[B]22[B]tot+[B]kBB*(Eq. 4) In the experiments described in Fig. 2, the concentration of wild-type GyrB, [B], is kept constant while titrating mutant GyrBAla42 protein. In these experiments the concentrations of wild-type and mutant GyrBs are expressed on a monomer basis. In this case the rate exhibited by the wild-type complex in the absence of any mutant protein is v wt =k BB[B]/2. The ratio of the rate exhibited by the heterogeneous mixture (v) to the rate exhibited by the sample containing only wild-type (v wt) can be expressed in terms of the ratio of the concentration of mutant to the concentration of wild-type protein present in the reaction ([B*]/[B]):vvwt=1+2kBB*kBB[B*][B][B*][B]+1(Eq. 5) In the experiment described in Fig. 3, the total concentration of B protein, [B]tot, is constant, whereas the ratio of wild-type to mutant subunit is varied. In this case, the rate exhibited by the sample containing only the wild-type complex isv wt =k BB[B]tot/2, because in this particular sample [B] = [B]tot. From this and Equation 4 the ratio v/v wt can be written in terms of the ratio of the concentration of the wild-type subunit to the total concentration of B protein ([B]/[B]tot),vvwt=1−2kBB*kBB[B][B]tot2+2kBB*kBB[B][B]tot(Eq. 6) The theoretical lines describing the situations of complete inhibition or no inhibition can be derived from the above equations by substituting k BB* by 0 ork BB/2, respectively."
https://openalex.org/W2010553820,"CTCF is a multifunctional transcription factor encoded by a novel candidate tumor suppressor gene (Filippova, G. N., Lindblom, A., Meinke, L. J., Klenova, E. M., Neiman, P. E., Collins, S. J., Doggett, N. D., and Lobanenkov, V. V. (1998) Genes Chromosomes Cancer 22, 26–36). We characterized genomic organization of the chicken CTCF(chCTCF) gene, and studied the chCTCF promoter. Genomic locus of chCTCF contains a GC-rich untranslated exon separated from seven coding exons by a long intron. The 2-kilobase pair region upstream of the major transcription start site contains a CpG island marked by a “Not-knot” that includes sequence motifs characteristic of a TATA-less promoter of housekeeping genes. When fused upstream of a reporter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, it acts as a strong transcriptional promoter in transient transfection experiments. The minimal 180-base pair chCTCF promoter region that is fully sufficient to confer high level transcriptional activity to the reporter contains high affinity binding element for the transcription factor YY1. This element is strictly conserved in chicken, mouse, and human CTCF genes. Mutations in the core nucleotides of the YY1 element reduce transcriptional activity of the minimal chCTCF promoter, indicating that the conserved YY1-binding sequence is critical for transcriptional regulation of vertebrate CTCF genes. We also noted in thechCTCF promoter several elements previously characterized in cell cycle-regulated genes, including the “cell cycle-dependent element” and “cell cycle gene homology region” motifs shown to be important for S/G2-specific up-regulation of cdc25C, cdc2, cyclin A, and Plk (polo-like kinase) gene promoters. Presence of the cell cycle-dependent element/cell cycle gene homology region element suggested that chCTCFexpression may be cell cycle-regulated. We show that both levels of the endogenous chCTCF mRNA, and the activity of the stably transfected chCTCF promoter constructs, increase in S/G2 cells. CTCF is a multifunctional transcription factor encoded by a novel candidate tumor suppressor gene (Filippova, G. N., Lindblom, A., Meinke, L. J., Klenova, E. M., Neiman, P. E., Collins, S. J., Doggett, N. D., and Lobanenkov, V. V. (1998) Genes Chromosomes Cancer 22, 26–36). We characterized genomic organization of the chicken CTCF(chCTCF) gene, and studied the chCTCF promoter. Genomic locus of chCTCF contains a GC-rich untranslated exon separated from seven coding exons by a long intron. The 2-kilobase pair region upstream of the major transcription start site contains a CpG island marked by a “Not-knot” that includes sequence motifs characteristic of a TATA-less promoter of housekeeping genes. When fused upstream of a reporter chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, it acts as a strong transcriptional promoter in transient transfection experiments. The minimal 180-base pair chCTCF promoter region that is fully sufficient to confer high level transcriptional activity to the reporter contains high affinity binding element for the transcription factor YY1. This element is strictly conserved in chicken, mouse, and human CTCF genes. Mutations in the core nucleotides of the YY1 element reduce transcriptional activity of the minimal chCTCF promoter, indicating that the conserved YY1-binding sequence is critical for transcriptional regulation of vertebrate CTCF genes. We also noted in thechCTCF promoter several elements previously characterized in cell cycle-regulated genes, including the “cell cycle-dependent element” and “cell cycle gene homology region” motifs shown to be important for S/G2-specific up-regulation of cdc25C, cdc2, cyclin A, and Plk (polo-like kinase) gene promoters.

The human CTCF gene maps within one of the smallest regions of overlap for chromosome deletions, which are displayed by a variety of different tumors including breast and prostate cancers (6Filippova G.N. Lindblom A. Meinke L.J. Klenova E.M. Neiman P.E. Collins S.J. Doggett N.D. Lobanenkov V.V. Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 1998; 22: 26-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), and tumor-specific rearrangements of the human CTCF gene have been detected in some primary breast cancer patients (6Filippova G.N.

Thus,CTCF is potentially an important tumor suppressor gene involved in the pathogenesis of a number of human cancers. To better understand a mechanism by which CTCF gene expression is regulated, and may contribute to cell proliferation and transformation, we isolated the entire genomic locus and characterized exon-intron organization of the chicken CTCF(chCTCF) gene. We also studied the 5′ non-coding region of the gene, mapped transcription start sites, and delineated thechCTCF minimal promoter driven by the strictly conserved initiator (Inr)-like element identical to several previously characterized high affinity binding site for the YY1 transcriptional factor. A computer-assisted inspection of the chCTCFpromoter DNA sequence revealed the “cell cycle-dependent element” (CDE) and “cell cycle gene homology region” (CHR) motifs shared by promoters of several cell cycle-regulated genes and found to be important for specific up-regulation at late S and G2stages of the cell cycle (7Zwicker J.

We show here that both abundance of the endogenous chCTCF mRNA, and the activity of the stably transfected reporter constructs containingchCTCF promoter, are increased in S/G2cells. A chicken genomic DNA library, constructed by cloning in Lambda DASHTM II of genomic DNA fragments obtained by Sau3A partial digest, was obtained from A. Begue and V. Laudet (11Amouyel P. Laudet V. Martin P. Li R. Quatannens B. Staehelin D. Saule S. J. Virol. 1989; 63: 3382-3388Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The library was screened with the probes either harboring the most 5′-distal 60-bpNotI-NotI fragment, or containing the open reading frame and 3′-untranslated sequence (3′-UTR) of thechCTCF cDNA (4Klenova E.M. Nicolas R.H. Paterson H.F. Carne A.F. Heath C.M. Goodwin G.H. Neiman P.E Lobanenkov V.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7612-7624Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The probes were 32P-labeled according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer of the random priming kit (Stratagene). Four overlapping positive λ clones, L2, NN2, L18, and L11 (Fig. 1), were isolated by separate screening with the two probes. Phage DNA was purified as described by Sambrooket al. (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Phage DNAs were cut with XbaI,EcoRI, KpnI, BamHI, XhoI, and BglII; separated on 0.8% agarose gel; transferred onto the Hybond nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech); and analyzed by consecutive hybridization with DNA fragments corresponding to the 5′-untranslated, coding and 3′-untranslated regions of thechCTCF cDNA (4Klenova E.M.

The XbaI-produced DNA fragments from all positive phage clones were subcloned into Bluescript II SK+ and partially sequenced, while theSmaI-produced DNA fragments derived from the 5′-untranslated region were completely sequenced on both strands. Due to segments with extreme GC content, DNA sequencing was performed manually by the dideoxy chain termination procedure with T7 DNA polymerase and [α-35S]dATP (both from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (13Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Bio/Technology. 1992; 24: 104-108PubMed Google Scholar). Each exon-intron boundary was determined by comparing the cDNA and genomic sequences. Intron sizes were defined by measuring the size of representative restriction fragments and/or of the polymerase chain reaction-amplified DNA products spanning introns. Total cellular RNA was prepared from the chicken myeloid cell line BM2 (14Moscovici C. Zeller N. Moscovici M.G. Revoltella R.F. Pontieri G.M. Basiliico C. Rovera G. Gallo R.C. Subak-Sharpe J.H.

Biochem. 1988; 162: 156-159Crossref Scopus (63145) Google Scholar). Primer extension analysis was performed by the procedure described previously (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) with three synthetic 5′-end-labeled antisense primers complementary to segments of the chCTCF mRNA sequence shown in Fig. 3. The primer-extended products were resolved on 8% polyacrylamide-urea sequencing gels. The longest CAT reporter construct that we prepared, the pPN/CAT containing 2180 bp of the chCTCF 5′-flanking DNA extending in 5′-direction from the NheI site at the +1 position to thePstI site (Fig. 3), was constructed by ligating thePstI-NheI fragment from the NN2 genomic λ clone (Fig. 1) to the CAT-encoding region of the pBLCAT3 plasmid (17Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) as schematically shown in Fig. 4 A. Truncated promoter versions of the reporters were prepared by subsequently deleting from the pPN/CAT plasmid of four DNA fragments beginning at the same upstreamPstI site and extending downstream to HindIII (pHN/CAT), BstXI (pBN/CAT), ApaI (pAN/CAT), and SphI (pSN/CAT) sites shown in Fig. 3. Site-specific mutagenesis in the pSN/CAT plasmid to change the GCCATTT sequence at −60 position to the atggTTT sequence where mutated bases are underlined (Fig. 3) was carried out with the Quik Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The presence of the correctly mutated site in the resulting pSN-YY1mut/CAT plasmid was ascertained by DNA sequencing. The promoterless plasmid pBLCAT3 (17Luckow B. Schutz G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) was employed to determine nonspecific background CAT signal. The reporter constructs were transfected with the Lipofectin reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to protocol A of Felgner and Holm (18Felgner P.L. Gadek T.R. Holm M. Roman R. Chan H.W.

Geballe A.P. Virology. 1991; 183: 381-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Four identical transfections for each reporter were performed to ensure reliability of results by better assessing experimental deviations, and 48 h after transfection the CAT activity normalized to the β-galactosidase activity was determined by a phase-extraction CAT assay as described earlier (20Seed B. Sheen J.-Y. Gene (Amst.). 1988; 67: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar). To obtain stably transfected NIH3T3 cells, the CAT reporters and the pEQ222 construct were co-transfected with the pSV2Neo as described above, and selection of G418-resistant clones and establishing of polyclonal mass cultures performed as described previously (1Filippova G.N.

Lopata M.A. MacDonald R.J. Cowan N.J. Rutter W.J. Kirschner M.W. Cell. 1980; 20: 95-105Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar) as an internal control to normalize levels of chCTCF and H2b mRNAs. Four overlapping λ clones containing the entire chCTCF genomic locus were isolated from a screen of ∼106 recombinants by hybridization to the two regions of the chCTCF cDNA as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Southern blot hybridization mapping with probes derived from different regions of thechCTCF cDNA (data not shown) demonstrated that two clones (L18 and L11; Fig. 1 C) contain all coding exons and the 3′-flanking region, while two other clones harbor the 5′-non-coding region of the gene (L2 and NN2; Fig. 1 C). Four clones together represent approximately 35 kb of the chCTCF genomic locus. Restriction fragment mapping of each phage and various subclones, combined with sequencing genomic DNAs in both directions from the known DNA sequence of the cDNA revealed junctions at each exon-intron boundary. Finally, measuring of the intron sizes allowed us to define the complete organization of thechCTCF gene (Fig. 1 A), and to obtain a reasonably detailed restriction map of the locus (Fig. 1 B). It contains 8 chCTCF exons. Exon 1, and exons 3 to 7 are relatively small (each less than 500 bp), whereas exons 2 and 8 are relatively large (797 and 1569 bp, respectively). The long first intron of approximately 15 kb separates coding exons from the first non-coding GC-rich exon. Exon 2 harbors the translation start Met residue, and encodes most of chCTCF amino-terminal domain upstream of the first zinc-finger. Exon 8 contains a small carboxyl-terminal portion of the open reading frame (167 bp) and the entire 3′-UTR of thechCTCF cDNA (1413 bp) with a polyadenylation signal(s). Table I shows that 11 zinc-fingers of CTCF are encoded by exons 3 to 6; exon 3 contains fingers 1 and 2, exon 4 contains fingers 3–5, exon 5 contains finger 6 and a part of the finger 7, and exon 6 contains the rest of finger 7 and fingers 8–11. Nuclear localization signal, CKII target phosphorylation sites, proline-rich sequence with the PXXP-type SH3 domain binding consensus, and an AT-rich DNA-binding domain (“AT hook”) positioned downstream of the 11th zinc-finger (4Klenova E.M.

Table I also summarizes the results of DNA sequence analyses of thechCTCF exon-intron organization. It shows that nucleotide sequences immediately flanking the splice sites are in a good agreement with the consensus splice donor and acceptor sequences (25Senapathy P. Shapiro M.B. Harris N.L. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 183: 252-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). AllchCTCF introns belong to the predominant GT-AG class of introns in vertebrate splicing. To map the chCTCFgene transcription site(s), we employed the primer extension analyses. Total RNA prepared from chicken cell lines BM2 and HD3 was hybridized at different annealing temperatures with the excess of 5′-labeled primer-1 (Fig. 3), and incubated with avian myeloblastosis reverse transcriptase. Extension products were analyzed on sequencing gels (Fig. 2, lanes 1–6). To determine accurately nucleotides at the extension product ends, the same 5′-labeled primer served for four extension and dideoxy chain termination reactions with a genomic DNA subclone as a template to produce cognate sequence ladders (Fig. 2, lanes A, T, G, and C). Fig. 2shows that major specific extension products generated by reverse transcriptase with RNA from two different cell lineages are presented by a doublet band corresponding to the CC dinucleotide betweenNheI and NotI sites. Since avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase can often erroneously produce cDNA with one “extra” nucleotide at the 5′-end of mRNA template (26Gupta K.C. Kingsbury D.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 3829-3841Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), we assigned the major transcription initiation site of thechCTCF to the G residue designated +1 at the coding strand (first G in the NotI site) as depicted in Fig. 3. In BM2 and HD3 cells, initiation at this site generates the bulk of chCTCF mRNAs with 125-nucleotide-long 5′-UTR leader sequence. However, we previously detected (see Ref. 4Klenova E.M. Nicolas R.H. Paterson H.F. Carne A.F. Heath C.M. Goodwin G.H. Neiman P.E Lobanenkov V.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7612-7624Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) longer chCTCF cDNAs with 5′ ends produced by initiation close to the initiator (Inr) element consensus sequence at −60 position (Fig. 3). Therefore, other transcription start site(s) upstream of the major site mapped by the primer-1 extension with RNA from HD3 and BM2 cells (Fig. 2) may also be present, and perhaps be more efficiently employed in different cell types. Indeed, with primers 2 and 3 complementary to mRNA sequences upstream of the +1 (NotI) site (Fig. 3) used for the primer extension assays, other distal transcription start sites could be detected (data not shown). Only the +1 site identified with the primer 1 (Fig. 2) lies close to the transcription initiation site predicted by the TSSG computer algorithm (shown as “predicted TSS” in Fig. 3) that fairly accurately determines potential transcription start positions in a candidate promoter sequence based on the density calculations for transcription factor binding sites (27Solovyev V. Salamov A. ISMB. 1997; 5: 294-302Google Scholar); therefore, we assigned the major +1 position as shown in Fig. 3. We sequenced the 5′-flanking genomic chCTCF DNA region, and inspected this DNA sequence for CpG content and for presence of potential regulatory elements by the Transcription Element Search Software (TESS) (28Schug J. Overton G.C. TESS: Transcription Element Search Software on the WWW; Technical Report CBIL-TR-1997-1001-v0.0 of the Computational Biology and Informatics Laboratory. University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia1997Google Scholar) that locates and displays binding sites for transcriptional factors presented in the TransFac data base version 3.2. Fig. 3 demonstrates that neither a TATA box nor a CAAT box is present at expected characteristic positions relative to the +1, although farther upstream potential binding sites for CCAAT-binding protein(s) (at −1383) and several TATA elements (for example, at −560) were noted. Lack of the TATA- and CAAT- box elements is a common feature for many GC-rich promoters, which direct transcription via the Inr element that conforms to the consensus sequence Py-Py-A+1-N-(T/A)-Py-Py (29Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell.

(1994)Science 263, 963–966). To examine the importance of Phe residues for target binding and activation, we purified mutant yCaMs containing single or double Phe to Ala substitutions and determined their ability to bind and activate two target proteins, calcineurin and CaM-dependent protein kinase (CaMK). Binding assays using the gel overlay technique and quantitative analyses using surface plasmon resonance measurements indicated that the binding of yCaM to calcineurin is impaired by either double mutations of F16A/F19A or a single mutation of F140A, while binding to CaMK is impaired by F89A, F92A, or F140A. These same mutant yCaMs fail to activate calcineurin and CaMK, respectively, in vitro. In addition, F19A exhibited a severe defect in activation of both enzymes. F12A activated calcineurin to only 50% of the level achieved by wild-type calmodulin but fully activated CaMK. These results suggest that each target protein requires a specific and distinct subset of Phe residues in yCaM for target binding and activation.

Calmodulin (CaM)1 is a ubiquitous eukaryotic Ca2+-binding protein that regulates diverse cellular functions through its interaction with target proteins such as protein kinases, a protein phosphatase, ion channels, and cytoskeletal components. Strikingly, the CaM-binding motifs of these targets share a low degree of amino acid sequence homology to each other. This fact raises the question of how CaM recognizes such a diversity of target proteins. Structural studies have revealed some important aspects of the molecular mechanism by which CaM interacts with its targets. The crystal structure of CaM in the Ca2+-saturated form is a dumbbell-shaped molecule with N- and C-terminal globular lobes separated by a long central α-helix (1Babu Y.S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 191-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar, 2Taylor D.A. Sack J.S. Maune J.F. Beckingham K. Quiocho F.A. J. Biol.

Biol. 1992; 228: 1177-1192Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). Each domain, comprising a pair of EF hand Ca2+-binding domains, has a concave hydrophobic surface in the center. The solution and crystal structures of CaM with CaM-binding peptides derived from three different target enzymes have demonstrated that the target peptide, adopting an α-helical conformation, is clamped by the two domains on their hydrophobic surfaces (4Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar, 5Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A.

Many hydrophobic interactions as well as some electrostatic interactions appear to contribute to the formation of the CaM-peptide complexes. Thus, the molecular basis of CaM's versatility is explained by the flexible central linker and the clusters of hydrophobic residues on each lobe. However, while the function of the central linker has been biochemically examined (7Craig T.A. Watterson D.M. Prendergast F.G. Haiech J. Roberts D.M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1995; 2: 943-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the role of each hydrophobic residue of CaM has been analyzed by only a few biochemical studies (13Zhang M Li M. Wang J.H. Vogel H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15546-15552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Chin D. Means A.R. J. Biol.

A possible concern in studying these residues is that the replacement of a hydrophobic residue by a smaller, less hydrophobic one may result in gross structural perturbations of CaM. Among the hydrophobic residues of CaM, Phe residues are thought to be functionally important for the following reasons: (i) all of the eight Phe residues in CaM are highly conserved, and (ii) structural studies of CaM-peptide complexes have established that many of the Phe residues of CaM directly contact the hydrophobic residues of the target peptide (4Ikura M. Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Zhu G. Klee C.B. Bax A. Science. 1992; 256: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1176) Google Scholar, 5Meador W.E. Means A.R. Quiocho F.A.

Genetic studies of CaM from budding yeast (yCaM) have indicated that Phe to Ala replacements do not always perturb the gross structure of yCaM (16Ohya Y. Botstein D. Genetics. 1994; 138: 1041-1054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 33 different yCaMs were generated by systematic substitution of one or more Phe residues with Ala. Of these 33 mutant yCaMs, 22 could support the vegetative growth of yeast, suggesting that many of these mutant proteins retained a relatively normal protein structure. Nevertheless, the Phe residues of yCaM were shown to be important for yCaM function. Of the 33 Phe to Ala yCaM mutants, 14 mutant strains were temperature-sensitive. These mutations were classified into four intragenic complementation groups, and the mutants in each group showed different characteristic functional defects (17Ohya Y. Botstein D. Science. 1994; 263: 963-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). These genetic results suggest that each complementation group of the yCaM mutants may represent a single functional defect due to loss of regulation of one essential target and that the mutations that confer temperature sensitivity do not abolish the ability of yCaM to regulate other essential target proteins even at restriction temperature (17Ohya Y. Botstein D. Science. 1994; 263: 963-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, to understand the diversity of yCaM functions, it is important to establish the role of Phe residues of yCaM. This can be done using the Phe to Ala mutant yCaMs that retain normal protein structure. In order to examine the effect of Phe to Ala substitutions of yCaM on their ability to regulate target proteins, we used calcineurin and CaMK, because the activation of these enzymes by mutant yCaMs can be measured in vitro. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the catalytic and the regulatory subunits of calcineurin are encoded byCNA1/CNA2 and CNB1 (18Cyert M.S. Kunisawa R. Kaim D. Thorner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This study presents several lines of biochemical evidence indicating that Phe to Ala substitutions result in altered target binding and activation and that the role of each Phe residue is different for calcineurin and CaMK. Media for growth of S. cerevisiae and Escherichia coli are as described (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Genetic manipulation and yeast transformation were carried out as described (24Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae strains YOC200 (MATa ade2 leu2 lys2 trp1 ura3 cmd1-Δ1::TRP1 ade3::CMD1:HIS3) (16Ohya Y. Botstein D.

Anraku, unpublished result.were used as a positive and a negative control in halo assays, respectively. The other YOC strains have the same genetic background as YOC200 except that each strain harbors a cmd1 allele instead of CMD1 (16Ohya Y. Botstein D. Genetics. 1994; 138: 1041-1054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used for propagation of plasmids and expression of recombinant proteins. E. coli strain BL21 carrying pLysS (25Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4812) Google Scholar) was used for production of yCaMs, calcineurin, and CaMK. Restriction enzymes and modifying enzymes were purchased from Takara (Kyoto, Japan) and New England Biolabs Inc. (Beverly, MA). Synthetic α-factor was purchased from Peptide Institute Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit was purchased from New England Biolabs. [γ-32P]ATP was purchased from ICN Biomedicals Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). Phenyl-Sepharose CL-6B, Sephadex G-25 medium, and PD-10 column were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden). DNase I and α-casein were purchased from Sigma. Centriprep-10 was obtained from Amicon (Beverly, MA). Each oligopeptide containing the yCaM-binding sequence of Cna1p (residues 453–476) or Cmk1p (residues 314–340) with a cysteine residue at its N terminus added (designated as Cna1pep and Cmk1pep, respectively) was custom-synthesized by Toray Research Center. The segment corresponding to Cna1pep in human calcineurin A-2 and the segment corresponding to Cmk1pep in Cmk1p have been shown to interact with bovine CaM and yCaM, respectively (22Pausch M.H. Kaim D. Kunisawa R. Admon A. Thorner J. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 1511-1522Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 26Takano E. Hatanaka M. Maki M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 247-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Each plasmid for expressing wild-type or mutant yCaM (pET-cmd) was constructed by inserting theBstBI--SphI cmd1 fragment (16Ohya Y. Botstein D. Genetics. 1994; 138: 1041-1054Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into aBstBI--BamHI gap of pET-3a after BamHI linker ligation. Plasmids for expressing fusion proteins of Cna1p, Cmk1p, and Cmk2p were made using the GST Gene Fusion System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and a plasmid for expressing a fusion protein of Cna2p was made using the Protein Fusion and Purification System (New England Biolabs) (see Fig. 2 A). A plasmid for expressing Cna1p (pET-CNA1) was made as follows. An NcoI site and anXhoI site were introduced at the start codon and the 3′-noncoding region of CNA1, respectively, by in vitro mutagenesis. This caused a change of the second amino acid residue from Ser to Ala. A 1.7-kilobase pairNcoI–XhoI fragment of CNA1 was inserted into an NcoI–XhoI gap of pET-15b (pET-15b-CNA1) followed by inserting a 1.7-kilobase pairXbaI–XhoI fragment from pET-15b-CNA1 into anXbaI–XhoI gap of pET-3a. A plasmid for expressing Cnb1p (pET-CNB1) was made as follows. An NcoI site and a BamHI site were introduced at the start codon and 3′-noncoding region of CNB1 with an intron removed by two-step PCR, and a 0.5-kilobase pair NcoI–BamHI fragment was inserted into an NcoI–BamHI gap of pET-15b. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA method using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. E. coli strain BL21 carrying pLysS was transformed with each pET-cmd plasmid and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in TB medium containing 30 μg/ml ampicillin. yCaM production was induced by adding isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactoside to a final concentration of 1 mm. After 4 h of incubation, cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and then freeze-thawed. MgCl2 and DNase I were added to final concentrations of 5 mm and 40 μg/ml, respectively, and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. yCaM was purified essentially as described previously (27Ohya Y. Uno I. Ishikawa T. Anraku Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The supernatant containing 1m ammonium sulfate and 1 mm CaCl2was applied to a bed of phenyl-Sepharose 6B equilibrated with 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 m ammonium sulfate and 5 mm CaCl2. After washing with 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mmCaCl2 and an appropriate concentration of ammonium sulfate (0.1–0.5 m) for each wild-type and mutant yCaM, yCaM was eluted with 10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EGTA and the same concentration of ammonium sulfate as used for washing. The eluate was concentrated by ultrafiltraton using Centriprep-10, and stored at −80 °C. HPLC gel filtration was performed using TSK gel G3000SW (Toyo-Soda) equilibrated with 50 mmTris/HCl (pH 7.5) containing 200 mm NaCl and 1 mm CaCl2. Purified wild-type and mutant yCaMs were biotinylated using ImmunoPure Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin Kit (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Fusion proteins containing yCaM-binding sequences of calcineurin and CaMK were expressed in E. colistrain DH5α. Extracts containing individual fusion proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated at room temperature for 1 h with 2% (w/v) nonfat dry milk in 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.05% Tween 20. The blocked membrane was probed at room temperature for 1.5 h with 400 nm or 4 μmbiotinylated wild-type or mutant yCaM in Ca2+ buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm CaCl2). The membrane was washed with Ca2+ buffer three times, each for 10 min, and air-dried. Biotinylated horseradish peroxidase-avidin complex was coupled to biotinylated yCaM using Vectastain Elite standard kit (Vector laboratories). After washing with Ca2+ buffer three times, each for 10 min, the membrane was stained using the POD immunostain set (Wako). Interactions of mutant yCaMs with Cna1pep and Cmk1pep were analyzed by SPR measurements using the IAsys biosensor (Fisons Applied Sensor Technology). All manipulations were carried out at 25 °C. Cna1pep or Cmk1pep was covalently coupled to the carboxymethyldextran-coated biosensor cuvette via the thiol group of the N-terminal cysteine residue according to the manufacturer's instructions. After establishing a base line with 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm CaCl2, 250 mm NaCl, and 0.005% Tween 20, the binding of mutant or wild-type yCaM was monitored as an increase in the evanescent field response. The cuvette was regenerated with 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm EGTA, 250 mm NaCl, and 0.005% Tween 20. E. coli strain BL21 carrying pLysS was transformed individually with pET-CNA1 and pET-CNB1 and grown to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5 at 23 °C and of 0.25 at 37 °C, respectively, in TB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol. The production of Cna1p and Cnb1p was induced by adding isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactoside to final concentrations of 0.1 and 1 mm, respectively. Cells were collected by centrifugation; resuspended in 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm EDTA, 10 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mmbenzamidine HCl, and 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, aprotinin, and chymostatin); and then freezed-thawed. After sonication, the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. Supernatants containing Cna1p and Cnb1p were mixed and then incubated at 4 °C for 24 h. Reconstituted calcineurin was precipitated by adding 30% ammonium sulfate, and the precipitate was resuspended in buffer A (50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, 1 mm CaCl2, and protease inhibitors) and was dialyzed against buffer A at 4 °C. The dialysate was applied to yCaM-conjugated Sepharose 4B equilibrated with buffer A. After it was washed with 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm DTT, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 m NaCl, and protease inhibitors, calcineurin was eluted with 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mmDTT, 5 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors. The eluate was dialyzed against 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm DTT, 5 mm sodium ascorbate, 0.5 mm FeSO4, and 50% glycerol. Dephosphorylated α-casein (20 mg/ml) in 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) containing 10 mmMgCl2, 10 μm EGTA, 15 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 200 μm ATP with a specific activity of 800–1000 cpm/pmol, and 50 units/ml cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit was incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. 32P-Labeled α-casein was separated from unincorporated label by gel filtration on Sephadex G-25 medium (1 × 30-cm) equilibrated with buffer B (50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 15 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 5% (v/v) glycerol). The peak fractions of 32P-labeled α-casein were further applied to a PD-10 column equilibrated with buffer B, and the protein-containing fractions were collected. Phosphatase activity was assayed at 30 °C for 20 min in a 50 μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm DTT, 5 mm sodium ascorbate, 32P-labeled α-casein corresponding to 100 pmol of Pi, yCaM, and calcineurin. The release of Pi was measured by a modified version of the organic extraction procedure (28Titanji V.P.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 481: 140-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 29Shacter-Noiman E. Chock P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 258: 4214-4219Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by adding 400 μl of 5 mm silicotungstate in 5 mmH2SO4 and 600 μl of a 1:1 mixture of isobutyl alcohol and benzene. After vortexing briefly, 80 μl of 5% (w/v) ammonium molybdate in 2 m H2SO4 was added, and the solution was vigorously mixed for 10–15 s. The organic and inorganic phases were separated by centrifugation in a tabletop centrifuge for 5 min, and the amount of radioactivity in 400 μl of the organic phase was determined. CaMK (Cmk1p) was purified as described previously with some modification (21Ohya Y. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Londesborough J. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12784-12794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). E. colistrain BL21 carrying pLysS was transformed with pET-CMK1(21Ohya Y. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Londesborough J. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12784-12794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and grown to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.1 at 37 °C in TB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol. Cmk1p production was induced by adding isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mm. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in buffer C (20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors containing 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine HCl, and 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin A, aprotinin, and chymostatin), and then freeze-thawed. After sonication, the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Nucleic acids were removed by adding 5% (w/w) protamine sulfate followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 20 min. The supernatant was adjusted to 0.2 m NaCl and applied to phenyl-Sepharose 6B equilibrated with buffer C containing 0.2m NaCl. After washing with two bed volumes of buffer C containing 0.2 m NaCl, proteins were eluted with a linear gradient from 0.2 to 0 m NaCl in buffer C. The peak fractions of CaMK activity were pooled. Proteins in the pooled fractions were concentrated by 80% ammonium sulfate. The precipitate was resuspended in buffer C and dialyzed against buffer D (20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mm DTT, 1 mm CaCl2, 10% glycerol, and protease inhibitors) at 4 °C. The dialysate was applied to yCaM-conjugated Sepharose 4B equilibrated with buffer D. After washing with 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm DTT, 1 mm CaCl2, 0.5 m NaCl, and protease inhibitors, CaMK was eluted with 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm DTT, 5 mm EGTA, and protease inhibitors. The eluate was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5) containing 1 mm DTT and 50% glycerol. CaMK was assayed essentially as described previously (21Ohya Y. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Londesborough J.

The reaction mixture (20 μl) containing 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm DTT, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 μm kemptoamide, 200 μm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity approximately 100 cpm/pmol), yCaM, and CaMK was incubated at 30 °C for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 10 μl of acetic acid. Incorporated Pi in kemptoamide was measured as described by Ohya et al. (21Ohya Y. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Londesborough J. Anraku Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12784-12794Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dissociation constants from binding assays were determined as follows. First, the response change at equilibrium was determined by nonlinear regression with an equation representing one-site binding and plotted for each yCaM concentration. Dissociation constants were determined by nonlinear regression of this plot with the Michaelis-Menten equation. Kinetic parameters for enzyme activation were determined by nonlinear regression with the Michaelis-Menten equation. MAT a haploids were picked as colonies from fresh plates and grown at 23 °C in YPD medium. The fully grown culture was suspended in soft (1.5%) melted YPD agar that had been warmed at 55 °C to make 1–2 × 106cells/ml of suspension. Cells were then plated on prewarmed YPD-Suc agar plates containing 1% Bacto-yeast extract, 2% polypeptone, 2% glucose, 2% succinate and 2% agar. Glucose and succinate were autoclaved separately. After solidification of the top agar, sterile filter disks (diameter 6 mm) were placed aseptically on the surface of the nascent lawn, and 1.6 nmol of synthetic α-factor (5 μl) was pipetted onto sterile filter disks. The plates were incubated at 23 °C for 3, 5, and 7 days before photographs were taken. Because of the extended period of incubation, this assay has been useful to measure the capacity of cells to recover from α-factor arrest and resume growth. These assays were performed for each yCaM mutant at least three times. All of the individual Phe to Ala mutants of yCaM as well as the double mutants (F16A/F19A and F65A/F68A) could be expressed at a reasonably high level in E. coli and purified by Ca2+-dependent phenyl-Sepharose chromatography. It is known that yCaM, like mammalian CaM, migrates differently during SDS-PAGE in the presence of Ca2+ or EGTA (27Ohya Y. Uno I. Ishikawa T. Anraku Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 13-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The presence of Ca2+ increases the electrophoretic mobility of yCaM. Fig. 1 shows the SDS-PAGE results for wild-type yCaM and yCaMs harboring a single point mutation (F12A, F16A, F19A, F89A, F92A, or F140A) or double mutations (F65A/F68A). Wild-type yCaM and all of the single-point mutant yCaMs exhibited an apparent molecular mass of 16.0 ± 0.2 kDa in the presence of EGTA and 12.6 ± 0.2 kDa in the presence of Ca2+ during SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1). In contrast, some of the mutants with two or more Phe to Ala substitutions showed significantly altered mobility in the presence of EGTA. For example, F65A/F68A exhibited a larger apparent molecular mass of 16.9 kDa in the presence of EGTA (Fig. 1). However, another double mutant, F16A/F19A, showed a mobility similar to that of wild-type yCaM (data not shown), indicating that double mutations do not always result in the irregular mobility. Thus, the single substitution Phe to Ala mutations and the F16A/F19A double mutation combination did not significantly perturb the global protein structure of yCaM. A triple mutant protein, F12A/F16A/F19A ran more slowly than wild-type yCaM, exhibiting an apparent molecular mass of 17.1 kDa in the presence of EGTA and 13.2 kDa in the presence of Ca2+. A quintuple mutant protein, F12A/F16A/F19A/F65A/F68A, that caused a lethal effect in yeast cells ran even more slowly (data not shown). Thus, the altered mobility of the triple and quintuple mutant proteins is probably due to global conformational changes induced by the multiple Phe to Ala substitutions. For the purpose of examining the global conformations of mutant CaMs under native conditions, gel filtration chromatography can be used (14Chin D. Means A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30465-30471Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). All of the single substitution mutant yCaMs exhibited nearly identical retention times, further suggesting that the single substitution mutations do not cause global structural perturbations of yCaM (Table I).Table IRetention time of mutant yCaMs in gel filtration chromatographyAlleleRetention timeminWild type18.5F12A18.4F16A18.5F19A18.5F65A/F68A18.5F89A18.5F92A18.4F140A18.3Retention time was represented as the mean value with the S.D. of ±0.1 based on three independent experiments. Open table in a new tab Retention time was represented as the mean value with the S.D. of ±0.1 based on three independent experiments. We performed gel overlay assays to investigate the allele-specific binding of mutant yCaMs to calcineurin and CaMK. Fragments of the target enzymes containing the yCaM-binding sequences were expressed in E. coli as fusions with GST for Cna1p, Cmk1p, and Cmk2p or as a fusion with MalE for Cna2p (Fig. 2 A). Fig. 2 Bclearly shows that the binding of mutant yCaMs to each target protein is allele-specific and that binding specificity differs for calcineurin and CaMK. yCaM binding to GST-Cna1 and MalE-Cna2 were severely impaired for mutant yCaMs possessing the substitutions F19A or F140A (lanes 4, 5, 8, and 9). On the other hand, yCaM binding to GST-Cmk1 or GST-Cmk2 was not detected for mutant yCaMs possessing a mutation in the C-terminal half, F89A, F92A, or F140A (lanes 6–8). A triple mutant protein, F12A/F16A/F19A, also failed to bind to both GST-Cmk1 and GST-Cmk2. For each yCaM, equivalent binding was always observed to the two different isoforms of calcineurin, GST-Cna1 and MalE-Cna2. However, slightly different results were observed for GST-Cmk1 and GST-Cmk2. F19A and F16A/F19A were shown to have slightly reduced affinities for GST-Cmk1 but not for GST-Cmk2, whereas the binding of F89A was more weakened for GST-Cmk2 than GST-Cmk1. In order to quantify the binding of wild-type or mutant yCaMs to calcineurin and CaMK, we determined the kinetic parameters of binding using an optical biosensor (Table II). Cna1pep and Cmk1pep, which contain the yCaM-binding sequences of Cna1p (positions 453–476) and Cmk1p (positions 314–340), respectively, were individually immobilized on cuvettes via their N-terminal cysteine residues, and their interactions with wild-type and mutant yCaMs were monitored in real time.Table IIKinetic parameters for binding and activation of enzymes by mutant yCaMsyCaMCalcineurinCaMKK dK CaMV maxK dK CaMV maxnmnm%μmμm%Wild type57611000.720.40100F12A36100540.421.7101F16A941701021.22.177F19A170130130.991.130F16A/F19A790630201.9NDNDF65A/F68A6581640.361.590F89A1909886NDNDNDF92A31016089NDNDNDF140A82023059NDNDNDK d is the"

The 10-kilobase pair K18 gene contains all of the genetic information necessary for tissue-specific, copy number-dependent and integration site-independent expression in transgenic mice. We identified a 100-base pair regulatory element that activates the K18 proximal promoter in the presence of the previously identified first intron enhancer. Deletion of the element greatly diminished K18 expression. This regulatory element also has cryptic, AP-1-dependent promoter activity in the absence of the normal promoter, which results in 10–40-fold higher levels of K18 RNA expression in transgenic mice. The high activity of this cryptic promoter is dependent upon the first intron enhancer. These experiments define interactive regulatory regions of the K18 gene that modulate expression in diverse epithelial cell types and identify an unusual regulatory element with promoter activity that may be useful for high level heterologous gene expression in transgenic animals.

Keratin 18 (K18)1 is a type I keratin intermediate filament protein, which is first expressed at the eight-cell stage of mouse embryogenesis and then is restricted to the trophectodermal epithelium of the blastocyst stage mouse embryo. In adult organisms, K18 is restricted in expression to “simple” or single layered epithelia including intestine, lung, liver, breast, and uterus and is usually not found in skeletal muscle, heart, or lymphoid tissues such as spleen (1Abe M. Oshima R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1197-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 2Moll R. Franke W.W. Schiller D.L. Geiger B. Krepler R. Cell. 1982; 31: 11-24Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4474) Google Scholar). The persistent expression of K18 in cancers derived from such tissues, even when other differentiated functions diminish, is a useful diagnostic tool for carcinomas (3Oshima R.G. Baribault H. Caulin C. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1996; 15: 445-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The tissue-restricted expression of K18 is of particular interest because of the broad diversity of K18-positive epithelial cells. In transgenic mice, the 10-kb K18 gene is expressed in an appropriate tissue-specific and copy number-dependent manner, independent of integration site (1Abe M. Oshima R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1197-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 4Neznanov N. Thorey I.S. Ceceña G. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell.

The 10-kb K18 gene contains sufficient genetic information for both qualitatively and quantitatively appropriate tissue-specific regulation. However, the same gene sequence is promiscuously expressed when transiently transfected into cultured cells that do not express the endogenous mouse K18 (6Kulesh D.A. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1540-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 7Pankov R. Umezawa A. Maki R. Der C.J. Hauser C.A. Oshima R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 873-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Accurate control of K18 gene regulation requires a normal developmental environment and a cis-acting mechanism of restriction apparently not active in transfected fibroblasts (8Oshima R.G. Trevor K. Shevinsky L.H. Ryder O.A. Ceceña G. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,9Umezawa A. Yamamoto H. Rhodes K. Klemsz M.J. Maki R.A. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4885-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Multiple regions of the K18 gene have been implicated in its regulation. The previously characterized 250-bp proximal promoter utilizes a TATA box for accurate initiation and multiple Sp1 binding sites and has been implicated in differential expression in certain tumor cells (6Kulesh D.A. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1540-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 10Gunther M. Frebourg T. Laithier M. Fossar N. Bouziane-Ouartini M. Lavialle C. Brison O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2490-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The first intron contains a 100-bp enhancer element with binding sites of the AP-1 and Ets transcription factors (11Oshima R.G. Abrams L. Kulesh D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 835-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and mediates increased expression by the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway (7Pankov R. Umezawa A. Maki R. Der C.J. Hauser C.A. Oshima R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 873-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). DNA methylation of a CpG dinucleotide in the Ets binding site of the first intron enhancer is correlated with the transcriptional silence of K18 in transgenic mice. Changing 2 bp of this Ets binding site, which abolishes its methylation potential but retains its enhancer activity, results in greatly elevated expression in normally nonpermissive tissues of transgenic mice (9Umezawa A. Yamamoto H. Rhodes K. Klemsz M.J. Maki R.A. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4885-4894Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This alteration in the tissue-biased expression of transgenic K18 indicates that methylation of the Ets binding site within the first intron enhancer may be essential for initiating or maintaining the repressed state of the K18 gene. The first intron also contains three silencer elements, which act primarily in undifferentiated stem cells (12Pankov R. Neznanov N. Umezawa A. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7744-7757Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the sixth exon contains a complex regulatory element located within a coding portion of the gene that cooperates with the first intron enhancer to modulate K18 expression (13Neznanov N.S. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 14Neznanov N. Umezawa A. Oshima R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27549-27557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The 5′- and 3′-flanking regions of the gene are important for position-independent and copy number-dependent expression of the K18 gene (4Neznanov N. Thorey I.S. Ceceña G. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2214-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 5Thorey I.S. Ceceña G. Reynolds W. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6742-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These characteristics appear to be independent of the 250-bp proximal promoter, the first intron, and exon 6, because heterologous genes containing just the extreme flanking regions of the K18 gene acquire the properties of position-independent and copy number-dependent expression in transgenic mice (5Thorey I.S. Ceceña G. Reynolds W. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6742-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 15Neznanov N. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Oshima R.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 541-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). We have now confirmed the central importance of the first intron enhancer in vivo. In addition, we have identified an unusual new regulatory element upstream of the K18 250-bp proximal promoter region, which cooperates with the first intron enhancer. Surprisingly, this element can act as a promoter in the absence of the normal K18 proximal promoter, both in transgenic mice and in transfected cells. The activity of this promoter is abolished by mutagenesis of an AP-1/ATF binding site. Within the context of the remaining regulatory elements of the K18 gene, this cryptic promoter can result in an extremely high level of epithelial specific gene expression in transgenic mice. The K18 gene contained in plasmid pGC1853 was described previously (GenBankTM accession number M24842) (16Kulesh D.A. Oshima R.G. Genomics. 1989; 4: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The transcriptional start site of K18 is bp 2537. pGC1853d47, used to make K18d47 mice, was also described previously (12Pankov R. Neznanov N. Umezawa A. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7744-7757Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The K18dP1 vector represents a deletion of K18 bp 2286–2658. K18dP2 contains a substitution of GGCCTGCA in place of bp 1372–2658. K18dP3 and K18dP4 were derived from the previously described K18-TATA vector (12Pankov R. Neznanov N. Umezawa A. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7744-7757Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) by deleting sequences corresponding to K18 bp 1372–2496 and 2286–2496, respectively. The sequence TGCAGATC was left in place of the deletion of K18dP3. K18dP5 and K18dP7 were derived from K18-dB and K18-dAB, respectively (5Thorey I.S. Ceceña G. Reynolds W. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6742-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), by deleting the sequences between the uniqueXhoI site and the XmaIII sites. K18dP6 represents a deletion of bp 2113–2658. K18dP1d47 was derived from pGC1853d47 (12Pankov R. Neznanov N. Umezawa A. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7744-7757Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) by digestion of pGC1853d47 with XhoI and XmaIII ligating the filled sites, resulting in a deletion from bp 2286–2658. LsCAT was constructed from K18dP7. A 91-bp fragment (K18 bp 2191–2282) of the K18 gene (Fig. 2) was isolated from K18dP7 by digestion withBglII and XhoI, blunt-ended with mung bean nuclease (New England Biolabs), and cloned into a promoterless CAT expression vector, KOCATspa (11Oshima R.G. Abrams L. Kulesh D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 835-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). LsCATE was made from LsCAT and XKCATE (12Pankov R. Neznanov N. Umezawa A. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7744-7757Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) by switching vector backbones using EcoRI and NotI sites present on both vectors. This results in a vector with both the 91-bp cryptic promoter and the 100-bp first intron enhancer fragment. To generate the K18LL plasmid, a K18 fragment (bp 1457–2181) was amplified using two primers: K18–1429S (GGT GAT ATA CCG GTG TGC AGA AGT CAG) and XhoI-2180A (GCG CTC GAG CTT GAC CGG GCG CAG TGG). The amplified fragment was digested with NsiI and XhoI and cloned into pGC1853 cut with the same enzymes. The resulting K18LL plasmid contains a deletion of 87 bp (K18 bp 2199–2286) as well as a deletion between the two upstreamNsiI sites (bp 1372–1457), sequences previously shown not to affect expression of the gene (4Neznanov N. Thorey I.S. Ceceña G. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2214-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). K18LLd47 was constructed in the same way, utilizing pGC1853d47. A K18 fragment was amplified with two primers, XhoI-2189S (CCG CTC GAG CCG GTC AAG ACT CCC AAA) and XhoI-2288A (CGC CTC GAG CCT CGA GGC TGC TTT CAG). TheXhoI product was ligated to the similarly digested XKCAT vector. The same procedure was used to construct LsXKCATE and LaXKCATE, except that the starting vector was XKCATE instead of XKCAT. A K18 fragment amplified with two primers, BamHI-2189S (CCG GGA TCC CCG GTC AAG ACT CCC AAA) and BamHI-2288A (CGC GGA TCC CCT CGA GGC TGC TTT CAG), was cut with BamHI and ligated to the similarly digested XKCAT vector. The same procedure was used to construct XKCATLsE and XKCATLaE, except that the starting vector was XKCATE instead of XKCAT. The mutation in the AP-1/ATF binding motif was made using the Quik-Change site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Oligonucleotides were used that changed the sequence from TAACGTCATTTCC to TAGATCTATTTCC. This change created a BglII restriction site, and mutagenesis was confirmed by digestion of the resulting plasmid with BglII and sequencing. The wild type and mutant sequences were analyzed using Transcription Element Search Software (TESS) from the Computation Biology and Informatics Laboratory at the University of Pennsylvania. 2Available on the World Wide Web athttp://agave.humgen.upenn.edu/utess/tess32. The mutated sequence was not identified as a binding site for AP-1, ATF, or cAMP response element-binding protein by the same program. Transfections and CAT assays were performed as previously described (11Oshima R.G. Abrams L. Kulesh D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 835-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 13Neznanov N.S. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1815-1823Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from transfected cells with the use of the acidic phenol method (17Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 162: 156-159Crossref Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). RNA was digested with RNase-free DNase I (Promega) to eliminate possible contaminating vector DNA (12Pankov R. Neznanov N. Umezawa A. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7744-7757Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 18Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 71-78Google Scholar). The RNA probe was transcribed in vitro from pK18EBrp, which contains the 470-bp EcoRI–BglII first exon fragment from pK187. This fragment was cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene), linearized with EcoRI, and transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase (Stratagene) to produce a radioactive 519-nucleotide probe. Total RNA was isolated from transgenic mouse organs by the guanidinium isothiocyanate-cesium chloride method (19Turpen T.H. Griffith O.M. BioTechniques. 1986; 4: 11-15Google Scholar) as described previously (1Abe M. Oshima R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1197-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The L32 ribosomal protein RNA was measured as described previously (14Neznanov N. Umezawa A. Oshima R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27549-27557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). An oligonucleotide complementary to the first exon (TGAAGCTGGTGGAGCGGGACACGGAGATCCGG) was labeled to a high specific activity (5 × 106 cpm/pmol) with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 2 × 105 cpm of oligonucleotide was coprecipitated with indicated amounts of RNA or with 20 μg of tRNA as a carrier. The resulting pellet was dissolved in 20 μl of 80 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 80 mmKCl; incubated at 95 °C; and allowed to cool slowly to 67 °C. After incubation for 1 h at 44 °C, an equal volume of buffer containing first strand buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.); a 1 mm concentration each of dCTP, dATP, dTTP, and 7-deaza-dGTP; 1 unit/μl RNase Block (Stratagene); 0.1 μg/μl actinomycin D; 10 mm dithiothreitol; and 200 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) were added for each reaction. The samples were incubated for 1 h at 44 °C. The diluted samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, and resolved on a 6% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. Radioactivity was detected by autoradiography or with a phosphor imager (Bio-Rad). K18dP1d47 and K18d47 transgenic mice were generated by injection of vector-free DNA fragments into the pronucleus of fertilized eggs of the FVB/N strain of mice by standard methods (20Hogan B. Constantini F. Lacy E. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1987Google Scholar). The transgenic mice were produced by the Burnham Institute Mouse Genetics Shared Service and were identified by dot blot hybridization of tail DNA. Nucleic acid analysis was performed on F1 generation mice as described previously (1Abe M. Oshima R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1197-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 5Thorey I.S.

Biol. 1993; 160: 519-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). K18dP1 mice were produced by the same methods by the NICHD (National Institutes of Health) Transgenic Mouse Development Facility and DNX Inc. (Princeton, NJ). The founder animals were C57BL/6 × SJL F2 hybrids. Subsequent breeding was performed with the FVB/N strain of mice. Autoradiograph film exposures were digitized with the use of a flat bed scanner (HP ScanJet IIC) and Adobe Photoshop software. Quantitation of radioactivity was performed with a Bio-Rad phosphor imager. A deletion analysis of the K18 promoter region (Fig. 1 A) was performed to identify a transcriptionally inactive K18 gene. Multiple constructs were transfected into HR9 parietal endodermal cells, which express endogenous mouse K18, and RNA was analyzed by RNase protection using probes for both the K18 and the co-transfected pMC1Neo gene (Fig. 1 B). The Neo transcript protects 240 nucleotides of the Neo probe. K18 RNA containing all of the first exon protects 470 nucleotides of the K18 probe. Surprisingly, deletion of the entire 250-bp K18 proximal promoter region, including the TATA box, does not abolish transcription of the gene (Fig. 1 A, dP1; Fig. 1 B, lane 6). The K18dP1 construct yields a fragment of 338 nucleotides, corresponding to the size of the truncated exon 1. This suggests that there is a cryptic promoter upstream of the K18 promoter (designated the Lazarus promoter). K18dP3 (Fig. 1 A, dP3), which differs from K18dP1 by the inclusion of the region downstream of the TATA box (bp 2496–2658), had activity similar to that of K18dP1 (Fig. 1 B, lane 8). The protected fragment size of K18dP3 is similar to wild type K18 because the 5′-end of exon 1 is included in the construct. Thus, the sequences downstream of the TATA box in the proximal promoter and the first 137 bp of exon 1 are not necessary for the activity of the Lazarus promoter. Transfection of constructs K18dP2, K18dP4, and K18dP6 did not result in detectable K18 RNA (Fig. 3 B, lanes 7, 9, and 11). Thus, the 170 bp contained in K18dP1, but not in K18dP2, K18dP4, or K18dP6, is necessary for transcription from the Lazarus promoter. The close juxtaposition of the Lazarus promoter region and the oppositely oriented RNA polymerase III promoter of the proximal Alu sequence (Fig. 1 A) prompted consideration of whether the A and B box elements of the Alu promoter (5Thorey I.S. Ceceña G. Reynolds W. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6742-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) might influence the activity of the Lazarus promoter. To test this, K18dP5 and K18dP7 were constructed from two previously characterized mutant forms of K18 that contained either a mutation of the B box or a deletion of both the A and B boxes and the intervening sequences. Both of these mutations inactivated the polymerase III promoter (5Thorey I.S. Ceceña G. Reynolds W. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6742-6751Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The deletion of the sequences between the A and B boxes in K18dP7 also removed several potential regulatory elements (Fig. 2). Both K18dP5 and K18dP7 were capable of expressing K18 RNA (Fig. 1 B, lanes 10 and 12). However, K18dP5, in which the B box is mutated, was consistently more active than K18dP1, in which the Alu promoter would be expected to be active. An active Alu polymerase III promoter may be detrimental to optimal activity of the Lazarus promoter in transfected cells. The lower activity of K18dP7, which contains a deletion of the region between and including the A and B boxes, compared with K18dP5 and K18dP1 could reflect the use of the factor binding sites such as that for Sp1, located between the A and B boxes when the polymerase III promoter is inactive. Importantly, the results from K18dP7 indicate that the 100 bp region between the XhoI site and the A box element is necessary for the Lazarus promoter activity. Sequence analysis of the Lazarus promoter region (Fig. 2) shows that there is no apparent similarity of the Lazarus promoter with the sequence of the K18 proximal promoter. However, potential binding sites for AP-1, ATF, Ets, and Sp1 transcription factors are found in the Lazarus promoter sequence. AP-1 factors are involved in the activation of the K18 gene through two other regulatory regions of the K18 gene (intron 1 and exon 6), Ets activates K18 through the enhancer in intron 1, and Sp1 acts on the proximal promoter (10Gunther M. Frebourg T. Laithier M. Fossar N. Bouziane-Ouartini M. Lavialle C. Brison O. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2490-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In order to determine whether the Lazarus promoter can drive expression of a heterologous gene and to determine the region sufficient for promoter activity, putative promoter fragments of between 100 and 2000 bp were placed upstream of a CAT reporter gene. The 100 bp just upstream of the deletion junction, including the transcription start sites but not the Alu sequences, were found to be sufficient for promoter activity in transient transfection of HR9 cells. Constructs containing longer fragments of 800 or 2000 bp had activity similar to or slightly lower than that of constructs containing only 100 bp (data not shown). Therefore, LsCAT (Fig. 3, construct 12), which contained only this fragment, was used in further experiments. Lazarus promoter constructs were transiently transfected into HR9 cells (Fig. 3, lines 12–15). The Lazarus promoter was more active than the K18 proximal promoter (Fig. 3, constructs 1 and 12). The K18 promoter was further activated by the addition of the first intron enhancer, whereas the Lazarus promoter was not (Fig. 3, constructs 6 and 14). Mutating the AP-1/ATF binding element in the Lazarus promoter greatly reduced its activity (Fig. 3, constructs 13 and 15). We have not detected transcripts attributable to the Lazarus promoter when the K18 proximal promoter is present in any transgenic mouse line or tissue, by either RNase or S1 protection analysis (6Kulesh D.A. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1540-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 11Oshima R.G. Abrams L. Kulesh D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 835-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 21Thorey I.S. Meneses J. Neznanov N. Kulesh D. Pedersen R. Oshima R.G. Dev. Biol. 1993; 160: 519-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). To determine if the Lazarus element has additional regulatory properties, it was tested in different positions and orientations in the presence of the normal K18 proximal promoter and the CAT reporter gene (Fig. 3,constructs 1–11) and with or without the intron enhancer (Fig. 3). The Lazarus regulatory element does not increase expression of the CAT gene driven by the K18 proximal promoter in the absence of the first intron enhancer (Fig. 3, constructs 2–5). However, when the 100-bp first intron enhancer is present, the addition of the Lazarus element upstream further increases CAT activity 2–3-fold (Fig. 3, constructs 7 and 8). When placed downstream of the CAT gene next to the enhancer (Fig. 3, constructs 9 and 10), the Lazarus element appeared neutral. Therefore, the Lazarus element acts as a positive regulatory element in the presence of the K18 first intron enhancer and in the position it is found in the K18 gene, upstream of the K18 proximal promoter. Mutation of the AP-1/ATF binding site of the Lazarus element decreases its enhancer activity modestly. The same mutation nearly eliminates promoter activity of the Lazarus element. Additional experiments confirmed that this mutation abolished AP-1 binding, as indicated by oligonucleotide mobility shift experiments with purified c-Jun and c-Fos or with liver nuclear extracts (data not shown). To evaluate the potential importance of the Lazarus element to K18 expression within the context of the multiple regulatory elements of the whole gene, the Lazarus element was deleted from the K18 gene and tested by transfection analysis (Fig. 4 A). In K18LL, only the 87 bp of the Lazarus promoter were deleted, leaving the K18 proximal promoter and the Alu element upstream intact. In K18LLd47, the inactivating deletion of the first intron enhancer was included. The results of transient transfection analysis of HR9 cells are shown in Fig. 4 B. The protected fragments from lanes 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, and 19 were quantitated by phosphor imager analysis, and the results are shown in Fig. 4 C. Alternative lanes (Fig. 4 B, lanes 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20) confirm that additional Ets2 and AP-1 do not result in higher expression, presumably because the activities of these two transcription factor families are not limiting in these cells (14Neznanov N. Umezawa A. Oshima R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27549-27557Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Deletion of the intron enhancer element reduced the expression of K18 and K18dP1 by 62 and 56%, respectively (Fig. 4 C, K18d47 and K18dP1d47). The deletion of the Lazarus element alone (K18LL) reduces the expression of the K18 gene by 64%, to a level equivalent to that seen when the first intron enhancer alone is deleted. This reinforces the view that the Lazarus element has a positive regulatory function. Deletion of both the Lazarus element and the first intron enhancer decreases expression 81%. These results confirm that both the Lazarus element and the intron enhancer contribute significantly to the expression of the K18 gene in differentiated endodermal cells. The importance of the intron enhancer had not been tested in vivo; therefore, a construct in which 54 base pairs of the 100-bp enhancer region were deleted (including all 47 base pairs that are conserved between the mouse and human genes) (12Pankov R. Neznanov N. Umezawa A. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7744-7757Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4 A) was used to generate three new transgenic mouse strains. This deletion completely inactivated the enhancer in transfection experiments (11Oshima R.G. Abrams L. Kulesh D. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 835-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). All three strains transmitted the gene to offspring. Southern blot analysis confirmed the presence of the 54-bp deletion and was used to estimate copy number (data not shown; Table I). All three mouse lines integrated the construct in the normal head to tail array without apparent rearrangements (data not shown). RNase protection and analysis of RNA isolated from each strain was used to determine expression levels of the gene in eight different organs or tissues that have been extensively analyzed for normal K18 expression (1Abe M. Oshima R.G. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1197-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 4Neznanov N. Thorey I.S. Ceceña G. Oshima R.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2214-2223Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis detected the expected length of the mRNAs, confirming previous findings that the intron deletion did not lead to major alterations in splicing (data not shown). All three strains of K18d47 mice showed greatly reduced expression of K18 in normally permissive liver, kidney, and intestine. However, the levels of K18 RNA were still proportional to the copy number of each construction, which varied between 6 and 66 genes/cell. Thus, the inactivation of the enhancer decreased expression of K18 but did not abolish its copy number dependence. Levels of K18 expression in all organs except kidney were less than 2 pg of K18 RNA/10 μg of RNA/gene. In normally nonpermissive tissues such as spleen, heart, and muscle, levels of K18d47 RNA were near the limits of detection by RNase protection. The average level of expression of K18 and K18d47 RNA are compared in Fig. 5 A. The deletion of the enhancer resulted in a decrease of between 45 and 85% in permissive tissues. Expression in liver was influenced most, and kidney was least affected.Table IK18 expression in transgenic mice* Values determined by Northern blot; all others determined by RNase protection assay.

https://openalex.org/W2028311577,"Abstract An iron-sulfur flavoprotein (Isf) from the methanoarchaeaon Methanosarcina thermophila, which participates in electron transfer reactions required for the fermentation of acetate to methane, was characterized by electrochemistry and EPR and Mossbauer spectroscopy. The midpoint potential (E m) of the FMN/FMNH2 couple was −0.277 V. No flavin semiquinone was observed during potentiometric titrations; however, low amounts of the radical were observed when Isf was quickly frozen after reaction with CO and the CO dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase complex from M. thermophila. Isf contained a [4Fe-4S]2+/1+ cluster with g values of 2.06 and 1.93 and an unusual split signal with g values at 1.86 and 1.82. The unusual morphology was attributed to microheterogeneity among Isf molecules. The E mvalue for the 2+/1+ redox couple of the cluster was −0.394 V. Extracts from H2-CO2-grown Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum cells catalyzed either the H2- or CO-dependent reduction of M. thermophila Isf. In addition, Isf homologs were found in the genomic sequences of the CO2-reducing methanoarchaea M. thermoautotrophicum and Methanococcus jannaschii. These results support a general role for Isf in electron transfer reactions of both acetate-fermenting and CO2-reducing methanoarchaea. It is suggested that Isf functions to couple electron transfer from ferredoxin to membrane-bound electron carriers, such as methanophenazine and/or b-type cytochromes."

Eight herpesviruses have been implicated to date in the etiology of a number of human diseases. These are subdivided into three families on the basis of their biological properties, host cell range and the organization of their genomes (1Roizman B. Whitley R.J. Lopez C. The Human Herpesviruses. Raven Press, New York1993Google Scholar). Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1)1 and type 2 (HSV-2) and varicella zoster virus (VZV), the causative agent of chicken pox and shingles, comprise the α-subgroup while Epstein-Barr virus and the recently discovered human herpesvirus 8 (which has been implicated in Kaposi's sarcoma in human immunodeficiency virus-positive individuals; Ref. 2Moore P.S.

The β-subgroup consists of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and human herpesviruses 6 and 7 (HHV-6 and HHV-7). HHV-6 causes the childhood illness exanthem subitum (3Yamanishi K. Okuno T. Shiraki K. Takahashi M. Kondo T. Asano Y. Kurata T. Lancet. 1988; i: 1065-1067Abstract Scopus (1280) Google Scholar) and has also been implicated in the progression of a number of other diseases, including multiple sclerosis (4Soldan S.S. Berti R.

Med. 1992; 116: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). In common with the other herpesviruses, HHV-6 encodes its own proteinase, which is essential for capsid maturation, DNA packaging, and the ultimate formation of new virus particles (6Preston V.G. Rixon F.J. McDougall I.M. McGregor M. Al Kobaisi M.F. Virology. 1992; 186: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The mature proteinase consists of 230 residues but is synthesized in the form of a precursor, which has an additional 298 residues attached to the C terminus of the mature enzyme (see Ref. 7Tigue N.J. Matharu P.J. Roberts N.A. Mills J.S. Kay J. Jupp R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4136-4141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 1). Autolytic removal of these residues (which themselves constitute a form of the viral assembly protein; Ref. 6Preston V.G. Rixon F.J. McDougall I.M. McGregor M. Al Kobaisi M.F. Virology. 1992; 186: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) releases the N-terminal proteinase in its mature form; processing takes place at two locations positioned, respectively, at the C terminus of the proteinase (R-site; Fig. 1) and 37 residues from the C terminus of the precursor (M-site; Fig. 1). In the HHV-6 precursor, just as in the counterpart proteins from most other herpesviruses, both of these processing sites consist of ∼Ala*Ser∼ residues in the ∼P1*P1′∼ positions (7Tigue N.J. Matharu P.J. Roberts N.A. Mills J.S. Kay J. Jupp R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4136-4141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,8Gibson W. Welch A.R. Hall M.R.T. Perspect. Drug Discov.

The specificity requirements for cleavage of such peptide bonds have not been examined, however, and as herpesvirus proteinases have been frequently described as attractive targets for the design of antiviral drugs, the present report quantifies the ability of mature HHV-6 proteinase to cleave a systematic series of synthetic peptide substrates and examines the ability of the precursor form to undergo proteolytic processing when mutations are introduced at the R- and M-sites. The gene encoding the full-length proteinase precursor from HHV-6 was generated as described previously (7Tigue N.J. Matharu P.J. Roberts N.A. Mills J.S. Kay J. Jupp R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4136-4141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced at appropriate locations using the overlapping PCR technique (9Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst .). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6812) Google Scholar). Pairs of forward and reverse mutagenesis primers (Table I) were designed to introduce the desired mutation and where possible a novel restriction site to facilitate identification of mutant clones. In the Y227A, A491G, and A491V cases (Table I), the mutations were introduced at each site by three successive polymerase chain reactions (PCR), which employed (i) the relevant forward (F) mutagenesis primer and its appropriate reverse (R2 or R4) partner oligonucleotide; (ii) the relevant reverse (R) mutagenesis primer together with its appropriate forward (F4 or F5) partner oligonucleotide; after purification of each of these initial PCR products, they were combined and used as templates in (iii) a subsequent PCR which employed the wild-type flanking oligonucleotides (e.g. R2/F5) as primers (9Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst .). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6812) Google Scholar). For the A230G, A230V, and (PR)Y227A mutants (Table I), substitutions were introduced into the appropriate wild-type gene using a single PCR followed by subcloning. For the mutants A230G and A230V, the (forward) mutagenesis oligonucleotides contained a SnaBI restriction site to facilitate subcloning into the full-length proteinase precursor gene. In only one case, termed (PR)Y227A, was a mutation introduced into a gene that encoded only the mature form of HHV-6 proteinase. In this case, the (reverse) mutagenesis primer was positioned precisely at the region of the gene encoding the C terminus of the mature proteinase and thus contained an in-frame stop codon plus a SalI restriction site for further manipulation.Table ISynthetic oligonucleotides used to introduce mutations into the HHV-6 proteinase precursor and mature proteinase genesMutation siteDirectionMutagenesis oligonucleotides (5′–3′)Partner oligonucleotideSite createdY227AFAAATGTACAGCTATTAAAGCTAGTGAAR4BsrGIRTTCACTAGCTTTAATAGCTGTACATTTF4(PR) Y227ARGTCGACTCAAGCTTTAATAGCTGTACATTTF4BsrGIA491GFTATTTTAAACGGATCCTTGGCGCCTGAAACCGR2BamHIRCGGTTTCAGGCGCCAAGGATCCGTTTAAAATAF5A491VFATTTTAAACGTTTCTTTGGCTCCGGAAACCR2AccIIIRGGTTTCCGGAGCCAAAGAAACGTTTAAAATF5A230GFGTACGTATATTAAAGGATCCGAACACCCGR2BamHIA230VFGTACGTATATTAAAGTTAGTGAACCACCGGTGR2AgeIThe sequences of the partner oligonucleotides were: F2, 5′-ATCAGACGTCGACAGCATTGATGTA-3′; F4, 5′-TCGATTTAGAGCATGGGC-3′; F5, 5′-CCGTATTCTGAGTCGGCT-3′; R2, 5′-GCGCGTCGACTTAACTATCCATTTTATTTAACGCGTCA-3′; R4, 5′-AATGGTGGACTCGACAGCA-3′.

Following verification of its nucleotide sequence, each mutated DNA fragment was subcloned into the expression vector pDS56,6His(2)Xa described previously (7Tigue N.J. Matharu P.J. Roberts N.A. Mills J.S. Kay J. Jupp R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4136-4141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Synthetic oligonucleotides were obtained from Pharmacia Biotech (St. Albans, Herts., United Kingdom (U.K.)), Genosys Technologies Ltd. (Cambridge, U.K.), or Life Technologies, Inc. (Paisley, U.K.) Wild-type and mutant constructs were transformed into the Escherichia coli strain M15, pDM1.1. Cells harboring the plasmids were grown at 28 °C until A 600 = 0.8, before induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm, final concentration). Samples were taken at various times after induction, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using separate primary antibodies, which recognized the mature HHV-6 proteinase and the assembly protein region of the precursor (Fig. 1), respectively (7Tigue N.J. Matharu P.J. Roberts N.A. Mills J.S. Kay J. Jupp R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4136-4141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antiserum as the secondary antibody allowed the detection of immunoreactive bands by the nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate method (Bio-Rad Ltd., Hemel Hempstead, Herts., UK.). Mature forms of wild-type and Y227A mutant proteinase were produced in the soluble fraction in E. coli and purified to homogeneity by nickel chelate chromatography as described previously (7Tigue N.J. Matharu P.J. Roberts N.A. Mills J.S. Kay J. Jupp R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4136-4141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Peptide substrates were synthesized on a Milligen 9050 Pepsynthesizer and purified to >95% using reverse-phase FPLC by Dr. B. K. Handa (Roche Research Center, Welwyn Garden City, Herts., UK). Accurate concentrations of peptide solutions were determined by amino acid analysis. Peptide cleavage assays were performed (unless otherwise stated) at 21 °C, in 50 μl of buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 15 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 450 μl of 5% trifluoroacetic acid. Intact substrate and cleavage products were resolved on a Pep RPC HR 5/5 reverse phase column linked to an FPLC system by means of a 0–35% linear gradient of acetonitrile containing 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid. Eluted peaks were detected at 214 nm using a Pharmacia Biotech Single Path Monitor and recorded on a Rec. 482 chart recorder (Pharmacia Biotech Ltd.), which allowed relative amounts of cleavage to be quantified by integration of the areas under the respective product/substrate peaks. A minimum of five different substrate concentrations within an appropriate range was used to generate initial rate (ν) data. The substrate concentrations ([S]) and their corresponding rates were entered into the Sysvol kinetics package (Hewlett Packard, Palo Alto, CA), which generated plots of ν versus [S] and derived values for K m and V max. The estimated errors were always less than ±15%. Values fork cat were derived from the equationV max = k cat[E]. As no effective inhibitors are available for use as active site titrants for HHV-6 (or other herpesvirus) proteinase(s), it was necessary to assume that the concentration of active proteinase was equivalent to the total protein concentration determined for each purified proteinase preparation using the Micro BCA protein assay kit (Pierce). Inspection of the HHV-6 proteinase precursor sequence (7Tigue N.J. Matharu P.J. Roberts N.A. Mills J.S. Kay J. Jupp R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4136-4141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reveals that in both of the cleavage (R and M) sites, the ∼P1*P1'∼ residues contributing to the scissile peptide bond are ∼Ala*Ser∼ (Fig. 1). Synthetic peptides mimicking the R and M cleavage sites were examined for their susceptibility to hydrolysis by recombinant, mature HHV-6 proteinase, purified to homogeneity as described previously (7Tigue N.J. Matharu P.J. Roberts N.A. Mills J.S. Kay J. Jupp R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4136-4141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetic parameters that were obtained (Table II) indicate that both peptides were readily cleaved. Comparable values for the specificity constants (k cat/K m) for each peptide were calculated when the measurements were made at 21 and 37 °C. In our preliminary study on recombinant HHV-6 proteinase (7Tigue N.J. Matharu P.J. Roberts N.A. Mills J.S. Kay J. Jupp R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4136-4141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was reported that the enzyme appeared to show little or no activity at temperatures above 21 °C. This somewhat unexpected finding was derived from using a quenched fluorescent assay system, which employed a synthetic peptide comparable to that of the R-site mimic (in Table II) but which was modified at each end with two hydrophobic, internally quenching, fluorescent groups. Assays based on such fluorescence changes are considerably more convenient in practice than the FPLC-based type that was used to derive the kinetic parameters in the present study (Table II). However, it would appear that the introduction of the two bulky fluorescent reporter groups distorted the processes of interaction between substrate and enzyme considerably, to improve the apparent value of K m by approximately 50-fold (albeit with little influence on k cat) and to prevent effective substrate cleavage above 21 °C. The convenience of such internally quenched fluorescent substrates in proteinase activity studies has been widely advocated (e.g.see Ref. 10Krafft G.A. Wang G.T. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 241: 70-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), but it is clear that such usages are not without their limitations. Consequently, for further characterization of HHV-6 proteinase, the cleavage reactions were monitored using the more laborious FPLC-based assay and at a temperature of 21 °C.Table IIKinetic parameters for the hydrolysis by mature HHV-6 proteinase of synthetic peptide substrates based on the release (R) and maturation (M) site sequencesTemperatureCleavage sitePeptideK mk catk cat/K m°Cmmminmin mm21(R)Sc-RRYIKA*SEPPV-NH20.2572837(R)Sc-RRYIKA*SEPPV-NH20.4102521(M)Sc-RRILNA*SLAPE-NH22.013637(M)Sc-RRILNA*SLAPE-NH22.82810Assays were performed at pH 8.5 and at 21 or 37 °C.

In order to establish the minimum length of peptide required for cleavage, a systematic series of peptides based on the R-site sequence was examined for their susceptibility to hydrolysis by purified, recombinant HHV-6 proteinase. The first set encompassed the P7-P5′ residues, with two arginine residues introduced into the P6′ and P7′ positions to aid solubility (peptide 1, Table III). Systematic truncation of the N-terminal side of the peptide generated a nested set of peptides, with the smallest spanning P2-P5′ (peptide 6). The equivalent set (peptides 7–10), based on the P4-P5′ residues of the HHV-6 release site, had residues removed sequentially from the C-terminal side of the scissile peptide bond, with the two arginines placed N-terminal to the scissile bond in positions P5 and P6.Table IIIKinetic parameters for the hydrolysis by mature HHV-6 proteinase of N- and C-terminally truncated peptide substrates based on the HHV-6 release site sequencePeptide no.Peptide sequenceK mk catk cat/K mmmminmin mm1 Sc-KSTYIKA*SEPPVRR-NH20.618362Sc-STYIKA*SEPPVRR-NH20.717263Sc-TYIKA*SEPPVRR-NH22.669274Sc-YIKA*SEPPVRR-NH22.591365Sc-IKA*SEPPVRR-NH26.21126Sc-KA*SEPPVRR-NH2007Sc-RRYIKA*SEPPV-NH20.257288Sc-RRYIKA*SEPP-NH20.6571019Sc-RRYIKA*SEP-NH21.1232010Sc-RRYIKA*SE-NH200Assays were performed at pH 8.5 and 21 °C.

N-terminal truncation to remove the P7 residue had little effect on the specificity constant (comparek cat/K m values for peptides 2 and 1). Similarly deletion of a residue from the P6 and P5 positions (peptides 3 and 4, respectively) did not alter the values of k cat/K m. However, this consistency in the specificity constant was maintained for peptide 3 by reciprocal improvement in k catwith an elevation in K m, compared with the values derived for peptide 2. Deletion of the P4 tyrosine (in peptide 5), however, resulted in a substantial reduction in k cat accompanied by an approximately 3-fold increase in K m, such that the specificity constant for peptide 5 was an order of magnitude lower than the values obtained for the longer peptides. Removal of the P3 substituent resulted in a peptide (peptide 6) that was no longer susceptible to cleavage by mature HHV-6 proteinase, even upon prolonged incubation. On this basis, the C-terminal truncated set of peptides was synthesized to position the two solubilizing arginine residues in the P6and P5 positions. The resultant longest peptide in this set (peptide 7) is closely similar to peptide 4, differing only in the position of the two hydrophilic arginines. Although comparablek cat/K m values were obtained with these two substrates, the K m and k cat values are virtually 10-fold different reciprocally. This implies that positioning the arginine residues on the N-terminal side of the scissile peptide bond (peptide 7) results in a substrate that binds with a better affinity to the active site of HHV-6 proteinase than when they are located at the C terminus of the peptide. Reciprocally, this results in a poorer rate of cleavage of the substrate. Consistent with this, the presence of (serine and threonine) substituents in the P6 and P5 positions (peptide 2) also lowered the value of K m that was determined (compare with peptides 3 and 4, Table III) but reduced the magnitude of the turnover number (k cat). Removal of the P5′ residue, resulting in peptide 8, improved k cat considerably with relatively little influence on the K m value, implying that valine is not a favored substituent in P5′. The value for the specificity constant for peptide 8 is the highest in the series, even though residues are present in P6 and P5. Removal of the P4′ substituent to give peptide 9 lowered the value of the specificity constant and the final peptide spanning P5-P2′ (peptide 10) was not cleaved at all. On this basis, it would appear that the minimal length for efficient hydrolysis of R-site mimics by the proteinase from HHV-6 (a β-subfamily member; see Introduction) would require a peptide spanning P4-P4′. This contrasts with the findings reported for the proteinases from the α-herpesviruses,e.g. HSV-1 and VZV (11DiIanni C.L. Mapelli C. Drier D.A. Tsao J. Natarajan S. Riexinger D. Festin S.M. Bolgar M.

Virol. 1997; 78: 2153-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), which appear to require much longer synthetic peptides, e.g. spanning P3 to P7′ for the R-site and P5 to P8′ for the M-site, for efficient substrate cleavage (11DiIanni C.L. Mapelli C. Drier D.A. Tsao J. Natarajan S. Riexinger D. Festin S.M. Bolgar M. Yamanaka G. Weinheimer S.P. Meyers C.A. Colonno R.J. Cordingley M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25449-25454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As a large effect was observed upon removal of the Tyr residue in the P4 position (peptides 4 and 5; Table II), the effect of replacement of this residue by other amino acids was investigated (Table IV). Substitution by Asp, Lys, Nle (which corresponds to lysine without its ε-NH2 group) or Ile (the equivalent P4 residue in the M-site sequence; Fig. 1 and the lower peptide in Table II) all resulted in specificity constants that were lowered by at least two orders of magnitude compared with the parent peptide (Table IV). The Tyr residue at P4 would thus appear to be of crucial importance with regard to R-site cleavage.Table IVKinetic parameters for the hydrolysis by mature HHV-6 proteinase of the synthetic peptide succinyl-Arg-Arg-P4-Ile-Lys-Ala*Ser-Glu-Pro-Pro-NH2with systematic variations in the P4 residueP4substituentK mk catk cat/K mmmminmin mmTyrosine0.657101Isoleucine4.21.50.4Norleucine3.81.20.3Aspartate1.80.50.3Lysine0Values were measured at pH 8.5 and 21 °C. Open table in a new tab Values were measured at pH 8.5 and 21 °C. In order to investigate this further, this Tyr residue (Tyr227; Fig. 1) was mutated to an Ala within the context of the gene encoding the 528-residue proteinase precursor, and the ability of the mutated proteinase precursor to undergo autoprocessing in E. coli was compared with that of the wild-type gene product (Fig. 2). Samples were removed at different time points and analyzed by Western blotting using two distinct HHV-6 antisera in order to visualize products derived from the proteinase (upper panels) and assembly protein (lower panels), respectively. Processing of the wild-type precursor at both R and M cleavage sites to release the assembly protein and generate the mature form of HHV-6 proteinase was completed between 30 and 60 min (Fig. 2, panel i). However, in the case of the Y227A mutant proteinase precursor, the band at ∼65 kDa, which is consistent in size with that predicted for the full-length proteinase precursor (see Fig. 1), persisted throughout the time course (Fig. 2, panel ii). Furthermore, the absence of any band corresponding to mature HHV-6 proteinase (compare upper panels ii and i in Fig. 2) suggests that mutation of Tyr227 to Ala rendered the R-site resistant to cleavage. In attempts to make this comparison more quantitative and to gain some insight into the significance of Tyr227 in proteinase function, the gene encoding the mature form (i.e. residues 1–230; see Fig. 1) of the Y227A mutant proteinase was subcloned and expressed in E. coli. The resultant, mutant proteinase accumulated in the soluble fraction in E. coli, from where it was purified to homogeneity (as described previously (7Tigue N.J. Matharu P.J. Roberts N.A. Mills J.S. Kay J. Jupp R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4136-4141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) for the wild-type enzyme). The ability was assessed of this Y227A mutant proteinase to hydrolyze the two synthetic peptides (described in Table II), which mimicked the wild-type R and M cleavage junctions. No cleavage of either substrate was detected, even upon prolonged incubation of each peptide with a large amount of the recombinant, Y227A mutant proteinase. Thus, within the context of the amino acid sequence of the R-site, a tyrosine residue at P4 appears to be necessary in order to achieve effective cleavage of synthetic peptide substrates (Table IV) and the proteinase precursor itself (Fig. 2, panel ii). This suggests that the tyrosine residue must be accessible for recognition by the attacking catalyst. As the mature Y227A mutant proteinase was readily soluble when accumulating to high concentration in E. coli, it is unlikely to have been grossly misfolded as a consequence of the loss of the phenol ring resulting from the Tyr → Ala mutation. The purified, mutant enzyme was inactive, however. The simplest explanation for these observations is that, following cleavage of the extended sequence of the R-site in the proteinase precursor, the tyrosine side chain is important for proper incorporation of this C-terminal region into the correct structure of the newly generated mature proteinase. The human herpesvirus-6 proteinase is not exceptional, however, in having a Tyr residue in this location. Inspection of the R and M cleavage junctions in the proteinase precursors of other herpesviruses reveals that a Tyr residue is always present at the P4 position of the R-site sequence (7Tigue N.J. Matharu P.J. Roberts N.A. Mills J.S. Kay J. Jupp R. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4136-4141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) but is never seen at the equivalent location in the M-site.

The equivalent residue in HCMV proteinase to Tyr227 in the HHV-6 sequence is Tyr253, which is also positioned at the P4 location relative to the C-terminal Ala residue generated upon R-site cleavage. The crystal structure of the mature form of HCMV proteinase indicates that the side chain of Tyr253 is positioned in a hydrophobic pocket with its phenolic OH group making a hydrogen-bond with the main-chain carbonyl oxygen atom of Gln116 (16Tong L. Qian C. Massariol M.-J. Bonneau P.R. Cordingley M.G. Lagacé L. Nature. 1996; 383: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Attempts to model HHV-6 proteinase on the basis of its homology to HCMV proteinase are complicated by several regions of uncertainty in which residues are deleted in the respective sequences. Relevant segments are given in Structure 1. 95 100 227 230‖‖‖‖HHV­6:∼GSVIEPLPPD∼∼GL—SKCTYIKAHCMV:∼GPV­SPLQPD∼∼GVTERESYVKA‖‖‖‖ 110 116 246 253STRUCTURE 1These indicate (i) a deletion in the HHV-6 sequence just before Tyr227, and (ii) a deletion in the HCMV sequence four residues upstream from Gln116 (HCMV numbering), which (iii) is itself replaced by Pro100 in HHV-6 proteinase. These alterations, which occur in loops (16Tong L. Qian C. Massariol M.-J. Bonneau P.R. Cordingley M.G. Lagacé L. Nature. 1996; 383: 272-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) make modeling exercises imprecise, but it does appear that the residues in HCMV proteinase that line the hydrophobic pocket are likely to be retained in character in the HHV-6 sequence. Thus, it would seem that Tyr227 in HHV-6 proteinase may also be accommodated within a hydrophobic pocket and may well form a hydrogen bond through its phenolic OH group, but the precise nature of such contacts and the relative orientation of the side chains requires definition by determination of a crystal structure for HHV-6 proteinase.

In keeping with this, the ∼P1*P1′∼ scissile peptide bond at both R and M cleavage sites in the HHV-6 proteinase precursor was found to be between small ∼Ala*Ser∼ residues. In order to investigate further the significance of the nature of the P1 substituent, a series of synthetic peptides was prepared based on the R-site sequence, in which the P1 Ala residue was replaced. Kinetic parameters were determined for the hydrolysis of each of these by purified, mature wild-type HHV-6 proteinase (Table V). Replacement of the P1 Ala by a smaller glycine residue (i.e. with no side chain; peptide 11, Table V) still allowed cleavage of the peptide, but thek cat/K m value was reduced by about half compared with that of the parent peptide (peptide 7, Table V). When the P1 substituent was a hydrophilic Ser (peptide 12) or a bulkier, β-branched Val residue (peptide 13, Table V), cleavage of the respective peptides was severely reduced and, in the case of the P1 Val substituent, appeared to be abrogated altogether.Table VKinetic parameters for hydrolysis by mature HHV-6 proteinase of synthetic peptide substrates varying in the P1 residuePeptide no.K mk catk cat/K mmmminmin mm7Sc-RRYIKA*SEPPV-NH20.2572811Sc-RRYIKG*SEPPV-NH22.024128Sc-RRYIKA*SEPP-NH20.65710112Sc-RRYIKS*SEPP-NH2∼0∼013Sc-RRYIKV*SEPP-NH200Assays were performed at pH 8.5 and at 21 °C. Open table in a new tab Assays were performed at pH 8.5 and at 21 °C. These effects were examined further by introducing Gly or Val in place of the P1 Ala230 and Ala491residues at the R and M cleavage sites, respectively, in the proteinase precursor (Fig. 1) and comparing the processing events in these mutant proteinase precursors with those observed upon expression of the wild-type precursor gene in E. coli. For the wild-type, M-site cleavage was complete by about 30 min (Fig. 2, panel i) with processing at the R-site in the precursor apparently requiring a little longer (approximately 60 min). For the R-site mutants, processing of the A230G mutant proteinase precursor at the non-mutated M-site appeared to proceed comparably to that of the wild-type precursor (data not shown). However, whereas in the wild-type case, conversion to mature proteinase by cleavage at the R-site was complete by about 60 min (Fig. 2, panel i), the autoconversion reaction was only just beginning after 120 min with the A230G mutant precursor (data not shown). Introduction of a Gly residue, therefore, in place of the natural P1 Ala substituent appeared to impede but did not prevent autoprocessing. These events were even more apparent in the case of the A230V mutant proteinase precursor. Even after 120 min, no 28-kDa band of mature HHV-6 proteinase could be detected (compare Fig. 2, top panels iii and i), indicating that correct processing at the ∼Val*Ser∼ mutant R-site had not occurred. Other bands were evident, however (e.g. at ∼56 and 52 kDa, respectively, as revealed particularly by the antiserum specific for the assembly protein region; see Fig. 2, lower panel iii), which cannot be accounted for by cleavage at either or both of the R and M cleavage sites. These same bands appeared nonspecifically in the case of the Y227A mutant proteinase precursor (Fig. 2, panel ii). During expression of the wild-type precursor, these bands were faintly evident after about 10 min but appeared only transiently and were not detected in the later time points when mature proteinase was accumulating. In contrast, when the gene encoding only the mature form of HHV-6 proteinase was expressed, these protein bands were not detected at all (data not shown). This evidence confirms that the proteins being revealed were not E. coli proteins that chanced to react nonspecifically with the antisera being used, but were indeed derived from the HHV-6 proteinase precursor. As these intermediate proteins persisted only when mutant proteinase precursor genes (e.g.Y227A, A230V) were being expressed and reciprocally, when the mature form of HHV-6 proteinase was NOT being generated, it would seem that these proteins of intermediate size may have been produced by the nonspecific action of E. coli proteinase(s). If active,mature HHV-6 proteinase was being generated simultaneously, then the viral proteinase eventually processed these products and their accumulation was thus prevented. In the cases of the mutant proteinase precursors where mature HHV-6 enzyme was not being generated, then there was no intrinsic ability to process these intermediates and they thus persisted throughout the time course. Consistent with this interpretation, when the mutations A491G or A491V were introduced at the M-site (Fig. 1), the intermediate proteins were visible only faintly and transiently. Mature HHV-6 proteinase did accumulate, with processing at the (wild-type) R-site being essentially complete in approximately 60 min in the case of the A491G mutant (not shown) and by 120 min for the A491V mutant (Fig. 2, top panel iv). Relative to wild-type, the proteinase precursor band at 65 kDa seemed to persist until later time points (compare top panels i and iv in Fig. 2), suggesting that processing events at the R-site might have been delayed to a minor extent. In contrast, however, the efficiency of processing at the mutated ∼Val491*Ser492 ∼ M-site in the A491V mutant proteinase precursor was considerably diminished (Fig. 2,lower panel iv). The ∼36 kDa form of the assembly protein region (which had not undergone M-site cleavage) appeared to be the predominant product derived from the C terminus of the precursor and had undergone little processing even after 120 min (Fig. 2, compare panels iv and i). From these data, it would appear that processing of the M-site is not a prerequisite for cleavage of the R-site in the proteinase precursor. These investigations have revealed that, in addition to the P4 Tyr residue discussed earlier, a P1Ala residue is preferable for hydrolysis of peptide substrates (Table V) and for efficiency of autoprocessing of the proteinase precursor. Cleavage of the precursor at the R-site requires that the ∼Ala230*Ser231 bond is accessible and thus it is unlikely that Ala230 (and the P4 residue of Tyr227) are accommodated in the proteinase precursor in the same orientation as their side chains finally adopt in the mature HHV-6 enzyme. Thus, if this C-terminal region (containing these critical Tyr227 and Ala230 residues), which is newly generated as a result of the processing events, can be prevented from folding into its correct juxtaposition with the remainder of the mature proteinase, then this might offer a strategy for the design of inhibitors that would abrogate precursor processing and disrupt the herpes viral life cycle.

W., Conaway, R. C., and Conaway, J. W. (1993) <i>J. Biol. Chem.</i> 268, 25587–25593). In this report, we present evidence that stimulation of elongation by Elongin requires that the early RNA polymerase II elongation complex undergoes conversion to an Elongin-activable form. We observe (i) that Elongin does not detectably stimulate the rate of promoter-specific transcription initiation by the fully assembled preinitiation complex and (ii) that early RNA polymerase II elongation intermediates first become susceptible to stimulation by Elongin after synthesizing 8–9-nucleotide-long transcripts. Furthermore, we show that the relative inability of Elongin to stimulate elongation by early elongation intermediates correlates not with the lengths of their associated transcripts but, instead, with the presence of transcription factor IIF (TFIIF) in transcription reactions. By exploiting adenovirus 2 major late promoter derivatives that contain premelted transcriptional start sites and do not require TFIIF, TFIIE, or TFIIH for transcription initiation, we observe (i) that Elongin is capable of strongly stimulating the rate of synthesis of trinucleotide transcripts by a subcomplex of RNA polymerase II, TBP, and TFIIB and (ii) that the ability of Elongin to stimulate synthesis of these short transcripts is substantially reduced by addition of TFIIF to transcription reactions. Here we present these findings, which are consistent with the model that maximal stimulation of elongation by Elongin requires that early elongation intermediates undergo a structural transition that includes loss of TFIIF."
https://openalex.org/W1968149813,"The stalk region of the H+-ATPase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been proposed to play a role in coupling ATP hydrolysis to proton transport. Genetic probing was used to examine the role of stalk segments S2 and S3, associated with M2 and M3, respectively. Saturation mutagenesis was used to explore the role of side group character at position Ile183 in S2, at which an alanine substitution was shown previously to partially uncouple the enzyme (Wang, G., Tamas, M. J., Hall, M. J., Pascual-Ahuir, A., and Perlin, D. S. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 25438-25445). Diverse side group substitutions were tolerated at this position, although three substitutions, I183N, I183R, and I183Y required second site mutations at the C terminus of the enzyme for stabilization. Substitution of glycine and proline at Ile183 resulted in lethal phenotypes, suggesting that the backbone may be more important than side group at this position. Proline/glycine mutagenesis was used to study additional sites in S2 and S3. The substitution of proline at Gly186 resulted in a lethal phenotype, whereas substitutions in S3 of proline or serine at Gly270 and proline or glycine at Thr287 resulted in viable mutants. Mutations G270P and T287P resulted in mutant enzymes that produced pronounced growth defects and ATP hydrolysis rates that were 35% and 60% lower than wild type enzyme, respectively. The mutant enzymes transported protons at rates consistent with their ATPase activity, suggesting that the growth defects observed were due to a reduced rate of ATP hydrolysis and not to uncoupling of proton transport. The prominent growth phenotypes produced by mutations G270P and T287P permitted the isolation of suppressor mutations, which restored wild type growth. Most of the suppressors either replaced the primary site mutation with alanine or restored the wild type residue by ectopic recombination with PMA2, both of which restore alpha-helical tendency. This study suggests that maintaining alpha-helical character is essential to S2 and may play an important role in S3."
https://openalex.org/W2002796811,"The heterodimeric subunits of deoxyadenosine kinase (dAK)-deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) from Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26 exhibit contrasting conformations manifested in the nearly unidirectional heterotropic activation of dAK when dGK binds deoxyguanosine. This is mediated, in part, by the conserved Ras switch I-like sequence (residues 153–161) [Guo et al. (1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 6890–6897]. In an attempt to identify domains differentiating the specificities of dAK and dGK, we constructed several chimeras splicing heterodimeric dAK within this region. In Chimera-III, dAK residues 120–170 were replaced by the homologous section of dGK. dAK activity was elevated 40%, but although it retained its original specificity and K m values, it could no longer be activated by deoxyguanosine. Moreover, both the activated dAK and the “dAK” of Chimera-III exhibited (i) an increased K s for the leading substrate ATP-Mg2+, suggesting the formation of intermediate enzyme species along their respective kinetic pathways, and (ii) broadened and lower pH optima for the dAK activities. These observations further indicate the importance of dAK residues 120–170, including the Ras-like segment, in catalysis and heterotropic activation. The other conformational properties of dAK (e.g. self-inactivity and MgATP being the leading substrate) were unaltered by this substitution, thus localizing the responsible domains even further upstream. The heterodimeric subunits of deoxyadenosine kinase (dAK)-deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) from Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26 exhibit contrasting conformations manifested in the nearly unidirectional heterotropic activation of dAK when dGK binds deoxyguanosine. This is mediated, in part, by the conserved Ras switch I-like sequence (residues 153–161) [Guo et al. (1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 6890–6897]. In an attempt to identify domains differentiating the specificities of dAK and dGK, we constructed several chimeras splicing heterodimeric dAK within this region. In Chimera-III, dAK residues 120–170 were replaced by the homologous section of dGK. dAK activity was elevated 40%, but although it retained its original specificity and K m values, it could no longer be activated by deoxyguanosine. Moreover, both the activated dAK and the “dAK” of Chimera-III exhibited (i) an increased K s for the leading substrate ATP-Mg2+, suggesting the formation of intermediate enzyme species along their respective kinetic pathways, and (ii) broadened and lower pH optima for the dAK activities. These observations further indicate the importance of dAK residues 120–170, including the Ras-like segment, in catalysis and heterotropic activation. The other conformational properties of dAK (e.g. self-inactivity and MgATP being the leading substrate) were unaltered by this substitution, thus localizing the responsible domains even further upstream. thymidine kinase deoxyadenosine kinase deoxyguanosine kinase deoxycytidine kinase deoxyadenosine deoxyguanosine Chimera polymerase chain reaction herpes simplex virus GTPase-activating protein. Lactobacillus acidophilus R-26 lacks a functional ribonucleotide reductase and thus depends on its four salvage deoxynucleoside kinases, each of which is highly specific, for the synthesis of DNA precursors. Whereas the thymidine kinase (TK)1 of cell extracts is readily separable from the other three kinase activities (1Durham J.P. Ives D.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1971; 228: 9-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), the deoxyadenosine kinase peptide must be associated with either deoxyguanosine kinase (dAK-dGK) or the deoxycytidine kinase (dAK-dCK) (2Deibel Jr., M.R.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13373-13381Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) reveal conformational changes occurring near the intersubunit contact during heterotropic activation. A directed mutation within the Ras switch I-like sequence of dAK changing the structurally important Pro-155 residue to alanine permanently cis-activates dAK halfway toward its maximal activity potential, with a corresponding reduction in the magnitude of the heterotropic trans-activation by dGuo (6Guo S.

Studies of comparable Ras-RasGAP interactions have shown switch I to be at the protein-protein interface, being a part of the Ras GTPase active site (15Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M.R. Kabsch W.

By analogy, the Ras-like sequence of dAK is probably part of the dAK active site, being clearly involved in dAK-dGK intersubunit communication, specifically in heterotropic activation. It should be noted that unlike the Lactobacillus kinases, those human kinases do not possess the Ras switch I-like sequence. Instead, just after the arginine-rich site, they have a leucine-rich sequence that is thought to be involved in subunit-subunit interaction (16Eriksson S. Wang L.Y. Nucleosides Nucleotides. 1997; 16: 653-659Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar), although there is as yet no direct evidence for this.To understand the structural bases for the contrasting properties of dAK and dGK (or dCK), we constructed chimeras in this study in attempts to convert dAK into dGK. Although a comparison of primary sequences can implicate important motifs, in the absence of x-ray resolution, it is difficult to predict the actual size of a domain precisely. We therefore chose three splicing sites 50 residues apart, dividing the polypeptide into four nearly equal segments. Chimera III (Chi-III or “dAK”-dGK), with a segment of peptide from residues 120–170 on dAK replaced by its counterpart from dGK, is of particular interest. Upon such a transplant, the dAK activity was elevated about 40%, whereas its heterotropic response toward dGuo was abolished. Both “dAK” of Chi-III and heterotropically activated dAK had their pH optima reduced from pH 9.3 to around pH 8. Moreover, the chimeric “dAK” began to behave more like dGK in terms of a lower affinity for MgATP. Despite this, “dAK” remained inactive when expressed without dGK.
