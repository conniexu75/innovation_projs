https://openalex.org/W2065991187,"Active autophagy coupled with rapid mitochondrial fusion and fission constitutes an important mitochondrial quality control mechanism and is critical to cellular health. In our previous studies, we found that exposure of cells to nicotinamide causes a decrease in mitochondrial content and an increase in mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) by activating autophagy and inducing mitochondrial fragmentation. Here, we present evidence to show that the effect of nicotinamide is mediated through an increase of the [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio and the activation of SIRT1, an NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase that plays a role in autophagy flux. The [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio was inversely correlated with the mitochondrial content, and an increase in the ratio by the mobilization of the malate-aspartate shuttle resulted in autophagy activation and mitochondrial transformation from lengthy filaments to short dots. Furthermore, treatment of cells with SIRT1 activators, fisetin or SRT1720, induced similar changes in the mitochondrial content. Importantly, the activators induced mitochondrial fragmentation only when SIRT1 expression was intact. Meanwhile, MMP did not increase when the cells were treated with the activators, suggesting that the change in MMP is not induced by the mitochondrial turnover per se and that elevation of the [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio may activate additional mechanisms that cause MMP augmentation. Together, our results indicate that a metabolic state resulting in an elevated [NAD(+)]/[NADH] ratio can modulate mitochondrial quantity and quality via pathways that may include SIRT1-mediated mitochondrial autophagy."
https://openalex.org/W2040593216,"TRPV1 receptor agonists such as the vanilloid capsaicin and the potent analog resiniferatoxin are well known potent analgesics. Depending on the vanilloid, dose, and administration site, nociceptor refractoriness may last from minutes up to months, suggesting the contribution of different cellular mechanisms ranging from channel receptor desensitization to Ca(2+) cytotoxicity of TRPV1-expressing neurons. The molecular mechanisms underlying agonist-induced TRPV1 desensitization and/or tachyphylaxis are still incompletely understood. Here, we report that prolonged exposure of TRPV1 to agonists induces rapid receptor endocytosis and lysosomal degradation in both sensory neurons and recombinant systems. Agonist-induced receptor internalization followed a clathrin- and dynamin-independent endocytic route, triggered by TRPV1 channel activation and Ca(2+) influx through the receptor. This process appears strongly modulated by PKA-dependent phosphorylation. Taken together, these findings indicate that TRPV1 agonists induce long-term receptor down-regulation by modulating the expression level of the channel through a mechanism that promotes receptor endocytosis and degradation and lend support to the notion that cAMP signaling sensitizes nociceptors through several mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W1979880836,"The transient kinetic behavior of enzyme reactions prior to the establishment of steady state is a major source of mechanistic information, yet this approach has not been utilized for cellulases acting on their natural substrate, insoluble cellulose. Here, we elucidate the pre-steady-state regime for the exo-acting cellulase Cel7A using amperometric biosensors and an explicit model for processive hydrolysis of cellulose. This analysis allows the identification of a pseudo-steady-state period and quantification of a processivity number as well as rate constants for the formation of a threaded enzyme complex, processive hydrolysis, and dissociation, respectively. These kinetic parameters elucidate limiting factors in the cellulolytic process. We concluded, for example, that Cel7A cleaves about four glycosidic bonds/s during processive hydrolysis. However, the results suggest that stalling the processive movement and low off-rates result in a specific activity at pseudo-steady state that is 10-25-fold lower. It follows that the dissociation of the enzyme-substrate complex (half-time of ~30 s) is rate-limiting for the investigated system. We suggest that this approach can be useful in attempts to unveil fundamental reasons for the distinctive variability in hydrolytic activity found in different cellulase-substrate systems."
https://openalex.org/W1963559205,"Genetic and molecular studies suggest that activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1), a transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) type I receptor, and endoglin, a TGF-β co-receptor, play an essential role in vascular development and pathological angiogenesis. Several agents that interfere with ALK1 and endoglin function are currently in clinical trials for antiangiogenic activity in cancer therapy. One of these agents, PF-03446962 (anti-hALK1 antibody), shows promising results in the clinic. However, its effects on endothelial cell function and mechanism of action are unclear. Here we demonstrate that anti-hALK1 antibody selectively recognizes human ALK1. The anti-hALK1 antibody interfered with bone morphogenetic protein 9 (BMP9)-induced signaling in endothelial cells. Consistent with this notion, anti-hALK1 antibody was found to compete highly efficiently with the binding of the ALK1 ligand BMP9 and TGF-β to ALK1. Moreover, it prevented BMP9-dependent recruitment of co-receptor endoglin into this angiogenesis-mediating signaling complex. In addition, we demonstrated that anti-hALK1 antibody inhibited endothelial cell sprouting but did not directly interfere with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling, VEGF-induced proliferation, and migration of endothelial cells. Finally, we demonstrated that BMP9 in serum is essential for endothelial sprouting and that anti-hALK1 antibody inhibits this potently. Our data suggest that both the VEGF/VEGF receptor and the BMP9/ALK1 pathways are essential for stimulating angiogenesis, and targeting both pathways simultaneously may be an attractive strategy to overcome resistance to antiangiogenesis therapy.

https://openalex.org/W2076250658,"Adherens junctions (AJs) are essential for cell-cell contacts, morphogenesis, and the development of all higher eukaryotes. AJs are formed by calcium-dependent homotypic interactions of the ectodomains of single membrane-pass cadherin family receptors. These homotypic interactions in turn promote binding of the intracellular cytoplasmic tail domains of cadherin receptors with β-catenin, a multifunctional protein that plays roles in both transcription and AJs. The cadherin receptor-β-catenin complex binds to the cytoskeletal protein α-catenin, which is essential for both the formation and the stabilization of these junctions. Precisely how α-catenin contributes to the formation and stabilization of AJs is hotly debated, although the latter is thought to involve its interactions with the cytoskeletal protein vinculin. Here we report the crystal structure of the vinculin binding domain (VBD) of α-catenin in complex with the vinculin head domain (Vh1). This structure reveals that α-catenin is in a unique unfurled mode allowing dimer formation when bound to vinculin. Finally, binding studies suggest that vinculin must be in an activated state to bind to α-catenin and that this interaction is stabilized by the formation of a ternary α-catenin-vinculin-F-actin complex, which can be formed via the F-actin binding domain of either protein. We propose a feed-forward model whereby α-catenin-vinculin interactions promote their binding to the actin cytoskeleton to stabilize AJs.

We propose a feed-forward model whereby α-catenin-vinculin interactions promote their binding to the actin cytoskeleton to stabilize AJs. Cell-cell contacts require the formation and stabilization of multiprotein cell membrane complexes coined adherens junctions (AJs). 2The abbreviations used are:AJadherens junction4HBfour-helix bundleFABDF-actin binding domainLSlight scatteringVBSvinculin binding siteVBDvinculin binding domainVHvinculin headVh1first vinculin head domainVtvinculin tail domain. These complexes are directed by homotypic interactions of single-pass transmembrane receptors (cadherins) that have tandem calcium binding ectodomains and short but functionally critical intracellular tail domains (1.Braga V.M. Balda M.S. Regulation of cell-cell adhesion.Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 2004; 15: 631-632Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cadherin interactions promote interactions of their tail domains with β-catenin, an oncoprotein that both functions as a component of AJs and regulates the activity of the T-cell transcription factor (TCF) family of transcription factors (2.Pokutta S. Weis W.I. The cytoplasmic face of cell contact sites.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 3.Clevers H.

Interestingly, the cadherin-β-catenin complex is hardwired as they bind to one another immediately following their synthesis and are co-transported to the cell membrane as a nascent complex (4.Wahl 3rd, J.K. Kim Y.J. Cullen J.M. Johnson K.R. Wheelock M.J. N-cadherin-catenin complexes form prior to cleavage of the proregion and transport to the plasma membrane.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17269-17276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Once there, β-catenin binds to the cytoskeletal protein α-catenin to form the functional ternary cadherin-β-catenin-α-catenin complex, and all three components are required for development and tissue homeostasis (5.Haegel H.

Stabilization of AJs had long been thought to rely on the interaction of this ternary complex with F-actin, where increased pools of α-catenin at nascent junctions lead to the formation of α-catenin homodimers that bind to F-actin via a C-terminal domain (9.Pokutta S. Drees F. Takai Y. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I. Biochemical and structural definition of the l-afadin- and actin-binding sites of α-catenin.J. Biol.

However, the isolated ternary complex, or these complexes in the context of isolated cell membranes, cannot bind to F-actin (11.Drees F. Pokutta S. Yamada S. Nelson W.J.

Further, in these experimental systems, F-actin binding of the ternary complex is not restored by the addition of the cytoskeletal proteins vinculin or α-actinin that themselves can bind to F-actin (2.Pokutta S. Weis W.I. The cytoplasmic face of cell contact sites.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2002; 12: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Rather, the function of the ternary AJ complex was suggested to impair the activity of the F-actin nucleating, branching Arp2/3 complex (13.Weis W.I. Nelson W.J.

Finally, to add more complexity, other α-catenin binding partners, specifically Eplin (15.Abe K. Takeichi M.

The crystal structure of the N terminus of α-catenin, and of this domain (residues 57–264) in complex with an α-helix of β-catenin, revealed that this region is a homodimer composed of two antiparallel four-helix bundle domains and that β-catenin binds to α-catenin via a helix exchange mechanism (20.Pokutta S.

In addition, the crystal structure of the “M (modulation) fragment” (residues 377–633) (9.Pokutta S. Drees F. Takai Y. Nelson W.J. Weis W.I.

Crystal structure of the M-fragment of α-catenin: implications for modulation of cell adhesion.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3645-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), which harbors the binding site for l-afadin, established that this domain is composed of a tandem repeat of two antiparallel four-helix bundles that also form a homodimer and are similar in structure, as found in the N terminus of α-catenin. Vinculin is a dynamic 117-kDa globular protein composed of five helix bundle domains that are held in a closed conformation via hydrophobic interactions of the N-terminal seven-helix bundle head (first vinculin head domain, Vh1) with the five-helix bundle tail (vinculin tail domain, Vt) (22.Izard T. Evans G. Borgon R.A. Rush C.L. Bricogne G. Bois P.R.

Crystal structure of human vinculin.Structure. 2004; 12: 1189-1197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). These intramolecular interactions are severed by the binding of amphipathic α-helix vinculin binding sites (VBS) of talin or α-actinin to the N-terminal seven-helix bundle domain of vinculin, which bury into the four-helix bundle subdomain of Vh1 to form an entirely new five-helix bundle by a mechanism coined helix bundle conversion (22.Izard T. Evans G. Borgon R.A. Rush C.L. Bricogne G. Bois P.R. Vinculin activation by talin through helical bundle conversion.Nature. 2004; 427: 171-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Binding of these VBSs to vinculin first requires that they unravel from their buried positions in the helix bundles of talin or α-actinin, which is provoked by mechanical stress (24.Ylänne J. Scheffzek K. Young P. Saraste M. Crystal structure of the α-actinin rod reveals an extensive torsional twist.Structure. 2001; 9: 597-604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 25.del Rio A.

Stretching single talin rod molecules activates vinculin binding.Science. 2009; 323: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar). Given the reported roles of vinculin in stabilizing AJs via its interactions with α-catenin (26.Lecuit T. α-Catenin mechanosensing for adherens junctions.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 522-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we solved the crystal structure of the vinculin Vh1 domain in complex with the vinculin binding domain (VBD) of α-catenin at 2.7 Å resolution. Remarkably, this structure reveals a novel mechanism of helix bundle interactions where α-catenin is bound to vinculin in an unfurled state allowing dimerization. Furthermore, this structure and binding studies support a model whereby simultaneous binding to F-actin functions to stabilize vinculin-α-catenin interactions and AJs. α-Catenin (Open Biosystems; residues 82–906 and 144–906) was cloned into the pET24b expression vector (Novagen) using NheI and NotI restriction enzyme sites with an engineered proline residue at the end of the C terminus to obtain C-terminal hexahistidine-tagged proteins. The VBD (residues 277–382) was cloned into pGEX-6P-1 (BamHI/XhoI) (GE Healthcare) to result in precision protease-cleavable GST-tagged fusion protein. α-Catenin (residues 82–634 and 263–634) (NdeI/NotI) was cloned into a modified pET28 expression vector (Novagen) to obtain precision protease-cleavable N-terminal His8-tagged proteins. The Vh1-Vt chimera (residues 1–258 and 848–1066) was obtained through single-step cloning of the Vh1 and Vt domains into a modified pET28 vector to have an N-terminal His8-tagged protein. The individual Vh1 and Vt domains were obtained through PCR by using full-length vinculin cDNA as the template, having NdeI/BamHI and BamHI/NotI restriction sites at their 5′ and 3′ end, respectively. Subsequently, both the fragments were digested by restriction endonucleases, mixed with the NdeI/NotI-treated modified pET28 vector, and ligated to obtain the final plasmid containing the DNA encoding the Vh1-Vt chimera. All constructs were verified by sequencing. Full-length vinculin (residues 1–1066), vinculin head (VH) (1–843), Vt (879–1066), and Vh1 (1–252) were generated as described (23.Borgon R.A. Vonrhein C.

Expressed proteins were purified using a HisTrap chelating nickel affinity column (GE Healthcare) and eluted over a gradient to 500 mm imidazole. Affinity tags were not cleaved for α-catenin 82–906 and 144–906 constructs. Further purification was performed on a Superdex 200 (GE Healthcare) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm DTT and concentrated to about 25 mg/ml. For crystallizations, cell pellets of His-tagged Vh1 and GST-tagged α-catenin VBD were lysed together in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 150 mm NaCl and purified on a GST-Sepharose column (GE Healthcare). The complex was eluted with 15 mm reduced glutathione, GST cleaved with PreScission protease in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm DTT, reloaded onto a GST-Sepharose column to remove the cleaved GST, and further purified on a preparative Superdex-200 26/60 column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mm Tris-HCl and 150 mm NaCl.

Open table in a new tab Light scattering (LS) data were collected by size exclusion chromatography using a Superdex 200, 10/300, HR column (GE Healthcare) that was connected to an Agilent 1200 high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Agilent Technologies, Wilmington, DE) equipped with an autosampler. Elution was monitored using a photodiode array UV-visible detector (Agilent Technologies), a differential refractometer (OptiLab rEx, Wyatt Technology Corp., Santa Barbara, CA) and static and dynamic, multiangle laser LS detector (HELEOS II with Quasi-Elastic-Light-Scattering capability, Wyatt Technology). The size exclusion chromatography-UV/LS/refractive index system was equilibrated in 20 mm Tris (pH 8) and 150 mm NaCl, with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. For data collection and analysis, two software packages were used. The ChemStation software (Agilent Technologies) controlled the operation of the HPLC and data collection from the UV-visible detector, whereas the ASTRA software (Wyatt Technology) was used for data collection from the refractive index and LS detectors and to record the 280-nm UV trace from the photodiode array detector. ASTRA software was used to determine the weight average molecular masses across the entire elution profile in 1-s intervals from static LS measurements as described (36.Folta-Stogniew E. Williams K.R. Determination of molecular masses of proteins in solution: implementation of an HPLC size exclusion chromatography and laser light scattering service in a core laboratory.J. Biomol. Tech. 1999; 10: 51-63PubMed Google Scholar). All binding studies were performed in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm DTT. VH-Vt or VH-α-catenin (82–906, 82–634, or 263–634) complexes were obtained by incubating equimolar amounts (15 μm) of proteins for 10 min at room temperature. Complexes were then incubated with Vt or α-catenin, respectively, at equimolar and 5-fold excess concentration for an additional 10 min. The samples were analyzed by PhastGel using native PhastGel buffer strips (homogeneous 20% for Fig. 4, C–E or 10–15% gradient for Figs. 4, A and B, and 5) and stained with Coomassie Blue. Similarly, VBS (residues 332–353) was added to preformed Vh1-Vt complexes at 5-fold excess concentration. F-actin pulldown assays were carried out as described (37.Bois P.R. O'Hara B.P.

The addition of α-catenin (residues 82–906, 20 μm, lane 2), α-cateninΔFABD (residues 82–634, 20 μm, lane 4), or α-catenin 263–634 (20 μm, lane 6) to the Vh1-Vt chimera (residues 1–258 and 848–1066, 15 μm) lacking the Vt2 domain results in α-catenin-vinculin complex formation (indicated by asterisks). Binding in each case was saturable with no unbound α-catenin remaining. C, the α-cateninΔFABD-vinculin complex binds F-actin via Vt. Left gel, lanes 1 and 2, F-actin is found in the pellet (P).

We determined the α-catenin VBD as residues 277–382 based on secondary structure analyses and homology model prediction (42.Kelley L.A. Sternberg M.J.

The crystals belong to the orthorhombic space group P21212 with unit cell dimensions of a = 57.2 Å, b = 73.9 Å, and c = 107.4 Å (Table 1) with one heterodimer in the asymmetric unit (Z = 4) resulting in a solvent content of 59% and a crystal volume per unit of protein molecular weight, VM (43.Matthews B.W. Solvent content of protein crystals.J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7917) Google Scholar), of 3.03 Å3/Da. The Vh1-VBD structure was determined to 2.7 Å resolution. The regions corresponding to Vh1 residues 219–222 and α-catenin 277–289 were not modeled due to lack of discernible electron density, and although the electron density for α-catenin residues 354–361 is weak, the connectivity is unambiguous (supplemental Fig. S1). The final model comprises one Vh1-VBD, nine acetates, and 82 water molecules with a crystallographic and free R-factor of 0.19 and 0.23, respectively (Table 1). All residues fall in allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot as calculated by MolProbity (44.Chen V.B. Arendall 3rd, W.B. Headd J.J. Keedy D.A. Immormino R.M. Kapral G.J. Murray L.W. Richardson J.S.

The structure of the Vh1 domain of vinculin when bound to α-catenin resembles that of other VBS-bound Vh1 structures (supplemental Fig. S2A) where the two four-helix bundle (4HB) subdomains are connected by one centrally shared α-helix (α4) (Fig. 1A).

https://openalex.org/W2089739590,"Podocyte injury resulting from a loss of differentiation is the hallmark of many glomerular diseases. We previously showed that retinoic acid (RA) induces podocyte differentiation via stimulation of the cAMP pathway. However, many podocyte maturity markers lack binding sites for RA-response element or cAMP-response element (CREB) in their promoter regions. We hypothesized that transcription factors induced by RA and downstream of CREB mediate podocyte differentiation. We performed microarray gene expression studies in human podocytes treated with and without RA to identify differentially regulated genes. In comparison with known CREB target genes, we identified Krüppel-like factor 15 (KLF15), a kidney-enriched nuclear transcription factor, that has been previously shown to mediate cell differentiation. We confirmed that RA increased KLF15 expression in both murine and human podocytes. Overexpression of KLF15 stimulated expression of differentiation markers in both wild-type and HIV-1-infected podocytes. Also, KLF15 binding to the promoter regions of nephrin and podocin was increased in RA-treated podocytes. Although KLF15−/− mice at base line had minimal phenotype, lipopolysaccharide- or adriamycin-treated KLF15−/− mice had a significant increase in proteinuria and podocyte foot process effacement with a reduction in the expression of podocyte differentiation markers as compared with the wild-type treated mice. Finally, KLF15 expression was reduced in glomeruli isolated from HIV transgenic mice as well as in kidney biopsies from patients with HIV-associated nephropathy and idiopathic focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. These results indicate a critical role of KLF15 in mediating podocyte differentiation and in protecting podocytes against injury.

https://openalex.org/W1985713298,"Atherosclerosis is initiated by the retention of lipoproteins on proteoglycans in the arterial intima. However, the mechanisms leading to proteoglycan accumulation and lipoprotein retention are poorly understood. In this study, we set out to investigate the role of ADAMTS-5 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs-5) in the vasculature. ADAMTS-5 was markedly reduced in atherosclerotic aortas of apolipoprotein E-null (apoE−/−) mice. The reduction of ADAMTS-5 was accompanied by accumulation of biglycan and versican, the major lipoprotein-binding proteoglycans, in atherosclerosis. ADAMTS-5 activity induced the release of ADAMTS-specific versican (DPEAAE441) and aggrecan (374ALGS) fragments as well as biglycan and link protein from the aortic wall. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) inhibited ADAMTS-5 expression in isolated aortic smooth muscle cells and blocked the spontaneous release of ADAMTS-generated versican and aggrecan fragments from aortic explants. In aortas of ADAMTS-5-deficient mice, DPEAAE441 versican neoepitopes were not detectable. Instead, biglycan levels were increased, highlighting the role of ADAMTS-5 in the catabolism of vascular proteoglycans. Importantly, ADAMTS-5 proteolytic activity reduced the LDL binding ability of biglycan and released LDL from human aortic lesions. This study provides the first evidence implicating ADAMTS-5 in the regulation of proteoglycan turnover and lipoprotein retention in atherosclerosis.

According to the response-to-retention hypothesis (1Williams K.J. Tabas I. The response-to-retention hypothesis of early atherogenesis.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc.

These proatherogenic molecules, in particular low-density lipoprotein (LDL), are trapped by proteoglycans in atherosclerosis-prone areas and become modified, commonly by aggregation and oxidation (2Chait A. Wight T.N. Interaction of native and modified low-density lipoproteins with extracellular matrix.Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2000; 11: 457-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).

The interaction of lipoproteins with proteoglycans is ionic. Positively charged residues on apoB (and other apolipoproteins) interact with sulfated, negatively charged glycosaminoglycan (GAG) side chains of proteoglycans (3Williams K.J. Tabas I. The response-to-retention hypothesis of atherogenesis reinforced.Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1998; 9: 471-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Other, more complex interactions involve the lipid moieties of lipoproteins and the proteoglycan core proteins (4Tabas I. Williams K.J. Borén J. Subendothelial lipoprotein retention as the initiating process in atherosclerosis: update and therapeutic implications.Circulation. 2007; 116: 1832-1844Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar). Proteoglycans with chondroitin sulfate GAGs, such as biglycan and versican, play the major role in LDL retention (5Wight T.N. Merrilees M.J. Proteoglycans in atherosclerosis and restenosis: key roles for versican.Circ. Res. 2004; 94: 1158-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Both proteoglycans accumulate in atherosclerosis-prone arteries, and their GAG composition is affected by proatherogenic stimuli (6Skålén K. Gustafsson M. Rydberg E.K. Hultén L.M. Wiklund O. Innerarity T.L. Borén J. Subendothelial retention of atherogenic lipoproteins in early atherosclerosis.Nature. 2002; 417: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Biglycan is associated with apoB-containing lipoproteins at all stages of atherosclerosis (7Nakashima Y. Fujii H. Sumiyoshi S. Wight T.N. Sueishi K.

Although the role of proteoglycans in the vasculature is well characterized, little is known about mechanisms that control their remodeling and accumulation in atherosclerosis. In this study, we characterized the catabolic properties of a major proteoglycan-degrading enzyme, ADAMTS-5 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin motifs-5), on vascular proteoglycans and revealed its ability to alter proteoglycan-mediated lipoprotein retention. For the first time, we implicate reduction of ADAMTS-5 activity in proteoglycan accumulation and lipoprotein binding in atherosclerosis.

Total RNA was extracted from murine abdominal aortas (two aortas were pooled for each experimental condition) or isolated aortic SMCs (2 × 106) using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and purified using a spin column kit (Qiagen) (16Cole J.E.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 2372-2377Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). 1 μg of RNA from SMCs or 700 ng of RNA from abdominal aortas was converted to cDNA using the high capacity RNA-to-cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems). 10 ng of RNA/reaction was quantified with the TaqMan real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems), using their prevalidated primers/probe mixes, at a concentration of 900 nm for each primer and 200 nm for the probe. TaqMan Probes: biglycan, Mm00455918_m1; versican, Mm01283063_m1; and gapdh, Mm99999915_g1. Real-time PCR was performed using an ABI Prism thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). Data analysis was carried out with the SDS software (version 2.2) from the same company. All samples were measured in duplicate and compared with the expression levels of gapdh. The assay was performed as described (6Skålén K. Gustafsson M. Rydberg E.K. Hultén L.M. Wiklund O. Innerarity T.L. Borén J. Subendothelial retention of atherogenic lipoproteins in early atherosclerosis.Nature. 2002; 417: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Following the binding of human LDL on biglycan immobilized on MaxiSorp 96-well immunoplates (NUNC), the wells were covered either with plain MMP buffer or MMP buffer supplemented with 100 pm ADAMTS-5 for 5 h at 37 °C. The immunoplates were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h followed by 1:50 lipoprotein-deficient serum (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h. Finally, the wells were developed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated polyclonal antibodies against human apoB-100 using the 1-Step Turbo TMB-ELISA substrate (Thermo Scientific). Following treatment with ADAMTS-5, aortic supernatants (10 μg/ml) were used to coat immunoplates overnight at room temperature and apoB-100 was quantified as above. Levels of ADAMTS-5 were compared in aortas of young (10-week) and old (48-week) WT and apoE−/− mice. Representative aortic root sections were stained with Oil red O to visualize atherosclerotic lesions (17Mayr M. Chung Y.L. Mayr U. Yin X. Ly L. Troy H. Fredericks S. Hu Y. Griffiths J.R. Xu Q. Proteomic and metabolomic analyses of atherosclerotic vessels from apolipoprotein E-deficient mice reveal alterations in inflammation, oxidative stress, and energy metabolism.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2005; 25: 2135-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). 10-week-old apoE−/− mice had mild lesions (8.5% ± 2.4 S.D.) as compared with 48-week-old apoE−/− animals (45.75% ± 7.5 S.D.). No lesions were observed in aortic roots of WT mice (Fig. 1A). Immunoblotting revealed a reduction of the active form of ADAMTS-5 (∼75 kDa) in atherosclerotic aortas (Fig. 1, B and C), which was accompanied by accumulation of biglycan and versican (Fig. 1, B and C). Because transcript levels were unchanged (Fig. 1D), accumulation of these proteoglycans could be, at least in part, due to reduced catabolism. The pro-form of ADAMTS-1 (∼110 kDa), another versican-cleaving protease (18Sandy J.D. Westling J. Kenagy R.D. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Verscharen C. Rodriguez-Mazaneque J.C. Zimmermann D.R. Lemire J.M.

The loss of ADAMTS-5 was associated with reduction in ADAMTS-generated DPEAAE441 versican fragments in aortas of 10- and 48-week-old apoE−/− mice (Fig. 1D). The ability of ADAMTS-5 to cleave versican at the Glu441-Ala442 bond has been recently demonstrated in a study of interdigital ECM web regression (20McCulloch D.R. Nelson C.M. Dixon L.J. Silver D.L. Wylie J.D. Lindner V. Sasaki T. Cooley M.A. Argraves W.S. Apte S.S. ADAMTS metalloproteases generate active versican fragments that regulate interdigital web regression.Dev.

It is analogous to its well studied activity in articular cartilage, where the cleavage of the aggrecan Glu373-Ala374 bond results in the generation of NITEGE373-374ALGS fragments (374ARGS in human aggrecan), the hallmark of ADAMTS-5 activity (21Sawaji Y.

Interestingly, dimeric FGF-2 (∼35 kDa) accumulated in 48-week-old apoE−/− aortas (Fig. 1D). Although FGF-2 is a key regulator of ADAMTS-5 expression and activity in cartilage (21Sawaji Y. Hynes J.

Aortic SMCs were isolated from WT or apoE−/− mice (14Mayr M. Zampetaki A. Sidibe A. Mayr U. Yin X. De Souza A.I. Chung Y.L. Madhu B. Quax P.H. Hu Y. Griffiths J.R. Xu Q.

Res. 2008; 102: 1046-1056Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Both expressed (Fig. 1E) and secreted ADAMTS-5 (Fig. 1F). Stimulation with FGF-2 reduced ADAMTS-5 expression (Fig. 1, E and F) but increased levels of versican in the culture medium. Biglycan was unchanged. FGF-2 also inhibited the secretion of the pro-form of ADAMTS-1, whereas MMP-2 (a metalloprotease unrelated to ADAMTSs) was not affected (Fig. 1F), indicating that FGF-2 is not a global inhibitor of metalloprotease expression in SMCs. When aortic explants of 10-week-old WT mice were cultured ex vivo for 24 h, stimulation with FGF-2 reduced ADAMTS-5 levels in the conditioned medium and inhibited the spontaneous release of 374ALGS aggrecan and DPEAAE441 versican fragments (Fig. 1G), indicating reduction of ADAMTS catabolic activity. Although little is known about the regulation of ADAMTS-5 expression and activity in tissues, our findings are in line with recent studies reporting increased ADAMTS-5 activity and aggrecan breakdown in fgf2−/− mice (22Chia S.L. Sawaji Y. Burleigh A. McLean C. Inglis J. Saklatvala J. Vincent T. Fibroblast growth factor 2 is an intrinsic chondroprotective agent that suppresses ADAMTS-5 and delays cartilage degradation in murine osteoarthritis.Arthritis Rheum. 2009; 60: 2019-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In another study, stimulation of cartilage explants and chondrocytes with FGF-2 inhibited ADAMTS-5 mRNA expression and blocked the release of aggrecan fragments following stimulation with IL-1 (21Sawaji Y. Hynes J. Vincent T. Saklatvala J. Fibroblast growth factor 2 inhibits induction of aggrecanase activity in human articular cartilage.Arthritis Rheum. 2008; 58: 3498-3509Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the vasculature, the suppression of ADAMTS-5 by FGF-2 could be related to the ability of the growth factor to increase neointima formation following arterial injury (25Agrotis A. Kanellakis P. Kostolias G. Di Vitto G. Wei C. Hannan R. Jennings G. Bobik A.

Chem. 2004; 279: 42221-42229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). To assess the proteolytic properties of ADAMTS-5 on vascular proteoglycans, murine aortas were incubated with recombinant ADAMTS-5. ADAMTS-1 was used for comparison. ADAMTS-5 caused the release of 374ALGS aggrecan and DPEAAE441 versican fragments as well as full-length biglycan and link protein (HPLN1) (Fig. 2A). Biglycan is a known target of ADAMTS-5, in vitro (26Gendron C. Kashiwagi M. Lim N.H. Enghild J.J. Thøgersen I.B. Hughes C. Caterson B. Nagase H. Proteolytic activities of human ADAMTS-5: comparative studies with ADAMTS-4.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 18294-18306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) and in cartilage (27Zhen E.Y. Brittain I.J. Laska D.A. Mitchell P.G. Sumer E.U. Karsdal M.A. Duffin K.L. Characterization of metalloprotease cleavage products of human articular cartilage.Arthritis Rheum. 2008; 58: 2420-2431Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The release of link protein indicates that ADAMTS-5 catabolic activity could compromise the binding of proteoglycans with hyaluronan (28Chockalingam P.S. Zeng W. Morris E.A. Flannery C.R. Release of hyaluronan and hyaladherins (aggrecan G1 domain and link proteins) from articular cartilage exposed to ADAMTS-4 (aggrecanase 1) or ADAMTS-5 (aggrecanase 2).Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 2839-2848Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). When proteoglycans from ADAMTS-treated aortas were extracted using 4 m guanidine, ADAMTS-1 was also able to generate DPEAAE441 fragments (Fig. 2B), but unlike ADAMTS-5, it did not induce their release into the supernatant (Fig. 2A). Next, incubation of human aortic tissue with either ADAMTS-1 or ADAMTS-5 resulted in the release of DPEAAE441 fragments (Fig. 2C). The additional DPEAAE-immunoreactive band at ∼150 kDa most likely represents the less abundant versican V0 isoform cleaved at the DPEAAE1428 bond (18Sandy J.D. Westling J. Kenagy R.D. Iruela-Arispe M.L. Verscharen C. Rodriguez-Mazaneque J.C. Zimmermann D.R. Lemire J.M. Fischer J.W. Wight T.N. Clowes A.W. Versican V1 proteolysis in human aorta in vivo occurs at the Glu441-Ala442 bond, a site that is cleaved by recombinant ADAMTS-1 and ADAMTS-4.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 13372-13378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Instead, HPLN1 and biglycan were only released following treatment with ADAMTS-5. 374ARGS (human aggrecan neoepitope) was not detected in the aortic supernatant. The activity of the proteases was also examined using purified bovine substrates; both ADAMTS-1 and ADAMTS-5 digested biglycan (supplemental Fig. 1A), but only ADAMTS-5 generated aggrecan fragments (supplemental Fig. 1B). To further investigate the proteolytic role of the enzyme in the vasculature, aortas from mice lacking ADAMTS-5 catalytic activity (TS5 Δcat) (12Stanton H. Rogerson F.M. East C.J. Golub S.B. Lawlor K.E. Meeker C.T. Little C.B. Last K. Farmer P.J. Campbell I.K. Fourie A.M. Fosang A.J. ADAMTS5 is the major aggrecanase in mouse cartilage in vivoin vitro.Nature. 2005; 434: 648-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar) were compared with aortas of WT and apoE−/− mice (Fig. 2D). DPEAAE441 versican neoepitopes were barely detectable in TS5 Δcat aortas (Fig. 2, D and E). In contrast, biglycan was increased, reaffirming the role of ADAMTS-5 in the processing of vascular proteoglycans in vivo. Moreover, 10-week-old WT murine aortas were cultured ex vivo in the presence of a specific ADAMTS-5 inhibitor (IC50 1.1 μm) (15Gilbert A.M. Bursavich M.G. Lombardi S. Georgiadis K.E. Reifenberg E. Flannery C.R. Morris E.A. N-((8-Hydroxy-5-substituted-quinolin-7-yl)(phenyl)methyl)-2-phenyloxy/amino-acetamide inhibitors of ADAMTS-5 (aggrecanase-2).Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2008; 18: 6454-6457Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. 2). At 1.2 μm, the inhibitor completely blocked the generation of DPEAAE441 in aortic explants. Taken together, our findings are consistent with recent studies reporting that ADAMTS-5 deletion attenuates versicanolysis in the skin pericellular matrix, evidenced by the reduction of DPEAAE441 fragments (30Hattori N. Carrino D.A. Lauer M.E. Vasanji A. Wylie J.D. Nelson C.M. Apte S.S. Pericellular versican regulates the fibroblast-myofibroblast transition: a role for ADAMTS5 protease-mediated proteolysis.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 34298-34310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Given the key role of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans in lipoprotein retention, we investigated whether ADAMTS-induced proteoglycan fragmentation affects LDL binding. 96-well immunoplates coated with biglycan were used as binding substrates for purified, human LDL (6Skålén K. Gustafsson M. Rydberg E.K. Hultén L.M. Wiklund O. Innerarity T.L. Borén J. Subendothelial retention of atherogenic lipoproteins in early atherosclerosis.Nature. 2002; 417: 750-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). Digestion of biglycan with ADAMTS-5 caused loss of apoB-100 from the biglycan-coated surface (Fig. 2F). Moreover, treatment of human aortic specimens (supplemental Fig. 3A) with ADAMTS-5 resulted in the release of LDL from the vascular matrix (Fig. 2G), accompanied by DPEAAE441 fragments and biglycan as well as apoA1 and apoE (Fig. 2H), also known to interact with biglycan (29Olin K.L. Potter-Perigo S. Barrett P.H. Wight T.N. Chait A. Biglycan, a vascular proteoglycan, binds differently to HDL2 and HDL3: role of apoE.Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Coomassie Blue staining revealed a consistent protein pattern in the supernatants (supplemental Fig. 3B). Our data suggest that proteoglycan catabolism by ADAMTS-5 alters lipoprotein binding to the vascular matrix, and this could have important implications in atherosclerotic lesion formation. Next, we examined the relationship between apoB and versican neoepitopes in advanced murine plaques. Strong apoB staining was seen on the entire lesion surface. The signal for DPEAAE441 fragments was weak (Fig. 2I, left panels), confirming low ADAMTS proteolytic activity. Following incubation of the aorta with ADAMTS-5 (+TS5), the newly generated DPEAAE441 fragments colocalized with apoB (Fig. 2I, right panels), demonstrating that processing by ADAMTS-5 may affect the interaction of versican with lipoproteins. Although other metalloproteases could also induce loss of lipoproteins from the vascular extracellular space by degrading the ECM, the specific and potent activity of ADAMTS-5 on the LDL-binding, proteoglycan fraction of the matrix is intriguing. Our study does not exclude the role of other metalloproteases in the processing of proatherogenic proteoglycans. For instance, we failed to detect the mature form of ADAMTS-1 (∼80 kDa), but other, potentially active forms may be present. Nonetheless, aortas of ADAMTS-5-deficient mice showed a lack of ADAMTS-induced versicanolysis (Fig. 2, D and E). At present, we have no in vivo evidence for the role of ADAMTS-5 in atherosclerosis, but its function in vascular proteoglycan remodeling and lipoprotein retention warrants further investigation. In this study, we showed for the first time that ADAMTS-5 is reduced in a murine model of atherosclerosis and that this reduction coincides with the accumulation of biglycan and versican, the major LDL-binding species."
https://openalex.org/W1989465440,"With regard to Hedgehog signaling in mammalian development, the majority of research has focused on Gli2 and Gli3 rather than Gli1. This is because Gli1(-/-) mice do not show any gross abnormalities in adulthood, and no detailed analyses of fetal Gli1(-/-) mice are available. In this study, we investigated the physiological role of Gli1 in osteogenesis. Histological analyses revealed that bone formation was impaired in Gli1(-/-) fetuses compared with WT fetuses. Gli1(-/-) perichondrial cells expressed neither runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) nor osterix, master regulators of osteogenesis, in contrast to WT cells. In vitro analyses showed that overexpression of Gli1 up-regulated early osteogenesis-related genes in both WT and Runx2(-/-) perichondrial cells, and Gli1 activated transcription of those genes via its association with their 5'-regulatory regions, underlying the function of Gli1 in the perichondrium. Moreover, Gli1(-/-);Gli2(-/-) mice showed more severe phenotypes of impaired bone formation than either Gli1(-/-) or Gli2(-/-) mice, and osteoblast differentiation was impaired in Gli1(-/-);Gli3(-/-) perichondrial cells compared with Gli3(-/-) cells in vitro. These data suggest that Gli1 itself can induce early osteoblast differentiation, at least to some extent, in a Runx2-independent manner. It also plays a redundant role with Gli2 and is involved in the repressor function of Gli3 in osteogenesis. On the basis of these findings, we propose that upon Hedgehog input, Gli1 functions collectively with Gli2 and Gli3 in osteogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2008309928,"AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is an energy-sensing enzyme central to the regulation of metabolic homeostasis. In the heart AMPK is activated during cardiac stress-induced ATP depletion and functions to stimulate metabolic pathways that restore the AMP/ATP balance. Recently it was demonstrated that AMPK phosphorylates cardiac troponin I (cTnI) at Ser-150 in vitro. We sought to determine if the metabolic regulatory kinase AMPK phosphorylates cTnI at Ser-150 in vivo to alter cardiac contractile function directly at the level of the myofilament. Rabbit cardiac myofibrils separated by two-dimensional isoelectric focusing subjected to a Western blot with a cTnI phosphorylation-specific antibody demonstrates that cTnI is endogenously phosphorylated at Ser-150 in the heart. Treatment of myofibrils with the AMPK holoenzyme increased cTnI Ser-150 phosphorylation within the constraints of the muscle lattice. Compared with controls, cardiac fiber bundles exchanged with troponin containing cTnI pseudo-phosphorylated at Ser-150 demonstrate increased sensitivity of calcium-dependent force development, blunting of both PKA-dependent calcium desensitization, and PKA-dependent increases in length dependent activation. Thus, in addition to the defined role of AMPK as a cardiac metabolic energy gauge, these data demonstrate AMPK Ser-150 phosphorylation of cTnI directly links the regulation of cardiac metabolic demand to myofilament contractile energetics. Furthermore, the blunting effect of cTnI Ser-150 phosphorylation cross-talk can uncouple the effects of myofilament PKA-dependent phosphorylation from β-adrenergic signaling as a novel thin filament contractile regulatory signaling mechanism.

Carling D. The AMP-activated protein kinase. Fuel gauge of the mammalian cell?.Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar, 2Arad M. Seidman C.E. Seidman J.G. AMP-activated protein kinase in the heart. Role during health and disease.Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 474-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). By responding to various metabolic changes, AMPK regulates key enzymes in metabolic pathways to restore cellular energy stores. Classical AMPK activation results from the increase in cellular AMP/ATP ratio-induced AMP binding during periods of high energy demands. This ability of AMPK to “sense” decreased ATP levels and its subsequent activation to increase ATP production have led AMPK to be termed the “master switch” for maintaining cellular energy levels (1Hardie D.G. Carling D. The AMP-activated protein kinase. Fuel gauge of the mammalian cell?.Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar). In the heart, AMPK signaling to increase ATP during elevated metabolic demand is necessary to maintain cardiac contractility. Recent evidence has demonstrated AMPK is activated by other stimuli in addition to AMP binding (3Young L.H. Li J. Baron S.J. Russell R.R. AMP-activated protein kinase.

Several lines of evidence indicate that cardiac troponin I (cTnI) may be a significant substrate for AMPK. Troponin I (TnI) plays a critical role in the regulation of muscle contraction (5Perry S.V. Troponin I. Inhibitor or facilitator.Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 190: 9-32Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of cTnI at Ser-23/24 through the β-adrenergic signaling pathway represents one of the primary myofilament mechanisms to regulate cardiac contractile dynamics (for review, see Ref. 6Kobayashi T.

Serine 150 is located directly within the TnI switch peptide, a key element in the Ca2+ regulation of muscle contraction. Evidence supporting Ser-150 phosphorylation as functionally relevant has been demonstrated by Ouyang et al. (13Ouyang Y. Mamidi R. Jayasundar J.J. Chandra M. Dong W.J. Structural and kinetic effects of PAK3 phosphorylation mimic of cTnI(S151E) on the cTnC-cTnI interaction in the cardiac thin filament.J. Mol. Biol. 2010; 400: 1036-1045Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) who reported cTnI pseudo-phosphorylation altered the interaction of cTnI with troponin C (TnC) to affect thin filament Ca2+ regulation. To date the phosphorylation of cTnI Ser-150 in vivo and its functional effect on contraction are not known. To determine the role of AMPK as a common signaling molecule between cardiomyocyte cellular metabolism and contractile function, we investigated the role of AMPK to phosphorylate cTnI at Ser-150 and its effect on cardiac contraction. Consistent with previous findings, we demonstrate the AMPK holoenzyme phosphorylates cTnI at Ser-150 in vitro as well as within the muscle lattice. We further demonstrate that cTnI is endogenously phosphorylated at Ser-150 in the heart. Through the exchange of cardiac troponin (cTn) containing a pseudo-phosphorylated cTnI into cardiac-skinned fibers we demonstrate cTnI Ser-150 phosphorylation significantly increases cardiac muscle Ca2+ sensitivity. Importantly, this cTnI Ser-150 phosphorylation cross-talks through an intramolecular mechanism within cTnI to blunt the functional effects of β-adrenergic-induced cTnI Ser-23/24 PKA phosphorylation. Our findings support AMPK as a signaling molecule that links the cardiac myocyte metabolic needs to a direct enhancement of the myofilament contractile response through uncoupling the thin filament β-adrenergic response. The human cTnI Ser-150 to Asp (cTnI S150D), Ser-23/24 to Asp (S23D/S24D), and Ser-23/24/150 to Asp (S23D/S24D/S150D) pseudo phosphorylation mutant cDNA was generated by site-directed mutagenesis (QuikChange II kit, Agilent) according to the manufacturer's directions, and resultant constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. All cTnI residue numbers presented in this manuscript are presented according to the native human sequence including the first methionine. The individual recombinant human cTn subunits were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity as previously described (14Biesiadecki B.J. Kobayashi T. Walker J.S.

Res. 2007; 100: 1486-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Troponin used for fiber exchange and kinase experiments contained human cardiac TnT (TnT) with an N terminal myc tag. Our laboratory and others have previously demonstrated the presence of this myc tag on TnT does not affect myofilament function (15Tardiff J.C. Factor S.M. Tompkins B.D. Hewett T.E. Palmer B.M.

Troponin used in Ca2+ binding experiments consisted of native human TnT, cTnI, and human cardiac TnC with the T53C, S35C/S84C mutations (17Davis J.P. Norman C. Kobayashi T. Solaro R.J. Swartz D.R.

Cardiac Tn complexes were reconstituted by sequential dialysis and column-purified as previously described (14Biesiadecki B.J. Kobayashi T. Walker J.S. John Solaro R. de Tombe P.P.

Column fractions containing pure cTn were dialyzed against exchange buffer (200 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm MOPS, pH 6.5), and aliquots were stored at −80 °C until use. Myofibrils were prepared as described previously and endogenous cTn was partially exchanged for exogenous cTn as previously described (14Biesiadecki B.J. Kobayashi T. Walker J.S. John Solaro R. de Tombe P.P. The troponin C G159D mutation blunts myofilament desensitization induced by troponin I Ser-23/24 phosphorylation.Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 1486-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Purified cTn or exchanged myofibrils were treated with purified PAK, purified bovine protein kinase A catalytic subunit (Sigma), or active AMPK holoenzyme complex composed of α1/β1/γ2 or α2/β1/γ2 subunits (SignalChem). Kinase reaction conditions were 200 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, in the presence of 2.5 mm EGTA or 0.25 mm CaCl2. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 mm ATP and carried out at 37 °C for varying time points before stopping the reaction with an equal volume of 2× urea sample buffer consisting of 8 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 75 mm DTT, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 3% SDS and 0.05% bromphenol blue. Samples were stored at −80 °C until use. Proteins (purified, myofibrils, or fiber bundles) were solubilized in denaturing sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, and 10% glycerol), heated for 5 min at 80 °C, and clarified by centrifugation for 5 min. Resultant protein was separated by SDS-PAGE on cooled 8 × 10-cm (Hoefer) 12% (29:1) polyacrylamide gels by methods previously described (18Biesiadecki B.J. Tachampa K. Yuan C. Jin J.P. de Tombe P.P.

Gels were either stained for phosphoproteins or total protein or transferred to membranes for Western blot as described in the figure legends. Phosphoproteins were identified by ProQ Diamond phosphoprotein staining (Invitrogen) and imaged on a Typhoon 9410 imager (GE Healthcare) with an excitation of 532 nm and 580BP30 emission filter according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total protein was visualized by Coomassie and digitized or Sypro Ruby (Invitrogen) staining imaged on a Typhoon 9410 (GE Healthcare) with an excitation of 457 nm and a 610BP30 emission filter (18Biesiadecki B.J.

Western blot was conducted by wet transfer (Hoefer) of proteins to 0.45 μm PVDF at 10 °C for 90 min at 90 V as previously described (18Biesiadecki B.J. Tachampa K. Yuan C. Jin J.P. de Tombe P.P.

Cardiac TnI Ser-150 phosphorylation was identified with the rabbit pTnI 150 antibody, detected by a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit secondary, and developed with ECL Plus (GE Healthcare) on Hyperfilm (GE Healthcare). Subsequently, total cTnI was detected after blocking by re-probing the same membrane with the mouse cTnI antibody C5 (Fitzgerald) and detected with an alkaline phosphatase anti-mouse secondary antibody incubated in 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. This sequential development using different primary/secondary combinations and development methods is critical to avoid signal bleed from the first Western to the second. Alternately, myofibril gels probed for pTnI 150 were transferred to 0.22-μm low fluorescence PVDF (GE Healthcare) for fluorescent Dylight secondary (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) detection on a Typhoon 9410 imager (GE Healthcare). Cardiac TnI was analyzed by two-dimensional isoelectric focusing on 18-cm 7–11 IPG strips (GE Healthcare) by methods previously described (18Biesiadecki B.J. Tachampa K. Yuan C. Jin J.P. de Tombe P.P. Solaro R.J. Removal of the cardiac troponin I N-terminal extension improves cardiac function in aged mice.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 19688-19698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), except the first dimension of focusing was carried out on an Agilent 3100 OffGel fractionator (Agilent) run in the “in-gel” method. Resultant strips were separated in the second dimension on 18 × 8-cm (Hoefer) 12% (29:1) gels. The percent of cTnI Ser-150 phosphorylated was determined by comparing a Western blot of rabbit and rat heart myofibrils to a maximally phosphorylated cTnI Ser-150 human cTn standard sample determined in a time course AMPK treatment probed with the pTnI 150 antibody. Unknown myofibrils and the Ser-150 maximally phosphorylated standard were run on the same gel, and Ser-150 phosphorylation was determined by Western blot with the pTnI 150 antibody. After total cTnI detection by differential fluorescent secondary antibody and quantification using ImageQuant TL 7.0 (GE Healthcare), the percent total cTnI Ser-150 phosphorylation was determined as (sample pTnI 150 signal/sample total cTnI)/(standard pTnI 150 signal/standard total cTnI) × 100. Left ventricular papillary muscles were dissected from hearts of mice anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital as previously described (19Wolska B.M. Keller R.S. Evans C.C. Palmiter K.A. Phillips R.M.

Correlation between myofilament response to Ca2+ and altered dynamics of contraction and relaxation in transgenic cardiac cells that express β-tropomyosin.Circ. Res. 1999; 84: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). After dissection, muscles were cut in uniform strips of no greater than 150 μm in diameter and treated with 1% (v/v) Triton X-100 in relax buffer (41.89 mm potassium propionate, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm creatine phosphate, 6.22 mm ATP, 6.57 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaN3, and 100 mm BES, pH 7.0) at 4 °C for 4 h to extract membranes (skinned). The endogenous cTn from the resultant fiber bundles was then exchanged for exogenous cTn by overnight incubation at 4 °C in 13 μm recombinant cTn (14Biesiadecki B.J. Kobayashi T. Walker J.S. John Solaro R. de Tombe P.P. The troponin C G159D mutation blunts myofilament desensitization induced by troponin I Ser-23/24 phosphorylation.Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 1486-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Exogenous and endogenous TnT migrate at different mobilities when separated by SDS-PAGE; therefore, the percent of exogenous cTn exchange to total fiber cTn was determined in each fiber by Western blot for TnT with the mouse TnT monoclonal antibody CT3 (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) as previously described (14Biesiadecki B.J. Kobayashi T. Walker J.S. John Solaro R. de Tombe P.P. The troponin C G159D mutation blunts myofilament desensitization induced by troponin I Ser-23/24 phosphorylation.Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 1486-1493Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Animal care and use was performed in accordance with the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Illinois at Chicago and The Ohio State University. The measurement of steady-state isometric tension as a function of free Ca2+ was conducted as previously described (19Wolska B.M. Keller R.S. Evans C.C. Palmiter K.A. Phillips R.M. Muthuchamy M. Oehlenschlager J. Wieczorek D.F. de Tombe P.P. Solaro R.J.

Res. 1999; 84: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Fiber measurements to determine skinned fiber mechanical parameters were conducted at a sarcomere length of 2.2 μm as determined by laser diffraction, whereas fiber measurements to determine length-dependent activation were conducted at sarcomere lengths of 1.9 and 2.2 μm in the same fiber (20Konhilas J.P. Irving T.C. Wolska B.M. Jweied E.E. Martin A.F. Solaro R.J. de Tombe P.P. Troponin I in the murine myocardium. Influence on length-dependent activation and interfilament spacing.J.

Attenuation of length dependence of calcium activation in myofilaments of transgenic mouse hearts expressing slow skeletal troponin I.J. Physiol. 2000; 526: 541-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Fiber bundles were activated over a range of free Ca2+ concentrations to determine steady-state isometric tension. Only muscles that maintained greater then 85% maximal tension were included for analysis. After the mechanical experiment, each bundle was briefly dried and stored frozen for biochemical analysis. Steady-state thin filament Ca2+ binding to TnC was measured as previously described (17Davis J.P. Norman C. Kobayashi T. Solaro R.J. Swartz D.R. Tikunova S.B. Effects of thin and thick filament proteins on calcium binding and exchange with cardiac troponin C.Biophys. J. 2007; 92: 3195-3206Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Briefly, thin filaments were reconstituted with various cTnI in the presence of 2-(4′-iodoacetamidoanilo)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid (IAANS)-labeled C35S, C84S, and T53C TnC, and IAANS fluorescence was measured at various free Ca2+ concentrations as indicative of Ca2+ binding to TnC. Tension-Ca2+ relationships and steady-state Ca2+ binding were fit to a modified Hill equation to determine 50% maximal binding and Hill coefficient. PKA phosphorylation of cTn over time was fit with a single exponential to determine time to 50% maximal phosphorylation. Results of skinned fiber force measurements, length-dependent activation, and Ca2+ binding were compared by ANOVA with the Bonferroni post-hoc evaluation. Cardiac Tn phosphorylation was compared by Student's t test. A p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. As a tool to establish the relevance of cTnI Ser-150 phosphorylation, we generated a custom antibody that specifically recognizes cTnI only when phosphorylated at Ser-150 (pTnI 150; data are reported in supplemental Figs. 1 and 2). To investigate the role of the AMPK holoenzyme to phosphorylate cTnI, we first sought to determine the effect of the functional AMPK holoenzyme (composed of α1/β1/γ2 subunits) to phosphorylate cTnI Ser-150 in purified recombinant human cTn in vitro. A Western blot with the pTnI 150 antibody demonstrates the time-dependent appearance of a single 25-kDa band after AMPK treatment that was of similar mobility to controls phosphorylated at Ser-150 with PAK (Fig. 1A). Subsequent re-probing of the membrane with a total cTnI antibody imaged by varied detection methods demonstrates the 25-kDa band is cTnI. Coomassie staining of an identical gel further demonstrates similar loading and integrity of the cTn complex. Next we conducted AMPK treatment over an extended time course to characterize AMPK holoenzyme phosphorylation of cTnI Ser-150 to saturation. Results in Fig. 1B demonstrate the phosphorylation of cTnI Ser-150 reached a maximum at 6 h without additional increased phosphorylation upon further addition of the AMPK holoenzyme. Similar to the α1/β1/γ2 AMPK holoenzyme, the α2/β1/γ2 holoenzyme also induced the time-dependent Ser-150 phosphorylation of cTnI (data not shown). These findings demonstrate cTnI Ser-150 in isolated cTn is a target of the AMPK holoenzyme. To establish the significance of cTnI Ser-150 phosphorylation in the normal heart, we conducted a Western blot of rabbit cardiac tissue separated by two-dimensional isoelectric focusing. A two-dimensional fractionated Western blot of rabbit ventricular myofibrils with the pTnI 150 antibody demonstrates three cTnI species with Ser-150 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). After stripping, the membrane was re-probed with a total cTnI antibody. Differential detection of the total cTnI antibody identified four cTnI species (Fig. 2B). Alignment of the membranes demonstrates the pTnI 150 antibody solely recognized only the three most acidic spots (P1-P3) and not the most basic, unphosphorylated spot (U). Using the maximally Ser-150-phosphorylated sample from our AMPK treatment time course as a standard, we investigated the extent of cTnI Ser-150 phosphorylation in rabbit myofibril samples. By this method we determined normal rabbit myofibrils are Ser-150 phosphorylated at about 3% of total cTnI. These results demonstrate cTnI is endogenously phosphorylated at Ser-150 in the normal rabbit heart. Next we sought to determine if the AMPK holoenzyme would phosphorylate cTnI at Ser-150 in the myofilament lattice. Employing similar methods described above, we first determined Ser-150 phosphorylation accounts for about 3% of the total cTnI in myofibrils from the normal rat heart. Endogenous cTn of rat myofibrils was then partially exchanged with purified, non-phosphorylated recombinant human cTn and treated with the AMPK holoenzyme complex (consisting of α1/β1/γ2 subunits). Western blot with a total cTnI antibody demonstrates that exogenous recombinant human cTnI migrates slightly faster than the endogenous rat cTnI (Fig. 3B). Taking advantage of this migration difference, quantification of the two cTnI species demonstrates myofibril exchange resulted in 46% recombinant human cTn that was similarly loaded in both sham (Control Tn MF) and AMPK-treated cTn-exchanged myofibrils (AMPK Tn MF). Sequential differential detection of Ser-150 phosphorylation with the pTnI 150 antibody demonstrates non-exchanged rat myofibrils (Rat MF) exhibit endogenous cTnI Ser-150 phosphorylation that was decreased after the exchange protocol (Control Tn MF) (Fig. 3A). After incubation with AMPK, endogenous rat cTnI Ser-150 phosphorylation was increased by 3.4 times, whereas exogenous human cTnI Ser-150 phosphorylation was also increased (Fig. 3A). Differential fluorescent Western imaging allowed for simultaneous detection of the pTnI 150 and total cTnI antibodies. Merge of the two antibody signals demonstrates pTnI 150 (green), and total cTnI (red) identified the same band (yellow) in the AMPK Tn MF sample (Fig. 3C). Note that AMPK-phosphorylated cTnI exhibits a slightly slower migration similar to that previously demonstrated to result from PAK Ser-150 phosphorylation (22Buscemi N. Foster D.B. Neverova I. Van Eyk J.E. p21-activated kinase increases the calcium sensitivity of rat Triton-skinned cardiac muscle fiber bundles via a mechanism potentially involving novel phosphorylation of troponin I.Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 509-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The AMPK cTnI Ser-150 phosphorylation in myofibrils was further verified by Western blots probed solely with the pTnI 150 antibody detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (data not shown). These findings demonstrate cTnI Ser-150 is endogenously phosphorylated in the rat heart, and AMPK further phosphorylates Ser-150 in the native muscle lattice. To determine the effect of cTnI Ser-150 phosphorylation on the regulation of force development, we exchanged the endogenous cTn in mouse skinned cardiac fiber bundles with either recombinant wild type (Tn WT) or Tn containing Ser-150 pseudo-phosphorylated cTnI (Tn S150D). Exchange efficiency of each fiber bundle after force measurements was evaluated by Western blot for exogenous human TnT. The results demonstrate recombinant cTn exchange averaged 70 ± 5% (Fig. 4). This percent exchange was the same for all the cTn exchange groups in the study. After exchange, fiber bundles were subjected to force-Ca2+ measurements at a sarcomere length of 2.2 μm. The results in Fig. 4A demonstrate that fibers exchanged with Tn S150D exhibit a significant 0.51 μm increase in EC50 compared with that of fibers exchanged with Tn WT (EC50; Tn WT = 1.27 ± 0.03, Tn S150D = 0.76 ± 0.02; Fig. 4, A and C, and Table 1). This change in Ca2+ sensitivity occurred in the absence of altered maximal tension development or Hill coefficient (Table 1). Thus, cTnI Ser-150 pseudophosphorylation significantly increases the ability of submaximal Ca2+ to activate the thin filament, resulting in increased force development at a given submaximal Ca2+ concentration.TABLE 1Mechanical characteristics of exchanged fiber bundlesTn exchanged1.9 μm2.2 μmΔEC50nFmaxEC50HillFmaxEC50HillTn WT21.2 ± 1.01.53 ± 0.03aANOVA = p < 0.05; W, significantly di"
https://openalex.org/W2066907652,"TRPM8 is a member of the transient receptor potential ion channel superfamily, which is expressed in sensory neurons and is activated by cold and cooling compounds, such as menthol. Activation of TRPM8 by agonists takes place through shifts in its voltage activation curve, allowing channel opening at physiological membrane potentials. Here, we studied the role of the N-glycosylation occurring at the pore loop of TRPM8 on the function of the channel. Using heterologous expression of recombinant channels in HEK293 cells we found that the unglycosylated TRPM8 mutant (N934Q) displays marked functional differences compared with the wild type channel. These differences include a shift in the threshold of temperature activation and a reduced response to menthol and cold stimuli. Biophysical analysis indicated that these modifications are due to a shift in the voltage dependence of TRPM8 activation toward more positive potentials. By using tunicamycin, a drug that prevents N-glycosylation of proteins, we also evaluated the effect of the N-glycosylation on the responses of trigeminal sensory neurons expressing TRPM8. These experiments showed that the lack of N-glycosylation affects the function of native TRPM8 ion channels in a similar way to heterologously expressed ones, causing an important shift of the temperature threshold of cold-sensitive thermoreceptor neurons. Altogether, these results indicate that post-translational modification of TRPM8 is an important mechanism modulating cold thermoreceptor function, explaining the marked differences in temperature sensitivity observed between recombinant and native TRPM8 ion channels."

Here we show that influenza virus belongs to the targets of this potent antiviral factor. Ectopic expression of tetherin strongly inhibited fully replicative influenza virus. In addition, depleting endogenous tetherin increased viral production of influenza virions, both in cells constitutively expressing tetherin and upon its induction by IFN. We further demonstrate, by biochemical and morphological means, that tetherin exerts its antiviral action by tethering newly budded viral particles, a mechanism similar to the one that operates against HIV-1. In addition, we determined that the magnitude of tetherin antiviral activity is comparable with or higher than the one of several previously identified anti-influenza cellular factors, such as MxA, ADAR1, ISG15, and viperin. Finally, we demonstrate that influenza virus reduces the impact of tetherin-mediated restriction on its replication by several mechanisms. First, the influenza virus NS1 protein impedes IFN-mediated tetherin induction. Second, influenza infection leads to a decrease of tetherin steady state levels, and the neuraminidase surface protein partly counteracts its activity.

https://openalex.org/W1981986780,"Nanog and FAK were shown to be overexpressed in cancer cells. In this report, the Nanog overexpression increased FAK expression in 293, SW480, and SW620 cancer cells. Nanog binds the FAK promoter and up-regulates its activity, whereas Nanog siRNA decreases FAK promoter activity and FAK mRNA. The FAK promoter contains four Nanog-binding sites. The site-directed mutagenesis of these sites significantly decreased up-regulation of FAK promoter activity by Nanog. EMSA showed the specific binding of Nanog to each of the four sites, and binding was confirmed by ChIP assay. Nanog directly binds the FAK protein by pulldown and immunoprecipitation assays, and proteins co-localize by confocal microscopy. Nanog binds the N-terminal domain of FAK. In addition, FAK directly phosphorylates Nanog in a dose-dependent manner by in vitro kinase assay and in cancer cells in vivo. The site-directed mutagenesis of Nanog tyrosines, Y35F and Y174F, blocked phosphorylation and binding by FAK. Moreover, overexpression of wild type Nanog increased filopodia/lamellipodia formation, whereas mutant Y35F and Y174F Nanog did not. The wild type Nanog increased cell invasion that was inhibited by the FAK inhibitor and increased by FAK more significantly than with the mutants Y35F and Y174F Nanog. Down-regulation of Nanog with siRNA decreased cell growth reversed by FAK overexpression. Thus, these data demonstrate the regulation of the FAK promoter by Nanog, the direct binding of the proteins, the phosphorylation of Nanog by FAK, and the effect of FAK and Nanog cross-regulation on cancer cell morphology, invasion, and growth that plays a significant role in carcinogenesis."

However, it is very important to understand the mechanism responsible for this activation and the relation between them. Here, we report the mechanism of EGFR expression by transcriptionally active β-catenin in GSK3β-inactivated prostate cancer cells that eventually leads to its enhanced proliferation and survival. Expressions of β-catenin and EGFR are elevated in various cancers specifically in prostate cancer cells, DU145. When GSK3β is inactivated in these cells, β-catenin gets stabilized, phosphorylated at Ser-552 by protein kinase A, accumulates in the nucleus, and regulates the expression of its target genes that include EGFR. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and promoter analysis revealed that the EGFR promoter gets occupied by transcriptionally active β-catenin when elevated in GSK3β-inactivated cells. This phenomenon not only leads to increased expression of EGFR but also initiates the activation of its downstream molecules such as ERK1/2 and Stat3, ultimately resulting in up-regulation of multiple genes involved in cell proliferation and survival.

This phenomenon not only leads to increased expression of EGFR but also initiates the activation of its downstream molecules such as ERK1/2 and Stat3, ultimately resulting in up-regulation of multiple genes involved in cell proliferation and survival. In canonical Wnt signaling, β-catenin is the key effector molecule, which has been implicated in a dual role in the cellular context. First identified as a major structural component of the cell-cell adherence junctions, it links members of the cadherin family of transmembrane adhesion proteins to the actin cytoskeleton (1.Ozawa M. Baribault H. Kemler R.

This facilitates its translocation into the nucleus where it acts as a transcriptional activator of T-cell factor (TCF)/lymphoid enhancer factor-mediated gene expression that controls an array of target genes, like c-jun, fra-1, c-myc, cyclin D1, etc., as well as genes involved in developmental stages and adult tissue homeostasis (2.Huber A.H.

Activating mutations in β-catenin, as well as inactivating mutations of its regulators such as APC, have been discovered in multiple human cancers (5.Voeller H.J. Truica C.I.

Similarly, deregulation of EGF receptor (EGFR) is often associated with carcinogenesis, which can be caused by its overexpression, gene amplification, mutations, or deletions (15.Gullick W.J. Prevalence of aberrant expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor in human cancers.Br. Med. Bull. 1991; 47: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar). Increased expression of EGFR family members EGFR (Erb-B1) and Her2 (Erb-B2) have been found in majority of human cancers that include PCa, and this is associated with a more aggressive clinical outcome (16.Di Lorenzo G. Tortora G. D'Armiento F.P. De Rosa G. Staibano S. Autorino R. D'Armiento M. De Laurentiis M. De Placido S. Catalano G. Bianco A.R. Ciardiello F.

Increased expressions of EGFR and its ligands (EGF and TGF-α) have been described in prostate tumors (19.Djakiew D. Dysregulated expression of growth factors and their receptors in the development of prostate cancer.Prostate. 2000; 42: 150-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and autocrine activation of EGFR signaling regulates the growth of androgen-independent PCa cell line, DU145 (20.Connolly J.M. Rose D.P. Autocrine regulation of DU145 human prostate cancer cell growth by epidermal growth factor-related polypeptides.Prostate. 1991; 19: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that EGFR expression is elevated in androgen-independent prostate tumors (21.Shah R.B. Ghosh D. Elder J.T. Epidermal growth factor receptor (ErbB1) expression in prostate cancer progression: Correlation with androgen independence.Prostate. 2006; 66: 1437-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Although there is an expansive evidence of literature deciphering the central role of β-catenin and EGFR in the architecture of intracellular signaling networks, little is known about their cross-talk, which may be involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival for tumorigenesis. In the present study, we investigate the role of β-catenin during GSK3β suppression and the mechanism of cross-talk with EGFR pathway in inducing cell proliferation and survival in PCa. The current data support an important role of β-catenin in enhanced survival and proliferation of PCa cells via up-regulation of EGFR gene expression that leads to activation of multiple downstream pathways. The human cell lines HEK293 (embryonic kidney), MCF7 and MDA-MB-231 (breast cancer), DU145 and PC3 (prostate cancer), and HCT116 (colon cancer) used in this study were obtained from ATCC. Cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 2000 units/liter penicillin and 2 mg/liter streptomycin (Invitrogen). All cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humid incubator with 5% CO2. Transfections of different DNA constructs were performed using either Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions or calcium phosphate protocol as described previously (22.Ghosh M.K. Sharma P. Harbor P.C. Rahaman S.O. Haque S.J. PI3K-AKT pathway negatively controls EGFR-dependent DNA-binding activity of Stat3 in glioblastoma multiforme cells.Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7290-7300Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The final concentrations of the following inhibitors used in this study were LiCl (20 mm), PD153035 (10 μm), LY294002 (20 μm), U0126 (15 μm), and H89 (10 μm) (Calbiochem) unless otherwise mentioned, and incubation times are shown in the figure legends. Control pGZ21dx vector and full-length β-catenin in pBI expression vector (pBI-β-catenin) were kind gifts from Dr. K. M. Yamada and Dr. B. Alman, respectively. Full-length human EGFR promoter was amplified from genomic DNA using flanking primers containing KpnI sites and inserted into pGL3-basic plasmid to generate pGL3-EGFR. We have analyzed the EGFR promoter to find the putative TCF4 site using TRANSFAC software, and the point mutant was generated by changing the sequence −797GCTTCAAAGT−787 to −797GCTTCACCGT−787 at the TCF4 site in the EGFR promoter using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). SuperTopFlash-TCF4 luciferase reporter (under the control of eight TCF4 consensus sites) was procured from Addgene. All constructs were verified by sequencing (sequences of all the primers used for cloning and subcloning are given in supplemental Table S1). To examine the effects of LiCl on EGFR promoter activity, HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with firefly luciferase constructs (1 μg) of pGL3-EGFR or pGL3-EGFR-Mut along with Renilla luciferase vector (pRL-TK) using calcium phosphate protocol. After 36 h, cells were kept in serum-free medium in the presence or absence of LiCl for another 6 h before being harvested for determination of luciferase activity, which was measured in a VICTOR X multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The efficiency of transfection was normalized with the Renilla luciferase expression. Luciferase activity of cell lysates was determined luminometrically using the Dual-Luciferase assay system (Promega) as specified by the manufacturer. Quantification was based on three independent experiments. For immunoblotting, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed on ice using Tris lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40 (Nonidet P-40), 10% glycerol + protease inhibitor mixture Set V, Calbiochem). Cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts were prepared using buffers of composition 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2,10 mm KCl, 10 mm HEPES for cytoplasmic extracts, and 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 0.2 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol for nuclear extracts, respectively. Thirty or fifty microgram protein equivalent lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblotting. For immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were lysed on ice using immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 250 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1.0 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT, 10 mm PMSF, and protease inhibitor mixture Set V). After preclearing with protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare), 1 mg of total protein was subjected to immunoprecipitation as described previously (22.Ghosh M.K. Sharma P. Harbor P.C. Rahaman S.O. Haque S.J. PI3K-AKT pathway negatively controls EGFR-dependent DNA-binding activity of Stat3 in glioblastoma multiforme cells.Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7290-7300Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The following antibodies were used: EGFR, β-catenin, Mcl-1, PARP, CDC6, cyclin A, GAPDH, β-actin, α-tubulin, lamin B (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Stat3, phospho-Stat3-Tyr705, phospho-β-catenin-Ser552, GSK3β, phospho-GSK3β-Ser9, cyclin D1, ERK1/2, phospho-ERK1/2-Thr202/Tyr204, AKT, phospho-AKT-Ser473, phospho-PKA (phospho-PKAα/β-Thr197), Bcl-xL, proliferating cell nuclear antigen, CDC25A, and cyclin B (Cell Signaling Technology). Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. For each sample, 2 μg of RNA was converted to cDNA using the high capacity reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems). and 100 ng of cDNA was subsequently used for qPCR analysis using Power SYBR Green Master Mix on 7500 Fast real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). In all experiments, 18 S rRNA served as the internal control (normalization), and calibrator controls were chosen appropriately. Sequences of all the primers used in qPCR are given in supplemental Table S1. DU145 cells were cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 12 min at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with glycine at a final concentration of 0.125 m and successively washed three times with PBS. The cells were then resuspended in ChIP lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, protease inhibitor mixture Set V) and sonicated to an average size of 200–1000 bp using a Misonix Ultrasonic XL-2000 liquid processor following an established protocol (23.Ghosh M.K. Harter M.L. A viral mechanism for remodeling chromatin structure in G0 cells.Mol. Cell. 2003; 12: 255-260Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, the precleared sonicated chromatin (25 μg) was incubated for 12 h at 4 °C with either 3 μg of anti-β-catenin polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or normal rabbit IgG followed by pulldown with protein A-Sepharose beads, which were preblocked with 3% BSA. The beads were successively washed with low salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.15 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) and then with high salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5 m NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), LiCl buffer (0.25 m LiCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1), and finally Tris-EDTA buffer (1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) twice for 5 min each at 4 °C. The precipitated chromatin was eluted by incubation of the beads with elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3) at room temperature for 20 min, de-cross-linked by incubation at 65 °C for 4 h in the presence of 200 mm NaCl, extracted with phenol-chloroform, and precipitated using standard ammonium acetate protocol. ChIP experiments were performed by normal PCR using suitable primers (see supplemental Table S1), Reactions were processed for one cycle at 94 °C for 3 min, and then 40 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 30 s, and at 72 °C for 30 s using Qiagen's Top Taq master mix. DU145 cells were fixed and permeabilized with 3.7% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% Triton X-100, respectively. Cells were blocked with 3% BSA (in PBS) before incubation with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C followed by secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature under dark conditions (24.Sha J. Ghosh M.K. Zhang K. Harter M.L. E1A interacts with two opposing transcriptional pathways to induce quiescent cells into S phase.J. Virol. 2010; 84: 4050-4059Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy images were taken with Nikon A1 confocal microscope using NIS-Elements software. The antibodies were used against the following proteins: phospho-β-catenin-Ser552, phospho-Stat3-Tyr705 (Cell Signaling Technology), TCF4 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology); AF488 or AF594 (Molecular Probes). Mounting medium containing DAPI was purchased from Vector Laboratories. ImageJ software was used to merge the images. Human β-catenin shRNA (pLKO.1 puro shRNA β-catenin) was purchased from Addgene (construct no. 18803). Control shRNA (non-targeting to any known genomic loci) was constructed according to the standard protocol (25.Sarbassov D.D. Sabatini D.M. Redox regulation of the nutrient-sensitive raptor-mTOR pathway and complex.J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 39505-39509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Both sense and antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized by IDT, annealed, and inserted into pLKO.1 expression vector (Addgene) between AgeI and EcoRI sites. All constructs were verified by sequencing. HiPerfect reagent (Qiagen) was used for transfection of 3–4 μg of shRNA constructs. Cells were trypsinized, pelleted, washed, and resuspended in PBS followed by fixation with ice-cold 70% ethanol and kept for 45 min on ice. After washing twice with PBS, cells were resuspended in propidium iodide/RNase staining buffer (BD Biosciences) and incubated in the dark for 15 min at ambient temperature. Cell cycle distribution was examined by flow cytometry using a FACS Array flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) and analyzed using BD FACSDiva software (version 6.1.2). Tumor sections were processed following standard methods. Histological features were examined using routine H&E staining. For immunohistochemistry, antigen retrieval was done using standard citrate buffer protocol. The following antibodies were used: phospho-GSK3β-Ser9, β-catenin, EGFR, phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-Stat3-Tyr705, and Ki67 (Cell Signaling Technology, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and Biogenex). EGFR and Wnt/β-catenin pathways are activated in most of the human cancers. To understand their involvement in cancer initiation and progression, it was important to investigate the expression pattern of EGFR and β-catenin in various established human cancer cell lines. First, we tested the expression of these two key molecules along with Stat3, an important oncoprotein, in several cell lines that include human embryonic kidney (HEK293), prostate cancer (DU145, PC3), colon cancer (HCT116), and breast cancer (MCF7, MDA-MB231) by immunoblotting. It was found that EGFR and β-catenin as well as Stat3 were highly up-regulated in metastatic prostate cancer cell line, DU145 as compared with the others (Fig. 1A). Up-regulation of β-catenin in HCT116 may be due to APC mutation (4.Morin P.J. Sparks A.B. Korinek V. Barker N. Clevers H. Vogelstein B. Kinzler K.W. Activation of β-catenin-Tcf signaling in colon cancer by mutations in β-catenin or APC.Science. 1997; 275: 1787-1790Crossref PubMed Scopus (3495) Google Scholar). Several reports suggest that both EGFR and Wnt/β-catenin pathways are important for tumor development and are up-regulated highly in DU145 cells (6.Gerstein A.V. Almeida T.A. Zhao G. Chess E. Shih I.e.M. Buhler K. Pienta K. Rubin M.A. Vessella R. Papadopoulos N. APC/CTNNB1 (β-catenin) pathway alterations in human prostate cancers.Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2002; 34: 9-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar, 26.Festuccia C. Muzi P. Millimaggi D.

Cancer. 2005; 12: 983-998Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). It is also known that multiple growth signals can induce inactivation of GSK3β by its phosphorylation at Ser9 (27.O'Brien W.T. Klein P.S. Validating GSK3 as an in vivo target of lithium action.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2009; 37: 1133-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 28.Mishra R. Glycogen synthase kinase 3β: Can it be a target for oral cancer.Mol. cancer. 2010; 9: 144Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Thus, it was interesting to find the status of β-catenin in prostate cancer patient samples. Our IHC analysis showed a distinct nuclear staining of β-catenin and increased phosphorylation of GSK3β at Ser9 in PCa. The same tissue samples were then investigated for EGFR, which depicted its elevated expression in PCa compared with PHp (Fig. 1B). Statistically significant up-regulation of β-catenin and EGFR in 2385 prostate cancer patient samples has been reported independently (29.Jaggi M. Johansson S.L. Baker J.J. Smith L.M. Galich A. Balaji K. Aberrant expression of E-cadherin and β-catenin in human prostate cancer.Urol. Oncol. 2005; 23: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 30.Whitaker H.C. Girling J. Warren A.Y.

Kirstein P. Iwers L. Daniel B. Steuber T. Walz J. Chun F.H. Haese A. Kollermann J. Graefen M. Huland H. Sauter G. Simon R. Erbersdobler A. Clinical significance of epidermal growth factor receptor protein overexpression and gene copy number gains in prostate cancer.Clin. Cancer Res. 2007; 13: 6579-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, it can be hypothesized that there is a positive correlation between nuclear β-catenin and EGFR. Next, the effect of GSK3β inactivation was tested on these molecules. DU145 and PC3 cells were serum-starved (SS) for 24 h before treatment with LiCl for 6 h to inactivate GSK3β. The result suggested that not only β-catenin but also EGFR expression was increased due to the inactivation of GSK3β by phosphorylation at Ser9 in DU145 cells and this response was highly correlated with IHC data of patient samples (Fig. 1C). As EGFR was overexpressed upon LiCl treatment, we next focused on the involvement of EGFR signaling in the survival of DU145 cells. For this, SS-DU145 cells were treated with PD153035 for the indicated time periods. PARP cleavage was detected as early as 24 h (Fig. 1D). The result indicates that EGFR signaling plays a central role in the survival of these cells because EGFR inhibitor-treated cells undergo apoptosis. Altogether, the findings indicate that EGFR is overexpressed along with β-catenin in prostate tumor samples as well as the PCa cell line DU145, and this signaling is important for the survival of these cells. To investigate the possible mechanism of EGFR expression upon GSK3β inactivation, we focused on the transcriptional activation and nuclear accumulation of β-catenin. β-Catenin can be phosphorylated on residues Ser552 and Ser675 by protein kinase B and PKA (10.Taurin S. Sandbo N. Qin Y. Browning D. Dulin N.O. Phosphorylation of β-catenin by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9971-9976Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 11.Verheyen E.M. Gottardi C.J. Regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by protein kinases.Dev. Dyn. 2010; 239: 34-44PubMed Google Scholar). We checked whether any of these phosphorylations was present in LiCl-treated cells and the kinase involved in this context. We treated the SS-DU145 cells with specific inhibitors U0126, LY294002, H89, and PD153035 targeting MEK, PI3K (for protein kinase B/AKT), PKA, and EGFR, respectively. We observed that LiCl treatment resulted in inactivation of GSK3β (phospho-GSK3β-Ser9) leading to a dose-dependent phosphorylation of β-catenin at Ser552 (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, PKA but not protein kinase B seems to play the major role in this phosphorylation event. Next, we examined the distribution of phospho-β-catenin-Ser552 in untreated and treated SS-DU145 cells. Results showed an increased level of β-catenin and its phosphorylated form (phospho-β-catenin-Ser552) in the nucleus when compared with the untreated cells and that was reduced by PKA inhibition (Fig. 2B). To further confirm this important finding, we visualized the localization pattern of phospho-β-catenin-Ser552 after treating the cells with LiCl in the presence or absence of H89 (Fig. 2C). LiCl-treated cells showed higher nuclear accumulation of phospho-β-catenin-Ser552, which was abrogated in the presence of H89 thus corroborating our findings from immunoblot. To explore the possibility for the involvement of phospho-β-catenin-Ser552, which transactivates TCF4-dependent gene expression, a confocal immunofluorescence study was done to demonstrate their colocalization in the nucleus, and as expected, it was found that they do colocalize in LiCl-treated cells (Fig. 2D). These results clearly indicate that β-catenin not only gets stabilized but also accumulates in the nucleus and co-localizes with TCF4 in GSK3β-inactivated cells. PDK1 phosphorylates PKA at Thr197 residue for its full activation (32.Moore M.J. Kanter J.R. Jones K.C. Taylor S.S. Phosphorylation of the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A. Autophosphorylation versus phosphorylation by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47878-47884Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Because we have found increased Ser552 phosphorylation of β-catenin upon LiCl treatment is due to PKA, we have tested whether any upstream molecule regulates the level of activated PKA in DU145 cells. We examine this possibility in these cells under different conditions. The level of phospho-β-catenin-Ser552 was increased in LiCl-treated cells when compared with serum-starved control without any significant change of activated PKA (phospho-PKAα/β-Thr197) level (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, we examined this phosphorylation of β-catenin in the presence of either H89 or PD153035 to see the possible involvement of EGFR-PKA pathway (Fig. 3B). Our result indicates that PKA but not EGFR is involved in this regulation. We speculated that for this phosphorylation, β-catenin should physically interact with phospho-PKAα/β-Thr197. To confirm their association, a coimmunoprecipitation assay was performed, and their interaction was indeed confirmed (Fig. 3C). Next, to examine the activity of nuclear phospho-β-catenin-Ser552, we performed a transcriptional assay using TOP-Flash/FOP-Flash system for β-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF) dependent transcription. Results showed that TCF-dependent transcription is increased upon either β-catenin overexpression or by LiCl treatment, which was reduced when treated with the PKA inhibitor H89 (Fig. 3D). To further support the data, quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed with β-catenin target genes c-myc and axin-2, which resulted in increased expression of ∼3-fold and ∼28-fold, respectively (Fig. 3E). Henceforth, it can be stated that upon LiCl treatment β-catenin associates with PKA for its phosphorylation, which is stabilized and accumulated in the nucleus and is transcriptionally active in these cells. To evaluate whether nuclear accumulation of phospho-β-catenin-Ser552 causes increased EGFR expression, SS-DU145 cells were treated with LiCl for the indicated time periods, and EGFR status was examined at both protein and mRNA levels. Results indicate that both protein and mRNA levels of EGFR were up-regulated with increased accumulation of phospho-β-catenin-Ser552 (Fig. 4, A and B).

Six distinct but paralogous proteasome ATPase proteins, Rpt1 to -6, form a heterohexameric ring that acts on substrates. An axially positioned loop (Ar-Φ loop) moves in concert with ATP hydrolysis, engages substrate, and propels it into a proteolytic chamber. The aromatic (Ar) residue of the Ar-Φ loop in all six Rpts of S. cerevisiae is tyrosine; this amino acid is thought to have important functional contacts with substrate. Six yeast strains were constructed and characterized in which Tyr was individually mutated to Ala. The mutant cells were viable and had distinct phenotypes. rpt3, rpt4, and rpt5 Tyr/Ala mutants, which cluster on one side of the ATPase hexamer, were substantially impaired in their capacity to degrade substrates. In contrast, rpt1, rpt2, and rpt6 mutants equaled or exceeded wild type in degradation activity. However, rpt1 and rpt6 mutants had defects that limited cell growth or viability under conditions that stressed the ubiquitin proteasome system. In contrast, the rpt3 mutant grew faster than wild type and to a smaller size, a defect that has previously been associated with misregulation of G1 cyclins. This rpt3 phenotype probably results from altered degradation of cell cycle regulatory proteins.

The present observations assign specific functions to individual Rpt proteins and provide insights into the diverse roles of the axial loops of individual proteasome ATPases. Proteasomes are multicomponent complexes that carry out regulated proteolysis in eukaryotic cells. They help to establish steady state levels of proteins, are key to clearing regulatory proteins whose function is no longer required, and destroy misfolded or damaged proteins that can cause cell pathology. The full complex, of ∼2.4 MDa, contains two kinds of subcomplexes (1.Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. The regulatory particle of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteasome.Mol. Cell Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein degradation takes place within the catalytic complex, also termed 20S. This consists of a stack of four seven-member rings, of composition α1–7:β1–7:β1–7:α1–7, in which each of the seven individual α and β proteins is distinct but homologous (2.Groll M. Ditzel L. Löwe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Structure of 20S proteasome from yeast at 2.4 Å resolution.Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1939) Google Scholar). Together, these form a hollow barrel-shaped structure. Protein hydrolysis takes place at catalytic sites positioned between the pair of β rings. Because these catalytic sites are sequestered from the general cellular environment, substrate proteins must gain access to the interior for degradation to occur. Entry into the barrel lies through a pore centered at the axis of the α1–7 ring that caps each end of the barrel. The diameter of the pore is sufficient to accommodate an extended polypeptide but not a native folded protein. Degradation of such proteins therefore requires that they arrive at the proteasome and be grasped, unfolded, and threaded through the α ring pore. These functions are performed by the regulatory complex, also termed 19S. It, in turn, is composed of two subcomplexes (3.Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Coux O. Wefes I. Pfeifer G. Cjeka Z. Baumeister W. Fried V.A. Finley D.

Within the base are six distinct but homologous ATPases, whose action will be the focus of this paper. These ATPases, in yeast designated Rpt1p to -6p, form a ringlike heterohexamer (4.Tomko Jr., R.J. Funakoshi M. Schneider K. Wang J. Hochstrasser M.

Together, these juxtaposed rings form a translocation channel. Fueled by ATP hydrolysis, the Rpt ring moves and unfolds substrate proteins and transfers them into the degradation chamber. These mechanisms have been studied in the compartmental proteases of bacteria, which are structurally much simpler than proteasomes (e.g. ClpXP, ClpAP, HslUV, and Lon) (7.Sauer R.T. Baker T.A. AAA+ proteases. ATP-fueled machines of protein destruction.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011; 80: 587-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). These findings are likely to be informative in understanding how proteasomes work because there is a general similarity of architecture between the bacterial and eukaryotic complexes. For example, the ClpXP protease contains a proteolytic barrel formed by two heptameric rings of ClpP, and the translocase is a homohexamer of ClpX ATPase subunits, which mounts co-axially on the ClpP14 complex. The mechanisms by which the proteasome unfolds and translocates substrate through its ATPase ring are still not well understood. Translocation and unfolding are thought to be coupled. Pulling by the ATPase ring on an accessible and unstructured portion of the substrate forces its folded domains to unravel (8.Prakash S. Tian L. Ratliff K.S. Lehotzky R.E. Matouschek A.

Proteasome substrate degradation requires association plus extended peptide.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 123-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Pulling is carried out by a mobile loop in direct contact with substrate, called the Ar-Φ (aromatic-aliphatic) loop (11.Zhang F. Hu M. Tian G. Zhang P. Finley D. Jeffrey P.D. Shi Y.

Its movements, coupled to the hydrolysis cycle of the ATPase of which it is a part, delivers a vectorial pulling force to substrate. In ClpAP, these loops contact substrate, and its tyrosine residue, the conserved Ar of the Ar-Φ loop, is essential for translocation and unfolding (13.Hinnerwisch J. Fenton W.A. Furtak K.J. Farr G.W.

Loops in the central channel of ClpA chaperone mediate protein binding, unfolding, and translocation.Cell. 2005; 121: 1029-1041Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In ClpXP, the conserved tyrosine residue was also shown to be responsible for mechanical work, gripping substrates during unfolding and translocation through a mechanism linked to ATP hydrolysis (14.Martin A. Baker T.A. Sauer R.T. Pore loops of the AAA+ ClpX machine grip substrates to drive translocation and unfolding.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2008; 15: 1147-1151Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). In the proteasome, the Ar-Φ loops of the six ATPases contain the sequence (K/M)Y(V/L/I)G, where the aromatic-aliphatic pair (Ar-Φ) are Tyr-Val/Leu/Ile. Do the invariant tyrosines of these proteasome loops perform the work of unfolding? Is the work done by the six Rpt loop tyrosines identically allocated among them or distinguishably different? In this paper, we mutated tyrosine to alanine in each Rpt Ar-Φ loop and studied the effect of the mutation on cell proliferation, on the proteasome itself, and on its ability to degrade proteins. The Rpt proteins were found to have distinguishable and specific functions. All plasmid constructions utilized standard molecular biology techniques (15.Sambrook J. Russell D.W. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001Google Scholar). The identities of DNA fragments generated by PCR were verified by sequencing. The details of cloning procedures or the sequences of the primers used for PCR constructions are available upon request. Generally, the gene coding rpt mutants was inserted into a pRS306 plasmid. Standard protocols were used for maintenance and manipulation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains (16.Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego2002Google Scholar). Yeast strain YAH96 (MATα his3-Δ200 leu2-3,112lys2–801 trp1-1 ura3-52 rpn11::RPN11-3xFLAG-HIS) was used as the genetic background for construction of rpt mutants by replacement of the wild type copy by the pop-in/pop-out technique (Table 1). Each mutant gene included a restriction site modification that allowed recognition of the mutated form of the rpt gene after colony PCR.TABLE 1Genotype of rpt mutant strainsStrainGenotypeYAH96MATα his3-Δ200 leu2-3,112lys2-801 trp1-1 ura3-52 rpn11::RPN11-3xFLAG-HISJE03MATα his3-Δ200 leu2-3,112lys2-801 trp1-1 ura3-52 rpn11::RPN11-3xFLAG-HIS Rpt1::rpt1 (Y283A)MHY292MATα his3-Δ200 leu2-3,112lys2-801 trp1-1 ura3-52 rpn11::RPN11-3xFLAG-HIS Rpt2::rpt2 (Y256A)MHY293MATα his3-Δ200 leu2-3,112lys2-801 trp1-1 ura3-52 rpn11::RPN11-3xFLAG-HIS Rpt3::rpt3 (Y246A)MHY294MATα his3-Δ200 leu2-3,112lys2-801 trp1-1 ura3-52 rpn11::RPN11-3xFLAG-HIS Rpt4::rpt4 (Y255A)MHY295MATα his3-Δ200 leu2-3,112lys2-801 trp1-1 ura3-52 rpn11::RPN11–3xFLAG-HIS Rpt5::rpt5 (Y255A)MHY296MATα his3-Δ200 leu2-3,112lys2-801 trp1-1 ura3-52 rpn11::RPN11-3xFLAG-HIS Rpt6::rpt6 (Y222A) Open table in a new tab Cells were grown to an A600 of 0.5. 10-ml cultures were harvested and resuspended in 500 μl of H2O, and 10-fold dilution series were applied to plates as described below. Cell growth in liquid YPD was also followed by a spectrophotometer at A600. Aliquots were taken to measure dry weight (17.Pringle J.R. Mor J.R. Methods for monitoring the growth of yeast cultures and for dealing with the clumping problem.Methods Cell Biol. 1975; 11: 131-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Cell size was analyzed with a Coulter Counter Z1 DIT (Beckman). For that purpose, cells were fixed by the addition of 3.7% formaldehyde and briefly sonicated to disperse clumps, and the size distribution was determined by counting the number of cells that scored within size windows between 2 and 10 μm in diameter in 0.5-μm steps. FLAG-ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) 3The abbreviation used is:ODCornithine decarboxylase. protein was expressed from p414-ADH-FLAG-ODC plasmid in wild type or rpt mutant strains. Cells were grown to an A600 of 0.7, and FLAG-ODC abundance was measured by loading 40 μg of yeast extract on a 12% denaturing gel and revealed by Western blot with anti FLAG-HRP antibodies (1:10,000; Sigma). ornithine decarboxylase. Substrates containing an Rpn10 domain were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 Rosetta strains (Novagen) as N-terminal hexahistidine-tagged proteins. 35S-Radiolabeled substrates were prepared and purified as described (9.Henderson A. Erales J. Hoyt M.A. Coffino P. Dependence of proteasome processing rate on substrate unfolding.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 17495-17502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). 26S proteasomes were purified from wild type (YAH96) or mutated strains (see Table 1) in which a 3xFLAG tag has been appended to the C terminus of the Rpn11 subunit of the proteasome. Cells were grown to an A600 of 3–4 in 1.5 liters of YPD, harvested, and washed once with 50 ml of ice-cold water. The cell pellet was then resuspended in an equal volume of proteasome buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 25 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 10% glycerol) supplemented with 2× Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and lysed by five passes through a Microfluidics microfluidizer at a pressure of 100 p.s.i. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 20,000 × g at 4 °C for 40 min. 26S proteasomes were affinity-purified by incubation with 1.2 ml of M2 anti-FLAG affinity gel (Sigma) for 45 min at 4 °C. Bound proteasome complexes were washed with 200 column volumes of proteasome buffer and eluted from the resin for 30 min in an equal volume of proteasome buffer supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml 3xFLAG peptide (Sigma). The eluates were concentrated on 100 kDa molecular mass cut-off Centricon concentrators. Proteasome composition was determined by denaturing gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie staining. Complex assembly was assessed by native gel electrophoresis (18.Elsasser S. Schmidt M. Finley D. Characterization of the proteasome using native gel electrophoresis.Methods Enzymol. 2005; 398: 353-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Proteasome molarity was calculated using a molecular mass of 2,400 kDa. Degradation reactions containing 1 μm radiolabeled protein substrates were carried out at 30 °C by 50 nm 26S proteasome in a buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, and 10% glycerol) containing 2 mm DTT, 5 mm ATP, and an ATP-regenerating system (7.5 mm phospho(enol)pyruvic acid, 1 mm NADH, and 0.5 unit of pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase mix (Sigma)). Time-dependent degradation was assessed by periodically removing 10-μl volumes from the reaction and precipitation in 140 μl of 20% TCA for 30 min on ice. After a 30-min centrifugation at 18,000 × g, the supernatant, containing the peptide products of proteolysis, was added to a scintillation vial for quantification of radioactivity. For each experiment, the total radioactivity present in substrate was determined by adding an aliquot of the degradation assay mixture to TCA, transferring the solution to a scintillation vial, and counting. Kinetic parameters were determined using SigmaPlot software. Proteasome ATPase activity was measured in a coupled assay in 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mm KCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 18 milliunits/ml lactate dehydrogenase/pyruvate kinase (Sigma), 7.5 mm phospho(enol)pyruvic acid, 1 mm NADH, 2 mm DTT, and 5 mm ATP. Proteasome concentration was 50 nm. ATPase activity was followed by loss of NADH absorbance at 340 nm. ATP consumption was calibrated using an NADH standard curve, performed with each assay. Reactions were carried out in 96-well plates in a Molecular Devices Spectra Max spectrophotometer. Strains with each of the six intended Tyr/Ala mutations were constructed and proved to be viable. These were constructed by integrating a copy of the mutant rpt gene at the homologous wild type locus and then selecting for excision of one of the two copies. If the mutant gene does not strongly impair growth, screening cells that have undergone deletion by homologous recombination should yield roughly similar numbers of excision events that remove the wild type or mutant copy. That was the case. Additionally, sequencing revealed no additional mutations in the mutant rpt other than that introduced to mutate tyrosine to alanine. Consequently, recovery and viability of the six mutant strains is unlikely to be dependent on secondary extra- or intragenic mutations. We tested growth under a variety of conditions (Fig. 1A). Dilution assays on YPD plates revealed relatively minor effects upon incubation at 30 °C. rpt6 was most impaired in growth, and rpt1 less so. At 37 °C, a temperature that provides heat stress for yeast, rpt1 and rpt6 were most strongly impaired. Canavanine is an arginine analog that is incorporated into proteins and causes their misfolding, which stresses the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The presence of canavanine at 30 °C caused strong growth impairment in rpt6 and almost as strong an effect in rpt1. Last, we tested the effect of low dose cycloheximide. This inhibitor of protein synthesis has been observed to stimulate the growth or viability of cells with impairments of proteasome function (19.Gerlinger U.M. Gückel R. Hoffmann M. Wolf D.H. Hilt W. Yeast cycloheximide-resistant crl mutants are proteasome mutants defective in protein degradation.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 2487-2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Without cycloheximide, rpt6 grew less well than wild type; in its presence, the growth of rpt6 was similar to that of wild type. Plate dilution assays provide a measure of growth and viability in a specific culture milieu. To test the generality of these results, cells also were grown in suspension YPD culture with vigorous aeration at 30 °C. Growth was monitored by turbidity at A600. Cell density exhibited the classic time-dependent growth phases: rapid fermentative growth, a pause and resumption of growth at a reduced rate, and finally slowly approaching a fixed terminal density as nutrient sources are depleted (Fig. 1B). The growth of the mutants, except rpt3 and rpt6, was not distinguishable from wild type. The rpt6 cells grew slowly. More striking was the pattern of rpt3, which appeared to grow faster than wild type; its doubling times were 1.5 and 6.8 h before and after the shift, compared with 1.7 and 14.0 h for wild type. Hemocytometer counts (data not shown) were concordant with the A600 turbidity data; by both measures, rpt3 cell number at terminal density was about 200–300% greater than wild type. However, at terminal density, rpt3 cellular dry weight, despite the much higher cell count, was only 40% greater than that of wild type. This comparison suggested that rpt3 completes its cell cycle faster and divides at a smaller size. To test that directly, we measured cell size by Coulter Counter (Fig. 1C). During both fermentative and aerobic growth, rpt3 cells were indeed smaller than wild type. The modal diameters of rpt3 versus wild type in fermentative growth were 3.25 and 3.75 μm, respectively. The corresponding modal sizes after cells reached stationary phase were 3.25 and 4.25 μm. Linear dimension ratios must be cubed to infer relative volume. rpt3 volume is 65% of wild type during exponential growth and 45% in lag phase. Fast growth to small size has been extensively described in fungal mutants and in S. cerevisiae has been denoted as the whi phenotype. Cells with impairments in proteasome function typically accumulate a population of high molecular weight ubiquitin-conjugated proteins (20.Hilt W. Enenkel C. Gruhler A. Singer T. Wolf D.H. The PRE4 gene codes for a subunit of the yeast proteasome necessary for peptidylglutamyl-peptide-hydrolyzing activity.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 3479-3486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested cell extracts to assess the relative amount of such ubiquitin-modified proteins. Western blotting (Fig. 2A) revealed that, compared with wild type, all of the mutants contained increased amounts of high molecular weight ubiquitin-conjugated proteins. Among the mutants, rpt3, rpt4, and rpt5 were most markedly elevated. Qualitatively similar results were seen in three independent experiments. To test the ability of mutant cells to degrade a proteasome substrate, we assessed the steady-state level of mouse ODC. This heterologous protein was chosen for the following reasons. Its proteasomal degradation is independent of ubiquitination (21.Murakami Y. Matsufuji S. Kameji T. Hayashi S. Igarashi K. Tamura T. Tanaka K. Ichihara A. Ornithine decarboxylase is degraded by the 26S proteasome without ubiquitination.Nature. 1992; 360: 597-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). This removes secondary changes in ubiquitin pools and their partitioning as a factor in turnover. Proteasomes and their associated proteins perform editing of ubiquitin conjugates (22.Crosas B. Hanna J. Kirkpatrick D.S. Zhang D.P. Tone Y. Hathaway N.A. Buecker C. Leggett D.S. Schmidt M. King R.W. Gygi S.P. Finley D. Ubiquitin chains are remodeled at the proteasome by opposing ubiquitin ligase and deubiquitinating activities.Cell. 2006; 127: 1401-1413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Using a substrate that does not depend on ubiquitin reduces the effects of such potential changes and focuses experimental observations on determinants of processing rates. ODC is a tightly folded protein (23.Kern A.D. Oliveira M.A. Coffino P. Hackert M.L. Structure of mammalian ornithine decarboxylase at 1.6 Å resolution. Stereochemical implications of PLP-dependent amino acid decarboxylases.Structure. 1999; 7: 567-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). It therefore provides a stringent test of whether mutations impair translocation and unfolding (24.Hoyt M.A. Zich J. Takeuchi J. Zhang M. Govaerts C. Coffino P. Glycine-alanine repeats impair proper substrate unfolding by the proteasome.EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1720-1729Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Finally, mouse ODC has a very short half-life in yeast, providing a sensitive test of any change in its turnover (25.Hoyt M.A. Zhang M. Coffino P. Ubiquitin-independent mechanisms of mouse ornithine decarboxylase degradation are conserved between mammalian and fungal cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12135-12143Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). FLAG-tagged ODC was expressed, and its relative level was determined by anti-FLAG Western blotting (Fig. 2B). rpt4 and rpt5 had strikingly increased amounts of ODC, compared with wild type or with rpt1, rpt2, and rpt3, which were similar to wild type. In rpt6, no ODC was detected under the conditions used. Proteasomal degradation is by far the dominant determinant of ODC steady-state and the principal mechanism of its metabolic regulation (26.van Daalen Wetters T. Macrae M. Brabant M. Sittler A. Coffino P. Polyamine-mediated regulation of mouse ornithine decarboxylase is posttranslational.Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5484-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). These data are therefore consistent with the conclusion that the rpt4 and rpt5 cells have a reduced rate of ODC turnover, whereas rpt6 has increased degradation compared with wild type. Based on the nature of the rpt mutants and the data presented thus far, it is plausible that these have an impairment in the ubiquitin-proteasome system and that such defects may be localized to proteasomes. To assess this, we fractionated cellular extracts on native gels and used an in-gel assay that depends on hydrolysis of a fluorogenic peptide by proteasomes (Fig. 3A). These gels resolved proteasomes that are singly capped (one regulatory complex per 20S catalytic complex) from those that are doubly capped (two regulatory complexes per 20S catalytic complex). In all of the extracts, the doubly capped form predominated, whereas lesser amounts of the singly capped form were also evident. Strikingly and reproducibly in multiple independent experiments, less rpt5 was observed to be present or active in crude extracts compared with all of the other rpt mutants and wild type. However, the mobility of the rpt5 proteasomes was not obviously different. Because of the relatively weak rpt5 signal, the presence or absence of the singly capped form in crude extracts could not be determined. Furthermore, Rpn11 is present in our strains with a FLAG tag, which is used for affinity purification (see below). The tagged form of Rpn11 is evident in the denaturing SDS-PAGE Western blot of ODC abundance (Fig. 2A) and there acts as a loading control. The amount of Rpn11p recovered from crude extracts is not diminished by the rpt5 mutation, suggesting that the reduced amount of rpt5 proteasomes observed by native gel functional analysis results from 26S disassembly associated with the cell breakage conditions used to prepare crude extracts for native gel analysis. To further determine the composition of the proteasomes and to perform biochemical experiments, we used the FLAG tag on the Rpn11p protein for affinity purification. Proteasomes of high purity were recovered. SDS-PAGE analysis of these revealed no marked differences between wild type and mutants in the conventional pattern of proteins (Fig. 3B). The nature of the affinity purification and the position of the tag utilized should recover doubly and singly capped proteasomes as well as free regulatory complexes. Native activity gels of the purified proteasomes (Fig. 3C) revealed results congruent with those observed in crude extracts. However, as equal amounts of purified proteasome were loaded, rpt5 was no longer underrepresented. Additionally, the cleaner backgrounds and larger amounts of the active protein more readily revealed variations in the ratio of singly to doubly capped forms. In all cases the doubly capped form predominated, but this was the exclusive form observed with the purified rpt5 proteasomes. Additionally, rpt1 and rpt2 showed ratios of the two forms that more strongly favored doubly capped proteasomes. After Coomassie staining (Fig. 3D), we observed that the rpt5 singly capped form was replaced by a non-active form corresponding in mobility to free 19S. We cannot confidently ascribe these different ratios among the rpt mutants to conditions of assembly present in cells or as a consequence of purification. In any case, the overall data support the conclusion that wild type and mutant purified proteasomes have a similar structure (forms other than doubly capped 26S are barely detectable by Coomassie staining), and their biochemical activities can be appropriately compared. Unfolding and translocation of proteins by the proteasome depend on ATP. ATP binding (by the Walker A motif) and hydrolysis (Walker B motif) have been shown in other ATPases to produce conformational changes that are propagated to effecter elements; their action in turn moves or disassembles substrates. These general findings assure that the Ar-Φ loops move in coordination with one or more steps of the ATP binding and hydrolysis cycle. Because changes in these structures are coupled, mutating the Rpt Ar-Φ loops could affect ATP hydrolysis. We tested this by measuring the ATPase activity of the mutants (Fig. 4). Quantitative differences were observed. In rpt4 proteasomes, the rate of ATP hydrolysis decreased by 30%. Surprisingly, in all of the other rpt mutants, activity increased compared with wild type. In the most extreme case, rpt1 activity increased by about 120%. These findings suggest that Ar-Φ loops have, in the absence of substrate, a regulatory function that constrains the tempo of ATP hydrolysis. Aside from its apparent regulatory effects on ATPase activity, the Ar-Φ loops and their conserved tyrosines act to contact substrate proteins, propelling their translocation and unfolding. These processes can be rate-limiting, especially for tightly folded substrate proteins (9.Henderson A. Erales J. Hoyt M.A. Coffino P. Dependence of proteasome processing rate on substrate unfolding.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 17495-17502Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We therefore compared"

The neutral LAPs (LAP-N and its orthologs) are constitutively expressed and detected in all plants, whereas the stress-induced acidic LAPs (LAP-A) are expressed only in a subset of the Solanaceae. LAPs have a role in insect defense and act as a regulator of the late branch of wound signaling in Solanum lycopersicum (tomato). Although the mechanism of LAP-A action is unknown, it has been presumed that LAP peptidase activity is essential for regulating wound signaling. Here we show that plant LAPs are bifunctional. Using three assays to monitor protein protection from heat-induced damage, it was shown that the tomato LAP-A and LAP-N and the Arabidopsis thaliana LAP1 and LAP2 are molecular chaperones. Assays using LAP-A catalytic site mutants demonstrated that LAP-A chaperone activity was independent of its peptidase activity. Furthermore, disruption of the LAP-A hexameric structure increased chaperone activity. Together, these data identify a new class of molecular chaperones and a new function for the plant LAPs as well as suggesting new mechanisms for LAP action in the defense of solanaceous plants against stress.

Mutations in the cone CNG channel subunits CNGA3 and CNGB3 account for >70% of all known cases of achromatopsia. Cones degenerate in achromatopsia patients and in CNGA3(-/-) and CNGB3(-/-) mice. This work investigates the molecular basis of cone degeneration in CNG channel deficiency. As cones comprise only 2-3% of the total photoreceptor population in the wild-type mouse retina, we generated mouse lines with CNG channel deficiency on a cone-dominant background, i.e. CNGA3(-/-)/Nrl(-/-) and CNGB3(-/-)/Nrl(-/-) mice. The retinal phenotype and potential cell death pathways were examined by functional, biochemical, and immunohistochemical approaches. CNGA3(-/-)/Nrl(-/-) and CNGB3(-/-)/Nrl(-/-) mice showed impaired cone function, opsin mislocalization, and cone degeneration similar to that in the single knock-out mice. The endoplasmic reticulum stress marker proteins, including Grp78/Bip, phospho-eIF2α, phospho-IP(3)R, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein, were elevated significantly in CNGA3(-/-)/Nrl(-/-) and CNGB3(-/-)/Nrl(-/-) retinas, compared with the age-matched (postnatal 30 days) Nrl(-/-) controls. Along with these, up-regulation of the cysteine protease calpains and cleavage of caspase-12 and caspase-7 were found in the channel-deficient retinas, suggesting an endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated apoptosis. In addition, we observed a nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and endonuclease G in CNGA3(-/-)/Nrl(-/-) and CNGB3(-/-)/Nrl(-/-) retinas, implying a mitochondrial insult in the endoplasmic reticulum stress-activated cell death process. Taken together, our findings suggest a crucial role of endoplasmic reticulum stress in cone degeneration associated with CNG channel deficiency."
https://openalex.org/W2057646898,"Three major laminin and collagen-binding integrins in skin (α6β4, α3β1, and α2β1) are involved in keratinocyte adhesion to the dermis and dissemination of skin cells during wound healing and/or tumorigenesis. Knockdown of α6 integrin in keratinocytes not only results in motility defects but also leads to decreased surface expression of the α2, α3, and β4 integrin subunits. Whereas α2 integrin mRNA levels are decreased in α6 integrin knockdown cells, α3 and β4 integrin mRNAs levels are unaffected. Expression of either α6 or α3 integrin in α6 integrin knockdown cells restores α2 integrin mRNA levels. Moreover, re-expression of α6 integrin increases β4 integrin protein at the cell surface, which results in an increase in α3 integrin expression via activation of initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1. Our data indicate that the α6β4 integrin is a master regulator of transcription and translation of other integrin subunits and underscore its pivotal role in wound healing and cancer."

However, currently available lectins, mostly derived from plants, have an apparent drawback in their “repertoire,” lacking some critical probes, such as those for sulfated glycans. Therefore, engineering lectins on the basis of existing ones toward novel sugar-binding activity would be of great practical value. In directing lectin evolution, choosing an appropriate protein scaffold as a starting template is crucial. R-type lectins containing a ricin-B chain-like carbohydrate recognition domain are widely distributed in bacteria, plants, and animals. Notably, most of the R-type lectins bind Gal/GalNAc, but some have evolved to bind their derivatives, e.g. Neu5Acα2–6Gal/GalNAc (18Shibuya N. Goldstein I.J. Broekaert W.F. Nsimba-Lubaki M. Peeters B. Peumans W.J. The elderberry (Sambucus nigra L.) bark lectin recognizes the Neu5Ac(α 2–6)Gal/GalNAc sequence.J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 1596-1601Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kaku H.

EW29Ch is the C-terminal domain of earthworm 29-kDa Gal-binding protein (EW29) that contains two R-type domains in tandem (20Hirabayashi J. Dutta S.K. Kasai K. Novel galactose-binding proteins in Annelida. Characterization of 29-kDa tandem repeat-type lectins from the earthworm Lumbricus terrestris.J. Biol.

Recombinant EW29Ch is stable and can be easily produced in Escherichia coli, allowing it to be used for the purpose of engineering. In fact, we have previously tailored a novel α2–6-linked sialic acid-binding lectin from EW29Ch by a procedure consisting of error-prone PCR and a reinforced ribosome display method (21Yabe R. Suzuki R. Kuno A. Fujimoto Z. Jigami Y. Hirabayashi J. Tailoring a novel sialic acid-binding lectin from a ricin-B chain-like galactose-binding protein by natural evolution-mimicry.J. Biochem. 2007; 141: 389-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In this study, we greatly improved the basic strategy by incorporating a high-throughput screening system, i.e. a glycoconjugate microarray on the basis of an evanescent field fluorescence-assisted detection principle (22Tateno H.

As a result, a series of mutant lectins showing a novel affinity for 6S-Gal-terminated glycans were selected. Most had a mutation at Glu-20 to Lys in common. Moreover, a single point mutation (E20K) proved to be sufficient to acquire this novel specificity. Finally, the E20K mutant was shown to be useful for in vivo experiments to detect the 6S-Gal glycoepitope in KSST-transfected cells. pET27b-FLAG-EW29Ch containing an N-terminal FLAG tag before the EW29Ch coding sequence and pET27b-FLAG-EW29Ch-bio containing a C-terminal biotinylation sequence after FLAG-EW29Ch were prepared as described in detail in the supplemental information. Generation of an EW29Ch random mutagenesis library was carried out as described previously (21Yabe R. Suzuki R. Kuno A. Fujimoto Z. Jigami Y. Hirabayashi J.

In some cases, preblocking with excessive lactose (10 mm) was carried out before selection by carbohydrate polymer-coated beads. After the selection, bound mRNA was purified, reverse-transcribed, and amplified with a one-step RNA PCR kit (Takara). The derived cDNA fragment was ready for the next round of selection and cloning. The sugar-binding activity of selected EW29Ch mutants was analyzed by glycoconjugate microarray on the basis of methods described previously (22Tateno H. Mori A. Uchiyama N. Yabe R. Iwaki J.

Briefly, N-terminal FLAG-tagged wild-type EW29Ch or EW29Ch mutants, in some cases containing a C-terminal biotinylation sequence, were expressed in BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL and purified using a lactosyl-Sepharose column. Biotinylation of purified proteins with a C-terminal biotinylation sequence was carried out as described previously using biotin ligase BirA (23Hu D. Kamiya Y. Totani K. Kamiya D. Kawasaki N.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the Accuprime TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) following the protocol of the manufacturer. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The primers used are described in the supplemental information. FAC was performed as described previously (24Tateno H. Nakamura-Tsuruta S. Hirabayashi J. Frontal affinity chromatography.

Briefly, EW29Ch or its mutant recombinant proteins were immobilized on N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose Fast Flow (GE Healthcare) and packed into a miniature column (inner diameter, 2 mm; length, 10 mm; bed volume, 31.4 μl; Shimadzu). A panel of pyridylamino (PA)-labeled sulfated glycans was successively injected into the columns. The elution front of each PA glycan relative to that of the control (Man5GlcNAc2-PA), referred to as V-V0, was then determined. The dissociation constant Kd was then calculated as described previously (24Tateno H. Nakamura-Tsuruta S. Hirabayashi J. Frontal affinity chromatography. Sugar-protein interactions.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 2529-2537Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). CHO cells were maintained in RPMI1640 supplemented with 5% FBS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Transfection of CHO cells with KSST or GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase (Gn6ST) or cotransfection with KSST and Gn6ST was performed using Lipofectamine LTX (Invitrogen). After 24 h, cells were harvested, and the binding of 5D4, wild type EW29Ch, and E20K was analyzed by flow cytometry. Briefly, 1 × 105 cells were incubated with 5D4 (diluted 500-fold), 10 μg/ml biotinylated EW29Ch, or E20K on ice for 20 min followed by 2 μg/ml Dylight 488-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) and 10 μg/ml Cy3-labeled streptavidin (Jackson ImmunoResearch). The binding of lectins to cells was analyzed by FACSCanto-II cytometer (BD Biosciences). For tunicamycin or swainsonine treatment, KSST-transfected cells were incubated with 1 μg/ml tunicamycin and 5 μg/ml swainsonine for 12 h before analysis, respectively. For sialidase treatment, cells were incubated with 25 milliunits of Arthrobacter ureafaciens sialidase at 37 °C for 30 min. In our previous study, a ribosome display method along an error-prone PCR was used to direct evolution of EW29Ch for α2–6-sialic acid-binding lectin. Selection of the target sialic acid-binding mutants was carried out using fetuin-coupled Sepharose beads as this glycoprotein is rich in terminal α2–6 sialic acid. To date, no glycoproteins that carry a mass of 6S-Gal-terminated glycans have been available, and even if there are any, they must be highly heterogeneous in a glycan structure. There is also a possibility that glycoproteins interact with the ribosome complex in their protein backbone, which would generate a “false positive” during selection. In this study, we used commercially available biotinylated carbohydrate polymers with a defined, homogeneous glycan structure as bait ligands for selection. To test the feasibility of these carbohydrate polymers, we first compared the selection of wild-type EW29Ch by the target glycan N-acetyl-lactosamine-polyacrylamide (LN-PAA) and the non-target glycan mannose-polyacrylamide. As shown in supplemental Fig. S1A, LN-PAA-coated beads precipitated EW29Ch (in the form of a complex with mRNA) in a manner dependent on the amount of immobilized glycans. On the other hand, the nonspecific binding caused by the intact streptavidin beads themselves was gradually reduced as the increment of immobilized non-target mannose-polyacrylamide. It is highly possible that the hydrophilic carbohydrate polymers on the surface of the beads could inhibit the nonspecific interactions between ribosome complex and streptavidin-coated beads. At a concentration of 100 μg/ml, mannose-polyacrylamide beads did not substantially precipitate EW29Ch, whereas LN-PAA did so maximally. These results demonstrated the good selectivity of the carbohydrate polymers for the selection of lectins. Having established suitable selection conditions, we attempted high-throughput screening of the desired mutants. We had previously used FAC, a quantitative method for determination of affinity constants (Ka) between lectins and glycans. However, this approach requires relatively large amounts of “purified” proteins and is time-consuming. In this study, we adopted a more advanced glycoconjugate microarray system that is based on a unique, evanescent field-assisted fluorescence detection principle (22Tateno H. Mori A. Uchiyama N. Yabe R. Iwaki J. Shikanai T. Angata T. Narimatsu H. Hirabayashi J. Glycoconjugate microarray based on an evanescent-field fluorescence-assisted detection principle for investigation of glycan-binding proteins.Glycobiology. 2008; 18: 789-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The method is directly applicable to crude extracts containing glycan-binding proteins with the aid of fluorescence-labeled specific antibodies. To examine the suitability of this method, wild-type EW29Ch fused with an N-terminal FLAG tag was expressed in E. coli, and the cells containing this protein were lysed. The expression of the target protein was visualized by SDS-PAGE, and the protein with a FLAG tag was confirmed by Western blotting using an anti-FLAG M2 antibody (supplemental Fig. S1B). Further, the cell extract was probed by incubation with anti-FLAG M2 antibody followed by Cy3-labeled secondary antibody. An aliquot of the labeled complex (EW29Ch/anti-FLAG M2 antibody/Cy3-labeled secondary antibody) was applied to the array, and the binding was monitored by an evanescent-type scanner at equilibrium without washing steps. As shown in supplemental Fig. S1C, clear binding signals were observed in FLAG-EW29Ch- expressed cells but not in a negative control (without isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction), suggesting that the binding is specific to FLAG-EW29Ch. Notably, the binding profile was almost the same as that of the purified EW29Ch. All these data indicate that the glycoconjugate microarray should provide a better means to analyze the sugar-binding specificity of the selected mutants in a rapid, sensitive, and high-throughput manner. Having refined the engineering strategy, we performed random mutagenesis targeting the open reading frame of EW29Ch. Error-prone PCR was conducted under conditions where approximately six mutations per gene were introduced. The resultant mutant library was then selected against a sulfated carbohydrate polymer, 6′-sulfo-N-acetyllactosamine-polyacrylamide (6′-Sulfo-LN-PAA). Although the wild-type EW29Ch has an almost undetectable level of affinity to 6S-Gal-terminated glycans (described later), 6′-Sulfo-LN-PAA still precipitated a considerable amount of wild-type and wild-type-like (neutral) mutants, possibly because they still have a significantly enhanced affinity toward multivalent carbohydrate polymers. To reduce this undesired interaction, we added excessive lactose to the selection system before mixing with 6′-Sulfo-LN-PAA-coated beads. On the basis of this concept, we first incubated the mutant library with excessive lactose (10 mm) for 1 h and then with 6′-Sulfo-LN-coated beads. As a result, the enriched population in the presence of lactose showed a large reduction in the RT-PCR product (background noise) after the first round of selection, probably because of bulk elimination of the undesired background binding of the wild type and its neutral mutants (Fig. 1A, upper panel). The obtained fraction was subjected to another round of ribosome display selection against 6′-Sulfo-LN. The enriched population no longer showed a substantial difference in the RT-PCR analysis regardless of the presence or absence of lactose (Fig. 1A, lower panel). This observation strongly suggests that some mutants with target specificity (6′-Sulfo-LN) were enriched. To confirm this, isolated mRNA after two rounds of selection was reverse-transcribed, and the derived cDNA was treated with NdeI and XhoI to insert the coding fragment into pET27b containing an N-terminal FLAG tag. Twenty clones randomly selected were sequenced. As a common feature, 14 clones (1–14) were found to carry the mutation E20K in common in the α subdomain, and six had E68K in the β subdomain (Fig. 1B). These mutants were expressed in E. coli, and 12 were successfully expressed (1–8 and 15–18). The sugar-binding activity of the 12 mutants was analyzed by a glycoconjugate microarray consisting of eight related sugars (results of the wild-type and 4 are shown in Fig. 1C). Their relative affinity for 6′-Sulfo-LN was calculated by normalizing the signal with LN (Fig. 1D). Eight of the 12 mutants (1–8) carrying the mutation E20K exhibited a specific affinity for 6′-Sulfo-LN, whereas the rest of the clones (15–18) without this mutation lacked such affinity. Therefore, the point mutation E20K was strongly suggested as being important for the binding with 6′-Sulfo-LN. To assess the sugar-binding affinity of the derived mutants from a more quantitative aspect, two representative mutants (1 and 4) were purified to apparent homogeneity in SDS-PAGE and were subjected to FAC analysis as described previously (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S2). Both mutants as well as the wild-type EW29Ch displayed a similar affinity to Gal-terminated glycans (901 and 902), i.e. in terms of Kd, 2 × 10−5 m. However, the two mutants exhibited a greatly increased affinity to a 6-sulfo-Gal-terminated glycan (922) (Kd = 3∼4 × 10−6 m) to which the wild-type EW29Ch showed no substantial affinity. Notably, no detectable affinity was shown to the related structures, including 3-sulfo-Gal (918), Neu5Acα2–6-Gal (704), and 6-sulfo-GlcNAc (924). A greatly reduced affinity to 923, the non-reducing terminally unsulfated structure of 922, unambiguously confirms the importance of 6-sulfation of Gal in the lacto-N-neotetraose structure (902). Comparison of the affinity toward a panel of 129 PA-labeled glycans (supplemental Fig. S3) revealed that EW29Ch and 4 have almost the same binding profiles except for terminal 6S-Gal glycan (922) (supplemental Fig. S2). These results show that the mutants (1 and 4) have acquired a novel affinity to 6S-Gal. Although the above results indicate that E20K (14 of 20) plays a critical role for the 6S-Gal binding, the exact contribution of E20K is not clear, especially as another mutation E68K (5 of 14) often accompanied the E20K mutation. Mutants E20K, E68K, and the double mutant E20K/E68K were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis, and their sugar-binding specificities were analyzed by FAC (Fig. 3). As expected, the binding profiles of E20K were quite similar to those of the two mutants, 1 and 4, described above (compare with Fig. 2). E20K exhibited a much higher affinity to a 6S-Gal-terminated glycan (922) compared with a corresponding non-sulfated glycan (923). On the other hand, binding of E68K to the 6S-Gal-terminated glycan was not observed, and the double mutant E20K/E68K showed a similar profile to that of E20K. These results indicate that E68K is not essential for 6S-Gal recognition. The results also prompted us to investigate whether mutation of Glu-20 to other basic residues could acquire the target activity. For this, E20R and E20H were prepared, and their sugar-binding activities were analyzed by glycoconjugate microarray. As shown in supplemental Fig. S4, E20R exhibited a comparable binding ability for 6′-Sulfo-LN to E20K, whereas E20H only slightly enhanced the affinity to 6′-Sulfo-LN. Taken together, these results show that the presence of a strong basic residue (Lys or Arg) at position 20 is necessary and sufficient for the acquisition of a novel affinity to 6S-Gal. To determine whether these mutants are of practical use for detecting 6S-Gal-terminated glycans in complex samples, CHO cells were transfected with a 6S-Gal catalyzing enzyme, KSST. Because KSST preferentially adds a sulfate group to Gal adjacent to a sulfated GlcNAc (5Torii T. Fukuta M. Habuchi O.

Cotransfection of KSST with Gn6ST not only enhances the expression of 6S-Gal but also that of highly sulfated KS that can be recognized by a specific antibody, 5D4 (26Mehmet H. Scudder P. Tang P.W.

https://openalex.org/W2005575542,"Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are crucial in macrophage phagocytosis, which is pivotal in host innate immune response. However, the detailed mechanism is not fully defined. Here, we demonstrated that the induction of Src and Eps8 in LPS-treated macrophages was TLR4- and MyD88-dependent, and their attenuation reduced LPS-promoted phagocytosis. Confocal microscopy indicated the colocalization of Eps8 and TLR4 in the cytosol and at the phagosome. Consistently, both Eps8 and TLR4 were present in the same immunocomplex regardless of LPS stimulation. Inhibition of this complex formation by eps8 siRNA or overexpression of pleckstrin homology domain-truncated Eps8 (i.e. 261-p97(Eps8)) decreased LPS-induced TLR4-MyD88 interaction and the following activation of Src, focal adhesion kinase, and p38 MAPK. Importantly, attenuation of Eps8 impaired the bacterium-killing ability of macrophages. Thus, Eps8 is a key regulator of the LPS-stimulated TLR4-MyD88 interaction and contributes to macrophage phagocytosis."

We used the translational inhibitor cycloheximide to analyze turnover and observed that the stability of the PAA2 protein was decreased in plants grown with elevated Cu. Interestingly, PAA2 protein abundance was significantly increased in paa1 mutants, in which the Cu content in the chloroplast is half of that of the wild-type, due to impaired Cu import into the organelle. In contrast in a pc2 insertion mutant, which has strongly reduced plastocyanin expression, the PAA2 protein levels were low regardless of Cu addition to the growth media. Together, these data indicate that plastid Cu levels control PAA2 stability and that plastocyanin, which is the target of PAA2 mediated Cu delivery in thylakoids, is a major determinant of this regulatory mechanism.

https://openalex.org/W2016440300,"GPR41 is a G protein-coupled receptor activated by short chain fatty acids. The gene encoding GPR41 is located immediately downstream of a related gene encoding GPR40, a receptor for long chain fatty acids. Expression of GPR41 has been reported in a small number of cell types, including gut enteroendocrine cells and sympathetic ganglia, where it may play a role in the maintenance of metabolic homeostasis. We now demonstrate that GPR41, like GPR40, is expressed in pancreatic beta cells. Surprisingly, we found no evidence for transcriptional control elements or transcriptional initiation in the intergenic GPR40-GPR41 region. Rather, using 5'-rapid amplification of cDNA ends analysis, we demonstrated that GPR41 is transcribed from the promoter of the GPR40 gene. We confirmed this finding by generating bicistronic luciferase reporter plasmids, and we were able to map a potential internal ribosome entry site-containing region to a 2474-nucleotide region of the intergenic sequence. Consistent with this, we observed m(7)G cap-independent reporter gene expression upon transfection of RNA containing this region. Thus, GPR41 expression is mediated via an internal ribosome entry site located in the intergenic region of a bicistronic mRNA. This novel sequence organization may be utilized to permit coordinated regulation of the fatty acid receptors GPR40 and GPR41."

To further characterize the role of nitrite, we developed a system that oxidizes nitrite to nitrate to eliminate nitrite contamination.

https://openalex.org/W2058735130,"A self-consistent model of β-mannan oligosaccharides bound to a monoclonal antibody, C3.1, that protects mice against Candida albicans has been developed through chemical mapping, NMR spectroscopic, and computational studies. This antibody optimally binds di- and trisaccharide epitopes, whereas larger oligomers bind with affinities that markedly decrease with increasing chain length. The (1→2)-β-linked di-, tri-, and tetramannosides bind in helical conformations similar to the solution global minimum. Antibody recognition of the di- and trisaccharide is primarily dependent on the mannose unit at the reducing end, with the hydrophobic face of this sugar being tightly bound. Recognition of a tetrasaccharide involves a frameshift in the ligand interaction, shown by strong binding of the sugar adjacent to the reducing end. We show that frameshifting may also be deliberately induced by chemical modifications. Molecular recognition patterns similar to that of mAb C3.1, determined by saturation transfer difference-NMR, were also observed in polyclonal sera from rabbits immunized with a trisaccharide glycoconjugate. The latter observation points to the importance of internal residues as immunodominant epitopes in (1→2)-β-mannans and to the viability of a glycoconjugate vaccine composed of a minimal length oligosaccharide hapten."

Here, we showed that DPAA promoted GAC protein degradation without affecting GAC transcription and translation. Moreover, DPAA-induced GAC proteolysis was mediated by mitochondrial Lon protease. DPAA insolubilized 0.5% Triton X-100-soluble GAC protein and promoted the accumulation of insoluble GAC in Lon protease knockdown cells.

Dang C.V. c-Myc suppression of miR-23a/b enhances mitochondrial glutaminase expression and glutamine metabolism.Nature. 2009; 458: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar) reported that c-Myc oncogenic transcription factor, which is known to regulate microRNAs and stimulate cell proliferation, transcriptionally repressed miR-23a and miR23b, resulting in greater expression of their target protein, mitochondrial glutaminase (GLS1), in human cancer cells. These observations suggested the possibility that GAC was translationally regulated in tumor cells expressing c-Myc. The human KGA gene is located in chromosome 2, and its transcript is translated in the cytosol as a preprotein containing an N-terminal amino acid signal sequence that directs its import to the mitochondrial matrix. Upon import, the presequence is processed by mitochondrial peptidases to yield a mature form. Matured proteins are associated with each other to form a tetrameric complex (11.Aledo J.C.

In the mammalian mitochondrial matrix, three ATP-dependent proteolytic complexes, mammalian homologues of bacterial FtsH, ClpXP, and Lon, have been identified. Like the cytosolic 26 S proteasome, these proteases were considered to be members of the AAA+ (ATPases associated with a wide variety of cellular activities) protein superfamily (15.Ogura T.

FtsH, which is a membrane-bound zinc metalloprotease identified in bacteria, is localized in the mammalian mitochondrial inner membrane and plays a role in the turnover of inner membrane-embedded proteins (15.Ogura T.

ClpP holoenzymes, which have also been identified in bacteria, consist of soluble two-component systems composed of the same proteolytic component (ClpP) and different ATPase chaperon components (ClpA or ClpX). Different from bacterial ClpAP and ClpXP, which recognize and degrade the SsrA-tagged substrate, the mammalian ClpA homologue has not been identified, and the roles of ClpXP and its substrate are not fully understood because a covalent modification like SsrA tag or ubiquitin that targets specific proteins for degradation has not been discovered in mammalian mitochondria (15.Ogura T.

Among these proteases, Lon is associated with protein quality control because Lon protease exhibits ATP-dependent degradation of proteins that are damaged, mutated, or display non-native conformations.

In this study, to understand the overall mechanisms of down-regulation of GAC induced by DPAA, GAC was investigated at the levels of transcription, translation, and post-translation, respectively, in cultured human cells. The results showed that GAC was post-translationally regulated by DPAA, and mitochondrial Lon protease plays an important role in this regulation. DPAA was purchased from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). MG132, lactacystin, and epoxomicin were purchased from Peptide Institute, Inc. (Osaka, Japan). Polyclonal anti-KGA/GAC antiserum was prepared as described previously (2.Kita K. Suzuki T. Ochi T.

Mouse monoclonal anti-β-actin antibody, rabbit polyclonal anti-voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) antibody, and mouse monoclonal anti-mtHsp70 antibody were purchased from Abcam plc (Cambridge, UK). Mouse monoclonal anti-peroxiredoxin III antibody was purchased from LabFrontier Co. Ltd. (Gyeonggi-do, Korea). Rabbit polyclonal anti-LONP1 was purchased from Sigma. Mouse monoclonal anti CLPP antibody was purchased from Abnova Corp. (Taipei, Taiwan). Mouse monoclonal anti-HSP60 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., and peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. ECL Plus Western blotting detection system and protein A-Sepharose beads were purchased from GE Healthcare. EXPRE35S35S protein labeling mix was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Cells of the human hepatocarcinoma cell line, HepG2, were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Biowest, Nuaillé, France) under standard culture conditions at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in humidified air. Total RNA was extracted using the GeneElute mammalian total RNA miniprep kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was prepared using the Superscript III first-stranded synthesis system (Invitrogen). The primers used were as follows: GAC-F, 5′-GGTCTCCTCCTCTGGATAAGATGG-3′, and GAC-R, 5′-GATGTCCTCATTTGACTCAGGTGAC-3′; GAPDH-F, 5′-CCACCCATGGCAAATTCCATGGCA-3′, GAPDH-R, 5′-TCTAGACGGCAGGTCAGGTCCACC-3′. Reaction mix was prepared using SYBR Premix Ex TaqII (Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) and analyzed by the ABI 7500 real time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). All PCRs were performed in triplicate. HepG2 cells were cultured for 24 h in DPAA-containing medium, then washed, and incubated in 22 μCi of [35S]methionine-containing starvation medium (cysteine and methionine-free medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) dialyzed FBS (Invitrogen)) for 1 h. After thorough washings with PBS, cells were harvested and suspended in ice-cold RIPA buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) and kept on ice for 20 min. DNA and cellular debris were removed by centrifugation (15 min at 17,000 × g), and the protein content in the supernatant was determined and then subjected to an immunoprecipitation assay. 35S-Labeled GAC levels were analyzed with a Fuji Bio-Imaging analyzer (BAS-1000, Fuji Photo Film Co., Tokyo, Japan). Pulse-chase analysis was performed as described previously (28.Granot Z. Geiss-Friedlander R. Melamed-Book N. Eimerl S. Timberg R. Weiss A.M. Hales K.H. Hales D.B. Stocco D.M. Orly J. Proteolysis of normal and mutated steroidogenic acute regulatory proteins in the mitochondria. The fate of unwanted proteins.Mol. Endocrinol. 2003; 17: 2461-2476Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). HepG2 cells were cultured for 24 h and then incubated for 1 h in starvation medium (as described above). The medium was exchanged with 22 μCi of [35S]methionine-containing starvation medium and then incubated for 2 h. After removal of the radioactive medium, cells were washed and further incubated with 500 μm DPAA-containing medium for the indicated times. 35S-Labeled GAC proteins were collected by immunoprecipitation and analyzed with a Fuji Bio-Imaging analyzer. Anti-GAC/KGA antiserum was incubated with 400 μg of the cell lysate for 2 h in a revolving tube carousel at 4 °C. After this incubation, protein A-Sepharose beads were added to each sample, followed by a 4-h incubation in a revolving tube carousel at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 30 s at 4 °C; pelleted beads were washed three times, and the immune complex was released with 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and 5 min of boiling. To prepare the soluble fraction and insoluble membrane fraction, HepG2 cells were fractionated by differential extract buffer as described previously (30.Zhao Q. Wang J. Levichkin I.V. Stasinopoulos S. Ryan M.T. Hoogenraad N.J. A mitochondrial specific stress response in mammalian cells.EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4411-4419Crossref PubMed Scopus (706) Google Scholar). For the soluble fraction, HepG2 cells were suspended in Cell lysis buffer (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 10% ethylene glycol, 0.5% Triton X-100, and standard protease inhibitors (Sigma)) and separated by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected. Pellets, which were washed twice with Cell lysis buffer, were resuspended in whole cell extract buffer (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 10% ethylene glycol, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and standard protease inhibitors) and then sonified to obtain the insoluble membrane fraction. To prepare the total cell extract, cell pellets were suspended in whole cell extract buffer and then sonified. Protein contents of each fraction and extract were determined by the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce) using BSA as the standard. Protein samples were electrophoretically separated using 10% SDS-PAGE and then transferred onto a PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked overnight at 4 °C with 5% skim milk dissolved in TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 500 mm NaCl (TBS), containing 0.1% Tween 20). The membrane was then incubated with antibody for 6–16 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The blot was washed twice with TBS-T for 10 min and once for 5 min, and thereafter, the membrane was incubated with 1:20,000 diluted anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch) for 2 h at 4 °C. The blot was washed with TBS-T, and the membrane was developed using the ECL Plus immunoblotting detection system (GE Healthcare) and then analyzed with the LAS-3000 mini luminoimage analyzer (Fuji Photo Film Co.). siRNAs targeting human LONP (target sequence, GCGUCUUUCUAAAGAGAGA), human CLPP (target sequence, GGGCCAAGCCACAGACAUU), or negative control siRNA (sequence, AUCCGCGCGAUAGUACGUA) were purchased from B-Bridge International, Inc. Transfection of the siRNAs into HepG2 cells was performed using the LipofectamineTM RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty eight hours after siRNA transfection, cells were cultured in fresh growth medium for 40 h and then incubated with 500 μm DPAA-containing medium. After treatment with DPAA for the indicated time period, cells were harvested, and the expression levels of each protein were examined by immunoblot analyses. HepG2 cells were lysed in 80 μl of ice-cold DDM buffer (1% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside, 50 mm BisTris, pH 7.2, 0.5 m 6-aminocaproic acid, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.001% Ponceau S, and standard protease inhibitor) and 20 μl of ice-cold CHAPS buffer (5% CHAPS, 50 mm BisTris, pH 7.2, 0.5 m 6-aminocaproic acid, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.001% Ponceau S, and standard protease inhibitor). Insolubilized material was removed by centrifugation for 30 min at 20,000 × g. After addition of 6.5 μl of sample buffer (0.5% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, 10 mm BisTris, pH 7.2, 50 mm 6-aminocaproic acid, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm PMSF) to 13.1 μl of supernatant, 10 μl of the sample (protein concentration of 2 μg/μl) was analyzed directly by BN-PAGE. In short, a 4–16% polyacrylamide gradient gel (Invitrogen) was run in a cold room with pre-chilled dark blue cathode buffer (50 mm BisTris, 50 mm Tricine, pH 6.8, 0.02% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250) for 50 min at 150 V. The dark blue cathode buffer was changed for light blue cathode buffer (Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 changed to 0.002%) and continued to electrophoresis for 90–100 min until the dye front was leaked from the bottom of the gel. The same buffer without Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, was used for electrophoresis as an anode buffer. For Western blotting, the blue native gel was soaked in blot buffer (20 mm Bicine, 25 mm BisTris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.2) for 20 min, and denatured proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Bio-Rad) in the same buffer using the semi-dry blotting technique. Immunodecoration was according to standard procedures and was visualized by the ECL method (GE Healthcare). To understand the mechanism of GAC protein down-regulation by DPAA, we determined GAC mRNA levels after treatment with DPAA. HepG2 cells were incubated with 0, 250, and 500 μm DPAA for 4, 8, and 24 h; the total RNA was then extracted, and GAC mRNA levels were determined by quantitative real time PCR. As shown in Fig. 1A, no significant changes in GAC mRNA levels were observed in HepG2 cells incubated with various concentrations of DPAA for the specified times. A recent study indicated that GAC protein levels were post-transcriptionally regulated by microRNAs, and their translation was inhibited by these microRNAs (10.Gao P. Tchernyshyov I. Chang T.C. Lee Y.S. Kita K. Ochi T. Zeller K.I. De Marzo A.M. Van Eyk J.E. Mendell J.T. Dang C.V. c-Myc suppression of miR-23a/b enhances mitochondrial glutaminase expression and glutamine metabolism.Nature. 2009; 458: 762-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1582) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the effects of DPAA on GAC translation. The translational levels of GAC were assessed by [35S]methionine uptake in newly translated GAC proteins after treatment with DPAA. As shown in Fig. 1B, no significant changes in [35S]methionine-labeled GAC (35S-GAC) were observed by DPAA. To evaluate the effects of DPAA on GAC protein degradation, GAC protein turnover in HepG2 cells was investigated by pulse-chase analysis. For pulse labeling, HepG2 cells were incubated in [35S]methionine-containing medium for 2 h, and then the remaining 35S-GAC proteins were chased in the control and 500 μm DPAA-containing chase medium for up to 12 h. As shown in Fig. 1C, 80.1% of 35S-GAC proteins remained in HepG2 cells when incubated in the control chase medium for 12 h, whereas in the presence of DPAA, 35S-GAC levels decreased time-dependently, and only 25.9% of 35S-GAC proteins remained after 12 h of chase. As DPAA promoted the ubiquitination of cellular proteins (supplemental Fig. S1), we hypothesized that GAC proteolysis may be mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. To clarify this hypothesis, HepG2 cells were pretreated with proteasome inhibitors, and cellular GAC protein levels were determined after DPAA treatment. Each proteasome inhibitor was added to the medium 2 h before addition of 500 μm DPAA, and incubation was conducted for the indicated times. As shown in Fig. 2A (upper and middle panels), DPAA-induced decreases in GAC proteins at the time point of 12 h were partially blocked by pretreatment with MG132 and lactacystin. After a 12-h treatment with DPAA, only 44.8% of GAC proteins remained in the cells, whereas ∼80% of GAC proteins remained in cells pretreated with MG132 or lactacystin (Fig. 2B). In contrast, pretreatment with epoxomicin had no effect on DPAA-induced degradation of GAC (Fig. 2A, lower panels), and about 40% of GAC proteins remained in cells (Fig. 2B). To define the inhibitory effects of epoxomicin on proteasomes, the ubiquitination level of cellular proteins was evaluated by immunoblot analysis. Ubiquitination levels were significantly increased by epoxomicin treatment, and the effect was the same as the ubiquitination level of MG132 and lactacystin treatment (data not shown). Therefore, we concluded that epoxomicin could fully inhibit the proteasome. Previous studies showed that MG132 and lactacystin had inhibitory effects on Lon protease in addition to the inhibition of proteasome, although epoxomicin did not (28.Granot Z. Geiss-Friedlander R. Melamed-Book N. Eimerl S. Timberg R. Weiss A.M. Hales K.H. Hales D.B. Stocco D.M. Orly J. Proteolysis of normal and mutated steroidogenic acute regulatory proteins in the mitochondria.

Endocrinol. 2007; 21: 2164-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Therefore, partial inhibition by MG132 and lactacystin of DPAA-induced GAC degradation may be due to inhibition of Lon protease. To determine the involvement of Lon protease in GAC degradation caused by DPAA, the effects of siRNA Lon on the induction of GAC degradation were investigated. Double-stranded short oligonucleotides for human Lon protease mRNA (siRNA LON) were synthesized and transfected into HepG2 cells. After a 48-h transfection of siRNA LON in HepG2 cells, cellular Lon protease levels significantly decreased, and this decrease lasted for the following 72 h (data not shown). Thus, HepG2 cells transfected transiently with siRNA LON for 48 h and then incubated for 40 h in normal culture medium were used as “Lon protease knockdown cells.” As shown in Fig. 3A, GAC protein levels were significantly decreased by treatment with DPAA in control siRNA-transfected cells, whereas GAC protein levels in Lon protease knockdown cells were not changed by treatment with DPAA. In contrast, in the absence of DPAA treatment, GAC protein levels were not significantly changed in both control and Lon protease knockdown cells. To determine whether the promotion of GAC degradation by DPAA is due to Lon protease up-regulation, Lon protein expression levels were investigated. HepG2 cells were incubated with 500 μm DPAA for up to 24 h, and then cellular Lon protein levels were determined by immunoblot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3B, no changes in Lon protein levels were observed for up to 24 h after treatment w"

Here, we demonstrate the structural basis of this interaction for the CSD of HP1α. This mode of H3 binding is dependent on dimerization of the CSD and recognition of a PxVxL-like motif, as for other CSD partners. NMR chemical shift mapping showed that the H3 residues that mediate the CSD interaction occur in and adjacent to the αN helix just within the nucleosome core. Access to the binding region would require some degree of unwrapping of the DNA near the nucleosomal DNA entry/exit site."
https://openalex.org/W2016867284,"Human MutS homologue 2 (hMSH2), a crucial element of the highly conserved DNA mismatch repair system, maintains genetic stability in the nucleus of normal cells. Our previous studies indicate that hMSH2 is ectopically expressed on the surface of epithelial tumor cells and recognized by both T cell receptor γδ (TCRγδ) and natural killer group 2 member D (NKG2D) on Vδ2 T cells. Ectopically expressed hMSH2 could trigger a γδ T cell-mediated cytolysis. In this study, we showed that oxidative stress induced ectopic expression of hMSH2 on human renal carcinoma cells. Under oxidative stress, both p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways have been confirmed to mediate the ectopic expression of hMSH2 through the apoptosis-signaling kinase 1 (ASK1) upstream and activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) downstream of both pathways. Moreover, renal carcinoma cell-derived interleukin (IL)-18 in oxidative stress was a prominent stimulator for ectopically induced expression of hMSH2, which was promoted by interferon (IFN)-γ as well. Finally, oxidative stress or pretreatment with IL-18 and IFN-γ enhanced γδ T cell-mediated cytolysis of renal carcinoma cells. Our results not only establish a mechanism of ectopic hMSH2 expression in tumor cells but also find a biological linkage between ectopic expression of hMSH2 and activation of γδ T cells in stressful conditions. Because γδ T cells play an important role in the early stage of innate anti-tumor response, γδ T cell activation triggered by ectopically expressed hMSH2 may be an important event in immunosurveillance for carcinogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2020756257,"Although neuromedin U (NMU) has been implicated in analgesia, the detailed mechanisms still remain unclear. In this study, we identify a novel functional role of NMU type 1 receptor (NMUR1) in regulating the transient outward K+ currents (IA) in small dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. We found that NMU reversibly increased IA in a dose-dependent manner, instead the sustained delayed rectifier K+ current (IDR) was not affected. This NMU-induced IA increase was pertussis toxin-sensitive and was totally reversed by NMUR1 knockdown. Intracellular application of GDPβS (guanosine 5′-O-(2-thiodiphosphate)), QEHA peptide, or a selective antibody raised against the Gαo or Gβ blocked the stimulatory effects of NMU. Pretreatment of the cells with the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor or ERK inhibitor abolished the NMU-induced IA response, whereas inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or PKC had no such effects. Exposure of DRG neurons to NMU markedly induced the phosphorylation of ERK (p-ERK), whereas p-JNK or p-p38 was not affected. Moreover, the NMU-induced p-ERK increase was attenuated by PKA inhibition and activation of PKA by foskolin would mimic the NMU-induced IA increase. Functionally, we observed a significant decrease of the firing rate of neuronal action potential induced by NMU and pretreatment of DRG neurons with 4-AP could abolish this effect. In summary, these results suggested that NMU increases IA via activation of NMUR1 that couples sequentially to the downstream activities of Gβγ of the Go protein, PKA, and ERK, which could contribute to its physiological functions including neuronal hypoexcitability in DRG neurons.

https://openalex.org/W2087261480,"Microorganisms use different pathways for D-galacturonate catabolism. In the known microbial oxidative pathway, D-galacturonate is oxidized to D-galactarolactone, the lactone hydrolyzed to galactarate, which is further converted to 3-deoxy-2-keto-hexarate and α-ketoglutarate. We have shown recently that Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain C58 contains an uronate dehydrogenase (At Udh) that oxidizes D-galacturonic acid to D-galactarolactone. Here we report identification of a novel enzyme from the same A. tumefaciens strain, which we named Galactarolactone cycloisomerase (At Gci) (E.C. 5.5.1.-), for the direct conversion of the D-galactarolactone to 3-deoxy-2-keto-hexarate. The At Gci enzyme is 378 amino acids long and belongs to the mandelate racemase subgroup in the enolase superfamily. At Gci was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified enzyme was found to exist as an octameric form. It is active both on D-galactarolactone and D-glucarolactone, but does not work on the corresponding linear hexaric acid forms. The details of the reaction mechanism were further studied by NMR and optical rotation demonstrating that the reaction product of At Gci from D-galactaro-1,4-lactone and D-glucaro-1,4-lactone conversion is in both cases the L-threo form of 3-deoxy-2-keto-hexarate."
https://openalex.org/W2048024762,"Shwanavidin is an avidin-like protein from the marine proteobactrium Shewanella denitrificans, which exhibits an innate dimeric structure while maintaining high affinity toward biotin. A unique residue (Phe-43) from the L3,4 loop and a distinctive disulfide bridge were shown to account for the high affinity toward biotin. Phe-43 emulates the function and position of the critical intermonomeric Trp that characterizes the tetrameric avidins but is lacking in shwanavidin. The 18 copies of the apo-monomer revealed distinctive snapshots of L3,4 and Phe-43, providing rare insight into loop flexibility, binding site accessibility, and psychrophilic adaptation. Nevertheless, as in all avidins, shwanavidin also displays high thermostability properties. The unique features of shwanavidin may provide a platform for the design of a long sought after monovalent form of avidin, which would be ideal for novel types of biotechnological application."

Here, we describe that RB1 and γ-tubulin proteins moderate each other's expression by binding to their respective gene promoters. Simultaneous reduction of RB1 and γ-tubulin protein levels results in an E2F1-dependent up-regulation of apoptotic genes such as caspase 3. We report that in various tumors types, there is an inverse correlation between the expression levels of γ-tubulin and RB1 and that in tumor cell lines with a nonfunctioning RB1, reduction of γ-tubulin protein levels leads to induction of apoptosis. Thus, the RB1/γ-tubulin signal network can be considered as a new target for cancer treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2090620859,"Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II (COUP-TFII) is an orphan nuclear receptor of the steroid-thyroid hormone receptor superfamily. COUP-TFII is widely expressed in multiple tissues and organs throughout embryonic development and has been shown to regulate cellular growth, differentiation, and organ development. However, the role of COUP-TFII in osteoblast differentiation has not been systematically evaluated. In the present study, COUP-TFII was strongly expressed in multipotential mesenchymal cells, and the endogenous expression level decreased during osteoblast differentiation. Overexpression of COUP-TFII inhibited bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2)-induced osteoblastic gene expression. The results of alkaline phosphatase, Alizarin Red staining, and osteocalcin production assay showed that COUP-TFII overexpression blocks BMP2-induced osteoblast differentiation. In contrast, the down-regulation of COUP-TFII synergistically induced the expression of BMP2-induced osteoblastic genes and osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, the immunoprecipitation assay showed that COUP-TFII and Runx2 physically interacted and COUP-TFII significantly impaired the Runx2-dependent activation of the osteocalcin promoter. From the ChIP assay, we found that COUP-TFII repressed DNA binding of Runx2 to the osteocalcin gene, whereas Runx2 inhibited COUP-TFII expression via direct binding to the COUP-TFII promoter. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that COUP-TFII negatively regulates osteoblast differentiation via interaction with Runx2, and during the differentiation state, BMP2-induced Runx2 represses COUP-TFII expression and promotes osteoblast differentiation."

We describe here the lipid preferences and crystal structure of a new class of PI binding modules exemplified by select IQGAPs (IQ motif containing GTPase-activating proteins) known to coordinate cellular signaling events and cytoskeletal dynamics. This module is defined by a C-terminal 105–107 amino acid region of which IQGAP1 and -2, but not IQGAP3, binds preferentially to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdInsP3). The binding affinity for PtdInsP3, together with other, secondary target-recognition characteristics, are comparable with those of the pleckstrin homology domain of cytohesin-3 (general receptor for phosphoinositides 1), an established PtdInsP3 effector protein.

The biological significance of PI 3-kinase signaling is emphasized by the diverse disease conditions associated with the dysregulation of these primary events and those further downstream in this pathway (10Marone R.

The cellular effects of 3-phosphoinositides are mediated by the ability of these lipids to modify the localization and/or activity of an array of effector proteins with appropriate recognition domains selective for one or, possibly more 3-PI signals (12Lemmon M.A. Phosphoinositide recognition domains.Traffic. 2003; 4: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 13Narayan K.

Among the wider set of established protein modules several, including pleckstrin homology (PH), phox homology (PX), and FYVE domains in particular, represent important 3-PI binding units and their recognition and characterization has greatly facilitated the understanding of PI 3-kinase signaling (12Lemmon M.A. Phosphoinositide recognition domains.Traffic. 2003; 4: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 14Lemmon M.A. Membrane recognition by phospholipid-binding domains.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2008; 9: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). However, numerous proteins, including many of the enzymes involved in the maintenance of cellular phosphoinositide and inositol phosphate concentrations, lack such domains but nevertheless, recognize their cognate phosphoinositol targets with a degree of selectivity and affinity tuned appropriately to their biological functions. This suggests that additional protein modules capable of selective 3-PI binding but distinct from those already established may yet await recognition. On this premise, we recently described a proteomic screen for novel 3-PI effector proteins that, in addition to numerous other candidates, identified IQGAP1 as a potential PtdInsP3-responsive protein (15Dixon M.J.

Thus, the potential, direct interaction between IQGAP1 and 3-PIs offers the opportunity not only to establish new functional connections to the wider PI 3-kinase signaling network but also, perhaps, to identify novel 3-PI protein recognition domains. Here we show that a module at the extreme C terminus of select IQGAP family members accounts for the binding of IQGAP1 to 3-PIs. A combination of in vitro and cellular approaches demonstrates that this domain from IQGAP1 and -2 but not IQGAP3, binds selectively to PtdInsP3 with an affinity and other lipid binding characteristics comparable with those displayed by the PH domain of GRP1 (general receptor for phosphoinositides or cytohesin-3), an established PtdInsP3 effector protein. By solving the crystal structure of the IQGAP2 C-terminal domain, we demonstrate that this domain represents a protein module distinct from those currently recognized to bind phosphoinositides but with features reminiscent of some C2 domains. These results thus suggest that this novel, atypical phosphoinositide (aPI) binding domain may serve to integrate PI 3-kinase signaling with the activity of select IQGAP family members. Most pertinently, the identification of this aPI binding unit raises the exciting prospect that it may reflect the first of a wider set of such protein modules, not all necessarily similar but collectively identifiable by their distinction from the existing, canonical groups of PI binding domains.

Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum and an additional 2 mm glutamine. The C-terminal region of IQGAP1 (GST-IQGAP1(718–1657)) was cloned as described previously (15Dixon M.J. Gray A. Boisvert F.M. Agacan M. Morrice N.A. Gourlay R. Leslie N.R. Downes C.P. Batty I.H.

The cDNA of GST-IQGAP1(718–1657) was used as a template for PCR amplification of the aPI binding domain from IQGAP1 (amino acids 1551–1657) using the following primers: sense, 5′-TCAACGGATCCAAGCTTATGAAAGGAAAGAAAAGC-3′ and antisense, 5′-CGAAGCGGCCGCAGATCTTTACTTCCCGTAGAAC-3′. The resulting PCR product was subcloned into pGEX-6P-1 following BamHI/NotI digestion. The cDNAs encoding the aPI domains from IQGAP2 and IQGAP3 (amino acids 1470–1575 and 1527–1631, respectively) were obtained by minigene synthesis and purchased from Dundee Cell Products (Dundee, UK). An enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) construct for aPIIQGAP1 was generated by subcloning from the aPIIQGAP1-GST vector (BglII/SmaI-EGFPC1 and BamHI/BsaAI-aPIIQGAP1-GST). The sequence of all constructs was confirmed by The Sequencing Service, University of Dundee. For crystallography, an N-terminal His-tagged construct of IQGAP2 residues 1476–1571 was incorporated into pET28-mhl (GI: 134105571). Cells were seeded at 15,000/cm2 onto pre-sterilized coverslips in 6-well plates in 1.5 ml of appropriate culture medium. After 16 h, the cells were transfected with 1 μg of cDNA encoding the EGFP constructs indicated using FuGENE (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following the expression of proteins over 24 h, the cells were serum starved for 2 h, then further incubated as indicated, washed twice with 1.5 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mm KH2PO4, 2.7 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl), and fixed with 1.5 ml of 2% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 10 min. The fixed cells were washed twice with 1.5 ml of PBS and once with 1.5 ml of Tris-buffered saline (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), then incubated at room temperature for 5 min in 1.5 ml of TBS supplemented with 0.1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. The fixed cells were then stained with DAPI (4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, 1 μg/ml) in 1.5 ml of TBS for 15 min. Following a final wash with 1.5 ml of TBS, the coverslips were mounted with Mowiol 4-88 (Calbiochem) and 2.5% (w/v) diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) and the cells were imaged using a DeltaVision Spectris microscope. The pGEX-6P-1 constructs encoding GST-aPI domains were transformed into BL21 Escherichia coli and cultures were grown for 16 h at 37 °C in 50 ml of Luria Bertani (LB) broth supplemented with 100 μm ampicillin. The cultures were then diluted into 500 ml of LB supplemented similarly and subsequently allowed to reach an A600 of ∼0.6 before being incubated further at 18 °C for 16 h following the addition of isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (50 μm). The bacterial cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 6000 × g and 4 °C for 30 min then re-suspended in 25 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10 mm glycerol 2-phosphate, 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, supplemented with fresh 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm benzamidine, and 1 mm sodium vanadate) prior to a single round of freeze-thawing and sonication. Following a second round of similar centrifugations, the supernatants were loaded onto columns (1–3 ml) of glutathione-Sepharose pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer at 4 °C. The columns were washed with 10–30 ml of buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.2) supplemented with an additional 350 mm NaCl and then with 10–30 ml of buffer alone. The proteins were eluted with 5–15 ml of buffer supplemented 15 mm glutathione and the eluate was dialyzed against 5 liters of buffer supplemented with 1 mm dithiothreitol and 20% (v/v) glycerol at 4 °C for 12 h. Aliquots (100 μl) of the proteins were frozen in a dry ice/methanol bath and stored at −80 °C prior to analysis. The His-tagged C-terminal fragment of IQGAP2 was expressed in a BL21 E. coli strain harboring the pRARE2 plasmid by inoculating 100 ml of overnight culture grown in LB broth into 2 liters of Terrific Broth medium in the presence of 50 μg/ml of kanamycin and 25 μg/ml of chloramphenicol at 37 °C. When the A600 reached ∼3.0, the temperature of the medium was lowered to 15 °C and the culture was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside. The cells were allowed to grow overnight then harvested, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80 °C. The frozen cells from 2 liters of TB culture were thawed and re-suspended in 150 ml of extraction buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 5 mm imidazole) supplemented with fresh 0.5% (v/v) CHAPS, protease inhibitor mixture, and 3 μl of benzonase (250units/μl), then lysed using a micro-fluidizer at 15,000 p.s.i. The lysate was centrifuged at 22,500 × g for 45 min and the supernatants were mixed with 5 ml of a 50% (w/v) slurry of Talon beads, then incubated at 4 °C on a rotary shaker for 1 h. The mixture was then centrifuged at 850 × g for 5 min and the supernatant was discarded. The beads were then washed successively with buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) containing 30 and 75 mm imidazole, and finally eluted with the same buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. The eluate was collected and further purified on a Superdex-75 gel filtration column pre-equilibrated with 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, and 1 mm tris(2-carboxymethyl)phosphine.

Briefly, SPR was performed using a Biacore 3000 biosensor (GE Healthcare) and streptavidin sensor chips were coated with biotinylated lipids presented in a four flow-cell format that allowed measurement at 25 °C of protein binding to a reference surface (no lipid) to be compared simultaneously with that to test surfaces loaded with PtdIns(3,4)P2, PtdIns(4,5)P2, or PtdInsP3. To increase the sensitivity and prolong the lifespan of the streptavidin chips, these were primed, prior to lipid loading, with three 60-s pulses of 5 mm NaOH delivered at a flow rate of 5 μl/min with three running buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 250 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA) washes at the same flow rate between consecutive priming cycles. The lipids (100 μm), diluted in running buffer, were loaded at a flow rate of 5 μl/min for 1 min or to achieve a comparable loading of each lipid corresponding to ∼200–250 response units. This is equivalent to a lipid mass of ∼200–300 fmol or a flow cell concentration of ∼10 μm, assuming the estimate from the manufacturer that 1 response unit corresponds to 1 pg/mm2 of bound analyte. However, the tetravalent capacity of streptavidin together with the potential steric hindrance associated with densely tethered ligands may reduce the effective mass of immobilized lipid.

https://openalex.org/W2147035936,"FOXC1 and FOXC2 are forkhead transcription factors that play essential roles during development and physiology. Despite their critical role, the mechanisms that regulate the function of these factors remain poorly understood. We have identified conserved motifs within a previously defined N-terminal negative regulatory region of FOXC1/C2 that conforms to the definition of synergy control or SC motifs. Because such motifs inhibit the activity of transcription factors by serving as sites of post-translational modification by small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO), we have examined whether FOXC1/C2 are targets of SUMOylation and probed the functional significance of this modification. We find that endogenous FOXC1 forms modified by SUMO2/3 can be detected. Moreover, in cell culture, all three SUMO isoforms are readily conjugated to FOXC1 and FOXC2. The modification can be reconstituted in vitro with purified components and can be reversed in vitro by treatment with the SUMO protease SENP2. SUMOylation of FOXC1 and FOXC2 occurs primarily on one consensus synergy control motif with minor contributions of a second, more degenerate site. Notably, although FOXC1 is also phosphorylated at multiple sites, disruption of sites immediately downstream of the SC motifs does not influence SUMOylation. Consistent with a negative functional role, SUMOylation-deficient mutants displayed higher transcriptional activity when compared with wild type forms despite comparable protein levels and subcellular localization. Thus, the findings demonstrate that SC motifs mediate the inhibitory function of this region by serving as sites for SUMOylation and reveal a novel mechanism for acute and reversible regulation of FOXC1/C2 function.

Forkhead box C1 (FOXC1) 3The abbreviations used are: FOXC1/FOXC2forkhead box C1/C2SUMOsmall ubiquitin-like modifierSENPsentrin-specific proteaseSCsynergy controlRIPAradioimmunoprecipitation assay. is a member of a large superfamily of transcription factors composed of ∼90 members with orthologs expressed in species ranging from yeast to humans. Members of this superfamily contain an evolutionary conserved 110-amino acid DNA-binding domain known as the forkhead domain (1.Kaestner K.H. Knochel W. Martinez D.E. Unified nomenclature for the winged helix/forkhead transcription factors.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 142-146Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and are central to multiple developmental and pathological processes including the maintenance of differentiated cell states, tissue-specific gene expression, embryogenesis, and tumorigenesis (2.Carlsson P. Mahlapuu M. Forkhead transcription factors: key players in development and metabolism.Dev. Biol. 2002; 250: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar). FOXC1 is highly homologous to FOXC2, which was previously referred to as Mfh1 (3.Hiemisch H. Schütz G. Kaestner K.H.

Mutations in the FOXC1 gene in humans are associated with Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome, a disorder characterized by multiple morphological and functional defects including significant eye abnormalities, predisposition to glaucoma development, craniofacial dysmorphism, and dental anomalies (4.Tümer Z.

Remarkably, despite ample evidence of their functional importance, the mechanisms that regulate the function of these important factors remain poorly understood. Post-translational modifications are a widespread mechanism to regulate the activity of sequence-specific transcription factors. Both SUMOylation and phosphorylation are powerful modifications that can regulate the function of a protein by changing its intrinsic activity, subcellular localization, or stability as a consequence of alterations in protein-protein or protein-nucleic acid interactions. The mammalian small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) family consists of four genes designated SUMO1–4. SUMO2 and -3 are closely related, whereas SUMO1 shares only 48% identity with either SUMO2 or SUMO3 (11.Saitoh H. Hinchey J. Functional heterogeneity of small ubiquitin-related protein modifiers SUMO-1 versus SUMO-2/3.J. Biol.

The SUMO pathway: emerging mechanisms that shape specificity, conjugation, and recognition.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2010; 11: 861-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (846) Google Scholar). SUMO4 shares 86% amino acid homology with SUMO2/3 (14.Bohren K.M. Nadkarni V. Song J.H. Gabbay K.H. Owerbach D. An M55V polymorphism in a novel SUMO gene (SUMO-4) differentially activates heat shock transcription factors and is associated with susceptibility to type I diabetes mellitus.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27233-27238Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar); whether this form is actually conjugated to target proteins, however, is unclear (15.Owerbach D. McKay E.M. Yeh E.T. Gabbay K.H. Bohren K.M. A proline 90 residue unique to SUMO-4 prevents maturation and sumoylation.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 337: 517-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Following an initial C-terminal proteolytic processing by SUMO-specific proteases, SUMO is activated in an ATP-dependent manner by the heterodimeric E1-activating enzyme SAE1/SAE2 (16.Olsen S.K. Capili A.D. Lu X. Tan D.S. Lima C.D. Active site remodeling accompanies thioester bond formation in the SUMO E1.Nature. 2010; 463: 906-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). SUMO is then transferred to the SUMO-specific E2-conjugating enzyme Ubc9, which catalyzes the formation of an isopeptide bond between the C terminus of SUMO and the amino group of the target lysine (17.Johnson E.S. Blobel G. Ubc9p is the conjugating enzyme for the ubiquitin-like protein Smt3p.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26799-26802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 18.Bernier-Villamor V. Sampson D.A. Matunis M.J. Lima C.D.

This step can be enhanced by proteins with SUMO-specific E3 activity such as members of the protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS) family of proteins (19.Palvimo J.J. PIAS proteins as regulators of small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) modifications and transcription.Biochem. Soc Trans. 2007; 35: 1405-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). SUMOylation is a reversible process, and mammalian SENP family members are responsible for cleaving the SUMO moiety (20.Yeh E.T. SUMOylation and de-SUMOylation: wrestling with life's processes.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 8223-8227Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). SUMOylation is now established as an important modification that negatively regulates sequence-specific transcription factors (21.Iñiguez-Lluhí J.A. Control of Transcription by SUMO modification.in: Wilson V.G. SUMO Regulation of Cellular Processes. Springer-Verlag New York Inc., New York2009: 13-40Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). This prominent function was revealed in part by the convergence between the functional definition of synergy control or SC motifs (22.Iñiguez-Lluhí J.A. Pearce D. A common motif within the negative regulatory regions of multiple factors inhibits their transcriptional synergy.Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 6040-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and the consensus for SUMO modification and by the demonstration that SC motifs exert their effects by serving as sites of SUMOylation (23.Poukka H. Karvonen U. Janne O.A. Palvimo J.J. Covalent modification of the androgen receptor by small ubiquitin-like modifier 1 (SUMO-1).Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 15758-15763Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Functionally, SC motifs are short autonomous sequences that limit the transcriptional activity of regulators in a promoter context-dependent manner (22.Iñiguez-Lluhí J.A. Pearce D. A common motif within the negative regulatory regions of multiple factors inhibits their transcriptional synergy.Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 6040-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) with the strongest inhibition observed at DNA sequences where regulators bind most stably (26.Holmstrom S.R. Chupreta S. So A.Y. Iñiguez-Lluhí J.A. SUMO-mediated inhibition of glucocorticoid receptor synergistic activity depends on stable assembly at the promoter but not on DAXX.Mol. Endocrinol. 2008; 22: 2061-2075Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Notably, deletion analysis studies have indicated the presence of a functional negative regulatory domain in the central region of FOXC1 (27.Berry F.B. Saleem R.A. Walter M.A. FOXC1 transcriptional regulation is mediated by N- and C-terminal activation domains and contains a phosphorylated transcriptional inhibitory domain.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10292-10297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and FOXC2 (28.Fujita H. Kang M. Eren M. Gleaves L.A. Vaughan D.E. Kume T. Foxc2 is a common mediator of insulin and transforming growth factor β signaling to regulate plasminogen activator inhibitor type I gene expression.Circ. Res. 2006; 98: 626-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), but any mechanistic link to specific post-translational modifications has not been defined. In this study, we have identified conserved motifs within these negative regulatory regions that conform to the definition of synergy control motifs. We have therefore examined whether FOXC1/C2 are targets of SUMOylation and probed the role of this post-translational modification with regard to the mechanism of action of these negative regulatory regions as well as its relation to phosphorylation. Human embryonic kidney (HEK 293T) and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) and 50 IU/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were transfected using 25-kDa linear polyethyleneimine (PEI; Polysciences, Warrington, PA) as described previously (29.Danciu T.E. Whitman M. Oxidative stress drives disulfide bond formation between basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors.J. Cell Biochem. 2010; 109: 417-424PubMed Google Scholar). The N-terminal, 3×FLAG, or 6×RGS-histidine-tagged mouse FOXC1 and FOXC2 expression plasmids were generated by PCR amplification of FOXC1 (ATCC IMAGE clone: 5720391) and FOXC2 (plasmid kindly provided by Dr. T. Kume, University of Chicago) cDNA sequences using primers containing EcoRI/XhoI sites and ligation into pcs4-3×FLAG or pcs4-6×RGS-His. Single and double point mutants within the putative SC motifs of FOXC1 and FOXC2 as well as all phosphorylation site mutations were generated by one-step site-directed PCR-based mutagenesis as described previously (30.Makarova O. Kamberov E. Margolis B. Generation of deletion and point mutations with one primer in a single cloning step.BioTechniques. 2000; 29: 970-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Deletion of the FOXC1 inhibitory domain was also accomplished by one-step site-directed PCR based mutagenesis using the following primer to delete amino acids 221–324 of mouse FOXC1: 5′-CCCGGGCCACAGCCGCCGGCCGCTGAGCTCGGTTCC-3′.

The binding sites were then duplicated by ligation of independent SalI/KpnI and XhoI/KpnI fragments of pΔ3×BSDLO yielding plasmid pΔ6×BSDLO. Lentivirus overexpression vectors were generated by subcloning 3×FLAG-FOXC2 and the SUMOylation site mutant from the corresponding pcs4-3×FLAG vectors into pLentilox-IRES-Puro vector. This vector and the companion vectors for lentivirus production, psPAX2 and pVSV-G, were obtained from the University of Michigan Vector Core (Ann Arbor, MI). For lentivirus generation, HEK 293T cells (8 × 105/well) seeded in 6-well dishes were transfected 24 h later with 0.8 μg of lentivirus vectors and 1.6 μg of packaging vectors (0.8 μg each of VSV-G and psPAX2) using PEI. The media were changed and supplemented with 10 mm sodium butyrate (Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, MA) 24 h after transfection. Supernatants containing mature lentivirus were harvested 48 h after transfection and filtered using 0.45-μm PVDF syringe filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Fertilized Xenopus embryos were obtained and maintained as described previously (33.Watanabe M. Whitman M. FAST-1 is a key maternal effector of mesoderm inducers in the early Xenopus embryo.Development. 1999; 126: 5621-5634Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Embryos were staged according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (34.Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J.

Embryos injected at the two-cell stage with 500 pg of HA-FOXC1 mRNA were lysed at stage 10.5 in modified RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris (pH 8), 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate,1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40) supplemented with 2× Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-HA antibodies. Immunoprecipitates were incubated in the presence or absence of λ-protein phosphatase (New England Biolabs). Eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting with an anti-HA antibody or stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Bands corresponding to FOXC1 were excised from the stained gel and submitted for analysis to the Taplin Biological Mass Spectrometry Facility (Department of Cell Biology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). HeLa cells seeded in 24-well dishes (2.4 × 105/well) were transfected using PEI (Polysciences) (29.Danciu T.E. Whitman M.

Cells received 10 ng of pGL3-6×BS, 60 ng of FLAG-tagged FOXC1 or control expression vector, and 120 ng of pCMV-β-gal per well. FOXC2 assays were similar except for the use of 60 ng of pΔODLO 6×BS-Luc as reporter and 100 ng of FLAG-tagged FOXC2 expression vector. Cells were lysed 24 h after transfection, and luciferase and β-galactosidase activities were determined as described previously (35.Chupreta S. Brevig H. Bai L. Merchant J.L. Iñiguez-Lluhí J.A.

To assess FOXC expression, parallel cultures were lysed in modified RIPA buffer supplemented with 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Sigma). Lysates were centrifuged, and supernatants were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting as described below. For endogenous gene analysis, 1 ml of lentiviral supernatant and 1 ml of fresh 3T3-L1 medium (DMEM 11995, Invitrogen; 10% calf bovine serum, Denville Scientific) was added to 3T3-L1 cells cultured in 6-well dishes for 24 h in the presence of 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Millipore). The cells were then rinsed thoroughly with PBS and cultured in fresh medium for another 24 h prior to puromycin (Acros Organics, Thermo Fisher Scientific) selection (4 μg/ml) for 2 weeks. RNA was isolated and purified using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA). Oligo(dT) (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) primed cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of RNA, using Multiscribe reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative real-time PCR reactions were carried out in triplicate in a Roche Applied Science 480 LightCycler using QuantiTect SYBR Green reagents (Qiagen) and primers for mouse genes Rpl19 (forward, 5′-TGTACCTGAAGGTCAAAGGGAATGTG-3′; reverse 5′-TTCTTGGTCTCCTCCTCCTTGGAC-3′) and Hey1 (forward, 5′-TACCCAGTGCCTTTGAGAAG-3′; reverse 5′-TCCGATAGTCCATAGCCAGG-3′). The software LinRegPCR (version 11.0) was used to estimate mRNA levels of Hey1 relative to levels of Rpl19. For endogenous protein SUMOylation, cultured cells were collected in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then lysed in modified RIPA buffer supplemented with 10 μl/ml protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Lysates (1 mg) were precleared by incubating 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking after the addition of 30 μl of protein A/G plus agarose beads (50% slurry, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Precleared lysates were then incubated with gentle rocking overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg/ml FOXC1 antibody (Bethyl Laboratories, Montgomery, TX) or 5 μg/ml normal rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG; Santa Cruz Biotechnology; 500 μg per condition). Samples were then incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking with 50 μl of protein A/G plus agarose beads. Immunoprecipitates were further washed in SENP buffer (25 mm Tris HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, and 2 mm DTT) and incubated at 23 °C for 30 min at 50% slurry with 1 nm purified catalytic domain of WT SENP2 or the catalytically inactive C548S mutant (36.Reverter D.

In parallel, 15 μg of lysate (before immunoprecipitation) was also treated with WT or C548S SENP2 in SENP buffer. Reactions were terminated by the addition of Laemmli sample buffer. Samples were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and processed for immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. For SUMOylation experiments in cultured cells, HEK 293T cells (1.5 × 106/well) were seeded onto 6-well dishes and transfected with 0.25 μg of FLAG FOXC1 or FLAG FOXC2 and 0.5 μg of the indicated HA-SUMO expression vector using PEI (29.Danciu T.E. Whitman M. Oxidative stress drives disulfide bond formation between basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors.J. Cell Biochem. 2010; 109: 417-424PubMed Google Scholar). When necessary, transfections included an amount of the corresponding empty vector as to maintain an equimolar amount of each vector per well. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection in modified RIPA buffer supplemented with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and 5 mm N-ethylmaleimide. FLAG immunoprecipitation was performed for 3h at 4 °C using an anti-FLAG affinity agarose (Sigma-Aldrich). Beads were washed four times in modified RIPA buffer and once in PBS. Samples were eluted in Laemmli sample buffer, resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE, and processed for immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. For samples subjected to SUMO deconjugation, immunoprecipitates were further washed in SENP buffer and treated as indicated above before elution in Laemmli sample buffer. For in vitro SUMOylation reactions, HEK 293T cells were transfected as above with 0.5 μg of FOXC1, FOXC2, or empty vector per well.

Reactions were initiated by the addition of an ATP regeneration system (final concentrations: 10 units/ml creatine kinase, 25 mm phosphocreatine, 5 mm ATP, and 0.6 units/ml pyrophosphatase). Samples were incubated for 30 °C for 90 min, and reactions were terminated by the addition of 20 μl of disruption buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1.67% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.24 m β-mercaptoethanol, 0.015% bromphenol blue) and boiling for 5 min. Samples were resolved by 7.5% SDS-PAGE and processed for immunoblotting as described below.

For all figures, images shown are representative of at least three independent experiments. For immunofluorescence, HEK 293T cells transfected with FLAG-tagged FOXC1 and FOXC2 constructs were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS, permeabilized with Triton X-100 (0.05%) in PBS, and incubated with monoclonal anti-FLAG M2-FITC antibody (Sigma), at 10 μg/ml in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 1 h. Actin staining was then carried out by incubating cells for 30 min in Alexa Fluor 555 phalloidin at a 1:100 dilution (Invitrogen). DNA counterstain was obtained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) included in the VECTASHIELD HardSet mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).

ESCRT-0 is formed by two subunits known as Hrs (hepatocyte growth factor-regulated substrate) and STAM (signal transducing adaptor molecule), both of which harbor multiple ubiquitin-binding domains (UBDs). In particular, STAM2 possesses two UBDs, the VHS (Vps27/Hrs/Stam) and UIM (ubiquitin interacting motif) domains, connected by a 20-amino acid flexible linker. In the present study, we report the interactions of the UIM domain and VHS-UIM construct of STAM2 with monoubiquitin (Ub), Lys48- and Lys63-linked diubiquitins. Our results demonstrate that the UIM domain alone binds monoubiquitin, Lys48- and Lys63-linked diubiquitins with the same affinity and in the same binding mode. Interestingly, binding of VHS-UIM to Lys63-linked diubiquitin is not only avid, but also cooperative. We also show that the distal domain of Lys63-linked diubiquitin stabilizes the helical structure of the UIM domain and that the corresponding complex adopts a specific structural organization responsible for its greater affinity. In contrast, binding of VHS-UIM to Lys48-linked diubiquitin and monoubiquitin is not cooperative and does not show any avidity. These results may explain the better sorting efficiency of some cargoes polyubiquitinated with Lys63-linked chains over monoubiquitinated cargoes or those tagged with Lys48-linked chains.

https://openalex.org/W2078801247,"The B-cell translocation gene 2, BTG2, a member of the BTG/TOB (B-cell translocation gene/transducers of ErbB2) gene family, has been implicated in cell cycle regulation, normal development, and possibly tumor suppression. Previously, it was shown that BTG2 expression is lost or down-regulated in human breast cancers. We now report that BTG2 protects human mammary epithelial cells from oxidative stress due to hydrogen peroxide and other oxidants. BTG2 protection against oxidative stress is BRCA1-independent but requires the antioxidant transcription factor NFE2L2 and is associated with up-regulation of the expression of antioxidant enzymes, including catalase and superoxide dismutases 1 and 2. BTG2 stimulation of antioxidant gene expression is also NFE2L2-dependent. We further demonstrate that BTG2 is a binding partner for NFE2L2 and increases its transcriptional activity. In addition, BTG2 is detectable at the antioxidant response element (ARE) of several NFE2L2-responsive genes. Finally, we show that the ability of BTG2 to associate with NFE2L2, to protect cells against oxidative stress, and to stimulate antioxidant gene expression requires box B, a short highly conserved amino acid motif characteristic of BTG2/TOB family proteins, but does not require boxes A or C. These findings suggest a novel role for BTG2 as a co-activator for NFE2L2 in up-regulating cellular antioxidant defenses."
https://openalex.org/W1996463765,"Transporters of the major excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate play a crucial role in glutamatergic neurotransmission by removing their substrate from the synaptic cleft. The transport mechanism involves co-transport of glutamic acid with three Na+ ions followed by countertransport of one K+ ion. Structural work on the archeal homologue GltPh indicates a role of a conserved asparagine in substrate binding. According to a recent proposal, this residue may also participate in a novel Na+ binding site. In this study, we characterize mutants of this residue from the neuronal transporter EAAC1, Asn-451. None of the mutants, except for N451S, were able to exhibit transport. However, the Km of this mutant for l-aspartate was increased ∼30-fold. Remarkably, the increase for d-aspartate and l-glutamate was 250- and 400-fold, respectively. Moreover, the cation specificity of N451S was altered because sodium but not lithium could support transport. A similar change in cation specificity was observed with a mutant of a conserved threonine residue, T370S, also implicated to participate in the novel Na+ site together with the bound substrate. In further contrast to the wild type transporter, only l-aspartate was able to activate the uncoupled anion conductance by N451S, but with an almost 1000-fold reduction in apparent affinity.

Chem. 2006; 281: 27905-27915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Based on computational studies, the Na3 site was proposed to be formed by the side-chains of conserved threonine and asparagine residues, from TMs 7 and 8, respectively as well as by carboxyl oxygens of the acidic amino acid substrate (35.Larsson H.P. Wang X. Lev B. Baconguis I. Caplan D.A. Vyleta N.P. Koch H.P. Diez-Sampedro A. Noskov S.Y. Evidence for a third sodium-binding site in glutamate transporters suggests an ion/substrate coupling model.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 13912-13917Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). This proposal is attractive because it could explain the observation that the apparent affinity for different transported acidic amino acids depends on the nature of the cotransported cation (37.Menaker D. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. The substrate specificity of a neuronal glutamate transporter is determined by the nature of the coupling ion.J. Neurochem. 2006; 99: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). However, although the analyzed mutants of the conserved asparagine (Asn-451 in the neuronal transporter EAAC1) could bind Na+, they were transport-deficient (35.Larsson H.P. Wang X. Lev B. Baconguis I. Caplan D.A. Vyleta N.P. Koch H.P. Diez-Sampedro A. Noskov S.Y. Evidence for a third sodium-binding site in glutamate transporters suggests an ion/substrate coupling model.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 13912-13917Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Thus, a possible role of the substrate in cation coordination at the Na3 site could not be probed. Here we report on an Asn-451 mutant, N451S, with significant transport activity. This transport has an altered selectivity not only for the cation but also for the substrate. Our data provide experimental support for the involvement of the substrate in the predicted Na3 site, providing an important clue for the coupling between cation and substrate fluxes. Moreover, the new data suggest a distinct orientation of the substrate in the binding pocket during the activation of the anion conductance. The C-terminal histidine-tagged versions of rabbit EAAC1 (EAAC1-WT) (38.Kanai Y. Hediger M.A. Primary structure and functional characterization of a high-affinity glutamate transporter.Nature. 1992; 360: 467-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar, 39.Borre L. Kanner B.I.

Rapid and efficient site-specific mutagenesis without phenotypic selection.Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4558) Google Scholar). This was followed by subcloning of the mutations into His-tagged EAAC1, residing in the oocyte expression vector pOG2 (39.Borre L. Kanner B.I. Arginine 445 controls the coupling between glutamate and cations in the neuronal transporter EAAC-1.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2513-2519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), using the unique restriction enzymes NsiI and StuI. The subcloned DNA fragments were sequenced between these unique restriction sites. For expression of wild type and mutant transporters, their cDNA constructs residing in the oocyte expression vector were linearized with SacI. Capped run-off cRNA transcripts were made from the transporter constructs using mMESSAGE-mMACHINE (Ambion). The transporter constructs were either EAAC1-WT (39.Borre L. Kanner B.I.

Chem. 2004; 279: 2513-2519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) or the indicated mutants. The cRNAs were injected into Xenopus laevis oocytes, which were prepared as described (25.Borre L. Kanner B.I. Coupled, but not uncoupled, fluxes in a neuronal glutamate transporter can be activated by lithium ions.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and transporter currents were measured 2–3 days post-injection, as described in the next paragraph. Oocytes were placed in the recording chamber, penetrated with two agarose-cushioned micropipettes (1%/2 m KCl, resistance varied between 1 and 3 megaohms), voltage clamped using GeneClamp 500 (Axon Instruments) and digitized using Digidata 1322 (Axon Instruments both controlled by the pClamp9.0 suite (Axon Instruments). Voltage jumping was performed using a conventional two-electrode voltage clamp as described previously (25.Borre L. Kanner B.I. Coupled, but not uncoupled, fluxes in a neuronal glutamate transporter can be activated by lithium ions.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The standard buffer, termed ND96, was composed of 96 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Na-HEPES, pH 7.5. In sodium titration experiments, NaCl was replaced by equimolar concentrations of choline Cl. The composition of other perfusion solutions is indicated in the Fig. legends. Offset voltages in chloride substitution experiments were avoided by use of an agarose bridge (1%/2 m KCl) that connected the recording chamber to the Ag/AgCl ground electrode. All current-voltage relations represent steady-state substrate- elicited net currents ((Ibuffer+substrate) − (Ibuffer)) and were analyzed by Clampfit (version 8.2 or 9.0, Axon instruments). Because of the variability in expression level within and between different oocyte batches, the data have been normalized as indicated in the figure legends. Kinetic parameters were determined by non-linear fitting to the generalized Hill equation using the built-in functions of Origin (version 6.1, Microcal). For determination of apparent affinity for substrate, the current observed at saturating substrate concentrations (Imax) and K0.5 were allowed to vary and the value of nH was fixed at 1. Because of the voltage dependence of Imax, we defined the kinetic parameters at −100 mV, except for Fig. 7, where the parameters were determined at +40 mV. To evaluate expression of the mutant transporters, biotinylation was done as described previously (36.Rosental N. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. Multiple consequences of mutating two conserved β-bridge forming residues in the translocation cycle of a neuronal glutamate transporter.J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27905-27915Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Briefly, five oocytes expressing wild type or mutant EAAC1, were treated with 1.5 mg/ml of sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamide)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (Pierce) dissolved in ND96. After solubilization of the membrane proteins with Triton X-100 and treatment with streptavidin beads, the biotinylated proteins were eluted with a final volume of 70 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer and analyzed by Western blotting. The blots were probed with an affinity purified antibody directed against rabbit EAAT3 (generously provided by N. C. Danbolt, University of Oslo; anti-C491 (Ab,371 (42.Holmseth S. Dehnes Y. Bjørnsen L.P. Boulland J.L. Furness D.N. Bergles D. Danbolt N.C. Specificity of antibodies: Unexpected cross-reactivity of antibodies directed against the excitatory amino acid transporter 3 (EAAT3).Neuroscience. 2005; 136: 649-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar)). To test the role of the conserved asparagine residue, located at position 451 in EAAC1 in the transport mechanism, we measured the l-aspartate-induced transport currents in oocytes expressing the Asn-451 mutants in the presence of 96 mm Na+. No measurable currents were seen with the alanine, cysteine, aspartate, and glutamine replacement mutants, even when l-aspartate was applied at 20 mm, a super-saturating concentration (Fig. 1A). However, at this concentration, the N451S mutant exhibited currents of a magnitude of ∼60% of those by EAAC1-WT (Fig. 1A). These currents were not observed in the absence of sodium (replacement by choline; data not shown). The loss of activity of the N451A/N451C/N451D/N451Q mutants is not due to decreased steady-state levels of the mutant transporters on the plasma membrane because the intensity of the bands in the biotinylated fraction of these mutants is similar to that of EAAC1-WT or N451S, as shown by surface biotinylation (Fig. 1B). Because the GltPh counterpart of Asn-451, Asn-401, directly coordinates the α-carboxylate group of l-aspartate (23.Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Coupling substrate and ion binding to extracellular gate of a sodium-dependent aspartate transporter.Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar), the voltage dependence of the currents induced by 20 mm of each of the substrates l-aspartate, d-aspartate, and l-glutamate was determined. In contrast to EAAC1-WT, where similar currents were elicited by each of these substrates (Fig. 2A), in the N451S mutant, larger currents were elicited by l-aspartate than by the two other substrates at all voltages (Fig. 2B). The substrate specificity of these measurements is illustrated by the fact that no currents were induced by GABA, which is not a substrate for the glutamate transporters (Fig. 2B). The apparent substrate affinity of N451S for l-glutamate and d-aspartate was reduced much more dramatically than for l-aspartate (Fig. 3). The Km values for the former two substrates were 3900 ± 424 and 2580 ± 82 μm, respectively, as compared with l-aspartate with a Km of 308 ± 49 μm (n = 3) (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, also in the case of l-aspartate, there was a severe drop in apparent affinity because Km values of ∼10 μm for each of the three substrates were found for EAAC1-WT (37.Menaker D. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. The substrate specificity of a neuronal glutamate transporter is determined by the nature of the coupling ion.J. Neurochem. 2006; 99: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because of the high substrate concentration used in the experiments depicted in Fig. 2, each of the three substrates was saturating. The GltPh counterpart of Thr-370, Thr-314, directly coordinates the β-carboxylate group of l-aspartate, rather than the α-carboxylate group coordinated by GltPh-N401 (23.Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Coupling substrate and ion binding to extracellular gate of a sodium-dependent aspartate transporter.Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The only substitution mutant at position 370, which retains transport currents, is T370S (25.Borre L. Kanner B.I. Coupled, but not uncoupled, fluxes in a neuronal glutamate transporter can be activated by lithium ions.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The currents induced by 5 mm of l-aspartate were also larger than those by l-glutamate or by d-aspartate (Fig. 2C). In lithium-containing medium, significant l-aspartate-induced currents were observed by EAAC1-WT, albeit of smaller magnitude than in sodium (Fig. 4A). Also, l-glutamate and d-aspartate induced significant currents in oocytes expressing EAAC1-WT in lithium-containing media (Fig. 4A). We reported that the T370S mutant has an altered cation selectivity of radioactive transport and of the transport currents induced by l-aspartate (25.Borre L. Kanner B.I. Coupled, but not uncoupled, fluxes in a neuronal glutamate transporter can be activated by lithium ions.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). In contrast to EAAC1-WT, these activities were not seen with the mutant in lithium (25.Borre L. Kanner B.I. Coupled, but not uncoupled, fluxes in a neuronal glutamate transporter can be activated by lithium ions.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). As can be seen in Fig. 4B, not only l-aspartate, but also d-aspartate and l-glutamate, were incapable of inducing any currents in the presence of lithium. Also in the case of the N451S mutant, none of the substrates induced any currents in the presence of this cation (Fig. 4C). To examine whether the mutation has changed the affinity of the transporter for sodium in addition to the change in selectivity, we measured the sodium concentration dependence of currents induced by 20 mm of each of the substrates at −100 mV (Fig. 5). For EAAC1-WT, the concentration of sodium to obtain half-maximal activation of the currents was similar for all the substrates (22.8 ± 2.4, 26.8 ± 3.3, and 23.7 ± 2.6 mm for l-aspartate, l-glutamate, and d-aspartate, respectively (Fig. 5A)). In the case of N451S, the apparent affinity for sodium was much lower than that of EAAC1-WT. In contrast to EAAC1-WT, no saturation was observed at 96 mm Na+ (Fig. 5C). The sodium concentration dependence of the transport currents by N451S appeared dependent on the nature of the substrate and half of the current measured at 96 mm was observed at ∼40, 55, and 65 mm for l-aspartate, d-aspartate, and l-glutamate, respectively (Fig. 5C). However, even at 20 mm, d-aspartate and in particular l-glutamate are not saturating at 48 and 32 mm sodium any longer, in contrast to l-aspartate (data not shown). Thus, it is only possible to draw conclusions on the apparent sodium affinity in the case of l-aspartate. Clearly, the apparent affinity of N451S for sodium is reduced markedly in the presence of this substrate. It has already been shown that T370S also has a decreased apparent affinity for sodium when the currents induced by l-aspartate are measured (25.Borre L. Kanner B.I. Coupled, but not uncoupled, fluxes in a neuronal glutamate transporter can be activated by lithium ions.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Because of the differential effect of the substrates on the apparent affinity of sodium in N451S (Fig. 5C), it was important to determine whether this is also the case for T370S. The data shown in Fig. 5B demonstrate that the apparent sodium affinity of this mutant with the other two substrates was decreased as well, and no saturation by sodium was obtained for any of the three substrates. Because the substrates not only induce the stoichiometric transport currents but also augment the “uncoupled” anion conductance (3.Wadiche J.I. Arriza J.L. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Kinetics of a human glutamate transporter.Neuron. 1995; 14: 1019-1027Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 10.Wadiche J.I. Amara S.G. Kavanaugh M.P. Ion fluxes associated with excitatory amino acid transport.Neuron. 1995; 15: 721-728Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 11.Fairman W.A. Vandenberg R.J. Arriza J.L. Kavanaugh M.P. Amara S.G. An excitatory amino-acid transporter with properties of a ligand-gated chloride channel.Nature. 1995; 375: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar), we investigated whether the decreased apparent substrate affinity of N451S is also seen when the anion conductance is monitored. To achieve this, 48 mm NaSCN was used to iso-osmotically replace half of the 96 mm NaCl. The conductance of thiocyanate is ∼70-fold higher than that of chloride (43.Wadiche J.I. Kavanaugh M.P. Macroscopic and microscopic properties of a cloned glutamate transporter/chloride channel.J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 7650-7661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and under these conditions, the substrate-induced currents are dominated by the anion conductance, especially at positive potentials. The outward currents at positive potentials reflect the entry of thiocyanate into the oocytes. In oocytes expressing EAAC1-WT, the three substrates induced similar currents in the presence of thiocyanate (Fig. 6A). In contrast, in the case of N451S, only l-aspartate induced robust currents at positive potentials (Fig. 6B). The corresponding currents induced by d-aspartate were diminished dramatically, and l-glutamate did not induce any currents in oocytes expressing N451S at positive potentials (Fig. 6B). The specificity of the substrate is illustrated by the fact that both with EAAC1-WT and N451S, GABA, also used at 20 mm, had only very small effects, if any (Fig. 6, A and B). The fact the blocker d,l-threo-β-benzyloxyaspartate, used at 600 μm, suppressed the anion conductance both in EAAC1-WT and in N451S (Fig. 6, A and B), indicates that the anion conductance per se is not altered in the mutant but merely its modulation by substrates. Because of the results documented in Fig. 6B, the apparent substrate affinity of the induced anion conductance for N451S at +40 mV could only be determined for l-aspartate and the concentration giving a half-maximal effect was found to be 2.8 ± 0.4 mm (n = 3) (Fig. 7A), almost 10-fold higher than that of the coupled current (Fig. 3). However, with EAAC1-WT, the apparent affinity for the three substrates was similar to that of the coupled current, namely 3.2 ± 0.1, 4.3 ± 0.3 and 11.5 ± 1.2 μm (n = 3) for l-aspartate, d-aspartate, and l-glutamate, respectively (Fig. 7C). In the case of T370S, there was only a small differential effect on the voltage dependence of the currents induced by the substrates in the presence of thiocyanate (supplemental Fig. 1). Nevertheless, the apparent affinity for the substrates by T370S also was reduced markedly. The substrate concentrations giving a half maximal effect were 108 ± 17, 317 ± 14 and 1437 ± 135 μm for l-aspartate, d-aspartate, and l-glutamate, respectively (Fig. 7B). Except for substitution by serine, Asn-451 of the neuronal glutamate transporter EAAC1 is functionally irreplaceable (Fig. 1). Our finding that N451S exhibits transport activity enabled us to provide evidence that Asn-451 also controls substrate selectivity (Figs. 2, 3, 6, and 7), in addition to cation selectivity (Fig. 4). Such a change in cation selectivity, with l-aspartate as substrate, was shown originally for T370S (25.Borre L. Kanner B.I. Coupled, but not uncoupled, fluxes in a neuronal glutamate transporter can be activated by lithium ions.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, with N451Q, which was defective in transport, a decrease in the apparent affinity for both sodium and lithium was observed when the ability of these cations to induce conformational changes was monitored (35.Larsson H.P. Wang X. Lev B. Baconguis I. Caplan D.A. Vyleta N.P. Koch H.P. Diez-Sampedro A. Noskov S.Y. Evidence for a third sodium-binding site in glutamate transporters suggests an ion/substrate coupling model.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 13912-13917Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In the case of EAAC1-WT, l-aspartate, l-glutamate, and d-aspartate exhibit similar Km and Imax values (Fig. 2A) (37.Menaker D. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. The substrate specificity of a neuronal glutamate transporter is determined by the nature of the coupling ion.J. Neurochem. 2006; 99: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The Imax of N451S for l-aspartate was somewhat higher than that of the other two substrates (Fig. 2B). However, the apparent affinity for the acidic amino acid substrates was decreased dramatically both in the absence or presence of thiocyanate (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 7, respectively). This is in harmony with the observation that the α-carboxylate group of l-aspartate directly interacts with the corresponding asparagine residue (Asn-401) in GltPh (23.Boudker O. Ryan R.M. Yernool D. Shimamoto K. Gouaux E. Coupling substrate and ion binding to extracellular gate of a sodium-dependent aspartate transporter.Nature. 2007; 445: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Moreover, the apparent substrate affinity of N451S is not reduced to the same extent for each of the substrates: the interaction with d-aspartate and l-glutamate is more dramatically affected than with l-aspartate (FIGURE 3, FIGURE 7). Apparently, the perturbation of the binding pocket differentially impairs the interactions of the three substrates. We found that the most conservative substitutions of Asn-451, N451D, and N451Q, were deficient in transport (Fig. 1), and a similar observation for N451Q was made in another recent study (35.Larsson H.P. Wang X. Lev B. Baconguis I. Caplan D.A. Vyleta N.P. Koch H.P. Diez-Sampedro A. Noskov S.Y. Evidence for a third sodium-binding site in glutamate transporters suggests an ion/substrate coupling model.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 13912-13917Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The lack of activity of the N451D mutant is probably due to the repulsion between the introduced negative charge and that of the α-carboxylate group of the substrate. Moreover, because the N451D mutation replaces the amide nitrogen by an oxygen atom, hydrogen bond formation is impaired. In the case of the N451Q mutation, the length of the side chain is increased, and this could be detrimental for the interaction of the amide group and the α-carboxylate group of the substrate. Because Asn-451, together with Thr-370, has been implicated in the interaction with the “third” Na+, either directly and/or indirectly via the substrate (35.Larsson H.P. Wang X. Lev B. Baconguis I. Caplan D.A. Vyleta N.P. Koch H.P. Diez-Sampedro A. Noskov S.Y. Evidence for a third sodium-binding site in glutamate transporters suggests an ion/substrate coupling model.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 13912-13917Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), it is also possible that the lack of activity of N451Q may be due to an impaired Na+ coordination. We reasoned that substitution of the asparagine by a shorter residue, which still has hydrogen bonding potential, may fulfill the requirements for transport. Indeed the N451S mutant exhibits significant transport (Fig. 1). In contrast to N451Q, which is only capable to perform sodium-induced conformational changes but cannot interact with the substrate (35.Larsson H.P. Wang X. Lev B. Baconguis I. Caplan D.A. Vyleta N.P. Koch H.P. Diez-Sampedro A. Noskov S.Y. Evidence for a third sodium-binding site in glutamate transporters suggests an ion/substrate coupling model.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 13912-13917Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), the N451S mutant represents a tool to probe the proposed role of the substrate at the Na3 site. According to the current kinetic models of the glutamate transport cycle, two Na+ bind before the acidic amino acid substrate followed by the binding of the third cation (44.Watzke N. Bamberg E. Grewer C. Early intermediates in the transport cycle of the neuronal excitatory amino acid carrier EAAC1.J. Gen. Physiol. 2001; 117: 547-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 45.Bergles D.E. Tzingounis A.V. Jahr C.E. Comparison of coupled and uncoupled currents during glutamate uptake by GLT-1 transporters.J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 10153-10162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The finding that the apparent affinity for different transported amino acids depends on the nature of the co-transported cation (37.Menaker D. Bendahan A. Kanner B.I. The substrate specificity of a neuronal glutamate transporter is determined by the nature of the coupling ion.J. Neurochem. 2006; 99: 20-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), suggested the possibility that the substrate may participate directly in the coordination of the “third” Na+ (or Li+) in a similar way as has been shown for LeuT (46.Yamashita A. Singh S.K. Kawate T. Jin Y. Gouaux E. Crystal structure of a bacterial homologue of Na+/Cl-dependent neurotransmitter transporters.Nature. 2005; 437: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar). The proposed Na3 site (35.Larsson H.P. Wang X. Lev B. Baconguis I. Caplan D.A. Vyleta N.P. Koch H.P. Diez-Sampedro A. Noskov S.Y. Evidence for a third sodium-binding site in glutamate transporters suggests an ion/substrate coupling model.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2010; 107: 13912-13917Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) is in perfect harmony with this idea. We found that in contrast to EAAC1-WT (Fig. 4A), Li+ cannot support transport by N451S and only Na+ can do so (Fig. 4C). This change in cation selectivity of substrate transport is consistent with the proposed Na3 site, although this does not rule out explanations involving long range effects of the mutation on a distant cation site. Nevertheless, it is striking that when Thr-370, which is also proposed to participate in the Na3 site, is mutated to serine a similar change in cation selectivity is observed ((25.Borre L. Kanner B.I. Coupled, but not uncoupled, fluxes in a neuronal glutamate transporter can be activated by lithium ions.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) and Fig. 4B)). In addition to the changed cation selectivity of N451S, also the apparent Na+ affinity of this mutant was decreased relative to EAAC1-WT (Fig. 5), at least when l-aspartate was the substrate. The apparent substrate affinity of T370S (25.Borre L. Kanner B.I. Coupled, but not uncoupled, fluxes in a neuronal glutamate transporter can be activated by lithium ions.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 40396-40401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) is impacted less severely than that of N451S (Fig. 7), presumably because the T370S mutation is more conservative than the mutation of Asn-451 to serine. Therefore it is likely that the differential shift in the apparent affinity for Na+ with the three substrates seen with N451S (Fig. 5C), is not observed with T370S (Fig. 5B). Despite this, the conservative T370S mutation nevertheless changes the cation selectivity of transport (Fig. 4B) (25.Borre L. Kanner B.I. Coupled, but not uncoupled, fluxes in a neuronal glutamate transporter can be activated by lithium ions.J. Biol.

All three substrates were able to activate the uncoupled anion conductance of EAAC1-WT (Fig. 6A), but in the case of N451S, only l-aspartate could do so at the testable concentrations (Fig. 6B). In contrast to the 30-fold reduction in apparent affinity for l-aspartate by N451S in the presence of chloride (Fig. 3), an almost 1000-fold reduction in apparent affinity was seen monitoring the activation of the anion conductance (Fig. 7, A and C). It is possible that l-glutamate and d-aspartate are capable of stimulating the anion conductance. However, their apparent affinity is so low that it is not possible to detect it at usable concentrations. In the case of the more conservative T370S mutation, the apparent substrate affinities were also reduced, but to a lesser extent than with N451S (Fig. 7B). The results suggest that the interaction of the substrate with the binding pocket during the activation of the uncoupled anion conductance, is different from that required during coupled transport. The distinct cation specificity of the anion conductance in EAAC1-WT (25.Borre L. Kanner B.I.

https://openalex.org/W2020179035,"Calmodulin (CaM) was shown to be essential for survival of lower eukaryotes by gene deletion experiments. So far, no CaM gene deletion was reported in higher eukaryotes. In vertebrates, CaM is expressed from several genes, which encode an identical protein, making it difficult to generate a model system to study the effect of CaM gene deletion. Here, we present a novel genetic system based on the chicken DT40 cell line, in which the two functional CaM genes were deleted and one allele replaced with a CaM transgene that can be artificially regulated. We show that CaM is essential for survival of vertebrate cells as they die in the absence of CaM expression. Reversal of CaM repression or ectopic expression of HA-tagged CaM rescued the cells. Cells exclusively expressing HA-CaM with impaired individual calcium binding domains as well as HA-CaM lacking the ability to be phosphorylated at residues Tyr99/Tyr138 or trimethylated at Lys115 survived and grew well. CaM mutated at both Ca2+ binding sites 3 and 4 as well as at both sites 1 and 2, but to a lesser degree, showed decreased ability to support cell growth. Cells expressing CaM with all calcium binding sites impaired died with kinetics similar to that of cells expressing no CaM. This system offers a unique opportunity to analyze CaM structure-function relationships in vivo without the use of pharmacological inhibitors and to analyze the function of wild type and mutated CaM in modulating the activity of different target systems without interference of endogenous CaM.

Calmodulin (CaM) 7The abbreviation used is:CaMcalmodulin. is a highly conserved Ca2+ binding protein expressed in animals, plants, fungi, and protozoa (1.Chin D. Means A.R. Calmodulin: A prototypical calcium sensor.Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 322-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). CaM is involved in a plethora of cellular functions, including growth factor signaling, cell cycle progression, transcriptional regulation, and programmed cell death. More than 100 CaM binding proteins have been identified, of which several are critical for the regulation of cell proliferation (2.Yap K.L. Kim J. Truong K. Sherman M. Yuan T. Ikura M.

However, analysis of the functional involvement of CaM in target protein activities in cells is far from complete. CaM null mutations are lethal in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Aspergillus nidulans, and Drosophila melanogaster (reviewed in Ref. 13.Schmalzigaug R. Ye Q. Berchtold M.W.

So far, no CaM gene deletions in vertebrates have been reported, and it is not known how CaM supports cell survival in these organisms. One potential obstacle might have been that higher eukaryotes express an identical CaM protein from multiple genes, making gene deletions a difficult task (14.Berchtold M.W. Egli R. Rhyner J.A. Hameister H. Strehler E.E. Localization of the human bona fide calmodulin genes CALM1, CALM2, and CALM3 to chromosomes 14q24-q31, 2p21.1-p21.3, and 19q13.2-q13.3.Genomics. 1993; 16: 461-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). calmodulin. CaM regulates the activity of most of its binding partners in a Ca2+-dependent manner (reviewed in Ref. 4.Hook S.S. Means A.R. Ca2+/CaM-dependent kinases: From activation to function.Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 471-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). However, CaM can activate some of its targets in a Ca2+-independent manner (15.Jurado L.A. Chockalingam P.S. Jarrett H.W. Apocalmodulin.Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 661-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Moreover, different CaM target proteins appear to require a distinct number of calcium ions in the Ca2+-CaM complex to attain maximum binding efficiency (16.Dagher R. Peng S. Gioria S. Fève M. Zeniou M. Zimmermann M. Pigault C. Haiech J. Kilhoffer M.C. A general strategy to characterize calmodulin-calcium complexes involved in CaM target recognition: DAPK and EGFR calmodulin binding domains interact with different calmodulin-calcium complexes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2011; 1813: 1059-1067Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Upon Ca2+ binding, CaM undergoes large conformational changes. Both pairs of EF-hands adopt an open conformation, thereby exposing hydrophobic patches to potential binding proteins (1.Chin D. Means A.R. Calmodulin: A prototypical calcium sensor.Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 322-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar). Six different classes of CaM binding proteins have been defined depending on the mode of CaM interaction and activation of the target protein (1.Chin D. Means A.R. Calmodulin: A prototypical calcium sensor.Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 322-328Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1139) Google Scholar, 17.Hoeflich K.P. Ikura M. Calmodulin in action: Diversity in target recognition and activation mechanisms.Cell. 2002; 108: 739-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain of Ca2+-free CaM (apo-CaM), consisting of EF-hand 1 and 2, has a closed conformation with both EF-hands packed together, which is believed to inhibit target protein interaction (18.Swindells M.B. Ikura M. Pre-formation of the semi-open conformation by the apocalmodulin C-terminal domain and implications binding IQ motifs.Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 501-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of apo-CaM, however, adopts a semiopen conformation, which may allow binding between certain target proteins and partially exposed hydrophobic patches of CaM in the absence of Ca2+. Furthermore, the affinity for Ca2+ of the C-terminal EF-hands (Kd ≈ 10−6 m) is 10-fold greater than the affinity of the N-terminal EF-sites, with a Kd of ≈ 10−5 m (reviewed in Ref. 19.Maier L.S. Bers D.M. Calcium, calmodulin, and calcium-calmodulin kinase II: Heartbeat to heartbeat and beyond.J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 919-939Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Binding of a single calcium ion to one of the C- or N-terminal EF-hands increases the affinity of the adjacent EF-hand domain denoted as positive cooperativity among paired EF-hands. So far, investigations on the role of Ca2+ binding to CaM in cell proliferation and cell death have been restricted to lower eukaryotes (20.Geiser J.R. van Tuinen D. Brockerhoff S.E. Neff M.M.

Posttranslational modification of CaM such as tyrosine phosphorylation at residues 99 and 138 and lysine trimethylation at position 115 may play crucial roles in the modulation of the distinct cellular processes regulated by CaM (22.Benaim G. Villalobo A. Phosphorylation of calmodulin. Functional implications.Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3619-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 23.Magnani R. Dirk L.M. Trievel R.C. Houtz R.L. Calmodulin methyltransferase is an evolutionarily conserved enzyme that trimethylates Lys-115 in calmodulin.Nat. Commun. 2010; 1: 43Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). So far, the insulin receptor and the EGF receptor are the only members of the protein tyrosine kinase receptor family which have been shown to phosphorylate CaM at its tyrosine residues. Tyrosine phosphorylation by non-receptor protein tyrosine kinases such as Src family kinases has been described as well (reviewed in Ref. 22.Benaim G. Villalobo A. Phosphorylation of calmodulin. Functional implications.Eur. J. Biochem. 2002; 269: 3619-3631Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Although tyrosine phosphorylation of mammalian CaM has been shown to affect target interaction and activation in vitro, its significance for cell proliferation is not yet known. Trimethylation of CaM at Lys115 is known as a conserved modification found in many organisms (reviewed in Ref. 24.Klee C.B. Vanaman T.C. Calmodulin.Adv. Protein Chem. 1982; 35: 213-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). However, except from its function as a regulator of NAD kinase in plants (25.Harding S.A. Oh S.H. Roberts D.M. Transgenic tobacco expressing a foreign calmodulin gene shows an enhanced production of active oxygen species.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1137-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), its functional significance in higher eukaryotes is unknown so far. Here, we describe the establishment of a CaM knock-out system in chicken pre-B lymphoma DT40 cells allowing conditional CaM expression and demonstrate its usefulness for studying the significance of Ca2+ binding and posttranslational modifications of CaM for cell survival. The chicken bursa of Fabricius cell line DT40 WT was provided by Dr. T. Kurosaki (Kansai Medical University, Osaka, Japan), and the DT40 clone 8-5 was described previously (13.Schmalzigaug R. Ye Q. Berchtold M.W. Calmodulin protects cells from death under normal growth conditions and mitogenic starvation but plays a mediating role in cell death upon B-cell receptor stimulation.Immunology. 2001; 103: 332-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). For propagation of cells, design of CaMI gene targeting, rat CaM knock-in (pCaMI KO) and HA-CaM vectors, see supplemental material. Cell density was adjusted to 0.5 × 105/ml, and the cells were further grown with or without tetracycline (1 μg/ml). Every other day, the cell densities were readjusted to 0.5 × 105/ml to maintain exponential growth. For 4–6 days, cells were counted twice a day. Doubling time was estimated from linear trend lines. Percentage of viable cells was estimated using flow cytometry. Extraction of total cellular proteins and Western blotting was done as described previously (26.la Cour J.M. Mollerup J. Winding P.

After transfer, the membranes were treated with 0.2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde to immobilize CaM (reviewed in Ref. 24.Klee C.B. Vanaman T.C. Calmodulin.Adv. Protein Chem. 1982; 35: 213-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Antibodies used for this work were as follows: monoclonal mouse anti-CaM antibody (Millipore 05-173), HA11 antibody (Covance 16B12), and rabbit polyclonal anti-phospho-Tyr99 CaM antibodies (Millipore 09-295). Quantification of protein signals was done by densitometry of scanned films using ImageJ software. A chicken CaMI-specific cDNA probe (a fragment comprising most of CaMI intron 1 and part of exon 2) was used for hybridization with genomic DNA digested with EcoR1. Northern blots containing total RNA, isolated as described in Ref. 27.Tarabykina S. Møller A.L. Durussel I. Cox J. Berchtold M.W.

Chem. 2000; 275: 10514-10518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar were probed with a 400-bp chicken CaMI cDNA probe. In chicken, two CaM genes (CaMI and CaMII) are expressed and both are translated into the same CaM protein, which is identical to all known vertebrate CaMs. For targeting the first allele of the chicken CaMI gene in the cell line DT40 8-5, which has both CaMII alleles deleted (13.Schmalzigaug R. Ye Q. Berchtold M.W. Calmodulin protects cells from death under normal growth conditions and mitogenic starvation but plays a mediating role in cell death upon B-cell receptor stimulation.Immunology. 2001; 103: 332-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), a plasmid construct was prepared containing 2.2-kb 5′-flanking region and 1.8-kb chicken CaMI 3′-flanking region (see supplemental Materials and Methods and Fig. S1). Homologous recombination with chicken genomic DNA interrupted exon 3, which prevented the expression of functional chicken CaMI. The tetracycline transactivator was introduced into the cells by cotransfection. Two clones (1G3 and 1B3) were found to exhibit the correct genomic status (CaMII−/−, CaMI−/+ rat CaMIII, shown for 1G3 in Fig. 1A). These cells expressed much higher levels of CaM as compared with the levels of CaM in the parental cell line 8-5 in the absence of tetracycline (Fig. 1B, bottom). The 1G3 cell line was further used to eliminate the remaining chicken CaMI allele. The cells were transfected with the same construct as used to knock out the first CaMI allele but with a Zeocin resistance cassette and without the rat CaMIII cassette (supplemental Fig. S1). Southern blot analysis showed that three of the newly generated clones (ET1-50, ET1-52, and ET1-55) had both CaMI alleles disrupted (Fig. 1A). Repression of CaM expression was analyzed by growing the cells under various tetracycline concentrations. Northern blot analysis showed that after 48 h of tetracycline treatment, rat CaMIII transcripts were no longer detectable when at least 0.01 μg/ml tetracycline or more was applied (Fig. 1B, top; shown for clone 1G3). The level of the remaining CaM (Fig. 1B, bottom), originating from the second allele of chicken CaMI after down-regulation of rat CaMIII, was sufficient to allow cell growth. Both ET1-50 and ET1-55 cell lines showed markedly elevated CaM levels due to ectopic expression as compared with DT40 wild type cells (Fig. 1C). CaM concentrations were 13.5 times higher in ET1-50 cells and 10.4 times higher in ET1-55 cells as compared with DT40 WT cells. However, in both cell lines, the CaM expression levels were 4.4 times lower than in WT cells 72 h after addition of tetracycline. A marked reduction in cell proliferation was noticed after addition of tetracycline in the two knock-out cell lines. Growth of ET1-55 cells stopped 75 h after tetracycline addition and growth of ET1-50 cells after 92 h (Fig. 2A). The latter cell line expresses higher levels of CaM without tetracycline repression and had a slower decline in CaM epression following tetracycline repression (Fig. 1C). These experiments were done with 1 and 5 μg/ml tetracycline, which are nontoxic concentrations as shown for the DT40 WT cell line, which grew similar to untreated cells in the presence of 5 μg/ml tetracycline (Fig. 2A). These data demonstrate that CaM is essential for growth and survival of DT40 cells. Cell growth could be recovered by removing tetracycline from the medium 2 to 3 days after the start of the tetracycline treatment (Fig. 2B). To study the significance of CaM for cell growth and survival, we ectopically expressed HA-tagged CaMwt and CaM mutants in the above described ET1-50 knock-out cells. After the tetracycline-dependent down-regulation of CaM expression, these cells relied completely on HA-CaM (Fig. 3A). This experimental strategy allows the stable expression of HA-CaM mutants independently of their ability to support growth, as CaMwt is present as long as its synthesis was not stopped by adding tetracycline. The HA tag allows differentiation between tetracycline-dependent CaM and mutant HA-CaM, as the latter runs slower on SDS gels and may further be detected independently with an anti-HA antibody. To compensate for variations in HA-CaM expression, several clones stably expressing HA-CaM at various levels derived from DT40 and ET1-50 cells were established. Three days after addition of tetracycline, no significant differences in the relative cell survival were observed in any cell line (Fig. 3A). From day 4 to day 7, the relative survival of tetracycline treated ET1-50 cells decreased dramatically, and repression of CaM expression was lethal for ET1-50 cells, as from day 6 on no living cells could be detected (Fig. 3A). In contrast, the survival of cell lines expressing HA-CaM did not decrease during the entire period measured. Furthermore, the relative survival of untreated and tetracycline-treated HA-CaM cell lines were indistinguishable. These data indicate that HA-CaM can support cell survival after repression of CaM synthesis. Moreover, our results provide evidence for the essential survival function of CaM in vertebrate cells, as down-regulation of CaM in ET1-50 led to cell death. DT40 wt cells without inducible CaM expression and wt cells stably expressing HA-CaM showed similar growth and survival characteristics, indicating that neither the HA tag nor the transfection itself had any deleterious effects. In addition to cell survival, cell proliferation of the HA-CaM cell lines was measured from day 4 on, when ET1-50 cells had a significantly reduced survival following repression of CaM (Fig. 3, B and C). The three HA-CaM cell lines had a similar doubling time as ET1-50 except that ET1-50 2G10 grew with a slightly increased doubling time in the presence of tetracycline. In contrast, ET1-50 cells did not proliferate 96 h after addition of tetracycline. This is consistent with the increased cell death following CaM repression (Fig. 3A). Forty eight hours after addition of tetracycline, CaM expression in ET1-50 cells and in the three cell lines expressing HA-CaM decreased to a level below the expression level in DT40 wt cells (see Figs. 3C and 1C). After 72 h, untagged CaM was no more detectable in these cell lines as in tetracycline treated ET1-50 cells when they started to die. Thus, cell survival was maintained by HA-CaM. From hereon, the CaM expression level in HA-CaM and non HA-CaM expressing ET1-50 cell lines remained at a non-detectable level. Based on these results cell survival measurements were started at day 3. HA-CaM expression in the three analyzed clones was similar (Fig. 3C), indicating that the slightly reduced proliferation rate of ET1-50 2G10 was not caused by low expression of the HA-tagged CaM. Note that a slightly weaker signal at higher electrophoretic mobility appeared for HA-CaM (Fig. 3C) most likely derived from an alternative in frame start codon in the HA sequence. The importance of Ca2+ binding to CaM for its function in cell proliferation and survival was explored by analyzing cells expressing CaM with either disrupted single or multiple Ca2+ binding sites (see supplemental “Materials and Methods” and Table 1). Conversion of Asp to Ala at position 1 of each Ca2+ binding loop in the EF-hand makes it impossible for CaM to bind Ca2+ (28.Xia Y. Tsai A.L. Berka V. Zweier J.L.

Down-regulation of CaM expression was performed in two clones for each mutation with the following controls: DT40wt, HA-CaMwt as well as ET1-50 cells, which do not express HA-CaM. After 4 days of tetracycline treatment, CaM was not detectable by Western blots in any of the cell lines with mutant HA-CaM as shown before for the HA-CaMwt cell lines (Fig. 3C).TABLE 1Plasmids containing HA-CaM variantsPlasmid nameChanges in CaM proteinDisrupted functionHA-CaMwt gptHA-CaM1 gptD20ACa2+ binding to EF-hand 1HA-CaM2 gptD56ACa2+ binding to EF-hand 2HA-CaM3 gptD93ACa2+ binding to EF-hand 3HA-CaM4 gptD129ACa2+ binding to EF-hand 4HA-CaM1,2 gptD20A + D56ACa2 + binding to EF-hands 1 + 2HA-CaM3,4 gptD93A + D129ACa2 + binding to EF-hands 3 + 4HA-CaM1,2,3,4 gptD20A + D56A + D93A + D129ACa2 + binding to EF-hands 1 + 2 + 3 + 4HA-CaM(K115R) gptK115RTrimethylation of Lys115HA-CaM(Y99F) gptY99FPhosphorylation of Tyr99HA-CaM(Y138F) gptY138FPhosphorylation of Tyr138HA-CaM(Y99F/Y138F) gptY99F + Y138FPhosphorylation of Tyr99 + Tyr138 Open table in a new tab Cell lines relying on single Ca2+ binding site mutant proteins CaM1, CaM2, CaM3, and CaM4 survived and grew similarly as compared with CaMwt (Table 2). Cell lines with mutated Ca2+ binding domain 4 grew slightly slower than wild type but exhibited a similar survival profile (Table 2). Cells relying on HA-CaM1,2 grew exponentially up to 6 days (Fig. 4A), and the survival was similar to the HA-CaMwt cell line 2G9 until 5 days after tetracycline addition, but they started to die from hereon (Fig. 4A). The decrease in cell survival was markedly slower than in tetracycline-treated ET1-50 cells (Fig. 4A), and the CaM1,2 cells reached similar density as tetracycline-treated ET1-50 2G9 cells (Fig. 4B). In contrast, double mutation of sites 3 and 4 showed reduced growth already after 4 days, and the cell survival was reduced markedly at 5 days after tetracycline addition. CaM1,2,3,4 cells showed the same proliferation and survival profile as tetracycline-treated ET1-50 control cells (Fig. 4, A and B). The observed phenotypes of the cell lines CaM1,2,3,4, CaM3,4, and CaM1,2 cannot be explained by differential expression of HA-CaM as similar HA-CaM levels were observed in these cell lines after a 4-day tetracycline treatment (Fig. 4C). In addition, both cell lines with the same HA-CaM mutant exhibited very similar growth and survival characteristics (Fig. 4, A and B).TABLE 2Growth and survival of cells expressing mutant CaM proteinsCell lineDT40ET1-50CaMwtCaM1CaM2CaM3CaM4CaM(Y99F)CaM(Y138F)CaM(Y99F/ Y138F)CaM(K115R)Average doubling times without tetracycline treatmentdt10.2 ± 0.710.7 ± 0.312.1 ± 0.011.3 ± 0.113.0 ± 0.013.1 ± 0.514.0 ± 0.210.7 ± 0.312.2 ± 1.611.0 ± 0.610.7 ± 0.8Percentage of live cells relative to DT40 cellss310089.8 ± 1.392.3 ± 2.589.7 ± 0.596.8 ± 1.194.0 ± 2.992.9 ± 0.987.2 ± 2.891.4 ± 3.094.3 ± 1.199.4 ± 0.9s610088.8 ± 3.783.7 ± 8.691.9 ± 2.097.6 ± 0.396.5 ± 4.5103.0 ± 3.492.8 ± 2.889.9 ± 2.591.6 ± 0.392.7 ± 0.9s910085.1 ± 4.791.4 ± 1.187.9 ± 2.0100.0 ± 0.599.2 ± 0.087.0 ± 5.393.4 ± 0.685.1 ± 2.991.0 ± 1.598.3 ± 0.4 Open table in a new tab As CaM has been associated with the regulation of the cell cycle (29.Kahl C.R. Means A.R. Regulation of cell cycle progression by calcium/calmodulin-dependent pathways.Endocr. Rev. 2003; 24: 719-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar), we examined whether a lack of CaM or replacement of CaM with various mutants unable to bind Ca2+ at either two or four Ca2+ binding sites affected the cell cycle distribution. No significant alteration of the cell cycle profile was observed in either ET1-50 cells during CaM down-regulation or representative cell lines expressing solely HA-CaMwt, HA-CaM1,2, CaM3,4, and HA-CaM1,2,3,4 (supplemental Fig. S2). As tyrosine phosphorylation of CaM has been shown to be important for some functions of CaM (22.Benaim G. Villalobo A. Phosphorylation of calmodulin. Functional implications.Eur. J.

Characterization of tyrosine phosphorylation-defective calmodulin mutants.Protein Expr. Purif. 2005; 41: 384-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), we substituted Tyr99 and Tyr138, respectively, to Phe both as single mutations and in combination. Initial experiments showed that CaM phosphorylated at Tyr99 is present in DT40 cells (supplemental Fig. S3A). All cell lines expressing Tyr phosphorylation site mutant proteins grew with similar characteristics as compared with the parental cell line, indicating that phosphorylation of Tyr99 and/or Tyr138 is not required for growth and survival of DT40 cells (Table 2). Mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of trimethyl Lys in the CaM protein purified from DT40 cells (supplemental Fig. S3B). The mass per charge (m/z) of 2401.111 Da corresponding to the peptide HVMTNLGEK(CH3)3LTDEEVDEMIR was found in CaM from DT40 cells but not in recombinant vertebrate CaM produced in Escherichia coli. Both recombinant and DT40-derived CaM contain a peptide with the m/z of 2359.079 corresponding to the same peptide without trimethylated Lys115. Two cell lines stably expressing HA-tagged CaM(K115R) were studied following repression of CaMwt. Cell proliferation and survival of these cell lines exclusively relying on CaM(K115R) were comparable with cell lines expressing HA-CaMwt, indicating that this modfication is not essential for DT40 cell survival (Table 2). As Lys115 may be a site of ubiquitination, and methylation may decrease the susceptibility of CaM for proteasomal degradation (31.Gregori L. Marriott D. West C.M. Chau V. Specific recognition of calmodulin from Dictyostelium discoideum by the ATP, ubiquitin-dependent degradative pathway.J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5232-5235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we tested the stability of HA-CaM(K115R) compared with HA-CaMwt by pulse-chase labeling and found no difference (supplemental Fig. S4). CaM is considered a central and essential mediator of Ca2+ signals in the regulation of numerous cellular activities of all eukaryotic cells (reviewed in Ref. 32.Berridge M.J.

Extensive knowledge about the structure of CaM and its interaction with target proteins has been generated mostly by in vitro approaches. However, investigations of the role of CaM in vivo by genetic means have so far been restricted to lower eukaryotic organisms (reviewed in Ref. 13.Schmalzigaug R. Ye Q. Berchtold M.W.

https://openalex.org/W2054214498,"Bak is a prototypic pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family protein expressed in a wide variety of tissues and cells. Recent studies have revealed that Bcl-2 family proteins regulate apoptosis as well as autophagy. To investigate whether and how Bak exerts a regulatory role on autophagy-related events, we treated independent cell lines, including MN9D neuronal cells, with nigericin, a K(+)/H(+) ionophore. Treatment of MN9D cells with nigericin led to an increase of LC3-II and p62 levels with concomitant activation of caspase. Ultrastructural examination revealed accumulation of autophagic vacuoles and swollen vacuoles in nigericin-treated cells. We further found that the LC3-II accumulated as a consequence of impaired autophagic flux and the disrupted degradation of LC3-II in nigericin-treated cells. In this cell death paradigm, both transient and stable overexpression of various forms of Bak exerted a protective role, whereas it did not inhibit the extent of nigericin-mediated activation of caspase-3. Subsequent biochemical and electron microscopic studies revealed that overexpressed Bak maintained autophagic flux and reduced the area occupied by swollen vacuoles in nigericin-treated cells. Similar results were obtained in nigericin-treated non-neuronal cells and another proton ionophore-induced cell death paradigm. Taken together, our study indicates that a protective role for Bak during ionophore-induced cell death may be closely associated with its regulatory effect on maintenance of autophagic flux and vacuole homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W1971933737,"The Phox homology (PX) domain is a functional module that targets membranes through specific interactions with phosphoinositides. The p47(phox) PX domain preferably binds phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P(2)) and plays a pivotal role in the assembly of phagocyte NADPH oxidase. We describe the PI(3,4)P(2) binding mode of the p47(phox) PX domain as identified by a transferred cross-saturation experiment. The identified PI(3,4)P(2)-binding site, which includes the residues of helices α1 and α1' and the following loop up to the distorted left-handed PP(II) helix, is located at a unique position, as compared with the phosphoinositide-binding sites of all other PX domains characterized thus far. Mutational analyses corroborated the results of the transferred cross-saturation experiments. Moreover, experiments with intact cells demonstrated the importance of this unique binding site for the function of the NADPH oxidase. The low affinity and selectivity of the atypical phosphoinositide-binding site on the p47(phox) PX domain suggest that different types of phosphoinositides sequentially bind to the p47(phox) PX domain, allowing the regulation of the multiple events that characterize the assembly and activation of phagocyte NADPH oxidase."

The aim of this study was to determine the role played by protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) in the absence of interferon-α (IFNα) response associated with insulin resistance. We induced insulin resistance by silencing IRS-2 or by treating HepG2 cells with tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) and analyzed insulin response by evaluating Akt phosphorylation and IFNα response by measuring Stat-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and 2',5'-oligoadenylate synthase and myxovirus resistance gene expression. The response to IFNα was also measured in insulin-resistant obese mice (high fat diet and ob/ob mice) untreated and treated with metformin. Silencing IRS-2 mRNA induces insulin resistance and inhibits IFNα response. Likewise, TNFα suppresses insulin and IFNα response. Treatment of cells with pervanadate and knocking down PTP-1B restores insulin and IFNα response. Both silencing IRS-2 and TNFα treatment increase PTP and PTP-1B activity. Metformin inhibits PTP and improves IFNα response in insulin-resistant cells. Insulin-resistant ob/ob mice have increased PTP-1B gene expression and activity in the liver and do not respond to IFNα administration. Treatment with metformin improves this response. In HepG2 cells, insulin resistance provokes IFNα resistance, which is associated with an increased PTP-1B activity in the liver. Inhibition of PTP-1B activity with pervanadate and metformin or knocking down PTP-1B reestablishes IFNα response. Likewise, metformin decreases PTP-1B activity and improves response to IFNα in insulin-resistant obese mice. The use of PTP-1B inhibitors may improve the response to IFNα/ribavirin therapy."

The STRADα-LKB1 pathway plays critical roles in epithelial cell polarity, neuronal polarity, and cancer metastasis. Though much attention is given to the STRADα-LKB1 pathway, the function of STRADα itself, including a role outside of the LKB1 pathway, has not been well-studied. Data in Caenorhabditis elegans suggest that STRADα has an LKB1-independent role in regulating cell polarity, and therefore we tested the hypothesis that STRADα regulates cancer cell polarity and motility when wild-type LKB1 is absent. These results show that STRADα protein is reduced in LKB1-null cell lines (mutation or homozygous deletion) and this partial degradation occurs through the Hsp90-dependent proteasome pathway. The remaining STRADα participates in cell polarity and invasion, such that STRADα depletion results in misaligned lamellipodia, improper Golgi positioning, and reduced invasion. To probe the molecular basis of this defect, we show that STRADα associates in a complex with PAK1, and STRADα loss disrupts PAK1 activity via Thr423 PAK1 phosphorylation. When STRADα is depleted, PAK1-induced invasion could not occur, suggesting that STRADα is necessary for PAK1 to drive motility. Furthermore, STRADα overexpression caused increased activity of the PAK1-activating protein, rac1, and a constitutively active rac1 mutant (Q61L) rescued pPAKThr423 and STRADα invasion defects. Taken together, these results show that a STRADα-rac1-PAK1 pathway regulates cell polarity and invasion in LKB1-null cells.

Mouse knock-out studies support a role for LKB1 in lung cancer invasion and metastasis, since in a mutant k-ras driven mouse model of lung cancer, LKB1 inactivation led to lung carcinomas with more frequent metastasis compared with tumors lacking p53 or Ink4a/Arf (21.Ji H.

LKB1 modulates lung cancer differentiation and metastasis.Nature. 2007; 448: 807-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Thus, these data support a role for STRADα-LKB1-inactivation in the invasion and metastasis of lung tumors. To date, most studies have focused on LKB1 function and its role in cancer progression, motility, and metastasis. However, the molecular details of how STRADα itself functions and how its function is regulated have not been well described. A report in Caenorhabditis elegans shows an LKB1-independent function of STRADα (22.Kim J.S. Hung W. Narbonne P. Roy R. Zhen M. C. elegans STRADα and SAD cooperatively regulate neuronal polarity and synaptic organization.Development. 2010; 137: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), suggesting that STRADα could have roles outside of the LKB1 pathway in human cancer. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that STRADα can function in cancer cell motility when wild-type LKB1 is absent. To do this, STRADα expression, regulation, and functionality were examined in LKB1 wild-type and null cell lines. These data show that STRADα protein is reduced in all LKB1 mutant cell lines tested compared with LKB1 wild-type cells, and this partial degradation occurs through the canonical Hsp90-dependent proteasome pathway. The remaining STRADα participates in maintaining proper cell polarity during cancer cell motility through a rac1-PAK1 cell polarity/motility pathway. Based upon these data, we conclude that STRADα regulates PAK1 in LKB1-null cells to oversee cancer cell polarity and invasion. All cell lines were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified chamber with 5% CO2. ATCC-recommended media (RPMI 1640 or DMEM) were used for each cell line, supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Keratinocyte Serum Free Media supplemented with Bovine Pituitary Extract (BPE) and Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) was used for Beas-2b epithelial lung cells. Human plasma fibronectin (Chemicon/Millipore, Billerica, MA) at 5 μg/cm2 diluted in RPMI 1640 (supplemented with 10% FBS) was added to the cell culture dish and incubated at 37 °C for 20 min prior to plating cells for experiments. Antibodies against LKB1 (Abcam, Cambridge, MA), STRADα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), ubiquitin (Cell Signaling/Millipore, Billerica, MA), HA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), GAPDH (Cell Signaling), actin (Sigma), tubulin (Millipore), and pPAKThr423 (Cell Signaling), anti-GFP (Covance, Princeton, NJ), Hsp90 (Cell Signaling), Myc (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) antibodies were used for Western blotting and immunofluorescence. Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) was used to transfect cells with the GFP:LKB1, GFP:LKB1 K78M, racQ61L, FLAG-STRADα, and the myc-PAK1 according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection. Oligofectamine (Invitrogen) was used for small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfections according to the manufacturer's protocol. LKB1 siRNA and STRADα siRNA were used at 100 nmol/liter in two successive 24-hour transfections. The LKB1 siRNA was a different sequence than the LKB1 shRNA. To inhibit protein translation, cells were treated with 100 μm cycloheximide (Acros Organics, Morris Plains, New Jersey) solubilized in water, at various time points. Proteasome inhibition was accomplished using MG-132 (Peptide Institute, Osaka, Japan) dissolved in DMSO. MG-132 was added to cells at 50 μm and incubated at 37 °C for 6 h, or 5–10 μm for 24 h. The Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin (Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY) was used at 10 μm. Cells were harvested and lysed in TNES solution (50 mm Tris pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, Roche Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture) at 4 °C. When preparing soluble and insoluble fractions, a high-salt lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm Na3VO4, 2 mm sodium molybdate, 2 mm Na4P2O7, and Complete Protease Inhibitors) was added to cells and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. The soluble fraction was collected after a 30 min at 2100 × g spin at 4 °C, and the pellet (insoluble fraction) was sonicated in an equivalent volume of high salt lysis buffer to disrupt the aggregate. Cell lysates were boiled for 5 min with protein loading buffer prior to SDS-PAGE. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). Equal concentrations of protein from whole-cell lysates were solubilized in SDS sample buffer and separated on SDS 12.5% polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the resultant membrane was blocked in 10% milk, then probed with primary antibodies diluted in 5% BSA for a minimum of 1 h at room temperature up to overnight at 4 °C. This was followed with the appropriate secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibody and visualized by chemiluminescence. Cells were fixed on coverslips with PHEMO buffer (68 mmol/liter PIPES, 25 mmol/liter HEPES, 15 mmol/liter EGTA, 3 mmol/liter MgCl2, 10% DMSO) with 3.7% formaldehyde, 0.05% glutaraldehyde, and 0.5% Triton X-100. After washing in PBS, coverslips were blocked in 10% BSA for 30 min and processed according to Ref. 14.Zhang S. Schafer-Hales K. Khuri F.R. Zhou W. Vertino P.M. Marcus A.I.

Cells were imaged using a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope using a 20× Plan-Apo objective (NA = 0.75). Image analysis of the LKB1 and STRADα signal was performed on confocal images using Metamorph software. DAPI fluorescence was used to identify the nucleus and used to create an object of the nucleus. A region of interest was then created by the software outlining the nucleus, which was transferred to the corresponding LKB1 or STRADα image. The average fluorescence intensity was then quantified within this region of interest from thresholded images to generate nuclear intensity. To determine cytoplasmic intensity the nuclear object was subtracted from the corresponding LKB1 or STRADα image (to leave the cytoplasm) then the cytoplasmic mean fluorescence intensity was quantified from the thresholded image. All images in the same cell line were acquired with identical settings and thresholded the same. Cell polarity measurements were done as previously described in Ref. 14.Zhang S. Schafer-Hales K. Khuri F.R. Zhou W. Vertino P.M. Marcus A.I.

Total RNA was isolated from cells using Qiagen's RNeasy Mini Kit and subsequently reverse-transcribed with M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). The resultant cDNA was amplified using primers specific for LKB1 and STRADα, and analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR using SYBR Green detection. Reactions (25 ul) contained 1 μl of DNA, 0.2 μm primers, and 12.5 μl of IQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). The reaction protocol began with a 3 min hot start at 95 °C and followed with cycles of 95 °C, 10 s; 55 °C, 60 s. Melt curve analysis verified a single product. Relative quantities were calculated, standardized by comparison to 18 S rRNA (small ribosomal subunit)(23.Lucas M.E. Crider K.S. Powell D.R. Kapoor-Vazirani P. Vertino P.M.

Primers used were as follows: STRADα (forward-GCCATGTCCCCTTTAAGGAT, reverse-TCATGGTCAGCTCCTCAGC), 18 S (forward-GAGGGAGCCTGAGAAACGG, reverse-GTCGGGAGTGGGTAATTTGC). BD Biocoat Matrigel invasion chambers (BD Biosciences, Sparks, MD) were loaded with 0.5 × 105 cells in serum-free media that had been treated with control or STRADα siRNA, or transfected with PAK1 or a rac1 Q61L mutant as described above. The well surrounding the Matrigel insert was partially filled with complete media (RPMI 1640 with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) supplemented with fibronectin. The cells were incubated for 18–24 h at 37 °C to allow invasion to occur. Membranes from the inserts were fixed and stained according to the manufacturer's protocol, and mounted on slides for imaging with a Zeiss Axioplan upright microscope using a 10× objective. Cells were lysed in buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors (50 mm Tris, 400 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 25 mm NaF, 2 mm Na2VO4, sodium molybdate, Roche Complete Protease Inhibitor Mixture), incubated for 30 min on ice and spun down at 14,000 × g at 4 °C for 15 min. After centrifugation, the protein concentration of the supernatant was determined, and 500 μg of protein were incubated rotating with 10 μg of the appropriate antibody overnight at 4 °C. The following day, each sample was bound to Dynabeads (Invitrogen #100.03D) by incubating on a rotator for 2 h at 4 °C. After three 30-min washes with TBS (with protease and phosphatase inhibitors) at 4 °C, the bound protein was eluted in 2× Laemmli buffer for 10 min at 100 °C, and beads removed by placing tubes on a magnet. The G-LISA rac1 and cdc42 Activation Assay luminescence-based kits (Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO) were used to ascertain rac1 and cdc42 activity in HeLa and H157 cells according to general kit protocol. Cells were either transfected with FLAG-STRADα or with FLAG-pcDNA3 as previously described, then lysed in kit lysis buffer. Lysates were diluted to 1 mg/ml and assayed using anti-racI or anti-cdc42 primary antibody dilution of 1/250 and secondary HRP labeled antibody at 1/200. Readings were obtained using a SpectraMax luminometer. To test the hypothesis that STRADα could have LKB1 independent roles in cancer motility, STRADα protein levels were first assessed in LKB1 wild-type, and LKB1-null (mutation causing an early stop codon or homozygously deleted) cancer cell lines. STRADα Western blotting showed that LKB1-null cells (24.Ikediobi O.N. Davies H. Bignell G. Edkins S. Stevens C. O'Meara S. Santarius T. Avis T. Barthorpe S. Brackenbury L. Buck G. Butler A.

Similar results were observed when LKB1 expression was reduced using different LKB1-targeted shRNA and siRNA in LKB1 wild-type lung cancer cell lines (H1299 and H1703) and normal lung epithelial cells (BEAS-2b); Fig. 1B). These results were confirmed by immunofluorescence imaging, which showed that STRADα signal intensity decreased in H1299-LKB1shRNA lung cancer cells relative to isogenic control H1299 pLKO.1 cells (Fig. 1C, top). Within the cell line we observed some heterogeneity such that neighboring cells have different levels of both LKB1 and STRADα, which could be due to the dynamic localization of LKB1 (14.Zhang S. Schafer-Hales K. Khuri F.R. Zhou W. Vertino P.M. Marcus A.I. The tumor suppressor LKB1 regulates lung cancer cell polarity by mediating cdc42 recruitment and activity.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 740-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 28.Kline E.R.

Localization-specific LKB1 loss in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma metastasis.Head Neck. 2011; 33: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Similar results were also observed in H1703 pLKO.1 and H1703 LKB1 shRNA cells (Fig. 1C, bottom). Furthermore, quantitative image analysis showed that LKB1, which has both a nuclear and cytoplasmic localization (14.Zhang S. Schafer-Hales K. Khuri F.R. Zhou W. Vertino P.M. Marcus A.I. The tumor suppressor LKB1 regulates lung cancer cell polarity by mediating cdc42 recruitment and activity.Cancer Res. 2008; 68: 740-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), was successfully depleted in both the nucleus and cytoplasm in both cell lines (Fig. 1D). This resulted in corresponding decrease in STRADα nuclear and cytoplasmic intensity (Fig. 1D). To determine if reduced STRADα protein expression is mediated at the transcriptional level, quantitative real-time PCR was performed for STRADα in control H1299 pLKO.1 cells and H1299-LKB1shRNA cells. In this case, STRADα mRNA levels remained unchanged (Fig. 1E); therefore, STRADα transcription is unaffected by LKB1 depletion, suggesting that these effects are mediated at the protein level and not transcriptionally. To determine if LKB1 re-expression in LKB1-null cell lines restores STRADα protein expression, wild-type FLAG-LKB1 and a FLAG-LKB1 K78M kinase-dead mutant were transfected into LKB1-null cells. In the four lung cancer cell lines (H23, H460, H1944, and A549) and Hela cells tested, restoration of both wild-type FLAG-LKB1 and the K78M kinase-dead LKB1 mutant restored soluble STRADα levels to varying degrees (Fig. 2). Taken together, LKB1 re-expression restores STRADα levels in a kinase-independent manner, suggesting that LKB1 kinase activity is not critical for maintaining STRADα protein levels, and that LKB1-STRAD oligomerization serves as a protective mechanism for STRADα depletion. To assess how STRADα protein stability is regulated, protein synthesis was halted with cycloheximide, and STRADα levels were assessed in LKB1 wild-type H1299 lung cancer cells. Western blotting shows that STRADα is rapidly degraded and 45 min post-cycloheximide treatment, STRADα is nearly absent. In contrast, LKB1 is more stable and shows minor degradation beginning at around 75 min (Fig. 3A). The rate of STRADα degradation was similar in LKB1 wild-type pLKO.1 cells compared with H1299 LKB1 shRNA cells; however, overall STRADα levels were significantly less (supplemental Fig. S1). To determine if STRADα degradation is mediated by Hsp90, the Hsp90 inhibitor, geldanamycin was used. Dose-dependent STRADα degradation was observed (Fig. 3B), suggesting that STRADα is degraded when Hsp90 is inhibited. Furthermore, geldanamycin reduced the re-expression of STRADα when FLAG-LKB1 was transfected in LKB1-deficient H157 cells (Fig. 3C), showing that a rescue of STRADα induced by LKB1 re-expression is Hsp90-dependent. To determine if this occurs through the proteasome, the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 was used alone and in combination with geldanamycin. Both the lysis buffer-soluble and insoluble fractions were obtained, since degraded protein often is insoluble after lysis. Geldanamycin-induced degradation of STRADα could be partially reversed by co-treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 as evidenced by the re-appearance of the STRADα protein band in the soluble and insoluble fraction (Fig. 3D). This suggests that Hsp90 drives STRADα degradation through the proteasome and when the proteasome is inhibited, both soluble and insoluble STRADα accumulate. MG-132 treatment also resulted in a higher molecular weight STRADα band in both the insoluble and soluble fractions (Fig. 3D) that would be consistent with ubiquitinated STRADα, since MG-132 treatment leads to an accumulation of ubiquitinated protein (Fig. 3E, ubiquitin blot). The basal levels of this potentially ubiquitinated STRADα may also vary between cell lines since some cell lines show a prominent higher molecular weight STRADα band (Fig. 2). To determine if STRADα degradation occurs in a similar manner when LKB1 levels are reduced, LKB1 was depleted in the H1299 lung cancer cell line and BEAS-2B lung epithelial cell line in the presence and absence of MG-132. Western blotting shows that when LKB1 is depleted, STRADα levels decrease as shown previously; however, this can be partially reversed with MG-132 treatment predominantly resulting in a higher molecular weight STRADα band (Fig. 3E). This suggests that when LKB1 is absent, STRADα is partially degraded through the proteasome. Results show that STRADα is partially degraded when LKB1 is absent; however, a significant fraction of STRADα still remains (FIGURE 1, FIGURE 2, FIGURE 3). Therefore, we wanted to determine if the remaining STRADα has a functional role in LKB1-null cells. We investigated the role of STRADα in cancer cell polarity since STRADα regulates cell polarity independently of LKB1 in C"
https://openalex.org/W2071491635,"The ureide pathway has recently been identified as the metabolic route of purine catabolism in plants and some bacteria. In this pathway, uric acid, which is a major product of the early stage of purine catabolism, is degraded into glyoxylate and ammonia via stepwise reactions of seven different enzymes. Therefore, the pathway has a possible physiological role in mobilization of purine ring nitrogen for further assimilation. (S)-Ureidoglycine aminohydrolase enzyme converts (S)-ureidoglycine into (S)-ureidoglycolate and ammonia, providing the final substrate to the pathway. Here, we report a structural and functional analysis of this enzyme from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtUGlyAH). The crystal structure of AtUGlyAH in the ligand-free form shows a monomer structure in the bicupin fold of the β-barrel and an octameric functional unit as well as a Mn(2+) ion binding site. The structure of AtUGlyAH in complex with (S)-ureidoglycine revealed that the Mn(2+) ion acts as a molecular anchor to bind (S)-ureidoglycine, and its binding mode dictates the enantioselectivity of the reaction. Further kinetic analysis characterized the functional roles of the active site residues, including the Mn(2+) ion binding site and residues in the vicinity of (S)-ureidoglycine. These analyses provide molecular insights into the structure of the enzyme and its possible catalytic mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2136153730,"Manganese is an essential trace element, whose intracellular levels need to be carefully regulated. Mn(2+) acts as a cofactor for many enzymes and excess of Mn(2+) is toxic. Alterations in Mn(2+) homeostasis affect metabolic functions and mutations in the human Mn(2+)/Ca(2+) transporter ATP2C1 have been linked to Hailey-Hailey disease. By deletion of the yeast orthologue PMR1 we have studied the impact of Mn(2+) on cell cycle progression and show that an excess of cytosolic Mn(2+) alters S-phase transit, induces transcriptional up-regulation of cell cycle regulators, bypasses the need for S-phase cell cycle checkpoints and predisposes to genomic instability. On the other hand, we find that depletion of the Golgi Mn(2+) pool requires a functional morphology checkpoint to avoid the formation of polyploid cells."

The gp59 protein recognizes branched DNA structures found at replication and recombination sites. Binding of gp32 protein (full-length and deletion constructs) to gp59 protein measured by isothermal titration calorimetry demonstrates that the gp32 protein C-terminal A-domain is essential for protein-protein interaction in the absence of DNA. Sedimentation velocity experiments with gp59 protein and gp32ΔB protein (an N-terminal B-domain deletion) show that these proteins are monomers but form a 1:1 complex with a dissociation constant comparable with that determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. Small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) studies indicate that the gp59 protein is a prolate monomer, consistent with the crystal structure and hydrodynamic properties determined from sedimentation velocity experiments. SAXS experiments also demonstrate that gp32ΔB protein is a prolate monomer with an elongated A-domain protruding from the core. Fitting structures of gp59 protein and the gp32 core into the SAXS-derived molecular envelope supports a model for the gp59 protein-gp32ΔB protein complex.

The gp43 DNA polymerase and the gp45 clamp comprise a replisome that synthesizes the leading and lagging DNA strands, whereas the gp41 helicase and gp61 primase comprise a primosome that unwinds double-stranded DNA ahead of the replisome. The gp41 helicase loads onto fork substrates in the absence of gp32 protein (5.Jones C.E. Mueser T.C. Nossal N.G.

Understanding how T4 replication complexes assemble begins with determining how the gp59 protein recognizes the replication fork.

The gp32 protein has three domains: the N-terminal B-domain (residues 1–21) responsible for cooperative self-assembly, a core domain (residues 22–253), which contains an OB-fold motif and binds with high affinity to single-stranded DNA, and a C-terminal A-domain (residues 254–301) that contributes to interactions with other replication proteins (5.Jones C.E.

The exact role of the gp59 protein-gp32 protein interaction at this DNA branch point is not clear, but evidence suggests that gp59 protein prevents the gp43 DNA polymerase from interacting with the gp41 helicase, perhaps to prevent early progression (5.Jones C.E.

In the present study, we investigate the interaction between the gp59 and gp32 proteins using small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). 3The abbreviations used are:SAXSsmall angle x-ray scatteringAUCanalytical ultracentrifugationβ-MEβ-mercaptoethanolITCisothermal titration calorimetryBisTris2-[bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino]-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diolNSDnormalized spacial discrepancy. These structural studies are complemented by sedimentation velocity analysis of the gp59 protein-gp32 protein heterodimer complex and with isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) measurements of the formation of this complex. We verify that the interaction between gp59 protein and gp32 protein requires the C-terminal A-domain of gp32. We utilized a truncated form of the gp32 protein lacking the N-terminal B-domain, gp32ΔB, for subsequent experiments. This form of gp32 protein does not self-assemble and is less prone to aggregation, which is essential for small angle x-ray scattering experiments. The gp59 protein interacts with the gp32ΔB protein as a 1:1 complex with moderate affinity. The low-resolution SAXS envelopes of the gp59 protein:gp32 protein heterodimer indicate that it is a bent prolate structure. Models of the protein binary complex and the protein-DNA ternary complex have been generated. It appears that the gp32ΔB protein becomes more compact upon interaction with the gp59 protein. This model of the ternary complex combines the protein structure derived from the SAXS envelope with the mutational analysis of gp59 protein provided in our accompanying article (38.Dolezal D.

The expression hosts used were: Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS for the gp59 protein, E. coli AR120 for the gp32ΔA, and E. coli AR120 for gp32ΔB with plasmids under control of the T7 promoter. Full-length gp32 protein (in E. coli N4830) and 32ΔAB (in E. coli OR1265) utilize the heat inducible λPL promoter. Transfected cells were grown in Luria broth (6 liters, 28 °C for heat inducible and 37 °C for chemical inducible promoters, 45 μg/ml of ampicillin) to an A600 = 0.6 prior to induction, followed by growth for 3 h. The gp59 protein was induced with 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The gp32 protein truncation constructs in AR120 cells were induced with 100 μg/ml nalidixic acid. Vectors under λPL control were induced at 42 °C for 1 h, followed by incubation at 37 °C for 2 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and the pellets were stored at −20 °C.

Frozen cells with expressed gp59 protein were suspended in 10 ml of lysis buffer/g of cell pellet (25 mm BisTris, pH 6.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), 0.3% polyethyleneimine, and 1 mg of hen egg white lysozyme/100 ml of lysis buffer). The cells were stirred at room temperature until thawed, sonicated (70% duty cycle, 2 min), and centrifuged (18,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) to clarify. The pellet from the centrifugation was resuspended in a high salt extraction buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 m NH4Cl, 10 mm MgCl2 and 2 mm β-ME, 2 ml/g of cells) and centrifuged (18,000 × g, 30 min, 4 °C). The supernatant fraction was diluted with 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, until conductivity matched that of HA buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl), loaded onto ceramic hydroxyapatite (HA, Applied Biosystems, 10-ml bed volume, 8 ml/min) equilibrated with HA buffer A, and eluted with a 10-column volume linear gradient of HA buffer B (HA buffer A + 1 m (NH4)2SO4). To remove contaminating endogenous nucleases, pooled fractions were adjusted to 1 m (NH4)2SO4 and applied over the Poros PE (Applied Biosystems, 8-ml bed volume, 10 ml/min equilibrated with HA buffer B) where gp59 protein is in the flow-through. The Poros-PE effluent was dialyzed into HS buffer A (25 mm BisTris, pH 6.5, 75 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm β-ME) and applied to a PorosHS (Applied Biosystems, 20-ml bed volume, 8 ml/min) equilibrated with HS buffer A and eluted with a 10-column volume linear gradient of HS buffer B (HS buffer A + 1 m NH4Cl). Preparations were concentrated with a Millipore Amicon ultracentrifugation concentrator (MWCO 10,000) and stored frozen in 20% glycerol at −80 °C; yields were ∼100 mg of purified gp59 protein per 6 liters of culture. Lysates for gp32 constructs were prepared as described above for gp59 protein with variations in salt and buffer; 25 mm BisTris, pH 6.5, 50 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2 for gp32 and gp32ΔAB proteins, 25 mm BisTris, pH 6.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2 for 32ΔA; and 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2 for gp32ΔB protein. No extraction step was necessary as the proteins were in the low salt lysates. For gp32 protein constructs (except as noted for gp32ΔB), clarified lysates were applied to Q-Sepharose (QS, GE Healthcare, 60-ml bed volume, flow rate 1 ml/min) equilibrated with QS buffer A (25 mm BisTris/HCl, pH 6.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1% glycerol, and 2 mm β-ME; 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm trisodium citrate, 1% glycerol, and 2 mm β-ME for 32ΔB protein) and eluted with a 10-column volume linear gradient with QS buffer B (QS buffer A plus 1 m NaCl). To remove endogenous nucleases, the QS fractions were adjusted to 1 m NaCl and applied to Poros PE (8-ml bed volume, 10 ml/min) equilibrated with QS buffer B. The Poros PE effluents were diluted with buffer (25 mm BisTris, pH 6.5, 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, for 32ΔB) to reduce the conductivity and applied to Poros HQ (Applied Biosystems; 20-ml bed volume, flow rate 10 ml/min) equilibrated with QS buffer A, and eluted with a 10-column volume linear gradient of QS buffer B. Preparations were concentrated with a Millipore Amicon ultracentrifugation concentrator (MWCO 10,000) and stored frozen in 20% glycerol at −80 °C; yields were 100–150 mg/6 liters of culture.

Protein (250 nmol of gp59, gp32, gp32ΔA, gp32ΔB, and gp32ΔNC) and protein complexes (250 nmol of each protein) were loaded on a 0.6% agarose gel. Electrophoresis was performed at 4 °C at 50 V for 3.5 h using 50 mm Tris borate, pH 6.5, 1 mm EDTA running buffer. The gel was prepared for visualization by incubation in 0.05% SDS for 1 h, followed by incubation in SYPRO Orange (Invitrogen) overnight. Protein bands were detected using an Illumatool BLS 470 (Lightools Research). The gp32ΔB protein titrations into gp59 protein were performed with a MicroCal VP-ITC microcalorimeter (GE Healthcare, MicroCal, Northampton, MA) at 20 °C. Proteins were dialyzed against binding buffer A (25 mm BisTris, pH 6.5, 150 mm NH4Cl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm β-ME). The injection syringe contained gp32ΔB protein (883 μm) or buffer. The sample cell contained 1.4 ml of buffer for blank titrations or 25 μm gp59 protein. Control experiments (buffer into buffer, buffer into protein, and protein into buffer) were performed to determine the heats of dilution, mixing, and injection (25.Leavitt S. Freire E.

Experiments were performed in triplicate. A one-site binding model was fit to the data using Microcal Origin software. For these studies, proteins were titrated into 5′-hexachloro-6-carboxyl fluorescein (5′-Hex)-labeled DNAs. As diagrammed, a 30/30 DNA pseudo-Y junction had a 15-mer duplex with two 15-mer single-stranded overhangs and a 20/30 DNA pseudo-Y junction had a 15-mer duplex with a 5-mer 5′ overhang and a 15-mer 3′ overhang. Anisotropy was determined using a PTI QM4 fluorimeter (Photon Technology Inc., Birmingham, NJ) with excitation and emission film polarizers. The excitation wavelength was 535 nm with a band pass of 8 nm; emission was measured at 556 nm with a band pass of 2 nm. Proteins and the DNA substrates were in buffer A. Proteins were titrated into 50, 200, and 400 nm DNA (425 μl). Protein additions were extended to concentrations where the signal plateaued. Anisotropy was calculated from the relationship,r=IVV−GIVHIVV+2GIVH(Eq. 1) where G is a factor to correct for the difference in the sensitivity of the system to vertically and horizontally polarized light (27.Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. Second Ed. Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers, New York1999Crossref Google Scholar). Anisotropy was calculated from the average of 10 measurements of IVV and IVH. Binding data were analyzed using BioKin Dynafit 3 software. The DynaPro Titan (Wyatt Technologies, Santa Barbara, CA) with Dynapro temperature-controlled sampler was employed to determine the polydispersity and oligomeric state of the proteins and protein complexes. Samples (∼1 mg/ml of protein) were centrifuged (20,000 × g) or filtered (0.45 μm) just prior to measurements. Data were collected at 20 and 4 °C in a 12-μl masked cuvette. Protein samples were equilibrated in binding buffer A at the experimental temperature and 10–15, 10-s acquisitions were collected. Data were analyzed with the Dynamics instrument software. Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed with a Beckman XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Coulter, Palo Alto, CA) at 20 °C, 48,000 rpm, 295 nm using absorbance optics. Proteins were in binding buffer A. Data were collected for the gp59 and gp32ΔB proteins individually at 15 μm. The gp59 protein-32ΔB protein complex was investigated over a range of concentrations (59:32ΔB): 1:1 (20:40 μm), 1:2 (20:40 μm), 1:4 (20:80 μm), 2:1 (40:20 μm), and 4:1 (80:20 μm). Data were deconvoluted to determine sedimentation coefficient distributions using c(s) analysis in SEDFIT and SEDANAL (28.Schuck P.

The equilibrium constant for formation of the gp59-gp32B protein complex was determined by fitting a model for the formation of a heterodimer (A + B → A:B) to the scans using Sedanal. Data sets at three ratios of protein (20:20, 40:40, and 20:40 μm) were used for this analysis. Data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source beamline 15-ID (ChemMatCARS, Argonne, IL) with the Bruker 6000 CCD on the gp59-gp32ΔB protein complex, gp59 protein, gp32ΔB protein, and ovalbumin as a control.
