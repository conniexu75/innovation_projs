A critical issue concerning the clinical use of patient-specific iPSCs is the accumulation of mutations in somatic (stem) cells over an organism's lifetime. Acquired somatic mutations are passed onto iPSCs during reprogramming and may be associated with loss of cellular functions and cancer formation. Here we report the generation of human iPSCs from cord blood (CB) as a juvenescent cell source. CBiPSCs show characteristics typical of embryonic stem cells and can be differentiated into derivatives of all three germ layers, including functional cardiomyocytes. For future therapeutic production of autologous and allogeneic iPSC derivatives, CB could be routinely harvested for public and commercial CB banks without any donor risk. CB could readily become available for pediatric patients and, in particular, for newborns with genetic diseases or congenital malformations.

Recent evidence indicates that somatic cells can be reprogrammed to the pluripotent state by the overexpression of several transcription factors, including OCT4 (also known as POU5F1), SOX2, NANOG, MYC, KLF4, and LIN28 (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S.

Stewart R. et al.Induced pluripotent stem cell lines derived from human somatic cells.Science. 2007; 318: 1917-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (7596) Google Scholar). Most of the iPSC lines described thus far have been isolated from skin fibroblasts or other cell types that require harvesting via surgical interventions. For clinical application, it is desired to identify alternative reprogrammable cell types that can be readily collected without invasive procedures. Blood is a cell source that can be easily obtained from most patients. However, the reprogramming of predominantly nonadherent and slow-cycling human peripheral blood cell types has been unsuccessful to date. A very recent report described the successful reprogramming of human CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells (Loh et al., 2009Loh Y.H. Agarwal S. Park I.H. Urbach A. Huo H. Heffner G.C. Kim K. Miller J.D. Ng K. Daley G.Q. Generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from human blood.Blood. 2009; 113: 5476-5479Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar), but these cells were isolated from peripheral blood by previous G-CSF mobilization, a procedure that is frequently associated with side effects, including bone pain, headache, fatigue, and nausea (Cashen et al., 2007Cashen A.F. Lazarus H.M. Devine S.M. Mobilizing stem cells from normal donors: Is it possible to improve upon G-CSF?.Bone Marrow Transplant. 2007; 39: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In addition, more severe complications have been observed in patients with coronary artery or cerebrovascular disease (Cashen et al., 2007Cashen A.F. Lazarus H.M. Devine S.M. Mobilizing stem cells from normal donors: Is it possible to improve upon G-CSF?.Bone Marrow Transplant. 2007; 39: 577-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We have now developed a straightforward strategy to produce iPSCs from human cord blood (CB)-derived endothelial cells (ECs) by means of lentiviral overexpression of OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and LIN28. Autologous and allogeneic human CB represents a cell source that is, to date, routinely collected for public and commercial blood banks. Isolation of endothelial progenitors from CB is 10-fold more efficient than from adult peripheral blood (Murohara et al., 2000Murohara T. Ikeda H. Duan J. Shintani S. Sasaki K. Eguchi H. Onitsuka I. Matsui K. Imaizumi T. Transplanted cord blood-derived endothelial precursor cells augment postnatal neovascularization.J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1527-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar), and CB-derived cells have a significantly higher proliferation potential because of a higher telomerase activity (Ingram et al., 2004Ingram D.A. Mead L.E. Tanaka H. Meade V. Fenoglio A. Mortell K. Pollok K. Ferkowicz M.J. Gilley D. Yoder M.C. Identification of a novel hierarchy of endothelial progenitor cells using human peripheral and umbilical cord blood.Blood. 2004; 104: 2752-2760Crossref PubMed Scopus (1237) Google Scholar). CB is expected to be superior to cells isolated from aged individuals because nuclear and mitochondrial mutations tend to accumulate in adult stem cells and differentiated somatic lineages over an organism's lifetime and have been suggested to contribute to aging and cancer formation (Ono et al., 2002Ono T. Uehara Y. Saito Y. Ikehata H. Mutation theory of aging, assessed in transgenic mice and knockout mice.Mech. Ageing Dev. 2002; 123: 1543-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, Trifunovic and Larsson, 2008Trifunovic A. Larsson N.G. Mitochondrial dysfunction as a cause of ageing.J. Intern. Med. 2008; 263: 167-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Whereas epigenetic changes and loss of telomerase activity may be reversed in cells of aging individuals during the induction of pluripotent stem cells (Marion et al., 2009Marion R.M. Strati K. Li H. Tejera A. Schoeftner S. Ortega S. Serrano M. Blasco M.A. Telomeres acquire embryonic stem cell characteristics in induced pluripotent stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 141-154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), acquired chromosomal abnormalities and/or point mutations cannot be corrected during reprogramming and are likely to influence the function of iPSC derivatives. Moreover, somatic cell clones with acquired mutations that result in higher reprogramming efficiency and increased proliferation rates may become selected over those with no mutations, and thus enriched during expansion of the primary cell source. The selection of such clones would be further enhanced during reprogramming and proliferation of the resultant iPSCs, further increasing the risk of cancer formation. In view of the clinically meaningful features of CB, we aimed to establish human CB-derived iPSC (hCBiPSC) lines. In addition, we demonstrated that the resultant hCBiPSCs can give rise to functional cardiomyocytes and thus hold potential applicability in cardiac cell therapies. Recent reports suggest that the successful generation of human iPSCs may be easier to achieve from adherent and actively dividing cells than from nonadherent and slow-cycling cells. Therefore, we sought to isolate a cell type that would be present in CB in sufficient numbers and that could be easily obtained by well-established and straightforward protocols. In addition, it was crucial that the cells be adherent under standard culture conditions and maintained proliferative ex vivo. Based on these criteria, we tested cord-blood-derived endothelial cells (CBECs) for the induction of pluripotent stem cells. In contrast to adult peripheral blood (Rohde et al., 2007Rohde E. Bartmann C. Schallmoser K. Reinisch A. Lanzer G. Linkesch W. Guelly C. Strunk D. Immune cells mimic the morphology of endothelial progenitor colonies in vitro.Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 1746-1752Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar), high numbers of ECs were obtained from CB. CBECs were isolated and cultivated under EC culture conditions, yielding a monolayer of cells displaying an EC cobblestone-like morphology. Individual isolates of CBECs from different patients were compared. All CBEC isolates showed high expression of endothelial markers (CD31, CD146) and no expression of monocyte markers (CD45, CD14), as determined by flow cytometry. After five passages, a minor proportion of the cells were also CD34+ and CD133+, which may reflect a progenitor cell origin (Figure S1A available online). No remarkable differences in the expression of other genes were found among different CBEC isolates by semiquantitative RT-PCR, confirming the above results (Figure S1B). In addition, nonfractionated adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and/or monocytes isolated through adherence on tissue-culture plates, along with primary lung fibroblasts (LFs), were prepared. To induce pluripotent stem cells, we transduced LFs, CBECs, adult PBMCs, or monocytes with lentiviral vectors expressing OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and LIN28 (multiplicity of infection [MOI] of 20 each) under the control of the hEF1α promoter. Control transductions with a corresponding GFP-expressing vector with similar MOIs resulted in ∼44% GFP+ CBECs (data not shown). After 6 days in either fibroblast, endothelial, or PBMC culture medium, cells were transferred to human embryonic stem cell (hESC) culture conditions. After transduction, both PBMCs and monocytes failed to proliferate. CBECs, however, did proliferate, but the proliferation activity varied significantly among different CBEC isolates (Figure 1A). Colonies of iPSCs were first observed 20–30 days after the transduction of LFs and CBECs. Interestingly, our data suggest that the efficiency of reprogramming correlates with proliferation activity: Reprogramming experiments with adult, nonproliferative PBMCs or monocytes did not lead to the formation of ESC-like colonies (Figure 1B; Table S1). For CBECs, the reprogramming efficiency for the individual slow-cycling isolates hCBEC939, hCBEC1024, and hCBEC1197 was low, between 0.0001% and 0.0003%, resulting in 1.66 ± 3.30 colonies/106 cells (Table S1; Figures 1A and 1B). For hCBEC3 and hCBEC8 isolates, which had a significantly accelerated proliferation, reprogramming efficiency was considerably higher, between 0.01% and 0.03%, resulting in 167.92 ± 104 colonies/106 cells (Table S1; Figures 1A and 1B). This efficiency is similar to that previously found after the lentiviral transduction of fibroblasts and keratinocytes (Maherali et al., 2008Maherali N. Ahfeldt T. Rigamonti A. Utikal J. Cowan C. Hochedlinger K. A high-efficiency system for the generation and study of human induced pluripotent stem cells.Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 340-345Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). In order to identify the molecular basis of the varying proliferation capacity and reprogramming efficiency among individual hCBEC isolates, we performed quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qPCR) specific for the endogenous pluripotency genes OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, LIN28, and MYC. As expected, minimal or no expression of SOX2 and LIN28 was detected, without significant variation among individual isolates (Figure 1C). This was true also for NANOG, with the exception of the hCBEC3 isolate, which showed ∼500-fold lower expression than in human ESCs. For OCT4, expression levels were ∼200- to 500-fold lower than those in human ESCs. In contrast to the above factors, high expression levels of endogenous MYC, 2.9- to 5.7-fold higher than those in hESCs, were observed for all hCBEC isolates (Figure 1D). Notably, no significant variations among individual isolates were detected, suggesting that other cell cycle regulators contribute to the high proliferation rate and reprogramming efficiency of the hCBEC3 and hCBEC8 isolates. Eventually, we cannot exclude the possibility that the reprogramming efficiency for individual CBEC isolates depends on the presence of a specific subpopulation, for instance with a progenitor-like phenotype. However, at least for CD34+ cells, we did not observe a direct correlation between a higher proportion of these cells and the reprogramming efficiency for a specific CBEC isolate. About 50% of the isolated primary colonies either did not acquire a hESC-like appearance or could not be propagated successfully. Some clones were lost because of cell differentiation during further propagation. However, after two passages, the remaining clones assumed a typical hESC-like morphology (Figures S2A–S2F). For detailed characterization, eight hiPSC clones were cultured and expanded under typical ESC conditions on murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Thus far, one human lung fibroblast-derived iPSC (hLFiPSC) clone has been cultured for up to 71 passages, and hCBiPSC clones have been maintained for up to 59 passages. Karyotype analyses revealed no abnormalities in the hCBiPSC clones (passage 32), but trisomy of chromosome 20, which was not detected in the primary source LF, was observed in the hLFiPSC clone in passage 30 (Figure S2G). Southern blot analyses confirmed the independent origin of all assayed iPSC clones. Individual cell clones contained one to six or more copies of each transgene, with an average of ∼2.5 integrations of each vector per genome (Figure S2H, data not shown for clones hCBiPSC7, 106, 109, 119, and 120). hLFiPSCs and hCBiPSCs expressed the ESC markers OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, LIN28, SSEA-3, SSEA-4, and TRA-1-60, as demonstrated by immunocytology (Figure 2A). In the case of hCBiPSCs, reprogramming led to the removal of the original endothelial phenotype, as indicated by the loss of CD31 on undifferentiated hCBiPSCs (Figure S3). Expression levels of the transgenes were determined by qPCR in undifferentiated cells of the eight iPSC clones (Figure 2B). The degree of silencing varied between different clones and individual transgenes. Whereas the OCT4 transgene was still widely expressed at levels comparable to the endogenous gene expression, only moderate NANOG transgene expression was detected in the majority of hCBiPSC clones. Furthermore, minimal expression of transgenic SOX2 and LIN28 was detected in most iPSC clones (Figure 2B). Interestingly, in the hCBiPSC109 clone, moderate to strong expression of all transgenes was observed. As expected for iPSCs, induced expression of the endogenous counterparts of all transgenes was considerably above the levels detected in the source cells, LFs and CBECs. Although some variation among clones was evident, endogenous expression levels of OCT4, NANOG, SOX2, and LIN28 were similar to those of hESCs (Figure 2C). Again, the hCBiPSC109 clone differed from all other clones: minimal expression of endogenous OCT4 or NANOG was observed and only SOX2 and LIN28 expression was detected at high levels. In order to elucidate the reprogramming status of iPSCs generated from either LFs or CBECs, we next performed bisulfite sequencing analysis on the OCT4 regulatory region. The OCT4 promoter in both somatic cell types, LFs and CBECs, was found to be highly methylated. In contrast, the same region in the reprogrammed iPSCs was found to be significantly demethylated (Figure 2D). Thus, our data strongly suggest that hLFiPSCs and hCBiPSCs are properly reprogrammed, with an epigenetic status similar to that of ESCs. To assess the cells' in vitro differentiation capacity, we induced the differentiation of hCBiPSCs and hESC controls into embryoid bodies (EBs). Despite partially sustained transgene expression in the hCBiPSCs, both clones that have been analyzed in more detail (hCBiPSC1 and hCBiPSC2) differentiated well into derivatives of all three germ layers. Interestingly, the substantial levels of transgenic OCT4 and NANOG in undifferentiated hCBiPSCs did not block the differentiation. In general, an increase in the expression of all three germ layer markers was observed during hCBiPSC differentiation, at levels comparable to hESCs (Figure S4). RT-PCR results for β3 tubulin (neurons), cytokeratin 18 ([ectodermal] epithelium), AFP, Sox17, and HNF4 (endoderm), and desmin as well as CD31 (mesoderm) were confirmed by immunocytology (Figure 3A). Transplantation into immunodeficient SCID-beige mice resulted in the formation of typical teratomas containing derivatives of all three germ layers (Figures 3B–3E). As expected, expression of endogenous OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG decreased during the differentiation of hCBiPSC2 similar to hESCs (Figure 3F). During differentiation, endogenous OCT4 expression in hCBiPSC2 decreased by a factor of 817 (hESCs: 102), SOX2 expression by a factor of 21 (hESCs: 6), NANOG expression by a factor of 54 (hESCs: 97), and LIN28 expression by a factor of 15 (hESCs: 1.5). Interestingly, differentiation of hCBiPSC2 in our EB-based protocol also led to a sustained decrease in transgenic OCT4 expression, although by a factor of only 7. It is likely that this decrease in transgenic OCT4 does not represent the induction mechanism, but rather appears to be a secondary effect of differentiation and might actually reflect the typical silencing of the EF1α promoter during differentiation (unpublished observations). Transgenic NANOG expression, which was low, and transgenic SOX2 and LIN28 expression, which was very low, remained unchanged during differentiation (Figure 3F). Although immunocytology does not allow for the discrimination between transgene and endogenous protein expression, immunostaining specific for OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and LIN28 was performed (Figure S5). Consistent with the qPCR data, there was a strong decrease of NANOG expression during differentiation, with almost no NANOG+ cells detected on d17 of differentiation. In contrast, and again consistent with the qPCR data, SOX2 and LIN28 expression decreased considerably; however, SOX2+ and LIN28+ cells were still frequently observed until d17 of differentiation. This is in accordance with the fact that SOX2, as well as LIN28, expression is known not to be restricted to pluripotent stem cells. Despite a considerable decrease in OCT4 expression, many OCT4+ cells were still detected until d17 of differentiation. This may indicate persistent transgene expression, as demonstrated by qPCR. hCBiPSC1, hCBiPSC2, and hLFiPSCs were differentiated into EBs. hLFiPSC and the assayed hCBiPSC clones differentiated into spontaneously contracting cardiomyocytes (CMs) (Movie S1). A more detailed analysis of the cardiac differentiation of hCBiPSCs in comparison to hESCs was performed for the hCBiPSC2 clone. Typically, beating areas first appeared on d9 of differentiation, and the proportion of spontaneously contracting EBs increased up to 12%. Semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed to characterize the cardiac differentiation over time (Figure S4). A series of marker genes was included in the study: Brachyury was selected as an early mesendodermal marker; FOG2, NKX 2-5, TBX5, and TBX20 were included to follow cardiac mesoderm induction; and MLC2a and αMHC served as markers for maturing CMs. Albeit at low levels, most of the analyzed markers could already be detected in “undifferentiated” iPSCs and particularly in the cultures of the hESC line HES-3 (Figure S4). Our conventional RT-PCR data suggest an upregulation of all tested markers for mesoderm, cardiac mesoderm, and CM during differentiation. Increased expression of the cardiac mesodermal marker genes NKX 2-5 and FOG2 in differentiating iPSCs was first detected on d2 and d4 of differentiation. The expression pattern of TBX5 and TBX20 in iPSC derivatives was very similar to that of differentiating ESCs, with significant transcript levels detected on d4. Considerable levels of αMHC transcripts were also detected on d4. Figures 4A–4D show well-organized cross-striations in iPSC-derived myocytes, as demonstrated by immunostaining. Cells were positive for typical sarcomeric proteins, such as sarcomeric α-actinin or cardiac troponin T. The presence of the gap junction protein CX43 (connexin 43) between iPSC-derived troponin T+ CMs (Figure 4D) suggested functional coupling of these cells. Patch clamp experiments were performed to further characterize individual CMs after dissociation (Figures 4E–4G). iPSC-derived CMs developed spontaneous electric activity, as indicated by the typical cardiac extracellular FP shape and amplitude (Figure 4E). We observed different types of action potentials (APs): The left panel of Figure 4E depicts a ventricle-like AP with fast upstroke velocity, a plateau phase, and large AP amplitude, suggesting the contribution of both Ca2+ and Na+ channels as the main depolarizing currents. The right panel shows an AP morphology more reminiscent of pacemaker action potentials, with a slower AP upstroke, no plateau phase, and smaller AP amplitude. In Figure 4F, statistical analyses of action potentials assigned to be either ventricle- or pacemaker-like, according to the above-mentioned criteria, are shown. Finally, the sensitivity of hCBiPS-CMs to the β-sympatomimetic drug isoproterenol was investigated to demonstrate a functional β-adrenergic pathway at the single cell level. Isoproterenol led to an increase in the spontaneous action potential frequency of hCBiPSC-CMs, typical of its effect on cardiomyocytes (Figure 4G). Although additional pharmacologic characterization is mandatory, our present data already provide strong evidence for the similarity of hCBiPSC2-CMs to both hESC-CMs and ventricular human heart tissue. Clearly, the use of CB as a “young” cell source with high biological quality for the generation of iPSCs sheds new light on the customized collection and storage of autologous CB by commercial CB banks. Until now, the usefulness of autologous CB stem cells has been controversial, and their utility in the treatment of genetically based diseases, such as many types of leukemias, seems to be limited. In addition, there are issues of restricted plasticity and ex vivo proliferative capacity (Hofmeister et al., 2007Hofmeister C.C. Zhang J. Knight K.L. Le P. Stiff P.J. Ex vivo expansion of umbilical cord blood stem cells for transplantation: growing knowledge from the hematopoietic niche.Bone Marrow Transplant. 2007; 39: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). In contrast, CB is clearly useful for future therapeutic production of juvenile iPSCs, providing a cell source that could instantly be made available for thousands of pediatric patients, which is of particular relevance for newborns with inherited diseases and congenital malformations. Clinicians frequently have evidence of these defects in utero, so CB samples have been prospectively collected and stored in public CB banks with the notion that suitable therapeutic options will become available in the near future. In addition, HLA matching of allogeneic CB from public banks could be done, similar to current clinical practice in the treatment of leukemia. In conclusion, we have identified CB as a novel cell source for the derivation of iPSCs. Our study provides a feasible strategy for the reproducible generation of induced pluripotent stem cells from human cord blood. In view of the questionable quality of cells of aging individuals, allogeneic and autologous CB from public and commercial CB banks may provide a superior and almost unlimited juvenescent cell source for the production of clinically useful iPSCs. In addition, we were able to demonstrate the differentiation of human CBiPSCs into functional cardiomyocytes. Our results therefore establish an important basis for the development of iPSC-based therapies with high relevance for the treatment of pediatric patients. Plasmids pSIN-EF2-Oct-Pur, pSIN-EF2-Sox2-Pur, pSIN-EF2-Nanog-Pur, and pSIN-EF2-LIN28-Pur were obtained from Addgene (http://www.addgene.org). Viruses were produced, concentrated, and titered according to standard procedures. Human LFs were isolated from pulmonary resections and cultured under standard conditions. Written informed consent was obtained from all tissue donors according to the legal requirements. Mononuclear cells were isolated from heparinized human peripheral and cord blood through Ficoll density gradient centrifugation. For preparation of hCBECs or monocytes, either CD34+ cells recovered by immunomagnetic separation or whole mononuclear cells were enriched via plastic adherence. Human umbilical CB had been obtained from healthy newborn donors after informed parental consent. Cells were transduced with concentrated lentiviral vectors (MOI 20 each) in fibroblast or endothelial culture medium containing 8 μg/ml polybrene as described previously (Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaka T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S.

ESCs and iPSCs were cultured and expanded under standard hESC culture conditions. For EB-based differentiation, human ESCs/iPSCs were dispersed into small clumps and cultured in differentiation medium (80% IMDM supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum) in ultra-low attachment plates for 7 days. Subsequently, EBs were plated onto gelatin-coated tissue culture dishes. Teratomas were induced by injection of the cell suspension under the renal capsule or into a hind limb muscle of SCID-beige mice. After 8–10 weeks, the animals were sacrificed. During all experiments, the “Principles of laboratory animal care” (NIH publication No. 86-23, revised 1985) as well as the Animal Welfare Law of Lower Saxony were followed. Total RNA was prepared with the RNeasy Kit (Macherey-Nagel) and reverse transcribed with Superscript II by means of oligo dT primers according to manufacturer's instructions. PCR and qPCR were performed as previously described (Mauritz et al., 2008Mauritz C. Schwanke K. Reppel M. Neef S. Katsirntaki K. Maier L.S. Nguemo F. Menke S. Haustein M. Hescheler J. et al.Generation of functional murine cardiac myocytes from induced pluripotent stem cells.Circulation. 2008; 118: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). Sequences and specifications of primers are shown in Tables S2 and S3. Data are given as mean ± SEM of normalized gene expression levels from three differentiation experiments. Immunostaining was performed according to standard protocols. Primary antibodies that were used are described in Table S4. Bisulfite sequencing was performed with the EpiTect Bisulfite Kit (QIAGEN) according to manufacturer's protocol. PCR products were subcloned with the PCR 2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) and individual clones were sequenced. Clones with at least 90% cytosine conversion were accepted, and all possible clonalities were excluded based on criteria from the BiQ Analyzer software. At least 10 replicates were performed for each of the selected regions. Action potentials were measured with the whole-cell patch clamp technique in a cell-attached configuration with a current clamp as previously reported (Guan et al., 2007Guan K. Wagner S. Unsold B. Maier L.S. Kaiser D. Hemmerlein B. Nayernia K. Engel W. Hasenfuss G. Generation of functional cardiomyocytes from adult mouse spermatogonial stem cells.Circ.

Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) may serve as an unlimited source of RPE cells for transplantation in these blinding conditions.

We demonstrate that nicotinamide promotes the differentiation of hESCs to neural and subsequently to RPE fate. In the presence of nicotinamide, factors from the TGF-β superfamily, which presumably pattern RPE development during embryogenesis, further direct RPE differentiation.

These results are an important step toward the future use of hESCs to replenish RPE in blinding diseases. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which is a monolayer of cells between the neural retina and the choriocapillaris, plays crucial roles in the maintenance and function of the retina and its photoreceptors. These include the formation of the blood-retinal barrier, absorption of stray light, supply of nutrients to the neural retina, regeneration of visual pigment, and uptake and recycling of shed outer segments of photoreceptors (Strauss, 2005Strauss O. The retinal pigment epithelium in visual function.Physiol. Rev. 2005; 85: 845-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (1909) Google Scholar). Dysfunction, degeneration, and loss of RPE cells are prominent features of Best disease, subtypes of retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which is the leading cause of visual disability in the western world. In these conditions, there is progressive visual loss that often leads to blindness. A variety of therapeutic approaches to delay the degenerative process are under development, but the grim reality is that many patients eventually lose their sight. Cell therapy to replenish the degenerating RPE cells may potentially halt disease progression (da Cruz et al., 2007da Cruz L. Chen F.K. Ahmado A. Greenwood J. Coffey P.

Neurol. 2008; 214: 347-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In the hESC system, putative RPE cells could be harvested after spontaneous differentiation at a relatively low efficiency (Klimanskaya et al., 2004Klimanskaya I. Hipp J. Rezai K.A. West M. Atala A. Lanza R. Derivation and comparative assessment of retinal pigment epithelium from human embryonic stem cells using transcriptomics.Cloning Stem Cells. 2004; 6: 217-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). More recently, improved yield of RPE-like cells was obtained after induced differentiation of hESCs with Wnt and Nodal antagonists and prolonged culture (Osakada et al., 2008Osakada F. Ikeda H. Mandai M. Wataya T. Watanabe K. Yoshimura N. Akaike A. Sasai Y. Takahashi M. Toward the generation of rod and cone photoreceptors from mouse, monkey and human embryonic stem cells.Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 215-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Here, we developed defined culture conditions to direct the differentiation of hESCs into cultures enriched for functional RPE-like cells. We show that differentiation toward neural and further toward RPE fate is augmented by nicotinamide (vitamin B3; NIC). We further show, in line with evidence for the key role of TGF-β superfamily factors in embryonic RPE patterning (Fuhrmann et al., 2000Fuhrmann S. Levine E.M. Reh T.A. Extraocular mesenchyme patterns the optic vesicle during early eye development in the embryonic chick.Development. 2000; 127: 4599-4609PubMed Google Scholar), that Activin A, in the presence of NIC, efficiently induces and augments differentiation into RPE cells within 4 weeks. Transplantation of these RPE cells into an animal model of retinal degeneration caused by RPE dysfunction protects photoreceptors and rescues retinal function, and the engrafted cells are capable of uptaking the visual pigment rhodopsin, suggesting their phagocytic function in vivo. Given the role of NIC in cell metabolism, survival, plasticity, and differentiation (Li et al., 2006Li F. Chong Z.Z. Maiese K. Cell life versus cell longevity: The mysteries surrounding the NAD+ precursor nicotinamide.Curr. Med. Chem. 2006; 13: 883-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, Otonkoski et al., 1993Otonkoski T. Beattie G.M. Mally M.I. Ricordi C. Hayek A. Nicotinamide is a potent inducer of endocrine differentiation in cultured human fetal pancreatic cells.J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1459-1466Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), we sought to study its effect on the differentiation of hESCs. We analyzed the gene expression profile of hESCs (HES1 line) after 4 weeks of spontaneous differentiation as free-floating clusters in the presence and absence of NIC by using genome-scale microarrays. Functional classification analysis of differentially expressed genes via Onto-Tools (Draghici et al., 2003Draghici S. Khatri P. Bhavsar P. Shah A. Krawetz S.A. Tainsky M.A. Onto-Tools, the toolkit of the modern biologist: Onto-Express, Onto-Compare, Onto-Design and Onto-Translate.Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3775-3781Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar) showed that the hematopoietic and the melanogenic differentiation pathways were significantly enriched (p = 2.7 × 10−4 and p = 5.7 × 10−3, respectively) in the presence of NIC (Table S1 available online). The expression of neural, early retinal, and RPE genes was upregulated above 4-fold in the presence of NIC (Table S2). In addition, NIC promoted the appearance of pigmented areas within the differentiating hESC clusters. Given these results, we further studied the effect of NIC on RPE differentiation. In serum-free medium supplemented with NIC, pigmented areas began to appear within the differentiating clusters after 4 weeks, and 72.9% ± 2.5% of the hESC clusters had pigmented cells after 8 weeks of differentiation. In the absence of NIC, pigmented areas were not observed after 4 weeks, and only 13.1% ± 4.8% of the hESC clusters developed pigmented areas after 8 weeks (Figures 1A and 1C). Within clusters that differentiated 8 weeks in the presence of NIC, 5.7% ± 1.0% of the cells were pigmented (Figure 1D), 5.4% ± 1.1% expressed the early RPE marker MiTF, and in most cases the expression of MiTF correlated with pigmentation (Figure 1B). Most of the MiTF-expressing pigmented cells coexpressed Otx2, similar to naturally developing RPE cells in the embryonic eye (Figure 1B). The effect of NIC on differentiation toward pigmented cells was confirmed in additional hESC lines (H7 and HES4; Figure S1). To determine whether the development of RPE cells in vitro recapitulates the key developmental steps of RPE in vivo, we performed time-course analysis of the expression within the hESC clusters of key markers during RPE development. Clusters differentiating in the presence or absence of NIC were analyzed by Q-PCR, FACS, and immunostaining for the expression of markers of undifferentiated hESCs, early neural differentiation, retinal, and RPE development (Figure 2). In the presence of NIC, the expression of markers of undifferentiated hESCs (Oct4, Figure 2A; TRA-1-60, Figure 2B) declined more rapidly and the process of early neural differentiation was promoted. NIC treatment increased the expression of transcripts of the early neural markers Otx2, Musashi, and Pax6 after 2, 4–6, and 2–6 weeks of differentiation, respectively (Figure 2A). FACS analysis after 4 weeks of differentiation in the presence of NIC showed that 81.3% ± 6.3% of the cells expressed the neural precursor marker polysialic acid-neural cell adhesion molecule (PSA-NCAM), as compared to 14.4% ± 5.9% in control clusters (Figure 2B). Immunostaining confirmed that at 4 weeks, the majority of cells within the NIC-treated clusters acquired a neural phenotype and expressed PSA-NCAM (76.4% ± 3.8%), Nestin (63.4% ± 10.3%), and Musashi (81.1% ± 4.9%; Figures 2C and 2D). The gene expression microarray analysis of differentiating hESCs showed that NIC treatment decreased the expression level of genes associated with apoptosis by ≥2.94-fold (Figure S2A). A potential antiapoptotic effect of NIC was further suggested by FACS analysis of the percentage of Annexin V+ apoptotic cells, which was significantly reduced in hESC clusters after 2 weeks' differentiation in the presence of NIC compared to its absence (Figure S2B). Moreover, within the NIC-treated cell population, the percentage of Annexin V+ cells was significantly lower among PSA-NCAM+ neural cells compared to PSA-NCAM− nonneural cells (Figure S2C). With regard to proliferation, immunostaining showed similar percentages of Ki67+ cells as well as similar percentages of proliferating neural cells coexpressing Nestin and Ki67 in the presence and absence of NIC (Figures S2D and S2E). Collectively, these results suggest that prevention of apoptosis of neural cells, rather than augmentation of their proliferation, was one mechanism underlying the promotion of neural differentiation by NIC. After 2 weeks of initial differentiation, NIC induced the expression of transcripts of Bf1, an anterior neural marker, whereas NIC had no effect on the level of expression of markers of midbrain (En1) and caudal (HoxC5) specification (Figure S3A). It has been suggested that during human embryogenesis, emerging early multipotent neural precursors have an anterior phenotype (Pankratz et al., 2007Pankratz M.T. Li X.J. Lavaute T.M. Lyons E.A. Chen X. Zhang S.C. Directed neural differentiation of human embryonic stem cells via an obligated primitive anterior stage.Stem Cells. 2007; 25: 1511-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). It appears that NIC augmented this early step of differentiation into neural precursors with an anterior phenotype. The expression of transcripts of Rx1 and Six3 transcription factors, which have a key role in retinal specification, was demonstrated after 2 weeks of differentiation. In the presence of NIC, the expression of these genes as well as Chx10, which regulates the proliferation of neural retinal progenitors, was increased (Figure 2A). The expression of Rx1 relative to the forebrain markers Bf1 or Otx2 was higher in the presence of NIC compared to its absence (Figures S3B and S3C), suggesting that NIC augmented retinal specification in addition to promoting anterior neuralization. In the presence of NIC, the expression of transcripts of the early RPE marker MiTF-A, RPE65, and of the more mature RPE marker Bestrophin was also augmented mainly after 4 and 8 weeks, respectively (Figure 2A). To determine the time at which NIC excreted its RPE inductive effect, we supplemented NIC at different time periods and analyzed its effect on the percentage of pigmented clusters (Figure S3D). NIC augmented RPE differentiation when applied during the first 4 weeks of culture, when neural and retinal specification occur. NIC did not augment RPE differentiation if supplemented during weeks 4 to 6, at the time window when eye field specification has occurred (see Figure 2A, green bars at 4 weeks for Six3 and Rx) and further retinal differentiation took place (see Figure 2A, green bars at 4 and 6 weeks for RPE65 and Chx10). In summary, the differentiation process of RPE within hESC clusters in vitro followed the steps that occur during embryonic development of RPE in vivo. NIC augmented this process mainly at the stage of early neural specification. The process of RPE differentiation in our system mimicked RPE development in the embryo, so we sought to evaluate whether factors that play a key role in specification and patterning of the RPE during eye development would also augment the differentiation of hESCs into RPE. Studies in the chick suggest that extraocular mesencymal-derived Activin or other factors from the TGF-β superfamily have a key role in patterning the optic vesicle into RPE (Fuhrmann et al., 2000Fuhrmann S. Levine E.M. Reh T.A. Extraocular mesenchyme patterns the optic vesicle during early eye development in the embryonic chick.Development. 2000; 127: 4599-4609PubMed Google Scholar). To test the possible role of activin signaling in our hESC differentiation system, we first demonstrated the expression of activin receptors and Activin A, after 2 weeks' differentiation in the presence of NIC (Figure 3G). At this time, the expression of early eye field markers was emerging (Figure 2A) and therefore the differentiating hESCs were probably at a developmental stage paralleling the early optic vesicle. Although transcripts of the receptors ACTRIB and ACTRIIB were expressed in the presence of NIC, no or minor expression was observed in its absence. These observations were supported by the Affymetrix gene expression analysis that showed, in the presence of NIC, a significant (p = 0.026) enrichment of the TGF-β signaling pathway among differentially expressed genes (Table S1). In the presence of NIC, Activin A significantly augmented the appearance of pigmented areas within hESC clusters differentiating for 4 weeks (Figures 3A and 3B). In the absence of NIC, the effect of Activin A treatment was not prominent (Figure 3C) and therefore further studies of the effects of Activin A were performed in the presence of NIC. Supplementation of Activin A for 2 weeks after initial 2 weeks' differentiation was optimal for enhancing RPE differentiation (data not shown). Activin A treatment significantly increased the percentage of clusters that included pigmented cells (50.7 ± 6.5 versus 17.7 ± 3.2; Figure 3H) and the percentage of pigmented cells from the total number of cells (9.9 ± 1.4 versus 2.4 ± 1.2; Figure 3I). This observation was confirmed in additional hESC lines (H7, HES4; Figure S1). The effect of Activin A on RPE differentiation was dose dependent, with optimal effect at a concentration of 140 ng/ml (Figure S4). The effect of Activin A on differentiation into pigmented clusters was significantly attenuated in the presence of SB431542, which is a selective inhibitor of TGF-β superfamily type I receptors (Figures 3E and 3H; Inman et al., 2002Inman G.J. Nicolas F.J. Callahan J.F. Harling J.D. Gaster L.M. Reith A.D. Laping N.J. Hill C.S. SB-431542 is a potent and specific inhibitor of transforming growth factor-beta superfamily type I activin receptor-like kinase (ALK) receptors ALK4, ALK5, and ALK7.Mol. Pharmacol. 2002; 62: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the absence of Activin A, the percentage of pigmented clusters was reduced after differentiation in the presence of NIC+SB431542 compared to NIC alone (Figure 3H). This effect was probably related to blocking of endogenous Activin A signaling (Figure 3G). Q-PCR time-course analysis showed that Activin A treatment augmented the expression of MiTF isoforms and Bestrophin, a marker of more mature RPE cells, after 2.5–4 weeks and 6–8 weeks of differentiation, respectively (Figure 3J). An inductive effect on RPE differentiation, similar to that of Activin A, was also observed with TGF-β1, another member of the TGF-β superfamily (Figures 3D and 3H). In contrast, treatment with basic FGF (bFGF) in the presence of NIC abolished the appearance of pigmented cells (Figure 3F). The accessibility of cells within clusters to differentiation-inducing factors in the culture medium may be limited, so we modified the differentiation conditions to include a stage of monolayer culture growth. Differentiation in the presence of NIC was initiated for a week within free-floating clusters, which were plated to form monolayer cultures of cells during the second week. Activin A was supplemented to the monolayer cultures during the third and fourth weeks. With this modification, the yield of RPE-like pigmented cells at 6 weeks was 25.2% ± 2.4% with NIC without Activin A treatment and further significantly improved to 33.4% ± 3.8% with Activin A supplementation (p < 0.05). This yield was significantly improved compared to the percentage of pigmented cells (10.1% ± 3.0%) obtained within clusters differentiating in suspension. To characterize the phenotype of the pigmented cells, hESC-differentiated clusters containing pigmented areas were partially dissociated and plated. Colonies comprised of a monolayer of the pigmented cells emerged between other types of differentiated cells (Figure 4A). The pigmented cells within the colonies acquired a polygonal shape and formed “cobble stone”-like sheets of cells (Figures 4B and 4C). Immunostaining with anti-ZO-1 showed that the cells were connected by tight junctions (Figure 4G). Electron microscopy analysis demonstrated that the hESC-derived pigmented cells had morphological properties that are highly characteristic of native RPE cells in vivo (Figures 4M–4O). Phalloidin staining showed F-actin distribution adjacent to the cell membrane, similar to naturally developing RPE cells (Figure 4D). Immunostaining showed that the pigmented cells expressed markers of both early and mature RPE cells (Figures 4E, 4F, and 4H–4J). Q-PCR analysis of differentiating hESC-clusters showed minimal, NIC-independent expression of Sox10, which is a marker of neural crest-derived melanocytes, compared to control cells of the M51 melanoma cell line (Figure 2A), further indicating that the majority of pigmented cells were not melanocytes but rather RPE-like cells. It was possible to further enrich the cultures for RPE-like cells and expand them. Pigmented areas were mechanically dissected from differentiating clusters, dissociated, and plated. The cells acquired a fibroblast-like appearance and lost their pigmentation, suggesting regression from their differentiated RPE-like state (Figure 4K). However, after an additional 4–6 weeks, cell density increased and the cells again acquired pigmentation and assumed a polygonal shape (Figure 4L). These data together with previous work (Klimanskaya et al., 2004Klimanskaya I. Hipp J. Rezai K.A. West M. Atala A. Lanza R. Derivation and comparative assessment of retinal pigment epithelium from human embryonic stem cells using transcriptomics.Cloning Stem Cells. 2004; 6: 217-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar) suggest that propagation and expansion of RPE cells may be possible. One of the most important functions of RPE cells in vivo is phagocytosis of shed photoreceptor outer segments, as part of the continuous renewal process of rods and cones. Confocal microscopy analysis of hESC-derived pigmented cells after incubation with fluorescent latex beads or mouse purified fluorescent photoreceptor outer segments showed that they could phagocyte both (Figures 4P–4R and Movies S1 and S2). The potential therapeutic effect of the hESC-derived pigmented cells was studied after subretinal transplantation in the Royal College of Surgeon (RCS) rat animal model in which primary dysfunction of the RPE occurs as a result of a mutation in the receptor tyrosine kinase gene Mertk (D'Cruz et al., 2000D'Cruz P.M. Yasumura D. Weir J. Matthes M.T. Abderrahim H. LaVail M.M. Vollrath D. Mutation of the receptor tyrosine kinase gene Mertk in the retinal dystrophic RCS rat.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2000; 9: 645-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (722) Google Scholar). This leads to impaired phagocytosis of shed photoreceptor outer segments, with secondary degeneration and loss of photoreceptors within the first months of life. For transplantation, we used genetically modified hESCs constitutively expressing eGFP (Gropp et al., 2003Gropp M. Itsykson P. Singer O. Ben-Hur T. Reinhartz E. Galun E. Reubinoff B.E.

Pigmented areas within differentiating eGFP+ hESC clusters were mechanically isolated and disaggregated, and 0.6–1 × 105 cells (of which 49%–69% were pigmented) were engrafted into the subretinal space of 29 3-week-old RCS rats. Intravitreal transplanted eyes, fellow nontransplanted eyes, vehicle-transplanted eyes, and human fibroblast-transplanted eyes served as four types of controls. Retinal function and structure was studied 5–6 weeks posttransplantation in 21 rats (Figure 5, Figure 6). In order to assess long-term effects of transplantation and to substantiate efficacy and safety, eight rats were followed up to 19 weeks posttransplantation (Figure S5).Figure 6Transplanted hESC-Derived RPE Cells Provide Functional and Structural Rescue in the RCS Rat Model of Retinal DegenerationShow full caption(A) Representative full-field ERG responses to a series of white flashes of increasing intensity in the DA state in a transplanted eye and its fellow nontransplanted eye.(B) Mean b-wave amplitudes in response to white flashes of increasing intensity.

Bars represent mean ± SEM. 5–6 weeks after transplantation, the transplanted pigmented cells could be readily identified by standard color and SLO-based fundus imaging systems (Figures 5A and 5B), and their eGFP fluorescence emission was detected when fluorescein excitation and emission filters were used (Figure 5C). Large clusters of subretinal eGFP+ cells (Figure 5D) as well as multiple, dispersed smaller clusters (Figure 5E) could be observed by a fluorescence microscope in enucleated eye cups. Histologic and immunostaining analysis 5–6 weeks after transplantation showed the subretinal location of eGFP+ pigmented cells (Figures 5F–5I). Grafts were often dispersed over a large area (Figures 5F and 5H), and pigmented cells coexpressing eGFP were clearly identified (Figures 5G and 5I). Occasionally, eGFP+ cells integrated within the host RPE (Figure 5G). Within well-defined grafts, 36.2% ± 7.2% of transplanted cells were pigmented (n = 6 eyes). Multiple transplanted cells expressed markers specific for mature RPE including RPE65 (Figures 5J and 5K) and Bestrophin (Figures 5L and 5M). The transplanted cells also formed tight junctions (Figures 5N and 5O), which is important for maintaining the blood-retinal barrier. Transplanted cells with polygonal shape were observed (Figures 5M and 5O). Further studies at 19 weeks posttransplantation demonstrated that the engrafted eGFP+ cells survi"

https://openalex.org/W1969187681,"The transmembrane protein known as FasL (Fas ligand) is a member of the tumour necrosis factor family with an important role in immune regulation. The binding of FasL with its receptor induces apoptosis, but it has not been clear how important cell death is in FasL's cellular functions. Experiments using gene-targeted mice that either lack secreted FasL but express normal levels of membrane-bound FasL or, that lack membrane-bound FasL but can still produce secreted FasL, show that soluble FasL promotes autoimmunity and tumorigenesis through mechanisms that do not involve apoptosis. Fas ligand (FasL) and its receptor Fas are critical for the shutdown of chronic immune responses and prevention of autoimmunity. FasL function is regulated by deposition in the plasma membrane and metalloprotease-mediated shedding, but it is unclear what the respective roles of these secreted and membrane-bound forms are. Gene-targeted mice that selectively lack either secreted FasL or membrane-bound FasL are now generated, shedding light on this problem. Fas ligand (FasL), an apoptosis-inducing member of the TNF cytokine family, and its receptor Fas are critical for the shutdown of chronic immune responses1,2,3 and prevention of autoimmunity4,5. Accordingly, mutations in their genes cause severe lymphadenopathy and autoimmune disease in mice6,7 and humans8,9. FasL function is regulated by deposition in the plasma membrane and metalloprotease-mediated shedding10,11. Here we generated gene-targeted mice that selectively lack either secreted FasL (sFasL) or membrane-bound FasL (mFasL) to resolve which of these forms is required for cell killing and to explore their hypothesized non-apoptotic activities. Mice lacking sFasL (FasLΔs/Δs ) appeared normal and their T cells readily killed target cells, whereas T cells lacking mFasL (FasLΔm/Δm ) could not kill cells through Fas activation. FasLΔm/Δm mice developed lymphadenopathy and hyper-gammaglobulinaemia, similar to FasLgld/gld mice, which express a mutant form of FasL that cannot bind Fas, but surprisingly, FasLΔm/Δm mice (on a C57BL/6 background) succumbed to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)-like autoimmune kidney destruction and histiocytic sarcoma, diseases that occur only rarely and much later in FasLgld/gld mice. These results demonstrate that mFasL is essential for cytotoxic activity and constitutes the guardian against lymphadenopathy, autoimmunity and cancer, whereas excess sFasL appears to promote autoimmunity and tumorigenesis through non-apoptotic activities."
https://openalex.org/W2012860082,"DNA methylation is essential for development and in diverse biological processes. The DNA methyltransferase Dnmt1 maintains parental cell methylation patterns on daughter DNA strands in mitotic cells; however, the precise role of Dnmt1 in regulation of quiescent adult stem cells is not known. To examine the role of Dnmt1 in adult hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), we conditionally disrupted Dnmt1 in the hematopoietic system. Defects were observed in Dnmt1-deficient HSC self-renewal, niche retention, and in the ability of Dnmt1-deficient HSCs to give rise to multilineage hematopoiesis. Loss of Dnmt1 also had specific impact on myeloid progenitor cells, causing enhanced cell cycling and inappropriate expression of mature lineage genes. Dnmt1 regulates distinct patterns of methylation and expression of discrete gene families in long-term HSCs and multipotent and lineage-restricted progenitors, suggesting that Dnmt1 differentially controls these populations. These findings establish a unique and critical role for Dnmt1 in the primitive hematopoietic compartment."

https://openalex.org/W2138873662,"Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are responsible for the life-long production of the blood system and are pivotal cells in hematologic transplantation therapies. During mouse and human development, the first HSCs are produced in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region. Subsequent to this emergence, HSCs are found in other anatomical sites of the mouse conceptus. While the mouse placenta contains abundant HSCs at midgestation, little is known concerning whether HSCs or hematopoietic progenitors are present and supported in the human placenta during development. In this study we show, over a range of developmental times including term, that the human placenta contains hematopoietic progenitors and HSCs. Moreover, stromal cell lines generated from human placenta at several developmental time points are pericyte-like cells and support human hematopoiesis. Immunostaining of placenta sections during development localizes hematopoietic cells in close contact with pericytes/perivascular cells. Thus, the human placenta is a potent hematopoietic niche throughout development. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are responsible for the life-long production of the blood system and are pivotal cells in hematologic transplantation therapies. During mouse and human development, the first HSCs are produced in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region. Subsequent to this emergence, HSCs are found in other anatomical sites of the mouse conceptus. While the mouse placenta contains abundant HSCs at midgestation, little is known concerning whether HSCs or hematopoietic progenitors are present and supported in the human placenta during development. In this study we show, over a range of developmental times including term, that the human placenta contains hematopoietic progenitors and HSCs. Moreover, stromal cell lines generated from human placenta at several developmental time points are pericyte-like cells and support human hematopoiesis. Immunostaining of placenta sections during development localizes hematopoietic cells in close contact with pericytes/perivascular cells. Thus, the human placenta is a potent hematopoietic niche throughout development. Hematopoiesis in the human conceptus progresses in a wave-like manner in several different embryonic sites: the yolk sac (YS), the splanchnopleura/aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region, the liver, and the bone marrow (BM) (Tavian and Peault, 2005Tavian M.

At day 19, the intraembryonic splanchnopleura becomes hematopoietic. The emergence of multipotent progenitors and HSCs, organized in clusters of cells closely adherent to the ventral wall of the dorsal aorta, starts at day 27 in the developing splanchnopleura/AGM region (Tavian et al., 1996Tavian M.

Starting at day 30, the first erythroid progenitors (BFU-E, burst forming unit erythroid) are found in the liver, with multilineage hematopoietic progenitors (CFU-Mix or -GEMM; colony forming unit granulocyte, erythroid, macrophage, megakaryocyte) appearing in this tissue at week 13 (Hann et al., 1983Hann I.M. Bodger M.P. Hoffbrand A.V. Development of pluripotent hematopoietic progenitor cells in the human fetus.Blood. 1983; 62: 118-123PubMed Google Scholar). Hematopoietic progenitors and long-term culture-initiating cells have been found in the human placenta at 8–17 weeks in gestation (Barcena et al., 2009Barcena A. Kapidzic M. Muench M.O. Gormley M.

Hematol. 2004; 32: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Thereafter, the BM becomes hematopoietic. This sequence of hematopoietic events closely parallels that found in the mouse conceptus, in which the spatial/temporal appearance and the quantitative/qualitative characteristics of hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells have been carefully mapped (Ferkowicz et al., 2003Ferkowicz M.J.

Development of erythroid and myeloid progenitors in the yolk sac and embryo proper of the mouse.Development. 1999; 126: 5073-5084Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Importantly, the developing hematopoietic cells in the conceptus are increasing in their complexity (multilineage and higher proliferative potentials) and culminate with the generation of adult-type HSCs that sustain hematopoiesis throughout adult life (Dzierzak and Speck, 2008Dzierzak E. Speck N.A. Of lineage and legacy: the development of mammalian hematopoietic stem cells.Nat. Immunol. 2008; 9: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). While the YS generates the transient embryonic erythroid cells, the AGM is the first tissue to generate more complex hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells (Cumano et al., 1996Cumano A.

The liver and the BM are thought to be colonized by these cells and provide a potent supportive microenvironment for the growth of the fetal and life-long blood system. In addition to the AGM (Cumano et al., 1996Cumano A. Dieterlen-Lievre F. Godin I.

Quantitatively, the midgestation mouse placenta contains more hematopoietic progenitors and HSCs than the AGM region and the YS, indicating that the placenta provides a potent supportive microenvironment for HSC amplification and may be, with the liver, a predominant source of adult BM HSCs (Alvarez-Silva et al., 2003Alvarez-Silva M.

In contrast to the mouse, there is little information concerning the hematopoietic potential of the human placenta (Bailo et al., 2004Bailo M. Soncini M. Vertua E. Signoroni P.B. Sanzone S.

Hematol. 2004; 32: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Human studies have focused on umbilical cord blood (UCB), revealing that it is an important and easily accessible source of potent hematopoietic progenitors and HSCs for clinical transplantation procedures (Tse et al., 2008Tse W. Bunting K.D. Laughlin M.J. New insights into cord blood stem cell transplantation.Curr. Opin. Hematol. 2008; 15: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). However, the HSC dose limitation in UCB samples and the increasing transplantation needs for treating hematologic disorders has stimulated the search for additional sources of potent HSCs and/or improved methods of ex vivo amplification of HSCs prior to transplantation. Generally, the human placenta has been thought to function as a facilitator of nutrient and waste exchange between the mother and fetus, a provider of immunoprotection for the fetus, and a producer of important factors and hormones for fetal growth (Gude et al., 2004Gude N.M. Roberts C.T. Kalionis B. King R.G. Growth and function of the normal human placenta.Thromb. Res. 2004; 114: 397-407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). In this report, we present data showing that the human placenta beginning from gestation week 6 onward contains fetal-derived immature hematopoietic progenitors and stem cells, differentially expressing CD34 through ontogeny. Furthermore, mesenchymal stromal cells, isolated from human placenta throughout development that we identify as pericyte-like cells, can support the in vitro maintenance of human cord blood hematopoietic progenitors. Together, our results show that the human placenta is a potent hematopoietic niche and a potentially useful source of cells at term for regenerative medicine. The human term placenta is comprised of the highly vascular fetal-derived chorionic plate and villi and maternally-derived blood components that circulate in the intervillous space. We examined whether the human placenta obtained at the time of delivery contains hematopoietic progenitors. Blood from inside the placenta was collected (placenta blood). The remaining cells inside the vasculature were collected in wash steps (vessels PBS) and following collagenase treatment (vessels collagenase). Finally, the placenta was dissociated after enzymatic treatment (placenta collagenase) (Figure 1A). Flow cytometric analysis for CD34 and CD38 markers was performed on human placenta cell populations and UCB (Figure 1B). CD34+CD38+ cells (mature hematopoietic progenitors) and CD34+CD38− (immature hematopoietic progenitors/HSCs) were found in the vessel PBS wash, vessel collagenase, and placenta collagenase preparations. Compared to UCB and placenta blood, the percentages of CD34+CD38− cells were increased (about 6- to 10-fold), and an extra population of cells, CD34++CD38−, was found in the vessel collagenase and placenta collagenase cell preparations. Some of these cells coexpress CD31, but not CD45, and represent a population of endothelial cells (Figure S1 available online). Hematopoietic progenitor activity in term placental cell preparations was tested in the colony forming unit (CFU) assay. Colonies with typical morphology representing all hematopoietic lineages were found in both the vessel and placenta preparations—BFU-E, CFU-G, CFU-M, CFU-GM, and CFU-Mix (Figure S2). The combined number of CFU-Cs in the placenta vessels and tissue obtained at the time of delivery (38 weeks) was found to be 8000 per 105 CD34+ cells (Figure 1C) and is a lower frequency than that found in UCB (23,000 per 105 CD34+ cells) or placental blood. This is a slight underestimate of placenta progenitor frequency since the CD34++CD38− population contains a proportion of endothelial cells: 19% for placenta vessels and 37% for tissue (Figure S1). Clonogenic hematopoietic assays were also performed on placentas obtained from the first and second gestational trimesters. Colonies of all erythromyeloid lineages were found beginning at gestational week 6, the earliest stage placenta tested (Figure 1D), and were in both the CD34+ and CD34− cell fractions. While the frequency of BFU-E remained similar between placentas obtained at gestational weeks 6, 9, and 15, abundant increases (up to 10-fold) of CFU-GM and CFU-Mix were found beginning at week 9. Until week 9, CFU-GM and CFU-Mix are mainly in the CD34− placenta fraction. Genotyping of CFU-Mix colonies from CD34+ and CD34− placenta cells (gestation week 9) revealed that the hematopoietic cells were fetal-derived (data not shown). By week 15 (and 38; term), these progenitors are in the CD34+ fraction, suggesting a developmental regulation in the appearance, phenotype, and frequency of more complex hematopoietic progenitors in the developing placenta. CD34+CD45+ hematopoietic cells are localized in the placenta villi (Figure 1E) and vasculature (Figure 1F) as shown by immunostaining of week 16 placenta sections. Hematopoietic engraftment of NOD-SCID (or Rag γC−/−) immunodeficient mice is considered the gold-standard functional assay for detection of human HSCs (hereafter called hu-SRC, human SCID repopulating cells) (Coulombel, 2004Coulombel L. Identification of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells: strength and drawbacks of functional assays.Oncogene. 2004; 23: 7210-7222Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Published results from developmental studies show that the mouse placenta contains a high number of HSCs during midgestation (Gekas et al., 2005Gekas C. Dieterlen-Lievre F. Orkin S.H. Mikkola H.K. The placenta is a niche for hematopoietic stem cells.Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 365-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar, Ottersbach and Dzierzak, 2005Ottersbach K.

Since the analogous developmental period in the human begins at approximately week 6 in gestation, first and second trimester human placentas (total of 17) were examined for hu-SRCs. Placenta cells were injected into 47 NOD-SCID recipients (Table 1), and multilineage engraftment was measured by flow cytometry and PCR.Table 1Summary of NOD-SCID Recipient Repopulation with Fetal-Derived Cells from First and Second Trimester Human Placenta CellsGestation WeekNumber of PlacentasCell Number InjectedNumber Repopulated /Number InjectedMaleFemaleTotal191121–3 × 1063aSamples for which STR profiles were established.

One recipient injected with 19 week female placenta and three recipients injected with 8 week female placenta were profiled. Open table in a new tab First and second trimester human placenta cells were prepared, and various cell doses were injected into NOD-SCID recipients. All 47 recipients were tested for donor cell engraftment with AMEL PCR for placental cells from a male conceptus and STR PCR for placenta cells from a female conceptus. Recipients were considered positive for repopulation if at least one hematopoietic tissue at the time of sacrifice (5–10 weeks postinjection) showed AMELY signal or an STR profile that matched that of the embryo. All PCR results were verified two to three times. Figure 2A shows PCR results of hematopoietic tissue DNA from recipients receiving male 6, 9, and 19 week placenta cells. The male Y-chromosome-specific AMELY fragment was found in the blood, spleen, and BM, demonstrating that engraftment was due to placenta cells from the fetal part of the placenta. Flow cytometric analysis of the recipient injected with week 9 placenta (TCB) cells shows multilineage hematopoietic engraftment (Figure 2B). Human (h)CD45+ cells were found in the blood, BM, and spleen and were of the myeloid (CD15+) and B lymphoid (CD19+) lineages. A small population of hCD34+CD38− cells, indicative of immature hematopoietic progenitors, was found in the recipient BM. BM cells from this repopulated mouse produced colonies of all myeloerythroid lineages (Figure 2C), including the most immature multilineage colonies, CFU-Mix. PCR analysis of DNA prepared from individual CFU and pooled CFU verified that these human progenitors were fetal-derived (Figure 2D). Thus, early gestational stage human placenta cells home to the BM and provide multilineage hematopoietic repopulation of NOD-SCID mice. Engraftment of NOD-SCID mice with placenta cells from female conceptuses was tested by PCR for human chromosome 17 (hChr 17) alpha-satellite DNA (Figure 2A, TC69A), followed by a forensic PCR to discriminate fetal- from maternal-derived engraftment. Fifteen highly polymorphic short tandem repeat (STR) loci normally used for human identity testing were measured, and the STR profiles of recipient NOD-SCID hematopoietic tissue DNAs were compared to embryo STR profiles. As shown for the TC69A placenta (Figure 2E), the STR profiles of the spleen and BM cells of the NOD-SCID recipient were identical to the profile of the embryo, thus demonstrating exclusive engraftment from fetal-derived female placenta cells. In summary, of the 17 placentas transplanted into a total of 47 recipients, 14 recipients (30%) were repopulated by hu-SRCs of fetal placenta origin (Table 1). To further characterize the placenta-derived hu-SRCs, transplantation experiments into NOD-SCID and Rag γC−/− mice were performed with placenta cells sorted on the basis of expression of the CD34 marker. As shown in Table 2, HSCs are both in CD34+ and CD34− fractions in 6-week-old placenta, the earliest time point tested. By 16 to 18 weeks, the HSC population appears to be enriched in the CD34+ fraction. An example of human multilineage analyses in a Rag γC−/− recipient is shown (Figure S3).Table 2Summary of NOD-SCID and Rag γC−/− recipient repopulation with CD34+ and CD34− sorted cells from first and second trimester human placentaCell Number InjectedNumber Repopulated/Number InjectedRecipientsGestation WeekCD34+CD34−CD34+CD34−NOD-SCID60.6 × 1061.9 × 1062/21/1Rag γC−/−16–170.6–1.0 × 1062 × 1061/30/4NOD-SCID16–180.06–0.6 × 1060.75–1.6 × 1061/21/2NOD-SCID19–200.5 × 1065–10 × 1061/10/2Tissue DNA from all recipients injected with human placenta cells was tested for human engraftment by AMEL PCR.

Open table in a new tab Tissue DNA from all recipients injected with human placenta cells was tested for human engraftment by AMEL PCR.

Rag γC−/− 5-day-old recipients were irradiated with 3 Gy, injected in the liver with the indicated numbers of sorted placenta cells (10 μl volume), and, 11 weeks postinjection, analyzed for human cell engraftment. Previously, it was shown that HSCs were almost undetectable in the mouse placenta at term (E18) (Gekas et al., 2005Gekas C. Dieterlen-Lievre F. Orkin S.H. Mikkola H.K. The placenta is a niche for hematopoietic stem cells.Dev. Cell. 2005; 8: 365-375Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). To examine if this was also the case for the human placenta, cells from term human placenta vessels and tissues were prepared and injected into NOD-SCID mice. Recipients were analyzed at 5 months posttransplantation for human hematopoietic cell engraftment by flow cytometric analysis and PCR. Three experiments (3 male placentas) resulted in human hematopoietic repopulation of NOD-SCID mice (Figure 3 and Table 3). hCD45+ cells (Figure 3A) were detected in the blood of a NOD-SCID recipient receiving 20 × 106 placenta tissue cells from male term placenta (tP2). The BM and spleen contained high percentages of hCD45+cells (51% and 22%, respectively) of which many were B lymphoid cells, with a few myeloid cells. Control transplantation of 20 × 106 human UCB cells showed similar levels of NOD-SCID BM engraftment (66% hCD45+, 49% hCD19+, and 6% hCD15+ cells) that were comparable to published cord blood NOD-SCID transplantation data (Bhatia et al., 1997Bhatia M. Wang J.C. Kapp U. Bonnet D. Dick J.E. Purification of primitive human hematopoietic cells capable of repopulating immune-deficient mice.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1997; 94: 5320-5325Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Collagenase-treated placenta vessel cells (7 × 106 cells injected) from tP2 (Figure 3B) also resulted in similar engraftment, with high percentages of hCD45+ cells in BM and spleen, including B lymphoid and myeloid cells. Interestingly, injection of 7 × 106 vessel cells was sufficient to highly repopulate a NOD-SCID recipient, while injections of 5–6 × 106 tissue cells from tP3 and tP1 were not (Table 3). These data suggest that placental hu-SRCs are concentrated inside the placental labyrinth, possibly attached to the vascular endothelium.Table 3Summary of NOD-SCID Recipient Repopulation by Fetal-Derived Cells from Term PlacentaTerm Placenta (Male)Cell PreparationNumber of Mice InjectedCell Number injectedBleed I (2 Months Postinjection)Bleed II (4.5–5 Months Postinjection)tP2vessel1aFlow cytometric analysis of recipient shown in Figure 3B.7 × 106++++++placenta fresh (c)1bFlow cytometric analysis of recipient shown in Figure 3A.20 × 106++++++tP3placenta fresh (cdp)21 × 106negativenegative25 × 106negativenegative1cFlow cytometric analysis of recipient shown in Figure 3C.10 × 106++++++tP1vessel121 × 106+++deadplacenta fresh (c)16 × 106+/−negativeplacenta frozen (c)1dFlow cytometric analysis of recipient shown in Figure S7.1.3 × 106++++++Term (male) placentas were treated and made into cell suspensions as indicated and injected at various cell doses into NOD-SCID recipients.

Of the 50 TFs, Cdx2 provoked the most extensive transcriptome perturbation in ESCs, followed by Esx1, Sox9, Tcf3, Klf4, and Gata3. ChIP-Seq revealed that CDX2 binds to promoters of upregulated target genes. By contrast, genes downregulated by CDX2 did not show CDX2 binding but were enriched with binding sites for POU5F1, SOX2, and NANOG. Genes with binding sites for these core TFs were also downregulated by the induction of at least 15 other TFs, suggesting a common initial step for ESC differentiation mediated by interference with the binding of core TFs to their target genes. These ESC lines provide a fundamental resource to study biological networks in ESCs and mice.

The prevailing paradigm of modern biology states that gene regulatory networks determine the identity of cells, and that their alteration by environmental factors dictates changes of cell identity, i.e., cell differentiation (Davidson, 2006Davidson E.H. The Regulatory Genome: Gene Regulatory Networks in Development and Evolution. Academic Press, Burlington, MA2006Google Scholar). Analysis of the structure and dynamics of gene regulatory networks is key to the understanding of biological systems but poses a great challenge because of the vast and manifold complexity of regulatory mechanisms. One possible approach is to carry out a systematic gene perturbation study in order to “reverse engineer” these regulatory networks. Ideally, all the transcription factors would be manipulated one at a time and in different combinations in a variety of cell types. Readout of the impact of such manipulation would be monitored in a variety of ways, including the profiling of all RNA transcripts and proteins. This type of approach is complementary to conventional studies in which systematic gene manipulations have been successfully carried out, but usually with a focus on the phenotype, e.g., cell morphology, growth property, and differentiation markers (Chambers et al., 2003Chambers I.

As a complementary approach to the comprehensive loss-of-function study of all mouse genes (Collins et al., 2007Collins F.S. Rossant J. Wurst W.

Furthermore, similar analyses of other key TFs in mouse ESCs have successfully extended the core transcriptional network (Chen et al., 2008Chen X. Xu H. Yuan P. Fang F. Huss M. Vega V.B. Wong E.

An extended transcriptional network for pluripotency of embryonic stem cells.Cell. 2008; 132: 1049-1061Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). Obviously, the analysis of many more TFs, including genes that are not expressed in ESCs, is required to explore global TF network(s) that may be outside of the core transcriptional network of Pou5f1, Sox2, and Nanog. To this end, an appropriate mouse embryonic stem cell bank could facilitate a variety of high-throughput, genome-wide analysis methodologies. Here we describe a strategy for and the establishment of TF-inducible ESC lines, and we show how these ESC lines can be used in several ways. As a proof of principle for the strategy, we characterize how an exemplary differentiation-inducing TF, Cdx2, regulates the global transcriptome and shifts the balance of gene regulatory network toward ESC differentiation. We analyzed 50 TF genes (∼3% of all 1600–2000 TFs encoded in the mouse genome; Kanamori et al., 2004Kanamori M. Konno H. Osato N. Kawai J. Hayashizaki Y. Suzuki H.

These genes were selected primarily from a set of high-priority genes involved in critical functions in mouse ESCs and their differentiation, inferred in our previous work (Matoba et al., 2006Matoba R. Niwa H. Masui S. Ohtsuka S. Carter M.G. Sharov A.A. Ko M.S. Dissecting Oct3/4-regulated gene networks in embryonic stem cells by expression profiling.PLoS One. 2006; 1: e26Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). About half the genes are expressed in undifferentiated ESCs; the other half are not expressed or are expressed at a low level in undifferentiated ESCs but are induced in differentiating ESCs. We also included genes expressed late in lineage specification (Ascl1, Ascl2, Myod1, Sox9, and Sfpi1) to see whether TFs can induce their cognate targets without their usual regulatory context for function. Three non-TF genes—Dppa5a, Gadd45a, and Tuba1a—and one empty vector were included as controls. A total of 53 genes and a control used for this work are listed in Figure 1A. To induce a specific TF, we employed the Tet-repressible gene expression system, with the expression cassette integrated at the ROSA26 locus (ROSA-TET locus) (Figure 1B; Figure S1A available online; Masui et al., 2005Masui S. Shimosato D. Toyooka Y. Yagi R. Takahashi K. Niwa H. An efficient system to establish multiple embryonic stem cell lines carrying an inducible expression unit.Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e43Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). This system makes use of the ubiquitous and relatively high expression at the ROSA26 locus (Soriano, 1999Soriano P. Generalized lacZ expression with the ROSA26 Cre reporter strain.Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 70-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (4029) Google Scholar). In the absence of doxycycline (Dox), the recombinant ROSA-TET locus expresses a polycistronic transcript for the open reading frame (ORF) of TF and Venus YFP proteins. To facilitate the detailed analyses of individual TFs, we inserted a FLAG tag at the C terminus of all transgenes, making it possible to use FLAG as a universal bait for immunological assays. In order to minimize clone-to-clone variation of gene expression level and to generate these ESCs as a permanent resource for future work, we synchronized passage numbers and performed multistep quality control of these ESCs (Figures 1B, 1F, and 1G; Supplemental Data). We first carried out control experiments and found that three medium changes at 3 hr intervals minimized unwanted perturbation associated with commonly used cell passaging while inducing the transgene fully by effectively removing Dox (Figure S2). Indeed, the control ESCs, in which an expression unit without an ORF was inserted into the ROSA-TET locus, showed only a small number of genes differentially expressed (see below). In all transgene induction experiments, we set the last medium change as 0 hr induction. We also carried out time course DNA microarray analysis of 10 ESC lines (Figure S3) and time course western blot analysis of 17 ESC lines (Figure 1D; Figure S4). Western blots showed that in all examined cases, a transgene-derived protein started to appear by 12 hr after induction and reached a maximum level by 48 hr. DNA microarray analysis showed that whereas the global transcriptome began to change within 24 hr, the expression of the majority of genes changed relatively monotonically until 72 hr (Figure S3). To capture early effects of TF induction, we looked 48 hr after induction for the expression profiling of all 54 ESC lines in the Dox+ and Dox− conditions. Except for Dox, all other culture conditions (including LIF) were the same in both Dox+ and Dox− conditions. We confirmed that each transgene expressed a protein that was detectable by an antibody against the FLAG tag by western blot and immunohistochemistry (Figures 1D and 1E; Figures S4 and S5). Immunohistochemistry also showed that TF proteins are mainly localized in the nucleus (Figure 1E; Figure S5). The induced level of a transgene was comparable among ESC lines based on the measurement of transcript levels via qRT-PCR (Figure 1C; Figure S6A). To assess the induced level of TFs at the protein level, we also carried out western blot analysis with native antibodies that detect both endogenous and exogenous TFs. As expected for TFs that are already expressed in ESCs, we detected only mild (up to 2- to 3-fold) increases in TF levels (Figures S4C and S4D). For example, the amount of STAT3 protein was induced by 2.7-fold, which was only 3.4-fold higher than that in thymus (Figure S4D). In contrast, CDX2, which is not usually expressed in ESCs, showed an ∼80-fold increase, but was only ∼2-fold higher than the highest protein level reached in the differentiated trophoblast cells (Figure S4D). These data indicate that the induced levels of TFs in this system are largely within the physiological range of gene dosage. To assess the extent of changes in global gene expression patterns, we first combined all the new microarray data obtained from 54 ESC lines with previous microarray data that we had obtained from ESCs differentiating into three cell lineages (Aiba et al., 2009Aiba K. Nedorezov T. Piao Y. Nishiyama A. Matoba R. Sharova L.V. Sharov A.A. Yamanaka S. Niwa H. Ko M.S. Defining developmental potency and cell lineage trajectories by expression profiling of differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells.DNA Res. 2009; 16: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The data sets were fully compatible because the same microarray platform was used. Principal component analysis (PCA) of all 304 microarray data sets revealed that the transcriptome state of all the TF-inducible ESCs, even after 48 hr of TF induction (Dox−), did not shift away from the zone where undifferentiated pluripotent ESCs were clustered (Figure 2A; see Table S1 for data on expression changes for all genes). This indicates that transcriptome changes measured 48 hr after TF induction reflect the early effects of the TF in undifferentiated or nearly undifferentiated ESCs, but not in more differentiated cell types. Consistent with the PCA, most of the TF-induced ESCs showed no significant morphological changes at 48 hr (data not shown). However, after 7 days of continuous induction of TFs, most of the examined ESC lines showed morphological changes indicative of differentiation (Figure S7). Interestingly, even these early effects of transcriptome changes often revealed incipient trajectories of differentiation, as shown as clusters in the “heatmap” (Figure 2B; see Table S2 for data of individual genes). This became more evident when these expression profiles were compared to the microarray data of ESCs differentiating into specific lineages (Aiba et al., 2009Aiba K. Nedorezov T. Piao Y. Nishiyama A. Matoba R. Sharova L.V. Sharov A.A. Yamanaka S. Niwa H. Ko M.S. Defining developmental potency and cell lineage trajectories by expression profiling of differentiating mouse embryonic stem cells.DNA Res. 2009; 16: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) and those of mature tissues and organs (Su et al., 2002Su A.I. Cooke M.P. Ching K.A. Hakak Y. Walker J.R. Wiltshire T. Orth A.P. Vega R.G. Sapinoso L.M. Moqrich A. et al.Large-scale analysis of the human and mouse transcriptomes.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2002; 99: 4465-4470Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). For example, ESC lines with Sox2, Pou5f1, Nrip1, and Ascl1 showed the greatest similarity to epiblast/neural cells; ESC lines with Ascl2, Cdx2, Eomes, and Esx1 showed the greatest similarity to trophoblast cells; and ESC lines with Gata3 showed the greatest similarity to primitive endoderm cells (Figure 2C). Similarly, even TFs that are known to function in late lineage specification induced expression profiles that correspond to those late-stage differentiated cells. For example, ESCs with Myod1 and Mef2c showed the greatest similarity to heart and muscle tissues, and ESCs with Sfpi1 showed the greatest similarity to lymph node, thymus, and immune cells (Figure 2D). The results were generally consistent with previously published functions of these TFs: Cdx2, Esx1, Ascl2, and Eomes (Simmons and Cross, 2005Simmons D.G. Cross J.C. Determinants of trophoblast lineage and cell subtype specification in the mouse placenta.Dev. Biol. 2005; 284: 12-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar); Sox2 and Ascl1 (Diez del Corral and Storey, 2001Diez del Corral R. Storey K.G. Markers in vertebrate neurogenesis.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2001; 2: 835-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar); and Myod1 and Mef2c (Naya and Olson, 1999Naya F.J. Olson E. MEF2: A transcriptional target for signaling pathways controlling skeletal muscle growth and differentiation.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 683-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Next, genes whose expression was affected by induction of TFs were identified via pair-wise statistical comparison (FDR < 0.05 and expression changes > 2-fold) between microarray data for the same clone in Dox+ and Dox− conditions (Figure 3A; Figures S6B and S8). Some TFs (e.g., Cdx2, Esx1, Gata3, Klf4, Sox9, and Tcf3) caused substantial changes in the transcriptome, whereas other TFs (e.g., Fem1b and Cbx8) had little effect (Figure 3B; Tables S3 and S4). For the most part, induction of TFs that were already present in ESCs (ESC lines on the left side of Figure 3B) had a smaller effect on the gene expression profile than induction of differentiation-related genes that have low endogenous expression in ESCs (ESC lines on the right side of Figure 3B). It seems reasonable that the greater the fold-induction of a TF, the greater the global perturbation of transcriptome. However, induction of Klf4 and Sox2 (and to some extent Pou5f1) resulted in a strong response even though they were already expressed in ESCs and thus showed low fold-induction of their expression levels, indicating that these TFs have an unusually dose-sensitive and potent regulatory role. As a proof of principle for the utility of the ESC lines, we report our study of Caudal type homeobox 2 (Cdx2), which was selected because of its exceptionally strong effect on the transcriptome (Figure 3B) and its unique role in mouse embryo development. Cdx2 is the earliest differentiation marker in the embryo and is highly expressed in the trophectoderm lineage (Strumpf et al., 2005Strumpf D. Mao C.A. Yamanaka Y. Ralston A. Chawengsaksophak K. Beck F. Rossant J. Cdx2 is required for correct cell fate specification and differentiation of trophectoderm in the mouse blastocyst.Development. 2005; 132: 2093-2102Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar), and the balance between Pou5f1 and Cdx2 expression shifts cell fate during preimplantation development (Niwa et al., 2005Niwa H. Toyooka Y. Shimosato D. Strumpf D. Takahashi K. Yagi R. Rossant J. Interaction between Oct3/4 and Cdx2 determines trophectoderm differentiation.Cell. 2005; 123: 917-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Time course western blot analysis showed that the product of the transgene (CDX2-FLAG) was induced to a high level within 0.5 days after removal of Dox, reaching a maximum by 48 hr and remaining very high until day 5, with a slight reduction by day 7 (Figure 4A). Antibodies against CDX2, which recognize both endogenous and exogenous CDX2, showed similar expression patterns (Figure 4A). Colony formation assays followed by alkaline phosphatase staining showed that ESCs and colonies became very flat and lost alkaline phosphatase staining, indicating that Cdx2 induction alone caused differentiation of ESCs by day 7 of induction (Figure 4B). Differentiation of the Cdx2-inducible ESC line to trophoblast cells was confirmed by positive immunostaining with trophoblast markers CDC42 (Natale and Watson, 2002Natale D.R. Watson A.J. Rac-1 and IQGAP are potential regulators of E-cadherin-catenin interactions during murine preimplantation development.Mech. Dev. 2002; 119: S21-S26Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) and ITGA7 (Klaffky et al., 2001Klaffky E. Williams R. Yao C.C. Ziober B. Kramer R. Sutherland A. Trophoblast-specific expression and function of the integrin alpha 7 subunit in the peri-implantation mouse embryo.Dev. Biol. 2001; 239: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) (Figure 4C). These data are thus consistent with the previous report of the induction of trophoblast cells from ESCs by Cdx2 overexpression (Niwa et al., 2005Niwa H. Toyooka Y. Shimosato D. Strumpf D. Takahashi K. Yagi R. Rossant J. Interaction between Oct3/4 and Cdx2 determines trophectoderm differentiation.Cell. 2005; 123: 917-929Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (838) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data confirm that transgene Cdx2-FLAG was induced by Dox, was translated properly, and was functional as CDX2 protein. Based on the DNA microarray analysis, 2090 genes were upregulated and 1699 were downregulated by 48 hr of Cdx2 induction (Figure 3A). These genes include not only direct targets of CDX2, but also indirect targets that are regulated by the direct targets. To identify direct targets of CDX2 at the genomic level, we applied ChIP-Seq to Cdx2-inducible ESCs 48–60 hr after induction. At this time, the ESCs did not yet show signs of differentiation; thus, the ChIP-Seq results reflect Cdx2 function at the very start of ESC differentiation. ChIP-western confirmed that FLAG-IP pulled down cross-linked DNA-CDX2 protein complexes in the Dox− condition (Figure 5A). Sequencing of FLAG-ChIP DNAs produced 17.59 million 36-nucleotide tags that were mapped to the latest mouse genome sequence (mm9, NCBI/NIH). We found that 5.72 million tags matched to the genome with ≤2 nucleotide mismatches; the remaining tags either did not match to the genome or matched to more than 5 different locations. We found a total of 59,098 peaks with at least 6 tags (Table S5), of which 15,855 had at least 10 tags. Significant peaks of tags (>9) were observed at 3152 loci (genes) within 15 kb upstream and downstream of the transcription start sites (TSS) (Table S6). However, only 38 genes had peaks in the promoter regions (<300 bp upstream or downstream from the TSS), which indicates that CDX2 binds mostly to more distant regulatory regions (300–15,000 bp upstream or downstream of the TSS). Figure 5B shows a typical example of peaks. Analysis of the CDX2-ChIP target sequence by CisFinder software (Sharov and Ko, 2009Sharov A.A. Ko M.S. Exhaustive search for over-represented DNA sequence motifs with CisFinder.DNA Res. 2009; (in press)Google Scholar; available at http://lgsun.grc.nia.nih.gov/CisFinder/) indeed identified one main motif and five additional variant motifs (Figure 5C). CDX2 binds mainly to a [T/C][A/C]ATAAA[A/G] motif and to its direct repeat (Figure 5D). The major motif matched the CDX2-binding motif identified by direct binding in an oligonucleotide assay (Berger et al., 2008Berger M.F. Badis G. Gehrke A.R. Talukder S. Philippakis A.A. Pena-Castillo L. Alleyne T.M. Mnaimneh S. Botvinnik O.B. Chan E.T. et al.Variation in homeodomain DNA binding revealed by high-resolution analysis of sequence preferences.Cell. 2008; 133: 1266-1276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). It is conceivable that some binding sites of TF may not be involved in the regulation of gene expression. Therefore, we used our recently published approach to identify “functional” direct targets of TF by combining TF binding information from ChIP-Seq and gene expression changes caused by TF induction (Sharov et al., 2008Sharov A.A. Masui S. Sharova L.V. Piao Y. Aiba K. Matoba R. Xin L. Niwa H. Ko M.S. Identification of Pou5f1, Sox2, and Nanog downstream target genes with statistical confidence by applying a novel algorithm to time course microarray and genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation data.BMC Genomics. 2008; 9: 269Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). The method compares binding score distributions in genes that responded to TF manipulation with those in control genes that did not respond to TF manipulation (see details in Supplemental Experimental Procedures, Table S7). Of the 3152 genes with CDX2-binding sites, the analysis revealed a total of 337 functional target genes that satisfied statistical criteria (p < 0.1 and FDR < 0.6) (Table S8). Of these genes, 334 were upregulated after the induction of Cdx2 gene, and only 3 were downregulated. Functional CDX2-target genes included Hox genes and other differentiation-associated genes, consistent with CDX2 function as an inducer of ESC differentiation (Figure 5E; Table S8). The GO annotations of CDX2 target genes are also available (Table S9). Selected target genes were also further validated by ChIP-qPCR (Figure 5F). Consistent with the ChIP-Seq data, we observed notably high enrichment of CDX2 at promoter regions of Hox genes by ChIP-qPCR validation (Figure 5F). To see the correlation between the up- or downregulated genes and CDX2-binding sites, we ranked all 25,030 genes according to the changes caused by Cdx2 induction and estimated the proportion of genes with CDX2-binding sites in a sliding window of 500 genes (Figure 5G; Tables S6 and S7). Interestingly, genes upregulated after Cdx2 induction were strongly enriched in genes with CDX2 binding, but no enrichment was observed among downregulated genes. This implies that upregulation (i.e., positive regulation) of downstream genes is mediated by direct binding of CDX2, whereas downregulation of downstream genes is not. To gain further insights into a possible mechanism for downregulation by CDX2, we used published ChIP-Seq data for 13 TFs (Table S10; Chen et al., 2008Chen X. Xu H. Yuan P. Fang F. Huss M. Vega V.B.

For each TF, we estimated the proportion of genes with its binding sites in their distal regulatory regions among genes that were up- or downregulated by CDX2 and compared this with the proportion of genes with binding sites among “control” genes unresponsive to CDX2 (response < 1.25-fold). Strikingly, a list of genes downregulated by the induction of Cdx2 was enriched in genes that carry binding sites for POU5F1, SOX2, NANOG, STAT3, and SMAD1 (Figure 5H). Because it is known that POU5F1, SOX2, and NANOG form a core transcriptional network (Boyer et al., 2005Boyer L.A. Lee T.I. Cole M.F. Johnstone S.E. Levine S.S. Zucker J.P. Guenther M.G. Kumar R.M.

https://openalex.org/W2084632633,"Arabidopsis possesses a superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. Among these, the multidrug resistance-associated protein AtMRP5/AtABCC5 regulates stomatal aperture and controls plasma membrane anion channels of guard cells. Remarkably, despite the prominent role of AtMRP5 in conferring partial drought insensitivity upon Arabidopsis, we know little of the biochemical function of AtMRP5. Our phylogenetic analysis showed that AtMRP5 is closely related to maize MRP4, mutation of which confers a low inositol hexakisphosphate kernel phenotype. We now show that insertion mutants of AtMRP5 display a low inositol hexakisphosphate phenotype in seed tissue and that this phenotype is associated with alterations of mineral cation and phosphate status. By heterologous expression in yeast, we demonstrate that AtMRP5 encodes a specific and high affinity ATP-dependent inositol hexakisphosphate transporter that is sensitive to inhibitors of ABC transporters. Moreover, complementation of the mrp5-1 insertion mutants of Arabidopsis with the AtMRP5 cDNA driven from a guard cell-specific promoter restores the sensitivity of the mutant to abscisic acid-mediated inhibition of stomatal opening. Additionally, we show that mutation of residues of the Walker B motif prevents restoring the multiple phenotypes associated with mrp5-1. Our findings highlight a novel function of plant ABC transporters that may be relevant to other kingdoms. They also extend the signaling repertoire of this ubiquitous inositol polyphosphate signaling molecule."
https://openalex.org/W1978527868,"Down Syndrome cell adhesion molecule (Dscam) genes encode neuronal cell recognition proteins of the immunoglobulin superfamily. In Drosophila, Dscam1 generates 19,008 different ectodomains by alternative splicing of three exon clusters, each encoding half or a complete variable immunoglobulin domain. Identical isoforms bind to each other, but rarely to isoforms differing at any one of the variable immunoglobulin domains. Binding between isoforms on opposing membranes promotes repulsion. Isoform diversity provides the molecular basis for neurite self-avoidance. Self-avoidance refers to the tendency of branches from the same neuron (self-branches) to selectively avoid one another. To ensure that repulsion is restricted to self-branches, different neurons express different sets of isoforms in a biased stochastic fashion. Genetic studies demonstrated that Dscam1 diversity has a profound role in wiring the fly brain. Here we show how many isoforms are required to provide an identification system that prevents non-self branches from inappropriately recognizing each other. Using homologous recombination, we generated mutant animals encoding 12, 24, 576 and 1,152 potential isoforms. Mutant animals with deletions encoding 4,752 and 14,256 isoforms were also analysed. Branching phenotypes were assessed in three classes of neurons. Branching patterns improved as the potential number of isoforms increased, and this was independent of the identity of the isoforms. Although branching defects in animals with 1,152 potential isoforms remained substantial, animals with 4,752 isoforms were indistinguishable from wild-type controls. Mathematical modelling studies were consistent with the experimental results that thousands of isoforms are necessary to ensure acquisition of unique Dscam1 identities in many neurons. We conclude that thousands of isoforms are essential to provide neurons with a robust discrimination mechanism to distinguish between self and non-self during self-avoidance."
https://openalex.org/W2043302538,"It was recently discovered that the mean dark matter surface density within one dark halo scale length - the radius within which the volume density profile of dark matter remains approximately flat - is constant across a wide range of galaxies. This scaling relation holds for galaxies spanning a luminosity range of 14 magnitudes and the whole Hubble sequence. Here we report that the luminous matter surface density is also constant within one scale length of the dark halo. This means that the gravitational acceleration generated by the luminous component in galaxies is always the same at this radius. Although the total luminous-to-dark matter ratio is not constant, within one halo scale length it is constant. Our finding can be interpreted as a close correlation between the enclosed surface densities of luminous and dark matter in galaxies."

Deregulation of these pathways contributes to the onset or to the development of tumors (1.Evangelista M. Tian H. de Sauvage F.J.

Cell. 2008; 134: 215-230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3062) Google Scholar). Constitutive activation of Hh signaling has been implicated in the growth of several human malignancies ranging from semimalignant tumors of the skin to highly aggressive cancers of the brain, pancreas, and prostate (5.Pasca di Magliano M. Hebrok M. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 903-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar, 6.Ruiz i Altaba A. Sanchez P. Dahmane N. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 361-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar). Cellular responses to Hh are initiated by ligand binding to the tumor suppressor transmembrane receptor PTCH-1 (Patched-1). This interaction releases the inhibitory effect of PTCH-1 on the seven-transmembrane signaling protein Smoothened (SMOH), thus initiating the Hh intracellular cascade, which ultimately leads to the activation and nuclear translocation of zinc finger transcription factors of the GLI family (7.Varjosalo M. Taipale J. Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 2454-2472Crossref PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). While Hh signaling favors the stabilization of the GLI2 protein by inhibiting its proteasomal degradation, it also induces the expression of GLI1 and PTCH-1 in a GLI2-dependent manner (8.Kasper M.

There is broad evidence for a functional implication of GLI2 in the development of solid tumors. For example, GLI2 knockdown with specific small hairpin RNA or antisense oligonucleotides in prostate cancer cells reduces anchorage-independent colony formation, delays tumor xenograft growth in vivo, and enhances paclitaxel chemosensitivity (9.Thiyagarajan S.

Muramaki M. Fazli L. Kim Y. Gleave M.E. Clin. Cancer Res. 2008; 14: 5769-5777Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Similarly, GLI2-specific antisense oligonucleotides inhibit the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines, through the regulation of genes implicated in cell cycle and apoptosis (11.Kim Y. Yoon J.W. Xiao X. Dean N.M. Monia B.P. Marcusson E.G. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 3583-3593Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Moreover, in a mouse tumor allograft model, Gli2 silencing in epithelial cells that constitutively express an active form of GLI2 (GLI2ΔN2) has unambiguously demonstrated the important role played by GLI2 in preventing apoptosis and promoting tumor microvascularization (12.Ji J. Kump E. Wernli M. Erb P. Int. J. Cancer. 2008; 122: 50-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Together, these data support the notion that suppression of GLI2 expression may represent a valuable therapeutic option for the treatment of several cancers (13.Rubin L.L. de Sauvage F.J. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2006; 5: 1026-1033Crossref PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Although GLI activation may result from Hh ligand- or Hh receptor-induced signaling, recent evidence has shown the possible implication of noncanonical, Hh-independent signaling pathways to regulate GLI expression and/or activity (14.Lauth M. Toftgard R. Cell Cycle. 2007; 6: 2458-2463Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Thus, the identification of pathways leading to GLI activation is critical for adequate therapeutic targeting. In this context, we have previously identified TGF-β as a potent and ubiquitous inducer of GLI1 and GLI2 expression in both normal and transformed cells (15.Dennler S. Andre J. Alexaki I. Li A. Magnaldo T. ten Dijke P. Wang X.J. Verrecchia F. Mauviel A. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 6981-6986Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). TGF-βs encompass a large family of secreted proteins. To trigger their biological effects, TGF-βs bind to type I and II serine/threonine kinase receptor complexes. Ligand-dependent receptor activation leads to the recruitment and phosphorylation of intracellular mediators of TGF-β signal transduction, namely the SMAD proteins (16.Massague J. Seoane J. Wotton D. Genes Dev. 2005; 19: 2783-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (1927) Google Scholar, 17.Schmierer B. Hill C.S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 970-982Crossref PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). In most cell types, TGF-β1 induces the activation of SMAD2 and SMAD3 and their association with SMAD4. These complexes relay signals from the cell membrane to the nucleus where SMAD3·SMAD4 complexes bind to specific cis-elements, either alone or in cooperation with other transcription factors and co-activators that regulate the transcription of TGF-β target genes (18.Javelaud D. Mauviel A. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 1161-1165Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 19.ten Dijke P. Hill C.S. Trends Biochem.

We also identify a 91-bp TGF-β responsive region whereby TGF-β recruits SMAD3 and β-catenin to induce GLI2 transcription. HaCaT immortalized human keratinocytes and HepG2 hepatocarcinoma cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (Invitrogen, Cergy-Pontoise, France). When indicated, cells were serum-starved for 16 h and treated with 5 ng/ml human recombinant TGF-β1 (R&D Systems, Lille, France). Control cultures received corresponding TGF-β vehicle buffer (4 mm HCl, 0.1% bovine serum albumin). Cycloheximide and actinomycin D were obtained from Euromedex (Strasbourg, France). Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were purchased from Ambion/Applied Biosystems (Courtabœuf, France). Total RNA was prepared using a column-based commercial kit (Macherey-Nagel, Hoerdt, France). Genomic DNA-free RNA was then converted into cDNA using the ThermoScript RT-PCR system (Invitrogen). cDNAs were used for multiplex PCR according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Qiagen, Courtabœuf, France), real-time PCR using a Power SYBR Green mixture on an AB7300 apparatus (Applied Biosystems), or for 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5′-RACE). PCR primer sequences and specific PCR conditions are available upon request. 5′-RACE was performed using a commercial kit (Invitrogen). cDNA synthesis was performed using total RNA from HaCaT cells primed with the following gene-specific primer, 5′-AGAGATCATGGAGAGCGTGG located in exon 4 of the GLI2 gene. PCR of the dC-tailed cDNA was performed with the AAP primer included in the kit, together with a primer corresponding to a sequence located in exon 2 of human GLI2: 5′-ATCTCAGCCGCTCATCGTC. Finally, nested PCR was performed using the AUAP primer of the kit and the exon 1 primer: 5′-TTGGGGAAGCTTCTGACCTTGCTCTTTGATGTG, which contains a HindIII site (underlined). The indicated exonic information refers to the published NM_005270.3 GenBankTM sequence. The PCR products containing the unknown 5′ upstream region of GLI2 transcripts were digested with MluI/HindIII and inserted into the MluI/HindIII sites of pGL3-Basic for sequencing. Genomic DNA was extracted from HaCaT cells using a commercial kit (Qiagen). Various fragments of the human GLI2 promoter were amplified from genomic DNA, using BglII-containing forward primers and a HindIII-containing reverse primer. PCR products were subcloned into pGL3-Basic vector (Promega, Charbonnieres, France) and sequenced. The sequence of the constructs is identical to the sequence of human chromosome 2, GenbankTM NW_001838848.1. Site-directed mutagenesis to inactivate the SMAD and lymphoid enhancer factor/T cell factor (TCF/LEF) binding sites, respectively, at positions −33 and −60 of the promoter was carried out according to the DpnI-based QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis methodology (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the following primers: mutant SMAD site (mS) forward, 5′-GTGGCGGGAGGGTATGTGGGATTTCAGGTTTCAGG; mS reverse, 5′-CCTGAAACCTGAAATCCCACATACCCTCCCGCCAC; mutant TCF/LEF site (mT) forward, 5′-CTCGTTAGAGGAGGCCGAAGAAACCAGGTGGCGGG; mT reverse, 5′-CCCGCCACCTGGTTTCTTCGGCCTCCTCTAACGAG. Putative binding sites are shown in bold, and mutated bases are underlined. After amplification, promoter fragments were subcloned into the BglII/HindIII sites of pGL3-Basic. TS constructs containing 1 (TS), 2 (TS2), or 4 (TS4) concatamerized copies of the −66/−25 region of the human GLI2 promoter, were obtained by inserting the following double-stranded oligonucleotides into the pGL3-Basic XhoI site (italic): 5′-TCGAGGAGGAGTTCAAAGAAACCAGGTGGCGGGAGGGTGTCTGGGATC and its complementary strand: 5′-TCGAGATCCCAGACACCCTCCCGCCACCTGGTTTCTTTGAACTCCTCC. TmS4, in which the SMAD binding element (bold) is mutated to ATGT (bold underlined), was obtained by subcloning four copies of the following oligonucleotide: 5′-TCGAGGAGGAGTTCAAAGAAACCAGGTGGCGGGAGGGTATGTGGGATC and its complementary strand: 5′-TCGAGATCCCACATACCCTCCCGCCACCTGGTTTCTTTGAACTCCTCC. 24 h prior to transfection, HaCaT and HepG2 cells were plated in 24-well plates and transfected with siRNA (Ambion/Applied Biosystems) using HiPerfectTM (Qiagen) when indicated. The following day, cells at ∼40% confluency were transfected with 200 ng of firefly luciferase promoter reporter construct together with 15 ng of expression vector (when necessary) using JetPEI (PolyPlus Transfection, Strasbourg, France). 40 ng of phRL-MLP Renilla luciferase expression vector was co-transfected to estimate transfection efficiencies. phRL-MLP was generated by cloning the adenovirus major late promoter (MLP) upstream of the Renilla luciferase gene as a BgIII/HindIII insert within phRL-null (Promega). For each protocol, at least three independent experiments were performed. Sixteen h post-transfection, cells were serum-starved in 0.5% serum-containing medium and treated 8 h later with TGF-β1 for 16 h. Cells were lysed, and luciferase activity was determined with the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) using a Fluoroskan Ascent FL (Thermo LabSystems). In each experiment, promoter activity is expressed as the firefly/Renilla ratio relative to internal control conditions. Expression vectors for GLI2, SMAD3, TCF4, and constitutively active β-catenin (B23) have been described previously (20.Roessler E. Ermilov A.N. Grange D.K. Wang A. Grachtchouk M. Dlugosz A.A.

Equal amounts of protein were boiled with Laemmli buffer and subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature and incubated overnight at 4 °C with the primary antibody. After several washes, membranes were incubated in blocking buffer with a secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 2 h at room temperature. Antigen·antibody complexes were detected using ECLplus (Amersham Biosciences/GE Healthcare, Velizy, France) and revealed with a Storm PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences/GE Healthcare). Anti-Myc, anti-SMAD3, and anti-HSP60 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, whereas anti-β-catenin was from BD Biosciences. Anti-β-actin was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. HaCaT cells were grown to 60–70% confluency on 15-cm plates then serum-starved in 0.5% serum-containing medium for 16 h and stimulated with TGF-β for the indicated time. Chromatin immunoprecipitation was carried out using the ChIP-IT express kit (Active Motif, Rixensart, Belgium). Briefly, 4 μg of enzymatically sheared chromatin were immunoprecipitated using 4 μg of antibody against IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), SMAD3, or β-catenin overnight at 4 °C, then incubated for another 2 h at 4 °C with protein G beads. Precipitated DNA was used for PCR analysis using human GLI2 promoter-specific primers: forward, 5′-GAAGATCTCTGTGACTTTAATGCGGTGTG; reverse, 5′-TTGGGGAAGCTTCACCCTGAAACCTGAAATCCC. Amplimers were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis. Treatment of human immortalized HaCaT keratinocytes with TGF-β1 led to rapid elevation of GLI2 mRNA, peaking 4 h after TGF-β1 induction and remaining significantly higher than basal expression up to 8 h poststimulation (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained in the human hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2, in which basal levels of GLI2 transcripts are very low (see Fig. 2C). These data are consistent with our initial report (15.Dennler S. Andre J. Alexaki I. Li A. Magnaldo T. ten Dijke P. Wang X.J. Verrecchia F. Mauviel A. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 6981-6986Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). To determine whether TGF-β stabilizes GLI2 transcripts, GLI2 mRNA half-life was estimated in HaCaT cells using the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D. As shown in Fig. 1B, TGF-β1 did not modify the rate of GLI2 mRNA decay (half-life: 2.69 ± 0.02 versus 2.67 ± 0.02 h, respectively), suggesting that TGF-β-dependent elevation of GLI2 expression is not due to stabilization of GLI2 transcripts.FIGURE 2Characterization of the 5′ regulatory region of the human GLI2 gene.

Bai C.B. Joyner A.L. Wang B. Mol. Cell Biol. 2006; 26: 3365-3377Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar). In an attempt to determine whether TGF-β may also favor GLI2 protein accumulation, HaCaT cells were transfected with a Myc-tagged GLI2 expression vector (20.Roessler E. Ermilov A.N. Grange D.K. Wang A. Grachtchouk M. Dlugosz A.A. Muenke M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2005; 14: 2181-2188Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), and the stability of the expressed fusion protein was determined by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 1C, there was no detectable effect of TGF-β on Myc-GLI2 stability when protein neosynthesis was blocked by cycloheximide. It is thus likely that TGF-β exerts its effect on GLI2 expression primarily at the transcriptional level, although we cannot exclude a stabilization of endogenous GLI2 protein by TGF-β; its low abundance or our detection capability with currently available commercial antibodies did not allow us to determine its half-life (data not shown). As a first step toward cloning the human GLI2 gene promoter region, it was necessary to characterize the gene transcription start site(s). For this purpose, 5′-RACE by PCR followed by nested amplification with a primer localized on exon 1 according to the human GLI2 GenBankTM sequence NM_005270.3, was performed using total human RNA from HaCaT cells as a template (Fig. 2A). Sequencing of the ∼320-bp PCR product resulting from the 5′-RACE reaction identified a canonical initiator site (Fig. 2B): TCATTCT, with an adenosine as transcription start site. This initiator is located 85 bp upstream of the described exon 1 from GenBankTM sequence NM_005270.3. Initiator sites are normally associated with a downstream core promoter element (25.Smale S.T. Kadonaga J.T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 449-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (802) Google Scholar). Such sequence was found in position +35/+39 of the GLI2 promoter (see Fig. 2B). We were next able to PCR-amplify a ∼2-kb fragment containing 1,624 bp of the human GLI2 gene upstream of the initiator site (Fig. 2B), identical to a region of chromosome 2 located 5′ of the GLI2 coding sequence (GenbankTM MW_001838848.1). We failed to identify any canonical TATA box near the transcription start site. Yet, other features typical of a promoter were found, such as two potential CAAT boxes and numerous putative cis-acting elements upstream of the initiator element (for details, see supplemental Table 1), as determined using the MatInspectorTM software (Genomatix). To address the question of whether this 2-kb GLI2 genomic region exhibits transcriptional activity, the fragment was cloned upstream of the luciferase gene into pGL3-Basic to generate −1624pHGLI2luc. Parallel transient cell transfection experiments in HaCaT keratinocytes and HepG2 cells comparing the activity of −1624pHGLI2luc to that of pGL3-Basic identified robust transcriptional activity for this GLI2 genomic fragment in HaCaT cells (3-fold above pGL3-Basic activity), not in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2C, left panel), consistent with the subdetectable expression of GLI2 transcripts in the latter cell type as opposed to HaCaT cells (Fig. 2C, right panel). These data attest for a promoter function for this region of the GLI2 gene. A battery of deletion reporter constructs of the human GLI2 promoter was assessed for transcriptional activity in transient cell transfection experiments, in both HaCaT and HepG2 cells, treated or not with TGF-β. Consistent with the data obtained with −1624pHGLI2luc, all shorter constructs had clearly detectable basal transcriptional activity in HaCaT cells (2–3-fold above pGL3-luc activity) but were inactive in HepG2 cells (Fig. 2D). A stimulatory effect of TGF-β was observed with all constructs containing between 119 and 1305 bp of the promoter in both cell types, except for −1624pHGLI2luc, suggesting the existence of a potential repressor element within the −1624/−1305 region of the promoter. Whereas −119pHGLI2luc was efficiently transactivated in response to TGF-β, the −29-bp construct was not, thus identifying the 91-bp region between nucleotides −119 and −29 as required for activation by TGF-β1 (TGF-β-responsive unit; TβRU). Sequence examination identified putative LEF/TCF (5′-TTCAAAGA) and SMAD3/4 (5′-GTCT) binding elements (TBE and SBE, respectively) within this short fragment of the GLI2 promoter (Fig. 2E). We initially demonstrated that siRNA-mediated SMAD3 knockdown reduces TGF-β1-driven GLI2 expression (15.Dennler S. Andre J. Alexaki I. Li A. Magnaldo T. ten Dijke P. Wang X.J. Verrecchia F. Mauviel A. Cancer Res. 2007; 67: 6981-6986Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). In accordance with these findings, SMAD3 knockdown effectively prevented TGF-β1-induced GLI2 expression and −119pHGLI2luc transactivation in HaCaT (Fig. 3A) and HepG2 cells (data not shown). Conversely, overexpression of SMAD3 activated the proximal promoter, increased GLI2 expression, and enhanced TGF-β effect in both HaCaT and HepG2 cells (Fig. 3B). Gene transcription in response to β-catenin requires the association of nuclear β-catenin to transcription factors of the LEF/TCF family bound to cognate cis-elements (3.Hoppler S. Kavanagh C.L. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). It has been shown previously that TGF-β1 induces the accumulation of both cytoplasmic and nuclear β-catenin in HaCaT cells (26.Edlund S. Lee S.Y. Grimsby S. Zhang S. Aspenstrom P. Heldin C.H. Landstrom M. Mol. Cell Biol. 2005; 25: 1475-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Functional cooperation between SMAD and LEF/TCF transcription factors has been described to mediate TGF-β signaling and interactions with the Wnt pathway (27.Labbé E. Letamendia A. Attisano L. Proc.

Nature. 2000; 403: 781-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). We thus investigated a possible cooperation between β-catenin/TCF4 and SMAD3 to regulate GLI2 promoter activity. Firstly, we observed that coexpression of TCF4 with SMAD3 in HepG2 cells, in which the β-catenin pathway is constitutively activated (32.de La Coste A. Romagnolo B. Billuart P. Renard C.A. Buendia M.A. Soubrane O. Fabre M. Chelly J. Beldjord C. Kahn A. Perret C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 8847-8851Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar), resulted in synergistic transactivation of −119pHGLI2luc, indicative of efficient cooperation of these transcription factors to transactivate the GLI2 promoter (Fig. 3C, left panel). TCF4 was also found to enhance TGF-β-driven gene transcription. Secondly, TCF4 was ectopically expressed in HaCaT cells, without or with a constitutively active form of β-catenin, B23, known to interact with and favor the transcriptional activity of LEF/TCF transcription factors. TCF4 alone had a slight repressor effect on −119pHGLI2luc activity. Such a result is somewhat expected, given the low levels of active β-catenin in HaCaT cells as compared with HepG2 cells, which probably allows the formation of inhibitory TCF4 homodimers (3.Hoppler S. Kavanagh C.L. J. Cell Sci. 2007; 120: 385-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, overexpression of active β-catenin increased the basal activity and amplified the TGF-β response of −119pHGLI2luc and reversed the effect of TCF4 to that of a transcriptional activator (Fig. 3C, right panel). This experimental approach somewhat mimics the endogenous situation in HepG2 cells (that contain constitutively active β-catenin) and indicates a cooperation of SMAD3 with TCF4/β-catenin to drive GLI2 transcription. To validate the implication of β-catenin in TGF-β-driven GLI2 promoter transactivation in HepG2 cells, endogenous β-catenin expression was knocked down with specific siRNAs. Western analysis (Fig. 3D, left panel) revealed that siRNA treatment efficiently reduced the expression of both short (constitutively active) and long (wild-type) forms of β-catenin protein found in HepG2 cells (32.de La Coste A. Romagnolo B. Billuart P. Renard C.A. Buendia M.A. Soubrane O. Fabre M. Chelly J. Beldjord C. Kahn A. Perret C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 8847-8851Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we found that β-catenin siRNA largely abolished TGF-β effect on −119pHGLI2luc activity (Fig. 3D, right panel). These findings establish that the β-catenin pathway is involved in the regulation of GLI2 promoter activation by TGF-β in HepG2 cells. To determine whether the putative TBE and SBE cooperate and are sufficient to mediate a TGF-β-dependent transcriptional response, a short 42-bp sequence spanning both SBE and TBE sites was concatamerized upstream of a minimal promoter in MLP-luc, itself unresponsive to TGF-β (33.Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1581) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4A (left panel), TGF-β induced a robust transcriptional response of these constructs in HepG2 cells, proportional to the number of sequences inserted in the reporter vectors. Mutation of the SBE site within each monomer of the 4× construct (TmS4) abolished TGF-β responsiveness (Fig. 4A, right panel), indicating (a), that the SBE is critical for TGF-β response and (b), that the LEF/TCF site is not sufficient to drive TGF-β responsiveness in the context of a heterologous promoter. The dramatic induction of −119pHGLI2luc upon TCF4 expression led us to analyze sequences downstream of the TβRU. A putative LEF/TCF site (5′-ATCAAAGA) was found at position +236 within exon I. 3′-End deletion of −119pHGLI2luc was performed to generate −119/+104pHGLI2luc that contains no other SBE and TBE besides those found in the TβRU. Regulation of −119/+104pHGLI2luc by TGF-β and/or SMAD3 overexpression was similar to that of −119pHGLI2luc whereas its response to TCF4 and/or β-catenin overexpression was reduced (see below and compare with Fig. 3C). To determine the respective contribution of the putative SBE (5′-GTCT) and TBE (5′-TTCAAAGA) sites of the TβRU for GLI2 promoter responsiveness to TGF-β, GLI2 promoter/reporter constructs were generated in which the SBE or the TBE were mutated, either alone (mS and mT, respectively) or in combination (mTmS) within −119/+104pHGLI2luc. Both mutations efficiently prevent binding of their cogna"
https://openalex.org/W1984184017,"Although ubiquitously present in chromatin, the function of the linker histone subtypes is partly unknown and contradictory studies on their properties have been published. To explore whether the various H1 subtypes have a differential role in the organization and dynamics of chromatin we have incorporated all of the somatic human H1 subtypes into minichromosomes and compared their influence on nucleosome spacing, chromatin compaction and ATP-dependent remodeling. H1 subtypes exhibit different affinities for chromatin and different abilities to promote chromatin condensation, as studied with the Atomic Force Microscope. According to this criterion, H1 subtypes can be classified as weak condensers (H1.1 and H1.2), intermediate condensers (H1.3) and strong condensers (H1.0, H1.4, H1.5 and H1x). The variable C-terminal domain is required for nucleosome spacing by H1.4 and is likely responsible for the chromatin condensation properties of the various subtypes, as shown using chimeras between H1.4 and H1.2. In contrast to previous reports with isolated nucleosomes or linear nucleosomal arrays, linker histones at a ratio of one per nucleosome do not preclude remodeling of minichromosomes by yeast SWI/SNF or Drosophila NURF. We hypothesize that the linker histone subtypes are differential organizers of chromatin, rather than general repressors."
https://openalex.org/W2030828404,"Control over progenitor proliferation and neurogenesis remains a key challenge for stem cell neurobiology and a prerequisite for successful stem cell replacement therapies for neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we examined the function of two nuclear receptors, liver X receptors (Lxralpha and beta) and their ligands, oxysterols, as regulators of cell division, ventral midbrain (VM) neurogenesis, and dopaminergic (DA) neuron development. Deletion of Lxrs reduced cell cycle progression and VM neurogenesis, resulting in decreased DA neurons at birth. Activation of Lxrs with oxysterol ligands increased the number of DA neurons in mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and in wild-type but not Lxralphabeta(-/-) VM progenitor cultures. Likewise, oxysterol treatment of human ESCs (hESCs) during DA differentiation increased neurogenesis and the number of mature DA neurons, while reducing proliferating progenitors. Thus, Lxr ligands may improve current hESC replacement strategies for PD by selectively augmenting the generation of DA neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2142310815,"While religious faith remains one of the most significant features of human life, little is known about its relationship to ordinary belief at the level of the brain. Nor is it known whether religious believers and nonbelievers differ in how they evaluate statements of fact. Our lab previously has used functional neuroimaging to study belief as a general mode of cognition [1], and others have looked specifically at religious belief [2]. However, no research has compared these two states of mind directly.We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure signal changes in the brains of thirty subjects-fifteen committed Christians and fifteen nonbelievers-as they evaluated the truth and falsity of religious and nonreligious propositions. For both groups, and in both categories of stimuli, belief (judgments of ""true"" vs judgments of ""false"") was associated with greater signal in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, an area important for self-representation [3], [4], [5], [6], emotional associations [7], reward [8], [9], [10], and goal-driven behavior [11]. This region showed greater signal whether subjects believed statements about God, the Virgin Birth, etc. or statements about ordinary facts. A comparison of both stimulus categories suggests that religious thinking is more associated with brain regions that govern emotion, self-representation, and cognitive conflict, while thinking about ordinary facts is more reliant upon memory retrieval networks.While religious and nonreligious thinking differentially engage broad regions of the frontal, parietal, and medial temporal lobes, the difference between belief and disbelief appears to be content-independent. Our study compares religious thinking with ordinary cognition and, as such, constitutes a step toward developing a neuropsychology of religion. However, these findings may also further our understanding of how the brain accepts statements of all kinds to be valid descriptions of the world."

https://openalex.org/W2026733658,"The ASCE (additional strand, conserved E) superfamily of proteins consists of structurally similar ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities involving metabolism and transport of proteins and nucleic acids in all forms of life. A subset of these enzymes consists of multimeric ringed pumps responsible for DNA transport in processes including genome packaging in adenoviruses, herpesviruses, poxviruses and tailed bacteriophages. Although their mechanism of mechanochemical conversion is beginning to be understood, little is known about how these motors engage their nucleic acid substrates. Questions remain as to whether the motors contact a single DNA element, such as a phosphate or a base, or whether contacts are distributed over several parts of the DNA. Furthermore, the role of these contacts in the mechanochemical cycle is unknown. Here we use the genome packaging motor of the Bacillus subtilis bacteriophage varphi29 (ref. 4) to address these questions. The full mechanochemical cycle of the motor, in which the ATPase is a pentameric-ring of gene product 16 (gp16), involves two phases-an ATP-loading dwell followed by a translocation burst of four 2.5-base-pair (bp) steps triggered by hydrolysis product release. By challenging the motor with a variety of modified DNA substrates, we show that during the dwell phase important contacts are made with adjacent phosphates every 10-bp on the 5'-3' strand in the direction of packaging. As well as providing stable, long-lived contacts, these phosphate interactions also regulate the chemical cycle. In contrast, during the burst phase, we find that DNA translocation is driven against large forces by extensive contacts, some of which are not specific to the chemical moieties of DNA. Such promiscuous, nonspecific contacts may reflect common translocase-substrate interactions for both the nucleic acid and protein translocases of the ASCE superfamily."

To identify metabolic disturbances in β-cells that impair glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, we compared two INS-1-derived clonal β-cell lines, which are glucose-responsive (832/13 cells) or glucose-unresponsive (832/2 cells). To this end, we analyzed a number of parameters in glycolytic and mitochondrial metabolism, including mRNA expression of genes involved in cellular energy metabolism. We found that despite a marked impairment of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, 832/2 cells exhibited a higher rate of glycolysis. Still, no glucose-induced increases in respiratory rate, ATP production, or respiratory chain complex I, III, and IV activities were seen in the 832/2 cells. Instead, 832/2 cells, which expressed lactate dehydrogenase A, released lactate regardless of ambient glucose concentrations. In contrast, the glucose-responsive 832/13 line lacked lactate dehydrogenase and did not produce lactate. Accordingly, in 832/2 cells mRNA expression of genes for glycolytic enzymes were up-regulated, whereas mitochondria-related genes were down-regulated. This could account for a Warburg-like effect in the 832/2 cell clone, lacking in 832/13 cells as well as primary β-cells. In human islets, mRNA expression of genes such as lactate dehydrogenase A and hexokinase I correlated positively with HbA1c levels, reflecting perturbed long term glucose homeostasis, whereas that of Slc2a2 (glucose transporter 2) correlated negatively with HbA1c and thus better metabolic control. We conclude that tight metabolic regulation enhancing mitochondrial metabolism and restricting glycolysis in 832/13 cells is required for clonal β-cells to secrete insulin robustly in response to glucose.

https://openalex.org/W2063720739,"In Alzheimer's disease tauopathy is considered secondary to amyloid, and the duality obscures their relation and the definition of their respective contributions. Transgenic mouse models do not resolve this problem conclusively, i.e. the relative hierarchy of amyloid and tau pathology depends on the actual model and the genes expressed or inactivated. Here, we approached the problem in non-transgenic models by intracerebral injection of adeno-associated viral vectors to express protein tau or amyloid precursor protein in the hippocampus in vivo. AAV-APP mutant caused neuronal accumulation of amyloid peptides, and eventually amyloid plaques at 6 months post-injection, but with only marginal hippocampal cell-death. In contrast, AAV-Tau, either wild-type or mutant P301L, provoked dramatic degeneration of pyramidal neurons in CA1/2 and cortex within weeks. Tau-mediated neurodegeneration proceeded without formation of large fibrillar tau-aggregates or tangles, but with increased expression of cell-cycle markers. We present novel AAV-based models, which demonstrate that protein tau mediates pyramidal neurodegeneration in vivo. The data firmly support the unifying hypothesis that post-mitotic neurons are forced to re-enter the cell-cycle in primary and secondary tauopathies, including Alzheimer's disease."

However, the physics of melanin interaction with ionizing radiation is unknown.We rationally designed melanins from either 5-S-cysteinyl-DOPA, L-cysteine/L-DOPA, or L-DOPA with diverse structures as shown by elemental analysis and HPLC. Sulfur-containing melanins had higher predicted attenuation coefficients than non-sulfur-containing melanins. All synthetic melanins displayed strong electron paramagnetic resonance (2.14.10(18), 7.09.10(18), and 9.05.10(17) spins/g, respectively), with sulfur-containing melanins demonstrating more complex spectra and higher numbers of stable free radicals. There was no change in the quality or quantity of the stable free radicals after high-dose (30,000 cGy), high-energy ((137)Cs, 661.6 keV) irradiation, indicating a high degree of radical stability as well as a robust resistance to the ionizing effects of gamma irradiation. The rationally designed melanins protected mammalian cells against ionizing radiation of different energies.We propose that due to melanin's numerous aromatic oligomers containing multiple pi-electron system, a generated Compton recoil electron gradually loses energy while passing through the pigment, until its energy is sufficiently low that it can be trapped by stable free radicals present in the pigment. Controlled dissipation of high-energy recoil electrons by melanin prevents secondary ionizations and the generation of damaging free radical species."

The classification of breast tumors into distinct molecular subtypes by gene profiling and immunodetection of surrogate markers has proven useful for tumor prognosis and prediction of effective targeted treatments. The challenge now is to identify molecular biomarkers that may be of functional relevance for personalized therapy of breast tumors with poor outcome that do not respond to available treatments. The Mitochondrial Tumor Suppressor (MTUS1) gene is an interesting candidate whose expression is reduced in colon, pancreas, ovary and oral cancers. The present study investigates the expression and functional effects of MTUS1 gene products in breast cancer.By means of gene array analysis, real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, we show here that MTUS1/ATIP3 is significantly down-regulated in a series of 151 infiltrating breast cancer carcinomas as compared to normal breast tissue. Low levels of ATIP3 correlate with high grade of the tumor and the occurrence of distant metastasis. ATIP3 levels are also significantly reduced in triple negative (ER- PR- HER2-) breast carcinomas, a subgroup of highly proliferative tumors with poor outcome and no available targeted therapy. Functional studies indicate that silencing ATIP3 expression by siRNA increases breast cancer cell proliferation. Conversely, restoring endogenous levels of ATIP3 expression leads to reduced cancer cell proliferation, clonogenicity, anchorage-independent growth, and reduces the incidence and size of xenografts grown in vivo. We provide evidence that ATIP3 associates with the microtubule cytoskeleton and localizes at the centrosomes, mitotic spindle and intercellular bridge during cell division. Accordingly, live cell imaging indicates that ATIP3 expression alters the progression of cell division by promoting prolonged metaphase, thereby leading to a reduced number of cells ungergoing active mitosis.Our results identify for the first time ATIP3 as a novel microtubule-associated protein whose expression is significantly reduced in highly proliferative breast carcinomas of poor clinical outcome. ATIP3 re-expression limits tumor cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that this protein may represent a novel useful biomarker and an interesting candidate for future targeted therapies of aggressive breast cancer."

Telomere length is maintained primarily by telomerase, a multisubunit enzyme that synthesizes telomeres (1.Morin G.B. Cell. 1989; 59: 521-529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1356) Google Scholar).

Telomerase uses an RNA component (hTR (TERC)) as a template corresponding to the TTAGGG repeats (9.Feng J. Funk W.D. Wang S.S. Weinrich S.L. Avilion A.A. Chiu C.P. Adams R.R. Chang E. Allsopp R.C.

Telomerase is linked to cellular immortalization, a prerequisite for transformation. About 75% of human cancer cell lines express telomerase activity (11.Kim N.W. Piatyszek M.A. Prowse K.R.

The BRCA1 product is an 1863-amino acid nuclear phosphoprotein with a conserved N-terminal RING domain and an acidic C-terminal transcriptional activation domain (12.Miki Y. Swensen J.

The mechanisms by which BRCA1 suppresses tumorigenesis are not fully understood but may be due, in part, to its roles in DNA repair, cell cycle progression, and transcriptional regulation (14.Rosen E.M. Fan S. Pestell R.G. Goldberg I.D. J. Cell. Physiol. 2003; 196: 19-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 15.Rosen E.M. Fan S. Ma Y. Cancer. Lett. 2006; 236: 175-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Previously, we showed that BRCA1 regulates telomerase and telomere length (16.Xiong J. Fan S. Meng Q. Schramm L. Wang C. Bouzahza B. Zhou J. Zafonte B. Goldberg I.D. Haddad B.R. Pestell R.G. Rosen E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8668-8690Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Thus, BRCA1 overexpression inhibited hTERT expression and telomerase activity in human prostate and breast carcinoma cell lines. Inhibition of hTERT expression was due, in part, to inhibition of TERT promoter activity via the c-Myc E-box element. Furthermore, overexpression of BRCA1 (but not a tumor-associated point mutant BRCA1 protein) caused telomere shortening. Although wild-type BRCA1-transfected cell lines showed much shorter telomeres, these cells continued to proliferate and did not enter into senescence or apoptosis, suggesting that BRCA1 may contribute to telomere stabilization. Human breast (T47D, MCF-7) and prostate (DU-145) carcinoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum, non-essential amino acids (100 mm), l-glutamine (5 mm), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and penicillin (100 units/ml) (all from BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD), as described before (16.Xiong J.

Proliferating cells (at 20–30% confluence) were treated with a 100 nm concentration of the indicated siRNA for 72 h, using siPORT amine transfection reagent (Ambion, Foster City, CA). Knockdowns were confirmed by Western blotting. siRNAs used in this study were BRCA1 siRNA (two siRNAs custom synthesized by Dharmacon (Chicago, IL), CAGCUACCCUUCCAUCAUA and CUAGAAAUCUGUUGCUAUG (5′→3′)), BRCA1 control siRNA (D-001810-01 (Dharmacon)), TRF1 siRNA (sc-36722 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA)), TRF1 control siRNA (sc-37007 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), TRF2 siRNA (sc-38505 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.)), TRF2 control siRNA (sc-44230 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.)), TERT siRNA (sc-36641 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.)), and Rad50 siRNA (sc-37398 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.)).

Six μg of plasmid DNA was transfected per well in a 6-well plate utilizing Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen). Semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed as described earlier (16.Xiong J. Fan S. Meng Q. Schramm L. Wang C. Bouzahza B. Zhou J. Zafonte B. Goldberg I.D. Haddad B.R. Pestell R.G. Rosen E.M. Mol. Cell.

Aliquots (200 μg) of total RNA were reverse-transcribed using 50 units of Superscript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) in a 20-μl reaction volume. One μl of the transcribed cDNA was used for PCR amplification, using hot start Taq polymerase (Denville, South Plainfield, NJ). For each amplified product, the PCR conditions and cycle numbers were adjusted so that all reactions fell into the linear range of product amplification. The PCR primer sequences and predicted product sizes are listed in Table 1. PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis through 0.8% agarose gels containing 0.1 mg/ml ethidium bromide, and the gels were photographed under UV light. mRNA levels were quantified by densitometry of the cDNA bands and expressed relative to the control gene (β-actin).TABLE 1Primers used for RT-PCR in this studyGeneDirectionPrimer sequence (5′→3′)Annealing temperatureSize°CbpBRCA1ForwardTTGCGGGAGGAAAATGGGTAGTTA50292ReverseTGTGCCAAGGGTGAATGATGAAAGhTERTForwardCGGAAGAGTGTCTGGAGCAA52146ReverseGGATGAAGCGGAGTCTGGAhTRForwardGAAGGGCGTAGGCGCCGTGCTTTTGC55655ReverseGTTTGCTCTAGAATGAACGGTGGAAGGTRF1ForwardCTAAGGAGCAGATGGCAGAAAC54112ReverseGACTACGAGCTAAAGGAGACGTRF2ForwardTCAGACAGTCCGGGACATCAT54525ReverseCCTTCCTTCTATTTGTCGGTCGβ-ActinForwardAAATCTGGCACCACACCTTC49432ReverseCCATCTCTTGCTCGAAGTCCPOT1ForwardTCAGTCTGTTAAACTTCATTGCCC61614ReverseTGCACCATCCTGAAAAATTATATCC Open table in a new tab Telomerase activity was measured using the TRAPEZE-RT telomerase detection kit (Millipore, Bedford, MA). This assay quantifies telomerase activity by measuring real-time fluorescence emission using quantitative PCR. Briefly, after the indicated treatment, cells were lysed in 200 μl of CHAPS buffer. Aliquots of cell lysate (1 μg of protein/well) were assayed in a 96-well quantitative PCR plate. Wells were set aside for generation of the standard curve (TSR8 control template), negative control (no sample), and a PCR amplification efficiency control (TSK, K1). Telomerase activity (total product generated) was calculated by comparing the average Ct values from the sample wells against the standard curve generated by the TSR8 control template. Assays were performed on an ABI 7500 quantitative PCR machine (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Telomere length was determined by Southern blotting, using the TeloTAGG telomere length assay kit (Roche Applied Sciences). Aliquots of purified genomic DNA (2 μg) were digested by incubation with HinfI (20 MU) and RsaI (20 MU) for 2 h at 37 °C. The samples were separated by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose gel. Gels were transferred to a Brightstar Plus positively charged nylon membrane (Ambion) and cross-linked by UV light for 2 min. Membranes were incubated for 2 h in a prehybridization solution at 42 °C, hybridized for 3 h under similar conditions by the addition of 2 μl of digoxigenin-labeled telomere-specific probe, washed twice at 25 °C for 15 min in washing solution and twice at 50 °C in 0.5× washing solution for 20 min, and incubated with a digoxigenin-specific antibody coupled to alkaline phosphatase. The products were visualized using a chemiluminescent substrate (alkaline phosphatase metabolizing CDP-Star) and recorded on x-ray film. The mean telomere restriction fragment (TRF) length was calculated by densitometric segmenting of the output signal into grids and calculating the signal within each grid as a function of the corresponding molecular weight. TRF length was calculated based on three independent experiments per cell line. These assays are based on the ability of viable mitochondria to convert MTT, a soluble tetrazolium salt, into an insoluble formazan precipitate, which is dissolved in DMSO and quantified by spectrophotometry (18.Alley M.C. Scudiero D.A. Monks A. Hursey M.L. Czerwinski M.J. Fine D.L. Abbott B.J. Mayo J.G. Shoemaker R.H. Boyd M.R. Cancer. Res. 1988; 48: 589-601PubMed Google Scholar). Subconfluent proliferating cells were seeded into 96-well dishes (3000 cells/well) in growth medium, incubated for 24 h to allow attachment, and treated with adriamycin or cis-platinum (Sigma) as indicated. They were then postincubated for 24 h in fresh drug-free medium, after which cell viability was measured based on MTT dye conversion (absorbance difference at 570 and 630 nm) relative to sham-treated control cells. Cell viability was expressed as the mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments, each of which used 8 replicate wells/assay condition. Assays were carried out as described before (19.Loayza D. De Lange T. Nature. 2003; 423: 1013-1018Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar), using a ChIP-IT kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA). After the indicated cell treatments, formaldehyde was added to the culture medium to a final concentration of 1%. Fixation was carried out at 22 °C for 10 min and stopped by the addition of glycine (final concentration 0.125 m). The cells were collected by centrifugation, rinsed in PBS, resuspended in lysis buffer (ChIP-IT kit), incubated at 0 °C for 30 min, and homogenized at 0 °C to release the nuclei. The nuclei were pelleted by microcentrifuge (5000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C), resuspended in 1.0 ml of digestion buffer (ChIP-IT kit), incubated at 37 °C for 5 min, and then incubated with an enzymatic shearing mixture (200 units/ml) for 10 min to shear the chromatin to an average length of about 600 bp. The samples were incubated with EDTA (0.5 m) for 10 min at 0 °C and centrifuged (13,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C) to collect the sheared chromatin. Chromatin (6 μg unless otherwise specified) was incubated with the indicated antibody for 12–16 h at 4 °C. The Immunoprecipitation (IP) antibodies were BRCA1 (combination of Ab-1 plus Ab-2, Calbiochem); TRF1 (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); TRF2 (H-300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.); or normal mouse IgG, rabbit IgG, or goat IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Each IP used 5 μg of IgG. Incubations were carried out in ChIP Buffer 1 containing protease inhibitor mixture (ChIP-IT kit) along with protein-G magnetic beads. The beads were washed twice with ChIP Buffer 1 and ChIP Buffer 2 and collected via a magnetic stand. The chromatin was eluted using Elution Buffer AM2 (ChIP-IT kit), reverse cross-linked with Reverse Cross-linking Buffer (ChIP-IT kit), and incubated at 94 °C for 15 min. Samples were treated with Proteinase K (1 h at 25 °C) and Proteinase K stop solution (ChIP-IT kit). The remaining DNA was transferred to a Brightstar Plus positively charged nylon membrane via dot blotting and cross-linked via UV light for 2 min. Telomeric DNA was detected using the TeloTAGG telomere length assay kit (see above), quantified by densitometry, and expressed relative to the input signal as means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. Assays were performed as above except using a DNA probe (5′-CGGGAAGCAGAGGTTGTAGTGAGCC-3′) to the 3′-end of the Alu repeat element modified by the addition of a 3′-digoxigenin label (Integrated DNA Technologies, San Diego, CA). The Alu sequence (Alu-C) was derived from the highly diverged 3′-end of the Alu-type repeat, as described earlier (20.Weisberg T.F. Cahill B.K. Vary C.P. Mol. Cell. Probes. 1996; 10: 139-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Hybridization and detection of the DNA Alu probe (0.1 μg/ml) was performed using a DIG luminescence detection kit (Roche Applied Science). Subconfluent proliferating cells in 150-cm2 dishes were harvested, and whole cell extracts were prepared and subjected to IP as described before (21.Ma Y. Katiyar P. Jones L.P. Fan S. Zhang Y. Furth P.A. Rosen E.M. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 14-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Each IP was performed using 5 μg of antibody or antibody combination and 500 μg of cell protein. In some experiments, 500 μg of cell extract was incubated with 100 units/ml DNase I (Qiagen) at 37 °C for 30 min prior to IP. Precipitated proteins were collected using protein-G beads, washed, eluted in boiling Laemmli sample buffer, and subjected to Western blotting. The IP antibodies were BRCA1 (combination of mouse monoclonals Ab-1 plus Ab-2, Calbiochem), TRF1 (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), TRF2 (H-300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), Rad50 (sc-36641, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and normal (non-immune) IgG (mouse IgG, goat IgG, or rabbit IgG, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). In additional experiments to test if the association of TRF1 and BRCA1 required telomeric DNA, genomic DNA (5-μg aliquots) was prepared as above and incubated with Bal-31 (40 units/ml) (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) for 30 min at 30 °C for varying times, followed by inactivation in 20 mm of EDTA at 65 °C for 10 min. Bal-31 is an exonuclease that degrades both 3′ and 5′ termini of duplex DNA without generating internal cuts (22.Jiang L. Carter D.B. Xu J. Yang X. Prather R.S. Tian X.C. Biol. Reprod. 2004; 70: 1589-1593Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The Bal-31-digested DNA was then subjected to telomere length assays, as described above, to confirm digestion of chromosome ends. To test the effect of Bal-31 on BRCA1/TRF1 association, cell lysates were treated with Bal-31 for 120 min prior to IP-Western blotting. Western blotting was performed as described before (16.Xiong J. Fan S. Meng Q. Schramm L. Wang C. Bouzahza B. Zhou J. Zafonte B. Goldberg I.D. Haddad B.R. Pestell R.G. Rosen E.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 8668-8690Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Equal aliquots of total cell protein (50 μg) or the contents of an IP were electrophoresed on a 4–20% Tris-glycine gel and transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane (Millipore). The membrane was blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer (Sigma) and blotted using the desired primary antibody. The membranes were incubated with the appropriate species-specific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:10,000 dilution; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Blotted proteins were visualized using the ECL system (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Kaleidoscope prestained protein markers (Bio-Rad) were used as size standards. Primary antibodies were as follows (all from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.): BRCA1 (C-20, 1:200), Rad50 (sc-36641), TRF1 (C-19, 1:200), TRF2 (H-300, 1:200), hTERT (l-20, 1:200), and α-actin (I-19, 1:400). Cells cultured in 4-well culture slide chambers (BD Biosciences) were fixed for 8 min at 37 °C with 2.0% paraformaldehyde in fixation buffer (274 mm NaCl, 10 mm PIPES, 4 mm EGTA, 11 mm glucose). After three rinses with PBS, the cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 at 25 °C in fixation buffer for 20 min, washed three times with PBS, blocked with 10% donkey serum in PBS at 25 °C (90 min), incubated overnight with primary antibody at 4 °C, incubated with blocking solution at 37 °C for 20 min, rinsed, and incubated with secondary antibody. Cells were then washed twice with PBS, and coverslips were applied using Prolong Gold Anti-Fade plus DAPI mounting medium (Invitrogen). Primary antibodies were BRCA1 (Ab-1, Calbiochem), TRF1 (C-19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), and TRF2 (H-300, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). Secondary antibodies were donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 (green), donkey anti-goat IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (red), and donkey anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen). The stained cells were examined with an Olympus confocal laser fluorescence microscope with a ×60 objective (LSM 410, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) using simultaneous lasers with excitation wavelengths of 594 (red), 546 (Cy3), 488 (green), and 364 nm (DAPI). Detection was carried out using red and green narrow band filters. Images were collected every 2 μm in the vertical plane, overlaid to generate focus composite images, and stored as TIFF files. Quantitative colocalization analysis was performed using Metamorph version 6.2 software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Randomly chosen confocal images were analyzed to establish a positive threshold for each filter. The threshold for positive slides was adjusted to exclude obvious background or nonspecific staining. Green and red images were merged by the Metamorph colocalization module (23.Igbavboa U. Pidcock J.M. Johnson L.N. Malo T.M. Studniski A.E. Yu S. Sun G.Y. Wood W.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 17150-17157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Positive fluorescence (yellow) was collected as the number of pixels and automatically converted to percentage colocalization. Manual counting of colocalization was done on randomly chosen cells (n = 3) by counting yellow granules as a percentage of the total number of telomere granules (yellow plus red) in the same area. Values were expressed as the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. Combined telomere DNA staining (FISH probe) and immunostaining (BRCA1 or TRF1) was performed as described before (24.Meeker A.K. Gage W.R. Hicks J.L. Simon I. Coffman J.R. Platz E.A. March G.E. De Marzo A.M. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 160: 1259-1268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Cells cultured in 4-well Culture Slide Chambers (BD Biosciences) were fixed for 8 min at 37 °C with 2.0% paraformaldehyde and rinsed three times with PBS. Fixed samples were placed in deionized water followed by deionized water plus 0.2% Tween 20 (Sigma). Samples then underwent antigen retrieval in citrate buffer (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA), followed by a 5-min 95% ethanol treatment and air drying. Samples were hybridized with a Cy3-labeled telomere-specific peptide nucleic acid (PNA) probe with nucleotide sequence 5′-CCCTAACCCTAACCCTAA-3′ (Dako, Carpinteria, CA) (0.3 μg/ml PNA in 70% formamide, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5% blocking reagent). Slides were washed twice in PNA wash solution (70% formamide, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% albumin) (Sigma), washed three times in PBS plus Tween 20, blocked with 10% donkey serum in PBS at 25 °C for 90 min, incubated overnight with primary antibody at 4 °C, blocked at 37 °C for 20 min, rinsed, and incubated with secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor dye. Cells were then washed twice with PBS, and coverslips were applied as above. The primary and secondary antibodies were the same as above. Three independent experiments were performed per assay type per cell line. This assay uses an acridinium ester (AE)-labeled probe that is hybridized to the 3′ overhang (25.Tahara H. Kusunoki M. Yamanaka Y. Matsumura S. Ide T. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 829-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The mislabeled or unbound AE is inactivated by hydrolysis, but the hybridized AE probe is protected from hydrolysis and measured by chemiluminescence. Aliquots of genomic DNA (5 μg) were incubated with an AE-labeled telomere probe (5′-CCCTAACCCTAACC*CTAACCCTAACCCTA-3′, where the asterisk represents AE position) in hybridization buffer (0.1 m lithium succinate buffer, pH 4.7, containing 200 g/liter lithium lauryl sulfate, 1.2 m lithium chloride, 20 mm EDTA, 20 mm EGTA) at 60 °C for 20 min. AE labeling of telomere probe was performed by Integrated DNA Technologies. Hydrolysis of the unbound AE was carried out by incubation in hydrolysis buffer (0.6 m sodium tetraborate buffer, pH 8.5, containing 0.5% Triton X-100) at 60 °C for 10 min. After cooling at 0 °C for 1 min, luminescence was measured for 5 s with a luminometer and Gen-Probe detection reagent kit (Gen-Probe, Inc., San Diego, CA). The luminescence was normalized to AluDNA. To detect AluDNA, the Alu probe (5′-TGTAATCCCA*GCACTTTGGGAGGC-3′, where the asterisk represents AE position) was hybridized to genomic DNA (5 μg), as described before (25.Tahara H. Kusunoki M. Yamanaka Y. Matsumura S. Ide T. Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 829-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). As a negative control, genomic DNA was treated with Exo I (0.2 unit/μg DNA) (New England Biolabs) in exonuclease buffer (67 mm glycine-KOH, 6.7 mm MgCl2, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) at 37 °C for 2 h and heat-inactivated at 80 °C for 20 min before G-strands were assayed. Exo I removes nucleotides from single-stranded DNA in the 3′–5′ direction. G-strand overhang was also measured after incubation of genomic DNA with T7 exonuclease (1 unit/μg DNA) (New England Biolabs) in NE-Buffer 4 at 25 °C for 60 s. T7 exonuclease acts in the 5′–3′ direction to remove 5′ nucleotides from duplex DNA. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 20 mm EDTA at 65 °C for 10 min. This assay uses a nuclease (DSN) that digests double-stranded DNA while preserving single-stranded DNA (26.Zhao Y. Hoshiyama H. Shay J.W. Wright W.E. Nucleic Acids Res. 2008; 36: e14Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The G-strand overhang remains intact after incubation with DSN and is measured by hybridization to a C-rich digoxigenin-labeled probe and Southern blotting. Genomic DNA (5 μg) was digested with DSN (2 units/μg DNA) (Axxora, San Diego, CA) at 65 °C for 20 min. The digestion was stopped by adding 5 μl of 2× DSN stop solution as per the manufacturer's instructions. As a control, Exo I (0.2 units/μg DNA) was added to genomic DNA prior to DSN treatment and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h to digest 3′ overhangs. After an equal volume of formamide (Sigma) was added, samples were heated at 65 °C for 5 min, loaded on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea, and run in 0.5× Tris borate-EDTA (TBE) buffer. DNA was then transferred to a Brightstar positively charged membrane (Ambion) for 90 min in 0.5× TBE. The membrane was air-dried, UV-cross-linked and hybridized to a C-rich digoxigenin-labeled probe (CCCTAACCCTAACCCTAA) and processed using the TeloTAGG telomere length assay kit (Roche Applied Science).

https://openalex.org/W1992916600,"Background Despite modern technologies and novel computational approaches, decoding causal transcriptional regulation remains challenging. This is particularly true for less well studied organisms and when only gene expression data is available. In muscle a small number of well characterised transcription factors are proposed to regulate development. Therefore, muscle appears to be a tractable system for proposing new computational approaches. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we report a simple algorithm that asks “which transcriptional regulator has the highest average absolute co-expression correlation to the genes in a co-expression module?” It correctly infers a number of known causal regulators of fundamental biological processes, including cell cycle activity (E2F1), glycolysis (HLF), mitochondrial transcription (TFB2M), adipogenesis (PIAS1), neuronal development (TLX3), immune function (IRF1) and vasculogenesis (SOX17), within a skeletal muscle context. However, none of the canonical pro-myogenic transcription factors (MYOD1, MYOG, MYF5, MYF6 and MEF2C) were linked to muscle structural gene expression modules. Co-expression values were computed using developing bovine muscle from 60 days post conception (early foetal) to 30 months post natal (adulthood) for two breeds of cattle, in addition to a nutritional comparison with a third breed. A number of transcriptional landscapes were constructed and integrated into an always correlated landscape. One notable feature was a ‘metabolic axis’ formed from glycolysis genes at one end, nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein genes at the other, and centrally tethered by mitochondrially-encoded mitochondrial protein genes. Conclusions/Significance The new module-to-regulator algorithm complements our recently described Regulatory Impact Factor analysis. Together with a simple examination of a co-expression module's contents, these three gene expression approaches are starting to illuminate the in vivo transcriptional regulation of skeletal muscle development."
https://openalex.org/W2017958331,"Background During the Ordovician the global diversity increased dramatically at family, genus and species levels. Partially the diversification is explained by an increased nutrient, and phytoplankton availability in the open water. Cephalopods are among the top predators of todays open oceans. Their Ordovician occurrences, diversity evolution and abundance pattern potentially provides information on the evolution of the pelagic food chain. Methodology/Principal Findings We reconstructed the cephalopod departure from originally exclusively neritic habitats into the pelagic zone by the compilation of occurrence data in offshore paleoenvironments from the Paleobiology Database, and from own data, by evidence of the functional morphology, and the taphonomy of selected cephalopod faunas. The occurrence data show, that cephalopod associations in offshore depositional settings and black shales are characterized by a specific composition, often dominated by orthocerids and lituitids. The siphuncle and conch form of these cephalopods indicate a dominant lifestyle as pelagic, vertical migrants. The frequency distribution of conch sizes and the pattern of epibionts indicate an autochthonous origin of the majority of orthocerid and lituitid shells. The consistent concentration of these cephalopods in deep subtidal sediments, starting from the middle Tremadocian indicates the occupation of the pelagic zone early in the Early Ordovician and a subsequent diversification which peaked during the Darriwilian. Conclusions/Significance The exploitation of the pelagic realm started synchronously in several independent invertebrate clades during the latest Cambrian to Middle Ordovician. The initial rise and diversification of pelagic cephalopods during the Early and Middle Ordovician indicates the establishment of a pelagic food chain sustainable enough for the development of a diverse fauna of large predators. The earliest pelagic cephalopods were slowly swimming vertical migrants. The appearance and early diversification of pelagic cephalopods is interpreted as a consequence of the increased food availability in the open water since the latest Cambrian."
https://openalex.org/W2057806477,"A 20-year seismological record of from the Parkfield area of the San Andreas fault has been used to identify two occasions when long-term changes in fault strength seem to have been induced remotely by large seismic events — the 2004 Sumatra–Andaman and the 1992 Landers earthquakes. In both cases, two changes occurred that are consistent with variations in fault strength: variation in the properties of seismic scatterers with time (reflecting stress-induced migration of fluids) and systematic variation in the characteristics of repeating-earthquake sequences. These findings suggest that the largest earthquakes have a global influence on the strength of the Earth's fault systems. In support of that hypothesis, an unusually large number of M ≥ 8 earthquakes occurred in the three years following the 2004 Sumatra–Andaman earthquake. Changes in fault strength over time can increase or decrease the likelihood of failure and the ultimate triggering of seismic events. Observation of the Parkfield area at the San Andreas fault over the years 1987–2008 now reveals two occasions — the 2004 Sumatra–Andaman earthquake and the 1992 Landers earthquake — where long-term changes in fault strength have probably been induced remotely by large seismic events. Fault strength is a fundamental property of seismogenic zones, and its temporal changes can increase or decrease the likelihood of failure and the ultimate triggering of seismic events. Although changes in fault strength have been suggested to explain various phenomena, such as the remote triggering of seismicity1, there has been no means of actually monitoring this important property in situ. Here we argue that ∼20 years of observation (1987–2008) of the Parkfield area at the San Andreas fault have revealed a means of monitoring fault strength. We have identified two occasions where long-term changes in fault strength have been most probably induced remotely by large seismic events, namely the 2004 magnitude (M) 9.1 Sumatra–Andaman earthquake and the earlier 1992 M = 7.3 Landers earthquake. In both cases, the change possessed two manifestations: temporal variations in the properties of seismic scatterers—probably reflecting the stress-induced migration of fluids—and systematic temporal variations in the characteristics of repeating-earthquake sequences that are most consistent with changes in fault strength. In the case of the 1992 Landers earthquake, a period of reduced strength probably triggered the 1993 Parkfield aseismic transient2,3,4,5 as well as the accompanying cluster of four M > 4 earthquakes at Parkfield. The fault-strength changes produced by the distant 2004 Sumatra–Andaman earthquake are especially important, as they suggest that the very largest earthquakes may have a global influence on the strength of the Earth’s fault systems. As such a perturbation would bring many fault zones closer to failure, it should lead to temporal clustering of global seismicity. This hypothesis seems to be supported by the unusually high number of M ≥ 8 earthquakes occurring in the few years following the 2004 Sumatra–Andaman earthquake."
https://openalex.org/W2071244327,"Dual-specific A-kinase-anchoring protein 2 (D-AKAP2/AKAP10), which interacts at its carboxyl terminus with protein kinase A and PDZ domain proteins, contains two tandem regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) domains for which the binding partners have remained unknown. We show here that these RGS domains interact with Rab11 and GTP-bound Rab4, the first demonstration of RGS domains binding small GTPases. Rab4 and Rab11 help regulate membrane trafficking through the endocytic recycling pathways by recruiting effector proteins to specific membrane domains. Although D-AKAP2 is primarily cytosolic in HeLa cells, a fraction of the protein localizes to endosomes and can be recruited there to a greater extent by overexpression of Rab4 or Rab11. D-AKAP2 also regulates the morphology of the Rab11-containing compartment, with co-expression causing accumulation of both proteins on enlarged endosomes. Knockdown of D-AKAP2 by RNA interference caused a redistribution of both Rab11 and the constitutively recycling transferrin receptor to the periphery of cells. Knockdown also caused an increase in the rate of transferrin recycling, suggesting that D-AKAP2 promotes accumulation of recycling proteins in the Rab4/Rab11-positive endocytic recycling compartment."
https://openalex.org/W2032686518,"Glutamate decarboxylase (GadB) from Escherichia coli is a hexameric, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent enzyme catalyzing CO(2) release from the alpha-carboxyl group of L-glutamate to yield gamma-aminobutyrate. GadB exhibits an acidic pH optimum and undergoes a spectroscopically detectable and strongly cooperative pH-dependent conformational change involving at least six protons. Crystallographic studies showed that at mildly alkaline pH GadB is inactive because all active sites are locked by the C termini and that the 340 nm absorbance is an aldamine formed by the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-Lys(276) Schiff base with the distal nitrogen of His(465), the penultimate residue in the GadB sequence. Herein we show that His(465) has a massive influence on the equilibrium between active and inactive forms, the former being favored when this residue is absent. His(465) contributes with n approximately 2.5 to the overall cooperativity of the system. The residual cooperativity (n approximately 3) is associated with the conformational changes still occurring at the N-terminal ends regardless of the mutation. His(465), dispensable for the cooperativity that affects enzyme activity, is essential to include the conformational change of the N termini into the cooperativity of the whole system. In the absence of His(465), a 330-nm absorbing species appears, with fluorescence emission spectra more complex than model compounds and consisting of two maxima at 390 and 510 nm. Because His(465) mutants are active at pH well above 5.7, they appear to be suitable for biotechnological applications."
https://openalex.org/W1997627309,"Gene duplication is thought to provide raw material for functional divergence and innovation. Fish-specific dmrt2b has been identified as a duplicated gene of the dmrt2a/terra in fish genomes, but its function has remained unclear. Here we reveal that Dmrt2b knockdown zebrafish embryos display a downward tail curvature and have U-shaped somites. Then, we demonstrate that Dmrt2b contributes to a divergent function in somitogenesis through Hedgehog pathway, because Dmrt2b knockdown reduces target gene expression of Hedgehog signaling, and also impairs slow muscle development and neural tube patterning through Hedgehog signaling. Moreover, the Dmrt2b morphants display defects in heart and visceral organ asymmetry, and, some lateral-plate mesoderm (LPM) markers expressed in left side are randomized. Together, these data indicate that fish-specific duplicated dmrt2b contributes to a divergent function in somitogenesis through Hedgehog pathway and maintains the common function for left-right asymmetry establishment."
https://openalex.org/W2041121696,"The clustered protocadherin-alpha (Pcdha) genes, which are expressed in the vertebrate brain, encode diverse membrane proteins whose functions are involved in axonal projection and in learning and memory. The Pcdha cluster consists of 14 tandemly arranged genes (Pcdha1-Pcdha12, Pcdhac1, and Pcdhac2, from 5' to 3'). Each first exon (the variable exons) is transcribed from its own promoter, and spliced to the constant exons, which are common to all the Pcdha genes. Cerebellar Purkinje cells show dual expression patterns for Pcdha. In individual Purkinje cells, different sets of the 5' genes in the cluster, Pcdha1-12, are randomly expressed, whereas both 3' genes, Pcdhac1 and Pcdhac2, are expressed constitutively. To elucidate the relationship between the genomic structure of the Pcdha cluster and their expression in Purkinje cells, we deleted or duplicated multiple variable exons and analyzed the expression of Pcdha genes in the mouse brain. In all mutant mice, transcript levels of the constant exons and the dual expression patterns were maintained. In the deletion mutants, the missing genes were flexibly compensated by the remaining variable exons. On the other hand, in duplication mutants, the levels of the duplicated genes were trimmed. These results indicate that the Pcdha genes are comprehensively regulated as a cluster unit, and that the regulators that randomly and constitutively drive Pcdha gene expression are intact in the deleted or duplicated mutant alleles. These dual regulatory mechanisms may play important roles in the diversity and fundamental functions of neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2110137189,"Introduction Malaria continues to be one of the major public health problems in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Artemisinin derivatives (ARTs; artesunate, artemether, and dihydroartemisinin) derived from the herb, Artemisia annua, are the most effective antimalarial drugs available providing rapid cures. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has recommended that all antimalarials must be combined with an artemisinin component (artemisinin-based combination therapy; ACT) for use as first line treatment against malaria. This class of drugs is now first-line policy in most malaria-endemic countries. Reports of ad hoc surveys from South East Asia show that up to 50% of the artesunate currently sold is counterfeit. Drug quality is rarely assessed in resource poor countries in part due to lack of dedicated laboratory facilities which are expensive to build, equip and maintain. With a view to address this unmet need we developed two novel colour reaction assays that can be used in the field to check the quality of ARTs. Methods and Findings Our assays utilise thin layer chromatography silica gel sheets and 2, 4 dinitrophenylhydrazine or 4-Benzoylamino-2, 5-dimethoxybenzenediazonium chloride hemi (zinc chloride) salt as the reagents showing a pink or blue product respectively only in the presence ARTs. We are able to detect as low as 10% of ARTs in ACTs (WINTHROP - artesunate/amodiaquine, Coartem®-artemether/lumefantrine and Duocortexcin - dihydroartemisinin/piperaquine). The assays have been validated extensively by testing eighty readily accessible and widely used drugs in malaria endemic countries. None of the other antimalarial drugs or a range of commonly used excipients, antiretroviral drugs or other frequently used drugs from the WHO essential drugs list such as analgesics or antibiotics are detected with our assays. Conclusions Our two independent assays requiring no specialist training are specific, simple to use, rapid, robust, reproducible, inexpensive and, have successfully resulted in detecting two counterfeit drugs within a small scale screening survey of over 100 declared artemisinin-containing drugs collected from various Asian and African countries. These promising results indicate that the assays will provide a useful first test to assure the quality of the ACTs formulations in resource poor malaria endemic areas when there is an absence of dedicated medicines quality laboratory facilities."
https://openalex.org/W1983043887,"Serum response factor (SRF) is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that binds a 10-bp element known as the CArG box, located in the proximal regulatory region of hundreds of target genes. SRF activates target genes in a cell- and context-dependent manner by assembling unique combinations of cofactors over CArG elements. One particularly strong SRF cofactor, myocardin (MYOCD), acts as a component of a molecular switch for smooth muscle cell (SMC) differentiation by activating cytoskeletal and contractile genes harboring SRF-binding CArG elements. Here we report that the human ACTG2 promoter, containing four conserved CArG elements, displays SMC-specific basal activity and is highly induced in the presence of MYOCD. Stable transfection of a non-SMC cell type with Myocd elicits elevations in endogenous Actg2 mRNA. Gel shift and luciferase assays reveal a strong bias for MYOCD-dependent transactivation through CArG2 of the human ACTG2 promoter.

Co-immunoprecipitation, glutathione S-transferase pulldown, and luciferase assays show a physical and functional association between MYOCD and NKX3.1; no such functional relationship is evident with the related NKX2.5 transcription factor despite its interaction with MYOCD.

Kumar M.S. Wamhoff B.R. Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 767-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2621) Google Scholar). Many SMC differentiation genes contain proximal cis regulatory elements, called CArG boxes, which bind the broadly expressed transcription factor, serum response factor (SRF) (2.Miano J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2003; 35: 577-593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). SRF is a weak activator of gene expression, requiring physical interactions among over 60 cofactors that themselves recruit additional proteins to fully direct unique patterns of gene expression. The discovery of one such SRF cofactor, called myocardin (MYOCD), has revolutionized our understanding of the basic transcriptional mechanisms underlying the specification of a differentiated SMC phenotype (3.Wang D.

Myocd mRNA is restricted mainly to cardiac and SMC and its encoded protein is one of nature's most powerful transactivators of gene expression (3.Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L.

Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), although the level of SMC gene activation appears to be both cell and promoter context-dependent (4.Chen J. Kitchen C.M. Streb J.W. Miano J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1345-1356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). MYOCD elicits structural and functional attributes of SMC suggesting this cofactor has characteristics of a master regulator of the differentiated SMC phenotype (5.Long X. Bell R.D. Gerthoffer W.T.

In theory, SRF binds up to 1,216 permutations of the CArG box (8.Miano J.M. Long X. Fujiwara K. Am. J. Physiol.

U.S.A. 2003; 100: 7129-7134Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) proposed a model wherein MYOCD forms a molecular bridge over two or more CArG boxes by undergoing homo-oligomerization through its leucine zipper-like domain thus maximizing transactivation of SMC contractile genes harboring more than one CArG element. According to this model, SMC cytoskeletal/contractile genes with one CArG box will only be activated moderately by MYOCD. On the other hand, several multi-CArG containing genes are refractory to high level MYOCD-dependent transactivation, which likely is attributable to sequences immediately flanking CArG elements (3.Wang D.

Thus, the number of CArG boxes, the sequence character therein, and flanking sequences appear to be key determinants of MYOCD-mediated transcriptional activity. SMC are often defined structurally and physiologically as vascular or visceral SMC. Although expressing comparable levels of many cytoskeletal/contractile genes, microarray data indicate unique gene expression signatures between both SMC types (17.Chi J.T. Rodriguez E.H. Wang Z.

For example, the SRF- and MYOCD-dependent telokin gene is abundantly expressed in visceral SMC with low-level expression in vascular SMC (18.Gallagher P.J. Herring B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23945-23952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, a chimeric promoter of telokin harboring a fragment of the Tagln promoter confers vascular activity in transgenic mice suggesting that SMC promoters harbor important sequence content for vascular versus visceral SMC expression (19.Hoggatt A.M. Simon G.M. Herring B.P. Circ. Res. 2002; 91: 1151-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Two smoothelin isoforms exhibit SMC type-restricted expression in adults with smoothelin A expressed predominantly in visceral SMC and smoothelin B in vascular SMC (20.van Eys G.J. Niessen P.M. Rensen S.S. Trends Cardiovasc. Med. 2007; 17: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Smoothelin A contains conserved CArG elements that are mildly responsive to MYOCD, whereas smoothelin B, without conserved CArG boxes, is refractory to MYOCD transactivation in vitro (15.Rensen S.S. Niessen P.M. Long X. Doevendans P.A. Miano J.M. van Eys G.J. Cardiovasc. Res. 2006; 70: 136-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The murine smooth muscle γ-actin gene (Actg2) is expressed abundantly in visceral SMC with lower levels in vascular SMC (21.McHugh K.M. Crawford K. Lessard J.L. Dev. Biol. 1991; 148: 442-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Transgenic mice carrying 13.7 kb of 5′ promoter and 3′ intronic mouse Actg2 sequences similarly exhibit visceral SMC activity (22.Qian J. Kumar A. Szucsik J.C. Lessard J.L. Dev. Dyn. 1996; 207: 135-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In this report, we have revisited expression of Actg2 in vascular SMC and evaluated the role of MYOCD in regulating human ACTG2 promoter activity in vitro. Results demonstrate Actg2 mRNA and protein expression as well as specific promoter activity in vascular SMC. Despite the presence of four closely juxtaposed CArG boxes in the 5′ proximal region of ACTG2, MYOCD appears to preferentially utilize a single CArG element (CArG2) that confers high-level promoter activity through elevations in SRF-MYOCD binding. Importantly, an adjacent binding site for NKX3.1 is necessary for full transactivation, and co-transfection reporter assays of MYOCD show NKX3.1 potentiates MYOCD-dependent stimulation of the human ACTG2 promoter. Co-immunoprecipitation, GST pulldown, and luciferase reporter assays suggest this activity occurs through physical contacts between the C-terminal domain of MYOCD and NKX3.1. These results reveal a CArG bias for MYOCD transactivation of Actg2 gene transcription and suggest this discrimination stems from the novel interaction of MYOCD with the NKX3.1 homeodomain protein. Primary-derived rat aortic smooth muscle cells and the PAC-1 and A7r5 SMC lines, as well as NIH 3T3, CV-1, COS-7, HeLa, BC3H1, L6 myoblasts, and a human uterine SMC line (SKLMS, ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing high glucose, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 200 μm l-glutamine. Cells were cultured in the absence of antibiotics and antimycotics and used for transfections or RNA/protein analysis when 70–90% confluent. The same medium conditions were used for prostate stromal and epithelial cells as well as LNCaP and PC3 prostate cell lines. In some experiments the androgen, methyltrienolone (R1881, PerkinElmer Life Sciences), was used at 1 or 10 nm (see below). For L6 stable cell lines carrying myocardin (4.Chen J. Kitchen C.M. Streb J.W. Miano J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1345-1356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), cells were cultured in the presence of 900 μg/ml G418. Serial deletions of the human ACTG2 promoter (285, 205, 95, and 55 nucleotides from the annotated transcriptional start site) were cloned into pGL3 basic (Promega, Madison, WI) for firefly luciferase reporter assays (below). Mutations were introduced into each of the four CArG regulatory elements (CArG1, CArG2, CArG3, and CArG4) and NKX-binding element (NKE) of the human ACTG2 promoter using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) and verified by DNA sequencing (Cornell Sequencing Core). The ACTG2 CArG4 sequence was mutated from the wild type element 5′-gcttataagg-3′ to 5′-gtctataagg-3′, the CArG3 sequence from 5-gcataaaagg-3′ to 5-gtctaaaagg-3′, the CArG2 sequence from 5′-ccttatatgg-3′ to 5′-gtctatagg-3′, the CArG1 sequence from 5′-cctttttagg-3′ to 5-gtcttttagg-3′, and the NKE sequence from 5-cgtcagctgg-3′ to 5′-cgtcagcccc-3′. The CArG1, -2, -3, -4, CArG1, -3, -4, and CArG2 mutants contained the same respective mutations as above. Plasmids pcDNA3. 1-FLAG-MYOCD and pcDNA3.1-FLAG-MYOCD-ΔCT were used as previously described (3.Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N.

Adenoviral-mediated short hairpin RNA knockdown of SRF was done in BC3H1 cells using 25 multiplicity of infection of short hairpin SRF or short hairpin enhanced green fluorescent protein control and levels of the Actg2 transcript were measured with the above primers. PCR products were resolved in a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The calcium phosphate co-precipitation method was used for transient transfections as described (25.Graham F.L. van der Eb A.J.

Except where indicated, cells were co-transfected with 0.5 μg of ACTG2 promoter linked to firefly luciferase and either 0.5 μg of empty vector (pcDNA3.1 or pCGN) or an equal molar quantity of the same vector carrying various forms of MYOCD, NKX3.1, NKX2.5, or SRF-VP16. Fifty nanograms of the internal Renilla reporter gene (Promega) were used in all samples to normalize luciferase activity. The following day (12–16 h post-transfection), cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and refed fresh growth medium for an additional 24 h. Cells were then lysed with 200 μl of 1× Passive lysis buffer (Promega) and 20 μl of cell lysate was processed for Dual Luciferase Assay according to the manufacturer's manual (Promega). Bioluminescence was measured over 10 s with an AutoLumat LB 953 luminometer (EG&G Berthold, Gaithersburg, MD). All transfections were performed in quadruplicate in at least two independent experiments and expressed as the normalized (luciferase to Renilla) fold-change over baseline (−55 ACTG2, see Fig. 2B, and −55 ACTG2 absent MYOCD in see Fig. 3), percent change under −285 ACTG2 (see Fig. 5), or fold-increase over pcDNA3.1 or pcGN control vectors (see Fig. 6).FIGURE 3MYOCD-dependent stimulation of ACTG2 promoter and endogenous mRNA.

Under these conditions (>1:500 antibody dilution) we and others have shown that the monoclonal antibody clone B4 used in this study is highly selective for the smooth muscle γ-actin isoform, ACTG2 (48.Kovacs A.M.

Interactions between NKX3.1 and MYOCD were examined by co-immunoprecipitation following co-transfection with FLAG-tagged MYOCD and HA-tagged NKX3.1. Transfected cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 200 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation (5 min at 14,000 rpm), followed by incubation with anti-FLAG antibodies conjugated to agarose beads (M2, Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, the immune complexes were eluted by boiling in Laemmli buffer for 5 min and subjected to polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by electrotransfer to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore). The proteins on the membrane were then analyzed by Western blotting with anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Calbiochem), and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce). The [35S]methionine-labeled in vitro translated myocardin probe was generated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, WI), following the manufacturer's protocol. The [35S]MYOCD probe was incubated with purified GST-NKX3.1 or GST alone (bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads) for 3 h at 4 °C in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 75 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm dithiothreitol. The resin was subsequently washed four times with 1 ml of the binding buffer, and then boiled in Laemmli sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The proteins on the membrane were stained with Amido Black, and the [35S]MYOCD was detected by autoradiography. To examine SRF-MYOCD binding to CArG boxes in the human ACTG2 promoter, the following oligonucleotides (CArG and NKE sites underlined, mutant bases in lowercase) and their respective complement (not shown) were heated at 65 °C for 10 min and annealed prior to end labeling with [γ-32P]dATP as described (27.Miano J.M.

The wild type ACTG2 −205 promoter fragment containing CArG1, NKE, and CArG2 was end-labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs). SRF and MYOCD were in vitro translated by the TnT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate system (Promega). Endogenously expressing MYOCD was from lysates of L6 cell lines stably transfected with MYOCD (4.Chen J. Kitchen C.M. Streb J.W. Miano J.M. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2002; 34: 1345-1356Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Samples were resolved on a 5% polyacrylamide gel using indicated competitors and antibodies essentially as described (27.Miano J.M. Carlson M.J. Spencer J.A. Misra R.P. J. Biol.

Comparative sequence analysis of the human ACTG2 genetic locus with orthologs in chimp (Pan troglodytes, Ptr), dog (Canis familiaris, Cfa), mouse (Mus musculus, Mmu), and chicken (Gallus gallus, Gga) was done with the VISTA Gene Alignment tool (28.Mayor C. Brudno M. Schwartz J.R. Poliakov A. Rubin E.M. Frazer K.A. Pachter L.S. Dubchak I. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 1046-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (798) Google Scholar). Sequence logos representing position weight matrices of orthologous CArG and NKE elements of the ACTG2 promoter from the same species as those used in the VISTA analysis were generated with WebLogo (29.Crooks G.E. Hon G. Chandonia J.M. Brenner S.E. Genome Res. 2004; 14: 1188-1190Crossref PubMed Scopus (8449) Google Scholar). Simple protocols for performing these analyses are available upon request. Actg2 mRNA is abundantly expressed in aorta, bladder, and cultured SMC with less expression in other tissues and cell lines (Fig. 1A). In contrast, Acta2 mRNA is more broadly expressed. Interestingly, we observe differential splicing of Srf mRNA in aorta and bladder (primarily full-length) versus other tissues and cultured SMC (full-length plus δ5 splice variant, Fig. 1A); the molecular basis for this differential splicing phenomenon is presently unknown. As expected, Nkx2.5 mRNA is restricted to heart but detectable transcripts are also seen in the A7r5 SMC line (Fig. 1A). Expression of the related Nkx3.1 mRNA is only seen in L6 myoblasts and A7r5 SMC (the latter cells only show detectable Nkx3.1 transcripts after two sequential rounds of PCR). Actg2 and Nkx3.1 mRNA are present in prostate cell lines (39.Schneider A. Brand T. Zweigerdt R. Arnold H.H. Mech. Dev. 2000; 95: 163-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To see whether Myocd is similarly co-expressed with these transcripts, we measured mRNA levels in several distinct human prostate cell lines in the absence or presence of androgen. Results reveal detectable transcripts to Myocd in each cell line (Fig. 1B). Moreover, Myocd is co-expressed with Actg2 and Nkx3.1 mRNA in mouse prostate tissue (Fig. 1C). To determine whether expression of the ACTG2 protein coincides with its mRNA expression in vascular SMC, we performed immunohistochemistry with an ACTG2-selective antibody on sections of rat heart and aorta. Levels of ACTG2 protein are present in coronary artery, aortic and microvascular SMC (Fig. 1D, d, e, and f, respectively), but not cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1D, d) or perivascular tissue (Fig. 1D, f). Together, the expression data establish mRNA and protein expression of SM γ-actin (Actg2) in distinct vascular SMC types and the co-expression of Myocd, Nkx3.1, and Actg2 mRNA in prostate tissue/cell lines. Comparative genomics between human (Hsa) and chimp (Ptr), dog (Cfa), mouse (Mmu), and chicken (Gga) reveals high sequence conservation in the immediate 5′ promoter region of ACTG2 where 4 conserved CArG elements and a binding element for NK factors (NKE) reside over ∼200 bp of genomic DNA (Fig. 2, A and B). The presence of CArG1 and NKE elements mediates mild basal promoter activity in several SMC lines from human and rat (−95 in Fig. 2C). Inclusion of CArG2 dramatically elevates basal human ACTG2 promoter activity in a SMC-specific manner (−205 in Fig. 2C). The addition of CArG3 and CArG4 has no further stimulatory effect on ACTG2 promoter activity in SMC (−285 in Fig. 2C). To determine the relative effects of MYOCD on each ACTG2 promoter construct, transient co-transfections were performed in COS7 and the rat pulmonary artery PAC1 SMC line using the 807-amino acid form of MYOCD (3.Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3, A and B). In both COS7 and PAC1 SMC, MYOCD is unable to stimulate increases in the ACTG2 −55 promoter construct above baseline levels and only mildly stimulates −95 ACTG2. However, addition of CArG2 (−205) results in 100-fold increases in ACTG2 promoter activity in COS7 cells (Fig. 3A). Less apparent induction is seen with −205 ACTG2 in PAC1 SMC due to the higher basal activity of the −205 reporter (Fig. 3B). Similar to data in Fig. 2C, the presence of CArG3 and CArG4 (−285) confers no further MYOCD-dependent transactivation of ACTG2 promoter activity (Fig. 3, A and B). Consistent with previous data using other CArG-dependent promoters (3.Wang D. Chang P.S. Wang Z. Sutherland L. Richardson J.A. Small E. Krieg P.A. Olson E.N. Cell. 2001; 105: 851-862Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar), the basic and C-terminal transactivation domain of MYOCD are essential"
https://openalex.org/W2083654006,"The ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation pathway is increasingly being recognized as important in regulation of protein turnover in eukaryotic cells. One substrate of this pathway is the pyrimidine biosynthetic enzyme thymidylate synthase (TS; EC 2.1.1.45), which catalyzes the reductive methylation of dUMP to form dTMP and is essential for DNA replication during cell growth and proliferation. Previous work from our laboratory showed that degradation of TS is ubiquitin-independent and mediated by an intrinsically disordered 27-residue region at the N-terminal end of the molecule. In the current study we show that this region, in cooperation with an alpha-helix formed by the next 15 residues, functions as a degron, i.e. it is capable of destabilizing a heterologous protein to which it is fused. Comparative analysis of the primary sequence of TS from a number of mammalian species revealed that the N-terminal domain is hypervariable among species yet is conserved with regard to its disordered nature, its high Pro content, and the occurrence of Pro at the penultimate site. Characterization of mutant proteins showed that Pro-2 protects the N terminus against N(alpha)-acetylation, a post-translational process that inhibits TS degradation. However, although a free amino group at the N terminus is necessary, it is not sufficient for degradation of the polypeptide. The implications of these findings to the proteasome-targeting function of the N-terminal domain, particularly with regard to its intrinsic flexibility, are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2149173205,"The surface-localized M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes is a major virulence factor that inhibits phagocytosis, as determined ex vivo. Because little is known about the role of M protein in vivo we analyzed the contribution of different M protein regions to virulence, using the fibrinogen (Fg)-binding M5 protein and a mouse model of acute invasive infection. This model was suitable, because M5 is required for mouse virulence and binds mouse and human Fg equally well, as shown here. Mixed infection experiments with wild type bacteria demonstrated that mutants lacking the N-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) or the Fg-binding B-repeat region were strongly attenuated, while a mutant lacking the conserved C-repeats was only slightly attenuated. Because the HVR of M5 is not required for phagocytosis resistance, our data imply that this HVR plays a major but unknown role during acute infection. The B-repeat region is required for phagocytosis resistance and specifically binds Fg, suggesting that it promotes virulence by binding Fg. However, B-repeat mutants were attenuated even in Fg-deficient mice, implying that the B-repeats may have a second function, in addition to Fg-binding. These data demonstrate that two distinct M5 regions, including the HVR, are essential to virulence during the early stages of an infection. In particular, our data provide the first in vivo evidence that the HVR of an M protein plays a major role in virulence, focusing interest on the molecular role of this region."

The accurate repair of DNA damage is crucial for the maintenance of genome integrity and the prevention of tumors. A pair of recent studies in Science (Ahel et al., 2009Ahel D. Horejsi Z. Wiechens N.

USA. 2009; 106: 13770-13774Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) reveals that the chromatin remodeling factor “Amplified in Liver Cancer 1” (Alc1, also known as “Chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein 1-like” [Chd1L]) may participate in the initiation of cancer. Alc1 belongs to the SNF2 gene family and is found in excessive amounts in ∼50% of liver cancers. Alc1 normally loosens tightly packaged chromatin to allow for repair of DNA damage. In cancer cells, however, too much ALC1 can overly relax the chromatin, making the DNA vulnerable to mistakes and thus raising the risk of cancer. Furthermore, a recent Nature study reports that an additional SNF2 family member, Chd1, plays an essential role in the regulation of embryonic stem cell (ESC) pluripotency (Gaspar-Maia et al., 2009Gaspar-Maia A. Alajem A. Polesso F. Sridharan R. Mason M.J. Heidersbach A. Ramalho-Santos J. McManus M.T. Plath K. Meshorer E. Ramalho-Santos M. Nature. 2009; 460: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Combined, the trio of studies underscores the importance of DNA repair systems to both stem cells and tumors and highlight potential mechanistic similarities between the processes regulating pluripotency and oncogenesis. Alc1 is activated by poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) polymerase-1 (PARP-1), a DNA nick sensor enzyme that is activated by DNA breaks, during the posttranslational modification process termed “PARylation.” Activated PARP-1 cleaves NAD into nicotinamide and ADP-ribose and covalently attaches a PAR polymer to itself and other suitable protein substrates. PARP-1 and PAR are well known to play critical roles in chromatin organization, transcriptional regulation, and DNA replication and repair, but their underlying mechanism of action remains largely unclear. The recent demonstration that PARP-1 and PAR recruit and activate the chromatin remodeler Alc1 (Ahel et al., 2009Ahel D. Horejsi Z. Wiechens N. Polo S.E. Garcia-Wilson E. Ahel I. Flynn H. Skehel M. West S.C. Jackson S.P. et al.Science. 2009; 325: 1240-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar, Gottschalk et al., 2009Gottschalk A.J. Timinszky G. Kong S.E. Jin J. Cai Y. Swanson S.K.

USA. 2009; 106: 13770-13774Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar) suggests a mechanism by which they may function. Furthermore, Alc1 activity can be blocked by PARP-1 inhibitors, which have already been explored for use in cancer treatment, suggesting that the therapeutic activities of PARP-1 inhibitors may be due in part to indirect effects on Alc1. Together, these studies identify a new function of the SNF2 family member Alc1 (Chd1L) in cancer. In addition to this new role in oncogenesis, another SNF2 gene family has been shown to influence pluripotency (Gaspar-Maia et al., 2009Gaspar-Maia A. Alajem A. Polesso F. Sridharan R. Mason M.J. Heidersbach A. Ramalho-Santos J. McManus M.T. Plath K. Meshorer E. Ramalho-Santos M. Nature. 2009; 460: 863-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). In this case, Chd1 seems to act by keeping chromatin in an open configuration and thus poised to express genes essential for maintaining “stemness.” Importantly, Chd1 also influences the reprogramming of somatic cells back to a pluripotent state, in that inhibition or depletion of Chd1 hinders the generation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from adult cells. Determination of what other molecules collaborate with Chd1 to direct chromatin remodeling may aid efforts to increase the efficiency and safety of iPSC generation and may also shed new light on how cells transition from one type to another, a process that happens normally during embryonic development and tends to go astray in cancer. Given that Chd1L is regulated by PARylation, it will be interesting to investigate whether PARP-1 and PAR are also involved in Chd1-mediated chromatin remodeling and how the chromatin open state is maintained by Chd1. In contrast, an additional recent study in Nature Structural and Molecular Biology shows that PARP-1 and PAR may instead help to condense the chromatin in response to DNA damage (Timinszky et al., 2009Timinszky G. Till S. Hassa P.O. Hothorn M. Kustatscher G. Nijmeijer B. Colombelli J. Altmeyer M. Stelzer E.H. Scheffzek K. et al.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2009; 16: 923-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). X-ray crystallography reveals that when PARP-1 is activated by DNA damage, select macrodomain proteins rapidly detect and surround the resulting PAR to envelop it in a snug pocket. The histone macroH2A1.1 is one such PAR-binding protein, and although histones play a major role in assembling chromatin and keeping it together, they do not typically harbor macrodomains. Furthermore, cancer cells do not express macroH2A1.1, and so given that macroH2A1.1 normally helps to rapidly detect DNA damage, this unusually modified histone may represent a “missing link” in cancer. Because macroH2A1.1 is embedded in chromatin, when it recognizes PAR at DNA damage sites it drags the complex but highly organized tangle of chromatin with it. As a result, macroH2A1.1 condenses the chromatin environment around the damaged area. It is possible that by temporarily compacting the DNA, the broken ends of the DNA molecule are kept closer together, thereby increasing their opportunity for repair. However, how this model might explain the precise role of PARP-1 and PAR in mediating chromatin plasticity, not to mention pluripotency, remains to be determined. Recently, five papers appeared simultaneously in Nature that indicated that the tumor suppressor p53 acts as a barrier to induced pluripotency (discussed in Krizhanovsky and Lowe, 2009Krizhanovsky V. Lowe S.W. Nature. 2009; 460: 1085-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar), and such a finding may also add to the evidence connecting PARP-1 to pluripotency and cancer. Specifically, inactivating or deleting p53 allows for a ∼100-fold increase in iPSC reprogramming efficiency, consistent with previous efforts that utilized siRNA-mediated p53 knockdown (Zhao et al., 2008Zhao Y.

PARP-1 and p53 are well known to interact both physically and functionally, and the two proteins have been nicknamed the “guardians of the genome.” Gao et al., 2009Gao F. Kwon S.W. Zhao Y. Jin Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 22263-22273Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar reveal that PARylation promotes the differentiation of pluripotent ESCs. Thus, it is reasonable to speculate that PARP-1, like p53, may impede somatic cell reprogramming back to a pluripotent state. Clearly, although already well studied, many of the biological functions of the PARP-1/p53 complex remain to be discovered. The combination of recent studies raises interesting questions and suggests that further study of their enigmatic functions may yield improved protocols for efficient iPSC generation. For example, would additional studies support the notion that molecules critically involved in genome stability, such as PARP-1 and p53, function as not only “guardians of the genome,” but also “barriers to pluripotency”? Genome integrity may indeed be a fundamental requirement for stem cell pluripotency and reprogramming. With the recent demonstration that iPSCs pass the ultimate test for pluripotency and in fact yield healthy, live mice via tetraploid complementation (Zhao et al., 2009Zhao X.Y. Li W. Lv Z. Liu L.

However, the collection of new findings discussed above appears to strengthen, rather than overcome, the fundamental link between induced pluripotency and tumorgenicity. It does appear that the major guardians of the genome also serve as roadblocks for iPSC generation and that simultaneous and systematic destruction of these roadblocks may improve reprogramming efficiency. But at what cost, and will it be safe? Reprogramming methods that include inactivation or deletion of p53 allow even cells burdened with heavy DNA damage to be turned into stem cells. Although such methods may not seem desirable (at least not for therapeutic use of iPSCs), this approach may help to establish useful cellular models for a variety of diseases in which the target somatic cells have proven difficult to reprogram. Of course, loss of p53 can lead to transformation of the resulting iPSCs, but this risk could be minimized by restoring p53 expression once iPSCs have been derived or by using chemical inhibitors or other means to transiently inactivate p53. Given that the efficiency of cell reprogramming technologies remains woefully low, any methods that help to improve efficiency are likely to be of tremendous practical use. Altogether, the critical new insights provided by this flurry of recent investigations that probe the roles of key players involved in genome integrity and chromatin plasticity, and that address how chromatin is kept “loose,” collectively underscore the growing link that connects the cancer and stem cell biology fields."
https://openalex.org/W2069828095,"Human embryonic stem cells have been characterized as a rare and precious resource because of the scarcity of the materials used in their creation and the many restrictions that have been placed on their derivation and use. With the advent of induced pluripotent stem cells, however, pluripotency stands to become a plentiful and unencumbered commodity. Human embryonic stem cells have been characterized as a rare and precious resource because of the scarcity of the materials used in their creation and the many restrictions that have been placed on their derivation and use. With the advent of induced pluripotent stem cells, however, pluripotency stands to become a plentiful and unencumbered commodity. The first cultured cells that were shown to exhibit pluripotency were embryonal carcinoma cells, through studies arising directly from the work of Leroy Stevens with teratomas (meaning “monstrous tumors”) in mouse. It was nearly 15 years before the first reports of a nonmalignant pluripotent cell appeared in the form of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and more than 15 years again before Thomson et al. derived the first human ESCs (see Andrews, 2002Andrews P.W. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2002; 357: 405-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar for a review of the early history of pluripotency). Despite tracing their heritage back to a monster, human ESCs (hESCs) were recognized immediately as a precious biological resource. Their perceived value stemmed from fundamental scientific interest, as well as their tremendous therapeutic promise, should their capacity for differentiation, self-renewal, and proliferation be harnessed for regenerative medicine applications. ESCs were also deemed precious, however, because they were rare. The finite number of available lines was not only because of the scarcity of their biological source, the inner cell mass of a preimplantation embryo, and the low efficiency of early derivation procedures but also subsequently because of the ethically charged nature of that source, which resulted in restrictions being placed on the freedom of scientists in some countries to generate and/or study them and of funding agencies to support such research. The combination of these biological, technical, political, religious, and ethical factors militated against the unfettered development of hESC research as a globally inclusive field, to the extent that only a few hundred hESC lines have been established in the decade since their original derivation, and only a tiny number of those lines are in active use even today (Scott et al., 2009Scott C.T. McCormick J.B. Owen-Smith J. Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 696-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). At the same time that many groups were seeking a noncontroversial alternate source of pluripotent human cells, multiple labs reported the establishment of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in 2007, following on the pioneering work by Takahashi and Yamanaka, who established the first murine iPSC lines the previous year (reviewed in Yamanaka, 2009Yamanaka S. Cell. 2009; 137: 13-17Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Although this research was not primarily motivated by the desire to work around restrictive hESC regulations, the generation of iPSCs was hailed by many as a solution to the ethical challenges faced by hESC researchers. Now, the rapid development of diverse safer and more efficient methods for deriving human iPSCs, combined with the extremely diverse and readily available cell types from which they can be generated, stands to change how we think about pluripotency in human cells. Specifically, pluripotent cells were first considered a precious and (in practical terms) scarce resource and have now become a plentiful, theoretically limitless, commodity. Importantly, by increasing access to, or supply of, usable pluripotent cells, this form of commodification brings about a decrease in the value of any individual source or instance of pluripotency, and simultaneously elevates the value of pluripotency, as an accessible research and potential therapeutic construct, in more general terms. As has been seen in other technological breakthroughs, such as computational power or gene sequencing, the calculus of value may quickly shift from one of restricted availability and correspondingly high unit value to one in which the opposite relationship prevails. The implications of this change are profound, not only in terms of the scientific usage of such cells but also in terms of the ethical, legal, and social issues that surround their use as well. The commodification of pluripotency by the arrival of iPSCs has not entirely diluted the value of the ESC, which is still generally held to be the “gold standard” by which all pluripotency should be judged, given their ability to give rise to live offspring via tetraploid complementation (in mice) and to form teratomas on transplantation into a living mouse (for hESCs). Furthermore, the processes underlying the generation of iPSCs remain relatively poorly understood, and without side-by-side study with ESCs, it is unlikely that the field will tease apart the detailed mechanisms that regulate pluripotency. In an influential review, Maherali and Hochedlinger suggested that iPSCs should be evaluated for pluripotency in accordance with a previously developed hierarchy of criteria, beginning with in vitro differentiation and ending with (for mouse ESCs) tetraploid complementation (Maherali and Hochedlinger, 2008Maherali N. Hochedlinger K. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 595-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar). Recognizing that for technical and ethical reasons not all of these tests could be performed on human iPSCs, the authors allowed that proof of authenticity be made by the “highest-stringency test available.” This proposed allowance triggered a pair of opposing responses from groups of pluripotent stem cell researchers. The first expressed concern over the potential for misidentification of nonpluripotent cell colonies as iPSCs and favored a strict interpretation of pluripotency (Daley et al., 2009Daley G.Q. Lensch M.W. Jaenisch R. Meissner A. Plath K. Yamanaka S. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 200-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), whereas the second group agreed that lax criteria should in some cases be acceptable (Ellis et al., 2009Ellis J. Bruneau B.G. Keller G. Lemischka I.R. Nagy A. Rossant J. Srivastava D. Zandstra P.W. Stanford W.L. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 198-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Interestingly, two of the major reasons for the loose standards group's recommendation were that strictu sensu pluripotency is not also the most important determinant of value, and that, “for iPS technology to have its most profound impact, it is important to simplify the entrance requirements” in order to allow more labs to enter the field (Ellis et al., 2009Ellis J. Bruneau B.G. Keller G. Lemischka I.R. Nagy A. Rossant J. Srivastava D. Zandstra P.W. Stanford W.L. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 198-199Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Although it is arguable that the distinction is a semantic one, this perspective seems to signal a shift, in at least some of the scientific community, from valuing pluripotent cells simply for the fact that they are pluripotent to valuing them for a subset of the things they can do. This growing paradigm shift is particularly evident given that both the Daley and Ellis letters acknowledged that teratoma formation (a hallmark of pluripotency) is a decidedly undesirable feature of otherwise highly differentiative cells if used in clinical applications (Daley et al., 2009Daley G.Q. Lensch M.W. Jaenisch R. Meissner A. Plath K. Yamanaka S. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 4: 200-201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, Ellis et al., 2009Ellis J. Bruneau B.G.

This caveat in no way tarnishes the luster of the gold standard of pluripotency, only suggests a change in perception that may lead to more researchers approaching pluripotency as a useful starting point, rather than an object of study itself. Granted, the findings that extant iPSCs from different sources show highly variable tumorigenicity (Miura et al., 2009Miura K. Okada Y. Aoi T. Okada A. Takahashi K. Okita K. Nakagawa M. Koyanagi M. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. et al.Nat. Biotechnol. 2009; 27: 743-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar) and significant differences in gene expression from hESCs (Chin et al., 2009Chin M.H. Mason M.J. Xie W. Volinia S. Singer M. Peterson C. Ambartsumyan G. Aimiuwu O. Richter L. Zhang J. et al.Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 111-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar) highlight the need for further study, but these properties are unlikely to signal a retreat back into the arms of hESCs for labs concerned with future applications. Commodification has brought democratization as well. This result is clear given the significant contributions to the study of iPSCs made by individual labs that for legal or funding-related reasons may have been precluded from working with hESCs. The broadened access to pluripotent stem cells is not simply the result of relaxed criteria; it is also due to their ethically uncomplicated source. iPSCs, famed for leveling out the “epigenetic landscape,” have, from at least some perspectives, effectively leveled the regulatory landscape as well. That said, the ISSCR continues to call for their “Guidelines for the Conduct of Human Embryonic Stem Cell Research” to be applied “to the use of human totipotent or pluripotent cells or human pluripotent stem cell lines” in general (in section 4, “Scope of the Guidelines”), and it is possible that stem cell research organizations or other regulatory bodies may seek to extend the cumbersome rules originally designed to govern research using human embryos to the oversight of human pluripotent stem cells as a whole. Importantly, although the former U.S. President's Council on Bioethics declared the then still-speculative “de-differentiated somatic cells” as “nothing to object to ethically,” (PCBE, 2005PCBE (President's Council on Bioethics) President's Council on Bioethics, Washington, D.C.2005Google Scholar) it is unlikely that iPSCs will be entirely free of ethical problems as they become more widely accessible. In their excellent review, Aalto-Setälä et al. propose changes to the donor consent requirements that may be required when collecting somatic cells to transform to pluripotency, given the potentially expanded possibilities for use in genetic modification, human-animal chimerism, genome sequencing, and commercialization, as well as in medical and reproductive applications (Aalto-Setälä et al., 2009Aalto-Setälä K. Conklin B.R. Lo B. PLoS Biol. 2009; 7: e42Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The potential for human iPSCs to be used in germline differentiation and reproductive applications is perhaps the most ethically fraught of these possibilities. Japan initially went so far as to ban experiments intended to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells into the germ lineage, although these restrictions have subsequently been relaxed. The demonstration that iPSCs can give rise to live mice through tetraploid complementation opens up the further possibility of reproductive cloning (Zhao et al., 2009Zhao X.Y. Li W. Lv Z. Liu L. Tong M. Hai T. Hao J. Guo C.L. Ma Q.W. Wang L. et al.Nature. 2009; 461: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar, Kang et al., 2009Kang L. Wang J. Zhang Y. Kou Z. Gao S. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 135-138Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar). Although this technique has never successfully been used with human cells (which would also be illegal in many countries), the past record of putative reproductive cloning attempts suggests that more groups and individuals will probably pursue this goal as the technology becomes simpler and more efficient in animal models. Even without going so far as cloning a person, the ability to generate human sperm and, potentially someday, oocytes from any somatic cell raises a whole spectrum of ethical tensions on the horizon, tensions for which current legal systems appear to be insufficiently prepared. These issue include the prospect for infertile, lesbian, and/or gay couples to have genetic children through a combination of reprogramming stem cells into gametes and modifying them with missing gender-specific genes, which although already discussed in the public arena, seems unlikely from a biological point of view (Mathews et al., 2009Mathews D.J. Donovan P.J. Harris J. Lovell-Badge R. Savulescu J. Faden R. Cell Stem Cell. 2009; 5: 11-14Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Yet, although such practices remain highly speculative at present, the ongoing rapid progress in the field and the lowering of regulatory entry barriers increase the likelihood of unforeseen new applications emerging. The commodification of pluripotent stem cells is not merely a convenient metaphor; iPSCs are already giving rise to a fledgling industry. Companies have begun to market culture kits for human iPSCs, and given the success, irrespective of utility, of private banks for the storage of umbilical cord blood cells and stem cells from deciduous teeth, menstrual blood, peripheral blood, and bone marrow, it is almost certain that plans for a private iPSC bank are already being laid. Indeed, when the Chinese stem cell tourism company Beike Biotechnology opened its Jiangsu Stem Cell Storage Facility in mid-2008, the company specifically cited its intent to store human iPSCs in the future. This trend by no means suggests that safe and effective clinical applications for these cells will soon become available, only that when the value placed on pluripotency is combined with a readily obtainable cell source and an unregulated business environment, industry is sure to follow. Given this eventuality and the significant potential risks associated with the transplantation of undifferentiated pluripotent cells, competent authorities will need to move quickly to develop quality standards and mechanisms of enforcement. Similarly, although I am not aware of any clinics that offer to inject iPSCs into patients willing to pay for them, the success of the stem cell tourism businesses that advertise other cell types (Kiatpongsan and Sipp, 2009Kiatpongsan S. Sipp D. Science. 2009; 323: 1564-1565Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, Lau et al., 2008Lau D. Ogbogu U. Taylor B. Stafinski T. Menon D. Caulfield T. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 591-594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) seems to guarantee that someone, somewhere will give it a try (or at least claim to), and such a possibility further highlights the need for appropriate protective measures given that many of the technical and regulatory barriers that previously restricted access to human pluripotent cells have now been overcome. The plurality of methods now available for the generation of human iPSCs also raises interesting questions as to how intellectual property claims will be made, and valued, concerning methods for inducing pluripotency. Should a single patented method become dominant, that patent would presumably be of much greater value than a comparable hESC patent (such as the fundamental patents owned by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and licensed to Geron) because the potential user base would be much broader, both for those deriving new lines and even using existing ones that fall under the patent's domain. Correspondingly, the existence of multiple competing methods would reduce the value of any given patent in a similarly sized market. How the intellectual property landscape is ultimately mapped is likely to remain in doubt pending the development of one or more techniques for induction by small molecules, and legal tests of the strength of the resulting patents. For now, the extant patents on iPSC technologies remain comparatively narrow and unchallenged in court, and yet one could safely predict that much remains to be seen regarding the protection and commercialization of iPSC derivation protocols and the cell lines that are produced. Business issues aside, research institutions and support frameworks are already struggling to readjust to the new reality of pluripotency as a “cheap” and plentiful commodity, rather than a scarce and precious resource. Existing hESC cell banks, including the U.S. National Stem Cell Bank (www.nationalstemcellbank.org/) and the cell bank at the RIKEN BioResource Center in Japan (http://www.brc.riken.go.jp) have already begun to bank iPSCs, and registries such as the International Stem Cell Registry at the University of Massachusetts (http://www.umassmed.edu/iscr) and the E.U.'s Human Embryonic Stem Cell Registry (www.hescreg.eu) are beginning to catalog existing human iPSC lines. But now that some studies generate dozens of new human iPSC lines, it is improbable that any registry, let alone stem cell bank, will be able to keep pace with output. Indeed, many researchers may not see the value of banking new lines or even maintaining them; pluripotency has not only become a commodity, it is becoming a disposable one. Indeed, even with the highly valued hESCs, some labs complained of the costs in time, money, and effort to fulfill the characterization and pluripotency tests required to merit a full listing in the more stringent registries. Of course, there remains important value in the public banking of well-characterized, standardized, and quality-controlled human iPSC lines, and there is scope for a bank of selected HLA-matched iPSCs (Nakatsuji et al., 2008Nakatsuji N. Nakajima F. Tokunaga K. Nat. Biotechnol. 2008; 26: 739-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). However, should a highly reproducible, safe, and efficient method for their generation become available, human pluripotent cell lines are likely to flood the field in unmanageable numbers. This predicted trend raises the same sorts of questions addressed by Maherali and Hochedlinger, Daley et al., and Ellis et al., as mentioned above. In the event that a strict standard for pluripotency is adopted by the research community, it is conceivable that a handful of well-characterized, standardized, and centrally banked iPSC lines could come to dominate the field. Once again, if a highly efficient, reproducible protocol for generating iPSCs becomes available, I predict that many labs would choose to do the work of generating lines themselves, unless the intellectual property landscape makes the “do-it-yourself” approach prohibitively expensive. In either instance, individual researchers are unlikely to spend as much time as they have in the past on characterization and the meticulous passaging of lines. It also seems certain that human iPSCs will be used with increasing frequency by labs that previously did not work with stem cells; in the not-so-distant future, we may even witness the induction of pluripotency as a high school science class project. The stem cell and reprogramming fields are moving so quickly, in fact, that pluripotency itself may one day no longer be seen as so necessary, and therefore so valuable, as it is today. Early work by Weintraub et al., 1989Weintraub H. Tapscott S.J. Davis R.L. Thayer M.J. Adam M.A. Lassar A.B. Miller A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 1989; 86: 5434-5438Crossref PubMed Scopus (735) Google Scholar, along with more recent successes in direct reprogramming across lineages of differentiated somatic cells (reviewed in Zhou and Melton, 2008Zhou Q. Melton D.A. Cell Stem Cell. 2008; 3: 382-388Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar), highlight the first steps on a road that may take pluripotency from a coveted resource to a plentiful commodity, to just one of many possible routes toward the long-sought goal of control over cellular identity. For this reason, policy-setters should exercise caution when developing their strategies for the long term; it took less than 10 years from the first derivation of human ESCs to the first human iPSCs, but some countries have already committed large sums to 10 year plans for the specific promotion of the field of induced pluripotency at a time when its future is far from certain. There is ample precedent for the rapid downward change in the unit value of a resource or technology as related resources become more accessible, a trajectory that I would argue human ESCs are already on. The predictions of Moore's Law and the related “Carlson Curve,” which tracks the rapidly declining costs of DNA synthesis, stand as testament to the transformational role played by new technologies on the value of individual instances of once-rare resources. But perhaps the most apt (or at least the most aesthetic) comparison can be made with the modern mass production of flawless and nearly indistinguishable manmade diamonds for a minute fraction of the value at which a similar natural diamond could be sold. Speculative author Neal Stephenson predicted such an eventuality in his novel The Diamond Age, which itself was a fictional examination of the transformational power of technology. The diamond industry is even now fighting to maintain the market value of their natural products by lobbying for protective laws and developing detection methods to discriminate one source from another. Thus, both diamonds and pluripotent cells represent resources that were scarce, as a result of a combination of natural and social factors, and that are on their way to becoming more plentiful, less costly, and minimally problematic to work with. As a result, both cases are paving the way toward new innovations and applications (synthetic diamonds, for example, are already being studied for potential uses in optics and electronics). Although the primary value of human pluripotent stem cells has thus far been perceptual rather than economic, we too are faced with the need to reassess the value of the old gold standards now that we stand on the brink of our own Diamond Age."
https://openalex.org/W2089194942,"Splenic enlargement (splenomegaly) develops in numerous disease states, although a specific pathogenic role for the spleen has rarely been described. In polycythemia vera (PV), an activating mutation in Janus kinase 2 (JAK2V617) induces splenomegaly and an increase in hematocrit. Splenectomy is sparingly performed in patients with PV, however, due to surgical complications. Thus, the role of the spleen in the pathogenesis of human PV remains unknown. We specifically tested the role of the spleen in the pathogenesis of PV by performing either sham (SH) or splenectomy (SPL) surgeries in a murine model of JAK2V617F-driven PV. Compared to SH-operated mice, which rapidly develop high hematocrits after JAK2V617F transplantation, SPL mice completely fail to develop this phenotype. Disease burden (JAK2V617) is equivalent in the bone marrow of SH and SPL mice, however, and both groups develop fibrosis and osteosclerosis. If SPL is performed after PV is established, hematocrit rapidly declines to normal even though myelofibrosis and osteosclerosis again develop independently in the bone marrow. In contrast, SPL only blunts hematocrit elevation in secondary, erythropoietin-induced polycythemia. We conclude that the spleen is required for an elevated hematocrit in murine, JAK2V617F-driven PV, and propose that this phenotype of PV may require a specific interaction between mutant cells and the spleen."

The success of this technique may increase demand for human oocyte donation for research. “It will not work.” This statement represents the four words that best motivate a scientist. Certainly, it is what I would have said to Mitalipov's team if they had pitched me the idea of transferring the spindle of one egg into the cytosol of another, enucleated egg with the expectation to produce a baby from THAT. Even so, I would have been wrong. Indeed, in their recent Nature article, Tachibana et al., 2009Tachibana M. Sparman M. Sritanaudomchai H. Ma H. Clepper L. Woodward J. Li Y. Ramsey C. Kolotushkina O.

Not only were the authors able to fertilize the ST eggs, they generated blastocysts healthy enough to permit the derivation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs), and when the embryos were transferred into the uterus of a surrogate mother, healthy babies were born. This is not an easy task; there are multiple hurdles that had to be cleared in order to achieve their success. If we bow to the astronauts that repair the Hubble telescope—and they deserve this respect when they risk their lives by manipulating equipment at a speed of 18,000 miles an hour and with no gravity—we must also bow to the Oregon team that accomplished ST. The authors managed to take a primate egg, probably the most valuable single cell in the body, maintain its viability for hours, subject it to exceptionally precise microsurgery to remove only 11 picolitres of cytosol, introduce the precious cargo from a different oocyte by performing a rendezvous maneuver with the postsurgery egg still in the microscope, fuse them, and subsequently trigger development by injecting a sperm directly into its cytosol. Four healthy monkeys were born after that sequence; what a feat! What can go wrong during this process? In a nutshell, anything and everything could go wrong. If you are not aware and respectful of the physiology of the egg, the experiment is doomed. For starters, the window of time to remove the chromosomes successfully is small. The egg must maintain high levels of maturation promoting factor (MPF) in order to keep the chromosomes collected together, like a tight bouquet of flowers. If the operation is done prematurely, the chromosomes will not be sufficiently condensed, and too many host mitochondria will also be flushed away. If the operation is done too late, the chromosomes will drift apart as the MPF activity begins to decline, probably compromising the capacity of the sperm to trigger development. Introducing a different set of chromosomes wrapped inside a tiny cell membrane package is not trivial, and delivering them intact inside the enucleated egg is also a challenge. Direct injection carries the risk of losing the genetic material during their aspiration and or ejection from the injection needle. Fusion is the safest option but, if performed with the traditional method of using an electrical pulse, the developmental potential of the egg will be compromised because of premature activation. Instead, the authors relied on one of the oldest “tricks” in the book and used inactivated sendai virus to fuse the two cell membranes. While on paper this progression may seem as simple as a series of well-orchestrated experimental steps, in reality success depends on having top-quality biological material and many, many hours of training at the microscope. If proven to translate from monkey cells to human oocytes, the proposed use of the technique would be for the treatment—if not eradication—of human mitochondrial diseases in the offspring of an affected biological mother. The scheme necessitates that women are willing to donate their healthy eggs to those that need them, not to mention the experimental progress—and demand for human eggs—that the translation to the clinic will require. Thus, in addition to the technical challenges described above, moving this technique into a routine clinical practice runs into an old and challenging dilemma.

Tomoda K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2007; 131: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13470) Google Scholar), the field has struggled with the ethical challenge posed by the idea of creating patient-specific ESCs via somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) (Cibelli et al., 2001Cibelli J. Kiessling A.A. Cunniff K. Richards C. Lanza R.P. West M.D. J. Regen. Med. 2001; 2: 25-31Google Scholar). Specifically, although SCNT offered hope for those trying to help patients suffering from devastating diseases, the technique raised legitimate worries that the need for human eggs could put the women who supply them at risk, dampening the excitement of having a new tool—albeit a powerful one—to cure patients. Indeed, when Takahashi et al., 2007Takahashi K. Tanabe K. Ohnuki M. Narita M. Ichisaki T. Tomoda K. Yamanaka S. Cell. 2007; 131: 861-872Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13470) Google Scholar and Yu et al., 2007Yu J. Vodyanik M.A. Smuga-Otto K. Antosiewicz-Bourget J. Frane J.L. Tian S. Nie J. Jonsdottir G.A. Ruotti V. Stewart R. et al.Science. 2007; 318: 1917-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (7575) Google Scholar announced the generation of human iPSCs, a collective sigh of relief was almost audible, as the field embraced an approach that promised to bypass the need for human embryos. Nonetheless, some scientists, and I identify myself among them, believe that human eggs will still be needed for some time to come, in order to help us truly understand their unique properties that permit dedifferentiation and rejuvenation of differentiated cells. Of course, such need will never reach the proportions of what we thought the field faced when SCNT was the only route to generate isogenic ESCs. Which brings us back to the implications of the new technique described by Tachibana et al., 2009Tachibana M. Sparman M. Sritanaudomchai H. Ma H. Clepper L. Woodward J. Li Y. Ramsey C. Kolotushkina O. Mitalipov S. Nature. 2009; (in press. Published online August 26, 2009)https://doi.org/10.1038/nature08368Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar. Will the possibility of ST reignite the debate over the need for high-quality human eggs? Considering the devastating consequences of mitochondrial diseases and the possibilities that ST can offer to parents in search of a cure, the answer seems self evident. How could there not be a demand to extend their work into a human context? Of course, given that SCNT has yet to be conclusively translated from monkey to human cells, future success of human ST is far from certain. Moreover, the question of how researchers might demonstrate the feasibility and safety of ST with human cells presents significant ethical challenges in and of itself. Nonetheless, in addition to the promise that ST offers to those suffering from heritable mitochondrial disease, there is at least one other constituency that likely find ST technology a hopeful therapeutic alternative. During 2006, almost 17,000 in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles were performed with donated eggs for women whose own oocytes were, for some reason, of low quality. Assuming the DNA itself is not the reason for the failures, human ST would likely be the first choice for these patients, if the technology were proven to be effective. Older women could have children carrying their own DNA thanks to the cytosolic contribution of a healthy, young surrogate egg. This procedure could certainly be attempted prior to undertaking IVF with intact donor eggs, resulting in a child related to the donor and not the woman who carried the fetus to term. The long-term safety and efficacy of the ST technique will have to be shown, something that the Oregon team is likely planning to undertake. Certainly, the debate over the continuing need for donated oocytes that we thought was put to rest in 2007 has just been resurrected (Figure 1). And it caught us almost as unprepared as in 1997, or worse. The legal landscape concerning the compensation of egg donors varies widely, especially across the US, ranging from allowing for payment (New York), to compensation for expenses and lost wages (California), to banning it altogether (Michigan). Perhaps it is time to establish a comprehensive, federal policy that would both protect women and also sponsor the research necessary to test whether a technique such as ST can be used in the clinic. The repercussions of the ST technique go beyond its practical application in the clinic. For years there has been a “closeted” debate on whether assisted reproductive techniques such as IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) could have detrimental health effects on children. The rationale for this concern is based on evidence gathered mostly in laboratory animals, such as the finding that slight changes in the composition of the medium in which mouse embryos are cultured significantly alter its gene expression (Rinaudo and Schultz, 2004Rinaudo P. Schultz R. Reproduction. 2004; 128: 301-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Considering that the first rounds of division in the embryo are driven by molecules already present in the unfertilized egg, its responsibility on the fate of the offspring cannot be underestimated, and yet has been challenging to study. ST can help us answer some of these questions. By exploring the possibility of taking the chromosomes from an egg—deemed of high quality—and transferring it to the cytosol of an egg of low quality (or the opposite), we could not only answer the question of how important is the quality of the egg cytosol on the fate of an embryo, but we could also investigate which critical egg genes predestine the embryo to succeed or fail; all done in primates. But to conduct these important basic science investigations, with the hopes of eventually learning lessons to benefit future reproductive technologies, a source of human oocytes for research will be required. We bow to the Oregon scientists, while we brace ourselves for the arduous discussions to come as the field works to implement the technique they unveiled. Certainly, the question of what parallel laboratory tests can be undertaken ethically with human eggs and what level of preclinical safety assessment will be sufficient to permit the translation of ST into the clinic remain essential issues to be addressed. The need for human eggs for research is back. It seems like it never left the stage after all."

https://openalex.org/W2041203135,"In Ersilia, to establish the relationships that sustain the city’s life, the inhabitants stretch strings from the corners of the houses, white or black or gray or black-an-white according to whether they mark a relationship of blood, of trade, authority, agency. When the strings become so numerous that you can no longer pass among them, the inhabitants leave: the houses are dismantled; only the strings and their supports remain. From a mountainside, camping with their household goods, Ersilia’s refugees look at the labyrinth of taut strings and poles that rise in the plain. That is the city of Ersilia still, and they are nothing. They rebuild Ersilia elsewhere. They weave a similar pattern of strings which they would like to be more complex and at the same time more regular than the other. Then they abandon it and take themselves and their houses still farther away. Thus, when travelling in the territory of Ersilia, you come upon the ruins of abandoned cities, without the walls which do not last, without the bones of the dead which the wind rolls away: spiderwebs of intricate relationships seeking a form. —Italo Calvino, Invisible Cities (2)"
