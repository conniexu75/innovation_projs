It remained necessary, however, to demonstrate that the mould product, aflatoxin, which is responsible for the acute toxic effects of contaminated meals6 is also responsible for the carcinogenic activity."

https://openalex.org/W2055519946,"WE recently had occasion to search for compatible red cell donors for an I-negative patient with anti-I. Since more than 99.9 per cent of adults are I-positive we found no I-negative donors. Then, to our surprise, we found many I-negative patients in our hospital population."

While this is satisfactory for most isotopes in common use, the efficiency of counting tritium is undesirably low, being a fraction of the efficiency obtainable with tritiated toluene. Glass fibre paper, however, has been found to allow a much higher counting efficiency, approaching the theoretical maximum."

In the summer of 1963, however, an extremely large population of Euceraphis punctipennis Zett. was observed on weeping birch, Betula penduta tristris, near Driebergen, Holland. In late October the sexual females were ovipositing, and in mid-December 900 eggs, weighing a total of 60 mg, were collected. The eggs were macerated in a small glass homogenizer and their lipids extracted three times with 0.5 ml. of CHCl3 / MeOH (2:1 v/v). The extracts were combined, evaporated to dryness at 30° C in a stream of nitrogen, redissolved in the extraction solvent and the lipids purified after the method of Folch et al.1. The purified lipids weighed 8.3 mg, or 13.9 per cent of the fresh weight of the eggs."

https://openalex.org/W2065679818,"THE rapid phosphorolytic cleavage of 5-bromodeoxy-uridine (BUdR) and 5-iododeoxyuridine (IUdR) in vivo1,2 greatly limits the clinical usefulness of these thymidine analogues as antineoplastic agents3, radiosensitizers4, systemic antiviral compounds5, or detectors of malignant tissue2. Investigations in man with halogen-labelled analogues have indicated that a greater amount of BUdR is probably retained by the body than is IUdR under non-loading conditions2. We have devised a rapid and convenient method which permits one to make a direct comparison of the rate and extent of degradation of thymidine and its analogues in the same subject, and to examine the effect of loading doses, depot administration6, and the influence of 5-fluorodeoxyuridine6, or agents designed to reduce nucleoside phosphorolysis7 on the degradation of the analogues."
https://openalex.org/W2090163754,"PHENOMENA of ‘solubilization’ of carcinogens in nucleic acid solutions have been previously described1,2. For example, Boyland and Green2 reported that native DNA solubilizes more benz(a)pyrene than heat-denaturated DNA does. A slight bathochromic effect of 10 nm and quenching of the fluorescence were taken, following Steele and Szent-Gyorgyi3, as evidence of a molecular interaction. However, Giovanella, McKinney and Heidelberger4 questioned the interpretation of these findings and claimed that they were entirely due to a phenomenon of stabilization of the colloidal suspension of benz(a)pyrene by the nucleic acids. They concluded that no non-enzymatic interaction between the carcinogenic hydrocarbons and DNA could be proved."

Methyl linoleate and methyl linolenate are readily oxidized on exposure to ultra-violet radiation to yield products which inhibit enzymatic reactions1 and cellular respiration2 and interrupt division of yeast cells3. Other consequences of the autoxidation of lipids are detailed in a recent symposium4. This communication deals with an in vivo response of the mouse liver to an aqueous extract of ultraviolet-irradiated linolenic acid."

https://openalex.org/W2020367945,"AUTORADIOGRAPHIC investigations often require very large numbers of exposures. It is, therefore, necessary to have a rapid method for calculating the exposure times for the successive specimens of a series. Stowell1, in a communication directing attention to the value of special purpose slide rules, has described one on which the calculation may be made very rapidly."
https://openalex.org/W2021185437,"BOTH Mannik and Kunkel1 and Fahey2 have shown that there are two antigenic types of human γ-globulin, which differ in their light chains. Type I light chain bears the antigenic determinant characteristic for Bence–Jones protein group I—the same holds for type II light chains and the Bence–Jones protein group II antigenic determinant. With some antisera, the immunoelectrophoretic pattern of human γ-globulin shows two precipitin lines: these lines are parallel and approximately of equal length; one corresponds to type I γ-globulin, the other to type II."
