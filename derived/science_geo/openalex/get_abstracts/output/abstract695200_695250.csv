https://openalex.org/W4282542764,"The serotonin system modulates a wide variety of emotional behaviors and states, including reward processing, anxiety, and social interaction. To reveal the underlying patterns of neural activity, we visualized serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN5-HT) of mice using miniaturized microscopy during diverse emotional behaviors. We discovered ensembles of cells with highly correlated activity and found that DRN5-HT neurons are preferentially recruited by emotionally salient stimuli as opposed to neutral stimuli. Individual DRN5-HT neurons responded to diverse combinations of salient stimuli, with some preference for valence and sensory modality. Anatomically defined subpopulations projecting to either a reward-related structure (the ventral tegmental area) or an anxiety-related structure (the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis) contained all response types but were enriched in reward- and anxiety-responsive cells, respectively. Our results suggest that the DRN serotonin system responds to emotional salience using ensembles with mixed selectivity and biases in downstream connectivity."
https://openalex.org/W4282588860,"GluN3A is an atypical glycine-binding subunit of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) whose actions in the brain are mostly unknown. Here, we show that the expression of GluN3A subunits controls the excitability of mouse adult cortical and amygdalar circuits via an unusual signaling mechanism involving the formation of excitatory glycine GluN1/GluN3A receptors (eGlyRs) and their tonic activation by extracellular glycine. eGlyRs are mostly extrasynaptic and reside in specific neuronal populations, including the principal cells of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and SST-positive interneurons (SST-INs) of the neocortex. In the BLA, tonic eGlyR currents are sensitive to fear-conditioning protocols, are subject to neuromodulation by the dopaminergic system, and control the stability of fear memories. In the neocortex, eGlyRs control the in vivo spiking of SST-INs and the behavior-dependent modulation of cortical activity. GluN3A-containing eGlyRs thus represent a novel and widespread signaling modality in the adult brain, with attributes that strikingly depart from those of conventional NMDARs."
https://openalex.org/W4281924029,"The isolation of CCoV-HuPn-2018 from a child respiratory swab indicates that more coronaviruses are spilling over to humans than previously appreciated. We determined the structures of the CCoV-HuPn-2018 spike glycoprotein trimer in two distinct conformational states and showed that its domain 0 recognizes sialosides. We identified that the CCoV-HuPn-2018 spike binds canine, feline, and porcine aminopeptidase N (APN) orthologs, which serve as entry receptors, and determined the structure of the receptor-binding B domain in complex with canine APN. The introduction of an oligosaccharide at position N739 of human APN renders cells susceptible to CCoV-HuPn-2018 spike-mediated entry, suggesting that single-nucleotide polymorphisms might account for viral detection in some individuals. Human polyclonal plasma antibodies elicited by HCoV-229E infection and a porcine coronavirus monoclonal antibody inhibit CCoV-HuPn-2018 spike-mediated entry, underscoring the cross-neutralizing activity among ɑ-coronaviruses. These data pave the way for vaccine and therapeutic development targeting this zoonotic pathogen representing the eighth human-infecting coronavirus."
https://openalex.org/W4282833377,"Co-occurrent KRAS and TP53 mutations define a majority of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and define its pro-metastatic proclivity. Here, we demonstrate that KRAS-TP53 co-alteration is associated with worse survival compared with either KRAS-alone or TP53-alone altered PDAC in 245 patients with metastatic disease treated at a tertiary referral cancer center, and validate this observation in two independent molecularly annotated datasets. Compared with non-TP53 mutated KRAS-altered tumors, KRAS-TP53 co-alteration engenders disproportionately innate immune-enriched and CD8+ T-cell-excluded immune signatures. Leveraging in silico, in vitro, and in vivo models of human and murine PDAC, we discover a novel intersection between KRAS-TP53 co-altered transcriptomes, TP63-defined squamous trans-differentiation, and myeloid-cell migration into the tumor microenvironment. Comparison of single-cell transcriptomes between KRAS-TP53 co-altered and KRAS-altered/TP53WT tumors revealed cancer cell-autonomous transcriptional programs that orchestrate innate immune trafficking and function. Moreover, we uncover granulocyte-derived inflammasome activation and TNF signaling as putative paracrine mediators of innate immunoregulatory transcriptional programs in KRAS-TP53 co-altered PDAC. Immune subtyping of KRAS-TP53 co-altered PDAC reveals conflation of intratumor heterogeneity with progenitor-like stemness properties. Coalescing these distinct molecular characteristics into a KRAS-TP53 co-altered “immunoregulatory program” predicts chemoresistance in metastatic PDAC patients enrolled in the COMPASS trial, as well as worse overall survival."
https://openalex.org/W4281743018,"Tau aggregation underlies neurodegenerative tauopathies, and transcellular propagation of tau assemblies of unique structure, i.e., strains, may underlie the diversity of these disorders. Polyanions have been reported to induce tau aggregation in vitro, but the precise trigger to convert tau from an inert to a seed-competent form in disease states is unknown. RNA triggers tau fibril formation in vitro and has been observed to associate with neurofibrillary tangles in human brain. Here, we have tested whether RNA exerts sequence-specific effects on tau assembly and strain formation. We found that three RNA homopolymers, polyA, polyU, and polyC, all bound tau, but only polyA RNA triggered seed and fibril formation. In addition, polyA:tau seeds and fibrils were sensitive to RNase. We also observed that the origin of the RNA influenced the ability of tau to adopt a structure that would form stable strains. Human RNA potently induced tau seed formation and created tau conformations that preferentially formed stable strains in a HEK293T cell model, whereas RNA from other sources, or heparin, produced strains that were not stably maintained in cultured cells. Finally, we found that soluble, but not insoluble seeds from Alzheimer's disease brain were also sensitive to RNase. We conclude that human RNA specifically induces formation of stable tau strains and may trigger the formation of dominant pathological assemblies that propagate in Alzheimer's disease and possibly other tauopathies."
https://openalex.org/W4282961915,"The exceptional longevity of Ames dwarf (DF) mice can be abrogated by a brief course of growth hormone (GH) injections started at 2 weeks of age. This transient GH exposure also prevents the increase in cellular stress resistance and decline in hypothalamic inflammation characteristic of DF mice. Here, we show that transient early-life GH treatment leads to permanent alteration of pertinent changes in adipocytes, fat-associated macrophages, liver, muscle, and brain that are seen in DF mice. Ames DF mice, like Snell dwarf and GHRKO mice, show elevation of glycosylphosphatidylinositol specific phospholipase D1 in liver, neurogenesis in brain as indicated by BDNF and DCX proteins, muscle production of fibronectin type III domain-containing protein 5 (a precursor of irisin), uncoupling protein 1 as an index of thermogenic capacity in brown and white fat, and increase in fat-associated anti-inflammatory macrophages. In each case, transient exposure to GH early in life reverts the DF mice to the levels of each protein seen in littermate control animals, in animals evaluated at 15-18 months of age. Thus, many of the traits seen in long-lived mutant mice, pertinent to age-related changes in inflammation, neurogenesis, and metabolic control, are permanently set by early-life GH levels."
https://openalex.org/W4282912904,"To explore the attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination among healthcare workers in the US, we surveyed three groups of individuals (essential non-healthcare workers, general healthcare workers, and correctional healthcare workers). We found surprisingly high portions of healthcare workers with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy/resistance, with 23% of correctional healthcare workers and 17% general healthcare workers (as compared to 12%) refusing to be vaccinated against COVID-19. Multivariate regression models suggest that current season flu vaccination (aOR = 3.34), relying on employer for COVID-19 information (aOR = 3.69), and living in the Midwest (aOR = 5.04) to be strongly associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among essential workers and general healthcare workers. Current season flu vaccination (aOR = 7.52) is also strongly associated with COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among correctional healthcare workers. Potential mechanisms of vaccine hesitancy/resistance among healthcare workers involves low health literacy and employer mistrust. Our findings are highly relevant as we try to reach COVID-19 vaccination goals in the US."
https://openalex.org/W4281877578,"The nucleotide context surrounding stop codons significantly affects the efficiency of translation termination. In eukaryotes, various 3' contexts that are unfavorable for translation termination have been described; however, the exact molecular mechanism that mediates their effects remains unknown. In this study, we used a reconstituted mammalian translation system to examine the efficiency of stop codons in different contexts, including several previously described weak 3' stop codon contexts. We developed an approach to estimate the level of stop codon readthrough in the absence of eukaryotic release factors (eRFs). In this system, the stop codon is recognized by the suppressor or near-cognate tRNAs. We observed that in the absence of eRFs, readthrough occurs in a 3' nucleotide context-dependent manner, and the main factors determining readthrough efficiency were the type of stop codon and the sequence of the 3' nucleotides. Moreover, the efficiency of translation termination in weak 3' contexts was almost equal to that in the tested standard context. Therefore, the ability of eRFs to recognize stop codons and induce peptide release is not affected by mRNA context. We propose that ribosomes or other participants of the elongation cycle can independently recognize certain contexts and increase the readthrough of stop codons. Thus, the efficiency of translation termination is regulated by the 3' nucleotide context following the stop codon and depends on the concentrations of eRFs and suppressor/near-cognate tRNAs."
https://openalex.org/W4281891512,"Sulfur-insertion reactions are essential for the biosynthesis of several cellular metabolites, including enzyme cofactors. In Lactobacillus plantarum, a sulfur-containing nickel-pincer nucleotide (NPN) cofactor is used as a coenzyme of lactic acid racemase, LarA. During NPN biosynthesis in L. plantarum, sulfur is transferred to a nicotinic acid–derived substrate by LarE, which sacrifices the sulfur atom of its single cysteinyl side chain, forming a dehydroalanine residue. Most LarE homologs contain three conserved cysteine residues that are predicted to cluster at the active site; however, the function of this cysteine cluster is unclear. In this study, we characterized LarE from Thermotoga maritima (LarETm) and show that it uses these three conserved cysteine residues to bind a [4Fe-4S] cluster that is required for sulfur transfer. Notably, we found LarETm retains all side chain sulfur atoms, in contrast to LarELp. We also demonstrate that when provided with L-cysteine and cysteine desulfurase from Escherichia coli (IscSEc), LarETm functions catalytically with IscSEc transferring sulfane sulfur atoms to LarETm. Native mass spectrometry results are consistent with a model wherein the enzyme coordinates sulfide at the nonligated iron atom of the [4Fe-4S] cluster, forming a [4Fe-5S] species, and transferring the noncore sulfide to the activated substrate. This proposed mechanism is like that of TtuA that catalyzes sulfur transfer during 2-thiouridine synthesis. In conclusion, we found that LarE sulfur insertases associated with NPN biosynthesis function either by sacrificial sulfur transfer from the protein or by transfer of a noncore sulfide bound to a [4Fe-4S] cluster.

In conclusion, we found that LarE sulfur insertases associated with NPN biosynthesis function either by sacrificial sulfur transfer from the protein or by transfer of a noncore sulfide bound to a [4Fe-4S] cluster. The biological interconversion of chemical isomers or enantiomers is of fundamental importance to the metabolism of living organisms and has many applications in biocatalysis, biotechnology, and drug discovery (1Martinez Cuesta S. Rahman S.A. Thornton J.M. Exploring the chemistry and evolution of the isomerases.Proc. Natl. Acid. Sci. U. S. A. 2016; 113: 1796-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Depending on their substrates, isomerases are divided into four subclasses that act on amino acids and derivatives, α-hydroxyacids and derivatives, carbohydrates and derivatives, and other substances. The isomerization of D/L-lactate is catalyzed by lactate racemase (Lar), an enzyme that, in Lactobacillus plantarum, is a combination of the LarA protein and a tethered nickel-pincer nucleotide (NPN) cofactor (2Desguin B. Zhang T. Soumillion P. Hols P. Hu J. Hausinger R.P. A tethered niacin-derived pincer complex with a nickel-carbon bond in lactate racemase.Science. 2015; 349: 66-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Homologs of LarA use NPN to catalyze racemization and epimerization reactions of a variety of α-hydroxy acid compounds other than lactate (3Desguin B. Urdiain-Arraiza J. Da Costa M. Fellner M. Hu J. Hausinger R.P. et al.Uncovering a superfamily of nickel-dependent hydroxyacid racemases and epimerases.Sci. Rep. 2020; 1018123Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of the NPN cofactor in L. plantarum requires three proteins that are encoded with LarA in the lar operon (Fig. 1) (4Desguin B. Goffin P. Viaene E. Kleerebezem M. Martin-Diaconescu V.

A. 2016; 113: 5598-5603Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). LarB is a carboxylase/hydrolase of nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD), forming pyridinium-3,5-biscarboxylic acid mononucleotide (P2CMN) (6Rankin J.A. Chatterjee S. Tariq Z. Lagishetty S. Desguin B. Hu J. et al.The LarB carboxylase/hydrolase forms a transient cysteinyl-pyridine intermediate during nickel-pincer nucleotide cofactor biosynthesis.Proc. Natl. Acid. Sci. U. S. A. 2021; 118e2106202118PubMed Google Scholar). LarE sequentially converts the two carboxylic acids of P2CMN into thiocarboxylic acids, producing first pyridinium-3-carboxy-5-thiocarboxylic acid mononucleotide (PCTMN) and then pyridinium-3,5-bisthiocarboxylic acid mononucleotide (P2TMN) (7Fellner M. Desguin B. Hausinger R.P. Hu J. Structural insights into the catalytic mechanism of a sacrificial sulfur insertase of the N-type ATP pyrophosphatase family, LarE.Proc. Natl. Acid. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114: 9074-9079Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Finally, LarC installs the nickel atom into P2TMN to generate NPN with the metal bonded in a planar arrangement by one carbon and two sulfur atoms of the coenzyme (8Desguin B. Fellner M. Riant O. Hu J. Hausinger R.P. Hols P. et al.Biosynthesis of the nickel-pincer nucleotide cofactor of lactate racemase requires a CTP-dependent cyclometallase.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 12303-12317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The organometallic cofactor binds to L. plantarum LarA with its nickel coordinating His200 and by a thioamide linkage with Lys184. Analogous histidinyl and lysyl residues are found in other LarA homologs; however, NPN is not covalently attached to all proteins with which it associates. This work focuses on the biosynthetic reaction catalyzed by LarE. Bioinformatics analysis reveals that LarE is a member of the PP-loop pyrophosphatase family that contains a PP-loop SGGXDS motif in its N-terminal region (9Fellner M. Hausinger R.P. Hu J. A structural perspective on the PP-loop ATP pyrophosphatase family.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2018; 53: 607-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). This motif is responsible for catalyzing the ATP-dependent adenylylation of one P2CMN carboxyl group, with the activated intermediate undergoing sulfur transfer to form PCTMN, then a second round of adenylylation and sulfur transfer provides P2TMN. For LarE from L. plantarum (LarELp) the sulfur originates from a cysteine residue (Cys176) of the protein, resulting in the formation of a dehydroalanine residue in LarELp, making it a sacrificial sulfur transferase (7Fellner M. Desguin B. Hausinger R.P. Hu J. Structural insights into the catalytic mechanism of a sacrificial sulfur insertase of the N-type ATP pyrophosphatase family, LarE.Proc. Natl. Acid. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114: 9074-9079Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). LarELp is structurally related to other ATP-dependent sulfur transferases that contain [4Fe-4S] clusters or that generate persulfides at their active sites, such as TtuA, MnmA, and ThiI (10Fellner M. Rankin J.A. Desguin B. Hu J. Hausinger R.P. Analysis of the active site cysteine residue of the sacrificial sulfur insertase LarE from Lactobacillus plantarum.Biochemistry. 2018; 57: 5513-5523Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculated that other LarE homologs may bind a [4Fe-4S] cluster or generate a persulfide instead of using an active site cysteine residue for catalytic sulfur transfer. In this study, we identify LarE from Thermotoga maritima (LarETm) as a [4Fe-4S] cluster-containing enzyme that coordinates the cluster using three cysteine residues. This conclusion is based on a combination of UV-visible (UV-vis) absorption and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopies coupled with iron and sulfide analyses as well as site-directed mutagenesis. In addition, we used in vitro enzyme assays to demonstrate that the cluster of LarETm is essential for its sulfur transferase activity. Unlike LarELp, LarETm does not sacrifice a cysteinyl sulfur atom during catalysis. Rather, we show the [4Fe-4S] cluster is used to catalyze multiple rounds of sulfur transfer when provided with L-cysteine in the presence of cysteine desulfurase from Escherichia coli (IscSEc). We used mass spectrometry (MS) studies to reveal that IscSEc can directly transfer sulfane sulfur to LarETm. From these results, we speculate that LarETm uses three conserved cysteines of the enzyme to bind the [4Fe-4S] cluster and coordinates a noncore sulfur atom at the fourth iron site, with the additional sulfur atom used to attack the activated substrate for sulfur transfer. This novel mechanism for LarETm resembles the sulfur-insertion reactions of thionucleotide-tRNA biosynthetic enzymes that also use tricoordinated [4Fe-4S] clusters to transfer a noncore sulfide (11Bimai O.

Biol. 2020; 65: 69-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 12Shigi N. Biosynthesis and degradation of sulfur modifications in tRNAs.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021; 22: 11937Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). We analyzed sequences of LarE from selected bacteria and archaea (Fig. S1) and found that most homologs contain two conserved motifs: SGGXDS (P-loop motif, shown beneath the green rectangular box) and two cysteines in a CXXC sequence with another cysteine located more distantly (i.e., the CXXC-C motif, shown beneath the blue rectangular boxes). In addition, a fourth cysteine residue is located adjacent to the CXXC-C motif in LarE sequences from T. maritima, Ignisphaera aggregans, and Deltaproteobacteria bacterium (shown by the yellow star), whereas the other sequences possess Ala, Ser, or Leu at this position. From the structure of LarELp in complex with Mg·ATP (Protein Data Bank ID: 5UDS), we know the SGGXDS motif (9Fellner M. Hausinger R.P. Hu J. A structural perspective on the PP-loop ATP pyrophosphatase family.Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 2018; 53: 607-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) is responsible for binding ATP, which is essential for activity (7Fellner M. Desguin B. Hausinger R.P. Hu J. Structural insights into the catalytic mechanism of a sacrificial sulfur insertase of the N-type ATP pyrophosphatase family, LarE.Proc. Natl. Acid. Sci. U. S. A. 2017; 114: 9074-9079Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The LarETm and LarELp sequences both contain the SGGXDS motif, but LarELp lacks the CXXC-C motif (Fig. 3). Moreover, a single residue shift occurs when comparing the active site Cys176 of LarELp to the third conserved Cys residue of the CXXC-C motif in LarETm. We used Alphafold2 (13Jumper J. Evans R. Pritzel A. Green T. Figurnov M. Ronneberger O. et al.Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold.Nature. 2021; 596: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (2502) Google Scholar) to build a homology model of LarETm (Fig. 4A) that reveals a clustering of the four cysteine residues (Fig. 4B). Ser180, Arg212, and Arg214 of LarELp are proposed to bind the phosphate of the substrate P2CMN; these residues are conserved in LarETm, so P2CMN is likely to bind in a similar manner. Significantly, the clustering of the three conserved cysteine residues is reminiscent of the situation for other PP-loop pyrophosphatase family members that catalyze sulfur transfer reactions using tricoordinated iron-sulfur clusters (10Fellner M. Rankin J.A. Desguin B. Hu J. Hausinger R.P. Analysis of the active site cysteine residue of the sacrificial sulfur insertase LarE from Lactobacillus plantarum.Biochemistry. 2018; 57: 5513-5523Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Thus, we speculated that LarE homologs containing CXXC-C motifs, including that from T. maritima, bind Fe-S clusters, which participate in their sulfur transferase reactions, thus avoiding the need to forfeit the sulfur atom of a thiolate side chain.Figure 4Homology model of LarETm.

The enzyme was reacted with ATP, MgCl2, and P2CMN (produced by incubation of LarB with NaAD and bicarbonate), as previously described (8Desguin B. Fellner M. Riant O. Hu J. Hausinger R.P. Hols P. et al.Biosynthesis of the nickel-pincer nucleotide cofactor of lactate racemase requires a CTP-dependent cyclometallase.J. Biol. Chem. 2018; 293: 12303-12317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The His6-tagged LarETm from the reaction mixture was directly examined by ESI-MS or characterized after further purification as described earlier (5Desguin B. Soumillion P. Hols P. Hausinger R.P. Nickel-pincer cofactor biosynthesis involves LarB-catalyzed pyridinium carboxylation and LarE-dependent sacrificial sulfur insertion.Proc. Natl. Acid. Sci. U. S. A. 2016; 113: 5598-5603Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The mass of the protein remained constant throughout the reaction time, indicating that LarETm does not sacrifice a cysteinyl sulfur atom during the reaction to produce P2TMN (Fig. S2). By contrast, we used the same approach to confirm that LarELp catalyzed the previously reported sacrificial sulfur transfer reaction (5Desguin B. Soumillion P. Hols P. Hausinger R.P. Nickel-pincer cofactor biosynthesis involves LarB-catalyzed pyridinium carboxylation and LarE-dependent sacrificial sulfur insertion.Proc. Natl. Acid. Sci. U. S. A. 2016; 113: 5598-5603Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The ESI-MS results for His6-tagged LarETm also confirm the homogeneity of the sample. Analysis by size-exclusion chromatography-multiangle light scattering demonstrated that the protein exists as dimer (Mr = 61,130 ± 36 Da) in solution (Fig. S3). The aerobically purified protein (subunit concentration of 160 μM) was brownish in color (Fig. 5A), but the intensity of the broad absorption (maximum at ∼410 nm) decreased with time when exposed to air (Fig. 5B). When aerobically purified His6-tagged LarETm (200 μM) was anaerobically incubated with iron and L-cysteine in the presence of IscSEc (i.e., cluster assembly conditions), the brownish color and the broad shoulder at 410 nm were greatly increased in intensity (Fig. 5C), consistent with an enhanced amount of cluster compared to the starting sample with its partially occupied metallocenter. The spectrum of anaerobic cluster-assembled LarETm (Fig. 5D) differed from that of the aerobically purified protein (Fig. 5B), presumably because the aerobic sample possessed some damaged cluster (e.g., [3Fe-4S], [2Fe-2S], and perhaps other species). Anaerobic addition of sodium dithionite into cluster-assembled LarETm (400 μM) bleached the protein color and greatly diminished the UV-vis absorption (Fig. 5D). Inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) revealed 4.1 ± 0.2 Fe atoms per subunit, and chemical analysis indicated the presence of 3.9 ± 0.2 inorganic sulfur atoms per monomer for protein that was analyzed after in vitro cluster assembly. These values are consistent with the presence of a [4Fe-4S] cluster in each subunit. We investigated the oxidation state properties of the [4Fe-4S] cluster in cluster-assembled LarETm by EPR spectroscopy. The initial spectrum displayed low intensity signals near g ∼2 at 10 K that are consistent with a small amount of the [4Fe-4S] cluster having been damaged and oxidized to form a [3Fe–4S]1+ cluster and radicals (14Shigi N.

This enzyme activity was lost after oxygen exposure. The activities of LarETm samples also were assessed by using an indirect assay that involved the conversion of NaAD to P2CMN by LarB, LarE-catalyzed anaerobic transformation of this substrate to P2TMN, synthesis of NPN from P2TMN by LarC, incorporation of the cofactor into LarA apoprotein from Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum (LarATt), and measurement of the resulting Lar activity (Fig. 8A). Anaerobic cluster-assembled LarETm exhibited the greatest activity, whereas significantly reduced levels were observed for anaerobically purified protein, and essentially no activity was detected by this assay in the aerobically purified sample. To further characterize the reaction, we examined different time intervals (Fig. 8B) as well as different concentrations of the cluster-assembled LarETm (Fig. 8C). We observed increasing levels of activity for the first 10 min of the reaction, but longer time periods led to a small reduction of activity. As expected, using larger amounts of LarETm led to greater levels of Lar activity; however, a linear dependence was not observed. As a means to potentially allow catalytic, rather than stoichiometric, activity of LarETm, we provided exogenous sulfur sources. Treating LarETm with L-cysteine and His6-tagged IscSEc provided a substantial increase in the levels of Lar activity (Fig. 8D). In contrast, provision of Na2S as an external sulfur source along with FeCl3 did not increase the level of Lar activity over the control (Fig. 8E). These results suggest that LarETm can use L-cysteine as sulfur donor when provided along with His6-tagged IscSEc, whereas Na2S does not serve as the sulfur source for the sulfur transferase activity of this enzyme.Figure 8Sulfur transferase activity of His6-tagged LarETm. LarETm samples were incubated at room temperature for the indicated time periods with P2CMN (prepared by LarBLp-catalyzed transformation of NaAD), 20 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM Mg·ATP, then denatured by heat treatment at 80 °C for 10 min. The activities of the LarETm samples were assessed by an indirect assay in which the LarETm product, P2TMN, was converted into NPN using LarCLp, the cofactor was incorporated into LarATt apoprotein, and Lar activity was monitored based on the production of D-lactate from 45 mM L-lactate in the starting solution. A, comparison of activities after 60 min incubation for three LarETm samples at 1 mM concentration: prepared aerobically, isolated anaerobically, and purified then subjected to anaerobic cluster-assembly conditions. B, time dependence of activity for cluster-assembled LarETm based on the subsequent conversion of P2TMN to NPN and activation of lactate racemase, monitoring D-lactate production. A low concentration of enzyme (10 μM) was used to allow for kinetic analysis. C, effect of the LarETm enzyme concentration on activity during 10 min of incubation as measured by the downstream Lar activity determination. D, effect of added L-Cys (10 mM) plus IscSEc (20 μM) on the activity of LarETm (1 mM) compared to the activity of enzyme with no sulfur supplementation during a 10 min incubation, as monitored by the resulting Lar activity. E, effect of added Na2S (10 mM) on the activity of LarETm (1 mM) compared to the activity of enzyme with no sulfur supplementation during a 10 min incubation, based on the observed Lar activity. The plots include individual data points, the means, and the SDs.

The three variant proteins were isolated aerobically, UV-vis absorption spectra were acquired (Fig. 9A), the samples were subjected to cluster assembly conditions, the modified spectra were acquired (Fig. 9B), and the variants were measured for enzymatic activity (Fig. 9C). The broad absorption peak at ∼410 nm was decreased, but not eliminated, for each of the variants as initially purified in comparison to the control protein at the same concentration (100 μM). On the basis of the A410/A280 ratios of the C92A, C95A, and C172A variant proteins and comparison to the WT enzyme, the relative amounts of [4Fe-4S] cluster present were approximately 48%, 54%, and 61%, respectively (Fig. 9A). After treatment of the proteins with cluster-assembly conditions, the samples were much more closely matched in their 410 nm absorption with slightly less in the C92A variant (Fig. 9B). The enzymatic activities of the cluster-assembled C92A, C95A, and C172A variants (assayed at 7.5 μM concentrations) were 63%, 64%, and 71% of that for the WT enzyme using the Lar assay, respectively (Fig. 9C). These activity experiments were performed at least twice and were also reproduced at different assay time periods. The results are consistent with the Cys92, Cys95, and Cys172 residues being ligands of the [4Fe-4S] cluster but indicate that cluster formation and substantial activity is retained even when one of these ligands is removed. The sequence alignment and the LarETm homology model show the presence of a fourth cysteine residue (Cys174) adjacent to the tri-Cys cluster. To examine whether Cys174 participates in enzymatic activity and whether it might substitute for Cys172 when that residue is altered, we created constructs that encode the C174A variant and the C172A/C174A double variant. As expected, C174A LarETm retained nearly all (84%) of the control protein activity, whereas the C172A/C174A protein possessed essentially the same Lar activity (59%) as the C172A single variant (Fig. 9C). We conclude that Cys174 is not important for LarETm activity. To further examine the role of the conserved cysteine residues (Cys92, Cys95, and Cys172) we generated all possible combinations of double variants as well as the triple variant. Greatly diminished levels of activity were observed for the double variants (Fig. 9C). For the C92A/C95A/C172A variant, the broad absorption peak at ∼410 nm (Fig. 9A) and the Lar activity (Fig. 9C) were nearly eliminated, confirming the critical role of these residues in LarETm activity. As indicated previously, the inclusion of His6-tagged IscSEc and L-cysteine greatly enhanced the activity of His6-tagged LarETm when assessed using the indirect Lar activation assay. This finding led us to consider whether IscSEc may donate sulfur to LarETm for subsequent incorporation into the cofactor. Genes encoding two cysteine desulfurases (tmari_1700 and tmari_1378) are located distant from that encoding LarETm (tmari_0968) in the T. maritima genome, with the product from tmari_1700 (IscSTm) sharing 40% sequence identity with IscSEc (155 matches out of 384 residues) (Fig. S4A). The crystal structure of IscSEc (Protein Data Bank ID: 3LVK) (Fig. S4B) was used to create a homology model of IscSTm (prepared by SWISS MODEL) (18Waterhouse A. Bertoni M. Bienert S. Studer G.

Esaki N. Bacterial cysteine desulfurases: their function and mechanisms.Appl. Microbiol. Biotechnol. 2002; 60: 12-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). We used small molecule LC-MS analysis to explore whether IscSEc can directly supply sulfur to LarETm for subsequent biosynthesis of the NPN cofactor in a manner similar to its reported roles during biosynthesis of other sulfur-containing cofactors such as iron-sulfur clusters, thiamin, and biotin (20Lauhon C.T.

We incubated the cluster-assembled His6-tagged LarETm (10 μM) with P2CMN, 20 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM ATP for 60 min inside the anaerobic chamber at room temperature (RT), then added anoxic IscSEc (100 μM) and L-cysteine (10 mM) for another 60 min. Equal volumes of buffer were added to a control sample (lacking L-cysteine and IscSEc) that was incubated for a total of 120 min. Analysis of the metabolites by LC-MS revealed a fourfold greater amount of P2TMN produced in the presence of IscSEc and L-cysteine (Fig. 10A). The results are shown as relative changes because no standards are available for P2CMN or P2TMN so the concentrations of substrate provided and product formed are not established. To confirm and extend this result, we varied the relative amount of P2CMN by adding one, two, and three equivalent volumes to the reactions during the 60 min incubation, while maintaining a constant concentration of LarETm (10 μM). The presence of IscSEc and L-cysteine led to clear increases in P2TMN production as more P2CMN substrate was provided, whereas in their absence, the production of P2TMN was very low at all levels of P2CMN provided (Fig. 10B).

Recently, we annotated the “orphan” enzyme ABHD14B (α/β-hydrolase domain containing protein # 14B) as a novel KDAC and showed this enzyme’s ability to transfer an acetyl-group from protein lysine residue(s) to coenzyme-A to yield acetyl-coenzyme-A, thereby, expanding the repertoire of this enzyme family. However, the role of ABHD14B in metabolic processes is not fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the role of this enzyme using mammalian cell knockdowns in a combined transcriptomics and metabolomics analysis. We found from these complementary experiments in vivo that the loss of ABHD14B results in significantly altered glucose metabolism, specifically the decreased flux of glucose through glycolysis and the citric acid cycle. Further, we show that depleting hepatic ABHD14B in mice also results in defective systemic glucose metabolism, particularly during fasting. Taken together, our findings illuminate the important metabolic functions that the KDAC ABHD14B plays in mammalian physiology and poses new questions regarding the role of this hitherto cryptic metabolism-regulating enzyme.

Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) are innate cellular mechanisms that tightly regulate many important physiological processes such as chromatin remodeling, transcription, DNA repair, cellular signaling, protein folding, autophagy, apoptosis, and central metabolic pathways (1Walsh C.T.

While >200 PTMs have been identified to date, only a handful of them have been thoroughly investigated (e.g., phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation) (1Walsh C.T. Garneau-Tsodikova S.

Protein lysine acetylation (PKAc) is the second most abundant PTM in cells (after phosphorylation) that was identified over half a century ago; yet, its widespread abundance and physiological importance have only been reported recently (4Verdin E.

Modulation of cellular processes by histone and non-histone protein acetylation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2022; 23: 329-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). PKAc was initially thought to be restricted only to histones or the enzymes acetylating them and were therefore monikered histone acetyltransferases (HATs) (8Allis C.D. Berger S.L. Cote J. Dent S.

Allis C.D. Histone acetyltransferases.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 81-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1562) Google Scholar). However, recent studies have shown that numerous nonhistone proteins are also acetylated by this enzyme class (7Shvedunova M. Akhtar A. Modulation of cellular processes by histone and non-histone protein acetylation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2022; 23: 329-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), and hence, the nomenclature for this enzyme family has been expanded to lysine acetyltransferase (KAT) (Fig. 1A) (8Allis C.D. Berger S.L. Cote J. Dent S. Jenuwien T. Kouzarides T. et al.New nomenclature for chromatin-modifying enzymes.Cell. 2007; 131: 633-636Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (726) Google Scholar). PKAc neutralizes the positive charge on protein lysine residue(s) (e.g., histones, transcription factors and regulators, and nuclear proteins/receptors) alters their protein–protein or protein–DNA interactions and in doing so, is thought to activate transcription by disrupting such interactions (10Narita T. Weinert B.T. Choudhary C. Functions and mechanisms of non-histone protein acetylation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 20: 156-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). PKAc has also been linked to the regulation of metabolism, as recent studies have shown that the activity of key enzymes involved in central metabolism (e.g., glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle, urea cycle, fatty acid β-oxidation, and glycogen metabolism) are spatiotemporally regulated and/or contextually modulated by this PTM (6Drazic A.

Lin Y. Zhang T. et al.Regulation of cellular metabolism by protein lysine acetylation.Science. 2010; 327: 1000-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (1400) Google Scholar). Given its abundance and unlike other PTMs, PKAc is reversible, and the removal of the acetyl group from lysine residue(s) via an amide bond cleavage is catalyzed by enzymes known as lysine deacetylases (KDACs) (Fig. 1A) (13Van Dyke M.W. Lysine deacetylase (KDAC) regulatory pathways: an alternative approach to selective modulation.ChemMedChem. 2014; 9: 511-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Counter to KATs, KDACs deacetylate histones and/or other nuclear proteins remodel the chromatin back into a heterochromatin state and are therefore thought to repress transcription (11Ali I.

The catalytic mechanisms of both these enzyme classes and the eventual fate of the acetyl group are quite distinct. The HDACs for example use a divalent metal cation (generally Zn2+) to activate a nucleophilic water molecule that hydrolyses the amide bond of an acetylated lysine residue to give free acetate as the product (13Van Dyke M.W.

Roles of histone deacetylases in epigenetic regulation: emerging paradigms from studies with inhibitors.Clin. Epigenetics. 2012; 4: 5Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). The sirtuins on the other hand are NAD+ dependent and yield nicotinamide and 2’/3′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose as the end products of the KDAC reaction (16Bheda P. Jing H. Wolberger C. Lin H.N. The substrate specificity of sirtuins.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2016; 85: 405-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Like KATs, KDACs also regulate important physiological processes like cell growth and differentiation, energy production, glucose and lipid metabolism, longevity, and organelle biogenesis (4Verdin E.

Given their physiological importance, deregulation in the cellular balance of KAT/KDAC activity has been linked to numerous human metabolic pathophysiological conditions like diabetes, obesity, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, cardiac hypertrophy, and autoimmunity (20Osborne B.

Recently, we annotated the orphan enzyme α/β-hydrolase domain containing protein # 14B (ABHD14B) as a novel KDAC, thus expanding this enzyme family’s repertoire (24Rajendran A. Vaidya K. Mendoza J.

Nearly 2 decades ago, the three-dimensional structure of human ABHD14B was solved, and a yeast two-hybrid screen identified this enzyme as an interactor of the HAT domain of the transcription factor TAFII250 (25Padmanabhan B.

Cravatt B.F. The metabolic serine hydrolases and their functions in mammalian physiology and disease.Chem. Rev. 2011; 111: 6022-6063Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). We recently showed that ABHD14B was able to transfer an acetyl group from posttranslationally modified protein lysine residue to coenzyme-A (CoA), thus making the biologically important acetyl-CoA (Fig. 1B) (24Rajendran A. Vaidya K. Mendoza J. Bridwell-Rabb J. Kamat S.S. Functional annotation of ABHD14B, an orphan serine hydrolase enzyme.Biochemistry. 2020; 59: 183-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Genetic knockdown of ABHD14B in mammalian cells showed significantly increased cellular PKAc and decreased cellular concentrations of acetyl-CoA, thus confirming our in vitro functional annotation to more physiological cellular setting (24Rajendran A. Vaidya K. Mendoza J. Bridwell-Rabb J. Kamat S.S. Functional annotation of ABHD14B, an orphan serine hydrolase enzyme.Biochemistry. 2020; 59: 183-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). What distinguishes ABHD14B from the HDACs and sirtuins are (i) the use of CoA as a co-substrate and the end fate of the acetyl group (formation of acetyl-CoA) and (ii) the catalytically conserved ping-pong mechanism conserved for all metabolic serine hydrolase enzymes (Fig. 1B) (24Rajendran A. Vaidya K. Mendoza J. Bridwell-Rabb J. Kamat S.S. Functional annotation of ABHD14B, an orphan serine hydrolase enzyme.Biochemistry. 2020; 59: 183-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). To investigate the physiological role of ABHD14B, we developed an exquisitely selective antibody against mammalian ABHD14B (24Rajendran A. Vaidya K. Mendoza J. Bridwell-Rabb J. Kamat S.S. Functional annotation of ABHD14B, an orphan serine hydrolase enzyme.Biochemistry. 2020; 59: 183-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) and surveyed the tissue distribution of ABHD14B in mice. Quite interestingly, this protein profiling study showed that ABHD14B had restricted expression only in the metabolically active tissues (liver and kidneys) (24Rajendran A. Vaidya K. Mendoza J. Bridwell-Rabb J. Kamat S.S. Functional annotation of ABHD14B, an orphan serine hydrolase enzyme.Biochemistry. 2020; 59: 183-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), leading us to hypothesize that this enzyme activity might be playing an important function in regulating metabolism and in turn cellular energetics. Following up on this study, here, we report an integrated, yet very complementary, transcriptomics, and metabolomics analysis in mammalian HEK293T cells, where ABHD14B expression is knocked down. These experiments together suggest that ABHD14B plays an important role in modulating glucose metabolism in cells and in turn also regulates cellular energetics. Further, from studies in mice, we find that disruption of hepatic ABHD14B especially during fasting, disturbs homeostatic systemic glucose metabolism, and in doing so, significantly alters the organismal energetic status. Taken together, our findings collectively establish for the first time, a link between (hepatic) ABHD14B and glucose metabolism in mammals. Preliminary studies have shown that by its putative interactions with the HAT domain of TAFII250, ABHD14B can regulate transcriptional activity in mammalian cells (25Padmanabhan B. Kuzuhara T. Adachi N. Horikoshi M. The crystal structure of CCG1/TAF(II)250-interacting factor B (CIB).J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9615-9624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We recently annotated ABHD14B as a novel KDAC, and other KDACs (e.g., sirtuins, HDACs) are known regulators of transcription and in turn metabolic activity in mammals. Given this precedence, we decided to perform a transcriptomics analysis in mammalian cells, where ABHD14B was depleted. We have previously shown that plasmids KD_2 and KD_3 produced robust and significant (>90%) knockdown of ABHD14B in mammalian HEK293T cells relative to a control nontargeting (NT) plasmid and chose this system for our transcriptomics studies (Fig. S1A) (24Rajendran A.

In this study, we also included untreated “wild-type” (WT) HEK293T cells as an additional control to negate any “off” targets of the control NT plasmid and enrich transcriptional changes specifically brought about specifically by the depletion of ABHD14B in this cell line. Using standard protocols, RNA was isolated from all these HEK293T cell lines (i.e., KD_2, KD_3, NT, and WT), and transcriptome analysis was performed using the Ilumina NextSeq platform as per manufacturer’s instructions (Fig. S1B). First, to ensure relatedness between samples of a particular HEK293T cell line (i.e., KD_2, KD_3, NT, and WT), after examining the raw reads (Fig. S1C), we performed a principal component analysis amongst all these samples (Fig. S1D) and found tight clustering of samples of a particular cell line, suggesting that a particular HEK293T cell line (i.e., KD_2, KD_3, NT, and WT) behaved like wise in the transcriptomics analysis. Next, we looked for the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the KD_2 and KD_3 HEK293T cell lines relative to WT HEK293T cells and found 1817 (1017 upregulated and 800 downregulated) and 1484 (841 upregulated and 643 downregulated) DEGs respectively that passed the set threshold (>1.5-fold change and adjusted p-value < 0.01) from this analysis (Fig. 2A and Table S1). Here, we also found that relative to WT HEK293T cells, NT-treated HEK293T cells also showed 1507 (832 upregulated and 675 downregulated) DEGs (Fig. S1E and Table S1), and therefore, we decided to remove such DEGs (off-targets of NT) from further analysis. For this, we assessed the DEGs data from all the HEK293T cell lines using a Venn diagram (Fig. 2B) and found a total of 743 genes (Table S1) that were differentially enriched (410 upregulated and 333 downregulated) in either KD_2 (375 genes, 205 upregulated and 170 downregulated) or KD_3 (168 genes, 91 upregulated and 77 downregulated) or both (200 genes, 114 upregulated and 86 downregulated) HEK293T cell line. Having shortlisted 743 putative DEGs from the aforementioned transcriptome analysis, leveraging publicly available (open-source) bioinformatics platforms, next, we wanted to identify the possible biological pathways that might be altered as a result of depleting the KDAC ABHD14B in HEK293T cells. Towards this, we first decided to perform a gene ontology (GO) survey and searched these 743 DEGs in the PANTHER classification system (http://www.pantherdb.org) (29Mi H. Ebert D. Muruganujan A. Mills C. Albou L.P. Mushayamaha T. et al.PANTHER version 16: a revised family classification, tree-based classification tool, enhancer regions and extensive API.Nucl. Acids Res. 2021; 49: D394-D403Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). From this analysis, we found that out of the 743 DEGs, 369 were annotated in the PANTHER classification database, while the remaining 374 DEGs were classified (or listed) as uncharacterized or unknown in this classification system (Table S1). Amongst the 369 DEGs annotated in PANTHER, we found that enzymes involved in central metabolic processes (81 genes, 30 upregulated and 51 downregulated) and transcriptional regulators modulating metabolic processes (41 genes, 33 upregulated and eight downregulated) were the most enriched class of genes (Fig. 2C). Several other proteins (or enzymes) involved in metabolic processes such as PTM modulating enzymes, protein activity modulators, and enzymes regulating nucleic acid metabolism (Fig. 2C and Table S1) were also represented in this GO study and suggested that ABHD14B might have a function in the regulation of metabolism. To avoid any database bias, we performed a similar GO analysis in the MGI database (http://www.informatics.jax.org) (30Bult C.J. Blake J.A. Smith C.L. Kadin J.A. Richardson J.E. Mouse Genome Database G. Mouse genome database (MGD) 2019.Nucl. Acids Res. 2019; 47: D801-D806Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) and found that of the 743 DEGs, a significant majority (329 genes, 178 upregulated and 151 downregulated) had putative roles to play in central metabolic processes and/or its regulation, especially glucose metabolism (Table S1). We performed a hierarchical clustering analysis of these 329 DEGs involved in metabolism from the GO search from the MGI database for all the replicates from the transcriptome analysis and found a significant change in their expression profiles in almost all the KD_2 or KD_3 HEK293T cell replicates relative to WT HEK293T cell replicates (Fig. 2D). Further, using Cytoscape (https://cytoscape.org) (31Shannon P. Markiel A. Ozier O. Baliga N.S. Wang J.T. Ramage D. et al.Cytoscape: a software environment for integrated models of biomolecular interaction networks.Genome Res. 2003; 13: 2498-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (22844) Google Scholar), we performed a biological network analysis on these 329 DEGs putatively involved in metabolism and found that cellular or primary metabolic processes (e.g., glycolysis, citric acid cycle) were the most overrepresented pathway annotation, followed by regulation of metabolic processes (Fig. 2E and Table S1). Finally, to validate the findings from the transcriptomics analysis, we performed a real-time qPCR experiment on a handful of DEGs and found from this experiment that these DEGs showed changes and trends similar to those observed from the transcriptomics analysis (Fig. S1F). Taken together, the transcriptomics study coupled with the GO and bioinformatics analysis from PANTHER and MGI database strongly suggest that ABHD14B regulates expression of numerous proteins, particularly enzymes involved in central metabolic processes, especially glucose metabolism and/or transcriptional regulators of primary metabolic processes. Since the transcriptomics analysis hinted at a role for ABHD14B in regulating cellular central metabolic pathways, we decided to perform a focused metabolomics analysis and determine if any metabolites and/or central pathways were altered in mammalian cells following ABHD14B depletion. Toward this, using established metabolite extraction and LC-MS/MS methods (Fig. S2A and Table S2) (32Kelkar D.S. Ravikumar G. Mehendale N. Singh S. Joshi A.

Mass Sp. 2007; 21: 2717-2726Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), we performed semi-quantitative untargeted (information-dependent acquisition) and/or targeted (multiple reaction monitoring) metabolomics analysis in KD_2 and KD_3 HEK293T cells, where ABHD14B was significantly knocked down relative to NT control. Like the transcriptomics analysis, in the metabolomics studies, untreated WT HEK293T cells were also used as an additional control, and metabolites analyzed from all treated cell lines (NT, KD_2, and KD_3) were normalized to WT HEK293T cells to ensure any “off” target effects were nullified in this metabolomics analysis. From this LC-MS/MS–based metabolomics analysis, the metabolites were considered as “hits” (significantly altered) if they passed the selection filter, i.e., a >1.5-fold change (increase or decrease) with a stringent p-value < 0.01, in both KD_2 and KD_3 groups relative to the NT control group. While we were able to confidently identify and semi-quantitate > 200 unique metabolites, only a few (∼30) passed the aforementioned selection filter and evaluated further (Fig. 3A). Corroborating the transcriptomics data, prominent among the altered metabolites, interestingly, were several key intermediates from the glycolysis pathway and TCA cycle (or citric acid cycle) that were significantly reduced in their cellular concentrations upon ABHD14B depletion in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3, A and B and Table S2). Among all the altered metabolites, the end intermediate and/or product of glycolysis, pyruvate, was the most substantially reduced in its cellular concentrations in both KD_2 (∼85%) and KD_3 (∼95%) groups (Fig. 3B), while another high energy glycolytic intermediate, 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG), was also significantly reduced by ∼50% in both KD_2 and KD_3 HEK293T cells (Fig. 3B). Further, we also found from this metabolomics analysis that downstream of glycolysis, several important TCA cycle intermediates namely, 2-ketoglutarate (2-KG) (or α-ketoglutarate), succinyl-CoA, fumarate, and malate were also consistently reduced in their cellular concentrations by 40 to 60% in both KD_2 and KD_3 HEK293T cells (Fig. 3B). Since the transcriptomics analysis suggested that ABHD14B was possibly involved in regulating expression of genes involved in central or primary metabolic pathways, we also looked in more detail at various other metabolites (e.g., amino acids, fatty acids, neutral and phospholipids) (Fig. 3C and Table S2). Here, we found that relative to most of the other central metabolic pathways, upon depletion of ABHD14B in HEK293T cells, glycolysis and TCA cycle were by far the most perturbed central (or primary) metabolic pathways, in that most metabolites of these pathways were significantly reduced in cellular concentrations. Interestingly, apart from the aforementioned metabolites (Fig. 3B and Table S2), we found that a few more intermediates on glycolysis and/or TCA cycle namely Co-A/acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate, along with some shunt and/or byproducts of these pathways (glyoxylate, lactate, and 2-hydroxyglutarate), all showed a consistent reduction (∼20–40%) in cellular concentration upon ABHD14B knock down, but did not pass the strict selection filters described earlier (Figs. 3C, S2B and Table S2). Besides glycolysis and the TCA cycle, we did not find any altered cellular levels for various amino acids, free fatty acids (saturated, monounsaturated or polyunsaturated), most phospholipids (phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylinositol), and all measured lysophospholipids as a result of ABHD14B depletion in HEK293T cells (Fig. 3C and Table S2). We did however notice that there was a modest increase (∼30–40%) in cellular triglycerides and abundant phospholipids (phosphatidyl-cholines and -ethanolamines) levels with a concomitant decrease in cellular cholesterol levels in HEK293T cells with depleted ABHD14B levels (Figs. 3C, S2B and Table S2). Finally, to validate the metabolomics data, we performed a complementary lactate production assay in all the HEK293T cell lines and found that the depletion of ABHD14B in HEK293T cells indeed resulted in depletion of cellular lac"

The All of Us database offers extensive survey data pertaining to social determinants that is not routinely available in electronic health records. This study assesses whether social determinants were associated with an increased risk of developing proliferative diabetic retinopathy or related complications (e.g. related diagnoses or procedures).We identified 729 adult participants in the National Institutes of Health All of Us Research Program data repository with diabetic retinopathy (DR) who answered survey questions pertaining to healthcare access and utilization. Electronic health record data regarding co-morbidities, laboratory values, and procedures were extracted. Multivariable logistic regression with bi-directional stepwise variable selection was performed from a wide range of predictors. Statistical significance was defined as p<0.05.The mean (standard deviation) age of our cohort was 64.9 (11.4) years. 15.2% identified as Hispanic or Latino, 20.4% identified as Black, 60.6% identified as White, and 19.3% identified as Other. 10-20% of patients endorsed several reasons for avoiding or delaying care, including financial concerns and lack of access to transportation. Additional significant social determinants included race and religion discordance between healthcare provider and patient (odds ratio [OR] 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.41, p = 0.03) and caregiver responsibilities toward others (OR 3.14, 95% CI 1.01-9.50, p = 0.04).Nationwide data demonstrate substantial barriers to healthcare access among DR patients. In addition to financial and social determinants, race and religion discordance between providers and patients may increase the likelihood of PDR and related complications."
https://openalex.org/W4282924105,"This study describes the prevalence of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) across different aspects of social isolation among adults 65 years or older.In this cross-sectional study, we utilized the Wave 3 data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP). MCI was defined as a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score less than 23. Prevalence of MCI was calculated for above and below average social disconnectedness (SD), perceived isolation (PI), and demographic variables age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, and household income.The overall prevalence [and 95% confidence interval] of MCI was 27.5% [25.5-29.6]. The high prevalence of MCI was found in those who had above average SD (32.0% [29.1-34.9]), above average PI (33.3% [29.7-36.8]), were older in age (43.1% [38.9-47.3]), male (28.7% [25.9-31.5]), Black (61.1% [52.5-69.6]), had less than a high school education (66.3% [58.9-73.8]), or were in the lowest income group (46.2% [39.7-52.7]). Those with above average SD or PI had a higher prevalence of MCI in almost all demographics, compared to those with below average SD or PI. Those who were Black or African American or had less than a high school education did not have a greater prevalence of MCI when SD was above average.This current study adds to the body of literature that links SD and PI to MCI and sheds light on the possible existing socio-demographic disparities. Groups with greater than average SD or PI tend to have a higher prevalence of MCI. Further studies are needed to establish a causal association of SD and PI with MCI."

Understanding how pandemics impact on medicine use can help policymakers act quickly to prevent harm. We quantified changes in dispensing of common medicines proposed for ""re-purposing"" due to their perceived benefits as therapeutic or preventive for COVID-19 in Australia.We performed an interrupted time series analysis and cross-sectional study using nationwide dispensing claims data (January 2017-November 2020). We focused on six subsidized medicines proposed for re-purposing: hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, ivermectin, colchicine, corticosteroids, and calcitriol (Vitamin D analog). We quantified changes in monthly dispensing and initiation trends during COVID-19 (March-November 2020) using autoregressive integrated moving average models and compared characteristics of initiators in 2020 and 2019.In March 2020, we observed a 99% (95%CI: 96%-103%) increase in hydroxychloroquine dispensing (approximately 22% attributable to new users), and a 199% increase (95%CI: 184%-213%) in initiation, with an increase in prescribing by general practitioners (42% in 2020 vs 25% in 2019) rather than specialists. These increases subsided following regulatory restrictions on prescribing. There was a small but sustained increase in ivermectin dispensing over multiple months, with an 80% (95%CI 42%-118%) increase in initiation in May 2020 following its first identification as potentially disease-modifying in April. Other than increases in March related to stockpiling, we observed no change in the initiation of calcitriol or colchicine during COVID-19. Dispensing of corticosteroids and azithromycin was lower than expected from April through November 2020.While most increases in dispensing observed early on during COVID-19 were temporary and appear to be related to stockpiling among existing users, we observed increases in the initiation of hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin and a shift in prescribing patterns which may be related to the media hype around these medicines. A quick response by regulators can help limit inappropriate repurposing to lessen the impact on medicine supply and patient harm."

https://openalex.org/W4282929592,"Prolonged or excessive stress negatively affects learning, behavior and health across the lifespan. To alleviate adverse effects of stress in school children, stressors should be reduced, and support and effective interventions provided. Animal-assisted interventions (AAI) have shown beneficial effects on health and wellbeing, however, robust knowledge on stress mediation in children is lacking. Despite this, AAIs are increasingly employed in settings world-wide, including schools, to reduce stress and support learning and wellbeing. This study is the first randomized controlled trial to investigate dog-assisted interventions as a mediator of stress in school children with and without special educational needs (SEN) over the school term. Interventions were carried out individually and in small groups twice a week for 20 minutes over the course of 4 weeks. We compared physiological changes in salivary cortisol in a dog intervention group with a relaxation intervention group and a no treatment control group. We compared cortisol level means before and after the 4 weeks of interventions in all children as well as acute cortisol in mainstream school children. Dog interventions lead to significantly lower stress in children with and without special educational needs compared to their peers in relaxation or no treatment control groups. In neurotypical children, those in the dog interventions showed no baseline stress level increases over the school term. In addition, acute cortisol levels evidenced significant stress reduction following the interventions. In contrast, the no treatment control group showed significant rises in baseline cortisol levels from beginning to end of school term. Increases also occurred in the relaxation intervention group. Children with SEN showed significantly decreased cortisol levels after dog group interventions. No changes occurred in the relaxation or no treatment control groups. These findings provide crucial evidence that dog interventions can successfully attenuate stress levels in school children with important implications for AAI implementation, learning and wellbeing."

The plant growth promoting traits such as siderophore, phytohormone, and hydrolytic enzymes production, and phosphate solubiliation were assessed. Eleven vermi-bacteria i.e. Bacillus mycoides, B. aryabhattai, B. megaterium, Staphylococcus hominis, B. subtilis, B. spizizenii, B. licheniformis, B. mojavensis, B. toyonensis, B. anthracis, B. cereus, B. thuringiensis, and B. paranthracis were isolated and identified based on microscopic studies, biochemical tests, ribotyping, and agricultural traits. All vermi-bacteria are Gram-positive rods except Staphylococcus hominis and produce different compounds such as siderophore, indole acetic acid, catalase, oxidase, proteases, amylases, and lipases. All vermi-bacteria also act as phosphate solubilizers. Therefore, all isolated vermi-bacteria could be used as potential microbial biofertilizers to enhance crops production in Pakistan."

Using the phonemic restoration paradigm, in which listeners are presented with ambiguous auditory input and report which word they hear, we conducted four online experiments with adult participants across the United States (combined N = 899). We find that the pandemic has reshaped language processing for the long term, changing how listeners process speech and what they expect from ambiguous input. These results show that abrupt changes in linguistic exposure can cause enduring changes to the language system."
https://openalex.org/W4282930458,"Crocus istanbulensis (B.Mathew) Rukšāns is one of the most endangered Crocus species in the world and has an extremely limited distribution range in Istanbul. Our recent field work indicates that no more than one hundred individuals remain in the wild. In the present study, we used genome skimming to determine the complete chloroplast (cp) genome sequences of six C. istanbulensis individuals collected from the locus classicus. The cp genome of C. istanbulensis has 151,199 base pairs (bp), with a large single-copy (LSC) (81,197 bp), small single copy (SSC) (17,524 bp) and two inverted repeat (IR) regions of 26,236 bp each. The cp genome contains 132 genes, of which 86 are protein-coding (PCGs), 8 are rRNA and 38 are tRNA genes. Most of the repeats are found in intergenic spacers of Crocus species. Mononucleotide repeats were most abundant, accounting for over 80% of total repeats. The cp genome contained four palindrome repeats and one forward repeat. Comparative analyses among other Iridaceae species identified one inversion in the terminal positions of LSC region and three different gene (psbA, rps3 and rpl22) arrangements in C. istanbulensis that were not reported previously. To measure selective pressure in the exons of chloroplast coding sequences, we performed a sequence analysis of plastome-encoded genes. A total of seven genes (accD, rpoC2, psbK, rps12, ccsA, clpP and ycf2) were detected under positive selection in the cp genome. Alignment-free sequence comparison showed an extremely low sequence diversity across naturally occurring C. istanbulensis specimens. All six sequenced individuals shared the same cp haplotype. In summary, this study will aid further research on the molecular evolution and development of ex situ conservation strategies of C. istanbulensis."

The neonatal transport system is quite undervalued in many sub Saharan countries, Tanzania included. This study assessed the pre referral care, transport process, ambulance characteristics, admission clinical status and outcomes of referred neonates at Muhimbili National Hospital Upanga, a tertiary facility in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.A descriptive cross sectional study with a longitudinal follow up was conducted from September 2020 to February 2021 including neonates referred to Muhimbili National Hospital. A structured questionnaire was used to collect demographic characteristics and transport factors including pre referral care extracted from the referral documents and through interviewing caregivers or escorting person/nurse. Ambulances were directly observed using a structured checklist on presence, absence and functionality of supportive equipment. All enrolled neonates had a clinical assessment at admission and 48 hours post admission to determine admission clinical status and 48 hours' clinical outcome as either survived/died.Out of the 348 neonates assessed during the study period, the median gestation age was 38 weeks (IQR 32, 39) with the mean birth weight of 2455 ± 938 g. Pre referral documentation showed that temperature was measured in 176 (57.1%), oxygen saturation and random blood glucose in only 143 (46.6%) and 116 (36.2%) neonates respectively. Ambulance was used as a means of transportation in 308 (88.5%) neonates. While no ambulance had an incubator only 7 (2.0%) neonates were kept on a Kangaroo Mother Care position. Monitoring enroute was done to only 94 (27%) of the transferred neonates with 169 (54.9%) of health care professionals escorting the neonates lacking training on essential newborn care. On arrival, 115 (33%) were hypothermic, 74 (21.3%) hypoxic, 30 (8.6%) with poor perfusion and 49 (14.1%) hypoglycemic. Hypothermic neonates had an increased chance of dying compared to those who were normothermic (OR = 2.09, 95% CI (1.05-4.20), p = 0.037). The chance of dying among those presenting with hypoxia was almost three times (OR = 2.88, 95%CI (1.44-5.74), p = 0.003) while those with poor perfusion was almost five times (OR = 4.76, 95%CI (1.80-12.58), p = 0.002). Additionally, neonates who had hyperglycemia (RBG > 8.3mmol/l) on arrival had a higher probability of dying compared to those who were euglycemic [(OR = 3.10, 95% CI (1.19-8.09) p = 0.021]. Overall mortality was 22.4% within 48 hours of admission and risk of dying increased as the presence of poor clinical status added on.Neonatal transportation in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania was observed to be challenging. Pre transfer care and monitoring during transportation was inadequate and this contributed to poor clinical status on admission. Hypothermia, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, hypoxia and poor perfusion on admission were associated with increased mortality. Effective referral network is needed for improved neonatal health outcomes. Pre referral supportive care, training of health care professionals, transportation with improved monitoring, clear communication protocol and referral documentation should be invested and effectively utilized."
https://openalex.org/W4282947228,"Over 1 million dogs are imported into the United States and roughly 340,000 dogs into the United Kingdom yearly. Although the official number of dogs arriving to Canada is currently unknown, local animal professionals estimate that thousands of dogs are imported into Canada each year. Dog importation may be increasing globally while regulation and surveillance are still limited, resulting in concerns for the health and welfare of imported dogs. To date, few studies have investigated how the source location of dogs influences the owner-dog relationship. The current report presents two independent studies that were conducted to assess whether owners of imported dogs reported a poorer owner-dog relationships compared to owners of Canadian-born dogs. In both studies, an online survey was distributed to dog owners (Study 1: n = 803; Study 2: n = 878) in British Columbia, Canada, containing questions on various aspects of the owner-dog relationship. The first study included questions from the Lexington Attachment to Pets Scale, Canine Behavioral Assessment and Research Questionnaire, Human-Animal Bond questionnaire, Monash Dog Owner Relationship Scale, and constructed questions about training methods, expectations, and health. The second study was comprised of original questions assessing difficult behaviour, training practices, health, attachment, and perceived level of burden of owning a dog. Both studies found no evidence of a poorer owner-dog relationship in non-Canadian-sourced dogs. In fact, owners of Canadian-sourced dogs used harsh training methods more frequently and had higher expectations for their dog. While no signs of poorer owner-dog relationship in non-Canadian-sourced dogs were found, future research should continue the investigation of age, health, and backgrounds of incoming dogs."
https://openalex.org/W4282971026,"While global food trade has allowed countries to buffer against domestic food production shortfalls and gain access to larger markets, engaging in trade has also opened economies up to shocks and increased extraction of food resources. With this research, we analyze how the global grain network influences country-level nourishment, while controlling for per capita land and food production. First, we model the trade network structure of the global wheat supply chain to measure the centrality or positionality of countries. We use spatial regression analysis to assess the impact of trade networks, volume, purchasing power, production capacity and geography on undernourishment. We find that the six countries most central to the global grain trade by betweenness and eigenvector centralities account for more than half of all wheat exports globally by volume. The centrality of these countries as opposed to volume of wheat produced or traded, determines their influence in the wheat supply chain network. The parametric component of our analysis confirms that trade, and centrality have significant implications for national levels of nourishment. Our findings suggest that for countries with low purchasing power, increasing centrality allows improvements in nourishment levels but for countries with very high purchasing power, increasing centrality can increase hunger outcomes. To counteract perturbations and shortfalls such as those being experienced currently in the globalized food system, local and regional governments may consider refocusing on regional and local based food systems."
https://openalex.org/W4282979647,"Environmental monitoring of microplastics (MP) contamination has become an area of great research interest, given potential hazards associated with human ingestion of MP. In this context, determination of MP concentration is essential. However, cheap, rapid, and accurate quantification of MP remains a challenge to this date. This study proposes a deep learning-based image segmentation method that properly distinguishes fluorescent MP from other elements in a given microscopy image. A total of nine different deep learning models, six of which are based on U-Net, were investigated. These models were trained using at least 20,000 patches sampled from 99 fluorescence microscopy images of MP and their corresponding binary masks. MP-Net, which is derived from U-Net, was found to be the best performing model, exhibiting the highest mean F1-score (0.736) and mean IoU value (0.617). Test-time augmentation (using brightness, contrast, and HSV) was applied to MP-Net for robust learning. However, compared to the results obtained without augmentation, no clear improvement in predictive performance could be observed. Recovery assessment for both spiked and real images showed that, compared to already existing tools for MP quantification, the MP quantities predicted by MP-Net are those closest to the ground truth. This observation suggests that MP-Net allows creating masks that more accurately reflect the quantitative presence of fluorescent MP in microscopy images. Finally, MAP (Microplastics Annotation Package) is introduced, an integrated software environment for automated MP quantification, offering support for MP-Net, already existing MP analysis tools like MP-VAT, manual annotation, and model fine-tuning."
https://openalex.org/W4281786253,"Epidermal growth factor-like domains (EGFDs) have important functions in cell–cell signaling. Both secreted and cell surface human EGFDs are subject to extensive modifications, including aspartate and asparagine residue C3-hydroxylations catalyzed by the 2-oxoglutarate oxygenase aspartate/asparagine-β-hydroxylase (AspH). Although genetic studies show AspH is important in human biology, studies on its physiological roles have been limited by incomplete knowledge of its substrates. Here, we redefine the consensus sequence requirements for AspH-catalyzed EGFD hydroxylation based on combined analysis of proteomic mass spectrometric data and mass spectrometry–based assays with isolated AspH and peptide substrates. We provide cellular and biochemical evidence that the preferred site of EGFD hydroxylation is embedded within a disulfide-bridged macrocycle formed of 10 amino acid residues. This definition enabled the identification of previously unassigned hydroxylation sites in three EGFDs of human fibulins as AspH substrates. A non-EGFD containing protein, lymphocyte antigen-6/plasminogen activator urokinase receptor domain containing protein 6B (LYPD6B) was shown to be a substrate for isolated AspH, but we did not observe evidence for LYPD6B hydroxylation in cells. AspH-catalyzed hydroxylation of fibulins is of particular interest given their important roles in extracellular matrix dynamics. In conclusion, these results lead to a revision of the consensus substrate requirements for AspH and expand the range of observed and potential AspH-catalyzed hydroxylation in cells, which will enable future study of the biological roles of AspH. Epidermal growth factor-like domains (EGFDs) have important functions in cell–cell signaling. Both secreted and cell surface human EGFDs are subject to extensive modifications, including aspartate and asparagine residue C3-hydroxylations catalyzed by the 2-oxoglutarate oxygenase aspartate/asparagine-β-hydroxylase (AspH). Although genetic studies show AspH is important in human biology, studies on its physiological roles have been limited by incomplete knowledge of its substrates. Here, we redefine the consensus sequence requirements for AspH-catalyzed EGFD hydroxylation based on combined analysis of proteomic mass spectrometric data and mass spectrometry–based assays with isolated AspH and peptide substrates. We provide cellular and biochemical evidence that the preferred site of EGFD hydroxylation is embedded within a disulfide-bridged macrocycle formed of 10 amino acid residues.

Epidermal growth factor-like domains (EGFDs) are common structural elements in secreted and cell surface–bound human proteins and are also present in the extracellular domains of transmembrane proteins, where they can be present as isolated domains or as an array of multiple (tandem) domains (1Campbell I.D.

EGFDs have important functions including in cell–cell signaling, blood clotting, and extracellular matrix formation, as evidenced by clinically observed mutations to EGFDs. Mutations in genes encoding for EGFDs of fibrillin-1 are associated with Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disorder (9Milewicz D.M. Braverman A.C. De Backer J. Morris S.A. Boileau C.

https://openalex.org/W4282568631,"Natural decisions involve two seemingly separable processes: inferring the relevant task (task-belief) and performing the believed-relevant task. The assumed separability has led to the traditional practice of studying task-switching and perceptual decision-making individually. Here, we used a novel paradigm to manipulate and measure macaque monkeys' task-belief and demonstrated inextricable neuronal links between flexible task-belief and perceptual decision-making. We showed that in animals, but not in artificial networks that performed as well or better than the animals, stronger task-belief is associated with better perception. Correspondingly, recordings from neuronal populations in cortical areas 7a and V1 revealed that stronger task-belief is associated with better discriminability of the believed-relevant, but not the believed-irrelevant, feature. Perception also impacts belief updating; noise fluctuations in V1 help explain how task-belief is updated. Our results demonstrate that complex tasks and multi-area recordings can reveal fundamentally new principles of how biology affects behavior in health and disease."
https://openalex.org/W4282920741,"Management of co-morbidities among persons living with HIV is an emerging priority, which may require additional medication over and above life-long antiretroviral therapy (ART). We explored factors associated with adherence to the trial drug among children and adolescents with perinatally acquired HIV taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the Bronchopulmonary Function in Response to Azithromycin Treatment for Chronic Lung Disease in HIV-Infected Children (BREATHE) trial.The BREATHE trial recruited 6-19 year olds with perinatally acquired HIV and co-morbid chronic lung disease as measured by FEV1. This two-site trial was individually randomised (1:1), double-blind and placebo-controlled. Participants received a once-weekly weight-based dose of 1-5 tablets of azithromycin (AZM: 250mg) or placebo, taken orally. We used pharmacy dispensing records and count of returned pills to measure adherence to study medication. Logistic regression was used to explore factors associated with adherence coverage. Poisson regression with Lexis expansion for time was used to explore whether adherence modified the effect of azithromycin on the incidence of acute respiratory exacerbation, a secondary outcome of the trial. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02426112.The 347 participants (median age 15.3, 51% male) consumed 14,622 doses of study medication over 16,220 person-weeks under study. Adherence was higher for those randomised to AZM (73.4%) than placebo (68.4%) and declined over the 48 weeks of the study (Score test for trend <0.02). Those with unsuppressed HIV viral load at baseline had 2.08 (95% CI: 1.19, 3.63) times the odds of non-adherence than those with viral suppression. Differences were also observed between trial sites.The majority of children and adolescents tolerated the addition of a once-weekly dose of medication to their pill burden. Barriers in adhering to treatment for co-morbid conditions are likely common to barriers in adhering to ART. Control of co-morbidities will therefore present additional challenges in HIV care."

Especially people with a low graph literacy are thought to be persuaded by graphs that misrepresent the underlying data. But we know little about how people interpret misleading graphs and how these graphs influence their opinions. In this study we focus on the effect of truncating the y-axis for a line chart which exaggerates an upgoing trend. In a randomized controlled trial, we showed participants either a normal or a misleading chart, and we did so in two different contexts. After they had seen the graphs, we asked participants their opinion on the trend and to give an estimation of the increase. Finally we measured their graph literacy. Our results show that context is the only significant factor in opinion-forming; the misleading graph and graph literacy had no effect. None of these factors had a significant impact on estimations for the increase. These results show that people might be less susceptible to misleading graphs than we thought and that context has more impact than a misleading y-axis."
https://openalex.org/W4282929376,"Antibiotics disrupt normal gut microbiota and cause dysbiosis, leading to a reduction in intestinal epithelial barrier function. Disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier, which is known as ""leaky gut"", results in increased intestinal permeability and contributes to the development or exacerbation of gastrointestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome. We have previously reported on a murine model of intestinal epithelial barrier dysfunction associated with dysbiosis induced by the administration of ampicillin and vancomycin. Saireito, a traditional Japanese herbal medicine, is often used to treat autoimmune disorders including ulcerative colitis; the possible mechanism of action and its efficacy, however, remains unclear. In this study, we examined the efficacy of Saireito in our animal model for leaky gut associated with dysbiosis. C57BL/6 mice were fed a Saireito diet for the entirety of the protocol (day1-28). To induce colitis, ampicillin and vancomycin were administered in drinking water for the last seven consecutive days (day22-28). As previously demonstrated, treatment with antibiotics caused fecal occult bleeding, cecum enlargement with black discoloration, colon inflammation with epithelial cell apoptosis, and upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Oral administration of Saireito significantly improved antibiotics-induced fecal occult bleeding and cecum enlargement by suppressing inflammation in the colon. Furthermore, Saireito treatment ensured the integrity of the intestinal epithelial barrier by suppressing apoptosis and inducing cell adhesion proteins including ZO-1, occludin, and E-cadherin in intestinal epithelial cells, which in turn decreased intestinal epithelial permeability. Moreover, the reduced microbial diversity seen in the gut of mice treated with antibiotics was remarkably improved with the administration of Saireito. In addition, Saireito altered the composition of gut microbiota in these mice. These results suggest that Saireito alleviates leaky gut caused by antibiotic-induced dysbiosis. Our findings provide a potentially new therapeutic strategy for antibiotic-related gastrointestinal disorders."

Children remain largely unvaccinated and are susceptible to infection, with studies reporting that they actively transmit the virus even when asymptomatic, thus affecting the community.We investigated if saliva is an effective sample for detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA and antibodies in children, and associated viral RNA levels to infectivity. For that, we used a saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test, preceded or not by RNA extraction, in 85 children aged 10 years and under, admitted to the hospital regardless of COVID-19 symptomatology. Amongst these, 29 (63.0%) presented at least one COVID-19 symptom, 46 (54.1%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 28 (32.9%) were under the age of 1, and the mean (SD) age was 3.8 (3.4) years. Saliva samples were collected up to 48 h after a nasopharyngeal swab-RT-qPCR test.In children aged 10 years and under, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of saliva-RT-qPCR tests compared to NP swab-RT-qPCR were, respectively, 84.8% (71.8%-92.4%), 100% (91.0%-100%), and 91.8% (84.0%-96.6%) with RNA extraction, and 81.8% (68.0%-90.5%), 100% (91.0%-100%), and 90.4% (82.1%-95.0%) without RNA extraction. Rescue of infectious particles from saliva was limited to CT values below 26. In addition, we found significant IgM positive responses to SARS-CoV-2 in children positive for SARS-CoV-2 by NP swab and negative by saliva compared to other groups, indicating late infection onset (>7-10 days).Saliva is a suitable sample type for diagnosing children aged 10 years and under, including infants aged <1 year, even bypassing RNA extraction methods. Importantly, the detected viral RNA levels were significantly above the infectivity threshold in several samples. Further investigation is required to correlate SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels to viral transmission."
https://openalex.org/W4282934339,"Do visible industrial accidents damage firms' reputations and depress their stock market returns, and do these penalties spill over to other firms in the industry? On April 20, 2010, the Deepwater Horizon offshore oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico leased by BP exploded and sank, causing 11 deaths and the largest marine oil spill in US history. We examine the impact of this accident on BP's reputation and stock market performance using data from YouGov's BrandIndex and Capital IQ's financial data for the period 2007-2017. We employ a synthetic control analysis to examine the extent and duration of these penalties. We find that in the aftermath of the Deepwater accident, BP's reputation declined by approximately 50% relative to the synthetic control, and this decline persisted through the end of 2017. Yet, in terms of financial market returns, though the stock price dropped drastically in the first two months, we do not find a statistically significant decline in the stock market returns either in the mid-term (1-2 years) or the long term (2-7 years). In terms of spillover effects, we find no evidence of reputational damage or a decline in stock market returns for other oil and gas firms. These findings suggest that while environmental accidents invite swift and lasting reputational penalties, they might not depress the stock market performance in the long run. Moreover, the impact either on reputation or stock market returns does not necessarily spill over to other firms in the same industry."

Secondary data were used, available in the Influenza Epidemiological Surveillance Information System (SIVEP-Gripe). Data were analyzed using the SPSS statistical program, medians were applied to present continuous variables and frequencies, and proportions were calculated for categorical variables, using logistic and multivariate regression analysis.The final study population included 3,585 pregnant and postpartum women, of whom 596 (16.6) were vaccinated: 443 (74.3%) received one dose and 153 (25.7%) received two doses. They were factors associated with non-vaccination against Covid-19 age ≤ 19 anos (OR: 2.57; IC95% 1.40;4.71), non-white women (OR: 1.34; IC95% 1.07;1.67) and those who required ventilatory support (OR: 1.51; IC95% 1.19;1.90) and invasive ventilation (OR: 2.05; IC95% 1.37;3.08).

However, the vast majority of these remote sensing cultural heritage monitoring efforts have been led and conducted by remote researchers, and there remains an urgent need to embed this work within existing, in-country institutions at local and regional levels. Here, we present the archaeological site monitoring approach and results from the project Archaeological Practice and Heritage Protection in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq , a collaborative project between the Sirwan Regional Project and Kurdish Iraqi archaeologists aimed at generating a fully functional and sustainable programme of archaeological site management co-created with, and managed by, Kurdish Iraqi archaeologists and antiquities officials. Between August 2018 and February 2020, 376 archaeological sites in the Sirwan/Upper Diyala River Valley region, located in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, were assessed for damage by Kurdish Iraqi archaeologists in collaboration with the Sirwan Regional Project. This work represents the first large-scale, systematic dataset of archaeological site conditions and longer-term damage in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI). Our results show that 86.7% of the assessed archaeological sites and 38.6% of the site surface area in this region were affected by damage between 1951–2018, and demonstrate the great urgency with which action must be taken to develop appropriate safeguarding measures for the KRI’s archaeological heritage. On the basis of these results, we outline relevant recommendations for the immediate protection of archaeological sites in Garmian and the greater Kurdistan Region."

The aim of this study was to investigate health service utilisation of mothers experiencing mental health problems and intimate partner violence ten years after having a first baby.Prospective cohort of 1507 first-time mothers recruited in Melbourne, Australia. Follow-up at ten years incorporated: Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Beck Anxiety Inventory, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist, Composite Abuse Scale.At ten years postpartum, one in four mothers (26.1%) reported depressive, anxiety or posttraumatic stress symptoms, and almost one in five (19.4%) reported recent IPV. Two-fifths of mothers reporting clinically significant mental health symptoms had experienced recent IPV (Odds Ratio = 5.6, 95% CI 3.9-8.1). Less than half of mothers experiencing mental health problems at ten-year follow-up had discussed their mental health with a general practitioner and around one in three had talked to a mental health professional. Two-thirds of mothers experiencing recent IPV had not disclosed this to a general practitioner or mental health professional.The findings highlight the extent to which many women deal with IPV and mental health problems without the support that primary health care and mental health care could provide and point to the need for more concerted efforts to strengthen health system responses to these frequently related issues."
https://openalex.org/W4282974282,"The circadian clock controls the physiological function of tissues through the regulation of thousands of genes in a cell-type-specific manner. The core cellular circadian clock is a transcription-translation negative feedback loop, which can recruit epigenetic regulators to facilitate temporal control of gene expression. Histone methyltransferase, mixed lineage leukemia gene 3 (MLL3) was reported to be required for the maintenance of circadian oscillations in cultured cells. Here, we test the role of MLL3 in circadian organization in whole animals. Using mice expressing catalytically inactive MLL3, we show that MLL3 methyltransferase activity is in fact not required for circadian oscillations in vitro in a range of tissues, nor for the maintenance of circadian behavioral rhythms in vivo. In contrast to a previous report, loss of MLL3-dependent methylation did not affect the global levels of H3K4 methylation in liver, indicating substantial compensation from other methyltransferases. Furthermore, we found little evidence of genomic repositioning of H3K4me3 marks. We did, however, observe repositioning of H3K4me1 from intronic regions to intergenic regions and gene promoters; however, there were no changes in H3K4me1 mark abundance around core circadian clock genes. Output functions of the circadian clock, such as control of inflammation, were largely intact in MLL3-methyltransferase-deficient mice, although some gene-specific changes were observed, with sexually dimorphic loss of circadian regulation of specific cytokines. Taken together, these observations indicate that MLL3-directed histone methylation is not essential for core circadian clock function; however, it may influence the inflammatory response."

In such challenging and worrying situations it can be expected that people will seek comfort in religion. However, before the pandemic there were never such wide world disruptions of religious practice-because of social distancing regulations, religiosity cannot be practiced in the same way as it was before the pandemic.Two anonymous online surveys were conducted of adult Poles, one during the second wave (N = 1072; November 2020) and one during the third wave of the pandemic (N = 1080; April 2021). The survey samples of participants reflected the Polish population structure in terms of age, sex, size of place of residence, education, and province.Participation in institutional religious practices fell threefold to 11.9% during the pandemic, as compared to pre-pandemic times (31.2%). The number of people who did not go to church at all increased from 23.1% to 57.0%. Between the second and third waves, there was a small return to regular practice (from 10.1% to 14.1%). Based on the subjective assessment of the amount of time devoted to prayer, fewer people reporting an increase (10.6%) than a decrease (20.1%) in religious commitment during the pandemic. Logistic regressions showed that an increase in religious commitment can be predicted by older age, more frequent participation in religious practices before the pandemic, and higher life satisfaction. A decrease in religious commitment can be predicted by younger age, less frequent participation in religious practices before the pandemic, and greater number of children in the household.Our research indicates a deintensification of religious practices during the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland. The pandemic has accelerated process of polarization of Polish religiosity."
https://openalex.org/W4282914523,"Because different sampling techniques will provide different abundance values, it is currently difficult to compare results among many studies to form holistic understandings of how abundance influences ant ecology. Using three sampling methods in the same location we found pitfall traps best confirmed yellow crazy ant A. gracilipes presence recording the fewest zero values (9.1%), card counts were the least reliable (67.1%), and tuna lures were intermediate (30.1%). The abundance of A. gracilipes from card counts ranged from 0 to 20, in pitfall traps from 0 to 325, and the full range of tuna lure abundance scores (0-7) were sampled. We then determined the relationships between these three standard ant sampling techniques for Anoplolepis gracilipes abundance. Irrespective of the data transformation method, the strongest relationship was between pitfall traps and tuna lures, and the least strong was between pitfall traps and card counts. We then demonstrate the utility of this knowledge by analysing A. gracilipes abundance reported within published literature to show where the populations in those studies sit on an abundance spectrum. We also comment on insights into the relative utility of the three methods we used to determine A. gracilipes abundance among populations of varying abundance. Pitfall traps was the most reliable method to determine if the species was present at the sample level. Tuna lures were predominantly reliable for quantifying the presence of workers, but were limited by the number of workers that can gather around a spoonful of tuna. Card counts were the quickest method, but were seemingly only useful when A. gracilipes abundance is not low. Finally we discuss how environmental and biological variation needs to be accounted for in future studies to better standardise sampling protocols to help progress ecology as a precision science."

To inform demand creation efforts, we examined sociodemographic characteristics and referral procedures associated with VMMC uptake in the Botswana Combination Prevention Project (BCPP) and examined the effectiveness of referral of men to MC services from HIV testing venues.BCPP was a community-randomized trial evaluating the impact of a combination HIV prevention package which included VMMC on community HIV incidence. We conducted a sub-analysis of VMMC uptake in intervention communities.During the initial VMMC campaign in 15 intervention communities, baseline male circumcision (MC) status was assessed among men eligible for HIV testing. Uncircumcised male community residents aged 16-49 years with negative/unknown HIV status were mobilized and linked to study VMMC services. Outcomes included MC baseline status and uptake through study services. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were performed to identify factors associated with MC uptake.Of 12,864 men eligible for testing, 50% (n = 6,448) were already circumcised. Among the uncircumcised men (n = 6,416), 10% (n = 635) underwent MC. Of the 5,071 men identified as eligible for MC through HIV testing services, 78% declined referral and less than 1% of those were circumcised. Of those accepting referral (n = 1,107), 16% were circumcised. Younger (16-24 years) (aOR: 1.51; 95%CI:1.22,1.85), unemployed men (aOR:1.34; 95%CI: 1.06,1.69), and those undergoing HIV testing at mobile venues (aOR: 1.88; 95%CI: 1.53,2.31) were more likely to get circumcised. Fear of pain was the most prevalent (27%) reason given for not being circumcised.Younger, unemployed men seeking HIV testing at mobile sites in Botswana were more likely to get VMMC. Addressing unique barriers for employed and older men may be necessary. Given the simplicity of VMMC as an intervention, the HIV testing programs offer a platform for identifying uncircumcised men and offering information and encouragement to access services."
https://openalex.org/W4282928775,"The early detection of traumatic brain injuries can directly impact the prognosis and survival of patients. Preceding attempts to automate the detection and the assessment of the severity of traumatic brain injury continue to be based on clinical diagnostic methods, with limited tools for disease outcomes in large populations. Despite advances in machine and deep learning tools, current approaches still use simple trends of statistical analysis which lack generality. The effectiveness of deep learning to extract information from large subsets of data can be further emphasised through the use of more elaborate architectures. We therefore explore the use of a multiple input, convolutional neural network and long short-term memory (LSTM) integrated architecture in the context of traumatic injury detection through predicting the presence of brain injury in a murine preclinical model dataset. We investigated the effectiveness and validity of traumatic brain injury detection in the proposed model against various other machine learning algorithms such as the support vector machine, the random forest classifier and the feedforward neural network. Our dataset was acquired using a home cage automated (HCA) system to assess the individual behaviour of mice with traumatic brain injury or non-central nervous system (non-CNS) injured controls, whilst housed in their cages. Their distance travelled, body temperature, separation from other mice and movement were recorded every 15 minutes, for 72 hours weekly, for 5 weeks following intervention. The HCA behavioural data was used to train a deep learning model, which then predicts if the animals were subjected to a brain injury or just a sham intervention without brain damage. We also explored and evaluated different ways to handle the class imbalance present in the uninjured class of our training data. We then evaluated our models with leave-one-out cross validation. Our proposed deep learning model achieved the best performance and showed promise in its capability to detect the presence of brain trauma in mice."
https://openalex.org/W4282929568,"Toxic metal exposure is a threat to green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) inhabiting and foraging in coastal seagrass meadows and are of particular concern in local bays of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), as numerous sources of metal contaminants are located within the region. Seagrass species tend to bioaccumulate metals at concentrations greater than that detected in the surrounding environment. Little is known regarding ecotoxicological impacts of environmental metal loads on seagrass or Chelonia mydas (C. mydas), and thus this study aimed to investigate and describe seagrass metal loads in three central GBR coastal sites and one offshore site located in the northern GBR. Primary seagrass forage of C. mydas was identified, and samples collected from foraging sites before and after the 2018/2019 wet season, and multivariate differences in metal profiles investigated between sites and sampling events. Most metals investigated were higher at one or more coastal sites, relative to data obtained from the offshore site, and cadmium (Cd), cobalt (Co), iron (Fe) and manganese (Mn) were found to be higher at all coastal sites. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) found that metal profiles in the coastal sites were similar, but all were distinctly different from that of the offshore data. Coastal foraging sites are influenced by land-based contaminants that can enter the coastal zone via river discharge during periods of heavy rainfall, and impact sites closest to sources. Bioavailability of metal elements are determined by complex interactions and processes that are largely unknown, but association between elevated metal loads and turtle disease warrants further investigation to better understand the impact of environmental contaminants on ecologically important seagrass and associated macrograzers."
https://openalex.org/W4282931239,"Background The available data are not sufficient to understand the clinical impact of statin intensity in elderly patients who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) due to acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Methods Using the COREA-AMI registry, we sought to compare the clinical impact of high- versus low-to-moderate-intensity statin in younger (&lt;75 years old) and elderly (≥75 years old) patients. Of 10,719 patients, we included 8,096 patients treated with drug-eluting stents. All patients were classified into high-intensity versus low-to-moderate-intensity statin group according to statin type and dose at discharge. The primary end point was target-vessel failure (TVF), a composite of cardiovascular death, target-vessel MI, or target-lesion revascularization (TLR) from 1 month to 12 months after index PCI. Results In younger patients, high-intensity statin showed the better clinical outcomes than low-to-moderate-intensity statin (TVF: 79 [5.4%] vs. 329 [6.8%], adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59–0.99; P = 0.038). However, in elderly patients, the incidence rates of the adverse clinical outcomes were similar between two statin-intensity groups (TVF: 38 [11.4%] vs. 131 [10.6%], aHR 1.1; 95% CI 0.76–1.59; P = 0.63). Conclusions In this AMI cohort underwent PCI, high-intensity statin showed the better 1-year clinical outcomes than low-to-moderate-intensity statin in younger patients. Meanwhile, the incidence rates of adverse clinical events between high- and low-to-moderate-intensity statin were not statistically different in elderly patients. Further randomized study with large elderly population is warranted."
https://openalex.org/W4282933560,"Untargeted metabolomics of blood samples has become widely applied to study metabolic alterations underpinning disease and to identify biomarkers. However, understanding the relevance of a blood metabolite marker can be challenging if it is unknown whether it reflects the concentration in relevant tissues. To explore this field, metabolomic and lipidomic profiles of plasma, four sites of adipose tissues (ATs) from peripheral or central depot, two sites of muscle tissue, and liver tissue from a group of nondiabetic women with obesity who were scheduled to undergo bariatric surgery (n = 21) or other upper GI surgery (n = 5), were measured by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Relationships between plasma and tissue profiles were examined using Pearson correlation analysis subject to Benjamini-Hochberg correction. Plasma metabolites and lipids showed the highest number of significantly positive correlations with their corresponding concentrations in liver tissue, including lipid species of ceramide, mono- and di-hexosylceramide, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), lysophosphatidylethanolamine, dimethyl phosphatidylethanolamine, ether-linked PC, ether-linked PE, free fatty acid, cholesteryl ester, diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol, and polar metabolites linked to several metabolic functions and gut microbial metabolism. Plasma also showed significantly positive correlations with muscle for several phospholipid species and polar metabolites linked to metabolic functions and gut microbial metabolism, and with AT for several triacylglycerol species. In conclusion, plasma metabolomic and lipidomic profiles were reflective more of the liver profile than any of the muscle or AT sites examined in the present study. Our findings highlighted the importance of taking into consideration the metabolomic relationship of various tissues with plasma when postulating plasma metabolites marker to underlying mechanisms occurring in a specific tissue."
https://openalex.org/W4282936599,"According to the latest round of National Family Health Survey-4 (NFHS (2015-16)) maternal and child health care (MCH) services improved drastically compared to NFHS-3. Previous studies have established that the uptake of MCH services increases the likelihood of early adoption of contraceptives among women. So, our study aims to examine if the early initiation of contraceptive has proportionately improved with the recent increase in MCH services.This study used the reproductive calendar of NFHS-4, 2015-16, to evaluate contraceptive initiation within 12 months after the last birth among 1,36,962 currently married women in India. A complementary log-log regression model was created to examine the link between the time of initiation of contraception and MCH care at the national level.It was found that only a quarter of women within 12 months from last birth have adopted the modern contraceptive method. Among those majority of the females adopted sterilization mostly at the time of birth. The multivariable model identified, that the period of initiation of contraceptive depends on the gender composition of children and access to MCH services. It was found that the odds of early initiation of contraceptive use was higher when a women have only son (AOR = 1.15,95% CI- 1.22, 1.18) compared to women with only daughter. Also, it was found that women who have availed MCH services were more likely to adopt contraceptives earlier.The number of women availing MCH services has increased in India, but it did not result in a proportional increase in initiation of contraception after childbirth. Facilitating family planning services alongside MCH services will be beneficial in low-resource settings. It is a golden opportunity to educate and encourage women for early adoption of contraceptive."
https://openalex.org/W4282942335,"The suitability of Madrid as the capital of Spain is analyzed from different perspectives, questioning the belief that this choice was eminently personal or political but lacked economic rationality. The paper analyzes Madrid's advantages over other possible capitals from the point of view of both intrinsic characteristics and those that depend on the transport network, such as the problem of supplies or the impact on the development of the surrounding territory. To deal with these questions it is necessary to consider logistical aspects that require an adjusted view of the existing transport network at that time. Using little-known primary sources and a novel methodology based on Delaunay triangulation, the 16th century Spanish transport network is reconstructed with a much higher level of accuracy than ever before. With this information, two maps are prepared that could be used for logistical analysis from a complex network perspective. The first map evaluates the real effects of the choice using an adjusted representation of the territory whilst the second map aims at avoiding the common fallacy of judging decisions made in the past applying current geographical know-how. This map, constructed with the planimetry of the 16th century, indicates how the somewhat deficient knowledge of Philip II with respect to the geographical reality of the day may have favored the choice of Madrid over Toledo, converting some Mediterranean coastal cities into more attractive options. The choice of Madrid as capital appears to be very reasonable in view of the different criteria used. Regarding supply difficulties, our results depart from traditional inclinations by deliberating the fact that the absence of a port in Madrid does not pose an insuperable problem. The latter is the case given that the advantages of maritime transport are far fewer than those usually considered, with Madrid's geographical position offering significant advantages in terms of road transport."
https://openalex.org/W4282967884,"Introduction Data integration is the process of merging information from multiple datasets generated from different sources, which can obtain more information in comparison to to one data source. All diagnostic medical radiation workers were enrolled in National Dose Registry (NDR) from 1996 to 2011, linked with mortality and cancer registry data. ( https://kdca.go.kr/ ) Survey was conducted during 2012-2013 using self-reported questionnaire on occupational radiation practices among diagnostic medical radiation workers. Methods Data integration of NDR and Survey was performed using the multivariate imputation by chained equations (MICE) algorithm. Results The results were compared by sex and type of job because characteristics of target variables for imputation depend on these variables. There was a difference between the observed and pooled mean for the frequency of interventional therapy for nurses due to different type of medical facility distribution between observed and completed data. Concerning the marital status of males and females, and status of pregnancy for females, there was a difference between observed and pooled mean because the distribution of the year of birth was different between the observed and completed data. For lifetime status of smoking, the percentage of smoking experience was higher in the completed data than in the observed data, which could be due to reasons, such as underreporting among females and the distribution difference in the frequency of drinking between the observed and completed data for males. Conclusion Data integration can allow us to obtain survey information of NDR units without additional surveys, saving us time and costs for the survey."
https://openalex.org/W4282937279,"Human communication relies heavily on pragmatic competence. Speech utterances are often ambiguous requiring listeners to use interaction history, shared knowledge, presumed intention and other contextual variables to make inferences about a speaker’s meaning. To probe the evolutionary origins of pragmatic competence we tested whether bonobos ( Pan paniscus ) can make inferences about the type of food available from listening to other group members’ food calls. We trained two group members to either prefer blue or pink chow and demonstrated these preferences to observers. A third group member served as an untrained control. In playback experiments, we broadcast the food calls of a trained demonstrator and the untrained group member to investigate whether subjects were able to infer which coloured chow was most likely available, based on the callers’ trained food preferences or lack thereof. As predicted, when hearing the untrained group member’s calls, subjects did not exhibit a bias, whereas they responded with a significant foraging bias when hearing a trained group member’s calls. These findings suggest that bonobos may take into account the idiosyncratic food preferences of others, although subjects probably differed in what they remembered."
https://openalex.org/W4282942438,"During the third millennium BC, Mesopotamia (the land between the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, in modern Iraq-Syria), was dominated by the world's earliest cities and states, which were ruled by powerful elites. Ur, in present-day southern Iraq, was one of the largest and most important of these cities, and irrigation-based agriculture and large herds of domesticated animals were the twin mainstays of the economy and diet. Texts suggest that the societies of the Mesopotamian city-states were extremely hierarchical and underpinned by institutionalised and heavily-managed farming systems. Prevailing narratives suggest that the animal management strategies within these farming systems in the third millennium BC were homogenous. There have been few systematic science-based studies of human and animal diets, mobility, or other forms of human-animal interaction in Mesopotamia, but such approaches can inform understanding of past economies, including animal management, social hierarchies, diet and migration. Oxygen, carbon and strontium isotopic analysis of animal tooth enamel from both royal and private/non-royal burial contexts at Early Dynastic Ur (2900-2350 BC) indicate that a variety of herd management strategies and habitats were exploited. These data also suggest that there is no correlation between animal-management practices and the cattle found in royal or private/non-royal burial contexts. The results demonstrate considerable divergence between agro-pastoral models promoted by the state and the realities of day-to-day management practices. The data from Ur suggest that the animals exploited different plant and water sources, and that animals reared in similar ways ended up in different depositional contexts."
https://openalex.org/W4282946767,"The study was conducted using a mixed methods approach combining lesson observations and interviews with teachers. A total of 204 hours of observation in 34 classes of 7th and 8th graders (aged 13–14 in the Polish primary school system) were conducted to investigate teachers’ behaviour that may exacerbate gender stereotypes and gender bias in the classroom. Moreover, the 25 female teachers conducting the observed lessons were interviewed to identify: (i) teachers’ awareness of stereotypical behaviours of girls and boys during classes; (ii) teachers’ awareness of possible causes of these behaviours; (iii) teachers’ responses to these behaviours, including actions that could deepen gender stereotypes; and (iv) teachers’ sensitivity to the gender polarised content of school textbooks. The results of the study show that teachers, although they are aware of the existence of gender stereotypes and declare their willingness to counteract them, tend to strengthen rather than eliminate these stereotypes with the strategies and actions undertaken. They have difficulty recognising possible reasons for the occurrence of stereotypical student behaviour and have little awareness of the gender-polarised content of school textbooks. The results of the study are discussed, inter alia, in light of the concept of the vicious circle of stereotypes and self-fulfilling prophecies in education."
https://openalex.org/W4282967201,"Objectives Malnutrition, defined according to Nutritional risk screening (NRS 2002), is commonly observed in patients of Myasthenia gravis (MG), a neuromuscular disorder manifested by varied degrees of skeletal muscle weakness. Because biochemical composition of saliva changes in correspondence to alterations in nutritional status, we tested our hypothesis that a certain saliva component(s) might serve as a biomarker(s) for nutrition status of MG, particularly for those MG patients with high risk of malnutrition. Materials and methods 60 MG patients and 60 subjects belonging to the healthy control group (HCG) were enrolled in this case-control study. The salivary α-amylase (sAA) activity, salivary flow rate (SFR), pH, total protein density (TPD), and the concentrations of chloride and calcium ions in MG group with or without malnutrition were measured before and after citric acid stimulation. Thereafter, the relationship between sAA activity and BMI was determined in MG and HCG. Results Compared with HCG, more patients with malnutrition, increased TPD and chloride and calcium concentrations but decreased pH value and SFR both before and after acid stimulation, as well as reduced sAA activity, pH and TPD responses to acid stimulation. MG with malnutrition showed decreased sAA activity and TPD responding to acid stimulation compared with those without malnutrition. Compared with normal BMI, sAA activity response to acid stimulation was reduced in low BMI. There was a significant strong positive correlation between the ratio of sAA activity and BMI in MG. Conclusions Salivary biochemical characteristics are abnormally altered in MG with malnutrition. Altered sAA activity responding to acid stimulation was associated with malnutrition. Clinical relevance Decreased sAA activity responding to acid stimulation can reflect malnutrition state and may be one potential screening marker for MG patients with high risk of malnutrition."
https://openalex.org/W4282967937,"A molecular genetic and morphometric investigation revealed the supposedly widespread Caribbean and Western Atlantic intertidal oribatid mite species Fortuynia atlantica to comprise at least two different species. Although there are no distinct morphological differences separating these taxa, COI and 18S sequence divergence data, as well as different species delimitation analyses, clearly identify the two species. Fortuynia atlantica is distributed in the northern Caribbean and the Western Atlantic and the new Fortuynia antillea sp. nov. is presently endemic to Barbados. Vicariance is supposed to be responsible for their genetic diversification and stabilizing selection caused by the extreme intertidal environment is suggested to be the reason for the found morphological stasis. The genetic structure of Fortuynia atlantica indicates that Bermudian populations are derived from the northern Caribbean and thus support the theory of dispersal by drifting on the Gulf Stream. Haplotype network data suggest that Bermudian and Bahamian populations were largely shaped by colonization, expansion and extinction events caused by dramatic sea level changes during the Pleistocene. A preliminary phylogenetic analysis based on 18S gene sequences indicates that the globally distributed genus Fortuynia may be a monophyletic group, whereas Caribbean and Western Atlantic members are distinctly separated from the Indo-Pacific and Western Pacific species."
