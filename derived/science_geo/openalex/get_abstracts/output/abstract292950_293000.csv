https://openalex.org/W2061936519,"Simulations of carbon storage suggest that conversion of old-growth forests to young fast-growing forests will not decrease atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO(2)) in general, as has been suggested recently. During simulated timber harvest, on-site carbon storage is reduced considerably and does not approach old-growth storage capacity for at least 200 years. Even when sequestration of carbon in wooden buildings is included in the models, timber harvest results in a net flux of CO(2) to the atmosphere. To offset this effect, the production of lumber and other long-term wood products, as well as the life-span of buildings, would have to increase markedly. Mass balance calculations indicate that the conversion of 5 x 10(9) to 1.8 x 10(9) megagrams of carbon to the atmosphere."
https://openalex.org/W1982175253,"Current issues and problems in the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of diamond are those which relate to its characterization, its nucleation on foreign surfaces, the question of its formation in preference to the other phases of solid carbon (for example, graphite, chaoite, or lonsdaleite), why different morphologies and crystallographic orientations (textures) are seen in different experiments or with different parameters in the same experiment, and finally whether well-crystallized metastable phases can be obtained by CVD in other material systems or are only a peculiarity of carbon chemistry. Whether a given carbon coating is justly described as diamond has been such an issue, and coatings should clearly show evidence for diamond by x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy before the claim of diamond is made. Experimental results have not been consistent in many cases, and much work remains to be done before an accurate assessment can be made of the technological impact of the development."
https://openalex.org/W2013798200,"Nanoparticulate metals and semiconductors that have atomic arrangements at the interface of molecular clusters and ""infinite"" solid-state arrays of atoms have distinctive properties determined by the extent of confinement of highly delocalized valence electrons. At this interface, the total number of atoms and the geometrical disposition of each atom can be used to significantly modify the electronic and photonic response of the medium. In addition to teh novel inherent physical properties of the quantum-confined moieties, their ""packaging"" into nanocomposite bulk materials can be used to define the confinement surface states and environment, intercluster interactions, the quantum-confinement geometry, and the effective charge-carrier density of the bulk. Current approaches for generating nanostructures of conducting materials are briefly reviewed, especially the use of three-dimensional crystalline superlattices as hosts for quantum-confined semiconductor atom arrays (such as quantum wires and dots) with controlled inter-quantum-structure tunneling."
https://openalex.org/W1975255398,"The crystal structures of the known copper oxide superconductors are described, with particular emphasis on the manner in which they fall into structural families. The local charge picture, a framework for understanding the influence of chemical composition, stoichiometry, and doping on the electrical properties of complex structures, is also described."
https://openalex.org/W1973819895,"Chemical bonding in solids is not completely understood, mainly because of the wide variation in the chemical properties of the elements. Many difficult challenges remain in predicting the composition, structure, and the properties of new materials. Consequently, the synthesis of novel solids is as much an art as a science. Discoveries of new compounds and structure types highlight the versatility that nature has allowed with the relatively small number of elements. This article explores the long-term challenges in solid-state chemistry and then focuses on efforts at Cornell to prepare new solids."
https://openalex.org/W1980267221,"Electrides are ionic compounds that have alkali metal cations complexed by a crown ether or cryptand, with trapped electrons as counterions. The crystal structures and properties of two electrides illustrate the diversity that is encountered. One Cs(+) (18-crown-6)(z)e(-), has relatively isolated, trapped electrons apparently centered at each anionic site. It has a low conductivity consistent with electron localization, with an activation energy for conductivity of at least 0.45 electron volt. The other, K(+) (cryptand[2.2.2])e(-), has electron pairs trapped in an elongated cavity in a singlet ground state, but there is also a thermally accessible paramagnetic state available. This electride is much more conducting, with an activation energy of only 0.02 electron volt."
https://openalex.org/W1994735752,"Recent phylogenetic studies and fossil finds support a new view of the ancestral angiosperm. A diminutive fossil angiosperm from the Aptian of Australia has attached leaves, with intermediate pinnate-palmate, low-rank venation, and lateral axes bearing pistillate organs subtended by bracts and bracteoles that are the oldest direct evidence of flowers. A variety of data suggests a similar morphology for the ancestral angiosperm. This hypothesis explains similarities between rhizomatous to herbaceous Magnoliidae and basal monocots, scarcity of early agniosperm wood, and lack of recognition of earlier remains."
https://openalex.org/W2045728074,"Recognition that organic solids possess some of the largest all-optical nonlinearities of all known materials has resulted in an interdisciplinary effort directed at both the basic understanding and exploitation of these effects. Parallel efforts on ionrganic semiconductors have already reached a mature stage whereby the origin of the effects, together with the prospects for device applications, are well known and appreciated. In this article, a unified picture of nonlinear optical phenomena in both classes of materials is presented. The specific implications for organic-based optical devices are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2091988638,"The tetragonal garnet (Mg,Fe)SiO(3) is a high-pressure phase of pyroxene that is thought to be a major constituent of the earth's upper mantle. Its crystal structure is similar to that of cubic garnet, but it is slightly distorted to tetragonal symmetry so that its x-ray powder diffraction pattern shows a very small line splitting. A suite of tetragonal garnets with different compositions in the MgSiO(3)-rich portion of the MgSiO(3)-FeSiO(3) system was synthesized at about 20 gigapascals and 2000 degrees C. The lattice parameters a and c of quenched samples were determined by whole-powder-pattern decomposition analysis of Fe Kalpha x-ray powder diffraction data, which has the capacity to resolve to a high degree heavily overlapping reflections. It was found that the lattice parameters can be obtained from the following equations; a (in angstroms) = 11.516 + 0.088x and c (in angstroms) = 11.428 + 0.157x, where x, teh mole fraction of FeSiO(3), is 0.0 </= x </= 0.2."
