Zn2+ precipitates Aβ in vitro, and Cu2+ interaction with Aβ promotes its neurotoxicity, correlating with metal reduction and the cell-free generation of H2O2 (Aβ1–42 > Aβ1–40 > ratAβ1–40). Because Zn2+ is redox-inert, we studied the possibility that it may play an inhibitory role in H2O2-mediated Aβ toxicity. In competition to the cytotoxic potentiation caused by coincubation with Cu2+, Zn2+ rescued primary cortical and human embryonic kidney 293 cells that were exposed to Aβ1–42, correlating with the effect of Zn2+ in suppressing Cu2+-dependent H2O2formation from Aβ1–42. Since plaques contain exceptionally high concentrations of Zn2+, we examined the relationship between oxidation (8-OH guanosine) levels in AD-affected tissue and histological amyloid burden and found a significant negative correlation. These data suggest a protective role for Zn2+in AD, where plaques form as the result of a more robust Zn2+ antioxidant response to the underlying oxidative attack.

Alzheimer's disease 8-OH guanosine buthionine sulfoximine Dulbecco's minimum essential medium tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride phosphate-buffered saline metallothionein Amyloid-β protein (Aβ; 39–43 amino acid residues, ≈4 kDa) is the main constituent of neuritic and diffuse plaques and also cerebrovascular amyloid deposits that characterize the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD)1(1.Glenner G.G. Wong C.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 885-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (4225) Google Scholar, 2.Kang J. Lemaire H.G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Muller-Hill B. Nature. 1987; 325: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3951) Google Scholar). Both Aβ deposition in the neocortex, and oxidative stress, are considered to be closely related to the pathogenesis of AD (3.Atwood C.S. Huang X. Moir R.D. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. Metal Ions Biol. Syst. 1999; 36: 309-364PubMed Google Scholar). The deposition of Aβ in the neocortex of overexpressing transgenic mice is accompanied by oxidative damage (4.Smith M.A. Hirai K. Hsiao K. Pappolla M.A. Harris P. Siedlak S. Tabaton M. Perry G. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 2212-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar). However, the biochemistry linking Aβ pathology to oxidative damage in AD is still unclear. We have recently found that the neurotoxicity of Aβ is mediated by the cell-free generation of H2O2 by the peptide when it binds catalytic amounts of Cu2+ (5.Huang X. Cuajungco M.P. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Tyndall J. Hanson G.R. Stokes K.C. Leopold M. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Saunders A.J. Lim J. Moir R.D. Glabe C. Bowden E.F. Masters C.L. Fairlie D.P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37111-37116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). This happens because Aβ is strongly redox-active, reducing Cu2+ and Fe3+ to Cu+ and Fe2+, respectively, and subsequently recruiting O2 as the substrate for H2O2 formation (6.Huang X. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Cuajungco M.P. Gray D.N. Lim J. Moir R.D. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7609-7616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). The rank order for toxicity, metal reduction, and H2O2 formation is Aβ1–42 > Aβ1–40 ≫ rat Aβ1–40 (5.Huang X. Cuajungco M.P. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Tyndall J. Hanson G.R. Stokes K.C. Leopold M. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Saunders A.J. Lim J. Moir R.D. Glabe C. Bowden E.F. Masters C.L. Fairlie D.P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37111-37116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar), in concordance with the participation of the respective peptide in amyloid pathology (2.Kang J. Lemaire H.G. Unterbeck A. Salbaum J.M. Masters C.L. Grzeschik K.H. Multhaup G. Beyreuther K. Muller-Hill B. Nature. 1987; 325: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (3951) Google Scholar, 7.Vaughan D.W. Peters A. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1981; 40: 472-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Since Cu2+ and Fe3+ are enriched in AD neuropil, and especially in plaque deposits (8.Lovell M.A. Robertson J.D. Teesdale W.J. Campbell J.L. Markesbery W.R. J. Neurol. Sci. 1998; 158: 47-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1812) Google Scholar), and since H2O2 is a freely permeable substrate for oxidation reactions, our findings support the possibility that Aβ interaction with redox active metal ions is a significant source of oxidative stress in AD. Despite being a striking feature of AD neuropathology, there is no evidence to link histological plaque amyloid directly to cell demise in AD. Amyloid plaque load has been reported not to correlate with the progression of the dementia (9.Hyman B.T. Marzloff K. Arriagada P.V. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1993; 52: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), possibly because there is no correlation between total Aβ load in neocortex and histological plaque count (10.McLean C. Cherny R. Fraser F. Fuller S. Smith M. Beyreuther K. Bush A. Masters C. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 46: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Conversely, a significant correlation is observed between neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic changes, and elevated levels of soluble Aβ in the AD-affected neocortex (10.McLean C. Cherny R. Fraser F. Fuller S. Smith M. Beyreuther K. Bush A. Masters C. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 46: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Indeed, modified soluble forms of Aβ1–42 extracted from AD brain have been shown to possess enhanced toxicity (11.Roher A.E. Chaney M.O. Kuo Y.M. Webster S.D. Stine W.B. Haverkamp L.J. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Tuohy J.M. Krafft G.A. Bonnell B.S. Emmerling M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20631-20635Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that plaque amyloid may represent a fraction of total Aβ in the brain that has been condensed and neutralized and no longer contributes to neurotoxicity. Therefore the neurochemical factors responsible for condensing Aβ into amyloid are important to identify, since they may represent an effective tissue protective response. Zn2+ is also significantly increased in the AD-affected neocortex and greatly enriched in both human (12.Suh S.W. Jensen K.B. Jensen M.S. Silva D.S. Kesslak J.P. Danscher G. Frederickson C.J. Brain Res. 2000; 852: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar) and transgenic mouse β-amyloid plaque cores (13.Lee J.-Y. Mook-Jung I. Koh J.-Y. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aβ possesses a high (≈100 nm) affinity binding site that is very highly specific for Zn2+ and a low (≈5 μm) affinity Zn2+ binding site of less selectivity that mediates protease resistance and precipitation of the peptide into amyloid (14.Bush A.I. Pettingell Jr., W.H Paradis M.D. Tanzi R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12152-12158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,15.Bush A.I. Pettingell W.H. Multhaup G. Paradis M.D. Vonsattel J.P. Gusella J.F. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Tanzi R.E. Science. 1994; 265: 1464-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). Zn2+-mediated assembly of Aβ is reversible with chelation (16.Huang X. Atwood C.S. Moir R.D. Hartshorn M.A. Vonsattel J.-P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26464-26470Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), which appears to be the mechanism by which chelators increase the extraction of Aβ from postmortem AD-affected brain samples (17.Cherny R.A. Legg J.T. McLean C.A. Fairlie D. Huang X. Atwood C.S. Beyreuther K. Tanzi R.E. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23223-23228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Zn2+ is a redox-inert antioxidant, and recently we reported that coincubation of Aβ with Zn2+inhibits Cu2+ reduction (6.Huang X. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Cuajungco M.P. Gray D.N. Lim J. Moir R.D. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7609-7616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar), therefore we hypothesized that Zn2+ may also inhibit H2O2production from Aβ. Here we report that Zn2+ inhibits Aβ1–42 neurotoxicity in cell culture, correlating with a suppression of H2O2 generated from the Cu2+interaction with the peptide, and a survey of AD-affected histological brain sections revealed that there is an inverse correlation between plaque deposits and 8-OH guanosine (8-OHG) levels in AD-affected brain tissue. These findings suggest that amyloid plaques in AD may form as a result of a more robust tissue zinc response, representing the effective quenching of abnormal Aβ-mediated redox activity. All chemicals used in this study were culture tested and of high grade and purity (purchased from Sigma, unless specified otherwise). Synthetic human Aβ1–42 peptide was obtained from Yale University, W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory (Batch numbers SP869BUS, SP902BUS, SP904BUS, SP919BUS, SP956BUS), dissolved in sterile distilled-deionized water, sonicated (3 min), and spun at 13,000 × g (15 min). The supernatant was used for cultures and in vitro assays. The protocol (number 96-4159) used in this study was approved under guidelines for animal research (Massachusetts General Hospital). Neuronal cultures were taken from frontal cortices of Harlan Sprague-Dawley rat embryonic (E18) pups. The cells were dissociated in Hanks' buffered saline solution (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 50 μm kynurenic acid, 10 mmpyruvate, and 100 mm HEPES, and plated (5 × 105 cells/well) in a 12-well polyethyleneimine-coated plate (Corning). Cortical cultures were grown at 95% O2, 5% CO2, 85% humidity for 5 days in serum-free Neurobasal medium with B-27 supplement (Life Technologies, Inc.), 20 μml-glutamate, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. On the 5th day (treatment day), the medium was replaced with serum-free Neurobasal plus l-glutamine without B-27 supplement, since B-27 contains various antioxidants that would mask the effects being investigated. Stock solutions were mixed in vehicle medium to final concentrations in the cell culture of 20 μm Aβ1–42, 20 μm ZnCl2, 20 μmCuCl2, 10 μm buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), or 1000 units/ml catalase. Experimental trials were done in triplicate wells. Viable cells stained with calcein-AM (Molecular Probes) were assessed using an automated cell counter or counted manually. In a separate series of experiments, human embryonic kidney 293 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The day before treatment, the cells were plated in triplicates in a 24-well uncoated plate (125,000 cells/well). The cells were treated with Aβ1–42 with or without ZnCl2 in serum-free DMEM withl-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. The CellTiter 96® nonradioactive cell proliferation assay (Promega) was used to assess cell viability 72 h following treatment. The wells were washed with phenol red-free, serum-free DMEM prior to addition of the sterile tetrazolium dye (15:100 dye ratio). Negative control was treated with 0.1% Triton X-100 before addition of the dye. Then, the plate was returned to the 37 °C incubator and left for 4 h. Following incubation, the solubilization/stop solution (500 μl) was added and was left for another hour to allow formazan crystals to solubilize. The final reaction product was read at 570 nm. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance followed by a post-hoc Student's t test. Significance level was set atp < 0.05. The cell-free H2O2 assay was performed on triplicate samples using a 96-well microtiter plate (SpectraMax Plus, Molecular Devices). Aβ1–42 peptide (10 μm), ZnCl2 (1 or 10 μm) or CuCl2 (1 or 10 μm), and a H2O2-scavenging agent tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride (TCEP; Pierce, 50 μm), were coincubated in Dulbecco's PBS buffer (300 μl), pH 7.4, for 1 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, the amount of H2O2 produced was deduced by measuring unreacted TCEP, according to our recently published protocol (6.Huang X. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Cuajungco M.P. Gray D.N. Lim J. Moir R.D. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7609-7616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). Cerebral cortex was obtained from 22 AD cases (ages 57–93 years, average 78.2) with postmortem intervals of 2–22 h (average 5.8) and prepared as described previously (18.Nunomura A. Perry G. Pappolla M.A. Wade R. Hirai K. Chiba S. Smith M.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Relative scale measurements of 8-OHG (immunocytochemistry using monoclonal antibody 1F7, which detects both DNA-associated 8-OH-2′-deoxyguanosine and RNA-associated 8-OH-2′-guanosine), and the area of Aβ deposition (immunocytochemistry using monoclonal antibody 4G8, which detects Aβ residues 17–24, Senetek), were performed using a Quantimet 570C Image Processing and Analysis system (Leica) as described previously (18.Nunomura A. Perry G. Pappolla M.A. Wade R. Hirai K. Chiba S. Smith M.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-Aβ antibody (4G8) recognizes senile plaques of various morphologies, as well as vessel-associated amyloid. The computer analysis followed the protocols of Hyman et al. (9.Hyman B.T. Marzloff K. Arriagada P.V. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 1993; 52: 594-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar) and involved identifying plaques by gray scale thresholding of immunoreactive deposits, and manually deleting the vessel-associated amyloid, as well as artifacts in the captured image, prior to measurement. There was no significant relationship between postmortem interval and 8-OHG levels in these samples. Since H2O2 mediates the enhancement of Aβ toxicity by Cu2+ (5.Huang X. Cuajungco M.P. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Tyndall J. Hanson G.R. Stokes K.C. Leopold M. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Saunders A.J. Lim J. Moir R.D. Glabe C. Bowden E.F. Masters C.L. Fairlie D.P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37111-37116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar), we examined the modulation of Aβ toxicity in primary rat brain cultures by Zn2+ and Cu2+ and contrasted this with the effects of coincubating Aβ with either a H2O2 scavenger (catalase, 1000 units/ml) or BSO (10 μm). By inhibiting γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, BSO inhibits the synthesis of glutathione, the major intracellular H2O2 scavenger (19.Campbell E.B. Hayward M.L. Griffith O.W. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 194: 268-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We found that 38% of cells treated with freshly prepared Aβ1–42 alone (20 μm) survived after 48 h incubation (Fig.1 A). Catalase protected neurons against Aβ1–42 neurotoxicity (60% survival) in agreement with previous findings (5.Huang X. Cuajungco M.P. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Tyndall J. Hanson G.R. Stokes K.C. Leopold M. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Saunders A.J. Lim J. Moir R.D. Glabe C. Bowden E.F. Masters C.L. Fairlie D.P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37111-37116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar), while BSO exacerbated the cytotoxicity of Aβ (7% survival, Fig. 1 A), consistent with a role for H2O2 in mediating Aβ toxicity. Paralleling the effect of catalase upon cell survival, the presence of Zn2+ (1:1 with Aβ, 20 μm) significantly protected against Aβ1–42 neurotoxicity (62% survival). In agreement with our previous findings (5.Huang X. Cuajungco M.P. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Tyndall J. Hanson G.R. Stokes K.C. Leopold M. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Saunders A.J. Lim J. Moir R.D. Glabe C. Bowden E.F. Masters C.L. Fairlie D.P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37111-37116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar), Cu2+ significantly exaggerated the cytotoxicity of Aβ1–42 (18% survival), which paralleled the effects of BSO. The effect of Zn2+ upon inhibiting Aβ1–42 toxicity was similar at a lower concentration (10 μm, Aβ:Zn2+ = 1:1, not shown). The presence of catalase, BSO, Cu2+, or Zn2+ alone had no significant effect on cell survival compared with untreated cells, suggesting that the effects of Cu2+ and Zn2+ in modulating Aβ toxicity were due to interaction with the peptide. We also observed that Cu2+ and Zn2+ had competitive effects upon Aβ1–42 toxicity in primary cortical cultures when coincubated at equimolar ratios (1:1:1) (Fig.1 B). To confirm that the rescue of Aβ toxicity by Zn2+ was due to interaction with the peptide and not due to Zn2+ binding to cellular elements in the mixed brain culture (e.g. inhibiting an excitotoxic response by binding to the NMDA receptor), we studied the effects of Zn2+ (1:1) upon Aβ toxicity in human embryonic kidney 293 cell culture. Similar to the rescue of Aβ toxicity in cortical primary cell culture (Fig.1 A), we found that Zn2+ also inhibited the toxicity of Aβ upon the kidney cells (Fig. 1 C). To explore whether the inhibition of Aβ toxicity by the presence of Zn2+ was due to the quenching of H2O2 production from Aβ, we studied the effect of Zn2+ on the generation of H2O2 by Aβ1–42 in a cell-free system. Aβ1–42 (10 μm) was coincubated with Cu2+(1 μm), since we have previously shown that H2O2 production by Aβ depends upon the presence of substoichiometric amounts of coper or iron (6.Huang X. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Cuajungco M.P. Gray D.N. Lim J. Moir R.D. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7609-7616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). In the presence of 1 μm copper, Aβ1–42 produced 4.9 μm H2O2. (Fig.2). Coincubation of this mixture with an equimolar concentration of ZnCl2 (1 μm) significantly decreased H2O2 production by ≈25%, while coincubation with 10-fold excess ZnCl2 (10 μm) markedly inhibited H2O2production by ≈90%. The presence of the metal ions alone promoted no significant H2O2 production in the absence of Aβ (Fig. 2). Since Zn2+ is concentrated in plaque cores to ≈1 mm (8.Lovell M.A. Robertson J.D. Teesdale W.J. Campbell J.L. Markesbery W.R. J. Neurol. Sci. 1998; 158: 47-52Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1812) Google Scholar, 12.Suh S.W. Jensen K.B. Jensen M.S. Silva D.S. Kesslak J.P. Danscher G. Frederickson C.J. Brain Res. 2000; 852: 274-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 13.Lee J.-Y. Mook-Jung I. Koh J.-Y. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we hypothesized that plaque may represent Aβ that does not form H2O2, and hence the abundance of plaque cores would not be expected to correlate with oxidation damage in AD. Therefore, we surveyed the relationship between tissue oxidation and amyloid density in AD postmortem tissue. To test the hypothesis that amyloid deposits represent the fraction of Aβ that has been successfully neutralized by Zn2+ in AD, we performed a correlative analysis between the quantity of histological amyloid and parenchymal oxidative damage in AD affected neocortical tissue. This revealed that there was a highly significant, log-linear inverse correlation between Aβ levels and oxidative damage to nucleic acid (8-OHG) (Fig.3), suggesting that the formation of amyloid plaque is associated with tissue protection in vivo. There was no obvious decrease in the 8-OHG intensity in neurons based on their apparent proximity to plaques, in agreement with our previous report (18.Nunomura A. Perry G. Pappolla M.A. Wade R. Hirai K. Chiba S. Smith M.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aβ induces neurotoxicity through cell-free H2O2 generation (5.Huang X. Cuajungco M.P. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Tyndall J. Hanson G.R. Stokes K.C. Leopold M. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Saunders A.J. Lim J. Moir R.D. Glabe C. Bowden E.F. Masters C.L. Fairlie D.P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37111-37116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar), and our current findings indicate that Zn2+ binding to Aβ inhibits neurotoxicity through suppressing cell-free H2O2 production. We also found that there is an inverse correlation between amyloid plaque density in AD and oxidation of neocortical tissue. Since plaque concentrations of Zn2+ are high enough to both precipitate Aβ (14.Bush A.I. Pettingell Jr., W.H Paradis M.D. Tanzi R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12152-12158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Bush A.I. Pettingell W.H. Multhaup G. Paradis M.D. Vonsattel J.P. Gusella J.F. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Tanzi R.E. Science. 1994; 265: 1464-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar) and suppress H2O2 in vitro, it is therefore likely that the Zn2+ within the amyloid plaques makes them redox-inert. This interpretation is consistent with the lack of oxidative modifications within the senile plaques such as nitrotyrosine and carbonyl adducts (18.Nunomura A. Perry G. Pappolla M.A. Wade R. Hirai K. Chiba S. Smith M.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20.Smith M.A. Richey Harris P.L. Sayre L.M. Beckman J.S. Perry G. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2653-2657Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that are found within neurons in the AD-affected neocortex. That we did not find a spatial relationship between 8-OHG and plaques may reflect the rapid migration of RNA (18.Nunomura A. Perry G. Pappolla M.A. Wade R. Hirai K. Chiba S. Smith M.A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1959-1964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) throughout the neuron, or alternatively, that the oxidizing stress comes from a ubiquitous origin such as elevated soluble Aβ whose levels correlate with tangle and neuritic pathology, and inversely with life-span, in AD (10.McLean C. Cherny R. Fraser F. Fuller S. Smith M. Beyreuther K. Bush A. Masters C. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 46: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest a protective role for Zn2+ in ameliorating Aβ-mediated oxidative damage in AD. Our findings are in agreement with a recent report that Zn2+ attenuates the toxicity of Aβ1–40 and may explain the observed rescue of cellular Na+/K+ ATPase activity (21.Lovell M.A. Xie C. Markesbery W.R. Brain Res. 1999; 823: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Since Na+/K+ ATPase is sensitively inhibited by H2O2 (22.Huang W. Wang Y. Askari A. Zolotarjova N. Gandjeizadeh M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1190: 108-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), its rescue by coincubating Zn2+ with Aβ may in fact be due to the inhibition of cell-free generation of H2O2. H2O2 production by Aβ is dependent upon the reduction of Cu2+ or Fe3+ by the peptide. We previously found that when incubated at equimolar concentrations with Cu2+ in the presence of Aβ1–42, Zn2+inhibits ≈50% of the production of Cu+ (6.Huang X. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Cuajungco M.P. Gray D.N. Lim J. Moir R.D. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7609-7616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). This may explain the 25% decrease in cell-free H2O2produced by Aβ1–42 in the presence of equimolar concentrations of Zn2+ and Cu2+ (1 μm) (Fig. 2), since a proposed mechanism for O22−formation by Aβ:Cu+ involves the donation of one electron from each of two Cu+ to O2 (5.Huang X. Cuajungco M.P. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Tyndall J. Hanson G.R. Stokes K.C. Leopold M. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Saunders A.J. Lim J. Moir R.D. Glabe C. Bowden E.F. Masters C.L.

Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Cuajungco M.P. Gray D.N. Lim J. Moir R.D. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7609-7616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). We recently found that when Aβ is coincubated with equal concentrations of Cu2+ and Zn2+ it binds equimolar amounts of both metal ions (≈1.5 equivalents of each at pH 7.4; Ref. 23.Atwood, C. S., Scarpa, R. C., Huang, X., Moir, R. D., Jones, W. D., Fairlie, D. P., Tanzi, R. E., and Bush, A. I. (2000) J. Neurochem., in pressGoogle Scholar). This suggests that there are separate selective Cu2+ and Zn2+ binding sites on Aβ and that when inhibiting H2O2 production, Zn2+ may displace nonspecific Cu2+ binding from a redox-active binding site on Aβ. Aβ1–42 possesses a much higher affinity for Cu2+ (high affinity K d = 10−17m, low affinity K d = 10−8; Ref. 23.Atwood, C. S., Scarpa, R. C., Huang, X., Moir, R. D., Jones, W. D., Fairlie, D. P., Tanzi, R. E., and Bush, A. I. (2000) J. Neurochem., in pressGoogle Scholar) compared with its highest affinity for Zn2+ (K d≈10−7; Ref. 14.Bush A.I. Pettingell Jr., W.H Paradis M.D. Tanzi R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12152-12158Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); therefore, in its soluble interstitial form, Aβ1–42 is likely to bind Cu2+ before it binds Zn2+. Zn2+ generally exerts its antioxidant effects by protecting free sulfhydryl groups from oxidation (there are none on Aβ) and by competing with prooxidant metal ions for binding sites and decreasing their ability to transfer electrons pathologically. We therefore propose that Aβ may form amyloid where the levels of interstitial Zn2+ are sufficiently elevated to compete with low affinity Cu2+ or Fe3+binding to Aβ and so quench the H2O2generated by soluble, neurotoxic forms of Aβ, at the expense of forming amyloid. Conversely, amyloid-poor brain tissue may be more prone to oxidation damage (Fig. 3) mediated by high levels of toxic, soluble Aβ (10.McLean C. Cherny R. Fraser F. Fuller S. Smith M. Beyreuther K. Bush A. Masters C. Ann. Neurol. 1999; 46: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1578) Google Scholar), because tissue Zn2+ concentrations are insufficiently elevated to form amyloid plaque. There is a large body of evidence indicating that zinc, copper, and iron are significantly elevated in the AD brain (reviewed in Ref. 3.Atwood C.S. Huang X. Moir R.D. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. Metal Ions Biol. Syst. 1999; 36: 309-364PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas abnormal Cu2+ elevation may drive the toxicity of Aβ (5.Huang X. Cuajungco M.P. Atwood C.S. Hartshorn M.A. Tyndall J. Hanson G.R. Stokes K.C. Leopold M. Multhaup G. Goldstein L.E. Scarpa R.C. Saunders A.J. Lim J. Moir R.D. Glabe C. Bowden E.F. Masters C.L. Fairlie D.P. Tanzi R.E. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37111-37116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar), interstitial Zn2+ elevation may reflect a homeostatic antioxidant response. Mechanistically, this could be due to Zn2+ release from the metallothionein (MT) pool upon glial activation (24.Penkowa M. Giralt M. Moos T. Thomsen P.S. Hernandez J. Hidalgo J. Exp. Neurol. 1999; 156: 149-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), or due to MT thiols being oxidized by H2O2 (25.Maret W. Vallee B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 3478-3482Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The hypothesis that Zn2+elevation forms amyloid is supported by the distribution of chelatable (loosely bound) Zn2+ in the brain, which is most highly concentrated in the corticofugal system (26.Frederickson C.J. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1989; 31: 145-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (967) Google Scholar) and therefore parallels the anatomical sites most prone to amyloid deposition. Other Aβ-associated proteins may also modulate the precipitation of Aβ in the presence of Zn2+, and so play a role in amyloid formation. The Zn2+ binding properties of α2-macroglobulin, a genetic risk factor for AD (27.Blacker D. Wilcox M.A. Laird N.M. Rodes L. Horvath S.M. Go R.C. Perry R. Watson Jr., B. Bassett S.S. McInnis M.G. Albert M.S. Hyman B.T. Tanzi R.E. Nat. Genet. 1998; 19: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar), modulate its binding to Aβ (28.Du Y. Ni B. Glinn M. Dodel R.C. Bales K.R. Zhang Z. Hyslop P.A. Paul S.M. J. Neurochem. 1997; 69: 299-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Also, we have recently reported that apolipoprotein E preserves Aβ solubility in the presence of Zn2+, and that the ApoE4 isoform, another risk factor for amyloid deposition and AD, is the poorest solubility chaperone under these conditions (29.Moir R.D. Atwood C.S. Romano D.M. Laurans M.H. Huang X. Bush A.I. Smith J.D. Tanzi R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 4595-4603Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Therefore, in ApoE4 carriers, Aβ is more likely to be precipitated by Zn2+ and, according to our current findings, disqualified from neurotoxic H2O2 production. However, ApoE is also an antioxidant that protects against H2O2-mediated damage, but ApoE4 is the poorest H2O2antioxidant of the isoforms (30.Miyata M. Smith J.D. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (801) Google Scholar, 31.Ramassamy C. Averill D. Beffert U. Bastianetto S. Theroux L. Lussier-Cacan S. Cohn J.S. Christen Y. Davignon J. Quirion R. Poirier J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 544-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), in concordance with the observation that AD patients with this allele have more oxidative injury to the neocortex than non-ApoE4 carriers (31.Ramassamy C. Averill D. Beffert U. Bastianetto S. Theroux L. Lussier-Cacan S. Cohn J.S. Christen Y. Davignon J. Quirion R. Poirier J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 544-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Therefore, whereas Zn2+-mediated Aβ precipitation may contribute to the increased amyloid plaque burden of ApoE4 carriers with AD, the quenching of Aβ-associated H2O2 production brought about by this response appears to be insufficient to compensate for the decreased antioxidant properties of ApoE4. We previously suspected that Zn2+ overload in the brain may be detrimental in the pathogenesis of AD, because Zn2+dramatically produced amyloid from soluble Aβ in vitro(15.Bush A.I. Pettingell W.H. Multhaup G. Paradis M.D. Vonsattel J.P. Gusella J.F. Beyreuther K. Masters C.L. Tanzi R.E. Science. 1994; 265: 1464-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar), and because a pilot clinical study had observed cases where zinc supplementation acutely worsened cognition in AD subjects. Our current findings force us to reconsider the position of Zn2+ in the pathophysiology of AD. No clear evidence has emerged that zinc supplementation is deleterious to the progression of AD, and upon further investigation, the detrimental effects of supplementation observed previously may have been due to gastrointestinal disturbance. 2A. I. Bush and C. L. Masters, personal communication. However, there also have not been any statistically satisfactory reports of the beneficial clinical effects of Zn2+ supplementation upon AD. We recently reported that zinc/copper-selective chelators markedly enhance the resolubilization of Aβ deposits from postmortem AD brain samples (17.Cherny R.A. Legg J.T. McLean C.A. Fairlie D. Huang X. Atwood C.S. Beyreuther K. Tanzi R.E. Masters C.L. Bush A.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23223-23228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), supporting the possibility that copper and zinc ions play a significant role in assembling amyloid. If a chelation approach were to be translated into an in vivo therapy for AD, our current findings indicate that it would be necessary to consider the risk of increasing brain oxidation damage if Zn2+ were removed from the amyloid mass before the removal of Cu2+ and Fe3+."

Nature. 1993; 364: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the association of Raf-1 with membranes appears to be essential for its activation. Forced membrane recruitment through attachment of the Ras prenylation moiety to the C terminus of Raf-1 has been shown to induce kinase activation by a mechanism reportedly independent of association with Ras (16Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 17Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). It was also found that overexpression of constitutively activated Ras proteins results in the recruitment of Raf-1 to membranes (16Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 17Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Although it was clear that Raf-1 associates with activated Ras in vivo, in vitroactivation of Raf-1 by Ras has been difficult to demonstrate (18Zhang X.F. Settleman J. Kyriakis J.M. Takeuchi-Suzuki E. Elledge S.J. Marshall M.S. Bruder J.T. Rapp U.R. Avruch J. Nature. 1993; 364: 308-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar, 19Traverse S. Cohen P. Paterson H. Marshall C. Rapp U. Grand R.J. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3175-3181PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it was proposed that Ras mediates recruitment of Raf-1 to membranes (20Hall A. Science. 1994; 264: 1413-1414Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The recruitment of Raf-1 to membranes has also been reported to be dependent on its association with phosphatidic acid (21Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Vasudevan C. Stolz D.B. Sung T.C. Frohman M.A. Watkins S.C. Romero G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1131-1139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 24Ghosh S. Strum J.C. Sciorra V.A. Daniel L. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8472-8480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Disruption of agonist-dependent PLD activity either pharmacologically or by expression of catalytically inactive mutants blocks recruitment of Raf-1 to membranes and Raf-1 activation. Furthermore, addition of exogenous PA reverses the effects of PLD inhibition on Raf-1 translocation and MAPK phosphorylation. Although PA does not activate Raf-1 in vitro or in vivo, addition of exogenous PA can induce recruitment of Raf-1 to membranes in HIRcB cells or Ras-transformed cells (21Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Vasudevan C. Stolz D.B. Sung T.C. Frohman M.A. Watkins S.C. Romero G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1131-1139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is clear that PA is required for agonist-dependent Raf-1 translocation. However, the relative contribution of Ras and PA to receptor-stimulated Raf-1 translocation is unknown. Here we provide definitive evidence that PA is essential for the recruitment of Raf-1 to cell membranes. We show that association between PA and Raf-1 is sufficient and necessary for targeting Raf-1 to the correct subcellular locus. Insulin stimulated the accumulation of Ras, Raf-1, phosphorylated MEK, phosphorylated MAPK, and PA in early endosomes. Mutation of a single residue in the PA-binding region of Raf-1 blocked translocation of Raf-1 to endosomes, whereas disruption of Ras-Raf interactions or Raf-1 kinase activity had no effect on translocation. Furthermore, expression of the PA binding-deficient Raf-1 mutant prevented insulin-dependent translocation of endogenous Raf-1 and MAPK activation. We also show that expression of the PA-binding region of Raf-1 can block MAPK activation by preventing Raf-1 translocation to endosomes. These results support a model in which agonist-dependent Raf-1 translocation is primarily mediated by PA, whereas Raf-1 activation is dependent on its interactions with Ras. According to this model, the translocation of Raf-1 to membranes and the activation of Raf-1 are distinct processes. Raf-1 recruitment is a function of PA, whereas the activation of Raf-1 is a consequence of the interaction between Raf-1 and activated Ras. Rat-1 fibroblasts that overexpress the human insulin receptor (HIRcB cells) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum as described previously (21Rizzo M.A. Shome K.

Transfections were performed using Superfect transfection reagent (QIAGEN Inc.) for imaging studies or LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) for biochemical assays. Transfection reagents were used according to the manufacturer's instructions. Transfection efficiencies reached ∼50% using Superfect and were ∼70–90% using LipofectAMINE. Expression of GFP-tagged constructs was within the same order of magnitude as expression of endogenous Raf-1 as determined by Western blotting of cell lysates. The primary antibodies used were as follows: mouse anti-Raf-1 and mouse anti-EEA-1 (Transduction Laboratories), mouse anti-Ras clone Ras10 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.), rabbit anti-insulin receptor (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-phosphorylated MEK and mouse anti-phosphorylated ERK1/2 clone E10 (New England Biolabs Inc.), and mouse anti-GFP (CLONTECH). Donkey secondary antibodies conjugated to fluorophores or horseradish peroxidase were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc. All reagents were obtained from Sigma unless noted otherwise. Endosomes were isolated from HIRcB cells essentially as described previously by Rizzo et al.(21Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Vasudevan C.

Eckardt G. Siddle K. Harrison L.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Cells were disrupted using a ball homogenizer as described previously (23Clark S. Eckardt G. Siddle K. Harrison L.C. Biochem. J. 1991; 276: 27-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Preparations were normalized to the protein content of the cell homogenates prior to sucrose gradient purification. Western blots of the immunoisolates were used to detect the presence of EEA-1, Raf-1, GFP, Ras, phosphorylated MEK, and phosphorylated MAPK as described below. This fraction was found to contain markers for the early endocytic pathway, including clathrin (21Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Vasudevan C. Stolz D.B. Sung T.C. Frohman M.A. Watkins S.C. Romero G. J. Biol.

To determine the level of contamination of these endosomal preparations with plasma membrane vesicles, the surface plasma membrane glycoproteins of insulin-treated cells were biotinylated to label exterior membranes. Cells were incubated with 2 mm biotin-LC-hydrazide (Pierce) in 100 mmsodium acetate for 30 min at 4 °C as described by Deal et al. (60Deal K.K. Lovinger D.M. Tamkun M.M. J. Neurosci. 1994; 14: 1666-1676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Vesicles isolated from these preparations using the fractionation procedure described above did not contain significant amounts of biotinylated cell-surface proteins as determined by probing of Western blots with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin and as resolved by chemiluminescence, thus demonstrating that these preparations were essentially free of contaminant plasma membranes vesicles that might have been derived from the homogenization procedure. HIRcB cells were prelabeled with 10 μCi/ml [3H]palmitate overnight prior to vesicle isolation. Lipids were extracted from isolated vesicles, and PA levels were quantitated as described previously (21Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Vasudevan C. Stolz D.B. Sung T.C. Frohman M.A. Watkins S.C. Romero G. J.

HIRcB cells were plated on poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslips and transfected with the indicated constructs as described (21Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Vasudevan C. Stolz D.B. Sung T.C.

Following stimulation, the coverslips were fixed in fresh 3% paraformaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min at 4 °C and permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100/PBS (2 min). After permeabilization, cells were washed extensively with PBS (4 × 5 min) and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS. Primary antibodies were applied in a 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS solution for 1 h, followed by washing with PBS (3 × 10 min) and staining with primary antibodies as indicated below. Coverslips were then washed with PBS (3 × 10 min) and stained with Cy5-labeled anti-mouse IgG or tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). Coverslips were washed prior to mounting on glass slides and analysis by confocal microscopy with a Leica TCS confocal system. Merged images were generated using Adobe Photoshop software. By convention, the first panel in each merged figure is coloredgreen, the second red, and the thirdblue. Colocalization of two colors is indicated by yellow, and three-color colocalization is indicated by white. To more clearly present areas of colocalization between multiple labels, points of colocalization were filtered out using the bitwise “and” function on Invovision ISEE software. Images generated using this function contain only colocalized pixels. The BODIPY®581/591 succinimidyl ester (Molecular Probes, Inc.) was conjugated to porcine pancreas insulin (Sigma) at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by addition of 25 mm ethanolamine. BODIPY-insulin was purified by Sephadex G-25 column chromatography. Cells were stimulated with 200 nm BODIPY-insulin for 5 min prior to fixation and immunostaining. Residue 398 of Raf-1 was mutated from arginine to alanine by the four-primer polymerase chain method and subcloned into the pEGFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH). Other Raf-1 mutants (R89L and K375M) were also subcloned into pEGFP-N1, whereas Ras constructs were subcloned into the pEGFP-C1 vector. The PA-binding region of Raf (residues 390–426) (24Ghosh S.

Single and double arginine-to-alanine mutations that correspond to Raf residues 398 and 401 were also introduced into this construct by site-directed mutagenesis. Successful generation of constructs was verified by sequencing and Western blotting. Mutant and wild-type Raf-GFP fusion proteins were cloned into the pFLAG-MAC vector using EcoRI and KpnI restriction sites. Recombinant protein was generated and affinity-purified on an anti-FLAG epitope M2 affinity column (Sigma) as described (25Shein C.H. Bio/Technology. 1989; 7: 1141-1149Google Scholar). The purity of recombinant protein was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Coomassie Blue staining; and Western blotting using antibodies against the FLAG epitope, Raf-1, and GFP. The purified protein was then tested for its ability to bind PA-coated plates (1 μg of dioleoyl-PA/9 μg of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (Avanti)/well) in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-type assay as described by Ghosh et al.(24Ghosh S.

Bound protein was detected using mouse anti-GFP antibodies (CLONTECH). Horseradish peroxidase activity was detected using AMPLEX Red reagent (Molecular Probes, Inc.). HIRcB cells were grown in 60-mm dishes and transfected with the indicated constructs using LipofectAMINE transfection reagent. Transfection efficiency was assessed by examination of the cells with a phase-contrast microscope and by determination of the GFP fluorescence. Efficiency of transfection varied between 70 and 90%. Cells were serum-starved for 18–24 h prior to insulin treatment. Cells were then scraped and lysed as described previously (21Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Vasudevan C. Stolz D.B. Sung T.C.

Cell lysates were boiled in SDS sample buffer, and equal amounts of protein were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, followed by transfer to a nitrocellulose membrane. The nitrocellulose membrane was then probed with a phospho-specific anti-MAPK antibody (New England Biolabs Inc.) and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (21Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Vasudevan C.

Immunocomplexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Mitogenic signaling cascades are initiated on the plasma membrane. However, activated receptors are found in endocytic structures shortly after activation, along with many signaling elements, including Raf-1 (26Di Guglielmo G.M. Baass P.C. Ou W.J. Posner B.I.

We have found that stimulation of HIRcB cells with insulin results in accumulation of Raf-1 in endocytic structures containing insulin receptors after transient association with plasma membranes (21Rizzo M.A. Shome K.

The association of Raf-1 with membranes has been linked to both Ras activation (16Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 17Stokoe D. Macdonald S.G. Cadwallader K. Symons M. Hancock J.F. Science. 1994; 264: 1463-1467Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar) and the generation of PA by PLD (21Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Vasudevan C. Stolz D.B. Sung T.C. Frohman M.A. Watkins S.C. Romero G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1131-1139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Therefore, we developed biochemical and imaging assays to examine the relative role of Ras and PA in recruiting Raf-1 to membranes. Insulin stimulated the accumulation of Ras, Raf-1, phosphorylated MEK, and phosphorylated MAPK in endocytic vesicles containing insulin receptors (Fig. 1 A). Consistent with our previous findings that Raf-1 recruitment to membranes requires PA, vesicles isolated after insulin treatment were substantially enriched in PA (Fig. 1 B). We have previously reported that brefeldin A (BFA) blocks signaling through insulin-dependent MAPK phosphorylation and insulin-dependent PA generation (21Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Vasudevan C. Stolz D.B. Sung T.C. Frohman M.A. Watkins S.C. Romero G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1131-1139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 22Shome K. Vasudevan C. Romero G. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 387-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Furthermore, we also showed that the effects of BFA on the MAPK cascade are reversed in the presence of PA, indicating that BFA inhibits insulin-dependent MAPK signaling through its effects on PLD activation (21Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Vasudevan C. Stolz D.B. Sung T.C. Frohman M.A. Watkins S.C. Romero G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1131-1139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Therefore, cells were pretreated with BFA to examine the role of PLD activation in the recruitment of signaling molecules to endosomes. As shown, vesicles isolated from BFA-treated cells contained significantly smaller quantities of the early endosome marker EEA-1 (59Mu F.T. Callaghan J.M. Steele-Mortimer O. Stenmark H. Parton R.G. Campbell P.L. McCluskey J. Yeo J.P. Tock E.P.C. Toh B.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13503-13511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar), Raf-1, phosphorylated MEK, and phosphorylated MAPK compared with vesicles isolated from cells that had not been treated with BFA. The inhibition of the accumulation of insulin receptors, Raf-1, and other signaling molecules in the endosomal compartment is consistent with previous reports showing that the internalization of the insulin receptor is sensitive to BFA treatment (21Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Vasudevan C. Stolz D.B. Sung T.C. Frohman M.A. Watkins S.C. Romero G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1131-1139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). These findings are consistent with a role for PA in endocytic trafficking and in recruitment of proteins to endosomes. However, our data do not exclude a role for ADP-ribosylation factor proteins in mediating these effects by mechanisms independent of PLD activation. The subcellular localization of the components of the MAPK cascade was further examined using confocal microscopy. In the absence of stimulation, Raf-GFP was diffusely localized in the cytosol. Insulin treatment resulted in the accumulation of Raf-GFP in vesicles that contained insulin receptors and EEA-1. To facilitate analysis of multiple labeling studies, points of colocalization between the multiple labels were filtered out using a bitwise “and” function. As shown in Fig. 2 A, all vesicles containing Raf-GFP also contained the insulin receptor and EEA-1, although many early endosomes contained no Raf-GFP. Furthermore, all Raf-GFP-containing vesicles were labeled with exogenously added BODIPY-conjugated insulin, indicating that the endosomes containing Raf-GFP were derived from the cell surface. Very little Raf-GFP was found on the plasma membrane after 5 min of insulin treatment. This is consistent with our previous studies on the localization of endogenous Raf-1 in HIRcB cells after insulin treatment (21Rizzo M.A. Shome K. Vasudevan C. Stolz D.B. Sung T.C. Frohman M.A. Watkins S.C. Romero G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1131-1139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Ras, phosphorylated MEK, and phosphorylated MAPK also accumulated in endosomes along with insulin receptors and Raf-GFP (Fig. 2, B and C). The accumulation of activated signaling elements in early endosomes suggests that these endosomes constitute important elements of the MAPK signaling cascade. To assess the relative contributions of Ras and PA to Raf-1 recruitment to membranes, we introduced point mutations in Raf-1 with the purpose of disrupting the interactions of Raf-1 with Ras or PA. The PA-binding region of Raf-1 contains three highly conserved cationic residues (24Ghosh S. Strum J.C. Sciorra V.A. Daniel L. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8472-8480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Mutation of one of these residues to alanine (R398A) was sufficient to disrupt the ability of recombinant Raf proteins to associate with PA using a microtiter plate binding assay as described by Ghosh et al.(24Ghosh S. Strum J.C. Sciorra V.A. Daniel L. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 8472-8480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3 A). It should be noted that this assay may not be ideal to assess the affinity of Raf-1 for PA in quantitative terms and that the interaction of Raf-1 with other lipids cannot be fully ruled out. This assay only allows the comparison of the relative affinities of different Raf-1 mutants for the adsorbed lipid mixture. As shown, mutation of Arg398 to Ala significantly decreased the binding affinity of Raf-1 for the adsorbed lipid. The PA-binding region is imbedded in the kinase domain of Raf-1. However, mutations in the PA-binding region do not alter the transforming activity of v-Raf (30Lu K.K. Bazarov A.V. Yoon L.S. Sedivy J.M. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 367-380PubMed Google Scholar), indicating that the kinase activity of Raf-1 is unaffected by these mutations. Furthermore, these mutations did not alter the ability of the construct to associate with endogenous Raf-1 and did not disrupt the basal activity of the kinase (data not shown), indicating that this mutation is unlikely to significantly disrupt protein folding. The interaction between Ras and Raf-1 was disrupted by a single mutation in the Ras-binding domain of Raf-1 (R89L). This mutant has been previously described (31Fabian J.R. Vojtek A.B. Cooper J.A. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 5982-5986Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Insulin treatment stimulated the translocation of Raf-GFP, Raf(R89L)-GFP, and catalytically inactive Raf(K375M)-GFP (32Dent P. Reardon D.B. Morrison D.K. Sturgill T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4125-4135Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) to vesicles containing insulin receptors as determined by confocal microscopy (Fig.3 B). However, Raf(R398A)-GFP remained diffuse after insulin treatment and did not significantly associate with vesicles or the plasma membrane. Insulin receptor internalization was unaffected. Disruption of Raf-PA interactions (R398A) also inhibited insulin-dependent recruitment of both the mutant construct and endogenous protein to isolated vesicles, whereas disruption of Ras-Raf interactions or Raf-1 kinase activity (K375M) did not affect Raf-1 translocation (Fig. 3 C). It is likely that expression of Raf(R398A)-GFP prevents translocation of endogenous Raf-1 via the formation of oligomeric complexes with the native protein (33Luo Z. Tzivion G. Belshaw P.J. Vavvas D. Marshall M. Avruch J. Nature. 1996; 383: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). In support of this, endogenous Raf-1 co-immunoprecipitated with Raf(R398A)-GFP (data not shown). These data indicate that Raf-1 translocation is independent of its association with Ras, but requires PA binding. The overexpression of each one of these mutations inhibited insulin-dependent MAPK phosphorylation (Fig. 3 D) to an extent that was consistent with transfection efficiency. This indicates that two different kinds of interactions, namely the association of Ras with Raf-1 and the binding of Raf-1 to PA-containing membranes, are required for the activation of the MAPK cascade. The role of Ras activation in Raf-1 recruitment was then assessed by expression of a dominant-negative Ras mutant (S17N) that is unable to bind GTP. Expression of this mutant has been shown to suppress Ras activation through sequestration of endogenous guanine nucleotide exchange factors (34Feig L.A. Cooper G.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 3235-3243Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 35Feig L.A. Nature Cell Biol. 1999; 1: E25-E27Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar). Transfection of this mutant in HIRcB cells did not alter agonist-dependent translocation of endogenous Raf-1 to vesicles (Fig. 4 A). However, Ras(S17N) significantly inhibited insulin-dependent MAPK phosphorylation to a degree that was consistent with the observed transfection efficiency. These results demonstrate that, although Raf-1 translocation to membranes does not require Ras activation, Ras signaling has a critical function in the activation of the MAPK cascade. To determine if the association with PA was sufficient to explain the translocation of Raf-1 to membranes, the PA-binding region (PABR) of Raf-1 was fused to GFP and expressed in HIRcB cells. The PABR is a highly conserved 36-amino acid region in the kinase domain of Raf-1 that has been shown to assoc"

To determine the physiological role of PPARα in cardiac fatty acid metabolism, we examined the regulation of expression of cardiac fatty acid-metabolizing proteins using PPARα-null mice. The capacity for constitutive myocardial β-oxidation of the medium and long chain fatty acids, octanoic acid and palmitic acid, was markedly reduced in the PPARα-null mice as compared with the wild-type mice, indicating that mitochondrial fatty acid catabolism is impaired in the absence of PPARα. In contrast, constitutive β-oxidation of the very long chain fatty acid, lignoceric acid, did not differ between the mice, suggesting that the constitutive expression of enzymes involved in peroxisomal β-oxidation is independent of PPARα.Indeed, PPARα-null mice had normal levels of the peroxisomal β-oxidation enzymes except the D-type bifunctional protein. At least seven mitochondrial fatty acid-metabolizing enzymes were expressed at much lower levels in the PPARα-null mice, whereas other fatty acid-metabolizing enzymes were present at similar or slightly lower levels in the PPARα-null, as compared with wild-type mice. Additionally, lower constitutive mRNA expression levels of fatty acid transporters were found in the PPARα-null mice, suggesting a role for PPARα in fatty acid transport and catabolism. Indeed, in fatty acid metabolism experiments in vivo, myocardial uptake of iodophenyl 9-methylpentadecanoic acid and its conversion to 3-methylnonanoic acid were reduced in the PPARα-null mice. Interestingly, a decreased ATP concentration after exposure to stress, abnormal cristae of the mitochondria, abnormal caveolae, and fibrosis were observed only in the myocardium of the PPARα-null mice. These cardiac abnormalities appeared to proceed in an age-dependent manner. Taken together, the results presented here indicate that PPARα controls constitutive fatty acid oxidation, thus establishing a role for the receptor in cardiac fatty acid homeostasis. Furthermore, altered expression of fatty acid-metabolizing proteins seems to lead to myocardial damage and fibrosis, as inflammation and abnormal cell growth control can cause these conditions.

The tissue distribution of each receptor is different, implying that each has unique functions (8.Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauca M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). In rodents, PPARα is abundant in the liver, kidney, and heart, all of which have high rates of fatty acid metabolism (8.Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauca M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). Little is known about the regulation of fatty acid metabolism in the heart, although such information may help to elucidate the regulatory systems and the physiological roles of PPARα in heart.Interest in the clinical use of iodine-123-labeled fatty acids is currently primarily focused on the use of iodine-123 15-(p-iodophenyl) pentadecanoic acid and modified fatty acid analogues such as 15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-R,S-methylpentadecanoic acid. which show delayed myocardial clearance, thus permitting single photon emission tomographic imaging (9.Chouraqui P.

Med. 1995; 22: 361-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Recently, 15-p-iodine-123 iodophenyl 9-methylpentadecanoic acid (9MPA), a new single photon agent, has been developed (9.Chouraqui P. Maddahi J. Henkin R. Karesh S.M. Galie E. Berman D.S. J. Nucl. Med. 1991; 32: 447-452PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Knapp F.F. Kropp Jr., J. Eur. J. Nucl. Med. 1995; 22: 361-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 11.Nakajima K. Taki J. Yamamoto W. Takata S. Shimizu M. Tonami N. Nucl. Med. Commun. 1998; 19: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). 9MPA is a modified long chain (15 carbons, C-15) fatty acid, which differs from iodophenyl pentadecanoic acid by a methyl branch at carbon 9. After venous injection, 9MPA is transferred to a myocardial triglyceride pool or undergoes β-oxidation three times in mitochondria, and a metabolite of 9-p-iodophenyl-3-methylnonanoic acid (3MNA) appears. Continuously, 3MNA undergoes α- and β-oxidation, to yield the metabolite of p-iodophenylacetic acid (PIPA). 9MPA is therefore well suited to studies into the abilities of fatty acid uptake and oxidation in vivo.In the present study, we analyzed cardiac fatty acid metabolism bothin vitro and vivo, using PPARα-null mice, finding a key role for PPARα in fatty acid metabolism and homeostasis. Additionally, we found that altered fatty acid metabolism, as well as inflammation and abnormal cell growth control, can cause cardiac tissue damage.DISCUSSIONThe energy substrate preference of the mammalian heart is tightly controlled during development and in response to diverse physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions (1.Bremer J.

McCune S.A. Kelly D.P. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2837-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). During the fetal period, glucose serves as the chief myocardial substrate (22.Neely J.R. Rovetto M.J. Oram J.F. Prog. Cardiovasc. Dis. 1972; 15: 289-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 24.Sack M.N. Rader T.A. Park S. McCune S.A. Kelly D.P. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2837-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Following birth, the mammalian heart switches to fatty acids as the chief energy substrate (25.Nieth H. Schollmeyer P. Nature. 1966; 209: 1244-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Compared with glucose, fatty acids when oxidized provide more ATP per mole of substrate, albeit at the expense of increased oxygen consumption. Thus, fatty acid oxidation provides a greater capacity for energy production to meet the physiologic demands imposed on the postnatal mammalian heart. In myocardium, energy production by the decomposition of the fatty acids is carried out through a complicated system involving the uptake of free fatty acids, intracellular transport, synthesis of acyl-CoAs, and β-oxidation. It is unclear whether the factors in this system are cooperatively controlled. PPARα, known to strongly control the fatty acid catabolism in liver (12.Aoyama T. Peters J.M. Iritani N. Nakajima T. Furihata K. Hashimoto T. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5678-5684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), is abundant in cardiomyocytes (8.Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauca M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). The role of PPARα in this tissue is unknown.In the present study, we have performed various biochemical and histological analyses on the hearts of the PPARα-null and wild-type mice, and reached the following conclusions. (i) The constitutive expression levels of at least seven mitochondrial fatty acid-metabolizing proteins (VLCAD, MCAD, SCAD, SCHAD, TPα, LACS, and CPT II) depend to a large extent on the presence of PPARα, which is similar to the case of cardiac carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (26.Brandt J.M. Djouadi F. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23786-23792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The constitutive expression levels of the two membrane fatty acid transporters (FAT and FATP) also depend on the presence of PPARα. On the other hand, the constitutive expression levels of peroxisomal fatty acid-metabolizing proteins are independent of the presence of PPARα, as is the case in liver (12.Aoyama T. Peters J.M. Iritani N. Nakajima T. Furihata K. Hashimoto T. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5678-5684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). (ii) The regulation of expression of two of the above mentioned mitochondrial proteins (VLCAD and LACS) has been observed in liver (12.Aoyama T. Peters J.M. Iritani N. Nakajima T. Furihata K. Hashimoto T. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5678-5684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), but the five other proteins (MCAD, SCAD, TPα, SCHAD, and CPT II) are regulated differently in liver (12.Aoyama T. Peters J.M. Iritani N. Nakajima T. Furihata K. Hashimoto T. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5678-5684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), indicating organ-specific regulation. (iii) Indeed, not all proteins relating to fatty acid catabolism are synchronistically controlled by PPARα, but many exhibits enhanced constitutive expression via PPARα. Therefore, the constitutive fatty acid catabolic ability, especially that toward long chain fatty acids, is strongly regulated by PPARα. Taking these new findings together, it becomes clear that one of the important physiological roles of PPARα in myocardium is the constitutive maintenance of energy production using fatty acids as substrates. It is interesting that the constitutive maintenance is independent of aging at least for 16–32 weeks after birth.In this study, we found histological abnormalities in heart, contraction band necrosis and myocardial fibrosis, only in the PPARα-null mice. These abnormalities were more serious in the older mice (32 weeks after birth; Fig. 5). Hypotension was also observed in the older PPARα-null mice. As shown in Table IV, both the starvation stress and the starvation plus high temperature stress significantly decreased the ATP concentration and increased the calcium concentration only in the PPARα-null mice. In hypoxia, it is known that a significant decrease in ATP reduces the function of Ca-ATPases that pump calcium outside cardiomyocytes, thereby increasing the myocardial calcium concentration (27.Nayler W.G. Poole-Wilson P.A. Williams A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1979; 11: 683-706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The phenomena observed only in the PPARα-null mice (Table IV) are similar to those in hypoxia, and the decrease of ATP caused by the stresses seems to be derived from the impaired fatty acid catabolic ability (Fig. 3). Indeed, cardiac and hepatic fatty acid oxidation enzymes in the PPARα-null mice were not induced by fasting (28.Leone T.C. Weinheimer C.J. Kelly D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7473-7478Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 29.Kersten S. Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin.

The increase of calcium concentration is known to activate calcium-dependent cytosolic phospholipase A2(30.Nalefski E.A. Sultzman L.A. Martin D.M. Kriz R.W. Towler P.S. Knopf J.L. Clark J.D. J. Biol.

The release of arachidonic acid causes cell damage through the synthesis of prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes (33.Lefer A.M. Fed.

Clin. 1987; 18: 85-99PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the PPARα-null mice exposed to stresses may have been at higher risk of cell damage. The damage may be more intense in the PPARα-null mice because of the lower ability to decompose arachidonic acid and leukotriene B4 (36.Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). Furthermore, since PPARα has an anti-inflammatory action by squelching an inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB, it is possible that a clearance of inflammation is delayed in the PPARα-null mice (37.Staels B.

Thus, our results suggest a relation between these cardiac abnormalities and the poor ability to produce energy from fatty acids. Interestingly, the lower energy production ability in patients with genetic deficiencies in mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation is known to cause cardiac diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myocardial fibrosis, and massive accumulation of triglycerides (3.Aoyama T.

Furthermore, massive caveolae were observed in the heart of the PPARα-null mice (Fig. 5 B). Caveolae seem to be important in regulating the cellular calcium concentration, since they have been shown to contain an inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-sensitive calcium channel and an ATP-dependent calcium pump (43.Fujimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The higher calcium concentration may increase the intensity of cardiac muscle contraction, which possibly causes another type of stress to myocardial cells, resulting in necrosis and fibrosis over a longer term.The cardiac muscle energy production system, utilizing fatty acids/triglycerides as a main fuel (25.Nieth H. Schollmeyer P. Nature. 1966; 209: 1244-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), has enormous potential to quickly respond to the rapid activity of animals; therefore, a very limited part of the system works under the constitutive condition. In the PPARα-null mice, the system may not be able to supply sufficient energy to myocardial cells for strife, excitement, starvation, and so on, leading to necrosis of the cells and successive fibrosis. These sudden occurrences naturally increase age-dependently, and the repair ability of damaged myocardial cells possibly decreases with aging.Recently, PPARα was demonstrated to correlate with the expression of the redox-regulated and oxidant stress-activated transcription factor NF-κB in the spleens of aged mice (44.Spencer N.F.L. Poynter M.E. Im S.Y. Daynes R.A. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 1581-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the levels of NF-κB and constitutive interleukins 6 and 12 in the spleens of aged PPARα-null mice were much higher than those of aged wild-type mice, and the level of lipid peroxidation in the livers of 48-week-old PPARα-null mice was much higher than that of the corresponding wild-type mice (45.Poynter M.E. Daynes R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32833-32841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a role for PPARα in the maintenance of redox balance during the aging process. The frequent fluctuation of redox balance may thereby promote age-dependent cardiac abnormality in the PPARα-null mice.In conclusion, our present studies suggest age-dependent cardiac damage is caused by defect in the PPARα mediated signaling pathways in the mouse heart, although the extensive analysis of the damage mechanism remains to be performed. It is of interest to confirm the role for PPARα in cardiac muscle in the near future. Long chain fatty acids are one of the major cardiac energy substrates, so understanding long chain fatty acid metabolism may help in elucidating the mechanisms of various heart diseases (1.Bremer J.

Changes in peroxisomal and microsomal gene expression induced by peroxisome proliferators are mediated by the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα),1 a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily (4.Isemann I.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). Three distinct PPARs have been found, PPARα, PPARβ (also called PPARδ), and PPARγ. The tissue distribution of each receptor is different, implying that each has unique functions (8.Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauca M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). In rodents, PPARα is abundant in the liver, kidney, and heart, all of which have high rates of fatty acid metabolism (8.Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauca M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). Little is known about the regulation of fatty acid metabolism in the heart, although such information may help to elucidate the regulatory systems and the physiological roles of PPARα in heart. Interest in the clinical use of iodine-123-labeled fatty acids is currently primarily focused on the use of iodine-123 15-(p-iodophenyl) pentadecanoic acid and modified fatty acid analogues such as 15-(p-iodophenyl)-3-R,S-methylpentadecanoic acid. which show delayed myocardial clearance, thus permitting single photon emission tomographic imaging (9.Chouraqui P. Maddahi J. Henkin R. Karesh S.M. Galie E. Berman D.S. J. Nucl. Med. 1991; 32: 447-452PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Knapp F.F. Kropp Jr., J. Eur. J. Nucl. Med. 1995; 22: 361-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Recently, 15-p-iodine-123 iodophenyl 9-methylpentadecanoic acid (9MPA), a new single photon agent, has been developed (9.Chouraqui P. Maddahi J. Henkin R. Karesh S.M. Galie E. Berman D.S. J. Nucl. Med. 1991; 32: 447-452PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Knapp F.F. Kropp Jr., J. Eur. J. Nucl. Med. 1995; 22: 361-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 11.Nakajima K. Taki J. Yamamoto W. Takata S. Shimizu M. Tonami N. Nucl. Med. Commun. 1998; 19: 839-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). 9MPA is a modified long chain (15 carbons, C-15) fatty acid, which differs from iodophenyl pentadecanoic acid by a methyl branch at carbon 9. After venous injection, 9MPA is transferred to a myocardial triglyceride pool or undergoes β-oxidation three times in mitochondria, and a metabolite of 9-p-iodophenyl-3-methylnonanoic acid (3MNA) appears. Continuously, 3MNA undergoes α- and β-oxidation, to yield the metabolite of p-iodophenylacetic acid (PIPA). 9MPA is therefore well suited to studies into the abilities of fatty acid uptake and oxidation in vivo. In the present study, we analyzed cardiac fatty acid metabolism bothin vitro and vivo, using PPARα-null mice, finding a key role for PPARα in fatty acid metabolism and homeostasis. Additionally, we found that altered fatty acid metabolism, as well as inflammation and abnormal cell growth control, can cause cardiac tissue damage. DISCUSSIONThe energy substrate preference of the mammalian heart is tightly controlled during development and in response to diverse physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions (1.Bremer J.

McCune S.A. Kelly D.P. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2837-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). During the fetal period, glucose serves as the chief myocardial substrate (22.Neely J.R. Rovetto M.J. Oram J.F. Prog. Cardiovasc. Dis. 1972; 15: 289-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (377) Google Scholar, 24.Sack M.N. Rader T.A. Park S. McCune S.A. Kelly D.P. Circulation. 1996; 94: 2837-2842Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Following birth, the mammalian heart switches to fatty acids as the chief energy substrate (25.Nieth H. Schollmeyer P. Nature. 1966; 209: 1244-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Compared with glucose, fatty acids when oxidized provide more ATP per mole of substrate, albeit at the expense of increased oxygen consumption. Thus, fatty acid oxidation provides a greater capacity for energy production to meet the physiologic demands imposed on the postnatal mammalian heart. In myocardium, energy production by the decomposition of the fatty acids is carried out through a complicated system involving the uptake of free fatty acids, intracellular transport, synthesis of acyl-CoAs, and β-oxidation. It is unclear whether the factors in this system are cooperatively controlled. PPARα, known to strongly control the fatty acid catabolism in liver (12.Aoyama T. Peters J.M. Iritani N. Nakajima T. Furihata K. Hashimoto T. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5678-5684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), is abundant in cardiomyocytes (8.Braissant O. Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauca M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). The role of PPARα in this tissue is unknown.In the present study, we have performed various biochemical and histological analyses on the hearts of the PPARα-null and wild-type mice, and reached the following conclusions. (i) The constitutive expression levels of at least seven mitochondrial fatty acid-metabolizing proteins (VLCAD, MCAD, SCAD, SCHAD, TPα, LACS, and CPT II) depend to a large extent on the presence of PPARα, which is similar to the case of cardiac carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (26.Brandt J.M. Djouadi F. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23786-23792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The constitutive expression levels of the two membrane fatty acid transporters (FAT and FATP) also depend on the presence of PPARα. On the other hand, the constitutive expression levels of peroxisomal fatty acid-metabolizing proteins are independent of the presence of PPARα, as is the case in liver (12.Aoyama T. Peters J.M. Iritani N. Nakajima T. Furihata K. Hashimoto T. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5678-5684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). (ii) The regulation of expression of two of the above mentioned mitochondrial proteins (VLCAD and LACS) has been observed in liver (12.Aoyama T. Peters J.M. Iritani N. Nakajima T. Furihata K. Hashimoto T. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5678-5684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), but the five other proteins (MCAD, SCAD, TPα, SCHAD, and CPT II) are regulated differently in liver (12.Aoyama T. Peters J.M. Iritani N. Nakajima T. Furihata K. Hashimoto T. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5678-5684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), indicating organ-specific regulation. (iii) Indeed, not all proteins relating to fatty acid catabolism are synchronistically controlled by PPARα, but many exhibits enhanced constitutive expression via PPARα. Therefore, the constitutive fatty acid catabolic ability, especially that toward long chain fatty acids, is strongly regulated by PPARα. Taking these new findings together, it becomes clear that one of the important physiological roles of PPARα in myocardium is the constitutive maintenance of energy production using fatty acids as substrates. It is interesting that the constitutive maintenance is independent of aging at least for 16–32 weeks after birth.In this study, we found histological abnormalities in heart, contraction band necrosis and myocardial fibrosis, only in the PPARα-null mice. These abnormalities were more serious in the older mice (32 weeks after birth; Fig. 5). Hypotension was also observed in the older PPARα-null mice. As shown in Table IV, both the starvation stress and the starvation plus high temperature stress significantly decreased the ATP concentration and increased the calcium concentration only in the PPARα-null mice. In hypoxia, it is known that a significant decrease in ATP reduces the function of Ca-ATPases that pump calcium outside cardiomyocytes, thereby increasing the myocardial calcium concentration (27.Nayler W.G. Poole-Wilson P.A. Williams A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1979; 11: 683-706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The phenomena observed only in the PPARα-null mice (Table IV) are similar to those in hypoxia, and the decrease of ATP caused by the stresses seems to be derived from the impaired fatty acid catabolic ability (Fig. 3). Indeed, cardiac and hepatic fatty acid oxidation enzymes in the PPARα-null mice were not induced by fasting (28.Leone T.C. Weinheimer C.J. Kelly D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7473-7478Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 29.Kersten S. Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar), which supports the decreased ATP concentration and the increased calcium concentration found in this study. The increase of calcium concentration is known to activate calcium-dependent cytosolic phospholipase A2(30.Nalefski E.A. Sultzman L.A. Martin D.M. Kriz R.W. Towler P.S. Knopf J.L. Clark J.D. J. Biol.

Foufelle F. Scotto C. Dauca M. Wahli W. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 354-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (1737) Google Scholar). The role of PPARα in this tissue is unknown. In the present study, we have performed various biochemical and histological analyses on the hearts of the PPARα-null and wild-type mice, and reached the following conclusions. (i) The constitutive expression levels of at least seven mitochondrial fatty acid-metabolizing proteins (VLCAD, MCAD, SCAD, SCHAD, TPα, LACS, and CPT II) depend to a large extent on the presence of PPARα, which is similar to the case of cardiac carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (26.Brandt J.M. Djouadi F. Kelly D.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23786-23792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). The constitutive expression levels of the two membrane fatty acid transporters (FAT and FATP) also depend on the presence of PPARα. On the other hand, the constitutive expression levels of peroxisomal fatty acid-metabolizing proteins are independent of the presence of PPARα, as is the case in liver (12.Aoyama T. Peters J.M. Iritani N. Nakajima T. Furihata K. Hashimoto T. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5678-5684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). (ii) The regulation of expression of two of the above mentioned mitochondrial proteins (VLCAD and LACS) has been observed in liver (12.Aoyama T. Peters J.M. Iritani N. Nakajima T. Furihata K. Hashimoto T. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5678-5684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), but the five other proteins (MCAD, SCAD, TPα, SCHAD, and CPT II) are regulated differently in liver (12.Aoyama T. Peters J.M. Iritani N. Nakajima T. Furihata K. Hashimoto T. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5678-5684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar), indicating organ-specific regulation. (iii) Indeed, not all proteins relating to fatty acid catabolism are synchronistically controlled by PPARα, but many exhibits enhanced constitutive expression via PPARα. Therefore, the constitutive fatty acid catabolic ability, especially that toward long chain fatty acids, is strongly regulated by PPARα. Taking these new findings together, it becomes clear that one of the important physiological roles of PPARα in myocardium is the constitutive maintenance of energy production using fatty acids as substrates. It is interesting that the constitutive maintenance is independent of aging at least for 16–32 weeks after birth. In this study, we found histological abnormalities in heart, contraction band necrosis and myocardial fibrosis, only in the PPARα-null mice. These abnormalities were more serious in the older mice (32 weeks after birth; Fig. 5). Hypotension was also observed in the older PPARα-null mice. As shown in Table IV, both the starvation stress and the starvation plus high temperature stress significantly decreased the ATP concentration and increased the calcium concentration only in the PPARα-null mice. In hypoxia, it is known that a significant decrease in ATP reduces the function of Ca-ATPases that pump calcium outside cardiomyocytes, thereby increasing the myocardial calcium concentration (27.Nayler W.G. Poole-Wilson P.A. Williams A. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1979; 11: 683-706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). The phenomena observed only in the PPARα-null mice (Table IV) are similar to those in hypoxia, and the decrease of ATP caused by the stresses seems to be derived from the impaired fatty acid catabolic ability (Fig. 3). Indeed, cardiac and hepatic fatty acid oxidation enzymes in the PPARα-null mice were not induced by fasting (28.Leone T.C. Weinheimer C.J. Kelly D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7473-7478Crossref PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar, 29.Kersten S. Seydoux J. Peters J.M. Gonzalez F.J. Desvergne B. Wahli W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1489-1498Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar), which supports the decreased ATP concentration and the increased calcium concentration found in this study. The increase of calcium concentration is known to activate calcium-dependent cytosolic phospholipase A2(30.Nalefski E.A. Sultzman L.A. Martin D.M. Kriz R.W. Towler P.S. Knopf J.L. Clark J.D. J. Biol.

A. 1994; 91: 11060-11064Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The release of arachidonic acid causes cell damage through the synthesis of prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes (33.Lefer A.M. Fed. Proc. 1985; 44: 275-280PubMed Google Scholar, 34.Lefer D.J. Mentley R.K. Lefer A.M. Arch. Int. Pharm. Ther. 1987; 287: 89-95PubMed Google Scholar, 35.Lefer A.M. Cardiovasc. Clin. 1987; 18: 85-99PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, the PPARα-null mice exposed to stresses may have been at higher risk of cell damage. The damage may be more intense in the PPARα-null mice because of the lower ability to decompose arachidonic acid and leukotriene B4 (36.Devchand P.R. Keller H. Peters J.M. Vazquez M. Gonzalez F.J. Wahli W. Nature. 1996; 384: 39-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (1201) Google Scholar). Furthermore, since PPARα has an anti-inflammatory action by squelching an inflammatory transcription factor NF-κB, it is possible that a clearance of inflammation is delayed in the PPARα-null mice (37.Staels B. Koenig W. Habib A. Merval R. Labret M. Torrra I.P. Delerive P. Fadel A. Chinetti G. Fruchart J.C. Najib J. Maclouf J. Tedgui A. Nature. 1998; 393: 790-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (1051) Google Scholar). Thus, our results suggest a relation between these cardiac abnormalities and the poor ability to produce energy from fatty acids. Interestingly, the lower energy production ability in patients with genetic deficiencies in mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation is known to cause cardiac diseases such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, myocardial fibrosis, and massive accumulation of triglycerides (3.Aoyama T.

Pediatr. 1998; 133: 247-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), which may support the occurrence of cardiac abnormalities in the present study. Furthermore, massive caveolae were observed in the heart of the PPARα-null mice (Fig. 5 B). Caveolae seem to be important in regulating the cellular calcium concentration, since they have been shown to contain an inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate-sensitive calcium channel and an ATP-dependent calcium pump (43.Fujimoto T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1147-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar). The higher calcium concentration may increase the intensity of cardiac muscle contraction, which possibly causes another type of stress to myocardial cells, resulting in necrosis and fibrosis over a longer term. The cardiac muscle energy production system, utilizing fatty acids/triglycerides as a main fuel (25.Nieth H. Schollmeyer P. Nature. 1966; 209: 1244-1245Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), has enormous potential to quickly respond to the rapid activity of animals; therefore, a very limited part of the system works under the constitutive condition. In the PPARα-null mice, the system may not be able to supply sufficient energy to myocardial cells for strife, excitement, starvation, and so on, leading to necrosis of the cells and successive fibrosis. These sudden occurrences naturally increase age-dependently, and the repair ability of damaged myocardial cells possibly decreases with aging. Recently, PPARα was demonstrated to correlate with the expression of the redox-regulated and oxidant stress-activated transcription factor NF-κB in the spleens of aged mice (44.Spencer N.F.L. Poynter M.E. Im S.Y. Daynes R.A. Int. Immunol. 1997; 9: 1581-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the levels of NF-κB and constitutive interleukins 6 and 12 in the spleens of aged PPARα-null mice were much higher than those of aged wild-type mice, and the level of lipid peroxidation in the livers of 48-week-old PPARα-null mice was much higher than that of the corresponding wild-type mice (45.Poynter M.E. Daynes R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32833-32841Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a role for PPARα in the maintenance of redox balance during the aging process. The frequent fluctuation of redox balance may thereby promote age-dependent cardiac abnormality in the PPARα-null mice. In conclusion, our present studies suggest age-dependent cardiac damage is caused by defect in the PPARα mediated signaling pathways in the mouse heart, although the extensive analysis of the damage mechanism remains to be performed. It is of interest to confirm the role for PPARα in cardiac muscle in the near future."

J. 1998; 11: 745-757PubMed Google Scholar). The potential for oxidative damage is greatly augmented however, if the antioxidant buffering capacity of the organ system is insufficiently expressed to contain pro-oxidant events. This is particularly critical in the lung at birth where the transition from placental to pulmonary respiration necessitates a rapid shift in oxygenation of the alveolar epithelial gas exchange surfaces from fetal (23 torr) to neonatal pO2 (70–100 torr). As the enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant capacities of the fetal lung are 3–6-fold lower compared with those of late neonates and adult (7 and references therein, 25), the potential for pro-oxidant events within the distal lung epithelium is substantially heightened at birth.The restitution of redox balance following oxidative stress depends upon the adaptive coordination of responses among redox-associated signaling pathways, genetic regulatory factors, and antioxidants (3.Müller J.M.

The tripeptide thioll-γ-glutamyl-l-cysteinyl-glycine, or GSH, is a ubiquitous cellular nonessential sulfhydryl amino acid, which plays an important role in maintaining intracellular redox balance and in augmenting cellular defenses in oxidative stress (5.Griffith O.W.

Among those which bear particular significance to oxygen-linked redox stresses are hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), each differentially potentiated by oxidative conditions (7.Haddad J.J.E. Land S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L492-L503PubMed Google Scholar, 15.Haddad J.J. Land S.C. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1999; 517: 91Google Scholar, 16.Huang L.E. Arney Z. Livingstone D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar). HIF-1α, first identified as a rate-limiting regulatory component in the hypoxic induction of erythropoietin, is selectively stabilized in hypoxia whereupon it is translocated to the nucleus and activates the expression of genes promoting vascular development, glycolytic metabolism, and also cell cycle events (16.Huang L.E.

Physiol. 1996; 271: C1172-C1180Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of HIF-1α is therefore consistent with the significant role that this factor plays in coordinating adaptive responses to hypoxia (16.Huang L.E. Arney Z. Livingstone D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1017) Google Scholar, 17.Jiang B.-H. Semenza G.L. Bauer C. Marti H.H. Am. J.

NF-κB (Rel) is a DNA binding factor that is maintained in the cytosol as a heterodimer in complex with its inhibitory subunit, IκB. Upon activation by inflammatory signals (such as cytokines) or pro-oxidant stresses, IκB dissociates allowing the Rel dimers of this factor to translocate to the nucleus and activate genes particularly involved in modulating the response of the cell to oxidative injury (19.Schreck R. Albermann K. Baeuerle P.A. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1992; 17: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar).We have previously shown that both HIF-1α and NF-κB are differentially active over ranges of oxygen tension, which recreate the elevation in pO2 within the perinatal lung that is coincident with the onset of ventilation (7.Haddad J.J.E. Land S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L492-L503PubMed Google Scholar). To determine how altered redox status within the alveolar epithelium may dictate genetic control between HIF-1α and NF-κB over relevant shifts inpO2, we evaluated the effect of the antioxidantsN-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) in modulating the genetic response of the alveolar epithelium to oxidative stress. Since the discovery of biologically occurring free radicals, NAC has been used as a probe in detecting the biochemical basis of oxidative-induced lung injury bothin vitro and in vivo experimental and clinical models (20.Bernard G.R. Am. J. Med. 1991; 91: 55S-59SAbstract Full Text PDF Scopus (206) Google Scholar). NAC has the capacity to negatively buffer electrophiles and is thus an antioxidant with cytoprotective potential. In addition to its direct antioxidant effects, NAC may also serve as a precursor for cysteine and glutathione biosynthesis, thereby positively buffering the cellular pool of nucleophilic species (21.Moldeus P. Cotgreave I.A. Berggren M. Respiration. 1986; 50: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). PDTC is a member of the dithiocarbamate family, known to exert both antioxidant and pro-oxidant effects in cells (22.Orrenius S. Nobel C.S. van den Dobbelsteen D.J. Burkitt M.J. Slater A.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 1032-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Reduced dithiocarbamate is readily oxidized by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species to generate dithiocarbamate thiol radicals and thiuram disulphides. As potent electrophiles, these readily induce the oxidation of GSH leading to the formation of GSSG, the oxidized form of glutathione (23.Nobel C.S., I. Kimland M. Lind B. Orrenius S. Slater A.F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26202-26208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Pretreatment with NAC or PDTC has been shown to suppress the activation of NF-κB and enhance that of activator protein 1 (3.Müller J.M. Rupec R.A. Baeuerle P.A. Methods: Comp. Methods. 1997; 11: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although PDTC-induced inhibition of NF-κB has often been attributed to its antioxidant, radical-scavenging properties, recent evidence suggests that this inhibitory effect could be mediated by direct oxidation of the thiol containing cysteinyl group critical to the activity of this transcription factor (24.Brennan P. O'Neill L.A. Biochem. J. 1996; 320: 975-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar).The present study was undertaken to investigate the role that these modulators of glutathione biosynthesis play to in determining the response of the perinatal alveolar epithelium at the gene level over fetal to neonatal oxygen shifts and to probe whether their effects are mediated by altering redox potential via the GSH/GSSG equilibrium.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAll experimental procedures involving the use of live animals were reviewed and approved under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986 (United Kingdom).ChemicalsUnless otherwise indicated, all chemicals of the highest analytical grade were purchased from Sigma.Primary Cell CulturesFetal alveolar type II (fATII) epithelial cells were isolated from lungs of fetuses taken from the uteri of pregnant rats at day 19–20 of gestation, essentially as described elsewhere (7.Haddad J.J.E. Land S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L492-L503PubMed Google Scholar). The change in oxygen equilibrium from fetal (∼3%) to postnatal environments constitutes a potential signaling mechanism within the perinatal lung (25.Cotton R.B. Foetal and Neonatal Physiology. 2nd Ed. Saunders, PA1998: 1165-1174Google Scholar). Consequently, shifts inpO2 relevant to the fetal lung in preterm and post-term neonatal periods were recreated using variable O2incubators. fATII cells, with or without NAC or PDTC pretreatments, were cultured for 24 h at fetal alveolarpO2 (23 torr, ≈3% O2, 5% CO2) followed by a control period at the samepO2 or re-equilibrated to early postnatal alveolar pO2 (76 torr, ≈10% O2, 5% CO2), mild hyperoxia (normoxia) (152 torr, ≈21% O2, 5% CO2), and severe hyperoxia (722 torr, ≈95% O2, 5% CO2) for 4 h at 37 °C. In each case, and under conditions of independent pretreatments, the adenylate energy charge remained ≥0.7, and transepithelial monolayer resistance was monitored as ≥250 Ω cm2.Cell Harvesting, Nuclear Protein Extraction, and Western AnalysisNuclear extracts were prepared from monolayer filters of fATII cells grown under hypoxia or hyperoxia, essentially as detailed elsewhere (7.Haddad J.J.E. Land S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L492-L503PubMed Google Scholar, 26.Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1694) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. Nuclear proteins (20–25 μg) were resolved by 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, transferred into Tris-buffered saline, and the nonspecific binding sites were blocked for 1 h at room temperature. Monoclonal IgG anti-HIF-1α (Novus Biologicals Co.) and polyclonal IgG p65 anti-NF-κB (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) antibodies were used for primary detection. Anti-rabbit Ig-biotinylated antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was employed for secondary detection followed by the addition of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate. The membrane was enhanced (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to an automatic x-ray film processor. β-Actin standard was used as a reference for semiquantitative loading in parallel lanes for each variable. Blots were digitized using a transilluminating scanner, and the density of bands relative to β-actin were determined using UN-Scan-IT 32-bit automated digitizing system (version 5.1, Silk Scientific Corp., Orem, UT). Data from at least four independent blots were pooled, averaged, and plotted as a percentage of maximal abundance/activation relative to control at staticpO2.Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay and DNA Binding ActivityCustom deoxyoligonucleotide probe sequences were purchased from Genosys: HIF-1α, 5′-GCCCTACGTGCTGTCTCA-3′; and NF-κB, 5′-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCCAGGC-3′ (binding sequences are underlined). Gel-purified double-stranded DNA was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products). Identical amounts of radioactive probe (1–2 × 104 counts·min−1) were added to binding reactions containing 1–5 μg of fATII nuclear extracts in a final volume of 40 μl in DNA binding buffer (7.Haddad J.J.E. Land S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L492-L503PubMed Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures were incubated for 30 min at 25 °C before separating on nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gels at room temperature and subjected to electrophoresis with 1:10 5× Tris-Borate-EDTA buffer. A nonspecific competitive polydeoxyinosinic-deoxycytidylic acid (poly(dI-dC)) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was added to reaction mixtures after the addition of labeled probe. Gels were transferred to ion-exchange chromatography paper, vacuum dried, and quantitated by phosphorimaging using a Canberra-Packard Instant Imager.NAC and PDTC PretreatmentsStock solutions of NAC (1125 mm) and PDTC (1125 μm) were prepared in deionized water and stored at 4 °C for up to 2 weeks. fATII cells grown to confluence were pretreated for 24 h at 37 °C with NAC (0 (control), 1, 10, and 50 mm) or PDTC (0, 10, 50 and 100 μm) before exposure to various fetal to neonatal oxygen tensions for 4 h. After each treatment, fATII cells were washed with pre-equilibrated Hanks' balanced salt solution and centrifuged, and nuclear extracts were prepared, as described above.Glutathione Determination and Assessment of Redox EquilibriumReduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) glutathione concentrations were determined enzymatically with methylglyoxal by the method originally reported by Bergmeyer (27.Bergmeyer H.-U. Methods of Enzymatic Analysis. 2nd Ed. Verlag Chemie, Berlin1965Google Scholar), with significant modifications (7.Haddad J.J.E. Land S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L492-L503PubMed Google Scholar). fATII epithelial cells grown on monolayers, with or without NAC or PDTC pretreatments, were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and immediately 500 μl of 7% perchloric acid was added to the medium and cells were scraped. The slurry was then centrifuged to precipitate the protein formed and the supernatant snap frozen on liquid nitrogen. Samples were neutralized with a known volume of 3 m KHCO3, and GSH/methylglyoxal-linked changes in absorbance at 240 (GSH) and 340 nm (GSSG) were recorded spectrophotometrically (7.Haddad J.J.E. Land S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L492-L503PubMed Google Scholar). Protein content was reconstituted in 1 m NaOH and determined by Bradford (28.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213377) Google Scholar). Results are expressed as μmol·mg−1 protein.In Vitro Treatment of Nuclear Extracts with Exogenous GlutathioneIn vitro experiments with glutathione were performed by incubating 5 μg of nuclear extracts of fATII cells exposed to various ΔpO2 regimen with different concentrations of GSH and GSSG for 15 min on ice. The total glutathione (GSH + GSSG) concentration/reaction mixture (40 μl) was adjusted to 100 nmol/ml, and the ratio ([GSH] + [GSSG])/([GSSG]) was modulated such that [GSSG] was increased at the expense of [GSH]. Ratios were adjusted to final values of 100, 50, 10, 5, 2, 1.25, and 1. After incubation period samples were assayed for the binding activities of HIF-1α and NF-κB as indicated above. All nuclear extracts tested prior to the addition of glutathione had undetectable levels of GSH or GSSG (≪0.01 nmol/ml).Assessment of the Adenylate Charge Ratio, Trypan Blue Exclusion, and Tetrazolium Reduction as Independent Indices of Cell Viability Following Pretreatment with Either NAC or PDTCEvaluation of the adenylate high energy phosphate content as an index of cell viability and metabolic activity was based on the energy charge ratio determination for various treatments according to Atkinson (29.Atkinson D.E. Cellular Energy Metabolism and Its Regulation. 2nd Ed. Academic Press, New York1977Google Scholar). Trypan blue (0.4%) exclusion indicates the relative percentage of cells that are viable with respect to various treatments, such that the viability was greater than 90% with either NAC or PDTC pretreatments. Tetrazolium salt 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide cleavage into formazan blue by the mitochondrial enzyme succinate dehydrogenase is considered a reliable assessment of the degree of cell survival (30.Denizot F. Lang R. J. Immunol. Methods. 1986; 89: 271-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (4256) Google Scholar).Data Handling and Statistical AnalysisExperimental results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by one way analysis of variance (ANOVA), followed by post hoc Tukey's test to determine mean separation significance among treatments. The a priori acceptable level of significance at 95% confidence was considered p < 0.05.DISCUSSIONThe activation of the transcription factors HIF-1α and NF-κB in the distal epithelial lining of the developing lung is redox- and oxygen-sensitive (this study and Ref. 7.Haddad J.J.E. Land S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L492-L503PubMed Google Scholar). To further clarify the molecular mechanisms involved in modulating the genetic response of the fetal lung to oxidative stress, we have focused our attention on the link between cellular antioxidant/pro-oxidant equilibrium and the nuclear translocation and DNA consensus sequence binding (activation) of HIF-1α and NF-κB. To potentiate changes in cellular redox balance through the glutathione biosynthetic pathway, cultures were exposed to an experimental shift in pO2 with or without NAC, a thiol-containing antioxidant and substrate for GSH synthesis (31.Kelly G.S. Altern. Med. Rev. 1998; 3: 114-127PubMed Google Scholar), or PDTC, possessing both antioxidant thiocarbamate and thiuram pro-oxidant characteristics (22.Orrenius S. Nobel C.S. van den Dobbelsteen D.J. Burkitt M.J. Slater A.F. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 1032-1038Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).NAC induced a significant, dose-dependent increase in HIF-1α nuclear abundance, which was greater under a 23→152 and 23→722 torr ΔpO2 regimen than observed under stimulating conditions without NAC (23 and 23→76 torr). DNA consensus sequence binding was also preserved at elevatedpO2 at maximal concentrations of NAC employed in this study. These observations suggest that NAC pretreatment effectively manipulate the hypoxia-/redox-dependent signaling sequence, which governs both nuclear abundance and activity of HIF-1α independently from the imposed pO2regimen. This is in keeping with the capacity for NAC to suppress and/or scavenge reactive oxygen intermediates (21.Moldeus P. Cotgreave I.A. Berggren M. Respiration. 1986; 50: 31-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar, 31.Kelly G.S. Altern. Med. Rev. 1998; 3: 114-127PubMed Google Scholar), thereby imposing a reducing cellular environment, protracting the half-life of cytosolic HIF-1α, and favoring its translocation to the nucleus. As NAC is an acetylated variant of the amino acid L-cysteine, it possesses both direct (i.e. oxidizable sulfhydryl groups) and indirect (i.e. as a substrate for the biosynthesis of GSH) antioxidant activity (20.Bernard G.R. Am. J. Med. 1991; 91: 55S-59SAbstract Full Text PDF Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 31.Kelly G.S. Altern. Med. Rev. 1998; 3: 114-127PubMed Google Scholar). To further elucidate the pathways leading to activation of HIF-1α, glutathione concentrations were enzymatically assessed in vitro in cultures exposed to 24 h of NAC pretreatment. In this, and a previous study (7.Haddad J.J.E. Land S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L492-L503PubMed Google Scholar), we noted that shifting fATII beyond fetal lung oxygen tensions resulted in an elevated total glutathione pool characterized by a 4-fold rise in [GSH], a modest reduction in [GSSG], and a parallel fall in HIF-1α activity. Although we cannot exclude direct antioxidant buffering by NAC, the observable effect of this compound was to potentiate further both the elevation of [GSH] and reduction of [GSSG] (Fig. 6 and Table I) beyond the shift that occurs naturally with elevated pO2 regimen. We have previously shown (7.Haddad J.J.E. Land S.C. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L492-L503PubMed Google Scholar) that pretreatment of hypoxic cultures withl-buthionine-(S,R)-sulfoximine, an irreversible specific inhibitor of the rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of glutathione, γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (γ-GCS) (32.Griffith O.W. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7558-7560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), led to a dose-dependent inactivation of HIF-1α, suggesting GSH may be a key modulator of the activity of this factor. In keeping with this, we note that by experimentally increasing GSSG concentrations 4–5-fold in fATII cells using 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea or carmustine, an inhibitor of glutathione reductase (GSSG-RD), a partial abrogation of the hypoxia-induced activation of HIF-1α can be achieved, ostensibly by invoking an oxidizing environment. 2J. J. E. Haddad, R. E. Olver, and S. C. Land, unpublished observations. It seems clear, therefore, that the oxygen and ROS responsiveness of HIF-1α resides over a permissive range of antioxidant buffering capacities with the implication that such compounds determine the physiological activity (i.e. the in vivo K m) of oxygen-responsive transcription factors to a hypoxia or hyperoxia-linked signal. Fig. 9 presents a schematic summary of the glutathione-linked signaling pathways responsible for the regulation of HIF-1α in fetal distal lung epithelium.Much recent evidence highlights NF-κB as playing a critical role in coordinating early gene responses to the production of ROS (19.Schreck R. Albermann K. Baeuerle P.A. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1992; 17: 221-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar), therefore the NAC-induced shift in the glutathione redox state toward a reducing equilibrium would be expected to suppress the activity of this transcription factor. Pretreatment with NAC predictably diminished the hyperoxic nuclear translocation and DNA consensus binding of NF-κB p65 (the major transactivating member of the NF-κB family) in a dose-dependent manner. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that NF-κB activation by a wide variety of stimuli can be blocked by NAC, suggesting that the production of reactive oxygen metabolites is a requisite component of the activation sequence for this transcription factor (33.Schreck R. Rieber P. Baeuerle P.A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 2247-2258Crossref PubMed Scopus (3395) Google Scholar). As ROS generation is rapid, the capacity for NAC to suppress the activation of NF-κB may center largely upon the acute inherent antioxidant characteristics of this compound, although the cellular activity of this transcription factor is favored by a lowered GSH/GSSG incorporating elevated GSSG.Dithiocarbamates, including PDTC, induce differential effects on redox equilibrium according to: (i) their ability to decrease single electron radical species (a reduction property) and (ii) their capacity to oxidize GSH and related thiol compounds, thereby modulating glutathione recycling potential (an oxidation property; 22, 34). As with other dithiocarbamates, PDTC thus possesses the capacity to exert both anti- and pro-oxidant effects, the former being mediated through dithiocarboxy scavenging of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), superoxide anion (O⨪2) (35.Mankhetkorn S. Abedinzadeh Z. Houee-Levin C. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1994; 17: 517-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and hydroxyl radical (·OH) (36.Liu J. Shigenaga M.K. Yan L.J. Mori A. Ames B.N. Free Radic. Res. 1996; 24: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), and the latter being mediated by its oxidation by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, generating dithiocarbamate thiyl radicals and thiuram disulphides, which directly oxidize GSH to GSSG, a potent regulator of several transcription factors and signal transducing pathways in lung and other systems (36.Liu J. Shigenaga M.K. Yan L.J. Mori A. Ames B.N. Free Radic. Res. 1996; 24: 461-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar).In this report we have shown regulated differential effects of PDTC on the activation of HIF-1α and NF-κB, revealing a striking equilibrium between the antioxidant and pro-oxidant modes of action of dithiocarbamates. PDTC, like NAC, induced HIF-1α nuclear translocation at all ΔpO2 regimen investigated; however, it failed to induce HI"

However, little is known about how the DnaK system handles proteins that have already aggregated. In this study, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as a model system to generate stable populations of protein aggregates comprising controlled ranges of particle sizes. The DnaK system recognized the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase aggregates as authentic substrates and specifically solubilized and refolded the protein into a native enzyme. The efficiency of disaggregation by the DnaK system was high with small aggregates, but the efficiency decreased as the size of the aggregates increased. High folding efficiency was restored by either excess DnaK or substoichiometric amounts of the chaperone ClpB. We suggest a mechanism whereby the DnaK system can readily solubilize small aggregates and refold them into active proteins. With large aggregates, however, the binding sites for the DnaK system had to be dynamically exposed with excess DnaK or the catalytic action of ClpB and ATP. Disaggregation by the DnaK machinery in the cell can solubilize early aggregates that formed accidentally during chaperone-assisted protein folding or that escaped the protection of “holding” chaperones during stress.

Hartl F.U. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 68-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar and 2.Bukau B. Schmid F.X. Buchner J. Bukau B. Molecular Chaperones and Folding Catalysts. Regulation, Cellular Function and Mechanism. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1999: 3-10Google Scholar). Chaperones can specifically recognize and interact with non-native proteins, mostly through hydrophobic interactions with exposed hydrophobic surfaces. Some chaperones such as HtpG, DnaK, DnaJ, GroEL, and IbpB fromEscherichia coli are also termed “holders” because they can form a binary complex with unstable protein folding intermediates and thus prevent aggregation (for a review see Ref. 3.Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar). However, under physiological conditions chaperones such as GroEL in the presence of GroES and ATP or DnaK in the presence of DnaJ, GrpE, and ATP can also act as “folders,” which interact in a more dynamic manner with protein folding intermediates and thus maintain proteins within folding pathways that lead to the native structure. Much remains to be understood about the molecular mechanism through which different chaperone systems assist protein folding. Cycles of binding and release that are fueled by ATP and hydrolysis may be a common theme in the mode of action of chaperones that are as structurally and functionally different as DnaK, GroEL, and HtpG (2.Bukau B. Schmid F.X. Buchner J. Bukau B. Molecular Chaperones and Folding Catalysts. Regulation, Cellular Function and Mechanism. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1999: 3-10Google Scholar). Problems arise during stress when unfolded proteins become highly unstable and escape the protective action of the “holding” reservoir of the chaperone network. Soluble unfolded proteins do not remain in solution waiting for assisted refolding by “folding” chaperones after stress. Rather, unfolded proteins tend to assume an alternatively stable conformation in the form of insoluble aggregates enriched with β-pleated structures and exposed hydrophobic surfaces that remain inactive after stress (4.Fink A.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 425-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 5.Jaenicke R. Seckler R. Bukau B. Molecular Chaperones and Folding Catalysts. Regulation, Cellular Function and Mechanism. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1999: 407-436Google Scholar). In vitro, most chaperone systems are inefficient in actively dissolving protein aggregates. For the DnaK system, only one report mentions that a molar excess of the DnaK system can efficiently reactivate previously heat-aggregated RNA polymerase (6.Skowyra D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Cell. 1990; 62: 939-944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 7.Ziemienowicz A. Skowyra D. Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25425-25431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Negligible amounts of pre-aggregated enzymes such as luciferase are recovered in the presence of a large (100–1000-fold) molar excess of the DnaK or Hsp70 chaperone systems (8.Schröder H. Langer T. Hartl F.-U. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 9.Glover J.R. Lindquist S.

In contrast, substoichiometric levels of the DnaK system in the presence of the chaperone ClpB suffice to efficiently solubilize and reactivate a wide array of previously aggregated E. coli and model protein substrates (12.Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Peres Ben-Zvi A. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 23: 13732-13737Crossref Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 13.Mogk A. Tomoyasu T. Goloubinoff P. Rüdiger S. Röder D. Langen H. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6934-6949Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). ClpB was shown to modify and precondition the nature of large turbid aggregates toward subsequent solubilization and refolding by the DnaK system (12.Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Peres Ben-Zvi A. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 23: 13732-13737Crossref Scopus (497) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanism by which the DnaK system alone mediates efficient solubilization of protein aggregates and the spectrum of action of the DnaK system with regard to the nature and size of the aggregated substrates remain unclear. In this study, we address the mechanism by which the DnaK chaperone system achieves solubilization and refolding of protein aggregates that have different degrees of complexity. Using stable forms of aggregates of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH)1 as model substrates, we have demonstrated that the DnaK system alone can directly interact, disaggregate, and reactivate stably aggregated protein particles. The efficiency of disaggregation decreased as the size of the aggregate increased, but efficient disaggregation was restored by a large molar excess of DnaK or catalytic amounts of ClpB. Protein purifications were performed according to published procedures: DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE (14.Laufen T. Mayer M.P. Beisel C. Klostermeier D. Reinstein J. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Rabbit muscle pyruvate kinase and lyophilized G6PDH from Leuconostoc mesenteroides were purchased from Sigma. G6PDH was resuspended in 20% glycerol to a final concentration of 300 μm and used as a stock solution. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad Bradford assay with bovine serum albumin as a standard. Protein concentrations are always expressed in protomers. Various concentrations of native G6PDH were denatured in three steps: (i) unfolding (5 min at 47 °C in 5m urea, 20 mm dithiothreitol, and 8% glycerol); (ii) dilution (50-fold dilution in folding buffer (50 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.5, 20 mmMgAc2, 150 mm KCl, 10 mmdithiothreitol, and 3 mm phosphoenolpyruvate) at 47 °C); (iii) stabilization (15 min at 47 °C). Large turbid G6PDH aggregates were formed by a 20 min incubation in folding buffer at 65 °C. The oligomeric state and apparent size of the various forms of denatured G6PDH were estimated by size-exclusion chromatography in buffer (50 mmtriethanolamine, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgAc2 and 150 mm KCl), using a Superose 6HR10/30 gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The absorbance was monitored at 280 nm. Apparent molecular weights were estimated by gel filtration standards (Bio-Rad). Spectroscopic measurements were performed in a Perkin-Elmer luminescence spectrometer LS50B. The various forms and concentrations of aggregated G6PDH were incubated in folding buffer with 50 μm 4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid (bis-ANS, Molecular Probes) for 5 min. bis-ANS fluorescence of G6PDH was measured with excitation at 397 nm and emission at 496 nm. Turbidity was measured in a four-sided quartz cuvette at an excitation and emission wavelength of 550 nm. Assays were performed in folding buffer in the presence of an ATP-regenerating system (3 mmphosphoenolpyruvate and 20 μg/ml pyruvate kinase), which was active for the concentration chaperones tested over at least 5 h at 30 °C. Unless otherwise specified, concentrations and relative chaperone ratios in the DnaK system remained constant (3.5 μm DnaK, 0.7 μm DnaJ, 0.35 μmGrpE). Refolding of G6PDH was initiated at 30 °C by the addition of 3 mm ATP and pyruvate kinase. Maximal rates of G6PDH refolding were derived from the linear phase of the time curves of recovered enzymatic activity (18.Diamant S. Goloubinoff P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9688-9694Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Similar rates and yields of the DnaK-mediated reactivation of aggregated G6PDH were obtained when the DnaK chaperone system, ATP, and pyruvate kinase were added immediately or after a delay of up to 30 min following heat stabilization (data not shown). This demonstrates the high stability of the G6PDH aggregates. In general, chaperones and ATP were added within 4 min after the final heat stabilization step of the G6PDH aggregates. The G6PDH activity was measured using the spectroscopic method as described in Ref. 18.Diamant S. Goloubinoff P. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 9688-9694Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar. The ATPase activity was measured by a colorimetric method for phosphate determination using the phosphorus diagnostic reagent from Sigma (19.Mendoza J.A. Warren T. Dulin P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 229: 271-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). To analyze the mechanism by which the DnaK chaperone system specifically solubilizes and refolds populations of stable protein aggregates of varying sizes, we first identified and characterized appropriate substrates for the reaction. When native G6PDH was pretreated with dithiothreitol and 5m urea at 47 °C for 5 min and then diluted to final concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 2.8 μm in folding buffer, significant levels of spontaneous reactivation occurred at 30 °C. However, spontaneous reactivation was abolished following an additional incubation of 15 min at 47 °C. Only this complex procedure (urea and heat denaturation, dilution, and a final heat stabilization step) was able to reproducibly generate populations of non-turbid yet stable and inactive aggregates with defined size distributions (see below). Incubation for 20 min at 65 °C also yielded stable inactive aggregates that were turbid with undefined high degrees of complexity. Gel filtration chromatography of the G6PDH forms that were both denatured and heat-stabilized at four different concentrations (0.3–1.5 μm, Fig.1 a) showed that the majority of species was resolved in a continuum of soluble small oligomeric particles ranging from 106 kDa (Fig. 1 a, peak III) to 5,000 kDa (peak II). Only a minor fraction eluted in the void volume (5–40 × 103 kDa, according to the specifications of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (Fig.1 a, peak I). As the final concentration at which the protein was heat-stabilized was increased, the majority of the protein species in peak II was shifted toward a heavier molecular weight (Fig. 1 a, inset). Although still soluble, more material eluted in the void volume at the expense of lower molecular weight forms (Fig. 1 a). It should be noted that because aggregated proteins are likely to assume non-globular shapes, it is not possible to estimate the precise oligomeric state of the soluble G6PDH aggregates (4.Fink A.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 425-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 5.Jaenicke R. Seckler R. Bukau B. Molecular Chaperones and Folding Catalysts. Regulation, Cellular Function and Mechanism. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1999: 407-436Google Scholar). The light scattering intensity of the inactive aggregates stabilized at 47 °C was remarkably low; aggregate concentrations of 0.4 and 2 μm scattered light less than 1 and 7%, respectively, when compared with that of the same protein concentrations denatured at 65 °C (Fig. 1 b). Moreover, following centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min, the majority of the inactive G6PDH remained in solution (data not shown). We conclude that in contrast to the large turbid aggregates formed at 65 °C, the inactive G6PDH species stabilized at 47 °C are virtually non-turbid. As demonstrated by gel filtration chromatography, these species were significantly smaller (consisting of mostly soluble particles) but was nonetheless as stable as large turbid aggregates and did not refold spontaneously (data not shown). Indicative of increased hydrophobic exposure, non-turbid aggregates bound 7 times more bis-ANS than the native enzyme (Fig. 1 c) and 1.5 times more bis-ANS than the turbid aggregates. This implies that non-turbid aggregates exposed more hydrophobic residues than turbid aggregates. bis-ANS binding was proportional to the concentration at which the aggregate was initially stabilized or subsequently diluted (Fig. 1 c). All concentrations of the inactivated G6PDH showed less than 0.1% spontaneous refolding. Moreover, no significant reactivation was observed in the presence of ATP and GroEL/GroES or ClpB or IbpB chaperones (data not shown). However, in the presence of the DnaK system and ATP, a variety of aggregate sizes and concentrations were specifically reactivated after different lag times and at different rates and yields (Fig. 2 a). This demonstrates that several forms of non-turbid G6PDH aggregates are authentic substrates that can be specifically disaggregated and refolded by the DnaK system although in a manner that depends on the size and concentration of the particles. GroEL/GroES failed to reactivate even the smallest G6PDH particles (data not shown) confirming that the size limit for DnaK substrates exceeds that of GroEL substrates (>60 kDa) (3.Bukau B. Horwich A.L. Cell. 1998; 92: 351-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2397) Google Scholar, 20.Goloubinoff P. Christeller J.T. Gatenby A.A. Lorimer G.H. Nature. 1989; 342: 884-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). However, we also found that as the size of the aggregates increased, aggregates became increasingly poorer substrates for the DnaK system. The lag time necessary to reactivate the same low concentration of 50 nmG6PDH by the same concentration of DnaK chaperones (3.5 μm) was 24-fold longer with 2.9 μmaggregated G6PDH than with an 8 times lower concentration of substrate (0.36 μm) (Fig. 2 a, inset). Hence, unlike a classic enzymatic reaction in which the velocity of the reaction with a fixed amount of enzyme increases with the concentration of substrate and becomes maximal in the presence of saturating concentrations of substrate (V max), the reactivation rates carried out by the DnaK system and ATP initially increased up to 0.6 μm G6PDH and then rapidly decreased as the concentration and size of the aggregates increased above 0.6 μm (Fig. 2 b). We found that a 6-fold molar excess of DnaK over the substrate was necessary to obtain optimal folding rates and at least a 3-fold molar excess of DnaK for optimal folding yields. When the DnaK/G6PDH ratio was below 3, the yields rapidly decreased (Fig. 2 b). In the presence of increasing concentrations of non-turbid aggregates, the rate of ATP hydrolysis with a constant concentration of DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE showed an activation of up to 2-fold (Fig. 2 b). This confirms that the small G6PDH aggregates are chaperone substrates that interact with DnaK. The DnaK-ATPase activity initially increased and then decreased with the substrate concentration. Interestingly, the spectrum of the DnaK-ATPase activation matched that of the refolding yields rather than that of the refolding rates (Fig. 2 b). This indicates that the yields of the reaction were affected only when the interaction between the DnaK system and the aggregated substrate was impaired. We next addressed the relationship between the size of the aggregates and their ability to serve as substrates for the DnaK system. Small G6PDH aggregates, initially formed and stabilized at 0.4 μm, were concentrated 20-fold and separated by size-exclusion chromatography (Fig.3 a). Noticeably, the subsequent gel filtration pattern was virtually identical to that obtained for the original preparation (data not shown). 87% of the material was recovered demonstrating that the aggregates were soluble and highly stable. Three discrete fractions of soluble aggregates (fractions A, B, and C) were adjusted to the same final concentration (1 μm) and incubated with the same concentration of the components of the DnaK system and ATP (as in Fig. 2 a). Remarkably, the DnaK system successfully reactivated some 27% of the G6PDH in 2 h although only in the fraction that contained the least complexed aggregates (fraction C). Higher molecular weight aggregates in fractions B and A remained inactive (Fig. 3 b,striped columns). This confirms that the DnaK system efficiently refolds only small protein aggregates. Interestingly, a 5-fold dilution to 200 nm of the aggregates allowed the recovery of some 100 nm G6PDH in fraction C and about half that much in fractions A and B (Fig. 3 b, dotted columns). This suggests that increasing the ratio between the DnaK system and the substrates can compensate for the decreased ability of the DnaK system to recognize, disaggregate, and reactivate large protein aggregates. We specifically addressed the role of the ratio between DnaK and large aggregates on the efficiency of the chaperone system. The refolding activity was measured with two types of G6PDH aggregates: small aggregates generated at 0.4 μmthat were subsequently concentrated to 2 μm or large non-turbid aggregates that were directly generated at 2 μm. The yield of chaperone-mediated reactivation of small aggregates (formed at 0.4 μm and concentrated thereafter to 1 μm) was 2 times higher than with the same amount (1 μm) of large aggregates formed at 2 μm and diluted thereafter (Fig.4 a). However, the same concentration of chaperone became equally efficient at reactivating a 5-fold smaller amount (0.2 μm) of aggregated G6PDH regardless of the particle size (Fig. 4 b). Gel filtration confirmed that neither concentrated small aggregates (0.4 μm) nor diluted large aggregates (2 μm) changed oligomeric state during concentration or dilution (Fig. 4, a and b, insets) indicating that both oligomeric structure and the concentration of the aggregate determine the efficiency of the chaperone system. The dependence of the chaperone efficiency on the size and concentration of the aggregate was further addressed over a wide range of concentrations (0.05–2.0 μm) of the small and large types of aggregates described above (Fig. 4 c). At concentrations up to 0.6 μm G6PDH (a DnaK/G6PDH ratio of >6), the reaction yield was independent of the oligomeric state of the aggregate, but when the substrate concentration exceeded 0.6 μm (a DnaK/G6PDH of <6) the reaction yields strongly decreased. The decrease of the chaperone efficiency was more dramatic with large aggregates than with small aggregates. At 2 μmsubstrate, the reactivation yields of the reaction with large aggregates was 4 times lower than with small aggregates. This suggests that productive refolding requires concomitant interactions of several chaperone molecules with the same polypeptide within a large aggregate. We further addressed the possibility that limiting DnaK concentrations account for the observed low chaperone efficiency with high aggregate concentrations. The low refolding rates and yields of the reaction of large aggregates (2 μm) were dramatically improved when the DnaK concentration was increased by a factor of 3 from 3.5 to 10 μm (the DnaJ and GrpE remained unchanged). A similar effect was observed when 6.5 μm DnaK was supplemented 150 min after initiation of poorly productive refolding to the initial 3.5 μm DnaK (Fig.5 a). This indicates that the ratio between DnaK and the substrate determines the effectiveness of the interaction of the DnaK system with large aggregates. Refolding was similarly improved when the concentration of all three components of the DnaK system was proportionally increased (see below) indicating that the effect primarily depends on the DnaK concentration relative to the substrate rather than on the ratio between DnaK and its co-chaperones, DnaJ and GrpE. When inefficient refolding of high molecular weight aggregates (2 μm) with 3.5 μm DnaK (and 0.7 μm DnaJ and 0.35 μm GrpE) was tested in the presence of a substoichiometric level of the ClpB chaperone (0.5 μm), both rates and yields of reactivation were dramatically increased (Fig. 5 b). The effect of 0.5 μm ClpB concentrations was similar to that of 10 μm DnaK. In contrast to non-turbid G6PDH particles, a low concentration of large turbid particles (0.4 μm) formed at 65 °C was not reactivated by 3.5 μm DnaK and was only poorly reactivated by 10 μm DnaK (Fig. 5 c). Only in the presence of 0.5 μm ClpB and 3.5 μm DnaK (and 0.7 μm DnaJ and 0.35 μm GrpE) were the turbid particles reactivated 8 times faster, reaching yields 7 times higher than in the presence of 10 μm DnaK without ClpB. Thus, ClpB appears to render the large turbid aggregates much more compatible for subsequent disaggregation by the DnaK system. Moreover, ClpB significantly reduced the amount of DnaK needed for the disaggregation of non-turbid aggregates and was absolutely essential for the disaggregation of large turbid aggregates. We tested the ability of 3.5 μm DnaK (and its co-chaperones) to refold increasing concentrations and sizes of aggregate particles with or without ClpB (Fig. 5 d). The presence of ClpB nearly doubled the recovery of the small aggregates. Remarkably, the ClpB was most effective at alleviating ineffective refolding of large non-turbid aggregates at concentrations of up to 2.9 μm by the DnaK system alone. In the case of the large aggregates, the refolding yields were 28-fold higher than without ClpB (Fig. 5 d, inset). This demonstrates that in the presence of substoichiometric amounts of ClpB, the yields of DnaK-mediated disaggregation and reactivation become equally optimal with all forms of aggregates from small non-turbid to infinitely large turbid aggregates. Thus, confirming initial observations on large aggregates of malate dehydrogenase (12.Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Peres Ben-Zvi A. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 23: 13732-13737Crossref Scopus (497) Google Scholar), ClpB alleviates the dependence of the DnaK chaperone machinery on the size and of the aggregated substrates. The effect of ClpB was confirmed when the refolding yields were analyzed in the presence of increasing concentrations of DnaK (and proportionally of DnaJ and GrpE), without or with ClpB (Fig.5 e). Without ClpB, half of the maximal refolding was reached in the presence of about a 4-fold molar excess of DnaK over G6PDH, whereas a near equimolar amount of DnaK sufficed in the presence of ClpB. This can be interpreted as if ClpB increased the apparent affinity of DnaK for the aggregates by increasing the ability of DnaK molecules to interact with the aggregates. During the denaturation of a native protein, unstable folding intermediates that escape chaperone binding may reach an alternatively stable state of inactive insoluble aggregates (5.Jaenicke R. Seckler R. Bukau B. Molecular Chaperones and Folding Catalysts. Regulation, Cellular Function and Mechanism. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1999: 407-436Google Scholar). Stable aggregates remain refractory to subsequent attempts of in vitroreactivation by most individual chaperone systems such as GroELS or DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE (8.Schröder H. Langer T. Hartl F.-U. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4137-4144Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 9.Glover J.R. Lindquist S.

Only in the specific case of heat-inactivated RNA polymerase was the DnaK chaperone system fromE. coli and ATP able to mediate efficient disaggregation and reactivation, an exceptional activity that was attributed to an undefined “mild” nature of the aggregate (6.Skowyra D. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. Cell. 1990; 62: 939-944Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 7.Ziemienowicz A. Skowyra D. Zeilstra-Ryalls J. Fayet O. Georgopoulos C. Zylicz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25425-25431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To better characterize the nature of the protein aggregates that can effectively serve as chaperone substrates and be specifically solubilized by the DnaK system, we developed a method to generate various populations of stable aggregates of G6PDH with a controlled spectrum of particle sizes. These range from small soluble non-turbid aggregates to large yet mostly soluble non-turbid aggregates to even larger and insoluble turbid aggregates. The G6PDH aggregates were stable both in their oligomeric structure and in their ability to serve as chaperone substrates. They did not refold spontaneously. Size-exclusion chromatography indicated a complexity that was unaffected by dilution or concentration. Similar refolding efficiencies were obtained when chaperones were added immediately or following hours of delay. bis-ANS binding was strictly proportional to the concentration of the protein. Hence, the general hydrophobic exposure of the aggregate surfaces was unaffected by the complexity and concentration of the aggregate. Because increasingly larger globular particles display decreasing surface/volume ratios, a constant ratio suggests that G6PDH aggregates are mostly elongated filaments typical of many protein aggregates (4.Fink A.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 425-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar, 5.Jaenicke R. Seckler R. Bukau B. Molecular Chaperones and Folding Catalysts. Regulation, Cellular Function and Mechanism. Harwood Academic Publishers, Amsterdam1999: 407-436Google Scholar). Remarkably, the large turbid aggregates formed at 65 °C exposed fewer hydrophobic residues, thus suggesting more collapsed and compact structures. Because hydrophobic residues are core elements of the DnaK and DnaJ binding sites (21.Rüdiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), we expected that fewer chaperone molecules would be able to interact with insoluble turbid aggregates than with soluble non-turbid aggregates. This was confirmed by substrate-induced activation of the DnaK ATPase. Whereas DnaK strongly interacted with small non-turbid aggregates, interaction decreased with large non-turbid aggregates and was negligible with very large turbid aggregates (data not shown). The interaction of the DnaK system with small non-turbid aggregates was highly productive in terms of protein reactivation. This implies that unlike GroELS chaperonins, the DnaK system can bind locally and initiate assisted refolding in a local region of a polypeptide while still being involved in strong protein-protein interactions within the aggregate. Noticeably, protein reactivation by the DnaK system became increasingly futile as the complexity of the aggregate increased and the hydrophobic exposure decreased. This can be attributed to the reduced exposure of chaperone binding sites in large non-turbid aggregates and in turbid aggregates when compared with small soluble aggregates. Consistent with this interpretation is our finding that at the same concentration of aggregates (1 μm) only the fraction containing the lowest mass (not the medium or large soluble aggregates isolated by gel filtration chromatography) was efficiently refolded by the DnaK system. On the other hand, although dilution did not affect the complexity of large aggregates, the yields of refolding were about 50 times higher with 0.2 μm than with 1 μm of the same large aggregates (Fig. 3, fractions A and B). Thus, a higher ratio of DnaK per G6PDH can compensate for the decreased efficiency of reactivation of large aggregates. Indeed, large aggregates were efficiently reactivated when the DnaK concentration was increased to a 5-fold excess (10 μm) over the substrate. A non-physiological increase of the concentration of only DnaJ or GrpE resulted in a strong inhibition of the chaperone activity with all types of aggregates (data not shown). However, as with DnaK alone, the inhibited reactivation was similarly alleviated by the concomitant increase in DnaK, DnaJ, and GrpE levels while keeping a fixed ratio of 10:2:1 between the respective members of the chaperone system (Fig.5 e). Moreover, the dose response of the DnaK system indicates that in the absence of ClpB, the mechanism of productive disaggregation requires some sort of a cooperative behavior between different DnaK molecules because efficient refolding requires that more than one chaperone molecule interacts at the same time with the same polypeptide within the aggregate. Because the algorithm of Rüdiger et al.(21.Rüdiger S. Germeroth L. Schneider-Mergener J. Bukau B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1501-1507Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar) predicts as many as 12 putative high affinity DnaK-binding sites, several DnaK molecules can theoretically bind to the same G6PDH polypeptide. Our data, however, suggest that as the aggregates became larger and more turbid, more sites seemingly became buried within the structure and were less available for DnaK binding. A combination of the yeast chaperones hsp104, hsp70, and hsp40 initially demonstrated some disaggregation activity in vitroand solubilization of pre-aggregated proteins (9.Glover J.R. Lindquist S. Cell. 1998; 94: 73-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). The hsp104 homologue, ClpB, was further demonstrated to interact directly with large turbid protein aggregates, and together with ATP it induced structural changes in the aggregates. Hydrophobic regions became transiently exposed and available for subsequent interactions with the DnaK system leading to efficient disaggregation activity (12.Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Peres Ben-Zvi A. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 23: 13732-13737Crossref Scopus (497) Google Scholar). We demonstrate in this study that for efficient solubilization of large aggregates the presence of ClpB reduces the need for an excess of DnaK. A dose response of the DnaK system in the presence of a constant concentration of substrate suggests that efficient reactivation with ClpB requires 4–5 times less DnaK per substrate than reactivation without ClpB. There is no obvious Hsp100 homologue in the complete genome ofDrosophila melanogaster. Our finding that protein disaggregation can take place with large amounts of Hsp70 even without Hsp100 correlates well with the exceptionally high levels of Hsp70 found in Drosophila under stress. Interestingly, Hsp70 overexpression suppresses polyglutamine aggregate-mediated neurodegeneration in Drosophila (31.Warrick J.M. Chan H.Y. Gray-Board G.L. Chai Y. Paulson H.L. Bonini N.M. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). In the presence of ClpB, the mechanism of productive disaggregation exempts the DnaK molecules from having to act in an apparent cooperative manner (Fig.5 e). We suggest a two-step cooperative mechanism for the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE-mediated solubilization and reactivation of stable protein aggregates. During the first step, several DnaK molecules must initially interact with exposed hydrophobic regions preferentially in the same aggregated polypeptide and thus prevent intramolecular collapses and intermolecular re-aggregation. During the second step, a dynamic binding and release of DnaK in the presence of DnaJ, GrpE, and ATP allows folding of previously bound regions, whereas the rest of the molecule is maintained in a partially non-collapsed state by other bound DnaK molecules. This would explain the observed apparent cooperative effect between DnaK molecules, which was canceled in the presence of ClpB. In Ref. 12.Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Peres Ben-Zvi A. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 23: 13732-13737Crossref Scopus (497) Google Scholar, we proposed a mechanism in which ClpB hexamers shear ClpB-bound aggregates and thus actively expose some of the hidden hydrophobic regions on the aggregates. Hence, although through a different mechanism, ClpB could maintain aggregated polypeptides in a partially non-collapsed state and thus functionally surrogate the holding role otherwise carried out by excess DnaK. ClpB activity would thus free the excess DnaK molecules to instead perform repetitive cycles of productive assisted refolding (with DnaJ and GrpE) on local exposed regions in the aggregated polypeptide, leading to efficient disaggregation and renaturation. Together with the evidence that the DnaK system alone can bind and initiate the folding of polypeptides that are still aggregated, the efficient folding of large aggregates by near stoichiometric amounts of DnaK in the presence of ClpB strongly suggests that the mechanism of DnaK involves repetitive cycles of local rather than global assisted folding. In the cell, the efficient rescue of thermolabile proteins during and after stress depends on the nature of the unfolded intermediates generated by each protein and on the availability and specificity of the various components of the chaperone network for unfolding intermediates. Thus, GroEL may preferentially interact with partially denatured molten globules (22.Martin J. Langer T. Boteva R. Schramel A. Horwich A.L. Hartl F.U. Nature. 1991; 352: 36-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), IbpB with extensively unfolded proteins (17.Veinger L. Diamant S. Buchner J. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11032-11037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), and ClpB with large turbid aggregates (12.Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Peres Ben-Zvi A. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 23: 13732-13737Crossref Scopus (497) Google Scholar). In contrast, the DnaK system may interact with small segments of about 8–9 residues in extensively unfolded proteins (23.Rüdiger S. Buchberger A. Bukau B. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 342-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar) as well as in exposed polypeptide loops within large yet non-turbid protein aggregates (this work). Because the DnaK system interacts with small extended segments, this chaperone system has been initially assigned to an early stage in the sequential folding pathway of nascent and newly translocated proteins prior to GroEL/GroES chaperonins (24.Hendrick J.P. Hartl F.U. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1559-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). However, other studies have shown that the DnaK system can efficiently process folding intermediates handled from small heat shock proteins (17.Veinger L. Diamant S. Buchner J. Goloubinoff P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11032-11037Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), components of the import complex of organelles (25.Hohfeld J. Hartl F.-U. Curr. Opin.

Biol. 1996; 261: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In addition, the DnaK system functionally cooperates with trigger factor (28.Deuerling E. Schulze-Specking A. Tomoyasu T. Mogk A. Bukau B. Nature. 1999; 400: 693-696Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), Hsp90 (29.Freeman B.C. Morimoto R.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2969-2979Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar), and ClpB (12.Goloubinoff P. Mogk A. Peres Ben-Zvi A. Tomoyasu T. Bukau B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6934-6949Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). Our finding that small aggregates can be actively solubilized by the DnaK machinery has a major consequence for the role of the DnaK system within the chaperone network of the cell. It can (i) receive and process soluble intermediates from import pores, ribosomes, and other chaperones, (ii) resolubilize early forms of aggregates that accidentally form as by-products of the folding activity of other chaperones such as GroEL/GroES (30.Todd M.J. Viitanen P.V. Lorimer G.H. Science. 1994; 265: 659-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar), and (iii) disaggregate small size aggregates generated during stress. Thus the hsp70 system can reintroduce polypeptides trapped in small aggregates back into the chaperone network for refolding or into the protease network for degradation. We thank H-J.

Recent evidence (Sano, H., Sohma, H., Muta, T., Nomura, S., Voelker, D. R., and Kuroki, Y. (1999) J.

In this report we examined the structural elements of the lung collectins involved in CD14 recognition and the consequences for CD14/LPS interaction. Rat SP-A and SP-D bound CD14 in a concentration-dependent manner. Mannose and EDTA inhibited SP-D binding to CD14 but did not decrease SP-A binding. The SP-A binding to CD14 was completely blocked by a monoclonal antibody that binds to the SP-A neck domain but only partially blocked by an antibody that binds to the SP-A lectin domain. SP-A but not SP-D bound to deglycosylated CD14. SP-D decreased CD14 binding to both smooth and rough LPS, whereas SP-A enhanced CD14 binding to rough LPS and inhibited binding to smooth LPS. SP-A also altered the migration profile of LPS on a sucrose density gradient in the presence of CD14. From these results, we conclude that 1) lung collectins bind CD14, 2) the SP-A neck domain and SP-D lectin domain participate in CD14 binding, 3) SP-A recognizes a peptide component and SP-D recognizes a carbohydrate moiety of CD14, and 4) lung collectins alter LPS/CD14 interactions.

Lung collectins are now thought to be important components of the innate immune system of the lung (26.Wright J.R. Physiol.

Mice homozygous for null alleles of SP-A exhibit increased susceptibility to group B streptococcal and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections (29.LeVine A.M. Bruno M.D. Huelsman K.M. Ross G.F.

Biol. 1999; 20: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). These mice clear the bacteria from the lungs at a slower rate than wild-type mice. Phagocytosis of P. aeruginosa by alveolar macrophages in SP-A−/− mice is also significantly decreased (30.LeVine A.M. Kurak K.E. Bruno M.D. Stark J.M. Whitsett J.A. Korfhagen T.M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 1998; 19: 700-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Coadministration of SP-A with bacteria into the airway of SP-A−/− mice enhance phagocytosis of the bacteria by alveolar macrophages. Secretion of proinflammatory cytokines into the alveolar space is significantly elevated in SP-A−/− mice compared with SP-A+/+ mice after intratracheal challenge with P. aeruginosa. These studies suggest that SP-A modulates innate immune responses by several different mechanisms. Although these in vivo studies explicitly indicate that SP-A plays a crucial role in host defense of the lung, the molecular basis of SP-A-mediated modification of inflammatory responses remains to be elucidated. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), derived from Gram-negative bacteria, is a potent stimulator of inflammation (32.Ulevitch R.J. Tobias P.S. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1995; 13: 437-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (1312) Google Scholar). Smooth LPS is composed ofO-antigen, core oligosaccharides, and lipid A, while rough LPS lacks O-antigen and a part of the core oligosaccharides (33.Hancock R.E.W. Karunaratne K. Bernegger-Egli C. Ghuysen J.M. Hakenbeck R. Molecular Organization and Structual Role of Outer Membrane Macromolecules: New Comprehensive Biochemistry, Bacterial Cell Wall. 27. Elsevier Science B. V., Amsterdam1994: 263-276Google Scholar). The cellular responses to physiological amounts of LPS depend on membrane CD14 that is phosphatidylinositol-anchored to the plasma membrane of myeloid cells (34.Wright S.D. Ramos R.A. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. Mathison J.C. Science. 1990; 21: 1431-1433Crossref Scopus (3351) Google Scholar). A soluble form of CD14 which exists in serum also facilitates the responsiveness of the cells to LPS (35.Hailman E. Vasselon T. Kelly M. Busse L.A. Hu M.C.T., S., L.H. Detmers P.A. Wright S.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4384-4390PubMed Google Scholar, 36.Frey E.A. Miller D.S. Jahr T.G. Sundan A. Brazil V. Espevik T. Finlay B.B. Wright S.D. J. Exp. Med. 1992; 176: 1665-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). The principal role of CD14 is to bind LPS, but how CD14 acts in transmitting LPS signal remains to be resolved. Recently, Toll-like receptors have been implicated in signaling by LPS and CD14 (37.Yang R.B. Mark M.R. Gray A. Huang A. Hong Xie M. Zhang M. Goddard A. Wood W.I. Gurney A.L. Godowski P.J.

Invest. 1992; 90: 97-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 40.Van Iwaarden J.F. Pikaar J.C. Storm J. Brouwer E. Verhoef J. Oosting R.S. Van Golde L.M.G. Van Strip J.A.G. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that human SP-A and its collagenase-resistant fragment bind to lipid A and rough LPS but not to smooth LPS (41.Sano H. Sohma H. Muta T. Nomura S. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 387-395PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, human SP-A interacts directly with CD14, and modulates the LPS-induced cellular responses (41.Sano H. Sohma H. Muta T. Nomura S. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 387-395PubMed Google Scholar). In the macrophage-like cell line U937 and alveolar macrophages, SP-A inhibits expression and secretion of tumor necrosis factor α induced by smooth LPS. Preincubation of CD14 with SP-A prevents CD14 binding to smooth LPS. The disruption of smooth LPS-CD14 interaction by SP-A may play an important role in reducing inflammatory responsiveness of the lung to smooth LPS. In contrast, the binding of CD14 to rough LPS is significantly increased by the preincubation of CD14 with SP-A. Moreover, the cellular response to rough LPS can be enhanced by SP-A. From the results, we hypothesize that rough LPS, which is a ligand for both CD14 and SP-A, might more effectively bind to the SP-A-CD14 complex. The purpose of the current study was to extend our examination of lung collectin interactions with LPS and CD14 by investigating: 1) the interaction of SP-D with CD14, 2) the structural determinants that participate in SP-D/CD14 recognition, and 3) the structural determinants involved in SP-A/CD14 interaction. These studies provide clear evidence that SP-A and SP-D bind CD14 by different mechanisms and alter LPS/CD14 interaction. Rough LPS from Salmonella minnesotaRe595 was purchased from Sigma. 3H-Labeled LPS (587 cpm/ng) from Escherichia coli K12 LCD25 (Rb) was obtained from List Biological Laboratories Inc. (Cambell, CA). Trans35S-labelTM was from ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Costa Mesa, CA). Surfactant was isolated from lung lavage fluid of Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (7.Hawgood S. Benson B. Hamilton R.J. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 184-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar) that had been given an intratracheal instillation of silica in saline 4 weeks before the lavage (42.Dethloff L.A. Gilmore L.B. Brody A.R. Hook G.E.R. Biochem. J. 1986; 233: 111-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The surfactant was delipidated with 1-butanol. SP-A was isolated and purified from the delipidated surfactant by mannose-Sepharose 6B column chromatography followed by gel filtration over Bio-Gel A-5m as described previously (43.Kuroki Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5566-5570Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). SP-D was also purified from rat lung lavage as described previously (44.Kuroki Y. Shiratori M. Murata Y. Akino T. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 115-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 45.Ogasawara Y. Kuroki Y. Akino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21244-21249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For biotinylation, 150 μg of SP-A was incubated for 30 min at room temperature in 0.5 ml of 0.1 m NaHCO3 buffer (pH 8.3) containing N-hydroxysulfosuccinimidobiotin (Sulfo-NHS-biotin) (Pierce) at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. The protein was then dialyzed against 5 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) and stored at −20 °C. Monoclonal antibodies 1D6 and 6E3 were prepared against rat SP-A as described previously (46.Kuroki Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3388-3394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibodies recognize epitopes in the polypeptide portion of SP-A and have nearly equivalent affinity for the SP-A antigen. The epitopes for antibodies 1D6 and 6E3 have been localized at the CRD and the neck domain, respectively (Fig.1) (12.Kuroki Y. McCormack F.X. Ogasawara Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29793-29800Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The isolation and sequencing of the 1.6-kilobase cDNA for rat SP-A was described previously (47.Sano K. Fisher J. Mason R.J. Kuroki Y. Schilling J. Benson B. Voelker D.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 144: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The isolation of the 1.2-kilobase cDNA for rat SP-D was also previously reported (48.Shimizu H. Fisher J.H. Papst P. Benson B. Lau K. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1853-1857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The SP-A/SP-D chimeraad5 containing the SP-A region Asn1-Met134 and the SP-D region Cys261-Phe355 was also constructed as described previously (13.Sano H. Kuroki Y. Honma T. Ogasawara Y. Sohma H. Voelker D.R. Akino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4783-4789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of SP-A, SP-D, and chimera ad5. Chimera ad5 exhibits defects of binding dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and galactosylceramide and interacting with alveolar type II cells but exhibits the phosphatidylinositol and glucosylceramide binding property of SP-D (13.Sano H.

The proteins were expressed in the baculovirus expression system by the methods of O'Reilly et al. (49.O'Reilly D.R. Miller L.K. Luckow V.A. Baculovirus Expression Vector, A Laboratory Manual. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1992Google Scholar), using monolayers ofSpodoptera frugiperda cells and Trichoplusia ni(Tni) cells as described previously (13.Sano H. Kuroki Y. Honma T. Ogasawara Y. Sohma H. Voelker D.R. Akino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4783-4789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For labeling SP-A with Trans35S-label, the infected cells were incubated in serum-free medium containing 500 μCi/ml Trans35S-labelTM. After the incubation for 3 days, the medium was applied to a mannose-Sepharose column in the presence of 2 mm CaCl2. The labeled protein was eluted with 5 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2 mm EDTA. The specific activity of 35S-labeled SP-A was approximately 25 cpm/ng. Electrophoretic analysis revealed that the forms of 35S-labeled SP-A correlated well with the forms of unlabeled protein. The construction of recombinant soluble CD14H in which the carboxyl end and the glycosylphophatidylinositol-anchoring site of CD14 were replaced with a protein kinase A site and a 6-histidine tag, was performed by a modified method based on that described by Tapping and Tobias (50.Tapping R.I. Tobias P.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23157-23164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The expression of CD14H protein in the baculovirus expression system was performed by the method (13.Sano H. Kuroki Y. Honma T. Ogasawara Y. Sohma H. Voelker D.R. Akino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4783-4789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) described above for recombinant collectins. After incubation of Tni cells with recombinant viruses for 3 days, the medium was collected after low-speed centrifugation and dialyzed against 0.1 m Tris buffer (pH 8.0) containing 0.3 m NaCl. The dialyzed medium was filtered and CD14H was purified by a column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. The purified protein was finally dialyzed against 5 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl and stored at −20 °C. Approximately 1 mg of CD14H protein was obtained from 230 ml of medium. The cDNA for CD14H was also ligated into a pEE14 plasmid vector (51.Ausbel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman L.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992Google Scholar). The recombinant CD14H was expressed in CHO cells using the glutamine synthetase amplification system (51.Ausbel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman L.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1992Google Scholar). The pEE14 vector containing CD14H cDNA was transfected into CHO-K1 cells using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Transfected cells were incubated in glutamine-free Glasgow minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (complete Glasgow minimum essential medium-10) in the presence of 25 μm methionine sulfoximine (Sigma) for 2 weeks and resistant cell lines were cloned. A stable cell line that secretes CD14H was obtained and maintained in the presence of 250 μm methionine sulfoximine. To produce soluble CD14H, the cloned cells (0.5 × 106/100-mm dish) were incubated in complete Glasgow minimum essential medium-10 for 4 days until reaching 70% confluency and then changed to serum-free media ExCell302 (JRH Biosciences). After 3–4 days incubation, the medium was collected, dialyzed, and applied to a column of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads. The CD14H was then isolated as described above. Approximately 1.5 mg of CD14H protein was obtained from 200 ml of medium. Protein concentrations were estimated by the BCA assay (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard. Protein samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (13%) by the method of Laemmli (52.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The binding of recombinant SP-A and SP-D to Re-LPS was performed by the method described previously (41.Sano H. Sohma H. Muta T. Nomura S. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 387-395PubMed Google Scholar). The protein binding to LPS was detected using anti-SP-A IgG or anti-SP-D IgG and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled anti-rabbit IgG. The peroxidase reaction was performed by usingo-phenylenediamine as a substrate and the absorbance was measured at 492 nm. 35S-SP-A was used to determine the effect of monoclonal antibodies on the binding of SP-A to LPS. 35S-SP-A (5 μg/ml) was preincubated at 37 °C for 1 h in the presence or absence of 50 μg/ml monoclonal antibody 1D6 or 6E3 in 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 5 mm CaCl2. The mixture of SP-A and antibody (50 μl) was then incubated with Re-LPS coated onto microtiter wells. After incubation for 5 h, the wells were washed, and 100 μl of 0.1 n NaOH solution was added to the wells. The suspended NaOH solution was transferred to vials and mixed with scintillation liquid. The radioactivity of each vial was measured using a β-radiation counter. The binding of SP-A and SP-D to CD14H coated onto microtiter wells was performed by the method described previously (41.Sano H. Sohma H. Muta T. Nomura S. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 387-395PubMed Google Scholar). The protein binding to the CD14 was detected using anti-SP-A IgG or anti-SP-D IgG and HRP-labeled anti-rabbit IgG. Anti-SP-D IgG was used to detect chimera ad5 binding to CD14H since this polyclonal antibody binds chimera ad5 strongly (13.Sano H. Kuroki Y. Honma T. Ogasawara Y. Sohma H. Voelker D.R. Akino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4783-4789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The ligand blot analysis was carried out by the method (41.Sano H. Sohma H. Muta T. Nomura S. Voelker D.R. Kuroki Y. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 387-395PubMed Google Scholar) described previously with minor modifications. CD14H (1.5–4 μg) was electrophoresed and transferred to PVDF membrane. The nonspecific binding was blocked with 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 5% (w/v) BSA, and 1% (w/v) polyvinylpyrrolidone (binding buffer). The membrane was then incubated at room temperature overnight with 0.5–20 μg/ml native SP-A or SP-D in the binding buffer. The membranes were then washed and incubated with anti-SP-A IgG or anti-SP-D IgG for 90 min, followed by the incubation with HRP-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1:1000) for 90 min. SP-A or SP-D that had bound to the PVDF membrane was visualized by using chemiluminescence reagent (NEN Life Science Products Inc.). In some experiments 10 μg/ml biotinylated SP-A which had been preincubated at room temperature for 2 h in the absence or presence of monoclonal antibody 1D6 or 6E3, or control antibody 6B2 (100 μg/ml) was incubated with CD14H transferred onto the PVDF membrane at room temperature overnight. The membrane was washed and further incubated with HRP-conjugated streptavidin D (1:1000) for 20 min. After washing with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, the peroxidase reaction was performed by using diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride as a substrate. For CD14 expressed in insect cells, the protein (1.5 μg) was incubated with 1 unit ofN-glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) at 37 °C for 2 h in 10 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 10 mm EDTA, 2% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, and 1% Nonidet P-40 (denaturing buffer). For CD14 expressed in CHO cells, the protein (4 μg) was incubated with 1 unit ofN-glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 10 units of neuraminidase (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 1 milliunit ofO-glycosidase at 37 °C for 90 min in the denaturing buffer described above. The 5–30% (w/v) sucrose gradient was prepared by overlaying 0.25 ml of each step varying by 2.5% sucrose concentration above a bottom cushion of 0.5 ml of 40% sucrose. Forty ng of 3H-LPS was incubated in the absence or presence of wild type rat SP-A (20 μg) and/or CD14H (20 μg) at 37 °C for 1 h in 200 μl of 20 mm Tris buffer (pH 7.4) containing 0.15 m NaCl and 2 mmCaCl2. Then 50 μl of 12.5% sucrose was added to each incubated sample to adjust a final sucrose concentration at 2.5%, and the samples were applied to the top of the gradient. The gradients were centrifuged at room temperature at 30,000 rpm for 90 min by using RPS 56T rotor (Hitachi Koki Co., Tokyo, Japan). The fractions were collected from the top of the gradient by careful vacuum aspiration. The collected fractions were mixed with scintillation liquid, and the radioactivity of each fraction was measured using a β-counter. Recovery of 3H-LPS ranged from 70 to 95% under all conditions.

The cDNA for human CD14 was isolated from differentiated U937 cells and was engineered to replace the carboxyl end and the putative glycosylphophatidylinositol anchoring site with a protein kinase A site and a 6-histidine tag by the method described by Tapping and Tobias (50.Tapping R.I.

Recombinant CD14 (CD14H) was purified by affinity chromatography on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads. The purified proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig.2). The wt SP-A migrated as a polymorphic band at approximately 30 kDa under reducing conditions. Recombinant SP-A produced in insect cells typically migrated faster than native SP-A derived from lung lavage due to different post-translational modifications as described previously (53.McCormack F.X.

Pro-apoptotic stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) or Fas induce its caspase-8-mediated cleavage into two fragments. The COOH-terminal cleavage fragment of Bid (tBid) becomes localized to mitochondrial membranes and triggers the release of cytochrome c. Here we show that tBid is ubiquitinated and subsequently degraded by the 26 S proteasome. Degradation of tBid is significantly inhibited by the proteasome inhibitors MG-132 and lactacystin. In contrast, caspase-specific or lysosomal inhibitors do not affect tBid stability. Furthermore, mutation of the putative ubiquitin acceptor sites within tBid results in a stabilized protein as assessed by pulse-chase analysis. To address whether tBid degradation might be regulated by interaction with other Bcl-2-like proteins, cotransfection studies were performed. However, neither the presence of proapoptotic Bax nor antiapoptotic Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL affected tBid degradation. Finally, we determined the functional role of tBid degradation. Overexpression of stabilized tBid proteins significantly enhanced cytochrome c release and subsequent apoptosis induction approximately 2-fold compared with wild type tBid. Similarly, tBid-induced apoptosis was considerably amplified by inhibition of tBid degradation using the proteasome-specific inhibitor MG-132. Thus, proteasomal degradation of tBid limits the extent of apoptosis in living cells. Under basal conditions, the proapoptotic protein Bid is a long-lived protein.

Bcl-2 homology domain tumor necrosis factor-α cleaved COOH-terminal fragment of Bid wild type hemagglutinin Programmed cell death is critical for the successful development of multiple tissues and the maintenance of normal tissue homeostasis. The signaling pathways involved in apoptosis have been extensively studied (1.Gaiewski T.F. Thompson C.B.

Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Key regulatory proteins in apoptotic events are the Bcl-2 family of proteins, which can either improve cell survival (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, A1, Mcl-1, Bcl-W) or promote cell death (Bax, Bak, Bcl-XS, and Bok) (2.Arch R.H. Gedrich R.W. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2821-2830Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). These molecules are characterized by the presence of several conserved motifs, described as the Bcl-2 homology domains (BH domains) 1 (7.Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (4819) Google Scholar). The domains are required for the intermolecular association of Bcl-2 protein family members. A new set of proapoptotic Bcl-2 protein family members that possess only one conserved Bcl-2 homology domain, the death-promoting BH3 domain, has been recently identified. These proteins are called the “BH3 domain-only” molecules, which include Bid, Bik, Bad, Hrk, Bim, Blk, and EGL-1 of Caenorhabditis elegans (8.Boyd J.M. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Houghton A.B.

Cell. 1998; 93: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). The BH3 domain-only protein Bid is localized in the cytosolic fraction of cells as an inactive precursor (15.Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar, 16.Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3798) Google Scholar). Its active form is generated upon proteolytic cleavage by caspase-8 in response to treatment with TNFα or anti-Fas. Human Bid is cleaved at aspartic acid 60 after the LQTD site, and thereby, a truncated COOH-terminal cleavage fragment is produced, referred as tBid (Fig. 1). tBid translocates to mitochondria and induces cytochrome crelease. Thereby, Bid relays an apoptotic signal from the cell surface to mitochondria (15.Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar, 16.Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J.

J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1156-1163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar). However, the precise molecular mechanism responsible for the translocation of tBid onto mitochondrial membranes and for the subsequent release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol during apoptosis is still unknown. In addition to transcriptional regulation, protein stability of Bcl-2 members also plays an important regulatory role for cell survival. For instance, interleukin-3 withdrawal- or Fas-induced caspase-mediated cleavage of Bcl-2 considerably affects susceptibility to apoptosis in Jurkat or Ba/F3 cells (18.Cheng E.H.-Y. Kirsch D.G. Clem R.J. Ravi R. Kastan M.B. Bedi A. Ueno K. Hardwick J.M. Science. 1997; 278: 1966-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Bcl-2 degradation is a key regulatory event in the execution of TNFα-mediated apoptosis in endothelial cells (19.Dimmeler S. Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In these cells, TNFα induces the dephosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitin-dependent degradation of Bcl-2 (20.Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Malchow P. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 20: 1886-1896Crossref Scopus (290) Google Scholar). On the other hand, less is known about the role of stability of proapoptotic Bcl-2 family members in the regulation of apoptosis. It has been reported that proapoptotic Bax is cleaved by calpain in HL60 cells induced to undergo apoptosis (21.Wood D.E. Thomas A. Devi L.A. Berman Y. Beavis R.C. Reed J.C. Newcomb E.W. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1069-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). However, blockage of Bax cleavage did not affect the execution of apoptosis. Alternatively, the Bax protein has been shown to accumulate in the presence of the proteasomal inhibitor MG-132, implicating the ubiquitin proteolytic system in controlling Bax stability (22.Chang Y.C. Lee Y.S. Tejima T. Tanaka K. Omura S. Heintz N.H. Mitsui Y. Magae J. Cell Growth Differ. 1998; 9: 79-84PubMed Google Scholar). The ubiquitin-proteolytic pathway is a major system for selective protein degradation in eukaryotic cells. One of the first steps in this process includes selective modification of ε-NH2 groups of lysine residues in the corresponding protein by ubiquitination, which targets the protein for ubiquitin-dependent degradation by the proteasome complex. Although the mechanisms that underlie this multicatalytic process are very well characterized (23.Hochstrasser M. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 405-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (1461) Google Scholar, 24.Ciechanover A. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1717-2730Crossref Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 25.Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2239) Google Scholar, 26.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6954) Google Scholar), the signals that target proteins for ubiquitination and, therefore, determine their stability are often unclear. In some cases, different patterns of phosphorylation or a partially conserved sequence motif, as shown for mitotic cyclins, other cell cycle regulators, or transcription factors, are required (26.Hershko A. Ciechanover A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 425-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (6954) Google Scholar). The objectives of this study were to identify whether induction of apoptosis is affected by alterations in Bid/tBid stability and to get further insights into the biological function and mechanism of tBid-triggered apoptosis. We demonstrate here that tBid is degraded rapidly by the ubiquitin proteolytic system. Stabilization of tBid either by proteasomal inhibitors or by inactivation of putative ubiquitin acceptor amino acid residues enhances cytochrome crelease and subsequent apoptosis in HeLa cells. Therefore, the life span of tBid appears to act as an important regulatory element in Bid-dependent apoptotic pathways. COS-7 and HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and 2 mml-glutamine. Human wild type (wt) Bid and the COOH-terminal fragment tBid were amplified by polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotides containing EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites and cloned into the respective sites of pcDNA3.1(−)MycHis under the transcriptional control of the cytomegalovirus promoter (Invitrogen, Groningen, The Netherlands). Desired mutant tBid constructs were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany). Human Bax or Bcl-XL were cloned by polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotides containing KpnI and HindIII orApaI and SacI restriction sites, respectively, and subcloned into the respective sites of pcDNA3.1(−) (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands). Human Bcl-2 was amplified and subcloned into pcDNA3.1(-)MycHis (Invitrogen, Groningen, Netherlands) as described recently (19.Dimmeler S. Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Plasmid encoding HA-tagged human ubiquitin was cloned into pcDNA3.1(−). Sequences were determined using an ABI automated sequencer. Transient transfections of COS-7 cells were performed as described previously (19.Dimmeler S. Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids using the calcium phosphate method (27.Sambrook J.E. Fritsch F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) or the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Transfection with FuGENE 6 was carried out according to the instructions of the manufacturer (3.5 × 105cells/6-cm well; 3 μg of plasmid DNA, 6 μl of FuGENE 6 transfection reagent). Cells were lysed as described (19.Dimmeler S. Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Western blots were either performed with anti-Bid antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), anti-myc-antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-cytochromec (Pharmingen, San Diego, CA). To identify ubiquitinated forms of tBid, HeLa, or COS-7 cells, transiently cotransfected with various myc-tagged tBid constructs and HA-tagged ubiquitin in pcDNA3.1(−), were incubated with the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin (10 μm) for 2 h (28.Breitschopf K. Bengal E. Ziv T. Admon A. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5964-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed, and protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method (29.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217486) Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-myc antibody. The immunoprecipitates were resolved via 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and the conjugates were detected using anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). As a control for expression of myc-tagged Bcl-2 protein, Western blot analysis was performed with an anti-myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). 42 h after transfection, HeLa cells were scraped off the plates and pelleted by centrifugation at 800 × g for 10 min. Then cells were resuspended in hypotonic lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated for 3 min on ice. Cells were homogenized with 25 strokes in a dounce homogenizer and centrifuged at 750 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to remove nuclei and unbroken cells. The supernatant was recovered and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the mitochondrial pellet was resolved in 25 μl of lysis buffer. HeLa or COS-7 cells were starved in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without methionine and cysteine for 1 h, then metabolically labeled withl-[35S]methionine andl-[35S]cysteine for 2 h. Cells were then chased in nonradioactive medium for the time periods indicated. Cells were lysed (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1% Triton X-100, 0.32m sucrose) at 4 °C for 20 min. Samples containing equal amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated with an anti-myc antibody. Immunocomplexes were collected using immobilized protein A/G-plus Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and resolved on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gel was dried, and proteins were visualized by a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). For the assay of tBid generation in vivo and its subsequent degradation, cells were incubated for the time periods indicated with 100 ng/ml TNFα and 10 μg/ml cycloheximide. Cell extracts were obtained by lysis of cells in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.32 m sucrose on ice for 20 min. Then homogenates were centrifuged, and the resulting supernatant was used for Western blotting. Proteins (30 μg/lane) were resolved via 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and probed with anti-Bid or anti-myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and ECL was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). DNA fragmentation was demonstrated and quantified by morphological analysis of apoptotic nuclei after fluorescence staining with 4′,6-diamidinophenylidole as described previously (19.Dimmeler S. Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). To determine the influence of the various tBid constructs on apoptosis, HeLa cells were transiently cotransfected with β-galactosidase reporter and test plasmids. Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, and transfected cells were identified by β-galactosidase staining. The percentage of morphologically altered cells typical for apoptotic cell death was determined by phase contrast microscopy and quantified as the number of total blue cells under each condition. Dead versus viable cells were counted by two blinded independent investigators in a total number of 600 cells. Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. from at least 3 independent experiments. Statistical analysis was performed with analysis of variance followed by modified LSD test (SPSS-Software). We previously showed that incubation with TNFα stimulates ubiquitin-dependent breakdown of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 (19.Dimmeler S. Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 20.Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Malchow P. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 20: 1886-1896Crossref Scopus (290) Google Scholar). To identify other apoptosis-related proteins that might influence induction of apoptosis by alterations of protein stability in intact cells, we performed a functional analysis of the life span of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 member Bid and its active COOH-terminal fragment tBid (Fig. 1). COS-7 or HeLa cells were transiently transfected with either myc-tagged Bid or tBid constructs, and pulse-chase analyses were carried out. No significant difference in full-length Bid protein levels could be observed after 1.5 and 3 h chase following metabolic labeling of COS-7 cells (Fig.2, A and B). In contrast, the COOH-terminal fragment tBid was rapidly degraded, resulting in a half life of less than 1.5 h (Fig. 2, Aand B). Caspase-8-mediated cleavage of transiently transfected Bid was induced in intact cells by TNFα and cycloheximide and incubated for the time periods indicated. Whole cell extract containing all subcellular protein fractions was subjected to Western blot analysis. As can be seen in Fig. 2 C, the tBid protein generated by caspase-8-mediated cleavage in intact cells does not accumulate. Rather, it appears to be rapidly degraded. Appropriate subcellular distribution of the transfected Bid and tBid constructs was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy of GFP fusion proteins in which Bid and tBid were tagged COOH-terminally to GFP and by subcellular fractionation (data not shown). Bid reveals a cytosolic localization, whereas tBid is exclusively localized to mitochondrial membranes. To characterize the system involved in tBid degradation, pulse-chase analyses were performed in the presence of various protease inhibitors. Neither the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine nor the caspase-specific inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-dl-Asp-fluoromethylketone affected tBid stability (Fig. 3). However, the proteasome inhibitors MG-132 and lactacystin significantly affected tBid stability (Fig. 3). Furthermore, a tBid construct in which all lysine residues that might act as potential ubiquitin acceptor amino acids were replaced with arginine (Fig. 1) exhibited a significantly extended life-span (Fig. 3). To demonstrate that ubiquitin conjugates were intermediates in the degradation of tBid, COS-7 cells were transiently cotransfected with myc-tagged tBid and HA-tagged ubiquitin and then incubated with the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. Fig. 4illustrates the presence of highly ubiquitinated forms of tBid treated with lactacystin. Similar analysis with COS-7 cells transiently transfected with a tBid construct that lacks all ubiquitin acceptor amino acids (lysine-free tBid or tBidmt) revealed less ubiquitin conjugates (Fig. 4). To demonstrate equal loading and expression of the various tBid constructs, Western blot analysis was carried out with an anti-myc antibody (Fig. 4). The lower intensity of the wt tBid band is due to its increased ubiquitinated forms. These data indicate that ubiquitin conjugates are formed during the degradation of the tBid protein. To explore the functional role of tBid degradation, we examined the extent of apoptosis induction by wt tBid and degradation-resistant tBid constructs in intact cells. Stabilization of wt tBid by MG-132 resulted in a 2-fold increased rate of apoptosis of HeLa cells compared with HeLa cells in which tBid was not stabilized by MG-132 (Fig.5 A). In addition, expression of a degradation-resistant, lysine-free tBid construct resulted in a similar increase in apoptosis of HeLa cells (Fig. 5 A). However, taking into account that the 26 S proteasome complex presents one of the major degradation systems within a cell, overall inhibition of this multi-protease complex could be rather unspecific, as stability of other proteins such as p53 or the inhibitor of NFκB (IκB) are also affected. Thus, it is well known that suppression of the proteasome function by proteasome-specific inhibitors promotes apoptosis (30.Drexler H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 855-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar, 31.Qiu J.H. Asai A. Chi S. Saito N. Hamada H. Kirino T. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 259-265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nevertheless, incubation of mock-transfected HeLa cells with MG-132 for 6 h did not significantly increase apoptosis in HeLa cells (Fig. 5 A), suggesting that the increased apoptotic rate induced by MG-132 in wt tBid-transfected cells is due to the specific stabilization of wt tBid by MG-132. To verify that stability of tBid is indeed a regulatory event in apoptosis induction, the apoptotic rate of HeLa cells transiently transfected with a degradation-resistant, lysine-free tBid construct (tBidmt) was analyzed after treatment with MG-132 for 6 h. Only a slight difference of about 1.5% in the apoptotic rate of HeLa cells treated with MG-132 compared with HeLa cells that were not treated with MG-132 was observed (Fig. 5 A). These data indicate a striking relevance of tBid stability in apoptosis induction. Since tBid was shown to be the molecular adapter between the cytosolic, caspase-8-mediated apoptotic signaling pathway and the mitochondrial death machinery (15.Luo X. Budihardjo I. Zou H. Slaughter C. Wang X. Cell. 1998; 94: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar, 16.Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1381-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the direct influence of stabilized tBid protein on cytochrome c release was examined. Fig.5 B illustrates that stabilized tBid markedly increased cytochrome c translocation from mitochondria to the cytosol. These findings clearly indicate that inhibition of tBid degradation promotes apoptosis. Taken together, the results of this study reveal the following novel findings: (i) Active proapoptotic tBid is an unstable protein that is ubiquitinated and subsequently degraded by the 26 S proteasome, whereas its inactive precursor Bid remains stable. Mutation of putative ubiquitin conjugation sites within tBid results in a stabilized protein, as assessed by pulse-chase analyses. Interestingly, we still observed a slight degradation of the lysine-free tBid construct. This might be due to the fact that a free and exposed NH2terminus can also act as a potential ubiquitin attachment site and, therefore, can stimulate ubiquitin-dependent degradation (28.Breitschopf K. Bengal E. Ziv T. Admon A. Ciechanover A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5964-5973Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). tBid might be such a substrate for N-terminal ubiquitination. Structural analysis of the solution structure of Bid suggests a potential exposed BH3 domain after caspase-8-mediated Bid cleavage (33.Chou J.J. Li H. Salvesen G.S. Yuan J. Wagner G. Cell. 1999; 96: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar,34.McDonnell J.M. Fushman D. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cowburn D. Cell. 1999; 96: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). It is of note that this BH3 domain is located in the very N-terminal part of tBid underlining the existence of a free and exposed NH2 terminus (Fig. 1). Nevertheless, this possibility has still to be tested. (ii) Overexpression of degradation-resistant tBid proteins significantly enhances tBid-induced cytochrome crelease and subsequent apoptosis. Moreover, inhibition of tBid degradation in intact cells potentiates cell death (Fig.5 A). Therefore, one might speculate that the cell is capable of controlling the degradation of tBid, for instance by interaction with a target protein. There are several mitochondrial membrane-located Bcl-2 protein members such as Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, or Bax that are known to interact with tBid through its BH3 domain (10.Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Structural analysis of Bid suggests that caspase-8-mediated cleavage of Bid leads to an exposure of the BH3 death domain, thereby facilitating complex formation of tBid with other Bcl-2 members (33.Chou J.J. Li H. Salvesen G.S. Yuan J. Wagner G. Cell. 1999; 96: 615-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 34.McDonnell J.M. Fushman D. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cowburn D. Cell. 1999; 96: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether these proteins might affect the half-life of tBid. COS-7 cells were transiently cotransfected with tBid and either Bax, Bcl-2, or Bcl-XL, and pulse-chase analyses were performed. However, these studies revealed that Bcl-2 family proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, or Bax do not affect tBid degradation (Fig.6). tBid might be regulated by cytosolic proteins such as 14-3-3, which was shown to regulate the activity of another BH3-containing protein, Bad (35.Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar). However, coimmunoprecipitation studies did not provide evidence for an interaction of tBid with 14-3-3 proteins (data not shown). It is of note that Bid does not contain the known sequence motif required for specific binding to 14-3-3 (36.Yaffe M.B. Rittinger K. Volinia S. Caron P.R. Aitken A. Leffers H. Gamblin S.J. Smerdon S.J. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 91: 961-971Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1353) Google Scholar). Therefore, tBid may interact with an as yet unidentified target, and this protein-protein interaction may co-ordinate tBid degradation. It is also possible that tBid degradation could be activated by classical posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation or dephosphorylation as reported for Bcl-2 (19.Dimmeler S. Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Zeiher A.M. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1815-1822Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 20.Breitschopf K. Haendeler J. Malchow P. Zeiher A.M. Dimmeler S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 20: 1886-1896Crossref Scopus (290) Google Scholar). However, Bid does not contain any potential consensus sequences for kinases like the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases ERK1/2 or Akt kinase, and so far, it is unknown whether Bid is phosphorylated at all. In summary, our study suggests an important regulatory role of tBid stability for cell death. In response to death signals such as TNFα or anti-Fas, caspase-8-mediated cleavage of Bid results in activation of the proapoptotic function of Bid. The present data demonstrate that stability of the cleavage product tBid plays an important role for determining the extent of apoptosis in living cells via cytochromec release. Degradation of tBid by the ubiquitin proteolytic system might therefore alter the extent of apoptosis within a cell and, moreover, may reduce apoptotic cell death. Although the mechanisms of regulating tBid degradation are still enigmatic, our data indicate an important protective role of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway in apoptosis induction by diminishing the level of the proapoptotic protein.

For DNA-PKcs, binding to double strand DNA is essential for its catalytic activity, whereas ATM kinase activity appears mildly enhanced for certain protein substrate targets in the presence of single- and double-stranded DNA.

In mice, DNA-PK deficiencies result in a comparatively milder predisposition for lymphoid malignancies than is observed in ATM−/− animals.

Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (769) Google Scholar). The functional loss phenotypes suggest fundamental differences in the downstream substrates/effectors of DNA-PKcs and ATM. Studies investigating localization have found ATM in both the nucleus and cytoplasm, and the extent of ATM in these locations appears cell-specific. Thus, in proliferating lymphoblastoid cells, ATM is predominantly in the nucleus and less in the cytoplasm, whereas in post-mitotic Purkinje cells, ATM resides almost exclusively in the cytoplasm, suggesting intriguing differences in ATM function and tissue-specific distinctions in ATM-directed signaling pathways (24Watters D.

Lee E.Y. Aguila M.C. Xu Y. Brain Res. 1999; 842: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Since ATM has been shown to be in several locales, this complicates a unifying characterization of ATM-signaling pathways, except for a general dependence on protein kinase activity likely required in most cases (28Chapman C.R. Evans S.T. Carr A.M. Enoch T. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3223-3238Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The multiple, wide ranging disorders resulting from ATM loss of function hint at the impact of ATM upon a multiplicity of biological systems. Some of these disorders, such as development of lymphoid malignancies and Purkinje cell degeneration (in human), on the surface appear only remotely connected. However, the consequences of ATM function, or loss of such even in quite different tissues, may be ultimately related, at least in part, through appropriate regulation of decisions pertaining to cell survival or cell death. Downstream targets of ATM kinase activity that partially delineate DNA damage-activated cell cycle checkpoint signaling pathways have been recently described. The best characterized of these checkpoint pathways involve p53 and Chk2/Cds1, as internally critical components. A DNA damage-induced ATM-dependent p53 activation pathway has been shown to involve direct phosphorylation of Ser15 in p53 by ATM (29Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S. Taya Y. Anderson C.W. Chessa L.

We have employed an oriented degenerate peptide library approach to determine an optimal substrate motif for ATM protein kinase activity. This motif was used as a probe to distinguish ATM and DNA-PK catalytic activities. The peptide library-derived substrate sequence was also utilized in data base searches that identified both previously defined substrates as well as potential downstream targets of ATM. G361, a human melanoma cell line that produces a high level of ATM protein, and C3ABR and L6, two EBV-transformed human B cell lines, have been described previously (29Banin S. Moyal L. Shieh S.

All were grown in RPMI containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals), 200 μm l-Glu and penicillin/streptomycin. The following degenerate peptide libraries were used as substrates in this study: SF, MAXXXXSFXXXXAKKK; SI, MAXXXXXXSIXXXXAKKK; SP, MAXXXXSPXXXXAKKK; RXXS, MAXXXXRXXSXXXXAKKK; SQ, MAXXXXXXXSQXXXXAKKK; S, MAXXXXSXXXXAKKK; T, MAXXXXTXXXXAKKK; 4Y4+/−, MAXXXXYXXXXAKKK (the + and − designations denote the presence or absence of Ser and Thr in the degenerate positions). The SQ library also contains Ser, Thr, and Tyr at degenerate positions. The other Ser-based libraries contained all amino acids but Cys, Trp, Ser, Thr, and Tyr. The Tyr-based libraries contained all amino acids but Cys, Trp, and Tyr, and the + or − signs designate the presence of Ser and Thr. The SQII library is comprised of the following: MA (G,H,R,A)(A,V,F,M,L,Q)(H,A,R)(F,M,Y,A)(Y,F,M,L,V,A)(A,R,P,H,Q,N)(L,Y,N,F,A)SQ(Q,S,R,P,V,E,A)(L,F,P,S,V,Q)(A,Q,F,L)(A,H,N) AKKK. Amino acids at each position are in the parentheses. ATM Protein kinase assays were performed as described (31Sarkaria J.N. Tibbetts R.S. Busby E.C. Kennedy A.P. Hill D.E. Abraham R.T.

Cell pellets per 150-cm plate containing 1.0–2.0 × 107 cells were harvested when cell growth was approximately 90% confluent for G361 melanoma cell lines. Cells (7.5 × 106– 1.0 × 107), harvested from 100 ml C3ABR or L6, were washed twice in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, transferred to 1.5-ml Eppendorf microcentrifuge tubes, and washed a third time using an Eppendorf microcentrifuge (3000 rpm, 5 min). The supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellets were either used immediately or stored at −80 °C prior to use. Previously frozen cells were best for optimal ATM kinase activity, and pellets that had been stored for up to 6 months were usable in these assays. Cell extracts, ranging between 1.5 and 2.0 mg/ml Bradford (Bio-Rad), were generated as described (31Sarkaria J.N. Tibbetts R.S. Busby E.C. Kennedy A.P. Hill D.E. Abraham R.T.

Science. 1998; 281: 1674-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (1711) Google Scholar), was added to 1.5–2.0 mg of total lysate and rocked gently at 4 °C for 3 h. Sheep anti-mouse IgG complexed to magnetic beads (100 μl/sample) (Dynabeads, Dynal Corp.) was washed three times with Lysis buffer using a Magnetic Particle Concentrator (Dynal), reconstituted with 100 μl of Lysis buffer, added to the antibody/lysate mixture, and subsequently incubated, rocking gently, at 4 °C for 1.5 h. Following the 1.5-h immunoprecipitation period with the anti-mouse Ig-containing magnetic beads, the supernatant was discarded, and the beads were washed three times with Lysis buffer. A High Salt buffer was added to the metal beads followed by incubation on ice for 5 min to de-activate DNA-PK (31Sarkaria J.N. Tibbetts R.S. Busby E.C. Kennedy A.P. Hill D.E. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar). The High Salt buffer was removed, and the beads were washed once with Base buffer (10 mmMgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 100 mmHEPES, pH 7.5) and once with Kinase buffer containing both 10 mm Mg2+ and 10 mm Mn2+, 100 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 100 μm cold ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 50 nm microcystin (Alexis Corp.), 4 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride (Sigma) and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (NEN Life Science Products). (Initial experiments depicted in Fig. 1 A only were carried out with approximately 100 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP.) All reagents utilized for washes contained NaF and NaVO3 except for the Kinase buffer that contained microcystin. Samples were prepared and kept on ice prior to incubation at 30 °C. Reactions were carried out in a total volume of 30 μl of kinase buffer added to the magnetic beads. Where indicated, wortmannin was added, usually at 0.5 or 1 μm final concentration, to samples that had been washed three times in Lysis buffer and once in Base buffer and were brought up to volume (usually 50 μl) in Base buffer. The samples were allowed to react with wortmannin by incubation at room temperature for 20 min. This room temperature preincubation stage resulted in some net loss in overall ATM activity in the absence of wortmannin. Wortmannin inhibition persisted for at least 16–18 h without significant loss of inhibiting activity. 2G. Rathbun, unpublished observations. Phosphorylation assays were measured by removing 2–3.5 μl from kinase reactions at given time points and adding these aliquots to an equal volume of 30% acetic acid to stop the reaction. Aliquots (3.5–4.0 μl) of the halted reactions were then spotted on p81 phosphocellulose paper, allowed to dry, washed 3 times in 1% orthophosphoric acid (5–10 min/wash), and counted. Protein kinase activity of DNA-PK was assayed using purified DNA-PKcs, and Ku70 and Ku80 were prepared as described previously (40Chan D.W. Mody C.H. Ting N.S. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Briefly, the kinase reaction was carried out in the presence of DNA-PKcs (120 ng), Ku80/Ku70 (30 ng), and a final concentration of 100 μm ATP, 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, 10 mm MgCl2, or MnCl2, 200 ng of sonicated calf thymus DNA, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm EGTA, and 75 mm KCl in a 30-μl reaction volume. Samples were incubated at 30 °C, and aliquots were withdrawn, added to an equal volume of 30% glacial acetic acid, spotted on P81 paper, washed, and analyzed as described for ATM. In the absence of DNA, DNA-PKcs demonstrated residual activity, and isolated Ku70/Ku80 exhibited no kinase activity (data not shown). Peptide Library kinase assays by ATM and DNA-PK were independently evaluated at least twice, and generally, aspects of the assays were reproduced several times. Methods for preparing samples have been described extensively (41Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 87: 87-98PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 mg of peptide library was exposed to ATM phosphorylation activity in the presence of 0.33 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP and 300 μm cold ATP and calculated to phosphorylate approximately 1% of the peptides in the library (41Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 87: 87-98PubMed Google Scholar). The kinase reaction (300 μl) was terminated by adding an equal volume of 30% acetic acid and then desalted and purified over a 1-ml DEAE-Sephacel (Sigma) column to remove excess ATP. The void volume was usually discarded, and the samples, monitored through the presence of radioisotope, were lyophilized. Lyophilized samples were reconstituted in distilled, sterile H2O and applied to a ferric chelation nitrilotriacetic acid column as described (41Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 87: 87-98PubMed Google Scholar). Eluted samples were pooled and sequenced. Each cycle was normalized internally to all amino acids included at that position, and amino acid selectivity at a given cycle was assessed using a program developed specifically for that purpose. 3J. H. Lai and L. C. Cantley, unpublished observations. The SQ and SQII libraries were each analyzed in independent experiments at least twice. Immunoprecipitated ATM has been shown to express a Ser/Thr protein kinase activity that phosphorylates certain protein substrates (6Gately D.P. Hittle J.C. Chan G.K. Yen T.J. Mol. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar). To establish an initial priority for peptide substrate targets, we compared two degenerate peptide libraries as substrates for immunoprecipitated ATM protein kinase. These libraries contained four degenerate positions on both the N- and C-terminal sides of a fixed serine or threonine and were designated the Ser and Thr libraries, respectively. Our analysis showed that the Ser degenerate library was phosphorylated more than the Thr library (Fig.1 A). Due to the preferred Ser selection, we proceeded to screen additional second generation degenerate peptide libraries, several of which contained a second fixed residue at the +1-position (C-terminal to Ser). These analyses revealed a strong preference for the SQ library that exceeded a second tier of selected libraries severalfold (Fig.1 B). Libraries with hydrophobic amino acids at the +1-position (SI and SF) were somewhat preferred over the Ser library where the +1-position was degenerate. Arginine at position −3 (the RXXS library) was selected equivalently to the SI and SF libraries. Proline at the +1-position resulted in minimal phosphorylation (Fig. 1 B). ATM showed little or no phosphorylation of a library with a central, fixed tyrosine containing no Ser or Thr (Fig. 1 B). Strikingly, the 4Y4+ library, which does contain Ser and Thr in the degenerate positions, was selected equivalently to the SF library, consistent with a preference by ATM for hydrophobic aromatic residues at the +1-position or elsewhere within the sequence. We found that utilization of Mn2+ versus Mg2+ in the kinase reaction was essential for efficient phosphorylation of the SF, SI, and 4Y4+ libraries (data not shown). The SQ library was more highly phosphorylated in the presence of Mn2+, although significant phosphorylation still occurred in Mg2+. On the basis of the results in Fig.1 B, the SQ peptide library was selected for further analyses. The C3ABR and L6 EBV-transformed human B cell lines represent cells with wild-type ATM and mutant (null) ATM, respectively; the latter contains a stop codon at-position 35 in ATM (42Gilad S. Bar-Shira A. Harnik R. Shkedy D. Ziv Y. Khosravi R. Brown K. Vanagaite L. Xu G. Frydman M. Lavin M.F. Hill D. Tagle D.A. Shiloh Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1996; 5: 2033-2037Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As expected, the SQ library was highly phosphorylated in ATM immunoprecipitation assays of protein extracts derived from C3ABR, whereas immunoprecipitates from L6 demonstrated substantially less activity (Fig. 1 C). Previous studies have shown that ATM is highly sensitive to wortmannin, a fungal herbicide inhibitor (9Abraham R.T. Curr. Opin.

Sox2 and Oct-3 bind cooperatively to the enhancer DNA through their DNA-binding, high mobility group and POU domains, respectively. These two domains, however, are not sufficient to activate transcription. We have analyzed a number of Sox2 and Oct-3 deletion mutants to identify the domains within each protein that contribute to the activity of the Sox2·Oct-3 complex. Within Oct-3, we have identified two activation domains, the N-terminal AD1 and the C-terminal AD2, that play a role in the activity of the Sox2·Oct-3 complex. AD1 also displays transcriptional activation functions in the absence of Sox2 while AD2 function was only detected within the Sox2·Oct-3 complex. In Sox2, we have identified three activation domains within its C terminus: R1, R2, and R3. R1 and R2 can potentiate weak activation by Sox2 in the absence of Oct-3 but their deletion has no effect on the Sox2·Oct-3 complex. In contrast, R3 function is only observed when Sox2 is complexed with Oct-3. In addition, analysis of Oct-1/Oct-3 chimeras indicates that the Oct-3 homeodomain also plays a critical role in the formation of a functional Sox2·Oct-3 complex. Our results are consistent with a model in which the synergistic action of Sox2 and Oct-3 results from two major processes. Cooperative binding of the factors to the enhancer DNA, mediated by their binding domains, stably tethers each factor to DNA and increases the activity of intrinsic activation domains within each protein. Protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions then may lead to reciprocal conformational changes that expose latent activation domains within each protein.

It has become clear that resolution of this apparent paradox lies to a great extent in the observation that cells utilize a strategy of combinatorial and synergistic interactions among heterologous transcription factors to achieve specific and diverse patterns of gene expression. Thus, a true understanding of transcriptional regulation of developmentally regulated genes requires, rather than analyses of gene activation by individual transcription factors “in isolation,” the study of the mechanisms of activation by transcription factor complexes. Our studies have focused on defining the regulatory mechanisms that control transcription of the murineFGF-4 1 gene during embryogenesis. The FGF-4 gene encodes a signaling polypeptide that has been shown to play an essential role in embryonic development (1Basilico C. Moscatelli D. Adv.

In situ analyses have shown thatFGF-4 RNA is only detected in the inner cell mass of the blastocyst and subsequently at other embryonic locations, including the primitive streak, myotomes, and limb bud (2Goldfarb M.

FGF-4 gene expression in these distinct structures is governed by separate enhancer elements, the best characterized of which is that directingFGF-4 gene expression in the blastocyst and in EC cells (6Curatola A.M.

Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) that activity of this enhancer results from the assembly of a ternary complex, termed Oct-3*, composed of the embryonic transcription factors Oct-3 (also called Oct-4) (10Scholer H.R. Ruppert S. Suzuki N. Chowdhury K. Gruss P. Nature. 1990; 344: 435-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar) and Sox 2 (11Gubbay J. Collignon J. Koopman P. Capel B. Economou A. Munsterberg A.

Enhancer activation requires that both Oct-3 and Sox2 bind their adjacent sites on the enhancer since expression of either protein in the absence of the other is not sufficient to confer transcriptional activation. Other octamer-binding proteins (Oct-1 (9Yuan H. Corbi N. Basilico C. Dailey L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) or Oct-6) 2L. Dailey and C. Basilico, unpublished observations. cannot substitute for Oct-3 nor can Sox5 functionally replace Sox2 in the Sox2·Oct-3 complex (9Yuan H. Corbi N. Basilico C. Dailey L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Together these results predicted that the FGF-4enhancer should only be activated in cells that express both Sox2 and Oct-3, a notion that was supported by additional evidence in vivo (7Fraidenrich D. Lang R. Basilico C. Dev. Biol. 1998; 204: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 13Nichols J. Zevnik B. Anastassiatis K. Niwa H. Klewe-Nebenius D. Chambers I. Scholer H. Smith A. Cell. 1998; 95: 379-391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2703) Google Scholar). Our previous studies demonstrated that assembly of an active Oct-3* complex requires a specific arrangement of binding sites for Sox2 and Oct-3 on the enhancer DNA since insertion of as few as 3 additional base pairs between the normally juxtaposed binding sites severely impairs enhancer function (14Ambrosetti D.C. Basilico C. Dailey L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). We proposed that this specific arrangement of factor binding sites facilitates protein-protein interactions between the DNA-binding POU and HMG domains of Oct-3 and Sox2, respectively, thus leading to the observed cooperative binding on the enhancer DNA (14Ambrosetti D.C. Basilico C. Dailey L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). While these interactions are essential to proper Oct-3* complex assembly, this parameter alone could not account for the specificity of the requirement for Oct-3 in partnership with Sox2 since the POU domain of Oct-1 can also participate in direct protein-protein interaction with Sox2 (14Ambrosetti D.C. Basilico C. Dailey L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). To further define the molecular basis of synergistic transcriptional activation by the Oct-3* complex, we have analyzed a number of Sox2 and Oct-3 deletion mutants to identify domains within each protein that contribute to Oct-3* activity. In addition, we have studied a series of Oct-3/Oct-1 chimeric proteins to gain insight into the molecular distinction between these related transcription factors that allows Oct-3, but not Oct-1, to form a transcriptionally active ternary complex with Sox2. Our results show that multiple regions within both Sox2 and Oct-3 can contribute to transcriptional activation by the Oct-3* complex. Some of these domains participate in transcriptional activation by each of these proteins in the absence of the partner factor and thus are intrinsic activation domains. The function of other domains within Sox2 and Oct-3 is only observed in the context of the ternary complex. However, analysis of Oct-1/Oct-3 chimeras suggest that the Oct-3 homeodomain also plays a critical role in assembly of an active Oct-3* complex. Our results indicate that the synergistic action of Oct-3 and Sox2 results from two concerted steps. The first relies on cooperative binding of these factors to the enhancer DNA which is mediated by the POU domain of Oct-3 and the HMG domain of Sox2. These protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions may then lead to reciprocal conformation changes within each protein that cause the exposure of latent activation domains and activation of gene expression. As a number of complexes composed of specific POU and HMG domain partners have been described (15Zwilling S. Konig H. Wirth T.

HeLa cell transfections and CAT assays were as described previously (14Ambrosetti D.C. Basilico C. Dailey L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). The CMV-βGal plasmid was utilized for normalization. The −64fgf CAT reporter plasmid was constructed by PCR amplification of the murinefgf-4 promoter region between positions −64 and +101 using the forward primer 5′-CCCGGGGCAGGCGGCCTGCGCCCC-3′ (containing a recognition site for SmaI) and the reverse primer 5′-AGATCTTGCGTGAGTTCGAGCTGC-3′ (containing a recognition site for BglII). After SmaI/BglII digestion, one copy of the 200-bp PCR product was inserted between the SmaI and BglII sites, upstream of the CAT gene within the pCAT3-Basic Vector (Promega). To obtain the 6×S/O-CAT reporter construct, six copies of annealed oligonucleotides containing the fgf-4 enhancer sequence shown in Fig. 1 A were first cloned in tandem into the BamHI site of Bluescript KS plasmid. This plasmid was digested with SacI and SmaI and the multimerized element was cloned upstream of the FGF-4 promoter in −64fgf-CAT. To obtain the 6×(lex) CAT reporter plasmid, six tandem copies of the lexA operator sequence shown in Fig. 6 A were cloned into the BamHI site of Bluescript KS. Multimerized binding sites were excise from the plasmid by SacI and SmaI digestion and cloned in −64fgf-CAT. C- and N-terminal deletions of the Sox2 coding sequence were generated by PCR using pCEP-Sox2 (9Yuan H. Corbi N. Basilico C. Dailey L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar) as a template. To obtain C-terminal deletion mutants, forward primer 5′-GGTGGGAGGTCTATATAAG-3′ was used in combination with deletion-specific reverse primers that each contained the last 6 codons of the corresponding Sox2 sequence followed by a stop codon and a BamHI recognition site. To obtain deletion mutants Sox2 31–129 (HMG) and Sox2 31–319, forward primer 5′-GCGGCCGCATGGCGACCGGCGGCAACCAG-3′, containing a NotI recognition site and the ATG start codon, was combined with reverse primers 5′-GGATCCTCAAAGCTGGTACTTATCCTT-3′ or 5′-GGATCCTCACATGTGCGACAGGGG-3′, respectively. All PCR products were digested with NotI and BamHI and cloned in the pCEP4 expression vector (Invitrogen). To generate the Oct-3 deletion mutants, DNA fragments were generated by PCR using the wild type pCMVOct-4 plasmid (21Brehm A. Ohbo K. Scholer H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) as template and oligonucleotide primers complementary to Oct-3 sequences upstream or downstream of the POU domain. The 5′ oligonucleotide primers contained either aBamHI or BglII restriction site while the 3′ oligonucleotide primers contained a stop codon followed by anXbaI restriction site. PCR products were enzymatically digested and cloned between the BamHI and XbaI sites of the pEVRF2 expression plasmid (20Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schreiber E. Rusconi S. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6481Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 21Brehm A. Ohbo K. Scholer H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Cloning in this manner produces a fusion protein containing an N-terminal stretch of six amino acids derived from the Herpes simplex virus TK gene. The inclusion of this leader sequence was employed to minimize differences in expression levels or stability of Oct-3 variants lacking the natural Oct-3 N terminus. Primer combinations (see primer sequences below) used to generate the following mutants were: pCMVOct-3 (aa 1–352 numbering according to Ref. 22Rosner M.H. Vigano M.A. Ozato K. Rimmons P.M. Poirier F. Rigby P.W. Staudt L.M. Nature. 1990; 345: 686-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar), primers 1 and 2); ΔN (aa 117–352), primers 2 and 4; and ΔC (aa 1–286), primers 2 and 3. The Oct-3/Oct-1 chimera plasmids 0.1.0 and 0.3.0, encoding only the POU domains of Oct-1 or Oct-3, respectively, were generated by PCR using plasmids pCGOct-1 or pCMVOct-4, respectively, as templates. The 5′ oligonucleotide primers contained restriction sites for both BamHI and KpnI while the 3′ oligonucleotide primers contained sites for both SalI and XbaI. 0.1.0 encodes for Oct-1 amino acids −278 to −436 (numbering according to Ref. 23Sturm R.A. Das G. Herr W. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1582-1599Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar) and was generated using primers 5 and 6; 0.3.0 encodes for Oct-3 amino acids −126 to −282 and was generated using primers 7 and 8. The PCR products were digested with BamHI and XbaI and inserted between the BamHI and XbaI sites of the pEVRF2 plasmid. Thus for both 0.10 and 0.30 the insert contains 5′ to 3′, BamHI KpnI, POU, SalI, and XbaI. The 3.1.3 Oct-1/Oct-3 chimera was constructed in a stepwise manner. The chimera pcmv-POU2–4C described by Brehm et al. (21Brehm A. Ohbo K. Scholer H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 154-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) contains the POU domain of Oct-2 fused to the C terminus (amino acids 283–352) of Oct-4 (Oct-3). After BamHI and SalI digestion of pcmv-POU-2–4C, the POU-2 segment of this plasmid was replaced with the BamHI/SalI-digested POU-1 fragment of 0.1.0 to create 0.1.3 (POU-1 plus the Oct-3 C terminus). Digestion of 0.l.3 with KpnI and XbaI was followed by ligation of the purified POU-1-Oct-3 C-terminal fragment into the KpnI and XbaI sites of the Brehm plasmid pcmv-4N-POU-2, to create 3.1.3. The “wild type” control plasmid 3.3.3 was created by replacement of the POU-1 segment of 3.1.3 by that of POU-3 after digestion of 0.3.0 with KpnI and SalI and ligation of the purified POU-3 sequence intoKpnI- and SalI-digested 3.1.3.Figure 6A, schematic representation of the 6×(Lex)-CAT reporter construct. 6 copies of a 39-bp DNA fragment containing the recognition sequence for lexA factors, were cloned in tandem upstream of the murine FGF-4 promoter region.B, Oct-3 AD1 domain and Sox2 R1 and R3 domains are modular independent activation domains. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with 2 μg of the 6×(Lex)-CAT reporter construct shown in A and different amount of CMV-driven expression constructs for the lexA DNA-binding domain or lexA fusion proteins containing Sox2 or Oct-3 functional domains. For each lex/Sox and lex/Oct fusion protein schematically represented on the left side of the histogram, three different amount of expression construct were used: 0.5 μg (white bar), 1 μg (gray bars), 2.5 μg (black bars). CAT activity was expressed as fold induction of expression construct for lexA DNA-binding domain only. Each bar represents the mean of a duplicate from one representative experiment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Chimeras between the Oct-1 and Oct-3 POU domains were originally created by Y. Luo of the Rockefeller University and cloned into the pGEX2T bacterial expression vector. POU B contains the POUSand linker segments of Oct-1 (Oct-1 amino acids 278–378) fused to the POUHD of Oct-3 (Oct-3 amino acids 223–282). POU D contains the POUS and linker segments of Oct-3 (amino acids 127–222) fused to the POUHD of Oct-1 (Oct-1 amino acids 379–436). These chimeric sequences were used as templates for PCRs with oligonucleotide primers 5 and 8 (for POU B) or primers 7 and 6 (POU D). The PCR products were digested with KpnI and SalI and inserted at the KpnI and SalI sites of 3.3.3 to replace the wild type Oct-3 POU domain with chimeric POU B or POU D. Thr primers used were pr1, GGGGAGATCTTCCATGGCTGGACACCTGGC; pr2, GGGGGGGATCCGTGAAGTTGGAGAAGGTG; pr3, CCCCTCTAGATCAGGAATACTCCAATACTTG; pr4, CCCCTCTAGATCAGTTTGAATGCATGGG; pr5, CCCCGGATCCGGTACCAGCTTGGAGGAGCCCAGTG; and pr6, CCCCTCTAGAGGTCGACTCTTTTTTCTTTCTGGCGGCG. To construct the lexA DNA-binding domain expression vector, the HindIII/SphI (blunted) DNA fragment encoding lexA amino acid residues 1–202 followed by one in-frame HA epitope, was isolated from the pEG202-(+HA) plasmid (24Saluja D. Vassallo M. Tanese N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5734-5743Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and cloned in the HindIII and BamHI (blunted) sites of pCEP4 expression vector. The resulting plasmid was used as a template for PCR with forward primer 5′-GGTCTATATAAGCAGAGC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GGATCCTCAAGCGGCCGCCGGGGCCTCCATGGCGTATAC-3′ which contains aNotI recognition site follow by a stop codon and aBamHI recognition site. The resulting PCR product was then digested at the HindIII and BamHI sites and cloned into the pCEP4 vector to obtain the pCEP-lex202 expression construct. To obtain lexA/Sox2 and lexA/Oct-3 fusion protein expression vectors, DNA fragments expressing Sox2 or Oct-3 subregions were amplified by PCR using a forward (F) primer containing aNotI recognition site and a reverse (R) primer containing a stop codon followed by a BamHI recognition site. AfterNotI and BamHI digestion, each coding sequence was cloned in-frame with the lexA DNA-binding domain within pCEP-lex202. Forward and reverse oligonucleotide sequences for each fusion protein were as follows: lex/Oct (1–53), (F)ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTATGGCTGGACACCTGGCTTC and (R)CGCGGATCCTCACAATACCTCTGAGCCTGG; lex/Oct (257–352), (F)ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTGCCAATCAGCTTGGGCTAG and (R)CGCGGATCCTCAGTTTGAATGCATGGGAGC; lex/Sox (121–189), (F)ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTCTCATGAAGAAGGATAAG and (R)CGCGGATCCTCAAGCGTTGAGGCCCGGGTG; lex/Sox (250–319), (F)ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTAGCTCCAGCCCCCCCGTG and (R)CGCGGATCCTCACATGTGCGACAGGGG. Bacterially expressed, glutathione S-transferase-purified proteins and in vitro transcribed and translated products were prepared as described previously (14Ambrosetti D.C. Basilico C. Dailey L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were prepared from transfected HeLa cells by three freeze/thaw cycles in BC400N (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 400 mm KCl, 1.0 mm EDTA, 0.02% Nonidet P-40). The protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein reagent and adjusted to 2 μg/μl with BC400N. Relative expression levels of the Oct-3 and Sox2 mutants were determined using EMSA as described (8Dailey L. Yuan H. Basilico C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7758-7769Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Because of significant differences in the expression of the Oct-3 mutants, both the CAT activity (i.e. fold induction) and DNA binding activity (i.e. % of FGF enhancer DNA probe specifically bound) were determined across a broad range (0.01–1 μg) of transfected plasmid DNA. Relative CAT activities were then normalized to the DNA binding activity (i.e. expression level) for each mutant. All quantitation was accomplished using a PhosphorImager (ImageQuant). The fold induction of 6×(S/O)CAT reporter gene transcription represents the level of CAT activity observed in the presence of co-transfected Oct- or Sox2 expression plasmid divided by the level of CAT activity observed in the absence of Sox2 or Oct-3 expression (i.e. the basal level). Fold synergy is the value obtained by division of the fold induction of CAT gene expression observed for a Sox·Oct complex by the sum of the fold induction potentiated by Sox2 and Oct-3 proteins individually. (Fold synergy = fold induction Oct3*/[fold induction Sox2] + [fold induction Oct-3].) As detailed in Ref. 14Ambrosetti D.C. Basilico C. Dailey L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, the degree of cooperative binding is measured as the percentage of probe bound within the ternary complex divided by the multiple of the percentage of probe bound by Sox2 and octamer-binding protein individually. A result greater than 1 indicates that the ternary complex was formed by cooperative interactions among its individual components. To gain an understanding of why the Oct-3* complex composed of both Sox2 and Oct-3, but neither protein alone, can effectively activate the FGF-4 enhancer, we have analyzed Sox2 and Oct-3 deletion mutants and chimeric proteins to identify and compare the roles of domains required for independent transcriptional activation by each of these proteins with those required for function of the Oct-3* complex. The CAT reporter plasmid 6×(S/O)-CAT used in these and all subsequent experiments contains 6 copies of the murineFGF-4 enhancer octamer and Sox DNA-binding elements placed upstream of a minimal murine FGF-4 promoter (Fig.1 A). As expected, the presence of the octamer and Sox-binding elements in this plasmid led to transcription of the CAT reporter gene in undifferentiated F9 cells but not in HeLa cells, since HeLa cells lack both Oct-3 and Sox2 (data not shown). Consistent with our previous results using similar reporters, the 6×(S/O)-CAT construct could only be effectively activated in HeLa cells when co-transfected with expression plasmids for both Sox2 and Oct-3 (9Yuan H. Corbi N. Basilico C. Dailey L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). As shown below, the 6×(S/O)-CAT plasmid was exquisitely sensitive to transactivation by Sox2 and Oct-3 expression, allowing the detection of weak transactivating activities that were not detectable with the previously used reporter plasmids (9Yuan H. Corbi N. Basilico C. Dailey L. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2635-2645Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar,14Ambrosetti D.C. Basilico C. Dailey L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Activation of the FGF-4 enhancer by Sox2 and Oct-3 over a broad range of plasmid concentrations occurred in a synergistic manner, the level of transcriptional activation achieved by the Oct-3* complex being much greater than the sum of activation by the individual Oct-3 and Sox2 proteins (Fig. 1 B). Relatively little activation of CAT gene expression was observed when Sox2 and Oct-3 were independently expressed, and then only at very high concentration of factor expressing vectors. Given our previous demonstration of a direct protein-protein interaction and cooperative DNA binding by the HMG and POU domains (14Ambrosetti D.C. Basilico C. Dailey L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6321-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), we tested whether either of these domains is sufficient to confer synergistic activation of the 6×(S/O)-CAT plasmid when complexed with its factor partner (Oct-3 or Sox2, respectively). Activation of CAT gene expression was assessed after co-transfection of the reporter plasmid into HeLa cells with expression plasmids for the POU domain of Oct-3 (Fig. 2,POU3), or full-length Oct-3 protein (Fig. 2,Oct-3), alone or in combination with expression plasmids for Sox2 (Fig. 2, Sox2) or the Sox2 HMG domain (Fig. 2,HMG). Within the range of expression plasmid DNA used in this experiment, transfection of these constructs individually resulted in either marginal or no CAT gene activation. In contrast, coexpression of full-length Sox2 and Oct-3 proteins resulted in a 160-fold activation of CAT gene transcription (Fig.2 B) and displayed about 20-fold synergism (Fig.2 C). Coexpression of the Sox2 HMG domain with full-length Oct-3 resulted in a lower but substantial level of transcription activation of the CAT reporter gene compared with that observed using the wild-type proteins (77-fold activation, Fig.2 B). The degree of synergism observed using the Sox2 HMG domain and Oct-3 was still considerable (16-fold). Similarly, coexpression of POU3 with wild type Sox2 resulted in a markedly lower level of overall reporter gene activation (28-fold activation) but still displayed a significant degree of synergy. These results are consistent with the notion that the DNA-binding HMG and POU domains play a major role in mediating synergy between the Oct-3 and Sox2 proteins. However, coexpression of just the POU3 and the HMG domain expression plasmids did not result in activation of the CATreporter gene (Fig. 2), demonstrating that the HMG and POU domains must act in conjunction with additional domains within Oct-3 and Sox2 to promote transcriptional activation. The results of the previous section suggested that a component of Oct-3* complex activity must reside outside of the Oct-3 POU and Sox2 HMG domains. To identify these domains within Oct-3, and to understand whether they were uniquely required for function of the Oct-3* complex, deletion mutants of the Oct-3 proteins were created by PCR and their activity tested on the 6×(S/O)-CAT reporter plasmid in HeLa cells. Fig. 3 shows a schematic representation of the 352-amino acid Oct-3 protein and the Oct-3 deletion mutants used in this study (numbering according to Ref. 22Rosner M.H. Vigano M.A. Ozato K. Rimmons P.M. Poirier F. Rigby P.W. Staudt L.M. Nature. 1990; 345: 686-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (771) Google Scholar). EMSA (Fig.3 D) and Western blot analysis (not shown) indicated a significant variation in the expression levels of the various mutant proteins. Thus we normalized all values of CAT activity to DNA binding (i.e. expression level) for each mutant, as detailed under “Experimental Procedures.” We first tested the ability of the Oct-3 deletion mutants to promote gene expression of the CAT reporter plasmid in the absence of Sox2. At the concentration of expression plasmid used in these experiments, Oct-3 produced an average 28-fold stimulation of CAT gene expression (Fig. 3 B). Deletion of the majority of the N-terminal amino acids rendered the resulting ΔN mutant incapable of efficiently activating transcription (Fig.3 B). Only 1.5–3.5-fold activation by ΔN could be observed across a broad range of transfected expression plasmid (0.1–3 μg, data not shown). This r"

In the central nervous system presynaptic α2AR act to inhibit the release of neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine. As such, a number of responses have been ascribed to activation of these receptors by endogenous catecholamines or exogenously administered agonists. These include modulation of blood pressure, sedation, analgesia, opiate withdrawal, and multiple complex cognitive and behavioral parameters (1Ruffolo Jr., R.R. Nichols A.J. Stadel J.M. Hieble J.P.

The therapeutic utility of α2AR agonists and antagonists has been limited by the lack of highly subtype-specific compounds as well as marked interindividual variability in efficacy and adverse side effects of available agents. Given the above, and our recent delineation of functionally significant polymorphisms of the β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors (12Green S.A. Cole G. Jacinto M. Innis M. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 23116-23121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Green S. Turki J. Innis M. Liggett S.B.

Chem. 1999; 274: 12670-12674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar), we have examined the genomic cDNA sequence of the α2CAR in a cohort of normal individuals. A four-amino acid deletion in the third intracellular loop was found, which was much more common in African-Americans as compared with Caucasians. Recombinant studies revealed that the deletion receptor has a distinct phenotype with a significant loss of signaling to several effector systems. The sequence encoding the third intracellular loop of the human α2C receptor (GenBankTM assession no. J03853) was examined for polymorphic variation by performing polymerase chain reactions (PCR) to amplify this portion of the cDNA from genomic DNA derived from blood samples. In this paper the adenine of the initiator ATG codon is designated as nucleotide 1 and amino acid 1 is the encoded methionine. The human receptor consists of 462 amino acids. For initial examination, DNA from 20 normal individuals was utilized. Primers for PCR were: 5′-CCACCATCGTCGCCGTGTGGCTCATCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-AGGCCTCGCGGCAGATGCCGTACA-3′ (antisense). The PCR consisted of ∼100 ng of genomic DNA, 5 pmol of each M13 primer, 0.8 mm dNTPs, 10% Me2SO, 2.5 units Platinum taq DNA polymerase High Fidelity (Life Technologies, Inc.), 20 μl of 5× buffer E (Invitrogen) in a 100-μl reaction volume. Reactions were started by an initial incubation at 94 °C for four minutes, followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 65 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for seven minutes. Attempts to directly sequence this product resulted in ambiguous reads, so the product was ligated into the vector PCR2.1-TOPO (Invitrogen) and TOP 10 cells were transformed. Multiple colonies from each transformation were expanded, and the subsequently isolated DNA was sequenced using an ABI 373A automated sequencer in the forward and reverse directions using dye terminator chemistry with vector T7 and M13 primers. As is discussed below, a 12-bp deletion was found in some individuals beginning at nucleotide 964 (Fig. 1 A). This results in the loss of amino acids 322–325 and thus this polymorphic receptor is denoted Del322–325. This deletion results in the loss of aNciI restriction site at nucleotide 974 (forward strand), and thus a rapid detection method was devised. Smaller (384 and 372 base pair) PCR products were produced using 5′-AGCCCGACGAGAGCAGCGCA-3′ as the sense primer and the aforementioned antisense primer (same reaction conditions as above), and genomic DNA derived from blood samples as the template. Within this fragment there are either five or six NciI restriction sites depending on the presence or absence of the deletion, providing for the pattern shown in Fig.1 C. This rapid detection technique was applied to additional DNA samples providing genotypes at this locus from a total of 146 individuals. To create the polymorphic α2CAR construct the larger (723 bp) PCR product described above amplified from a homozygous individual was digested and subcloned into the Bpu1102 I and Eco47 III sites of the wild-type α2CAR sequence in the expression vector pBC12BI (15Eason M.G. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25473-25479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The integrity of the construct was verified by sequencing. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-K1) were permanently transfected by a calcium phosphate precipitation technique as described previously using 30 μg of each receptor construct and 0.5 μg of pSV2neo to provide for G418 resistance (15Eason M.G. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25473-25479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Selection of positive clones was carried out in 1.0 mg/ml G418, and expression of the α2Creceptors from individual clonal lines was determined by radioligand binding as described below. Cells were grown in monolayers in Ham's F-12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 80 μg/ml G418 (to maintain selection pressure) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2atmosphere. α2AR inhibition of adenylyl cyclase was determined in membrane preparation from CHO cells stably expressing the two receptors using methods similar to those previously described (15Eason M.G. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25473-25479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, membranes (∼20 μg) were incubated with 27 μm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.6 μm GTP, 0.1 mm cAMP, 0.12 mm ATP, 50 μg/ml myokinase, 0.05 mm ascorbic acid, and 2 μCi of [α-32P]ATP in a buffer containing 40 mmHEPES, pH 7.4, 1.6 mm MgCl2, and 0.8 mm EDTA for 30 min at 37 °C. These conditions minimize the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, which is observed at high agonist concentrations (16Fraser C.M. Arakawa S. McCombie W.R. Venter J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11754-11761Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Eason M.G. Kurose H. Holt B.D. Raymond J.R. Liggett S.B. J. Biol.

Labeled cAMP was isolated by gravity chromatography over alumina columns with [3H]cAMP used to quantitate column recovery. Activities were measured in the presence of water (basal), 5 μm forskolin, and 5 μmforskolin with the indicated concentrations of agonists. Results are expressed as percent inhibition of forskolin-stimulated activity. Activation of p44/42 MAP kinase was determined by quantitative immunoblotting using a phosphospecific antibody. Briefly, confluent cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in serum-free media prior to treatment with media alone (basal), epinephrine (10 μm), or thrombin (1 unit/ml) for 5 min. Cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline and then lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 5 mm NaF) containing protease inhibitors (10 μg/ml benzamidine, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin). Western blots of these whole cell lysates were performed essentially as described previously (18Jewell-Motz E.A. Donnelly E.T. Eason M.G. Liggett S.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 15720-15725Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) except that polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were used and incubated with phospho-p44/42 MAP kinase E10 antibody and (after stripping) with the p44/42 MAP kinase monoclonal antibody (both from New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) at dilutions of 1:2000 for 1 h at room temperature. Washed membranes were subsequently incubated with anti-mouse fluorescein-linked immunoglobulin followed by incubation with fluorescein alkaline phosphatase (ECF, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Fluorescent signals were quantitated by real time acquisition using a Molecular Dynamics STORM imager. Total inositol phosphate levels in intact cells were determined essentially as described previously (19Schwinn D.A. Page S.O. Middleton J.P. Lorenz W. Liggett S.B. Yamamoto K. Caron M.G.

Subsequently, cells were washed and incubated with phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min followed by a 30-min incubation with 20 mm LiCl in phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were then treated with phosphate-buffered saline alone (basal), 10 μm epinephrine, or 5 units/ml thrombin for 5 min, and inositol phosphates were extracted as described by Martin (20Martin T.F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 14816-14822Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Following separation on Agl-X8 columns, total inositol phosphates were eluted with a solution containing 0.1 m formic acid and 1m formate. Expression of mutant and wild-type α2CAR was determined using saturation binding assays as described (21Eason M.G. Jacinto M.T. Theiss C.T. Liggett S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11178-11182Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) with 12 concentrations (0.5–30 nm) of [3H]yohimbine and 10 μm phentolamine used to define nonspecific binding. For competition studies, membranes were incubated in 50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.4, 10 mmMgSO4, 0.5 mm EDTA with 2.0 nm[3H]yohimbine and 16 concentrations of the indicated competitor in the presence of 100 μm GppNHp for 30 min at 37 °C. Reactions for the above radioligand binding studies were terminated by dilution with 4 volumes of ice cold 10 mmTris-HCL, pH 7.4, buffer and vacuum filtration over Whatmann GF/C glass fiber filters. Protein determinations were by the copper bicinchoninic acid method (22Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18349) Google Scholar). Data from adenylyl cyclase and radioligand binding assays were analyzed by iterative least-square techniques using Prizm software (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). Agreement between genotypes was observed, and those predicted by the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were assessed by a χ2 test with one degree of freedom. Comparisons of results from biochemical studies were paired by t tests, and significance was considered when p < 0.05. Data are provided as means ± standard errors. From the initial sequencing of α2CAR third intracellular loop PCR products from 40 chromosomes, one nonsynonymous sequence variant was identified (Fig. 1). This consisted of an in-frame 12-nucleotide (GGGGCGGGGCCG, sense strand) deletion beginning at nucleotide 964. This results in a loss of Gly-Ala-Gly-Pro at amino acid positions 322–325 within the third intracellular loop of the receptor (Fig.2). Other than this deletion, the remaining encoded sequence was identical to that shown in Fig. 2. The frequencies of the wild-type and the Del322–325 polymorphic α2CARs are shown in TableI. The polymorphism is rare in Caucasians with an allele frequency of 0.040. In contrast, the frequency is ∼10-fold higher (0.381) in African-Americans. The distribution of homozygous and heterozygous alleles was not different than that predicted from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p > 0.8). No other nonsynonymous polymorphisms were found in the third loop sequence. However, five synonymous single nucleotide variations were found at nucleic acids 868, 871, 933, 996, and 1167.Table IFrequencies of the Del322–325 α2CAR polymorphismnWT homozygousHeterozygousDel322–325 homozygousAllele frequency Del322–325Caucasian8782320.040African-American59232790.381Shown are the number of individuals with each genotype out of a total of n individuals. Open table in a new tab Shown are the number of individuals with each genotype out of a total of n individuals. The consequences of this polymorphism on receptor function were evaluated by permanently expressing the human wild-type α2CAR and the Del322–325 receptor in CHO cells and examining multiple signaling pathways. As indicated, multiple clones with similar expression levels were utilized for these studies. Saturation radioligand binding studies using the α2AR antagonist [3H]yohimbine revealed that Del322–325 had a slightly, but statistically significant, lower affinity for the radioligand compared with wild-type α2CAR (Kd = 3.8 ± 0.55 versus 2.0 ± 0.14 nm, n = 5, p = 0.03, Table II). In competition studies with the antagonist phentolamine, however, no differences in the Ki values were found between the Del322–325 polymorphism and the wild-type α2CAR (11.1 ± 1.8versus 10.4 ± 1.2 nm, n = 5). In competition studies with the agonist epinephrine, carried out in the absence of GTP, high and low affinity binding was detected with both receptors. However, the high affinity dissociation constant,KH, of the Del322–325 mutant was greater (i.e. lower affinity) compared with the wild-type receptor (7.3 ± 0.95 versus 3.7 ± 0.43 nm,n = 4, p = 0.01). The percentage of receptors in the high affinity state was less with the mutant receptor (%RH = 31 ± 4 versus49 ± 4, p = 0.01). The KLvalues were not different (584 ± 71 versus 416 ± 75 nm). Taken together, this suggested that functional coupling might be depressed with the Del322–325 receptor because of impaired formation of the high affinity agonist-receptor-Gi/Go complex.Table IILigand binding properties and adenylyl cyclase activities of the wild-type and Del322–325 α2CAR expressed in CHO cellsReceptorRadioligand bindingAdenylyl cyclase activityPhentolamineKiEpinephrine[3H]YohimbineKHKLRHKDBmaxMax inhibitionEC50nmnmnm%nmfmol/mg%nmWTα2C11.1 ± 1.83.7 ± 0.43416 ± 7549 ± 42.0 ± 0.141375 ± 14160 ± 32.6 ± 0.74565 ± 6973 ± 24.32-aEC50 data were derived from composite curve analysis.

Adenylyl cyclase activities were determined in the presence of 5.0 μm forskolin and increasing concentration of epinephrine. Indeed, the location of the deletion in the third intracellular loop of the receptor is within 15 residues of the sequence RRGGRR. This is a motif (BBXB or BBXXB) that has been identified in a number of receptors as a Gi coupling domain (23Okamoto T. Nishimoto I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8342-8346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Ikezu T. Okamoto T. Ogata E. Nishimoto I. FEBS Lett. 1992; 311: 29-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). We considered that the deletion of the two glycines or the proline in the Del322–325 receptor may induce conformational changes affecting this region or other G protein coupling domains. Functional studies examining agonist-promoted inhibition of forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activities were carried out in lines with the wild-type α2CAR and the Del322–325 receptor at expression levels of 1375 ± 141 versus 1081 ± 157 fmol/mg (n = 5, p > 0.05) and a second set of lines with lower expressions of 565 ± 69 versus519 ± 51 fmol/mg (n = 5, p > 0.05), respectively. The results of these studies are shown in Table IIand Fig. 3. As can be seen, there is a marked functional difference between the two receptors. In the higher expressing lines (Fig. 3 A), wild-type α2CAR exhibited a maximal inhibitory response of 60 ± 3%. In contrast, the Del322–325 polymorphic receptor achieved a maximal inhibition of 31 ± 2% (n = 5, p < 0.001), which represents an ∼50% impairment of function. Of note, the EC50 values for these responses (2.6 ± 0.74versus 1.2 ± 0.37 nm, respectively) were not different. Results from studies with the lower expressing lines revealed an even more striking phenotypic difference between the two receptors. As is shown in Fig. 3 B, at these more physiologic levels of expression, agonist-promoted inhibition of adenylyl cyclase with wild-type α2CAR was 73 ± 2.4%. In marked contrast, the Del322–325 receptor exhibited very little inhibition (10 ± 4.3%, n = 5, p < 0.001). With the low expressing Del322–325 line, the EC50 in some experiments could not be calculated because of the minimal response. Analysis of the composite curve of the mean data from all experiments with this line revealed an EC50 of 29.6 nm. This is in contrast to 4.3 nm calculated in a like manner for the low expressing wild-type line. A similar degree of impairment was also observed with the endogenous agonist norepinephrine (TableIII). Agonist-promoted functional activities of the two higher expressing receptors were also explored with full and partial synthetic α2AR agonists with diverse structures. (Because some of these agents were weak partial agonists, only the high expressing lines could be used.) As is shown in Table III, the Del322–325 receptor has depressed agonist-promoted coupling to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase with all the agonists tested. Similar to the responses observed with epinephrine and norepinephrine, the Del322–325 receptor showed ∼50% impairment in the maximal inhibition of adenylyl cyclase compared with the wild-type α2CAR for UK14304 (full agonist) as well as BHT-933, guanabenz, clonidine, and oxymetazoline (partial agonists), with no significant differences observed in the EC50 values for these responses.Table IIIAdenylyl cyclase activities of the wild-type and Del322–325 α2CAR for full and partial agonistsAgonistMax inhibition3-ap < 0.05 compared to the wild-type α2CAR (n = three or four experiments).EC50WTα2CARDel322–325WTα2CARDel322–325%nmNorepinephrine76.6 ± 1.6034.9 ± 0.887219 ± 13.7224 ± 70.7UK 1430467.6 ± 2.0930.8 ± 4.68131 ± 31.0109 ± 24.1BHT-93356.8 ± 1.4126.7 ± 2.405500 ± 21104080 ± 2005Guanabenz53.8 ± 1.9930.0 ± 1.9810.0 ± 1.067.89 ± 3.43Clonidine38.5 ± 2.4420.9 ± 1.28262 ± 26.1178 ± 43.8Oxymetazoline27.0 ± 2.7012.8 ± 1.4032.2 ± 1.6629.1 ± 0.565Adenylyl cyclase assays were performed on membranes prepared from CHO cell lines expressing wild-type and Del322–325 α2CAR at 1570 ± 79.9 and 1520 ± 27.6 fmol/mg, respectively, as described under “Materials and Methods.”3-a p < 0.05 compared to the wild-type α2CAR (n = three or four experiments).

In CHO cells this response is ablated by pertussis toxin, indicating coupling via Gi and/or Go (25Dorn G.W. Oswald K.J. McCluskey T.S. Kuhel D.G. Liggett S.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6415-6423Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The activation of phopholipase C is likely because of both Go- and Gi-associated Gβγ stimulation of the enzyme (25Dorn G.W. Oswald K.J. McCluskey T.S. Kuhel D.G. Liggett S.B. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6415-6423Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4, the loss of function phenotype of the Del322–325 receptor as delineated in adenylyl cyclase experiments was also observed in these inositol phosphate accumulation studies. Epinephrine-stimulated accumulation of inositol phosphates was 30 ± 3% over basal with the wild-type α2CAR, compared with 11 ± 2% for the Del322–325 receptor (n = 4, p < 0.005), which amounts to an ∼60% impairment of function for the polymorphic receptor. Expression levels for the two receptors for these experiments were 806 ± 140 and 733 ± 113, respectively. Finally, agonist-mediated stimulation of MAP kinase was examined. The mechanism of G protein-coupled receptor-mediated stimulation of this pathway is multifactorial and appears to be both receptor and cell-type dependent (26Luttrell L.M. van Biesen T. Hawes B.E. Koch W.J. Krueger K.M. Touhara K. Lefkowitz R.J. Adv. Second Messenger Phosphoprotein Res. 1997; 31: 263-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). For the β2AR, coupling to Gi, internalization of the receptor and interaction with β-arrestin is required for this receptor to activate the MAP kinase cascade (27Pierce K. Maudsley S. Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 97: 1489-1494Crossref Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Less is known about α2AR coupling to this pathway; however, it is clear that it is pertussis toxin-sensitive and that receptor internalization is not necessary (28Schramm N.L. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24935-24940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). For the current studies, MAP kinase activation was assessed using quantitative immunoblots with an antibody specific for the activated (phosphorylated) form of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. The total amount of MAP kinase was not different between the two cell lines utilized (Fig. 5 A). Agonist-promoted activation of MAP kinase was significantly different between the two receptors (Fig. 5), with results expressed both as the agonist-promoted fold increase over basal levels of activated MAP kinase and as the percent of the thrombin response. In five such experiments, MAP kinase activity in Del322–325-expressing cells in response to 10 μm epinephrine was 57.8 ± 7.0% of the WTα2CAR response (p < 0.005). When normalized to the thrombin response, epinephrine-stimulated MAP kinase activity was 37 ± 5.7% for the polymorphic receptor compared with 128 ± 10.0% for the wild-type α2CAR (p < 0.005). Recent studies have begun to elucidate specific functions for the α2CAR subtype. In situ mRNA and immunohistochemical analysis of α2CAR expression has revealed a distinct pattern of expression in rat brain and spinal cord (29Rosin D.L. Talley E.M. Lee A. Stornetta R.L. Gaylinn B.D. Guyenet P.G. Lynch K.R. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 372: 135-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 30Shi T.J. Winzer-Serhan U. Leslie F. Hokfelt T. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 2835-2839Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). α2CARs have been localized primarily in the neuronal perikarya and to a lesser extent in the proximal dendrites, with high levels of receptor expression detected in the basal ganglia, olfactory tubercle, hippocampus, and cerebral cortex (29Rosin D.L. Talley E.M. Lee A. Stornetta R.L. Gaylinn B.D. Guyenet P.G. Lynch K.R. J. Comp. Neurol. 1996; 372: 135-165Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data along with studies of genetically engineered mice indicate that the α2CAR subtype plays explicit roles in cognitive and behavioral functions. Studies of mice that overexpress or that have targeted inactivation of the α2CAR gene have shown that this receptor is involved in the regulation of spontaneous motor activity as well as agonist-induced regulation of body temperature and dopamine metabolism (2Sallinen J. Link R.E. Haapalinna A. Viitamaa T. Kulatunga M. Kobilka B.K. Macdonald E. Pelto-Huikko M. Leino T. Barsh G.S. Scheinin M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 36-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In addition, results indicating that activation of α2CAR reduces hyperreactivity and impulsivity have also been reported (3Sallinen J. Haapalinna A. Viitamaa T. Kobilka B.K. Scheinin M. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 3035-3042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These studies show that lack of α2CAR expression is associated with increased startle reactivity, reduced prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex, and isolation-induced attack latency, whereas overexpression of α2CAR produces the opposite effects. Consistent with these data, in humans, the α2AR agonist clonidine and the α2AR antagonist idazoxan reduce and facilitate the acoustic startle response, respectively (31Morgan C.A. Southwick S.M. Gillon C. Davis M. Krystal J.H. Charney D.S. Psychopharmacology. 1993; 110: 342-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 32Kumari V. Cotter P. Corr P.J. Gray J.A. Psychopharmacology. 1996; 123: 353-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The role of α2CAR in modulating working memory has also been characterized (4Tanila H. Mustonen K. Sallinen J. Scheinin M. Riekkinen Jr., P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 599-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In these studies, α2CAR knockout mice performed less accurately in a delayed alternation task and displayed slowed motor initiation in the return phase of the task, supporting a role for the α2CAR in the cognitive aspect of response preparation. α2CAR knockout mice were also impaired in spatial and nonspatial water maze tests, thus supporting a role for this receptor in modulating cognitive functions (5Bjorklund M. Sirvio J. Puolivali J. Sallinen J. Jakala P. Scheinin M. Kobilka B.K. Riekkinen Jr., P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), and alteration of α2CAR expression in transgenic mice has also been linked with behavioral despair development and changes in plasma corticosterone levels (11Sallinen J. Haapalinna A. Macdonald E. Viitamaa T. Lahdesmaki J. Rybnikova E. Pelto-Huikko M. Kobilka B.K. Scheinin M. Mol. Psychiatry. 1999; 4: 443-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Recent studies measuring [3H]norepinephrine release from central neurons and cardiac sympathetic nerves have shown that the frequency-release curves for α2CAR-deficient mice are rightward shifted compared with wild-type mice (9Hein L. Altman J.D. Kobilka B.K. Nature. 1999; 402: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the residual agonist-stimulated inhibition of [3H]norepinephrine release observed in α2AAR-deficient mice was not present in mice deficient in both α2A and α2CAR. Thus both subtypes are important in inhibiting neurotransmitter release at these sites. α2CAR mRNA or receptor protein has also been identified in other peripheral sites (10Gavin K.T. Colgan M.P.

Investig. 1998; 45: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) with evidence in some cases indicative of postsynaptic functions (10Gavin K.T. Colgan M.P. Moore D. Shanik G. Docherty J.R. Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Arch. Pharmacol. 1997; 355: 406-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The presence of functionally distinct polymorphic α2CARs may account for interindividual variability in physiological responses or may be the basis of differences in clinical characteristics of diseases where α2CAR function is important. In addition, the Del322–325 polymorphism could conceivably predispose individuals to the development of disease. The response to agonist or antagonist therapeutic agents may also vary depending on receptor genotype. In this regard individuals with Del322–325 might be more sensitive to antagonists because they have receptors that are less responsive to endogenous catecholamines. For agonists, the response or sensitivity would be predicted to be less for those with the polymorphic α2CAR due to its impaired coupling. Given the relatively high frequency of the polymorphism in healthy African-Americans (TableI), modification of a disease or drug response is more likely than predisposition to disease, although all these possibilities need to be explicitly tested. We and others have recently shown that functional polymorphisms of the β2AR indeed appear to have one or more of the above effects in asthma, congestive heart failure, and obesity (35Tan S. Hall I.P. Dewar J. Dow E. Lipworth B. Lancet. 1997; 350: 995-999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar, 36Liggett S.B. Wagoner L.E. Craft L.L. Hornung R.W. Hoit B.D. McIntosh T.C.

Invest. 1997; 100: 3005-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Comings et al. (38Comings D.E. Gade-Andavolu R. Gonzalez N. Blake H. Wu S. MacMurray J.P. Clin. Genet. 1999; 55: 160-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) have found that increased levels of plasma norepinephrine levels in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder with learning disabilities were associated with polymorphisms near the coding regions of the α2A, α2C, and dopamine β-hydroxylase genes. In summary, we have identified a polymorphic α2CAR that consists of a deletion of four amino acids in the third intracellular loop of the receptor. Such a deletion has a significant impact on agonist-promoted formation of the active receptor-G protein ternary complex resulting in significantly altered functional signaling to inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, stimulation of inositol phosphate accumulation, and activation of MAP kinase. For all three effector pathways, the Del322–325 receptor displays markedly impaired coupling. The polymorphism is rare in Caucasians but is ∼10-fold more prevalent in African-Americans with an allele frequency of 0.381. To our knowledge, this is the greatest racial difference in a polymorphism of any G protein-coupled receptor reported to date. Given the extreme phenotype, this locus should be considered a basis for interindividual variation in physiologic responses, disease predisposition or modification, and drug responsiveness.

We screened the entire amino acid sequence of human zyxin for Mena-interacting peptides and found that, as with ActA, proline-rich sequences were the sole zyxin sequences capable of binding to Ena/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) family members in vitro. From this information, we tested zyxin mutants in which the proline-rich sequences were altered. The reduction in Mena/VASP binding was confirmed by peptide tests, immunoprecipitation, and ectopic expression of zyxin variants at the surface of mitochondria. By transfection assays we showed that zyxin interaction with Mena/VASP in vivo enhances the production of actin-rich structures at the apical surface of cells. Microinjection into cells of peptides corresponding to the first proline-rich sequence of zyxin caused the loss of Mena/VASP from focal contacts. Furthermore, these peptides reduced the degree of spreading of cells replated after trypsinization. We conclude that zyxin and proteins that harbor similar proline-rich repeats contribute to the positioning of Mena/VASP proteins.

Because of this property, Listeria has been very instructive in identifying proteins that function in the organization of the actin cytoskeleton of mammalian cells. One protein whose characterization has been aided by study ofListeria is human zyxin. Zyxin is the prototype of a new family of proteins that is located at actin-rich sites in cells of higher eucaryotes (9.Crawford A.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol.

By sequence analysis, other human zyxin-like proteins have been identified, such as the LIM-containing lipoma preferred partner (LPP)1 (11.Petit M.M. Mols R. Schoenmakers E.F. Mandahl N.

The hallmark of zyxin and related proteins is an N-terminal domain that is rich in prolines followed by 3 LIM domains (15.Macalma T. Otte J. Hensler M.E. Bockholt M. Louis H.A. Kalff-Suske M.

Biochem. 1996; 241: 657-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The 380-amino acid proline-rich domain of zyxin has several biochemical and cell biological properties in common with the proline-rich domain ofListeria ActA (17.Golsteyn R.M. Beckerle M.C. Koay T. Friederich E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1893-1906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Niebuhr K. Ebel F. Frank R. Reinhard M. Domann E. Carl U.D. Walter U. Gertler F.B. Wehland J. Chakraborty T.

It is composed of an N-terminal domain that interacts with the Arp2/3 complex to generate actin nucleating activity (21.Welch M.D. Rosenblatt J. Skoble J. Portnoy D.A. Mitchison T.J. Science. 1998; 281: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar) followed by a large proline-rich domain that is believed to be important for accelerating the rate of actin assembly (22.Friederich E.

The sequence similarity between zyxin and ActA has prompted studies on their functional similarities. Similarities between the proline-rich domains of zyxin and ActA have been confirmed by demonstrating the presence of common epitopes and by performing cell transfection assays that showed similar effects of the two proteins on cell behavior (17.Golsteyn R.M. Beckerle M.C. Koay T. Friederich E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1893-1906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Niebuhr K. Ebel F. Frank R. Reinhard M. Domann E. Carl U.D. Walter U. Gertler F.B. Wehland J. Chakraborty T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5433-5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). In addition, both ActA and zyxin bind to members of the Ena/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) family of proteins (25.Chakraborty T. Ebel F. Domann E. Niebuhr K. Gerstel B. Pistor S.

In Listeria-infected cells, VASP and Mena (mammalian ena) are located at the site of actin polymerization on the bacteria (25.Chakraborty T. Ebel F. Domann E. Niebuhr K. Gerstel B. Pistor S.

In cultured mammalian cells, VASP is located at focal adhesions and the distal edge of lamellipodial extensions (9.Crawford A.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol.

VASP is implicated in the control of cytoskeletal organization because it binds F-actin (31.Bachmann C. Fischer L. Walter U. Reinhard M. J. Biol.

In the case of Listeriamovement, disruption of the interaction between ActA and VASP results in Listeria mutants that move more slowly (23.Lasa I. David V. Gouin E. Marchand J.P. Cossart P. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 18: 425-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 24.Smith G.A. Theriot J.A. Portnoy D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 647-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Reconstitution of Listeria movement in vitro with purified proteins has shown that although VASP is not absolutely essential for motility, it increases the rate of bacterial movement (36.Loisel T.P. Boujemaa R. Pantaloni D. Carlier M.-F. Nature. 1999; 401: 613-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (803) Google Scholar). The significance of the interaction between zyxin and the Ena/VASP family of proteins has not been directly explored in mammalian cells. Much of what is postulated regarding the function of the proline-rich region of zyxin arises by analogy to studies of ActA and has not been tested explicitly for zyxin (10.Beckerle M.C. BioEssays. 1997; 19: 949-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Therefore, we have characterized the interaction of Mena/VASP proteins with zyxin by precise mapping of the amino acids required for binding and by testing the consequences for the cell when this interaction is disrupted. Mutation of one to four key phenylalanine residues in the Ena/VASP-binding sites of zyxin progressively abrogates its ability to bind these partners in vivo. In tests in which we place zyxin at the plasma membrane, we find that the presence of VASP- and Mena-binding sites promotes the production of actin-rich structures. In addition, we show that peptides corresponding to the amino acid sequences required for Mena/VASP interaction with zyxin disturb the subcellular distribution of Mena and VASP and inhibit the rate of cell spreading on fibronectin. Our results support the hypothesis that zyxin makes a critical contribution to the correct subcellular distribution of Mena and VASP and that this interaction might be important for the restructuring of the actin cytoskeleton. Peptides were synthesized and purified at the University of Utah core facility or by Genosys (TX). Peptides were synthesized with an N-terminal cysteine. Lyophilized peptides were resuspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline, and the pH was adjusted to 7.5 when necessary. Peptide stocks were prepared at a concentration of 20 (120 mm) or 0.2 mg/ml (1.2 mm) and stored in aliquots at −20 °C until needed. The sequence of the Zyx-(67–81)-peptide is PPEDFPLPPPPLAGD, and the sequence of the Zyx-(67–81)-F71A peptide is PPEDAPLPPPPLAGD. Protein binding studies were performed using a bacterially expressed GST fusion protein containing amino acids 6–170 of the N terminus of Mena (kindly supplied by Frank Gertler), which includes the EVH1 domain (GST-Mena-(6–170)) (27.Gertler F.B. Niebuhr K. Reinhard M. Wehland J. Soriano P. Cell. 1996; 87: 227-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) that was radiolabeled with 32P using bovine heart muscle kinase (Sigma). Labeled GST-Mena-(6–170) was used to probe the SPOTs membrane using a modified blot overlay procedure. Autoradiography was performed at −80 °C using an intensifying screen. Quantitative analysis of protein binding was performed using a PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, CA). Analysis of GST-Mena-(6–170) binding to zyxin was determined using a custom-made peptide library (SPOTs) conjugated to a cellulose membrane (37.Frank R. Tetrahedron. 1992; 48: 9217-9232Crossref Scopus (925) Google Scholar); this SPOTs membrane was generously provided by Jürgen Wehland (Braunschweig, Germany). The library consisted of 187 overlapping peptides of 15 amino acids in length that spanned the complete human zyxin protein sequence. Adjacent peptides shared a 12-amino acid sequence overlap. A second SPOTs membrane (Genosys) was used to determine the effect of amino acid substitution for phenylalanine on EVH1 domain binding to the proline-rich repeats of zyxin. The membrane contained three series of overlapping 15-amino acid peptides corresponding to the first three proline-rich repeats in zyxin and three corresponding series of peptides in which the amino acid substitution had been made. The human zyxin sequence was cloned into the pAlter1 vector (Promega), and mutagenesis reactions were performed using reagents and protocols contained in the Altered Sites II in vitro mutagenesis kit. Amino acid substitution of alanine for phenylalanine at positions 71, 93, 104, and 114 in human zyxin were constructed using mutagenic oligonucleotides that produced a codon change from phenylalanine to alanine. Deletion mutants were constructed using mutagenic oligonucleotides that spanned sequences 5′ and 3′ of the deleted nucleotides. The deleted codons were those for amino acids 69–79 inclusive (Δ1) and amino acids 91–101 inclusive (Δ2). Mutagenesis reactions were verified by sequence analysis. Fragments containing the mutated sequences in human zyxin were introduced by substitution into the NcoI/BglII site of a eucaryotic expression vector containing the N-terminal 380 amino acids of zyxin, except for Nt-zyxin (F71A/F93A/F104A/F114A) (17.Golsteyn R.M. Beckerle M.C. Koay T. Friederich E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1893-1906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expressed zyxin was tagged at the C terminus with the epitope for the mouse 9E10 anti-Myc antibody, followed by 18 amino acids containing the CAAXmembrane-targeting motif of k-Ras (38.Evan G.I. Lewis G. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar). For expression of zyxin at the mitochondria, DNA encoding the zyxin Nt domain was placed in frame with the membrane anchor sequence of ActA (39.Pistor S. Chakraborty T. Walter U. Wehland J. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 517-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected by calcium phosphate DNA precipitation (40.Matthias P.D. Renkawitz R. Grez M. Schutz G. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 1207-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting with anti-Myc antibody was used to confirm expression of zyxin constructs. Extracts were prepared as described (41.Fradelizi J. Friederich E. Beckerle M.C. Golsteyn R.M. BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 484-494PubMed Google Scholar), and epitope-tagged zyxin and associated proteins were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with the anti-Myc antibody. Protein mixtures were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to nitrocellulose, and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-VASP or anti-Mena antibodies. In experiments designed to determine the ability of zyxin mutants to effect the cytoskeletal changes previously shown to be caused by membrane targeting of zyxin, DNA constructs expressing zyxin variants were introduced into HeLa and NIH3T3 cells by transient transfection. Following transfection, cells were fixed and processed for fluorescent double labeling. The actin cytoskeleton was visualized using rhodamine-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, OR). Expressed membrane-targeted zyxin was localized by indirect immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibodies against the Myc tag, followed by FITC-conjugated secondary antibodies. At least 100 cells were counted for each case, in three separate experiments. Data are reported as percentage ± 1 S.D. Potoo tridactyliskidney (PtK2) epithelial cells were plated onto glass coverslips 18–36 h prior to microinjection and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 2% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were injected using an Eppendorf micromanipulator. The peptide concentration in the injection needle was 0.6 mm. FITC-BSA was co-injected with peptides in experiments where cells were also examined by immunofluorescence. PtK2 cells were grown to 80–90% confluence in 100-mm dishes. Cells were trypsinized, washed, and resuspended in sterile phosphate-buffered saline plus 10 mm MgCl2 at a concentration of 2.5 × 106 cells/ml. 0.1 mg/ml of M r 3000 Texas Red-dextran (Molecular Probes, OR) was added to the cell suspension to serve as a marker for introduction of peptides into cells. Peptides were present at a concentration of 0.4 mm. 0.5 ml of cell suspension was placed in 2-mm gap cuvettes and electroporated using a Electrocell Manipulator 600 (BTX Inc., San Diego). Cells were placed on ice for 15 min following electroporation, washed, and plated onto fibronectin-coated coverslips. At 1.5 and 3 h after plating, cells were fixed and stained using FITC-phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Cells were photographed using a Zeiss Axiophot, and the developed negatives were scanned using Adobe Photoshop software, and cell areas were determined for a population of cells using NIH Image software. Data are reported as the mean area ± S.E. 150–200 cell area measurements were determined for each time point. Immunofluorescence analysis of injected cells was performed after a 10-min recovery period at 37 °C. Cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. Primary antibodies used for immunofluorescence were the B38 anti-zyxin serum (15.Macalma T. Otte J. Hensler M.E. Bockholt M. Louis H.A. Kalff-Suske M. Grzeschik K. von der Ahe D. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31470-31478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar), an anti-Mena serum (27.Gertler F.B. Niebuhr K. Reinhard M. Wehland J. Soriano P. Cell. 1996; 87: 227-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar), and a mouse anti-VASP antibody (Transduction Laboratories, KY). Secondary antibodies used were Texas Red goat anti-rabbit IgG, FITC goat anti-rabbit IgG, and Texas Red goat anti-mouse IgG; Texas Red-phalloidin was used to visualize F-actin (Molecular Probes). Cells were photographed using a Zeiss Axiophot, and developed negatives were scanned and processed by Adobe Photoshop software. We were interested in probing the physiological significance of the ability of zyxin to bind Ena/VASP proteins. Therefore, as a first step, we have mapped precisely the sites in zyxin that bind to the N-terminal EVH1 domain of Mena. It was shown previously that zyxin displays several proline-rich sequences similar to those in Listeria ActA that serve as docking sites for Ena/VASP family of proteins (18.Niebuhr K. Ebel F. Frank R. Reinhard M. Domann E. Carl U.D. Walter U. Gertler F.B. Wehland J. Chakraborty T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5433-5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). However, it was not clear if these were the sole sites in zyxin that had the capacity to bind these proteins. Since our goal was to compromise the ability of zyxin to bind Ena/VASP family of proteins and to explore the physiological consequences of this interaction, we precisely mapped the zyxin amino acid sequences capable of binding GST-Mena-(6–170) using a SPOTs custom-synthesized peptide library of 187 peptides that spanned the entire human zyxin sequence. Each peptide was 15 amino acids in length, and adjacent peptides shared a 12-amino acid sequence overlap. This library was probed using radiolabeled, recombinant GST-Mena-(6–170), which contains the Mena EVH1 domain. GST-Mena-(6–170) interacted with four series of zyxin-derived peptides (Fig.1, A and B). These peptides correspond to the so-called “proline-rich” sequences in the N-terminal region of zyxin that had been shown previously to bind Ena/VASP family of proteins and that share high degree of similarity with EVH1 domain binding sequences in ActA (18.Niebuhr K. Ebel F. Frank R. Reinhard M. Domann E. Carl U.D. Walter U. Gertler F.B. Wehland J. Chakraborty T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5433-5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). PhosphorImager analysis was used to quantitate the amount of GST-Mena-(6–170) bound to each peptide sequence (Fig. 1 C). The first proline-rich sequence of zyxin, specifically the peptide that spanned amino acids 67–81 (Fig. 1, A and B, spot A23), showed the highest degree of binding to GST-Mena-(6–170). Binding of GST-Mena-(6–170) to the fourth proline-rich motif which spanned amino acids 109–123 (Fig. 1, A and B, spot B12) was considerably weaker, although, as described later, still significant. The zyxin peptide sequences identified by GST-Mena-(6–170) binding contained a phenylalanine residue which, in the case of ActA, had been shown to be essential for VASP and Mena binding (18.Niebuhr K. Ebel F. Frank R. Reinhard M. Domann E. Carl U.D. Walter U. Gertler F.B. Wehland J. Chakraborty T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5433-5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). We tested the significance of this phenylalanine in the interaction between zyxin-derived peptides and GST-Mena-(6–170) by preparing a membrane in which the conserved phenylalanine residues in peptides A22–24, B5, 6, 9, and 10 were replaced by alanine. Consistent with what was shown for ActA (18.Niebuhr K. Ebel F. Frank R. Reinhard M. Domann E. Carl U.D. Walter U. Gertler F.B. Wehland J. Chakraborty T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5433-5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), this substitution resulted in a loss of GST-Mena-(6–170) binding to the zyxin-derived peptides (Fig. 1 E and data not shown). Importantly, no other EVH1-binding sites were detected in zyxin. The comprehensive characterization of the Ena/VASP-binding sites in zyxin has enabled us to probe the significance of the Mena/VASP binding capacity of zyxin in vivo. The N-terminal domain of zyxin has previously been shown to be sufficient for interaction with Mena and VASP in overlay assays (17.Golsteyn R.M. Beckerle M.C. Koay T. Friederich E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1893-1906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Here we have examined the effects of altering the proline-rich region of zyxin in vivo. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to construct a zyxin plasmid (NtΔ1Δ2) encoding the N-terminal domain of zyxin in which amino acids 69–79 and 91–101 were deleted. The NtΔ1Δ2 plasmid encodes a protein product that lacks the first two proline-rich sequences that together constitute nearly 70% of the Mena binding capacity that we observed. Expression constructs encoding the wild-type N-terminal domain of zyxin (NtWt) or NtΔ1Δ2 zyxin were introduced into cells by transient transfection, and protein expression was confirmed by immunoblotting (Fig. 2 A). Both proteins were produced in similar amounts. Consistent with the reduction in proline content, the NtΔ1Δ2 species migrated faster on gels than the unmodified Nt version (15.Macalma T. Otte J. Hensler M.E. Bockholt M. Louis H.A. Kalff-Suske M. Grzeschik K. von der Ahe D. Beckerle M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31470-31478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). If the proline repeats of zyxin play a central role in docking Ena/VASP family members, we predicted that the production of a zyxin variant that failed to localize to adhesion plaques would act as a dominant negative version of zyxin that would recruit Ena/VASP family members away from their normal residence in the focal adhesions. Consistent with that view, expression of Nt-zyxin, which fails to accumulate in adhesion plaques (Fig. 2 B), results in a loss of VASP from these sites (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, VASP remained concentrated at focal adhesions in cells producing the NtΔ1Δ2 zyxin variant that lacks two of the proline repeats (Fig. 2 D). These results confirm that the proline-rich repeats present in zyxin are important for interaction with an Ena/VASP family member in vivo. We further tested the importance of the proline-rich repeats of zyxin for its interaction with Ena/VASP family members in vivo by immunoprecipitation. We showed previously that targeting zyxin to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, via the addition of a C-terminal CAAX sequence from the protein k-Ras, resulted in changes in actin assembly and organization (17.Golsteyn R.M. Beckerle M.C. Koay T. Friederich E. J. Cell Sci. 1997; 110: 1893-1906Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the findings with the SPOTs membrane with zyxin (Fig. 1) and with ActA (18.Niebuhr K. Ebel F. Frank R. Reinhard M. Domann E. Carl U.D. Walter U. Gertler F.B. Wehland J. Chakraborty T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5433-5444Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), we made site-specific mutations that resulted in the substitution of phenylalanine residues at positions 71, 93, 104, and 114 within the proline-rich Ena/VASP-docking sites. These substitutions were introduced into a construct engineered for the expression of the first 380 amino acids of zyxin, as well as a C-terminal Myc epitope tag and a CAAX sequence. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that Mena exists in a complex with the zyxin variant containing unaltered proline-rich sequences (Fig. 3). Substitution of alanine at position 71 of the first proline-rich sequence or at position 93 in the second proline-rich sequence resulted in a reduction in Mena association with zyxin. Mutant proteins in which two (F71A/F93A) or three (F71A/F93A/F104A) substitutions were made showed very little binding of Mena by immunoblotting. Thus, the degree of Mena interaction with zyxin depended on the number of unaltered proline-rich repeats in zyxin. Similar results were obtained when these zyxin mutants were tested for their ability to interact with VASP (data not shown). To explore further the importance of zyxin proline-rich sequences for docking of Ena/VASP proteins, we examined the interaction between VASP and wild-type zyxin or zyxin Phe-Ala variants in cells by ectopically expressing zyxin at the surface of mitochondria. This method permits the examination of protein assemblages by immunofluorescence and has been previously applied to ActA, zyxin, and a zyxin-related protein, LPP (39.Pistor S. Chakraborty T.

As expected, expression of zyxin Nt at the mitochondria resulted in accumulation of VASP at these organelles (Fig.4, A and B). Interestingly, even when the triple mutant (F71A/F93A/F104A) was expressed, VASP staining could still be detected in association with the mitochondria, although the staining was weaker than when wild-type zyxin sequences were utilized (data not shown). However, when we expressed Nt-zyxin (F71A/F93A/F104A/F114A) in which all EVH1-binding sites were altered, VASP staining was no longer detected at the mitochondria (Fig. 4, C and D). These results reveal that the"

In this study, the involvement of these components in NF-κB activation through a G protein-coupled pathway was examined using transfected HeLa cells that express the B2-type bradykinin (BK) receptor. The function of IKK2, and to a lesser extent, IKK1, was suggested by BK-induced activation of their kinase activities and by the ability of their dominant negative mutants to inhibit BK-induced NF-κB activation. BK-induced NF-κB activation and IKK2 activity were markedly inhibited by RGS3T, a regulator of G protein signaling that inhibits Gαq, and by two Gβγ scavengers. Co-expression of Gαq potentiated BK-induced NF-κB activation, whereas co-expression of either an activated Gαq(Q209L) or Gβ1γ2 induced IKK2 activity and NF-κB activation without BK stimulation. BK-induced NF-κB activation was partially blocked by LY294002 and by a dominant negative mutant of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), suggesting that PI3K is a downstream effector of Gαq and Gβ1γ2 for NF-κB activation. Furthermore, BK could activate the PI3K downstream kinase Akt, whereas a catalytically inactive mutant of Akt inhibited BK-induced NF-κB activation. Taken together, these findings suggest that BK utilizes a signaling pathway that involves Gαq, Gβ1γ2, PI3K, Akt, and IKK for NF-κB activation.

G protein-coupled receptors bradykinin type 2 receptor for bradykinin guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins nuclear factor-κB pertussis toxin regulators of G protein signaling phosphoinositide 3-kinases IκB kinases extracellular signal-regulated kinase tumor necrosis factor-α interleukin-1β green fluorescence protein myristoylated G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs),1 characterized by their heptahelical structure, constitute a large family of cell surface receptors (1Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Biotechnol. 1996; 14: 283-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These receptors are activated by a diverse array of external stimuli including hormones, neurotransmitters, sensory stimuli, chemoattractants and growth factors. GPCRs transduce signals through coupling to a collection of heterotrimeric G proteins, thus generating a broad spectrum of physiological responses (2Bourne H.R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 134-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Increasing evidence indicates that GPCRs actively regulate transcription and gene expression events (3Gutkind J.S. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The signaling pathways connecting GPCRs to several kinase cascades, including the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK1 and ERK2, p38, stress-activated protein kinase, and the c-Jun kinase, have recently been elucidated. Activation of these kinases leads to the expression of c-fos and c-jun, components of the transcription factor activated protein-1 (AP-1), as well as other transcription factors such as MEF and ATF2 (4Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1839-1842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). An increasing number of GPCRs also have been shown to activate nuclear factor (NF)-κB, thereby regulating the expression of a wide array of inducible genes. GPCRs that have been identified for their NF-κB-activating functions respond to a variety of agonists, including leukocyte chemoattractants (5Brach M.A. de Vos S. Arnold C. Gruss H.J. Mertelsmann R.

Invest. 1996; 98: 2042-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). These findings suggest the presence of multiple signaling pathways for NF-κB activation by GPCRs. NF-κB is a dimeric, ubiquitously expressed transcription factor that plays a critical role in regulating inducible gene expression in immune and inflammatory responses (18Baldwin A.S.J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 649-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (5551) Google Scholar, 19Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). The target genes that are regulated by NF-κB include cytokines, chemokines, cell adhesion molecules, growth factors, and immunoreceptors (20Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). In most cells, NF-κB proteins exist in the cytoplasm in an inactive complex bound to the IκB family of inhibitory proteins. Various stimuli can induce rapid phosphorylation, ubiquitinylation, and degradation of IκBα, resulting in nuclear translocation of NF-κB proteins and transcription activation. A key regulatory step in this pathway is the activation of a high molecular weight IκB kinase (IKK) complex, in which catalysis is believed to be carried out by multiple kinases including IKK1 (IKKα) and IKK2 (IKKβ) (19Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar). Much effort has been made in understanding the signal transduction pathways that regulate NF-κB activation in response to proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β). NF-κB activation by these inflammatory cytokines is initiated by the intracellular signaling molecules TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAF2 and TRAF6), and may involve transforming growth factor β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK), and IKKs (19Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (999) Google Scholar, 20Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). More recent studies suggest an additional NF-κB activation pathway consisting of the phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K) and its downstream kinase Akt (also termed protein kinase B, or PKB) (21Reddy S.A. Huang J.H. Liao W.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29167-29173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 22Kane L.P. Shapiro V.S. Stokoe D. Weiss A. Curr.

Nature. 1999; 401: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1883) Google Scholar). These findings demonstrate the presence of parallel signaling pathways that converge at the point of IKK activation. The GPCRs known to activate NF-κB couple to different G proteins, including Gαq, Gα13, Gαi, and Gα16. However, a detailed mechanism underlying GPCR-induced NF-κB activation, including the relative contribution of Gα and Gβγ proteins and their downstream effectors, has not been delineated. The B2-type bradykinin receptor (B2BKR) is known to couple to multiple Gα proteins (24Liao J.K. Homcy C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2168-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 25Wilk-Blaszczak M.A. Singer W.D. Quill T. Miller B. Frost J.A. Sternweis P.C. Belardetti F. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4094-4100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has been reported to activate NF-κB (17Pan Z.K. Zuraw B.L. Lung C.C. Prossnitz E.R. Browning D.D. Ye R.D. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 2042-2049Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). This study employs B2BKR in a transient transfection model to investigate the specific involvement of Gα and Gβγ proteins in NF-κB activation. In addition, as a preliminary effort to delineate the signaling pathways downstream of heterotrimeric G proteins, we demonstrate that stimulation of NF-κB by this receptor is primarily mediated by IKK2 in a process that involves PI3K and Akt. Bradykinin was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Pertussis toxin (PTX) was from List Laboratories (Campbell, CA). LY294002 was obtained from CalBiochem (San Diego, CA). Reagents for luciferase assays and the plasmid pCMVβ were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). A luciferase reporter plasmid was constructed by ligation of three κB binding sequences (5′-AGGGGACTTTCCCA-3′) in tandem into the pGL2-Luc vector (Promega) upstream from the firefly luciferase cDNA. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression vector EGFP-N1 was from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). Plasmids containing cDNA inserts for wild-type and constitutively activated Gα proteins were gifts from Drs. Cindy Knall and Gary Johnson (National Jewish Center, Denver, CO), and their characterization was detailed previously (26Dhanasekaran N. Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. Endocr. Rev. 1995; 16: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The Gβ1and Gγ2 constructs were gifts from Dr. Tatyana Voyno-Yasenetskaya (University of Illinois, Chicago). Expression plasmids for RGS3 and RGS3T were kindly provided by Dr. Nickolai Dulin (University of Illinois, Chicago) and were described previously (27Dulin N.O. Sorokin A. Reed E. Elliott S. Kehrl J.H. Dunn M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 714-723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression vectors of Gβγ scavengers, bovine transducin, and T8βARK-myc with a βARK carboxyl-terminal fragment were kindly provided by Dr. Heidi Hamm (Northwestern University, Chicago) and Dr. Sivio Gutkind (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD), respectively. The expression vector of the dominant negative mutant of p85 (Δp85) was prepared as described previously (28Hara K. Yonezawa K. Sakaue H. Ando A. Kotani K. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. Ueda H. Stephens L. Jackson T.R. et al.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7415-7419Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The constructs of wild-type, constitutively activated, and kinase-deficient mutants of Akt/PKB were described elsewhere (29Gingras A.C. Kennedy S.G. O'Leary M.A. Sonenberg N. Hay N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 502-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar). The expression vector of a dominant negative IκBα (IκBαm) was a gift from Dr. Inder Verma (The Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). Preparation of the wild-type and dominant negative mutants of IKK1 and IKK2 in an expression vector were described previously (30Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J.

Chem. 1998; 273: 30410-30414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The human B2BKR expression construct was prepared by polymerase chain reaction cloning of the entire coding sequence into the pRK5 expression vector (PharMingen, San Diego, CA). HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 international units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. One day prior to transfection, the cells were seeded in 6-well cell culture plates to give a final density of 40–60% confluency (∼5 × 105 cells/well). Cells were transfected with the κB-luciferase reporter, EGFP-N1, B2BKR expression vector, and other expression constructs as indicated in the text and figure legends. Transient transfection was performed using LipofectAMINE Plus reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.), with 0.2 μg of each DNA construct except as indicated in the figure legends. When necessary, additional DNA (pCMVβ) was added to make total DNA of 1 μg/well. 24 h after transfection, cells were starved in serum-free medium for 16 h and then stimulated with control solvent, 10 nm BK, 50 ng/ml TNFα, or 40 ng/ml IL-1β for 5 h. The κB-directed expression of firefly luciferase was determined using luciferase assay reagents from Promega, and the resultant luciferase activities were measured with a Femtomaster FB12 luminometer (Berthold Detection Systems, Pforzheim, Germany). Relative transfection efficiency and protein expression levels in each sample were determined by measurement of fluorescent intensity of the co-transfected GFP in a spectrofluorometer (Photon Technologies International, Monmouth Junction, NJ), with excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 507 nm, respectively. Luciferase activities were then normalized against the level of GFP expression to minimize differences in transfection and protein expression efficiency among samples. Cell surface expression of B2BKR was detected by flow cytometry (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled BK (10 min at 4 °C; NEN Life Science Products) and by immunoblotting (see below). B2BKR expression levels were not altered by co-transfection of the various constructs used in this study. Unless otherwise indicated in the figure legends, all data were collected from three independent experiments, each in duplicate. Normalized data were plotted using Prism software (Version 2.0; GraphPad, San Diego, CA). HeLa cells were grown in 100-mm cell culture dishes. Transient transfection, culture, serum starvation, and agonist stimulation were done as described above. Cells were then rinsed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and incubated for 20 min at 4 °C in 1 ml of lysis buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.6), 100 mmNaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 20 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mm NaF, and 1× Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set I (CalBiochem). Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min. Cell lysates were incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with 30 μl of anti-HA-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or anti-FLAG-agarose beads (Sigma), then rinsed 3 times with 0.5 ml of lysis buffer, and eluted with 30 μl of HA peptide (Santa Cruz) or FLAG peptide (Sigma). Aliquots of the eluates were used for immunoblot and in vitrophosphorylation assays. Immunoblot analysis was performed with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz), anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (Sigma), or anti-phospho-Akt polyclonal antibody (Ser473; New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The antibodies were visualized with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit Ig (CalBiochem) using enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Quantitative measurement of phosphorylated Akt was conducted using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Mountain View, CA). For the detection of protein expression of the transfected B2BKR and IκBαm, total cell lysates were immunoblotted with an anti-B2BKR monoclonal antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) and an anti-IκBα antibody (New England Biolabs), respectively. For IκB kinase assays, HeLa cells in 100-mm dish were transiently transfected with 4 μg of B2BKR and 1 μg of HA-tagged IKK1 or FLAG-tagged IKK2. Cell culture and serum starvation conditions were the same as in the luciferase assays. Cells were then stimulated with BK or TNFα and lysed. IKKs were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA- or anti-FLAG-agarose beads and then eluted with HA or FLAG peptide, respectively. The IKK activity assay was performed with 3 μl of eluates and 2 μg of GST-IκBα (1–54) in 15 μl of kinase buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 20 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 20 mm p-nitrophenylphosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm ATP, 20 mm creatine phosphate, 1× Protease Inhibitor Mixture Set I (CalBiochem), and 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (10 mCi/ml, 6,000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), at 37 °C for 30 min. Samples were subsequently analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. The expression vector for GST-IκBα (1–54) was constructed, and the proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli as described previously (32DiDonato J. Mercurio F. Rosette C. Wu-Li J. Suyang H. Ghosh S. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1295-1304Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the Akt kinase assay, HeLa cells in 100-mm dishes were transfected with 4 μg of B2BKR and 1 μg of HA-tagged Akt, cultured and serum-starved as described above, and stimulated with 10 nmBK or 50 ng/ml TNFα for indicated time periods. Cells were lysed, and Akt was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA-agarose beads and then eluted with HA peptide. Akt kinase activity assay was performed with 15 μl of eluates and 0.4 μg of Akt-specific substrate peptide (RPRAATF, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) in 15 μl of 2× kinase buffer at 37 °C for 20 min. Samples were subsequently transferred to P81 phosphocellulose squares (Upstate Biotechnology), rinsed 10 times with 50 ml of 0.75% phosphoric acid, dehydrated in acetone, and dissolved in 5 ml of scintillation fluid. The resultant radioactivity was determined with a Beckman LS 3801 scintillation counter. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with a κB-directed luciferase reporter and an expression vector containing the human B2BKR cDNA. Mock (vector)-transfected cells did not respond to BK (up to 100 nm) in luciferase reporter assay (Fig. 1 A) because the untransfected HeLa cells do not express B2BKR (Fig. 1 C and data not shown). In B2BKR-transfected cells, BK induced κB-directed luciferase activities in a dose-dependent manner from 0.1 to 500 nm (Fig. 1 A). To determine whether BK-induced NF-κB activation requires IκBα phosphorylation, a dominant negative mouse IκBα (IκBαm) devoid of inducible phosphorylation (33Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M. Science. 1996; 274: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar) was co-expressed in the HeLa cells. IκBαm abolished BK-induced NF-κB activation as well as that induced by TNFα and IL-1β (Fig. 1 B). Expression of B2BKR was not affected by the co-transfection of IκBαm, as evidenced by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 C) and flow cytometry (data not shown). These results indicate that phosphorylation of IκBα at Ser32 and Ser36 is critical for BK-induced NF-κB activation. Receptors for several cytokines and lipopolysaccharide preferentially utilize IKK2 for NF-κB activation (30Mercurio F. Zhu H. Murray B.W. Shevchenko A. Bennett B.L. Li J. Young D.B. Barbosa M. Mann M. Manning A. Rao A. Science. 1997; 278: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (1841) Google Scholar, 31O'Connell M.A. Bennett B.L. Mercurio F. Manning A.M. Mackman N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 30410-30414Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). We examined whether this is also the case for BK-induced NF-κB activation. The K44M mutants of IKK1 and IKK2, which had been shown to block cytokine-induced NF-κB activation, were co-expressed in the transfected HeLa cells. As shown in Fig. 2 A, expression of IKK1.DN reduced BK-stimulated NF-κB activation by approximately 25%. A more potent inhibition (∼60%) was obtained when IKK2.DN was co-transfected into the HeLa cells. When used together, these two dominant negative constructs produced further inhibition of BK-induced NF-κB activation. The inhibition of BK-induced NF-κB activation was not due to the reduced expression of B2BKR, because co-transfection of IKK1.DN or IKK2.DN did not affect the expression of B2BKR (Fig.2 B). Similar levels of inhibition were observed in the control cells that were stimulated with TNFα, suggesting that BK, like TNFα, preferentially activates IKK2. This notion was further supported by IKK assays that employed GST-IκBα (1–54) as a substrate. Results shown in Fig. 2, C and D,indicate that, although BK activated both IKK1 and IKK2 with peak activation at 15 min, the IKK1 activity was transient, whereas the IKK2 activity was more sustained. These results combined suggest an important role of IKK2 in BK-induced NF-κB activation. IKK2 assay was used in subsequent experiments as an additional measure for G protein-mediated functions. B2BKR couples to heterotrimeric G proteins of the Gαi, Gαq/11, and Gα13 classes (24Liao J.K. Homcy C.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 2168-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 25Wilk-Blaszczak M.A. Singer W.D. Quill T. Miller B. Frost J.A. Sternweis P.C. Belardetti F. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 4094-4100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, BK may also couple to Gαs under certain circumstances (34Liebmann C. Graness A. Ludwig B. Adomeit A. Boehmer A. Boehmer F.D. Nurnberg B. Wetzker R. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 109-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To determine which Gα protein(s) is responsible for BK-induced NF-κB activation, the transfected HeLa cells were first treated with PTX. Our results showed that PTX, at concentrations sufficient to block fMet-Leu-Phe induced calcium mobilization and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate hydrolysis (data not shown), did not alter NF-κB activation by BK, TNFα, or IL-1β (Fig. 3 A). Consistent with this finding, PTX did not affect IKK2 activation induced by either BK or TNFα (Fig. 3 B). We hypothesized that PTX-insensitive Gα proteins are responsible for BK-induced NF-κB activation. To evaluate this hypothesis, the wild-type Gαq, Gα13, and Gαi2 were separately co-expressed in HeLa cells. In the absence of BK stimulation, these Gα proteins produced small increases in κB-directed luciferase activity (Fig.4 A). Following BK stimulation, the cells expressing Gαq exhibited an ∼75% increase over the level of luciferase activity induced by BK alone, whereas a smaller (∼20%) increase was observed in the cells expressing Gα13. In contrast, Gαi2 reduced the level of BK-stimulated luciferase activity by ∼20%.Figure 4A role of Gαq in BK-induced NF-κB activation. A, Gαq potentiates BK-induced NF-κB activation in luciferase assays. HeLa cells were transiently transfected with 0.2 μg each of the expression plasmids for Gαq, Gα13, and Gαi2. After culture and serum starvation, the cells were stimulated with control solvent (CTL) or 5 nm BK for 5 h prior to luciferase assay. Relative luciferase activities (RLA) presented are the means and S.D. from two independent experiments, each with duplicate measurements. B, HeLa cells were transfected as above, without (open bars) or with (solid bars) a RGS3T expression construct (0.2 μg). The effects of RGS3T on the luciferase activities induced by BK (10 nm), TNFα (50 ng/ml), and IL-1β (40 ng/ml) were measured and expressed as fold induction. C, the effect of RGS3T on IKK2 kinase activity in cells stimulated with BK (10 nm, 15 min) or TNFα (50 ng/ml, 10 min). Various concentrations of RGS3T expression plasmid were used as indicated. GST-IκBα-(1–54) was used as a substrate in the kinase activity assay. The 32P-labeled (top) and Coomassie Blue-stained (middle) substrates as well as the immunoblot of wild-type IKK2 (IKK2.WT, bottom) are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Previous studies have shown that Gα12 and Gα13 activate serum responsive factor through the downstream effector RhoA (35Fromm C.

Gα13 presumably can also activate NF-κB through this mechanism, since GTPases of the Rho family have been implicated in NF-κB activation (38Perona R. Montaner S. Saniger L. Sanchez-Perez I. Bravo R.

In this study we focused on Gαq because it had not been previously shown to stimulate NF-κB activation and because expression of Gαq produced a potent enhancement of the BK-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 3 A). To further examine the role of Gαq, HeLa cells were co-transfected with expression vectors encoding RGS3, a regulator of G protein signaling, and its shortened form, RGS3T (27Dulin N.O. Sorokin A. Reed E. Elliott S. Kehrl J.H. Dunn M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 714-723Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Chatterjee T.K. Eapen A.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15481-15487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). RGS proteins can function as GTPase-activating proteins (GAP), which facilitate the conversion of Gα·GTP to Gα·GDP and thereby negatively regulate heterotrimeric G protein activation (41Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar, 42Kehrl J.H. Immunity. 1998; 8: 1-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). RGS3T has been shown to be a more potent inhibitor of Gαq than RGS3 (40Chatterjee T.K. Eapen A.K. Fisher R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15481-15487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Our results demonstrated that co-expression of RGS3T markedly reduced BK-stimulated luciferase activity (Fig. 4 B). In contrast, the luciferase activities induced by TNFα and IL-1β were only slightly affected by RGS3T (Fig. 4 B). Although less potent, RGS3 also inhibited BK-induced luciferase activity by ∼60% (data not shown). Consistent with these findings, the BK-induced IKK2 activity was inhibited by the co-expressed RGS3T in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.4 C). The lack of inhibition of TNFα-induced IKK2 activity indicates the specificity of RGS3T in G protein-mediated NF-κB activation (Fig. 4 C). Inhibition of Gαq by RGS3T favors accumulation of Gαq·GDP, an inactivated form of Gαq that complexes with Gβγ proteins and limits their functions (41Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1269-1272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Thus the observed inhibitory effect of RGS3T and the potentiation effect of Gαq in the transfected HeLa cells may be a function of Gαq, Gβγ, or both. That Gβγ proteins play a direct role in NF-κB activation was suggested by the co-expression of transducin or a carboxyl-terminal fragment of βARK (T8βARK) (43Crespo P. Cachero T.G. Xu N. Gutkind J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25259-25265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) in the transfected cells. These βγ scavengers reduced BK-stimulated luciferase activity by approximately 65%, while having little effect on NF-κB activation by TNFα and IL-1β (Fig.5, A and B). In agreement with the luciferase reporter data, transducin (Fig.5 C) and T8βARK (not shown) also reduced BK-stimulated IKK2 activity without affecting TNFα-induced IKK2 activity. The direct involvement of Gαq and Gβγ in NF-κB activation was investigated by expression of Gβ1γ2 and a Gαq mutant (Q209L) devoid of GTPase activity in the HeLa cells. Expression of Gαq(Q209L) alone"

Friend of GATA-2 (FOG-2) is a multizinc finger protein that associates with GATA4 and represses GATA4-dependent transcription. To better understand the transcriptional repressor activity of FOG-2 we performed a functional analysis of the FOG-2 protein. The results demonstrated that 1) zinc fingers 1 and 6 of FOG-2 are each capable of interacting with evolutionarily conserved motifs within the N-terminal zinc finger of mammalian GATA proteins, 2) a nuclear localization signal (RKRRK) (amino acids 736–740) is required to program nuclear targeting of FOG-2, and 3) FOG-2 can interact with the transcriptional co-repressor, C-terminal-binding protein-2 via a conserved sequence motif in FOG-2 (PIDLS). Surprisingly, however, this interaction with C-terminal-binding protein-2 is not required for FOG-2-mediated repression of GATA4-dependent transcription. Instead, we have identified a novel N-terminal domain of FOG-2 (amino acids 1–247) that is both necessary and sufficient to repress GATA4-dependent transcription. This N-terminal repressor domain is functionally conserved in the related protein, Friend of GATA1. Taken together, these results define a set of evolutionarily conserved mechanisms by which FOG proteins repress GATA-dependent transcription and thereby form the foundation for genetic studies designed to elucidate the role of FOG-2 in cardiac development.

The N-terminal zinc fingers of GATA proteins have also been shown to mediate functionally important protein-protein interactions. The structurally related zinc finger proteins U-shaped and Friend of GATA1 (FOG)1 were both identified by their ability to bind to the N-terminal zinc finger of the GATA proteins Pannier and GATA1, respectively.

FOG-2 is an 1151-amino acid polypeptide that contains 8 zinc finger motifs and is expressed in the heart, brain, and testis in adult mice. During mouse embryonic development, FOG-2 is first expressed in the developing heart and septum transversum at embryonic day 8.5. It is subsequently expressed in the urogenital ridge, developing gut, and brain (33.Svensson E.C. Tufts R.L. Polk C.E. Leiden J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 956-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 34.Tevosian S.G. Deconinck A.E. Cantor A.B. Rieff H.I. Fujiwara Y. Corfas G. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 950-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In each of these tissues its pattern of expression overlaps with that of one or more GATA proteins. FOG-2 specifically associates with the N-terminal zinc finger of GATA4 and represses GATA4-mediated transcriptional activation of several cardiac-restricted promoters including those from the ANF, BNP, and cTnC genes (33.Svensson E.C. Tufts R.L. Polk C.E. Leiden J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 956-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 34.Tevosian S.G. Deconinck A.E. Cantor A.B. Rieff H.I. Fujiwara Y. Corfas G. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 950-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). In the studies described in this report, we have used in vitro mutagenesis to functionally characterize the FOG-2 protein and to better understand the mechanisms by which it represses GATA4-dependent transcription from cardiac promoters. Our results demonstrate that multiple zinc fingers of FOG-2 are capable of interacting with the N-terminal zinc finger of GATA4. Single amino acid substitutions in conserved residues of the N-terminal zinc finger of GATA4 can abolish FOG-2 binding and transcriptional repression without disrupting the ability of GATA4 to bind to DNA or to activate transcription. We have demonstrated that FOG-2 can physically associate with a potent transcriptional co-repressor, C-terminal-binding protein-2 (CtBP-2). However, this association is not required for FOG-2 to repress the GATA-mediated transcriptional activation of cardiac-restricted promoters. Instead, we have identified a non-CtBP-2-dependent repression domain of FOG-2 located at the N terminus of the protein (aa 1 to 247). This domain is both necessary and sufficient for FOG-2-mediated repression of GATA4-dependent transcription and is functionally conserved in the N-terminal region of FOG. Furthermore, when fused to a Gal4 DNA binding domain, the N-terminal repressor domain of FOG-2 can repress transcription from an SV40 promoter juxtaposed to Gal4 DNA binding sites. Taken together, these results help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which FOG-2 functions to repress GATA4-dependent cardiac transcription and provide the structural basis for ongoing studies designed to understand the biochemical basis of FOG-2-mediated regulation of cardiomyocyte gene expression. PcDNA3-GATA4, pGEX-GATA4, and pcDNA3-FOG-2 have been described previously (33.Svensson E.C. Tufts R.L. Polk C.E. Leiden J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Lazar (University of Pennsylvania). PcDNA3-Nkx2.5 was constructed by using the PCR and primers (5′- GAGAATTCATGAATGGGGTGACGCAGAACTGC and 5′-CTGGGAAAGCAGGAGAGCACTTGG) to generate a 521-bp fragment of the 5′-coding region of Nkx2.5, which was then cloned into the EcoRI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3. A 1-kb XhoI fragment from pBS-Csx was then inserted into the XhoI site of this plasmid. Point mutations in the N-terminal zinc finger of GATA4 were created using PCR-directed mutagenesis with the following oligonucleotides: 5′-TTCCCGGGGACTACTGGGTCCCTG; 5′-GCTCTAGACCCAGACAAAGGGGCTGGCCAAGG; D2, 5′-CTGGAGGCGAGATGGGACGGAACACTACCTGTGCAATGCCTG; and D4, 5′-GGCCCCACAATTGACACACTTTCTGCCTTCTGAGAAGTCAT. These mutant cDNAs were cloned into theEcoRI/XbaI site of pcDNA3 or used as templates to generate via the PCR a 165-bp fragment containing the N- and C-terminal fingers of GATA4 that were subsequently cloned into theEcoRI site of pGEX4T-3. pcDNAFlag was constructed by insertion of an oligonucleotide (5′-AAGCTTACCATGGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAGGATCC) encoding the Flag protein epitope (MDYKDDDDKD) into theHindIII/BamHI sites of pcDNA3. FOG-2 truncations were created as follows: FOG-2-(227–1151) primers (5′-GTGGATCCATTCAGCTGCTTCCTCAGCAAGC and 5′-TTCAGGTGCATTTCTAGAGCTCGG) and the PCR were used to generate a 257-bp fragment that was cloned into the BamHI/XbaI sites of pcDNAFlag. Subsequently, a 3.5-kb XbaI fragment from the FOG-2 cDNA (1208–4770 bp) was cloned into the XbaI site. FOG-2-(534–1151) primers (5′-GTGGATCCAGCTACCCTCCTGTGATTTACAGC and 5′-TTGTGCGCCAGATAGTTCTCGACC) were used to generate a 654-bpBamHI/NotI fragment that was cloned into theBamHI/NotI sites of pcDNAFlag. Subsequently, a 2.2-kb NotI fragment from the FOG-2 cDNA (2526–4770 bp) was cloned into the NotI site. FOG-2-(735–1151) primers (5′-CGGGATCCACGCAAGCGAAGAAAGATGTACG and 5′-GGCTCGAGAACACGGGTACCAAAGGTGACTGC) and the PCR were used to generate a 1.3-kb fragment from the FOG-2 cDNA (2478–3777 bp) that was inserted into the BamHI/XhoI site of pcDNAFlag. FOG-2-(752–1151), a NotI fragment of the FOG-2 cDNA (2562–4770 bp), was cloned into the NotI site of pcDNAFlag. FOG-2-(1–733), a 2.3-kbBamHI/FspI fragment of the FOG-2 cDNA (132–2472 bp), was cloned into the BamHI/EcoRV sites of pcDNA3. FOG-2-(1–506)- pcDNA FOG-2 was digested withEcoRV to remove a 2.9-kb fragment. FOG-2-(1–312)-pcDNA FOG-2 was digested with XbaI to remove a 3.6-kb fragment. FOG-2-(1–247) primers (5′-GAAATTAATACGACTCACTATAGGG and 5′-GGCTCGAGTCCTTATTGACAATAGCTGTAGGC) and the PCR were used to generate a 883-bp fragment of the FOG-2 cDNA (132–1015 bp) that was cloned into the BamHI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3. FOG-2-(1–312)/Gal4, FOG-2-(1–45)/Gal4, FOG-2-(46–195)/Gal4, FOG-2-(183–240)/Gal4, and FOG-2-(241–312)/Gal4 were constructed by cloning the appropriate fragments from the FOG-2 cDNA 3′ of the GAL4 DNA binding domain in the pM vector (CLONTECH). FOG-2-(290–668) primers (5′-GCGGATCCTAACTCGCATCAGGTTTCCAGCCTG and 5′-CCGCTCGAGAACAGGCTTTCCGTTTATTTTGTCG) and the PCR were used to generate a 1.1-kb fragment from the FOG-2 cDNA (1140–2276 bp) that was subsequently inserted into the BamHI/XhoI sites of pcDNAFlag. PcDNA3-CtBP-2 was generated by cloning a 500-bpEcoRI/XhoI fragment encoding the 5′-end of the murine CtBP-2 from an expressed sequence tag clone (GenBankTM accession no. AA433525) into theEcoRI/XhoI site of pcDNA3. Subsequently, aXhoI/XbaI fragment containing the 3′-end of the CtBP-2 cDNA was cloned into the XhoI/XbaI site. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were transfected using 5 μg of DNA and the Superfect reagent (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. All transfections were done in triplicate and contained 200 ng of pVRβ-gal, a reference plasmid containing the cytomegalovirus promoter driving expression of theLacZ gene (33.Svensson E.C. Tufts R.L.

Cells and medium were harvested 48 h later and assayed for growth hormone or luciferase levels, β-galactosidase activity, and total protein content using commercially available kits (Nichols Institute, San Juan Capistrano, CA; Promega, Madison, WI; and Bio-Rad). Growth hormone and luciferase levels were normalized to β-galactosidase activity and total protein content to correct for variations in transfection and cell harvesting efficiencies. NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were transfected with pcDNA3-GATA4, pcDNA3-FOG-2, or both; 48 h after transfection cells were harvested, and nuclear extracts were prepared as described previously (33.Svensson E.C.

Bacteria were grown to mid log-phase and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4 h at 30 °C. Bacteria were sonicated, and the resulting lysates were incubated with 30 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Subsequently, the beads were washed four times with binding buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 μm ZnSO4, β-mercaptoethanol, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, and protease inhibitors), and 5–15 μl of radiolabeled in vitrotranslated full-length or truncated FOG-2 proteins were added in a total volume of 700 μl of binding buffer. After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, the beads were again washed five times, and the bound proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. Anti-FOG-2 antibodies were generated by inoculating rabbits with a purified, bacterially expressed FOG-2 GST fusion protein encoding amino acids 1–247 of the FOG-2 protein (Pocono Rabbit Farm, Canadensis, PA). COS-7 fibroblasts were transfected with pcDNA FOG-2, pcDNA FOG-2-(227–1151), pcDNA FOG-2-(1–733), pcDNA FOG-2-(752–1152), or pcDNA FOG-2-(735–1152) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 10 min and then permeablized using 0.2% Triton X-100 (5 min at room temperature). Subsequently, cells were blocked with 5% fetal bovine serum for 1 h at room temperature and then incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of anti-FOG-2 antibody or mouse monoclonal M5 anti-flag antibody (Eastman Kodak Co.) in 5% fetal bovine serum (1 h, 37 °C). Cells were washed and incubated with a 1:1000 dilution of Cy3-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for 45 min at 37 °C and then washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline. Fluorescence was visualized using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope. We have shown previously that FOG-2 is a potent inhibitor of the GATA4-dependent transactivation of several cardiac-restricted promoters including those from the cTnC, BNP, and ANF genes (33.Svensson E.C. Tufts R.L. Polk C.E. Leiden J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 956-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). To determine if FOG-2 is capable of repressing transcription from these promoters by other transcriptional activators, NIH 3T3 cells were transiently transfected with expression plasmids for GATA4, FOG-2, and Nkx2.5 and a growth hormone reporter plasmid containing 638 bp of the rat ANF promoter that contains functionally important binding sites for both GATA4 and Nkx2.5 (Fig.1). Consistent with previous reports, both GATA4 and Nkx2.5 alone transactivated the ANF promoter more than 150-fold (3.Durocher D. Charron F. Warren R. Schwartz R.J. Nemer M. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5687-5696Crossref PubMed Scopus (551) Google Scholar, 22.Lee Y. Shioi T. Kasahara H. Jobe S.M. Wiese R.J. Markham B.E. Izumo S. Mol. Cell.

Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8231-8239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Moreover, co-transfection of 3T3 cells with both GATA4 and Nkx2.5 expression constructs resulted in the synergistic activation of this promoter by more than 1100-fold. Forced expression of FOG-2 repressed transactivation of the ANF promoter by GATA4 but had no effect on the Nkx2.5-mediated activation of this same promoter. Interestingly, expression of FOG-2 repressed the synergistic activation of the ANF promoter by Nkx2.5 and GATA4, reducing the transactivation of the ANF promoter to the level of activation seen with Nkx2.5 expression alone. These results demonstrated that FOG-2 represses GATA4-dependent but not Nkx2.5-dependent transcription from the ANF promoter and that this repressor function therefore does not reflect a generalized or nonspecific inhibition of ANF promoter activity. Previous studies have identified naturally occurring mutations in the N-terminal zinc finger of the Drosophila GATA protein, Pannier, that abolish its ability to interact with the FOG-2-related Drosophila protein, U-shaped (37.Haenlin M. Cubadda Y. Blondeau F. Heitzler P. Lutz Y. Simpson P. Ramain P. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3096-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Similar mutations in the N-terminal zinc finger of GATA1 have been shown to abolish its interactions with FOG (38.Crispino J.D. Lodish M.B. MacKay J.P. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 219-228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). To test the effects of such mutations on the GATA4-FOG-2 interaction, we used PCR-based mutagenesis to generate single amino acid substitutions in the N-terminal zinc finger of GATA4 (D2 = Gly233 → Glu and D4 = Glu215 → Lys) (Fig. 2 A). Both mutants demonstrated decreased binding to FOG-2 in GST binding assays (Fig.2 B). The D2 mutation reduced FOG-2 binding by 63 ± 9%, whereas the D4 mutation reduced FOG-2 binding by 95 ± 3%. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were used to determine if the D2 or D4 mutations had altered the DNA binding activity of GATA4. In these experiments, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were transfected with expression constructs encoding wild-type or mutant GATA4. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested, and nuclear extracts normalized by Western blot analysis for GATA4 levels were assayed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a radiolabeled probe from the murine cTnC enhancer cardiac enhancer factor-1. As shown in Fig. 2 C, neither the D2 nor the D4 mutation resulted in significant changes in the DNA binding activity of GATA4. Finally, NIH 3T3 cells were transfected with expression constructs encoding FOG-2 and either wild-type, D2, or D4 mutant GATA4 along with a reporter plasmid containing 1 kb of the BNP promoter-driving expression of the human growth hormone gene. The pVRβgal reference plasmid was included in all transfections to normalize for differences in transfection efficiencies. As shown in Fig. 2 D, both the D2 and D4 mutants were able to transactivate the BNP promoter to the same level as wild-type GATA4. Consistent with previous work (33.Svensson E.C. Tufts R.L. Polk C.E. Leiden J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 956-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), FOG-2 repressed the ability of wild-type GATA4 to activate this promoter by ∼10-fold. In contrast, activation of the BNP promoter by the D2 mutant, which displays moderately reduced FOG-2 binding, was only repressed 3-fold by overexpression of FOG-2. Transactivation by the D4 mutant, which fails to interact with FOG-2, was unaffected by FOG-2. These results suggested that the ability of FOG-2 to repress GATA4-mediated transcriptional activation is proportional to its ability to physically interact with the N-terminal zinc finger of GATA4. Moreover, they demonstrated that the susceptibility of GATA4 to FOG-2-dependent repression can be distinguished structurally from its DNA binding and transcriptional activation functions. To more precisely identify the domains of FOG-2 required for GATA4 binding and transcriptional repression, we constructed a series of eukaryotic expression constructs containing N- and C-terminal truncations of FOG-2 (Fig.3 A). These constructs were used to generate 35S-labeled protein for in vitro GST binding reactions as shown in Fig. 3 B. Deletion of aa 1–534, containing zinc fingers 1–4, did not affect the ability of FOG-2 to bind to GATA4 (Fig. 3 B, lane 5). In contrast, the deletion of an additional 218 amino acids (aa 1–752) containing zinc fingers 5 and 6 resulted in a marked reduction in GATA4 binding (Fig. 3 B, lane 6). Deletion of 418 amino acids from the C terminus of FOG-2 (aa 733–1151) also did not affect GATA4 binding (Fig. 3 B, lane 7). However, the further deletion of zinc fingers 5 and 6 resulted in significantly decreased binding to GATA4 (Fig. 3 B,lane 8). As expected, removal of all of the zinc fingers of FOG-2 resulted in the complete loss of GATA4 binding activity (Fig.3 B, lane 10). Interestingly, however, a peptide containing aa 1–312 of FOG-2 and including only zinc finger 1 retained GATA4 binding activity (Fig. 3 B, lane 9) as did a peptide containing aa 1–506 of FOG-2. The decreased binding of aa 1–506 as compared with 1–312 may have reflected differences in the tertiary structures of these various artificial deletion constructs. However, the binding of both aa 1–312 and 1–506 was confirmed in the transcriptional repression assays shown in Fig. 3 C (see below). Interestingly, fusion of zinc finger 6 of FOG-2 to a peptide containing aa 1–247 from the N terminus of the protein also restored GATA4 binding activity (Fig. 3 B, lane 11). In contrast, a peptide containing zinc fingers 2–5 (aa 290–668) was incapable of binding to GATA4 (Fig. 3 B, lane 12). Taken together, these results demonstrated that either zinc finger 1 or zinc finger 6 of FOG-2 are sufficient to mediate binding to GATA4. To better define the protein domain(s) required for the transcriptional repressor activity of FOG-2, we used transient transfection assays to test the ability of the N- and C-terminal deletion mutants shown in Fig. 3 A to repress GATA4-mediated transactivation of the ANF promoter (Fig.3 C). Deletion of aa 1–226 abolished the ability of FOG-2 to repress GATA4-dependent transcription without altering its ability to physically interact with the N-terminal zinc finger of GATA4. In contrast, C-terminal deletions did not significantly affect the ability of FOG-2 to repress GATA4-dependent transcription until all of the zinc fingers were removed, resulting in the loss of GATA4 binding activity. From these experiments, we concluded that aa 1–226 of FOG-2 are required for its transcriptional repressor function. Interestingly, expression of FOG-2 peptides lacking the repression domain (aa 1–226) but containing either aa 227–1151 or aa 290–668 resulted in sup"

Following recognition and activation, the CTL then initiate target cell destruction. The antigenic peptides essential for target cell recognition are generated in the cytosol by proteolytic degradation of predominantly endogenous proteins. The resulting pool of peptides is a possible source for translocation of 7–15-mers by the transporter associated with antigen processing into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Translocated peptides that fulfill the criteria for binding to the available MHC class I allelic products stabilize membrane-bound, empty MHC class I heavy chains in association with β2-microglobulin on the lumenal side of the ER. After release of chaperones and the binding of a suitable peptide to the binding groove, the trimeric complex is shuttled to the cell surface (1.Rammensee H.G. Bachmann J. Stevanovic S.

Treatment of cells with proteasome inhibitors caused a significant reduction not only of the in vitro activity of the proteasome, but also of the surface expression of MHC class I molecules and the corresponding ligands (4.Rock K.L.

Furthermore, in many independent cases, it has been demonstrated that the proteasome is capable of generating MHC class I restricted CTL epitopes and potential MHC class I binding peptides from short synthetic precursors in vivo (5.Craiu A.

Science. 1994; 265: 1234-1237Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), verified the fundamental importance of the proteasome for antigen processing.The 20 S proteasome is a cylindrical particle consisting of 28 subunits in four stacked, heptameric rings with a C2 axis of symmetry. The two outer rings comprise α-subunits, and the inner rings form the central cavity. They consist of β-subunits harboring the catalytically active β5 (X, LMP7), β1 (Y, LMP2), and β2 (Z, MECL-1) subunits, which belong to the family of N-terminal nucleophile hydrolases (11.Groll M.

Substrates probably enter the channel leading to the interior chamber through a narrow constriction in the central portion of the α-ring, which is governed by the N-terminal extensions of the α-subunits. In the absence of SDS, access is restricted to unfolded proteins and short peptides. It has been suggested that this channel gating effect can be overcome by regulatory proteins in vivo and in vitro, e.g. by association of the 20 S proteasome with the 19 S cap regulatory particle (RP) (13.Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).The 26 S proteasome is a complex of the 20 S core and either one or two regulatory particles (14.Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 801-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar). The RP consists of at least 17 subunits forming two subcomplexes, the “base” and the “lid” (15.Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M.

The RP confers ATP dependence and recognition of polyubiquitinated protein substrates, leading to substrate unfolding, deubiquitination, and translocation of the substrate into the 20 S core. It has been shown that transcription from vectors coding for fusion proteins with an N-terminal monoubiquitin ligated either to the influenza nucleoprotein or to a human immunodeficiency virus Nef construct with a destabilizing arginine in position 1 results in enhanced specific lysis of transduced target cells. This is in contrast to the lysis of cells transfected with the same vector without the ubiquitin moiety (16.Townsend A. Bastin J. Gould K. Brownlee G. Andrew M. Coupar B. Boyle D. Chan S. Smith G. J.

The rapid turnover of short-lived proteins and the presentation of resulting fragments on MHC class I molecules depends substantially on conjugation to ubiquitin, as demonstrated with cell-free as well asin vivo model systems (20.Grant E.P.

Immunol. 1996; 157: 617-624PubMed Google Scholar), are degraded via the 26 S pathway without ubiquitin tagging. In the presence of antizyme, recombinant ornithine decarboxylase enharboring the H2-Kb-restricted CTL epitope SIINFEKL from ovalbumin is a suitable substrate for the 26 S proteasome. The latter regulates the production of the intact SIINFEKL epitope and an N-terminally extended precursor peptide with the correct C terminus (26.Ben-Shahar S. Komlosh A. Nadav E. Shaked I. Ziv T.

These findings support the assumption that the proteasome is responsible for the generation of the proper C termini for MHC class I ligands, whereas the generation of the N terminus is more likely to be the result of MHC class I-dependent trimming activities by ER-resident (27.Paz P. Brouwenstijn N. Perry R. Shastri N. Immunity. 1999; 11: 241-251Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and cytosolic aminopeptidases (28.Anton L.C. Snyder H.L.

Analysis of the contribution of the individual β-subunits with yeast mutants has demonstrated a clear correlation between the individual subunits and the cleavage after preferred amino acids (29.Dick T.P.

Furthermore, the analysis of the degradation of the entire protein yeast enolase 1 with yeast 20 S proteasome revealed a processive mechanism of degradation that yielded peptide fragments with an average length of 7–8 amino acids. The digestion of enolase 1 generated diverse fragments that enabled a detailed analysis of the influence of flanking sequences surrounding the cleavage sites. This revealed the significance of the primary sequence composition next to the site of peptide bond hydrolysis (30.Nussbaum A.K. Dick T.P. Keilholz W. Schirle M. Stevanovic S. Dietz K. Heinemeyer W.

The influence of proline in position 4 (P4) upstream from the cleavage site seems to be particularly important. In contrast, only limited data are available for assessing the contribution of the 26 S proteasome to hydrolytic destruction of peptides and entire proteins (24.Tokunaga F. Goto T. Koide T.

Our data demonstrate that 26 S and 20 S proteasomes cleave β-casein in such a way that peptide diversity by differential cleavage site usage is guaranteed, whereby fragments with hydrophobic amino acids, especially leucine, at the C terminus, are preferred in both cases. 26 S and 20 S proteasome appear to operate on the basis of a conserved, underlying matrix for specificity that is distinct from random cleavage of the substrate proteins and is not only common to both conformations from human source, but to the 20 S proteasome from bakers' yeast, too. The mapping of β-casein fragments provides the basis for more detailed knowledge of the integration of the 26 S proteasome into the protein-degrading and antigen-supplying machinery of the cytosol.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurification of 26 S ProteasomeAll steps were carried out at 4 °C. Approximately 250 ml of human red blood cells (erythrocyte concentrate, Bloodbank Universitätsklinikum Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany) were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.2, lysed for 30 min in 1.6× starting volume of buffer A (30 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 1.6 mm dithiothreitol (Sigma-Aldrich), 3.25 mm ATP (Sigma-Aldrich), 5 mmMgCl2). Debris was spun down for 30 min at 10,000 ×g (Sorvall RC-5C Plus, GS-3), and the supernatant was adsorbed to 75 g DEAE-52-Servacel (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany). The batch material was washed three times with 500 ml of buffer B (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 10 mm NaCl, 1.1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm ATP, 10% (v/v) glycerol), 125 mm KCl. Bound material was eluted with buffer B, 250 mm KCl in a total volume of 600 ml (Fig.2 A). Eluted material containing the 26 S proteasome was precipitated with 40% ammonium sulfate and collected by centrifugation (22,000 × g, 30 min, Sorvall RC-5C plus, SS-34) The pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of buffer B, 125 mm KCl, cleared by centrifugation and subjected to FPLC size exclusion chromatography (350 ml of HiPrep Sephacryl S-400 in a XK26/70 column) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and eluted under isocratic conditions (buffer B, 125 mm KCl). Peak fractions displaying half-maximal proteolytic activity against the fluorogenic peptide substrates succinyl-leucyl-leucyl-valyl-tyrosyl-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (suc-LLVY-AMC)(Bachem,Heidelberg, Germany) were collected (Fig.2 D) and the ionic strength slowly adjusted to 75 mm KCl with buffer B. The pooled peak fractions were subjected to FPLC anion exchange chromatography with 75 ml of TSK-DEAE-650S Toyopearl resin (Tosohaas GmbH, Stuttgart, Germany) in a XK16/40 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bound material was eluted with a gradient ranging from buffer B, 75 mm KCl, to buffer B, 500 mm KCl. The proteolytic activity corresponding to the 26 S proteasome eluted in a single peak around 195 mmKCl (Fig. 2 B). Material displaying at least half-maximal proteolytic activity was slowly adjusted to 75 mm KCl with buffer B and subsequently loaded onto 8 ml of arginine-Sepharose-4B resin in a XK16/20 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bound proteasome was eluted with a gradient ranging from buffer B, 75 mm KCl to buffer B, 300 mm KCl (Fig.2 E). The 26 S proteasome peak fraction eluted around 169 mm KCl and was collected and concentrated (BioMax 50-kDa ultrafiltration device, Millipore). Concentrated material was loaded on a 10–40% glycerol gradient (300 μl of concentrated material/12 ml in polyallomer tubes (14 mm × 95 mm); Beckman-Coulter, Munich, Germany). After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 18 h (Beckman ultracentrifuge Optima l-80, SW40Ti), fractions of 500 μl were collected and assayed for proteolytic activity as described above (Fig. 2 F). The recovered 26 S proteasome was stored at 4 °C. Both 26 S proteasome from glycerol density gradient centrifugation as well as concentrated material from the arginine-Sepharose-4B eluate were used in this study.Purification of 20 S ProteasomeHuman 20 S proteasome was purified from material eluting at 250 mm KCl (buffer B) of the crude extract adsorbed by DEAE-52-Servacel (see above). The eluent was chromatographed over gel filtration and anion exchange columns without prior ammonium sulfate precipitation (Fig. 2 C). Subsequently, 20 S proteasome was further purified by chromatography with hydroxyapatite, mono Q, and phenyl-Superose columns as described (32.Kuehn L. Dahlmann B. Gauthier F. Neubauer H.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 991: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).Measurement of Proteolytic Activities against Peptide Substrates with Fluorogenic Leaving GroupsThe fluorogenic peptide substrates suc-LLVY-AMC and H-alanyl-alanyl-phenylalanyl-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (H-AAF-AMC) were prepared from 10 mm stock solutions in Me2SO and used in a final concentration of 100 μm. 50 μl of sample were incubated with 150 μl of buffer C (30 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmATP, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 10 mm KCl) including the fluorogenic substrate in Ultra-Low 96-well plates (Corning Costar Europe, Badhoevedorp, The Netherlands). Fluorescence of the released AMC was determined after 1 h incubation at 37 °C with a Tecan spectrophotometer (Tecan, Crailsheim, Germany) at 360 nm excitation and 430 nm emission. Fluorescence readings of released AMC were recorded as arbitrary (fluorescence) units.Protease InhibitorsLactacystin was purchased from E. J. Corey (Harvard University, Cambridge, MA), and H-alanyl-alanyl-phenylalanyl-chloromethylketone (H-AAF-CMK) was from Sigma-Aldrich. Both inhibitors were used at final concentrations of 50 μm.Protein ConcentrationThe amount of protein in pooled fractions and the final concentrate was determined by a variation of the Lowry method (Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay, Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as a standard. Absorption was measured at 650 nm with a spectrophotometer (Ultrospec 3000, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).Denaturing PAGE5 μg of purified proteasome polypeptides were resolved by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) by standard techniques (33.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206024) Google Scholar) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (DuPont) or nitrocellulose (Sartorius AG, Göttingen, Germany) with a semidry transfer system (CTI).ImmunoblottingDetection of human α2 and human LMP-7 was performed with mouse monoclonal antibody MCP-21 (34.Grusby M.J. Johnson R.S. Papaioannou V.E. Glimcher L.H. Science. 1991; 253: 1417-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) anti-α2 and rabbit polyclonal antiserum anti-LMP-7 (PW8200, Affiniti Research Products Ltd., Mamhead, United Kingdom).Nondenaturing PAGEProtein samples (5 μg/lane) were resolved by nondenaturing PAGE essentially as described by Glickman et al. (13.Glickman M.H. Rubin D.M. Fried V.A. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3149-3162Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nondenaturing minigels were let run at 150 V for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein complexes displaying proteolytic activity were visualized by incubation of the gels for 10 min at 37 °C with suc-LLVY-AMC or H-AAF-AMC and subsequent exposure to UV light (360 nm). Following the fluorescence overlay assay, nondenaturing PAGE gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.In Vitro Degradation of β-CaseinFor degradation of β-casein, 10 μg of proteasome were incubated for 3, 6, and 18 h at 37 °C with 100 μg of β-casein in buffer C in a final volume of 0.5 ml. Data are from incubations with a molar ratio of 1:300 to 1:800 (20 S or 26 S proteasome:β-casein), depending on the relative amounts of CP, RP1CP, and RP2CP. Digests were stopped by freezing the samples at −80 °C.The influence of ATP on β-casein degradation by the 20 S proteasome was tested with 25 μg of 20 S proteasome and 100 μg of β-casein in buffer C with or without ATP (1 mm). Reactions were stopped after 3 and 6 h.Separation and Analysis of Cleavage ProductsPeptide fragments resulting from in vitro degradation of β-casein were separated by reversed phase HPLC (SMART system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) over a μRP C2/C18 SC2.1/10 column. Eluent A consisted of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; eluent B consisted of 0.081% trifluoroacetic acid, 80% acetonitrile. The gradient was 0–70% eluent B in 62.5 min with a flow rate of 150 μl/min. Fractions were collected by peak fractionation with a maximal volume of 500 μl. Peak fractions were dried and redissolved in 40% methanol, 1% formic acid and subsequently analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization/time of flight mass spectrometry (G2025A, Hewlett Packard, Waldbronn, Germany) and automated Edman N-terminal sequencing (Procise 494A pulsed liquid protein sequencer; Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany)Statistical AnalysisComputations were performed using Maple V Release 4 (Waterloo Maple, Inc.).Frequencies of Individual Amino Acids at Certain Positions Relative to Cleavage SitesThe probabilityq(k) for finding a given amino acid exactlyk times in a given position by random selection of cleavage sites (considering that each single peptide bond can be randomly selected only once for each enolase molecule) can be calculated according to the hypergeometric distribution below. q(k)=KkN−Kn−kNnEquation 1 n is the number of observed cleavages under consideration, N is the total number of potential cleavages in β-casein, k is the observed frequency of a given amino acid in a given position relative to the cleavage site, andK is the total number of a given amino acid in β-casein.q(k) values were used to calculate two-sided tail probabilities p to indicate deviation of observed frequencies from a random selection of certain amino acids at a given position. Because we considered positions P6 to P6′ surrounding a cleavage site, the total number of potential cleavage sites (N) in β-casein was reduced from 209 to 199.Comparison of Amino Acid CharacteristicsTo compare the characteristics of amino acids at certain positions for significant differences, the two-sided Student's t test for two independent data sets was performed. Hydropathicity parameters were taken from Kyte and Doolittle (35.Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (16999) Google Scholar), Bulkiness parameters from Zimmermanet al. (36.Zimmerman J.M. Eliezer N. Simha R. J. Theor. Biol. 1968; 21: 170-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar), and normalized frequency parameters for β-turn from Levitt (37.Levitt M. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4277-4285Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). Results are shown as p values and mean value differences including the 95% confidence limit. Only differences with p values <0.05 are reported.DISCUSSIONIn this study we compared the in vitro enzymatic specificities of 26 S and 20 S proteasomes from human erythrocytes. Previous investigations (2.Rock K.L. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1999; 17: 739-779Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar) have concluded that the 20 S proteasome generates short peptides that can bind to MHC class I molecules following translocation by the transporter associated with antigen processing into the ER. In rare cases, the primary products released by the 20 S proteasome into the cytosol already carry the correct C and N termini essential for proper binding to β2-microglobulin/heavy chain dimers (40.Dick T.P. Stevanovic S. Keilholz W. Ruppert T. Koszinowski U. Schild H. Rammensee H.G. Eur. J. Immunol. 1998; 28: 2478-2486Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), whereas other fragments that arise from the central chamber of the self-compartmentalizing multicatalytic core particle function as precursors (8.Dick T.P. Ruppert T. Groettrup M. Kloetzel P.M. Kuehn L. Koszinowski U.H. Stevanovic S. Schild H. Rammensee H.G. Cell. 1996; 86: 253-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar). The precursors are derived from a proteolytic event that in many cases yields the C terminus that fits without further processing into the binding pocket of an empty MHC class I molecule. The N terminus in contrast has to be generated by a different process. Putative ligands with N-terminal elongations are subjected to a process that has been termed trimming (41.Falk K. Rötzschke O. Rammensee H.G. Nature. 1990; 348: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar) by endo- and aminopeptidases in independent or concerted reactions, and evidence has been obtained that such trimming can occur in the cytosol and inside the lumen of the ER (42.Elliott T. Willis A. Cerundolo V. Townsend A. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1481-1491Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Suggested candidates are leucine aminopeptidase (5.Craiu A. Akopian T. Goldberg A. Rock K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10850-10855Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) and tripeptidylpeptidase 2 (TPP2) (39.Geier E. Pfeifer G. Wilm M. Lucchiari-Hartz M. Baumeister W. Eichmann K. Niedermann G. Science. 1999; 283: 978-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) in the cytosol and a group of ER-resident stress proteins that can associate with MHC class I binding peptides (43.Lammert E. Stevanovic S. Brunner J. Rammensee H.G. Schild H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 1685-1690Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 44.Spee P. Neefjes J. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 2441-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar).The participation of proteasomes in antigen presentation is well established, the relative contribution of 20 S and 26 S subtypes is not so clear. Targeting of peptides from minigenes as well as whole proteins to the 26 S proteasome by covalent linkage to ubiquitin leads to epitope generation and enhanced MHC class I restricted CTL recognition (16.Townsend A.

Evidence for the indispensable role of ubiquitin is contradictory and will have to be analyzed in more detail (21.Michalek M.T. Grant E.P. Gramm C. Goldberg A.L. Rock K.L.

We have tested the hypothesis by examining the testis of the UDP-galactose:ceramide galactosyltransferase-deficient mouse, which is incapable of synthesizing seminolipid. Spermatogenesis in homozygous affected males is arrested at the late pachytene stage and the spermatogenic cells degenerate through the apoptotic process. This stage closely follows the phase of rapid seminolipid synthesis in the wild-type mouse.

Suzuki M. Yamakawa T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1973; 73: 77-86PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ishizuka I. Yamakawa T. New Comp. Biochem. 1985; 10: 101-197Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 3Ishizuka I. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 245-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). During spermatogenesis, seminolipid is synthesized rapidly in the early phase of spermatocyte development and maintained in subsequent germ cell stages (4Handa S. Yamato K. Ishizuka I. Suzuki A. Yamakawa T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1974; 75: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 5Kornblatt M.J. Knapp A. Levine M. Schachter H. Murray R.K. Can. J.

This developmentally regulated rapid synthesis suggested a specific and possibly essential function of seminolipid in spermatogenesis (7Lingwood C.A. Can. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1986; 64: 984-992Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) but experimental evidence has been lacking. Firm evidence in support of the speculation would have important bearing to the general concept that cell surface glycoconjugates are important in cellular differentiation, and cell-to-cell interaction (8Hakomori S. Ishizuka I. Robertson S. Encyclopedia of Life Sciences. Macmillan Reference Limited, London2000Google Scholar). Seminolipid is synthesized by sulfation of its precursor, galactosylalkylacylglycerol (GalEAG)1. GalEAG is synthesized by UDP-galactose:ceramide galactosyltransferase (CGT, EC2.4.1.62), which, besides GalEAG, also synthesizes the major myelin galactolipid, galactosylceramide (GalCer), galactosylsphingosine (psychosine), and galactosyldiacylglycerol (GalAAG) (9Morell P.

The CGT-deficient mice recently generated by gene-targeting do not synthesize any of these products and subsequent derivatives of the products (11Coetzee T. Fujita N. Dupree J. Shi R. Blight A.

Thus, the CGT-deficient mouse is an ideal experimental model to examine the consequences of lack of seminolipid to spermatogenesis. This report describes the first definitive evidence that deficient seminolipid biosynthesis indeed causes devastating disruption of the normal spermatogenetic process. The mice heterozygous for the disrupted Cgtgene (11Coetzee T. Fujita N. Dupree J. Shi R. Blight A. Suzuki K. Suzuki K. Popko B.

Testes were dissected and fixed in Bouin's solution overnight. After dehydration, tissues were embedded in paraffin, and 6-μm sections were stained for the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reaction followed by hematoxylin staining. In situ labeling of apoptotic cells was performed on the tissue sections prepared in the same way using the MEBSTAIN Apoptosis kit II (Medical & Biological Laboratory), according to the manufacturer's protocol except that the Vectastain elite ABC kit (Vector) was used for the detection system. The total lipid extract (16Suzuki K. J.

Prog.

Homozygous affected male mice develop severe clinical phenotype early, and thus, it was impossible to ascertain clinically if they were fertile. Anatomically, however, the testis was dramatically impaired in Cgt −/− male mice. The average testis weight of Cgt −/−mice (24.9 ± 1.7 mg; n = 8) was only one-fourth of that of wild-type littermates (97.3 ± 3.5 mg;n = 6) at 8 weeks of age. The size of the epididymis was also reduced in the Cgt −/− male mice. The seminal vesicle, and also the kidney, were smaller but only in proportion to the smaller body of the affected mice (70% of control littermates). RT-PCR analysis of Cgt transcripts in normal adult mice showed that this message was expressed in testis in addition to brain and kidney (Fig. 1 a). Transcripts of the Cgt gene were expressed in the testis from normal mice of all ages and in testicular germ cells of adult mice but were extremely reduced in the testes of KitW/W-v,MgfSl/Sl-d and jsd/jsd mutants (Fig.1 b), in which only undifferentiated spermatogonia and somatic cells were found in the seminiferous tubules (20Kuroda H. Nakayama H. Namiki M. Matsumoto K. Nishimune Y. Kitamura Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 1989; 139: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 21de Rooij D.G. Okabe M. Nishimune Y. Biol. Reprod. 1999; 61: 842-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The result with the KitW/W-v mice is consistent with the deficiency of seminolipid in this mutant mouse (5Kornblatt M.J. Knapp A. Levine M. Schachter H. Murray R.K. Can. J. Biochem. 1974; 52: 689-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Seminolipid levels in other mutants are not known. These results indicated thatCgt mRNA is expressed only in germ cells at the stage later than spermatogonia but not in the somatic cells of the testis. Thus, loss of CGT enzyme activity could cause functional defects specifically in the testicular germ cells. Histological examination showed thatCgt −/− males had a complete disruption of spermatogenesis (Fig. 2,a and b). Testicular germ cells after meiosis were absent in the seminiferous tubules of Cgt −/− mice, whereas spermatogonia and early spermatocytes appeared normal. The Leydig cells and Sertoli cells also appeared normal in Cgt −/− mice. The abnormal seminiferous tubules in adultCgt −/− mice could be divided roughly to three stages of development. The tubules of the first stage had a simple structure consisting of a layer of spermatogonia (Fig.2 c). The second stage consisted of multilayers of spermatocytes at the pachytene stage, together with spermatogonia (Fig.2 d). No spermatocytes beyond this stage could be found in these tubules. The third stage of tubules exhibited cellular degeneration and formation of syncytial multinucleated cells, which were probably produced from spermatocytes at the late pachytene stage (Fig. 2 e). The TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay indicated that the degenerating cells were undergoing apoptotic cell death (Fig. 2 f). To verify the cellular identities and developmental stages disrupted in germ cells in the Cgt −/− testis, testes of Cgt −/− juvenile mice were histologically compared with those of normal littermates at each stage. The first wave of spermatogenesis in juvenile mice results in the appearance of spermatocytes by 10 days after birth (22Bellvé A. Cavicchia J.C. Millette C.F. O'Brien D.A. Bhatnagar Y.M. Dym M. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 68-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). At 14 days, spermatocytes at the pachytene stage emerge. Until 15 days, morphological features of the testis of the Cgt −/− mice were indistinguishable from those of wild-type and the Cgt+/− mice (Fig. 2, g and h). By 17–18 days, anomalous features similar to those in the third stage of tubules in the adultCgt−/− mice described above were readily detectable in the testis of the Cgt−/− mice (Fig. 2, i and j). These results indicated that morphological defects developed during the late pachytene stage, but not in the zygotene and early pachytene stages, of the spermatocyte development. We further tried to verify the stage of the developmental arrest of spermatogenic cells in Cgt−/− mice using RT-PCR analyses for transcripts of genes, expression of which is known to be developmentally programmed during spermatogenesis (Fig.3). Expression of Dmc1 gene occurs in early stages of spermatogenesis in wild-type mice (23Habu T. Taki T. West A. Nishimune Y. Morita T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 470-477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and that of Sycp3 in early meiosis (24Klink A. Lee M. Cooke H.J. Mamm. Genome. 1997; 8: 376-377Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The transcripts from these genes were present in testis of Cgt−/−mice. Expression of Hsp70-2, Clgn (encoding calmegin), HoxA4, H1f3 (encoding histone H1t),Sprm-1, and Cremτ genes was reduced in Cgt−/− mice. These genes are reported to be expressed in primary spermatocytes at the late pachytene stage (25Dix D.J. Allen J.W. Collins B.W. Mori C. Nakamura N. Poorman-Allen P. Goulding E.H. Eddy E.M. Proc.

Expression of Ccna1 (encoding cyclin A1) gene is reported to occur at the end of prophase of meiosis I (31Sweeney C. Murphy M. Kubelka M. Ravnik S.E. Hawkins C.F. Wolgemuth D.J. Carrington M. Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 53-64PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of this gene was drastically reduced in Cgt−/−mice. Expression of the Hsc70t gene begins in spermatids in wild-type mice (15Tsunekawa N. Matsumoto M. Tone S. Nishida T. Fujimoto H. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1999; 52: 383-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Transcripts from this gene were undetectable in Cgt−/− mice. These results collectively indicated that spermatogenic cells of Cgt−/−mice arrested their differentiation program before reaching the first meiotic division. They are consistent with the morphological observation that differentiation of the spermatogenic cells of Cgt−/− mice is affected at the late pachytene spermatocyte stage. By LSIMS, the putative bands on the TLC plates were identified as seminolipid (32Kushi Y. Handa S. Ishizuka I. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1985; 97: 419-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and GalEAG with the major molecular species of 16:0 alcohol and fatty acid (data not shown). At 10 days after birth, normal testis contained definite levels of GalEAG (55 nmol/g wet tissue) and seminolipid (77 nmol/g) (Fig.4 a). By 12 days just before spermatocytes normally begin to appear at the zygotene stage (22Bellvé A. Cavicchia J.C. Millette C.F. O'Brien D.A. Bhatnagar Y.M. Dym M. J. Cell Biol. 1977; 74: 68-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar), the levels of seminolipid and GalEAG dramatically increased to 483 and 214 nmol/g, respectively. The level of seminolipid then increased gradually up to 699 nmol/g at 17 days after birth, while that of GalEAG remained constant (208 nmol/g at 17 days) (Fig. 4, b—d). The appearance and increase of seminolipid at 10 and 12 days, respectively, coincide with the beginning of incorporation of [35S]sulfate into seminolipid of mouse testis at 11 days (2Ishizuka I. Yamakawa T. New Comp. Biochem. 1985; 10: 101-197Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar). At 7–12 weeks, the seminolipid level was reduced in Cgt+/− mice (557 nmol/g) compared with that in wild-type mice (816 nmol/g). Both in wild-type mice and heterozygotes, the adult testis had reduced level of GalEAG (∼70 nmol/g) as compared with the juvenile testis of 12–17 days of age (∼200 nmol/g, see above) in agreement with the levels reported in other mammalian species (3Ishizuka I. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 245-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In contrast, seminolipid and GalEAG were not detectable in the testis of the CGT-deficient mice at any stage of development (Fig. 4,e and f). Among monohexosylceramide (HexCer), only glucosylceramide (GlcCer), but not GalCer, was detected in all genotypes (Fig. 4). In the testes of wild-type mice and heterozygotes, the major molecular species of GlcCer contained 16:0 fatty acid and d18:1 sphingosine, while appearance of a 2-hydroxy 16:0-containing molecular species, GlcCer (16h:0/d18:1), was noted in the testes of Cgt−/− mice. The level of cholesterol 3-sulfate (wild-type, 16 nmol/g;Cgt+/−, 19 nmol/g;Cgt−/−, 20 nmol/g) and TLC profiles of gangliosides and major phospholipids and the molecular species of sphingomyelin (primarily 16:0/d18:1) were essentially similar across genotypes. Thus, seminolipid and GalEAG, which should normally be synthesized in primary spermatocytes from either the end of the leptotene stage or the beginning of the zygotene stage and later (4Handa S. Yamato K. Ishizuka I. Suzuki A. Yamakawa T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1974; 75: 77-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), are the only defective glycolipids in the testis of CGT-deficient mice. Seminolipid, as its name implies, is present at an unusually high concentration in normal testis and its appearance is developmentally regulated (for reviews, see Refs. 2Ishizuka I. Yamakawa T. New Comp. Biochem. 1985; 10: 101-197Crossref Scopus (64) Google Scholar and 3Ishizuka I. Prog. Lipid Res. 1997; 36: 245-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This led to a long standing speculation that seminolipid plays an important role in the normal spermatogenesis process in the testis. However, evidence was only circumstantial and no direct experimental proof for the hypothesis has been available. Our observations have clearly established that 1) mice genetically deficient in CGT are unable to synthesize the precursor, GalEAG, and consequently its sulfated derivative, seminolipid itself; 2) the spermatogenic cells are the only cells in normal testis that expressCgt transcripts and thus are able to synthesize seminolipid; 3) seminolipid and its precursor become readily detectable in normal testis at 12-day-old mice in which spermatocytes develop into the zygotene stage, prior to the pachytene stage; 4) the size of the testis of CGT-deficient mice is one-fourth of normal at 8 weeks; 5) the cycle of spermatogenesis is terminated in Cgt−/−male mice at the late pachytene stage, when the spermatogenic cells that appear to develop and differentiate normally up to this stage degenerate and disappear; and 6) apoptotic cell death may well be the mechanism underlying their degeneration. Collectively, these data indicate strongly that CGT is required for transition of primary spermatocytes through the late meiotic stages and that this process is mediated by seminolipid, thus providing the first experimental evidence for the long standing conjecture that seminolipid is essential for normal spermatogenesis. While our results establish that seminolipid in normal spermatogenesis is essential, the precise molecular mechanisms of two processes remain to be fully understood: the mechanism of the male germ cell degeneration in the absence of seminolipid and the mechanism of the seminolipid function in normal spermatogenesis. Our morphological observation suggests that apoptotic cell death is the underlying mechanism in the degeneration of primary spermatocytes at the late pachytene stage of Cgt−/− mice. Generally, germ cells lacking a gene that is essential for normal spermatogenesis degenerate by apoptosis after the arresting step (for a review, see Ref. 33Sassone-Corsi P. Cell. 1997; 88: 163-166Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The Cgt gene can now be recognized as one of the essential genes for normal spermatogenesis, and apoptosis in these cells could be a consequence of CGT deficiency. What triggers the apoptotic process in the germ cells of Cgt−/− male mice can only be speculated. There is evidence that cellular concentration of certain lipids may be a factor to initiate apoptosis. CGT-deficient mice do not synthesize GalCer and galactosylsulfatide in the brain, but the presence of 2-hydroxy fatty acid-containing GlcCer may partially compensate for the absence of GalCer and galactosylsulfatide (11Coetzee T. Fujita N. Dupree J. Shi R. Blight A. Suzuki K. Suzuki K. Popko B. Cell. 1996; 86: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). In the kidney of CGT-deficient mice, GalCer and galactosylsulfatide are also absent but here again a partial compensation by more polar sulfoglycolipids occurs. 3Tadano-Aritomi, K., Hikita, T., Fujimoto, H., Suzuki, K., and Ishizuka, I. (2000) J. Lipid Res. 41, in press. In the testis of the CGT-deficient mice, however, no lipids increase to compensate for the loss of seminolipid and GalEAG (11Coetzee T. Fujita N. Dupree J. Shi R. Blight A. Suzuki K. Suzuki K. Popko B. Cell. 1996; 86: 209-219Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). The lack of seminolipid and GalEAG without compensatory increases in other lipids may be the primary factor responsible for apoptosis of the germ cells in Cgt−/− male mice. The function of seminolipid in the normal spermatogenesis is even less clear. Several lines of evidence suggest that the temporal and spatial coordination of germ cell differentiation may be mediated by surface interactions between germ cells and Sertoli cells (for a review, see Ref. 34Jegou B. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1993; 147: 25-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Immunological techniques have demonstrated that seminolipid is present on the surface of primary spermatocytes and round spermatids but not on the spermatogonia in rat (35Lingwood C. Schachter H. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 89: 621-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Our present study supports the general idea that cell surface glycolipids are functionally important in germ cell differentiation and/or interactions with other cell types. It must be pointed out that our study leaves one minor ambiguity. Since the CGT-deficient mouse generates neither seminolipid nor its precursor, GalEAG, precise dissection of the functions of the precursor and its sulfated end product, seminolipid, is difficult. The gene of 3′-phosphoadenylylsulfate:galactosylceramide 3′-sulfotransferase (EC2.8.2.11) that sulfates GalEAG to seminolipid, as well as GalCer to galactosylsulfatide, has recently been cloned (36Honke K.

Biochem. 2000; 267: 1909-1916Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The anticipated sulfotransferase knockout mouse should be able to provide the definitive answer as to whether both GalEAG and seminolipid or only either GalEAG or seminolipid are essential for normal spermatogenesis.

Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In yeast two major deadenylation-dependent pathways of mRNA degradation have been defined, the deadenylation-dependent decapping pathway and the 3′-5′ decay pathway (for reviews see Refs. 2Beelman C.A. Parker R. Cell. 1995; 81: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (567) Google Scholar and 3Caponigro G. Parker R. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 233-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The former pathway is initiated by poly(A) tail removal followed by decapping and 5′-3′ exonucleolytic degradation of the decapped mRNA by the Xrn1p 5′ exonuclease. The latter is initiated by deadenylation followed by 3′-5′ exoribonucleolytic degradation of the mRNA. The participating 3′-5′ exonucleases have not yet been unambiguously identified. A multicomponent complex, termed the exosome (4Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Tollervey D. Cell. 1997; 91: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar), has been identified in yeast as well as in human cells, and it contains at least 10 different 3′-5′ exoribonucleases (reviewed in Ref. 5van Hoof A. Parker R. Cell. 1999; 99: 347-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The exosome is involved in 3′ end processing of several different stable RNAs (4Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Shevchenko A. Mann M. Tollervey D. Cell. 1997; 91: 457-466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar,6Allmang C. Kufel J. Chanfreau G. Mitchell P. Petfalski E. Tollervey D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5399-5410Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar) and 3′-5′ degradation of mRNA (7Jacobs-Anderson J.S. Parker R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1497-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). Thus, these exoribonucleases could be responsible for the degradation of mRNA including the poly(A). However, it remains to be established whether any of these exonucleases preferentially or exclusively degrade poly(A) of mRNA. In mammalian cells mRNA decay has been studied extensively, and it has been found that gene expression to a large extent is regulated by changing the stability of an mRNA. From these studies it has been shown that cis-acting elements located in the mRNA body are important elements involved in regulating mRNA decay. One of the first elements to be identified was an AU-rich element located in the 3′-untranslated region of the human lymphokine granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor mRNA (8Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3103) Google Scholar). Shaw and Kamen (8Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3103) Google Scholar) showed that the AU-rich element destabilized an mRNA and that the element could confer the destabilization effect if it was transferred to another mRNA. Furthermore, it has been found, equivalent to the case in yeast, that mRNA decay in mammalian cells in many cases is initiated by poly(A) removal (9Couttet P. Fromont-Racine M. Steel D. Pictet R. Grange T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 5628-5633Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, most of these studies (1Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have been performed in vivo, and therefore, it has been difficult to identify participating components and to address mechanistic details. In the last years several in vitrocell-free mRNA stability systems have been developed, and these systems will make it possible to elucidate mechanistic details and to identify factors regulating mRNA decay in mammalian cells (10Brewer G. Ross J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1697-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 11Brewer G. J. Biol.

Kobs G. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 579-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Using such a system Wilusz and colleagues (13Ford L.P. Watson J. Keene J.D. Wilusz J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 188-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar) have been able to stimulate poly(A) removal and RNA degradation by the presence of an AU-rich sequence element (8Shaw G. Kamen R. Cell. 1986; 46: 659-667Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3103) Google Scholar) in the RNA body and to reproduce regulated aspects of mRNA decay. Similarly, Brewer (11Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34770-34774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) has shown that the 3′-untranslated region of c-Myc affects poly(A) removal and RNA degradation in a different in vitro system. The poly(A)-specific exonucleases responsible for degrading the mRNA poly(A) tails in these in vitro decay systems remains to be identified. Poly(A) tail removal and poly(A) degrading nuclease activities have been studied in several eukaryotic systems (for reviews see Refs. 1Ross J. Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 59: 423-450Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Caponigro G. Parker R. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 233-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, and 15Virtanen A. Åström J. Jeanteur Ph. Prog. Mol.

Earlier studies (reviewed in Ref. 16Bachmann M. Schröder H.C. Messer R. Müller W.E.G. FEBS Lett. 1984; 171: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) were hampered by the lack of RNA substrates resembling polyadenylated mRNA, making it difficult to assay, purify, and characterize nucleases that specifically degraded only the poly(A) tail of an mRNA. By the use of an in vitrotranscribed and polyadenylated mRNA mimic we were able to define a poly(A)-specific 3′ exonuclease in HeLa cell free extracts (17Åström J. Åström A. Virtanen A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3067-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) and propose a reaction pathway for mRNA poly(A) tail removal (18Åström J. Åström A. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18154-18159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Important properties of the HeLa cell activity were its high selectivity for degrading only 3′-located poly(A) tails, its requirement for a 3′-located hydroxyl group, and release of 5′-AMP as the mononucleotide product. Recently, a poly(A)-specific ribonuclease (PARN)1 associated with a 74-kDa polypeptide was purified and characterized in calf thymus extracts by Körner and Wahle (19Körner C.G. Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10448-10456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Human PARN has been molecularly cloned, and PARN activity has been recovered from recombinant 74-kDa polypeptide (20Körner C.G. Wormington M. Muckenthaler M. Schneider S. Dehlin E. Wahle E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5427-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). PARN has also been found in Xenopus and shown to play a role in poly(A) tail removal during meiotic maturation of Xenopus oocytes (20Körner C.G. Wormington M. Muckenthaler M. Schneider S. Dehlin E. Wahle E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5427-5437Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 21Wormington M. Searfoss A.M. Hurney C.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 900-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). A polyribosome-associated 3′ exoribonuclease, having a molecular mass of 33 kDa has been described and purified by Caruccio and Ross (22Caruccio N. Ross J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31814-31821Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this 3′ exoribonuclease is not specific for poly(A), although poly(A) can be degraded. In addition to these metazoan poly(A) degrading nucleases Sachs and colleagues have described a poly(A)-binding protein-dependent poly(A)-specific nuclease in yeast (23Sachs A.B. Davis R.W. Cell. 1989; 58: 857-867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar, 24Sachs A.B. Deardorff J.A.

Poly(A)-specific nuclease is a 3′-5′ exoribonuclease and is composed of at least two polypeptides, Pan2p and Pan3p (26Boeck R. Tarun S. Rieger M. Deardorff J.A. Müller-Auer S. Sachs A.B. J. Biol.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5110-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), suggesting that it harbors the catalytic activity. In this paper we report on the purification of an activity present in calf thymus extracts having the same properties as the poly(A) tail-specific 3′ exonuclease activity we previously described in HeLa cell free extracts (17Åström J. Åström A. Virtanen A. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3067-3071Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 18Åström J. Åström A. Virtanen A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18154-18159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The calf thymus activity has been purified to apparent homogeneity and shown to copurify with a single 54-kDa polypeptide, which we identify as a fragment of the PARN 74-kDa polypeptide. We show that the purified nuclease most likely is oligomeric, acts in a highly processive fashion, and functionally interacts with the m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G cap structure at the 5′ end of the RNA substrate. All steps were performed at 4 °C. Crude whole cell extract was prepared from bovine calf thymus, essentially according to Wahle (29Wahle E. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3131-3139Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In short, frozen calf thymus (2–15 kg) obtained from a local slaughter house was thawed on ice, cut into pieces, and homogenized in an approximately equal volume of buffer 1 (50 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mmK3PO4, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 50 mm KCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol at pH 7.9) using a Waring blender (50 s at low speed and 50 s at high speed). Solid material was precipitated by centrifugation in a Sorvall GSA rotor at 16,000 × g in 4 °C for 60 min. The resulting crude extract was filtered through a test sieve mesh 7-normal (Pascal Eng. Co. Ltd.), 0.134 g/ml NH4(SO4)2(25% saturation) was added and stirred on ice for 2 h, and the precipitate was removed by centrifugation in a Sorvall GSA rotor at 16,000 × g in 4 °C for 60 min. The supernatant was further supplemented with an additional 0.115 g/ml NH4(SO4)2 (45% saturation) and then treated as for the previous precipitation step. The pellet collected after centrifugation was dissolved in 2–4 volumes buffer D (20 mm HEPES-KOH, 100 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 20% glycerol at pH 8.2) and dialyzed for 10 h at 4 °C using dialysis tubing with a molecular mass cut-off at 6000–8000 (Spectra/Por 1 number 132650). After dialysis the 45% ammonium sulfate fraction was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C. Starting with 2.8 kg of calf thymus the obtained extract (∼1038 ml) contained approximately 103 g of protein. The subsequent ammonium sulfate fraction contained 13.7 g of protein in 400 ml. Protein concentration was determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit (number 500-0001) and bovine γ globulin as reference. All steps were performed at 4 °C. A typical protocol starting with 400 ml of crude ammonium sulfate fraction (13.7 g of protein) is given below and summarized in Table I. The ammonium sulfate fraction was added to DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 17-0710-01) ion exchange medium (350 ml of packed matrix) equilibrated with buffer D (see above). Protein was allowed to bind to the matrix under slow stirring for 30 min at 4 °C. Unbound material was removed by washing the matrix with buffer D three times. The suspended matrix was recovered by centrifugation (Sorvall H4000 rotor at 800 rpm for 3 min) after each washing step. The washed matrix was then packed in a column (diameter, 70 mm) and washed (2 column volumes) with buffer D at a flow rate of 12 cm/h. The column was eluted by two salt steps (buffer D supplemented with 0.17 m and 1.0 m KCl), and eluted protein from each step was collected. The nuclease activity, which eluted in the 0.17 m KCl step fraction (1.67 g of protein, 440 ml), was dialyzed against buffer D for 10 h and subsequently fractionated by heparin-Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 17-0467-01) chromatography. A column with bed volume of 130 ml and a diameter of 50 mm was equilibrated with buffer D at flow rate 9 cm/h. The dialyzed DEAE-Sepharose 0.17 m KCl fraction was applied to the heparin-Sepharose CL-6B column at a flow rate of 9 cm/h. The flow through protein fraction was collected, and then the matrix was washed with 350 ml of buffer D. The nuclease activity was subsequently eluted by buffer D supplemented with 0.5m KCl. The eluate (441 mg of protein, 96 ml) was dialyzed against buffer D for 10 h at 4 °C and subsequently fractionated by fast protein liquid chromatography Mono Q HR16/10 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 17-0506-01) chromatography. Protein was loaded (∼48 ml of 0.5 m KCl heparin-Sepharose fraction/turn) onto the buffer D equilibrated Mono Q column using a 50-ml superloop (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 19-7850-01) at flow rate 2 ml/min. After washing with buffer D, the column was developed with a two-step linear gradient (0–25% in 300 ml and 25–55% in 100 ml of buffer D, supplemented with 1.0 m KCl), 9-ml fractions were collected, and active fractions (eluting at ∼10% 1.0 mKCl) were identified, pooled (81.8 mg of protein, 115 ml), and dialyzed against buffer D for 10 h at 4 °C. A 36-ml packed Blue-Sepharose CL-6B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 17-0830-01) column, 26 mm in diameter, was prepared according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The column was equilibrated with buffer D at a flow rate of 34 cm/h. The Mono Q fraction (115 ml) was loaded onto the column followed by a three-step wash procedure of the matrix (100 ml of buffer D, 100 ml of buffer D supplemented with 0.17 m KCl, and 100 ml of buffer D supplemented with 0.3 m KCl). The column was developed with a linear gradient between 0.3 and 1.0m KCl (4.5 column volumes). Active fractions were identified (eluting at ∼0.45 m KCl), pooled (7.88 mg of protein, 105 ml), and dialyzed against buffer D for 10 h at 4 °C. The dialyzed fraction was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −70 °C.Table IPurification of poly(A)-specific 3′ exonucleaseStepProteinActivitySpecific activityYieldPurificationmgunitsunits/mg%foldExtract103,0009,3030.090100Ammonium sulphate13,7206,2030.452675DEAE-Sepharose1,67612,0207.1712979Heparin-Sepharose4412,2835.182557Mono Q81.82,52630.927340Blue-Sepharose7.8810,1771,29110914,2055′ AMP/7-Me-GTP1-aOne quarter of the Blue-Sepharose fraction (1.97 mg protein) was taken through this step of purification as described under “Experimental Procedures.”0.003633211,00072,321,000Purification was monitored by the dual assay strategy and quantitated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” One unit is defined as the release of 1 μmol of AMP/min.

The poly(A)-Sepharose 4B matrix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 17-0860-01) was prepared according to the manufacturer. A HR10/10 column with bed volume of 8 ml was equilibrated with buffer D containing 25 mm KCl at pH 7. 12 ml of the Blue-Sepharose CL-6B fraction was dialyzed for 4 h against 2 × 2 liters of buffer D containing 25 mm KCl at pH 7. The dialyzed fraction was applied to the column at flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was first washed with 5 bed volumes of buffer D containing 25 mm KCl at pH 7 followed by a second wash with 5 bed volumes of buffer D containing 200 mm KCl at pH 6 and a third wash with 5 bed volumes of buffer D containing 280 mm KCl at pH 6. Subsequently, the column was developed with a gradient (5 bed volumes) from 280 to 600 mm KCl at pH 6. Poly(A)-specific exonuclease activity eluted between 300 and 550 mm KCl. This procedure purifies the specific activity of the poly(A)-specific exonuclease approximately 14-fold. All steps were performed at 4 °C. A standard protocol is given below. The 5′-AMP-Sepharose 4B matrix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 17-0620-01) was prepared according to the manufacturer. A HR 5/10 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 18-0388-01) with bed volume of 2 ml was prepared and equilibrated with buffer D containing 50 mm KCl at pH 7. The Blue-Sepharose CL-6B fraction (27.5 ml) was dialyzed against buffer D supplemented with 50 mm KCl at pH 7. The dialyzed fraction was loaded on the column at flow rate 0.2 ml/min. The protein containing flow through fraction was collected. The matrix was washed with 16 ml of buffer D supplemented with 60 mm KCl followed by a 20-ml wash with buffer D supplemented with 0.3 m KCl. Subsequently the column was developed with buffer D using a linear gradient between 0.3–2.0 m KCl (7.5 column volumes). Active fractions (eluting between 0.7–2.0 m KCl) were identified, pooled (15 ml), and dialyzed against buffer D. The matrix 7-methyl-GTP-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 27-5025-01) was prepared according to the manufacturer. A HR 5/5 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 18-0383-01) with bed volume of 1 ml was prepared and equilibrated with buffer D containing 50 mm KCl at pH 7. The dialyzed 5′-AMP-Sepharose fraction was loaded at flow rate 0.2 ml/min. The protein-containing flow through fraction was collected, and subsequently the matrix was washed (10 column volumes) with buffer D at pH 7 supplemented with 50 mm KCl. The bound protein fraction was eluted with a salt step (10 column volume of buffer D supplemented with 2 m KCl). The nuclease activity was identified (eluted during the 2 m KCl step) and pooled (∼0.750 μg of protein as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis and silver staining, 5 ml). To optimize recovery of nuclease activity 0.1 mg/ml of methylated bovine serum albumin (BSA) should be added during dialysis to the pooled fraction of the 5′-AMP-Sepharose chromatographic step and to the final 7-methyl-GTP fraction. The poly(A)-Sepharose fraction (0.7 ml, 0.06 mg/ml protein) was first concentrated by SMART MonoQ PC 1.6/5 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, 17-0671-01) chromatography by the following procedure. The column was equilibrated by buffer D at pH 7 containing 50 mm KCl. The poly(A)-Sepharose fraction was dialyzed against buffer D containing 50 mm KCl at pH 7 and applied to the MonoQ column at flow rate 50 μl/min. Bound material was eluted by increasing the KCl to 500 mm, and fraction size was 25 μl. Active fractions (total volume, 100 μl) were identified and pooled. Subsequently, 50 μl of the concentrated poly(A)-sepharose fraction was fractionated by gel filtration using a SMART Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 column equilibrated with buffer D at pH 7 containing 100 mm KCl. Flow rate was 40 μl/min. Active fractions were identified by in vitrodeadenylation. Molecular size markers were fractionated by the same procedure on the Superdex 200 column. Molecular size markers were ferritin, catalase, aldolase, and BSA having molecular masses 440, 232, 158, and 67 kDa, respectively. The 7-methyl-GTP-Sepharose fraction (50 μl) supplemented with methylated BSA (0.1 mg/ml) was loaded directly onto a SMART Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 column equilibrated in buffer D supplemented with methylated BSA (0.1 mg/ml).

Transcribed RNA was purified according to Moore and Sharp (30Moore C.L. Sharp P.A. Cell. 1985; 41: 845-855Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Conditions for in vitrodeadenylation were 1–1.5 mm MgCl2, 2.5% (w/v) poly(vinyl alcohol) (Sigma P-8136; molecular weight, 10,000), 100 mm KCl, 0.15 units of RNAguard, 5–20 fmol of RNA substrate, 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.25 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, and the indicated amount of protein fraction (18Åström J.

The concentration of the nuclease activity in the purest 5′-AMP/7-methyl-GTP fraction was approximately 100 units/ml. The RNA substrate was radioactively labeled as indicated. Reaction volume was 15 or 25 μl, and incubations were performed at 30 °C.

SDS-polyacrylamide (acrylamide:bisacrylamide 30:08) gels (5 and 7.5% acrylamide in spacer and separation gels, respectively) were prepared according to Laemmli (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) using a Mini-Protean II gel apparatus (Bio-Rad, 125BR). The indicated amount of protein was fractionated directly on the gel or precipitated before loading by the addition of 1 volume of 20% trichloroacetic acid followed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. The obtained pellet was dried, washed with acetone, collected again by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 × g, and finally dissolved in 10 μl of sample buffer (50 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% (w/v) SDS, 100 mm dithiothreitol, 8% (v/v) glycerol, 0.025% (w/v) bromphenol blue), and separated by gel electrophoresis. The resulting gel was fixed and stained as indicated. Silver staining was according to Oakley et al. (32Oakley B.R. Kirsch D.R. Morris R. Anal.

Methods Enzymol. 1990; 182: 477-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Elution of proteins from SDS-polyacrylamide gel and renaturation of nuclease activity was done as described by Hager and Burgess (34Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Anal.

Wittman-Liebold B. Protein Structure Analysis: Preparation, Characterization, and Microsequencing. Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg1997: 97-104Crossref Google Scholar). In brief, after washing with ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile, the gel piece was completely dried, and a solution containing modified porcine trypsin, sequence grade (Promega Corp. Madison, WI) was allowed to soak into the gel piece. After overnight incubation at 30 °C, generated peptides were recovered by extraction. The peptide mixture was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry, using a Bruker Biflex III instrument (Bremen, Germany), equipped with delayed extraction and reflector. The sample was prepared by the dried droplet technique, using a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid as matrix. The instrument was externally calibrated using angiotensin II (MH+ 1046.54) and adrenocorticotropic hormone fragment 18-39 (MH+ 2465.20). The peptide mass fingerprinting analysis was done using ProFound (version 4.7.5). The 74-kDa PARN polypeptide and a 54-kDa fragment of PARN were molecularly cloned by a standard reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction procedure followed by subcloning into the pGem T vector (Promega Inc.). Inserts were subcloned into the pET-19 vector (Novagen Inc.) between the NdeI and BamHI sites. The following primer pairs were used 5′-TCGCATATGGAGATAATCAGGAGCA-3′ and 5′-TCAGATCTTTACCATGTGTCAGGAACTTCA-3′ for the 74-kDa PARN polypeptide and 5′-TCGCATATGGAGATAATCAGGAGCA-3′ and CGTGGATCCTCAGTTACCAAAGGCACTGAA for the 54-kDa fragment.

A global multiexponential analysis of time-resolved optical spectra in the blue region shows the following three kinetic components: 1) a 3-ms lifetime in the absence of methyl viologen that represents charge recombination between P700+ and an FeS− cluster; 2) a 750-μs lifetime that represents electron donation from an FeS−cluster to methyl viologen; and 3) an ∼15-μs lifetime that represents an electrochromic shift of a carotenoid pigment. Room temperature direct detection transient EPR studies of forward electron transfer show a spectrum of P700+ Q− during the lifetime of the spin polarization and give no evidence of a significant population of P700+ FeS− for t ≤ 2–3 μs. The UV difference spectrum measured 5 μs after a flash shows a maximum at 315 nm, a crossover at 280 nm, and a minimum at 255 nm as well as a shoulder at 290–295 nm, all of which are characteristic of the plastoquinone-9 anion radical. Kinetic measurements that monitor Q at 315 nm show a major phase of forward electron transfer to the FeS clusters with a lifetime of ∼15 μs, which matches the electrochromic shift at 485 nm of the carotenoid, as well as an minor phase with a lifetime of ∼250 μs. Electrometric measurements show similar biphasic kinetics. The slower kinetic phase can be detected using time-resolved EPR spectroscopy and has a spectrum characteristic of a semiquinone anion radical. We estimate the redox potential of plastoquinone-9 in the A1site to be more oxidizing than phylloquinone so that electron transfer from Q− to FX is thermodynamically unfavorable in the menA and menB mutants.

In two previous papers, we described the construction and physiology of phylloquinone biosynthetic mutants in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (1Johnson T.W. Shen G. Zybailov B. Kolling D. Reategui R. Beauparlant S. Vassiliev I.R. Bryant D.A. Jones A.D. Golbeck J.H. Chitnis P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8523-8530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), and we reported EPR and electron nuclear double resonance studies that implied the presence of a foreign quinone, termed Q, in the A1 site of PS I (2Zybailov B. van der Est A. Zech S.G. Teutloff C. Johnson W.T. Shen G. Bittl R. Stehlik D. Chitnis P. Golbeck J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8531-8539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). To summarize briefly, the interruption of the menA and menB genes, which code for dihydroxynaphthoic acid synthase and phytyltransferase, respectively, results in the termination of phylloquinone biosynthesis as judged by high pressure liquid chromatography/mass spectroscopy (HPLC/MS) and gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy of pigment extracts from isolated PS I complexes. However, the menA and menB mutant strains grow photoautotrophically under low light intensities, and isolated PS I complexes are capable of sustaining high rates of steady-state electron transfer from cytochrome c 6 to flavodoxin. HPLC and HPLC/MS studies show that quantitative amounts of plastoquinone-9 are present in PS I complexes isolated from the menA and menB mutants, whereas plastoquinone-9 is present only in vanishingly small amounts in PS I complexes isolated from the wild type. EPR studies indicate that Q− has a considerably larger g anisotropy than the native phylloquinone, consistent with the presence of a 1-ring benzoquinone rather than a 2-ring menaquinone. In addition, the prominent hyperfine splittings due to the 2-methyl group in phylloquinone are absent in the CW and transient EPR spectrum of Q−. Spin-echo and transient EPR studies show that Q− is located at the same distance from P700+, and with the same orientation with respect to the membrane, as phylloquinone in the wild type. Pulsed electron nuclear double resonance studies additionally show features that arise from nearly axially symmetric hyperfine couplings tentatively assigned to two methyl groups on Q. These results indicate that in the absence of phylloquinone PS I recruits plastoquinone-9 into the A1site of the menA and menB mutants and that plastoquinone-9 functions as an efficient electron cofactor from A0− to the FeS clusters. The premise of the present study is that since plastoquinone-9 and phylloquinone have different one-electron reduction potentials in dimethylformamide, they likely possess different reduction potentials and hence different kinetic properties in the A1 site. The kinetics of forward electron transfer from A1− to the FeS clusters in wild-type PS I have been well documented using transient EPR spectroscopy and time-resolved UV spectroscopy. Both methods are consistent in showing a forward electron transfer time of ∼280 ns in spinach and cyanobacterial PS I complexes (3Bock C.H. Van der Est A.J. Brettel K. Stehlik D. FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 91-96Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 4van der Est A. Bock C. Golbeck J. Brettel K. Sétif P. Stehlik D.

Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7846-7854Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Photovoltage measurements of oriented cyanobacterial PS I complexes reveal an electrogenic phase with a similar forward electron transfer time that was ascribed the A1− to FX transition (7Leibl W. Toupance B. Breton J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 10237-10244Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Optical studies reveal an additional component with a forward electron transfer time of ∼10 ns in detergent-treated samples but not in whole cells (5Brettel K. FEBS Lett. 1988; 239: 93-98Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). In the absence of detergent, the fast phase represents only 30% of the total contribution, leading to the speculation that in the native membranes the forward transfer time is the same in spinach and cyanobacteria. This third paper in the menA/menB series focuses on the kinetics of electron transfer in PS I complexes from the menA and menB mutants of Synechocystissp. PCC 6803. Since electron transfer rates are sensitive to changes in Gibbs free energy as well as to alterations in distances and reorganization energies among donor and acceptor pairs, the replacement of phylloquinone would be expected to translate to a change in the rate of electron transfer through A1. The analysis is simplified by the findings that the orientation of Q− and the distance between Q− and P700+ in the mutants are the same as for phylloquinone in the wild type (2Zybailov B. van der Est A. Zech S.G. Teutloff C. Johnson W.T. Shen G. Bittl R. Stehlik D. Chitnis P. Golbeck J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8531-8539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Similarly, the reorganization energy is not expected to differ significantly given that the replacement quinones are structural analogs of phylloquinone. We find that the rate of forward electron transfer from Q−to FX is slowed by a factor of ∼100–1000 compared with the wild type. The forward electron transfer kinetics allows us to measure a light-induced difference spectrum of Q- minusQ in the UV. Based on the behavior of plastoquinone-9 and phylloquinone in organic solvents, and based on rate versus free energy relationships derived from electron transfer theory, we estimate the redox potential of plastoquinone-9 in the A1 site. Optical absorbance changes in the near IR were measured using a laboratory-built spectrophotometer (8Vassiliev I.R. Jung Y.S. Mamedov M.D. Semenov A.Y. Golbeck J.H. Biophys.

To ensure resolution of kinetics in the microseconds time domain, a high frequency roll-off amplifier described in the original specifications was not used, and the signal was fed directly into the plug-in (11A33 differential comparator, 100-MHz bandwidth) of the Tektronix DSA601 oscilloscope. The sample cuvette contained the PS I trimers isolated from the menA or menB mutants at 50 μg/ml Chl in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 10 mm sodium ascorbate, 4 μm DCPIP, and 0.04%n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside (β-DM). Optical absorbance changes in the visible region were measured using a laboratory-built spectrometer consisting of a 400-watt tungsten-halogen source (Oriel), a ¼-meter monochromator (Jarrell Ash model 82-410) prior to the sample cuvette (to select a measuring wavelength), a sample compartment for a 1 × 1-cm fluorescence (4-sided clear) cuvette, a second ¼-meter monochromator (Jarrell Ash model 82-410) after the sample cuvette (to reject the flash and fluorescence artifacts), and a PIN-10 photodiode detector (United Detector Technology). Suitable lenses were placed to focus the light on the monochromator slits and to provide a collimated beam through the sample cuvette. The photocurrent was converted to a voltage with a 30,000-ohm resistor; the voltage was amplified using a model 100 amplifier (EG & G) set to a DC bandwidth of 100 kHz, and the signal was digitized using a Model 4094A digital oscilloscope (Nicolet Instruments, Madison, WI) interfaced via an IEEE-488 bus using a GPIB-TNT board (National Instruments, Austin, TX) in a Power Macintosh 7100/88 computer. The data were transferred to the computer and stored as binary files using LabView 4.1 (National Instruments, Austin, TX) and further processed in Igor Pro 3.14 (Wavemetrics, Inc., Lake Oswego, OR). Actinic flashes were supplied using a frequency-doubled Nd-YAG laser (Spectra Physics) operating at 532 nm at a flash energy of 1.4 mJ. Each kinetic trace represents 16 averages within the digital oscilloscope. The sample cuvette (10 × 10-mm) contained 3.0 ml of PS I complex at 10 μg/ml Chl suspended in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.3 with 0.04% β-DM, 10 mm sodium ascorbate, and 4 μmDCPIP. Optical studies in the UV (240–340 nm) were conducted using a pulse-probe spectrometer described in Ref. 9Diner B.A. Mcintosh L. Photosynthesis: Molecular Biology of Energy Capture. 360. Academic Press Inc., San Diego1998: 337-360Google Scholar. The monochromator slit was fixed at 4 mm, equivalent to a bandwidth of 8 nm. Measurements in the UV were performed using a xenon flashlamp as the actinic source filtered by a Schott and a Kodak Wratten 34. The photodiodes were protected with Corion Solar Blind UV-transmitting filters. The optical path length of the sample cuvette was 1 cm. Each data point represents the average of eight measurements, taken with a flash spacing of 20 s to allow complete reduction of P700+ by the external donor. A background measurement was taken similarly except that the sample was shielded from the detecting flash to allow for correction of the actinic flash artifact. The absorbance change shown represents the difference between the two measurements. The sample cuvette contained the PS I trimers isolated from the menB mutant at 10 μg/ml Chl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 10 μm sodium ascorbate, 4 μm DCPIP, and 0.03% β-DM. EPR spectral changes shown in Fig. 1 B were measured using a Bruker ESP 300E spectrometer equipped with a TM110 cylindrical resonator (Bruker ER4103). A frequency-doubled Nd-YAG laser (Spectra Physics DCL) provided the excitation flash at a wavelength of 532 nm and at an energy of 14 mJ. The computer was configured to capture and average the data and to flash the laser at 10-s intervals. The data represent an average of 64 flashes. The flat cell (Wilmad WG-813-Q) contained the PS I trimers isolated from the menA or menB mutants at 400 μg/ml Chl, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 10 mm sodium ascorbate, 4 μm DCPIP, and 0.03% β-DM. Room temperature-transient EPR experiments were carried out using a setup described in detail elsewhere (10van der Est A. Hager-Braun C. Leibl W. Hauska G. Stehlik D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1409: 87-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The samples were pumped continuously through a flat cell mounted in a Varian rectangular resonator equipped with a rough-surfaced glass window that scatters the laser light to provide a more even distribution of light intensity in the cell. Time/magnetic field data sets were collected using direct detection by measuring light-induced transients at fixed magnetic field positions over an appropriate spectral region. Decay-associated spectra were then generated by fitting the transients with a kinetic function and plotting the amplitude(s) against the magnetic field as discussed (3Bock C.H. Van der Est A.J. Brettel K. Stehlik D. FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 91-96Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 4van der Est A. Bock C. Golbeck J. Brettel K. Sétif P. Stehlik D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11789-11797Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The same setup and conditions were also used to collect time/field data sets shown in Fig. 7 but with field modulation and lock-in detection. By using direct detection, the decay of the spin polarization limits the accessible time range to times shorter than a few microseconds. By using field modulation, the spectrometer has a rise time of ∼50 μs but a much higher sensitivity so that slow forward electron transfer and charge recombination can be monitored. Measurements of transmembrane electric potential difference generation by PS I-containing proteoliposomes adsorbed onto the surface of azolectin-impregnated collodion film were done at room temperature as described elsewhere (11Mamedov M.D. Gadzhieva R.M. Gourovskaya K.N. Drachev L.A. Semenov A.Y. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1996; 28: 517-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The instrument rise-time was 200 ns. Saturating light flashes were provided by a frequency-doubled Quantel Nd:YAG laser (λ = 532 nm; pulse half-width, 15 ns; flash energy, 20 mJ). The multiexponential fits of optical and EPR kinetics were performed by the Marquardt algorithm in Igor Pro version 3.14 (Wavemetrics Inc., Lake Oswego, OR) on a G3/300 Macintosh computer. For global analysis of kinetics in the visible region (Fig. 2), individual kinetics were analyzed first assuming the presence of either three components or two components and a base line. The results of these analyses were then used for fitting the whole set of data to global lifetimes, and the best solution was chosen based on the analysis of χ2, standard errors of the parameters, and the residuals of the fits. In PS I trimers isolated from the wild type with β-DM, the reduction of P700+ is multiphasic after a saturating flash (8Vassiliev I.R. Jung Y.S. Mamedov M.D. Semenov A.Y. Golbeck J.H. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 301-315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). When measured by optical spectroscopy in the near-IR and in the absence of external electron acceptors, the majority of P700+ is reduced with lifetimes of ∼86 and 12 ms in an ∼10:1 ratio (minor microsecond kinetic phases are present due to back reactions from earlier acceptors in damaged reaction centers). There also exists a long lived kinetic phase of P700+ reduction due to direct reduction of P700+ by reduced DCPIP that represents ∼20% of the total absorbance change. In PS I trimers isolated from the menB mutant, the reduction of P700+ is also multiphasic after a saturating flash (Fig.1 A). When measured in the absence of external electron acceptors, P700+ is reduced with lifetimes of ∼2.6 and 7 ms in a 0.63:0.37 ratio (minor microsecond kinetic phases are similarly present due to back reactions from earlier acceptors in damaged reaction centers). There also exists a minor long lived kinetic phase of P700+ reduction due to direct reduction of P700+ by reduced DCPIP that represents 7% of the total absorbance change. The menA mutant showed nearly identical kinetics (data not shown). When measured in the same reaction medium using time-resolved EPR spectroscopy with field modulation detection (Fig. 1 B), the majority of P700+ in the menB mutant is reduced with a lifetime of 3.2 ms, a value in good agreement with the optical study. Since the signal-to-noise limits the precision of these measurements, the single kinetic phase found in the EPR measurement may correspond to a convolution of the 2.6- and 7-ms lifetimes found in the optical experiment. The EPR study also shows a long lived kinetic phase of P700+ reduction that corresponds to ∼13% of the total spin concentration. The menA mutant showed similar kinetics (data not shown). If we consider only the 3.2-ms kinetic phase, then the charge recombination of the electron acceptor(s) with P700+ is ∼25 times faster in the menA and menB mutants than in the wild type. Fig. 2 A depicts spectra obtained in the blue region by global multiexponential analysis of kinetics in the absence of methyl viologen in PS I complexes from the menB mutant. Three discrete kinetic components are present. The component fitted to the slowest kinetic phase approximated by a base line (checked boxes) corresponds to the spectrum (P700+ minus P700) and represents a population of P700+ reduced by the external electron donor, DCPIP. In these reaction centers, the electron has already escaped from FeS− to an external acceptor, probably molecular oxygen. The 3.2-ms kinetic phase (solid squares) corresponds to the spectrum of (P700+ FeS− minus P700 FeS) and represents a close match to the kinetics of P700+relaxation measured optically and by EPR (Fig. 1, A and B). The fastest kinetic phase is the 13-μs kinetic event (solid circles), which will be discussed in detail later. Fig. 2 B depicts spectra obtained by global multiexponential analysis of kinetics in the presence of methyl viologen. Three discrete kinetic components are also present. The component fitted to the slowest kinetic phase (open squares) corresponds to the spectrum of (P700+ minus P700), and it represents the entire population of P700+ reduced by the external electron donor, DCPIP. The spectrum of the 18-μs component (open circles) resembles that of the 13-μs component in the absence of methyl viologen (this component will be discussed later). An additional third component, with a lifetime of 744 μs (solid diamonds), is present with a broad bleaching from 400 to 500 nm characteristic of an S → Fe charge-transfer transition and corresponds to the spectrum of FeS− minus FeS. It is not possible to identify unambiguously the FeS cluster giving rise to this absorbance change because the oxidized minus reduced difference spectra of FX, FB, and FA are nearly identical. However, the electron is likely in equilibrium between FAand FB, and the kinetics likely represents the forward electron donation from the terminal electron acceptor FB− to methyl viologen. The larger absorbance change of the 3.2-ms phase in the absence of methyl viologen (Fig. 2 A) compared with the slow phase in the presence of methyl viologen (Fig. 2 B) is derived from the additional contribution of a reduced electron acceptor. Assuming that the spectrum of the 3.2-ms component in the absence of methyl viologen corresponds to the absorbance changes brought about by P700+ plus a reduced acceptor, whereas the spectrum of the slow kinetic component in the presence of methyl viologen corresponds to the absorbance changes of P700+ alone, the difference will correspond to the spectrum of the reduced acceptor. The resulting spectrum, presented in Fig. 2 C, is similar to that of the 744-μs kinetic phase in the presence of methyl viologen (Fig.2 B, solid diamonds), showing a broad bleaching from 400 to 500 nm characteristic of an S → Fe charge-transfer transition. (The amplitude of the absorbance change is lower than in Fig. 2 B (solid diamonds) because a fraction of the reaction centers has already lost the electron from the FeS− clusters.) The electron that back-reacts with P700+ with a 3.2-ms lifetime is therefore located in a FeS cluster, although for reasons mentioned above, it is not possible to differentiate between FB and FA. The menA mutant showed similar results (data not shown). An attempt was made to measure the forward electron transfer from Q− to the FeS clusters in the menA and menB mutants by accumulating time/field transient EPR data sets at 9 GHz (X-band) in PS I complexes isolated with β-DM. Fig. 3shows spectra extracted from the data sets by fitting the individual transients as described in Ref. 4van der Est A. Bock C. Golbeck J. Brettel K. Sétif P. Stehlik D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11789-11797Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar. Fig. 4shows selected transients corresponding to the field position marked by the arrow in Fig. 3. For the wild-type sample (Fig. 3,top, and Fig. 4, top), the onset of the laser flash results in the appearance of an E/A/E polarization pattern within the rise time of the spectrometer due to the generation of the spin-polarized radical pair P700+A1− (3Bock C.H. Van der Est A.J. Brettel K. Stehlik D. FEBS Lett. 1989; 247: 91-96Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 4van der Est A. Bock C. Golbeck J. Brettel K. Sétif P. Stehlik D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11789-11797Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). At the field position chosen for the transients in Fig. 3, this radical pair gives the absorptive contribution to the top trace. This spectrum decays with a time constant of ∼280 ns to the emissive spectrum due to P700+ FeS− shown in Fig. 3, top. In the corresponding transient in Fig. 4 (top), the electron transfer results in a transition from an absorptive contribution at early time to an emissive contribution at later times. We have shown that in samples devoid of FA and FB, the late signal is retained indicating that the electron transfer proceeds via FX (4van der Est A. Bock C. Golbeck J. Brettel K. Sétif P. Stehlik D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 11789-11797Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, it is not possible to identify unambiguously the FeS cluster involved in the radical pair giving the emissive spectrum in intact samples because its contribution is spread over a large spectral range and because of fast relaxation at room temperature (see Ref. 12Kandrashkin Y.E. Salikhov K. van der Est A. Stehlik D. Appl. Magn. Res. 1998; 15: 417-447Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar for discussion). The subsequent decay of the emissive spectrum with a time constant of 1.5 μs represents the relaxation of the spin-polarized signal. This represents the limit on the time resolution of the spin polarization method.Figure 4Electron spin-polarized EPR kinetic transients of the wild-type, menA, and menBmutants. Kinetic traces corresponding to the spectra shown in Fig. 3 taken at the field position indicated by the arrowat the bottom of Fig. 3. Top trace, native PS I.Middle trace, PS I from menA. Bottom trace, PS I from menB. The electron transfer from A1− to FeS is clearly visible in the upper trace. Note, however, that the decay of the signals is dominated by the relaxation of the spin polarization and not by recombination of the radical pairs involved.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) For the menA (Figs. 3, middle, and 4,middle) and menB (Figs. 3, bottom, and4, bottom) mutants, the onset of the laser flash results in the appearance of a spectrum that we assign to the state P700+ Q−, where Q is tentatively identified as plastoquinone-9 in the A1 site. This spectrum does not show any indication of singlet-triplet mixing in the precursor state, and its rise time is governed by the response time of the spectrometer. Thus, we conclude that electron transfer to Q occurs on a time scale of less than ∼0.5 ns. Compared with the wild type, the spectrum of P700+ Q− decays more slowly than that of P700+ A1−, and there is no indication of P700+ FeS− during the 1.5-μs decay of the spin polarization pattern. Thus, we can place a conservative lower limit on the lifetime of P700+Q− at 2–3 μs. This result indicates that electron transfer from A1− to FXis slowed by a factor of at least 10, from ∼280 ns in the wild type to ≥ 2–3 μs in the menA and menBmutants; one kinetic phase will be shown to be ∼300 μs when measured directly in the field modulation transient EPR experiment described later. We found it possible to measure accurately forward electron transfer from Q− to the FeS clusters in the UV using a flash-detection, pump-probe spectrophotometer (13Joliot P. Béal D. Frilley B. J. Chim. Phys. 1980; 77: 209-259Crossref Google Scholar). Absorption changes were determined in the menA mutant from 245 to 330 nm at time points 5 μs, 100 μs, and 5 ms after an actinic flash. The light-minus-dark difference spectrum recorded 5 μs after the flash shows a maximum at 310 nm, a cross-over at 280 nm, and a minimum of 255 nm, as well as a shoulder at 290–295 nm (Fig.5 A, circles). The difference spectra at 100 μs (Fig. 5 A, squares) and 5 ms (Fig.5 A, triangles) after the flash resemble the spectrum at 5 μs, implying that all kinetic phases are derived from the same species. This spectrum is strikingly similar to the plastosemiquinone-9 anion radical minus plastoquinone-9 difference spectrum in methanol (Fig. 5 B, checked circles), which shows a maximum at 315 nm, a crossover at 280 nm, and a minimum of 255 nm as well as a shoulder at 280–300 nm (14Benasson R. Land E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 325: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The reader should note that the absolute value of the absorbance change of the trough on the short wavelength (blue) side is larger than the absolute value of the absorbance change of the peak on the long wavelength side in both the Q−/Q (Fig. 5 A, circles) and the plastoquinone anion radical minus plastoquinone-9 (Fig. 5 B, checked circles) difference spectra. The spectrum of Q−/Q is also strikingly similar to the QA- minus QAdifference spectrum in deoxycholate-isolated PS II particles (15van Gorkom H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1974; 347: 439-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), except that the latter is shifted to the red about 15 nm (Fig.5 B, checked squares). It is noteworthy that the spectrum in Fig. 5 A does not resemble that of wild-type PS I, in which the flash-induced difference spectrum (with phylloquinone in the A1 site) shows a peak centered at 380 nm and a crossover of ∼325 nm (5Brettel K. FEBS Lett. 1988; 239: 93-98Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It is also interesting that the Q−/Q difference spectrum differs from the PQH/PQ difference spectrum, in which the peak occurs at 295 nm, and in which the absolute value of the extinction coefficient at 250 nm is over twice that at 300 nm (14Benasson R. Land E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 325: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This indicates that the plastoquinone radical in the A1site remains unprotonated during its measured lifetime. The light-minus-dark difference spectrum of Q−/Q therefore supports the assignment of Q as plastoquinone-9 in the A1site (1Johnson T.W. Shen G. Zybailov B. Kolling D. Reategui R. Beauparlant S.

The fact that increasing the G-quartet stem length from 15 to 24 Å kept inhibition of HIV-1 IN activity unchanged suggests that the binding interaction occurs between a GTGT loop domain of the G-quartet inhibitors and a catalytic site of HIV-1 IN, referred to as a face-to-face interaction.

The analyses have been performed on the oligonucleotide 5′-G*TGGTGGGTGGGTGGG*T, synthesized with a phosphorothioate linkage at the two end G residues (G*) and referred to as T30177. This G-rich oligonucleotide is capable of forming a stable intramolecular G-quartet fold (6.Rando R.F. Ojwang J. Elbaggari A. Reyes G.R. Tinder R. McGrath M.S. Hogan M.E. J. Biol.

IC50(50% inhibitory concentration) values of T30177 for HIV-1 IN are in the nanomolar range in vitro (7.Mazumder A. Neamati N. Ojwang J.O. Sunder S. Rando R.F. Pommier Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13762-13771Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A 16-residue oligonucleotide (5′-G*GGTGGGTGGGTGGG*T) referred to as T30695 has been designed and synthesized to improve both the structural stability and inhibition of HIV-1 IN activity (8.Jing N. Rando R.F. Pommier Y. Hogan M.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12498-12505Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Compared with T30177, T30695 forms an even more stable and orderly G-quartet fold. Our NMR and kinetic data demonstrated that in response to K+ binding, T30695 folds into a stable and symmetric G-tetrad complex (8.Jing N. Rando R.F. Pommier Y. Hogan M.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12498-12505Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 9.Jing N. Gao X. Rando R.F. Hogan M.E. J. Biomol. Struct.

The folding is a two-step process, dependent on the nature of the alkaline metal ion. The first step of the process involves the coordination of one K+ ion, which competes with a Li+ ion to bind within the core of two G-quartets. The second step involves the binding of two additional K+ ions to the loop domains. NMR results have shown that in the absence of K+, T30695 forms an intramolecular fold with a pair of distorted G-quartets flanked by extended, unfolded loop domains (called the Li+ form). When coordinated with 3 K+ eq, T30695 folds into a more compact and symmetric structure with an ∼15-Å width and a 15-Å length (called the K+ form). This structure resembles a cylinder with positive charges inside and negative charges on the outer surface (10.Jing N. Hogan M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34992-34999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The IC50 of T30695 for inhibition of HIV-1 IN without K+ (Li+ form structure) is 530 nm. In the presence of K+, the IC50 of T30695(K+ form structure) decreases from 530 to 31 nm, corresponding to a 20-fold increase in the inhibition of HIV-1 IN activity. Kinetic data demonstrated that this increase in inhibition of HIV-1 IN activity for T30695 is correlated with the folding of its loops into a stable, compact structure by the binding of 2 additional K+ eq. The loop structures of T30695 appear to play a key role in the inhibition of HIV-1 IN activity. To investigate the binding interaction between the catalytic site of HIV-1 IN and the G-quartet inhibitors, we have designed G-tetrad-forming oligonucleotides with two, three, and four G-quartets. The lengths of these G-quartet stems are 15, 19, and 24 Å, respectively. The results demonstrated that these G-tetrad-forming oligonucleotides with different stem lengths have the same ability to inhibit HIV-1 IN activity in vitro. Based upon the experimental evidence and modeling study, we provide some critical information regarding the interaction and structure-activity between HIV-1 IN and the G-quartet inhibitors, which could be of benefit in the design of novel anti-HIV therapeutic drugs. All of the G-rich oligonucleotides were obtained from Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX). These oligonucleotides were synthesized using cyanothyl phosphoramidite chemistry. After removal of the protecting groups by hydrolysis with concentrated ammonium hydroxide, the products were purified by anion-exchange high pressure liquid chromatography. The qualities of materials were then measured by mass spectroscopy. We used these oligonucleotides without further treatments. Oligonucleotides at 5 μm strand equivalents (20 mmLi3PO4, pH 7) were heated to 90 °C for 5 min and then cooled at 4 °C for 30 min in the presence of KCl at a designated concentration. Subsequent to the incubation step, thermal denaturation profiles of the oligonucleotides were obtained over a range from 20 to 90 °C for melting and from 90 to 20 °C for annealing. Absorbance was monitored at 240 nm by a Hewlett-Packard 8452A diode array spectrophotometer using a Hewlett-Packard 89090A temperature regulator. The thermal denaturation curves of the oligonucleotides were analyzed with an intramolecular folding equilibrium (8.Jing N. Rando R.F. Pommier Y. Hogan M.E.

In our analysis study, the values of ς are in the range of 0.9–0.999, determined by an optimized fitting program. Values forT m and ΔG were obtained on the basis of the fitting procedure, which inputs the values of ΔH 0, ΔS 0,A rc, and A st, estimated from the experimental measurements, and then uses an optimized fitting program to search for the best fit. The G-rich oligonucleotides, T30695 and its derivatives, plus 10 mm KCl in 20 mmLi3PO4, pH 7, were labeled with 32P using a 5′-end labeling procedure and purified using Microspin G-25 columns. The oligonucleotide solution was heated at 90 °C for 5 min and then cooled at 4 °C for 30 min. 20% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels containing 1× Tris/borate acid/EDTA buffer, 10% ammonium persulfate, and 30 μl of TEMED in 1× TBA buffer were precooled in a 4 °C cold room for 1 h. The prepared samples were run on 20% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in a 4 °C cold room for 6 h. Gels were stained in a 0.01% Stains-All/formamide solution. CD spectra of the G-quartet oligonucleotides were obtained in 15 μm strand concentration plus 10 mm KCl in 20 mmLi3PO4, at pH 7, on a Jasco J-500A spectropolarimeter at 24 °C. Each spectrum represents five average scans. Data are presented in molar ellipticity (degrees·cm2·dmol−1). The pET-15b-IN-(1–288)/F185K/C280S plasmid was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21 as described previously (12.Jenkins T.M. Engelman A. Ghirlando R. Cragie R. J. Biol.

Cells were grown in 1000 ml of LB medium (Digene, Beltsville, MD) containing 5 μg/ml ampicillin until an optical density of 0.8 was reached at 600 nm. Protein expression was induced for 3 h with the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cells were harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 5 mmimidazole, 2 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.3 mg/ml lysozyme. After 30 min on ice and sonication, lysed cells were centrifuged for 20 min at 30,000 × g, and the supernatant was applied to a nickel-Sepharose column. Integrase retained on the column was washed with buffer containing 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and an increasing imidazole concentration from 20 to 250 mm. The protein was then eluted with the same buffer containing 750 mm imidazole and dialyzed overnight against 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl, 2 mmEDTA, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 100 mm imidazole, and 10% glycerol. The HIV-1 IN assays were performed as described previously (7.Mazumder A. Neamati N. Ojwang J.O. Sunder S. Rando R.F. Pommier Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13762-13771Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. In the 3′-processing and strand transfer assay, HIV-1 IN was preincubated at a final concentration of 400 nm with inhibitors for 15 min at 30 °C in a reaction buffer containing 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mm NaCl, 7.5 mmMnCl2, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 14.3 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Then, a 5 nmconcentration of the 32P-5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide was added to a final volume of 10 μl, and incubation was continued for an additional 30 min. Reactions were quenched by addition of 5 μl of denaturing loading dye. Samples were loaded on a 20% (19:1) denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The molecular structures of T40215 andT40216 were built up and optimized under AMBER force field by INSIGHT II/DISCOVER. The optimization of the molecular structures followed this procedure: 1) 100 steps of conjugate gradient energy minimization; 2) 1000 steps of restrained molecular dynamics equilibration with a time step of 0.33 fs at 1000 K; 3) 1000 steps of restrained molecular dynamics equilibration with a time step of 0.1 fs at 300 K; and 4) 1000 steps of conjugate gradient energy minimization. The intramolecular hydrogen bonds of G-quartets were used as constrains for the molecular optimization. The molecular structure of the core domain of HIV-1 IN, HIV-1 IN-(51–209) (14.Maignan S. Guilloteau J.-P. Qing Z.-L. Clement-Mella C. Mikol V. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 282: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), was obtained from the Protein Data Bank. Next, we docked the NMR structure of T30695 (10.Jing N. Hogan M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34992-34999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) into this x-ray structure using the GRAMM docking program with a high resolution matching mode (15.Katchalski-Katzri E.

This program is based on a geometry-based algorithm for predicting the structure of a possible complex between molecules of known structures. It can provide quantitative data related to the quality of the contact between the molecules. The intermolecular energy calculation relies on the well established correlation and Fourier transformation techniques used in the field of pattern recognition. The docking calculation by GRAMM predicts the structure of the complex formed between the two constituent molecules by using their atomic coordination, without any prior information as to their binding sites. To eliminate the terminal effects of the structure of HIV-1 IN-(51–209) in the docking calculation, the docking range of the calculation was set up from amino acids 60 to 160. 1000 different structures of an HIV-1 IN·T30695 complex were created by the calculations. The information on the binding interaction and hydrogen bond formation of each docking structure was analyzed. Based upon the hydrogen bond formation, the statistical possibilities of the residues of T30695 interacting with HIV-1 IN and of the amino acid residues of HIV-1 IN binding T30695 were plotted. T30695 has been determined previously as an intramolecular G-quartet structure with two G-quartets in the center and two folded loop domains on the top and bottom (10.Jing N. Hogan M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34992-34999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Upon coordination with 3 K+ ion eq, the structure of T30695 becomes symmetric and compact with a 15-Å width and a 15-Å length. The distance between the two central G-quartet planes is ∼3.9 Å. Recently, T30695 and the thrombin-binding aptamer, which also forms an intramolecular G-quartet structure (19.Wang K.Y. McCurdy S. Shea S.G. Swaminathan S. Bolton P.H. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 1899-1904Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar, 20.Schultze P. Macaya R.F. Feigon J. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 235: 1532-1547Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), were further studied by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis (11.Jing N. De Clercq E. Rando R.F. Pallansh L. Lackman-Smith C. Lee S. Hogan M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3421-3430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Similar migration further confirmed that T30695 forms an intramolecular G-quartet structure with the same structural size as the thrombin-binding aptamer. T30923 (5′-GGGTGGGTGGGTGGGT) has the same sequence as T30695 (Fig. 1). However, the two terminal phosphorothioate linkages of T30695 in the G1and G15 positions are replaced by two phosphodiester linkages. We previously showed that T30923 has the same structure and physical properties as T30695 (11.Jing N. De Clercq E. Rando R.F. Pallansh L. Lackman-Smith C. Lee S. Hogan M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 3421-3430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). To investigate the interactions between HIV-1 IN and the G-quartet oligonucleotides, T40215 (5′-(GGGGT)4) and T40216(5′-(GGGGGT)4) were designed to form an intramolecular G-quartet structure, composed of three and four G-quartets with stem lengths of ∼19 and 24 Å, respectively (Fig. 1). CD spectra were employed to demonstrate that T30923, T40215, and T40216 form the same molecular structure as T30695. The CD spectra of T30695, T30923,T40215, and T40216 are characterized by nonconservative spectra, with maxima at 264 and 210 nm and minima at 240 nm (Fig.2), which demonstrated that all four oligonucleotides form the same G-quartet structure. Compared with the CD spectrum of T30695, it appears that a longer G-quartet stem corresponds to weaker CD ellipticity at 264 and 240 nm. Further evidence to support intramolecular G-quartet formation forT30923, T40215, and T40216 was obtained from nondenaturing gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3 A) and from melting and annealing measurements (Fig. 3 B and TableI). Fig. 3 A shows that the bands of T30923, T40215, and T40216 have the same migration compared with that of T30695. T30695 was used as a control since its molecular structure has been determined by NMR to form an intramolecular G-quartet structure in the presence of K+ (10.Jing N. Hogan M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34992-34999Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The migration rate on nondenaturing gels depends on the molecular structure of the G-quartet oligonucleotides. The same migration of all four G-quartet oligonucleotides demonstrates that they form the same molecular structure with a similar size. Therefore, T30923, T40215, andT40216 also form an intramolecular G-quartet structure in the presence of 10 mm KCl. However, electrophoresis cannot resolve the small difference in the length of these G-quartets from 15 to 24 Å.Table IMelting and annealing measurementsOligonucleotideHeatingT mHCoolingT mCΔT mΔT/T mH× 100%°C°C°C%T30923(5.0 μm)85.283.81.41.6T40215 (2.0 μm)72.772.700T40215 (5.0 μm)72.770.32.43.3T40215 (20.0 μm)72.767.94.86.6T40216 (5.0 μm)73.770.33.44.6Note that all T m values were measured in 5.0 mm KCl. Open table in a new tab Note that all T m values were measured in 5.0 mm KCl. A melting curve corresponds to a disordered state, called hyperchromicity. The annealing curve measures the base pairing and stacking of the secondary structure, called hypochromicity. The two curves (heating and cooling) of the same oligonucleotides are expected to be identical if the oligonucleotide forms an intramolecular, self-associated G-quartet. Compared with the meltingT mH (where “H” is heating) values in Table I, the annealing T mC (where “C” is cooling) values of all three oligonucleotides at 5 μm strand concentration have a slight shift to a lower temperature. The ΔT values of T30923, T40215, and T40216 are 1.4, 2.4, and 3.4 °C, respectively, showing that the molecules with longer G-quartet stems have greater ΔT values. Interestingly, the ΔT values of T40215 at strand concentrations of 2 and 20 μm are 0 and 4.8 °C, respectively, which suggests that ΔT may also depend on oligonucleotide concentration and that higher concentrations induce greater ΔT. At 2 μm, there was no measurable temperature shift (ΔT = 0) between the melting and annealing curves ofT40215, which provides evidence for an intramolecular G-quartet formation. The slight temperature shifts observed at 5 and 20 μm were considered to be induced by the disruption of structure refolding caused by higher molecular aggregation. The same phenomenon also applied when the G-quartet stem length was increased. The constant T mH values of T40215 from 2 to 20 μm (72.7 °C) also confirm that this oligonucleotide form an intramolecular G-quartet structure. T mdepends on the oligonucleotide concentration when a G-quartet structure is formed by dimeric or tetrameric oligonucleotides. Higher oligonucleotide concentrations increase the possibility of forming dimeric or tetrameric G-quartet structures, corresponding to higherT m. Only the T m of an intramolecular G-quartet structure is independent of the concentration of oligonucleotides. The conclusion obtained from these results is consistent with that from Fig. 3 A. The ion binding stoichiometry of the G-quartet structures has been established previously (8.Jing N. Rando R.F. Pommier Y. Hogan M.E. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 12498-12505Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). First, the thermal denaturation curves ofT30923, T40215, and T40216 in 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 mm KCl were obtained from UV absorbance at 240 nm and then analyzed using a single-strand denaturation equilibrium (see “Materials and Methods” for details). The fitting procedure is to input the constants ΔH 0, ΔS 0,A rc and A st, which were estimated from the experimental data, and then to use an optimizing program to search for the best fit. As shown in TableII, the fitting coefficient for each melting curve is ∼0.99 or higher. The slopes of the lines for T30923,T40215, and T40216 were 3.8, 5.1, and 6.5, respectively, obtained by fitting the data points of the calculated ΔG 0 versus log[K+] (Fig.4). Based upon Δn = ΔΔG 0/2.3RTΔlog10[K+] and k slope = ΔΔG 0/Δlog10[K+], the Δn K+ ion eq released from unfolding was calculated as 2.8, 3.8, and 4.8 for T30923, T40215, and T40216, respectively. NMR data previously confirmed that T30695 coordinates three K+ ions. One is bound between the two G-quartets, and two additional K+ ions are bonded between a G-quartet and a neighboring TGTG loop domain: one at the top and the other at the bottom (9.Jing N. Gao X. Rando R.F. Hogan M.E. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1997; 15: 573-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 10.Jing N. Hogan M.E. J. Biol.

The Δn values obtained here indicate thatT30923 also coordinates three K+ ions, whereas T40215 andT40216 coordinate four and five K+ ions between three and four G-quartets and two loop domains, respectively. These results confirm that T30923, T40215, and T40216 are composed of two, three, and four G-quartets, respectively, as shown in Fig.5.Table IIFitting coefficientsOligomerKClT mΔH 0ΔS 0ΔG 0 (T = 295)Fitting coefficientmm°Ckcal/molcal/K/molkcal/molT309230.163.6−109.55−325.49−13.530.996T309230.575.1−109.58−314.83−16.700.995T309231.080.6−112.73−318.8−18.680.993T309235.085.4−113.38−316.35−20.060.995T402150.147.7−46.47−144.90−3.730.994T402150.562.2−56.10−167.39−6.720.997T402151.068.4−74.86−219.27−10.170.997T402155.074.1−78.03−224.81−11.710.994T402160.149.8−47.62−147.5−4.100.994T402160.563.1−79.21−235.71−9.680.993T402161.069.2−88.33−258.10−12.190.993T402165.074.9−100.20288.00−15.230.978 Open table in a new tab Figure 5Molecular structures of , , and .

Neamati N. Ojwang J.O. Sunder S. Rando R.F. Pommier Y. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 13762-13771Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.6 A, T30923, T40215, and T40216were tested for the effect on both 3′-processing and strand transfer using a 21-mer duplex oligonucleotide. The 3′-processing reaction cleaves the 3′-terminal dinucleotide to a 19-mer oligonucleotide. The strand transfer reaction then results in an integration of two oligonucleotides together, which links the precleaved 3′-end of one 19-mer oligonucleotide to another 21-mer noncleaved or 19-mer precleaved oligonucleotide (Fig. 6 A). The strand transfer products yield larger molecular species with slower migration compared with the 21-mer substrate. The inhibition of HIV-1 IN activity byT30923, T40215, and T40216 is shown in Fig. 6 B. Compared with control lanes 2 and 21 (with only DNA plus integrase), the intensities of the 19-mer oligonucleotide band and of the strand transfer product bands decreased when the concentrations of T30923, T40215, and T40216 were increased. This result demonstrated that the G-quartet oligonucleotides blocked HIV-1 IN to yield the products of 3′-processing and strand transfer. IC50 values for inhibition of 3′-processing and strand transfer for T30923, T40215, and T40216 were obtained from plots of percentage inhibition versus drug concentration (Fig.6 C). IC50 values for T30923, T40215, and T40216were 70, 100, and 80 nm in 3′-processing and 85, 90, and 60 nm in strand transfer, respectively (TableIII).Table IIIIC50 values for 3′-processing and strand transferOligomerSequence (5′ → 3′)IC503′-ProcessingStrand transfernmT30923GGGTGGGTGGGTGGGT7085T40215(GGGGT)410090T40216(GGGGGT)48060 Open table in a new tab The results of the assay of anti-HIV IN activity demonstrated that all three G-quartet oligonucleotides had comparable ability to inhibit HIV-1 IN. However, based upon the structure determination (see above),T30923, T40215, and T40216 are composed of two, three, and four G-quartets with stem lengths of ∼15, 19, and 24 Å, respectively. The same range of IC50 values for the three oligonucleotides indicated that the increase in length of the G-quartet stem did not appear to disrupt the binding interaction between the catalytic sites of HIV-1 IN and the G-quartet oligonucleotides. Based on this observation, we propose that the binding interaction occurs between a catalytic site of HIV-1 IN and a GTGT loop domain of the G-quartet oligonucleotides, referred to as a face-to-face interaction. Previous NMR data have demonstrated that a GTGT loop domain of the G-tetrad-forming oligonucleotides folds into a plane when a K+ ion is bound between the loop domain and a neighbor G-quartet (8.Jing N.

The ETS domain factor Spi-1 (also called PU.1) and the bZIP factor NF-IL6 (also called C/EBPβ) have been shown to be involved in the transcriptional regulation of interleukin-1β gene (il1b) and other monocyte-specific genes. We now show that these two factors strongly cooperate on the il1b core promoter (−59/+12) in the absence of direct NF-IL6 binding to DNA. Transient transfection assays, using mutated il1b core promoters, showed that the Spi-1, but not the NF-IL6, binding site is absolutely required for functional cooperativity. Furthermore, the NF-IL6 transactivation domain (TAD) is functionally indispensable and more critical than that of Spi-1. Additionally, TAD-deficient NF-IL6 functions as a dominant negative for Spi-1-mediated activation, suggesting the involvement of the bZIP DNA binding domain. This is supported by the demonstration of in vitro interaction between the NF-IL6 bZIP and Spi-1 winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) DNA binding domains, arguing that NF-IL6 vigorously activates theil1b core promoter via protein-tethered transactivation mediated by Spi-1.

NF-IL6 is a bZIP transcription factor that belongs to the C/EBP family of proteins (1.Williams S.C. Cantwell C.A. Johnson P.F. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1553-1567Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 3.Thomassin H. Hamel D. Bernier D. Guertin M. Belanger L.

Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1146-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that NF-IL6 is capable of synergistically cooperating with other transcription factors, including NF-κB (8.Kunsch C. Lang R.K. Rosen C.A. Shannon M.F. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 153-164PubMed Google Scholar), Sp1 (9.Lee Y.H. Yano M. Liu S.Y. Matsunaga E. Johnson P.F. Gonzalez F.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1383-1394Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and GATA-1 (10.Yamaguchi Y. Nishio H. Kishi K. Ackerman S.J. Suda T. Blood. 1999; 94: 1429-1439Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In these cases, the binding of NF-IL6 and its partners to their recognition sites in the promoters is required for the functional cooperativity. A second factor, Spi-1/PU.1, is a winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) transcription factor that belongs to the ETS family of proteins. Spi-1 expression is primarily restricted to myeloid cells, whereas NF-IL6 is more broadly expressed. The importance of C/EBP factors and Spi-1 in myeloid cells emphasizes the need to understand the mechanisms regulating their functions. IL-1β is an important inflammatory and immunoregulatory cytokine expressed by primarily activated monocytes/macrophages in response to a variety of stimuli, including lipopolysaccharide, PMA, IL-1β, and other cytokines (11.Auron P.E. Webb A.C. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1994; 5: 573-592PubMed Google Scholar). Uncovering the mechanisms that drive the expression of il1b will elucidate the events of normal myeloid commitment and differentiation as well as the dysregulation of gene expression that leads to inflammatory diseases. Zhang and Rom (12.Zhang Y. Rom W.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3831-3837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) reported that the −131/+12 il1b promoter contained two NF-IL6 binding elements, located at positions −90/−82 and −41/−33. While the importance of the more upstream NF-IL6 site has been established (13.Kominato Y. Galson D. Waterman W.R. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 59-68Crossref Google Scholar), the function of the −41/−33 is poorly defined. This site overlaps the 3′-end of a Spi-1 binding site at −50/−39 by 3 base pairs. It was shown that in lipopolysaccharide-simulated macrophage cells, Spi-1, but not NF-IL6, is a predominant protein factor bound to this overlapping sequence (13.Kominato Y. Galson D. Waterman W.R. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 59-68Crossref Google Scholar, 14.Buras J.A. Monks B.G. Fenton M.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4444-4454PubMed Google Scholar) in the −59/+12 il1b core promoter. These data argue that the Spi-1, but not the overlapping NF-IL6 binding element, is required for maximal activation of theil1b core promoter. There are accumulating evidence showing that Spi-1 and C/EBP family factors are important for the regulation of many genes involved in immunity and hematopoiesis, such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (15.Petrovick M.S. Hiebert S.W. Friedman A.D. Hetherington C.J. Tenen D.G. Zhang D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3915-3925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and neutrophil elastase (16.Oelgeschlager M. Nuchprayoon I. Luscher B. Friedman A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4717-4725Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), in addition to the IL-1β gene. However, the mechanism responsible for the functional cooperativity is still poorly understood. Many ETS target sites are found adjacent to binding sites for other protein factors, which appear to functionally cooperate. The most frequently reported type of composite site involves cooperative interactions between ETS proteins and bZIP factors (17.Nagulapalli S. Pongubala J.M. Atchison M.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4330-4338PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Bassuk A.G. Leiden J.M. Immunity. 1995; 3: 223-237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), such as the interaction between the Spi-1 wHTH ETS DNA binding domain and the NF-IL6β (C/EBPδ) leucine zipper region (17.Nagulapalli S. Pongubala J.M. Atchison M.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4330-4338PubMed Google Scholar). In transient expression assays, using an artificial promoter containing adjacent Spi-1 and NF-IL6β sites, Nagulapalliet al. (17.Nagulapalli S. Pongubala J.M. Atchison M.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4330-4338PubMed Google Scholar) observed that Spi-1 and NF-IL6β could functionally cooperate to activate transcription. However, the combined roles of NF-IL6β and Spi-1 in naturally occurring promoters have not yet been reported. In most cases, the association of another factor with Spi-1 results in strong synergistic activation of target gene. A recent example is c-Jun, which acts as a Spi-1 coactivator on the promoters of myeloid genes coding for macrophage scavenger receptor (19.Moulton K.S. Semple K. Wu H. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4408-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), and macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (20.Behre G. Whitmarsh A.J. Coghlan M.P. Hoang T. Carpenter C.L. Zhang D.E. Davis R.J. Tenen D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 4939-4946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The close proximity of the Spi-1 and the putative NF-IL6 sites does not seem to be fortuitous. Even though the putative NF-IL6 site at positions −41/−33 seemed to not be critical as a transcription factor binding site, as suggested by Buras' in vitro data (14.Buras J.A. Monks B.G. Fenton M.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4444-4454PubMed Google Scholar), we still investigated the possible functional involvement of NF-IL6 in the regulation of the il1b core promoter. The study described here demonstrates that NF-IL6 strongly cooperates with Spi-1 to activate the il1b core promoter (−59/+12), in which the integrity of the Spi-1 binding site, but not the putative NF-IL6 binding site, is critical for the synergy. In addition, the functional cooperativity between Spi-1 and NF-IL6 definitely requires the transactivation domain (TAD) of NF-IL6, but not those of Spi-1. Spi-1 seems to act as an anchor, which tethers NF-IL6 to the il1bcore promoter to exert activation, without NF-IL6 binding to its cognate binding site. This mechanism, which we have called protein-tethered transactivation (PTT) (20.Behre G. Whitmarsh A.J. Coghlan M.P. Hoang T. Carpenter C.L. Zhang D.E. Davis R.J. Tenen D.G. J. Biol.

HeLa cells (Strain S3) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum and 0.5% penicillin-streptomycin as described previously (21.Wara-aswapati N.

The human il1b core promoter region (−59/+12) and its mutants were generated by polymerase chain reaction and inserted into pGL3-Basic vector (Promega) atMluI and BglII sites to construct promoter-reporter plasmids. The pRc/CMV plasmids expressing wild-type Spi-1 and a series of Spi-1 deletion mutants were constructed as described previously (21.Wara-aswapati N. Yang Z. Waterman W.R. Koyama Y. Tetradis S.

Expression vectors for the full-length NF-IL6 (pcDNA3.1-NF-IL6) and a truncated NF-IL6 with an internal deletion between the two SplI restriction sites (pcDNA1-NF-IL6ΔSpl) were constructed by inserting the NF-IL6 cDNAs (23.Tsukada J. Saito K. Waterman W.R. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7285-7297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) into expression vectors pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA1 (Invitrogen). GST fusion constructs containing various Spi-1 motifs were made as described previously (21.Wara-aswapati N. Yang Z. Waterman W.R. Koyama Y. Tetradis S. Choy B.K. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6803-6814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). GST-NF-IL6, GST-NF-IL6(Δspl), and GST-bZIP fusion protein expression vectors were constructed by inserting full-length, truncated ΔSpl NF-IL6 coding region, and a polymerase chain reaction-amplified fragment encoding the bZIP region of NF-IL6 from amino acids 269–345, into pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) atBamHI and EcoRI sites. HeLa S3 cells were plated in 24-well plates 24 h before transfection. A total of 1.8 μg plasmid DNA, including 0.5 μg of reporter, 0.5 μg of each expression vector, and 0.3 μg of pCMV·Sport-β-gal (Life Technologies, Inc.), except as noted, was transfected into the cells using DOTAP transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals GmbH) as described previously (21.Wara-aswapati N. Yang Z. Waterman W.R. Koyama Y. Tetradis S. Choy B.K. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6803-6814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation for 24 h, cells were stimulated with 50 ng/ml PMA (Sigma) for 20 h. The cells were then harvested and lysed in 150 μl of cell culture lysis reagent (Promega). The lysates were assayed for luciferase activity using the Promega luciferase assay kit. Glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were prepared by standard procedures as described previously (21.Wara-aswapati N. Yang Z. Waterman W.R. Koyama Y. Tetradis S. Choy B.K. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6803-6814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts of GST fusion proteins (as determined by Bio-Rad and confirmed by Coomassie Blue staining) were bound to 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads by incubation in a total volume of 500 μl of NETN (20 mm Tris chloride, pH 8.0, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40) (21.Wara-aswapati N.

The beads were washed three times in NETN buffer. The Sepharose beads bound with GST fusion protein were incubated with35S-labeled in vitro translated protein (TNT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system, Promega) at 4 °C for 1 h. The beads were washed five times in NETN buffer, and the bound proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min in SDS-PAGE loading buffer (50 mm Tris·Cl, pH 6.8, 30% glycerol, 0.4% SDS, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) containing β-mercaptoethanol. Proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (15% polyacrylamide gel), followed by soaking in Amplify fluorographic reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to Kodak X-Omat film. A sensitive method modified (21.Wara-aswapati N. Yang Z. Waterman W.R. Koyama Y. Tetradis S. Choy B.K. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6803-6814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) from a technique previously reported by Chittenden et al. (24.Chittenden T. Livingston D.M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Cell. 1991; 65: 1073-1082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) was used as to detect weak protein-DNA interaction. Briefly, equivalent amounts of GST fusion proteins were bound to 50 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads as described above. After washing with NETN buffer three times, the beads were resuspended in 200 μl of DNA probe binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 3 mmMgCl2, 33 ng/μl poly(dI-dC), 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and incubated for 5 min at 4 °C. The beads were then incubated for 20 min at 4 °C with 200,000 cpm of 32P-labeled wild-type probe corresponding to the il1b promoter sequence between −56 and −21 or the same probe with the putative NF-IL6 site mutated. The beads were washed twice with the binding buffer containing 10 ng/ml poly(dI-dC) and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Specific binding was assessed by Cerenkov counting of the protein-DNA complex on the glutathione-Sepharose beads. Double-stranded oligonucleotides spanning the overlapping Spi-1 and NF-IL6 sites (il1b promoter region from −56 to −21) were synthesized and labeled by using DNA polymerase Klenow fragment in the presence of [α-32P]dATP and [α-32P]dGTP. EMSAs were carried out by incubating 0.5 μl in vitro translated Spi-1 or NF-IL6 protein (TNT T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate system, Promega) with 10,000 cpm of the wild-type il1b probe, or the probe carrying mutations in either the Spi-1 site or the NF-IL6 site, under binding conditions of 10 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 3.3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a final volume of 15 μl. The binding reactions were performed on ice for 20 min and then subjected to electrophoresis on 4% nondenaturing low ionic strength polyacrylamide gels using 0.5 × TBE buffer (TBE, 45 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, and 1 mm EDTA). The gels were then dried and analyzed by autoradiography. We and others (12.Zhang Y. Rom W.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3831-3837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13.Kominato Y. Galson D. Waterman W.R. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 59-68Crossref Google Scholar, 14.Buras J.A. Monks B.G. Fenton M.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4444-4454PubMed Google Scholar) have previously reported that the −59/+12 il1b core promoter contains a Spi-1 (−50/−39) and an NF-IL6 (−41/−33) binding site. To verify that Spi-1 and NF-IL6 could transactivate the il1b core promoter, we performed transient cotransfection assays. A luciferase reporter plasmid containing the il1b core promoter was cotransfected into Spi-1-deficient HeLa S3 cells (25.Clark B.D. Fenton M.J. Rey H.L. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Powanda M.C. Oppenheim J.J. Kluger M.J. Denarello C. Monokines and Other Non-lymphocytic Cytokines. Alan R. Liss, New York1988: 47-53Google Scholar) along with plasmids either expressing Spi-1, NF-IL6, or both (Spi-1+NF-IL6). The cells were stimulated with PMA 20 h before luciferase assays to activate the NF-IL6 protein. As shown in Fig.1, NF-IL6 alone only had a minimal effect, whereas Spi-1 stimulated activity by about 20-fold. However, NF-IL6 together with Spi-1 activated the il1b core promoter by about 380-fold, suggesting a strong cooperativity between these two factors. To determine whether the cooperative activation of the il1b core promoter by Spi-1 and NF-IL6 depends on their binding sites, site-directed mutagenesis was used to introduce multiple nucleotide sequence substitutions into the Spi-1 (mut Spi-1), NF-IL6 (mut NF-IL6), or both (mut both) binding sites, without changing the nucleotides in the overlapping region (Fig. 2). In agreement with previous studies (13.Kominato Y. Galson D. Waterman W.R. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 59-68Crossref Google Scholar), mutation of the Spi-1 binding site completely prevented activation by Spi-1, either alone or with NF-IL6 (Fig. 1). Transfection of NF-IL6 alone did not affect the promoter activity, even when the overlapping Spi-1 site was disrupted. A promoter containing an intact Spi-1 site and either an intact or mutated NF-IL6 site (WT or mut NF-IL6) supported activation by Spi-1 alone. Importantly, a promoter containing an intact Spi-1, but a mutated NF-IL6 site (mut NF-IL6) retained a majority of the synergistic activation in the presence of both Spi-1 and NF-IL6 (Fig. 1). Consequently, the Spi-1 binding site, but not the NF-IL6 binding site, is critical for the cooperative transactivation of this promoter by Spi-1 and NF-IL6. Using the wild-type il1b probe, containing both the Spi-1 and NF-IL6 sites (Fig. 3 A),in vitro translated Spi-1 can bind avidly to the probe in EMSA (lane 2), as suggested by previous reports (13.Kominato Y. Galson D. Waterman W.R. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 59-68Crossref Google Scholar, 14.Buras J.A. Monks B.G. Fenton M.J. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 4444-4454PubMed Google Scholar). Mutations in the core Spi-1 recognition sequence (AGAA to CTAA) abolished Spi-1 binding (lane 3). Due to the weak equilibrium binding observed by EMSA between NF-IL6 and theil1b probe (−56/−21) (data not shown), we employed a GST-1-hybrid assay, capable of detecting complexes with either low affinity or high decay rates (21.Wara-aswapati N. Yang Z. Waterman W.R. Koyama Y. Tetradis S. Choy B.K. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6803-6814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 3 B shows that a GST-bZIP fusion protein containing the NF-IL6 bZIP DNA-binding domain could bind to the wild-type probe about six times better than the binding between GST control protein and the probe. As expected, the substitution of 4 nucleotides in the NF-IL6 consensus region prevented the probe from being recognized by NF-IL6. NF-IL6 is a 345-amino acid protein with a COOH-terminal basic leucine zipper structure (bZIP) that binds to DNA. The TAD of NF-IL6 has been reported to bind directly to CBP/p300 (26.Mink S. Haenig B. Klempnauer K.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6609-6617Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The extreme amino terminus of NF-IL6 is capable of recruiting SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex and activating endogenous target genes in concert with the TAD (27.Kowenz-Leutz E. Leutz A. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 735-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Between the TAD and the bZIP domains reside regulatory domains, which are involved in intramolecular interactions that inhibit transactivation and DNA binding when NF-IL6 is not activated by phosphorylation (28.Kowenz-Leutz E. Twamley G. Ansieau S. Leutz A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2781-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 29.Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) (Fig.4 A). Spi-1 possesses a COOH-terminal ETS wHTH domain that is involved in both DNA binding as well as protein-protein interactions involving AP-1 family members, NF-IL6β (C/EBPδ), and other proteins (17.Nagulapalli S. Pongubala J.M. Atchison M.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4330-4338PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Bassuk A.G. Leiden J.M.

The amino-terminal 170 amino acids of Spi-1 contains three independent transcriptional activation domains: a glutamine-rich (Q, where Q indicates Gln) domain that can also bind to CBP/p300 (31.Yamamoto H. Kihara-Negishi F. Yamada T. Hashimoto Y. Oikawa T. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1495-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); an amino-terminal, TBP (TATA box-binding protein) binding domain (32.Hagemeier C. Bannister A.J. Cook A. Kouzarides T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A, schematic representation of Spi-1 showing previously identified functional regions and the regions contained within various expression vectors. B, Spi-1 expression vectors as depicted in A were transiently transfected into HeLa S3 cells with wild-type il1b (−59/+12)-luciferase reporter plasmid, in either the presence or absence of NF-IL6 expression vector. Activities are presented as in Fig. 1.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To determine the domains of Spi-1 and NF-IL6 required for transcriptional cooperativity, we assayed deletion mutations of both proteins in transient transfection assays. First, vectors coding for full-length NF-IL6 and a truncation (ΔSpl) that can bind to DNA, but lacks the TAD and a portion of the regulatory region, were co-expressed with full-length Spi-1 and assayed for il1bcore promoter reporter activity in HeLa cells. Western analysis showed that both the full-length and the truncated NF-IL6 (ΔSpl) were correctly expressed by the transfected plasmids in HeLa cells (data not shown). The truncated NF-IL6 could not synergize with Spi-1 (Fig. 4 B). Unlike the observations with NF-IL6, the Spi-1 mutant constructs (Fig. 5,A and B) with deletions of either the Q domain (ΔPN), or the Q domain together with the NH2-terminal TBP binding domain (Δ100, ΔNN) retained significant ability to cooperate with NF-IL6. Deletion of the PEST region increased Spi-1 activation of the il1b core promoter and its ability to synergize with NF-IL6, arguing for its dispensability. We have previously shown that expression of the various Spi-1 derivatives in HeLa cells with these vectors yielded comparable levels of proteins capable of binding specifically to DNA (13.Kominato Y. Galson D. Waterman W.R. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 59-68Crossref Google Scholar). Previously we have shown that the ΔSpl truncated NF-IL6 could antagonize NF-IL6-dependent activation (23.Tsukada J. Saito K. Waterman W.R. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7285-7297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) of the il1bupstream inducible enhancer (UIS), by competing with the wild-type endogenous NF-IL6 for a specific NF-IL6 binding site. We have transfected this dominant negative NF-IL6 mutant into HeLa cells in either the presence or absence of Spi-1. As shown in Fig.6, Spi-1 alone activated theil1b core promoter. Strikingly, cotransfection of the NF-IL6 dominant negative repressed the Spi-1-mediated activation in a dose-dependent fashion, presumably by interfering with endogenous NF-IL6 function. Cotransfection of 0.5 or 1 μg of ΔSpl NF-IL6 vector with a constant amount of Spi-1 expression plasmid (0.25 μg) revealed a 20 and 60% decrease of Spi-1-induced activity, respectively. However, the small amount of basal il1b core promoter activity was not affected by the NF-IL6 dominant negative when Spi-1 was not present, even though NF-IL6 is known to be endogenously expressed in HeLa cells (35.Heiland S. Knippers R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6623-6631Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown by a number of studies that the wHTH domains of Spi-1 and other ETS factors directly interact with various transcription factors, playing a possible role in functional cooperativity (17.Nagulapalli S.

To determine whether Spi-1 and NF-IL6 cooperativity in il1bexpression is mediated by protein-protein binding, we performed GST pull-down protein-interaction assays. The full-length Spi-1 cDNA and truncated sequences were subcloned into plasmid pGEX-2T to produce GST fusion constructs. The 35S-labeled NF-IL6 prepared byin vitro transcription and translation was incubated with similar amounts of either GST or various GST Spi-1 truncations linked to Sepharose beads. After incubation, the beads were intensively washed, and bound proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig.7 A, NF-IL6 binds directly to full-length Spi-1 (lane 2), but not to the GST control (lane 1). More specifically, only the DNA binding domain of Spi-1 (amino acids 171–272) (lane 3) is required to mediate the interaction with NF-IL6. The GST fusion construct containing amino acids 202–254 (lane 4) bound to NF-IL6 as well as the full-length protein. The 202–254 region was further dissected into two pieces, which were also fused to GST (the 243–254 and 202–242 constructs, lanes 5 and 6). Both of these fusion proteins were capable of weakly binding to NF-IL6. It is possible that regions containing both the β2/α2/α3 and β3/β4 (Fig.5 A) structural elements are important in mediating Spi-1 and NF-IL6 interaction. To identify sequences within NF-IL6 necessary for interaction with Spi-1, we prepared in vitro translated35S-labeled NF-IL6 with amino-terminal deletions and tested for interaction with GST-Spi-1 171–272 (Fig. 7 B). Similar to the full-length NF-IL6 (lane 2), the mutant ΔSpl NF-IL6 with the deletion of the region from amino acids 41–205 binds to the Spi-1 ETS domain (lane 4). It is noteworthy that deletion of the amino-terminal 268 amino acids of NF-IL6, leaving only the bZIP DNA binding domain, dramatically increased the binding affinity observed in the GST pull-down assay (lane 6). It was reported that, in the absence of activation, one of two regulatory elements (RD2, Fig. 4) from rat NF-IL6 could inhibit DNA binding by intramolecular interaction, whereas the other element (RD1) similarly inhibited transactivation (28.Kowenz-Leutz E. Twamley G. Ansieau S. Leutz A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 2781-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 29.Williams S.C. Baer M. Dillner A.J. Johnson P.F. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3170-3183Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that the RD2 domain, specifically the region from aa 206 to 268, may also prevent NF-IL6 from interacting with its cofactors. In a reciprocal assay, 35S-labeled Spi-1 ETS domain (from amino acids 171–272) was prepared by in vitro transcription and translation and incubated with GST-bZIP fusion protein containing the bZIP region of NF-IL6 from amino acids 269–345. As expected, the labeled Spi-1 wHTH domain bound strongly to GST-bZIP, but not to GST alone (Fig. 7 C). The expression of il1b is regulated by two independent elements, an upstream inducible sequence (the UIS enhancer) and a cell type-specific promoter element (37.Shirakawa F. Saito K. Bonagura C.A. Galson D.L. Fenton M.J. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1332-1344Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although strong enhancer-dependent activity depends upon a long promoter extending from −131 to +12 (13.Kominato Y. Galson D. Waterman W.R. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 59-68Crossref Google Scholar), weaker enhancer-independent activity can be detected with the shorter −59/+12 promoter. Moreover, we have recently shown that the Spi-1 binding site located at position −50/−39 is responsible for mediating transactivation ofil1b expression by cytomegalovirus IE2 protein, which eliminates the need for the otherwise essential upstream enhancer (21.Wara-aswapati N. Yang Z. Waterman W.R. Koyama Y. Tetradis S. Choy B.K. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6803-6814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we have demonstrated that NF-IL6 dramatically cooperates with Spi-1 to activate the il1b core promoter, where the Spi-1 binding site, but not the putative NF-IL6 site, is critical. Although the Spi-1 recognition site is sufficiently important that mutations leading to a complete loss of Spi-1 binding result in a total loss of promoter activity in the presence of cotransfected Spi-1 and NF-IL6, deletion of the transcription activation domains of Spi-1 results in only a partial loss of its ability to functionally cooperate with NF-IL6. In contrast, the deletion of the NF-IL6 transactivation domain (aa 41–205) completely abolishes its ability to synergize with Spi-1 on the il1b core promoter. Physical interaction between the Spi-1 wHTH and the NF-IL6 bZIP DNA binding domains provides the basis for our model. In this model, the Spi-1 wHTH domain functions to recognize a specific site in the il1b core promoter and tether NF-IL6, which contains an efficient transcription activation domain, which, unlike those of Spi-1, is able to strongly activateil1b expression (Fig. 8). This is distinct from an earlier report of NF-IL6 cooperativity with glucocorticoid receptor, in which the NF-IL6 played a TAD-independent and indirect role (38.Nishio Y. Isshiki H. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1854-1862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It should be noted that we could not detect a reproducible ternary complex (data not shown), involving NF-IL6, Spi-1, and DNA using either EMSA or a more sensitive GST-based two-hybrid approach (21.Wara-aswapati N. Yang Z. Waterman W.R. Koyama Y. Tetradis S. Choy B.K. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6803-6814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting a tenuous interaction. Others have also attempted to detect ternary complexes involving NF-IL6 and have failed (38.Nishio Y. Isshiki H. Kishimoto T. Akira S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1854-1862Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39.Hocke G.M. Barry D. Fey G.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2282-2294Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), supporting this conclusion. Our model is supported by two facts. First, cotransfection of NF-IL6 expression vector significantly increased the ability of both Spi-1Δ100 (lacking both TBP and Q TADs) and Spi-1ΔPEST (lacking the PEST region) to activate the il1b core promoter (Fig. 5). Second, although the dominant negative NF-IL6 was not able to repress the Spi-1-independent activity of the il1b core promoter in NF-IL6-expressing HeLa cells (22.Galson D.L. Hensold J.O. Bishop T.R. Schalling M. D'Andrea A.D. Jones C. Auron P.E. Housman D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2929-2941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it antagonized the Spi-1-mediated activation of the same promoter in a dose-dependent manner. This is consistent with the notion that Spi-1 activation of theil1b core promoter is mediated by NF-IL6 and that the putative overlapping NF-IL6 site is not functional. GST pull-down assays demonstrate that both NF-IL6ΔSpl and the full-length protein interact with Spi-1 at a similar level (Fig. 7), implying that NF-IL6ΔSpl may compete with endogenous NF-IL6 for interaction with Spi-1. It has been reported that Spi-1 without the TBP and Q TADs can activate transcription by playing an architectural role in interaction with NF-EM5/Pip/IRF-4 mediated by the PEST region (40.Pongubala J.M. Atchison M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 127-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Recently, we have shown that functional cooperativity between Spi-1 and the cytomegalovirus IE2 transcription factor does not require any Spi-1 TADs (including PEST) for activity (21.Wara-aswapati N. Yang Z. Waterman W.R. Koyama Y. Tetradis S. Choy B.K. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6803-6814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our data now provide a new example in which the Spi-1 wHTH functions both to bind DNA and to tether a nonviral transcription factor containing a more potent TAD. The mechanism by which the il1b UIS is integrated into the core promoter has always been a puzzle. We have reported that the UIS sequence between −3134 and −2729 contains two NF-IL6 binding sites (11.Auron P.E. Webb A.C. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1994; 5: 573-592PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Tsukada J. Saito K. Waterman W.R. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7285-7297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Also we have shown that the −131/−59, which contains an additional Spi-1 binding site, is critical for enhancer activity (13.Kominato Y. Galson D. Waterman W.R. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 59-68Crossref Google Scholar). Our results now suggest the possibility that factors bound to the UIS, including LIL-Stat, CREB, and NF-IL6 (23.Tsukada J. Saito K. Waterman W.R. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7285-7297Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), may be tethered to the proximity of the transcriptional initiation machinery through NF-IL6-Spi-1 interactions (Fig. 8). However, carefully designed experiments are needed to confirm this speculation. In this report, we have shown that NF-IL6, which is abundant in myeloid cells (41.Scott L.M. Civin C.I. Rorth P. Friedman A.D. Blood. 1992; 80: 1725-1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), strongly synergizes with Spi-1 on the il1b core promoter via PTT (21.Wara-aswapati N. Yang Z. Waterman W.R. Koyama Y. Tetradis S. Choy B.K. Webb A.C. Auron P.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 6803-6814Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in transient transfection assays using Spi-1-deficient HeLa cells. This suggests that PTT also functions in IL-1β-producing monocyte/macrophage cells. However, other bZIP family factors, such as NF-IL6β (C/EBPδ) (17.Nagulapalli S. Pongubala J.M. Atchison M.L. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4330-4338PubMed Google Scholar), c-Jun (20.Behre G. Whitmarsh A.J. Coghlan M.P. Hoang T. Carpenter C.L. Zhang D.E. Davis R.J. Tenen D.G. J. Biol.

It would be interesting to determine whether other factors, which are also expressed at various levels over the course of myeloid differentiation, particularly c-Jun (44.Lord K.A. Abdollahi A.

Consistent with this prediction, we have recently demonstrated that the viral protein HCMV IE2 strongly activates the il1b promoter via PTT using a similar Spi-1 tether (21.Wara-aswapati N. Yang Z.

https://openalex.org/W2057952723,"Deletion and point mutants of soluble thrombomodulin were used to compare and contrast elements of primary structure required for the activation of thrombin-activable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) and protein C. The smallest mutant capable of efficiently promoting TAFI activation contained residues including the c-loop of epidermal growth factor-3 (EGF3) through EGF6. This mutant is 13 residues longer than the smallest mutant that functioned well with protein C; the latter consisted of residues from the interdomain loop connecting EGF3 and EGF4 through EGF6. Alanine point mutants showed no loss of function in protein C activation for mutations within the c-loop of EGF3. In TAFI activation, however, alanine mutations cause a 50% reduction at Tyr-337, 67% reductions at Asp-338 and Leu-339, and 90% or greater reductions at Val-340, Asp-341, and Glu-343. A mutation at Asp-349 in the peptide connecting EGF3 to EGF4 eliminated activity against both TAFI and protein C. Oxidation of Met-388 in the peptide connecting EGF5 to EGF6 reduced the rate of protein C activation by 80% but marginally, if at all, affected the rate of TAFI activation. Mutation at Phe-376 severely reduced protein C activation but only marginally influenced that of TAFI. A Q387P mutation, however, severely reduced both activities. TAFI activation was shown to be Ca2+-dependent. The response, unlike that of protein C, was monotonic and was half-maximal at 0.25 mmCa2+. Like protein C activation, TAFI activation was eliminated by a monoclonal antibody directed at the thrombin-binding domain (EGF5) but was not affected by one directed at EGF2. Thus, elements of structure in the thrombin-binding domain are needed for the activation of both protein C and TAFI, but more of the primary structure is needed for TAFI activation. In addition, some residues are needed for one of the reactions but not the other.

Fibrinolysis Proteolysis. 1999; 13: 72-77Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It is a zymogen that is activated to a carboxypeptidase B-like enzyme by a single thrombin-catalyzed cleavage at arginine 92 (2Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Tan A.K. Eaton D.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5811-5816Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 4Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). The enzyme, designated TAFIa, catalyzes removal of carboxyl-terminal arginine and lysine residues in fibrin as it undergoes fibrinolysis (5Wang W. Boffa M.B. Bajzar L. Walker J.B. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27176-27181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). As a consequence, feedback up-regulation of plasminogen activation is eliminated, and the process of fibrinolysis is suppressed. The activation of TAFI by thrombin and subsequent actions of TAFIa define a molecular connection between the coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades, such that activation of the former suppresses activity in the latter (6Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Although thrombin at the high levels generated after the clotting of fibrin occurs can activate sufficient TAFI to suppress fibrinolysis, thrombin by itself is a relatively weak activator (2Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Delorme M.A. Tam A.S.K. Xu L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 75: 747-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Thrombin bound to thrombomodulin, however, activates TAFI with a catalytic efficiency 1250-fold greater than that of thrombin alone (6Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). Thus, the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex is probably the physiologic activator of TAFI. Thrombomodulin is an intrinsic membrane protein of 557 amino acid residues located on the luminal side of the endothelium (8Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. Esmon N.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 614: 30-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 9Sadler J.E. Lentz S.R. Sheehan J.P. Tsiang M. Wu Q. Haemostasis. 1993; 23: 183-193PubMed Google Scholar). It possesses a domain structure comprising a lectin-like domain (residues 1–226), six tandem epidermal growth factor-like domains joined by small interdomain peptides (EGF1-(227–262), EGF2-(270–305), EGF3-(311–344), EGF4-(351–386), EGF5-(390–407), EGF6-(427–462)), a serine/threonine-rich domain (residues 463–497), a transmembrane domain (residues 498–521) and an intracellular domain (residues 522–557). It was discovered in a search for a cofactor for the thrombin-catalyzed activation of the zymogen, protein C, to the anticoagulant enzyme, activated protein C (10Esmon N.L. Owen W.G. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 859-864Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Like TAFI activation, protein C activation by thrombin is stimulated about 1200-fold by thrombomodulin (11Le Bonniec B.F. Guinto E.R. MacGillivray R.T.A. Stone S.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19055-19061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The activation of protein C by the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex defines a negative feedback loop in the coagulation cascade that down-regulates thrombin formation and is essential for the proper regulation of fibrin formation (8Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. Esmon N.L. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1991; 614: 30-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 9Sadler J.E. Lentz S.R. Sheehan J.P. Tsiang M. Wu Q. Haemostasis. 1993; 23: 183-193PubMed Google Scholar). Structure/function studies of protein C activation indicate that thrombin binding is mediated through the EGF5 and EGF6 domains of thrombomodulin (12Ye J. Liu L.W. Esmon C.T. Johnson A.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11023-11028Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Tsiang M. Lentz S.R. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6164-6170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thrombin binding, however, is not sufficient to stimulate protein C activation. Further elements of primary structure required include the EGF4 domain and the six-residue peptide that connects EGF3 to EGF4 (14Parkinson J.F. Nagashima M. Kuhn I. Leonard J. Morser J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 15Wang W. Nagashima M. Morser J. Nesheim M. Fibrinolysis and Proteolysis. 1998; 12 (abstr.): 11Google Scholar). In addition, methionine 388, which is on the loop connecting EGF5 to EGF6, appears important in protein C activation because when it is oxidized 90% loss of function occurs (16Glaser C.B. Morser J. Clarke J.H. Blasko E. McLean K. Kuhn I. Chang R.J. Lin J.H. Vilander L. Andrews W.H. Light D.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2565-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). This residue, however, can be replaced with leucine with a 2-fold gain in function (17Clarke J.H. Light D.R. Blasko E. Parkinson J.F. Nagashima M. McLean K. Vilander L. Andrews W.H. Morser J. Glaser C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6309-6315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the EGF-like domains of thrombomodulin between residues 333 and 462 indicates that replacing residues Glu-357, Tyr-358, and Phe-376, in EGF4, or Lys-349, in the peptide connecting EGF4 to EGF3, with alanine severely diminishes the activity of thrombomodulin in protein C activation (18Nagashima M. Lundh E. Leonard J.C. Morser J. Parkinson J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2888-2892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Critical residues in EGF-like domains 5 and 6 were also identified. In all, of 77 residues mutated, 22 were found to be critical for TM function in protein C activation. In some respects, thrombomodulin appears to stimulate thrombin-catalyzed activation of protein C and TAFI in very similar ways. The magnitude of the increases in catalytic efficiency are about the same with both zymogens (6Bajzar L. Morser J. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16603-16608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar, 11Le Bonniec B.F. Guinto E.R. MacGillivray R.T.A. Stone S.R. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19055-19061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The kinetics of activation of both zymogens can be accurately described by a mechanism in which thrombin can interact with either thrombomodulin or the substrate, and the so-formed binary complexes can interact with the third component to form a ternary thrombin-thrombomodulin-substrate complex, from which either activated protein C or TAFIa are generated. Differences in the two reactions also have been observed. For example, the P4–P4′ sequences around the activating cleavage site in protein C and TAFI are different. That of protein C is VDPR↓LIDG, whereas that of TAFI is VSPR↓ASAS (2Eaton D.L. Malloy B.E. Tsai S.P. Henzel W. Drayna D. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21833-21838Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Foster D.C. Yoshitake S. Davie E.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 4673-4677Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Thus, the paradigm whereby protein C is a poor substrate for thrombin in the absence of thrombomodulin because of the negatively charged groups at positions P3 and P3′ (20Le Bonniec B.F. MacGillivray R.T.A. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13796-13803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) does not apply to TAFI activation. In addition, Kokame et al. (21Kokame K. Zheng X. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12135-12139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) showed that TAFI activation by cell-bound thrombomodulin constructs is supported well when EGF3 is included but not in its absence, thereby demonstrating that elements of EGF3 are required for this reaction. Preliminary work by our group has shown that the minimal structure required for protein C activation, which comprises EGF domains 4–6 plus the six residues connecting EGF4 to EGF3, does not function well in TAFI activation (15Wang W. Nagashima M. Morser J. Nesheim M. Fibrinolysis and Proteolysis. 1998; 12 (abstr.): 11Google Scholar), but inclusion of the c-loop of EGF3 provides a structure capable of supporting TAFI activation as well as full-length thrombomodulin. The studies reported here were carried out in order to identify more clearly the elements of structure required for TAFI activation and to compare TAFI activation with protein C activation. The results generally show that, although the two processes require common elements of thrombomodulin structure, differences exist such that more of the primary structure of thrombomodulin is required for TAFI activation than for protein C activation, and some residues are needed in one reaction but not the other. Truncated forms of thrombomodulin comprising Solulin (residues 4–490), TME (residues 227–462), TMEc-loop 3–6 (residues 333–462), and TMEi4–6 (residues 345–362) were prepared as described previously (14Parkinson J.F. Nagashima M. Kuhn I. Leonard J. Morser J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Sf9 cells were transfected with the TM constructs, and the proteins were isolated from the media by a combination of chromatography procedures utilizing anion exchange, gel filtration, and thrombin affinity. Purity, assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and silver staining, was 95% or greater. Human plasma TAFI was isolated as described (4Bajzar L. Manuel R. Nesheim M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14477-14484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (649) Google Scholar). Human protein C and thrombin were prepared as described previously (22Bajzar L. Nesheim M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8608-8616Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The thrombin inhibitor dansylarginine N-(3-ethyl-1,5-pentanediyl)amide (DAPA) was synthesized as described (23Nesheim M.E. Prendergast F.G. Mann K.G. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 996-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Point mutants resulting from alanine scanning were generated from the TMEM388L construct. Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli. The procedures and preparation of periplasmic extracts have been described previously (18Nagashima M. Lundh E. Leonard J.C. Morser J. Parkinson J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2888-2892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HEPES, the basic carboxypeptidase substrate hippuryl-arginine, cyanuric chloride, and 1,4-dioxane were obtained from Sigma. All other reagents were of analytical quality. Monoclonal antibodies to the EGF2 or EGF5 domains of thrombomodulin were incubated with TME at room temperature for 60 min in 0.02 m HEPES, 0.15 mNaCl, 0.01% Tween 80, pH 7.4 (HBS), for 60 min in the wells of a microtiter plate. The volume was 3.3 μl; the TMEconcentration was 300 nm, and the antibody concentrations ranged from 0 to 1380 nm. The volume was then increased to 10 μl by adding 6.7 μl of a solution of thrombin and Ca2+ in HBS, and another 10 μl of a solution of TAFI was added. The final volume was 20 μl, and the final concentrations of Ca2+, thrombin, and TAFI were 10 mm, 2 nm, and 500 nm. The solution was incubated for 10 min to allow for partial TAFI activation, and then a solution (180 μl) containing FAAK (furfuryl- (acryloyl)-alaninyl-lysine, Sigma) and DAPA was added. The final concentrations of FAAK (TAFIa substrate) and DAPA (thrombin inhibitor) were 500 and 27 μm, respectively. Activated TAFIa levels were then deduced by monitoring the absorbance at 340 nm over time. The effects of thrombomodulin variants on TAFI activation were measured by incubating TAFI and thrombin at fixed concentrations with the thrombomodulin variants for 10 min at room temperature in HBS plus 5.0 mmCaCl2. The final concentrations of TAFI and thrombin were 0.5 μm and 1.0 nm, respectively. The thrombomodulin concentrations ranged from 0 to 100 nm. The incubations were carried out in the wells of a microtiter plate, and the volume was 20 μl. The reactions were stopped by adding 180 μl of a solution containing DAPA and FAAK in HBS. The final concentrations of DAPA and FAAK were 27 and 500 μm, respectively. The time course of absorbance at 340 nm was then measured to calculate the TAFIa concentrations and thus the rates of TAFI activation. In order to measure the effects of the thrombomodulin variants on protein C activation, thrombin, human protein C, and the thrombomodulin variants were incubated for 10 min in HBS, 5.0 mm CaCl2in a volume of 50 μl in the wells of a microtiter plate thermostated at 37 °C. The final concentrations of protein C and thrombin were 1.0 μm and 2.0 nm, respectively, and the thrombomodulin concentration was varied from 0 to 100 nm. The reactions were stopped by adding a solution (150 μl) of DAPA, EDTA, and the synthetic para-nitroanilide substrate for activated protein C, S2366. The absorbance was monitored over time at 405 nm, and the rate of change of absorbance was determined in order to calculate the activated protein C concentrations and hence calculate the rates of protein C activation. For the activation of TAFI, a 20-μl aliquot of each periplasmic extract was preincubated with thrombin (13 nm final) in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2 for 5 min at room temperature. The mixtures were then incubated with purified recombinant TAFI (18 nm final) and a substrate, hippuryl-arginine (1.0 mm final), in a total volume of 60 μl for 60 min. The amount of activated TAFI was quantitated by measuring the hydrolysis of hippuryl-arginine to hippuric acid, followed by conversion of hippuric acid to a chromogen with 80 μl of phosphate buffer (0.2 m, pH 8.3) and 60 μl of 3% cyanuric acid in dioxane (w/v). After thorough mixing, absorbance of the clear supernatant was measured at 382 nm. The amount of thrombin-dependent activation of TAFI was calculated by subtracting the background absorbance produced in the absence of thrombin for each mutant. Activation of protein C by TME(M388L) alanine mutants was assayed as described previously (16Glaser C.B. Morser J. Clarke J.H. Blasko E. McLean K. Kuhn I. Chang R.J. Lin J.H. Vilander L. Andrews W.H. Light D.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2565-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). All assays contained extracts of DH5α cells transfected with either pSelect-1 vector (no TME), wild-type TME(M388), or TME(M388L) as internal controls. Cofactor activities of TME(M388L) alanine mutants were expressed as percentages of the activity of TME(M388L). Each TM mutant was assayed for both protein C and TAFI activation in duplicate using three independent preparations of extracts. Protein C activation was initiated by adding thrombin to a solution of protein C and Ca2+ in 0.02 mHEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01% Tween 80, pH 7.5, and incubating the mixture at 37 °C in the wells of a microtiter plate. The volume was 100 μl; the final concentration of Ca2+ was varied up to 5.0 mm, and the final concentrations of the other components were thrombin (1.0 nm), protein C (1.0 μm), and Solulin (60 nm). The mixture was incubated for 10 min, and then a solution (100 μl) comprising EDTA (20 mm), S2366 (0.6 mm), and DAPA (30 μm), in the assay buffer, was added to stop the reaction. Activated protein C was then measured by monitoring the absorbance at 405 nm over time. The Ca2+ concentration dependence of TAFI activation was determined by incubating TAFI (1 μm), thrombin (1 nm), and Solulin (20 nm) at 22 °C in 0.02 m HEPES, 0.15 m NaCl, 0.01% Tween 80, pH 7.5, and Ca2+ (0–5 mm) at 22 °C for 5 min. An aliquot (5 μl) was then added to a solution (195 μl) of the buffer containing the thrombin inhibitord-phenylalaninyl-arginyl chloromethyl ketone (10 μm) and the carboxypeptidase B substrate FAAK (100 μm) in the well of a microtiter plate. The absorbance was then monitored over time in a microtiter plate reader in order to determine the TAFIa concentration. The thrombomodulin construct TMEc-loop 3–6, which fully supports both protein C and TAFI activation and contains Met-388 as the sole methionine residue, was incubated at a concentration of 200 nm in 0.02m HEPES, 0.15m NaCl, 0.01% Tween 80, pH 7.5, with chloramine T at various concentrations (0–100 mm) at 22 °C for 30 min. The chloramine T was then quenched by adding methionine at a 10-fold molar excess (2-fold in the case of 100 mm chloramine T) and incubating an additional 30 min. The ability of the oxidized samples to support protein C activation was determined by diluting them 10-fold in a solution of Ca2+ (5.0 mm), protein C (1.0 μm), and thrombin (1 nm). The final volume was 100 μl. After further incubation for 5 min, protein C activation was quenched by adding a solution (100 μl) of EDTA (20 mm), DAPA (60 μm), and S2366 (400 μm). The activated protein C level was then measured by monitoring the absorbance at 405 nm in a microtiter plate reader. The ability of the oxidized thrombomodulin variant to potentiate TAFI activation was measured by diluting it 10-fold in the above-described solution containing TAFI (1 μm) in place of protein C. After 5 min at room temperature, the reaction was quenched by adding a solution (100 μl) of FAAK (200 μm) andd-phenylalanylarginyl chloromethyl ketone (4 μm). The absorbance was then monitored over time at 324 nm to measure the level of TAFIa. Two monoclonal antibodies directed, respectively, at the EGF2 and EGF5 domains of thrombomodulin (18Nagashima M. Lundh E. Leonard J.C. Morser J. Parkinson J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2888-2892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were examined for their ability to inhibit TAFI activation (Fig.1). The antibody directed against EGF2 had no impact on function, but the one directed at EGF5 inhibited function by approximately 95% at a level of antibody stoichiometric with thrombomodulin. These data are very similar to those reported for protein C activation (18Nagashima M. Lundh E. Leonard J.C. Morser J. Parkinson J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2888-2892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Hayashi T. Suzuki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1990; 108: 874-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and indicate that elements of structure in the thrombin-binding region of thrombomodulin are required not only for protein C activation but also for TAFI activation. Previous work showed that oxidation of Met-388 of thrombomodulin by chloramine T or H2O2 decreases cofactor activity for protein C activation by 90% or more (16Glaser C.B. Morser J. Clarke J.H. Blasko E. McLean K. Kuhn I. Chang R.J. Lin J.H. Vilander L. Andrews W.H. Light D.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2565-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Further work showed that replacement of Met-388 with leucine not only protects thrombomodulin from oxidation but also doubles its activity in protein C activation (17Clarke J.H. Light D.R. Blasko E. Parkinson J.F. Nagashima M. McLean K. Vilander L. Andrews W.H. Morser J. Glaser C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6309-6315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because these studies identified Met-388 as a very important residue in protein C activation, similar experiments were performed to investigate the impact of oxidation of Met-388 on TAFI activation. A soluble construct of thrombomodulin comprising the c-loop of EGF3 through the sixth EGF domain and containing Met-388 was treated with chloramine T. The excess chloramine T was reduced with methionine, and the cofactor activity was measured with TAFI and protein C as substrates (Fig.2). Whereas oxidation reduced the activity with protein C by over 80%, it reduced activity with TAFI only marginally. In addition, whereas substitution of methionine with leucine at position 388 increased activity in protein C activation 2-fold, it had no effect on TAFI activation (Fig. 4 B). These data imply that oxidation of M388 has less impact on TAFI activation than on protein C activation.Figure 4Relative cofactor activities of point mutants in TAFI and protein C activation. Alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to prepare point mutations in soluble thrombomodulin. Rates of protein C and TAFI activation (relative to the rate of activation with mutant TMEM388L) are shown for TAFI (solid bars) and protein C (hatched bars). Results for residues in the c-loop of EGF3 are shown in A; results for other residues are shown in B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Initial rates of the activation of PC or TAFI were measured at various concentrations of forms of recombinant thrombomodulin truncated from the amino terminus. Examples are shown in Fig. 3, A and B,for thrombomodulin constructs including full-length soluble thrombomodulin (Solulin, residues 4–490); TME, which consists of the six EGF domains of thrombomodulin (residues 227–462); and TMEi4–6, which consists of EGF domain 4 through 6 plus the six residue peptide connecting EGF3 to EGF4 (residues 345–462). All three constructs were approximately equivalent in protein C activation as has been shown previously (14Parkinson J.F. Nagashima M. Kuhn I. Leonard J. Morser J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 15Wang W. Nagashima M. Morser J. Nesheim M. Fibrinolysis and Proteolysis. 1998; 12 (abstr.): 11Google Scholar). TMEi4–6 was the smallest construct able to support protein C activation at this level. In contrast, although Solulin and TME supported TAFI activation well, TMEi4–6, did not. Results obtained with these as well as other constructs in similar experiments are summarized in Table I. As these results indicate, a construct which includes EGF domains 4–6 plus the interdomain loop between EGF domains 3 and 4 will efficiently promote protein C activation but not TAFI activation. With TAFI, further amino-terminal elements of structure of thrombomodulin associated with the c-loop of EGF3 are required.Table IRelative activities of truncated soluble mutants of thrombomodulin in protein C and TAFI activationConstructResiduesProtein CTAFISolulin4–490100100EGF 1–6227–462100105EGF 2–6270–462961-aData from Parkinson et al.

Open table in a new tab In order to further identify residues within the c-loop of EGF3 required for cofactor activity in TAFI activation, point mutants with alanine substituted for individual amino acids contained within the thrombomodulin sequence spanning the c-loop of EGF3 through the interdomain loop connecting EGF domains 3 and 4 (residues 333–350) were prepared and investigated with respect to their abilities to support protein C and TAFI activation. The alanine point mutants of thrombomodulin were expressed as secretory proteins, and periplasmic extracts were prepared as described previously (18Nagashima M. Lundh E. Leonard J.C. Morser J. Parkinson J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2888-2892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In an earlier study, we established the conditions in which recombinant mutants in periplasmic extracts were used without purification to measure their relative cofactor activity for the activation of protein C. Briefly, the M388L mutant in periplasmic extracts had a protein C cofactor activity of 20.1 ± 5.2 units/ml (n = 18), and the ratio of M388L/Met-388 cofactor activities was 2.35 ± 0.39, with an inter-assay coefficient of variation of 16.7% (n = 18). Since total expression levels of M388L and Met-388 in extracts were similar by Western blot analysis using polyclonal anti-TME antibody, the ratio of M388L to Met-388 (wild type) activities in extracts was consistent with those of the purified proteins, showing that thrombomodulin mutants in the periplasmic extracts were correctly folded. This was confirmed when specific activities for Met-388 and M388L were determined by measuring antigen levels in extracts using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for thrombomodulin with two monoclonal anti-TME antibodies. The specific activities of Met-388 and M388L were 437,000 ± 24,000 and 1,019,000 ± 87,000 units/mg of protein, respectively, giving a M388L/Met-388-specific ratio of 2.33 (n = 2). Furthermore, other mutants that exhibited very low cofactor activities for protein C were analyzed by Western blotting to ensure that the expression levels were similar to those of active mutants. Thus, this system provides a fast and easy method for comparing cofactor activities of different mutants. In all the experiments, we included extracts prepared from E. coli transformed with a vector only, Met-388 (wild type), and M388L as internal controls. In the current study, the ratio of M388L/Met-388 cofactor activities for activation of protein C was 2.0 ± 0.38 (n = 6). The results obtained with these mutants (Fig.4, A and B) indicate that all mutants within the c-loop of EGF3 had modest or negligible effects on protein C activation. These results are consistent with those obtained previously (18Nagashima M. Lundh E. Leonard J.C. Morser J. Parkinson J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2888-2892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, when the same periplasmic extracts containing these mutants were tested in a TAFI cofactor activity assay, several of the mutants substantially influenced TAFI activation. Because protein C activation was not significantly different from control values, it is likely that the proteins are in the correct conformation in the periplasmic extracts. With respect to TAFI activation, the mutation Y337A caused a 50% reduction in activity; those at Asp-338 and Leu-339 caused a 67% loss; and those at Val-340, Asp-341, and Glu-343 caused greater than 90% losses. The alanine substitution mutation at Val-345, Glu-346, or Val-348 within the interdomain loop between EGF3 and -4 caused modest 30–40% reductions in protein C activation (Fig. 4 B). Similar effects on TAFI activation were obtained with mutations E346A and V348A, whereas mutation V345A resulted in a 70% reduction in TAFI activation. The D349A mutation in the interdomain loop reduced both protein C and TAFI activation rates by 95%. Thus, these data correlate well with the results obtained with deletion mutants (Fig. 3,A and B) in that they imply that the c-loop of EGF3 is not needed for protein C activation but is for TAFI activation. They also identify residues Tyr-337, Asp-338, Leu-339, and Val-345 as important for TAFI activation and residues Val-340, Asp-341, and Glu-343 as virtually essential. In addition, Asp-349 appears to be very important in the activation of both zymogens. We also investigated the effect of three mutations within EGF4, previously found to be critical for the activation of protein C (18Nagashima M. Lundh E. Leonard J.C. Morser J. Parkinson J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2888-2892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), on TAFI activation. The mutations at Glu-357 and Tyr-358 (Fig. 4 B) caused marked reductions in both TAFI activation and protein C activation. The mutation at Phe-376, in contrast, resulted in a profound loss in protein C activation but only in a modest reduction in TAFI activation. Another mutation, Q387P, which causes a large reduction of cofactor activity for protein C activation (17Clarke J.H. Light D.R. Blasko E. Parkinson J.F. Nagashima M. McLean K. Vilander L. Andrews W.H. Morser J. Glaser C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6309-6315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), also reduced cofactor activity for TAFI activation by over 95%. Others (25Light D.R. Glaser C.B. Betts M. Blasko E. Campbell E. Clarke J.H. McCaman M. McLean K. Nagashima M. Parkinson J.F. Rumennik G. Young T. Morser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 26Parkinson J.F. Grinnell B.W. Moore R.E. Hoskins J. Vlahos C.J. Bang N.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12602-12610Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that protein C activation in the presence of thrombin and thrombomodulin without chondroitin sulfate exhibits a complex, biphasic dependence on the Ca2+ concentration. As the Ca2+ concentration is increased, the rate of protein C activation typically increases up to a maximum at about 0.25 mm Ca2+ and then decreases toward a plateau at about 5.0 mmCa2+. In order to determine whether this characteristic is shared by TAFI activation, Ca2+ concentrations were systematically increased, and initial rates of TAFI activation in the presence of Solulin were measured. Similar experiments were performed with protein C activation for comparison. The results (Fig.5, A and B) indicate that both protein C and TAFI activation reactions are Ca2+-dependent. TAFI activation, however, does not exhibit the biphasic response of protein C activation. Instead, initial rates of TAFI activation are monophasic with respect to Ca2+ and increase toward a maximum as levels of Ca2+ exceed 1–2 mm. The half-maximal response is obtained at 0.24 ±.05 mm Ca2+. The concentration of Ca2+ when the rate of TAFI activation is one-half of its maximum is very similar to that at which the maximum is obtained in the biphasic Ca2+ dependence of protein C activation. Thrombomodulin is a cofactor for the thrombin-catalyzed activation of both protein C and TAFI. In both cases a single proteolytic cleavage generates an enzyme from a plasma zymogen, and both enzymes modulate the balance between fibrin formation and degradation. Activated protein C, which is generated from protein C, is a serine protease that down-regulates thrombin formation and thereby down-regulates fibrin formation. TAFI is activated to TAFIa, which is a carboxypeptidase B-like enzyme that suppresses plasmin formation and thereby attenuates fibrin removal. Consequently, thrombomodulin is involved in the regulation of both the coagulation and fibrinolytic cascades. The present studies indicate that the activation of both protein C and TAFI requires the fifth and sixth EGF domains of thrombomodulin, which contain structures needed for thrombin binding and high affinity Ca2+ binding (25Light D.R. Glaser C.B. Betts M. Blasko E. Campbell E. Clarke J.H. McCaman M. McLean K. Nagashima M. Parkinson J.F. Rumennik G. Young T. Morser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although these elements of structure are necessary for function, they are not sufficient to enhance activation of either protein C or TAFI. With protein C as substrate, EGF4 plus the 6-residue peptide connecting it to EGF3 are also needed. Although these elements of structure are both necessary and sufficient for protein C activation, they are not sufficient for TAFI activation. Thus, further residues amino-terminal to the peptide connecting EGF3 to EGF4 are required. The current work showed that the 13 residues comprising the c-loop of EGF3 suffice to restore fully TAFI activation function when included with the minimum fragment necessary for protein C activation. This is consistent with the results reported previously by Kokameet al. (21Kokame K. Zheng X. Sadler J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12135-12139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) who showed that EGF3, in addition to EGF domains 4–6, is required for TAFI activation by cell-bound constructs of thrombomodulin. Our current study has identified the important residues within the c-loop of EGF3 and the interdomain connecting it to EGF4 for activation of TAFI. The residues Val-340, Asp-341, Glu-343, and Asp-349 are essential for the activation of TAFI. Furthermore, the mutations at Tyr-337, Asp-338, Leu-339, Val-345, Glu-346, and Val-348 caused a significant reduction in the activation of TAFI. In addition, two residues, Glu-357 and Tyr-358, within EGF4, which were identified as critical residues for protein C activation, were shown to be important for TAFI activation as well. Intriguingly, the difference in importance of Phe-376 for TAFI and protein C activation suggests the requirements for thrombomodulin structure are more constrained when protein C is the substrate of the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex. Both TAFI activation and protein C activation by thrombin-thrombomodulin are Ca2+-dependent. The dependences are quite different, however. Protein C activation rates exhibit a biphasic response to Ca2+ with a maximum at about 0.25 mm Ca2+. TAFI activation rates increase monotonically with Ca2+, and the half-maximal effect occurs at a Ca2+ concentration of 0.25 mm. A recent study by Light et al. (25Light D.R. Glaser C.B. Betts M. Blasko E. Campbell E. Clarke J.H. McCaman M. McLean K. Nagashima M. Parkinson J.F. Rumennik G. Young T. Morser J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 262: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) of the binding of Ca2+ to thrombomodulin identified one very high affinity site in EGF6 (Kd<2 μm) and another site (Kd = 30 μm), which most likely comprises the Ca2+-binding consensus site in EGF3 (residues 307–338). The very high affinity site appears to be very important in thrombin binding. The role of the second site in protein C and TAFI activation, if any, is difficult to infer from the present data, even though both protein C and TAFI activation show responses to Ca2+ at levels that far exceed that required to saturate fully the very high affinity site. Since protein C activation is fully supported by a construct that presumably does not possess the second site (TMEi4–6), the second site apparently is not needed in this reaction. Whether the binding of a second calcium ion is required for TAFI activation cannot be inferred with certainty, because the smallest construct required for TAFI activation is TMEc-loop 3–6 (residues 333–462). Whether this thrombomodulin construct possesses a second Ca2+-binding site is not known, but its amino terminus possesses six carboxyl-terminal residues of the 32-residue Ca2+-binding consensus sequence. The Ca2+ dependences of protein C and TAFI activation reported here were both obtained with Solulin, which does have both Ca2+-binding sites. The increase in protein C activation rates up to a maximum at 250 μmCa2+ could reflect binding of Ca2+ to protein C, to thrombomodulin, or both. The half-maximal rate at 250 μm Ca2+ in TAFI activation most likely reflects an interaction of Ca2+ with thrombomodulin. Although the dissociation constant for one of Ca2+-thrombomodulin interactions is 30 μm, a half-maximal effect in rate at 250 μm could occur if linkage exists between the Ca2+, thrombomodulin, thrombin, and TAFI interactions required for the expression of activity. Thus, the increase in rate 250 μm Ca2+ in protein C activation and the half-maximal effect in TAFI activation could represent similar Ca2+, thrombin, thrombomodulin, substrate interactions. The differential effects of oxidation of Met-388 on protein C and TAFI activation have notable potential ramifications. They make possible a mechanism whereby protein C activation could be attenuated without influencing TAFI activation under physiologic or pathophysiologic conditions. As shown by Glaser et al. (16Glaser C.B. Morser J. Clarke J.H. Blasko E. McLean K. Kuhn I. Chang R.J. Lin J.H. Vilander L. Andrews W.H. Light D.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2565-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), activated neutrophils can cause oxidation of Met-388 and inactivate thrombomodulin, thereby potentially favoring a procoagulant state. This effect could be further amplified by failure of oxidation to inhibit TAFI activation and thereby relieve the suppression of fibrinolysis by activated TAFI. The net result might be greater deposition of fibrin in various organs during inflammatory conditions. Thrombomodulin null mice die during embryonic development (27Healy A.M. Rayburn H.B.

Mice with the Q387P mutation are normal but have higher levels of fibrin deposition than wild-type littermates (28Weiler-Guettler H. Christie P.D. Beeler D.L. Healy A.M. Hancock W.W. Rayburn H.

Chem. 1993; 268: 6309-6315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that thrombomodulin with the Q387P mutation did not enhance activation of protein C. Here we show that TAFI activation is reduced to the same extent as that of protein C activation, suggesting that the rescue of thrombomodulin null mice by the Q387P mutant thrombomodulin is not due to its ability to activate TAFI. Differences between protein C and TAFI activation are associated not only with thrombomodulin but also with thrombin. Hall and co-workers (29Hall S.W. Nagashima M. Zhao L. Morser J. Leung L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25510-25516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) investigated protein C and TAFI activation with a collection of 56 purified thrombin mutants, in which 76 charged or polar surface residues were replaced with alanine. Among these mutants three were found to have decreased ability to activate TAFI but normal activity in protein C activation. Similarly, another three were found to have diminished ability to activate protein C but normal activity in TAFI activation. In addition, 12 mutants were found to be deficient with both substrates. Eleven of the latter mutants had mutations of residues in exosite I, which is necessary for thrombin to interact effectively with thrombomodulin. The other mutated residue was W60dA of the insertion loop above the active site. The residues for which mutations selectively affect TAFI activation mapped to a cluster above the active-site cleft, whereas those for which mutations selectively affect protein C activation mapped to a cluster below it. The results of Hall et al. (29Hall S.W. Nagashima M. Zhao L. Morser J. Leung L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25510-25516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) complement those reported here on different structural requirements in thrombomodulin for protein C and TAFI activation. Both previous and current results indicate that the interaction of the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex with TAFI differs from that with protein C at the level of both the enzyme, thrombin, and its cofactor, thrombomodulin."
https://openalex.org/W2047307745,"We examined the mechanism of H2O2-induced cytotoxicity and its relationship to oxidation in human leukemia cells. The HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cell line was sensitive to H2O2, and at concentrations up to about 20–25 μm, the killing was mediated by apoptosis. There was limited evidence of lipid peroxidation, suggesting that the effects of H2O2 do not involve hydroxyl radical. When HL-60 cells were exposed to H2O2 in the presence of the spin trap α-(4-pyridyl-1-oxide)-N-tert-butylnitrone (POBN), we detected a 12-line electron paramagnetic resonance spectrum assigned to the POBN/POBN⋅ N-centered spin adduct previously described in peroxidase-containing cell-free systems. Generation of this radical by HL-60 cells had the same H2O2concentration dependence as initiation of apoptosis. In contrast, studies with the K562 human erythroleukemia cell line, which is often used for comparison with the HL-60, and with high passaged HL-60 cells (spent HL-60) studied under the same conditions failed to generate POBN⋅. Cellular levels of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase did not explain the differences between these cell lines. Interestingly, the K562 and spent HL-60 cells, which did not generate the radical, also failed to undergo H2O2-induced apoptosis. Based on this we reasoned that the difference in H2O2-induced apoptosis might be due to the enzyme myeloperoxidase. Only the apoptosis-manifesting HL-60 cells contained appreciable immunoreactive protein or enzymatic activity of this cellular enzyme. When HL-60 cells were incubated with methimazole or 4-aminobenzoic acid hydrazide, which are inhibitors of myeloperoxidase, they no longer underwent H2O2-induced apoptosis. Hypochlorous acid stimulated apoptosis in both HL-60 and spent HL-60 cells, indicating that another oxidant generated by myeloperoxidase induces apoptosis and that it may be the direct mediator of H2O2-induced apoptosis. Taken together these observations indicate that H2O2-induced apoptosis in the HL-60 human leukemia cell is mediated by myeloperoxidase and is linked to a non-Fenton oxidative event marked by POBN⋅.

In this regard, H2O2 has been implicated as a possible intracellular mediator in the toxicity of external stimuli such as ultraviolet radiation (5.Caceres-Dittmar G. Ariizumi K. Xu S. Tapia F.J.

Because it is only a weak oxidizing agent (kinetically), it is generally assumed that it reacts with Fe2+ or Cu+ to form ⋅OH via the Fenton reaction (16.Puppo A. Halliwell B. Biochem. J. 1988; 249: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar,17.Mello Filho A.C. Hoffmann M.E. Meneghini R. Biochem. J. 1984; 218: 273-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). H2O2+Fe2+→Fe3++OH−+·OHEquation 1 It is often assumed that this one-electron reduction is the pathway to explain H2O2 toxicity (18.Qian S.Y. Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 26: 1447-1456Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). However, we do not know if H2O2 itself or an oxidative product such as ⋅OH targets membranes to react with polyunsaturated fatty acids or cholesterol (19.Christ M. Luu B. Mejia J.E. Moosbrugger I. Bischoff P. Immunology. 1993; 78: 455-460PubMed Google Scholar) or causes oxidation of DNA or proteins to trigger cytotoxicity. In phagocytes, microbicidal activity depends upon toxic oxygen-derived products such as H2O2, HOCl derived from H2O2, and subsequent oxidizing species such as chloramines and ⋅OH (20.Hampton M.B. Kettle A.J. Winterbourn C.C. Blood. 1998; 92: 3007-3017Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HOCl is generated by H2O2 in the presence of chloride and the granule protein myeloperoxidase (MPO) (donor: H2O2 oxidoreductase, EC 1.11.1.7). H2O2+Cl−+H+→HOCl+H2OEquation 2 Oxidative modification by this H2O2/MPO/halide system may play a part in inflammatory, neurologic, neoplastic, and vascular disease. One specific marker of myeloperoxidase-related oxidation, 3-chlorotyrosine, has been isolated from low density lipoprotein in human atherosclerotic lesions at considerably higher concentrations than in normal aorta (21.Hazen S.L. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2075-2081Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar). Furthermore, chlorotyrosine levels were higher in vivoin the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome than those in control patients, and the amounts correlated with myeloperoxidase concentration (22.Lamb N.J. Gutteridge J.M. Baker C. Evans T.W. Quinlan G.J. Crit. Care Med. 1999; 27: 1738-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, may be initiated by diverse stimuli, some of which are pathologic and some of which are part of the normal processes of development and homeostasis in living organisms. We have a partial understanding of the signaling events that precede the morphologic changes characteristic of apoptosis; however, we do not understand how chemical stimuli such as H2O2result in the induction of apoptosis (23.Kroemer G. Dallaporta B. Resche-Rigon M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 619-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1768) Google Scholar, 24.Reed J.C. J. Clin. Oncol. 1999; 17: 2941-2953Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25.Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For many agents that induce apoptosis, the target(s) or effectors that transduce the initiation event are unidentified. There is evidence that reactive oxygen species such as H2O2 may play a role in this process especially with selected initiators, because antioxidants inhibit apoptosis (26.Chau Y.P. Shiah S.G. Don M.J. Kuo M.L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 660-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 27.Kakeya H. Onose R. Osada H.

In fact, both forms of cell death, apoptosis and necrosis, can be blocked by antioxidants (29.Zamzami N. Marchetti P. Castedo M. Zanin C. Vayssiere J.L. Petit P.X. Kroemer G. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1661-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar). In the present study we investigated the oxidative events that are associated with H2O2-induced apoptosis in the human HL-60 leukemia cell. We found that the generation of a POBN free radical correlated with programmed cell death in human leukemia cells and both seemed to be mediated by cellular MPO. HL-60 and K562 cells (obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture, Rockville, MD) were cultured at 37 °C in humidified air in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Life Technologies, Inc.) and supplemented with 2 mml-glutamine, 85 units/ml penicillin, and 85 μg/ml streptomycin. HL-60 is a human myeloid leukemia cell that grows as a suspension culture (30.Gallagher R. Collins S. Trujillo J. McCredie K. Ahearn M. Tsai S. Metzgar R. Aulakh G. Ting R. Ruscetti F. Gallo R. Blood. 1979; 54: 713-733Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HL-60 cells produce MPO that has the same electrophoretic behavior as MPO found in normal human neutrophils (31.Nauseef W.M. Blood. 1986; 67: 865-872Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HL-60 cells can be induced by chemicals and drugs to differentiate, but in this study the undifferentiated line was used. It is known to undergo apoptosis when exposed to anticancer agents (32.Mansat V. Laurent G. Levade T. Bettaieb A. Jaffrezou J.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 5300-5304PubMed Google Scholar). High-passaged HL-60 cells that had lost much of their biological versatility, including the ability to undergo H2O2-induced apoptosis, are referred to as spent HL-60 cells. These cells were passed greater than 85 times, and at about that point they began to change biologically. K562 cells are a human myeloid leukemia cell line derived from the bone marrow of a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia (33.Lozzio B.B. Lozzio C.B. Leukocyte Res. 1979; 3: 363-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). K562 cells grow as a suspension culture and are often used for comparison to HL-60 (34.Wagner B.A. Buettner G.R. Oberley L.W. Burns C.P. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 2809-2816PubMed Google Scholar). Cells in the log phase (48-h cultures) were washed and placed in the above media with the cell density adjusted to 10 × 106/ml (electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR) studies) or 0.5 × 106/ml (apoptosis studies). All experiments were done in the presence of RPMI 1640 plus 10% fetal calf serum unless specified otherwise. Cells were counted with a cell counter (model Zf; Coulter, Inc., Hialeah, FL). Trypan blue dye exclusion was used to assess membrane damage during exposures to H2O2. After treatment, cells were washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline, and a cell pellet was formed by centrifugation at 500 × g in an Eppendorf Model 5415C centrifuge. The supernatants were removed, and 330 μl of Sarkosyl detergent lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5% w/v sodium-N-lauroyl sarcosine, pH 7.5) and 13 μl of Proteinase K (15.6 mg/ml) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals GmbH, Germany) were added, vortexed, and allowed to digest overnight at 37 °C. RNase A (0.3 mg/ml) was added, and the samples were incubated for 1 h at 56 °C. The lysates were then extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), vortexed, and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 5 min. The upper phase containing the DNA was transferred to new tubes, 40 μl of 3m sodium acetate and 1 ml of 100% ethanol were added, and the samples were kept overnight at −20 °C to precipitate DNA. The sample was then centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was removed, and 0.5 ml of 70% ethanol was added to the DNA pellet. The sample was centrifuged for 5 min at 16,000 ×g, and the supernatant was removed. The DNA pellet was then placed under a vacuum until a dry pellet was obtained. The DNA was solubilized in Tris/EDTA (10 mm/1 mm) buffer and mixed. The resultant DNA in solution was then quantitated spectrophotometrically at 260/280 nm. Total DNA (2 μg) was mixed with 10× BlueJuice gel loading buffer (Life Technologies, Inc.) and tracking dye and loaded on 1% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide. Gels were electrophoresed for 2.5 h at 50 V, destained with water, and illuminated with ultraviolet light for examination and photography. Following experimental exposures to oxidants, cells underwent a 24-h additional incubation at 37 °C, and then aliquots were centrifuged for 5 min at 300 × g. The cell pellets were then resuspended in 0.9% NaCl with 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. Cytospin preparations were made with the resuspended cells. Dried slide preparations were then stained with Wright's stain, and morphological evaluations were made by light microscopy. Triplicate 100-cell counts on consecutive cells in at least three regions of each slide from different samples were done to determine the percentage of apoptotic cells. The morphologic features of apoptosis in the HL-60 cells have been described (35.Kravtsov V.D. Greer J.P. Whitlock J.A. Koury M.J. Blood. 1998; 92: 968-980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were scored as apoptotic if there was clear expression of either densely condensed nuclear chromatin, including chromatin collapsed down into crescents along the nuclear envelope, or apoptotic bodies. If these features were absent, then both cell shrinkage and membrane blebbing were required. Peroxidase activity was determined by the ability to oxidize tetramethylbenzidine (36.Bozeman P.M. Learn D.B. Thomas E.L. J Immunol. Methods. 1990; 126: 125-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 37.McCormick M.L. Buettner G.R. Britigan B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29265-29269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice using 0.9% NaCl, and the cell density was adjusted to 1 × 106 cells/ml using the Coulter Model Zf cell counter. Cells (200,000 total) were then placed in 3.05 ml of MPO assay buffer (50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.4) and sonicated for 10 s with an ultrasonic probe. The cellular lysate was equilibrated to room temperature, then 50 μl of 100 mm3,3′,5,5′-tetramethylbenzidine in dimethylformamide was added and the assay was initiated with 200 μl of 5.25 mmH2O2 in assay buffer. The sample was mixed and allowed to incubate for 3 min prior to the addition of 100 μl of catalase (0.3 mg/ml in water), then 3.4 ml of ice-cold 200 mm acetic acid in water was added to quench the reaction. The samples were briefly centrifuged to remove cell debris, and the absorbance was read at 655 nm. Washed cells were sonicated on ice (three times for 30 s each) using a Vibra Cell cup horn sonicator (Sonics and Materials, Inc., Newtown, CT) at maximum power. Protein from 1.5 × 105 cells was placed in each well, separated by electrophoresis on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels (38.Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar), and subjected to Western analysis. Briefly, separated proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes and blocked in 5% dry milk in 0.01 m Tris/0.15 m NaCl buffer, pH 8.0, and 0.1% Tween 20. Blots were rinsed three times and incubated with MPO antibodies for 1 h at room temperature. Monospecific rabbit polyclonal antiserum against MPO was acquired from Dr. William M. Nauseef (39.Nauseef W.M. Root R.K. Malech H.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 71: 1297-1307Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) and diluted 1:500 for use. After further washing, the blot was incubated in goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase at a 1:10,000 dilution for 1 h at room temperature. Blots were washed again, and bands were visualized using chemiluminescence. To a HL-60 cell suspension (10 × 106/ml) in RPMI 1640/10% FBS were added 50 mm POBN and then H2O2. Immediately, an aliquot of the sample was placed into an EPR quartz flat cell and positioned in a TM110 cavity of a Bruker ESP-300 EPR spectrometer. The EPR scans were initiated in the “additive” mode for 80 consecutive scans, with approximately 55 min of monitoring time. To monitor ⋅OH radical production, as hydroxyethyl radical adducts, experiments were set up as described above but with the addition of 1% ethanol. EPR instrument settings were as follows: 40-milliwatt microwave power at a frequency of 9.78 GHz; modulation frequency of 100 kHz; receiver gain 2.5 × 105; modulation amplitude 0.7 G; and scanning rate 50 G/42 s with a time constant of 20.5 ms. Spin adduct concentration estimates were made using 3-carboxyproxyl (Aldrich) as a standard (40.Buettner G.R. Free Radic. Res. Commun. 1990; 10: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cell samples were pelleted at 300 × g for 10 min and washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and additionally with 0.9% NaCl. The sample pellet was suspended in 2 ml of 0.9% NaCl, and then butylated hydroxytoluene in ethanol (385 μm final concentration) was added to the samples, which were then frozen at −20 °C until assay. Samples were thawed and vortexed vigorously, and an aliquot was taken for a Lowry protein assay (41.Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To the remaining sample was added 230 μl of trichloroacetic acid-saturated solution (250 g of trichloroacetic acid to 100 ml of water), which was then vortexed, and centrifuged at 3000 × g (10 min) to precipitate protein. Supernatant (1.6 ml) was placed in glass test tubes, and 200 μl of 14.4 mg/ml 2-thiobarbituric acid in 0.1 n NaOH solution was added. The samples were incubated for 30 min at 75 °C. Standards were prepared from the hydrolysis of 1,1,2,2-ethoxypropane in a 40% trichloroacetic acid solution. After cooling, the absorbances of the samples were read at 535 nm and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) values were calculated as both nanomoles/2.5 × 106 cells and nanomoles/mg of cell protein. Mn-SOD and CuZn-SOD (42.Spitz D.R. Oberley L.W. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 8-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar), catalase (43.Aebi H. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (18933) Google Scholar), and glutathione peroxidase (44.Lawrence R.A. Burk R.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 71: 952-958Crossref PubMed Scopus (2937) Google Scholar) enzymatic activities were determined in washed cells after sonication. The results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Significant differences were evaluated with the unpaired Student's t test or one-way analysis of variance. Dunnett's test was used for pairwise comparisons versuscontrol (45.Dunnett C.W. J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 1955; 50: 1096-1121Crossref Scopus (5088) Google Scholar). All statistical tests were carried out at the 5% level of significance. H2O2 is a natural product of metabolism, but at sufficient concentrations it produces cell damage. To demonstrate whether H2O2 induces apoptosis in HL-60 cells, we treated HL-60 cells with incremental concentrations of H2O2 for 24 h, isolated genomic DNA, and separated it on agarose gels looking for the important hallmark of apoptosis, endonuclease fragmentation of DNA. Fig.1 is a representative gel showing DNA laddering induced by H2O2. Cells incubated with 0 or 2 μm of H2O2 showed no evidence of DNA fragmentation. However, cells treated with 20 μm H2O2 showed considerable DNA fragmentation with the internucleosomal base pair fragments that were similar to those produced by UV light in the lane 2 positive control. Studies at intermediate concentrations indicated that the threshold for apoptosis was 10–15 μm (data not shown). At >20 μm H2O2 concentrations, nonspecific DNA degradation predominated (loss of high molecular weight DNA and non-endonuclease-associated fragmentation of DNA resulting in smearing). This loss of high molecular weight DNA and background smearing is consistent with cell necrosis. Therefore, H2O2 induces apoptosis in HL-60 cells at lower concentrations beginning at 10–15 μm and necrosis at concentrations >20 μm. Increasing concentrations of H2O2 were added to the growth media of HL-60 cells, and after 24 h, trypan blue exclusion was measured as an estimate of membrane damage. As can be seen in Fig.2, 85% of the cells were capable of excluding the dye at 2 μm H2O2and more than 71% at 20 μm. Beginning at 200 μm H2O2 the value differed significantly from the control mean; therefore, at higher concentrations, the membrane became permeable. This indicates that the necrosis observed at H2O2 concentrations of 200 μm and above is associated with, and possibly due to, acute membrane damage. To determine the minimum duration of H2O2 exposure time required to induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells, we exposed them to 20 μmH2O2, and then, at 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, and 5 min, catalase (1000 units/ml) was added to remove the H2O2. The cells were then allowed to incubate for 24 h before the DNA was extracted for agarose gel electrophoresis. Fig. 3 shows that, at the minimum, 1.5 min of exposure to 20 μmH2O2 is required to induce apoptosis. To determine if lipid peroxidation has a role in H2O2-induced apoptosis, we evaluated the levels of TBARS from cells treated with different concentrations of H2O2 for 24 h (Fig. 4). There was a low level of TBARS production from H2O2 at all concentrations. For comparison, the greater TBARS generation from Fe2+ is also shown. This suggests that lipid peroxidation is not being induced to any great extent by the H2O2. The TBARS production was also determined as nanomoles/mg of protein, and the conclusions were similar. It is known that TBARS are unstable in the presence of H2O2 (46.Kostka P. Kwan C.-Y. Lipids. 1989; 24: 545-549Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and such degradation could explain our low TBARS values. However, this instability is usually seen at mm concentrations and, in fact, 20 mmH2O2, the highest concentration we used in any experiment, degraded the malondialdehyde-thiobarbituric acid complex by less than 6% (46.Kostka P. Kwan C.-Y. Lipids. 1989; 24: 545-549Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We next measured the generation of ⋅OH measured as hydroxyethyl adducts of POBN detected by EPR after exposing HL-60 cells to 20 μmH2O2 in RPMI 1640/10% FBS in the presence of 50 mm POBN under the same conditions as those for apoptosis. There was generation of hydroxyethyl adduct, but the magnitude of the adduct production was no greater than that produced by the cell-free media exposed to H2O2 (data not shown). This observation does not preclude the possibility of production of ⋅OH by the cells but only that the amount produced by the cells is not distinguishable from that produced in a cell-free environment. This can be compared with the generation of about 20-fold more ⋅OH when HL-60 cells are exposed to Fe2+. We next examined other free radical events resulting from H2O2 exposure using the same conditions as those for apoptosis. Fig.5 shows representative EPR spectra obtained from HL-60 cells treated with different concentrations of H2O2 in the presence of the spin trap 4-POBN. Unexpectedly, a 12-line spin adduct was observed. It had a concentration threshold of 20 μmH2O2 and was not detected at 2 μmor in the absence of H2O2. There was no concentration dependence above 20 μm. This signal has a configuration (aN1 = 14.95 G, aN2 = 1.56 G, aH = 1.85 G) that is compatible with the POBN/POBN⋅ adduct previously described in a cell-free system (37.McCormick M.L. Buettner G.R. Britigan B.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29265-29269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In addition, human MPO, H2O2, and POBN in the absence of cells generate a strong EPR signal identical to the one observed in the cells, and this can be blocked by methimazole (spectra not shown). In our studies with HL-60 cells, the radical depends upon the presence of POBN and H2O2, but it was eliminated if catalase (1000 units/ml) was present. This signal was not observed in the absence of cells. Using 3-carboproxyl standards, we estimate that the maximal concentration of the POBN/POBN⋅ adduct is 60–80 nm. HL-60 cells studied in RPMI 1640 alone or normal saline without serum also generated the POBN/POBN⋅ when exposed to H2O2. It is not known whether the POBN⋅is a determinant of H2O2 cytotoxicity or a marker of a resultant oxidative event. In any case, the overall pattern of radical generation from increasing concentrations of H2O2 quantitatively paralleled that of apoptosis (Figs. 1 and 5), suggesting a relationship exists. We next studied human erythroblastic K562 cells, a line often used for comparison to HL-60 cells. When exposed to 20 μm H2O2 under identical conditions as the HL-60 cell, there was no generation of POBN/POBN⋅ adduct by the K562 cells; however, a small carbon-centered radical consistent with a lipid-derived radical was detected (47.North J.A. Spector A.A. Buettner G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5743-5746Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 48.Wagner B.A. Buettner G.R. Burns C.P. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 711-713PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). A loss of the ability to generate POBN⋅ was also noted in a high passaged HL-60 cell line referred to as spent HL-60 cells. This latter observation provides a particularly appropriate comparison, because the spent HL-60 line has the same lineage as the HL-60 line. TableI shows the activity of the major antioxidant enzymes in the three cell types. There were few statistically significant differences. The content of Mn-SOD was higher in the HL-60 cells than that of the K562 (p = 0.005) cells but not of the spent HL-60 cells. Likewise, the cellular content of catalase was significantly higher in the HL-60 cells compared with K562 (p = 0.0001) and spent HL-60 cells (p = 0.0002). However, these differences were small, and except for the small differences in catalase, they were not corroborated by statistical analysis when expressed as activity per cell number rather than per milligram of protein. Thus, it seems unlikely that antioxidant enzymes explain the differences in radical generation or the apoptosis observations.Table IAntioxidant enzyme activity of the cellsEnzymeActivityHL-60K562Spent HL-60SOD,aIn this assay, 1 unit of SOD activity corr"
https://openalex.org/W2100353665,"We previously reported that expression of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin induces apoptosis via c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) activation in HN33 cells (Liu, Y. F. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 28873–28822). Extending this study, we now demonstrate a role of mixed-lineage kinase 2 (MLK2), a JNK activator, in polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin-mediated neuronal toxicity. We find that normal huntingtin interacts with MLK2, whereas the polyglutamine expansion interferes with this interaction. Similar to the expression of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin, expression of MLK2 also induces JNK activation and apoptosis in HN33 cells. Co-expression of dominant negative MLK2 significantly attenuates neuronal apoptosis induced by the mutated huntingtin. Furthermore, over-expression of the N terminus of normal huntingtin partially rescues the neuronal toxicity induced by MLK2. Our results suggest that activation of MLK2-mediated signaling cascades may be partially involved in neuronal death induced by polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin. We previously reported that expression of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin induces apoptosis via c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) activation in HN33 cells (Liu, Y. F. (1998) J. Biol.

Huntington's disease mixed lineage kinase 2 c-Jun amino-terminal kinase(s) mitogen-activated protein kinase 7 stress-signaling kinase 1 polymerase chain reaction glutathione S-transferase Tdt-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling immunoprecipitation Huntington's disease (HD)1 is a neurodegenerative disorder with dominant inheritance (2.Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research GroupCell. 1993; 72: 971-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7118) Google Scholar). The disease is characterized by choreiform movement, mental impairment, and cognitive symptoms (3.Martin J.B. Gusella J.F. N. Engl. J.

The HD gene encodes a 350-kDa protein designated as huntingtin (2.Huntington's Disease Collaborative Research GroupCell. 1993; 72: 971-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7118) Google Scholar), which is ubiquitously expressed with the highest levels being found in the brain, lung, and testes (5.Trottier Y.

Immunocytochemistry reveals that in neurons huntingtin is a cytoplasmic protein found in cell bodies, dendrites, and also in nerve terminals, where huntingtin is associated with synaptic vesicles and microtubule complexes (6.Fusco F.R. Chen Q. Lamoreaux W. Figueredo-Cardenas G. Jiao Y. Coffiman J.A. Surmerier D.J. Honig M.G. Carlock L.R. Reiner A. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1189-1202Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Gutekunst C.-A.

The defect in the HD gene causes an expansion of a polyglutamine stretch near the N terminus of huntingtin, and the length of the polyglutamine repeat is correlated with the age of onset and the severity of the disease (8.Stine O.C. Pleasant N. Franz M.L. Abbott M.H. Folstein S.E. Ross C.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1547-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). To date, the normal function of huntingtin remains to be determined, and the molecular mechanism underlying neuronal death in HD is poorly understood. In previous studies, we found that expression of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin caused neuronal apoptosis via activation of JNKs in HN33 cells, a hippocampal neuron-derived cell line (1.Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28873-28877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanism by which polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin activates JNKs and induces neuronal apoptosis. Huntingtin contains multiple proline-rich motifs that may bind to both SH3 and WW domain-containing proteins (9.Sudol M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1469-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the N-terminal proline-rich region, which is about 40 amino acids long, is adjacent to the polyglutamine stretch. This proline-rich region has been shown to bind to both SH3 and WW domain-containing proteins (10.Liu Y.F. Deth R.C. Devys D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8121-8124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 11.Sitter A. Wälter S. Wedemeyer N. Hasenbank R. Scherzinger E. Eickhoff H. Bates G.P. Lehrach H.

Genet. 1998; 7: 1463-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). MLK2 is a member of the mixed-lineage kinase family whose kinase domain shows structural features of both tyrosine-specific and serine/threonine-specific protein kinases (13.Dorow D.S. Devereux L. Tu G.-F. Price G. Nicholl J.K. Sutherland G.R. Simpson R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). MLK2 possesses an SH3 domain that is homologous to the SH3 domains of Grb2 (13.Dorow D.S. Devereux L. Tu G.-F. Price G. Nicholl J.K. Sutherland G.R. Simpson R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). MLK2 is predominantly expressed in the brain (13.Dorow D.S. Devereux L. Tu G.-F. Price G. Nicholl J.K. Sutherland G.R. Simpson R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 234: 492-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), and it has been reported that MLK2 can directly bind and mediate activation of MKK7 and SEK1, which in turn induces JNK activation (14.Nagata K.

At moderate expression levels, MLK2 appears to selectively activate JNKs and has little effect on other mitogen-activated protein kinases (14.Nagata K. Puls A. Futter C. Aspenstrom P. Schaefer E.

Thus, MLK2 is a potential candidate for the involvement in JNK activation and neuronal toxicity induced by polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin. The current study was undertaken to investigate the role of MLK2 in mutated huntingtin-mediated neuronal toxicity. Our results suggest that huntingtin binds to the SH3 domain of MLK2 and the polyglutamine expansion interferes with its binding to the kinase. Activation of MLK2-mediated signal transduction pathways may be involved in initiating neuronal death in HD. HN33 cells, an immortalized rat hippocampal neuronal cell line (1.Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28873-28877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and 293T cells, human embryonic kidney cells expressing SV40 large T antigen, were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum on 10-cm plates. HN33 or 293T cells at 50 to 60% confluence were washed once with serum-free medium prior to transfection. Transfection was performed using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to manufacturer instructions. 10–50 μg of plasmid with 10–20 μl of Lipofectin/10-cm plate was used in transfection experiments. 48–72 h after transfection, 293T cells were harvested and lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer, and co-immunoprecipitation experiments were conducted as described previously using an anti-huntingtin's N terminus antibody 437 (10.Liu Y.F. Deth R.C. Devys D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8121-8124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) or anti-c-Myc-tagged antibody 9E10 (Santa Cruz). Human brain tissues were obtained from Dr. J.-P. Vonsattel or Human Brain Bank at McLean Hospital, Boston, MA with institutional review board approval. Post-mortem time was between 10–12 h. The diagnosis of HD was confirmed with neuropathological and genetic phenotype analysis. Human cortex tissues from normal subjects or HD patients were homogenized in detergent-free lysis buffer, and Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 1%. The mixture was then incubated at 4 °C with constant shaking for 1–2 h, and insoluble fractions were removed by centrifugation. Huntingtin N-terminal GST fusion protein constructs were generated by subcloning of a cDNA fragment encoding the first three exons of the HD gene containing 16 or 56 CAG repeats into pGEX2T. Construct for MLK2 C terminus (amino acids 407–953) GST fusion proteins was a generous gift of Dr. Alan Hall (University College London, London, UK) (14.Nagata K. Puls A. Futter C. Aspenstrom P. Schaefer E. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). The MLK2 SH3 domain cDNA fragment was amplified by reverse transcription-PCR and inserted into pGEX4T1. To generate MLK2 SH3-deficient GST fusion proteins, substitution of the first tryptophan at position 58 of the highly conserved tryptophan doublet of the SH3 domain to lysine was achieved by overlapping extension using PCR with mutated oligonucleotides. Such a substitution eliminates the ability of SH3 domains to bind to proline-rich ligands (10.Liu Y.F. Deth R.C. Devys D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8121-8124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Expression and purification of different MLK2 or huntingtin GST fusion proteins was performed as described previously, and ∼0.1 μg of GST fusion protein was used for in vitro binding studies. The full-length c-Myc-tagged MLK2 was a gift from Dr. Alan Hall (14.Nagata K. Puls A. Futter C. Aspenstrom P. Schaefer E. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). A kinase-dead version of MLK2 was generated by introduction of an Ala-Gly point mutation at position 651 (codon AAG to GAG) by overlapping PCR extension with mutated oligonucleotides, to result in an amino acid substitution of Lys to Glu at the ATP binding loop of the kinase domain. To generate an expression vector for huntingtin's N terminus with 16 CAG repeats, a cDNA fragment was excised from pFL16HD with NotI andSphI and subcloned into pcDNA 1.1 (Invitrogen). 16 h after transfection, HN33 cells were lysed with 1% Triton X-100 lysis buffer (1.Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28873-28877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). JNK was assayed as described previously (1.Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28873-28877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). For TUNEL assay, HN33 cells were plated on a slide culture chamber. After transfection, cells were fixed at the time indicated in the figures, and TUNEL staining was performed as described previously (1.Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28873-28877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Most apoptotic HN33 cells were detached from the slides, and TUNEL stain was performed on remaining attached cells. TUNEL stain-negative cells (living cells) were counted in the 20× power field in four different locations on the slides and ∼600–800 cells were counted in the control (1.Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28873-28877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). 293T cells, which are rich in huntingtin (10.Liu Y.F. Deth R.C. Devys D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8121-8124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), were utilized to study the interaction of huntingtin with MLK2. c-Myc-tagged MLK2 was transiently expressed in 293T cells, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with 437, an anti-huntingtin N-terminal antibody (10.Liu Y.F. Deth R.C. Devys D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8121-8124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), and the resulting blot was probed with 9E10, an anti-c-Myc-tagged monoclonal antibody. MLK2 was detected in 437 and 9E10 immunoprecipitates of lysates transfected with c-Myc-tagged MLK2 but not in the negative controls, 9E10 or 437 immunoprecipitates of wild-type or vector-transfected 293T cell lysates (Fig.1 A). Conversely, we also found that huntingtin protein was present in 9E10 immunoprecipitates of c-Myc-tagged MLK2-transfected 293T cell lysates but not wild-type or vector-transfected lysates (Fig. 1 B). These data show that MLK2 is associated with huntingtin in intact cells. Next, we examined the interaction of MLK2 with huntingtin in a hippocampal neuronal cell line, HN33 cells in which we found that expression of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin induced apoptosis (1.Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28873-28877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). MLK2 is richly expressed in HN33 cells, and the amount of MLK2 proteins in the cell is similar to that of 293T cells over-expressing c-Myc-tagged MLK2 (Fig. 1 C). HN33 cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with 437 or 4C8, a well characterized anti-huntingtin monoclonal antibody (5.Trottier Y. Devys D. Imbert G. Saudou F. An I. Lutz Y. Weber C. Agid Y. Hirsch E.C. Mandel J.L. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), and the resulting blot was probed with a specific anti-MLK2 antibody that has been characterized previously (20.Phelan D.R. Loveland K.L. Devereux L. Dorow D.S. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1999; 52: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 B, both 437 and 4C8 were able to precipitate MLK2 from HN33 cell lysates, whereas the peptide-antigen pre-absorbed 437 failed to do so. These data provide further evidence that normal huntingtin is associated with MLK2 in neuronal cells. To determine whether the SH3 domain of MLK2 mediates its interaction with huntingtin, we investigated the binding of huntingtin to a GST MLK2-SH3 domain fusion protein, whereas a GST MLK2 C terminus fusion protein, which lacks the SH3 domain, served as a negative control. As shown in Fig. 1 D, huntingtin binds to the MLK2 SH3 domain but not GST alone or the MLK2 C terminus. To verify whether the SH3 domain of MLK2 mediates its interaction with huntingtin, we generated a MLK2-SH3 domain-deficient GST fusion protein by substitution of the first tryptophan of the highly conserved tryptophan doublet of the MLK2 SH3 domain to lysine. Mutation of the tryptophan doublet of the SH3 domain is known to eliminate its ability to bind to proline-rich ligands (10.Liu Y.F. Deth R.C. Devys D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8121-8124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Huntingtin failed to bind to MLK2-SH3 domain-deficient GST fusion proteins (Fig. 1 D). These data show that the SH3 domain of MLK2 mediates its interaction with normal huntingtin. We next determined whether expansion of the polyglutamine repeat in huntingtin would alter its interaction with MLK2. The N-terminal proline-rich region adjacent to the polyglutamine repeat has been reported to bind to SH3 domain-containing proteins (10.Liu Y.F. Deth R.C. Devys D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8121-8124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 11.Sitter A. Wälter S. Wedemeyer N. Hasenbank R. Scherzinger E. Eickhoff H. Bates G.P. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 427-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Thus, we examined the binding of MLK2 to huntingtin's N terminus containing either a normal or expanded polyglutamine stretch. GST fusion proteins of huntingtin's N terminus containing 16 or 56 polyglutamine repeats were generated and purified. These GST fusion proteins were utilized as a template to examine whether huntingtin's N terminus is responsible for its interaction with MLK2 and how expansion of the polyglutamine repeat affects this interaction. As shown in Fig. 2 A, MLK2 binds to huntingtin's N terminus containing 16 polyglutamine repeats. Because the N-terminal proline region is the only potential SH3 domain binding site in this small N-terminal segment of huntingtin and others have shown that this region mediates huntingtin binding to SH3 domain (11.Sitter A. Wälter S. Wedemeyer N. Hasenbank R. Scherzinger E. Eickhoff H. Bates G.P. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 427-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), these data suggest that the N-terminal proline region is involved in huntingtin interaction with MLK2. The amount of c-Myc-tagged MLK2 bound to huntingtin's N terminus with 56 polyglutamine repeats was significantly reduced, about 70% less than that associated with the N terminus of normal huntingtin (Fig. 2 A). This data indicates that expansion of the polyglutamine repeat may inhibit the ability of huntingtin's N terminus to interact with the SH3 domain of MLK2. Next, we examined the interaction of MLK2 with huntingtin in the human brain. Because our MLK2 antibody cannot be used for immunoprecipitation, a MLK2 SH3 domain GST fusion protein was used to test the ability of normal and polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin proteins from human brain tissues to bind to MLK2. Lysates of human brain cortex tissues from a normal subject and a mid-age onset HD patient were prepared. Wild-type or mutated MLK2 SH3 domain GST fusion protein was incubated with human brain lysates, and the resulting blot was probed with 437. As shown in Fig. 2 B, normal huntingtin protein from normal or HD human cortex tissues bound to the wild-type MLK2 SH3 GST fusion protein but not to GST alone or to the MLK2 SH3 domain-deficient GST fusion protein. In contrast, polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin protein from the HD patient brain only weakly bound to the SH3 domain of MLK2 (Fig. 2 B). These data further support our findings that normal huntingtin binds to the SH3 domain of MLK2 and that the polyglutamine expansion interferes with its ability to interact with the SH3 domain of the kinase. MLK2 is known to induce JNK activation in Cos-1 cells (14.Nagata K. Puls A. Futter C. Aspenstrom P. Schaefer E. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether expression of MLK2 activates JNKs in HN33 cells. The MLK2 expression vector (pRK5) or vector alone was transiently transfected into HN33 cells. JNKs were precipitated using a GST·c-Jun protein, and an in vitro JNK assay was performed. An equal amount of JNK proteins were precipitated in each JNK assay (data not shown). As observed in other neuronal cells (21.Schwarzschild M.A. Cole R.L. Hyman S.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3455-3466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), a basal level of JNK activity was found in HN33 cells (Fig.3 A). MLK2 induced constitutive activation of JNKs in HN33 cells. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the level of the JNK activity was increased by 8-fold (Fig. 3, Aand B). Because MLK2 mediates JNK activation via phosphorylation and activation of both MKK7 and SEK1 (14.Nagata K. Puls A. Futter C. Aspenstrom P. Schaefer E. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 15.Hirai S. Katoh M. Terada M. Kyriakis J.M. Zon L.I. Rana A. Avruch J. Ohno S. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 7406-7412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we determined whether co-expression of dominant negative MKK7 and SEK1 could block MLK2-mediated JNK activation. As shown in Fig.3 A, MLK2-mediated JNK activation was significantly attenuated by co-expression of dominant negative MKK7 and SEK1 but not by co-expression of wild-type MKK7 and SEK1, which had little effect on the JNK activity induced by MLK2 (Fig. 3, A andB). Co-expression of wild-type MKK7 and SEK1 did not significantly alter basal JNK activity in HN33 cells (Fig. 3,A and B), whereas co-expression of dominant negative MKK7 and SEK1 inhibited basal JNK activity, which is toxic to HN33 cells (see below Fig. 3 D). We have reported that expression of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin induces neuronal apoptosis by activation of JNKs in HN33 cells (1.Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28873-28877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Because MLK2 also activates JNKs in HN33 cells, we examined whether expression of MLK2 induced neuronal toxicity in HN33 cells. Vector alone or c-Myc-tagged MLK2 was transiently expressed in HN33 cells and, 24 and 48 h post-transfection, cells were fixed and Tdt-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining, which detects the late stage of apoptosis, was conducted. TUNEL-negative cells (living cells) were counted. Expression of MLK2 induced rapid apoptotic cell death in HN33 cells (Fig. 3 C). HN33 cells started to undergo apoptosis at ∼24 h post-transfection (Fig. 3 C). At 48 h post-transfection, most HN33 cells were detached from the plate (apoptotic), and remaining attached cells were also apoptotic (Fig.3 C). Similar to expression of polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin (1.Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28873-28877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), expression of MLK2 not only led to neuronal death of transfected HN33 cells but also mediated cell toxicity of non-transfected HN33 cells, suggesting that activation of MLK2 may cause the release of cellular diffusible factors that are toxic to neighboring neuronal cells (1.Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28873-28877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Next, we investigated whether co-expression of dominant negative MKK7 and SEK1 would inhibit MLK2-mediated neuronal toxicity. Expression of wild-type or dominant negative mutant forms of MKK7 or SEK1 alone did not alter cell viability (1.Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28873-28877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Co-expression of wild-type SEK1 and MKK7 also did not generate any cell toxicity (Fig. 3 D), whereas co-expression of dominant negative SEK1 and MKK7 significantly attenuated neuronal toxicity induced by MLK2. As shown in Fig.3 D, ∼75% of HN33 cells were rescued upon co-expression of the dominant negative mutant form of MKK7 and SEK1. These data indicate that JNK-mediated neuronal toxicity is induced by MLK2 in HN33 cells. Co-expression of dominant negative MKK7 and SEK1 without MLK2 caused rapid apoptosis in HN33 cells (Fig. 3 D). Inhibition of basal JNK activity may account for this cell toxicity, because co-expression of dominant negative MKK7 and SEK1 decreased basal JNK activity in HN33 cells (Fig. 3, A and B), whereas when these two mutated kinases were co-expressed with MLK2 in HN33 cells, JNK activity was double the basal level (Fig. 3, A and B), and under this condition HN33 cells were viable (Fig. 3 D). These results suggest that a certain basal level of JNK activity appears to be essential for the survival of HN33 cells, and either over-activation or inhibition of basal JNK activity triggers apoptosis. To further investigate whether MLK2-mediated signaling cascades are involved in neuronal death induced by polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin, a dominant negative (kinase-dead) form of MLK2, which is known to competitively inhibit the endogenous kinase, was generated. Different full-length huntingtin expression vectors containing 16, 48, or 89 polyglutamine repeats were separately co-transfected with wild-type or the dominant negative form of MLK2 into HN33 cells. As shown in Fig. 4 A, co-expression of dominant negative MLK2 significantly inhibited neuronal toxicity mediated by polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin in HN33 cells. At 48 h post-transfection of the huntingtin construct containing 48 or 89 CAG repeats, over 75% of HN33 cells remained viable (i.e. trypan blue stain-negative) when dominant negative MLK2 is co-expressed, compared with 70–80% of apoptotic cells when the mutated huntingtin was expressed alone (Fig.4 A). These data further support a role for MLK2 in the mediation of neuronal toxicity induced by polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin. Our data show that the N-terminal proline-rich region of huntingtin interacts with MLK2, and the polyglutamine expansion interferes with this interaction. These results suggest that the polyglutamine expansion may lead to an increase in free MLK2 proteins, which are constitutively active and cell toxic (14.Nagata K. Puls A. Futter C. Aspenstrom P. Schaefer E. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). If this hypothesis is true, over-expression of the N terminus of normal huntingtin, which binds to free MLK2 proteins, should be able to overcome the neuronal toxicity induced by MLK2 and polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin. We prepared a construct encoding a small region of the normal huntingtin N terminus, containing a 16 polyglutamine repeat and the proline-rich region. As shown in Fig. 4 B, co-expression of this N-terminal fragment of normal huntingtin significantly attenuated neuronal toxicity mediated by MLK2 and by the mutated huntingtin with 48 polyglutamine repeats. Over 50% of neurons remained viable at 48 h post-transfection, compared with less than 20% of viable cells when the N-terminal fragment was not co-expressed (Fig. 4 B). These studies support our hypothesis that the polyglutamine expansion in huntingtin may interfere with its interaction with MLK2 thereby leading to an increase of free MLK2 proteins that in turn mediate JNK activation and neuronal apoptosis. In the present study, we demonstrate that MLK2, an upstream activator of the JNK pathway, is involved in JNK activation and neuronal apoptosis mediated by polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin (1.Liu Y.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28873-28877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The polyglutamine expansion decreases the association of huntingtin with MLK2 leading to an increase in unregulated MLK2 proteins that, being constitutively active, cause JNK activation and neuronal toxicity. Co-expression of dominant negative MKK7 and SEK1, the downstream effectors of MLK2, blocks JNK activation and neuronal apoptosis induced by MLK2 and by polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin. Additionally, co-expression of dominant negative MLK2 significantly attenuated JNK activation and neuronal toxicity mediated by the polyglutamine expanded huntingtin. Finally, over-expression of a normal huntingtin N-terminal protein significantly attenuated neuronal toxicity induced by both MLK2 and polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin. These results show that MLK2-mediated cellular signaling cascades may play a significant role in neuronal death induced by polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin in HN33 cells. Because huntingtin is a ubiquitously expressed protein, whereas the pathology of HD is restricted to the brain, it is likely that huntingtin binds to proteins that are largely found in the brain, and the polyglutamine expansion alters huntingtin's ability to interact with these proteins thereby resulting in activation of neurotoxic pathways. MLK2 being almost exclusively expressed in the brain could provide a partial explanation for why the polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin is selectively toxic to neurons. MLK2 is a strong activator of the JNK pathway that is now known to couple a variety of cell-toxic stimuli, leading to neuronal apoptosis (21.Schwarzschild M.A. Cole R.L. Hyman S.E. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3455-3466Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22.Eilers A. Whitfield J. Banij C. Rubin L.L. Ham J. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 1713-1724Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because MLK2 is a constitutively active kinase, and free MLK2 is the active form (14.Nagata K. Puls A. Futter C. Aspenstrom P. Schaefer E. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar), any alteration of the amount of bound MLK2 is likely to lead to activation of MLK2-mediated signaling cascades and neuronal toxicity. We show that normal huntingtin proteins from normal or HD human cortex tissues specifically bind to wild-type but not the mutated SH3 domain of MLK2, and under the same conditions, the mutated huntingtin proteins from HD patient cortex tissues only weakly bound to the SH3 domain of MLK2. Moreover, over-expression of the N terminus of normal huntingtin, which binds and decreases free MLK2 proteins in HN33 cells, can significantly inhibit neuronal toxicity induced by MLK2 and by the mutated huntingtin, further supporting the notion that huntingtin's N terminus interacts with the SH3 domain of MLK2, and the ability to bind to the kinase may be impaired upon polyglutamine expansion in huntingtin. The polyglutamine expansion apparently alters the physical properties of huntingtin. The mobility of the mutated huntingtin on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis is clearly decreased (5.Trottier Y. Devys D. Imbert G. Saudou F. An I. Lutz Y. Weber C. Agid Y. Hirsch E.C. Mandel J.L. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 104-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar), and huntingtin's N terminus protein carrying an expanded polyglutamine stretch forms amyloid-like protein aggregates both in vitroand in vivo (23.DiFiglia M. Sapp E. Chase K.O. Davies S.P. Bates G.P. Vonsattel J.P. Aronin N. Science. 1997; 277: 1990-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (2331) Google Scholar, 24.Scherzinger E. Lurz R. Turmaine M. Mangiarini L.

Because the N-terminal proline-rich region is adjacent to the polyglutamine stretch, it is possible that the polyglutamine expansion may alter the binding properties of this proline-rich region. Our group previously found that normal huntingtin is associated with epidermal growth factor receptor signaling complexes through binding to the SH3 domains of Grb2 and RasGAP, and this association is regulated by activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (10.Liu Y.F. Deth R.C. Devys D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8121-8124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Recently, other groups have also reported that huntingtin binds to Grb2-like SH3 domain-containing proteins, and the N-terminal proline-rich region mediates these interactions (10.Liu Y.F. Deth R.C. Devys D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8121-8124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 11.Sitter A. Wälter S. Wedemeyer N. Hasenbank R. Scherzinger E. Eickhoff H. Bates G.P. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 427-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Our results from the current study are consistent with these reports (10.Liu Y.F. Deth R.C. Devys D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8121-8124Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 11.Sitter A. Wälter S. Wedemeyer N. Hasenbank R. Scherzinger E. Eickhoff H. Bates G.P. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Mol. Cell. 1998; 2: 427-436Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In addition, we show that the ability of this proline-rich region to bind to the SH3 domain of MLK2 is impaired upon expansion of the polyglutamine stretch. The interaction of proline-rich motifs with SH3 domains is not a highly selective event (9.Sudol M. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1469-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Thus, if the polyglutamine expansion in huntingtin interferes with its interaction with the SH3 domain of MLK2, it may inhibit its association with other SH3 domain-containing proteins. Perhaps the normal function of huntingtin is the modulation of the cellular signaling network by sequestering these SH3 domain-containing signaling proteins. When the ability of huntingtin to interact with SH3 domains is impaired, polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin may be disassociated from the microtubule complex where most SH3 domain-containing proteins are found, leading to the re-arrangement of SH3 domain-containing protein-associated signaling complexes, which may subsequently result in an imbalance of cellular signaling networks and neuronal death. Incidentally, huntingtin's N terminus with an expanded length of polyglutamine repeat forms nuclear inclusions in the brains of HD patients or in cultured cells (25.Saudou F. Finkbeiner S. Deys D. Greenberg M.E. Cell. 1998; 95: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1371) Google Scholar), indicating that some mutated huntingtin proteins are translocated and no longer co-present with MLK2 or other SH3 domain-containing proteins in the cytoplasm. It is clear now that striatal medium-spiny neurons, which die first in HD, lack endogenous huntingtin. Thus, diffusible neurotoxic factors may play an important role in early neuronal loss in HD. Our previous studies and current results are consistent with this notion; expression of the mutated huntingtin or MLK2 induces not only apoptotic cell death of transfected HN33 cells but also non-transfected cells. Because JNK activation has been reported to mediate free radical production (26.Go Y.M. Patel R.P. Maland M.C. Park H. Beckman J.S. Darley-Usmar V.M. Jo H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: H1647-H1653PubMed Google Scholar), it is possible that polyglutamine-expanded huntingtin may mediate free radical production via activation of the MLK2-JNK pathway. In summary, our current studies show that activation of MLK2-mediated signaling cascades may be partially responsible for neuronal loss in HD, and an inhibitor of MLK2 may be useful for the prevention of neuronal loss in HD.

The three subunits of laminins, designated α, β, and γ chains, form the well known cross-shaped structure linked together by disulfide bonds. Five α, three β, and three γ chains and at least 12 structural isoforms of laminin (laminin-1 to -12) having distinct chain combinations have been identified in human thus far (3.Miner J.H.

Among these laminin isoforms, laminin-5, which consists of the laminin α3, β3, and γ2 chains, is unique in the structure and biological activity. Laminin-5 was originally found as a keratinocyte-derived matrix protein named epiligrin, kalinin, or nicein (5.Carter W.G. Ryan M.C. Gahr P.J.

Laminin-5 has a feature lacking some domains found in the amino-terminal regions (or the short arms) of the three subunits of other laminin isoforms (2.Aumailley M. Rousselle P.

The laminin α3 chain is found in laminin-6 (α3β1γ1) and laminin-7 (α3β2γ1) besides laminin-5, but the laminin β3 and γ2 chains are found only in laminin-5. More interestingly, laminin-5 has much higher activity to promote adhesion, migration, and scattering of various types of cells than laminin-1, fibronectin, and vitronectin (8.Miyazaki K. Kikkawa Y.

Most cultured cell lines utilize integrin α3β1 as a major receptor to adhere and migrate on the laminin-5 substrate, but integrins α6β4 and α6β1also act as the additional receptors of laminin-5 depending on cell types (5.Carter W.G.

The interaction of laminin-5 with integrin α6β4in the hemidesmosome structures is essential for the stable anchorage of basal epithelial cells to the underlying connective tissues. Defects of laminin-5 genes cause Herlitz-type junctional epidermolysis bullosa (H-JEB), which is characterized by splitting of epidermal/dermal junctions (12.Aberdam D. Galliano M.-F. Vailly J.

For understanding the molecular basis for the unique bifunctional properties of laminin-5, the stable adhesion and motility, it seems important to clarify its structural and functional relationship. All laminin α chains have a large carboxyl-terminal globular domain consisting of a tandem array of five small globular domains (or modules) (G1 to G5) (1.Timple R. Curr. Opin.

Our previous study with recombinant G domains of the laminin α3 chain has shown that the G2 domain contains an integrin α3β1-binding site, and the G4 and G5 domains weakly interact with heparan sulfate proteoglycans (24.Mizushima H. Takamura H. Miyagi Y. Kikkawa Y. Yamanaka N. Yasumitsu H. Misugi K. Miyazaki K. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 979-987PubMed Google Scholar). To clarify the functions of the G domains of the laminin α3 chain, we have prepared recombinant laminin-5 proteins serially lacking G domains of the α3 chain, and we examined their activities to promote cell adhesion and motility. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against human laminin α3 chain were established in our laboratory with the support of Eiken Chemical (Tokyo, Japan). These antibodies were raised against the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of the amino-terminal region of human laminin α3 chain (amino acid residues 109–331). One of these antibodies, LSα3c4, was used for immunoaffinity purification of recombinant laminin-5 proteins. Monoclonal antibody against human laminin γ2 chain (D4B5) was described previously (11.Mizushima H. Koshikawa N. Moriyama K. Takamura H. Nagashima Y. Hirahara F. Miyazaki K. Hormone Res. 1998; 50 Suppl. 2: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 25.Koshikawa N. Moriyama K. Takamura H. Mizushima H. Nagashima Y. Yanoma S. Miyazaki K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5596-5601PubMed Google Scholar). Rabbit polyclonal antibody (α3G4) was raised against the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of the G4 domain of human laminin α3 chain (amino acid residues 1335–1552), which included the carboxyl-terminal 19 amino acid residues of the G3 domain besides the complete G4 sequence. Monoclonal antibody against human laminin β3 chain was purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). Function-blocking antibodies against integrins used are anti-α2-integrin antibody P1E6, anti-α3-integrin antibody P1B5, and anti-β1-integrin antibody P4C10 from Life Technologies, Inc., (Gaithersburg, MD) anti-α5-integrin antibody P1D6 from Chemicon (Temecula, CA), and anti-α6-integrin antibody G0H3 from PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080 and human tongue squamous adenocarcinoma cell line C-4I were obtained from Japanese Cancer Resources Bank. Buffalo rat liver-derived epithelial cell line has been used in previous studies (8.Miyazaki K. Kikkawa Y. Nakamura A. Yasumitsu H. Umeda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11767-11771Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9.Kikkawa Y. Umeda M. Miyazaki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These cell lines were cultured in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F12 medium (DME/F12)1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS), penicillin, and streptomycin sulfate. Human laminin α3 chain cDNA has been cloned from a cDNA library of gastric cancer cells (25.Koshikawa N. Moriyama K. Takamura H. Mizushima H. Nagashima Y. Yanoma S. Miyazaki K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5596-5601PubMed Google Scholar). pGEM-LS/CX, a plasmid vector pGEM3Zf(+) (Promega, Madison, WI) encoding a full-length laminin α3 chain, was prepared in this study. A series of carboxyl-terminal cDNA fragments of the laminin α3 chain were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the laminin α3 chain cDNA as a template and ligated into the pGEM-3zf(+) vector. PCR primers used were as follows: G4–5′, 5′-CTGGATCCCTGTTGCAGGACACA-3′ (nucleotides 4003–4017, sense); G4X-3′, 5′-CGTCTAGATCAGTGAGCCAAGACGAC-3′ (nucleotides 4642–4656, antisense); G3–5′, 5′-CAGGATCCAGTGGTGTCGTTAGA-3′ (nucleotides 3445–3459, sense); G3X-3′, 5′-GGTCTAGATCATCCATGATTGGCCTG-3′ (nucleotides 4081–4095, antisense); G2–5′, 5′-CAGGATCCGTTCTGAGCTTGTAC-3′ (nucleotides 2851–2865, sense); G2X-3′, 5′-CCTCTAGATCAGGAGAATGAGGCAGA-3′ (nucleotides 3445–3459, antisense); G1–5′, 5′-CGGAATTCTGCCAAATGACCTG-3′ (nucleotides 2347–2361, sense); G1X-3′, 5′-GGTCTAGATCAAGCATAGCCCGTACC-3′ (nucleotides 2953–2967, antisense); LSp-14, 5′-GATGAGCTGGTGCGCTG-3′ (nucleotides 1636–1652, sense); and I/II X-3′, 5′-GGTCTAGACTATCCAAGGTACATCAC-3′ (nucleotides 2446–2460, antisense), in which the underlines indicate restriction sites for subcloning. Each reverse primer included a stop codon followed by aXbaI site. The sense primers except for LSp-14 were used in a previous study (24.Mizushima H. Takamura H. Miyagi Y. Kikkawa Y. Yamanaka N. Yasumitsu H. Misugi K. Miyazaki K. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 979-987PubMed Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal fragments G4X, G3X, G2X, G1X, and I/II X were obtained by the following primer-combinations: G4–5′/G4X-3′, G3–5′/G3X-3′, G2–5′/G2X-3′, G1–5′/G1X-3′ and LSp-14/I/II X-3′, respectively. pGEM-ΔG5, pGEM-ΔG4–5, pGEM-ΔG3–5, pGEM-ΔG2–5, and pGEM-ΔG1–5 were generated by the insertion of a BstXI/SphI fragment of pGEM-G4X, a ClaI/SphI fragment of G3X, aXhoI/SphI fragment of G2X, aSalI/SphI fragment of G1X, and anEco52I/SphI fragment of I/II X into the corresponding restriction sites of pGEM-LS/CX, respectively. The plasmid constructs thus obtained encoded the following domains of the laminin α3 chain: ΔG5 (amino acid residues 1–1552, from IIIa to G4), ΔG4–5 (amino acid residues 1–1365, from IIIa to G3), ΔG3–5 (amino acid residues 1–1153, from IIIa to G2), ΔG2–5 (amino acid residues 1–989, from IIIa to G1), and ΔG1–5 (amino acid residues 1–820, from IIIa to I/II). All nucleotide sequences of the plasmid constructs were confirmed by sequence analysis. These cDNAs were subsequently cloned into the XbaI site of mammalian expression plasmid vector pEF-BOS-CITE-NEO2, a modified version of pEF-BOS-CITE-NEO (27.Miyata S. Miyagi Y. Koshikawa N. Nagashima Y. Kato Y. Yasumitsu H. Hirahara F. Misugi K. Miyazaki K. Clin. Exp. Metastasis. 1998; 16: 613-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Before cDNA transfection, HT1080 cells were cloned by the limiting dilution method. The cDNA expression plasmid vectors were transfected into a HT1080 cell clone by the calcium-phosphate precipitation method. Selection of stable transfectants and subsequent amplification of the introduced cDNAs were carried out with 500 μg/ml geneticin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Northern blotting analysis of the laminin α3, β3, and γ2 chains were performed by the method described previously (26.Mizushima H. Miyagi Y. Kikkawa Y. Yamanaka N. Yasumitsu H. Misugi K. Miyazaki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 1196-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) was performed on 6% gels under nonreducing or reducing conditions. Separated proteins were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. For immunoblotting, proteins separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. The three subunits of laminin-5 were detected by the alkaline phosphatase method with chain-specific antibodies. Adhesion of BRL cells or C-4I cells to purified laminin-5 proteins and extracellular matrices deposited by various HT1080 transfectants was assayed as described previously (24.Mizushima H. Takamura H. Miyagi Y. Kikkawa Y. Yamanaka N. Yasumitsu H. Misugi K. Miyazaki K. Cell Growth & Differ. 1997; 8: 979-987PubMed Google Scholar). To prepare the matrices, each transfectant clone of HT1080 cells (5 × 103 cells) was inoculated and incubated on 96-well plastic plates (Sumibe Medical, Tokyo, Japan) in DME/F12 medium containing 10% FCS at 37 °C for 4 days. Then the transfectant cells were detached from the plates by incubating with 100 μl of 10 mm EDTA in Ca2+- and Mg2+-free phosphate-buffered saline. Complete detachment of cells was confirmed under a microscopy. The plates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and blocked with 200 μl of 1.2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C for 1.5 h. These plates were used as the matrix-coated plates for the assay of cell adhesion. Cells adhered to the laminin-5 proteins or the HT1080 matrices were stained with Hoechst 33342 for 1.5 h, and the fluorescent intensity of each well was measured using a CytoFluor 2350 fluorometer (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Migration and scattering of BRL cells on purified laminin-5 proteins and extracellular matrices deposited by various HT1080 transfectants were assayed as reported previously (9.Kikkawa Y. Umeda M. Miyazaki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). For the cell migration assay, the matrices of HT1080 transfectants were prepared in 25-cm2tissue culture flasks (Beckton Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) as described above. Cell migration on these substrates was monitored at 37 °C with time-lapse video equipment in which a video camera (MKC-385; Olympus, Tokyo) was mounted on an inverted microscope (IX-70; Olympus) and connected to a time-lapse control unit (LVR-3000AN; Sony, Tokyo, Japan). The length of cell migration was measured with a video micrometer (VM-30; Olympus). Four transfectants of HT1080 cells were grown to confluence in roller bottles (Beckton Dickinson) with DME/F12 medium containing 10% FCS (200 ml/bottle). The confluent cultures were washed twice with and incubated in serum-free DME/F12 medium. The serum-free conditioned medium was harvested every 2 days, clarified by centrifugation, and subjected to protein precipitation with 80%-saturated ammonium sulfate. The precipitated proteins were dissolved in and dialyzed against 20 mmTris-HCl buffer containing 0.5 m NaCl, 0.01% (w/v) Brij35, and 0.1% (w/v) CHAPS and then applied to molecular sieve chromatography on a Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (8.Miyazaki K. Kikkawa Y. Nakamura A. Yasumitsu H. Umeda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11767-11771Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Fractions containing laminin-5 were pooled and subjected to immunoaffinity chromatography with the anti-laminin-α3 monoclonal antibody (LSα3c4). Bound proteins were eluted from the affinity column with 0.05% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and immediately neutralized with 1/3 volume of 1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). The eluted laminin-5 fractions were further purified by immunoaffinity chromatography with the anti-laminin-γ2 monoclonal antibody (D4B5). The recombinant laminin-5 proteins thus purified were stored at 4 °C in the presence of 0.005% Brij35 and 0.1% CHAPS. To assess the contribution of the five G domains of the laminin α3 chain to the cell adhesion and cell motility activities of laminin-5, we tried to prepare recombinant laminin-5 variants serially lacking G domains. Human fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080, which expresses the laminin β3 and γ2 chains but not the α3 chain (26.Mizushima H. Miyagi Y. Kikkawa Y. Yamanaka N. Yasumitsu H. Misugi K. Miyazaki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 1196-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), was chosen as the recipient cells to transfect the α3 chain cDNAs. Expression vectors containing the cDNAs for wild type (WT) and the following five deletion derivatives of human laminin α3 chain were constructed: the α3 chains without G5 (ΔG5); without G4 and G5 (ΔG4–5); without G3, G4, and G5 (ΔG3–5); without G2, G3, G4, and G5 (ΔG2–5); and without any G domains (ΔG1–5) (Fig. 1). These expression vectors and the control vector without any α3 chain cDNA were transfected into HT1080 cells, and stable transfectant clones were isolated. When cell morphology and growth rate were compared among the HT1080 transfectants, the difference is not evident between the control and cDNA transfectants under usual serum-containing culture conditions. However, when incubated in serum-free culture medium, HT1080 transfectants of WT, ΔG5, and ΔG4–5survived much longer than the other cDNA transfectants and the control transfectant (data not shown). This suggested that the laminin-5 forms with G1–3 might prevent HT1080 cells from apoptosis in serum-free medium. Next, we examined gene expression of the three laminin-5 subunits in the control and cDNA transfectants of HT1080 cells by Northern blotting. As expected, all of the five transfectants of the α3 chain cDNAs expressed the α3 chain mRNA with different sizes at comparable levels, whereas the control transfectant expressed no positive signal (Fig. 2 A). In contrast, the laminin β3 and γ2 chain mRNAs were expressed in the control transfectant as well as the cDNA transfectants (Fig. 2,B and C). The transfection of the laminin α3 chain cDNAs did not affect the transcriptional levels of the β3 and γ2 chain genes in any clones. To examine the secretion of laminin-5 mutant proteins from HT1080 cells transfected with different laminin α3 chain cDNAs, the three laminin-5 subunits in the conditioned media of the transfectants were analyzed by Western blotting with the specific antibodies (Fig.3). When probed with the anti-α3 chain antibody, the conditioned media of the cDNA transfectants, but not the control transfectant, showed immunoreactive bands different in size (Fig. 3 A). HT1080/WT (transfectants of the full-length laminin α3) secreted a 190-kDa full-length α3 chain and a 160-kDa α3 chain (Fig. 3 A, lane 2), whereas HT1080/ΔG5 secreted 175- and 160-kDa α3 chains (Fig.3 A, lane 3). HT1080/ΔG4–5, HT1080/ΔG3–5, and HT1080/ΔG2–5 secreted a single α3 chain of 160, 140, and 120 kDa, respectively (Fig.3 A, lanes 4–6). On the other hand, HT1080/ΔG1–5, which lacked all G domains, secreted only a trace amount of 100-kDa α3 chain (Fig. 3 A, lane 7). We could not detect deposition of the α3 chain in the extracellular matrix or cell lysate of HT1080/ΔG1–5 (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2 A, this transfectant significantly expressed the α3 chain message. Therefore, it is considered that the G domains of the α3 chain are required for the assembly and subsequent secretion of the heterotrimer α3β3γ2. As described above, the HT1080 transfectants of WT, ΔG5, and ΔG4–5 secreted apparently the same size (160 kDa) of the α3 chain. It is known that the mature α3 chain of 190 kDa is proteolytically processed to the 160-kDa form (28.Marinkovich M.P. Lunstrum G.P. Keene D.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 695-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). When the conditioned media of the control HT1080, HT1080/WT, and HT1080/ΔG5 were analyzed by Western blotting with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against a recombinant G4 protein, the 190-kDa band in HT1080/WT and the 175-kDa band in HT1080/ΔG5 were clearly detected, whereas the 160-kDa band in both transfectants was scarcely detected by the antibody (Fig.4). Therefore, we judged the 160-kDa band as the α3 chain that had been proteolytically cleaved between the G3 and G4 domains. Western blotting analysis with the anti-β3 chain antibody detected almost a single band of the 135-kDa mature β3 chain in the conditioned media of all transfectants (Fig. 3 B). On the other hand, analysis with the anti-γ2 chain antibody detected the mature γ2 chain of 150 kDa and its proteolytically processed form of 105 kDa at relatively irregular intensity (Fig. 3 C). It is noteworthy that the control transfectant secreted significant amounts of the β3 and γ2 chains. This indicates that the secretion of the laminin β3 and γ2 chains does not depend on the co-expression of the α3 chain. To confirm the secretion of laminin-5, immunoprecipitation with the anti-laminin γ2 chain monoclonal antibody was carried out with the conditioned media of some HT1080 transfectants. The anti-γ2 chain antibody precipitated both the laminin α3 and β3 chains, as well as the laminin γ2 chain, from the conditioned media of transfectants of the laminin α3 cDNAs, indicating the formation of the heterotrimer of the α3, β3, and γ2 chains (data not shown). Interestingly, the non-processed forms of the laminin α3 chains were hardly precipitated from the conditioned media of HT1080/WT and HT1080/ΔG5, as compared with their processed forms (data not shown). To examine the cell adhesion activity of the laminin-5 deletion forms, the matrices deposited by HT1080 transfectants were tested with Buffalo rat liver cell line BRL, which has been used for the assays of cell scattering activity and cell adhesion activity of laminin-5 (8.Miyazaki K. Kikkawa Y. Nakamura A. Yasumitsu H. Umeda M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11767-11771Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 9.Kikkawa Y. Umeda M. Miyazaki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This cell line adheres not only to laminin-5 but also to fibronectin. When the relative amounts of the laminin α3 chain proteins deposited by HT1080 transfectants were determined using the anti-laminin-α3 antibody, all of the matrices except for the control and ΔG1–5 contained the laminin α3 chains at similar levels (data not shown). When the cell adhesion activity was assayed at 20 min after seeding, BRL cells attached and spread on the matrices of HT1080/WT, HT1080/ΔG5, and HT1080/ΔG4–5 but not on the matrices of the other transfectants (Fig. 5, closed columns). When assayed at 1 h after seeding, all of the matrices supported the adhesion of BRL cells at almost the same activity (Fig. 5, open columns). However, there was a morphological difference of BRL cells between the matrices from the transfectants of laminin α3 cDNAs with and without the G3 domain. BRL cells spread more on the matrices of WT, ΔG5, and ΔG4–5 than on those of the others (data not shown). It has previously been reported that the RGD peptide inhibits adhesion of BRL cells to fibronectin by about half but does not inhibit that to laminin-5 at all (9.Kikkawa Y. Umeda M. Miyazaki K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1994; 116: 862-869Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). When BRL cells were treated with a RGD-containing peptide (GRGDSP) or a control peptide (GRGESP), the cell adhesion to the ΔG3–5 matrix, but not that to the ΔG4–5 matrix, was effectively inhibited by the GRGDSP peptide (Fig. 6). This suggests that BRL cells preferentially attach to and spread on laminin-5 in the matrices of ΔG4–5, ΔG5, and WT, whereas they slowly attach to fibronectin or other cell adhesion proteins in the matrices of the other transfectants including ΔG3–5. This possibility was confirmed using the adhesion assay with human cervix epidermoid carcinoma cell line C-4I, which is able to adhere to laminin-5 but not fibronectin, vitronectin, or laminin-1. 2Y. Kikkawa and K. Miyazaki, unpublished data. When C-4I cells were seeded on the matrices of HT1080 transfectants, they effectively attached to and spread on only the matrices of WT, ΔG5, and ΔG4–5 even at 1.5 h after seeding (Fig.7). When effect of function-blocking anti-integrin antibodies was examined, antibodies to integrins α3 and β1 strongly inhibited the cell adhesion to the ΔG4–5 matrix and to purified laminin-5, indicating that C-4I cells had adhered to the laminin-5 deposited on the matrix through integrin α3β1(Table I). The anti-α6-integrin antibody weakly inhibited both cell adhesion to the ΔG4–5 matrix and to the purified laminin-5, but antibodies to integrins α2 and α5 rather stimulated the cell adhesion. All these results strongly suggested that the G3 domain of the laminin α3 chain is essential for the poten"
https://openalex.org/W2046702929,"Most G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), including the M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR), internalize in clathrin-coated vesicles, a process that requires dynamin GTPase. The observation that some GPCRs like the M2 mAChR and the angiotensin AT1A receptor (AT1AR) internalize irrespective of expression of dominant-negative K44A dynamin has led to the proposal that internalization of these GPCRs is dynamin-independent. Here, we report that, contrary to what is postulated, internalization of M2mAChR and AT1AR in HEK-293 cells is dynamin-dependent. Expression of N272 dynamin, which lacks the GTP-binding domain, or K535M dynamin, which is not stimulatable by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, strongly inhibits internalization of M1 and M2 mAChRs and AT1ARs. Expression of kinase-defective K298M c-Src or Y231F,Y597F dynamin (which cannot be phosphorylated by c-Src) reduces M1 mAChR internalization. Similarly, c-Src inhibitor PP1 as well as the generic tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein strongly inhibit M1 mAChR internalization. In contrast, M2 mAChR internalization is not (or is only slightly) reduced by expression of these constructs or treatment with PP1 or genistein. Thus, dynamin GTPases are not only essential for M1 mAChR but also for M2 mAChR and AT1AR internalization in HEK-293 cells. Our findings also indicate that dynamin GTPases are differentially regulated by c-Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation.

G protein-coupled receptor angiotensin AT1A receptor bovine serum albumin muscarinic acetylcholine receptor N-methylscopolamine phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate HEPES-buffered saline Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium For most G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs),1 receptor internalization is thought to be initiated by phosphorylation of the receptor by G protein-coupled receptor kinases and binding of the cytosolic protein β-arrestin to the phosphorylated receptor (1.Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). β-Arrestin then sterically inhibits further interaction of the receptor with heterotrimeric G proteins and binds with high affinity to clathrin heavy chains (1.Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). Through this interaction, GPCRs are believed to be targeted to clathrin-coated pits. Following transformation of the clathrin-coated pit into a clathrin-coated vesicle, the clathrin-coated vesicle pinches off from the plasma membrane. This process is catalyzed by the 100-kDa GTPase dynamin, which probably activates (as yet largely unknown) effectors of the fission machinery (2.Sever S. Muhlberg A.B. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1999; 398: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Three closely related mammalian dynamin isoforms have been identified: neuronal dynamin-1, ubiquitously expressed dynamin-2, and dynamin-3, which is expressed in testes, neurons, and lung (3.Schmid S.L. McNiven M.A. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Comparison of the primary sequence shows that all three dynamin isoforms contain three highly conserved GTP-binding motifs (i.e. elements I, II, and III). A Lys44 → Ala substitution in the first of the three putative GTP-binding motifs yields a dominant-negative dynamin mutant, which displays strongly impaired GTPase activity and is predicted to have a greatly reduced GTP binding affinity (4.Van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The two other GTP-binding motifs in dynamin are likely to be involved in GTP binding as well. Mutation of the third GTP-binding motif (substitution Lys206 → Asp in element III) or removal of all three GTP-binding motifs (amino acids 1–271 in dynamin-1) drastically reduces clathrin-coated vesicle-mediated internalization (4.Van der Bliek A.M.

Biol. 1999; 19: 1410-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar).A large number of recent studies indicate that most GPCRs, including M1, M3, and M4 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) in HEK-293 cells, internalize in clathrin-coated vesicles in a dynamin-dependent manner. This evidence is primarily based on the inhibitory effect of the dominant-negative inhibitor of dynamin-mediated internalization, K44A dynamin (10.Vögler O. Bogatkewitsch G.S. Wriske C.

In contrast, M2 mAChRs internalize in a clathrin-independent manner and irrespective of expression of K44A dynamin in HEK-293 cells (10.Vögler O. Bogatkewitsch G.S. Wriske C. Krummenerl P.

Likewise, internalization of angiotensin AT1A receptors (AT1ARs) (13.Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Ménard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar), dopamine D2 receptors (14.Vickery R.G. von Zastrow M. J.

Chem. 1999; 274: 31515-31523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) is also insensitive to expression of K44A dynamin. This has led to the proposal that internalization of these GPCRs is dynamin-independent. However, in light of the notion that the binding of GTP to dynamin probably involves binding to all three GTP- binding motifs in the GTP-binding pocket, we reasoned that a dynamin mutant lacking all three GTP-binding motifs might be a more appropriate dominant negative dynamin mutant to determine whether internalization of a particular GPCR is dynamin-dependent. Indeed, we here demonstrate that internalization of M2 mAChR and AT1AR is strongly inhibited by expression of N272 dynamin, which lacks the complete GTP-binding domain. Also, expression of K535M dynamin, which lacks PIP2-stimulated GTPase activity, significantly blocks internalization of these GPCR species.DISCUSSIONIn the past few years, the question whether dynamin plays an essential role in the internalization of a particular GPCR has been mostly analyzed by using K44A dynamin as dominant-negative mutant. While internalization of most GPCRs is blocked by expression of K44A dynamin, some GPCRs like the M2 mAChRs, D2dopamine receptors, secretin receptors, and AT1ARs internalize irrespective of K44A dynamin expression, suggesting that internalization of these GPCRs is dynamin-independent (10.Vögler O.

We now report that, contrary to what is currently postulated, internalization of M2 mAChR and AT1AR is dynamin-dependent. Coexpression of the dominant-negative dynamin mutants N272 and K535M strongly inhibited M2 mAChR and AT1AR internalization in HEK-293 tsA201 cells. These findings imply that N272 and K535M dynamin are more appropriate dominant-negative dynamin mutants than K44A dynamin. In this context, it will be interesting to determine whether fluid-phase endocytosis (5.Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar,20.Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar) and internalization of ricin (21.Simpson J.C. Smith D.C. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) are affected by expression of N272 or K535M dynamin also, because these trafficking processes are not blocked by K44A dynamin and are thus considered to be dynamin-independent. It is intriguing that N272 dynamin, which lacks all three GTP-binding motifs, inhibits internalization of both M1 and M2 mAChR, while K44A dynamin, which lacks only the first GTP-binding motif, blocks only M1mAChR internalization. It is possible that K44A dynamin selectively sequesters away an essential component of the M1 but not of the M2 mAChR internalization pathway. Another potential explanation relates to the fact that K44A dynamin is able to coassemble with wild-type dynamin (22.Warnock D.E. Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22310-22314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Since dynamin assembly and interaction of dynamin with other proteins requires the C terminus of the dynamin, which varies among the dynamin isoforms (23.Smirnova E. Shurland D.-L. Newman-Smith E.D. Pishvaee B. Van der Bliek A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14942-14947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), different internalization pathways may use different dynamin isoforms. As a result, different internalization pathways may display differential sensitivity toward interference of K44A dynamin. Perhaps assembled GTP-bound K44A dynamin is sufficiently active to catalyze the budding of M2 mAChR- and AT1AR-containing vesicles from the plasma membrane but is not able to support internalization of M1 mAChRs in clathrin-coated vesicles.In the present study, we observed that mAChR and AT1AR internalization in HEK-293 cells is strongly inhibited by expression of K535M dynamin, a dynamin mutant, which lacks the putative PIP2 binding site (6.Achiriloaie M. Barylko B. Albanesi J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1410-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). At present, it is unknown at which stage of the vesicle budding process PIP2 binding to dynamin is essential. It has been postulated that, after recruitment of dynamin to the clathrin-coated pit, dynamin's interaction with the plasma membrane is strengthened by the binding of dynamin's pleckstrin homology domain with PIP2 in the plasma membrane (8.Barylko B. Binns D. Lin K.-M. Atkinson M.A.L. Jameson D.M. Yin H.L. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3791-3797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In addition, PIP2 binding might promote self-assembly of the dynamin molecules at the neck of the clathrin-coated pit and stimulate dynamin's GTPase activity (8.Barylko B. Binns D. Lin K.-M. Atkinson M.A.L. Jameson D.M. Yin H.L. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3791-3797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 9.Klein D.E. Lee A. Frank D.W. Marks M.S. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27725-27733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). An alternative possibility is that lysine 535 in the pleckstrin homology domain of dynamin serves to promote interaction of dynamin with proteins rather than with PIP2 (6.Achiriloaie M. Barylko B. Albanesi J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1410-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Regardless of the mechanism, our study clearly underscores the relevance of dynamin's lysine 535 residue in GPCR internalization. Identification of the binding partners of dynamin's pleckstrin homology domain will be important for understanding the mechanisms of GPCR internalization.In analogy with recent studies on the regulation of internalization of β2-adrenergic receptors in HEK-293 cells (16.Ahn S. Maudsley S. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1185-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 24.Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.G. Daaka Y. Miller W.E. Maudsley S. Della Rocca G.J. Lin F.-T. Kawakatsu H. Owada K. Luttrell D.K. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar), we show that internalization of M1 mAChRs is strongly reduced by inhibition of c-Src activity and by overexpression of Y231F,Y597F dynamin, which cannot be phosphorylated by c-Src. Since M1 mAChRs internalize in clathrin-coated vesicles in a β-arrestin-dependent manner, we propose that, in analogy to β2-adrenergic receptors, internalization of M1 mAChRs involves β-arrestin-mediated targeting of receptor in the clathrin-coated pit and activation of c-Src by β-arrestin. c-Src then phosphorylates dynamin, a process that is required for M1 mAChR internalization in HEK-293 cells. Whether tyrosine phosphorylation activates dynamin or allows activation of dynamin by other molecules remains to be determined. In contrast, dynamin-mediated internalization of M2 mAChRs was found not to be inhibited by expression of kinase-defective K298M c-Src or treatment of the cells with the specific c-Src inhibitor PP1. Thus, c-Src does not play a role in M2 mAChR internalization. These findings are supported by recent studies showing that M2 mAChR internalization in HEK-293 cells is β-arrestin-independent (11.Vögler O. Nolte B. Voss M. Schmidt M. Jakobs K.H. Van Koppen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12333-12338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 12.Pals-Rylaarsdam R. Gurevich V.V. Lee K.B. Ptasiensky J.A. Benovic J.L. Hosey M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23682-23689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, treatment of the cells with the generic tyrosine kinase, genistein, or coexpression of Y231F,Y597F dynamin did slightly reduce M2 mAChR internalization. This suggests that M2 mAChR internalization is regulated to a very limited extent by phosphorylation of dynamin by tyrosine kinases other than c-Src. On the basis of the present and previous findings (11.Vögler O. Nolte B. Voss M. Schmidt M. Jakobs K.H. Van Koppen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12333-12338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we propose that M2 mAChR internalization in HEK-293 cells is catalyzed by a dynamin isoform that differs from the dynamin isoform involved in clathrin-mediated M1 mAChR internalization. Much remains to be learned about the internalization pathway of M2 mAChR (and AT1AR) in HEK-293 cells. We have observed that pretreatment of HEK-293 cells with 0.45m sucrose fully blocks M2 (and M1) mAChR internalization in HEK-293 cells. 2Y. Werbonat, N. Kleutges, K. H. Jakobs, and C. J. van Koppen, unpublished observations. Yet expression of a dominant-negative clathrin mutant or β-arrestin V53D, which inhibits clathrin-mediated internalization of GPCRs, blocks M1 but not M2 mAChR internalization (11.Vögler O. Nolte B. Voss M. Schmidt M. Jakobs K.H. Van Koppen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12333-12338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Similarly, expression of the amphiphysin SH3 domain, which blocks the targeting of dynamin to clathrin-coated pits, inhibits M1 but not M2mAChR internalization in HEK-293 cells.2 On the basis of these findings, we conclude that M2 mAChR internalization in HEK-293 cells is clathrin-independent and that the inhibitory effect of sucrose on receptor internalization is not specific for clathrin-mediated internalization. In this respect, it is important to note that hypertonic sucrose treatment of HEK-293 cells does not only block vesicle formation at the plasma membrane but may also induce other cellular responses including MAP kinase activation (25.Schramm N.L. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24935-24940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), which may inhibit receptor internalization indirectly (26.Pitcher J.A. Tesmer J.J.G. Freeman J.L.R. Capel W.D. Stone W.C. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34531-34534Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Interestingly, similar findings have been obtained recently with the secretin receptor. Internalization of secretin receptors in HEK-293 cells is unaffected by expression of dynamin K44A and β-arrestin V53D but is sensitive to sucrose pretreatment (15.Walker J.K.L. Premont R.T. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Shetzline M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31515-31523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Presently, it is unknown through which vesicles AT1AR internalizes in HEK-293 cells. In adrenal glomerulosa and Chinese hamster ovary cells, AT1AR may internalize through clathrin-coated vesicles, although this has only been inferred from biochemical (and not morphological) experiments using hypertonic sucrose treatment or potassium depletion (27.Hunyady L. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: S47-S56PubMed Google Scholar). In vascular smooth muscle cells, however, AT1ARs have been found to internalize through noncoated pits, possibly caveolae, as well as coated pits (27.Hunyady L. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: S47-S56PubMed Google Scholar, 28.Ishizaka N. Griendling K.K. Lassègue B. Alexander R.W. Hypertension. 1998; 32: 459-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). Thus, the internalization of AT1AR and other GPCRs (10.Vögler O. Bogatkewitsch G.S. Wriske C. Krummenerl P. Jakobs K.H. Van Koppen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12155-12160Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) appears to differ among different cell types. The identification of the budding vesicles through which AT1AR and M2 mAChR internalize in HEK-293 cells and other cell types will provide important information on the molecular mechanisms of GPCR internalization. For most G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs),1 receptor internalization is thought to be initiated by phosphorylation of the receptor by G protein-coupled receptor kinases and binding of the cytosolic protein β-arrestin to the phosphorylated receptor (1.Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). β-Arrestin then sterically inhibits further interaction of the receptor with heterotrimeric G proteins and binds with high affinity to clathrin heavy chains (1.Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1153) Google Scholar). Through this interaction, GPCRs are believed to be targeted to clathrin-coated pits. Following transformation of the clathrin-coated pit into a clathrin-coated vesicle, the clathrin-coated vesicle pinches off from the plasma membrane. This process is catalyzed by the 100-kDa GTPase dynamin, which probably activates (as yet largely unknown) effectors of the fission machinery (2.Sever S. Muhlberg A.B. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1999; 398: 481-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Three closely related mammalian dynamin isoforms have been identified: neuronal dynamin-1, ubiquitously expressed dynamin-2, and dynamin-3, which is expressed in testes, neurons, and lung (3.Schmid S.L. McNiven M.A. De Camilli P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 504-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). Comparison of the primary sequence shows that all three dynamin isoforms contain three highly conserved GTP-binding motifs (i.e. elements I, II, and III). A Lys44 → Ala substitution in the first of the three putative GTP-binding motifs yields a dominant-negative dynamin mutant, which displays strongly impaired GTPase activity and is predicted to have a greatly reduced GTP binding affinity (4.Van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). The two other GTP-binding motifs in dynamin are likely to be involved in GTP binding as well. Mutation of the third GTP-binding motif (substitution Lys206 → Asp in element III) or removal of all three GTP-binding motifs (amino acids 1–271 in dynamin-1) drastically reduces clathrin-coated vesicle-mediated internalization (4.Van der Bliek A.M.

Binding of PIP2 to dynamin not only strongly increases the GTPase activity of dynamin but may also serve to target dynamin to the plasma membrane, allowing subsequent dynamin self-assembly at the neck of the clathrin-coated vesicle (6.Achiriloaie M.

Cell Biol. 1999; 144: 31-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar), and secretin receptors (15.Walker J.K.L. Premont R.T. Barak L.S. Caron M.G. Shetzline M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31515-31523Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) is also insensitive to expression of K44A dynamin. This has led to the proposal that internalization of these GPCRs is dynamin-independent. However, in light of the notion that the binding of GTP to dynamin probably involves binding to all three GTP- binding motifs in the GTP-binding pocket, we reasoned that a dynamin mutant lacking all three GTP-binding motifs might be a more appropriate dominant negative dynamin mutant to determine whether internalization of a particular GPCR is dynamin-dependent. Indeed, we here demonstrate that internalization of M2 mAChR and AT1AR is strongly inhibited by expression of N272 dynamin, which lacks the complete GTP-binding domain. Also, expression of K535M dynamin, which lacks PIP2-stimulated GTPase activity, significantly blocks internalization of these GPCR species. DISCUSSIONIn the past few years, the question whether dynamin plays an essential role in the internalization of a particular GPCR has been mostly analyzed by using K44A dynamin as dominant-negative mutant. While internalization of most GPCRs is blocked by expression of K44A dynamin, some GPCRs like the M2 mAChRs, D2dopamine receptors, secretin receptors, and AT1ARs internalize irrespective of K44A dynamin expression, suggesting that internalization of these GPCRs is dynamin-independent (10.Vögler O.

We now report that, contrary to what is currently postulated, internalization of M2 mAChR and AT1AR is dynamin-dependent. Coexpression of the dominant-negative dynamin mutants N272 and K535M strongly inhibited M2 mAChR and AT1AR internalization in HEK-293 tsA201 cells. These findings imply that N272 and K535M dynamin are more appropriate dominant-negative dynamin mutants than K44A dynamin. In this context, it will be interesting to determine whether fluid-phase endocytosis (5.Herskovits J.S. Burgess C.C. Obar R.A. Vallee R.B. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 565-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar,20.Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1034) Google Scholar) and internalization of ricin (21.Simpson J.C. Smith D.C. Roberts L.M. Lord J.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1998; 239: 293-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) are affected by expression of N272 or K535M dynamin also, because these trafficking processes are not blocked by K44A dynamin and are thus considered to be dynamin-independent. It is intriguing that N272 dynamin, which lacks all three GTP-binding motifs, inhibits internalization of both M1 and M2 mAChR, while K44A dynamin, which lacks only the first GTP-binding motif, blocks only M1mAChR internalization. It is possible that K44A dynamin selectively sequesters away an essential component of the M1 but not of the M2 mAChR internalization pathway. Another potential explanation relates to the fact that K44A dynamin is able to coassemble with wild-type dynamin (22.Warnock D.E. Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22310-22314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Since dynamin assembly and interaction of dynamin with other proteins requires the C terminus of the dynamin, which varies among the dynamin isoforms (23.Smirnova E. Shurland D.-L. Newman-Smith E.D. Pishvaee B. Van der Bliek A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 14942-14947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), different internalization pathways may use different dynamin isoforms. As a result, different internalization pathways may display differential sensitivity toward interference of K44A dynamin. Perhaps assembled GTP-bound K44A dynamin is sufficiently active to catalyze the budding of M2 mAChR- and AT1AR-containing vesicles from the plasma membrane but is not able to support internalization of M1 mAChRs in clathrin-coated vesicles.In the present study, we observed that mAChR and AT1AR internalization in HEK-293 cells is strongly inhibited by expression of K535M dynamin, a dynamin mutant, which lacks the putative PIP2 binding site (6.Achiriloaie M. Barylko B. Albanesi J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1410-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). At present, it is unknown at which stage of the vesicle budding process PIP2 binding to dynamin is essential. It has been postulated that, after recruitment of dynamin to the clathrin-coated pit, dynamin's interaction with the plasma membrane is strengthened by the binding of dynamin's pleckstrin homology domain with PIP2 in the plasma membrane (8.Barylko B.

In addition, PIP2 binding might promote self-assembly of the dynamin molecules at the neck of the clathrin-coated pit and stimulate dynamin's GTPase activity (8.Barylko B. Binns D. Lin K.-M. Atkinson M.A.L. Jameson D.M. Yin H.L. Albanesi J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3791-3797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar, 9.Klein D.E. Lee A. Frank D.W. Marks M.S. Lemmon M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27725-27733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). An alternative possibility is that lysine 535 in the pleckstrin homology domain of dynamin serves to promote interaction of dynamin with proteins rather than with PIP2 (6.Achiriloaie M. Barylko B. Albanesi J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1410-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Regardless of the mechanism, our study clearly underscores the relevance of dynamin's lysine 535 residue in GPCR internalization. Identification of the binding partners of dynamin's pleckstrin homology domain will be important for understanding the mechanisms of GPCR internalization.In analogy with recent studies on the regulation of internalization of β2-adrenergic receptors in HEK-293 cells (16.Ahn S. Maudsley S. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Daaka Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1185-1188Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 24.Luttrell L.M. Ferguson S.S.G. Daaka Y.

Science. 1999; 283: 655-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (1250) Google Scholar), we show that internalization of M1 mAChRs is strongly reduced by inhibition of c-Src activity and by overexpression of Y231F,Y597F dynamin, which cannot be phosphorylated by c-Src. Since M1 mAChRs internalize in clathrin-coated vesicles in a β-arrestin-dependent manner, we propose that, in analogy to β2-adrenergic receptors, internalization of M1 mAChRs involves β-arrestin-mediated targeting of receptor in the clathrin-coated pit and activation of c-Src by β-arrestin. c-Src then phosphorylates dynamin, a process that is required for M1 mAChR internalization in HEK-293 cells. Whether tyrosine phosphorylation activates dynamin or allows activation of dynamin by other molecules remains to be determined. In contrast, dynamin-mediated internalization of M2 mAChRs was found not to be inhibited by expression of kinase-defective K298M c-Src or treatment of the cells with the specific c-Src inhibitor PP1. Thus, c-Src does not play a role in M2 mAChR internalization. These findings are supported by recent studies showing that M2 mAChR internalization in HEK-293 cells is β-arrestin-independent (11.Vögler O. Nolte B. Voss M. Schmidt M. Jakobs K.H. Van Koppen C.J.

However, treatment of the cells with the generic tyrosine kinase, genistein, or coexpression of Y231F,Y597F dynamin did slightly reduce M2 mAChR internalization. This suggests that M2 mAChR internalization is regulated to a very limited extent by phosphorylation of dynamin by tyrosine kinases other than c-Src. On the basis of the present and previous findings (11.Vögler O. Nolte B. Voss M. Schmidt M. Jakobs K.H. Van Koppen C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12333-12338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), we propose that M2 mAChR internalization in HEK-293 cells is catalyzed by a dynamin isoform that differs from the dynamin isoform involved in clathrin-mediated M1 mAChR internalization. Much remains to be learned about the internalization pathway of M2 mAChR (and AT1AR) in HEK-293 cells. We have observed that pretreatment of HEK-293 cells with 0.45m sucrose fully blocks M2 (and M1) mAChR internalization in HEK-293 cells. 2Y. Werbonat, N. Kleutges, K. H. Jakobs, and C. J. van Koppen, unpublished observations. Yet expression of a dominant-negative clathrin mutant or β-arrestin V53D, which inhibits clathrin-mediated internalization of GPCRs, blocks M1 but not M2 mAChR internalization (11.Vögler O. Nolte B.

Similarly, expression of the amphiphysin SH3 domain, which blocks the targeting of dynamin to clathrin-coated pits, inhibits M1 but not M2mAChR internalization in HEK-293 cells.2 On the basis of these findings, we conclude that M2 mAChR internalization in HEK-293 cells is clathrin-independent and that the inhibitory effect of sucrose on receptor internalization is not specific for clathrin-mediated internalization. In this respect, it is important to note that hypertonic sucrose treatment of HEK-293 cells does not only block vesicle formation at the plasma membrane but may also induce other cellular responses including MAP kinase activation (25.Schramm N.L. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24935-24940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), which may inhibit receptor internalization indirectly (26.Pitcher J.A.

Interestingly, similar findings have been obtained recently with the secretin receptor. Internalization of secretin receptors in HEK-293 cells is unaffected by expression of dynamin K44A and β-arrestin V53D but is sensitive to sucrose pretreatment (15.Walker J.K.L. Premont R.T.

Presently, it is unknown through which vesicles AT1AR internalizes in HEK-293 cells. In adrenal glomerulosa and Chinese hamster ovary cells, AT1AR may internalize through clathrin-coated vesicles, although this has only been inferred from biochemical (and not morphological) experiments using hypertonic sucrose treatment or potassium depletion (27.Hunyady L. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: S47-S56PubMed Google Scholar). In vascular smooth muscle cells, however, AT1ARs have been found to internalize through noncoated pits, possibly caveolae, as well as coated pits (27.Hunyady L. J. Am. Soc.

Thus, the internalization of AT1AR and other GPCRs (10.Vögler O. Bogatkewitsch G.S. Wriske C. Krummenerl P. Jakobs K.H. Van Koppen C.J. J. Biol.

https://openalex.org/W2076955269,"In response to the starvation of a single amino acid, the budding yeast <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> activates numerous genes involved in various amino acid biosynthetic pathways, all of which are under the control of transcription factor GCN4. This general amino acid control response is based on de-repressed translation of <i>GCN4</i> mRNA, which is induced by the activation of the eIF2α kinase, GCN2. Although it is known that<i>in vivo</i> activation of GCN2 requires GCN1, the mode of GCN1 action remains to be elucidated at the molecular level. Here, we show that GCN2 interacts with GCN1 via the GI domain, a novel protein-binding module that occurs at the N terminus; mutations to conserved residues of this domain abolish its binding to GCN1. Furthermore, the yeast cells with GCN2 defective in interaction with GCN1 fail to display general control response. A similar phenotype is observed in cells overexpressing the GI domain of GCN2 or its target region on GCN1. Thus, GI domain-mediated association of GCN2 to GCN1 is required for general amino acid control. This finding provides the first insight into the molecular mechanism for the activation of GCN2 by GCN1."

Factor XIII stabilizes this clot by catalyzing the formation of intermolecular cross-links in the fibrin network. Thrombin activates the Factor XIII a2 dimer by cleaving the Factor XIII activation peptide segment at the Arg37-Gly38 peptide bond. Using a high performance liquid chromatography assay, the kinetic constants K m, k cat, andk cat/K m were determined for thrombin hydrolysis of fibrinogen Aα-(7–20), Factor XIII activation peptide-(28–41), and Factor XIII activation peptide-(28–41) with a Val34 to Leu substitution. This Val to Leu mutation has been correlated with protection from myocardial infarction. In the absence of fibrin, the Factor XIII activation peptide-(28–41) exhibits a 10-fold lower k cat/K mvalue than fibrinogen Aα-(7–20). With the Factor XIII V34L mutation, decreases in K m and increases ink cat produce a 6-fold increase ink cat/K m relative to the wild-type Factor XIII sequence. A review of the x-ray crystal structures of known substrates and inhibitors of thrombin leads to a hypothesis that the new Leu generates a peptide with more extensive interactions with the surface of thrombin.

In blood coagulation, the serine protease thrombin cleaves the N-terminal portions of the Aα and Bβ chains. For the Aα chain, cleavage occurs at the Arg16-Gly17 peptide bond and fibrinopeptide A (FpA)1 is released; whereas, for the Bβ chain, cleavage occurs at the Arg14-Gly15 peptide bond and fibrinopeptide B (FpB) is released. Removal of the fibrinopeptides leads to exposure of fibrin polymerization sites that react to form an insoluble blood clot (reviewed in Ref. 1.Halkier T. Mechanisms in Blood Coagulation Fibrinolysis and the Complement System. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1991: 3-103Google Scholar). Activated Factor XIII helps stabilize this clot structure by catalyzing the formation of intermolecular γ-glutamyl-ε-lysine cross-links in the fibrin network and in fibrin-enzyme complexes. Factor XIII is a member of a family of enzymes known as transglutaminases that have a catalytic triad, similar to cysteine proteases, composed of amino acids Cys314, His373, and Asp396. In plasma, Factor XIII is expressed as a zymogen of the form a2b2. In the presence of thrombin and calcium, the a2 unit is released and activated. By contrast, platelet Factor XIII is expressed as the zymogen a2 unit (reviewed in Ref. 2.Muszbek L. Yee V.C. Hevessy Z. Thromb. Res. 1999; 94: 271-305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). The Factor XIII a2 dimer contains in the N-terminal portion of each monomer a sequence known as the activation peptide (3.Yee V.C. Le Trong I. Bishop P.D. Pedersen L.C. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C.

Each activation peptide segment crosses the dimer interface and extends over the catalytic site of the opposing Factor XIII a subunit. Cleavage of the activation peptide segments by thrombin at the Arg37-Gly38 peptide bond aids in exposure of the Factor XIII active site residues. X-ray crystallography on thrombin-cleaved Factor XIII indicates that the activation peptides do not immediately dissociate following cleavage (4.Yee V.C. Pedersen L.C. Bishop P.D. Stenkamp R.E.

A segment of fibrin-I is known to bind at thrombin anion-exosite I, whereas other separate segments of fibrin-I are hypothesized to bind to Factor XIII. Within the Factor XIII activation peptide segment, there is a stretch of amino acids that contains features reminiscent of several diverse agents that interact with thrombin. TableI shows sequences for Fibrinogen Aα (amino acids 7–20) (Fbg Aα-(7–20)), Factor XIII activation peptide (aa 28–41) (FXIII AP-(28–41)),d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethylketone (PPACK), and thrombin receptor (aa 32–45) (PAR1-(32–45)). In each peptide, there is an Arg residue at the P1position 2The P nomenclature system ( … P3, P2, P1, P1′, P2′, P3′ … ) is used to assign the individual amino acid positions on the substrate peptides (8.Schechter I.

Insertion residues are defined using an alphabetical nomenclature (for example, Trp60D corresponds to the fourth residue inserted at position 60). Asp189. FXIII AP-(28–41), PAR1-(32–45), and PPACK each contain a proline at the P2 position. X-ray crystal studies of PAR1-(32–45) and PPACK reveal that thrombin contains a hydrophobic surface that can accommodate this proline (9.Bode W. Mayr I. Baumann U. Huber R. Stone S.R. Hofsteenge J.

In contrast, a tendency to form rigid fibrin networks has been reported in men who have experienced an episode of myocardial infarction at an early age (19.Fatah K. Silviera A. Tornvall P. Karpe F. Blomback M. Hamsten A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 535-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). In addition to its possible role in minimizing myocardial infarction, the Factor XIII V34L mutation has also been correlated with protection against venous thromboembolism (20.Franco R.F. Reitsma P.H. Lourenço D. Maffei F.H. Morelli V. Tavella M.H. Araújo A.G. Piccinato C.E. Zago M.A. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1999; 81: 676-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar, 21.Catto A.J.

Kohler H.P. Bannan S. Stickland M. Carter A. Grant P.J. Stroke. 1998; 29: 813-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Factor XIII V34L is a common polymorphism estimated to occur in 20–25% of the Caucasian population (23.Kohler H.P. Grant P.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 862Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 24.McCormack L.J. Kain K. Catto A.J. Kohler H.P. Stickland M.H. Grant P.J. Thromb.

The characteristics and prevalence of Factor XIII V34L have been examined in different ethnic groups including Finnish, Russian, German, Japanese, and Native American Pima (23.Kohler H.P. Grant P.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 862Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 24.McCormack L.J. Kain K. Catto A.J. Kohler H.P. Stickland M.H. Grant P.J. Thromb.

A G to T point mutation in codon 34, exon 2 of the Factor XIII a subunit gene, is responsible for the Val (GTG) to Leu (TTG) change. The beneficial effects of the V34L mutation are negated by the presence of additional hemostatic risk factors such as increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, decreased plasmin, and increased tissue plasminogen activator (17.Kohler H.P. Stickland M.H. Ossei-Gerning N. Carter A. Mikkola H. Grant P.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 79: 8-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). These agents compete for ability to maintain or lyse the fibrin clots. Possible explanations for how V34L protects against myocardial infarction include the following: 1) the mutation hinders activation of Factor XIII a2 thus slowing down initiation of fibrin cross-linking, or 2) the mutation accelerates activation of the Factor XIII a2 before sufficient fibrin is produced and as a result leads to early depletion of usable levels of Factor XIII. To aid in elucidating the source of the cardioprotective effects of Factor XIII V34L, a kinetic study was initiated. An HPLC assay was used to compare the ability of thrombin to hydrolyze a segment of the Fibrinogen Aα chain (Fbg Aα-(7–20)), the native Factor XIII Activation Peptide (FXIII AP-(28–41)), and the mutant peptide (FXIII AP-(28–41), V34L). The kinetic values K m,k cat, andk cat/K m were determined for each peptide. The Fbg Aα amino acids 7–20 bind along the active site surface of the enzyme thrombin and serve as a good model for the complete Fibrinogen Aα chain, a major substrate of this serine protease. Kinetic results indicate that, in the absence of fibrin, hydrolysis of the native FXIII AP-(28–41) has a lowerk cat/K m value than hydrolysis of Fbg Aα-(7–20). The Factor XIII V34L mutation yields a peptide with improved kinetic properties that begin to approach those of Fbg Aα-(7–20). Activation of Factor XIII V34L by thrombin is proposed to be accelerated over that of wild-type Factor XIII. A review of kinetic properties and the x-ray crystal structures of known substrates and inhibitors of thrombin leads to the hypothesis that the Val to Leu substitution generates a peptide exhibiting more extensive interactions with the surface of thrombin. As a result of these characteristics, the mutant Factor XIII may lead to premature depletion of transglutaminase activity and thus to decreased levels of cross-linked products. Bovine plasma barium citrate eluate, bovine Fibrinogen, and Echis carinatus snake venom were purchased from Sigma. HPLC grade acetonitrile, trifluoroacetic acid, Trizma (Tris base), NaCl, PEG 8000, and phosphoric acid were purchased from Fisher and Sigma. Peptides based upon residues 7–20 of the human Fibrinogen Aα chain were synthesized by solid-phase methodologies by the Cornell University Biotechnology Resource Center (Ithaca, NY). Peptides based on residues 28–41 of the human Factor XIII activation peptide sequence were synthesized by the Cornell University Biotechnology Resource Center and Genemed Synthesis (South San Francisco, CA). The amino acid sequences of the peptides are as follows: Fbg Aα-(7–20) (Ac-DFLAEGGGVRGPRV-amide), FXIII AP-(28–41) (Ac-TVELQGVVPRGVNL-amide), and FXIII AP-(28–41) V34L (Ac-TVELQGLVPRGVNL-amide). The purity of the peptides was verified by analytical reversed phase-HPLC and/or by capillary electrophoresis. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight measurements on a Voyager DE-Pro mass spectrometer (PE Biosystems) revealed the molecular ion m/z values of Fbg Aα-(7–20), FXIII AP-(28–41), FXIII AP-(28–41) V34L to be 1470.8, 1521.88, and 1535.95, respectively. The calculated theoretical values are 1471.6, 1521.5, and 1536.9, respectively. Bovine thrombin was isolated and purified by methods similar to those of Ni et al. (12.Ni F. Meinwald Y.C. Vásquez M. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 3094-3105Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and Maurer et al. (26.Maurer M.C. Peng J-L. An S.S. Trosset J-Y. Henschen-Edman A. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5888-5902Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, bovine plasma barium citrate eluate containing prothrombin was activated with E. carinatus snake venom. The resultant thrombin-containing mixture was desalted on Amersham Pharmacia Biotech PD-10 columns and then purified on a Amersham Pharmacia Biotech Mono S cation exchange column (HR 5/5) using a Waters HPLC system (model 600 controller and pump system, Rheodyne manual injector, and a 2487 dual λ absorbance detector). The pooled thrombin solution was subjected to ultrafiltration. The final concentration of protein was determined by using an extinction coefficient, E 1% = 19.5 at 280 nm (27.Winzor D.J. Scheraga H.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1964; 104: 202-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For this project, bovine thrombin was used as the enzyme and the synthetic substrate peptides were based on human sequences. These complexes were prepared so that a direct comparison could be made with previously published HPLC kinetic results (28.Marsh Jr., H.C. Meinwald Y.C. Thannhauser T.W. Scheraga H.A.

Thrombin exhibits a high conservation of sequence between human and bovine forms (31.Bode W. Dusan T. Karshikov A. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 426-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). There are no differences in the residues involving the active site, the thrombin β-insertion loop (also called the Trp60D loop), or the allosteric Na+-binding site. The minor differences that do exist between species are not anticipated to interfere with interactions of the substrate peptides at the thrombin active site surface (32.Dang Q.D. Sabetta M. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19649-19651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Experimental kinetic methods similar to those of Maurer et al. (26.Maurer M.C. Peng J-L. An S.S. Trosset J-Y. Henschen-Edman A. Scheraga H.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5888-5902Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) were employed. Unique features of the experimental design are summarized. A solution of peptide and assay buffer (50 mm H3PO4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% PEG, pH 7.4) was warmed to 25 °C in a heat block. Hydrolysis of the individual peptides was then initiated by addition of thrombin into a total assay volume of 250 μl. The final thrombin concentrations were 34, 2.2, and 2.2 nm for hydrolysis of FXIII AP-(28–41), FXIII AP-(28–41) V34L, and Fbg Aα-(7–20), respectively. At designated time intervals, 38 μl of reaction mixture were removed and quenched with 7 μl of 12.5% H3PO4. Time points were chosen such that <15% of the total peptide concentration was hydrolyzed. The reaction products were analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC, using a Brownlee Aquapore Octyl RP-300 C8 cartridge column on a Waters HPLC system containing an autosampler (model 600 controller and pump system, 717plus autosampler, and 2487 dual λ absorbance detector). Absorbance was measured at 205 nm. A linear gradient of 15% CH3CN, 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid in water to 50% CH3CN, 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid in water in 20 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min was employed for FXIII AP-(28–41) and Fbg Aα-(7–20). A linear gradient of 15% CH3CN, 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid in water to 50% CH3CN, 0.09% trifluoroacetic acid in water in 45 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min was employed for FXIII AP-(28–41) V34L. Peaks appearing between 3 and 12 min were integrated using Waters Millenium software. Peak areas corresponding to the hydrolyzed products were converted into concentrations by applying a linear calibration curve. These calibration curves were generated from HPLC runs of the products Fbg Aα-(7–16), FXIII AP-(28–37), and FXIII AP-(28–37) V34L. Stock concentrations of these peptides were determined by quantitative amino acid analysis by the Cornell Biotechnology Resource Center. Standard peptide calibration curves over the range of 8 to 120 μmwere generated. The same HPLC gradients used for the kinetic assays were employed here. Initial velocities (in micromolar/s) for the thrombin-catalyzed reactions were determined for each peptide concentration from the slopes of product concentration versus time plots. The resultant kinetic data were fit to the equation, V =V max/{1 + K m/[S]}, by nonlinear regression methods using the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm in Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific). K m,V max, and k cat were calculated from the coefficients of this equation. The peptide concentrations examined include 143.4 to 491.5 μm for Fbg Aα-(7–20), 105 to 597 μm for FXIII AP-(28–41), and 143.4 to 491.5 μm for FXIII AP-(28–41) V34L. An HPLC assay was employed to monitor the rates of hydrolysis of a series of Fibrinogen Aα-like and Factor XIII-like peptides by thrombin. Thrombin cleaved Fbg Aα-(7–20) at the Arg16-Gly17 peptide bond and cleaved the Factor XIII activation peptides (FXIII AP and FXIII AP V34L) at the Arg37-Gly38 peptide bond. The hydrolyzed products Fbg Aα-(7–16), FXIII AP-(28–37), and FXIII AP-(28–37) V34L all eluted from the Brownlee Aquapore C8 column as distinct peaks at about 4.5 min whereas the parent substrate peptides eluted around 9.3 min. The identities of the product peaks were verified by amino acid analysis and by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Fig. 1 shows a typical chromatogram for hydrolysis of 400 μm FXIII AP-(28–41) by thrombin. Nonlinear regression analysis values for K m, k cat, andk cat/K m are shown in TableII. For thrombin hydrolysis of Fbg Aα-(7–20) the K m value was 312 ± 42 μm, the k cat value was 39.3 ± 2.6 s−1, and thek cat/K m value was 0.126 ± 0.019 μm−1 s−1. These values are consistent with those reported earlier by Marsh et al.(29.Marsh Jr., H.C. Meinwald Y.C. Lee S. Scheraga H.A.

Open table in a new tab Kinetic constants for thrombin-catalyzed hydrolysis of peptides based on the fibrinogen Aα chain and the Factor XIII activation peptide segment were determined from an HPLC assay as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The results shown here represent averages for at least three independent experiments. Kinetic values reported were calculated using nonlinear regression analysis methods. Kinetic parameters were then determined for thrombin hydrolysis of FXIII AP-(28–41) and FXIII AP-(28–41) V34L (Table II). For the FXIII AP-(28–41), the K m value increased 1.6-fold to 508 ± 44 μm relative to that of the Fbg Aα-(7–20) and the k cat value decreased 6-fold to 6.4 ± 0.03 s−1. The resultantk cat/K m value decreased 10-fold from that of Fbg Aα-(7–20) to give a value of 0.013 ± 0.001. It should be noted that to maintain the same extent of hydrolysis within a given time point range more thrombin was needed to carry out the measurements for the Factor XIII activation peptide segment than for the Fibrinogen Aα-like segment. The experimentally determined kinetic parameters indicate there is a substantial difference in the specificity of thrombin for Fbg Aα-(7–20)versus FXIII AP-(28–41). For thrombin hydrolysis of the mutant segment FXIII AP-(28–41) V34L, nonlinear regression analysis of the data revealed aK m of 272 ± 57 μm, ak cat of 18.5 ± 1.6 s−1, and a kcat/K m of 0.068 ± 0.015 μm−1 s−1 (Table II). The substitution of leucine for valine at position 34 has led to the creation of a substrate with improved kinetic properties over those of the wild-type FXIII AP segment. The properties begin to approach those of Fbg Aα-(7–20). Taking the error limits into account, theK m values for FXIII AP-(28–41) V34Lversus Fbg Aα-(7–20) are quite similar (272 ± 57versus 312 ± 42 μm). In the presence of the V34L mutation, the k cat value increased for Factor XIII activation peptide cleavage from 6.4 ± 0.03 to 18.5 ± 1.6 s−1 and is now approximately half that of Fbg Aα-(7–20) (39.3 ± 2.6 s−1). Furthermore, the amount of thrombin used to generate the kinetic results for the V34L work was the same as those used for Fbg Aα-(7–20). A review of thek cat/K m values suggests that thrombin exhibits a greater specificity for the V34L mutant sequence than the wild-type sequence. The results reported here, for bovine thrombin in the presence of human Factor XIII AP segments, are consistent with the findings of Kohler et al. (15.Kohler H.P. Grant P.J. Quart. J. Med. 1999; 92: 67-72Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) on Factor XIII V34L isolated from patients. Preliminary data from their laboratories indicate that lower thrombin levels are required to activate Factor XIII V34L than to activate wild-type Factor XIII. The kinetics associated with thrombin hydrolysis of a Fibrinogen Aα-like peptide and two Factor XIII activation peptide segments have been examined. A Val to Leu substitution at position 34 of the Factor XIII activation peptide segment generates a substrate with improved kinetic properties relative to that of the wild-type sequence. A review of the sequence, kinetic, and structural properties of thrombin substrates/inhibitors leads to a proposal for how Factor XIII V34L might promote beneficial cardiovascular effects. The peptide substrates analyzed here contain amino acids that only interact with thrombin along a surface surrounding the active site of the enzyme. Work with peptides of this length allows for examination of the influence of individual substrate amino acids on the catalytic properties of thrombin. The human Factor XIII activation peptide segment contains 34VVPR37 at the P4-P1 substrate positions. The strongest benefits for thrombin binding are likely derived from the Pro and Arg residues (33.Lottenberg R. Hall J.A. Blinder M. Binder E.P. Jackson C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1983; 742: 539-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 34.Le Bonniec B.F. Myles T. Johnson T. Knight C.G. Tapparelli C. Stone S.R.

Thrombosis Res. 1993; 69: 1-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) on PPACK (d-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethylketone) bound to thrombin have shown that the Pro at P2 is positioned to interact with a hydrophobic cage formed by the thrombin side chains of Trp215, Leu99, His57, Tyr60A, and Trp60D. This region is also known as the apolar-binding site. Thrombin exhibits greater substrate specificity for the Factor XIII activation peptide segment when the 34VVPR37sequence is converted to 34LVPR37. The presence of the larger hydrocarbon side chain on leucine may promote further interactions with the thrombin surface, allowing for more contact within the apolar-binding site on thrombin. The new leucine may promote the decreases in K m relative to the wild-type sequence and, as a result of better interactions with the thrombin surface, the increase in k cat. Together these changes have allowed thek cat/K m value to increase 6-fold relative to the wild-type sequence. The Factor XIII V34L mutant sequence 34LVPR37is similar to the 38LDPR41 of the PAR1 thrombin receptor. However, hydrolysis of a thrombin receptor PAR1 peptide (29PESKATNATLDPRSFLL45) exhibits a higherK m value than both Factor XIII activation peptides (see Table II) (38.Ishii K. Gerszten R. Zheng Y.W.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3266-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) studies suggest the LDPR segment binds along the apolar-binding site but the Asp39 causes electrostatic interference that hinders optimal binding along this thrombin surface (10.Mathews I.I. Padmanabhan K.P. Ganesh V. Tulinsky A. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3266-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 37.Stubbs M.T. Bode W. Thrombosis Res. 1993; 69: 1-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). The Factor XIII AP segment does not contain an interfering acidic residue, and as a result, FXIII-like peptides targeted to the active site of thrombin serve as better substrates than similar PAR1-like peptides. In contrast to the FXIII- and PAR1-based peptides, the Fbg Aα-(7–20) peptide does not generate beneficial interactions with the surface of thrombin through a proline. In the bound structure, a multiple-turn conformation involving Fbg Aα Phe8, Leu9, and Val15 provides key sites for interaction with the thrombin apolar-binding site. As a result of this interaction, the non-optimal nature of the Aα chain can be overcome and the sequence can be cleaved effectively. Thek cat/K m value for hydrolysis of the Factor XIII AP segment only begins to approach that of Fbg Aα-(7–20) in the presence of the V34L substitution. The kinetic results obtained with the Factor XIII activation peptides thus provide convincing evidence that a relatively conservative amino acid substitution to the P3 substrate position causes a significant improvement in substrate specificity. An increase in thek cat value for hydrolysis of the mutant Factor XIII sequence plays a major role in this change. The different kinetic parameters obtained for hydrolysis of the peptide models therefore help explain the reports that human Factor XIII V34L requires less thrombin for activation than the wild-type Factor XIII (15.Kohler H.P. Grant P.J. Quart. J. Med. 1999; 92: 67-72Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In nature, the proteins thrombin, fibrin, and plasma Factor XIII function in a triad, with fibrin serving as a cofactor for Factor XIII activation (5.Naski M.C. Lorand L. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 934-941Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 6.Hornyak T.J. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 423-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Recent results from Brummelet al. (7.Brummel K.E. Butenas S. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22862-22870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) on the extrinsic coagulation pathway of human whole blood suggest that Factor XIII activation and its subsequent cross-linking capabilities occur immediately in response to removal of fibrinopeptide A from fibrinogen. In the presence of the resultant fibrin-I, activation of plasma Factor XIII is accelerated with thek cat/K m for a ternary complex of thrombin, Factor XIII, and fibrin becoming comparable to thek cat/K m for thrombin-fibrinogen interactions. The use of a triad in the enzymatic blood coagulation mechanisms ensures that activated plasma Factor XIII is generated close to its substrates, the linear fibrin monomers, thereby minimizing wasteful generation of the Factor XIII when fibrin levels are low. This sort of strategy allows Factor XIII zymogen levels to remain conserved when substrate is not available (42.Lewis S.D. Janus T.J. Lorand L. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6772-6777Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 43.Greenberg C.S. Achyuthan K.E. Fenton J.W., II Blood. 1987; 69: 867-871Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Information from the blood coagulation/anticoagulation cascades may be used to propose why the Factor XIII V34L mutation may exert cardioprotective effects. Individuals bearing this mutation may be capable of producing higher levels of activated plasma Factor XIII than those bearing the wild-type Factor XIII. Furthermore, the Factor XIII V34L may have less of a dependence on fibrin-I to accelerate its activation by thrombin. Thus, the presence of the V34L mutation may lead to wasteful generation of activated Factor XIII. The excess activated Factor XIII a2 subunits may then be susceptible to further proteolysis by thrombin at the secondary Factor XIII cleavage site Lys513-Ser514. Proteolytic enzymes other than thrombin could also be involved in inactivation or degradation processes. As a consequence of the V34L mutation, the ability to promote extensive covalent cross-linking of fibrin and fibrin-enzyme complexes may become diminished prematurely (42.Lewis S.D. Janus T.J. Lorand L. Shafer J.A. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 6772-6777Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 43.Greenberg C.S. Achyuthan K.E.

This type of premature depletion of an activated enzyme has also been observed for the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin (46.Önundarson P.T. Haraldsson H.M. Bergmann L. Francis C.W. Marder V.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1993; 70: 998-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Plasmin is involved in promoting lysis of the blood clots. If tissue plasminogen activator is employed in the zymogen activation process, a fibrin surface is required, and plasmin is produced in the vicinity of its own substrate (47.Collen D. Lijnen H.R. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1995; 74: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). By contrast, if streptokinase is employed, the fibrin surface is no longer required (48.Reed G.L. Houng A.K. Lin L. Parhami-Seren B. Matsueda L.H. Wang S. Hedstrom L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8879-8883Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 49.Marder V.J. Sherry S. N. Engl. J. Med. 1988; 318: 1512-1520Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Plasmin can be generated at a site distant from fibrin, and the levels of plasmin may become prematurely depleted before this plasmin has an opportunity to reach its target. In addition to playing a role in Factor XIII activation, the V34L mutation has also been reported to affect the cross-linking activity of this transglutaminase. Work with native and recombinant Factor XIII indicates that the V34L enzyme exhibits a higher specific activity than wild-type enzyme (50.Kangsadalampai S. Board P.G. Blood. 1998; 92: 2766-2770Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 51.Anwar R. Gallivan L. Edmonds S.D. Markham A.F. Blood. 1999; 93: 897-905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This result suggests that the activation peptide may actually participate in promoting the transglutaminase reaction of Factor XIII. Somehow this participation is further amplified and/or changed in the presence of the mutant sequence. The activation peptide does not leave immediately following cleavage and is proposed to remain bound until after introduction of Factor XIII substrates (3.Yee V.C. Le Trong I. Bishop P.D. Pedersen L.C. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1996; 22: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 4.Yee V.C. Pedersen L.C. Bishop P.D. Stenkamp R.E. Teller D.C. Thromb. Res. 1995; 78: 389-397Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In the presence of the V34L mutation, the number and/or type of substrates that can be accommodated by the Factor XIII active site surface and subjected to cross-linking may become altered. Further work on binding of substrates to the intact enzyme is necessary to elucidate the source of the increase in specific activity for the mutant and to correlate this increase with the observed physiological responses. The increase in Factor XIII specific activity may contribute a yet unidentified role in protection against myocardial infarction. Alternatively, the mutation may generate an increased catalytic effect that becomes diminished before its benefits can be realized. Our kinetic studies reveal that thrombin-catalyzed hydrolysis of a Factor XIII-based activation peptide containing the V34L mutation leads to decreases inK m, increases in k cat, and as a result, increases ink cat/K m relative to the wild-type sequence. The Factor XIII sequence VVPR is converted to LVPR. The Leu substitution is proposed to make more contacts with the apolar-binding site region on thrombin eventually leading to increases in substrate specificity relative to the wild-type sequence. As a result of these changes, Factor XIII V34L is hypothesized to be susceptible to wasteful conversion of zymogen to activated enzyme. Premature depletion may provide protective effects against cardiovascular disease."

To assess the role of this protein in tumorigenesis, we investigated whether induced overexpression of bamacan/SMC3 could transform normal fibroblasts. We generated a full-length cDNA encoding the entire mouse bamacan/SMC3 and demonstrated appropriate transcription and translation into a 146-kDa protein. All the NIH and Balb/c 3T3 murine fibroblasts overexpressing this bamacan/SMC3 transgene generated foci of transformation and acquired anchorage-independent growth. The increased levels of bamacan/SMC3 expression achieved in the transfected fibroblasts were the same as those detected in a series of spontaneously transformed murine and human colon carcinoma cells. Moreover, a 3-4-fold overexpression of bamacan/SMC3 was detected in ∼70% of human colon carcinoma specimens from matched pairs (n = 19, p < 0.0002) and in a cohort of intestinal tumors fromApc-deficient Min/+ mice.

Secondary structure analysis of the protein reveals three globular domains intercalated by two α-helix coiled-coils in an antiparallel arrangement folded at a flexible hinge (10.Melby T.E. Ciampaglio C.N. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The terminal ends harbor five glycanation sites to which the attachment of glycosaminoglycan side GAG chains is possible, and a P-loop and a DA-box motif that may act cooperatively to bind ATP and DNA, respectively (11.Strunnikov A. Jessberger R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These features and the high sequence homology with the structural maintenance of chromosome 3 (SMC3)1 protein led us to conclude that bamacan is a member of this family (6.Ghiselli G. Siracusa L. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17384-17393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). SMC3 proteins are involved in the formation of at least two multimeric complexes within the nucleus. The first, termed “cohesin”, is involved in chromosome cohesion and prevents premature sister chromatid separation (12.Michaelis C. Ciosk R. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1999; 91: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). The second, called RC-1, is involved in DNA repair and has DNA ligase and polymerase activity (13.Jessberger R. Podust V. Hübscher U. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15070-15079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of a third complex has been postulated on the basis that bamacan/SMC3 can be co-isolated with proteins involved in microtubule dynamics (9.Shimizu K. Shirataki H. Honda T. Minami S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6591-6594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Finally, the protein has a functional leucine zipper domain that binds Mxi and Max, two nuclear proteins that interact with Myc and modulate its transcriptional activity (14.Gupta K. Anand G. Yin X. Grove L. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1149-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar).We previously detected increased bamacan/SMC3 mRNA levels in several transformed cell lines (6.Ghiselli G. Siracusa L. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17384-17393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), suggesting that the amplified product of the normal gene may play a role in tumorigenesis. To directly test this hypothesis we investigated the effects of transgenic overexpression of bamacan/SMC3 in NIH and Balb/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. All the cells overexpressing bamacan/SMC3 showed evidence of transformation, including anchorage-independent growth and foci of transformation. Moreover, all the stably transfected clones exhibited increased levels of bamacan/SMC3 identical to those of spontaneously transformed human colon carcinoma cell lines and colon cancer specimens, as well as intestinal tumors from Apc-deficientMin/+ mice. Thus, deregulated expression of bamacan/SMC3 may be directly linked to the complex process of oncogenesis.DISCUSSIONThe results of this study strengthen the notion that bamacan/SMC3 may play an important role in tumorigenesis (6.Ghiselli G. Siracusa L. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17384-17393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The degree of gene activation that leads to cell transformation in normal mouse cells is comparable with that observed in a series of colon carcinomas cell lines and in the majority of human colon carcinoma specimens. The average 4-fold increase supports the idea that bamacan/SMC3 biosynthesis is tightly regulated in normal cells and that an imbalance in the amounts of this protein can directly affect the transformation program.Several functional roles have been assigned to eukaryotic bamacan/SMC3 for which it is possible to envision mechanisms linking its overexpression to cell growth disregulation. The involvement of this protein in chromatid cohesion during metaphase points to a first mechanism (18.Darwiche N. Freeman L.A. Strunnikov A. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 233: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The protein is part of the cohesin multimeric protein complex that prevents the premature separation of sister chromatids (12.Michaelis C. Ciosk R. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1999; 91: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). This process occurs in an orderly fashion during anaphase under the control of the cell cycle machinery and, if improperly executed, could result in the segregation of both sisters to the same cell thereby generating an aneuploid karyotype (19.Farr K.A. Cohen-Fix O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Bamacan/SMC3 is also a necessary component, together with SMC1, of a multimeric complex named RC1 that has DNA recombination/renaturation, DNA ligase, and DNA polymerase activities (13.Jessberger R. Podust V. Hübscher U. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15070-15079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymes act in concert to repair a gapped or deleted DNA. These different functions of bamacan/SMC3 are mediated by its ability to bind palindromic DNA sequences through its C terminus and by allowing the formation of protein-DNA structures that are accessible to the action of DNA-modifying enzymes (20.Akhmedov A.T. Gross B. Jessberger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38216-38224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 21.Moghal N. Sternberg P.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar).The functional significance of proteoglycan core protein in the nucleus and at the same time extracellularly eludes a simple interpretation. Proteoglycans can affect cell growth and differentiation by acting through different signaling pathways (22.Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). Increased levels of proteoglycans with altered composition have been reported in human tumors, primarily those of epithelial origin, such as breast, colon, and lung. Bamacan proteoglycan has been shown to be a normal constituent of the basement membranes in several tissues (3.McCarthy K.J. Accavitti M.A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3187-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and is, thus, plausible that its secretion is a physiological event. Whether abnormal accumulation of extracellular bamacan occurs during tumor formation and the exact extracellular function of this protein needs to be established in future studies.In conclusion, our results support the concept that overexpression of bamacan/SMC3 alone is sufficient to initiate cell transformation in normal fibroblasts. Thus, abnormal expression of bamacan/SMC3 gene may disrupt the formation of the multimeric protein complexes within the nucleus which could directly contribute to the genesis of a transformed phenotype. Originally isolated from the embryonic parietal yolk sac as a high density chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan (1.Iozzo R.V. Clark C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 6658-6669Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2.Iozzo R.V. Clark C.C. Histochemistry. 1987; 88: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), bamacan was subsequently identified to be a component of the renal mesangial matrix (3.McCarthy K.J. Accavitti M.A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3187-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), the basement membrane of other tissues (4.McCarthy K.J. Bynum K.R. St. John P.L. Abrahamson D.R. Couchman J.R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1993; 41: 401-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), and tumor matrix (5.Couchman J.R. Kapoor R. Sthanam M. Wu R.-R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9595-9602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The murine protein is encoded by 31 exons distributed along ∼45 kilobase pairs of genomic DNA (6.Ghiselli G. Siracusa L. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17384-17393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and is highly conserved across species (7.Wu R.-R. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 433-444Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 8.Stursberg S. Riwar B. Jessberger R. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 9.Shimizu K. Shirataki H. Honda T. Minami S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6591-6594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Secondary structure analysis of the protein reveals three globular domains intercalated by two α-helix coiled-coils in an antiparallel arrangement folded at a flexible hinge (10.Melby T.E. Ciampaglio C.N. Briscoe G. Erickson H.P. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1595-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). The terminal ends harbor five glycanation sites to which the attachment of glycosaminoglycan side GAG chains is possible, and a P-loop and a DA-box motif that may act cooperatively to bind ATP and DNA, respectively (11.Strunnikov A. Jessberger R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These features and the high sequence homology with the structural maintenance of chromosome 3 (SMC3)1 protein led us to conclude that bamacan is a member of this family (6.Ghiselli G. Siracusa L. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17384-17393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). SMC3 proteins are involved in the formation of at least two multimeric complexes within the nucleus. The first, termed “cohesin”, is involved in chromosome cohesion and prevents premature sister chromatid separation (12.Michaelis C. Ciosk R. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1999; 91: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). The second, called RC-1, is involved in DNA repair and has DNA ligase and polymerase activity (13.Jessberger R. Podust V. Hübscher U. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15070-15079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of a third complex has been postulated on the basis that bamacan/SMC3 can be co-isolated with proteins involved in microtubule dynamics (9.Shimizu K. Shirataki H. Honda T. Minami S. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6591-6594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Finally, the protein has a functional leucine zipper domain that binds Mxi and Max, two nuclear proteins that interact with Myc and modulate its transcriptional activity (14.Gupta K. Anand G. Yin X. Grove L. Prochownik E.V. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 1149-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We previously detected increased bamacan/SMC3 mRNA levels in several transformed cell lines (6.Ghiselli G. Siracusa L. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17384-17393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), suggesting that the amplified product of the normal gene may play a role in tumorigenesis. To directly test this hypothesis we investigated the effects of transgenic overexpression of bamacan/SMC3 in NIH and Balb/c 3T3 mouse fibroblasts. All the cells overexpressing bamacan/SMC3 showed evidence of transformation, including anchorage-independent growth and foci of transformation. Moreover, all the stably transfected clones exhibited increased levels of bamacan/SMC3 identical to those of spontaneously transformed human colon carcinoma cell lines and colon cancer specimens, as well as intestinal tumors from Apc-deficientMin/+ mice. Thus, deregulated expression of bamacan/SMC3 may be directly linked to the complex process of oncogenesis. DISCUSSIONThe results of this study strengthen the notion that bamacan/SMC3 may play an important role in tumorigenesis (6.Ghiselli G. Siracusa L. Iozzo R.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17384-17393Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The degree of gene activation that leads to cell transformation in normal mouse cells is comparable with that observed in a series of colon carcinomas cell lines and in the majority of human colon carcinoma specimens. The average 4-fold increase supports the idea that bamacan/SMC3 biosynthesis is tightly regulated in normal cells and that an imbalance in the amounts of this protein can directly affect the transformation program.Several functional roles have been assigned to eukaryotic bamacan/SMC3 for which it is possible to envision mechanisms linking its overexpression to cell growth disregulation. The involvement of this protein in chromatid cohesion during metaphase points to a first mechanism (18.Darwiche N. Freeman L.A. Strunnikov A. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 233: 39-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The protein is part of the cohesin multimeric protein complex that prevents the premature separation of sister chromatids (12.Michaelis C. Ciosk R. Nasmyth K. Cell. 1999; 91: 35-45Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). This process occurs in an orderly fashion during anaphase under the control of the cell cycle machinery and, if improperly executed, could result in the segregation of both sisters to the same cell thereby generating an aneuploid karyotype (19.Farr K.A. Cohen-Fix O. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 263: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Bamacan/SMC3 is also a necessary component, together with SMC1, of a multimeric complex named RC1 that has DNA recombination/renaturation, DNA ligase, and DNA polymerase activities (13.Jessberger R. Podust V. Hübscher U. Berg P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15070-15079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymes act in concert to repair a gapped or deleted DNA. These different functions of bamacan/SMC3 are mediated by its ability to bind palindromic DNA sequences through its C terminus and by allowing the formation of protein-DNA structures that are accessible to the action of DNA-modifying enzymes (20.Akhmedov A.T. Gross B. Jessberger R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38216-38224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 21.Moghal N. Sternberg P.W. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 190-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar).The functional significance of proteoglycan core protein in the nucleus and at the same time extracellularly eludes a simple interpretation. Proteoglycans can affect cell growth and differentiation by acting through different signaling pathways (22.Iozzo R.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 609-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1332) Google Scholar). Increased levels of proteoglycans with altered composition have been reported in human tumors, primarily those of epithelial origin, such as breast, colon, and lung. Bamacan proteoglycan has been shown to be a normal constituent of the basement membranes in several tissues (3.McCarthy K.J. Accavitti M.A. Couchman J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 3187-3198Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and is, thus, plausible that its secretion is a physiological event.

https://openalex.org/W2011563683,"To investigate the possible roles of the Ras/Rho family members in the inside-out signals to activate integrins, we examined the ability of Ras/Rho small GTPases to stimulate avidity of α5β1 (VLA-5) to fibronectin in bone marrow-derived mast cells. We found that both Ha-RasVal-12 and R-RasVal-38 had strong stimulatory effects on adhesion and ligand binding activity of VLA-5 to fibronectin. However, only Ha-RasVal-12-, but not R-RasVal-38-induced adhesion was inhibited by wortmannin, which suggests that Ha-RasVal-12 is dependent on phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase on adhesion whereas R-RasVal-38 has another PI 3-kinase independent pathway to induce adhesion. The effector loop mutant Ha-RasVal-12E37G, but not Y40C retained the ability to stimulate adhesion of mast cells to fibronectin. Consistently, PI 3-kinase p110δ, predominantly expressed in mast cells, interacted with Ha-RasVal-12 E37G, but not Y40C, which was also correlated with the levels of Akt phosphorylation in mast cells. Furthermore, marked adhesion was induced by a membrane-targeted version of p110δ. These results indicate that Ha-RasVal-12 activated VLA-5 through PI 3-kinase p110δ. The mutational effects of the R-Ras effector loop region on adhesion were not correlated with PI 3-kinase activities, consistent with our contention that R-Ras has a distinct pathway to modulate avidity of VLA-5.

Adhesive interactions through integrins are modulated by adhesiveness (avidity) as well as expressions of integrins (1.Ruoslahti E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1988; 57: 375-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar, 2.Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9023) Google Scholar). Although both types of regulations are important, avidity modulation of integrins in particular plays a critical role in leukocyte migration and localization during inflammatory responses (3.Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 827-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar). Several external stimuli were reported to modulate avidity of integrins without changes of integrin expressions, such as antigen, chemokines, and cytokines (3.Springer T.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1995; 57: 827-872Crossref PubMed Scopus (1397) Google Scholar, 4.Levesque J.P. Haylock D.N. Simmons P.J. Blood. 1996; 88: 1168-1176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5.Wei J. Shaw L.M. Mercurio A.M. J. Leuk. Biol. 1997; 61: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A rapid change of avidity of integrins occurs within minutes and is triggered by intracellular signaling pathways, which are referred to as inside-out signals (6.Springer T.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 425-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (5857) Google Scholar). Avidity modulation of integrins is regulated by increasing affinity to ligands, or by spatial redistribution of integrins on cell surface, which increases the number of integrins on the contact site (7.Lub M. van Kooyk Y. Figdor C.G. Immunol. Today. 1995; 16: 479-483Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 8.Stewart M. Hogg N. J. Cell.

Kraeft S.-K. Chen L.B. Sheetz M.P. Hemler M.E. J. Exp. Med. 1997; 186: 1347-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Which types of avidity regulations are utilized largely depends on stimuli that induce adhesion. PMA1 enhanced adhesion without detectable change in ligand-binding affinity of integrins (11.Danilov Y.N. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1925-1933Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 12.Faull R.J. Kovach N.L. Harlan J.M. Ginsberg M.H. J. Exp.

Chem. 1993; 268: 21693-21700Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have shown that an increase in lateral diffusion and clustering of integrins by PMA or cytochalasin D at low doses facilitates adhesion (10.Yauch R.L. Felsenfeld D.P. Kraeft S.-K.

Invest. 1996; 97: 2139-2144Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), suggesting that the adhesion is mediated by low affinity, but multivalent bindings of integrins. On the other hand, affinity modulation in integrins detected with soluble ligands or antibodies recognizing the high affinity state was reported for α4β1, α5β1, αLβ2, and αIIbβ3 integrins in cells stimulated with activating antibodies, manganese ions, or cross-linking of the T cell receptor (12.Faull R.J.

We previously demonstrated that PMA-stimulated mast cells adhered to fibronectin without accompanying affinity modulation of VLA-5, while FcεRI cross-linked mast cells adhered to fibronectin by the high affinity state of VLA-5. Steel factor-induced adhesion was considered to be brought by both mechanisms (20.Kinashi T. Asaoka T. Setoguchi R. Takatsu K. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2850-2857PubMed Google Scholar). Changes in the affinity state of integrins influenced cell migratory speeds on substrates (21.Palecek S.P. Loftus J.C. Ginsberg M.H. Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Nature. 1997; 385: 537-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (1192) Google Scholar). However, the physiological significance of two modes of avidity modulation has not yet been demonstrated clearly. The Ras/Rho family of small GTPases regulates the actin cytoskeleton and contributes to the formation of membrane ruffling and focal adhesion (22.Clark E.A. King W.G. Brugge J.S. Symons M. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 573-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 23.Nobes C.D. Hall A. Cell. 1995; 81: 53-62Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3744) Google Scholar). Cytoskeletal reorganization subsequent to attachment to substrate leads to marked cell shape changes and strengthens adhesive interactions. Several members of the Ras/Rho family have been reported to influence integrin-mediated adhesion. Ha-Ras was shown to suppress the active form of αIIbβ3 chimeras through the MAP kinase pathway (24.Hughes P.E. Renshaw M.W. Pfaff M. Forsyth J. Keivens V.M. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Cell. 1997; 88: 521-530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). A constitutively active R-Ras was found to enhance cellular adhesion to fibronectin by enhancing β1-integrin ligand-binding affinity (25.Zang Z. Vuori K. Wang H.-G. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that Rap1 has a unique property that causes an increase of ligand binding affinity of the β2 integrin LFA-1, and that Rap1 was critically involved in T-cell receptor-mediated LFA-1/ICAM-1 adhesion (26.Katagiri K. Hattori M. Minato N. Irie S. Takatsu K. Kinashi T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1956-1969Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). However, there are few comprehensive studies that examine whether or not the Ras/Rho family of small GTPases can modulate avidity of β1 integrins directly. To gain a clearer understanding of avidity regulations of β1 integrins by the Ras/Rho family of small GTPases, we employed bone marrow-derived mast cells as a model system to analyze their ability to modulate avidity of VLA-5, because mast cells have been shown to adhere to fibronectin through VLA-5 upon physiologically relevant stimulation such as steel factor (27.Kinashi T. Springer T.A. Blood. 1994; 83: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), or antigen cross-linking of FcεRI (20.Kinashi T. Asaoka T. Setoguchi R. Takatsu K. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2850-2857PubMed Google Scholar) and are considered to be suitable for activation signal-dependent adhesion. With mast cells, one can also examine the affinity state of VLA-5 as we demonstrated that with antigen cross-linking of FcεRI (20.Kinashi T. Asaoka T. Setoguchi R. Takatsu K. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2850-2857PubMed Google Scholar). Here we report that the active mutants of Ha-Ras and R-Ras among the Ras/Rho family member lead to strong adhesion to fibronectin with the high affinity state of VLA-5. Furthermore, our study reveals distinct mechanisms of Ha-Ras and R-Ras in regulation of avidity of VLA-5 through analyses of effector mutants and constitutively active downstream signaling molecules: PI 3-kinase p110δ is critical to avidity modulation by Ha-Ras, while R-Ras has other mechanisms to regulate avidity of VLA-5. Primary bone marrow-derived mast cell cultures were carried out as described (27.Kinashi T. Springer T.A. Blood. 1994; 83: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Primary mast cells were used from 4 to 10 weeks of culture after establishment. Retrovirus-mediated transfection was employed to introduce cDNAs into mast cells as using GP+E86 packaging cells (28.Kinashi T. Escobedo J.A. Williams L.T. Takatsu K. Springer T.A. Blood. 1995; 86: 2086-2090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The anti-mouse VLA-5 monoclonal antibody MFR-5 (5H10–27) (29.Kinashi T. Springer T.A.

Wortmannin (Wako Pure Chemical Ltd., Tokyo, Japan), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), recombinant murine steel factor (Genzyme, Boston, MA), and β-estradiol (Sigma) were purchased. Constitutively active Ha-Ras, R-Ras, Rap1A, RalA, Rac, and Rho mutants were produced from their cDNAs by a single point mutation; substitution of glycine with valine at position 12 (Ha-RasVal-12, RacVal-12, and Rap1Val-12) (Rap1Val-12 was a gift from Drs. M. Hattori and N. Minato, Kyoto University), position 38 (R-RasVal-38), and position 14 (RhoVal-14, a gift from Dr. S. Narumiya, Kyoto University), substitution of glutamic acid for leucine at position 72 (RalA-E72L, a gift from Dr. H. Koide, Tokyo Institute of Technology). Epitope tags were attached at the amino-terminal end of the mutant small GTPases (Myc epitope tag for RacVal-12 and RhoVal-14, T7 epitope tag for Rap1). Effector loop mutants of Ha-RasVal-12 (T35S, E37G, D38E, and Y40C) were described (31.Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Papppin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). To make effector loop mutants of R-RasVal-38, polymerase chain reaction was used with R-RasVal-38 as a template to introduce a point mutation; substitution of threonine with serine at position 61 (E61S), glutamic acid with glycine at position 63 (E63G), asparatic acid with glutamic acid at position 64 (D64E), and tyrosine with cysteine at position 66 (Y66C). p110δ-CAAX was made by attaching the 20 carboxyl-terminal amino acids (KMSKDGKKKKKKSKTKCVIM) of K-Ras as described for Raf-CAAX (32.Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar) to the 3′ end of p110δ by polymerase chain reaction. All cDNAs were verified by sequencing both strands, and subcloned into a retrovirus vector pMX-neo to introduce into mast cells, or pSG5 (Strategene, La Jolla, CA) for COS7 cells. cDNAs encoding for rafER (33.Samuels M.L.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6748-6761Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar), and Raf-CAAX (32.Leevers S.J. Paterson H.F. Marshall C.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar) were also subcloned into pMX-neo. Fibronectin and its 80-kDa tryptic fragment that contains the RGD binding motif for VLA-5 were produced as described (35.Forsyth J. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 215: 311-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 36.Garcia-Pardo A. Ferreira O.C. Valinsky J. Bianco C. Exp. Cell. Res. 1989; 181: 420-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The 80-kDa fibronectin fragment was radioiodinated with a modified method using chloramine T (37.McConahey P.J. Dixon F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 70: 210-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The typical specific activity of the labeled 80-kDa fragment used in our experiments was about 3.5 × 108 dpm/nmol. Its binding to cells was measured as described (20.Kinashi T. Asaoka T. Setoguchi R. Takatsu K. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2850-2857PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, mast cells were washed once with binding buffer containing RPMI 1640 (Sigma), 0.1% BSA (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (Sigma), and suspended with the same buffer at 1 × 107 cells/ml. In a typical binding assay, performed in a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, 100 μl of cells (1 × 106 cells per tube) were mixed with 100 μl of the radiolabeled 80-kDa fragment. For inhibition with antibodies or wortmannin, mast cells were preincubated with antibodies (20 μg/ml), or wortmannin for 15 min at 25 °C before assays. After incubation for 30 min at 37 °C, samples were oil-separated by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 1 min. The tip of tubes was amputated from the body with a blade and applied to a γ-counter to measure radioactivity of the bound (the tip) and the unbound (the body). The nonspecific binding was determined at each data point in the presence of a 50-fold excess of the unlabeled 80-kDa fragment. The specific binding was calculated by subtracting the nonspecific binding from the total binding. Cells (1 × 106) were incubated on ice for 30 min with 50 μl of staining buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% BSA, 0.05% sodium azide) containing 1 μg of monoclonal Rat anti-VLA-5 antibody (MFR-5H10) or isotype-matched rat antibody. After washing with staining buffer three times, cells were stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-Rat IgG as above. The stained cells were analyzed by FACScan (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Assays of adhesion to fibronectin were performed as described (27.Kinashi T. Springer T.A. Blood. 1994; 83: 1033-1038Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, mast cells labeled with 2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) in 96-well plates precoated with fibronectin (1 μg/well) or 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) were incubated in triplicate at 37 °C for 30 min, or in the presence of PMA as indicated. After washing the plate four times, bound fluorescence was measured with a fluorescence concentration analyzer (IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, ME). The level of adhesion was calculated by dividing bound fluorescence by input fluorescence. For the assay with antibodies or wortmannin, labeled mast cells were preincubated at room temperature for 15 min with 20 μg/ml antibodies or wortmannin as indicated before assays. Mast cells were prepared for cell lysates as described (28.Kinashi T. Escobedo J.A. Williams L.T. Takatsu K. Springer T.A. Blood. 1995; 86: 2086-2090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Following SDS-PAGE, the separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. After blocking with 5% BSA, the membrane was incubated with antibodies as indicated and detected with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. The bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Stripping and reprobing were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. For detection of Myc-tagged Raf-CAAX or, HA-tagged Rlf-CAAX, cell lysates (5 × 106 cells) were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc (9E10) or anti-HA (12CA5) antibodies and subjected to Western blotting detected with anti-Raf (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) or anti-HA antibodies. For detection of p110δ-CAAX, cells (5 × 105 cells) were suspended with SDS sample buffer, and briefly sonicated and boiled before SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Cos7 cells were transfected with Ha-Ras mutants (5 μg) and Myc-tagged p110δ (5 μg). After 48 h, cells were harvested and lyzed with lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mmTris, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 15% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μmaprotinin). Immunoprecipitation was performed using anti-Myc epitope antibody (9E10) or anti-Ras antibody (Y13–238, Oncogene Science, Uniondale NY). Immunocomplexes were collected with protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and washed with lysis buffer three times. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting were performed as above. Blots were incubated with anti-p110δ antibody (30.Vanhaesebroeck B. Welham M.J. Kotani K. Stein R. Warne P.H. Zvelebil M.J. Higashi K. Volinia S. Downward J. Waterfield M.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4330-4335Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar) or anti-Ras antibody (Transduction Laboratories). Mast cells (5 × 106 cells) that introduced rafER were stimulated with estradiol (1 μm) or steel factor (10 units/ml) at 37 °C for 30 min. Cells were lyzed with lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 μmaprotinin). Cell lysates were incubated with 1 μg of anti-ERK2 antibody (Santa-Cruz). Immunocomplexes were collected with protein G-Sepharose. Immune complex kinase assays were performed with myelin basic protein (Sigma) as a substrate (33.Samuels M.L. Weber M.J. Bishop J.M. McMahon M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6241-6255Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). The levels of phosphorylation of myelin basic protein were quantitated with a PhosphorImager (BAS1000, Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). To examine the ability of the Ras/Rho small GTPases to modulate avidity of VLA-5 to fibronectin, we established bone marrow-derived mast cells by culturing bone marrow cells with interleukin-3 for 4 weeks, and then introduced active forms of Ha-Ras (Ha-RasVal-12), Rap1 (T7-tagged Rap1Val-12), RalA (RalALeu-72), R-Ras (Myc-tagged R-RasVal-38), Rac (Myc-tagged RacVal-12), Rho (Myc-tagged RhoVal-14), or neomycin only by retrovirus. Following drug selection, we examined adhesion of these transfectants to fibronectin. Control mast cells (neo) and uninfected mast cells did not adhere to fibronectin significantly when compared with BSA (Fig.1). However, cells expressing Ha-RasVal-12 and R-RasVal-38 adhered strongly to fibronectin without stimulation. In both cases, adhesion to fibronectin was blocked by an anti-VLA-5 antibody, 5H10, indicating that adhesion was mediated by VLA-5 (Fig. 1). Adhesion to fibronectin was also induced slightly in Rap1Val-12 or RacVal-12 expressing cells, which was inhibited with anti-VLA-5 antibody, but RalALeu-72 or RhoVal-14 transfectants did not change the level of adhesion significantly. Expressions of VLA-5 of transfectants were similar to control cells (Neo) (Fig.2 A), or uninfected cells (not shown). We demonstrated expression of introduced active forms of the Ras/Rho small GTPases in mast cells by Western blot analysis (Fig.2 B). These results indicated that adhesiveness of VLA-5 was increased in cells expressing Ha-RasVal-12 and R-RasVal-38. Transfectants expressing Rap1Val-12, RalALeu-72, RacVal-12, or RhoVal-14 adhered to fibronectin when stimulated with steel factor or PMA, indicating that these active forms of small GTPases did not exert inhibitory effects on activation-dependent adhesion of mast cells (data not shown).Figure 2A, expressions of VLA-5 in mast cell transfectants. Mast cells transfected with genes as indicated were stained with control (open) or anti-mouse monoclonal VLA-5 (filled) antibodies followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary antibody and FACS analysis.B, expressions of active forms of small GTPases transfected into mast cells. Total lysates from cells transfected with the neomycin gene (left lane) and cDNA encoding active forms of small GTPases (right lane) were subjected to SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride filters, and immunoblotted with anti-Ras antibody (Ha-RasVal-12, 21 kDa), anti-T7 antibody (Rap1Val-12, 27 kDa), anti-RalA antibody (RalALeu-72, 24 kDa), anti-R-Ras antibody (R-RasVal-38, 28 kDa), anti-Myc antibody for RacVal-12 (28 kDa), and RhoVal-14 (29 kDa).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) R-RasVal-38 was previously shown to augment ligand binding activity to fibronectin (25.Zang Z. Vuori K. Wang H.-G. Reed J.C. Ruoslahti E. Cell. 1996; 85: 61-69Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). To examine whether ligand binding activities of VLA-5 are augmented in cells expressing Ha-RasVal-12 and R-RasVal-38, we measured ligand-binding affinity using a soluble 80-kDa fibronectin fragment (FN80) containing the RGD motif that was recognized by VLA-5. We previously demonstrated that ligand bindings of unstimulated mast cells was low, but increased by FcεRI cross-linking, but not PMA stimulation (20.Kinashi T. Asaoka T. Setoguchi R. Takatsu K. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2850-2857PubMed Google Scholar). In mast cells expressing either Ha-RasVal-12 or R-RasVal-38, ligand bindings were augmented compared with those of control cells (Fig. 3). The level of ligand bindings of cells expressing Ha-RasVal-12 was higher than that in R-RasVal-38 expressing cells. The increased ligand bindings were inhibited by anti-VLA-5 antibody, indicating that ligand binding activity of VLA-5 was increased in these cells. To explore whether PI 3-kinase is involved in affinity modulation of VLA-5 by Ha-RasVal-12 and R-RasVal-38, as is the case in mast cells stimulated with FcεRI cross-linking (20.Kinashi T. Asaoka T. Setoguchi R. Takatsu K. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 2850-2857PubMed Google Scholar), ligand binding assays were performed in the presence of wortmannin. Bindings to FN80 in both Ha-RasVal-12 and R-RasVal-38 expressing cells were completely inhibited with low doses of wortmannin (Fig. 3) or LY294002 (data not shown), suggesting that PI 3-kinase is involved in affinity modulation by Ha-RasVal-12 and R-RasVal-38. Wortmannin also inhibited adhesion of Ha-RasVal-12 expressing cells to fibronectin at a concentration similar to those abolished bindings to FN80 (Fig.4). On the other hand, adhesion of R-RasVal-38 expressing cells was resistant to treatment of wortmannin even at 100 nm, the dose of which completely blocked the bindings to FN80 (Fig. 3). LY294002 also failed to inhibit adhesion to fibronectin (data not shown). Anti-VLA-5 inhibited adhesion of R-RasVal-38 expressing cells to fibronectin in the presence of wortmannin (Fig. 4). These results indicate that the high affinity state of VLA-5 by PI 3-kinase likely accounted for adhesion induced by Ha-RasVal-12, while R-RasVal-38-induced adhesions were mostly independent from PI 3-kinase activities, and did not require the high affinity state of VLA-5 for adhesion. Point mutations in the effector loop region of the active form of Ha-Ras was reported to selectively inhibit the interaction and activation of downstream signal molecules such as Raf, RalGDS, and PI 3-kinase (38.Rodriguez V.P. Warne P.H. Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Downward J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2442-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (501) Google Scholar). Raf was shown to interact only with Ha-RasVal-12 T35S and Ha-RasVal-12D38E, and RalGDS and PI 3-kinase p110α interacted only with Ha-RasVal-12 E37G and Y40C, respectively. To confirm PI 3-kinase dependence of Ha-Ras for adhesion, mast cells expressing Ha-RasVal-12, T35S (Ser35), E37G (Gly37), D38E (Glu38), or Y40C (Cys40) were established (Fig.5 B). There were no significant changes in surface levels of VLA-5 in these transfectants (data not shown). Contrary to our expectation, cells expressing the Gly37, but not Cys40 mutant showed the levels of adhesion equivalent to, or more than, cells expressing Ha-RasVal-12, whereas those of adhesion of mast cells expressing the Ser35, Glu38, or Cys40 mutants were reduced considerably (Fig.5 A). We also examined the phosphorylation of Akt in effector mutant expressing cells as its phosphorylation is dependent on activities of PI 3-kinase (39.Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1997; 88: 435-437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1528) Google Scholar). The level of Akt phosphorylation was augmented only in mast cells expressing the Gly37mutant, the level of which was more than that of the Val12mutant (Fig. 5 C). The Ser35 slightly increased Akt phosphorylation compared with control (Fig. 5 C). The phosphorylation of Akt was completely abolished with treatment of wortmannin, confirming the requirement of PI 3-kinase activity for Akt phosphorylation (data not shown). Thus the levels of Akt phosphorylation were in good correlation with those of adhesion to fibronectin (Fig. 5 C), which is consistent with the notion that PI 3-kinase is critically involved downstream of Ha-Ras for adhesion, and suggest that the interaction of Ha-Ras and PI 3-kinase occurs in the Gly37, but not Cys40 mutants in mast cells. To confirm the possibility that the Gly37, but not Cys40 mutant associates with PI 3-kinase in mast cells, we examined the isotypes of the p110 catalytic subunit that were expressed in mast cells. Mast cells expressed predominantly p110δ, while p110α and β were barely detected (Fig.6 A). The interactions of Ha-Ras effector mutants and Myc-tagged p110δ were examined by co-transfection into COS cells and immunoprecipitation with either anti-Myc antibody (Fig. 6 B) or anti-Ha-Ras antibody (Fig.6 C) for associations with Ha-Ras mutants or p110δ, respectively. In both cases, p110δ was co-immunoprecipitated with the Gly37 as efficiently as Ha-RasVal-12. This result is consistent with strong Akt phosphorylation in the Gly37 expressing mast cells (Fig. 5 C). To directly demonstrate that p110δ itself is sufficient to induce adhesion to fibronectin, we introduced an activated membrane-targeted version of p110δ, p110δ-CAAX, into mast cells. We also tested membrane-targeted versions of two known effector molecules that bind to Ha-Ras, Raf-CAAX and Rlf-CAAX (Fig.7 A). Mast cells expressing p110δ-CAAX strongly adhere to fibronectin without stimulation. In contrast, cells expressing Raf-CAA"

Defective XDH activity elevates xanthine concentration in plasma and urine, whereas hypoxanthine can be salvaged to inosine by hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase. XDH requires molybdopterin cofactor (also referred as molybdenum cofactor, MoCo) for its enzymic activity. The cofactor is also essential for the enzymic activities of aldehyde oxidase (AO) and sulfite oxidase (SO) in mammals (1.Simmonds J.A. Reiter S. Nishino T. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S.

Therefore, it was hypothesized that theDrosophila ma-l gene encodes a putative enzyme that catalyzes sulfuration of desulfo MoCo, the last step of MoCo synthesis. XDH deficiency in humans results in xanthinuria and the accumulation of xanthine calculi in renal tubules that leads to renal dysfunction (1.Simmonds J.A. Reiter S. Nishino T. Scriver C.R.

Loss-of-function mutations in the XDH gene and genes responsible for MoCo biosynthesis can result in xanthinuria. In fact, hereditary xanthinuria in humans is classified into three categories (1.Simmonds J.A. Reiter S. Nishino T. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D.

Amaya Y. Kamatani N. Nishino T. Hosoya T. Sakai O. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 2391-2397Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Xanthinuria type II lacks both XDH and AO activities (1.Simmonds J.A. Reiter S. Nishino T. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease.

The third category is found in MoCo deficiency produced by a loss-of-function mutation of the MoCo synthetase gene catalyzing the first steps in MoCo synthesis (10.Reiss J. Cohen N. Dorche C.

In humans, this condition is lethal in the perinatal period due to the absence of SO activity, which catalyzes sulfite oxidation (2.Johnson J.L. Wadman S.K. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S.

Here, we show that this form of bovine xanthinuria is an autosomal recessive trait by which affected cattle lose XDH and AO activities, although SO activity is preserved, suggesting that this disorder is xanthinuria type II (1.Simmonds J.A.

A mouse EST, AA450702, corresponding to Pro-499 → Val-622 of Drosophila Ma-l, was chosen to design PCR primers (545F, 5′-GACCGGAGCTGGATGGTTGTG-3′; 596R, 5′-CCTCAAGAGGCACCTGGATAGG-3′) to amplify a ma-l homologous fragment by RT-PCR using bovine liver mRNA. A 150-bp PCR product corresponding to Asp-545 → Asp-596 of Drosophila Ma-l was confirmed by direct sequencing. We subsequently designed PCR primers (552F, 5′-ATCACAACGGCATTTGCCTGA-3′; 588R, 5′-CTCCATCCCTTGGGCTTTGATGAC-3′) from the bovine partial cDNA sequence to amplify a 110-bp fragment corresponding to Asp-552 → Ile-588 of Drosophila Ma-l using bovine genomic DNA. Direct sequencing revealed the PCR product was identical to the corresponding part of the bovine cDNA sequence. A bovine YAC clone 13H10 was screened by a PCR-based method as described (17.Takeda H.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1651-1654Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) using reagents supplied in the Oncor® chromosome in situ kit. YAC 13H10 was also used to construct a cosmid library. Briefly, YAC DNA (20 μg) was partially digested with Sau3AI. The resulting 20–30-kilobase fragments were collected by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by ligation into the pWE15 cosmid vector. Microsatellite loci from a cosmid clone were isolated using a poly(dA·dC)·poly(dG·dT) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) probe as described (13.Hirano T. Nakane S. Mizoshita K. Yamakuchi H.

The following primer pairs were synthesized for DIK-124: forward, 5′-GCTAAATAAACCCTGTAGTGTTG-3′; reverse, 5′-GAGGGCAGTGTCTCAGGAGGGA-3′. Total RNA was extracted from bovine liver with Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) and reverse-transcribed with SuperScript II (Life Technologies, Inc.). 5′- and 3′-RACE reactions were performed with primers designed from the bovine cDNA sequence using the 5′-RACE kit (Life Technologies, Inc.) and SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH), respectively. To detect the Tyr-257 deletion, PCR primers (714F, 5′-TGGCCTGGGCGCTCTGCTGGTGAATAAC-3′; 800R, 5′-AGGTACGCAGCGGCCGTGCCTCCTC-3′) were prepared to amplify the normal (87 bp) and mutant (84 bp) alleles using Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene), to avoid 3′-terminal adenylation and to make electropherograms clear, followed by separation with a 12% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The GenBankTM accession number for bovine MCSU cDNA is AB036422. Bovine xanthinuria in a local herd of Japanese Black cattle was characterized by elevated xanthine secretion in the urine associated with lethal growth retardation at approximately 6 months of age (11.Mizoguchi H. Livestock Technol. (Japan). 1997; 509: 2-6Google Scholar). Affected cattle had expanded renal tubules containing xanthine calculi ranging from 1–3 mm in diameter (11.Mizoguchi H. Livestock Technol. (Japan). 1997; 509: 2-6Google Scholar). We confirmed that more than 300 xanthinuria-affected cattle have been recorded over the last 20 years and that all parents were descendants of a putative founder sire. Affected male, female, and unknown offspring numbered 177, 148, and 9, respectively. Pedigree analysis in this herd indicates that bovine xanthinuria is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Three types of xanthinuria can be classified based on the activities of the MoCo-requiring enzymes XDH, AO, and SO (1.Simmonds J.A. Reiter S. Nishino T. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 1781-1797Google Scholar, 2.Johnson J.L. Wadman S.K. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 2271-2283Google Scholar). We found that XDH and AO activities in liver extracts were decreased in affected cattle, whereas SO activity was preserved (Fig.1 A). Therefore, we classified this type of bovine xanthinuria as xanthinuria type II (1.Simmonds J.A. Reiter S. Nishino T. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. The Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Inherited Disease. McGraw-Hill, New York1995: 1781-1797Google Scholar, 9.Reiter S. Simmonds H.A. Zollner N. Braun S.L. Knedel M. Clin. Chim.

Twenty-one xanthinuria type II-affected offspring (11 males and 10 females) and their parents, 21 dams and two sires, were collected (Fig.1 B) and subjected to linkage analysis. A battery of 200 markers (12.Kappes S.M. Keele J.W. Stone R.T. McGraw R.A. Sonstegard T.S. Smith T.P. Lopez-Corrales N.L. Beattie C.W. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) covering all bovine autosomes at approximately 15-centimorgan intervals, and showing heterozygosity for at least one of the two sires, was used in an initial genome scan in the family segregated for the disorder. The putative xanthinuria type II locus was mapped at the centromeric region of bovine chromosome (BTA) 24 (Z = 36.6, p < 1.9 × 10−6) (Fig. 1 C) (14.Kruglyak L. Daly M.J. Reeve-Daly M.P. Lander E.S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1996; 58: 1347-1363PubMed Google Scholar). Because the Drosophila ma-l orthologue, putative MoCo sulfurase gene has been suggested as causative for xanthinuria type II (4.Finnerty V. McCarron M. Johnson G.B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1979; 172: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 5.Bogaart A.M. Bernini L.F. Biochem. Genet. 1981; 19: 929-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 6.Kamdar K.P. Primus J.P. Shelton M.E. Archangeli L.L. Wittle A.E. Finnerty V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we investigated whether bovine Drosophila ma-lorthologue is located at the same region of xanthinuria type II locus on BTA24. The deduced amino acid sequence encoded byDrosophila ma-l (GenBankTM accession numberAF162681; kindly provided by Victoria Finnerty, Emory University, Atlanta, GA) was subjected to a TBLASTN-search on the dbEST DNA sequence data base of the GenBankTM to collect ESTs derived from mammalian orthologues. One hundred ESTs showing more than 40% identity to the ma-l amino acid sequence were obtained. A mouse EST (AA450702) was chosen to design PCR primers (552F and 588R) to amplify a ma-l homologous fragment using bovine genomic DNA. The direct sequencing of a 110-bp PCR product confirmed the Asp-552 → Ile-588 of Drosophila Ma-l. The bovineDrosophila ma-l orthologue was physically mapped by FISH using a bovine YAC clone 13H10 identified by PCR-based screening with the 552F and 588R primers. The YAC clone harboring the ma-lorthologue was located at BTA24q13.1–13.3 by FISH (Fig.1 D), where the xanthinuria type II locus genetically mapped (Fig. 1 C). MicrosatelliteDIK124 isolated from a cosmid clone harboring thema-l orthologue 110-bp DNA fragment was subjected to linkage analysis using the United States Department of Agriculture reference panel (12.Kappes S.M. Keele J.W. Stone R.T. McGraw R.A. Sonstegard T.S. Smith T.P. Lopez-Corrales N.L. Beattie C.W. Genome Res. 1997; 7: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar) and mapped closely to loci CSSM031 (θ = 0.00) and ILSTS065 (θ = 0.02) on BTA24 at the peak between 25 and 38 centimorgan in Fig. 1 C. These results strongly suggest that a bovine xanthinuria type II causative gene is the ma-l orthologue. To isolate a putative homologous Drosophila ma-l MoCo sulfurase gene, we extended the core fragment of the ma-lorthologue 110 bp using internal primers and bovine liver-derived cDNA in 5′- and 3′-RACE, respectively. We detected an open reading frame (ORF) with an in-frame upstream stop codon. The ORF has 2547 nucleotides and encodes a protein of 849 amino acids. Because the sequence revealed approximately 40% amino acid similarity toDrosophila ma-l (GenBankTM accession numberAF162681) and Aspergillus hxB (GenBankTMaccession number AF128114; Ref. 19.Amrani L. Cecchetto G. Scazzocchio C. Glatigny A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1065-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (Fig.2 A), we designated this gene as MoCo sulfurase (MCSU). Analysis of the genomic organization indicated that MCSU consists of at least 15 exons spanning 25 kilobases, with each exon flanked by canonical splice donor and acceptor sequences (Table I). We estimated MCSU expression by semiquantitative RT-PCR and demonstrated ubiquitous expression among diverse normal tissues (Fig.2 B). Normal lung tissue showed the highest expression. Affected cattle also expressed MCSU in the liver at levels equivalent to normal, suggesting that the level of MCSUexpression was not impaired. MCSU expression was not detected in normal tissues by Northern blot, probably because of a low level of expression.Table IIntron-exon boundary sequences of MCSUExoncDNA positionSplice acceptorSplice donor15′ UTR 435′ UTR - ATGCAAAGCACGGTCCCCAGgtgggaaaag244–133tttctttcagGAACTGTCTAAACGTTTATGgtaaagaaaa3134–201aaccttccagGTAACCCTCATGCGCTTCAGgtgagcaaat4202–847cttcttccagGATCCTGGCGTGGCTGAGAGgtaacctggt5848–925actgttgcagGTTTGAAGATCGCCTCACAGgtcagtggac6926–1126ctgctctgagGTGGGATGGATTACTCCCAGgtgggtttcc71127–1244aaacccatagGTGGATAAAAGCATCTTCAGgttggtactg81245–1707tttctcctagGCTGGTCATGAGCATTTGAGgtaagggttt91708–1871ttttttttagGTGATCAGGTAAAGCCCAAGgtcagaaaac101872–1951tgttcattagGGATGGAGCCGTGCGGACAGgtgagactgt111952–2077tttttgtcagGGTAAACACACATGGCAAAGgtattgcatt122078–2184ccttttttagATCAGTCTGCTAAGCACAAGgtaagaagac132185–2324tcttaaaaagCTGTGAGAATGCGTTTCCAGgtaagtttcc142325–2430caccgcccagGTTTTGGGACAGAGAGAAAGgtaagcatga152431–3′ UTRttgttcacagGTGAAGTTTGGGCTACCGAGTAA 3′ UTRThe intronic sequence is indicated in lowercase letters and the exonic sequence in uppercase. Open table in a new tab The intronic sequence is indicated in lowercase letters and the exonic sequence in uppercase. To detect a mutation associated with xanthinuria type II inMCSU, we compared ORF sequences from normal individuals with those from affected cattle. A two-base substitution at 478 and 479 resulting in the conversion of Pro-160 → Gly-160 was detected among normal cattle. This substitution is not related to the xanthinuria type II. A three-base deletion at 769–771 encoding Tyr-257 was identified in affected cattle (Fig. 3 A). PCR primers (714F and 800R) were designed to amplify the 87-bp fragment containing Tyr-257 using genomic DNA as template. Twenty-one affected offspring as shown in Fig. 1 B were demonstrated to harbor the homozygous Tyr-257 deleted 84-bp allele, whereas heterozygous 87- and 84-bp alleles were detected in their parents, which were expected carriers (Fig. 3 B). In contrast, more than 100 normal cattle from various cattle breeds, such as Japanese Black (unrelated to the xanthinuria type II founder sire), Limousine, Hereford, Holstein, and Angus, contained only the 87-bp normal alleles. This mutation detection method by simple PCR is applicable for practical diagnosis to detect heterozygous carrier cattle. To further address the issue of whether Tyr-257 is essential for MCSU function, MCSU sequences around Tyr-257 were compared between cattle, human, mouse, pig, fly, and fungus. Fig. 3 C shows that Tyr-257 was widely conserved and was situated in a highly conserved region in mammals. Even in the fly and fungus, two phenylalanine aromatic amino acid residues are preceded by basic amino acids and followed by a four-amino acid stretch, GGGT, conserved in mammals. These data strongly suggest that deletion of Tyr-257 results in the loss of MCSU function, leading to the occurrence of type II xanthinuria. Although we do not as yet have direct evidence demonstrating the enzymic nature of MCSU, loss-of-function mutations of ma-land hxB have been reported to be MoCo sulfuration-deficient in Drosophila and Aspergillus, respectively (7.Wahl R.C. Warner C.K. Finnerty V. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3958-3962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19.Amrani L. Cecchetto G. Scazzocchio C. Glatigny A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 1065-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). MoCo sulfuration activities of these gene products have not yet been confirmed biochemically. Wahl et al. (7.Wahl R.C. Warner C.K. Finnerty V. Rajagopalan K.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3958-3962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) reported that application of the resulfuration procedure to crude extracts ofDrosophila ma-l mutants reactivates XDH and AO and proposed that the mutants are defective in the sulfuration of desulfo MoCo. Interestingly, Ma-l protein has a weak homology to NifS protein, which is involved in nitrogen fixation of bacteria and has a transulfurase activity (6.Kamdar K.P. Primus J.P. Shelton M.E. Archangeli L.L. Wittle A.E. Finnerty V. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1997; 25: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). MCSU protein does not have significant homology to known proteins except for tRNA splicing protein SPL1 of Candida maltosa, sharing a 25.5% amino acid identity in the region from position 17 to 261 of MCSU. Twenty-one amino acid residues from 223 to 243 of MCSU (ADFVPISFYKIFGFPTGLGAL) have a similarity to the pyridoxal phosphate binding motif ((LIVFYCHT)-(DGH)-(LIVMFYAC)-(LIVMFYA)-x 2-(GSTAC)-(GSTA)-(HQR)-K-x 4, 6-G-x-(GSAT)-x-(LIVMFYSAC); Prosite motif ID, PS00595) such as that of C. maltosa SPL1 (IDLLSISSHKIYGPKGIGAC). Corresponding regions of Ma-l and HxB are highly conserved (PDYVCLSFYKIFGYPTGVGAL and PDFTVLSFYKIFGFPDLGAL, respectively). Because most enzymes that have transulfurase activity, such as cystathionine γ-lyase, require pyridoxal phosphate as a cofactor, we suggest that MCSU protein may bind pyridoxal phosphate and catalyze the transulfuration reaction of MoCo. Further investigation will be needed to confirm MCSU transulfurylase activity.

Schook and Craig W. Beattie for critical readings. We also thank Kazuo Hara, Haruko Takeda, and Shinji Hirotsune for valuable discussions."

We show that degradation required unfolding of the protein and was cytosol- and ATP-dependent and that dislocation and degradation required proteasome activity. When the interaction of heavy chain with calnexin was prevented, the rate of degradation was accelerated, suggesting that an interaction with calnexin stabilized heavy chain. Stabilization of heavy chain to degradation was also achieved either by preventing mannose trimming or by removal of theN-linked glycosylation site. This demonstrates that glycosylation and mannose trimming are required to ensure degradation of heavy chain. When degradation or mannose trimming was inhibited, heavy chain formed a prolonged interaction with immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein, ERp57, and protein disulfide isomerase. Taken together, these results indicate that calnexin association and mannose trimming provide a mechanism to regulate the folding, assembly, and degradation of glycoproteins entering the secretory pathway.

Helenius A. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). One consequence of this “quality control” is that retained proteins are selectively degraded by a mechanism that is distinct from lysosomal degradation and has previously been suggested to take place within the ER (2.Klausner R.D. Sitia R. Cell. 1990; 62: 611-614Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). It is now clear from a number of studies that this degradation takes place within the cytosol, is mediated by the proteasome, and requires dislocation of the polypeptide targeted for degradation from the ER to the cytosol (reviewed in Refs. 3.Kopito R. Cell. 1997; 88: 427-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar and 4.Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 151-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). However, it is not clear how the cell regulates the ER-associated degradation (ERAD) process or how proteins destined for degradation are transported from the ER to the proteasome. Several workers have tried to address these questions, and a consensus is emerging as to the sequence of events that results in the degradation of proteins originally located within the ER. Once translocated into the ER, newly synthesized polypeptides will normally fold and assemble to form native protein molecules that can be further transported to the Golgi apparatus. However, during conditions of stress (5.Knittler M.R. Dirks S. Haas I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 1764-1768Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), in the absence of interacting subunits (6.Yu H. Kaung G. Kobayashi S. Kopito R. J. Biol.

A similar process occurs when mutant proteins that are unable to fold correctly are expressed, either in yeast (9.Biederer T. Volkwein C. Sommer T. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2069-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 10.Werner E.D. Brodsky J.L. McCracken A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Degradation is coupled to dislocation, probably via the Sec61 complex, in a process believed to be the reverse of translocation into the ER. Evidence for the role of Sec61 complex in dislocation comes from both genetic (13.Plemper R.K. Bohmler S. Bordallo J. Sommer T. Wolf D.H.

Once dislocated to the cytosol, the polypeptide chains can then be degraded directly by the proteasome (6.Yu H. Kaung G. Kobayashi S. Kopito R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20800-20804Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) or can be deglycosylated (7.Wiertz E.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L.

Chem. 1998; 273: 9734-9743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) prior to degradation. From the sequence of events outlined above, it is clear that a close relationship must exist between folding and assembly on the one hand and targeting for degradation on the other. It has been suggested that one mechanism whereby proteins can be targeted for degradation is by regulating the trimming of N-linked oligosaccharide chains (17.Jakob C.A. Burda P. Roth J. Aebi M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 18.Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5861-5867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Prior to folding, most glycoproteins interact with either calnexin, calreticulin, or both; the interaction with these proteins is regulated by the glucosylation state of the oligosaccharide side chain (19.Helenius A. Trombetta E.S. Hebert D.N. Simons J.F. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 193-200Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). If the glycoprotein is released from calnexin prior to correct folding, the Man9GlcNAC2 side chain can be reglucosylated by UDP-glucose-glycoprotein glycosyltransferase, thereby initiating another round of binding to calnexin. This binding to calnexin retains glycoproteins within the ER until they fold correctly or assemble with other subunits to form multi-subunit complexes. The oligosaccharide side chain can also be modified within the ER by the action of mannosidase I that removes terminal mannose residues. Interestingly, inhibition of the mannose trimming either by expression in ER mannosidase-deficient yeast strains (17.Jakob C.A. Burda P. Roth J. Aebi M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) or by incubation of mammalian cells in the presence of deoxymannojirimycin (12.Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N.

These results have lead to the hypothesis that mannose trimming provides a timing mechanism allowing the lifetime of a protein within the ER to be regulated. To investigate the molecular interactions occurring during the process of ERAD, we have developed a cell-free system to study the degradation of MHC Class I heavy chain. Cell-free systems have been used in the past to demonstrate that the degradation process is proteasome-mediated, requires ATP, can involve ubiquitination of the substrate, and occurs after dislocation through the Sec61 complex (10.Werner E.D.

Rabbit reticulocyte lysate for degradation assays was prepared as described previously, was not treated with micrococcal nuclease, and did not contain added hemin (25.Pelham H.R.B. Jackson R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 67: 247-256Crossref Scopus (2434) Google Scholar). EASYTAG® [35S]methionine was from NEN Life Science Products. All tissue-culture reagents were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Cycloheximide, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, ALLN, Me2SO, phosphocreatine, and Triton X-100 were purchased from Sigma.

The CEM cell line was from the European Collection of Animal Cell Cultures, and CEM-NKR cells were a gift from Dr. Peter Cresswell (Yale University, New Haven, CT). The S112AΔB27 plasmid was prepared by site-directed mutagenesis by changing serine at position 112 amino acids of the B27 allele of MHC Class I heavy chain to alanine using the S112A forward primer CGCTACTACACAACCAGGCCGAGGCCGGGTCT and reverse primer AGACCCGGCCTCGGCCTGGTTGTAGTAGCG. All plasmids (wild type B27 and S112AΔB27) were linearized at theBamHI restriction site after the stop codon of the DNA coding sequence. In vitro transcription was carried out with T7 RNA polymerase as described previously (23.John D.C.A. Grant M.E. Bulleid N.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 1587-1595Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Translations were carried out in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Flexi-lysate®, Promega) for 60 min at 30 °C. Flexi-lysate does not contain added DTT and, therefore, supports the formation of disulfide bonds in newly synthesized polypeptides (26.Wilson R. Allen A.J. Oliver J. Brookman J.L. High S. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A standard translation mixture consisted of 16.5 μl of reticulocyte lysate, 0.5 μl of amino acids minus methionine, 0.5 μl of KCl (2.5M), 1 μl of transcribed RNA, 1 μl of [35S]methionine (10 μCi/μl), and 5.5 μl of KHM buffer (100 mm KOAc, 2 mm MgOAc, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) or semipermeabilized (SP) cells (∼5 × 105) prepared as described previously (26.Wilson R. Allen A.J. Oliver J. Brookman J.L. High S. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Where appropriate, SP cells were pretreated prior to translation with either 1 mm castanospermine or 1 mm1-deoxymannorijimycin for 10 min at 30 °C. Translation products were incubated with proteinase K (200 μg/ml) on ice for 25 min. Proteinase K was then inhibited with 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride on ice for 5 min. Samples were prepared for SDS-PAGE by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 1% (w/v) SDS, 10% (v/v) glycerol, bromphenol blue) containing DTT (50 mm). Translation of heavy chain mRNA was carried out in the presence of SP cells for 60 min as described above. For these experiments, the total volume of translation mixture was 250 μl, i.e. 10 times the standard mixture. Further protein synthesis was then inhibited by the addition of cycloheximide to 5 mm. The SP cells were isolated by centrifugation for 2 min at 12,000 × g and resuspended in 1 ml of KHM. The resuspended SP cells were divided into aliquots of 140 μl and reisolated by centrifugation for 2 min at 12,000 ×g. Isolated SP cells were resuspended in either 10 μl of KHM or 5 μl of untreated reticulocyte lysate and 5 μl of energy regeneration system (0.5 mm ATP, 10 mmphosphocreatine, 1.6 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase, 40 mmTris-HCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT). Degradation of heavy chain was carried out at 37 °C for various times up to 4 h. For proteasome inhibition studies, untreated reticulocyte lysate or SP cells were pretreated for 15 min with either MG132 (25 μm), ALLN (25 μm), or clasta-lactacystin β-lactone (300 μm). SP cells and untreated reticulocyte lysate were depleted of endogenous source of ATP by pretreatment with 0.1 units/ml hexokinase (1.5 units/ml stock), 0.22 m glucose, and 6.5 mm MgCl2 for 15 min at room temperature. For the stabilization of BiP-heavy chain complexes, SP cells were incubated as above with hexokinase, glucose and MgCl2 and dissociated with the addition of excess ATP at 1 mm for 15 min at room temperature. SP cells were solubilized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100) and subjected to immunoprecipitation. SP cells isolated from translation reactions were solubilized in 500 μl of lysis buffer. Protein A-Sepharose (50 μl) (10% v/v) was added, and samples were incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. Samples were centrifuged for 15 s, and supernatant was transferred to a fresh 1.5-ml tube. Antibodies were then added (1 μl of PDI, ERp57, calreticulin, and β2 microglobulin; 2 μl of calnexin, TAP1, TAP2, W6/32, and BiP; and 10 μl of HC10) along with protein A-Sepharose (50 μl), and samples were incubated for 16 h. Samples were centrifuged for 15 s to pellet protein A-Sepharose, and supernatant was discarded. Pellets were washed three times with lysis buffer, and pellets were resuspended in 30 μl of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing DTT (50 mm) prior to analysis by electrophoresis. Individual aliquots (10 μl) of SP cells in untreated reticulocyte lysate from the degradation assay were layered on top of 300 μl of sucrose cushion (50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 100 mm KCl, and 0.5 m sucrose) and centrifuged at 150,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min in Beckman ultracentrifuge (TLA100.1 rotor) to yield a supernatant and pellet. The proteins were precipitated from the supernatants by the addition of 10% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and 10% (v/v) acetone and placing on ice for 10 min. Insoluble proteins were isolated by centrifugation at 14,000 × g at room temperature for 10 min, washed with 0.5 ml of ice-cold 100% acetone for 5 min, air-dried, and resuspended in SDS sample buffer containing DTT (50 mm). The pellets containing SP cells were resuspended directly in SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing DTT (50 mm). All sucrose solutions were prepared in gradient buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Triton, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Equal volumes of 25 and 5% (w/v) sucrose were differentially mixed using a gradient maker to create a 10-ml 5–25% gradient that was gradually layered onto 0.5 ml of 50% (w/v) sucrose in a Beckman SW-40 tube. Following translation, SP cells were isolated and lysed for 30 min in 0.5 ml of gradient buffer. The lysate was centrifuged at 12000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was slowly layered onto a 9.5-ml 5–25% sucrose gradient. Proteins were separated through the gradient by centrifugation at 40,000 × g (Beckmann SW-40 rotor) for 18 h at 4 °C. We have previously demonstrated that when MHC Class I heavy chain was translated in the presence of SP cells derived from the human cell line HT1080, a heavy chain/β2 microglobulin heterodimer could be formed, as judged by immunoprecipitation with the conformational specific antibody W6/32 (26.Wilson R. Allen A.J. Oliver J. Brookman J.L. High S. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). This assembly was inefficient, probably due to a limited amount of β2-microglobulin or peptide in this cell line. To improve efficiency of assembly, we used here the human cell line CEM, which is lymphoblastoid in origin and has been used previously to study MHC Class I assembly (27.Sadasivan B.K. Cariappa A. Waneck G.L. Cresswell P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). For these studies we have used the B27 allele of human MHC Class I heavy chain. When B27 RNA was translated in the presence of CEM cells, the polypeptide chain wasN-glycosylated, as judged by a decrease in electrophoretic mobility compared with the product of translation in the absence of added cells (Fig. 1 A, lanes 1and 2). The translation product was also translocated across and integrated into the membrane of the ER, as judged by protection from proteolysis with proteinase K (Fig. 1 A, lane 3). The increase in electrophoretic mobility when compared with the product of translation prior to protease digestion is due to the removal of the cytoplasmic tail. The product of translation was completely degraded when the cells were solubilized with Triton X-100 prior to digestion, demonstrating that the translation product was not intrinsically resistant to proteolysis (Fig. 1 A, lane 4). It is worth noting that the reticulocyte lysate used during translation does not contain any added DTT and therefore supports the formation of disulfide bonds as demonstrated previously (26.Wilson R. Allen A.J. Oliver J. Brookman J.L. High S. Bulleid N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 679-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). That the heavy chain had folded correctly and formed a dimer with β2-microglobulin was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitating the translation product with antibodies to this protein (Fig. 1 A, lane 6). This precipitation was specific, as no translation product was immunoprecipitated with preimmune serum (Fig. 1 A, lane 8). Assembly into a complex could also be demonstrated by immunoprecipitation with the conformational specific antibody W6/32 (28.Barnstable C.J. Bodmer W.F. Brown G. Galfre G. Milstein C. Williams A.F. Ziegler A. Cell. 1978; 14: 9-20Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1596) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A, lane 7). Immunoprecipitation of heavy chain with the monoclonal antibody HC10 (which recognizes unassembled chains) (29.Stam N.J. Spits H. Ploegh H.L. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 2299-2306PubMed Google Scholar) shows that the newly synthesized heavy chain is in excess (Fig. 1 A, lane 5), the yield of complex thereby being limited by the availability of free β2 microglobulin. The rabbit reticulocyte lysate used for the translation of heavy chain contains added hemin, a reagent that has been shown previously to inhibit proteasomal activity (30.Haas A.L. Rose I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 6845-6848Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Therefore, to be able to study ERAD, we first isolated cells from the translation mixture after inhibiting further protein synthesis by the addition of cycloheximide. The SP cells were resuspended either in buffer alone or in the presence of an untreated reticulocyte lysate that did not contain added hemin (25.Pelham H.R.B. Jackson R.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 67: 247-256Crossref Scopus (2434) Google Scholar). When the SP cells were resuspended in the presence of this lysate, an ATP regeneration system, and DTT, a time-dependent decrease in the translated heavy chain was observed (Fig. 1 B, lanes 1–6). When the SP cells were resuspended in buffer alone, no such decrease occurred (Fig. 1 B, lane 7). It is important to note that no immunoprecipitation of translation products was carried out, so this observed decrease is due to degradation of the translation product. The degradation of heavy chain in the presence of untreated reticulocyte lysate was shown to be ATP-dependent (Fig. 1 B). However, endogenous ATP bound to ER chaperones such as BiP could be released during the degradation time course. This would account for the small reduction in heavy chain (approximately 20%) observed during the time course. Degradation of heavy chain in the presence of untreated reticulocyte lysate was accelerated by the addition of DTT. DTT is a reducing agent that will break the intrachain disulfide bonds within the translated heavy chain, thereby accelerating unfolding. Hence, the effect of DTT on the degradation process is likely to be due to the unfolding of unassembled heavy chain and disassembly of MHC Class I molecules formed during translation. When heavy chain is translated in the absence of cells, it will not fold correctly, and when this translation product was added to the degradation assay, a more rapid process of degradation was observed (Fig. 1 B, bottom panel). This more rapid degradation could be due to either the heavy chain being unfolded or the fact that there was no requirement for transport from the ER. These results demonstrate that the translated glycosylated heavy chain can be degraded posttranslationally from SP cells by a process that is dependent on an added cytosolic fraction (in this case, an untreated reticulocyte lysate) and ATP and can be accelerated by agents that induce the unfolding of this protein. In all subsequent degradation assays, DTT was included to ensure unfolding of the heavy chain. To evaluate whether the degradation process that we were observing in our SP cells was mediated by the proteasome, we determined the ability of ALLN, MG132 and clasto-lactacystin β-lactone (lactacystin) to inhibit this process. ALLN and MG132 are nonspecific inhibitors of the proteasome, whereas lactacystin is specific, modifying an essential threonine residue within the catalytic core (31.Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). The three inhibitors blocked the degradation of heavy chain from SP cells when they were incubated in the presence of untreated reticulocyte lysate, ATP, and DTT (Fig. 2 A, lanes 1–4). Lactacystin was found to inhibit degradation by approximately 90% when included at a concentration of 30 μm (results not shown). No degradation was observed when SP cells were incubated in the presence of a reticulocyte lysate containing added hemin (results not shown), further indicating that the degradation was proteasome-mediated. To determine whether the proteasome activity was present in the SP cells or the added reticulocyte lysate, we preincubated either the SP cells or reticulocyte lysate with lactacystin, which irreversibly inhibits the proteasome (31.Fenteany G. Standaert R.F. Lane W.S. Choi S. Corey E.J. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1995; 268: 726-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of SP cells did not prevent degradation, whereas pretreatment of reticulocyte lysate inhibited degradation (Fig.2 B). This further verifies that the proteolytic activity is present in the added reticulocyte lysate and is mediated by the proteasome. Previous studies into the mechanism of degradation of heavy chain in the presence of the CMV protein US2 or US11 has demonstrated that in the presence of proteasome inhibitors, heavy chain can be dislocated into the cytosol, where it appears as a soluble, deglycosylated protein (7.Wiertz E.J. Jones T.R. Sun L. Bogyo M. Geuze H.J. Ploegh H.L. Cell. 1996; 84: 769-779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar, 8.Wiertz E.J. Tortorella D. Bogyo M., Yu, J. Mothes W. Jones T.R. Rapoport T.A. Ploegh H.L. Nature. 1996; 384: 432-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). We investigated whether heavy chain could be dislocated in the presence of proteasome inhibitors within our SP cell system. We isolated SP cells after a 4-h incubation in the presence of the untreated reticulocyte lysate and determined whether the heavy chain remained within the membranes of the SP cells or was released. Under these conditions, we detected no soluble heavy chain released from the SP cells (Fig.3 A). This does not exclude the possibility that heavy chain was dislocated but remained associated with the outside of the ER membrane of the SP cells during the course of this experiment. To test this, we carried out a proteinase K digest to determine whether the heavy chain was still sequestered in the ER membrane. The results (Fig. 3 B) clearly demonstrate that the heavy chain present within the membranes is protected from proteolysis. Furthermore, the cytosolic tail remains sensitive to degradation by proteinase K, demonstrating that the protein is still integrated in the membrane and that the cytosolic tail is still intact. Hence, in the absence of proteasome activity, the degradation of heavy chain is inhibited, and the dislocation from the ER membrane is also prevented. This suggests that at least in non-virally infected cells, the dislocation of MHC Class I heavy chain is coupled to degradation. When MHC Class I heavy chain is expressed in cell lines deficient in calnexin, assembly can still occur, and a fully assembled complex can be expressed at the cell surface (27.Sadasivan B.K. Cariappa A. Waneck G.L. Cresswell P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 267-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Similarly, when heavy chain is expressed in insect cells in the presence of β2 microglobulin, assembly occurs; however, co-expression of calnexin prevents heavy chain degradation and thereby increases the yield of MHC Class I molecules (32.Vassilakos A. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Williams D.B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Calnexin, therefore, is not an absolute requirement for assembly but may be required to prevent the premature degradation of heavy chain. To investigate the role of calnexin in ERAD, we translated heavy chain in SP cells de"

The calculations utilize the empirical valence bond method in combination with the molecular dynamics free energy perturbation technique and path integral simulations. For the enzyme-catalyzed reaction a H/D kinetic isotope effect of 5.0 ± 1.3 is predicted in reasonable agreement with the experimental result of about 3. Furthermore, the magnitude of quantum mechanical effects is found to be very similar for the enzyme reaction and the corresponding uncatalyzed process in solution, in agreement with other studies.

The problems associated with attaining the required accuracy in order for the present approach to be useful as a diagnostic tool for the study of enzyme reactions are also discussed. glyoxalase I glutathione empirical valence bond kinetic isotope effect molecular dynamics Monte Carlo Glyoxalase I (GlxI)1 is the first enzyme of the glyoxalase system, which catalyzes the transformation of toxic 2-oxoaldehydes, such as methylglyoxal, into the corresponding nontoxic α-hydroxycarboxylic acid. A glutathione (GSH) molecule and a divalent metal ion are required as cofactors in GlxI. Upon binding, methylglyoxal and GSH spontaneously form a hemithioacetal, which is the actual substrate of GlxI. In the reaction, this hemithioacetal is converted to S-d-lactoylglutathione. Subsequently, glyoxalase II hydrolyzes S-d-lactoylglutathione intod-lactic acid and GSH (Fig.1) (1Vander Jagt D.L. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramovic O. Coenzymes and Cofactors. 3A. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989: 597-641Google Scholar). The reaction mechanism catalyzed by GlxI has been proposed to proceed via an unstable enediol(-ate) intermediate formed through proton abstraction from the C1 carbon of the substrate by an amino acid residue acting as a base (2Ridderström M. Cameron A.D. Jones T.A. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21623-21628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). This type of mechanism is analogous to that of several other enzymes catalyzing reactions of carbon acids, such as triose-phosphate isomerase (3Knowles J.R. Albery W.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 1977; 10: 105-111Crossref Scopus (330) Google Scholar), enolase (4Anderson S.R. Anderson V.E. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10545-10555Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and mandelate racemase (5Kallarakal A. Mitra B. Kozarich J.W. Gerlt J. Clifton J.G. Petsko G.A. Kenyon G.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2788-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). It is thus of interest to elucidate possible common features and principles of enzyme catalysis for this class of reactions. In GlxI a primary deuterium kinetic isotope effect of about 3 with methylglyoxal and phenylglyoxal substrates has been interpreted such that this proton transfer is the rate-limiting step (1Vander Jagt D.L. Dolphin D. Poulson R. Avramovic O. Coenzymes and Cofactors. 3A. John Wiley & Sons, New York1989: 597-641Google Scholar). The recently solved crystal structure of GlxI in complex with the transition state analogueS-(N-hydroxy-N-p-iodophenylcarbamoyl)glutathione (6Cameron A.D. Ridderström M. Olin B. Kavarana M.J. Creighton D.J. Mannervik B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13480-13490Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) shows a homodimer with two identical active sites in which a Zn2+ ion is coordinated by two glutamate residues (Glu172 and Glu99), a histidine (His26), a glutamine (Gln33), and the two carbamoyl oxygens of S-(N-hydroxy-N-p-iodophenylcarbamoyl)glutathione. This structure implies that the enediolate intermediate is in cis configuration with both its oxygens pointing toward the metal. Based on structural analysis and site-directed mutagenesis studies, it seems that Glu172 is the proton-abstracting base for the reaction with the S-form of the substrate (2Ridderström M. Cameron A.D. Jones T.A. Mannervik B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21623-21628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar,6Cameron A.D. Ridderström M. Olin B. Kavarana M.J. Creighton D.J. Mannervik B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13480-13490Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Recent empirical valence bond (EVB) simulation studies by us on the presumed rate-limiting step of the GlxI reaction with the Senantiomer of the methylglyoxal GSH hemithioacetal substrate and Glu172 as the proton-abstracting base gave an activation free energy in good agreement with kinetic data (7Feierberg I. Cameron A.D. Åqvist J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The calculations showed, also in agreement with experiments, that the enzyme is not extremely sensitive to the divalent metal ion species bound to the active site. It was found that Mg2+, Zn2+, and Ca2+ are able to promote catalysis, although the latter ion yields a ∼1 kcal/mol higher activation barrier than the two former. Furthermore, these simulations clearly showed that the active site metal ion is the key catalytic factor in GlxI and that it provides the main part of the essential stabilization of the enediolate intermediate (7Feierberg I. Cameron A.D. Åqvist J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Because H/D/T kinetic isotope effect (KIE) measurements are one of the major experimental probes of reaction mechanisms involving hydrogen transfer (8Albery W.J. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5588-5600Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), it would be very helpful to have reliable theoretical methods for predicting such KIEs in enzyme reactions. Whereas ab initio methods are useful for calculation of KIEs in the gas phase, solution and enzyme-catalyzed reactions present major challenges in this respect. However, significant progress in theoretical modeling of enzyme isotope effects in a realistic environment have been made in recent years, in particular using so-called path integral calculations (9Hwang J.-K. Chu Z.T. Yadav A. Warshel A. J. Phys. Chem. 1991; 91: 8445-8448Crossref Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 10Hwang J.-K. Warshel A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 11745-11751Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar) as well as with semiclassical methods combined with variational transition state theory including tunneling corrections (11Alhambra C. Gao J. Corchado J.C Villà J. Truhlar D.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 2253-2258Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar). In this work, we employ a version of the path integral simulation technique (10Hwang J.-K. Warshel A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 11745-11751Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 12Voth G.A.

We also examine the influence of quantum mechanical effects (zero-point energies and tunneling) on the rate acceleration relative to the corresponding uncatalyzed process in water.

The reaction in this case is represented by the two valence bond resonance structures (Φ1 and Φ2) shown in Fig. 2, whose energies are given by the corresponding diagonal elements of the EVB Hamiltonian.Hii=ɛi=V(i)bond+V(i)angle+V(i)torsionEquation 1 +V(i)nonbond+V(i)rs+Vss+α(i) Here the first three terms denote intramolecular potential energies (Morse bond potentials, angles, dihedral, and improper torsion potentials), and the fourth term describes the nonbonded electrostatic and van der Waals interactions between the reacting fragments. Vrs(i) represents the interactions between the reacting groups and their surroundings (enzyme and water), whereas Vss is the potential energy of the surrounding protein-solvent system. The last term is the intrinsic gas phase energy of valence bond state i with the fragments at infinite separation. The gas phase free energy difference Δα = α(2) − α(1) as well as the off-diagonal Hamiltonian elements H 12 describing the mixing of the pure valence bond states were calibrated as described in Ref. 7Feierberg I.

FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar to reproduce the experimental reaction free energy and activation barrier of the corresponding uncatalyzed reaction in solution. The reaction free energy was calculated from the difference in pKa between Glu (4.1) and the substrate (13.5) (7Feierberg I. Cameron A.D. Åqvist J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and the activation free energy was obtained from the linear free energy relationship in Fig. 3 of Ref. 16Åqvist J. Fothergill M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10010-10016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar. This yielded reaction and activation free energies of ΔGwat0 = 12.8 kcal/mol and ΔG‡wat = 22.1 kcal/mol, respectively. The effects of quantum mechanical nuclear motion were examined by treating the substrate C1 atom, the transferring hydrogen, and the acceptor oxygen as quantized particles employing the centroid path integral technique (10Hwang J.-K. Warshel A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 11745-11751Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 12Voth G.A. Chandler D. Miller W.H. J. Chem. Phys. 1989; 91: 7749-7760Crossref Scopus (466) Google Scholar). In this formulation, each quantized particle is represented by a closed ring (or necklace) of quasiparticles, which are sequentially connected by harmonic springs and each experiencing a fraction of the external potential acting on the real particle. The effective quantum mechanical potential of such a quantized particle is given by,Vq=mP2(kT)2h2∑J=1P(xj−xj+1)2+1P∑j=1PVcl(xj)Equation 2 where P is the number of quasiparticles (with coordinates xj) in the necklace, m is the mass of the real atom, and Vcl is the classical potential on the atom. For the interaction between the quantized atoms, quasiparticle j in one necklace interacts with the corresponding j:th bead in the other. As one can see from Equation 2, the dispersion of the quantized atom depends on its mass and the temperature such that it approaches the classical limit as these quantities increase. Although path integral simulations can be carried out by direct MD on all (quantum and classical) particles, such calculations will suffer from convergence problems, at least as far as small energy differences between different isotopes are concerned, because of the regular noise and divergence of trajectories. However, the fact that the motion of the center of mass (centroid, denoted by x̄) of the quantized particle can be rigorously separated from the fluctuations of the quasiparticles around the centroid allows much more efficient computations (10Hwang J.-K. Warshel A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 11745-11751Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The two types of trajectories can thus be generated independently. Here we use a standard Monte Carlo (MC) procedure to generate configurations of the different (free particle) quantized necklaces, which are then used together with MD simulations of the full classical system including the corresponding centroids (which are then treated as regular classical particles). By this computational scheme, the usual perturbation formula for calculating reaction free energy profiles (7Feierberg I. Cameron A.D. Åqvist J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 14Warshel A. Computer Modeling of Chemical Reactions in Enzymes and Solutions.

Warshel A. Chem. Rev. 1993; 93: 2523-2544Crossref Scopus (760) Google Scholarfor details), and the sum runs over all quasiparticles in each necklace. The two types of averages involved are thus taken over the free particle necklace distributions (fp) and over the classical MD trajectories on the mapping potential (Vm). All simulations of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction used the crystal structure of GlxI in complex with S-(N-hydroxy-N-p-iodophenylcarbamoyl)glutathione (6Cameron A.D. Ridderström M. Olin B. Kavarana M.J. Creighton D.J. Mannervik B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 13480-13490Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) as the starting point, where the ligand coordinates were used to dock the S-hemithioacetal of glutathione and methylglyoxal. The active site Zn2+ ion was replaced by Mg2+, because the two ions give essentially the same catalytic effect (7Feierberg I. Cameron A.D. Åqvist J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and the latter is simpler to treat computationally. For the uncatalyzed reaction, the starting coordinates of the reacting groups were directly taken from the above crystal structure. The reaction center was surrounded by an 18 Å sphere of SPC water (17van Gunsteren W.F. Berendsen H.J.C. Groningen Molecular Simulation (GROMOS) Library Manual. Biomos B. V., Nijenborgh, Groningen, The Netherlands1987Google Scholar) in these simulations and by a sphere of the same size, containing both protein and water, in the enzyme simulations. The protein atoms outside this sphere were restrained to their x-ray coordinates and interacted only via bonds across the boundary. A nonbonded cutoff of 10 Å was used together with multipole expansion for long range electrostatics (18Lee F.S. Warshel A. J. Chem. Phys. 1992; 97: 3100-3107Crossref Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The water surface was subjected to radial and polarization restraints as described elsewhere (19King G. Warshel A. J. Chem. Phys. 1989; 91: 3647-3661Crossref Scopus (413) Google Scholar, 20Marelius J. Kolmodin K. Feierberg I. Åqvist J. J. Mol. Graph. Mod. 1999; 16: 213-225Crossref Google Scholar). Net charges were assigned to Arg37, Glu99, Lys150, and Glu172 because these amino acid residues are close to the reaction center, whereas distant ionizable groups were treated as neutral. The simulations were initiated from structures which had been equilibrated for 50 ps. All perturbations were carried out using 51 discrete free energy perturbation steps (λs). An MD timestep of 1 fs and a constant temperature of 300 K was used in all calculations. Equilibrium bond lengths and dissociation energies for the reacting groups were taken from standard Morse potentials and AM1 calculations (7Feierberg I. Cameron A.D. Åqvist J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The GROMOS87 force field was otherwise used in the calculations (17van Gunsteren W.F. Berendsen H.J.C. Groningen Molecular Simulation (GROMOS) Library Manual. Biomos B. V., Nijenborgh, Groningen, The Netherlands1987Google Scholar) together with the ion parameters in Refs. 21Åqvist J. J. Phys.

The EVB Hamiltonian (Δα and Hij) was parameterized against available data on the activation barrier and reaction free energy for the uncatalyzed reference reaction in solution as described in Ref. 7Feierberg I. Cameron A.D. Åqvist J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar. In the path integral simulations each quantized particle was represented by 20 quasiparticles and 6 × 106 MC configurations (after equilibration) were generated for the quantized 1H,2H, 3H, 16O, and 12C necklaces at 300 K. All MD simulations and free energy calculations were carried out using the program Q (20Marelius J. Kolmodin K. Feierberg I. Åqvist J. J. Mol. Graph. Mod. 1999; 16: 213-225Crossref Google Scholar). Three sets of simulations with different ratios between classical and quantized particle sampling were performed for the reaction with each hydrogen isotope in the enzyme and in water. The first set of simulations had a classical trajectory length (excluding equilibration) of 255 ps with 5 MC configurations/classical step. The second also used 255 ps MD trajectories, but with only 1 MC configuration/step. The third set used 127.5 ps of classical MD with 10 MC configurations/step. Energy data were collected every 5 fs in all cases. Because of the separate calculations of classical trajectories and the necklace configurations, each such trajectory could be combined with different isotope quasiparticle distributions so that isotope effects were evaluated on the same classical trajectory. Likewise, the same MD trajectory could be used with and without considering quantized atoms to examine the magnitude of the quantum effects. As an additional check the enzyme calculations were repeated with an extended set of six quantized atoms (forming angles involving the transferring hydrogen), which yielded virtually identical results. One of the main advantages with the EVB method is the possibility to calibrate the reaction free energy surface against experimental data for relevant reference reactions in solution. Because observed rate and equilibrium constants for a given solution reaction include the effects of quantum mechanical zero-point energy and tunneling as well as barrier recrossings, these effects are implicitly taken into account by the standard EVB approach. When calculating enzyme reaction free energy profiles on the basis of such aqueous solution calibrations, it is assumed that the magnitude of these quantum and dynamical effects is similar in the catalyzed and the uncatalyzed reactions. That is, if these “corrections” to the classical transition state theory are similar in the two environments then it is reasonable to expect that classical MD calculations for the enzyme and solution reactions will capture most of the catalytic effect. That the above assumption is, in fact, a very good approximation is immediately evident from Fig. 3, which shows the results from classical and path integral simulations of the GlxI reaction in the enzyme and in solution. The free energy profiles denoted by diamonds in Fig. 3 were obtained from classical trajectories where the solution profile has been calculated as described in Ref. 7Feierberg I. Cameron A.D. Åqvist J. FEBS Lett. 1999; 453: 90-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar against experimental data. If instead the quantized path integral trajectories are used, again with parameterization of the water profile against experiment, we obtain the free energy curves denoted by circles in Fig. 3. The fact that the two different enzyme profiles, obtained with and without explicit simulation of quantum mechanical nuclear motion, essentially coincide demonstrates that the quantized motions contribute very little to the catalytic effect. The actual difference in activation free energy between the classical and quantum treatments for this reaction step is only 0.2 ± 0.3 kcal/mol. The free energy profiles denoted by triangles in Fig. 3 are evaluated from the classical trajectories but using the calibration from the quantized path integral simulations of the solution reaction. The deviations of these classical profiles from the quantum ones (illustrated by vertical arrows in Fig. 3) therefore directly depict the magnitudes of quantum effects in the two microenvironments. Hence, it is clear that zero-point energy and tunneling effects contribute significantly to the rate of proton transfer, (ΔΔG‡qu ∼2.5 kcal/mol), but because the contributions are almost identical in the enzyme and water reactions the overall contribution to the catalytic effect is negligible. The same conclusion was reached in a recent study of proton transfer of carbonic anhydrase, although an error range of 2 kcal/mol was reported there (10Hwang J.-K. Warshel A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 11745-11751Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Our present error bar for the difference in ΔΔG‡qu between enzyme and water is only 0.2 kcal/mol, so we consider this conclusion strongly supported by the present data. Fig. 4 shows a snapshot from the simulations with 1H in the transition state region, where the arrangement of the catalytically important residues can be seen. In addition, the essence of the path integral treatment can be appreciated from the spatial dispersion of the quantized particles. The fact that the present EVB model, both without explicit treatment of quantum effects and combined with path integral simulations, yields an activation barrier for the first reaction step in GlxI that agrees well with kinetic data (23Ridderström M. Cameron A.D. Jones T.A. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), makes it particularly interesting to examine the performance of the latter approach for predicting KIEs. Fig.5 shows the results of path integral simulations of H/D/T abstraction from the hemithioacetal substrate by Glu172 in GlxI and by glutamate in aqueous solution. The free energy profiles in Fig. 5 are given relative to the same free energy perturbation mapping (or reference) potential so that the combined quantum mechanical effects because of zero-point energy and tunneling along the reaction path can be appreciated. The calculated average KIEs in the enzyme and in water from three different simulations are given in Table I. We obtain here a H/D KIE of 5.0 ± 1.3 for the enzyme reaction which is in reasonable agreement with the experimental value of about 3, considering the small free energy differences involved (see below). The corresponding calculated H/D KIE for the uncatalyzed reaction in water is 3.6 ± 0.7. The calculated H/T and D/T KIEs are also given in Table I but no experimental values for these have been reported so far. Of course, because we are dealing with very small activation free energy differences between the isotopes, i.e. a KIE of 3 corresponds to a ΔΔG‡ of only 0.6 kcal/mol at room temperature, it is essential to gauge the accuracy of these results. Thus, we carried out several independent simulations with different classical centroid trajectories and different MC samples of the necklace quasiparticle distributions. Analysis of these MD/MC runs shows that the present convergence error range for the KIE is only about 0.2 kcal/mol. To reach this level of accuracy, however, it seems necessary to use fairly long MD trajectories, which together with the MC treatment of the quasiparticles make the calculations rather time consuming but not intractable. Even with relatively long MD trajectories on the order of several hundred ps it is well known that the absolute activation free energies are associated with larger errors, typically ∼1 kcal/mol. Here, it is the separability of the classical (centroid) and quantized (necklace) motions (10Hwang J.-K. Warshel A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 11745-11751Crossref Scopus (193) Google Scholar) that allow a significantly higher accuracy to be attained for the relative activation free energies between different isotopes. That is, each KIE calculation can be carried out using the same centroid trajectory for H, D, and T, and it appears that the KIEs do not depend strongly on the classical trajectories. On the other hand, as noted above, different classical trajectories yield slightly different absolute free energy profiles with convergence errors in ΔG‡ of about 1 kcal/mol.Table ICalculated primary kinetic isotope effects for the proton transfer reaction in Glxl, in aqueous solution and in the gas phaseKIE(H/D)KIE(H/T)KIE(D/T)Enzyme5.0 ± 1.38.4 ± 2.81.6 ± 0.2Water3.6 ± 0.76.4 ± 1.41.8 ± 0.2Gas phase 6–31+G*4.99.52.0Gas phase AM15.511.62.1 Open table in a new tab For comparison with the above calculations of KIEs in GlxI and in water, it is of interest to examine the intrinsic KIEs originating from zero-point energies of the corresponding gas phase reaction. We thus calculated the ground and transition state structures for the elementary proton transfer step of a model system where Glu172 was replaced by acetate and the substrate truncated so that the -S-CH2- linker was replaced by S-CH3 (cf. Fig. 2) using AM1 and ab initio 6–31+G* calculations (24Frisch M.J. et al.Gaussian 94 , Revision B.2, Gaussian, Inc., Pittsburgh PA1995Google Scholar). With a standard scaling of Hartree-Fock frequencies by 0.89 (to compensate for the neglect of electron correlation) and only considering the zero-point energy contributions we obtained KIEs of 4.9, 9.5, and 2.0 for H/D, H/T, and D/T, respectively (the calculated bare energy barrier is 27.8 kcal/mol). As a comparison, the unscaled AM1 frequencies give KIEs of 5.5, 11.6, and 2.1 (Table I). The calculated values of the isotope effects are thus rather similar in the three environments (gas phase, water, and enzyme), although there is some indication of larger H/D and H/T effects in the enzyme and gas phase compared with solution. The geometrical arrangement of the donor hydrogen acceptor atoms of the EVB and quantum mechanical gas phase transition states are also quite similar. The rate of hydrogen tunneling in enzyme reactions has attracted considerable attention in recent years, largely because of the experimental efforts of Klinman and co-workers (25Kohen A. Klinman J.P. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 397-404Crossref Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 26Kohen A. Cannio R. Bartolucci S. Klinman J.P. Nature. 1999; 399: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). In the semiclassical picture, where KIEs only originate from the differences in zero-point energy, the ratio between the H/D and D/T isotope effects are simply predicted from the masses of the isotopes and one obtains ln(H/T)/ln(D/T) = 3.3 (27Saunders Jr., W.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1985; 107: 164-169Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Measurements of the ratios of these isotope effects in enzymes have therefore been used as a probe of hydrogen tunneling (25Kohen A. Klinman J.P. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 397-404Crossref Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 26Kohen A. Cannio R. Bartolucci S. Klinman J.P. Nature. 1999; 399: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar). In particular, if the ratio ln(H/T)/ln(D/T) is significantly larger than 3.3 this would indicate that transfer of the lighter proton has a substantial contribution from tunneling. Another useful probe of tunneling effects is the temperature dependence of KIEs (25Kohen A. Klinman J.P. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 397-404Crossref Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 26Kohen A. Cannio R. Bartolucci S. Klinman J.P. Nature. 1999; 399: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 28Guthrie J.P. Kluger R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 11569-11572Crossref Scopus (154) Google Scholar). As far as the ratio ln(H/T)/ln(D/T) is concerned, we obtain here values of 4.8 ± 1.0, 3.2 ± 0.3, and 3.4 for the enzyme, solution, and ab initio gas phase reactions, respectively. Whereas the calculated KIE ratio in the enzyme appears to differ somewhat from the solution and gas phase reactions, where the ratio is close to that predicted semiclassically, the present accuracy is unfortunately not enough to judge the significance of this difference. On the other hand, our comparison above (Fig. 3) of the reaction free energy profiles with and without simulation of quantum effects clearly shows that the overall magnitude of these effects is very similar in the enzyme and solution reactions. A better test case for examining the issue of nuclear tunneling contributions would therefore probably be the alcohol dehydrogenases studied by Klinman and co-workers (25Kohen A. Klinman J.P. Acc. Chem. Res. 1998; 31: 397-404Crossref Scopus (348) Google Scholar, 26Kohen A. Cannio R. Bartolucci S. Klinman J.P. Nature. 1999; 399: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar), where tunneling is said to be significant, and the temperature dependence is unexpected. In summary, we have used a combination of EVB and path integral simulations in this work to examine kinetic H/D/T isotope effects on the initial proton abstraction step in GlxI. This reaction step is believed to be rate-limiting in the enzyme and is associated with an observed H/D KIE of about 3. Our calculated reaction free energy profiles both from classical and path integral simulations agree well with the experimental activation barrier for the proton abstraction step. Furthermore, we find that the contribution of quantum mechanical effects to catalysis are very small, i.e. the magnitude of these effects are essentially the same in the enzyme and in the uncatalyzed solution reaction. Nevertheless, it is important to treat quantum and dynamical effects in a consistent way in computational modeling studies of enzyme reactions. In the standard EVB approach (14Warshel A. Computer Modeling of Chemical Reactions in Enzymes and Solutions. John Wiley & Sons, New York1991Google Scholar, 15Åqvist J. Warshel A. Chem. Rev. 1993; 93: 2523-2544Crossref Scopus (760) Google Scholar) this problem is solved by calibration of the potential surface against experimental data, which implicitly include such effects. Most other so-called quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methods are not parametrized against rate constants so that zero-point energy, nuclear tunneling, and barrier recrossing corrections, in principle, need to be considered explicitly. However, it is important to realize that zero-point energy corrections are dominating and that most semiempirical methods, which are often used in quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations, are parametrized against experimental heats of formation and also implicitly include the zero-point energies. To get direct information regarding the magnitude of the above mentioned corrections to classical transition state theory, it appears that both path integral simulations of the type described herein and the approach of Alhambra et al. (11Alhambra C. Gao J. Corchado J.C Villà J. Truhlar D.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 2253-2258Crossref Scopus (135) Google Scholar) can be very useful. Regarding dynamical effects in enzyme reactions, which can be expressed in terms of a transmission factor in the transition state theory, reactive flux simulations of the type recently reported by Neria and Karplus (29Neria E. Karplus M. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1997; 267: 23-30Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar) can provide useful information. However, so far there is no convincing evidence that dynamical effects are important in enzyme catalysis (14Warshel A. Computer Modeling of Chemical Reactions in Enzymes and Solutions. John Wiley & Sons, New York1991Google Scholar, 29Neria E. Karplus M. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1997; 267: 23-30Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 31Warshel A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27035-27038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar). This should not be interpreted in such a way that the enzyme flexibility and conformational changes are unimportant for their function. But there is no evidence that the actual dynamics, or time dependence of motions, contribute significantly to the catalytic rate enhancement compared with uncatalyzed solution reactions. In other words, it is the regular Boltzmann probability of being at the transition state (that could be calculated by time-independent Monte Carlo simulation as well) that is by far the most important determinant of the rate acceleration and not the detailed nature of the trajectories leading to the transition state. Our calculated value of the H/D KIE for proton abstraction from the hemithioacetal substrate in GlxI is about 5.0 ± 1.3. Within the accuracy of the simulations this value is compatible with the experimentally measured effect of around 3 (23Ridderström M. Cameron A.D. Jones T.A. Mannervik B. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 231-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The corresponding KIE calculated for the uncatalyzed solution reaction is 3.6 ± 0.7, whereas the semiclassical KIE (excluding tunneling) for the gas phase reaction is found to be 4.9 from ab initio calculations. The fact that the KIEs obtained for the different environments and with different methods are rather similar would suggest that this range of H/D KIE is intrinsic to the reaction and not largely affected by the surroundings. In the enzyme reaction it is expected that once the H/D/T has been initially abstracted by the general base it will rapidly be exchanged with solution (30Leadlay P.F. Albery W.J. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1976; 15: 5617-5620Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, it indeed seems reasonable to interpret the observed KIE in terms of the initial proton transfer being rate-limiting. It can be noted that several of the other enzymes mentioned above that catalyze reactions of carbon acids also show H/D KIEs of around 3 (e.g. triosephosphate isomerase (3Knowles J.R. Albery W.J. Acc. Chem. Res. 1977; 10: 105-111Crossref Scopus (330) Google Scholar), yeast enolase (4Anderson S.R. Anderson V.E. Knowles J.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 10545-10555Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and mandelate racemase (5Kallarakal A. Mitra B. Kozarich J.W. Gerlt J. Clifton J.G. Petsko G.A. Kenyon G.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2788-2797Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar)). This may indicate that, despite the differing substrates and details of the catalytic machinery, the transition states for enzyme-catalyzed proton abstraction from carbon acids are rather similar."

Its expression can be tightly regulated;e.g. during hair growth, versican expression is regulated cyclically, correlated to the hair growth cycle itself (14.du Cros D.L. LeBaron R.G. Couchman J.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 426-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Characteristic structural features of this molecular family include a globular domain (G1) at the amino terminus directly following signal peptide, and a globular domain known as the G3 (or the selectin-like) domain at the carboxyl terminus (15.Margolis R.U. Margolis R.K. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 105-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). A large sequence named for its role in chondroitin sulfate (CS) chain attachment is situated between G1 and G3. The G1 and G3 domains are highly conserved (between species and within this proteoglycan family). The G1 domain is composed of one immunoglobulin (IgG)-like motif and two tandem repeats. This domain has the same structure as link protein, which binds hyaluronan (16.LeBaron R.G. Zimmermann D.R. Ruoslahti E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10003-10010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17.Deák F. Kiss I. Sparks K.J. Argraves W.S. Hampikian G. Goetinck P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 3766-3770Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The G3 domain is composed of two alternatively spliced epidermal growth factor (EGF)1-like motif(s), one lectin (also known as carbohydrate recognition domain or CRD)-like motif, one complement-binding protein (CBP)-like motif, and a short carboxyl-terminal tail. Given their ubiquitousness and their high degree of conservation, it is likely that G1 and G3 play vital roles in proteoglycan functions, but the details of these roles are only beginning to be elucidated. In the fatal chicken disorder known as nanomelia, for instance, the core protein of the proteoglycan aggrecan contains a premature stop codon N-terminal to the G3 domain. This truncated aggrecan does not contain any glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains and is poorly secreted, suggesting that the presence of a G3 domain is crucial for proteoglycan processing and function. This study was designed to investigate the roles of G1 and G3 domains in chicken versican/PG-M synthesis and activities. We have generated a number of recombinant constructs to examine these effects. We observed that the presence of the G1 domain inhibits the attachment of glycosaminoglycan chains and secretion of the products, while the G3 domain enhances both processes. Furthermore, on the subdomain level, we demonstrated that the tandem repeats of G1 are in a large part responsible for its inhibition of versican secretion, and it is G3's CBP motif that seems to enhance GAG attachment to versican.

The PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and digested withXhoI and XbaI. The digested products were purified again and used to replace the G3 fragment of the miniversican construct that had been digested with XhoI andXbaI (a cloning site in the vector) to remove the G3 fragment. In the same way, CBP fragment was synthesized with CBPN and G3C as primers and G3 domain as a template in a PCR. The PCR products were digested with XhoI and SphI and purified. The purified products were used to replace the G3 domain of the miniversican construct, which had been digested with XhoI and SphI (a cloning site in the vector). To produce the G1G3 construct, LPN and G1Cc were used as primers and the miniversican as a template in a PCR. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and XhoI and purified. The purified products were inserted into an EcoRI- (a cloning site in the vector) and XhoI-digested miniversican construct, from which the leading peptide, the G1 domain, and CS sequence had been removed byEcoRI and XhoI digestion. In a similar way, LPN and IgGC were used as primers in a PCR using the miniversican as template. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI andXbaI, and the purified products were inserted intoEcoRI- and XbaI-digested pcDNA3 plasmid to obtain the IgG construct. To generate the TR and CBP constructs, TR was synthesized using TRN and G1Cb as primers, while CBP was synthesized using CBPN and G3C as primers. Both products were digested with XhoI andSphI. The leading peptide was synthesized with LPN and LP60b to generate an EcoRI restriction site at the amino terminus and an XhoI site at the carboxyl terminus of the leading peptide. Thus, the leading peptide, one TR fragment, and one CBP fragment were inserted into EcoRI- andSphI-digested pcDNA1 plasmid. To generate the CS construct, CS sequence was synthesized using CSNb and CSC as primers in a PCR. The PCR products were digested withBamHI and XhoI. The leading peptide was synthesized with LPN and LP60a and digested with EcoRI andBamHI. Both fragments were inserted into EcoRI- and XhoI-digested pcDNA3 plasmid. To produce the CRD construct, CRD was synthesized using CRDN and CRDC as primers in a PCR. The PCR products were digested withXhoI and XbaI and purified. The purified products were inserted into an XhoI- and XbaI-digested CBP construct, in which the XhoI site was situated between the leading peptide and the CBP fragment, while the XbaI site was located 3′ of the SphI site. COS-7 cells, astrocytoma cell line U87, or NIH3T3 fibroblasts, cultured in six-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 105 cells/well, were allowed to attach and grow overnight in DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS. The following day, Lipofectin (10 μl) was incubated with plasmid DNA (2 μg) for 15 min in 200 μl of DMEM followed by the addition of 800 μl of DMEM. The Lipofectin-DNA mixture was added to washed cultures, and the cultures were incubated in an incubator at 37 °C. After 5 h, the DNA/Lipofectin mixture was replaced with 2 ml of DMEM supplemented with 5% FBS. The culture medium and cell lysate were harvested separately after 3 days, and samples were frozen at −20 °C until analysis. Cell lysate and growth medium that contained recombinant gene products were harvested from transfected cultures and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was carried out as described previously (18.Zhang Y. Cao L. Yang B.L. Yang B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21342-21352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 19.Zhang Y. Cao L. Yang B.L. Yang B.B. J. Biol.

Densitometer readings were used to estimate relative protein concentration from the intensity of the chemiluminescent signal, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Molecular Dynamics Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Results were reported below each Western blot analyzed. This study is designed to investigate the roles of the G1 domain and the G3 domain in versican biosynthesis and secretion. We have previously observed that the versican signal peptide is not sufficient for secretion of the G1 domain (data not shown). Replacing the native versican signal peptide with the leading peptide of link protein resulted in secretion of G1. For reasons of consistency, we have substituted the link protein leading peptide for the endogenous signal peptide in every construct used in this study (Fig.1). To investigate the role of the G1 domain of versican in product secretion, the CS and G1 constructs (Fig. 1) were expressed in COS-7 cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Growth medium was collected and analyzed on Western blot probed with the monoclonal antibody 4B6, which recognizes an epitope within the leading peptide. G1 and CS products were produced and secreted to the media as expected (Fig. 2 A), except that CS expression was significantly higher than that of G1. Using these constructs, we then compared glycosaminoglycan chain attachment to the CS-bearing sequence of the core protein. COS-7 cells were transfected with G1CS and CS constructs, and the growth medium was analyzed on Western blot. Both constructs produced a characteristic proteoglycan smear after immunoblotting (Fig. 2 B), indicating that the core proteins of the recombinant constructs were modified by GAG chain attachment. However, the CS construct exhibited higher levels of GAG modification than did the G1CS construct. In view of the reduced secretion of the G1 product, we sought to identify specific motif(s) in the G1 domain responsible for inhibition of secretion. We thus generated an IgG construct and a TR construct containing two tandem repeats (Fig. 1) and expressed them in COS-7 cells. Cell lysate and culture medium were harvested and analyzed on Western blot. Both constructs were well expressed, and significant amounts of products were found in the cell lysate (Fig.3). However, while the product of the IgG construct was secreted into the medium at high levels, the product of the TR construct was not observed in the media at all. Prolonged exposure of the Western blot revealed two weak bands in the lane containing the greatest amount of loaded media, suggesting glycosylation of the products. We further investigated the time course of biosynthesis and secretion of TR products. COS-7 cells were transfected with the TR construct and cultured for 2, 3, or 5 days after transfection. Western blot analysis showed that TR products were expressed after only 2 days of transfection, but secretion was weak even 5 days after transfection (Fig.4).Figure 4A time course of TR product secretion.COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with the TR construct and cultures were maintained in DMEM, 5% FBS for different periods as indicated in the figure (2, 3, or 5 days). Cell lysate and culture media were harvested, and 10 or 20 μl was analyzed on Western blot probed with 4B6. Secretion of TR products to the culture media was readily detected after 3 days.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The work done in this laboratory and others has suggested that the G3 domain has important physiological functions (18.Zhang Y.

Biochem. 1994; 228: 299-306Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). This led us to investigate the role of the versican G3 domain in biosynthesis and product secretion. We transfected COS-7 cells with the G1 and G3 constructs. Gene products were analyzed as above. Transfected cells secreted significantly greater amounts of G3 than G1 (Fig. 5 A). Cell lysate obtained from G3-transfected cells also contained a higher level of the G3 product. A similar level of secretion was observed in cells transfected with the CSG3 construct, implying that the G3 domain of the recombinant gene plays an important role in biosynthesis and secretion of proteoglycans. Further confirmation came from comparison of the G1CS and CSG3 constructs. COS-7 cells transfected with CSG3 construct produced significantly higher levels of products, and these products were secreted at greater levels than were G1CS gene products (Fig.5 B). This experiment also showed that the levels of GAG chain modification on the G1CS and CSG3 core proteins were very different. The sizes of the core proteins of G1CS and CSG3 constructs are similar, so the fact that the smear bands in CSG3-transfected cells (Fig. 5 B, medium) were much more intense than in G1CS-transfected cells suggested that there were more GAG chains attached to the CS sequence of CSG3 construct than to G1CS construct and that more products of CSG3 were secreted to the medium than G1CS products. These results suggested again that the G3 domain promoted GAG attachment. In view of the significant but distinct effects of these two domains, we generated a G1G3 construct to examine interdomain interaction. Its expression and secretion were analyzed as above. More G1G3 product was observed in the cell lysate than in the culture medium (Fig.6). This suggested that secretion of the G3 product is inhibited by G1 when the two domains are physically linked. The G3 domain is composed of two EGF-like motifs, a CRD-like motif and a CBP-like motif. When the two EGF-like motifs were deleted from the G3 domain, the resulting G3ΔEGF construct was synthesized by transfected cells and secreted to the medium at the same levels as the G3 product itself (Fig. 7 A). Aggrecan G3 domain, which does not contain any EGF-like motifs, showed similar behavior. Consistent results were also observed when the two EGF-like motifs were removed from the miniversican construct. Miniversican and versicanΔEGF showed comparable levels of biosynthesis, GAG chain attachment, and product secretion (Fig. 7 B). When CRD and CBP constructs were transfected into COS-7 cells, their products were secreted to the culture media (Fig.8 A). However, CBP was synthesized and secreted in greater amounts than was CRD. Concomitant with this, CBP products showed higher levels of modification by glycosaminoglycan chains and product secretion, resulting in more intense smears on the blot. To test the effects of the CRD and CBP motifs on GAG chain attachment to the CS sequence, COS-7 cells were transfected with constructs lacking EGF-like motif plus one of these two motifs (G1CSCRD and G1CSCBP constructs). Three days after transfection, culture media and cell lysate were prepared and analyzed on Western blot. The results revealed that GAG chains attached to the core proteins of both constructs; however, the levels of GAG chain modification were significantly higher on the G1CSCBP products than on G1CSCRD products (Fig. 8 B). The synthesis and secretion of the G1 and G3 constructs were also examined in cell types other than COS-7 cells. Both constructs were transiently expressed in astrocytoma cell line U87 and NIH3T3 fibroblasts. Analysis of culture medium and cell lysate from transfected cultures indicated that the products of G1 were poorly secreted as compared with G3 products, although both constructs were well synthesized (Fig. 9). Versican, also known as PG-M, is a member of the large aggregating chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan family (1.Zimmermann D.R. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2975-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 3.Shinomura T. Nishida Y. Ito K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14461-14469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Chem. 1998; 273: 21342-21352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and inhibited cell differentiation (19.Zhang Y. Cao L. Yang B.L. Yang B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33054-33063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) via the G3 domain. This study was motivated by reports indicating that the G1 and G3 domains of aggrecan are also important in the synthesis and secretion of this proteoglycan (25.Luo W. Kuwada T.S. Chandrasekaran L. Zheng J. Tanzer M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16447-16450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 32.Zheng J. Luo W. Tanzer M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12999-13006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The roles of versican G1 and G3 domains are not yet defined, but since versican expression is highly regulated during tissue development and maturation, we investigated the possibility that the G1 and G3 domains of versican play a part in this regulation. To perform this study, we found it necessary to substitute the link protein leading peptide for the versican signal peptide, to permit maximal secretion of secretable products, since preliminary studies showed that constructs containing the versican signal peptide were retained within the cells. The presence of this peptide also allowed detection of all constructs using a single antibody (4B6, which recognizes an epitope in the link protein leading peptide). We observed that products of the G1 and G3 constructs containing the link protein leading peptide were able to secrete to the culture media. However, comparison of the levels of G1 and G3 products in the culture medium and in the cell lysate indicated that product secretion of G1 was inhibited. This result was confirmed in studies comparing a miniversican construct with a miniversican construct lacking the G1 domain (CSG3) and comparing a G1CS construct with a CS construct. In all cases, expression and secretion of the G1-containing constructs were reduced compared with controls. The inhibition of G1 secretion and promotion of G3 secretion were also observed in NIH3T3 fibroblasts and astrocytoma cell line U87. Given that the CS sequence by itself was well synthesized, modified by GAG chains, and secreted, the addition of G1 to this sequence had dramatic inhibitory effects on its synthesis, GAG chain attachment, and product secretion. On the other hand, G3's stimulatory effects on synthesis and secretion were not evident in the CSG3 construct, since CS was already synthesized and secreted at high levels. The effects of G3 were seen by contrasting the G1CS construct and G1CSG3 (miniversican) construct, since the inclusion of G3 led to increased GAG chain attachment and secretion. Although versican is expressed in a variety of tissues, its expression is strictly regulated. For example, versican expression is highly elevated in the early stages of development (7.Kimata K. Oike Y. Tani K. Shinomura T. Yamagata M. Uritani M. Suzuki S. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13517-13525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Shinomura T. Jensen K.L. Yamagata M. Kimata K. Solursh M. Anat. Embryol. 1990; 181: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). As a result, developing mesenchymes contain high levels of versican. In these stages, versican may enhance cell proliferation and the growth of limb buds as we have demonstrated that versican stimulated growth of NIH3T3 fibroblast (18.Zhang Y. Cao L. Yang B.L. Yang B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 21342-21352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) and chicken chondrocytes (30.Zhang Y. Cao L. Kiani C. Yang B.L. Hu W. Yang B.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1999; 73: 445-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). However, during maturation, versican expression is significantly down-regulated (13.Zimmermann D.R. Dours-Zimmermann M.T. Schubert M. Bruckner-Tuderman L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 817-825Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), and the mature cartilage contains small amounts of versican that are only detected with reverse transcription-PCR techniques (33.Grover J. Roughley P. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 361-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Versican expression may be down-regulated to allow cell differentiation. We earlier demonstrated that versican inhibits mesenchymal chondrogenesis (19.Zhang Y. Cao L. Yang B.L. Yang B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33054-33063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), and versican expression has been shown to be up- and down-regulated during hair growth cycles (14.du Cros D.L. LeBaron R.G. Couchman J.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 426-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar); versican expression is up-regulated during hair growth and down-regulated just before hair enters the next cycle (14.du Cros D.L. LeBaron R.G. Couchman J.R. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 105: 426-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We speculate that versican is subjected to dual modes of regulation, mediated via G1 and G3 domains. Cells may have developed pathways that allow versican up- or down-regulation (via G3 or G1, respectively) during various stages, to promote or inhibit cell growth and differentiation. In tissues where moderate levels of versican are required, both G1- and G3-regulating pathways would function to permit moderate expression and maintain a balance in versican expression. The significance of the effects of G1 and G3 on GAG chain attachment are not immediately clear. Two lines of evidence suggest that regulation of GAG chain attachment may be important during tissue development. It has been reported that attachment of GAG chains changes during tissue growth, and the types and numbers of GAG chains vary during different growth stages (34.Block J.A. Inerot S.E. Gitelis S. Kimura J.H. Am. J. Bone Joint Surg. 1991; 73: 647-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the GAG chains of versican have been reported to be involved in reducing cell adhesion (35.Yamagata M. Suzuki S. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8012-8018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since a decrease in cell adhesion is required for cell proliferation, cell migration, and tissue outgrowth, it seems that G3's promotion of versican synthesis, GAG chain attachment, and product secretion are relevant to tissue growth. G1's ability to inhibit these processes may be required for cell differentiation and tissue maturation. Although the concentration of versican may change to meet the requirements for tissue growth and maturation, it is not known if G1 and G3 are directly involved in the synthesis and attachment of GAG chains to versican core protein during tissue growth and differentiation. In vitro observations could well differ from in vivo effects. The significance of G1-mediated inhibition and G3-mediated enhancement of GAG chain attachment in cell culture awaits confirmation in tissue studies. We thank Dr. Paul F.

Its expression is drastically up-regulated when an animal is fed a low fat, high carbohydrate diet after prolonged fasting. In this report, we describe the role of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) in the transactivation of the rat ACL promoter. ACL promoter activity was markedly stimulated by the overexpression of SREBP-1a and, to a lesser extent, by SREBP-2 in Alexander human hepatoma cells. The promoter elements responsive to SREBPs were located within the 55-base pair sequences from −114 to −60. The gel mobility shift assay revealed four SREBP-1a binding sites in this region. Of these four elements, the −102/−94 region, immediately upstream of the inverted Y-box, and the −70/−61 region, just adjacent to Sp1 binding site, played critical roles in SREBPs-mediated stimulation. The mutation in the inverted Y-box and the coexpression of dominant negative nuclear factor-Y (NF-Y) significantly attenuated the transactivation by SREBP-1a, suggesting that NF-Y binding is a prerequisite for SREBPs to activate the ACL promoter. However, the multiple Sp1 binding sites did not affect the transactivation of the ACL promoter by SREBPs. The binding affinity of SREBP-1a to SREs of the ACL promoter also was much higher than that of SREBP-2. The transactivation potencies of the chimeric SREBPs, of which the activation domains (70 amino acids of the amino terminus) were derived from the different species of their carboxyl-terminal region, were similar to those of SREBPs corresponding to their carboxyl termini. Therefore, it is suggested that the carboxyl-terminal portions of SREBPs containing DNA binding domains are important in determining their transactivation potencies to a certain promoter.

ATP citrate-lyase sterol regulatory element-binding protein sterol regulatory element low density lipoprotein LDL receptor nuclear factor-Y polymerase chain reaction polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ATP citrate-lyase (ACL)1is a cytosolic enzyme that catalyzes the cleavage of citrate into oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA (1Kornacker M.S. Ball E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1965; 54: 899-904Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). In liver and adipose tissue, this enzyme plays an important role in supplying acetyl-CoA for both fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis (2Gibson D.M. Lyons R.T. Scott D.F. Muto Y. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1972; 10: 187-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). As the specific inhibition of ACL in rats significantly decreases the plasma levels of triacylglycerol and cholesterol, ACL is expected to be a potential target for hypolipidemic intervention (3Gribble A.D. Ife R.J. Shaw A. McNair D. Novelli C.E. Bakewell S. Shah V.P. Dolle R.E. Groot P.H. Pearce N. Yates J. Tew D. Boyd H. Ashman S. Eggleston D.S. Haltiwanger R.C. Okafo G. J. Med.

The activity of ACL is mainly regulated at the level of transcription by diet regimen and insulin, like other lipogenic enzymes, such as fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (5Kim K.S. Park S.W. Kim Y.S. Biochem. Bhiophys. Res. Comm. 1992; 189: 264-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The sequences of the 5′ flanking region of the ACL gene are highly conserved in humans and rats, whereas there is no homology in the regions of the 5′ untranslated region and the first intron, suggesting that transcription is regulated in the same manner in these two species (6Kim K.S. Moon Y.A. Park S.W. Kim Y.S. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 759-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 7Park S.W. Moon Y.A. Kim K.S. Ahn Y.H. Kim Y.S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1353: 236-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Although ACL plays an important role in fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis and is highly controlled by diet at the transcription level, studies on the structure and function of this promoter have been very limited thus far. SREBPs are the transcription factors that regulate the transcription of many genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis, such as low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor, farnesyl-pyrophosphate synthase, squalene synthase, hydroxymethylglutary-CoA reductase, hydroxymethylglutary-CoA synthase, fatty acid synthase, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (8Wang X.

Nascent SREBPs reside in the endoplasmic reticulum and the nuclear envelope as precursor forms (13Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Cell. 1997; 89: 331-340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2963) Google Scholar). The transcriptionally acitive amino-terminal segments are released from the precursor SREBPs by a sequential two-step cleavage process. Once cleaved, the amino-terminal segment translocates into the nucleus where it binds to sterol regulatory elements (SREs) in the promoters of target genes. Three isoforms of SREBPs have been identified. SREBP-1a and -1c are derived from a single gene, using different transcription start sites. SREBP-1c is known as a weak activator because of its short acidic domain. SREBP-2 is transcribed from a separate gene, and it shows about 50% sequence homology to SREBP-1 isoforms. The in vivoroles of the SREBP isoforms have been characterized in transgenic mice overexpressing active forms of each isoform (14Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar, 15Shimano H. Horton J.D. Shimomura I. Hammer R.E. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin.

Invest. 1998; 101: 2331-2339Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Those reports have shown that SREBP-1 is associated more with the genes involved in fatty acid synthesis, whereas SREBP-2 preferentially stimulates genes involved in cholesterol synthesis. For example, transgenic mice that overexpress the active forms of SREBP-1a and -1c showed more elevated expression of the mRNAs of lipogenic enzymes such as fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase than those of the LDL receptor and other cholesterogenic enzymes. Recent reports have shown that SREBP-1 might be the potential transactivator that mediates lipogenic enzyme gene regulation during the fasting/refeeding cycle. Refeeding a high carbohydrate/low fat diet following long-term fasting up-regulates the nuclear concentration of mature SREBP-1 and its mRNA in adipose tissue and liver (17Kim J.B. Sarraf P.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 5987-5992Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Recently, insulin was reported to increase SREBP-1c mRNA in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat liver and isolated hepatocytes, and SREBP-1c was suggested as possibly mediating insulin action upon regulation of the genes involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism (19Foretz M. Guichard C. Ferre P. Foufelle F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12737-12742Crossref PubMed Scopus (590) Google Scholar, 20Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Ikemoto S. Horton J.D. Brown M.S.

However, the action of the SREBPs on the promoters of lipogenic enzymes is confirmed in only a few genes, which include fatty acid synthase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase, and glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (21Magana M.M.

Thus, studies on SREBP activation of other lipogenic genes including ACL may add more data for the generalization of the hypothesis. In this study, we demonstrate that SREBPs stimulate the ACL promoter through their binding to an upstream promoter region and that the activation requires NF-Y binding. We also show that SREBP-1a and -2 have different potencies in activating the ACL promoter derived from their carboxyl-terminal domain and not from the amino-terminal activation domain. Alexander cells obtained from ATCC were cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 unit/ml penicillin G-sodium, 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. All cell culture materials were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The rat ACL promoter fragments spanning −1860 to +67, −419 to +67, −99 to +67, and −60 to +67 were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using Pfu polymerase and respective primers based on the sequences reported previously (6Kim K.S. Moon Y.A. Park S.W. Kim Y.S. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 759-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The amplified fragments were gel-purified with a Qiaquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen Inc.) and then subcloned into the SmaI site of pGL3-basic plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI). The ACL promoter-luciferase constructs were designated as pACL1860, pACL419, pACL99 and pACL60, respectively. Plasmid pACL114 construct was generated by the deletion of the SacI fragment of −419 to −115 from pACL419. Mutant constructs were generated from pACL114 and pACL419 with the mutagenic oligonucleotides (20 mer) using the QuikChangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutated sequences are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. The sequences of all the constructs were confirmed using the T7 sequencing kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The construct of p5xSRE-tk was generated by inserting 5 copies of LDLR SRE1 sequence I into SacI site and herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter into SmaI and XhoI sites of pGL3-basic plasmid. All transfection plasmids were prepared with the Qiagen Plasmid Midi Kit (Qiagen Inc.).Figure 4SREBP-1a binds to the upstream region containing the inverted Y-box of the ACL promoter.

On the following day, transfection was performed with 0.4 μg of the indicated ACL promoter-luciferase constructs, 0.2 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid (CLONTECH), and the indicated amounts of pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) or SREBP expression plasmids pCSA10 or pCS2. Plasmid pCSA10, which encodes amino acids 1–490 of SREBP-1a, and pCS2, which encodes amino acids 1–485 of SREBP-2, were provided by Dr. T. Osborne (University of California, Irvine). The chimeric SREBPs constructs (Fig. 5) were generated as follows: the BglII restriction site was introduced into pCSA10 and pCS2 at the 70th codon of SREBPs cDNA, and the EcoRI-BglII fragments (220 base pairs) corresponding to activation domains were exchanged between pCSA10 and pCS2. Plasmid pmYA (Δ4YA13 m29), which encodes the dominant negative form of the A subunit of NF-Y, was also used in the indicated transfection experiment; it was provided by Dr. R. Mantovani (University of Milan, Italy) (26Mantovani R. Li X.Y. Pessara U. Huisjduijnen H. Benoist C. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20340-20346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Transfection was performed using FuGENE6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 6 h according to the manufacturer's instructions. After 2 days, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc.) and lysed in 200 μl of reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activities were measured using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and normalized with β-galactosidase activities (27Hall C.V. Jacob P.E. Ringold G.M. Lee F. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1983; 2: 101-109PubMed Google Scholar) to correct the transfection efficiency. Relative luciferase activity is expressed as the normalized luciferase activity per microgram of protein. Recombinant human SREBPs were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS. SREBP expression vectors pET-SREBP-1a and pET-SREBP-2 were generated by inserting the cDNA fragments from pCSA10 and pCSA2, respectively, between the EcoRI and SalI sites of pET-21a (Novagen). The bacteria freshly transformed with each expression vector were grown to mid-log phase, and proteins were induced for 4 h with 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and disrupted by sonication. The recombinant proteins containing amino-terminal T7 and carboxyl-terminal polyhistidine (His6) tag were purified to homogeneity by Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) chromatography. The purity and concentration of the recombinant proteins were verified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electorphoresis followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. Nuclear extracts were prepared from the livers of Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats (weighing about 200 g) according to the procedures described previously by Gorski et al. (28Gorski K. Carneiro M. Schibler U. Cell. 1986; 47: 767-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (972) Google Scholar). The probes corresponding to nucleotides −142 to +67 of the ACL promoter were generated by PCR using pACL419 as a template. 32P-labeled sense oligonucleotides (nucleotides −142 to −116) and unlabeled antisense oligonucleotides (+36 to +67) were used to label the sense strand, whereas 32P-labeled antisense oligonucleotides (−20 to +5) and unlabeled sense oligonucleotides (−142 to −116) were used as primers to label the antisense strand. The PAGE-purified probes (50,000 cpm) were incubated with 0, 1, 2, and 4 μg of purified SREBP-1a for 20 min on ice in 50 μl of reaction buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 7% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). Then, DNase I (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) diluted in 50 μl of 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mmCaCl2 was added to the DNA-protein binding reactions. After a 2-min incubation at room temperature, the digestion reactions were stopped by adding 100 μl of stop buffer containing 1% (w/v) SDS, 200 mm NaCl, 20 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 0.1 μg/μl glycogen. The DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform and recovered by ethanol precipitation. The pellets were dissolved in loading buffer and then resolved on denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel. The footprints were compared with the G+A ladder produced by the chemical cleavage sequencing reaction of the same probe to determine the corresponding nucleotide sequences. The probes corresponding to nucleotides −99 to −41 and −142 to −80 of the ACL promoter were generated by PCR using 32P-labeled primers (20 mer) and pACL419 plasmid as a template. To generate mutant probes, corresponding mutant pACL419 plasmids were used as templates. The PAGE-purified probes (20,000 cpm) were incubated with purified recombinant SREBPs (1 μg) or liver nuclear extract (7.5 μg) in a final volume of 20 μl containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 75 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and 0.5% BSA. After a 20 min incubation at room temperature, samples were resolved on a 4% polyacrylamide gel in 1× TBE (45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA) at 200 V for approximately 1 h at 4 °C. For the competition assays, unlabeled oligonucleotides indicated in the figures were added to the reactions at an approximately 100-fold molar excess. For the NF-Y supershift assay, the antibody against the B subunit of NF-Y (0.2 μg), provided by Dr. R. Mantovani, was added to the reactions. The sequences (coding strands) of the oligonucletides used in the competition assays are as follows: NF-Y, 5′-GGGGTAGGAACCAATGAAATGAAAGGT-3′ (29Raymondjean M. Cereghini C. Yaniv M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar); LDL receptor-SRE1, 5′-TTTGAAAATCACCCCACTGCAAAC-3′ (9Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol.

To determine whether SREBPs are able to activate the rat ACL promoter and to focus on the responsive regions, we prepared a series of plasmid constructs containing the various lengths of the rat ACL promoter linked to the luciferase gene. ACL promoter-reporter constructs and the putative binding sites of transcription factors are shown in Fig.1. The nucleotide sequence is numbered based on the published sequence of the rat ACL gene (6Kim K.S. Moon Y.A. Park S.W. Kim Y.S. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 759-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Promoter-reporter constructs were transiently transfected into the Alexander cells in the presence or absence of pCSA10 or pCS2 encoding the mature form of human SREBP-1a or SREBP-2, respectively (Fig. 1). The luciferase activity indicating ACL promoter activity was increased by the overexpression of SREBP-1a and SREBP-2. In most constructs tested, SREBP-1a showed higher activation than SREBP-2. The level of promoter activities of pACL1860 and pACL419 were almost the same in presence or absence of SREBPs. Nucleotide sequence analysis showed six Sp1 binding sites and one NF-Y binding site in the region from −419 to +67 (6Kim K.S. Moon Y.A. Park S.W. Kim Y.S. Biochem. J. 1994; 302: 759-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Deletion of five Sp1 binding sites (pACL114) markedly decreased the basal transcription to 16% relative to that of pACL419. However, the luciferase activity of pACL114 could be highly induced to the level of 98% and 58% of the induced activity of pACL419 by SREBP-1a and −2, respectively. Further deletion to nucleotide −100 (pACL99) reduced the enhancement by SREBP-1a and -2 to the level of 43 and 70%, respectively, of the induced activity of pACL114. Deletion to −61 (pACL60) abolished the basal transcription activity and the transactivation of SREBPs. The constructs pACL114Δ(−99/−80) and pACL114Δ(−79/−60), which were generated from pACL114 by deleting the region from −99 to −80 and from −79 to −60, respectively, significantly decreased the induction by SREBPs. These results demonstrated that the SREs responsible for the induction of ACL promoter activity by SREBPs exist in the region from −114 to −60. To localize the SREBP-1a binding sites in the region from −114 to −60 of the ACL promoter, DNase I footprinting was performed using purified recombinant human SREBP-1a expressed in E. coli (Fig. 2). SREBP-1a protected two regions, from −72 to −57 and from −88 to −113, adjacent to the inverted Y-box. The inverse sequence of −71 to −62 (GTGAGCTGAT/ATCAGCTCAC) has 80% homology to SRE1 (ATCACCCCAC) identified in the promoter of LDL receptor (8Wang X. Briggs M.R. Hua X. Yokoyama C. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14497-14504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence from −116 to −107 (CTCAGGCTAG) has 90% homology to SRE3 (CTCAGCCTAG) of glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase promoter (25Ericsson J. Jackson S.M. Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7298-7305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). To confirm the SREBP binding to these two footprinted regions, gel retardation assays were done. We prepared downstream (−99/−41) and upstream probes (−142/−80) covering the protected regions (Figs.3 A and 4 A). SREBP-1a produced two shifted bands with −99/−41 probe (Fig.3 B), of which the upper band was the complex containing two molecules of SREBP-1a. When the LDLR-SRE1 sequence was added to the reaction as a competitor, both shifted bands disappeared completely. Although competitor −102/−73, containing inverted Y-box, slightly decreased the complex formation, neither the conserved NF-Y binding sequence reported nor the Sp1-binding sequence, which exists in the ACL promoter (−67/−41), competed complex formation. To determine the precise binding sites for SREBP-1a, we introduced mutations in the probes (Fig. 3 A). The substitutions of three base pairs in the conserved SRE1 region of −99/−41 probe produced the mutant oligonucleotides m1 and m2, which formed complexes with the SREBP-1a at significantly lower but still detectable levels (Fig. 3 C). The mutation of the inverted Y-box (CCAAT) to CGTTT (m4) slightly decreased the formation of the complex and prevented the formation of complex containing two molecules of SREBP-1a (Fig. 3 C). The mutations in both conserved SRE1 and inverted Y-box (m2+4) completely inhibited binding of SREBP-1a to the probe (Fig. 3 C). Because all probes were generated by PCR using the same32P-labeled antisense primer (−60/−41) and then PAGE-purified, the differences in intensity between shifted bands were not caused by the differences in the specific activities between wild type and mutant probes. These results suggest that SREBP-1a binds not only to the conserved SRE1 sequence but also weakly to the inverted Y-box in the ACL promoter. When the −99/−41 probe was incubated with nuclear extracts isolated from rat liver, one major shifted band was present (Fig. 3 D,lane 1). This band disappeared when anti-NF-YB antibody was added to the reaction (Fig. 3 D, lane 2), suggesting that this band was produced by the binding of NF-Y. The NF-Y band was not present if the mutated inverted Y-box (m4) was used as a probe (Fig. 3 D, lanes 5–8). When SREBP-1a was added to the reaction, an additional shifted band with lower mobility, which was not clearly separated from the complex containing two molecules of SREBP-1a, was produced as well as the bands formed by NF-Y or SREBP-1a alone (Fig. 3 D, lane 3). This additional band is produced presumably by the binding of both NF-Y and SREBP-1a, because this complex was supershifted by the anti-NF-YB antibody (Fig. 3 D, lane 4), and the addition of SREBP-1a diminished the complex formed by NF-Y alone. The upstream probe, −142−80 (Fig.4 A), also produced the three shifted bands with SREBP-1a (Fig. 4 B). The binding of SREBP-1a was completely competed by the conserved SRE1 sequence of the LDL receptor promoter but was not competed by the conserved Y-box (29Raymondjean M. Cereghini C. Yaniv M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 757-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) or the oligonucleotide (−142/−116) that contained the Sp1 binding. The unlabeled oligonucleotide (−102/−73), containing the inverted Y-box, slightly decreased the complex formation in a manner similar to that observed in the experiment with the −99/−41 probe (Fig.4 B, lane 4). To determine the SREBP-1 binding sites, a gel mobility shift assay was performed with mutant probes generated by PCR using the same 32P-labeled sense primer (−142/−123). SREBP-1a binding to m5 and m7 mutants was slightly decreased (Fig. 4 C, lanes 2 and 4). Introducing a double mutation (m5+7) nearly abolished the SREBP-1a binding (Fig.4 C, lane 5), and the shifted bands were completely abolished by triple mutations (m4+5+7) (data not shown). However, the mutation outside the potential protein binding sites (m6) did not affect SREBP-1a binding. Mutant m5, which has mutations 3 base pairs away from CCAAT, did not affect NF-Y binding (data not shown). These gel retardation results show that NF-Y binds to the inverted Y-box and that SREBP-1a binds to four regions, designated as regions A, B, C, and the inverted Y-box (Figs. 3 A and4 A). Although both SREBP-1a and SREBP-2 have almost the same potencies to activate the transcription of p5xSRE-tk, which contains five copies of LDLR-SRE1 at the upstream of herpes simplex thymidine kinase promoter, SREBP-2 was a much less effective activator than SREBP-1a for the ACL promoter (Fig.5 A). Among the several possibilities that may explain the different potencies, we first compared the binding affinities of SREBP-1a and -2 with the ACL promoter SREs. Although SREBP-1a showed no difference in binding to the LDLR-SRE1 and ACL SREs, SREBP-2 bound to the ACL SREs much less efficiently than to the LDLR-SRE1 (Fig. 5 B). Therefore, the different affinities of SREBPs to multiple SREs in ACL promoter might explain the differences in their transactivation activities. However, it is still possible that the amino-terminal activation domains of these factors might have different compatibilities to the ACL promoter. To rule out this possibility, we constructed two kinds of plasmids, p2A-1aD and p1aA-2D expressing chimeric SREBPs, of which the sequences for the amino-terminal activation domain (amino acids 1–70) were exchanged as illustrated in Fig. 5 C. The p2A-1aD could induce the ACL promoter as efficiently as pCSA10, whereas p1aA-2D induced it to a lesser extent, similar to pCS2 (Fig. 5 D). This finding suggests that the potencies of SREBPs in transactivating the ACL promoter depend on the carboxyl-terminal portion of SREBPs but not the amino-terminal activation domains and that the binding affinity of SREBPs to the promoter elements is an important factor in determining the potency of transactivation. To evaluate the functional significance of the SREBP binding elements and the inverted Y-box in the ACL promoter, a transient transfection experiment was performed. The mutant clones, basically produced from pACL114, were transiently transfected into Alexander cells, and their responsiveness to SREBP-1a was tested (Fig.6). The constructs have mutations that prevented the binding of SREBP-1a and/or NF-Y in the gel mobility shift assays (Fig. 3, 4). Any single mutation did not completely abolish the responsiveness of pACL114 to SREBPs. Mutation at conserved SRE1 in region C (m2) and at nucleotides in region B immediately upstream of the inverted Y-box (m5) significantly decreased activation by SREBPs without changing the basal transcription activity. However, the m7 mutation did not affect the activation, even though it also prevented the SREBP1a binding in gel mobility shift assay. As region A exists at the vector-promoter junction in pACL114, we could not exclude the possibility that the neighboring vector sequences altered the binding affinity to SREBP-1a and thereby made this site nonfunctional. The double mutations at regions B and C (m2+5) completely abolished the responsiveness of the ACL promoter to SREBP-1a without a decrease in basal activity. The mutation at the inverted Y-box (m4) significantly decreased the basal promoter activity as well as the responsiveness to SREBP-1a. The double mutations at region C and the inverted Y-box (m2+4) decreased the basal promoter activity to a level similar to that of m4 and decreased stimulation of the ACL promoter by SREBP-1a. The mutations at the most proximal Sp1 binding site (mSp1) did not affect the responsiveness of SREBP-1a. Because both SREBP1a and NF-Y can bind to the inverted Y-box of the ACL promoter, we needed to determine which was the responsible factor for the decrease of responsiveness to SREBP-1a shown in the constructs containing the mutations at the inverted Y-box (m4). By using the dominant negative mutant of NF-Y, pmYA, which encodes the mutated A subunit of NF-Y lacking an ability to bind to NF-Y consensus sequence (26Mantovani R. Li X.Y. Pessara U. Huisjduijnen H. Benoist C. Mathis D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20340-20346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we could exclude the NF-Y binding effect. When pmYA was added, the stimulation of the ACL promoter activity by SREBP-1a and -2 was effectively suppressed almost to the basal level (Fig. 7 A). However, SREBP-1a-induced activation of p5xSRE-tk was not changed by adding pmYA. We could obtain the same result when the construct containing mutations at the inverted Y-box (m4) was used (data not shown). These results suggested that NF-Y binding to the inverted Y-box is required for the effective transactivation of the ACL promoter by SREBPs.Figure 7The stimulation of ACL promoter-luciferase construct by SREBPs is dependent on NF-Y. The indicated amounts of pCSA10 or pCS2 along with 0.4 μg of pACL114 and 0.2 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase plasmid were transfected into Alexander cells (A). Plasmid pcDNA3 (0.4 μg) or pmYA29 (0.4 μg) encoding a dominant negative form of NF-YA was cotransfected as indicated. The plasmid p5xSRE-tk (0.4 μg) was transfected with 40 ng of pCSA10 and 0.4 μg of pmYA as indicated (B). The plasmid pUC9 was used to make the total amount of transfected DNA equal. Two days after transfection, luciferase activities were measured. Normalized luciferase activities expressed as the mean ± S.E. from three independent experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) SREBPs are known as a family of transcription factors that regulate the genes involved in fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. It has been suggested that SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 have different effects on target genes, that is, SREBP-1 preferentially activates genes involved in fatty acid synthesis and SREBP-2 activates genes involved in cholesterol synthesis. Recent reports have suggested that SREBPs stimulates the expression of ACL gene and that SREBP-1a would be a more specific factor. Shimomura et al. (30Shimomura I. Shimano H. Korn B.S. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35299-35306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar) reported that the level of mRNA for ACL was elevated by 3- to 4-fold in transgenic mice overexpressing the mature form of SREBP-1a or -1c and by 1.5-fold in transgenic mice overexpressing SREBP-2. In this study, we demonstrate that the rat ACL promoter is highly activated by the direct interaction of SREBPs with multiple SREs on the ACL promoter, and that SREBP-1a is more effective activator than SREBP-2. In addition, we show that the binding affinities of these SREBPs to ACL SREs determine their potency in this promoter, supporting previous reports that SREBPs have preferential target genes. In the ACL promoter, the region between nucleotides −114 and −60 was the major determinant for the activation by SREBPs. The recombinant SREBP-1a strongly bound to three regions, A, B, and C, in the proximal promoter of the ACL gene. The SRE in region C (GTGAGCTGA) bears sequences homologous to SRE1, which has been found in many target genes of SREBPs. As expected, mutations at region C significantly reduced the responsiveness to SREBPs without decreasing basal activity of ACL promoter. The SRE in region B, the upstream region of the inverted Y-box, showed a novel sequence (5′-AACGCGTGTG-3′; −104 to −95) differing from known consensus SREs. The mutation at region B prevented the binding of SREBP-1a (Fig. 4 C) without changing NF-Y binding (data not shown) and also decreased the stimulation of ACL promoter by SREBP-1a (Fig. 6). Region A has sequences highly homologous to SRE3, which was reported in glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase promoter. However, mutations in region A (m7) did not alter the responsiveness to SREBPs, even though SREBP-1a showed strong affinity to this region and its binding was significantly reduced to the mutant probe (m7). The fact that mutations at both SREs in region B and C resulted in complete loss of responsiveness of the ACL promoter to SREBP-1a suggested that these two SREs play important roles in SREBP-mediated regulation. The importance of the Sp1 binding sites for the action of SREBPs has been reported in many promoters, such as LDL receptor (31Sanchez H.B. Yieh L. Osborne T.F J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1161-1169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (22Lopez J.M. Bennett M.K. Sanchez H.B. Rosenfeld J.M. Osborne T.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar), and fatty acid synthase promoter (32Bennett M.K. Lopez J.M. Sanchez H.B. Osborne T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 25578-25583Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). But in the case of ACL, although the deletion of five upstream Sp1 binding sites decreased the basal activity of the ACL promoter, it did not alter the effect of SREBPs activating the ACL promoter (Fig. 1). Also, the mutation of the most proximal Sp1 binding site downstream of region C did not affect the activation by SREBPs (Fig. 6). On the other hand, the responsiveness to SREBPs was markedly reduced when the binding of NF-Y was disturbed by the mutation at the inverted Y-box or by the overexpression of the dominant negative form of NF-YA (Figs. 6 and7). These results indicate that the regulation of the ACL promoter by SREBPs requires the neighboring binding of NF-Y, as was observed in farnesyl-pyrophosphate synthase, squalene synthase, hydroxymethylglutary-CoA synthase, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, and SREBP-2 genes (9Ericsson J.

The amino-terminal 60 amino acid region of SREBP-1a is known to be an activation domain that interacts with multiprotein complex including CREB-binding protein (34Naar A.M. Beaurang P.A.

Abraham S. Solomon W. Tjian R. Nature. 1999; 398: 828-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). SREBP-1c, which is derived from the same gene as SREBP-1a by using different transcription start site, is known as a weak activator because of its short amino-terminal region (36Shimomura I. Shimano H. Horton J.D. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 838-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (635) Google Scholar). However, the different potencies of SREBP-1a and -2 for the ACL promoter activation were not originated from their differences in activation domains. Instead, SREBP-2 showed much less affinity to SREs in the ACL promoter than SREBP-1a, and the chimeric SREBP, which has the SREBP-2 activation domain followed by remaining the carboxyl-terminal region of SREBP-1a, could activate the ACL promoter as efficiently as SREBP-1a itself. This finding implies that SREBPs can activate preferential target genes through their different affinities to SREs in the promoters. The mechanism by which SREBPs activate their preferential target genes has not been studied thus far. Therefore, it will be necessary to evaluate promoter selection by studying the binding affinity of SREBP isoforms in other promoters too. We appreciate Dr. T. Osborne for providing pCSA10 and pCS2 and Dr. R. Mantovani for providing Δ4YA13 m29 and the antibody against B subunit of NF-Y."

Therefore, all members of the MLK family may act as MAPKKK in the JNK/SAPK pathway. Members of the MLK family share a characteristic protein kinase domain that shows structural features of both tyrosine-specific and serine/threonine-specific protein kinases and two leucine-zipper-like motifs located at the C-terminal side of the kinase domain (20.Dorow D.S. Devereux L. Dietzsch E. De Kretser T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 701-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Despite these common features, members of the MLK family show considerable differences in their primary structures, and they comprise two subgroups that can be distinguished by the primary structure of the kinase domain and the presence or absence of an SH3 domain located at the N-terminal side of the kinase domain. The SH3-containing group of MLK includes MLK1, MST/MLK2, and SPRK/MLK3/PTK1. They also contain a Cdc42 and Rac interactive binding domain conserved among several Cdc42- and Rac-binding proteins such as PAK and WASP (21.Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar); this domain is heavily degenerated in members of another, non-SH3-containing group of MLK including MUK/DLK/ZPK and LZK. Such structural differences between these two groups suggest their different regulatory mechanisms and physiological functions. However, neither the molecular mechanism of the regulation of MLK activity nor the physiological function of the MLK-JNK/SAPK pathway has been explored. Nevertheless, there are some candidates for the upstream regulators of the SH3-containing group of MLK. Based on an analogy with a mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in budding yeast, it is expected that an STE20-like protein kinase acts as an activator of MAPKKK class protein kinases including MLKs. This possibility is supported by the observations that an STE20-like kinase, HPK1, interacts with SPRK/MLK3/PTK1 through the SH3 domain and that SPRK/MLK3/PTK1 can be phosphorylated by HPK1 in vitro (22.Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Although the effect of HPK1 interaction on the kinase activity of SPRK/MLK3/PTK1 has not been explored, this STE20-like kinase is a strong candidate for an upstream regulator of SH3-containing MLKs. On the other hand, the presence of a Cdc42 and Rac interactive binding site in those MLK members suggests the regulation of kinase activity by Rac and Cdc42, known activators of the JNK/SAPK pathway. In fact, the GTP-dependent binding of these small GTP-binding proteins to MST/MLK2 and SPRK/MLK3/PTK1 has been shown by overlay assay and by a yeast two-hybrid system (21.Burbelo P.D. Drechsel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar, 23.Nagata K.-i. Puls A. Futter C. Aspenstrom P. Schaefer E. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). However, the effect of Rac/Cdc42 binding on MLK activity is obscure, and the binding could be meaningful in the sense of the targeting of MST/MLK2 and SPRK/MLK3/PTK1 to a certain subcellular component (23.Nagata K.-i. Puls A. Futter C. Aspenstrom P. Schaefer E. Nakata T. Hirokawa N. Hall A. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 24.Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Miyata H. Igishi T. Miki T.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1395-1404Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). As to members of the SH3 domain noncontaining group of MLK, MUK/DLK/ZPK and LZK, information about upstream regulators is quite limited. There are some reports showing the possible involvement of MUK/DLK/ZPK in JNK/SAPK activation induced by Rac or C3G (15.Fan G. Merritt S.E. Kortenjann M. Shaw P. Holzman L.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24788-24793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 26.Tanaka S. Hanafusa H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1281-1284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, whether MUK/DLK/ZPK binds directly to and is activated by these proteins or not is obscure. On the other hand, MUK/DLK/ZPK as well as other MLKs include two leucine-zipper-like motifs, putative protein interaction domains, that could be essential for the MLK activity (13.Hirai S.-I. Izawa M. Osada S.-I. Spyrou G. Ohno S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 641-650PubMed Google Scholar, 27.Leung I.W.-L. Lassam N. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 32408-32415Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is conceivable that the MUK/DLK/ZPK activity is regulated by a certain protein interacting with these motifs. To identify such a regulatory protein binding directly to MUK/DLK/ZPK, we employed a yeast two-hybrid system. By using a part of MUK/DLK/ZPK protein including one of the two leucine-zipper-like motifs as a bait, we identified a MUK/DLK/ZPK-binding protein that specifically inhibits the MUK/DLK/ZPK activity to induce the activation of the JNK/SAPK pathway. Yeast strain Y190 cells were transformed first with a bait plasmid encoding a LexA DNA binding domain fused to a part of MUK (amino acids 453–604). A selected bait-containing clone was then transformed with plasmids containing human brain cDNA expression library clones fused to DNA encoding a GAL4 activation domain. From ∼2 × 107 transformants, we obtained 339 His+/LacZ+ clones, that originated from six distinct gene products. To obtain a cDNA clone including the full-length MBIP coding sequence, we screened a human kidney cDNA library using one of the initial isolates (clone3–3) encoding amino acid residues 171–344 of MBIP as a probe. Hybridization was done overnight at 65° C in 0.9 m NaCl, 90 mmTris-HCl, 6 mm EDTA, 5× Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml sonicated salmon sperm DNA, and 1 × 106cpm/ml of the cDNA probe. Filters were subsequently washed with 2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS twice at room temperature for 10 min and with 0.1× SSC containing 0.1% SDS twice at 65° C for 20 min, and they were exposed to x-ray films at −80° C. Multiple human tissue Northern blots (CLONTECH) were hybridized to a32P-labeled MBIP cDNA probe at 68° C for 1 h and washed at 50° C for 40 min to a final stringency of 0.1× SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS before exposure to x-ray film. The expression vectors for MUK and Cot were constructed with a mammalian expression vector containing an EF1 promoter and a cDNA encoding rat MUK (13.Hirai S.-I. Izawa M. Osada S.-I. Spyrou G. Ohno S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 641-650PubMed Google Scholar) or human Cot (kindly provided by Dr. Jun Miyoshi). The expression vectors for MBIP and its deletion mutants were constructed with a mammalian expression vector SRα. The expression vector for T7-tagged JNK1 and GST-SEK1 has been described elsewhere (13.Hirai S.-I. Izawa M. Osada S.-I. Spyrou G. Ohno S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 641-650PubMed Google Scholar, 19.Hirai S.-I. Noda K. Moriguchi T. Nishida E. Yamashita A. Deyama T. Fukuyama K. Ohno S. J. Biol.

COS-1 cells were transfected by an electroporation method using 15 μg of DNA for 6 × 106 cells. After transfection, the cells were seeded in three 10-cm dishes and further cultured for 40 h before harvest. 293T cells were transfected by calcium phosphate co-precipitation methods at a density of 5 × 105cells/6-cm dish. After a 10-h exposure to the calcium phosphate-DNA precipitate, the medium was changed, and cells were further cultured for 20 h before harvest. We used a relatively large amount of SRα-expression vector compared with the EF-1-expression vector (>100-fold), because the EF-1 promoter is more active than the SRα promoter in 293T cells. COS-1 cells were transfected by electroporation and seeded on coverslips. The cells were cultured for 40 h and fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min. After washing with PBS, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min, washed again with PBS, and incubated with TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) containing 10% calf serum for 30 min at room temperature. The cells were then incubated with primary antibodies, anti-MUK antibody raised against the C-terminal part of MUK or anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody tag (Sigma), for 60 min at 37° C, and washed three times for 15 min each with TBST. After incubation with secondary antibodies, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Cappel) and Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), the cells were washed three times for 15 min each with TBST. Samples were observed under an OLYMPUS BX50, and images were captured with a Princeton Instruments digital camera. COS-1 cells grown in 10-cm dishes were lysed in 200 μl of lysis buffer consisting 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml leupeptine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.0% Triton X-100. The epitope-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitate-carried at 4° C for 1 h using 1 μg of anti-T7 tag monoclonal antibody (Novagen) or anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody tag (Sigma) prefixed on 5 μl of protein G-Sepharose 4 Fast Flow (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The Sepharose resin was washed five times with lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitated protein was eluted with SDS-sample buffer for Western blot analysis. 293T cells transfected with expression vectors were collected directly in SDS-sample buffer. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The blotted membrane was soaked in PBS containing 5% skim milk overnight at 4° C. The membrane was then incubated with appropriately diluted anti-active JNK pAb (pTPpY) (Promega), phosphospecific SEK1/MKK4 antibody (Thr223) (New England Biolabs), anti-T7 tag monoclonal antibody (Novagen), anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma), or anti-GST antibody in TBST containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at 37° C. After washing with TBST, the membrane was incubated with peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit or mouse IgG antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in TBST containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The membrane was washed again and the specific bands were visualized with an ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 293T cells were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (10% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium). The cells were transfected with the MBIP expression vector or empty vector together with the T7-JNK1 expression vector by calcium phosphate co-precipitation methods at a density of 2 × 105 cells/6-cm dish. After a 10-h exposure to the calcium phosphate-DNA precipitate, the medium was changed to fresh 10% fetal bovine serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and the cells were further cultured for 24 h. The cells were then stimulated with 0.3m sorbitol for 5, 15, 60, or 120 min, heat shock at 44° for 15 min, or 100 ng/ml TNFα for 15 min, and the cells were washed with PBS and lysed in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. To isolate cDNA clones encoding MUK-binding proteins, we employed a yeast two-hybrid system using part of MUK including a leucine-zipper-like motif and a cluster of basic amino acids as bait (see Ref. 13.Hirai S.-I. Izawa M. Osada S.-I. Spyrou G. Ohno S. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 641-650PubMed Google Scholar and Fig.4). By screening ∼2 × 107 clones of a human brain cDNA library, we identified 339 positive clones originating from six different gene products. The expression of proteins encoded by one of these clones, clone 3–3, in 293T cells resulted in the inhibition of the overexpressed MUK activity to induce JNK activation, whereas no significant effect was observed with the other clones (data not shown). Therefore, we chose clone 3–3 for further analyses. To isolate cDNA clones encoding the entire protein, a human kidney cDNA library was screened using a 3–3 cDNA fragment as a probe. Among 16 cDNA clones isolated, the complete sequences of 2 clones containing the 5′- or 3′-parts of the long open reading frame were determined (Fig. 1, A andB). The open reading frame encodes 344 amino acids, and the nucleotides franking the initiation codon fulfill Kozack's consensus sequence (28.Kozak M. Cell. 1986; 44: 283-292Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3589) Google Scholar). In addition, in-frame termination codons were found in the 5′-nontranslated sequence, and a poly(A) addition signal was identified 22 base pairs upstream of the poly (A) tail in the 3′-nontranslated sequence (Fig. 1 B). Importantly, the reading frame is the same as that of clone 3–3 on the yeast expression vector, which covers the C-terminal part (Fig. 1 A). Taken together, these structural features indicate that this open reading frame is translated into a protein harboring a MUK binding region in the C-terminal part. We named this protein MBIP: MUKbinding inhibitory protein.Figure 1Structure and expression of MBIP.A, structure of human cDNA clones encoding MBIP.

Lane 1, heart; lane 2, brain;lane 3, placenta; lane 4, lung; lane 5, liver; lane 6, skeletal muscle; lane 7, kidney; lane 8, pancreas. The arrowhead indicates the position of the 1.8-kilobase (kb) MBIP mRNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) MBIP shows no significant homology in its primary structure with any other proteins in the GenBankTM data base, although we could find several human expressed sequence tag clones that together covered almost the entire MBIP sequence. MBIP contains two leucine-zipper-like motifs that are predicted to form short amphipathic α-helixes (Fig. 1 C). The joining region between the two leucine-zipper-like motifs is 28 amino acids long and includes a cluster of basic amino acids related to an SV40T-type nuclear localization sequence (Fig. 1 B). The mouse expressed sequence tag clone AA879837 covers part of the mouse MBIP including the leucine-zipper-like motifs; the amino acid sequence of mouse MBIP is mostly identical to that of human MBIP except that Gln326is replaced by Arg in the mouse sequence. The mRNA for MBIP is present ubiquitously in different human tissues (Fig. 1 D), with relatively high expression seen in the heart and lung. The length of the mRNA is estimated to be approximately 1.8 kilobases long. Therefore, the nucleotide sequence shown in Fig. 1 B covers nearly the entire MBIP mRNA. Because the clones we isolated using the yeast two-hybrid system cover only the C-terminal half of MBIP, the interaction with MUK could depend on an artificial structure created by the loss of the N-terminal half. To rule out this possibility, we tested the binding of the full MBIP and MUK. Epitope-tagged proteins were transiently overexpressed in COS-1 cells, and binding was examined by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting analysis. As shown in Fig.2 A, Flag-tagged MBIP co-precipitated with T7-tagged MUK when anti T7-tag antibody was used for immunoprecipitation (lane 4, upper panel); no Flag-MBIP was detectable without T7-MUK overexpression (lane 3,upper panel). When anti-Flag antibody was used for the immunoprecipitation, T7-MUK co-precipitated with Flag-MBIP (Fig.2 B). In contrast, the MBIP binding with Cot, another JNK-activating MAPKKK, was barely detectable (Fig. 2 C). These results indicate a stable and specific interaction between MBIP and MUK in mammalian cells. In the yeast two-hybrid system, the C-terminal half of MBIP binds to part of MUK used for bait (Fig.3 A), indicating that the C-terminal half of MBIP includes a MUK binding site. This is confirmed by the immunoprecipitation experiments using the C-terminal or N-terminal half of MBIP (Fig. 3 A). When T7-MUK was immunoprecipitated, the C-terminal half (amino acids 172–344) but not the N-terminal half (amino acids 1–228) of MBIP was found in the immunocomplex (Fig. 3 B, lanes 10 and12, upper panel). Therefore, the C-terminal half of MBIP including the two leucine-zipper-like motifs is necessary and sufficient for binding with MUK. It should be noted, however, that the binding of MUK to the C-terminal appears to be considerably weaker than the binding to the entire MBIP (Fig. 3 B, lanes 8and 12, upper panel). This indicates that the N-terminal part of MBIP supports MUK binding without being able to bind stably itself. To identify the MBIP binding site on MUK, several MUK deletion mutants were tested for binding to MBIP (Fig.4 A). MBIP can bind to a C-terminal deleted mutant of MUK that retains the two leucine-zipper-like motifs (MUK/1–496), whereas binding is abolished by deletion of one of the two leucine-zipper-like motifs (MUK/1–452) (Fig. 4 B, lanes 9 and 10, upper panel). This indicates that the leucine-zipper-like motifs are essential for MBIP binding. It should also be noted that this leucine-zipper-like motif flanked by 108 amino acids on the C-terminal side was used as bait for screening by the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 4 A). Taken together, these results strongly suggest that MBIP interacts with MUK through the leucine-zipper-like motif. MUK is mostly located in the cytoplasm when overexpressed in COS-1 cells (Fig.5 A), whereas much of the MBIP overexpressed in COS-1 cells is located in the nuclei forming several patch-like structures (Fig. 5 F). The nuclear localization of MBIP is expected from the presence of nuclear localization sequence between the two leucine-zipper-like motifs located in the C-terminal part of MBIP. However, when MBIP was co-expressed with MUK, the nuclear localization was mostly abolished and cytoplasmic localization became apparent (Fig. 5 D). Notably, some MBIP remained in the nuclei cells expressing lower amounts of MUK (arrow in Fig.5 D). Therefore, the cytoplasmic localization of MBIP depends on the amount of MUK, a dependence that may be caused by MUK covering the nuclear localization sequence or by the anchoring of MBIP in cytoplasm by MUK. In any case, this observation strongly supports the idea that the interaction between MUK and MBIP occurs in vivo. To assess the effect of MBIP on the activity of MUK, MUK and JNK1 were transiently overexpressed in 293T cells, and the effect of MBIP co-expression on the activation of JNK1 was tested. As shown in Fig. 6 A, the co-expression of MBIP inhibited the ability of MUK to induce JNK activity as estimated by Western blot analysis using an anti-active JNK antibody (lanes 3–5, uppermost panel). Importantly, the activity of Cot, another JNK-inducing MAPKKK, was not affected by MBIP (Fig. 6 A, lanes 6–8), showing the specificity of MBIP action. The effect of MBIP was further confirmed using SEK1 instead of JNK1 as a reporter of MUK activity. MBIP also inhibited the ability of MUK to induce SEK1 activity as estimated by Western blot analysis using phospho-SEK1 (Thr223) antibody (Fig. 6 B, lanes 3and 4, uppermost panel). Again, no inhibitory effect of MBIP was observed with Cot (Fig. 6 B, lanes 7 and 8, uppermost panel). In addition, it should be noted that the amount of overexpressed MUK as shown by the anti-T7 antibody did not change upon MBIP co-expression (Fig.6 B, lanes 3 and 4, middle panel). Instead, the mobility of MUK on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis increased upon MBIP co-expression. This downward shift of the MUK band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was more clearly observed without SEK1 overexpression (Fig. 6 B, lanes 5 and 6, middle panel). Because treatment of the immunoprecipitated MUK with alkaline phosphatase also caused a similar downward shift of the MUK band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the changes in mobility are likely to depend on the phosphorylation state of MUK (data not shown). Therefore, MBIP may modify the phosphorylation state of MUK in correlation with the change in MUK activity. Taken together, these results show that MBIP is a specific negative regulator of MUK. To test whether the MUK binding domain of MBIP is indispensable for the MUK inhibitory activity, the MBIP deletion mutants tested for MUK binding (Fig. 3) were used in experiments to assess the effect on MUK activity. As shown in Fig. 7, the overexpression of the C-terminal half of MBIP (MBIP-(172–344)), which binds to MUK, inhibits the ability of MUK to activate SEK1 (lanes 4, 7, and 8, uppermost panel). Notable is the complete inhibition of SEK1 phosphorylation by high dose expression of MBIP-(172–344) or the entire MBIP molecule (Fig. 7,lanes 6 and 8). On the other hand, approximately the same dose of the N-terminal part of MBIP (MBIP-(1–228)) produces no such inhibitory effect (Fig. 7, lanes 9 and10). Therefore, both MUK binding and the inhibitory activities lie in the C-terminal half of MBIP. Despite the relatively weak binding activity of MBIP-(172–344) to MUK (Fig. 3), the inhibitory effect is comparable to that of the complete MBIP molecule (Fig. 7, lanes 4–8). This difference may be caused by the more stringent conditions of the immunoprecipitation assay used to test MUK binding (Fig. 3) compared with conditions in vivo used for the MUK inhibition assay (Fig. 7). The specific inhibition of MUK activity by MBIP allowed us to identify the JNK-activating pathway involving MUK by testing the effect of MBIP overexpression on the activation of JNK by different kinds of"
https://openalex.org/W1984884756,"The EBNA1 (for Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1) protein of Epstein-Barr virus governs the replication and partitioning of the viral genomes during latent infection by binding to specific recognition sites in the viral origin of DNA replication. The crystal structure of the DNA binding portion of the EBNA1 protein revealed that this region comprises two structural motifs; a core domain, which mediates protein dimerization and is structurally homologous to the DNA binding domain of the papillomavirus E2 protein, and a flanking domain, which mediated all the observed sequence-specific contacts. To test the possibility that the EBNA1 core domain plays a role in sequence-specific DNA binding not revealed in the crystal structure, we examined the effects of point mutations in potential hydrogen bond donors located in an α-helix of the EBNA1 core domain whose structural homologue in E2 mediates sequence-specific DNA binding. We show that these mutations severely reduce the affinity of EBNA1 for its recognition site, and that the core domain, when expressed in the absence of the flanking domain, has sequence-specific DNA binding activity. Flanking domain residues were also found to contribute to the DNA binding activity of EBNA1. Thus, both the core and flanking domains of EBNA1 play direct roles in DNA recognition.

Epstein-Barr virus base pair(s) electrophoretic mobility shift assay guanidine hydrochloride Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)1 infects most people worldwide and is associated with several types of cancer (1.Kieff E. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 2343-2396Google Scholar). The infection usually takes a latent form in which the viral DNA episomes are replicated once every cell cycle and are maintained at a constant copy number per cell (1.Kieff E. Fields B.N. Knipe D.M. Howley P.M. Fields Virology. 3rd Ed. Lippincott-Raven Publishers, Philadelphia1996: 2343-2396Google Scholar, 2.Yates J.L. DePamphilis M.L. DNA Replication in Eukaryotic Cells. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1996: 751-773Google Scholar). During latent infection, various combinations of as many as nine viral proteins are expressed, but only one viral protein, Epstein-Barr nuclear antigen 1 (EBNA1), is expressed in all cases (3.Klein G. Cell. 1989; 58: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). EBNA1 is the only viral protein required for the replication and stable maintenance of EBV genomes (4.Yates J.L. Warren N. Sugden B. Nature. 1985; 313: 812-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). EBNA1 also regulates the expression of itself and other latent gene products by both transactivating and repressing transcription (5.Reisman D. Sugden B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1986; 6: 3838-3846Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 6.Sample J. Henson E.B.D. Sample C. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 4654-4661Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7.Gahn T. Sugden B. J.

EBNA1 residues that mediate DNA binding and dimerization have been localized to the C-terminal portion of the protein between amino acids 459 and 607 (11.Ambinder R.F. Mullen M. Chang Y. Hayward G.S.

Virology. 1994; 205: 486-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis of this region identified residues 459–487 as important for sequence-specific DNA recognition (13.Chen M.-R.

The crystal structure of the EBNA1 DNA binding and dimerization region was solved both in the presence and absence of its 18-bp recognition site (15.Bochkarev A. Barwell J. Pfuetzner R. Furey W. Edwards A. Frappier L. Cell. 1995; 83: 39-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 16.Bochkarev A. Barwell J. Pfuetzner R. Bochkareva E. Frappier L. Edwards A.M.

Biol. 1998; 284: 1273-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These structures revealed that this region comprised two closely associated domains, referred to as the core domain and the flanking domain (see Fig. 1). The core domain (amino acids 504–604) contains an eight-stranded antiparallel β-barrel, comprised of four strands from each monomer and two α-helices per monomer. The core domain forms the dimerization interface but was not observed to mediate contacts with the DNA bases. The flanking domain (amino acids 461–503) comprises an α-helix and an extended chain, and mediates all of the base contacts observed in the co-crystal structure. The helix is oriented perpendicular to the axis of the DNA and its N-terminal amino acid (Lys477) contacts two bases in the outer portion of the DNA recognition site through the major groove. Five additional base contacts are made by three amino acids (Lys461, Gly463, and Arg469) in a portion of the extended chain that tunnels along the base of the minor groove. Although the EBNA1 co-crystal structure did not reveal a direct role for the core domain in sequence recognition, the core domain is hypothesized to play an important role in DNA binding for several reasons. First, the core domain is structurally homologous (root mean square deviation 0.908 Å) to the complete DNA binding domain of the E2 protein of bovine papillomavirus; this structural homology suggests a common function and DNA binding mechanism. In E2, each monomer contains a helix, termed the recognition helix, which makes all of the base contacts with the DNA (18.Hegde R.S. Grossman S.R. Laimins L.A. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1992; 359: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The analogous helix (also termed the recognition helix) in the EBNA1 core domain contains three amino acids (Lys514, Tyr518, and Arg522) that are potential hydrogen bond donors (15.Bochkarev A. Barwell J. Pfuetzner R. Furey W. Edwards A. Frappier L. Cell. 1995; 83: 39-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Second, the potential hydrogen bond donors in the EBNA1 recognition helix are preferentially conserved in the distantly related EBNA1 protein from herpesvirus papio (19.Yates J.L. Camiolo S.M. Ali S. Ying A. Virology. 1996; 222: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Third, an EBNA1 DNA binding domain mutant lacking most of the flanking domain binds some EBNA1 recognition sites with high affinity, despite the fact that it lacks the residues that mediate five out of the seven base-specific contacts (12.Summers H. Barwell J.A. Pfuetzner R.A. Edwards A.M. Frappier L. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 1228-1231Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, weak DNA binding has been observed with an EBNA1 fragment lacking the complete flanking domain (11.Ambinder R.F. Mullen M. Chang Y. Hayward G.S. Hayward S.D. J. Virol. 1991; 65: 1466-1478Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper we investigated the role of the EBNA1 core domain in DNA binding by mutating potentially important hydrogen bond donors in the core domain and by analyzing the core domain in the absence of the flanking domain. Our data reveal that the core domain plays a direct role in DNA recognition. EBNA1 mutants with alanine substitutions in arginine 469 (R469A), tyrosine 518 (Y518A), arginine 522 (R522A), or lysine 514, tyrosine 518, and arginine 522 (RH) were constructed by amplifying the EBNA1 gene in two fragments; the 3′ end to the mutation site and the mutation site to the 5′ end. The polymerase chain reaction products were phosphorylated and ligated together, and EBNA1 sequences between amino acids 452 and 641 were reamplified using oligonucleotides that placed an NdeI site just N-terminal to residue 452 and a BamHI site C-terminal to residue 641. The polymerase chain reaction products were digested with NdeI andBamHI and cloned between the NdeI andBamHI sites of pET15b (Novagen). The resulting constructs expressed EBNA1 residues 452–641 (with point mutations) fused to a hexahistidine tag. All constructs were sequenced to confirm the positions of the point mutations. The EBNA1 fragment corresponding to amino acids 496–641 was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification using primers that placed anNdeI site prior to codon 496 and a BamHI site following codon 641. The EBNA496–641 expression construct was generated by digesting the amplified EBNA1 fragment withNdeI and BamHI and ligating it between theNdeI and BamHI sites of pET15b. EBNA452–641 was overproduced and purified from Escherichia coli as described previously (20.Barwell J.A. Bochkarev A. Pfuetzner R.A. Tong H. Yang D.S.C. Frappier L. Edwards A.M. J. Biol.

R469A, Y518A, R522A, RH, and EBNA496–641were expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) pLysS and purified on heparin-agarose and metal chelating (nickel) columns as described previously for EBNAWF (21.Summers H. Fleming A. Frappier L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26434-26440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Hexahistidine tags were removed from the purified proteins by thrombin digestion and dialysis as described by Summers et al. (21.Summers H. Fleming A. Frappier L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26434-26440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). For EBNA496–641, following thrombin digestion and dialysis, the protein was passed through the nickel column to remove any EBNA1 protein that still retained the hexahistidine tag. EBNA496–641 in the nickel column flow-through was then concentrated in a Centriprep centrifugal filter unit (Millipore). The concentrations of the purified proteins were determined from absorbance readings at 280 nm. The secondary structures of the EBNA1 proteins were compared using an Aviv 62A DS circular dichroism spectrometer. A 10 μm solution of each protein in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, was scanned from 320 to 200 nm at 25 °C in a 0.1-cm cuvette using a 1-s averaging time. For protein stability studies, concentrated protein samples were rapidly diluted into guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl; Pierce) buffer, and the loss of circular dichroism (CD) signal over time was monitored at 222 nm, beginning 5–10 s after dilution into GdnHCl. The raw data were normalized and fit to the equation y = 1 − exp(−kt) using the Kaleidograph program. DNA binding assays used a single EBNA1 recognition site corresponding to site 1 of the oriP dyad symmetry element. To generate this site, the 20-mer oligonucleotide 5′-CGGGAAGCATATGCTACCCG-3′ was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and then annealed to its complementary oligonucleotide. For equilibrium binding assays, EBNA1 proteins were incubated with 10 fmol of end-labeled DNA recognition site for 10 min at room temperature in 20-μl reactions containing 10 mmHEPES (pH 7.5), 5 mm MgCl2, 300 mmNaCl (binding buffer). Glycerol was then added to a final concentration of 5%, and the reactions were loaded onto a 12% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5× TBE. After electrophoresis, bound and unbound DNA was visualized by autoradiography and quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and Imagequant software. The ability of EBNA496–641 to bind to the recognition site of the papillomavirus E2 protein was also tested as described above for the EBNA1 recognition site. The E2 recognition site was generated by annealing the end-labeled, palindromic 18-mer 5′-CCGACCGACGTCGGTCGG-3′ to itself. The EBNA1 core domain contains a helix that is structurally homologous to the “recognition helix” in E2. In E2, this helix harbors all of the residues that make base-specific contacts with the DNA. To investigate the role of the EBNA1 recognition helix, we generated three different EBNA1 mutants in which potential hydrogen bond donors of the recognition helix were mutated to alanines (see Fig.1). In one mutant, called RH, all three potential hydrogen bond donors were disrupted (Lys514, Tyr518, and Arg522); in the second mutant, tyrosine 518 was targeted (Y518A); and the third mutant contained a point mutation in arginine 522 (R522A). In the EBNA-DNA co-crystal structure, the three targeted amino acids are oriented toward the DNA but are too far from the nearest H-bond acceptor in the bases (more than 6 Å) to form H-bonds (16.Bochkarev A. Barwell J. Pfuetzner R. Bochkareva E. Frappier L. Edwards A.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 791-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Arg522 does, however, form a H-bond with one phosphate residue. All three mutations were introduced in the context of the DNA binding and dimerization region (amino acids 452–641), purified, and titrated onto an EBNA1 recognition site (Fig. 2and Table I). The DNA binding activity of each mutant, as analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs), was compared with the equivalent wild type EBNA1 polypeptide (EBNA452–641). All of the mutant proteins showed defects in DNA binding. The triple mutant and R522A had severely diminished EBNA1 DNA binding activity, and the activity of the Y518A mutant was reduced 80-fold compared with the wild type polypeptide. These experiments were performed three times for each mutant with very similar results.Table IDissociation constants of EBNA1 proteins on the EBNA1 recognition siteProteinK d aDissociation constants were calculated from single representative experiments.nmEBNA452–6411RHNDbDNA binding activity was too low to detect in our assay.Y518A80R522A1600R469A300EBNA496–641800a Dissociation constants were calculated from single representative experiments.b DNA binding activity was too low to detect in our assay. Open table in a new tab To ensure that the mutations in the recognition helix affected DNA binding specifically rather than disrupted the folding of the protein, we tested the effects of the mutations on protein folding using CD spectroscopy. The CD spectra of the three recognition helix mutants were indistinguishable from the wild type polypeptide (Fig.3). All four proteins had elliptical minima at 208 and 222 nm, in keeping with their helical content. We also tested whether the recognition helix mutations were less active because they destabilized the EBNA1 dimer. The active form of EBNA1 is a dimer, and the dimerization interface is highly similar to the E2 protein from papillomavirus (15.Bochkarev A. Barwell J. Pfuetzner R. Furey W. Edwards A. Frappier L.

In E2, dissociation of the dimer leads to rapid unfolding and inactivation (23.Mok Y. Bycroft M. de Prat-Gay G. Nat. Struct.

To test the effects of the recognition helix mutations on the stability of the EBNA1 dimer, we monitored the rates of unfolding of the EBNA1 proteins in guanidine using circular dichroism at 222 nm (TableII). EBNA452–641 was extremely stable, requiring a 33-min incubation in 6.6 mGdnHCl to unfold half of the protein (standard equilibrium stability assays were not possible because the unfolding of EBNA452–641 was not reversible). The Y518A mutation had no significant effect on the stability of the protein. The triple point mutation had only a small effect on EBNA1 stability, with half of the protein remaining folded after 14 min in 6.6 m guanidine. Our data suggest that all of the EBNA1 mutants remained dimeric and folded during the 10-min DNA binding reaction (in the absence of guanidine). Our results therefore support a direct role for the EBNA1 recognition helix in DNA recognition.Table IISummary of protein unfolding experiments in 6.6 m guanidineProteinkaThe unfolding rate constant.t1/2bTime required for half of the protein to unfold.1/sminEBNA452–6415.0 × 10−433Y518A5.7 × 10−429RH1.2 × 10−314a The unfolding rate constant.b Time required for half of the protein to unfold. Open table in a new tab The above data strongly suggest that the core domain recognition helices play a direct role in DNA recognition, but alternative explanations are possible. For example, the recognition helix mutations could have elicited their effects by causing minor structural changes that would not be detected by CD analysis or by disrupting DNA phosphate (as opposed to base) interactions. To directly examine the contribution of the core domain to DNA binding, we expressed and purified an EBNA1 polypeptide containing the core domain but lacking the flanking domain (EBNA496–641), and monitored sequence-specific DNA binding by EMSAs. Like the EBNA1 proteins examined above, EBNA496–641 contained the C-terminal acidic tail in addition to DNA binding domain residues (the EBNA1 core domain produced in the absence of the acidic tail was insoluble). Purified EBNA496–641 protein was titrated onto two different DNA fragments, one that contained the EBNA1 binding site and a second 18-bp sequence that contained the DNA recognition site for the E2 protein of bovine papillomavirus. As shown in Fig.4, EBNA496–641 bound to the EBNA1 site in a saturable manner but not to the E2 site. Thus, the core domain is capable of sequence-specific DNA binding in the absence of the flanking domain. The complex formed by EBNA496–641 and the EBNA1 recognition site was consistently observed to migrate in the gel as a doublet, possibly reflecting variations in the conformation of the bound DNA. The affinity of EBNA496–641 for the EBNA1 site was approximately 800-fold less than that observed for EBNA452–641 (Table I). The crystal structure of EBNA1 bound to DNA showed that all base contacts were made by flanking domain residues, whereas the current EMSA data indicate that the core domain plays a major role in base recognition. These differences indicate either: 1) that EBNA1 has two independent modes of DNA recognition, the flanking domain mode that occurs under the crystallography conditions and the core domain mode that occurs in the EMSAs, or 2) that both the core and flanking domains contribute to DNA binding but that the core domain base contacts are transient and therefore not observed in the crystal structure. To distinguish between these two possibilities, it was important to determine whether flanking domain residues, in the context of the entire DNA binding region, contributed to the DNA binding activity detected by EMSAs. The reduced DNA binding affinity of EBNA496–641 relative to EBNA452–641 suggested that the flanking domain was contributing to DNA binding but could conceivably be due to a reduction in the percentage of the protein that is folded. To determine the contribution of the flanking domain to DNA binding activity of EBNA452–641, we mutated arginine 469 to alanine within the context of amino acids 452–641 (R469A). In the EBNA1 co-crystal structure, arginine 469 makes two base contacts and is located in the extended chain that sits in the DNA minor groove (16.Bochkarev A. Barwell J. Pfuetzner R. Bochkareva E. Frappier L. Edwards A.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 791-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). R469A was expressed, purified, and assayed for binding to the EBNA1 recognition site exactly as performed with the recognition helix mutants. As shown in Fig. 5 and Table I, the mutation of R469 reduced DNA binding activity approximately 300-fold. As was observed for EBNA496–641, the DNA complex formed by R469A migrated as a doublet. The crystal structure of the EBNA1 DNA binding region bound to DNA revealed two domains: the core domain, which mediated dimerization, and the flanking domain, which mediated base contacts with the DNA (16.Bochkarev A. Barwell J. Pfuetzner R. Bochkareva E. Frappier L. Edwards A.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 791-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). We have now shown that the core domain also plays a direct role in sequence-specific DNA interactions via two α-helices termed the recognition helices. We envisage three possible ways in which the biochemical and structural data on the EBNA1-DNA interaction can be reconciled. First, EBNA1 may have two different modes of DNA binding: one that involves the flanking domain and a second that uses the core domain. In this scenario, the flanking domain binding mode would be favored under the conditions of the crystallography, whereas the core domain binding mode would be favored under the conditions of the binding reactions for the EMSAs. This explanation is unlikely because point mutations both in the core domain recognition helices and in the flanking domain extended chain have pronounced effects on DNA binding under the conditions of the EMSAs. Furthermore, the crystal structure of the EBNA1 DNA binding region has been solved on three different EBNA1 recognition sequences (including the site 1 sequence studied here) under varied salt and buffer conditions and, in all cases, the hydrogen bonds observed between EBNA1 residues and the DNA bases were identical (16.Bochkarev A. Barwell J. Pfuetzner R. Bochkareva E. Frappier L. Edwards A.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 791-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 17.Bochkarev A. Bochkareva E. Frappier L. Edwards A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 284: 1273-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). 2A. Bochkarev, A. M. Edwards, and L. Frappier, unpublished results. A second explanation is that both the core and flanking domains mediate DNA contacts under the EMSA and crystallography conditions, but that the recognition helices are dynamically associated with the DNA. In this case, the crystal structure might simply have captured the recognition helices in the dissociated position. Based on the co-crystal structures of EBNA1 and E2, the base contacts made by the EBNA1 recognition helices are expected to occur through the major groove. The possibility that the core and flanking domains contact the DNA at the same time is supported by methylation protection footprints that show protection of a G residue (at position 3/−3 relative to the axis of symmetry of the palindrome) that is not contacted by flanking domain residues in the crystal structure but is predicted to be contacted by Lys514 in the recognition helix (16.Bochkarev A. Barwell J. Pfuetzner R. Bochkareva E. Frappier L. Edwards A.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 791-800Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 25.Frappier L. O'Donnell M. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 1786-1790Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The third possibility is that EBNA1 binds DNA by a two-step mechanism in which both the core and flanking domains interact sequentially with the EBNA1 recognition site. In this mechanism, the core domain recognition helices would make the first sequence-specific DNA contacts, positioning the protein such that the flanking domain extended chain can be loaded into the minor groove. After the flanking domain is assembled on the DNA, the position of the recognition helices would shift such that direct contacts with the bases are no longer stable. Thus, in the assembled EBNA1-DNA complex that was crystallized, no base contacts with the core domain would be observed. During dissociation of EBNA1 from the DNA, the recognition helices might again make transient DNA contacts, facilitating the release of the flanking domain from the DNA. A key feature of models two and three is that the recognition helices and the flanking domain extended chain are flexible. Evidence for the former comes from NMR studies on the E2 DNA binding domain, which revealed that the E2 recognition helices are mobile (26.Liang H. Petros A.M. Meadows R.P. Yoon H.S. Egan D.A. Walter K. Holzman T.F. Robbins T. Fesik S.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2095-2103Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The flexibility of the EBNA1 flanking domain extended chain was revealed in the crystal structure of EBNA470–607 in the absence of DNA (15.Bochkarev A. Barwell J. Pfuetzner R. Furey W. Edwards A. Frappier L. Cell. 1995; 83: 39-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). In this structure, the extended chains in the two monomers were disordered. Thus, DNA binding models two or three are likely, and further kinetic analyses will be necessary to differentiate between the two. Since EBNA1 dimerization is a requirement for DNA binding, we have addressed the possibility that the recognition helix mutations affect DNA binding indirectly by destabilizing the dimerization of the protein. In these experiments, we used protein unfolding as a measure of disruption of the dimerization interface. Several lines of evidence indicate that unfolding will occur if the dimerization of EBNA1 is disrupted. First, the EBNA1 core domain that mediates dimerization is almost identical in structure to the DNA binding and dimerization domain of the papillomavirus E2 protein. Careful studies on the folding of E2 have clearly shown that dissociation of the dimer only occurs when the domain unfolds (23.Mok Y. Bycroft M. de Prat-Gay G. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 24.Mok Y. de Prat-Gay G. Butler P.J. Bycroft M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Second, the recognition helix point mutations are distant from the residues in the four β-sheets known to mediate dimerization, and therefore any effects on dimerization would be expected to involve destabilization of the domain (15.Bochkarev A. Barwell J. Pfuetzner R. Furey W. Edwards A. Frappier L. Cell. 1995; 83: 39-46Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Third, EBNA1 is only found as a dimer under native conditions; folded monomers of EBNA1 have never been observed (10.Frappier L. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7819-7826Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Finally, the dimeric interface forms the hydrophobic core of the domain and, thus, folding of an EBNA1 monomer is energetically very unlikely. We believe, therefore, that the defect associated with the EBNA1 recognition helix mutations is in DNA binding and not in dimerization. One caveat to our EBNA1 dimerization analysis was that the CD experiments were only conducted at one protein concentration (10 μm); therefore, we have not ruled out the possibility that the EBNA1 dimers dissociate at lower protein concentrations. However, the DNA binding analyses of the RH and R522A mutants were conducted at protein concentrations similar to those used in the CD analysis (up to 26 μm for RH and up to 6 μm for R522A); therefore, the DNA binding defects exhibited by these mutants are unlikely to be due to disruption of dimerization. DNA binding mechanisms involving two DNA interaction modes or steps are unusual but not completely novel. For example, the Myb oncoprotein and T7 and E. coli RNA polymerases have some dynamic characteristics. Tryptophan fluorescence studies indicate that the initial rapid interaction of Myb with DNA is followed by a slower step, which involves a structural reorganization of the protein (27.Zargarian L. Le Tilly V. Jamin N. Chaffotte A. Gabrielsen O.S. Toma F. Alpert B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1921-1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Similarly, kinetic studies with T7 RNA polymerase indicate that this protein forms an initial weak complex with promoter DNA, then undergoes a conformational changes resulting in tighter DNA binding (28.Jia Y. Kumar A. Patel S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30451-30458Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The multisubunit E. coli RNA polymerase has at least two biochemically defined nucleic acid binding domains that interact transiently during the course of the polymerization reaction and stabilize the ternary elongation complex (29.Chamberlin M.J. Harvey Lect. 1992; 88: 1-21PubMed Google Scholar, 30.Johnson T.L. Chamberlin M.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 217-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 31.Nudler E. Avetissova E. Markovtsov V. Goldfarb A. Science. 1996; 273: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar); the dynamic nature of these interactions underlies the regulation of RNA synthesis. Perhaps the dynamics of the interaction of the EBNA1 domains with DNA also plays a regulatory role in the initiation of DNA replication.

Induction is critical for further development since the metanephric blastema is destined to die (programmed cell death) unless it is rescued by inducers (1Koseki C. Herzlinger D. Al-Awqati Q. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Induced cells are then selected for further proliferation and differentiation. The ureteric bud is, in turn, induced to branch by the mesenchyme to form the collecting system of the kidney including the cortical collecting tubules. Critical to epithelial branching are the signals provided by the mesenchyme. Localized production of glial-derived neurotrophic factor by the mesenchyme signals its receptorret on the ureteric bud tip to branch (2Durbec P. Marcos-Gutierrez C.V. Kikenny C. Grigoriou M. Wartiowaara K. Suvanto P. Smith D. Ponder B. Costantini F. Saarma M. Sariola H. Pachnis V. Nature. 1996; 381: 789-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). The mesenchyme forms the epithelial cells of the rest of the nephron. As contact is established between these two cell types, a complex transformation occurs whereby the mesenchymal cells undergo conversion into an epithelial type, which later differentiate and segment into the various components of the nephron (3Herzlinger D. Koseki C. Mikawa T. Al-Awqati Q. Development. 1992; 114: 565-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Cell to cell and cell to matrix interactions are critical for almost every stage of these complex morphogenetic programs. Among the mediators of these interactions are growth factors and their receptors (4Coles S.R. Burne J.F. Raff M.C. Development. 1993; 118: 777-784PubMed Google Scholar), receptors for extracellular matrix molecules such as integrins (5Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), and cell adhesion molecules such as the cadherins (6Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2913) Google Scholar). Cadherins are classically defined by their calcium-dependant homophilic cell adhesion properties. In addition to responding to signaling events, cadherins transduce signals into the cell (7Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). The differential expression of cadherins may drive nephrogenesis by stimulating aggregation by subsets of cells expressing the same type of cadherin (8Choe E.A. Patterson L.T. Brookhiser W.T Mah S. Kinter C. Dressler G. Development. 1998; 125: 803-812PubMed Google Scholar).To identify novel cell surface molecules critical for nephrogenesis, we generated a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAb)1 to embryonic day 15 (E15) rat kidneys. The immunization protocol ensured that all molecules identified are authentic embryonic kidney molecules. Developmentally significant mAbs were selected based on their pattern of expression and/or their ability to inhibit tubulogenesis in vitro. Several of the antibodies disrupted development in vitro, suggesting that their antigens are necessary for development, at least in the organ culture system. One mAb, 3D2-E9, inhibited tubulogenesis by producing widespread apoptosis in induced mesenchymal cells (9Goldberg M. Barasch J. Shifteh A. D'Agati V. Oliver J.A. Al-Awqati Q. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F79-F86PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, this antibody also inhibited pulmonary branching and caused cylindrical dilatation of the proximal airways in lung organ culture, suggesting that its antigen might play a more general role in branching morphogenesis (10Goldberg M.R.. Peshkovsky C. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 157 (Abstr. 3): 543Google Scholar). The 3D2-E9 mAb recognized a disulfide-linked integral membrane glycoprotein whose molecular mass was 100 kDa under reducing conditions. We present here the purification and cloning of the cDNA of its antigen. This novel protein is an integral membrane protein whose extracellular domain contains four sequences homologous to calcium-dependent binding motifs of the cadherin superfamily. In addition, a 31-amino acid threonine, serine, and proline (TSP)-rich tandemly repeated motif similar to mucin domains is contained within its longer isoform. We have termed this novel cell adhesion molecule μ-protocadherin to reflect the mucin-type repeat contained within its longer isoform. Transfection of μ-protocadherin in L929 cells mediated aggregation, confirming its role in intercellular adhesion. Thus, μ-protocadherin represents a new receptor capable of mediating signals during branching morphogenesis.DISCUSSIONThe cadherin superfamily contains several members that include the original family, now termed classical cadherins, that are defined by their calcium-dependent homophilic cell adhesion properties. Their cytoplasmic region binds β-catenin and is linked to the actin cytoskeleton through α-catenin and actinin (7Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). A related family of cadherin-like molecules, the protocadherins is expressed in the brain and are implicated in synaptic junction adhesive interactions (20Wu Q. Maniatis T. Cell. 1999; 97: 779-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 26Kohmura N. Senzaki K. Hamada S. Kai N. Yasuda R. Watanabe M. Ishi H. Yasuda M. Mishina M. Yagi T. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1137-1151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that a wide variety of such proteins could be generated by alternate splicing and recombination, since the genomic sequences of protocadherins are organized in three closely linked clusters that contain variable extracellular domains but a conserved cytoplasmic region (20Wu Q. Maniatis T. Cell. 1999; 97: 779-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Analysis of μ-protocadherin sequence reveals several structural features present in the protocadherin superfamily. μ-Protocadherin contains in its first cadherin ectodomain an RGD peptide similar to protocadherins-α. Furthermore, the first repeat does not contain an HAV sequence felt to be responsible for the homophilic binding properties of the classical cadherins. However, both LI-cadherin and the protocadherins can mediate homotypic interactions without the HAV domain. The μ-protocadherin cytoplasmic region contains four putative SH3 binding domains, whereas that of protocadherin-α contains six. The cytoplasmic region of μ-protocadherin terminates with a type I PDZ binding domain, similar to the C-terminal end of rat fat protocadherin (23Ponassi M. Jacques T.S. Ciani L. ffrench-Constant C. Mech. Dev. 1999; 80: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). InC. elegans, this motif at the C terminus of the epidermal growth factor receptor homologue is responsible for preferential localization to the basolateral membrane (24Kaech S.M. Whitfield C.W. Kim S.K. Cell. 1998; 94: 761-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Thus, this sequence may be responsible for the targeting of μ-protocadherin to the basolateral membrane during kidney development.Genomic analysis of the protocadherin family members revealed that the extracellular cadherin repeats were encoded by a single exon (20Wu Q. Maniatis T. Cell. 1999; 97: 779-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Preliminary genomic analysis, however, revealed that μ-protocadherin contained several exons coding for its extracellular region. A unique feature of μ-protocadherin is that it contains TSP-rich mucin-like repeats in its extracellular domain (27Spicer A.P. Parry G. Patton S. Gendler S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15099-15109Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that high levels of mucin production were associated with the decreased adhesive properties of carcinoma cells (28Ligtenberg M. Buijs J.L. Vos F. Hilkens J. Cancer Res. 1992; 52: 2318-2324PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, transfection of MUC1 into certain cells interferes with cadherin-mediated cellular aggregation (29Wesseling J. van der valk S.W. Hilkens J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 565-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The length of the extracellular MUC1 repeats was found to be the dominant factor determining the extent of inhibition (22Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chisti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar). Alternatively, mucins may compete for cytosolic regulators, since cell adhesive interactions are a necessary step for Muc1 to bind to β-catenin (30Yamamoto M. Bharti A. Li Y. Kufe D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12492-12494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). These studies raise the possibility that the adhesive properties of μ-protocadherin may be regulated by the presence of the mucin repeats.The longer isoform of μ-protocadherin containing the mucin repeat is differentially expressed during the perinatal period. This highlights the probable different function of each isoform. An instructive comparison can be made to another adhesive molecule, the mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1), which contains immunoglobulin (Ig)-like as well as mucin domains. Two isoforms were described; in one, the mucin domains were alternatively spliced out (31Leung E. Greene J. Ni J. Raymond L.G. Lehnert K. Langley R. Krissansen G.W. Immunol. Cell Biol. 1996; 74: 490-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). MAdCAM-1 purified from mesenteric lymph nodes can support the rolling of lymphocytes under shear through its binding to L-selectin (32Berg E.L. McEvoy L.M. Berlin C. Bargatze R.F. Butcher E.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 695-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Hence, the selectin binding carbohydrate determinants of the mucin domains were postulated to play an important role in allowing movement and plasticity of cells while still permitting adhesion to occur. An analogous situation may be the requirement of epithelial cells to migrate during branching morphogenesis, yet still remain adherent to one another. This might explain how the 3D2-E9 mAb, which binds to a carbohydrate determinant, can disrupt branching morphogenesis.Dynamic changes in cell adhesion participate in the generation of three-dimensional structures during development. These adhesion mechanisms are highly regulated and are integrated with the processes of changes in cell shape and cell migration. Differential expression of the cadherins can drive morphogenesis by stimulating aggregation of subsets of cells expressing the same type of cadherin. During nephrogenesis, for example, cadherin-11 is expressed primarily in mesenchymal cells, whereas the newly formed epithelium of the renal vesicle expresses E-cadherin near the ureteric bud tips and cadherin-6 elsewhere. As the S-shaped tubules develop, proximal tubule progenitors express cadherin-6, whereas distal tubule cells express E-cadherin and glomeruli express P-cadherin (8Choe E.A. Patterson L.T. Brookhiser W.T Mah S. Kinter C. Dressler G. Development. 1998; 125: 803-812PubMed Google Scholar). It would therefore be important to examine whether the expression of the two forms of μ-protocadherin change during kidney and lung development.In addition to responding to signaling events, cell adhesion molecules themselves transduce signals into the cell. Adding to the complexity, these adhesive interactions often must be in a dynamic state to achieve the movements of cells with respect to the matrix and to one another. Cell adhesion molecules such as the cadherins also participate in signaling pathways that control developmental patterning in embryos (for review see Ref. 6Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2913) Google Scholar). As an example, β-catenin is an essential component of the WNT signaling pathway. In Xenopus embryos, β-catenin mediates a signaling pathway that controls dorsal-ventral and anterior posterior body axes patterning. μ-Protocadherin was shown to colocalize by immunofluorescence to β-catenin, primarily at the junction of the basal and lateral membrane, although isoform-specific expression may be more revealing.That modulation of μ-protocadherin signaling by the 3D2-E9 antibody led to apoptosis, and disrupted tubulogenesis in both kidney and lung suggests that this protein is critically involved in these processes. Disruption of cell to cell and cell to matrix interactions induces apoptosis (25Ruoslahti E. Reed J.C. Cell. 1994; 77: 477-478Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (970) Google Scholar). In human bronchiolar epithelial cells grown in vitro, an antibody to the αV integrin induced apoptosis (33Aoshiba K. Rennard S.I. Spurzem J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: L28-L37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Interestingly, apoptosis was also prevented by allowing the epithelial cells to aggregate with each other. Thus, the apoptotic pathway may regulate three-dimensional structure formation by ensuring that aberrant structural and functional units are removed (1Koseki C. Herzlinger D. Al-Awqati Q. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 4Coles S.R. Burne J.F. Raff M.C. Development. 1993; 118: 777-784PubMed Google Scholar). μ-Protocadherin could mediate such morphometric information into the apoptotic pathway. The mature mammalian kidney develops when an outgrowth of the wolffian duct, the ureteric bud, induces the metanephric mesenchyme to differentiate into the nephron. Induction is critical for further development since the metanephric blastema is destined to die (programmed cell death) unless it is rescued by inducers (1Koseki C. Herzlinger D. Al-Awqati Q. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1327-1333Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Induced cells are then selected for further proliferation and differentiation. The ureteric bud is, in turn, induced to branch by the mesenchyme to form the collecting system of the kidney including the cortical collecting tubules. Critical to epithelial branching are the signals provided by the mesenchyme. Localized production of glial-derived neurotrophic factor by the mesenchyme signals its receptorret on the ureteric bud tip to branch (2Durbec P. Marcos-Gutierrez C.V. Kikenny C. Grigoriou M. Wartiowaara K. Suvanto P. Smith D. Ponder B. Costantini F. Saarma M. Sariola H. Pachnis V. Nature. 1996; 381: 789-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (725) Google Scholar). The mesenchyme forms the epithelial cells of the rest of the nephron. As contact is established between these two cell types, a complex transformation occurs whereby the mesenchymal cells undergo conversion into an epithelial type, which later differentiate and segment into the various components of the nephron (3Herzlinger D. Koseki C. Mikawa T. Al-Awqati Q. Development. 1992; 114: 565-572Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell to cell and cell to matrix interactions are critical for almost every stage of these complex morphogenetic programs. Among the mediators of these interactions are growth factors and their receptors (4Coles S.R. Burne J.F. Raff M.C. Development. 1993; 118: 777-784PubMed Google Scholar), receptors for extracellular matrix molecules such as integrins (5Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 705-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), and cell adhesion molecules such as the cadherins (6Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2913) Google Scholar). Cadherins are classically defined by their calcium-dependant homophilic cell adhesion properties. In addition to responding to signaling events, cadherins transduce signals into the cell (7Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). The differential expression of cadherins may drive nephrogenesis by stimulating aggregation by subsets of cells expressing the same type of cadherin (8Choe E.A. Patterson L.T. Brookhiser W.T Mah S. Kinter C. Dressler G. Development. 1998; 125: 803-812PubMed Google Scholar). To identify novel cell surface molecules critical for nephrogenesis, we generated a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAb)1 to embryonic day 15 (E15) rat kidneys. The immunization protocol ensured that all molecules identified are authentic embryonic kidney molecules. Developmentally significant mAbs were selected based on their pattern of expression and/or their ability to inhibit tubulogenesis in vitro. Several of the antibodies disrupted development in vitro, suggesting that their antigens are necessary for development, at least in the organ culture system. One mAb, 3D2-E9, inhibited tubulogenesis by producing widespread apoptosis in induced mesenchymal cells (9Goldberg M. Barasch J. Shifteh A. D'Agati V. Oliver J.A. Al-Awqati Q. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: F79-F86PubMed Google Scholar). Remarkably, this antibody also inhibited pulmonary branching and caused cylindrical dilatation of the proximal airways in lung organ culture, suggesting that its antigen might play a more general role in branching morphogenesis (10Goldberg M.R.. Peshkovsky C. Am. J. Respir. Crit. Care Med. 1998; 157 (Abstr. 3): 543Google Scholar). The 3D2-E9 mAb recognized a disulfide-linked integral membrane glycoprotein whose molecular mass was 100 kDa under reducing conditions. We present here the purification and cloning of the cDNA of its antigen. This novel protein is an integral membrane protein whose extracellular domain contains four sequences homologous to calcium-dependent binding motifs of the cadherin superfamily. In addition, a 31-amino acid threonine, serine, and proline (TSP)-rich tandemly repeated motif similar to mucin domains is contained within its longer isoform. We have termed this novel cell adhesion molecule μ-protocadherin to reflect the mucin-type repeat contained within its longer isoform. Transfection of μ-protocadherin in L929 cells mediated aggregation, confirming its role in intercellular adhesion. Thus, μ-protocadherin represents a new receptor capable of mediating signals during branching morphogenesis. DISCUSSIONThe cadherin superfamily contains several members that include the original family, now termed classical cadherins, that are defined by their calcium-dependent homophilic cell adhesion properties. Their cytoplasmic region binds β-catenin and is linked to the actin cytoskeleton through α-catenin and actinin (7Yap A.S. Brieher W.M. Gumbiner B.M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 119-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (685) Google Scholar). A related family of cadherin-like molecules, the protocadherins is expressed in the brain and are implicated in synaptic junction adhesive interactions (20Wu Q. Maniatis T. Cell. 1999; 97: 779-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar, 26Kohmura N. Senzaki K. Hamada S. Kai N. Yasuda R. Watanabe M. Ishi H. Yasuda M. Mishina M. Yagi T. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1137-1151Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that a wide variety of such proteins could be generated by alternate splicing and recombination, since the genomic sequences of protocadherins are organized in three closely linked clusters that contain variable extracellular domains but a conserved cytoplasmic region (20Wu Q. Maniatis T. Cell. 1999; 97: 779-790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Analysis of μ-protocadherin sequence reveals several structural features present in the protocadherin superfamily. μ-Protocadherin contains in its first cadherin ectodomain an RGD peptide similar to protocadherins-α. Furthermore, the first repeat does not contain an HAV sequence felt to be responsible for the homophilic binding properties of the classical cadherins. However, both LI-cadherin and the protocadherins can mediate homotypic interactions without the HAV domain. The μ-protocadherin cytoplasmic region contains four putative SH3 binding domains, whereas that of protocadherin-α contains six. The cytoplasmic region of μ-protocadherin terminates with a type I PDZ binding domain, similar to the C-terminal end of rat fat protocadherin (23Ponassi M. Jacques T.S. Ciani L. ffrench-Constant C. Mech. Dev. 1999; 80: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). InC. elegans, this motif at the C terminus of the epidermal growth factor receptor homologue is responsible for preferential localization to the basolateral membrane (24Kaech S.M. Whitfield C.W.

In this study, we have isolated a mouse cDNA encoding a protein kinase homologous to Nck-interacting kinase (NIK), a member of the group I germinal center kinase family. This protein kinase is expressed during the late stages of embryogenesis, but not in adult tissues, and thus named NESK (NIK-likeembryo-specific kinase). NESK selectively activated the JNK pathway when overexpressed in HEK 293 cells but did not stimulate the p38 kinase or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways. NESK-induced JNK activation was inhibited by the dominant negative mutants of MEKK1 and MKK4. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α or TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) stimulated the NESK activity. Furthermore, the dominant negative NESK mutant inhibited the JNK activation induced by TNF-α or TRAF2. These results suggest that NESK, a novel activator of the JNK pathway, functions in coupling TRAF2 to the MEKK1 → MKK4 → JNK kinase cascade during the late stages of mammalian embryogenesis.

The JNK activation by group I GCKs such as GCK and GCK-like kinase is mediated through the MEKK1 and MKK4 kinase cascade (5.Diener K. Wang X.S. Chen C. Meyer C.F. Keesler G. Zukowski M. Tan T.-H.

NIK and TRAF2- and Nck-interacting kinase interact with the Src homology 2-Src homology 3 domain-containing adapter protein Nck and have been proposed to link protein tyrosine kinase signals to the JNK activation (8.Su Y.-C. Han J. Xu S. Cobb M. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 13.Fu C.A. Shen M. Huang B.C.B. Lasaga J. Payan D.G. Luo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30729-30737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).The Drosophila Misshapen and C. elegans Mig-15 proteins are highly homologous to mammalian NIK, both within and outside of the kinase domain (19.Su Y.-C. Treisman J.E. Skolnik E.Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The Misshapen protein functions upstream of basket, the Drosophila homologue of JNK, and hemipterous, a homologue of MKK7, to stimulate dorsal closure in the Drosophila embryo (19.Su Y.-C. Treisman J.E. Skolnik E.Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Dorsal closure occurs during the later stages in Drosophila embryogenesis and involves cell migrations and shape changes that position and fuse the lateral epidermal primordia over the aminoserosa. TheDrosophila TRAF binds Misshapen in vitro, and coexpression of Misshapen and Drosophila TRAF leads to the synergistic activation of JNK (20.Liu H. Su Y.-C. Becker E. Treisman J. Skolnik E.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 101-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The C. elegans Mig-15 is necessary for several developmental processes in C. elegans. mig-15 mutants have a variety of developmental defects including defects in Q-neuroblast migration and muscle arm targeting (19.Su Y.-C. Treisman J.E. Skolnik E.Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, GCKs may be responsible for some of the developmental processes in mammals.We report here a novel mammalian group I GCK family kinase isolated from mouse embryo by a PCR-based screen for cDNA clones of protein kinases. It is expressed during the late stages of mouse embryogenesis, but not in various adult tissues, and has the highest homology to NIK. Thus, this newly identified kinase was designated NESK (NIK-like embryo-specifickinase). We demonstrate in this report that NESK, like other group I GCK family members, can selectively activate the JNK pathway when overexpressed in HEK 293 cells. Furthermore, dominant negative forms of MEKK1 and MKK4 inhibited the NESK-induced JNK activation, and a dominant negative NESK mutant inhibited TRAF2-induced JNK activation, suggesting that NESK functions downstream of TRAF2 and upstream of MEKK1 and MKK4 in the JNK signaling pathway.DISCUSSIONIn this study, we identified a novel protein kinase, NESK, from mouse embryo. NESK shares high sequence homology with members of the group I GCK family in both the N-terminal kinase domain and the C-terminal putative regulatory domain. All members of the group I GCK family selectively activate the JNK pathway when overexpressed in cultured cells but do not stimulate the p38 kinase or ERK signaling pathways (1.Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5259-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). NESK also activates the JNK pathway when overexpressed in HEK 293 cells but does not activate the p38 kinase or ERK pathways. Based on these structural and functional properties, it can be concluded that NESK is a novel member of the group I GCK family.NESK mRNA is expressed exclusively during the late stages of mouse embryogenesis. Further, NESK is highly homologous to theDrosophila Misshapen and C. elegans Mig-15 proteins, both in the kinase domain and in the C-terminal regulatory domain. The Misshapen protein functions upstream of the JNK pathway to stimulate dorsal closure in the Drosophila embryo (19.Su Y.-C. Treisman J.E. Skolnik E.Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Dorsal closure occurs during the late stages of Drosophilaembryogenesis. The Mig-15 protein is necessary for several developmental processes in C. elegans (19.Su Y.-C. Treisman J.E. Skolnik E.Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, NESK is suggested to function as an intracellular signaling molecule in a developmental process during the late stages of mammalian embryogenesis. More recently, a novel member of the group I GCK family, named NRK, was cloned from mouse embryo (26.Kanai-Azuma M. Kanai Y. Okamoto M. Hayashi Y. Yonekawa H. Yazaki K. Mech. Dev. 1999; 89: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). NESK is 99% identical to NRK. Moreover, the expression pattern of NESK mRNA is similar to that of NRK mRNA. Thus, although the role of NRK in the JNK pathway has not been determined, NESK is probably the same protein as NRK.In situ hybridization revealed that NRK was predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle during the late stages in mouse embryogenesis (26.Kanai-Azuma M. Kanai Y. Okamoto M. Hayashi Y. Yonekawa H. Yazaki K. Mech. Dev. 1999; 89: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Dorsal closure in Drosophilaembryogenesis involves cell migrations. mig-15 mutants have developmental defects in Q-neuroblast migration and muscle arm targeting. Thus, NESK may participate in intracellular signaling involved in muscle cell migration.It has been shown that the dominant negative mutant of MEKK1 inhibited GCK-, NIK-, GCK-like kinase-, or GCK-related kinase-induced JNK activation (5.Diener K. Wang X.S. Chen C. Meyer C.F. Keesler G. Zukowski M. Tan T.-H. Yao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9687-9692Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 7.Shi C.-S. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22681-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Hematopoietic progenitor kinase/GCK-like kinase-induced JNK activation has been shown to be inhibited by the dominant negative mutant of TAK1 but not by that of MEKK1(11). Moreover, the dominant negative mutant of mixed lineage kinase 3 inhibited hematopoietic progenitor kinase-1-induced JNK activation (4.Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.I EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Thus, MEKK1, TAK1, and mixed lineage kinase 3 are downstream kinases of group I GCKs. In this study, we demonstrated that the dominant negative form of MEKK1 inhibited NESK-induced JNK activation, suggesting that MEKK1 is a downstream target kinase of NESK. It is known that MEKK1 stimulates MKK4, which in turn activates JNK. JNK activation induced by NESK was inhibited by the dominant negative mutant of MKK4, suggesting that MKK4 is a downstream kinase of MEKK1 whose activity is induced by NESK. Group I GCKs have an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain of GCK and NIK interacts with MEKK1 and overexpression of this domain alone can activate JNK (8.Su Y.-C. Han J. Xu S. Cobb M. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 10.Yuasa T. Ohno S. Kehrl J.H. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22681-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of GCK-like kinase seems to be essential for maximal activation of JNK because the C-terminal truncation mutant of GCK-like kinase has a greatly reduced ability to activate JNK (5.Diener K. Wang X.S. Chen C. Meyer C.F. Keesler G. Zukowski M. Tan T.-H. Yao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9687-9692Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Because the C-terminal domain of NESK shares high sequence homology with that of NIK, it is possible that it functions as a regulatory domain for a downstream substrate. However, the kinase domain of NESK alone was able to activate the JNK pathway. Further characterization is required to determine a role of the C-terminal domain of NESK in regulating the JNK pathway.Because the JNK pathway is stimulated by a variety of stress-inducing agents and proinflammatory cytokines, it is possible that NESK activates the pathway in response to upstream signals. A crucial role for TRAF2 in coupling the TNF receptor to JNK activation has been substantiated by a study of cells from TRAF2 knockout mice; TRAF2-deficient cells do not stimulate JNK activity in response to TNF-α (27.Yeh W.-C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billa F. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J.L. Ferrick D. Hum B. Iscove N. Ohashi P. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Immunity. 1997; 7: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). It has been shown that two group I GCK family members, GCK and TRAF2- and Nck-interacting kinase, interact with TRAF2. In the present study, we have demonstrated that TNF-α and TRAF2 stimulated the NESK activity, and the dominant negative mutant of NESK blocked TNF-α- or TRAF2-induced JNK activation. Thus, NESK may interact with TRAF2 and play a role in coupling TRAF2, as well as TNF-α, to JNK activation.In this study, we have found candidates of components functioning upstream and downstream of NESK in mammalian cells. However, NESK seems to be expressed in specific types of cells at the late stages of mouse embryogenesis. Thus, the identification of upstream and downstream signaling molecules of NESK in these cells will provide valuable insights into the signaling pathway regulated by NESK. The germinal center kinase (GCK)1 family is a subfamily of the Ste20 family of protein kinases (1.Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5259-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). GCK family members have an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain.

Among them, GCK, GCK-related kinase, and TRAF2- and Nck-interacting kinase have been implicated in mediating the TNF-α-induced JNK activation through TRAF2 (7.Shi C.-S. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol.

The JNK activation by group I GCKs such as GCK and GCK-like kinase is mediated through the MEKK1 and MKK4 kinase cascade (5.Diener K. Wang X.S. Chen C. Meyer C.F. Keesler G. Zukowski M. Tan T.-H.

NIK and TRAF2- and Nck-interacting kinase interact with the Src homology 2-Src homology 3 domain-containing adapter protein Nck and have been proposed to link protein tyrosine kinase signals to the JNK activation (8.Su Y.-C. Han J. Xu S. Cobb M. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 13.Fu C.A. Shen M. Huang B.C.B. Lasaga J. Payan D.G. Luo Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30729-30737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The Drosophila Misshapen and C. elegans Mig-15 proteins are highly homologous to mammalian NIK, both within and outside of the kinase domain (19.Su Y.-C. Treisman J.E. Skolnik E.Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The Misshapen protein functions upstream of basket, the Drosophila homologue of JNK, and hemipterous, a homologue of MKK7, to stimulate dorsal closure in the Drosophila embryo (19.Su Y.-C. Treisman J.E. Skolnik E.Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Dorsal closure occurs during the later stages in Drosophila embryogenesis and involves cell migrations and shape changes that position and fuse the lateral epidermal primordia over the aminoserosa. TheDrosophila TRAF binds Misshapen in vitro, and coexpression of Misshapen and Drosophila TRAF leads to the synergistic activation of JNK (20.Liu H. Su Y.-C. Becker E. Treisman J. Skolnik E.Y. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 101-104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). The C. elegans Mig-15 is necessary for several developmental processes in C. elegans. mig-15 mutants have a variety of developmental defects including defects in Q-neuroblast migration and muscle arm targeting (19.Su Y.-C. Treisman J.E. Skolnik E.Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, GCKs may be responsible for some of the developmental processes in mammals. We report here a novel mammalian group I GCK family kinase isolated from mouse embryo by a PCR-based screen for cDNA clones of protein kinases. It is expressed during the late stages of mouse embryogenesis, but not in various adult tissues, and has the highest homology to NIK. Thus, this newly identified kinase was designated NESK (NIK-like embryo-specifickinase). We demonstrate in this report that NESK, like other group I GCK family members, can selectively activate the JNK pathway when overexpressed in HEK 293 cells. Furthermore, dominant negative forms of MEKK1 and MKK4 inhibited the NESK-induced JNK activation, and a dominant negative NESK mutant inhibited TRAF2-induced JNK activation, suggesting that NESK functions downstream of TRAF2 and upstream of MEKK1 and MKK4 in the JNK signaling pathway. DISCUSSIONIn this study, we identified a novel protein kinase, NESK, from mouse embryo. NESK shares high sequence homology with members of the group I GCK family in both the N-terminal kinase domain and the C-terminal putative regulatory domain. All members of the group I GCK family selectively activate the JNK pathway when overexpressed in cultured cells but do not stimulate the p38 kinase or ERK signaling pathways (1.Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5259-5262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). NESK also activates the JNK pathway when overexpressed in HEK 293 cells but does not activate the p38 kinase or ERK pathways. Based on these structural and functional properties, it can be concluded that NESK is a novel member of the group I GCK family.NESK mRNA is expressed exclusively during the late stages of mouse embryogenesis. Further, NESK is highly homologous to theDrosophila Misshapen and C. elegans Mig-15 proteins, both in the kinase domain and in the C-terminal regulatory domain. The Misshapen protein functions upstream of the JNK pathway to stimulate dorsal closure in the Drosophila embryo (19.Su Y.-C. Treisman J.E. Skolnik E.Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Dorsal closure occurs during the late stages of Drosophilaembryogenesis. The Mig-15 protein is necessary for several developmental processes in C. elegans (19.Su Y.-C. Treisman J.E. Skolnik E.Y. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 2371-2380Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, NESK is suggested to function as an intracellular signaling molecule in a developmental process during the late stages of mammalian embryogenesis. More recently, a novel member of the group I GCK family, named NRK, was cloned from mouse embryo (26.Kanai-Azuma M. Kanai Y. Okamoto M. Hayashi Y. Yonekawa H. Yazaki K. Mech. Dev. 1999; 89: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). NESK is 99% identical to NRK. Moreover, the expression pattern of NESK mRNA is similar to that of NRK mRNA. Thus, although the role of NRK in the JNK pathway has not been determined, NESK is probably the same protein as NRK.In situ hybridization revealed that NRK was predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle during the late stages in mouse embryogenesis (26.Kanai-Azuma M. Kanai Y. Okamoto M. Hayashi Y. Yonekawa H. Yazaki K. Mech. Dev. 1999; 89: 155-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Dorsal closure in Drosophilaembryogenesis involves cell migrations. mig-15 mutants have developmental defects in Q-neuroblast migration and muscle arm targeting. Thus, NESK may participate in intracellular signaling involved in muscle cell migration.It has been shown that the dominant negative mutant of MEKK1 inhibited GCK-, NIK-, GCK-like kinase-, or GCK-related kinase-induced JNK activation (5.Diener K. Wang X.S. Chen C. Meyer C.F. Keesler G. Zukowski M. Tan T.-H. Yao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9687-9692Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 7.Shi C.-S. Kehrl J.H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 22681-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Hematopoietic progenitor kinase/GCK-like kinase-induced JNK activation has been shown to be inhibited by the dominant negative mutant of TAK1 but not by that of MEKK1(11). Moreover, the dominant negative mutant of mixed lineage kinase 3 inhibited hematopoietic progenitor kinase-1-induced JNK activation (4.Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.I EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Thus, MEKK1, TAK1, and mixed lineage kinase 3 are downstream kinases of group I GCKs. In this study, we demonstrated that the dominant negative form of MEKK1 inhibited NESK-induced JNK activation, suggesting that MEKK1 is a downstream target kinase of NESK. It is known that MEKK1 stimulates MKK4, which in turn activates JNK. JNK activation induced by NESK was inhibited by the dominant negative mutant of MKK4, suggesting that MKK4 is a downstream kinase of MEKK1 whose activity is induced by NESK. Group I GCKs have an N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain of GCK and NIK interacts with MEKK1 and overexpression of this domain alone can activate JNK (8.Su Y.-C. Han J. Xu S. Cobb M. Skolnik E.Y. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1279-1290Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 10.Yuasa T. Ohno S. Kehrl J.H. Kyriakis J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22681-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of GCK-like kinase seems to be essential for maximal activation of JNK because the C-terminal truncation mutant of GCK-like kinase has a greatly reduced ability to activate JNK (5.Diener K. Wang X.S. Chen C. Meyer C.F. Keesler G. Zukowski M. Tan T.-H. Yao Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9687-9692Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Because the C-terminal domain of NESK shares high sequence homology with that of NIK, it is possible that it functions as a regulatory domain for a downstream substrate. However, the kinase domain of NESK alone was able to activate the JNK pathway. Further characterization is required to determine a role of the C-terminal domain of NESK in regulating the JNK pathway.Because the JNK pathway is stimulated by a variety of stress-inducing agents and proinflammatory cytokines, it is possible that NESK activates the pathway in response to upstream signals. A crucial role for TRAF2 in coupling the TNF receptor to JNK activation has been substantiated by a study of cells from TRAF2 knockout mice; TRAF2-deficient cells do not stimulate JNK activity in response to TNF-α (27.Yeh W.-C. Shahinian A. Speiser D. Kraunus J. Billa F. Wakeham A. de la Pompa J.L. Ferrick D. Hum B. Iscove N. Ohashi P. Rothe M. Goeddel D.V. Mak T.W. Immunity. 1997; 7: 715-725Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (711) Google Scholar). It has been shown that two group I GCK family members, GCK and TRAF2- and Nck-interacting kinase, interact with TRAF2. In the present study, we have demonstrated that TNF-α and TRAF2 stimulated the NESK activity, and the dominant negative mutant of NESK blocked TNF-α- or TRAF2-induced JNK activation. Thus, NESK may interact with TRAF2 and play a role in coupling TRAF2, as well as TNF-α, to JNK activation.In this study, we have found candidates of components functioning upstream and downstream of NESK in mammalian cells. However, NESK seems to be expressed in specific types of cells at the late stages of mouse embryogenesis. Thus, the identification of upstream and downstream signaling molecules of NESK in these cells will provide valuable insights into the signaling pathway regulated by NESK.

https://openalex.org/W2045255717,"The mechanisms by which ethanol inhibits hepatocyte proliferation have been a source of some considerable investigation. Our studies have suggested a possible role for tissue transglutaminase (tTG) in this process. Others have shown that tTG has two distinctly different functions: it catalyzes protein cross-linking, which can lead to apoptosis and enhancement of extracellular matrix stability, and it can function as a G protein (Gαh). Under that circumstance, we speculated that the cross-linking activity would be decreased and that it would function to enhance hepatocyte proliferation in response to adrenergic stimulation. Ethanol treatment inhibited hepatocyte proliferation and led to enhanced tTG cross-linking activity, whereas treatment of hepatocytes with an α1 adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine, enhanced hepatocyte proliferation while decreasing tTG cross-linking. However, phenylephrine treatment of several hepatoma cell lines had no effect on cellular proliferation or tTG cross-linking activity, and of note, Northern blot analysis demonstrated that whereas primary hepatocytes had high levels of the α1β adrenergic receptor (α1BAR) mRNA, the hepatoma cell lines did not have this mRNA. When the Hep G2 cell line was stably transduced with an expression vector containing the α1BR cDNA, the cell line responded to phenylephrine treatment with enhanced proliferation and with decreased tTG cross-linking activity. Ethanol treatment of the α1BAR-transfected cells suppressed the phospholipase C-mediated signaling pathways, as detected in the phenylephrine-induced Ca2+ response. These results suggest that phenylephrine stimulation of hepatocyte proliferation appears to be occurring through the α1BAR, which is known to be coupled with the tTG G protein moiety, Gαh, and that tTG appears to play a significant role in either enhancing or inhibiting hepatocyte proliferation, depending on its cellular location and on whether it functions as a cross-linking enzyme or a G protein.

Wands J.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1985; 128: 767-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and in vivo (2.Diehl A.M. Chacon M.A. Wagner P. Hepatology. 1988; 8: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) systems. Although some associations have been found, the mechanism by which this inhibition occurs has not been delineated. One such association is that ethanol has been shown to decrease putrescine levels in the liver and that putrescine administration abrogates this inhibition of liver regeneration by ethanol administration (3.Diehl A.M. Abdo S. Brown N. Hepatology. 1990; 12: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which putrescine has this effect is not known. One possibility is that putrescine may be exerting this effect on liver regeneration through its known action as a competitive substrate inhibitor of tissue transglutaminase (tTG)1 activity.Tissue transglutaminase (transglutaminase II) is a member of a family of transglutaminases that are calcium-dependent enzymes that catalyze the posttranslational modification of proteins through cross-linking via ε(γ-glutamyl lysine) bonds (4.Barsigain C. Stern A.M. Martinez J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22501-22509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although its physiological significance has not been proven, tTG has been implicated to be involved in extracellular matrix organization (5.Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 71: 402-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar) and in inhibition of cell growth and proliferation (6.Katoh S. Nakagawa N. Yano Y. Satoh K. Kohno H. Ohkubo Y. Suzuki T. Kitani K. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 222: 255-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We have demonstrated that its transglutaminase cross-linking activity is increased in humans with acute liver injury and in model systems of hepatic injury and fibrosis (7.Mirza A. Liu S.L. Frizell E. Zhu J.L. Maddukuri S. Martinez J. Davies P.J.A. Schwarting R. Norton P.A. Zern M.A. Am. J.

Thomazy V. Davies P.J.A. Zern M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G240-G245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its tissue transglutaminase cross-linking (tTGase) activity, tTG is unique in that it also is a GTP-binding protein, with GTPase activity referred to as Gαh (9.Im M.J. Russel M.A. Feng J.-F. Cell Signal. 1997; 9: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In this role as a G protein, the Gαh molecule is associated with a 50-kDa B subunit (Gβh), from which it dissociates following stimulation through the α1B adrenergic receptor (α1BAR) and activates a 69-kDa phospholipase C (PLC-δ1) (10.Nakaoka H.

It is thought that a switch mechanism may exist, with adrenergic stimulation activating its G-protein function and inhibiting its tTGase activity (9.Im M.J. Russel M.A. Feng J.-F. Cell Signal. 1997; 9: 477-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).Adrenergic agonists such as epinephrine and phenylephrine have been shown by a series of authors to enhance hepatocyte proliferation (11.Michalopoulos G.K.

Adrenergic receptor activation by these agonists causes activation of phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C, which produces the two intracellular messengers diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate, which mediate the activation of protein kinase C and intracellular Ca2+ release, respectively. Ethanol causes the desensitization of receptor-mediated PLC activation in agonist-treated hepatocytes (14.Higashi K. Hoek J.B. J. Biol.

Thus, the mechanisms by which phenylephrine and ethanol affect hepatocyte proliferation require further analysis.In the present study, we have investigated the significance of both the tTGase and GTPase activity of tissue transglutaminase on hepatocyte proliferation. Our results suggest that whereas its tTGase activity is associated with inhibition of proliferation, its G protein activity appears to be a mechanism whereby hepatocyte proliferation is enhanced. The findings further indicate that phenylephrine stimulation of cellular proliferation may well be occurring through binding to the α1BAR that is coupled with the tTG molecule, Gαh.RESULTSBecause tTG cross-linking activity (tTGase) has been associated with apoptosis and inhibition of cellular proliferation in other systems, we first investigated its activity when primary rat hepatocytes were treated with ethanol. Our hypothesis was that ethanol would enhance tTG expression, leading in turn to an inhibition of proliferation, and that putrescine may enhance hepatocyte proliferation by its action as a substrate inhibitor of tTG activity. Rat hepatocytes were isolated by standard techniques and then treated with 100 or 150 mm ethanol for 24 h. This treatment did not cause liver cell necrosis as monitored by lactate dehydrogenase leakage (data not shown), but it led to nuclear fragmentation visualized by acridine orange staining when the cells were exposed to ethanol for as little as 4 h at a concentration of 100 mm (Fig.1). In addition, ethanol treatment inhibited hepatocyte proliferation as measured by [3H]thymidine incorporation, and it also enhanced tTG cross-linking activity as measured by [14C]putrescine incorporation into proteins (Fig. 2,top panel). The bottom panels of Fig. 2 show a representative image of tTG mRNA transcripts by Northern blot analysis using human tTG cDNA as a probe when half the cells were treated with ethanol. The densitometry data in the bottom right panel of Fig. 2 were summarized from three Northern blot experiments and are expressed as percentage of controls. Ethanol treatment at 100 mm consistently enhanced tTG mRNA gene expression in cultured rat hepatocytes compared with the controls.Figure 2Ethanol-induced inhibition of rat hepatocyte proliferation and enhancement of tTG mRNA expression (bottom panel) and activity (top panel) in the cells. [3H]Thymidine incorporation into the cells after 4 h of incubation was employed as an indicator of hepatocyte DNA synthesis, and [14C]putrescine incorporation was used as an indicator of tTGase activity.

Treatment of the hepatocytes with GTPγS, a selective inhibitor of tTGase activity, at a concentration of 20 μm abrogated the ethanol-induced inhibition of hepatocyte proliferation, and at the same time it reduced ethanol-induced elevation of tTG activity (Fig.3, top panel). Putrescine treatment at a concentration of 50 μm also significantly decreased tTGase activity at the same time that it strikingly reduced the inhibition of hepatocyte proliferation due to ethanol treatment (Fig. 3, bottom panel).Figure 3GTPγS or putrescine corrects the inhibition of rat hepatocyte proliferation and enhancement of tTG activity caused by ethanol treatment. The cells were treated with a combination of ethanol (150 mm) with GTP-γ-S (20 μm) (top panel) or with putrescine (50 μm) (bottom panel) overnight, and hepatocyte proliferation and tTGase activity were evaluated as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data were summarized from five or six independent experiments and expressed as a percentage of the controls. **, p < 0.01 compared with the controls, #, p < 0.01 compared with ethanol treatment alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To further investigate the role of tTGase in hepatocyte proliferation, the cells were treated with an α1 adrenergic receptor agonist, phenylephrine (PNLP). As expected, PNLP at concentrations of 1–20 μm caused an enhancement of cell proliferation. At the same time, PNLP decreased tTGase activity in the cells (Fig.4, top panel). These effects were abrogated by ethanol treatment at concentrations of 100–150 mm (Fig. 4, bottom panel). Next, a series of selective inhibitors were employed to demonstrate that this effect of PNLP was indeed occurring through the adrenergic receptor system. ET-18-OCH3, a selective phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C inhibitor, reduced the phenylephrine-induced increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation at a concentration of 1.0–5.0 μm (Fig. 5,top panel). In addition, treatment of the cells with chelerythrine chloride, a selective protein kinase C inhibitor, at a dose of 1–5 μm similarly decreased the effect of phenylephrine (Fig. 5, bottom panel).Figure 4PNLP-stimulated rat hepatocyte proliferation and decrease in tTGase activity (top panel) and effects of ethanol on PNLP actions (bottom panel).

Northern blot analysis revealed that substantial amounts of α1BAR were found in rat hepatocytes, but none was present in Hep G2 and Alexander cells (Fig.6, top panel). This led us to question whether that specific receptor was important in the effects of phenylephrine on hepatocyte proliferation. To investigate this hypothesis, stable cell lines were produced in Hep G2 cells using a Neo-selectable system. Lines were produced that were transduced with the selectable marker vector alone or with the addition of an expression plasmid that contained the α1BAR cDNA. Fig. 6,bottom panel, demonstrates the presence or absence of α1BAR mRNA in control cells or in cells transduced with the plasmids. Representative clones were grown and treatment of the new cell lines was undertaken with phenylephrine. It is shown in Fig.7 that treatment of the Hep G2 cells that were transduced with the α1BAR cDNA with phenylephrine led to hepatocyte proliferation and decreased tTGase activity. Treatment of the cell line containing only the Neo marker plasmid with phenylephrine had no effect on hepatocyte proliferation or tTGase activity.Figure 6Expression of α1BAR in rat hepatocytes and hepatoma cell lines with or without transduction with an α1BAR cDNA.

Phenylephrine stimulation of α1BAR cells resulted in a transient Ca2+ elevation in the majority of the cells (ranging from 50 to 80% of total cells in different experiments) but had no significant effect on Neo cells. The elevation of [Ca2+]i in individual cells occurred after a lag time of several minutes, with a relatively broad peak elevation of approximately 300 nm over the basal [Ca2+]i, often with superimposed irregular oscillations (Fig. 8 A). In a small fraction (<20%) of the cells, a more regular Ca2+oscillation pattern was obtained, in which the Ca2+concentration returned to basal levels between individual peaks. No significant differences in basal Ca2+ concentrations were observed between cells that responded to phenylephrine treatment and those that did not, or between the α1BAR cells and the Neo cells (Table I). Treatment of the α1BAR cells with ethanol at 100 mm for 5 min prior to phenylephrine stimulation markedly suppressed the Ca2+ response, with only 13% of the cells responding to phenylephrine (Table I). Thus, ethanol suppressed α1B adrenergic receptor-mediated signaling in these cells by almost 80%. The small fraction of cells that retained a response to phenylephrine was distinct in that the lag phase prior to the onset of the Ca2+ transient was significantly shorter than in the untreated cells and the responding cells had much shorter transients, occurring either singly or as multiple oscillations (>80% of the responding cells; see Fig. 8 B), suggesting that this may represent a subfraction of cells with distinct characteristics of Ca2+ signaling. Surprisingly, when α1BAR cells were pretreated with ethanol for 2 h, the suppression of the phenylephrine-induced Ca2+ signaling was overcome, and the cells recovered their Ca2+ response. Although the recovery resulted in many cells showing broad Ca2+ transients that were similar to those in untreated cells, a large fraction (close to 50%) of the recovered cells had more regular oscillation characteristics with shorter Ca2+ transients than the untreated α1BAR cells (Fig. 8 C). Because prolonged ethanol exposure did not reverse the ethanol enhancement of tTG activity, the recovery data may indicate that the cells can adapt to generate a Gh conformation that couples to α1BAR while still retaining tTG activity. However, an alternative explanation is that the α1B adrenergic receptor under these conditions can be induced to couple to other G proteins, e.g. Gq, which activates a different PLC isoform, namely PLC-β1 (23.Lee C.H. Park D. Wu D. Rhee S.G. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16044-16047Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The α1B receptor coupling to Gq (or closely related members of the G protein family) has been demonstrated in cotransfection studies (24.Wu D. Katz A. Lee C.H. Simon M.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25798-25802Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), although the factors that control the choice by the receptor of its G protein partner have not been elucidated. If this suggestion is correct, it is likely that the signaling pathways that are linked to the enhancement of proliferation are selective for the Gh-coupled PLC-δ1 activation mechanism. This may also explain previous reports that vasopressin, which is a potent activator of PLC-β1 in hepatocytes through V1a receptors that are coupled to Gq, is much less effective than phenylephrine in enhancing hepatocyte proliferation (25.Houck K.A. Michalopoulos G.K. J. Cell.

Liu S.L. Frizell E. Zhu J.L. Maddukuri S. Martinez J. Davies P.J.A. Schwarting R. Norton P.A. Zern M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 35: G281-G288Google Scholar), and that it appears that TNF-α enhances the expression of tTG (8.Kuncio G.S. Tsyganskya M. Zhu J.L. Liu S.L. Nagy L. Thomazy V. Davies P.J.A. Zern M.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 274: G240-G245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present report, our results suggest that tTG may manifest two distinct and somewhat conflicting activities in hepatocytes depending on the cellular milieu. During acute or chronic CCl4 intoxication or during acute ethanol administration, tTG cross-linking activity was enhanced, probably contributing to the often-described inhibitory effects of toxins (or the fibrotic process) on hepatocyte proliferation. On the other hand, α-adrenergic stimulation of hepatocyte proliferation appears to act, at least in part, through tTG G protein activation (GTPase activity).A series of studies has shown that both acute and chronic ethanol exposure inhibits hepatic regeneration (3.Diehl A.M. Abdo S. Brown N. Hepatology. 1990; 12: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 26.Wands J. Carter E. Bucher N. Isselbacher K.

Res. 1995; 19: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Ethanol has also been shown to inhibit putrescine levels in the liver (3.Diehl A.M. Abdo S. Brown N. Hepatology. 1990; 12: 633-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 28.Tanaka T. Ando M. Yamashita T. Toda T. Monna T. Nishiguchi S. Matsui T. Kuroki T. Otani S. Maezono K. Mawatari K. Alcohol Alcohol. 1993; 28: 41-45Crossref Google Scholar), and the administration of putrescine (27.Shibley L.A. Gavigan M.D. Pennington S.N. Alcohol. Clin. Exp. Res. 1995; 19: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) or its precursors, alanine or glutamine (28.Tanaka T. Ando M. Yamashita T. Toda T. Monna T. Nishiguchi S. Matsui T. Kuroki T. Otani S. Maezono K. Mawatari K. Alcohol Alcohol. 1993; 28: 41-45Crossref Google Scholar), abrogates this inhibition of liver regeneration by ethanol administration. The mechanism by which putrescine abolishes this effect of ethanol on regeneration is unknown. The hypothesis that we have investigated is that putrescine may be exerting this effect on liver regeneration through its known action as a competitive substrate inhibitor of tTGase activity (29.Dolynchuk K.N. Bendor-Samuel R. Bowness J.M. Plastic Reconstr. Surg. 1994; 93: 567-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). This action of putrescine is important because tTG has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation by a number of investigators in other systems. This is thought to occur by delaying the progression of the cells from S-phase to G2/M. (30.Mian S. El Alaoui S. Lawry J. Gentile V. Davies P.J.A. Griffin M. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 31.Katoh S. Hashimoto M. Kohno H. Ohkubo Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 303: 421-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Our speculation is that ethanol or other profibrogenic agents may enhance tTG expression and tTGase activity, leading in turn to an inhibition of the proliferation cascade, and that putrescine may enhance hepatocyte proliferation by inhibiting tTGase activity.Our results in this report indicate that ethanol administration enhances tTGase activity at concentrations that inhibit hepatocyte proliferation in vitro. Although ethanol administration slightly but reproducibly enhanced tTG mRNA levels (see Fig. 2,bottom panel), its effects on tTGase activity were greater (Fig. 2, top panel), suggesting an additional posttranslational mechanism. Moreover, two inhibitors of tTGase, putrescine, and GTPγS abrogated the ethanol inhibition of hepatocyte proliferation at the same time that they inhibited the cross-linking activity.These findings suggest that ethanol-induced inhibition of hepatocyte proliferation could be caused, at least in part, by enhanced tTGase activity. This effect is likely to be due not only to the inhibition by tTG of cell proliferation but also to the known association of tTG with apoptosis. Our results indicate that hepatocytes demonstrate both diminished proliferation and apoptosis with ethanol treatment (Figs. 1and 2). This finding of apoptosis induced by ethanol administration may explain the conflicting results concerning the toxic effects of ethanol on hepatocytes. It is consistent with reports of others that ethanol-induced hepatocyte cytotoxicity may be due to apoptosis (32.Lamb R.G. Kock J.C. Snyder J.W. Huband S.M. Bush S. Hepatology. 1994; 19: 174-182PubMed Google Scholar), whereas other have reported cell necrosis with ethanol treatment under special circumstances (33.Kurose I. Higuchi H. Miura S. Saito H.

Hepatology. 1997; 25: 368-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar).It is a well established finding that a series of α1 adrenergic agonists, such as epinephrine and phenylephrine, enhances hepatocyte proliferation (11.Michalopoulos G.K.

https://openalex.org/W1985047679,"Presenilin 1 (PS1) plays a pivotal role in the production of the amyloid-β protein, which is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. It has been demonstrated that PS1 regulates the γ-secretase proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) C-terminal fragment (APP-C100), which is the final step in amyloid-β protein production. The mechanism and detailed pathway of this PS1 activity has yet to be fully resolved, but it may be due to a presenilin-controlled trafficking of the APP fragment or possibly an inherent PS1 proteolytic activity. We have investigated the possibility of a direct interaction of PS1 and the APP-C100 within the high molecular mass presenilin complex. However, the APP-C100 is rapidly degraded, and if it forms, then any PS1·APP complex is likely to be very transitory. To circumvent this problem, we have utilized the protease inhibitor <i>N</i>-acetyl-leucyl-norleucinal (LLnL) and the lysosomotropic agent NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, which inhibits the turnover of the APP-C100. Under these conditions, levels of the fragment increased appreciably, and as shown by glycerol gradient analysis, the APP-C100 shifted to a higher molecular mass complex that overlapped with PS1. Immunoprecipitation studies demonstrated that a significant population of the APP-C100 co-precipitated with PS1. These findings suggest that PS1 may mediate the shuttling of APP fragments and/or facilitate their presentation for γ-secretase cleavage through a direct interaction."

A conserved arginine residue in the TM2–TM3 loop of the GABAA-R α2 subunit was mutated to alanine, and the mutant α2(R274A) was co-expressed with wild-type β1 and γ2Ssubunits in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. The GABA EC50 was increased by about 27-fold in the mutant receptor relative to receptors containing a wild-type α2 subunit.

The GABAA-R is made up of five glycoprotein subunits that have been proposed to contain four transmembrane domains (TM1–TM4) with part of the TM2 sequence of each subunit contributing to the channel pore (3Xu M.

The native GABAA-Rs are most commonly composed of two α subunits, two β subunits, and one γ subunit (5Chang Y. Wang R. Barot S. Weiss D.S. J.

To date, six α-, four β-, and four γ-subunit isoforms have been cloned in addition to a number of evolutionarily related subunit families (7McKernan R.M. Whiting P.J.

Residues Tyr-157, Thr-160, Thr-202, and Tyr-205 in the β2 subunit have also been proposed to contribute to the GABA binding site (9Amin J. Weiss D.S. Nature. 1993; 366: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The diagram displays the position of the α2(Arg-274) residue that is the primary focus of this study and is located within the predicted short extracellular loop between TM2 and TM3. The function of the TM2–TM3 loop in GABAA-R subunits is currently unknown, but the corresponding region of the Gly-R α subunit has been proposed to influence the efficiency of agonist-induced gating (10Rajendra S. Schofield P.R. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 80-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A partial sequence alignment of Gly-R α1 compared with GABAA-R α2, β1, and γ2 subunits (Fig. 1 B) illustrates the similarity between the amino acid sequences in the TM2–TM3 loop within the group of receptor subunits. We therefore predicted that mutations in this region of the GABAA-R will produce similar effects on receptor gating.GABAA-R amino acid residues α2(Arg-274), α2(Leu-277), and α2(Lys-279) are homologous to the residues in the Gly-R α1 subunit that alter the glycine EC50 when mutated (Arg-271 (11Laube B.

R271Q, R271L, and K276E are naturally occurring point mutations that dramatically reduce glycine receptor sensitivity to agonist and are associated with the human neurological disorder hereditary hyperekplexia. These mutations increase the EC50 and reduce the maximal response of the glycine receptor agonists taurine and β-alanine, although the mutations do not alter the binding of the competitive glycine receptor antagonist [3H]strychnine (12Lynch J.W. Rajendra S. Pierce K.D. Handford C.A. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar).To explore whether these conserved arginine residues in the GABAA-R play a role in receptor function, we mutated each of the homologous arginines to alanine and determined the resulting GABA EC50 (also known as potency or apparent affinity). In addition, we performed an alanine scan of the TM2–TM3 loop to identify other residues in the α subunit that may be important for GABAA-R function. Finally, we measured the effects of selected mutations on the maximal response (relative efficacy) of piperidine-4-sulfonic acid (P4S) relative to GABA.RESULTSA comparison of the GABA responses of wild-type α2β1γ2S GABAAreceptors (Fig. 2 A) and mutant α2(R274A)β1γ2S receptors (Fig. 2 B) in HEK 293 cells shows that brief applications of agonist to either receptor combination produced saturable concentration-dependent inward currents. The amplitudes of the maximal GABA response were similar in wild-type and mutant receptors (data not shown). However, inspection of the pooled data (Fig.2 C and Table I) revealed that α2(R274A)β1γ2S receptors gave a 27-fold increase in the GABA EC50 indicating that the mutant receptors were significantly less sensitive to GABA than the wild-type receptors.Figure 2GABA EC50 is higher at the mutant α2(R274A)β1γ2Sthan at wild-type α2β1γ2S GABAA receptors.

Open table in a new tab We then characterized the GABA responses of receptors containing β1(R267A) or γ2L(R296A) subunits that were again co-expressed with the appropriate wild-type subunits. Both mutant subunits (similar to the α2(R274A) subunit) were incorporated into functional GABAA receptors, but neither mutation produced significant shifts in the GABA EC50 (Fig.2 C). The long splice variant of the γ2 subunit was used as a background to make the mutant γ2L(R296A) subunit. Therefore, the GABA EC50 for wild-type α2β1γ2L receptors is included in Table I for comparison. There was no statistical difference between the GABA EC50 values for receptors containing either the γ2S or γ2L splice variant, and the α2β1γ2L(R296A) GABA EC50 was not significantly different from wild-type α2β1γ2L receptors.We next examined the α2(Arg-274) residue in greater detail to determine the effects of different amino acid substitutions on the GABA EC50. We chose mutations at this position that would neutralize a positive charge (R274Q), replace a positive with a negative charge (R274D), or replace the larger arginine residue with a smaller hydroxyl-containing residue (R274S) or make a conservative replacement (R274K). GABAA receptors containing α2(R274Q) or α2(R274D) exhibited smaller (7-fold) changes in GABA EC50 than receptors containing α2(R274A) (Fig. 3). In contrast, the GABA EC50 was not significantly altered at α2(R274S)β1γ2S or α2(R274K)β1γ2S receptors.Figure 3Alanine substitution at the α2(Arg-274) position gave the largest effect on the GABA EC50 of tested mutant receptors.

Using alanine-scanning mutagenesis, we discovered two more substitutions that decreased GABA sensitivity. GABA α2(L277A)β1γ2S receptors showed a 51-fold increase in GABA EC50 when compared with wild-type receptors, and α2(K279A) showed a 4-fold increase whereas α2(P278A) did not alter the GABA EC50 (Fig. 4). Other mutations produced no changes in GABA EC50 (Table I).Figure 4The α2(R274A), α2(L277A), and α2(K279A) mutations produced the largest effects on the GABA EC50 in the TM2–TM3 extracellular loop.

Sci. 1957; 146: 369-381Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) at least two sequential events must occur prior to receptor activation, each one determined by the ratio of individual microscopic rate constants as shown in Scheme FS1. First, the agonist (A) must bind to the receptor (R), and second, the agonist-receptor complex (AR) must isomerize into the open state (AR*). Therefore, GABA EC50 may be influenced at either step in the receptor activation pathway. As a result, steady-state measurements of GABA EC50 or [3H]GABA binding alone will not determine whether a mutation in the receptor affects the affinity of agonist bindingper se or alters receptor gating efficiency from an allosteric site (22Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar).Scheme 1View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To address this issue, we used a traditional partial agonist approach (23Downie D.L.

Brain Res. 2000; 852: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) to determine whether gating of the GABAA-R is impaired in α2(R274A)β1γ2S receptors. Rather than individually determining each of the rate constants shown in Scheme FS1, we compared the ε of the fractional maximal responseversus GABA of P4S (27Krogsgaard-Larsen P. Falch E. Schousboe A. Curtis D.R. Lodge D. J. Neurochem. 1980; 34: 756-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 28Krogsgaard-Larsen P. Snowman A. Lummis S.C. Olsen R.W. J. Neurochem. 1981; 37: 401-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) at wild-type and mutant receptors. Because the agonist relative efficacy is directly dependent on the isomerization process (β/α, Ref. 22Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar), we predict that a change in gating should be accompanied by an alteration in the relative efficacy of a partial agonist.P4S produced responses in wild-type α2β1γ2S receptors (Fig.5 A) (TableII) that were similar in maximal amplitude to GABA responses (Fig. 5 A, last trace). In contrast, α2(R274A)β1γ2S receptors exhibited maximal P4S responses that were on average about half of the amplitude of the maximal current elicited by GABA (Fig. 5 B). As shown in the pooled data, P4S has both an increased EC50and decreased relative efficacy at α2(R274A)β1γ2S receptors when compared with wild-type receptors (Fig. 5 C). The same approach was then applied to receptors containing mutant α2(L277A) subunits that showed a large increase in GABA EC50 as well as α2(P278A)β1γ2S receptors with no significant change in GABA EC50. We found that P4S had a higher EC50 and lower relative efficacy at α2(L277A)β1γ2S receptors than at wild-type receptors whereas the α2(P278A) mutation produced no change in P4S EC50 or relative efficacy (Fig. 6).Figure 5P4S has a lower relative efficacy and higher EC50 at α2(R274A)β1γ2Sthan wild-type α2β1γ2Sreceptors.

Our results imply specific structural and functional roles for these residues because alanine replacement of neighboring residues in the TM2–TM3 loop of the GABA α2 subunit (N275A, S276A, P278A, V280A, and Y282A) produced no change in the GABA EC50.P4S is a partial agonist at α1-containing GABAA receptors (26O'Shea S.M. Wong L.C. Harrison N.L. Brain Res. 2000; 852: 344-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 29Ebert B. Wafford K.A. Whiting P.J. Krogsgaard-Larsen P. Kemp J.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 957-963PubMed Google Scholar) but showed a high relative efficacy at receptors containing either a wild-type α2subunit or α2(P278A), which is a mutant subunit that produced no effect on GABA EC50. In contrast, P4S showed a marked reduction in relative efficacy at receptors containing α2(R274A) or α2(L277A). We have therefore demonstrated a clear association between an increase in GABA EC50 and a reduction in P4S relative efficacy. Mutations that alter agonist binding alone produce lateral shifts in the concentration-effect curve with no change in relative efficacy (22Colquhoun D. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 125: 924-947Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar,30Kenakin T. Pharmacological Analysis of Drug-Receptor Interaction. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, New York1993Google Scholar). A mechanism in which the α2(R274A) and α2(L277A) mutations impair receptor isomerization is more consistent with a simultaneous increase in GABA EC50 and P4S EC50 and a decrease in P4S relative efficacy. However, we cannot rule out a simultaneous decrease in both binding affinity and gating efficiency.The contribution of the α subunit to the GABA binding site has been incompletely mapped. To date, α1(Phe-64) is the only residue in the GABAA-R that has been proven to interact directly with the agonist muscimol (using photoaffinity labeling, see Ref. 31Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20380-20387Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, receptors containing mutant α1(F64C), α1(R66C), or α1(S68C) are protected from modification by sulfhydryl reagents in the presence of GABA making Arg-66 and Ser-68 good candidates as additional GABA contact points (32Boileau A.J. Evers A.R. Davis A.F. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4847-4854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Other N-terminal residues of the α1 subunit, such as Arg-120 (33Westh-Hansen S.E. Witt M.R. Dekermendjian K. Liljefors T. Rasmussen P.B. Nielsen M. Neuroreport. 1999; 10: 2417-2421Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and Ile-121 (34Westh-Hansen S.E. Rasmussen P.B. Hastrup S. Nabekura J. Noguchi K. Akaike N. Witt M.R. Nielsen M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 329: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), have also been proposed to form part of the agonist binding site, but the evidence has been less direct. In those studies, α1(R120K) or α1(I121V) mutations produced dramatic increases in the EC50 of GABA and decreases in the binding of the competitive antagonist [3H]SR 95531.In contrast, a mutation that alters gating rather than binding should produce no change in antagonist affinity because it does not induce a conformational shift to the open state. Our results with α2(Lys-279) are complemented by those of a recent study (35Sigel E. Buhr A. Baur R. J. Neurochem. 1999; 73: 1758-1764Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) that reports that oocytes expressing rat α1(K278A), β2, and γ2S GABAA-R subunits show a 6-fold increase in GABA EC50. However, a Schild analysis shows no change in bicuculline affinity. Because GABA, P4S, and bicuculline all presumably compete at the GABA binding site, it seems unlikely that α2(Arg-274), α2(Leu-277), and α2(Lys-279) actually function as agonist contact points on the GABAA-R α subunit. We propose instead that the TM2–TM3 loop region of the GABAA-R α subunit plays a critical role in receptor gating.What physical characteristics of the amino acid side chain at position α2(Arg-274) are associated with efficient GABAA-R gating? The results of this study suggest that no simple correlation exists between the GABA EC50 and either the volume, polarity, or hydrophobicity of the residue at this position.Do these TM2–TM3 loops act as “hinges” (12Lynch J.W. Rajendra S. Pierce K.D. Handford C.A. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar) that limit the mobility of the TM2 transmembrane region in the presence of agonist? The TM2 domain of the GABAA-R, by analogy with the M2 domain of other members of the ligand-gated ion channel superfamily (36Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 162-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 37Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Stowell M. Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 288: 765-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar, 38Akabas M.H. Kaufmann C. Archdeacon P. Karlin A. Neuron. 1994; 13: 919-927Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar), is likely to be an α helix. In support of this prediction, the substituted cysteine accessibility method reveals that every third or fourth amino acid residue of the GABAA-R α1 subunit is accessible to a water-soluble alkylation reagent (4Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Conversely, within residues 59–68 of the GABAA-R α1 subunit, every second residue is accessible, thus providing evidence that this region is a β-strand (32Boileau A.J. Evers A.R. Davis A.F. Czajkowski C. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 4847-4854Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Unfortunately, no such structural information is yet available with the TM2–TM3 loop.Based on the similarity between the amino acid sequences of the GABAA and glycine receptor subunits, it is possible that the TM2–TM3 extracellular loop plays a similar role in GABAA and glycine receptor function (12Lynch J.W. Rajendra S. Pierce K.D. Handford C.A. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 39Vafa B. Schofield P.R. Int. Rev. Neurobiol. 1998; 42: 285-332Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One laboratory (13Lewis T.M. Sivilotti L.G. Colquhoun D. Gardiner R.M. Schoepfer R. Rees M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 507: 25-40Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar) has used single channel analysis of α1(K273E)β glycine receptors to measure an increase in the closing rate constant (Scheme FS1, α), whereas other researchers have shown that α1(R271Q) in the Gly-R reduces the single-channel conductance (25Rajendra S.

Bormann J. Betz H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 4223-4228Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Naturally occurring mutations of the TM2–TM3 loop in muscle nicotinic receptor subunits, which produce the slow-channel form of myasthenia gravis (41Zhou M. Engel A.G. Auerbach A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10466-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), alter the efficacy of the partial agonist choline by increasing the opening rate of the receptor (Scheme FS1, β). The TM2–TM3 loop may therefore also play a role in the gating of other ligand-gated ion channels within this gene family. The GABAA1receptor (GABAA-R) as well as the glycine (Gly-R) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptors belong to a homologous gene family of ligand-gated ion channels (1Johnston G.A. Pharmacol. Ther. 1996; 69: 173-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 2Schofield P.R. Darlison M.G. Fujita N. Burt D.R. Stephenson F.A. Rodriguez H. Rhee L.M. Ramachandran J. Reale V. Glencorse T.A. Seeburg P.H. Barnard E.A. Nature. 1987; 328: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1261) Google Scholar). The GABAA-R is made up of five glycoprotein subunits that have been proposed to contain four transmembrane domains (TM1–TM4) with part of the TM2 sequence of each subunit contributing to the channel pore (3Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21505-21508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The native GABAA-Rs are most commonly composed of two α subunits, two β subunits, and one γ subunit (5Chang Y. Wang R. Barot S. Weiss D.S. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 5415-5424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To date, six α-, four β-, and four γ-subunit isoforms have been cloned in addition to a number of evolutionarily related subunit families (7McKernan R.M. Whiting P.J. Trends Neurosci. 1996; 19: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 8Sigel E. Buhr A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 425-429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). A diagram of the presumed topology of the GABAA-R α2 subunit (Fig.1 A) shows those residues in the N-terminus that have been implicated as possible agonist contact points. Residues Tyr-157, Thr-160, Thr-202, and Tyr-205 in the β2 subunit have also been proposed to contribute to the GABA binding site (9Amin J. Weiss D.S. Nature. 1993; 366: 565-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). The diagram displays the position of the α2(Arg-274) residue that is the primary focus of this study and is located within the predicted short extracellular loop between TM2 and TM3. The function of the TM2–TM3 loop in GABAA-R subunits is currently unknown, but the corresponding region of the Gly-R α subunit has been proposed to influence the efficiency of agonist-induced gating (10Rajendra S. Schofield P.R. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 80-82Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A partial sequence alignment of Gly-R α1 compared with GABAA-R α2, β1, and γ2 subunits (Fig. 1 B) illustrates the similarity between the amino acid sequences in the TM2–TM3 loop within the group of receptor subunits. We therefore predicted that mutations in this region of the GABAA-R will produce similar effects on receptor gating. GABAA-R amino acid residues α2(Arg-274), α2(Leu-277), and α2(Lys-279) are homologous to the residues in the Gly-R α1 subunit that alter the glycine EC50 when mutated (Arg-271 (11Laube B. Langosch D. Betz H. Schmieden V. Neuroreport. 1995; 6: 897-900Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), Leu-274 (12Lynch J.W. Rajendra S. Pierce K.D. Handford C.A. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), and Lys-276 (13Lewis T.M. Sivilotti L.G. Colquhoun D. Gardiner R.M. Schoepfer R. Rees M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1998; 507: 25-40Crossref Scopus (96) Google Scholar); Fig. 1 B, boldface residues). R271Q, R271L, and K276E are naturally occurring point mutations that dramatically reduce glycine receptor sensitivity to agonist and are associated with the human neurological disorder hereditary hyperekplexia. These mutations increase the EC50 and reduce the maximal response of the glycine receptor agonists taurine and β-alanine, although the mutations do not alter the binding of the competitive glycine receptor antagonist [3H]strychnine (12Lynch J.W. Rajendra S. Pierce K.D. Handford C.A. Barry P.H. Schofield P.R. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 110-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To explore whether these conserved arginine residues in the GABAA-R play a role in receptor function, we mutated each of the homologous arginines to alanine and determined the resulting GABA EC50 (also known as potency or apparent affinity). In addition, we performed an alanine scan of the TM2–TM3 loop to identify other residues in the α subunit that may be important for GABAA-R function. Finally, we measured the effects of selected mutations on the maximal response (relative efficacy) of piperidine-4-sulfonic acid (P4S) relative to GABA. RESULTSA comparis"

Mutations in any of the GC boxes decreased efficient transcription from this promoter in MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells. The overexpression of Sp1 or Sp3 protein enhanced the rat SR-BI promoter activity. These results indicate that Sp1 family members of transcription factors are essential for transcription of the rat SR-BI gene. low density lipoprotein high density lipoprotein scavenger receptor class B type I apolipoprotein pregnant mare serum gonadotropin steroidogenic factor 1 steroidogenic acute regulatory protein base pair(s) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis polymerase chain reaction mutant electrophoretic mobility shift assay cytomegalovirus Steroidogenic tissue cells require cholesterol to support the synthesis of steroid hormones. Cholesterol, for steroidogenesis purposes, is preferentially supplied from circulating lipoproteins. Both low density lipoproteins (LDL)1 and high density lipoproteins (HDL) are capable of delivering cholesterol to support steroidogenesis, and the relative contributions of these two lipoproteins differ among species. HDL is the major source of cholesterol for steroidogenesis in rodents, whereas the well known LDL receptor pathway is generally believed to be important in humans. The cellular metabolism of LDL particles occurs primarily via the LDL receptor, as well as other members of the LDL receptor family (1.Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L.

Cell Biol. 1985; 1: 1-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (1114) Google Scholar). It is also noteworthy that cholesterol uptake from HDL is considered to be selective in that the uptake of cholesterol ester is independent of HDL internalization (4.Glass C. Pittman R.C. Weinstein D.B. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 5435-5439Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 5.Glass C. Pittman R.C. Civen M. Steinberg D. J. Biol.

Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) is the protein that mediates the selective uptake of lipids from HDL. SR-BI is a member of the CD36 family (7.Acton S.L. Scherer P.E. Lodish H.F. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21003-21009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and was found to bind a broad spectrum of ligands, including both modified and native lipoproteins, as well as anionic phospholipids (8.Rigotti A. Acton S.L. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16221-16224Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). The binding of HDL to SR-BI has been shown to be mediated by the major apolipoproteins, apoA-I, apoA-II, and apoC-III (9.Xu S. Laccotripe M. Huang X. Rigotti A. Zannis V.I. Krieger M. J. Lipid Res. 1997; 38: 1289-1298Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has been shown that the selective uptake of HDL cholesterol ester is solely dependent on the expression of SR-BI (10.Fluiter K. van Berkel T.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 515-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). SR-BI is expressed in the steroidogenic organs and liver, which all display a selective uptake of HDL cholesterol ester (6.Acton S. Rigotti A. Landschulz K.T. Xu S. Hobbs H.H. Krieger M. Science. 1996; 271: 518-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar, 11.Landschulz K.T. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 21001-21004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). SR-BI expression is coordinately regulated with the steroidogenesis by adrenocorticotropic hormone (13.Rigotti A. Edelman E.R. Seifert P. Iqbal S.N. DeMattos R.B. Temel R.E. Krieger M. Williams D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33545-33549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Studies on homozygous null SR-BI knockout mice showed that SR-BI is also required for maintaining normal development of the oocyte and for female fertility (14.Trigatti B. Rayburn H. Viñals M. Braun A. Miettinen H. Penman M. Hertz M. Schrenzel M. Amigo L. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 9322-9327Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), suggesting that SR-BI plays a critical role in female reproduction. In addition, we and other investigators have shown that the expression of SR-BI mRNA in the immature rat ovary is rapidly induced in the theca interna cells by pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) or human chorionic gonadotropin and that expression was also observed in the corpus luteum of the adult rat ovary (11.Landschulz K.T. Pathak R.K. Rigotti A. Krieger M. Hobbs H.H. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 984-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar, 15.Mizutani T. Sonoda Y. Minegishi T. Wakabayashi K. Miyamoto K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 499-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). These observations support the conclusion that SR-BI serves as a selective mediator of cholesterol uptake for steroid hormone synthesis and plays an important role in female reproduction. The regulation of the tissue-specific expression of SR-BI as well as the mechanism by which tropic hormones up-regulate this expression remains largely unknown. In this study, in order to elucidate the molecular mechanism of transcriptional regulation of SR-BI gene, we isolated and characterized the promoter region of the rat SR-BI gene. Our results indicate that the region from −121 to −90 upstream of the SR-BI transcription start site is essential for the expression of the rat SR-BI gene. The DNA sequences within the region to which protein binding occurs were characterized and shown to have homology to the consensus binding site for the three-zinc finger transcription factor, Sp1, which binds to the GC-rich sequences (16.Lania L. Majello B. De Luca P. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1313-1323Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that Sp1 binds to three sites within the region of the rat SR-BI gene promoter. Mutations in these sequences abrogate Sp1 binding and blunt the activity of the SR-BI promoter. These data suggest that Sp1 plays an important role in conferring promoter activity of the rat SR-BI gene. Sp1 is ubiquitously expressed and required for the constitutive and inducible expression of a variety of genes. To date, three Sp1-related proteins have been identified, namely Sp2, Sp3, and Sp4. Among these, Sp1 and Sp3 are thought to be important for the expression of various genes in mammalian tissues (17.Philipsen S. Suske G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 2991-3000Crossref PubMed Scopus (534) Google Scholar). In this study, relationships of Sp3 as well as Sp1 for the gene expression of SR-BI were also examined. The DNA walking kit and the GC-melt were purchased from CLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). The dual luciferase reporter assay system, the pGEM-T Easy vector, the Sp1 oligonucleotide, and the pGL3-Basic and pRL-SV vectors were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). The cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter/enhancer-directed expression vector, pcDNA3, was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). The QIAGEN plasmid kit was purchased from QIAGEN (Hilden, Germany). Fugene-6 was obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals, and the dRhodamine Terminator Cycle Sequencing FS Ready Reaction Kit was purchased from Applied Biosystems. [γ-32P]ATP (111TBq/mmol) was from NEN Life Science Products. The anti-Sp1 (SC-420X) and the anti-Sp3 (SC-644X) antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The Superscript II reverse transcriptase was from Life Technologies, Inc. The protein assay kit was purchased from Bio-Rad. PMSG was a product from Teikokuzouki, Inc. (Tokyo, Japan). The DNA walking kit (CLONTECH) was used for the isolation of the 5′-upstream DNA fragment of the rat SR-BI gene. Briefly, samples of rat genomic DNA were separately digested with five different restriction enzymes, which recognize six base pairs and produce blunt ends. The digested DNA fragments were then separately adapter-ligated to produce five sets of DNA fragments with adapters at their ends. Each set of DNA fragments was amplified using an adapter-specific 5′-primer (GTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC) and a rat SR-BI gene-specific 3′-primer (ACGGAGGCCACAGAGATGACAGAAA). Second PCR reaction was done using nested primers (the 5′-primer, ACTATAGGGCACGCGTGGT; and the 3′-primer, AGCAGCAAGGTGTGTGCCTGACAGT). In order to effectively amplify the GC-rich sequences in the upstream region of the rat SR-BI gene, GC-melt (CLONTECH) was added to the PCR reaction mixture. The PCR products from each set were analyzed on a 1% agarose gel. Two different sets showed major PCR products corresponding to 2.3 and 0.8 kilobase pairs, respectively. These products were cloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). The nucleotide sequences of two independent clones from each PCR product were determined from both ends by the dye terminator cycle sequencing method using an automated DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer model 377). An oligonucleotide with a sequence in exon 1 (5′-ACGGAGGCCACAGAGATGACAGAAA) was used as a primer for the extension reaction. The primer was end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-32P]ATP at 37 °C for 30 min. Total RNA was prepared by the acid guanidium thiocyanate extraction method (18.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63184) Google Scholar) from immature rat ovaries primed with 30 IU of PMSG for 6 h or from immature rat lung and adrenal gland. The 32P-labeled primer (lane 1, 100,000 cpm; lane 2, 20,000 cpm; lane 3, 50,000 cpm; lane 4, 100,000 cpm) was mixed with (lanes 2–4) or without (lane 1) 15 μg of total RNA in 20 μl of hybridization buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm KCl) and denatured at 65 °C for 1 h, after which the mixture was slowly cooled to room temperature. Similarly 15 μg of yeast tRNA (lane 5), 15 μg of total RNA from rat lung (lane 6), or 15 μg of total RNA from rat adrenal gland (lane 7) were mixed with the32P-labeled primer (200,000 cpm), and further reactions were performed. After the addition of 80 μl of reverse transcription reaction mixture (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 90 mmKCl, 12 mm MgCl2, 12 mmdithiothreitol, 0.6 mm each dNTP, 0.2 mmspermidine, and 400 units of Superscript II reverse transcriptase), the reaction was continued at 37 °C for 1 h. The extended transcripts were recovered after RNA digestion with RNase A by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, and were resolved on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. M13mp18 DNA ladders were co-electrophoresed in adjacent lanes as size markers, and the resulting gel was then dried and autoradiographed. Rat SR-BI promoters containing various 5′ ends were generated by PCR using the longest rat SR-BI promoter (2.3 kilobase pairs in size) as a template. Primers used for PCR are shown in Table I. Promoter DNA fragments containing substituted nucleotide sequences, namely mut 1, mut 2, mut 3, mut 12, and mut 13, were also generated by PCR using primers with the indicated nucleotide substitutions (Table I). All of the luciferase constructs contain pGL3-Basic Vector, which lacks both elements of the eukaryotic promoter and enhancer sequences, and mutant DNA fragments, which contain the same SR-BI promoter and enhancer region (−141/+13) with different point mutations. The promoter DNA fragments of mut 23 and mut 123 were generated by means of the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The numbering of the nucleotides is relative to the transcription start site (+1). All the 5′ primers contained the NheI site. A HindIII site was involved in the 3′-primer for mut 2 and mut 3. As a result, the PCR products of mut 2 and mut 3 were digested withNheI/HindIII and subcloned intoNheI/HindIII sites of the pGL3-Basic Vector. For the generation of luciferase constructs of mut 1, mut 12, and mut 13, on the other hand, −40/+13 SR-BI promoter region was initially removed from the PCR products of mut 1, mut 12, and mut 13 by using aSmaI site at −40. Then the digested products were ligated with the pGL3-Basic Vector containing −40/+13 SR-BI promoter region, resulting in the luciferase constructs, which contain the same SR-BI enhancer and promoter regions as those of wild type, mut 2, or mut 3 luciferase constructs. The vector which contains the −40/+13 SR-BI promoter region was generated by removing theNheI/SmaI fragment from the wild type reporter containing −141/+13 SR-BI promoter region. All reporter plasmids were authenticated by DNA sequencing. pCMV-Sp1, pCMV-Sp3, pPac-Sp1, and pPac-USp3 vectors were generous gifts from Dr. Guntram Suske (Philipps-Universitaet Marburg, Marburg, Germany).Table INucleotide sequences of oligonucleotides used for PCRLuciferase vectorUpper primerLower primerSR2170luc5′-gagagctagcTCCTCCTGGGTCACATAGAA5′-gagaagcttGCCAGAGCAGCAGTAGCCCTSR978luc5′-gagagctagcCTATCCTTTGTGTCCTGAGT5′-gagaagcttGCCAGAGCAGCAGTAGCCCTSR416luc5′-gagagctagcTGAGTGGAGGGTGTGCATGG5′-gagaagcttGCCAGAGCAGCAGTAGCCCTSR141luc5′-gagagctagcACATAGGCCACGCCCACGCCT5′-gagaagcttGCCAGAGCAGCAGTAGCCCTSR121luc5′-gagagctagcTCACCATCAGAGCACCGCCCACT5′-gagaagcttGCCAGAGCAGCAGTAGCCCTSR90luc5′-gagagctagcTTTCCCACCCCTAGCCGGAAT5′-gagaagcttGCCAGAGCAGCAGTAGCCCTmut 15′-gagagctagcACATAGGCCACGCCCACGCCT5′-gagaCCCGGGCAGCAAGCCCCCGTGTTmut 25′-gagagctagcACATAGGCCACGCCCACGCCT5′-gagaagcttGCCAGAGCAGCAGTAGCCCTCACCATCAGAGCACCGCCCACTCCCCGAATTTTCmut 35′-gagagctagcACATAGGCCACGCCCACGCCT5′-gagaagcttGCCAGAGCAGCAGTAGCCCTCACCATCAGAGCACCGAACACTCmut 125′-gagagctagcACATAGGCCACGCCCACGCCT5′-gagaCCCGGGCAGCAAGCCCCCGTGTTCACCATCAGAGCACCGCCCACTCCCCGAATTTTCmut 135′-gagagctagcACATAGGCCACGCCCACGCCT5′-gagaCCCGGGCAGCAAGCCCCCGTGTTCACCATCAGAGCACCGAACACTCMutated bases are underlined.

HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Cells were dispensed into 24-well plates and cultured until reaching 70% confluence. DNA samples which contained each reporter plasmid and pRL Renilla luciferase control vector (for normalization) with or without an expression plasmid (SF-1pcDNA3, pCMV-Sp1, or pCMV-Sp3) were mixed with 1.5 μl of FuGENE 6 (Roche), and the resulting mixture was added to the cells. The total amount of DNA (μg) was adjusted by adding the pcDNA3 plasmid if any. Cells were harvested 48 h later, and luciferase activity was determined using a Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay System. Measurements were made using a Lumat LB9501 luminometer (Berthold) in a single tube, with the first assay from firefly luciferase followed by the Renilla luciferase assay. Firefly luciferase activities (relative light units) were normalized byRenilla luciferase activities. Schneider line 2 (SL2) cells, a Drosophila cell line, were a generous gift from Dr. Noguchi (Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan). SL2 cells were grown in Schneider's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 25 °C. DNA transfection to SL2 cells was carried out by a calcium-phosphate method (19.Di Nocera P.P. Dawid I.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7095-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells/60-mm dish on day 0. On day 1, the cells were transfected with 2 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid and indicated amount of pPac-Sp1 or pPac-USp3 expression plasmid. Total DNA amount was adjusted by the addition of the pPac plasmid. The culture medium was not changed before or after the addition of DNA. Cells were harvested 48 h after the transfection, and cell lysates were assayed. Protein concentrations were determined according to the method reported by Bradford (20.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216377) Google Scholar) using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagents. Bovine γ-globulin was used as a standard. Firefly luciferase activity was measured with cell lysates containing equal amount of proteins. Nuclei from MA-10 cells were prepared by the method of Hagenbuchle and Wellauer (21.Hagenbuchle O. Schibler U. Petrucco S. Van Tuyle G.C. Wellauer P.K. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) with minor modifications (22.Yamada K. Tanaka T. Noguchi T. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 917-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). All operations were carried out at 4 °C. MA-10 cells were homogenized in a glass Dounce homogenizer in 5 volumes of buffer A (15 mmHepes/KOH, pH 7.8, 60 mm KCl, 15 mm NaCl, 14 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.15 mm spermine, 0.5 mm spermidine, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.2% Nonidet P40) containing 0.3 m sucrose. The homogenate was layered on top of a cushion of 0.9 msucrose in buffer A and centrifuged at 2,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The precipitated crude nuclei were resuspended in buffer A containing 0.9 m sucrose and re-centrifuged. The resulting pellet was resuspended in buffer A and centrifuged again at 2,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The preparation of a nuclear extract from a sample of pure nuclei was performed by the method of Frain et al. with minor modifications. Briefly, pure nuclei were resuspended in 5 volumes of buffer B (20 mm Hepes/NaOH, pH 7.9, 420 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10% glycerol) using a Dounce homogenizer, gently stirred with a magnetic stirrer on ice for 45 min, and then centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 15 min. 0.01 volume of 10% Nonidet P40 was added to the supernatant, and the resulting suspension was gently stirred on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 27,000 ×g for 5 min. The clear supernatant was dialyzed twice for 2 h against 50 volumes of buffer C (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10% glycerol) containing 0.1 m KCl. The dialysate was centrifuged at 27,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove the insoluble materials. Protein concentrations of the supernatant were determined using the protein assay kit. A nuclear extract (2.5 μg of proteins) was incubated for 30 min with a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide (0.1 ng) and 1 μg of poly(dA-dT) in buffer C. In the competition experiments, a 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor DNAs was added. A supershift assay was carried out by preincubating the nuclear extracts for 30 min with 1 μl of anti-Sp1 or anti-Sp3 antibodies. After the binding reaction, the mixture was subject to PAGE (4% gel) in 45 mm Tris, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mmEDTA at 200 V for 60 min and, following this, the gel was dried and exposed to Kodak XAR film. The 5′ upstream region of the rat SR-BI gene was isolated using the PCR-based DNA walking kit. Two PCR products (2.3 and 0.8 kilobase pairs in size) were obtained from rat genomic libraries. Since the 5′ upstream region of the rat SR-BI gene is quite rich in GC, the GC-melt kit was used to isolate the PCR products. In the absence of the GC-melt, no PCR product was amplified by the DNA walking kit procedure. The two DNA fragments were ligated into the pGEM-T Easy vector for sequencing. Sequence analysis revealed that the two DNA fragments differ only in their length at their 5′-regions. Fig.1 shows the nucleotide sequence of the longer fragment. To determine the transcription start site for rat SR-BI gene, a primer extension analysis was performed. An end-labeled oligonucleotide primer, which is complementary to the 5′-untranslated region of rat SR-BI mRNA, was used. Total RNA from immature rat ovaries primed with 30 IU of PMSG for 6 h was used for the extension reaction. A radiolabeled product was detected in samples containing the RNA from the ovary and adrenal gland, where strong SR-BI gene expression is observed, whereas no product was detected in samples containing yeast tRNA or RNA from lung. The primer produced an extension fragment, which contained 67 nucleotides (Fig.2), indicating that the start site for the transcription is located 128 bp upstream of the translation start site (Fig. 1).Figure 2Determination of the transcription start site by primer extension analysis. 32P-Labeled primer (lane 1, 100,000 cpm; lane 2, 20,000 cpm; lane 3, 50,000 cpm;lane 4, 100,000 cpm) was mixed with (lanes 2–4) or without (lane 1) 15 μg of total RNA prepared from immature rat ovaries primed with PMSG. Lanes 5–7 contain the32P-labeled primer (200,000 cpm) and 15 μg of yeast tRNA (lane 5), 15 μg of total RNA from lung (lane 6), and 15 μg of total RNA from adrenal gland, respectively. The primer was extended with 400 units of reverse transcriptase at 37 °C for 1 h. Extension products were resolved on an 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. A dideoxy sequence ladder is shown next to the extension products for size determination. The number corresponds to the number of bases 5′ of the start of translation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The sequence contains a number of putative transcription factor binding sites. A potential TATA boxlike sequence was present about 30 bp upstream from the transcription start site. The sequence is particularly rich in guanine and cytosine residues and contains four Sp1/Sp3 transcription factor consensus elements. As a first step in determining the sequence required for transcriptional activity of the rat SR-BI gene, a series of plasmids was prepared. These plasmids contained upstream fragments of −2170/+13(SR2170luc), −978/+13(SR978luc), −416/+13(SR416luc), −141/+13(SR141luc), −121/+13(SR121luc), −90/+13 (SR90luc), −40/+13 (SR40luc), respectively, which were placed upstream of the luciferase reporter gene. The plasmids were transiently transfected into MA-10 cells, and the reporter activity determined. As shown in Fig.3, SR2170luc has an activity about 50% lower than SR978luc, SR416luc, SR141luc, and SR121luc constructs. This may correspond to the presence of a silencer activity between −2170 and −978. Fig. 3 also shows that deletion of −121 to −90 dramatically decreased activity (less than 2% of the activity of the wild type promoter, SR141luc). These data strongly suggest that the region between −121 and −90 is important for the positive regulation of rat SR-BI expression. This region contains two GC boxes, which are compatible with putative Sp1 binding sites (GC box 2 and GC box 3). Removal of the most proximal Sp1 site (GC box 1), between −90 and −40, essentially abolished promoter activity. Although the 5′-deletion analysis suggests that Sp1 family transcription factors regulate SR-BI promoter activity, this does not directly address the roles of the GC boxes relative to SR-BI expression. As a result, we individually and combinatorially mutated the three GC boxes within the SR141luc reporter construct. As shown in Fig. 4, mutations in any one of the GC boxes resulted in only 20–35% of the activity relative to the wild type promoter SR141luc. mut 13 (mutated in both GC boxes 1 and 3) caused a further decrease in activity to 8% of the control value. mut 12 (mutated in both GC boxes 1 and 2) and mut 23 (mutated in both GC boxes 2 and 3) did not result in any further decrease compared with those of mut 1 (mutated in GC box 1) and mut 3 (mutated in GC box 3), respectively. These results suggest that each GC box is required for a high level of SR-BI expression. To determine if nuclear proteins are capable of specifically binding to these sites, EMSAs were performed using nuclear extracts from MA-10 cells. For these experiments, radiolabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to −121/−86 (containing GC boxes 2 and 3) and −61/−40 (containing GC box 1) of the rat SR-BI promoter were used with or without an added 200-fold molar excess of unlabeled −121/−86 or −61/−40 oligonucleotide, or those encoding canonical Sp1-binding (23.Kadonaga J.T. Carner K.R. Masiarz F.R. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 51: 1079-1090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1251) Google Scholar) and NF-Y-binding (24.Maity S.N. de Crombrugghe B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 174-178Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) consensus sequences. As shown in Fig. 5, four major complexes were formed with the −121/−86 probe (lane 1) and two major complexes were formed with the −61/−40 probe (lane 9). The formation of these complexes were prevented by the addition of an excess of the unlabeled homologous probes as well as the Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide (lanes 2 and 3 and lanes 10 and11), but not by an unrelated probe, such as the NF-Y consensus oligonucleotide (lanes 5 and13). When the radiolabeled −121/−86 probe was used, an excess of unlabeled −61/−40 oligonucleotide partially prevented the complex formation. When the radiolabeled −61/−40 probe (lane 4) was used, excess unlabeled −121/−86 oligonucleotide almost completely prevented complex formation (lane 12). We next examined the effects of mutations at the two GC boxes (GC box 2 and GC box 3) where Sp1 binds. With the use of radiolabeled −121/−86 probe, excess amounts of neither mut 3 nor mut 23 (Table II) were effective in preventing complex formation, whereas mut 2 was partially effective. This suggests that the GC box 3 p"

We have detected protein conformational alterations following light absorption by retinal-based chromophores in the bacteriorhodopsin binding site by monitoring the rate of reduction-oxidation reactions of covalently attached spin labels, using EPR spectroscopy. It was found that the reduction reaction with hydroxylamine is light-catalyzed in the A103C-labeled pigment but not in E74C or M163C. The reaction is light-catalyzed even when isomerization of the C13=C14 bond of the retinal chromophore is prevented. The reverse oxidation reaction with molecular oxygen is effective only in apomembrane derived from the mutant A103C. This reaction is light-accelerated following light absorption of the retinal oxime, which occupies the binding site. The light-induced acceleration is evident also in “locked” bacteriorhodopsin in which isomerization around the C13=C14 bond is prevented. It is evident that the chromophore-protein covalent bond is not a prerequisite for protein response. In contrast to the case of the retinal oxime, a reduced C=N bond A103C-labeled pigment did not exhibit acceleration of the oxidation reaction following light absorption. Acceleration was observed, however, following substitution of the polyene by groups that modify the excited state charge delocalization.

It is composed of seven transmembrane helices enclosing the binding pocket for an all-trans-retinal chromophore, which is bound to Lys216 via a protonated Schiff base (SBH)+. Absorption of a photon by the retinal induces an all-trans→ 13-cis isomerization, which initiates a photocycle with several distinct spectroscopic intermediates, J625, K590, L550, M412, N560, and O640. It is well established that the retinal in K590 is characterized by a 13-cis configuration (4,5). Deprotonation of the protonated Schiff base takes place during the L to M transition, which is accompanied by protonation of Asp85 and the appearance of a proton at the extracellular surface. The Schiff base is reprotonated during the M to N transition from the proton donor Asp96, which is finally reprotonated from the cytoplasmic side during the recovery initial state of bR. It is widely assumed that all light-induced protein conformational alterations in retinylidine proteins, including bR, are initiated by isomerization of the retinal chromophore. However, alternative approaches have been suggested in which isomerization is not the only trigger for biological activity or protein structural alterations (6.Salem L. Brackmann P. Nature. 1975; 258: 526-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). One approach attributed protein conformational alterations to large charge redistribution in the retinal chromophore developed following light absorption (7.Lewis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 543-547Google Scholar, 8.Delaney J. Brack T. Atkinson G. Ottolenghi M. Steinberg G. Sheves M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In keeping with these suggestions, we have recently shown, using atomic force sensing (AFS), that protein conformational alterations are induced in bR following light absorption, even when the crucial C13=C14double bond isomerization is prevented by a rigid ring structure (10.Rousso I. Khachatryan E. Gat Y. Brodsky I. Ottolenghi M. Sheves M. Lewis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7937-7941Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Thus, the data bring into question (providing direct experimental results) the hypothesis that all primary events in retinal proteins are due to an initial trans → cis isomerization. Furthermore, we have recently examined the light-catalyzed cleavage of the retinal-protein covalent bond by hydroxylamine (HA) (11.Rousso I. Gat Y. Lewis A. Sheves M. Ottolenghi M. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 413-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and concluded that the reaction was caused by light-induced conformational alterations, extending to a μs to ms time scale, which are not due to an optically detectable photocycle, which is associated with C13=C14 isomerization. In this work, we apply a new and independent approach, the rate of reduction-oxidation of covalently attached spin labels, to detect protein conformational changes induced by light absorption by retinal-based chromophores in the bR binding site. We have followed the site-directed spin labeling method (12.Feix Y.B. King C. Berliner L. Spin-Labeling. Plenum Press, New York1998: 251-281Google Scholar, 13.Hubbell W. Gross A. Langen R. Leitzow M.

This method was also used to determine the identity and orientation of the secondary structure of protein domains and the topography of polypeptide chains with respect to the membrane solution interface (19.Rink T.

The topography of bR was mapped using site-directed spin labeling by determining the collision rate of the nitroxide side chain with a freely diffusing paramagnetic reagent, one polar and the other nonpolar. The polar reagent is usually a chromium oxalate localized in the aqua phase, and the nonpolar is molecular oxygen localized in the lipid phase (21.Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G.

In the present study, we used site-directed spin labeling to probe light-induced conformational changes in bR and in artificial locked pigments (Scheme FS1), which were labeled with an EPR probe at positions 74 (E74C mutant) at the extracellular side and A103C and M163C at the cytoplasmic side (22.Grigorieff N.

We took advantage of the possibility to reduce the nitroxyl radical with HA (Scheme FS2), which is followed by the disappearance of the EPR signal, and of the subsequent spontaneous oxidation of the reduced radical with molecular oxygen.Figure FS2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The experimental results show that, in the case of the A103C-labeled mutant, the reduction of nitroxyl radical with HA is light-sensitive even when the C13=C14 bond is locked to isomerization. We have also studied the intriguing question as to the necessity of the retinal-opsin covalent bond for protein response. It has been shown previously that a pigment devoid of a retinal-opsin C=N bond is formed upon reconstitution of K216A (29.Schweiger U. Tittor J. Oesterhelt D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) and K216G (30.Friedman N. Druckmann S. Lanyi J. Needleman R. Lewis A. Ottolenghi M. Sheves M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1971-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) mutants with all-trans-retinal Schiff bases. Moreover, this noncovalent bound chromophore exhibits a photocycle analogous to that of native bR. In the present study, we have detected protein response to light absorption of retinal oxime, which occupies the binding site but does not covalently bind to the protein. The response was also detected in “locked” chromophores in which isomerization around the C13=C14 bond cannot take place. In variance with the retinal oxime system, a reduced Schiff base chromophore does not exhibit a light-induced oxidation reaction of the spin label. However, such a reaction is observed upon asymmetrically substituting the polyene with groups that modify the excited state charge delocalization. The spin label (1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethylpyrroline-3-methyl)methanethiosulfonate (MTSSL in dimethyl sulfoxide; Toronto Research Chemicals, Canada) was covalently attached to the cysteine residue of the appropriate bR mutant (A103C, M163C, or E74C) to yield the spin label side chain. A 10-μl solution of 100 mm MTSSL in dimethyl sulfoxide was diluted with a 2-ml suspension of 50 μm bR mutant in 0.1m phosphate buffer (pH 8) and 0.1M NaCl. The suspensions were stirred at room temperature for 14 h. The noncovalently bound spin label was removed by washing the membrane pellet four times with a solution of 1% bovine serum albumin. The EPR spectra of the spin-labeled bR was measured to estimate the extent of labeling and to assure removal of nonbound spin label. Retinal analogs were prepared as described previously (32.Fan J. Cariker J. Balogh-Nair V. Nakanishi K. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1983; 105: 5162-5163Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 33.Sheves M. Friedman N. Albeck A. Ottolenghi M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 1260-1265Crossref Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The 103C apomembrane was prepared from the A103C mutant pigment according to an established method (34.Oesterhelt D. Stoeckenius W. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 31: 667-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (1594) Google Scholar). This apomembrane was incubated with 1.2 equivalents of the appropriate retinal analog (Scheme FS1) at pH 7 for 3 days with retinal analog 2 and 12 h for analogs3 and 4. The artificial pigments derived from A103C mutant were spin-labeled as described above to yield the 103 spin label side chain. The spin label in bR mutants (A103C, M163C, and E74C) or in the appropriate artificial pigment (Scheme FS1, II, derived from analog 2) was reduced by the addition of 0.2 m HA at pH 7 to a 70 μm solution of the pigment suspension (Scheme FS2). The reduction reaction was monitored by the disappearance of the central component of the EPR spectrum. Experiments were carried out in the dark or under illumination with a halogen lamp with an output of 150 W equipped with a heat-absorbing filter and a 510-nm glass cut-off filter. Illumination was kept steady for the whole experiment. Spin-labeled bR and the artificial pigments (Scheme FS1, II, III, and IV, derived from analogs 2–4) were bleached to produce the apomembrane by mixing 1 m HA at pH 7 with 15 μm pigment suspension. The suspension was illuminated with a 150-watt halogen lamp using a 510-nm cut-off filter and was monitored by the disappearance of the main absorption band (570 nm for II and III and 550 nm for IV). The spin label was completely reduced during the reaction (Scheme FS2), faster than the pigment bleaching process as described above. The HA was removed by washing the pellet four times with water. The oxidation reaction by molecular oxygen took place spontaneously following HA removal (Scheme FS3), and the reaction was monitored by following the increase in the central component of the EPR spectra. Experiments were carried out in the dark and under blue light illumination with a window filter (360 nm < λmax < 420 nm). The initial EPR signal intensity prior to illumination was relatively high due to spontaneous oxidation of the spin label in the dark, which took place during the sample preparation HA treatment (∼2 h). A103C bR mutant was bleached to produce the apomembrane. Artificial pigments were prepared by incubating 1.2 equivalents of the retinal analogs (SchemeFS1) with A103C apomembrane at 25 °C pH 7. The Schiff-base bond of wild type bR and of the artificial pigments was reduced by Sodium borohydride to produce the polyene chain covalently bound to the protein. The reaction was carried out under illumination with a 510-nm cut-off filter and was monitored by the disappearance of the main absorption peak of each pigment. The sodium borohydride was removed by washing the membrane pellet with water four times. The reduced pigments were spin-labeled as described above, and the membrane pellet was washed four times with a solution of 1% bovine serum albumin. The spin-labeled reduced pigments were incubated for 30 min with 0.5 m HA in the dark to reduce the spin label side chain. The HA was removed by washing the membrane pellet four times with water followed by EPR measurements to monitor the spontaneous oxidation of the reduced spin label. The reaction was monitored by following the increase in the central component of the EPR spectra in the dark and under illumination using white light with a 310-nm cut-off filter. All measurements were performed on a Bruker D-SRC, ER 200 spectrometer, using a flat cell (volume 60 μl) at 23 °C. Conditions were as follows: center of field, 3500 gauss; modulation amplitude, 1.0 gauss; microwave power, 20 milliwatts; receiver gain, 3 × 105 to 8 × 105. The kinetics were measured by monitoring the central component at a fixed position. It was previously shown (35.Nettleton D. Morse P. Swartz H. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 271: 414-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) that nitroxide spin labels can be easily reduced by hydroxylamine (HA) and are reoxidized by molecular oxygen following exposure to air. Bacteriorhodopsin was labeled with a nitroxyl radical at positions 103 and 164 in the cytoplasmic side and 74 in the extracellular surface of the protein by reaction of the appropriate mutants with MTSSL in dimethyl sulfoxide. HA was added to the protein, and the reduction of the radical was monitored by a decrease in the peak intensity of the central component of the EPR spectra. The rotational correlation times for the spin labels of 74, 103, and 164 were 8 × 10−10 s, 10−8 s, and 3 × 10−9 s, correspondingly, as calculated according to the method described in Ref. 36.Roozen M. Hemminga M. J. Phys. Chem. 1990; 94: 7326-7329Crossref Scopus (50) Google Scholar. The reaction rate was followed in the dark and under illumination with light, which is absorbed exclusively by the retinal chromophore. The reaction was carried out in the presence of a relatively low concentration of HA (0.2 m), which was sufficient to reduce the radical without significant bleaching of the pigment (5% bleaching was measured following illumination with a 510-nm cut-off filter). We found that, for labeled bR at position 103 in the cytoplasmic side, the reaction was accelerated by light ∼1.5 times, relative to the dark under the conditions used in the experiments (Fig.1). The reaction in the A103C-labeled system was further carried out in an artificial “locked” pigment derived from chromophore 2(Scheme FS1), in which isomerization around the C13=C14 double bond is prevented. It was found that the reaction rate was accelerated by light by a factor of 1.4, similar to the extent of acceleration detected in the labeled native bR. In contrast to labeling at Cys103, labeled mutants E74C and M163C did not show any observable light acceleration of the reduction rate. Removal of the hydroxylamine reagent did not induce spontaneous oxidation of the spin label at any of the three labeled pigments in the dark, nor following illumination. The addition of a high concentration (1 m) of HA to the A103C-labeled pigment induced two reactions. The first involves reduction of the radical (as described above), whereas the second is associated with cleavage of the protonated Schiff base linkage to produce an apomembrane in which a retinal oxime molecule replaces the covalently bound retinal in the binding site (11.Rousso I. Gat Y. Lewis A. Sheves M. Ottolenghi M. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 413-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Following removal of the HA reagent from the apomembrane, a spontaneous oxidation of the reduced radical by oxygen occurs following exposure to air, according to Scheme FS3. The oxidation reaction in native bR was monitored by an increase in the EPR signal. Its significant acceleration by illumination with blue light (360 nm < λmax < 420 nm), which is absorbed by the retinal oxime was clearly observed (Fig.2 A). In the apomembrane derived from the A103C mutant, the reaction could be accelerated as much as by a factor of 4.5 times. In contrast, we did not observe light acceleration in apomembranes derived from M163C- and E74C-labeled mutants. We note that the line width of the EPR signal did not change during the experiment, and only the peak intensity increased. This indicates that the reappearance of the EPR signal is associated with a chemical reaction that produces the nitroxyl radical (Scheme FS3) and not with environmental alterations. To support the assumption that the reaction acceleration is associated with light absorption by retinal oxime (λmax = 360 nm), we irradiated the sample with a 460-nm cut-off filter but did not detect the reaction acceleration, in keeping with the assumption that the acceleration is associated with light absorption by the retinal oxime chromophore. The oxidation reaction was also investigated with A103C-labeled apomembranes prepared from artificial labeled pigments derived from analogs 2, 3, and 4 (Scheme FS1, Fig.3). All three artificial pigments are characterized by a C13=C14 double bond “locked” by a rigid ring structure. Although isomerization of this “critical” bond is now precluded, the label oxidation rates of all three “apo-locked” pigments were found to be accelerated by light absorption of the retinal oxime. The effects were comparable with those of the native pigments. As summarized in TableI, under the same illumination conditions, apo-locked cis (III) was accelerated 6 times, apo-locked trans (II) 5.5 times, and apo-locked furan (IV) 4.4 times.Table IAcceleration by light of the spin label reduction (by hydroxylamine) and oxidation (by O2)SystemLight accelerationReductionOxidation103C a0.2 m HA, λ > 510 nm.

The oxidation reaction rate still accelerated although illumination was stopped, and it gradually diminished in ∼5 min, returning to the original rate, as measured under dark conditions. This “postillumination effect” (Fig. 2 B) was observed in all of the labeled apomembrane samples that were studied. To obtain further insight into the origin of the light-catalyzed oxidation and to evaluate the possibility that light-induced conformational alterations in the protein are associated with light-induced retinal charge redistribution, we carried out experiments in systems in which the light-induced dipole in the polyene is substantially modified. In view of the critical role played by the protonated Schiff base in generating the AFS signals attributed to the light-induced dipole (10.Rousso I. Khachatryan E. Gat Y. Brodsky I. Ottolenghi M. Sheves M. Lewis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7937-7941Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we worked with systems in which the C=N bond was reduced with sodium borohydride, followed by labeling of the appropriate cysteine residue with a nitroxyl radical. In the reduced system, the retinal polyene is practically symmetrical, and, as suggested by the lack of light-induced Atomic Force Sensing (AFS) signal (10.Rousso I. Khachatryan E. Gat Y. Brodsky I. Ottolenghi M. Sheves M. Lewis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7937-7941Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and by Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) studies, 2A. Lewis, A. Khachatryan, I. Rousso, and M. Sheves, unpublished results. it is devoid of a significantly induced dipole. The C=N reduced labeled protein was subjected to HA (0.1 m) treatment, which reduced the radical. Oxidation of the reduced radical (following HA removal) was monitored in the dark and under illumination. In contrast to the case of retinal oxime, exposure of the reduced retinal chromophore of the A103C-labeled pigment to white light did not induce any acceleration of the oxidation reaction (Fig.4 A). The effect of light on the oxidation rate of the reduced radical was further examined in three groups of labeled and reduced artificial pigments. The first group included reduced pigments substituted by electron-withdrawing or -donating groups located in the vicinity of the covalent linkage to the protein. Two reduced pigments were examined: 14-F (V) and 13-CF3 (VI), which are electron-withdrawing groups (Scheme FS4). The oxidation reaction of the 14-F analog was accelerated 6-fold by light, and the 13-CF3 was 5 times faster (Fig. 4 B). The second group of reduced pigments is characterized by substituents located at the opposite end of the polyene chain. The artificially reduced pigments bearing p-dimethylaminobenzene (X) and N-amine (XI) polyenes both showed light acceleration of the radical oxidation (Fig. 4 B) We interpret the above observations in terms of substituent-induced restoration of the excited state dipole, which is absent in the symmetrical, reduced chromophore of the native retinal. To further examine this conclusion, we investigated a third group of C=N reduced pigments, substituted by electron-donating groups (VII–IX) at the center of the polyene chain. Analogously to the reduced native pigment, none of these species exhibited any light effect on the oxidation reaction (Fig. 4 A). To exclude the possibility that the light acceleration oxidation reactions with reduced pigments originated from the residual retinal oxime produced during the bR bleaching reaction, we performed a control experiment with bleached bR reduced with sodium borohydride, which was labeled with the EPR probe. No light acceleration was observed. Since in these systems the retinal binding site is occupied by the covalently bound reduced polyene, this observation is in keeping with the interpretation that a light-induced effect is observed only upon excitation of oxime molecules, which are located in the retinal binding site. Chemical reactions in bR and their possible light acceleration are important tools for detecting structural changes in the protein following light absorption (11.Rousso I. Gat Y. Lewis A. Sheves M. Ottolenghi M. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 413-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). While previous studies approached this issue via the HA light-induced reactions of the Schiff base, the present work detects light-induced conformational alterations in protein domains other than the retinal binding site. This was carried out by applying the spin label redox methodology in order to explore the occurrence of light-induced protein conformational alterations, which are not initiated by isomerization of the C13=C14 double bond.

Here we have used chemical reduction reactions of the nitroxyl radical with HA and subsequent oxidation with molecular oxygen to reform the radicals as tools for probing light-induced protein conformational alterations in a variety of artificial and chemically modified chromophore systems. Among the three bR mutants studied (A103C and M163C on the cytoplasmic side and E74C on the extracellular side), only the A103C exhibited significant acceleration of the reduction reaction upon light absorption by the retinal chromophore. This effect might be related to previous observations, showing that the protein experiences conformational alterations in the 103 vicinity that are probably associated with the N photocycle intermediate (16.Steinhoff H.

Chem. 1995; 56: 89-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Moreover, in this study we found that enhancements of the spin label reduction reaction, analogous to that of the native pigment, are observed in artificial pigments derived from “locked” retinals that do not exhibit the characteristic optically detectable bR photocycle (11.Rousso I. Gat Y. Lewis A. Sheves M. Ottolenghi M. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 413-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). This indicates that certain protein conformational alterations occur in the vicinity of the 103 residue that are not essentially associated with the photocycle and therefore do not require C13=C14 double bond isomerization. A different situation prevails in the vicinity of residues 163 and 74. Apparently, the protein does not experience substantial conformational alterations around these residues following light absorption, or alternatively, such changes do occur but do not enhance the reduction reaction. We note that in contrast to A103C and M163C-labeled pigments (16.Steinhoff H. Mollaaghababa R. Altenbach C. Hideg K. Krebs M. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W. Science. 1994; 266: 105-107Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), the EPR line shape of the radical in the E74C mutant located in the extracellular surface in an interhelical loop (22.Grigorieff N.

However, the chemical reaction to form the label pigment was very slow, indicating less accessibility of the reagent. It is important to note that unlike the reduction reaction with hydroxylamine, the back-oxidation does not occur under both dark and light conditions. This is in keeping with previous work (21.Altenbach C. Greenhalgh D.A. Khorana H.G. Hubbell W.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1667-1671Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar) that indicates that position 103 and 163 mutants are not accessible to collisions with molecular oxygen, since they are located at the border between the protein and aqueous phase. Our present work indicates that oxygen accessibility is not sufficiently increased in the vicinity of these residues under light conditions. The different reactivity of the spin label probes toward hydroxylamine and oxygen can be rationalized by their different polarities, which affect their accessibility. Thus, the polar hydroxylamine reacts with the spin label probes in contrast to the apolar oxygen, reflecting a polar environment of the probes. A significant difference is observed when the oxidation reaction is investigated in the apoprotein, where the original retinal Schiff base is replaced by a retinal oxime. In this case, slow oxidation with molecular oxygen is observed in the dark for the label at the 103 residue, which is considerably accelerated following irradiation of the retinal oxime, absorbing at 360 nm. It was previously shown that retinal oxime occupies the retinal binding site and exhibits a CD signal (38.Becker B. Cassim J. Biophys. J. 1977; 19: 285-297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Moreover, AFS studies 3I. Rousso, E. Khachatryan, A. Lewis, and M. Sheves, unpublished results. detected protein conformational alterations induced by light absorption by the retinal oxime. Thus, the light-accelerated oxidation of the spin label provides further evidence that light absorption by the retinal oxime induces a protein conformational alteration, in this case an alteration that increases oxygen accessibility to the 103 region, thus allowing the oxidation reaction. It is evident that the protein conformation of the apoprotein is different from that of native bR, at least around the 103 residue, and that such differences are responsible for different oxygen accessibility to the vicinity of this residue. Furthermore, these light-induced protein conformational alterations do not require a chromophore-protein covalent bond; i.e. chromophore occupation of the binding site is sufficient for generating light-induced structural changes in the protein. This feature is reminiscent of the behavior of bacteriorhodopsin pigments lacking the retinal–Lys216 covalent bond (29.Schweiger U. Tittor J. Oesterhelt D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 535-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 30.Friedman N. Druckmann S. Lanyi J. Needleman R. Lewis A. Ottolenghi M. Sheves M. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1971-1976Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) that were prepared by reconstituting K216G and K216A mutants with retinal alkylamine Schiff bases. The pigments exhibited the basic photochemical features of native bR as well as the associated proton pumping activity. The light-induced conformational alterations prevailing in the native apomembrane that contains retinal oxime as its chromophore are also present in artificial apomembranes derived from retinal analogs2–4. In these chromophores, the isomerization around the C13=C14 double bond (in 2 and3) and around C13=C14 and C11=C12 in 4 is precluded. Thus, it is evident that such protein structural changes are not associated with isomerization of these two double bonds. Although isomerization around the C9=C10 bond cannot be definitely excluded, it seems highly unlikely in view of the comparable catalytic light effect in the case of the two trans locked chromophores (2and 4) and of the cis locked chromophore (3). Since a double cis photoproduct is highly unlikely in retinal Schiff bases (39.Freedman K. Becker R J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1986; 108: 1245-1251Crossref Scopus (133) Google Scholar), C9=C10 isomerization will not be in keeping with the comparable effects of trans and cis systems. An interesting effect is associated with the “postlight effect” (Fig. 2 B). The oxidation reaction kinetic reaches its dark value after only a few minutes following cessation of light illumination. We suggest that the oxygen remains “trapped” in the vicinity of the 103 residue for a relatively long time after the protein has retained its original conformation, due to existing barriers for the diffusion of the oxygen outside. It is concluded that a channel for oxygen connecting the 103 residue vicinity with the outside medium exists also in the dark, but light raises the affinity of the 103 residue protein vicinity to oxygen and possibly decreases the barrier for oxygen penetration. The absence of the effect of light of the oxidation reaction in mutants M163C and E74C might be explained by a lack of protein changes in these domains or by low accessibility of oxygen, even under light illumination. Reduction of the protonated Schiff base protein linkage with sodium borohydride leads to a symmetric polyene covalently bound to the protein in which significant electronic charge redistribution following light absorption can be excluded. This pigment did not show any light-catalyzed oxidation reaction. This observation is consistent with the mechanism suggested for the retinal oxime light catalysis, namely that the catalytic conformational alterations are associated with charge redistribution following light absorption. Compelling support for charge redistribution as the cause of conformational alterations is gained by experiments with substituted reduced polyenes. Substitution with withdrawing electrons (F, CF3), close to the Schiff base linkage, induced light oxidation acceleration; similarly, introducing electron-donating groups instead of the β-ionone ring initiated protein response as well. This indicates that the asymmetric electronic distribution causes a catalytic effect analogous to the oxime systems. Interestingly, no protein response could be detected in polyenes in which withdrawing or donating groups were located in the middle of the polyene chain. Finally, we note that the lack of light-catalyzed reaction in the symmetric chromophore and its presence in the substituted, asymmetric systems excludes the possibility that protein structural changes are induced by excess light energy dissipated as heat. It is tempting to relate our present results to a previously described study in which light response of bR and locked artificial pigments was monitored by AFS (10.Rousso I. Khachatryan E. Gat Y. Brodsky I. Ottolenghi M. Sheves M. Lewis A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7937-7941Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The effect detected in the locked pigments was interpreted in terms of a light-induced structural change in the protein that is not accompanied by an optical photocycle. Analogous changes may play a role in catalyzing the light-induced HA reaction (11.Rousso I. Gat Y. Lewis A. Sheves M. Ottolenghi M. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 413-417Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) of the Schiff base as well as the reactions of the probe at the Cys103 position described above. Protein conformational alterations induced by light absorption were also suggested in the process of retinal binding to apoprotein at low humidity, which was initiated by 9-cis-retinal isomerization to all-trans following light absorption (40.Rousso I. Sheves M. Lewis A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 11299-11300Crossref Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Critical cavities in the protein are opened following light absorption by all-trans-retinal (following the isomerization of 9-cis to all-trans), despite the fact that the retinal-protein complex lacks a characteristic photocycle. In conclusion, we have shown that the protein experiences conformational alterations following light absorption that are not associated with double bond isomerization but are instead due to charge redistribution developed in the retinal chromophore. A chromophore-protein covalent bond is not a prerequisite for the protein response. A future study should clarify whether a relationship exists between these conformational alterations and those detected during the bacteriorhodopsin photocycle as well as clarifying their possible importance in the bacteriorhodopsin function.

RNA polymerase ethylene glycol bis(succinic acidN-hydroxysuccinimide ester) In Escherichia coli, RNA polymerase (RNAP)1 exists in two forms: core RNAP and RNAP holoenzyme. The basic transcription machinery, core RNAP, consisting of subunits α2ββ′, is capable of transcription elongation and termination, but it is unable to initiate transcription; whereas RNAP holoenzyme, consisting of α2ββ′ς, is capable of initiating transcription from promoters on a DNA template (1.Burgess R.R.

We found that the RapA protein co-purifies with RNAP holoenzyme exclusively and that after purification to homogeneity, RapA is capable of forming a stable complex with RNAP holoenzyme in vitro (10.Sukhodolets M.V. Jin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7018-7023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In addition, the RapA protein is an ATPase, and its ATPase activity is stimulated upon binding to RNAP holoenzyme, indicating that RapA interacts with RNAP holoenzyme both physically and functionally. Independently, Muzzin et al.(19.Muzzin O. Campbell E., A. Xia L. Severinova E. Darst S.A. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15157-15161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) also reported that the same 110-kDa protein (but named HepA) is associated with RNAP in E. coli. However, they found that this new protein appeared to be associated only with core RNAP but not with RNAP holoenzyme (19.Muzzin O. Campbell E., A. Xia L. Severinova E. Darst S.A. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15157-15161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Thus, it is important to address whether and how RapA interacts with the two forms of RNAP. This is not only an unsolved issue but could also shed some light on the function of RapA. In this study, we further characterized the interaction between RNAP and the RapA protein biochemically. Specifically, we analyzed the conditions that affect the interactions between RapA and either core RNAP or RNAP holoenzyme and measured the dissociation constants (K d) of RapA-RNAP complexes. We also identified the subunits of RNAP that are in close contact with RapA by chemical cross-linking. Furthermore, in an attempt to address the cellular function of RapA, we constructed a rapA null mutation and studied the effect of this mutation in vivo. The RapA protein and RNAP were purified from E. coli K12 cells (MG1655) as described previously (10.Sukhodolets M.V. Jin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7018-7023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations were determined using the Bradford assay (20.Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. RNAP concentrations were also determined by UV absorbance using the molar extinction coefficient data of Lowe et al. (21.Lowe P.A. Hager D.A. Burgess R.R. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 1344-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). The RapA-specific and ς-70-specific polyclonal antibodies were previously described (10.Sukhodolets M.V. Jin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7018-7023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibodies specific for the α (4RA1), β (NT63), or β′ (NT73) subunits of RNAP were kindly provided by Dr. Richard Burgess (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI), and the polyclonal antibodies specific for the ω subunit of RNAP were kindly provided by Dr. Dan Gentry (SmithKline Beecham). The bifunctional cross-linker ethylene glycol bis(succinic acidN-hydroxysuccinimide ester) (EGS-NHS) was purchased from Sigma. Stability of the complex of RapA with either core RNAP or RNAP holoenzyme was studied by gel filtration using a Superose 6 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described previously (10.Sukhodolets M.V.

The samples were then spun in a SW-60 rotor for 21 h at 37,500 rpm (6 °C). Each 4-ml tube was fractionated into 13 fractions using the Beckman Fraction Recovery system. Equal volumes of 2× Laemmli sample buffer were then added to each fraction, and the samples were analyzed on SDS 10% polyacrylamide gels. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 or silver. The ATPase activities were determined by measuring the amount of [α-32P]ADP released from [α-32P]ATP. The reaction conditions and separation of samples by chromatography using poly(ethyleneimine)-cellulose plates (J.T. Baker Inc.) were as described (10.Sukhodolets M.V. Jin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7018-7023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Plates were autoradiographed using Kodak Bio-Max MR film and scanned on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) to quantitate the amount of [α-32P]ATP hydrolyzed. The ATPase activity was expressed as pmol of ATP hydrolyzed/min/μg of RapA. The stimulation of RapA ATPase activity by RNAP was used to determine the apparent K d values of RNAP-RapA complexes (Ref. 10.Sukhodolets M.V. Jin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7018-7023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar; this work). Sequential dilutions of purified RapA alone or purified RapA premixed with either purified core RNAP or RNAP holoenzyme (2 mol of RapA per 1 mol of RNAP) in binding buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 4 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 mm NaCl) were made. It was found necessary to use siliconized tubes and maintain bovine serum albumin in the buffer to eliminate nonspecific binding of proteins to the tube walls, particularly at low protein concentrations. ATPase activity of each dilution was determined and calculated as pmol of ATP hydrolyzed/min/μg of RapA (A obs). The difference between the ATPase activities of RNAP/RapA mixtures and RapA alone at each RapA concentration was calculated as ΔA obs at that particular RapA concentration. The value of ΔA max (maximal activation) was calculated from the double-reciprocal plot (1/ΔA obs versus 1/[RapA]). The ratio of ΔA obs and ΔA max was calculated and plotted as a function of RapA concentration. The apparent K d values were obtained directly from these adsorption isotherms as the RapA concentrations corresponding to half-maximal ΔA obs/ΔA max. Each titration was repeated at least twice with similar results. Purified RNAP or a 1:1 RNAP-RapA complex, typically at a final concentration of 2.6 μm, was incubated with 1 mm EGS-NHS in 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, in a final volume of 100 μl. Reactions were incubated as specified in the legends for Figs. 6 and 7 and quenched by the addition of 100 μl of 2× Laemmli sample buffer. The cross-linked protein products were analyzed by electrophoresis on SDS-5% polyacrylamide gels and subsequently silver-stained or transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.), followed by immunostaining with antibodies specific for RapA or various subunits of RNAP. Anti-rabbit and anti-mouse peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Calbiochem) were used to visualize the membrane-bound antibody-antigen complexes.Figure 7The efficiency of the cross-linking between the α and ς-70 subunits of RNAP is greatly reduced in the presence of RapA.

RNAP holoenzyme (lanes 1,2, 5, and 6) or 1:1 RNAP holoenzyme-RapA complex (lanes 3, 4,7, and 8) was incubated with EGS-NHS for 30 min as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The positions of the α and ς-70 subunits of RNAP and the cross-linked α-α and α-ς-70 complexes are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The rapA gene was cloned into the expression vector pBAD24 (22.Guzman L.M.

Bacteriol. 1995; 177 (4130): 4221Crossref Google Scholar) as follows. 1) A DNA fragment containing the rapA gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the primers DJ142 (5′-TAG CAG GAG GAA TTC ACC ATG CCT TTT ACA CTT GGT CAA CGC TGG), which contains the sequence upstream of the EcoRI site of pBAD24 and the beginning of the coding sequence for rapA, and DJ143A (5′-ACA CTT ATC AAG CTT TAT GGT CAT CCT GAT ACA GGA TAA CCA ACC A), which covers sequences about 80 base pairs downstream of therapA gene and introduces a HindIII site. 2) The amplified DNA fragment was purified, digested with the restriction enzymes EcoRI and HindIII, and ligated with the pBAD24 vector DNA, which had been digested with EcoRI andHindIII. The resulting plasmid pDJ61 (Ampr) was confirmed by restriction mapping and by arabinose induction ofrapA. In pDJ61, there are only three PvuII sites, all of which are located in the middle of the rapA gene. After the pDJ61 plasmid DNA had been digested with the restriction enzyme PvuII, the largest DNA fragment (6.5 kilobase pairs), which contained some vector sequence and parts of the rapA gene (including the coding sequence from base pairs 1–752 and base pairs 2042–2906 but deleted most of the conserved regions in the SNF2 family), was purified. This 6.5-kilobase pair DNA fragment was then ligated with a 1.0-kilobase pair DNA fragment containing a cat gene conferring chloramphenicol resistance (Cmr), which was purified from pCAT19 (23.Fuqua W.C. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 223-225PubMed Google Scholar) after it had been digested with the restriction enzymeSmaI. The resulting plasmid pDJ62 was linearized by digestion with the restriction enzyme EcoO109I (a unique site in vector), followed by transformation with the strain JC7623, which contains the recBC and sbcBC mutations (24.Winans S.C. Elledge S.J. Krueger J.H. Walker G.C. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 161: 1219-1221Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinants between the linear DNA and the chromosome were selected on LB + Cm plates. The true recombinants were Cm-resistant but Amp-sensitive. The rapA::cat null mutation (both the deletion and insertion mutation) was confirmed by the following criteria: 1) the absence of detectable RapA protein in the rapA null mutant as determined by two-dimensional electrophoresis and immunoblotting with antibodies raised against RapA and 2) the demonstration of linkages betweenrapA::cat and leu and between rapA::cat and carAby P1 transductions. Bacterial media and techniques were as described (25.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1972Google Scholar). Bacterial growth was followed by measuring the optical density of cultures at 600 nm with a spectrophotometer. TherapA::cat null mutation was transferred into different strain backgrounds by P1 phage-mediated transduction, and therapA null mutant was selected on LB + Cm plates. Themfd mutant (26.Selby C.P.

The mfdmutation was transferred into other strains by P1 phage-mediated transduction. The linkage between mfd and Tn10 is >50%, and the mfd phenotype was screened by UV sensitivity at a high UV irradiation dosage (28.Oller A.R. Fijalkowska I.J. Dunn R.L. Schaarer R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11036-11040Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Spontaneous or UV-induced rifampicin-resistant (Rifr) mutations were isolated as described (29.Jin D.J. Gross C.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 202: 45-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). For UV mutagenesis (25.Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Plainview, NY1972Google Scholar), about 5–10% of cells survived UV irradiation. Eight cultures of different strains were used for each set of experiments, and the cultures were plated on LB + rifampicin (50 μg/ml) plates. Cultures of different strains were grown in LB or M63 medium supplemented with glucose, amino acids, and vitamins. Either overnight or mid-log phase cultures were diluted 10-fold with plain M63 medium, and 1-ml aliquots of the diluted cultures were placed into 24-well cell culture plates (Costar, Corning Inc.). Cultures of different strains were tested simultaneously in different rows on each plate. To avoid differences that might be caused by their positions in the wells, cells from different cultures were randomly placed in different rows in different sets of experiments. The 24-well plate was placed either underneath a UV lamp(s) (254 nm) that was fixed on a stand or in the chamber of an UV Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene, CA) with five 254-nm 8-watt UV lamps. Cells were irradiated with different doses of UV light by placing aluminum foil on different wells for different lengths of time. The numbers of surviving cells for each UV dose were counted after plating an appropriate dilution of the cells on LB plates and incubating them overnight at 37 °C. Alternatively, a series of culture dilutions (10−3 to 10−6) were microdropped (10 μl) on LB plates. Cells from different strains on one plate were exposed to a given dosage of UV irradiation as described above. Different sets of plates were exposed to different dosages of UV irradiation. The numbers of surviving cells were counted after incubation overnight at 37 °C. To minimize light-induced reactivation of repair pathways, the experiments were performed with minimal background light. Previously, we showed that RapA forms a stable complex with RNAP holoenzyme, as if it were a subunit of RNAP (10.Sukhodolets M.V. Jin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7018-7023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Using the same conditions (in the presence of 0.1 m NaCl), we determined whether RapA also interacts with core RNAP. We found that a stable core RNAP-RapA complex can be reconstituted with highly purified RapA and core RNAP in vitro (Fig.1). When the 110-kDa RapA protein and core RNAP were mixed and passed through a Superose 6 HR gel filtration column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), they coeluted as a complex (Fig.1 A), whereas each of the two proteins eluted in different fractions when they were run separately (Fig. 1, C andD). These results showed that RapA also forms a stable complex with core RNAP, just as it forms a stable complex with RNAP holoenzyme (Fig. 1 B). Because we found that RapA co-purified only with RNAP holoenzyme and not with core RNAP during our purification procedure and that the fractions containing both RapA and RNAP holoenzyme were eluted at about 0.4 m NaCl in the final step of Mono-Q chromatography (10.Sukhodolets M.V. Jin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7018-7023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), we again studied the interaction of RapA with core or holoenzyme by gel filtration at 0.4 m NaCl (Fig.2). When RapA and the core RNAP were mixed and passed through the gel filtration column at 0.4 mNaCl, a significant fraction of RapA coeluted with RNAP as an RNAP-RapA complex (Fig. 2 A). The core RNAP-RapA complex was less stable at 0.4 m NaCl than at 0.1 m NaCl, as shown by the increasing dissociation of RapA from the complex, resulting in more free, unbound RapA at 0.4 m NaCl (compare Fig. 2 A with Fig. 1 A). However, the fraction of RapA bound to core RNAP at 0.4 m NaCl was still much greater that that bound to RNAP holoenzyme (Fig. 2 B). By scanning the Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250-stained gels, we estimated that the amount of RapA complexed with core RNAP was approximately 10 times greater than that complexed with RNAP holoenzyme. Apparently, the RNAP-RapA complexes behaved differently in gel filtration than in Mono-Q chromatography. To further demonstrate that RapA can interact with either core or holoenzyme, we also analyzed the interaction between RapA and the two forms of RNAP by glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation (Fig. 3). Consistent with the gel filtration results, we detected complex formation between RapA and either core or holoenzyme. Again, we found that the interaction between RapA and core RNAP was stronger than that between RapA and RNAP holoenzyme. At 0.7 μm RNAP and 0.7 μm RapA, while all RapA remained bound to core RNAP during the course of ultracentrifugation (Fig. 3 A), the less stable RNAP holoenzyme-RapA complex showed a trace of RapA dissociating from the complex (Fig. 3 B). The differences in RapA binding to core or holoenzyme were even more apparent at 0.06 μmRNAP and 0.12 μm RapA. At this lower concentration of proteins, while a fraction of RapA was still associated with core RNAP (Fig. 3 D), almost no RapA was associated with holoenzyme (Fig. 3 E). To determine whether binding to core RNAP can also stimulate the ATPase activity of RapA, we compared the ATPase activities of free RapA and core RNAP-RapA complexes (Fig. 4). The ATPase activity of core RNAP-RapA complex was nearly 4-fold higher than that of RapA alone (compare lane 2 withlane 5), very similar to that of RNAP holoenzyme-RapA complex (compare lane 2 withlane 6). The stimulation of RapA ATPase by binding to either core RNAP or RNAP holoenzyme further confirms that RapA interacts with both forms of RNAP. Moreover, it also provides a basis for determining the dissociation constants of RNAP-RapA complexes. We also determined the relative affinities of holoenzyme and core RNAP-RapA complexes by taking advantage of the stimulatory effect of RNAP on the RapA ATPase activity (Fig. 4). We used a fixed ratio (2:1) of Rap and RNAP in one set of experiments and RapA alone in a parallel set of experiments. We measured ATPase activity (A obs) in sequentially diluted reaction mixtures. We calculated the difference (ΔA obs) between the ATPase activities of RNAP-RapA mixtures and RapA alone at each RapA concentration and determined ΔA max(maximal activation) as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The ratio of ΔA obs and ΔA max was calculated and plotted as a function of RapA concentration (Fig. 5). We found that at high concentrations of proteins, the activation of RapA ATPase was relatively constant (plateau in Fig. 5). Upon sequential dilution, the activation of RapA ATPase decreased, as the RNAP-RapA complexes dissociated. Although this method cannot be used to obtain an explicitK d for the complex, we assumed that at half-maximal activation of RapA ATPase the free and bound RNAP concentrations were equal. Therefore, the K d can be approximated as the concentration of RapA at that point. The apparent K dvalues, calculated from this method, were 5–10 nm for RapA-core RNAP and 50–80 nm for RapA-RNAP holoenzyme complex. These values show that the RapA protein exhibits higher affinity to core RNAP than to RNAP holoenzyme, in agreement with the gel filtration and glycerol gradient ultracentrifugation studies described above. We probed the interface between RapA and RNAP using various cross-linking agents. Cross-linking experiments with EGS-NHS, a 12-carbon atom linker-bifunctional cross-linking reagent capable of modifying amino groups, yielded positive results, although we failed to obtain cross-linked RNAP-RapA complexes using several bifunctional reagents with the linker arm of fewer than 10 carbon atoms. To simplify the identification of new cross-linked species of the RNAP-RapA complex, we compared the patterns of the cross-linked protein products in the reactions containing RapA and RNAP with those in parallel reactions containing RNAP alone. It has been shown that RNAP subunits are capable of intramolecular cross-linking forming complex patterns (30.Hillel Z. Wu C.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3334-3342Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). After cross-linking, the reaction mixtures were separated on SDS-5% polyacrylamide gels, and the gels were either silver-stained or transferred onto Immnobilon P membranes for immunostaining with antibodies specific for RapA or various subunits of RNAP (Fig. 6). Fig. 6 A shows the kinetics of a representative cross-linking reaction. Core RNAP treated with EGS-NHS showed a complex pattern of high molecular weight bands as a result of intramolecular cross-linking of its subunits (Fig. 6 A, lanes 2–6). However, new cross-linked species appeared in the reaction containing core RNAP and RapA (Fig. 6 A, lanes 8–12). One new cross-linked product with an apparent molecular mass of 260–270 kDa that reacted with both β′-specific monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 6 B, lane 6, arrow) and RapA-specific polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 6 B, lane 2, arrow) is the RapA-β′ complex. Another new cross-linked product with an apparent molecular mass of about 150 kDa that reacted with both α-specific monoclonal antibodies and RapA-specific polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 6 C, lanes 8 and4, respectively) is therefore the RapA-α complex. Because this cross-linked product co-migrated with the β and β′ subunits, it was not apparent by silver staining (Fig. 6 A). In addition, a few new cross-linked complexes were found in the presence of RapA. One example is the product with a molecular mass of about 125 kDa that was apparent even by silver staining (Fig.6 A, marked as RapA CL1). It reacted with RapA-specific polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 6 B), suggesting that the cross-linked product might have an additional mass of about 15 kDa. Since our RNAP preparation contained the ω subunit of RNAP, which has a molecular mass of 10.1 kDa, we investigated whether this 125-kDa product was the RapA-ω complex. However, this cross-linked product did not react with ω-specific polyclonal antibodies (data not shown), confirming that it is not the RapA-ω complex. Since no other small proteins (or small RNAs) were noted in RNAP or RapA preparations (judging from silver-stained SDS-12% polyacrylamide gels), it seems likely that the unidentified cross-linked species are the result of intramolecular cross-linking of RapA itself (Fig. 6 A,RapA CL1 and RapA CL2). The same intramolecular cross-linking of RapA could explain the formation of another new RapA-containing cross-linked complex in Fig. 6 C(marked as RapA CL1 -α). Similarly, we treated either purified RNAP holoenzyme or the mixture containing RNAP holoenzyme and RapA with EGS-NHS in parallel cross-linking experiments (Fig. 7). The patterns of the cross-linked complexes of RNAP holoenzyme were significantly more complicated than that of core RNAP due to the presence of the ς-70 subunit, which is known to cross-link to multiple subunits of RNAP (30.Hillel Z. Wu C.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 3334-3342Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). We detected no apparent cross-linked species that reacted with both RapA-specific and ς-70-specific antibodies in the reactions containing RNAP holoenzyme and RapA (data not shown). However, it is interesting to note that in the presence of RapA the amount of the cross-linked α-ς-70 complex (which has a molecular mass of about 130 kDa) and the amount of the cross-linked α-α complex were significantly reduced (Fig. 7, lanes 2 and 4 and lanes 6 and8). This apparent RapA effect on the cross-linking efficiency indicates that RapA changes the configuration of holoenzyme upon its binding to RNAP. Previously, we analyzed the effects of RapA inin vitro transcription and detected only a marginal activation of the RNAP transcriptional activity (10.Sukhodolets M.V. Jin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7018-7023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). To study the function of the RapA protein in the cell, we constructed arapA null mutation by combining an internal deletion and an insertion of a cat (Cmr) cassette in the gene. The rapA gene appeared to be nonessential for the bacterial cell, based on the following criteria. 1) The rapA nullmutation could be introduced into other cells that harbored either a plasmid expressing the wild-type rapA gene or only the vector with similar efficiency by phage P1-mediated transduction. 2) The rapA null mutant exhibited no detectable difference in growth compared with wild-type cells under a variety of conditions, such as different incubation temperatures and growth media (data not shown). Similar results were also reported in Ref. 19.Muzzin O. Campbell E., A. Xia L. Severinova E. Darst S.A. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15157-15161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar. Because some eukaryotic SWI/SNF family members have been implicated in DNA repair, we explored the possibility that RapA could be important for DNA damage recovery. Originally, our preliminary results suggested that the rapA null mutant was hypersensitive to UV irradiation and the antibiotic mitomycin C (a DNA-damaging agent). 2Maxim V. Sukhodolets and Ding Jun Jin, unpublished observations. However, further studies determined that these phenotypes were caused by the presence of a cryptic phage with λ φ-80 immunity. Thus, the originally constructed rapA mutant was a lysogen for the phage; upon UV irradiation or mitomycin C treatment, the repressor of the cryptic phage was inactivated and the lysogenic phage was induced, and it entered the lytic phase of its cycle, resulting in increased cell death. After we constructed a phage-free rapA null mutant, we observed no UV-hypersensitive or mitomycin C-hypersensitive phenotypes compared with the wild-type isogenic strain (data not shown). Because it was reported recently by Muzzin et al. (19.Muzzin O. Campbell E., A. Xia L. Severinova E. Darst S.A. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15157-15161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) that disruption of the same E. coli gene (also calledhepA) caused UV sensitivity, we carefully analyzed this phenotype further (see “Experimental Procedures”). To assure that we could detect even marginal increases in UV sensitivity in our assays, we included the mfd mutant in every UV sensitivity assay as a control. The mfd gene encodes the transcription-repair coupling factor (26.Selby C.P. Witkin E.M. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11574-11578Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The mfd mutation has been reported to confer either no (27.Witkin E.M. Science. 1966; 152: 1345-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) or only mild increase in UV sensitivity (28.Oller A.R. Fijalkowska I.J. Dunn R.L. Schaarer R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11036-11040Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) when compared with the isogenic wild-type strains. Initially, we performed the UV sensitivity assays in the JC7623 strain background that contains the recBC and sbcBCmutations and was used for UV sensitivity assays by Muzzin et al. (19.Muzzin O. Campbell E., A. Xia L. Severinova E. Darst S.A. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15157-15161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The rapA null mutant behaved somewhat similar to the isogenic wild-type strain in response to UV irradiation, whereas the mfd mutant exhibited mild UV sensitivity compared with the wild-type strain (Fig. 8). We also performed the same experiments in the MG1655 strain background that is a prototype of the wild-type K12 strain and observed a pattern similar to that seen in JC7623 (Fig. 8). At low UV doses, there was a very small difference among the wild type and mfd andrapA mutants. At high UV doses, while the mfdmutant became noticeably UV-sensitive, the rapA mutant was only slightly more UV-sensitive than wild type strain. We also determined the UV sensitivity of the mfd rapA double mutant and found that the double mutant was only slightly more UV-sensitive than the mfd mutant (data not shown). The rapAnull mutation in each strain background was confirmed, and we detected no RapA in the mutants (Fig. 8 B). We also performed UV sensitivity assays using a microdrop method (see “Experimental Procedures”) and detected no significant differences in UV sensitivity between the rapA null mutation and the isogenic wild type strain, whereas the mfd mutation conferred an increase in UV sensitivity compared with the wild type strain (data not shown). To determine whether the rapA mutation affects mutation rate, we measured the occurrence of mutations conferring rifampicin resistance (Rifr) from either wild type cells or therapA null mutant (Fig. 9). We observed very similar spontaneous mutation rates of Rifrmutations from the two strains. With UV mutagenesis, the Rifr mutation rates were increased for the two strains. It appeared that the UV-induced Rifr mutation rate was about 2-fold lower in the rapA mutant when compared with the wild type strain. We have demonstrated that RapA interacts with both core RNAP and RNAP holoenzyme in a purified system using several different methods. By binding to either form of RNAP, the RapA ATPase activity is stimulated. Under the experimental conditions we used, RapA formed complexes with either core RNAP or RNAP holoenzyme in the nanomolar range, suggesting that the interaction is highly specific. However, the affinity of RapA to core RNAP is about 5–16-fold higher than to RNAP holoenzyme. If core RNAP is indeed the main RapA-binding form of RNAPin vivo, it indicates that the function of RapA is more likely related to transcription elongation/termination than to initiation. We are currently exploring this possibility. Previously, we found that almost all of the RapA protein molecules in the cell co-purified with RNAP holoenzyme (10.Sukhodolets M.V. Jin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7018-7023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We do not know why RapA was not associated with core RNAP during the Mono Q step of the RNAP purification procedure. Several possibilities could contribute to this apparent difference: 1) some special conditions during the RNAP purification procedure; 2) special chromatographic conditions; and 3) some factors missing in a purified system. On the other hand, Muzzinet al. (19.Muzzin O. Campbell E., A. Xia L. Severinova E. Darst S.A. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15157-15161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) reported that the same protein interacted only with core RNAP but not with holoenzyme. It is possible that differences in the nature of the protein and in the conditions for the binding assays contributed to these apparently different results. We have shown that RapA cross-links to the α and β′ subunits of RNAP, suggesting that it lies in the interface of these two subunits. Furthermore, it appeared that upon binding to RapA the RNAP holoenzyme alters its configuration, because the cross-linking efficiency of the α-ς-70 and α-α complexes was greatly reduced in the presence of RapA, although we detected no cross-linking between RapA and the ς-70 subunit or α-ς-70 complex. Because RapA is able to bind to RNAP holoenzyme, forming a 1:1 complex (10.Sukhodolets M.V. Jin D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7018-7023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), it is clear that the binding sites for RapA and the ς-70 are distinct. The E. coli RNAP structure has been determined from a combination of x-ray crystallography and electron microscopy (31.Darst S.A. Polyakov A. Richter C. Zhang G. J. Struct. Biol. 1998; 124: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The binding site for GreB on RNAP has been proposed (32.Polyakov A. Richter C. Malhotra A. Koulich D. Borukhov S. Darst S, A. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 281: 465-473Crossref Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The binding sites for RapA on RNAP await future determination. The rapA null mutant behaved very similar to the isogenic wild-type strain under various laboratory conditions. In the course of extended examination using two different genetic backgrounds, our experiments consistently showed that the rapA null mutant exhibited only a marginal increase in UV sensitivity compared with the wild-type strains (Fig. 8). The observed UV sensitivity of therapA mutant was significantly less than that of themfd mutant, which by itself showed only a mild increase in UV sensitivity compared with the wild type strain. Thus, our results were quantitatively different from the results reported by Muzzinet al. (19.Muzzin O. Campbell E., A. Xia L. Severinova E. Darst S.A. Severinov K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 15157-15161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This apparent difference could be due to the differences in strain backgrounds or experimental conditions used between the two laboratories. In that report, the authors also claimed that the expression level of the RapA (HepA) protein was substantially higher in the recBC sbcBC (JC7623) strain and speculated that the possible disruption of RecBCD function that is important for DNA repair pathways may be compensated by increased expression of RapA (HepA). However, we detected no substantial difference in the amount of RapA protein between the JC7623 strain and the wild-type MG1655 strain by immunoassays using antibodies against RapA (Fig. 8 B). Furthermore, the RapA expression level was not increased upon DNA damage induced by mitomycin C (data not shown). We also detected little or no effect of rapA on spontaneous or UV-induced mutational rates. Based on our data, it seems unlikely that RapA plays a major role in DNA repair, at least for damage induced by UV irradiation or mitomycin C. Currently, we are investigating the regulation ofrapA in the hope that it will lead to understanding of the function of this RNAP-associated protein.

These proteins initiate multiple signal transduction cascades that must occur cooperatively to produce a full biological response (8Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). Effector proteins bind to a small region of Ras termed the effector domain (9Katz M.E. McCormick F. Curr. Opin. Gen. Dev. 1997; 7: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar), whose core is comprised of residues 32–40. This region is also known as Switch I, as its conformation, along with that of an additional Switch II region (residues 61–77), changes substantially when Ras proteins bind GTP (10Wittinghofer A. Nassar N. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 488-491Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In addition to GDP/GTP cycling, another requirement for Ras activity involves the correct localization of Ras proteins to the inner surface of the plasma membrane. Plasma membrane binding of Ras is critical for its function because, at least in part, this allows Ras to target its effector proteins to the location where they encounter their substrates or can be activated (11Cox A.D. Der C.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta Rev. Cancer. 1997; 1333: F51-F71Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Newly synthesized Ras proteins are partitioned to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane by a series of post-translational lipid modifications of the C terminus of the protein (12Zhang F.L. Casey P.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 241-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1727) Google Scholar). The first lipid to be attached, a farnesyl group, appears to initiate membrane binding. Recent studies indicate that the endoplasmic reticulum is likely to be the site of first contact, followed by further trafficking to the plasma membrane that occurs through as yet unstudied pathways (13Choy E. Chiu V.K. Silletti J. Feoktistov M. Morimoto T. Michaelson D. Ivanov I.E. Philips M.R. Cell. 1999; 98: 69-80Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). For Ha-Ras, farnesylation of Cys186 is followed by the addition of palmitates to two adjacent cysteine residues (Cys181 and Cys184). Native Ha-Ras proteins with all C-terminal cysteines and lipids present are >95% membrane-bound at steady state, whereas Ha-Ras proteins that lack cysteines at 181 and 184 and thus have a farnesyl group as the only lipid are >90% cytosolic (14Cadwallader K.A. Paterson H. MacDonald S.G. Hancock J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4722-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 15Dudler T. Gelb M.H. J. Biol.

In addition to the lipids' roles in Ha-Ras targeting and stable association with the plasma membrane, the amino acids of the C terminus also appear to be involved in trafficking of Ha-Ras from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface (17Willumsen B.M. Cox A.D. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Buss J.E. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1901-1909PubMed Google Scholar). An important yet unresolved issue is whether the lipids or residues of the C-terminal region make a further contribution to Ha-Ras function by directly supporting interactions with specific effectors. Recent studies show that farnesyl modification of Ha-Ras is important for high affinity interaction with (18Hu C.-D. Kariya K. Tamada M. Akasaka K. Shirouzu M. Yokoyama S. Kataoka T. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Farnesylation is also reported to increase in vitro binding of Ha-Ras and KRas4B to p110γ, a PI3-kinase catalytic subunit family member (23Rubio I. Wittig U. Meyer C. Heinze R. Kadereit D. Waldmann H. Downward J. Wetzker R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 70-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Earlier studies employing a constitutively activated yeast Ras2 protein indicated that interaction between Ras2 and adenylyl cyclase is decreased in the absence of the farnesyl lipid modification (24Bhattacharya S. Chen L. Broach J.R. Powers S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2984-2988Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 25Kuroda Y. Noburu S. Kataoka T. Science. 1993; 259: 683-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A possible role in effector interaction for the lipids and C-terminal amino acids of Ras proteins is also implied by recent work reporting that Ha- and K-Ras proteins differ in their ability to activate Raf-1 and PI3-kinase (26Voice J. Klemke R. Le A. Jackson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17164-17170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 27Yan J. Roy S. Apolloni A. Lane A. Hancock J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24052-24056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). The major differences between the Ha-Ras and KRas4B proteins are confined to their post-translational lipid modifications and their last twenty-five amino acids. Although both proteins are farnesylated, Ha-Ras is modified by palmitates that are attached to cysteines 181 and 184, whereas KRas4B contains no palmitates and has instead a polybasic domain (lysine residues 175–180). Taken together, these data suggest that the C terminus of Ras proteins may provide a mechanism (in addition to that of the internal classical effector domain) for influencing effector interactions. In previous work we had characterized Ext61L, a constitutively activated Ha-Ras protein in which the C-terminal residue of the CAAX motif for farnesylation was replaced with six lysines (28Booden M.A. Baker T.L. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Punke S.G. Buss J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1423-1431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This design prevented attachment of the farnesyl group but retained the natural sites for palmitoylation at the C terminus. The novel lipidation state of Ext61L presented a new way to determine if the absence of a farnesyl group impaired any signaling pathways, in a protein that was acylated and maintained an interaction with membranes through its C terminus. A shift in Ha-Ras function had already been noted with Ext61L. Expression of the protein in PC12 cells caused an unusual morphological differentiation distinct from that induced by Ha-Ras61L with the native C terminus. Importantly, no changes had been made in the effector binding domain of Ext61L, and its GTP binding properties were preserved (28Booden M.A. Baker T.L. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Punke S.G. Buss J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1423-1431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), indicating that these primary requirements for effector interaction were unaltered. Here we describe results that suggest that the accentuated differentiation produced by Ext61L results from heightened activation of one Ras effector (PI-3 kinase) and suboptimal activation of another (B-Raf). These observations lend support to the idea that Ras-effector interactions may be influenced, in addition to the GTP-sensitive switch regions of the protein, by the C-terminal domain. Construction of Ha-Ras61L and Ext61L in the pcDNA3 vector has been described previously (28Booden M.A. Baker T.L. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Punke S.G. Buss J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1423-1431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Amounts of plasmid DNA (in brackets) were titrated so that equivalent amounts of Ha-Ras61L (1 μg of DNA), Ext61L (50 ng of DNA), Ha-Ras (1 μg), or ExtWT (1 μg) proteins were produced in the P100/membrane fraction of transfected cells. Plasmids driving expression of Myc- or hemagglutinin (HA)-epitope-tagged versions of the truncated protein Myc-PAK1-(165–205) (3 μg of DNA) (29Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M.

Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar) or full-length Myc-Cdc42(17N) (1 μg of DNA), Myc-Rac1(17N) (1 μg or 3 μg of DNA), or HA-Rac1 (7 μg of DNA) were kindly provided by Gary Bokoch (La Jolla, CA). Δp85 (1 μg of DNA) and Myc-RhoA(14V) (1 μg of DNA) in the pEXV3 vector have been described elsewhere (30Miller J. Germain R.N. J. Exp. Med. 1986; 164: 1478-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) and were gifts from Gideon Bollag (Richmond, CA) and Lawrence Quilliam (Indianapolis, IN). Wild type B-Raf and inositol 4-phosphatase (4-PTase) in the pcDNA3 vector were gifts from Geoff Clark (Bethesda, MD) and F. Anderson Norris (Ames, IA), respectively. The MEK inhibitor PD98059 and the PI3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 were purchased from Calbiochem and used at a concentration of 50 μm. Twenty-four hours before transfection, 1 × 105 PC12 cells were plated onto 60-mm tissue culture dishes coated with laminin (10 μg/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.) and grown overnight. These PC12 cells are derived from an early clone of the original isolate (generously provided by J. H. Pate Skene, Duke University), and if continuously subcultured before reaching high cell density, show high transfection efficiency and very low (<1%) spontaneous neurite extension. Transfections were performed using the LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described by the manufacturer. For most experiments the total amount of DNA added to each plate was adjusted to 5 μg using empty pcDNA3 vector DNA. For Rac-GTP binding assays a total of 8 μg of DNA (7 μg of Rac1 + 1 μg of a combination of empty vector and Ha-Ras DNA) was added per dish. Quantitation of the percentage of cells bearing neurites was performed on day 2 when neurites could still be accurately assigned to a particular cell body. Pictures of differentiated cells were taken, and biochemical assays were performed on day 4 when the morphological differences between cells expressing Ha-Ras61L and Ext61L were most distinct and when neurites in both types of Ras-transfected cells were well established. The efficiency of transfection was measured by co-transfection of cells with a β-galactosidase expression plasmid (26Voice J. Klemke R. Le A. Jackson J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 17164-17170Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) and by counting the percent of cells producing an immunofluorescence signal for Ha-Ras (below). Both methods showed that in cultures that were subjected to transfection, 60–70% of the cells expressed the transfected Ha-Ras protein and that 92–95% of these transfected cells expressed neurites. Expression of either cellular (wild type) forms or the activated Myc-RhoA(19N), Myc-Rac1(12V), or Myc-Cdc42(12V) proteins failed to promote PC12 neurite formation (data not shown) showing, as had been reported previously, that expression of these proteins individually is not sufficient to produce the complex response of neural differentiation (31Kozma R. Sarner S. Ahmed S. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1201-1211Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 32Daniels R.H. Hall P.S. Bokoch G.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 754-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Immunoblots using monoclonal antibodies to the HA epitope (Babco, MMS-101R) or to the Myc epitope tag (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, 9E10) confirmed that the dominant negative, cellular, and constitutively activated proteins were expressed (see Figs. 2 B and 3; other data not shown).Figure 3Identification of nucleotide bound to HA-Rac1 proteins. PC12 cells were transfected with HA-Rac1 and either Ha-Ras61L or Ext61L, and 4 days later they were incubated with32Pi for 4 h. The HA-Rac1 protein was immunoprecipitated, and bound nucleotides were eluted, separated by thin-layer chromatography, and detected by autoradiography. The amounts of GTP were quantified by phosphoimager analysis. The averages and S.D., from four independent experiments, of the portion of HA-Rac1 that bound GTP were 8 ± 2% in cells without Ras (lane 1), 10 ± 0.7% in cells co-expressing Ha-Ras61L (lane 2), and 17 ± 0.8% in cells expressing Ext61L (lane 3). An immunoblot (lower panel) of replicate plates verified that similar amounts of the HA-Rac1 were present in all immunoprecipitates.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) PC12 cells were plated on laminin-coated 18-mm coverslips in serum-containing medium. Within 24 h of plating, the cells were transfected as described above and cultured for 4 days. The cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed in fresh 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer for at least 30 min at room temperature. Cell membranes were permeabilized by incubation of cells in 0.2% Triton X-100, 5% goat serum, and 0.4% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 20 min at room temperature. To visualize the F-actin cytoskeleton, rhodamine isothiocyanate-phalloidin (Molecular Probes) in phosphate-buffered saline (1 ml of a 1/400 dilution) was added to each coverslip. After a 20-min incubation, coverslips were washed five times in phosphate-buffered saline, and the coverslips were mounted on a glass slide with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Detection of cells expressing Ha-Ras was performed by immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibody Y13–238 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at a 1/1000 dilution. Fluorescence was detected with a Nikon FXA microscope equipped with a 60× oil objective (1.0 numerical aperture), and images were captured with a Kodak Megaplus 1.4 CCD camera (Kodak Corp.) connected to a Perceptics MegaGrabber framegrabber (Perceptics Corp.) in a Macintosh 8100/80AV computer using NIH Image. Figures were prepared using Adobe Photoshop 4.0 and Macromedia Freehand Version 8.0 for the Macintosh. Cytosol and crude membrane fractions were separated by hypotonic lysis and high speed centrifugation as described (33Buss J.E. Solski P.A. Schaeffer J.P. MacDonald M.A. Der C.J. Science. 1989; 243: 1600-1603Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). For detection of interaction between Ha-Ras and PI3-kinase, the P100 membrane-containing pellets were dissolved in buffer A (20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). The S100 cytoplasmic fractions were adjusted to the composition of buffer A and Ha-Ras or PI3-kinase immunoprecipitates formed as described (34Zheng Y. Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18727-18730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with 150 μg of total protein from each fraction, as determined using the DC Protein Assay kit (Bio-Rad). To learn if detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) were preserved in the chilled 1% Triton X-100 buffer used for immunoprecipitation, any domains were solubilized, and proteins were released by warming the dissolved lysates for 2 min at 37°, followed by normal formation and washing of the immunoprecipitates (35Schroeder R.J. Ahmed S.N. Zhu Y. London E. Brown D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1150-1157Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In addition, the protein concentration in these samples was 150 or 300 μg/ml, far less than the 5 mg/ml needed to retain DRM integrity. To detect interaction between Ha-Ras and B-Raf, P100 membrane pellets were dissolved in buffer B (70 mm β-glycerophosphate (pH 7.2), 100 μm Na3VO4, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 20 μg/ml aprotinin). The S100 fractions were adjusted to the composition of buffer B (36Vaillancourt R.R. Gardner A.M. Johnson G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6522-6530Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), and 150 μg of total protein from each fraction were used to form either Ha-Ras or B-Raf immunoprecipitates. Ha-Ras, B-Raf, or PI3-kinase proteins were immunoprecipitated using anti-Ha-Ras rat monoclonal antibody (3E4-146, Quality Biotech), anti-p85α rabbit polyclonal serum (06–195, UBI), or anti-B-Raf rabbit polyclonal serum (C19, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Immunoprecipitates were captured on protein G-agarose beads (Life Technologies, Inc.), washed three times in their respective lysis buffer, and analyzed for co-immunoprecipitating proteins by immunoblotting with a p85α-specific mouse monoclonal antibody (UBI), Ha-Ras mouse monoclonal (3E4–146, Quality Biotech), or B-Raf goat polyclonal antibody (SC166, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (anti-mouse or goat, Pierce) were used with development by ECL (Pierce) using the manufacturer's protocol. PI3-kinase lipid kinase activity was measured using the in vitro assay described by Ref. 34Zheng Y. Bagrodia S. Cerione R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18727-18730Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar. Anti-p85 immune complexes were prepared from 300 μg of whole cell lysates or from 150 μg (each) of S100 and P100 fractions and incubated with [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi/reaction, ICN) and phosphatidylinositol (10 μg/reaction, Sigma) for 10 min. The phospholipids were extracted in CHCl3:CH3OH (1:1) and separated by thin layer chromatography on potassium oxalate-coated silica plates (Analtech) developed in propanol:2 m acetic acid (65:35). Radioactive32P-phosphatidylinositol-3 phosphate was detected by autoradiography, and the film images were scanned and quantified using the program ImageQuant (Molecular Dynamics). The radioactive phosphatidylinositol-3 phosphate product was identified on the basis of co-migration with an unlabeled phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate standard visualized by iodine staining. Duplicate p85 immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE, and p85 was detected by immunoblotting and quantified by scanning to determine the amounts of p85 captured in the immunoprecipitates. The activity of the endogenous B-Raf kinase was measured with a coupledin vitro kinase assay (37Li X. Lee J.W. Graves L.M. Earp H.S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2574-2583Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). B-Raf immune complexes from whole cell lysates (300 μg) were collected on protein A-conjugated agarose beads and incubated with nonradioactive ATP and purified recombinant MEK protein (100 μg/ml; provided by Dr. Lee Graves, Chapel Hill, NC). After 10 min, recombinant ERK2 (250 μg/ml; provided by Dr. Lee Graves) was added, and after another 10 min, 250 μg/ml myelin basic protein (Fisher) and [γ-32P]ATP (5 μCi/assay) were added. The reactions were finally terminated 10 min later by the addition of 100 mm EDTA; reaction products were spotted onto P-81 phosphocellulose paper (Whatman) and washed in 10% phosphoric acid, and incorporation of 32P into the precipitated myelin basic protein was quantitated by scintillation counting. At 4 days post-transfection, PC12 cells co-expressing HA-tagged Rac1 (7 μg DNA) and either Ha-Ras61L or Ext61L were incubated overnight in medium containing 1% dialyzed calf serum. Cells were then radiolabeled with 0.5–1 mCi/ml 32P inorganic phosphate (NEN Life Science Products) for 4 h in phosphate-free medium containing 1% dialyzed calf serum. Cells were lysed; samples were precleared of Ha-Ras by immunoprecipitation with antibody 3E4–146, and then the HA-Rac1 proteins were isolated by immunoprecipitation, as described above, using an anti-HA antibody (Babco, MMS-101R). GTP and GDP were separated by thin layer chromatography (28Booden M.A. Baker T.L. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Punke S.G. Buss J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1423-1431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) with the following important changes. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 250 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 20 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mmNa3VO4. For more quantitative elution of Rac-bound nucleotides it was necessary to heat the samples to 70 °C for 10 min in 20 μl of buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm EDTA, 2% (w/v) SDS, 2 mm GDP, and 2 mm GTP. PC12 cells respond to the expression of activated Ras proteins by the cessation of growth and the extension of neurites (38Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Adv. Cell. Neurobiol. 1982; 3: 373-414Crossref Google Scholar, 39Bar-Sagi D. Feramisco J.R. Cell. 1985; 42: 841-848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar, 40Guerrero I. Wong H. Pellicer R. Burstein D.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1986; 129: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). This differentiation process is characterized by rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton at the plasma membrane, leading to the formation of small lamellipodia, growth cones, and the subsequent extension of axon-like processes (41Gallo G. Letourneau P.C. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 80-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previously, the Ext61L protein had been shown to cause morphologic changes in PC12 cells that were easily distinguishable from those caused by Ha-Ras61L, including an increased number and accelerated rate of outgrowth of neuron- like structures and large lamellipodia with ruffles (28Booden M.A. Baker T.L. Solski P.A. Der C.J. Punke S.G. Buss J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1423-1431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This exaggerated response suggested that the Ext61L protein produced differentiation signals that were either exceptionally strong or that utilized different signaling pathways than Ha-Ras with a native C terminus and lipid modifications. To examine if the dramatic external morphological changes caused by Ext61L were accompanied by exaggerated changes in the actin filaments that are normally rearranged during neurite outgrowth, the distribution of filamentous actin was examined by immunofluorescence using rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin. Control cells treated with nerve growth factor formed actin-rich neurites after 4 days, with growth cones visible at the ends of the extending neurites (Fig.1 , NGF panel). Cell bodies displayed little flattening and low levels of filamentous actin. Similar changes in the actin cytoskeleton accompanied differentiation triggered by expressing Ha-Ras61L (Fig. 1 , 61L panel). Expression of Ext61L led to more extensive changes in actin structures. Neurites, often longer than 100 μm, developed within 24 h of transfection and at 4 days post-transfection cells exhibited marked somal flattening and very long, thin, actin-rich neurites displaying extensive branching (Fig. 1, Ext61L 50 μm panel). At higher magnification, cortical actin and actin-containing microspikes could be seen in the large membrane ruffles, with short perpendicular filament bundles leading to the edge of the cells and truncated and poorly organized actin filaments throughout the cell interior (Fig. 1 , Ext61L 25 μm panel). Thus the morphological changes caused by Ext61L involved actin cytoskeletal changes. More importantly, the exaggerated features of the changes caused by Ext61L indicated that Ext61L, although identical to Ha-Ras in its switch I (designated effector domain) and switch II regions, affected the actin cytoskeleton in a distinct way. Many aspects of actin cytoskeleton regulation, in both fibroblasts and PC12 cells, are controlled by the Rho family of GTPases, which include several Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 proteins (42Khosravi-Far R. Campbell S. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 72: 57-107Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 43Westwick J.K. Lambert Q.T. Clark G.J. Symons M. Van Aelst L. Pestell R.G. Der C.J. Mol. Cell.

Each of these proteins has also been reported to function downstream of Ha-Ras and to contribute to the effects of Ha-Ras on the actin cytoskeleton (45Joneson T. White M.A. Wigler M.H. Bar-Sagi D. Science. 1996; 271: 810-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 46Qiu R. Chen J. McCormick F. Symons M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Studies on response regulators have focused on the activity of each domain, but very little is known about the mechanism by which the regulatory domain inhibits the activator domain. In this study, we created a single amino acid substitution in the regulatory domain, D75S, which resulted in a dramatic decrease in sporulation <i>in vivo. In vitro</i> studies with the purified Spo0AD75S protein demonstrated that phosphorylation and DNA binding were comparable with wild type Spo0A. However, the mutant was unable to stimulate transcription by ς<sup>A</sup>-RNA polymerase from the Spo0A-dependent <i>spoIIG</i>operon promoter. We suggest that the amino acid Asp<sup>75</sup>and/or the region within which it resides, the α3-β4 loop, are involved in the inhibitory interaction between the regulatory and activator domains of Spo0A."
https://openalex.org/W2038261349,"This work is aimed at understanding how protein structure and conformation regulate activity and allosteric communication in the tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex from Salmonella typhimurium. Previous crystallographic and kinetic results suggest that both monovalent cations and a salt bridge between α subunit Asp56 and β subunit Lys167 play allosteric roles. Here we show that mutation of either of these salt bridging residues produced deleterious effects that could be repaired by increased temperature in combination with CsCl or with NaCl plus an α subunit ligand, α-glycerol 3-phosphate. Arrhenius plots of the activity data under these conditions were nonlinear. The same conditions yielded temperature-dependent changes in the equilibrium distribution of enzyme-substrate intermediates and in primary kinetic isotope effects. We correlate the results with a model in which the mutant enzymes are converted by increased temperature from a low activity, “open” conformation to a high activity, “closed” conformation under certain conditions. The allosteric ligand and different monovalent cations affected the equilibrium between the open and closed forms. The results suggest that α subunit Asp56 and β subunit Lys167 are not essential for catalysis and for allosteric communication between the α and β subunits but that their mutual interaction is important in stabilization of the active, closed form of the α2β2 complex.

Catalysis can be modulated by factors that change the enzyme conformation or alter the equilibrium distribution of preexisting conformations. These factors include ligands, solvents, chaotropic agents, temperature, and single site mutations. In the present work, we ask whether factors that stabilize the active conformation of an enzyme can also overcome the deleterious effects of mutations. We have recently investigated the effects of temperature on the activity of the tryptophan synthase α2β2complex (EC 4.1.2.20) in the reaction shown in Scheme FSI (1.Fan Y.X. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4692-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We found that the conditions that yield nonlinear Arrhenius plots of the activity data also yield temperature-dependent changes in the equilibrium distribution of the E-Ser and E-AA intermediates shown in Scheme FSI and in primary kinetic isotope effects. The results provide evidence for a temperature-induced conversion from a low activity open conformation to a high activity closed conformation (1.Fan Y.X. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4692-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Different monovalent cations, which bind to the β subunit, and an allosteric ligand (dl-α-glycerol 3-phosphate (GP)),1 which binds to the α subunit, affect the equilibrium distribution of the open and closed forms. Here we investigate the effects of increased temperature and of other factors that stabilize the active, closed conformation of tryptophan synthase on the effects of mutations in residues that can form a regulatory salt bridge between the α subunit and the β subunit. 2The term β2 subunit is used for the isolated enzyme in solution; β subunit is used for the enzyme in the α2β2 complex, for a specific residue in the β subunit or for the dissociation of the α and β subunits. Three-dimensional structures of wild-type and mutant forms of the tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex fromSalmonella typhimurium have revealed many features including the arrangement of the α and β subunits, the location of residues in the interface between the α and β subunits, and a monovalent cation binding site in the β subunit (2.Hyde C.C.

Although Na+, K+, and Cs+ bind to the same site in the β subunit, differences in coordination give rise to two distinctly different protein conformations (3.Rhee S. Parris K.D. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W.

In the presence of Na+, the carboxylate of βAsp305 forms a salt bridge with the ε-amino group of βLys167 (SchemeFSII A). In the presence of K+ or Cs+, the carboxylate of βAsp305 is in an alternative conformation and the ε-amino group of βLys167 moves about 7 Å and makes a salt bridge across the subunit interface with the carboxylate of αAsp56 (Scheme FSII B). Previous studies have shown that the activities of enzymes having mutations at βLys167 or αAsp56 are much higher in the presence of Cs+, K+, or NH4+ than in the presence of Na+(9.Yang X.-J.

These results suggest that certain ligands can repair the harmful effects of mutation by stabilizing the active conformation of the mutant enzymes. In the present work, we have compared the effects of temperature, monovalent cations (Na+ and Cs+), and an allosteric ligand (GP) on the wild type α2β2 complex and on two mutant α2β2 complexes, αD56A and βK167T. The results provide evidence that the mutagenesis of the residues involved in the salt bridge switch alters the catalytic and allosteric properties of the α2β2 complex. Increased temperature in the presence of CsCl or of NaCl plus GP reversed the deleterious effects of the mutations. The results indicate that the α subunit Asp56 and β subunit Lys167 are not essential for catalysis and for allosteric communication between the α and β subunits but that their mutual interaction is important in stabilization of the closed form of the α2β2 complex. l-Serine,dl-serine, GP, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate, and Bis-Tris propane were from Sigma. [α-2H]dl-Serine was prepared as reported previously (11.Miles E.W. McPhie P. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 2852-2857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Sodium-free GP was prepared by repeated passage of the solution of the disodium salt over an ion exchange column (DW-50 in the H+ form, Sigma) (12.Woehl E.U. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9466-9476Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar); the pH of the final eluate was adjusted to 7.8 with Bis-Tris propane. All experiments were carried out in 50 mm Bis-Tris propane buffer containing 0.5 mm dithiothreitol. The pH of this buffer was adjusted to 7.8 by the addition of HCl at 25 °C with no compensation for pH variation with temperature (1.Fan Y.X. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4692-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Wild type and mutant plasmids pEBA-10 and pEBA-4A8 (13.Yang L.-H. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) were used to express wild type and αD56A tryptophan synthase α2β2complex and the α subunit from S. typhimurium, respectively, in Escherichia coli CB 149 (14.Kawasaki H. Bauerle R. Zon G. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10678-10683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which lacks the trp operon. The wild type and mutant α2β2 were purified to homogeneity as described previously (15.Miles E.W. Kawasaki H. Ahmed S.A. Morita H. Morita H. Nagata S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6280-6287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The wild type α subunit was purified from extracts containing the α subunit alone (13.Yang L.-H. Ahmed S.A. Miles E.W. Protein Expression Purif. 1996; 8: 126-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 16.Yang X.-J. Ruvinov S.B. Miles E.M. Protein Expression Purif. 1992; 3: 347-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The αD56A α subunit was separated from the apo α2β2complex (17.Kanzaki H. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1991; 284: 174-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The βK167T α2β2 complex was obtained as described previously (9.Yang X.-J. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22269-22272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzymes were dialyzed against monovalent cation-free Bis-Tris propane buffer, pH 7.8, before use. Protein concentrations were determined from the specific absorbance at 278 nm using A1 cm1% = 6.0 for the α2β2 complex and A1 cm1% = 4.4 for the α subunit (18.Miles E.W. Bauerle R. Ahmed S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 398-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). One unit of activity is the formation of 0.1 μmol of product in 20 min at the indicated temperature. The activity in the β-replacement reaction with l-serine and indole was measured by a direct spectrophotometric assay (18.Miles E.W. Bauerle R. Ahmed S.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 142: 398-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) in the presence of excess α subunit (5 μm). [α-1H]dl-Serine and [α-2H]dl-serine were used in the place ofl-serine for investigations of primary kinetic isotope effects. The reaction mixtures were equilibrated for at least 5 min at the desired temperature before the addition of the enzymes. The concentration of l-serine (50 mm) used for assays was saturating because the same initial rates of the wild type or the mutant α2β2 complexes were obtained with 25, 50, and 100 mml-serine at 5 and 45 °C. Absorption spectra and assays were measured using a Hewlett-Packard 8452 diode array spectrophotometer thermostated by a Peltier junction temperature controlled cuvette holder, which was calibrated with a thermometer. Buffers containing indicated components were equilibrated at the desired temperature for at least 5 min; spectra were obtained immediately upon the addition of a twentieth volume of the enzyme. The activity data were plotted as logarithm of activity (ln Activity) versus the reciprocal of the absolute temperature in K (1/T) and fitted to the Arrhenius equation, Equation 1, ln Activity=lnZ−EaRTEquation 1 where Ea is the energy of activation,R is the gas constant, and Z is the preexponential factor. The results can be readily transformed into a rate constant,k cat. 4The turnover number,k cat, is equal to a factor f times the specific activity for the α2β2 complex (f = 0.00594). According to Eyring's transition state theory, the temperature dependence of a rate constant is given by Equation 2, kcat=kBThexp−ΔG‡RT=kBThexp−ΔH‡RTexpΔS‡REquation 2 where kB is the Boltzmann's constant,h is Planck's constant, and ΔG ≠, ΔH ≠, and ΔS ≠ are the free energy, enthalpy, and entropy of activation of the rate-limiting step in the reaction, respectively. From Equations 1 and2, the following can be shown (19.Cornish-Bowden A. Fundamentals of Enzyme Kinetics. Portland Press Ltd, London1995: 11-17Google Scholar). ΔS‡=RlnZ−lnkBh and ΔH‡=Ea−RT≈EaEquation 3 Thus, ΔH ≠ and ΔS ≠ can be determined from the Arrhenius plots. The equilibrium constant, K eq, for the E-Ser to E-AA conversion can be calculated from the temperature dependence of the absorbance using Equation 4, Keq(T)=[E−AA][E−Ser]=AT−AE­SerAE­AA−ATEquation 4 where AT is the absorbance of the solution at absolute temperature T,A E-AA andA E-Ser are the absorbance of E-AA obtained at higher temperature and of E-Ser obtained at low temperature, respectively. The temperature dependence of K eq is given by Equation 5, ΔG(T) eq=−RTlnKeq(T)=ΔHeq−TΔSeq=ΔHeq1−TTmEquation 5 where ΔH eq and ΔS eq are the changes in enthalpy and entropy of the reaction, respectively, and Tm is the midpoint, where K eq(T) = 1. Assuming no change in enthalpy or entropy with temperature, we can obtain ΔH eq and ΔS eqfrom the linear plot of lnK eq versus1/T; Tm = ΔH eq/ΔS eq. Fig. 1, A—C,shows the effects of temperature on the activities of the wild type α2β2 complex (1.Fan Y.X. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4692-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and of the αD56A and βK167T α2β2 complexes, respectively, in the presence of either NaCl or CsCl and in the absence or presence of the allosteric ligand, GP. Arrhenius plots of the data are shown in Fig. 1, D–F. At low temperatures (5–35 °C), the activities of the wild type α2β2 complex were much higher in the presence of CsCl than in the presence of NaCl (1.Fan Y.X. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4692-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, at temperatures above 35 °C, the activities were similar in the presence of NaCl or CsCl (Fig. 1 A). The Arrhenius plots (Fig. 1 D) of the data were nonlinear in the presence of NaCl but were linear in the presence of CsCl, GP plus NaCl, or GP plus CsCl. The activities of the αD56A and βK167T α2β2 complexes were very low in the presence of NaCl but were dramatically increased in the presence of CsCl. The specific activities of the mutant enzymes were somewhat higher than the activity of the wild type α2β2 complex at 37 °C (TableI) and at high temperatures (Fig. 1) in the presence of CsCl. The addition of GP stimulated the activities of the αD56A or βK167T enzymes in the presence of NaCl but inhibited the activities in the presence of CsCl. Although the activity of either mutant enzyme was lower in the presence of GP plus NaCl than in the presence of GP plus CsCl at low temperatures, the activities under the two conditions became similar at high temperatures (Fig. 1,B, C, E, and F).Table IEffects of monovalent cations on the apparent activation energies and the activation entropies of the reaction rates of the tryptophan synthase α2β2 complexEnzymeEffectorsArrhenius plotActivity at 37 °CE aΔS ‡Low THigh TΔLow THigh TΔ(kJ/mol)(J/mol K)WTNa+Nonlinear13101283494187−127314WTCs+Linear140034340−127−1270WTNa++GPLinear31050500−85−850WTCs++GPLinear20043430−101−1010αD56ANa+Linear7514114101941940αD56ACs+Nonlinear220014039101236−105341αD56ANa++GPNonlinear8601425686230−58288αD56ACs++GPLinear94056560−58−580K167TNa+Linear7012212201331330K167TCs+Nonlinear16501253887182−111293K167TNa++GPNonlinear6251265571173−64237K167TCs++GPLinear76055550−63−630Conditions for activity measurements and data analysis by Arrhenius plots are given in Fig. 2 and in the text.

The Arrhenius plots for the mutant enzymes were linear in the presence of NaCl or of GP plus CsCl but highly nonlinear in the presence of CsCl or GP plus NaCl (Fig. 1, E and F). The activation energies (Ea) and activation entropies (ΔS ≠) calculated from the Arrhenius plots are listed in Table I. The Ea value for either mutant enzyme in the presence of NaCl (141 or 122 kJ/mol) was similar to the Ea value for the wild type enzyme in the presence of NaCl at low temperature (128 kJ/mol). TheEa value for either mutant enzyme in the presence of CsCl at high temperature (∼39 kJ/mol) was similar to theEa for wild type enzyme in the presence of CsCl (34 kJ/mol). The Ea for the higher temperature portion of either mutant enzyme in the presence of NaCl and GP was similar to the Ea in the presence of CsCl and GP and was also similar to the Ea for the wild type enzyme in the presence of GP and NaCl or CsCl. The difference between the Ea and ΔS ≠ values at low temperature and at high temperature calculated from nonlinear Arrhenius plots were also similar for the wild type and mutant enzymes (Table I). The conditions that yielded nonlinear Arrhenius plots (Fig. 1 and Table I) also yielded temperature-dependent absorption spectra for the wild type α2β2complex (1.Fan Y.X. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4692-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and the αD56A and βK167T mutant enzymes (Fig.2). The spectra obtained from the reactions of the mutant enzymes with l-serine in the presence of CsCl (Fig. 2, A and B) or in the presence of NaCl plus GP (Fig. 2, C and D) were strongly temperature-dependent and were very similar to those reported for the wild type α2β2complex in the presence of NaCl or GuHCl (1.Fan Y.X. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4692-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Decreasing the temperature resulted in decreased absorbance at 340 nm (E-AA) and increased absorbance at 424 nm (E-Ser) (Scheme FSI). The presence of isosbestic points in the spectra (solid curves in Fig. 2,A–D) indicates that increasing the temperature shifted the equilibrium distribution of two intermediates from E-Ser to E-AA under these conditions. In contrast, the absorption spectra obtained from the reaction of either the αD56A or the βK167T α2β2 complex with l-serine in the presence of NaCl exhibited a peak at 424 nm (dashed curves in Fig. 2, A and B), which decreased slightly with increasing temperature between 5 and 50 °C (Fig. 2,E and F). Thus, in the presence of NaCl, E-Ser was the predominant intermediate and temperature did not markedly alter the equilibrium distribution of the E-Ser and E-AA intermediates. The reactions of the mutant enzymes with l-serine in the presence of GP plus CsCl yielded spectra that had a peak at 340 nm (dotted curve in Fig. 2, C and D) and were essentially temperature-independent at 4–50 °C (Fig. 2,E and F). The results indicate that the combination of CsCl and GP stabilized the E-AA intermediate of the mutant α2β2 complexes. Analysis of the absorbance data for the reactions of the mutant enzymes with l-serine in the presence of CsCl or of NaCl plus GP and of the wild type enzyme with l-serine in the presence of NaCl (1.Fan Y.X. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4692-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) yielded the thermodynamic parameters (ΔH eq and ΔS eq) andTm values for the conversion of E-Ser to E-AA (Table II). The ΔH eq and ΔS eq values were similar for the wild type and mutant enzymes (see “Discussion”). The Tm value for either mutant enzyme in the presence of CsCl (9 or 11 °C) was much lower than the Tm in the presence of NaCl and GP (18 or 21 °C). This result indicates that a higher temperature was needed to shift the equilibrium distribution of intermediates from E-Ser, which is favored by the open form, to E-AA, which is favored by the closed form, in the presence of GP and NaCl than in the presence of CsCl. Therefore CsCl, which binds at a site in the β subunit, was more effective in stabilizing the closed form than GP, which binds at the active site of the α subunit.Table IIEnthalpy and entropy changes for the equilibrium between E-Ser and E-AAEnzymeEffectorsΔH eqΔS eqT mkJ/molJ/molK°CWTNa+923278.4αD56ANa++GP9632818αD56ACs+983479K167TNa++GP8528921K167TCs+8730411Values of ΔH eq, ΔS eq, andT m were obtained by analysis of the spectroscopic data for the wild type α2β2 complex (1.Fan Y.X.

The conditions that yielded nonlinear Arrhenius plots (Fig. 1 and Table I) and temperature-dependent absorption spectra in the presence ofl-serine (Fig. 2 and Table II) also yielded temperature-dependent changes in the kinetic isotope effects for the reaction of l-serine and indole for the wild type α2β2 complex (1.Fan Y.X. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4692-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and the αD56A and βK167T α2β2 complex (Fig.3). The primary kinetic isotope effects were small (∼1.3) and essentially temperature-independent for the wild type α2β2 complex in the presence of CsCl (1.Fan Y.X. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4692-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and for the mutant enzymes in the presence of CsCl plus GP (Fig. 3). The kinetic isotope effect for either mutant enzyme in the presence of NaCl was large (∼5) and changed only slightly with temperature. In contrast, the kinetic isotope effects in the presence CsCl or NaCl plus GP were temperature-dependent and decreased with increasing temperature, as observed with the wild type enzyme in the presence NaCl or GuHCl (1.Fan Y.X. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4692-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Previous investigations of the tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex have shown that both the binding of a monovalent cation to a site in the β subunit and a salt bridge between βLys167 and αAsp56 in the contact region between the α and β subunits (Scheme FSII B) are important for the transmission of allosteric signals between the α and β subunits (8.Pan P. Woehl E. Dunn M.F. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 22-27Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 9.Yang X.-J. Miles E.W. J. Biol.

Birkhauser Verlag, New York2000Google Scholar).3 Our present results provide additional evidence that mutation of either βLys167 or αAsp56 affects allosteric communication and catalysis, most likely by altering the conformational states of the α and β subunits. Our most important finding is that increased temperature combined with an α subunit ligand (GP) or a certain cation (Cs+ or NH4+) 5The temperature dependence of the activity of the βK167T mutant α2β2 complex in the presence of NH4Cl was closely similar to that in the presence of CsCl (data not shown). reversed the deleterious effects of either mutation on activity. We propose that these activating conditions stabilize the active, closed conformation of the α2β2 complex. The occurrence of nonlinear Arrhenius plots under certain conditions (Fig. 2 and Table I) provides evidence for temperature-dependent conformational transitions in the wild type enzyme, as reported previously (1.Fan Y.X. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4692-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and in the αD56A and βK167T α2β2 complexes. A key finding is that there is an exact correlation between the effectors that yield nonlinear Arrhenius plots and the effectors that yield temperature-dependent changes in the equilibrium distribution of enzyme-substrate intermediates and in primary kinetic isotope effects for the wild type (1.Fan Y.X. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4692-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and mutant α2β2 complexes (Fig. 3 and TableIII). Another important observation is that the differences between the values of Ea and ΔS ≠ at low and high temperatures derived from nonlinear Arrhenius plots (Table I) were closely similar to the values of ΔH eq and ΔS eq for the conversion of E-Ser to E-AA obtained under analogous conditions (Table II) for both the wild type and mutant enzymes. These results support the proposal, made previously for the wild type enzyme (1.Fan Y.X. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4692-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), that the nonlinear Arrhenius plots result from conformational changes in the mutant enzymes. The absolute values of these thermodynamic constants were closely similar for both the wild type and the mutant enzymes, indicating that the same inferred conformational transition occurred with the wild type and mutant α2β2 complexes. Stabilization of the higher activity, closed conformation of the mutant enzymes at both high and low temperatures required the combination of two stabilizing effectors (Cs+ and GP), whereas stabilization of the wild type enzyme required only one stabilizing effector (either Cs+ or GP) (Table I). This result provides evidence that the mutations shifted the equilibrium toward the more open conformation.Table IIICorrelation between Arrhenius plots and temperature-dependent changes in absorption spectra and in primary kinetic isotope effectsEnzymeEffectorsArrhenius plotSpectral changesKIE changesWTNa+Nonlinear++WTCs+Linear−−WTNa++GPLinear−−WTCs++GPLinear−−αD56ANa+Linear−−αD56ACs+Nonlinear++αD56ANa++GPNonlinear++αD56ACs++GPLinear−−K167TNa+Linear−−K167TCs+Nonlinear++K167TNa++GPNonlinear++K167TCs++GPLinear−−Abbreviation used: KIE, kinetic isotope effects; WT, wild type.

The close parallel between the effects of mutation of either βLys167 or αAsp56 on the temperature dependence data argues that interaction between these two residues is important for stabilization of the active, closed conformation of the β subunit. An analogous argument has been made on the basis of the similar effects of these two mutations on the reaction and substrate specificities (10.Rowlett R. Yang L.-H. Ahmed S.A. McPhie P. Jhee K.-H. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2961-2968Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We have previously discussed the thermodynamic parameters for the cases that yield nonlinear Arrhenius plots in relation to the simple reaction mechanism shown in Equation 6 (1.Fan Y.X. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4692-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). E+Ser ⇌k21k12 E­Ser ⇌k32k23 E­AA →k31 E+TrpEquation 6 We showed (1.Fan Y.X. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4692-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) that at low temperatures, in the presence of Na+, the enzymatic rate constantk cat =K eq·k 31, whereK eq is the apparent steady-state equilibrium constant between E-Ser (open) and E-AA (closed) =k 23/(k 32 +k 31) in Equation 6, andk 31 is the rate constant of the rate-limiting step (E-Q2 → E-Trp). If these mutations have no effect on substrate binding or on interactions at the β site, the ∼90-fold decreases in the specific activities of the mutant proteins, detected under these conditions, can be ascribed to similar decreases inK eq. At 20 °C, disruption of the intersubunit salt bridge between βLys167 and αAsp56could destabilize the closed form of the protein by ∼10.9 kJ/mol (i.e., RTln∼90). However, it is possible that each mutation also affects the conformation of the subunit in which it resides. Mutations of other β subunit residues that do not form salt bridges with α subunit residues have indeed been found to alter the substrate and reaction specificity (21.Ahmed S.A. Ruvinov S.B.

Chem. 1995; 270: 17333-17338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Our finding that the activity of the wild type β2 subunit (1.Fan Y.X. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4692-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) was ∼6-fold higher than that of the βK167T β2 subunit (data not shown) in the presence of NaCl and ∼4-fold higher in the presence of CsCl at both high and low temperatures indicates that the conformation of the β2subunit is indeed altered by the βK167T mutation. The present and earlier (9.Yang X.-J. Miles E.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22269-22272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) findings that the deleterious effects of this mutation are repaired by association with the α subunit under some conditions show that the salt bridge is not essential for this intersubunit repair. Thus, activity measurements do not clearly distinguish between the effects of the βK167T mutation on the conformation of the β subunit and on the effects on the salt bridge with αD56A in the α2β2 complex. The small decreases in absorbance at 424 nm shown by the mutant complexes with l-serine at 40 °C in the presence of NaCl (Fig. 2, E and F) suggest that less than 5% of the enzymes are in the E-AA (closed) form. Under the same conditions, most of the wild type enzyme (>99%) is in this form (1.Fan Y.X. McPhie P. Miles E.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4692-4703Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Such marked changes in the distribution of enzyme intermediates indicate a large reduction in K eq (>2000-fold) for the mutant proteins, arising from destabilization of their closed form by at least 16.7 kJ/mol (i.e., RTln2000). We next ask what information our results give on the importance of the βLys167-αAsp56 salt bridge for allosteric communication? Important features of allosteric communication in the tryptophan synthase α2β2 complex include mutual activation of the α and β subunits upon association and ligand-induced alterations of the equilibrium distribution of enzyme-substrate intermediates and of activity. The βLys167-αAsp56 salt bridge is not essential for activation of the β subunit, as discussed above. Neither is the salt bridge essential for ligand-induced alterations in the distribution of intermediates, as shown by the effects of GP on the absorption spectra (Fig. 2). However, mutation of the salt bridge residues alters dramatically the effects of GP on the activity at the β site (Table I). The addition of GP increased the activity of the mutant enzymes in the presence of Na+. In contrast, GP reduced the specific activity of the wild type α2β2 complex to about 14% in the presence of Cs+, but only reduced the activities of the mutant α2β2 complexes under the same conditions to about 45% (Table I). We have suggested above that the activation of the mutant enzymes by GP in the presence of Na+ resulted from stabilization of the more active, closed conformation. The inhibition of the wild type enzyme by GP results from the stabilization of the closed form in which there is a decrease either in the rate constant of access of indole to the β site (24.Brzovic P.S. Ngo K. Dunn M.F. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3831-3839Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 25.Brzovic P.S. Sawa Y. Hyde C.C. Miles E.W. Dunn M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13028-13038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or in the rate-limiting step (E-Q2 → E-Trp in Scheme FSI). The smaller inhibition of the high activity form of the mutant enzymes by GP in the presence of Cs+ also suggests that the shift of the open to closed equilibrium is less complete in the mutant enzymes than in the wild type enzymes under these conditions. We conclude that αD56 and βK167 are not essential for catalysis and for allosteric communication between the α and β subunits but that mutual interaction is important in stabilization of the active, closed form of the α2β2 complex."
