https://openalex.org/W2057233735,"MAPLE syrup urine disease is an inherited disorder of amino-acid metabolism characterized clinically by irritability, rigidity, convulsive seizures and coma commonly manifest in the first weeks of life. Menkes1 found that patients afflicted with this neurological disorder excrete large amounts of branched-chain keto-acids in their urine, and Dancis et al.2 demonstrated a deficiency in branched-chain keto-acid decarboxylase in leucocytes. This enzyme defect results in the accumulation of branched-chain keto- and amino-acids in the plasma and tissues of these patients."

https://openalex.org/W2084010147,"THE postulate that a dual control of endocrine function by two kinds of neurosecretory fibre may be a fundamental feature of neuroendocrine systems1 has received much support in recent years2–4. It has been suggested that type A fibres, containing peptide hormones, and type B fibres, containing monoamines, may regulate intrinsic endocrine cells of the pituitary. Direct synaptoid contacts (that is, contacts which morphologically resemble synapses elsewhere in the central nervous system) have been demonstrated in an elasmobranch fish, but so far only in the pars intermedia2. In a teleost fish, the eel, type A and type B fibres invade all lobes of the pituitary4. In this fish the fibre terminals are separated from the intrinsic cells of the pars distalis by vascular channels, and so a morphological proof that pars distalis function in teleosts is under dual neurosecretory control was still incomplete. This problem has now been investigated in Hippocampus. This species was chosen because it has been shown by Da Lage5, using light microscopy, that neurosecretory fibres are closely associated with pars distalis cells."

https://openalex.org/W2065694779,"THE proportions of adrenaline and noradrenaline in the adrenal glands differ from one species to another and within a species during development. Comline and Silver1 have compiled a list of reports showing the percentage of noradrenaline in the adrenal gland catecholamines of foetal, newly born and adult animals of seven species. In general, a higher proportion of noradrenaline is associated with the foetal state and a higher proportion of adrenaline with the adult animal, which suggests that the ability of the adrenal glands to form adrenaline develops late in the foetal life or in the early life of the animal."

https://openalex.org/W2072770427,"IN 1962, it was reported that the petals of Paeonia albiflora Pall. contain considerable quantities of “pyrethroids”1. The chemical evidence was based on ultraviolet absorption maxima and on the supposed isolation of chrysanthemum mono- and di-carboxylic acids. Evidence that the compounds isolated from the peony were not identical with the pyrethroids that occur in Chrysanthemum cinerariaefolium is the reported melting point (205–206°) for the diacid. Naturally occurring (+)-chrysanthemum dicarboxylic acid has a melting point of 164° (ref. 2)."

The aim of the present investigation was to examine a simple alternative method of producing micropores, which might be expected to traverse thin sections of cellulose acetate. Freeze drying its solutions offers such an opportunity, because removal of the solvent will not cause the polymer to collapse. The porosity of the product decreases as the concentration of the solution increases, and the strongest possible solutions were therefore investigated."
