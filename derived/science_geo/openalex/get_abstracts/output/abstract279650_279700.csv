https://openalex.org/W2056047423,"Uranium-series dating of corals from marine deposits of the U.S. Atlantic Coastal Plain coupled with paleoclimatic reconstructions based on ostracode (marine) and pollen (continent) data document at least five relatively warm intervals during the last 500,000 years. On the basis of multiple paleoenvironmental criteria, we determined relative sea level positions during the warm intervals, relative to present mean sea level, were 7 +/- 5 meters at 188,000 years ago, 7.5 +/- 1.5 meters at 120,000 years ago, 6.5 +/- 3.5 meters at 94,000 years ago, and 7 +/- 3 meters at 72,000 years ago. The composite sea level chronology for the Atlantic Coastal Plain is inconsistent with independent estimates of eustatic sea level positions during interglacial intervals of the last 200,000 years. Hydroisostatic adjustment from glacial-interglacial sea level fluctuations, lithospheric flexure, and isostatic uplift from sediment unloading due to erosion provide possible mechanisms to account for the discrepancies. Alternatively, current eustatic sea level estimates for the middle and late Quaternary may require revision."

https://openalex.org/W2036277636,"Trace gases have been measured, by electron-capture gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry techniques, at the South Pole (SP) in Antarctica and in the U.S. Pacific Northwest (PNW) ( approximately 45 degrees N) during January of each year from 1975 to 1980. These measurements show that the concentrations of CCl(3)F, CCl(2)F(2), and CH(3)CCl(3) have increased exponentially at substantial rates. The concentration of CCl(3)F increased at 12 percent per year at the SP and at 8 percent per year in the PNW; CCl(2)F(2) increased at about 9 percent per year at both locations, and CH(3)CCl(3) increased at 17 percent per year at the SP and 11.6 percent per year at the PNW site. There is some evidence that CCl(4) ( approximately 3 percent per year) and N(2)O (0.1 to 0.5 percent per year) may also have increased. Concentrations of nine other trace gases of importance in atmospheric chemistry are also being measured at these two locations. Results of the measurements of CHClF(2)(F-22), C(2)Cl(3)F(3)(F-113), SF(6), C(2)-hydrocarbons, and CH(3)Cl are reported here."

The 4.5-kilogram device, consisting of a strap-supported electronics module and a hand-held probe containing three sensors, is powered by flashlight and transistor radio batteries, uses two silicon and one lead sulfide detector, has three liquid-crystal displays, features sample-and-hold radiometric sampling, and is spectrally configured to Landsat-D's thematic mapper bands TM3 (0.63 to 0.69 micrometer), TM4 (0.76 to 0.90 micrometer), and TM5 (1.55 to 1.75 micrometers). The device was designed to collect ground-truth data for the thematic mapper and to facilitate ground-based, remote-sensing studies of natural materials in situ. Prototype instruments were extensively tested under laboratory and field conditions, with satisfactory results."

https://openalex.org/W2039453395,Variations in the distribution of diatom species in surface sediments mirror distinct hydrographic regimes on the Bering shelf. Spring salinity fronts divide the water column into four zones with different vertical structures and different productivity patterns. Four assemblages of diatoms can be distinguished in sediments underlying the zones.
https://openalex.org/W2038056996,"Scale models of various early seed plant ovules and cupules were analyzed both for their characteristic air disturbance patterns and for the frequency of impact with airborne models of pollen (pseudopollen). The fossils on which the models were based had been arranged in an evolutionary sequence purporting to show the origin of the integument by the acropetal fusion and reduction in length of a subtending truss of lobes. Wind tunnel analyses of scale models showing the various stages in the consolidation of these preintegumentary lobes indicated that turbulent flow increases and becomes localized around the nucellar apex (salpinx) with the syngenesis and length reduction of those lobes. Similarly, the frequency of windborne pseudopollen impact increased. Thus, the transition from the megasporangium to the fully integumented ovule appears to favor increased wind-mediated pollination."

Ryanodine-ATP injections caused a 9-fold increase in oxygen consumption in the roach, and in one case, where the ATP had been warmed to 450 C and then cooled to room temperature before mixing with the ryanodine, the oxygen consumption was increased to 18 times normal following injection. In the intact roach the ryanodine-ATP effect was reversible in the concentrations used. In the intact frog and the rectus preparations the rigor produced was irreversible. These results strengthen our belief that ryanodine acts specifically on the contractile process in striated muscle and indicate that the mode of action is probably one of interference with the phosphagen-ATP-ADP-actomyosin cycle during contraction."

The recent decoding of a series of tokens makes it possible to identify the signs as units of grain metrology, land measure, animal numeration, and other economic units."

https://openalex.org/W1972455958,"A recently installed satellite system now provides modern long-distance telecommunication services to 100 rural Alaskan villages, most of whose residents are Alaska Natives. In most villages no local telephone or television distribution facilities have yet been installed. Local telephone exchange service appears to be economically marginal unless modest regulatory changes are made. Television delivery presents more difficult problems involving technical and organizational structure. If, after weighing the potential social and cultural effects, village residents elect to acquire television, a delivery system based on low-power transmitters in the villages, local government as the basic organizational and economic unit, and a statewide nonprofit service organization, is the feasible system best suited to village needs."
