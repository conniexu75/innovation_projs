https://openalex.org/W2018742856,"Subalpine forests of the northern Appalachians are subject to significant deposition of water and chemicals via cloud droplet impaction. This deposition has been estimated by a method linking micrometeorological measures of turbulent transfer, a detailed representation of canopy structure, and experimentally derived capture efficiencies. Water inputs from clouds are about 46 percent, and chemical inputs range from 150 to 430 percent of the bulk precipitation."
https://openalex.org/W2052069581,"A new antibiotic ""bacitracin"" has been recovered from a strain of the B. subtilis group of organisms. It is neutral, water-soluble, non-toxic and relatively heat stable. In vitro it is active chiefly against Grampositive organisms, but the gonococcus and meningococcus are susceptible to its action. It is also active in vivo against experimentally produced hemolytic streptococcal infections in mice and gas gangrene infections in guinea pigs. Clinical use in hemolytic streptococcal and staphylococcal infections in man have given encouraging results."
https://openalex.org/W2040340049,Analyses of lignin oxidation products and pollen for an 11-meter core from Lake Washington provide independent but similar reconstructions of the late Quaternary vegetation in the Puget Lowland. An exception is in sediments of the late Pleistocene where pollen percentages and influx values suggest conifer forest whereas lignin compositions suggest a treeless source region. This dissimilarity appears to result from different major provenances: eolian transport of pollen to the lake from adjacent or downstream drainage basins as opposed to fluvial transport of lignified plant debris only from the Lake Washington drainage basin.

https://openalex.org/W2021135143,"A network of 121 monitoring stations has been established in the US to collect airborne and settled dust samples for radioactive assay. The results from 30,000 samples collected in conjunction with the 8 detonations in Nevada between April 1 and June 4, 1953 are given. For brief periods following an explosion the radioactive background can be increased in distant areas by fallout of airborne dust."

https://openalex.org/W2057819650,"El Chich√≥n volcano erupted at 2322 hours on 28 March 1982 after being dormant during historic times. Three major eruptions of tephra occurred between that date and 7 April, discharging approximately 0.3 cubic kilometer of andesitic pyroclastic material. The initial eruption produced crystal-rich tephra of higher silica and alkali content than the lithic pyroclastic materials of the second and third eruptions. The initial tephra consists of primarily juvenile materials, whereas the later eruptions produced both lithic and juvenile fractions."

https://openalex.org/W2025445333,"Abstract The mechanism of the coagulation of latex is a very brief chapter in most treatises on rubber. The theories are numerous and conflicting. The most widely accepted interpretation is one in which the destruction of the stabilization membrane is postulated. Recently, in Haiti, I made an electrophoretic study of latex involving the determination of mobility rates and isoelectric points. The timing of the migration of individual latex particles obviously necessitated the use of a microscope. This permitted constant observation of the globules, so that not only were their rate and direction of movement observed, but their aggregation as well. When latex is put into a buffer mixture of a pH value at or near the isoelectric point of the latex, agglutination of the particles takes place. While observing this incipient coagulation of the latex, I was led to the conclusion that, though pH values of isoelectric points indicate a protein covering on latex particles, electrophoretic behavior points to a surfac..."
