https://openalex.org/W1978968660,"The epidermis is a stratified squamous epithelium forming the barrier that excludes harmful microbes and retains body fluids. To perform these functions, proliferative basal cells in the innermost layer periodically detach from an underlying basement membrane of extracellular matrix, move outward and eventually die. Once suprabasal, cells stop dividing and enter a differentiation programme to form the barrier. The mechanism of stratification is poorly understood. Although studies in vitro have led to the view that stratification occurs through the delamination and subsequent movement of epidermal cells, most culture conditions favour keratinocytes that lack the polarity and cuboidal morphology of basal keratinocytes in tissue. These features could be important in considering an alternative mechanism, that stratification occurs through asymmetric cell divisions in which the mitotic spindle orients perpendicularly to the basement membrane. Here we show that basal epidermal cells use their polarity to divide asymmetrically, generating a committed suprabasal cell and a proliferative basal cell. We further demonstrate that integrins and cadherins are essential for the apical localization of atypical protein kinase C, the Par3-LGN-Inscuteable complex and NuMA-dynactin to align the spindle."

We analysed human colorectal cancers for genetic mutations in 340 serine/threonine kinases and found mutations in eight genes, including in three members of the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K) pathway. The discovery of this mutational activation of a key cell-signalling pathway may provide new targets for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2007648282,"The c-Myc oncoprotein promotes proliferation and apoptosis, such that mutations that disable apoptotic programmes often cooperate with MYC during tumorigenesis. Here we report that two common mutant MYC alleles derived from human Burkitt's lymphoma uncouple proliferation from apoptosis and, as a result, are more effective than wild-type MYC at promoting B cell lymphomagenesis in mice. Mutant MYC proteins retain their ability to stimulate proliferation and activate p53, but are defective at promoting apoptosis due to a failure to induce the BH3-only protein Bim (a member of the B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl2) family) and effectively inhibit Bcl2. Disruption of apoptosis through enforced expression of Bcl2, or loss of either Bim or p53 function, enables wild-type MYC to produce lymphomas as efficiently as mutant MYC. These data show how parallel apoptotic pathways act together to suppress MYC-induced transformation, and how mutant MYC proteins, by selectively disabling a p53-independent pathway, enable tumour cells to evade p53 action during lymphomagenesis."

https://openalex.org/W2074803927,"The mechanism of action of chemotherapeutic drugs and their ability to induce multidrug resistance (MDR) are of relevance to cancer treatment. Overexpression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) encoded by the MDR1 gene following chemotherapy can severely limit the efficacy of anticancer agents; however, the manner by which cells acquire high levels of Pgp has not been defined. Herein, we demonstrate that chemotherapeutic drugs induce specific epigenetic modifications at the MDR1 locus, concomitant with MDR1 upregulation mediated by transcriptional activation, and a potential post-transcriptional component. We have established that the mechanisms are not mutually exclusive and are dependent on the methylation state of the MDR1 promoter. MDR1 upregulation did not result in further changes to the CpG methylation profile. However, dramatic changes in the temporal and spatial patterning of histone modifications occurred within the 5' hypomethylated region of MDR1, directly correlating with MDR1 upregulation. Specifically, drug-induced upregulation of MDR1 was associated with increases in H3 acetylation and induction of methylated H3K4 within discrete regions of the MDR1 locus. Our results demonstrate that chemotherapeutic drugs can actively induce epigenetic changes within the MDR1 promoter, and enhance the MDR phenotype."

Rotenone, an environmental PD toxin, exhibited much greater toxicity to DA neurons in midbrain neuronal cultures than to non-DA neurons. The effect was significantly decreased by the microtubule-stabilizing drug taxol and mimicked by microtubule-depolymerizing agents such as colchicine or nocodazole. Microtubule depolymerization disrupted vesicular transport along microtubules and caused the accumulation of dopamine vesicles in the soma. This led to increased oxidative stress due to oxidation of cytosolic dopamine leaked from vesicles. Inhibition of dopamine metabolism significantly reduced rotenone toxicity. Thus, our results suggest that microtubule depolymerization induced by PD toxins such as rotenone plays a key role in the selective death of dopaminergic neurons.

At the cellular level Parkinson disease is characterized by the selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra. A variety of genetic and environmental factors contribute to such a specific loss. Long term epidemiological studies have indicated that exposure to agricultural pesticides represents a significant risk factor for Parkinson disease (1Langston J.W. Neurotoxicology. 2002; 23: 443-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). It has been found recently that long term, systemic administration of rotenone, a natural substance widely used as a pesticide, produces selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and PD 2The abbreviations used are: PD, Parkinson disease; DA, dopamine; vGlut2, vesicular glutamate transporter 2; TH, tyrosine hydroxylase; VMAT2, vesicular monoamine transporter 2; TUNEL, TdT-mediated dUTP-X nick end labeling; MAO, monoamine oxidase; MES, 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid; GABA, γ-aminobutyric acid; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; ROS, reactive oxygen species.-like locomotor symptoms in rats (2Betarbet R.

Rotenone is a membrane-permeable compound that has two known molecular targets in the cell; it inhibits complex I in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (3Chance B. Williams G.R. Hollunger G. J. Biol. Chem. 1963; 238: 418-431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and depolymerizes microtubules (4Brinkley B.R. Barham S.S. Barranco S.C. Fuller G.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1974; 85: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 5Marshall L.E. Himes R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 543: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The former activity has been studied extensively but could not fully explain the specificity of rotenone toxicity on DA neurons, as rotenone infusion uniformly inhibits complex I in all brain areas (2Betarbet R. Sherer T.B. MacKenzie G. Garcia-Osuna M. Panov A.V. Greenamyre J.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1301-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (2984) Google Scholar). Although the latter activity causes microtubule depolymerization in every type of cells, the consequence would be quite different. Nigral dopaminergic neurons send very long axons to striatum to control voluntary locomotor activity. Axonal transport of vesicles are mediated by microtubule-based motor proteins (6Goldstein L.S. Neuron. 2003; 40: 415-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Microtubule depolymerization would disrupt vesicular transport and cause the accumulation of vesicles in the soma. In the case of DA neurons, the cargo is dopamine, whose oxidation produces large quantities of reactive oxygen species and may trigger cell death (7Hastings T.G. Lewis D.A. Zigmond M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1956-1961Crossref PubMed Scopus (475) Google Scholar). Other types of cells that do not have extensive processes or do not contain an oxidizable neurotransmitter (e.g. glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons) would be spared even though their microtubules are depolymerized by rotenone to a similar extent. In the present study we attempt to elucidate the role of microtubule depolymerization in the selective toxicity of rotenone on DA neurons. Antibodies and Reagents—Rabbit anti-TH was from Affinity BioReagents (Golden, CO). Mouse anti-TH was from Pel-Freez (Rogers, AK). Mouse anti-NeuN or anti-GAD, guinea pig anti-vGlut2, and rabbit anti-GAT1 were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). Mouse antibodies against FLAG, syntaxin I, or synaptophysin as well as fluorescein isothiocyanate- or rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibodies against mouse, rabbit, or sheep were from Sigma. Cy5-conjugated anti-mouse antibody was from Amersham Biosciences. Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated anti-guinea pig IgG was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Apoptosis was detected by TdT-mediated dUTP-X nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining using a kit from Roche Applied Science. Midbrain Neuronal Culture, Image Acquisition, and Quantification—Primary midbrain neuronal cultures were prepared from rat embryos at E18 as previously described (8Ren Y. Zhao J.H. Feng J. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 3316-3324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cultures on coverslips were maintained in 12-well plates in neurobasal media supplemented with 2% B27 (Invitrogen) and AraC (5 μm, Sigma) for 14 days before they were treated with various drugs. Treated neuronal cultures were fixed and stained as previously described (9Zhao J. Ren Y. Jiang Q. Feng J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4011-4019Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In experiments with TUNEL staining, the reaction was performed for 1 h at 37°C before incubation with antibodies. Green, red, or blue signals in all images represented fluorescence from fluorescein isothiocyanate, rhodamine, or Cy5 channels, respectively. In some experiments, treated midbrain cultures were stained in culture media containing 4 μg/ml propidium iodide (PI; from Sigma) for 5 min at 37 °C in the dark. After the cultures were washed three times in PBS, they were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with relevant antibodies as described previously (9Zhao J. Ren Y. Jiang Q. Feng J. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 4011-4019Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Fluorescence images on cell death were acquired on a Nikon fluorescence microscope with a CCD camera (Diagnostic Instrument, Sterling Heights, MI), and merged using the software SPOT (Diagnostic Instrument). For each condition, at least three coverslips from independent experiments were examined. All TH+ neurons on a coverslip (100–200) were counted together with a random selection of 120–250 TH- neurons. Images on microtubule morphology and vesicle accumulation were acquired on a confocal microscope from Bio-Rad. Quantification of synaptophysin or syntaxin I intensity was performed using NIH Image J. The contour of the soma was drawn manually. The degree of synaptophysin or syntaxin I accumulation in the cell body was calculated by dividing the intensity of background-subtracted signal within the border by its area. At least 10 TH+ and 10 TH- neurons were analyzed for each coverslip, and at least 3 coverslips were used for each treatment. There was no significant difference between TH+ and TH- neurons with regard to accumulation of these puncta in response to rotenone or colchicine. All data were expressed as the mean ± S.E. Statistical analyses were performed with unpaired t test using the software Origin (Origin Lab, Northampton, MA). Measurement of Protein Carbonyls—Midbrain neuronal cultures were treated with various agents for 4 h under culture conditions, washed 3 times in PBS, and lysed in cold lysis buffer (0.5% v/v Nonidet P-40, 1 m Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 10% v/v glycerol, 0.5 m EDTA, and 0.1 m Na3VO4). In some experiments midbrain slices (400 μm thick) from 3–4-week-old male SD rats were cut on a vibratome as described before (10Feng J. Yan Z. Ferreira A. Tomizawa K. Liauw J.A. Zhuo M. Allen P.B. Ouimet C.C. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 9287-9292Crossref PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Slices were treated with various agents for 2 h at room temperature under constant oxygenation (95% O2, 5% CO2) in a buffer containing 126 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 26 mm NaHCO3, 1.25 mm NaH2PO4, 1 mm pyruvic acid, and 10 mm glucose, pH 7.4 (300–305 mosmol/liter). Treated slices were homogenized in cold lysis buffer described above. Protein carbonyls were measured with the Oxyblot protein oxidation detection kit (Chemicon) as described before (11Jiang H. Ren Y. Zhao J. Feng J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2004; 13: 1745-1754Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μg of proteins from total cell lysates were incubated with an equal volume of 12% SDS and 2 volumes of 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine solution for 15 min at room temperature and then with 1.5 volumes of neutralization solution to stop the reaction. The samples were spotted on a nitrocellulose membrane, dried, and cross-linked with a UV Crosslinker (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Membranes were Western-blotted with an antibody against 2,4-dinitrophenyl to detect protein carbonyls that are derivatized by 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine. Intensities of the dots were quantified with NIH Image J by measuring signals in a preset circle of the same size. Measurement of Free or Polymerized Tubulin in the Cell—Free or polymerized tubulin from midbrain neuronal cultures was extracted using a standard protocol (12Joshi H.C. Cleveland D.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 663-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Briefly, midbrain neuronal cultures maintained in 3.5-cm dishes in vitro for 14 days were washed twice at 37 °C with 1 ml of Buffer A containing 0.1 m MES, pH 6.75, 1 mm MgSO4, 2 mm EGTA, 0.1 mm EDTA, and 4 m glycerol. After the cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 5 min in 600 μl of free tubulin extraction buffer (Buffer A plus 0.1% v/v Triton X-100 and protease inhibitors), the extracts were centrifuged at 37 °C for 2 min at 16,000 × g. The supernatant fractions contained free tubulin extracted from the cytosol. The pellet fraction and lysed cells in the culture dish were dissolved in 600 μl of 25 mm Tris, pH 6.8, plus 0.5% SDS and contained tubulin originally in a polymerized state (i.e. as microtubules). Equal amounts of total proteins from free or polymerized tubulin fractions were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-α-tubulin antibody (Sigma). The intensity of tubulin bands was quantified from three different experiments with the software NIH imaging. Tubulin Polymerization Assay—The assay was performed using a standard protocol described before (13Himes R.H. Burton P.R. Kersey R.N. Pierson G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 4397-4399Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Briefly, purified tubulin (>99% purity, from Cytoskeleton, Denver, CO) was mixed on ice with varying concentrations of rotenone in PEM buffer (0.1 m PIPES, 1 mm MgSO4, and 1 mm EGTA) with 20% glycerol and 1 mm GTP. The final concentration of tubulin was kept at 5.0 mg/ml. After 15 min of incubation on ice, the mixture was placed at 37 °C, and light absorbance at 340 nm was monitored continuously on a Shimadzu UV160U spectrometer with temperature control. Turbidity of the solution reflects the degree of tubulin polymerization. The experiment was repeated three times with similar results. Tubulin-[3H]Dihydrorotenone Binding Assay—Binding of [3H]dihydrorotenone to tubulin was determined by the DEAE-cellulose filter assay according to the procedure of the [3H]colchicine-tubulin binding assay described previously (14Borisy G.G. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 50: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 15Tse C. Doherty R.A. J. Neurochem. 1980; 35: 767-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). The assay was conducted in 50 μlof binding buffer (0.1 m PIPES, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.1 mm GTP, pH 6.8) containing 20 μg purified tubulin (Cytoskeleton) and an appropriate amount of [3H]dihydrorotenone (60 Ci/mmol, American Radio-labeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO). After incubation at room temperature for 1 h, the mixture was applied onto a pre-wetted stack of 4 DE81 DEAE-cellulose filter discs (2.3 cm in diameter). The filter stack was washed 10 min later with 40 ml of cold binding buffer containing 0.1 m KCl and then placed in 10 ml of scintillation fluid to measure the radioactivity bound to tubulin on DE81 discs. Nonspecific binding was determined with the same amount of bovine serum albumin in place of tubulin. In some experiments, a 200-fold excess of unlabeled rotenone or colchicine was preincubated with tubulin for 30 min at room temperature before the addition of [3H]dihydrorotenone. All experiments were repeated three times with similar results. Rotenone Has a Much Higher Toxicity on TH+ Neurons Than on TH- Neurons—Long term systemic administration of rotenone causes selective degeneration of nigral DA neurons in rats (2Betarbet R. Sherer T.B. MacKenzie G. Garcia-Osuna M. Panov A.V. Greenamyre J.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1301-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (2984) Google Scholar). To study the mechanism underlying the specific toxicity of rotenone, we treated rat embryonic midbrain neurons cultured for 14 days with various concentrations of rotenone for 12 h. Most of the neurons expressing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in such cultures are dopaminergic neurons. We co-stained fixed cultures with antibodies against TH and the neuronal nuclear marker NeuN to highlight TH+ and TH- neurons. TUNEL staining was used to label cells undergoing apoptosis. Rotenone induced apoptosis and broken processes in TH+ neurons, whereas most of the TH- neurons in the same culture were unaffected (Fig. 1B). As shown in Fig. 1C, rotenone caused significant apoptosis of TH+ neurons at all concentrations tested (p < 0.01, versus control, n = 3∼10 coverslips for each condition) but produced much less apoptosis in TH- neurons. The differential effects of rotenone were also observed when neuronal death was quantified by staining with PI, a membrane-impermeable fluorescent dye that labels nuclear DNA in dead cells (Fig. 1D). With this readout, higher percentages of TH- neurons were killed by rotenone compared with results from TUNEL staining. This suggests that, at rotenone concentrations above 1 μm both apoptosis and necrosis are induced in the cell. To substantiate these results, we examined the time-course of rotenone-induced cell death in TH+ and TH- neurons. When midbrain neuronal cultures were treated with 10 nm rotenone, almost all TH+ neurons were killed by 24 h. In contrast, the percentages of apoptotic TH- neuron were much lower at all time points examined (Fig. 1E). Similar results were obtained when cell death was quantified by PI-staining (data not shown). We also examined the time-course of cell death in response to 10 μm rotenone. Both PI staining (Fig. 1F) and TUNEL staining (data not shown) produced similar results, that TH+ neurons were much more sensitive than TH- neurons to rotenone toxicity at 12 through 72 h. To confirm the specificity of rotenone toxicity, we examined the death of major neuronal populations in the same cultures by using antibodies against GABA transporter-1 (GAT-1) or vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vGlut2) to label GABAergic or glutamatergic neurons, respectively. Rotenone produced very mild toxicity on GABAergic or glutamatergic neurons, which was similar to that on TH- neurons but was much lower than that on TH+ neurons (Fig. 1G). Furthermore, we examined rotenone toxicity on cortical neuronal cultures, which contained mostly glutamatergic or GABAergic neurons but very few TH+ neurons. As shown in Fig. 1H, the toxicity of rotenone on TH- neurons in cortical cultures was very mild and almost the same as TH- neurons in midbrain cultures, which was much lower than that on TH+ neurons. Together, our results above demonstrated the much higher toxicity of rotenone on TH+ neurons compared with TH- neurons including GABAergic or glutamatergic neurons. The Selective Toxicity of Rotenone on TH+ Neurons Is Dependent on Its Microtubule-depolymerizing Activity—Rotenone treatment (10 μm for 12 h) depolymerized microtubules in all neurons, producing shrunk and broken processes (Fig. 2B). Co-application of taxol (10 μm), a well established microtubule-stabilizing drug, significantly blocked rotenone-induced apoptosis and restored normal morphology of the processes and microtubules inside (Fig. 2C). As summarized in Fig. 2D, the selective toxicity of rotenone at 10 nm or 10 μm was significantly reduced by 100 nm or 10 μm taxol, respectively (p <0.01, n = 4∼8 coverslips for each condition). No significant toxicity was found for taxol compared with the control (p > 0.05, n = 4). On the other hand, the effect of taxol and rotenone co-treatment (both at 10 μm) on TH- neurons (9.0 ± 1.4%) was not significantly different from the mild toxicity of 10 μm rotenone alone (14.2 ± 3.1%, p > 0.20, n = 6∼8). Low concentrations of rotenone (10 nm) had no significant toxicity on TH- neurons (Fig. 1C). To confirm that microtubule depolymerization did cause specific death of TH+ neurons, we treated midbrain cultures with colchicine, a well characterized microtubule-depolymerizing agent. Colchicine (10 μm for 12 h) induced significant apoptosis in TH+ but not TH- neurons (Fig. 2F). Co-application of taxol (10 μm) greatly reduced colchicine toxicity (Fig. 2G). Colchicine-induced microtubule depolymerization led to shrunk and broken processes (Fig. 2F), very similar to the situation with rotenone treatment (Fig. 2B). Co-treatment with taxol prevented microtubule depolymerization and restored normal morphology of the processes and microtubules (Fig. 2G). As summarized in Fig. 2H, colchicine-induced apoptosis of TH+ neurons was almost completely blocked by taxol (p < 0.001, n = 4∼9). On the other hand, the effect of colchicine (10 μm) on TH- neurons (6.70 ± 1.12%) was not significantly different from the control (4.26 ± 1.11%, p > 0.15, n = 4∼9) and was not significantly changed by taxol co-treatment (5.08 ± 1.67%, p > 0.40, n = 4∼9). We found that colchicine selectively killed TH+, but not TH-, neurons in a dose-dependent manner from 1 nm to 50 μm (data not shown). To further substantiate our findings, we treated midbrain neuronal cultures with a different microtubule-depolymerizing agent, nocodazole, at 10 μm for 12 h. As summarized in Fig. 2H, nocodazole induced apoptosis of TH+ neurons (39.0 ± 3.7%, n = 3) to a similar extent as that by colchicine (44.5 ± 4.1%, n = 9, p > 0.05). The toxicity of nocodazole was greatly reduced by co-application of 10 μm taxol (10.2 ± 0.8%, n = 3, p < 0.01). In contrast, the toxicity of nocodazole on TH- neurons (4.78 ± 0.88%, n = 3) was much less than that on TH+ neurons and was not significantly different from the Me2SO vehicle control (4.26 ± 1.11%, n = 9, p > 0.10). Together, these lines of evidence suggest that microtubule depolymerization has much higher toxicity in TH+ neurons than in TH- neurons. Rotenone Toxicity Is Contributed Both by Its Microtubule-depolymerizing Activity and by Its Ability to Inhibit Complex I—The toxicity of colchicine or nocodazole on TH+ neurons was more specific, but weaker, than that of rotenone. If this difference is due to the complex I-inhibiting activity of rotenone, then the combination of a pure complex I inhibitor and a pure microtubule-depolymerizer might mimic the effect of rotenone. To test this hypothesis, we chose amytal, a complex I inhibitor with no known effect on microtubules. Amytal treatment (10 μm for 12 h) induced a moderate level of apoptosis in TH+ neurons without significantly affecting microtubules (Fig. 3B). Co-application of amytal and colchicine (10 μm for 12 h) markedly increased apoptosis in TH+, but not in TH-, neurons (Fig. 3C). Microtubule depolymerization was evident, and neuronal processes were fragmented (Fig. 3C). The toxicity of amytal was not significantly reduced by co-treatment with taxol (10 μm) (Fig. 3D). As summarized in Fig. 3E, the combination of amytal and colchicine (64.5 ± 4.0%, n = 4) was significantly more toxic than either agent alone (44.5 ± 4.1%, n = 9, for colchicine; 32.2 ± 5.6%, n = 8, for amytal; p < 0.01, double versus single treatments) and was equivalent to rotenone at 1 μm (67.0 ± 11.6%, n = 3, p > 0.05) but much less than the toxicity of 10 μm rotenone (86.8 ± 3.4%, n = 8). The additive effect in the dual treatment suggests that colchicine and amytal act on different sites that independently contribute to cell death. This was corroborated by the result that taxol did not significantly alleviate amytal toxicity on TH+ neurons (p > 0.15, amytal plus taxol (19.7 ± 6.2%, n = 8) versus amytal alone (32.2 ± 5.6%, n = 8)). Rotenone Depolymerizes Microtubules in Neuronal Cultures, Blocks in Vitro Polymerization of Tubulin, and Binds to Purified Tubulin Directly—To directly compare the impact of rotenone, colchicine, and amytal (all at 10 μm) on microtubules, we measured the amount of free or polymerized tubulin in midbrain neuronal cultures treated without or with these agents for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were gently lysed at 37 °C in a low concentration of detergent (0.1% v/v Triton X-100) to extract free tubulin while not disturbing polymerized tubulin in microtubules. As shown in Fig. 4A, the amount of free tubulin was greatly increased in response to rotenone (4.90 ± 0.42-fold of the control, n = 3 experiments, p < 0.001) or colchicine (5.00 ± 0.42-fold, n = 3, p < 0.001). In contrast, amytal did not significantly change the amount of free tubulin (1.02 ± 0.13-fold, n = 3, p > 0.80), confirming its lack of effect on microtubules. Incubation with taxol (10 μm for 10 min) before the addition of rotenone or colchicine completely blocked the effects of rotenone or colchicine. Reciprocal changes were observed in the amounts of polymerized tubulin (Fig. 4A). We also examined the effect of low concentrations of rotenone on microtubules using this assay, since rotenone concentrations in the brain of the rat PD model are estimated to be 20–30 nm (2Betarbet R. Sherer T.B. MacKenzie G. Garcia-Osuna M. Panov A.V. Greenamyre J.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1301-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (2984) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4B, rotenone significantly increased the amount of free tubulin at 10 nm (1.61 ± 0.19-fold of the control, n = 3, p < 0.01) and 100 nm (3.97 ± 0.39-fold, n = 3, p < 0.01). The microtubule-depolymerizing effects of rotenone at these low doses appear to be similar to or stronger than those of colchicine at the corresponding concentrations (10 nm colchicine, 1.23 ± 0.06-fold; 100 nm colchicine, 2.08 ± 0.23-fold; n = 3). At 10 μm, both rotenone and colchicine had similar potency in inducing microtubule depolymerization. Reciprocal changes were observed in the amounts of polymerized tubulin in microtubules (Fig. 4B). Next, we performed in vitro biochemical experiments to show that the effect of rotenone on microtubules is direct rather than through its complex I-inhibiting activity, which produces reactive oxygen species in cells. Using purified bovine tubulin (>99% purity) from a commercial source (Cytoskeleton, Inc.), we examined the effect of rotenone on the in vitro polymerization of tubulin into microtubules, which was monitored by the turbidity of the solution (A340 nm). As shown in Fig. 4C, rotenone inhibited the self-assembly of tubulin in a dose-dependent manner. The result is very similar to a previous study (5Marshall L.E. Himes R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 543: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To demonstrate that rotenone binds directly to tubulin, we utilized the standard DEAE-cellulose filter binding assay originally developed to measure the binding of tubulin and [3H]colchicine (14Borisy G.G. Anal. Biochem. 1972; 50: 373-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 15Tse C. Doherty R.A. J. Neurochem. 1980; 35: 767-774Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Purified bovine tubulin (>99% purity, 20 μg) was incubated at room temperature for 1 h with 30 nm [3H]dihydrorotenone, a frequently used radio-labeled derivative of rotenone (2Betarbet R. Sherer T.B. MacKenzie G. Garcia-Osuna M. Panov A.V. Greenamyre J.T. Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 1301-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (2984) Google Scholar). The mixture was absorbed by pre-wetted DEAE-cellulose filter discs, which were subsequently washed extensively to remove unbound radioactivity. The same amount of bovine serum albumin was used to measure nonspecific binding, which was subtracted from total binding to derive specific binding. As shown in Fig. 4D, [3H]dihydrorotenone was strongly bound to purified tubulin in vitro. This binding was almost completely blocked by preincubation of tubulin with unlabeled rotenone or colchicine (a 200-fold molar excess of [3H]dihydrorotenone) or heat inactivation of tubulin (100 °C for 5 min). These results suggest that rotenone binds directly to tubulin on the colchicine site, as previous studies have indicated (4Brinkley B.R. Barham S.S. Barranco S.C. Fuller G.M. Exp. Cell Res. 1974; 85: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 5Marshall L.E. Himes R.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 543: 590-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). To assess the affinity of the binding between rotenone and tubulin, we performed the same assay with increasing concentrations of [3H]dihydrorotenone. As shown in Fig. 4E, [3H]dihydrorotenone bound to tubulin in a dose-dependent and saturable manner. Scatchard analysis of the data from three separate experiments showed that the Kd of this interaction was 22.4 ± 2.8 nm (Fig. 4F). Rotenone-induced Microtubule Depolymerization Leads to Accumulation of Vesicles in the Soma—Microtubule depolymerization disrupts vesicular transport, which in the case of dopaminergic neurons would result in accumulation of dopamine vesicles in the soma. Leakage of dopamine from these vesicles (16Floor E. Leventhal P.S. Wang Y. Meng L. Chen W. J. Neurochem. 1995; 64: 689-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 17Eisenhofer G. Kopin I.J. Goldstein D.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2004; 1018: 224-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) would lead to increased DA oxidation and oxidative stress (18Liu Y. Edwards R.H. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 125-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). To test this model, we treated midbrain neuronal cultures with or without rotenone (20 nm for 12 h) and co-stained them with antibodies against synaptophysin and TH. In control cells shown in the merged image in Fig. 5A, synaptophysin puncta were observed in the soma as well as in the processes in both TH+ and TH- neurons. The amount of synaptophysin puncta in the soma was minimal (inset 1 of Fig. 5A). After rotenone treatment, significantly more synaptophysin puncta were seen in the cell body in both types of neurons (Fig. 5B). Co-application of taxol (10 μm) blocked the rotenone-induced increase of synaptophysin puncta (Fig. 5C). Application of colchicine (10 μm for 12 h) also increased synaptophysin puncta in the cell body (Fig. 5E). This effect was greatly attenuated by taxol co-treatment (Fig. 5F), whereas taxol alone (Fig. 5D) did not cause any obvious change compared with the control. We quantified the effects on synaptophysin localization by the ratio of its fluorescence signal in the soma to the area of the cell body. Because there was no significant difference between TH+ and TH- neurons regarding this parameter, we measured the effect in all cells. As shown in Fig. 5G, rotenone induced a marked increase in this ratio in comparison to the control (p < 0.001, n = 3 coverslips for each condition). The effect was significantly attenuated by taxol (p < 0.001, n = 3). Colchicine had an effect similar to that of rotenone, which was also blocked by taxol (p < 0.001 versus colchicine alone, n = 3). Because almost all secretory vesicles are transported along microtubules (6Goldstein L.S. Neuron. 2003; 40: 415-425Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and would, thus, be affected by microtubule depolymerization, we examined the subcellular localization of syntaxin I, a t-SNARE (soluble NSF N-ethylmaleimide factor attachment) protein destined for the plasma membrane including that on the presynaptic terminal (19Chen Y.A. Scheller R.H. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2001; 2: 98-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). As summarized in Fig. 5H, rotenone or colchicine induced a significant increase of syntaxin I puncta in the soma (p < 0.001 versus control, n = 3). The effects were significantly blocked by the co-application of taxol (p < 0.001 versus the corresponding treatment without taxol, n = 3). The accumulation of vesicles in response to rotenone or colchicine correlated with apoptosis of TH+"

The mystery is why, as both take their colour from the same anthocyanin pigment. A new X-ray crystal structure determination of the cornflower pigment suggests that the blue arises from a previously unknown supramolecular complex that combines six anthocyanin and six flavone molecules with iron, magnesium and calcium ions. The same anthocyanin pigment makes roses red but cornflowers blue1, a phenomenon that has so far not been entirely explained. Here we describe the X-ray crystal structure of the cornflower pigment, which reveals that its blue colour arises from a complex of six molecules each of anthocyanin and flavone, with one ferric iron, one magnesium and two calcium ions. We believe that this tetrametal complex may represent a previously undiscovered type of supermolecular pigment."

Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) that are coupled to inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate formation and the release of intracellular Ca2+ stores play an important role in regulating neuronal function. We show here that mGluRs interact with the Htt-binding protein optineurin that is also linked to normal pressure open angled glaucoma and, when expressed in HEK 293 cells, optineurin functions to antagonize agonist-stimulated mGluR1a signaling. We find that Htt is co-precipitated with mGluR1a and that mutant Htt functions to facilitate optineurin-mediated attenuation of mGluR1a signaling. In striatal cell lines derived from HttQ111/Q111 mutant knock-in mice mGluR5-stimulated inositol phosphate formation is also severely impaired when compared with striatal cells derived from HttQ7/Q7 knock-in mice. In addition, we show that a missense single nucleotide polymorphism optineurin H486R variant previously identified to be associated with glaucoma is selectively impaired in mutant Htt binding. Although optineurin H486R retains the capacity to bind to mGluR1a, optineurin H486R-dependent attenuation of mGluR1a signaling is not enhanced by the expression of mutant Htt. Because G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) protein expression is relatively low in striatal tissue, we propose that optineurin may substitute for GRK2 in the striatum to mediate mGluR desensitization. Taken together, these studies identify a novel mechanism for mGluR desensitization and an additional biochemical link between altered glutamate receptor signaling and Huntington disease.

The HD gene mutation consists of an unstable CAG repeat resulting in a polyglutamine expansion in the amino-terminal region of the huntingtin (Htt) protein, a ubiquitously expressed and evolutionary conserved protein (1Cell. 1993; 72: 971-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6893) Google Scholar). It is the polyglutamine expansion of the Htt amino terminus that is proposed to cause progressive widespread neuronal death in the neocortex and the striatum of HD patients. Although the precise function of Htt in cells is not completely understood, analysis of the proteins with which Htt interacts suggests that Htt plays a role in regulating clathrin-coated vesicle-mediated endocytosis, neuronal survival, vesicle transport, morphogenesis, calcium homeostasis, and transcriptional regulation (4Harjes P. Wanker E.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 425-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Glutamate-mediated neurotoxicity has been postulated to play an important role in the pathogenesis and excitotoxic neuronal cell loss in HD (5DiFiglia M.

Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2691) Google Scholar). The ionotropic receptors comprise cation-specific ion channels that mediate fast excitatory glutamate responses and are subdivided into AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptors. There is a considerable body of evidence to support the idea that glutamate released from cortical afferents may regulate the excitotoxic damage observed in HD by activating both NMDA and AMPA/kainate receptors (5DiFiglia M. Trends Neurosci. 1990; 13: 286-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar, 6Beal M.F. Ferrante R.J. Swartz K.J. Kowall N.W. J.

Neurogenetics. 2005; 6: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In particular, there is increased sensitivity to NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxic cell death in a YAC128 transgenic mouse model of HD (11Zeron M.M. Hansson O. Chen N. Wellington C.L. Leavitt B.R. Brundin P. Hayden M.R. Raymond L.A. Neuron. 2002; 33: 849-860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) and NR2A and NR2B receptor gene variations modify the age of HD onset (12Arning L. Kraus P.H. Valentin S. Saft C. Andrich J. Epplen J.T. Neurogenetics. 2005; 6: 25-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). More recently, Group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) linked to the activation of phospholipase C, increase in intracellular inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) formation, and the release of intracellular Ca2+ stores have been proposed to contribute to the underlying pathophysiology of HD. Specifically, the survival of R6/2 HD transgenic mice is significantly increased following treatment with mGluR5 antagonists (13Schiefer J. Sprunken A. Puls C. Luesse H.G. Milkereit A. Milkereit E. Johann V. Kosinski C.M. Brain Res. 2004; 1019: 246-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In addition, mutant Htt and Htt-associated protein 1 interactions with the IP3 receptor result in altered mGluR5-stimulated Ca2+ signaling (14Tang T.S. Tu H. Chan E.Y. Maximov A. Wang Z. Wellington C.L. Hayden M.R. Bezprozvanny I. Neuron. 2003; 39: 227-239Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). This increased Ca2+ release is associated with increased apoptosis of medium spiny striatal neurons derived from a YAC128 transgenic mouse model of HD (15Tang T.S. Slow E. Lupu V. Stavrovskaya I.G. Sugimori M. Llinas R. Kristal B.S. Hayden M.R. Bezprozvanny I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 2602-2607Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Thus, glutamate signaling via both ionotropic and metabotropic receptors may be linked with Htt function and HD. Optineurin (OPTN) is one of a number of recently identified Htt-interacting proteins (4Harjes P. Wanker E.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 425-433Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). OPTN is a coiled-coiled protein that was first identified as a positive regulator of tumor necrosis factor-α-mediated apoptosis (16Li Y. Kang J. Horwitz M.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 1601-1610Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). OPTN interacts with a variety of proteins that link it to the regulation of cellular morphogenesis and membrane trafficking (Rab8), vesicular trafficking (Htt), and transcription activation (TFIIIA) (17Faber P.W. Barnes G.T. Srinidhi J. Chen J. Gusella J.F. MacDonald M.E. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1463-1474Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar, 18Hattula K. Peranen J. Curr.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1986-1993Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Mutations in OPTN are responsible for ∼17% of hereditary forms of normal tension glaucoma (20Rezaie T. Child A. Hitchings R. Brice G. Miller L. Coca-Prados M. Heon E. Krupin T. Ritch R. Kreutzer D. Crick R.P. Sarfaraz M. Science. 2002; 295: 1077-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). The link between OPTN, apoptosis, and the retinal degeneration observed in glaucoma has lead to the suggestion that OPTN mutants may directly induce optic neuropathy leading to visual loss (20Rezaie T. Child A. Hitchings R. Brice G. Miller L. Coca-Prados M. Heon E. Krupin T. Ritch R. Kreutzer D. Crick R.P. Sarfaraz M. Science. 2002; 295: 1077-1079Crossref PubMed Scopus (883) Google Scholar). This has lead to the suggestion that OPTN represents a common factor involved in protection against neuronal cell death. Here we show that OPTN is also a Group I mGluR-interacting protein that functions to inhibit mGluR G protein coupling to phospholipase C and IP3 signaling. Moreover, we show that polyglutamine-expanded mutant Htt but not wild-type Htt potentiates the inhibition of mGluR signaling. The association of OPTN with both Htt and mGluRs may provide an additional biochemical link that may help shed light upon the relationship between glutamate-induced neurotoxicity and HD.

Bovine serum albumin was obtained from Bioshop Canada Inc. (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) Mouse anti-HA (12CA5) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Roche Applied Science. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG secondary antibodies were from Amersham Biosciences. Quisqualate was purchased from Tocris Cookson Inc. (Ellisville, MO). [3H]myo-Inositol was acquired from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The Dowex 1-X8 (formate form) resin with 200-400 mesh was purchased from Bio-Rad. LysoTracker Red was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody, mouse anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody, and all other biochemical reagents were purchased from Sigma. Yeast Two-hybrid Screening—A human brain cDNA library in the pGAD10 vector, used in the two-hybrid screen, was purchased from Clontech. pGAD10 contains the ADH promoter expressing the GAL4 transactivation domain (amino acids 768 to 881). The yeast reporter strain Y190 harbors two reporter gene constructs. Two-hybrid interactions activate the transcription of the HIS3 gene, allowing screening for growth in the absence of histidine, and of the lacZ gene, allowing screening for β-galactosidase activity. Expression of the mGluR1-Ct-GAL4-binding domain fusion protein from pAS2-mGluR1-Ct in yeast strain Y190 was verified by immunoblotting with anti-mGluR1a antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., Lake Placid, NY). Y190 was cotransformed with pAS2-mGluR1-Ct and the pGAD10-human brain cDNA library and plated at a density of 5 × 104 colonies/plate on synthetic minimal medium lacking leucine and tryptophan (for plasmid selection) and histidine but containing 25 mm 3-aminotriazole. The plates were incubated at 30 °C for 5-7 days. Approximately 2.5 × 106 yeast transformants were screened. Colonies that grew were transferred to fresh selective plates and assayed for β-galactosidase activity by a filter assay. Yeast two-hybrid backcrosses were performed using the yeast reporter strain Y190 (MATa, leu2-3, 112 ura 3-5, trp1-901, his3-D200, ade 2-101) cotransformed with pGAD-OPTN (amino acid residues 202-246), and pAS2 mGluR1a-Ct using a modified lithium acetate method according to the manufacturer's instructions. Double transformants were plated on synthetic yeast drop-out medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, uracyl, and histidine in the presence and absence of 25 mm 3-aminotriazol and incubated 3-5 days at 30 °C. Liquid β-galactosidase assays were conducted according to standard procedures. Plasmid Construction—The FLAG-mGluR1a and amino-terminal myc-tagged and wild-type GRK2 constructs were described previously (21Dhami G.K. Dale L.B. Anborgh P.H. O'Connor-Halligan K.E. Sterne-Marr R.

The pGEX4T-Htt constructs were then digested with BamHI and NotI. The Htt-containing fragments were cloned into pcDNA3myc. Full-length human OPTN was cloned by PCR amplification using a Quick Clone kit (Clontech). Amino-terminal myc- or HA-tagged wild-type OPTN and HA-tagged OPTN-H486R were constructed by PCR amplification and mutagenesis of human OPTN cDNA and inserted into the BamHI/EcoRI sites of pcDNA3. The sequence integrity of each of the constructs was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. The bait for the yeast two-hybrid screen was constructed as follows. The rat mGluR1a carboxyl-terminal tail (amino acids 841-1199) was PCR-amplified and cloned into pAS2-1 (Clontech) using BamHI and EcoRI restriction sites to generate pAS2-mGluR1-Ct. For expression of amino-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins in mammalian cells, the cDNA encoding the mGluR1a and angiotensin II type 1A receptor carboxyl-terminal tails (C-tails) were cloned into pEBG using BamHI and NotI restriction sites (23Anborgh P.H.

Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK 293 cells and COS7 cells were grown at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 μg/μl gentamicin. The mouse striatal cell lines expressing wild-type and mutant Htt were grown at 33 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Cells were transfected with plasmid cDNAs using a modified calcium phosphate method (24Ferguson S.S.G. Caron M.G. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 237: 121-126PubMed Google Scholar). After transfection (18 h), the cells were incubated with fresh medium, allowed to recover for 6-8 h, reseeded into 6-, 12-, or 24-well dishes, and then grown for an additional 18 h prior to experimentation. Primary Neuronal Cell Culture, Immunostaining, and Transfection—Neuronal cultures were prepared from cortex obtained from embryonic day-20 rat embryos. All animal procedures were approved by the University of Western Ontario Animal Care Committee. Cells were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated 50-mm glass coverslips in isolation medium for 4 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator to permit cell attachment. Isolation medium was subsequently replaced with serum-free culture medium, and the cells were cultured with medium replenished every 3 days. Isolation medium consisted of minimum Eagle's medium with Earle's salts supplemented with 2 mm Glutamax/glutamine, 10% heat-inactivated horse serum, 6 mg/ml glucose, 0.5 units/ml penicillin, 0.5 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 μm MK-801, and 25 mm KCl. Culture medium consisted of neurobasal medium supplemented with B-27, 2 mm Glutamax/glutamine, 0.5 units/ml penicillin, 0.5 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 μm MK-801, 25 mm KCl. Before experimentation, neurons were washed two times with HEPES-buffered saline solution (HBSS), and all of the experiments were performed using HBSS, which does not contain glutamate. Primary neuronal cultures 4 days in vitro were transfected with Effectene (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions (25Bhattacharya M. Babwah A.V. Godin C. Anborgh P.H. Dale L.B. Poulter M.O. Ferguson S.S.G. J. Neurosci. 2004; 24: 8752-8761Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Confocal microscopy was performed using a Zeiss LSM-510 META laser scanning microscope with a Zeiss 63X or 100X NA 1.4 oil immersion lens and filters with emission wavelengths of 488 and 514 nm as described previously (26Dale L.B.

Inositol Phosphate Formation—Inositol lipids were radiolabeled by incubating the cells overnight with 1 μCi/ml [3H]myo-inositol in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Unincorporated [3H]myo-inositol was removed by washing the cells with HBSS (116 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES, 11 mm glucose, 5 mm NaHCO3, 4.7 mm KCl, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 1.3 mm MgSO4, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4). The cells were preincubated for 1 h in HBSS at 37 °C and then preincubated in 500 μl of the same buffer containing 10 mm LiCl for an additional 10 min at 37 °C. The cells were then incubated in either the absence or the presence of increasing concentrations (0-30 mm) of quisqualate for 30 min at 37 °C. The reaction was stopped on ice by adding 500 μl of 0.8 m perchloric acid and then neutralized with 400 μl of 0.72 m KOH, 0.6 m KHCO3. The total [3H]inositol incorporated into the cells was determined by counting the radioactivity present in 50 μl of the cell lysate. Total inositol phosphate was purified from the cell extracts by anion exchange chromatography using Dowex 1-X8 (formate form) 200-400 mesh anion exchange resin. [3H]Inositol phosphate formation was determined by liquid scintillation using a Beckman LS 6500 scintillation system. Co-immunoprecipitation—Co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins from HdhQ7/Q7 striatal cells was performed using lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mg/ml leupeptin, 20 mg/ml aprotonin, and 20 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). mGluR5 was immunoprecipitated from striatal cell supernatant (500 μg of total protein) using 1.5 mg of mGluR5 rabbit polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology) and 1:75 OPTN rabbit polyclonal antibody. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were also performed using 500 μg of total cell lysate protein solubilized from HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with the various cDNA constructs as described in the legends to Figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. The cells were solubilized in lysis buffer. FLAG-mGluR1a and FLAG-mGluR5a were immunoprecipitated with FLAG-Sepharose beads from cell lysates by overnight rotation at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with lysis buffer, and proteins were eluted in 3× SDS sample buffer and then separated by SDS-PAGE. The membranes were blocked with 10% milk in wash buffer (TBS-T) (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, 0.05% Tween 20) and then incubated with rabbit GRK2-, OPTN-, or mGluR5-specific antibodies, as well as Htt-, myc-, FLAG-, or HA-specific monoclonal antibodies diluted 1:1000 in wash buffer containing 3% skim milk. The membranes were rinsed three times with wash buffer and then incubated with secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG or anti-mouse IgG (Amersham Biosciences) diluted 1:2500 in wash buffer containing 3% skimmed milk. Membranes were rinsed twice with TBS-T and twice with Tris-buffered saline and were incubated with ECL Western blotting detection reagents. Intensities of immunoblot signals were determined with the β4.0.2 version of the data acquisition and analysis software from Scion Corp. (Frederick, MD).FIGURE 2Inhibition of mGluR1a signaling by OPTN.

https://openalex.org/W2088698677,"Artemis protein has irreplaceable functions in V(D)J recombination and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) as a hairpin and 5′ and 3′ overhang endonuclease. The kinase activity of the DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) is necessary in activating Artemis as an endonuclease. Here we report that three basal phosphorylation sites and 11 DNA-PKcs phosphorylation sites within the mammalian Artemis are all located in the C-terminal domain. All but one of these phosphorylation sites deviate from the SQ or TQ motif of DNA-PKcs that was predicted previously from in vitro phosphorylation studies. Phosphatase-treated mammalian Artemis and Artemis that is mutated at the three basal phosphorylation sites still retain DNA-PKcs-dependent endonucleolytic activities, indicating that basal phosphorylation is not required for the activation. In vivo studies of Artemis lacking the C-terminal domain have been reported to be sufficient to complement V(D)J recombination in Artemis null cells. Therefore, the C-terminal domain may have a negative regulatory effect on the Artemis endonucleolytic activities, and phosphorylation by DNA-PKcs in the C-terminal domain may relieve this inhibition.

During this process, the variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) subexons are recombined to generate a functional variable domain exon coding for immunoglobulins and T cell receptors (1Bassing C.H.

V(D)J recombination begins with the binding of the RAG complex (RAG1, RAG2, and HMG1) to the recombination signal sequences. The RAG complex nicks between the coding end and the recombination signal sequences and converts the nicks to double-strand DNA breaks, thereby creating hairpin sealed coding ends and blunt signal ends (2Gellert M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2002; 71: 101-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar, 4Fugmann S.D. Lee A.I. Shockett P.E. Villey I.J. Schatz D.G. Annu. Rev.

Subsequently, the joining of the two coding ends is carried out by the general NHEJ machinery (6Lieber M.R. Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar).NHEJ factors include Ku (composed of the Ku70 and Ku86 subunits), DNA-PKcs, Artemis, and DNA ligase IV-XRCC4 complex (6Lieber M.R. Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 817-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 7Rooney S. Chaudhuri J. Alt F.W. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 200: 115-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The absence of any of these components in vivo typically results in an ionizing radiation sensitivity and severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) phenotype (8de Villartay J.P. Curr. Opin. Allergy Clin. Immunol. 2002; 2: 473-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Artemis is the most recent NHEJ factor discovered. It was cloned from human patients that have radiosensitivity and a SCID phenotype (RS-SCID) (9Moshous D. Callebaut I. de Chasseval R. Corneo B. Cavazzana-Calvo M. Le Deist F. Tezcan I. Sanal O. Bertrand Y. Philippe N. Fischer A. de Villartay J.P. Cell. 2001; 105: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). The hairpin opening (critical for V(D)J recombination) and 5′ and 3′ overhang processing (necessary for NHEJ) activities of Artemis explain the dual phenotype of the human patients (10Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 781-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). Animals missing Artemis also have the RS-SCID phenotype. The presence of unresolved coding end hairpins in these animals confirmed the pivotal role of Artemis in the hairpin opening step of V(D)J recombination (11Rooney S. Sekiguchi J. Zhu C. Cheng H.L.

The fact that human patients and animals deficient for the Artemis protein both have the RS-SCID phenotype suggests that other nucleases do not functionally fulfill the roles of Artemis.Artemis seems to recognize structural discontinuity of single- to double-strand DNA transitions. The activities of Artemis are regulated by association with and phosphorylation by DNA-PKcs. Artemis interacts with DNA-PKcs in vitro and in vivo in the absence of DNA and ATP, and it can only be activated as a hairpin and overhang endonuclease once it is phosphorylated by DNA-PKcs (10Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 781-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). It is still an open question how DNA-PKcs activates Artemis by phosphorylation.The N-terminal domain (amino acid 1–155, exons 1–6) of Artemis has significant homology to the β-lactamase fold of several members of the metallo-β-lactamase superfamily (9Moshous D. Callebaut I. de Chasseval R. Corneo B. Cavazzana-Calvo M. Le Deist F. Tezcan I. Sanal O. Bertrand Y. Philippe N. Fischer A. de Villartay J.P. Cell. 2001; 105: 177-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar) and contains multiple catalytically important residues (13Pannicke U. Ma Y. Hopfner K.P. Niewolik D. Lieber M.R. Schwarz K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1987-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 14Poinsignon C. Moshous D. Callebaut I. de Chasseval R. Villey I. de Villartay J.P. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Amino acids 156–385 (exons 7–13) of Artemis comprise the β-CASP region, found only in members of the metallo-β-lactamase superfamily that process nucleic acid (15Callebaut I. Moshous D. Mornon J.P. de Villartay J.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 3592-3601Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most interestingly, Artemis truncated for the C-terminal domain can functionally complement cells derived from an RS-SCID patient for V(D)J recombination (14Poinsignon C. Moshous D. Callebaut I. de Chasseval R. Villey I. de Villartay J.P. J. Exp. Med. 2004; 199: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Therefore, it seems that the metallo-β-lactamase domain and the β-CASP region together constitute the “catalytic core” of Artemis. However, the function of the remaining C-terminal domain (amino acids 386–692), composed of a single exon (exon 14), has yet to be determined.In this study, we have discovered 11 DNA-PKcs phosphorylation sites and 3 basal phosphorylation sites of Artemis, all of which are located within the C-terminal domain. Our data suggest that the uncharacterized C-terminal domain of Artemis has important regulatory roles. These results lead to a model for how DNA-PKcs activates Artemis by phosphorylation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESOligonucleotides—The 46-nt hairpin substrate (YM-164) has been described previously (Fig. 4A of Ref. 13Pannicke U. Ma Y. Hopfner K.P. Niewolik D. Lieber M.R. Schwarz K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1987-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The sequences of the 35-bp DNA used as a DNA-PKcs cofactor are the same as described (10Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 781-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar).Protein Expression Constructs—Wild-type Artemis expression plasmids were constructed as described (13Pannicke U. Ma Y. Hopfner K.P. Niewolik D. Lieber M.R. Schwarz K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1987-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The triple point mutant ARM49 (S385A, S516A, and S518A) as well as the other substitution mutants were generated using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA).For the ArtemisFLAG baculovirus, full-length Artemis containing a SapI site in front of its stop codon was generated and cloned into pENTR1a-TEV (a modified version pENTR1a (Invitrogen)). The resulting plasmid (pENTR1a-TEV-Artemis-SapI) was recombined with pDEST8-FLAG (a modified version of pDEST8 (Invitrogen), which contains a SapI site in front of a TEV protease recognition site followed by a FLAG epitope) vector using the Gateway system (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmid was digested with SapI and ligated back together to generate an in-frame fusion to the TEV cleavage site and the FLAG tag at the C terminus. This construct was then used in the Bac-to-Bac system (Invitrogen) to generate the baculovirus following the manufacturer's recommendation.In order to generate the mammalian expression plasmid for ArtemisFLAG, full-length Artemis was amplified by PCR using Pfu Turbo Hot Start polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and primers Artemis-Bam-HI.R (5′-CGCGGATCCCTACTTGTCATCGTCATCCTTGTAATCTGCGGTATCTAAGAGTGAGCATTTTCTTTT-3′) and Artemis-SbfI.R (5′-CATGCCTGCAGGATGAGTTCTTTCGAGGGGCAGATGG-3′). The PCR product was then cloned into the BamHI and SbfI sites of pEXAL1.1. The ArtemisFLAG insert was sequenced to confirm that no mutations were introduced during the cloning process. The DNA-PKcs expression plasmid pPK1 was constructed as described (16Kulesza P. DNA-dependent Protein Kinase in V(D)J Recombination.. Washington University, St. Louis1999Google Scholar).In Vivo V(D)J Recombination Assay—The cellular V(D)J recombination assay and FACS analysis of transfected cells were carried out as described (13Pannicke U. Ma Y. Hopfner K.P. Niewolik D. Lieber M.R. Schwarz K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1987-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar).Protein Purification—DNA-PKcs and Artemis-myc-His were purified as described (10Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 781-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). pEXAL1.1-ArtemisFLAG was transfected into 293T cells by calcium phosphate precipitation, and the cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Artemis-FLAG was immunoprecipitated as described (10Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 781-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar) with an anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma). The FLAG-tagged Artemis was left on the resin or, in the case that the protein was eluted, the immunobeads were washed three times in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm DTT, and then the protein was eluted by incubating the beads in 0.1 mg/ml of FLAG peptide (Sigma) in the same buffer for 1 h at 4°C with constant mixing. The supernatant was collected as the soluble ArtemisFLAG protein.Mass Spectrometry—Proteins to be analyzed were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250. The bands corresponding to the samples were excised, and the gel pieces were destained in 50% methanol. Next, the gel pieces were dehydrated in acetonitrile and rehydrated in 10 mm dithiothreitol (DTT) and 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate. Subsequently, the samples were alkylated in 50 mm iodoacetamide and 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate. The gel pieces were then dehydrated in acetonitrile, rehydrated in 0.1 m ammonium bicarbonate, dehydrated again in acetonitrile, and completely dried by vacuum centrifugation. Trypsinization of the dried pieces was carried out in 20 ng/μl trypsin in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate. The sample was digested overnight, and the peptides were extracted from the polyacrylamide in 2 aliquots of 50% acetonitrile, 5% formic acid.Trypsinized samples were analyzed with the liquid chromatography-MS system, which consisted of a Finnigan LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer system with a Protana nanospray ion source interfaced to a Phenomenex Jupiter 10-μm C18 reversed-phase capillary column. The data were analyzed by data base searching using the Sequest search algorithm. Peptides that were not matched by this algorithm were interpreted manually and searched versus the EST data bases using the Sequest algorithm.In Vitro Nuclease Assay—25 nm of the 5′-labeled substrate was incubated with 100 nm Artemis in 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.25 mm ATP, and 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin in a total volume of 10 μl. Where indicated, 50 nm DNA-PKcs and 0.25 μm of 35-bp DNA (nonspecific DNA-PKcs cofactor) were included in the reactions. Reactions were incubated for 1 h at 37°C and then denatured for 5 min at 100 °C in an equal volume of denaturing gel loading dye (98% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.025% of bromphenol blue, and 0.025% of xylene cyanol FF). Reaction mixtures were resolved by 12% denaturing PAGE, and the gel image was obtained with PhosphorImager SI445 (Amersham Biosciences).DNA-PKcs Phosphorylation and Phosphatase Dephosphorylation Assays—For the DNA-PKcs phosphorylation reactions, Artemis was incubated with DNA-PKcs in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 0.25 mm ATP, and 1 μm 35-bp DNA at 37 °C for 30 min. If the kinase reactions are followed by dephosphorylation, the Artemis immunobeads were washed in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 650 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 three times, and in 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm MgCl2, and 2 mm DTT twice, and the immunobeads were then aliquoted and treated with either λ protein phosphatase (λ PPase) (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) or calf intestine phosphatase (CIP) (Roche Applied Science) under conditions suggested by the vendor. DNA-PKcs or protein phosphatase-treated samples were resolved by 7 or 8% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue R-250.Immunoprecipitation Assay—The immunoprecipitation assay was done as described (10Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 781-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). DNA-PKcs was detected with anti-DNA-PKcs antibody 25-4 (Neomarkers, Fremont, CA). Myc-tagged Artemis was detected with anti-Myc antibody (Invitrogen). Equal transfection efficiencies were confirmed by co-transfection of an enhanced green fluorescent protein expression plasmid and FACS analysis. SV40 T-antigen was used as a sample loading control and was detected with an anti-SV40 T-Ag antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).RESULTSArtemis Can Be Phosphorylated at Multiple Positions in the C-terminal Domain by DNA-PKcs—DNA-PKcs is homologous to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases, yet in vitro it phosphorylates many protein targets on serine and threonine residues (17Smith G.C. Jackson S.P. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 916-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar, 18Meek K. Gupta S. Ramsden D.A. Lees-Miller S.P. Immunol. Rev. 2004; 200: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the DNA-PKcs kinase activity is necessary to activate Artemis as a hairpin and 5′ and 3′ overhang endonuclease (10Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 781-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar), and these activities are very likely to be critical to V(D)J recombination and NHEJ in vivo. We were interested in mapping the phosphorylation positions of Artemis by DNA-PKcs in vitro by mass spectrometry (MS). Artemis-myc-His immunobeads were incubated with DNA-PKcs under kinase permissive conditions and then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (see “Experimental Procedures”). In order to confirm that this in vitro phosphorylation system mimics other DNA-PKcs kinase reactions, we first analyzed the protein band corresponding to autophosphorylated DNA-PKcs. Nine phosphoserines and phosphothreonines were detected by MS (Fig. 1A). Six of these sites (Thr-2609, Ser-2612, Thr-2624, Thr-2638, Thr-2647, and Ser-3205) have been reported by Douglas et al. (19Douglas P. Sapkota G.P. Morrice N. Yu Y. Goodarzi A.A. Merkle D. Meek K. Alessi D.R. Lees-Miller S.P. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 243-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), and three (Ser-3821, Ser-4026, and Thr-4102) are novel.Next, the untreated and DNA-PKcs-phosphorylated mammalian Artemis was analyzed by MS. Whereas the untreated Artemis (purified from mammalian cells) has only 3 phosphorylated serines, the phosphorylated Artemis has 14 phosphorylated serines and threonines (including the three basal phosphorylated residues) (Fig. 1B). Because of the limitations of MS, phosphorylation positions on some of the adjacent serines or threonines cannot be definitively determined (see Fig. 1B). It was suggested previously that the DNA-PKcs consensus phosphorylation sites are serines or threonines followed by a glutamine (SQ or TQ) (20Anderson C.W. Carter T.H. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 217: 91-111PubMed Google Scholar). However, none of the Artemis phosphorylation sites by DNA-PKcs is at an SQ or TQ, despite the fact that there is a cluster of SQ and TQ sites in the C-terminal domain of Artemis (Fig. 1B). Only one of the basal phosphorylation sites within Artemis is at an SQ site (Ser-516).It is interesting that even untreated Artemis purified from human 293T cells has three basal phosphorylation sites. In order to determine whether this modification is conserved, human Artemis protein expressed from a baculovirus in insect cells was subjected to MS analysis. FLAG-tagged Artemis purified from insect cells is also phosphorylated at the three basal phosphorylation sites in addition to a fourth one (Fig. 1B). Therefore, the kinase activity that is responsible for the basal phosphorylation of Artemis exists in invertebrates.As an initial effort to screen for critical DNA-PKcs phosphorylation site(s) of Artemis, we mutated each serine or threonine residue located at SQ or TQ into an alanine residue (Ser to Ala or Thr to Ala mutations). Next, the 10 plasmids expressing different point mutants of Artemis were tested for their ability to functionally complement human primary skin fibroblasts deficient for Artemis in a V(D)J recombination assay (TABLE ONE) as described (13Pannicke U. Ma Y. Hopfner K.P. Niewolik D. Lieber M.R. Schwarz K. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1987-1997Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). All the mutants showed wild-type levels of complementation, indicating that mutations at these SQ and TQ sites individually do not have an effect on the functions of Artemis. This is in agreement with our finding that DNA-PKcs phosphorylation sites of Artemis are not at SQ or TQ sites (Fig. 1B).TABLE ONEV(D)J recombination assay in Artemis-deficient human primary skin fibroblasts complemented with Artemis serine or threonine point mutantsT.

Open table in a new tab Full-length Artemis Purified from Mammalian and Insect Cells Has DNA-PKcs-dependent Hairpin Opening and 5′ Overhang Processing Activities—It is interesting that insect cell-purified Artemis has similar basal phosphorylation as the mammalian cell-purified Artemis (Fig. 1B). We were interested in testing if the insect-cell derived Artemis is functional.Human Artemis expression constructs were introduced into different protein expression systems. FLAG-tagged Artemis from insect and mammalian cells were generated. Subsequently, the protein preparations from these sources were subjected to an in vitro nuclease assay. Artemis-FLAG purified from baculovirus-infected insect cells did demonstrate DNA-PKcs-dependent hairpin opening and 5′ overhang processing activities similar to the wild-type protein (Fig. 2, A and B, compare lanes 4 and 6).FIGURE 2Insect cell purified Artemis has wild-type DNA-PKcs-dependent endonucleolytic activities. C-terminally tagged Artemis was incubated with the substrate in the presence and absence of DNA-PKcs, and then the reaction mixtures were resolved by 12% denaturing PAGE. A, Artemis-FLAG immunobeads prepared from baculovirus-infected insect cells has exonucleolytic activity and DNA-PKcs-dependent hairpin and 5′ overhang processing activities. B, soluble Artemis-FLAG purified from mammalian cells has intrinsic exonucleolytic activity compared with the mock-purified protein. Lane M contains an oligonucleotide identical to the fragment 5′ to the hairpin tip (26 nt) of the substrate. The sizes (in nts) and the schematic representations of the products are indicated on the right.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the absence of DNA-PKcs, Artemis has exonucleolytic activity (Fig. 2, lanes 3 and 5). In order to rule out the possibility that the exonucleolytic activity was from a protein co-purifying with Artemis, C-terminally FLAG-tagged Artemis expression plasmid and the corresponding empty vector were transfected into mammalian cells. Proteins were purified by anti-FLAG antibody from both the Artemis-transfected and the mock-transfected cells. In this case, Artemis was eluted from the immunobeads (see “Experimental Procedures”) to minimize contamination from the agarose resin. Both protein preparations were assayed for hairpin opening activity (Fig. 2B), and only the protein preparation from Artemis-transfected cells showed significant exonucleolytic activity (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 5 and 7), suggesting that Artemis has intrinsic exonucleolytic activity.Phosphatase-treated Artemis Has Increased Gel Mobility—Although phosphorylation by DNA-PKcs is necessary to activate Artemis as an endonuclease, we were interested in whether basal phosphorylation at the three sites identified by MS plays a role in activating Artemis. To address this question, we first tested protein phosphatase-treated Artemis. Immunobead-immobilized Artemis-myc-His was first mock-treated or phosphorylated by DNA-PKcs. Then after extensive washes with a high salt buffer, each sample was divided into 5 aliquots and was mock-treated, treated with λ PPase, or treated with CIP (Fig. 3A). Finally, the phosphatase-treated immunobeads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining.FIGURE 3Artemis can be phosphorylated by DNA-PKcs and dephosphorylated by protein phosphatases in vitro. A, flow chart of phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Artemis-myc-His immunobeads. B, SDS-PAGE analysis and Coomassie staining of DNA-PKcs- and then protein phosphatase-treated Artemis. Mock-treated or DNA-PKcs-phosphorylated (3 pmol of DNA-PKcs) Artemis-myc-His (15 pmol) immunobeads were washed and divided into 5 aliquots. Each aliquot was then dephosphorylated by different amounts of λ PPase or CIP as indicated. Positions of autophosphorylated DNA-PKcs, CIP, λ PPase, immunoglobulin heavy chain (Ig H chain), and light chain (Ig L chain) are indicated by arrowheads. The position of Artemis changes with its phosphorylation status and is indicated by a bracket. The sizes of protein molecular weight standards (lane M, in kDa) are shown on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)As observed previously, untreated Artemis appears as a doublet after resolution by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3B, lane 1). However, after phosphatase treatment, the Artemis protein appeared less diffuse on the gel and migrated faster than the untreated protein (Fig. 3B, lanes 2–5). Compared with the untreated Artemis, DNA-PKcs-phosphorylated Artemis migrated even slower, and the resulting band (potentially consisting of multiple bands) appeared even more diffuse (Fig. 3B, lane 6). Phosphatase treatment of DNA-PKcs-phosphorylated Artemis restored the sharpness of the protein band and increased the mobility of the protein in the gel (Fig. 3B, lanes 7–10).We have reported that after treating the Artemis immunobeads with DNA-PKcs and extensive washing, the phosphorylated Artemis is not able to demonstrate any endonucleolytic activities (10Ma Y. Pannicke U. Schwarz K. Lieber M.R. Cell. 2002; 108: 781-794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (823) Google Scholar). We had suggested that this was because DNA-PKcs, which possibly recruits Artemis to the substrate, was washed away; the same washing buffer used in purifying Artemis by immunoprecipitation was sufficient to remove DNA-PKcs. We have now found that DNA-PKcs remains associated with the Artemis immunobeads after the phosphorylation and stringent washes (Fig. 3B, lanes 6–10). It is possible that DNA-PKcs or autophosphorylated DNA-PKcs has a higher affinity for phosphorylated Artemis.Phosphatase-treated Artemis Retains DNA-PKcs-dependent Endonucleolytic Activities—In order to study the role of basal phosphorylation on the activation of Artemis as an endonuclease, untreated, λ-PPase-treated, and CIP-treated Artemis immunobeads were prepared as described in Fig. 3A, and an aliquot of these beads was subjected to an in vitro nuclease assay in the presence or absence of DNA-PKcs. Mock-treated Artemis demonstrated DNA-PKcs-dependent hairpin opening, 5′ overhang processing activities (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 2), as well as 3′ overhang processing activity (Fig. 4B, lanes 7 and 8). Most interestingly, both λ-PPase-treated and the CIP-treated Artemis were able to demonstrate DNA-PKcs-dependent endonucleolytic activities at levels comparable with the untreated protein (Fig. 4, A and B, lanes 3–6 and 9–12).FIGURE 4Dephosphorylated Artemis-myc-His immunobeads still have DNA-PKcs-dependent endonucleolytic activities. Hairpin opening and 5′ overhang processing activity assay (A) and 3′ overhang processing activity assay (B) of the dephosphorylated Artemis are shown. Approximately 1 pmol of untreated, λ-PPase-, or CIP-treated Artemis was tested in a nuclease activity assay in the absence or presence of 0.5 pmol of DNA-PKcs. Positions and sizes (in nts) of the major products are indicated. The exonucleolytic product (1 nt) is indicated by exo. Diagrams adjacent to the arrows are depicted to emphasize the cleavage positions in the substrate that result in the corresponding products. The structures of the substrates are illustrated on the top, with an asterisk indicating the position of the radioactive labeling.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The Triple Point Mutant of Artemis at the Three Basal Phosphorylation Sites Has DNA-PKcs-dependent Endonucleolytic Activities—In order to confirm our phosphatase treatment studies of Artemis, a triple point mutant of Artemis was generated where all three basal phosphorylation sites (Ser-385, Ser-516, and Ser-518) were substituted by alanines (mutant ARM49). First, the ability of ARM49 to interact with DNA-PKcs w"

Exposed to ethanol vapour in a device known as an inebriometer (it looks like a glass condenser), they lose control of their posture and sink to the bottom of the tube within 20 minutes. Repeated alcohol consumption leads to tolerance, but not in flies with a newly identified mutation. Flies with this hangover mutation also have a shortened life span and are more susceptible to stresses such as heat and insecticides. There is growing recognition that cellular and systemic stress contributes to drug- and addiction-related behaviours in mammals, and these studies suggest that this role may be conserved in evolution. Repeated alcohol consumption leads to the development of tolerance, simply defined as an acquired resistance to the physiological and behavioural effects of the drug. This tolerance allows increased alcohol consumption, which over time leads to physical dependence and possibly addiction1,2,3. Previous studies have shown that Drosophila develop ethanol tolerance, with kinetics of acquisition and dissipation that mimic those seen in mammals. This tolerance requires the catecholamine octopamine, the functional analogue of mammalian noradrenaline4. Here we describe a new gene, hangover, which is required for normal development of ethanol tolerance. hangover flies are also defective in responses to environmental stressors, such as heat and the free-radical-generating agent paraquat. Using genetic epistasis tests, we show that ethanol tolerance in Drosophila relies on two distinct molecular pathways: a cellular stress pathway defined by hangover, and a parallel pathway requiring octopamine. hangover encodes a large nuclear zinc-finger protein, suggesting a role in nucleic acid binding. There is growing recognition that stress, at both the cellular and systemic levels, contributes to drug- and addiction-related behaviours in mammals. Our studies suggest that this role may be conserved across evolution."

https://openalex.org/W2084089214,"Ionizing radiation (IR) is an important environmental risk factor for various cancers and also a major therapeutic agent for cancer treatment. Exposure of mammalian cells to IR induces several types of damage to DNA, including double- and single-strand breaks, base and sugar damage, as well as DNA-DNA and DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs). Little is known regarding the biological consequences of DPCs. Identifying the proteins that become cross-linked to DNA by IR would be an important first step in this regard. We have therefore undertaken a proteomics study to isolate and identify proteins involved in IR-induced DPCs. DPCs were induced in AA8 Chinese hamster ovary or GM00637 human fibroblast cells using 0–4 gray of γ-rays under either aerated or hypoxic conditions. DPCs were isolated using a recently developed method, and proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. We identified 29 proteins as being cross-linked to DNA by IR under aerated and/or hypoxic conditions. The identified proteins include structural proteins, actin-associated proteins, transcription regulators, RNA-splicing components, stress-response proteins, cell cycle regulatory proteins, and GDP/GTP-binding proteins. The involvement of several proteins (actin, histone H2B, and others) in DPCs was confirmed by using Western blot analysis. The dose responsiveness of DPC induction was examined by staining one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gels with SYPRO Tangerine followed by analysis using fluorescence imaging.

Weinfeld M. Murray D. Mutat. Res. 2005; 589: 111-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Measurements of the amount of DNA damage induced by IR indicate that, in a mammalian cell, a 1-Gy exposure induces 1,000–2,000 damaged bases, 800–1,600 damaged sugars, 500–1,000 single-strand breaks, 200–300 alkali-labile sites, 20–40 double-strand breaks, ∼30 DNA-DNA cross-links, and ∼150 DPCs (2Friedberg E.C.

Zhitkovich A. Carcinogenesis. 2000; 21: 1573-1580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This removal is a reflection of both chemical instability and enzymatic repair processes.

Acta. 1977; 477: 343-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) demonstrated the induction of DPCs by this agent in aerated mammalian cells. IR has also been shown to induce DPCs in hypoxic mammalian cells and to do so more efficiently (1.5–5.5-fold) than in aerated cells (8Meyn R.E. Jenkins W.T. Murray D. Simic M.G. Grossman L.

Res. 1987; 109: 419-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In addition, cells that are deficient in some DNA repair factors related to cross-link removal show an increased sensitivity to the cytotoxic effects of IR under hypoxic, but not aerated, conditions (14Murray D. Macann A. Hanson J. Rosenberg E. Int. J. Radiat. Biol. 1996; 69: 319-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). An interesting implication of these observations is that abrogating the repair of DPCs might be clinically advantageous in radiation therapy because this could render hypoxic tumor cells more radiosensitive (15Hockel M. Vaupel P. Semin. Oncol. 2001; 28: 36-41Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Vaupel P. Kelleher D.K. Hockel M. Semin. Oncol. 2001; 28: 29-35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, there are many questions to answer before such a therapeutic strategy might be realized. For example, how are DPCs repaired? How does the presence of a DPC activate a particular repair pathway? Is there a specific damage-recognition event and, if so, is it protein-specific or is it a general mechanism, such as blockage of the progression of protein complexes that mediate various DNA transactions? What are the biological consequences of unrepaired DPCs? Identifying the actual proteins involved in these DPCs may help to answer these questions. As well, high doses (typically >30 Gy) have been used in previous studies to measure DPCs. The effect of oxygen on DPC induction at low, clinically relevant, doses has not yet been examined. To date, various methods (nitrocellulose filter binding, polycarbonate filter trapping, SDS/K+ precipitation, and others (1Barker S.L. Weinfeld M. Murray D. Mutat. Res. 2005; 589: 111-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar)) have been used to quantitate and/or isolate IR-induced DPCs with varying levels of success. Trying to purify DPCs by any method that isolates all cellular proteins is clearly going to be noninformative for protein identification, whereas an approach that isolates DPCs by first isolating the DNA should be useful in combination with protein identification methods such as mass spectrometry (MS). Although MS is a sensitive technique, it is possible that only a small percentage of the ∼30,000 proteins in the cell can be significantly cross-linked to DNA, so it is essential to obtain a high yield of these proteins with very little contamination in order to identify them. Accordingly, we developed a novel method for the isolation of proteins covalently cross-linked to DNA that yields a sufficient quantity of protein for MS analysis (17Barker S.L. Murray D. Zheng J. Li L. Weinfeld M. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 344: 204-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In this study, we have employed this method to purify IR-induced DPCs from mammalian cells, and we have combined this method with MS identification of the isolated proteins. We have also examined the dose dependence of IR-induced DPCs, and we have confirmed the involvement of some of these proteins in IR-induced DPCs by using immunological techniques. Cell Culture—The parental Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line, AA8, was obtained from Dr. Keith Caldecott (University of Sussex, UK) and maintained as a monolayer culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's α-medium/F-12 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% penicillin/streptomycin in a humidified 5% CO2 and 95% air atmosphere at 37 °C. The human fibroblast cell line, GM00637, was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained as a monolayer culture in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's α-medium/F-12 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 5% penicillin/streptomycin as above. Radiation and Chemical Treatment of Cells—Cells were grown as monolayer cultures to ∼85% confluency. Aerated cells were irradiated in 150-mm plastic dishes. To render cells hypoxic (18Koch C.J. Stobbe C.C. Bump E.A. Radiat. Res. 1984; 98: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), the cultures were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and trypsinized. Fresh medium was added to a final volume of 5 ml per 2.4 × 107 cells, and the cells were transferred to 60-mm glass Petri dishes. The dishes were placed in air-tight aluminum chambers, and the chambers were evacuated using a vacuum manifold. The chambers were then filled with pure nitrogen gas, and the cells were incubated at room temperature in nitrogen for 8 s, with the process being repeated four times. This process was repeated another four times using 8-min incubations, and the cells were then incubated at 37 °C for 20 min to allow them to metabolize residual oxygen (adapted from Ref. 18Koch C.J. Stobbe C.C. Bump E.A. Radiat. Res. 1984; 98: 141-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). For IR treatments, cells were irradiated in a 60Co irradiator (Gamma-cell; Atomic Energy of Canada Limited, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada) at a dose rate of 0.1 Gy/s. For formaldehyde treatment, 37% formaldehyde was added to the growth medium to a final concentration of 1%, and the sample was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. Quantitation of DNA—The UV absorbance at 260 nm was measured for each sample to determine the DNA concentration after DNA digestion. A value of 32 μg/ml per 1 OD unit was used to calculate the amount of DNA in each sample. The amount of DNA in each sample was determined and used to equalize sample loads within each experiment for SDS-PAGE analysis. The 260/280 nm absorbance ratios were also determined. Ratios of 1.5–1.7 were invariably obtained, indicating that the contribution of protein to the 260 nm reading was insignificant. Also, wavelength scans from 230 to 320 nm were examined to verify the purity of DNA samples. For optimization experiments, the amount of DNA (and absence of RNA) was also assessed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining (19Maniatis T. Fritsch E.S. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 9.32-9.33Google Scholar). Nuclei Isolation—Cells were trypsinized at room temperature for 3 min and collected by centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. Cells were washed in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and collected by centrifugation at 200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The cell pellet was gently resuspended in Buffer 1 (400 μl per 107 cells) using a wide-bore pipette tip (Buffer 1: 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 100 mm EDTA, 100 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma)). Cells were chilled on ice for 15 min and then lysed by the addition of 0.6% (v/v) Nonidet P-40 and mixing by inversion. Nuclei were pelleted at 200 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was removed. Nuclear Extract Preparation—Nuclear extracts of CHO AA8 cells were prepared for control purposes. After nuclei isolation (above), the pellet was resuspended gently in ice-cold Buffer 2 (100 μl per 107 cells) using a wide-bore pipette tip (Buffer 2: 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma), and 10% (v/v) glycerol) and incubated, with shaking, at 4 °C for 30 min. The lysate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was aliquoted into ice-cold Eppendorf tubes, supplemented with 0.025 mg/ml leupeptin, and aliquots were flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C. DNAzol-Strip DPC Isolation Method—We followed the protocol of Barker et al. (17Barker S.L. Murray D. Zheng J. Li L. Weinfeld M. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 344: 204-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Nuclei were lysed by the addition of 500 μl DNAzol per 7.2 × 107 of cells. The DNA was precipitated using 0.5 volume of ice-cold 99% ethanol. The pellets were air-dried and resuspended in 8 mm NaOH (3 ml per 9 × 106 cells) at 37 °C. An equal volume of 5 m urea was added, and the samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min on a rotating shaker. 10% SDS was added to a final concentration of 2%, and samples were incubated as above. The solute level and volume were reduced by desalting the samples with distilled water and concentrating using a 15-ml 3-kDa cut-off Centricon concentrator (Fisher) and by centrifuging the samples at 2500 × g at 4 °C. When the volume had been reduced to ∼5 ml, an equal volume of 5 m NaCl was added. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min on a rotating shaker, concentrated, and desalted with water as above. The DNA from each sample was re-precipitated by the addition of 0.1 volume of 3 m sodium acetate and 3 volumes of ice-cold 99% ethanol. Precipitated DNA was collected by centrifugation at 200 × g at 4 °C for 30 min and dried. The DNA was dissolved in 8 mm NaOH (3 ml per 9 × 106 cells). For DNA digestion, digestion buffer (1 ml of 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ZnCl2, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0) was added to each sample, and the samples were digested for 1 h at 37 °C with 5 units of DNase I (Sigma) and 5 units of S1 nuclease (Invitrogen). After digestion, the DNA concentration was determined by UV absorbance. The samples were washed with distilled deionized water (3 × 10 ml) and concentrated (to 1 ml) in a 15-ml 5-kDa cut-off Centricon concentrator and reduced to dryness by vacuum centrifugation. DNAzol-Silica DPC Isolation Method—Again, we followed the method of Barker et al. (17Barker S.L. Murray D. Zheng J. Li L. Weinfeld M. Anal. Biochem. 2005; 344: 204-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The method of Elphinstone et al. (20Elphinstone M.S. Hinten G.N. Anderson M.J. Nock C.J. Mol. Ecol. Notes. 2003; 3: 317-320Crossref Scopus (259) Google Scholar) was used to prepare the silica fines. Silica fines (VWR, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) were heated to near boiling in 5 m nitric acid, rinsed three times with distilled water, and resuspended in an equal volume of distilled water. The pH of the solution was adjusted to ∼7.0 using 1 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and the silica fines were sedimented, resuspended in an equal volume of deionized water, and autoclaved. After lysing the nuclei with DNAzol, 2 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, at 65 °C was added, and each sample was drawn through a 21-gauge needle three times then through a 25-gauge needle three times to shear the DNA. NaCl was added to a final concentration of 4 m, and the mixture was incubated at 37 °C with shaking for 20 min. Urea was added to a final concentration of 4 m, and the samples were incubated as above. An equal volume of 99% ethanol was added to each sample. The silica slurry was then added (1 ml per 7.2 × 107 cells), and the samples were gently rocked for 20 min at room temperature to allow for binding. The silica was collected by gentle centrifugation, and the supernatant was discarded. The silica was washed three times in 50% ethanol and collected by gentle centrifugation each time. The DNA was eluted two times using 2 ml of 8 mm NaOH at 65 °C for 5 min, and eluates were combined. For DNA digestion, 1 ml of digestion buffer (10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm ZnCl2, 0.1 m sodium acetate, pH 5.0) was added to each sample, and the samples were digested with DNase I and S1 nucleases as above. After digestion, the DNA concentration was determined by UV absorbance. The samples were washed with distilled deionized water (3 × 10 ml) and concentrated (to 1 ml) in a 15-ml 5-kDa cut-off Centricon concentrator and reduced to dryness by vacuum centrifugation. SDS-PAGE Analysis—Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad) was added to each sample in amounts determined to equalize the DNA concentration of each sample. Samples were analyzed by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE using 15% separating gels (for MS analysis) or pre-cast 10–20% gradient gels (Bio-Rad) in later experiments. In separate experiments, gels were stained using either ammonia-silver nitrate or SYPRO Tangerine (Invitrogen). Quantitation of Protein on SDS-Polyacrylamide Gels—SYPRO Tangerine-stained one-dimensional SDS-polyacrylamide gels were scanned using a Typhoon 7400 imager (GE Healthcare). These images were analyzed using the ImageQuant 5.2 software (GE Healthcare) by measuring the fluorescence signal. Known quantities of broad range marker proteins (Bio-Rad) were run on each gel and stained with SYPRO-Tangerine. Representative background regions were subtracted for each band, and marker bands were quantified. Quantitation was based on comparison to the fluorescence signal in the marker protein bands after subtraction of representative background regions. Linear regression analysis was performed using the Prism software and analysis of variance and single factor analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel. Protein Identification by Mass Spectrometry—Protein bands excised from silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels were reduced with dithiothreitol, carbamidomethylated using iodoacetamide, and digested ingel with trypsin. The resulting peptides were analyzed on a Bruker REFLEX III time of flight mass spectrometer (serial number FM 2413, Bremen/Leipzig, Germany), and the obtained peptide mass maps were searched against data bases to identify proteins (peptide mass mapping). Furthermore, selected peptides were fragmented on a PE Sciex API-QSTAR Pulsar mass spectrometer (serial number K0940105, MDS-Sciex, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) to acquire MS/MS spectra, which contain sequence-specific information, and were then subjected to data base searching (MS/MS ion search) to either confirm the previously acquired results from the peptide mass mapping or to identify proteins if no positive results were obtained by peptide mapping. The MASCOT search engine (www.matrixscience.com/search_form_select.html) was used for both peptide mass mapping and MS/MS ion searching. Data base search criteria are listed below. Two of the most up-to-date and complete proteome data bases, Swiss-Prot, and NCBInr, were selected in our data base search. Mass tolerance was set according to instrument mass accuracy. For peptide mass mapping, the peptide mass tolerance was set at 100 ppm. For MS/MS ion searching, the mass tolerance was set at 0.3 Da for both the parent ion and fragment ions. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was set as a fixed modification, whereas methionine oxidation was set as a variable modification. Western Blots—Cross-linked proteins isolated by the DNAzol-silica method were resuspended in Laemmli Buffer, equalized for total amounts of DNA, separated on 10–20% gradient gels, and stained with SYPRO Tangerine protein stain. Gels were visualized by scanning with the Typhoon 7400 instrument. Gels were then destained briefly in 10% methanol and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) for 1.5 h at 4 °C and 80 V. Blots were blocked in 5% milk/Tris-buffered saline with 0.5% Tween (TBST) for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. After overnight incubation (4 °C) with primary antibody, the blots were washed four times (15 min per wash) in 10 ml of 5% milk/TBST at room temperature. Secondary antibodies were incubated with the blots for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. After the secondary antibody incubation, the blots were washed again as above, with a final wash in phosphate-buffered saline. Blots were developed using chemiluminescent reagents by mixing equal portions of the two reagents and incubating each blot with 1 ml of prepared reagent for 5 min at room temperature. Signals were captured using X-Omat K film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The films were scanned as image files, and the optical densities of the bands in these image files were quantified using the ImageJ software/shareware available from the NIH (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Alternatively, fluorescent secondary antibodies were used, and the blots were analyzed using a LI-COR Odyssey infra-red imager and the ImageJ software to quantitate the band optical densities. The average relative band intensities were plotted after normalizing the most intense signal of the irradiated samples within each determination as 100%. Antibodies—Primary polyclonal antibodies to mammalian vimentin, histone H2B, histone H4, actin, cofilin, hnRNP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), and HSP10 were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Primary monoclonal antibody to tubulin was also obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Primary monoclonal antibody to mammalian (mouse) ninein was generously provided by Dr. Gordon Chan (Department of Oncology, University of Alberta). Polyclonal anti-polynucleotide kinase (PNK) antibody has been described previously (21Fanta M. Zhang H. Bernstein N. Glover M. Karimi-Busheri F. Weinfeld M. Hybridoma. 2001; 20: 237-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Primary antibodies to hnRNP A3 and C1/C2 were generously provided by Dr. Gideon Dreyfuss (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine). Secondary antibodies, peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat and goat anti-rabbit, were also obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Primary antibodies were used at dilutions of 1:1,000 in 5% milk/TBST in a total volume of 3 ml. Fluorescently tagged secondary antibodies, goat anti-rabbit IR800, rabbit anti-goat 700, were obtained from Rockland Immunologicals (Gilbertsville, PA) and used at a dilution of 1:5,000 in 5% milk-TBST in a total volume of 5 ml. Isolation and PAGE Analysis of IR-induced DPCs in Hamster and Human Cells—CHO AA8 cells were exposed to 0 or 1 Gy of γ-radiation under either aerated or hypoxic conditions, and DPCs were isolated using the DNAzol-Strip method. Sample volumes were normalized for the amount of DNA isolated, and cross-linked proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. Fig. 1 shows a representative composite gel from these analyses. In the unirradiated sample (Fig. 1, aerated 0 Gy) very little protein was detected, confirming that this method successfully strips the DNA of associated proteins and that we are in fact isolating predominantly covalently cross-linked proteins following IR exposure. This level of isolated protein can be compared with that isolated from irradiated cells (Fig. 1, aerated 1 Gy) or from formaldehydetreated cells (Fig. 1, F) where each lane contains a greater number and intensity of bands than the control. Fig. 1 shows similar data for hypoxic cells. Compared with aerated cells, more protein was isolated from the hypoxic untreated sample (Fig. 1, hypoxic 0 Gy), indicating that removal of oxygen leads to modestly increased background DPC induction, although the level of protein was still quite low. Several protein bands observed in the hypoxic irradiated samples were not detected or were less intense in the aerated-irradiated samples (Fig. 1, hypoxic 1 Gy). The IR-induced cross-linking of proteins to DNA was also examined in human GM00637 fibroblasts. Cells received 0 or 4 Gy of IR under either aerated or hypoxic conditions, and DPCs were isolated using the DNAzol-Strip method. Again, analysis of isolated proteins by SDS-PAGE and silver staining (a representative composite gel is shown in Fig. 2) revealed that little protein was isolated from the unirradiated control samples and that a greater number and intensity of bands were observed in the irradiated samples. Identification of Proteins Involved in IR-induced DPCs in Hamster Cells—To identify cross-linked proteins, protein bands were excised from several gels. Some of the sample bands that were excised for MS analysis are indicated in Fig. 1 (A1–3 and H1–11). Although similar patterns of bands were seen in different experiments, band selection for MS analysis was based on the intensity and sharpness of band staining in an individual gel. The more intensely and sharply stained bands were chosen as they were more likely to yield a positive identification in MS analysis. As described under “Materials and Methods,” the search engine, Mascot, was used for protein identification by searching MS data against primary sequence data bases. Mascot uses a statistical scoring algorithm, mowse score, to calculate the matching scores that represent the identification significance. According to its calculation, significance thresholds vary between peptides in the search. Therefore, in our results both mowse scores and significance thresholds are considered. MS/MS spectra were also manually inspected to ensure that the identifications were reasonable and confident. In some cases, the score of a single peptide may be low (lower than the threshold), but correlation with other identified peptides from the same protein and peptide mass mapping results increased the confidence of the identification. If the Mascot MS/MS ion search did not yield positive results (due to internal or side chain fragmentation that Mascot does not account for), a potential peptide match was submitted to the MS product (prospector.ucsf.edu/) program, and the theoretical fragments of the peptide were compared with those shown in the MS/MS spectrum. To date, we have identified 29 proteins involved in IR-induced DPCs (TABLE ONE). TABLE ONE shows the protein identification results as follows: identified proteins, sequences of peptides selected for MS/MS experiments, peptide masses, Mascot scores for MS/MS ion searches, and the corresponding significance thresholds. Some of the identified proteins were from bands excised from the gel shown in Fig. 1. Tubulin α-6 chain was identified by peptide mass mapping and confirmed by manually matching the MS/MS spectrum with the theoretical fragments. Ninein was identified by peptide mass mapping only because of the unavailability of MS/MS instrumentation at that time.TABLE ONEProteins identified in IR-induced DNA-protein cross-links Note: most peptides were detected in multiple experiments, and modified peptides were also detected (oxidized, acetylated, etc.).ProteinPeptides subjected to MS/MSPeptide massMascot scoreSignificance thresholdAeratedaThe DPC isolation and protein identification experiments were carried out seven times.

These peptides belong to a multifunctional group of molecules that apart from their antibacterial activities also interact with mammalian cells and glycosaminoglycans and control chemotaxis, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Here we demonstrate a novel antimicrobial activity of the heparin-binding and cell-binding domain 5 of high molecular weight kininogen. Antimicrobial epitopes of domain 5 were characterized by analysis of overlapping peptides. A peptide, HKH20 (His479-His498), efficiently killed the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the Gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis. Fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy demonstrated that HKH20 binds to and induces breaks in bacterial membranes. Furthermore, no discernible hemolysis or membrane-permeabilizing effects on eukaryotic cells were noted. Proteolytic degradation of high molecular weight kininogen by neutrophil-derived proteases as well as the metalloproteinase elastase from P. aeruginosa yielded fragments comprising HKH20 epitopes, indicating that kininogen-derived antibacterial peptides are released during proteolysis.

Many AMPs, by virtue of their cationicity and amphipathicity, also interact with heparin (22Andersson E. Rydengård V. Sonesson A. Mörgelin M. Björck L. Schmidtchen A. Eur. J.

High molecular weight kininogen (HMWK) is a multifunctional 120-kDa glycoprotein found in plasma (∼80 μg/ml) (24Colman R.W. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1997; 90: 3819-3843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in α-granules of platelets (25Schmaier A.H. Zuckerberg A. Silverman C. Kuchibhotla J. Tuszynski G.P. Colman R.W. J. Clin. Investig. 1983; 71: 1477-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The protein is composed of six domains, each having different properties and specific ligands (24Colman R.W. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1997; 90: 3819-3843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Domains D1-D3 have a cystatin-like structure, and the two latter domains serve as specific inhibitors of cysteine proteinases such as cathepsins and calpains. The D4 domain contains the bradykinin sequence, which is released by plasma kallikreins during contact activation (24Colman R.W. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1997; 90: 3819-3843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Kaplan A.P. Joseph K. Silverberg M. J. Allergy Clin.

Biologically active kinins can also be generated by the cooperative action of mast cell tryptase and neutrophil elastase (27Kozik A. Moore R.B. Potempa J. Imamura T. Rapala-Kozik M. Travis J. J.

Thus, similar to complement degradation, limited proteolysis of HMWK generates highly vasoactive and proinflammatory peptides, which are formed at sites of tissue injury and inflammation.

Kurachi K. Takasawa T. Shiokawa H. Sasaki M. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5691-5697Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). The starting point for this study was the observation that this domain of HMWK shares many structural (cationicity and spacing of basic residues) and functional features with AMPs. Here we show that recombinant domain 5 (rD5) and related peptide epitopes, as well as HMWK cleavage products, function as “classical” AMPs, thus disclosing a previously unknown antibacterial activity of domain 5 of HMWK. Biological Materials—Blood drawn from healthy volunteers (Vacutainer tubes, BD Biosciences, containing 2 mg/ml K3EDTA) was used for preparation of erythrocytes and EDTA plasma. For preparation of citrate plasma, Vacutainer tubes containing 1:9 (v/v) 129 mm sodium citrate were used. The plasma was separated from the blood by centrifugation at 2500 × g in 15 min. The pellet was removed, and the plasma samples were stored at -20 °C. HaCaT keratinocytes were kindly provided by Dr. Robert Fusenig (Heidelberg University, Heidelberg, Germany) and were cultured in DMEM containing 5.5 mm glucose and 10% fetal calf serum. Polyclonal rabbit antibodies raised against HKH20 were purchased from Innovagen AB, Lund, Sweden. Neutrophils were prepared by routine procedures (Polymorphprep™, AXIS-SHIELD PoC AS, Oslo, Norway) from blood of healthy human donors. The cells were disrupted by freeze thawing and the addition of 0.3% Tween 20. Peptides/Proteins and Enzymes—HMWK was obtained from the Binding Site inc. (San Diego, CA). The synthetic peptides, KHN20, GHG20, GHG21, GGH20, HKH20, LDD40, Texas Red-conjugated HKH20, GKH17 (Fig. 1B), and LL-37 (LLGDFFRKSKEK-IGKEFKR IVQRIKDFLRNLVPRTES), were synthesized by Innovagen AB. The purity (>95%) and molecular weight of these peptides were confirmed by mass spectral analysis (MALDI-TOF Voyager, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Neutrophil serine protease, human leukocyte elastase (0.2 μg/μl, 5.8 milliunits/μl) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa elastase (0.05 μg/μl, 13.05 milliunits/μl) were obtained from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). An equivalent P. aeruginosa elastase (62 milliunits/μl) was kindly provided by Dr. H. Maeda, Kumamoto University. Purification of the Recombinant Domain 5—The expression vector (pET25b) (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI) containing rD5 was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3), generously provided by Dr. U. Sjöbring (32Herwald H. Mörgelin M. Svensson H.G. Sjöbring U. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 396-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). One millimolar isopropyl thio-β-d-galactoside was added to exponentially growing bacteria to induce protein production. After a 3-h incubation at 30 °C, bacteria were harvested by centrifugation (2800 × g for 10 min), and the pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of sonication buffer (s-buffer: 50 mm phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, pH 8.0). The bacteria were lysed by repeated cycles of freeze thawing. The lysate was centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 30 min, and the supernatant was mixed with 2 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-Sepharose (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany), equilibrated with s-buffer, and incubated on rotation for 1 h at room temperature. The Sepharose gel was loaded into a column and washed with 10 ml of s-buffer containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 ml of s-buffer, 5 ml of s-buffer with 1 m NaCl, 5 ml of s-buffer, 10 ml of 20% ethanol, 10 ml of s-buffer containing 5 mm imidazole, and finally 10 ml of s-buffer with 30 mm imidazole. The rD5 protein was eluted with s-buffer containing 500 mm imidazole. Molecular Modeling—A model structure of rD5 (Fig. 1A) was created based on the homologous protein hisactophilin from Dictyostelium discoideum (Protein Data Bank code 1HCE (33Habazettl J. Gondol D. Wiltscheck R. Otlewski J. Schleicher M. Holak T.A. Nature. 1992; 359: 855-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar)). The sequence of human rD5 (residues 414-525) was aligned against the sequence of hisactophilin using the alignment described in Ref. 34Colman R.W. Jameson B.A. Lin Y. Johnson D. Mousa S.A. Blood. 2000; 95: 543-550Crossref PubMed Google Scholar. The modeling was performed using the Prime module (35Jacobson M.P. Pincus D.L. Rapp C.S. Day T.J. Honig B. Shaw D.E. Friesner R.A. Proteins. 2004; 55: 351-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar) from the Schrödinger computational chemistry suite of programs (Schrödinger, LLC, Portland, OR). The sequence identity was 32%, and rotamers from the conserved residues were retained. Terminal tails and residues not derived from the template were minimized during structure building. All loops were refined one at a time using default sampling in the loop refinement protocol built into Prime. Most of the backbone torsion angles for nonglycine residues lie within allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The few non-glycine residues outside these regions (Trp18, Gln38, and His92) are located in loop regions. Microorganisms—E. coli strain BL21(DE3) was used for expression of the rD5-containing vector. E. coli 37.4, Enterococcus faecalis 2374, and P. aeruginosa 15159 isolates were originally obtained from patients with chronic venous ulcers. Radial Diffusion Assay—Radial diffusion assays (RDA) were performed essentially as described previously (36Lehrer R.I. Rosenman M. Harwig S.S. Jackson R. Eisenhauer P. J. Immunol.

Briefly, bacteria were grown to mid-logarithmic phase in 10 ml of full-strength (3% w/v) trypticase soy broth (BD Biosciences). The microorganisms were then washed once with 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4. 4 × 106 bacterial colony-forming units were added to 5 ml of the underlay agarose gel, consisting of 0.03% (w/v) trypticase soy broth, 1% (w/v) low electroendosmosis-type agarose (Sigma-Aldrich), and 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich). The underlay was poured into a 85-mm diameter Petri dish. After agarose solidification, 4-mm diameter wells were punched, and 6 μl of test sample was added to each well. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h to allow diffusion of the peptides. The underlay gel was then covered with 5 ml of molten overlay (6% trypticase soy broth and 1% low electroendosmosistype agarose in dH2O). Antimicrobial activity of a peptide was visualized as a zone of clearance around each well after 18-24 h of incubation at 37 °C. Screening for antimicrobial activity of peptides derived from domain 5 (KHN20, GHG20, GHG21, GGH20, HKH20, GKH17, all at 100 μm) was performed against E. coli. For comparison, we used LL-37 (100 μm) (Fig. 2B). The zones of E. coli clearance generated by different concentrations (10, 50, 100 μm) of rD5 and HKH20 were compared with the same concentrations of LL-37 (Fig. 2C). The dose-response characteristics of RDA were used to determine the minimal effective concentration (MEC) of HKH20 against P. aeruginosa. The log10 concentrations of HKH20 were plotted versus the respective diameter of the zone of clearance (not shown). Linear regression using least squares was used to estimate the MEC value, which was determined by triplicate experiments using eight serial 2-fold dilutions (starting at 512 μm) of HKH20. HMWK degradation products were tested for inhibitory effects against E. coli (Fig. 6A). The proteases (incubated for 1 h at 37 °C), used at equivalent concentrations as in the HMWK degradations, were added as controls. Using RDA (E. coli), zones of clearance generated by LDD40 and LL-37, respectively, were compared (Fig. 6F).FIGURE 6Generation of antimicrobial peptides by degradation of HMWK. A, inhibitory effects of HMWK cleavage products were visualized as zones of bacterial clearance in RDA. Cleavages of HMWK were performed for 10 and 30 min at 37 °C (see “Experimental Procedures”). 1, control, P. aeruginosa elastase (PAELA); 2, control, human leukocyte (neutrophil) elastase (HLE); 3, control, polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN); 4, control, HMWK; 5 and 6, HMWK incubated with P. aeruginosa elastase for 10 and 30 min, respectively; 7 and 8, HMWK incubated with human leukocyte elastase for 10 and 30 min, respectively; 9 and 10, HMWK incubated with polymorphonuclear neutrophils for 10 and 30 min, respectively. RDA was performed in low salt conditions. E. coli (4 × 106 cfu) was used as the test organism. Each 4 mm-diameter well was loaded with 6 μl of sample. A negative control, containing buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4), was included in the well at the top left of the plate.

Bacteria were washed and diluted in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 5 mm glucose. Bacteria (50 μl; 2 × 106 cfu/ml) were incubated at 37 °C for 2 h with rD5 protein (Fig. 2A), HKH20 (Fig. 2D), or LDD40 (Fig. 6E) peptide at the concentrations indicated in the figures. To test the time dependence of bacterial killing, 30 μm HKH20 was used against E. faecalis and 0.6 μm HKH20 against P. aeruginosa, and incubations were performed for 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min (Fig. 3C). Activity of 10 μm HKH20 was also tested against P. aeruginosa diluted in 10 mm Tris, 0.15 m NaCl +/- 20% human EDTA plasma. Significance was determined by using the Holm-Sidak method and one-way repeated measures analysis of variance. The statistical software used was SigmaStat, (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) (Fig. 4).FIGURE 4Antibacterial activities of HKH20 under physiological conditions. P. aeruginosa bacteria were subjected to 10 μm HKH20 in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl in the presence or absence of 20% human EDTA plasma.

Heparin Binding Assay—The rD5 protein and the synthetic HKH20 peptide (1, 2, 5 μm) were applied onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond™-C, Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, 3% bovine serum albumin) for 1 h and incubated with radiolabeled heparin (125I) (∼10 μg/ml) (22Andersson E. Rydengård V. Sonesson A. Mörgelin M. Björck L. Schmidtchen A. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 1219-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Unlabeled heparin (6 mg/ml) was added for competition of binding. The membranes were washed (three times for 10 min in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4). A Bas 2000 radioimaging system (Fuji) was used for visualization of radioactivity. Electron Microscopy—Suspensions of P. aeruginosa (16 × 106 per sample) were incubated for 2 h at 37 °CwiththeHKH20 peptide at 0.03 and 60 μm. As control, we included untreated bacteria. Each sample was gently transferred onto poly-l-lysine-coated Nylaflo® (Gelman Sciences) nylon membranes. The membranes were fixed in 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.2, for 2 h at 4°C and subsequently washed with 0.15 m cacodylate, pH 7.2. They were then postfixed with 1% osmium tetroxide (w/v) and 0.15 m sodium cacodylate, pH 7.2, for 1 h at 4°C, washed, and subsequently dehydrated in ethanol and further processed for Epon embedding. Sections were cut with a microtome and mounted on Formvar-coated copper grids. The sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined in a Jeol 1200 EX transmission electron microscope operated at 60 kV accelerating voltage (Fig. 3B). Fluorescence Microscopy—P. aeruginosa bacteria were grown to mid-logarithmic phase in Todd-Hewitt medium. The bacteria were washed twice in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4. The pellet was dissolved to yield a suspension of 5 × 106 cfu/ml in the same buffer. Two hundred microliters of the bacterial suspension was incubated with 1 μg of Texas Red-conjugated HKH20 on ice for 5 min and washed twice in 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4. To test whether heparin inhibits the binding of peptide to bacteria, Texas Red-HKH20 was incubated on ice for 5 min with an excess of heparin (50 μg) prior to the incubation with bacteria. The bacteria were fixed by incubation on ice for 15 min and at room temperature for 45 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. The suspension was applied onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverglass, and bacteria were allowed to attach for 30 min. The liquid was poured away, and the coverglass was mounted on a slide using Dako mounting media (Dako, Carpinteria, CA). The bacteria were visualized by using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu C4742-95 cooled closed circuit device camera, a Plan Apochromat (×100 objective), and a high numerical aperture oil condenser. Hemolysis Assay—EDTA-blood was centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min, and the plasma and buffy coat were removed. The erythrocytes were washed three times and resuspended in 5% PBS, pH 7.4. The cells were then incubated with end-over-end rotation for 1 h at 37°C in the presence of different concentrations of peptides (0, 3, 6, 30, 60 μm). 2% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) served as positive control. The samples were then centrifuged at 800 × g for 10 min. The absorbance of hemoglobin release was measured at λ 540 nm and is in the plot expressed as % of Triton X-100-induced hemolysis. Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) Assay—HaCaT keratinocytes were grown in 96-well plates (3000 cells/well) in DMEM/10% fecal calf serum to confluence. The medium was removed, and the cells were washed with 100 μl of DMEM. 100 μl of HKH20 and LL-37 (0, 3, 6, 30, 60 μm) diluted in DMEM were added in triplicates to different wells of the plate. The LDH-based TOX-7 kit (Sigma-Aldrich) was used for quantification of LDH release from the cells. For detailed laboratory procedures, see the instructions given by the manufacturer. MTT Assay—Sterile filtered MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) (Sigma-Aldrich) solution (5 mg/ml in PBS) was stored protected from light at -20 °C until use. HaCaT keratinocytes, 3000 cells/well, were seeded in 96-well plates and grown in DMEM/10% fetal calf serum to confluence. The medium was changed to DMEM (without fetal calf serum), and the HKH20 peptide was added in triplicates at different concentrations (0, 3, 6, 30, 60 μm). After overnight incubation, 20 μl of the MTT solution was added to each well, and the plates were incubated for 1 h in CO2 at 37 °C. The MTT-containing medium was then removed by aspiration. Each well was washed gently with 100 μl of PBS, and the blue formazan product generated was dissolved by the addition of 100 μl of 100% Me2SO per well. The plates were gently swirled for 10 min at room temperature to dissolve the precipitate. The absorbance was monitored at λ 550 nm. Proteolytic Generation of Peptides from HMWK—HMWK (16 μg) was incubated at 37 °C for 10 or 30 min with P. aeruginosa elastase (0.1 μg, 261 units/mg) or neutrophil elastase (0.4 μg, 29 units/mg) or freeze/thaw disrupted polymorphonuclear neutrophils (17.7 μl, 1 × 106 cells/ml) in a total volume of 30 μl. HMWK (16 μg) incubated at 37 °C for 30 min was used as control. Fifteen microliters of the material were analyzed on 16.5% precast SDS polyacrylamide Tris/Tricine gels (Bio-Rad) under reducing conditions (Fig. 6B). Proteins/peptides were also transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond™-C, Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked by 3% (w/v) skim milk, washed, incubated for 1 h with rabbit polyclonal HKH20 antibodies (1:5000) (Innovagen AB), washed again, and subsequently incubated (1 h) with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary swine anti-rabbit antibodies (1:1000) (Dako). HKH20 proteins/fragments containing whole or parts of the HKH20 sequence were visualized using the ECL developing system (Amersham Biosciences) (Fig. 6C). Definition of Kininogen Cleavage Product—Peptides generated by degradation of HMWK by P. aeruginosa elastase were transferred from a 16.5% Tris/Tricine gel onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Hybond™-P, Amersham Biosciences). One major peptide (indicated by an arrow in Fig. 6B) was cut out and sent for N-terminal sequencing (Protein Analysis Center, Karolinska Intitutet, Stockholm, Sweden). The sequence LDDDLE was obtained. The major detected MALDI signal (Protein Analysis Center, Karolinska) corresponded to the mass 4428.19 Da, thus identifying the peptide as LDD40 (Fig. 6D). Antimicrobial Effects of Recombinant Domain 5 and D5-derived Peptides from HMWK—To elucidate whether domain 5 of HMWK possesses antibacterial activity, we initially investigated the effects of purified recombinant domain 5 (rD5)on E. faecalis (Fig. 2A) and E. coli (Fig. 2C). The results showed that rD5 was found to be antibacterial against these bacteria. Notably, rD5 exerted inhibitory activity in RDA similar to the classical AMP LL-37 (Fig. 2C). To characterize functional antimicrobial epitopes of this domain of HMWK, we synthesized overlapping peptides (Fig. 1B) and tested them for antibacterial activities. The results showed that peptides derived from the histidine- and lysine-rich parts of D5 (His469-Lys502, represented by peptides GGH20, HKH20, and GKH17) exerted potent antibacterial activities in RDA against E. coli (Fig. 2B). The calculated pI values for these active peptides ranged between 9.70 and 10.78 (www.expasy.org/tools/pi_tool.html), and the net positive charge was +3 to +7, values comparable with those reported for many cationic AMPs. RDA analyses using P. aeruginosa and E. faecalis identified the HKH20 peptide as the most potent epitope of D5 (not shown). Furthermore, the HKH20 peptide exerted antimicrobial effects comparable with both intact rD5 and LL-37 (Fig. 2C). Likewise, molecular modeling of the rD5 sequence using the homologous protein hisactophilin from D. discoideum as a template suggested that the sequence His479-His498 exposes critical cationic lysine residues, which enable interaction of rD5 with negatively charged bacterial membranes. Thus, in the following experiments, we focused on this specific epitope of D5 (Fig. 1). In viable count assays, HKH20 exerted antibacterial effects against E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and E. faecalis (Fig. 2D). Using RDA, the MEC value of HKH20 against P. aeruginosa was estimated to be 0.4 μm, which was com"
https://openalex.org/W1969313046,"After decades of speculation, the existence of binary asteroids has been observationally confirmed, with examples in all minor planet populations. However, no triple systems have hitherto been discovered. Here we report the unambiguous detection of a triple asteroidal system in the main belt, composed of a 280-km primary (87 Sylvia) and two small moonlets orbiting at 710 and 1,360 km. We estimate their orbital elements and use them to refine the shape of the primary body. Both orbits are equatorial, circular and prograde, suggesting a common origin. Using the orbital information to estimate its mass and density, 87 Sylvia appears to have a rubble-pile structure with a porosity of 25-60 per cent. The system was most probably formed through the disruptive collision of a parent asteroid, with the new primary resulting from accretion of fragments, while the moonlets are formed from the debris, as has been predicted previously."
https://openalex.org/W2057976029,"Reccurent chromosomal translocation t(4;14) (p16.3;q32.3) occurs in patients with multiple myeloma (MM) and is associated with ectopic overexpression of fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) that sometimes may contain the activation mutations such as K650E thanatophoric dysplasia type II (TDII). Although there have been significant advances in therapy for MM including the use of proteasome inhibitors, t(4;14) MM has a particularly poor prognosis and most patients still die from complications related to their disease or therapy. One potential therapeutic strategy is to inhibit FGFR3 in those myeloma patients that overexpress the receptor tyrosine kinase due to chromosomal translocation. Here we evaluated PKC412, a small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, for treatment of FGFR3-induced hematopoietic malignancies. PKC412 inhibited kinase activation and proliferation of hematopoietic Ba/F3 cells transformed by FGFR3 TDII or a TEL-FGFR3 fusion. Similar results were obtained in PKC412 inhibition of several different t(4;14)-positive human MM cell lines. Furthermore, treatment with PKC412 resulted in a statistically significant prolongation of survival in murine bone marrow transplant models of FGFR3 TDII-induced pre-B cell lymphoma, or a peripheral T-cell lymphoma associated TEL-FGFR3 fusion-induced myeloproliferative disease. These data indicate that PKC412 may be a useful molecularly targeted therapy for MM associated with overexpression of FGFR3, and perhaps other diseases associated with dysregulation of FGFR3 or related mutants."

https://openalex.org/W2145363714,"Liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) is a nuclear receptor previously known to have distinct functions during mouse development and essential roles in cholesterol homeostasis. Recently, a new role for LRH-1 has been discovered in tumor progression, giving LRH-1 potential transforming functions. In order to identify critical factors stimulating LRH-1 expression leading to deregulated cellular proliferation, we studied its expression and its regulation in several breast cancer cell lines. We observed that LRH-1 expression was increased in estrogen receptor (ER) alpha expressing cell lines, whereas weak-to-no expression was found in nonexpressing ERalpha cell lines. In MCF7, LRH-1 expression was highly induced after treatment with 17beta-estradiol (E2). This transcriptional regulation was the result of a direct binding of the ER to the LRH-1 promoter, as demonstrated by gelshift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Interestingly, siRNA-mediated inactivation of LRH-1 decreased the E2-dependent proliferation of MCF7 cells. Finally, LRH-1 protein expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in tumor cells of human mammary ductal carcinomas. Altogether, these data demonstrate that LRH-1 is transcriptionally regulated by the ER alpha and reinforce the hypothesis that LRH-1 could exert potential oncogenic effects during breast cancer formation."
https://openalex.org/W1975091600,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is an environmental carcinogen-activated transcription factor associated with tumorigenesis. High levels of apparently active AhR characterize a variety of tumors, even in the absence of environmental ligands. Despite this association between transformation and AhR upregulation, little is known of the transcriptional consequences of constitutive AhR activation. Here, the effects of constitutively active and environmental ligand-induced AhR on c-myc, an oncogene whose promoter contains six AhR-binding sites (AhREs (aryl hydrocarbon response elements)), were investigated. A reporter containing the human c-myc promoter, with its six AhREs and two NF-kappaB-binding sites, was constructed. This vector, and variants with deletions in the NF-kappaB and/or AhR-binding sites, was transfected into a human breast cancer cell line, Hs578T, which expresses high levels of apparently active, nuclear AhR. Results indicate that: (1) the AhR constitutively binds the c-myc promoter; (2) there is a low but significant baseline level of c-myc promoter activity, which is not regulated by NF-kappaB and is not affected by an environmental AhR ligand; (3) deletion of any one of the AhREs has no effect on constitutive reporter activity, while deletion of all six increases reporter activity approximately fivefold; (4) a similar increase in reporter activity occurs when constitutively active AhR is suppressed by transfection with an AhR repressor plasmid (AhRR); (5) AhRR transfection significantly increases background levels of endogenous c-myc mRNA and c-Myc protein. These results suggest that the AhR influences the expression of c-Myc, a protein critical to malignant transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2168159948,"1-(2-Chlorophenyl-N-methylpropyl)-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide (PK11195) is a prototypic ligand of the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), a mitochondrial outer membrane protein. PK11195 can be used to chemosensitize tumor cells to a variety of chemotherapeutic agents, both in vitro and in vivo. PK11195 has been suggested to exert this effect via inhibition of the multiple drug resistance (MDR) pump and by direct mitochondrial effects which could be mediated by the PBR. Here, we established a model system in which PK11195 and another PBR ligand, 7-chloro-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,3-dihydro-1-methyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one (Ro5-4864), sensitize to nutrient depletion-induced cell death. In this MDR-independent model, PK11195 and Ro5-4864 are fully active even when the PBR is knocked down by small interfering RNA. Cells that lack PBR possess low-affinity binding sites for PK11195 and Ro5-4864. The starvation-sensitizing effects of PK11195 are not due to a modulation of the adaptive response of starved cells, namely autophagy and NF-kappaB activation. Rather, it appears that the combination of PK11195 with autophagy or NF-kappaB inhibitors has a potent synergistic death-inducing effect. Starved cells treated with PK11195 exhibit characteristics of apoptosis, including loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, mitochondrial cytochrome c release, caspase activation and chromatin condensation. Accordingly, stabilization of mitochondria by overexpression of Bcl-2 or expression of the viral mitochondrial inhibitor (vMIA) from cytomegalovirus inhibits cell death induced by PK11195 plus starvation. Thus, PK11195 potently sensitizes to apoptosis via a pathway that involves mitochondria, yet does not involve the PBR."

Studies using heparanase inhibitors and gene silencing have provided evidence to support an important role for heparanase in tumor metastasis and angiogenesis. The expression of heparanase is normally very tightly controlled, however, it is commonly deregulated in tumor cells, which express elevated heparanase activity that correlates with high levels of heparanase mRNA. We recently identified the transcription factor early growth response gene 1, EGR1, as a key regulator of inducible heparanase transcription in T cells. In this study using chromatin immunoprecipitation, we demonstrate for the first time that EGR1 binds to the heparanase gene promoter in vivo. The important question of the role of EGR1 in regulating heparanase transcription in tumor cells was then assessed. Studies were carried out in four epithelial tumor lines of different tissue origin. Functional dissection of the heparanase promoter identified a 280-bp region that was critical for transcription of the heparanase gene. Transactivation studies using an EGR1 expression vector co-transfected with a reporter construct containing the 280-bp region showed EGR1-activated heparanase promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner in prostate or breast adenocarcinoma and colon carcinoma cell lines. In contrast, overexpression of EGR1 resulted in a dose-dependent repression of promoter activity in melanoma cells. Using site-directed mutagenesis the 280-bp region was found to contain two functional EGR1 sites and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed binding of EGR1 to both of these sites upon activation of tumor cells. Furthermore, the heparanase promoter region containing the EGR1 sites was also inducible in tumor cells and induction corresponded to HPSE expression levels. These studies show that EGR1 regulates heparanase transcription in tumor cells and importantly, can have a repressive or activating role depending on the tumor type.

An essential structural component of the ECM and also cell surfaces are heparan sulfate proteoglycans.

We recently reported the identification of the serum inducible zinc finger transcription factor human early growth response gene 1 (EGR1) (41Gashler A. Sukhatme V.P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

These current studies address the important question as to whether EGR1 may also be playing a key role in the deregulated expression of HPSE in human tumor cells. EGR1 is a member of the early growth response family that also includes, EGR2, EGR3, EGR4, and WT-1. This family of transcription factors share the ability to bind to GC-rich recognition motifs in DNA (41Gashler A. Sukhatme V.P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol.

EGR1 is a nuclear phospho-protein that is rapidly induced in response to a variety of extracellular and environmental signals (including growth factors, cytokines, vascular injury, and hypoxia) (41Gashler A.

The well characterized neo-vascularization promoting function of EGR1 in tissue injury suggests it would play an important role in tumor growth and tumor angiogenesis. Indeed, studies using knockdown strategies have confirmed a central in vivo role for EGR1 in tumor angiogenesis, growth, and metastasis in breast adenocarcinoma (47Fahmy R.G. Dass C.R. Sun L.Q.

A recent study of human prostate cancer samples has shown a correlation between EGR1 expression and HPSE mRNA expression (39Ogishima T. Shiina H. Breault J.E. Tabatabai L. Bassett W.W. Enokida H. Li L.C. Kawakami T. Urakami S. Ribeiro-Filho L.A. Terashima M. Fujime M. Igawa M. Dahiya R. Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 1028-1036PubMed Google Scholar), further supporting a role for EGR1 in regulating HPSE transcription in tumor cells. In this article we have functionally dissected the human HPSE promoter and identified EGR1 as critical in binding to two elements in the HPSE promoter and regulating transcription in tumor cells. Interestingly, EGR1 was found to have differential regulatory effects on HPSE transcription depending on the tumor type. These findings represent an important advance into understanding the mechanisms that control transcription of the HPSE gene in tumor cells. Cell Culture, Transfections, and Luciferase Assays—MCF7 human breast carcinoma cells were from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA), PC-3 human prostate adenocarcinoma cells (ATCC) MM170 human melanoma cells, COLO397 human colon carcinoma cells, and B16-F1 mouse melanoma cells were cultured in RPMI medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 37 °C. Transient transfections of MCF7, PC-3, COLO397, and B16-F10 cells were performed using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly for the luciferase reporter experiments, cells at 70–80% confluence were transfected with luciferase reporter constructs and a Renilla luciferase construct, pRLTK (Promega), as an internal control. Transient transfection of MM170 melanoma cells were performed using Bio-Rad Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad) at 270 volts and 975 capacitance with 5 μg of reporter construct and 1 μg of pRLTK being transfected per 4–5 × 106 cells. For the EGR1 overexpression experiments, each of the tumor cell lines were transfected as described above, with a constant amount of total DNA used, i.e. when decreasing amounts of pCR3.1-EGR-1 or pCB6-Egr1 were transfected, the balance was made up by co-transfection with the backbone constructs, pCR3.1 or pCB6+. Each of the tumor cell lines were transfected at similar efficiencies. After transfection, cells were rested for 24 h and then assayed for luciferase activity using a Dual-Glo™ luciferase assay system (Promega). Plates were read on a Reporter Microplate Luminometer (Turner Biosystems, Sunnyvale, CA). In activation assays, cells were rested for 24 h and then stimulated with 50 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Sigma) for 16 h then assayed for luciferase activity as described above. Overexpression studies and mutagenesis effects were analyzed for statistical significance by using a two-tailed Student's t test. Plasmid Constructs—Luciferase reporter constructs pXP-1/1300bp, pXP-1/520bp, pXP-1/280bp, pXP-1/120bp, pXP-1/280bpMUT, and pCB6-Egr1 have been previously described (42de Mestre A.M. Khachigian L.M.

The pXP-1/280bpMUT2 construct was generated by splice overlap extension PCR by mutating the core sequence of the second putative EGR1 binding site, TGGG, to GTTT using the pXP-1/280bp construct as a template. Briefly two PCR were performed to generate overlapping 5′ and 3′ fragments encoding each mutation, which were then spliced together in a third PCR. The oligonucleotide primers used to generate these fragments were MTWT-1 and HHP1 or MTWT-2 and HHP3. The sequences of oligonucleotide primers MTWT-1, MTWT-2, HHP1, and HHP3 were 5′-AAGAGGAGGTTTAGGGATGGAGGGC-3′, 5′-TCCATCCCTAAACCTCCTCTTCTG-3′, 5′-TTCGAGCGCAGCAGCATC-3′ and 5′-GTAAGTGAACGTGACC-3, respectively. A 478-bp fragment of the mouse HPSE gene promoter was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA isolated from C57BL/6 mice, using oligonucleotide primers, MHP1 and MHP6. The amplified fragment was cloned into the BglII/KpnI site in pXP-1, to generate the vector pXP-1/0.5kb. The sequences of MHP1 and MHP6 were 5′-CAGCATCCCACCTGGCTG-3′ and 5′-TAAGGCAGAAGGGAGTC-3′, respectively. The pXP-1/0.5kbMUT1 construct was generated using the QuikChange® 11 XL Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) as described by the manufacturer, using pXP-1/0.5kb as a template. The core binding motif (underlined) of the putative Egr1 site, AGGGGTGGGAGG, was mutated to TGTT. The sequences of the oligonucleotide primers used to generate this mutation were: MEGRM1F, 5′-GGACTCCCGGGAGGGTGTTGAGGGATGGAGCGCTG-3′ and MEGRM1R, 5′-CAGCGCTCCATCCCTCAACACCCTCCCGGGAGTCC-3′. The EGR-1 expression vector, pCR3.1-EGR1, was generated using PCR to amplify a 1859-bp cDNA encoding for human EGR1 with oligonucleotides: HEGR1A, 5′-TGTCCCCTGCAGCTCCAGC-3′ and HEGR1B, 5′-ATAGACCTTCCACTCCAGTAG-3′. This fragment was cloned into pCR3.1 (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer's instructions. The nucleotide sequence integrity of all clones was confirmed by automated sequencing (Biomolecular Resource Facility, The John Curtin School of Medical Research, Canberra, Australia) using an ABI 3730 Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) following the manufacturer's protocol. RNA Extraction and Real Time Quantitative RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted from tumor cells at 80% confluence, using TriReagent® (Molecular Research Center Inc., Cincinnati, OH) as described by the manufacturer. cDNA synthesis was performed on 1 μg of total RNA using Superscript™ 111 Reverse Transcriptase as per the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). SYBR Green (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) real time PCR for amplification of heparanase, EGR1, or the housekeeper gene ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, E2D 2, were performed using a ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detector (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as previously described (42de Mestre A.M.

A dissociation curve was performed after each experiment to confirm a single product was amplified. A standard curve was generated for each gene using known copy numbers of a plasmid containing the cDNA specific to the gene. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—ChIP analysis was performed on 5 × 106 Jurkat T cells either non-stimulated or following stimulation with PMA (20 ng/ml) and calcium ionophore (Sigma) (1 μm) for 4 or 12 h following a protocol previously described with some modifications (54Litt M.D. Simpson M.

In brief, cells were harvested and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 10 min, and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 0.25 m glycine. Cells were washed four times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in ChIP SDS lysis buffer (Upstate Biotechnology, Charlottesville, VA) in the presence of Complete protease inhibitors (Roche Diagnostics), and sonicated to shear chromatin using a Cole Palmer Ultrasonic processor (Cole Palmer, Vernon Hills, IL). The sonicated DNA fragments were in the range of 100 to 1000 bp. The samples were pre-cleared with 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA-protein A-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology) and subsequently incubated with either 4 μg of anti-EGR1 antibody Egr1X-588 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or without antibody as a control, overnight with rotation at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes were recovered with salmon sperm DNA-protein A-agarose (Upstate Biotechnology), washed extensively as described previously (55Chen X. Wang J. Woltring D. Gerondakis S. Shannon M.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 3209-3219Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), and eluted with ChIP elution buffer (Upstate Biotechnology). Following the reversal of cross-links at 65 °C overnight, samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform and resuspended in Milli Q water for real time PCR analysis. ChIP-purified DNA was screened for HPSE and CD69 proximal promoter fragments or –1-kb HPSE promoter fragments by real time PCR analysis as described previously (54Litt M.D. Simpson M.

The sequence for the oligonucleotide primers were: HPSE set A (proximal HPSE promoter) sense, 5′-TTCGTAAGTGAACGTCACCG-3′ and antisense, 5′-CTTCTGCATCCCTCCCACT-3′; HPSE set B (–1 kb HPSE promoter) sense, 5′-TTCTGACACTTCACATCCCG-3′ and antisense, 5′-AACCTGCCAAGTGCATACT-3′; and CD69 (proximal CD69 promoter) sense, 5′-AATCCCACTTTCCTCCTGCT-3′ and antisense, 5′-GCCGCCTACTTGCTTGACTA-3′ The amount of precipitated target sequence was calculated by normalization with the total input DNA after subtraction of the no antibody background as described previously (54Litt M.D. Simpson M.

Nuclear Extraction and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—PC-3 or MCF7 cells at 80% confluence were harvested and washed in 10 ml of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline either non-stimulated or after activation with PMA for 1.5 h.

https://openalex.org/W1963603983,"Apolipoprotein A-I (apoAI), the major protein of high density lipoprotein, plays an important role in reverse cholesterol transport via its activity as an ABCA1-dependent acceptor of cellular cholesterol. We reported recently that myeloperoxidase (MPO) modification of apoAI inhibits its ABCA1-dependent cholesterol acceptor activity (Zheng, L., Nukuna, B., Brennan, M. L., Sun, M., Goormastic, M., Settle, M., Schmitt, D., Fu, X., Thomson, L., Fox, P. L., Ischiropoulos, H., Smith, J. D., Kinter, M., and Hazen, S. L. (2004) J. Clin. Invest. 114, 529–541). We also reported that MPO-mediated chlorination preferentially modifies two of the seven tyrosines in apoAI, and loss of parent peptides containing these residues dose-dependently correlates with loss in ABCA1-mediated cholesterol acceptor activity (Zheng, L., Settle, M., Brubaker, G., Schmitt, D., Hazen, S. L., Smith, J. D., and Kinter, M. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 38–47). To determine whether oxidative modification of apoA-I tyrosine residues was responsible for the MPO-mediated inactivation of cholesterol acceptor activity, we made recombinant apoAI with site-specific substitutions of all seven tyrosine residues to phenylalanine. ApoAI and the tyrosine-free apoAI were equally susceptible to dose-dependent MPO-mediated loss of ABCA1-dependent cholesterol acceptor activity, as well as lipid binding activity. MPO modification altered the migration of apoAI on SDS gels and decreased its α-helix content. MPO-induced modification also targeted apoAI tryptophan and lysine residues. Specifically, we detected apoAI tryptophan oxidation to mono- and dihydroxytryptophan and apoAI lysine modification to chlorolysine and 2-aminoadipic acid. Thus, tyrosine modification of apoAI is not required for its MPO-mediated inhibition of cholesterol acceptor activity. Apolipoprotein A-I (apoAI), the major protein of high density lipoprotein, plays an important role in reverse cholesterol transport via its activity as an ABCA1-dependent acceptor of cellular cholesterol. We reported recently that myeloperoxidase (MPO) modification of apoAI inhibits its ABCA1-dependent cholesterol acceptor activity (Zheng, L., Nukuna, B., Brennan, M. L., Sun, M., Goormastic, M., Settle, M., Schmitt, D., Fu, X., Thomson, L., Fox, P. L., Ischiropoulos, H., Smith, J. D., Kinter, M., and Hazen, S. L. (2004) J. Clin. Invest. 114, 529–541). We also reported that MPO-mediated chlorination preferentially modifies two of the seven tyrosines in apoAI, and loss of parent peptides containing these residues dose-dependently correlates with loss in ABCA1-mediated cholesterol acceptor activity (Zheng, L., Settle, M., Brubaker, G., Schmitt, D., Hazen, S. L., Smith, J. D., and Kinter, M. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 38–47). To determine whether oxidative modification of apoA-I tyrosine residues was responsible for the MPO-mediated inactivation of cholesterol acceptor activity, we made recombinant apoAI with site-specific substitutions of all seven tyrosine residues to phenylalanine. ApoAI and the tyrosine-free apoAI were equally susceptible to dose-dependent MPO-mediated loss of ABCA1-dependent cholesterol acceptor activity, as well as lipid binding activity. MPO modification altered the migration of apoAI on SDS gels and decreased its α-helix content. MPO-induced modification also targeted apoAI tryptophan and lysine residues. Specifically, we detected apoAI tryptophan oxidation to mono- and dihydroxytryptophan and apoAI lysine modification to chlorolysine and 2-aminoadipic acid. Thus, tyrosine modification of apoAI is not required for its MPO-mediated inhibition of cholesterol acceptor activity.

Their protective effects may be mediated by several activities, including their ability to remove excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues for delivery to the liver via the reverse cholesterol transport pathway. Cellular lipid efflux to apoAI, as well as HDL biogenesis, is mediated by the transporter ABCA1, which is defective in Tangier disease (2Brooks-Wilson A. Marcil M. Clee S.M. Zhang L.H.

Although apoAI may have additional anti-atherogenic properties, recent studies in the mouse have proved that apoAI can stimulate the removal of the pre-loaded cholesterol from macrophages and the appearance of this cholesterol in the feces (6Zhang Y. Zanotti I. Reilly M.P. Glick J.M. Rothblat G.H. Rader D.J. Circulation. 2003; 108: 661-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). ApoAI is a 243-residue polypeptide containing an N-terminal domain followed by ten 11- or 22-residue amphipathic α-helical domains (7Brouillette C.G. Anantharamaiah G.M. Engler J.A. Borhani D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1531: 4-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). ApoAI adopts two distinct physiological conformations, lipid-free and lipid-bound. In the absence of lipid, apoAI is thought to exist as a helical bundle or hairpin that is stabilized by hydrophobic helix-helix interactions (8Rogers D.P. Roberts L.M. Lebowitz J. Engler J.A.

These helical bundles undergo a conformational change during lipid association that results in the substitution of helix-helix interactions for helix-lipid interactions (13Saito H. Dhanasekaran P.

Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is a neutrophil and monocyte/macrophage enzyme that utilizes hydrogen peroxide and chloride to generate the chlorinating oxidant HOCl to kill pathogens (14Hazen S.L. Hsu F.F. Mueller D.M. Crowley J.R. Heinecke J.W. J. Clin. Investig. 1996; 98: 1283-1289Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). MPO can also utilize hydrogen peroxide and nitrite to generate nitrating oxidants capable of initiating lipid peroxidation and protein nitration (15Hazen S.L. Zhang R. Shen Z. Wu W. Podrez E.A.

We recently described that plasma and atherosclerotic lesion-derived apoAI are selective targets for MPO modification resulting in the appearance of specific nitro- and chlorotyrosine residues, and that this modification dose-dependently decreased the cholesterol acceptor and lipid binding activities of apoAI (22Zheng L. Nukuna B. Brennan M.L. Sun M. Goormastic M. Settle M. Schmitt D. Fu X. Thomson L. Fox P.L. Ischiropoulos H. Smith J.D. Kinter M. Hazen S.L. J. Clin.

Mass spectroscopy was used to map the sites of MPO-mediated apoAI nitration and chlorination in vitro and on apoAI isolated from human atheroma. After in vitro modification, we could detect MPO-mediated chlorination of four out of the seven tyrosines, in order of preference at position 192 > 166 ≫ 29–236 (23Zheng L. Settle M. Brubaker G. Schmitt D. Hazen S.L. Smith J.D. Kinter M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The preference for tyrosine 192 modification by MPO and the loss of cholesterol acceptor activity of apoAI by MPO-mediated chlorination were independently confirmed (24Shao B. Bergt C. Fu X. Green P.

Although apoAI tyrosine chlorination was associated with the MPO-mediated loss of the cholesterol acceptor activity of apoAI, tyrosine chlorination might only serve as a molecular fingerprint for apoAI modification by MPO, and not the cause of apolipoprotein loss of cholesterol efflux function, as other changes in apoAI have been found after oxidative modification (25Garner B.

To address the specific role of tyrosine modification in MPO-dependent inactivation of apoAI, we used site-directed mutagenesis to create a tyrosine-free recombinant human apoAI. We found that exposure to the MPO/H2O2/Cl– system inhibited ABCA1-dependent cholesterol acceptor activity to an equal extent in the tyrosine-containing and tyrosine-free apoAI acceptors. MPO-mediated modification decreased the α-helix content of apoAI, a physical feature related to lipid binding activity of apoAI (13Saito H. Dhanasekaran P. Nguyen D. Deridder E. Holvoet P. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20974-20981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). ApoAI tryptophan fluorescence and lysine content were decreased by MPO modification in an H2O2 dose-dependent manner. Tryptophan and lysine oxidation were confirmed by mass spectrometry. Thus, modification of residues other than tyrosine are responsible for MPO-induced loss of the cholesterol acceptor activity of apoAI. Generation and Isolation of Recombinant Human ApoAI and ApoAI Mutants—cDNA encoding His6-tagged recombinant human apoAI (rh-apoAI) in the pET-20b bacterial expression vector was gift from Dr. Oda (see Ref. 31Ryan R.O. Forte T.M. Oda M.N. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 27: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Point mutations of tyrosine to phenylalanine in rh-apoA-I cDNA at positions 18, 29, 100, 115, 166, 192, and 236 (rh7YF-apoAI) were made by using Quick-Change mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All the mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmids were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE-3) pLysS, and apoAI expression was induced with 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside by overnight incubation at room temperature. The cell pellet was dissolved in B-PER lysis buffer (Pierce) followed by centrifugation to sediment cell debris. The supernatant was diluted into phosphate-buffered saline containing 3 m guanidine HCl, pH 7.0, loaded onto a nickel-chelating histidine-binding resin column, and then specifically eluted with imidazole as described previously (31Ryan R.O. Forte T.M. Oda M.N. Protein Expression Purif. 2003; 27: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Recombinant apoAI was dialyzed extensively in 60 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 μm diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid. ApoAI samples were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. The gels were either stained for protein with 0.25% Coomassie Blue or transferred to a PVDF membrane and probed with goat anti-human apoA1 (1:1000, Diasorin, Saco, ME) in the presence of casein blocker (Pierce). Detection was performed with a rabbit anti-goat antibody linked to horseradish peroxidase (1:10,000) followed by enhanced chemiluminescence. MPO Modification of ApoAI—The MPO-mediated modification reactions were carried out with 3.5–7 μm apoAI in 60 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 100 μm diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid, 57 nm purified human MPO, prepared as described previously (22Zheng L. Nukuna B. Brennan M.L. Sun M. Goormastic M. Settle M. Schmitt D. Fu X. Thomson L. Fox P.L. Ischiropoulos H. Smith J.D. Kinter M. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar), and 100 mm sodium chloride. The MPO reactions were initiated by adding hydrogen peroxide at varying concentrations (0–150 μm) in 4 aliquots at 15-min intervals at 37 °C and continuing incubation for a total of 90 min. When indicated, 2 mm l-methionine was added to quench the generated HOCl. These reaction conditions include concentrations of MPO, chloride, and hydrogen peroxide that range from physiologic to pathologic. The modified protein was stored at –20 °C, unless indicated otherwise. Determination of Cholesterol Acceptor Activity—Cholesterol efflux experiments were performed according to established procedures (32Smith J.D. Le Goff W. Settle M. Brubaker G. Waelde C. Horwitz A. Oda M.N. J. Lipid Res. 2004; 45: 635-644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Briefly, RAW264.7 cells in 24-well dishes were cholesterol-loaded and labeled overnight in 0.5 ml of DGGB (DMEM supplemented with 50 mm glucose, 2 mm glutamine, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin), containing [3H]cholesterol-labeled acetylated low density lipoprotein. The day after labeling, the cells were washed three times in DMEM containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin and incubated with 0.5 ml of DMEM with or without 0.3 mm 8-Br-cAMP for 16 h. The following day, 5 μg/ml apoAI in 0.5 ml of DMEM with or without 8-Br-cAMP was added to each well. After a 4-h incubation at 37 °C, the medium was removed and centrifuged, and 100 μl of medium was counted for radioactivity as a measure of the cholesterol released into the media. The respective cells from each well were extracted with hexane/isopropyl alcohol (3:2, v/v), and the radioactivity was determined as a measure of the cholesterol retained in the cell. The percent cholesterol efflux was calculated as the radioactivity in the medium divided by the total radioactivity (medium radioactivity plus cell radioactivity). ApoAI Lipid Binding Activity—An LDL aggregation assay was used to test apoAI lipid binding as described (23Zheng L. Settle M. Brubaker G. Schmitt D. Hazen S.L. Smith J.D. Kinter M. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 38-47Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Briefly, in a 96-well assay plate, 75 μg of LDL was mixed with or without 3 μg of native or modified apoAI in a final volume of 200 μl of reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, with 150 mm NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2). The plate was incubated in an absorbance plate reader at 37 °C for 10 min. A 20-μl aliquot of diluted phospholipase C, derived from Bacillus cereus (Sigma catalog number P7147), sufficient to induce LDL aggregation in 1 h, or a buffer control, was added to each well to hydrolyze the phospholipid polar head groups to make the LDL surface hydrophobic and to initiate aggregation. Aggregation at 37 °C was monitored by absorbance at 478 nm, read every 2 min for a period of 1 h. ApoAI lipid binding activity resulted in the inhibition of the LDL aggregation and was calculated from the aggregation rate (ΔOD/Δmin) during the rapid linear phase of aggregation that occurred after a short time lag. The lipid binding activity for the modified apoAI was normalized to the activity of unmodified apoAI. Spectral Studies of ApoAI—Far-UV circular dichroism spectra were recorded on a Pistar180 spectropolarimeter (Applied Photophysics, Surrey, UK). Standardization was performed with an aqueous solution of 0.06% ammonium d-(+)-10-camphor sulfonate at a wavelengths of 260 to 200 nm and with a path length of 10 mm. Unmodified and modified apoAI samples were analyzed at ambient temperature in continuous scan mode with a 1-nm bandwidth (100000 counts/step). The spectra were normalized to mean residue ellipticity with the use of a mean residue molecular mass of 115.2 Da for apoAI. Fractional α-helix contents were calculated using the neural network-based K2d program (33Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (947) Google Scholar) or by use of the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm as described previously (34Chen Y.H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1959) Google Scholar). Tryptophan fluorescence spectra were obtained using apoAI diluted to 25 μg/ml in 60 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl. Tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra from 300 to 450 nm were collected at 25 °C with an excitation at 295 nm to avoid tyrosine fluorescence. The wavelength of maximum fluorescence (WMF) and the fluorescence area under the curve were determined from the spectra after subtraction of the buffer base-line spectrum. ApoAI Mass Spectrometry Analysis—Intact protein mass of unmodified and modified apoAI were determined by LC ESI-MS analysis with an LCQ Deca MS (Thermo, CA) equipped with a ultra plus II HPLC system (Micro-tech Scientific, Vista, CA) and a Vydac C4 column (5 μm, 300 Å, 1 mm × 5 cm). For these analyses, aqueous trifluoroacetic acid/acetonitrile solvents were used with a gradient of 30–70% acetonitrile over 20 min and a flow rate of 30 μl/min. The deconvolution of mass spectra of intact proteins was performed using Magtran software. For protein sequence data, apoAI gel bands were digested in situ with the protease Glu-C (Promega, Madison, WI) or trypsin, as described previously (22Zheng L. Nukuna B. Brennan M.L. Sun M. Goormastic M. Settle M. Schmitt D. Fu X. Thomson L. Fox P.L. Ischiropoulos H. Smith J.D. Kinter M. Hazen S.L. J. Clin. Investig. 2004; 114: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (645) Google Scholar). The peptides were extracted from the gel, evaporated to dryness, and reconstituted in either 1% acetic acid or 0.1% formic acid for analysis by capillary column HPLC-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The detection of the oxidation sites was carried out using an LCQ Deca ion trap mass spectrometer system (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) equipped with a nanospray ionization source (Protana, Odense, Denmark). The source was operated under microspray conditions at a flow rate of 200 nl/min. The Glu-C-digested apoAI was analyzed by reversed phase capillary HPLC using a 50-μm inner diameter. column with a 15-μm inner diameter tip (New Objective Corp., Woburn, MA). The column was packed with ∼6 cm of C18 packing material (Phenomenex, Torrence, CA) and eluted using a 45-min acetonitrile gradient (2–70%) in 50 mm acetic acid. The data were acquired in the data-dependent mode, recording a mass spectrum and three collision-induced dissociation (CID) spectra in repetitive cycles. The program Sequest was used to compare all CID spectra recorded to the sequence of protein and considering the appropriate mass changes in the residues (35Ducret A. Van Oostveen I. Eng J.K. Yates III, J.R. Aebersold R. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 706-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Analysis of ApoAI Lysine Modification—ApoAI lysines were assayed using the sensitive fluorogenic o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) reagent (36Goodno C.C. Swaisgood H.E. Catignani G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 115: 203-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Two-μg aliquots of apoAI or MPO-modified apoAI were mixed with 250 μl of complete OPA reagent (Sigma, catalog number P0532) and incubated for 5 min in 96-well plates with moderate shaking at room temperature. The fluorescence was determined in a fluorescence plate reader with excitation of 360 nm and emission of 460 nm. Fluorescence was corrected by subtraction of the MPO reaction buffer blank. All values are given relative to the unmodified apoAI sample. Control reactions in 3 m guanidine or 1% SDS revealed that >99% of apoAI lysine residues was accessible to the OPA reagent in aqueous buffer. In an attempt to reverse the MPO-mediated apoAI lysine modification (H2O2/apoAI = 7.1:1), MPO/H2O2/Cl–-modified apoAI (7 μm) was treated with NaBH4 (on ice) or NaI (at room temperature), and both were performed with 350 μm final concentration with stock reagents added in three intervals over a 30-min period. Acetic acid treatment of 7 μm MPO-modified apoAI was performed at room temperature at a 1 m HAc final concentration, with stock reagent added in three intervals over a 30-min period. Methionine treatment of 7 μm MPO-modified apoAI was performed by adding methionine to a final concentration of 350 μm at 37 °C for 30 min. All of the samples were then dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, at 4 °C. Chloramine formation following MPO modification was quantified using 5-thio-2-nitrobenzoic acid (TNB) as described by Firuzi et al. (37Firuzi O. Giansanti L. Vento R. Seibert C. Petrucci R. Marrosu G. Agostino R. Saso L. J. Pharm. Pharmacol. 2003; 55: 1021-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, after MPO-mediated modification of apoAI, Trolox was added to 0.4 mm to remove excess HOCl. Five minutes later, TNB was added to 75 μm, and the samples were incubated for 5 min. The absorbance of the samples was measured at 412 nm. The decrease of absorbance at 412 nm reflects the formation of chloramines, and the concentration of chloramines formed was calculated using an NaOCl standard. Protein carbonyls were detected by Western blot using OxyBlot protein oxidation detection kit (Chemicon). The unmodified and modified apoAI were reacted with DNPH for 15 min followed by separation on 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel under reducing conditions. Protein was transferred to a PVDF membrane and probed with rabbit anti-2,4-dinitrophenol antibody. Detection was performed by enhanced chemiluminescence. Lysine and 2-aminoadipic acid in oxidized apoAI were quantified by stable isotope dilution LC MS/MS on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Ionics, Concord, Canada) interfaced with an Aria LX Series HPLC multiplexing system (Cohesive Technologies Inc., Franklin, MA). After hydrolysis in 6 n HCl under argon atmosphere for 24 h, samples were passed through a cation exchange solid-phase extraction column (Discovery DSC-SCX minicolumn; 1 ml; Supelco, Bellefone, PA) and washed with 0.8% formic acid. Lysine and 2-aminoadipic acid were then eluted with 5% NH3 solution containing 70% methanol. After drying under vacuum and resuspension in 0.2% formic acid, samples were injected and separated on a Rexchrom phenyl column (5 μm, 100 Å, 4.6 mm × 25 cm, Bodman Industries, Aston, PA) at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Mass spectrometric analyses were performed using electrospray ionization in positive ion mode with multiple reaction monitoring of precursor and characteristic fragment ions of lysine and 2-aminoadipic acid. The stable isotope [13C6,15N2]lysine was used as the internal standard. The transitions monitored were 162.4 to 98.1, 162.4 to 144.1, and 162.4 to 116 for 2-aminoadipic acid, 147.1 to 84.1 for lysine, and 155.1 to 90.1 for the stable isotope [13C6,15N2]lysine. Analysis of ApoAI Net Charge—Isoelectric focusing (IEF) was performed to determine the isoelectric point (pI) of apoAI and modified apoAI. IEF was performed using precast pH 3–7 gels and IEF buffers (Invitrogen). The pH values on the gel were calibrated using an IEF standard protein marker (Invitrogen) and Coomassie staining. After electrophoresis at 100 V for 1 h, 200 V for 1 h, and 500 V for 30 min, the protein was transferred to a PVDF membrane for Western blot using a goat anti-human apoAI antibody, as described above. Statistical Analyses—All data are presented as the mean ± S.D. of triplicate determinations, unless stated otherwise. Statistical comparison of three or more groups was performed by using analysis of variance and the Newman-Keuls multiple comparison post-test. Tyrosine-free ApoAI Is Susceptible to MPO-induced Loss of Function—We prepared recombinant human His-tagged wild type apoA-I (rh-apoAI) and a mutant form in which all seven tyrosine residues were substituted with phenylalanine residues (rh7YF-apoAI), as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Both of the recombinant apoAI proteins migrated on reducing SDS-PAGE slightly larger (∼29 kDa) than plasma-derived apoAI (∼28 kDa) because of the N-terminal His6 tag (Fig. 1A). Coomassie Blue staining of the recombinant apoAI proteins revealed that they were at least 95% pure (Fig. 1A). To determine whether the His tag affected the lipid acceptor activity of the recombinant apoAI proteins, we compared their ABCA1-dependent and -independent cholesterol acceptor activity with plasma-derived apoAI (Biodesign International, Saco, ME) using the RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cell line in which ABCA1 expression is inducible by cAMP analogues (38Smith J.D.

https://openalex.org/W2035614544,"We have performed an in vitro selection for an anti-apoptotic phenotype that resembles the selection process that pre-malignant cells undergo in the initial phase of carcinogenesis in vivo. Using the cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa S3 as a model system, the selection procedure yielded cell clones that displayed increased resistance to apoptosis induced by Fas, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, and serum starvation. Gene expression profiling using gene family focused cDNA arrays revealed numerous genes that are differentially expressed in HeLa S3 and the resistant subclones and therefore are potentially involved in the definition of sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli. From the genes identified in this functional genomics approach we validated the anti-apoptotic activity of the membrane-anchored matrix metalloproteinase 15 (MMP-15) by means of small interfering RNA-mediated knock-down and ectopic expression in parental HeLa S3 cells and, to confirm a more general significance of our findings, in other cancer cell lines. The in vivo relevance of these findings is supported by the overexpression of MMP-15 in human lung adenocarcinoma compared with normal lung. Because MMP-15 is known to promote invasion, our results suggest that this protease connects metastasis and apoptosis resistance by an unknown regulatory mechanism. Our findings therefore strongly suggest that cancer characteristics such as metastatic potential, which are thought to evolve late in cancer progression, could be manifested early on by selection for an anti-apoptotic phenotype.

Our findings therefore strongly suggest that cancer characteristics such as metastatic potential, which are thought to evolve late in cancer progression, could be manifested early on by selection for an anti-apoptotic phenotype. The inhibition of apoptosis has been generally recognized as a major hallmark of cancer (1Hanahan D. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2000; 100: 57-70Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22275) Google Scholar). Oncogenic activation of proto-oncogenes by gene amplification or mutation normally induces apoptosis in the affected cells. Hence, apoptosis serves as a safeguard against cellular transformation. To allow for oncogenesis to occur, apoptosis has to be suppressed concomitantly with the activation of oncogenes and several apoptotic stimuli have to be bypassed later on in tumor evolution. These stimuli include attacks of the immune system, lack of growth factors, or detachment from the basal membrane. Finally, a number of chemotherapeutic agents such as doxorubicin and taxol act through inducing apoptosis in tumor cells (2Evan G.I. Vousden K.H. Nature. 2001; 411: 342-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (2695) Google Scholar). One mechanism by which immune cells kill their target tumor cells is by engagement of the death receptor system. Death receptors belong to a superfamily of plasma membrane-spanning receptors whose founding member is the tumor necrosis factor receptor. They form a subgroup that contains an intracellular death domain through which they can induce apoptosis. Binding to their cognate ligands leads to oligomerization of receptors, which in turn results in binding of the adaptor protein FADD 3The abbreviations used are: FADD, Fas-associated via death domain; DR, death receptor; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases; TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase.3The abbreviations used are: FADD, Fas-associated via death domain; DR, death receptor; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; TIMP, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases; TRAIL, tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase. to the death domain of the receptor (3Kischkel F.C.

Cell. 1995; 81: 505-512Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar). FADD in turn recruits caspase-8 or -10, which become activated by autoproteolysis and initiate the apoptotic caspase cascade (5Boldin M.P. Goncharov T.M. Goltsev Y.V. Wallach D. Cell. 1996; 85: 803-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2109) Google Scholar). Notably, two ligands are best characterized for their ability to predominantly induce apoptosis: Fas ligand and TRAIL (6Suda T. Takahashi T. Golstein P. Nagata S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1169-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2444) Google Scholar, 7Wiley S.R. Schooley K. Smolak P.J. Din W.S. Huang C.P. Nicholl J.K. Sutherland G.R. Smith T.D. Rauch C.

These ligands play a role in the immune surveillance of tumor cells by natural killer cells and cytotoxic lymphocytes which express them on the cell surface and induce apoptosis by binding to their receptors on target tumor cells (8Igney F.H.

Science. 1997; 276: 111-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (1557) Google Scholar). TRAIL has been found to induce apoptosis preferentially in tumor cells (7Wiley S.R. Schooley K. Smolak P.J. Din W.S.

Fas ligand and TRAIL may also be cleaved off the cell surface by matrix metalloproteinases or cysteine proteases, respectively resulting in soluble ligands (13Mariani S.M. Krammer P.H. Eur. J.

Immunol. 1995; 25: 2303-2307Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Signaling by death receptors in tumors is inhibited at numerous points in the signaling cascade. Decoy receptors that lack a functional death domain or soluble receptors reduce the effective ligand concentration (11Pan G. Ni J. Wei Y.F. Yu G. Gentz R. Dixit V.M.

FADD-homologous ICE/CED-3-like protease (or FLICE)-like inhibitory proteins, which resemble caspase-8 but lack catalytic activity, can bind to FADD instead of caspase-8 end thereby prevent the initiation of the caspase cascade (17Irmler M. Thome M. Hahne M. Schneider P. Hofmann K. Steiner V. Bodmer J.L. Schroter M. Burns K. Mattmann C. Rimoldi D. French L.E. Tschopp J. Nature. 1997; 388: 190-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2223) Google Scholar). Additionally, inactivating deletions and mutations of Fas, DR4, and DR5 have been found in tumor samples (18Maeda T. Yamada Y. Moriuchi R. Sugahara K. Tsuruda K. Joh T. Atogami S. Tsukasaki K. Tomonaga M. Kamihira S. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1063-1071Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 19Shin M.S. Kim H.S. Lee S.H.

Further downstream and not limited to death receptor signaling, various components of the apoptosis machinery are differentially expressed or mutated in tumors (8Igney F.H. Krammer P.H. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 277-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (1638) Google Scholar). We set out to attempt to identify as many genes as possible that are involved in the mediation of anti-apoptotic mechanisms in cancer cells. Here we focused on three gene families that play key roles in the cellular signal transduction network: protein kinases, protein phosphatases, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). To this end, we took advantage of the genetic instability intrinsic to cancer cells and chose a tumor-derived cell line that is still sensitive to apoptosis induction by Fas. The cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa S3 fulfilled these criteria. Our functional genomics strategy involved the exposure of HeLa S3 cells to the Fas-activating antibody CH-11 and selection of resistant clones. This approach yielded 15 clones that were more resistant to Fas, TRAIL, and starvation-induced cell death than the parental cell line. Subsequently, through the use of cDNA arrays, we identified genes that are differentially expressed in the resistant clones and HeLa S3 and therefore are likely to function as apoptotic regulators. We discovered a novel anti-apoptotic function of the membrane-spanning metalloproteinase MMP-15. Taken together, our results implicate MMP-15 in the manifestation of the anti-apoptotic phenotype in human cancer and validate this enzyme as a novel cancer drug target. Reagents—The cDNA arrays were manufactured in our laboratory. Each array represented 666 genes: 413 protein kinases, 98 protein phosphatases, 31 ligands, 21 matrix metalloproteinases, and a group of 103 genes comprising “housekeeping” genes, various other signal transduction-related genes as well as some viral genes. The cDNA fragments ranging in length from 200 to 2000 bp had been cloned in pBluescript and spotted on nylon membranes (Amersham Biosciences) using a spotter from BioRobotics. As a background control, empty pBluescript was spotted. Each plasmid was spotted twice. Chemiluminescence reagents and [α-33P]ATP were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. The nitrocellulose membrane was from Schleicher & Schüll. The monoclonal α-myc antibody was purified from the hybridoma 9E102 obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), the α-ERK-1/2 antibody (K-23) was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, the a-Fas antibody (UB-2) was from Beckman-Coulter, and all secondary antibodies were from Dianova. The siRNA sequence targeting luciferase (GL2) was described earlier (20Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8144) Google Scholar), the siRNA target sequence for MMP15 was UGA CGC AGC CUA CAC CUA C; the siRNA oligonucleotides were supplied by Dharmacon. Agonistic α-Fas antibody CH-11 was purchased from Beckman-Coulter and TRAIL from TEBU. The oligonucleotide primers and TaqMan probe for quantitative real-time PCR were supplied as “Assays-on-Demand” by Applied Biosystems (ABI). Cell Culture and Cell Death Induction—The cell lines HeLa S3, PC-3, and MCF-7 were purchased from the ATCC and cultivated according to the supplier's recommendations. Mel Juso was from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures and grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. The retroviral packaging cell line Phoenix A was a kind gift by Gary Nolan (Stanford University) and was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 4500 mg/liter glucose, supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. All cell culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen. For cell death assays establishing the apoptosis sensitivity of HeLa S3 and the resistant clones as well as HeLa S3 ectopically expressing MMP-15, cells were seeded at 50% confluency, grown for 2 days, and then treated depending on the apoptotic stimulus. For CH-11-induced cell death, cells were starved without serum for 10 h, CH-11 was added at 100 ng/ml, and cell death was measured after an additional 14 h. For TRAIL-induced cell death, cells were starved for 36 h, TRAIL was added at 100 ng/ml, and cell death was measured after an additional 12 h. For starvation-induced cell death, the cells were starved for 3 days before measuring cell death. For cell death assays after MMP-15 knock-down in HeLa S3 and the resistant clones, siRNA-transfected cells were seeded at 50% confluency and grown for 1 day. Then, cells were starved for 10 h, CH-11 or TRAIL was added at 200 ng/ml, and cell death was measured after further 14 h. Starvation-induced cell death was measured after a total of 3 days of starvation. For cell death assays after MMP-15 knock-down in the other cancer cell lines, siRNA-transfected cells were seeded at 50% confluency and, depending on the cell line, were grown for 1-2 days and treated with 20-300 ng/ml TRAIL for 1 day. Cell death was measured by propidium iodide dye exclusion. Cell Death Assays—Cell death was measured by counting the percentage of hypodiploid cells using flow cytometry as described previously (21Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4421) Google Scholar). Alternatively, cell death was measured by dye exclusion by determining the percentage of dead cells that took up propidium iodide. Flow cytometry was used by gating for the cells that were bigger than the smallest cells (by forward scatter) of the healthy cell population, thus excluding cell debris. Propidium iodide fluorescence was measured in the FL3 channel on a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) or EpicsXL (Beckman-Coulter) flow cytometer. For both assays, cell culture supernatant and trypsinized cells were pooled. Background values without cell death stimulus were subtracted for CH-11- and TRAIL-induced cell death. The correction factor for the siRNA experiments in HeLa S3 and the resistant clones (Fig. 3) was calculated by dividing the -fold down-regulation (i.e. expression level of MMP-15 with GL2 siRNA divided by expression level with MMP-15 siRNA) of HeLa S3 by the -fold down-regulation of the respective clone. This yielded factors 1.5, 1.3, and 1.6 for clones 14, 36, and 58, respectively. Transfection of siRNA and Viral Infection—All cells were seeded at 90% confluency in 12 wells. The next day, 100 pmol of siRNA duplexes per well were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. After 14 h the siRNA duplexes were removed, and the cells were trypsinized and seeded at 50% confluency in 12 wells for further assays. Preparation of viral supernatant and infection of HeLa S3 cells was carried out as described on the Nolan laboratory website (www.stanford.edu/group/nolan/protocols/pro_helper_free.html). After infection, the cells were selected with 0.5 mg/ml G418 for 2 weeks. Cloning of MMP-15—MMP-15 was amplified from HeLa S3 cDNA by PCR using primers flanking the coding region and sequenced. The protein sequence contained a Gly → Arg substitution at position 609 as published previously (22Sato H. Tanaka M. Takino T. Inoue M. Seiki M. Genomics. 1997; 39: 412-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). MMP-15 was cloned into pcDNA 3.1/myc-His (Invitrogen) and subcloned into pLXSN (Clontech) to yield myc-His-tagged MMP-15. Preparation of RNA and cDNA—For cDNA array experiments, the following methods were used: total RNA was extracted from exponentially growing cells kept under normal growth conditions with fetal calf serum using guanidinium thiocyanate as described before (23Puissant C. Houdebine L.M. BioTechniques. 1990; 8: 148-149Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Afterward, mRNA was isolated with the help of oligo-dT cellulose and reverse transcribed using oligo-dT primers (24Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Single-stranded cDNA was purified with the help of the PCR purification kit from Qiagen. For quantitative real-time PCR, total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Kit (Qiagen), and cDNA was prepared using ABI Reverse Transcription Reagents with random hexamer primers according to the manufacturer's protocols. This cDNA was used without further purification in quantitative real-time PCR. Quantitative Real-time PCR and Immunoblotting—Real-time PCR was performed using the PCR Master Mix (ABI) and “Assays on Demand” (ABI) for MMP-15 and β-Actin as a loading control according to the supplier's instructions on an ABI Prism 7000. Expression levels were calculated according to the following formula: 1000* 2(Ct Actin - Ct MMP-15). Cell lysis and immunoblotting were performed as described previously (25Nayler O. Schnorr F. Stamm S. Ullrich A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34341-34348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). cDNA Array Hybridization—Radioactive labeling of the cDNAs was achieved using the Megaprime-DNA labeling kit (Amersham Biosciences) and 50 μCi of [α-33P]ATP per reaction. The labeled cDNA was purified via the Nucleotide Removal Kit from Qiagen and incubated with 0.5 mg/ml COT-DNA (Invitrogen) in hybridization buffer (5× SSC, 0.1% SDS) for 5 min at 95 °C and 30 min at 68 °C to block repetitive sequences in the cDNA. The cDNA was added to pre-warmed (68 °C) hybridization buffer containing 100 μg/ml tRNA (baker's yeast, Roche Applied Science). The cDNA arrays were incubated in pre-hybridization buffer (5× Denhardt's, 5× SSC, 100 mm NaPO4, 2 mm Na4P2O7, 100 μg/ml tRNA) for 4 h and subsequently with the labeled cDNA in hybridization buffer for 16 h. The cDNA was removed, and the cDNA arrays were washed with increasing stringency, dried, and exposed on phosphorimaging plates (Fuji). The plates were read on a FujiBas2500 phosphorimaging device, and the raw spot values (volume) were determined using ArrayVision (RayTest, Canada). Statistical Analysis—The raw DNA microarray intensity data were pre-processed using robust estimation of calibrating and variance-stabilizing transformations (26Huber W. von Heydebreck A. Sültmann H. Poustka A. Vingron M. Bioinformatics. 2002; 18: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). After this, systematic array biases should be removed, and the variance should be approximately independent of the mean intensity. This is useful for subsequent t tests, which were conducted to evaluate the significance level of differences between the gene expression levels in HeLa S3 versus cell death resistant clones. The problem of multiplicity was addressed using the False Discovery Rate criterion (27Benjamini Y. Hochberg Y. J. Royal Stat. Soc. 1995; 85: 289-300Google Scholar, 28Storey J.D. Tibshirani R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 9440-9445Crossref PubMed Scopus (7083) Google Scholar). Class prediction from gene expression profiling was analyzed using the method of “nearest shrunken centroids” (29Tibshirani R. Hastie T. Narasimhan B. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 6567-6572Crossref PubMed Scopus (2157) Google Scholar). This supervised approach identifies subsets of genes that best characterize the two groups HeLa S3 and resistant clones. All these analyses were performed using the statistical computing language “R” and packages implemented for its programming environment freely available under the terms of the Free Software Foundation's GNU General Public License. Literature Search—The literature search was carried out with the help of PubMed at the National Library of Medicine using “<gene name> AND apoptosis” as a search string. Selection of CH-11 Resistant Clones—To select for cells that could resist cell death induced by Fas, we incubated HeLa S3 for 3 days with the agonistic antibody CH-11. To increase the effect, the cells were kept without serum during that time. After 3 days, the vast majority of the cells had died. The medium was exchanged for growth medium without CH-11, containing 10% fetal calf serum, and the remaining single cells were allowed to grow clonally. About 40 clones were obtained per 100,000 seeded cells. Sensitivity of the Clones to Apoptotic Stimuli—We chose to test 15 clones for their resistance to CH-11. We reasoned this number of clones should yield enough statistical power for the following cDNA array analysis, which was intended to find genes that are differentially expressed in all of these clones with respect to parental HeLa S3. As shown in Fig. 1A, all clones were less sensitive to Fas-induced cell death than parental HeLa S3. These data are corroborated by a dose-response study using HeLa S3 and a subset of three clones (Fig. 1B). The resistance to Fas-mediated cell death was not merely caused by down-regulation of Fas, because cell surface expression of Fas as assessed by flow cytometry was even higher in the resistant clones (Fig. 1C). We also asked whether these clones were similarly resistant to other apoptosis inducers. Therefore, we tested the same subset of clones for their sensitivity toward TRAIL- and serum starvation-induced cell death. Fig. 1D shows that these clones were also more resistant to TRAIL-induced cell death, and two of the clones (clones 14 and 58) were more resistant to serum starvation. However, clone 36 was even more sensitive to starvation than the parental cell line HeLa S3. The different apoptosis sensitivities of the clones toward the various inducers show that the clones are indeed different from each other and not mere derivatives of one clonal cell population. Characterization of Resistant Clones by Gene Expression Array Analysis—To investigate the genetic basis of the apoptosis-resistance phenotype in the selected clones, we used cDNA array hybridization to determine the expression level of 666 signal transduction related genes in parental HeLa S3 cells and the apoptosis-resistant clones. These included 413 protein kinases, 98 protein phosphatases, and 21 matrix metalloproteinases. Poly(A+) RNA was isolated from each clone, converted into radioactively labeled cDNA, and hybridized to the macro arrays. Because HeLa S3 was the control for further analysis, we used two independently generated mRNA preparations from HeLa S3, converted the mRNA into [33P]cDNA, and hybridized each cDNA in separate experiments to two cDNA arrays. Together with the double spots of each probe on the arrays (see “Materials and Methods”) this yielded eight data points per gene probe for HeLa S3 and two data points for each clone. We were most interested in the genes that showed a significantly different expression level in all clones compared with HeLa S3. Therefore, we applied a series of t-Tests to detect differentially expressed genes and controlled for multiplicity using the false discovery rate criterion, i.e. the expected ratio of erroneously discovered differentially expressed genes among all the discovered differentially expressed genes. Using this method, we identified 18 genes that were significantly upregulated in the resistant clones and 90 genes that were significantly down-regulated (TABLE ONE and supplemental data) at a false discovery rate of 5%. The up-regulated genes should enhance the resistant phenotype of the clones and hence act anti-apoptotically, whereas the down-regulated genes should act pro-apoptotically. To verify that the employed strategy works in identifying genes that can influence apoptosis, we performed an unbiased literature search of the first 18 genes in the lists of up-regulated and down-regulated genes, respectively. For some genes, an anti-apoptotic as well as a pro-apoptotic role was reported, depending on the experimental conditions used by the investigators. As shown in the fourth column of TABLE ONE, A, all genes that are up-regulated in the resistant clones and that are known to influence apoptosis in one way only (enhance or suppress apoptosis) act anti-apoptotically. Vice versa, the known pro-apoptotic genes outnumber the known anti-apoptotic genes by 7:3 in the list of down-regulated genes (TABLE ONE, B). These results suggest a similar distribution among the genes that had not been linked to apoptosis before, and it confirmed the validity of our strategy.TABLE ONEGenes that are differentially expressed in the resistant clones with respect to parental HeLa S3 (A) Genes that are up-regulated in the clones. (B) The first 18 genes that are down-regulated in the clones. The fourth column shows the result of the unbiased literature search.

We examined the protective properties of chlortetracycline (CTC) and demeclocycline (DMC) and showed that these two tetracyclines were also potent neuroprotective against glutamate-induced neuronal death in vitro and cerebral ischemia in vivo. However, CTC and DMC appeared to confer neuroprotection through a unique mechanism compared with minocycline. Rather than inhibiting microglial activation and caspase, CTC and DMC suppressed calpain activities. In addition, CTC and DMC only weakly antagonized N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activities causing 16 and 14%, respectively, inhibition of NMDA-induced whole cell currents and partially blocked NMDA-induced Ca2+ influx, commonly regarded as the major trigger of neuronal death. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that the two compounds selectively inhibited the activities of calpain I and II activated following glutamate treatment and cerebral ischemia. In contrast, minocycline did not significantly inhibit calpain activity. Taken together, these results suggested that CTC and DMC provide neuroprotection through suppression of a rise in intracellular Ca2+ and inhibition of calpains.

Stroke is one of the most common life-threatening neurological diseases. Despite significant advances in the understanding of the molecular events following cerebral ischemia, there are still no potent neuroprotective therapeutics against stroke-induced brain damage (1Hou S.T.

Chemical compounds directly blocking glutamate toxicity to neurons may have the potential to be developed as therapeutics to stroke. But NMDA receptor blockers, such as MK-801, have failed in human stroke clinical trials due to the severe side effects possibly resulting from interference with the normal physiological functions of the NMDA receptor, despite the fact that compounds like MK-801 are very effective in preventing glutamate-mediated neuronal death in cell culture models (2Hoyte L.

The potential mechanisms of minocycline-mediated neuroprotection are through suppression of microglial activation and inhibition of the release of apoptotic factors such as cytochrome c and attenuation of intracellular caspase activities (21Koistinaho J.

However, it is still not clear whether minocycline interferes with NMDA receptor function. Tetracyclines, in general, have been used safely as an antibiotic agent for many years in the clinic. The properties of clinical tolerance and easy penetration into the brain make some of the tetracycline derivatives potential therapeutic reagents for neuroprotection in stroke (30Klein N.C.

In the present study, we tested the protective effects of two tetracyclines against glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity and cerebral ischemiainduced brain damage. The potential molecular mechanisms of such neuroprotection were also investigated. CTC and DMC were found to be strongly neuroprotective, not through inhibition of the NMDA receptor but rather through suppression of a Ca2+ rise and inhibition of calpain activities. All chemicals and reagents, unless stated otherwise, were purchased from Sigma (Burlington, Ontario, Canada). 5-(6)-Carboxyfluorescein diacetate (CFDA) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). DAKO® fluorescent mounting medium was from Dako Corp. (Carpinteria, CA). Hoechst 33258 was from Aldrich Chemicals (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Protein size markers were obtained from Bio-Rad (Mississauga, Ontario, Canada). Antibodies to spectrin breakdown products were gifts from Dr. J. Durkin as described previously (11Hewitt K.E.

Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG and donkey anti-mouse IgG were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Detection of Western blots utilized ECL-Plus reagents from Amersham Biosciences. Minocycline hydrochloride, CTC hydrochloride, and DMC hydrochloride were purchased from Fluka Chemie (Burlington, Ontario, Canada). Primary cultures of mouse (C57/B6) CGNs were prepared from 6- to 9-day-old postnatal mice as described previously (34Hou S.T. Xie X. Baggley A. Park D.S. Chen G. Walker T. J. Biol.

Mechanical and enzymatic dissociation in a 0.025% w/v trypsin solution for 25 min followed. A trypsin inhibitor was then added to block the enzyme, and 0.05% w/v DNase was added to break DNAs from dead cells. A series of trituration and mild centrifugation steps were included to disperse the neurons prior to resuspension in medium and to remove undissociated debris prior to plating in Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 0.8 mm glutamine, 27 mm glucose, 0.01% gentamycin, 9% fetal bovine serum and supplemented with K+ to a final concentration of 23 mm. Cells were plated onto 24-well dishes containing poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips at a density of 6 × 105 per well. After ∼18 h, cytosine α-d-arabinofuranoside (AraC) was added to a final concentration of 5 μm, to prevent glial cell proliferation. 100-mm dish cultures were seeded with 21 × 106 cells in 10 ml of culture medium. Tetracyclines were added to 8-day in vitro cultured CGNs at 37 °C for 15–20 min prior to treatment with 50 μm glutamate or NMDA. The plates were then incubated for 6 h at 37 °C. Untreated controls were also included. At the end of the treatment period, neuronal viability was measured using the CFDA assay as described previously (34Hou S.T. Xie X. Baggley A. Park D.S. Chen G. Walker T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48764-48770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 35Smith R.A. Walker T. Xie X. Hou S.T. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2003; 116: 70-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The CFDA stock solution was diluted using Earle's balanced salts (Sigma) to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml. Cultures were incubated with 500 μl of the CFDA solution at 37 °C for 30 min. The intensities of fluorescence was quantified using a Cytofluor™ 2350 Fluorescence Measurement System (Millipore) at λex = 480 nm and λem = 530 nm. Cellular viability was normalized against the fluorescent reading from the control cells. Neurons were also fixed in 4% formaldehyde and mounted in Dako® fluorescent mounting medium containing 5 μg/μl Hoechst 33258 to detect nuclei under a fluorescent microscope. Duplicate assessment of each treatment was made on each plate in at least three separate experiments per treatment. Whole-cell recording using electrophysiological methods has been described previously (36Mealing G.A. Lanthorn T.H. Small D.L. Murray R.J. Mattes K.C. Comas T.M. Morley P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2001; 297: 906-914PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, CGNs, cultured on 35-mm culture dishes, were perfused continuously at 1 ml/min at 22 °C using a solution containing 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, 3 mm glucose, pH 7.4. The perfusion solution also contained 1 μm tetrodotoxin, 30 μm glycine, and 1 μm strychnine. Patch pipettes (2–4 mΩ resistance) were constructed from 1.5 mm outer diameter/1.0 mm inner diameter Pyrex 7740 glass (Corning, Big Flats, MN). A modified DAD-12 perfusion system (ALA Scientific Instruments, Westbury, NY) was used to rapidly apply NMDA (2-s duration) followed by co-application of NMDA and the test compound (5-s duration). The pipette solution contained 140 mm CsCl, 1.1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm Mg-ATP at pH 7.2. Whole-cell currents were acquired using an Axopatch 1-D amplifier equipped with a CV-4 head stage with a 1 GΩ feedback resistor (Axon Instruments, Foster City, CA). Voltage command and current acquisition were accomplished using a Digidata 1200 interface and pClamp 6.0 software (Axon Inst). Neurons were held at a membrane potential of –60 mV. The fractional block of NMDA-evoked currents was calculated according to the formula: B = I – IB/I, where I is the steady-state current evoked by NMDA, and IB is the current evoked by NMDA in the presence of the test compound at the end of the co-application. Fluo-4 Measurement—Intracellular calcium concentration was measured as described previously (37Tauskela J.S. Brunette E. Monette R. Comas T. Morley P. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: C899-C911Crossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Briefly, culture medium in the 24-well plate was replaced with a calcium sensitive dye Fluo-4 (4.5 μm) in a balanced salt solution. After 30-min incubation, the dye was removed and cells were incubated with the original medium with or without the compound at 37 °C for 15 min. Fluorescent intensities were quantified using a Cytofluor™ 2350 Fluorescence Measurement System (Millipore) at λex = 485 nm and λem = 530 nm. NMDA (50 μm) was then added to the wells and changes in fluorescence were recorded after 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 min. The fold increase in Ca2+ was calculated by subtracting the initial reading from each reading divided by the initial reading. Ratiometric Measurement of [Ca2+] Using Fura-2—To quantitatively determine the effect of CTC or DMC on glutamate-induced changes in intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]i) level, ratiometric measurement of [Ca2+]i was performed using fura-2 AM. Briefly, mouse CGNs at 7 days in vitro on glass coverslips were loaded with 5 μm fura-2-AM (Molecular Probes) plus 0.02% pluronic (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C. After rinsing with PSS Mg2+-free buffer containing 2 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2.3 mm CaCl2, and 10 mm glucose, and stabilized in the same buffer for 5 min, fura-2 intensities were measured using a Northern Eclipse Digital Ratio Image System (Empix, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) with Axiovert 200 camera and light source (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY). Fura-2 fluorescence was measured at 510 nm emission with 340/380 nm dual excitation selected by a DG-5 system (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA). Changes in [Ca2+]i concentration was measured by converting the 340/380 ratio of fura-2 florescence (after correction for background) to approximate [Ca2+]i using the method as described by Grynkiewicz et al. (38Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and Young et al. (39Young K.W. Garro M.A. Challiss R.A. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 1537-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The 340-to-380 nm fluorescence ratio (R340/380) for 20 cells in one field of each coverslip was averaged. The minimal and maximal fluorescence ratios (Rmin and Rmax) were obtained from a sample set of CGNs using 5 μm ionomycin plus 6 mm EGTA and by 10 mm CaCl2, respectively. The Kd for fura-2 was assumed to be 224 nm as described by Young et al. (39Young K.W. Garro M.A. Challiss R.A. Nahorski S.R. J. Neurochem. 2004; 89: 1537-1546Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The basal level of [Ca2+]i was recorded for 10 s, followed by the application of the compound dissolved in PSS buffer, which also contains 10 μm glycine for another 40 s, and finally glutamate (50 μm) was applied, and the recording was continued for another 200 s. All measurements were repeated for at least three times. The data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel. All procedures using animals were approved by the Institute of Behavioral Science Animal Care Committee following the guidelines established by the Canadian Council on Animal Care. C57B/6 mice (20–23 g) were obtained from Charles River and bred locally. Under temporary isofluorane anesthesia, mice were subjected to MCAO using an intraluminal filament as previously described (40MacManus J.P. Jian M. Preston E. Rasquinha I. Webster J. Zurakowski B. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2003; 23: 1020-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 41Weaver J.G. Tarze A. Moffat T.C. Lebras M. Deniaud A. Brenner C. Bren G.D. Morin M.Y. Phenix B.N. Dong L.

Invest. 2005; 115: 1828-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). After 1 h of MCAO, the filament was withdrawn, blood flow restored to normal by laser Doppler flowmetry, and wounds sutured. Mice were injected with CTC or DMC intraperitoneal at 90 mg/kg body weight 4 h before ischemia, followed by injection twice per day. The control groups included no treatment or vehicle in which animals were injected with the same volume of saline. Brains were removed after 24-h reperfusion, and the brain infarction was measured as described as follows. Infarct size was measured by a colormetric staining method using 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) as described previously (40MacManus J.P. Jian M. Preston E. Rasquinha I. Webster J. Zurakowski B. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 2003; 23: 1020-1028Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 41Weaver J.G. Tarze A. Moffat T.C. Lebras M. Deniaud A. Brenner C. Bren G.D. Morin M.Y.

Invest. 2005; 115: 1828-1838Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Briefly, brains were dissected out and cut into four 2-mm-thick coronal slices, which were stained with 5 ml of 2% TTC for 90 min at 37 °C. Afterward, the tissue was rinsed with saline and subsequently exposed to a mixture of ethanol/dimethyl sulfoxide (1:1), which was to solubilize the formazan product. After 24-h incubation in the dark, the red solvent extracts were diluted 1:20 with fresh ethanol/Me2SO solvent in three tubes and placed in cuvettes. Absorbance was measured at 485 nm in a spectrophotometer and the values were averaged. Percentage loss in brain TTC staining in the ischemic side of the brain was compared with the contralateral side of the brain of the same animal using the following equation: % loss = (1 – (absorbance of ischemic hemisphere/absorbance of contralateral hemisphere) × 100). An expanded six-point scale was modified based on previous reports (40MacManus J.P. Jian M. Preston E. Rasquinha I. Webster J. Zurakowski B. J. Cereb.

Methods. 2000; 94: 187-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and used for the present investigation. Behavioral assessments were made at 0 and 24 h after reperfusion by an individual blinded to the treatment of the mice. The neurological deficits were scored as follows: 0, normal; 1, mild turning behavior with or without inconsistent curling when picked up by tail, <50% attempts to curl to the contralateral side; 2, mild consistent curling, >50% attempts to curl to contralateral side; 3, strong and immediate consistent curling, mouse holds curled position for more than 1–2 s, the nose of the mouse almost reaches tail; 4, severe curling progressing into barreling, loss of walking or righting reflex; 5, comatose or moribund. At least eight mice per group were evaluated for each compound and scores were averaged for statistical analysis. Calpain activity was measured using a calpain activity assay kit (Calbiochem, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) following the manufacture's instructions. The assay is based on fluorometric detection of cleavage of calpain substrate Ac-Leu-Leu-Tyr-AFC using a Cytofluor™ 2350 Fluorescence Measurement System (Millipore). The cleavage resulted in the release of AFC that can be measured in a fluorometer. Briefly, constitutive calpain I or II (0.1 unit/ml) (purchased from Calbiochem) was activated by 500 μm Ca2+ and was mixed with CTC (150 μm), DMC (150 μm), minocycline (150 μm), or calpain inhibitors ALLN or calpastatin (10 μm each) and 5 μl of calpain substrate to a final volume of 100 μl. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 1 h in the dark. The cleavage of the substrate resulted in the release of AFC that can be detected by the Cytofluor at λex = 400 nm and λem = 505 nm. Protein at 10 μg was electrophoresed in a 7% SDS mini gel and then electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane in transfer buffer (39 mm glycine, 48 mm Tris base, and 20% methanol) as described previously (34Hou S.T. Xie X. Baggley A. Park D.S. Chen G. Walker T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 48764-48770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The membrane was then probed with a polyclonal antibody selective to calpain cleaved fragment of brain spectrin at 4 °C overnight. After washing with 0.01 m phosphate-buffered saline, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was applied to the membrane for 1 h at room temperature. Enhanced chemiluminescence detection of the target protein was performed using a LumiGlo substrate kit (KP Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD) and x-ray film. Data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel and Prism. Statistical significance was determined by Student's t test, and the significant group was determined using further post hoc Tuckey's test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. CTC and DMC Protect Cultured CGNs against Glutamate Toxicity—The neuroprotective effects of CTC, DMC, and minocycline against glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in cultured mouse primary CGNs were examined and quantified using the CFDA assay. All three compounds showed potent neuroprotection against glutamate-mediated toxicity to CGNs in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1, A–C). More than 85% of the CGNs were protected by these two compounds at doses ranging between 80 and 150 μm. This protection lasted up to 8 h following glutamate treatment when more than 50% of the control CGNs was killed by glutamate. The appearance of dead neurons was visualized by Hoechst staining of the nuclei (Fig. 1C). CTC and DMC were not toxic to CGNs at the ranges of doses tested (data not shown). CTC and DMC Reduce MCAO-induced Brain Damage—Since minocycline has been shown to provide neuroprotection against cerebral ischemia, we examined the neuroprotective effect of CTC and DMC in a mouse mode"
https://openalex.org/W2006565377,"Recent studies suggest that growth inhibition by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 represents an innovative approach to ovarian cancer therapy. To understand the molecular mechanism of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 action, we profiled the hormone-induced changes in the transcriptome of ovarian cancer cells using microarray technology. More than 200 genes were identified to be regulated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Reverse transcription-PCR analyses confirmed the regulation of a group of apoptosis-related genes, including the up-regulation of the decoy receptor that inhibits tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) action, TRAIL receptor 4, and the down-regulation of Fas, the receptor that mediates the action of Fas ligand. The regulation was further confirmed at the protein level. Consistent with the regulation of the death receptors, pretreatment with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 decreased apoptosis induced by TRAIL and Fas ligand. Because persistent 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 treatment has been shown to induce apoptosis in ovarian cancer, the hormone appears to exert a dual effect on the death of ovarian cancer cells. Knockdown of TRAIL receptor 4 by RNA interference or ectopic expression of Fas relieved the suppressive effect of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, showing that molecular manipulation of death receptors is a viable approach to overcome the protective effect of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 on the apoptosis of ovarian cancer. These strategies may allow ovarian cancer patients to benefit from therapy with both 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 and ligands for death receptors, such as TRAIL, shown to selectively induce apoptosis in cancer but not normal cells.

Its deficiency causes rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults. VD also regulates the proliferation and differentiation of normal and malignant cells of many tissue types. Because sunlight controls the first step of VD synthesis, namely, the photoconversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3 (1Webb A.R. Kline L. Holick M.F. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1988; 67: 373-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (1374) Google Scholar), the hormone is considered a “sun” medicine that is effective for the treatment and/or prevention of type II rickets, osteoporosis, autoimmune disorders, as well as epithelial cancers of many types. vitamin D3 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 ovarian cancer tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand TRAIL receptor 2 TRAIL receptor 4 Fas ligand significance analysis of microarray reverse transcription methylthiazole tetrazolium green fluorescence protein enhanced green fluorescence protein small interference RNA 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin. Ovarian cancer (OCa) is a fatal disease with an overall 5-year survival rate of about 40%. OCa mortality and incidence rates are lower in countries within 20 degrees of the equator (2Muir C. Waterhouse J. Mack T. Powell J. Whelan S. Cancer Incidence in Five Continents, International Agency for Research on Cancer Control (IARC). 1987; V (Scientific Publication No. 88, Vol. , IARC, Lyon, France)Google Scholar) where there is a high amount of sunlight. In the United States, women between the ages of 45 and 54 living in the North have 5 times the OCa mortality rate of women living in Southern states (3Devesa S.S. Grauman M.A. Blot W.J. Pennello G.A. Hoover R.N. Fraumeni Jr., J.F. Atlas of Cancer Mortality in the United States, 1950–1994. 1999; (National Institutes of Health Publication No. 99–4564, NCI, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD)Google Scholar). The inverse correlation between sunlight exposure and OCa mortality indicates that decreased synthesis of VD may contribute to OCa initiation and/or progression. This idea has been further substantiated by recent studies (4Jiang F. Li P. Fornace Jr., A.J. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. J. Biol.

Clin. Cancer Res. 2005; 11: 323-328PubMed Google Scholar). Effects of VD are mediated through the vitamin D receptor (8Baker A.R. McDonnell D.P. Hughes M. Crisp T.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Haussler M.R. Pike J.W. Shine J. O'Malley B.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3294-3298Crossref PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar), which is a member of the steroid/thyroid receptor superfamily of ligand-regulated transcription factors. In response to the activation by 1,25-(OH)2D3, the receptor recruits multiple co-activators, including members of the p160 SRC family (9Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar), which are associated with histone acetyltransferase activity, and the DRIP complex (10Rachez C. Freedman L.P. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 246: 9-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar), which serves as a mediator between the vitamin D receptor and RNA polymerase II complex. Recent studies (11Hedlund T.E. Moffatt K.A. Miller G.J. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1554-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested that the anti-tumor activity of VD is mediated through its effect on gene transcription. In OCa cells, we have shown that the transcriptional up-regulation of GADD45 is essential for the 1,25-(OH)2D3-induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M checkpoint (4Jiang F. Li P. Fornace Jr., A.J. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48030-48040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). 1,25-(OH)2D3 also increases p27 protein stability in OCa cells through down-regulation of Skp2 and cyclin E mRNA to induce cell cycle arrest at the G1/S checkpoint (6Li P. Li C. Zhao X. Zhang X. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25260-25267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). These studies suggest that the action of 1,25-(OH)2D3 through the nuclear activation of vitamin D receptor is important for the anti-tumor activity of the hormone in OCa. Because the anti-tumor activity of 1,25-(OH)2D3 is mediated through regulation of gene expression, a more complete understanding of the mechanism underlying 1,25-(OH)2D3 action in OCa cells necessitates identification of changes in gene expression induced by the hormone. In the present study, we profile transcriptional changes in OVCAR3 cells induced by 1,25-(OH)2D3 using multiple independent microarray analyses. We concentrated our subsequent analysis to a few apoptosis-related genes from this list. Our studies reveal that 1,25-(OH)2D3 regulates the expression of death receptors and protects cancer cells from apoptosis induced by death ligands. The findings suggest that a better understanding of both beneficial and adverse effects of 1,25-(OH)2D3 in OCa cells is necessary for the development of effective OCa therapeutic strategies that utilize active VD compounds, either alone or in combination with other apoptosis-inducing agents. Chemical Reagents, Antibodies, and Cell Cultures—1,25-(OH)2D3 was purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). TRAIL, biological active Fas ligand, staurosporine, calcium ionophore A23187, and etoposide were from Sigma. The antibodies anti-TRAIL (BD Pharmingen), anti-TRAIL receptor 4 (TRAIL-R4), anti-Fas (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA), anti-TRAIL-R2 (Oncogene Research Products, San Diego, CA), and anti-caspase-7 (Cell Signaling Technology Inc., Beverly, MA) were purchased commercially. All cell lines used in the study have been described previously (6Li P. Li C. Zhao X. Zhang X. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25260-25267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). OVCAR3 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 15% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, and 10 μg/ml bovine insulin. Other cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. For 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment, the hormone was dissolved in ethanol, diluted to the desired concentration in culturing medium, and added to the cells. For longer treatments, the medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 1,25-(OH)2D3 or vehicle every third day. Microarray Analyses and Data Statistics—For microarray analyses, OVCAR3 cells at about 70% confluence were treated with 10-7 m 1,25-(OH)2D3 for 0, 8, 24, or 72 h. 1,25-(OH)2D3 was added at different times to allow the treated cells to be harvested at the same time. Ethanol was included as vehicle controls, and all cells were exposed to the same amount of ethanol for the same length of time. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and further purified using Qiagen RNeasy columns. An initial experiment was performed using the U95Av2 chip from Affymetrix Inc. (Santa Clara, CA). From this experiment it was determined that GADD45 expression changed in response to VD (4Jiang F. Li P. Fornace Jr., A.J. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48030-48040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Three subsequent experiments were performed using the U133A chips (Affymetrix Inc.). In these experiments the response of the cells to 1,25-(OH)2D3 was determined by Northern blotting analysis of GADD45 before using the isolated RNA for microarray analysis. The RNA samples were processed for hybridization to microarrays by the Microarray Core Facility of the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center. Briefly, RNA was converted to double-stranded cDNA using an oligo(dT)24 primer containing a T7 promoter sequence. The resulting double-stranded cDNA was transcribed into biotin-labeled cRNA using T7 RNA polymerase. This cRNA was hybridized to GeneChip probe arrays. Unbound RNA was washed from the chips and the remaining biotinylated RNA was stained and the chips scanned. Scanned chip images were analyzed using microarray suite software (MAS 5.0) from Affymetrix. In total, four independent experiments were carried out. Raw data were processed using Irizarry and Speed's Robust Multichip Analysis. After normalization, significance analysis of microarray (SAM) analysis (12Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9802) Google Scholar) was performed by comparing gene expression profiles at time points of 8, 24, and 72 h to those of vehicle control (0 time point). Significant genes were clustered using GeneSpring software 6.0 (Silicon Genetics, Redwood City, CA). This resulted in groupings based on the general pattern of expression changes with time following 1,25-(OH)2D3 addition. The final list of genes was then generated by evaluating each probeset from the SAM analysis for consistency. A gene was considered to be consistently regulated if the same gene expression profile was obtained in all three experiments performed with the U133A chips and detected by all probesets. Gene identification was based on the sequence of the probes used on the arrays (13Harbig J. Sprinkle R. Enkemann S.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 2005; 33: e31Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)— RT-PCR was conducted according to the protocol of Invitrogen with minor modifications. Briefly, 1 μg of pooled RNA from three independent experiments was reverse transcribed with the oligo(dT)20 primer in a total reaction volume of 20 μl. The amplification of target genes was carried out using 1 μl of reverse transcription product in a total reaction volume of 25 μl. PCR was performed using a GeneAmp PCR System 2700 (Applied Biosystem, Inc., Foster City, CA) for about 25 cycles with each cycle consisting of denaturing at 94 °C for 30 s followed by annealing for 45 s at various temperatures (supplemental Table S1) and elongation for 1 min at 72 °C. PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels. Primers were synthesized by Invitrogen and the sequences are listed in supplemental Table S1. Immunoblotting Analysis, Cell Growth, and Apoptotic Assays—For immunoblotting analyses, cellular extracts were separated on SDS-PAGE gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes. Antibodies were used at 1:500 to 1:1000 dilutions. Proteins were detected using ECL as described (6Li P. Li C. Zhao X. Zhang X. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25260-25267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To assay cell growth, methylthiazole tetrazolium (MTT) assays were performed as described (6Li P. Li C. Zhao X. Zhang X. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25260-25267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). For each data point, eight samples were analyzed in parallel. Absorption at 595 nm (A595 nm) was measured on a MRX microplate reader (DYNEX Technologies, Chantilly, VA). The apoptotic index of cells treated with death ligands and 1,25-(OH)2D3 was determined by flow cytometry following staining with Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide according to the manufacturer's protocol (Annexin V kit, Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.). Flow cytometry was performed in a BD Biosciences FACS-Calibur flow cytometer. The data from 10,000 cells per time point were acquired and analyzed using CellQuest software. The apoptotic index of transfected cells was determined as previously described (6Li P. Li C. Zhao X. Zhang X. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25260-25267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Transfected cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde/phosphate-buffered saline and stained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole. The apoptotic index of green fluorescence protein (GFP)-positive cells was determined by scoring 400 GFP-positive cells in randomly selected microscopic fields for chromatin condensation and apoptotic body formation. Caspase Assays—The activity of caspase-3 was determined by the amount of fluorescent AMC liberated from the cleavage of the peptide substrate, Ac-DEVD-AMC, specific for caspase-3, using an assay kit from BD Biosciences. AMC was measured using a spectrofluorometer at excitation of 380 nm and emission of 420 nm. Caspase-7 activity was similarly determined by the amount of free fluorescent AFC released from substrate, Ac-DEVD-AFC, by caspase-7 immunoprecipitates following the protocol of the assay kit from Cell Signaling (Beverly, MA). AFC fluorescence was measured at excitation of 400 nm and emission of 505 nm. Plasmid, siRNA, and Transfection—TRAIL-R4 specific siRNA was synthesized from Upstate Inc. (Chicago, IL). The sense and antisense sequences were 5′-GGACAUGCAAAGGAAACAAtt-3′ and 5′-UUGUUUCCUUUGCAUGUCCtt-3′, respectively. OVCAR3 cells were transfected with either pCMV-Fas and pEGFP or TRAIL-R4 siRNA using Lipofectamine or Oligofectamine according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). pCMV plasmid and nonspecific siRNA were used as controls. Cells were pretreated with 10-7 m 1,25-(OH)2D3 or vehicle for 3 days before the transfection, then 6 h post-transfection, cells were replaced in fresh medium containing 1,25-(OH)2D3 or vehicle. Forty-eight h later, cells were processed for immunoblotting analyses or treated with TRAIL or Fas ligand for apoptosis assays. Identification of 1,25-(OH)2D3-regulated Genes by Microarray in OVCAR3 Cells—To profile the changes in the pattern of gene expression in human OCa cells induced by 1,25-(OH)2D3, OVCAR3 cells were treated with 10-7 m 1,25-(OH)2D3 for 0, 8, 24, or 72 h in four independent experiments. Total RNA was isolated, reverse transcribed, and subjected to microarray analyses. The first analysis was performed with the U95Av2 Affymetrix chips, which identified GADD45 among many others as being up-regulated. Subsequent analysis with conventional approaches confirmed this and identified GADD45 as a primary target gene for 1,25-(OH)2D3 (4Jiang F. Li P. Fornace Jr., A.J. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48030-48040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). To ensure the reproducibility of the microarray data, three independent analyses were subsequently performed with the U133A Affymetrix chips, which contain 22,283 probe sets and can be used to analyze the expression level of ∼15,000 known human genes. For quality control, RNA samples were first tested by Northern blots for up-regulation of GADD45 to ensure that the cells from which the RNA was isolated had responded to the treatment (data not shown). Samples from cells treated with the hormone for 3 days were included to ensure that genes that are regulated by persistent 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment might be identified. These genes could mediate the anti-tumor activity of the hormone even though they may not be primary target genes. The raw data from the three microarray studies with U133A were first analyzed with SAM (12Tusher V.G. Tibshirani R. Chu G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 5116-5121Crossref PubMed Scopus (9802) Google Scholar), a statistical method based on the conventional t test but developed specifically for microarray analysis. Using the 5% false discovery rate, we found that 710 probesets representing about 500 genes were modulated by 1,25-(OH)2D3. We reduced this list by requiring that a gene must change by at least 2.5-fold at one point during the time course of the experiment. The selected genes were clustered into groups using GeneSpring software, which generated five clusters (Fig. 1), of which, clusters 1 to 3 were up-regulated and clusters 4 and 5 were down-regulated. Genes in clusters 1 and 4 were induced or repressed at 8- or 24-h treatment and prolonged treatment did not change the fold regulation dramatically. Examples are GADD45 and 1,25-(OH)2D3 24-hydroxylase genes, which both contain vitamin D response elements in their genome (4Jiang F. Li P. Fornace Jr., A.J. Nicosia S.V. Bai W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 48030-48040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 14Zou A. Elgort M.G. Allegretto E.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 19027-19034Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Genes in clusters 2 and 5 were steadily up- or down-regulated and their fold regulation kept increasing as the time of treatment was extended. The cyclin A1 gene fell into cluster 3, which was repressed significantly at 8 h treatment but became induced at 72 h (2.58-fold) of 1,25-(OH)2D3 treatment. The final gene list contains only those genes whose pattern of expression was consistent in all three experiments and across all probesets that detect the same gene. This reduced the list to 58 genes that appeared to be up-regulated (TABLE ONE) and 38 genes that appeared to be down-regulated (TABLE TWO). Many of these genes were also identified in the previous experiment using U95Av2 chips (TABLES ONE and TWO).TABLE ONEGenes up-regulated by 1,25-(OH)2D3 (total: 58) Genes are grouped by gene molecular functions.

https://openalex.org/W2044526263,"CD40, a tumour necrosis factor (TNF) receptor family member, is expressed in a variety of cell types, including B lymphocytes, macrophages, fibroblasts, endothelial and epithelial cells, and this widespread expression is likely to account for its central role in normal physiology and disease pathogenesis. In this study, we provide evidence to support a role for constitutive CD40 signalling in cell transformation. We show that the ligand for CD40 (CD40L/CD154) is expressed in CD40-positive human breast tumour biopsies, suggesting that the constitutive activation of the CD40 receptor in vivo may contribute to the oncogenic process. Coexpression of CD40 and CD40L confers oncogenic effects on immortalized human epithelial cells in vitro, increasing their proliferation, motility and invasion. Expression of LMP:CD40, a hybrid molecule comprising the N-terminus and transmembrane domains of the Epstein-Barr virus-encoded latent membrane protein-1 (LMP1) fused to the cytoplasmic tail of CD40, mimics a constitutively active CD40 receptor and promotes the transformation of immortalized rodent fibroblasts in vitro and their oncogenicity in vivo. The observed effects of aberrant CD40 activation on cell transformation are largely diminished upon suppression of the oncogenic NF-kappaB signalling pathway. Taken together, our results suggest a role for the constitutive engagement of the CD40L/CD40/NF-kappaB activation pathway in cell transformation and neoplastic growth. Strategies that neutralize this pathway may therefore be useful in cancer treatment and prevention."

Several types of enzymes with SMase C activity have been identified in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Eukaryotic SMases C have been classified according to their pH optima and are known as acid SMase (1Schuchman E.H. Suchi M. Takahashi T. Sandhoff K. Desnick R.J. J. Biol.

In contrast, bacterial nSMases are secreted proteins and act as membrane damaging virulence factors promoting host tissue colonization. The nSMase produced by the intracellular pathogen L. ivanovii, SmcL, the first for which an unambiguous role in pathogenesis was demonstrated, has been shown to mediate bacterial escape from the phagocytic vacuole following internalization, thereby promoting intracellular survival and replication (10Gonzalez-Zorn B. Dominguez-Bernal G. Suarez M. Ripio M.T. Vega Y. Novella S. Vazquez-Boland J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 510-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). It has also been suggested that in addition to its mechanical role as a phagosome-disrupting factor, SmcL may modulate host cell responses by interfering with the SM-ceramide signaling pathway (10Gonzalez-Zorn B. Dominguez-Bernal G. Suarez M. Ripio M.T. Vega Y. Novella S. Vazquez-Boland J.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 33: 510-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). SmcL and the other bacterial nSMases differ from their eukaryotic homologues in that they lack any obvious membrane-spanning regions. To date, the mechanism by which bacterial nSMases target and bind to membranes to access their substrate has not been determined.Although sequence alignments of bacterial and eukaryotic nSMases reveal they are only distantly related (11Rodrigues-Lima F.

(Tokyo). 2003; 133: 279-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). These residues are also conserved in the DNase I-like family of Mg2+-dependent phosphodiesterases, again despite low overall sequence homology. Based on this conservation, nSMases have been predicted to adopt an overall fold similar to DNase I and a molecular model of the B. cereus enzyme has been produced (19Matsuo Y. Yamada A. Tsukamoto K. Tamura H. Ikezawa H. Nakamura H. Nishikawa K. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2459-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).

The Mg2+ ion acts as a Lewis acid to stabilize the pentavalent phosphoryl intermediate, and this ion is coordinated by a conserved glutamate residue (18Obama T. Kan Y. Ikezawa H. Imagawa M.

There are currently no known lipid-specific phosphodiesterases (phospholipases) that adopt the DNase I-like fold. Therefore, the structure of SmcL would provide the first picture of a new class of phospholipase.An increasing number of nSMase homologues are being uncovered through genome sequencing projects. New members of the nSMase family have been identified in clinically important pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (27Vargas-Villarreal J. Mata-Cardenas B.D. Deslauriers M. Quinn F.D. Castro-Garza J. Martinez-Rodrlguez H.G. Said-Fernandez S. Med. Sci. Monit. 2003; 9: BR225-BR230PubMed Google Scholar) and the malaria protozoan parasite Plasmodium falciparum (28Hanada K.

Because of their potential as a target to interfere with infectious pathogenesis or sphingolipid signaling and metabolic disorders, interest in nSMases has increased significantly in recent years, with a number of attempts to generate specific inhibitors (29Luberto C. Hassler D.F. Signorelli P. Okamoto Y. Sawai H. Boros E. Hazen-Martin D.J. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. Smith G.K. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 67: 4839-4846Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). However, no high resolution experimentally determined structural information is currently available for the protein family that could be valuable in understanding the mechanism of action of such molecules or in the design of active compounds. This lack of structural information also leaves many fundamentally important questions unanswered. For instance, does the overall fold and active site of bacterial and eukaryotic nSMases truly resemble DNase I? What differences are identifiable in the arrangement of the catalytic site compared with other structurally related (DNase I-like) proteins? When all related proteins of known structure are not active on phospholipids, how do nSMases target and bind SM as a substrate? The crystal structure of L. ivanovii SMase C (SmcL) presented here provides the first opportunity to understand the details of structure/function relationships in nSMases at the atomic level.MATERIALS AND METHODSCloning, Protein Expression, and Purification—DNA encoding SmcL was generated by PCR from L. ivanovii PAM55 genomic DNA using primers 5′-GGAGGACATATGGAAAAATTTAAAA-3′ and 5′-TAAGCTAGATTGGAATTCCTGG-3′. These primers contained NdeI and EcoRI restriction sites (underlined) to facilitate subsequent cloning. The EcoRI site is downstream of the genome-encoded stop codon. The catalytic domain was then subcloned, without the signal sequence for extracellular secretion, by PCR from a vector encoding the full-length protein using primers 5′-CATATGGCTAGTGATGAGT-3′ and the generic T7-terminator sequence. The forward primer was designed to introduce an NdeI restriction site (underlined) and start methionine followed by residue Gln36 of the native sequence. This start site was determined by comparison with other mature bacterial nSMases for which the N-terminal residues are known (31Dziewanowska K. Edwards V.M. Deringer J.R. Bohach G.A. Guerra D.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 335: 102-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). This PCR product was cloned into pGEM-T (Novagen) and checked for PCR-induced mutations by DNA sequencing. The pGEM-T: SmcL vector was then cut with NdeI and XhoI and cloned into pET27b (Promega), cut with the same enzymes. The resulting plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), and protein of the correct size was observed in small scale expression tests. For overexpression of SmcL, BL21(DE3) cultures were grown to a density of ∼0.4-0.6 A600 at 37 °C, induced with 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (final concentration), and grown overnight at 20 °C to maximize the yield of soluble protein. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 20 mm BisTris, 2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm NaCl, pH 6.0, lysed by sonication, and clarified by centrifugation. The resulting supernatant was passed through two 5-ml Hi-Trap SP-Sepharose FF columns linked in tandem. Protein was eluted with a 0-50% gradient over 15 column volumes (elution buffer as above with 1 m NaCl). The predominant peak, eluting at ∼35% elution buffer was confirmed to be SmcL by SDS-PAGE. Fractions containing the protein were pooled, concentrated by ultrafiltration, and passed through a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex-75 gel filtration column. Gel filtration buffer comprised 20 mm BisTris, 2 mm MgCl2, 250 mm NaCl, pH 6.0. The single major peak was confirmed to be SmcL by SDS-PAGE, with purity judged to be >95%. Fractions containing SmcL were pooled and concentrated to 10 mg/ml by ultrafiltration as judged by absorbance at 280 nm. A typical yield was 10 mg/liter of culture. Catalytic activity against SM was confirmed using a sphingomyelinase assay kit (Molecular Probes, data not shown). Dynamic light scattering showed the protein was monodisperse and most likely monomeric in solution (data not shown).Crystallization and Data Collection—Initial crystals of SmcL were obtained by hanging drop vapor diffusion from an in-house screen based on previously described conditions (32Page R. Grzechnik S.K. Canaves J.M. Spraggon G. Kreusch A. Kuhn P. Stevens R.C. Lesley S.A. Acta Crystallogr.D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 1028-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Screening around these conditions led to diffraction quality crystals produced using 16-22% PEG 8000, 100-250 mm sodium dihydrogen phosphate, 200 mm sodium chloride, 100-250 mm sodium citrate, pH 4-4.8. Crystals appeared in 2-3 days and grew to maximal size (∼0.3 ×∼0.3 ×∼0.1 mm) in ∼2 weeks. Prior to data collection crystals were cryoprotected with the relevant reservoir solution but with 20% PEG 8000 and 20% glycerol. Initial native and the derivative diffraction data were collected on an R-AXIS IV++ detector with x-rays from a Rigaku Micromax007 generator with “blue” optics. All data were processed with MOSFLM (33Leslie A. Joint CCP4 + ESF-EAMCB Newsletter on Protein Crystallography. 1992; Google Scholar) and scaled with SCALA, as implemented in the CCP4 suite (34P4 CC Acta Crystallogr.D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19704) Google Scholar). The initial native dataset revealed the protein crystallized in P31/221 with unit cell dimensions a = b = 67.19 Å, c = 180.88 Å. Assuming a solvent content of 59% the asymmetric unit contained one molecule. The single derivative required to phase the data were prepared by soaking a crystal in the relevant reservoir solution, but with 20% PEG 8000 and 5 mm potassium hexachloroiridate(IV), for 24 h. High-resolution native data were collected at the Daresbury-SRS (station 14.1) to 1.9 Å on an ADSC quantum4 CCD detector.

SOLVE (35Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr.D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar) was used to perform all steps of phasing including site identification, site refinement, and calculation of phases. A single major iridium site was found, and the final figure of merit was 0.31. These phases were modified and extended to the resolution limit of the in-house native data (2.6 Å) using RESOLVE (36Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr.D Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar). At this stage the experimental phases were combined with the high-resolution native dataset, and a second round of RESOLVE extended the phases to 1.9 Å (final figure of merit for all data = 0.49) and automatically built an initial model (37Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr.D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 1937-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). This model was used to guide subsequent manual building. Inspection of the resulting electron density maps showed the correct space group to be P3121.Iterative building and refinement steps used the programs “O” (38Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar) and Refmac5, as implemented in CCP4 (34P4 CC Acta Crystallogr.D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19704) Google Scholar). The initial manual build of the protein into the 1.9-Å experimental map placed 275 (of 300) amino acids, all assigned to sequence. The first refinement cycle, starting with prior-phase weighting and overall B-factor refinement and ending with no prior-phase weighting and isotropic B-factor refinement, resulted in an R-factor of 28.9%, and Rfree (5% of data) of 31.1%. Repeated rebuilding (using σ-weighted 2Fo - Fc and Fo - Fc maps) and refinement of the structure (including one phosphate, one glycerol, and 244 water molecules) reduced the R-factor to 20.1% (Rfree = 23.3%).RESULTSOverall Structure—The final model of SmcL comprises 288 amino acids, 1 phosphate, 1 glycerol, and 244 water molecules with a converged R-factor of 20.1% (Rfree = 23.3%) for all data between 30- and 1.9-Å resolution. The r.m.s. deviation for bond lengths is 0.016 Å and bond angles is 1.43°. The overall structure of SmcL is shown in Fig. 2, a and b. The electron density (and therefore the model) is continuous throughout the sequence from residue Tyr-41 through Asn-333 except for a break between Gly-125 and Ala-131 (note: all numbering for SmcL is from the start methionine of the protein, including the signal sequence). A representative example of the electron density is shown in Fig. 3. The Ramachandran plot as produced by MOLEMAN2 (39Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A.

Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 2459-2467Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), but not confirmed before this study, the structure of SmcL adopts a DNase I-like fold as defined by SCOP (41Murzin A.G. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T. Chothia C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 247: 536-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (5567) Google Scholar). This fold is dominated by a central β-sandwich, flanked by α-helices and loops (see Fig. 2, a and b). The closest structural homologue to SmcL, as identified by structural similarity searches (42Holm L. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 123-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (3551) Google Scholar), is E. coli exonuclease III (Protein Data Bank code 1AKO, Z-score 19.8, r.m.s. deviation 3.5 Å for 223 residues). A further seven proteins form a cluster of DNase I-like structures (Z-scores of 15.3-19.6, next highest hit: 5.3), including bovine DNase I (PDB code 3DNI, Z-score 17.7, r.m.s. deviation 3.2 Å for 218 residues), and Schizosaccharomyces pombe inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (PDB code 1I9Y, Z-score 18.9, r.m.s. deviation 3.0 Å for 212 residues). These proteins only share 14-17% sequence identity with SmcL. Although functionally and mechanistically similar (except the second phosphodiesterase bond is cleaved), the overall structure of SmcL shows no similarity to the recently determined Loxosceles laeta SMase D, which adopts a (β/α)8 TIM-barrel fold (43Murakami M.T.

Chem. 2005; 280: 13658-13664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Catalytic Site—By homology to DNase I and other structurally related proteins, the active site of SmcL is readily identifiable within a deep, solvent-accessible pocket in the structure located at the top of the β-sandwich, and surrounded by long loops that connect the secondary structure elements of the protein (Fig. 2, a and b). The arrangement of residues that form the core catalytic center are shown in Fig. 4. All (bacterial and non-bacterial) nSMases identified to date contain two conserved histidine residues (His-185 and His-325 in SmcL, Fig. 1), which mutagenesis and kinetic studies of the B. cereus nSMase (and homology to DNase I) suggest are the general acid and general base of the catalytic mechanism (17Obama T. Fujii S. Ikezawa H. Ikeda K. Imagawa M. Tsukamoto K. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2003; 26: 920-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A conserved aspartate, Asp-282, binds to the ND1 atom of His-325 facilitating its action as the general base (raising the pKa), and ensuring correct positioning. Another conserved aspartate, Asp-229, occupies a position between the two catalytic histidines and is likely to help spatially orient these residues. Interestingly, and distinct from DNase I, His-185 does not have a carboxylate group bound to its side chain. Instead, a buried water molecule is bound to the ND1 atom, with the free NE2 atom facing the active site cavity. In addition to the ND1 atom of His-185 this water molecule is hydrogen bonded to main chain atoms Glu-88:N, Gly-135:O, and forms part of an extended hydrogen-bonded network that also includes a second buried water molecule (see Fig. 4). These bonds appear to act as a network to correctly orient the side chain of His-185, but would not be expected to alter the pKa. The presence of a carboxyl"
https://openalex.org/W2056259311,"To study the conformational changes that convert G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) from their resting to their active state, we used the M3 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor, a prototypical class A GPCR, as a model system. Specifically, we employed a recently developed in situ disulfide cross-linking strategy that allows the formation of disulfide bonds in Cys-substituted mutant M3 muscarinic receptors present in their native membrane environment. At present, little is known about the conformational changes that GPCR ligands induce in the immediate vicinity of the ligand-binding pocket. To address this issue, we generated 11 Cys-substituted mutant M3 muscarinic receptors and characterized these receptors in transfected COS-7 cells. All analyzed mutant receptors contained an endogenous Cys residue (Cys-5327.42) located within the exofacial segment of transmembrane domain (TM) VII, close to the agonist-binding site. In addition, all mutant receptors harbored a second Cys residue that was introduced into the exofacial segment of TM III, within the sequence Leu-1423.27-Asn-1523.37. Disulfide cross-linking studies showed that muscarinic agonists, but not antagonists, promoted the formation of a disulfide bond between S1513.36C and Cys-532. A three-dimensional model of the inactive state of the M3 muscarinic receptor indicated that Cys-532 and Ser-151 face each other in the center of the TM receptor core. Our cross-linking data therefore support the concept that agonist activation pulls the exofacial segments of TMs VII and III closer to each other. This structural change may represent one of the early conformational events triggering the more pronounced structural reorganization of the intracellular receptor surface. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first direct demonstration of a conformational change occurring in the immediate vicinity of the binding site of a GPCR activated by a diffusible ligand."

Block of N-linked glycosylation inhibited AChR assembly whereas block of glucose trimming partially blocked assembly at the late stages. Removal of each of seven glycans had a distinct effect on AChR assembly, ranging from no effect to total loss of assembly. Because the chaperone calnexin (CN) associates with N-linked glycans, we examined CN interactions with AChR subunits. CN rapidly associates with 50% or more of newly synthesized AChR subunits, but not with subunits after maturation. Block of N-linked glycosylation or trimming did not alter CN-AChR subunit associations nor did subunit mutations prevent N-linked glycosylation. Additionally, CN associations with subunits lacking N-linked glycans occurred without subunit aggregation or misfolding. Our data indicate that CN associates with AChR subunits without N-linked glycan interactions.

Resident chaperone proteins facilitate protein folding while processing enzymes catalyze post-translational protein processing events such as the addition of asparagine (N)-linked glycans and disulfide bond formation. The role of N-linked glycans in protein folding, assembly, and function is not clearly defined. Prevention of N-linked glycosylation has varied effects among proteins and depends on many different factors (1Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar). One function of N-linked glycosylation is to mediate associations with certain ER-resident chaperones. Whereas most ER-resident chaperone proteins bind directly to polypeptide regions of proteins, calnexin (CN) and calreticulin (CRT) can bind to N-linked glycans of proteins via its lectin binding domain. Both specifically associate with monoglucosylated Glc1Man9GlcNAc2 oligosaccharides transiently during glucose trimming of N-linked glycans in the ER (reviewed in Refs. 1Helenius A. Aebi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 1019-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1579) Google Scholar, 2Parodi A.J. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 3Kleizen B. Braakman I. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2004; 16: 343-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). As a lectin, CN binds glycans to deliver proteins to other chaperones and processing enzymes. Recent studies suggest that CN is part of a larger complex that contains other components such as the thiol oxidoreductase ERp57 (reviewed in Ref. 4Ellgaard L. Frickel E.M. Cell Biochem. Biophys. 2003; 39: 223-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Can CN bind its substrates through an N-linked glycosylation-independent mechanism? Several studies found that CN interactions with proteins occur after enzymatic removal of glycans (5Ware F.E. Vassilakos A. Peterson P.A. Jackson M.R. Lehrman M.A. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4697-4704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 6Williams D.B. Biochem.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 17253-17261Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Also, CN associates with proteins not N-linked glycosylated, such as the T-cell receptor ϵ-subunit (14Rajagopalan S. Xu Y. Brenner M.B. Science. 1994; 263: 387-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), a mutant proteolipid protein (15Swanton E. High S. Woodman P. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 2948-2958Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) or proteins mutated to eliminate consensus N-linked glycosylation sites, such as the multidrug P-glycoprotein (16Loo T.W. Clarke D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28683-28689Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recent results using various CN deletion or point mutations found regions of CN that can prevent aggregation of non-glycosylated proteins (17Leach M.R. Cohen-Doyle M.F. Thomas D.Y. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 6: 6Google Scholar, 18Leach M.R. Williams D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9072-9079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These results support a role for a lectin-independent association between CN and its substrates. However, other studies question this conclusion. Mutations of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G protein that remove N-linked glycosylation sites associate with CN but, it was concluded that the glycan-independent associations were a result of nonspecific aggregation of mutant VSV G and CN (11Cannon K.S. Hebert D.N. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14280-14284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Another possible explanation for glycosylation independent CN associations is that the observed polypeptide associations are with chaperones that are part of a larger scaffold of chaperones that includes CN. Within this scaffold of chaperones, other chaperones could directly interact with the nascent protein via polypeptide associations resulting in the observed but indirect CN association. In this study, we have examined the role of N-linked glycosylation on the folding and assembly of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs). Muscle-type AChRs are composed of four homologous subunits, α, β, γ (or ϵ), and δ, which assemble into α2βγδ pentamers in the ER (19Smith M.M. Lindstrom J. Merlie J.P. J. Biol.

Wanamaker C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20945-20953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and addition of N-linked glycans (24Sumikawa K. Gehle V.M. J. Biol.

Brain Res. 1997; 45: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) are critical for proper AChR assembly in the ER. Coincident with these events, CN associates with AChR subunits (22Gelman M.S. Chang W. Thomas D.Y. Bergeron J.J. Prives J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15085-15092Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 26Keller S.H. Lindstrom J. Taylor P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22871-22877Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To further examine the role of N-linked glycosylation and CN in AChR assembly, we used AChR subunits from Torpedo californica. Antibodies (Abs) specifically recognize and immunoprecipitate each of the four Torpedo AChR subunits unlike subunits cloned from other species. Torpedo subunits are also less prone to proteolysis after solubilization and have the added advantage that assembly is temperature-dependent, which allows assembly to be synchronized and significantly slowed compared with avian and mammalian AChRs (27Green W.N. Claudio T. Cell. 1993; 74: 57-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). Using the Torpedo subunits, we found that treatment with castanospermine (CAS), which can disrupt interactions between CN and other glycoproteins, blocked the late stages in AChR assembly. In contrast, CN rapidly associated with newly synthesized AChR subunits but not with partially mature AChR subunits during the late stages of AChR assembly. Moreover, the interaction between CN and AChR subunits was not altered by CAS, tunicamycin (TUN) treatment, or by AChR subunits mutated to prevent the addition of N-linked glycans. Our data indicate that CN can associate with AChR subunits without interacting with N-linked glycans, and that CN has no role in subunit assembly events that require N-linked glycosylation. Tissue Culture—We used the tsA201 cell line, a human embryonic kidney cell line (28Margolskee R.F. McHendry-Rinde B. Horn R. BioTechniques. 1993; 15: 906-911PubMed Google Scholar), for all transient transfections. Cells were maintained at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% calf serum. Mouse L fibroblast cells, stably transfected with Torpedo α-, β-, γ-, and δ-subunits (29Claudio T. Green W.N. Hartman D.S. Hayden D. Paulson H.L. Sigworth F.J. Sine S.M. Swedlund A. Science. 1987; 238: 1688-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% calf serum and 15 μg/ml hypoxanthine, 1 μg/ml aminopterin, and 5 μg/ml thymidine. 20 mm sodium butyrate was added to medium 1–5 days prior to assay to enhance AChR expression. Construction of Glycosylation Mutants—We created glycosylation mutants of the AChR subunits to test the lectin specificity of CN for the AChR subunits. N-linked glycans are added to asparagines found in asparagine-X-serine/threonine (NX(S/T)) recognition sequences in proteins. In each of the glycosylation mutants, the S or T of the NX(S/T) consensus sequence was changed to an alanine. The γN2 and δN2 glycosylation mutants were a kind gift from Dr. K. Sumikawa (University of Irvine, Ref. 25Gehle V.M. Walcott E.C. Nishizaki T. Sumikawa K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1997; 45: 219-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To create the double and triple mutants of the γ- and δ-subunits unique restriction sites between the now removed N-linked glycans were used to create the γN1N2, δN1N2, δN1N3, δN2N3, and δN1N2N3. All mutants were sequenced to ensure no errors were introduced by the PCR. Transient Transfection—The wild-type and mutant Torpedo AChR subunit cDNAs in the pRBG4 expression vector (30Lee B.S. Gunn R.B. Kopito R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11448-11454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the canine CN-HA cDNA in the pREP8 vector (Invitrogen, Ref. 31Wada I. Imai S. Kai M. Sakane F. Kanoh H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 20298-20304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) or the mouse GRP94-FLAG in the pFLAG-CMV-1 vector (Kodak) were transiently transfected into 6-cm cultures of tsA201 cells using a calcium phosphate method (32Eertmoed A.L. Vallejo Y.F. Green W.N. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 564-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Metabolic Labeling, Solubilization, and Subunit Immunoprecipitations—To enhance subunit expression in the mouse L fibroblasts, stably transfected with the Torpedo subunit cDNAs (All-11 cells), cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 20 mm sodium butyrate 36 h before the experiment. Cultures in 10-cm plates were metabolically labeled as described previously (23Green W.N. Wanamaker C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20945-20953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 27Green W.N. Claudio T. Cell. 1993; 74: 57-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 33Green W.N. Wanamaker C.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5555-5564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cultures were starved in methionine-cysteine (Met/Cys)-free DMEM for 15 min and then pulse-labeled at 37 °C in Met/Cys-free DMEM supplemented with 333 μCi of a [35S]Met [35S]Cys mixture ([35S]Met/Cys, NEN EXPE35S35S). Cells that were chased (Fig. 1, B and C) were washed two more times with the DMEM containing 5 mm Met/Cys and chased in medium. When added, 1 mm CAS was included in the sodium butyrate medium 2 h prior to labeling, as well as, during the label and chase. Cells were solubilized in lysis buffer composed of 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4, 2 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride plus 0.02% NaN3, 1.83 mg/ml phosphatidylcholine, and 1% Lubrol (LPC). Solubilized AChR subunits were purified using either a single immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1, D and E) or nondenaturing double immunoprecipitation protocol (Figs. 2E and 3B). The double immunoprecipitation protocol involved first immunoprecipitating cell lysates with an AChR subunit-specific monoclonal antibody (mAb). The first immunoprecipitation was then purified with protein G-Sepharose. The Sepharose beads bound to mAb-AChR subunit complexes were washed and treated with 100 mm glycine pH 2.5 to remove the subunit complexes from the Sepharose. The eluted subunit complexes were immunoprecipitated a second time with either the same subunit-specific or an N-terminal anti-CN Ab (Stressgen). The second Ab-subunit complexes were purified with protein A-Sepharose because the subunit-specific mAbs used in the first immunoprecipitations are not recognized by protein A. The final immunoprecipitations were washed three times, run on non-reducing 7.5% SDS-PAGE, fixed, treated 30 min with Amplify (Amersham Biosciences) to enhance the signal, dried, and exposed to film at –80 °C with an intensifying screen. The subunit band intensity was scanned using a Typhoon 8600 PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) and quantified using the ImageQuant software included with the Typhoon. Autoradiographs were also quantified by scanning densitometry using a scanner and analyzed with the same ImageQuant software. To ensure that quantified bands were in the linear range and darker signals were not saturated, at least three different autoradiographic exposures were taken for each experiment.FIGURE 2Calnexin interacts with newly synthesized AChR subunits but not with subunits later in assembly. A, amount of CN immunodepleted by the anti-CN Ab was determined by overlaying Western blots with the anti-CN Ab. Total cell lysate from a single 10-cm plate of mouse L fibroblasts stably expressing the Torpedo subunits was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated (lane 1) and compared with total cell lysate that was immunoprecipitated with the anti-CN Ab before the trichloroacetic acid precipitation (lane 2; n = 5). The increase in CN expression was also measured by comparing sham-transfected cells (lane 4) to cells transfected with CN-HA (lane 3) by overlaying Western blots with anti-CN Ab (n = 4). B, cells transiently expressing CN-HA along with one of the four AChR subunits were [35S]Met/Cys pulse-labeled. Labeled lysates were split into two equal aliquots, immunoprecipitated with a subunit-specific Ab (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7) or an HA-specific Ab (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8), and compared with each other (see TABLE ONE; n = 5–7; ± S.E. for each subunit). C, to determine if transient overexpression leads to an increase in AChR subunit associated with a chaperone, cells transiently expressing GRP94-FLAG along with one of the four AChR subunits were [35S]Met/Cys pulse-labeled. Labeled lysates were split into two equal aliquots and immunoprecipitated with a subunit-specific Ab (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7) or a FLAG-specific mAb (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8). D, purification of nonspecific in vitro associations between CN-HA and AChR subunits. Cells transiently expressing CN-HA or one of the four AChR subunits were [35S]Met/Cys pulse-labeled. Labeled CN-HA lysates were combined with the labeled single AChR subunit lysates. These newly combined cell lysates were split into two equal aliquots and immunoprecipitated with a subunit-specific Ab (lanes 1, 3, 5, 7) or an anti-HA Ab (lanes 2, 4, 6, 8). E, cells stably expressing the Torpedo subunits were [35S]Met/Cys pulse-labeled. Labeled α-, β-, γ-, and δ-subunits were subjected to the double immunoprecipitation protocol (see “Materials and Methods”). Subunits that co-precipitate after a single immunoprecipitation were mostly lost because of the glycine treatment. F, CN does not associate with intracellular Bgt binding AChRs. Cells stably expressing the four Torpedo AChR subunits were shifted to 20 °C to begin AChR assembly. After 0, 3, 6, 24, and 48 h at 20 °C, the intracellular AChRs were isolated and bound to 10 nm 125I-Bgt along with an anti-γδ or anti-CN Ab. Fraction of maximum values shown were calculated by dividing all 125I-Bgt counts by the number of 125I-Bgt counts in the γδ subunit-specific Ab-purified vector samples (n = 3).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3CAS, TUN, or DTT do not prevent associations between CN and AChR subunits. A, cells transiently expressing CN-HA and each of the AChR subunits were treated with 1 mm CAS and [35S]Met/Cys pulse-labeled. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a subunit-specific (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) or a HA-specific Ab (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). The presence of CAS only slightly decreased the amount of δ associated with CN-HA as compared with Fig. 2B (TABLE ONE). B, cells stably expressing the Torpedo AChR subunits were [35S]Met/Cys pulse-labeled, and cell lysates were double immunoprecipitated as in Fig. 2E. 1 mm CAS was present in the medium in lanes labeled with Cas (+). For all four subunits, the presence of CAS had little to no effect on the associations between the subunits and CN when compared with Fig. 2E. C, cells transiently expressing CN-HA and one of the four AChR subunits were treated with 12 μm TUN and [35S]Met/Cys, pulse-labeled. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with a subunit-specific Ab (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) or a HA-specific Ab (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). The presence of TUN had little to no effect on the associations between the subunits and CN-HA (TABLE ONE). D, cells transiently expressing CN-HA and either the α-or β-AChR subunit were pretreated and pulse-labeled in the absence (lanes 1, 2, 5, and 6) or presence of 5 mm DTT (lanes 3, 4, 7, and 8). Cell lysates were split in equal halves and immunoprecipitated with a subunit-specific (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) or anti-HA Ab (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). The presence of DTT had little to no effect on the associations between the subunits and CN-HA when +DTT lanes are compared with –DTT lanes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To [35S]Met/Cys-labeled cells transiently transfected, cells were pulse-labeled for 5 min 18–24 h post-transfection as above except 111 μCi of [35S]Met/Cys was used. When 5 mm DTT was added to the cells, it was present in the medium 15 min before and during the 5-min pulse label (Fig. 3D). On the other hand, 1 mm CAS or 12 μm TUN was included in the medium 2 h prior to labeling, as well as during the label. Following the label, the cells were washed three times and solubilized in 1% LPC. 20 mm NEM was added to the LPC when solubilizing the DTT-treated cells to prevent formation of nonspecific disulfide bonds after solubilization. The cell lysates were then split into two equal aliquots and immunoprecipitated with a subunit-specific or an anti-HA-specific Ab, that quantitatively precipitates CN-HA (data not shown). The immunoprecipitations were protein G-Sepharose-purified, washed three times, run on non-reducing SDS-PAGE, and band intensities quantified as above. Western Blots—To determine the amount of CN immunodepleted by the anti-CN Ab, a 1:100 dilution of anti-CN Ab (Stressgen) was added to LPC solubilized 10-cm plate of All-11 cells (Fig. 2A, lane 2). The Ab-CN complex was purified with protein-G-Sepharose, and the resulting supernatant was trichloroacetic acid-precipitated. Total CN was determined by not immunodepleting All-11 cells (Fig. 2A, lane 1). Equivalent amounts of trichloroacetic acid-precipitated total or immunodepleted samples were loaded in each gel lane. 6-cm plates of tsA201 either sham-transfected (Fig. 2A, lane 4) or transfected with 4 μg of CN-HAcDNA (Fig. 2A, lane 3) were trichloroacetic acid-precipitated to determine the transient increase of CN-HA expression. All samples were separated using 7.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose for Western blot analysis. Blots were probed with anti-CN Ab (1:2000 dilution) and were developed by chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Band intensities were quantified by scanning 3–5 exposures to ensure the linearity of the band intensities using the Computing Densitometer and ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). 125I-Bgt Binding—To measure cell surface 125I-α-bungarotoxin (125I-Bgt) binding of transiently transfected cells were shifted from 37 to 20 °C, 24 h after the transfection. Cultures were grown for 4 days after transfection at 20 °C for maximal surface AChR expression. In contrast, cells stably expressing αβγδ receptor subunits were grown at 37 °C for 36 h and then shifted to 20 °C for 48 h. The cultures were then washed with PBS and incubated at room temperature in PBS containing 4 nm 125I-Bgt (140–170 cpm/fmol) for 2 h, which results in saturation of binding. Cultures were washed again in PBS, and the cell surface counts determined by γ-counting. Intracellular 125I-Bgt binding was measured by preincubating the cells in excess cold Bgt prior to solubilization (Fig. 2F). Appropriate Abs along with 10 nm 125I-Bgt were added to the cell lysates, incubated at 4 °C overnight to saturate binding at this lower temperature, followed by protein G-Sepharose purification. Sucrose Gradients—To compare the β- and βN1-subunits on the basis of their size, cell lysates, (labeled with [35S]Met/Cys) from cells transiently transfected with CN-HA alone or cotransfected with β or βN1 plus CN-HA, were layered on 5 ml of a 5–20% linear sucrose gradient prepared in the lysis buffer plus 0.1% LPC (Fig. 5). Gradients were centrifuged in a Beckman SW 50.1 rotor at 40,000 rpm for 10 h (ω2t = 1.53 × 1012). 300-μl fractions were collected from the top of the gradient (fraction 1) to the bottom (fraction 16). Under native, non-denatured conditions, proteins from each fraction were immunoprecipitated with a β-subunit-specific or anti-HA-specific Abs, precipitated by protein G-Sepharose and run on non-denaturing SDS-PAGE. Loss of N-glycosylation or Its Glucose Trimming Blocks AChR Assembly—We first examined how block of N-linked glycosylation or its glucose trimming affected AChR assembly. Mouse fibroblast L cells stably expressing the four Torpedo AChR subunits were treated with TUN or CAS. Torpedo AChR subunits were used because their assembly is temperature-sensitive (29Claudio T. Green W.N. Hartman D.S. Hayden D. Paulson H.L. Sigworth F.J. Sine S.M. Swedlund A. Science. 1987; 238: 1688-1694Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) allowing us to slow receptor assembly. Cells were treated with CAS or TUN starting 2 h before the temperature shift. CAS treatment decreased AChRs surface expression, as assayed with 125I-Bgt binding, by 75% (Fig. 1B), whereas TUN completely abolished it (Fig. 1A). In parallel, we measured 125I-Bgt binding to the total cellular pool of AChRs, which is a measure of the maturation of AChR subunits during their assembly in the ER (Fig. 1C). 48 h after the temperature shift CAS treatment caused a 74% decrease in cellular 125I-Bgt binding, similar to the CAS-induced decrease observed for cell surface 125I-Bgt binding. TUN completely abolished total cellular 125I-Bgt binding (data not shown). These data indicate that CAS and TUN treatment inhibit new AChR assembly because intracellular 125I-Bgt binding site formation occurs during AChR assembly in the ER. The effect of CAS on AChR expression was further characterized by pulse chase experiments in the presence or absence of 1 mm CAS (Fig. 1, D and E). Immediately following the pulse label of the subunits, CAS treatment had no effect on AChR subunit band intensities in Fig. 1D. Based on densitometry of the AChR subunit bands at the zero hour time point, the ratio of band intensities (CAS-treated to control) was 1.02 for α-subunits, 0.90 for β-subunits, and 0.99 for γ-subunits. From these findings we conclude that CAS treatment had little to no effect on AChR subunit synthesis. Subunit assembly was assayed by the amounts of β-, γ-, and δ-subunits that co-immunoprecipitated with α-subunits (Fig. 1D). Initially, subunit assembly was unaffected in CAS-treated cells. Again the band intensity ratios (CAS-treated to untreated) for the β-(0.90) and γ-(0.92) subunits that co-precipitated with α were not significantly changed. Little to no δ-subunit co-precipitated with α-subunits at the early chase times. The band that migrated at the same position as δ, labeled α′ in Fig. 1C, was previously shown to be different from the δ-subunit and appears to be an α-subunit dimer (27Green W.N. Claudio T. Cell. 1993; 74: 57-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). At the 48-h chase time, the band intensity ratios (CAS-treated to untreated) for co-precipitated β-, γ-, and δ-subunits were decreased. The ratios were reduced to 0.29 for β-subunits, 0.27 for γ-subunits, and 0.29 for δ-subunits, similar to the decreases in 125I-Bgt binding observed with CAS treatment (Fig. 1, B and C). Labeled subunits were also immunoprecipitated with mAb 247g, a mAb that only precipitates α-subunits after the formation of Bgt binding site when αβγδ tetramers assemble from αβγ trimers (Fig. 1E, Ref. 33Green W.N. Wanamaker C.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5555-5564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At the 3- and 6-h chase times in Fig. 1E, the intensity of the subunit bands in the precipitated αβγδ tetramers was reduced by 65–75% for the CAS-treated cells. Whereas CAS significantly reduced the relative amounts of the AChR subunits, CAS exposure did not alter the ratio of α:β:γ:δ at the 3- and 6-h chase times in Fig. 1E when mAb 247g precipitates αβγδ tetramers or at the 48-h chase time when mAb 247g precipitates α2βγδ pentamers (33Green W.N. Wanamaker C.P. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 5555-5564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whether or not CAS was present, we found a subunit ratio of 1:1:1:1 at the 3- and 6-h chase times and 2:1:1:1 at the 48-h chase time. Based on the results of Fig. 1, we conclude that CAS does not affect the early steps in AChR assembly when nascent subunits assemble into αβγ trimers. Instead, CAS is altering a later step in assembly after Bgt binding sites form and as αβγδ tetramers assemble. The effect of the CAS on the migration of the AChR subunits on SDS-PAGE is shown in the far right panel of Fig. 1D. In the presence of CAS, the change in subunit migration that occurs during assembly is totally blocked. This finding suggests that the change in migration is a measure of the glucose removal during trimming of subunit N-linked glycans. AChR Subunits Associate with CN—Because the chaperone CN behaves as a lectin, we tested whether CN is involved in the eff"
https://openalex.org/W2039291533,"We analysed the relationships between p53-induced apoptosis and the acidic fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) survival pathway. We found that p53 activation in rat embryonic fibroblasts induced the downregulation of FGF1 expression. These data suggest that the fgf1 gene is a repressed target of p53. Unlike extracellular FGF1, which has no effect on p53-dependent pathways, intracellular FGF1 inhibits both p53-dependent apoptosis and cell growth arrest via an intracrine pathway. FGF1 increases MDM2 expression at both mRNA and protein levels. This increase is associated with an acceleration of p53 degradation, which may partly account for the ability of endogenous FGF1 to counteract p53 pathways. In the presence of FGF1, p53 was unable to transactivate bax, but no modification of p21 gene transactivation was observed. As Bax is an essential component of the p53-dependent apoptosis pathway, this suggests that intracellular FGF1 inhibits p53 pathways not only by decreasing the stability of p53, but also by modifying some of its transactivation properties. In conclusion, we showed that p53 and FGF1 pathways may interact in the cell to determine cell fate. Deregulation of one of these pathways modifies the balance between cell proliferation and cell death and may lead to tumor progression."

https://openalex.org/W2038396450,"Recent studies claim a critical role for RUNX3 in gastric epithelial homeostasis. However, conflicting results exist regarding RUNX3 expression in the stomach and its potential role as a tumour-suppressor gene (TSG) in gastric carcinogenesis. Our aim was to evaluate the role of RUNX3 in early-onset gastric carcinomas (EOGCs). We analysed 41 EOGCs for RUNX3 aberrations using loss of heterozygosity (LOH), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analyses. LOH of markers flanking RUNX3 was relatively common, indicating that loss of the gene may play a role in gastric carcinogenesis. However, FISH analysis of selected cases and a panel of 14 gastric carcinoma-derived cell lines showed widespread presence of multiple copies of centromere 1. While RUNX3 copy numbers were generally equal to or fewer than those of centromere 1, at least two copies were present in almost all cells analysed. Accordingly, a subpopulation of tumour cells in 12/37 cases showed RUNX3 protein expression. However, expression was not detected in the adjacent nontumorous mucosa of any case. Together, these observations indicate that chromosome 1 aberrations occur frequently in EOGCs and are reflected in the LOH and IHC patterns found. Our findings refute a role for RUNX3 as a TSG in EOGCs."
https://openalex.org/W1973574504,"The p53 pathway is a central mediator of the apoptotic response. ASPP2/53BP2L (apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 2, also known as 53BP2L) enhances apoptosis through selective stimulation of p53 transactivation of proapoptotic target genes. Although the Rb/E2F pathway regulates ASPP2/53BP2L transcription, the complex mechanisms controlling ASPP2/53BP2L levels and function remain unknown. We now report that proteasomal degradation modulates ASPP2/53BP2L protein levels and apoptotic function. Treatment of cells with proteasomal inhibitors, including the clinically utilized proteasomal inhibitor bortezomib, increases ASPP2/53BP2L protein but not RNA levels. Likewise, anthracycline-based chemotherapy, which has multiple mechanisms of action, including proteasomal inhibition, increases ASPP2/53BP2L protein but not RNA levels. Proteasomal inhibition or anthracycline treatment increases ASPP2/53BP2L protein stability and half-life. Furthermore, the central region of the ASPP2/53BP2L protein is ubiquitinated as would be expected for a proteasomal substrate. More importantly, small interfering RNA knockdown of ASPP2/53BP2L levels attenuated bortezomib-induced apoptosis, and this effect was greater in wild-type p53 cells.

The p53 pathway is a central mediator of the apoptotic response (1Vousden K. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2738) Google Scholar).

However, the mechanisms defining the cellular context that favors apoptosis remain a highly regulated and incompletely understood process involving multiple pathways. TP53BP2, encoding ASPP2 (apoptosis-stimulating protein of p53 2), also referred to as 53BP2L (3Iwabuchi K. Bartel P.L. Li B. Marraccino R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Not surprisingly for such an important protein, control of ASPP2/53BP2L expression is complex and dependent on cellular context (9Lopez C.D. Ao Y. Rohde L. Perez T. O'Connor D. Lu X. Ford J. Naumovski L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8018-8025Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Indeed, ASPP2/53BP2L was shown recently to be cell cycle-regulated and a direct E2F transcriptional target gene, suggesting that it functions as a common link between the Rb/E2F and p53/p73 apoptotic pathways (12Chen D. Padiernos E. Ding F. Lossos I. Lopez C.D. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 358-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). However, several observations have also suggested that post-translational mechanisms may be important for controlling ASPP2/53BP2L levels as changes in the magnitude of ASPP2/53BP2L protein levels are not always reflected by similar changes in the magnitude of mRNA levels (9Lopez C.D.

Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 358-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Despite these observations, the mechanisms that participate in the post-translational regulation of ASPP2/53BP2L remain unknown. The 26 S proteasome is the major component of the ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation pathway required for regulating normal cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, signal transduction, stress responses, and apoptosis. More importantly, the proteasome is a therapeutic target in cancer therapy (13Rajkumar S. Richardson P. Hideshima T. Anderson K. J. Clin.

Bortezomib (VELCADE®, N-pyrazinecarbonyl-l-phenylalanine-l-leucine boronic acid; previously known as PS-341 or MLN-341) is a unique and specific inhibitor of the proteasome pathway that reversibly binds the 20 S proteasome complex and blocks its enzymatic activity (13Rajkumar S.

Consistent with its promising preclinical activity in cell culture and animal models, bortezomib demonstrated significant response rates in advanced multiple myeloma in a large, multicenter clinical trial and on this basis was the first proteasome inhibitor to be approved for clinical practice by the Food and Drug Administration (www/fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2003/NEW00905.html) (26Richardson P.

However, despite these findings, the molecular mechanisms underlying bortezomib activity remain incompletely understood. In this study, we present new evidence that proteasomal degradation modulates ASPP2/53BP2L protein levels and apoptotic function. These results demonstrate a previously undescribed mechanism that modulates the p53-ASPP2/53BP2L apoptotic pathway and provide new insight into the molecular pathways by which bortezomib may exert its therapeutic effects. Cell Culture and Drug Treatment—Cell lines and primary cells used in this study were as follows: HT1080, a wild-type p53 human fibrosarcoma-derived cell line (ATCC); GM38, normal human fibroblasts (Coriell); HEK293, a human embryonic kidney cell line (ATCC); HCT116p53+/+ and HCT116p53–/–, a matched isogenic pair of colorectal cancer cell lines with the p53 gene knocked out through homologous recombination (28Bunz F.

Science. 1998; 282: 1497-1501Crossref PubMed Scopus (2549) Google Scholar) (a gift from Dr. Bert Vogelstein, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD). All cells were maintained as described previously (9Lopez C.D. Ao Y. Rohde L. Perez T. O'Connor D. Lu X. Ford J. Naumovski L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8018-8025Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and were subconfluent at the time of drug treatment. Drugs were added to cells at the doses and times specified in the text and figure legends. Western and Northern Blotting—Western blotting was performed on total cell lysates after SDS-PAGE on 6–10% gels as described previously (8Ao Y. Rohde L.H. Naumovski L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2720-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 9Lopez C.D. Ao Y. Rohde L. Perez T. O'Connor D. Lu X. Ford J. Naumovski L. Mol. Cell.

The mouse monoclonal antibody DX547 (a gift from Dr. Xin Lu, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, London, UK) or the anti-53BP2 mouse monoclonal antibody (BD Biosciences) was used to detect ASPP2/53BP2L; p53 antibody was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. PARP 3The abbreviations used are: PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; siRNA, small interfering RNA; AMC, amino-4-methylcoumarin; Ub, ubiquitin. antibody was from Travigene. Tubulin (Sigma) or Hsc70 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) served as loading controls. Chemiluminescence imaging was performed using the SuperSignal West Dura substrate (Pierce). Images were captured to film, and bands were quantitated on x-ray film with a Bio-Rad scanning densitometer (GS-710) using Molecular Analyst software and normalized to the loading control signal detected after re-probing the membrane. Northern blotting was performed by isolating total RNA from cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen)/chloroform, resolved on a 1.5% formaldehyde-agarose gel, and hybridized with a 32P-labeled ASPP2/53BP2L cDNA probe as described previously (9Lopez C.D. Ao Y. Rohde L. Perez T. O'Connor D. Lu X. Ford J. Naumovski L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8018-8025Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Images were captured on a Bio-Rad PhosphorImager and normalized to an actin signal detected after stripping and re-probing the membrane. Protease Inhibitor and Ubiquitination Experiments—The protease inhibitors MG132, clasto-lactacystin β-lactone, and E64D were all dissolved in Me2SO and used at the indicated final concentrations. The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (formerly PS-341, Millenium Pharmaceuticals) was dissolved in Me2SO and used at the indicated final concentrations. For ASPP2/53BP2L ubiquitination experiments, the various ASPP2/53BP2L expression plasmids were co-transfected into HEK293 cells with the 6× polyhistidine-tagged human ubiquitin expression construct pMT107 (a gift from Dr. Dirk Bohmann, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY) (29Treir M. Staszewski L. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). Lysates were prepared in 1× extraction buffer with 6 m guanidinium 38 h after transfection, and polyhistidine-tagged proteins were isolated using immobilized metal affinity chromatography with TALON resin as per the manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). The various truncated ASPP2/53BP2L cDNA expression vectors were derived from the Cep4-ASPP2/53BP2L expression vector using standard molecular biologic techniques. For in vitro proteasomal inhibition assays, purified 20 S proteasomal subunit and Suc-LLVY-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) fluorogenic peptide substrate were from Calbiochem. 20 S activity was measured by monitoring the release of free AMC from the Suc-LLVY-AMC peptide by changes in fluorescence over time, with or without preincubation with doxorubicin (excitation maximum, 380 nm; emission maximum, 460 nm). Protein Half-life Determination—Exponentially growing cells were treated with cycloheximide at a final concentration of 100 μg/ml. Whole cell lysates were prepared at the various time points after cycloheximide addition (time 0), and quantitative ASPP2/53BP2L immunoblotting was performed on equivalent amounts of total protein. For ASPP2/53BP2L protein half-life determination after proteasomal inhibition or doxorubicin treatment, cells were first pretreated with bortezomib (125 nm final concentration) or doxorubicin (250 ng/ml final concentration) for 2 h prior to cycloheximide addition, and cells lysates were similarly prepared for immunoblotting at the various time points after cycloheximide addition (time 0). Quantitation for the ASPP2/53BP2L protein half-life experiments was performed using a LI-COR Infrared Odyssey Imaging system. After transfer, the polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was blocked for 2 h with 1× LI-COR blocking buffer. The membrane was then cut in half for detection of ASPP2/53BP2L and tubulin with the respective primary antibodies. Secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor®680 goat anti-mouse IgG (Molecular Probes) at 1:5000 dilution for detection of ASPP2/53BP2L and IRDye™ 800CW Conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Rockland Inc.) at 1:15,000 dilution for detection of tubulin. Images were captured and quantitated using Odyssey software (version 1.2). Apoptosis Assays—At the indicated times after bortezomib treatment, attached and floating cells were collected by centrifugation at 3000 × g for 10 min, washed two times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in Annexin V Binding Buffer (BD Biosciences) at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells per ml. Allophycocyanin-conjugated annexin V was immediately added at a 1:20 dilution, incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark, diluted 1:5 in Annexin V Binding Buffer, and then analyzed on a FACScan (BD Biosciences) as described previously (12Chen D. Padiernos E. Ding F. Lossos I. Lopez C.D. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 358-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Annexin V-allophycocyanin base-line staining was determined on untreated cells (M1 gate). Annexin V-allophycocyanin staining of apoptotic cells was defined by the shifted peak absorbance (M2 gate) compared with base line per standard convention by flow cytometry. Percentage of apoptotic cells was expressed as M2/(M1 + M2). Detection of a DNA ladder from apoptotic cells was performed as described previously (8Ao Y. Rohde L.H. Naumovski L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2720-2725Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). ASPP2/53BP2L siRNA—1 × 105 cells were plated into 6-well plates and transfected with 0.25 nm final concentration of ASPP2/53BP2L-specific, or scrambled control, high pressure liquid chromatography-purified siRNA (Qiagen) using the TransIT-TKO transfection reagent optimized per the manufacturer's recommendations (Mirus, Madison, WI). Cells were then incubated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum for 16 h and then used for the bortezomib apoptosis experiments. The following sequences were used: ASPP2/53BP2L siRNA 1 target sequence, 5′-TATGCAGAGACGTGGTGGA-3′; ASPP2/53BP2L siRNA 2 target sequence, 5′-AAGTTGCTGAGCAGGAGAAAC-3′; and scramble control siRNA sequence, 5′-AATTCTCCGAACGTGTCACGT-3′. Post-transcriptional Control of ASPP2/53BP2L Expression—Although ASPP2/53BP2L is transcriptionally regulated by E2F (12Chen D. Padiernos E. Ding F. Lossos I. Lopez C.D. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 358-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), several observations suggest that post-transcriptional mechanisms may be important for controlling ASPP2/53BP2L expression (9Lopez C.D.

Because post-translational mechanisms lead to an increase in p53 protein levels after DNA-damaging chemotherapy and ASPP2/53BP2L protein interacts with p53 to promote damage-induced apoptosis (4Samuels-Lev Y.

Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 865-871Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we wondered if ASPP2/53BP2L protein levels would increase after chemotherapy treatment and whether post-translational mechanisms were involved. We treated wt-p53 human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells with increasing concentrations of the anthracycline chemotherapeutic agent doxorubicin. Cultures were harvested 24 h after the addition of doxorubicin, at which time the viability was >95% at all doses ranges, and quantitative Western blots were performed on equivalent amounts of total protein lysates with anti-ASPP2/53BP2L and anti-p53 antibodies (Fig. 1A). ASPP2/53BP2L protein levels increased at doxorubicin doses of 25 and 50 ng/ml by a factor of 3.1 and 6.4, respectively, relative to nontreated cells, although at higher doses this was less evident (Fig. 1A, top panel). As expected, p53 protein levels also increased but, unlike ASPP2/53BP2L, continued to increase even at 250 ng/ml (Fig. 1A, middle panel). We also treated HT1080 cells with increasing concentrations of the anthracycline chemotherapy agent idarubicin and found at least a 4.7-fold increase in ASPP2/53BP2L protein levels at 24 h, although at higher doses this was not seen (Fig. 1B, top panel). As expected, levels of p53 protein also increased with idarubicin similar to doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 1B, middle panel). To determine whether this also occurred in nontumor-derived cells, we treated normal human diploid fibroblast GM38 cells with doxorubicin and found a nearly 3-fold increase in ASPP2/53BP2L protein levels within 90 min. Levels of p53 increased over 10-fold by 3.5 h of doxorubicin treatment (Fig. 1C). To determine whether post-transcriptional control was involved in the increase in ASPP2/53BP2L protein levels, HT1080 cells were treated with doxorubicin, and ASPP2/53BP2L mRNA and protein levels were measured in treated and control cells. We found that ASPP2/53BP2L mRNA levels did not increase after doxorubicin treatment of cells, even though ASPP2/53BP2L protein levels increased 4-fold in the same cells (Fig. 1D). Consistent with these results, doxorubicin could not activate an ASPP2/53BP2L promoter-luciferase reporter (12Chen D. Padiernos E. Ding F. Lossos I. Lopez C.D. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 358-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) transfected into a variety of cell types (data not shown). These results suggest that a post-transcriptional process participates in modulating ASPP2/53BP2L protein levels. Post-translational Control of ASPP2/53BP2L Protein Levels Is Modulated through the Proteasome—Doxorubicin has many mechanisms of action, including intercalation into DNA and free radical generation, as well as direct binding and inhibition of the proteasome (31Kiyomiya K. Kurebe M. Nakagawa H. Matsuo S. Int. J. Oncol. 2002; 20: 1205-1209PubMed Google Scholar, 32Kiyomiya K. Satoh J. Horie H. Kurebe M. Nakagawa H. Matsuo S. Int. J. Oncol. 2002; 21: 1081-1085PubMed Google Scholar). Given that doxorubicin increases ASPP2/53BP2L protein levels but not ASPP2/53BP2L mRNA levels (Fig. 1), and that p53 protein levels are controlled by proteasomal degradation, we wondered if specific inhibition of the proteasome would result in elevated ASPP2/53BP2L protein levels. Therefore, we treated GM38 cells with protease inhibitors, including changes in specific proteasome inhibitors, and we ASPP2/53BP2L protein levels. ASPP2/53BP2L measured protein levels increased over 13-fold after treating cells with the proteasome inhibitors MG132 or clasto-lactacystin β-lactone, compared with control vehicle Me2SO-treated cells (Fig. 2A). In contrast, ASPP2/53BP2L protein levels did not increase significantly in cells treated with the calpain inhibitor (E64D) (Fig. 2A). HT1080 cells showed a similar increase in ASPP2/53BP2L protein levels after proteasome inhibition with MG132 (Fig. 2B). To determine whether treatment with the clinically utilized proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (13Rajkumar S. Richardson P. Hideshima T. Anderson K. J. Clin. Oncol. 2005; 23: 630-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar) also resulted in an increase in ASPP2/53BP2L protein, we treated HT1080, GM38, and HEK293 cells with increasing amounts of bortezomib (Fig. 2, C–E). We found that ASPP2/53BP2L protein levels increased from up to 16–32.5-fold in the three different cell lines treated with bortezomib. ASPP2/53BP2L mRNA levels were not changed after bortezomib treatment in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2E, lower panels) nor with other proteasomal inhibitors and in different cell lines (data not shown). To confirm further that proteasomal degradation modulates ASPP2/53BP2L protein stability, we measured the half-life of ASPP2/53BP2L protein in cells treated with bortezomib, as well as with doxorubicin, compared with untreated cells (Fig. 3). In the absence of bortezomib or doxorubicin treatment, the half-life of ASPP2/53BP2L protein was ∼60–80 min (Fig. 3A). However, pretreatment of cells with bortezomib or doxorubicin inhibited ASPP2/53BP2L protein turnover. Similar inhibition of ASPP2/53BP2L protein turnover was seen with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (data not shown). Together, our data suggest that ASPP2/53BP2L protein is degraded by the proteasome and that proteasomal inhibition specifically increases ASPP2/53BP2L levels. Ubiquitination of ASPP2/53BP2L—Proteins degraded by the proteasome are typically ubiquitinated prior to degradation as has been shown for p53, Myc, Jun, and many other proteins (29Treir M. Staszewski L. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar, 30Oren M. Damalas A. Gottlieb T. Michael D. Taplick J. Leal J. Maya R. Moas M. Seger R.

Because proteasomal degradation appears to control ASPP2/53BP2L protein levels (Figs. 2 and 3), we reasoned that ASPP2/53BP2L would be ubiquitinated. To examine this, we co-transfected cells with an ASPP2/53BP2L expression plasmid and an expression plasmid encoding a polyhistidine-tagged ubiquitin (His-Ub) (29Treir M. Staszewski L. Bohmann D. Cell. 1994; 78: 787-798Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). His-Ub and His-Ub-tagged proteins were isolated by binding to a nickel affinity resin. Western blotting of total cell lysates and His-Ub-tagged proteins with an anti-ASPP2/53BP2L antibody showed that ASPP2/53BP2L was ubiquitinated when it was co-expressed with His-Ub (Fig. 4A, 4th lane). In contrast, transfection of ASPP2/53BP2L expression plasmid alone did not result in ubiquitination of ASPP2/53BP2L protein (Fig. 4A, 2nd lane). Deletion derivatives of ASPP2/53BP2L lacking the amino-terminal 129 amino acids (ΔN-ASPP2), or lacking both the amino-terminal 129 amino acids and carboxyl-terminal 240 amino acids (ΔN-ASPP2-ΔC), could still be ubiquitinated (Fig. 4B). However, neither the carboxyl-terminal 286 amino acids of ASPP2/53BP2L (containing the ANK and SH3 domains that interact with p53) nor an amino-terminal region (containing α-helical structure) could be ubiquitinated (Fig. 4C, ASPP2/53BP2L fragments A and B, respectively). As a specificity control, neither green fluorescent protein (GFP) nor a GFP elongation factor-1α fusion protein was ubiquitinated (Fig. 4D). A schematic diagram summarizing the results is shown (Fig. 4E). Together with our data showing that ASPP2/53BP2L protein levels are modulated by proteasomal degradation, these results demonstrating that ASPP2/53BP2L can be ubiquitinated suggest that ASPP2/53BP2L is a direct substrate of the proteasome. ASPP2/53BP2L Mediates Proteasomal Inhibition-induced Apoptosis—Proteasomal inhibitors can induce apoptosis through multiple mechanisms including p53 activation, although the precise contribution of the p53 pathway is not clear (13Rajkumar S.

ASPP2/53BP2L has been shown to enhance apoptosis at least in part by stimulating p53 (as well as p73/p63) transactivation of proapoptotic target genes (10Bergamaschi D. Samuels-Lev Y. Jin B. Duraaisingham S. Crook T. Lu X. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1341-1350Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Because ASPP2/53BP2L protein levels appear controlled by the proteasome (Figs. 2, 3, 4), we wondered if ASPP2/53BP2L could mediate proteasomal inhibitor-induced apoptosis and whether this was influenced by an intact p53 pathway. To examine this, we utilized siRNAs to attenuate ASPP2/53BP2L expression in isogenic human HCT116 colorectal cancer cell lines differing only in p53 sta"

Based on the Lpd structure and sequence alignment between bacterial and eukaryotic Lpd sequences, we generated single point mutations in Lpd and assayed the resulting proteins for their ability to catalyze lipoamide reduction/oxidation alone and in complex with other proteins that participate in pyruvate dehydrogenase and peroxidase activities. The results suggest that amino acid residues conserved in mycobacterial species but not conserved in eukaryotic Lpd family members modulate either or both activities and include Arg-93, His-98, Lys-103, and His-386. In addition, Arg-93 and His-386 are involved in forming both “open” and “closed” active site conformations, suggesting that these residues play a role in dynamically regulating Lpd function. Taken together, these data suggest protein surfaces that should be considered while developing strategies for inhibiting this enzyme.

Over the last decade, tuberculosis has reemerged as one of the leading causes of death (1Bloom B.R. Murray C.J.L. Science. 1992; 257: 1055-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (1243) Google Scholar). Despite the substantive response of the host immune system that includes both oxidative and nitrosative stress, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) 2The abbreviations used are: Mtb, Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Lpd, lipoamide dehydrogenase; DlaT, dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase; PDH, pyruvate dehydrogenase; E1, AceE component of the PDH complex; E2, DlaT component of the PDH complex; E3, Lpd component of the PDH complex; MPD, 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol; LDH, lipoamide dehydrogenase; DTNB, dithionitrobenzene. evades these insults, in part by adopting metabolic enzymes to catabolize these toxic compounds (2Nathan C. Shiloh M.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8841-8848Crossref PubMed Scopus (1158) Google Scholar). Lipoamide dehydrogenase (Lpd), dihydrolipoamide acyltransferase (DlaT; formerly termed succinyl transferase), an alkylhydroperoxidase termed AhpC, and the protein (AhpD) encoded by an adjacent gene, have been shown to take part in this defense pathway (3Bryk R. Lima C.D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Nathan C. Science. 2002; 295: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 4Koshkin A. Knudsen G.M. Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2004; 427: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). All of these enzymes are oxidoreductases, and each contains redox centers that reduce or oxidize adjacent partners in the pathway. The Lpd redox center consists of two conserved cysteine residues and a non-covalently bound FAD molecule (5Hopkins N. Williams C.H. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 11757-11765Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). DlaT, encoded by the gene Rv2215, was originally annotated as the E2 component of α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, but subsequent investigation revealed that Mtb lacks α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. Rv2215 instead encodes DlaT, the E2 component of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) (6Tian J. Bryk R. Shi S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Nathan C. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). DlaT contains a redox center in the form of dihydrolipoyl cofactors that are covalently attached to lysine ϵ-amino groups within lipoyl domains that form the so-called “swinging arms” of this enzyme (7Perham R.N. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2000; 69: 961-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar). Both AhpD and AhpC contain redox centers consisting of two conserved cysteine residues (3Bryk R. Lima C.D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Nathan C. Science. 2002; 295: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Each of these redox centers can oxidize or reduce the redox center of the adjacent enzyme in the cascade. For example, AhpC metabolizes peroxides and peroxynitrite (ROI/RNI) (3Bryk R. Lima C.D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Nathan C. Science. 2002; 295: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 8Bryk R. Griffin P. Nathan C.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 568: 146-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), AhpD regenerates the redox center of AhpC, DlaT regenerates the redox center of AhpD, and Lpd regenerates the redox center of DlaT. Lpd serves a critical function in this cascade because its redox center is regenerated directly by NADH. The process can be represented as a flow of electrons from NADH → Lpd → DlaT → AhpD → AhpC → ROOH. The absence or perturbation of any member in this cascade has been shown to negatively impact the electron flow (3Bryk R. Lima C.D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Nathan C. Science. 2002; 295: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar), 3S. Shi and S. Ehrt, submitted for publication. thus making this pathway an attractive target for therapeutic intervention against Mtb. Such intervention might render the organism more susceptible to the oxidative and nitrosative stress imposed by the host immune system, as demonstrated for Mtb in which dlaT has been disrupted. 3S. Shi and S. Ehrt, submitted for publication. The inhibition of Lpd might also have adverse effects on Mtb unrelated to the defense of Mtb against the host immune response. Lpd and DlaT are both components of the multienzyme PDH complex (6Tian J. Bryk R. Shi S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Nathan C. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Lpd constitutes the E3 component of PDH, catalyzing the NAD+-dependent oxidation of the dihydrolipoyl cofactor that is covalently linked to the lipoyl domains of DlaT, the E2 component. Lpd, DlaT, and AceE, the E1 component of PDH (6Tian J. Bryk R. Shi S. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Nathan C. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 859-868Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), synthesize acetyl-CoA, a component of the Krebs cycle critical for the generation of precursors for energetic and/or biosynthetic functions. These pathways are essential and conserved across evolution. Lpd belongs to the group I flavoprotein disulfide reductase protein family (11Argyrou A. Blanchard J.S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 2004; 78: 89-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Members of the flavoprotein disulfide reductase family share low sequence identity (25–35%), and although the structure of Lpd from Mtb was not known, significant structural information is known for other group I flavoprotein disulfide reductase proteins whose three-dimensional structures are comparable with root mean square deviations of less than 2 Å over nearly 400 Cα atoms. The structure of human Lpd has also been recently reported (12Brautigam C.A. Chuang J.L. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Chuang D.T. J. Mol.

Purification of Mycobacterium tuberculosis Lpd—The gene lpdC (Rv0462)-(1–464) was cloned as described previously (3Bryk R. Lima C.D. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Nathan C. Science. 2002; 295: 1073-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). To facilitate purification, lpdC was amplified by PCR, cloned, expressed, and purified from Escherichia coli as a N-terminal His6-Smt3 fusion protein (21Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 5: 865-876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The pET-based plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) CodonPlus RIL (Stratagene). A 5-liter culture was grown by fermentation at 37 °C to an A600 of 2, adjusted to 30 °C and 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and incubated for 4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 350 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 20% sucrose, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 μg/ml lysozyme and sonicated. After the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation, His6-Smt3-Lpd was purified by metal-affinity and gel filtration chromatography (Superdex200). The His-Smt3 tag was removed by the Smt3-specific protease Ulp1 and Lpd was further purified by gel filtration (Superdex200). Lpd eluted from gel filtration at a position consistent with dimer formation. Lpd was concentrated to 8 mg/ml, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. Crystallographic Analysis—Crystals of Lpd were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 6 °C. The drop contained 2 μl of protein (4 mg/ml) and 2 μl of reservoir solution (50% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD)). Crystals grew over 8–10 days in a final crystallization condition that included 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 50% MPD. Crystals were flash-frozen in the solution in which they grew using liquid nitrogen. Lpd crystals were obtained from protein containing selenomethionine (22Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. LeMaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1005) Google Scholar) and used for the structure determination by single wavelength anomalous diffraction analysis. Lpd crystals belong to orthorhombic space group P212121 with a = 83.59, b = 96.67, c = 122.89 Å. X-ray diffraction data were collected at NSLS beamline X9A at wavelength 0.979 Å. Data were reduced with DENZO, SCALEPACK (23Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38572) Google Scholar), and CCP4 (24Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19769) Google Scholar). The structure of Lpd was determined using single wavelength anomalous diffraction technique employing the anomalous signal from selenium atoms as implemented in the software SOLVE (25Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3220) Google Scholar). Twelve selenium atoms were located, and phases derived from these anomalous centers were used for density modification as implemented in the software RESOLVE (26Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). Non-crystallographic symmetry was used for further phase improvement. Manual model building was accomplished using O (27Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar).

Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). Water molecules were located and refined. The final model contains 6938 protein atoms, 106 cofactor atoms (FAD), one MPD molecule (8 atoms), and 333 solvent atoms and was refined to an R value of 19.9% and an Rfree value of 24.6%.

Complementary sets of oligonucleotide primers of length 23–39 containing respective codon substitutions were obtained from Invitrogen. Plasmid DNA containing the Lpd mutations were extracted from a culture grown from a single colony of transformed XL1-Blue cells. All mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Expression strains containing each mutation were used to obtain mutant proteins as described above using a 1-liter culture of E. coli. Cells were harvested and lysed using BugBuster HT (Novogen). The insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant containing His6-Smt3-Lpd was mixed with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen), incubated for 30 min, and washed five times with 1 volume of wash buffer (500 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris (pH 8) 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 10 mm imidazole). The resin was resuspended in 5 ml containing 20 mm triethanolamine (pH 7.8). Lpd was cleaved from the His6-Smt3 tag using Smt3-specific protease Ulp1 (21Mossessova E. Lima C.D. Mol.

Protein concentration was assessed, and the material was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C for later use. Biochemical Assays—Enzymatic activities of wild-type and mutant Lpd proteins were assessed by three different assays: 1) a lipoamide dehydrogenase (LDH) assay, in which Lpd proteins were tested alone for their ability to catalyze lipoamide reduction; 2) a PDH assay, in which Lpd proteins were tested in complex with AceE (E1 component of PDH) and DlaT (E2 component of PDH) recombinant proteins for pyruvate- and CoA-dependent NADH production; 3) and a dithionitrobenzene (DTNB) assay, in which Lpd proteins were tested in complex with DlaT and AhpD recombinant proteins for NADH-dependent DTNB reduction. All assays were done in triplicate in 96-well plates using a SpectraMAX 340PC plate reader (Molecular Devices) at room temperature. LDH assay reaction mixtures (0.2 ml) contained 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 100 μm NADH, 40 μm NAD+, 2.5 mm lipoamide, and 50 nm Lpd protein. Assays were initiated by adding reaction mixtures to protein dispensed into wells and monitored at 340 nm. Lipoamide was prepared as 50 mm stock in methanol. PDH assay reaction mixture (0.2 ml) contained 50 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 1 mm NAD+, 200 μm thiamine pyrophosphate, 1 mm MgCl2, 170 μm CoA, 1 mm pyruvate, 200 nm Lpd, 350 nm DlaT, and 200 nm AceE. Assays were initiated by adding reaction mixtures to proteins dispensed into wells and monitored at 340 nm. DTNB assay reaction mixture (0.1 ml) contained 100 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.0), 2 mm EDTA, 100 μm NADH, 75 μm DTNB, 100 nm Lpd, 175 nm DlaT, and 18 nm AhpD. Assays were initiated by adding reaction mixtures to proteins dispensed into wells and monitored at 405 nm for thionitrobenzene production. The overall structure of the Mtb Lpd protomer is similar to other known group I flavoprotein disulfide reductase proteins (Fig. 1) (11Argyrou A. Blanchard J.S. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 52694-52702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) with sequence identities ranging between 25 and 35%. Despite low sequence identity, the three-dimensional structures align well with root mean square differences of less than 1.75 Å over ∼400 Cα atoms. As expected from previous structures, Mtb Lpd is a dimer and similar in overall organization to lipoamide dehydrogenase structures from other organisms. The Lpd fold consists of an N-terminal FAD-binding domain (residues 1–47 and residues 105–144), a NADH-binding domain (residues 145–268), a central domain (residues 269–343), and two segments of the structure that mediate dimer formation (residues 48–104 and 344–464) (Fig. 1). The Lpd dimer is formed via extensive interactions between protomers that buries a total surface area of ∼3600 Å2 for each protomer. Each protomer includes a non-covalently bound FAD molecule. FAD was co-purified from E. coli lysate, as it was not added during purification of the recombinant protein. NADH was not observed bound within our structure, although a clear NADH binding pocket was apparent on the surface of the protein where NADH has been observed to bind previously (12Brautigam C.A.

Proteins. 1992; 13: 336-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Mtb Lpd crystallizes as the biological dimer in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, and although the protomer structures appear similar, there were small but important structural differences observed when comparing the two protomers (see below). The two Lpd active sites are formed by interfacial residues between protomers (Fig. 1). The primary constituents of the active site include a disulfide-based redox center (Cys-41 and Cys-46). These residues are located proximal to the non-covalently bound FAD and a His-Glu pair (His-443, Glu-448) that has been postulated as a general acid for catalysis (Fig. 1B) (33Benen J. van Berkel W. Dieteren N. Arscott D. Williams Jr., C. Veeger C. de Kok A. Eur J Biochem. 1992; 207: 487-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Cys-41 and Cys-46 were observed as an oxidized disulfide. The redox center is accessed through a channel ∼15 Å deep and is encompassed by residues that include Pro-13, Tyr-16, Leu-42, Ile-47, Arg-93, Gly-96, Phe-99, Leu-100, Glu-321, Ala-383′, His-443′, Asn-463′, and Phe-464′ (apostrophes indicate residues from the second protomer). This channel is likely utilized in interactions with the lipoylated side chain from DlaT. Most active site residues were observed in nearly identical conformations in both promoter structures; however, one considerable difference was noted. In one active site, Arg-93 was observed interacting with an MPD molecule in a conformation that would block access to the deep channel. In the other active site, Arg-93 interacts with His-386 in an open conformation that would permit full access into the active site and redox center. Both Arg-93 and His-386 are conserved among mycobacterial Lpd family members but not conserved among other eukaryotic family members (see below) (Fig. 2A). To establish the functional basis for these and other differences observed in the structure, we selected several candidate residues for mutational analysis based on the Lpd structure and sequence alignments of representative family members from both bacterial and eukaryotic organisms. The goals for the mutagenesis and functional analysis were to identify residues essential for catalysis that were conserved among mycobacteria but not conserved in eukaryotic Lpd family members. We reasoned that if surfaces could be identified that were essential for Mtb Lpd function, they might be exploited for therapeutic intervention. Based on the amino acid sequence alignment of Lpd sequences from M. tuberculosis (Mtb, accession P66004), Mycobacterium leprae (Mle) (Q50068), pig (P09623), human (P09622), dog (P49819), and mouse (O08749), we selected several single point mutations based on their location around the Lpd active site and on surfaces postulated to be involved in interaction with the lipoylated DlaT domain (Fig. 2). These mutations were placed into two classes. Class I included residues conserved in prokaryotic sequences (Mtb and Mle) but not conserved between prokaryotic and eukaryotic sequences (human, pig, dog, and mouse). Class II residues were conserved in all five sequences listed above. Using these criteria, 20 candidate residues were selected for mutation. In addition to these residues, we also selected several lysine residues for mutagenesis (Lys-216, Lys-220, Lys-223, and Lys-224), because they formed a cluster on surface that we speculated might interact with the lipoylated domain of DlaT (Fig. 3A). Although 29 mutants were constructed, only 23 produced suitable protein for biochemical analysis. Wild-type and mutant Lpd proteins were evaluated in three different assays; (a) the LDH assay evaluated whether mutants were effective in binding lipoamide and reducing it to dihydrolipoamide, (b) the PDH assay evaluated the ability of mutant Lpd proteins to oxidize dihydrolipoamide on the swinging arms of DlaT in complex with E1 (AceE) and E2 (DlaT) components of PDH complex, and (c) the DTNB assay evaluated the ability of mutant Lpd proteins to reduce lipoamide on the swinging arms of DlaT and then supply electrons to AhpD. Results of these assays are presented in TABLE TWO and graphically in Fig. 3. Of the 23 mutants assayed, 9 were observed to have significantly diminished activity when compared with wild-type, whereas 14 had negligible defects in activity.TABLE TWOMutations, class, and activity profiles Mutations are represented by single letter code, residue position, and single letter code for the corresponding mutant amino acid residue.

These residues included Asp-5, Asn-43, and Phe-464 (TABLE TWO). Asp-5 is located far from the active site and is not thought to directly participate in catalysis. As such, it remains unclear why alanine substitution at this position would preclude activity in the LDH assay, although it might play an indirect role in coordinating either FAD or NADH. Asn-43 is located between the two active site cysteine residues and is likely important for positioning this critical region of the protein for productive catalysis. It may also play a role in positioning the helix that coordinates FAD. Phe-464 is the most C-terminal amino acid. It is positioned at the periphery of the deep channel that is thought to participate in binding or coordinating the lipoylated side chain from DlaT. Substitution of this position to alanine completely abrogates activity in all three assays. Of the mutations made within class I residues (conserved in Mtb, but not conserved with eukaryotic Lpd family members), only four gave rise to defects greater than 50% in any of the three assays and included mutation at Arg-93, His-98, Lys-103, and His-386 (TABLE TWO; Figs. 2 and 3). Lys-103 is proximal to Phe-464 (see above), and glutamate substitution at this position would be predicted to disrupt its interaction with the Phe-464 C terminus. Lys-103 is conserved as a glutamine in other eukaryotic Lpd family members (Fig. 2). His-98 is conserved as alanine in other eukaryotic Lpd family members. His-98 substitution to alanine in Mtb Lpd diminishes its activity to only 33% in the LDH assay, but preserved over 60% activity in both PDH and DTNB assays. His-98 is located within the helix and nearby a conserved glycine that forms one side of the deep channel leading to the active site. It is also observed within hydrogen bonding distance to Glu-108. Position 108 is conserved as either Arg or His in other eukaryotic family members, suggesting that the interaction between His-98 and Glu-108 is specific to mycobacterial Lpd family members. Perhaps the most interesting class I mutations were at positions 93 and 386, as these two residues interact in the Mtb Lpd structure (Fig. 4). Arg-93 is conserved as leucine in eukaryotic family members. Alanine substitution at position 93 abolishes LDH activity but results in 40 or 80% activity in PDH or DTNB assays, respectively. Not surprisingly, charge reversal at position 93 completely abrogates activity in all three of the assays. Although position 386 is conserved as lysine in eukaryotic Lpd family members, substitution of His386 with either lysine or alanine resulted in diminished activities in the three assays that were tested. As stated in previous sections, Arg-93 was observed in two distinct conformations in each of the two Lpd active sites (Fig. 4). In one active site, Arg-93 is stacked above His-386′ across the dimer interface (Fig. 4B). In this “open” conformation, the deep channel is fully accessible to solvent and to the presumed interaction with dihydrolipoamide. In the “closed” configuration, Arg-93 is positioned in the channel such that the access is partially blocked by the arginine side chain (Fig. 4B). A single molecule of MPD was observed in the channel interacting with Arg-93, a molecule present in our crystallization condition (see “Experimental Procedures”). Although MPD binding in the active site is likely a crystallization artifact, it is interesting for several reasons. The first is that alanine substitution at Arg-93 abrogates LDH activity but only exhibits diminished activity in PDH or DTNB assays, suggesting that defects resulting from diminished dihydrolipoamide interaction can be overcome when the lipoyl group is presented by DlaT. This suggests that Arg-93 may interact directly with dihydrolipoamide in these assays. Although MPD and lipoamide are structurally distinct, they do share some common functionality that could be exploited when trying to understand how lipoamide may interact with the Lpd active site. At the very least, it can be speculated that if small molecules could be engineered to interact with the pocket and Arg-93 with high affinity, they might lock the channel in a closed conformation as observed in our structure. This approach might lead to specific inhibition of the Mtb enzyme insomuch as position 93 is conserved as a leucine residue in human and other eukaryotic sequences and analysis of the human Lpd structure suggests that leucine could not occupy the position observed for Mtb Lpd Arg-93 in the “closed” conformation.

In new studies, ZPI inhibited FIXa in the FXase complex. Since this observation could merely represent inhibition of the FXa product whose activity was measured, inhibition of FIXa was investigated five ways. 1) FXase incubation mixtures with/without ZPI/protein Z were diluted in EDTA; FXa activity was measured after reversal of its inhibition. 2) FXase incubation mixtures were immunoblotted for FXa product. 3) FX activation peptide region was 3H-labeled; release of 3H was used to measure FXase activity. 4) Activity was monitored in a FIXa-based clotting assay. 5) FIXa amidolytic activity was measured. In all cases, FIXa was inhibited by subphysiologic levels of ZPI. Unlike inhibition of FXa, inhibition of FIXa did not strictly require protein Z. Low concentrations of FVIIIa increased the efficiency of ZPI inhibition of FIXa; FVIIIa in molar excess was not protective of FIXa unless FIXa/FVIIIa interacted prior to ZPI exposure. Unusual time courses were observed for inhibition of both FIXa in the FXase complex and FXa in the prothrombinase complex. Activity loss stabilized in <100 s at a level dependent on ZPI concentration, suggesting equilibrium interactions rather than typical covalent serpin-protease interactions. Surface plasmon resonance binding experiments revealed binding and dissociation of ZPI/FIXa with Kdapp of 9-12 nm, similar to the concentration of ZPI needed for 50% inhibition.

ZPI is estimated to be present at 3.8 μg/ml (53 nm) in plasma, forms non-covalent complexes with protein Z in plasma, and has an apparent mobility of 72 kDa on SDS-PAGE (3Han X. Fiehler R.

It has an unusual P1 residue of Tyr-387, and the mutant Y387A did not inhibit FXa (2Han X. Huang Z.F. Fiehler R. Broze Jr., G.J.

Besides inhibiting FXa, ZPI inhibits FXIa (EC 3.4.21.27) in a reaction stimulated 2-fold by heparin and not requiring protein Z (3Han X. Fiehler R. Broze Jr., G.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 3049-3055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, mutations in ZPI that generate stop codons at residues Arg-67 or Trp-303 were found to be significantly associated with venous thrombosis (6Water N. Tan T. Ashton F. O'Grady A. Day T. Browett P. Ockelford P. Harper P. Br. J. Haematol. 2004; 127: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), although a different study found no association between ZPI or protein Z levels and venous thrombosis (7Al-Shanqeeti A. van Hylckama Vlieg A.

Protein Z is a 62-kDa vitamin K-dependent plasma protein that circulates almost entirely as a complex with protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor and has a wide range in plasma of 2.6 ± 1 μg/ml (4Tabatabai A.

The cofactor role of protein Z in FXa inhibition by ZPI is the first clearly identified function for human protein Z, although bovine and not human protein Z enhances the binding of thrombin to membrane surfaces (9Hogg P.J. Stenflo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10953-10958Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein Z gene knock-out mice have no gross abnormalities, but thrombotic manifestations are exacerbated in an FV Leiden pedigree (10Yin Z.F. Huang Z.F. Cui J. Fiehler R. Lasky N. Ginsburg D.

For humans with FV Leiden, low protein Z is associated with an earlier age of first thrombosis and more frequent thrombotic events (11Kemkes-Matthes B. Matthes K.J. Semin. Thromb.

Low protein Z is associated with anti-protein Z antibodies and unexplained early fetal loss, which could involve thrombosis (20Gris J.C. Quere I. Dechaud H. Mercier E. Pincon C. Hoffet M. Vasse M.

Martinuzzo M.E. Lu L. Broze G.J. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 1764-1770Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Although ZPI was reported in preliminary studies not to inhibit FIXa (3Han X. Fiehler R. Broze Jr., G.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 3049-3055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (EC 3.4.21.22), we investigated whether ZPI might inhibit FIXa in the FXase complex, as well as FXa in the prothrombinase complex. If so, we wondered whether FVIIIa might protect FIXa from ZPI inhibition, as FVa protects FXa from ZPI inhibition, and whether protein Z might be required for inhibition of FIXa. The homologous prothrombinase and FXase complexes work in tandem to generate thrombin (EC 3.4.21.5), and a physiologic inhibitor of both complexes could be particularly significant. Plasma-derived Proteins and Reagents—ZPI was purified from plasma as described (1Han X. Fiehler R. Broze Jr., G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The anti-FIX was purified by 35% saturated ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by dialysis and Hi-load Q Sepharose chromatography. CM5 chips for surface plasmon resonance binding studies were from Biacore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ. Recombinant ZPI—Due to the modest concentration of ZPI in plasma and the large number of purification steps required, recombinant (r) ZPI was prepared. A 1.4-kb cDNA was cloned from human liver cDNA from two individuals using 5′ primers beginning at the signal peptide sequence and 3′ primers extending beyond the stop codon and a high fidelity proofreading DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) in a polymerase chain reaction. The product was introduced into the vector pcDNA3.1 Topo (Invitrogen) to transform competent Escherichia coli cells. DNA was prepared from selected colonies and subjected to restriction digestion to verify insertion size, and the sequence was then verified. Plasmid DNA was purified for transfection into transformed human kidney HK293 cells using liposome-mediation (Superfect, Invitrogen). Optimal conditions were determined using transient expression, and then stably transfected cells were prepared. Immunoblotting of conditioned medium allowed selection of cells with the highest expression level (1–2 μg/ml). Several 1-liter batches of conditioned serum-free medium were prepared, treated with 1 mm Pefabloc protease inhibitor (Roche Diagnostics) and frozen until purification procedures were performed. For purification, conditioned medium was concentrated 10-fold using Amicon YM-30 membrane filtration (Millipore Corp., Bedford MA) and subjected to heparin-Sepharose chromatography at pH 6.3 as described for plasma ZPI followed by either MonoQ or MonoS chromatography (Amersham Biosciences) using an NaCl gradient at pH 6.3 (1Han X. Fiehler R. Broze Jr., G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9250-9255Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). FXa Activity Measurements—To assess the effect of ZPI on FXa activity, prothrombinase assays were performed with 0.5 nm FXa, 25 μm phospholipids, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.6 μm prothrombin with or without 20 pm FVa in Hepes-buffered saline (HBS) containing 0.5% BSA (25Heeb M.J. Mesters R.M. Tans G. Rosing J. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2872-2877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, variable ZPI and protein Z were preincubated for 5 min with all components except prothrombin; prothrombin was added, and subaliquots were taken over time and quenched in EDTA prior to the addition of thrombin substrate; the linear rate of thrombin formation was determined in a Biotek EL312 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader with Kineti-calc software (Winooski, VT). Phospholipid vesicles for prothrombinase assays and FXase assays were prepared by sonication and contained 20% phosphatidylserine and 80% phosphatidylcholine (25Heeb M.J. Mesters R.M. Tans G. Rosing J. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2872-2877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FXa two-stage assays were performed according to Han et al. (1Han X. Fiehler R. Broze Jr., G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9250-9255Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Briefly, prolongation of FXa-initiated clotting times by ZPI was measured in FX-deficient plasma supplemented with 0.5 μg/ml protein Z. FXase Assays—To assess the effect of ZPI on FIXa activity, FXase assays were performed with 2 nm FIXa, 25 μm phospholipids, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.2 μm FX, with or without 80 pm FVIIIa in HBS-0.5% BSA. In some experiments where noted, 30 pm FIXa and varying concentrations of FVIIIa (25–250 pm) were used, before or after ZPI-FIXa interaction, to determine whether FVIIIa was able to protect FIXa from ZPI inhibition. FVIII was activated immediately prior to use with 0.05 units/ml thrombin for 1 min followed by inactivation of thrombin with 0.075 units/ml hirudin (Calbiochem-Novabiochem). Variable ZPI and protein Z were preincubated with all components except FX for 5 min; FX was added, and subaliquots were taken over time and quenched in EDTA prior to the addition of FXa substrate; the rate of FXa formation was determined using a kinetic plate reader as for prothrombinase assays. For experiments where noted, reaction mixtures were diluted in EDTA and allowed to stand for 60 min to allow for any inhibition of the FXa product by ZPI/protein Z to be reversed before the measurement of FXa amidolytic activity as a reflection of inhibition of FIXa. SDS-PAGE and Immunoblotting—Aliquots of FXase incubation mixtures were taken over time into 70 °C SDS sample buffer for 5 min and then subjected to electrophoresis on 7% Tris acetate gels (Invitrogen) and electrotransfer to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked with 1% casein-Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and immunoblotted with monoclonal antibody to FX (Biodesign, Saco, ME) followed by biotinylated anti-mouse IgG 1:1000 (Pierce), streptavidin horseradish peroxidase 1:500 (Pierce), SuperSignal chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce), and exposure to film. Since FX substrate was in large excess to FXa product, before development, blots were cut horizontally between the 43- and 68-kDa molecular mass markers to separate FXa from FX. Blots were scanned and quantified using SigmaGel (Eurostat, Bedfordshire, UK) to determine the relative amounts of FXa generated in the presence or absence of ZPI/protein Z. Tritiation of FX and Measurement of Activation of [3H]FX—FX was tritiated by reductive alkylation of carbohydrate groups that reside primarily in its activation peptide region, using NaB3H4 as described (26Zur M. Nemerson Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 5703-5707Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) followed by chromatography on a Sephacryl-300 column. The product retained 80% of its clotting activity as measured in FX-deficient plasma, contained 57,000 cpm/μg of FX, and was stored in small aliquots at –70 °C. Subaliquots (50 μl) of FXase incubation mixtures containing labeled and unlabeled FX were taken over time and mixed with 50 μlof cold 0.13% BSA. Cold 15% trichloroacetic acid (50 μl) was added and mixed and allowed to stand on ice for 2 min before centrifugation at 9,000 × g for 5 min. An aliquot of the trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction containing released 3H activation peptide was counted in scintillation fluid. Counts in inhibited mixtures were expressed as a percentage of the controls containing no ZPI/protein Z. FIXa-based Clotting Activity—To monitor inhibition of FIXa by ZPI in a plasma milieu, a FIXa-based two-stage clotting assay was developed. FIXa (10 nm) was incubated in a volume of 50 μl for 3 min at 37 °C with 125 μm phospholipid vesicles, 6 mm CaCl2, 1.5 mg/ml fibrinogen, 1.0% BSA-HBS ± ZPI ± protein Z. Prewarmed 1% BSA-HBS (52.5 μl), 10 μl of 60 mm CaCl2, and 12.5 μl of FIX-deficient plasma were added, and the clotting time was measured in an ST4 coagulometer (Stago). The base clot time without ZPI was ∼100 s. Surface Plasmon Resonance Binding Experiments—Monclonal antibody against FIX (14 μg/ml) was coupled through amine groups to a CM5 chip activated as described by Biacore, Inc. using a Biacore 3000 instrument at a flow rate of 5 μl/min until 2,100 response units were coupled. Unreacted sites on the chip were blocked with ethanolamine. FIXa (12 nm) was injected at a flow rate of 10 μl/min in filtered HBS-0.025% BSA-5 mm CaCl2. After 2.5 min, buffer was injected, and FIXa (294 ± 4 response units) dissociated at a negligible rate. ZPI (4.5–36 nm) was injected in the same buffer at the same flow rate for 2.5 min, and binding was monitored. Another wash was used to follow the dissociation of ZPI from FIXa, and then the chip was regenerated with 0.1 m glycine, 0.05 m NaCl, pH 2.5. For some experiments, freshly prepared FVIIIa was injected after the FIXa followed by a wash and then ZPI. Global fits of the series of sensorgrams were performed using Biaevaluation software to calculate kon, koff, and Kdapp = koff/kon. Purified ZPI and rZPI—Plasma-derived ZPI was purified to >90% homogeneity as judged by SDS-PAGE; rZPI was purified to >95% homogeneity. rZPI comigrated with plasma-derived ZPI on SDS-PAGE. On some stained gels and blots, there was a doublet for plasma-derived ZPI, suggesting that a minor proportion of the ZPI might be proteolytically cleaved or differentially glycosylated. In FXa two-stage assays, rZPI had activity similar to that of plasma-derived ZPI (not shown). Activity of both plasma-derived ZPI and rZPI was lost over time; therefore, small aliquots were frozen to minimize the number of freeze/thaw cycles. Inhibition of Prothrombinase Activity by ZPI—Plasma-derived ZPI and rZPI inhibited the prothrombinase activity of FXa in a similar, strictly protein Z-dependent manner, as reported (3Han X. Fiehler R. Broze Jr., G.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 3049-3055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of even 20 pm FXa cofactor FVa reduced the efficiency of ZPI/protein Z inhibition of 0.5 nm FXa by about 2-fold (not shown). The concentrations of ZPI and protein Z required for 50% inhibition of the prothrombinase activity of 0.5 nm FXa in 5 min in several experiments were well below their respective plasma concentrations of 3.8 and 2.6 μg/ml (53 and 41 nm). Inhibition of FXase Activity by ZPI—To determine whether ZPI might also inhibit FIXa (a homologue of FXa), FXase assays containing FIXa, phospholipids, and Ca2+ ± FVIIIa were preincubated ± ZPI ± protein Z, before the addition of FX, and then the generation of FXa was monitored as described under “Experimental Procedures.” As observed for prothrombinase assays, the level of ZPI required for 50% inhibition of FXase activity in 5 min was below its plasma level in several experiments (Fig. 1). In these initial experiments, the amidolytic activity of the FXa product was directly measured to monitor inhibition of FXase, but part of the inhibition observed could be correlated with the inhibition of the FXa product by ZPI/protein Z. However, the pattern of inhibition of FXase differed from that observed in prothrombinase assays in that ZPI inhibition of FXase was much less dependent on protein Z, especially in the presence of FVIIIa (Fig. 1B). This suggested that ZPI might be inhibiting FIXa in addition to the FXa product. If so, then the type of experiments in Fig. 1 somewhat resembles the hypothetical physiological coagulation condition in which both FX and FIX have been partly activated. Immunoblotting of FXase Inhibition by ZPI—To further test the notion that ZPI can inhibit FIXa, the FXa physical product of FXase mixtures was semiquantitated using an immunoblotting assay. Aliquots were collected 1–2.5 min after the addition of FX and subjected to immunoblotting. As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, aliquots of FXase mixtures that included ZPI/protein Z contained significantly less FXa than did control FXase mixtures without ZPI/protein Z. A quantitative scan of these blots through the center of each band revealed that 78% less FXa was generated by FIXa in the presence of 2 μg/ml ZPI, and 42% less FXa was generated in the presence of 1 μg/ml ZPI. Measurement of ZPI Inhibition of the FXase Activity of FIXa after Reversal of any FXa Inhibition—If ZPI inhibition of the FXa product of the FXase could be reversed, it would then be possible to measure inhibition of the FXase activity of FIXa by measuring residual FXa activity. Therefore, the possible reversibility of FXa inhibition by ZPI/protein Z was assessed. Mixtures of FXa, Ca2+, and phospholipids containing ±ZPI and ± protein Z, after 5 min of incubation, were diluted into EDTA-containing buffer and allowed to stand for various times before measuring FXa amidolytic activity. When FXa amidolytic activity was measured within 30 s, FXa activity was inhibited ∼67% by ZPI/protein Z when compared with controls with no ZPI/protein Z (assigned 100% activity) or with protein Z only. However, FXa amidolytic activity was gradually regained over time, so that by 60 min, ∼86% of activity was recovered in several experiments (Fig. 2A). Thus, inhibition of FXa by ZPI/protein Z was reversed by dilution in EDTA-containing buffer. This finding, illustrated in Fig. 2A, made it feasible to measure the inhibition of the FXase activity of FIXa by monitoring the FXa product after quenching it by dilution in buffer with EDTA and allowing time for any ZPI/protein Z inhibition of FIXa to be reversed before measuring the amount of FXa formed by amidolytic activity. Under these conditions, inhibition of the FXase activity of FIXa could be demonstrated at concentrations of ZPI well below plasma level (Fig. 2, B and C), with 50% inhibition at ∼ 1.3 μg/ml (18 nm). In agreement with the data shown in Fig. 1, ZPI inhibition of FIXa was much less dependent on protein Z than has been reported for ZPI inhibition of FXa, especially in the presence of FVIIIa. Protein Z alone had little or no effect on FXase activity. Effect of Varying FVIIIa on ZPI Inhibition of FIXa—The standard FXase assay uses an excess of FIXa over FVIIIa. To study the effects of FVIIIa on inhibition of FIXa by ZPI, FVIIIa was varied from conditions of a slight molar excess FIXa to conditions of almost 10-fold molar excess FVIIIa. When FIXa was incubated with ZPI prior to FVIIIa addition, the extent of inhibition of FIXa was not affected even when FVIIIa was in molar excess (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, when ZPI was added after FIXa and FVIIIa were allowed to form a complex, low concentrations of FVIIIa appeared to stimulate ZPI inhibition of FIXa, whereas increasing FVIIIa concentrations appeared protective of FIXa, and inhibition by ZPI was gradually diminished (Fig. 3B). In other experiments not shown, FVa was added after or before the incubation of FXa with ZPI/protein Z. When FXa was incubated with ZPI prior to FVa addition, the extent of inhibition of FXa by ZPI was not affected even when FVa was in molar excess. When ZPI was added after FXa and FVa were allowed to form a complex, FVa was strongly protective, even when FXa was in molar excess to FVa. Thus, FVa was more protective of FXa than FVIIIa was of FIXa. Unusual Time Course for ZPI Inhibition of FIXa and FXa—ZPI inhibition of FIXa, like that of FXa, was rapid, reaching a maximum in <100 s (40 s of preincubation plus 60 s of incubation before sampling) (Fig. 4); thus, maximum inhibition was reached in each of the experiments described above in which ZPI was incubated with FXase or prothrombinase components for 5 min. The maximum level of inhibition of FIXa was proportional to the concentration of ZPI. A plot of plateau activity versus concentration of ZPI from the data in Fig. 4 suggested that half-maximum inhibition of 1 nm FIXa occurred at 1 μg/ml ZPI (14 nm) (plot not shown). This concentration was found again to be below the plasma concentration of ZPI. When the same preparation of ZPI was used on the same day to inhibit prothrombinase with 20 pm FVa and FXase with 80 pm FVIIIa, the potency of inhibition of each was similar (Fig. 4, dashed versus solid lines). ZPI Inhibition of FX Activation Peptide Release—Since ZPI was reported not to inhibit FIXa (3Han X. Fiehler R. Broze Jr., G.J. Blood. 2000; 96: 3049-3055Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and since the activity assays shown in Figs. 2, 3, 4 might still be complicated by measuring a small amount of remaining ZPI inhibition of FXa product, several additional approaches were used to investigate ZPI inhibition of FIXa, as described below. FX was tritium-labeled to follow the release of 3H-labeled activation peptide during FX activation by FIXa. [3H]FX was 99.8% trichloroacetic acid-precipitable, whereas the released activation peptide was soluble in cold trichloroacetic acid; thus, the trichloroacetic acid-soluble fraction could be counted as a measure of FX activation. Using this method, 50% inhibition of the FXase activity of FIXa was observed at ∼1 μg/ml ZPI in the presence of 80 pm FVIIIa, and inhibition was essentially protein Z-independent (Fig. 5B). In the absence of FVIIIa, inhibition was modestly stimulated by protein Z (Fig. 5A). These data suggest that ZPI alone is an efficient inhibitor of FIXa but that either protein Z or low concentrations of FVIIIa can modestly enhance inhibition. Inhibition of FIXa Amidolytic Activity by ZPI—The amidolytic activity of FIXa is not as physiologically relevant as the FXase activity of FIXa, but ZPI inhibition of FIXa does not involve possible inhibition of any FXa product. Therefore, a fluorogenic amidolytic substrate for FIXa was also used to measure the inhibition of FIXa by ZPI. Since this kind of assay requires higher concentrations of FIXa, 5 nm FIXa was preincubated with 7–20-fold molar excess of ZPI for 4 min in the presence of 5 mm Ca2+ ± protein Z/phospholipids, and then amidolytic activity was measured. The data shown in Fig. 6 demonstrate that 50% inhibition of 5 nm FIXa activity was achieved with ∼7.2 μg/ml (∼100 nm) ZPI. Protein Z and phospholipids were not required for ZPI inhibition. Protein Z did not inhibit FIXa and ZPI had no effect on the substrate in the absence of FIXa (data not shown). In other control experiments, ZPI did not inhibit the amidolytic activity of two other coagulation proteases, thrombin or activated protein C, in agreement with a previous study (1Han X. Fiehler R. Broze Jr., G.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9250-9255Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Inhibition of FIXa in a Clotting Assay—In a FIXa-based clotting assay using FIX-deficient plasma, ZPI prolonged clotting times in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 7). As observed above, protein Z had little effect in combination with ZPI, and the addition of protein Z antibodies to the plasma had no effect."
https://openalex.org/W2103536763,"c-Abl is a tyrosine kinase that can act as a regulator of cell growth and apoptosis in response to stress. Using cell lines expressing c-Abl in an inducible manner, we identified genes whose expression was regulated by c-Abl kinase activity. Microarray analysis indicated that Early Growth Response-1 (EGR1) gene expression is induced by c-Abl kinase activity, which was confirmed at the message and protein levels. Promoter mapping experiments revealed that c-Abl utilizes three distal serum response elements (SREs) in the EGR1 promoter, which are transactivated by mitogen/extracellular receptor kinase (MEK/ERK) signaling. PD 95089, a specific inhibitor of MEK/ERK signaling, attenuated c-Abl-mediated upregulation of EGR1 expression in a dose-dependent manner. Similar results were obtained by using a dominant-negative mutant of mitogen/extracellular kinase. Significantly, hydrogen peroxide-induced EGR1 expression appears to be mediated by c-Abl, as cells expressing dominant negative c-Abl, and c-Abl-/- murine embryonic fibroblasts, are completely defective in hydrogen peroxide-induced EGR1 expression. In addition, c-Abl-induced apoptosis is partially mitigated by EGR1 activity, as cells devoid of EGR1 expression undergo reduced rates of c-Abl-induced apoptosis. Together, these results indicate that c-Abl promotes the induction of EGR1 through the MEK/ERK pathway in regulating apoptotic response to oxidative stress."
https://openalex.org/W2062774943,"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including sulindac sulfide are known to exert cancer chemopreventative activity in a range of cell lines. This activity has been shown to involve the upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/CIP1. It is also known that NSAIDs can act as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists and antagonists. In this study, we show that sulindac sulfide acts both as a PPARγ agonist and a PPARδ antagonist in an immortalized prostatic epithelial cell line (PNT1A). We utilized siRNA technology to show that PPARγ is required for both growth inhibition and p21WAF1/CIP1 upregulation in response to sulindac sulfide treatment in PNT1A cells. In addition, the overexpression of PPARδ partially rescued these cells from growth inhibition and also dramatically inhibited sulindac sulfide-mediated p21WAF1/CIP1 upregulation. Together these data identify a novel link between PPARγ/PPARδ/p21WAF1/CIP1 and the cancer chemo-preventative properties of NSAIDs."
https://openalex.org/W2036284590,"Type II topoisomerases (TOP2) introduce transient double-stranded DNA breaks through a covalent TOP2-DNA intermediate. Anticancer agents like etoposide kill cells by trapping covalent TOP2-DNA cleavable complexes. Pathways influencing the repair of cleavable complexes are expected to be major determinants of therapeutic response to etoposide. Rb1 is required to enforce cell cycle checkpoints in response to DNA damage, but evidence for a direct role in the processing and repair of DNA lesions is lacking. We observe that degradation of trapped TOP2-cleavable complexes, liberation of DNA strand breaks, and repair of those breaks occurs more efficiently in cells expressing Rb1 protein (pRb). Cells lacking pRb are more sensitive to etoposide-induced cytotoxicity. Rb1-mediated processing and repair of TOP2-cleavable complexes is genetically separable from its ability to bind E2F and enforce DNA damage-induced cell cycle checkpoints. Rb1 protein binds both TOP2 and BRCA1 in intact cells, and pRb is required for association between TOP2 and BRCA1. These results suggest that pRb facilitates processing and repair of TOP2-cleavable complexes by recruiting proteins like BRCA1 to the damaged site. The functional status of pRb, therefore, may influence sensitivity to etoposide by facilitating the repair of trapped TOP2-DNA complexes as well as by enforcing cell cycle checkpoints."

Residues toward the C-terminus are numbered 1′, 2′, 3′, etc. Residues toward the N-terminus are numbered -1′, -2′, etc. For the 0′, residues are GABAA receptors α1R255, β1R250, and γ2R265. levels (14Unwin N.

Information on the dynamic protein motion in the membrane-spanning domain has been obtained using the substituted cysteine accessibility method (15Akabas M.H. Stauffer D.A. Xu M. Karlin A.

Substituted cysteine accessibility method studies of the β1 subunit M2 segment in the presence of GABA showed a high degree of accessibility of the residues above 11′, suggesting loose packing and/or high mobility (19Goren E.N. Reeves D.C. Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11198-11205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In contrast, cysteine substituted at the cytoplasmic end of the channel between 2′ and 6′ had the limited accessibility consistent with that region of the channel being tightly packed with low mobility (10Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 19Goren E.N. Reeves D.C. Akabas M.H. J. Biol.

Trends Neurosci. 2004; 27: 329-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Disulfide trapping experiments between engineered Cys residues substituted for aligned M2 channel-lining residues at the 20′ level show that the M2 segments undergo translational motion across the channel lumen in the absence and the presence of GABA (20Horenstein J. Riegelhaupt P. Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1573-1581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In αβ receptors no disulfide bonds formed between Cys residues substituted for the 9′ and 13′ residues (17Horenstein J. Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Akabas M.H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In contrast, at the 6′ level we observed state-dependent disulfide bond formation in the presence of GABA, but not in its absence, between Cys residues in adjacent subunits. The 6′ disulfide bond formation significantly increased the channels' spontaneous open probability (17Horenstein J. Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Akabas M.H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). We suggested that channel gating might involve a rotation of the M2 segments. Based on both the 9- and 4-Å resolution electron density maps of the ACh receptor, Unwin (14Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar, 21Unwin N. Nature. 1995; 373: 37-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar) also suggested that the M2 segments may rotate during channel opening but to a much smaller extent. In voltage-dependent potassium channels it has been suggested that the S4 voltage sensor rotates, although other models have been proposed (22Cha A. Snyder G.E. Selvin P.R. Bezanilla F. Nature. 1999; 402: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar, 23Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Ruta V. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Nature. 2003; 423: 33-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). Here we have used disulfide trapping experiments to probe the spontaneous thermal motion of the M2 segments for evidence of rotational motion. The ability of a pair of Cys residues to form a disulfide bond depends on the presence of an oxidizing environment and on the pair's collision frequency. The collision frequency depends on the average separation distance between the sulfhydryls, their relative orientation in the protein, and the protein's flexibility/mobility in the region of the Cys residues. We used copper phenanthroline (Cu:phen) to create an oxidizing environment. Cu:phen catalyzes the formation of reactive oxygen species such as superoxide and hydroxyl radicals from molecular oxygen (24Kobashi K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1968; 158: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). Spontaneous disulfide bond formation indicates that mildly oxidizing conditions due to ambient oxygen in our buffer were sufficient to promote disulfide bond formation. This is not fundamentally different from disulfide bond formation in the more oxidizing environment created by Cu:phen. Spontaneous disulfide bond formation as compared with Cu:phen-induced formation is simply a measure of the relative propensity to form disulfide bonds. For a disulfide bond to form, the Cys α carbons must come to within 5.6 Å of one another (25Careaga C.L. Falke J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1219-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). It is important to recognize that formation of a disulfide bond does not imply that the time average separation of the two α carbons is 5.6 Å. One can infer that in the course of thermal motion the cysteines can approach to within this distance. Disulfide trapping has been used to study protein mobility and proximity relationships between residues in both water-soluble and integral membrane proteins (25Careaga C.L. Falke J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1219-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 26Regan L. Rockwell A. Wasserman Z. DeGrado W.

A. 2001; 98: 10055-10060Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). For these experiments we took advantage of the fact that in αβγ receptors there is a single γ-α subunit interface. Based on our earlier substituted cysteine accessibility method experiments in the α subunit we predicted that the γ2M2 14′ residue lies in the α-γ subunit interface (10Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). We probed the ability of a Cys substituted for γ214′ to form disulfide bonds with Cys substituted for α112′ to α116′ residues in the absence of GABA. We hypothesized that if disulfide bonds could form between γ214′ and multiple sites on the αM2 segment, it would suggest that αM2 was moving relative to the γ214′ position. Our data demonstrate that γ14′C formed disulfide bonds with multiple α-substituted Cys residues that are separated by ∼160° on the circumference of the α helix. We also probed the ability of γ213′C to form disulfide bonds with α111′C to α113′C. The γ213′C formed a disulfide bond with α113′C. Mutagenesis and Oocyte Expression—All cysteine substitution mutants were made using PCR as described previously (19Goren E.N. Reeves D.C. Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11198-11205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). mRNA was synthesized in vitro using the AmpliCap T7 high yield message maker kit (Epicenter Technologies, Madison, WI). mRNA was dissolved in diethylpyrocarbamate-treated water and stored at -80 °C. Xenopus laevis specimens were purchased from Nasco Science (Fort Atkinson, WI). Stage V-VI oocytes were defolliculated by incubation in 2 mg/ml type 1A collagenase (Sigma) for 75 min. Oocytes were washed in OR2 (82.5 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm HEPES; pH adjusted to 7.5 with NaOH) and kept in OR3 (70% Leibovitz's L-15 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10 mm HEPES, 50 μg/ml tetracycline, and 50 μg/ml gentamicin). Oocytes were injected 24 h after isolation with 50 nl of a 1:1:1 mixture of rat α1/β1/γ2S subunit mRNA (200 pg/nl) and kept in OR3 medium for 2-5 days at 17 °C. Reagents—A 100 mm stock solution of GABA (Sigma) in water was aliquoted and stored at -20 °C. 1 m stock solutions of dithiothreitol (DTT; Sigma) and o-phenanthroline (Sigma) were made in nominally calcium-free frog Ringer's solution (CFFR; 115 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm KCl, 1.8 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5) and dimethyl sulfoxide, respectively, aliquoted, and stored for not more than one month at -20 °C. A stock solution of 100 mm CuSO4 was made in water. CuSO4 and o-phenanthroline were mixed in CFFR directly before use to a final concentration of 100 μm CuSO4 and 200 μm o-phenanthroline expressed as 100:200 μm Cu:phen. Electrophysiology—Two electrode voltage clamp recordings were conducted at room temperature in a 250-μl chamber continuously perfused at 5-6 ml/min with CFFR solution at a holding potential of -60 mV. The ground electrode was connected to the bath via a 3 m KCl/agar bridge. Glass microelectrodes filled with 3 m KCl had a resistance of <2 megaohms. Data were acquired and analyzed using a TEV-200 amplifier (Dagan Instruments, Minneapolis, MN), a Digidata 1322A data interface (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA), and pClamp 8 software (Axon Instruments). Currents were elicited by applications of GABA separated by at least 5 min of CFFR wash to allow complete recovery from desensitization. Currents were judged to be stable if the variation between consecutive GABA pulses was <5%. Disulfide Bond-induced Inhibition—Once GABA-induced control currents had stabilized, 10 mm DTT was applied for 3 min. GABA was reapplied directly following DTT to determine the extent of potentiation produced by the reduction of spontaneously formed disulfide bonds. The cells were treated with 100:200 μm Cu:phen for 1 min, and then two or more GABA test pulses were applied. DTT can both reduce a disulfide bond and bind Cu2+ with high affinity. To confirm that the ability of DTT to reverse the effects of Cu:phen was due to disulfide bond formation and not to Cu2+ chelation by one or both of the engineered Cys residues, we assayed the effect of a 1-min application of 1 mm EGTA. EGTA chelates Cu2+ with high affinity but cannot reduce a disulfide bond. If EGTA failed to reverse the effect of Cu:phen, a second application of 10 mm DTT (3 min) was followed by a final test pulse of GABA to demonstrate that DTT was able to reverse the effect of Cu:phen. The extent of potentiation attributed to the reduction of spontaneously formed disulfide bonds was calculated by the equation percentage effect = [(IDTT - I)/I]·100, where IDTT is the GABA-induced current following application of DTT and I is the current prior to DTT treatment. The effect of Cu:phen was calculated in a similar way except that I is the GABA current after Cu:phen. 500 μm GABA was used for all experiments except where specified. The maximal currents and percentage effect for each reagent are presented as the mean ± S.E. Reoxidation Rates—A test pulse of 500 μm GABA was followed by a 3-min application of 10 mm DTT and a test pulse of GABA. The current magnitude of the second test pulse was significantly larger than the GABA current before DTT. Cu:phen (50:100 μm) with or without saturating GABA was applied for 3 s. After a 5-min wash with CFFR, a GABA test pulse was applied, and the peak current was measured. The brief pulses of Cu:phen alternating with GABA test pulses continued until the GABA test pulse current magnitude reached a plateau. The durations of the Cu:phen applications varied between 3 and 40 s depending on the extent of inhibition caused by the previous pulse. As the GABA test currents reached the plateau, longer Cu:phen applications were made to demonstrate that the reaction had gone to completion. The magnitude of GABA-induced test pulse currents was normalized relative to the current induced by GABA test pulses after the application of DTT. The normalized currents were plotted as a function of cumulative exposure time to the Cu:phen and fitted with the equation It = (I0 - I∞)exp(-t/τ) + I∞, where It is the current at time t, I0 is the initial current, I∞ is the final current, and τ is the time at which 63% of the total current decay occurred. Statistics—All statistical analyses were performed in Prism 3.02 using a one-way analysis of variance followed by the Newman-Keuls multiple comparison test. All data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Characterization of the Individual Cysteine Mutants—Oocytes expressing each of the individual α1 subunit Cys-substitution mutants α112′C, α113′C, α114′C, α115′C, and α116′C, when co-expressed with wild-type β1 and γ2, displayed GABA-activated currents (Fig. 1). The currents of α115′Cβ1γ2 were significantly smaller than those of the other mutants but were nevertheless sufficiently large for the purposes of these experiments. Application of 10 mm DTT for 3 min had no effect on the subsequent GABA-induced currents of any of the single α1 Cys mutants (Fig. 2D). We infer that none of the α1 Cys mutants formed spontaneous disulfide bonds between the two α-engineered Cys residues within a receptor or between the engineered Cys residues and the endogenous Cys residues. Oocytes expressing either of the two γ2 Cys mutants used in this study, γ213′C or γ214′C, with wild type α1 and β1 subunits also displayed GABA-induced currents and were unaffected by a 3-min application of 10 mm DTT (Figs. 1 and 2D). Oxidation by a 1-min application of 100:200 μm Cu:phen to oocytes expressing αβγ receptors with one of the Cys substitution mutants had no effect on the subsequent GABA-induced currents (Fig. 3B). We infer that none of the individual α1 or γ2 Cys mutants formed disulfide bonds with either the engineered or the endogenous Cys residues. Spontaneous Disulfide Bond Formation between Pairs of Cysteine Mutants—Oocytes expressing each of the individual α1 Cys mutants with γ214′C and wild type β1 displayed GABA-induced currents (Figs. 1 and 2). For two of the double Cys mutants, α115′Cβ1γ214′C and α116′Cβ1γ214′C, a 3-min application of 10 mm DTT significantly increased the subsequent GABA-induced currents (Fig. 2). The increase in GABA-induced current was reversed by a 1-min application of the oxidizing reagent Cu:phen (100:200 μm). A subsequent application of 10 mm DTT for 3 min restored the GABA-induced currents to a level similar to the level after the first application of DTT (Fig. 2E). We infer that for these two double mutants a disulfide bond had formed spontaneously prior to the start of the experiment. The disulfide bond could be reduced by DTT and reformed by oxidation with Cu:phen. The ability to reverse the Cu:phen effect with DTT indicated that the Cu:phen effect was due to disulfide bond formation and not because of the oxidation of the engineered Cys to higher order oxidation states. A disulfide bond also formed spontaneously between γ213′C and α113′C when the mutants were expressed in αβγ receptors. An initial application of 10 mm DTT (3 min) caused a significant increase in subsequent GABA-induced currents (Fig. 2D). This increase was reversed by Cu:phen application in a manner similar to that described above (Fig. 2E). To rule out the possibility that the inhibition caused by the Cu:phen application might due to Cu2+ binding by the engineered Cys, we applied 1 mm EGTA for 1 min. This had no effect on the GABA-induced currents (Fig. 2). Cu:Phen-induced Disulfide Bond Formation.—For the α112′C, α113′C, and α114′C that did not spontaneously form disulfide bonds with γ214′C, we tested whether disulfide bond formation could be induced in the more oxidizing environment created by Cu:phen application. A 1-min application of 100:200 μm Cu:phen to oocytes expressing α113′Cβ1γ214′C caused a significant inhibition (43% ± 3; n = 11) of the subsequent GABA-induced currents (Fig. 3). This inhibition was not reversed by a 1-min application of 1 mm EGTA but was reversed by a 3-min application of 10 mm DTT (Fig. 3A). We inferred that a disulfide bond could be formed between the α113′- and γ214′-engineered Cys. A similar application of Cu:phen to oocytes expressing either α112′Cβ1γ214′C or α114′Cβ1γ214′C had no effect on subsequent GABA currents. This finding implies that no disulfide bonds could be induced in these double mutants. Time Constants for Cu:Phen-induced Disulfide Bond Formation.—We compared the time constants for Cu:phen-induced disulfide bond formation between γ214′C and the three α1 Cys mutants, 13′,15′ and 16′, with which it formed disulfide bonds. Actual rate constants were not determined because the concentration of the reactants is unknown, but rather the time constant for the decay of GABA-induced currents due to disulfide bond formation was determined. The time constants were calculated by determining the effects of repeated brief (3-40 s) applications of 50:100 μm Cu:phen on the GABA-induced test currents as illustrated in Fig. 4A. The resultant GABA-induced currents were normalized by the initial GABA current and plotted as a function of cumulative Cu:phen application time and fitted with a single exponential decayfunction (Fig. 4B). The time constants for disulfide bond formation in the absence of GABA between γ214′C and both α115′C and α116′C were similar, ∼5 s (TABLE ONE). The time constant for disulfide bond formation between γ214′C and α113′C was larger, ∼9 s, than that for the other two pairs (TABLE ONE). This slower time constant is consistent with the lack of spontaneous disulfide bond formation between this pair of Cys mutants, which suggests that the collision frequency is lower between this pair of Cys mutants. The time constants of Cu:phen-induced disulfide bond formation were also measured in the presence of GABA. The time constants with the γ214′C were unaffected by the presence of GABA.TABLE ONETime constants (τ) for disulfide bond formation between different cysteine pairsMutantCu:phen (τ)naNumber of oocytesCu:phen + GABA (τ)naNumber of oocytesCα separation distancessÅα13′Cγ13′C15 ± 2bTime constant is significantly different from mutants α15′Cγ14′C and α16′Cγ14′C (p < 0.05)35 ± 0.7cSignificant difference between time constants in the presence and absence of GABA (p < 0.05)48.4dCα-Cα separation distance for respective positions measured from the 2BG9 atomic coordinatesα13′Cγ14′C9 ± 3411 ± 336.6α15′Cγ14′C5 ± 155 ± 2310.4α16′Cγ14′C6 ± 144 ± 147.7a Number of oocytesb Time constant is significantly different from mutants α15′Cγ14′C and α16′Cγ14′C (p < 0.05)c Significant difference between time constants in the presence and absence of GABA (p < 0.05)d Cα-Cα separation distance for respective positions measured from the 2BG9 atomic coordinates Open table in a new tab The time constant for disulfide bond formation between the aligned 13′ positions, γ213′C and α113′C, was slower than that for the disulfide bonds formed with γ214′C. For this 13′ pair of residues the time constant increased 3-fold in the presence of GABA (TABLE ONE). We do not know whether disulfide bond formation in the presence of GABA is occurring in the open or the desensitized states. To ensure that the measured time constants were not limited by our solution exchange rates, we measured the time constant of the change in the resting membrane current as we switched the perfusion solution from CFFR to a high potassium solution (115 mm KCl, 2.5 mm NaCl, 1.8 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). The current change in response to the switch from CFFR to high K+ solution was best fit with a double exponential equation (Fig. 4C). The fast time constant (0.6 ± 0.1 s, n = 5) accounted for 75 ± 6% of the current change. The slow time constant (7.5 ± 1.2 s, n = 5) accounted for only 25% of the current change. The major component of the solution exchange took place on a time scale 10 times faster than the time constant of the disulfide bond formation. Thus, solution exchange rates did not limit the measurement of the disulfide bond formation time constants. GABAA receptor channel gating involves conformational change in the M2 channel-lining segments in order to open the channel gate (10Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 4Lester H.A. Dibas M.I. Dahan D.S. Leite J.F. Dougherty D.A.

The 4-Å resolution structure of the homologous ACh receptor provides a static view of the closed state structure but little insight into the mobility of the protein. In the region of the 20′ position, the M2 segments undergo significant spontaneous thermal motion, but the extent of this motion deeper in the channel and the nature of the motion, rotation or translation or both, is unknown (17Horenstein J. Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Akabas M.H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 20Horenstein J. Riegelhaupt P. Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1573-1581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In the present work we have probed the extent of spontaneous thermal motion between engineered Cys residues on the M2 segments of adjacent subunits at the extracellular end of the putative channel gate (14Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar) using disulfide trapping. These experiments showed that disulfide bonds formed spontaneously between a Cys at γ214′ and a Cys at either the α115′ or the α116′ position. The disulfide bond formation rates were similar for these two γ-α Cys pairs. This result suggests that the relative collision frequency between the γ214′C and the α115′ and α116′ positions were similar. In a more oxidizing environment created by the presence of copper phenanthroline, a disulfide bond was also formed between γ214′C and α113′C. The disulfide bond formation rate was significantly slower between these two residues than between the other two γ-α Cys pairs, suggesting that the collision frequency between γ214′ and the α113′ position is lower than that with the other two αM2 positions. In contrast to the disulfide bonds formed by γ14′C, the disulfide bond formation rate for the bond formed between γ13′C and α13′C was significantly faster in the presence of GABA compared with that in the absence of GABA. In the presence of GABA the channels undergo transitions between the open and desensitized states. We cannot distinguish in which state disulfide bond formation is occurring. We can infer, however, that the collision frequency between aligned positions at the 13′ level is greater in the presence of GABA. The extent of the motion of one M2 segment relative to the adjacent M2 segment can be estimated from the separation distances of the aligned positions in the 4-Å resolution structure of the homologous ACh receptor (14Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). In a disulfide bond, the center-to-center distance separating the sulfurs is 2 Å, and that separating the α carbons is ∼5.6 Å (30Sowdhamini R. Srinivasan N. Shoichet B. Santi D.V. Ramakrishnan C. Balaram P. Protein Eng. 1989; 3: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 25Careaga C.L. Falke J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1219-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). In the ACh receptor structure (Protein Data Bank code 2BG9) the α carbon separation between the positions aligned with γ14′ and α15′ and α16′ is ∼10 and ∼8 Å, respectively (measured from the protein data bank 2BG9 atomic coordinate file). The separation between γ214′ and α113′ is ∼7 Å. The sulfur-sulfur separation distances are dependent on the specific side chain rotamer used and can vary by 2 to 3 Å. Thus, distance alone does not determine the likelihood of disulfide bond formation, suggesting that certain motions are constrained by the protein structure. This was observed previously in the aspartate chemotaxis receptor (25Careaga C.L. Falke J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1219-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). On the circumference of an α helix the 15′ and 16′ positions are separated by an arc of 100°, whereas the 15′ and 13′ positions are separated by an arc of 160°. A rotational motion of the αM2 segment could move these residues into close proximity with γ14′. This would require the αM2 segment to rotate on its helix axis from its position in the 4-Å structure ∼80° in one direction for α15′ and 80° in the opposite direction for α13′ (Fig. 5). Looking from the extracellular side down the M2 helix, the counter-clockwise rotation that would bring α115′ into close proximity with γ214′ is more likely than the clockwise rotation that would bring α113′ into close proximity. Consistent with the M2 segments undergoing significant rotational motion, we showed previously that a disulfide bond could form between Cys residues substituted at the channel-lining 6′ position in adjacent subunits (17Horenstein J. Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Akabas M.H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). At the 6′ level the disulfide bond involved the non-GABA binding subunit. In order for aligned positions on adjacent M2 segments to come into close proximity, the M2 segments must rotate asymmetrically either in time, one before the next, or in space, toward each other. There are precedents for helix rotation in proteins, including the aspartate chemotaxis receptor (25Careaga C.L. Falke J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1219-1235Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), voltage-dependent K+ channels (22Cha A. Snyder G.E. Selvin P.R. Bezanilla F. Nature. 1999; 402: 809-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (31Johnson Jr., J.P. Zagotta W.N. Nature. 2001; 412: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), bacteriorhodopsin (32Xiao W. Brown L.S. Needleman R. Lanyi J.K. Shin Y.K. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 715-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), and the mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier (33Kihira Y. Iwahashi A. Majima E. Terada H. Shinohara Y. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 15204-15209Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, we are concerned that the large rotation required to bring the α13′ and α15′ seems significantly larger than what is reasonable to expect for normal motion within a protein. Alternatively, a combination of translational and rotational motion of the M2 segment would reduce the amount of rotational motion necessary to bring the γ214′ and α113′, α115′, and α116′ positions into close proximity (Fig. 5). A sweeping motion of the M2 segment as it translates away from the central channel axis outward toward the outer ring of helices could produce a rotation around an axis other than the helix axis. Such a motion has been proposed for ACh receptor gating (13Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 423: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar, 14Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). Recently, we and others have suggested that the cytoplasmic end of the M2 segment, in the vicinity of the 2′ position, is relatively tightly packed and undergoes little conformational change during gating (19Goren E.N. Reeves D.C. Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11198-11205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 34Panicker S. Cruz H. Arrabit C. Suen K.F. Slesinger P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28149-28158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The extracellular end of the M2 segments may move outward during channel gating, away from the channel axis, whereas the cytoplasmic end could act as a relatively fixed fulcrum. This would open the narrow region of the channel between the 9′ and 14′ positions (13Miyazawa A. Fujiyoshi Y. Unwin N. Nature. 2003; 423: 949-955Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar, 14Unwin N. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 967-989Crossref PubMed Scopus (1418) Google Scholar). All of the disulfide bonds between γ214′ and α113′, α115′, and α116′ formed in the absence of agonist, presumably in the closed resting state of the channel. Thus, even in the resting state the channel-lining M2 segments at the level of the upper end of the putative channel gate are undergoing significant thermal motion. Perhaps in the closed state the M2 segments are spontaneously undergoing a sweeping/rotational motion between their closed and open state conformations, similar to the motion that occurs during channel gating but in a non-concerted fashion. Thus, in the absence of an agonist it is extremely unlikely at any given time that all of the M2 segments would be in the open state position (i.e. spontaneous opening is a very rare event); however, individual M2 segments are constantly but transiently moving into the open state position, resulting in relative motion of adjacent M2 segments in the resting state of the channel. The conformational motion in the channel-lining M2 segments in the closed state may be important for the function of the protein. The channel must open rapidly (35Chakrapani S. Auerbach A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 87-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and with an energy barrier between the closed and open state comparable with the binding energy of two GABA molecules. Thus, if the M2 segments were tightly packed with extensive contacts, the ability to open the channel might be limited. In crystal structures of other proteins it has been shown that the flexibility of a region is inversely proportional to the extent of protein contacts between that region and the rest of the protein (36Halle B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1274-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Thus, the flexibility that is necessary for rapid gating of GABAA receptor channels may require that in the closed state the extent of protein contact between the M2 segments be limited, thus allowing the dynamic motion that we have documented in the present work and previously (19Goren E.N. Reeves D.C. Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11198-11205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Horenstein J. Riegelhaupt P. Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 1573-1581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). It is notable that the disulfide bond formation rates between γ214′ and α113′, α115′, and α116′ were similar in both the absence and the presence of GABA. In the prolonged presence of GABA (∼1 min), most of the channels are in the desensitized state. Thus, the similarity of the disulfide bond formation rates may indicate that the dynamic motion of the M2 segments is similar in the closed and desensitized states. The fraction of time spent in the open state may not be sufficient to change the reaction rate. In contrast, the disulfide bond between γ13′ and α13′ formed three times faster in the presence of GABA. At the 20′ level, the disulfide bond formation rate was also about three times faster in the presence of GABA (17Horenstein J. Wagner D.A. Czajkowski C. Akabas M.H. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 477-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). At present it is unclear why in the same region of the channel the reaction rates for some residues should be similar in both the absence and the presence of GABA, whereas between other pairs of residues the rates should be accelerated in the presence of GABA. This finding suggests that although the extent of thermal motion of the M2 segments in the closed and desensitized states may be similar, the channel structure of these two states may be somewhat different. Regarding the γ213′C to α113′C disulfide bond, we do not know that it is forming between the adjacent subunits. It might be forming between the non-adjacent α subunit and the γ subunit because these are channel-lining residues (10Xu M. Akabas M.H. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 107: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 19Goren E.N. Reeves D.C. Akabas M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 11198-11205Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In addition, we cannot determine whether, in the presence of GABA, this disulfide is forming in the open or desensitized states. Although the Cα-Cα separation distance between γ214′C and α112′C is 8.7 Å, within the range of residues that formed disulfide bonds with γ214′C (TABLE ONE and Fig. 5) we saw no evidence of disulfide bond formation between these engineered cysteine residues. Negative results must be interpreted with care. Disulfide trapping identifies pairs of positions that allow the sulfur atoms in the engineered cysteines to collide with sufficient frequency and energy to allow disulfide bond formation to occur. There are many factors that might prevent a specific pair from colliding with sufficient frequency or in the appropriate orientation to allow measurable rates of disulfide bond formation. In summary, these and previous experiments indicate that the channel-lining M2 segments between the 13′ and 20′ levels undergo continuous spontaneous motion in the closed state. The structure is quite dynamic. This motion appears to involve both rotational and translational components. These movements may be related to the conformational changes that the subunits undergo during channel opening that may involve the rotation of the M2 segments as well as their translation away from the channel axis. The extent of thermal motion is consistent with the loose packing of the extracellular halves of the M2 segments observed in the cryoelectron microscopic structure of the homologous ACh receptor (36Halle B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1274-1279Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Further studies will help to define the specific conformational changes involved in opening the channel gate.

https://openalex.org/W2064053905,"The human and mouse genes that code for the α2 chain of collagen I (COL1A2 and Col1a2, respectively) share a common chromatin structure and nearly identical proximal promoter and far upstream enhancer sequences. Despite these homologies, species-specific differences have been reported regarding the function of individual cis-acting elements, such as the first intron sequence. In the present study, we have investigated the transcriptional contribution of the unique open chromatin site in the first intron of COL1A2 using a transgenic mouse model. DNase I footprinting identified a cluster of three distinct areas of nuclease protection (FI1-3) that span from nucleotides +647 to +760, relative to the transcription start site, and which contain consensus sequences for GATA and interferon regulatory factor (IRF) transcription factors. Gel mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays corroborated this last finding by documenting binding of GATA-4 and IRF-1 and IRF-2 to the first intron sequence. Moreover, a short sequence encompassing the three footprints was found to inhibit expression of transgenic constructs containing the COL1A2 proximal promoter and far upstream enhancer in a position-independent manner. Mutations inserted into each of the footprints restored transgenic expression to different extents. These results therefore indicated that the unique open chromatin site of COL1A2 corresponds to a repressor, the activity of which seems to be mediated by the concerted action of GATA and IRF proteins.

More generally, the study reiterated the existence of species-specific difference in the regulatory networks of the mammalian α2(I) collagen coding genes. The collagens represent a large family of extracellular proteins that impart specific physical properties to tissues, in addition to playing important roles during morphogenesis and growth and in tissue homeostasis and repair (1Hay E.D. Hay, E.D. Cell Biology of the Extracellular Matrix. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York, NY1995: 419-462Google Scholar). Collagen I is the most abundant and most widely distributed collagen type, with high prevalence in bone, skin, teeth, ligaments, and tendons (2Van der Rest M. Garrone R. FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2814-2823Crossref PubMed Scopus (998) Google Scholar). It consists of two α1(I) chains and one α2(I) chain that are produced by two fairly large genes that reside on different chromosomes in both the human and the mouse genome (3Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 7-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Structural mutations in the collagen I chains give rise to manifestations that affect the integrity of multiple organ systems in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (3Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. Ann. Med. 2001; 33: 7-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar). Likewise, excessive deposition of collagen I resulting from dysregulated expression of the corresponding genes (COL1A1 and COL1A2) 3The abbreviations used are:COL1A2 and Col1a2human and mouse α2(I) collagen gene, respectivelyEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayHSDNase I hypersensitive siteHS(In)DNase I-hypersensitive site in the first intron of Col1A2IRFinterferon regulatory factorChIPchromatin immunoprecipitationX-gal5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyo-β-d-galactosidaseIFNinterferonCREBcAMP-response element-binding protein. is the hallmark of many fibrotic disorders that impair the function of affected organs (4Varga J.

Med. 2002; 227: 301-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Expression of the collagen I genes is tightly controlled during development and in a discrete subset of mesenchymal cell types. That collagen I transcripts are found in the same 2:1 ratio as the corresponding chains has been interpreted to suggest that common regulatory programs coordinate expression of the two genes (7Vuust J. Sobel M.E. Martin G.R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 151: 449-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, multiple studies have failed to reveal a common organization of cis-acting elements and cognate trans-acting factors that would be consistent with the notion of shared regulatory programs between the collagen I genes (6Ghosh A.K. Exp. Biol. Med. 2002; 227: 301-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In point of fact, transgenic studies have revealed that the regulatory networks of the mammalian collagen I genes are organized very differently. On the one hand, tissue-specific production of α1(I) collagen chains is under the control of distinct and separate DNA elements scattered throughout the 3.2 kb immediately upstream of the start site of transcription (8Rossert J.

On the other hand, proper α2(I) collagen synthesis is the result of combinatorial interactions among nuclear factors that bind to overlapping DNA motifs clustered within the proximal promoter, as well as between them and those binding to a far upstream enhancer (12Bou-Gharios G.

Chromatin analyses have shown that COL1A2 and Col1a2 share five DNase I hypersensitive sites (HS) within nearly identical sequences of the proximal promoter (HS1), 2.3 kb (HS2) and 20 kb upstream of the transcription start site (HSs 3-5) (12Bou-Gharios G.

Furthermore, studies in transgenic mice have demonstrated that high and tissue-specific expression of both COL1A2 and Col1a2 proximal promoters requires interaction with the upstream sequence containing HSs 3-5, also known as the far upstream enhancer (12Bou-Gharios G.

Deletion experiments have, however, shown that the region around HS5 is dispensable in the mouse but absolutely required in the human transgene (13Antoniv T.T. DeVal S. Wells D. Denton C.P.

Additional analyses have documented that the proximal promoter or the far upstream enhancer of the human, but not of the mouse gene, can by itself drive transgenic expression in osteoblasts (15Tanaka S.

The transcriptional contribution of the first intron sequence is another potential difference between the two species. First, we have identified an open chromatin site, HS(In), that is unique to the first intron of the human gene (13Antoniv T.T. DeVal S. Wells D. Denton C.P. Rabe C. de Crombrugghe B. Ramirez F. Bou-Gharios G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21754-21764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Second, earlier cell transfection experiments had assigned an enhancing activity to the first intron of Col1a2 and an inhibitory role to the COL1A2 counterpart (17Sherwood A.L. Bottenus R.E. Martzen M.R. Bornstein P. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 89: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 18Rossi P. de Crombrugghe B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 5590-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). As part of our effort to delineate the full anatomy of the COL1A2 regulatory network, we have revisited these early studies using the transgenic mouse model in conjunction with DNA binding assays and guided by the knowledge that the intronic sequence contains an open chromatin site (13Antoniv T.T. DeVal S. Wells D. Denton C.P. Rabe C. de Crombrugghe B. Ramirez F. Bou-Gharios G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21754-21764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The results indicate that the sequence harboring HS(In) acts as a strong inhibitor of COL1A2 transcription, thus supporting the earlier contention of Sherwood et al. (17Sherwood A.L. Bottenus R.E. Martzen M.R. Bornstein P. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 89: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Our investigations also mapped relevant cis-acting elements within the HS(In) sequence, identified the cognate trans-acting factors, and demonstrated that full HS(In) repressing activity requires the concerted action of GATA and IRF transcription factors. This study therefore extended the characterization of the major functional elements of the COL1A2 regulatory network, in addition to identifying another species-specific difference between the human and mouse genes. DNA Binding Assays—Nuclear extracts were purified from cultured WI-38 human lung fibroblasts, NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts, or Jurkat T cells according to the previously published protocol (19Truter S. Di Liberto M. Inagaki Y. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25389-25395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For DNase I footprinting assay, a plasmid DNA containing the intron 1 sequence that spans from nucleotides +524 to +895 was cleaved internally with HindIII, end-labeled by filling in 3′-recessed ends with the Klenow enzyme, excised from the plasmid backbone with EcoRI, and incubated with nuclear extracts with or without the addition of DNase I as described previously (19Truter S. Di Liberto M. Inagaki Y. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25389-25395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Likewise, the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) conditions for oligonucleotide end-labeling and incubation with nuclear extracts were essentially the same as described previously (19Truter S. Di Liberto M. Inagaki Y. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25389-25395Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Inagaki Y. Truter S. Ramirez F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14828-14834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In some experiments, nuclear extracts were preincubated with commercial antibodies against GATA or IRF proteins (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), or molar excesses of unlabeled mutant or wild-type oligonucleotides were added to the nuclear extract incubation. Footprinted sequences or DNA-protein complexes were resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography. The chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay was performed on WI-38 cells using a commercial kit (Upstate, Lake Placid, NY) and according to the published protocol (21Smaldone S. Laub F. Else C. Dragomir C. Ramirez F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 1058-1069Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide primers corresponding to +680/+705 and +1074/+1047 (intron-specific) or corresponding to -2472/-2450 and -2358/-2339 (negative control) were employed to PCR-amplify sequence potentially bound by various nuclear proteins. The PCR reaction was performed for a total of 38 cycles after initial denaturation at 93 °C for 3 min; amplification conditions included denaturation at 93 °C for 45 s, annealing at 55 °C (intron-specific) or 47 °C negative control)for 1 min, and elongation at 72 °C for 2 min. One-seventh of the immunoprecipitated genomic fragment was used as a template for amplification, except for the input sample in which 0.01% of the total DNA was used. Results of the ChIP analysis were visualized by Southern blot hybridization to the intron or upstream sequences of the amplification products separated on a 2% agarose gel. Intron sequences from different vertebrate organisms were derived from the Ensemble data base and aligned using the program GeneDoc. Transgenic Constructs—The control LacZ reporter constructs harboring the far upstream enhancer and proximal promoter of COL1A2 have been already described (13Antoniv T.T. DeVal S. Wells D.

Mutant constructs were engineered using PCR amplification to insert single nucleotide substitutions into the various nuclear protein-binding sites of the intronic sequence. Preparation of linearized plasmid DNA for microinjection was according to the standard protocol (22Nagy A. Gertsenstein M. Vintersten K. Behringer R. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2003: 289-358Google Scholar). Generation and Analysis of Transgenic Embryos—Transgenic embryos were produced by the standard pronuclear injection of DNA into fertilized C57Bl/10 × CBA/Ca F1 eggs (22Nagy A. Gertsenstein M. Vintersten K. Behringer R. Manipulating the Mouse Embryo: A Laboratory Manual, 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2003: 289-358Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was digested with appropriate enzymes, purified from agarose gel, and microinjected at a concentration of 2-4 ng/ml in 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 0.1 mm EDTA. Embryos were collected from the recipient females mainly at 15.5 days postcoitum (embryonic day 15.5) for whole mount fixation and staining. This stage was chosen because it is characterized by high Col1a2 activity and to avoid decreased skin permeability due to increased keratinization (12Bou-Gharios G. Garrett L.A. Rossert J. Niederreither K. Eberspaecher H. Smith C. Black C. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Southern blot hybridization and/or PCR amplification of placental DNA were used to assess transgene integration as described previously (12Bou-Gharios G. Garrett L.A. Rossert J. Niederreither K. Eberspaecher H. Smith C. Black C. de Crombrugghe B. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). After cutting open the thorax and abdomen, embryos were placed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and fixed for 45-60 min in 0.2% glutaraldehyde, 2% formalin in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.3, containing 2 mm MgCl2 and EGTA. After three washes of 1 h each in the same buffer supplemented with 0.1% sodium deoxycholate and 0.2% Nonidet P-40, embryos were stained overnight at room temperature in 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyo-β-d-galactosidase (X-gal) solution containing 5 mm potassium ferrocyanide and 5 mm ferricyanide. For histology, X-gal-positive embryos were dehydrated and wax-embedded, and 6-μm tissue sections were prepared, dewaxed, and counterstained with eosin. The data presented are from embryos with comparable numbers of transgenic inserts, 2-5. Early cell transfection experiments have shown that the first intron of Col1a2 and COL1A2 stimulates and inhibits transcription, respectively (17Sherwood A.L. Bottenus R.E. Martzen M.R. Bornstein P.

These studies were, however, performed using long intronic sequences (1.2-1.7 kb) and without prior knowledge of the precise location of relevant cis-acting element(s). Subsequent analyses of chromatin structure located a unique DNase-sensitive site, termed HS(In), at about +730 in the first intron of COL1A2 and within an evolutionarily divergent sequence (13Antoniv T.T. DeVal S. Wells D. Denton C.P. Rabe C. de Crombrugghe B. Ramirez F. Bou-Gharios G. J. Biol.

Gene (Amst.). 1990; 89: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The present study was designed to characterize this putative regulatory element of COL1A2 using transgenic mice in combination with DNA binding assays. Accordingly, the DNase I footprinting assays were first performed on a genomic fragment spanning from nucleotides +524 to +801 to map sites of nuclear protein interaction around HS(In). The analysis located a cluster of three clearly distinct footprinted areas within the HS(In) encompassing region, which were designated FI1 (+647/+676), FI2 (+696/+734), and FI3 (+746/+760) (Fig. 1A). Radiolabeled oligonucleotides containing each of the footprinted areas were then used in the EMSA to confirm binding of nuclear proteins. The EMSA revealed formation of specific retarded bands with each of the three probes (Fig. 2). A computer-aided inspection of the footprinted areas identified potential binding sites for transcription factors GATA (FI1 and FI2) and IRF (FI3) (Fig. 1B). Wild-type and mutant forms of these recognition sites were therefore tested in competition assays against the respective labeled probes. The resulting EMSAs documented the ability of the wild-type oligonucleotides and the inability of the mutant sequences to affect complex formation (Fig. 2). Cross-species sequence alignment of the relevant intron elements revealed only a modest level of sequence homology and loss of most of the GATA- and IRF-binding sites identified in the human gene (Fig. 1C).FIGURE 2Gel mobility shift assays of the HS(In) footprints. Labeled oligonucleotides corresponding to the sequences of FI1, FI2, and FI3 were incubated with nuclear extracts purified from NIH-3T3 with or without molar excesses (50-100-fold) of unlabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to wild-type (wt) and mutant (mt) versions of the original probes and the wild-type or mutant GATA (Gwt and Gmt) and IRF (Iwt and Imt) consensus sequences, as well as preincubation with antibodies (α) against the indicated transcription factors. Symbols indicate retarded (arrow) or supershifted (arrowhead) complexes and nonspecific bands (asterisk).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Additional EMSAs using specific antibodies confirmed that GATA and IRF proteins indeed bind to the FI1 and FI2 sequences and to the FI3 sequence, respectively. Specifically, the assays showed that the FI1 and FI2 probes bind GATA-4 and not GATA-1, whereas probe FI3 recognized both IRF-2 and IRF-1 (Fig. 2). That the IRF-1 antibodies reduced FI3 complex formation without yielding a supershift could be accounted for by unspecific antibody interference. However, lack of IRF-1 antibody interference with Jurkat nuclear extracts excluded this possibility (Fig. 3A). Consistent with the differential distribution of the two GATA proteins (23Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38949-38952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar), the specificity of the FI2 complex was indirectly corroborated by the finding that GATA-2 and GATA-3 or GATA-4 bind to FI2 in Jurkat T-cells and fibroblasts, respectively (Fig. 3A). The same results were obtained with the IF1 probe (data not shown). These in vitro binding assays were confirmed in vivo by ChIP analysis of human lung fibroblasts. Sequence-specific PCR amplification of genomic DNA immunoprecipitated with antibodies against GATA-4, IRF-1, or IRF-2, but not with unspecific antibodies, yielded reproducibly positive signals when hybridized to the HS(In) probe (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, specificity of in vivo binding was independently confirmed by lack of positive signals in a parallel control sample in which the ChIP assay was performed with an upstream sequence of COL1A2 (Fig. 3B). Preliminary evidence also suggested that a potential CREB/AP1 recognition sequence in FI2 binds c-Jun (data not shown). Having determined the precise location of the HS(In) element and the identity of the interacting nuclear factors, the next experiments examined its functional contribution to COL1A2 transcription. Transient transfections using a 372-bp intronic sequence (+524 to +895) inclusive of the HS(In) element showed a slight down-regulation of the -378 promoter activity, consistent with the earlier notion of a repressing activity of the COL1A2 intron (data not shown) (17Sherwood A.L. Bottenus R.E. Martzen M.R. Bornstein P. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 89: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Based on this preliminary evidence, the transgenic model was then employed to examine the HS(In) element within the in vivo context and in relationship to the interaction between the proximal promoter and far upstream enhancer. Transgenic constructs included the original 21.1/18.8pLAC plasmid, which contains the core sequence of the far upstream enhancer and the -378 proximal promoter (13Antoniv T.T. DeVal S. Wells D. Denton C.P. Rabe C. de Crombrugghe B. Ramirez F. Bou-Gharios G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21754-21764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and a modification of 21.1/18.8pLAC in which the wild-type 372-bp segment containing the HS(In) element had been inserted downstream of the reporter gene (21.1/18.8pLAC-In) or between the far upstream enhancer and proximal promoter (21.1/18.8(In)pLAC) (Fig. 4). Several 21.1/18.8pLAC-In founders were generated, and all showed lower β-galactosidase staining in most tissues when compared with embryos harboring the intronless 21.1/18.8pLAC transgene (Fig. 5, A and B). Histological sections demonstrated that β-galactosidase staining in different transgenics, albeit variable in intensity, was always confined to collagen I-producing cells (Fig. 5, D-I). Overall, the intensity and distribution of X-gal staining in the 21.1/18.8pLAC-In transgene was reminiscent of the pattern observed previously with the proximal promoter transgene without the far upstream enhancer (13Antoniv T.T. DeVal S. Wells D. Denton C.P. Rabe C. de Crombrugghe B. Ramirez F. Bou-Gharios G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21754-21764Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Limited staining was seen in some ossification centers of intramembranous bones (Fig. 5, H and I) and in patches of skin fascia and tendon (Fig. 5G), as well as in a few internal organs, such as the forming kidney and spleen (Fig. 5, D and F). By contrast, no staining was detected in the lung, heart, gut, and blood vessels (Fig. 5E). Similar results were obtained with 21.1/18.8(In)pLAC, the construct in which the intronic sequence had been inserted between the enhancer and the promoter (Fig. 5C). Together, these findings demonstrated the inhibitory effect of the HS(In) sequence on COL1A2 transcription.FIGURE 5Functional analysis of HS(In) in transgenic mice. Whole mount X-gal staining of illustrative embryonic day 15.5 embryos harboring the 21.8/18.8pLAC (A), 21.1/18.8pLAC-In (B), or 21.1/18.8(In)pLAC transgenes (C) is shown. X-gal staining of tissue sections from 21.1/18.8pLAC-In transgenic embryos showing β-galactosidase activity in a few collagen I-producing cells, such as those in the splenic primordium (D, s) and around the vertebra but not in blood vessels (E, s), is shown. Positive mesenchymal cells of the developing kidney and tendons are shown in F and G, respectively. A few osteoblasts are positively stained (arrows) in the parietal bone (H) and maxillary gland (I).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Based on the above findings, we assessed the contribution of individual nuclear protein-binding sites to HS(in) inhibition of 21.1/18.8pLAC expression by examining β-galactosidase activity in transgenic mouse embryos harboring mutated versions of FI1, FI2, or FI3. The mutations included nucleotide substitutions in the binding sites of each footprint (21.1/18.8pLAC-Inm1, 21.1/18.8pLAC-Inm2, and 21.1/18.8pLAC-Inm3) and in the GATA-binding sites of both FI1 and FI2 (21.1/18.8pLAC-Inm1,2) (Fig. 4). X-gal staining revealed comparable β-galactosidase levels that were similar to that of the intronless 21.1/18.8pLAC transgene (Fig. 6, A-D). They also identified a few interesting differences among the four mutant transgenes. First, X-gal staining in the skin and other tissues of the 21.1/18.8pLAC-Inm1 and 21.1/18.8pLAC-Inm2 transgene was lower than in 21.1/18.8pLAC-Inm3 embryos (Fig. 6, A, B, and D). The sole exception was the unusually strong β-galactosidase activity in 21.1/18.8pLAC-Inm1 and 21.1/18.8pLAC-Inm2 bones (Fig. 6, K and L). In point of fact, this was the strongest X-gal staining ever recorded in bone with any of the COL1A2 constructs examined in this and previous studies (13Antoniv T.T. DeVal S. Wells D. Denton C.P.

Wells D.J. Ramirez F. Bou-Gharios G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 56024-56031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Second, LacZ gene expression in internal organs of the 21.1/18.8pLAC-Inm2 transgene was consistently higher than it was for the 21.1/18.8pLAC-Inm1 construct (data not shown). Third, the combination of both GATA mutations (21.1/18.8pLAC-Inm1,2) yielded the same level of X-gal staining as the mutation of only the IRF-binding site (21.1/18.8pLAC-Inm3) and was the closest to that of the intronless control transgene (Fig. 6, C and D). Several founders harboring transgenes with m1, m2, and m3 mutations were sectioned and examined histologically. This revealed intense β-galactosidase activity in all type I collagen-producing cells, such as skin fascia fibroblasts (Fig. 6E), skeletal muscle cells, and tendon and blood vessels (Fig. 6H). High level staining was also noted in gut, lung, pancreas, and splenic primordium (Fig. 6, F-I). Collectively, these results indicated that full repressor activity requires the participation of all nuclear protein-binding sites and that each of them may play a more prominent role within individual cellular contexts. In summary, the present study has demonstrated for the first time that the HS(In) element is a strong repressor of COL1A2 transcription in vivo. This conclusion was based on the ability of a short HS(In) containing sequence to inhibit the activity of an experimental model that closely replicates the expression pattern of COL1A2 in transgenic mice. Within the limitations of this in vivo model, our result supports Sherwood et al. (17Sherwood A.L. Bottenus R.E. Martzen M.R. Bornstein P. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 89: 239-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) cell transfection data and reiterates the existence of functional differences in the organization of the regulatory network of the Col1a2 and COL1A2 genes. As such, it underscored the peril of extrapolating functional conclusions from one mammalian species to another. The EMSA and the ChIP assay have correlated the inhibitory activity of the HS(In) sequence with the specific binding of GATA and IRF proteins to three nearly juxtaposed elements. Moreover, transgenic experiments have demonstrated that inhibition requires the full complement of nuclear protein-binding sites. They have also raised the possibility that each of the cis-acting HS(In) elements imparts slightly different properties to the inhibitory protein complex. GATA proteins represent a small family of zinc finger transcriptional regulators that are expressed in hematopoietic stem cells (GATAs 1-3) and in a variety of mesoderm- and endoderm-derived tissues (GATAs 4-6) (23Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38949-38952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Consistent with the tissue distribution of GATA family members, we observed binding of GATA-4 and GATAs 2 and 3 with nuclear extracts from NIH-3T3 and Jurkat cells, respectively. GATA proteins have been reported to modulate tissue-specific gene expression across various cell types by interacting with a large array of transcriptional activators and repressors (23Molkentin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38949-38952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar). Along these lines, we recently found that the HS2 element of COL1A2 is another GATA-binding site that represses transcription from the -378 promoter (24Wang L. Tanaka S. Ramirez F. Matrix Biol. 2005; 23: 333-340Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It is therefore conceivable to argue that combinatorial interactions among GATA proteins and co-factors at different COL1A2 sites may orchestrate expression of this mesenchyme-specific gene within different cellular contexts. Originally identified as transcriptional repressors or activators of interferon-β (IFN-β) and of IFN-γ-inducible genes, IRFs have later emerged as broader regulators of other biological processes, such as cell growth, in conjunction with other nuclear proteins (25Mamane Y. Heylbroeck C. Genin P. Algarte M. Servant M.J. LePage C. DeLuca C. Kwon H. Lin R. Hiscott J. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 237: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). A case in point is IRF-2, which has been shown to repress IFN-β activation by coactivator repulsion (26Senger K. Merika M. Agalioti T. Yie J. Escalante C.R. Chen G. Aggarwal A.K. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 931-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In this novel regulatory mechanism, incorporation of IRF-2 into the enhanceosome prevents recruitment of the CREB-binding protein and RNA polymerase II holoenzyme complex through a specific protein domain. Similar to the relatively higher activity of 21.1/18.8pLAC-Inm3 when compared with the other mutant transgenes in most collagen I-producing tissues, inactivation of IRF-2 in mice has been shown to expand the number of cells that respond to viral infection by inducing IFN-β gene transcription (26Senger K. Merika M. Agalioti T. Yie J. Escalante C.R. Chen G. Aggarwal A.K. Thanos D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 931-937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although our study did not address whether a similar mechanism may operate in COL1A2, it nonetheless suggested that other factors that normally counteract HS(In) repression in collagen I-producing cells are not present in the transgenic model used as our experimental readout. Among others, probable modulating factors include additional sequences and cognate trans-acting factors and/or appropriate spacing of the interacting domains in the regulatory network (27Ogbourne S. Antalis T.M. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Work in progress is characterizing the precise mechanism of the transcriptional repression by the intronic elements and the identity of the trans-acting factors involved in this process. It is also exploring the possibility that HS(In) may contain another interferon-responsive element of the COL1A2 gene.

Tryptophan phosphorescence spectroscopy is one of the most sensitive methods used for detecting conformational changes in proteins. We employed this technique to study substrate-induced conformational changes in the mannitol permease, EnzymeIImtl, of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system from Escherichia coli. Ten mutants containing a single tryptophan were engineered in the membrane-embedded IICmtl-domain, harboring the mannitol translocation pathway. The mutants were characterized with respect to steady-state and time-resolved phosphorescence, yielding detailed, site-specific information of the Trp microenvironment and protein conformational homogeneity. The study revealed that the Trp environments vary from apolar, unstructured, and flexible sites to buried, highly homogeneous, rigid peptide cores. The most remarkable example of the latter was observed for position 97, because its long sub-second phosphorescence lifetime and highly structured spectra in both glassy and fluid media imply a well defined and rigid core around the probe that is typical of β-sheet-rich structural motifs. The addition of mannitol had a large impact on most of the Trp positions studied. In the case of position 97, mannitol binding induced partial unfolding of the rigid protein core. On the contrary, for residue positions 126, 133, and 147, both steady-state and time-resolved data showed that mannitol binding induces a more ordered and homogeneous structure around these residues.

Acta. 1999; 1422: 73-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). EIImtl consists of three covalently linked domains (from N to C termini): a membrane-embedded IICmtl-domain harboring the mannitol-translocation pathway (2Grisafi P.L. Scholle A. Sugiyama J. Briggs C. Jacobson G.R. Lengeler J.W. J. Bacteriol. 1989; 171: 2719-2727Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and two cytosolic domains (IIBmtl and IIAmtl) responsible for phosphoryl transfer. EIImtl becomes phosphorylated via a cascade of phosphoryl group-transfer reactions, starting with the hydrolysis of phosphoenolpyruvate by the cytosolic kinase EnzymeI (EI). The phosphate moiety from phosphorylated EI is transferred to HPr, a small cytosolic protein. Subsequently, His-554 in the IIAmtl-domain is phosphorylated by P-HPr, and transfers the phosphate to Cys-384 in the IIBmtl-domain. The phosphate is then donated to mannitol bound at the IICmtl-domain, resulting in the release of mannitol 1-phosphate in the cytoplasm. Phosphorylation of EIImtl activates the carrier, resulting in a two-to-three orders of magnitude increase in the transport rate (3Elferink M.G.L. Driessen A.J.M. Robillard G.T. J.

A phoA fusion study and hydropathy analysis of the IICmtl-domain resulted in a topology model with three small periplasmic loops, two large cytoplasmic loops, and six putative membrane-spanning helices (6Sugiyama J.E. Mahmoodian S. Jacobson G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9603-9607Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that both large cytoplasmic loops fold back into the membrane-embedded part of the protein, lining up a hydrophilic pathway for the translocation of the carbohydrate (7Lengeler J.W. Jahrkreis K. Wehmeier U.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1188: 1-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). New structural insight on the basis of cysteine-scanning mutagenesis in the first proposed cytoplasmic loop provided evidence for the presence of this loop protruding, at least partly, into the bilayer (8Vervoort E.B. Bultema J.B. Schuurman-Wolters G.K. Geertsma E.R. Broos J. Poolman B. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 733-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For the subcloned IICmtl-domain, a two-dimensional projection structure at 5-Å resolution was determined by electron microscopy crystallography (9Koning R.I. Keegstra W. Oostergetel G.T. Schuurman-Wolters G.K. Robillard G.T. Brisson A. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 287: 845-851Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Six regions of high density were found, possibly reflecting six membrane-spanning helices. Of the available spectroscopic techniques, Trp phosphorescence spectroscopy is one of the most sensitive approaches used to study changes in protein conformation, due to the extremely slow (radiative) de-excitation rate of the triplet excited state (∼0.2 s–1). This makes Trp phosphorescence 108 times more sensitive for quenching processes than Trp fluorescence. A conformational change, nearby or more remote from the Trp probe, is expected to induce a different quenching pattern on this time scale, and thus a change in the phosphorescence lifetime (τP). The observation of multiple τP values for a single Trp position reflects the presence of different protein conformational states, which do not rapidly interchange on the time scale of τP. The ability to quench the Trp triplet state is governed by the local viscosity (η), and the relation between τP and η is well established (10Strambini G.B. Gonnelli M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1995; 117: 7646-7651Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 11Gonnelli M. Strambini G.B. Photochem. Photobiol. 2005; 81: 614-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The information obtained by measuring τP, combined with the recording of emission spectra of the protein in both the glass-state and in the fluid state, provides site-specific, structural information about the Trp microviscosity (η), micropolarity, and protein conformational heterogeneity. Together with fluorescence, phosphorescence can distinguish whether a residue is placed in a superficial, mobile, and solvent-exposed location in the protein or when it is in a buried and rigid part. The wild-type EIImtl protein has four Trp residues all located in the membrane-embedded IICmtl-domain. The fluorescence and phosphorescence characteristics of single-Trp mutants have pointed toward a large variation in polypeptide structure among the sites 30, 42, 109, and 117, as well a distinct response to the binding of mannitol and phosphorylation (12Swaving-Dijkstra D.

The positions in the proposed topology model are helix II (Trp-66), a loop protruding the membrane (Trp-97), the following cytoplasmic loop (Trp-114 and Trp-126), helix III (Trp-133 and Trp-147), helix IV (Trp-167), and the following loop (Trp-188 and Trp-198). Prominent among the findings reported here is the presence of an unexpectedly rigid, presumably β-sheet-rich segment in the loop between helices II and III, protruding into the lipid bilayer. More surprisingly, this structural part becomes largely unfolded upon binding of the substrate mannitol. There appeared to be no influence of the IIBAmtl-domain on the structural characteristics of this part of the protein, as inferred from observations with IIC-Trp-97, lacking the cytoplasmic domains. Furthermore, the region from residues 125 to 150 becomes more structured upon mannitol binding. Chemicals and Reagents—d-[1-3H]Mannitol (17.0 Ci/mmol, batch 3499-326) was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. d-[1-14C]Mannitol (59.0 mCi/mmol, batch 78) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Radioactivity measurements were performed using Emulsifier Scintillator Plus obtained from Packard (Groningen, The Netherlands). Q-Sepharose and SP-Sepharose Fast Flow were from Amersham Biosciences. Ni-NTA resin was from Qiagen Inc. l-Histidine (spectroscopic grade) and imidazole were from Fluka. NaCl (Suprapure) was from Merck, Darmstadt, Germany. For phosphorescence measurements, water, doubly distilled over quartz, was purified by the Milli-Q Plus system (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Spectroscopic grade 1,2-propylene glycol (PG) was from Merck. Decylpoly(ethylene glycol) 300 (decylPEG) was obtained from Kwant High Vacuum Oil Recycling and Synthesis, Bedum, The Netherlands. C10E5 (decyl pentaethylene glycol ether) was synthesized and purified as described previously (12Swaving-Dijkstra D. Broos J. Lolkema J.S. Enequist H. Minke W. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6628-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). n-Decyl-β-d-maltopyranoside, Anagrade, was from Anatrace. All other chemicals were of the highest purity grade available from commercial sources. His-tagged versions of EI and HPr were created using standard genetic tools as will be described elsewhere. Construction of Single-Trp Mutants—The construction of the functional Trp-less EIImtl (TL) construct with a N-terminal His6 tag will be published elsewhere. 6E. P. P. Vos, manuscript in preparation. In this construct all four native Trp residues at positions 30, 42, 109, and 117 were replaced with phenylalanines. The mutations resulting in the single-Trp mutants using TL as a basis (Trp-66, Trp-97, Trp-114, Trp-126, Trp-133, Trp-147, Trp-167, Trp-188, and Trp-198) were introduced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. In each mutant a phenylalanine was replaced with a Trp, except for Trp-66, where a tyrosine was mutated into a Trp. The sequences were confirmed by nucleotide sequence analysis. The IICmtl mutants were constructed by cutting the plasmids harboring the wild-type IICmtl-His6 (with a C-terminal His6 tag) (17Meijberg W. Schuurman-Wolters G.K. Boer H. Scheek R.M. Robillard G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20785-20794Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and TL and Trp-97 (EII constructs; see above), with restriction enzymes BbvC1 and Eco47III (at amino acid positions 15 and 237, respectively). The 665-bp fragment was isolated from the TL and Trp-97 mutants and ligated into the wild-type IICmtl-His6 plasmid, without this 665-bp fragment, yielding IIC-Trp-97, and IIC-TL, respectively. Cell Growth, Isolation of Inside-out Membrane Vesicles, and Protein Purification—The plasmids harboring the single-Trp-mutated mtlA genes (pMamtlaPrHis6EIItl-F→ W or pMamtlaPrIICtl-F→ W-His6) were transformed and subsequently grown in bacterial strain E. coli LGS322 (F– thi-1, hisG1, argG6, metB1, tonA2, supE44, rspL104, lacY1, galT6, gatR49, gatA50, Δ(mtlA′p), mtlDc, Δ(gutR′MDBA-recA)) as described before (18Boer H. Ten Hoeve-Duurkens R.H. Schuurman-Wolters G.K. Dijkstra A. Robillard G.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17863-17871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inside-out membrane vesicles were prepared by passage of the cells through a French Press at 10.000 p.s.i., essentially as described (19Broos J. Ter Veld F. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9798-9803Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The membrane vesicles were washed once in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm dithiothreitol, plus 1 mm NaN3, and quickly frozen in small aliquots in liquid nitrogen prior to storage at –80 °C. Membrane vesicles used for experiments were placed at 37 °C for quick thawing and directly placed on ice until further used. All single-Trp EIImtl mutants were purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography as described (20Veldhuis G. Broos J. Poolman B. Scheek R.M. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 201-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). To remove all traces of the tryptophan phosphorescence quencher histidine (used to elute the protein from Ni-NTA) from the EIImtl mutant preparations, pooled Ni-NTA fractions were diluted 5 times in buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 2 mm reduced glutathione, plus 0.25% C10E5), loaded onto Q-Sepharose, washed with 20 column volumes of the same buffer, and subsequently eluted in a single step using 4 column volumes of the above buffer, supplemented with 400 mm NaCl (Suprapur, Merck). All fluorescence and phosphorescence measurements were performed using this buffer. The Trp-less IIC-TL and single-Trp IIC-Trp-97 mutants were purified using a somewhat different strategy. Briefly, membrane vesicles (of ∼20 mg/ml total membrane protein), harboring the overproduced IIC mutants, were solubilized at ∼2 mg/ml in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 400 mm NaCl, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 1% (w/v) n-decyl-β-d-maltopyranoside, plus 10 mm imidazole for 15 min at room temperature. After spinning down the non-solubilized material (10 min, 250,000 × g, 4 °C), the supernatant was mixed with washed Ni-NTA resin by stirring for 1 h at 4 °C. After draining the flow-through, the column was subsequently washed with 10 column volumes buffer A (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 200 mm NaCl, 0.35% decylPEG, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, plus 10 mm imidazole), and 10 column volumes buffer B (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% decylPEG, plus 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The His-tagged IICmtl mutants were batch-wise eluted from Ni-NTA with 80 mm l-histidine (in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mm NaCl, 0.25% decylPEG, plus 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). To remove the histidine, the same purification procedure as for the single-tryptophan EIImtl mutants was followed, using SP-Sepharose instead of Q-Sepharose. For both the EIImtl- and IICmtl mutants, purification resulted in suitable protein samples for phosphorescence spectroscopy, typically at protein concentrations ranging from 5–15 μm. Protein purity of the samples was confirmed with SDS-PAGE analysis, and estimated to be >95%. Mannitol Binding and Phosphorylation—Mannitol binding to detergent-solubilized membrane proteins was performed as described (21Veldhuis G. Vos E.P.P. Broos J. Poolman B. Scheek R.M. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 1959-1968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The non-vectorial phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation activity of EIImtl was measured as described (22Robillard G.T. Blaauw M. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 5796-5803Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, the assay mixture contained 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm phosphoenolpyrurate, 350 nm EI, 17 μm HPr, with or without 0.25% decylPEG, and rate-limiting amounts of EIImtl (nanomolar regime). After incubation of the mixture for 5 min at 30 °C, the reaction was started by adding 1 mm [14C]mannitol. The reaction was quenched at given time intervals by loading the samples on Dowex AG1-X2 columns (1 ml of resin). After washing the column with 4 column volumes of H2O, formed [14C]mannitol-1-phosphate was eluted using 2 column volumes of 0.2 n HCl and quantified by liquid scintillation counting. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—For the purification of EIImtl and IICmtl, care was taken to minimize fluorescent impurities in all used buffers (23Swaving-Dijkstra D. Broos J. Robillard G.T. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Steady-state measurements were performed on a Fluorolog3-22 spectrofluorometer (Jovin Yvon) at 20 °C. Excitation was at 295 nm with an excitation slit width of 2 nm and an emission slit width of 5 nm. All spectra were corrected for background fluorescence of the used buffers and instrument response. The changes in fluorescence after addition of 1mm mannitol were calculated by integration of the spectra from 305–399 nm. Phosphorescence Spectroscopy—For phosphorescence measurements in fluid solutions, O2 removal was achieved by the alternative application of moderate vacuum and inlet of ultrapure N2 (24Strambini G.B. Kerwin A.B. Mason D.B. Gonnelli M. Photochem. Photobiol. 2004; 80: 462-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The samples were placed in specially designed T-shaped spectrosil quartz cuvettes (4-mm inner diameter round tubing in the optical section, Hellma, Mullheim/Baden, Germany) and rocked very gently, because of the surfactant, for about 10 min to achieve complete exchange of O2 for N2. The cuvette was connected to the N2/vacuum line by peek tubing (1/16 inch), and the sample was fully isolated from the atmosphere by a septum (Hamilton 76003, Alltech, Lancashire, UK) plus O-ring seal assembly (24Strambini G.B. Kerwin A.B. Mason D.B. Gonnelli M. Photochem. Photobiol. 2004; 80: 462-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Based on the phosphorescence lifetime of the protein alcohol dehydrogenase from horse liver, which exhibits one of the highest sensitivities to O2 quenching, this procedure lowered the O2 level <2nm. Phosphorescence spectra and decays were both measured with pulsed excitation (λex = 288 nm) on a customized apparatus (24Strambini G.B. Kerwin A.B. Mason D.B. Gonnelli M. Photochem. Photobiol. 2004; 80: 462-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), modified to implement spectral measurements by means of a charge-coupled device camera. Pulsed excitation was provided by a frequency-doubled Nd/Yag-pumped dye laser (Quanta Systems, Milan, Italy) with pulse duration of 5 ns and a typical energy per pulse of 0.5–1 mJ. For spectra measurements the emission was collected at 90° from the excitation and dispersed by a 0.3-m focal length triple grating imaging spectrograph (SpectraPro-2300i, Acton Research Corp., Acton, MA) with a band pass ranging from 1.0 to 0.2 nm. The emission was monitored by a back-illuminated 1340-× 400-pixels charge-coupled device camera (Princeton Instruments, Spec-10:400B(XTE), Roper Scientific Inc., Trenton, NJ) cooled to –60 °C. In low temperature glasses, the phosphorescence spectrum of Trp was overlapped by a relatively intense background from solvent impurities and tyrosinate, an emission that decayed to negligible levels during the initial 3–4 s from the excitation pulse. Background-free Trp spectra were obtained by opening the mechanical shutter controlling the emission to the spectrograph after a delay of 3 s. In fluid solutions, where the lifetime of Trp phosphorescence is much shorter than the 6 s in glassy media, spectra were recorded by integrating multiple excitation pulses at a repetition frequency up to 10 Hz. To block overlapping prompt fluorescence and short-lived background from the detector, laser excitation was synchronized to a fast mechanical chopper opening the emission slit 35 μs after the laser pulse. In general, even with the shortest-lived protein phosphorescence less than 100 pulses was sufficient to obtain satisfactory signal-to-noise ratios. Besides averaging multiple pulses, the signal-to-noise ratio of very weak signals, which are characterized by relatively broad spectra, was further improved by horizontal binning of channels (2–4 channels), with no effect on spectral resolution. Under these extreme conditions the background signal, represented by a broad band peaked around 500 nm, was not negligible and was subtracted from the total spectrum, by using the spectrum of a TL control. Phosphorescence decays were monitored by collecting the emission at 90° from vertical excitation through a filter combination with a transmission window of 405–445 nm (WG405, Lot-Oriel, Milan, Italy; plus interference filter DT-Blau, Balzer, Milan, Italy). The photomultiplier (EMI 9235QA, Middlesex, UK) was protected against fatigue from the strong excitation/fluorescence pulse by a mechanical chopper synchronized to the laser trigger, which closed the emission slit during the excitation pulse. The time resolution of this apparatus depends on the chopper speed and for the experiments reported here was maintained constant to 35 μs, the same as for spectral acquisitions. The photocurrent was amplified by a current-to-voltage converter (SR570, Stanford Research Systems, Stanford, CA) and digitized by a computerscope system (ISC-16, RC Electronics, Santa Barbara, CA) capable of averaging multiple sweeps. Typically, less than 100 sweeps was sufficient even for the shortest decays. The background emission, as determined by measurements carried out on a TL protein and on the surfactant-containing buffer, made an important contribution during the first 200–250 μs. Therefore, phosphorescence lifetimes shorter than 200 μs could not be determined accurately, and only the amplitudes of these short components could be estimated from the fluorescence-normalized phosphorescence intensities (24Strambini G.B. Kerwin A.B. Mason D.B. Gonnelli M. Photochem. Photobiol. 2004; 80: 462-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To this end, parallel measurements were made of the intensity of prompt fluorescence from each excitation pulse. Prompt fluorescence was collected through a 310–375 bandpass filter combination (WG305 nm plus Schott UG11) and detected by a UV-enhanced photodiode (OSD100-7, Centronics, Newbury Park, CA). An analogue circuit was used to integrate the photocurrent, and its output was digitized and averaged by a multifunctional board (PCI-20428, Intelligent Instrumentation, Tucson, Texas) utilizing Lab View software. The prompt fluorescence intensity was used to account for possible variations in the laser output between phosphorescence and background measurements as well as to obtain fluorescence-normalized phosphorescence intensities. All phosphorescence decays were analyzed in terms of a sum of exponential components by a non-linear least squares fitting algorithm (Global Unlimited, LFD, University of Illinois). The Trp-less and single-Trp EII and IIC mutants were tested for mannitol binding, and the results are summarized in TABLE ONE. All mutants bound mannitol with high affinity in the nanomolar range, comparable to the wild-type protein (21Veldhuis G. Vos E.P.P. Broos J. Poolman B. Scheek R.M. Biophys. J. 2004; 86: 1959-1968Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), except Trp-198 (KD of 375 nm), Trp-97, and IIC-Trp-97, which showed a significant decreased binding affinity with KD values of ∼2 μm. The phosphorylation activities in intact membrane vesicles were more or less the same for all EII mutants and comparable to wild-type and TL (12Swaving-Dijkstra D. Broos J. Lolkema J.S. Enequist H. Minke W. Robillard G.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 6628-6634Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), indicating the functionality of all mutants. Phosphorylation activity for the IIC mutants could not be measured, because they lack the IIBAmtl-domains for phosphoryl-group transfer.TABLE ONEMannitol binding properties of the single-tryptophan mutantsMutantKDaDetergent-solubilized membrane vesicles; the errors in KD are typically below 10% (21).nmEIImtl-TL70 Trp-66141 Trp-971950 Trp-11459 Trp-126105 Trp-13364 Trp-147160 Trp-16734 Trp-18830 Trp-198375IICmtl-TL358 Trp-972230a Detergent-solubilized membrane vesicles; the errors in KD are typically below 10% (21Veldhuis G.

Except for the glass-state measurements at 140 K (see “Materials and Methods”), the low background contribution of the TL proteins (both for EII and IIC) was not significantly different from that of the buffer and allowed us to correct the signals for the generally small contribution of the background.
