https://openalex.org/W3200715289,"Estrogen receptor α (ERα) is a hormone receptor and key driver for over 70% of breast cancers that has been studied for decades as a transcription factor. Unexpectedly, we discover that ERα is a potent non-canonical RNA-binding protein. We show that ERα RNA binding function is uncoupled from its activity to bind DNA and critical for breast cancer progression. Employing genome-wide cross-linking immunoprecipitation (CLIP) sequencing and a functional CRISPRi screen, we find that ERα-associated mRNAs sustain cancer cell fitness and elicit cellular responses to stress. Mechanistically, ERα controls different steps of RNA metabolism. In particular, we demonstrate that ERα RNA binding mediates alternative splicing of XBP1 and translation of the eIF4G2 and MCL1 mRNAs, which facilitates survival upon stress conditions and sustains tamoxifen resistance of cancer cells. ERα is therefore a multifaceted RNA-binding protein, and this activity transforms our knowledge of post-transcriptional regulation underlying cancer development and drug response."

IntroductionMitochondria possess crucial roles in metabolism and signaling that ensure tissue formation and homeostasis (Chandel, 2015Chandel N.S.

Mitochondria as intracellular signaling platforms in health and disease.J. Cell Biol. 2020; 219: e202002179Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Central among their many functions is oxidative phosphorylation, which produces ATP to sustain a cell’s energy balance (Lisowski et al., 2018Lisowski P. Kannan P. Mlody B. Prigione A. Mitochondria and the dynamic control of stem cell homeostasis.EMBO Rep. 2018; 19: e45432Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Because ATP requirements can change, cells must constantly adjust oxidative phosphorylation to their needs, as illustrated by differentiating cells that activate mitochondrial ATP synthesis to fulfill the escalating energy demands of cell fate specification (Beckervordersandforth et al., 2017Beckervordersandforth R. Ebert B. Schäffner I. Moss J. Fiebig C. Shin J. Moore D.L. Ghosh L. Trinchero M.F.

Dysregulation of oxidative phosphorylation accordingly impedes development (Gorman et al., 2016Gorman G.S. Chinnery P.F. DiMauro S. Hirano M. Koga Y. McFarland R. Suomalainen A. Thorburn D.R. Zeviani M. Turnbull D.M. Mitochondrial diseases.Nat. Rev. Dis. Primers. 2016; 2: 16080Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), yet how this process is tuned to the necessities of tissue formation and homeostasis is still incompletely understood.In addition to ATP, oxidative phosphorylation yields reactive oxygen species (ROS) as invariant byproducts. Mutations in components of the electron transport chain, abrupt changes in the rate of oxidative phosphorylation, or environmental toxins can increase ROS to levels that damage proteins, lipids, or DNA (Sies et al., 2017Sies H. Berndt C. Jones D.P. Oxidative Stress.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2017; 86: 715-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (1458) Google Scholar). If unmitigated, such oxidative stress exhausts stem cell populations, accelerates aging, and results in cancer or neurodegeneration (Corenblum et al., 2016Corenblum M.J. Ray S. Remley Q.W. Long M.

Cells sense oxidative stress through the E3 ligase CUL3KEAP1, which is inhibited by ROS-dependent oxidation of Cys residues in KEAP1 (Dinkova-Kostova et al., 2002Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Holtzclaw W.D.

Inhibition of CUL3KEAP1 prevents the degradation of the transcription factor NRF2 and thereby instigates an antioxidant gene expression program.While overabundant ROS elicit oxidative stress, their persistent depletion leads to the opposite condition known as reductive stress (Gores et al., 1989Gores G.J.

Cells detect reductive stress through the FNIP1 protein, which contains three conserved Cys residues that are selectively reduced upon ROS depletion (Manford et al., 2020Manford A.G. Rodríguez-Pérez F. Shih K.Y. Shi Z. Berdan C.A. Choe M. Titov D.V. Nomura D.K. Rape M.

The E3 ligase CUL2FEM1B ubiquitylates reduced FNIP1 to trigger its proteasomal degradation, which allows cells to re-activate oxidative phosphorylation and replenish their ROS supply. Key to the reductive stress response is the ability of CUL2FEM1B to distinguish reduced from oxidized FNIP1 (Manford et al., 2020Manford A.G. Rodríguez-Pérez F. Shih K.Y. Shi Z. Berdan C.A. Choe M.

Loss of FNIP1 inhibits B cell differentiation and causes agammaglobulinemia and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Baba et al., 2012Baba M. Keller J.R. Sun H.W. Resch W. Kuchen S. Suh H.C. Hasumi H.

Duffourd Y. Vitobello A. Bruel A.L. Urteaga B. Coubes C. Garret P. Nambot S. Chevarin M.

Med. 2019; 21: 2504-2511Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Because deletion of a single FEM1B allele in mice did not reveal phenotypes (Lu et al., 2005Lu D. Ventura-Holman T. Li J. McMurray R.W. Subauste J.S. Maher J.F. Abnormal glucose homeostasis and pancreatic islet function in mice with inactivation of the Fem1b gene.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2005; 25: 6570-6577Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), mutation of R126 likely exerts a gain of function that disrupts development. This suggested that reductive stress signaling must be strictly controlled, yet regulators of this pathway have not been identified.Here, we report the structural basis and regulation of the reductive stress response. Using X-ray crystallography, we found that CUL2FEM1B relies on zinc to selectively bind reduced, but not oxidized, FNIP1. Zinc functions in analogy to molecular glues that elicit protein degradation in a therapeutic setting (Jevtić et al., 2021Jevtić P. Haakonsen D.L. Rapé M.

Although the critical residue in disease, R126, is located within the substrate binding pocket of FEM1B, it does not engage FNIP1 but recruits BEX proteins as pseudosubstrate inhibitors of CUL2FEM1B. Loss of BEX genes in patients with Xq22 deletion and mutation of R126 in FEM1B cause similar developmental syndromes (Hijazi et al., 2020Hijazi H. Coelho F.S. Gonzaga-Jauregui C. Bernardini L.

To reveal the molecular basis of this signaling circuit, we identified a FEM1B construct with six annotated ankyrin repeats and one TPR repeat that was sufficient to capture the FNIP1 degron (Figure S1A). We purified the complex between this FEM1B construct and a 30-residue FNIP1 degron to homogeneity (Figure S1B) and determined its X-ray crystal structure to a resolution of 2.9 Å (Figures 1A and S1C–S1G; Table S1).Figure 1Interface zinc ions are essential for substrate recognition by CUL2FEM1BShow full caption(A) Crystal structure of FEM1B (residues 1–377; blue) and the FNIP1 degron (residues 562–591) reveals two zinc ions (pink) at the E3-substrate interface.(B) FEM1B contains a N = terminal repeat (NR), six ankyrin repeats, and a TPR domain that is connected through another helical region.(C) Zinc chelation by TPEN abrogated FNIP1 recognition by FEM1B, as monitored by fluorescence polarization (FP) (n = 3; SD).(D) Effects of altered zinc levels onto FNIP1 binding to FEM1B, as shown by FP (n = 3; SD).(E) 293T cells were treated with 3.5 μM TPEN, FLAGFEM1B was immunoprecipitated, and co-purifying FNIP1 or CUL2 were detected by western blotting.(F) Degradation of a FNIP reporter (GFPdegron) in relation to mCherry.

Of the four FEM1B molecules in the asymmetric unit, two showed clear density for a bound degron (Figures S1D, S1E, and S2A). The structures of all FEM1B molecules in the asymmetric unit were highly similar to each other (Figure S2A), and FEM1B adopted the same conformation without substrate or when in complex with a distinct target, a C-end rule degron (Chen et al., 2021Chen X.

To gain access to its binding pocket on FEM1B, FNIP1 forms an extended loop that is characterized by a sharp turn imposed by a Pro residue (Figures 1A and 1B). This loop orients the three conserved Cys residues of the FNIP1 degron toward FEM1B. Although the FNIP1 loop docks onto a similar region of FEM1B as the C-end rule degron, it does not engage several FEM1B residues critical for C-end rule recognition (Figure S2D).Despite its similarities with other ankyrin-repeat proteins, CUL2FEM1B uses a distinct mechanism to recognize its substrate. Most proteins rely on interactions between amino acid side chains or the peptide backbone to engage their targets. In stark contrast, the complex between FEM1B and FNIP1 is predominantly mediated by two Zn2+ ions coordinated at the interface between FEM1B and the tip of the FNIP1 degron loop (Figures 1A, S1F, and S1G). We detected Zn2+ in FEM1B-FNIP1 complexes by X-ray diffraction (Figure S3A), X-ray fluorescence (Figure S3B), and inductively coupled plasma spectroscopy (Figure S3C). When we removed zinc by N,N,N′,N′-tetrakis(2-pyridinylmethyl)-1,2-ethanediamine (TPEN), binding of FNIP1 to recombinant FEM1B was lost in a dose-dependent manner (Figures 1C and 1D), whereas increasing Zn2+ levels allowed FEM1B to bind more FNIP1 (Figure 1D). Only Zn2+, but not several other metal ions, was able to stabilize the FEM1B-FNIP1 interaction (Figure S3D).Figure S3Zinc mediates FNIP1 recognition by FEM1B, related to Figure 1Show full captionA.

The association between a fluorescently labeled FNIP1 degron and FEM1B was monitored by fluorescence polarization. (n = 3; SD). E. A GFP-based reporter monitoring the abundance of the thalidomide-sensitive E4F1 degron showed that zinc chelation at levels disrupting FNIP1 degradation does not affect the stability of this CUL4CRBN substrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Consistent with these biochemical data, reducing cellular zinc levels with TPEN prevented substrate binding by FEM1B without disrupting the integrity of CUL2FEM1B (Figure 1E). A flow cytometry assay, which measures the abundance of GFP fused to the FNIP1 degron (GFPdegron) (Manford et al., 2020Manford A.G. Rodríguez-Pérez F. Shih K.Y. Shi Z. Berdan C.A. Choe M. Titov D.V.

A Cellular Mechanism to Detect and Alleviate Reductive Stress.Cell. 2020; 183: 46-61.e21Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), accordingly revealed that TPEN protected FNIP1 from FEM1B-induced degradation (Figure 1F). The same treatment did not affect a reporter that is turned over through CUL4CRBN (Figure S3E), although this E3 ligase shares the RING subunit RBX1 with CUL2FEM1B (Fischer et al., 2014Fischer E.S. Böhm K. Lydeard J.R. Yang H. Stadler M.B. Cavadini S. Nagel J. Serluca F. Acker V. Lingaraju G.M. et al.Structure of the DDB1-CRBN E3 ubiquitin ligase in complex with thalidomide.Nature. 2014; 512: 49-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). At our concentrations, TPEN therefore strongly inhibited substrate binding by CUL2FEM1B, yet it did not extract zinc from the RING domain. We conclude that interface zinc ions play an essential role in mediating FNIP1 recognition by CUL2FEM1B.A Cys/His claw coordinates zinc at the protein interfaceMost proteins bind zinc through Cys or His residues (Kocyła et al., 2021Kocyła A. Tran J.B. Krężel A. Galvanization of Protein-Protein Interactions in a Dynamic Zinc Interactome.Trends Biochem.

https://openalex.org/W3199439694,"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is a zoonotic pathogen with pandemic potential. RVFV entry is mediated by the viral glycoprotein (Gn), but host entry factors remain poorly defined. Our genome-wide CRISPR screen identified low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (mouse Lrp1/human LRP1), heat shock protein (Grp94), and receptor-associated protein (RAP) as critical host factors for RVFV infection. RVFV Gn directly binds to specific Lrp1 clusters and is glycosylation independent. Exogenous addition of murine RAP domain 3 (mRAPD3) and anti-Lrp1 antibodies neutralizes RVFV infection in taxonomically diverse cell lines. Mice treated with mRAPD3 and infected with pathogenic RVFV are protected from disease and death. A mutant mRAPD3 that binds Lrp1 weakly failed to protect from RVFV infection. Together, these data support Lrp1 as a host entry factor for RVFV infection and define a new target to limit RVFV infections."

However, the molecular basis of the mechanism by which this mutation enhances fitness is not clear. Here we demonstrated by cryo-electron microscopy that the D614G mutation resulted in increased propensity of multiple receptor-binding domains (RBDs) in an upward conformation poised for host receptor binding. Multiple substates within the one RBD-up or two RBD-up conformational space were determined. According to negative staining electron microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and differential scanning fluorimetry, the most significant impact of the mutation lies in its ability to eliminate the unusual cold-induced unfolding characteristics and to significantly increase the thermal stability under physiological pH. The D614G spike variant also exhibited exceptional long-term stability when stored at 37 °C for up to 2 months. Our findings shed light on how the D614G mutation enhances the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 through a stabilizing mutation and suggest an approach for better design of spike protein-based conjugates for vaccine development.

The COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019) pandemic is caused by the infection of SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) (1Zhu N. Zhang D. Wang W. Li X. Yang B. Song J. Zhao X. Huang B. Shi W. Lu R. Niu P. Zhan F. Ma X. Wang D. Xu W. et al.A novel coronavirus from patients with pneumonia in China, 2019.N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; 382: 727-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (17405) Google Scholar). Early bioinformatic analysis of the reported genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 revealed the emergence of a prominent pairwise linkage disequilibrium between three nucleotide changes since mid-February 2020, namely nt3037 (C > T), nt14408 (C > T), and nt23403 (A > G). The last mutation corresponds to a missense D614G mutation in the spike (S) protein (2Yang H.-C. Chen C.-H. Wang J.-H. Liao H.-C. Yang C.-T. Chen C.-W. Lin Y.-C. Kao C.-H. Lu M.-Y.J. Liao J.C.

The G clade, which harbors the aforementioned three nucleotide changes and the nt241 (C > T) mutation, relative to the original Wuhan form (hereafter wild type, WT), became the dominant form of the COVID-19 pandemic since the summer of 2020 (https://www.gisaid.org/). The enhanced infectivity of the D614G variant is observed in cell cultures as well as animal models (3Plante J.A. Liu Y. Liu J. Xia H. Johnson B.A. Lokugamage K.G. Zhang X. Muruato A.E. Zou J.

The SARS-CoV-2 S protein (hereafter S protein) is responsible for host recognition and viral entry. The S protein binds to the receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), through an upward open RBD conformation (RBD-up); a downward closed RBD conformation (RBD-down) sequesters its receptor-binding motif (RBM) from receptor binding, rendering such a conformation inactive (4Wrapp D.

Despite the large size, the S protein is marginally stable over a narrow range of temperatures. Incubation of the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein at 4 °C leads to significant unfolding within 24 h. The morphological change of cold denaturation resembles that after a brief heat shock at 50 to 60 °C (11Xiong X. Qu K. Ciazynska K.A. Hosmillo M. Carter A.P. Ebrahimi S. Ke Z. Scheres S.H.W.

As a vaccine candidate for mitigating COVID-19, the sensitivity of the recombinant SARS-CoV-2 S protein to cold- and heat-induced unfolding is a major concern. Here, we demonstrated the structural dynamics of the D614G variant spike protein (hereafter S-D614G) by using cryo-EM with the aid of three-dimensional variability analysis (3DVA) (13Punjani A. Fleet D.J. 3D variability analysis: Resolving continuous flexibility and discrete heterogeneity from single particle cryo-EM.J. Struct. Biol. 2021; 213: 107702Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Compared with the wild-type S (hereafter S-D614), the increased propensity of S-D614G in the RBD-up conformation implicated the facilitation of the binding to the receptor ACE2. We further conducted the negative staining electronic microscopy (NSEM) analysis coupled with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) to reveal that the D614G mutation eliminates the cold sensitivity of the original D614 and confers the resistance to the high temperature. Our study shows that the S protein with the D614G mutation is more thermally stable than S-D614, suggesting that S-D614G will be a new candidate for vaccine development. Using cryo-EM single particle reconstruction aided by 3DVA analysis (13Punjani A.

Collectively, 62% of the total population of S-D614G had one RBD in an up conformation (one RBD-up), including three distinct substates that separated the RBD conformations, and 38% of the population had two RBDs in an up conformation (two RBD-up) with two different substates. The three distinct RBD-up substrates in the one RBD-up class showed a 39 to 52° upward rotation with respect to the hinge defined as the Cα atom of the beginning of RBD, i.e., residue 330 (Fig. 1D). Similarly, the two distinct RBD-up substates in the two RBD-up class showed a 42 to 47° upward rotation. Contrary to S-D614, we did not observe any all RBD-down conformation in S-D614G, in line with the previous study of a similar construct without the transmembrane domain (15Benton D.J. Wrobel A.G.

A common feature of reported S-D614G structures, however, is the increased propensity to populate the RBD-up conformations, and the two RBD-up conformations have not been reported for S-D614 (Table S2). Since the upward conformation of the RBD is the prerequisite of host receptor ACE2 binding, the increased population of the RBD-up conformations with more conformational plasticity may explain why S-D614G is found to exhibit enhanced binding to the receptor ACE2 (21Ozono S.

A. 2021; 118e2112850118Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) proposed that the loss of a key salt bridge formed by D614 of one protomer and K584 or the other protomer due to the D614G mutation leads to local disorder, thereby increasing the dynamics of S-D614G and more populated RBD-up conformations, a finding that could be confirmed by our cryo-EM structures (Fig. S5). Nevertheless, the molecular basis of how the D614G mutation could allosterically change the conformation and dynamics of the RBDs remains to be established. Having established that the structure of S-D614G is not significantly perturbed by the D614G mutation under native conditions, we sought to investigate the impact of the D614G mutation on the thermal stability over a range of experimental conditions. Knowing that the S protein is susceptible to cold denaturation, all experiments were carried out using freshly prepared S-D614 and S-D614G, which were secreted into the culture media at 37 °C, and purified at room temperature (Fig. S6). We carried out negative stain electron microscopy (NSEM) analyses on S-D614 and S-D614G on day 0 and on day 6 after continuous incubation at 37 °C and 4 °C. In line with the previous finding (12Edwards R.J. Mansouri K. Stalls V. Manne K. Watts B. Parks R. Janowska K. Gobeil S.M.C. Kopp M. Li D. Lu X. Deyton M. Oguin T.H. O.r. Sprenz J. Williams W. et al.Cold sensitivity of the SARS-CoV-2 spike ectodomain.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2020; 28: 128-131Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar), S-D614 remained stable at 37 °C for 6 days without discernible morphological change, while significant unfolding was observed after incubation at 4 °C for 6 days (Fig. 2). Quantitative analysis showed that the 6-day incubation at 37 °C and 4 °C resulted in 12 ± 6% and 96 ± 1% loss of native particles, respectively (Figs. 2 and 3A, Table S3). Unexpectedly, S-D614G did not show significant unfolding after the same cold treatment: the 6-day incubation at 37 °C and 4 °C resulted in 1 ± 3% and 12 ± 3% loss of native particles, respectively (Figs. 2 and 3A). Remarkably, after 2 months of incubation at 37 °C, S-D614G remained mostly intact according to NSEM analysis (Fig. S7). When subjected to heat-induced denaturation of both proteins at 50 °C and 60 °C, S-D614 exhibited significant unfolding at 30 min of heat shock at 50 °C and 60 °C, resulting in 34 ± 15% and 91 ± 4% loss of native particles, respectively. In contrast, the same heat shock treatment resulted in 17 ± 5% (50 °C) and 58 ± 6% (60 °C) loss of native particles for S-D614G. Furthermore, S-D614 exhibited more variations in the number of native particles per micrograph, particular in the case of heat treatment at 50 °C for 30 min (Fig. 3A). Note, however, that despite the significant reduction in the number of native-like particles after cold and/or heat treatments, the resulting 3D EM maps of S-D614 and S-D614G were very similar at the resolution of approximately 10 Å (insets in Fig. 2), suggesting that the unfolding processes of the S protein variants follow an apparent two-state model resulting in different levels of native populations after the treatments. Indeed, further analysis with more incubation temperatures for S-D614G yielded a two-state-like melting curve with an apparent Tm of 59 °C (Fig. 4).Figure 4Relative native-like particle number of S-D614G as a function of temperature. All samples were incubated at the specified temperatures as indicated along the X-axis for 30 min prior to NESM grid preparation. The numbers of native-like particles in individual micrographs were normalized with respect to the average value of freshly prepared sample (37 °C, day 0). The error bars correspond to the standard deviations of the numbers within the micrographs collected under the same conditions. For each temperature, between 50 and 60 NSEM micrographs were collected. 3D maps of the individual samples derived from the native-like particle images are shown next to the data points.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We further analyzed the thermal unfolding of S-D614 and S-D614G at pH 7.6 by DSC. Both S-D614 and S-D614G exhibited two transition peaks and shared a similar melting temperature (Tm) for the first transition at ca. 52 °C. However, S-D614G exhibited a higher Tm for the second transition (Tm = 68.8 °C) compared with that of S-D614 (Tm = 66.9 °C). Moreover, the total enthalpy of unfolding ΔH of S-D614G was approximately 40% higher than that for S-D614 (Fig. 3B and Table 1). The bimodal distribution of the DSC profile of S-D614G has been reported previously (12Edwards R.J. Mansouri K. Stalls V. Manne K. Watts B. Parks R. Janowska K. Gobeil S.M.C. Kopp M. Li D. Lu X.

Indeed, the second transition peak was lost for S-D614 after incubation at 4 °C for 6 days, while that of S-D614G remained largely unaffected; in line with NSEM results, long-term incubation at 37 °C did not significantly affect both variants (Fig. 3B). While keeping purified proteins at 4 °C for long-term storage is generally considered to be more favorable than storage at 37 °C, this was not applicable to S-D614. In contrast, S-D614G was not sensitive to cold denaturation and is more robust during transient heat shock (Table 1). The stabilization effect of the D614G mutation was most pronounced under neutral to slightly alkaline conditions as demonstrated by label-free DSF analyses of S-D614 and S-D614G over a range of pH values (Fig. 3C). Both variants exhibited multiple inflection temperatures (Ti) between pH 4 and 8 as has been reported previously (12Edwards R.J. Mansouri K. Stalls V. Manne K. Watts B. Parks R. Janowska K.

The complex melting curves indicated the presence of multiple transition events sensed by the large number of tryptophans and tyrosines within S-D614 and S-D614G, but it is not trivial to assign a specific transition point to a given tryptophan or tyrosine residue. Nonetheless, pairwise comparison of the unfolding curves of S-D614 and S-D614G showed that their profiles were indistinguishable at pH 6 and below. For pH 7.0 and above, only the transition between 70 and 75 °C showed a clear difference between the two variants, suggesting that the stabilizing effect of D614G is likely contributing to the integrity of the S protein before being endocytosed into the host cell.Table 1Summary of DSC analysis of S-D614 and S-D614G after different treatmentsConditionSampleEnthalpy of unfolding (kcal mol−1)Tm1 (°C)Tm2 (°C)FreshS-D614158066.9S-D614G225068.837 °C, 6 daysS-D61499767.0S-D614G156068/94 °C, 6 daysS-D61485348.266.8S-D614G212049.068.9 Open table in a new tab In this work, we determined the cryo-EM structure of S-D614G and revealed the high degree of conformational heterogeneity mostly confined within the RBDs (Fig. 1C). Contrary to the previous report by Yurkovetskiy et al. (20Yurkovetskiy L. Wang X. Pascal K.E. Tomkins-Tinch C. Nyalile T.P. Wang Y. Baum A. Diehl W.E. Dauphin A. Carbone C. Veinotte K. Egri S.B.

(Fig. S4) (15Benton D.J. Wrobel A.G. Roustan C. Borg A. Xu P. Martin S.R. Rosenthal P.B. Skehel J.J. Gamblin S.J. The effect of the D614G substitution on the structure of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2021; 118e2112850118Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The most significant finding is the markedly increased resistance of S-D614G to withstand cold- and heat-induced unfolding (Fig. 2). Although the loss of the salt bridge between D614 and K584 is enthalpically unfavorable, it is compensated by other enthalpic gains evidenced by the significantly higher total enthalpy of unfolding ΔH of S-D614G compared with that of S-D614 (Fig. 2). We argue that the increased stability of S-D614G could be further attributed to the increased configurational entropy manifested in the higher conformational heterogeneity of the RBDs (Fig. 1C), which contributes to the free energy gain of the system. The significance of our findings is threefold. First, the increased folding stability may help explain the gain in fitness of the G clade SARS-CoV-2, which relies on the surface S protein to recognize host receptor molecules, namely ACE2. The elimination of the cold sensitivity of the S protein will undoubtedly increase the robustness of the infection machinery over a range of environment conditions. Second, our DSC analysis of freshly prepared S protein variants hinted at the possibility that some of the previously reported cryo-EM and biophysical studies of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein may have been affected by its sensitivity to cold treatments leading to the unfolding and the loss of structural elements that give rise to the thermal transition peaks at around 60 to 70 °C (Fig. 2). More importantly, the partial unfolding of the S protein is expected to significantly alter the accessibility of the RBD to which ACE2 and neutralizing antibodies bind and hence impact interpretations of binding assays. Third, the ability of S-D614G to withstand long-term storage at 4 °C without unfolding the prefusion state provides a solution to better vaccine designs and formulation without the need to introduce a large number of mutations and disulfide bonds (11Xiong X.

https://openalex.org/W3199116639,"A crucial question in the governance of infectious disease outbreaks is how to ensure that people continue to adhere to mitigation measures for the longer duration. The present paper examines this question by means of a set of cross-sectional studies conducted in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic, in May, June, and July of 2020. Using stratified samples that mimic the demographic characteristics of the U.S. population, it seeks to understand to what extent Americans continued to adhere to social distancing measures in the period after the first lockdown ended. Moreover, it seeks to uncover which variables sustained (or undermined) adherence across this period. For this purpose, we examined a broad range of factors, relating to people’s (1) knowledge and understanding of the mitigation measures, (2) perceptions of their costs and benefits, (3) perceptions of legitimacy and procedural justice, (4) personal factors, (5) social environment, and (6) practical circumstances. Our findings reveal that adherence was chiefly shaped by three major factors: respondents adhered more when they (a) had greater practical capacity to adhere, (b) morally agreed more with the measures, and (c) perceived the virus as a more severe health threat. Adherence was shaped to a lesser extent by impulsivity, knowledge of social distancing measures, opportunities for violating, personal costs, and descriptive social norms. The results also reveal, however, that adherence declined across this period, which was partly explained by changes in people’s moral alignment, threat perceptions, knowledge, and perceived social norms. These findings show that adherence originates from a broad range of factors that develop dynamically across time. Practically these insights help to improve pandemic governance, as well as contributing theoretically to the study of compliance and the way that rules come to shape behavior."
https://openalex.org/W3200803606,"The SARS-CoV-2 replication-transcription complex is an assembly of nonstructural viral proteins that collectively act to reproduce the viral genome and generate mRNA transcripts. While the structures of the individual proteins involved are known, how they assemble into a functioning superstructure is not. Applying molecular modeling tools, including protein-protein docking, to the available structures of nsp7-nsp16 and the nucleocapsid, we have constructed an atomistic model of how these proteins associate. Our principal finding is that the complex is hexameric, centered on nsp15. The nsp15 hexamer is capped on two faces by trimers of nsp14/nsp16/(nsp10)2, which then recruit six nsp12/nsp7/(nsp8)2 polymerase subunits to the complex. To this, six subunits of nsp13 are arranged around the superstructure, but not evenly distributed. Polymerase subunits that coordinate dimers of nsp13 are capable of binding the nucleocapsid, which positions the 5'-UTR TRS-L RNA over the polymerase active site, a state distinguishing transcription from replication. Analysis of the viral RNA path through the complex indicates the dsRNA that exits the polymerase passes over the nsp14 exonuclease and nsp15 endonuclease sites before being unwound by a convergence of zinc fingers from nsp10 and nsp14. The template strand is then directed away from the complex, while the nascent strand is directed to the sites responsible for mRNA capping. The model presents a cohesive picture of the multiple functions of the coronavirus replication-transcription complex and addresses fundamental questions related to proofreading, template switching, mRNA capping, and the role of the endonuclease."
https://openalex.org/W3200317836,"Intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles composed of Tau aggregates have been widely accepted as an important pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. A current therapeutic avenue for treating Alzheimer's disease is aimed at inhibiting Tau accumulation with small molecules such as natural flavonoids. Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of Tau can lead to its aggregation, and Tau aggregates can then be degraded by autophagy. However, it is unclear whether natural flavonoids modulate the formation of phase-separated Tau droplets or promote autophagy and Tau clearance. Here, using confocal microscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching assays, we report that a natural antioxidant flavonoid compound myricetin slows LLPS of full-length human Tau, shifting the equilibrium phase boundary to a higher protein concentration. This natural flavonoid also significantly inhibits pathological phosphorylation and abnormal aggregation of Tau in neuronal cells and blocks mitochondrial damage and apoptosis induced by Tau aggregation. Importantly, using coimmunoprecipitation and Western blotting, we show that treatment of cells with myricetin stabilizes the interaction between Tau and autophagy-related protein 5 (ATG5) to promote clearance of phosphorylated Tau to indirectly limit its aggregation. Consistently, this natural flavonoid inhibits mTOR pathway, activates ATG5-dependent Tau autophagy, and almost completely suppresses Tau toxicity in neuronal cells. Collectively, these results demonstrate how LLPS and abnormal aggregation of Tau are inhibited by natural flavonoids, bridging the gap between Tau LLPS and aggregation in neuronal cells, and also establish that myricetin could act as an ATG5-dependent autophagic activator to ameliorate the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W3199221246,"Background If a COVID-19 patient develops a so-called severe course, he or she must be taken to hospital as soon as possible. This proves difficult in domestic isolation, as patients are not continuously monitored. The aim of our study was to establish a telemonitoring system in this setting. Methods Oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, heart rate and temperature were measured every 15 minutes using an in-ear device. The data was transmitted to the Telecovid Centre via mobile network or internet and monitored 24/7 by a trained team. The data were supplemented by daily telephone calls. The patients´ individual risk was assessed using a modified National Early Warning Score. In case of a deterioration, a physician initiated the appropriate measures. Covid-19 Patients were included if they were older than 60 years or fulfilled at least one of the following conditions: pre-existing disease (cardiovascular, pulmonary, immunologic), obesity (BMI &gt;35), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, active malignancy, or pregnancy. Findings 153 patients (median age 59 years, 77 female) were included. Patients were monitored for 9 days (median, IQR 6–13 days) with a daily monitoring time of 13.3 hours (median, IQR 9.4–17.0 hours). 20 patients were referred to the clinic by the Telecovid team. 3 of these required intensive care without invasive ventilation, 4 with invasive ventilation, 1 of the latter died. All patients agreed that the device was easy to use. About 90% of hospitalised patients indicated that they would have delayed hospitalisation further if they had not been part of the study. Interpretation Our study demonstrates the successful implementation of a remote monitoring system in a pandemic situation. All clinically necessary information was obtained and adequate measures were derived from it without delay."
https://openalex.org/W3201299239,"Background According to the World Health Organization, viral diseases continue to emerge and represent a serious issue for public health. The elderly and those with underlying chronic diseases are more likely to become severe cases. Our study sets out to present in-depth exploration and analyses of the community’s risk perception and barriers to the practice of COVID-19 prevention measures in South Gondar Zone, Northwest Ethiopia. Methods A qualitative study was done in three districts of South Gondar Zone. Community key informants and health extension workers were selected purposely for in-depth interviews and focus group discussion. The interviews were conducted by maintaining WHO recommendations for social distancing and use of appropriate personal protective equipment. The sample size for the study depended on the theoretical saturation of the data at the time of data collection. The qualitative data generated from in-depth interviews and focus group discussions was transcribed verbatim and translated into English language and thematically analyzed using open code software version 4.02. Results Three main themes and five categories emerged from the narrations of the participants regarding the perceived barriers for the practice of COVID-19 prevention measures. A total of 9 community key informants (5 women development armies (HDA), 2 health extension workers (HEW), and 2 religious leaders participated in the in-depth interview, while two focus group discussions (7 participants in each round) were conducted among purposely selected community members. The age of the participants ranged from 24 to 70 years with the median age of 48 years. The major identified barriers for practicing COVID-19 prevention measures were the presence of strong cultural and religious practices, perceiving that the disease does not affect the young, misinformation about the disease, and lack of trust in the prevention measures. Conclusions Socio-cultural, religious, and economic related barriers were identified from the participant’s narratives for the practice of COVID-19 prevention measures in south Gondar Zone. Our findings suggest the need to strengthen community awareness and education programs about the prevention measures of COVID-19 and increase diagnostic facilities with strong community-based surveillance to control the transmission of the pandemic."

Here, we used single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) analysis to uncover the importance of the mitochondrial respiratory chain for ECM homeostasis in mature cartilage.

The mitochondrial respiratory chain (mtRC) is the major source of cellular energy, but the connection between respiratory activity and ECM homeostasis is still poorly understood (1Romani P.

Bulk RNA transcriptome profiling showed that lack of respiration was translated into a general integrated stress response, but the individual load of mtRC dysfunction in chondrocyte subpopulations and the impact on ECM homeostasis remained unclear. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) has evolved as a method to provide a high-resolution map of cellular transcriptomes with the promise of improving the understanding of individual cell function and dysfunction (7Eberwine J.

Res. 2010; 25: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). This technology could therefore be suited to correlate activated ECM-related genetic programs in chondrocyte subpopulations with impaired mtRC activity, but to our knowledge, scRNA-Seq was not yet applied to high-resolution transcriptome analysis of mutant mice with a cartilage phenotype. The aim of this study was to define the individual cellular load of mtRC dysfunction and define the impact on ECM homeostasis and cartilage stability using a combined approach of high-resolution scRNA-Seq, mass spectrometry/matrisome analysis, and atomic force microscopy (AFM) in mutant mice with cartilage-specific inactivation of mtRC function. The mouse proximal femoral epiphysis (PFE) is a unique source of cartilage to isolate sufficient cell numbers for scRNA-Seq analysis. We wanted to analyze older mutant mice with increased mtRC deficiency and therefore first determined mtRC activity and cartilage organization in the PFE of 1-month-old Cre and CreTW mice. Cytochrome c oxidase (CYTOCOX; complex IV)/succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) activity staining demonstrated CYTOCOX activity in articular and growth plate cartilage of 1-month-old Cre mice, with the strongest staining present at the chondro-osseus junction close to the bone marrow. In CreTW mice, loss of CYTOCOX activity was predominately observed in the calcified zone and growth plate, as indicated by blue SDH staining (Fig. 1B). These changes in CreTW mice were associated with the expansion of the central area of the PFE cartilage and disturbed chondrocyte organization as shown by safranin O staining (Fig. 1C). The results indicate that distinct chondrocyte subpopulations show a higher degree of mtRC deficiency, leading to subpopulation-specific histomorphological changes in PFE cartilage of CreTW mice. scRNA-Seq analysis was then applied to correlate transcriptional changes in individual chondrocyte subpopulations of CreTW mice with the load of mtRC deficiency. Chondrocytes from PFE cartilage of 1-month-old Cre and CreTW mice were isolated by collagenase digestion, and after barcode labeling, complementary DNA (cDNA) generation, and massive parallel sequencing, the data were processed, and marker gene expression was used to annotate and analyze cluster-specific differential gene expression (Fig. 2A). Similar numbers of cells were analyzed, and a median of 3751 or 3396 genes per cell was identified in Cre and CreTW mice, respectively (Fig. 2B). High unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts (>5000 counts) were observed for the majority of cells, and several cell clusters were identified by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding visualization of the high dimensional transcriptome data (Fig. 2, C and D). Differential gene expression analysis was used to identify cell type–specific marker genes and to annotate individual cell clusters (Fig. 3A). Clusters of immune cells (F4/80+ macrophages, S100A9+ neutrophils, and CD79a+ B-cell clusters) and of Derl3+ cells linked to the endoplasmic reticulum–associated degradation pathway were detected, but the majority of cells were Col2a1+ chondrocytes. Within this Col2a1+ main population, we identified subclusters of Prg4+/Cilp+ articular, and Col10a1+ prehypertrophic/hypertrophic (PH/H) chondrocytes as well as a unique population of Prg4−/Cilp−/Col10a1− chondrocytes (Fig. 3B). Interestingly, the number of cells in this unique cartilage subpopulation was increased in CreTW mice, whereas the number of cells in the articular and PH/H subpopulation was decreased (Fig. 3C). Therefore, mtRC deficiency may alter the cellular composition of PFE cartilage in CreTW mice.Figure 3Marker gene–based identification of cell clusters.

Bioinformatics analysis uncovered 26 genes regulated between Cre and CreTW subclusters and, among those, mainly mtDNA-encoded genes were downregulated in CreTW chondrocytes (Fig. 4A). T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding plots of the highest ranked differentially expressed mtDNA-encoded genes were used to visualize expression differences between chondrocyte subpopulations in Cre and CreTW mice. mt-NADH–ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 4L (mt-Nd4l), mt-NADH–ubiquinone oxidoreductase chain 3 (mt-Nd3), and mt-cytochrome b (mt-Cytb) were expressed in all chondrocyte subpopulations isolated from Cre mice. Expression of these mtDNA-encoded genes was slightly reduced in articular chondrocytes of CreTW mice, and the downregulation was more pronounced in the PH/H and unique subpopulations (Fig. 4, B and C). About 14 nuclear-encoded genes were differentially expressed in nonarticular chondrocytes but not in articular chondrocytes. Five genes linked to the ECM were identified (Fig. 4, A and C), and among those, Mmp10, Thbs1, and Matn1 were increasingly expressed in CreTW mice. The results show that mtRC dysfunction strongly affects the expression of mtDNA-encoded and nuclear ECM-related genes in nonarticular chondrocyte subpopulations. To understand the consequences of this altered gene expression profile for ECM production and deposition in PFE cartilage, we studied protein abundance and distribution of matrilin-1 (MATN1) and thrombospondin 1 (THBS1) using validated antibodies. Protein levels of MATN1 and THBS1 were strongly about approximately fourfold increased in total extracts of CreTW cartilage compared with control (n = 3 per genotype), as demonstrated by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5A, quantification). In situ detection using immunofluorescence microscopy showed that MATN1 was present in the proximal epiphysis and growth plate cartilage of Cre and CreTW mice (Fig. 5B) and in the expanded central area of the PFE cartilage in CreTW mice. A thin layer of extracellular THBS1 was detected at the resting zone of the growth plate cartilage in Cre mice, and this THBS1+ area was massively expanded into the central area of CreTW mice (Fig. 5C). MATN1 and THBS1 levels modulate collagen fibril assembly and ECM organization (13Nicolae C. Ko Y.P. Miosge N. Niehoff A. Studer D. Enggist L. Hunziker E.B. Paulsson M. Wagener R. Aszodi A.

Signal. 2018; 11eaar2566Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and a strongly increased incorporation of MATN1 and THBS1 into the ECM of CreTW mice may therefore affect the cartilage ECM organization. To determine the consequences for ECM composition, we studied the proteome of PFE cartilage from 1-month-old Cre and CreTW mice (n = 4 per genotype) using established protocols (15Georgieva V.S. Etich J. Bluhm B. Zhu M. Frie C. Wilson R. Zaucke F. Bateman J. Brachvogel B. Ablation of the miRNA cluster 24 has profound effects on extracellular matrix protein abundance in cartilage.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020; 21: 4112Crossref Scopus (2) Google Scholar). In total, 808 entities were differentially abundant between PFE cartilage from Cre and CreTW mice (Fig. 6, A and C). STRING-implemented reactome enrichment analysis showed that “metabolism” and the metabolism-related terms “citric acid cycle,” “respiratory electron transport,” and “complex I” were highly enriched. “ECM organization” was the only nonmetabolism-related term within the highest ranked pathways (Fig. 6B), suggesting that ECM alterations are a main target of mtRC deficiency in cartilage. Therefore, we next characterized the changes in ECM composition in detail by applying matrisome analysis to the proteome dataset (16Bergmeier V. Etich J. Pitzler L. Frie C. Koch M. Fischer M. Rappl G. Abken H. Tomasek J.J. Brachvogel B.

Brachvogel B. Gene expression profiling of the extracellular matrix signature in macrophages of different activation status: Relevance for skin wound healing.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2019; 20: 5086Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Among the regulated ECM-related entities, 44 were associated to the core matrisome and 39 to the matrisome-associated cluster (Fig. 6C). Collagens and proteoglycans within the core matrisome were predominately decreased in PFE cartilage of CreTW mice but not noncollagenous glycoproteins (Fig. 6D). Interestingly, the fibrillar collagen II and extrafibrillar proteoglycan aggrecan were detected but not regulated in proteome analysis, while we observed decreased levels of collagen II and increased levels of aggrecan by immunoblot analysis (Fig. S2B). In line with the previous results, the abundance of the perifibrillar protein MATN1 and the matricellular protein THBS1 was increased. In addition, 44 differentially abundant matrisome-associated proteins were identified, and STRING-based analysis showed that these proteins are primarily involved in proteolytic ECM processing, collagen formation, and crosslinking of collagen fibrils (Fig. 6E). Among those proteins, prolyl 4-hydroxylase and three lysyl oxidases formed a distinct protein cluster involved in collagen triple helix/fibril stability and crosslinking. Hence, we analyzed those collagen crosslinks that predominate in mature cartilage (18Eyre D.R. Weis M.A. Wu J.J. Advances in collagen cross-link analysis.Methods. 2008; 45: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and determined the content of the hydroxylysine aldehyde–derived difunctional dihydroxylysinonorleucine (DHLNL) and its trifunctional maturation product hydroxylysylpyridinoline (HP). Here, we detected a significant increase in the mature trifunctional crosslink HP in PFE cartilage of CreTW mice compared with control (n = 6 per genotype) but not of the precursor difunctional crosslink DHLNL (Fig. 7A). The increase in HP was associated with a slight decrease in total collagen content and an increase in noncollagenous proteins (Fig. 7B). The results show that crosslinking in collagen fibrils is increased in mtRC deficient cartilage, which may affect the stiffness and mechanostability of the ECM in cartilage. Changes in compressive stiffness of the ECM (Young's modulus) were then studied by nanoscale indentation-type AFM at various regions of the PFE (n = 3 per genotype). Bimodal distributions of the Young’s modulus were observed in the deeper articular zone, expanded zone, and proliferative zone of the growth plate. The two peaks in the distributions represent the softer proteoglycans (E1) and the stiffer collagens (E2) (Fig. 7C). The ECM of 1-month-old PFE cartilage from CreTW mice showed a general 20 to 50% increase in stiffness of the collagen moiety (E2) in all three regions investigated, whereas the proteoglycan moiety (E1) was stiffer only in the nonarticular resting and proliferative zone of growth plate cartilage. Unimodal distribution was detected in the much stiffer calcified cartilage zone, and the Young's modulus distributions exhibited only one distinct peak for Cre and CreTW, respectively (histograms not shown). Here, the median Young's modulus in CreTW mice was decreased by more than 80% in CreTW mice compared with control (Fig. 7D). ECM stiffness and mineralization processes are closely linked (19Grunherz L. Prein C. Winkler T. Kirsch M. Hopfner U. Streichert T. Clausen-Schaumann H. Zustin J. Kirchhof K. Morlock M.M.

Gleeson J.P. Matsiko A. Thompson E.M. O'Brien F.J. Effect of different hydroxyapatite incorporation methods on the structural and biological properties of porous collagen scaffolds for bone repair.J. Anat. 2015; 227: 732-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and we hypothesized that the decreased ECM stiffness in CreTW mice may indicate a reduced incorporation of hydroxyapatite crystals into collagen fibrils and less biomineralization. We therefore used electron microscopy to study the mineralization in the calcified zone of PFE cartilage. Electron dense mineralized structures were found in the ECM of chondrocytes in both Cre and CreTW mice (Fig. 7E). However, in Cre mice, the chondrocytes were surrounded by black needle-like crystal structures, and these mineralized areas were markedly reduced in CreTW mice. In summary, mtRC dysfunction in PFE cartilage induces a subpopulation-specific ECM-damage response in growth plate cartilage that alters the balance between collagenous and noncollagenous proteins, increases ECM crosslinking and stiffness, and reduces mineralization in the calcified zone. The mtRC is a surprisingly major prerequisite for postnatal cartilage growth and differentiation, but the requirement of mtRC for ECM homeostasis in mature cartilage has not yet been defined. Here, we show by scRNA-Seq analysis that impaired mtRC leads to a cell subpopulation–specific ECM-damage response and an altered mechanostability in PFE cartilage. The visualization of the transcriptome landscape at the single-cell level in a heterogeneous musculoskeletal cell population is technically challenging but was previously achieved for the developing knee joint and growth plate cartilage (8Kelly N.H.

Here, we successfully applied scRNA-Seq analysis to mature cartilage from 1-month-old TW helicase K320E transgenic mice. Similar cell numbers were sequenced, and similar cell types were identified in the PFE cartilage of Cre or CreTW mice, indicating that the isolation procedure has no influence on the sample composition. Because of the close association of bone marrow and cartilage at the chondro-osseus junction, a minor proportion of immune cells attached to the dissected PFE cartilage was found. Interestingly, F4/80+ macrophages were present within the immune cell population that expresses cartilage-specific ECM transcripts, for example, Prg4, Cilp, and Col2a1. This population may correspond to the nondestructive synthetic macrophages previously described to produce almost all known collagen mRNAs and to be involved in tissue remodeling and repair (21Schnoor M. Cullen P. Lorkowski J. Stolle K. Robenek H. Troyer D. Rauterberg J. Lorkowski S. Production of type VI collagen by human macrophages: A new dimension in macrophage functional heterogeneity.J. Immunol. 2008; 180: 5707-5719Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Within the Col2a1+ main chondrocyte population, articular and PH/H subpopulations could be identified by marker gene expression analysis. Prg4 (22Jay G.D. Waller K.A. The biology of lubricin: Near frictionless joint motion.Matrix Biol. 2014; 39: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) and Cilp (23Bernardo B.C. Belluoccio D. Rowley L. Little C.B. Hansen U. Bateman J.F. Cartilage intermediate layer protein 2 (CILP-2) is expressed in articular and meniscal cartilage and down-regulated in experimental osteoarthritis.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 37758-37767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) are common markers of articular cartilage, and both transcripts were expressed in PFE cartilage, but Cilp expression is restricted to a subpopulation of Prg4+ cells. This reflects the in situ expression of Cilp and Prg4 in cartilage, where Cilp is detected in the intermediate zone of articular cartilage (24Lorenzo P. Bayliss M.T. Heinegard D.

Chem. 1998; 273: 23463-23468Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), whereas Prg4 is expressed in the intermediate and superficial zone of articular cartilage (22Jay G.D.

Bone Miner. Res. 2010; 25: 1267-1281Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and was used to define the PH/H subpopulation within the scRNA-Seq dataset. Finally, a unique population of nonarticular Thbs1+chondrocytes was detected and linked to the expanded and disorganized central region of PFE in CreTW mice in situ. THBS1 was previously detected in a particular subpopulation of chondrocytes at a thin zone directly adjacent to mature PFE growth plate (26Heilig J. Dietmar H.F. Brachvogel B. Paulsson M. Zaucke F. Niehoff A.

The results suggest that the resting zone is expanded in response to mtRC dysfunction with multiple clusters of cells and no evident columnar organization in PFE cartilage. These findings differ from our previous results where mainly the hypertrophic area in the distal femoral epiphysis was expanded (6Holzer T. Probst K. Etich J. Auler M. Georgieva V.S. Bluhm B. Frie C. Heilig J. Niehoff A. Nuchel J. Plomann M. Seeger J.M. Kashkar H. Baris O.R. Wiesner R.J. et al.Respiratory chain inactivation links cartilage-mediated growth retardation to mitochondrial diseases.J. Cell Biol. 2019; 218: 1853-1870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). However, the proximal and distal epiphyses show significant differences in development. In mice, unlike most mammalian species (including human), the proximal epiphysis in the hip joint develops with no secondary ossification center forming in the epiphysis, but with direct mineralization of the cartilage (27Cole H.A. Yuasa M. Hawley G. Cates J.M. Nyman J.S. Schoenecker J.G. Differential development of the distal and proximal femoral epiphysis and physis in mice.Bone. 2013; 52: 337-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). In contrast, a secondary ossification center develops in the distal femoral epiphysis of the knee joint, and vessels can provide oxygen and nutrients to both ends of the growth plate. Therefore, cells in the resting zone of the PFE in CreTW animals may show a unique damage response to mtRC dysfunction compared with the knee joint epiphysis. Interestingly, scRNA-Seq analysis is suited to identify these cells and characterize their unique transcriptional response, and we found an increase in cell numbers of the unique populations in CreTW mice. This indicates that scRNA-Seq analysis also provides quantitative information on the cellular composition of tissue samples similar to flow cytometry experiments. scRNA-Seq analysis may therefore provide as a combined tool to determine individual transcriptomes and quantify cell populations to study regulated programs and changes in population composition. We observed a downregulation of mt-DNA–encoded subunits of mtRC complexes in CreTW mice compared with control. Interestingly, the decrease in expressi"
https://openalex.org/W3201204826,"TMPRSS13, a member of the type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) family, harbors four N-linked glycosylation sites in its extracellular domain. Two of the glycosylated residues are located in the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) protein domain, while the remaining two sites are in the catalytic serine protease (SP) domain. In this study, we examined the role of N-linked glycosylation in the proteolytic activity, autoactivation, and cellular localization of TMPRSS13. Individual and combinatory site-directed mutagenesis of the glycosylated asparagine residues indicated that glycosylation of the SP domain is critical for TMPRSS13 autoactivation and catalytic activity toward one of its protein substrates, the prostasin zymogen. Additionally, SP domain glycosylation-deficient TMPRSS13 displayed impaired trafficking of TMPRSS13 to the cell surface, which correlated with increased retention in the endoplasmic reticulum. Importantly, we showed that N-linked glycosylation was a critical determinant for subsequent phosphorylation of endogenous TMPRSS13. Taken together, we conclude that glycosylation plays an important role in regulating TMPRSS13 activation and activity, phosphorylation, and cell surface localization."
https://openalex.org/W3201658081,"Clinical and epidemiological studies support a role for vitamin D in suppressing hepatitis B virus (HBV). This antiviral role of vitamin D is widely attributed to vitamin D receptor (VDR)/retinoid X receptor-mediated regulation of host immunomodulatory genes through vitamin D response elements (VDREs) in their promoters. Here, we investigated the ability of calcitriol (1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, metabolically activated vitamin D) to directly regulate HBV activity through this signaling pathway. We observed that calcitriol selectively inhibited only the HBV core promoter without affecting the HBV-PreS1, HBV-PreS2/S, or HBx promoters. We then identified a VDRE cluster in the HBV core promoter that is highly conserved across most HBV genotypes. Disruption of this VDRE cluster abrogated calcitriol-mediated suppression of the HBV core promoter. Furthermore, we showed that VDR interacts directly with the VDRE cluster in the HBV core promoter independent of retinoid X receptor. This demonstrates that calcitriol inhibits HBV core promoter activity through a noncanonical calcitriol-activated VDR pathway. Finally, we observed that calcitriol suppressed expression of the canonical HBV core promoter transcripts, pregenomic RNA, and precore RNA in multiple HBV cell culture models. In addition, calcitriol inhibited the secretion of hepatitis B ""e"" antigen and hepatitis B surface antigen (HBV-encoded proteins linked to poor disease prognosis), without affecting virion secretion. Our findings identify VDR as a novel regulator of HBV core promoter activity and also explain at least in part the correlation of vitamin D levels to HBV activity observed in clinical studies. Furthermore, this study has implications on the potential use of vitamin D along with anti-HBV therapies, and lays the groundwork for studies on vitamin D-mediated regulation of viruses through VDREs in virus promoters."

However, the three-dimensional properties and catalytic mechanism of this enzyme are not known. Herein, we report the crystal structure of the JHAMT apoenzyme, the three-dimensional holoprotein in binary complex with its cofactor S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine, and the ternary complex with S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine and its substrate methyl farnesoate. These structures reveal the ultrafine definition of the binding patterns for JHAMT with its substrate/cofactor. Comparative structural analyses led to novel findings concerning the structural specificity of the progressive conformational changes required for binding interactions that are induced in the presence of cofactor and substrate. Importantly, structural and biochemical analyses enabled identification of one strictly conserved catalytic Gln/His pair within JHAMTs required for catalysis and further provide a molecular basis for substrate recognition and the catalytic mechanism of JHAMTs. These findings lay the foundation for the mechanistic understanding of JH biosynthesis by JHAMTs and provide a rational framework for the discovery and development of specific JHAMT inhibitors as insect growth regulators or insecticides."

Studies about the whole genome analysis of ZF-HD gene family have been reported in some plant species. In this study, the whole genome identification and expression profile of the ZF-HD gene family were analyzed for the first time in wheat. A total of 37 TaZF-HD genes were identified and divided into TaMIF and TaZHD subfamilies according to the conserved domain. The phylogeny tree of the TaZF-HD proteins was further divided into six groups based on the phylogenetic relationship. The 37 TaZF-HDs were distributed on 18 of 21 chromosomes, and almost all the genes had no introns. Gene duplication and Ka/Ks analysis showed that the gene family may have experienced powerful purification selection pressure during wheat evolution. The qRT-PCR analysis showed that TaZF-HD genes had significant expression patterns in different biotic stress and abiotic stress. Through subcellular localization experiments, we found that TaZHD6-3B was located in the nucleus, while TaMIF4-5D was located in the cell membrane and nucleus. Our research contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the TaZF-HD family, provides a new perspective for further research on the biological functions of TaZF-HD genes in wheat."

Traditional reversal potential assays are a reliable, general method for determining the transport stoichiometry of ion-coupled transporters, but the time and material costs of this technique hinder investigations of transporter behavior under multiple experimental conditions.

Our SSME method provides a fast, easy, general method for measuring transport stoichiometry, which will facilitate future mechanistic and functional studies of ion-coupled transporters. Ion-coupled (i.e., secondary active) transporters utilize energy stored in electrochemical gradients to drive uphill substrate transport across cellular membranes. These transporters are essential to numerous physiological processes, from nutrient uptake to neural signaling, and are common drug targets, but successful therapeutic design is limited by our understanding of these integral membrane proteins’ structures, functions, and mechanisms (1Garibsingh R.-A.A.

Transport stoichiometry—the number of ions and substrates moved per transport cycle—is a function of the transporter’s mechanism and is a crucial determinant of the direction of driven transport, the energy spent per substrate transported, and the maximum substrate gradient that can be maintained at equilibrium. Generally, ion-coupled transporters have been assumed to operate according to tightly coupled mechanisms with a single, set transport stoichiometry. This understanding has led to the traditional classification of transporters as antiporters, symporters, or uniporters. However, there is growing evidence that many ion-coupled transporters operate through complex mechanisms that violate the assumption of stoichiometric transport, engaging in behavior that cannot be cleanly classified as antiport, symport, or uniport (3Bazzone A.

Thus, measuring a transporter’s coupling stoichiometry not only sheds light on its biological functions, but also provides crucial information about the transport mechanism. The only way to reliably determine transport stoichiometry is through transport assays. Reversal potential assays have emerged as the method of choice for electrogenic transporters, as they are applicable to a variety of systems and allow for model-independent determination of the transport stoichiometry (18Fukuhara Y.

In brief, these assays follow transport as a function of membrane voltage for a set initial substrate and/or ion gradient. The reversal potential, the membrane voltage where there is no net transport, can be used to determine the transport stoichiometry. In theory, this method can be applied to any electrogenic transporter, but there are several important limitations. First, transport must be able to be monitored. Several eukaryotic transporters are amenable to patch clamp electrophysiology (23Ravera S. Virkki L.V. Murer H. Forster I.C. Deciphering PiT transport kinetics and substrate specificity using electrophysiology and flux measurements.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2007; 293: C606-C620Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 24Shao X.M. Kao L. Kurtz I. A novel delta current method for transport stoichiometry estimation.BMC Biophys. 2014; 7: 14Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar, 25Zerangue N. Kavanaugh M.P. Flux coupling in a neuronal glutamate transporter.Nature. 1996; 383: 634-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), but this technique is generally only suitable for high-flux transporters that can be highly expressed in eukaryotic cells, which excludes many structurally characterized prokaryotic transporters. Assays of purified protein in proteoliposomes allow for characterization of the widest range of transporters but require an appropriate readout of transport activity. Ideally, liposomal transport is observed through real-time probes such as fluorophores. However, fluorophores are not available for every coupling ion. Radioactive transport assays may be used instead (22Fitzgerald G.A. Mulligan C. Mindell J.A. A general method for determining secondary active transporter substrate stoichiometry.Elife. 2017; 6e21016Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) but do not offer real-time monitoring, significantly increasing the time and effort required to collect data for the multiple time points and conditions needed to determine transport stoichiometry. A second issue with traditional liposomal assays is that intraliposomal contents cannot easily be changed after reconstitution. This increases the difficulty of screening a wide range of assay conditions and can make it difficult to accurately establish internal ion and substrate concentrations. A third issue is that liposomal assays often require a large amount of purified transporters, depending on the sensitivity of the detection method and the number of conditions that must be tested. Finally, for many of the reasons listed above, traditional liposomal transport assays are low-throughput and require significant time and effort, even if the material costs can be kept to a minimum. As a consequence, transport stoichiometry has been measured for only a small fraction of structurally characterized transporters (22Fitzgerald G.A. Mulligan C. Mindell J.A. A general method for determining secondary active transporter substrate stoichiometry.Elife. 2017; 6e21016Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 26Groeneveld M. Slotboom D.J. Na(+):aspartate coupling stoichiometry in the glutamate transporter homologue Glt(Ph).Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 3511-3513Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). A method for routine measurements of transport stoichiometry would greatly facilitate functional and mechanistic studies of ion-coupled transporters. Here we present a new approach for measuring coupling stoichiometry by adapting reversal-potential assays to solid-supported membrane-based electrophysiology (SSME), a technique developed over the last 2 decades to allow electrophysiological characterization of lower flux transporters (27Bazzone A. Barthmes M. Fendler K. SSM-based electrophysiology for transporter research.Methods Enzymol. 2017; 594: 31-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 28Schulz P. Garcia-Celma J.J. Fendler K. SSM-based electrophysiology.Methods. 2008; 46: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). SSME carries several advantages over traditional liposomal transport assays. By directly measuring transported charge, SSME allows real-time monitoring of electrogenic transport without the need for fluorophores or radiolabeled substrates. In addition, its sensitivity requires only picomole amounts of protein to achieve sufficient signal. Finally, dozens of conditions can be tested on a single sensor without the need for separate reconstitutions, greatly increasing the throughput of the assay. We demonstrate the utility of this method using E. coli Gdx, whose 2:1 proton:guanidinium antiport stoichiometry was recently established using traditional reversal potential measurements (29Kermani A.A. Macdonald C.B. Gundepudi R. Stockbridge R.B. Guanidinium export is the primal function of SMR family transporters.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: 3060-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and CLC-ec1, which has been shown to engage in both tightly coupled and loosely coupled proton:anion transport (21Nguitragool W. Miller C. Uncoupling of a CLC Cl-/H+ exchange transporter by polyatomic anions.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 682-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). With our SSME assay, we confirmed these results, using less than 2 nmol total protein to perform 400 transport assays in under a week of measurement time. In addition, we demonstrate that it is possible to change the internal ion and substrate concentrations using the SSME setup, expanding the number of experimental conditions that can be tested on a single protein sample. This assay is fast, easy, and accurate, requires a minimal amount of sample, and is broadly applicable to electrogenic transporters, regardless of coupling ion or transported substrate. Reversal-potential assays rely on the thermodynamic reversibility of coupled transport. That is, transport of an ion down a large electrochemical gradient can drive transport of another substrate uphill against its electrochemical gradient, and conversely, transport of a substrate down a large gradient can drive transport of an ion up its electrochemical gradient. In this respect, the distinction between “ion” and “substrate” (which can be another ion) is semantic, though in a cellular context, the driving force is most commonly provided by the proton and/or sodium electrochemical gradients. When the electrochemical gradients are balanced, no net transport occurs, allowing for calculation of the transport stoichiometry (see Experimental procedures for equations and derivations). Our assay adapts this principle to SSME. In an SSME experiment, proteoliposomes are adsorbed onto a membrane-coated gold electrode, creating the sensor. To initiate an experiment, buffer is run over the sensor in three stages (27Bazzone A. Barthmes M. Fendler K. SSM-based electrophysiology for transporter research.Methods Enzymol. 2017; 594: 31-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). First, a “nonactivating” buffer containing the same solution as inside the liposomes is flowed over the sensor to ameliorate artifacts due to buffer perfusion. Second, an “activating” buffer is flowed over the sensor to initiate transport. Capacitive coupling between the liposomal membrane and the surface-supported membrane on the electrode allows for measurement of currents across the membrane (“on-currents”). Transport proceeds until a steady state is obtained where sufficient membrane potential opposes further net transport. Third, the nonactivating buffer is reapplied, and the reverse transport process returns the sensor to its initial state. During this phase, “off-current” transport proceeds in the opposite direction of the on-current, driven by both chemical and electrical gradients. Figure 1 shows representative traces from our assay for all three stages of the experiment. First, nonactivating buffer equilibrates the liposomes with a known concentration of proton and guanidinium. In the second stage, the activating buffer sets a twofold proton gradient to initiate transport. In Figure 1A, the guanidinium concentration is not changed, so there is no guanidinium gradient and the outward-facing proton gradient should drive guanidinium into the liposomes. The negative on-current indicates that charge is moving out of the liposome, consistent with the expected 2H+(out):1Gdm+(in) antiport (29Kermani A.A. Macdonald C.B. Gundepudi R. Stockbridge R.B. Guanidinium export is the primal function of SMR family transporters.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2018; 115: 3060-3065Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In Figure 1B, the activating buffer simultaneously sets an eightfold outward-facing guanidinium gradient in addition to the twofold outward-facing proton gradient. Under these conditions, the large guanidinium gradient drives uphill proton transport into the liposomes and reverses the direction of net charge movement. In the third and final stage, current flux in the opposite direction from the on-currents is observed when nonactivating buffer is reapplied to the sensor. While the off-currents in our experiments behave as expected qualitatively, we use only the on-currents for analysis following general practice in SSME data analysis (27Bazzone A. Barthmes M. Fendler K. SSM-based electrophysiology for transporter research.Methods Enzymol. 2017; 594: 31-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Both chemical gradients and transmembrane voltage contribute to the total electrochemical potential driving transport. In a traditional reversal-potential assay, chemical gradients are kept constant, and transport is observed as a function of applied membrane voltage. In contrast, there is no applied membrane voltage in our assays, and instead, chemical gradients are varied (30Turner R.J. Moran A. Stoichiometric studies of the renal outer cortical brush border membrane D-glucose transporter.J. Membr. Biol. 1982; 67: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Thus, we plot the observed transport (integrated on-current) as a function of the applied chemical gradients, denoted as the ratio of the initial substrate and ion chemical potentials (Δμs/Δμi). Null transport at a given Δμs/Δμi chemical potential ratio should correspond to an ion:substrate transport stoichiometry of the same value (see Experimental procedures for derivation). For Gdx’s 2H+:1Gdm+ transport stoichiometry, null transport should occur at a ΔμGdm+/ΔμH+ ratio of 2. We chose chemical potential ratios corresponding to a variety of plausible H+:Gdm+ stoichiometries (Table 1) to determine the extent to which different stoichiometries can be distinguished by our method.Table 1Gdx reversal assay conditionsFigureInternal conditionsExternal conditionsFigure 1pH 7.0pH 7.3pH 7.3pH 7.3pH 7.3pH 7.3pH 7.31 mM Gdm+1 mM Gdm+500 μM Gdm+353 μM Gdm+250 μM Gdm+125 μM Gdm+62.5 μM Gdm+ΔμGdm+(kJ/mol)01.72.63.45.16.8ΔμH+(kJ/mol)1.71.71.71.71.71.7Figure 2, B, C and EpH 6.7pH 7.0pH 7.0pH 7.0pH 7.01 mM Gdm+1 mM Gdm+500 μM Gdm+250 μM Gdm+125 μM Gdm+ΔμGdm+(kJ/mol)01.73.45.1ΔμH+(kJ/mol)1.71.71.71.7Figure 2, D and FpH 7.0pH 7.35pH 7.35pH 7.35pH 7.35500 μM Gdm+500 μM Gdm+223 μM Gdm+100 μM Gdm+44 μM Gdm+ΔμGdm+(kJ/mol)0246ΔμH+(kJ/mol)2222Potential ratio (ΔμGdm+/ΔμH+)013/2234 Open table in a new tab Before proceeding to our analysis, we performed several critical controls. To assess the magnitude of signal due to solution exchange, we ran the assay using sensors prepared with two negative controls: proteoliposomes reconstituted with the nonfunctional mutant E13Q-Gdx and “empty” liposomes reconstituted without transporters. Signals for both negative controls were of similar magnitude and small compared with transport signals for WT-Gdx (Fig. 1C and Fig. S3). As an additional control, we prepared sensors from liposomes with different lipid-to-protein ratios (LPR) but with the same total amount of lipid. Altering the protein concentration in this manner will not alter the thermodynamics of transport but will affect transport kinetics as well as pre-steady-state currents related to electrogenic partial reactions, such as substrate binding or protein gating (27Bazzone A. Barthmes M. Fendler K. SSM-based electrophysiology for transporter research.Methods Enzymol. 2017; 594: 31-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Since we are interested in transport stoichiometry, it is important to check that the currents reflect the full transport cycle and not just a partial reaction. Integrated currents for WT-Gdx are independent of LPR (Fig. 1D), as expected if the currents correspond to transport. Having confirmed that the currents reflect transport with the appropriate controls, we plotted transported charge as a function of chemical potential ratio. For both concentrations of WT-Gdx, null transport occurs at the expected 2:1 ΔμGdm+/ΔμH+ ratio (Fig. 1D). This result is unchanged when either the empty liposome or E13Q controls are subtracted. This confirms that our assay accurately measures the transport stoichiometry of Gdx. One key advantage of SSME over traditional liposomal assays is that one single SSM sensor allows dozens of measurements, drastically reducing sample requirements. Furthermore, it is well established that a single sensor can be used to screen different activating (external) buffers over several experiments (27Bazzone A. Barthmes M. Fendler K. SSM-based electrophysiology for transporter research.Methods Enzymol. 2017; 594: 31-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 31Schulz P. Dueck B. Mourot A. Hatahet L. Fendler K. Measuring ion channels on solid supported membranes.Biophys. J. 2009; 97: 388-396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). We wished to test whether it was possible to reliably change the internal buffer solution of the liposomes adsorbed to the sensors, which would greatly expand the number of conditions that could be tested on a single sensor and further increase the throughput of this method. We prepared sensors at pH 7.00 with 1 mM guanidinium in the same manner as in the experiments in Figure 1. We then performed a series of rinses with pH 6.70, 1 mM guanidinium buffer while monitoring the current. After about 3 ml of total rinse volume, the currents stabilized near zero (Fig. 2A). We then proceeded to perform the assay with a nominal internal pH of 6.70 and activating buffers at pH 7.00. The integrated current was plotted against chemical potential, assuming that the transmembrane pH gradient matched the nominal value. The graph once again yielded a transport stoichiometry of 2H+:Gdm+ (Fig. 2, C and E), confirming that the internal pH was 6.70, as intended. This demonstrates that a single sensor can be used to test multiple internal pH conditions. We then tested whether it is also possible to change the internal substrate concentrations. After preparing sensors with pH 7, 1 mM guanidinium buffer, we performed a series of three 1 ml rinses with pH 7.00, 500 μM guanidinium buffer, each separated by about 10 min, while monitoring the current. Several sensors required a fourth 1 ml rinse, but eventually, currents on all sensors stabilized near zero. Once the rinse currents stabilized at zero, we proceeded with the assay. The observed signal was lower overall, possibly the result of using lipids stocks that were 18 months old by the time of the experiment. Nevertheless, the signal trends were consistent with previous experiments, and once again, null transport occurred at the gradient ratio corresponding to 2H+:Gdm+ antiport (Fig. 2, D and F). This confirms that the internal Gdm+ was quantitatively exchanged on the sensor. These results provide evidence that internal substrate concentrations can be quantitatively exchanged on an SSME sensor, greatly expanding the possible range of experiments that can be performed using a single reconstitution of proteoliposomes. To determine whether the results of our assay with Gdx are generally applicable to other transporters, we next turned to CLC-ec1. This well-characterized transporter has previously been studied by SSME and is known to produce robust transport currents (32Garcia-Celma J. Szydelko A. Dutzler R. Functional characterization of a ClC transporter by solid-supported membrane electrophysiology.J. Gen. Physiol. 2013; 141: 479-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 33Walden M. Accardi A. Wu F. Xu C. Williams C. Miller C. Uncoupling and turnover in a Cl−/H+ exchange transporter.J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 129: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). CLC-ec1’s canonical function is tightly coupled 1H+:2Cl− antiport, but interestingly, it is also capable of transporting other anions with varying degrees of proton coupling (21Nguitragool W. Miller C. Uncoupling of a CLC Cl-/H+ exchange transporter by polyatomic anions.J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 362: 682-690Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). To test whether our SSME assay can accurately probe the effect of varied experimental conditions on transport stoichiometry, we performed a series of four reversal experiments with CLC-ec1 sensors (Table 2). Sensors with liposomes prepared from an identical reconstitution process without protein were used as negative controls.Table 2CLC-ec1 reversal assay conditionsFigureInternal conditionsExternal conditionsFigure 3 (blue)pH 4.84pH 5.24pH 5.24pH 5.24pH 5.24150 mM chloride150 mM chloride111 mM chloride95 mM chloride60 mM chlorideΔμCl−(kJ/mol)00.741.122.25ΔμH+(kJ/mol)2.262.262.262.26Figure 3 (red)pH 4.88pH 4.21pH 4.21pH 4.21pH 4.213 mM chloride3 mM chloride5 mM chloride6.5 mM chloride14 mM chlorideΔμCl−(kJ/mol)0−1.25−1.89−3.78ΔμH+(kJ/mol)−3.79−3.79−3.79−3.79Figure 4 (orange)pH 4.84pH 4.17pH 4.17pH 4.17pH 4.1715 mM nitrate15 mM nitrate25 mM nitrate32 mM nitrate70 mM nitrateΔμNO3−(kJ/mol)0−1.25−1.86−3.78ΔμH+(kJ/mol)−3.79−3.79−3.79−3.79Figure 4 (purple)pH 4.84pH 5.23pH 5.23pH 5.23pH 5.2315 mM nitrate15 mM nitrate11.2 mM nitrate9.6 mM nitrate6.1 mM nitrateΔμNO3−(kJ/mol)00.721.102.21ΔμH+(kJ/mol)2.202.202.202.20Potential ratio (Δμanion/ΔμH+)01/31/21 Open table in a new tab In the first set of experiments, the internal buffer matched the conditions of the reconstitution—pH 4.84 and 150 mM chloride. The external buffer was set to pH 5.24 and the external chloride concentration was varied to cover a range of possible proton:chloride stoichiometries (Fig. 3A and Table 2, row 1). Despite CLC-ec1’s high turnover rate, the observed signal did not reach a clear steady state under several experimental conditions. Instead, after an initial fast transport process, a slow but steady decrease could be observed in the integrated current traces (Fig. 3C). This decrease became more significant with larger chloride gradients, a phenomenon that was also observed with the empty liposome negative controls (Fig. 3E). This indicates that unlike with Gdx, a non-transporter-mediated process has a significant contribution to the signal, which must be taken into account when analyzing the data. Fortunately, the empty liposome control allows this signal to be isolated. Once isolated, background signals can be subtracted from sample signals to reveal the transporter-mediated signals in reversal potential assays (18Fukuhara Y. Turner R.J.

https://openalex.org/W3199352217,"Polyamines are fundamental molecules of life, and their deep evolutionary history is reflected in extensive biosynthetic diversification. The polyamines putrescine, agmatine, and cadaverine are produced by pyridoxal 5'-phosphate-dependent L-ornithine, L-arginine, and L-lysine decarboxylases (ODC, ADC, LDC), respectively, from both the alanine racemase (AR) and aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) folds. Two homologous forms of AAT-fold decarboxylase are present in bacteria: an ancestral form and a derived, acid-inducible extended form containing an N-terminal fusion to the receiver-like domain of a bacterial response regulator. Only ADC was known from the ancestral form and limited to the Firmicutes phylum, whereas extended forms of ADC, ODC, and LDC are present in Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Here, we report the discovery of ancestral form ODC, LDC, and bifunctional O/LDC and extend the phylogenetic diversity of functionally characterized ancestral ADC, ODC, and LDC to include phyla Fusobacteria, Caldiserica, Nitrospirae, and Euryarchaeota. Using purified recombinant enzymes, we show that these ancestral forms have a nascent ability to decarboxylate kinetically less preferred amino acid substrates with low efficiency, and that product inhibition primarily affects preferred substrates. We also note a correlation between the presence of ancestral ODC and ornithine/arginine auxotrophy and link this with a known symbiotic dependence on exogenous ornithine produced by species using the arginine deiminase system. Finally, we show that ADC, ODC, and LDC activities emerged independently, in parallel, in the homologous AAT-fold ancestral and extended forms. The emergence of the same ODC, ADC, and LDC activities in the nonhomologous AR-fold suggests that polyamine biosynthesis may be inevitable."
https://openalex.org/W3199603908,"Purpose Our aim was to examine the impact of a community-based exercise (CBE) intervention on cardiorespiratory fitness, cardiovascular health, strength, flexibility, and physical activity outcomes among adults living with HIV. Methods We conducted a longitudinal intervention study with community-dwelling adults living with HIV in Toronto, Canada. We measured cardiopulmonary fitness (V̇O 2 peak (primary outcome), heart rate, blood pressure), strength (grip strength, vertical jump, back extension, push-ups, curl ups), flexibility (sit and reach test), and self-reported physical activity bimonthly across three phases. Phase 1 included baseline monitoring (8 months); Phase 2 included the CBE Intervention (6 months): participants were asked to exercise (aerobic, strength, balance and flexibility training) for 90 minutes, 3 times/week, with weekly supervised coaching at a community-based fitness centre; and Phase 3 included follow-up (8 months) where participants were expected to continue with thrice weekly exercise independently. We used segmented regression (adjusted for baseline age and sex) to assess the change in trend (slope) among phases. Our main estimates of effect were the estimated change in slope, relative to baseline values, over the 6 month CBE intervention. Results Of the 108 participants who initiated Phase 1, 80 (74%) started and 67/80 (84%) completed the intervention and 52/67 (77%) completed the study. Most participants were males (87%), with median age of 51 years (interquartile range (IQR): 45, 59). Participants reported a median of 4 concurrent health conditions in addition to HIV (IQR: 2,7). Participants attended a median of 18/25 (72%) weekly supervised sessions. Change in V̇O 2 peak attributed to the six-month Phase 2 CBE intervention was 0.56 ml/kg/min (95% Confidence Interval (CI): -1.27, 2.39). Significant effects of the intervention were observed for systolic blood pressure (-5.18 mmHg; 95% CI: -9.66, -0.71), push-ups (2.30 additional push-ups; 95% CI: 0.69, 3.91), curl ups (2.89 additional curl ups; 95% CI: 0.61, 5.17), and sit and reach test (1.74 cm; 95% CI: 0.21, 3.28). More participants engaged in self-reported strength (p&lt;0.001) and flexibility (p = 0.02) physical activity at the end of intervention. During Phase 3 follow-up, there was a significant reduction in trend of benefits observed during the intervention phase for systolic blood pressure (1.52 mmHg/month; 95% CI: 0.67, 2.37) and sit and reach test (-0.42 cm/month; 95% CI: -0.68, -0.16). Conclusion Adults living with HIV who engaged in this six-month CBE intervention demonstrated inconclusive results in relation to V̇O 2 peak, and potential improvements in other outcomes of cardiovascular health, strength, flexibility and self-reported physical activity. Future research should consider features tailored to promote uptake and sustained engagement in independent exercise among adults living with HIV.

To understand the structural basis for the substrate translocation process, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of Meiothermus taiwanensis LonA (MtaLonA) in a substrate-engaged state at 3.6 Å resolution. Our data indicate that substrate interactions are mediated by the dual pore loops of the ATPase domains, organized in spiral staircase arrangement from four consecutive protomers in different ATP-binding and hydrolysis states. However, a closed AAA+ ring is maintained by two disengaged ADP-bound protomers transiting between the lowest and highest position. This structure reveals a processive rotary translocation mechanism mediated by LonA-specific nucleotide-dependent allosteric coordination among the ATPase domains, which is induced by substrate binding."
https://openalex.org/W3200395603,"Limb contractures are a debilitating and progressive consequence of a wide range of upper motor neuron injuries that affect skeletal muscle function. One type of perinatal brain injury causes cerebral palsy (CP), which affects a child's ability to move and is often painful. While several rehabilitation therapies are used to treat contractures, their long-term effectiveness is marginal since such therapies do not change muscle biological properties. Therefore, new therapies based on a biological understanding of contracture development are needed. Here, we show that myoblast progenitors from contractured muscle in children with CP are hyperproliferative. This phenotype is associated with DNA hypermethylation and specific gene expression patterns that favor cell proliferation over quiescence. Treatment of CP myoblasts with 5-azacytidine, a DNA hypomethylating agent, reduced this epigenetic imprint to TD levels, promoting exit from mitosis and molecular mechanisms of cellular quiescence. Together with previous studies demonstrating reduction in myoblast differentiation, this suggests a mechanism of contracture formation that is due to epigenetic modifications that alter the myogenic program of muscle-generating stem cells. We suggest that normalization of DNA methylation levels could rescue myogenesis and promote regulated muscle growth in muscle contracture and thus may represent a new nonsurgical approach to treating this devastating neuromuscular condition."
https://openalex.org/W3200478579,"Protein methylation is one of the most common post-translational modifications observed in basic amino acid residues, including lysine, arginine, and histidine. Histidine methylation occurs on the distal or proximal nitrogen atom of its imidazole ring, producing two isomers: Nτ-methylhistidine or Nπ-methylhistidine. However, the biological significance of protein histidine methylation remains largely unclear owing in part to the very limited knowledge about its contributing enzymes. Here, we identified mammalian seven-β-strand methyltransferase METTL9 as a histidine Nπ-methyltransferase by siRNA screening coupled with methylhistidine analysis using LC–tandem MS. We demonstrated that METTL9 catalyzes Nπ-methylhistidine formation in the proinflammatory protein S100A9, but not that of myosin light chain kinase MYLK2, in vivo and in vitro. METTL9 does not affect the heterodimer formation of S100A9 and S100A8, although Nπ-methylation of S100A9 at His-107 overlaps with a zinc-binding site, attenuating its affinity for zinc. Given that S100A9 exerts an antimicrobial activity, probably by chelation of zinc essential for the growth of bacteria and fungi, METTL9-mediated S100A9 methylation might be involved in the innate immune response to bacterial and fungal infection.

Given that S100A9 exerts an antimicrobial activity, probably by chelation of zinc essential for the growth of bacteria and fungi, METTL9-mediated S100A9 methylation might be involved in the innate immune response to bacterial and fungal infection. Thus, our findings suggest a functional consequence for protein histidine Nπ-methylation and may add a new layer of complexity to the regulatory mechanisms of post-translational methylation. In eukaryotic cells, one of the most common post-translational modifications (PTMs) is protein methylation, that is, the transfer of a methyl group from SAM to lysine and arginine residues in the target protein (1Hyun K. Jeon J. Park K. Kim J. Writing, erasing and reading histone lysine methylations.Exp. Mol. Med. 2017; 49e324Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar, 2Bhat K.P. Umit Kaniskan H. Jin J. Gozani O.

Lysine and arginine methylation consist of three distinct forms: monomethylation, dimethylation, and trimethylation of lysine and monomethylation, disymmetric methylation, and diasymmetric methylation of arginine. The functional significance of protein methylation has been extensively studied in histones, whose methylation plays a fundamental role in regulating gene expression and chromatin state (5Husmann D.

Regulation of histone arginine methylation/demethylation by methylase and demethylase (Review).Mol. Med. Rep. 2019; 19: 3963-3971PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, however, a growing body of evidence has established that methylation also occurs on nonhistone proteins and is involved in a widespread phenomenon that regulates diverse biological processes, including protein synthesis, mRNA splicing, and signal transduction (7Levy D. Lysine methylation signaling of non-histone proteins in the nucleus.Cell Mol. Life Sci. 2019; 76: 2873-2883Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 8Guccione E. Richard S. The regulation, functions and clinical relevance of arginine methylation.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2019; 20: 642-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). In addition to lysine and arginine, protein methylation of atypical residues, such as glutamine and histidine, is considered to have profound biochemical and physiological significance in eukaryotes (9Kwiatkowski S. Drozak J. Protein histidine methylation.Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2020; 21: 675-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 10Heurgue-Hamard V. Champ S. Mora L. Merkulova-Rainon T. Kisselev L.L.

Chem. 2005; 280: 2439-2445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Histidine can potentially be methylated on the nitrogen in either position 1 (Nπ) or 3 (Nτ) of the imidazole ring, producing the isomers Nπ-methylhistidine (also referred to as 1-methylhistidine) or Nτ-methylhistidine (3-methylhistidine), respectively (9Kwiatkowski S. Drozak J. Protein histidine methylation.Curr. Protein Pept. Sci. 2020; 21: 675-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Protein histidine methylation was first discovered as Nτ-methylhistidine in the constituents of actin and myosin from muscle proteins half a century ago (11Huszar G. Elzinga M. Homologous methylated and nonmethylated histidine peptides in skeletal and cardiac myosins.J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 745-753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Johnson P. Harris C.I. Perry S.V. 3-methylhistidine in actin and other muscle proteins.Biochem. J. 1967; 105: 361-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). After that, histidine methylation has been known for many years, but so far, there are only a few reports regarding histidine-methylated proteins: yeast ribosomal protein Rpl3 that carries an Nτ-methylhistidine (13Webb K.J. Zurita-Lopez C.I. Al-Hadid Q. Laganowsky A. Young B.D. Lipson R.S. Souda P. Faull K.F. Whitelegge J.P. Clarke S.G. A novel 3-methylhistidine modification of yeast ribosomal protein Rpl3 is dependent upon the YIL110W methyltransferase.J. Biol.

N pi-methylhistidine in myosin-light-chain kinase.Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1987; 368: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), and proinflammatory protein S100A9 (15Raftery M.J. Harrison C.A. Alewood P. Jones A. Geczy C.L. Isolation of the murine S100 protein MRP14 (14 kDa migration-inhibitory-factor-related protein) from activated spleen cells: Characterization of post-translational modifications and zinc binding.Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), both of which carry an Nπ-methylhistidine. However, a recent high-throughput proteomics analysis has successfully captured hundreds of proteins methylated at histidine residue in human cells, indicating that protein histidine methylation may be more prevalent type of PTM than predicted (16Ning Z. Star A.T. Mierzwa A. Lanouette S. Mayne J. Couture J.F. Figeys D. A charge-suppressing strategy for probing protein methylation.Chem. Commun. (Camb). 2016; 52: 5474-5477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The biggest obstacle to understanding the biological significance of histidine methylation is the lack of information about enzymes that catalyze methylhistidine formation. At present, however, the two distinct histidine-specific protein methyltransferases (MTases) have been identified in yeast and mice. The first one is yeast histidine protein MTase 1 that belongs to the seven-β-strand MTases responsible for the Nτ-methylation of His-243 in Rpl3 (13Webb K.J. Zurita-Lopez C.I. Al-Hadid Q. Laganowsky A. Young B.D. Lipson R.S. Souda P. Faull K.F. Whitelegge J.P. Clarke S.G.

Chem. 2010; 285: 37598-37606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), thereby contributing to the assembly of the large ribosomal subunit and translational elongation fidelity (17Al-Hadid Q. Roy K. Munroe W. Dzialo M.C. Chanfreau G.F. Clarke S.G. Histidine methylation of yeast ribosomal protein Rpl3p is required for proper 60S subunit assembly.Mol.

Methylation of yeast ribosomal protein Rpl3 promotes translational elongation fidelity.RNA. 2016; 22: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The second one is mouse SETD3 that belongs to the SET domain MTases responsible for the Nτ-methylation of His-73 in the actin and regulates contraction in uterine smooth muscle (19Wilkinson A.W. Diep J. Dai S. Liu S. Ooi Y.S. Song D. Li T.M. Horton J.R. Zhang X. Liu C. Trivedi D.V. Ruppel K.M. Vilches-Moure J.G. Casey K.M.

Vertommen D. Terreri M. Ishikawa T. Grabowska I. Tiebe M. Teleman A.A. Jagielski A.K. Veiga-da-Cunha M. Drozak J. SETD3 protein is the actin-specific histidine N-methyltransferase.Elife. 2018; 7e37921Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It should be noted that both enzymes are histidine Nτ-MTases, and there are no reports on enzymes that catalyze histidine Nπ-methylation so far. In this study, we established a new method that allows discrimination of the methylhistidine isomers of cellular proteins by using LC–MS/MS and combined it with an unbiased siRNA screen to identify molecules specifically required for histidine Nπ-methylation of S100A9. We found that mammalian seven-β-strand MTase METTL9 introduces Nπ-methylhistidine in S100A9, but not MLCK2, in vivo and in vitro. We also observed that METTL9 is localized predominantly to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), binding to and methylating S100A9. Furthermore, we demonstrated that METTL9-mediated methylation of S100A9 at His-107 did not affect its heterodimer formation with S100A8, whereas histidine methylation of recombinant S100A9 by METTL9 substantially decreases its binding affinity to zinc. Thus, our present findings show that METTL9 is a bona fide histidine Nπ-MTase in the ER and contributes to histidine Nπ-methylation of S100A9, reducing its zinc-binding ability. We believe that these findings have broad implications for not only the molecular basis of protein histidine methylation but also the biological function of METTL9. Histidine methylation can occur on the distal or proximal nitrogen atom of its imidazole ring, producing Nτ-methylhistidine or Nπ-methylhistidine, respectively (Fig. 1A). To identify the protein histidine MTase that catalyzes Nπ-methylhistidine in vivo, we developed a novel method to distinguish either the Nτ or Nπ histidine methylation of cellular proteins. First, a protein of interest is ectopically expressed as Flag-tagged forms in human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells and then immunopurified with Flag affinity resin, followed by acid hydrolysis and subsequent analysis of the resulting amino acids by LC coupled to tandem MS (LC–MS/MS). To verify the validity of this method, we selected two mammalian proteins, MLCK2 and S100A9, both of which are known to contain Nπ-methylhistidine residues (14Meyer H.E. Mayr G.W. N pi-methylhistidine in myosin-light-chain kinase.Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1987; 368: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 15Raftery M.J. Harrison C.A. Alewood P. Jones A. Geczy C.L. Isolation of the murine S100 protein MRP14 (14 kDa migration-inhibitory-factor-related protein) from activated spleen cells: Characterization of post-translational modifications and zinc binding.Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and performed the aforementioned experiment. Total protein hydrolysates of Flag-tagged mouse MLCK2 (Flag-MLCK2) showed a strong peak at the retention time of Nπ-methylhistidine, whereas no peak was observed for Nτ-methylhistidine (Fig. 1B). Similar results were observed in Flag-tagged mouse S100A9 (Flag-S100A9) protein, but it should be noted that the signal intensity of Nπ-methylhistidine was increased 6-fold when compared with that of Flag-MLCK2 protein (Fig. 1C). These data suggest the presence of a protein histidine Nπ-MTase(s) that targets MLCK2 and/or S100A9 in HEK293T cells and led us to identify the endogenous enzyme(s) using an siRNA screening approach. To this end, we adopted a Flag-S100A9 protein as a target substrate for enzyme screening because of its higher methylation efficiency than MLCK2. We prepared siRNA duplexes against the previously uncharacterized MTase genes, focusing on the sequence homology to yeast Hpm1 and mouse SETD3. As depicted in Figure 1D, HEK293T cells were transfected with siRNA pools targeting individual genes together with Flag-S100A9 expression plasmid, and then immunopurified Flag-S100A9 proteins were analyzed by LC–MS/MS. Of the 21 candidate genes, only METTL9 knockdown resulted in a marked decrease in the amount of Nπ-methylhistidine of S100A9, following the inhibition of METTL9 gene expression (Figs. 1E and S1). In contrast, knockdown of either SETD3 or METTL18, a putative human ortholog of yeast Hpm1, showed no noticeable change in the Nπ-methylhistidine levels of S100A9 (Fig. 1E). In this way, our screening approach identified METTL9 as a novel protein histidine MTase that specifically catalyzes the Nπ-methylhistidine formation of S100A9 in vivo. To test whether METTL9 directly methylates S100A9, we performed an in vitro methylation assay by measuring the incorporation of the [3H]-methyl group of [3H]-SAM into recombinant glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-fused S100A9. We detected the methylation signal of GST-S100A9 by fluorography only when incubated with GST-METTL9, and the signal was greatly enhanced against GST-cleaved S100A9 (Fig. 2A). Since we identified the “human” METTL9 gene as the responsible enzyme for histidine Nπ-methylation of “mouse” S100A9, we evaluated the species specificity of S100A9 methylation between humans and mice. We found that mouse S100A9, originally reported to contain Nπ-methylhistidine residue (15Raftery M.J. Harrison C.A. Alewood P. Jones A. Geczy C.L. Isolation of the murine S100 protein MRP14 (14 kDa migration-inhibitory-factor-related protein) from activated spleen cells: Characterization of post-translational modifications and zinc binding.Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), is a more favorable substrate than human ortholog, whereas the enzymatic activities of METTL9 are similar (Fig. 2B). Thus, we investigated the molecular function of mouse METTL9 in the methylation of mouse S100A9. First, we generated an MTase-inactive mutant of METTL9 by alanine substitution of Gly-153 and Gly-155 in the glycine-rich SAM-binding motif (referred to as 2GA) and showed that the 2GA mutant failed to methylate S100A9 (Fig. 2C). Since mouse S100A9 has been reported to be methylated at His-107 (15Raftery M.J. Harrison C.A. Alewood P. Jones A. Geczy C.L. Isolation of the murine S100 protein MRP14 (14 kDa migration-inhibitory-factor-related protein) from activated spleen cells: Characterization of post-translational modifications and zinc binding.Biochem. J. 1996; 316: 285-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), we replaced His-107 of S100A9 with phenylalanine and confirmed that this H107F mutation abolished METTL9-mediated methylation (Fig. S2). Next, to examine the substrate specificity of METTL9, we immunopurified Flag-tagged MLCK2 proteins from HEK293T cells and used them in an in vitro methylation assay. In contrast to S100A9, MLCK2 was not de novo methylated by METTL9, suggesting that S100A9 is a specific target of METTL9 (Fig. 2D). To further obtain evidence for histidine Nπ-MT activity of METTL9 in vitro, we employed LC–MS/MS to analyze recombinant S100A9 proteins, which were incubated with GST-METTL9 WT or 2GA mutant in the presence of nonradioisotope-labeled SAM. Consistent with the results of the siRNA screening (Fig. 1E), METTL9 selectively introduced Nπ-methylhistidine in S100A9 in vitro (Fig. 2E). Taken together, our data established METTL9 as a bona fide protein histidine Nπ-MT that directly methylates S100A9 at His-107. In addition to the classical 7BS MTase feature motif designated as DREV, METTL9 possesses a putative N-terminal signal peptide (residues 1–18) that often targets the nascent protein to the lumen of the ER (Fig. 3A) (21Braakman I. Hebert D.N. Protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5a013201Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). We therefore observed the subcellular localization of METTL9 by immunofluorescence staining for a C-terminal hemagglutinin-tagged mouse METTL9 (METTL9-HA) with a fluorescent marker for the ER (concanavalin A-conjugated Alexa Fluor 594). As expected, we found that METTL9-HA was localized mainly in the ER in both HEK293T and HeLa cells (Figs. 3B and S3, top). Unexpectedly, however, a deletion mutant lacking the signal peptide (hereafter, called METTL9ΔSP-HA) exhibited a partially aggregated but nearly identical distribution to that of the WT (Figs. 3B and S3, bottom). This observation implies that the ER localization of METTL9 occurs independently of its N-terminal sequence and led us to examine the possible functions of the N-terminal sequence. Thus, we first tested the interaction between METTL9ΔSP-HA and Flag-S100A9 in HEK293T cells. The coimmunoprecipitation assay showed that deletion of the N-terminal sequence of METTL9 appears not to influence its binding to S100A9 (Fig. 3C). To further reinforce the notion that the N-terminal sequence of METTL9 is not involved in the regulation of S100A9, we determined whether the METTL9ΔSP mutation affects the S100A9 methylation in vivo. We knocked down endogenous METTL9 in HEK293T cells and subsequently cotransfected with either WT or the ΔSP mutant of mouse METTL9-HA together with Flag-S100A9 expression plasmids. LC–MS/MS analysis demonstrated that, the Nπ-methylhistidine level of S100A9 was virtually abolished by METTL9 knockdown, whereas complementation of the knockdown cells with the METTL9ΔSP mutant and WT actually restored Nπ-methylhistidine to levels higher than those observed in S100A9 from control knockdown cells (Fig. 3D). In conclusion, these results indicate that the N-terminal sequence of METTL9 does not significantly contribute to its ER localization and methylation of S100A9 in cells. Finally, we attempted to uncover the functional significance of METTL9-mediated S100A9 methylation. Since S100A9 is known to form a heterodimeric complex with S100A8 through the EF-hand motifs, a central calcium-binding loop flanked by two a-helices (Fig. S4) (22Shabani F. Farasat A. Mahdavi M. Gheibi N. Calprotectin (S100A8/S100A9): A key protein between inflammation and cancer.Inflamm. Res. 2018; 67: 801-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we first examined the possibility that METTL9-mediated methylation may affect the formation of S100A8/S100A9 heterodimer in vivo. To this end, HEK293T cells expressing Flag-S100A9 were transfected with or without siRNA against METTL9, and their whole-cell lysates were used for pull-down assays using GST-fused mouse S100A8 (GST-S100A8). We showed that siRNA ablation of METTL9 did not affect the interaction between S100A9 and S100A8, despite a substantial decrease in the methylation levels of S100A9 (Figs. 4B and S5). To further confirm this result, we prepared recombinant S100A9 by cleavage of GST-S100A9, followed by an in vitro methylation reaction with GST-METTL9 in the presence or the absence of SAM, and then evaluated the binding affinity to GST-S100A8. In agreement with the results using cell lysates, we found that the S100A9–S100A8 interaction was not altered by de novo methylation (Fig. S6). Collectively, we concluded that Nπ-methylation of S100A9 at His-107 did not influence the heterodimerization of S100A8–S100A9. In addition to the Ca2+-binding EF-hand motifs involved in heterodimer formation, S100A8 and S100A9 are structurally characterized by a Zn2+-binding site that consists of the HxxxH motif (Fig. S4) (22Shabani F. Farasat A. Mahdavi M. Gheibi N. Calprotectin (S100A8/S100A9): A key protein between inflammation and cancer.Inflamm. Res. 2018; 67: 801-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 23Signor L. Paris T. Mas C. Picard A. Lutfalla G. Boeri Erba E. Yatime L. Divalent cations influence the dimerization mode of murine S100A9 protein by modulating its disulfide bond pattern.J. Struct. Biol. 2021; 213: 107689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). Mouse S100A9 contains two HxxxH motifs close to the C terminus. Interestingly, the second overlaps with the histidine residue that undergoes Nπ-methylation (Fig. S4): this prompted us to investigate whether METTL9-mediated methylation of S100A9 influences its zinc-binding ability. To this end, we synthesized an S100A9-derived peptide containing the second HxxxH motif (residues 98–113), as well as a methylated version of this peptide at His-107, and then compared their zinc-binding activity using metal-chelate chromatography on iminodiacetic acid equilibrated with zinc. Interestingly, only one histidine Nπ-methylation of the S100A9 peptide resulted in a significant reduction in zinc binding, suggesting that METTL9-mediated methylation modulates the zinc-binding ability of S100A9 (Fig. 4B). In this study, we discovered a new histidine Nπ-MT, METTL9, using siRNA screening followed by quantitative analysis of methylhistidine. This method is based on the chemical properties of protein methylation; unlike phosphorylation and acetylation, methyl amino acids, including methyl-histidine, methyl-lysine, and methyl-arginine, are stable even under acid hydrolysis conditions (6 N HCl at 110 °C for 24 h). LC–MS/MS analysis of the methylhistidine isomers enabled us to distinguish between Nτ histidine methylation and Nπ histidine methylation of cellular proteins. Because there are no available antibodies that specifically recognize protein histidine methylation, our approach could be a gold standard for assessing the methylation status of METTL9 substrates as well as screening novel protein histidine MTase(s). In preparation of this article, Davydova et al. (24Davydova E. Shimazu T. Schuhmacher M.K. Jakobsson M.E. Willemen H. Liu T. Moen A. Ho A.Y.Y. Malecki J. Schroer L. Pinto R. Suzuki T. Gronsberg I.A. Sohtome Y. Akakabe M. et al.The methyltransferase METTL9 mediates pervasive 1-methylhistidine modification in mammalian proteomes.Nat. Commun. 2021; 12: 891Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) have first reported that METTL9 is a broad-specificity MT that introduces Np-methylhistidine at His-x-His (where x is optimally a small residue) motifs in several different proteins. Thereafter, Lv et al. (25Lv M. Cao D. Zhang L. Hu C. Li S. Zhang P. Zhu L. Yi X. Li C. Yang A. Yang Z. Zhu Y. Zhang K. Pan W. METTL9 mediated N1-histidine methylation of zinc transporters is required for tumor growth.Protein Cell. 2021; https://doi.org/10.1007/s13238-021-00857-4Crossref Scopus (3) Google Scholar) also provided evidence for METTL9-mediated Np-methylhistidine formation and confirmed that METTL9 recognizes an x-His-x-His motif in the substrate protein. However, while their focuses were on METTL9 as one of the uncharacterized mammalian 7BS MTases, our present work set out to identify the enzymes responsible for histidine Np-methylation of S100A9 by using an unbiased siRNA screen (Fig. 1D). Notably, this approach allows exploring a novel MTase that catalyzes histidine methylation of previously reported protein, such as MLCK2 and myosin heavy chain (14Meyer H.E. Mayr G.W. N pi-methylhistidine in myosin-light-chain kinase.Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1987; 368: 1607-1611Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Because we have successfully detected Np-methylhistidine in immunopurified Flag-MLCK2 in HEK293T cells (Fig. 1B), it would be possible to obtain an MLCK2-histidine Nπ-methyltransferase from a genome-wide MTase siRNA library. We observed that METTL9-HA was localized exclusively in the ER in both HeLa and HEK293T cells (Figs. 3B and S2, top). Although it seems likely that subcellular localization of METTL9 was determined by a putative N-terminal signal peptide conserved across species, ablation of the sequence did not alter its ER localization, albeit more dot-like distribution than that of the WT (Figs. 3B and S2, bottom). Moreover, since the METTL9ΔSP mutant could bind and methylate S100A9 in cells, it remains unclear whether the N-terminal sequence plays a functional role in METTL9. Instead, we noted the potential PTMs of METTL9. As shown in Figure 3C, the immunoblot patterns of METTL9-HA showed an upper band shift above its estimated molecular size of 35 kDa, whereas no band shift was observed when the ΔSP mutant was expressed. Considering that the ER is an organelle in which N-linked glycosylation occurs (21Braakman I. Hebert D.N. Protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5a013201Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), the upper band shift may indicate N-linked glycosylation of METTL9. The N-terminal sequence appears to be required for this modification. Supporting this idea, METTL9 includes the putative N-linked glycosylation consensus motif Asn–x–Ser/Thr (where x can be any amino acid but proline) (21Braakman I. Hebert D.N. Protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2013; 5a013201Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Further investigation is needed to determine the significance of the N-terminal sequence in the METTL9 function. Our in vitro experiments demonstrated that Nπ-methylation at His-107 of S100A9 peptide resulted in the attenuation of zinc binding (Fig. 4C). This observation indicates that METTL9-mediated methylation modulates the zinc-binding activity of S100A9. The S100A8–S100A9 heterodimer, also called as calprotectin, is known to be abundant in the cytosol of circulating neutrophils and plays a prominent role in the bactericidal action through two regulatory mechanisms via zinc binding (26Miyasaki K.T. Bodeau A.L. Murthy A.R. Lehrer R.I. In vitro antimicrobial activity of the human neutrophil cytosolic S-100 protein complex, calprotectin, against Capnocytophaga sputigena.J. Dent. Res. 1993; 72: 517-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The first is an extracellular function of S100A8–S100A9, which exerts an antimicrobial activity, presumably by chelation of zinc, essential for the growth of bacteria and fungi (27Voganatsi A.

Microbiol. 2009; 55: 55-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The second is an intracellular function of zinc-induced (S100A8–S100A9) 2-tetramers, which have been shown to modulate tubulin polymerization and stabilization during migration of phagocytes (30Vogl T. Leukert N. Barczyk K. Strupat K. Roth J. Biophysical characterization of S100A8 and S100A9 in the absence and presence of bivalent cations.Biochim. Biophys.

https://openalex.org/W3199076216,"Purpose Government of Tamil Nadu, India, mandated the face mask wearing in public places as one of the mitigation measures of COVID-19. We established a surveillance system for monitoring the face mask usage. This study aimed to estimate the proportion of the population who wear face masks appropriately (covering nose, mouth, and chin) in the slums and non-slums of Chennai at different time points. Methods We conducted cross-sectional surveys among the residents of Chennai at two-time points of October and December 2020. The sample size for outdoor mask compliance for the first and second rounds of the survey was 1800 and 1600, respectively, for each of the two subgroups–slums and non-slums. In the second round, we included 640 individuals each in the slums and non-slums indoor public places and 1650 individuals in eleven shopping malls. We calculated the proportions and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) for the mask compliance outdoors and indoors by age, gender, region, and setting (slum and non-slum). Results We observed 3600 and 3200 individuals in the first and second surveys, respectively, for outdoor mask compliance. In both rounds, the prevalence of appropriate mask use outdoors was significantly lower in the slums (28%-29%) than non-slum areas (36%-35%) of Chennai (p&lt;0.01). Outdoor mask compliance was similar within slum and non-slum subgroups across the two surveys. Lack of mask use was higher in the non-slums in the second round (50%) than in the first round of the survey (43%) (p&lt;0.05). In the indoor settings in the 2 nd survey, 10%-11% among 1280 individuals wore masks appropriately. Of the 1650 observed in the malls, 947 (57%) wore masks appropriately. Conclusion Nearly one-third of residents of Chennai, India, correctly wore masks in public places. We recommend periodic surveys, enforcement of mask compliance in public places, and mass media campaigns to promote appropriate mask use."

Participants first completed the thinking style measure and then were exposed to two contradictory pieces of information (Studies 1 and 2). In study 2, we also measured the experience of mixed emotions to test the mediating role of this variable. Across two studies, we found that individuals with a holistic thinking style were more able to reconcile contradictory information compared to individuals with an analytic thinking style. Study 2 showed that the relationship between thinking style and dealing with contradiction was mediated by the experience of mixed emotions. This research extends previous findings on confrontation of contradiction and mixed emotions by using an individual-differences rather than a cultural-differences approach, and establishes mixed emotions as a plausible mediating variable."
https://openalex.org/W3200300164,"Objectives Some studies suggested more COVID-19-associated hospitalizations among racial and ethnic minorities. To inform public health practice, the COVID-19-associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) quantified associations between race/ethnicity, census tract socioeconomic indicators, and COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates. Methods Using data from COVID-NET population-based surveillance reported during March 1–April 30, 2020 along with socioeconomic and denominator data from the US Census Bureau, we calculated COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates by racial/ethnic and census tract-level socioeconomic strata. Results Among 16,000 COVID-19-associated hospitalizations, 34.8% occurred among non-Hispanic White (White) persons, 36.3% among non-Hispanic Black (Black) persons, and 18.2% among Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) persons. Age-adjusted COVID-19-associated hospitalization rate were 151.6 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 147.1–156.1) in census tracts with &gt;15.2%–83.2% of persons living below the federal poverty level (high-poverty census tracts) and 75.5 (95% CI: 72.9–78.1) in census tracts with 0%–4.9% of persons living below the federal poverty level (low-poverty census tracts). Among White, Black, and Hispanic persons living in high-poverty census tracts, age-adjusted hospitalization rates were 120.3 (95% CI: 112.3–128.2), 252.2 (95% CI: 241.4–263.0), and 341.1 (95% CI: 317.3–365.0), respectively, compared with 58.2 (95% CI: 55.4–61.1), 304.0 (95%: 282.4–325.6), and 540.3 (95% CI: 477.0–603.6), respectively, in low-poverty census tracts. Conclusions Overall, COVID-19-associated hospitalization rates were highest in high-poverty census tracts, but rates among Black and Hispanic persons were high regardless of poverty level. Public health practitioners must ensure mitigation measures and vaccination campaigns address needs of racial/ethnic minority groups and people living in high-poverty census tracts."
https://openalex.org/W3201026224,"Background In 2017 Public Health England and Sport England commissioned a Consultant-led Sport and Exercise Medicine (SEM) pilot to test the feasibility and acceptability of embedding physical activity interventions in secondary care clinical pathways. The aim of this paper is to report qualitative findings exploring the experience of healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients involved in the Active Hospital pilot. Methods Qualitative data was collected by semi-structured interviews with Active Hospital pilot SEM Consultants, and staff and patients involved in three clinical pathways. Interviews with SEM Consultants explored the experience of developing and implementing the pilot. Interviews with staff and patients explored the experience of delivering and receiving Active Hospital interventions. Data were analysed thematically. Results Interviews identified the importance of the Active Hospital pilot being Consultant-led for the following reasons; i) having trusting relationships with decision makers, ii) having sufficient influence to effect change, iii) identifying champions within the system, and iv) being adaptable to change and ensuring the programme fits within the wider strategic frameworks. HCPs emphasised the importance of the Active Hospital interventions fitting easily within existing work practices, the need for staff training and to tailor interventions for individual patient needs. The Active Hospital pilot was well received by patients, however a lack of dedicated resource and capacity to deliver the intervention was highlighted as a challenge by both patients and HCPs. Conclusion The SEM Consultants’ ability to navigate the political climate of a large National Health Service (NHS) Trust with competing agendas and limited resource was valuable. The interventions were well received and a valued addition to usual clinical care. However, implementation and ongoing delivery of the pilot encountered challenges including lack of capacity within the system and delays with recruiting to the delivery teams in each pathway."
https://openalex.org/W3200555265,"DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit (DNA-PKcs) is known primarily for its function in DNA double-stranded break repair and nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). However, DNA-PKcs also has a critical yet undefined role in immunity impacting both myeloid and lymphoid cell lineages spurring interest in targeting DNA-PKcs for therapeutic strategies in immune-related diseases. To gain insight into the function of DNA-PKcs within immune cells, we performed a quantitative phosphoproteomic screen in T cells to identify phosphorylation targets of DNA-PKcs. Our results indicate that DNA-PKcs phosphorylates the transcription factor Egr1 (early growth response protein 1) at serine 301. Expression of Egr1 is induced early upon T cell activation and dictates T cell response by modulating expression of cytokines and key costimulatory molecules such as IL (interleukin) 2, IL6, IFNγ, and NFκB. Inhibition of DNA-PKcs by treatment with a DNA-PKcs specific inhibitor NU7441 or shRNA knockdown increased proteasomal degradation of Egr1. Mutation of serine 301 to alanine via CRISPR-Cas9 reduced EGR1 protein expression and decreased Egr1-dependent transcription of IL2 in activated T cells. Our findings identify DNA-PKcs as a critical intermediary link between T cell activation and T cell fate and a novel phosphosite involved in regulating Egr1 activity."
https://openalex.org/W3200574457,"Bauhinia holophylla leaves, also known as ""pata-de-vaca"", are traditionally used in Brazil to treat diabetes. Although the hypoglycemic activity of this medicinal plant has already been described, the active compounds responsible for the hypoglycemic activity have not yet been identified. To rapidly obtain two fractions in large amounts compatible with further in vivo assay, the hydroalcoholic extract of B. holophylla leaves was fractionated by Vacuum Liquid Chromatography and then purified by medium pressure liquid chromatography combined with an in vivo Glucose Tolerance Test in diabetic mice. This approach resulted in the identification of eleven compounds (1-11), including an original non-cyanogenic cyanoglucoside derivative. The structures of the isolated compounds were elucidated by nuclear magnetic resonance and high-resolution mass spectrometry. One of the major compounds of the leaves, lithospermoside (3), exhibited strong hypoglycemic activity in diabetic mice at the doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg b.w. and prevents body weight loss. The proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) quantification revealed that the hydroalcoholic leaves extract contained 1.7% of lithospermoside (3) and 3.1% of flavonoids. The NMR analysis also revealed the presence of a high amount of pinitol (4) (9.5%), a known compound possessing in vivo hypoglycemic activity. The hypoglycemic properties of the hydroalcoholic leaves extract and the traditional water infusion extracts of the leaves of B. holophylla seem thus to be the result of the activity of three unrelated classes of compounds. Such results support to some extent the traditional use of Bauhinia holophylla to treat diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W3200935629,"The ability to automatically detect and classify populations of cells in tissue sections is paramount in a wide variety of applications ranging from developmental biology to pathology. Although deep learning algorithms are widely applied to microscopy data, they typically focus on segmentation which requires extensive training and labor-intensive annotation. Here, we utilized object detection networks (neural networks) to detect and classify targets in complex microscopy images, while simplifying data annotation. To this end, we used a RetinaNet model to classify genetically labeled neurons and glia in the brains of Mosaic Analysis with Double Markers (MADM) mice. Our initial RetinaNet-based model achieved an average precision of 0.90 across six classes of cells differentiated by MADM reporter expression and their phenotype (neuron or glia). However, we found that a single RetinaNet model often failed when encountering dense and saturated glial clusters, which show high variability in their shape and fluorophore densities compared to neurons. To overcome this, we introduced a second RetinaNet model dedicated to the detection of glia clusters. Merging the predictions of the two computational models significantly improved the automated cell counting of glial clusters. The proposed cell detection workflow will be instrumental in quantitative analysis of the spatial organization of cellular populations, which is applicable not only to preparations in neuroscience studies, but also to any tissue preparation containing labeled populations of cells."
https://openalex.org/W3199014350,"This study explored the physiological and molecular mechanisms of yield increase in maize under stable soil water content (SW) conditions. Results of the study showed that under SW conditions, corn yield increased by 38.72 and 44.09% in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Further, it was found that dry matter accumulation, economic coefficient and photosynthetic rate also increased by 31.24 and 25.67%, 5.45 and 15.38% as well as 29.60 and 31.83% in 2019 and 2020 respectively. However, the results showed that both the activity of antioxidant enzymes and content of osmotic adjustment substances decreased in maize under SW conditions. When compared with soil moisture content of dry and wet alternation (DW) conditions, SW could not only significantly promote growth and yield of maize but also increase the economic coefficient. Transcriptome profiles of maize leaves under the two conditions (SW and DW) were also analyzed and compared. It was found that 11 genes were highly up-regulated in the photosynthesis pathway. These genes included photosystem II protein V ( PsbE ), photosystem II protein VI ( PsbF ), photosystem II protein D1 ( PsbA ), photosystem II protein D2 ( PsbD ) and ATP synthase CF1 beta subunit ( atpB ). Further, it was found that four genes were up-regulated in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway., These were ATP synthase CF1 epsilon subunit ( atpE ), ATP synthase CF1 beta subunit ( atpB ), NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4L ( ndhE ) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 6 ( ndhG ). In conclusion, the physiological mechanism of stable soil water content (SW) to increase corn yield may be the enhancement of photosynthetic capacity and energy metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W3199181126,"Background Intraamniotic inflammation is associated with up to 40% of preterm births, most notably in deliveries occurring prior to 32 weeks’ gestation. Despite this, there are few treatment options allowing the prevention of preterm birth and associated fetal injury. Recent studies have shown that the small, non-competitive allosteric interleukin (IL)-1 receptor inhibitor, rytvela, may be of use in resolving inflammation associated with preterm birth (PTB) and fetal injury. We aimed to use an extremely preterm sheep model of chorioamnionitis to investigate the anti-inflammatory efficacy of rytvela in response to established intra-amniotic (IA) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) exposure. We hypothesized that rytvela would reduce LPS-induced IA inflammation in amniotic fluid (AF) and fetal tissues. Methods Sheep with a single fetus at 95 days gestation (estimated fetal weight 1.0 kg) had surgery to place fetal jugular and IA catheters. Animals were recovered for 48 hours before being randomized to either: i) IA administration of 2 ml saline 24 hours before 2 ml IA and 2 ml fetal intravenous (IV) administration of saline (Saline Group, n = 7); ii) IA administration of 10 mg LPS in 2 ml saline 24 hours before 2 ml IA and 2 ml fetal IV saline (LPS Group, n = 10); 3) IA administration of 10 mg LPS in 2 ml saline 24 hours before 0.3 mg/fetal kg IA and 1 mg/fetal kg fetal IV rytvela in 2 ml saline, respectively (LPS + rytvela Group, n = 7). Serial AF samples were collected for 120 h. Inflammatory responses were characterized by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), histology, fluorescent immunohistochemistry, enzyme-linked inmmunosorbent assay (ELISA), fluorescent western blotting and blood chemistry analysis. Results LPS-treated animals had endotoxin and AF monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 concentrations that were significantly higher at 24 hours (immediately prior to rytvela administration) relative to values from Saline Group animals. Following rytvela administration, the average MCP-1 concentrations in the AF were significantly lower in the LPS + rytvela Group relative to in the LPS Group. In delivery samples, the expression of IL-1β in fetal skin was significantly lower in the LPS + rytvela Group compared to the LPS Group. Conclusion A single dose of rytvela was associated with partial, modest inhibition in the expression of a panel of cytokines/chemokines in fetal tissues undergoing an active inflammatory response."
https://openalex.org/W3199470097,"Dermatophytosis is a common and highly contagious zoonotic skin disease in companion animals. This disease is a major concern in geographical areas that contain large numbers of stray animal populations. Numerous surveys on dermatophytosis among stray animal populations worldwide range between 27% to 50%. In recent years, the US territory of Puerto Rico was impacted by several natural disasters such as hurricanes, which has led to a large increase of abandonment cases and an increase in the stray animal population. Due to this, large low-cost spay/neuter clinics and trap-neuter-release programs have become a more common practice on the island. During these events, veterinary staff are exposed to multiple animals with no health history, and therefore, zoonotic diseases are of concern. The aim of this study was to provide information regarding the presence of dermatophyte species in symptomatic and asymptomatic stray dogs and cats in a region of Puerto Rico. Hair samples were collected from 99 stray animals with and without dermatological clinical signs. The hair samples were cultured on plates containing rapid sporulation medium and dermatophyte test medium. All cultures were evaluated microscopically to confirm the presence of dermatophytes. Then, all dermatophytes were further evaluated with MALDI-TOF MS to compare both diagnostic tests. A total of 19 animals (19%) were positive for dermatophyte growth. Of these animals, 18/19 were infected with M . canis and 1/19 with Trichophyton spp. Animals with clinical lesions were positive only 13.5% of the time compared to asymptomatic animals, who were positive in 36% of the sample population. All 19 dermatophytes (100%) diagnosed with microscopic evaluation were confirmed with MALDI-TOF MS. Our results indicate that there is a prevalence of 19% of dermatophytosis among the stray dog and cat population of the southeastern coast of the island."

Recently, a glycoside hydrolase family 1 (GH1) β-glucosidase, Os3BGlu6, was found to improve drought tolerance by stomatal closure in rice, but the biochemical functions of Os3BGlu6 have remained unclear. Here we identified Os3BGlu6 as a novel GH1 glucocerebrosidase (GCase) that catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucosylceramide to ceramide. Phylogenetic and enzymatic analyses showed that GH1 GCases are widely distributed in seed plants and that pollen or anthers of all seed plants tested had high GCase activity, but activity was very low in ferns and mosses. Os3BGlu6 had high activity for glucosylceramides containing (4E,8Z)-sphingadienine, and GCase activity in leaves, stems, roots, pistils, and anthers of Os3BGlu6-deficient rice mutants was completely absent relative to that of wild-type rice. The levels of ceramides containing sphingadienine were correlated with GCase activity in each rice organ and were significantly lower in Os3BGlu6-deficient rice mutants than in the wild type. The levels of LCBPs synthesized from ceramides, especially the levels of sphingadienine-1-phosphate, were also correlated with GCase activity in each rice organ and were significantly lower in Os3BGlu6-deficient rice mutants than in the wild type. These results indicate that Os3BGlu6 regulates the level of ceramides containing sphingadienine, influencing the regulation of sphingadienine-1-phosphate levels and subsequent improvement of drought tolerance via stomatal closure in rice."
https://openalex.org/W3201336313,"Background Balance and functional strength training can improve muscle strength and physical functioning outcomes and decrease the risk of falls in older adults. To maximize the benefits of strength training, adequate protein intake is also important. However, the number of older individuals that consume enough protein or routinely engage in strength training remains low at less than 5% and even lower for activities that challenge balance. Our primary aim was to assess the feasibility of implementing a model (MoveStrong) of service delivery to teach older adults about balance and functional strength training and methods to increase protein intake. Methods This study was a closed cohort stepped wedge randomized controlled trial. We recruited individuals ≥60 years considered pre-frail or frail with at least one chronic condition who were not currently engaging in regular strength training from Northern (rural) and Southern (urban) Ontario sites in Canada. The primary outcome was feasibility of implementation, defined by recruitment, retention, and adherence, and safety (defined by monitoring adverse events). We also reported participants’ and providers’ experience with MoveStrong, adaptations to the model based on participant’s and provider’s experience, and program fidelity. Results We recruited 44 participants to the study and the average adherence rate was 72% with a retention of 71%. The program had a high-fidelity score. One person experienced a fall-related injury during exercise, while two other participants reported pain during certain activities. Five individuals experienced injuries or health problems that were not related to the program. Suggestions for future trials include modifying some exercises, exploring volunteer assistance, increasing the diversity of participants enrolled, and considering a different study design. Conclusions Our pilot trial demonstrates the feasibility of recruitment and adherence for a larger multisite RCT of balance and functional strength training with attention to protein intake in pre-frail and frail older adults."

This year’s Lasker∼Debakey Clinical Research Award honors Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman for the development of a therapeutic technology based on nucleoside-modification of messenger RNA, enabling the rapid development of the highly effective COVID-19 vaccines. By March of 2020, people across the world were slowly coming to the realization that their daily lives were about to change. A deadly pandemic was circling the globe. Other than the identification of a coronavirus as the likely culprit, we lacked knowledge of and immunity to the virus and had neither therapeutics nor vaccines to combat its spread and save lives. As we write this article, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is thought to have caused the death of 4.3 million people and sickened 208 million, and this is surely an underestimate. Due to an extraordinary feat of rapid vaccine design, development, manufacture, and distribution, just 15 months after the onset of the pandemic, the global community is gaining some semblance of traction, albeit progress is geographically uneven. Novel and highly effective vaccines based on nucleoside-modified messenger RNA (mRNA) encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles, designed and developed at breakneck speed, have become the major factor in controlling the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). How was it possible to create these novel vaccines in less time than any other vaccine in history? Where did these vaccines come from and what was the foundational science on which they are based? One of the challenges that we in the scientific community face is communicating to the public how basic research benefits society at large. How do years of inquiry devoted to seemingly obscure problems contribute to the public good? Every once in a while a discovery is made that in the fullness of time has a truly obvious and dramatic impact on humankind. Such is the case for the groundbreaking contributions of Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman who have been honored by the 2021 Lasker∼DeBakey Clinical Research Award. Their sustained efforts in adapting mRNA as a platform for producing therapeutic proteins in host cells are what enabled fast development of highly effective vaccines against the pandemic-causing SARS-CoV-2. These vaccines are having, and already have had, a major impact on the health of many millions of people around the world. Karikó was born in Hungary where she obtained her PhD in biochemistry. In 1985, she moved to the United States as a postdoctoral fellow at Temple University in Philadelphia, where she began her long journey in adapting mRNA to therapeutic use, carrying out clinical research based on triggering interferon production with double-stranded RNA. As a research assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine (now called the Perelman School of Medicine), she focused her efforts on using in vitro-synthesized mRNAs encoding therapeutic proteins for treating acute diseases. Even as Karikó faced many obstacles in her initial efforts at adapting synthetic mRNAs for use in cell cultures, she was unable to gain funding for the work and was demoted from her faculty position to senior research investigator. She exhibited remarkable resilience and persevered in her pursuit of an effective mRNA therapeutic. The game-changer was a fortuitous encounter with a newly arrived immunologist, Drew Weissman, who had received his MD and PhD from Boston University in 1987. Weissman came to the University of Pennsylvania in 1997 from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, where he had trained as a fellow (later a senior staff fellow) under the supervision of Anthony Fauci who, in an unexpected coincidence, would become a principal spokesman on the control of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. As colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Karikó and Weissman discovered they had a common interest in the delivery of synthetic mRNA to generate highly targeted therapeutic proteins. Although work on delivering therapeutic proteins using mRNA had been going on for decades in multiple labs, Karikó’s and Weissman’s complementary skills and expertise led to the breakthrough that enabled the rapid development of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. Early on, Karikó and Weissman focused on using in vitro-synthesized mRNAs to direct the production of therapeutic proteins by delivering the mRNAs exogenously into cells in culture with cationic lipids. A critical obstacle they encountered was that synthetic mRNA was highly immunogenic in human dendritic cells of the innate immune system, triggering the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines (Ni et al., 2002Ni H. Capodici J. Cannon G. Communi D. Boeynaems J.-M. Karikó K. Weissman D. Extracellular mRNA induces dendritic cell activation by stimulating tumor necrosis factor-α secretion and signaling through a nucleotide receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 12689-12696Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). As early as 2000, Karikó and Weissman published that transfection of dendritic cells with mRNA for the HIV polyprotein Gag induced a potent immune response, primarily through recognition of double-stranded regions of the RNA. In 2004 they reported that small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting viral genes during herpes simplex virus infection compromised therapeutic effects by activating Toll-like receptor TLR3 (one of the basic signaling receptors of the innate immune system) to induce type 1 interferon and enhance RNA degradation (Karikó et al., 2004Karikó K. Ni H. Capodici J. Lamphier M. Weissman D. mRNA is an endogenous ligand for Toll-like receptor 3.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 12542-12550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). Several other research groups that had tried to use siRNAs as therapeutics also encountered the problem of RNA instability, and two groups (Diebold et al., 2004Diebold S.S. Kaisho T. Hemmi H. Akira S. Reis e Sousa C. Innate antiviral responses by means of TLR7-mediated recognition of single-stranded RNA.Science. 2004; 303: 1529-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (2757) Google Scholar; Heil et al., 2004Heil F. Hemmi H. Hochrein H. Ampenberger F. Kirschning C. Akira S. Lipford G. Wagner H. Bauer S. Species-specific recognition of single-stranded RNA via toll-like receptor 7 and 8.Science. 2004; 303: 1526-1529Crossref PubMed Scopus (3085) Google Scholar) reported that single-stranded RNA was recognized by Toll-like receptors. A key early observation was that whereas synthetic RNAs triggered proinflammatory cytokine production, some naturally occurring RNAs, such as transfer RNAs (tRNAs), which were used as a control, did not (Koski et al., 2004Koski G.K. Karikó K. Xu S. Weissman D. Cohen P.A. Czerniecki B.J. Cutting edge: innate immune system discriminates between RNA containing bacterial versus eukaryotic structural features that prime for high-level IL-12 secretion by dendritic cells.J. Immunol. 2004; 172: 3989-3993Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). tRNAs are known to be rich in modified nucleosides (up to 25% of the nucleosides in tRNA are modified). The penny dropped when Karikó and Weissman realized that modified nucleosides might camouflage RNA from the innate immune system. In a seminal 2005 paper in Immunity, Karikó and Weissman reported that mRNAs synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase and a wide variety of modified nucleotide substrates reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines from monocyte-derived dendritic cells. Notably, uridine derivatives (such as 5-methyluridine, 2-thiouridine, and pseudouridine) abolished the capacity of mRNA to activate primary, blood-derived dendritic cells (Karikó et al., 2005Karikó K. Buckstein M. Ni H. Weissman D. Suppression of RNA recognition by Toll-like receptors: the impact of nucleoside modification and the evolutionary origin of RNA.Immunity. 2005; 23: 165-175Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1230) Google Scholar). mRNA-mediated immune stimulation was suppressed proportionally to the number of modified nucleosides present in mRNA but even the presence of a few modified nucleosides exerted a suppressive effect. In what proved to be prescient, the authors noted at the end of their 2005 paper that the results of their study would be essential to the “design of therapeutic RNAs.” Importantly, in later work, Karikó and Weissman went on to show that incorporation of pseudouridine (henceforth Ψ) not only reduced immunogenicity but also significantly increased translation of synthetic mRNAs both in vitro and in mice (Karikó et al., 2008Karikó K. Muramatsu H. Welsh F.A. Ludwig J. Kato H. Akira S. Weissman D. Incorporation of pseudouridine into mRNA yields superior nonimmunogenic vector with increased translational capacity and biological stability.Mol. Ther. 2008; 16: 1833-1840Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (797) Google Scholar). In toto, these results showed that modified mRNA could be used to produce high levels of proteins of interest without triggering strong inflammatory responses. Also, and at about the same time, Barry Polisky, founder of Sirna Therapeutics, made siRNA that was chemically modified (in which the 2′-hydroxyl groups were substituted with methoxy or fluoro residues) to increase the stability of the RNA. These investigators showed that when the modified siRNA was encapsulated in lipid and then introduced into a mouse model for hepatitis B virus infection, the alterations to the 2′-hydroxyl groups lowered cytotoxicity and immunostimulatory side effects (Morrissey et al., 2005Morrissey D.V. Lockridge J.A. Shaw L. Blanchard K. Jensen K. Breen W. Hartsough K. Machemer L. Radka S. Jadhav V. et al.Potent and persistent in vivo anti-HBV activity of chemically modified siRNAs.Nat. Biotechnol. 2005; 23: 1002-1007Crossref PubMed Scopus (1016) Google Scholar). The early publications from Karikó and Weissman garnered limited attention, but were noticed by a former young faculty member at the Harvard Medical School, Derrick Rossi. Rossi, who was studying stem cells, came across the Karikó and Weissman 2005 paper and used its findings to great success in his own research, delivering the four Yamanaka factors into adult human cells to achieve efficient reprogramming into induced pluripotent stem cells (Warren et al., 2010Warren L. Manos P.D. Ahfeldt T. Loh Y.-H. Li H. Lau F. Ebina W. Mandal P.K. Smith Z.D.

Rossi’s accomplishments based on using synthetic mRNAs with modified nucleosides did attract a lot of attention. He sought and received venture funding for a startup company named Moderna (for “modified RNA”), which was founded in the United States in 2010, with the goal of developing mRNA therapeutics. Moderna licensed patents that had been filed by the University of Pennsylvania based on the discoveries of Karikó and Weissman. (Rossi left Moderna in 2014 to focus on other entrepreneurial activities.) Meanwhile, another start-up company, BioNTech, which was founded in Germany in 2008 by Uğur Şahin and Özlem Türeci, also embraced nucleoside-modified mRNA, licensing the patents to the Karikó and Weissman technology. BioNTech’s goal was to create a vehicle for a personalized cancer vaccine using specific tumor antigens. By 2015, BioNTech, where, at this point, Karikó had been appointed as a senior vice president, had expanded their original focus from developing vaccines for cancer immunotherapy to viral vaccine development. Meanwhile, Moderna, in 2013, had begun using Karikó’s and Weissman’s modified mRNA technology to create vaccines for Zika, chikungunya, and cytomegalovirus, as well a passive immunization using monoclonal antibodies. The ability of BioNTech and Moderna to adapt mRNA as a vaccine against viral infections came only after years of work demonstrating that non-inflammatory, nucleoside-modified mRNAs could be translated at high levels in cells in culture and in mice, and, most importantly, the demonstration that the newly developed platform could be used therapeutically. By 2012, Karikó and Weissman reported that mice injected with lipid-complexed with in vitro-synthesized, nucleoside-modified mRNAs (in which uridine was replaced with Ψ) encoding erythropoietin elicited the production of elevated serum levels of the hormone as early as 6 h after injection (Karikó et al., 2012Karikó K. Muramatsu H. Keller J.M. Weissman D. Increased erythropoiesis in mice injected with submicrogram quantities of pseudouridine-containing mRNA encoding erythropoietin.Mol. Ther. 2012; 20: 948-953Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). This increase in erythropoietin levels was accompanied by a significant increase in reticulocytes and hematocrits. Similar results were obtained with non-human primates. The same coding sequence with unmodified uridine produced 10- to 100-fold lower levels of erythropoietin. During 2017 and 2018, Karikó and Weissman, working with postdoctoral fellow Norbert Pardi (who was later to join the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine), published a series of seminal papers demonstrating the use of modified mRNA as an anti-viral vaccine in mice and non-human primates. Protection against Zika virus infection was obtained by a single injection of lipid nanoparticles with 1-methylpseudouridine (m1Ψ)-containing mRNA encoding a virus antigen (Pardi et al., 2017Pardi N. Hogan M.J. Pelc R.S. Muramatsu H. Andersen H. DeMaso C.R. Dowd K.A. Sutherland L.L. Scearce R.M. Parks R. et al.Zika virus protection by a single low-dose nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccination.Nature. 2017; 543: 248-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). The lipid nano particles enabled fusion with the host cells and also proved to be an effective adjuvant. The vaccine elicited a potent and durable neutralizing antibody response to the Zika envelope glycoproteins. Because the Zika virus epidemic occurred in 2013, and the success of this vaccine candidate was not reported until 2017, human trials were not possible as by then the epidemic had abated and there were too few susceptible individuals for a meaningful trial. The following year, Pardi, Karikó, and Weissman went on to successfully use m1Ψ-containing mRNA encoding viral surface antigens to HIV, Zika, and influenza to elicit potent immune responses in mice and non-human primates (Pardi et al., 2018aPardi N. Hogan M.J. Naradikian M.S. Parkhouse K. Cain D.W. Jones L. Moody M.A. Verkerke H.P. Myles A. Willis E. et al.Nucleoside-modified mRNA vaccines induce potent T follicular helper and germinal center B cell responses.J. Exp. Med. 2018; 215: 1571-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). In an attempt to raise antibodies to a conserved region of the stalk portion of the influenza surface haemagglutinin, they were able to achieve robust antigen-specific vaccination with modified mRNA in mice, rabbits, and ferrets (Pardi et al., 2018bPardi N. Parkhouse K. Kirkpatrick E. McMahon M. Zost S.J. Mui B.L. Tam Y.K. Karikó K. Barbosa C.J. Madden T.D. et al.Nucleoside-modified mRNA immunization elicits influenza virus hemagglutinin stalk-specific antibodies.Nat. Commun. 2018; 9: 3361Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In sum, this important series of investigations established the potential utility of mRNA as a therapeutic platform, including for vaccines against viral diseases. Just as all of this progress in mRNA vaccine platforms had come into place, in January of 2020 Chinese scientists made public the sequence of the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, responsible for the alarming number of infections spreading worldwide. Remarkably, promising mRNA vaccine candidates were able to move from proof-of-concept to FDA Emergency Use Authorization in just 1 year. How was this possible? Both Moderna and BioNTech acted immediately to adapt the RNA technology already in house to design a vaccine based on modified mRNAs encoding the virus’s spike protein, as shown in Figure 1. Moderna, which was a small company that had not yet had a drug on the market, sought and received funding from US government sources. Simultaneously, BioNTech closed a deal with Pfizer to fund development, clinical trials, and manufacturing of a COVID-19 vaccine. BioNTech and Pfizer optimized a modified mRNA-lipid nano particle vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein that triggered strong production of neutralizing antibodies. Employing good manufacturing practice standards of production, this vaccine candidate was rapidly moved through clinical trials. The critical paper reporting the safety and efficacy of a m1Ψ-containing mRNA encoding the spike protein as a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 was published in December of 2020 at the height of the pandemic. The results of this phase 3 trial with 43,548 people were a resounding success. Papers reporting the COVID-19 vaccine were authored by teams of researchers at both the University of Pennsylvania and BioNTech (Polack et al., 2020Polack F.P. Thomas S.J. Kitchin N. Absalon J. Gurtman A. Lockhart S. Perez J.L. Pérez Marc G. Moreira E.D. Zerbini C. et al.C4591001 Clinical Trial GroupSafety and efficacy of the BNT162b2 mRNA Covid-19 vaccine.N. Engl. J.

Maurus D. et al.COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b1 elicits human antibody and TH1 T cell responses.Nature. 2020; 586: 594-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar). Although there are many heroes in this story, Karikó and Weissman led the way to rapid generation of COVID-19 vaccines by creating a safe and effective platform based on modified mRNAs for producing therapeutic proteins. This technology has revolutionized vaccinology. Under FDA Emergency Use Authorization, the modified mRNA vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 from Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech are saving the lives of countless numbers of people worldwide and are a major factor in quelling the COVID-19 pandemic. Looking to the future, there will be other pandemics. It is not a question of if but when other highly transmissible coronaviruses, deadly influenza viruses, or as yet unknown pathogens appear on the horizon. Fortunately, the modified mRNA vaccine strategy is highly versatile because target antigen sequences can be easily and rapidly tailored to match newly emerging viral, parasitic, or bacterial pathogens. The discovery and implementation of mRNA vaccines will continue to have an enormous impact on global health.

However, the effect of Gal-1 on mortality and acute kidney injury (AKI) in critically-ill patients remain unclear. Methods From May 2018 to March 2020, 350 patients admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) of Taipei Veterans General Hospital, a tertiary medical center, were enrolled in this study. Forty-one patients receiving long-term renal replacement therapy were excluded. Serum Gal-1 levels were determined within 24 h of ICU admission. The patients were divided into tertiles according to their serum Gal-1 levels (low, serum Gal-1 &lt; 39 ng/ml; median, 39–70 ng/ml; high, ≥71 ng/ml). All patients were followed for 90 days or until death. Results Mortality in the ICU and at 90 days was greater among patients with elevated serum Gal-1 levels. In analyses adjusted for the body mass index, malignancy, sepsis, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and serum lactate level, the serum Gal-1 level remained an independent predictor of 90-day mortality [median vs. low: adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 2.11, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24–3.60, p = 0.006; high vs. low: aHR 3.21, 95% CI 1.90–5.42, p &lt; 0.001]. Higher serum Gal-1 levels were also associated with a higher incidence of AKI within 48 h after ICU admission, independent of the SOFA score and renal function (median vs. low: aHR 2.77, 95% CI 1.21–6.34, p = 0.016; high vs. low: aHR 2.88, 95% CI 1.20–6.88, p = 0.017). The results were consistent among different subgroups with high and low Gal-1 levels. Conclusion Serum Gal-1 elevation at the time of ICU admission were associated with an increased risk of mortality at 90 days, and an increased incidence of AKI within 48 h after ICU admission."

https://openalex.org/W3199005775,"The norovirus genome consists of a single positive-stranded RNA. The mechanism by which this single-stranded RNA genome is replicated is not well understood. To reveal the mechanism underlying the initiation of the norovirus genomic RNA synthesis by its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), we used an in vitro assay to detect the complementary RNA synthesis activity. Results showed that the purified recombinant RdRp was able to synthesize the complementary positive-sense RNA from a 100-nt template corresponding to the 3'-end of the viral antisense genome sequence, but that the RdRp could not synthesize the antisense genomic RNA from the template corresponding to the 5'-end of the positive-sense genome sequence. We also predicted that the 31 nt region at the 3'-end of the RNA antisense template forms a stem-loop structure. Deletion of this sequence resulted in the loss of complementary RNA synthesis by the RdRp, and connection of the 31 nt to the 3'-end of the inactive positive-sense RNA template resulted in the gain of complementary RNA synthesis by the RdRp. Similarly, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay further revealed that the RdRp bound to the antisense RNA specifically, but was dependent on the 31 nt at the 3'-end. Therefore, based on this observation and further deletion and mutation analyses, we concluded that the predicted stem-loop structure in the 31 nt end and the region close to the antisense viral genomic stem sequences are both important for initiating the positive-sense human norovirus genomic RNA synthesis by its RdRp."

Since it has been reported that several types of eicosanoids, such as non-enzymatic oxidation product of arachidonic acid isoprostane, act as a TP ligand, there is a possibility that some other eicosanoids contribute to the TP-mediated nasal obstruction. The aim of this study is to investigate the mechanisms of TP-mediated nasal obstruction. Intranasal challenges of ovalbumin (OVA) induced nasal obstruction in mice. Pharmacological blockade of TP receptor but not thromboxane A2 synthase inhibited OVA-induced nasal obstruction. Simultaneous analysis of eicosanoids in nasal lavage fluid and the responses in trans-endothelial resistance suggested that 8-iso-prostaglandin E2 (PGE2 ) can be a candidate for TP ligand. Intranasal challenge of 8-iso-PGE2 induced vascular hyperpermeability and nasal obstruction in TP receptor-dependent manner. Wholemount immunostaining of nasal septum mucosa revealed that 8-iso-PGE2 increased plasma leakage accompanied by distention of venous sinusoids. This study shows that 8-iso-PGE2 is a contributor in TP-mediated nasal obstruction in mice."
https://openalex.org/W3199549314,"Spray-dried animal plasma (SDP) in feed for several animal species provides health benefits, but research about use of SDP in shrimp feed is very limited. The objectives of the present study were to investigate the effects of dietary SDP on growth performance, feed utilization, immune responses, and prevention of Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection in Pacific white shrimp ( Litopenaeus vannamei ). In Experiment 1, the post-larvae were divided into five groups (four tank/group and 80 shrimp/tank) and fed four times daily diets with porcine SDP at 0, 1.5, 3, 4.5, and 6% of the diet for 45 days. In Experiment 2, the surviving shrimp from Experiment 1 were redistributed into six groups: four SDP groups as in Experiment 1 plus the positive and negative controls (four tank/group and 30 shrimp/tank). They were then challenged with V . parahaemolyticus by immersion at 10 5 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL and were fed with the same diets for another 4 days. In Experiment 1, shrimp fed 4.5% or 6% SDP diets had significantly higher body weight, survival rate, and improved feed conversion ratio. The immune parameters (total hemocyte count and phagocytic, phenoloxidase, and superoxide dismutase activities) of the shrimp fed 3–6% SDP diets also showed significant enhancement compared to the control. In Experiment 2, the survival rates of the 3–6% SDP groups were significantly higher than the positive control at day 4 after the immersion challenge. Likewise, the histopathological study revealed milder signs of bacterial infection in the hepatopancreas of the 3–6% SDP groups compared to the challenged positive control and 1.5% SDP groups. In conclusion, shrimp fed diets with SDP, especially at 4.5–6% of the diet, showed significant improvement in overall health conditions and better resistance to V . parahaemolyticus infection."
https://openalex.org/W3201510615,"Approximately 5–7% of non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cases harbor an anaplastic lymphoma kinase ( ALK ) fusion gene and may benefit from ALK inhibitor therapy. To detect ALK fusion genes, we developed a novel test using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the ALK kinase domain (KD). Since ALK expression is mostly silenced in the adult with the exception of neuronal tissue, the normal lung tissue, mesothelial lining, and inflammatory cells are devoid of ALK transcript, making ALK KD RT-PCR an ideal surrogate test for ALK fusion transcripts in lung or pleural effusion. The test was designed with a short PCR product (197 bp) to work for both malignant pleural effusion (MPE) and formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) NSCLC samples. Using ALK IHC as a reference, the sensitivity of the test was 100% for both MPE and FFPE. The specificity was 97.6% for MPE and 97.4% for FFPE. Two false positive cases were found. One was a metastatic brain lesion which should be avoided in the future due to intrinsic ALK expression in the neuronal tissue. The other one resulted from ALK gene amplification. Due to potential false positivity, subsequent confirmation tests such as fluorescence in situ hybridization or multiplex PCR would be preferable. Nevertheless, the test is simple and inexpensive with no false negativity, making it a desirable screening test. It also offers an advantage over multiplex RT-PCR with the capability to detect novel ALK fusions. Indeed through the screening test, we found a novel ALK fusion partner (sperm antigen with calponin homology and coiled-coil domains 1 like gene, SPECC1L ) with increased sensitivity to crizotinib in vitro . In summary, a novel RNA-based ALK KD analysis was developed for ALK rearrangement screening in MPE and FFPE specimens of NSCLC. This simple inexpensive test can be implemented as routine diagnostics."

https://openalex.org/W3200236633,"Disordered eating and eating disorders have huge impact on athletic health and performance. Understanding risk factors for disordered eating development is paramount to protecting the health and performance of these athletes. This project tested a model longitudinally to test whether body dissatisfaction (mediated by negative affect) and societal pressures (mediated by internalisation) predicted bulimic symptomatology at 1 year. The study recruited 1017 male and female athletes in a range of sports at three time points over a year. Cross-lag meditation modelling in MPLUS was utilised to test the hypothesised model. Results indicated that societal pressures mediated by general internalisation led to bulimic symptomatology and that gender and sport type do moderate the relationships. However, measurement issues indicate that scales not originally created for athletes may not reliably measure athletes' experience. This research highlights how understanding how to better assess risk factors and disordered eating related concepts in athletes is a key next step. The study is unique in its longitudinal design and in its sampling of a wide range of sports in both male and female athletes."
https://openalex.org/W3201381340,"Hunter harvest of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; hereafter ""sage-grouse"") has been regulated by wildlife agencies during most of the past century. Hunting season regulations were maintained with the intention of providing sustainable hunting opportunities. Sage-grouse populations oscillate over time, and population growth can be influenced by seasonal weather and habitat disturbance. From 1995-2013, we compared sage-grouse lek trends from 22 relatively distinct sage-grouse population segments in 9 western U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces. We stratified these populations into 3 broad categories (non-hunted [n = 8], continuously hunted [n = 10], and hunting season discontinued between 1996-2003 [n = 4]) with 8 different regulation histories to evaluate the potential impact of harvest on sage-grouse populations. Concomitantly, we assessed the effects of proportion burned, forested and cropland habitat; winter, spring, and summer precipitation; and human population, road, and oil and gas well densities on initial and time-varying lek counts. Density-dependent models fit lek trend data best for all regulation histories. In general, higher proportions of burnt, forested, and cropland habitat; and greater human population and oil and gas well densities were associated with lower equilibrium abundance (K). We found mixed results regarding the effect of hunting regulations on instantaneous growth rate (r). The cessation of harvest from 1996-2001 in approximately half of the largest sage-grouse population in our analysis was associated with higher r. Continuously harvested sage-grouse populations with permit hunting seasons had higher r during years with higher proportion of area exposed to permitted hunting rather than general upland game seasons. However, more liberal hunting regulations were positively associated with higher r in populations continuously harvested under general upland game hunts. Our results suggest that discontinuing harvest in the largest population resulted in greater population growth rates; however, this was not consistently the case for smaller populations. To no surprise, not all sage-grouse populations were influenced by the same environmental change or human disturbance factors. Our results will assist managers to understand factors associated with K, which provides the best targets for conservation efforts."

To diagnose this disease, we developed battery-powered remote sensing devices capable of long-range (LoRa) communication and installed them in pine trees ( Pinus densiflora) in Gyeongju and Ulsan, South Korea. Upon analyzing the collected tree sensing signals, which represented stem resistance, we found that the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of the sensing signals was useful for distinguishing between uninfected and infected trees. The MAD of infected trees was greater than that of uninfected trees from August of the year, and in the two-dimensional plane, consisting of the MAD value in July and that in October, the infected and uninfected trees were separated by the first-order boundary line generated using linear discriminant analysis. It was also observed that wood moisture content and precipitation affected MAD. This is the first study to diagnose pine wilt disease using remote sensors attached to trees."
https://openalex.org/W3199746216,"Gordon Research Conferences (GRC) are among the meetings that are particularly important as they are rather small and foster scientific exchange. Many established researchers participate and meet for a week, often in some remote location. The 2021 molecular membrane biology Gordon conference, usually held at Proctor Academy, was one of the many meetings affected when the SARS-CoV2 pandemic resulted in an immediate shutdown of all public life and world travel. Scientists and scientific organizations reacted immediately and discovered the advantages of online meetings. Several members of the membrane biology community felt that a complete halt of scientific conferences would particularly harm young investigators in their career path as they would not get the chance to present their data in front of the scientific community. As a result, we decided to take the initiative and try to find a format for an online meeting in 2021. Before starting, we sent around a survey to ask for interest and received overwhelming enthusiasm and support—a testament to the vitality of the membrane trafficking community. We agreed on a format that would mimic somehow the in-person meeting: poster sessions, followed by a dense set of talks with sufficient time for discussion, a meet-the-speaker slot, then another set of talks, and eventually another poster session or meeting time. Talks were presented mostly by early career researchers, postdocs, or assistant professors. To foster discussion and presentation of unpublished data, talks were live and not recorded. Gather.town was used as a platform for poster sessions and social interactions. Very importantly, the meeting was completely free as funding was secured via four journals (Journal of Cell Biology, Journal of Cell Science, FEBS Journal, and Traffic Journal) and three German DFG-funded research consortia (SFB 944, 958, and TR 186), which covered the user fees for all participants. How did it work? Maybe we start from the end. “This was the best online meeting I attended during the entire pandemic period” was one of the enthusiastic responses. Why? Because the social platform was as close as one can get to real-life social interactions, and the sessions worked almost perfectly for our needs. Two poster sessions with a total of some 50 posters flanked the talks on each day. Posters were accessible, presenters available, and it felt like being in a real meeting. Poster sessions were well attended and so busy that people had to wait, just like an in-person meeting. But since posters were available throughout the entire meeting, people were also able to view posters in their own spare time. The entire community was present, from PhD students to postdocs, young investigators, and established figures in the field. For the talks, we explicitly asked speakers to keep to their time to 10 min to allow for questions, asked the audience to write their questions into the chat and the chair to act as a mediator between questions and speaker. This made sessions dense, but also to the point. As all speakers kept to their time, and the chairs monitored their sessions so well, enough time was left for questions. We were impressed, how much science can be compressed in a short talk, and how excellent all speakers presented. The more exciting the talk, the earlier the questions appeared in the chat. As the chairs combined questions and condensed the information, the most important open issues were immediately addressed. Breaks were reserved to meet-the-speaker, and by the end of the day—or better the end of the meeting—many of us realized how long they had been sitting fixed in front of their screen without moving much. Throughout the meeting, 200–250 people were listening to the talks, more than 150 were present at the poster sessions. It was as good as it gets. We selected speakers based on their science and tried to balance the field and explicitly focused on postdocs and early career investigators. As the science of the talks was meant to be “off the record” and live, in the spirit of a Gordon Research Conference, we decided to just let the program speak for itself (see supporting information). Liz Miller (MRC Cambridge, United Kingdom) opened the dances of the first ER-focused session with a talk about the role of unstructured regions in assembly of the COPII coat (unpublished and (1Stancheva V.G.

Sessions 2 and 3, focused on trafficking through the Golgi compartments and secretory pathway, included talks by Ivan Castello Serrano (University of Virginia, USA) about the importance of lipid rafts for export of transmembrane proteins from the Golgi network, and Anup Parchure (Yale University, USA) whose work suggests that secretory granule biogenesis at the TGN is facilitated by LLPS.

David Murray (University of Dundee, United Kingdom) presented exciting unpublished data about the functional characterization of the exocyst tethering complex and its cross talk with phosphoinositide signaling. The session was closed by Allison Zajac (University of Chicago, USA), whose latest preprint (10Zajac A.L. Horne-Badovinac S.

The first day wrapped up with a session focused on mitochondria/peroxisomal membranes packed with excellent unpublished findings. Tim König (McGill University, Canada)'s work reveals the lipid and protein composition and the mechanisms of formation of mitochondrial-derived vesicles (MDVs). Joshua Pemberton (NICHD, USA) developed tools to alter the lipid composition of the outer mitochondrial membrane and showed that localized production of diacylglycerol altered mitochondrial morphology. Cansu Kuey (University of Warwick, United Kingdom) showed that acute redistribution of clathrin mediated endocytosis machinery on mitochondria is sufficient to drive the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles. Noa Dahan (Weizman Institute, Israel) talked about the importance of local mRNA translation for peroxisomal function. The second day kicked off with a session on the endocytic pathway, in which Andreas Mayer (University of Lausanne, Switzerland) discussed his unpublished data on the regulation of membrane fission in the endolysosomal system by CROP, a novel complex consisting of Atg18 and the retromer complex. Staying on the membrane fission theme, Sho Suzuki (Cornell University, USA) revealed how the yeast Mvp1/SNX8 protein and the dynamin-like GTPase Vps1 drive fission and endosomal recycling. While Doris Höglinger (Biochemistry Center Heidelberg, Germany) discussed routes for cholesterol and sphingolipid transport, Florian Fröhlich (University of Osnabrück, Germany) presented his proteomic mapping of the endolysosomal system, which is available as a preprint (11Eising S.

A yeast lysosomal biogenesis map uncovers the cargo spectrum of lysosomal protein targeting pathways.bioRxiv. 2021; ([preprint])https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.24.453616Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In the second session of the day, Kamalesh Kumari (Weizmann Institute, Israel) argued that mechanochemical sequestration and vesicle crumpling drive exocytosis while maintaining apical membrane homeostasis. On the theme of membrane compartmentalization, Kasey Day (University of Texas, USA) provided evidence that liquid-like protein droplets are important for endocytic vesicle formation, and Claudia Matthaeus (NIH, USA) discussed the role of lipid uptake in caveolae. Henning Arlt (Harvard University, USA) provided structural and mechanistic insights into lipid droplet biogenesis. Andrés Guillén-Samander (Yale University, USA) revealed how VPS13D together with Miro facilitates interorganelle contacts between ER and mitochondria and peroxisomes (12Guillén-Samander A. Leonzino M. Hanna M.G. Tang N. Shen H. Camilli P.D. VPS13D bridges the ER to mitochondria and peroxisomes via Miro.J. Cell Biol. 2021; 220e202010004Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). These presentations were followed by two talks on ESCRT-III: Jiwei Liu (Rosalind Franklin Institute, UK) provided compelling evidence for the presence of ESCRT-III membrane remodelers in bacteria, while Joachim Moser von Filseck (University of Geneva, Switzerland) provided molecular details on ESCRT-III membrane remodeling in eukaryotes (13Moser von Filseck J. Barberi L. Talledge N. Johnson I.E. Frost A. Lenz M. Roux A. Anisotropic ESCRT-III architecture governs helical membrane tube formation.Nat. Commun. 2020; 11: 1516Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The last three talks of the day were on autophagy. Tara Fisher (NIH, USA) started with a presentation on how STING induces LC3 lipidation (14Fischer T.D. Wang C. Padman B.S. Lazarou M. Youle R.J. STING induces LC3B lipidation onto single-membrane vesicles via the V-ATPase and ATG16L1-WD40 domain.J. Cell Biol. 2020; 219e202009128Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rachel Ulferts (Francs Crick Institute, United Kingdom) then discussed the role of the V-ATPase in inflammation and autophagy. Finally, Florian Wilfling (Max-Planck-Institute for Biophysics, Germany) shared his data on intrinsic autophagy receptors and how they function in the disposal of macromolecular machines including stalled endocytic machinery (15Wilfling F. Lee C.-W. Erdmann P.S. Zheng Y. Sherpa D. Jentsch S. Pfander B. Schulman B.A. Baumeister W. A selective autophagy pathway for phase-separated endocytic protein deposits.Mol. Cell. 2020; 80: 764-778.e7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Virtual molecular membrane biology 2021 was a success mainly because junior scientists were given a platform to present their exciting (and unpublished!) research. Given that many talks at previous meetings were presented by established scientists, who are also one reason to attract others (and some would otherwise also not join the meeting if not invited), the online meeting could make sure that more junior researchers were allowed to present and make their presence to the scientific community. In-person meetings mean frequent get-togethers on all occasions and time to talk and interact beyond listening to the talks. As scientists, we need this type of interaction to process what we learned and develop new ideas and directions. In an online format, travel, organization, and a week away from the lab and family are not happening, with all its pros and cons. Will such online meetings continue to work in the future? Or will we return to what we had before? We believe virtual gatherings cannot completely substitute for in-person meetings, but they can be a powerful way to keep the community connected outside of conference season. It definitely worked for us. This article contains supporting information. Download .pdf (.28 MB) Help with pdf files Supporting information"
