https://openalex.org/W2091811407,"Expression of the type II voltage-dependent sodium channel gene is restricted to neurons by a silencer element active in nonneuronal cells. We have cloned cDNA coding for a transcription factor (REST) that binds to this silencer element. Expression of a recombinant REST protein confers the ability to silence type II reporter genes in neuronal cell types lacking the native REST protein, whereas expression of a dominant negative form of REST in nonneuronal cells relieves silencing mediated by the native protein. REST transcripts in developing mouse embryos are detected ubiquitously outside of the nervous system. We propose that expression of the type II sodium channel gene in neurons reflects a default pathway that is blocked in nonneuronal cells by the presence of REST."

https://openalex.org/W1979221090,"The structure of a protein triple helix has been determined at 1.9 angstrom resolution by x-ray crystallographic studies of a collagen-like peptide containing a single substitution of the consensus sequence. This peptide adopts a triple-helical structure that confirms the basic features determined from fiber diffraction studies on collagen: supercoiling of polyproline II helices and interchain hydrogen bonding that follows the model II of Rich and Crick. In addition, the structure provides new information concerning the nature of this protein fold. Each triple helix is surrounded by a cylinder of hydration, with an extensive hydrogen bonding network between water molecules and peptide acceptor groups. Hydroxyproline residues have a critical role in this water network. The interaxial spacing of triple helices in the crystal is similar to that in collagen fibrils, and the water networks linking adjacent triple helices in the crystal structure are likely to be present in connective tissues. The breaking of the repeating (X-Y-Gly)n pattern by a Gly-->Ala substitution results in a subtle alteration of the conformation, with a local untwisting of the triple helix. At the substitution site, direct interchain hydrogen bonds are replaced with interstitial water bridges between the peptide groups. Similar conformational changes may occur in Gly-->X mutated collagens responsible for the diseases osteogenesis imperfecta, chondrodysplasias, and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome IV."
https://openalex.org/W1993876642,"Activation of the Raf and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) (or mitogen-activated protein kinases) are key events in mitogenic signalling, but little is known about interactions with other signaling pathways. Agents that raise levels of intracellular cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) blocked DNA synthesis and signal transduction in Rat1 cells exposed to epidermal growth factor (EGF) or lysophosphatidic acid. In the case of EGF, receptor tyrosine kinase activity and association with the signaling molecules Grb2 and Shc were unaffected by cAMP. Likewise, EGF-dependent accumulation of the guanosine 5'-triphosphate-bound form of Ras was unaffected. In contrast, activation of Raf-1 and ERK kinases was inhibited. Thus, cAMP appears to inhibit signal transmission from Ras by preventing Ras-dependent activation of Raf-1."
https://openalex.org/W2045876058,"Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases p42mapk and p44mapk are activated in cells stimulated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) and other agents. A principal pathway for MAP kinase (MAPK) activation by EGF consists of sequential activations of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Sos, the guanosine triphosphate binding protein Ras, and the protein kinases Raf-1, MAPK kinase (MKK), and MAPK. Because adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate (cAMP) does not activate MAPK and has some opposing physiologic effects, the effect of increasing intracellular concentrations of cAMP with forskolin and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine on the EGF-stimulated MAPK pathway was studied. Increased concentrations of cAMP blocked activation of Raf-1, MKK, and MAPK in Rat1hER fibroblasts, accompanied by a threefold increase in Raf-1 phosphorylation on serine 43 in the regulatory domain. Phosphorylation of Raf-1 in vitro and in vivo reduces the apparent affinity with which it binds to Ras and may contribute to the blockade by cAMP."

https://openalex.org/W1992082799,"Nucleotide excision repair is the principal way by which human cells remove UV damage from DNA. Human cell extracts were fractionated to locate active components, including xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and ERCC factors. The incision reaction was then reconstituted with the purified proteins RPA, XPA, TFIIH (containing XPB and XPD), XPC, UV-DDB, XPG, partially purified ERCC1/XPF complex, and a factor designated IF7. UV-DDB (related to XPE protein) stimulated repair but was not essential. ERCC1- and XPF-correcting activity copurified with an ERCC1-binding polypeptide of 110 kDa that was absent in XP-F cell extract. Complete repair synthesis was achieved by combining these factors with DNA polymerase epsilon, RFC, PCNA, and DNA ligase I. The reconstituted core reaction requires about 30 polypeptides."

https://openalex.org/W2131363383,"Complexes of five peptides (from HIV-1, influenza A virus, HTLV-1, and hepatitis B virus proteins) bound to the human class I MHC molecule HLA-A2 have been studied by X-ray crystallography. While the peptide termini and their second and C-terminal anchor side chains are bound similarly in all five cases, the main chain and side chain conformations of each peptide are strikingly different in the center of the binding site, and these differences are accessible to direct TCR recognition. Each of the central peptide residues is seen to point up for some bound peptides, but down or sideways for others. Thus, although fixed at its ends, the structure of an MHC-bound peptide appears to be a highly complex function of its entire sequence, potentially sensitive to even small sequence differences. In contrast, MHC structural variation is relatively limited. These results offer a structural framework for understanding the role of nonanchor peptide side chains in both peptide-MHC binding affinity and TCR recognition."

https://openalex.org/W2080314410,"Nonpancreatic secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) displays proinflammatory properties; however, its physiological substrate is not identified. Although inactive toward intact cells, sPLA2 hydrolyzed phospholipids in membrane microvesicles shed from Ca(2+)-loaded erythrocytes as well as from platelets and from whole blood cells challenged with inflammatory stimuli. sPLA2 was stimulated upon degradation of sphingomyelin (SPH) and produced lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), which induced platelet aggregation. Finally, lysophospholipid-containing vesicles and sPLA2 were detected in inflammatory fluids in relative proportions identical to those used in vitro. We conclude that upon loss of phospholipid asymmetry, cell-derived microvesicles provide a preferential substrate for sPLA2. SPH hydrolysis, which is provoked by various cytokines, regulates sPLA2 activity, and the novel lipid mediator LPA can be generated by this pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2014264924,"Mammalian high conductance, calcium-activated potassium (maxi-K) channels are composed of two dissimilar subunits, alpha and beta. We have examined the functional contribution of the beta subunit to the properties of maxi-K channels expressed heterologously in Xenopus oocytes. Channels from oocytes injected with cRNAs encoding both alpha and beta subunits were much more sensitive to activation by voltage and calcium than channels composed of the alpha subunit alone, while expression levels, single-channel conductance, and ionic selectivity appeared unaffected. Channels from oocytes expressing both subunits were sensitive to DHS-I, a potent agonist of native maxi-K channels, whereas channels composed of the alpha subunit alone were insensitive. Thus, alpha and beta subunits together contribute to the functional properties of expressed maxi-K channels. Regulation of co-assembly might contribute to the functional diversity noted among members of this family of potassium channels."

https://openalex.org/W1979749286,"Crystal structures of the DNA repair enzyme human uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG), combined with mutational analysis, reveal the structural basis for the specificity of the enzyme. Within the classic alpha/beta fold of UDG, sequence-conserved residues form a positively charged, active-site groove the width of duplex DNA, at the C-terminal edge of the central four-stranded parallel beta sheet. In the UDG-6-aminouracil complex, uracil binds at the base of the groove within a rigid preformed pocket that confers selectivity for uracil over other bases by shape complementary and by main chain and Asn-204 side chain hydrogen bonds. Main chain nitrogen atoms are positioned to stabilize the oxyanion intermediate generated by His-268 acting via nucleophilic attack or general base mechanisms. Specific binding of uracil flipped out from a DNA duplex provides a structural mechanism for damaged base recognition."
https://openalex.org/W2087393103,"Growth and patterning of the vertebrate limb are controlled by the ridge, posterior mesenchyme, and non-ridge ectoderm. Fibroblast growth factor 4 (FGF4) and Sonic hedgehog (SHH) can mediate signaling from the ridge and posterior mesenchyme, respectively. Here we show that dorsal ectoderm is required together with FGF4 to maintain Shh expression. Removal of dorsal ectoderm results in loss of posterior skeletal elements, which can be rescued by exogenous SHH. Wnt7a, which is expressed in dorsal ectoderm, provides the signal required for Shh expression and formation of posterior structures. These results provide evidence that all three axes (dorsoventral, proximodistal, and anteroposterior) are intimately linked by the respective signals WNT7a, FGF4, and SHH during limb out-growth and patterning."
https://openalex.org/W1979857580,"Replication of prions is dependent on the presence of the host protein PrPc. During the course of disease, PrPc is converted into an abnormal isoform, PrPSc, which accumulates in the brain. Attempts to identify the cell type(s) in which prion replication and PrP conversion occur have reached conflicting results. Although PrP mRNA is present in high amounts in neurons throughout the life of the animal, PrPSc initially accumulates in astrocytes and possibly other glial cells and, later in the course of the disease, spreads diffusely in the tissue, often in white matter. We report here that PrP mRNA is expressed not only in neurons but also in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes throughout the brain of postnatal hamsters and rats. The level of glial Prp mRNA expression in neonatal animals was comparable to that of neurons and increased two-fold during postnatal development. A substantial portion of brain PrP mRNA is therefore contributed by glial cells. Our results provide an explanation for the accumulation of PrPSc in white matter tissue and in the cytoplasm of glial cells and argue for a direct involvement of glia in prion propagation."

https://openalex.org/W2054426244,"The neurogenic gene Xotch acts to divert cellular determination during gastrulation in Xenopus embryos. We examined the role of Xotch in the developing retina, where cell signaling events are thought to affect differentiation. Xotch is expressed in undifferentiated precursor cells of the ciliary marginal zone and late embryonic central retina. It is not expressed in stem cells or in differentiated neurons and glia. Expression in the retina is spatially restricted even in the absence of cell division. The final Xotch-positive precursor cells in the central retina mostly differentiate as Müller glia, suggesting that this is the last available fate of cells in the frog retina. Transfection of an activated form of Xotch into isolated retinal cells causes them to retain a neuroepithelial morphology, indicating that the continued activation of Xotch inhibits cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1986325903,"Signaling by TGF beta-related factors requires ligand-induced association between type I and type II transmembrane serine/threonine kinases. In Drosophila, the saxophone (sax) and thick veins (tkv) genes encode type I receptors that mediate signaling by decapentaplegic (dpp), a member of the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) subgroup of TGF beta-type factors. In this report, we demonstrate that the Drosophila punt gene encodes atr-II, a previously described type II receptor that on its own is able to bind activin but not BMP2, a vertebrate ortholog of dpp. Mutations in punt produce phenotypes similar to those exhibited by tkv, sax, and dpp mutants. Furthermore, punt will bind BMP2 in concert with tkv or sax, forming complexes with these receptors. We suggest that punt functions as a type II receptors for dpp and propose that BMP signaling in vertebrates may also involve sharing of type II receptors by diverse ligands."
https://openalex.org/W2052779439,"Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is an immunoregulatory cytokine produced by activated T lymphocytes to promote the growth and differentiation of cells that participate in immune defense. This study demonstrates the rapid activation of a specific DNA binding factor by IL-4. The IL-4 nuclear-activated factor (IL-4 NAF) appeared within minutes of IL-4 stimulation and recognized a specific DNA sequence found in the promoters of IL-4-responsive genes. Activation of this putative transcription factor required tyrosine phosphorylation, and antibodies specific for phosphotyrosine recognize the IL-4 NAF-DNA complex. Thus, IL-4 appears to transduce a signal to the nucleus through tyrosine phosphorylation of a latent DNA binding factor."
https://openalex.org/W2076305899,"Cerebral deposition of amyloid beta protein (A beta) is an early and critical feature of Alzheimer's disease. Here we analyze the substrate requirements of proteases (""beta-secretases"") that cleave the beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta APP) at the N-terminus of A beta (Asp-597 of beta APP695) in intact human cells. The cleavage requires a membrane-bound substrate but tolerates shifts in the distance of the hydrolyzed bond from the membrane. The major protease has a minimum recognition region of Val-594 to Ala-598; most substitutions in this sequence strongly decrease or eliminate A beta production. Only the Swedish familial Alzheimer's disease mutation (K595N/M596L) strongly increases A beta production. Moreover, in this mutant but not in the wild type, the entire cytoplasmic tail with its reinternalization signals can be deleted without affecting A beta N-terminal cleavage, consistent with the concept that cleavage of this mutant occurs in a different cellular compartment than that of wild-type molecules. Our results have important implications for current intensive approaches to develop assays for and identify enzymes with beta-secretase activity."

https://openalex.org/W2002655945,"At room temperature (23°C–25°C), the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in area CA1 of slices from young male Sprague-Dawley rats was depressed by preincubation with the nitric oxide synthase inhibitors NG-nitro-l-arginine (l-NA, 100 μM) and NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME, 100 μM). The d isomers were ineffective under the same conditions. Hemoglobin (20 μM) reduced but did not completely block LTP. Neither l-NA (at concentrations up to 1 mM) nor hemoglobin (20 μM) had any significant effect on LTP in slices from adult rats at room temperature, or in young rats at 29°C–30°C. These results suggest that nitric oxide is unlikely to play a role in the induction of LTP under physiological conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2086995781,"5-Iodouracil-substituted RNA and DNA were crosslinked regiospecifically to associated proteins in yields of 70 to 94% of bound nucleic acid. Irradiation of the iodouracil chromophore with monochromatic, long-wavelength ultraviolet radiation (325 nanometers) eliminates excitation of other nucleic acid and protein chromophores. The combination of high crosslinking yields, excellent specificity, and elimination of photodamage to other chromophores represents an important advance toward the precise identification of contacts in nucleoprotein complexes."
https://openalex.org/W2055570976,"The mammalian rod synapse transmits a binary signal (one photon or none) using tonic, rapid exocytosis. We constructed a quantitative, physical model of the synapse. Presynaptically, a single, linear active zone provides docking sites for approximately 130 vesicles, and a ""ribbon"" anchored to the active zone provides a depot for approximately 640 vesicles. Postsynaptically, 4 processes invaginate the terminal: 2 (known to have low affinity glutamate receptors) lie near the active zone (16 nm), and 2 (known to have high affinity glutamate receptors) lie at a distance (130-640 nm). The presynaptic structure seems designed to minimize fluctuations in tonic rate owing to empty docking sites, whereas the postsynaptic geometry may permit 1 vesicle to evoke an all-or-none response at all 4 postsynaptic processes."
https://openalex.org/W1980157636,"The continuous presence of nerve growth factor (NGF) is thought to be required for the elaboration of neuronal-like traits in PC12 cells. Surprisingly, we find that a 1 min exposure to NGF is sufficient to engage a longer-term genetic program leading to the acquisition of membrane excitability. Whereas continuous exposure to NGF causes the induction of a family of sodium channels, the effect of a brief exposure is to induce selectively expression of the peripheral nerve-type sodium channel gene PN1, through a distinct signaling pathway requiring immediate-early genes. A 1 min exposure of PC12 cells to interferon-gamma also causes PN1 gene induction, suggesting that the ""triggered"" NGF and interferon-gamma signaling pathways share common molecular intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W1972992370,"Cerebral deposition of beta-amyloid protein is a pathological feature central to Alzheimer's disease. Production of beta-amyloid by proteolytic processing of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (beta APP) is a critical initial step in beta-amyloidogenesis. We use an inhibitor of beta APP processing to block beta-amyloid peptide formation. Application of the inhibitor to cultured cells results in an accumulation of proteolytic intermediates of beta APP, enabling a precursor-product relationship between beta APP carboxy-terminal fragments and beta-amyloid peptides to be demonstrated directly. In the presence of inhibitor, these amyloidogenic carboxy-terminal fragments can be degraded to nonamyloidogenic products. The catabolism of beta APP carboxy-terminal intermediates and the formation of beta-amyloid peptides are likely to involve an early endosomal compartment as the subcellular site of processing."
https://openalex.org/W2083717815,"Motor axons preferentially reinnervate original synaptic sites on denervated muscle fibers. We have shown that components of synaptic basal lamina direct this selectivity, and we identified a protein, s-laminin, that is concentrated in synaptic basal lamina. Here, we report that a recombinant s-laminin fragment inhibits neurite outgrowth promoted by laminin. A tripeptide sequence in this fragment, Leu-Arg-Glu (LRE), contributes to this inhibition and is itself sufficient to inhibit outgrowth. LRE-mediated inhibition is selective for motoneuron-like cells and is observed in mixtures with several, but not all, outgrowth-promoting substrates. Growth cones extending on laminin stop for up to several hours upon contacting deposits of the s-laminin fragment. Thus, LRE may serve as a cell type-selective and context-dependent target-derived signal that plays a role in synapse formation."
https://openalex.org/W1988101926,"The initial steps of pattern formation in the developing Drosophila eye involve the coordination of cell cycles, changes in cell shape, and the specification of the R8 photoreceptor cell. These events begin several cell rows ahead of the morphogenetic furrow and are positively regulated by secreted signaling proteins and the proneural HLH transcription factor atonal (ato). Two HLH regulatory proteins that function to suppress neuronal development in other tissues, extra macrochaetae (emc) and hairy (h), are expressed ahead of the morphogenetic furrow. While neither h nor emc is required for photoreceptor cell determination, in emc-h-clones the morphogenetic furrow and differentiated eye field advance up to eight ommatidial rows ahead of adjacent wild-type tissue. This indicates that morphogenetic furrow progression and neuronal differentiation are negatively regulated by a combination of anteriorly expressed HLH regulatory proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2055564626,"Dominant mutations of the Drosophila ninaE-encoded rhodopsin are described that reduce the expression of wild-type rhodopsin and cause a slow, age-dependent form of retinal degeneration. A posttranslational event subsequent to the requirement for the ninaA-encoded cyclophilin is disrupted by the dominant mutations. Most of these dominant mutations are missense mutations that affect the physical properties of one of the seven transmembrane domains; another affects the cysteine involved in a disulfide linkage. The results indicate that misfolded or unstable mutant rhodopsin can interfere with maturation of wild-type rhodopsin, and that these cellular conditions may trigger retinal degeneration. In addition, these dominant rhodopsin mutations suppress the rapid degeneration seen in rdgC and norpA flies, indicating that high levels of rhodopsin are required."
https://openalex.org/W2032198766,"The alpha-Ca2+/calmodulin kinase II (alpha CaMKII) is required for long-term potentiation in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Here, we report that this kinase also has a crucial role in presynaptic plasticity. Paired-pulse facilitation is blunted in the CA1 region of mice heterozygous for a targeted mutation of alpha CaMKII, confirming that this kinase can promote neurotransmitter release. Unexpectedly, field and whole-cell recordings of posttetanic potentiation show that the synaptic responses of mutants are larger than those of controls, indicating that alpha CaMKII can also inhibit transmitter release immediately after tetanic stimulation. Thus, alpha CaMKII has the capacity either to potentiate or to depress excitatory synaptic transmission depending on the pattern of presynaptic activation."

https://openalex.org/W2026918968,"The role of glia in suppressing neuronal cell death was investigated in the visual system of the Drosophila mutant, reversed polarity (repo). The repo locus encodes a glial-specific homeodomain protein expressed in the optic lobes. Here, we show that survival of the laminar neurons in the optic lobe depends on repo expression in the laminar glia, indicating that the laminar glia supply factors required for neuronal survival. The repo glia also underwent cell death, suggesting that the laminar neurons are required for survival of the glia or that repo expression is required to suppress an intrinsic cell suicide program. Subsequent to the laminar cell death, the retinal cells in the repo visual system also degenerated, indicating that the retinal cell death was due to retrograde degeneration."

https://openalex.org/W2078856564,"Through specific intersubunit contacts, the four subunits of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor assemble into an alpha 2 beta gamma delta pentamer. The specificity of subunit association leads to formation of proper ligand binding sites and to transport of assembled pentamers to the cell surface. To identify determinants of subunit association, we constructed chimeric subunits, transfected them into HEK 293 cells, and studied their association with wild-type subunits. We used beta gamma chimeras to determine sequences that associate with the alpha subunit to form a ligand binding site and found residues 21-131 of the gamma subunit sufficient to form the site. Residues 51-131 of the beta subunit do not form a binding site, but do promote surface expression of pentamers; of these residues, R117 is key for surface expression. We studied formation of tetramers by alpha and gamma subunits and dimers by alpha and delta subunits, and used gamma delta chimeras to identify sequences that result in either dimers or tetramers. The conserved residues I145 and T150 of the gamma subunit promote alpha gamma alpha gamma tetramer formation, whereas the corresponding residues in the delta subunit, K145 and K150, allow only alpha delta dimer formation."
https://openalex.org/W2161155963,"Neuropeptide-mediated transmission was analyzed at Drosophila larval body-wall neuromuscular junctions. Focal application of vertebrate pituitary adenylyl cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP38) to the neuromuscular junction region triggered two temporally distinct muscle responses: an immediate depolarization followed by a large enhancement of K+ current. This late enhancement occurred many minutes after the early depolarization. High frequency stimulation of motor nerve fibers evoked a postsynaptic response mimicking that induced by PACAP38. This evoked response was desensitized by preincubation of the preparation with PACAP38. PACAP38-like immunoreactivity was also found in the Drosophila CNS and at almost all larval neuromuscular junctions. Moreover, an immunoreactive band that compares well with PACAP38 in size was identified in Western blot. These results demonstrate that a PACAP-like peptide may function in invertebrates and that a neuropeptide can evoke two distinct postsynaptic responses, each separated by up to 15 min. In addition, this initial electrophysiological study provides a basis for genetic analysis of neuropeptide function in Drosophila."
https://openalex.org/W2060211359,"ANCIENT fluvial networks on the surface of Mars suggest that it was warm and wet over three billion years ago. Surface features resembling massive outflow channels provide evidence that, even more recently, the martian crust contained the equivalent of a planet-wide reservoir of water several hundred metres deep1,2. But arguments based on the isotopic fractionation3,4 and present-day escape rate of hydrogen in the martian atmosphere require only 0.5 metres of crustal water today and about six metres in the past5. An additional constraint on the evolution of the isotopic composition of martian water has recently been obtained6 from measurements of the deuterium to hydrogen ratio of hydrous minerals in the SNC meteorites—meteorites that almost certainly originated on Mars. Here I show that these new data require that the modern crustal reservoirs of martian water must be quite large, at least several metres in global-equivalent depth. The deuterium enrichment of the present martian atmosphere then implies that the reservoir of crustal water on ancient Mars was several hundred metres deep, consistent with the geological evidence3,4."
https://openalex.org/W2090243864,"Experiments in which several high and/or low frequency stimulation patterns were applied to different groups of afferents in CA1 hippocampal slices revealed the existence of heterosynaptic interactions between LTP and LTD. Specifically, we report that repeated induction of LTD on one input was associated with a heterosynaptic reversal of the LTP previously induced on a separate pathway. Reapplication of high frequency stimulation at the end of the experiment reinstated LTP. This heterosynaptic reversal occurred without modification of naive responses, and it was prevented by D-AP5, an NMDA receptor antagonist, or cyclosporin A, a calcineurin inhibitor. Similarly, induction of LTP on one input was found to reverse heterosynaptically the LTD previously induced on a separate pathway. This effect was also sensitive to D-AP5, it occurred without modification of naive pathways, and LTD could be reinstated by low frequency trains. These results indicate that repeated induction of LTP or LTD on one group of afferents can reset synaptic efficacy at other nonactivated synapses."
https://openalex.org/W1997505073,"The targeting of sensory afferent neurons in the leech CNS occurs in two discrete steps that are mediated via different carbohydrate recognitions, as shown by molecular perturbations of cultured embryos. A constitutive carbohydrate marker that is generic to all of these neurons mediates their initial defasciculation and arborization across the entire target region via mannose-specific recognition. Subsequently, two subsets of these same neurons can be differentiated by their expression of other markers that are located on hybrid or complex type carbohydrate chains. These developmentally regulated carbohydrate markers then mediate the target assembly of their respective neuronal subsets into discrete subregions. Thus, by performing opposing functions in a temporal sequence, constitutive and developmentally regulated carbohydrate markers collaborate in the targeting of neuronal subsets in the CNS."
https://openalex.org/W2094542343,"Alternative splicing of the Shaker (Sh) locus of Drosophila generates several transcripts with divergent 5' and 3' domains that produce kinetically distinct K+ currents in Xenopus oocytes. Although suggestive that alternative splicing may be involved in generating K+ channel diversity, clear tissue-specific differences in the distribution of particular Sh gene products have not been demonstrated. Using lacZ as a reporter gene for accurate splicing of variable Sh3' domains, we observe differences in beta-galactosidase expression patterns in transgenic animals that indicate both temporal and spatial regulation of 3' splice choice. The differences in 3'splice choice can account for variation in recovery kinetics of Sh-encoded K+ currents recorded in adult flies. The results indicate that tissue-specific expression of functionally distinct Sh K+ channels is regulated, in part, at the level of pre-mRNA splicing and implicate sequences in or around the 3' splice sites in regulating the choice of 3' domain."
