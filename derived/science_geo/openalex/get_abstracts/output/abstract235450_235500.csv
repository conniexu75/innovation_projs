https://openalex.org/W2044782567,"PGC-1α is a coactivator of nuclear receptors and other transcription factors that regulates several metabolic processes, including mitochondrial biogenesis and respiration, hepatic gluconeogenesis, and muscle fiber-type switching. We show here that, while hepatocytes lacking PGC-1α are defective in the program of hormone-stimulated gluconeogenesis, the mice have constitutively activated gluconeogenic gene expression that is completely insensitive to normal feeding controls. C/EBPβ is elevated in the livers of these mice and activates the gluconeogenic genes in a PGC-1α-independent manner. Despite having reduced mitochondrial function, PGC-1α null mice are paradoxically lean and resistant to diet-induced obesity. This is largely due to a profound hyperactivity displayed by the null animals and is associated with lesions in the striatal region of the brain that controls movement. These data illustrate a central role for PGC-1α in the control of energy metabolism but also reveal novel systemic compensatory mechanisms and pathogenic effects of impaired energy homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2019092505,"A small organizing center, the quiescent center (QC), maintains stem cells in the Arabidopsis root and defines the stem cell niche. The phytohormone auxin influences the position of this niche by an unknown mechanism. Here, we identify the PLETHORA1 (PLT1) and PLT2 genes encoding AP2 class putative transcription factors, which are essential for QC specification and stem cell activity. The PLT genes are transcribed in response to auxin accumulation and are dependent on auxin response transcription factors. Distal PLT transcript accumulation creates an overlap with the radial expression domains of SHORT-ROOT and SCARECROW, providing positional information for the stem cell niche. Furthermore, the PLT genes are activated in the basal embryo region that gives rise to hypocotyl, root, and root stem cells and, when ectopically expressed, transform apical regions to these identities. Thus, the PLT genes are key effectors for establishment of the stem cell niche during embryonic pattern formation."
https://openalex.org/W1979270142,"Elevations in circulating glucose and gut hormones during feeding promote pancreatic islet cell viability in part via the calcium- and cAMP-dependent activation of the transcription factor CREB. Here, we describe a signaling module that mediates the synergistic effects of these pathways on cellular gene expression by stimulating the dephosphorylation and nuclear entry of TORC2, a CREB coactivator. This module consists of the calcium-regulated phosphatase calcineurin and the Ser/Thr kinase SIK2, both of which associate with TORC2. Under resting conditions, TORC2 is sequestered in the cytoplasm via a phosphorylation-dependent interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. Triggering of the calcium and cAMP second messenger pathways by glucose and gut hormones disrupts TORC2:14-3-3 complexes via complementary effects on TORC2 dephosphorylation; calcium influx increases calcineurin activity, whereas cAMP inhibits SIK2 kinase activity. Our results illustrate how a phosphatase/kinase module connects two signaling pathways in response to nutrient and hormonal cues."
https://openalex.org/W2015222495,"The Ryk receptor belongs to the atypical receptor tyrosine kinase family. It is a new member of the family of Wnt receptor proteins. However, the molecular mechanisms by which the Ryk receptor functions remain unknown. Here, we report that mammalian Ryk, unlike the Drosophila Ryk homolog Derailed, functions as a coreceptor along with Frizzled for Wnt ligands. Ryk also binds to Dishevelled, through which it activates the canonical Wnt pathway, providing a link between Wnt and Dishevelled. Transgenic mice expressing Ryk siRNA exhibit defects in axon guidance, and Ryk is required for neurite outgrowth induced by Wnt-3a and in the activation of T cell factor (TCF) induced by Wnt-1. Thus, Ryk appears to play a crucial role in Wnt-mediated signaling."

https://openalex.org/W1989396934,"The large tumor antigen (LTag) of simian virus 40, an AAA+ protein, is a hexameric helicase essential for viral DNA replication in eukaryotic cells. LTag functions as an efficient molecular machine powered by ATP binding and hydrolysis for origin DNA melting and replication fork unwinding. To understand how ATP binding and hydrolysis are coupled to conformational changes, we have determined high-resolution structures (∼1.9 Å) of LTag hexamers in distinct nucleotide binding states. The structural differences of LTag in various nucleotide states detail the molecular mechanisms of conformational changes triggered by ATP binding/hydrolysis and reveal a potential mechanism of concerted nucleotide binding and hydrolysis. During these conformational changes, the angles and orientations between domains of a monomer alter, creating an “iris”-like motion in the hexamer. Additionally, six unique β hairpins on the channel surface move longitudinally along the central channel, possibly serving as a motor for pulling DNA into the LTag double hexamer for unwinding."
https://openalex.org/W2063304153,"The transcriptional repressor BCL-6 regulates B lymphocyte cell fate during the germinal center reaction by preventing terminal differentiation of B lymphocytes into plasma cells until appropriate signals are received. Here, we report a cofactor, MTA3, a cell type-specific subunit of the corepressor complex Mi-2/NuRD, for BCL-6-dependent cell fate determination. MTA3 is expressed in the same pattern in germinal centers as BCL-6. BCL-6 physically interacts with Mi-2/NuRD and this interaction is sensitive to BCL-6 acetylation status. Depletion of MTA3 by RNAi impairs BCL-6-dependent repression and alters the cell-specific transcriptional pattern characteristic of the B lymphocyte. Remarkably, exogenous expression of BCL-6 in a plasma cell line leads, in an MTA3-dependent manner, to repression of plasma cell-specific transcripts, reactivation of the B cell transcriptional program, expression of B lymphocyte cell surface markers, and reprogramming of cell fate."
https://openalex.org/W1992978140,"Oxidative stress is implicated in lung inflammation due to its effect on proinflammatory gene transcription. Changes in gene transcription depend on chromatin remodeling and the relative activities of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Alterations in the nuclear histone acetylation:deacetylation balance may result in uncontrolled transcription of specific proinflammatory genes. We studied the effect of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and cigarette smoke condensate (CSC) on histone acetylation:deacetylation in human alveolar epithelial cells (A549). H2O2 and CSC significantly increased acetylation of histone H4 proteins and were associated with decreased HDAC activity and HDAC2 levels in A549 cells. Also, the decreased HDAC2 activity was due to protein modification by aldehydes and nitric oxide products. Pretreatment of A549 cells with N-acetyl-l-cysteine attenuated the oxidant-mediated reduction in HDAC activity. Treatment of A549 cells with CSC did not cause nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation or expression and release of either interleukin (IL)-8 or IL-6. However, H2O2, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and IL-1beta significantly increased NF-kappaB activation and expression of IL-8 compared with control cells. Interestingly, CSC dose dependently inhibited TNF-alpha- and IL-1beta-mediated NF-kappaB activation and IL-8 expression. Thus, H2O2 and CSC enhance acetylation of histone proteins and decrease histone deacetylase activity but differentially regulate proinflammatory cytokine release in alveolar epithelial cells."
https://openalex.org/W2103224021,"CaBP1-8 are neuronal Ca(2+)-binding proteins with similarity to calmodulin (CaM). Here we show that CaBP4 is specifically expressed in photoreceptors, where it is localized to synaptic terminals. The outer plexiform layer, which contains the photoreceptor synapses with secondary neurons, was thinner in the Cabp4(-/-) mice than in control mice. Cabp4(-/-) retinas also had ectopic synapses originating from rod bipolar and horizontal cells tha HJt extended into the outer nuclear layer. Responses of Cabp4(-/-) rod bipolars were reduced in sensitivity about 100-fold. Electroretinograms (ERGs) indicated a reduction in cone and rod synaptic function. The phenotype of Cabp4(-/-) mice shares similarities with that of incomplete congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB2) patients. CaBP4 directly associated with the C-terminal domain of the Ca(v)1.4 alpha(1)-subunit and shifted the activation of Ca(v)1.4 to hyperpolarized voltages in transfected cells. These observations indicate that CaBP4 is important for normal synaptic function, probably through regulation of Ca(2+) influx and neurotransmitter release in photoreceptor synaptic terminals."
https://openalex.org/W2132814291,"Mitochondria are central in the regulation of cell death. Apart from providing the cell with ATP, mitochondria also harbor several death factors that are released upon apoptotic stimuli. Alterations in mitochondrial functions, increased oxidative stress, and neurons dying by apoptosis have been detected in Alzheimer's disease patients. These findings suggest that mitochondria may trigger the abnormal onset of neuronal cell death in Alzheimer's disease. We previously reported that presenilin 1 (PS1), which is often mutated in familial forms of Alzheimer's disease, is located in mitochondria and hypothesized that presenilin mutations may sensitize cells to apoptotic stimuli at the mitochondrial level. Presenilin forms an active γ-secretase complex together with Nicastrin (NCT), APH-1, and PEN-2, which among other substrates cleaves the β-amyloid precursor protein (β-APP) generating the amyloid β-peptide and the β-APP intracellular domain. Here we have identified dual targeting sequences (for endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria) in NCT and showed expression of NCT in mitochondria by immunoelectron microscopy. We also showed that NCT together with APH-1, PEN-2, and PS1 form a high molecular weight complex located in mitochondria. γ-Secretase activity in isolated mitochondria was demonstrated using C83 (α-secretase-cleaved C-terminal 83-residue β-APP fragment from BD8 cells lacking presenilin and thus γ-secretase activity) or recombinant C100-Flag (C-terminal 100-residue β-APP fragment) as substrates. Both systems generated an APP intracellular domain, and the activity was inhibited by the γ-secretase inhibitors l-685,458 or Compound E. This novel localization of NCT, PS1, APH-1, and PEN-2 expands the role and importance of γ-secretase activity to mitochondria. Mitochondria are central in the regulation of cell death.

The importance of PS for γ-secretase activity has been demonstrated in several ways (i) in PS-deficient cells (8Herreman A. Serneels L. Annaert W. Collen D. Schoonjans L. De Strooper B. Nat.

De Los Angeles J. Miller D.D. Xia W. Selkoe D.J. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11223-11230Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). All these studies showed inhibited γ-secretase activity and lower production of Aβ. The γ-secretase complex cleaves β-APP, Notch, and other type I transmembrane proteins such as the receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB4 (2Suh Y.H. Checler F. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 469-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The components of the γ-secretase complex are transported from the ER, through the Golgi compartment, to the cell surface where many of the substrates are located and processed. It appears that NCT matures on its way through the ER/Golgi and is fully glycosylated in the γ-secretase complex (13Kimberly W.T. LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35113-35117Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The glycosylation and trafficking of NCT through the Golgi apparatus is PS-dependent (14Herreman A.

Hasegawa H. Duthie M. Schmidt S.D. Ramabhadran T.V. Nixon R.A. Mathews P.M. Gandy S.E. Mount H.T. St. George-Hyslop P. Fraser P.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 28135-28142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The absence of PS1 leads to dramatic reductions in the level of mature glycosylated NCT and the redistribution of NCT away from the cell surface. In comparison, the absence of PS2 gives only modest reductions in the levels of immature NCT (17Chen F. Tandon A. Sanjo N. Gu Y.J. Hasegawa H. Arawaka S. Lee F.J. Ruan X. Mastrangelo P. Erdebil S.

However, γ-secretase activity does not require mature NCT, because the inhibition of oligosaccharide processing with mannosidase I inhibitors does not inhibit the γ-secretase cleavage of β-APP and Notch (14Herreman A. Van Gassen G. Bentahir M. Nyabi O. Craessaerts K. Mueller U. Annaert W. De Strooper B. J. Cell Sci. 2003; 116: 1127-1136Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Although the substrates for γ-secretase are mainly located in the plasma membrane it is possible that γ-secretase activity and cleavage of transmembrane proteins also occurs in other cellular compartments. Indeed, Siman and Velji (18Siman R. Velji J. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 1143-1153Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) demonstrated the localization of PS·NCT complexes and γ-secretase activity to the trans-Golgi network. In addition, PS1 and β-APP are located in lysosomes, and γ-secretase activity has been detected in this organelle (19Bagshaw R.D. Pasternak S.H. Mahuran D.J. Callahan J.W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 300: 615-618Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 20Pasternak S.H. Bagshaw R.D. Guiral M. Zhang S. Ackerley C.A. Pak B.J. Callahan J.W. Mahuran D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 26687-26694Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that PS1 is located in rat brain and liver mitochondria (21Ankarcrona M. Hultenby K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). That study was undertaken on the basis that PS mutations are known to sensitize cells to apoptotic stimuli in vitro (2Suh Y.H. Checler F. Pharmacol. Rev. 2002; 54: 469-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) and that mitochondria are central in the regulation of apoptosis (22Newmeyer D.D. Ferguson-Miller S. Cell. 2003; 112: 481-490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar, 23Kroemer G. Dallaporta B. Resche-Rigon M. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 619-642Crossref PubMed Scopus (1754) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that PS located in mitochondrial membranes could have a role in, for example, the opening of megapores during permeability transition or cytochrome c release and that PS1 mutations could facilitate such processes making cells more vulnerable at the mitochondrial level. It is also possible that PS1 is part of a γ-secretase-like complex in mitochondria and that such activity could cleave and activate proteins involved in the initiation of apoptosis. How PS1 is imported into mitochondria is presently unclear, because it lacks a mitochondrial targeting sequence at the N terminus (as predicted by iPSORT). It is therefore possible that PS1 is co-transported into mitochondria together with other proteins. Because it is known that PS1 is part of the γ-secretase complex (3Kimberly W.T. LaVoie M.J. Ostaszewski B.L. Ye W. Wolfe M.S. Selkoe D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6382-6387Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar), we did similar iPSORT searches for mitochondrial targeting sequences in NCT, APH-1, and PEN-2. Interestingly, NCT appears to have dual signaling peptides: one for ER and one for mitochondria. In the present study we therefore investigated the expression and activity of the γ-secretase complex in isolated rat mitochondria. Antibodies—The following antibodies were used for detection of components of the γ-secretase complex: NCT raised against C-terminal residues 693-709 of human NCT (N1660, Sigma), PS1 raised against residues 2-12 of human PS1 (Prof. John Hardy, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL), Ab14 directed against the N-terminal fragment of PS1 (Dr. Sam Gandy, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA), PS1 C-terminal raised against residues 263-378 of human PS1 (MAB5232, Chemicon, Temecula, CA), UD1 raised against the N-terminal residues ERVSNEEKLNL of PEN-2 (Dr. Jan Näslund, Karolinska Institutet, Sweden), and H2D-2 raised against human APH-1aL (Dr. Gang Yu, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Houston, TX). The antibody for detection of β-APP C1/6.1, directed against the C-terminal of β-APP was from Dr. Paul M. Mathews, Nathan Kline Institute. The following antibodies were used as markers for different subcellular compartments: mitochondria, Hsp60 (SPA-806, StressGen Biotechnologies Corp., Victoria, Canada); ER, KDEL (SPA-827, Nordic BioSite, Täby, Sweden); cis-Golgi, GM130 (610822, BD Biosciences); early endosome, Syntaxin-13 (VAM-SV026, StressGen Biotechnologies Corp., Victoria, Canada); plasma membrane, N-cadherin (610920, BD Biosciences). Subcellular Fractionation of Rat Brain—Male Sprague-Dawley rats (∼200 g) were purchased from B&K Universal (Sollentuna, Sweden). Approval for these experiments was received from the Animal Ethics Committee of South Stockholm, Sweden. Rats were killed in a carbon dioxide atmosphere and decapitated. The brain was dissected and homogenized in buffer A (250 mm mannitol, 0.5 mm EGTA, 5 mm Hepes, 0.1% BSA, pH 7.4) by several strokes at 1500 rpm with a high torque motor-driven pestle. All centrifugations were carried out at 4 °C. Unbroken cells and cell nuclei were removed by two centrifugations at 600 × g for 10 min. A crude mitochondrial pellet was obtained by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min. The pellet was resuspended and spun down again at 10,000 × g for 30 min. A membrane fraction was collected after centrifuging the supernatant at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The crude mitochondrial pellet was resuspended in 6 ml of 12% Percoll in buffer A, 3 ml was loaded onto a discontinuous Percoll gradient (1:1:1/2 40, 26, and 12% Percoll) and centrifuged at 31,000 × g in a swingout rotor for 45 min. The resulting two lower bands between the interface of the 40 and 26% Percoll layers were collected using a syringe and later identified as pure mitochondria by immunoblot analysis (see below). Mitochondria were washed in buffer A to remove the Percoll and then used for the different experiments described below. Brain Sections—A male Sprague-Dawley rat (200 g) was anesthetized with an overdose of chloral hydrate (5%). A needle was inserted into the left ventricle, and a cut was made in the right atrium. The rat was first perfused with 50 ml of PBS and then with 500 ml of fixation solution (2% formaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde in PBS, pH 7.3). The brain was dissected out of the body and left in a fixation solution for 2 h. Pieces of the cerebral cortex were put in PBS and azide and stored at 4 °C. Samples were subsequently prepared for immunoelectron microscopy as described below. Immunoelectron Microscopy—Isolated rat brain mitochondrial pellets and rat brain tissue were fixed for 1-2 h in 2% formaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in PBS, pH 7.3. After repeated rinsing in PBS, the specimens were dehydrated in ethanol (70, 95, 100%), and embedded in LR White (London Resin Company). They were first incubated in a mixture of equal parts ethanol and LR White (v/v) for 30 min and then in pure resin for 12-15 h at 4 °C. After two additional incubations in LR White (30 min each), they were put into gelatin capsules filled with resin and placed in an UV light polymerization unit (Agar Scientific) for 12 h. Thin sections were cut with diamond knives on a Leica Ultracut and picked up on nickel grids coated with formvar film. For immunogold staining, the grids were placed on droplets of PBS, 2% BSA for 30 min to block unspecific binding sites, transferred to primary antibodies diluted in PBS, 2% BSA, and incubated for 2 h in a humid box. After rinsing with PBS, 2% BSA, they were placed on droplets of gold-labeled secondary antibodies diluted in PBS, 0.5% BSA (goat anti-rabbit IgG, Sigma) for 1 h. The sections were then rinsed with PBS, 0.5% BSA followed by PBS, postfixed with 2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 5 min, rinsed with PBS followed by water, and air-dried. Controls without primary antibodies or with unrelated antibodies were negative. Preabsorbtion of the Nicastrin antibody with the peptide used for immunization (KADVLFIAPREPGAVSY) as well as an unrelated peptide (TELPAPLSYFQN) in a 1:1 molar relationship was done as a control for binding specificity. Contrast staining was made with aqueous uranyl acetate for 5 min and lead citrate for 5 s. The specimens were examined in a Philips CM120 electron microscope at 80 kV and photographed using a Kodak MegaPlus CCD camera. Immunoblotting—Mitochondrial pellets were lysed in lysis buffer (Tris-buffered saline, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 2 mm EDTA, 2× protease inhibitor mixture complete EDTA-free (Roche Diagnostics), 2% Triton X-100 and 2% IGEPAL CA-630), and the protein concentration was determined using BCA reagents (Pierce). Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis through 12% self-cast SDS-polyacrylamide gels or 4-20% precast criterion SDS-PAGE (Bio-Rad) and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were blocked in 5% nonfat milk before overnight incubations with antibody. The membranes were subsequently incubated with secondary antibody (horseradish peroxidase-linked antibody, Amersham Biosciences) and developed using the Pierce Super Signal West Pico chemiluminescence substrate kit. Co-immunoprecipitation—Percoll-purified rat brain mitochondria were prepared as above and solubilized in 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1% CHAPSO with protease inhibitor mixture for 30 min on ice. Unsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 × g for 5 min, and the supernatant was preincubated with protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) under rotation for 1 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with the PS1 antibody Ab14, anti-NCT antibody, or pre-immune rabbit serum, overnight at 4 °C. Protein A-Sepharose was added and incubated for an additional 2 h. The precipitates were washed twice with solubilization buffer with 0.2% CHAPSO and once without CHAPSO, resuspended in the sample buffer, heated at 60 °C for 5 min, and loaded on a SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose filter and analyzed with an antibody against the C-terminal fragment of PS1. Blue Native (BN)-PAGE—BN-PAGE was performed as described (24Brookes P.S. Pinner A. Ramachandran A. Coward L. Barnes S. Kim H. Darley-Usmar V.M. Proteomics. 2002; 2: 969-977Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial pellets were resuspended in extraction buffer (0.75 m aminocaproic acid and 50 mm BisTris, pH 7.0, 20 μl/100 μg of protein), and n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside was added to give a final concentration of 1% w/v. The mixture was incubated for 20 min on ice. The samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min, and Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 (Serva, Heidelberg) in 0.75 m aminocaproic acid was added to the supernatant to give a final concentration of 0.3% w/v. The samples were separated for 17 h at 75 V on a 4-12% BisTris gel (Invitrogen) using 50 mm BisTris as an anode buffer and 15 mm BisTris, 50 mm Tricine containing 0.02% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250 as a cathode buffer. Molecular weight standards (high molecular weight calibration kit, Amersham Biosciences) were resuspended in extraction buffer (200 μl/250-μg vial) plus 25 μl of 10% n-dodecyl-β-d-maltoside and 12 μl of 5% Coomassie Blue. Before blotting, the gel was soaked in transfer buffer for 30 min (0.02 m Tris-HCl, 0.12 m glycine, 20% methanol, 0.05% w/v SDS), where after the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes at 140 mA for 2 h and probed with specific antibodies. γ-Secretase Activity Assays—The purified mitochondria and membrane pellet from the rat brain were solubilized in a solubilization buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.0, 150 mm KCl, 2 mm EGTA, 1% CHAPSO, and 2× protease inhibitor mixture) and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. BD8 cells are blastocyst cells derived from a PS1/PS2 knockout mouse (25Donoviel D.B. Hadjantonakis A.K. Ikeda M. Zheng H. Hyslop P.S. Bernstein A. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2801-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). These cells lack γ-secretase activity and accumulate C83 (C-terminal 83 residues of β-APP), and to a minor extent C99 (C-terminal 99 residues of β-APP), and were here used as substrate in the γ-secretase activity assay. BD8 cells were cultured in ES medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2.4 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, 0.1 mm mercaptoethanol, and non-essential amino acids) and washed in PBS before they were harvested in PBS and centrifuged at 1500 × g for 5 min. The pellet was resuspended in buffer A, and the cells were homogenized by several strokes at 1800 rpm with a high torque mortar-driven pestle. All centrifugations were carried out at 4 °C. Unbroken cells and nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 15 min. BD8 membranes were collected from the supernatant by centrifugation at 140,000 × g for 1 h. The pellet was solubilized in solubilization buffer and incubated 1 h at 4 °C with rotation. Unsolubilized membranes were spun down at 140,000 × g for 15 min. The protein concentration was measured by spectrophotometer analysis. The solubilized mitochondria and membrane fractions were treated with γ-secretase inhibitors l-685,458 (0.25, 1, and 5 μm) (Bachem) or Compound E (0.25, 1, and 5 μm) (Merck) or Me2SO and left on ice for 10 min before the solubilized BD8 fractions were added in a ratio 5:3 and incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. Control samples without inhibitors were either incubated at 37 °C for 16 h or frozen down at -20 °C. The γ-secretase cleavage products were separated on 16.5% self-cast SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The production of β-APP intracellular domain (AICD) was detected with monoclonal antibody C1/6.1 raised against the C-terminal of APP. Recombinant C100-Flag (tagged at the C-terminal of APP) was used as an alternative substrate. C100-Flag was purified essentially as described by Li et al. (26Li Y.M. Lai M.T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.P. Yin K.C. Shafer J.A. Gardell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6138-6143Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Briefly, C100-Flag was PCR-amplified from a C99 expression plasmid using the primers 5′-ATTACCATGGATGCAGAATTCCGA-3′ and 5′-ATATCTCGAGCTACTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGTTCTGCATCTGCTCAAAGAA-3′. The PCR product was digested with NcoI and XhoI and directionally cloned into pTriEx (Novagen). Recombinant C100-Flag (DYKDDDDK) fusion was produced by overexpression in BL-21 codon plus RP Escherichia Coli (Stratagene). The protein was purified using Anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin (Sigma) as per manufacturer's instructions except with 1% Nonidet P-40 in the elution buffer (27Esler W.P. Kimberly W.T. Ostaszewski B.L.

Identification of a Mitochondrial Targeting Sequence in NCT—An iPSORT data base search for targeting sequences in NCT revealed dual targeting sequences. Amino acids 8-32 in the N-terminal region are an ER-targeting domain. In the sequence immediately following, five positively charged residues that resemble a mitochondrial targeting peptide are found at positions 38, 39, 46, 52, and 58 (Fig. 1). Similar dual targeting sequences have been found in other proteins like P4501A1 (28Addya S. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Biswas G. Bhagwat S.V. Mullick J. Avadhani N.G. J.

Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 41-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1). Other iPSORT searches did not reveal any mitochondrial targeting sequences in APH-1aL, PEN-2, PS1, or PS2 (not shown). Immunoelectron Microscopy Studies of Brain Mitochondrial Fractions and Brain Tissue Slices—Immunoelectron microscopy studies of mitochondrial fractions and tissue slices showed an abundance of NCT in mitochondria (Fig. 2A). NCT was detected with a C-terminal antibody and found to be located in the inner parts of the mitochondria with gold particles tending to form clusters. The results from the tissue section clearly show that immunolabeling of NCT is predominantly located in mitochondria and that the fractionation procedure did not affect this staining pattern (Fig. 2A). Preabsorbtion of the NCT antibody with the peptide used for immunization (KADVLFIAPREPGAVSY) abolished NCT labeling in mitochondria (Fig. 2B). Preabsorbtion of the NCT antibody with an unrelated peptide (TELPAPLSYFQN) resulted in NCT immunolabeling similar to controls (Fig. 2B). Our previous demonstration of PS1 being located in mitochondria (21Ankarcrona M. Hultenby K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2002; 295: 766-770Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) was confirmed both in fractions and tissue (Fig. 2A). The levels of PS1 were lower as compared with NCT. Similar results were obtained when mitochondrial fractions or brain tissue were stained with antibodies directed to APH-1 and PEN-2 (Fig. 2A). Both APH-1 and PEN-2 were clearly located in mitochondria but at lower levels as compared with NCT. Immunoblot Studies of Percoll-purified Mitochondria—The mitochondrial fractions obtained from centrifugations in a mannitol buffer were further purified on a Percoll gradient. The purity of the fractions was examined by Western blot using markers for different organelles. These fractions were enriched in mitochondria as indicated by a high reactivity to anti-Hsp60 (Fig. 3). The lack of KDEL, GM130, Syntaxin-13, and N-cadherin immunoreactivity in the mitochondrial fractions indicated that these were free from ER, cis-Golgi, early endosomes, and plasma membranes, respectively (Fig. 3). Immunoblot studies (SDS-PAGE) revealed the expression of NCT, PS1, APH-1, and PEN-2 in the Percoll-purified mitochondria. It thus appears that all four components of the γ-secretase complex are located in mitochondria (Fig. 4A, top panel). To investigate whether the observed γ-secretase components are associated in a protein complex we performed BN-PAGE on Percoll-purified mitochondrial fractions. With this technique it is possible to analyze the intact γ-secretase complex, because the gel is run under non-denaturing conditions. This technique was used in our laboratory to detect γ-secretase complexes in homogenates from the human brain (32Farmery M.R. Tjernberg L.O. Pursglove S.E. Bergman A. Winblad B. Naslund J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24277-24284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). BN-PAGE showed that NCT, PS1, APH-1, and PEN-2 could be detected in high molecular mass complexes running at ∼500 kDa (Fig. 4A, bottom panel). In addition, we also detected PS2 in complexes running at the same molecular mass indicating that both PS proteins are present in mitochondria (not shown). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments, using NCT or PS1-NTF (Ab14) antibodies for precipitation and PS1-CTF antibody for detection, also revealed that these proteins interact in mitochondria (Fig. 4B).Fig. 4SDS-PAGE, BN-PAGE, and immunoprecipitation of components of the γ-secretase complex.

https://openalex.org/W2103019017,"Expression of GFP and other fluorescent proteins depends on cis-regulatory elements. Because these elements rarely direct expression to specific cell types, GFP production cannot always be sufficiently limited. Here we show that reconstitution of GFP, YFP, and CFP previously split into two polypeptides yields fluorescent products when coexpressed in C. elegans. Because this reconstitution involves two components, it can confirm cellular coexpression and identify cells expressing a previously uncharacterized promoter. By choosing promoters whose expression patterns overlap for a single cell type, we can produce animals with fluorescence only in those cells. Furthermore, when one partial GFP polypeptide is fused with a subcellularly localized protein or peptide, this restricted expression leads to the fluorescent marking of cellular components in a subset of cells."

EGFR signaling is important for the development of many tissues, including skin, lungs, intestines, and the craniofacial skeleton. We have now determined the role of EGFR signaling in endochondral ossification. We analyzed long bone development in EGFR-deficient mice. EGFR deficiency caused delayed primary ossification of the cartilage anlage and delayed osteoclast and osteoblast recruitment. Ossification of the growth plates was also abnormal resulting in an expanded area of growth plate hypertrophic cartilage and few bony trabeculae. The delayed osteoclast recruitment was not because of inadequate expression of matrix metalloproteinases, including matrix metalloproteinase-9, which have previously been shown to be important for osteoclast recruitment.

Inhibition of EGFR tyrosine kinase activity decreased the generation of osteoclasts from cultured bone marrow cells. Skeletal elements develop by two distinct mechanisms: intramembranous and endochondral ossification (1Caplan A.I. Ciba Found. Symp. 1988; 136: 3021Google Scholar). Endochondral ossification is a process by which a cartilaginous template is first formed and then replaced by bone. During embryogenesis, condensations of mesenchymal cells form, within which chondrocytes develop, proliferate, and differentiate to form a cartilage template that contains distinct zones of resting, proliferative, and hypertrophic chondrocytes. The proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes within the cartilage template are spatially ordered, with proliferating cells at the two ends of the template and progressively more mature cells forming hypertrophic cartilage in the middle. Hypertrophic chondrocytes secrete a specialized extracellular matrix (ECM) 1The abbreviations used are: ECM, extracellular matrix; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; M-CSF, monocyte-colony stimulating factor; MEM, minimal essential medium; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase; RT, reverse transcriptase; HC, hypertrophic cartilage; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; E, embryonic day. containing collagen X, which becomes calcified. Endochondral ossification begins with the invasion of the calcified hypertrophic cartilage by blood vessels, accompanied by osteoclasts and osteoblasts (primary ossification center). The function of osteoclasts is to remove the hypertrophic cartilage ECM and that of osteoblasts is to replace it with bone ECM. Longitudinal bone growth is accomplished by the continuing proliferation and maturation of chondrocytes at the ends of the cartilage template (the growth plates) to form more hypertrophic cartilage and its continual removal and replacement by bone (growth plate ossification or formation of primary spongiosa). Normal endochondral bone development requires the exquisite coordination of hypertrophic cartilage formation, vascular invasion, and the development and function of osteoclasts and osteoblasts (2Olsen B.R.

EFGR expression has been detected in the axial and appendicular skeleton at the bone-cartilage junction (17Martineau-Doize B. Lai W.H. Warshawsky H. Bergeron J.J. Endocrinology. 1988; 123: 841-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), suggesting a role for this signaling pathway in endochrondral bone formation. Overexpression of EGF in transgenic mice using the β-actin promoter results in growth retardation and overproliferation of osteoblasts, consistent with a role for EGFR in osteoblastic cell growth (18Chan S.Y. Wong R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38693-38698Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A recent study showed that EGFR-deficient mice have impaired endochondral ossification, probably secondary to a defect in hypertrophic chondrocyte maturation and osteoblastic cell proliferation (19Sibilia M. Wagner B. Hoebertz A. Elliott C. Marino S. Jochum W. Wagner E.F. Development. 2003; 130: 4515-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, in cultured fetal rat long bones, EGF stimulates bone resorption, suggesting that EGFR signaling also plays a role in osteoclast function (20Raisz L.G. Simmons H.A. Sandberg A.L. Canalis E. Endocrinology. 1980; 107: 270-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). In this study, we showed that impaired recruitment of osteoclasts contributed to the impaired endochondral bone formation in EGFR-deficient mice and that EGFR signaling is necessary for osteoclast formation from bone marrow progenitors. Reagents—AG1478 was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Mouse macrophage colony stimulating factor (mouse M-CSF) was purchased from R&D (Minneapolis, MN). Recombinant murine RANK ligand (rm-sRANKL) was purchased from PeproTech, Inc. (Rocky Hill, NJ). Minimum essential (MEM) α-medium with ribonucleosides and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Invitrogen and Ficoll-Hypaque was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Histological Analyses—The generation of the EGFR-null allele by homologous recombination in ES cells was previously described (11Miettinen P.J. Berger J.E. Meneses J. Phung Y. Pedersen R.A. Werb Z. Derynck R. Nature. 1995; 376: 337-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). EGFR+/+ and EGFR+/mice were genotyped by PCR for the targeted allele. Mice heterozygous for the null allele (EGFR+/-) were mated and the day of the vaginal plug is designated as E0.5. Pregnant mice were sacrificed at E16.5 and E18.5, the embryos were removed, and the long bones dissected for analyses. In some experiments, long bones from newborn pups from heterozygous mating are collected. EGFR-/- embryos or newborn pups were recognized by their obvious phenotype of open-eyed (15Miettinen P.J. Chin J.R. Shum L. Slavkin H.C. Shuler C.F. Derynck R. Werb Z. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 69-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Bones were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline overnight and decalcified in 0.5 m EDTA (pH 7.4) for 1–3 days at 4 °C prior to processing for paraffin embedding. E16.5 bones were not decalcified. For general morphology, sections were stained with Masson Trichrome stains using a kit from Sigma according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. In Situ Hybridization—Complementary DNAs corresponding to Cbfa-1 (Runx2), osteocalcin, collagen-type I, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), MMP-13 (collagenase-3), and MMP-14 (MT1-MMP) were used to generate [35S]UTP-labeled antisense riboprobes using a transcription kit from Promega (Madison, WI). In situ hybridization was performed as described previously (21Albrecht U. Eichele G. Helms J.A. Lu H. Daston G.P. Molecular and Cellular Methods in Developmental Toxicology. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1997: 23-48Google Scholar). Briefly, slides were deparaffinized, treated with proteinase K (20 μg/ml) for 5 min at ambient temperature, and hybridized with 35S-labeled antisense riboprobes in hybridization buffer (50% deionized formamide, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mg/ml yeast tRNA, 10% dextran sulfate, and 1× Denhardt's) in a humidified chamber at 55 °C overnight. Following hybridization, the slides were treated with RNase A, washed to a final stringency of 50% formamide, 2× SSC at 60 °C, dipped in emulsion, exposed for 1–4 weeks, developed, and counter-stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Gelatin Substrate Gel Analyses—The long bones were dissected from E16.5 and E18.5 EGFR-/- and EGFR+/? embryos and homogenized in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, pepstatin). Insoluble aggregates and nuclei were removed by centrifugation and protein concentration of the supernatants was quantified using the BCA protein assay reagent kit (Pierce). Samples (10 μg of protein) were added to nondenaturing loading buffer and separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 1 mg/ml gelatin (Sigma). Gels were washed two times in 2.5% Triton X-100 at ambient temperature for 30 min each, then incubated in substrate buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm CaCl2, 0.02% sodium azide) at 37 °C overnight. Gels were then fixed and stained in 30% isopropyl alcohol, 10% acetic acid, and 0.1% Coomassie Blue. Isolation of Bone Marrow Mononuclear Cells and Osteoclast Formation Assay—Bone marrow mononuclear cells were isolated from 6–8-week-old CD1 mice by a modified procedure from a previously described method (22Fuller K. Lean J.M. Bayley K.E. Wani M.R. Chambers T.J. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 2445-2453Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, mice were killed by cervical dislocation. Femora and tibiae were dissected free of soft tissue. The ends of the bone were cut, and bone marrow cells were flushed out into a cell culture dish by slowly injecting MEM at one end of the bone using a sterile 27-gauge needle. The cell suspension was filtered through a cell strainer (Falcon, 70 μm nylon) and pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 rpm at 4 °C. Cells were then resuspended in MEM containing 10% fetal calf serum, plated in a 100-mm cell culture dish at a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml, and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 overnight. The next morning the nonadherent cells were collected, centrifuged, and purified on a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient. The monocyte cell layer was aspirated carefully from the medium and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells were counted, resuspended in MEM containing 2.5% fetal bovine serum, and placed in a 24-well plate at 4 × 104 cells/ml. To each of these wells, growth factor (25 ng/ml M-CSF and 25 ng/ml RANKL) and either vehicle (Me2SO) or AG1478 at different concentrations (1.25, 2.5, and 5 μm) were added. The culture medium was changed every 3 days. After 6 days of culturing, osteoclast formation was evaluated by quantification of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive multinucleated osteoclast cells as described below. TRAP Staining—The osteoclast preparations were stained for TRAP activity using a leukocyte acid phosphatase kit from Sigma. Briefly, after culturing for 6 or 8 days, cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 37% formaldehyde (formalin) in acetonecitrate buffer for 1 min, and stained according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. All the osteoclasts in one well were counted under the microscope after counterstaining with hematoxylin as TRAP+ cells containing at least three nuclei. The results were expressed as mean ± S.D. of triplicate samples. TRAP staining was also performed on the paraffin sections according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. The determination of the numbers and distribution of TRAP+ cells in longitudinal sections of bones were performed as described previously (23Blavier L. Delaisse J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3649-3659PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of EGFR mRNA in Osteoclasts by RT-PCR—Total RNAs from cultures of osteoclast cells, and from EGFR-/- and EGFR+/+ embryonic heads were isolated using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer and dissolved in 50 μl of nuclease-free water. Concentration of the RNA preparations was quantified by absorbance at 260 nm. EGFR mRNA expression was determined using one tube access reverse transcription (RT)-PCR system (Promega). Total RNA (1 μg) was added to a RT mixture containing 1× AMV/Tfl reaction buffer, 0.2 mmol/liter dNTP mixture, 1 mmol/liter MgSO4, 0.1 units/μl AMV reverse transcriptase, 0.1 units/μl Tfl DNA polymerase, and 1 μmol/liter of each EGFR primer in a total volume of 50 μl. The EGFR forward primer (5′-CTGCCAAGGCACAAGTAACA-3′) spans nucleotides 304–323 of the mouse EGFR gene and the reverse primer (5′-ATTGGGACAGCTTGGATCAC-3′) spans nucleotides 783–802. The RT reaction was carried out at 48 °C for 40 min. PCR was carried out for 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 56 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s. PCR products were analyzed on a 1.5% agarose gel. Northern Blotting—Total RNAs from cultured osteoclasts, EGFR-/- and EGFR+/+ embryonic heads were isolated as described above. Total RNA (20 μg) was electrophoresed through a 1% denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to Hybond-N+ membrane (Amersham Biosciences), and then cross-linked by UV irradiation. Blots were prehybridized for 1 h at 68 °Cin QuikHyb™ reagent (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and then hybridized with a random primed 32P-labeled EGFR probe overnight at 68 °C. Blots were washed at a final stringency of 60 °C in 0.2× SCC + 0.1% SDS and then exposed to Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences) at -70 °C. The EGFR probe used was provided by Dr. Janice Liu at the University of Washington, Seattle, WA (24Wilson S.E. Chen L. Mohan R.R. Liang Q. Liu J. Exp. Eye Res. 1999; 68: 377-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). The probe contains residues 969–1242 of the rat EGFR cDNA. Bone Marrow Cell Culture Proliferation Assay—Bone marrow mononuclear cells were isolated as described above and seeded in 96-well culture plates at a density of 20,000 cells/well with MEM supplemented with 2.5% fetal bovine serum, 25 ng/ml M-CSF, 25 ng/ml RANKL. Either vehicle (Me2SO) or different concentrations of AG1478 (1.25, 2.5, and 5 μm) were added to the wells. Cells were then incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. After 48 h, the number of viable cells was measured by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide uptake method. Briefly, 10 μl of a 5 mg/ml 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide solution was added to 100 μl of culture medium in each well and the cells were incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 4 h. 100 μl of 10% SDS in 0.01 n HCl was then added to each well overnight and the color reaction was determined by absorbance at 570 nm. Six wells were used for each treatment, and experiments were repeated 3 times. Bone Resorption Assay—Osteoclast resorption was performed on calcium phosphate-coated discs (BD Biosciences Biocoat Osteologic discs). Bone marrow cells were isolated and cultured on osteologic discs in the presence of M-CSF and RANKL in MEM with 10% fetal calf serum. After osteoclasts form, the medium was changed to resorption medium (MEM adjusted to pH 7.0 with HCl with 10% fetal calf serum), and either Me2SO or AG1478 (5 μm) was added. After 2 days, the discs were bleached to remove cells, washed in water, and air-dried. Resorption pits were visualized under light microscopy. Images were taken with a digital camera and analyzed using Adobe Photoshop. Images were visualized in gray scale and inverted. Areas of resorption pits were outlined, and under the histogram function, the percentage of pixels in the top 25% of the gray scale range contained in the outlined area was calculated as the percent resorption area. Statistical analysis was done using the Student's t test. EGFR-/- Mice Show Delayed Primary Endochondral Ossification and Lengthened Growth Plate Hypertrophic Cartilage Zones—EGFR-null mice generally die within the first postnatal day because of severe respiratory distress (14Miettinen P.J. Warburton D. Bu D. Zhao J.S. Berger J.E. Minoo P. Koivisto T. Allen L. Dobbs L. Werb Z. Derynck R. Dev. Biol. 1997; 186: 224-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied skeletal development during embryonic development. In the data that follows, we show the humerus; however, similar phenotypes were seen in the radius, ulna, and in the hind limbs. Primary ossification in the wild type and EGFR+/- bones occurred normally with humeri at E16.5 showing completed invasion of capillaries into the calcified hypertrophic cartilage (HC), with the resultant removal of the middle section of the HC and replacement of this area with vascularized tissues (Fig. 1A). In contrast, in the EGFR-/- humeri, the middle section of the EGFR-/- HC remained intact, indicating delayed primary ossification (Fig. 1B). At E18.5, ossification in the wild type/heterozygous humeri continued in the longitudinal direction resulting in the formation of an area of trabecular bone (primary spongiosa) and a growth plate that contained an area of hypertrophic cartilage of relatively small size (Fig. 1C). However, at E18.5, the EGFR-/- humeri showed a lengthened HC zone at the growth plate and ossification that had not proceeded very far longitudinally (Fig. 1D). This delay in ossification continued until birth, with continuing accumulation of HC at the growth plates in newborn EGFR-/- mice compared with their wild type or heterozygous littermates (Fig. 1, E and F). Trabecular bone formation was also impaired in EGFR-/- mice. In E18.5 wild type or heterozygous humeri, the primary spongiosa area was large and contained many long trabeculae (Fig. 1G), but in the EGFR-/- humeri, there were only a few short trabeculae (Fig. 1H). This impairment in bone formation persisted until birth, and the differences in trabecular bone were also seen in newborn mice (Fig. 1, I and J). We concluded that primary ossification of the cartilage templates and the subsequent ossification of the growth plates of the long bones are impaired in the EGFR-/- mice. This occurs in the absence of overall growth retardation in utero. Because the EGFR-/- mice die soon after birth, and those that survive for a few days to weeks are severely growth retarded, we did not analyze postnatal development. Because heterogeneous mice did not show a bone phenotype, the EGFR wild type and heterozygote embryos were used interchangeably in the results that follow. For simplicity they are referred to as wild type. EGFR-/- Mice Have Delayed Osteoclast Recruitment into Hypertrophic Cartilage—We next determined the EGFR-dependent mechanisms in endochondral ossification. A key event in primary ossification of the hypertrophic cartilage anlage is the recruitment of osteoclasts. Mononuclear hematopoietic precursors are disseminated via the bloodstream and deposited in the mesenchyme surrounding the bone rudiments. There, they proliferate and differentiate into TRAP+ cells that are the precursors of multinucleated osteoclasts (3Karsenty G. Wagner E.F. Dev. Cell. 2002; 2: 389-406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1198) Google Scholar). These (pre)osteoclasts invade the HC together with blood vessels and initiate the resorption of HC (25Engsig M.T. Chen Q.J. Vu T.H. Pedersen A.C. Therkidsen B. Lund L.R. Henriksen K. Lenhard T. Foged N.T. Werb Z. Delaissé J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 879-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). During this migration into HC the mononucleated (pre)osteoclasts fuse together to form the multinucleated mature osteoclasts. We saw many TRAP+ cells within the middle section of the HC in the E16.5 wild type humeri (Fig. 2A). In contrast, TRAP+ cells were found mainly at the periphery of the HC in the EGFR-/- humeri (Fig. 2B). Quantification of the number of these cells on serial sections showed a significant difference in the number of TRAP+ cells inside versus outside the calcified HC between wild type and EGFR-/- bones (Fig. 2G). There were no apparent differences in the size of the TRAP+ cells. There were also no differences in the number of nuclei per TRAP+ cell between wild type and EGFR-/- mice (data not shown). The difference in the number of TRAP+ cells inside the calcified HC between EGFR-/- and wild type bones diminished by E18.5 (Fig. 2, C–G). These results indicate that the delayed primary ossification of EGFR- deficient HC is coupled with a delay in osteoclast recruitment. Impaired Bone Formation in EGFR-/- Mice Is Due in Part to Delayed Osteoblast Recruitment—During primary ossification, concurrent with vascular invasion and osteoclast recruitment, osteoblasts also migrate from the bony collar into the hypertrophic cartilage. Because bone formation was also impaired in the EGFR-/- humeri, we asked whether the recruitment of osteoblasts into the EGFR-/- HC was also delayed. We assayed for the expression of the transcription factor Cbfa-1, a marker of osteoblast differentiation (26Ducy P. Zhang R. Geoffroy V. Ridall A.L. Karsenty G. Cell. 1997; 89: 747-754Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3647) Google Scholar, 27Komori T. Yagi H. Nomura S. Yamaguchi A. Sasaki K. Deguchi K. Shimizu Y. Bronson R.T. Gao Y.H. Inada M.

Cell. 1997; 89: 765-771Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2412) Google Scholar) and for the expression of osteocalcin, a marker of mature osteoblasts (29Lian J.B. Stein G.S. Stewart C. Puchacz E. Mackowiak S. Aronow M. Von Deck M. Shalhoub V. Connect. Tissue Res. 1989; 21 (69): 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In E16.5 wild type and heterozygous humeri, many Cbfa-1-positive cells were found in the middle of the HC zone, whereas in the EGFR-/- bones, these cells were found more at the periphery (Fig. 3, A and B). Similarly, osteocalcin-positive cells were found in the middle of the HC zone of E16.5 wild type humeri, but they were largely limited to the periphery in the EGFR-/- bones (Fig. 3, C and D). Thus the delay in primary ossification of EGFR-/- HC is also coupled to a delay in recruitment of osteoblasts. However, by E18.5, there were many osteocalcin-positive cells in EGFR-/- bones at the cartilage bone junction (Fig. 3, E and F). Yet, there were still few trabecular spicules in these bones, and few osteocalcin-positive cells on these spicules (Fig. 3, E and F). The deficiency in trabecular spicules persisted until birth (see Fig. 1, G–J). These data suggested that development of osteoblast in EGFR deficiency might be normal, but their subsequent proliferation, survival, and/or function might be impaired. The functional impairment is not because of a deficiency in osteoblast differentiation as measured by collagen I expression, however, because in situ hybridization showed abundant collagen type I mRNA expression at the EGFR-/- growth plates (Fig. 3, G and H). Osteoclasts Express EGFR—The delay in osteoclast recruitment into EGFR-/- HC may be because of either a direct effect of EGFR signaling in osteoclasts and/or osteoclast precursors or an indirect effect because of EGFR function on other cells that in turn regulate osteoclasts. To determine whether EGFR ligands can act directly on osteoclasts, we determined expression of EGFR by osteoclasts. We isolated wild type bone marrow cells from CD1 mice and cultured them in vitro with M-CSF and RANK ligand to induce the formation of osteoclasts. We then determined the expression of EGFR in cultured osteoclasts by RT-PCR and Northern blotting. Total RNAs were isolated from primary cultures of osteoclasts and from the heads of wild type and EGFR-/- E18.5 embryos for positive and negative controls, respectively. RT-PCR was performed using a forward primer in exon 1 and a reverse primer in exon 4 to distinguish wild type EGFR mRNA and any residual mRNA from the targeted allele, which has a disrupted exon 2. We observed the expression of EGFR mRNA in osteoclasts and wild type embryonic heads (Fig. 4A). As expected, no PCR product corresponding to EGFR was seen in the EGFR-/- embryonic heads. On Northern blot, two transcripts of ∼9.6 and 5 kb were found in osteoclast cultures and wild type embryonic heads (Fig. 4B). No transcripts were found in EGFR-/- embryonic heads. These data suggest that EGFR ligands may act directly on osteoclasts to affect their function. Delayed Primary Osteoclast Recruitment in EGFR-null Mice Is Not Because of Deficiency in MMPs—Previous studies showed that MMPs were necessary for the migration of (pre)osteoclasts into calcified hypertrophic cartilage during primary endochondral ossification (23Blavier L. Delaisse J.M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3649-3659PubMed Google Scholar). In particular, MMP-9 (gelatinase B) is required for the timely recruitment of these cells. MMP-9-deficient mice show a delay in osteoclast recruitment into the calcified hypertrophic cartilage during primary endochondral ossification of the metatarsals (25Engsig M.T. Chen Q.J. Vu T.H. Pedersen A.C. Therkidsen B. Lund L.R. Henriksen K. Lenhard T. Foged N.T. Werb Z. Delaissé J.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: 879-890Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Because EGFR signaling can modulate the cellular expression of MMPs, the delay in osteoclast recruitment into the EGFR-/- HC may be because of deficiency in the expression of MMPs. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the expression of several MMPs by in situ hybridization. The expression of MMP-9 and MMP-14 (MT1-MMP), which are highly expressed in osteoclasts (30Reponen P.

In E16.5 wild type humeri, MMP-9 expression was found in cells corresponding to osteoclasts in the vascularized bone marrow cavity and at the cartilage-bone junction (Fig. 5, A and C). In the E16.5 EGFR-/- humeri, MMP-9 expression was found in cells at the pe"
https://openalex.org/W2077044475,"Multicellular organisms must integrate growth and differentiation precisely to pattern complex tissues. Despite great progress in understanding how different cell fates are induced, it is poorly understood how differentiation decisions are temporally regulated. In a screen for patterning mutants, we isolated alleles of tsc1, a component of the insulin receptor (InR) growth control pathway. We find that loss of tsc1 disrupts patterning due to a loss of temporal control of differentiation. tsc1 controls the timing of differentiation downstream or in parallel to the RAS/MAPK pathway. Examination of InR, PI3K, PTEN, Tor, Rheb, and S6 kinase mutants demonstrates that increased InR signaling leads to precocious differentiation while decreased signaling leads to delays in differentiation. Importantly, cell fates are unchanged, but tissue organization is lost upon loss of developmental timing controls. These data suggest that intricate developmental decisions are coordinated with nutritional status and tissue growth by the InR signaling pathway."

The transcriptional regulation of the gene encoding cartilage link protein (CRTL1) is largely unknown, however.

Christner J.E. Baker J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 3519-3535Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A major component of cartilage extracellular matrix, CRT-LP stabilizes aggregates of aggrecan and hyaluronic acid (HA). The three functional domains of CRT-LP include an Ig-fold, which interacts with the aggrecan G1 domain, and two proteoglycan tandem repeats that mediate binding to HA. CRT-LP binds aggrecan along the HA chain in a 1:1 stoichiometry (2Neame P.J. Barry F.P. Experientia. 1993; 49: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 3Morgelin M. Paulsson M.

J. 1994; 303 (Pt. 1): 329-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The resulting aggregates are entrapped within the mesh-like network of type II collagen fibrils, producing a large, stable macromolecular structure that contributes to compression resistance and shock absorption in the joint (2Neame P.J. Barry F.P. Experientia. 1993; 49: 393-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 3Morgelin M. Paulsson M. Hardingham T.E. Heinegard D. Engel J. Biochem.

CRT-LP is expressed in numerous non-cartilaginous tissues, such as mesonephros, brain, and sclera. However, the phenotype associated with loss of function of the CRT-LP gene, CRTL1, is restricted to the skeleton; CRTL1-null mice exhibit a perinatally lethal chondrodysplasia. The cartilage in these mice contains significantly reduced aggrecan depositions in the hypertrophic zone and decreased numbers of prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes (5Watanabe H. Yamada Y. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Cartilage-specific transgene expression of CRTL1 can completely prevent perinatal mortality in CRTL1-null mice and rescue skeletal abnormalities at levels dependent upon the amount of CRT-LP expression (6Czipri M. Otto J.M. Cs-Szabo G. Kamath R.V. Vermes C. Firneisz G. Kolman K.J. Watanabe H. Li Y. Roughley P.J. Yamada Y. Olsen B.R. Glant T.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39214-39223Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In addition, CRT-LP may function as a growth factor to up-regulate the synthesis of aggrecan and type II collagen in cartilage (7McKenna L.A. Liu H. Sansom P.A. Dean M.F. Arthritis Rheum. 1998; 41: 157-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Thus, production of CRT-LP at appropriate levels is crucial to the formation of proteoglycan aggregates and the normal organization of hypertrophic chondrocytes. To date, however, the mechanisms that control CRTL1 expression remain largely unknown. A key transcriptional regulator of chondrogenesis is SOX9, a member of the SOX (Sry-type HMG box) family, that is characterized by a reduced amino acid sequence within the HMG (high mobility group) domain (8Wegner M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 1409-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar, 9Pevny L.H. Lovell-Badge R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1997; 7: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Prechondrogenic mesenchyme cells with a homozygous deletion of SOX9 are unable to differentiate into chondrocytes and cannot express chondrocyte-specific matrix genes such as Col2a1, Col9a2, Col11a2, and Agc1 (10Bi W. Deng J.M. Zhang Z. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 85-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1361) Google Scholar). In developing mouse embryos, SOX9 expression closely parallels that of Col2a1 (11Bell D.M. Leung K.K. Wheatley S.C. Ng L.J. Zhou S. Ling K.W. Sham M.H. Koopman P. Tam P.P. Cheah K.S. Nat.

These findings indicate that cartilage genes might have common mechanisms for transcriptional regulation and suggest a role for SOX9 in regulating CRTL1 expression. In this study, we have shown that the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of CRTL1 contains a cis-acting element that is directly regulated by SOX9. SOX9 can induce CRTL1 expression in human non-chondrocytic cell lines, mesenchymal stem cells, and adult dermal fibroblasts. We also show that the 5′-UTR of CRTL1 contains another cis-acting element that responds in a cell type-specific manner and is independent of SOX9. Cell Culture—HuH-7 cells were obtained from the Riken Cell Bank (Tsukuba, Japan), and HeLa cells were obtained from the Japanese Collection of Research Bioresource Cell Bank (Osaka, Japan). HEK293 cells were purchased from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). All cell lines were cultured at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM)-high glucose supplemented with penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum. OUMS-27 cells were obtained from the Institute for Fermentation, Osaka Animal Cell Bank (Osaka, Japan) and cultured in DMEM-high glucose supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg/ml) and 10% fetal bovine serum. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) and human adult dermal fibroblasts (hDFB) were purchased from Cambrex (East Rutherford, NJ). The hMSC line was cultured in MSC growing medium, and the hDFB line was cultured in DMEM-high glucose supplemented with penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum. For all cultures, the growth medium was replaced every 3–4 days. SOX Plasmids and Adenoviruses—Full-length cDNAs of SOX9, L-SOX5, and SOX6 were amplified by PCR. DNA sequences of PCR products were verified by automated DNA sequencing (model 3700; ABI, Foster City, CA) and then cloned into pEGFP-C1 or pShuttle mammalian expression vectors (Clontech). Adenoviral expression vectors containing L-SOX5, SOX6, and SOX9 were constructed using the AdenoX expression system (Clontech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The adenoviruses were packed and amplified in HEK293 cells and then purified using the AdenoX virus purification kit (Clontech). Virus titers were estimated using the AdenoX rapid titer assay kit (Clontech). Induction of Adenoviruses into hMSC and hDFB—Confluent hMSC and hDFB cultures were transduced with SOX-expressing adenoviruses at a multiplicity of infection of 50. SOX-induced hMSC and hDFB cells were collected 2 days after transduction and gently centrifuged into pellets (5 × 105 cells/pellet). Cell pellets were cultured in serum-free high-glucose DMEM. After 3, 7, 14, and 21 days of pellet culture, mRNA was harvested from cell pellets, and gene expression levels were measured using a real-time PCR assay. Three-dimensional cultures on collagen gel matrices were produced using the 3D-Collagen Cell Culture System (Chemicon, Temecula, CA). Two days after transduction, SOX-transduced hMSC and hDFB cells were seeded onto DMEM-containing collagen gel matrices at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/cm2 in 24-well tissue culture plates. After 7, 14, and 21 days of three-dimensional culture in serum-free high-glucose DMEM, mRNA was harvested from cells and subjected to real-time PCR. RNA Interference (RNAi)—The pSilencer2.1-U6 neo expression vector kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. RNAi target sequences for human SOX9 mRNA were selected using a small interfering RNA target design online tool (www.takarabio.co.jp/rnai/intro.htm) and were analyzed by a BLAST search to ensure the gene specificity. Several small interfering RNA constructs were tested, and the most effective one was used. The target sequence was 5′-AACTCCAGCTCCTACTACAGC-3′. OUMS-27 cells were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in 12-well tissue culture plates. Using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science), 1 μg of a small interfering RNA construct or an empty vector was transfected. Two days after transfection, mRNAs were harvested from two independent wells and subjected to real-time PCR. Real-time Quantitative PCR Assays—Total RNAs from cells were isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and treated with DNaseI. Total RNAs (50 ng-1 μg) were reverse transcribed into cDNA using the Taqman core reagent kit (ABI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Subsequently, 1 μl of each room temperature reaction was used as a template for the second step of SYBR Green reverse transcribed PCR (Qiagen). A partial cDNA of CRTL1 and SOX9 was amplified by PCR (using the primer sequences 5′-TCACACAGAGGTGGCAATGT-3′ and 5′-TGCCTCCCTTCAGAAACACT-3′, 5′-CATGAGCGAGGTGCACTCC-3′ and 5′-TCGCTTCAGGTCAGCCTTG-3′, respectively) and cloned into the pCR-TOPOII vector (Invitrogen). SYBR Green PCR amplification and real-time fluorescence detection were performed using the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system. PCR cycling conditions were as follows, 94 °C for 15 min followed by 40 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Construction of CRTL1 Plasmids—CRTL1-luciferase fusion genes were constructed in the pGL3-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). All CRTL1 fragments were amplified by PCR using a primer pair that contained MluI- or XhoI-cleaved restriction sites at the 5′-ends. The 35-bp wild type and mutant fragments were synthesized as double-stranded oligonucleotides containing MluI-cleaved sites at both ends (Sigma Genosis, Tokyo, Japan). These fragments were multimerized to create sequences of 2–4 tandem repeats (Fig. 6). All plasmid constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. Luciferase Reporter Assays—Plasmid DNA transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science). Cells were plated at a density of 5 × 104 cells/well in 24-well tissue culture plates. Luciferase reporter plasmids were co-transfected with the pRL-TK plasmid as an internal control for transfection efficiency. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was measured using the PG-DUAL-SP reporter assay system (TOYO Ink, Tokyo, Japan). Relative transcriptional activity was expressed as a ratio of luciferase reporter gene activity from the experimental vector to that from the internal control vector. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—Wild type (WT) and mutant (m-1) probes were prepared by annealing 35-bp complementary oligonucleotides labeled with digoxigenin (DIG)-11-ddUTP. DNA-protein binding reactions were performed using a DIG gel shift kit (Roche Applied Science). SOX9 protein was synthesized using the TNT transcription/translation system (Promega), and nuclear extracts from various cell lines were prepared as previously described (21Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9131) Google Scholar). Supershift experiments were performed with purified SOX9 antibody (provided by Drs. Tomoatsu Kimura, Toyama Medical and Pharmaceutical University, and Yoshihiko Yamada, NIDCR, National Institutes of Health) (22Liu Y. Li H. Tanaka K. Tsumaki N. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 12712-12718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Competition experiments were performed by preincubating in vitro translated SOX9 or nuclear extract with excess unlabeled oligonucleotides prior to adding labeled oligonucleotides. Reaction mixtures were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. DNA-protein complexes were resolved on 6% Tris-boric acid-EDTA gels (Invitrogen), and signal was detected using a chemiluminescent detection system (Roche Applied Science). CRTL1 Induction by SOX9 in Human Non-chondrocytic Immortalized Cell Lines—We examined the effect of SOX9 on CRTL1 expression in the human non-chondrocytic cell line HuH-7. Endogenous CRTL1 expression is undetectable in this cell line. 2I. Kou and S. Ikegawa, unpublished data. Transient transfection of plasmids expressing green fluorescent protein-tagged SOX genes into HuH-7 cells produced easily detectable levels of SOX protein expression, with peak expression observed 48–72 h following transfection (data not shown). In SOX9-transfected cells, endogenous CRTL1 expression increased gradually beginning at 48 h after transfection and was remarkably elevated from 72 until 96 h after transfection (Fig. 1). Previous studies of other cartilage matrix genes, including Col2a1, Col11a2, and Agc1, have shown that the transcriptional activity of SOX9 is enhanced by the co-activators L-SOX5 and SOX6 (23Lefebvre V. Li P. de Crombrugghe B. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5718-5733Crossref PubMed Scopus (668) Google Scholar, 24de Crombrugghe B. Lefebvre V. Behringer R.R. Bi W. Murakami S. Huang W. Matrix Biol. 2000; 19: 389-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar, 25Lefebvre V. Behringer R.R. de Crombrugghe B. Osteoarthr. Cart. 2001; 9: S69-S75Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether L-SOX5 and SOX6 could enhance the effect of SOX9 on CRTL1 expression. In cells co-expressing SOX9, L-SOX5, and SOX6, CRTL1 expression increased sooner, beginning at 24 h after transfection (Fig. 1). However, both L-SOX5 and SOX6 appear to have no direct effect on CRTL1 expression. These results suggest that SOX9 can regulate endogenous CRTL1 in addition to other major cartilage matrix genes and that L-SOX5 and SOX6 may enhance the transcriptional activity of SOX9. CRTL1 Induction by SOX9 in hMSC and hDFB Cells—To confirm SOX9-mediated regulation of CRTL1 expression in other cell lines, we evaluated the effect of SOX9 on CRTL1 expression in hMSC cells. Two days after adenovirus transduction of SOX9, hMSCs were collected into small pellets and cultured in serum-free growth medium. We detected an increase in CRTL1 mRNA expression 3 days after SOX9 transduction, and expression levels remained elevated for 3 weeks following transduction. We observed similar patterns of CRTL1 mRNA expression in cells co-transduced with SOX9, L-SOX5, and SOX6 (Fig. 2A). In addition, we examined whether CRTL1 could be induced by SOX9 in well differentiated mesenchymal cells such as hDFB. In hDFB cells, CRTL1 expression was first inducted at Day 3 of pellet culture, and expression levels remained increased for 3 weeks (Fig. 2B). We further examined CRTL1 induction in hMSC and hDFB cells using a three-dimensional culture system. Interestingly, SOX9 with L-SOX5 and SOX6 could co-activate CRTL1 expression more strongly than SOX9 alone (Fig. 3). These results indicate that SOX9 is a key regulator of CRTL1 and that CRTL1 can be induced by SOX9 in both differentiated and undifferentiated human mesenchymal cells. Reduction of CRTL1 Expression by RNAi for SOX9 —To test whether SOX9 is necessary for CRTL1 expression, we inhibited SOX9 expression using small interfering RNA in a human chondrosarcoma cell line, OUMS-27, which normally expresses high levels of SOX9 and CRTL1 (data not shown). OUMS-27 cells were transfected with an RNAi expression plasmid or a control vector. GAPDH mRNA levels were similar in test cells and mock controls (data not shown). The SOX9 RNAi reduced SOX9 mRNA levels to ∼50% of the original level and resulted in inhibition of CRTL1 expression (Fig. 4). Thus, SOX9 is necessary to maintain expression of CRTL1. Transcriptional Activity of the 5′-Flanking Sequence of CRTL1 in Non-chondrocytic Cells—To examine whether CRTL1 transcription is directly regulated by SOX9, we measured the effect of SOX9 expression on transcriptional activity from the 5′-flanking sequence of the CRTL1 gene. We performed transient transfection assays in several non-chondrocytic cell lines (HuH-7, HeLa, and HEK293) using the construct pCRT1, which contains ∼1.2 kb of the 5′-flanking sequence (–924 to +318) of the CRTL1 gene (NM_001884.1). In cells co-transfected with the SOX9 plasmid, transcriptional activity from the pCRT1 plasmid was greatly increased relative to control experiments (Fig. 5). This observation suggests that the transcriptional activity of CRTL1 is directly regulated by SOX9 and that a regulatory region resides within the 1.2-kb region. Next, we tested the effect of SOX9 on pCRT2, which contains a 3′-deletion of the flanking sequence (–924 to –3). Transcriptional activity from pCRT2 was considerably lower than that from pCRT1 in cells co-transfected with SOX9, further indicating that a SOX9-responsive element resides within the 3′-segment of the 1.2-kb enhancer fragment (–2 to +318), the 5′-UTR of the CRTL1 gene (Fig. 6). To localize the cis-element within the 5′-UTR, we constructed plasmids containing various 5′-deletions of the ∼400-bp enhancer fragment (–69 to +318). A 5′-deletion to +117 retained almost complete enhancer activities, whereas a 5′-deletion to +177 showed remarkably decreased activity (Fig. 6). These experiments localized the minimal enhancer element to the sequence between nucleotides +117 and +177. Sequence analysis of this region identified a motif that is identical to consensus SOX binding sequences, with the exception of a 1-bp mismatch (Fig. 7A, CACAAAG, +120 to +126). Next, we tested the SOX9-dependent enhancer activity of multiple, tandemly arranged copies of the 35-bp enhancer element containing the putative SOX binding motif. In all cell lines co-transfected with the SOX9 plasmid, SOX9-dependent activity increased in correlation with the number of enhancer element repeats (Fig. 7B). Substitution of a 3-bp sequence within the motif abolished enhancer activity, indicating that this sequence is critical to SOX activity (Fig. 7, A and C). Binding of SOX9 to the CRTL1 Enhancer Sequence—We used EMSA to determine whether SOX9 binds the 35-bp 5′-UTR cis-element directly. Incubation of a DIG-labeled WT probe with in vitro translated SOX9 protein resulted in the formation of a DNA-protein complex that could be competed with an excess amount of unlabeled probe (Fig. 8A). Mutated probes containing the 3-bp substitution within the enhancer element were unable to form complexes (Fig. 8B). Incubation with a SOX9-specific monoclonal antibody produced a super-shift of the DNA-SOX9 complex (Fig. 8A, lane 2). Together, these observations indicate that the 35-bp fragment interacts specifically with SOX9 through the consensus SOX9 binding motif. Function of the SOX9-dependent Enhancer Element in a Chondrocytic Cell Line—To examine whether the SOX9-dependent enhancer element is functional in chondrocytes, we performed transient transfection assays using a human chondrosarcoma cell line, OUMS-27. In the experiment, the 35-bp SOX9-dependent element showed enhanced transcriptional activity, which was abolished by mutation of the SOX9 binding motif (Fig. 9). This result suggests that the SOX9-dependent enhancer element is involved in the regulation of CRTL1 expression in chondrocytes. Identification and Characterization of the SOX9-independent Enhancer Element—During the course of our examination of regulatory elements within the 5′-UTR, we tested the effects of sequential 3′-deletions within this sequence. Deletion of ∼100-bp from the 3′-end significantly decreased enhancer activity (data not shown). This deleted region contains four putative SOX binding motifs. Therefore, we hypothesized that a second enhancer element might exist within this region. To localize and characterize this potential element, we created multimers of two sequence fragments, each of which contained two of the four putative SOX binding motifs. We cloned the multimers downstream of a CRTL1 promoter (–336 to –3) that was not enhanced by SOX9 (data not shown) and then tested their transcriptional activity in three non-chondrocytic cell lines. A 40-bp enhancer element (+218 to +257) exhibited activity that was most pronounced in HEK293 cells; this activity increased depending on copy number but was independent of SOX9 (Fig. 10, A and B). These results suggest the presence of a SOX9-independent cis-element in the 40-bp fragment that responds to some transcription factors expressed specifically in HEK293 cells. Sequence analysis of the 40-bp fragment identified no known binding motifs, aside from the SOX motifs, for transcription factors involved in regulating chondrogenesis. To determine whether the SOX9-independent enhancer element is functional in chondrocytes, we performed transient transfection assays using OUMS-27 cells and found the element was active in the cells (Fig. 10C). This result suggests the SOX9-independent enhancer element is also involved in the regulation of CRTL1 expression in chondrocytes. To examine the basis for the cell type-specific activity of the SOX9-independent element, we performed EMSA assays using nuclear extracts from various cell lines. Four DNA-protein complexes were found in the nuclear extracts from HEK293 cells (Fig. 11A). Complex 3 was found in HEK293 and OUMS-27 cells where the SOX9-independent enhancer element was active, whereas it was barely visible in HuH-7 and HeLa cells where the element was inactive. The binding of the DNA-protein complexes was specific (Fig. 11B). Therefore, it is likely that some transcription factor(s) that is specifically expressed in HEK293 and OUMS-27 cells binds to the 40-bp enhancer element and transactivates CRTL1 independent of SOX9. We have demonstrated that SOX9 can regulate the transcriptional activity of CRTL1 through a heptameric SOX-binding site within the 5′-UTR. Other major cartilage matrix genes, including Col2a1, Col11a2, and Agc1, also are regulated by SOX9 through heptameric SOX binding elements (16Bridgewater L.C. Lefebvre V. de Crombrugghe B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14998-15006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 18Sekiya I. Tsuji K. Koopman P. Watanabe H. Yamada Y. Shinomiya K. Nifuji A. Noda M. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 2336-2346Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, SOX9-dependent regulation is considered to be a common mechanism for transcriptional regulation of cartilage matrix genes. Most SOX9 binding elements in the Col2a1, Col11a2, and Agc1 genes are localized to the first intron within each gene. In contrast, the intron 1 sequence of CRTL1 contains no similar regulatory regions and is not highly conserved between species. Comparison of the human and mouse genomic sequences revealed that the SOX9-dependent cis-element within 5′-UTR is highly conserved (more than 90% identity), suggesting that transcriptional regulation of CRTL1 by SOX9 is a common mechanism between species. SOX9 appears to function as the master regulator of CRTL1. Our RNAi analysis shows that SOX9 is necessary for CRTL1 expression. We also found that SOX9 effectively induces CRTL1 in human cells, even in non-chondrogenic cell lines and in differentiated and undifferentiated mesenchymal cells. However, we observed a delay between the time of SOX9 transduction and induction of CRTL1 mRNA expression. This finding suggests the presence of additional factor(s) that are regulated by SOX9 and mediate SOX9 function. Likely candidates for this role include the SOX9 transcriptional co-activators L-SOX5 and SOX6, which are known to be induced by SOX9 and cooperate with SOX9 to induce COL2A1 expression (11Bell D.M. Leung K.K. Wheatley S.C. Ng L.J. Zhou S. Ling K.W. Sham M.H. Koopman P. Tam P.P. Cheah K.S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 174-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (749) Google Scholar, 27Binette F. Cravens J.

Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Our present experiments using HuH-7 cells support this suggestion, as CRTL1 induction in cells transduced with SOX9, L-SOX5, and SOX6 began earlier than that in cells expressing SOX9 alone. By Day 4, however, CTRL1 induction levels were equivalent under both experimental conditions. This effect of L-SOX5 and SOX6 to SOX9 is not consistent among all cartilage matrix genes, however. For example, SOX9-mediated transcription from the COL9A1 promoter is not stimulated by L-SOX5 and SOX6 (19Zhang P. Jimenez S.A. Stokes D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 117-123Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). In the pellet culture of hMSC and hDFB cells, we observed no additive effect of L-SOX5 and SOX6 to SOX9 activity, whereas SOX9 expression itself was sufficient for CRTL1 induction. In contrast, L-SOX5 and SOX6 have a marked additive effect on SOX9 activity in the three-dimensional culture of hDFB and MSC cells. Our findings indicate that the regulatory mechanism of SOX9 will differ between genes and is likely specific to cell type and/or stages of differentiation. We have also demonstrated the presence of another sequence element within the 5′-UTR that shows strong, SOX9-independent enhancer activity. In contrast to the SOX9-dependent element, the activity of the element is cell type-specific. Binding experiments using nuclear extracts from chondrocytic and non-chondrocytic cell lines showed a cell type-specific binding pattern with a DNA-protein complex that was specific to the cells where the SOX9-independent element is active. These observations suggest that the difference in enhancer activity between the cell lines results from the difference in the transfactor(s) in the cells. In this context, original tissues of OUMS-27 and HEK293 cells are chondrocyte and kidney, respectively, where the CRTL1 expression is strong (27Binette F. Cravens J. Kahoussi B. Haudenschild D.R. Goetinck P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19116-19122Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, we speculate that one or more factors in addition to SOX9 contribute to transcriptional regulation of CRTL1. The expression profile of CRTL1 and SOX9 during chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation is consistent with this idea; CRTL1 is expressed in hypertrophic chondrocytes, where SOX9 expression is no longer detectable (12Ng L.J.

Comparison of the human and mouse genomic sequences revealed that the SOX9-independent cis-element within 5′-UTR is also highly conserved (∼80% identity), suggesting that this regulatory region has an important role in the transcriptional mechanism of CRTL1.

In addition, they have domains that mediate protein-protein interactions, including one Src homology 2 (SH2) and two Src homology 3 (SH3) domains. Vav1, Vav2, and Vav3 play a crucial role in the regulation of phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) isoforms by immuno-tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-coupled receptors, including the T- and B-cell antigen receptors.

Oncogene. 1996; 13: 363-371PubMed Google Scholar, 15Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7870-7885Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 16Henske E.P. Short M.P. Jozwiak S. Bovey C.M. Ramlakhan S. Haines J.L. Kwiatkowski D.J. Ann. Hum. Genet. 1995; 59: 25-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The guanine nucleotide exchange activity of Vav proteins is specific for the Rho family of small G proteins. Vav1 has been shown to selectively activate Rac1, Rac2, RhoG, and to a lesser extent, RhoA. Vav2 and Vav3 activate RhoA and RhoG but show less activity toward Rac1 (15Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7870-7885Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 17Schuebel K.E. Movilla N. Rosa J.L. Bustelo X.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6608-6621Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). The GTP/GDP exchange activity of all three Vav family proteins is modulated through phosphorylation on tyrosine by Src and Syk family kinases. Interestingly, however, tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav1 by GPVI in platelets is not associated with activation of Rac demonstrating that additional factors are also required for activation of the Rho family G protein (12Pearce A.C. Wilde J.I. Doody G.M. Best D. Inoue O. Vigorito E. Tybulewicz V.L. Turner M. Watson S.P. Blood. 2002; 100: 3561-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Vav proteins are prominent tyrosine kinase substrates downstream of activation of ITAM receptors, including the T-cell and B-cell antigen receptors (15Movilla N. Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7870-7885Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 18Bustelo X.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 1461-1477Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 19Turner M. Billadeau D.D. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 2: 476-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Vav family proteins interact with several of the proteins in the ITAM-dependent signaling cascades, including Syk and Zap70, SLP-76 and Blnk, Grb2, Nck, and the p85 regulatory subunit of PI 3-kinase. Insights into the specific roles of members of the Vav family in hematopoeitic cells have come from studying mice engineered to lack individual or combinations of these proteins. T-cell proliferation is severely retarded in Vav1-deficient mice. Vav1–/–T-cells and thymocytes are also defective in their ability to phosphorylate PLCγ1 and mobilize Ca2+ in response to T-cell receptor cross-linking. Significantly, the proliferation defects can be partially rescued through restoration of the Ca2+ flux with ionophore (20Costello P.S. Walters A.E. Mee P.J. Turner M. Reynolds L.F. Prisco A. Sarner N. Zamoyska R. Tybulewicz V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3035-3040Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Cytoskeletal remodeling, formation of cap structures, and T-cell receptor clustering are also defective in Vav1-deficient T-cells (21Fischer K.D. Kong Y.Y. Nishina H. Tedford K. Marengere L.E.

The loss of Vav1 from B-cells causes mild defects in B-cell development and signaling via the B-cell receptor (23Gulbranson-Judge A. Tybulewicz V.L. Walters A.E. Toellner K.M. MacLennan I.C. Turner M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1999; 29: 477-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). However, Vav2 is also required for these processes and a stronger phenotype is seen in Vav1/Vav2-deficient B-cells, demonstrating a degree of redundancy in this system. Vav1–/–Vav2–/– mice display a block in B-cell development and a severe impairment of phosphorylation of PLCγ2 and Ca2+ mobilization following antigen receptor triggering (24Doody G.M. Bell S.E.

Charlesworth A. Chan G. Sakk V. Barbacid M. Fischer K.D. Nat. Immunol. 2001; 2: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Vav3 is also expressed in B- and T-cells and has recently been shown to play a role in regulating PLCγ phosphorylation downstream of the B- and T-cell receptors (26Inabe K. Ishiai M. Scharenberg A.M. Freshney N. Downward J. Kurosaki T. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 189-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 27Fujikawa K. Miletic A.V. Alt F.W. Faccio R. Brown T. Hoog J. Fredericks J. Nishi S. Mildiner S. Moores S.L. Brugge J. Rosen F.S. Swat W. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1595-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). It is presently unclear whether the role of Vav family proteins downstream of ITAM receptors is a consequence of their GDP/GTP exchange factor activity or through their function as adapter proteins. The striking phenotype observed in the absence of Vav1 or Vav2 in T- and B-cells contrasts with the minimal phenotype observed in GPVI-activated platelets (12Pearce A.C. Wilde J.I. Doody G.M. Best D. Inoue O. Vigorito E. Tybulewicz V.L. Turner M. Watson S.P. Blood. 2002; 100: 3561-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Potentially, this can be explained by the presence of Vav3, which is also expressed in platelets and undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation upon engagement of the fibrinogen receptor, αIIbβ3 (28Obergfell A. Eto K. Mocsai A. Buensuceso C. Moores S.L. Brugge J.S. Lowell C.A. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Alternatively, the lack of a role for Vav1 and Vav2 in platelets may represent a novel mechanism of ITAM coupling to PLCγ. In the present study, we demonstrate that Vav3 is tyrosine phosphorylated downstream of GPVI in platelets but that, as with Vav1, platelets deficient in Vav3 are activated normally by GPVI. Strikingly, however, platelets double-deficient in Vav1 and Vav3 show a marked impairment in functional responses, which is associated with loss of phosphorylation of PLCγ2. A similar phenotype is seen in platelets deficient in all three Vav proteins. Some of this work has previously been presented in abstract form (29Pearce A.C. Vigorito E. Senis Y.A. Billadeau D.D.

Compound knock-out mice were generated by appropriate crossing of the individual knock-out genotypes. Mutant and control mice were age- and background-matched. All animals were maintained using housing and husbandry in accordance with local and national legal regulations. Preparation of Human Platelets—Blood was taken by forearm venepuncture from healthy, drug-free volunteers on the day of the experiment into 1:10 (v:v) sterile sodium citrate. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was obtained by centrifugation at 200 × g for 20 min. Platelets were isolated from PRP by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 10 min in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml prostacyclin. The platelet pellet was resuspended in modified Tyrodes-HEPES buffer (134 mm NaCl, 0.34 mm Na2HPO4, 2.9 mm KCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 20 mm HEPES, 5 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, pH 7.3). The platelets were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml prostacyclin and 1:9 (v:v) acid citrate dextrose (120 mm sodium citrate, 110 mm glucose, 80 mm citric acid) and resuspended at a concentration of 5 × 108/ml in Tyrodes-HEPES buffer. Preparation of Mouse Platelets—Blood was taken from a terminally CO2-narcosed mouse by cardiac puncture on the day of the experiment into 1:10 (v:v) acid citrate dextrose. Blood was diluted 1:6 (v:v) in Tyrodes-HEPES and centrifuged at 200 × g to obtain PRP. PRP was centrifuged in the presence of 0.1 μg/ml prostacyclin at 1000 × g. The platelet pellet was resuspended at a concentration of 5 × 108/ml in Tyrodes-HEPES. Platelet Stimulation and Aggregation—Mouse platelets were used at a concentration of 2 × 108/ml. For all protein studies, lotrafiban (10 μm), indomethacin (10 μm), and apyrase (2 units/ml) were included in the resuspension buffer unless otherwise stated. Stimulation of platelets was performed in a PAP-4 aggregometer (Bio/Data Corp., Horsham, PA) with continuous stirring at 1200 rpm at 37 °C for the times shown. Aggregation of platelets was monitored by measuring changes in light transmission in the absence of lotrafiban, indomethacin, and apyrase. Platelets were preincubated with PP1 (20 μm), PP2 (20 μm), PD0173952 (25 μm), LY294002 (20 μm), BAPTA-AM (40 μm), and Ro 318220 (10 μm) for 10 min prior to stimulation. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Platelets were lysed with an equal volume of 2× lysis buffer (2% Nonidet P-40, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, 200 μg/ml 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A, pH 7.4). Insoluble cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 5 min at 13,000 × g, 4 °C, and cell lysates were precleared using protein A-Sepharose. Platelet lysates were incubated with the indicated primary antibodies, and the resulting protein complexes and immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (12Pearce A.C. Wilde J.I. Doody G.M. Best D. Inoue O. Vigorito E. Tybulewicz V.L. Turner M. Watson S.P. Blood. 2002; 100: 3561-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) with detection by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences, Bucks, UK). Murine thymocytes and splenocytes in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were lysed with an equal volume of 2× lysis buffer and insoluble cell debris removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g, 4 °C. The protein concentration of each sample was measured using the Bio-Rad RC DC protein assay using the manufacturer's instructions. Static Adhesion Spreading Assay—Glass microscope slides were coated with 100 μg/ml Horm collagen solution overnight at 4 °C followed by washing with PBS. Slides were then blocked using 1% heatdenatured bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h, followed by washing in PBS. Mouse platelets, suspended in Tyrodes-HEPES at a concentration of 3 × 107 platelets/ml, were transferred to the slides and incubated at 37 °C for 45 min in a humid atmosphere. Excess platelets were removed and the platelets adhered to the slides fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature. The coverslips were washed in PBS, mounted using Immuno Fluore Mounting Medium (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, CA) and viewed under differential interference contrast microscopy under a 63× oil immersion lens and Slidebook software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations). Adhesion under Flow—Whole mouse blood was isolated in sodium heparin (10 IU/ml) as described previously (33Best D. Senis Y.A. Jarvis G.E. Eagleton H.J. Roberts D.J. Saito T. Jung S.M. Moroi M. Harrison P. Green F.R. Watson S.P. Blood. 2003; 102: 2811-2818Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Blood was perfused through glass microslides, with inner diameter 1 × 0.1 mm (Camlab, Cambridge, UK), which had been coated with 30 or 100 μg/ml Horm collagen overnight at 4 °C before blocking with 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS at room temperature for 1 h. A shear rate of 800 s–1, with a corresponding flow rate of 0.08 ml/min, was generated by a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus, Southnatick, MA). After 2-min perfusion with whole blood, modified phosphate-free Tyrodes buffer was perfused for 8 min through the microslides at the same shear rate. Platelet thrombi that formed on the surface of the collagen were visualized with an inverted stage video microscope system (DM IRB, Leica, UK). Subsequently, adherent platelets were lysed in 1× ice-cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Proteins were separated and blotted as above. Vav3 Is Tyrosine-phosphorylated in Response to Activation of GPVI—To investigate a potential role for Vav3 downstream of GPVI, we analyzed Vav3 tyrosine phosphorylation in platelets stimulated with the GPVI-specific agonist, CRP, or collagen. Aggregation and inside-out signals from the integrin αIIbβ3 were blocked using the antagonist lotrafiban and positive feedback signals arising from ADP and thromboxanes were inhibited using apyrase and indomethacin, respectively. CRP stimulated robust tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav3 within 20 s, which was sustained for at least 300 s (Fig. 1a). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav3 was maximal between 3 and 10 μg/ml CRP (Fig. 1b). Collagen also stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav3, although the response is weaker than that induced by CRP, which is consistent with its more powerful action (Fig. 1c). Vav3 is tyrosinephosphorylated in murine platelets in response to CRP and collagen, with the former again giving a more robust response (Fig. 1d). These results highlight a potential role for Vav3 in the GPVI signaling cascade. Vav3 Phosphorylation Is Dependent on Src, Syk, and Btk/Tec Tyrosine Kinases—The regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav3 was investigated using a variety of inhibitors and genetically modified murine platelets. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav3 by CRP was abolished in the presence of the Src family kinase inhibitors, PP1 and PP2, and the structurally unrelated Src kinase inhibitor PD0173952 confirming that Vav3 lies downstream of the GPVI signaling cascade (Fig. 1e), although it may not necessarily be regulated directly by Src kinases. Vav3 tyrosine phosphorylation was also abolished in response to CRP in murine platelets deficient in the tyrosine kinase Syk (data not shown) and reduced in platelets deficient in the Tec family kinases, Btk, and Tec (Fig. 1f). In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav3 was not altered in the presence of the protein kinase C inhibitor Ro 318220 (10 μm), the intracellular calcium chelator, BAPTA-AM (40 μm), or the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002 (20 μm) (Fig. 1e). These results show that CRP-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav3 is completely dependent on Src family kinases and Syk and is partially dependent on Tec family kinases. These results emphasize that Vav3 is regulated downstream of GPVI but do not directly identify the tyrosine kinase(s) that mediates phosphorylation. Impaired Activation of Vav1/Vav3 Double-deficient Platelets by GPVI Agonists—Vav3-deficient mice were used to monitor the functional role of the protein in platelet activation by GPVI. Aggregation of Vav3-deficient platelets in response to stimulation by CRP (Fig. 2a) and collagen (data not shown) was not significantly different from that in controls. Similarly, the ability of platelets to spread and form lamellipodia on a surface of immobilized collagen was not significantly altered in the absence of Vav3 (Fig. 2b). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk, LAT, SLP-76, and PLCγ2 in response to CRP was also not altered in Vav3-deficient platelets (Fig. 2c). In view of the redundancy between Vav family members in B-cells, and also the marked tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav1 that has been reported in both human and murine platelets, we investigated responses in the absence of both Vav1 and Vav3. Aggregation of Vav1/Vav3-deficient murine platelets in response to CRP or collagen was strongly reduced (Fig. 3a), although at maximal concentrations of CRP a small shape change response and weak aggregation could be seen (Fig. 3a). In comparison, aggregation to a submaximal concentration of the G protein-coupled receptor agonist thrombin was not altered (Fig. 3a). Spreading of Vav1/3-deficient platelets on collagen was also largely abolished, with very few cells exhibiting signs of activation such as formation of filopodia (Fig. 3b). To investigate the role of Vav family proteins in a more physiological setting, we assayed the ability of Vav1/Vav3-deficient platelets to adhere to a collagen matrix under flow conditions at a flow rate that is typically found in small arterioles. Whole blood from Vav1/Vav3-deficient or wild type mice was flowed through a collagen-coated capillary tube at a shear force of 800 s–1 for 2 min. The capillary tube was then washed and analyzed by phase-contrast light microscopy. The capillary tubes were subsequently flushed with lysis buffer and the resulting lysates blotted for actin as an indication of total platelet protein. Robust thrombus formation was observed in wild type platelets, whereas this was restricted to adhesion of single platelets in the absence of Vav1/Vav3 (Fig. 3c(i)). This reduction in platelet recruitment was confirmed by the reduction in the level of actin (Fig. 3c(ii)). To investigate the molecular basis of the defect in platelet activation in the absence of Vav family proteins, we measured tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2, the major PLCγ isoform in platelets, in platelet suspensions stimulated by CRP. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 was reduced in Vav1/3-deficient platelets but was not abolished (Fig. 3d). This is in contrast to the result observed in the absence of either Vav isoform alone, where phsophorylation is not altered. In contrast, tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk, which lies upstream of phosphorylation of Vav1 and Vav3, was not altered (Fig. 3d). In addition, there was a slight reduction in tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 and LAT in Vav1/Vav3-deficient platelets (Fig. 3d). These results demonstrate a redundant role of Vav1 and Vav3 in the regulation of PLCγ2 and platelet activation by GPVI. This role is downstream of the tyrosine kinase Syk and may be mediated in part through regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT and SLP-76. These results are consistent with a role for Vav1 and Vav3 in the assembly of the PLCγ2 signalosome in platelets. Platelets from Vav1/2/3-deficient Mice Are Identical to Platelets from Vav1/3-deficient Mice—To investigate whether the residual response observed in the absence of Vav1 and Vav3 was due to the presence of Vav2, we compared activation of Vav1/Vav3 double-deficient platelets with Vav1/Vav2/Vav3 triple-deficient cells. The triple-deficient platelets displayed the same decrease in aggregation (Fig. 4a) and spreading (data not shown) to collagen and CRP that is seen in the combined absence of Vav1/Vav3. The Vav1/Vav2/Vav3 triple-deficient cells exhibit residual shape change and aggregation in response to a high concentration of CRP (Fig. 4a). This is accompanied by a residual degree of tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 in response to CRP. Syk phosphorylation was not altered (Fig. 4b). Thrombin-induced aggregation of Vav1/Vav2/Vav3 triple-deficient platelets was not significantly altered relative to controls (Fig. 4a). These results demonstrate that Vav2 is unable to compensate for the loss of Vav1 and Vav3 in platelets and indicate that it does not play a functional role in the GPVI signaling cascade. Furthermore, they also show that GPVI is able to mediate weak tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 in the absence of Vav family proteins. Expression of Vav Proteins Is Not Affected by the Absence of Other Vav Isoforms—To investigate whether the redundancy between Vav1 and Vav3 was due to up-regulation of expression of the other isoforms within the family, lysates of Vav1-, Vav3-, and Vav1/3-deficient platelets were Western blotted for other Vav isoforms (Fig. 5a). The level of expression of Vav1 in platelets deficient in Vav3 was similar to that in wild type platelets (Fig. 5a, left panels). A similar picture is seen for expression of Vav3 in the presence or absence of Vav1 (Fig. 5a, middle panels). Expression of Vav2 is not affected by deficiency of Vav1 and Vav3 (Fig. 5a, right panels). In all cases, the level of expression of actin was measured as a marker of platelet protein and was found to be similar under all conditions. These results demonstrate that the redundancy observed between Vav1 and Vav3 is real rather than being a consequence of compensatory up-regulation in the knock-out models. One potential explanation for the apparent absence of a functional role of Vav2 in platelets is that it is expressed at a much lower level than the other two isoforms. To address this, we compared the level of expression of all three Vav isoforms in murine platelets to that in murine splenocytes and thymocytes, which are rich in B-cells (70%) and T-cells (95%), respectively. It is relevant in this context that a role for Vav2 in B-cells (24Doody G.M. Bell S.E. Vigorito E. Clayton E. McAdam S. Tooze R. Fernandez C. Lee I.J. Turner M. Nat.

Immunol. 2001; 2: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar) and T-cells (27Fujikawa K. Miletic A.V. Alt F.W. Faccio R. Brown T. Hoog J. Fredericks J. Nishi S. Mildiner S. Moores S.L. Brugge J. Rosen F.S. Swat W. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1595-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) has been reported. The same amount of total protein from platelets, splenocytes, and thymocytes was separated by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted for Vav1, Vav2, and Vav3. The level of expression of Vav1 and Vav3 is similar in murine platelets, splenocytes, and thymocytes, consistent with the functional role of these isoforms in platelets, B-cells and T-cells (Fig. 5b). In comparison, the level of expression of Vav2 is significantly lower in murine platelets than in splenocytes and thymocytes. These data are consistent with the functional role of Vav2 in B-cells and T-cells and the lack of a role for the isoform in platelets. Tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav family proteins is necessary for guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity and forms docking sites for interactions with other signaling proteins via SH2 domains. Here we show that Vav3 is tyrosine-phosphorylated following stimulation of the ITAM-coupled collagen receptor GPVI in platelets. To our surprise, however, activation of Vav3-deficient platelets by GPVI is indistinguishable from that of wild type cells. Vav1 has previously been reported to be tyrosine-phosphorylated by GPVI, and Vav1-deficient platelets exhibit minimal impairment in activation by GPVI (12Pearce A.C. Wilde J.I. Doody G.M. Best D. Inoue O. Vigorito E. Tybulewicz V.L. Turner M. Watson S.P. Blood. 2002; 100: 3561-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Significantly, in this study we show that platelets deficient in both Vav1 and Vav3 exhibit a marked reduction in functional responses to GPVI, which is associated with a reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2. A similar level of impairment in response is seen in platelets deficient in Vav1, Vav2 and Vav3, providing evidence against a role for Vav2 in the GPVI signaling cascade. This is consistent with the observation that Vav2 expression is very low in platelets relative to that in B-cells where a functional role has been reported. Furthermore, Vav2 does not undergo tyrosine phosphorylation upon engagement of GPVI (12Pearce A.C. Wilde J.I. Doody G.M. Best D. Inoue O. Vigorito E. Tybulewicz V.L. Turner M. Watson S.P. Blood. 2002; 100: 3561-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) even in the absence of Vav1 and Vav3 (data not shown). Vav1 and Vav3, but not Vav2, therefore play redundant roles in mediating platelet activation by GPVI. GPVI, like other ITAM-coupled receptors such as B- and T-cell antigen receptors, requires Vav family proteins to efficiently activate PLCγ. The residual aggregation and phosphorylation of PLCγ2 that was seen in the absence of Vav family proteins in platelets demonstrates that GPVI is able to signal to a minimal extent in the absence of the GDP/GTP family of exchange factors. A similar observation was made in Vav1/Vav2/Vav3 triple-deficient B-cells, which exhibit a weak Ca2+ flux in response to B-cell receptor cross-linking (27Fujikawa K. Miletic A.V. Alt F.W. Faccio R. Brown T. Hoog J. Fredericks J. Nishi S. Mildiner S. Moores S.L. Brugge J. Rosen F.S. Swat W. J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 1595-1608Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Thus, while Vav family proteins play a critical role in regulation of PLCγ isoforms, it appears that their function can be by-passed to a very limited degree. This observation resembles the case for many of the other proteins that are recruited to the GPVI-driven PLCγ2 signalosome in platelets. For example, a residual degree of platelet activation in response to GPVI is seen in platelets deficient in the Tec kinases, Btk and Tec (9Atkinson B.T. Ellmeier W. Watson S.P.

Duronio V. Krystal G. Watson S.P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2793-2802Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Thus, it appears that the GPVI signaling pathway requires a large number of proteins for optimal regulation of PLCγ2 but that a limited degree of signaling can take place in their absence. Thus it seems as if very few proteins are absolutely essential for the regulation of PLCγ2 but that the majority are required for optimal signaling through the cascade. The mechanism through which Vav proteins regulate PLCγ isoforms is unclear. Vav proteins have been proposed to control PLCγ activity at the level of substrate supply. One such model is that Vav activates phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase via Rac1 in B-cells, thereby increasing levels of the PLCγ substrate, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (35O'Rourke L.M.

However, Rac1 is not activated by GPVI in platelets (12Pearce A.C. Wilde J.I. Doody G.M. Best D. Inoue O. Vigorito E. Tybulewicz V.L. Turner M. Watson S.P. Blood. 2002; 100: 3561-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In addition, Vav proteins have been shown to directly bind the p85α catalytic subunit of PI 3-kinase (36Weng W.K. Jarvis L. LeBien T.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32514-32521Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is noteworthy, however, that inhibition of PLCγ1 phosphorylation is greater in Vav1–/–thymocytes than in the presence of PI 3-kinase inhibition demonstrating that its role is not simply to maintain the formation of 3-phosphorylated lipids (37Reynolds L.F. Smyth L.A. Norton T. Freshney N. Downward J. Kioussis D. Tybulewicz V.L. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1103-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). The observation that the inducible association of PLCγ1 with the SLP-76·Gads complex is defective in Vav1–/–thymocytes (37Reynolds L.F. Smyth L.A. Norton T. Freshney N. Downward J. Kioussis D. Tybulewicz V.L. J. Exp. Med. 2002; 195: 1103-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), coupled with the observation of reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of LAT in Vav1–/–thymocytes (38Reynolds L.F. de Bettignies C. Norton T. Beeser A. Chernoff J. Tybulewicz V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18239-18246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), suggest that the role of Vav proteins may be to stabilize the PLCγ signalosome by serving as adapters. This is consistent with the slightly reduced phosphorylation of LAT and SLP-76 observed in the present study. One observation of general interest is the apparent absence of a defect in the separation of the vascular and lymphatic systems in the double or triple deficient Vav mice, which is seen in mice-deficient in Syk, SLP-76, and PLCγ2 (39Abtahian F. Guerriero A. Sebzda E. Lu M.M. Zhou R. Mocsai A. Myers E.E. Huang B. Jackson D.G. Ferrari V.A. Tybulewicz V. Lowell C.A. Lepore J.J. Koretzky G.A. Kahn M.L. Science. 2003; 299: 247-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). This underscores the fact that impairment in platelet activation by GPVI (or by other ITAM receptors) is not responsible for this defect. In this context, it is of interest that Syk, SLP-76, and PLCγ2 also participate in signaling by integrins and that Vav1 and Vav3 are also tyrosine-hosphorylated downstream of GPIIb-IIIa in platelets (28Obergfell A. Eto K. Mocsai A. Buensuceso C. Moores S.L. Brugge J.S. Lowell C.A. Shattil S.J. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 157: 265-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar, 40Cichowski K. Brugge J.S. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7544-7550Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We previously reported a small defect in late-stage aggregation in Vav1-deficient platelets, which we attributed to a decrease in outside-in signaling through the integrin (12Pearce A.C. Wilde J.I. Doody G.M. Best D. Inoue O. Vigorito E. Tybulewicz V.L. Turner M. Watson S.P. Blood. 2002; 100: 3561-3569Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This defect was not seen in the absence of Vav3 or in the combined absence of Vav1 and Vav3 in this study, a result that may be due to the different background of the Vav3 and Vav1/Vav3 knock-out mice. In summary, we have shown that Vav1 and Vav3 play important and redundant roles in the regulation of PLCγ2 by GPVI in platelets. This redundancy is unique as it is complete; unlike Vav deficiencies in other cells, removal of either of the proteins has no discernable effect on signaling by GPVI, whereas removal of both proteins caused a dramatic reduction in ITAM-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and cell activation. This study further underscores the similarity in signaling by GPVI and the B-cell and T-cell antigen receptors and emphasizes that Vav family proteins play a universal role in the regulation of PLCγ isoforms by ITAM receptors.

Understanding the protein networks within a living cell is an ultimate goal in current biology. To convert this massive amount of information from gene expression into protein networks, tools were developed in the post-genomic era. Proteomic approaches integrating data from many organisms (see, for example, Refs. 1Canovas F.M. Dumas-Gaudot E. Recorbet G. Jorrin J. Mock H.P. Rossignol M.

Proteomics. 2004; 4: 93-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) are an essential tool for the understanding of the intracellular network of protein action. The advantages of such global approaches are also seen for medical applications (see, for example, Refs. 9Rachakonda S. Cartee L. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 775-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 10Onyango P. Curr. Cancer Drug Targets. 2004; 4: 111-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 11Cooper R.A. Carucci D.J. Curr.

Proteomics. 2004; 3: 345-354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). A further use of this technology is the analysis of post-translational modifications (e.g. Refs. 13Whelan S.A. Hart G.W. Circ. Res. 2003; 93: 1047-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar and 14Veenstra T.D. Adv. Protein Chem. 2003; 65: 161-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). And last but not least, large-scale analysis of protein complexes further complements the picture of cellular action (Ref. 15Zhu H. Bilgin M. Snyder M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2003; 72: 783-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar and references therein). For most proteomic approaches, gel-based two-dimensional systems have been coupled with mass spectrometry, which is one of the most powerful tools for protein identification (16Rowley A.

The combination of isoelectric focusing or blue native PAGE as the first dimension followed by SDS-PAGE as the second dimension is a widespread technique for the effective resolution of large numbers of soluble and membrane proteins (5Peltier J.B.

FEBS Lett. 2002; 513: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) can be separated by blue native PAGE in contrast to isoelectric focusing. Fast and unequivocal identification of the separated proteins is possible by analyzing internal peptide sequences. In contrast to conventional protein sequencing procedures, mass spectrometry allows the rapid and automated analysis of many proteins in a short time frame. Even though the advantages of this technology are a major break-through for the high throughput analysis of proteomic compositions, the technology is also limited to a certain extent. For example, identification of proteins of the same size but different abundance raises difficulties. Furthermore, the procedure of peptide production by protease in gel digestion can reveal major losses, and therefore, vanishing of the signal will be observed. A problem always present is the detectability of certain classes of peptides. One set of these is the class of transmembrane segments. The inability of detection was even used to analyze the topology of certain protein classes (29Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates J.R. II I Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4099) Google Scholar). It was determined that only 10% of all peptides from transmembrane proteins analyzed represent at least portions of the transmembrane segments (29Washburn M.P. Wolters D. Yates J.R. II I Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 242-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (4099) Google Scholar). Interestingly, some groups recently succeeded in detecting and sequencing transmembrane regions from GalP (30Venter H. Ashcroft A.E. Keen J.N. Henderson P.J. Herbert R.B. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and bacteriorhodopsin (31Hixson K.K. Rodriguez N. Camp D.G. II I Strittmatter E.F. Lipton M.S. Smith R.D. Electrophoresis. 2002; 23: 3224-3232Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Blonder J. Conrads T.P. Yu L.R. Terunuma A. Janini G.M. Issaq H.J. Vogel J.C. Veenstra T.D. Proteomics. 2004; 4: 31-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) in model studies. In contrast to previous reports, high amounts of protein were used in these experiments, and samples were digested in solution without electrophoretic separation of the proteins. However, highly purified membrane fractions are often not as concentrated as in such model studies. Since major interest has been drawn to the identification of protein networks and protein complexes, which have to be isolated and concentrated beforehand, the proteomic analysis of membranes and membrane complexes suffers from the reduced ability to detect membrane proteins due to the reduced amount of analyzable peptides. Furthermore, not all expected proteins will be detected in one biological sample since the expression of some membrane proteins is specific for certain tissues or developmental stages of the individual. We have now investigated several physicochemical parameters of peptides containing transmembrane segments by experimental and bioinformatic tools. For this, we have analyzed the thylakoid membrane by mass spectrometry and the Arabidopsis thaliana proteome by bioinformatic analysis. We specifically address the molecular forces intervening with detection of peptides from transmembrane segments by mass spectrometry. Based on the results, we propose that methionine modification by hyperoxidation or cyanogen bromide digestion, for example, could be a tool to detect an increased number of transmembrane regions by mass spectrometry. Experimental data for outer envelope proteins were extracted from previous work (33Eckart K. Eichacker L. Sohrt K. Schleiff E. Heins L. Soll J. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The topological models were constructed as described (34Schleiff E. Eichacker L.A. Eckart K. Becker T. Mirus O. Stahl T. Soll J. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 748-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The complete A. thaliana proteome was extracted from ftp://ftpmips.gsf.de/cress/arabiprot. The sequences were analyzed by TMHMM 2.0 (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/) (35Krogh A. Larsson B. von Heijne G. Sonnhammer E.L. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 305: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (9290) Google Scholar) to select proteins with proposed transmembrane segments. Native membrane and stromal protein complexes were prepared directly after isolation of chloroplasts from barley (Hordeum vulgare L. var. Steffi) as described (36Eichacker L.A. Helfrich M. Rüdiger W. Müller B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32174-32179Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Chloroplasts were lysed at 4 °C in TMK buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10 mm MgCl2, and 20 mm KCl). Membranes were isolated by centrifugation at 3800 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. After two wash steps in TMK buffer, thylakoid membranes were resuspended in 60 μl of 750 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid, 50 mm BisTris-HCl (pH 7.0), and 0.5 mm EDTA. Complexes were solubilized by incubation with 1.2% (w/v) dodecylmaltoside (final concentration) for 10 min on ice. Non-solubilized material was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. 5 μl of 5% (w/v) Serva blue G in 750 mm ϵ-aminocaproic acid was applied to the supernatant. 600 μg of solubilized proteins from thylakoids was loaded on one blue native gel lane. First Dimension—Sample solutions of membrane proteins were applied to a 6–12% blue native PAGE system (21Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Second Dimension—Individual lanes of the blue native polyacrylamide gel were cut and incubated for 15 min at room temperature in 2% (w/v) SDS, 66 mm sodium carbonate, and 2% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol at 50 ml/lane (37Eichacker, L., and Müller, B. (April 21, 2001) German Patent 1001-19-597 DE,Google Scholar). Lanes were positioned on top of the second dimension gel (12.5%, containing 4 m urea) and overlaid with a low melting agarose solution containing 0.5% (w/v) agarose, 192 mm glycine, 0.1% SDS, and 25 mm Tris at 50 °C. After electrophoresis, the resolved proteins were visualized by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 (Serva, Heidelberg, Germany), and protein spots of interest were excised with a clean scalpel and stored in Eppendorf tubes at –20 °C. Standard protein solution (Mark 12, broad-range protein standard, Novex) was provided on a piece of filter paper next to the first dimension lane. In gel digestion of proteins before subjection to mass spectrometry was carried out using the method described previously (38Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7831) Google Scholar). Mass spectrometric analyses were carried out on a Micromass Q-TOF-I hybrid mass spectrometer equipped with an orthogonal nano-electrospray ionization source operating in the positive electrospray ionization mode. Samples were loaded into medium nano-electrospray capillaries (Protana, Odense, Denmark) and positioned in the source. For external calibration, a standard solution of 0.2% (v/v) phosphoric acid (H3PO4) in 50% methanol was used. The peak at m/z 421.7589, which resulted from self-digestion of trypsin, was used for internal calibration of mass spectrometric (MS) spectra and for verification of successful digestion. To obtain optimized spectral data, a capillary voltage of 750–900 V and a cone voltage of 45 V were used. For scanning peptide MS spectra, the quadrupole was set to the appropriate mass range of m/z 350–1600, where peptides were expected. After data collection, 25 scans were averaged at a rate of 2.0 s/scan. Instrument operation, data acquisition, and analysis were performed using MassLynx/Biolynx 3.5 and 4.0 software. For peptide detection coverage analysis, the following thylakoid proteins were analyzed in detail: PsaK, PsaG, PsaH, PsaL, LhbC, PsaB, PsbA, PsbB, PsbC, PsbD, PsbE, and PsbF. For calculation of the hydrophobicity, several scales were used, viz. the hydrophobicity scale of Kyte and Doolittle (22Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17297) Google Scholar), the scale defined by Eisenberg et al. (39Eisenberg D. Schwarz E. Komaromy M. Wall R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 125-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar), and the scale of Black and Mould (40Black S.D. Mould D.R. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 193: 72-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). To calculate the mean hydrophobicity of a pool of peptides or for a protein, all hydrophobicity values of the pool or of the protein were accumulated and finally normalized by the amount of amino acids in the pool or protein. For calculation of the central region (see Figs. 5 and 6) for comparison with the calculation performed by Eisenberg et al. (39Eisenberg D. Schwarz E. Komaromy M. Wall R. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 179: 125-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (1717) Google Scholar), the hydrophobicity was calculated based on the Eisenberg scale in a window of 11 amino acids; values were normalized; and the highest value was assigned to the peptide. For the region bearing the highest hydrophobicity, the hydrophobic moment was calculated as follows (Equation 1), μH=((∑n=1NHnsin(δn))2+(∑n=1NHncos(δn))2)1/2 (Eq. 1) where μH is the hydrophobic moment, H is the hydrophobicity of the amino acid number (n), N is the window size analyzed (here, 11 amino acids), and δ is the angle of the turn between two amino acids. For classical helices as discussed here, the angle was set to 100.Fig. 6Hydrophobicity loss of oxidized methionine allows transmembrane peptide detection. A, correlation between the hydrophobicity (H) scales of Eisenberg et al. (39Eisenberg D. Schwarz E. Komaromy M. Wall R. J. Mol.

The positions of 20 amino acids (aa) with methionine (open circle) highlighted are shown. The proposed positions of the singly (Msx) and doubly (Mso) oxidized methionines (shaded squares) according to the linear relation are given. B, see the legend to Fig. 5A for details. The hydrophobicity and hydrophobic moment shift of two oxidized peptides are indicated by open circles connected by a solid line. The dashed line gives the percentage of non-detected peptides in relation to the hydrophobicity (right scale). 〈μE11〉, hydrophobic moment/amino acid using an 11-amino acid window; 〈HE11〉aa, average hydrophobicity/amino acid using an 11-amino acid window; S, soluble peptides; MS, membrane surface-localized peptides; TM, transmembrane segment. C, a Coomassie Blue-stained spot of CB23 (LhbC) from barley was cut out of a second dimension SDS gel and digested with trypsin. A positive mode electrospray (ES+) ionization Q-TOF mass spectrum was recorded, which is enlarged here between m/z 995 and 1020. 25 single spectra were averaged for this experiment. The tryptic peptide appearing at m/z 1013.52 contains two mono-oxidized methionines. The mass without modification would be m/z 997.52. The peptide sequence is given at the top.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The β-barrel score was calculated as described previously (34Schleiff E. Eichacker L.A. Eckart K. Becker T. Mirus O. Stahl T. Soll J. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 748-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 41Wimley W.C. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). For calculation of the exact β-barrel score of the peptide pool selected, the bilayer score (41Wimley W.C. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) was used. The score for each peptide was calculated for the case that the first amino acid would face the bilayer and for the case that the first residue would face the interior. The larger value was added to the exact β-score of the pool. Finally, the derived sum was divided by the number of amino acids in the pool. For analysis of the digestion frequency, the sequences were split C-terminally after arginine and lysine, and the corresponding fragments were sorted according their amino acid length. To analyze the detection probability as shown in Fig. 7C, all peptides analyzed in this work were sorted according to their hydrophobicity or their amino acid length, and the fraction of detected peptides for each parameter in a certain window was calculated. To determine the probability for detection by the two parameters hydrophobicity and length, the probability for detection at a given peptide size (P1) and at a given hydrophobicity (P2) was used to calculate the detection probability by Equation 2. P=P1·P2/((P1+P2)·0.5) (Eq. 2) Two-dimensional Protein Separation of Thylakoid Membranes—Transmembrane proteins from thylakoid membrane complexes were separated and identified in a two-dimensional blue native/SDS-PAGE system (21Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar), which was optimized for separation of hydrophobic reaction center proteins from photosystems I and II (37Eichacker, L., and Müller, B. (April 21, 2001) German Patent 1001-19-597 DE,Google Scholar). In agreement with Devreese et al. (26Devreese B. Vanrobaeys F. Smet J. Van Beeumen J. Van Coster R. Electrophoresis. 2002; 23: 2525-2533Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), we confirmed that separation and MS sequencing of membrane proteins with GRAVY scores above 0.5 are possible after separation of protein complexes by two-dimensional native SDS-PAGE. Highly hydrophobic proteins belonging to this group are, for example, cytochrome b6f gene products PetB (GRAVY score of 0.54) and PetD (GRAVY score of 0.56), reaction center II core protein PsbF (GRAVY score of 0.71), and the CF0-ATPase subcomplex unit AtpH (GRAVY score of 1.03). This indicates that the two-dimensional native/SDS-PAGE system is particularly well suited for separation of hydrophobic membrane proteins even of low molecular mass. While analyzing the membrane proteome of chloroplasts, we recognized that several expected membrane proteins were not detectable, although they were described to be associated with thylakoid membrane complexes. Although low molecular mass proteins such as PsbF (4.4 kDa) were identified, proteins of photosystems I and II <10 kDa are often hardly detected by analysis of internal peptides. Because membrane proteins may be detected by means of their hydrophilic loop regions and because “short” peptides are detected more frequently than “long” peptides, extreme hydrophobicity and the lack of internal tryptic cleavage sites may have prevented these proteins from being detected. Transmembrane Segments from Thylakoid Membrane Proteins Escape Detection by Electrospray Ionization MS—A detailed analysis of the thylakoid proteome revealed that especially membrane-inserted fragments could not be detected by mass spectrometry. To gain an understanding of this phenomenon, we analyzed the observed fragments of helical membrane proteins of the thylakoid membrane and β-barrel membrane proteins of the outer envelope of chloroplasts (33Eckart K. Eichacker L. Sohrt K. Schleiff E. Heins L. Soll J. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 557-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 34Schleiff E. Eichacker L.A. Eckart K. Becker T. Mirus O. Stahl T. Soll J. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 748-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Tryptic digestion of proteins leads to peptides of different lengths corresponding to the distribution of tryptic cleavage sites (arginine and lysine). A number of these peptides could be detected by electrospray ionization MS (MS spectra). The quality of a spectrum depends on the amount of peptide extracted from the gel, which could be partially influenced by increasing the time of measurement. However, a relevant part of peptides of thylakoid proteins predicted from in silico analysis was not detected when spectra from tryptic digests were analyzed. In our MS spectra, peptides usually emerged between m/z ∼300 and 1600. Therefore, large peptides >1.4 kDa have to be multiply charged to fit in this m/z range. However, peptides found by electrospray ionization MS normally carry charges from +2 to +4 anyway. As described previously (30Venter H. Ashcroft A.E. Keen J.N. Henderson P.J. Herbert R.B. Biochem. J. 2002; 363: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 42Wilm M. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (1719) Google Scholar), peptides >4 kDa were not detected and sequenced. To decide whether a peptide signal was present or not, peak intensity had to be >50 counts/25 averaged spectra. Doubly charged peptides <0.6 kDa (m/z 300, approximately five amino acids) were never detected in our MS spectra. A possible explanation could be charge repulsion within these peptides. For peptides longer than 15 amino acids, detectability was decreased with increased amino acid number and hydrophobicity. However, especially these long and hydrophobic peptides were of interest because tryptic digestions of α-helical membrane proteins yields peptides containing at least 20 amino acids. About 35% of all peptides should contain helical transmembrane segments (Fig. 1A, bar 3). However, when the theoretical statistical occurrence of helical transmembrane segments (Fig. 1A, bar 3) was compared with the observed occurrence of such peptides of ∼4% (bar 4), it became obvious that the detection of helical transmembrane regions is a problem. In contrast, peptides with transmembrane segments from β-barrel proteins were detected in the proposed statistical frequency (Fig. 1A, bars 1 and 2). We can therefore conclude that not the membrane insertion per se results in the loss of detection of such fragments. We subsequently analyzed the proteolytic fragments of the thylakoid proteins in more detail. All peptides were divided in two pools with regard to length. The cutoff was defined by 20 amino acids, a typical length of a transmembrane domain. We first analyzed all peptides shorter than 21 amino acids (Fig. 1B, bars 1–3). We observed an experimental coverage of ∼50% of all peptides when no dissection regarding the localization of the peptide was performed (Fig. 1B, bar 1). In contrast, when only peptides comprising soluble regions of the proteins were analyzed, 60% of all peptides predicted were experimentally observed as well (Fig. 1B, bar 2). For peptides containing membrane regions, the overall detection rate was ∼35% (Fig. 1B, bar 3) and therefore significantly smaller than the detection rate for soluble peptides. We next analyzed all peptides longer than 20 amino acids. Interestingly, the overall detection rate for such peptides was decreased to ∼15% (Fig. 1B, bar 4), and the soluble phase peptides (bar 5) were significantly reduced to ∼20% as well. However, almost no peptides of membrane proteins were detected (Fig. 1B, bar 6). We then wanted to understand why certain peptides of transmembrane proteins were detectable and others not. One physical parameter defining a transmembrane region is hydrophobicity. Therefore, the average hydrophobicity of the pool of detected (Fig. 1C, bars 2 and 4) and non-detected (bars 1 and 3) peptides was compared. Interestingly, the pool of detected peptides showed an average hydrophobicity of 0.2 independent of the cutoff length, whereas the range of the hydrophobicity determined for the detected peptides covered a range from –2 to 0.5, with two exceptions where the peptides revealed hydrophobicity values of 2.0 and 1.1. In contrast, the non-detected peptides revealed a high hydrophobicity (Fig. 1C, bars 1 and 3). Furthermore, peptides not detected and longer than 21 amino acids exceeded the hydrophobicity index of shorter peptides of the same pool by a factor of ∼4. These two observations point to the interpretation that the hydrophobicity and the length of peptides are critical determinants for detection by experimental means. Comparison of the Thylakoid and the A. thaliana Proteome— From the analysis of the experimental data obtained from sequencing of the thylakoid membrane, it was determined that longer and more hydrophobic peptides are not as frequently detected compared with shorter and more hydrophilic peptides (Fig. 1B). We therefore addressed the specific role of peptide length in the increase in the hydrophobicity index. To answer this question, the proteome of the thylakoids was digested in silico at trypsin-specific cleavage sites, and the hydrophobicity and the number of fragments were calculated for each pool of peptides of a defined length (Fig. 2). Strikingly, the pools of peptides shorter than 20 amino acids showed a hydrophilic behavior in general, whereas the pools of longer peptides revealed a general hydrophobic character. To exclude that this observation is limited to the proteins of the thylakoid membrane, we analyzed the entire A. thaliana proteome. As expected, the number of peptides in a certain pool size decreased exponentially with the length of the peptides (Fig. 3A). Next, we analyzed the β-barrel probability and the hydrophobicity of each peptide pool (Fig. 3, B and C). The probability for a membrane-inserted β-sheet was found to be very low. Only the pools with a peptide size above 50 amino acids in length revealed a score above zero. For comparison, a cutoff score of 2 was chosen for selection as a membrane-inserted β-sheet (34Schleiff E. Eichacker L.A. Eckart K. Becker T. Mirus O. Stahl T. Soll J. Protein Sci. 2003; 12: 748-759Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 41Wimley W.C. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 301-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). However, it is worthwhile to mention that the exact β-strand score of the pools increased almost linearly with the peptide size of the pools (Fig. 3B). This might suggest that the portion of peptides derived from membrane-inserted β-barrels increases in the pools of peptide of increasing size. As seen before for the thylakoid proteins, the average hydrophobicity of the A. thaliana proteome fragments increased almost linearly in the peptide size range of up to 30 amino acids (Fig. 3C). The pools of peptides longer than 20 amino acids showed a mean hydrophobic character, whereas the pools of peptides shorter than 21 amino acids revealed an overall hydrophilic character. Therefore, the observation made for the thylakoid proteins can be generalized for the whole proteome. Peptides longer than 20 amino acids are more hydrophobic in general, indicating that hydrophobicity is a major determinant for detection by mass spectrometry.Fig. 3Statistical analysis of an in silico tryptic digest from the A. thaliana genome.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Grx1 and Grx2 are cytosolic dithiol glutaredoxins, whereas Grx3, Grx4, and Grx5 are monothiol glutaredoxins. Grx5 locates at the mitochondrial matrix and is needed for iron/sulfur cluster biogenesis. Its absence causes phenotypes such as inactivation of iron/sulfur enzymes and sensitivity to oxidative stress.

We have addressed the functional divergence among glutaredoxins by targeting Grx2/3/4 molecules to the mitochondrial matrix using the Grx5 targeting sequence. The mitochondrial forms of Grx3 and Grx4 partially rescue the defects of a grx5 null mutant. On the contrary, mitochondrially targeted Grx2 does not suppress the mutant phenotype. Both the thioredoxin-like and glutaredoxin domains are needed for the mitochondrial activity of Grx3, although none of the cysteine residues at the thioredoxin-like domain is required for rescue of the grx5 phenotypes.

They reduce protein disulfides through a dithiol mechanism that involves two cysteine residues in the active site of the glutaredoxin molecule, or they deglutathionylate GSH-protein mixed disulfides through a monothiol mechanism of action involving a single cysteine at the active site (2Fernandes A.P.

Besides glutaredoxins and GSH, the glutaredoxin system also includes glutaredoxin reductases that regenerate GSH from glutathione disulfide. Glutaredoxins have a number of biological roles.

Glutaredoxins play an important role in protecting against protein oxidative damage by regulating the glutathionylated state of essential sulfhydryl groups (12Cotgreave I.A. Gerdes R.G. Biochem.

In human cells, Grx1 glutaredoxin is cytosolic (13Padilla C.A. Martínez-Galisteo E. Bárcena J.A. Spyrou G. Holmgren A. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 227: 27-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), whereas a second glutaredoxin (Grx2) has two isoforms that are, respectively, located at the nucleus and the mitochondria (14Gladyshev V.N.

In plants, glutaredoxins have also been described at the cytosol and mitochondria (16Rouhier N. Gelhaye E. Jacquot J.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2002; 973: 520-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The existence of cross-talk between the glutaredoxin and thioredoxin systems is illustrated by the fact that human Grx2 is able to deglutathionylate GSH-protein mixed disulfides through thioredoxin reductase as an alternative to GSH (17Johansson C. Lillig C.H. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7537-7543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar).

EMBO Rep. 2003; 4: 184-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae contains two glutaredoxins (Grx1 and Grx2) with conserved CPYC motifs in their active sites (24Luikenhuis S. Perrone G. Dawes I.W. Grant C.M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 1081-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Both are cytosolic, though a minor fraction of Grx2 molecules is located at the mitochondria (25Pedrajas J.R. Porras P. Martínez-Galisteo E. Padilla C.A. Miranda-Vizuete A. Bárcena J.A. Biochem.

Chem. 2004; 279: 7785-7791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In addition to the dithiol glutaredoxins, S. cerevisiae cells contain three monothiol glutaredoxins (Grx3, Grx4, and Grx5) with the motif CGFS in their active sites (27Rodríguez-Manzaneque M.T.

Grx5 is located at the mitochondrial matrix and participates in the biogenesis of iron/sulfur (Fe/S) clusters (29Rodríguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Bellí G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 30Mühlenhoff U. Gerber J. Lill R. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 4815-4825Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). The absence of Grx5 causes the inactivation of enzymes containing Fe/S clusters, intracellular iron accumulation, hypersensitivity to external oxidants, high levels of protein oxidation, auxotrophy for a number of amino acids, and low growth rates in rich medium (27Rodríguez-Manzaneque M.T.

Grant C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 16853-16859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). All of these phenotypes are probably a consequence of disruption of the Grx5 function in the biogenesis of Fe/S clusters because most of the alterations are shared by other mutants affected in the biogenesis of the clusters (32Lill R.

Grx3 and Grx4 molecules are larger than Grx5 because they contain a thioredoxin-like domain that is N-terminal located relative to the glutaredoxin domain, with a linking region between the two domains (28Bellí G. Polaina J. Tamarit J. de la Torre M.A. Rodríguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Herrero E. J. Biol.

Yeast monothiol glutaredoxins are members of a large group of proteins present in organisms ranging from bacteria to higher eukaryotes (28Bellí G. Polaina J.

The human member is the PICOT protein, a negative regulator of protein kinase θ in the pathway that controls c-Jun N-terminal kinase (36Witte S. Villalba M. Bi K. Liu Y. Isakov N. Altman A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 1902-1909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This translocates from the cytosol to the nucleus in response to oxidative stress (37Babichev Y. Isakov N. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 2001; 495: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The mouse PICOT homologue is differentially expressed at stages of mouse embryogenesis concomitant with neural tube closure (38Greene N.D.E. Leung K.Y. Wait R. Begum S. Dunn M.J. Copp A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41645-41651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Some functional interactions may exist between monothiol and dithiol glutaredoxins in S. cerevisiae. However, they do not fully substitute each other because the overexpression of Grx3 or Grx4 does not rescue the above defects of grx5 cells (29Rodríguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Bellí G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that Grx4 is located at the nucleus and that it interacts with the Bud32 protein kinase (39Lopreiato R. Facchin S. Sartori G. Arrigoni G. Casonato S. Ruzzene M. Pinna L.A. Carignani G. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In the current work we have demonstrated that Grx3 is also located at the nucleus and that its thioredoxin-like domain is required for nuclear targeting. We have also shown that when either Grx3 or Grx4 are targeted to the mitochondria they can substitute for Grx5 function, unlike dithiol glutaredoxins. Therefore, differential compartmentalization determines separate biological functions for the members of the monothiol glutaredoxin family. Yeast Strains and Plasmids—The yeast strains employed in this work are described in Table I. Plasmid pMM221 was based on the LEU2 integrative vector YIplac128 (40Gietz R.D. Sugino A. Gene. 1988; 74: 3065-3073Google Scholar), with the doxycycline-controlled tTA transactivator and tetO2 promoter regions from pCM188 (41Garí E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar), the mitochondrial targeting sequence of GRX5 from pCM318 (29Rodríguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Bellí G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar), and the 3HA/His6 tag from pCM265 (42Arino J. Herrero E. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 366: 347-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), plus a polylinker created with adequate complementary oligonucleotides. Plasmid pMM225 contains the GRX2 coding sequence from the nucleotide at position +103 to the last coding nucleotide, which is in-frame with the 3HA/His6 tag. It was cloned between the NotI and PstI sites of the vector pMM221. Similarly, plasmids pMM227 and pMM229, respectively, contain the GRX3 and GRX4 coding sequences from the second to the last coding codon, cloned between the NotI and PstI sites of pMM221. Plasmids pMM338, pMM340, and pMM342 derive from pMM221 by, respectively, cloning the sequences of GRX3 coding from amino acid 2 to 133 (including the Trx domain), 2 to 198 (Trx domain plus linker), or 199 to 285 (Grx domain) between the NotI and PstI sites of the vector. pMM344, pMM349, pMM387, and pMM451 are pMM227 derivatives with the following respective point mutations in the Grx3 sequence: C72S, C211S, C2S, and C18A. Plasmid pMM453 also derives from pMM227 and contains the three point mutations C2S, C18A, C72S in the coding sequence for Grx3. GFP fusions to different regions of Grx3 were constructed under the control of the MET25 promoter in pUG35 (from W. H. Hegemann, Institute of Microbiology, Duesseldorf, Germany), using the EcoRI and HindIII vector sites. pMM423 and pMM421, respectively, contain the GRX3 coding sequences from amino acid 1 to 133 and 199 to 285, in-frame with the GFP sequence at the C terminus. Plasmid pMM425 is a pUG35 derivative with the whole GRX3 sequence C-terminal tagged with GFP.Table IStrains employed in this workStrainRelevant phenotypeCommentsW303-1AMATa ura3-1 ade2-1 leu2-3, 112 trp1-1 his3-11, 15Wild typeW303-1BAs W303-1A but MATaWild typeMML100MATa grx5::kanMX4Ref. 29Rodríguez-Manzaneque M.T.

YPGly and YPGal media are similar to YPD except that they, respectively, contain 3% glycerol and 2% galactose instead of dextrose. Synthetic S.D. medium contains 0.67% yeast nitrogen base, 2% glucose, and the auxotrophic requirements. Doxycycline was added to the medium at the indicated concentrations to modulate expression from the tetO2 promoter. Cells were exponentially grown at 30 °C under the required conditions for at least 10 generations before samples were taken for analysis. Genetic Methods—Standard methods were employed for DNA manipulation, transformation, crosses between yeast strains, and tetrad analyses. PCR-amplified S. cerevisiae genomic DNA was used for cloning with appropriate oligonucleotides for amplification that created the required restriction sites. Point mutants to yield the different amino acid replacements were constructed by the ExSite method (43Weiner M.P. Costa G.L. Dieffenbach C.W. Dveksler G.S. PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 613-621Google Scholar). In this case, oligonucleotides for PCR amplifications were designed in such a way that a restriction site not altering the translation product was introduced as a marker near the desired point mutation. Introduction of the mutations was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Integrative plasmids were made linear by EcoRV digestion before transformation of the wild type cells to yield the respective derivatives. Other Methods—Mitochondria were purified and fractionated from cell cultures in lactate medium as described in Ref. 44Diekert K. de Kroon A.I.P.M. Kispal G. Lill R.

The Thioredoxin-like Domain of Grx3 Is Required for Targeting the Protein to the Nucleus—The three monothiol glutaredoxins of S. cerevisiae share a Grx domain that displays partial homology with dithiol glutaredoxins and contains the single cysteine active site (27Rodríguez-Manzaneque M.T.

This conserved domain has also been termed PICOT after its presence in the human PICOT protein (34Vilella F. Alves R Rodríguez-Manzaneque M.T. Bellí G. Swaminathan S. Sunnerhagen P. Herrero E. Comp. Funct. Genom. 2004; 5: 328-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In addition, Grx3 and Grx4 contain an N-terminal extension that is highly homologous to thioredoxin sequences (Trx domain in Fig. 1A). This domain is not present in Grx5, which instead contains a mitochondrial targeting sequence (29Rodríguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Bellí G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). The Trx domain contains a WAD/EPCK sequence that is reminiscent of the authentic thioredoxin active site motif WCGPCK (47Powis G. Montfort W.R. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 261-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). The Trx domain is conserved in many members of the Grx3/Grx4 protein family in other eukaryotic organisms (28Bellí G. Polaina J. Tamarit J. de la Torre M.A. Rodríguez-Manzaneque M.T. Ros J. Herrero E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 37590-37596Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 35Isakov N. Witte S. Altman A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 537-539Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A non-conserved linker region is present between the Trx and Grx domains (Fig. 1A). It has recently been shown that Grx4 is located at the nucleus (39Lopreiato R. Facchin S. Sartori G. Arrigoni G. Casonato S. Ruzzene M. Pinna L.A. Carignani G. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 395-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Using a C terminus GFP-tagged construction under the control of the MET25 promoter, we have observed that Grx3 is also targeted to the nucleus in conditions of maximum expression from the promoter (Fig. 1B). When the expression level of the Grx3·GFP fusion protein was reduced by adding intermediate methionine concentrations (up to 25 μm) to the growth medium, Grx3 was still concentrated at the nucleus (not shown), discarding any possible abnormal location caused by overexpression. We concluded that Grx3 and Grx4 are both nuclear glutaredoxins, which suggests that their functions could be redundant. To determine the region of Grx3 responsible for its nuclear localization, the Trx and Grx domains were separately tagged with GFP in the same MET25-based vector as above. Cells expressing the Trx·GFP construction showed a nuclear fluorescence pattern, whereas those with the Grx·GFP construction showed diffuse fluorescence (Fig. 1B). This indicates that the Trx domain (but not the Grx domain) contains a nuclear location signal for Grx3 and is able to be directed to the nucleus on its own. Analysis of the Trx region amino acid sequence did not reveal either a simple or bipartite canonical nuclear localization signal (48Mattaj I.W. Englmeier L. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 265-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). We addressed the possibility of Grx3 location being regulated by external stresses in a similar way to the external conditions-controlled nuclear location of several transcription factors that mediate stress responses (Msn2/4, Yap1, Aft1) (19Toledano M.B. Delaunay A. Biteau B. Spector D. Azevedo D. Hohmann S. Mager P.W.H. Topics in Current Genetics. 1. Springer-Verlag, Berlin2003: 241-303Google Scholar, 49Estruch F. FEMS Microbiol.

Chem. 2002; 21: 18914-18918Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, neither heat shock, hydrogen peroxide-mediated oxidative stress, nor entry into the post-diauxic stage of the growth curve affected the nuclear location of Grx3 (Fig. 1C). We have therefore concluded that Grx3 has a constitutive nuclear location. Grx3 and Grx4, but Not Grx2, Rescue the Defects of Cells Lacking Grx5—The fact that overexpression of native Grx3 or Grx4 glutaredoxins does not rescue the defects of a null Δgrx5 mutant (29Rodríguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Bellí G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar) could be a consequence of their different cellular compartmentalizations with respect to Grx5. We wondered what would happen in a situation in which Grx3 or Grx4 was targeted to the mitochondria in the absence of Grx5. We were also interested in determining the ability of a mitochondrially targeted form of the dithiol glutaredoxin Grx2 to substitute for Grx5 function when overexpressed. Grx2 is mostly located at the cytosol, although a minor fraction could be mitochondrial (25Pedrajas J.R. Porras P. Martínez-Galisteo E. Padilla C.A. Miranda-Vizuete A. Bárcena J.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 617-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With this objective, we constructed a vector (Fig. 2A) in which the desired gene was fused to the coding sequence of the mitochondria targeting signal of the Grx5 protein. In this vector (pMM221), expression of the HA-tagged chimeric protein was controlled by a tetO2 promoter that also made it possible to modulate its expression according to doxycycline concentration. pMM221 was employed to clone the GRX2, GRX3, and GRX4 sequences. In the case of GRX2, the sequence cloned began at the codon coding for methionine at position 35 in the open reading frame. In other words, the resulting construct consisted of the Grx5 mitochondrial targeting sequence fused to the Grx2 form that predominantly compartmentalizes at the cytosol (25Pedrajas J.R. Porras P. Martínez-Galisteo E. Padilla C.A. Miranda-Vizuete A. Bárcena J.A. Biochem. J. 2002; 364: 617-623Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the two monothiol glutaredoxin genes, the initial ATG codons in the respective open reading frames were omitted in the pMM221-based constructions. Yeast cells transformed with either of the respective constructions in the pMM221 vector were able to direct Grx2, Grx3, or Grx4 to the mitochondria. When identical amounts of total mitochondrial protein were analyzed from cultures grown in the absence of doxycycline, the levels of the HA-tagged forms of the above glutaredoxins were considerably higher than the level of endogenous Grx5-HA (Fig. 2B). This confirmed that tetO2 is a strong promoter (41Garí E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar) and is responsible for protein overexpression even when it is present in a single copy integrative plasmid such as pMM221. Importantly, all the mitochondrial glutaredoxin molecules were compartmentalized at the matrix, as occurs with Grx5 (Fig. 2B and Ref. 29Rodríguez-Manzaneque M.T. Tamarit J. Bellí G. Ros J. Herrero E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2002; 13: 1109-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). This compartmentalization pattern was the same as that of the matrix lipoic-containing protein α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. The respective mobilities of the Grx-HA bands in the mitochondrial fraction corresponded to the expected sizes of the mature proteins once the Grx5 targeting sequence had been processed. In some cases, a lower mobility band was present in minor amounts in the total extract fraction (Fig. 2B); this probably corresponded to the non-processed precursor form of the mitochondrial molecules.

https://openalex.org/W2100876843,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive and ultimately fatal skeletal muscle disease. Currently, the most effective therapy is the administration of a subclass of glucocorticoids, most notably deflazacort. Although deflazacort treatment can attenuate DMD progression, extend ambulation, and maintain muscle strength, the mechanism of its action remains unknown. Prior observations have shown that activation of a JNK1-mediated signal transduction cascade contributes to the progression of the DMD phenotype, in part by phosphorylation and inhibition of a calcineurin sensitive NF-ATc1 transcription factor. Here, we observed that deflazacort treatment restored myocyte viability in muscle cells with constitutive activation of JNK1 and in dystrophic mdx mice. However, deflazacort treatment did not alter JNK1 activity itself, but rather led to an increase in the activity of the calcineurin phosphatase and an up-regulation of NF-ATc1-dependent gene expression. The prophylactic effect of deflazacort treatment was associated with increased expression of NF-ATc1 target genes such as the dystrophin homologue utrophin. Moreover, the muscle sparing effects of deflazacort were completely abolished when used in conjunction with the calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporine. Collectively, these results show that deflazacort attenuates loss of dystrophic myofiber integrity by up-regulating the activity of the phosphatase calcineurin, which in turn negates JNK1 inhibition of NF-ATc1-mediated phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of NF-ATc1."

Moreover, silencing of Syt VII-GFP with specific small interfering RNA dramatically reduced high KCl-dependent neuropeptide Y secretion from the stable PC12 cell line (∼60% of the control cells), whereas the same small interfering RNA had little effect on neuropeptide Y secretion from the wild-type PC12 cells (∼85–90% of the control cells), indicating that the level of endogenous expression of Syt VII molecules must be low.

Although Syt VII has also been suggested as a regulator of secretory vesicle exocytosis in some endocrine cells and in neurons, the precise subcellular localization, expression level, and function of Syt VII are still matters of controversy (36Gao Z.

They also showed that Syt VII is abundantly and endogenously expressed in PC12 cells (43Han W. Rhee J.S. Maximov A. Lao Y. Mashimo T. Rosenmund C. Südhof T.C. Neuron. 2004; 41: 85-99Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Contradictory results, however, have been reported by other groups. First, there is a report that the level of endogenous expression of Syt VII in PC12 cells must be very low (less than 3% of Syt I) based on a quantitative immunoblot analysis (13Tucker W.C.

Ogata Y. Saegusa C. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Such discrepancies are most likely attributable to the transfection methods used (transient expression versus stable expression), and transient overexpression of recombinant Syt proteins actually often causes mislocalization or aggregation of Syt proteins in living cells (40Fukuda M. Ogata Y. Saegusa C. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 44Fukuda M. Yamamoto A. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol.

In this study we established a PC12 cell line that stably expresses Syt VII-GFP molecules and analyzed its precise subcellular localization by immunocytochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy. Unlike the previous transient overexpression studies, the Syt VII-GFP molecules were mainly targeted to dense-core vesicles that undergo Ca2+-dependent exocytosis and to other intracellular compartments such as the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and lysosomes. We also found that the selective knockdown of Syt VII-GFP by means of recently developed RNAi (double-stranded RNA-mediated interference) technology (reviewed in Refs. 46Moss E.G. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R772-R775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar and 47McManus M.T. Sharp P.A. Nat. Rev. Genet. 2002; 3: 737-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (1215) Google Scholar) causes inhibition of dense-core vesicle exocytosis in the stable PC12 cell line. Based on our findings, we propose that the Syt VII molecule is mainly targeted to dense-core vesicles and functions as a “vesicular Ca2+ sensor” in endocrine cells.

Neurochem. 2000; 74: 518-526Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). To label lysosomes in vivo, the cells were incubated with 0.5 mg/ml Texas Red-labeled dextran (10,000 MW) in culture medium for 3 h. After the cells were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline, they were further incubated with culture medium without dextran for 3 h as described previously (32Martinez I. Chakrabarti S. Hellevik T. Morehead J. Fowler K. Andrews N.W. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 148: 1141-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer for 20 min at room temperature, permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 min, and incubated with the blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% Triton X-100 in phosphate-buffered saline) for 1 h at room temperature as described previously (49Ibata K.

Next, the cells were incubated with one of the following primary antibodies, anti-Syt IV rabbit polyclonal antibody (5 μg/ml), anti-Syt I (1/250 dilution), anti-Syt IX (1/100 dilution), anti-Rab3A (1/500 dilution), anti-transferrin receptor (1/100 dilution), anti-GM130 (1/100 dilution), anti-TGN38 (1/500 dilution), anti-BiP (1/200 dilution), or anti-EEA1 mouse monoclonal antibody (1/100 dilution). After washing the cells with the blocking solution, they were incubated with the following secondary antibodies, Alexa Fluor 568-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (1/5000 dilution) or Alexa Fluor 568-labeled anti-mouse IgG (1/5000 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then examined with a confocal fluorescence microscope (Fluoview, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), and the images were processed with Adobe Photoshop software (version 7.0). The immunoelectron microscopic analysis of Syt VII-GFP molecule was essentially performed with anti-GFP rabbit polyclonal antibody (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.) as described previously (50Fukuda M.

The cells were immediately washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde as described above. Incorporated anti-FLAG tag mouse antibody and anti-Syt IX-N rabbit antibody were separately visualized with Alexa Fluor 568-labeled anti-rabbit and Alexa Fluor 633-labeled anti-rabbit IgGs (1/5000 dilution), respectively, and then analyzed with a confocal fluorescence microscope as described above. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Wild-type or Syt VII-GFP-expressing PC12 cells (two confluent 10-cm dishes) were homogenized in a buffer containing 1 μl of 50 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, and protease inhibitors (0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, and 10 μm pepstatin A) in a glass-Teflon Potter homogenizer with 10 strokes at 900–1000 rpm, and the proteins were solubilized with 1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 1 h. After removing the insoluble material by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant (400 μl) was incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel in the presence of 1 mm CaCl2 (or 2 mm EGTA) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed five times with 10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100, 1 mm CaCl2 (or 2 mm EGTA), and protease inhibitors, and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to a 10% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with anti-Syt I (1/250 dilution), anti-Syt IV (0.9 μg/ml), anti-Syt IX (1/250 dilution), or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-FLAG tag mouse monoclonal antibody (1/10,000 dilution) as described previously (53Fukuda M. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31421-31427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Immunoreactive bands were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). The blots shown in this paper are representative of three independent experiments. Construction of pSilencer-Syt VII Vectors for Syt VII Silencing and Neuropeptide Y (NPY) Release Assay—To silence rat and mouse Syt VII, a 19-nucleotide sequence (TCATCACCGTCAGCCTTAG) was selected according to the manufacturer's notes (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX). The specificity of the sequence was verified by a BLAST search of the public data bases. pSilencer™ 1.0-U6 expression vectors (Ambion) that produce small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeted against Syt VII (named pSilencer-Syt VII) were also prepared according to the manufacturer's notes (29Fukuda M. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 875-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In brief, two oligonucleotides (sense, 5′-TCATCACCGTCAGCCTTAGTTCAAGAGACTAAGGCTGACGGTGATGATTTTTT-3′ and antisense, 5′-AATTAAAAAATCATCACCGTCAGCCTTAGTCTCTTGAACTAAGGCTGACGGTGATGAGGCC-3′; the underlined sequences contribute to forming small hairpin RNAs) were synthesized chemically, and the annealed oligonucleotides encoding short hairpin RNA were then subcloned into the ApaI/EcoRI site of the pSilencer™ 1.0-U6 vector. The efficiency and specificity of the siRNA targeted against Syt VII were assessed by transfection of pSilencer vector into the PC12 cell line stably expressing Syt VII-GFP molecule (29Fukuda M.

Cotransfection of pShooter-NPY-T7-GST with pSilencer-Syt VII into PC12 cells and measurement of the NPY released with high (or low) KCl-stimulation for 20 min were performed as described previously (52Fukuda M.

Synaptotagmin VII-GFP in PC12 cells Is Predominantly Localized on the Dense-core Vesicles—Although several independent groups have recently proposed that Syt VII regulates Ca2+-dependent vesicle exocytosis, its precise subcellular localization (plasma membrane, secretory granules, or lysosomes) is a matter of controversy (32Martinez I.

Because most previous studies on the function of Syt VII used transiently overexpressed Syt VII molecules, it is highly possible that excess recombinant Syt VII protein is mistargeted to other intracellular compartments by overflowing the normal transport pathway. To investigate this possibility, we established a PC12 cell line that stably expresses FLAG-Syt VII-GFP molecules (40Fukuda M. Ogata Y. Saegusa C. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We then selected three independent cell lines and found that they exhibited the same intracellular distribution of Syt VII-GFP (Figs. 1 and 4, A). The GFP fluorescence was found to be located in at least three distinct intracellular compartments of the PC12 cell line, the tips of the cellular processes (where dense-core vesicles are accumulated), the perinuclear regions, and adjacent to the plasma membrane. No GFP fluorescence was found around the plasma membrane when the stable cells were first established (40Fukuda M. Ogata Y. Saegusa C. Kanno E. Mikoshiba K. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), but it became evident after several passages of the cells. In the first set of experiments, we investigated whether Syt VII-GFP was localized on the dense-core vesicles in the PC12 cell line by making comparisons with several dense-core vesicle markers at the immunocytochemical level. As shown in Fig. 1, Syt VII-GFP overlapped well with three dense-core vesicle markers (Fig. 1, C, F, and L, yellow, Syt I, Syt IX, and Rab3A, respectively) in the cellular processes, but not with Syt IV (Fig. 1I), which is not present on dense-core vesicles in undifferentiated PC12 cells (50Fukuda M.

Biochem. 2004; 136: 245-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Syt VII-GFP was clearly associated with both Syts I and IX, but not with Syt IV, and the interaction between Syt VII-GFP and Syt IX was enhanced by Ca2+ (Fig. 2, compare lanes 3 and 4, third panel), consistent with the results of previous in vitro binding experiments (55Fukuda M.

https://openalex.org/W2055983893,"Mus musculus Pax2 transactivation domain-interacting protein (Ptip) is an essential gene required for the maintenance of genome stability, although its precise molecular role is unclear. Human PTIP (hPTIP) was recently isolated in a screen for proteins, translated from cDNA pools, capable of interacting with peptides phosphorylated by the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated)/ATR (ataxia telangiectasia-related) protein kinases. hPTIP was described as a 757-amino acid protein bearing four BRCT domains. Here we report that instead full-length endogenous hPTIP contains 1069 amino acids and six BRCT domains. hPTIP shows increased association with 53BP1 in response to ionizing radiation (IR) but not in response to other DNA-damaging agents. Whereas translocation of both 53BP1 and hPTIP to sites of IR-induced DNA damage occurs independently of ATM, IR-induced association of PTIP and 53BP1 requires ATM. Deletion analysis identified the domains of 53BP1 and hPTIP required for protein-protein interaction and focus formation. Data characterizing the cellular roles of hPTIP are also presented. Small interfering RNA was used to show that hPTIP is required for ATM-mediated phosphorylation of p53 at Ser(15) and for IR-induced up-regulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21. Lowering hPTIP levels also increased cellular sensitivity to IR, suggesting that this protein plays a critical role in maintaining genome stability."
https://openalex.org/W2053167155,"For proper development and tissue homeostasis, cell cycle progression is controlled by multilayered mechanisms. Recent studies using knock-out mice have shown that animals can develop relatively normally with deficiency for each of the G1/S-regulatory proteins, D-type and E-type cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4), and Cdk2. Although Cdk4-null mice show no embryonic lethality, they exhibit specific endocrine phenotypes, i.e. dwarfism, infertility, and diabetes. Here we have demonstrated that Cdk4 plays an essential non-redundant role in postnatal proliferation of the anterior pituitary. Pituitaries from wild-type and Cdk4-null embryos at embryonic day 17.5 are morphologically indistinguishable with similar numbers of cells expressing a proliferating marker, Ki67, and cells expressing a differentiation marker, growth hormone. In contrast, anterior pituitaries of Cdk4-null mice at postnatal 8 weeks are extremely hypoplastic with markedly decreased numbers of Ki67+ cells, suggesting impaired cell proliferation. Pituitary hyperplasia induced by transgenic expression of human growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) is significantly diminished in the Cdk4+/– genetic background and completely abrogated in the Cdk4–/– background. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of Cdk4 inhibits GHRH-induced proliferation of GH3 somato/lactotroph cells with restored expression of GHRH receptors. Cdk4 siRNA also inhibits estrogen-dependent cell proliferation in GH3 cells and closely related GH4 cells. In contrast, Cdk6 siRNA does not diminish proliferation of these cells. Furthermore, Cdk4 siRNA does not affect GHRH-induced proliferation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts or estrogen-dependent proliferation of mammary carcinoma MCF-7 cells. Taken together, Cdk4 is dispensable for prenatal development of the pituitary or proliferation of other non-endocrine tissues but indispensable specifically for postnatal proliferation of somato/lactotrophs.

Cell. 2004; 116: 235-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (774) Google Scholar). In complex with D-type cyclins, Cdk4 phosphorylates G1-specific substrates, including the retinoblastoma protein (Rb). Unphosphorylated or hypophosphorylated forms of Rb participate in transcriptional repressor complexes with E2F-1–3. Rb phosphorylation in collaboration with cyclin D/Cdk4 (or closely related Cdk6) and cyclin E/Cdk2 results in release of Rb from the E2F complex, leading to transactivation of the E2F target genes important for the S-phase, e.g. cyclins E and A, dihydrofolate reductase and DNA polymerase-α (3Stevaux O. Dyson N.J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Furthermore, several Cdk inhibitor proteins, including p16INK4a, p27Kip1, and p21Cip1/Waf1, play roles in coordinating temporal activation of Cdk4 and Cdk2 by D-type and E-type cyclins, respectively (4Sherr C.J. Roberts J.M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1501-1512Crossref PubMed Scopus (5130) Google Scholar). The multilayered G1-Cdk regulation ensures proper control of proliferation, as well as timely transition between proliferation and quiescence, and should be crucial for development and function of every tissue. Two groups, including ours, recently demonstrated that Cdk4-deficient mice survive embryogenesis, suggesting that Cdk4 is dispensable for embryonic development (5Tsutsui T. Hesabi B. Moons D.S.

Barbacid M. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 44-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar). Consistently, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) prepared from Cdk4-null E12.5 embryos proliferate normally, with the exception of a modest delay in cell cycle entry from serum deprivation-induced quiescence. These data suggest that some other genes, possibly Cdk6 and Cdk2, may compensate for Cdk4 deficiency. However, studies on postnatal Cdk4-null mice (5Tsutsui T. Hesabi B. Moons D.S. Pandolfi P.P. Hansel K.S. Koff A. Kiyokawa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7011-7019Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar, 6Rane S.G. Dubus P. Mettus R.V. Galbreath E.J. Boden G. Reddy E.P. Barbacid M. Nat. Genet. 1999; 22: 44-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (610) Google Scholar) unraveled unique phenotypes: 1) spontaneous degeneration of the pancreatic β cells, first detectable at several weeks of age, resulting in insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus; 2) postnatal growth retardation; and 3) infertility in both females and males. Cdk4–/– male mice display severe testicular atrophy with a meiotic defect, whereas females exhibit normal ovulation and fertilization but fail implantation with complete sterility (7Moons D.S. Jirawatnotai S. Tsutsui T. Franks R. Parlow A.F. Hales D.B. Gibori G. Fazleabas A.T. Kiyokawa H. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Our data indicated that prolactin deficiency in Cdk4–/– female mice, associated with pituitary hypoplasia, plays a major role in the sterility phenotype (7Moons D.S. Jirawatnotai S. Tsutsui T. Franks R. Parlow A.F. Hales D.B. Gibori G. Fazleabas A.T. Kiyokawa H. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 647-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 8Moons D.S. Jirawatnotai S. Parlow A.F. Gibori G. Kineman R.D. Kiyokawa H. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3001-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, Cdk4 is required for homeostasis of particular endocrine tissues such as the pancreatic islet and pituitary even though Cdk4 is expressed ubiquitously. Studies on other knock-out mice deficient in the G1 control pathways also suggest that the pituitary gland is extremely sensitive to perturbation of G1 regulation. Mice heterozygous for Rb deletion develop pituitary tumors originating from the melanotrophs in the intermediate lobe (9Hu N. Gutsmann A. Herbert D.C. Bradley A. Lee W.H. Lee E.Y. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 1021-1027PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, mice deficient for p27Kip1 or p18INK4c also develop melanotroph adenomas (reviewed in Ref. 10Vidal A. Koff A. Gene. 2000; 247: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Interestingly, double deficiency for p27Kip1 and p18INK4c or Rb results in more aggressive pituitary tumors, suggesting genetic cooperation. Thus, proper control of the Cdk/Rb-dependent G1 regulatory pathway seems to be critical for homeostasis and tumor suppression in the pituitary gland, although the mechanism of this unique tissue specificity remains to be defined. Here we have reported that Cdk4 is required specifically for hormonally regulated proliferation of somatotrophs and lactotrophs in postnatal pituitary glands, whereas Cdk4 is dispensable in embryonic development of the pituitary. Together with the requirement of Cdk4 for maintenance of postnatal pancreatic β cells (11Martin J. Hunt S.L. Dubus P. Sotillo R. Nehme-Pelluard F. Magnuson M.A. Parlow A.F. Malumbres M. Ortega S.

Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8413-8421Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), the data suggest a unique nature of cell cycle control in particular endocrine tissues. Animals—Cdk4-deficient mice and transgenic mice expressing hGHRH (MT-hGHRH) were described previously (5Tsutsui T. Hesabi B. Moons D.S. Pandolfi P.P. Hansel K.S. Koff A. Kiyokawa H. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1985; 315: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Mice were cross-bred under a 13-h light, 11-h dark cycle and fed ad libitum with a pelleted diet. To isolate E17.5 pituitaries, embryos were obtained from Cdk4+/– females at day 17.5 p.c. MEFs were prepared from day 12.5 mouse embryos as described previously (5Tsutsui T. Hesabi B. Moons D.S. Pandolfi P.P. Hansel K.S. Koff A. Kiyokawa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7011-7019Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Cell Culture—GH3 and GH4 cell lines were a gift from Drs. Eun Jig Lee and J. Larry Jameson, Northwestern Medical School. MCF-7 cells were a gift from Dr. William T. Beck, University of Illinois at Chicago. GH3 and GH4 cell lines were cultured in 1:1 DMEM/Ham's F12 (Cambrex, Walkersville, MD) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma) and penicillin/streptomycin. MCF-7 cells and MEFs were cultured in DMEM, supplemented with 10% FBS, and penicillin/streptomycin. Immunohistochemistry—Pituitary tissues were processed and sectioned with 5 μm thickness according to a standard protocol. The sections were dewaxed in Safeclear II (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) and rehydrated in a series of decreasing concentrations of ethanol. Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched by immersing slides in 0.3% H2O2 in deionized H2O for 30 min. Slides were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, pH7.4, containing 0.01% Triton X-100 or boiled 10 min in 10 mm pH 6.0 sodium citrate for Ki67 staining. The sections were then treated for 30 min with 1.5% normal goat serum and incubated for 2 h with monkey anti-GH antibody (14Teixeira L.T. Kiyokawa H. Peng X.D. Christov K.T. Frohman L.A. Kineman R.D. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 1875-1884Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) at a dilution of 1:100,000 or with mouse anti-Ki67 antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) at 1:1,000. Slides were then rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline/Triton and incubated for 30 min with biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories) at a dilution of 1:200, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, and incubated in avidin-peroxidase conjugate (Elite Vectastain; Vector Laboratories). The color reaction was developed using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine for 2 min. The sections were then subjected to counterstaining with Nuclear Fast Red (Vector Laboratories) or hematoxylin-eosin. Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) and Cell Proliferation Assay—si-RNAs that specifically target mouse/rat Cdk4, human Cdk4, and rat Cdk6 mRNAs were designed according to the manufacturer's protocol (Dharmacon Research, Lafayette, CO). The sense sequences correspond to residues 801–819 of the coding region of the rat Cdk4 mRNA, which are identical to the murine counterpart, residues 632–650 of the human Cdk4 mRNA, and residues 96–116 of the rat Cdk6 mRNA. At 24 h prior to siRNA transfection, cells were plated in 6-cm cell culture dishes that contain cover glasses (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) at the bottom. Cell lines were transfected twice, with a 24-h interval, with each of the specific siRNA or a pool of 4 nonspecific 21-mer double strand RNA control (Dharmacon) using Oligofectamine (Invitrogen). At 24 h post-transfection, bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) was added to the culture medium at a concentration of 5 μg/ml, followed by a 60-min incubation. BrdUrd incorporation was visualized by immunofluorescence using mouse anti-BrdUrd antibody (Roche Applied Science) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse antibody (Vector Laboratories). Percentages of BrdUrd+ cells were quantified in random fields (>300 total cells) of at least three different slides/treatment and subjected to statistical analyses. Adenovirus-mediated Expression of the Human GHRH Receptor— Generation and characterization of adenovirus encoding human GHRH receptor (Ad GHRH-R) were described previously (15Lee E.J. Duan W.R. Kotlar T. Jameson J.L. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). GH3 cells were plated in a 10-cm culture dish and starved in minimal medium (DMEM/F12 medium containing 10% charcoal/dextran-treated FBS (HyClone, Logan, UT)). 96 h later, cells were infected with the adenovirus at a dosage of 10 plaque-forming units/cell. Cells were incubated for 48 h for the expression of hGHRH-R before being replated in 6-cm culture dishes in the medium supplemented with or without GHRH (Sigma). Cdk4 siRNA knockdown and cell proliferation assay were performed 24 h later. MEF cells were cultured in DMEM + 10% FBS and infected with Ad GHRH-R. Cell numbers were determined 4 days after the treatments of 50 nm GHRH. Apoptosis Assay—Apoptotic cells were detected in paraffin-embedded sections by the terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay using the Apoptosis Detection System, Fluorescein (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Immunoblotting—The immunoblotting was performed as described previously (5Tsutsui T. Hesabi B. Moons D.S. Pandolfi P.P. Hansel K.S. Koff A. Kiyokawa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7011-7019Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Signals were quantified by Kodak 1D Image Analysis software. Anti-cyclin D1 (DCS-6), cyclin D2 (DCS-3.1 + DCS-5.2), cyclin D3 (DCS-22), and Cdk2 (2B6 + 8D4) were purchased from Lab Vision Inc., Fremont, CA. Anti-Cdk4(C-22) and Cdk6 (C-21) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA. Statistics—Data are described as means + S.E. The differences between groups were evaluated with Student's t test and analysis of variance with a significance level of p < 0.05. Cdk4 Is Dispensable for Prenatal Pituitary Development and Somatotroph Differentiation—Somatotrophs and lactotrophs of the pituitary in adult Cdk4–/– mice are severely hypoplastic, whereas gonadotrophs remain undisturbed (8Moons D.S. Jirawatnotai S. Parlow A.F. Gibori G. Kineman R.D. Kiyokawa H. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3001-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). However, small numbers of growth hormone (GH)- and prolactin-immunoreactive cells are present in Cdk4–/– pituitaries, suggesting that cell fate determination to the somato/lactotroph lineages is still functional in the absence of Cdk4. To examine whether Cdk4 deficiency affects embryonic development of the pituitary, we examined the morphology of pituitaries from Cdk4–/– and Cdk4+/+ embryos at day 17.5 post coitus (E17.5). We chose the developmental stage in which the lineage commitment of all anterior pituicytes is completed (16Cohen L.E. Endocrine. 2000; 12: 99-106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, at E17.5 the somatotroph population has yet to be fully expanded because the expression of the somatotroph-specific mitogen, growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), is not increased until a later stage of development (17Frohman L.A. Kineman R.D. Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2002; 13: 299-303Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 18Jansson J.O. Ishikawa K. Katakami H. Frohman L.A. Endocrinology. 1987; 120: 525-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Interestingly, transverse sections of heads demonstrated that pituitaries of Cdk4–/– embryos were morphologically indistinguishable from those of wild-type embryos (Fig. 1, A–F). Immunohistochemistry showed that GH expression was observed in similar numbers of cells in E17.5 Cdk4+/+ and Cdk4–/– anterior pituitaries, indicating that differentiation of the somatotroph lineage takes place normally at this developmental stage (Fig. 1, A–F). In addition, proliferation in E17.5 Cdk4–/– anterior pituitaries appeared intact. Immunohistochemistry for a proliferation marker, Ki67 (19Canavese G. Azzoni C. Pizzi S. Corleto V.D. Pasquali C. Davoli C. Crafa P. Delle F.G. Bordi C. Hum. Pathol. 2001; 32: 1094-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), showed similar degrees of proliferation in both E17.5 Cdk4+/+ and Cdk4–/– anterior pituitary (Fig. 1, G and H). Especially at the area of residual Rathke's pouch, similar numbers of cells displayed Ki67 immunoreactivity in wild-type and mutant pituitaries. These data indicate that Cdk4 is dispensable for pituitary morphogenesis up to E17.5 and for the commitment to the somatotroph lineage. Pituitary Cells in Cdk4–/– Mice Are Insensitive to Mitogenic Signals by a GHRH Transgene—The complex endocrine network involving the hypothalamus and target organs regulates the homeostasis of the postnatal pituitary (20Melmed S. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1603-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Hypoplastic changes of somatotrophs and lactotrophs observed in Cdk4–/– pituitaries could result from perturbation of mitogenic stimuli from the endocrine network, insensitivity of pituicytes to mitogenic signals, or both. To assess the mechanism, we examined effects of ectopic expression of GHRH upon pituitaries of Cdk4–/– mice. Cdk4-null mice were cross-bred with human GHRH transgenic mice under the control of the metallothionein-I promoter (MT-hGHRH) (13Hammer R.E. Brinster R.L. Rosenfeld M.G. Evans R.M. Mayo K.E. Nature. 1985; 315: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar); MT-hGHRH mice in Cdk4+/+, Cdk4 +/–, and Cdk4–/– genetic backgrounds were generated. A previous immunohistochemical study (21Brar A.K. Brinster R.L. Frohman L.A. Endocrinology. 1989; 125: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the MT promoter expresses hGHRH in most tissues, including the pituitary, pancreas, kidney, duodenum, lung, gonads, adrenal, heart, and brain. The pituitaries from 8-week-old Cdk4–/– females were extremely small, weighing about 30–40% of Cdk4+/+ pituitary weights (Fig. 2, A and B) as demonstrated previously (8Moons D.S. Jirawatnotai S. Parlow A.F. Gibori G. Kineman R.D. Kiyokawa H. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3001-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The MT-hGHRH transgene induced a significant increase in pituitary sizes and weights in Cdk4+/+ mice. Pituitaries of Cdk4+/– mice expressing the transgene displayed diminished hyperplastic responses, whereas Cdk4–/–;MT-hGHRH mice failed to show any significant response (Fig. 2, A and B). Histological analyses of Cdk4+/+;MT-GHRH mice revealed that major hyperplastic changes were within the anterior lobe, displaying increased numbers of GH-immunoreactive cells (Fig. 2, C and D). Counting monodispersed pituitary cells (Fig. 2E) showed that cell numbers of the somatotroph (GH+), lactotroph (PRL+), and thyrotroph (TSH+) in Cdk4+/+;MT-hGHRH mice were increased by more than 2-fold compared with wild-type mice without the transgene (Fig. 2E, Cdk4+/+). The MT-hGHRH transgene did not significantly increase numbers of lactotrophs, somatotrophs, or thyrotrophs in Cdk4–/– mice. To further address the mechanism of negative impact of Cdk4 deficiency on GHRH-induced hyperplasia, we examined proliferation and apoptosis in transgenic pituitaries by Ki67 immunohistochemistry and TUNEL assay, respectively. Pituitaries of MT-hGHRH;Cdk4+/+ mice at 8 weeks of age showed more proliferating (Ki67+) cells than those of Cdk4+/+ mice without the transgene (Fig. 3, A and B). In contrast, pituitaries of Cdk4–/– mice exhibited minimum numbers of Ki67+ cells regardless of the absence or presence of the transgene. Pituitaries of Cdk4+/+ and Cdk4–/– mice, with or without the MT-GHRH transgene, did not show any difference in apoptosis according to the TUNEL assay (data not shown). These data suggest that Cdk4 is essential and rate limiting for GHRH-induced proliferation in the postnatal pituitary.Fig. 3Impaired proliferation in Cdk4–/– pituitaries. A, Ki67 immunohistochemistry of paraffin-embedded anterior pituitary sections from 8-week-old Cdk4+/+, Cdk4–/–, Cdk4+/+;MT hGHRH, Cdk4–/–;MT hGHRH female mice.

To further examine the role of Cdk4 in proliferation of the somatotroph lineage in an environment without a complex endocrine network, we used rat somato/lactotroph GH3 cells. This immortalized cell line exhibits characteristics of both somatotroph and lactotroph and expresses detectable levels of GH and PRL, whereas it shows minimum expression of GHRH receptors (22Tashjian Jr., A.H. Yasumura Y. Levine L. Sato G.H. Parker M.L. Endocrinology. 1968; 82: 342-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar, 23Zeytin F.N. Gick G.G. Brazeau P. Ling N. McLaughlin M. Bancroft C. Endocrinology. 1984; 114: 2054-2059Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Thus, to study GHRH-mediated proliferation in vitro, we restored the expression of GHRH receptors in GH3 cells by Ad GHRH-R (15Lee E.J. Duan W.R. Kotlar T. Jameson J.L. Endocrinology. 2001; 142: 414-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Infection with Ad GHRH-R sensitized GH3 cells to the GHRH treatment and increased numbers of S-phase cells by 300% (Fig. 4C). To assess whether GHRH-induced proliferation requires Cdk4, Cdk4 was knocked down using siRNA. Cdk4 siRNA reduced levels of endogenous Cdk4 protein by about 80% (Fig. 4A) and decreased the numbers of GHRH-treated cells in the S-phase by 60% (Fig. 4, B and C). It should be noted that Cdk4 siRNA also decreased proliferation of cells cultured in the minimum medium without GHRH to a lesser extent than that of GHRH-treated GH3 cells (Fig. 4C). These data suggest GHRH-induced proliferation of somato/lactotroph cells requires Cdk4. Because we previously reported that Cdk4–/– MEFs proliferate normally under optimal growth-promoting conditions (5Tsutsui T. Hesabi B. Moons D.S. Pandolfi P.P. Hansel K.S. Koff A. Kiyokawa H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 7011-7019Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), we attempted to clarify whether Cdk4 is essential for the GHRH-mediated proliferation of MEFs. Upon ectopic expression of GHRH receptors, fibroblasts are capable of proliferating in response to GHRH (24Kiaris H. Schally A.V. Busto R. Halmos G. Artavanis-Tsakonas S. Varga J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 196-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Using Ad GHRH-R, we expressed GHRH receptors in MEFs prepared from Cdk4–/– and Cdk4+/+ E12.5 embryos and then cultured cells without or with GHRH (50 nm) for 4 days. GHRH treatment significantly increased cell numbers in Ad GHRH-R-infected MEF cultures regardless of the Cdk4 status (Fig. 4D). These observations indicate that, unlike GH3 cells, MEFs do not depend on Cdk4 for GHRH-mediated proliferation. Cdk4 Is Required for Estrogen-mediated Proliferation of Pituitary Cell Lines—Estrogen (E2) is a potent mitogen that stimulates lactotroph proliferation, mediating physiological lactotroph hyperplasia during pregnancy. We previously demonstrated that E2 administrations into mature Cdk4–/– female mice failed to increase numbers of lactotrophs, whereas the same treatment effectively induced lactotroph hyperplasia in Cdk4+/+ females (8Moons D.S. Jirawatnotai S. Parlow A.F. Gibori G. Kineman R.D. Kiyokawa H. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 3001-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, similar to GHRH-induced somatotroph hyperplasia, E2-induced lactotroph hyperplasia may require Cdk4. To elucidate whether estrogen signaling in lactotrophs requires intrinsic Cdk4 for proliferative response, we performed siRNA-mediated knockdown of Cdk4 in E2-treated GH3 cells. We also examined closely related GH4 somato/lactotroph cells (25Murdoch G.H. Potter E. Nicolaisen A.K. Evans R.M. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1982; 300: 192-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar) and human mammary carcinoma MCF-7 cells as a non-endocrine cell type responsive to estrogen. All of these cell lines depend largely on E2 for proliferation, and culture under E2-deprived conditions using charcoal-treated serum markedly inhibits proliferation (Fig. 5A). We also examined expression of G1-Cdks and D-type cyclins in E2-stimulated GH3 and MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5B). GH3 cells exhibited high levels of Cdk4, Cdk6, and Cdk2, whereas Cdk6 was undetectable in MCF-7 cells. Cyclin D1 was up-regulated by E2 in GH3 cells. Cyclin D3 levels were not altered by E2 in GH3 and MCF-7 cells, whereas cyclin D2 was barely detectable. GH4 cells showed similar expression patterns of these G1-regulatory proteins as GH3 cells (data not shown). Transfection with Cdk4 siRNA effectively decreased Cdk4 levels and brought down numbers of GH3 and GH4 cells in the S-phase (BrdUrd+) by 40 and 75%, respectively (Fig. 6A). We also found that the Cdk4 siRNA did not affect continuous proliferation of MEFs (Fig. 6A) despite >80% reduction in Cdk4 protein levels (data not shown). Although human Cdk4-specific siRNA decreased Cdk4 protein levels by 90% in MCF-7 cells, it did not alter BrdUrd incorporation under E2-induced or -deprived conditions (Fig. 6B). These data suggest that Cdk4 is dispensable for E2-responsive proliferation of MCF-7 cells. Consistently, stable silencing of Cdk4 using retrovirus-based Cdk4 siRNA did not impair proliferation of MCF-7 (data not shown). Moreover, we observed normal in vivo proliferation of mammary and uterine epithelial cells of Cdk4-null mice in response to estrogen administration. 2D. Moons and H. Kiyokawa, unpublished data. Therefore, Cdk4 is required specifically for postnatal proliferation of the somato/lactotroph in response to hormonal signals in a manner unique to these cell types. As GH3 and GH4 cells express high levels of Cdk6, we examined effects of siRNA-mediated knockdown of Cdk6 in these cells. Although Cdk6 siRNA specifically suppressed Cdk6 expression by 70–80% (Fig. 6C), E2-dependent proliferation of GH3 and GH4 cells was not affected (Fig. 6D). These results suggest that, unlike Cdk4, Cdk6 does not play a rate limiting role for proliferation of somato/lactotroph cells.Fig. 6Estrogen-mediated proliferation of somato/lactotroph cells depends on Cdk4.

In contrast to the single Cdk protein functioning in yeast cells, multiple Cdk proteins appear to collaborate in the mediation of cell cycle progression in mammalian cells. The observations that Cdk4-null mice are viable and develop almost normally except for particular endocrine organs (5Tsutsui T. Hesabi B. Moons D.S. Pandolfi P.P. Hansel K.S. Koff A. Kiyokawa H. Mol.

These data further support the notion that the mammalian Cdks and cyclins play overlapping roles in G1 cell cycle progression. However, expression patterns of multiple Cdk proteins do not simply explain the unique dependence of pituitary cells on Cdk4. GH3 somato/lactotroph cells express relatively high levels of Cdk4, Cdk6, and Cdk2 (Fig. 5B), whereas the cells depend on Cdk4 for GHRH- or estrogen-induced proliferation. In contrast, Cdk6 is undetectable in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells, which could proliferate normally with minimum levels of Cdk4. Moreover, Cdk2-null mice exhibit neither pituitary hypoplasia nor diabetes. 3S. Jirawatnotai, P. Kaldis, and H. Kiyokawa, unpublished observation. Although details of collaborations between different Cdk proteins remain to be clarified, characterizations of Cdk4-null mice revealed that Cdk4 plays unique indispensable roles in postnatal homeostasis of particular endocrine tissues, i.e. pituitary somato/lactotrophs and pancreatic β cells. During embryogenesis, precursor cells for the anterior pituitary lineages undergo dynamic regulation of proliferation and differentiation (36Burgess R. Lunyak V. Rosenfeld M. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Precursor cells committed to the anterior pituitary actively proliferate in the Rathke's pouch, which is controlled by the transcription factor Pitx2 with influences of growth factors, including BMP2 and FGF8. Subsequent regulation by lineage-specific transcription factors, such as Prop-1, Pit-1, and GATA-2, govern the cellular commitment process to each pituitary lineage. Apparently normal development of the embryonic pituitary in Cdk4-null mice indicates that Cdk4 is dispensable for proliferation associated with this series of developmental events. After terminal differentiation of each pituitary lineage, a variety of extracellular signals regulate homeostasis of the tissue. The pituitary gland responds to both hypothalamic and peripheral signals by undergoing reversible and adaptive changes in proliferation. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that differentiated pituitary cells with expression of specific hormone markers can continue mitosis. For example, adult pituitary glands slowly undergo hyperplastic changes during pregnancy, associated with estrogen-mediated proliferation of lactotrophs. It has been described that about 30% of rat pituitary cells arise from “adaptive” proliferation of terminally differentiated cells, whereas others are originated from undifferentiated precursors or stem cells (20Melmed S. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 112: 1603-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The proliferation defects in somatotrophs and lactotrophs of postnatal Cdk4-null mice suggest that proliferation of adult pituitary cells, possibly by mitosis of differentiated cells, depends on Cdk4 in a non-redundant manner. Similarly, the proliferation defect of Cdk4-null pancreatic β cells is restricted to postnatal animals (11Martin J. Hunt S.L. Dubus P. Sotillo R. Nehme-Pelluard F. Magnuson M.A. Parlow A.F. Malumbres M. Ortega S. Barbacid M. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 5261-5269Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 12Mettus R.V. Rane S.G. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 8413-8421Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Proliferation of terminally differentiated β cells has recently been clearly demonstrated (37Dor Y. Brown J. Martinez O.I. Melton D.A. Nature. 2004; 429: 41-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1906) Google Scholar, 38Bernard-Kargar C. Ktorza A. Diabetes. 2001; 50: S30-S35Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This unique requirement of the endocrine tissues for Cdk4 may imply that slow adaptive cell cycle progression is controlled by a mechanism distinct from the rapid cell cycle of regenerative tissues, e.g. the skin and digestive tracts. Possible fundamental differences in cell cycle control between differentiated endocrine cells and non-endocrine epithelial cells might be consistent with clinical data that tumors that arise from the pituitary or pancreatic islet rarely exhibit malignant phenotypes, whereas carcinomas can frequently develop from the regenerative tissues. Although the Rb/E2F pathway had been long thought to be the only target of Cdk4, a recent report described that Cdk4 phosphorylates and regulates Smad3, a transcription factor mediating the transforming growth factor β/activin signaling (39Matsuura I. Denissova N.G. Wang G. He D. Long J. Liu F. Nature. 2004; 430: 226-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). Thus, it will be important to determine whether Cdk4 regulates proliferation and function of postnatal endocrine tissues in a manner dependent on Rb or on other undefined substrates specific to the cell lineages. Studies on the genetically engineered mice with genomics and proteomics should provide us with further insight into tissue-specific control of the mammalian cell cycle.

Using a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatographic separation method in combination with mass spectrometric analysis, the present study investigated the alterations in histone H4 methylation/acetylation status and the interplay between H4 methylation and acetylation during in vitro differentiation of mouse erythroleukemia cells and how these modifications affect the chromatin structure. Independently of the type of inducer used (dimethyl sulfoxide, hexamethylenebisacetamide, butyrate, and trichostatin A), we observed a strong increase in non- and monoacetylated H4 lysine 20 (H4-Lys20) trimethylation. An increase in H4-Lys20 trimethylation, however, to a clearly lesser extent, was also found when cells accumulated in the stationary phase. Since we show that trimethylated H4-Lys20 is localized to heterochromatin, the increase in H4-Lys20 trimethylation observed indicates an accumulation of chromatin-dense and transcriptionally silent regions during differentiation and during the accumulation of control cells in the stationary phase, respectively. When using the deacetylase inhibitors butyrate or trichostatin A, we found that H4 hyperacetylation prevents H4-Lys20 trimethylation, but not mono- or dimethylation, and that the nonacetylated unmethylated H4-Lys20 is therefore the most suitable substrate for H4-Lys20 trimethylase. Summarizing, histone H4-Lys20 hypotrimethylation correlates with H4 hyperacetylation and H4-Lys20 hypertrimethylation correlates with H4 hypoacetylation. The results provide a model for how transcriptionally active euchromatin might be converted to the compacted, transcriptionally silent heterochromatin.

In eukaryotes, histone proteins associate with DNA to form nucleosomes that are folded into higher order chromatin structures. Differences in higher order chromatin structures, which are important prerequisites for numerous biological processes including cellular proliferation, differentiation, development, gene expression, genome stability, and cancer, are thought to be realized by a variety of posttranslational modifications of histone N termini, particularly of histones H3 and H4. Besides acetylation, histones are subjected to phosphorylation, methylation, ubiquitination, ADP-ribosylation, and deamidation (1van Holde K.E. Rich A. Chromatin. Springer, New York1988: 111-148Google Scholar, 2Lindner H. Sarg B. Hoertnagl B. Helliger W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13324-13330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Distinct combinations of covalent histone modifications including lysine acetylation, lysine and arginine methylation, and serine phosphorylation form the basis of the histone code hypothesis (3Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6530) Google Scholar, 4Turner B.M. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 5Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7570) Google Scholar). This hypothesis proposes that a pre-existing modification affects subsequent modifications on histone tails and that these modifications generate unique surfaces for the binding of various proteins or protein complexes responsible for higher order chromatin organization and gene activation and inactivation. Some of the histone-modifying enzymes (e.g. lysine methyltransferases) are, when deregulated, considered to be involved in carcinogenesis (6Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Kouzarides T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2002; 27: 396-402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Histone H4 is typically acetylated at lysines 5, 8, 12, and 16, methylated at arginine 3 and lysine 20, and phosphorylated at serine 1 (3Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6530) Google Scholar, 7Wang H. Huang Z.Q. Xia L. Feng Q. Erdjument-Bromage H. Strahl B.D. Briggs S.D. Allis C.D. Wong J. Tempst P. Zhang Y.

Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: 996-1000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar). Unlike the dynamic process of histone acetylation and phosphorylation, histone methylation is regarded as a relatively static long-term signal with a low turnover of the methyl group. Whereas arginine can be either mono- or dimethylated (the latter in symmetric or asymmetric form), lysine methylation can occur as a mono-, di-, or trimethylated derivative. In contrast to histone H3 methylation, H4-Lys20 was long considered to be maximally dimethylated in mammals (9Annunziato A.T. Eason M.B. Perry C.A. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2916-2924Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Most recently, however, Sarg et al. (10Sarg B. Koutzamani E. Helliger W. Rundquist I. Lindner H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39195-39201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) conducted a mass spectrometric analysis with a newly developed hydrophilic interaction chromatographic method enabling the simultaneous separation of methylated and acetylated forms and, for the first time, found in vivo evidence that H4-Lys20 is also trimethylated in mammalian tissue. Moreover, in rat liver and kidney the proportion of trimethylated histone H4 increases during aging. In Raji and K562 cells the trimethylated form was also detected, primarily when the cells were accumulated in the stationary phase (10Sarg B. Koutzamani E. Helliger W. Rundquist I. Lindner H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39195-39201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Most recently, two novel SET domain histone methyltransferases, Suv4-20h1 and Suv4-20h2, acting as nucleosomal H4-Lys20 trimethylating enzymes, have been identified (11Schotta G. Lachner M. Sarma K. Ebert A. Sengupta R. Reuter G. Reinberg D. Jenuwein T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). It was also shown that histone H3-Lys9 trimethylation is required for the induction of H4-Lys20 trimethylation (H4-tri-meLys20) and that trimethylation of histone H3-Lys9 and histone H4-Lys20 functions as a repressive mark in gene-silencing mechanisms (11Schotta G.

Studies investigating possible links between histone methylation and acetylation have revealed that methylation of Arg3 of H4 by the histone H4-specific protein methyltransferase PRMT 1 facilitates acetylation by p300 on histone H4-Lys8 and -Lys12 and that this methylation at position 3 plays an important role in transcriptional regulation (7Wang H. Huang Z.Q. Xia L. Feng Q. Erdjument-Bromage H. Strahl B.D. Briggs S.D. Allis C.D. Wong J. Tempst P. Zhang Y. Science. 2001; 293: 853-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 8Strahl B.D.

Acetylation on any of the four H4 lysines on the N-terminal tail (Lys5, Lys8, Lys12, Lys16), however, inhibits the methylation of Arg3 by PRMT 1 (7Wang H. Huang Z.Q. Xia L. Feng Q.

These results demonstrating the interplay between histone H4 methylation and acetylation support the histone code hypothesis. Recent findings suggest that histone H4-Lys20 methylation inhibits H4-Lys16 acetylation and vice versa, leading to the hypothesis that methylation of H4-Lys20 maintains silent chromatin, in part by precluding neighboring acetylation on the H4 tail (13Nishioka K. Rice J.C. Sarma K. Erdjument-Bromage H. Werner J. Wang Y. Chuikov S. Valenzuela P. Tempst P. Steward R. Lis J.T. Allis C.D. Reinberg D. Mol.

Genes Dev. 2002; 16: 2225-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). These studies, however, did not discriminate between the individual methylation states (3Strahl B.D. Allis C.D. Nature. 2000; 403: 41-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (6530) Google Scholar, 4Turner B.M. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 836-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar, 5Jenuwein T. Allis C.D. Science. 2001; 293: 1074-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (7570) Google Scholar). Of particular interest are recent findings regarding the role of various states of histone H3/H4 methylation in the regulation of transcription. In contrast to the dimethylated state of histone H3-Lys4, which occurs at both inactive and active euchromatic genes, H3-Lys4 trimethylation is present exclusively at active genes (15Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bannister A.J. Sherriff J. Bernstein B.E. Emre N.C. Schreiber S.L. Mellor J. Kouzarides T. Nature. 2002; 419: 407-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (1587) Google Scholar), whereas H3-Lys9 trimethylation and also H4-Lys20 trimethylation are present in repressive chromatin domains (11Schotta G. Lachner M. Sarma K. Ebert A. Sengupta R. Reuter G. Reinberg D. Jenuwein T. Genes Dev. 2004; 18: 1251-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar, 15Santos-Rosa H. Schneider R. Bannister A.J.

It is obvious, therefore, that not only methylation in itself but the precise methylation state and the position of the lysine determine gene activity/repression. In the present study we aimed to investigate the changes in Lys20 methylation states of non-, mono-, di-, tri-, and tetraacetylated H4 histones as well as the interplay between the various H4-Lys20 methylation states and acetylation during in vitro differentiation of mouse erythroleukemia cells induced by Me2SO 1The abbreviations used are: Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; DAPI, 4-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; HDAC, histone deacetylase; HILIC, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography; HMBA, hexamethylenebisacetamide; HP1, heterochromatin protein-1; MEL, mouse erythroleukemia; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography; TEA, triethylamine; TSA, trichostatin A.1The abbreviations used are: Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; DAPI, 4-6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; ESI-MS, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry; HDAC, histone deacetylase; HILIC, hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography; HMBA, hexamethylenebisacetamide; HP1, heterochromatin protein-1; MEL, mouse erythroleukemia; RP-HPLC, reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography; TEA, triethylamine; TSA, trichostatin A./HMBA and the deacetylase inhibitors sodium butyrate/TSA, respectively. For the analysis we used a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatographic method recently developed in our laboratory (2Lindner H. Sarg B. Hoertnagl B. Helliger W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13324-13330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 16Sarg B. Helliger W. Hoertnagl B. Puschendorf B. Lindner H. Arch. Biochem.

In all cases and regardless of the nature of the inducer we found a strong increase in the trimethylated Lys20 of non- and monoacetylated histone H4 (ac0 H4-tri-meLys20 and ac1 H4-tri-meLys20, respectively) during differentiation. By using an antibody that specifically recognizes trimethylated Lys20 of histone H4, it was possible to demonstrate that H4-tri-meLys20 localizes to heterochromatin. The observed increase in non- and monoacetylated H4-tri-meLys20 thus results in an increase in heterochromatic regions, thereby indicating chromatin compaction and repression of gene activity in the course of erythroid differentiation. Treatment of mouse erythroleukemia cells with sodium butyrate or TSA resulted in H4 histone hyperacetylation. With regard to the individual acetylated forms in detail, we found diacetylated H4-Lys20 to be trimethylated in traces, whereas tri- and tetraacetylated H4-Lys20 were not trimethylated at all. We therefore suggest that in contrast to non- and monoacetylated H4 histones, which correlate with H4-tri-meLys20, histone H4 hyperacetylation precludes Lys20 trimethylation, thus providing further support for the histone code hypothesis. Independently of the degree of acetylation, however, we found histone H4-di-meLys20 and, to a far lesser extent, histone H4-mono-meLys20. Materials—Sodium perchlorate (NaClO4), triethylamine (TEA), acetonitrile, and trifluoroacetic acid were purchased from Fluka (Buchs, Switzerland). All other chemicals were purchased from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) if not otherwise indicated. Cell Culture—Mouse erythroleukemia (MEL) cells (line F4N) were grown in Dulbecco's minimum Eagle's medium (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) containing 2× nonessential amino acids, 1× penicillin-streptomycin, and 10% fetal calf serum. Cells were cultured at initial cell densities of 5.104-7.104/ml at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Differentiation was induced by the addition of 2% Me2SO (for 144 h), 5 mm HMBA (144 h), 4 ng/ml TSA (144 h), or 1.75 mm sodium butyrate (72 h). The untreated control cells were harvested after 72 h in the log phase or after 144 h in stationary phase. The percentage of benzidine-positive cells was determined as described by Orkin et al. (20Orkin S.H. Harosi F.I. Leder P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 98-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Preparations of Histones—The histones were extracted from MEL cells with sulfuric acid (0.2 m) according to the procedure of Helliger et al. (21Helliger W. Lindner H. Grubl-Knosp O. Puschendorf B. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 747-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). High Performance Liquid Chromatography—The equipment used consisted of a 127 Solvent Module and a Model 166 UV-visible region detector (Beckman Instruments). The effluent was monitored at 210 nm, and the peaks were recorded using Beckman System Gold software. Solvent compositions are expressed as v/v throughout this text. Reversed-phase HPLC—The separation of core histones was performed on a Nucleosil C4 column (250 × 8-mm inner diameter, 5-μm particle pore size, 30-nm pore size, end-capped; Seibersdorf). Samples (∼500 μg) were injected onto the column. The histone sample was chromatographed as described previously (10Sarg B. Koutzamani E. Helliger W. Rundquist I. Lindner H.H. J. Biol.

Hydrophilic Interaction Liquid Chromatography—The histone fraction H4 (∼100 μg) isolated by RP-HPLC was further separated on a SynChropak CM300 column (250 × 4.6-mm inner diameter, 6.5-μm particle size, 30-nm pore size; Agilent Technologies, Vienna, Austria) at 30 °C and at a constant flow of 1.0 ml/min using a multi-step gradient starting at solvent A-solvent B (100:0) (solvent A: 70% acetonitrile, 0.015 m TEA/H3PO4, pH = 3.0; solvent B: 65% acetonitrile, 0.015 m TEA/H3PO4, pH = 3.0, and 0.68 m NaClO4). The concentration of solvent B was increased from 0 to 10% B in 2 min and from 10 to 40% in 30 min and was then maintained at 40% for 10 min. The isolated protein fractions were desalted using RP-HPLC. Histone fractions obtained in this way were collected and, after the addition of 20 μl of 2-mercaptoethanol (0.2 m), were lyophilized and stored at -20 °C. Endoproteinase Glu-C Digestion—Histone H4 (∼ 10 μg) obtained by HILIC fractionation was digested with Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease (Roche Applied Science; 1:20 w/w) in 50 μl of 25 mm NH4HCO3 buffer (pH 4.0) for1hat room temperature. The digest was subjected to RP-HPLC as described previously (10Sarg B. Koutzamani E. Helliger W. Rundquist I. Lindner H.H. J. Biol.

Endoproteinase Lys-C Digestion—N-terminal peptides obtained by Glu-C digestion were further cleaved with endoproteinase Lys-C (Roche Applied Science; 1:5 w/w) in 15 μl of 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.7) for 2 h at 37 °C. The digest was subjected to RP-HPLC-ESI-MS. Mass Spectrometric Analysis—Histone H4 peptide fractions obtained by endoproteinase Lys-C cleavage were injected onto a PepMap C18 column (150 × 1-mm inner diameter, 3-μm particle size; ICT, Vienna, Austria). The column eluate was coupled directly to a Finnigan LCQ ion trap instrument (San Jose, CA) equipped with an electrospray source (RP-HPLC-ESI-MS). Samples of ∼1 μg were chromatographed within 55 min at a constant flow of 35 μl/min with a two-step acetonitrile gradient starting at solvent A - solvent B (90:10) (solvent A: water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid; solvent B: 85% acetonitrile and 0.093% trifluoroacetic acid). The concentration of solvent B was increased linearly from 10 to 40% over a 45-min period and from 40 to 100% over 20 min. Antibodies—The antibodies used were: rabbit polyclonal to H4-tri-meLys20 (Abcam), Western blotting 1:1000, immunofluorescence 1:200; rat monoclonal to HP1β (Abcam), immunofluorescence 1:50; mouse monoclonal to RNA polymerase II (Abcam), immunofluorescence 1:50. For Western blotting, goat anti-rabbit IgG peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) 1:5000 was used as secondary antibody. The secondary antibodies for immunofluorescence were: goat anti-rabbit IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate (Sigma), 1:160; goat anti-rat IgG Cy3 conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch), 1:160; goat anti-mouse IgG Cy3 conjugate (Jackson ImmunoResearch), 1:160. Western Blotting—Histones were resolved in SDS-loading buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was probed with antibodies using standard techniques and detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Immunofluorescence—MEL cells were grown in suspension culture, collected by centrifugation, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline. 105 cells were cytospun onto slides. Cells were permeabilized using Triton X-100 (1% for 2 min and 0.1% for 10 min) in KCM buffer (120 mm KCl, 20 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.5) and incubated sequentially with the primary and secondary antibodies. Cells were fixed for 5 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in KCM, stained with DAPI for 1 min, and mounted in mounting medium (Dako). Staining was visualized using an ×100 objective on a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope and a SPOT camera (Diagnostic Instruments). Images were captured using MetaVue software (Universal Imaging Corp.) and analyzed with Corel Photo-Paint 10. HILIC Separation of Modified Forms of Histone H4 of Uninduced MEL Cells and Cells Cultured in the Presence of Me2SO, HMBA, Sodium Butyrate, and TSA—Untreated MEL cells and cells treated with Me2SO, HMBA, sodium butyrate, and TSA were grown in culture. After 72 and 144 h and before harvesting the cells, the number of benzidine-positive cells indicating hemoglobin accumulation was determined. In the case of butyrate-treated cells, however, the study was limited to the first 72 h, because butyrate is metabolized by the cells, and after a certain time its concentration is reduced to a level below that required to stimulate differentiation (23Friend C. Zajac-Kaye M. Holland J.G. Pogo B.G. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 378-382PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas throughout the entire period study untreated cultures were found to contain a very low level (less than 2%) of spontaneously differentiated cells, cultures containing Me2SO, HMBA, or butyrate produced ∼80–95% benzidine-positive cells and those containing TSA nearly 70%. The sulfuric acid-extracted core histones were fractionated using an RP-HPLC procedure described previously (10Sarg B. Koutzamani E. Helliger W. Rundquist I. Lindner H.H. J. Biol.

Helliger W. Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 251: 75-88PubMed Google Scholar). A number of major and minor peaks could be received, which were identified by ESI-MS as described previously (10Sarg B. Koutzamani E. Helliger W. Rundquist I. Lindner H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39195-39201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the pattern of histone H4 acetylation and methylation of untreated (control) MEL cells at 72 h (Fig. 1A) and 144 h (Fig. 1B) after seeding, respectively, and of cells grown for 72 h in the presence of butyrate (Fig. 1C) and 144 h in the presence of Me2SO (Fig. D). The histone H4 acetylation/methylation pattern of MEL cells grown for 144 h in the presence of TSA and HMBA resembled that obtained by treating with butyrate and Me2SO, respectively (data not shown). In control cells and cells treated with Me2SO and HMBA, histone H4 was hypoacetylated, containing primarily non acetylated (ac0) and monoacetylated (ac1) forms with Lys16 as the most frequently acetylated lysine residue. In response to Me2SO treatment, a clear increase in trimethylated unacetylated and trimethylated monoacetylated H4 species was observed (Fig. 1, D versus B). Treatment of cells with butyrate and TSA, known HDAC inhibitors, caused hyperacetylation of H4, in which up to four acetyl groups are bound to the N-terminal tail. The results revealed that H4-Lys20 is methylated in all of the acetylated isoforms, as well as in the nonacetylated isoform, apart from a nonmethylated H4 present in varying amounts. In general, the dimethylated form was found to be the main methylation product followed, in smaller amounts, by the mono- and trimethylated forms. To facilitate an unambiguous assignment, the double peak of triacetylated H4 histones (designated in Fig. 1C with an asterisk) had to be investigated in more detail. Characterization of Hyperacetylated H4 Fractions from Butyrate-treated Cells Obtained by HILIC—To precisely determine the modification status of hyperacetylated histone H4 shown in Fig. 1C, the HILIC fractions were isolated, desalted by RP-HPLC, and treated with endoproteinase Glu-C as described previously (10Sarg B. Koutzamani E. Helliger W. Rundquist I. Lindner H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39195-39201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The fragmentation yielded an N-terminal peptide (residues 1–52 and 1–53) that was further cleaved with endoproteinase Lys-C. Endoproteinase Lys-C is a serine protease, and its activity is inhibited at lysine residues that have been modified by an acetyl or methyl group (10Sarg B. Koutzamani E. Helliger W. Rundquist I. Lindner H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39195-39201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The digests were analyzed by RP-HPLC-ESI-MS using a 150 × 1.0-mm inner diameter microbore column. The diacetylated (ac2) form was found to be acetylated at Lys16 and Lys12, and as can be seen from the separation pattern in Fig. 1C, was mainly dimethylated followed by the monomethylated derivative and, present in trace amounts only, the trimethylated one. In the case of the triacetylated H4 protein (marked with an asterisk), which is separated into two HILIC subfractions, several peptide fragments were detected (Fig. 2). ESI-MS analysis revealed a triacetylated H4-di-meLys20 form with acetyl groups at either Lys8-Lys12-Lys16 or Lys5-Lys12-Lys16 and, in very small amounts, at Lys5-Lys8-Lys16. This finding that the various lysines are partially occupied in the triacetylated form agrees well with observations made by other investigators (24Turner B.M. O'Neill L.P. Allan I.M. FEBS Lett. 1989; 253: 141-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 25Clarke D.J. O'Neill L.P. Turner B.M. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Interestingly, a peptide corresponding to the tetraacetylated (Lys5-Lys8-Lys12-Lys16) nonmethylated form, which could not be separated by the HILIC system, was found in the ac3 double peak. A triacetylated trimethylated H4 histone, however, was undetectable. Concerning the tetraacetylated H4 protein, two HILIC subfractions containing one or two methyl groups were identified. Similar to triacetylated H4, a tetraacetylated trimethylated H4 was also not seen. At any rate, however, the H4-di-meLys20 form predominates in the hyperacetylated histone H4 fractions. The Levels of H4-tri-meLys20 Are Raised in Hypoacetylated H4 Fractions during MEL Cell Differentiation—We recently showed for the first time that histone H4 from mammalian tissue is not only mono- and dimethylated but also trimethylated at Lys20 and that the trimethylated form accumulates with age and in cells in the stationary phase (10Sarg B. Koutzamani E. Helliger W. Rundquist I. Lindner H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 39195-39201Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Novel studies on methylated histones have revealed that H4-tri-meLys20 is a repressive mark in gene silencing and is important for heterochromatin assembly (11Schotta G. Lachner M. Sarma K. Ebert A.

We were thus interested in investigating the occurrence of trimethylated H4 in differentiated cells. To obtain quantitative data, we conducted a HILIC analysis of histone H4 from MEL cells treated with various inducers and quantified the results. As depicted in Fig. 3A, an increase of about 70% in trimethylated H4 (ac0 + ac1) forms appears in non-growing cells. Upon induction a remarkable further increase to the 4–5-fold level occurs in differentiated cel"

Recent crystal structures of the Nurr1 ligand binding domain (LBD) and the Drosophila orthologue dHR38 revealed that, although these receptors share the classical LBD architecture, they lack a ligand binding cavity. This volume is instead filled with bulky hydrophobic side chains. Furthermore the “canonical” non-polar co-regulator binding groove is filled with polar side chains; thus, the regulation of transcription by this sub-family of nuclear receptor LBDs may be mediated by some other interaction surface on the LBD. We report here the identification of a novel co-regulator interface on the LBD of Nurr1. We used an NMR footprinting strategy that facilitates the identification of an interaction surface without the need of a full assignment. We found that non-polar peptides derived from the co-repressors SMRT and NCoR bind to a hydrophobic patch on the LBD of Nurr1. This binding surface involves a groove between helices 11 and 12. Mutations in this site abolish activation by the Nurr1 LBD. These findings give insight into the unique mechanism of action of this class of nuclear receptors.

Nuclear receptors comprise a large and ancient family of intra-cellular transcription factors that regulate many aspects of development and metabolism in metazoans. The activity of many nuclear receptors, especially those in vertebrates, is controlled by the binding of fat-soluble hormones and metabolites within a non-polar cavity in the ligand binding domain (LBD) 1The abbreviations used are: LBD, ligand binding domain; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum coherence; TR, thyroid hormone receptor. of the receptor. The mechanisms through which these small molecules switch the activity of the receptor have been established (reviewed in Ref. 1Nagy L. Schwabe J.W.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 317-324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). Ligand binding stabilizes the global structure of the LBD (2Johnson B.A. Wilson E.M. Li Y. Moller D.E.

Love J.D. Chatterjee V.K. Schwabe J.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). This results in the displacement of co-repressor proteins and the recruitment of co-activator proteins. Both co-repressor and co-activator proteins bind to the same non-polar groove on the surface of the LBD through related but distinct interaction motifs that adopt an amphipathic helical conformation (5Nolte R.T.

Lazar M.A. Nature. 1999; 402: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Discrimination between co-activators and co-repressors is achieved because the active position of helix 12 does not allow binding of the longer co-repressor helix but stabilizes the binding of the shorter co-activator helix. Although this mechanism is relevant for ligand-regulated receptors, it has become clear that in vertebrates a significant number of nuclear receptors are probably not regulated by a ligand (11Mangelsdorf D.J. Evans R.M. Cell. 1995; 83: 841-850Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2849) Google Scholar). This is a reflection of the evolutionarily adaptable nature of the nuclear receptor ligand binding domain that has resulted in many instances of loss (and gain) of ligand regulation (12Escriva H. Delaunay F. Laudet V. BioEssays. 2000; 22: 717-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 13Schwabe J.W. Teichmann S.A.

In vertebrates three closely related receptors, Nurr1 (NR4A2), Nur77 (NGFI-B/NR4A1), and Nor1 (NR4A3), belong to this last group of orphans (19Maruyama K. Tsukada T. Ohkura N. Bandoh S. Hosono T. Yamaguchi K. Int. J. Oncol. 1998; 12: 1237-1243PubMed Google Scholar). All three play a role in the central nervous system as well as in other tissues. Much interest has, in particular, focused on Nurr1 because it plays an important role in the development of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain and may represent a therapeutic target to treat Parkinson's disease (20Buervenich S. Carmine A. Arvidsson M. Xiang F. Zhang Z. Sydow O. Jonsson E.G. Sedvall G.C. Leonard S. Ross R.G. Freedman R. Chowdari K.V. Nimgaonkar V.L. Perlmann T. Anvret M. Olson L. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2000; 96: 808-813Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We know that this group of receptors lacks a ligand binding cavity, because crystal structures of the ligand binding domain from Nurr1 (17Wang Z. Benoit G. Liu J. Prasad S. Aarnisalo P. Liu X. Xu H. Walker N.P. Perlmann T. Nature. 2003; 423: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar) and its orthologue in Drosophila, dHR38 (18Baker K.D. Shewchuk L.M. Kozlova T. Makishima M. Hassell A. Wisely B. Caravella J.A. Lambert M.H. Reinking J.L. Krause H. Thummel C.S. Willson T.M. Mangelsdorf D.J. Cell. 2003; 113: 731-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), revealed that the ligand binding cavity is almost entirely filled with bulky hydrophobic side chains. This implies that this family of receptors cannot bind and is not regulated by ligands in the conventional fashion. These structures also revealed that the canonical co-regulator binding groove observed in other receptors is filled with polar side chains and is therefore not likely to support conventional non-polar interactions with co-regulators. This would appear to suggest that the LBD of Nurr1 and related receptors might, at first sight, be inert and play no direct role in the regulation of transcription. However, this is clearly not the case, because the Nurr1 LBD exhibits a potent activation function, albeit dependent upon cell type. Thus, the question is how can the Nurr1 LBD activate transcription when the lack of a conventional co-regulator binding groove would appear to preclude interaction with known co-regulator proteins. The simplest answer to this is that there is another, as yet unidentified co-regulator interaction surface. These issues thus raise two questions: what are the co-regulators that interact with the Nurr1 LBD, and where on the surface of the LBD do they interact? Various interaction studies have shown that the co-repressor proteins SMRT (21Sohn Y.C. Kwak E. Na Y. Lee J.W. Lee S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43734-43739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and PIASγ (22Galleguillos D. Vecchiola A. Fuentealba J.A. Ojeda V. Alvarez K. Gomez A. Andres M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 2005-2011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) are able to bind to the Nur77 and Nurr1 LBDs, respectively. An interaction was also inferred with an ASC-2 adaptor protein (21Sohn Y.C. Kwak E. Na Y. Lee J.W. Lee S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43734-43739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Finally, it was also shown that the N-terminal AF1 domains of Nur77 and Nor1 interact directly with their respective LBDs and that this interaction is stabilized by the co-activator protein SRC-2 (23Wansa K.D. Harris J.M. Muscat G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33001-33011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 24Wansa K.D. Harris J.M. Yan G. Ordentlich P. Muscat G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 24776-24790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). To identify the surface or surfaces on the Nurr1 LBD that might mediate interaction with co-regulators and the N-terminal AF1 domain, we explored its interactions with peptides from conserved regions of the N-terminal domain of Nurr1 and from the co-repressors SMRT and NCoR (a SMRT homologue). None of these peptides have been reported previously to interact with the Nurr1 LBD, but such interactions seemed to be a possibility given the homology between Nurr1 and both Nur77 and Nor1. The receptor interaction domains from SMRT and NCoR were found to interact with the Nurr1 LBD in pull-down, fluorescence quenching, and NMR binding assays. Calculation of the hydrophobic potential of the surface of the Nurr1 LBD led to the identification of a highly hydrophobic patch/groove between helices 11 and 12 suggestive of an interaction surface. Mutations in this region confirmed its role in co-repressor interaction using both NMR footprinting and pull-down assays. Preparation of Recombinant Nurr1—The uniformly 15N-labeled Nurr1 LBD (amino acids 353–598 preceded by a non-native glycine; molecular mass of 27.8kDa) was expressed with a hexahistidine tag and a tobacco etch virus protease cleavage site at the N terminus using the pET-13a expression vector in the Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). Cells were grown in M9 medium supplemented with 1 g/liter 15NH4Cl, 2 g/liter glucose, nitrogen bases, vitamins, and oligoelements as described previously (25Codina A. Gairi M. Tarrago T. Viguera A.R. Feliz M. Ludevid D. Giralt E. J. Biomol. NMR. 2002; 22: 295-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Cells were grown at 37 °C to an A600 of 0.6–0.8 and induced with 0.4 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Three hours after induction, cells were harvested and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.5 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulphonyl fluoride-HCl, and the complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science)). The lysate was clarified by centrifugation (40,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C), and the His tag protein was bound to nickel-agarose resin (Qiagen). The resin was washed extensively with wash buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 10% glycerol), and the protein was eluted and cleaved from the tag by on-resin His-tagged tobacco etch virus digestion overnight at 4 °C. Cleaved protein was concentrated and purified by size exclusion chromatography using a Sephadex S200 column. The gel filtration buffer (buffer X) was 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 6.9, 50 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, and protease inhibitors. Nurr1 was further concentrated to 0.3–0.7 mm, and 7% (v/v) D20 was added to the NMR sample. 15N labeled Nurr1 mutants were expressed, purified, and concentrated as described for the wild-type protein. Cell-free Protein Preparation and Peptide Interaction Assays—Proteins were transcribed and translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine using a T7 polymerase/S30 (EcoProRmix T7) extract-coupled transcription/translation system according to the manufacturer's instructions (Novagen). The quality of translation and labeling was monitored using SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The Nurr1 mutants were prepared using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis protocol from Novagen. Vent DNA polymerase was used instead of PfuTurbo and SOC medium (2% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 10 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl2, and 20 mM glucose) instead of NZY+ in the transformation step. The mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The peptides were synthesized chemically (Southampton PolyPeptides Ltd). Lyophilized peptides were resuspended in buffer X or in H2O/buffer X mixtures depending on their solubility. The primary amino groups (amino termini and/or lysine side chains) of the synthetic peptides were coupled with an N-hydroxysuccinimideactivated affinity resin according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Peptide interaction assays were carried out by adding the 35S-labeled Nurr1 to the peptide affinity resin in the binding buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, 50 mm NaCl, 0.02% NaN3, protease inhibitors, and 0.5% Triton X-100) at 4 °C for 1 h. After extensive washing with the same buffer, the protein was eluted from the resin with sample buffer, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by autoradiography. NMR—NMR spectra were recorded on Bruker Avance 800 and DMX 600 spectrometers equipped with 5-mm triple resonance (1H-15N-13C) single-axis gradient probes. Data were processed using the program NMRPipe (26Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol.

NMR. 1994; 4: 603-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (2692) Google Scholar). All NMR data were acquired at 300 K. Titrations were made by adding successive amounts of peptide (CR1, CR1b, and N1-N5) to a solution containing 0.3 mm protein and acquiring HSQC spectra at peptide to protein ratios of 0.5:1, 1:1, 2:1, 4:1, 6:1, and 8:1. The Nurr1 concentration was derived from A280 measurements using an extinction coefficient calibrated by determining the concentration by amino acid analysis on an Amersham Biosciences Biochrom 20-amino acid analyzer after 18 h in 6 m HCl at 110 °C. Peptide concentrations were calculated from dry weight. Fluorescence Quenching Assays—Fluorescence spectra were recorded in a Luminescence Spectrometer LS 50 B (Perkin Elmer) controlled by a personal computer equipped with FL Winlab software (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Tryptophan quenching was measured at 20 °C. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm, and fluorescence emission scans were recorded between 260 and 450 nm at 200 nm/min. The excitation and emission slit widths were at 5 and 10 nm, respectively. Titrations were made by adding successive amounts of the CR1 peptide to a 500-μl solution containing 11.3 μm Nurr1 in buffer X (the A280 of the solution was between 0.5 and 1 so that the quenching process is linear). The peptide was dissolved in 50 μl of the same protein solution. A three-scan spectrum was recorded after each peptide addition (0–27 μl of the peptide solution). Data were analyzed assuming static quenching using the program Prism® (GraphPad). Peptide Interaction with the Nurr1 LBD—To identify potential interaction surfaces on the Nurr1 LBD, we first sought to identify, using a pull-down assay, short peptides that are able to interact with the Nurr1 LBD. Candidate peptides of a diverse character were derived from the nuclear receptor co-repressors SMRT and NCoR and the N-terminal AF1 domain of Nurr1 (Fig. 1), which have previously been reported to interact with the LBD of this class of receptors (21Sohn Y.C. Kwak E. Na Y. Lee J.W. Lee S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43734-43739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 23Wansa K.D. Harris J.M. Muscat G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 33001-33011Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). A peptide from the co-activator SRC-1, which is not thought to interact with the Nurr1 LBD (28Castro D.S. Arvidsson M. Bondesson Bolin M. Perlmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37483-37490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), was also included in the assay. The Nurr1 AF1 domain peptides were chosen on the basis of a region of high homology with Nur77 and Nor1. The co-regulator peptides were chosen on the basis of minimal regions required for interaction with other nuclear receptors. Peptides were coupled chemically to N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated Sepharose and challenged with in vitro translated and [35S]methionine-labeled Nurr1 LBD (Fig. 1). The two co-repressor peptides (CR1 and CR2) recruited the Nurr1 LBD more strongly than either of the two controls (resin alone and resin coupled to bacterially expressed Nurr1 LBD). Furthermore, as has been previously reported for Nur77 (21Sohn Y.C. Kwak E. Na Y. Lee J.W. Lee S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43734-43739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), mutation of the four conserved hydrophobic residues in the co-repressor peptide (CR1m) abolishes interaction with the Nurr1 LBD (Fig. 1). This finding suggests that although Nurr1 lacks the canonical non-polar co-regulator interaction groove, the nature of the interaction with the co-repressor peptides might be rather similar to that with other nuclear receptors. As expected, the co-activator peptide CA did not recruit the Nurr1 LBD. Of the peptides derived from the N-terminal domain of Nurr1, only N1 (comprising the 13 N-terminal residues of the receptor) was observed to recruit the LBD. Significantly, this N-terminal peptide bears no sequence similarity to the co-repressor peptides, suggesting that the interaction between this peptide and the Nurr1 LBD might be very different in nature. To further investigate the interaction between the Nurr1 LBD and the various peptides, we examined the effect of adding increasing amounts of a peptide to a 15N-Nurr1 LBD sample and recording a 1H-15N HSQC NMR spectrum at each step of the titration. Although we observed an apparently tight interaction between the N1 peptide and the Nurr1 LBD in the pull-down assay, titrations with this peptide resulted in no discernible perturbations in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra, even at ratios of peptide to protein as high as 8:1. We conclude from this result that the pull-down assay with this peptide is misleading, possibly due to oxidation of the cysteine residue. Several of the other N-terminal peptides did cause some limited spectral perturbations, but because these were only seen at high peptide/LBD ratios and interaction was not observed in the pull-down assay, they were not investigated further. In contrast to the N-terminal peptides, the addition of the CR1 peptide to the 15N-Nurr1 LBD resulted in numerous changes in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum even at a 1:1 ratio. The 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the Nurr1 LBD contain 191 sharp, well resolved backbone amide resonances as well as a few resolved side chain amide protons. The CR1 peptide caused significant chemical shift perturbations and/or broadening of 56 of these resonances (Fig. 2). The observed changes are reproducible and are essentially identical using peptides derived from either SMRT (CR1) or NCoR (CR1b; inset in Fig. 2). The addition of more peptide induced further changes in the spectrum, suggesting that the binding is not fully saturated at 1:1 and, therefore, that the binding is rather weak (saturation is reached around 8:1). It is also possible that the peptide binds to multiple sites in fast exchange. However, the number of observed spectral changes and the titration profile suggest that the co-repressor peptide is probably interacting with a single site on the surface of the Nurr1 LBD. Notably, many of the spectral changes on peptide addition involve broadening as well as chemical shift perturbations. This broadening suggests that the exchange may be in the intermediate rate regime (29Zuiderweg E.R. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). To gain a measure of the binding affinity of the CR1 peptide, we monitored the quenching of tryptophan fluorescence upon the addition of peptide to the Nurr1 LBD in solution (Fig. 3). There are two tryptophan residues in the LBD, residues 420 and 482, both of which are partially exposed to solvent. The titration of bacterially expressed Nurr1 LBD with increasing amounts of the CR1 peptide showed a saturable 30% quench in the total tryptophan fluorescence (Fig. 3a). This finding is most likely due to static (rather than collisional) quenching of one of the tryptophans as a result of peptide binding to the Nurr1 LBD. These data suggest that the peptide is probably interacting with a single site on the surface of the LBD, although it is not possible to rule out binding to multiple sites with similar affinity. The observed Kq (Fig. 3b) indicates a dissociation constant of ∼50 μm, assuming static quenching and single site binding. This dissociation constant is apparently two orders of magnitude higher than that of other measured co-regulator-LBD interactions (30Iannone M.A. Consler T.G. Pearce K.H. Stimmel J.B. Parks D.J. Gray J.G. Cytometry. 2001; 44: 326-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This finding fits with the observed behavior in the NMR experiments but may indicate that this short peptide does not recapitulate full physiological interaction. It is also possible that, as has been suggested for co-activators, the co-repressor interaction could require other stabilizing factors. However it should be noted that the pull-down assays, which include a stringent washing procedure, show a clear recruitment of the Nurr1 LBD by this peptide. Prediction of a Peptide Binding Surface—Given that the Nurr1 LBD is able to interact with the receptor interaction domains from co-repressor proteins but lacks a conventional co-regulator interaction surface, we wished to understand where on the surface of the LBD the co-repressor peptides are binding. Because we and others have found that the interaction requires the conserved hydrophobic residues in the CoR peptide, we might expect this surface to be largely non-polar. Hydrophobic potential mapping has proven to be a useful way of identifying non-polar interaction surfaces on proteins of known structure (for an example, see Ref. 31Owen D.J. Vallis Y. Noble M.E. Hunter J.B. Dafforn T.R. Evans P.R. McMahon H.T. Cell. 1999; 97: 805-815Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). For such mapping, the energy of a hydrophobic probe is calculated using the program GRID (32Goodford P. J. Chemometrics. 1996; 10: 107-117Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) and displayed as a potential map. Such analysis of the surface of the Nurr1 LBD compared with that of the TR LBD is quite revealing (Fig. 4, a and b). As reported previously (17Wang Z. Benoit G. Liu J. Prasad S. Aarnisalo P. Liu X. Xu H. Walker N.P. Perlmann T. Nature. 2003; 423: 555-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 18Baker K.D. Shewchuk L.M. Kozlova T. Makishima M. Hassell A. Wisely B. Caravella J.A.

Cell. 2003; 113: 731-742Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), the conventional co-regulator interaction surface (labeled Co-reg in Fig. 4a) is quite different between the two receptors; Nurr1 lacks the hydrophobic groove seen in the TR. However, Nurr1 has an alternative groove adjacent to helix 12 that has a strikingly high hydrophobic potential (colored yellow/orange and labeled Nurr1 specific in Fig. 4b). This surface is formed from the side chains of residues Leu-570 and Phe-574 in helix 10/11 and those of residues Phe-592, Leu-593, Leu-596, and Phe-598 in and just C-terminal to helix 12 (Fig. 4, b and c). For comparison, the largely non-polar region of the LBD surface that mediates heterodimerization with the retinoid X receptor is also indicated (labeled Dim in Fig. 4b). If these residues did contribute to a co-regulator interaction surface, it would explain the finding that mutations in or deletion of helix 12 abolishes the activation activity of the Nurr1 LBD (28Castro D.S. Arvidsson M. Bondesson Bolin M. Perlmann T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37483-37490Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In particular, the mutation of residues Asp-589, Phe-592, and Leu-593, which are largely exposed to solvent on this surface, abolish the activity of the LBD. Together, these findings suggest that this surface might constitute a co-regulator binding surface on the Nurr1 LBD. We wished to determine whether this might be the site of interaction of the CoR peptide. Because the peptide binding was found to quench tryptophan fluorescence, we asked whether either of the two tryptophans in Nurr1 is exposed near this surface. Significantly, Try-482 is partially exposed on the surface of the LBD and is within 7.2 and 10.5 Å of residues Leu-570 and Phe-592, respectively. Mapping the Peptide Binding Surface—To test directly whether this highly hydrophobic patch acts as the binding surface for the CoR peptides, we made mutations (F592A, L593A, and F598A) in this region of Nurr1. We then compared the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of each of these mutants with that of the wild-type LBD and finally correlated the observed perturbations due to the site-directed mutations with those resulting from the binding of the CoR peptide. The HSQC NMR spectra of the 15N-labeled mutants indicate that the mutations perturb the backbone amide signals of between 19 and 48 residues. These perturbations are mostly rather small and are not consistent with any significant disruption of the secondary or tertiary structure of the domain. Thus, we can conclude that the structure and stability of the Nurr1 LBD is unaffected by these predominantly surface mutations. Given the close spatial proximity of the mutated residues to one another, it is not surprising that many signals in the spectra are perturbed by more than one mutation. Furthermore, there is a striking overlap between the signals perturbed by the mutations and those perturbed in the 1:1 complex of the wild-type Nurr1 LBD with the CoR-ID1 peptide. This observation is illustrated for a few specific cases by the expansions of HSQC spectra shown in Fig. 5 and, in a more general way, by the statistics summarized in Fig. 6.Fig. 6Perturbations in the NMR spectra due to mutations in the hydrophobic patch overlap perturbations resulting from peptide binding. For the F592A mutant, 14 resonances are perturbed by the mutation but not by peptide binding (blue), 34 resonances are perturbed by both the mutation and peptide binding (blue/red), and two resonances are perturbed by peptide binding but not by the mutation (red). 124 resonances are not perturbed by either peptide binding or by the mutation. There is very significant overlap between the sets of perturbed residues, supporting the conclusion that the mutated residues are very close to or form part of the peptide binding surface.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In Fig. 5, the colored arrowheads indicate some of the cross-peaks that are perturbed on binding peptide and by at least two of the mutations.

The present study shows that PELP1 does indeed coactivate ER-mediated transcription but also serves as a corepressor of other nuclear hormone receptors (NR)- and non-NR sequence-specific transcription factors tested, including GR, Nur77, AP1, NF-κB, and TCF/SRF. PELP1 expression also retarded the proliferation of mouse fibroblast cell lines in which there was no detectable ER. This was due, at least in part, to the suppressed activation of serum-response genes such as c-fos that in turn resulted from the blocked histone hyperacetylation of nucleosomes containing the c-fos promoter region. The N-terminal leucine-abundant region of PELP1 was observed to interact with HDAC2 and exhibited repressive activity when tethered to the chromatin. In addition, the C-terminal glutamic acid-abundant region bound to the hypoacetylated histones H3 and H4 and prevented them from becoming substrates of histone acetyltransferase. Thus PELP1 promotes and maintains the hypoacetylated state of histones at the target genomic site, and ER binding reverses its role to hyperacetylate histones through an as yet unidentified mechanism.

Eukaryotic chromatin is a highly compact DNA-protein complex composed of an array of nucleosomes. The histone octamer, containing two copies each of histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, provides the protein core of a nucleosome into which the DNA is packaged (1Luger K. Mader A. Richmond R. Sargent D. Richmond T. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6793) Google Scholar). The modulation of chromatin compactness, i.e. chromatin remodeling, is important for rendering transcription factors and the basic transcription machinery accessible to their target gene promoters. Chromatin remodeling can be achieved by at least two enzyme complexes, the histone-modifying enzyme complexes and the ATP-dependent remodeling complexes (2Cress W.D. Seto E. J. Cell.

Many transcriptional coactivators, including GCN5/PCAF, CBP/p300, and NcoA, exhibit intrinsic HAT activity (5Marmorstein R. Roth S.Y. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2001; 11: 155-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), whereas most transcriptional corepressors studied thus far recruit specific HDACs to the chromatin of target genes (5Marmorstein R.

The presence of these divergent complexes of corepressors and HDACs has been surmised to support the specific transcriptional regulation of target genes.Some transcriptional coregulators for NR-mediated transcription, such as ZAC1, NSD1, and RIP14, have been demonstrated to possess dual functions, acting as both coactivators and corepressors (17Cavailles V.

Recently, the nuclear protein PELP1 (proline-, glutamic acid-, and leucine-rich protein 1) has been proposed to be another dual-function coregulator for NR-mediated transcription; i.e. a coactivator for ER and a corepressor for glucocorticoid receptor (GR) (21Vadlamudi R.K. Wang R.-A. Mazumdar A. Kim Y.-S. Shin J. Sahin A. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38272-38279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). PELP1 is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues but more abundantly in neuronal and endocrinal organs such as the brain and the mammary gland. The discovery of up-regulated expression of PELP1 messages in breast cancer tissues underlined the significance of the ER-dependent coactivator function of PELP1 in the tumorigenesis of mammary gland cells.PELP1 possesses 10 putative NR-interacting LXXLL motifs in its N-terminal half, followed by a proline-abundant region and an extremely acidic region containing an unusually long stretch of about 70 glutamic acids at the other side of the protein (21Vadlamudi R.K.

PELP1 does not appear to have intrinsic HAT activity, but it does appear to exert a coactivational activity for ER via binding to both ERα and p300 through its N-terminal region, which contains 10 LXXLL motifs. PELP1 also plays a permissive role in 17β-estradiol (E2)-mediated cell cycle progression via interaction with retinoblastoma protein through its N-terminal 330 amino acids (22Balasenthil S. Vadlamudi R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22119-22127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In addition to the transcriptional coregulator functions for PELP1, it has also been suggested that it plays a nongenomic role, bridging ER and Src tyrosine kinase through its LXXLL and PXXP motifs, respectively (23Wong C.-W. McNally C. Nickbarg E. Komm B.S. Cheskis B.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 14783-14788Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar).In the present study, we report that PELP1 definitely functions as a corepressor of sequence-specific transcription factors, including some NR and non-NR transcription factors such as AP1, TCF/SRF, and NF-κB. Successful transcriptional repression requires both the N-terminal leucine-abundant region (LAR) and the C-terminal glutamic acid-abundant regions (GAR), which are associated with HDAC2 and hypoacetylated core histones, respectively. PELP1 can be considered to belong to a novel class of corepressor, in that it suppresses histone acetylation via active deacetylation, using associated HDAC and masking core histones from HAT-mediated acetylation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDUREScDNA and Plasmids—The full-length cDNA of PELP1 was obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends from the HeLa cell cDNA library; its sequence was confirmed by automatic DNA sequencing, and it was cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI restriction sites of pcDNA3.1 A/His.Myc vector (Invitrogen). Deletion mutants of PELP1 were generated by PCR and subcloned into pcDNA3.1. To express the GAR alone in the nucleus, the portion of PELP1 cDNA encoding for the GAR was subcloned into the XhoI site of pEF/nuc vector (Invitrogen) and modified in order to add six copies of histidine. The INHAT domain of TAF-1β (amino acids 195–277) was amplified by PCR and inserted into the XhoI site at the end of PAR in PELP1ΔGAR. All GAL4 fusion constructs were subcloned into the SalI site of pGH250 that contained GAL4DB. To generate GST-GAR fusion proteins, the cDNA encoding the GAR was subcloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pGEX 4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences). The cDNAs encoding constitutively active calmodulin-dependent kinase IV (CaMK IVc), Nur77, p300, SRC-1, and ERα were obtained from Dr. J. W. Lee (Baylor University) and SRF was from Dr. K. C. Chung (Yonsei University, Korea). Reporter plasmids were obtained from Stratagene with the followings exceptions: pERE-Luc and pNurRE-Luc were gifts from Dr. J. W. Lee; pMMTV-Luc was from Dr. H. Choi (Chonnam University, Korea); and pGH250 and pUAS(G5)-TK-Luc were from Dr. J. H. Ahn (Sungkyunkwan University, Korea). pTK-R-Luc constitutively expressing Renilla luciferase under the thymidine kinase promoter was obtained from Promega Corp.Proteins and Antibodies—Rabbit anti-PELP1 polyclonal antibody was raised against the C-terminal PELP1 peptide (amino acids 1052–1138) and used. Anti-SRF, HDAC2, GAL4DB, p300, CBP, histone H3, and His-probe antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Pan histones antibody MAB3422 (Roche Applied Bioscience), anti-γ-tubulin (Sigma), and anti-acetylhistone H3 and H4 (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) were purchased and used. Purified calf thymus histones H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 were purchased from Roche Applied Bioscience.Cell Culture and Transfection—NIH3T3 and C3H10T1/2 cells (American Type Cell Collection, ATCC) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% calf serum and antibiotics. COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. To establish NIH3T3 and C3H10T1/2 cell lines stably expressing PELP1 and PELP1 lacking the GAR (PELP1ΔGAR), cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-PELP1 and PELP1 ΔGAR by using LipofectAMINE 2000 reagent (Invitrogen), diluted, and grown in complete media in the presence of 500 μg/ml neomycin.Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay—Confluent NIH3T3 cells transfected with expression plasmids encoding PELP1 and SRF were starved for 24 h before stimulation with 10% serum for 1 h, and nuclear extracts of the cells were prepared as described (24Sambrook J. Russell D. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3rd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY2001: 17.20-17.21Google Scholar). Desalted nuclear extracts (8 μg of total protein) were incubated in the presence of 1 ng of radiolabeled SRE oligonucleotide probe (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in binding buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 25% glycerol, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)). For the supershift assay, the nuclear extracts were incubated with 200 ng of appropriate antibodies for 30 min at room temperature and then incubated for 15 min with the probe. Reaction mixtures were electrophoresed on 4% acrylamide gel, dried, and visualized by autoradiography.Reporter Assays—NIH3T3 cells were plated in triplicate at a density of 2 × 104 per well (1.8 cm2) and transfected with either 100 or 200 ng of reporter plasmids, along with the indicated amount of expression plasmids, using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Applied Bioscience). The total amount of plasmids was kept constant by adjustments with empty vector, and 1 ng of pTK-R-Luc was added to the DNA mixtures to monitor the efficiency of the transfections. After stimulation with proper ligands, cells were extracted with passive lysis buffer (Promega Corp.), and firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were assessed using a Dual-Luciferase® reporter assay kit (Promega Corp.). For the pERE-Luc and pMMTV-Luc assays, cells were cultured in phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, stripped with dextran-charcoal for at least 24 h, and then transfected. In experiments using HDAC inhibitors, cells were pretreated with the inhibitors for 5 h before stimulation.Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—Cells were lysed by two cycles of 15-s sonication in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm EDTA) containing protease inhibitor mixture and phosphatase inhibitors. The cell homogenates were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min and incubated with specific antibodies for 16 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were extensively washed four times with immunoprecipitation buffer, separated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were immunoblotted with appropriate antibodies and visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences).In Vitro Binding Assays—Purified GST or GST-GAR proteins (1 μg) were mixed with 2 μg each of histone H2A/H2B complex, H3/H4 complex, or core histone complex in a binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. GST fusion proteins and bound histones were pulled down using glutathione beads, washed extensively with binding buffer containing 150or 300 mm NaCl, and eluted by boiling in the SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (13.5% acrylamide) and visualized by silver staining. For peptide competition or peptide-PELP1 interaction experiments, H3 peptides (amino acids 1–20; ARTKQTARKSTGFKAPRKQL) unacetylated or acetylated on the K9 and/or K14 were purchased (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and used. In another set of experiments, PELP1 and PELP1ΔGAR were translated in vitro in the presence of [35S]methionine using TnT™-T7 coupled reticulocyte lysate (Promega Corp.) and incubated with 5 μg of either H3 or bovine serum albumin for 30 min on ice. Reaction mixtures were then diluted with phosphate-buffered saline and immunoprecipitated using anti-Pan histone antibody. Precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography.RNA Isolation and Semi-quantitative PCR—Total RNA was isolated from NIH3T3 cells using the RNeasy® kit (Qiagen). Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was carried out with 10 ng of RNA using a one-step kit (Qiagen) for an appropriate number of cycles. The following primers were used: a pair of 5′-cgcagagcatcggcagaagg-3′ and 5′-tgagaaggggcagggtgaagg-3′ for c-fos; a pair of 5′-gcctgcacagtgagcctccg-3′ and 5′-agttggcacccactgttaac-3′ for c-jun; and a pair of 5′-gtgaacggatttggccgtattg-3′ and 5′-agtcttctgggtggcagtgat-3′ for gapdh. Equal volumes of PCRs were resolved on 2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining.ChIP Assay—The ChIP assay was carried out according to a protocol optimized for mammalian cells (25Braunstein M. Rose A. Holmes S. Allis C. Broach J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 592-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Briefly, NIH3T3 cells (1 × 106 cells per 10-cm dish), either serum-starved or stimulated, were fixed with 270 μl of 37% formaldehyde for 10 min and extensively washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were extracted in SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, and 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) and sonicated three times by 9-s pulses under the 30% amplitude setting of a Vibra Cell™ (Sonics and Materials Inc.). The extracts were diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer (0.01% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mm EDTA, 16.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, and 167 mm NaCl) and immunoprecipitated with anti-PELP1, anti-SRF, anti-HDAC2, anti-acetyl H3, or H4 antibodies, extensively washed, eluted using 1% SDS and 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate, and incubated at 65 °C for 4 h to reverse the cross-links. DNA fragments in the immune complex were recovered by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation and amplified by quantitative PCR, using two sets of primers specific for the c-fos gene as follows: a pair of 5′-cgtcagcaggtttccacggc-3′ and 5′-gcgcctttatagaagcgctg-3′ for amplification of the immediate downstream of SRE, and another pair of 5′-gtgacacctgagagctggta-3′ and 5′-gaccacctcgacaatgcatg-3′ for amplification of the 3′-end of c-fos gene as a negative control. For the re-ChIP assay, immune complex, which had been eluted in buffer containing 1% SDS and 0.1 m sodium bicarbonate, was diluted in ChIP dilution buffer and then proceeded according to the same ChIP assay protocol as above using the proper antibody. In an experiment for the evaluation of in vivo binding, sonicated extracts of HeLa, MCF-7, or COS-7 cells transfected with plasmid encoding either wild-type or mutant PELP1 were immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-PELP1 antibody according to the ChIP protocol. The immune complexes were separated by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted with anti-histone H3 antibody, and visualized by Lumigen™ TMA-6 reagents (Amersham Biosciences).In Vitro HAT Assay—CBP or p300 immunoprecipitates from 400 μg of HeLa nuclear extracts were incubated with 1 μl (50 μCi/ml) of [14C]acetyl coenzyme A (Amersham Biosciences) and indicated amounts of histone H3 and H4 in a 50-μl reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm sodium butyrate). Purified GST or GST-PELP1GAR was incubated with histones for 30 min before the commencement of the in vitro HAT reaction. The reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and proteins were separated on SDS-PAGE (13% acrylamide) and visualized by fluorography.RESULTSPELP1 Is a Coactivator of ER but Functions as a Corepressor of Other Sequence-specific Transcription Factors—PELP1 has been characterized recently as a coactivator of ERα (21Vadlamudi R.K. Wang R.-A. Mazumdar A. Kim Y.-S. Shin J. Sahin A. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38272-38279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The coregulatory role of PELP1 on transcriptions mediated by other sequence-specific transcription factors including GR, Nur77, NF-κB, AP1, and TCF/SRF was analyzed in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1). NIH3T3 cells express endogenous PELP1 at a low level and exhibit undetectable ER levels (see below). Expression of both ER and increasing amounts of PELP1 in NIH3T3 cells enhanced the E2-induced transactivation of ER-responsive element (ERE) in a dose-dependent manner, as expected (Fig. 1A). On the other hand, expression of PELP1 efficiently repressed dexamethasone-induced transactivation of the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) promoter (Fig. 1B). In addition, the CaMK IVc-induced activation of Nur77-mediated transcription was also repressed by the expression of PELP1 (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, PELP1 successfully repressed the transactivation of reporter genes for non-nuclear hormone receptor transcription factors, including NF-κB, AP1, and TCF/SRF, in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1, D–F). Most interestingly, the basal transcription of the MMTV-Luc, NurRE-Luc, NF-κB-Luc, AP1-Luc, and SRE-Luc reporter genes were also repressed by PELP1, in the absence of proper stimuli (Fig. 1F). However, constitutive expression of the Renilla luciferase gene under the control of the thymidine kinase promoter was affected in no way whatsoever in both the presence and the absence of serum stimuli (Fig. 1G). The dose-dependent expression of PELP1 in the reporter assays was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of all extracts with anti-PELP1 antibody (Fig. 1H and data not shown). These results suggest that PELP1 behaves as a dual-function transcriptional coregulator, i.e. as a corepressor of several sequence-specific transcription factors, but as a coactivator of ER.ERα Inhibits the PELP1-mediated Transcriptional Corepression of SRE—The ER signaling pathway has been implicated in the progression of breast cancer tumorigenesis. As PELP1 functions as an ER coactivator and is expressed at a 3–5 times higher rate in breast tumors than in normal tissues, the role of PELP1 overexpression in hormone-dependent tumor progression also warrants careful consideration (21Vadlamudi R.K. Wang R.-A. Mazumdar A. Kim Y.-S. Shin J. Sahin A. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38272-38279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). For this to be the case, breast cancer cells highly expressing PELP1 should be able to elude or obviate the corepressive activities of PELP1, in order to induce the transcription of SRE that is important in signaling for proliferation. Most interestingly, in the mammary gland cancer cell line, MCF-7, which expressed both endogenous ER and PELP1, serum-induced SRE transcription remained unaffected by the overexpression of PELP1 (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, in a similar fashion to NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 1F), overexpression of PELP1 successfully repressed SRE transcription in an ER-negative cervical epithelial cell line, HeLa, although this repression required a somewhat higher PELP1 level than in the NIH3T3 cells (Fig. 2B). These results indicate that ER may interfere with the corepressive role of PELP1 with regard to SRE transcription. Indeed, the PELP1-mediated transcriptional repression of SRE in the NIH3T3 cells was completely inhibited by ERα coexpression (Fig. 2C). Taken together, it would be that the basic role of PELP1 is to repress the transcriptional activation of several sequence-specific cis-elements, including SRE, and that the binding of ER to PELP1 may modify PELP1 to obtain a coactivator function, albeit by an as yet uncharacterized mechanism. In our study, the biochemical mechanism of PELP1 underlying its signal-dependent transcriptional corepression was further studied, using SRE as the target gene.Fig. 2ERα inhibits the PELP1-mediated transcriptional repression of SRE. A and B, two different epithelial cancer cell lines, MCF-7 (A) and HeLa (B), were transfected with 200 ng of SRE-Luc reporter plasmid and indicated amounts of pcDNA3-PELP1. Cells were starved for 24 h, then stimulated by 10% serum treatment for 7 h, and extracted for reporter assays. C, the same SRE-Luc reporter assay was performed in NIH3T3 cells expressing varying amounts of PELP1 and ERα. Plasmid dose-dependent expression of PELP1 and ERα was confirmed by immunoblotting (right panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Both the LAR and the GAR Are Important for the Corepressor Function of PELP1 in a Full-length Context—To demonstrate that PELP1 is in the SRF complex on SRE, we performed gel mobility shift assays, using a high affinity SRE probe, nuclear extract of NIH3T3 cells ectopically expressing PELP1 and SRF, and antibodies against SRF and PELP1. The anti-PELP1 antibody used in the experiment recognized only PELP1 in the MCF-7 cell extract (Fig. 3A, lane 1), which was confirmed by blocking recognition with the epitope-specific PELP1 peptide (amino acids 1052–1138) (Fig. 3A, lane 2). Although PELP1 does not bind to DNA by itself (21Vadlamudi R.K. Wang R.-A. Mazumdar A. Kim Y.-S. Shin J. Sahin A. Kumar R. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38272-38279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), supershift of the DNA-protein complex band by anti-PELP1 or anti-SRF antibody suggests that PELP1 is able to form a complex with SRF on the SRE probe (Fig. 3B, lanes 4 and 2, respectively). In addition, the recruitment of PELP1 to the endogenous SRE on the c-fos gene in PELP1-expressing NIH3T3 cells was further verified by a ChIP assay using anti-PELP1 antibody (Fig. 3C). Two sets of primers were used to amplify the immediate downstream region of an SRE in the 5′-flanking region (–290 to –21 nt) of the c-fos gene, and also a region in its 3′-flanking region (+2830 to +3169 nt) as a control (Fig. 3C). The region encompassing –290 to –21 nt, but not +2830 to +3169 nt, was prominently amplified from both anti-PELP1 and anti-SRF immunoprecipitates, supporting the conclusion that PELP1 specifically targeted to the promoter region of the c-fos gene (Fig. 3C). In order to confirm further the presence of PELP1 in the SRF complex, PELP1 or SRF immunoprecipitates were subjected to re-ChIP assays, using anti-SRF or anti-PELP1 antibodies, respectively. As shown in Fig. 3D, SRF was detected in PELP1 immunoprecipitates, and PELP1 was detected in SRF immunoprecipitates, indicating that PELP1 does indeed form a complex with SRF on the SRE. Thus, it is expected that the corepressive activity of PELP1 with regard to TCF/SRF-mediated transcription can be achieved in a manner specific to the bound transcription factor.Fig. 3PELP1 is in the SRF complex on SRE. A, specificity of anti-PELP1 antibodies. Endogenous PELP1 in the MCF-7 cell extracts was immunoblotted with rabbit anti-PELP1 antibody in the presence or absence of epitope-specific antigenic peptide (amino acids 1051–1138). B, electrophoresis mobility shift assay using SRE oligonucleotide. Nuclear extracts of NIH3T3 cells, cotransfected with expression plasmids coding for PELP1 and SRF, were incubated with anti-SRF (lane 2), normal rabbit IgG (lane 3), and anti-PELP1 (lane 4) antibodies, and then incubated with the SRE oligonucleotide radiolabeled with [γ-32P]ATP. Radiolabeled bands containing SRE, SRF, and PELP1 (arrowhead), and bands supershifted by antibody against SRF or PELP (arrow) are marked. C, schematic diagram of mouse c-fos gene and ChIP assay. Two regions of DNA subjected to amplification in the ChIP assay were marked with barbell lines at –290 to –21 nt and +2830 to + 3169 nt. Filled square indicates SRE. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with pcDNA3-PELP1 and subjected to the ChIP assay using normal rabbit IgG (n"

Topical and systemic antibiotic treatment is limited by the appearance of resistant bacterial strains. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are gene-encoded ""natural antibiotics"" that form part of the innate mechanism of defense and may be active against such antibiotic-resistant microorganisms. Several microbicidal peptides are expressed in human skin under inflammatory conditions, and their function is not only limited to microbial killing but also influences tissue repair and adaptive immunity. Protein delivery through cutaneous gene therapy is a promising therapeutic tool for both skin and nonskin diseases. Here we present a gene transfer approach aimed at delivering antimicrobial peptides from keratinocytes. Adenoviral vectors encoding antimicrobial peptide genes were used to infect human keratinocytes growing either on plastic or as part of cultured skin equivalents. Inhibition of bacterial growth occurred both in conditioned media and in direct contact with AMPs gene-transduced keratinocytes. In addition, we showed cooperative effects after transfer of combinations of genes encoding for AMPs with structural differences. Combined cutaneous tissue engineering in conjunction with (microbicidal) gene therapy emerges as a tailored therapeutic approach that is useful for wound coverage and, in this case, concomitantly combating infection."
https://openalex.org/W2114958637,"The negative influence of hypoxia on the outcome of malignant tumors may be caused by direct oxygen effects, and potentially, the selection of resistant tumor cells under repetitive hypoxia. To evaluate whether cyclic hypoxia selects for resistant cells and to analyze the underlying mechanisms, the influence of cyclic hypoxia on intracellular death pathways was determined in tumor cells. It could be demonstrated that cyclic hypoxia selects for cells with increased resistance against hypoxia-induced apoptosis. These cells exhibited a cross-resistance against paradigmatic triggers of mitochondrial apoptotic pathways (ionizing radiation/etoposide). In contrast, TRAIL-receptor mediated apoptosis remained unaffected. Thus, cyclic hypoxia selects for cells with defects of the mitochondrial rather than receptor-mediated pathways. Selection of p53-defective cells has been described as a consequence of cyclic hypoxia; therefore, we evaluated the impact of hypoxic selection on activation of p21 and downstream mediators of p53-dependent apoptosis. p53 function and protein levels of key mediators of mitochondrial apoptosis remained unaffected by hypoxic selection. However, radiation-induced conformational changes of Bax were reduced after cyclic hypoxia. In summary, it could be demonstrated that hypoxic stress confers a selection pressure on mitochondrial apoptotic pathways and, consecutively, to an increased resistance toward mitochondrial death triggers."
https://openalex.org/W2021004639,"Previous in vitro studies have established that hormone sensitive lipase (HSL) and adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (AFABP) form a physical complex that presumably positions the FABP to accept a product fatty acid generated during catalysis. To assess AFABP-HSL interaction within a cellular context, we have used lipocytes derived from 293 cells (C8PA cells) and examined physical association using fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Transfection of C8PA cells with cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-HSL, yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-adipocyte FABP, or YFP-liver FABP revealed that under basal conditions each protein was cytoplasmic. In the presence of 20 μm forskolin, CFP-HSL translocated to the triacylglycerol droplet, coincident with BODIPY-FA labeled depots. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis demonstrated that CFP-HSL associated with YFP-adipocyte FABP in both basal and forskolin-treated cells. In contrast, little if any fluorescence resonance energy transfer could be detected between CFP-HSL and YFP-liver FABP. These results suggest that a pre-lipolysis complex containing at least AFABP and HSL exists and that the complex translocates to the surface of the lipid droplet.

Generally described, adipocyte lipolysis involves hormonal activation of protein kinase A that results in the phosphorylation of at least two key proteins, perilipin A, a droplet-associated protein implicated in controlling access of hydrolytic enzymes to the triacylglycerol, and the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), 1The abbreviations used are: HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; FABP, fatty acid-binding protein; AFABP, adipocyte FABP; LFABP, liver FABP; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; PA, perilipin A; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: HSL, hormone-sensitive lipase; CFP, cyan fluorescent protein; YFP, yellow fluorescent protein; FABP, fatty acid-binding protein; AFABP, adipocyte FABP; LFABP, liver FABP; FRET, fluorescence resonance energy transfer; PA, perilipin A; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. believed to be the primary lipase in fat cells responsible for hydrolysis of stored lipid (7Tansey J.

Phosphorylation of perilipin A results in the dynamic restructuring of the lipid droplet, thereby allowing access of the phosphorylated hormone-sensitive lipase to the triacylglycerol substrate (8Tornqvist H.

The adipocyte FABP forms a physical complex with the hormone-sensitive lipase, activating the enzyme by sequestering fatty acids and relieving product inhibition (14Shen W.-J. Sridhar K. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. Proc. Natl. Acad Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5528-5553Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Association between the two proteins has been evaluated in vitro using a combination of yeast two-hybrid analysis, glutathione S-transferase pull downs, and co-immune precipitation as well as deletion and point mutation analysis (14Shen W.-J.

The results of these studies indicated that the adipocyte FABP forms a complex with the amino-terminal domain of HSL (referred to as a docking domain) in a region bounded by amino acids 190–200 of the lipase (16Shen W.-J. Liang Y. Hong R. Patel S. Natu V. Jenkins A. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49443-49448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Docking of AFABP onto the amino-terminal domain of HSL juxtaposes the fatty acid-binding protein adjacent to the catalytic carboxyl-terminal region so as to accept a product fatty acid during triacylglycerol hydrolysis.To explore the specificity of HSL-FABP interaction, isothermal titration microcalorimetry has recently been used (17Jenkins-Kruchten A.E. Bennaars-Eiden A. Ross J.R. Shen W.-J. Kraemer F.B. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 47636-47643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Using isothermal titration microcalorimetry, both the adipocyte and keratinocyte FABPs were shown to associate with HSL in a 1:1 stoichiometry and an affinity in the low nanomolar range (17Jenkins-Kruchten A.E.

In contrast, the intestinal and liver FABP forms, proteins that exhibit the same α-carbon fold as does AFABP but have grossly different amino acid sequences, did not associate to any measurable extent. Moreover, the physical association of adipocyte FABP with HSL required the presence of fatty acids, but due to the experimental design, it was not clear if such fatty acids associate with the FABP or the lipase.The in vitro analysis of FABP association with HSL using purified components does not address many of the regulatory features linked to lipolysis in vivo. For example, it is not clear if the FABP and HSL form a basal complex that co-translocates to the surface of the droplet or if HSL translocates to the droplet, at which time the FABP docks onto the enzyme. Also, it is not clear what role hormone-stimulated phosphorylation of HSL has to play in FABP association; all studies to date have been carried out using non-phosphorylated proteins. To address the first of these questions, we have turned our attention to the use of lipocytes derived from 293 cells overexpressing a combination of fatty acid transport protein 1 and perilipin A as a simple vehicle for assessing FABP-HSL interaction within the cellular context. Because of the high endogenous level of FABP in adipocytes, the surrogate cell line lacking HSL or FABP but having lipid droplets affords the opportunity to study protein-protein interaction as well as translocation in a hormonally sensitive system.

Additionally, Hatch et al. (19Hatch G. Smith A.J. Xu F. Hall A. Bernlohr D.A. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1380-1389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) found that 293 fibroblasts expressing FATP1 exhibit increased oleate and lignocerate influx and that such lipid is preferentially channeled into triacylglycerol. To that end, we stably co-express perilipin A and FATP1 in 293 cells producing lipocytes that accumulate triacylglycerol droplets in defined structures. Into such cells we have transiently expressed fluorescent fusion proteins of CFP-HSL and YFP-FABP and evaluated not only translocation of HSL in response to forskolin stimulation but also physical association between the lipase and FABP by FRET under basal and lipolytic conditions. In this report we find that the adipocyte FABP, but not liver FABP, forms a complex with HSL under basal conditions and that the pre-lipolysis complex co-translocates to the surface of the lipid droplet in the presence of forskolin.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Fatty acids were obtained from Nu-Chek Prep, Inc., Elysian, MN. pcDNA3.1/Zeo, Zeocin, Geneticin, Lipofectamine, and tissue culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. BODIPY D 3835 (4,4-difluoro-5-(2-thienyl)-4-bora-3a,4a-diaza-s-indacene-3-dodecanoic acid) and Alexa Fluor 488 were obtained from Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR. pEYFP-C1 and pECFP-C1 were obtained from Clontech Laboratories, Inc., Palo Alto, CA. Gold Seal glass coverslips for imaging were purchased from Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ. The non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) assay system was purchased from WAKO Chemicals, Richmond, VA. Cholesteryl [1-14C]oleate was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. All other reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.Cloning and Cell Biology—An A206K mutation was introduced into each of the green fluorescent protein derivatives to reduce intrinsic dimerization (20Zacharias D. Violin J. Newton A. Tsien R. Science. 2002; 296: 913-916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar) using the QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis technique of Stratagene Cloning Systems, La Jolla, CA. HSL was then subcloned in-frame into the A206K pECFP-C1 expression vector, whereas AFABP and LFABP were subcloned into A206K pEYFP-C1. Expression of the fusion proteins was confirmed by both the expression of fluorescence in 293 cells and by Western blot analysis. Perilipin A was subcloned into pCDNA3.1/Zeo and expression in 293 cells confirmed by Western blot analysis. All cloning was verified by DNA sequencing.Generation of C8PA Lipocytes—Perilipin A, subcloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo, was linearized and introduced into 293 cells stably expressing FATP1 (C8 cells) by electroporation according to the manufacturer's instructions (BTX division of Genetronics, Inc., San Diego, CA). Dilutions of the electroporated cells were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum onto surfaces pretreated with 25 μg/ml of poly-l-lysine to enhance attachment and incubated at 37 °C, 5% CO2. After 48 h, selection was initiated with the addition of 300 μg/ml Zeocin for expression of perilipin A and 400 μg/ml of Geneticin for expression of FATP1. Individual lines were developed and analyzed immunochemically for perilipin A expression using a goat anti-perilipin A antibody (9Sztalryd C. Xu G. Dorward H. Tansey J.T. Contreras J.A. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1093-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) and/or FATP1 expression using an anti-FATP1 antibody (19Hatch G. Smith A.J. Xu F. Hall A. Bernlohr D.A. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1380-1389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A stable cell line expressing perilipin A and FATP1 (referred to as C8PA) was selected and maintained on 300 μg/ml Zeocin and 400 μg/ml Geneticin during the course of all studies. C8PA cells for all experiments were plated onto surfaces pretreated with 25 μg/ml of poly-l-lysine.Immunocytochemistry—C8PA cells plated on 13-mm glass coverslips and incubated in 300 μm oleic acid, 100 μm fatty acid-free BSA were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 25 °C. The cells were rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) containing 0.01% digitonin and incubated for 2 h at 25 °C in blocking buffer containing 0.01 m phosphate, 5% goat serum, 5% glycerol, 1.0% cold water fish gelatin, and 0.01% digitonin. The cells were subsequently incubated overnight at 4 °C in a 1:500 dilution of goat-anti-perilipin antibody (9Sztalryd C. Xu G. Dorward H. Tansey J.T. Contreras J.A. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1093-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) in PBS containing 0.01% digitonin. After washing in PBS with 0.01% digitonin, the coverslips were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C in a 1:400 dilution of Alexa Fluor 488 (2 mg/ml) donkey anti-goat IgG in PBS with 0.01% digitonin. After washing, the coverslips were incubated at 25 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with BODIPY D3835 (10 μg/ml), then washed with PBS, mounted, and visualized for perilipin or fat droplets by confocal microscopy.Confocal Microscopy—Preparations were viewed using a Bio-Rad MRC-1024 confocal microscope attached to a Nikon Diaphot inverted microscope (Bio-Rad) equipped with a 15-millwatt krypton/argon laser. Excitation filters allowing 488 and 568 nm were used sequentially to visualize the Alexa 488 and BODIPY probes, respectively. The samples were viewed using either a 20×, 0.75 n.a. plan apo or a 40×, 1.0 n.a. plan apo objective. Digital images were collected using LaserSharp version 3.2 software (Bio-Rad). Stored digital images were analyzed using Image Pro Plus Version 4.5 software (Media Cybernetics, Silver Spring, MD 20910).Lipolysis in C8PA Cells—For in situ lipolysis, C8PA cells were loaded with lipid to maximize droplet formation by a 48-h incubation with 300 μm oleic acid complexed to 100 μm fatty acid-free BSA. After loading with fatty acids, the cells were washed 2 times with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated either with or without 20 μm forskolin in Krebs-Ringers Hepes buffer (pH 7.4) with 2% BSA and 5% glucose for 4 h (18Souza S.C. Muliro K. Liscum L. Lien P. Yamamoto M.T. Schaffer J.E. Dalla G.E. Wang X. Kraeme F.B. Obin M. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 8267-8272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Media was withdrawn at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 h and assayed for non-esterified fatty acids.Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer—For FRET analysis C8PA cells were plated onto 13-mm coverslips placed into 12-well dishes. At ∼70% confluence wells were transfected with expression plasmids specific for CFP-HSL and/or YFP-FABP. 24 h later cells were lipid-loaded with 300 μm oleic acid, 100 μm BSA to maximize droplet formation. Lipolytic conditions were initiated by the addition of 20 μm forskolin, and digital images for FRET were captured after 4 h.During microscopy cells were kept in media plus 10% fetal bovine serum at room temperature. Digital images were collected using a Roper CoolSnap HQ 12 bit monochrome camera and captured to a Pentium IV 2.6 GHz personal computer using Image Pro Plus version 4.5 software (Media Cybernetics) for microscope automation and image analysis on a Nikon Eclipse E800 photomicroscope. Images were captured with a 40×, 0.75 n.a. plan fluor or a 60×, 1.40 n.a. plan apo objective. Cells with relatively equal levels of expression were selected for imaging. For detection of CFP-HSL, cells were viewed with an excitation filter of 436/20 nm, a dichroic beam splitter of 455 nm, and an emission filter of 480/40 nm. YFP-FABP was detected by using a filter set with an excitation filter of 500/25 nm, a dichroic beam splitter of 515 nm, and an emission filter of 535/30 nm. The filters for FRET were an excitation filter of 436/20 nm, a dichroic beam splitter of 455 nm, and an emission filter of 535/50 nm. Filters were obtained from the Chroma Technology (Brattleboro, VT). Images were acquired using 2 × 2 binning mode and 100–250-ms integration times on the camera. The exposure times were equal within each series of images and were chosen so that all pixel intensities were within the linear range of the camera. Images were first background-subtracted and registered to ensure accurate pixel alignment. The CFP-HSL image was then thresholded, changing the intensities of all pixels outside of the cell to zero. Thresholding was based on the CFP-HSL image because it had the largest signal-to-noise ratio, providing the clearest distinction between the cell and background. The thresholded CFP-HSL image was used to generate a binary image with all values within the cell = 1 and all outside = 0. The FRET and YFP-FABP images were multiplied by the binary image, ensuring that the same pixels were analyzed in all three images as described in detail (21Chamberlain C.E. Kraynov V.S. Hahn K.M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 389-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Emission appearing in the FRET image because of emission from CFP-HSL or direct excitation of YFP-FABP was removed by subtracting a fraction of the CFP-HSL and YFP-FABP images from the FRET image. This fraction depended on the filter set and exposure condition used and was determined as described (21Chamberlain C.E. Kraynov V.S. Hahn K.M. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 325: 389-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Corrected FRET was calculated on a pixel-by-pixel basis for the entire image using: corrected FRETC = FRET - (0.50 × CFP-HSL) - (0.02 × YFP-FABP), where FRET, CFP-HSL, and YFP-FABP correspond to background-subtracted images of cells co-expressing CFP-HSL and YFP-FABP acquired through the FRET, CFP, and YFP channels, respectively. 0.50 and 0.02 are the fractions of bleed-through of CFP and YFP fluorescence, respectively, through the FRET filter channel. Controls were performed in which images were obtained in different orders. The order in which images were obtained had no effect. For presentation, a low pass filter kernel was applied to the corrected FRET image to remove high frequency noise (22Castleman K. Digital Image Processing. Prentice-Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ1996: 207-209Google Scholar). Images were contrast stretched, pseudocolored, and formatted for display using Adobe Photoshop 7.0 software (Adobe Systems, Mountain View, CA).HSL Activity Assay—Plasmids directing the expression of either HSL or CFP-HSL were transiently transfected into 293 cells, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and harvested into 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCL, 0.1 mm EDTA (pH 7) with 20 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml antipain, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin. The extract was sonicated at 30% power 3 times for 30 s each on ice using a Misonix Sonicator XL. The homogenate was centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min, and the supernatant was used in the assays. Substrate preparation and assay conditions were as previously described (23Osterlund T. Danielsson B. Degerman E. Contreras J.A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Holm C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Briefly, for 4 ml of substrate 0.45 mm cholesteryl oleate, 1.4 mg of phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylinositol (3:1, w/w), and 0.9 μCi/ml cholesteryl [14C]oleate were mixed and dried under nitrogen. The dried substrate was emulsified by adding 1 ml of 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and sonicated 2 × 1 min in a Branson 2510 water bath sonicator. The addition of 3 ml of buffer followed by sonicating 4 × 30 s emulsified the substrate. For reactions, 100 μl of substrate is mixed with 50 μl of enzyme at 37 °C and the production of fatty acids was measured after 30 min as described (23Osterlund T. Danielsson B. Degerman E. Contreras J.A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Holm C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).RESULTSPreviously we have reported the development of fibroblastic cells stably expressing fatty acid transport protein 1 (19Hatch G. Smith A.J. Xu F. Hall A. Bernlohr D.A. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 1380-1389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Such cells, termed C8 cells, exhibit increased transport of long chain fatty acids and accumulate triacylglycerols. However, triacylglycerol accumulated by C8 cells was disorganized and appeared rather diffusely distributed within the cell based on oil red O staining. Greenberg and co-workers (18Souza S.C. Muliro K. Liscum L. Lien P. Yamamoto M.T. Schaffer J.E. Dalla G.E. Wang X. Kraeme F.B. Obin M. Greenberg A.S. J. Biol.

Kimmel A. Londos C. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8401-8406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) have reported that perilipin A, the key droplet-associated protein in fat cells, organizes the lipid into well defined structures and provides hormonal competence. To that end we stably transfected C8 cells with perilipin A (PA) to produce a cell line termed C8PA that not only transported fatty acids and synthesized triacylglycerol but organized said lipid into well defined droplets. Fig. 1A shows the oil red O staining of C8PA cells after a 48 h “load” in which FA·BSA (3:1) was incubated in the medium to provide substrate for FATP1. We refer to such lipid filled C8PA cells as lipocytes.Adipose tissue in vivo as well as cultured adipocytes exhibits cAMP-dependent activation of lipolysis and increases free fatty acid release from cells (1Londos C. Brasaemle D.L. Schultz C.J. Adler-Wailes S.C. Levin D.M. Kimmel A.R. Rondinone C.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 892: 155-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). To assess the lipolytic capacity of C8PA cells, we incubated cells with 20 μm forskolin for 4 h and evaluated fatty acid release from the cells. As shown in Fig. 1B, forskolin stimulated a 2-fold increase in fatty acid release from C8PA lipocytes in a process that was linear for at least 4 h. Although this 2-fold stimulation is significantly less than fatty acid release from cultured adipocytes (24Tansey J.T. Sztalryd C. Gruia-Gray J. Roush D.L. Zee J.V. Gavrilova O. Reitman M.L. Deng C.-X. Li C. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 6494-6499Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), it does demonstrate that the cultured lipocytes are lipolytically competent at low levels albeit in the absence of HSL. Similar results were obtained when cells were treated with 1 mm dibutyryl-cAMP (results not shown), but the magnitude of the increase was not as robust. Therefore, forskolin stimulation was adopted as standard conditions.Lipolytic stimulation of cultured adipocytes results in a dramatic restructuring of the droplet surface and a reorganization of the local droplet environment (8Tornqvist H. Krabisch L. Belfrage P. J. Lipid Res. 1972; 13: 424-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Sztalryd C. Xu G. Dorward H. Tansey J.T. Contreras J.A. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1093-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). To assess the organizational structure of the lipid droplets in C8PA lipocytes, the cells were incubated for 2 h with BODIPY-oleate, and the fluorescent fatty acid was accumulated into droplets. As shown in Fig. 2, under basal conditions, BODIPY-oleate accumulated into small droplets organized into a central cluster. When visualized with transmitted light differential interference contrast (Fig. 2A), the droplets appear as a central tight cluster of droplets, whereas by fluorescence (Fig. 2C), the clustered nature of the organization of smaller droplets was clear. After forskolin stimulation, the clustered droplets were dramatically restructured, as revealed by both differential interference contrast (Fig. 2B) and BODIPY-oleate fluorescence (Fig. 2D). Moreover, consistent with previous studies (9Sztalryd C. Xu G. Dorward H. Tansey J.T. Contreras J.A. Kimmel A.R. Londos C. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 161: 1093-1103Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar) perilipin A was found on the droplets coincident with the fluorescent lipid localization (Figs. 2, E and F).Fig. 2Fluorescence analysis of C8PA cells. BODIPY-oleate-loaded C8PA cells under basal (A) or with 20 μm forskolin (B) are shown as analyzed using differential interference contrast imaging. Fluorescent images of the BODIPY-oleate-loaded C8PA cells are shown under basal (C) conditions or with 20 μm forskolin (D). Immunofluorescence localization is shown of perilipin A in C8PA cells (E) overlaid onto an image of the same field showing localization of the neutral lipid after incubation with BODIPY-oleate (F). The scale bar on panel D is 10 μm and represents the image size for panels A–D. The scale bar on the inset for panel D is 25 μm and represents the image size for each inset in panels A–D. The scale bar in panel F is 5 μm and represents the images in panels E and F.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Using the C8PA lipocyte cell model, we addressed the location and translocation of adipocyte FABP and HSL by immunofluorescence using fluorescent fusion proteins. Previous studies show that fusion proteins with adipocyte FABP are fully active for fatty acid binding as well as association with HSL (14Shen W.-J. Sridhar K. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. Proc. Natl.

The cells were harvested and assayed for neutral cholesteryl-oleate activity. Control 293 cells transfected with vector alone exhibit no activity, verifying that these cells have little endogenous neutral cholesteryl esterase activity (Fig. 3). CFP-HSL and native HSL have significantly increased activity over vector-transfected cells and show similar levels of activity. CFP-HSL, therefore, maintains its neutral cholesteryl esterase activity as compared with HSL.Fig. 3Activity of CFP-HSL. Expression plasmids encoding either HSL or CFP-HSL were transiently transfected into 293 cells, and the cholesteryl esterase activity in extracts was determined as described.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Transient transfection of C8PA cells with CFP-HSL revealed that the fusion protein was broadly distributed within the cytoplasm but excluded from organelles and nuclei (Fig. 4A). When C8PA cells were stimulated with forskolin, some but not all CFP-HSL was reorganized and coalesced into a structure coincident with the droplet surface Fig. 4B). To demonstrate that the structure CFP-HSL translocated to is the droplet surface, the fluorescence of BODIPY-oleate staining of the droplets was compared with that of CFP-HSL. As shown in Fig. 4, E and F, CFP-HSL translocation resulted in association with BODIPY-FA-labeled droplets. As such, the C8PA lipocyte system reproduces that exhibited by true adipocytes. It should be noted that these studies do not address the molecular organization"
https://openalex.org/W2089122195,"Methyl-CpG-binding domain proteins 2 and 3 (MBD2 and MBD3) are transcriptional repressors that contain methyl-CpG binding domains and are components of a CpG-methylated DNA binding complex named MeCP1. Methyl-CpG-binding protein 3-like 1 (MBD3L1) is a protein with substantial homology to MBD2 and MBD3, but it lacks the methyl-CpG binding domain. MBD3L1 interacts with MBD2 and MBD3 in vitro and in yeast two-hybrid assays. Gel shift experiments with a CpG-methylated DNA probe indicate that recombinant MBD3L1 can supershift an MBD2-methylated DNA complex. In vivo, MBD3L1 associates with and colocalizes with MBD2 but not with MBD3 and is recruited to 5-methylcytosine-rich pericentromeric heterochromatin in mouse cells. In glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays MBD3L1 is found associated with several known components of the MeCP1·NuRD complex, including HDAC1, HDAC2, MTA2, MBD2, RbAp46, and RbAp48, but MBD3 is not found in the MBD3L1-bound fraction. MBD3L1 enhances transcriptional repression of methylated DNA by MBD2. The data are consistent with a role of MBD3L1 as a methylation-dependent transcriptional repressor that may interchange with MBD3 as an MBD2-interacting component of the NuRD complex. MBD3L1 knockout mice were created and were found to be viable and fertile, indicating that MBD3L1 may not be essential or there is functional redundancy (through MBD3) in this pathway.

Overall, this study reveals additional complexities in the mechanisms of transcriptional repression by the MBD family proteins. Mammalian genomes encode several proteins that can bind specifically to methylated CpG sequences, providing one mechanism by which DNA methylation has the capacity to inhibit gene expression (1Wade P.A.

MBD2 is highly similar to MBD3 except for the additional N-terminal glycine arginine-rich repeat region of 140 amino acids, which is not found in MBD3 (8Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). There are two translated protein products of MBD2 mRNA, MBD2a and MBD2b. MBD2b is the shorter version lacking the N-terminal 140 amino acids due to usage of a different initiation codon. The recombinant MBD2b protein has been reported to remove 5-methylcytosine residues from DNA through a DNA demethylase activity (17Bhattacharya S.K. Ramchandani S. Cervoni N. Szyf M. Nature. 1999; 397: 579-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), although this finding has not been repeated yet by other laboratories (11Ng H.-H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A. Turner B.M.

Transcriptional repression by MBD2 is, at least for certain promoters, sensitive to the histone deacetylase inhibitor trichostatin A (11Ng H.-H. Zhang Y. Hendrich B. Johnson C.A. Turner B.M.

In cotransfection experiments, MBD2b increases transcriptional repression with methylated reporter constructs (16Boeke J. Ammerpohl O. Kegel S. Moehren U. Renkawitz R. J. Biol.

Recent evidence indicates that MBD2 is the methyl CpG-binding protein of a larger complex named MeCP1, a methylated DNA binding complex identified earlier in the laboratory of Adrian Bird (11Ng H.-H.

Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar). MBD3 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed in most mouse and human tissues. There are several splice variants of MBD3 including some that encode a non-functional MBD domain. Mammalian variants of MBD3 do not bind to methylated DNA in vitro (8Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar, 18Wade P.A. Gegonne A. Jones P.L. Ballestar E. Aubry F. Wolffe A.P. Nat.

However, Xenopus and zebrafish MBD3 proteins can bind to methylated DNA, most likely due to an amino acid difference in the MBD domain (1Wade P.A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3166-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). NuRD/Mi-2 is a multisubunit repressor complex that contains nucleosome remodeling and histone deacetylase activities (22Xue Y. Wong J. Moreno G.T. Young M.K. Cote J. Wang W. Mol.

The histone deacetylases HDAC1 and HDAC2 and the histone-binding proteins RbAp46 and RbAp48 form a core complex shared between the NuRD- and Sin3-histone deacetylase complexes. MBD3 was found to be a subunit of the NuRD complex, thus establishing another potential link between DNA methylation and transcriptional repression (20Zhang Y. Ng H.H. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Bird A. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1924-1935Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar, 21Saito M. Ishikawa F. J. Biol.

Biol. 1998; 8: 843-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The MeCP1 complex contains 10 major polypeptides including MBD2 and all of the known NuRD components (26Feng Q. Zhang Y. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 827-832PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, NuRD may be an important mediator between DNA methylation and gene silencing. In mammals, the MBD3-containing NuRD complex can be targeted to methylated DNA by MBD2 (26Feng Q. Zhang Y. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 827-832PubMed Google Scholar). Recently we have identified and cloned MBD3L1 and MBD3L2, two proteins with homology to MBD2 and MBD3 (27Jiang C.L. Jin S.G. Lee D.H. Lan Z.J. Xu X. O'Connor T.R. Szabo P.E. Mann J.R. Cooney A.J. Pfeifer G.P. Genomics. 2002; 80: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). MBD3L1 is expressed at low levels in pancreas and at higher levels in testis, specifically in round spermatids. Given their homology with MBD3/MBD2, it is likely that these two proteins may play an important role in transcriptional gene silencing or regulation of silencing and may be involved in pathways of transcriptional repression by CpG-methylated DNA. Here we have characterized the biological function of MBD3L1 using biochemical and genetic approaches. Cell Culture and Transfection—AD293, 293T, HeLa, NIH3T3, and COS7 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 standard incubator. DNA transfections were carried out in Opti-MEM-I medium (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine or Lipofectamine-Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cloning of Human MBD3L1—A search of the human EST data base using the amino acid sequences of MBD2 and MBD3 as a query revealed several human EST clones, including AW263178. The full-length cDNA for MBD3L1 was PCR-amplified from clone AW263178 and from mouse testis RNA by reverse transcription-PCR (GenBank™ accession numbers AY038022 and AY038023) (27Jiang C.L. Jin S.G. Lee D.H. Lan Z.J. Xu X. O'Connor T.R. Szabo P.E. Mann J.R. Cooney A.J. Pfeifer G.P. Genomics. 2002; 80: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Human MBD3L1 was used for all experiments described here. Plasmids—Most cDNA clones were obtained by reverse transcription-PCR and confirmed by DNA sequencing. For the yeast two-hybrid assay, full-length human MBD3L1, MBD2b, MBD2t, and MBD3 cDNA sequences were cloned in-frame into the pAS2–1 (bait) or pACT2 (prey) vectors. For expression of the recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli, the cDNAs of MBD2b, MBD3, and MBD3L1 were subcloned into the pET28a His-tag vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). Full-length MBD3L1 was cloned into the pGEX-5X-1 GST expression vector (Amersham Biosciences). The deletion constructs of His-tagged MBD2b (1–82, 1–210, 27–82, and 201–262 amino acids) and GST-fused MBD3L1 (1–48, 1–103, 49–103, 49–146, 104–146, 104–194, 141–194, and 161–194 amino acids) were created in the same vectors. For the expression of recombinant proteins in mammalian cells, full-length MBD3L1 was cloned into pEBG, a mammalian GST expression vector. The cDNAs of MBD3L1, MBD2a, and MBD3 were subcloned into pCMV-Tag1 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) in-frame with FLAG and Myc epitopes (FLAG-MBD3L1, MBD2a-Myc, and MBD3-Myc). For fluorescence localization studies, MBD3L1, MBD2b, and MBD2a were cloned into pEGFP-C2 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and pDsRED-C2 (Clontech). Yeast Two-hybrid Assay—The PG69–4a yeast strain was co-transformed with bait and prey plasmids using the lithium acetate transformation procedure (Clontech). The transformants were cultured on high stringency plates, SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp. The resultant clones were tested for β-galactosidase activity using the colony-lift method, as described by the manufacturer (Clontech). Protein Expression—Plasmids were transformed into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) for expression. Expression and purification of His-tagged proteins was done based on the Qiagen handbook (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). GST fusion proteins were purified with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Biosciences). GST fusion proteins bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads were kept in storage buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 10% v/v glycerol) for the protein binding assays. They were eluted from the beads with elution buffer (75 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm reduced glutathione, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100). Purified proteins were dialyzed against 70 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50% v/v glycerol. In Vitro Protein Binding Assay—2 μg of GST or GST-MBD3L1 protein was bound to glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, and the slurry was incubated with the same amount of His-tagged proteins in 250 μl of binding buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml BSA) at 4 °C for 3 hours. After washing the beads 3 times with binding buffer, the bound proteins were eluted with SDS gel loading buffer, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to a membrane, and detected with an anti-His antibody (Amersham Biosciences). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—The plasmid pCG11 and anti-MBD2 serum (S923) were gifts from Dr. Adrian P. Bird (University of Edinburgh, UK). The CG11 oligonucleotide containing 27 CpG sites has been described (19Meehan R.R. Lewis J.D. McKay S. Kleiner E.L. Bird A.P. Cell. 1989; 58: 499-507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). CG11 was excised from the pCG11 plasmid and was methylated in vitro using SssI DNA methylase (to produce the oligonucleotide MCG11). Binding reactions for the mobility shift assay were performed in binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 3 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5% glycerol) containing 400 ng of sonicated E. coli genomic DNA. Approximately 100 ng of recombinant MBD2b protein was preincubated with different amounts of MBD3L1 protein (25, 50, 150 ng) on ice for 20 min, and then end-labeled CG11 or MCG11 probes were added, and the mixture was incubated for another 20 min on ice. The complex was electrophoresed through 5% polyacrylamide gels in 0.25× Tris-buffered EDTA containing 3% glycerol at 4 °C. In Vivo GST Pull-down Assay—The pEBG (empty vector) and the GST-MBD3L1 constructs were transiently transfected into AD293 cells using Lipofectamine-Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight hours after transfection cells were lysed, incubated with glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), and washed as described (28Kiefer S.M. McDill B.W. Yang J. Rauchman M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 14869-14876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The bound proteins were eluted in SDS gel loading buffer, separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to a membrane, and detected with antibodies against components of the NuRD complex. Anti-HDAC1 (Santa Cruz, H-51), anti-HDAC2 (Santa Cruz, H-54), anti-RbAp46 (Santa Cruz, N-19), anti-RbAp48 (Santa Cruz, N-19), anti-MTA1 (Santa Cruz, A-18), anti-MTA2 (ProSci Inc.), anti-p66 (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-Sin3A (Santa Cruz, AK-11), and anti-Mi2 (Upstate Biotechnology) were obtained from commercial sources. Anti-MBD2 and anti-MBD3 antibodies were kindly provided by Paul A. Wade (Emory University) and Fuyuki Ishikawa (Kyoto University), respectively. Immunofluorescence Studies—NIH3T3 cells were grown on glass coverslips and transfected with pEGFP-MBD3L1, pDsRED-MBD2a, and MBD3-Myc. Cells were incubated for 48 h and were then washed twice with cold PBS. Cells were fixed in 3.7% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min at room temperature and were then washed with PBS. Cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and incubated in blocking buffer (PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.2% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature. Rabbit anti-Myc (Santa Cruz, A-14; 2 μg/ml) was added in blocking buffer and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Cells were washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20 for 5 min each. Rhodamine-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Santa Cruz; 1 μg/ml) was added to the cells and incubated in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature followed by 3 washes as above. Nuclear counterstaining was performed with 0.2 μg/ml 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) in PBS for 5 min. The cells were washed five times with PBS, mounted with Fluoromount G (Southern Biotechnology Associates, Birmingham, AL), and visualized with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus IX81). Luciferase Assays—We used pM1Luc (Roche Applied Science) as the luciferase reporter vector, which contains the firefly luciferase gene driven by a CMV promoter. pM1Luc was methylated in vitro using SssI DNA methylase as described by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). 293T cells were seeded into 24-well plates at 2.2× 105 per well one day before transfection. A total of 120 ng of plasmid DNA including 20 ng of reporter construct, 2.5 ng of internal control Renilla luciferase vector (pRL-CMV, Promega, Madison, WI), and different amounts of effector plasmids (from 20 to 100 ng) was used for each transfection using Lipofectamine-Plus (Invitrogen) as the transfection reagent. The pCMV-Tag1 vector was used to normalize the total DNA content of the transfections. All transfections were carried out in at least three independent experiments and in triplicate. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were assayed with the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) following the instructions of the manufacturer, and the firefly luciferase activities were normalized relative to Renilla luciferase expression. Gene Targeting—The MBD3L1 gene-targeting vector was designed to replace exon 3 of the mouse MBD3L1 gene, which encodes the entire open reading frame, with a PgK-neo cassette. The knockout vector was made by high fidelity PCR with the proofreading-capable Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and 129/SvImJ mouse ES cell DNA as the template. The PgK-neo cassette was flanked by 0.8 kilobases of upstream genomic MBD3L1 sequence and 5 kilobases of downstream sequence in the pKO Scrambler V924 cloning vector (Lexicon Genetics). The resultant construct replaces exon 3 of MBD3L1 with the 1.8-kb PgK-neo cassette, leaving only the 7 N-terminal codons of the MBD3L1 gene intact. Gene targeting was performed in the ES cell line 129S3/SvImJ by the Transgenic Mouse Facility (City of Hope). Correctly targeted clones were identified by Southern blotting using external and internal probes. Genotyping—A small piece of mouse tails was digested in 200 μlof50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, 20 mm EDTA, 0.45% Tween 80, 0.45% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K overnight at 56 °C. The digested sample was diluted in sterile water. The diluted sample was denatured in boiling water for 5 min, and 2 μl was used for the PCR reaction. The primer sets for PCR genotyping included primers MBD3L1L5 (5′-GTGTTAAAACAAGACCATGCCCCATTT-3′), MBD3L1U1 (5′-CACTTCAGACCTTGCCAAGACT), and BPAU1 (5′-GATTGGGAAGACAATAGCAGGCA). MBD3L1L5 is in a downstream genomic fragment of the MBD3L1-targeting vector, MBD3L1U1 is in the replaced exon of MBD3L1, and BPAU1 is in the neo cassette. MBD3L1L5 and MBD3L1U1 will give a 380-bp fragment, which is the wild-type allele. MBD3L1L5 and BPAU1 will give a 276-bp fragment, which is the targeted locus. PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 45 s, for a total of 34 cycles. Reverse Transcription-PCR—RNA was isolated from mouse tissues by the RNAzol method. The first strand cDNA synthesis was carried out with ThermoScript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) following the instructions of the manufacturer. For the PCR, primers for MBD3L1 and GAPDH were the same as described previously (27Jiang C.L. Jin S.G. Lee D.H. Lan Z.J. Xu X. O'Connor T.R. Szabo P.E. Mann J.R. Cooney A.J. Pfeifer G.P. Genomics. 2002; 80: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). For the MBD2a/b transcript, primers 5′-TCCAAGTGGTAAGAAGTTCAGAAG-3′ (upper) and 5′-CTTGTTCTGATTGAGGGGGTCA-3′ (lower) were used; for the MBD2t transcript, the primers were 5′-TTCCGGCTCATTAAGAAGCAGAC-3′ (upper) and 5′-ATGCCATGTTGCGGGTGAAGC-3′ (lower); for the MBD3 gene, upper primer and lower primers were 5′-GCTGGGAAAGGGAAGAAGTGC-3′ and 5′-GTGTGTAGAGCACTCGCAATG-3′, respectively. For MBD3L2, the primers were 5′-CAGAAGAGAAGAGAGACCCAGATTGTCC-3′ and 5′-CTTCTCCAGGAGTAAGCTGACCCTTAA-3′. The PCR was carried out at 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 40 s, 72 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 5 min for 35 cycles (MBD3L1, MBD3L2, and MBD2) or 28 cycles (GAPDH). For MBD3, the PCR was carried out for 35 cycles at 98 °C for 45 s, 58 °C for 45 s, 72 °C for 60 s, and 72 °C for 5 min, with 5% (v/v) Me2SO in the PCR reaction. Among the family of human methyl-CpG binding domain proteins, MBD2 and MBD3 are the most closely related. We previously reported the identification of two mammalian homologues of MBD2 and MBD3, which we named MBD3L1 and MBD3L2 (27Jiang C.L. Jin S.G. Lee D.H. Lan Z.J. Xu X. O'Connor T.R. Szabo P.E. Mann J.R. Cooney A.J. Pfeifer G.P. Genomics. 2002; 80: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). MBD3L1 is expressed at low levels in pancreas and at higher levels in testis, specifically in post-meiotic haploid cells and has been shown to act as a transcriptional repressor (27Jiang C.L. Jin S.G. Lee D.H. Lan Z.J. Xu X. O'Connor T.R. Szabo P.E. Mann J.R. Cooney A.J. Pfeifer G.P. Genomics. 2002; 80: 621-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Both MBD3L1 and MBD3L2 lack the MBD domain but all four proteins contain a coiled-coil domain near the C terminus (Fig. 1). The longer form of MBD2 contains an N-terminal glycine-arginine-rich repeat, which is absent from the shorter form, MBD2b. A truncated form of MBD2, termed MBD2t, is expressed in testis. However, it is not clear if this isoform has a biological function. The presence of coiled-coil domains in MBD2, MBD3, and MBD3L1 suggested that these proteins may have the potential to heterodimerize through this type of motif, which is often involved in protein-protein interactions. To test interactions between MBD3L1 and MBD2 and MBD3, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid analysis (Fig. 2A). The sequences were cloned into the GAL4 activation domain and GAL4 binding domain vectors, respectively. For MBD2, we used MBD2b as well as the testis-specific variant, MBD2t. Two-hybrid interactions were observed between MBD2b and MBD3, which confirms a previous report (29Tatematsu K.I. Yamazaki T. Ishikawa F. Genes Cells. 2000; 5: 677-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Binding between MBD2 and MBD3 may form the basis for the recruitment of a larger transcriptional repressor complex containing MBD3 to methylated DNA, since mammalian MBD3 alone cannot bind to CpG-methylated DNA (1Wade P.A. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 3166-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar, 8Hendrich B. Bird A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6538-6547Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar, 21Saito M. Ishikawa F. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35434-35439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). When MBD3L1 was present in the activation domain vector, it interacted with MBD2b and MBD3 and with itself. However, when MBD3L1 was present in the DNA binding domain vector, a significant interaction was observed only with MBD3 and with itself (Fig. 2A). No interaction was seen between MBD3L1 and the testis-specific variant MBD2t. We then tested if MBD3L1 can interact with MBD2 or MBD3 in vitro (Fig. 2B). GST-tagged MBD3L1 was expressed in E. coli. After binding of the protein to glutathione-Sepharose beads, the beads were incubated with recombinant His-tagged MBD3 or MBD2b. A significant interaction of MBD3L1 was observed with both proteins. To identify the domains in MBD3L1 that are required for interaction with MBD2, we incubated His-tagged MBD2b with GST-fused deletion constructs of MBD3L1 (Fig. 3). We found that two domains of MBD3L1 had the capacity to interact with MBD2b. These two domains included amino acids spanning the N-terminal part of the protein (amino acids 1–48 and amino acids 49–103). The data indicate that the coiled-coil domain present in MBD3L1 was not required for the interaction. We also mapped the domains on MBD2b, which are required for binding to MBD3L1 and MBD3, respectively (Fig. 4). Since MBD2a is identical to MBD2b except for an N-terminal extension, the MBD3L1-binding domain(s) in MBD2a are expected to be identical to those in MBD2b. The C-terminal region of MBD2b (amino acids 201–262, which forms the coiled-coil domain) was capable of binding to MBD3L1 in vitro (Fig. 4A). The same region of MBD2b was involved in binding to MBD3 (Fig. 4B). However, the fragment 1–210 (but not 1–82) also bound to MBD3. Thus, MBD3L1 and MBD3 bind to overlapping regions near the C terminus of MBD2 via its coiled-coil domain. To obtain further evidence that MBD3L1 can interact with MBD2, we conducted gel mobility shift assays with a CpG-methylated DNA probe (Fig. 5). MBD3L1 alone did not bind to methylated DNA. His-tagged MBD2b produced a gel-retarded complex with the methylated probe but not with the unmethylated probe. Upon the addition of recombinant MBD3L1 to the MBD2b reaction, several supershifted bands appeared in a co"
https://openalex.org/W2030915759,"C-reactive protein (CRP) binds with high affinity to fibronectin (Fn), a major component of the extracellular matrix (ECM), but at physiological pH the binding is inhibited by calcium ions (Ca<sup>2+</sup>). Because CRP circulates in the blood in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound form, the occurrence of CRP-Fn interactions <i>in vivo</i> has been doubtful. To define the basis of inhibition of CRP-Fn interaction by Ca<sup>2+</sup> at pH 7.0, we hypothesized that Fn-binding site on CRP consisted of amino acids co-ordinating Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

To determine the requirements for possible interaction between Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound CRP and Fn, we investigated inhibition of CRP-Fn interaction by Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a function of pH. Ca<sup>2+</sup> did not inhibit binding of CRP to Fn at pH 6.5 and lower. The contrasting Fn binding properties of CRP at physiological and mildly acidic pH indicated that the interaction of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound CRP with Fn was controlled by pH. We conclude that the inhibition of binding of CRP to Fn by Ca<sup>2+</sup> at pH 7.0 is a mechanism to prevent CRP-Fn interactions under normal conditions. CRP, in its Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound state, is capable of binding Fn but only at the inflammatory sites and tumors with low pH. CRP, Fn, and the ECM all have been implicated in cancer. Taken together our data raise the possibility that CRP-Fn interactions may change the architecture of ECM to modify the development of tumors."

The MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway controls many different ion transports both in proximal and distal nephron, raising the question of whether this pathway is involved in the basal and/or hormone-dependent transepithelial sodium reabsorption in the principal cell of the cortical collecting duct (CCD), a process mediated by the apical epithelial sodium channel and the basolateral sodium pump (Na,K-ATPase). To answer this question we used ex vivo microdissected CCDs from normal mouse kidney or in vitro cultured mpkCCDcl4 principal cells. Significant basal levels of pERK1/2 were observed ex vivo and in vitro. Aldosterone and vasopressin, known to up-regulate sodium reabsorption in CCDs, did not change ERK1/2 activity either ex vivo or in vitro. Basal and aldosterone- or vasopressin-stimulated sodium transport was down-regulated by the MEK1/2 inhibitor PD98059, in parallel with a decrease in pERK1/2 in vitro. The activity of Na,K-ATPase but not that of epithelial sodium channel was inhibited by MEK1/2 inhibitors in both unstimulated and aldosterone- or vasopressin-stimulated CCDs in vitro. Cell surface biotinylation showed that intrinsic activity rather than cell surface expression of Na,K-ATPase was controlled by pERK1/2. PD98059 also significantly inhibited the activity of Na,K-ATPase ex vivo. Our data demonstrate that the ERK1/2 pathway controls Na,K-ATPase activity and transepithelial sodium transport in the principal cell and indicate that basal constitutive activity of the ERK1/2 pathway is a critical component of this control.

The extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) 1The abbreviations used are: ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; pERK, phosphorylated ERK1/2; MAP kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ENaC, epithelial sodium channel; CCD, cortical collecting duct; EGF, epidermal growth factor; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. pathway, also known as p42 and p44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway, plays a critical role in cellular responses to a wide variety of external stimuli including hormones, growth factors, and environmental stress (for review, see Refs. 1Cowan K.J. Storey K.B. J. Exp. Biol. 2003; 206: 1107-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar and 2Tian W. Zhang Z. Cohen D.M. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 279: F593-F604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ERK1/2 pathway is a three-step kinase cascade in which ERK1/2 kinases are phosphorylated/activated by two immediate upstream MAP kinases (MEK1 and MEK2 (MEK1/2)) that are in turn phosphorylated/activated by several MAP kinases (i.e. MOS, C-Raf, and B-Raf). Activated ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) phosphorylates various downstream effectors involved in differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, survival, cellular metabolism, and ion transport. The MAP kinase cascade may also be constitutively activated independent of external stimuli or ligands. This basal activity is the result of the balance between positive and negative factors regulating MAP kinases activity; that is, phosphatases, subcellular localization, expression of scaffold proteins, and activity of other kinases. In the kidney, the ERK1/2 pathway is involved in the hormonal regulation of different apical and basolateral channels or transporters expressed along the nephron for maintaining the extracellular fluid homeostasis. In the proximal tubule the ERK1/2 pathway is involved in the internalization of the Na+/phosphate co-transporter at the apical membrane and in the activation of Na,K-ATPase at the basolateral membrane (3Bacic D.

Chem. 2004; 279: 17418-17427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In the thick ascending limb the ERK1/2 pathway is also involved in the inhibition of basolateral Na+/H+ exchange activity and HCO–3 absorption by nerve growth factor (5Watts B.A. II I Good D.W. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: F1056-F1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the β-intercalated cells of the collecting duct, the ERK1/2 pathway plays a significant role in the isoproterenol-dependent activation of H,K-ATPase (6Laroche-Joubert N. Marsy S. Luriau S. Imbert-Teboul M. Doucet A. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 284: F948-F954Google Scholar, 7Laroche-Joubert N. Marsy S. Michelet S. Imbert-Teboul M. Doucet A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 18598-18604Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In the principal cell of the collecting duct, the rate of sodium reabsorption is continuously adapted to maintain the osmolarity and the volume of the extracellular body fluid within a physiological range. Aldosterone and vasopressin play a major role in the control of sodium and water reabsorption in the principal cell. In this cell sodium enters the cell from the tubular lumen via an apical amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) (8Kellenberger S. Schild L. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 735-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar) and is then extruded out of the cell into the extracellular fluid by the basolateral Na,K-ATPase (9Geering K. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 1997; 6: 434-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Importantly, several studies have demonstrated that ENaC or Na,K-ATPase are directly or indirectly targets for ERK1/2 activity (4Khundmiri S.J. Bertorello A.M. Delamere N.A. Lederer E.D. J. Biol.

Interestingly, immunohistochemical studies have recently revealed that the phosphorylated active form of ERK1/2 (pERK1/2) is expressed at detectable basal levels in the distal (but not in the proximal) nephron of normal rat kidney in vivo (14Andreucci M. Michael A. Kramers C. Park K.M. Chen A. Matthaeus T. Alessandrini A. Haq S. Force T. Bonventre J.V.

Kidney Int. 2003; 63: 1256-1264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) have recently shown that pERK1/2 is expressed in the principal cell and not in the intercalated cells. These in vivo data suggest that basal activity of ERK1/2 may have a specific physiological relevance in the principal cell of the collecting duct, independent of hormonal or ligand-induced stimuli and distinct from the hormone-dependent effects observed in intercalated cells. To address this question we investigated the role of ERK1/2 activity on transepithelial sodium transport in the principal cell of ex vivo microdissected cortical collecting duct (CCD) tubules or in vitro in mpkCCDcl4 cells, a well differentiated cell culture model of the principal cell (18Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F. Pascual-Letallec L. Kahn A. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Rossier B.C. Vandewalle A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The aim of this study was 2-fold; first, to assess the role of ERK1/2 activity in basal and hormone-stimulated transepithelial sodium transport in the principal cell, and second, to examine whether ENaC and/or Na,K-ATPase activity is controlled by pERK1/2. To inhibit the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway in the principal cell we used three structurally unrelated inhibitors (PD98059, U0126, and SL327) of MEK1/2, allowing correlation of the physiological response (sodium transport) with the biochemical response (degree of phosphorylation of ERK1/2). We show that the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway constitutively activates Na,K-ATPase but has no effect on ENaC and that the activation of Na,K-ATPase by the pERK1/2 pathway is required for both basal and aldosterone- or vasopressin-stimulated sodium transport. Our data also indicate that the activities of Na,K-ATPase and transepithelial sodium reabsorption in the principal cell are controlled by the constitutive or ligand-independent basal activity of ERK1/2. Isolation of Different Parts of the Nephron—Experiments were performed on male NMRI mice that had free access to water and standard laboratory chow until anesthesia. Isolated tubules were obtained by microdissection of the left kidney perfused with 40 μg/ml Liberase Blendzyme 2 (Roche Applied Science) dissolved in DMEM/F-12 (1:1) medium (21041 medium, Invitrogen). Thin pyramids cut along the corticomedullary axis were incubated at 37 °C for 40 min in aerated DMEM/F-12 (1:1) medium containing 40 μg/ml Liberase. Microdissection was performed in ice-cold DMEM/F-12 (1:1) medium as described (19Elalouf J.M. Buhler J.M. Tessiot C. Bellanger A.C. Dublineau I. de Rouffignac C. J. Clin. Investig. 1993; 91: 264-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The following structures were isolated: proximal tubule, medullary, and cortical portions of the thick ascending limb, distal convoluted tubule, connecting tubule, and cortical and outer medullary portions of the collecting duct. Tubular length was measured with an ocular micrometer (Zeiss), and pools of CCDs containing 10–20 microdissected tubules with the total tubular length of ∼10 mm/pool were transferred in 5 μl of DMEM/F-12 (1:1) medium into 1.5 ml of Eppendorf tubes. Stimulation with hormones was performed by adding 5 μl of doubly concentrated hormonal solutions in the same medium. The incubation was performed at 35 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 10 μl of doubly concentrated protein sample buffer (4.8% (w/v) SDS, 6.9% (w/v) sucrose, 0.012% (w/v) bromphenol blue, 2.1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol). Western Blotting on Microdissected Nephron Segments—Samples were heated at 95 °C for 5 min and loaded and electrophoresed on a 13% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to Protran nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell), and a Western blot was performed according to a standard procedure. Both anti-phospho-ERK1/2 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz) and anti-total-ERK1/2 monoclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) were used at 1:50 dilution. The anti-actin antibody (Sigma) was used at a 1:250 dilution. The membrane was first probed with anti-phospho-ERK1/2 antibody and, after stripping, with anti-total-ERK1/2 and anti-actin antibodies. Blots were revealed with SuperSignal reagent (Pierce). Cell Culture—The mpkCCDcl4 cells were routinely grown in plastic tissue culture flasks in a modified DMEM/F-12 (1:1) medium (31331 medium, Invitrogen) supplemented with 60 nm sodium selenate, 5 μg/ml transferrin, 2.5 nm dexamethasone, 1 nm triiodothyronine, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF), 5 μg/ml insulin, 11 mm d-glucose, 2% fetal calf serum, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin (referred to as Complete medium) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. For electrophysiological and biochemical experiments, the mpkCCDcl4 cells were seeded and grown in the same medium on collagen-coated filters (Snapwell or Transwell, 0.4-μm pore, 1 or 4.7 cm2, respectively; Corning Costar) until the cell monolayer reached transepithelial resistance greater than 000 ohm x cm2. After 5 days confluent cells were placed in identical medium but deprived of EGF, transferrin, and fetal calf serum for 5 days (referred to as Light medium). Eighteen hours before experiments filters were placed in DMEM/F-12 (1:1) medium supplemented with 11 mm d-glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin (referred to as Minimal medium). Electrophysiological Measurements of Transepithelial Short Circuit Current (Isc) in mpkCCDcl4 Cells Grown on Snapwell Filters—Transepithelial short circuit currents (Isc) were recorded on confluent mpkC-CDcl4 cells grown on Snapwell filters and mounted in Ussing chambers, as described (20Auberson M. Hoffmann-Pochon N. Vandewalle A. Kellenberger S. Schild L. Am. J. Physiol. 2003; 285: F459-F471Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, the epithelium was maintained under current-clamp conditions instead of voltage-clamp conditions to avoid high transepithelial Na+ flux, which could saturate the transport capacities of the cells. The transepithelial resistance (Rte, kiloohms) was calculated from ±10-μA pulses of 20 ms duration elicited by a computer-controlled multichannel voltage-clamp apparatus (Physiological Instruments). The equivalent Isc (μA/cm2) was calculated from the measured transepithelial voltage (Vte) and the transepithelial resistance (Isc = Vte/Rte). In a standard experiment the Isc was simultaneously measured on six independently mounted Snapwell filters. The mean basal current of 26 filters used was 24.2 ± l4.8 μA/cm2 (n = 26). ERK1/2 Western Blotting in mpkCCDcl4 Cells—Immediately after the last Isc measurement, cells were scraped into 80 μl of Snapwell SDS-PAGE protein sample buffer. Samples were then sonicated for 15 and heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and 20 μl were loaded and electrophoresed on a 13% SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred for Western blotting, as described above. A pool of active or phosphorylated ERK1/2 was detected using anti-phospho-ERK1/2 monoclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz) at a 1:1000 dilution. After stripping, the same membrane was used for detection of the total pool of ERK1/2 using anti-ERK1/2 monoclonal antibody (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) at a 1:1000 dilution. Measurements of Na,K-ATPase Current in Apically Permeabilized mpkCCDcl4 Cells—After incubation for at least 18 h in Minimal medium, confluent mpkCCDc14 cells were transferred to a Ussing chamber in the Na+-free buffer containing 116 mm K+ gluconate, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.6 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm d-glucose, 12 mm essential amino acids (free acids), 2 mm nonessential amino acids (free acids), 0.4 mm glutamine, 25 mm HEPES, 3 mm BaCl2, pH 7.4 (Buffer A). After a 7-min stabilization period, cells were apically permeabilized with 17.5 μg/ml amphotericin B for 5 min, as described (21Summa V. Mordasini D. Roger F. Bens M. Martin P.Y. Vandewalle A. Verrey F. Feraille E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47087-47093Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The Na,K-ATPase was activated by apical and basolateral addition of Na+-containing buffer (60 mm Na+ gluconate, 56 mm K+ gluconate, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.6 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm d-glucose, 12 mm essential amino acids, 2mm nonessential amino acids, 0.4 mm glutamine, 25 mm HEPES, 3 mm BaCl2, pH 7.4) (Buffer B). This raised the apical and basolateral Na+ concentrations to 30 mm. After a 3-min stabilization of the Na,K-ATPase current, MEK1/2 inhibitors were added to both apical and basolateral sides. The effect of the inhibitors was monitored for 5 min. At the end of this period 2 mm ouabain was added to the basolateral solution to completely block the pump current. Measurements of ENaC Current in Basolaterally Permeabilized mpkCCDcl4 Cells—After incubation for at least 18 h in Minimal medium, confluent mpkCCDc14 cells were transferred to a Ussing chamber in the 100 mm Na+ apical buffer containing 100 mm Na+ gluconate, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.6 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm d-glucose, 12 mm essential amino acids, 2 mm nonessential amino acids, 0.4 mm glutamine, 25 mm HEPES, 10 μm amiloride, pH 7.4 (Buffer C), and in the 100 mm K+ basolateral buffer containing 100 mm K+ gluconate, 1.8 mm CaCl2, 1.6 mm MgCl2, 0.8 mm KH2PO4, 2 mm d-glucose, 12 mm essential amino acids, 2 mm nonessential amino acids, 0.4 mm glutamine, 25 mm HEPES, 2 mm ouabain, pH 7.4 (Buffer D). After stabilization of cell monolayer resistance, cells were basolaterally permeabilized with 17.5 μg/ml amphotericin B. Then the apical amiloride was washed out by replacement of the apical buffer by 50 ml of buffer C, free of amiloride (Buffer E). After stabilization of Isc (∼2–3 min) MEK1/2 inhibitors were added to both apical and basolateral sides. At the end of the experiment the ENaC activity was blocked by 10 μm amiloride. Cell Surface Biotinylation of Na,K-ATPase—Cell surface biotinylation was performed according to the protocol described by Planes et al., with minor modifications (22Planes C. Blot-Chabaud M. Matthay M.A. Couette S. Uchida T. Clerici C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 47318-47324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). mpkCCDc14 cells grown on Transwell filters (2 filters/condition) were placed on ice and washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline solution complemented with 0.1 mm CaCl2 and 1 mm MgCl2 (Buffer F). Basolateral membrane proteins were biotinylated by a 1-h incubation at 4 °C with 1.25 mg/ml NHS-ssbiotin (Pierce) freshly diluted in the biotinylation buffer (10 mm triethanolamine, 2 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5) (Buffer G) and stirred gently. Cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline complemented with 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, and 100 mm glycine, pH 7.5 (Buffer H), for 20 min at 4 °C to quench unreacted biotin. The cells were then rinsed twice with Buffer F, scraped in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted at 2000 rpm at 4 °C. The pellets were solubilized for 45 min in 20 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5 (Buffer I), containing protease inhibitors. The lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were incubated overnight with streptavidin-agarose beads to recover biotinylated proteins. The beads were then pelleted by centrifugation, and aliquots of supernatants were taken to determine the unbound, intracellular pool of proteins. Biotinylated proteins were eluted from the beads by heating at 56 °C for 7 min in SDS-PAGE sample buffer before loading onto a 10% SDS gel. The a1 subunit of Na,K-ATPase was detected by Western blotting using the antibody described in Girardet et al. (23Girardet M. Geering K. Frantes J.M. Geser D. Rossier B.C. Kraehenbühl J.-P. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 6684-6691Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). As a control for cell surface versus intracellular protein biotinylation, the same blots were probed with an anti-actin antibody (Sigma). Measurement of Na,K-ATPase Activity in Microdissected CCDs—The hydrolytic activity of Na,K-ATPase was determined on pools of 4–6 permeabilized CCDs by a radiochemical microassay, as previously described (24Deschenes G. Doucet A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2000; 11: 604-615Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tubules were permeabilized by the classical procedure with a freezing-thawing step. Total ATPase activity was measured after the addition of a solution that contained 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm Tris-HCl, 10 mm Na2ATP, and 5 nCi/μl [γ-32P]ATP (DuPont) (2–10 Ci/mmol) at pH 7.4 (Buffer J). For Na+,K+-independent ATPase activity measurements, NaCl and KCl were omitted, Tris-HCl was 150 mm, and 2 mm ouabain was added. Na,K-ATPase activity (in pmol of ATP/ml of tubule/h) was taken as the difference between total and Na+,K+-independent ATPase activities. MEK1/2 Inhibitors—PD98059, U0126, and SL327 were prepared as 10 mm stock solution in Me2SO. An equivalent volume of Me2SO (0.5% for 50 μm inhibitors concentration) was used for the control treatments. Ex Vivo Expression of pERK1/2 along the Nephron—Mice used in these experiments had free access to water and standard laboratory chow and were not subjected to any special treatment. To assess the pattern of ERK1/2 and pERK1/2 expression along the nephron and to compare it to the previously published immunostaining pattern observed in vivo (14Andreucci M. Michael A. Kramers C.

Kidney Int. 2000; 58: 27-37Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), we microdissected different segments of the mouse nephron. Protein extracts from 10 glomeruli or 10 mm of microdissected tubules (∼3000–5000 cells) were used for Western blotting with anti-pERK1/2, anti-ERK1/2, and anti-actin antibodies. As shown in Fig. 1, pERK1/2 is expressed at detectable levels in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT), connecting tubule (CNT), and CCD but not in the other more proximal nephron segments. On the same blot, the anti-ERK1/2 antibody detected a strong expression of total (active and inactive) pool of ERK1/2 in the proximal tubule but was not sensitive enough to detect ERK1/2 expression in other nephron segments. In microdissected CCDs, the presence of the active form of ERK1/2 in basal conditions was demonstrated in 15 independent experiments and was consistently detected independently of many possible variables including circadian rhythm (the time of mouse perfusion and of microdissection varied from early morning to late afternoon). To examine whether the basal activity pERK1/2 observed in CCDs could be further stimulated by hormones known to increase transepithelial sodium transport, we stimulated microdissected CCDs with aldosterone (165 min, 10–6m) or vasopressin (90 min, 10–8m). As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, respectively, there was no significant change of pERK1/2 expression (as corrected for actin) induced by aldosterone or vasopressin (110.1 ± 17.6% (n = 5, not significant) or 103.2 ± 7.6% (n = 6, not significant) respectively, compared with unstimulated cells). These observations are consistent with the in vivo immunostaining data. Expression of pERK1/2 in mpkCCDcl4 Cells—To study the role of the pERK1/2 pathway in regulating sodium reabsorption in the principal cell, we used the mpkCCDcl4 cell line derived from the principal cell of the mouse collecting duct (18Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F. Pascual-Letallec L. Kahn A. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Rossier B.C. Vandewalle A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This cell line exhibits a high transmural resistance (<3000 Ohm·cm2) and a high transepithelial Na+ transport, which is up-regulated by aldosterone and vasopressin (18Bens M. Vallet V. Cluzeaud F. Pascual-Letallec L. Kahn A. Rafestin-Oblin M.E. Rossier B.C. Vandewalle A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 923-934Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This phenotype is achieved by changing the culture condition in the function of growth or differentiation. For growth, the mpkCCD requires insulin, dexamethasone, T3, EGF, and fetal calf serum. For differentiation, the cells are then seeded on Transwell filters to establish polarized monolayers, allowing measurement of transepithelial sodium transport. The medium contained insulin, dexamethasone, T3, but no serum for 5 days. Finally, for the electrophysiological measurement, all factors can be removed. The monolayer can keep its sodium transport properties for days cultured in straight DMEM/F-12 medium without any serum or factors added. It is, therefore, an ideal system to study whether basal ERK 1/2 activity could be maintained in the absence of any potential external stimulus. It permits establishing direct relationships between the sodium transport (measured by the short circuit current method) and the biochemical response (by assessing the level of ERK1/2 and its active form). We first addressed the question of whether pERK1/2 is expressed in mpkCCDcl4 cells in basal conditions and whether pERK1/2 expression is regulated by aldosterone or vasopressin. In standard experimental conditions we used polarized mpkCCDcl4 cells grown on porous filters incubated in serum- and hormone-free “Minimal medium” for at least 18 h before the experiments (see “Materials and Methods”). As shown in Fig. 3, A and B, the mpkCCDcl4 cells in standard conditions express a detectable basal level of pERK1/2. Up to 3 h of stimulation with aldosterone (10–6m) and up to 4 h of stimulation with vasopressin (10–8m) did not significantly change the levels of pERK1/2 expression (Fig. 3, A and B, respectively) as observed ex vivo. To examine whether pERK1/2 expression in mpkCCDcl4 cells could be regulated by other “classical” external stimuli, we incubated cells in three different culture media that contain (Complete medium, see “Materials and Methods”) or do not contain (Light and Minimal media, see “Materials and Methods”) serum and EGF, two known stimulators of ERK1/2 activity. As shown in Fig. 3C, pERK1/2 levels were similar between cells incubated in Light or Minimal media. However, pERK1/2 level was significantly stimulated in cells incubated in the Complete medium (pERK1/2 expression in the Light medium was 148 ± 38% of the pERK1/2 expression in the Minimal medium (n = 4, NS); pERK1/2 expression in the Complete medium was 261 ± 25% of the pERK1/2 expression in the Minimal medium (n = 4, p < 0.05)). These results demonstrate that the absence of regulation of pERK1/2 expression by aldosterone and vasopressin in mpkCCDcl4 cells is not due to a maximal stimulation of ERK1/2 activity. PD98059 Reversibly Inhibits Transepithelial Sodium Transport and ERK1/2 Phosphorylation in mpkCCDcl4 Cell—To further examine the role of the ERK1/2 pathway in transepithelial sodium transport in the principal cell, we assessed the effect of PD98059 (a MEK1/2 inhibitor) on transepithelial short circuit current (Isc). PD98059 is known to inhibit the activation of MEK1 and MEK2 with IC50 values of 2–7 and 50 μm, respectively (25Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3256) Google Scholar). Isc was measured on confluent mpkCCDcl4 cells grown on Snapwell filters and incubated in the Minimal medium for at least 18 h before experiments. The addition of PD98059 (50 μm) to both basolateral and apical sides of unstimulated mpkCCDcl4 cells resulted in a rapid (within minutes) inhibition of basal Isc, a decrease in transepithelial potential difference, and an increase in transepithelial resistance (Fig. 4A and Table I). This inhibition of Isc was slowly (within 30 min) but completely reversible without washout of the inhibitor. PD98059 did not produce any effect on Isc when ENaC activity was blocked by 10 μm amiloride (Fig. 4B). The addition of PD98059 to apical or basolateral sides of mpkCCDcl4 cells produced the same inhibitory effect on Isc as when the inhibitor was added from both sides (data not shown).Table IEffect of PD98059 (50 μm) on transepithelial resistance (R), transepithelial voltage (V), and transepithelial short circuit current (Isc) in mpkCCDcl4 cellsBefore PD98059With PD98059Changep%Unstimula"

Both PAF receptor-dependent and -independent pathways are implicated. In this study, we show that extracellular PAF can be internalized through PAF receptor-independent mechanisms and can initiate caspase-3-dependent apoptosis when cytosolic concentrations are elevated by ∼15 pm/cell for 60 min. Reducing cytosolic PAF to less than 10 pm/cell terminates apoptotic signaling. By pharmacological inhibition of PAF acetylhydrolase I and II (PAF-AH) activity and down-regulation of PAF-AH I catalytic subunits by RNA interference, we show that the PAF receptor-independent death pathway is regulated by PAF-AH I and, to a lesser extent, by PAF-AH II. Moreover, the anti-apoptotic actions of PAF-AH I are subunit-specific. PAF-AH I α1 regulates intracellular PAF concentrations under normal physiological conditions, but expression is not sufficient to reduce an acute rise in intracellular PAF levels. PAF-AH I α2 expression is induced when cells are deprived of serum or exposed to apoptogenic PAF concentrations limiting the duration of pathological cytosolic PAF accumulation. To block PAF receptor-independent death pathway, we screened a panel of PAF antagonists (CV-3988, CV-6209, BN 52021, and FR 49175).

Whether or not these effects are dependent on PAFR activation is not clear. One approach to intervening in both PAFR-dependent and -independent cell death lies in reducing pathological increases in PAF. PAF is hydrolyzed by a unique family of serine esterases or PAF acetylhydrolases (PAF-AHs) that cleave the biologically sn-2 active side chain generating lyso-PAF. Three PAF-AH enzymes have been identified. Cytosolic PAF-AH I cleaves the acetyl group at the sn-2 position of PAF and PAF-like lipids with other phosphate head groups (21Manya H. Aoki J. Kato H.

The enzymatic complex is a G-protein-like trimer composed of two 29-kDa α1 and α2 catalytic subunits. The α subunits form homodimers or heterodimers that complex with a noncatalytic 45-kDa regulatory β subunit, LIS1. Mutations in the LIS1 gene are the genetic determinant of Miller-Dieker syndrome, a developmental brain disorder defined by type 1 lissencephaly (22Hattori M. Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K.

In vivo, intravenous injection of human plasma PAF-AH reduces lethality in experimental models of anaphylactic shock (8Fukuda Y. Kawashima H. Saito K. Inomata N. Matsui M. Nakanishi T. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2000; 390: 203-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These findings provide compelling evidence that PAF-AH activity regulates PAF-mediated apoptosis. It remains to be determined whether these enzymes can, in fact, be targeted to inhibit PAF-mediated degeneration and disease. In this study, we used the PC12 cell model to investigate the anti-apoptotic actions of PAF-AH I and PAF-AH II in the PAFR-independent death pathway. We show that PC12 cells express all three PAF-AH I proteins (α1, α2, and LIS1) as well as PAF-AH II but not plasma PAF-AH or PAFR. Expression of PAF-AH I α2 but not PAF-AH I α1 is induced when PC12 cells are deprived of serum. We found that this induction regulates the duration of apoptotic signaling initiated by PAF challenge. To enhance the endogenous anti-apoptotic activity of PAF-AH I α2, we screened a panel of PAF antagonists, and we identified two compounds that blocked PAFR-independent death. Both compounds, the fungal derivative FR 49175 and the ginkgolide BN 52021, protected cells by accelerating PAF hydrolysis. Most surprisingly, both inhibitors suppressed α1 protein expression thereby promoting α2/α2 homodimer activity following PAF treatment. These findings point to a novel anti-apoptotic function for the α2 subunit of PAF-AH I and a potential means of pharmacologically targeting PAF-AH enzymes to reduce PAF-mediated cell death. Cell Culture—PC12-AC cells, a clonal derivative of the PC12 pheochromocytoma cell line (American Tissue Culture Collection), were cultured in complete media composed of RPMI 1640 containing 10% horse serum and 5% newborn calf serum at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air atmosphere. Culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. Reverse Transcriptase (RT)-PCR—Rat brain RNA was prepared from Wistar rats ∼3 months of age (Charles River Breeding Laboratories). Rodents were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and euthanized by decapitation. All manipulations were performed in compliance with approved institutional protocols and according to the strict ethical guidelines for animal experimentation established by the Canadian Council for Animal Care. Total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with RQ1-DNase I (Promega) to eliminate residual genomic DNA. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using random hexamer primers (Promega) and Superscript II RT (Invitrogen). Control reactions for residual genomic contamination were carried out in the absence of Superscript II RT. cDNA synthesis was performed using 5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) in the presence of 1 mm MgCl2 and 10 pmol per primer for glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 20 pmol per primer for PAF-AH II2, PAF-AH II3, and PAF-AH II4, and 25 pmol per primer for PAF-AH I α1, PAF-AH I α2, PAF-AH I LIS1, PAF-AH II1, plasma PAF-AH, and PAFR.

Rodents were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and euthanized by decapitation. Brains were removed and placed in a 10-cm tissue culture plate containing artificial cerebrospinal fluid (26 mm NaHCO3, 124 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1.3 mm MgCl2, 10 mm d-glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, pH 7.3) and homogenized using a Tissue Tearor (Fisher). Protein was isolated using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen). Proteins from PC12 cells were isolated in RIPA buffer (10 mm PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 30 μl/ml aprotinin, 10 mm sodium orthovanadate, 100 μl/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Protein samples (30 μg) were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. Antibodies were diluted in 1% heat-denaturated casein in 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 10 mm sodium phosphate, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm NaCl, pH 7.5). Western analyses were performed using polyclonal anti-LIS1 (1:500, Chemicon), monoclonal anti-α1 (1:1000, Dr. H. Arai, University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan), monoclonal anti-α2 (1:1000, Dr. H. Arai), poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP, 1:10, 000, Clontech), and actin (1:1000, Sigma). Secondary antibodies were horseradish peroxidase-conjugated or biotin-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:2000, Jackson ImmunoResearch; 1:10, 000, Sigma) or anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (1: 5000, Jackson ImmunoResearch), and tertiary reagents were extravidin alkaline phosphatase (1:300,000, Sigma) as appropriate. Immunoreactive bands were visualized using SuperSignal West Pico (MJS BioLynx Inc.) or nitro blue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (Sigma). Densitometry was performed using ImageJ analysis software (National Institutes of Health) standardized to actin loading controls. PAF-AH Activity—PAF-AH activities in complete media, serum-free RPMI, PC12-AC cells, PC12-AC conditioned treatment media, and C57Bl/6 mouse brain ∼3 months of age (positive control) were determined using a commercial PAF-AH assay kit (Cayman Chemicals). Cells and tissue were homogenized in 250 mm sucrose, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 1 mm EDTA using a Tissue Tearor (Fisher). Samples were centrifuged at 600 × g for 10 min and at 100,000 × g for 60 min. Cytosolic supernatants were concentrated using an Amicon centrifuge concentrator with a molecular mass cut-off of 10,000 kDa (Millipore). Protein (30–50 μg) was incubated with C16-2-thio-PAF substrate for 30 min at room temperature. In some cases, lysates were pretreated for 15 or 30 min at room temperature with diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP) at the concentrations indicated in the text. Percent inhibition was calculated relative to lysates treated with vehicle (PBS) for the same time. Hydrolysis of the thioester bond at the sn-2 position was detected by conjugation with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) at 405 nm. Control reactions included samples incubated without lysate or media and samples incubated without substrate. Internalization Assay (Live Cell Imaging)—PC12-AC cells (5 × 104 cells/well) were plated in complete media overnight in 24-well plates (VWR Scientific) coated with 0.1% gelatin. Cells were washed in 10 mm PBS and incubated with 1 μm Bodipy FL C11-PAF (B-PAF) in RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma). B-PAF was custom-synthesized for our laboratory by Molecular Probes. At each time point (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 90, 100, 110, and 120 min), incubation media were removed, and cells were washed with 10 mm PBS. Live cell imaging under phase and fluorescence of identical cell fields was performed using a DMR inverted microscope (Leica) equipped with a QICAM digital camera (Quorum Technologies) and captured using OpenLab software version 3.17 (Improvision). Following time-lapse imaging, the incubation media were replaced, and internalization was allowed to continue. Quantitation of fluorescence intensity of individual cells was performed using the Advanced Measurement Module of OpenLab version 3.17. Lipid Extraction and TLC—PC12-AC cells seeded at 1 × 105 cells onto 10-cm plates were maintained in complete media at 37 °C in 5% CO2 for 72 h. Cultures were incubated at 37 °C with 1 μm B-PAF in RPMI 1640 containing 0.1% BSA for 0, 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 75 min. At each time point, 4 plates/condition were removed from the incubator and were placed on ice. One ml of methanol acidified with 2% acetic acid was added to each plate, and the extracellular fraction was collected. This fraction contained B-PAF in the culture media and uninternalized B-PAF bound to cell surface proteins or associated with the plasma membrane. The remaining monolayer of cells was collected in acidified methanol by scraping the plate with a cell lifter (Fisher). Lipids were extracted from the extracellular milieu and cytosolic fractions by the Bligh and Dyer method (32Bligh E.C. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar) and developed on TLC plates (20 × 20 cm Silica Gel 60 (Fisher) in a solvent system of chloroform/methanol/acetic acid/water (50:30:8:5, v/v). B-PAF and B-lyso-PAF (Molecular Probes) were used as authentic markers. Fluorescent lipids were visualized under UV light using AlphaImager-1220 software (Alpha Innotech Corp.). Fluorescence intensity corresponding to lipid yield was determined by densitometry using the Advanced Measurement Module of OpenLab version 3.17. Concentrations of cytosolic B-PAF were estimated in comparison to a B-PAF standard curve resolved in parallel. Data are expressed as pm/PAF-responsive cell following standardization to the number of cells/culture. Cell Death Assays—PC12-AC cells (8800 cells/cm2) were plated overnight in complete media in 6-cm diameter tissue culture plates (VWR Scientific). Cells were treated in serum-free RPMI media containing 0.025% BSA (treatment media) for 24–72 h with EtOH (0.1%), PAF (10 nm-1 μm, Biomol Research Laboratories), methyl-carbamyl-PAF (mc-PAF; 100 nm-1 μm, Biomol Research Laboratories), or lyso-PAF (10 nm-1 μm, Biomol Research Laboratories). In some cases, cells were pretreated with BN 52021 (1–100 μm, Biomol Research Laboratories), CV-3988 (0.2–2 μm, Biomol Research Laboratories), CV-6209 (1–10 μm, Biomol Research Laboratories), FR 49175 (0.5–50 μm, Biomol Research Laboratories), DFP (0.1 mm or 1 mm, Sigma), DTNB (1 mm, Sigma), or combinations thereof for 15 min followed by addition of PAF (1 μm) for 24 h. Cell survival was assessed by hemocytometer cell counts of trypan blue-excluding cells. Metabolic activity was assessed based on the ability of mitochondrial dehydrogenases, active in viable cells, to reduce the formazan salt, WST-1 (measured at A450–A690 nm, Roche Applied Science). DNA fragmentation was determined by terminal deoxytransferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL, Roche Applied Science) of cultures fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in 10 mm as described previously (33Bennett S.A.L. Chen J. Pappas B.A. Roberts D.C.S. Tenniswood M. Cell Death Differ. 1998; 5: 867-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Cells, processed for TUNEL, were double-labeled with Hoechst 33258 (0.2 μg/ml) for 20 min at room temperature for additional morphological evidence of apoptotic loss. RNA Interference Transfection—To suppress expression of the PAF-AH I α2 subunit, we designed a double-stranded short interfering RNA (siRNA) to the α2 sequence (AATAAACATGCTTGTCACTCCC/CTGTCTC) and a negative control scrambled sequence (AATGCATAGGAGTTGGAGAGGC/CTGTCTC). Oligonucleotides were obtained from the Biotechnology Research Institute at the University of Ottawa. siRNA duplexes were generated using the Silencer siRNA construction kit (Ambion). Transfection of siRNA was performed with LipofectAMINE 2000 (Invitrogen) and optimized to yield maximal transfection efficiency according to manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 2 μl of LipofectAMINE 2000 was diluted in 198 μl of RPMI 1640 media for 5 min at room temperature. siRNA duplexes (PAF-AH α2 or scrambled) were suspended in 100 μl of RPMI 1640 media. PC12-AC cells grown in complete media to 30% confluence in 4-well gelatin-coated Labtek wells were treated with 100 μl of the LipofectAMINE-siRNA complex and incubated for 72 h at 37 °C. Transfection efficiency was determined in separate cultures by counting EGFP-positive cells upon transfection with pEGFP-C1 as well as morphological changes using β-actin siRNA positive control (Ambion). Because we were unable to obtain >20% transfection efficiency, we co-transfected PAF-AH α2 or scrambled siRNAs with 0.028 μg/μl of pEGFP-C1 to identify silenced cells. Cells were then exposed to 1 μm PAF in treatment media (RPMI + 0.025% BSA) for either 45 min or 24 h. Data were standardized to the number of EGFP-positive cells in vehicle-treated cultures transfected with pEGFP-C1 only. Statistical Analysis—Data were analyzed by using ANOVA tests or unpaired Student's t tests, as applicable. Following detection of a statistically significant difference in a given series of treatments, post hoc Dunnett's t-tests or Tukey tests were performed where appropriate. p values under 0.05 were considered statistically significant (shown as * or †); p values under 0.01 were considered highly statistically significant (shown as ** or ††). PAF Can Elicit Apoptosis Independently of Its G-protein-coupled Receptor—We have demonstrated previously (11Brewer C. Bonin F. Bullock B. Nault M.-C. Morin J. Imbeault S. Shen T.Y. Franks D.J. Bennett S.A.L. J. Neurochem. 2002; 18: 1502-1511Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar) that PC12-AC cells do not express PAFR but undergo apoptosis-associated DNA fragmentation 24 h after treatment with ≥100 nm PAF and necrotic lysis when treated with >3 μm PAF. In this study, we addressed the kinetics and underlying signaling mechanism of PAF-induced apoptosis in the absence of PAFR (Fig. 1A, inset). To determine whether cell death is mediated by PAF or downstream PAF metabolites, PC12-AC cells were treated with PAF, mc-PAF, the PAF-AH-resistant synthetic PAF analog (34O'Flaherty J. Redman J. Schmitt J. Ellis J. Surles J. Marx M. Piantadosi C. Wykle R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 147: 18-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), or lyso-PAF, the immediate PAF metabolite. Both mc-PAF and PAF triggered comparable concentration-dependent cell death 24 h after treatment (Fig. 1A). lyso-PAF had no significant effect on cell viability (Fig. 1A). To establish the kinetics of PAF-mediated cytotoxicity, cell survival was assessed at various times after phospholipid administration. PAF (1 μm) elicited significant cell loss within 24 h of treatment; no further reductions in cell number were detected at 48 or 72 h relative to vehicle controls (Fig. 1B). mc-PAF (1 μm) elicited incremental cell loss for up to 72 after treatment (Fig. 1B). Comparable kinetics were observed if PAF (1 μm) was replenished in fresh media at 24-h intervals with cells repeatedly treated with PAF exhibiting sustained impairment of cellular metabolic activity (Fig. 1C) and an incremental reduction in cell survival (Fig. 1D). To determine whether PAF activates caspases in the absence of PAFR, we examined cleavage of the caspase 3 substrate PARP. Caspase 3-mediated PARP cleavage from 116 to 85 kDa was observed 45 min after a single PAF treatment (Fig. 2A). Cleavage markedly increased 3 h after phospholipid administration and was detected for up to 24 h after treatment (Fig. 2A) but not at later time points (data not shown). TUNEL-positive cells, evidence of terminal DNA fragmentation, were first observed 24 h after PAF exposure with no evidence of additional death 48 h after exposure (Fig. 2B). Collectively, these findings indicate the following. (a) PAF can activate caspase 3 independently of its G-protein-coupled receptor within 45 min of treatment. (b) This PAFR-independent apoptotic pathway culminates in terminal DNA fragmentation 24 h after treatment. (c) Cell death is not mediated by downstream metabolites. (d) Incremental cell death depends upon repeated exposure to active ligand or treatment with PAF-AH-resistant PAF analogs. Cytosolic PAF-AH Enzymes Limit the Duration of PAF-induced Apoptotic Signaling—These kinetics implicate PAF degradation in the control of apoptotic signaling. To test this hypothesis, we first identified LIS1, PAF-AH I α1, PAH-AH I α2, and PAF-AH II but not plasma PAF-AH transcripts in PC12 cells by RT-PCR (Fig. 3, A–F). Amplicon integrity of the PAF-AH I subunits was verified by sequencing on both strands. We then confirmed protein expression by W"

When coaggregated with ITAM-bearing receptors, FcγRIIB become tyrosyl-phosphorylated and recruit the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing inositol 5′-phosphatases SHIP1 and SHIP2, which mediate inhibition. The FcγRIIB ITIM was proposed to be necessary and sufficient for recruiting SHIP1/2. We show here that a second tyrosine-containing motif in the intracytoplasmic domain of FcγRIIB is required for SHIP1/2 to be coprecipitated with the receptor. This motif functions as a docking site for the SH2 domain-containing adapters Grb2 and Grap. These adapters interact via their C-terminal SH3 domain with SHIP1/2 to form a stable receptor-phosphatase-adapter trimolecular complex. Both Grb2 and Grap are required for an optimal coprecipitation of SHIP with FcγRIIB, but one adapter is sufficient for the phosphatase to coprecipitate in a detectable manner with the receptors. In addition to facilitating the recruitment of SHIPs, the second tyrosine-based motif may confer upon FcγRIIB the properties of scaffold proteins capable of altering the composition and stability of the signaling complexes generated following receptor engagement.

FcγRIIB are low affinity receptors for the Fc portion of IgG antibodies that are widely expressed by cells of hematopoietic origin (1Daëron M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 203-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1031) Google Scholar). Their low affinity enables them to remain free in the presence of high concentrations of circulating IgGs and to bind immune complexes with a high avidity. FcγRIIB are unique among Fc receptors in exhibiting inhibitory properties. Indeed, FcγRIIB were demonstrated to negatively regulate cell activation triggered by other Fc receptors in mast cells (2Daëron M. Malbec O. Latour S. Arock M. Fridman W.H. J. Clin.

FcγRIIB must be coaggregated with activating receptors via IgG immune complexes in order to exert their inhibitory effects (2Daëron M. Malbec O. Latour S. Arock M. Fridman W.H. J. Clin.

FcγRIIB–/– mice were shown to mount enhanced antibody responses (6Wernersson S. Karlsson M.C. Dahlstrom J. Mattsson R. Verbeek J.S. Heyman B. J.

FcγRIIB are therefore likely to play major roles in the prevention of autoimmune diseases, allergies, and other inflammatory diseases.The regulatory properties of FcγRIIB were shown to depend on the presence of an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) in its intracytoplasmic domain. This motif was defined as a tyrosine residue that is followed at position Tyr + 3 and preceded at position Tyr – 2 by hydrophobic amino acids (11Vivier E. Daëron M. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 286-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The ITIM tyrosine becomes phosphorylated by a Src family protein tyrosine kinase upon the coaggregation of inhibitory receptors with activating receptors (12Malbec O. Fong D. Turner M. Tybulewicz V.L.J. Cambier J.C. Fridman W.H. Daëron M. J.

Immunity. 1998; 8: 509-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar), generated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase during cell activation, is a major substrate. Phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate enables the membrane translocation of cytosolic molecules possessing pleckstrin homology domains including Bruton's tyrosine kinase, phospholipase Cγ, and the GTP/GDP exchange factor Vav, which are essential for signaling (21Bolland S. Pearse R.N. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Immunity. 1998; 8: 509-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). SHIP1 also functions as an adapter to recruit Dok-1, which itself recruits RasGAP, which inhibits Ras activation (22Tamir I. Stolpa J.C. Helgason C.D. Nakamura K. Bruhns P. Daëron M. Cambier J.C. Immunity. 2000; 12: 347-358Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggest that the primary function of FcγRIIB is to recruit SHIP1 (and SHIP2), which dampen positive signaling. Indeed, FcγRIIB-dependent inhibition of cell activation was abrogated in mast cells (23Malbec O. Schmitt C. Bruhns P. Krystal G. Fridman W.H. Daëron M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30381-30391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and markedly inhibited in B cells (24Brauweiler A. Tamir I. Dal Porto J. Benschop R.J. Helgason C.D. Humphries R.K. Freed J.H. Cambier J.C. J. Exp. Med. 2000; 191: 1545-1554Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) from SHIP1–/– mice, and inhibition of cell activation could be induced by FcγRIIB, the intracytoplasmic domain of which was replaced by the catalytic domain of SHIP1 (25Ono M.

Ravichandran K.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3576-3589Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Likewise SHIP2, which is inducibly expressed in lipopolysaccharide-activated B cells, may contribute to FcγRIIB-dependent negative regulation of the BCR-induced activation of these cells (27Brauweiler A. Tamir I. Marschner S. Helgason C.D. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 204-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).There is a general consensus that the FcγRIIB ITIM is both necessary and sufficient for inhibition. The conclusion that it is necessary was based on the pioneer work by Amigorena et al. who showed that a 13-amino acid deletion, which was later understood to encompass the ITIM, abrogated inhibition in B cells (4Amigorena S. Bonnerot C. Drake J. Choquet D. Hunziker W. Guillet J.G. Webster P. Sautès C. Mellman I. Fridman W.H. Science. 1992; 256: 1808-1812Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). A point mutation of the ITIM tyrosine also abrogated FcγRIIB-dependent inhibition of mast cell and T cell activation (5Daëron M. Latour S. Malbec O. Espinosa E. Pina P. Pasmans S. Fridman W.H. Immunity. 1995; 3: 635-646Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar) and abolished (28Muta T. Kurosaki T. Misulovin Z. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig M.C. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1994; 368: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar) or reduced (29Fong D.C. Brauweiler A. Minskoff S.A. Bruhns P. Tamir I. Mellman I. Daëron M. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4453-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) the calcium response in B cells. The conclusion that the ITIM is sufficient was based on works by Muta et al., who showed that a chimeric molecule whose intracytoplasmic domain contained the murine FcγRIIB ITIM retained inhibitory properties in B cells (28Muta T. Kurosaki T. Misulovin Z. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig M.C. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1994; 368: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar). More recently however, we found that a C-terminal deletion of the intracytoplasmic domain of FcγRIIB, which left the ITIM intact, prevented SHIP1 from being coprecipitated in a detectable manner and reduced the inhibitory effect of FcγRIIB on BCR signaling (29Fong D.C. Brauweiler A. Minskoff S.A. Bruhns P. Tamir I. Mellman I. Daëron M. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4453-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We show here that this C-terminal sequence contains a second tyrosine-based motif that mediates the recruitment, via their SH2 domain, of the adapter proteins Grb2 and Grap, which interact, via their C-terminal SH3 domain, with SHIP1 and SHIP2, thus stabilizing the binding of these phosphatases to the FcγRIIB ITIM. Supporting a critical role of this trimolecular complex in vivo, we provide evidence that adapters are necessary for FcγRIIB to recruit phosphatases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCells—IIA1.6 cells were cultured in RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, 0.5 μm 2-mercaptoethanol, and 2 mm sodium pyruvate.

This cDNA encoding the entire extracellular and transmembrane domains and the first six intracytoplasmic amino acids of FcγRIIB was inserted into an expression vector under the control of the SRα promoter in pBR322 (32Takebe Y.

Cells were washed three times in RPMI medium, resuspended at 1 × 106 cells/ml in complete medium, and intracellular free calcium concentration was monitored with a flow cytometer. After 3 min at 37 °C, IIA1.6 cells were stimulated with 45 μg/ml RabAM IgG or 30 μg/ml RabAM F(ab′), and [Ca2+2]i was measured. The mean [Ca2+]i was evaluated with FCS Assistant 1.2.9 β software (BD Biosciences).Western Blot Analysis—Material was boiled in sample buffer, fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA). Membranes were saturated with either 5% bovine serum albumin or 5% skimmed milk (Régilait, Saint-Martin-Belle-Roche, France), diluted in Western buffer (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, and 0.5% Tween 20 (Merck), pH 7.4), and incubated with the indicated antibodies followed by horseradish peroxidase-goat anti-rabbit or horseradish peroxidase-goat anti-mouse. Labeled antibodies were detected using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences).Whole Cell Lysate Analysis—IIA1.6 transfectants were stimulated at 37 °C for the indicated times (Fig. 2) with 30 μg/ml intact RatAM IgG or 20 μg/ml F(ab′)2 fragments of RatAM IgG and lysed by three cycles of incubation for 1 min in liquid nitrogen followed by 1 min at 37 °C in pH 8 lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Proteins were quantitated using a Bio-Rad protein assay, and 40 μg of proteins were treated as described in Western blot analysis.Immunoprecipitation—IIA1.6 transfectants were stimulated at 37 °C for 3 min with 30 μg/ml intact RatAM, 20 μg/ml F(ab′)2 fragments of RatAM, or RabAM or treated with 100 mm pervanadate. Pervanadate was generated by mixing 1 ml of 20 mm Na3VO4 with 330 ml of 30% H2O2 followed by a 5-min incubation at room temperature, yielding a solution of 6 mm pervanadate. DT40 transfectants were stimulated at 37 °C for 0.5, 1, or 3 min with 30 μg/ml RabAC IgG. Cells were lysed in pH 7.4 lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 5 mm NaF, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.4 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Postnuclear lysates were immunoprecipitated with 2.4G2-coated Sepharose beads or protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) coupled to rabbit anti-Grb2 or anti-Grap antibodies. Eluates from immunoadsorbents were treated as described above under the subheading “Western Blot Analysis.”GST Fusion Proteins—cDNA encoding the SH2 domain of SHIP1 was amplified by PCR using as a template cDNA generated from RNA extracted from RBL-2H3 cells. cDNA encoding a Grap-containing GST fusion protein was a gift from Dr. S.E. Shoelson (Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA). GST-SHIP1 SH2 and GST-Grap cDNAs were inserted in pGEX-4T-2 (Amersham Biosciences) and transfected into DH5-α Escherichia coli. Bacteria producing GST-Grb2 SH2 were a gift from Dr. I. Broutin (UMR 8015 CNRS, Paris, France). Bacteria producing GST-Grb2 were a gift from Dr. S. Latour (INSERM U429, Paris, France). All fusion proteins were produced in DH5-α E. coli following isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction, purified on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Soluble fusion proteins were eluted from glutathione-agarose beads with a solution of 50 mm Tris and 25 mm glutathione, pH 8. The fusion proteins used in Fig. 3C were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. GST fusion protein beads were incubated for 2 h in lysates from 1 × 107 cells. Eluates from beads were treated as described above under the subheading “Western Blot Analysis.”Fig. 3The 16 C-terminal amino acids of the intracytoplasmic domain of FcγRIIB1 bind in vitro to Grb2 and Grap, which coprecipitate with phosphorylated FcγRIIB1 in vivo.

Agarose beads coated with C-ter (nonphosphorylated) or pC-ter (phosphorylated) peptides corresponding to the 16 C-terminal amino acids of FcγRIIB were incubated with IIA1.6 cell lysate. Precipitated material was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with anti-SHIP1, anti-Nckβ, anti-Nck, anti-CrkL, anti-Grap, and anti-Grb2 antibodies. Whole cell lysate (WCL) was used as a positive control. B, in vitro binding of adapter-containing GST fusion proteins to FcγRIIB C-ter peptides.

Precipitated material was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted (WB) with anti-GST antibodies. D, coprecipitation of adapters with wt FcγRIIB1 in IIA1.6 transfectants. Cells were stimulated (+) or not stimulated (–) with RatAM IgG or treated with pervanadate for 3 min. Cells were lysed, and FcγRIIB were precipitated with 2.4G2.

WCL, whole cell lysate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Peptides and in Vitro Binding of Proteins—Biotinylated peptides corresponding to the FcγRIIB ITIM, either phosphorylated (pITIM) or not phosphorylated (ITIM), and to the FcγRIIB 16 C-terminal amino acids, either phosphorylated (pC-ter) or not phosphorylated (C-ter), were purchased from Sigma-Genosys (The Woodlands, TX). The peptides were coupled to streptavidin-agarose beads. Beads were incubated for 2 h with lysates from 1 × 107 IIA1.6 cells or 2 × 107 DT40 cells or with soluble GST fusion proteins. Eluates from beads were treated as described under the subheading “Western Blot Analysis.”RESULTSThe ITIM Is Necessary but Not Sufficient for FcγRIIB to Recruit SHIP1—Because we reported previously that a deletion of the 16 C-terminal amino acids of the FcγRIIB1 intracytoplasmic domain (FcγRIIB1 Δ314) abolished the coprecipitation of SHIP1 with the receptor (29Fong D.C. Brauweiler A. Minskoff S.A. Bruhns P. Tamir I. Mellman I. Daëron M. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4453-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and because the deleted sequence contains a tyrosine residue, we examined the respective contributions of the ITIM tyrosine and the C-terminal tyrosine of FcγRIIB in the recruitment of SHIP1. FcγRIIB1 bearing a point mutation of either the ITIM tyrosine (FcγRIIB1 Y309G) or the C-terminal tyrosine (FcγRIIB1 Y326F) were stably expressed in the FcγR-negative variant of the murine B lymphoma A20/2J, IIA1.6. IIA1.6 transfectants expressing wild-type (wt) FcγRIIB1 were used as positive controls (Fig. 1A). Wild-type and mutant FcγRIIB1 were coaggregated with BCR using intact RabAM IgG antibodies that can bind both to BCR via their Fab portions and to FcγRIIB1 via their Fc portion. FcγRIIB1 were immunoprecipitated, and immunoprecipitates were Western blotted with anti-FcγRIIB, anti-phosphotyrosine, and anti-SHIP1 antibodies. Wild-type and mutant FcγRIIB1 became tyrosyl-phosphorylated following coaggregation with BCR. Compared with wt FcγRIIB1, FcγRIIB1 mutants were less phosphorylated. The coprecipitation of SHIP1 with phosphorylated wt FcγRIIB1 was lost not only in cells expressing FcγRIIB1 Y309G, as expected, but also in cells expressing FcγRIIB1 Y326F, although the ITIM remained intact in this mutant (Fig. 1B). As observed previously (29Fong D.C. Brauweiler A. Minskoff S.A. Bruhns P. Tamir I. Mellman I. Daëron M. Cambier J.C. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 4453-4462Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the coprecipitation of SHIP1 and SHIP2 was also lost in cells expressing FcγRIIB1 Δ314 (supplemental Fig. S1, found in the on-line version of this article).Fig. 1The C-terminal tyrosine (Tyr-326) of the intracytoplasmic domain of FcγRIIB1 is mandatory for SHIP1 coprecipitation. A, schematic representation of the FcγRIIB mutants and peptides used in this study. Amino acid sequence of the ITIM and C-ter peptides are indicated in black and white, respectively. Histograms show the expression of wt and mutated FcγRIIB1 assessed by indirect immunofluorescence. Bold histograms, 2.4G2 and FITC-mouse anti-rat F(ab′)2; thin histograms, FITC-mouse anti-rat F(ab′)2 only. EC, extracellular; TM, transmembrane; IC, intracellular. B, coprecipitation of SHIP1 with wt and mutated FcγRIIB1 in IIA1.6 transfectants. Cells were stimulated (+) or not stimulated (–) with R2AM IgG for 3 min. Cells were lysed, and FcγRIIB1 were precipitated with 2.4G2. Immunoprecipitates (IP) were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted (WB) with anti-FcγRIIB, anti-pTyr, and anti-SHIP1 antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)This loss of a detectable coprecipitation of SHIP1 with FcγRIIB1 Y326F was correlated with a loss of inhibition of ERK activation. ERK phosphorylation, induced upon BCR aggregation, was indeed decreased upon the coaggregation of BCR with wt FcγRIIB1 but not upon the coaggregation of BCR with either FcγRIIB1 Y309G or FcγRIIB1 Y326F (Fig. 2A).Akt phosphorylation, which was induced upon BCR aggregation, was abolished upon the coaggregation of BCR with wt FcγRIIB1 and was partially inhibited upon the coaggregation of BCR with FcγRIIB1 Y309G, FcγRIIB1 Y326F (Fig. 2B), or FcγRIIB1 Δ314 (supplemental Fig. S2A, available in the on-line version of this article). To understand how FcγRIIB1 mutants could still inhibit Akt activation to some extent, we analyzed the colocalization of SHIP1 with wt or mutant FcγRIIB1 by confocal microscopy (supplemental Fig. S2, B and C). As observed previously (36Phee H. Rodgers W. Coggeshall K.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8615-8625Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), SHIP1 colocalized with BCR-wt FcγRIIB1 coaggregates in >80% of the cells. The colocalization of SHIP1 with either BCR-FcγRIIB1 Δ314 or BCR-FcγRIIB1 Y309G coaggregates was reduced but could still be observed in 40–50% of the cells. Altogether, these data indicate that the tyrosine contained in the C-terminal sequence of FcγRIIB1 contributes to the recruitment of SHIP1 and to FcγRIIB-dependent inhibition of ERK and Akt activation.FcγRIIB Contain a Second Tyrosine-based Motif That Binds the Adapters Grb2/Grap in Vitro, and FcγRIIB Recruit These Adapters in Vivo—The C-terminal tyrosine of FcγRIIB is within a consensus Grb2-binding site. Indeed, phosphorylated peptides corresponding to the 16 C-terminal amino acids of FcγRIIB that were deleted in FcγRIIB1 Δ314 (pC-ter), but not the same non-phosphorylated peptides (C-ter), precipitated Grb2 and Grap from a IIA1.6 cell lysate but not the related adapters Nck, Nckβ, or CrkL, which were all present in the lysate (Fig. 3A). pC-ter, but not C-ter, bound to GST fusion proteins containing Grb2 or Grap (Fig. 3B). Finally, pC-ter, but not C-ter, also bound to a GST fusion protein containing the SH2 domain of Grb2. This GST-Grb2 SH2 fusion protein failed to bind to a phosphorylated peptide corresponding to the FcγRIIB ITIM (pITIM). Conversely, a GST fusion protein containing the SH2 domain of SHIP1 bound to pITIM but not to pC-ter (Fig. 3C). These data indicate that pC-ter can bind to the adapters Grb2 and Grap but not to SHIP1."
https://openalex.org/W2168824394,"Smooth muscle caldesmon binds actin and inhibits actomyosin ATPase activity. Phosphorylation of caldesmon by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) reverses this inhibitory effect and weakens actin binding. To better understand this function, we have examined the phosphorylation-dependent contact sites of caldesmon on actin by low dose electron microscopy and three-dimensional reconstruction of actin filaments decorated with a C-terminal fragment, hH32K, of human caldesmon containing the principal actin-binding domains. Helical reconstruction of negatively stained filaments demonstrated that hH32K is located on the inner portion of actin subdomain 1, traversing its upper surface toward the C-terminal segment of actin, and forms a bridge to the neighboring actin monomer of the adjacent long pitch helical strand by connecting to its subdomain 3. Such lateral binding was supported by cross-linking experiments using a mutant isoform, which was capable of cross-linking actin subunits. Upon ERK phosphorylation, however, the mutant no longer cross-linked actin to polymers. Three-dimensional reconstruction of ERK-phosphorylated hH32K indeed indicated loss of the interstrand connectivity. These results, together with fluorescence quenching data, are consistent with a phosphorylation-dependent conformational change that moves the C-terminal end segment of caldesmon near the phosphorylation site but not the upstream region around Cys595, away from F-actin, thus neutralizing its inhibitory effect on actomyosin interactions. The binding pattern of hH32K suggests a mechanism by which unphosphorylated, but not ERK-phosphorylated, caldesmon could stabilize actin filaments and resist F-actin severing or depolymerization in both smooth muscle and nonmuscle cells. Smooth muscle caldesmon binds actin and inhibits actomyosin ATPase activity.

The binding pattern of hH32K suggests a mechanism by which unphosphorylated, but not ERK-phosphorylated, caldesmon could stabilize actin filaments and resist F-actin severing or depolymerization in both smooth muscle and nonmuscle cells.

In nonmuscle cells it influences contractility by interfering with focal adhesion and stress fiber assembly (1Helfman D.M. Levy E.T. Berthier C. Shtutman M. Riveline D. Gro-sheva I. Lachish-Zalait A.

Cell Sci. 2004; 29Google Scholar). In smooth muscle, CaD is found on thin filaments within the contractile domain (3Fürst D.O. Cross R.A. De Mey J. Small J.V. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) where it suppresses basal muscle tone by inhibiting active cross-bridge cycling (4Earley J.J. Su X. Moreland R.S. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 661-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), providing fine tuning of the contractility under diverse physiological conditions. The mechanism by which CaD impinges on smooth muscle contractility and whether CaD function is subject to regulation in vivo, however, remain contentious issues (5Marston S. Burton D. Copeland O.

Herring B.P. Kamm K.E. Hyper-tension. 1991; 17: 723-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Much of the structural information regarding CaD has been garnered from the study of the smooth muscle isoform, h-CaD, which was originally identified as a calmodulin (CaM)-binding protein that also binds filamentous actin (F-actin) (10Sobue K. Muramoto Y. Fujita M. Kakiuchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5652-5655Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In native smooth muscle thin filaments, h-CaD binds lengthwise along the actin filaments with a periodicity of 38 nm (11Lehman W. Craig R. Lui J. Moody C. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1989; 10: 101-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), although its length (75 nm) (12Graceffa P. Wang C.-L. A. Stafford W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14196-14202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is sufficient to span two actin heptads. This is most likely due to staggered binding of h-CaD to the two actin strands (13Marston S.B. Redwood C.S. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies of purified h-CaD demonstrate that it has three functionally distinct domains: an N-terminal domain that harbors the major myosin-binding sites (14Velaz L. Ingraham R.H.

In the presence of Ca2+, CaM reverses the binding of CaD to actin (10Sobue K. Muramoto Y. Fujita M. Kakiuchi S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Commun. 1986; 136: 962-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The affinity between CaD and CaM, however, is only moderate (∼106m-1) (32Shirinsky V.P. Bushueva T.L. Frolova S.I. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 203-208PubMed Google Scholar). Although it has been shown that sufficiently high local intracellular concentrations of CaM do exist in both smooth muscle (33Hulvershorn J. Gallant C.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2513-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 45Patchell V.B. Vorotnikov A.V. Gao Y. Low D.G. Evans J.S. Fattoum A. El-Mezgueldi M. Marston S.B. Levine B.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1596: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), thus providing another mechanism to regulate the function of CaD. Evidence for regulation of CaD by phosphorylation in vivo has come from work on nonmuscle cells and differentiated smooth muscle. Matsumura and colleagues (40Yamashiro S. Yamakita Y. Hosoya H. Matsumura F. Nature. 1991; 349: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) showed that phosphorylation by cdc2 kinase during mitosis caused l-CaD to dissociate from microfilaments in proliferating fibroblasts. Working with differentiated smooth muscle, Adam et al. (46Adam L.P. Gapinski C.J. Hathaway D.R. FEBS Lett. 1992; 302: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) demonstrated that 32P-labeled h-CaD, purified from phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate-stimulated canine aortic smooth muscle, was phosphorylated at sites VTS*PTKV and S*PAPK within its C terminus (Ser759 and Ser789 by the mammalian numbering scheme). Subsequent work has shown that Ser789 is the pre-ponderate site of h-CaD phosphorylation in porcine carotid artery strips (47D'Angelo G. Graceffa P. Wang C.-L. A. Wrangle J. Adam L.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30115-30121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These sequences conform to the consensus motif S(T)PXP that constitutes the preferred target site for the family of “proline-directed” kinases, of which cdc2 kinase and ERK are prototypes. ERK has been purified from smooth muscle (48Childs T.J. Mak A.S. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1993; 71: 544-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), and its activation in smooth muscle has been studied (49Franklin M.T. Wang C.-L. A. Adam L.P. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: C1819-C1827Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 50Hedges J.C. Oxhorn B.C. Carty M. Adam L.P. Yamboliev I.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C718-C726Crossref Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been shown that Ca2+-free stimulation of ferret aortic smooth muscle cells, with phenylephrine, resulted in the recruitment of ERK to the plasma membrane, phosphorylation of tyrosine (thereby activating the kinase), and redistribution to CaD-decorated thin filaments (51Khalil R.A. Menice C.B. Wang C.-L. A. Morgan K.G. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 1101-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Taken together these studies implicate ERK as an endogenous CaD kinase. Further understanding of the mechanism of action of CaD has been afforded by electron microscopy and three-dimensional helical image reconstruction. Addition of a 150-residue C-terminal CaD fragment, 606C, to reconstituted actin·Tm filaments caused Tm to move from its position on the inner aspect of the outer domain of actin, toward the inner domain of actin (52Hodgkinson J.L. Marston S.B. Craig R. Vibert P. Lehman W. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 2398-2404Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This indicates that CaD affects the conformation of actin·Tm differently than the striated muscle regulatory protein, troponin. Subsequent studies of optimally negatively stained native chicken gizzard thin filaments revealed density on the outer domain of actin on subdomains 1 and 2 that was attributed to CaD (53Lehman W. Vibert P. Craig R. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 274: 310-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, image density was weak, likely because of incomplete saturation of actin filaments, which may have resulted from partial dissociation of CaD during the purification process. Thus although the difference density map was generated between CaD-bound and CaD-free filaments (after incubation with Ca2+/CaM), ambiguity remains with regard to the assignment of the binding position of CaD. To determine the conformation of the C-terminal domain of CaD on purified actin, such that contact regions on F-actin could be assigned unambiguously, and to test whether phosphorylation of this region by ERK, a physiologically relevant event, alters its conformation on actin, we have undertaken the present study. Our data reveal actin-CaD contacts that have not been detected previously and demonstrate that phosphorylation affects the conformation of actin-bound CaD. These reconstructed images, corroborated by results from fluorescence quenching and cross-linking experiments, support a model where the C-terminal region of CaD interacts with actin via two clusters of contact points, one of which dissociates from actin upon phosphorylation, resulting in the loss of inhibition on actomyosin interaction (44Huang R. Li L. Guo H. Wang C.-L. A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2513-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Because this C-terminal domain is shared by both CaD isoforms, the observed conformational change may serve as a common mechanism for regulating the function of CaD in smooth muscle and nonmuscle cells. Cloning and Expression of C-terminal Fragments of CaD—The His6-tagged C-terminal region of chicken gizzard CaD (H32K, residues Met563-Pro771, using the corrected numbering system; see Ref. 54Guo H. Bryan J. Wang C.-L. A. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1999; 20: 725-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and its variant, H32Kqc (with Gln766 mutated to Cys) were prepared as described previously (44Huang R. Li L. Guo H. Wang C.-L. A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2513-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Gln766 was chosen for mutagenesis because it is in the region of, yet not too close to, the ERK phosphorylation site (Ser717). Another mutant, H32Kqc/ca, in which Cys595 and GLn766 are simultaneously mutated to Ala and Cys, respectively, was prepared by the same procedure. Thus the wild-type H32K and the double mutant H32Kqc/ca each contain a single cysteine, whereas H32Kqc has two cysteine residues. The mammalian homolog (hH32K) corresponding to residues Leu604-Val793 of human CaD with a His6 tag at the N terminus was expressed in High-Five cells and purified on a Ni2+ column followed by a CaM affinity column (44Huang R. Li L. Guo H. Wang C.-L. A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2513-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As in the previous work, mutagenesis in hH32K was not attempted, because Gln766 does not exist in the mammalian sequence, and there is no suitable mutation site near the phosphorylation sites. ERK Phosphorylation of C-terminal Fragments of CaD—Phosphorylation of both chicken and human CaD fragments was carried out using purified proteins and recombinant ERK2 (New England BioLabs, Inc.) in the manufacturer-supplied 1× MAPK buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm DTT, and 0.01% Brij35), and ascertained by mass spectrometric analysis as described previously (44Huang R. Li L. Guo H. Wang C.-L. A. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 2513-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Although ERK phosphorylates hH32K at both Ser759 and Ser789, H32K is only phosphorylated at Ser717 (which corresponds to Ser759 in the mammalian sequence), because the other site is absent in the chicken sequence. Sample Preparation for Electron Microscopy—Filamentous rabbit skeletal actin (5 μl of 1 μm; prepared as described in Ref. 55Pardee J.D. Spudich J.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1982; 24: 271-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar) in 5 mm PIPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 3.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.02% NaN3 and 0.5 mm DTT was applied to carbon-coated microscope grids. The actin solution was wicked down to a volume of ∼0.5 μl, allowing F-actin to adsorb weakly to the grid surface before a solution of hH32K (5 μl of ≥5 μm; in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μm leupeptin) was added to the grid. The grids were then allowed to stand for 5-15 min at room temperature (22 °C) in a chamber, maintained at a relative humidity of 70-80% to minimize sample evaporation prior to staining. The samples were stained with 1% uranyl acetate. This method, which involves partial adsorption of F-actin to the grid surface, thus restricting freedom of F-actin movement, was used to circumvent bundling of actin by the CaD fragment that occurred when the proteins were simply mixed together and applied to the grids. Inclusion of 0.5-1.0 mm DTT in the buffers had no effect on actin bundling, and attempts to minimize bundling by increasing the ionic strength binding weakened binding of hH32K concomitantly, confounding the search for decorated filaments. Electron Microscopy and Image Reconstruction—Electron micrograph images of decorated filaments were recorded on a Philips CM120 electron microscope at 60,000× magnification under low dose conditions (12 e-/Å2). The micrographs were digitized using a SCAI scanner at a pixel size corresponding to 0.7 nm in the filaments (56Hatch V. Zhi G. Smith L. Stull J.T. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 611-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In the current study, filaments were chosen for analysis if the stain surrounding them was well spread and even and if the filaments lacked distortions, discontinuities, or overlying contaminants. Areas displaying astigmatism or specimen drift were not processed, and curved filaments were straightened by applying spline-fitting algorithms (57Egelman E.H. Ultramicroscopy. 1986; 19: 367-373Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Helical reconstruction was carried out using standard methods (58DeRosier D.J. Moore P.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1970; 52: 355-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, 59Amos L.A. Klug A. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 99: 51-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 60Owen C.H. Morgan D.G. DeRosier D.J. J. Struct. Biol. 1996; 116: 167-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) as described previously (61Vibert P. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 313-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 62Vibert P. Craig R. Lehman W. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 266: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Layer line data extended to a resolution of ∼25-30 Å, and no data were collected beyond 23 Å. The maps of actin-hH32K and actin-phospho-hH32K filaments were each generated by calculating the average amplitudes and phases along layer lines of Fourier transforms determined for 19 filaments from two hH32K and two phospho-hH32K preparations. Maps of individual filaments were averaged after aligning them to each other by iterative rotation and translation in reciprocal space to attain a common phase origin (63Amos L.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1975; 99: 65-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Photo-cross-linking Experiments—Cross-linking between CaD and actin was achieved by using a photo-cross-linker, benzophenone maleimide (BPM). To protect the photo-sensitive reagent, all of the photo-cross-linking experiments were performed in the dark. Both the phosphorylated (by ERK2 for ≥4 h at room temperature) and unphosphorylated H32K fragments were first reduced with 10 mm DTT for 1 h at room temperature and extensively dialyzed to remove DTT against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. To the sample 5-fold molar excess of BPM was added from a 20 mm stock solution in dimethylformamide, and the mixture was rotated for 5 h at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with 5 mm DTT, and the reaction mixture was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl. BPM-labeled H32K fragments and actin were mixed typically in a 1:5 ratio in F-buffer (50 mm NaCl 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.4 mm ATP, 2 mm MgCl2, 2 mm DTT, 2 mm HEPES, pH 7.5). Ultraviolet irradiation was carried out in a Rayonet RPR-100 photochemical reactor equipped with sixteen 3500 lamps (Southern New England Ultraviolet, Hamden, CT) at 4 °C for 15 min, and the thin filaments were centrifuged at 85,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. The cross-linked products in both pellet and supernatant fractions were analyzed with 10% or 4-20% gradient SDS-polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad). The apparent molecular mass of the gel bands was calculated using the mobility of the molecular mass markers (Bio-Rad) on the same gel as standards. Disulfide Cross-linking Experiments—To disulfide cross-link H32K mutants to actin, we have made use of the ability to cross-link actin Cys374 to CaD Cys595 with the reagent NbS2 (64Graceffa P. Jancso A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20305-20310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NbS2 can catalyze disulfide bond formation between two nearby thiol groups by means of disulfide exchange. G-actin Cys374 was first activated by reacting with NbS2 as described previously (64Graceffa P. Jancso A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20305-20310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 65Graceffa P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30187-30193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), except that G-actin monomer was used in place of filamentous F-actin. The resulting NbS-G-actin was then polymerized to F-actin by adding NaCl to 40 mm and MgCl2 to 2 mm (F-buffer). Unphosphorylated or ERK2-phosphorylated CaD fragments (H32K, H32Kqc, and H32Kqc/ca) were reduced with 10 mm DTT and then exhaustively dialyzed against a buffer containing 40 mm NaCl, 5 mm Mops, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm EDTA, and 0.01% NaN3. The disulfide reaction between NbS-F-actin (∼14 μm) and CaD fragments, together with gizzard smooth muscle Tm, was carried out at room temperature in F-buffer with a molar ratio of 1:2:14 CaD fragment:Tm:actin. The reaction was quenched at specific times with 2 mmN-ethylmaleimide to block all available cysteine residues. The reaction products were separated on SDS-PAGE with the running gel containing 2 mm CaCl2, which results in the resolution of the αTm band from actin (66Nishida W. Abe M. Takahashi K. Hiwada K. FEBS Lett. 1990; 268: 165-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 67Graceffa P. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11984-11992Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The bands of the cross-linked products were excised from the gel, incubated with 100 mm DTT, and reapplied to SDS-PAGE. A reaction mixture without CaD was used as a control. Quenching Experiments—Unphosphorylated and ERK-phosphorylated H32K fragments were first treated with 10 mm DTTfor1hat room temperature and extensively dialyzed to remove DTT against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. A 5-fold molar excess of 1,5-IAEDANS was added from a 20 mm stock solution in dimethylformamide, and the samples were rotated for 4 h at room temperature. The reaction was quenched with 5 mm DTT, and the samples were dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl. After labeling, the H32K fragments were mixed with F-actin in F-buffer. Aliquots of acrylamide solution were then added to the mixture, and the fluorescence intensity was measured in a 1-cm-path length cuvette (λexc = 335 nm; λem = 494 nm). Analysis was done with KaleidaGragh software. Electron Microscopy of F-actin-hH32K Complexes—F-actin was complexed with a polypeptide containing the C-terminal 189 residues of human h-CaD (hH32K), under conditions to maximize saturation of F-actin filaments with the protein. Electron micrographs of negatively stained filaments showed that hH32K caused F-actin to form tight bundles. Bundling was minimized, but not eliminated, by applying F-actin to the sample grids prior to incubation with hH32K or phospho-hH32K (see “Materials and Methods”). Only unbundled filaments were analyzed. Actin substructure, although evident, was frequently obscured by the binding of the hH32K on the surface of filaments (Fig. 1, b and c), which also caused them to appear wider than pure F-actin. Globular structures were occasionally seen projecting from filaments, but details of the shape, orientation, and periodicity of the hH32K were not discernable. To detect the hH32K binding and determine its position on F-actin, image processing and three-dimensional reconstruction were therefore necessary. Three-dimensional Reconstructions of Reconstituted Thin Filaments—Filaments bearing hH32K, from two preparations, were negatively stained as described under “Materials and Methods.” The data arising from different hH32K preparations were pooled because they were highly similar. Density maps of reconstituted filaments were calculated from the averages of the Fourier transform layer line data (not shown). All of the maps obtained showed typical two-domain actin monomers that could be further divided into identifiable subdomains 1, 2, 3, and 4 (see labeling in Fig. 2a). When compared with the maps generated from pure F-actin, each separately calculated reconstruction of F-actin-hH32K showed obvious extra density lying on subdomain 1, reaching around the back of the subdomain and ultimately spanning to the inner domain of the neighboring monomer (n - 1) down in the adjacent long pitch helical strand of F-actin. Inspection of the surface views averaged from 19 hH32K-bearing actin filaments (Fig. 2b) showed that hH32"

Methanococcus jannaschii Lon (Mj-Lon) is a homologue of Escherichia coli Lon (Ec-Lon) but has two transmembrane helices within its N-terminal ATPase domain. We solved the crystal structure of the proteolytic domain of Mj-Lon using multiwavelength anomalous dispersion, refining it to 1.9-Å resolution. The structure displays an overall fold conserved in the proteolytic domain of Ec-Lon; however, the active site shows uniquely configured catalytic Ser-Lys-Asp residues that are not seen in Ec-Lon, which contains a catalytic dyad. In Mj-Lon, the C-terminal half of the β4-α2 segment is an α-helix, whereas it is a β-strand in Ec-Lon. Consequently, the configurations of the active sites differ due to the formation of a salt bridge between Asp-547 and Lys-593 in Mj-Lon. Moreover, unlike Ec-Lon, Mj-Lon has a buried cavity in the region of the active site containing three water molecules, one of which is hydrogen-bonded to catalytic Ser-550. The geometry and environment of the active site residues in Mj-Lon suggest that the charged Lys-593 assists in lowering the pKa of the Ser-550 hydroxyl group via its electrostatic potential, and the water in the cavity acts as a proton acceptor during catalysis. Extensive sequence alignment and comparison of the structures of the proteolytic domains clearly indicate that Lon proteases can be classified into two groups depending on active site configuration and the presence of DGPSA or (D/E)GDSA consensus sequences, as represented by Ec-Lon and Mj-Lon.

In all cells, energy-dependent proteolysis plays a key role in the rapid turnover of short-lived regulatory proteins and in the elimination of defective and denatured proteins (1Wickner S. Maurizi M.R. Gottesman S. Science. 1999; 286: 1888-1893Crossref PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Bacterial cells possess a number of ATP-dependent proteases, which are complex enzymes containing both ATPase and proteolytic activity as separate domains within a single polypeptide or as individual subunits within complex assemblies. Escherichia coli, for example, express five different ATP-dependent proteases: Lon, ClpAP, ClpXP, HslUV (ClpYQ), and FtSH (2Gottesman S. Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Homologous proteases have also been identified in archaea and eubacteria, as well as in numerous eukaryotes. Some archaeal Lons have one or two putative transmembrane regions, suggesting that they are membrane-associated (3Fukui T. Eguchi T. Atomi H. Imanaka T. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 3689-3698Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The proteolytic components of ATP-dependent proteases include several different types of active sites. For instance, ClpP is a classical serine protease (4Wang J. Hartling J.A. Flanagan J.M. Cell. 1997; 91: 447-456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar), whereas HslV has a catalytic N-terminal Thr residue (5Yoo S.J. Shim Y.K. Seong I.S. Seol J.H. Kang M.S. Chung C.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 412: 57-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Lon was the first ATP-dependent protease to be described (6Swamy K.H. Goldberg A.L. Nature. 1981; 292: 652-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Similar to the molecular chaperon, Lon recognizes a broad range of proteins and mediates their turnover of abnormal and short-lived normal proteins. Indeed, through degradation of various specialized proteins, Lon is involved in the regulation of a number of biological functions (7Gottesman S. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1996; 30: 465-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (606) Google Scholar). Moreover, it also reportedly acts as a DNA-binding protein, influencing the regulation of DNA replication and gene expression (8Fu G.K. Smith M.J. Markovitz D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 534-538Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). E. coli Lon (Ec-Lon) 1The abbreviations used are: Ec-Lon, E. coli Lon; Mj-Lon, M. jannaschii Lon; MES, 4-morpholine ethane sulfonic acid; Se-Met, selenomethionine; r.m.s., root mean square. is an 87-kDa protein containing N-terminal ATPase and C-terminal protease domains on a single polypeptide chain that is found as a homooligomer (9Goldberg A.L. Moerschell R.P. Chung C.H. Maurizi M.R. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 350-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), although the oligomeric states of intact Lon were not reported consistently. Still, recent observations suggest that Lon isoforms from several sources self-associate into hexameric or heptameric rings (10Lee A.Y. Tsay S.S. Chen M.Y. Wu S.H. Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 834-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar, 11Stahlberg H. Kutejova E. Suda K. Wolpensinger B. Lustig A. Schatz G. Engel A. Suzuki C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Sequence comparisons suggest that Lon contains a catalytic Ser-Lys dyad, and the first crystal structure of the proteolytic domain from Ec-Lon confirmed the presence of a catalytic Ser-Lys dyad within a unique structural fold, distinct from that of the classical serine proteases (13Birghan C. Mundt E. Gorbalenya A.E. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 114-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar, 14Botos I. Melnikov E.E. Cherry S. Tropea J.E. Khalatova A.G. Rasulova F. Dauter Z. Maurizi M.R.

In the present study, however, we found that the Mj-Lon proteolytic domain employs a unique catalytic Ser-Lys-Asp triad. Extensive sequence alignment and comparison of the structures of their proteolytic domains clearly indicate that Lon proteases can be classified into two groups depending on the configuration of the catalytic residues in the active site, as represented by Ec-Lon and Mj-Lon. Protein Expression and Purification—Full-length Lon protease was cloned by PCR using a Methanococcus jannaschii genomic library as a template. The resultant product was cloned into the NcoI and XhoI sites of pET28b vector (Novagen). The coding regions for the proteolytic domain of Mj-Lon (residues 456-649) were then amplified from a plasmid harboring the full-length lon gene and cloned into the NdeI and XhoI sites of pET28b. The resultant construct provides for an N-terminal His6 tag separated from the protein by a thrombin protease recognition site (LVP(R/G)S). The fusion protein was overexpressed in E. coli BL21(DE3). The cells were grown in LB at 37 °C to an A600 ∼0.8, at which time expression was induced using 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Growth was continued at 30 °C for 6 h, after which the cells were harvested, resuspended in binding buffer (500 mm NaCl and 50 mm NaH2PO4 (pH 7.5)), and broken by sonication. The lysate was then run on an immobilized nickel affinity column, after which the column was washed with binding buffer, and the fusion protein was eluted in buffer comprised of the binding buffer plus 500 mm imidazole. After concentration, the tag was cleaved from the protein by treating it with thrombin protease at room temperature overnight, and the cleaved protein was subjected to size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 200 column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) plus 50 mm NaCl. The fractions containing the recombinant protein were pooled and concentrated to 9 mg/ml. To prepare the Se-Met-enriched protein, the protease domain of Mj-Lon was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) using saturation of the Met biosynthetic pathways protocols due to poor growth of the Met auxotroph strain E. coli B834(DE3) in supplemented M9 medium (15Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). Crystallization—The proteolytic domain of Mj-Lon was crystallized at room temperature (20 ± 1 °C) using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. Initial seeds of multiple twinned crystals were grown on a siliconized coverslip by equilibrating a mixture containing 2 μl of protein solution (4.5 mg/ml protein in 50 mm NaCl and 10 mm MES-NaOH (pH 8.0)) and an equal volume of well solution (2.4 m ammonium sulfate and 100 mm MES-NaOH (pH 7.0)) against 1.0 ml of well solution. Under the same crystallization conditions, crystals were grown by microseeding with or without subsequent macroseeding to increase the size of single crystals. Within 1 week, single crystals grew to dimensions of 0.1 × 0.2 × 1.0 mm and were flash-frozen by direct transfer to Pratone-N cryoprotectant solution (Hampton Research). Crystallographic Analysis—Se-Met multiwavelength anomalous diffraction data (Table I) were collected to 2.3-Å resolution from a single frozen crystal with an ADSC Quantum 4R CCD detector at beamline BL-18B at the Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan. The data set was processed and scaled using HKL2000 packages (16Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38570) Google Scholar) and then handled with the CCP4 program suite (17Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19768) Google Scholar). A second native data set from a Se-Met-labeled crystal was collected to 1.9-Å resolution with an ADSC Quantum Q210 CCD detector at beamline AR-NW12. Multiwavelength anomalous diffraction phasing was carried out using the programs SOLVE and RESOLVE (18Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1763-1775Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Despite the low proportion of anomalous scatter and the presence of only two Se-Mets among 388 residues, the resultant electron density map, showing a dimer in an asymmetric unit, was readily interpretable. Automatic model building was then carried out using the program MAID (19Levitt D.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2001; 57: 1013-1019Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), with which 88% of the structure was modeled. A partial model containing 342 residues was refined using the program CNS (20Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S.

Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar) for several cycles of B-factor refinement and simulated annealing. Model phases from the partial model were then applied to the 1.9-Å data sets. Subsequent density modification of CNS yielded an electron density map of excellent quality showing a clear trace of all the residues except for 9 residues at the C termini. The remainder of the model was built manually into the density-modified map using the program O (21Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). The refinement of the native structure was completed with CNS to a final crystallographic R-factor of 22.6% and an Rfree of 26.3%. The final model covers residues 456-640. The stereochemistry of the model was analyzed using PROCHECK (22Morris A.L. MacArthur M.W. Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Proteins. 1992; 12: 345-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar), which showed no residue to be in a disallowed region.Table IData collection and refinement statisticsData setSeMet-MADNativeCrystal formP42212P42212Cell parameter a, c (Å)92.16, 101.6889.85, 100.61X-ray sourcePF BL-18BPF AR-NW12Wavelengthλ 1 = 0.9780λ 2 = 0.9785λ3 = 0.99401.000Resolution (Å)50–2.350–1.9Mean I/σ(I)27.6 (7.6)27.8 (7.8)28.0 (7.6)29.8 (3.1)RsymaRsym = Σ|〈I〉 – I|/Σ〈I〉(%)9.6 (34.3)9.3 (33.4)9.3 (34.1)5.3 (35.7)CompletenessbValues in parentheses relate to the highest resolution shell(%)98.9 (98.6)98.9 (98.8)98.9 (97.8)99.9 (98.4)Phasing statisticsNumber of selenium site2/388 amino acidsMean FOM (SOLVE)0.40Overall FOM (RESOLVE)0.56RefinementRcrystcRcryst = Σ‖Fo| – |Fc‖/Σ|Fo| total (%)22.6RfreedRfree calculated with 5% of all reflections excluded from the refinement stages total (%)26.3r.m.s. bond length (Å)0.005r.m.s. bond angle (°)1.3Average B value (Å2)25.7a Rsym = Σ|〈I〉 – I|/Σ〈I〉b Values in parentheses relate to the highest resolution shellc Rcryst = Σ‖Fo| – |Fc‖/Σ|Fo|d Rfree calculated with 5% of all reflections excluded from the refinement stages Open table in a new tab Description of the Structure—Like other Lon proteases from various sources, the 71.9-kDa Mj-Lon contains an N-terminal ATPase domain and a C-terminal protease domain. The ATPase domain of Mj-Lon containing two transmembrane helices shows low overall similarity to its bacterial and eukaryotic counterparts. As compared with the ATPase domains, the proteolytic domains are well conserved over all Lon families with 40% of the minimal pairwise homology. The proteolytic domain of Mj-Lon shares 29% identity and 49% similarity with the proteolytic domain of Ec-Lon over 193 amino acids. In the present study, we determined the crystal structure of the proteolytic domain of Mj-Lon (residues 456-649) using multiwavelength anomalous dispersion and refined it to 1.9-Å resolution. The structure of the proteolytic domain consists of five α-helices and nine β-strands (Fig. 1A). The N-terminal β1 strand and antiparallel β2 strand form a long β-hairpin loop. The parallel β3 and β4 strands, which are connected by the longest helix (α1), form the first large β-sheet with the β1 and β2 strands. The subsequent helix α2 is kinked at Ser-550, which is a catalytic residue in this enzyme. Helices α1 and α2 interact with the first β-sheet, forming a compact N-terminal subdomain. The other subdomain, which is connected by a random loop (α2-β5), is composed of three parallel β-strands (β5, β8, and β9) surrounded by three α-helices. A β-hairpin loop composed of strands β6 and β7 connects strand β5 with helix α3, and subsequent strands and helices alternate along the primary structure. The crystal structure of Mj-Lon showed that each asymmetric unit contains two molecules forming a dimer with a non-crystallographic 2-fold axis, presumably corresponding to the dimer in solution during purification. The dimeric structure of the proteolytic domain of Mj-Lon resembles a pair of lungs when viewed from the vertical with respect to the 2-fold axis (Fig. 1B). The dimer interface consists of a β-hairpin loop connecting strand β5, helices α3 and α4, the C-terminal end of helix α3, and 5 residues in the N-terminal subdomain from each monomer. The surface area buried upon dimer formation is 655 Å2, or 7.5% of the total surface area of each monomer. The interface is composed of 64.0% nonpolar atoms and 35.0% polar atoms, and within the dimer, the monomers are held together by two hydrogen bonds and numerous van der Waals interactions. It is questionable, however, whether the crystal structure of the dimer is consistent with the assembly of proteolytic domains in the intact Lon protease. This is because the active sites of the two monomers are both completely buried within the interface, preventing exposure of catalytic residues to the solvent unless the interface undergoes a marked conformational change. Considering that there are hydrophobic patches around active sites, it may be that dimerization of these proteolytic domains through hydrophobic interactions occurs in the absence of the ATPase domains. Also, given that obstruction of the active sites of the Mj-Lon proteolytic domains by dimerization is not reasonable in vivo, it seems likely that the observed dimeric structure is artifactual. Therefore, despite the presence of intact active site in the proteolytic domain, the dimerization might lead to loss of proteolytic activity. The truncation of N-terminal domain in Brevibacillus thermoruber Lon protease resulted in the failure of oligomerization and led to the inactivation of proteolytic and ATPase activities, indicating that N-terminal domain is essential for the correct oligomerization of the protein (23Lee A.Y. Hsu C.H. Wu S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; Google Scholar). Intact Lon protease is reportedly active as a homooligomer comprised of 4-8 subunits. Lon proteases from several sources, including bovine (12Watabe S. Kimura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14498-14504Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), yeast (24van Dijl J.M. Kutejova E. Suda K. Perecko D. Schatz G. Suzuki C.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10584-10589Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), and Thermus thermophilus (25Watanabe S. Muramatsu T. Ao H. Hirayama Y. Takahashi K. Tanokura M. Kuchino Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1999; 266: 811-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), self-associate into hexameric rings. Moreover, Botos et al. (14Botos I. Melnikov E.E. Cherry S. Tropea J.E. Khalatova A.G. Rasulova F. Dauter Z. Maurizi M.R. Rotanova T.V. Wlodawer A. Gustchina A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8140-8148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) reported that the recombinant catalytic domain of Ec-Lon protease assembled into the hexameric ring structure within crystal, suggesting a hexameric configuration of the holoenzyme. Comparison of the Mj-Lon and Ec-lon Protease Domains— The overall fold of the Mj-Lon proteolytic domain is similar to that of Ec-Lon; the r.m.s. deviation is 1.22 Å for 140 equivalent Cα atoms. The configurations of the secondary structure elements are almost identical in the two structures, except for the segment between strand β4 and helix α2 (Fig. 2A). The residues extending from the middle of helix α2 to helix α3 (residues 549-594 in M. jannaschii), which contain 2 catalytic residues, are structurally well conserved, with a Cα r.m.s. deviation of 0.77 Å, and the catalytic residues, Ser-550 and Lys-593, are located at almost identical positions within each protease. The structural differences mainly originate from the loops connecting the secondary structure elements. The loop β1-β2 near the active site shows the highest conformational difference among the connecting loops. The most significant difference is in the N-terminal portion of helix α2, where the catalytic Ser residue is located. Mj-Lon protease has two additional turns of α-helix bent by 35 degrees at the N-terminal end of helix α2. In Ec-Lon, by contrast, the equivalent segment is a β-strand spanning 6 residues. Sequence comparison clearly shows that Mj-Lon has helix-forming residues in the segment between residues 542 and 550, whereas Ec-Lon has 2 Pro residues hindering the formation of α-helix (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the conserved variation in the sequence of the β4-α2 segment results in a significant difference of the configuration of the active site in the two groups of Lon proteases represented by Mj-Lon and Ec-Lon, respectively. Although both proteases have a conserved Asp residue within the β4-α2 segment, only Asp-547 of Mj-Lon is located within salt bridge distance of the catalytic Lys. Consequently, the α-helical structure of the β4-α2 segment in Mj-Lon not only changes the shape of the active site but also significantly alters the properties of the catalytic Lys through the formation of a salt bridge. Another striking feature of the Mj-Lon proteolytic domain is the presence of a cavity in each protomer containing three water molecules aligned consecutively from within hydrogen-bonding distance of the catalytic Ser-550 toward the interior of the protein (Fig. 3A). This cavity is completely buried and inaccessible from the surface of a monomeric protease domain. With a volume of 65 Å3, it contacts Ser-550 and is situated in a cleft between helix α2 and strands β1 and β5. The Ec-Lon proteolytic domain has a small cavity with a volume of 13 Å3, which contains one water molecule at a position corresponding to Wat3 of Mj-Lon. There is no contact with the active site residues, however. The known structure of the Ec-Lon proteolytic domain is that of an active site mutant (S679A), which does not faithfully represent the active site structure of the wild-type enzyme due to disruption of the hydrogen-bonding network caused by replacing the catalytic Ser-679 with an Ala. Still, the presence of additional water molecules in the cavity of wild-type Ec-Lon is not probable because the C-terminal half of the β1 strand of Ec-Lon is closer to helix α2 than that of Mj-Lon, resulting in shrinkage of the cavity surrounded by helix α2 and strands β1 and β5. Active Site—The structure of the active site shows that Mj-Lon employs a pseudocatalytic triad comprised of Ser-550, Lys-593, and Asp-547 (Fig. 3B). Asp-547 and the catalytic residue Ser-550 are located in the same face of helix α2, oriented toward Lys-593 in helix α3. Superposition of the structures of the Ec- and Mj-Lon proteolytic domains shows that Ser-550 and Lys-593 share almost identical positions in the two enzymes, but Mj-Lon has an additional residue, Asp-547, that is located in the N-terminal end of helix α2 and interacts with the catalytic residues (Fig. 2A). The carboxyl group of Asp-547 is located at the first turn of helix α2 and makes a salt bridge with Lys-593 and a hydrogen bond with a water molecule. In Ec-Lon, the Asp residue is also conserved at the sequence level, but it is exposed to the solvent and not involved with the active site residues because the segment corresponding to the N-terminal end of helix α2 is a β-strand, which puts the Asp residue at a position distant from the active site (Fig. 3C). The catalytic mechanism of the classical Ser-His-Asp triad is known to begin with the polarization of the Ser residue by the His residue, which abstracts the hydroxyl proton of the Ser residue. The Asp stabilizes the charged imidazole of the His, promoting its role as a base (26Fersht A.R. Structure and Mechanism in Protein Science: A Guide to Enzyme Catalysis and Protein Folding. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1999: 472-482Google Scholar). Conceivably, the Lys in the Ser-Lys dyad may serve the same function as the His in serine proteases. Although Ec-Lon protease has no sequence or structural similarity to signal peptidase or the LexA family of serine proteases, the Ec-Lon proteolytic domain is believed to utilize a Ser-Lys dyad mechanism similar to that used by signal peptidase, in that it has conserved geometries of the Ser-Lys dyad and a Thr residue assisting the dyad (14Botos I. Melnikov E.E. Cherry S. Tropea J.E. Khalatova A.G. Rasulova F. Dauter Z. Maurizi M.R. Rotanova T.V. Wlodawer A. Gustchina A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2002; 277: 9512-9519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The structures of signal peptidases suggest that the hydrophobic environment surrounding the catalytic Lys ϵ-amino group is likely essential for lowering its pKa so that it can reside in the deprotonated state required for its role as a general base (28Paetzel M. Dalbey R.E. Strynadka N.C. Nature. 1998; 396: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 29Paetzel M. Strynadka N.C. Tschantz W.R. Casareno R. Bullinger P.R. Dalbey R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9994-10003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It is supposed from the structural comparison that Lys-722 in Ec-Lon is not charged and acts as a general base as there is no acidic residue in the vicinity of the catalytic Lys and the side chain Oγ of the conserved Thr might be within hydrogen-bonding distance of the catalytic Lys in the wild-type enzyme (14Botos I. Melnikov E.E. Cherry S. Tropea J.E. Khalatova A.G. Rasulova F. Dauter Z. Maurizi M.R. Rotanova T.V. Wlodawer A. Gustchina A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 8140-8148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). It appears that the Ser-Lys dyad mechanism requires a third residue (Thr/Ser Oγ) for optimal activity, possibly serving to help align the general base Lys with the nucleophilic Ser hydroxyl via a hydrogen-bonding network. The role of such a Thr (Thr-704 in Ec-Lon) might be similar to the Asp present in the classic catalytic triad of serine proteases (30Dodson G. Wlodawer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 347-352Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). The same mechanism is not applicable to the Ser-Lys-Asp triad of Mj-Lon because the chemical properties of the Lys-Asp pair are quite different from those of a deprotonated Lys. In the environment of the active site of Mj-Lon, Lys-593 forms a salt bridge with Asp-547 and, presumably, is therefore positively charged. Moreover, unlike Ec-Lon, the conserved Thr-575 is not hydrogen-bonded to Lys-593 but to a water molecule (Wat1). Consequently, Lys-593 is unsuitable to function as a proton acceptor to abstract a proton from Ser-550. It is expected that the role of Lys-593 is to lower the pKa of the hydroxyl group of Ser-550 via its electrostatic potential so that the Oγ of Ser-550 can act as a nucleophile during proteolysis, as is seen in the structures of 20 S proteasomes (31Groll M. Huber R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 606-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The most probable proton acceptor is Wat1, which is located in the cavity and hydrogen-bonds with Ser-550. Wat1 is ideally positioned to act as the general base and promote the abstraction of a proton from the Ser-550 hydroxyl group, initiating nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of the peptide bond. The oxygen atom of Wat1 points directly at the hydroxyl of Ser-550 as if ready to deprotonate it, whereas the two hydrogen atoms of Wat1 are firmly hydrogen-bonded to the carbonyl oxygen of Leu-465 and hydroxyl group of Thr-575, as is shown in the 2Fo - Fc electron density map (Fig. 4A, 4B). Coordination of Wat1 by carbonyl and hydroxyl oxygens suggests that it might act as a proton acceptor in the initial polarization of Ser-550 during catalysis. The presence of an additional carbonyl oxygen of Ser-550 near Wat1 may stabilize the protonated water molecule. The conserved Thr residue (Thr-575 in Mj-Lon), which assists the catalytic dyad in Ec-Lon by hydrogen bonding with the deprotonated Lys, hydrogen-bonds instead with Wat1 in Mj-Lon, implying that its function differs from that in Ec-Lon. An important component of the catalytic machinery in serine proteases is the oxyanion hole that works by neutralizing the developing negative charge on the scissile carbonyl oxygen during the formation of the tetrahedral intermediates. Typical oxyanion holes are formed by two main-chain amide hydrogens that serve as hydrogen bond donors to the developing oxyanion (32Menard R. Storer A.C. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1992; 373: 393-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The oxyanion hole in Mj-Lon is formed by two main chain amide hydrogens, one originating from the catalytic Ser-550 and the other from the preceding residue, Asp-549. Despite the similar geometries of Ser and Lys residues and the similarity of the oxyanion holes in signal peptidases and the proteolytic domain of Mj-Lon, it is conceivable that Mj-Lon does not employ a Ser-Lys dyad because the hydrogen-bonding environment for the catalytic Lys is quite different. Instead, a structural comparison suggests that the mechanism of Mj-Lon protease is comparable with the autolytic mechanism of prosequences in the 20 S proteasomes, which belong to the N-terminal threonine protease family. In 20 S proteasomes, a conserved Lys charged by the salt bridge with a nearby Asp lowers the pKa of the Thr-1 Oγ via its electrostatic potential, and a base close to Thr-1 plays a role in the proton transfer (33Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1944) Google Scholar). Because the N-terminal amino group is not available to serve as a proton acceptor before activation of the protease through cleavage of the prosequence, a water molecule close to Thr-1 Oγ presumably serves as the proton acceptor in the initial autolysis step (31Groll M. Huber R. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2003; 35: 606-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Although the folds of the 20 S proteasome and Mj-Lon proteolytic domains are completely different overall, the presence of equivalent catalytic residues (Ser, Lys, and Asp) suggests that they share a similar proteolytic mechanism. However, the exact catalytic mechanism of Mj-Lon cannot be deduced from its structure. Further biochemical and structural analysis will be needed to reveal the precise mechanism. Classification of Proteolytic Domains of Lon Proteases—A search using the proteolytic domain of Mj-Lon against the Swiss-Prot data base with the BLAST algorithm identified over 100 different Lon proteases from 90 different organisms. Ex-tensive sequence alignment of homologous proteins showed that the segment containing the catalytic residues (residues extending from helix α2 to α3, residues 545-596 in M. jannaschii) are well conserved among all Lon protease families; moreover, the catalytic residues, Ser-550 and Lys-593 in M. jannaschii, are strictly conserved, without exception. On the other hand, the residues preceding the catalytic Ser are clearly divided into two groups: Asp (Asp-549 in M. jannaschii) preceded by α-helix-forming residues and Pro (Pro-678 in E. coli) preceded by β-strand-forming residues (Fig. 2B). A third putative residue in the active site of Mj-Lon, Asp-547, is also well conserved at the sequence level as either an Asp or a Glu among all proteases but has a different structural configuration for each group of proteases as described earlier. Thus, the shape of the active site pocket will significantly differ, depending on whether a Pro or an Asp precedes the catalytic Ser. Consequently, the protease domains of Lon can be classified into two groups with consensus sequences of DGPSA or (D/E)GDSA in the active site, which are represented by the proteolytic domains of Ec- and Mj-Lon in the present study. Hereafter, these two types of Lon proteases will be referred as type I and type II proteases, respectively. Comparison of the structures of the Mj- and Ec-Lon proteolytic domains revealed that these enzymes likely have different catalytic mechanisms, although they share the same overall fold and conserved dyad residues (Ser-550 and Lys-593). The difference in the shapes of active sites also implies that the substrate specificity and the catalytic activity of these proteases differ. Most type II Lon proteases are archaeal, but some have been identified in eubacteria (e.g. E. coli and Haemophilus ducreyi). Some microorganisms (e.g. E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) express both Lon types. Lon homologues located in a second open reading frame found in various bacteria have been designated LonB and are not necessarily type II Lon proteases. It is clear that LonA (e.g. Ec-Lon and Mj-Lon) and LonB are distinct as the latter contains an active site region (the catalytic Ser residue) but not an ATP-binding site (34Ward D.E. Shockley K.R. Chang L.S. Levy R.D. Michel J.K. Conners S.B. Kelly R.M. Archaea. 2002; 1: 63-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The presence of different types of Lon homologues within a cell suggests that they have distinct metabolic functions and substate specificities. Type II Lon is not found in eukaryotes (e.g. yeast, mouse, human, and other higher organisms), implying that dyad proteases are selected evolutionarily for eukaryotic cellular function.

https://openalex.org/W2035438082,"The UvrB protein is the central recognition protein in bacterial nucleotide excision repair. We have shown previously that the highly conserved β-hairpin motif in Bacillus caldotenax UvrB is essential for DNA binding, damage recognition, and UvrC-mediated incision, as deletion of the upper part of the β-hairpin (residues 97-112) results in the inability of UvrB to be loaded onto damaged DNA, defective incision, and the lack of strand-destabilizing activity. In this work, we have further examined the role of the β-hairpin motif of UvrB by a mutational analysis of 13 amino acids within or in the vicinity of the β-hairpin. These amino acids are predicted to be important for the interaction of UvrB with both damaged and non-damaged DNA strands as well as the formation of salt bridges between the β-hairpin and domain 1b of UvrB. The resulting mutants were characterized by standard functional assays such as oligonucleotide incision, electrophoretic mobility shift, strand-destabilizing, and ATPase assays. Our data indicated a direct role of Tyr96, Glu99, and Arg123 in damage-specific DNA binding. In addition, Tyr93 plays an important but less essential role in DNA binding by UvrB. Finally, the formation of salt bridges between the β-hairpin and domain 1b, involving amino acids Lys111 bound to Glu307 and Glu99 bound to Arg367 or Arg289, are important but not essential for the function of UvrB.

Nucleotide excision repair (NER) 1The abbreviations used are: NER, nucleotide excision repair; ds, double-stranded; ΔβH, delta β hairpin (UvrB lacking amino acids 97-112); WT, wild type; PIC, preincision complex. is a universal and highly conserved DNA repair pathway found in bacteria and eukaryotic cells. NER is unique because of its broad substrate specificity indicating that the chemical nature of the damage is not solely responsible for damage recognition. Rather a local change in the conformation of the DNA itself resulting from the damage may be required. Damage recognition during NER in bacteria is a multistep process accomplished by the UvrA and UvrB proteins. Recently solved crystal structures of the thermophilic UvrB proteins (1Machius M. Henry L.

The β-hairpin motif of UvrB, which extrudes from domain 1a and contacts domain 1b, is highly conserved in all bacterial species and absolutely required in the process of damage recognition during NER (4Skorvaga M.

In our padlock binding model for the UvrB·DNA preincision complex, we have proposed that the β-hairpin is inserted between the two DNA strands, and the non-damaged strand is locked between the β-hairpin and domain 1b (3Theis K.

It is believed that the β-hairpin is held in place with respect to domain 1b by two salt bridges and hydrophobic interactions at both the base and the tip of the hairpin (4Skorvaga M. Theis K.

The role of the β-hairpin in the damage recognition process has been studied by generating the β-hairpin deletion and several point mutants and analyzing them using functional assays. We have shown that the β-hairpin deletion mutant (Δβh) of UvrB still binds to UvrA, forms the UvrAB·DNA complex, and has significantly higher ATPase activity compared with WT UvrB. However, the Δβh mutant does not have any strand-separating activity, is not loaded onto the site of the damage, and consequently, does not support incision (4Skorvaga M. Theis K. Mandavilli B.S.

EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6140-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) have probed the role of hydrophobic residues in the β-hairpin of E. coli UvrB through a series of double mutants to show that (a) Tyr92/Tyr93 function in damage recognition by preventing UvrB binding to non-damaged sites, (b) Tyr95/Tyr96 at the base of β-hairpin have a direct role in damage recognition and are positioned in the vicinity of the lesion in the UvrB·DNA complex, and (c) Tyr101 and Phe108 in the tip of β-hairpin are important for the strand-separating activity of UvrB. More recently, Zou and co-workers (6Zou Y. Ma H. Minko I.G. Shell S.M. Yang Z. Qu Y. Xu Y. Geacintov N.E. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4196-4205Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) have also demonstrated an important role of Tyr95 in damage recognition. In this work, we further examined the role of amino acid residues in UvrB, which we predicted to be important in the process of damage recognition, namely in the interaction of UvrB with both the damaged and non-damaged DNA strands, and in the formation of salt bridges between the β-hairpin and domain 1b. Enzymes—UvrA and UvrB proteins from Bacillus caldotenax and UvrC protein from Thermotoga maritima were purified by standard procedures (NEB IMPACT™ T7 system manual) (4Skorvaga M. Theis K.

Pfu-Ultra DNA polymerase was purchased from Stratagene. Construction of Mutant UvrB—The construction of single amino acid substitution mutants of UvrB was performed by PCR (QuikChange™ Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit, Stratagene) using pUC18uvrBBca as the template DNA, sense and antisense mutagenic oligonucleotides specific for each mutant as PCR primers, and Pfu-Ultra DNA polymerase. The entire fragment amplified by PCR was sequenced to ensure that only the desired amino acid change occurred and no additional mutations had been introduced. The product was subsequently recloned into the pTYB1 vector (NEB). The positions of the mutated amino acids are highlighted on the crystal structure of B. caldotenax UvrB, see Fig. 1. DNA Substrates—Sigma Genosys synthesized the fluorescein-containing DNA substrates. The DNA sequence of a 50-bp dsDNA substrate containing a single internal fluorescein adduct (F26-50 dsDNA) is shown in Fig. 2A. The cholesterol-containing 50-base oligonucleotide was a generous gift from Nora Goosen (University of Leiden, the Netherlands) and was prepared as described in Ref. 4Skorvaga M. Theis K.

The DNA sequence of the helicase substrate (M13F26-M13mp19) is shown in Fig. 2B. Five pmol of a 26-mer containing an internal fluorescein adduct (M13F26) were labeled at the 5′ terminus under the same conditions as the F26-50 top strand. The helicase substrate was constructed by hybridizing 0.4 pmol of 5′-labeled M13F26 oligonucleotide with equimolar amounts of M13mp19(+) strand (Invitrogen). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Binding reactions were performed with 2 nm DNA substrate (5′-[32P] labeled F26-50 dsDNA) with 20 nmB. caldotenax UvrA and 60 nmB. caldotenax UvrB in 20 μl of UvrABC buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm ATP, 5 mm dithiothreitol) for 20 min at 55 °C. Glycerol was then added to the reaction (8% v/v), and the reaction mixture was loaded onto a 4% native polyacrylamide gel (80:1). Both the gel and the Tris borate EDTA (TBE) running buffer (89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 2.5 mm EDTA) contained 1 mm ATP and 10 mm MgCl2. Electrophoresis was performed for 3 h at 100 V at room temperature. The gel was dried and exposed to a Storage Phosphor Screen (Molecular Dynamics) overnight at room temperature. UvrABC Incision and Oligonucleotide-releasing Assay—These assays were performed as described previously (4Skorvaga M. Theis K. Mandavilli B.S. Kisker C. Van Houten B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1553-1559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). ATP Hydrolysis Assay—This assay was done as described previously (7Truglio J.J. Croteau D.L. Skorvaga M. DellaVecchia M.J. Theis K. Mandavilli B.S. Van Houten B. Kisker C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2498-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), with minor modifications. ATP (1 mm) was added to the reaction to initiate the assay. Incision of the Fluorescein- or Cholesterol-containing 50-mer dsDNA Substrate—We have shown previously that the β-hairpin motif in UvrB is essential for UvrC-mediated incisions (4Skorvaga M. Theis K. Mandavilli B.S. Kisker C. Van Houten B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1553-1559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In this study, we delved further into the role of the β-hairpin by analyzing 13 mutations strategically incorporated in and around this region of UvrB. We first investigated the effect of the individual UvrB mutations on the incision efficiencies of two defined DNA substrates, namely the fluorescein-(F26-50) and cholesterol-(Ch2650) containing 50-mer dsDNA with radioactively labeled 5′ termini. The results are shown in Fig. 3, A and B, respectively. Incision efficiencies are expressed relative to WT UvrABC and are summarized in Fig. 3C. Based on the results of the oligonucleotide incision assay, we divided the mutants into three categories according to the severity of their phenotype (i.e. ability to affect UvrC-mediated incision of a damaged DNA substrate). Category I mutants are defined as those that exhibit the most severe phenotype-failure to support UvrC-mediated incision of either substrate tested. UvrB mutants Y96A, E99A, and R123A fall into this category (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 5, 9, and 6, respectively). Amino acid Tyr96 is 100% conserved among all known UvrB proteins. According to our model, it is located at the base of the β-hairpin facing the damaged DNA strand and is the last amino acid residue of our β-hairpin deletion mutant (Δβh UvrB-deletion of residues 97-112) that did not support incision of the F26-50 dsDNA substrate. Both Glu99 and Arg123 are also 100% conserved. Glu99 is located on the side of β-hairpin where it forms contacts with the domain 1b (Arg123 is not involved in contacts to domain 1b.) The WT UvrB structure indicated the formation of a salt bridge between Glu99 and Arg367, thus bridging the β-hairpin to domain 1b. Surprisingly, the R367A mutation had a moderate effect on incision efficiency (Fig. 3, A and B, lane 13), suggesting that Glu99 might have an additional function such as the interaction with the DNA substrate rather than just the formation of a salt bridge with Arg367. Arg123, which is still present in our Δβh mutant, is located at the very base of the β-hairpin and seems to have an essential role in the interaction of UvrB with the DNA in the UvrB·DNA preincision complex, as an alanine substitution results in extremely low, if any, incision of either site-specific substrate (Fig. 3, A and B, lane 6). Category II mutants are those with a relatively mild phenotype, reaching only ∼ 50-80% of wild-type UvrABC endonuclease activity. This reduced activity was observed for the following mutations: Y92A, Y93A, R289A/R367A, R367A, E307A, and F527A (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 3, 4, and 12-15, respectively). Category III mutants do not exhibit a phenotype that differs from WT UvrB. Mutants K111A, H124A, F249A, and R289A had no effect on incision efficiency (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 10, 7, 8, and 11, respectively). The WT UvrB model had shown that Lys111 forms a salt bridge with Glu307. We also hypothesized that His124 and Phe249 might be involved in DNA binding. Loading of UvrB Mutants onto the Site of the Lesion—The ability of UvrB to efficiently recognize DNA damage and present it to the UvrC subunit is critically important in the overall reaction mechanism for the UvrABC system. To test whether these mutant UvrB proteins are loaded onto the site of the damage, i.e. whether they form a stable UvrB·DNA preincision complex, we used the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The results are shown in Fig. 4. We used a cholesterol-containing 50-mer dsDNA labeled with 32P at the 5′-end of the damaged strand as the DNA substrate. The results of the electrophoretic mobility shift assay correlate well with the incision data obtained for mutants in category I. Those that failed to promote an incision of the defined substrates, such as mutants Y96A, R123A, and E99A, did not form a stable UvrB·DNA PIC (Fig. 4, lanes 5, 6, and 9, respectively). Although many of the category II mutants displayed near WT levels of UvrB·DNA complex formation, a few showed remarkable diversity in the quantity of a stable UvrB·DNA complex. This is especially evident when comparing mutants Y92A and Y93A (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4, respectively). The Y92A mutant reaches UvrB·DNA complex formation levels close to WT UvrB, whereas Y93A is significantly lower. It is interesting to note that despite the difference in UvrB·DNA complex formation, the incision activities of these two mutants do not differ as greatly (82 and 68% relative to wild-type UvrB, respectively). Furthermore, although the F527A mutant is slightly deficient in incision, it appears to be loaded onto damaged DNA better than WT. All category III mutants (no phenotype in incision assay), i.e. K111A, H124A, and F249A, are proficient in UvrB·DNA complex formation. Each promotes the formation of the UvrB·DNA complex as well as WT UvrB (Fig. 4, lanes 10, 7, and 8, respectively). Strand-destabilizing Activity of UvrB Mutants—A limited strand opening around the lesion by the UvrAB complex has previously been shown to be important for dynamic recognition of damaged DNA (8Gordienko I. Rupp W.D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 889-895Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 9Zou Y. Van Houten B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4889-4901Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of mutations in UvrB on this limited helix-destabilizing activity of the UvrAB complex, we evaluated these mutants in the strand-destabilizing assay (4Skorvaga M. Theis K. Mandavilli B.S. Kisker C. Van Houten B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1553-1559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This assay measures the release of a radioactively labeled 26-mer oligonucleotide containing a site-specific fluorescein from M13mp19(+) single-stranded circular DNA. These results are shown in Fig. 5A, and the quantitation is summarized in Fig. 5B. Category I mutants Y96A, R123A, and E99A exhibit defects in strand-destabilizing activity (Fig. 5A, lanes 8, 10, and 16, respectively) similar to those seen with the Δβh UvrB mutant (4Skorvaga M. Theis K. Mandavilli B.S. Kisker C. Van Houten B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1553-1559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Among the category II mutants, it is interesting that mutant Y93A, which showed only a mild reduction in incision efficiency and a very significant decrease in UvrB·DNA complex formation, also exhibited a significant loss of strand-destabilizing activity compared with WT UvrB (Fig. 5A, lane 2 versus 6). In addition, mutants R289A/R367A and E307A (Fig. 5A, lanes 24 and 20, respectively) exhibited a more detrimental effect on the strand-destabilizing activity of UvrB than observed for either UvrB·DNA complex formation or incision. Again it is interesting to note that F527A displays 100% of WT activity in this assay (Fig. 5A, lane 28). The category III mutants, H124A, F249A, and K111A show strand-destabilizing activity comparable with that of WT UvrB (Fig. 5A, lanes 12, 14, and 18, respectively. versus lane 2). ATPase Activity of Selected UvrB Mutants—It has been shown previously that ATP binding and hydrolysis are absolutely required for NER (10Oh E.Y. Grossman L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 3638-3642Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 11Moolenaar G.F. Herron M.F. Monaco V. van der Marel G.A. van Boom J.H. Visse R. Goosen N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8044-8050Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) However, the precise step(s) during damage processing that requires ATP binding and or hydrolysis remains unclear. The situation is further complicated by the fact that UvrA possesses two ABC ATPase domains, is an ATPase, and UvrB has cryptic ATPase activity, which is activated in the presence of UvrA and damaged DNA. We have proposed that the free energy available either from ATP hydrolysis or UvrA·UvrB complex formation might be crucial for a conformational change in UvrB prior to the binding of DNA (4Skorvaga M. Theis K. Mandavilli B.S. Kisker C. Van Houten B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1553-1559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 12Theis K. Skorvaga M. Machius M. Nakagawa N. Van Houten B. Kisker C. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 277-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). According to our padlock model, a conformational change of the β-hairpin transforms UvrB from a relatively poor DNA-binding protein into a highly specific damaged DNA-binding/recognition protein. To test whether the altered DNA binding properties of selected mutants are because of an altered ATPase activity, we examined their ATPase activity in the presence or absence of UV light-irradiated DNA alone (Fig. 6A) or in combination with UvrA (Fig. 6B). These data suggest that the ATPase activity of UvrB and the incision activity are not well correlated as seen also in the β-hairpin deletion mutant (4Skorvaga M. Theis K. Mandavilli B.S. Kisker C. Van Houten B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1553-1559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), which displayed no incision activity but elevated ATPase activity (4Skorvaga M. Theis K. Mandavilli B.S. Kisker C. Van Houten B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 1553-1559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 7Truglio J.J. Croteau D.L. Skorvaga M. DellaVecchia M.J. Theis K. Mandavilli B.S. Van Houten B. Kisker C. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2498-2509Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Y96A showed a similar phenotype with very little incision activity but almost full ATPase activity (Fig. 6B). The other category I mutants, R123A and E99A, showed 43 and 72% of the WT UvrB ATPase activity in the presence of UvrA and damaged DNA. For the category II mutations, Y92A displayed 20% more activity than WT UvrB, whereas the other mutants in this category showed a 20-50% reduction in UvrA/DNA damage-stimulated ATPase activity. The category III mutants, H124A, F249A, and K111A, had variable ATPase activities ranging from 46% (K111A) to 92% (H124A) of the WT UvrB activity. The aim of this work was to identify residues within and adjacent to the β-hairpin that might be directly involved in binding the damaged and non-damaged DNA strands during NER. We also tested the importance of the salt bridges that are formed between the β-hairpin motif and domain 1b; Glu99 forms a salt bridge to Arg367 or Arg289, and Lys111 forms the second salt bridge to Glu307 (Fig. 1) as seen in the WT UvrB structure (3Theis K. Chen P.J. Skorvaga M. Van Houten B. Kisker C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6899-6907Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The first group of residues we studied were the highly conserved tyrosines at positions 92, 93, and 96. Tyr96 is absolutely conserved among bacterial UvrB species, and the Y96A UvrB mutant displayed a defect in incision, failed to form a stable UvrB·DNA preincision complex, and had a very low level of strand-destabilizing activity. These data strongly support the results obtained for the Y95A/Y96A double mutant reported previously (5Moolenaar G.F. Hoglund L. Goosen N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6140-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Together, the data lead to the conclusion that Tyr96 plays a direct role in damage-specific DNA binding by UvrB. Furthermore, Zou and co-workers (6Zou Y. Ma H. Minko I.G. Shell S.M. Yang Z. Qu Y. Xu Y. Geacintov N.E. Lloyd R.S. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 4196-4205Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) prepared the Y95W mutant of UvrB and showed that it retained full activity, suggesting a less important role for Y95. Moolenaar et al. (5Moolenaar G.F. Hoglund L. Goosen N. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6140-6149Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) suggested two mechanisms whereby UvrB might accomplish its task of damage recognition. First, they suggested that a clash between a non-damaged nucleotide and Tyr92 and/or Tyr93 prevents the binding of UvrB to a non-damaged DNA site. Secondly, they proposed that the damaged nucleotide would be flipped out of the DNA helix, allowing Tyr92 and/or Tyr93 to occupy the vacated space. Our data suggest that the Tyr92 and Tyr93 might be functionally redundant and that the presence of one is sufficient for proper damage-dependent activity, in which case Tyr92 or Tyr93 could slip into the vacated base position. However, from the phenotype of the single mutants it is clear that Tyr93 has a more important role in DNA recognition than Tyr92, because the Y93A mutant is reproducibly more impaired in all the functional assays as compared with the Y92A mutant. Two amino acid residues at the base of β-hairpin, Arg123 and His124, and one amino acid located on domain 2, Phe249, were mutated as well. All of these residues are on the side of UvrB that is proposed to interact with the non-damaged DNA strand. The R123A mutant exhibited a very severe defect in incision, preincision complex formation, and strand-destabilizing activity (category I). This would suggest that Arg123 is absolutely required for UvrB DNA binding and that it either directly contacts the DNA or promotes structural changes that stabilize DNA binding. On the other hand, the H124A and F249A mutants exhibit WT-like phenotypes. Mutants suspected to disrupt salt bridge formation exhibited phenotypes ranging from severe to no effect. However, the majority of salt bridge mutants examined in this study display a mild phenotype. These mutated amino acid residues, R367A, R289A/R367A, and E307A, are all located on domain 1b opposite the β-hairpin. Alternatively, salt bridge mutations localized within the β-hairpin belong to the other two categories. For example, the β-hairpin mutant E99A had the most severe phenotype as it was shown to be defective in all functional assays (incision, loading onto the site of the damage, strand-destabilizing activity). Although Glu99 is thought to be essential for proper UvrB function, mutations of its proposed salt bridge partners, Arg367 or Arg289 to alanines, showed only a mild phenotype. This suggests that the salt bridge between Glu99 and Arg367 (or Arg289) may not be as important as we predicted, or Glu99 may form an alternative salt bridge or serve a different purpose altogether. The formation of salt bridges between the β-hairpin and domain 1b, between amino acids Lys111 and Glu307 and between Glu99 and Arg367 (or Arg289), might be redundant such that the crippling of one can be offset by the activity of the others. It is also possible that Glu99 might play another role in damage processing other than formation of a salt bridge. The final mutant evaluated was Phe527, located in domain 3 (close to domain 1a). We chose to mutate this residue because of its high degree of conservation with monomeric helicases (13Dillingham M.S. Soultanas P. Wiley P. Webb M.R. Wigley D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8381-8387Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) and its potential to intercalate between the DNA bases. The homologous amino acid in PcrA, Phe626, has been shown to intercalate into DNA and is proposed to be involved in binding and releasing DNA bases in response to ATP hydrolysis (13Dillingham M.S. Soultanas P. Wiley P. Webb M.R. Wigley D.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 8381-8387Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that Phe527 of UvrB might be involved in coupling domain 3 motions with the movement of DNA across the DNA binding surface of UvrB to properly align the DNA damage with the damage recognition elements of UvrB, i.e. Tyr96. We discovered that the F527A protein is more proficient than WT UvrB at generating stable UvrB·DNA complexes yet possesses reduced incision activity; therefore we propose that it is defective in the presentation of DNA to UvrC. A hypothetical model for the roles of Tyr92, Tyr93, Tyr95, Tyr96, Glu99, Arg123, and Phe527 in UvrB-mediated DNA damage processing is shown in Fig. 7. UvrB is believed to first lock the non-damaged strand (14DellaVecchia M.J. Croteau D.L. Skorvaga M. Dezhurov S.V. Lavrik O.I. Van Houten B. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 45245-45256Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) into place by the interactions between the β-hairpin and domain 1b (see Fig. 1). Following this initial step, UvrB grasps the damaged strand by making intimate contacts between the adducted base and Tyr95 and Tyr96 (Fig. 7A). Once the damaged strand has been fully engaged, it is believed that UvrB uses its helicase fold to close domain 3 down on the damaged strand, possibly through ATP binding. This domain motion uses Phe527, and most likely another yet to be identified amino acid, to force the damaged strand up into the 3′-nuclease active center so that UvrC can cleave the phosphodiester backbone (Fig. 7B). Once incision has occurred, UvrB hydrolyzes ATP to return domain 3 to its original position. This model explains why the β-hairpin deletion mutant hydrolyzes more ATP as compared with the WT UvrB (4Skorvaga M. Theis K. Mandavilli B.S. Kisker C. Van Houten B. J. Biol.

Each round of ATP binding mediates domain 3 closure and is met with DNA strand slippage away from the deleted β-hairpin, which still maintains the aromatic bases at the stump but loses its ability to lock down the non-damaged strand.

WSC1, RHO2, ROM2, GFA1, and CDC5 genes were isolated as multicopy suppressors of gpi7-2 mutant. Multicopy suppressors could suppress the growth defect of gpi7 mutants but not the cell separation defect. Loss of function mutations of genes involved in the Cbk1p-Ace2p pathway, which activates the expression of daughter-specific genes for cell separation after cytokinesis, bypassed the temperature-sensitive growth defect of gpi7 mutants. Furthermore, deletion of EGT2, one of the genes controlled by Ace2p and encoding a GPI-anchored protein required for cell separation, ameliorated the temperature sensitivity of the gpi7 mutant. In this mutant, Egt2p was displaced from the septal region to the cell cortex, indicating that GPI7 plays an important role in cell separation via the GPI-based modification of daughter-specific proteins in S. cerevisiae.

Phosphatidylinositol is modified by the stepwise addition of sugars and ethanolaminephosphate (EtN-P), thus forming a complete precursor lipid in the ER. GPI transamidase complex recognizes a carboxyl-terminal signal in substrate proteins, cleaves a carboxyl-terminal peptide from the proprotein substrate, and attaches a GPI moiety to the nascent carboxyl terminus, referred to as the ω-site (4Kinoshita T. Inoue N. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). GPI7/LAS21, a gene involved in the GPI biosynthetic pathway, is required for the addition of a side chain EtN-P to the second mannose portion of the GPI core glycan structure (5Benachour A. Sipos G. Flury I. Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Vionnet C. Conzelmann A. Benghezal M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15251-15261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). GPI7 is not essential for cell viability, and GPI lacking a side chain EtN-P due to the loss of GPI7 function is still transferred to proteins (4Kinoshita T. Inoue N. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 5Benachour A. Sipos G. Flury I. Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Vionnet C. Conzelmann A. Benghezal M. J. Biol.

Deletion of GPI7 causes a growth defect at high temperature, hypersensitivity to calcofluor white, and a decreased replacement of primary lipid moiety of GPI anchors by ceramide (5Benachour A. Sipos G. Flury I. Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Vionnet C. Conzelmann A. Benghezal M. J. Biol.

Mutations in GPI7 also affect cell wall anchorage in S. cerevisiae and Candida albicans (9Richard M. de Groot P. Courtin O. Poulain D. Klis F. Gaillardin C. Microbiology. 2002; 148: 2125-2133Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). GPI7 is involved in chlamydospore formation, budding patterns, and cell shape in C. albicans (10Richard M. Ibata-Ombetta S. Dromer F. Bordon-Pallier F. Jouault T. Gaillardin C. Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 44: 841-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) and invasive growth in the dimorphic yeast Yarrowia lipolytica (11Richard M. Quijano R.R. Bezzate S. Bordon-Pallier F. Gaillardin C. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3098-3107Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, how GPI7 is involved in these phenomena is still unknown.Cell separation is the last step of the cell division cycle in budding yeast. It is completed by the degradation of the septum, a specialized structure of the cell wall (12Cabib E. Roh D.H. Schmidt M. Crotti L.B. Varma A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19679-19682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). A chitinase and some glucanases, which are expressed only in daughter cells, are transported to the bud neck and degrade the septum (12Cabib E. Roh D.H. Schmidt M. Crotti L.B. Varma A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19679-19682Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 13Baladron V. Ufano S. Duenas E. Martin-Cuadrado A.B. del Rey F. Vazquez de Aldana C.R. Eukaryot.

Luca F.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3782-3803Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). In this report, we provide several lines of evidence that GPI biosynthesis, especially the addition of EtN-P to the glycan portion of the GPI anchor by Gpi7p, is involved in the control of cell separation via modification of daughter-specific cell wall assembly proteins. Furthermore we propose a novel hypothesis that EtN-P of the GPI anchor is important for the correct targeting of the GPI-anchored proteins in yeast cell separation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESStrains, Media, and Plasmids—Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. YPAD and synthetic complete (SC) media were used as described previously (16Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). SDCA contains 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids (Difco), 2% glucose, 0.5% casamino acids, and 0.004% adenine sulfate. The disruption of genes in yeast was performed with a one-step gene disruption method as described previously (17Longtine M.S. McKenzie A. II I Demarini D.J. Shah N.G. Wach A. Brachat A. Philippsen P. Pringle J.R. Yeast. 1998; 14: 953-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (4105) Google Scholar). All the primer sets used for the gene disruption are listed in Table II. Three tandem copies of the HA epitope were placed just before the stop codon of GPI7 as follows. TOp1014, which carried the GPI7 gene in YCUp4 (CEN4, ARS1, URA3), was kindly provided by Dr. Akio Toh-e (University of Tokyo). Using TOp1014 as a template, an NheI restriction site was introduced by PCR just before the stop codon of GPI7, and the PCR product was subcloned into the centromere plasmid pRS316 (18Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate pMF3 and sequenced for confirmation. The NheI-NheI cassette containing three copies of the HA epitope was prepared from pYT11 (19Takita Y. Ohya Y. Anraku Y. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1995; 246: 269-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) and inserted into the NheI site of pMF3 to generate pMF7 (pRS316-GPI7-HA). To create gpi7 point mutations, we used the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The centromere plasmid pRS315-HA-EGT2, in which 3xHA-tagged EGT2 is expressed under its own promoter, was constructed as follows. A DNA fragment containing the EGT2 open reading frame, a 0.7-kb upstream region, and a 0.5-kb downstream region was amplified by PCR and subcloned in pRS315 (18Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to generate pMF295. Using pMF295 as a template, the SmaI site was introduced 78 nucleotides downstream from the start codon of EGT2 by PCR. The PCR product was subcloned into pRS315 to generate pMF296 and sequenced for confirmation. The SmaI-SmaI cassette containing three copies of the HA epitope was inserted into the SmaI site of pMF296 to generate pMF297 (pRS315-HA-EGT2). The centromere plasmid pRS315-HA-ENG1, in which 3xHA-tagged ENG1 is expressed under its own promoter, was constructed as follows. A DNA fragment containing the ENG1 open reading frame, a 0.8-kb upstream region, and a 0.4-kb downstream region was amplified by PCR and subcloned in pRS315 to generate pMF306. Using pMF306 as a template, the SmaI site was introduced 600 nucleotides downstream from the start codon of ENG1 by PCR. The PCR product was subcloned into pRS315 to generate pMF309 and sequenced for confirmation. A SmaI-SmaI cassette containing three copies of the HA epitope was prepared and inserted into the SmaI site of pMF309 to generate pMF310 (pRS315-HA-ENG1). pRS315-HA-ENG1-EGT2, the 3xHA-tagged ENG1-EGT2 chimeric gene expressed under the ENG1 promoter, was constructed as follows. Using pMF310 as a template, a HindIII restriction site was introduced by PCR just before the stop codon of ENG1, and the PCR product was subcloned into the centromere plasmid pRS315 to generate pMF355 and sequenced for confirmation. Using pMF295 as a template, a HindIII site was introduced 150 nucleotides upstream and a XhoI site was introduced 0.5-kb downstream from the stop codon of EGT2 by PCR. The PCR product was subcloned into pMF355 to generate pMF357 (pRS315-HA-ENG1-EGT2) and sequenced for confirmation.Table IYeast strains in this studyStrainsPlasmidGenotypeOriginW303-1AMATa leu2 his3 trp1 ura3 ade2 can1Ref. 64Sutton A.

From about 15,000 transformants, 48 colonies that could grow at 35.7 °C on SC-Leu-Ura plates were obtained. These colonies were grown on SC-Leu plates containing 0.1% 5-fluoroorotic acid to remove pRS316-gpi7-2-HA at 30 °C. Then the multicopy plasmids recovered from these cells were introduced again into gpi7-2 cells. Of these colonies, seven could grow at 35.7 °C on SDCA. Restriction analysis or DNA sequencing was performed for the seven plasmids. We obtained two kinds of plasmids. One plasmid contained GPI7 itself. The others were derived from a locus different from each other. After subcloning, the suppressor genes in these plasmids were determined to be WSC1, RHO2, ROM2, GFA1, and CDC5.To screen for extragenic suppressors of gpi7Δ, a yeast genomic library mutagenized by an mTn-3xHA/GFP transposon kindly provided by Dr. Michael Snyder (Yale University) was used to transform MFY11 (gpi7Δ). A total of ∼33,000 transformants was obtained on SC–Ura plates. The colonies were replica-plated on SC–Ura plates and cultured at 35.7 °C to select mutants. The colonies that could survive at 35.7 °C were streaked again on SC–Ura plates and cultured at 35.7 °C to confirm the recovery of temperature sensitivity. Tagged transposon sites were identified by direct genomic sequencing as described previously (20Horecka J. Jigami Y. Yeast. 2000; 16: 967-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar).myo-[2-3H]Inositol Labeling of GPI Intermediates—GPI intermediates were labeled with myo-[2-3H]inositol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) as described previously with some modifications (21Benghezal M. Lipke P.N. Conzelmann A. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1333-1344Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in SDCA medium, and 2.5 × 107 cells were resuspended in 600 μl of synthetic dextrose inositol-free medium containing 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without inositol and amino acids (Bio101), 5% glucose, and nutrient supplements. Cells were divided into two tubes and preincubated for 20 min at 25 or 35.7 °C, and 0.25 MBq of myo-[2-3H]inositol was added. The cells were then incubated for 90 min at 25 or 35.7 °C, respectively. After the 90-min incubation, 10 mm (final concentration) NaF and NaN3 were added to the reaction mixture to stop the reaction. The cells were washed with water. Lipids were extracted and desalted by butanol extraction as described previously (22Sipos G. Puoti A. Conzelmann A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2789-2796Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The lipid extracts were analyzed by ascending TLC using 0.2-mm-thick silica gel plates with a solvent system of chloroform/methanol/water (10:10:3). Radioactivity was detected using Molecular Imager FX (Bio-Rad).Western Blotting—The samples were denatured with sample buffer for 1 h at 4 °C for membrane proteins and run on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described previously (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205998) Google Scholar). After SDS-PAGE, the proteins on the polyacrylamide gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Gpi7-HAp was detected with the anti-HA monoclonal antibody 16B12 (Babco). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by staining with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Cell Signaling Technology) and chemiluminescence with ECL-Plus (Amersham Biosciences).Flow Cytometry—Yeast cells grown on SC medium until 5 × 106–1 × 107 cells/ml with water bath shaker (Taitec) at a rate of 160 rpm were resuspended in 300 μlof0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), added to 700 μl of cold (–20 °C) ethanol, and stored at –20 °C. The cells were washed twice with 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and sonicated with minimum output for 10 s (Sonifier Cell Disruptor 350, Tomy). The cells were harvested and resuspended in RNase solution (1 mg/ml RNase A (Qiagen) in 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5)) at 30 °C for 3–4 h. The RNase-treated cells were harvested and resuspended in 100 μl of propidium iodide (PI) solution (0.1% sodium citrate, 0.058% NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 0.005% PI), put on ice for 15 min, and added to 400 μl of 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5). DNA contents were measured by FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). For cell synchronization, cells were arrested with α-factor (Peptide Institute, Inc.) for 3 h at 25 °C, washed, and transferred into prewarmed YPAD medium at 35.7 °C.Fluorescence Microscopy—All fluorescence images were observed using a fluorescence microscope, BX50 (Olympus). For calcofluor white staining, cells washed with water were sonicated for 10 s as described above, and calcofluor white solution (1 mg/ml calcofluor white (Sigma) in water) was added. The cells were then washed twice with water. For HA-Egt2p, HA-Eng1p, and HA-Eng1-Egt2p localization, cells grown in SC medium were sonicated, incubated at 35.7 °C for 4 h, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature, and stained as described previously with some modifications (24Abe H. Shimma Y. Jigami Y. Glycobiology. 2003; 13: 87-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Cells were washed with 250 μl of phosphate-buffered saline with bovine serum albumin (1 mg/ml) and rat anti-HA antibody 3F10 (Roche Applied Science) and incubated at 4 °C for 1 h. The cells were then washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in phosphate-buffered saline buffer with bovine serum albumin and Alexa 488-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG at 4 °C for 1 h.RESULTSIsolation and Characterization of gpi7-2 Mutants—To understand the cellular functions of GPI7, we adopted two different genetic approaches: a multicopy suppressor analysis with a gpi7 missense mutant and an extragenic suppressor analysis with a gpi7 gene-disrupted (gpi7Δ) mutant. Although several multicopy suppressors were isolated from gpi7Δ cells (7Toh-e A. Oguchi T. Genes Genet. Syst. 1998; 73: 365-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 8Toh-e A. Oguchi T. Genes Genet. Syst. 1999; 74: 241-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 25Toh-e A. Oguchi T. Genes Genet. Syst. 2002; 77: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), no significant information was obtained to elucidate the biological function of GPI7. Our purpose in this study was to obtain new suppressors from gpi7 missense and gpi7Δ mutant cells, which may help to elucidate the biological functions of Gpi7p. First, we tried to isolate missense mutants of GPI7 that show a deficiency in only a part of the several proposed functions of Gpi7p (5Benachour A. Sipos G. Flury I. Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E.

Syst. 2002; 77: 309-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) among site-directed mutagenic constructs. We replaced the positively or negatively charged amino acid(s) with alanine in a region that is conserved among the GPI7 open reading frames of S. cerevisiae (GenBank™ accession numbers in parentheses) (NP_012473), C. albicans (AAL83897), Y. lipolytica (AAK52677), Schizosaccharomyces pombe (CAA91096), Caenorhabditis elegans (NP_495820), and Homo sapiens (BAC11227). One mutant, gpi7-2, in which the 153rd and 154th aspartic acids are replaced by two alanines (Fig. 1A, shown as “AA”), showed temperature sensitivity at 35.7 °C (Fig. 1B). This mutational region was conserved among GPI13 orthologues (Fig. 1A) but not MCD4 orthologues (data not shown). Both Gpi13p and Gpi7p transfer EtN-P to position 6 of the mannose, whereas Mcd4p transfers it to position 2 (4Kinoshita T. Inoue N. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2000; 4: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Therefore, the mutation site in gpi7-2 is conserved in the EtN-P transferases, which transfer EtN-P to position 6 of the mannose. The mutant cells recovered their cell growth on addition of an osmotic stabilizer, 1 m sorbitol (Fig. 1C), and were hypersensitive to calcofluor white (Fig. 1D), indicating that the mutant cells are defective in cell wall biogenesis or assembly. Western blotting analysis of HA-tagged Gpi7p revealed that the mutant Gpi7-2 proteins were of the same size as Gpi7-HA fusion protein (90 kDa) and were not significantly degraded in the cells by the point mutation (Fig. 1E). Therefore, the temperature sensitivity of the gpi7-2 strain might be due to the loss of the Gpi7p enzymatic activity and not due to the degradation of mutant Gpi7 proteins. Next we examined whether this mutant accumulates the GPI intermediate Manα1,2-(EtN-P)Manα1,2-Manα1,6-(EtN-P)Manα1,4-GlcNα1,6-inositol-PO4-lipid (M4), which is specifically detected in gpi7Δ cells, at permissive and non-permissive temperatures (5Benachour A. Sipos G. Flury I. Reggiori F. Canivenc-Gansel E. Vionnet C. Conzelmann A. Benghezal M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15251-15261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The lipid fraction from gpi7-2 cells treated at the non-permissive temperature (35.7 °C) showed M4 accumulation, while the M4 accumulation was decreased at the permissive temperature (25 °C) (Fig. 1F). These results indicate that the gpi7-2 gene product partially functions in EtN-P transfer activity at the permissive temperature but loses its function at the non-permissive temperature. Therefore, we selected strain gpi7-2 for further characterization.We investigated the morphology of the gpi7 mutant cells. Interestingly gpi7 mutants showed an abnormal cell arrangement after 4-h incubation at the restrictive temperature (35.7 °C), while the morphology of the gpi7 cells was normal at permissive temperature (25 °C) (data not shown). Approximately 30% of the gpi7-2 cells showed a unique arrangement in which the mother cell is attached to two daughter cells even after sonication (Fig. 2B). This abnormal cell arrangement was still observed after 10-h incubation at 35.7 °C. Judging from methylene blue staining, most of the gpi7-2 cells were still viable after 10-h incubation at the non-permissive temperature (data not shown), suggesting that gpi7-2 cells might arrest at this stage. The DNA content of propidium iodide-stained cells was analyzed by flow cytometry (Fig. 2, A and B). An abnormal peak, 3C DNA content, was observed in gpi7-2 cells after 4-h incubation at 35.7 °C (Fig. 2B), while only the 1C and 2C DNA peaks were observed in wild-type cells. The 3C peak was also observed in gpi7Δ cells at the non-permissive temperature (data not shown). These 3C peaks tightly correlated to the abnormal cell arrangement observed in gpi7 mutants at the restrictive temperature (Fig. 2B). To confirm the three-cell arrangement observed in gpi7 mutant cells more precisely, we examined the DNA content and cell morphology during the cell cycle progression using G1 synchronous cultures treated with α-factor. The synchronized wild-type and gpi7-2 cells were released into YPAD medium at the non-permissive temperature, 35.7 °C. The α-factor-treated gpi7-2 cells were not completely uniform but showed 1C plus a few 2C peaks (Fig. 2E), whereas wild-type cells were uniformly 1C (Fig. 2C). Wild-type cells normally progressed through the cell cycle, regenerating G1 phase cells with 1C DNA content at about 90 min after the release (Fig. 2, C and D). In contrast, gpi7 mutant cells failed to regenerate a distinct 1C peak, and 3C DNA cells accumulated at about 180 min after the release (Fig. 2E). The observation of cell morphology revealed that most of the gpi7 mutant cells (more than 80% of total cells) showed a three-cell arrangement (Fig. 2F).Fig. 2The gpi7-2 mutant cells show a cell separation defect and accumulated three-cell arrangement.

The polymorphism is located in the first of 13 Ca2+-binding motifs, within a consensus sequence in which Asn-700 likely coordinates Ca2+.

The Ser-700 truncation constructs bound 1 fewer Ca2+ than matching Asn-700 constructs and exhibited decreased binding affinities. Intrinsic fluorescence of a tryptophan at residue 698 (Trp-698) in the most N-terminal motif was cooperatively quenched by the addition of Ca2+ to Asn-700 Tr2, Tr3, and Tr4 constructs. In Ser-700 constructs, quenching of Trp-698 was incomplete in the Tr2 and Tr3 constructs and complete only in the Tr4 construct. Ca2+-induced quenching of Ser-700 constructs required higher [Ca2+] and was slower as shown in stopped-flow experiments than quenching of Asn-700 constructs. Such differences were not found with Tb3+, which quenched the fluorescence of Asn-700 and Ser-700 constructs equivalently. Thus, the Ser-700 polymorphism alters a rapidly filled, high affinity Ca2+-binding site in the first Ca2+-binding motif. Slower Ca2+ binding to adjoining motifs partly compensates for the change.

TSP-1 belongs to the thrombospondin family of extracellular proteins that includes five vertebrate members (TSP-1–5), at least two chordate TSPs (5Adolph K.W. DNA Sequence. 2002; 13: 277-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), a Drosophila TSP (6Adolph K.W. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 269: 177-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 7Adams J.C.

Reprod. 2004; PubMed Google Scholar). A TSP-1 monomer contains an N-terminal module, an oligomerization sequence, a procollagen module, three properdin modules, three EGF-like modules, several Ca2+-binding repeats, and a lectin-like C-terminal globular domain (4Adams J.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2001; 17: 25-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar, 9Kvansakul M. Adams J.C. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The Ca2+-binding and C-terminal sequences are highly conserved among all TSP family members. Alignment of human TSP-1 and Drosophila TSP demonstrates exact spacing of 16 cysteines in the Ca2+-binding repeats. The disulfide bond pattern for the homologous region in TSP-2 has been found to be sequential (10Misenheimer T.M. Hahr A.J. Harms A.C. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45882-45887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), thereby separating the Ca2+-binding repeats into putative Ca2+-binding motifs (Fig. 1).The crystal structure of the most C-terminal six motifs and the C-globe of TSP-1 indicates that a 12-residue sequence coordinates Ca2+ via two novel Ca2+-binding motifs, an N-type and a C-type motif (9Kvansakul M. Adams J.C. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The N-type motif binds 1–2 Ca2+ using the 12-residue sequence, whereas the C-type motif binds 2 Ca2+, utilizing both the 12-residue sequence and the residues C-terminal to the 12-residue sequence (Fig. 1). The integrity of each Ca2+-binding sequence seems important to the structure and function of this region of TSPs since missense mutations in the Ca2+-binding region of TSP-5 (also known as cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, or COMP) cause two forms of skeletal dysplasias, pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) and multiple epiphyseal dysplasia 1 (EDM1) (11Briggs M.D. Hoffman S.M. King L.M. Olsen A.S. Mohrenweiser H. Leroy J.G. Mortier G.R. Rimoin D.L. Lachman R.S. Gaines E.S. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 330-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 12Hecht J.T. Nelson L.D.

Many of these mutations affect residues potentially important in coordinating Ca2+ to TSP-5. Studies of recombinant TSP-5 with PSACH or EDM1 mutations have shown that mutant proteins bind a decreased number of Ca2+ (13Thur J. Rosenberg K. Nitsche D.P. Pihlajamaa T. Ala-Kokko L. Heinegard D.

An aspartate or asparagine is found at the position of the polymorphic residue in all TSPs. The fluorescence of a nearby tryptophan at residue 698 (Trp-698), which occupies the seventh position in the putative motif, is cooperatively quenched upon the addition of Ca2+ (17Hannah B.L. Misenheimer T.M. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8929-8934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Ca2+-induced quenching of Trp-698 in recombinant constructs comprised of the third EGF-like module and the Ca2+-binding repeats (E3Ca) occurs with EC50 values of 70 and 110 μm for Asn-700 and Ser-700 protein, respectively (17Hannah B.L. Misenheimer T.M. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8929-8934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The results suggest that the Ser-700 polymorphism alters the Ca2+ sensitivity of the Ca2+-binding repeats, but it is not known whether the residues around the N700S polymorphism constitute a Ca2+-binding site. This region has been considered to be a linker sequence between the third EGF-like repeat and the Ca2+-binding repeats (9Kvansakul M. Adams J.C. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 18Lawler J. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 1635-1648Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). We noted that the linker can be modeled to be a C-type motif if one considers the 14 residues just C-terminal to residue 700 to be an insert (Fig. 1), and we hypothesized that the linker is the first of 13 (rather than 12) Ca2+-binding motifs. Three mutations in this part of TSP-5 are associated with PSACH or EDM1 (reviewed in Ref. 19Briggs M.D. Chapman K.L. Hum. Mutat. 2002; 19: 465-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar), also suggesting that the linker represents a Ca2+-binding motif. We further hypothesized that the presence of the Ser-700 polymorphism disrupts this site, but cooperative binding of Ca2+ to adjacent Ca2+-binding motifs also triggers the conformational change reported by Trp-698. To test these hypotheses, we quantified Ca2+ binding to the E3Ca proteins and truncation sets with an asparagine or serine at residue 700. Occupancy of binding sites was related to Ca2+-induced fluorescence quenching as assessed by equilibrium and stopped-flow fluorescence.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of Common and Polymorphic Truncation Constructs—To facilitate baculovirus-mediated protein expression and subsequent purification, we used the pAcGP67.coco transfer vector in which cloning sites are flanked by 5′ DNA encoding a signal sequence and 3′ DNA encoding a polyhistidine tag (20Mosher D.F. Huwiler K.G. Misenheimer T.M. Annis D.S. Methods Cell Biol. 2002; 69: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). E3Ca Asn-700 and E3Ca Ser-700 were made as described previously (17Hannah B.L. Misenheimer T.M. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8929-8934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Truncated proteins were designed to preserve the disulfide connectivity (10Misenheimer T.M. Hahr A.J. Harms A.C. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45882-45887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). DNA encoding residues 648–717 (Tr1), 648–740 (Tr2), 648–753 (Tr3), or 648–776 (Tr4) that contained the third EGF-like module and truncations of the Ca2+-binding repeats were generated by PCR amplification using E3Ca Asn-700 or E3Ca Ser-700 as template. The limits of these proteins are depicted in Fig. 1. The forward primer contained a BamHI site, and the reverse primer contained a PstI site. The PCR products were inserted into BamHI and PstI sites of pAcGP67.coco. Correct sequences of PCR-amplified DNAs were verified by DNA sequencing.Expression and Purification of Recombinant Proteins—Recombinant, infectious virus were generated as described previously (20Mosher D.F. Huwiler K.G. Misenheimer T.M. Annis D.S. Methods Cell Biol. 2002; 69: 69-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Passage three of the virus (>108 plaque-forming units/ml) was used to infect High-Five insect cells (Invitrogen) at a multiplicity of infection of five in SF-900 II serum-free medium at 22 °C. After 60–65 h, conditioned medium was harvested and dialyzed into 10 mm MOPS, 0.3 m NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2 (pH 7.5). Dialyzed medium was incubated with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin overnight at 4 °C, a column was poured with protein-bound resin, and protein was eluted in buffer containing 300 mm imidazole. Purified protein was dialyzed into 10 mm MOPS, 0.15 m NaCl, and 2 mm CaCl2, pH 7.5. Protein was stored in aliquots at –80 °C and thawed in a 25 °C water bath prior to use. All proteins were produced in yields ranging from 15 to 30 mg/liter conditioned medium and were soluble at concentrations of >1 mg/ml.Ca2+Binding—To determine the number of Ca2+ bound to Asn-700 and Ser-700 proteins, we performed equilibrium dialysis. Proteins were initially treated with 4 mm EDTA to remove Ca2+ and then dialyzed exhaustively at 4 °C into buffer containing 5 mm MOPS and 0.1 m NaCl (pH 7.5). Ca2+-depleted protein (45 μl) was then dialyzed at 37 °C for 4 h into the same buffer (350 μl) containing [Ca2+] varying from 10 μm to 2 mm plus trace 45CaCl2 (Amersham Biosciences) (21Misenheimer T.M. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1729-1733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 22Misenheimer T.M. Hannah B.L. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 5125-5132Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Following dialysis, the radioactivity of the protein and buffer samples was determined by scintillation counting, and the protein concentration of the protein samples was determined by BCA protein assay (Pierce). To calculate the [Ca2+] in the protein sample, enrichment of Ca2+ in the protein sample (counts in the protein sample divided by counts in the buffer sample) was multiplied by the [Ca2+] of the buffer. Subtraction of the buffer [Ca2+] yielded the concentration of protein bound Ca2+, and division by protein concentration yielded the number of Ca2+ bound to one molecule of protein. The Ca2+ binding data were fit to sigmoid curve that was used to relate the number of bound Ca2+ at various [Ca2+] to spectroscopic changes at the same [Ca2+].Intrinsic UV Fluorescence and Titration with Ca2+or Tb3+—Prior to fluorescence assays, recombinant proteins were treated with 4 mm EDTA to remove the Ca2+ and then dialyzed at 4 °C into buffer containing 5 mm MOPS and 0.1 m NaCl (pH 7.5), as described above. Dialyzed Asn-700 or Ser-700 proteins were titrated with Ca2+ or Tb3+ at 37 °C in an Aminco SLM 8100 or a JY Horiba Fluoromax 3 fluorimeter in 1-cm path length cells. Samples were excited at 295 nm. For samples titrated with Ca2+, emission spectra from 310 to 400 nm were recorded at each [Ca2+] from 0 mm to saturating [Ca2+]. For samples titrated with Tb3+, emission spectra were collected from 310 to 560 nm. The change in fluorescence intensity (ΔF) relative to the Ca2+-depleted protein from 0 mm to saturation was calculated asΔF=(F0−F)/(F0)(Eq. 1) where F0 is the total fluorescence at 0 mm Ca2+ or Tb3+, and F is the total fluorescence at a given [Ca2+] or [Tb3+]. The EC50 of the cation-sensitive structural transition was determined from the graph of ΔF versus [Ca2+] or [Tb3+]. The Hill coefficient was determined by calculating the slope of the line generated by log[ΔF/(1 – ΔF)] versus log[Ca2+]; values for ΔF used were taken from 30 to 70% of saturation.Stopped-flow Fluorescence—Stopped-flow was performed using an SX.18MV-R dual-syringe spectrophotometer (Applied Photophysics, Leatherhead, UK). Changes in tryptophan fluorescence over time were determined by exciting proteins at 295 nm and monitoring fluorescence using a 335-nm cut-off filter. All measurements were taken at 37 °C in 5mm MOPS and 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.5. The samples were incubated in the stopped-flow syringe for 4 min to allow for thermal equilibration, and then equal volumes of protein and Ca2+ were mixed. The reaction mixture contained a final concentration of 5 μm protein and various [Ca2+]. The dead time of the instrument was ∼1 ms. Kinetic traces were fitted to a second order exponential,F(t)=A1exp(−k1obst)+A2exp(−k2obst)+C(Eq. 2) where F is fluorescence at time t, A1 and A2 are amplitudes, k1obs and k2obs are observed rate constants, and C is the fluorescence at infinite time. Kinetic traces were analyzed using Igor Pro (WaveMetrics Inc., Lake Oswego, OR). Validity of the fit was evaluated by the residuals of the fit and the χ square value.RESULTSThe Ser-700 Polymorphism Subtly Alters the Titration of Ca2+Binding to E3Ca—Equilibrium dialysis with 45Ca2+ was performed on E3Ca Asn-700 and polymorphic E3Ca Ser-700, constructs of TSP-1 that contain the third EGF-like repeat together with the complete Ca2+-binding region. Ser-700 protein reproducibly bound 1–2 fewer Ca2+ at [Ca2+] of 60–200 μm (Fig. 2A). At saturating [Ca2+] of >250 μm, the assay was less reproducible, and there was overlap between the two proteins in the estimates of the number of Ca2+ bound. E3Ca Asn-700 bound an average of 25 ± 1 Ca2+, and E3Ca Ser-700 bound 23 ± 1 Ca2+ (X ± S.E., n = 3) (Table I). The concentrations of half-maximal binding for E3Ca Asn-700 and E3Ca Ser-700 were calculated to be 160 ± 10 and 180 ± 10 μm, respectively (Table I). The Hill coefficient (nH) of E3Ca Asn-700 was 3.5 ± 0.2, as compared with 3.9 ± 0.4 for E3Ca Ser-700, indicating positive cooperativity for both proteins (Table I).Fig. 2Ca2+ binding to E3Ca proteins and the dependence of fluorescence (FL) and CD changes for E3Ca proteins on number of Ca2+ bound. A, Ca2+ binding to E3Ca Asn-700 (closed circles) and E3Ca Ser-700 (open circles) was measured by equilibrium dialysis with 45Ca2+. The data were fit as described under “Experimental Procedures” to a sigmoid curve represented by the straight line for E3Ca Asn-700 and the dashed line for E3Ca Ser-700. The equation of the fit was used to determine the number of Ca2+ bound at various [Ca2+]. B, the change in signal of the fluorescence and CD data described previously in Ref. 17Hannah B.L.

The straight and dashed lines represent the intrinsic fluorescence of Trp-698 in E3Ca Asn-700 and E3Ca Ser-700, respectively.

Open table in a new tab Initial Ca2+Binding Events Alter Tryptophan Fluorescence—The titration of Ca2+ binding to the E3Ca constructs (Fig. 2A) was similar to titration of the characteristic far UV circular dichroism spectral changes, which reveals transitions of 150 ± 15 μm [Ca2+](nH = 5.1) and 168 ± 7 μm (nH = 6.1) for E3Ca Asn-700 and E3Ca Ser-700, respectively (17Hannah B.L. Misenheimer T.M. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8929-8934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). In contrast, titration of the fluorescence of a sole tryptophan, Trp-698, reveals transitions at lower [Ca2+], 70 ± 2 and 110 ± 6 μm for E3Ca Asn-700 and E3Ca Ser-700, respectively (17Hannah B.L. Misenheimer T.M. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8929-8934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). To compare the three types of titration curves, the Ca2+ binding data (Fig. 2A) were fit to sigmoid curves, and the number of Ca2+ bound at various [Ca2+] was calculated. With these estimates, we plotted the change in signal of the fluorescence and far UV CD described previously (17Hannah B.L. Misenheimer T.M. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8929-8934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) for E3Ca proteins against the number of Ca2+ bound (Fig. 2B). The change in CD signal for both proteins, when plotted as a function of bound Ca2+, demonstrated an initial steeper slope so that the curve was 75% complete when 15 Ca2+ were bound. The curve reached a plateau as the last 8–10 Ca2+ were bound. In contrast, the curves for the fluorescence signal of E3Ca Asn-700 and E3Ca Ser-700 were nearly complete when only 3–4 and 5–6 Ca2+, respectively, bound to the proteins.These results suggest that the first several Ca2+ that bind alter the environment of Trp-698 and therefore may bind to residues near Trp-698. The results also suggest that the presence of the Ser-700 polymorphism alters initial Ca2+ binding to residues near Trp-698 since more bound Ca2+ was required to change the environment of Trp-698 (Fig. 2B). To test these hypotheses directly, we generated four truncations of wild-type and polymorphic E3Ca that contain the third EGF-like repeat together with increasing numbers of C-terminal Ca2+-binding motifs (Fig. 1). Constructs were truncated based on the known disulfide connectivity of TSP-2 (10Misenheimer T.M. Hahr A.J. Harms A.C. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 45882-45887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) to prevent the presence of an unpaired cysteine. Therefore, Tr1, Tr3, and Tr4 lacked the C-terminal sequences required for a complete C-type motif (9Kvansakul M. Adams J.C. Hohenester E. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1).The Ser-700 Polymorphism Disrupts Ca2+Binding to Truncated Proteins—Binding of 45Ca2+ to Asn-700 constructs by equilibrium dialysis was sigmoidal for Tr4 Asn-700, Tr3 Asn-700, and Tr2 Asn-700 (Fig. 3, A–C). Removal of motifs from Asn-700 proteins caused a decrease in the maximal number of Ca2+ bound (Table I). Tr4 Asn-700 bound 5.9 ± 0.2 Ca2+, Tr3 Asn-700 bound 4.0 ± 0.1 Ca2+, and Tr2 Asn-700 bound 3.0 ± 0.1 Ca2+. The concentration of half-maximal binding occurred from 150 to 250 μm [Ca2+], depending on the size of the truncation (Table I). The calculated Hill coefficients for Tr4 Asn-700, Tr3 Asn-700, and Tr2 Asn-700 indicated positive cooperativity (Table I). Although the Hill coefficients did not significantly differ depending on the truncation size, all were lower than the Hill coefficient for Ca2+ binding to E3Ca Asn-700 (Table I). The titration curve for Tr1 Asn-700 (Fig. 3D) did not reach a plateau at high [Ca2+](>800 μm), and at this input concentration, Tr1 Asn-700 bound 1.2 ± 0.1 Ca2+ (X ± S.E., n = 4).Fig. 3Ca2+ binding to truncated proteins. Ca2+ binding to common and polymorphic Tr4 (A), Tr3 (B), Tr2 (C), and Tr1 (D) was measured by equilibrium dialysis with 45Ca2+. Closed black symbols represent wild-type proteins, and open gray symbols represent polymorphic proteins. Ca2+ binding data were fit to a sigmoid plot represented by a black and a gray line for Asn-700 and Ser-700 proteins, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)In contrast to the subtle differences of Ca2+ binding to E3Ca Asn-700 and E3Ca Ser-700 (Fig. 2A), greater differences in Ca2+ binding to Ser-700 as compared with Asn-700 truncation constructs were observed (Fig. 3 and Table I). For all truncated proteins, the presence of the Ser-700 polymorphism caused a decrease in the number of bound Ca2+ as compared with wild type at all [Ca2+] tested. The titration curves for Ser-700 truncations were also shifted to higher [Ca2+]. For instance, the titration curve for Tr4 Ser-700 was sigmoidal (Fig. 3A) and reached a binding plateau of 4.8 ± 0.5 Ca2+, lower than that for Tr4 Asn-700. The EC50 of Ca2+ binding for Tr4 Ser-700 was 420 ± 40 μm, higher than that observed for the Tr4 Asn-700. Ca2+ bound to Tr3 Ser-700, but the titration curve did not reach a plateau at high [Ca2+] (Fig. 3B). There was little binding of Ca2+ to Tr2 Ser-700, except at [Ca2+] greater than 600 μm (Fig. 3C), and Tr1 Ser-700 did not bind Ca2+ in the concentration range accessible to study by equilibrium dialysis (Fig. 3D).Ca2+-induced Quenching of Tryptophan Fluorescence Depends on the Size of the Truncation and the Presence of the Ser-700 Polymorphism—Since the presence of the Ser-700 polymorphism in truncation constructs caused a decrease in the number of Ca2+ bound, we next investigated whether this altered the ability of the proteins to achieve the Ca2+-bound conformation as assessed by the fluorescence properties of Trp-698. Asn-700 and Ser-700 truncation constructs were excited at 295 nm to excite Trp-698 specifically, and emission spectra were collected at 310–400 nm in the presence of various [Ca2+]. In the absence of Ca2+, all truncated constructs emitted at a peak wavelength (λmax) of ∼350 nm (Fig. 4, A–H). In the presence of 3 mm [Ca2+], the tryptophan fluorescence of Tr4 Asn-700, Tr3 Asn-700, and Tr2 Asn-700 was quenched ∼5-fold (Fig. 4, A, C, and E). Ca2+ also caused a shift in the λmax of these constructs to 337 nm. The addition of Ca2+ to Tr4 Ser-700 caused ∼4-fold quenching of fluorescence (Fig. 4B) and a shift in λmax to 341 nm. The quenching of Tr3 Ser-700 and Tr2 Ser-700 was less, 2.3- and 1.6-fold, respectively, with a smaller shift in λmax to 346 nm (Fig. 4, D and F). Little fluorescence quenching was seen for Tr1 Asn-700 and Tr1 Ser-700, 1.3- and 1.1-fold, respectively, with no shift in λmax (Fig. 4, G and H).Fig. 4Fluorescence spectra of truncated proteins. Tryptophan 698 in Tr4 Asn-700 (A), Tr4 Ser-700 (B), Tr3 Asn-700 (C), Tr3 Ser-700 (D), Tr2 Asn-700 (E), Tr2 Ser-700 (F), Tr1 Asn-700 (G), and Tr1 Ser-700 (H) was excited at 295 nm in 5 mm MOPS, 0.1 m NaCl in the absence (dashed line) and presence of 3 mm (solid line) Ca2+. Intrinsic fluorescence was measured from 310 to 400 nm, and spectra were recorded at each [Ca2+] from 0 mm to saturating [Ca2+].View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)The fractional change in total fluorescence for each protein relative to 0 μm [Ca2+] was calculated at each [Ca2+] and then plotted versus μm [Ca2+] (Fig. 5). With the exception of Tr2 Ser-700 and both Tr1 proteins, the titration curves for each protein were sigmoidal and exhibited positive cooperativity. Similar to E3Ca Asn-700, which titrated at 70 μm (17Hannah B.L. Misenheimer T.M. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8929-8934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), Tr4 Asn-700 had an EC50 of 80 ± 1 μm (Table I). Further truncation caused the fluorescence of Tr3 Asn-700, Tr2 Asn-700, and Tr1 Asn-700, to titrate at increasing [Ca2+] (Table I). The cooperativity of the fluorescence change for Tr4 Asn-700 (2.4 ± 0.1) was decreased as compared with E3Ca Asn-700 (3.8) (17Hannah B.L. Misenheimer T.M. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8929-8934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Although Tr3 Asn-700 exhibited similar cooperativity as Tr4 Asn-700, further truncation to Tr2 and Tr1 Asn-700 resulted in decreased cooperativity (Table I). The presence of the Ser-700 polymorphism caused the fluorescence of the truncated proteins to titrate at higher [Ca2+] than the Asn-700 proteins, and this difference was magnified in each successive truncation (Table I). Consistent with this trend, Tr4 Ser-700 titrated at higher [Ca2+] (240 ± 1 μm) as compared with E3Ca Ser-700 (110 μm) (17Hannah B.L. Misenheimer T.M. Annis D.S. Mosher D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8929-8934Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Similar to E3Ca proteins, the cooperativity of the fluorescence transition for Tr4 Ser-700 (3.0 ± 0.2) was higher than that for Tr4 Asn-700 (2.4 ± 0.1). However, further truncation resulted in decreased cooperativity for Tr3 Ser-700 and Tr2 Ser-700 as compar"
https://openalex.org/W2007603327,"Most site-specific recombinases can be grouped into two mechanistically distinct families. Whereas tyrosine recombinases exchange DNA strands through a Holliday intermediate, serine recombinases such as Hin generate double-strand breaks in each recombining partner. Here, site-directed protein crosslinking is used to elucidate the configuration of protein subunits and DNA within the Hin synaptic complex and to follow the movement of protein subunits during DNA strand exchange. Our results show that the protein interface mediating synapsis is localized to a region within the catalytic domains, thereby positioning the DNA strands on the outside of the Hin tetrameric complex. Unexpected crosslinks between residues within the dimerization helices provide evidence for a conformational change that accompanies DNA cleavage. We demonstrate that the Hin subunits, which are linked to the cleaved DNA ends by serine-phosphodiester bonds, translocate between synapsed dimers to exchange the DNA strands."

Solvent-exposed side chains of three of the tyrosines have a repeat distance similar to that of a poly-l-proline type II helix. The aromatic surface ends at one of the tyrosines, where the groove curves almost 90° away from the linear arrangement of the three tyrosine side chains, possibly inducing a bent conformation in the bound peptide. This finding is consistent with previous suggestions by others that a minimal structural requirement for proline 4-hydroxylation may be a sequence in the poly-l-proline type II conformation followed by a β-turn in the Pro-Gly segment.

The interaction of peptide substrates with the C-P4Hs is further affected by the amino acid in the X position of the X-Pro-Gly triplet to be hydroxylated, by other nearby amino acids, and by the peptide conformation, with the triple helical conformation of the collagenous peptides completely preventing hydroxylation (1Kivirikko K.I.

Poly-l-proline is an effective competitive inhibitor of type I C-P4H but only a very weak inhibitor of the type II, there being also smaller differences between these two isoenzymes in the binding properties with respect to peptide substrates, whereas the recently identified type III C-P4H appears to be intermediate between the type I and type II enzymes in this respect (1Kivirikko K.I.

The recombinant domain was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described earlier (14Hieta R. Kukkola L. Permi P. Pirilä P. Kivirikko K.I. Kilpeläinen I. Myllyharju J. J. Biol.

D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 940-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Se-Met derivatization of the protein was performed by expressing it in a methionine-requiring auxotroph E. coli strain B384 (DE3) using induction for 20 h at 20 °C. All tyrosine residues in the peptide-substrate-binding domain and the corresponding residues in the full-length α(I)-subunit were converted individually to alanine using a QuikChange™ site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The sequences were verified on an automated DNA sequencer (Abi Prism 377; Applied Biosystems). Recombinant type I C-P4H tetramers were expressed in insect cells as described previously (11Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 13Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) by coinfecting them with recombinant baculoviruses encoding the wild-type or mutant α(I)-subunits and the PDI polypeptide. The cells were harvested 72 h after infection, homogenized in a Triton X-100-containing buffer, and centrifuged (11Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1173-1180Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 13Myllyharju J. Kivirikko K.I. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Aliquots of the soluble proteins were analyzed by nondenaturing PAGE, and P4H activity was assayed by a method based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate (28Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Km values for (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 were determined as described (29Myllylä R. Tuderman L. Kivirikko K.I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1977; 80: 349-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), and IC50 values for poly-l-proline, Mr 5000–8000, were measured by adding increasing concentrations of this peptide to the enzyme reaction mixture. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—The ITC experiments were performed using a VP-ITC titration microcalorimeter (Microcal, Northampton, MA) as described previously (14Hieta R. Kukkola L. Permi P. Pirilä P. Kivirikko K.I. Kilpeläinen I. Myllyharju J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34966-34974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In the individual titrations, 5-μl doses of 1–5 mm solutions of (Pro-Pro-Gly)10 or poly-l-proline, Mr 5000–8000 (in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8) were injected into a sample cell (volume 1.4476 ml) containing 0.05–0.3 mm of the wild-type or mutant peptide-substrate-binding domain in the above buffer at an interval of 4 min with stirring at 300 rpm. The titration data obtained were corrected by subtracting the heat of dilution of the peptides from the raw data and fitted by the non-linear least squares minimization method using the one set of sites model (Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm) to determine the dissociation constant (Kd) using Origin software (Microcal). Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of the recombinant C-P4H α(I) peptide-substrate-binding domain were grown by the changing drop vapor diffusion method as described previously (23Pekkala M. Hieta R. Kursula P. Kivirikko K.I. Wierenga R.K. Myllyharju J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2003; 59: 940-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). An addition of 10 mm urea to the crystallization drops was found to improve the quality of the crystals. Briefly, 2-μl drops of a protein solution, 10 mg/ml, in 20 mm bis-Tris, 100 mm glycine, pH 6.8, and 10 mm urea, were mixed with 2 μl of a well solution of 1.4 m ammonium phosphate, pH 8.4. The crystals were soaked for 30 s in a solution of 1.6 m ammonium phosphate, pH 8.4, and 20% glycerol as a cryoprotectant prior to flash freezing in a stream of cold (100 K) N2. All data were collected from frozen crystals. The structure was resolved using a 2.8 Å resolution three-multiwavelength multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data set collected from crystals grown from the Se-Met-derivatized protein. A 2.3 Å data set was subsequently collected from a crystal presoaked briefly in a mother liquor that also contained a potential ligand peptide, Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly. No ligand was bound, however, and consequently this data set will be referred to as a native one. All the data sets were processed with XDS (30Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1988; 21: 916-924Crossref Scopus (1681) Google Scholar). Further data handling employed programs available in the CCP4 package (31Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Open table in a new tab Structure Determination and Structural Analysis—The three-multiwavelength multiwavelength anomalous dispersion data set was analyzed with SOLVE (32Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar), which resulted in finding six Se sites of approximately equal occupancy. The mean figure of merit of the calculated phase sets was 0.65 for the 2.8 Å data set. The asymmetric unit comprises two molecules, each having three methionines, with all six methionines apparently being well ordered. An initial model consisting of 120 residues could be built up using RESOLVE (32Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). The phases were improved by solvent flattening using DM (31Number Collaborative Computational Project Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19749) Google Scholar), and a complete model could be built up for both molecules using O (33Jones A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W.

This model was further refined at 2.3 Å resolution against the native data set with weak NCS restraints, with 73 water molecules having been added. No other solvent molecules were found in the electron density maps. The refinement statistics for the native structure are summarized in Table I. The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (accession code 1TJC). The quality of the model was monitored with PROCHECK (36Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar), and the structure was analyzed with O and ICM (37Abagyan R.A. Totrov M.M. Kuznetsov D.N. J. Comput. Chem. 1994; 15: 488-506Crossref Scopus (1362) Google Scholar). The fold of the C-P4H α(I) peptide-substrate-binding domain was compared with known folds in the Protein Data Bank using the DALI server (38Holm L. Sander C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). Figs. 2, 3, 4 were made with the ICM package (37Abagyan R.A. Totrov M.M. Kuznetsov D.N. J. Comput. Chem. 1994; 15: 488-506Crossref Scopus (1362) Google Scholar), which was also used to build a poly-l-proline helix in the type II (PPII) conformation (ϕ = –69°, ψ = 149°, χ1 = 27°). The secondary structure was calculated using DSSP (39Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12277) Google Scholar).Fig. 3Comparison of the C-P4H α(I) peptide-substrate-binding domain with the Pex5 and Hop TPR domains complexed with a peptide.

The only cysteine in the domain, Cys150, was mutated to serine, and the C terminus contained a six-histidine tag. The recombinant domain produced in E. coli has three methionines, the translation initiation methionine, Met170, and Met235 (numbered according to the α(I)-subunit residues). It therefore seemed possible to resolve the structure by derivatization with Se-Met, performed by expressing the polypeptide in a medium containing this amino acid. The crystal structure of the domain was refined at 2.3 Å resolution with good refinement statistics (Table I). All the residues have ϕ/ψ values in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. It is an all-helical protein with five α-helices running antiparallel to each other (Fig. 2). There are two molecules/asymmetric unit, with the polypeptide chain of each molecule being well defined from the N terminus until residue 237. There are no regions with high B factors, except for the seven C-terminal residues that are disordered. The two molecules of the asymmetric unit have the same structure, so that on superposition of residues 143–237 of the two molecules, for example, the root mean square difference between the corresponding Cα atoms is 0.2 Å. The Helical Bundle of the Domain Is a 2.5-TPR Repeat—The five antiparallel α-helices create a bowl-like surface, with helices α1 and α5 at the rim, α2, α3, and α4 on the bottom, and α3 the central helix (Fig. 2). Comparison of the fold of the domain with other structures present in the Protein Data Bank, using the DALI server (39Kabsch W. Sander C. Biopolymers. 1983; 22: 2577-2637Crossref PubMed Scopus (12277) Google Scholar), indicated that the C-P4H α(I) peptide-substrate-binding domain has a high structural similarity to TPR domains. The TPR motif is a 34-residue repeat consisting of two antiparallel α-helices. Naturally occurring domains that are assembled from TPR motifs often comprise a number of these motifs plus an additional α-helix, referred to as the “solvating” helix (24Main E.R.G. Xiong Y. Cocco M.J. D'Andrea L. Regan L. Structure. 2003; 11: 497-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 25D'Andrea L.D. Regan L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 655-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). The C-P4H domain has two TPR motifs, referred to as TPR-1 and TPR-2, plus the solvating helix (Fig. 2), which are also indicated in Fig. 1. Most characterized TPR domains have at least three motifs (25D'Andrea L.D. Regan L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2003; 28: 655-662Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (860) Google Scholar). Because the sequence similarity between TPR units is very low, it was not known that the C-P4H domain would have this structure.

Arabidopsis thaliana SCP-2 (AtSCP-2) consists of 123 amino acids with a molecular mass of 13.6 kDa. AtSCP-2 shows 35% identity and 56% similarity to the human SCP-2-like domain present in the human D-bifunctional protein (DBP) and 30% identity and 54% similarity to the human SCP-2 encoded by SCP-X. The presented structural models of apo-AtSCP-2 and the ligand-bound conformation of AtSCP-2 reveal remarkable similarity with two of the structurally known SCP-2s, the SCP-2-like domain of human DBP and the rabbit SCP-2, correspondingly. The AtSCP-2 models in both forms have a similar hydrophobic ligand-binding tunnel, which is extremely suitable for lipid binding. AtSCP-2 showed in vitro transfer activity of BODIPY-phosphatidylcholine (BODIPY-PC) from donor membranes to acceptor membranes. The transfer of BODIPY-PC was almost completely inhibited after addition of 1-palmitoyl 2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine or ergosterol. Dimyristoyl phosphatidic acid, stigmasterol, steryl glucoside, and cholesterol showed a moderate to marginal ability to lower the BODIPY-PC transfer rate, and the single chain palmitic acid and stearoyl-coenzyme A did not affect transfer at all. Expression analysis showed that AtSCP-2 mRNA is accumulating in most plant tissues. Plasmids carrying fusion genes between green fluorescent protein and AtSCP-2 were transformed with particle bombardment to onion epidermal cells. The results from analyzing the transformants indicate that AtSCP-2 is localized to peroxisomes.

The core of the SCP-2 protein forms a five-stranded β-sheet flanked by five α-helices. A C-terminal segment, together with part of the β-sheet and four α-helices form a hydrophobic tunnel constituting the binding site for cholesterol, phospholipids, fatty acids, and fatty acyl coenzyme A (1Choinowski T. Hauser H. Piontek K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1897-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 2Haapalainen A.M. van Aalten D.M. Merilainen G. Jalonen J.E. Pirila P. Wierenga R.K. Hiltunen J.K.

Biol. 2000; 295: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The human 13.2-kDa SCP-2 is encoded by the gene SCP-X, which apart from SCP-2 encodes thiolase. SCP-X has two separate promoters controlling the transcription of two transcripts of 3.2 and 1.8 kb, respectively (4Yamamoto R. Kallen C.B. Babalola G.O. Rennert H. Billheimer J.T. Strauss J.F. II I Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 463-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Translation of the longer messenger RNA yields the 58-kDa protein SCP-X, which consists of thiolase carrying SCP-2 in the C terminus. The shorter transcript is translated into pre-SCP-2 of 15 kDa. The mature SCP-2 is formed by cleavage of either SCP-X or pre-SCP-2. SCP-2 carries a peroxisomal targeting signal in the C-terminal, and is predominantly localized in the peroxisomes although a substantial proportion is present in other cellular locations, such as the mitochondria, cytoplasm, and the endoplasmic reticulum (reviewed in Ref. 5Gallegos A.M. Atshaves B.P. Storey S.M. Starodub O. Petrescu A.D. Huang H. McIntosh A.L. Martin G.G. Chao H. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 498-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). SCP-2 was originally described as a sterol-binding protein, and one of the hypotheses regarding its function is that SCP-2 is involved in cytosolic non-vesicular transfer of cholesterol (5Gallegos A.M. Atshaves B.P. Storey S.M. Starodub O. Petrescu A.D. Huang H. McIntosh A.L. Martin G.G. Chao H. Kier A.B. Schroeder F. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 498-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). There is some experimental support for this hypothesis, such as results showing that the intracellular transport of cholesterol to the plasma membrane slows down when fibroblasts are treated with SCP-2 antisense oligonucleotides (6Puglielli L. Rigotti A. Greco A.V. Santos M.J. Nervi F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18723-18726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Moreover, there was an increase in the rates of cholesterol transfer to the plasma membrane when SCP-2 was overexpressed in rat hepatoma cells (7Baum C.L. Reschly E.J. Gayen A.K. Groh M.E. Schadick K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6490-6498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). A second hypothesis suggests that SCP-2 plays a role in peroxisomal oxidation of fatty acids, where it might facilitate the presentation of the substrates and/or stabilizing the enzymes involved in catalyzing the reaction cycles (8Seedorf U. Ellinghaus P. Nofer J.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1486: 45-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). This hypothesis gains support from experiments showing interactions in the peroxisomes between SCP-2 and enzymes involved in β-oxidation such as acyl-CoA oxidase, 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase, and the bifunctional enzyme (9Wouters F.S. Bastiaens P.I. Wirtz K.W. Jovin T.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7179-7189Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Furthermore, gene targeting in mice (10Seedorf U. Raabe M. Ellinghaus P. Kannenberg F. Fobker M. Engel T. Denis S. Wouters F. Wirtz K.W. Wanders R.J. Maeda N. Assmann G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1189-1201Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar) revealed that complete deficiency of SCP-2 resulted in an impaired catabolism of methyl branched-chain fatty acyl-CoAs as shown by a 10-fold accumulation of phytanic acid in SCP-2(-/-) mice. In mammals, a SCP-2 domain is also present in the D-bifunctional protein (DBP). DBP is formed as an 80-kDa precursor with domains for acyl-CoA-dehydrogenase, 2-enoyl-CoA-hydratase, and SCP-2 (11Leendeers F. Husen B. Thole J. Adamski J. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1994; 104: 127-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Processing occurs after transport to the peroxisomes at the junction between acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase. The 80-kDa fusion protein as well as the SCP-2-like domain were shown to have lipid transfer activities similar to SCP-2 (12Leenders F. Tesdorpf J.G. Markus M. Engel T. Seedorf U. Adamski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5438-5442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The function of the SCP-2-like domain in DBP remains unclear. The domain may be required to ensure the peroxisomal localization of the whole protein. Although, the structural and functional conservation may indicate that the SCP-2-like domain has additional functions, such as transfer of substrates for DBP from the peroxisomal membrane to the catalytically active site in the peroxisomal matrix (12Leenders F. Tesdorpf J.G. Markus M. Engel T. Seedorf U. Adamski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5438-5442Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). A SCP-2 domain is also present in the Caenorhabditis elegans behavioral gene unc-24. The unc-24 gene encodes a bipartite protein with a domain similar to part of two ion channel regulators (the erythrocyte integral membrane protein stomatin and the C. elegans neuronal protein MEC-2) juxtaposed to a domain similar to SCP-2 (13Barnes T.M. Jin Y. Horvitz H.R. Ruvkun G. Hekimi S. J. Neurochem. 1996; 67: 46-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Unc-24 mutants are known to have difficulty in moving forward. UNC-24 is a membrane protein and it has been suggested that the SCP-2 domain is involved in the transfer of lipids between adjacent membranes. The human homologue of unc-24 is known as SLP-1, which also is a bipartite protein with a stomatin-like domain as well as a SCP-2 domain (14Seidel G. Prohaska R. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 225: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The fused SCP-X protein can be traced back to Drosophila melanogaster suggesting that SCP-X/SCP-2 fusions are widespread in vertebrates and insects. DBP enzymes with SCP-2-like domains have been detected in vertebrates, insects, nematodes, fungi (15Requena N. Fuller P. Franken P. Mol. Plant Microbe Interact. 1999; 12: 934-942Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and the slime mold Dictyostelium (16Matsuoka S. Saito T. Kuwayama H. Morita N. Ochiai H. Maeda M. Eukaryotic Cell. 2003; 2: 638-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Peroxisomal SCP-2-like proteins are also present in some budding yeasts, such as Candida tropicalis (17Tan H. Bun-Ya M. Hirata A. Kamiryo T. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1065-1074Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and Candida maltosa (18Hwang C.W. Yano K. Takagi M. Gene (Amst.). 1991; 106: 61-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In these yeasts a separate gene without any fusion partner encodes SCP-2.

Curiously, it has never been reported that plants contain any SCP-2-like protein. In this report we provide evidence that also plants express a peroxisomal SCP-2 protein with lipid transfer activity. Plant Materials and Bacterial Strains—We used Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0). Seeds were surface sterilized (washed in 70% ethanol for 2 min and in 15% chlorine and 0.5% SDS for 10 min followed by at least four washes in sterile-distilled water) and sown on 1× Murashige and Skoog medium (MS) (24Murashige T. Skoog F. Physiol. Plant. 1962; 15: 473-497Crossref Scopus (54339) Google Scholar). Before cultivation, seed dormancy was broken by 3 to 4 days of cold treatment (4 °C). Plants grown under nonsterile conditions were planted on soil mixed with vermiculite (2:1). The plants were cultivated under controlled environmental chambers at 20 to 22 °C under long day (18 h of light and 6 h of darkness) conditions. Onions, Allium cepa L., used for detection of green fluorescent protein fusions were picked from a garden. Escherichia coli strains DH5α and TOP10 were used for general cloning and blue/white screening. E. coli BL21 was used for heterologous expression of AtSCP-2. Chemicals—To examine the intermembrane lipid transfer capability of AtSCP-2 we used the following fluorescent lipids, BODIPY-phosphatidylcholine (BODIPY-PC), BODIPY-glucosylceramide (BODIPY-GlcCer), and NBD-ceramide. As the non-transferable energy acceptor in these fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays we used DiI-C18. These lipids were all obtained from Molecular Probes. Anthrylvinyl-galactosylceramide (AV-GalCer) was also examined as a potential substrate for transfer activity, and as its nontransferable energy acceptor pair we used perylenoyl-triolein (Per-TG). These lipids were synthesized as described previously (25Mattjus P. Molotkovsky J.G. Smaby J.M. Brown R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 268: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Bovine brain ceramide and cholesterol were from Sigma and 1-palmitoyl 2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC), dimyristoyl phosphatidic acid (DMPA), β-sitosterol, desmosterol, steryl glucoside (soybean), stigmasterol, palmitic acid, stearoyl-CoA, and ergosterol from Larodan AB, Malmö, Sweden. Bioinformatics—DNA and amino acid sequence data bases were searched using BLAST (26Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schäffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (60233) Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignment was created using Clustal X (27Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35620) Google Scholar) and the resulting similarities were then visualized by subjecting the alignment to Boxshade. 2K. Hofmann and M. Baron, unpublished data. Peptide sequence data were analyzed using the BioLynx program of the MassLynx NT software package (version 3.4, Micromass Ltd., Manchester, United Kingdom). AtSCP-2 Modeling—Two structural models of AtSCP-2 were generated: the structure of AtSCP-2 without ligand was modeled using as template the rabbit SCP-2 structure (Protein Data Bank code 1C44 (1Choinowski T. Hauser H. Piontek K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1897-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar)) and the structure of AtSCP-2 in the putative ligand-bound form using as template the SCP-2-like domain of human DBP (Protein Data Bank code 1IKT (2Haapalainen A.M. van Aalten D.M. Merilainen G. Jalonen J.E. Pirila P. Wierenga R.K. Hiltunen J.K. Glumoff T. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 313: 1127-1138Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar)). The rabbit SCP-2 has no visible ligand, whereas the human SCP-2-like protein has a Triton X-100 molecule bound in its inner hydrophobic cavity mimicking the ligand binding. The third known SCP-2 x-ray structure, SCP-2 from yellow fever mosquito (Protein Data Bank code 1PZ4 (28Dyer D.H. Lovell S. Thoden J.B. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Lan Q. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 39085-39091Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar)), was used for structural comparison. The three SCP-2 structures were superimposed using the program VERTAA in the Bodil modeling environment (29Lehtonen J.V. Rantanen V-V. Still D.-J. Ekholm J. Björklund D. Iftikhar Z. Huhtala M. Jussila A. Jaakkola J. Pentikäinen O. Nyrönen T. Salminen T.A. Gyllenberg M. Johnson M.S. J. Computer-Aided Mol. Des. 2004; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). The sequence alignment of the three structurally known SCP-2 sequences and the AtSCP-2 sequence was performed within Bodil using the program MALIGN (30Johnson M.S. Lehtonen J.V. Higgins D. Taylor W. Bioinformatics. Oxford University Press, Oxford2000: 15-50Google Scholar, 31Johnson M.S. Overington J.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 233: 716-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). The alignment was then refined taking into consideration structural features derived from the structure-based sequence alignment as well as conserved positions in the multiple sequence alignment of plant SCP-2 (Fig. 1). Based on the final sequence alignment and using both of the template structures, a set of 10 different models was made for apo-AtSCP-2 and the ligand-bound conformation of AtSCP-2 using the program MODELLER (32Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar). From each set of models, the one with the lowest value of the MODELLER objective function was chosen for further analysis. The two final models were compared with each other and to the template structures by superimposing them on each other using the program VERTAA within Bodil. The models were also analyzed with the program Surfnet (33Laskowski R.A. J. Mol. Graph. 1995; 13: 323-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar) to identify cavities within the structures. The cavities were visualized with Bodil. Expression and Purification of AtSCP-2 in E. coli—The cDNA clone U11030 carrying the AtSCP-2 cDNA inserted into vector pUni51 was obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. The coding region was amplified from plasmid U11030 by the use of primers SCPAtNE (5′-ACTGGAATTCAACTCAAATCCGATGCAATCATG-3′) and SCPAtCN (5′-TCATGGCGGCCGCTCACAACTTTGAAGGTTTAGGGA-3′). The obtained PCR fragment was digested with restriction enzymes EcoRI and NotI, and subcloned into the EcoRI-NotI site of the vector pGEX-5X-2 (Amersham Biosciences) to obtain a gene fusion between gluthatione S-transferase (GST) and AtSCP-2. The AtSCP-2 insert in the obtained plasmid pGEX-SCPAt was confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmid pGEX-SCPAt was transformed into E. coli BL21 cells. The cells were grown overnight in 5 ml of LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin in 37 °C. In the morning the cells were diluted 40 times in 200 ml of LB containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. When A600 reached 0.6–0.7 expression of the GST-AtSCP-2 was induced with the addition of 0.6 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cells were then grown for an additional 3 h. For preparation of cell extracts and purification of GST-AtSCP-2 we followed the procedures described in the handbook for the GST Gene Fusion System (Amersham Bioscience). Bacterial cells were pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in 10 ml of 1× phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were lysed by sonication for 12 × 15 s with a Labsonic U sonicator (B. Braun, Germany). The lysate was centrifuged in 4 °C for 20 min at 10,000 × g. The supernatant was decanted and saved. For adsorbing the GST-AtSCP-2 fusion protein, 200 μl of a 50% slurry of glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences) was added to 10 ml of the bacterial extract. The mixture was incubated for 30 min in room temperature and then centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min to sediment the matrix. The matrix was washed three times with 1× phosphate-buffered saline. To release AtSCP-2 from the GST-tag, 5 μg of Factor Xa (Amersham Biosciences) and 100 μl of Factor Xa cleavage buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2) were added to the glutathione-Sepharose pellet. The cleavage reaction was incubated for 16 h at room temperature. The suspension was then centrifuged at 500 × g for 5 min. The supernatant was removed to a fresh tube and saved. To increase the yield of the AtSCP-2 protein the glutathione-Sepharose suspension was washed with 100 μl of 1× phosphate-buffered saline. The protein concentration in the supernatants was 2 μg/μl, indicating that the yield of the purified recombinant AtSCP-2 was ∼2 mg/liter of bacterial culture. Glycerol was added to a final concentration of 15%, before placing the supernatants in -20 °C. Five μg of the purified protein fraction was analyzed by one-dimensional gel electrophoresis on NuPAGE 4–12% BisTris gels (Invitrogen) using an MES running buffer (50 mm MES, 50 mm Tris, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.3). The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and the protein band of interest was excised using a sharp knife, cut into smaller parts, and then washed in water. The protein was in-gel digested with trypsin, extracted, and analyzed by mass spectroscopy. For the mass analysis we used an instrument equipped with quadrupole and time-of-flight mass detectors (Micromass Q-Tof, Micromass Ltd.) with a nanospray ion source using the procedure described previously (34Eklund D.M. Edqvist J. Plant Physiol. 2003; 132: 1249-1259Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which is a slightly modified version of a method described by Mann and co-workers (35Wilm M. Shevchenko A. Houthaeve T. Breit S. Schweigerer L. Fotsis T. Mann M. Nature. 1996; 379: 466-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (1507) Google Scholar). FRET Assay for Monitoring SCP-2-mediated Lipid Intermembrane Transfer—The FRET method used for measuring (Cary Eclipse, Varian) the transfer of lipids between two bilayer vesicle populations has been thoroughly described previously (25Mattjus P. Molotkovsky J.G. Smaby J.M. Brown R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 268: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 36Mattjus P. Kline A. Pike H.M. Molotkovsky J.G. Brown R.E.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Briefly, a FRET assay utilizing a labeled lipid that served as the energy donor (1 mol %) and a nontransferable lipid as the energy acceptor (3.0 mol %) permitted continuous real time monitoring of AtSCP-2 activity. Small unilamellar bovine brain sphingomyelin/cholesterol mixed (6:1) donor vesicles containing the fluorescent lipids were prepared by probe sonication. Bovine brain sphingomyelin/cholesterol acceptor vesicles were also prepared by sonication. The acceptor vesicles were in 10-fold excess. Calculation of the transfer rate was achieved by fitting to first-order exponential behavior as previously described in detail (25Mattjus P. Molotkovsky J.G. Smaby J.M. Brown R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 268: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 36Mattjus P. Kline A. Pike H.M. Molotkovsky J.G. Brown R.E.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). As a positive transfer control we used a transfer protein specific for glycolipids (25Mattjus P. Molotkovsky J.G. Smaby J.M. Brown R.E. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 268: 297-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 36Mattjus P. Kline A. Pike H.M. Molotkovsky J.G. Brown R.E.

Chem. 2000; 275: 5104-5110Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Competition Assay—To analyze different unlabeled lipids as potential substrates for AtSCP-2 we used a competition assay. After the above described FRET BODIPY-PC assay was started by addition of AtSCP-2 and after a steady transfer rate was reached, unlabeled lipids were added as liposomes to the reaction mixture. This would result in a decrease in the transfer rate of the fluorescently labeled phosphatidylcholine because of the presence of a new transferable lipid pool of AtSCP-2 substrate. If the added lipid is not a substrate for AtSCP-2 no deviation in the slope of the transfer rate would occur. Similar types of approaches have been used previously (40Dansen T.B. Westerman J. Wouters F.S. Wanders R.J. van Hoek A. Gadella Jr., T.W. Wirtz K.W. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 193-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Transformation and Visualization of smRSGFP Constructs—The vector psmRS-GFP is a pUC118-based plasmid carrying the 35S-promoter in front of a soluble modified red-shifted GFP (smRS-GFP) followed by the NOS1 terminator (41Davis S.J. Vierstra R.D. Weeds World. 1996; 3: 43-48Google Scholar). This vector was used for construction of plasmids pER6 and pER7, which both encode AtSCP-2-GFP fusion proteins (Fig. 7). Plasmid pER6 carries a SCP-2-GFP fusion with AtSCP-2 in the N terminus and smRS-GFP in the C terminus. This plasmid was constructed by amplifying AtSCP-2 cDNA using primers SCPBAMN (5′-AGTGGATCCATGGCGAATACCCAACTCAAATC-3′) and SCPBAMC (5′-CTTGGATCCCCAACTTTGAAGGTTTAGGGAAGAT-3′). The PCR product was cleaved with BamHI and ligated to the BamHI site of psmRS-GFP. Plasmid pER7 encodes a fusion protein with smRS-GFP in the N terminus and AtSCP-2 in the C terminus. This plasmid was constructed by amplifying AtSCP-2 cDNA using primers SCPAtNE (5′-ACTGGAATTCAACTCAAATCCGATGCAATCATG-3′) and SCPAtCS (5′-TCATTGAGCTCTCACAACTTTGAAGGTTTAGGGA3′). The obtained PCR fragment contains an EcoRI site in the N-terminal region of the AtSCP-2 gene and a SacI site in the C-terminal region. Furthermore, smRS-GFP was amplified using primers GFPNBAM (5′-AGCGGATCCAAGGAGATATAACAATGA-3′) and GFPCECO (5′-CTTGAATTCCTTTGTATAGTTCATCCATGCCATG-3′), an amplification that yielded a PCR fragment with a BamHI site in the N-terminal part of the GFP gene and a EcoRI site in the part of the gene encoding the C terminus. The SCPAtNE-SCPAtCS fragment was cleaved with restriction enzymes EcoRI + SacI, whereas the GFPNBAM-GFPCECO-amplified fragment was digested with BamHI + EcoRI. The fragments were then ligated to psmRS-GFP that had been cut with endonucleases BamHI and SacI. Biolistic transformation of onion epidermis was done essentially according to previously published procedures (42Scott A. Wyatt S. Tsou P.L. Robertson D. Strömgren-Allen N.

Plant J. 2002; 32: 93-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Approximately 2 mg of 1 μm of gold particles were resuspended in 25 μl of DNA solution consisting of plasmid DNA (1 μg/ml) and H2O. 220 μl of H2O, 250 μl of 2.5 m CaCl2, and 50 μl of 0.1 m spermidine were added to the DNA/gold suspension. The mixture was vortexed for 2 min, incubated on ice for 3 min, and vortexed in a cold room (4 °C) for 10 min. The mixture was centrifuged at 6000 × g for 3 min in 4 °C. The supernatant was removed, and the DNA/microprojectile precipitate was resuspended in 600 μl of 100% ethanol. The tube was centrifuged for 1 min, and the ethanol was removed. The DNA/microprocetile precipitate was resuspended in 40 μl of 100% ethanol. The DNA/gold suspension was distributed to three separate rupture disks. Onion pieces were placed on agar plates containing 1× MS. The onion pieces were bombarded using a Biolistic PDS 1000/He Biolistic Particle Delivery System (Bio-Rad) with 900 p.s.i. rupture discs under a vacuum of 0.1 bar. After bombardment the onion pieces were left to recover on MS plates for 24 h in 22 °C. The onion pieces were then stored in a cold room (4 °C). Onion skin epidermal layers were peeled from the onion pieces. The peels were placed on glass slides and examined with a Zeiss Axioskop 2 MOT fluorescence light microscope. The GFP signal was detected using a fluorescein isothiocyanate filter (excitation 480 nm, emission 535 nm, dichronic beamsplitter 505 nm). Preparation of Antibodies against SCP-2—The synthetic peptide SCP1 with the amino acid sequence AQKFTPEIFPKP was designed based on the amino acid sequences of the plant SCP-2 sequences. A sequence close to the C terminus was chosen for immunization because of its high conservation and its presumed exposed position.

Within the testis, immunohistological analysis localized human mGPDH to late spermatids and to the midpiece of spermatozoa. The expression of human mGPDH is regulated by two somatic promoters, and here, we describe a third testis-specific promoter of human mGPDH. The usage of this testis-specific promoter correlates with the expression of a shortened mGPDH transcript of ∼2.4 kb in length, which is solely detectable from testicular RNA. Within the testis-specific promoter, we detected a cAMP-response element (CRE) site at -51, which binds the testis-specific transcriptional activator CRE modulator τ (CREMτ) in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. This recognition site overlaps with a nuclear receptor binding half-site at -49, which binds the testis-specific transcriptional repressor germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF). Both factors compete for binding to the same DNA response element. Ectopic expression of CREMτ in HepG2 cells activated a promoter-driven luciferase construct in transient transfection experiments. Additional cotransfection of GCNF relieved this activity, suggesting a down-regulation of CREMτ-mediated activation by GCNF. This effect was preserved by introducing the CRE/nuclear receptor-binding element into a heterologous promoter context. Our data suggest a down-regulation of CREMτ-mediated gene expression by GCNF, which might be a general regulation mechanism for several postmeiotically expressed genes with a temporal expression peak during early spermatid development.

Within the testis, spermatogenesis is a complex developmental process that includes the mitotic proliferation of spermatogonial stem cells, meiotic prophase, division of spermatocytes, and morphological changes of haploid spermatids to highly specialized spermatozoa (reviewed in Ref. 11Russell L.D.

The developmental program of spermatogenesis is regulated by several testis-specific transcription factors, e.g. the cAMP-response element modulator τ (CREMτ) or the germ cell nuclear factor (GCNF). CREMτ, a testis-specific transcriptional activator, is an alternative splice product of the CREM gene belonging to a family of proteins, which are regulated by cAMP and bind to cAMP DNA-response elements (CREs) (consensus sequence: 5′-TGACGTCA-3′) (12Behr R. Weinbauer G.F. Int. J. Androl. 2001; 24: 126-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 13Don J. Stelzer G. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2002; 187: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Target gene disruption of the CREM gene (including CREMτ) leads to infertility in transgenic mice (14Blendy J.A. Kaestner K.H. Weinbauer G.F. Nieschlag E. Schutz G. Nature. 1996; 380: 162-165Crossref PubMed Scopus (468) Google Scholar, 15Nantel F. Monaco L. Foulkes N.S. Masquilier D. LeMeur M. Henriksen K. Dierich A. Parvinen M. Sassone-Corsi P. Nature. 1996; 380: 159-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar). Moreover, CRE-binding sites have frequently been observed in testicular expressed genes implicated in spermatogenesis and fertility (8Weitzel J.M. Shiryaeva N.B. Middendorff R. Balvers M. Radtke C.

A. 1996; 93: 12262-12266Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), suggesting a critical role for CREMτ in proper regulation of these genes during spermatogenesis. Germ cell nuclear factor (also known as retinoid receptor-related testis-associated receptor) is a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors (18Cooney A.J.

Endocrinol. 2004; 216: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar); however, a ligand for GCNF is currently unknown. Target gene disruption of GCNF leads to embryonic lethality (20Chung A.C.

In vitro studies suggested that GCNF acts as a transcriptional repressor and may inhibit transcriptional activation mediated by other nuclear receptors (21Cooney A.J. Hummelke G.C. Herman T. Chen F. Jackson K.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 245: 94-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 22Yan Z. Jetten A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35077-35085Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). GCNF can specifically bind to direct repeats of nuclear receptor half-site (5′-AGGTCA-3′) with zero base pair spacing between the half-sites or to extended single half-sites (23Yan Z.H. Medvedev A.

The binding sites for GCNF have been described e.g. within the protamine gene promoters that are expressed from postmeiotic male germ cells (16Ha H. van Wijnen A.J. Hecht N.B. J. Cell. Biochem. 1997; 64: 94-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 23Yan Z.H. Medvedev A. Hirose T. Gotoh H. Jetten A.M. J. Biol.

In this study, we reported the identification and initial characterization of a testis-specific promoter of human mGPDH. mGPDH contributes to the aerobic metabolism of sperms powering its motility, which is required for fertilization. The testicular expression of mGPDH is regulated by a balanced activity between CREMτ and GCNF, which might be a general regulation mechanism for several postmeiotically expressed target genes implicated in sperm motility and fertility. Isolation and Characterization of DNA Sequences—A human promoter C fragment was amplified by PCR using primers hum1 (5′-ACTGTGTTGTATATAACTTCC-3′) and hum2 (5′-GAAGACAGAGAATAAAGTCC-3′) and human genomic DNA as template. The resulting 211-bp PCR fragments (corresponding to nucleotide positions 101880–102090; GenBank™ accession number AC092686) were gel-purified, ligated into pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Mannheim, Germany), and sequenced. This promoter fragment was further subcloned into pGL3-Basic (Promega) upstream of the luciferase gene, generating the construct hu(-106/+105)-Luc. Human promoter C sequence from -57 to -38 (5′-CCTTTGTGAGGTCATGAATG-3′, see Fig. 1) was designed as double-stranded oligonucleotides and ligated upstream of the minimal rat prolactin promoter (from -38 to +36) into pGL3-Basic (26Gellersen B. Kempf R. Telgman R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), generating the construct CREwt-rPRL-Luc. A mutant variant of this construct was similarly designed using oligonucleotides containing the sequence 5′-CCTTTGTCTGGAGATGAATG-3′ (the italic residues indicated the mutated one compared with wild type), resulting in the construct CREmut-rPRL-Luc. To characterize the 5′ end of human testicular mGPDH mRNA, we used a rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) technique, which allows only amplification from full-length transcripts with an intact 5′-cap structure (GeneRacer, Invitrogen) as described previously (8Weitzel J.M. Shiryaeva N.B. Middendorff R. Balvers M. Radtke C. Ivell R. Seitz H.J. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). RNA was isolated from testis tissue of two patients aged older than 50 years who were undergoing orchiectomy as the primary treatment of prostatic carcinoma. RNA was reverse-transcribed with the mGPDH-specific primer WL274 (5′-CAGATATCTCACACCACCATGG-3′). The 5′ end amplification was performed with the GeneRacer 5′ primer and the mGPDH-specific primer WL273 (5′-TGAGCTTCTCTGGAAGGAGG-3′) using the PCR setup and cycling parameters suggested by the supplier's protocol. These first amplification products were subjected to a nested PCR using GeneRacer 5′-nested primer and the gene-specific nested primer WL301 (5′-ACAGTTGCAAGAGCACCTCC-3′). The amplification products were gel-purified, ligated into pGEM-T Easy, and sequenced. mRNA Expression Analysis—Multiple human tissue Northern blots were obtained from Clontech (Heidelberg, Germany). A human mGPDH cDNA probe was prepared with [α-32P]dCTP by random prime labeling (Roche Applied Science). Prehybridization, hybridization, and washing were performed under high stringency conditions according to the manufacturer's instructions. To control for the relative amount of RNA in each lane, after hybridization with mGPDH cDNA, the blots were stripped by boiling in 0.1% SDS for 1 min and reprobed with a human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA. Quantitative “real-time” PCR was conducted using the LC-DNA Master SYBR Green kit in a LightCycler (Roche Applied Science) as described previously (27Weitzel J.M. Radtke C. Seitz H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 5148-5155Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Testicular RNA was prepared as described above and reverse-transcribed with a mixture of random hexamer and oligo(dT) primers (Amersham Biosciences). Exon 1-specific PCR reactions (4Weitzel J.M. Grott S. Radtke C. Kutz S. Seitz H.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) were performed using the common human mGPDH-specific reverse primer WL273 and the following human exon 1-specific forward primers: exon 1a, WL285 (5′-GAGTAGGAGAAGCCAGATCC-3′); exon 1b, WL304 (5′-GCCGAGGCTCTGATTCTGG-3′); and exon 1c, WL192 (5′-ATCAGTCACAACACTCATATCC-3′). Rat mGPDH-specific primers were as described previously (4Weitzel J.M. Grott S. Radtke C. Kutz S. Seitz H.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The crossing points of target gene amplification products were normalized to the crossing points of the “housekeeping” gene ubiquitin using the standard adjustments recommended by the supplier as described previously (27Weitzel J.M. Radtke C. Seitz H.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 5148-5155Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—In vitro translated CREMτ, C-terminally fused with the FLAG epitope (26Gellersen B. Kempf R. Telgman R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and GCNF, N-terminally fused with the hemagglutinin (HA) epitope (28Schmitz T.P. Susens U. Borgmeyer U. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1446: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), were synthesized by a transcription/translation-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. 1 μl of in vitro translated CREMτ or GCNF was incubated with 10 fmol of radioactively labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe hu(-62/-32) (5′-GGTATCCTTTGTGAGGTCAACAATGACATTA-3′) in the presence of 1 μg of poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT) as described previously (8Weitzel J.M. Shiryaeva N.B. Middendorff R. Balvers M. Radtke C. Ivell R. Seitz H.J. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). For competition experiments, a 100-fold molar excess of double-stranded oligonucleotides wild-type hu(-62/-32), mutated hu(-62/-32) (5′-GGTATCCTTTGTCTGGAGAACAATGACATTA-3′) (the italic residues indicated the mutated one compared with wild type), or wild-type hu(-106/+105) was added to the binding reaction. For supershift experiments, 1 μl of rabbit polyclonal anti-CREM (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), mouse monoclonal anti-HA (Cell Signaling Technology, Frankfurt am Main, Germany), or mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2) (Sigma) antibodies were added to the binding reaction mixtures and preincubated for 30 or 60 min at room temperature. The shifted DNA bands were separated on 5% polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography on Kodak X-Omat AR films (Eastman Kodak Co.). Transient Transfection Assay—Human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells were cultured under standard conditions in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium plus Glutamax (Invitrogen) and 10% fetal calf serum as described previously (4Weitzel J.M. Grott S. Radtke C. Kutz S. Seitz H.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 7Weitzel J.M. Kutz S. Radtke C. Grott S. Seitz H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4095-4103Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Transient transfection experiments were performed using a modified calcium phosphate technique. For each 9.6-cm2 dish, 1.4 μg of the promoter containing pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter plasmid (for constructs, see above) was mixed with 0.8 μg of CREM and 0.8, 1.6, or 2.4 μg of GCNF expression plasmids or the corresponding amount of unspecific salmon sperm DNA in 250 mm CaCl2. This solution was mixed with the same volume of 280 mm NaCl, 3 mm Na2HPO4, and 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, and incubated for 30 min. 230 μl of the DNA/calcium phosphate mixture was added drop by drop to the culture medium containing ∼7 × 105 cells/well, and the cells were harvested after an 18-h incubation. Expression plasmids were as follows: CREMτ; CREM-10/FLAG and CREMα; CREM-22/FLAG in pRc/cytomegalovirus (all gifts of Birgit Gellersen) (26Gellersen B. Kempf R. Telgman R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 97-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); and GCNF in pCMX (a gift of Uwe Borgmeyer) (24Susens U. Aguiluz J.B. Evans R.M. Borgmeyer U. Dev. Neurosci. 1997; 19: 410-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Luciferase activities were determined as described previously (4Weitzel J.M. Grott S. Radtke C. Kutz S. Seitz H.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 7Weitzel J.M. Kutz S. Radtke C. Grott S. Seitz H.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 4095-4103Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and normalized to the total protein concentration of the samples, which were determined by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad). Luciferase assays were carried out in duplicate, and each construct was tested in at least five independent transfections with three culture dishes/experiment ± S.D. Significant values were estimated by Student's t test. Immunohistochemistry—Immunohistochemistry experiments of human testis tissue using an anti-mGPDH-specific antibody (directed against amino acids 42–206 of mGPDH) were performed as described previously (8Weitzel J.M. Shiryaeva N.B. Middendorff R. Balvers M. Radtke C. Ivell R. Seitz H.J. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Partial testes tissues were obtained from fertile patients aged from 20 to 40 years with intact spermatogenesis who were investigated to exclude a testicular tumor. For immunohistological analysis of mGPDH in spermatozoa, sperm suspensions were centrifuged (649 × g, 1 min), the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was fixed by the administration of 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (136 mm NaCl, 50 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) followed by application to BD Falcon culture slides. After sedimentation (40 min, 4 °C), the supernatant was discarded and chambers were washed with PBS followed by drying of spermatozoa at 36 °C to improve adhesion. Subsequently, chambers were washed with PBS again and incubated with 2% normal swine serum (DAKO, Hamburg, Germany) in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 30 min. Normal swine serum was replaced by primary antibody solution (0.2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% NaN3, 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS) containing rabbit polyclonal anti-mGPDH (1:600). Spermatozoa were incubated with the primary antibody at 4 °C overnight followed by three washing cycles with PBS. Secondary antibody (anti-rabbit IgG (Alexa 488 nm) (1:1000), Molecular Probes, Lexington, KY) was administered in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 60 min in a dark chamber. Slides were washed with PBS three times and covered for fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss Axioskop, filter set 09, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). For negative controls, the primary antibody was omitted or preimmune serum (1:600) was used instead of the antibody. Identification of Human mGPDH Promoter C—To test the hypothesis that human mGPDH might be regulated by a testis-specific promoter, we performed a BLAST search using the rat promoter C sequence (GenBank™ accession number AJ495842) as query sequence against the entire GenBank™ data base entries. We were able to detect a human sequence with a sequence identity of 87% (see Fig. 1). A detailed inspection located this sequence 36.9 kb downstream of exon 1b and 2.3 kb upstream of exon 2 within the human mGPDH gene on chromosome 2q24.1 (GenBank™ accession number AC092686), suggesting a human orthologous sequence of promoter C. The usage of promoter C in rat correlates with an alternative transcript variant, which contains the sequence of the non-translated exon 1c at its 5′ end (3Gong D.W. Bi S. Weintraub B.D. Reitman M. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 4Weitzel J.M. Grott S. Radtke C. Kutz S. Seitz H.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 381: 611-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To verify that exon 1c-containing transcripts are also detectable from human testicular RNA, we amplified the 5′ ends of mGPDH transcripts by RACE-PCR. Indeed, we successfully amplified exon 1c-containing transcripts from human testicular RNA. Because this RACE-PCR technique amplifies only those cDNA molecules, which have been generated from full-length transcripts (see “Experimental Procedures”), we simultaneously mapped the major transcriptional start site (Fig. 1, designated as +1, boldface arrow) and identified four additional alternate start sites (Fig. 1, fine arrows) of these transcripts. Northern blot analysis from rodent RNA detected a short mGPDH transcript of ∼2.4 kb solely in testis, whereas most somatic tissues contain a longer transcript of ∼6.5 kb (3Gong D.W. Bi S. Weintraub B.D. Reitman M. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 29Koza R.A. Kozak U.C. Brown L.J. Leiter E.H. MacDonald M.J. Kozak L.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 30Ferrer J. Aoki M. Behn P. Nestorowicz A. Riggs A. Permutt M.A. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 262-266Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether this testis-specific transcript might also be detectable from human tissues, we performed Northern blot analysis from 23 human tissue samples. As shown in Fig. 2A,a short transcript of ∼2.4 kb was solely detectable from testicular RNA. For quantification of the concentration of exon 1b- and exon 1c-containing transcripts in human and rat testes, we conducted a quantitative real-time PCR assay. As shown in Fig. 2B, exon 1c-containing transcripts were 2.6-fold as much expressed as exon 1b-containing transcripts in human, whereas exon 1c-containing transcripts were 23-fold higher expressed than exon 1b-containing transcripts in rat. This correlates well with the ratio of 6.5 to 2.4 kb transcript in human (Fig. 2A), rat, and mouse testes (3Gong D.W. Bi S. Weintraub B.D. Reitman M. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 29Koza R.A. Kozak U.C. Brown L.J. Leiter E.H. MacDonald M.J. Kozak L.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and may also correlate with the different spermatogenesis efficiencies in rodents and man. Transient Transfection Experiments—To examine the regulation of human mGPDH promoter C in testis, we introduced a sequence of the promoter from -106 to +105 into a luciferase reporter construct (hu(-106/+105)-luc). This sequence portion includes the highly conserved region between rat and human (Fig. 1) and has previously been identified to be the important sequence for promoter C activity in rat (8Weitzel J.M. Shiryaeva N.B. Middendorff R. Balvers M. Radtke C. Ivell R. Seitz H.J. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). After transfection of the construct hu(-106/+105)-luc into HepG2 cells, the promoter activity was barely detectable. In contrast, additional cotransfection of the transcriptional activator CREMτ increased the hu(-106/+105)-Luc activity 9-fold above background level (Fig. 3A). This activation was completely blocked after additional cotransfection with increasing amounts of the transcriptional repressor GCNF (Fig. 3A). Because sequence inspections identified a putative CRE site from -51 to -44 (Fig. 1), we introduced a sequence portion from -57 to -38 into a reporter plasmid upstream of the minimal rat prolactin promoter, generating the heterologous promoter construct CREwt-rPRL-Luc. As shown in Fig. 3B, the induction of CREwt-rPRL-Luc after cotransfection of CREMτ into HepG2 cells was well preserved within this region. Cotransfection of CREMα (lacking the activator domain of CREMτ) had no significant influence on the promoter activity. Furthermore, the activation of CREMτ depended on the presence of an intact CRE site because mutation of this site (CRE-mut-rPRL-Luc) prevented activation (Fig. 3B). The CRE site contains the sequence 5′-TGAGGTCA-3′ (Fig. 1, -51/-44), thus differing from the sequence of a typical CRE site (5′-TGACGTCA-3′) by one nucleotide. Interestingly, this nucleotide exchange generates a putative nuclear receptor (NR)-binding half-site 5′-AGGTCA-3′ (Fig. 1, -49/-44). To test that this site might be a functional binding site for nuclear receptors, we cotransfected the testis-specific transcriptional repressor GCNF together with the reporter construct CREwt-rPRL-Luc and CREMτ into HepG2 cells. As shown in Fig. 3B, GCNF was able to relieve the CREMτ-mediated activation of CREwt-rPRL-Luc, suggesting an interference of CREMτ and GCNF signal pathways. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—We next tested whether an in vitro translated FLAG-tagged CREMτ is able to bind to the CRE/NR site. Incubation of CREMτ with a radioactively labeled DNA fragment containing the CRE/NR site (-62/-32) generated slower migrating bands in electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments (Fig. 4A, arrows). These CREM·DNA complexes were abolished by the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled wild-type CRE/NR fragment but not by the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled mutated CRE/NR site-containing fragment. Incubation with an anti-CREM antibody abolished the formation of the CREMτ·DNA complexes, whereas an anti-FLAG antibody supershifted this complex to lower mobility (Fig. 4A, arrowhead). To evaluate that this DNA element is also able to bind to the nuclear receptor GCNF, we incubated the same CRE/NR site-containing DNA fragment (-62/-32) with an in vitro translated HA-tagged GCNF. As shown in Fig. 4B, GCNF binds to the CRE/NR site, which includes the putative nuclear receptor half-site (Fig. 4B, arrow). The GCNF·DNA complex was abolished by the addition of a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled CRE/NR wild-type fragment or an excess of fragment -106/+105 but not by addition of a 100-fold molar excess of CRE/NR-mutated fragment, which simultaneously mutated the nuclear receptor half-site. After incubation with an anti-HA antibody, the GCNF·DNA complex was supershifted to lower mobility (Fig. 4B, arrowhead). Thus, CREMτ and GCNF compete for binding to the same DNA element in which a CRE site overlaps with a NR-binding site. Immunohistochemistry—To analyze the cellular localization of mGPDH within human testicular tissue, we incubated human testicular cross-sections with an anti-mGPDH-specific antibody. As shown in Fig. 5A, arrow, we observed an mGPDH immunostaining during spermatid differentiation of postmeiotic germ cells. Spermatid-specific staining was absent when preimmune serum was used instead of the antibody (Fig. 5B). To further investigate the localization of mGPDH within mature spermatozoa, we incubated spermatozoa with the anti-mGPDH antibody. As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, arrows, the midpiece of spermatozoa showed a strong immunoreactivity. Using the preimmune serum, the midpiece of spermatozoa remained unstained (Fig. 6, C and D, arrows), whereas no immunostaining was observed by omitting the first antibody incubation (Fig. 6E). A Testis-specific Promoter of Human mGPDH—Several lines of evidence suggested that human mGPDH is, beside the two somatic promoters A and B, additionally regulated by a third testis-specific promoter C. First, a RACE-PCR amplification approach amplified mGPDH transcripts with the sequence of exon 1c directly adjacent to exon 2, solely from testicular RNA. The expression of these transcripts is regulated by promoter C, which is located upstream of exon 1c of the mGPDH gene (Fig. 1). Second, the usage of promoter C in rat correlates with a shortened transcript length of ∼2.4 kb (3Gong D.W. Bi S. Weintraub B.D. Reitman M. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 29Koza R.A. Kozak U.C. Brown L.J. Leiter E.H. MacDonald M.J. Kozak L.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Among 23 human tissues, an mGPDH transcript of ∼2.4 kb was solely detected from testis tissue, suggesting a very similar expression and splicing regulation in human testicular tissue (Fig. 2A). Third, an alignment of the rat promoter C sequence with human genomic sequences identified a 48-bp human sequence portion, which shows an 87% sequence identity (Fig. 1). This sequence is located downstream of exon 1b and upstream of exon 2 sequences of the human mGPDH gene at roughly the same position compared with the rat orthologous mGPDH gene (3Gong D.W. Bi S. Weintraub B.D. Reitman M. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The expression of mGPDH is high in those tissues with a high ATP turnover rate (3Gong D.W. Bi S. Weintraub B.D. Reitman M. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 301-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 29Koza R.A. Kozak U.C. Brown L.J. Leiter E.H. MacDonald M.J. Kozak L.P. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1996; 336: 97-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), suggesting an important role of mGPDH for appropriate energy production of these cells. Furthermore, human mGPDH was localized to late spermatids and to the mitochondria-rich midpiece of spermatozoa (Figs. 5 and 6) and, moreover, mGPDH knock-out mice showed a reduced fertility (10Brown L.J. Koza R.A. Everett C. Reitman M.L. Marshall L. Fahien L.A. Kozak L.P. MacDonald M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32892-32898Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Thus, a tight regulation of the testis-specific promoter may responsible for proper fertility, both in man and mice. In this context, the dysfunction of mGPDH may result in reduced motility of spermatozoa and/or alterations of appropriate spermatid development. Further investigation of mGPDH knock-out mice should address these questions. Regulation of the Testis-specific Promoter by CREMτ and GCNF—A sequence inspection of the testis-specific promoter of human mGPDH identified the sequence 5′-TGAGGTCA-3′ at position -51 to -44 (Fig. 1). This sequence differs from a typical CRE consensus sequence (5′-TGACGTCA-3′) by one nucleotide, thus generating a nuclear receptor-binding site (5′-AGGTCA-3′ at -49 to -44). Interestingly, both the testis-specific transcriptional activator CREMτ (Fig. 4A) and the testis-specific transcriptional repressor GCNF (Fig. 4B) bind to this sequence motif in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. Cell experiments demonstrated that CREMτ is able to activate a promoter C-containing reporter construct. This activation capacity is preserved within the CRE/NR motif as indicated by introducing this response element into a heterologous reporter construct. Moreover, the CREMτ-mediated activation is relieved after additional cotransfection of GCNF (Fig. 3, A and B). Down-regulation of CREMτ-mediated Activation by GCNF— Interestingly, the expression of rat mGPDH has been detected in postmeiotic germ cells restricted from round spermatid (step 2) up to early elongating spermatid (step 11) in a temporal expression peak (8Weitzel J.M.

Since CREMτ protein is highly detectable in round spermatids (31Delmas V. van der Hoorn F. Mellstrom B. Jegou B. Sassone-Corsi P. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 1502-1514Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), it may serve as a critical regulator for mGPDH up-regulation in round spermatids. GCNF expression reached maximal levels in stage VI–VIII spermatids (32Katz D. Niederberger C. Slaughter G.R. Cooney A.J. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 4364-4372Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 33Zhang Y.L. Akmal K.M. Tsuruta J.K. Shang Q. Hirose T. Jetten A.M. Kim K.H. O'Brien D.A. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1998; 50: 93-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and GCNF protein was detected at least until spermatids began to elongate (34Yang G. Zhang Y.L. Buchold G.M. Jetten A.M. O'Brien D.A. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 1620-1630Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 35Lan Z.J. Gu P. Xu X. Cooney A.J. Biol. Reprod. 2003; 68: 282-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that CREMτ may be responsible for mGPDH up-regulation in round spermatids, whereas GCNF is responsible for down-regulation during elongating spermatid development. However, other regulation mechanisms such as posttranslational modifications (36San Agustin J.T. Witman G.B. Biol. Reprod. 2001; 65: 151-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) or competing for transcriptional cofactors (22Yan Z. Jetten A.M. J. Biol.

Nature. 1999; 398: 165-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) may contribute to appropriate regulation of mGPDH. Furthermore, an identical CRE/NR sequence motif, 5′-TGAGGTCA-3′, has also been described within the testis-specific promoter of the angiotensin-converting enzyme. This site has been located from -55 to -48 relative to the transcriptional start site and has been shown to be a binding site for CREMτ (17Zhou Y. Sun Z. Means A.R. Sassone-Corsi P. Bernstein K.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12262-12266Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). A small portion of the angiotensin-converting enzyme promoter from -91 to +17 can efficiently target a reporter construct to step 4–14 spermatids (38Howard T. Balogh R. Overbeek P. Bernstein K.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 18-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 39Sibony M. Segretain D. Gasc J.M. Biol. Reprod. 1994; 50: 1015-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, mGPDH and the testis-specific promoter of the angiotensin-converting enzyme have been shown to have the same critical response element and both proteins show similar temporal expression peaks during spermatid development. This expression pattern may be regulated by competing of the transcriptional activator CREMτ with the transcriptional repressor GCNF to the same binding site. Further investigations of CREMτ- and GCNF-regulated target genes should clarify whether this counteractive regulation might be a general regulation mechanism during spermatid development. We are indebted to Birgit Gellersen and Uwe Borgmeyer for the gifts of plasmid DNA and helpful comments on the paper."

We are attempting to identify and characterize the molecular mechanisms controlling the erythroid-specific expression of the α-spectrin gene. Previously, we demonstrated that the core promoter of the human α-spectrin gene directed low levels of erythroid-specific expression only in the early stages of erythroid differentiation. We have now identified a region 3′ of the core promoter that contains a DNase I hypersensitive site and directs high level, erythroid-specific expression in reporter gene/transfection assays. In vitro DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays identified two functional GATA-1 sites in this region. Both GATA-1 sites were required for full activity, suggesting that elements binding to each site interact in a combinatorial manner. This region did not demonstrate enhancer activity in any orientation or position relative to either the α-spectrin core promoter or the thymidine kinase promoter in reporter gene assays. In vivo studies using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated hyperacetylation of this region and occupancy by GATA-1 and CBP (cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein). These results demonstrate that a region 3′ of the α-spectrin core promoter contains a GATA-1-dependent positive regulatory element that is required in its proper genomic orientation. This is an excellent candidate region for mutations associated with decreased α-spectrin gene expression in patients with hereditary spherocytosis and hereditary pyropoikilocytosis. α-Spectrin is a membrane protein critical for the flexibility and stability of the erythrocyte.

Spectrin, the most abundant protein of the erythrocyte membrane skeleton, exists in the erythrocyte as a heterodimer of two homologous proteins, α-spectrin and β-spectrin (1Winkelmann J.C.

Structural abnormalities of α spectrin in the region of the αβ self-association site are the most common defects associated with hereditary elliptocytosis and hereditary pyropoikilocytosis. However, in many patients with α-spectrin-linked hereditary spherocytosis and hereditary pyropoikilocytosis, the precise genetic defect(s) is unknown. Studies suggest that these patients have a defect in α-spectrin mRNA accumulation, which has been termed a “thalassemia-like” defect (20Hanspal M. Hanspal J.S. Sahr K.E. Fibach E. Nachman J. Palek J.

The identification and characterization of the regulatory elements that control α-spectrin gene expression has important implications for understanding the pathogenesis of α-spectrin-linked hemolytic anemia and erythrocyte membrane protein biosynthesis and assembly. In splenic erythroblasts isolated from mice early after Friend virus infection, there is marked synthesis of spectrin with a significant excess of α-spectrin over β-spectrin (22Hanspal M. Hanspal J.S. Kalraiya R. Liu S.C. Sahr K.E. Howard D. Palek J. Blood. 1992; 80: 530-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies in avian and rat cells have shown that the increased α-spectrin synthesis in early erythropoiesis is controlled at the transcriptional level (23Peters L.L. White R.A. Birkenmeier C.S.

However, the molecular mechanisms that regulate the erythroid tissue-specific or developmental stage-specific expression of α-spectrin, including the mechanisms that control the increase in α-spectrin gene transcription to high levels during the early stages of erythropoiesis, are unknown. Our previous studies demonstrated that the core promoter of the human α-spectrin gene directed very low levels of erythroid-specific expression only in the early stages of erythroid development, indicating that elements outside the core α-spectrin gene promoter are required for high level erythroid expression (26Boulanger L.

This report describes the identification and characterization of a region 3′ of the core α-spectrin gene promoter that contains a DNase I hypersensitive site and directs high level, erythroid-specific expression in transient and stable reporter gene/transfection assays. This region contains two functional GATA-1 sites, both required for full activity. In transfection assays this region did not display characteristics of a classical enhancer. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated hyperacetylation of this region and occupancy of GATA-1 and CBP. 1The abbreviations used are: CBP, cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB)-binding protein; ChIP, quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation. These results demonstrate that a region 3′ of the α-spectrin promoter positioned in its proper genomic orientation is required for high level, erythroid-specific, α-spectrin gene expression. This is an excellent candidate region for mutations associated with decreased α-spectrin gene expression in patients with hereditary spherocytosis and hereditary pyropoikilocytosis. DNase I Hypersensitive Site Mapping—DNase I hypersensitive site mapping was performed as described with minor modifications (27Nemeth M.J. Bodine D.M. Garrett L.J. Lowrey C.H. Blood Cells Mol.

The nuclei were pelleted by gentle centrifugation and resuspended in ∼1.5 ml of ice-cold RSB. 200 μl of nuclei were placed in tubes containing increasing amounts of DNase I (0–4.0 μg/ml) in a volume of 30 μl. After a 37 °C incubation for 10 min, 230 μl of stop buffer (1% SDS, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 600 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 500 μg/ml proteinase K) was added. The DNA was digested at 37 °C overnight before extraction with phenol, phenol/CHCl3, and CHCl3 followed by ethanol precipitation. DNA was digested with HindIII for Southern blot analysis using a 600-bp PstI/BglII fragment containing the α-spectrin core promoter as a probe. For fine mapping the migration of the band generated by DNase I and HindIII digestion was compared with the migration of bands generated by the digestion of high molecular weight K562 DNA digested with HindIII and either PstI, PvuII, EcoRI, MfeI, NheI, or EcoRV.

Reaction mixes contained K562 cell nuclear extracts, 10,000 cpm of labeled probe, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC). After digestion with DNase I, samples were electrophoresed in 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gels, and the gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography.

After formaldehyde fixation, chromatin was fragmented by sonication 10 times for 10 s each. Extracts were precleared with protein G-Sepharose, antibody was added, and incubated was overnight at 4 °C. After elution and extraction, immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (iCycler, Bio-Rad). PCR primers A and D (Table I) amplify the 183-bp 5′-untranslated region. Samples from at least three independent immunoprecipitations were analyzed. SYBR green fluorescence in 25-μl PCR reactions was determined, and the amount of product was determined relative to a standard curve generated from a titration of input chromatin. Amplification of a single amplification product was confirmed by dissociation curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining. Parallel controls for each experiment included samples of no chromatin, no antibody, nonimmune rabbit IgG, and rabbit nonimmune serum. Identification of a DNase I Hypersensitive Site Downstream from the Core α-Spectrin Gene Promoter—The human α-spectrin gene is >120 kilobases and is encoded by 52 exons. This large size makes a systematic search for regulatory elements difficult by functional assays. To identify important nonpromoter-related regulatory sequences, we examined the DNase I hypersensitivity of the α-spectrin gene in the 5′ and 3′ regions as well in the first few introns using K562 cell nuclei. A hypersensitive site was identified in a 3-kilobase HindIII fragment that mapped 3′ of the core α-spectrin gene promoter (Fig. 1A). Fine mapping localized this hypersensitive site to a ∼183-bp region 3′ of a PvuII site (Fig. 1, B and C). As a positive control, the same preparation of K562 DNA was digested with varying concentrations of DNase I followed by digestion with EcoRI and hybridization to a human BamHI/PvuII Gγ-globin probe as described (35Groudine M. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Gelinas R. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Papayannopoulou T. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7551-7555Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). A hypersensitive site in the Gγ-globin promoter generated a new band at 1.5 kilobases, as previously shown by Groudine et al. (35Groudine M. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Gelinas R. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Papayannopoulou T. Proc. Natl. Acad. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7551-7555Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) using K562 cell nuclei (not shown). Digestion of the same preparation of K562 DNA with varying concentrations of DNase I followed by digestion with SacI and hybridization to a human keratin 14 probe (36Sinha S. Degenstein L. Copenhaver C. Fuchs E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 2543-2555Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) demonstrated that the DNase I hypersensitivity of the α-spectrin gene and the Gγ-globin gene is not the result of general DNase I digestion of the DNA (not shown). When DNase I hypersensitivity experiments were performed with nuclei from the nonerythroid cells SH SY5Y (neuroblastoma) and Jurkat (T lymphocyte) and the same α-spectrin probe, no DNase I sensitivity was observed (not shown). The Region Corresponding to the Hypersensitive Site Contains Binding Sites for GATA-1- and AP-1-binding Proteins—We inspected the DNA sequence of the region corresponding to the DNase I hypersensitive site. Consensus binding sequences for GATA-1 (two sites) and AP1 binding proteins (one site), both important for expression in other erythroid genes, were identified (Fig. 1D). This 183-bp region encodes an untranslated exon (exon 1′, 61 bp) and an alternately spliced, untranslated intron (intron 1′, 122 bp) (32Sahr K.E. Tobe T. Scarpa A. Laughinghouse K. Marchesi S.L.

Addition of the 183-bp Region to an α-Spectrin Gene Promoter Fragment Significantly Increases Promoter Expression in Erythroid Cells—The 183-bp region was placed immediately 3′ of the α-spectrin gene promoter in its proper genomic orientation upstream of a luciferase reporter gene. This plasmid, p794/183 (Fig. 2A), was transiently transfected into K562 cells. The relative luciferase activity was determined 48 h after transfection and compared with the activity obtained with the core α-spectrin promoter plasmid (p794 (26Boulanger L. Sabatino D.E. Wong E.Y. Cline A.P. Garrett L.J. Garbarz M. Dhermy D. Bodine D.M. Gallagher P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41563-41570Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)), a negative control promoterless luciferase plasmid (pGL2B), and a positive control with the luciferase reporter gene under control of the SV40 early promoter (pGL2P). As shown in Fig. 2, the α-spectrin gene promoter + downstream sequence plasmid, p794/183, directed 10-fold high level expression of the luciferase reporter gene in erythroid cells than the promoter alone. The addition of the 183-bp region to deletion mutants of the core α-spectrin gene promoter directed significantly higher levels of expression than the corresponding promoter fragment alone (Fig. 2A). These sequences even conferred activity to a minimal α-spectrin gene promoter fragment, p44/183, which is inactive in the absence of this element. The α-Spectrin Gene Promoter Requires Both Exon 1′ and Intron 1′ for Full Expression in Erythroid Cells—To determine the relative importance of exon 1′ and intron 1′ in increasing expression directed by the α-spectrin gene promoter, luciferase promoter reporter plasmids with exon 1′, intron 1′, and exon 1′ + intron 1′ in forward (genomic) and reverse orientations were transfected into K562 and HeLa cells. In K562 cells, plasmids with exon 1′ + intron 1′ in reverse orientation (p794/183Rev) directed low levels of expression at levels comparable with those directed by the promoter alone (p794, p = not significant, unpaired t test) or the promoter + exon 1′ (p794/Exon, p = not significant, unpaired t test) (Fig. 2B). Promoter + intron 1′ plasmids (p794/Intron) directed higher levels of expression, approximately half that directed by p794/183 (p = 0.0046, unpaired t test). In HeLa cells there was no change in levels of luciferase expression of any of the plasmids. These results suggest that exon 1′ and intron 1′ in their appropriate genomic orientation are required for full expression in erythroid cells. The 183-bp Region of the α-Spectrin Gene Contains Binding Sites for GATA-1- and AP-1-binding Proteins—To identify sites for DNA-binding proteins within the 183-bp region, DNase I footprinting analysis with nuclear extracts from K562 cells was performed. Two footprints were observed. One site was in exon 1′ on the sense strand (5′-AAGATAA-3′) (Fig. 3A), and the other was in intron 1′ on the antisense strand (5′-AGATAAA-3′) (Fig. 3B). Both contained consensus binding sequences for the erythroid transcription factor GATA-1. The footprinted region in intron 1′ did not extend into the AP-1 consensus sequence. GATA-1 Binds Both Exon 1′ and Intron 1′ GATA Sites in the 183-bp Region in Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—To determine which nuclear proteins bound to the GATA-1 sites present in exon 1′ and intron 1′, double-stranded oligonucleotides containing the corresponding α-spectrin promoter GATA-1 sequences (exon 1′ G + H; intron 1′, I + J; Table I) or control GATA-1 sequences (K + L; Table I) (37Mignotte V. Wall L. deBoer E. Grosveld F. Romeo P.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 37-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) were prepared and used in gel shift analyses. A single complex was observed in K562 (erythroid) extracts when probes corresponding to either site were used (Figs. 4, A and B). This complex migrated at the same location as a control oligonucleotide containing a GATA-1 consensus sequence. This species was effectively competed both by an excess of unlabeled homologous oligonucleotide and by an excess of unlabeled control GATA-1 oligonucleotide (not shown). The inclusion of GATA-1 antisera abolished most or all of the DNA binding. Mutation of the GATA-1 Sites in the 183-bp Region Disrupts GATA-1 Binding in Vitro—To further assess the ability of nuclear proteins to bind the α-spectrin GATA-1 sites in vitro, DNase I footprinting and gel mobility shift assays were performed using probes with the GATA-1 sites mutated (GATA to GTTA) (38Zon L.I. Youssoufian H. Mather C. Lodish H.F. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10638-10641Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). For in vitro DNase I footprinting, mutations were introduced into both exon 1′ and intron 1′ GATA-1 sites of the α-spectrin gene promoter + the 183-bp probe described above. When footprinting was performed with this double mutant GATA-1 probe and K562 cell nuclear extracts, no protected regions at the mutant GATA-1 sites were observed (Fig. 3C). When oligonucleotides with mutation of the consensus GATA-1 binding sequences (GATA to GTTA) (38Zon L.I. Youssoufian H. Mather C. Lodish H.F. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10638-10641Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar) were used in gel mobility shift assays, complex formation was nearly or completely abolished (Fig. 4, C and D). These data indicate that GATA-1 binds to the exon 1′ and intron 1′ sites 3′ of the α-spectrin gene promoter in vitro. Mutation of the 183-bp Region GATA-1 Sites Significantly Decreases Promoter Function—To assess the relative importance of these GATA-1 binding sites in promoter function, mutations were introduced into the GATA-1 sites protected in DNase I footprinting experiments, both individually and in combination. Mutation of the exon 1′ GATA-1 site (GATA to GTTA) (37Mignotte V. Wall L. deBoer E. Grosveld F. Romeo P.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 37-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) decreased activity by approximately half in transiently transfected K562 cells (Fig. 5). Mutation of the intron 1′ GATA-1 site in a similar manner (GATA to GTTA) reduced promoter activity by 66% (Fig. 5). When a reporter plasmid with mutations of both GATA-1 sites was transfected into K562 cells, promoter activity was reduced to background levels (Fig. 5). Variability is frequently observed at high levels of luciferase activity from transfection to transfection. As noted in Figs. 2, A and B, 5, and 7A, this is observed in comparison of the α-spectrin promoter alone compared with the α-spectrin promoter with the downstream element, where relative ratios of luciferase activity range from 1:6 to 1:14.Fig. 7Effect of position and orientation of the 183-bp region 3′ with the α-spectrin gene promoter or a heterologous gene promoter in erythroid cells in transient transfection assays.

Most resting B cells do not express Bright; however, it is induced after stimulation with antigen or polyclonal mitogens. Bright activation results in up-regulation of μ transcription; however, it is not clear whether Bright function is critical for normal B cell development. To begin to address Bright function during B cell development, seven mutated forms of Bright were produced. Five of the seven mutants revealed little or no DNA binding activity. Furthermore, because Bright binds DNA as a dimer, two of the mutants formed complexes with wild type Bright and acted in a dominant negative fashion. Dominant negative Bright prevented the up-regulation of μ transcription in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with wild type Bright. These data identify regions within Bright that are required for the DNA binding activity of Bright and for its function as a transcription factor.

The transcription factor Bright (or B cell regulator of IgH transcription) is a B cell-specific protein that was first discovered in a mature mouse B cell line, BCg3R1-d, as a mobility-shifted protein complex that caused 3–6-fold increases in μ heavy chain mRNA levels in response to stimulation with a T-dependent antigen and interleukin-5 (1Webb C.F.

Bright binds to A+T-rich regions of the intronic heavy chain enhancer that have been identified as matrix association regions and regions 5′ of some VH promoters, including the V1 S107 family gene (3Webb C.F.

The cDNA for Bright was isolated in 1995, and the protein was shown to interact with DNA as a multimeric complex that includes multiple copies of Bright (4Herrscher R.F. Kaplan M.H. Lelsz D.L. Das C.

Science. 1993; 261: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). Initial evidence indicated that the Bright DNA-binding complex was supershifted by antibodies that reacted with several different domains of Btk (5Webb C.F. Yamashita Y. Ayers N. Evetts S. Paulin Y. Conley M.E. Smith E.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6956-6965Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Bright co-precipitated with Btk from wild type, activated splenic B cells, but Btk and Bright did not co-precipitate from xid B cells despite both proteins being present. These data suggested that Bright and Btk are functionally linked. However, the role of Bright in normal B cell development is unknown. Expression of Bright in both mouse and human tissues is tightly regulated at the level of transcription (8Webb C.F. Smith E.A. Medina K.L. Buchanan K.L. Smithson G. Dou S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4747-4754PubMed Google Scholar, 9Nixon J.C. Rajaiya J.B. Ayers N. Evetts S. Webb C.F. Cell. Immunol. 2004; 228: 42-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In the mouse, Bright mRNA was detected in all embryonic tissues, but became B-lymphocyte restricted in the adult. Bright mRNA is apparent at the pre-B and activated germinal center stages of B cell differentiation (8Webb C.F. Smith E.A. Medina K.L. Buchanan K.L. Smithson G. Dou S. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 4747-4754PubMed Google Scholar). The human Bright homologue (10Kortschak R.D. Reimann H. Zimmer M. Eyre H.J. Saint R. Jenne D.E. Genomics. 1998; 51: 288-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) shows a similar expression pattern in the adult where mRNA expression is primarily limited to B lymphocytes of the pro-B cell, germinal center centroblasts, and mature recirculating subpopulations (9Nixon J.C. Rajaiya J.B. Ayers N. Evetts S. Webb C.F. Cell. Immunol. 2004; 228: 42-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, in both the adult mouse and human, Bright expression is predominantly B cell-specific. Bright belongs to a growing family of proteins that bind DNA through an A+T-rich interacting domain (ARID) (11Wilsker D. Patsialou A. Dallas P.B. Moran E. Cell Growth & Differ. 2002; 13: 95-106PubMed Google Scholar). ARID-containing proteins are highly conserved throughout evolution where many of them play important roles as developmental regulators (11Wilsker D. Patsialou A. Dallas P.B. Moran E. Cell Growth & Differ. 2002; 13: 95-106PubMed Google Scholar). ARID-containing proteins occur in all eukaryotic organisms and include 13 sequences in the human data base (11Wilsker D. Patsialou A. Dallas P.B. Moran E. Cell Growth & Differ. 2002; 13: 95-106PubMed Google Scholar, 12Venter J.C. Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (10387) Google Scholar). Bright is the only member of the ARID family for which gene target sequences have been identified. One of the best characterized members of this family is the Dri (Drosophila homologue Dead Ringer) gene, first identified in 1996 (13Gregory S.L. Kortschak R.D. Kalionis B. Saint R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 792-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The ARID region of Dri is essential for anterior-posterior patterning and for muscle development in the fly embryo (14Shandala T. Takizawa K. Saint R. Development. 2003; 130: 1505-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 15Shandala T. Kortschak R.D. Gregory S. Saint R. Development. 1999; 126: 4341-4349Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Shandala T. Kortschak R.D. Saint R. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 46: 423-430PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the ARID region of Dri has been solved and revealed a unit of eight α-helices with a short two-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet (17Iwahara J. Clubb R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6084-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). NMR analysis predicted that helices 5 and 6 together with the intervening loop would contact DNA within the major groove (18Iwahara J. Iwahara M. Daughdrill G.W. Ford J. Clubb R.T. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 1197-1209Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Because of the greater than 90% homology of Bright and Dri within the ARID region (19Webb C. Zong R.-T. Lin D. Wang Z. Kaplan M. Paulin Y. Smith E. Probst L. Bryant J. Goldstein A. Scheuermann R. Tucker P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1999; LXIV: 109-118Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the crystal structures may be quite similar. The crystal structure of Dri suggests regions of Bright that interact with DNA. To learn how Bright regulation of the μ heavy chain is important for B cell development, we sought to produce mutations in Bright that were predicted to interfere with its function. Three important functions of Bright were targeted for our studies: DNA binding activity, protein interaction, and nuclear localization. Several point mutations made within the ARID domain dramatically lowered DNA binding activity. Two of those mutations resulted in dominant negative forms of Bright. Dominant negative mutants of other proteins have been used in other systems to investigate the roles of proteins involved in multimeric complexes. Specifically, transcription factors have been targets for this method of study, which can give insight into both the DNA binding activity and the subsequent expression of target genes (20de Vries A. Flores E.R. Miranda B. Hsieh H.M. van Oostrom C.T. Sage J. Jacks T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 2948-2953Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Dominant negative Bright protein reduced μ heavy chain transcription in transfected CHO cells by 85%. These data confirm and extend predicted functional roles for several of the Bright protein domains. Cell Lines and Transfections—Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 7% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 5 × 10-5m 2-mercaptoethanol, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate. The M12g3Ri and BCg3R-1d cell lines, transfected derivatives of the murine B cell lines M12.4 and BCL1B1, respectively, contained coding sequences for a T15 idiotype immunoglobulin (1Webb C.F. Das C. Coffman R.L. Tucker P.W. J. Immunol. 1989; 143: 3934-3939PubMed Google Scholar) and were maintained in RPMI 1640 with the same supplements. CHO cells were transfected using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's directions. M12g3Ri cells were transfected by electroporation at 0.24 kV with a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad). Transfected cells were maintained in complete RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal calf serum. In some cases, the cells were stimulated for 48 h with 10 mg/ml LPS (Sigma) to induce endogenous Bright expression after transfection. Transfected cells were enriched by sorting for GFP expression using an advanced MoFlo cell sorter (Cytomation, Inc., Fort Collins, CO) at the Flow Cytometry, Cell Sorting, and Confocal Microscopy Laboratory, Oklahoma Center for Molecular Medicine, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center and the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation Flow Cytometry Core facilities. Typical sorting experiments yielded cells >90% enriched for GFP expression. Column Chromatography—Nuclear extracts from CHO cells transfected with the full-length Bright expression plasmid (4Herrscher R.F. Kaplan M.H. Lelsz D.L. Das C. Scheuermann R. Tucker P.W. Genes.

The column was calibrated before and after use with Bio-Rad gel filtration standards to ensure maintenance of column integrity. 100-μl fractions were collected and subjected to Western blotting for Bright as previously described (5Webb C.F.

Mutant Construction and Expression Vectors—A full-length mouse Bright cDNA clone in the pBKCMV (4Herrscher R.F. Kaplan M.H. Lelsz D.L. Das C. Scheuermann R. Tucker P.W. Genes. Dev. 1995; 9: 3067-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar) was used as a template to introduce single amino acid changes or small deletions in the Bright coding sequence through site-directed mutagenesis with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). The PCR conditions used were: 95 °C for 40 s followed by 17 cycles of 95 °C for 40 s, 60 °C for 1 min, and 68 °C for 16 min with an additional 20 min at 68 °C to complete the reaction. The mutations produced were: GCG to GCC, at amino acid position 286 (P286A); TGG to GCG, W299A; TTC to GCA, F317A; TAT to GCA, Y330A; REKLES at amino acids 455–460 was changed to AEALEA; and the nucleotides encoding the amino acids IKK at positions 402–404 were deleted. A double mutant (DP) was also generated that contained both the W299A and Y330A mutations. All of the sequences were verified using the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation sequencing facility and Vector NTI software. Wild type and mutant Bright were tagged on the carboxyl terminus with the myc-His sequence using the vector pcDNA4/TO/myc-His B (Invitrogen). Briefly, Bright was PCR-amplified with oligonucleotides that added a 5′ EcoRI site and a 3′ XbaI site while deleting the endogenous stop codon and was ligated into the EcoRI- and XbaI-digested vector fragment. Sequences were further subcloned into the MiGR1 retroviral vector, allowing GFP expression from an internal ribosomal entry site to allow visualization of cells expressing Bright (21Pear W.S. Miller J.P. Xu L. Pui J.C. Soffer B. Quackenbush R.C. Pendergast A.M. Bronson R. Aster J.C. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Blood. 1998; 92: 3780-3792Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A μ heavy chain expression vector containing the V1 S107 family sequence from -574 to +146 of the coding sequence and including the previously described Bright binding sites and a 1-kb XbaI fragment including the complete intronic heavy chain enhancer sequence (2Webb C.F. Das C. Eaton S. Calame K. Tucker P.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5197-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) was used as a reporter construct. Other plasmids used were GFP-Btk (5Webb C.F.

Immunol. 2000; 165: 6956-6965Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), a MiGR1 vector containing the Bright sequence in the reverse orientation and pUC19. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays (EMSAs)—The nuclear extracts were prepared by hypotonic lysis with the protease inhibitors phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (5 × 10-5m), leupeptin (1 × 10-2 mg/ml), and aprotinin (5 × 10-3 mg/ml), as previously described (22Buchanan K.L. Hodgetts S.E. Byrnes J. Webb C.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4270-4277PubMed Google Scholar), and the protein concentrations were determined using Bradford reagent (BioRad). The proteins were incubated with a γ-32P-labeled DNA probe at 37 °C for 15 min, and the EMSAs were performed in 4% nondenaturing acrylamide gels, as previously described (2Webb C.F. Das C. Eaton S. Calame K. Tucker P.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5197-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). The DNA probe was a 150-bp BamHI-FokI fragment from the S107 V1 5′-flanking sequence (bf150) (2Webb C.F. Das C. Eaton S. Calame K. Tucker P.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5197-5205Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) containing the prototypic Bright binding site. For supershift assays, antibodies and proteins were preincubated 5 min prior to probe addition. The antibodies used were: polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse Bright (gift of P. Tucker, University of Texas, Austin, TX), mouse monoclonal IgG1 anti-myc (Invitrogen), polyclonal rabbit anti-CDP/Cux (gift of E. Neufeld, Yale University, New Haven, CT), and preimmune serum. Confocal Microscopy and Flow Cytometry—The cells were harvested and washed in phosphate-buffered saline with 3% fetal calf serum. After fixation in 1% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at 37 °C, the cells were stained with polyclonal affinity purified goat anti-peptide mouse Bright against the peptide ALHGSVLEGAGHAE from the amino-terminal domain of Bright. Preimmune sera were collected prior to immunization, and IgG was isolated as a negative control. Incubation with primary antibody was followed by rabbit anti-goat IgG-Alexa568 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 15 min each on ice. 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (Molecular Probes) was added to the cells for 2 min prior to the final washes to distinguish nuclear from cytoplasm staining. A Zeiss LSM510 confocal microscope was used for analysis. Sections of ∼50 μm were taken and analyzed using Zeiss LSM Image Browser software (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) with the aid of the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation Imaging Core Facility. Western Blotting and Immunoprecipitation—In vitro translated proteins were produced with TnT rabbit reticulocyte lysates (Promega, Madison, WI). The protein samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under standard denaturing conditions through a 7.5% acrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes as previously described (5Webb C.F. Yamashita Y. Ayers N. Evetts S. Paulin Y. Conley M.E. Smith E.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 6956-6965Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Bright was detected with rabbit anti-Bright, and Btk was detected with goat anti-Btk (C-20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) followed by alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG or rabbit anti-goat IgG (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL), respectively. The blots were developed with alkaline phosphatase substrate (Bio-Rad). Preimmune goat sera or mouse anti-Sp1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as isotype-matched controls. The proteins were immunoprecipitated with protein A/G Plus-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) after incubation with antibody in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 for 1.25 h at room temperature with slow rotation. Bead complexes were washed extensively with 0.1 m Tris, 0.5 m NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 before suspension in SDS sample buffer. The samples were heated for 5 min at 95 °C and centrifuged briefly, and the supernatants were analyzed by Western blotting. Real Time and Reverse Transcriptase-PCR—RNA was isolated using TriReagent according to manufacturer's protocol (MRC, Cincinnati, OH), treated with DNase (2 units) (Ambion, Austin, TX) for 30 min at 37 °C, subjected to phenol-chloroform extraction, and used to generate cDNA with the SuperScript II RNase H reverse transcriptase kit (Invitrogen). Immunoglobulin transcription was measured by real time quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) with 250 nm of specific primers and 5 pmol of TaqMan probe designed using the PrimerExpress software (Applied Biosystems) and obtained from Applied Biosystems or Integrated DNA Technologies (Washington, D.C.). TaqMan rodent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase control reagents (Applied Biosystems) were used to ensure cDNA integrity. Expression of the V1 reporter construct was measured using the following primers and probe: forward, 5′-TGTCCTGAGTTCCCCAATGG-3′; reverse, 5′-AAACCCAGTTTAACCACATCTTCAT-3′; and probe, 5′-CACATTCAGAAATCAGCACTCAGTCCTTGTCA-3′. The amplified products were examined by ethidium gel electrophoresis, and the sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing by the Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation sequencing core. Amplification reactions (25 μl) were performed in triplicate in 96-well plates under the following conditions: 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, and 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, and 55 °C for 1 min and analyzed with the ABI Prism 7700 SDS (PE Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). V1 transcript expression was quantified from the average of triplicate samples using a standard curve derived from a V1 containing plasmid. Samples without reverse transcriptase were also analyzed to ensure that the amplified products did not result from the transduced vector DNA. Calculations for V1 expression were performed according to the equation 2-ΔΔCT as suggested by the manufacturer. For example, ΔCT is the change in cycle threshold between V1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression, ΔΔCT = ΔCT,q - ΔCT,cb where ΔCT,q is the value obtained for the DP vector and ΔCT,cb is the value for the empty vector control. Creation of Bright Mutants—Bright has been subdivided into five protein domains according to predictions from amino acid homology and analysis of deletion mutants (4Herrscher R.F. Kaplan M.H. Lelsz D.L. Das C. Scheuermann R. Tucker P.W. Genes. Dev. 1995; 9: 3067-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The domains are depicted in Fig. 1 and include an acidic amino terminus of unknown function, the ARID domain predicted to be important for DNA binding activity, a putative activation domain containing a consensus nuclear localization sequence, a protein-protein interaction domain with a helix-turn-helix structure (23Suzuki M. Okuyama S. Okamoto S. Shirasuna K. Nakajima T. Hachiya T. Nojima H. Sekiya S. Oda K. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 853-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and a short carboxyl terminus. Deletions of the acidic and carboxyl-terminal domains did not affect DNA binding or transcription activity of Bright (4Herrscher R.F. Kaplan M.H. Lelsz D.L. Das C. Scheuermann R. Tucker P.W. Genes. Dev. 1995; 9: 3067-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to create amino acid changes hypothesized to affect the DNA binding function of Bright. Specifically, four large, bulky amino acids within the ARID domain predicted to be involved in DNA interactions (17Iwahara J. Clubb R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6084-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) were independently mutated to alanine (Fig. 1). Two of these mutations were introduced simultaneously to create a fifth mutant called DP for double mutant. In addition, the putative nuclear localization sequence KIKK was altered by deleting the last three amino acids of that sequence K(–-) (Fig. 1). Finally, because several ARID family members, including Bright, exhibit extended regions of amino acid homology within the putative protein interaction domain (4Herrscher R.F. Kaplan M.H. Lelsz D.L. Das C. Scheuermann R. Tucker P.W. Genes. Dev. 1995; 9: 3067-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 17Iwahara J. Clubb R.T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6084-6094Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), mutations were also made in the protein interaction domain to change amino acids in the sequence REKLES to the sequence AEALEA. Mutations in the ARID Domain Decrease DNA Binding Activity—All of the Bright mutants were expressed in an in vitro transcription and translation system and assessed by Western blotting for equivalent levels of protein expression (Fig. 2A). The expressed proteins were assayed for DNA binding activity by EMSA analysis (Fig. 2B). We found that wild type Bright successfully bound DNA (first lane). Mutations of Bright within the REKLES protein interaction domain (sixth lane) or deletion of the putative nuclear localization signal (eighth lane) did not alter DNA binding. However, each of the four point mutations within the DNA-binding domain reduced Bright DNA binding activity. Thus, like the Drosophila homologue, Dri, specific residues within the ARID domain are essential for DNA binding. Intracellular Localization of Bright—Endogenous Bright exists in both the cytoplasm and nucleus in B lymphocytes where it associates with nuclear matrix proteins (24Kaplan M.H. Zong R.T. Herrscher R.F. Scheuermann R.H. Tucker P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 21325-21330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To determine whether mutant Bright proteins exhibited altered intracellular localization, CHO cells were transfected with a construct that co-express GFP and His-Myc-tagged Bright proteins. Transfected cells were identified by GFP expression, and Bright was identified using an anti-Bright antibody and a secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa-568 (Fig. 3). The stained cells were viewed by confocal microscopy. Comparisons of cells transfected with wild type Bright or with mutant Bright containing the ARID mutations showed similar staining patterns with Bright protein most abundant in the nucleus. This observation indicates that mutation of the ARID domain does not adversely affect the ability of Bright to translocate to the nucleus. In contrast, the Bright location in cells expressing the K(–-) mutant showed higher levels of cytoplasmic staining than was observed with either the wild type or ARID mutants. However, these cells also exhibited Bright staining within nuclear regions. Therefore, sequences other than the KIKK consensus may also contribute to the nuclear localization of Bright. Nevertheless, the mutant proteins largely behaved as predicted from the structure of Dri. Bright Exists as a Dimer and Can Form Heteromeric Complexes with Mutant Proteins—Previous data indicated that Bright bound DNA as a tetramer (4Herrscher R.F. Kaplan M.H. Lelsz D.L. Das C. Scheuermann R. Tucker P.W. Genes. Dev. 1995; 9: 3067-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). To determine whether tetrameric complexes exist in the absence of DNA, nuclear extracts were subjected to size exclusion chromatography, and the fractions were analyzed for the presence of Bright by immunoblot. No differences were observed between extracts from B cell lines and the transfected CHO cells. Proteins from CHO cells transfected with a Bright expression construct showed that Bright eluted in fractions corresponding to precisely 2-fold its molecular weight and trailed into fractions consistent with its 70-kDa size (Fig. 4a). Native Bright complexes from the B cell line BCg3R-1d also migrated similarly in these experiments (not shown). These data are consistent with Bright dimer formation. Bright did not elute from such columns in fractions that were consistent with the existence of Bright tetramers. To determine whether the mutated proteins formed heterodimers with wild type Bright, His-Myc-tagged mutant forms of Bright were co-expressed in CHO cells with native wild type Bright. Tagged proteins were distinguished from native Bright by slight size differences in Western blots (Fig. 4b) and were confirmed using anti-tag antibodies (not shown). Anti-Myc antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate the tagged proteins, and blots were developed with anti-Bright (Fig. 4b). In every case, a lower molecular weight band was detected that reflected the presence of native Bright. The presence of the His-Myc tag did not interfere with dimer formation. These data show that anti-tag reagents that specifically reacted with the Bright mutants also immunoprecipitated co-expressed native Bright. Therefore, these data confirm that Bright exists as dimers. The data also show that the ARID and KIKK (K(–-)) mutations do not alter the ability of Bright to self-associate. ARID/Wild Type Heterodimers Show Altered DNA Binding Activity—The ARID mutants failed to bind DNA in Fig. 3. Because the mutant proteins can dimerize with wild type Bright, we wished to test whether such heterodimers also failed to bind DNA. Therefore, proteins from whole cell extracts of CHO cells co-transfected with native, untagged, and mutant Bright were analyzed by EMSA. Proteins from CHO cells transfected with only the ARID carboxyl-terminal Myc-His-tagged mutants, failed to bind DNA (Fig. 5a). The DNA binding profiles are similar to those previously shown for the corresponding in vitro translated proteins in Fig. 3. Although the W299A mutant alone did not bind DNA (Fig. 5b), it did not efficiently inhibit the DNA binding activity of the native protein because extracts from cells expressing W299A with native Bright retained efficient DNA binding. On the other hand, the Y330A and DP mutants inhibited the majority of Bright DNA binding activity in this experiment. Further experiments showed no difference between the DP and Y330A mutants (not shown). These data show that dimers containing W299A mutant Bright can bind DNA, whereas dimers containing the Y330A mutation do not bind DNA efficiently. Because both the Y330A and wild type Bright were expressed at equivalent levels in these experiments (Fig. 5a, lower panel), the data show that dimers containing Y330A act in a dominant negative fashion and inhibit Bright DNA binding activity. Dominant Negative Bright Mutants Fail to Activate Immunoglobulin Transcription—The data in Figs. 4 and 5 indicate that the Bright mutants are capable of forming heterodimers with native Bright and that they can interfere with DNA binding activity in EMSAs. We tested the ability of such dimers to function as dominant negative proteins by examining their ability to inhibit transcription induction by"
https://openalex.org/W2074078860,"Development of a vaccine against H. pylori is regarded as desirable alternative to the current antibiotic therapy regimens. Mice immunized with an attenuated recombinant Salmonella typhimurium expressing H. pylori urease subunits A&B have dramatically reduced bacterial loads after a single dose. The mechanism(s) of protection against this largely extra-cellular pathogen are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to identify genes that were regulated specifically in response to immunization, in order to gain a broader picture of the immune response in the immunized gastric epithelium. Gene expression in RNA isolated from the gastric mucosa of immunized and infected Balb/c mice was compared with that in infected only mice at 1, 3, and 14 days after challenge with a mouse-adapted strain of H. pylori. We show that infection with H. pylori causes an immediate reaction in vivo, which was clearly divided into acute and chronic phases, and further that the transcriptional response in the H. pylori infected and immunized gastric mucosa is unique. Analysis of gene expression patterns at day 14 post-infection suggested not only the beginning of a lymphocytic infiltrate, but of an integrated epithelial response characterized by increased expression of genes controlling cell cycle and turnover. This observation was confirmed in independent experiments. The global approach has brought new insights to the effect of immunization on the gastric epithelium and has led us to propose a new multi-factorial model for the mechanisms underlying vaccine-induced protection."
https://openalex.org/W2091390839,"CBTF122 is a subunit of the Xenopus CCAAT box transcription factor complex and a member of a family of double-stranded RNA-binding proteins that function in both transcriptional and post-transcriptional control. Here we identify a region of CBTF122 containing the double-stranded RNA-binding domains that is capable of binding either RNA or DNA. We show that these domains bind A-form DNA in preference to B-form DNA and that the -59 to -31 region of the GATA-2 promoter (an in vivo target of CCAAT box transcription factor) adopts a partial A-form structure. Mutations in the RNA-binding domains that inhibit RNA binding also affect DNA binding in vitro. In addition, these mutations alter the ability of CBTF122 fusions with engrailed transcription repressor and VP16 transcription activator domains to regulate transcription of the GATA-2 gene in vivo. These data support the hypothesis that the double-stranded RNA-binding domains of this family of proteins are important for their DNA binding both in vitro and in vivo.

The 122-kDa subunit of the Xenopus CCAAT box transcription factor CBTF122 (also known as 4F and ubp4) belongs to a family of double-stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD) 1The abbreviations used are: dsRBD, double-stranded RNA-binding domain; ds, double-stranded; ss, single-stranded; CBTF, CCAAT box transcription factor; ODC, ornithine decarboxylase; mRBD, mutant RBD; GST, glutathione S-transferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay. containing proteins implicated in a variety of cellular processes. CBTF122 and its splice variant CBTF98 have been identified as subunits of CBTF, a transcription factor that activates the GATA-2 gene both in oocytes and zygotically at the start of gastrulation (1Brewer A.C. Guille M.J. Fear D.J. Partington G.A. Patient R.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 2Orford R.L. Robinson C. Haydon J. Patient R.K. Guille M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5557-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Homologues of CBTF122 have been identified mainly through their affinity for RNA and include NF90 (also known as DRBP76 and NFAR1), NF110, TCP80, ILF3 and MPP4 in humans (3Reichman T. Muniz L. Mathews M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 342-356Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar), SPNR and ILF3 in mice (4Buaas F.W. Lee K. Edelhoff S. Disteche C. Braun R.E. Mamm. Genome. 1999; 10: 451-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and p74 and ILF3 in rats (5Coolidge C.J. Patton J.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 1407-1417Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). It is now clear that many of the human homologues arise from alternative splicing of transcripts from the ILF3 locus (6Duchange N. Pidoux J. Camus E. Sauvaget D. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 261: 345-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 7Saunders L.R. Jurecic V. Barber G.N. Genomics. 2001; 71: 256-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The functions assigned to these related proteins include the regulation of both transcription and mRNA stability. For example, the transcript levels of more than 90 genes, most of which are known to be regulated by type I interferons, were altered by expression of NF90, suggesting that NF90 has a role in mediating the antiviral response (8Krasnoselskaya-Riz I. Spruill A. Chen Y.W. Schuster D. Teslovich T. Baker C. Kumar A. Stephan D.A. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 2002; 18: 591-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). However, it is unclear whether these changes are a result of transcriptional or post-transcriptional mechanisms. By contrast, specific regulation of interleukin-2 levels by NF90 is clearly dependent upon its stabilization of interleukin-2 mRNA (9Shim J. Lim H. J R.Y. Karin M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 1331-1344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In transcriptional terms, the human homologues of CBTF98 and CBTF122, NF90 and NF110, have been shown to be capable of both transcription activation and repression depending upon at which promoter they are acting (3Reichman T. Muniz L. Mathews M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 342-356Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 10Reichman T.W. Mathews M.B. RNA. 2003; 9: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Deletion analysis showed that transcription activation required the nuclear localization signal and two dsRBDs (3Reichman T. Muniz L. Mathews M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 342-356Crossref Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Mutations within the dsRBDs that abrogated RNA binding also inhibited transcription activation (10Reichman T.W. Mathews M.B. RNA. 2003; 9: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). During Xenopus development, CBTF122 has been shown to be critical for activation of GATA-2 transcription both by in vitro (2Orford R.L. Robinson C. Haydon J. Patient R.K. Guille M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5557-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and in vivo methods. 2G. P. Scarlett, A. M. Noble, C. Robinson, E. Mantouvalou, A. W. Thorne, and M. J. Guille, manuscript in preparation. GATA-2 is a transcription factor necessary for correct hematopoietic, neural, and urogenital development in mice (11Tsai F.Y. Keller G. Kuo F.C. Weiss M. Chen J. Rosenblatt M. Alt F.W. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1994; 371: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1195) Google Scholar, 12Zhou Y. Lim K.C. Onodera K. Takahashi S. Ohta J. Minegishi N. Tsai F.Y. Orkin S.H. Yamamoto M. Engel J.D. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 6689-6700Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) and is also implicated in the formation of ventral mesoderm in Xenopus (13Sykes T.G. Rodaway A.R.F. Walmsley M.E. Patient R.K. Development. 1998; 125: 4595-4605PubMed Google Scholar). Although CBTF is maternal, it does not activate GATA-2 transcription in embryos until the start of gastrulation and this is, at least in part, due to regulation of its nuclear translocation. CBTF is present in the oocyte nucleus where GATA-2 is initially transcribed. However, after oocyte maturation, CBTF activity is cytoplasmic and relocates to the nucleus only at the gastrula stage when zygotic GATA-2 transcription commences (1Brewer A.C. Guille M.J. Fear D.J. Partington G.A. Patient R.K. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 757-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). CBTF122 is anchored in the cytoplasm by RNA binding (14Brzostowski J. Robinson C. Orford R. Elgar S. Scarlett G. Peterkin T. Malartre M. Kneale G. Wormington M. Guille M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3683-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), and its movement from the cytoplasm to the nucleus is synchronous with the mass degradation of maternal RNA at the mid-blastula transition, suggesting a mechanism for the developmental stage-specific control of CBTF activity based on RNA binding. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of CBTF122 indicates a number of conserved domains (see Fig. 1a). The N-terminal domain is predicted to contain ZFR type zinc fingers (15Meagher M.J. Schumacher J.M. Lee K. Holdcraft R.W. Edelhoff S. Disteche C. Braun R.E. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 228: 197-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). CBTF122 also contains two dsRNA-binding domains (dsRBDs) of the type found in Staufen and Xlrbpa (16St Johnston D. Brown N.H. Gall J.G. Jantsch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10979-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 17Burd C.G. Dreyfuss G. Science. 1994; 265: 615-621Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar). C-terminal to this is an arginine-glycine-rich region (RGG domain), similar to those found in hnRNP A and U1, which are implicated in nucleic acid binding (18Cobianchi F. Karpel R.L. Williams K.R. Notario V. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1063-1071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). There is also a poly-Q region that has been suggested to be involved in transcriptional activation in the context of other proteins (20Liberati C. di Silvio A. Ottolenghi S. Mantovani R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1441-1455Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Finally, there is a nuclear localization signal located N-terminal to the dsRBDs (14Brzostowski J. Robinson C. Orford R. Elgar S. Scarlett G. Peterkin T. Malartre M. Kneale G. Wormington M. Guille M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3683-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 21Bass B.L. Hurst S.R. Singer J.D. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 301-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) with a bipartite arrangement similar to the nuclear localization signal of nucleoplasmin (22Robbins J. Dilworth S.M. Laskey R.A. Dingwall C. Cell. 1991; 64: 615-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1249) Google Scholar). The RNA binding activity of CBTF122 and NF90, as well as of other dsRBD-containing proteins, has been well characterized. A CBTF122-maltose-binding protein fusion binds to dsRNA and A-form DNA-RNA hybrids without detectable sequence specificity (21Bass B.L. Hurst S.R. Singer J.D. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 301-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The NMR structure of the Staufen dsRBD has been solved (23Bycroft M. Grunert S. Murzin A.G. Procter M. St Johnston D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4385-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), as has the crystal structure of the Xlrbpa dsRBD complexed with dsRNA (24Ryter J.M. Schultz S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7505-7513Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). Saturation mutagenesis studies on the dsRBD of Xlrbpa demonstrated that the substitution of a conserved central Phe residue by Ala in both Staufen and Xlrbpa dsRBDs leads to abolition of RNA binding activity (23Bycroft M. Grunert S. Murzin A.G. Procter M. St Johnston D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4385-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 25Krovat B.C. Jantsch M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28112-28119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Reference to the published structure of the dsRBD-RNA complex demonstrates that this residue is important in stabilizing a lysine side chain that makes important backbone contacts adjacent to the major groove (24Ryter J.M. Schultz S.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 7505-7513Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). It is this mutation that we have previously used to inactivate the dsRBDs of CBTF122 (14Brzostowski J. Robinson C. Orford R. Elgar S. Scarlett G. Peterkin T. Malartre M. Kneale G. Wormington M. Guille M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3683-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The human orthologue of CBTF122 has been shown to require intact RNA-binding domains for transcription regulation but on promoters that are not known to be its in vivo targets (10Reichman T.W. Mathews M.B. RNA. 2003; 9: 543-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether an intact RBD was similarly required for transcription regulation at the GATA-2 promoter in Xenopus, a well characterized in vivo target of CBTF122. Embryo Manipulation and Western Blotting—The embryos were obtained as described by Smith and Slack (26Smith J.C. Slack J.M.W. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1983; 78: 299-317PubMed Google Scholar) and staged according to Nieuwkoop and Faber (27Nieuwkoop P.D. Faber J. Normal Table of Xenopus laevis, Daudin. Garland Publishing Inc., New York and London1967Google Scholar). In vitro transcription and microinjection of mRNA was carried out as described previously (28Guille M. Mol. Methods Dev. Biol. 1999; 127: 111-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 29Moore W.M. Guille M.J. Mol. Methods Dev. Biol. 1999; 127: 99-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Injections were carried out at the 8-cell stage with 4 nl of RNA solution (37 pg of RNA total). One embryo equivalent of freon extracted whole embryo lysate was assayed for CBTF122 fusion expression by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (30Robinson C. Guille M. Mol. Methods Dev. Biol. 1999; 127: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) using CBTF122 antibody (provided by B. Bass). Analysis of mRNA Levels by Real Time Reverse Transcriptase-PCR— cDNA was synthesized from RNA extracted from dissected explants of injected embryos cultured until stage 11 using the method of Steinbach and Rupp (31Steinbach O.C. Rupp R.A.W. Mol. Methods Dev. Biol. 1999; 127: 41-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). RNA expression was assayed as cDNA by PCR conducted on an ABI 7900HT sequence detection system using TAQMAN fluorescently labeled probes. The data were analyzed using the ΔΔCt method (ABI) using ODC as a control gene and uninjected marginal zones as control tissue. The probe and primer sequences are available by request. Protein Expression and Purification—The RBD and RBD+RGG regions of CBTF122 as well as the mutant RBD (mRBD) region were subcloned into pGex2T (Amersham Biosciences). The GST fusion proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified by glutathione-Sepharose and DNA-cellulose column chromatography as previously described (14Brzostowski J. Robinson C. Orford R. Elgar S. Scarlett G. Peterkin T. Malartre M. Kneale G. Wormington M. Guille M. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3683-3693Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The purified proteins were assayed and quantified by SDS-PAGE and UV spectroscopy using the calculated extinction coefficient of each protein. Embryo extract containing the multi-subunit CBTF complex was prepared as described previously (2Orford R.L. Robinson C. Haydon J. Patient R.K. Guille M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5557-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays of Recombinant CBTF122 and Endogenous CBTF—Either RNA (Cruachem) or DNA (Invitrogen) oligonucleotides were annealed to form duplexes and end-labeled by T4 polynucleotide kinase (New England Biolabs) using [α-32P]ATP (32Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 5.60-5.70Google Scholar). The proteins were incubated with the appropriate nucleic acid probe for 15 min on ice in EMSA buffer (2Orford R.L. Robinson C. Haydon J. Patient R.K. Guille M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5557-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) with the addition of 500 ng of poly(dI-dC) in the case of embryo extract, prior to separation of DNA-protein complexes on a 4% native polyacrylamide gel in 0.25× TBE. The gels were dried, and the free DNA and DNA-protein complexes were quantified using a phosphorimaging device (Molecular Dynamics). The Kd values were estimated from the protein concentration required to bind 50% of the DNA. Dimethyl Sulfate Interference Footprinting—Four picomoles of oligonucleotide were labeled at the 5′ end and annealed with the complementary sequence to form a double-stranded 55-mer probe. The probe was then gel-purified to remove residual single stranded oligonucleotide. The purified dsDNA was treated with 10% dimethyl sulfate (33Maxam A. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar), and the partially methylated probe was used in an EMSA. Separated species were transferred onto DE81 paper. After autoradiography the bound and free species were excised and eluted in 500 μl of buffer (1 m NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). 10 μg of tRNA was added, and the DNA was ethanol-precipitated. Piperidine cleavage and further treatment was performed as described by Maxam and Gilbert (33Maxam A. Gilbert W. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 499-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (9015) Google Scholar); DNA fragments were separated on a denaturing 16% polyacrylamide gel and visualized by autoradiography. Circular Dichroism—An Applied Photophysics π*-180 instrument was flushed with nitrogen gas for all CD experiments. Cell path lengths of 1, 2, 4, and 10 mm were used with sample concentrations of 15–60 μg/ml. All 29-bp duplexes were dissolved in 100 mm KF, 5 mm NaPO4 buffer, pH 7.6, at 22 °C. The concentrations were determined by UV measurements at 260 nm coupled with snake venom time course digestions to correct for hypochromic differences. The data were collected over the wavelength range 180–360 nm using adaptive sampling in conjunction with signal averaging in all cases. The instrument wavelength accuracy was ±0.1 nm, determined from the Xenon lines, and the CD was calibrated from camphor sulfonic acid at 290.5 nm. A-form DNA Predictive Methods—A-DNA propensity energy values for the duplex oligonucleotides were calculated using the method of Basham et al. (38Basham B. Schroth G.P. Ho P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6464-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The method was modified to determine the percentage of each duplex in either A- or B-form using the following classifications and rules. Class 1 is strong A or B formers are base pairs that have the same sign and whose sum is greater than 0.5. Class 2 is neutral A or B formers are base pairs that are of opposite sign and whose sum is zero. Class 3 is weak A or B formers are base pairs whose sum is less than 0.5 but not zero. Class 4 is base pairs unclassified by Basham et al. (38Basham B. Schroth G.P. Ho P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6464-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) because of lack of data. These are defined by their base composition as GC, CG or TA, AT. The following rules were applied to the above classifications: 1) all Class 1 base pairs remain as they are under all situations, conserved type; 2) if one or two consecutive class 2 or 3 are between two or more class 1 base pairs of the same type (A or B), then they both take on strong base pair type; 3) class 2 neutrals adjacent to class 1 base pairs take on that type if the base pair on the other side to the class 2 neutral is of class 2 or class 3; and 4) class 4 base pairs between class 1 base pairs of the same type can take on the same character as the class 1 type. The predictions shown (see Table III) show only the A and B percentage forms; there is 7% contribution that cannot be determined using the three base moving window model of Basham et al. (38Basham B. Schroth G.P. Ho P.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6464-6468Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), because these involve the ends of the molecule. Also, regions where no bias for each form can be determined add to the percentage of uncertainty.Table IIIOligonucleotides used in competition EMSA Double-stranded oligonucleotides were annealed and used in competition EMSA.

The percentages of each duplex predicted to be A- and B-form are also shown; this does not add to 100% because of the inability to calculate these data for the duplex ends and for certain sequences.NameDescriptionSequenceAPEPredictedP1-59 to -31GCGGAGGCTTGTGATTGGCTGGCCCGGGG-0.5158% A, 24% BCGCCTCCGAACACTAACCGACCGGGCCCCP2-56 to -50mtGCGTTTTAAAGTGATTGGCTGGCCCGGGG+0.4235% ACGCAAAATTTCACTAACCGACCGGGCCCC52% BP3-41 to -39mtGCGGAGGCTTGTGATTGGAATGCCCGGGG-0.269% A, 24% BCGCCTCCGAACACTAACCTTACGGGCCCCP4-44mtGCGGAGGCTTGTGATCGGCTGGCCCGGGG-0.4255% A, 26% BCGCCTCCGAACACTAGCCGACCGGGCCCCP5-49 and -55mtGCGGCGGCTTTTGATTGGCTGGCCCGGGG+0.1631% ACGCCGCCGAAAACTAACCGACCGGGCCCC48% BP6No CCAATGCGGAGGCTTGTGTATTTCTGGCCCGGGG-0.1341% A, 34% BCGCCTCCGAACACATAAAGACCGGGCCCCC1B-formCGCGAATTCGCGCGCAAATTTGCGGCCGG+0.3514% AGCGCTTAAGCGCGCGTTTAAACGCCGGCC73% BC2A-formGTGCGCACCCCGGCCGGGCCCCCGCGGGG-0.2962% A, 31% BCACGCGTGGGGCCGGCCCGGGGGCGCCCCC3(AT)14AATATATATATATATATATATATATATATA+0.530% ATATATATATATATATATATATATATATAT93% B Open table in a new tab Mutations in the dsRBDs of CBTF122EN Lead to a Loss of Transcriptional Regulation—The engrailed transcription repression domain (EN) when fused to a transcription activator leads to transcription repression of the target gene (34Jimenez G. Paroush Z. Ish-Horowicz D. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3072-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that the transcription inhibiting (CBTF122EN) fusion form of CBTF122 gives rise to a double axis phenotype (Fig. 1b, arrow) when expressed in Xenopus embryos. We confirmed that this effect was a result of changes at a transcriptional level and not a failure of CBTF122EN to be incorporated into the full CBTF complex, or an effect on mRNA turnover, by testing the strong transcription up-regulating CBTF122 form, CBTF122VP16. This protein gave the opposite, ventralized microcephalic phenotype when expressed in embryos dorsally (Fig. 1b, note the lack of eyes and head morphology), whereas CBTF122 expression alone gave rise to no obvious change in phenotype.2 Transcription activation by CBTF122 is regulated in part by its localization in the cytoplasm through anchoring to RNA. The mutation F435A/F559A in the dsRBDs leads to a loss of RNA binding. Such mutants localize early to the nucleus and thus arrive at their site of action earlier than native CBTF122 (2Orford R.L. Robinson C. Haydon J. Patient R.K. Guille M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5557-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). We investigated how this would affect transcriptional control by mutating the RBDs in the context of full-length CBTF122EN and CBTF122VP16 fusions. These fusion proteins (CBTF122mRBDEN and CBTF122mRBDVP16) were expressed in embryos by injection of in vitro transcribed mRNA alongside those injected with CBTF122EN and CBTF122VP16 mRNA. Although constructs with active dsRBDs resulted in the expected double axis and headless phenotypes, those containing a mutant form of the domains did not (Table I), suggesting a role for the dsRBDs in gene regulation.Table IAnalysis of phenotypes arising from CBTF122EN, CBTF122mRBDEN, CBTF122VP16, and CBTF122mRBDVP16 mRNA injection into Xenopus embryos The synthetic mRNAs (37 pg) were injected into the marginal zones of 8-cell X. laevis embryos, which were allowed to develop to stage 35. The embryos were scored blind for the formation of double axes or microcephaly.Injected RNANumber injectedDouble axisHeadless%%CBTF122EN21810CBTF122mRBDEN3800CBTF122VP1656018CBTF122mRBDVP166601Uninjected3000 Open table in a new tab We have shown CBTF122EN to be a powerful, specific repressor of transcription from the GATA-2 promoter.2 We therefore tested the ability of CBTF122mRBDEN to repress GATA-2 transcription in a Xenopus animal cap assay (35Green J. Mol. Methods Dev. Biol. 1999; 127: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In this assay, injection of CBTF122EN mRNA reduces GATA-2 mRNA levels by over 1000-fold, whereas injection of CBTF122mRBDEN mRNA reduces GATA-2 mRNA levels by only 10-fold (Table II). We confirmed by Western blotting of whole embryo extract using CBTF122 antibody that the two proteins were expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 1c). Thus a single point mutation in each of the dsRBDs is almost sufficient to abolish repression by CBTF122EN at the GATA-2 promoter. To understand how the RNA-binding mutations affected the ability of CBTF122 to act at the transcriptional level, we then analyzed how the binding of CBTF122 dsRBDs to nucleic acids was affected by these mutations in the dsRBDs in vitro.Table IIReverse transcriptase-PCR determination of GATA-2 mRNA levels following CBTF122EN or CBTF122mRBDEN mRNA injection into Xenopus embryos Two cell embryos were injected in the animal pole with 37 pg of synthetic RNA encoding either CBTF122EN or CBTF122mRBDEN. The embryos were allowed to develop to stage 8, and the animal caps were removed and cultured until sibling embryos reached stage 11. Relative amounts of GATA-2 mRNA were measured using real time reverse transcriptase-PCR. The data were analyzed by the ΔΔCt method (ABI), where Ct is the threshold cycle, and ΔΔCt is normalized for amount of input cDNA by comparison with the control gene (ODC) and levels relative to a calibrator sample (unijected embryos).Injected RNAThresholdΔCt (GATA2-ODC)ΔΔCt (injected – uninjected)2ΔΔCt (GATA2 fold change)GATA2ODCCBTF122EN37.4019.7417.6610.360.00076CBTF122mRBDEN29.6319.0310.603.300.1Uninjected26.8319.537.300.001 Open table in a new tab The dsRBD Domains of CBTF122 Bind Nucleic Acids Preferentially in the Order dsRNA > dsDNA > ssRNA—CBTF122 contains a single RGG domain of the type found in hnRNP A1 and U, which is implicated in single-stranded nucleic acid binding (18Cobianchi F. Karpel R.L. Williams K.R. Notario V. Wilson S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 1063-1071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Kiledjian M. Dreyfuss G. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar), and twin dsRBDs of the type found in Staufen and Xlrbpa (16St Johnston D. Brown N.H. Gall J.G. Jantsch M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10979-10983Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). To determine the contribution of these different domains to the interaction with nucleic acids, we expressed and purified CBTF122 fragments corresponding either to the dsRBD and RGG domains together, or the dsRBDs alone, as GST fusions (Fig. 1a). The predicted sizes of the expressed protein fragments were 41 and 28.5 kDa, respectively (CBTF122(41) and CBTF122(28.5)); both contained the nuclear localization signal. We purified these proteins to 95% homogeneity and then tested their ability to bind a dsRNA homologue of the -69 to -33 CCAAT box-containing region of the GATA-2 promoter by EMSA (Fig. 2a). The binding curves for CBTF122(41)GST and CBTF122(28.5)GST show that their affinities for RNA are comparable, with Kd values of ∼0.3 nm. Consequently the smaller 28.5-kDa fragment was chosen for subsequent EMSA studies. To estimate the relative affinity of the dsRBDs of CBTF122 for ssRNA, dsRNA, and dsDNA, data from EMSA experiments using CBTF122(28.5)GST were quantitated, and the percentage of bound probe was plotted as a function of protein concentration (Fig. 2b). The estimated binding constants show that the dsRBDs have the highest affinity for dsRNA, much lower affinity for dsDNA, and the lowest affinity for ssRNA with estimated Kd value s of 0.3, 6.0, and 30 nm, respectively. Previously a full-length CBTF122-maltose-binding protein fusion has been reported to have a Kd of 0.27 nm for dsRNA (21Bass B.L. Hurst S.R. Singer J.D. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 301-314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Therefore, our data suggest that dsRNA binding activity resides entirely within the region of the dsRBDs represented in the CBTF122(28.5)GST protein. Because this fragment bound to DNA, we then tested whether the RNA binding mutations that affected the ability of CBTF122EN to control GATA-2 transcription also affected DNA binding. Mutations in the dsRBDs Affect DNA Binding Activity—The previously described mutated protein CBTF122mRBD (2Orford R.L. Robinson C. Haydon J. Patient R.K. Guille M.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5557-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) contains two point mutations, F435A and F559A, known to be critical for RNA binding (23Bycroft M. Grunert S. Murzin A.G. Procter M. St Johnston D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4385-4391Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 36Ramos A. Grunert S. Adams J. Micklem D.R. Proctor M.R. Freund S. Bycroft M. St Johnston D. Varani G. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 997-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). However, it is possible that residues Phe435 and Phe559 are also important for the less understood DNA binding activity of this protein. We expressed and purified recombinant forms of both the native and mutant RNA-binding domains, again as GST fusions. These proteins (CBTF122(28.5)GST and CBTF122mRBD(28.5)GST) were tested for their ability to bind to either DNA or RNA homologues of the -59 to -31 GATA-2 promoter sequence. In agreement with our previous data (37, Elgar, S. J. (2001) Nucleic Acid Binding and Subcellular Localisation of CBTF122, . Ph.D. thesis, University of PortsmouthGoogle Scholar) the CBTF122mRBD(28.5)GST protein has a much reduced affinity for RNA duplex compared with CBTF122(28.5)GST (Fig. 3a). However, its DNA binding activity is also inhibited (Fig. 3b). Because these data show that dsRNA and dsDNA binding by CBTF122 involves at least some of the same critical amino acids, we investigated the interaction of CBTF122(28.5) with DNA further. The dsRBDs of CBTF122 Bind DNA in a Structure-dependent Manner—CBTF122 is known to bind dsRNA in a sequence-independent manner (21Bass B.L. Hurst S.R. Singer J.D. Curr.

MutY contains three structural domains: an iron-sulfur module, a six-helix barrel module with the helix-hairpin-helix motif, and a C-terminal domain. Here, we demonstrate that the mutant MutY(Δ26–134), which lacks the six-helix barrel domain, cannot complement the mutator phenotype of a mutY mutant in vivo. However, the mutant can still bind DNA and has weak catalytic activity at high enzyme concentrations. The mutant is a dimer in solution and assembled into two and multiple (up to five) complexes with 20- and 44-bp DNA fragments, respectively, in a concentration-dependent manner. Higher order complexes with DNA substrates containing A/GO mismatches were formed at lower protein concentrations than with the A/G mismatch and homoduplex DNA. Measurement of equilibrium binding using fluorescence anisotropy showed that the mutant protein retains some specificity for A/GO-containing DNA substrates and that the binding event is highly cooperative. This is consistent with the MutY structure determined, which indicates that GO specificity is contributed by both the six-helix barrel and C-terminal domains. The nonspecific binding of MutY(Δ26–134) to DNA suggests a model in which the specific binding of mismatched DNA by MutY involves sequential interactions, in which one MutY molecule scans the DNA and enhances binding of another MutY molecule to the A/GO mismatch.

The MutT protein eliminates 8-oxo-dGTP from the nucleotide pool with its pyrophosphohydrolase activity (5Maki H. Sekiguchi M.

The structure of MutY from Bacillus stearothermophilus in complex with A/GO-containing DNA was recently determined (25Fromme J.C. Banerjee A. Huang S.J. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2004; 427: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Similar to endonuclease III, AlkA, and OGG1 (21Bruner S.D. Norman D.P. Verdine G.L.

Verdine G.L. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3461-3471Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), MutY distorts the bound DNA and flips substrate bases out of the helix. All three domains of MutY wrap around the DNA substrate. The mismatched GO remains intrahelical and is sandwiched by the six-helix barrel and the C-terminal domains. One central issue concerning MutY function is how MutY searches for the mismatches within a vast excess of normal DNA in the genome. Although the MutY·DNA crystal structure offers some insight into the preferential recognition of GO and the binding event preceding catalysis (25Fromme J.C. Banerjee A. Huang S.J. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2004; 427: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar), the search mechanism remains unclear. To further investigate the substrate recognition of MutY on A/GO-containing DNA, we have constructed the mutant MutY(Δ26–134), without the six-helix barrel domain. The six-helix barrel module with the helix-hairpin-helix motif has been shown to directly contact the backbone of the GO strand and has substantial interaction with the C-terminal domain (25Fromme J.C. Banerjee A. Huang S.J. Verdine G.L. Nature. 2004; 427: 652-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This MutY deletion mutant has no in vivo activity. In solution, the mutant protein is a dimer, whereas intact MutY is a monomer as measured by both gel filtration and sedimentation velocity. To our surprise, the mutant binds to DNA and has very weak catalytic activity. Upon gel mobility shift assay, the mutant·DNA complex migrated slower than Y-DNA. The mutant protein could form two and multiple complexes with 20- and 44-bp DNA fragments, respectively, but higher order complexes with DNA substrates containing A/GO were formed at lower protein concentrations than with those containing A/G or homoduplex DNA. Measurement of equilibrium binding between the mutant protein and fluorescent DNA substrates by fluorescence anisotropy showed that the binding event is highly cooperative and that the specificity for A/GO mismatches is partially retained in the mutant. These data support a model in which MutY scans the DNA cooperatively as a dimer or a multimeric complex to locate base-base mismatches. Bacteria—E. coli strain GM7724 is a mutY knockout strain derived from AB1157 (ara14 argE3 Δ(gpt-proA)62 galK2 hisG4 kdgK51 leuB6 lacY1 mtl-1 rac-rfbD1 rpsL31 thr-1 tsx-33 supE44 xyl-5). The E. coli mutY gene was replaced with a chloramphenicol resistance gene (Cam) by Jen-Yen Wang in the laboratory of Dr. Michael Volkert and was moved into AB1157 by Dr. Martin G. Marinus. Strain CC104 containing a lacZ mutation at residue 461 of β-galactosidase and its derivative CC104mutM::mini-kan mutY::mini-Tn10 were from Dr. Jeffery H. Miller. DE3 lysogenic strains were constructed according to the procedures described by Invitrogen. Construction of the MutY(Δ26–134) Mutant—The mutant mutY gene was constructed by the PCR splicing overlap extension method (27Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). The first PCR with pMYW-1 (28Wright P.M. Yu J. Cillo J. Lu A-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29011-29018Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), which contains the mutY gene, as template and primers ChangYGSTF (5′-GCGCGCGGATCCATGCAAGCGTCGCAATTTTC-3′) and Chang376 (5′-TCGAGAATCGGTTGCCAGGGCAGAGTTTTTCGCCC-3′) generated PCR fragment 1, which contains the first 25 amino acid residues of MutY with an extension of 14 nucleotides covering residues 135–138. The second PCR with pMYW-1 as template and primers Chang377 (5′-TGCCCTGGCAACCGATTCTCGACGGTAACGTC-3′) and Chang349 (5′-GCCGGACTCGAGCTAAACCGGCGCGCCAGTGC-3′) generated PCR fragment 2, which contains amino acid residues 135–350 of MutY with an extension of 14 nucleotides covering residues 22–25. PCR fragments 1 and 2 contain a 28-bp overlapping region and were used as templates for the third PCR with primers ChangYGSTF and Chang349. The final PCR product was digested with BamHI and XhoI and ligated into the BamHI/XhoI-digested pGEX4T-2 vector (Amersham Biosciences) to generate plasmid pGEXΔ. The mutY gene in pGEXΔ was isolated as a BamHI/XhoI-digested fragment and transferred into pET21a (Novagen) to generate plasmid pETΔ26–134. The sequence of pETΔ26–134 was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The mutY gene in the pET21a vector is under the control of the T7 promoter and can produce a fusion protein with 14 residues (MASMTGGQQMGRGS) of the T7 tag. Protein Expression and Purification—E. coli strain GM7724/DE3 harboring expression plasmid pETΔ26–134 was grown in LB broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. The host GM7724/DE3 cell has the chromosomal mutY gene replaced with a transposon and does not contain any MutY activity. Protein expression was induced at A600 = 0.6 by adding isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside to a final concentration of 0.4 mm to the culture at 20 °C. The cells were harvested 16 h after induction. The mutant MutY protein was purified using a strategy similar that employed for the wild-type MutY enzyme (29Tsai-Wu J.-J. Liu H.-F. Lu A-L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 8779-8783Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Cells (11 g of cell paste) were resuspended in 45 ml of buffer A (20 mm potassium phosphate (pH 7.4), 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) containing 100 mm KCl and disrupted with a bead beater. In brief, the MutY(Δ26–134) protein was purified by 45% ammonium sulfate precipitation and phosphocellulose, hydroxylapatite, and heparin chromatography. Fraction IV (the pool from the hydroxylapatite column) was loaded onto a 1-ml High-Trap heparin column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with buffer A containing 50 mm KCl and 10% glycerol. Upon washing with 5 ml of the equilibration buffer, the column was eluted with a 30-ml linear gradient of KCl (0.05–0.7 m) in buffer A. Two MutY peaks were observed on the heparin column: one eluted at 0.23 m KCl, and the other eluted at 0.4 m KCl. Fractions containing the majority of the MutY protein that eluted at 0.4 m KCl were pooled (Fraction VIB), divided into small aliquots, and stored at -80 °C. Protein concentration was determined by the method of Bradford (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217548) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide Substrates—The DNA substrates used in this study were as follows: 19-mer, 5′-CCGAGGAATTXGCCTTCTG-3′ (top strand) and 3′-GCTCCTTAAYCGGAAGACG-5′ (bottom strand); and 40-mer, 5′-AATTGGGCTCCTCGAGGAATTXGCCTTCTGCAGGCATGCC-3′ and 3′-CCCGAGGAGCTCCTTAAYCGGAAGACGTCCGTACGGGGCC-5′ (bottom strand) (where X = A or C and Y = G or GO). The top strands were labeled at the 5′-end with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase and then annealed with the bottom strands. The single-stranded overhangs were filled in with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I and unlabeled deoxynucleotide triphosphates as described by Lu et al. (10Lu A-L. Tsai-Wu J.-J. Cillo J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 23582-23588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Radioactively labeled DNA substrates were used for gel mobility shift, trapping, and glycosylase assays. For fluorescence anisotropy assays, a fluorescein (Fl) tag (6-carboxyfluorescein) was linked to the 5′-ends of the top strands of the 19-mer oligonucleotides. Applicable DNA substrates are indicated by the prefix “Fl.” For fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays, the top strand of the 19-mer oligonucleotide containing the mismatched adenine was linked with Cy3 at either the 5′- or 3′-end. DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (Coralville, IA). MutY Gel Mobility Shift Assays—The MutY binding assay with labeled oligonucleotide substrates was performed as described by Lu (31Lu A-L. Vaughan P. DNA Repair Protocols: Prokaryotic Systems. Humana Press Inc., Totowa, NJ2000: 3-16Google Scholar) with some modifications. The MutY binding reaction mixture contained 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 80 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 2.9% glycerol, 20 ng of poly(dI-dC), and 1.8 fmol of labeled DNA (90 pm) in a total volume of 20 μl. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the mixture was supplemented with 2 μl of 50% glycerol and analyzed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel in 50 mm Tris borate (pH 8.3) and 1 mm EDTA. To determine Kd values, eight different MutY enzyme concentrations were used to bind DNA substrates in experiments repeated at least three times. Bands corresponding to enzyme-bound and free DNAs were quantified from PhosphorImager images, and Kd values were obtained from the protein concentrations that resulted in 50% maximal binding. To determine the relationship between the gel mobility and the polyacrylamide percentage in the gel, the reactions were quadrupled, and one-fourth was loaded to 4, 6, 8, and 10% polyacrylamide gels. Electrophoresis was carried out in parallel at a constant 20 mA/gel. MutY Trapping and Glycosylase Assays—Covalent complexes of MutY with DNA substrates were formed by the trapping assay in a 10-μl reaction containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 2.9% glycerol, and 0.1 m NaBH4. A stock solution of NaBH4 (1 m) was freshly prepared and added immediately after the enzyme was added. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, 2.5 μl of 5-fold concentrated dye buffer containing 25% glycerol, 5% SDS, 155 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.5 mg/ml bromphenol blue was added to the samples, which were heated at 90 °C for 3 min and separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of SDS according to Laemmli (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). The glycosylase assay was carried out similarly to the trapping assay, except that 50 μg/ml bovine serum albumin was added, and NaBH4 was omitted. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, the reaction mixtures were supplemented with 1 μlof1 m NaOH and heated at 90 °C for 30 min. Five μl of formamide dye (90% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) was added to the sample, which was heated at 90 °C for 2 min; and 5 μl of the mixture was loaded onto a 14% polyacrylamide sequencing gel containing 7 m urea. Fluorescence Anisotropy Assays—Fluorescence anisotropy was measured using the Beacon 2000 variable temperature fluorescence polarization system (Panvera, Madison, WI) equipped with fluorescein excitation (490 nm) and emission (535 nm) filters. Unless otherwise noted, binding reactions were performed as described for gel mobility shift assays, except that no glycerol was added, the DNA concentration was 2 nm, and the reaction volume was 100 μl. Each sample was read as a blank prior to addition of Fl-DNA. After adding Fl-DNA, samples were incubated for 1 min before measurement of anisotropy (Am) and total fluorescence emission (F535). Preliminary on-rate analyses indicated that anisotropic equilibrium was reached within 15 s under these conditions (data not shown). Each data point represents the mean of 10 measurements for each binding reaction. MutY binding to DNA substrates was considered in terms of a binding model in which a single fluorescent DNA substrate (Fl-DNA) may be sequentially targeted by multiple protein molecules (P) to yield a saturated protein·DNA complex (Equation 1).Fl-DNA+P⇌Fl-DNA·PFl-DNA·P+P⇌Fl-DNA·P2↓Fl-DNA·Px−1+P⇌Fl-DNA·Px(Eq. 1) Association of the MutY protein with Fl-DNA substrates was detected by an increase in the anisotropy of the Fl-DNA emission because of restricted segmental motion and retarded rotational correlation time in the protein·DNA complexes relative to the free DNA substrate (33Jameson D.M. Sawyer W.H. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 246: 283-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 34Weber G. Biochem. J. 1952; 51: 155-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar, 35Wilson G.M. Sutphen K. Chuang K. Brewer G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8695-8704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, association of MutY proteins with Fl-DNA substrates also induced a concomitant decrease in the fluorescence quantum yield (Q), thus diminishing the contributions of protein-bound Fl-DNA to Am relative to unbound Fl-DNA. To correct for this effect, fractional contributions of bound and unbound Fl-DNAs to Am were considered using the two-component model described by Dandliker et al. (36Dandliker W.B. Hsu M.L. Levin J. Rao B.R. Methods Enzymol. 1981; 74: 3-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), given in Equation 2.[Fl-DNA·Px][Fl-DNA]=Am−ADNAAcomplex−Am×QDNAQcomplex=Ac−ADNAAcomplex−Ac(Eq. 2) Solving for the quantum yield-corrected anisotropy (Ac) of each binding reaction yields Equation 3,Ac=ADNA+((Am−ADNA)/(Acomplex−Am))(QDNA/Qcomplex)Acomplex1+((Am−ADNA)/(Acomplex−Am))(QDNA/Qcomplex)(Eq. 3) where ADNA and Acomplex are the measured anisotropy values of the free Fl-DNA and the saturated protein·Fl-DNA complex (Fl-DNA·Px), respectively, solved as the averaged Am of at least three independent samples lacking protein (ADNA) or in the presence of saturating protein concentrations (Acomplex; [P] > 700 nm). Averaged F535 values for comparable samples resolved the quantum yield ratio (QDNA/Qcomplex). Although this model does not explicitly assess contributions of intermediate peptide·Fl-DNA complexes to Am, its utility for approximation of multistep MutY/Fl-DNA equilibria in this study is supported by (i) the cooperative nature of binding events with respect to [P], which ensures that fractional concentrations of intermediate peptide·Fl-DNA complexes remain low; and (ii) observations that fluorescence anisotropy and quantum yield change concomitantly as a function of [P], suggesting that individual protein binding events may simultaneously influence both emission parameters. Although it was not possible to assess binding constants describing individual steps of oligomeric protein assembly on Fl-DNA substrates by this model, indices of binding affinity and cooperativity were estimated by Equation 4,Ac=Ac−DNA+(Ac−complex−Ac−DNA)×(([P]/[P]1/2)h1+([P]/[P]1/2)h)(Eq. 4) where Ac-DNA and Ac-complex are the corrected anisotropy values of the unbound and protein-saturated Fl-DNA substrates, respectively; [P]½ is the protein concentration yielding half-maximal DNA saturation; and h is the Hill coefficient. Nonlinear regression analyses of Ac data sets taken across at least 20 protein concentrations were performed using PRISM Version 3.0 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA). FRET Analyses—Protein-DNA binding reactions were assembled as described for fluorescence anisotropy analyses (above), except that the A/GO-containing Fl-DNA substrate (5 nm) was mixed with an equal amount of unlabeled or 5′-or3′-Cy3-labeled A/GO-containing DNA and then incubated with 500 nm MutY(Δ26–134) or MutY protein at 37 °C for 5 min in a 60-μl reaction mixture. For controls, unlabeled A/GO-containing DNA substrate (5 nm) was mixed with an equal amount of 5′- or 3′-Cy3-labeled A/GO-containing DNA in similar reactions. Potential co-localization of DNA substrates containing fluorescent donor (Fl) and acceptor (Cy3) moieties was assessed by measurement of FRET efficiency (EFRET) from the decrease in emission of the A/GO-containing Fl-DNA substrate (λex = 490 nm and λem = 518 nm) in the presence of Cy3-labeled DNA (FDA) relative to samples containing the donor alone (FD) using Equation 5 (37Clegg R.M. Methods Enzymol. 1992; 211: 353-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar, 38Lakowicz J.R. Principles of Fluorescence Spectroscopy. 2nd Ed. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1999: 367-394Crossref Google Scholar).EFRET=1−(FDA/FD)(Eq. 5) If protein·DNA complexes include more than one DNA molecule, an equimolar mixture of A/GO-containing Fl-DNA and Cy3-conjugated DNA substrates would result in donor-acceptor co-localization in at least 50% of all cases. Accordingly, the maximal scalar distance (r) between Fl and Cy3 moieties in such complexes could be resolved by Equation 6,EFRET=0.5(R06/(R06+r6))(Eq. 6) where R0 is the distance yielding EFRET of 50%. For the Fl donor-Cy3 acceptor pair linked to DNA, R0 has been calculated as 55.7 Å (39Norman D.G. Grainger R.J. Uhrin D. Lilley D.M. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6317-6324Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). All fluorescence readings were taken using a Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer (Varian Instruments, Walnut Creek, CA) with the Peltier multicell holder and temperature controller accessories. Gel Filtration Analysis—A Superose 12 10/300 gel filtration column (24 ml; Amersham Biosciences) was equilibrated with buffer A containing 200 mm KCl and 10% glycerol. MutY(Δ26–134) (0.2 ml of Fraction VIB, 1 mg/ml) was loaded onto the column, and the column was developed with the same buffer at flow rate of 0.25 ml/min. Size markers (carbonic anhydrase, ovalbumin, bovine serum albumin, and β-amylase) were loaded onto the same column in a separate run. Elution profiles of the proteins were determined by a UV detector. Glycerol Gradient Centrifugation—Intact MutY (4 μl of 7 mg/ml) or MutY(Δ26–134) (25 μl of 1 mg/ml) was mixed with size markers in buffer A containing 50 mm KCl in a final volume of 0.1 ml and layered on top of a 5.0-ml 15–35% (v/v) glycerol gradient. The gradients were spun for 22 h at 45,000 rpm in a Sorvall AH650 rotor at 4 °C. Fractions of one drop were collected from the bottom of the tube, and aliquots were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. To determine the sedimentation coefficient of MutY·DNA complexes, 1.5 μm 19-mer Fl-DNA was incubated with 1.5 or 6 μm MutY or MutY(Δ26–134) protein at 37 °C for 1 min as described for fluorescence anisotropy assays, except that no poly(dI-dC) was added. The protein·DNA complexes were loaded onto the glycerol gradient and processed as free protein. The elution positions of the marker proteins (β-amylase, transferrin, bovine serum albumin, ovalbumin, and carbonic anhydrase) were determined by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining, and the MutY protein were determined by Western blot analyses. Other Methods—Measurement of mutation frequency and iron assay were performed as described by Lu and Wright (40Lu A-L. Wright P.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 3742-3750Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In Vivo Complementation Activity of the MutY(Δ26–134) Mutant—E. coli cells with a single mutation in the mutY or mutM gene are moderate mutators; however, the mutYmutM double mutant is a strong mutator because it fails to remove GO lesions and to correct replication errors (41Michaels M.L. Tchou J. Grollman A.P. Miller J.H. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10964-10968Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar, 42Radicella J.P. Clark E.A. Fox M.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9674-9678Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the absence of functional MutY and MutM, a high level of mutations in the rifampicin-binding site of RNA polymerase renders the cell resistant to rifampicin. As shown in Table I (second line), cells with mutations in both the mutY and mutM genes have a very high mutation frequency (11Michaels M.L. Cruz C. Grollman A.P. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7022-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar). To study the in vivo complementation activity of the MutY(Δ26–134) mutant, the pETΔ26–134 plasmid was transformed into CC104mutYmutM/DE3 cells. This cell strain was used to test the in vivo activity of the MutY(Δ26–134) mutant because we have shown that it offers a very sensitive assay due to the low protein expression level in this strain (43Li L.

https://openalex.org/W2039213421,"Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and endothelial lipase (EL), the most closely related enzymes among the members of the triglyceride lipase gene family with regard to primary sequence, have distinct lipolytic properties (triglyceride lipase vs. phospholipase) as well as different preferences for specific types of lipoproteins [triglyceride-rich lipoproteins vs. high density lipoprotein (HDL)] Lipid substrate specificity is believed to be conferred by the lid region located in the amino-terminal domain of the enzymes, whereas surprisingly little work has been done to identify the region mediating lipoprotein substrate specificity. To determine the domain responsible for lipoprotein preference within each enzyme, we generated the domain chimeric enzyme LPL-EL. The heterologous carboxy-terminal (C terminal) domain did not change lipid substrate preference (triglyceride vs. phospholipase) as determined by using artificial substrates. The EL C-terminal domain, however, enabled LPL-EL to bridge HDL particles like wild-type EL, whereas LPL only mediated binding of very low density lipoprotein. Unlike wild-type LPL, LPL-EL had substantial ability to hydrolyze HDL lipids similar to that of wild-type EL. Overexpression of LPL-EL in wild-type mice resulted in significantly reduced levels of HDL cholesterol and phospholipids by 93 and 85%, respectively, similar to the extent seen in EL-expressing mice, whereas no reduction of these parameters was observed in LPL-expressing mice. We conclude that the C-terminal domain of EL is crucial for the ability of EL to bind and to hydrolyze HDL and converts LPL to an enzyme fully capable of hydrolyzing HDL, highlighting the importance of the C-terminal lipase domain in lipoprotein substrate preference."
https://openalex.org/W2062105025,"SCFSkp2 is a multisubunit E3 ubiquitin ligase responsible for ubiquitination of cell cycle inhibitor p27. Ubiquitination of p27 requires an adapter protein, Cks1, to be in direct association with Skp2. The exact interface between Skp2 and Cks1 has not been elucidated. Here we have reported the definition of the critical functional interface between Skp2 and Cks1. We have identified eight amino acid residues in two discrete regions of Skp2 that are engaged in Cks1 binding. Mutation of any of these eight residues alone or in combination results in the loss of Cks1 association and negates Skp2-dependent p27 ubiquitination. These eight amino acid residues map on the same side of the Skp2 structure and likely constitute a functional binding surface for Cks1. Four of the eight amino acid residues are located in the largely unstructured carboxyl-terminal tail region of Skp2. These results uncovered the specificity of the Skp2-Cks1 interaction and reveal a critical function for the structurally flexible carboxyl-terminal tail region of Skp2 in Cks1 recognition and substrate ubiquitination.

Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). At the “handle” are the three helices that constitute the F-box motif that is responsible for binding Skp1. The ten leucine-rich repeats form the concave “blade” of the sickle. The 34 amino acid residues in the carboxyl-terminal tail of Skp2 are unstructured and packed against the concave surface in the crystals (19Schulman B.A. Carrano A.C. Jeffrey P.D. Bowen Z. Kinnucan E.R. Finnin M.S. Elledge S.J. Harper J.W. Pagano M. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 2000; 408: 381-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). It has not been determined whether this packing is physiologically relevant. The structure of Skp2 itself offers little hints as to how it recruits substrates like p27. Previous studies with another F-box protein Grr1 indicate that the concave LRR may be involved in direct recognition of the substrate as mutations in the basic amino acid residues on the surface of the leucinerich repeats abolish substrate ubiquitination (20Hsiung Y.G. Chang H.C. Pellequer J.L. La Valle R. Lanker S. Wittenberg C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2506-2520Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). It is not clear whether Skp2 uses a similar mechanism to recruit p27.We have previously shown that Cks1 binds to the carboxyl-terminal region of Skp2 and that a negatively charged amino acid residue at position 331 of Skp2 is essential for the Skp2-Cks1 interaction (21Wang W. Ungermannova D. Chen L. Liu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32390-32396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In this report, we defined the functional binding interface between Skp2 and Cks1. Four amino acid residues in the unstructured carboxyl-terminal region of Skp2 are required for Cks1 binding and substrate recruitment. Therefore, our data indicate that the carboxyl-terminal tail of Skp2 does not negatively regulate substrate recruitment; instead, the flexibility of this region is crucial for substrate recruitment through binding of the adapter protein Cks1 and subsequent ubiquitination of the substrate.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESDNA Expression Constructs and Recombinant Proteins—Mammalian expression vector pEXL-Skp2 has been described previously (21Wang W.

Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10669-10674Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). All Skp2 deletion or point mutations were constructed by the QuikChange site-specific mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Recombinant Cks1, Cdc34, and Myc proteins were purified as described previously (21Wang W. Ungermannova D. Chen L. Liu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32390-32396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Recombinant baculoviruses expressing GST 1The abbreviations used are: GST, glutathione S-transferase; E1, ubiquitin-activating enzyme; E2, ubiquitin carrier protein; E3, ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase.-Cyclin E and Cdk2 were kindly provided by Dr. Wade Harper. Baculoviruses were amplified in Sf9 cells, and coinfections were carried out in HiFive cells (Invitrogen). The Cyclin E-Cdk2 complex was purified using GST affinity chromatography and stored in QA buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 100 m KCl, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm dithiothreitol, pH 7.7) at -80 °C (21Wang W. Ungermannova D. Chen L. Liu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32390-32396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Binding Assays—Wild type and Skp2 mutants were synthesized and labeled with [35S]Met using a transcription and translation in vitro kit (Promega). To assess the ability of Skp2 and Cks1 to interact, binding assays were performed by incubating 10 μl of 35S-labeled Skp2 with 1 μg of GST-Cks1 or GST-Myc in 0.5 ml of NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40) at 4 °C for 1 h. GST beads were added to the mixture and incubated for 1 h prior to pelleting by brief centrifugation. The beads were washed three times with 0.5 ml of NETN buffer and boiled in 2× SDS loading buffer prior to SDS-PAGE analysis. The results of binding were expressed as the percentage of labeled proteins retained on the beads relative to total input. The binding efficiency of Skp2 mutants was expressed as the strength relative to the wild type Skp2.Preparation of the Wild Type and Mutant SCFSkp2 Complex—The wild type Skp2 and various Skp2 mutants were amplified using PCR to introduce EcoRI and XhoI sites and subcloned into pFAST-HTb vector (Invitrogen) prior to transformation into DH10Bac cells (Invitrogen). Genomic DNA for each construct derived from DH10Bac cells that has undergone successful recombination was prepared according to the manufacturer's instructions and subsequently transfected into Sf9 cells using Cellfectin (Invitrogen). Two days after transfection, supernatants containing infectious viruses were collected and amplified twice. High titer viral stocks were harvested and stored for coinfection experiments. To prepare indicated SCF complexes, recombinant wild type or mutant Skp2 viruses were coinfected in HiFive cells (Invitrogen) with baculoviruses encoding GST-Skp1, HA-Cul1, and Rbx1 (kindly provided by W. Harper, Harvard Medical School). Construction of these recombinant viruses has been described previously. Two days after infection, cells were harvested and lysed by three freeze/thaw cycles. SCF complexes were purified using glutathione beads (Amersham Biosciences).In Vitro Ubiquitination Assay—Recombinant Skp2 and Skp2 mutant proteins were synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate by in vitro transcription/translation. The amounts of Skp2 and Skp2 mutants produced in this system were measured by immunoblotting with an anti-Skp2 antibody. Expression of the endogenous rabbit Skp2 is virtually undetectable by immunoblotting in the control lysates. Reconstitution of the Skp2-dependent ubiquitination of p27 was accomplished by incubating in vitro translated 35S-labeled p27 that was phosphorylated by GST-Cyclin E-Cdk2 with 30 μl of reticulocyte lysates primed with Skp2 or Skp2 mutants. The ubiquitination reaction was carried out by adding 250 ng of recombinant E1, 3 μg of 6× His-Cdc34, 1 μg of ubiquitin, 1.5 μg of methylated ubiquitin (Boston Biochem), 1 μm ubiquitin aldehyde, 2 μl of MG 132, 2.5 μl of 10 × energy regeneration system (ER), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μg of Cks1. The reaction was incubated at 30 °C for 2 h. The products of the ubiquitination reaction were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and quantified by phosphorimaging analysis.Immunoblotting Analysis—Recombinant proteins were synthesized using a coupled transcription and translation system (Promega). To measure the levels of recombinant protein in the reticulocyte lysates, a portion of the samples was resolved by 8 or 12% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose. Western blot analysis was performed using the anti-Skp2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Rbx1 (Neomarker), anti-GST (Santa Cruz), or anti-HA (Covance) antibodies. The proteins were detected using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (GE Healthcare) with an ECL WestDura detection kit (Pierce).RESULTSRequirement of the Carboxyl-terminal Tail Region of Skp2 for Cks1 Association—Ubiquitination of phosphorylated p27 can be reconstituted in vitro using recombinant or purified E1, E2 (Cdc34 or UbcH5), and SCFSkp2 complex in the presence of Cyclin E-Cdk2 complex and Cks1. It has been shown that Cks1 binds to Skp2 in vitro and interaction between Cks1 and Skp2 is required for ubiquitination of p27 (14Ganoth D. Bornstein G. Ko T.K. Larsen B. Tyers M. Pagano M.

Chem. 2003; 278: 32390-32396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To understand the function of Cks1 in p27 ubiquitination, it is necessary to determine how Cks1 interacts with Skp2. Previous studies indicate that the carboxyl-terminal region of Skp2 is required for its association with Cks1 and this region may contain a specific binding site for Cks1 (Fig. 1) (21Wang W. Ungermannova D. Chen L. Liu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32390-32396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To further define critical amino acid residues that are involved in the Skp2-Cks1 interaction, segments of Skp2 were removed by deletion and the resulting mutants were assayed for their ability to interact with Cks1. As shown in Fig. 1, deletion of the last 34 amino acid residues of Skp2 abolishes the Skp2-Cks1 interaction. In contrast, removal of the last 22 amino acid residues does not significantly affect the association. This result suggests that Skp2 amino acids 403–415 harbor important amino acid residues that mediate the Skp2-Cks1 interaction.To identify critical amino acid residues that specify the interaction between Skp2 and Cks1, alanine scanning mutagenesis was performed. First, we constructed a series of double alanine substitution mutants covering the region between amino acid 403 and 415. Binding studies with these mutants indicate that three double alanine substitution mutants (AA for F405A,T406A or T407A,I408A or R410A,P411A) are defective in binding to Cks1 (Fig. 1C). To further evaluate the relative importance of each of the six amino acid residues in the Cks1 interaction, single alanine substitution mutants were also generated. Interestingly, mutation of Thr-407 and Pro-411 has no effect on Cks1 association and changes in Ile-408 and Arg-410 completely abolish Cks1 binding, whereas individual alteration of Phe-405 and Thr-406 only partially affects Cks1 association in sharp contrast to the strong effects of the double mutant (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these data indicate that only four amino acid residues in the carboxyl-terminal tail region of Skp2 are involved in binding Cks1.Skp2-dependent p27 Ubiquitination in the Rabbit Reticulocyte System—Now that we had defined critical amino acid residues involved in Cks1 binding in the carboxyl-terminal tail region of Skp2, it was essential to determine whether these mutations affect the ability of Skp2 to catalyze p27 ubiquitination. Such an analysis was typically done by expressing Skp2 variants in a baculovirus expression system and reconstituting the SCF complex by coexpression of other subunits of SCF in insect cells. The SCFSkp2 complex was affinity purified, and the ubiquitination reaction was carried out by incubating phosphorylated p27 with E1, E2(Cdc34), and purified SCFSkp2. It is rather laborious and impractical to test each of the Skp2 mutants in this system. We sought to develop a high throughput Skp2-dependent ubiquitination system to allow us to systematically analyze Skp2 function in vitro. Harper and coworkers (23Koepp D.M. Schaefer L.K. Ye X. Keyomarsi K. Chu C. Harper J.W. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 173-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (651) Google Scholar) have previously shown that significant amounts of Rbx1, Cul1, and Skp1 exist in rabbit reticulocyte lysates and that functional SCF complexes can be assembled when the F-box protein is supplied by in vitro translation. The levels of endogenous Skp2 were virtually undetectable in reticulocyte lysates, allowing us to test whether we can reconstitute Skp2-depedent p27 ubiquitination using this system. As shown in Fig. 2, very robust p27 ubiquitination occurs when recombinant E1, E2, Cks1, and Cyclin E-Cdk2 were incubated with phosphorylated p27 in the presence of in vitro translated cold Skp2 (Fig. 2, lane 2). No significant p27 ubiquitination was observed when in vitro translated Skp2 was omitted (Fig. 2, lane 7). In addition, efficient ubiquitination of p27 requires Cyclin E-Cdk2, Cks1, and to a lesser extent E2 and E1 (Fig. 2, lanes 5 and 6). It has been well documented that reticulocyte lysates contain significant amounts of E1 and E2 enzymes, and therefore adding exogenous E1 and E2 does not have a significant impact on p27 ubiquitination. The pattern and requirements for p27 ubiquitination are virtually identical to the reactions worked out using purified SCF complex from insect cells (21Wang W. Ungermannova D. Chen L. Liu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32390-32396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Therefore, this assay allows faithful investigation of Skp2 function in vitro.Fig. 2Skp2-dependent ubiquitination of p27 in vitro.

The expression levels of various Skp2 mutants in the reticulocyte lysates were comparable as determined by immunoblotting using an anti-Skp2 antibody (Fig. 3). To make sure that mutations introduced in Skp2 did not result in protein misfolding, each of the Skp2 mutants was analyzed for its ability to bind recombinant c-Myc. It has been shown previously that Skp2 binds c-Myc and that the region of Skp2 involved in c-Myc binding is located outside the carboxyl-terminal region of Skp2 (24Kim S.Y. Herbst A. Tworkowski K.A.

All the Skp2 mutants constructed retained their ability to bind c-Myc, implying that none of these mutations appears to denature Skp2 (data not shown).Fig. 3Effects of Skp2 mutants on p27 ubiquitination in vitro.

Invariably, Skp2 mutants that failed to bind Cks1 efficiently are incapable of causing p27 ubiquitination efficiently, except Skp2 (1–415), which is able to bind Cks1 yet unable to support substrate ubiquitination. Three double mutants (F405A,T406A, T407A,I408A, R410A,P411A) are clearly defective in supporting p27 ubiquitination (Fig. 3, C and D). Results from analysis of single mutants indicate that T407A and P411A have no effect and F405A or T406A alone only caused a slight reduction in p27 ubiquitination in contrast to the dramatic effects observed with the double mutant (Fig. 3, E and F). Thus, functional analysis of Skp2 mutants clearly supports the importance of Phe-405, Thr-406, Ile-408, and Arg-410 in mediating the Skp2-Cks1 interaction and subsequent ubiquitination of the substrate.Identification of a Second Cks1 Binding Interface in Skp2— Our previous study indicates that Asp-331 is critical for the Skp2-Cks1 association (21Wang W. Ungermannova D. Chen L. Liu X. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32390-32396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). A conservative change from Asp to Glu at this position does not affect the Skp2-Cks1 interaction, suggesting a negatively charged amino acid at this position is required. Charged amino acids are usually responsible for the specificity of protein-protein interactions but do not contribute to the binding energy. Surface-exposed hydrophobic amino acid residues often provide the main source of binding energy that drives protein-protein association. Thus, additional amino acid residues in close three-dimensional proximity are likely to be involved in mediating the Skp2-Cks1 interaction.Because Asp-331 is located on the concave surface of Skp2 near the end of the S8 β-sheet, we reasoned that other residues that form the Cks1 binding surface in Skp2 may be located in the loops on the same side as Asp-331 and be surface exposed. Upon close examination of the Skp2 crystal structure, we identified a number of surface-exposed hydrophobic or charged residues that are likely candidates for mediating the Skp2-Cks1 interaction.As demonstrated in Fig. 4, mutation of surface-exposed hydrophobic amino acid residues near Asp-331 has variable effects on the Skp2-Cks1 interaction. Whereas W277A completely abrogates the Skp2-Cks1 association, the impact of the F380A mutation is less dramatic and the Y358A mutation has no effect at all (Fig. 4A). We have also mutated several surface-exposed positively charged amino acid residues located near Asp-331; only the R356A mutation abolishes the Skp2-Cks1 interaction. The effects of these mutants on p27 ubiquitination were analyzed by the Skp2-dependent ubiquitination assay described above. W277A, R356A, and F380A were unable to support p27 ubiquitination, and Tyr-380 behaves like the wild type Skp2 (Fig. 4, G and H). Taken together, these data suggest that Asp-331, Trp-277, Arg-356, and Phe-380 define a second interface in Skp2 that is required for Cks1 interaction and p27 ubiquitination (Table I).Fig. 4Identification of critical amino acid residues adjacent in space to Asp-331 of Skp2 in the three-dimensional structure that are essential for binding to Cks1.

Strikingly, these amino acid residues cluster close to each other and are located on the same side of the Skp2 molecule. They are arranged in a semi-ring configuration and apparently constitute a structural binding motif for Cks1. The structural modeling data suggest that Cks1 likely docks on Skp2 from one side of the molecule and the unstructured loop regions of Skp2 are engaged in this interaction.Fig. 5Locations of the critical amino acid residues that are involved in binding Cks1 mapped to the Skp2 structure.
