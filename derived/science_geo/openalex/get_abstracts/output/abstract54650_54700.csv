https://openalex.org/W1567882028,"Abstract Evidence is presented to identify plasma membranes of liver as the major locus of binding for circulating glycoproteins. The binding process involves a dual role for sialic acid in that its presence on the membranes is essential, whereas its presence on the glycoprotein is incompatible with binding. Enzymatic restoration of sialic acid residues onto partially desialylated membranes is accompanied by increased binding activity and is suggestive of the presence of an intrinsic membrane-associated sialyltransferase. In addition to the requirement for sialic acid, the binding of proteins by plasma membranes exhibits an absolute dependence upon the presence of calcium. Changes in the concentration of this ion, within the pH range of 6.0 to 7.8, result in a rapid reversal of the binding process and provide a model system for the study of protein uptake and transport by the intact liver cell."

With use of this technique, mitochondria from a chilling-sensitive plant and a homeothermic animal displayed temperature-dependent phase transitions at approximately 12° and 23°, respectively. These temperatures coincide identically with the temperatures below which chillingsensitive plants (12°) or homeothermic animals (23°) are injured upon exposure. Mitochondria from a chilling-resistant plant and a poikilothermic animal did not display any such phase transitions. These data indicate that some membrane-bound enzymes are sensitive to the physical state of membrane lipids."

Administration of aldosterone significantly decreases this angiotensinforming enzyme activity, while administration of progesterone markedly enhances it."
https://openalex.org/W1484500255,"Abstract Guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) increased the rate of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) hydrolysis by phosphodiesterase preparations from several tissues. Stimulation of cyclic AMP hydrolysis occurred with initial concentrations of cyclic GMP as low as 0.08 µm and was seen with particulate phosphodiesterase preparations from rat liver, brain, kidney, heart, and thymus and with soluble preparations from liver and thymus. Higher concentrations of cyclic GMP (g 50 µm) were inhibitory to cyclic AMP hydrolysis in rat liver extracts. Inosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic IMP) also stimulated the hydrolysis of cyclic AMP but was somewhat less effective than cyclic GMP. 5'-GMP,5'-IMP, uridine 3',5'-monophosphate, thymidine 3',5'-monophosphate, and guanosine had no effect. Cyclic AMP and cyclic IMP inhibited the hydrolysis of cyclic GMP by liver supernatant fractions. Fractionation of rat liver extracts with ammonium sulfate yielded one fraction of phosphodiesterase activity that was stimulated by cyclic GMP and one that was not. The stimulatory effect of cyclic GMP on cyclic AMP hydrolysis by soluble and particulate liver phosphodiesterases was not seen in the presence of the nonionic detergents Triton X-100 or Lubrol PX."
https://openalex.org/W1575360750,"Abstract The maximum amount of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) bound to a number of proteins in the presence of high SDS concentrations (1 to 2 g/100 ml) was determined and found to vary between 1.1 and 2.2 g of SDS per g of protein. The charge of the protein caused a variation in amount bound by 20 to 50%, while raising the ionic strength from 0.1 to 0.4 increased the binding by 35 to 100%. Glucose oxidase did not bind or lose activity in 1 g of SDS per 100 ml. Papain and pepsin were much more resistant to binding and activity loss than other proteins. All other single chained proteins bound SDS within 3 hours. Most proteins composed of subunits bound SDS much more slowly, invariably dissociating to the subunit."

This compound, which is produced in the kidney from 25-hydroxycholecalciferol, has been previously shown to be from 4 to 13 times as active as cholecalciferol in stimulating intestinal calcium transport. 1,25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol (previously designated metabolite 4B in this laboratory) probably represents the biologically active form of cholecalciferol in the intestine."
https://openalex.org/W1975297165,"The isolated taenia coli of the guinea pig takes up tritiated adenosine, adenosine monophosphate, adenosine diphosphate, and adenosine triphosphate, in preference to tritiated inosine and adenine. After uptake, [(3)H]adenosine is converted and retained primarily as [(3)H]adenosine triphosphate. Tritium is released from taenia coli treated with [(3)H]adenosine upon activation of the nonadrenergic inhibitory nerves. These results are consistent with the previous evidence that adenosine triphosphate may be the transmitter from the nerves."
https://openalex.org/W1573299086,"Abstract Treatment of bovine liver microsomes with a partially purified preparation of phospholipase A from Naja naja venom leads to activation of UDP-glucuronyltransferase with p-nitrophenol as glucuronyl acceptor. This stimulation of activity is due to a 6-fold increase in activity at Vmax. As activity at Vmax increases, there is a progressive decrease in binding affinity of the enzyme for both substrates, and although the enzyme remains stable at 23°, it becomes unstable at 37°. This unstable form of UDP-glucuronyltransferase decays to another stable form with a maximum activity 2.5-fold greater than that of untreated enzyme. As with phospholipase A, treatment with phospholipase C also activates UDP-glucuronyltransferase, but to a lesser extent. In addition to phospholipases other agents which can alter microsomal lipids also activate UDP-glucuronyltransferase. Triton X-100, sonication, and exposure to pH 9.8 increased activity at Vmax and had variable effects on the binding constants for UDP-glucuronic acid and p-nitrophenol. Maximal activation by these treatments was less than that obtained with phospholipase A; no two treatments had similar effects on all kinetic parameters of the enzyme. Nevertheless, additive effects could not be demonstrated. Although Triton stimulated glucuronidation of p-nitrophenol by the enzyme, it was without effect on the reverse reaction. This fact plus the other data indicate that the activation of UDP-glucuronyltransferase in these experiments cannot be attributed to compartmentation of the enzyme but is due to phospholipid-induced alterations of enzyme conformation."

https://openalex.org/W1534905276,"Abstract Bovine thyroid membranes have been purified about 100-fold on the basis of thyrotropin- or F--stimulated adenyl cyclase activity. These activities copurified with Na+-K+-requiring adenosine triphosphatase, K+-stimulated p-nitrophenyl phosphatase, and 5'-nucleotidase. The adenyl cyclase of these preparations is stimulated over a wide range of bovine thyrotropin concentrations, by human chorionic thyrotropin, and sometimes by prostaglandin E1, but not by long acting thyroid stimulator. The adenyl cyclase is stable in the frozen state but loses thyrotropin and F- responsiveness rapidly at 43°. Maximal activity is obtained with a Mg++:ATP ratio of 2 and when the ATP concentration exceeds 2 mm. The thyrotropin response is enhanced by K+ ion whereas the F- response is not affected. Li+ ion inhibits strongly, especially when the Mg++ concentration is limiting. Na+ is weakly inhibitory. Both F-- and thyrotropin-stimulated cyclase activity are strongly inhibited by N-ethylmaleimide, p-chlormercuribenzoate, sodium dodecyl sulfate, filipin, sodium tetraphenylboron, valinomycin, and monensin A. Another class of agents, which includes the phenothiazines, thymol, cobramine B, and gramicidin S, inhibits thyrotropin stimulation of the enzyme but enhances the F- response. It is concluded that the thyrotropin and the adenyl cyclase (F- activation) are distinct entities, and it is suggested that prostaglandin E1 uses a different receptor than thyrotropin."
https://openalex.org/W1583804016,"Abstract Diphtheria toxin catalyzes the transfer of the adenosine diphosphate ribose portion of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to aminoacyl transferase II purified to a homogeneous state from rat liver. A stoichiometric amount of nicotinamide is released simultaneously. The ADP-ribosylation of aminoacyl transferase II results in a concomitant inactivation of this particular enzyme, which has a function in the translocation of peptidyl transfer RNA on ribosomes. The reaction is reversible, since toxin catalyzes the formation of NAD from ADP-ribosylated aminoacyl transferase II and nicotinamide with a concurrent restoration of the enzyme activity. The equilibrium constant of the ADP-ribosylation reaction is determined to be 6.3 x 10-4. From this constant the free energy of hydrolysis of the ADP-ribose transferase II linkage is calculated to be approximately 4000 cal per mole at pH 7 and 25°. The ADP-ribosylation and reverse reactions are most active at pH 8.5 and 5.2, respectively. The apparent Michaelis constants for NAD and nicotinamide are 5 x 10-6 m at pH 7.4 and 5 x 10-4 m at pH 5.2, respectively. No other derivatives of NAD so far tested are capable of replacing NAD except thionicotinamide adenine dinucleotide. Diphtheria antitoxin inhibits the reaction, and toxoid is inactive. So far aminoacyl transferase II is the sole protein species found to be ADP-ribosylated in the supernatant fraction from rat liver. Toxin catalyzes neither hydrolysis of NAD nor the exchange reaction between NAD and nicotinamide-14C."
https://openalex.org/W1586175429,"Abstract Both Group B and C meningococcal polysaccharides were shown to be pure homopolymers of sialic acid. The two polysaccharides are, however, quite different chemically and immunologically. Acetyl determinations indicated that the C-polysaccharide contains both N- and O-acetyl groups, whereas the B-polysaccharide contains N-acetyl but not O-acetyl groups. Acid-catalyzed methanolysis in anhydrous methanolic HCl at 65° showed that the C-polysaccharide is much more susceptible to the cleavage than the B-polysaccharide. Under the conditions used, only 12% of the B-polysaccharide was hydrolyzed while complete hydrolysis of the C-polysaccharide was achieved in 22 hours. On the other hand, treatment of the C-polysaccharide with two preparations of neuraminidase (Vibrio cholerae and Clostridium perfringens) resulted in the release of less than 2 to 3% of free sialic acid. The B-polysaccharide was completely hydrolyzed by the enzymes under identical conditions. Possible implications of these observations on the structures of these two polysaccharides are discussed. A new procedure for the determination of sialic acid as methyl ester-methyl glycoside of neuraminic acid (methyl-(methyl d-neuraminid)ate) or as methyl glycoside of neuraminic acid (methoxy neuraminic acid) on the amino acid analyzer has been developed and is discussed."

https://openalex.org/W1675260448,"Abstract In a transcription system containing λpgal8 DNA as template and Escherichia coli RNA polymerase, the addition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate receptor protein (CRP) and 3',5'-cyclic AMP causes a 15-fold increase in gal mRNA synthesis. Gal mRNA was measured by hybridizing the [3H]RNA product to the separated strands of λpgal8 DNA after removal of λ mRNA by preliminary hybridization to λ DNA. Competition experiments indicate that a large fraction of this RNA is identical with in vivo gal mRNA. With λpgal8 DNA as template but not with λ DNA, 3',5'-cyclic AMP and CRP cause a 2-fold increase in λ mRNA. Since the increment in λ mRNA hybridizes to the left-hand half of the ι strand of λ DNA and is abolished by the addition of ρ, it is interpreted as read through from the 3',5'-cyclic AMP-CRP sensitive site in the gal region of λpgal8 DNA. The concentrations of CRP and 3',5'-cyclic AMP necessary for half-maximal stimulation of gal mRNA synthesis are 5 x 10-8 and 5 x 10-6 m, respectively. 2',3'-Cyclic AMP and 5'-AMP do not stimulate gal mRNA synthesis; 3',5'-cyclic GMP is an inhibitor. When 3',5' cyclic AMP, CRP, DNA, and RNA polymerase are incubated together for 10 min, a rifampicin-resistant preinitiation complex is formed, and, upon the addition of nucleoside triphosphates, gal mRNA synthesis occurs. 3',5'-Cyclic GMP prevents the formation of this complex and can dissociate it after it has been formed. These results suggest that 3',5'-cyclic AMP and CRP stimulate gal transcription at a step prior to chain elongation."
https://openalex.org/W1520392929,"Abstract The two heterosaccharide chains of human transferrin have been isolated as two glycopeptides, one of which contained asparagine as its sole amino acid residue while the other contained asparagine, glycine, serine, and, occasionally, threonine. Periodic acid oxidation of either glycopeptide resulted in the uptake of 10 moles of periodate and the production of 4 moles of formate from the sialic acid-containing glycopeptides, and of 6 and 2 moles, respectively, from the sialic acid-free glycopeptides. Formaldehyde (2 moles) was obtained only from the sialic acid-containing glycopeptides. Periodate oxidation resulted in the complete destruction of sialic acid and galactose, and of 2 of the 4 moles of mannose, while N-acetylglucosamine was unaffected. These results confirm the identity of the two heterosaccharide chains of human transferrin. A disaccharide of structure GlcNAc-Man and a glycopeptide of structure GlcNAc-GlcNAc-Man-GlcNAc-Asn were isolated from the periodate oxidation experiment. Highly purified glycosidases, namely α-mannosidase, β-galactosidase, and β-N-acetylhexosaminidase established that N-acetyl-neuraminic acid (NANA) was in terminal positions and that the sequence in the area of carbohydrate attachment in the other chain of each branch was [see PDF for sequence] Mild acid hydrolysis (0.1 n at 100°) of the NANA-free glycopeptides resulted in the complete release of galactose within 4 hours while only 25% of glucosamine and 10% of mannose was released within the same time. Exhaustive methylation and gas-liquid chromatography of both the sialic acid-containing and sialic acid-free glycopeptides showed that mannose was a branch point and that each sialic acid residue was linked to galactose. On the basis of these results the following structure is proposed for each of the heterosaccharide chains of human transferrin: [see PDF for sequence]"
https://openalex.org/W1989328906,Kinetic analysis of the reassociation of DNA synthesized in vitro by a murine leukemia virus DNA polymerase revealed two classes of double-stranded product representative of 25 and 100 percent of viral genetic information. The DNA product representing the smaller portion of the viral genome comprised 85 percent of the double-stranded DNA generated in vitro and was extensively duplicated in the genomes of both normal cells and cells containing RNA tumor virus.
https://openalex.org/W1607316289,"Abstract The properties and behavior of a (100,000 x g particles) chitin synthetase of Mucor rouxii were investigated. The enzyme utilizes uridine diphosphate N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) as glycosyl donor and is strongly and specifically activated by free N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (GlcNAc). A variety of GlcNAc analogues were tested as activators but were found ineffective. A small proportion of free GlcNAc was incorporated into chitin; however, the activation of chitin synthetase by GlcNAc is probably an allosteric effect. Seemingly, UDP-GlcNAc is also a positive allosteric effector of the enzyme. Diacetylchitobiose was also synthesized in the reaction mixtures. However, the kinetics of its formation do not support the proposal that this dimer is an intermediate in chitin synthesis. Added primer was not essential for the operation of the microsomal chitin synthetase. Nevertheless, addition of higher N-acetylchitodextrins produced large stimulations indicative of primer shortage in the particles. Certain lipid extracts of M. rouxii proved to be highly stimulatory for chitin synthesis. However, efforts to obtain evidence for a lipid intermediate proved negative. Chitin synthetase was also stimulated by ATP, CTP, and GTP but UDP was inhibitory. Optimum pH was about 6.5. The enzyme was exceedingly susceptible to Mg++ concentration. Microsomal chitin synthetase was relatively stable in the frozen state if suspended in phosphate buffer but not in Tris buffer. Mitochondrial (10,000 x g) enzyme, by contrast, rapidly decayed under similar conditions."

Daunomycin inhibited the polymerases weakly, and chromomycin A(3) inhibited almost not at all. 4-N-Benzyldemethylrifampicin was a more active inhibitor than the 4-N-demethyl congener."
https://openalex.org/W1569876293,"Abstract The glucose-lipid intermediate involved in the transfer of glucosyl residues to O side chains of Salmonella typhimurium lipopolysaccharide has been characterized. It is stable to alkali and labile to acid, contains one phosphorus for one glucose, and releases a glucose phosphate in very good yields when reduced in the presence of a platinum catalyst. The glucose phosphate was blocked at C-1, was hydrolyzed by phosphomonoesterase, was not a substrate for phosphoglucomutase, and behaved slightly differently from α-d-glucose 1-phosphate on paper chromatography. These data and the observation that it is hydrolyzed more than twice as rapidly in 1 n HCl as α-d-glucose 1-phosphate indicates that the compound obtained from the intermediate is β-d-glucose 1-phosphate. Catalytic hydrogenation also releases a single, nonpolar lipid; this lipid, obtained from 3H-glucosyl 14C-lipid, appeared to be identical with the reduced lipid obtained from rhamnosylgalactosyl-1-pyrophosphorylundecaprenol on thin layer chromatography. These and other results (e.g. ease of cleavage of phosphate-lipid bond by hydrogenolysis, degradation of the lipid moiety on acid hydrolysis, and results of reverse phase chromatography) suggest that the lipid moiety of the glucose-lipid is a polyisoprenol phosphate, which is either identical or very similar to undecaprenol phosphate."
https://openalex.org/W1529038768,"Abstract Particulate enzyme preparations of Streptococcus faecalis ATCC 9790 catalyze the conversion of diglucosyl diglyceride to a new type of phosphoglycolipid which has been identified as an acylated derivative of 3-O-(2-O-α-d-glucopyranosyl-6-O-phosphoryl-3'(1')-O-sn-glycerol)-α-d-glucopyranosyl-sn-glycerol. The characterization of the lipid was greatly facilitated after the development of methods which specifically labeled with radioisotopes either the glucose, glycerol, or phosphate portions of the molecule. Periodate oxidation and differential hydrolysis catalyzed by base, acid, and enzyme (α-glucosidase) of the specifically labeled compound were the major techniques used in the identification. The deacylated water-soluble derivative of the lipid yielded a hexose-glycerol-phosphate ratio of 2.0:2.08:1.05. Analysis of the intact lipid yielded a fatty acid ester-phosphate-hexose ratio of 3.87:1.0:1.82. However, the fatty acid ester content of four is considered tentative because of certain difficulties inherent to the procedures used to isolate and purify the intact lipid. Periodate oxidation of the lipid released no formaldehyde, indicating that at least one of the fatty acids is esterified to the glycerophosphate moiety of the lipid."
https://openalex.org/W1595295966,"Abstract Uridine diphospho-α-d-galacto-hexodialdose (UDP-Gal-6-CHO) and uridine diphospho-α-d-gluco-hexodialdose (UDP-Glc-6-CHO) were produced from UDP-galactose through the use of galactose oxidase and UDP-glucose 4-epimerase. UDP-Glc-6-CHO was shown to be an intermediate in the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, indicating that the conversion of UDP-glucose to UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcUA) proceeds by two steps with UDP-Glc-6-CHO as an enzyme-bound intermediate. The first step, the formation of UDP-Glc-6-CHO from UDP-glucose, involves nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide as the oxidant, is reversible, and is highly specific for the substrate structure. UDP-Glc-6-CHO was reduced to UDP-glucose by the dehydrogenase and NADH, while UDP-Gal-6-CHO would not undergo an analogous reaction. The second step, formation of UDP-GlcUA from UDP-Glc-6-CHO, evidently accounts for the irreversibility of the over-all reaction and is less specific toward substrate structure. Both UDP-Glc-6-CHO and UDP-Gal-6-CHO will undergo this oxidation reaction with the enzyme and NAD+, although the latter reacts at about one-sixth of the rate of the former. The oxidation of UDP-Glc-6-CHO to UDP-GlcUA proceeds at exactly the same rate as does oxidation of UDP-glucose to UDP-GlcUA. The reduction of the UDP-hexodialdose with NaB3H4 constitutes a very economical synthesis of radioactive UDP-galactose."

https://openalex.org/W206613132,"Abstract DNA extracted from Novikoff hepatoma cells grown in suspension culture in the presence of [14C]methyl-labeled methionine was hydrolyzed with formic acid-diphenylamine and resultant pyrimidine clusters separated on DEAE-columns at pH 5.2. Clusters containing up to nine adjacent pyrimidines were resolved. Shorter clusters were more scarce and longer clusters more abundant than would be expected on the basis of a random distribution. Label was incorporated into 5-methylcytosine residues in clusters of all sizes with an indication of preferential methylation of cytosine in the monopyrimidine fraction. Each cluster was subfractionated according to over-all base composition with DEAE-columns at acid pH. The tetracytosine component was the longest purely cytosine-containing component detected in this DNA, but purely thymine-containing runs up to 7 residues in length were observed. There appeared to be more cytosine-containing and fewer thymine-containing components in any given cluster than might have been expected on the basis of a random distribution of the nonisomeric components. The [14C]labeling patterns both within the nonisomeric components of a given cluster and between the components of different cluster sizes indicated unique and preferential distributions of 5-methylcytosine. A small amount of label found in DNA-thymine in only some of the nonisomeric components of the pyrimidine clusters was postulated to have arisen from deamination of 5-methylcytosine at the level of polymeric DNA. The latter phenomenon has also been reported to occur in sea urchin embryo DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1571246603,"Abstract The major deoxyribonuclease induced by bacteriophage T5, as previously studied (Paul, A. V., and Lehman, I. R., J. Biol. Chem., 241, 3441 (1966)), has been purified 400-fold and has been shown to initiate hydrolysis specifically at the 5'-ends of either single or double stranded DNA. The products of hydrolysis are nucleoside 5'-monophosphates and acid-soluble 5'-phosphoryl-terminated oligonucleotides of varying lengths. The average length of the oligonucleotides is 3 residues. The purified exonuclease preparation is free from significant levels of endonuclease activity as measured on circular DNA substrates. The oligonucleotide products can therefore not be accounted for by endonucleolytic hydrolysis. The purified enzyme, in contrast to exonucleases like Escherichia coli exonuclease III, can degrade ultraviolet-irradiated DNA."
https://openalex.org/W30364276,"Abstract A highly purified preparation of cytochrome c peroxidase was prepared by reconstituting the enzyme from the apoprotein and protohemin. Paramagnetic susceptibilities of the enzyme and of its complexes with cyanide, azide, cyanate, and fluoride were measured at temperatures from 77° K to 273° K. The susceptibilities of the cyanide and fluoride complexes obeyed Curie's law over the entire temperature range and it was confirmed that these complexes are in purely low spin and high spin states. All of the other complexes, in addition to the free enzyme, were found to deviate from Curie's law above certain temperatures. The effective Bohr magneton numbers (neff) of the enzyme at different pH values were explained by assuming that cytochrome c peroxidase is a mixture of acidic and alkaline forms and that both forms have low spin and high spin states in thermal equilibria. The temperature dependence of the equilibria was also characterized spectrophotometrically for the enzyme at pH 7 and its cyanate complex. The optical measurements were in good agreement with the susceptibility measurements of the corresponding samples. The temperature-dependent changes of n2eff were analyzed on the basis of a thermal equilibrium between high spin and low spin states. Several thermodynamic parameters such as the energy difference (e), the enthalpy difference (ΔH°), and the entropy difference (ΔS°) between the two spin states, the entropy factor (γ), and the compensation temperature (Tc) were estimated from the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constants of the mixed spin states. The relation between ΔH° and ΔS° is discussed and compared with myoglobin and hemoglobin."

Priming of cells with poly(rI), followed by treatment with poly(rC), gave a consistently greater antiviral activity than poly(rI) ⋅ poly(rC) itself. This priming effect was obtained in several cell cultures challenged with different viruses. In vivo, the antiviral activity of poly(rI) ⋅ poly(rC) was only partially restored if poly(rI) and poly(rC) were injected separately; prior injection of poly(rI) proved superior in restoring this antiviral activity as compared to prior injection of poly(rC)."

https://openalex.org/W1594102341,"Abstract Citrate lyase from Aerobacter aerogenes undergoes inactivation during the course of the reaction which it catalyzes. Both the initial rate of reaction and the extent of reaction until complete inactivation are dependent on the nature of the metal ion and the amount of enzyme used. The inactivation has been attributed by others to an inhibition by enolic oxalacetate. We have also observed inhibition of the enzyme on preliminary incubation with oxalacetate, but high concentrations of either enol or keto forms are required to obtain significant inhibition. Constant removal of oxalacetate formed during the reaction by conversion to malate with the malate dehydrogenase system does not change either the rate of inactivation or the extent of reaction compared to the reaction in which oxalacetate is allowed to accumulate. Concentrations of oxalacetate, malate, NAD, NADH, and acetate that occur during the reaction, used either singly or in various combinations during a preliminary incubation, affect neither the initial rate nor the extent of the reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1496114289,"Abstract 1. Exposure of submitochondrial particles to phospholipases impaired the rate of oxidation as well as phosphorylation. Phospholipase A and phospholipase C were more inhibitory to phosphorylation and to NADH oxidation than to succinate oxidation. 2. At low concentrations of phospholipase A the inhibition of phosphorylation was prevented to a considerable extent by the presence of large amounts of bovine serum albumin preferably during both digestion and assay. At larger concentrations of phospholipase A only slight protection was observed by addition of serum albumin. 3. Exposure of submitochondrial particles to phospholipase C from Clostridium welchii in the presence of Mg++ or Mn++ inhibited the 32Pi-ATP exchange and the P:O ratio by about 30 to 60%. Addition of coupling factors restored phosphorylation associated with oxidation in these particles. Additional exposure of the digested particles to phospholipase C from Bacillus cereus in the presence of Zn++ further depressed the 32Pi-ATP exchange which was no longer restored by coupling factors. Addition of phospholipids partially restored the 32Pi-ATP exchange in these extensively digested particles. Similar effects were noted after prolonged exposure to phospholipase C from B. cereus alone, provided both Mn++ and Zn++ were present. 4. Oxidative phosphorylation was also severely impaired after exposure of submitochondrial particles to phospholipase C from B. cereus in the presence of Mn++ and Zn++. A partial restoration of the P:O ratio was achieved by reconstitution with phospholipids."
https://openalex.org/W1520448658,"Abstract The molecular weight of the Escherichia coli glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase subunit in 5 m guanidine hydrochloride containing 0.01 m dithiothreitol was determined by high speed sedimentation equilibrium to be 35,000. Amino acid composition of the protein, taken in conjunction with the number of peptides obtained after tryptic digestion, indicated that the subunits of the enzyme were very probably identical, each containing 12 arginine and 26 lysine residues. NAD+ content of the protein, measured both by spectrophotometric and enzymatic methods, was found to be very low (l0.1 mole of NAD+ per 35,000 g of protein), although capacity to strongly bind NAD+ was intact. The enzyme could be crystallized but only after addition of NAD+ to apoprotein. One cysteine residue per subunit was carboxymethylated with resultant enzymatic inactivation when native enzyme was reacted with iodoacetic acid; similarly there was one sulfhydryl group per subunit which was rapidly reactive with 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid). Under protein denaturing conditions a total of 3 cysteine residues per subunit were detected although analyses of performic acid-oxidized protein indicated four cysteic acids per subunit. Dehydrogenase activity of the enzyme was markedly sulfhydryl dependent; there was l25% of maximal activity if sulfhydryl compounds were not included in assay mixtures. Esterase activity (with p-nitrophenyl acetate as substrate) was inhibited by AMP, ADP, and ATP but not by NAD+."
https://openalex.org/W1513647180,"Abstract The longitudinal and transverse relaxation rate enhancement parameters of water protons, the number of manganese binding sites, and the dissociation constants (Kd) were correlated with enzyme activity and molecular weight changes which occur as a function of urea concentration. The results suggest that there are 4 manganese binding sites per 237,000 daltons. Upon the addition of urea to cause the transition from tetramer to still enzymatically active dimer, the total number of manganese binding sites does not change, but the Kd increases by an order of magnitude. In the transition from the active dimer to the inactive monomer by increasing the urea concentration, the number of binding sites becomes large and indeterminate, and further increases in the Kd are seen. The enhancement of both the longitudinal and transverse relaxation rates correlate with the catalytic activity of the enzyme. With aging of the enzyme, a decrease in the number of binding sites is observed, which correlates with specific activity, and there is no change in Kd."

https://openalex.org/W2148387461,"Abstract The relative abilities of a variety of phosphoanhydrides, phosphate esters, and mixed phosphate anhydrides (acyl phosphate compounds) to function (a) as substrates for hydrolase and phosphotransferase activities of rat liver microsomal d-glucose 6-phosphate phosphohydrolase (EC 3.1.3.9) and (b) as inhibitors of glucose 6-phosphate phosphohydrolase activity have been considered as a function of reaction pH. Competitive inhibitions of glucose 6-phosphate phosphohydrolase activity by adenosine 5'-triphosphate, inorganic pyrophosphate, mannose 6-phosphate, and carbamyl phosphate have been observed over the entire range of hydrogen ion concentrations studied, pH 5 to 8. In contrast, hydrolytic and synthetic activities with pyrophosphate and adenosine 5'-triphosphate have been observed only at neutral and acid pH, while glucose 6-phosphate, mannose 6-phosphate, carbamyl phosphate (and several other acyl phosphate anhydrides) are effective substrates at alkaline as well as lower pH values. Under conditions where both parameters may be determined, Km values for various compounds functioning as substrates for phosphohydrolase and phosphotransferase activities agree well with Ki values for these compounds acting as competitive inhibitors. Activity-pH profiles for both hydrolase and phosphotransferase (with glucose as acceptor molecule) activities are, with each substrate, essentially identical. It is concluded from these observations (a) that all these compounds may bind to a common enzymic active site at all pH values to produce binary enzyme-phosphoryl compound complexes, as indicated by inhibition data; (b) that assay pH does not discriminate between hydrolase and phosphotransferase activity of the enzyme, per se, since both types of activity are demonstrable at alkaline, as well as lower pH values with certain tested compounds; and (c) that pH discriminant effects (reactivity, or inhibition at high compared with lower pH values, or both) thus are dependent upon the nature of the phosphate substrate rather than the type of reaction involved. It is concluded, from these observations and a consideration of relevant earlier studies, that discrimination by assay pH with respect to the modes of reactivity of various phosphate compounds (ability to function as substrates and inhibitors as contrast with ability to function only as inhibitors) is manifest at an intermediate step in the over-all reaction mechanism, that involving the dissociation of binary enzyme-phosphoryl compound complexes to produce a phosphorylenzyme intermediate. The possible physiological implications of these observations are discussed briefly in terms of roles and regulation at pH 7 of activities of glucose 6-phosphatase, which may be under rigid metabolite control."
https://openalex.org/W1520435599,"Abstract A glucocerebroside was isolated from the yeast Hansenula ciferri. The cerebroside contained only a single sugar, d-glucose, and several species of sphingosine derivatives and fatty acids. Phytosphingosine was detected only in trace amounts in some preparations, and was absent in others, in spite of the fact that the yeast is known to produce substantial quantities of tetraacetylphytosphingosine. Preliminary characterization of the sphingosines in the glucocerebrosides showed that they differed from the sphingosines found in animal glucocerebrosides. The major fatty acids in the cerebrosides were C16 and C18 saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, and an α-hydroxy acid with the chromatographic properties of 2-hydroxystearic acid. Periodate oxidation indicated that the glucosyl group was linked to C-1 of the sphingosine moiety."
https://openalex.org/W1540209041,"Abstract Feedback inhibition by NAD was shown with the nicotinamidases of a number of microorganisms. The purified enzyme from Fleischmann's yeast was found to have a molecular weight of 110,000 and consist of presumably identical subunits with a molecular weight of 26,000. A Lineweaver-Burk plot of the NAD inhibition is concave upward at low concentrations of NAD; at 6 mm NAD, the linear plot is that of a competitive inhibitor with an apparent Ki of 7 x 10-4 m. Other competitive inhibitors include NMN (Ki = 6.5 x 10-5 m) and 3-acetylpyridine (Ki = 4.6 x 10-4 m). ADP, ADP-ribose, and PP-ribose-P were all noncompetitive inhibitors with Ki values of approximately 1 x 10-4 m. Inactivation of enzyme by urea can be prevented or partially reversed by the presence of NAD, NMN, or 3-acetylpyridine. The inactivation by urea was time-dependent and could be reversed by subsequent addition of substrate. p-Chloromercuribenzoate inhibition is competitive, with an apparent Ki of 2 x 10-7 m, and was reversed by dithiothreitol. The properties of the nicotinamidases of yeast and rabbit liver microsomes differ markedly."
https://openalex.org/W1528185180,"Abstract The methylation of DNA in organ cultures of mouse mammary gland has been studied during hormone-dependent cell proliferation and cell differentiation. Methionine-methyl-14C was incorporated into DNA, and 5-methylcytosine was the only methylated base found. Incubation of explants with insulin and other factors induced coordinate and proportional increases in the rates of DNA replication and methylation in the epithelial cells. DNA methylation was prevented by inhibitors of DNA synthesis. Density labeling of the DNA with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine demonstrated that the newly synthesized segments of DNA were methylated in these experiments. Induction of cell differentiation by insulin, hydrocortisone, and prolactin was not associated with alteration of the methylation of main or satellite DNA, and did not alter the formation of 5-methylcytosine-containing dipyrimidine sequences. These results indicate that DNA methylation has an obligatory dependence upon DNA synthesis, but is otherwise independent from the hormonal regulation of mammary cell differentiation."
https://openalex.org/W1531279286,"An enzyme capable of carrying out a trehalose-activated hydrolysis of glucose 6-phosphate has been purified 86-fold from whole body extracts of Phormia regina. By means of a number of criteria, it has been shown that the same enzyme is capable of activity against trehalose-6-P, although hydrolysis of the latter substrate is not activated by trehalose. It appears that the hydrolytic sites are overlapping but not identical, the overlap occurring at the phosphate-binding site, the sugar-binding sites being independent. The enzyme has a molecular weight of 25,000 to 26,000 and requires Mg2+ for hydrolysis of either substrate. The pH optimum for hydrolysis of glucose-6-P in the absence of trehalose is 7.0, in its presence, 6.0; the pH optimum for hydrolysis of trehalose-6-P is 6.0 to 6.5. The kinetics of activation of the glucose 6-phosphate site by trehalose indicates some active site interaction at low substrate concentration. The activation site cannot be destroyed by urea or heat denaturation without similarly injuring the hydrolytic sites. No other sugars tested have been found capable of replacing or interfering with trehalose activation. The net effect of trehalose appears to be an increase in the rate of product formation (increased kcat), thus an increase in the apparent Km."
https://openalex.org/W1584598905,"Abstract Cultured mammary cells, prepared from lactating rat mammary glands by treatment with collagenase, synthesize extensively cellular and secretory lipids, mostly triglycerides, from exogenous acetate or glucose via malonyl coenzyme A as an obligatory intermediate. Certain hypolipidemic drugs of clinical interest, which act as inhibitors of acetyl-CoA carboxylase in vitro drastically reduce lipogenesis in mammary cells from 1-14C-acetate or U-14C-glucose in a dose-dependent fashion. The effect is most pronounced in the triglyceride fraction of the cell lipids, but other lipid classes including cholesterol are also reduced. Production of 14CO2 and incorporation of radioactivity from 1-14C-acetate into nonlipid material, cellular or secretory, are unaffected by the presence of the drugs in the culture media. Lipogenic capacity of the cells utilizing 1,3-14C-malonyl-CoA is not altered by the drugs; thus the derangement of fatty acid synthesis occurs before malonyl-CoA formation. Exogenous citrate in the culture medium can, under certain conditions, prevent or reverse the drastic inhibition of lipogenesis caused by the hypolipidemic drugs. Competition of these structurally unrelated compounds at the cellular level is in agreement with the in vitro competition between the hypolipidemic drugs and citrate, the activator of acetyl-CoA carboxylase."
https://openalex.org/W1567520951,"Abstract Electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of single crystals of myoglobin fluoride and hemoglobin fluoride were recorded at both cryogenic and ambient temperatures. Analysis of angular variations of line widths at these temperatures indicates that the misorientation of the heme plane in myoglobin crystals, which is considered responsible for the unusually broad resonance lines in these crystals, is not an artifact of the freezing process, but a characteristic inherent to the protein crystals as they are grown. Single crystal electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy at ambient temperature opens the possibility of the determination of the intracrystalline orientation of the heme groups in other hemoprotein crystals, the structure of which is readily damaged upon freezing."
https://openalex.org/W1596805966,"Abstract The purified form of endonuclease I of Proteus mirabilis sediments as a 3 S molecule, requires Mg2+ for activity, and degrades double and single stranded DNA to acid-soluble products. This activity has an alkaline pH optimum and is inhibited by Escherichia coli tRNA and high concentrations of sodium chloride. The two faster sedimenting forms of the enzyme, 7.2 and 6 S, that can be generated by the addition of tRNA to the purified enzyme and also are found in a dihydrostreptomycin sulfate precipitate of a P. mirabilis crude extract, degrade the covalently closed circular duplex form of DNA of colicinogenic factor E1, φ X-174, and SV40 DNA to 8 S DNA fragments that are indistinguishable by sucrose gradient centrifugation analysis. Degradation of the supercoiled circular DNA to the 8 S product is independent of substrate concentration over a wide range and is not caused by inactivation of the enzyme under the reaction conditions used. The 8 S DNA product is double stranded, free of a substantial amount of nicks, and, once formed, is resistant to further endonuclease attack over a relatively long period of time under the conditions used. Evidence is presented for a single strand cleavage as the initial endonucleolytic event in the degradation of the native DNA substrate to the 8 S product."
