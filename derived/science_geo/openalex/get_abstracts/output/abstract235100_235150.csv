https://openalex.org/W1990869985,"THE presence of a polysaccharide resembling chondroitin sulphate in human dentine has already been described1. An undegraded polysaccharide with a low ash content has now been separated from human dentine. Dry human dentine (1 gm.) is reduced to a 180/200 mesh powder, then dialysed in 1 litre of 0.05 N hydrochloric acid for about ten days with frequent changes, at room temperature; this reduces the calcium content. When the outer fluid shows only a trace of calcium, pH of the suspension is brought to 6.0 and it is then heated to 80° for 20 min., as suggested by Partridge for cartilage2. The mass is then shaken with 10 per cent calcium chloride3 and again dialysed against distilled water. The bulk is then made up to about two litres with distilled water, and pH adjusted again to 6.0. Separation of protein is effected by shaking with 80 ml. chloroform and 32 ml. amyl alcohol to each litre. The bulk is then reduced by boiling at about 42° under reduced pressure; drying is completed over phosphorus pentoxide. The yield from 1 gm. dry dentine was 26.4 mgm. polysaccharide."
https://openalex.org/W1999326757,"THE range of techniques available for studying the denaturing and renaturing of proteins has recently been increased by the observation1 that a change from the extended (β) chain configuration of a synthetic polypeptide to the folded (α) form is accompanied by an increase in the frequency of the infra-red absorption band characteristic of the C = O peptide link. There is already evidence2 that some denaturing processes in proteins are accompanied by an unfolding of polypeptide chains, producing the extended β-form, and it seemed of interest to see if evidence on this point could be obtained from infra-red spectra."
https://openalex.org/W2064073578,"EARLY work1 gives a very confused picture of the reactions which occur in either alkaline or acid hydrolysis of organic esters of nitric acid. The only clearly established point is the occurrence of reactions other than simple fission to alcohol and nitric acid, and the general view was that such side-reactions, including the formation of nitrite, arise from subsequent oxidation of the alcohol by the nitric acid. A more recent study, by Lucas and Hammett2, of the solvolysis of tert.-butyl nitrate revealed the concomitant formation of isobutene, while with benzyl nitrate, benzaldehyde and nitrite are also formed."
https://openalex.org/W2032553252,"THE synthesis of iodotrifluoromethane and iodopentafluoroethane1 has opened up a route to the synthesis of organo-metallic compounds containing perfluoroalkyl groups. The mercurials CF3HgI and CF3CF2HgI have been prepared by the reaction of the fluoroiodides with mercury in the absence of a solvent2, and these may readily be converted into the corresponding dimercurials (for example, Hg(CF3)2)3. The reactions of iodotrifluoromethane with phosphorus, arsenic and sulphur have now been investigated and are found to yield organometallic compounds."

They are commonly seen as vitreous lumps on the bark, or as veins in the timber, of many eucalypts, and are locally known as ‘gums’. The kinos of certain eucalypts have been examined by the Williams and Kirby's solvent ascent modification1 of the paper partition chromatographic technique2."

https://openalex.org/W2035873935,"IN a recent discussion of oriented overgrowth, Sir George Thomson1 has pointed out that near equality of spacing of atoms in the two crystals in contact is not always a necessary condition for such growth to occur. It appeared that the presence of cracks or steps in the mother crystal plays an important part. Some evidence for this belief was the observation of Andrade and Martindale2 that small crystals of gold or silver grown on glass and diamonds show a preference for nucleation on cracks or scratches on the surface."
https://openalex.org/W2067086215,"THE name ‘huttonite’ is proposed for a newly recognized monoclinic mineral of the composition ThSiO4. It has been isolated in minute grains from beach sand of South Westland, New Zealand, by Prof. C. Osborne Hutton, of Stanford University. Its optical properties are: α= 1.898, β= 1.900, γ = 1.922; dispersion ρ > γ, moderate; 2V = 25° (measured); Y || b, Z near c; colourless to very pale cream. X-ray study by means of powder, rotation and Weissenberg patterns shows that huttonite is isostructural with monazite. Space group C2h5 – P21/n; a0 = 6.80A., b0 = 6.96A., c0 = 5.54A., β = 104° 55′. The measured density is 7.1 ±0.1. The calculated density, corresponding to a cell content of 4(ThSiO4), is 7.18."

Since the isolation of algæ has usually involved an enrichment in a mineral solution, which would select against species with organic growth-substance requirements, our present knowledge of algal physiology is strongly biased in favour of completely autotrophic forms."

https://openalex.org/W1970246950,"WE have recently investigated the synthesis of para-bridged benzene rings by dehydrogenation of maleic anhydride adducts of large ring dienes1. As this method is very laborious, we decided to find the lowest possible number of carbon atoms necessary to form a para-bridge starting from a preformed benzene ring, and then to use our dehydrogenation method systematically only for smaller bridges, which cannot be synthesized by ring closure. We have used the acyloin ring closure as described by Prelog and collaborators2, and cyclized the diester prepared according to Ruzicka and collaborators3 from pure p-xylene. Surprisingly, we obtained the acyloin in 70 per cent yield (b.p. 150–160°, 0.3 mm. mercury). After standing in the icebox, it solidified to a very low-melting crystalline solid (found: C, 78.07; H, 8.93; calculated for C16H22O2; C, 78.01; H, 9.00 per cent). In alcohol with platinum oxide, this compound took up one mole of hydrogen and the corresponding diol was obtained (m.p. 102–103°; found: C, 77.39; H, 9.73 per cent; calculated for C16H24O2: C, 77.37; H, 9.74 per cent). The diol consumed the theoretical amount of periodic acid. The high yield of the pure acyloin is interesting, as under identical conditions the cyclization reaction gives a yield of only 58 per cent cyclotetradecoin. It seems that the shortest para-bridge will have less than ten and more than six carbons, which is the length of the shortest bridge in the meta-position4."

https://openalex.org/W1966232156,"DICUMAROL1 is widely used clinically for the treatment of thrombosis. Since very little is known about the mechanism whereby dicumarol lowers the prothrombin-level in blood2, it was thought that experiments with dicumarol labelled with carbon-14 might be of value. The dicumarol was prepared by adding an aqueous solution of formaldehyde containing carbon-14, obtained from the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, to a saturated aqueous solution of 4-hydroxycoumarin3. The 3,3′-methylene-C14-bis(4-hydroxycoumarin) so obtained had a specific activity of 6 × 104 counts per minute per milligram, when measured with an end-window type of Geiger–Müller counter and a scale of 128."

https://openalex.org/W1999243047,"RECENTLY, Heim and Poe in the United States introduced a very convenient method for evaluating antimicrobial properties of organic compounds1. They used, for example, Aerobacter aerogenes and Saccharomyces cerevisiœ as test strains, and based the estimation on the volume of gas found on incubation in lactose and glucose broth respectively for 72 hr. or less at 37° C. We have applied the same principle as a convenient method for estimating fermentation-inhibiting properties."
https://openalex.org/W2008897187,"A COMMUNICATION1 on the above topic has just come to our attention, in which the authors have reasoned from some frequency calculations to the conclusion that cyclo-octatetraene probably has the D4d structure, with the D4 structure a less likely possibility. It is the purpose of the present note to point out that the vibrational spectra2 of the deuterium derivative of cyclo-octatetraene, published some time ago, enable the method of reasoning as well as the D4d conclusion to be refuted."
https://openalex.org/W2080215686,"WEST POINT ISLAND lies off the north-west corner of west Falkland and only about a quarter of a mile off-shore. It has been occupied as a small sheep farm for many years, and like everyone else in the Falklands the people of the Island burn peat. The peatbog, that is the place whence the peat is brought, is situated near the upper end of a valley, roughly one and a half miles long and half a mile wide, which runs up from sea-level at the north to the top of a steep cliff at the south end. The area covered by the peat bog lies at an altitude of approximately 600 ft. It has been worked over by the removal of successive layers of one yard in thickness; in some places three such layers have been extracted, and beneath the lowest, that is, at a depth of nine feet from the original surface, a bone deposit was discovered some fifteen or twenty years ago."
