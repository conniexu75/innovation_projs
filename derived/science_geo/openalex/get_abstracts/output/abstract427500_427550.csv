https://openalex.org/W2068854025,"Although underexpression of miR-9 in cancer cells is reported in many cancer types, it is currently difficult to classify miR-9 as a tumor suppressor or an oncomir. We demonstrate that miR-9 expression is down-regulated in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells compared with MCF-10-2A normal breast cell line. Increasing miR-9 expression levels in breast cancer cells induced anti-proliferative, anti-invasive, and pro-apoptotic activity. In addition, microarray profiling of the transcriptome of MCF-7 cells overexpressing miR-9 identified six novel direct miR-9 targets (AP3B1, CCNG1, LARP1, MTHFD1L, MTHFD2, and SRPK1). Among these, MTHFD2 was identified as a miR-9 target gene that affects cell proliferation. Knockdown of MTHFD2 mimicked the effect observed when miR-9 was overexpressed by decreasing cell viability and increasing apoptotic activity. Despite variable effects on different cell lines, proliferative and anti-apoptotic activity of MTHFD2 was demonstrated whereby it could escape from miR-9-directed suppression (by overexpression of MTHFD2 with mutated miR-9 binding sites). Furthermore, endogenous expression levels of miR-9 and MTHFD2 displayed inverse expression profiles in primary breast tumor samples compared with normal breast samples; miR-9 was down-regulated, and MTHFD2 was up-regulated. These results indicate anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity of miR-9 and that direct targeting of MTHFD2 can contribute to tumor suppressor-like activity of miR-9 in breast cancer cells."

A major consequence of up-regulated glycolysis is the increased production of metabolic acids responsible for the presence of acidic areas within solid tumors. Tumor acidosis is an important determinant of tumor progression and tumor pH regulation is being investigated as a therapeutic target. Autophagy is a cellular catabolic pathway leading to lysosomal degradation and recycling of proteins and organelles, currently considered an important survival mechanism in cancer cells under metabolic stress or subjected to chemotherapy. We investigated the response of human melanoma cells cultured in acidic conditions in terms of survival and autophagy regulation. Melanoma cells exposed to acidic culture conditions (7.0 < pH < 6.2) promptly accumulated LC3+ autophagic vesicles. Immunoblot analysis showed a consistent increase of LC3-II in acidic culture conditions as compared with cells at normal pH. Inhibition of lysosomal acidification by bafilomycin A1 further increased LC3-II accumulation, suggesting an active autophagic flux in cells under acidic stress. Acute exposure to acidic stress induced rapid inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway detected by decreased phosphorylation of p70S6K and increased phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase, associated with decreased ATP content and reduced glucose and leucine uptake. Inhibition of autophagy by knockdown of the autophagic gene ATG5 consistently reduced melanoma cell survival in low pH conditions. These observations indicate that induction of autophagy may represent an adaptation mechanism for cancer cells exposed to an acidic environment. Our data strengthen the validity of therapeutic strategies targeting tumor pH regulation and autophagy in progressive malignancies.

Our data strengthen the validity of therapeutic strategies targeting tumor pH regulation and autophagy in progressive malignancies. The tumor microenvironment represents a complex physical and biochemical environment characterizing solid cancers. It has received renewed attention after the established association between signaling through oncogenic mutations and their role as drivers of metabolic transformation (1Cairns R.A. Harris I.S. Mak T.W. Regulation of cancer cell metabolism.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2011; 11: 85-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (3574) Google Scholar). Highly proliferating cancer cells create a tumor mass poor in nutrients and oxygen because of the growing distance from blood vessels. As a consequence of low oxygen tension, the stabilization of the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor 1α represent an important process regulating the shift to glycolytic metabolism (2Chiche J. Brahimi-Horn M.C. Pouysségur J. Tumor hypoxia induces a metabolic shift causing acidosis. A common feature in cancer.J. Cell Mol. Med. 2010; 14: 771-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). In cancer cells, glucose is metabolized to pyruvate and lactate rather than entering the oxidative phosphorylation pathway, even in normal oxygen pressure, giving rise to the Warburg effect (3Warburg O. On the origin of cancer cells.Science. 1956; 123: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (9620) Google Scholar). An inevitable result of up-regulated glucose metabolism is the high production rate of metabolic acids (lactate and protons) that cells need to extrude to avoid intracellular acidification. Normally, to maintain pH homeostasis cancer cells increase the activity and/or expression of several pH regulators, resulting in alkalinization of intracellular pH (pHi) 2The abbreviations used are: pHiintracellular pHpHeextracellular pH2-NBDG2-(N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)amino)-2-deoxyglucosemTORmammalian target of rapamycinAMPKAMP-activated protein kinaseBCECF-AM2′,7′-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and -6)-carboxyfluoresceinEBSSEarle's balanced salt solution. and acidification of extracellular pH (pHe) (4Gatenby R.A. Gillies R.J. Why do cancers have high aerobic glycolysis?.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 891-899Crossref PubMed Scopus (3711) Google Scholar). A low tumor pHe has been demonstrated in several preclinical models of human cancers, with a pHe ranging from 5.9 to 7.2 depending on the tumor type. Additionally, tumors have localized areas characterized by spatial variations in pHe (5Gillies R.J. Robey I. Gatenby R.A. Causes and consequences of increased glucose metabolism of cancers.J. Nucl. Med. 2008; 49: 24S-42SCrossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). The acidic pH of the tumor microenvironment is an important component driving tumor invasive capacity, neoangiogenesis, anchorage-independent growth, and genetic instability, which in combination contribute to malignant progression (5Gillies R.J.

Moreover, low tumor pHe is a known factor responsible for the intrinsic resistance of malignant cells to chemotherapeutics (9De Milito A. Fais S.

Recently, it was reported that the long-term culture of glioma cells in medium at pH 6.5 induces a stem cell phenotype (12Hjelmeland A.B. Wu Q. Heddleston J.M. Choudhary G.S. MacSwords J. Lathia J.D.

Therefore, anticancer therapies based on targeting tumor pH regulation and inducing alkalinization of tumor pHe may inhibit several tumor biological functions and are currently under investigation both in preclinical and clinical settings (13Fais S.

Macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is a catabolic process used by eukaryotic cells to recycle long lived proteins, lipids, and eliminate protein aggregates and organelles (18Mehrpour M.

A history of macroautophagy.Nat. Cell Biol. 2010; 12: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (1648) Google Scholar). The process starts by the formation of a double membrane-bound autophagosome dependent on the sequential intervention of ATG (AuTophaGy-related) proteins (20Mizushima N. Komatsu M. Autophagy.

In most of the cases the final destination of the autophagosome is fusion with the lysosomal compartment where sequestered cargo is degraded.

The double-edged sword of autophagy modulation in cancer.Clin. Cancer Res. 2009; 15: 5308-5316Crossref PubMed Scopus (893) Google Scholar). Autophagy has a complex role in tumor development and progression. Autophagy is a tumor suppressor pathway at the initiation stage of tumors by limiting the production of reactive oxygen species and limiting DNA damage (29White E. DiPaola R.S.

However, autophagy is a survival pathway for tumor cells to overcome metabolic stress and to resist cell death in response to radiation and chemotherapeutic agents (32Mathew R. White E.

Autophagy plays a major role in metabolic adaptation in RAS-transformed cells (36Guo J.Y. Chen H.Y. Mathew R. Fan J. Strohecker A.M. Karsli-Uzunbas G. Kamphorst J.J. Chen G. Lemons J.M. Karantza V.

Pancreatic cancers require autophagy for tumor growth.Genes Dev. 2011; 25: 717-729Crossref PubMed Scopus (1076) Google Scholar). Thus, autophagy has a fundamental and driving role in developing tumors and their malignant progression. Notably, recent studies performed on tissue sections of human tumors suggest the association of up-regulated autophagy with tumor hypoxia and acidity (38Giatromanolaki A. Koukourakis M.I. Harris A.L. Polychronidis A. Gatter K.C. Sivridis E. Prognostic relevance of light chain 3 (LC3A) autophagy patterns in colorectal adenocarcinomas.J. Clin.

In the present study we evaluated the effects of acidic pH on the autophagic activity in human malignant melanoma cells. We demonstrate that exposure to acidic pH inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and reduced glucose and leucine uptake. Melanoma cells under acidic stress up-regulate the autophagic flux and gene knockdown experiments showed that functional autophagy, intended as an active autophagic flux is instrumental for melanoma cells to survive acidic stress. We propose that the ability to maintain functional autophagy may characterize melanoma cells exposed to an acidic microenvironment, conferring malignant cells the capacity to overcome acidic stress-induced cell death. Bafilomycin A1 (Baf) and E64d were from Sigma. Antibiotics, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), trypsin/EDTA, and fetal bovine serum (FBS) were from Lonza (Milano, Italy). Pepstatin A and FuGENE 6 Transfection Reagent were from Roche Applied Science. HiPerFect Transfection Reagent was from Qiagen.

The GFP-LC3 and GFP-RFP-LC3 plasmids were a kind gift of Dr. Tamotsu Yoshimori (National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan). Cell lines Me30966, Mel501, and WM793 were described before (41De Milito A. Canese R. Marino M.L. Borghi M. Iero M. Villa A. Venturi G. Lozupone F. Iessi E. Logozzi M. Della Mina P. Santinami M. Rodolfo M. Podo F. Rivoltini L. Fais S. pH-dependent antitumor activity of proton pump inhibitors against human melanoma is mediated by inhibition of tumor acidity.Int. J. Cancer. 2010; 127: 207-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The cell lines A375 and SK-Mel-28 were a kind gift from Johan Hansson (Karolinska Institute, Sweden). All cell lines were maintained in RPMI medium in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and antibiotics at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The different pH of RPMI media were obtained by adding different concentrations of NaHCO3 and letting the medium equilibrate in the cell culture incubator overnight. Growth curves of cell lines at different pH conditions were performed using the acid phosphatase assay. Briefly, cells were plated in standard RPMI medium in 96-well plates the day after medium was replaced with media at the indicated pH. Starting from time 0 the plates were collected every 24 h and the acid phosphatase assay was run as previously described (42Yang T.T. Sinai P. Kain S.R. An acid phosphatase assay for quantifying the growth of adherent and nonadherent cells.Anal. Biochem. 1996; 241: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Melanoma cells cultured at different pH conditions were incubated with 100 μm 2-NBDG, a fluorescent derivative of 2-deoxy-d-glucose, for 45 min. Cells were collected and washed with PBS and then analyzed by flow cytometry to collect green fluorescence. Cytosolic pH was evaluated by fluorescence spectroscopy using the pH-sensitive fluorescent probe BCECF-AM as previously described (43Grant R.L. Acosta D. Ratiometric measurement of intracellular pH of cultured cells with BCECF in a fluorescence multiwell plate reader.In Vitro Cell Dev. Biol. Anim. 1997; 33: 256-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were plated in black 96-well plates (Costar) at 50% confluence. The next day, cells were incubated for 30 min with 10 μm BCECF-AM in isotonic saline solution (ISS: 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4), washed once in ISS, and incubated for an additional 20 min. Immediately after exposing cells to ISS at different pH values, BCECF fluorescence was recorded at 530 nm after excitation at 445 and 495 nm, in a Tecan Infinite M1000 (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland) fluorescence microplate reader. After background subtraction, the fluorescence ratio of BCECF-AM (495/445) was converted to pHi values by using a calibration curve with different potassium phosphate buffers in a pH range of 6.0 to 8.0 in the presence of 10 μm nigericin. Cells were incubated in RPMI buffered at different pH values (7.4 or 6.5). After 2 h [3H]leucine was added (1 μCi/ml) and incubated for 2 h. As positive control, we used C2-ceramide (C2-Cer, 50 μm), which is known to inhibit amino acids uptake (44Guenther G.G. Peralta E.R. Rosales K.R. Wong S.Y. Siskind L.J. Edinger A.L. Ceramide starves cells to death by down-regulating nutrient transporter proteins.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 17402-17407Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Cells were washed twice with ice-cold RPMI, lysed in RIPA buffer, and tritium levels were determined by scintillation counting. Quantification of cellular ATP was performed on cells cultured in 96-well plates using the ATP assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI). Cells were plated at 5000 cells/well and the ATP concentration was normalized to the cell number. Cells were collected and treated with RIPA buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors and protein concentration of cellular extracts was determined by Bio-Rad Protein Assay (Bio-Rad). SDS-PAGE was performed on pre-casted acrylamide gels (12–15%) using the NuPage system and loading 30 μg of proteins per lane. After electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in TBS-Tween with 5% nonfat dry milk. Protein loading was assessed by red Ponceau staining of the membranes. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in TBS-Tween overnight at 4 °C, followed by appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies. Antibody staining was visualized by the ECL system (Pierce). Me30966 cells were used to monitor GFP-LC3 fluorescence under different pH culture conditions. Twenty-four hours after plating the cells were transfected with the peGFP-LC3 plasmid by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). The next day, the medium was replaced with freshly prepared medium at a different pH. After an 8-h incubation with different pH media, the cells were fixed using 2% paraformaldehyde and autophagy was determined by microscopy fluorescence and quantification of the number of cells containing GFP-LC3-positive vesicles. Small interfering RNAs (siRNA) for ATG5 were synthesized by Dharmacon RNA Technologies (siGENOME SMART pool). For siRNA transfection, Me30966 and WM793 cells were seeded in standard RPMI medium at 30% confluence in 12-well tissue culture plates. The next day cells were transfected with 20 nm siRNA specific for ATG5 by using Hi-Perfect transfection reagent (Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The gene-silencing efficacy was assessed by Western blot analysis of ATG5 protein expression using polyclonal antibodies. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the medium was replaced with medium at different pH values (7.4, 6.5, and 6.2) or with EBSS. Twenty-four hours after being exposed to the new media cells were collected and evaluated for cell death using Annexin-V-FITC and propidium iodide staining (BD Pharmingen). An acidic pH environment is known to delay cell growth and increase spontaneous apoptosis in cell lines derived from colon cancer and malignant glioma (45Reichert M. Steinbach J.P. Supra P. Weller M.

However, human melanoma cells are known to survive during acidic stress (41De Milito A. Canese R. Marino M.L. Borghi M. Iero M. Villa A. Venturi G. Lozupone F. Iessi E. Logozzi M. Della Mina P.

We cultured Me30966, WM793, A375, SK-Mel-28, and Mel501 cells at different pH conditions and evaluated cell proliferation over 72 h. As indicated in Fig. 1, melanoma cells cultured at pH 6.8 showed a reduction of 20–50% in proliferation as compared with cells cultured at pH 7.4, depending on the cell line. Interestingly, all cell lines cultured at pH 6.5 continue to slowly proliferate. Acute exposure to the pH 6.5 medium seemed to provoke a low degree of cell death (supplemental Fig. S1A) followed by recovery of proliferation of the surviving cells (Fig. 1A and supplemental Fig. S1B). Among the cell lines analyzed, Me30966 showed the highest ability to grow even at pH 6.5 as compared with other cell lines (Fig. 1, supplemental Fig. S1C), thus representing an appropriate model to study how melanoma cells adapt to survive and proliferate in very acidic conditions. Increased autophagy linked to acidity has recently been reported as a marker of poor prognosis in melanoma and colorectal cancer (38Giatromanolaki A. Koukourakis M.I. Harris A.L. Polychronidis A.

Moreover, increased autophagy was shown to represent a marker for aggressive and metastatic melanoma (48Ma X.H. Piao S. Wang D. McAfee Q.W. Nathanson K.L. Lum J.J. Li L.Z. Amaravadi R.K. Measurements of tumor cell autophagy predict invasiveness, resistance to chemotherapy, and survival in melanoma.Clin. Cancer Res. 2011; 17: 3478-3489Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). Because autophagy is activated in cells under metabolic stress, we hypothesized that autophagy might be a protective mechanism for cancer cells acutely exposed to acidic stress. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the effects of short-term exposure to acidic pH on basal autophagy in human melanoma cells. We used the human melanoma cell line Me30966 transiently transfected with a GFP-LC3 expressing plasmid. The day after transfection the cell culture medium was replaced with medium at different pH values (7.4 to 5.5) and GFP-LC3 fluorescence was monitored 8 h later. As depicted in Fig. 2A, cells cultured at neutral pH showed a mostly cytosolic distribution of GFP-LC3 fluorescence and around 30 LC3-positive dots/cell. With decreasing pHe, the number of LC3-positive dots per cells significantly increased 2-fold from about 30 LC3+ dots/cell at pH 7.4 to over 70 LC3+ dots/cell at low pH (p < 0.05, Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that acidic culture conditions increase the number of autophagic vacuoles. The number of LC3+ autophagic vesicles per cell was significantly higher at pH 6.5 with respect to pH 7.0 (p < 0.05) and reached a plateau at pH 6.5 (Fig. 2B). To gain insight into the effects of acidic stress on basal autophagy we first cultured Me30966 cells in media at different pH values and analyzed the conversion of LC3-I into LC3-II after 8 h. Interestingly, the LC3-II form was significantly increased as the medium pH decreased (Fig. 2C). p62 is a cytoplasmic protein that shuttles ubiquitinated proteins to autophagosomes. Expression of p62 increases when autophagy is inhibited, thus the levels of p62 may reflect"
https://openalex.org/W2009181661,"Inteins excise themselves out of precursor proteins by the protein splicing reaction and have emerged as valuable protein engineering tools in numerous and diverse biotechnological applications. Split inteins have recently attracted particular interest because of the opportunities associated with generating a protein from two separate polypeptides and with trans-cleavage applications made possible by split intein mutants. However, natural split inteins are rare and differ greatly in their usefulness with regard to the achievable rates and yields. Here we report the first functional characterization of new split inteins previously identified by bioinformatics from metagenomic sources. The N- and C-terminal fragments of the four inteins gp41-1, gp41-8, NrdJ-1, and IMPDH-1 were prepared as fusion constructs with model proteins. Upon incubation of complementary pairs, we observed trans-splicing reactions with unprecedented rates and yields for all four inteins. Furthermore, no side reactions were detectable, and the precursor constructs were consumed virtually quantitatively. The rate for the gp41-1 intein, the most active intein on all accounts, was k = 1.8 ± 0.5 × 10−1 s−1, which is ∼10-fold faster than the rate reported for the Npu DnaE intein and gives rise to completed reactions within 20–30 s. No cross-reactivity in exogenous combinations was observed. Using C1A mutants, all inteins were efficient in the C-terminal cleavage reaction, albeit at lower rates. C-terminal cleavage could be performed under a wide range of reaction conditions and also in the absence of native extein residues flanking the intein. Thus, these inteins hold great potential for splicing and cleavage applications.

Thus, these inteins hold great potential for splicing and cleavage applications. Inteins, a combination of the words “internal protein” (1.Perler F.B. Davis E.O. Dean G.E. Gimble F.S. Jack W.E. Neff N. Noren C.J. Thorner J. Belfort M. Protein splicing elements: inteins and exteins: a definition of terms and recommended nomenclature.Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1125-1127Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), were first discovered in 1990 when it was observed that the translation of the VMA1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae did not result in the predicted 120-kDa protein, but a much shorter polypeptide chain of 69 kDa (2.Hirata R. Ohsumk Y. Nakano A. Kawasaki H. Suzuki K. Anraku Y. Molecular structure of a gene, VMA1, encoding the catalytic subunit of H+-translocating adenosine triphosphatase from vacuolar membranes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6726-6733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To obtain the mature 69-kDa protein, an internal part of the larger precursor had to be excised and the flanking regions, called N- and C-extein, rejoined in an autocatalytic post-translational process termed protein splicing. Furthermore, the excised intein fragment contained a nonessential part exhibiting homing endonuclease activity that could be deleted without affecting the overall ability of the mini-intein to cleave and splice (3.Kane P.M. Yamashiro C.T. Wolczyk D.F. Neff N. Goebl M. Stevens T.H. Protein splicing converts the yeast TFP1 gene product to the 69-kDa subunit of the vacuolar H+-adenosine triphosphatase.Science. 1990; 250: 651-657Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). More recently, inteins without the endonuclease domain have also been found (4.Telenti A. Southworth M. Alcaide F. Daugelat S. Jacobs Jr., W.R. Perler F.B. The Mycobacterium xenopi GyrA protein splicing element: characterization of a minimal intein.J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 6378-6382Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Since that time, almost 500 other inteins have been identified in the three kingdoms of organisms (archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes), and their sequences have been collected in a dedicated database (5.Perler F.B. InBase: the Intein Database.Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 383-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Overall, four short conserved regions on the amino terminus and two conserved domains on the carboxyl terminus could be identified that can be used to search for novel inteins (1.Perler F.B. Davis E.O. Dean G.E. Gimble F.S. Jack W.E. Neff N. Noren C.J. Thorner J. Belfort M.

Modular organization of inteins and C-terminal autocatalytic domains.Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 64-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Besides the inteins that are encoded in a single gene, a few split inteins were also discovered and characterized biochemically that are transcribed and translated from two separate genes and lack the endonuclease domain. These include a number of alleles inserted in the cyanobacterial DnaE gene encoding the α subunit of DNA polymerase (7.Dassa B. Amitai G. Caspi J. Schueler-Furman O. Pietrokovski S. trans-Protein splicing of cyanobacterial split inteins in endogenous and exogenous combinations.Biochemistry. 2007; 46: 322-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), such as Npu DnaE (8.Iwai H.

Biol. 2006; 356: 1093-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, the translation of both fragments reconstitutes the catalytic activity of protein trans-splicing to form the mature protein (12.Martin D.D. Xu M.Q. Evans Jr., T.C.

Split inteins can also be generated artificially by dividing inteins into two or three fragments (13.Sun W. Yang J. Liu X..

In the case of the Ssp DnaB intein, the N-terminal intein fragment (IntN) 3The abbreviations used are: IntNintein-NIntCintein-C5aaNnative extein-N5aaCnative extein-CSTStrep-tag IIgpDbacteriophage λ head protein DTrxthioredoxinH6His tagSPsplice productIMPDHinosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenaseBis-Tris2-(bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol. could be as short as 11 amino acids (14.Ludwig C.

Because inteins are in principle tolerant with regard to heterologous sequences at their flanking extein regions, they can be inserted into other proteins. This opens the door for many applications, for instance, to generate cyclic peptides (16.Tavassoli A. Benkovic S.J. Split intein-mediated circular ligation used in the synthesis of cyclic peptide libraries in E. coli.Nat. Protoc. 2007; 2: 1126-1133Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), to generate protein thioesters (17.Muralidharan V. Muir T.W. Protein ligation: an enabling technology for the biophysical analysis of proteins.Nat. Methods. 2006; 3: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), to label proteins (18.Volkmann G. Iwaï H.

Split inteins as versatile tools for protein semisynthesis.Chembiochem. 2009; 10: 2579-2589Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), and probably most frequently, to cleave off affinity tags for protein purification (20.Wu W.Y. Mee C. Califano F. Banki R. Wood D.W. Recombinant protein purification by self-cleaving aggregation tag.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 2257-2262Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Particularly to optimize cleavage efficiency, inteins have been mutagenized to become inducible by pH (21.Mathys S. Evans T.C. Chute I.C. Wu H. Chong S. Benner J. Liu X.Q. Xu M.Q. Characterization of a self-splicing mini-intein and its conversion into autocatalytic N- and C-terminal cleavage elements: facile production of protein building blocks for protein ligation.Gene. 1999; 231: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), reducing agents (22.Chong S.

Chen M. Foote C. Tan C. Temperature-sensitive mutations made easy: generating conditional mutations by using temperature-sensitive inteins that function within different temperature ranges.Genetics. 2009; 183: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and to separate cleavage activity from splicing. Interestingly, inteins can be engineered to cut either at the amino terminus (22.Chong S. Mersha F.B. Comb D.G. Scott M.E. Landry D. Vence L.M. Perler F.B. Benner J. Kucera R.B. Hirvonen C.A. Pelletier J.J. Paulus H. Xu M.Q. Single-column purification of free recombinant proteins using a self-cleavable affinity tag derived from a protein splicing element.Gene. 1997; 192: 271-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (505) Google Scholar) or at the carboxyl terminus (24.Chong S. Montello G.E. Zhang A. Cantor E.J. Liao W. Xu M.Q. Benner J. Utilizing the C-terminal cleavage activity of a protein splicing element to purify recombinant proteins in a single chromatographic step.Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 5109-5115Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Many of the artificial split inteins require refolding or show low solubility in fusion constructs, which limits their application. However, split inteins are especially attractive for biotechnological applications because they have no premature activity when expressed separately and they are much smaller than normal inteins and thus potentially have less negative impact on the expression level of the fused target protein (25.Volkmann G. Sun W. Liu X.Q. Controllable protein cleavages through intein fragment complementation.Protein Sci. 2009; 18: 2393-2402Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The ideal intein for some biotechnical applications would therefore be a split intein that is highly active without the need of refolding. Currently, the Npu DnaE intein appears to be the most advantageous split intein as it displays superior splicing kinetics and high efficiency (8.Iwai H. Züger S. Jin J. Tam P.H. Highly efficient protein trans-splicing by a naturally split DnaE intein from Nostoc punctiforme.FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 1853-1858Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 26.Zettler J. Schütz V. Mootz H.D. The naturally split Npu DnaE intein exhibits an extraordinarily high rate in the protein trans-splicing reaction.FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 909-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). After the first isolation of naturally occurring split inteins, efforts were undertaken to find more native split inteins. Most recently, a search in Global Ocean Sampling (GOS) environmental metagenomic sequence data was performed to find fractured genes that contain novel split inteins (27.Dassa B. London N. Stoddard B.L. Schueler-Furman O. Pietrokovski S. Fractured genes: a novel genomic arrangement involving new split inteins and a new homing endonuclease family.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 2560-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). These fractured genes code for potentially essential cellular proteins, and in the case of four insertion sites (gp41 DNA helicase, inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), ribonucleotide reductase catalytic subunit NrdJ, and DnaE polymerase II subunit α), the complete loci including the split inteins could be assembled. However, it remained unclear whether the inteins were active in protein trans-splicing. The purpose of this study was to functionally characterize four representatives of these novel hypothetical split inteins (gp41-1, gp41-8, NrdJ-1, and IMPDH-1) in the protein trans-splicing reaction and to perform mutagenesis to evaluate their efficiency and applicability for trans-cleavage. We found that these inteins exhibit an unprecedented activity in terms of reaction speed and efficiency. Gene sequences and specific details of novel split inteins gp41-1, gp41-8, NrdJ-1, and IMPDH-1 are already described elsewhere (27.Dassa B. London N. Stoddard B.L. Schueler-Furman O. Pietrokovski S. Fractured genes: a novel genomic arrangement involving new split inteins and a new homing endonuclease family.Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 2560-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Gene synthesis of split intein fragments was performed by Biomatik (Cambridge, Canada), including flanking restriction sites for easy subcloning into the previously described pAU08 and pVS01 plasmids (26.Zettler J. Schütz V. Mootz H.D. The naturally split Npu DnaE intein exhibits an extraordinarily high rate in the protein trans-splicing reaction.FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 909-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Construction of the expression plasmids encoding the IntN fragments of gp41-1, gp41-8, NrdJ-1, and IMPDH-1 together with their 5 native extein residues (5aaN) was accomplished by BamHI and HindIII restriction digestion (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) and by their subcloning into pAU08 to replace the Npu DnaEN; an ST-gpD sequence is encoded upstream of the IntN fragments. The four generated expression plasmids were named as follows: gp41-1N, gp41-8N, NrdJ-1N, and IMPDH-1N. Plasmids encoding the IntC split intein fragments of gp41-1, gp41-8, NrdJ-1, and IMPDH-1 together with their 5 native extein residues (5aaC) were obtained by KpnI and NdeI (Fermentas, St. Leon-Rot, Germany) restriction digestion and by their subcloning into pVS01 to replace the Npu DnaEC; a Trx-His tag sequence is downstream of the IntC fragments. The four generated expression plasmids were named as follows: gp41-1C, gp41-8C, NrdJ-1C, and IMPDH-1C. Single-point mutation to allow C-terminal cleavage was performed in constructs containing the IntN fragments. A C1A mutation for each split intein was performed by PCR using specific primers to give gp41-1N(C1A), gp41-8N(C1A), NrdJ-1N(C1A), and IMPDH-1N(C1A). Synthetic oligonucleotides were obtained from Thermo Scientific (Ulm, Germany). To permit a clean C-terminal cleavage, 5aaC residues placed between the IntC and the thioredoxin (Trx) encoding gene sequence were removed by PCR using specific primers to give gp41-1C(Δext), gp41-8C(Δext), NrdJ-1C(Δext), and IMPDH-1C(Δext). All plasmids were verified by DNA sequencing (Macrogen).

Open table in a new tab All generated plasmids were used for transformation of Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Stratagene). Cells were grown at 37 °C and 250 rpm in shake flasks containing 600 ml of LB medium supplemented with the corresponding plasmid maintenance antibiotics (50 μg/ml kanamycin or 100 μg/ml ampicillin), until A600 nm reached ∼0.6. Induction of gene expression was then triggered by the addition of 0.4 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for the IntN constructs or by the addition of 0.02% l-arabinose for the IntC constructs; in both cases, the temperature was lowered to 28 °C. After a 5-h induction, cells were harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 5000 rpm, and the cell pellet was stored at −80 °C. Protein purification was always performed under native conditions. For the IntN constructs, the cell pellet was resuspended in buffer containing 100 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA. For the IntC constructs, cells were resuspended in buffer containing 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole. Cells were sonicated on ice for 20 min with a 30% pulsed activity cycle (Branson 250 Sonifier) and centrifuged for 30 min at 34,500 × g at 4 °C. The soluble fraction of IntN fusion proteins was purified on Strep-Tactin columns (IBA, Göttingen, Germany), whereas soluble IntC constructs were purified on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (IBA) columns following the manufacturer's instructions. Eluted fractions containing the purified fusion proteins were pooled, dialyzed against splicing buffer (50 mm Tris/HCl at pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol) in the presence of 2 mm DTT, and stored in aliquots at −80 °C. Protein concentration was determined using the calculated absorbance at 280 nm. In vitro reactions were performed basically as previously described (12.Martin D.D. Xu M.Q. Evans Jr., T.C.

In brief, purified N- and C-fusion proteins were shortly preincubated separately in the corresponding testing conditions. Protein splicing and C-terminal cleavage reactions were started by mixing complementary N- and C-fusion proteins in splicing buffer or different buffer conditions as indicated at equimolar concentrations of 5 μm and incubating at different temperatures. Aliquots were removed at specific time intervals, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer containing 8% SDS (w/v) and 20% β-mercaptoethanol (v/v) followed by boiling. For reactions carried out in the presence of different urea concentrations or at different pH values, proteins were first dialyzed against the corresponding buffer. All reactions were monitored by SDS-PAGE (4–12% Bis-Tris gels from Novex, Invitrogen) followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Sigma) staining. Relative intensities of protein bands were determined densitometrically using the Quantity One (Bio-Rad) program. The different splicing/cleavage products were normalized according to their corresponding molecular weight. The percentage of protein splicing was calculated from the ratio of the splice product and the most consumed precursor. Constant rates (kobs) were determined using the GraFit software (Erithacus, Surrey, UK), by fitting the data to the equation P = P0(1 − e−kt), where P is the percentage of splice product formation at time t, P0 is the maximum percentage of spliced product obtained (yield), and k is the observed rate (12.Martin D.D.

All reactions were treated as irreversible, presteady-state first-order processes under the assumption that after a fast association of the two complementary fragments, protein trans-splicing or self-cleavage proceeded like a monomolecular reaction. The four split inteins gp41-1, gp41-8, NrdJ-1, and IMPDH-1 were prepared as IntN and IntC fusion partners for the in vitro analysis. As shown in Fig. 1B, all the fusion proteins contained the sequence of bacteriophage λ head protein D (gpD) and thioredoxin (Trx) as N- and C-exteins, respectively. Strep-tag II (ST) and/or His tag (H6) were added for purification purposes. Five native extein amino acids (5aa) were kept upstream and downstream of the IntN and IntC fragments. Additionally, the non-native amino acid sequence GS upstream of the native ExteinN residues and GT downstream of the native ExteinC residues were added due to cloning reasons (Table 1). All proteins were expressed in soluble form in E. coli and purified under native conditions. The Npu DnaE intein, considered to have the highest splicing rate yet described, was used as a control in this study with previously described constructs (26.Zettler J. Schütz V. Mootz H.D. The naturally split Npu DnaE intein exhibits an extraordinarily high rate in the protein trans-splicing reaction.FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 909-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar) that exhibit equivalent fusion protein design (Fig. 1B and Table 1). Protein splicing is a self-processing pathway mediated by the intein domain. In the most common class I inteins (28.Tori K. Dassa B. Johnson M.A. Southworth M.W. Brace L.E. Ishino Y. Pietrokovski S. Perler F.B. Splicing of the mycobacteriophage Bethlehem DnaB intein: identification of a new mechanistic class of inteins that contain an obligate block F nucleophile.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 2515-2526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), four successive nucleophilic displacement reactions that directly involve the side chain functional groups of three of the four splice junction residues lead to intein excision with concomitant ligation of the N- and C-terminal exteins. In protein trans-splicing, this pathway is preceded by intein fragment association, as depicted in Fig. 1A. Purified IntN fusions (proteins 1–5 in Table 1) and IntC fusions (proteins 6–10 in Table 1) were mixed in pairwise combinations in a 1:1 stoichiometry. For each intein, the spontaneous trans-splicing reaction was monitored at different temperatures for the formation of the splice product (SP) ST-gpD-Trx-H6 and the consumption of the IntN and IntC precursors in SDS-PAGE gels. Also, the formation of the excised IntN and IntC fragments could be observed (compare Fig. 1B). The identity of the expected SP sequence was confirmed in each case by immunoblotting with anti-Strep-tag II and anti-Trx (data not shown). Moreover, the SP and also the trypsin fragment covering the new peptide bond linking the exteins were identified by LC-MS/MS (data not shown). To determine the kinetics of the reactions, aliquots were removed at the specified time points and immediately quenched by mixing with SDS sample buffer and boiling. Surprisingly, the four new split inteins showed extremely fast trans-splicing reactions. In particular, the gp41-1 intein exhibited outstanding splice kinetics and yields with optimal performance at 45 °C. As shown in Fig. 2A, already within the first seconds of the reaction, the two precursor proteins disappeared almost completely (bands 1 and 6), whereas the SP and the IntN and IntC halves were formed. The other inteins gp41-8, NrdJ-1, and IMPDH-1 also spliced exceptionally fast and efficiently. After 1 min of incubation at their optimal temperature (37 °C), the respective precursors (Fig. 2B, bands 2 and 7, 3 and 8, and 4 and 9) were nearly depleted, and the SP as well as the IntN and IntC halves were detected as the predominant bands in the SDS-PAGE gels. For comparison, the previously described Npu DnaE intein was examined at its optimal temperature of 37 °C (26.Zettler J. Schütz V. Mootz H.D. The naturally split Npu DnaE intein exhibits an extraordinarily high rate in the protein trans-splicing reaction.FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 909-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Fig. 2C shows that SP formation occurred at a lower rate than seen for the new split inteins. For instance, after 1 min, the precursors are converted to the products to only about 50%. For a more quantitative analysis, rates (k) and yields (in percentage) from the time course experiments were determined under different temperatures (Fig. 3). Rates were fitted to an exponential first-order equation with the assumption that intein fragment association is fast when compared with protein trans-splicing (29.Shi J. Muir T.W. Development of a tandem protein trans-splicing system based on native and engineered split inteins.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 6198-6206Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). All results of this comprehensive analysis are listed in Table 2. For the Npu DnaE intein, the rate of splice product formation k = (1.4 ± 0.3) × 10−2 s−1 corresponded to a t½ = 50 s at its optimal temperature of 37 °C (Fig. 3A), whereas 80–90% yield was observed under these conditions. These findings are in good agreement with the previous study (26.Zettler J. Schütz V. Mootz H.D. The naturally split Npu DnaE intein exhibits an extraordinarily high rate in the protein trans-splicing reaction.FEBS Lett. 2009; 583: 909-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Fig. 3A shows that the gp41-1 intein was active over a wide range of temperatures and exhibited its highest rate and yield at 45 °C, with an unprecedented k = (1.8 ± 0.5) × 10−1 s−1, corresponding to a t½ = 3.8 s. Yields of 85–95% were reached with no apparent formation of side products by N- or C-terminal cleavage (see also Fig. 2A). Fig. 3B depicts detailed time courses of gp41-1 SP formation at different temperatures. This intein is thus ∼13-fold times faster than the Npu DnaE intein at its optimal temperature and ∼10-fold faster at 37 °C.TABLE 2Apparent first order rate constants and yields of trans-splicing reactions - temperature dependencegp41-1(1 + 6)gp41-8(2 + 7)NrdJ-1(3"
https://openalex.org/W1986541440,"Polyphosphate (polyP) is a pro-inflammatory agent and a potent modulator of the human blood-clotting system. The presence of polyP of 60 phosphate units was identified in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL-2H3) mast cells using specific enzymatic assays, urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of cell extracts, and staining of cells with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and the polyP-binding domain of Escherichia coli exopolyphosphatase. PolyP co-localizes with serotonin- but not with histamine-containing granules. PolyP levels greatly decreased in mast cells stimulated to degranulate by IgE. Mast cell granules were isolated and found to be acidic and decrease their polyP content upon alkalinization. In agreement with these results, when RBL-2H3 mast cells were loaded with the fluorescent calcium indicator fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester to measure their intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)), they were shown to possess a significant amount of Ca(2+) stored in an acidic compartment different from lysosomes. PolyP derived from RBL-2H3 mast cells stimulated bradykinin formation, and it was also detected in human basophils. All of these characteristics of mast cell granules, together with their known elemental composition, and high density, are similar to those of acidocalcisomes. The results suggest that mast cells polyP could be an important mediator of their pro-inflammatory and pro-coagulant activities."
https://openalex.org/W2007430436,"Covalent modification of histones by protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) impacts genome organization and gene expression. In this report, we show that PRMT7 interacts with the BRG1-based hSWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex and specifically methylates histone H2A Arg-3 (H2AR3) and histone H4 Arg-3 (H4R3). To elucidate the biological function of PRMT7, we knocked down its expression in NIH 3T3 cells and analyzed global gene expression. Our findings show that PRMT7 negatively regulates expression of genes involved in DNA repair, including ALKBH5, APEX2, POLD1, and POLD2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed that PRMT7 and dimethylated H2AR3 and H4R3 are enriched at target DNA repair genes in parental cells, whereas PRMT7 knockdown caused a significant decrease in PRMT7 recruitment and H2AR3/H4R3 methylation. Decreased PRMT7 expression also resulted in derepression of target DNA repair genes and enhanced cell resistance to DNA-damaging agents. Furthermore, we show that BRG1 co-localizes with PRMT7 on target promoters and that expression of a catalytically inactive form of BRG1 results in derepression of PRMT7 target DNA repair genes. Remarkably, reducing expression of individual PRMT7 target DNA repair genes showed that only the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase, POLD1, was able to resensitize PRMT7 knock-down cells to DNA-damaging agents. These results provide evidence for the important role played by PRMT7 in epigenetic regulation of DNA repair genes and cellular response to DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2095004167,"In eukaryotic cells, there are two well characterized pathways that regulate translation initiation in response to stress, and each have been shown to be targeted by various viruses. We recently showed in a yeast-based model that the bacterial virulence factor YopJ disrupts one of these pathways, which is centered on the α-subunit of the translation factor eIF2. Here, we show in mammalian cells that induction of the eIF2 signaling pathway occurs following infection with bacterial pathogens and that, consistent with our yeast-based findings, YopJ reduces eIF2 signaling in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress, heavy metal toxicity, dsRNA, and bacterial infection. We demonstrate that the well documented activities of YopJ, inhibition of NF-κB activation and proinflammatory cytokine expression, are both dependent on an intact eIF2 signaling pathway. Unexpectedly, we found that cells with defective eIF2 signaling were more susceptible to bacterial invasion. This was true for pathogenic Yersinia, a facultative intracellular pathogen, as well as for the intracellular pathogens Listeria monocytogenes and Chlamydia trachomatis. Collectively, our data indicate that the highly conserved eIF2 signaling pathway, which is vitally important for antiviral responses, plays a variety of heretofore unrecognized roles in antibacterial responses."

Recently, the aberrant expressions of miRNAs have become a major focus in cancer research. The purpose of this study was to identify deregulated miRNAs in oral cancer and further focus on specific miRNAs that were related to patient survival. Here, we report that miRNA expression profiling provided more precise information when oral squamous cell carcinomas were subcategorized on the basis of clinicopathological parameters (tumor primary site, histological subtype, tumor stage, and HPV16 status). An innovative radar chart analysis method was developed to depict subcategories of cancers taking into consideration the expression patterns of multiple miRNAs combined with the clinicopathological parameters. Keratinization of tumors and the high expression of miR-21 were the major factors related to the poor prognosis of patients. Interestingly, a majority of the keratinized tumors expressed high levels of miR-21. Further investigations demonstrated the regulation of the tumor suppressor gene reversion-inducing cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifs (RECK) by two keratinization-associated miRNAs, miR-7 and miR-21. Transfection of miR-7 and miR-21-mimics reduced the expression of RECK through direct miRNA-mediated regulation, and these miRNAs were inversely correlated with RECK in CAL 27 orthotopic xenograft tumors. Furthermore, a similar inverse correlation was demonstrated in CAL 27 cells treated in vitro by different external stimuli such as trypsinization, cell density, and serum concentration.

Oral cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide, with squamous cell carcinomas being the most common type, accounting for ∼90% of all oral cancers (1Scully C. Felix D.H. Oral medicine. Update for the dental practitioner oral cancer.Br. Dent. J. 2006; 200: 13-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Approximately 300,000 new cases of oral cancers (amounting to 3% of total cancers) are anticipated annually (2Jemal A. Tiwari R.C. Murray T. Ghafoor A. Samuels A. Ward E. Feuer E.J. Thun M.J. Cancer statistics, 2004.CA. Cancer J. Clin. 2004; 54: 8-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (3902) Google Scholar). Although many studies have demonstrated how clinical and histological staging may explain why some cancers, but not others, behave aggressively, these stagings do not always properly reflect the extent of disease (3Lin W.H.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non-coding RNAs, ∼18–25 nucleotides in length, that act as posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression in diverse cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, development, and cell death (7Bartel D.P. MicroRNAs. Target recognition and regulatory functions.Cell. 2009; 136: 215-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15850) Google Scholar). Over 60% of all mammalian mRNAs are predicted targets of miRNAs, indicating their extensive roles in the regulation of numerous cellular processes (8Friedman R.C. Farh K.K. Burge C.B. Bartel D.P. Most mammalian mRNAs are conserved targets of microRNAs.Genome Res. 2009; 19: 92-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (6359) Google Scholar). The discovery of miRNAs and the elucidation of their function in regulating gene expression levels demonstrates their increasing importance in cancer genetics (9Garzon R. Marcucci G. Croce C.M. Targeting microRNAs in cancer. Rationale, strategies and challenges.Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2010; 9: 775-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (1293) Google Scholar). In cancer, some miRNAs have been found to play roles as regulators for tumor suppressors or oncogenes, depending on the tumor microenvironment and/or tissue type. When epithelial cells keratinize, keratins and keratin filament-associated proteins are synthesized and assembled to form keratin filaments (10Bragulla H.H. Homberger D.G.

During these processes, signaling molecules such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) modulate the process of keratinization (10Bragulla H.H. Homberger D.G.

In particular, MMP-9 has been implicated in the process of keratinization (11Kobayashi T. Kishimoto J. Ge Y. Jin W. Hudson D.L. Ouahes N. Ehama R. Shinkai H. Burgeson R.E. A novel mechanism of matrix metalloproteinase-9 gene expression implies a role for keratinization.EMBO Rep. 2001; 2: 604-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). MMPs are well known to play crucial roles for tumor progression by degrading the extracellular matrix barriers encompassing the tumor and permitting invasion into surrounding connective tissues (12Coussens L.M.

Therefore, studies of the relation between RECK and keratinization may yield important insights into the mechanisms of carcinogenesis and the prognosis of oral cancer patients. Although the majority of oral cancers are OSCCs, the heterogeneity within OSCCs and the limited molecular data regarding carcinogenesis hamper our understanding of the biological differences in OSCC subclasses. Therefore, the aim of this study was to identify prognostic indicators for oral cancer and to understand how aberrantly expressed miRNAs and their targets are involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. All human OSCCs and normal tongue tissues were collected from the Tissue Bank at the Moffitt Cancer Center (Protocol no. MCC-15370) and approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of South Florida (no. 106444). Written consent was given by the patients for their information to be stored in the Moffitt Tissue Bank and used for research. Clinicopathological characteristics of these 17 patients are shown in supplemental Table S1. Tissues were snap-frozen and stored at −80 °C until further use. Seven head and neck cancer cells (CAL 27, SCC-25, HN, BHY, FaDu, RPMI 2650, and OQ01), four cervical cancer cells (HeLa, SiHa, Ca Ski, and End1/E6E7), and HEK293 cells were used in this study. CAL 27, SCC-25, FaDu, RPMI 2650, HeLa, SiHa, Ca Ski, End1/E6E7, and HEK293 cells were purchased from the ATCC. HN and BHY cells were purchased from Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen, GmbH (DSMZ) (Braunschweig, Germany). OQ01 was a primary cultured head and neck cancer cell line provided by Dr. Lung-Ji Chang, University of Florida. CAL 27 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate; SCC-25 in DMEM/F12 supplemented with 15 mm HEPES, 1.2 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 0.5 mm sodium pyruvate, 400 ng/ml hydrocortisone; FaDu and RPMI 2650 in minimum essential medium supplemented with 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 1.0 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids; HN, BHY, and OQ01 in DMEM/F12; HeLa, SiHa, and HEK293 in DMEM; Ca Ski in RPMI1640 medium; End1/E6E7 in Keratinocyte medium (ScienCell, San Diego, CA). All the media except Keratinocyte medium were supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. Keratinocyte medium was prepared according to the protocol of the manufacturer. All cell lines were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 37 °C with 5% CO2. All transfections were performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the protocol of the manufacturer. miRNA mimics and nonspecific negative control molecules were purchased from Ambion (Austin, TX). Transfected cells were incubated in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 for 72 h. All the RNA used in this study was isolated using the mirVanaTM miRNA isolation kit (Ambion). Human tissues measuring ∼60 mm3 in volume were homogenized using the PowerGen 125 (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA) in 600 μl of the lysis/binding buffer, after which total RNA was isolated according to the instructions of the manufacturer. A NanoDrop ND-100 spectrophotometer (Nanodrop Technology, Inc., Wilmington, DE) was used to quantify the isolated RNA. Additionally, an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer from the Interdisciplinary Center for Biotechnology Research at the University of Florida was used to monitor the size distribution and overall quality of total RNA prior to miRNA profiling. Total RNAs isolated from three normal tongues and 17 OSCCs were processed by Asuragen Services (Austin, TX) according to standard operating procedures.

Reverse transcription was performed using the TaqMan MicroRNA reverse transcription kit or TaqMan high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit for miRNA and mRNA, respectively (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Quantification of miRNA and mRNA expression was performed using TaqMan MicroRNA assays, TaqMan gene expression assays, and TaqMan Fast Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The experiments were processed and analyzed using the Applied Biosystems StepOne real-time PCR machine. Fold change values were calculated using the 2−ΔΔCt method. In addition to the three normal tissues used for the microarray analyses, two normal tongue tissues were added in the qRT-PCR analyses to enhance statistical computation. U6 snRNA and 18S rRNA were used as internal controls to normalize all the miRNA or mRNA expressions. TaqMan primer sets were used to measure mRNA levels of HPV16-E6 and HPV16-E7 using real-time PCR (22Cattani P. Siddu A. D'Onghia S. Marchetti S. Santangelo R. Vellone V.G. Zannoni G.F. Fadda G.

The degree of HPV status was determined by the corresponding cycle threshold (Ct) values: -, undetectable; +, Ct > 32; ++, 25 < Ct < 32; +++, Ct < 25. OSCCs were separated into subgroups according to their clinicopathological characteristics (supplemental Table S1). The tumors were separated on the basis of the primary site (oropharynx or oral cavity), histological subtype (non-keratinized or keratinized), tumor stage (early stage or advanced stage), and HPV16 status (negative or positive). The TNM (tumor size (T), regional nodal involvement (N), presence or absence of distant metastasis (M)) classification system was used to determine tumor stage. Pathological TNM staging was primarily used, but clinical TNM staging was used for three tumor samples (T1715B, T1231D, and T470A), for which pathological TNM was unspecified. Radar charts generated by Microsoft Excel 2010 software were used to visualize the expression profiles of 10 miRNAs in 17 OSCCs. The relative expression values in OSCCs compared with those of normal controls obtained by qRT-PCR were adjusted so that the 10 miRNAs analyzed were represented on a similar scale. All values were converted into log units, and then overexpressed miRNAs were divided by the highest value obtained for the corresponding individual miRNA. For miR-486-5p, which was an underexpressed miRNA, the values were divided by the lowest expressed value among the samples to generate an opposite effect for convenient visualization. NET/0.3%Nonidet P-40 buffer (150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.3% Nonidet P-40) with Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor (Roche) was used to prepare cell lysates. Proteins quantitated using BCA (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) were separated on 7.5% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The dilutions of primary antibodies were: 1:250 for mouse anti-RECK (BD Biosciences) and 1:5000 for mouse anti-tubulin antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO). Secondary goat anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were used at 1:10000 dilutions (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). Immunoreactive bands were detected by the SuperSignal chemiluminescent system (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL). Densitometric analyses for the developed films were performed using Image J software (National Institutes of Health). RECK protein expression levels were normalized to tubulin, and the percentage changes were calculated compared to the mock control. Diluted cell lysates of the untreated samples (25, 50, and 100%) were used to document the semiquantitative measurement of the Western blot analysis results. The 3′ UTR of RECK was PCR-amplified and cloned between EcoRI and NotI of the pMiR-Target vector (OriGene Technologies, Rockville, MD). Mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and the mutated sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. All the primers used for generating luciferase constructs are listed in supplemental Table S2. HEK293 cells transfected with luciferase reporters and miRNA mimics were harvested after 48 h. The luciferase activities were measured using a dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega, Madison, WI) and FLUOstar OPTIMA (BMG Labtech, Germany). Renilla luciferase (pRL-CMV, Promega) expression levels were used as an internal control to normalize the relative expressions of firefly luciferase (24Lian S.L. Li S. Abadal G.X.

CAL 27 cells were washed with PBS and treated with trypsin solution (0.25% trypsin/2.21 mm EDTA in Hank's buffered salt solution (CellGro, Manassas, VA)) in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. Detached cells were collected in a 15-ml conical tube 5 min after treatment, and 3 ml of fresh trypsin solution was added back to the flask. The same procedure was performed to collect the detached cells after 10- and 15-min treatments. Cells collected after 5, 10, and 15 min were washed with PBS and subjected to the RNA isolation process and further experiments. Tumor samples from xenografts were obtained in a previous study (26Jakymiw A. Patel R.S. Deming N. Bhattacharyya I. Shah P. Lamont R.J. Stewart C.M. Cohen D.M. Chan E.K. Overexpression of dicer as a result of reduced let-7 MicroRNA levels contributes to increased cell proliferation of oral cancer cells.Genes Chromosomes Cancer. 2010; 49: 549-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In brief, CAL 27 cells at 500,000 cells/50 μl were injected submucosally in the floor of the mouth of anesthetized eight-week-old NOD-SCID mice. Oral tumors were grown for 2 weeks, after which the animals were sacrificed. The tumor tissues were then harvested, and RNA was extracted as described above for human tumors. For the microarray analysis, one-way analysis of variance was performed across all samples for statistical hypothesis testing, and two-tailed Student's t tests were performed for all pairwise comparisons. Significance was assigned to probes demonstrating a false discovery rate of corrected p values < 0.05, as described by Benjamini et al. (27Benjamini Y. Hochberg Y. Controlling the false discovery rate: a practical and powerful approach to multiple testing.J. R. Stat. Soc. 1995; 57: 289-300Google Scholar). All experiments were repeated at least three times, and the statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 4.0 (Graph Pad Software, La Jolla, CA). Microarray expression profiling of 17 OSCCs compared with three normal tongue tissues identified significant (p < 0.05) differences in the expression levels of 134 miRNAs. In particular, a heat map using supervised hierarchical clustering analyses with criteria of p < 0.05 and a Log2 difference over 1.5 demonstrated that OSCCs had seven underexpressed and 62 overexpressed miRNAs when compared with normal tissues (Fig. 1A). Moreover, the tumors formed a hierarchical clustering of groups (a distinct cluster indicates the differential expression between normal (N1-N3, gray) and OSCC samples (other colors)) depending on their clinicopathological parameters (Fig. 1A and supplemental Table S1). For example, six of seven oropharynx samples (brown) were clustered into a group in which five of the six were recorded as tumors originating at the base of the tongue. All of these tumors (T1284C, T3019C, T1715B, T661B, and T1231D) were non-keratinizing tumors (light purple). In addition, 10 HPV16-positive tumors formed two clusters: four (T3982D, T1373B, T4182B, and T577E) keratinizing and six (T426D, T1284C, T3019C, T1715B, T661B, and T1231D) non-keratinizing tumors all derived from oropharynx regions (Fig. 1A). Of the 69 aberrantly expressed miRNAs identified in the microarray analysis, nine up-regulated miRNAs (miR-9*, miR-424, miR-7–1*, miR-15b, miR-7, miR-21, miR-9, miR-155, and miR-196a) and one down-regulated miRNA (miR-486-5p) were selected for further verification by Taqman qRT-PCR. Selection of miRNAs was performed on the basis of the fold changes and the p values from our microarray data, although some miRNAs were chosen because of their potential involvement in oncogenesis (e.g. miR-196a (28Chen C. Zhang Y. Zhang L. Weakley S.M. Yao Q. MicroRNA-196. Critical roles and clinical applications in development and cancer.J. Cell Mol.

Because the tumors formed distinct clusters on the basis of our microarray data (Fig. 1A), the results obtained from the qRT-PCR experiments were further analyzed for the differences among the subtypes of OSCCs instead of considering all 17 tumors as a single homogenous group. Interestingly, significantly different miRNA expression levels were observed when subtypes of OSCCs were taken into consideration, as shown in Fig. 1, B–E. These observations indicated that the heterogeneous expression of miRNAs in OSCCs depends on their individual characteristics. Radar chart analyses were used to visualize the expression patterns of the 10 miRNAs selected for verification in individual OSCCs. When all 17 tumors were analyzed together, a complex heterogeneity was observed (supplemental Fig. S1A). In contrast, normal tissues exhibited similar contours, with the exception of one sample (supplemental Fig. S1B, N2). Interestingly, when using different combinations of these clinicopathological parameters, unique miRNA expression patterns were generated for specific subtypes of OSCCs (Fig. 2). Each subtype of tumor formed a contour that was easily distinguishable from that of the overall tumor population (Fig. 2 and supplemental Fig. S1A). Thus, these data demonstrated that combinatorial interpretations of clinicopathological features and miRNA expression profiles could be used as specific signatures of individual subtypes of oral tumors. The overall 5-year survival rate for the patients in this study was 41.2% (7 of 17, Supplemental Table S1). Clinicopathological parameters and miRNA expression patterns of OSCCs were examined to evaluate their correlation to the survival rate of the patients. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses demonstrated that patients with advanced stage tumors (5-year survival, 27.3% (3/11); hazard ratio, 3.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.08–10.49; p = 0.037) and/or keratinizing tumors (5-year survival, 11.1% (1/9); hazard ratio, 3.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.10–10.12; p = 0.033) were significantly associated with a poor survival prognosis (Fig. 3, A and B). From our clinical data, we found that 89% of patients (eight of nine) with keratinized tumors survived less than 3 years (36"
https://openalex.org/W1964482047,"Yca1, the only metacaspase in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is thought to be a clan CD cysteine protease that includes the caspase subfamily. Although yeast is a single cell eukaryote, it can undergo a cell death process reminiscent of apoptosis. Yca1 has been reported to play an important role in the regulation of such apoptotic process. However, the structure and functional mechanism of Yca1 remain largely enigmatic. In this study, we report the crystal structure of the Yca1 metacaspase at 1.7 Å resolution, confirming a caspase-like fold. In sharp contrast to canonical caspases, however, Yca1 exists as a monomer both in solution and in the crystals. Canonical caspase contains six β-strands, with strand β6 pairing up with β6 of another caspase molecule to form a homodimerization interface. In Yca1, an extra pair of antiparallel β-strands forms a continuous β-sheet with the six caspase-common β-strands, blocking potential dimerization. Yca1 was reported to undergo autocatalytic processing in yeast; overexpression in bacteria also led to autoprocessing of Yca1 into two fragments. Unexpectedly, we found that both the autocatalytic processing and the proteolytic activity of Yca1 are greatly facilitated by the presence of calcium (Ca(2+)), but not other divalent cations. Our structural and biochemical characterization identifies Yca1 as a Ca(2+)-activated cysteine protease that may cleave specific substrates during stress response in yeast."

However, how anti-inflammatory cytokines mediate their suppressive activities is not well understood. In this study, we show that STAT3 contributes to mechanisms that control the duration of T cell proliferation by regulating the subcellular location of FoxO1 and FoxO3a, two Class O Forkhead transcription factors that mediate lymphocyte quiescence and inhibit T cell activation. We show that active FoxO1 and FoxO3a reside exclusively in the nucleus of naïve T cells whereas inactive pFoxO1 and pFoxO3a were most abundant in activated T cells and sequestered in their cytoplasm in association with unphosphorylated STAT3 (U-STAT3) and 14-3-3. We further show that FoxO1/FoxO3a rapidly relocalized into the nucleus in response to pSTAT3 activation by IL-6 or IL-10, and the accumulation of FoxO1/FoxO3a in their nuclei coincided with increased expression of p27Kip1 and p21WAF1. STAT3 inhibitors completely abrogated cytokine-induced translocation of FoxO1/FoxO3a into the nucleus. In naïve or resting STAT3-deficient T cells, expression of pFoxO1/pFoxO3a was predominantly in the cytoplasm and correlated with defects in p27Kip1 and p21WAF1 expression, suggesting requirement of STAT3 for importation or retention of FoxO in the nucleus and attenuation of lymphocyte proliferation. Taken together, these results suggest that U-STAT3 collaborates with 14-3-3 to sequester pFoxO1/pFoxO3a in cytoplasm and thus prolong T cell activation, whereas pSTAT3 activation by anti-inflammatory cytokines would curtail the duration of TCR activation and re-establish lymphocyte quiescence by inducing nuclear localization of FoxO1/FoxO3a and FoxO-mediated expression of growth-inhibitory proteins.

However, upon TCR engagement, PI3K/AKT phosphorylates and inactivates FoxO, induces their expulsion from the nucleus by the 14-3-3 scaffolding protein, and thereby overrides the block on T cell activation imposed by FoxO proteins (2Coffer P.J.

Binding of 14-3-3 to the FoxO proteins not only promotes nuclear export of the pFoxO·14-3-3 complex, it inhibits the nuclear import of FoxO by interfering with the function of its nuclear localization signal (NLS) (6Silhan J.

However, unbridled activation of T cells must be avoided. Thus, effector T cells have been shown to limit T cell proliferative responses by producing the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (9O'Garra A. Vieira P. TH1 cells control themselves by producing interleukin-10.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). However, the exact mechanisms that terminate T cell activation and mediate suppressive activities of IL-10 are not well understood. Class O Forkhead transcription factor nuclear localization signal tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 T cell receptor unphosphorylated STAT3. STAT3 is an abundant latent cytoplasmic transcription factor. Similar to FoxO proteins, biological activity of STAT3 is regulated by post-transcriptional mechanisms that regulate their subcellular localization (10Darnell Jr., J.E. STATs and gene regulation.Science. 1997; 277: 1630-1635Crossref PubMed Scopus (3375) Google Scholar). Prior to activation, unphosphorylated STAT3 (U-STAT3) exists in the cytoplasm as stable antiparallel dimers, which are structurally distinct from the activated tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) dimer (11Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref Scopus (2492) Google Scholar, 12Mertens C. Darnell Jr., J.E. SnapShot: JAK-STAT signaling.Cell. 2007; 131: 612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). After activation, the pSTAT3 dimer assumes a parallel conformation, unmasks its NLS, allowing it to enter the nucleus via importin-α3-dependent transport to activate gene transcription (12Mertens C. Darnell Jr., J.E. SnapShot: JAK-STAT signaling.Cell. 2007; 131: 612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although the U-STAT3 protein also enters the nucleus, it is rapidly transported back to the cytoplasm by the nuclear export factor, Crm1 (13Meyer T. Vinkemeier U. Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of STAT transcription factors.Eur. J. Biochem. 2004; 271: 4606-4612Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although transcription-dependent functions of pSTAT3 are well documented (14Yang J. Liao X. Agarwal M.K. Barnes L. Auron P.E. Stark G.R. Unphosphorylated STAT3 accumulates in response to IL-6 and activates transcription by binding to NFκB.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1396-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar), it is only recently that transcription-independent function of U-STAT3 in the cytoplasm was discovered (15Gao S.P. Bromberg J.F. Touched and moved by STAT3.Sci. STKE. 2006; 2006: pe30Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Ng D.C. Lin B.H. Lim C.P. Huang G. Zhang T. Poli V. Cao X. STAT3 regulates microtubules by antagonizing the depolymerization activity of stathmin.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). A high level of U-STAT3 in IL-6-stimulated T cells was found to compete with IκB for p65/p50 to form a U-STAT3·U-NF-κB complex, and this finding has led to significant interest in identifying other transcription factors that might also interact with U-STAT3 in the cytoplasm. We recently showed that STAT3 inhibits T cell proliferation by enhancing expression of FoxO1 and FoxO3a, leading to increased expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins (17Oh H.M. Yu C.R. Golestaneh N. Amadi-Obi A. Lee Y.S. Eseonu A. Mahdi R.M. Egwuagu C.E. STAT3 protein promotes T cell survival and inhibits interleukin-2 production through up-regulation of Class O Forkhead transcription factors.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 30888-30897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We also showed that it limits the expansion of activated T cells by constraining their ability to produce IL-2 through FoxO1- and FoxO3a-dependent increases in IκB and IκB-mediated sequestration of NF-κB in the cytoplasm (17Oh H.M. Yu C.R. Golestaneh N. Amadi-Obi A. Lee Y.S. Eseonu A. Mahdi R.M. Egwuagu C.E.

Chem. 2011; 286: 30888-30897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, we did not examine whether STAT3 also regulated activities of FoxO protein through direct protein-protein interactions. In view of the discovery of transcription-independent functions of U-STAT3 in the cytoplasm (15Gao S.P. Bromberg J.F. Touched and moved by STAT3.Sci. STKE. 2006; 2006: pe30Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 16Ng D.C. Lin B.H. Lim C.P. Huang G. Zhang T. Poli V. Cao X. STAT3 regulates microtubules by antagonizing the depolymerization activity of stathmin.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 172: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), it was of interest to determine whether U-STAT3 interacts with pFoxO proteins in the cytoplasm. In this report, we describe a novel mechanism by which U-STAT3 contributes to mechanisms that sequester pFoxO1 and pFoxO3a in the cytoplasm and thus prolonged duration of TCR activation. However, we found that exposure of activated T cells to cytokines that activate pSTAT3 induced translocation of FoxO1 and FoxO3a into the nucleus and led to enhanced expression of growth-inhibitory proteins. Data presented in this report thus suggest a mechanism by which anti-inflammatory cytokines terminate T cell activation and re-establish lymphocyte quiescence. C57BL/6 mice (6–8 weeks old) were from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice with conditional deletion of STAT3 in the CD4+ T cell compartment (STAT3KO) have been described previously (18Liu X.

Animal care and use were in compliance with National Institutes of Health guidelines. CD4+ T cells isolated from spleen or lymph nodes (>98%) were activated in plate-bound anti-CD3 Abs (10 μg/ml) and soluble anti-CD28 Abs (3 μg/ml) without exogenous cytokines or Abs (Th0 condition) as described (18Liu X.

In some experiments the cells were activated in plate-bound anti-CD3 Abs (10 μg/ml) and soluble anti-CD28 Abs (3 μg/ml) under Th1, Th2, or Th17 polarization condition: Th1 condition, anti-CD3/CD28 + anti-IL-4 Abs (10 μg/ml) and IL-12 (10 ng/ml); Th17 condition, anti-CD3/CD28 + IL-6 (10 ng/ml) + TGF-β1 (2 ng/ml) + anti-IFN-γ Abs (10 μg/ml) + anti-IL-4 Abs (10 μg/ml); Th2 condition, anti-CD3/CD28 + anti-IFN-γ Abs (10 μg/ml) and IL-4 (10 ng/ml). For intracellular cytokine detection, cells were restimulated for 5 h with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (20 ng/ml)/ionomycin (1 μm). Golgi-stop was added in the last hour, and intracellular cytokine staining was performed using BD Biosciences Cytofix/Cytoperm kit as recommended (BD Pharmingen). FACS analysis was performed on a Becton-Dickinson FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) using monoclonal antibodies specific to CD4, CD62L, CD44, CD45RB, IL-17, and IFN-γ mAbs and corresponding isotype control Abs (BD Pharmingen) as described previously (19Amadi-Obi A.

WT or STAT3KO mouse T cells were activated for 4 days with anti-CD3/CD28 Abs under Th1 or Th2 polarization condition, and multiplex ELISA of supernatants for IL-2 secretion was performed using a commercial ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) as described (19Amadi-Obi A.

Med. 2007; 13: 711-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Preparation of whole cell lysates and immunodetection were performed as described (20Egwuagu C.E. Yu C.R. Zhang M. Mahdi R.M.

Briefly, samples (20–40 μg/lane) were fractionated on 4–20% gradient SDS-PAGE, and antibodies used were: STAT3, pSTAT3, pFoxO1, pFoxO3a (Cell Signaling Technology); p27Kip1, GAPDH, Oct1, β-actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). For some experiments nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared using NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents from Pierce, and the quality of the preparations was always verified by analysis of proteins differentially enriched in the nucleus (Oct1) or the cytoplasm (GAPDH). For immunoprecipitation analysis, 0.2 mg of whole cell extract was incubated with Dynabeads protein G and anti-FoxO3a or anti-pFoxO1(Thr-24)/FoxO3a (Thr-32) Abs as recommended (Dynal/Invitrogen). Preimmune serum was used in parallel as controls, and signals were detected with HRP-conjugated secondary F(ab′)2 Ab (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) using the ECL-PLUS system (Amersham Biosciences). CD4+ T cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing WT FoxO1-GFP fusion proteins (Addgene, Cambridge, MA) (5Stahl M. Dijkers P.F. Kops G.J. Lens S.M. Coffer P.J. Burgering B.M.

Purified CD4+ T cells from C57BL6 mice were grown on chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) and stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 Abs for varying amounts of time in the presence or absence of exogenous cytokines. Cells were fixed, blocked with 5% goat serum, and then incubated with primary antibodies (FoxO1, FoxO3a, pFoxO3a, STAT3, pSTAT3) from Santa Cruz Biotechnology or Cell Signaling. Slides were washed, incubated in Alexa Fluor 488- or Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated secondary Abs (Invitrogen) containing DAPI and examined on laser scanning confocal microscope as described (17Oh H.M. Yu C.R. Golestaneh N. Amadi-Obi A. Lee Y.S. Eseonu A. Mahdi R.M. Egwuagu C.E.

Chem. 2011; 286: 30888-30897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In a previous study, we showed that STAT3 induced the transcription of FoxO1 and FoxO3a genes and that the resulting increase in expression of FoxO1 and FoxO3a enhanced their transcriptional activities in T cells (17Oh H.M. Yu C.R. Golestaneh N. Amadi-Obi A. Lee Y.S. Eseonu A. Mahdi R.M. Egwuagu C.E.

Chem. 2011; 286: 30888-30897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In this study, we have investigated whether STAT3 interacts with FoxO proteins and whether such protein-protein interactions can enhance activities of FoxO proteins in T cells. We stimulated mouse naïve CD4+ T cells with anti-CD3/CD28 for 4 days and analyzed the effects of TCR activation on the spatial localization of FoxO1, FoxO3a, U-STAT3, and pSTAT3 proteins by confocal microscopy. In naïve CD4+ T cells most FoxO1 and FoxO3a were detected in the nucleus (Fig. 1A) but the FoxO proteins relocalized to the cytoplasm after 96-h stimulation (Fig. 1B), consistent with TCR-mediated expulsion of pFoxO from the nucleus of the activated T cells (3Brunet A. Bonni A. Zigmond M.J. Lin M.Z. Juo P. Hu L.S. Anderson M.J. Arden K.C. Blenis J. Greenberg M.E. Akt promotes cell survival by phosphorylating and inhibiting a Forkhead transcription factor.Cell. 1999; 96: 857-868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5412) Google Scholar). Most of the STAT3 in 96-h activated T cells were in the cytoplasm; and as indicated by the co-localization plots and the yellow/brownish signals of the merged images, both pFoxO1 and pFoxO3a co-localize with U-STAT3 in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1B). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the co-localization plots might simply reflect fortuitous spatial co-localization of the proteins in the cytoplasm. To determine whether STAT3 interacts with pFoxO, we stimulated mouse naïve CD4+ T cells with anti-CD3/CD28 for 4 days, prepared cytoplasmic extracts, and performed immunoprecipitations using Abs specific to pFoxO1/pFoxO3a as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Western blot analysis of the immunoprecipitates using Abs specific to STAT3 or pSTAT3 demonstrated that pFoxO1/pFoxO3a and FoxO3a interacted with U-STAT3 and pSTAT3 (Fig. 1C) regardless of TCR activation. To further confirm our results showing that U-STAT3 interacts with FoxO, we stimulated human Jurkat T cells and performed immunoprecipitation using FoxO3a antibodies. Again, Western blot analysis using STAT3-specific Abs established the direct interaction between U-STAT3 and pFoxO3a (Fig. 1D), underscoring the potential importance of the interaction between U-STAT3 and pFoxO1/FoxO3a proteins in human and mouse T cells. In line with a report that 14-3-3ζ associates with STAT3 (22Zhang J. Chen F. Li W. Xiong Q. Yang M. Zheng P. Li C. Pei J. Ge F. 14-3-3ζ interacts with STAT3 and regulates its constitutive activation in multiple myeloma cells.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e29554Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we show that 14-3-3 interacts with the FoxO·STAT3 complex (Fig. 1, E and F). FoxO proteins contain several domains and critical residues that contribute to their nuclear localization or nuclear exclusion, including the NLS, DNA binding domain, and a leptomycin-B-sensitive nuclear export signal (21Zhao X. Gan L. Pan H. Kan D. Majeski M. Adam S.A. Unterman T.G. Multiple elements regulate nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of FoxO1: characterization of phosphorylation- and 14-3-3-dependent and -independent mechanisms.Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). To characterize regions of the FoxO1 protein that interact with STAT3, we transfected mouse primary T cells with cDNA constructs expressing fusion proteins consisting of full-length or truncated FoxO1 in-frame with GFP (Fig. 2A). Full-length FoxO1-(1–655)- and FoxO1-(1–400)-GFP contain a DNA binding domain and nuclear export signal, whereas FoxO1-(1–149)-GFP does not contain these amino acid sequences (Fig. 2B) (21Zhao X. Gan L. Pan H. Kan D. Majeski M. Adam S.A. Unterman T.G. Multiple elements regulate nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of FoxO1: characterization of phosphorylation- and 14-3-3-dependent and -independent mechanisms.Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). However, FoxO1-(1–149)-GFP contains the critical Thr-24 residue that is required for binding to 14-3-3 or Crm1 and nuclear exclusion of FoxO1 (21Zhao X. Gan L. Pan H. Kan D. Majeski M. Adam S.A. Unterman T.G. Multiple elements regulate nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of FoxO1: characterization of phosphorylation- and 14-3-3-dependent and -independent mechanisms.Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). As indicated on fluorescence-intensity plots, full-length FoxO1-(1–655)- and FoxO1-(1–400)-GFP localized to the cytoplasm and to a lesser extent in nucleus of activated T cells (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, FoxO1-(1–149)-GFP localizes exclusively to the cytoplasm of the activated T cells, consistent with a previous report (21Zhao X. Gan L. Pan H. Kan D. Majeski M. Adam S.A. Unterman T.G. Multiple elements regulate nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of FoxO1: characterization of phosphorylation- and 14-3-3-dependent and -independent mechanisms.Biochem. J. 2004; 378: 839-849Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, each of the FoxO1-GFPs co-localized with STAT3 in cytoplasm (yellow signals in merged image; Fig. 2A). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation analysis revealed direct interactions between STAT3 and each of the three FoxO-GFP recombinant proteins, with the strongest intensity observed with FoxO1-(1–149) (Fig. 2C, top panel). However, Western blot analysis detected higher amount of FoxO1-(1–49) in transfected T cells, suggesting that the strong interaction observed with STAT3 derived in part from higher transfection efficiency of FoxO1 (1–149) (Fig. 2C, bottom panel). The binding of STAT3 to residues close to the binding site of 14-3-3 suggests possible formation of a novel transcription factor complex comprising of pFoxO, U-STAT3, and 14-3-3 in the cytoplasm. Taken together with results of a recent study showing that STAT3 interacts with 14-3-3ζ (22Zhang J. Chen F. Li W. Xiong Q. Yang M. Zheng P. Li C. Pei J. Ge F. 14-3-3ζ interacts with STAT3 and regulates its constitutive activation in multiple myeloma cells.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e29554Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), these results suggest that STAT3 may stabilize interactions between 14-3-3 and pFoxO and thus contribute to mechanisms that sequester pFoxO1/pFoxO3a in the cytoplasm of activated T cells. Effector T cells limit tissue injury during infection by producing cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-27 that induce IL-10 (23Fitzgerald D.C. Zhang G.X. El-Behi M. Fonseca-Kelly Z. Li H. Yu S. Saris C.J. Gran B. Ciric B. Rostami A. Suppression of autoimmune inflammation of the central nervous system by interleukin 10 secreted by interleukin 27-stimulated T cells.Nat.

A dominant function for interleukin 27 in generating interleukin 10-producing anti-inflammatory T cells.Nat. Immunol. 2007; 8: 1380-1389Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). IL-10 in turn suppresses prolonged inflammatory responses by curtailing T cell proliferation through STAT3-dependent mechanisms (9O'Garra A. Vieira P. TH1 cells control themselves by producing interleukin-10.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2007; 7: 425-428Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 25Murray P.J. The primary mechanism of the IL-10-regulated antiinflammatory response is to selectively inhibit transcription.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 8686-8691Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 26Murray P.J. STAT3-mediated anti-inflammatory signalling.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 1028-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined whether tyrosine phosphorylation of U-STAT3 by IL-10 could destabilize the complex interactions between pFoxO, U-STAT3, and 14-3-3 in the cytoplasm and promote nuclear localization of FoxO. We therefore stimulated T cells with IL-10 after TCR activation with anti-CD3/CD28 and examined whether the activation of STAT3 by IL-10 would facilitate nuclear localization of FoxO. In the cells stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 for 48 h, we detected intense pFoxO-specific (intense green signals) and STAT3-specific (intense red signals) immunoreactivity in the cytoplasm, suggesting the co-localization (intense orange/yellow signals in merged image) of pFoxO1 and U-STAT3 in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3A). However, in the T cells stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 for 42 h and then exposed to IL-10 for an additional 6 h, we detected a substantial increase in the number of activated T cells expressing FoxO1 and pSTAT3 in the nucleus (Fig. 3A, middle panels). Interestingly, in T cells that were stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 for 36 h followed by exposure to IL-10 for an additional 12 h, the FoxO1 proteins relocalized to the cytoplasm and co-localized with U-STAT3 (Fig. 3A, bottom panels). The latter result suggests that the IL-10-mediated nuclear localization of FoxO1 is transient and temporally correlates with the relatively short duration of pSTAT3 signaling. To confirm these results biochemically, we prepared nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts from the T cells activated in the presence or absence of IL-10. In line with our immunocytochemical data, Western blot analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts detected increases in FoxO1 and FoxO3a proteins in the nucleus of IL-10-treated T cells but not in nuclei of the untreated T cells (Fig. 3B). Because FoxO proteins maintain lymphocytes in a quiescent state, in part, by up-regulating the expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins, we examined whether exposure of activated T cells to IL-10 would enhance their expression. We detected increase in the level of p27Kip1 (Fig. 3C), indicating a link between IL-10-induced increase of the nuclear localization of FoxO1 and FoxO3a and enhanced expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p27Kip1. Another cytokine that mediates its biological activities through activation of STAT3 is IL-6 (11Levy D.E. Darnell Jr., J.E. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2002; 3: 651-662Crossref Scopus (2492) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether IL-6 can also enhance nuclear localization of FoxO proteins. Likewise, exposure of activated T cells to IL-6 induced translocation of FoxO3a and pSTAT3 into the nucleus (Fig. 4A), suggesting that this may be a common attribute of cytokines that activate STAT3. To firmly establish the role of STAT3 in mediating FoxO translocation into the nucleus, we examined whether two distinct STAT3 inhibitors, ORLL-NIH001 and STAT3VIII, could abrogate IL-6-mediated nuclear translocation of FoxO3a. ORLL-NIH001 is a synthetic small molecule that inhibits STAT3 and STAT3-mediated diseases whereas STAT3VIII is a cell-permeable porphyrin compound that binds STAT3 and prevents STAT3 SH2 domain-mediated ligand binding and dimerization (27Yu C.R. Lee Y.S. Mahdi R.M. Surendran N. Egwuagu C.E. Therapeutic targeting of STAT3 (signal transducers and activators of transcription 3) pathway inhibits experimental autoimmune uveitis.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e29742Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Both inhibitors strongly inhibited IL-6-induced STAT3 nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity with no effect on other STAT proteins (27Yu C.R. Lee Y.S. Mahdi R.M. Surendran N. Egwuagu C.E. Therapeutic targeting of STAT3 (signal transducers and activators of transcription 3) pathway inhibits experimental autoimmune uveitis.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e29742Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). We stimulated naïve CD4+ T cells with anti-CD3/CD28 Abs in the presence or absence IL-6 and show here that the IL-6-induced nuclear localization of FoxO3a was abrogated by ORLL-NIH001 or STAT3VIII (Fig. 4B), providing further evidence for the involvement of STAT3 in cytokine-mediated nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of FoxO proteins. We next used STAT3-deficient T cells to examine directly the role of STAT3 in nuclear import of FoxO proteins in T cells. Analysis of subcellular locations of FoxO proteins revealed that both FoxO1 and FoxO3a predominantly localized to the nucleus of WT naïve T cells whereas the FoxO proteins were detected mainly in the cytoplasm of the STAT3KO naïve T cells (Fig. 5A). However, FoxO1 and FoxO3a levels were much reduced in STAT3KO T cells (Fig. 5A), consistent with previous report of STAT3-mediated induction of the expression of FoxO1 and FoxO3a (17Oh H.M. Yu C.R. Golestaneh N. Amadi-Obi A. Lee Y.S. Eseonu A. Mahdi R.M. Egwuagu C.E. STAT3 protein promotes T cell survival and inhibits interleukin-2 production through up-regulation of Class O Forkhead transcription factors.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 30888-30897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). We also detected a marked increase in the expression of cell surface markers of lymphocyte activation on STAT3KO cells (Fig. 5B), suggesting that STAT3-deficient naïve T cells are preactivated. Thus, the sequestration of pFoxO1 and pFoxO3a in the cytoplasm of naïve STAT3KO T cells derived in part from their preactivated state and may underscore the requirement of STAT3 for importation of FoxO proteins into the nucleus. It is however interesting that the overall reduction in FoxO proteins and their sequestration in the cytoplasm STAT3KO T cells correlate with the down-regulation of p27Kip1 and p21WAF1 (Fig. 5C). Analysis of T cells stimulated for 4 days further revealed an exaggerated increase in IL-2 production (Fig. 5D) and marked increase in expression of effector cytokines, IFN-γ and IL-17 (Fig. 5E) by STAT3KO T cells. Together, these results suggest that loss of STAT3-mediated up-regulation of FoxO1/FoxO3a led to a decrease in the cell cycle inhibitor, p27Kip1, and an inability to attenuate or terminate proliferative responses of STAT3KO T cells. In this study, we have provided data showing that STAT3 regulates nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of Class O Forkhead transcription factors and may therefore be involved in mechanisms that terminate or regulate the duration T cell activation. We show that active unphosphorylated FoxO proteins reside predominantly in the nucleus of naïve T cells (Figs. 1A and 5A) and that in response to TCR activation FoxO proteins become phosphorylated (pFoxO) and relocalize into the cytoplasm. It is notable that pFoxO1 and pFoxO3a remained sequestered in the cytoplasm through 4 days of T cell activation, suggesting that T lymphocytes can be maintained in the activated state, insofar as pFoxO proteins remain sequestered in the cytoplasm. The pFoxO1 and pFoxO3a proteins co-localized with the abundant latent cytoplasmic transcription factor, U-STAT3 (Fig. 1B), and we demonstrate that U-STAT3 interacts directly with pFoxO1 and pFoxO3a in the cytoplasm of activated T cells (Fig. 1, C and D). We have mapped the STAT3-FoxO1 interaction site to the N-terminal amino acids 1–149 of FoxO1 (Fig. 2C), a region of the FoxO1 protein that contains binding sites for the 14-3-3 scaffolding protein. Because STAT3 also interacts with 14-3-3 proteins (Fig. 1, E and F) (22Zhang J. Chen F. Li W. Xiong Q. Yang M. Zheng P. Li C. Pei J. Ge F. 14-3-3ζ interacts with STAT3 and regulates its constitutive activation in multiple myeloma cells.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e29554Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), it may well be that STAT3 plays a role in stabilizing interactions between 14-3-3 and inactive pFoxO proteins, thereby contributing to mechanisms that sequester pFoxO1 and pFoxO3a in the cytoplasm of activated T cells. However, an equally plausible explanation for existence of U-STAT3 in a complex with pFoxO and 14-3-3 in the cytoplasm may be to provide a rapid mechanism for attenuating T cell activation. Thus, U-STAT3 may serve as a target for tyrosine phosphorylation by cytokines leading to disruption of the protein-protein interactions that promote sequestration of pFoxO proteins in the cytoplasm. It is intriguing that cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-27 that suppress autoimmune inflammation inhibit T cell proliferation by inducing STAT3-mediated production of IL-10 (23Fitzgerald D.C. Zhang G.X. El-Behi M. Fonseca-Kelly Z. Li H. Yu S. Saris C.J. Gran B. Ciric B. Rostami A.

Immunol. 2007; 8: 1363-1371Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Although exact mechanisms that are responsible for the suppressive activities of IL-10 are still not clear, the primary mechanism is through STAT3-dependent transcriptional activation of growth-inhibitory genes (25Murray P.J. The primary mechanism of the IL-10-regulated antiinflammatory response is to selectively inhibit transcription.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2005; 102: 8686-8691Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar, 26Murray P.J. STAT3-mediated anti-inflammatory signalling.Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2006; 34: 1028-1031Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Consistent with the notion that activation of STAT3 might contribute to mechanisms that terminate TCR activation, data presented here reveal that exposure of activated T cells to IL-10 induced rapid relocalization of pFoxO1 and pFoxO3a from the cytoplasm into the nucleus (Fig. 3, A and B). Moreover, the resulting increase of FoxO1 and FoxO3a in the nucleus coincided with elevated levels of p27Kip1 (Fig. 3C). In this context, it is interesting that FoxO proteins were detected mainly in the cytoplasm of the STAT3KO naïve T cells (Fig. 5A), suggesting a potential role of STAT3 in nuclear import and/or retention of FoxO in nuclei of T cells. We have also shown that loss of STAT3 correlates with the down-regulation of FoxO1 and FoxO3a, decrease in the levels of cell cycle inhibitors, p27Kip1 and p21WAF1 and inability to attenuate or terminate T cell proliferative responses (17Oh H.M. Yu C.R. Golestaneh N. Amadi-Obi A. Lee Y.S. Eseonu A. Mahdi R.M. Egwuagu C.E.

Chem. 2011; 286: 30888-30897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). U-STAT3 exists in the cytoplasm as antiparallel dimers, and tyrosine phosphorylation induces them to assume a parallel conformation (12Mertens C. Darnell Jr., J.E. SnapShot: JAK-STAT signaling.Cell. 2007; 131: 612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Although STAT3 regulates cellular processes mainly through transcription-dependent functions of pSTAT3 in the nucleus, our data showing that U-STAT3 binds and may contribute to the sequestration of pFoxO proteins in the cytoplasm of activated T cells suggest a potentially important transcription-independent function of U-STAT3 in T cells. It is therefore of note that U-STAT3, induced to a high level due to activation of the STAT3 gene in response to ligands such as IL-6, binds to unphosphorylated NF-κB, in competition with IκB, to form a novel transcription factor complex in the cytoplasm (14Yang J. Liao X. Agarwal M.K. Barnes L. Auron P.E. Stark G.R. Unphosphorylated STAT3 accumulates in response to IL-6 and activates transcription by binding to NFκB.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1396-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it was also shown that the U-STAT3·p65/p50 trimolecular complex subsequently relocalizes from the cytoplasm into the nucleus with help from the nuclear localization signal of STAT3 and importin-α3-mediated mechanisms (14Yang J. Liao X. Agarwal M.K. Barnes L. Auron P.E. Stark G.R. Unphosphorylated STAT3 accumulates in response to IL-6 and activates transcription by binding to NFκB.Genes Dev. 2007; 21: 1396-1408Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). Similar to IκB interaction with and sequestration of unphosphorylated NF-κB in the cytoplasm, members of the 14-3-3 family proteins interact with and sequester pFoxO proteins in the cytoplasm (6Silhan J. Vacha P. Strnadova P. Vecer J. Herman P. Sulc M. Teisinger J. Obsilova V. Obsil T. 14-3-3 protein masks the DNA binding interface of Forkhead transcription factor FoxO4.J. Biol.

Structure/function relationships underlying regulation of FOXO transcription factors.Oncogene. 2008; 27: 2263-2275Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In concert with a recent report showing that 14-3-3ζ interacts with STAT3 and regulates its functions in plasma cells (22Zhang J. Chen F. Li W. Xiong Q. Yang M. Zheng P. Li C. Pei J. Ge F. 14-3-3ζ interacts with STAT3 and regulates its constitutive activation in multiple myeloma cells.PLoS One. 2012; 7: e29554Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we show here that 14-3-3 interacts with the FoxO·STAT3 complex. Taken together with our results showing the binding of STAT3 to the N-terminal region of FoxO1 that also interacts with 14-3-3, it may well be that an increase in pSTAT3/U-STAT3 in response to IL-10 or IL-6 signaling might promote formation of a more stable STAT3·pFoxO complex, with subsequent accumulation of the complex in the nucleus aided by the piggybacking of pFoxO on pSTAT3 NLS. Clearly, further studies are required to appreciate fully functional implications of the interaction between STAT3 and FoxO proteins in T cells. Nevertheless, data presented here suggest STAT3 as a convergence point for mechanisms that regulate cellular quiescence and T cell activation (Fig. 6), with STAT3 serving as a gatekeeper that determines whether T cells remain quiescent or proliferate by modulating FoxO nuclear/cytoplasmic localization in response to TCR and cytokine signals.

https://openalex.org/W2100763429,"Cells undergo apoptosis through two major pathways, the extrinsic pathway (death receptor pathway) and the intrinsic pathway (the mitochondrial pathway). These two pathways can be linked by caspase-8-activated truncated Bid formation. Very recently, death receptor 6 (DR6) was shown to be involved in the neurodegeneration observed in Alzheimer disease. DR6, also known as TNFRSF21, is a relatively new member of the death receptor family, and it was found that DR6 induces apoptosis when it is overexpressed. However, how the death signal mediated by DR6 is transduced intracellularly is not known. To this end, we have examined the roles of caspases, apoptogenic mitochondrial factor cytochrome c, and the Bcl-2 family proteins in DR6-induced apoptosis. Our data demonstrated that Bax translocation is absolutely required for DR6-induced apoptosis. On the other hand, inhibition of caspase-8 and knockdown of Bid have no effect on DR6-induced apoptosis. Our results strongly suggest that DR6-induced apoptosis occurs through a new pathway that is different from the type I and type II pathways through interacting with Bax.

Our results strongly suggest that DR6-induced apoptosis occurs through a new pathway that is different from the type I and type II pathways through interacting with Bax."
https://openalex.org/W2065939105,"Hyaluronan (HA) is a glycosaminoglycan polymer found in the extracellular matrix of virtually all mammalian tissues. Recent work has suggested a role for small, fragmented HA polymers in initiating innate defense responses in immune cells, endothelium, and epidermis through interaction with innate molecular pattern recognition receptors, such as TLR4. Despite these advances, little is known regarding the effect of fragmented HA at the intestinal epithelium, where numerous pattern recognition receptors act as sentinels of an innate defense response that maintains epithelial barrier integrity in the presence of abundant and diverse microbial challenges. Here we report that HA fragments promote expression of the innate antimicrobial peptide human β-defensin 2 (HβD2) in intestinal epithelial cells. Treatment of HT-29 colonic epithelial cells with HA fragment preparations resulted in time- and dose-dependent up-regulated expression of HβD2 protein in a fragment size-specific manner, with 35-kDa HA fragment preparations emerging as the most potent inducers of intracellular HβD2. Furthermore, oral administration of specific-sized HA fragments promotes the expression of an HβD2 ortholog in the colonic epithelium of both wild-type and CD44-deficient mice but not in TLR4-deficient mice. Together, our observations suggest that a highly size-specific, TLR4-dependent, innate defense response to fragmented HA contributes to intestinal epithelium barrier defense through the induction of intracellular HβD2 protein."
https://openalex.org/W1969275721,"Activation of voltage-gated sodium (Na(v)) channels initiates and propagates action potentials in electrically excitable cells. β-Scorpion toxins, including toxin IV from Centruroides suffusus suffusus (CssIV), enhance activation of Na(V) channels. CssIV stabilizes the voltage sensor in domain II in its activated state via a voltage-sensor trapping mechanism. Amino acid residues required for the action of CssIV have been identified in the S1-S2 and S3-S4 extracellular loops of domain II. The extracellular loops of domain III are also involved in toxin action, but individual amino acid residues have not been identified. We used site-directed mutagenesis and voltage clamp recording to investigate amino acid residues of domain III that are involved in CssIV action. In the IIISS2-S6 loop, five substitutions at four positions altered voltage-sensor trapping by CssIV(E15A). Three substitutions (E1438A, D1445A, and D1445Y) markedly decreased voltage-sensor trapping, whereas the other two substitutions (N1436G and L1439A) increased voltage-sensor trapping. These bidirectional effects suggest that residues in IIISS2-S6 make both positive and negative interactions with CssIV. N1436G enhanced voltage-sensor trapping via increased binding affinity to the resting state, whereas L1439A increased voltage-sensor trapping efficacy. Based on these results, a three-dimensional model of the toxin-channel interaction was developed using the Rosetta modeling method. These data provide additional molecular insight into the voltage-sensor trapping mechanism of toxin action and define a three-point interaction site for β-scorpion toxins on Na(V) channels. Binding of α- and β-scorpion toxins to two distinct, pseudo-symmetrically organized receptor sites on Na(V) channels acts synergistically to modify channel gating and paralyze prey."

Although the antiresorptive action of estrogen arises from the inhibition of the MAPK JNK, the mechanism of its effect on the osteoblast remains unclear. Here, we report that the anabolic action of estrogen in mice occurs, at least in part, through oxytocin (OT) produced by osteoblasts in bone marrow. We show that the absence of OT receptors (OTRs) in OTR−/− osteoblasts or attenuation of OTR expression in silenced cells inhibits estrogen-induced osteoblast differentiation, transcription factor up-regulation, and/or OT production in vitro. In vivo, OTR−/− mice, known to have a bone formation defect, fail to display increases in trabecular bone volume, cortical thickness, and bone formation in response to estrogen. Furthermore, osteoblast-specific Col2.3-Cre+/OTRfl/fl mice, but not TRAP-Cre+/OTRfl/fl mice, mimic the OTR−/− phenotype and also fail to respond to estrogen. These data attribute the phenotype of OTR deficiency to an osteoblastic rather than an osteoclastic defect.

https://openalex.org/W1999254509,"Campylobacter jejuni is the major worldwide cause of bacterial gastroenteritis. C. jejuni possesses an extensive repertoire of carbohydrate structures that decorate both protein and non-protein surface-exposed structures. An N-linked glycosylation system encoded by the pgl gene cluster mediates the synthesis of a rigidly conserved heptasaccharide that is attached to protein substrates or released as free oligosaccharide in the periplasm. Removal of N-glycosylation results in reduced virulence and impeded host cell attachment. Since the N-glycan is conserved, the N-glycosylation system is also an attractive option for glycoengineering recombinant vaccines in Escherichia coli. To determine whether non-canonical N-glycans are present in C. jejuni, we utilized high throughput glycoproteomics to characterize C. jejuni JHH1 and identified 93 glycosylation sites, including 34 not previously reported. Interrogation of these data allowed the identification of a phosphoethanolamine (pEtN)-modified variant of the N-glycan that was attached to multiple proteins. The pEtN moiety was attached to the terminal GalNAc of the canonical N-glycan. Deletion of the pEtN transferase eptC removed all evidence of the pEtN-glycan but did not globally influence protein reactivity to patient sera, whereas deletion of the pglB oligosaccharyltransferase significantly reduced reactivity. Transfer of eptC and the pgl gene cluster to E. coli confirmed the addition of the pEtN-glycan to a target C. jejuni protein. Significantly reduced, yet above background levels of pEtN-glycan were also observed in E. coli not expressing eptC, suggesting that endogenous E. coli pEtN transferases can mediate the addition of pEtN to N-glycans.

Here we report the identification of multiple proteins modified with an N-linked glycan displaying an additional moiety of +123.01 Da, consistent with the presence of pEtN. High resolution tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) confirmed that pEtN was attached to the terminal GalNAc of the canonical N-glycan rather than as a direct modification of the protein substrates. Deletion of eptC (cj0256) from C. jejuni JHH1 confirmed that EptC generates the pEtN-glycan. Heterologous expression of EptC in combination with the pgl cluster in E. coli led to the production of a pEtN-glycan-modified C. jejuni substrate protein (AcrA (44Feldman M.F. Wacker M. Hernandez M.

Modification with pEtN may influence C. jejuni and host-pathogen structure-function relationships mediated by the N-linked glycan. Bacterial strains used in this study are provided in supplemental Table S1. C. jejuni were cultured in parallel on 100 individual Skirrow's agar plates in a micro-aerophilic environment of 5% O2, 5% CO2, and 90% N2 at 37 °C for 48 h. Collection of cells and generation of protein extracts for glycoproteomics were as previously described (27Scott N.E. Parker B.L. Connolly A.M. Paulech J. Edwards A.V. Crossett B. Falconer L.

Growth of C. jejuni wild-type, and deletion/complementation mutants was performed in Mueller-Hinton (MH) or brain heart infusion (BHI) medium supplemented with 1% yeast extract and 7% blood (BHI+). Escherichia coli were grown in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth or on agar at 37 °C under ambient oxygen conditions. Where required for selection, 30 μg/ml kanamycin, 25 μg/ml chloramphenicol, 25 μg/ml trimethoprim, and 100 μg/ml ampicillin were used. Dried proteins were resuspended in 6 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 40 mm NH4HCO3, and reduced/alkylated before digestion with Lys-C (1/200 w/w) and then trypsin (1/50 w/w) as previously described (27Scott N.E.

Briefly, for pepsin digests, samples were diluted 1:4 with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and adjusted to a pH of ∼2.5 with 10% TFA. 1:25 (w/w) of pepsin to protein was added, and digestion was allowed to proceed for 24 h at 25 °C. For thermolysin digestion, samples were adjusted to a dilution of 1:4 with 100 mm NH4HCO3, and 1:25 (w/w) thermolysin to protein added. Samples were incubated for 24 h at 25 °C. All peptide digests were dialyzed against ultrapure water overnight using a Mini Dialysis kit with a molecular mass cutoff of 1000 Da (Amersham Biosciences) and on completion were collected and lyophilized. ZIC-HILIC enrichment was performed according to Scott et al. (27Scott N.E. Parker B.L. Connolly A.M. Paulech J. Edwards A.V. Crossett B. Falconer L. Kolarich D. Djordjevic S.P. Højrup P. Packer N.H.

https://openalex.org/W2046821085,"Polyubiquitination of misfolded proteins, especially K63-linked polyubiquitination, is thought to be associated with the formation of inclusion bodies. However, it is not well explored whether appropriate editing of the different types of ubiquitin linkages by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) affects the dynamics of inclusion bodies. In this study, we report that a specific DUB, ataxin-3, is required for the efficient recruitment of the neurodegenerative disease-associated protein copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) to aggresomes. The overexpression of ataxin-3 promotes mutant SOD1 aggresome formation by trimming K63-linked polyubiquitin chains. Moreover, knockdown of ataxin-3 decreases mutant SOD1 aggresome formation and increases cell death induced by mutant SOD1. Thus, our data suggest that the sequestration of misfolded SOD1 into aggresomes, which is driven by ataxin-3, plays an important role in attenuating protein misfolding-induced cell toxicity."
https://openalex.org/W1978744585,"We experience the world serially rather than simultaneously. A century of research on human and nonhuman animals has suggested that the first experience in a series of two or more is cognitively privileged. We report three experiments designed to test the effect of first position on implicit preference and choice using targets that range from individual humans and social groups to consumer goods. Experiment 1 demonstrated an implicit preference to buy goods from the first salesperson encountered and to join teams encountered first, even when the difference in encounter is mere seconds. In Experiment 2 the first of two consumer items presented in quick succession was more likely to be chosen. In Experiment 3 an alternative hypothesis that first position merely accentuates the valence of options was ruled out by demonstrating that first position enhances preference for the first even when it is evaluatively negative in meaning (a criminal). Together, these experiments demonstrate a “first is best” effect and we offer possible interpretations based on evolutionary mechanisms of this “bound” on rational behavior and suggest that automaticity of judgment may be a helpful principle in clarifying previous inconsistencies in the empirical record on the effects of order on preference and choice."
https://openalex.org/W1993630760,"Signals derived from basal lamina components are important for developing three-dimensional architecture of epithelial tissues. Laminins consisting of α, β, and γ subunits in basal lamina play pivotal roles in the formation and maintenance of epithelial tissue structures. However, it remains unclear which laminin isoforms transmit signals and how epithelial cells receive them to regulate multiple developmental processes. In three-dimensional culture of a liver progenitor cell line, Hepatic Progenitor Cells Proliferating on Laminin (HPPL), the cells establish apicobasal polarity and form cysts with a central lumen. Neutralizing antibody against β1 integrin blocked the formation and maintenance of the cyst structure, indicating that β1 integrin signaling was necessary throughout the morphogenesis. Although the addition of α1-containing laminin, a ligand of β1 integrin, induced cyst formation, it was dispensable for the maintenance of the cyst, suggesting that HPPL produces another ligand for β1 integrin to maintain the structure. Indeed, we found that HPPL produced α5-containing laminin, and siRNA against laminin α5 partially inhibited the lumen formation. In fetal liver, p75NTR(+) periportal fibroblasts and bile duct epithelial cells, known as cholangiocytes, expressed α1- and α5-containing laminins, respectively. In laminin α5 KO liver, cholangiocytes normally emerged, but the number of bile ducts was decreased. These results suggest that α1-containing laminin is sufficient as a component of the basal lamina for the commitment of bipotential liver progenitors to cholangiocytes and the apicobasal polarization, whereas α5-containing laminin is necessary for the formation of mature duct structures. Thus, α1- and α5-containing laminins differentially regulate the sequential events to form epithelial tissues via β1 integrin signals."
https://openalex.org/W2020928779,"Calpain has been implicated in acute myocardial injury after myocardial infarction (MI). However, the causal relationship between calpain and post-MI myocardial remodeling has not been fully understood. This study examined whether deletion of Capn4, essential for calpain-1 and calpain-2 activities, reduces myocardial remodeling and dysfunction following MI, and if yes, whether these effects of Capn4 deletion are associated with NF-κB signaling and inflammatory responses in the MI heart. A novel mouse model with cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of Capn4 (Capn4-ko) was employed. MI was induced by left coronary artery ligation. Deficiency of Capn4 dramatically reduced the protein levels and activities of calpain-1 and calpain-2 in the Capn4-ko heart. In vivo cardiac function was relatively improved in Capn4-ko mice at 7 and 30 days after MI when compared with their wild-type littermates. Deletion of Capn4 reduced apoptosis, limited infarct expansion, prevented left ventricle dilation, and reduced mortality in Capn4-ko mice. Furthermore, cardiomyocyte cross-sectional areas and myocardial collagen deposition were significantly attenuated in Capn4-ko mice, which were accompanied by down-regulation of hypertrophic genes and profibrotic genes. These effects of Capn4 knock-out correlated with restoration of IκB protein and inhibition of NF-κB activation, leading to suppression of proinflammatory cytokine expression and inflammatory cell infiltration in the Capn4-ko heart after MI. In conclusion, deficiency of Capn4 reduces adverse myocardial remodeling and myocardial dysfunction after MI.

After MI, ischemia-induced myocardial cell death is followed by progressive remodeling of the heart (1Sutton M.G. Sharpe N. Left ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction: pathophysiology and therapy.Circulation. 2000; 101: 2981-2988Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This well known sequence of events includes invasion of necrotic tissues by inflammatory cell infiltrates, activation and proliferation of resident cardiac fibroblasts, and breakdown of existing and generation of new extracellular matrix with scar formation, eventually leading to left ventricular (LV) dilatation and hypertrophy of the noninfarcted myocardium (2Frangogiannis N.G.

Changes related to remodeling begin in the acute period of MI and tend to continue long after, leading to LV dysfunction and severe heart failure in later phases.

Calpains are a family of calcium-dependent thiol proteases that participate in a wide variety of biological functions (4Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. The structure of calpain.J. Biochem. 2001; 129: 653-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 5Suzuki K. Hata S. Kawabata Y. Sorimachi H. Structure, activation, and biology of calpain.Diabetes. 2004; 53: S12-S18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fifteen gene products of the calpain family are expressed in mammals. Among them, calpain-1 (μ-form) and calpain-2 (m-form) are ubiquitously expressed, and other calpain family members have more limited tissue distribution. The two most extensively studied isoforms, calpain-1 and calpain-2, are heterodimers, differing in their calcium requirement for activation (∼50 μm for calpain-1 and ∼1000 μm for calpain-2) (6Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J. The calpain system.Physiol. Rev. 2003; 83: 731-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (2356) Google Scholar). They consist of a distinct large 80-kDa catalytic subunit encoded by the genes Capn1 and Capn2, respectively, and a common small 28-kDa regulatory subunit encoded by Capn4. The small subunit is indispensable for calpain-1 and calpain-2 stability and activity. Thus, Capn4 knock-out induces the impairment of calpain-1 and calpain-2 activity. Both calpain-1 and calpain-2 are tightly regulated by the intracellular concentration of free Ca2+ and by its endogenous inhibitor calpastatin (6Goll D.E. Thompson V.F. Li H. Wei W. Cong J.

A recent study showed that calpain-1 knock-out reduced whereas calpain-1 overexpression enhanced myocardial injury and dysfunction within 4 days after coronary occlusion (15Kang M.Y. Zhang Y.

We and others have demonstrated that calpain-1 is important in cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac proinflammatory responses under pathological conditions (16Li X. Li Y. Shan L. Shen E. Chen R.

Calpain inhibitors improve myocardial dysfunction and inflammation induced by endotoxin in rats.Shock. 2004; 21: 352-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Both apoptosis and inflammation contribute to post-MI remodeling (20Dorn 2nd, G.W. Apoptotic and non-apoptotic programmed cardiomyocyte death in ventricular remodeling.Cardiovasc.

Res. 2009; 81: 474-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Thus, calpain may be implicated in myocardial remodeling. Indeed, transgenic overexpression of calpain-1 is sufficient to induce dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure (22Galvez A.S. Diwan A. Odley A.M. Hahn H.S. Osinska H. Melendez J.G. Robbins J. Lynch R.A. Marreez Y. Dorn 2nd, G.W. Cardiomyocyte degeneration with calpain deficiency reveals a critical role in protein homeostasis.Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 1071-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). However, the role and mechanisms of calpain in myocardial remodeling after MI remain not fully understood. The NF-κB family plays an important role in inflammatory responses by promoting the expression of proinflammatory factors (23Kopp E.B. Ghosh S. NF-κB and Rel proteins in innate immunity.Adv. Immunol. 1995; 58: 1-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Members of the NF-κB family (p50, p52, p65, c-Rel, and Rel B) form homo or heterodimers (most commonly p50/p65, p50/p50, or p65/p65) that are bound to inhibitory IκB proteins in the cytosol (24Siebenlist U. Franzoso G. Brown K. Structure, regulation and function of NF-κB.Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2015) Google Scholar). Degradation of IκB frees NF-κB dimmers and allows translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus, where it can initiate transcription of target genes. Following MI, activation of NF-κB contributes to maladaptive LV remodeling and functional deterioration by promoting inflammatory responses (25Onai Y. Suzuki J. Maejima Y. Haraguchi G. Muto S. Itai A. Isobe M. Inhibition of NF-κB improves left ventricular remodeling and cardiac dysfunction after myocardial infarction.Am. J. Physiol. Heart Circ. Physiol. 2007; 292: H530-H538Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Calpain activation has been demonstrated to induce IκB degradation and NF-κB activation (26Shumway S.D. Maki M. Miyamoto S. The PEST domain of IκBα is necessary and sufficient for in vitro degradation by μ-calpain.J. Biol.

Impairment of NF-κB activation and modulation of gene expression by calpastatin.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2000; 279: C709-C716Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has never been shown whether the calpain-mediated NF-κB signaling is operative in the MI heart. In this study, we hypothesize that calpain activation induces IκB degradation and NF-κB activation, which mediate inflammatory responses in post-MI remodeling, and that cardiomyocyte-specific knock-out of Capn4 disrupts calpain-1 and calpain-2, inhibits cardiac inflammation, and reduces cardiac remodeling and dysfunction after MI.

All of the mice used in this study, including controls, were littermates of the same generation. Capn4PZ/PZ mice were used as wild-type control for Capn4-ko group. Adult mouse ventricle cardiomyocytes were isolated and cultured as described (17Li Y. Arnold J.M. Pampillo M. Babwah A.V. Peng T.

Under anesthesia with ketamine (100 mg/kg)/xylazine (5 mg/kg, intraperitoneally), adult male mice (about 2 months old) including Capn4-ko (49 mice), Capn4PZ/PZ (50 mice), and Tg-Cre (7 mice) were subjected to left coronary artery ligation as described previously (31Xiang F.L.

Sham-operated animals (10 Capn4-ko and 10 Capn4PZ/PZ mice) underwent the same surgical procedure without left coronary artery ligation. After surgery, buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg per 6 h, subcutaneously) were given for 48 h. Animals were subjected to the following experiments at 24 h, 7 days, and 30 days after MI. For survival study, a separate set of adult Capn4PZ/PZ and Capn4-ko mice received left coronary artery ligation surgery. Twenty-four hours after surgery, surviving mice including 61 Capn4PZ/PZ and 27 Capn4-ko mice were monitored and mortality was recorded for 30 days. Animals were lightly anesthetized with inhalant isoflurane (1%) and imaged using a 40-MHz linear array transducer attached to a preclinical ultrasound system (Vevo 2100, Visual Sonics) with nominal in-plane spatial resolution of 40 μm (axial) × 80 μm (lateral). M-mode and two-dimensional parasternal short-axis scans (133 frames/second) at the level of the papillary muscles were used to assess changes in LV end-systolic inner diameter (LVIDs), LV end-diastolic inner diameter (LVIDd), LV posterior wall thickness in end-diastole (LVPW;d) and in end-systole (LVPW;s), and fractional shortening (FS%). LV end-systolic volume (LV Vol;s) and end-diastolic volume (LV Vol;d) were acquired by 7/(2.4 + LVIDs) × LVIDs3 and 7/(2.4 + LVIDd) × LVIDd3, respectively. Mice were anesthetized with ketamine (100 mg/kg)/xylazine (5 mg/kg) and ventilated. The chest was opened, and a Scisense mouse pressure volume catheter (FTE-1212B-4518, 1.2French) was directly inserted into the LV via the apex to measure LV pressures and volumes as recently described (30Li Y.

To quantify the mast cells in the heart, cardiac tissue sections were stained with 0.02% toluidine blue in 0.25% acetic acid (pH 2.0–2.5). The number of mast cells in each heart section was evaluated (31Xiang F.L. Lu X. Hammoud L. Zhu P. Chidiac P. Robbins J. Feng Q.

To determine monocyte/macrophage infiltration, 4-μm sections were cut from cardiac frozen tissue samples embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT gel (Sakura Finetek), mounted on gelatin-coated glass microscope slides. Monocytes/macrophages were detected with a biotin-conjugated rat anti-mouse Mac-1 mAb (Cedarlane Laboratories) and then stained by a standard indirect avidin-biotin immunoperoxidase method using an Elite VECTASTAIN ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) as described previously (34Wang H.

Real-time RT-PCR was performed to analyze mRNA expression in noninfarcted areas for Capn1, Capn2, Capn4, β-myosin heavy chain (β-MHC), atrial natriuretic peptide, collagen I and III, TNF-α, Mcp-1, and GAPDH as described in our recent study (30Li Y.

The protein levels of IκB, p65, calpain-1, calpain-2, GAPDH, and histone 2A (H2A) were determined in noninfarcted areas by Western blot analysis as described previously (30Li Y. Ma J. Zhu H. Singh M.

Apoptosis was determined by assessing caspase-3 activity and TUNEL staining positive cells as described previously (35Shen E. Li Y. Li Y. Shan L. Zhu H. Feng Q. Arnold J.M. Peng T. Rac1 is required for cardiomyocyte apoptosis during hyperglycemia.Diabetes. 2009; 58: 2386-2395Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar).

All data were presented as mean ± S.D. Analysis of variance followed by Newman-Keuls test was performed for multigroup comparisons. Survival curves were created by the method of Kaplan and Meier, and compared by log-rank test. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Consistent with the previous studies (9Takahashi M. Tanonaka K. Yoshida H. Koshimizu M. Daicho T. Oikawa R. Takeo S.

Med. 2010; 26: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the mRNA levels of Capn1, Capn2, Capn4, and calpain enzymatic activities were elevated in the noninfarcted areas of Capn4PZ/PZ hearts at 7 and 30 days after MI when compared with their sham group (supplemental sFig. 1, A–D). To investigate the role of calpain-1 and calpain-2, we used cardiomyocyte-specific Capn4 knock-out mice because Capn4 is required for calpain-1 and calpain-2 activities. We first confirmed that Capn4 deletion resulted in a robust reduction of calpain-1 and calpain-2 protein (supplemental sFig. 1E) and disruption of calpain-1 and calpain-2 activities in myocardial tissues from Capn4-ko when compared with Capn4PZ/PZ hearts (supplemental sFig. 1F). We then induced MI on Capn4-ko mice and their wild-type littermates (Capn4PZ/PZ). To evaluate the effect of Capn4 knock-out on cardiac function, LV hemodynamic parameters were analyzed 7 and 30 days after MI. There was no significant difference in the heart rate between Capn4-ko and Capn4PZ/PZ sham and MI mice (supplemental Table 1). Seven days after MI, cardiac function of both Capn4-ko and Capn4PZ/PZ MI mice as determined by maximal positive and minimal negative first derivative of LV pressure (+dP/dtmax and −dP/dtmin) and ejection fraction value was significantly decreased when compared with sham groups (p < 0.05, Fig. 1, A–C). However, LV +dP/dtmax, −dP/dtmin, and ejection fraction value were greater in Capn4-ko versus Capn4PZ/PZ MI mice (Fig. 1, A–C). Thirty days after surgery, LV +dP/dtmax, −dP/dtmin, and ejection fraction value were significantly decreased in both Capn4-ko and Capn4PZ/PZ animals when compared with their sham groups (Fig. 1, D–F). However, cardiac-specific deletion of Capn4 relatively improved cardiac function (Fig. 1, D–F). To exclude potential effect of Cre transgene, we induced MI on Capn4PZ/PZ and Tg-Cre mice and analyzed cardiac function 7 days after MI. There was no difference between Capn4PZ/PZ and Tg-Cre mice (supplemental sFig. 2, A and B). To further assess cardiac function, echocardiography was performed 30 days after MI. The systolic function index percentage of fractional shortening showed a significant decrease in Capn4-ko and Capn4PZ/PZ MI mice when compared with their sham animals. However, cardiac-specific deletion of Capn4 exhibited relative improvement of cardiac function in Capn4-ko MI mice (Fig. 1G and supplemental Table 2). Consistently, the ratios of lung-to-body weight (supplemental sFig. 3) and dry-to-wet lung weight (Fig. 1H) indexes of lung congestion were increased in Capn4PZ/PZ MI mice when compared with sham animals but decreased in Capn4-ko MI mice. As a consequence, the post-MI mortality was decreased in Capn4-ko when compared with Capn4PZ/PZ mice (p < 0.05, Fig. 1I). Taken together, targeted disruption of calpain attenuates myocardial dysfunction and improves survival after MI. Thirty days after MI, echocardiographic analysis revealed that LV end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters were increased in Capn4-ko and Capn4PZ/PZ MI groups when compared with their shams, indicative of LV dilation and remodeling. However, these changes were significantly attenuated in Capn4-ko MI mice when compared with their wild-type MI groups (supplemental Table 2). These results suggest that disruption of calpain prevents LV dilation after MI. Hemodynamic analysis supported the inhibitory effects of Capn4 knock-out on the enlargement of LV chamber in MI mice. The LV end-diastolic volume and end-systolic volume were significantly reduced in Capn4-ko MI mice when compared with Capn4PZ/PZ MI group (supplemental Table 1). To substantiate the role of calpain in LV remodeling after MI, we analyzed infarct size, scar area, LV inner perimeter, and LV cavity size. Initial myocardial injury was not affected by Capn4 knock-out as 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining showed that infarct size did not differ between Capn4-ko and Capn4PZ/PZ groups at 24 h post-MI (Fig. 2, A–C). Seven days after MI, we assessed scar size at the level of the papillary muscles. The ratio of scar/cross-sectional area was smaller in Capn4-ko MI when compared with Capn4PZ/PZ MI mice (Fig. 2, D and E). In parallel with this alteration, deficiency of Capn4 reduced the ratio of inner scar length to inner perimeter and ratio of outer scar length to outer perimeter of LV chamber at the papillary level after MI (Fig. 2, F and G), supporting the limitation of LV infarct expansion in Capn4-ko MI when compared with Capn4PZ/PZ MI animals. Consistently, there was no difference of scar/cross-sectional area between Capn4PZ/PZ and Tg-Cre MI mice (supplemental sFig. 2C). These results suggest that inhibition of calpain prevents infarct expansion after MI. Similarly, LV cavity size was preserved in Capn4-ko when compared with Capn4PZ/PZ mice at 30 days after MI (Fig. 2H). The ratio of heart weight to body weight, a measure of cardiac hypertrophy, was similar between sham groups but was significantly increased in Capn4PZ/PZ MI mice. However, this ratio was significantly decreased in Capn4-ko MI when compared with Capn4PZ/PZ MI group (supplemental sFig. 4). MI-induced cardiac hypertrophy was further studied at the cellular level by histological analysis. The myocyte cross-sectional area was similar between sham groups but was s"
https://openalex.org/W2048608707,"The Saccharomyces cerevisiae Dmc1 and Tid1 proteins are required for the pairing of homologous chromosomes during meiotic recombination. This pairing is the precursor to the formation of crossovers between homologs, an event that is necessary for the accurate segregation of chromosomes. Failure to form crossovers can have serious consequences and may lead to chromosomal imbalance. Dmc1, a meiosis-specific paralog of Rad51, mediates the pairing of homologous chromosomes. Tid1, a Rad54 paralog, although not meiosis-specific, interacts with Dmc1 and promotes crossover formation between homologs. In this study, we show that purified Dmc1 and Tid1 interact physically and functionally. Dmc1 forms stable nucleoprotein filaments that can mediate DNA strand invasion. Tid1 stimulates Dmc1-mediated formation of joint molecules. Under conditions optimal for Dmc1 reactions, Rad51 is specifically stimulated by Rad54, establishing that Dmc1-Tid1 and Rad51-Rad54 function as specific pairs. Physical interaction studies show that specificity in function is not dictated by direct interactions between the proteins. Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that Rad51-Rad54 function together to promote intersister DNA strand exchange, whereas Dmc1-Tid1 tilt the bias toward interhomolog DNA strand exchange."
https://openalex.org/W2091549658,"The pathogenesis of most neurodegenerative diseases, including transmissible diseases like prion encephalopathy, inherited disorders like Huntington disease, and sporadic diseases like Alzheimer and Parkinson diseases, is intimately linked to the formation of fibrillar protein aggregates. It is becoming increasingly appreciated that prion-like intercellular transmission of protein aggregates can contribute to the stereotypical spread of disease pathology within the brain, but the mechanisms underlying the binding and uptake of protein aggregates by mammalian cells are largely uninvestigated. We have investigated the properties of polyglutamine (polyQ) aggregates that endow them with the ability to bind to mammalian cells in culture and the properties of the cell surface that facilitate such uptake. Binding and internalization of polyQ aggregates are common features of mammalian cells and depend upon both trypsin-sensitive and trypsin-resistant saturable sites on the cell surface, suggesting the involvement of cell surface proteins in this process. polyQ aggregate binding depends upon the presence of a fibrillar amyloid-like structure and does not depend upon electrostatic interaction of fibrils with the cell surface. Sequences in the huntingtin protein that flank the amyloid-forming polyQ tract also influence the extent to which aggregates are able to bind to cell surfaces."

https://openalex.org/W2063194689,"In vivo studies have shown that selenium is supplied to testis and brain by apoER2-mediated endocytosis of Sepp1. Although cultured cell lines have been shown to utilize selenium from Sepp1 added to the medium, the mechanism of uptake and utilization has not been characterized. Rat L8 myoblast cells were studied. They took up mouse Sepp1 from the medium and used its selenium to increase their glutathione peroxidase (Gpx) activity. L8 cells did not utilize selenium from Gpx3, the other plasma selenoprotein. Neither did they utilize it from Sepp1(Δ240-361), the isoform of Sepp1 that lacks the selenium-rich C-terminal domain. To identify Sepp1 receptors, a solubilized membrane fraction was passed over a Sepp1 column. The receptors apoER2 and Lrp1 were identified in the eluate by mass spectrometry. siRNA experiments showed that knockdown of apoER2, but not of Lrp1, inhibited (75)Se uptake from (75)Se-labeled Sepp1. The addition of protamine to the medium or treatment of the cells with chlorate also inhibited (75)Se uptake. Blockage of lysosome acidification did not inhibit uptake of Sepp1 but did prevent its digestion and thereby utilization of its selenium. These results indicate that L8 cells take up Sepp1 by an apoER2-mediated mechanism requiring binding to heparin sulfate proteoglycans. The presence of at least part of the selenium-rich C-terminal domain of Sepp1 is required for uptake. RT-PCR showed that mouse tissues express apoER2 in varying amounts. It is postulated that apoER2-mediated uptake of long isoform Sepp1 is responsible for selenium distribution to tissues throughout the body."

Here, we demonstrate that TTF-1 transactivated the expression of the epithelial tight junction molecules occludin (OCLN) and claudin-1 (CLDN1). We show that transcriptional activation occurred through a direct interaction of TTF-1 with the OCLN and CLDN1 promoters. Furthermore, in cells that lack TTF-1, exogenous TTF-1 expression dampened the inhibitory effect of TGF-β on occludin and claudin-1 content. Using cells derived from a genetically engineered mouse model of lung adenocarcinomas, we observed that silenced TTF-1 expression down-regulated occludin, which we supported with additional siRNA experiments. Finally, TTF-1 knockdown conferred human lung cancer cells resistance to anoikis, and expression of occludin restored cellular sensitivity to anoikis. Overexpression of occludin impeded migration and induced anoikis in lung carcinoma cells.

https://openalex.org/W2001708290,"The voltage-gated Kv1.3 K(+) channel in effector memory T cells serves as a new therapeutic target for multiple sclerosis. In our previous studies, the novel peptide ADWX-1 was designed and synthesized as a specific Kv1.3 blocker. However, it is unclear if and how ADWX-1 alleviates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a model for multiple sclerosis. In this study, the administration of ADWX-1 significantly ameliorated the rat experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model by selectively inhibiting CD4(+)CCR7(-) phenotype effector memory T cell activation. In contrast, the Kv1.3-specific peptide had little effect on CD4(+)CCR7(+) cells, thereby limiting side effects. Furthermore, we determined that ADWX-1 is involved in the regulation of NF-κB signaling through upstream protein kinase C-θ (PKCθ) in the IL-2 pathway of CD4(+)CCR7(-) cells. The elevated expression of Kv1.3 mRNA and protein in activated CD4(+)CCR7(-) cells was reduced by ADWX-1 engagement; however, an apparent alteration in CD4(+)CCR7(+) cells was not observed. Moreover, the selective regulation of the Kv1.3 channel gene expression pattern by ADWX-1 provided a further and sustained inhibition of the CD4(+)CCR7(-) phenotype, which depends on the activity of Kv1.3 to modulate its activation signal. In addition, ADWX-1 mediated the activation of differentiated Th17 cells through the CCR7(-) phenotype. The efficacy of ADWX-1 is supported by multiple functions, which are based on a Kv1.3(high) CD4(+)CCR7(-) T cell selectivity through two different pathways, including the classic channel activity-associated IL-2 pathway and the new Kv1.3 channel gene expression pathway."

https://openalex.org/W2069040308,"AMP-activated protein kinase, the ""energy sensor of the cell,"" responds to low cellular energy stores by regulating enzymes and transcription factors that allow the cell to adapt to limiting nutritional conditions. Snf1, the yeast ortholog of AMP-activated protein kinase, has an essential role in respiratory metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that includes activating the transcription factor Adr1. How Snf1 regulates Adr1 activity is poorly understood. We used an analog-sensitive allele, SNF1(as)(I132G), that is inhibited by 2-naphthylmethyl pyrazolopyrimidine 1 to study the role of Snf1 in transcriptional regulation of glucose-repressible genes. When Snf1(as) was inhibited at the time of glucose depletion, there was a promoter-specific response with some Snf1-dependent genes being activated by low levels of inhibitor, whereas all Snf1-dependent genes were inhibited at high levels. Transcript accumulation was more sensitive to Snf1(as) inhibition than Adr1 or RNA polymerase (pol) II binding or acetylation of promoter nucleosomes. When Snf1(as) was inhibited after gene activation, Adr1 and RNA pol II remained at promoters, and RNA pol II remained in the ORF with associated nascent transcripts. However, cytoplasmic mRNAs were lost at a rapid rate compared with their decay following chemical or genetic inactivation of RNA pol II.

The actin and plasminogen binding sites of GBS-PGK were identified using truncated GBS-PGK molecules, followed by peptide mapping. These experiments identified two actin and plasminogen binding sites located between amino acids 126–134 and 204–208 of the 398-amino acid-long GBS-PGK molecule. Substitution of the lysine residues within these regions with alanine resulted in significantly reduced binding to both actin and plasminogen. In addition, conversion of the glutamic acid residue at amino acid 133 to proline, the amino acid found at this position for the PGK protein of Streptococcus pneumoniae, also resulted in sign ificantly reduced binding to actin and plasminogen. These results demonstrate that the lysine residues at amino acid positions 126, 127, 130, 204, and 208 along with the glutamic acid residue at amino acid position 133 are necessary for actin and plasminogen binding by GBS-PGK.

In addition to plasminogen, GBS-PGK has also been demonstrated to bind the eukaryotic cytoskeletal protein actin (38.Boone T.J. Burnham C.D. Tyrrell G.J. Binding of group B streptococcal phosphoglycerate kinase to plasminogen and actin.Microb. Pathog. 2011; 51: 259-261Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Although the interaction between GBS-PGK and actin has not been established as a virulence characteristic, actin binding by surface-expressed GBS-PGK may contribute to adhesion as actin has been identified on the surface of a number of eukaryotic cells, including lymphocytes, monocytes, endothelial cells, and L cells (45.Sanders S.K.

Cell. 1996; 7: 1003-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). It has also been demonstrated that expression of GBS-PGK in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells causes disruption of the actin cytoskeleton (38.Boone T.J. Burnham C.D. Tyrrell G.J. Binding of group B streptococcal phosphoglycerate kinase to plasminogen and actin.Microb. Pathog. 2011; 51: 259-261Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar), suggesting that GBS-PGK may interact directly with the host cell actin cytoskeleton to contribute to GBS virulence. The extracellular location of GBS-PGK, along with its actin and plasminogen binding ability, suggests that GBS-PGK may contribute to GBS virulence. Similar to GAPDH and α-enolase from other streptococcal species, confirming the role of PGK in GBS virulence has been hampered by its role in glycolysis. Due to their essential role in metabolism, traditional knock-out mutagenesis is not possible. Site-directed mutagenesis, creating a glycolytically active enzyme that lacks the ability to bind host proteins, has previously been used to demonstrate a role for GAPDH and α-enolase in virulence of other streptococcal species (26.Bergmann S. Rohde M. Preissner K.T. Hammerschmidt S. The nine residue plasminogen-binding motif of the pneumococcal enolase is the major cofactor of plasmin-mediated degradation of extracellular matrix, dissolution of fibrin, and transmigration.Thromb.

Genomic DNA, isolated from this overnight culture, was used as a template to PCR amplify the pgk gene. The full-length gbs-pgk gene was PCR amplified using primers PGK-bamF (TTCGGATCCGCTAAATTGACT) and PGK-pstR (TTCCTGCAGTTATTTTCAGTCAATGC). The truncated gbs-pgk gene spanning amino acids 83–303 (TJB 1) was PCR-amplified using primers PGK1-bamF (TTCGGATCCGCTAAACTTGGTCAAGATGTTG) and PGK3-hinR (TTCAAGCTTTGATTTAGGACCGATGTCAAG).

The resulting amplicons were ligated into the expression plasmid pQE 30 and transformed into chemically competent Escherichia coli M15 carrying the plasmid pREP4. Full-length and truncated rGBS-PGK molecules were expressed and purified as described previously (38.Boone T.J. Burnham C.D. Tyrrell G.J. Binding of group B streptococcal phosphoglycerate kinase to plasminogen and actin.Microb. Pathog. 2011; 51: 259-261Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Actin and plasminogen binding by full-length and truncated rGBS-PGK molecules were assayed using ELISA as described previously (38.Boone T.J. Burnham C.D. Tyrrell G.J.

Actin (1 μg/well; Sigma-Aldrich) and plasminogen (0.1 μg/well; Sigma-Aldrich) were resuspended in 0.1 m sodium carbonate solution (pH 9.5) and immobilized to wells of a 96-well polystyrene plate (Maxi-sorp; NUNC, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Nepean, ON, CA) via 8 h of incubation at room temperature. Wells incubated with sodium carbonate solution containing no protein were used as a negative control. Wells were washed 1 × 10 min with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and incubated for 16 h with blocking buffer (5% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS) at room temperature. Wells were then washed 3 × 10 min with TBS and incubated with full-length or truncated rGBS-PGK molecules (15 or 0 μg/ml; in blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature. After this incubation, wells were washed 3 × 10 min with TBS and incubated with rabbit anti-rGBS-PGK antibodies (1:300 in blocking buffer) (38.Boone T.J. Burnham C.D. Tyrrell G.J.

Another wash, 3 × 10 min, with TBS was performed, and the plates were incubated with goat anti-rabbit-IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugated antibodies (1:200 in blocking buffer; Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at room temperature. Wells were then washed 3 × 10 min with TBS and developed for 30 min at room temperature with 100 μl of 4-nitrophenol phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich); development was stopped with 25 μl of NaOH (3 n). The absorbance at 405 nm (A405) was measured using an Athos LP400 microplate reader (Bio-Rad). Experiments were performed a total of nine times. The A405 measurements from the control wells were subtracted from those obtained from the experimental wells to control for any nonspecific binding. The final A405 measurements were compared with those obtained from standard curves containing decreasing amounts full-length or truncated rGBS-PGK (10–0.3125 ng/well; supplemental Fig. S1) to determine the amount of full-length and truncated rGBS-PGK molecules remaining in the wells. A peptide mapping procedure, similar to that described previously (27.Bergmann S. Wild D. Diekmann O. Frank R. Bracht D. Chhatwal G.S. Hammerschmidt S. Identification of a novel plasmin(ogen)-binding motif in surface displayed α-enolase of Streptococcus pneumoniae.Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 49: 411-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), was used to identify the actin and plasminogen binding regions of GBS-PGK. The GBS-PGK region corresponding to amino acids 83–303 (TJB 1) was divided into 21 peptides (1–21); each peptide was 20-amino acids in length and overlapped the previous peptide by 10 amino acids (Peptide 2.0, Inc. Chantilly, VA). Peptides were ordered as crude peptides, and their amino acid sequences are listed in Table 1. Peptides were fixed to nitrocellulose membranes (15 μg/spot) using the biodot apparatus (Bio-Rad). The membranes were washed for 15 min with TBS, incubated 30 min with blocking buffer (5% BSA, 0.1% Tween 20 in TBS), washed 15 min with TBS, and incubated with either actin or plasminogen (20 μg/ml in blocking buffer; Sigma-Aldrich) for 16 h at 4 °C. For a positive control, rGBS-PGK was also fixed as a spot to the nitrocellulose membrane (15 μg). As a negative control, duplicate membranes containing immobilized peptides were incubated with blocking buffer only for 16 h at 4 °C and assayed in parallel with the experimental membranes. After incubation, the membranes were washed 15 min with TBS and incubated with either mouse anti-actin (clone C4; Millipore, Billerica, MA) or mouse anti-plasminogen (clone 3E6; Sigma-Aldrich) antibodies (1:1000 in blocking buffer) for 2 h at 4 °C. Membranes were washed 3 × 15 min with TBST (0.1% Tween 20 in TBS), 2 × 15 min with TBS before incubating with goat anti-mouse-IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (1:10,000 in blocking buffer; Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed 3 × 15 min with TBST and 2 × 15 min with TBS before developing with SigmaFast BCIP/NBT (Sigma-Aldrich) for 5 min. Membrane development was stopped with three changes of distilled water.TABLE 1Peptides used in studyPeptideSequenceAmino acidsBound byPGK 1aklgqdvvfpgvtrgaklee83–102PGK 2gvtrgakleeainaledgqv93–112PGK 3ainaledgqvllventrfed103–122PGK 4llventrfedvdgkkesknd113–132Actin and plasminogenPGK 5vdgkkeskndeelgkywasl123–142Actin and plasminogenPGK 6eelgkywaslgdgifvndaf133–152PGK 7gdgifvndafgtahrahasn143–162PGK 8gtahrahasnvgisanveka153–172Actin and plasminogenPGK 9vgisanvekavagfllenei163–182PGK 10vagflleneiayiqeavetp173–192PGK 11ayiqeavetperpfvailgg183–202PGK 12erpfvailggskvsdkigvi193–212ActinPGK 13skvsdkigvienllekadkv203–222Actin and plasminogenPGK 14enllekadkvligggmtytf213–232Actin and plasminogenPGK 15ligggmtytfykaqgieign223–242ActinPGK 16ykaqgieignslveedkldv233–252PGK 17slveedkldvakdlleksng243–262PGK 18akdlleksngklilpvdske253–272PlasminogenPGK 19klilpvdskeanafagytev263–282PGK 20anafagytevrdtegeavse273–292PGK 21dtegeavsegflgldigpks284–303 Open table in a new tab The gbs-pgk gene was PCR-amplified using the primers PGK-pstF (CGCCTGCAGATGGCTAAATTGACTGTTAAAGACGTT) and PGK-hinR, ligated into the plasmid pUC19 and transformed into chemically competent E. coli DH5α.

https://openalex.org/W1984259171,"Defects in the insulin-signaling pathway may lead to the development of skeletal muscle insulin resistance, which is one of the earliest abnormalities detected in individuals with the metabolic syndrome and predisposes them to develop type 2 diabetes. Previous studies have shown that deletion of the mouse sequestosome 1/p62 gene results in mature-onset obesity that progresses to insulin and leptin resistance and, ultimately, type 2 diabetes. Sequestosome 1/p62 is involved in receptor-mediated signal transduction and functions as an intracellular signal modulator or adaptor protein. Insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) plays a central role in transducing the insulin signal via phosphorylation, protein-protein interactions, and protein modifications. Mapping studies demonstrated that the SH(2) domain at the amino terminus of sequestosome 1/p62 interacts with IRS-1 upon insulin stimulation. Further, IRS-1 interacts with p62 through its YMXM motifs at Tyr-608, Tyr-628, and/or Tyr-658 in a manner similar to its interaction with p85 of phosphoinositol 3-kinase. Overexpression of p62 increased phosphorylation of Akt, GLUT4 translocation, and glucose uptake, providing evidence that p62 participates in the insulin-signaling pathway through its interactions with IRS-1."

Little is known concerning how these enzymes target their specific substrates. Here we show that recognition of HLA-DR by MARCH proteins is complex. Several features associated with the transmembrane domain and bordering regions influence the overall efficiency of receptor internalization. A cluster of residues at the interface of the lipid bilayer and the cytosol plays the most important role in MARCH8 recognition of HLA-DRβ. Variation in this sequence also determines specificity of MARCH9 for HLA-DQ. Residues located in helical face four of HLA-DRβ together with a charged residue at the boundary with the stalk region also contribute significantly to recognition. Truncation analysis suggested that a dileucine-like motif in the DRβ cytoplasmic tail influences the efficiency of co-localization of HLA-DR with MARCH8. The DRβ-encoded acceptor lysine functioned optimally when placed in its natural location relative to the bilayer. In the DRα/DRβ dimer most other amino acids in the cytoplasmic tail could be substituted for alanine with minimal influence on function. Our data support a model whereby multiple features of HLA-DR are involved in substrate recognition by MARCH8. The single most important region is located at the interface between the transmembrane domain and the cytosol.

https://openalex.org/W2051420187,"Bipolar mitotic spindle organization is fundamental to faithful chromosome segregation. Furry (Fry) is an evolutionarily conserved protein implicated in cell division and morphology. In human cells, Fry localizes to centrosomes and spindle microtubules in early mitosis, and depletion of Fry causes multipolar spindle formation. However, it remains unknown how Fry controls bipolar spindle organization. This study demonstrates that Fry binds to polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) through the polo-box domain of Plk1 in a manner dependent on the cyclin-dependent kinase 1-mediated Fry phosphorylation at Thr-2516. Fry also binds to Aurora A and promotes Plk1 activity by binding to the polo-box domain of Plk1 and by facilitating Aurora A-mediated Plk1 phosphorylation at Thr-210. Depletion of Fry causes centrosome and centriole splitting in mitotic spindles and reduces the kinase activity of Plk1 in mitotic cells and the accumulation of Thr-210-phosphorylated Plk1 at the spindle poles. Our results suggest that Fry plays a crucial role in the structural integrity of mitotic centrosomes and in the maintenance of spindle bipolarity by promoting Plk1 activity at the spindle poles in early mitosis."

Neurotransmitter-mediated communication between presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes of neurons is the fundamental currency for brain function. The precise organization and dynamic changes of presynaptic and postsynaptic protein components underlie the physiological regulation of synaptic efficacy known as synaptic plasticity. Synaptic plasticity is a central mechanism for the development of the brain and underlies higher cognitive functions of the brain, such as learning and memory. Many studies in neuroscience focusing on the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms of synaptic plasticity have demonstrated the importance of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate (AMPA) receptors (AMPA-R), 3The abbreviations used are: AMPA-RAMPA receptors4.1Nprotein 4.1WGAwheat germ agglutininPSDpostsynaptic densityco-IPco-immunoprecipitationIPedimmunoprecipitatedZO-1Zonula occludens-1lNP1neuronal pentraxin-1GRP7878-kDa glucose-regulated proteinGEFguanine nucleotide exchange factor. the major excitatory neurotransmitter receptor in the brain. The regulation of activity and the trafficking of AMPA-Rs is a potent way of modulating synaptic plasticity underlying many neurobiological functions such as long term potentiation, long term depression, homeostatic synaptic scaling, and learning and memory.

Forebrains, including the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (about 1.0 g together from the 3.5-week-old rat), were used as tissue for immunoprecipitation (IP) with GluA1 antibody. Cerebella were used for IP with GluA4 antibody. The brain tissues were added to Buffer A and homogenized using a glass/Teflon homogenizer. The lysate was centrifuged for 10 min at 1400 × g at 4 °C. The pellet was saved as P1. The supernatant (S1) was collected and spun again at 13,800 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The second supernatant (S2) and pellet (P2) were saved. The S1, S2, P1, and P2 were either used immediately or stored at −80 °C. Buffer B was made with PBS by freshly adding 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, protease inhibitor mixture, and additional detergents as indicated for each experiment. The P2 was resuspended in Buffer B, mixed gently for 60 min at 4 °C on a rolling platform, and spun down at 14,000 × g for 15 min to collect the supernatant including solubilized proteins. From the solubilized brain P2, matured membrane proteins were enriched through wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) chromatography as described in a previous study (23.Kang M.G. Chen C.C. Felix R. Letts V.A. Frankel W.N. Mori Y. Campbell K.P. Biochemical and biophysical evidence for γ2 subunit association with neuronal voltage-activated Ca2+ channels.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 32917-32924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, the solubilized P2 was mixed with WGA (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and incubated overnight. After washing with Buffer B, WGA-bound proteins were eluted using N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (Sigma). AMPA-R complexes were then purified through medium-scale IP as below. For this medium scale IP, 100 μg of affinity-purified GluA1 antibody (JH1816) and GluA4 antibody (JH4303) recognizing the N-terminal epitope of GluA1 and GluA4 subunit was used, respectively. Antibodies were bound to Protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) by incubating at 4 °C for 90 min. To show the specificity of IP, as a negative control, one group of samples was incubated with a synthetic peptide that was used to raise this antibody (peptide block): RH95 for JH1816 and RH258 for JH4303. The solubilized proteins in Buffer B were first incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads for 90 min as a preclearing process and then incubated with the antibody-protein A-Sepharose beads at 4 °C for 3 h on a rolling platform. After washing the beads three times with three-bed volumes of ice-cold Buffer B, proteins bound to the antibodies were eluted with the protein gel loading buffer (2% SDS, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% bromphenol blue, 2% glycerol, and 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) and applied to SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) followed by silver staining and mass spectrometry or Western blot analysis as below. In some cases the AMPA-R complexes bound to the GluA1 antibody were eluted out using the synthetic peptide (RH95) that was used for the development of the GluA1 antibody (JH1816). Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE using Criterion Precast Gels (Bio-Rad) and stained with Bio-Safe Coomassie stain (Bio-Rad) or Silver Stain PlusTM (Bio-Rad) as per the manufacturer's instruction. Protein bands were excised from the gel in 150-mm Petri dishes and further sliced into ∼1 mm cubic pieces. The gel pieces were rinsed with 50% methanol for 10 min twice. For proteins stained with Coomassie Blue, and the gels were re-swollen in 50 μl of 20 mm NH4HCO3 for 10 min. After discarding the excess buffer, the gels were dehydrated in 50 μl of CH3CN for 10 min. For bands stained with silver staining, 30 μl of a 1:1 mix of 30 mm potassium ferricyanide and 100 mm sodium thiosulfate were added to the gel and incubated until the brown color disappeared. The buffer was discarded, and the gel pieces were rinsed with 200 μl of nano-pure water. The water was removed, and the gel pieces were rinsed with 100 μl of ammonium bicarbonate (100 mm, pH 8, Sigma). The gel pieces were then lyophilized to dryness in a SpeedVac (ThermoSavant, Holbrook, NY), reduced with DTT (100 μl, 10 mm, pH 8) at 57 °C for 1 h, and alkylated with 100 μl of iodoacetamide (55 mm, pH 8) in the dark at room temperature for 45 min. The supernatant was then removed, and the gel pieces were washed with 100 μl of ammonium bicarbonate (100 mm, pH 8), dehydrated with acetonitrile, and lyophilized to dryness in the SpeedVac. Gels were re-swollen in 50 μl of 20 mm NH4HCO3, dehydrated in 100 μl of CH3CN for 10 min, re-swelled and dehydrated once more, and dried using the SpeedVac. The dried gels were re-swollen in 25 μl of 10 ng/μl trypsin (Sequencing Grade Modified Trypsin, Promega, Madison, WI) in 20 mm NH4HCO3 for 60 min on ice. After removing the excess buffer, the gels were covered in 25 μl of 20 mm NH4HCO3 and digested at 37 °C overnight. In addition to the resulting supernatant, the digested peptides were further extracted from the gel once in 25 μl of 20 mm NH4HCO3 and 3 times in 50 μl of 50% CH3CN and 5% formic acid with gentle agitation using vortex each 20 min. All the extracts were combined and dried in the SpeedVac. All tubes and tips used in sample preparations for mass spectrometry were rinsed with CH3CN before use. After extracted peptides were cleaned using C18 ZipTips (Millipore, Bedford, MA) as per the manufacturer's instruction, 1 μl of peptide samples were mixed with 1 μl of matrix solution (10 mg/ml of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% CH3CN, 0.3% trifluoroacetic acid) on a 100-well stainless steel target plate (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) by pipetting and air-dried. Spectra of peptides masses were analyzed using Voyager DE-STR MALDI time of flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) (Applied Biosystems) in the reflectron mode. The system was calibrated using the control peptides, and mass spectra of sample peptides were acquired based on this calibration. Obtained spectra were further calibrated by the internal control using the trypsin peptide fragment masses. Peptide peaks were revealed by de-isotoping the spectra, and the masses of the peaks were obtained automatically after setting the threshold to eliminate background signals. Collections of peptide masses were then put into Protein Prospector search engine and analyzed for their matches with peptide mass finger print of reported proteins. Databases were downloaded from EMBL-EBI. These databases were then indexed with trypsin as an enzyme, and maximum 2 internal cleavage sites were allowed. Once a protein was identified with several peptide matches, we made sure either that they belong to rat or that peptide sequences are identical to that of rat. LC-MS/MS and data base analysis were performed as described previously (24.Guo Y. Ma S.F. Grigoryev D. Van Eyk J. Garcia J.G. 1-DE MS and 2-D LC-MS analysis of the mouse bronchoalveolar lavage proteome.Proteomics. 2005; 5: 4608-4624Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Briefly, the extracted and digested peptides were loaded to a reverse-phase C18 precolumn (Shimogyo, Kyoto). The precolumn was connected via Teflon tubing to a C18 analytical column (Waters, Milford, MA) with an integrated emitter tip (2–4-μm inner diameter). Peptides were eluted into a LCQ DECA XP Plus mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA) with an Agilent 1100 HPLC system. The mass spectrometer was operated in a data-dependent mode in which every MS scan was followed by MS/MS scans on the top five most abundant ions (isolation window = 1.5 Da; dynamic exclusion: repeat count = 1, repeat duration = 0.5 min, duration = 1 min). Protein identification was performed by searching the raw spectra against nr data base using the Bioworks 3.1 software package (Thermo Electron, San Jose, CA) with TurboSequest algorithm. The NCBI nr data base was indexed with trypsin as an enzyme (two internal cleavage sites as maximum). Proteins were accepted only when at least two peptides passed our criteria: ΔCn is above 0.1 and Xcorr values of greater than 3 for triple-, 2.3 for double-, and 2 for single-charged ions. All positively identified peptides were manually confirmed. For positive protein identifications from rat, we made sure that the peptides identified for that protein from nr data base match the peptide sequences from rat. Western blot analyses were performed as described previously (11.Boehm J. Kang M.G. Johnson R.C. Esteban J. Huganir R.L. Malinow R.

Südhof, Stanford University). The P1, S1, S2, and P2 fractions were prepared as described above. To purify presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins, further subcellular fractionation was performed with the P2 as described previously (27.Kang M.G. Chen C.C. Wakamori M. Hara Y. Mori Y. Campbell K.P. A functional AMPA receptor-calcium channel complex in the postsynaptic membrane.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2006; 103: 5561-5566Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Briefly, after hypo-osmotic lysis of the P2, synaptosomal membrane proteins were purified through a discontinuous sucrose gradient. From the synaptosomal membrane proteins, presynaptic proteins were solubilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. The insolubilized fraction was considered as postsynaptic density (PSD) proteins. Cortical neuron cultures were prepared, maintained, immuno-stained, and analyzed as previously described (28.Kang M.G. Guo Y. Huganir R.L. AMPA receptor and GEF-H1/Lfc complex regulates dendritic spine development through RhoA signaling cascade.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 3549-3554Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Immuno-stained neurons were imaged using a confocal microscopy system based on Nikon A1 with a 60× oil immersion objective. The images were analyzed using ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD) and NIS-Element software (Nikon). Except one for ERC2, commercial primary antibodies were used for staining: Zizimin1 (Santa Cruz), ZO-1 (Santa Cruz), MAP2 (PCK-554P, Covance), GluA1 (Millipore). All secondary antibodies were purchased from Molecular Probes/Invitrogen. Co-localization between GluA1 and one of the novel interactors (Zizimin1, ZO-1, or ERC2) was quantified using the co-localization analysis tool in the NIS-Elements software (Nikon). In the analysis, Manders' overlap coefficients were given and used to obtain the co-localization values as percentages between GluA1 and a protein of interest. These values were shown as the mean ± S.E. Images were taken from at least 10 different neurons cultured from at least three different animals. Statistical analyses of the co-localization were done with one-way analysis of variance followed by Tukey's multiple comparison tests, and the probability (p) of 0.05 or less was considered significant. Statistical analyses were performed using SigmaPlot (Version 12, SYSTAT Software). Among several techniques that could be used for isolation of AMPA-R complexes, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) was employed in medium scale as this can isolate in vivo protein complexes. This technique was successfully used to identify components of the neuronal ion channel complexes in previous studies (20.Husi H. Ward M.A. Choudhary J.S. Blackstock W.P. Grant S.G. Proteomic analysis of NMDA receptor-adhesion protein signaling complexes.Nat. Neurosci. 2000; 3: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar, 22.Müller C.S. Haupt A. Bildl W. Schindler J.

U.S.A. 2010; 107: 14950-14957Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Before a medium-scale co-IP of the AMPA-R complexes, some pilot experiments were performed in small scale to determine optimal conditions for the co-IP. Focus was placed on three aspects; 1) choice of antibody, 2) concentration of salt for washing, and 3) detergent conditions. First, two different antibodies raised against GluA1 were tested for co-IP. One was raised against the N terminus of GluA1, which is an extracellular domain, and another was raised against the very C terminus of GluA1 an intracellular domain containing type-I PDZ ligand. As shown in supplemental Fig. 1A, both antibodies immunoprecipitated (IPed) GluA1 specifically, and this immunoprecipitation (IP) was blocked by preincubation of the antibodies with the corresponding antigen peptides (peptide block: Pep+). The peptide block was always used as a negative control in our experiments as even a preimmune serum (normal IgG in supplemental Fig. 1A) could pull down many proteins non-specifically. Although many proteins were specifically co-IPed with both antibodies of GluA1, more proteins were co-IPed with the anti-GluA1-N terminus antibody. This is likely due to the fact that many of these protein interactions occur through the C terminus of GluA1 and may be blocked by the anti-GluA1 C-terminal antibodies. Therefore, for both GluA1 and GluA4 IP, N-terminal antibodies were used for the medium-scale co-IP. Second, based on our pilot experiments for optimization of washing stringency in co-IP, the salt concentration in the washing buffer of co-IP was set at 150 mm of NaCl. For example, when the salt concentration in the washing buffer was raised to 500 mm, many weak protein bands specifically co-IPed with 150 mm salt became too weak to be detected in our gel staining (compare supplemental Fig. 1, A and B). Third, detergent conditions were empirically determined. Out of many kinds of detergent, we decided to use Triton X-100 for two main reasons. Triton X-100 has been used for most of the biochemical analysis of AMPA-R, as it is effective both in extracting AMPA-Rs and keeping protein-protein interactions intact (29.Blackstone C.D. Moss S.J. Martin L.J. Levey A.I. Price D.L. Huganir R.L. Biochemical characterization and localization of a non-N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor in rat brain.J. Neurochem. 1992; 58: 1118-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Triton X-100 is also compatible with mass spectrometry in low concentration. Among different concentrations of Triton X-100 tested from 0.1% to 2.0%, the condition was set to 0.5% based on the yield of co-IP and the signal to noise ratio (data not shown). Through optimization as described above, a protocol for medium-scale co-IP of AMPA-R was established and used to isolate native AMPA-R complexes from the membrane fraction (P2) o"

Although many Cited2-mediated phenotypes and molecular events have been well characterized using in vivo genetic murine models, Cited2-directed cell fate decision in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) remains elusive. In this study, we examined the role of Cited2 in the maintenance of stemness and pluripotency of murine ESCs by a gene-targeting approach. Cited2 knock-out (Cited2(Δ/-), KO) ESCs display defective differentiation. Loss of Cited2 in differentiating ESCs results in delayed silencing of the genes involved in the maintenance of pluripotency and self-renewal of stem cells (Oct4, Klf4, Sox2, and c-Myc) and the disturbance in cardiomyocyte, hematopoietic, and neuronal differentiation. In addition, Cited2 KO ESCs experience a delayed induction of cardiomyocyte differentiation-associated proteins, NFAT3 (along with the reduced expression of NFAT3 target genes, Nkx2.5 and β-MHC), N-cadherin, and smooth muscle actin. CITED2 is recruited to the Oct4 promoter to regulate its expression during early ESC differentiation. This is the first demonstration that Cited2 controls ESC pluripotency and differentiation via direct regulation of Oct4 gene expression."

The objective is to improve the clinical performance of mAbs with respect to durable complete responses and cures and to enable mAb therapy in more cancers and cancer patients.

This can be achieved by combining antigen binding specificities for target cells (i.e. tumor cells) and effector cells (i.e. T cells, NK cells, and macrophages) in one molecule (3.Choi B.D. Cai M.

For example, biAbs that recruit and activate T cells through CD3 of the T-cell receptor complex to instruct lysis of CD19-expressing malignant B cells has been an ongoing campaign for two decades (6.Anderson P.M.

Newer biAb formats, such as BiTE (bi-specific T cell engager) (7.Baeuerle P.A. Reinhardt C. Bispecific T-cell engaging antibodies for cancer therapy.Cancer Res. 2009; 69: 4941-4944Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar) and DART (dual affinity retargeting) (8.Moore P.A. Zhang W.

Application of dual affinity retargeting molecules to achieve optimal redirected T-cell killing of B-cell lymphoma.Blood. 2011; 117: 4542-4551Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) overcame these hurdles by reducing both the size and complexity of antibody molecule pairs. Several in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that subnanomolar concentrations of BiTEs and DARTs selectively activate T cells to kill tumor cells (9.Rader C. DARTs take aim at BiTEs.Blood. 2011; 117: 4403-4404Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Furthermore, current phase I and II clinical trials with the (CD19 × CD3) BiTE blinatumomab have revealed impressive clinical activity at doses several orders of magnitude below those administered in conventional mAb therapy (10.Bargou R.

In addition to bypassing MHC/peptide recognition, T cells recruited by BiTEs and DARTs do not require ex vivo prestimulation or in vivo costimulation but, rather, are dependent on the presence of biAb-decorated tumor cells for activation. These favorable features of the BiTE and DART formats are attributed to their small size (∼50 kDa), which brings target and effector cells into close proximity to enable cytolytic synapses, and the monovalent engagement of the TCR complex, which prevents systemic activation of effector cells in the absence of target cells (9.Rader C.

Although employing a variety of formats, recognition of cell surface receptors in conventional mAbs and biAbs is always mediated by Ig scaffolds. In addition to alternative protein scaffolds (12.Löfblom J. Frejd F.Y. Ståhl S. Non-immunoglobulin-based protein scaffolds.Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2011; 22: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar), an increasing number of peptides, peptidomimetics, and other small molecules rival Ig scaffolds with respect to both specificity and affinity. This is due, in part, to improved methods for rational design and the ability to generate and screen large small molecule libraries (13.Kodadek T.

Here we introduce the concept of chemically programmed biAbs that can recruit and activate T cells and are compatible with targeting any cell surface receptor that is recognizable by a small molecule. Exploiting the advantages of small size and monovalence, the invariable biological component of our concept is a ∼50-kDa humanized Fab molecule that binds to CD3 and contains a C-terminal Sec residue through which a variable chemical component can be covalently conjugated. Thus, the resulting conjugates are bispecific as they combine two different specificities in one molecule; one for CD3 mediated by the biological component and one for a cell surface receptor mediated by the chemical component. This work builds on our previously introduced chemical programming strategy that employs a Sec interface for the generation of molecularly defined antibody-small molecule conjugates in various formats (16.Hofer T. Thomas J.D. Burke Jr., T.R. Rader C. An engineered selenocysteine defines a unique class of antibody derivatives.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 12451-12456Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 20.Hofer T. Skeffington L.R. Chapman C.M. Rader C. Molecularly defined antibody conjugation through a selenocysteine interface.Biochemistry. 2009; 48: 12047-12057Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To demonstrate the feasibility and potency of chemically programmed biAbs, we first synthesized derivatives of small molecules (supplemental Fig. S1) known to bind with high specificity and affinity to integrin α4β1 and FOLR1, which are expressed on the tumor cell surface in hematologic and solid malignancies, respectively. Integrin α4β1 (also known as VLA-4) is a noncovalent heterodimer of two type I membrane proteins, ITGA4 (CD49D) and ITGB1 (CD29), that is selectively expressed in hematopoietic cells (21.Imai Y. Shimaoka M. Kurokawa M. Essential roles of VLA-4 in the hematopoietic system.Int. J. Hematol. 2010; 91: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It controls lymphocyte trafficking and homing by binding to vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM1) and fibronectin (FN1). Furthermore, integrin α4β1 is expressed on the surface of malignant B cells, such as in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), where it contributes to cell adhesion-mediated chemotherapy resistance (22.Kurtova A.V. Tamayo A.T. Ford R.J. Burger J.A. Mantle cell lymphoma cells express high levels of CXCR4, CXCR5, and VLA-4 (CD49d). Importance for interactions with the stromal microenvironment and specific targeting.Blood. 2009; 113: 4604-4613Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). LLP2A is a peptidomimetic that was selected previously from a one-bead-one-compound chemical library for binding to integrin α4β1 (23.Peng L. Liu R. Marik J. Wang X. Takada Y. Lam K.S. Combinatorial chemistry identifies high-affinity peptidomimetics against α4β1 integrin for in vivo tumor imaging.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The one-bead-one-compound chemical library from which LLP2A originated was on the basis of mimicking the LDV tripeptide motif of FN1, which is recognized by integrin α4β1 (23.Peng L. Liu R. Marik J. Wang X. Takada Y. Lam K.S. Combinatorial chemistry identifies high-affinity peptidomimetics against α4β1 integrin for in vivo tumor imaging.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Notably, the LDV (i.e. LLP2A) binding site on integrin α4β1 is only accessible when the heterodimer is in its open, functionally active conformation that is provoked by inside-out signaling (21.Imai Y. Shimaoka M. Kurokawa M. Essential roles of VLA-4 in the hematopoietic system.Int. J. Hematol. 2010; 91: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, LLP2A is a probe that detects the open conformation of integrin α4β1 (23.Peng L. Liu R. Marik J. Wang X. Takada Y. Lam K.S. Combinatorial chemistry identifies high-affinity peptidomimetics against α4β1 integrin for in vivo tumor imaging.Nat. Chem. Biol. 2006; 2: 381-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 24.Denardo S.J. Liu R. Albrecht H. Natarajan A. Sutcliffe J.L. Anderson C. Peng L. Ferdani R. Cherry S.R. Lam K.S. 111In-LLP2A-DOTA polyethylene glycol-targeting α4β1 integrin. Comparative pharmacokinetics for imaging and therapy of lymphoid malignancies.J. Nucl. Med. 2009; 50: 625-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). When analyzing normal human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with LLP2A-biotin (25.Thomas J.D. Hofer T. Rader C. Burke Jr., T.R. Application of a trifunctional reactive linker for the construction of antibody-drug hybrid conjugates.Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2008; 18: 5785-5788Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated streptavidin in pilot flow cytometry studies, we did not detect binding to circulating B, T, and NK cells. By contrast, we observed strong binding to primary MCL cells and MCL cell lines. Thus, targeting the open conformation of integrin α4β1 with chemically programmed biAbs provides a compelling strategy for selective intervention of MCL and other hematologic malignancies. FOLR1 (also known as folate receptor α) is an investigational target of mAbs (26.Spannuth W.A. Sood A.K. Coleman R.L. Farletuzumab in epithelial ovarian carcinoma.Expert Opin. Biol. Ther. 2010; 10: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and small molecules (27.Low P.S. Kularatne S.A. Folate-targeted therapeutic and imaging agents for cancer.Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2009; 13: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) in clinical trials for the therapy of lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and other solid malignancies. FOLR1 is a high-affinity cellular entry receptor for folate (also known as vitamin B9), which is essential for DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation, i.e. cell growth, division, and differentiation. Tumor cells express FOLR1 to effectively compete for folate. Folate starvation can induce the cell surface expression of FOLR1 in epithelial tumor cell lines, such as the cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa (28.Antony A. Tang Y.S. Khan R.A. Biju M.P. Xiao X. Li Q.J. Sun X.L. Jayaram H.N. Stabler S.P. Translational up-regulation of folate receptors is mediated by homocysteine via RNA-heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein E1 interactions.J. Clin. Invest. 2004; 113: 285-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Thus, through different culture conditions, FOLR1-positive (FOLR1+) and FOLR1-negative (FOLR1-) HeLa cells can be generated, providing an ideal experimental system for investigating FOLR1 targeting in vitro. See supplemental Experimental Procedures. Human PBMC from healthy volunteers who gave written informed consent were prepared from freshly drawn blood obtained from the Department of Transfusion Medicine, Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health. PBMC were prepared by density gradient centrifugation using lymphocyte separation medium (MP Biomedicals) and used freshly. Human primary MCL cells were derived from a lymph node biopsy of an MCL patient enrolled in a National Institutes of Health clinical protocol with written informed consent and approval from the National Institutes of Health Institutional Review Board. The lymph node was disaggregated to single cells by passage through a wire mesh and resuspension in 10% (v/v) FCS in RPMI 1640 medium followed by cryopreservation in recovery cell culture freezing medium (Invitrogen). Human MCL cell line JeKo-1, human T-cell line Jurkat, and human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa (ATCC) were maintained in 10% (v/v) FCS in regular RPMI 1640 (JeKo-1, Jurkat, FOLR1- HeLa) or folic acid-deficient RPMI 1640 medium (FOLR1+ HeLa) supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin (all from Invitrogen).

The mammalian cell expression vectors encoding v9 IgG-Sec and v9 Fab-Sec were transiently transfected into HEK 293F cells, and supernatants were collected, filtered, and concentrated as described (20.Hofer T.

Subsequently, v9 IgG-Sec was purified by protein G affinity chromatography followed by immobilized metal affinity chromatography, and v9 Fab-Sec was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography as described (20.Hofer T.

The purity of v9 IgG-Sec and v9 Fab-Sec was confirmed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining, and the concentration was determined by absorbance at 280 nm. Established conditions for selective conjugation at the Sec interface were used (16.Hofer T. Thomas J.D. Burke Jr., T.R. Rader C.

DTT at 0.1 mm followed by either LLP2A-biotin-maleimide, (LLP2A)2-biotin-maleimide, folate-biotin-maleimide (supplemental Fig. S1), or biotin-maleimide (maleimide-PEO2-biotin, Pierce) at 40 μm was added to the protein and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. Following conjugation, the proteins were diluted in 15 ml of 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and concentrated to 250 μl as described above. This step was repeated once with 15 ml of 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.2) and subsequently twice with 15 ml of PBS to remove unconjugated compounds. Following sterile filtration, purified conjugates in PBS were stored refrigerated (4 °C) for short-term use and frozen (−80 °C) in aliquots for long-term use. For coating, each well of a 96-well Costar 3690 plate (Corning) was incubated with 100 ng recombinant human integrin α4β1, α4β7, or α9β1 (R&D Systems) in 25 μl of TBS supplemented with 1 mm MnCl2 (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h at 37 °C. After blocking with 150 μl 3% (w/v) BSA/TBS (1 mm MnCl2) for 1 h at 37 °C, 50 ng/well v9 Fab-Sec/LLP2A-biotin, v9 Fab-Sec/(LLP2A)2-biotin, or v9 Fab-Sec in 1% (w/v) BSA/TBS (1 mm MnCl2) were added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. The plate was then washed with H2O and incubated with 50 μl of a 1:1000 dilution of HRP-conjugated goat anti-human kappa light chain pAbs (Southern Biotech) in 1% (w/v) BSA/TBS (1 mm MnCl2) for 1 h at 37 °C. Washing with H2O was repeated and colorimetric detection was performed using 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline)-6-sulfonic acid (Roche) as HRP substrate according to the manufacturer's directions. The absorbance at 405 nm was measured in a SpectraMax M5 microplate reader with SoftMax Pro software (Molecular Devices). For coating, each well of a 96-well Costar 3690 plate was incubated with 100 ng of mouse anti-human interferon-γ mAb 2G1 (Pierce) in 50 μl of PBS for 1 h at 37 °C. After blocking with 150 μl of 4% (w/v) BSA/PBS for 1 h at 37 °C, recombinant human interferon-γ (Pierce) at 0–2500 pg/ml in 4% (w/v) BSA/PBS (50 μl/well) or the supernatants (50 μl/well) from the CD69 assay described below were added and incubated for 2 h at 37 °C. Without washing, 10 ng/50 μl biotin-conjugated mouse anti-human interferon-γ mAb B133.5 (Pierce) in 4% (w/v) BSA/PBS was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS, 50 μl of a 1:1000 dilution of HRP-conjugated streptavidin (Southern Biotech) in 4% (w/v) BSA/PBS was added to each well and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing with 0.2% (v/v) Tween 20 in PBS, colorimetric detection and measurement was carried out as described above. The correlation of absorbance (y) and concentration (x) closely fit (r2 = 0.9973) a linear regression line (y = 0.0038x + 0.0179), which was used to calculate the interferon-γ concentration in the supernatants. Freshly prepared human PBMC from healthy volunteers were first incubated for 15 min on ice in undiluted human AB serum (Invitrogen) to block Fcγ receptors. Blocked human PBMC were diluted to 5 × 105 cells in 10% (v/v) human AB serum in PBS and then incubated with 2 μg/ml v9 Fab-Sec/LLP2A-biotin, 2 μg/ml Fc-Sec/LLP2A-biotin, or an equimolar concentration (40 nm) of LLP2A-biotin (25.Thomas J.D.

PBMC subpopulations were gated by costaining with APC-conjugated mouse anti-human CD4, CD8, CD16, CD19, and CD56 mAbs (all from BD Biosciences) according to the directions of the manufacturer. Propidium iodide (Invitrogen) was added to a final concentration of 5 μg/ml to exclude dead cells from the analysis. Cells were analyzed using a FACSCalibur instrument (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo analytical software (Tree Star). Following trypsinization with 0.25% (w/v) trypsin (Invitrogen), FOLR1+ and FOLR1- HeLa cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 1% (v/v) FCS/PBS, and aliquots of 50 μl containing 5 × 105 cells were distributed into a V-bottom 96-well plate (Corning). The cells were then incubated with 5 μg/ml v9 Fab-Sec/folate-biotin or Fc-Sec/folate-biotin for 45 min on ice. After washing twice with 1% (v/v) FCS/PBS, the cells were incubated with 2 μg/ml of PE-conjugated streptavidin for 45 min on ice. After washing twice as before, the cells were resuspended in 400 μl 1% (v/v) FCS/PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry as described above. FOLR1+ and FOLR1- HeLa cells were used as target cells and distributed into 96-well U-bottom plates (Corning) at a density of 5 × 104 cells/50 μl/well. Freshly prepared human PBMC were used as effector cells and added (50 μl/well) to the target cells at an effector-to-target cell ratio of 20:1. After incubation for 16 h at 37 °C in 5% CO2 with or without v9 Fab-Sec/folate-biotin at 2 μg/ml, the supernatant was used to detect the expression of interferon-γ by a sandwich ELISA as described above.

In parallel, 2 μg/ml v9 Fab-Sec/biotin, Fc-Sec/LLP2A-biotin, and Fc-Sec/(LLP2A)2-biotin were used as negative controls. After resuspending the cells in 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS, cell-cell associations indicated by a CFSE+ PKH26+ double-positive population were detected and quantified by flow cytometry as described above. All incubations were for 1 h at 37 °C. A 96-well Costar 3690 plate was coated with 1 μg of recombinant human integrin α4β1 or recombinant human FOLR1 (R&D Systems) in 25 μl of TBS and blocked with 3% (w/v) BSA/TBS. For integrin α4β1, 1 mm MnCl2 was added to TBS.

Each CYP450 is composed of an apoprotein moiety and a heme prosthetic group, which is required for CYP450 activity. Thus, under conditions of CYP450 induction, there is a coordinate increase in heme biosynthesis to compensate for the increased expression of CYP450s. ABCB6, a mitochondrial ATP binding cassette transporter, which regulates coproporphyrinogen transport from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria to complete heme biosynthesis, represents a previously unrecognized rate-limiting step in heme biosynthesis. However, it is not known if exposure to drugs and environmental contaminants induces ABCB6 expression, to assure an adequate and apparently coordinated supply of heme for the generation of functional cytochrome holoprotein. In the present study, we demonstrate that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the widely distributed environmental toxicants shown to induce porphyrin accumulation causing hepatic porphyria, up-regulate ABCB6 expression in both mice and humans. Using siRNA technology and Abcb6 knock-out mice, we demonstrate that PAH-mediated increase in hepatic porphyrins is compromised in the absence of ABCB6. Moreover, in vivo studies in aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) knock-out mice demonstrate that PAH induction of ABCB6 is mediated by AhR. Promoter activation studies combined with electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrate direct interactions between the AhR binding sites in the ABCB6 promoter and the AhR receptor, implicating drug activation mechanisms for ABCB6 similar to those found in inducible cytochrome P450s.

https://openalex.org/W2021002011,"α-Helical coiled coils, frequent protein oligomerization motifs, are commonly observed in vital proteins. Here, using collagen XVII as an example, we provide evidence for a novel function of coiled coils in the regulation of ectodomain shedding. Transmembrane collagen XVII, an epithelial cell surface receptor, mediates dermal-epidermal adhesion in the skin, and its dysfunction is linked to human skin blistering diseases. The ectodomain of this collagen is constitutively shed from the cell surface by proteinases of a disintegrin and metalloprotease family; however, the mechanisms regulating shedding remain elusive. Here, we used site-specific mutagenesis to target the coiled-coil heptad repeats within the juxtamembranous, extracellular noncollagenous 16th A (NC16A) domain of collagen XVII. This resulted in a substantial increase of ectodomain shedding, which was not mediated by disintegrin and metalloproteases. Instead, conformational changes induced by the mutation(s) unmasked a furin recognition sequence that was used for cleavage. This study shows that apart from their functions in protein oligomerization, coiled coils can also act as regulators of ectodomain shedding depending on the biological context. α-Helical coiled coils, frequent protein oligomerization motifs, are commonly observed in vital proteins.

Role of oligomerization domains in thrombospondins and other extracellular matrix proteins.Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2004; 36: 997-1004Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Coiled coils are found in most, if not all, members of the collagen superfamily (8McAlinden A. Smith T.A. Sandell L.J. Ficheux D. Parry D.A.

In fibrillar collagens, they are usually located in the C-terminal propeptides and function to initiate trimerization and therefore triple-helix folding (8McAlinden A. Smith T.A. Sandell L.J.

Thus far, the major, if not sole, function of coiled coils in collagens has been believed to be trimerization prior to triple helix formation. In this study, using collagen XVII as an example, we provide evidence for a novel function of coiled coils in transmembrane collagens, i.e. in the control of ectodomain shedding. Ectodomain shedding, the release of extracellular domains of transmembrane proteins, is one form of proteolytic maturation of functional proteins. Proteolytic processing of proteins is a common and crucial event in biology, underlined by the fact that more than 2% of mammalian genes encode proteases (10Overall C.M. Blobel C.P. In search of partners. Linking extracellular proteases to substrates.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2007; 8: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Ectodomain shedding is mainly catalyzed by proteinases of the “a disintegrin and metalloprotease” (ADAM) 3The abbreviations used are: ADAMa disintegrin and metalloproteaseM-β-CDmethyl-β-cyclodextrinDHSN-hydroxysuccinimideDecdecanoylCMKchloromethyl ketone. family (11Reiss K.

The full spectrum of biological functions of collagen XVII ectodomain shedding remains uncertain, but binding to laminin-332 and association with migration and differentiation of keratinocytes seem clear (13Franzke C.W.

Collagen XVII as a prototype.Matrix Biol. 2003; 22: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Consistent with this notion, we have shown that migrating keratinocytes constitutively shed and leave the collagenous ectodomain of collagen XVII in the extracellular matrix (22Tasanen K. Tunggal L. Chometon G. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Aumailley M. Keratinocytes from patients lacking collagen XVII display a migratory phenotype.Am. J.

The first cue of functional association of coiled coils and ectodomain shedding in transmembrane collagens comes from the fact that the coiled-coil heptad repeats are located within the juxtamembranous noncollagenous domains adjacent to the cell surface, which also harbor the sheddase recognition and cleavage sites (8McAlinden A. Smith T.A. Sandell L.J. Ficheux D. Parry D.A. Hulmes D.J. α-Helical coiled-coil oligomerization domains are almost ubiquitous in the collagen superfamily.J. Biol.

A recombinant form of the human BP180 ectodomain forms a collagen-like homotrimeric complex.Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8821-8830Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Interestingly, in collagen XVII, the physiological cleavage sites are located 8–11 amino acid residues C-terminally from the coiled coils within the NC16A domain (16Nishie W. Lamer S. Schlosser A. Licarete E. Franzke C.W. Hofmann S.C. Jackow J. Sitaru C. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Ectodomain shedding generates neoepitopes on collagen XVII, the major autoantigen for bullous pemphigoid.J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 4938-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar), indicating the coiled coils are not included in the shed ectodomain. In addition, it has been reported that the recombinant collagenous COL15 domain of collagen XVII can form a trimeric structure without the NC16A domain (25Van den Bergh F. Fu C.L. Olague-Marchan M. Giudice G.J. The NC16A domain of collagen XVII plays a role in triple helix assembly and stability.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 350: 1032-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), suggesting that trimerization of collagen XVII may not always require coiled-coil repeats. These findings led us to investigate the biological functions of coiled coils in the NC16A domain of collagen XVII. We targeted the coiled-coil heptad repeats in the NC16A domain using site-directed mutagenesis and uncovered a novel and essential role of the coiled coils within the NC16A domain in the regulation of collagen XVII ectodomain shedding. The candidate regions for coiled coils on human collagen XVII (NM_000494) were assessed using the COILS (version 2.2) and Paircoil2 (26McDonnell A.V. Jiang T. Keating A.E. Berger B. Paircoil2. Improved prediction of coiled coils from sequence.Bioinformatics. 2006; 22: 356-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar) programs. To determine essential residues for coiled-coil regions, each leucine was changed into a proline as described previously (9Snellman A. Tuomisto A. Koski A. Latvanlehto A. Pihlajaniemi T.

Borradori) was introduced into the NotI site of pcDNA5/FRT (Invitrogen) (16Nishie W. Lamer S. Schlosser A. Licarete E. Franzke C.W. Hofmann S.C. Jackow J. Sitaru C. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Ectodomain shedding generates neoepitopes on collagen XVII, the major autoantigen for bullous pemphigoid.J. Immunol. 2010; 185: 4938-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This construct was designated as COL17. For site-directed mutagenesis of the coiled-coil sequence, two different 1187-bp fragments spanning the EcoRV and ClaI DNA restriction sites, which contain substitution mutations of either Leu495 or both Leu502 and Leu495 into Pro, were chemically produced and cloned into pUC57 (GenScript) (Fig. 1B). EcoRV- and ClaI-digested DNA fragments were then inserted into the COL17-pcDNA5/FRT vector. These constructs were designated as L495P and L495P/L502P. The Flp-In-293 cell line was grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 1 mm sodium pyruvate (all Invitrogen). To establish stably expressing cell lines, pcDNA5/FRT plasmid with wild type and mutant collagen XVII cDNA, as well as the empty vector as a control, were co-transfected with pOG44 into the Flp-In-293 host cells by Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Stably expressing cells were selected under 200 μg/ml hygromycin B (Invitrogen), as described previously (16Nishie W. Lamer S. Schlosser A. Licarete E. Franzke C.W. Hofmann S.C. Jackow J. Sitaru C.

Subconfluent stably transfected Flp-In-293 cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM for 24 h prior to harvesting. Freshly prepared ascorbic acid was added to the culture medium in a final concentration of 50 μg/ml to allow prolyl and lysyl hydroxylation of collagen and proper triple helix formation (15Franzke C.W.

Concentrated cell culture medium and cell lysate were mixed with Laemmli's sample buffer, and the samples, with or without boiling for 5 min, were separated on SDS-PAGE using 4–13% gradient or 7% uniform gels, followed by transfer onto a nitrocellulose membrane. After blocking the membranes with 2% skimmed milk in Tris-buffered saline and incubation with primary antibodies in the same buffer overnight at 4 °C, HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies were reacted for 1 h at room temperature. The signals were visualized by ECL-Plus (GE Healthcare). The following antibodies were employed for immunoblotting: mouse monoclonal antibody NC16A-1 and NC16A-3 directed to distinct epitopes within the NC16A domain of collagen XVII (20Hofmann S.C.

For detection of the intracytoplasmic domain of collagen XVII, the polyclonal goat antibody N18 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was diluted 1:500. A new rabbit polyclonal antibody (Ab-SILP) was produced using the synthetic peptide NH2-SILPYGDS, as described previously (16Nishie W. Lamer S. Schlosser A. Licarete E. Franzke C.W. Hofmann S.C.

Purification of the Ab-SILP was performed using SulfoLink coupling resin (20404, Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer's instructions, and the final concentration of 1 μg/ml of the antibody was used. The β-tubulin antibody Ab6046 (Abcam) in a 1:2,000 dilution was employed as an internal loading control for immunoblotting. Total RNA was extracted from subconfluent transformed Flp-In-293 cells with RNeasy Mini kit (Invitrogen), followed by RT-PCR using SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total cDNA was then amplified with primers F14 (5′-tacaatgagctggctgtgag-3′) and B14 (5′-cggcttgacagcaatacttc-3′) to yield a 374-bp COL17A1 cDNA fragment spanning nucleotides 4117–4491. The primers GAP-F (5′-tcatctctgccccctctgct-3′) and GAP-B (5′-cgacgcctgcttcaccacct-3′) were used for amplification of GAPDH cDNA (NM_002046.3) as a control. Subconfluent cells were washed twice with PBS and then treated with 5–20 mm methyl-β-cyclodextrin (M-β-CD, Sigma) in serum-free DMEM for 60 min (28Zimina E.P. Bruckner-Tuderman L. Franzke C.W.

The medium proteins were concentrated as described above. Precipitated medium proteins were boiled for 5 min with Laemmli's sample buffer, followed by SDS-PAGE. To acetylate all free N termini, a fraction of the medium proteins was treated with 40 mm sulfo-acetate NHS (Thermo Fisher Scientific) before SDS-PAGE, as described (16Nishie W. Lamer S. Schlosser A.

Immunol. 2010; 185: 4938-4947Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). After the SDS-PAGE, the Coomassie Blue-stained 120-kDa band corresponding to the monomer form of the ectodomain was cut out the gel and subjected to mass spectrometry (MS) analysis (Japan Bio Services), as reported previously (16Nishie W. Lamer S. Schlosser A. Licarete E. Franzke C.W. Hofmann S.C. Jackow J. Sitaru C. Bruckner-Tuderman L.

In silico prediction by COILS (29Lupas A. Van Dyke M. Stock J. Predicting coiled from protein sequences.Science. 1991; 252: 1162-1164Crossref PubMed Scopus (3466) Google Scholar) indicated that the stretch Val492–Ile505 in the juxtamembranous NC16A domain of collagen XVII contained two heptad repeats of potential coiled coils (Fig. 1A). The amino acid sequence of this region in collagen XVII is highly conserved among different species (Fig. 1A), suggesting that it has a vital function. When one or both leucines at the d position, Leu495 and/or Leu502, were changed into proline(s), the probability scores predicting a coiled-coil structure calculated by COILS were significantly reduced from 1.0 to 0.4 and 0, respectively (window; amino acids 14, Fig. 1, B and C). Accordingly, the calculated probability value for the prediction of coiled coils in this region by Paircoil2 was significant (p = 0.057) for wild type COL17, whereas those of the mutants L495P and L495P/L502P were both decreased (p = 0.33 and 0.68, respectively). To address the role of coiled coils within the NC16A domain, stably transformed Flp-In-293 cells expressing wild type (COL17) and mutant (L495P/L502P or L495P) collagen XVII were produced. Isogenic expression of genes encoding these constructs was confirmed by RT-PCR (Fig. 2A). For recombinant protein expression, to ensure proper folding of collagen XVII, ascorbic acid was added to the cell culture medium. It is a cofactor for collagen hydroxylases and necessary for proper triple helix formation (15Franzke C.W. Tasanen K."
https://openalex.org/W2002107176,"Regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins are potent inhibitors of heterotrimeric G-protein signaling. RGS4 attenuates G-protein activity in several tissues. Previous work demonstrated that cysteine palmitoylation on residues in the amino-terminal (Cys-2 and Cys-12) and core domains (Cys-95) of RGS4 is important for protein stability, plasma membrane targeting, and GTPase activating function. To date Cys-2 has been the priority target for RGS4 regulation by palmitoylation based on its putative role in stabilizing the RGS4 protein. Here, we investigate differences in the contribution of Cys-2 and Cys-12 to the intracellular localization and function of RGS4. Inhibition of RGS4 palmitoylation with 2-bromopalmitate dramatically reduced its localization to the plasma membrane. Similarly, mutation of the RGS4 amphipathic helix (L23D) prevented membrane localization and its Gq inhibitory function. Together, these data suggest that both RGS4 palmitoylation and the amphipathic helix domain are required for optimal plasma membrane targeting and function of RGS4. Mutation of Cys-12 decreased RGS4 membrane targeting to a similar extent as 2-bromopalmitate, resulting in complete loss of its Gq inhibitory function. Mutation of Cys-2 did not impair plasma membrane targeting but did partially impair its function as a Gq inhibitor. Comparison of the endosomal distribution pattern of wild type and mutant RGS4 proteins with TGN38 indicated that palmitoylation of these two cysteines contributes differentially to the intracellular trafficking of RGS4. These data show for the first time that Cys-2 and Cys-12 play markedly different roles in the regulation of RGS4 membrane localization, intracellular trafficking, and Gq inhibitory function via mechanisms that are unrelated to RGS4 protein stabilization. Regulator of G-protein signaling (RGS) proteins are potent inhibitors of heterotrimeric G-protein signaling. RGS4 attenuates G-protein activity in several tissues. Previous work demonstrated that cysteine palmitoylation on residues in the amino-terminal (Cys-2 and Cys-12) and core domains (Cys-95) of RGS4 is important for protein stability, plasma membrane targeting, and GTPase activating function. To date Cys-2 has been the priority target for RGS4 regulation by palmitoylation based on its putative role in stabilizing the RGS4 protein. Here, we investigate differences in the contribution of Cys-2 and Cys-12 to the intracellular localization and function of RGS4. Inhibition of RGS4 palmitoylation with 2-bromopalmitate dramatically reduced its localization to the plasma membrane. Similarly, mutation of the RGS4 amphipathic helix (L23D) prevented membrane localization and its Gq inhibitory function.

Heterotrimeric G-protein-coupled receptors mediate the responses of a wide array of hormones and neurotransmitters. In many circumstances increased G-protein activity is associated with pathophysiologic processes and disease progression. Thus, understanding the cellular mechanisms whereby G-protein signaling can be attenuated is an important step toward designing therapeutic strategies for the control and prevention of such diseases.

The RGS4 protein is composed of two primary functional domains that are both regulated by palmitoylation. First, the carboxyl terminus contains the ∼120-amino acid GTPase activating protein domain capable of inhibiting both Gi- and Gq-mediated signaling. Palmitoylation of Cys-95 within the GTPase activating protein domain is believed to be important for its function (8.Tu Y. Popov S. Slaughter C. Ross E.M. Palmitoylation of a conserved cysteine in the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) domain modulates the GTPase-activating activity of RGS4 and RGS10.J. Biol.

Second, the ∼50-amino acid amino terminus contains an amphipathic α helix membrane targeting domain that is found adjacent to two palmitoylatable cysteine residues (Cys-2 and Cys-12).

Until recently, however, the relative contributions of Cys-2 and Cys-12 were not independently examined. Some studies suggest that Cys-2 is the primary site of palmitoylation in RGS4 and that palmitoylation of this residue enhances RGS4 function by preventing oxidation/arginylation and subsequent degradation via the N-end rule ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal pathway (11.Davydov I.V.

Recently Tu and co-workers (13.Wang J. Xie Y. Wolff D.W. Abel P.W. Tu Y. DHHC protein-dependent palmitoylation protects regulator of G-protein signaling 4 from proteasome degradation.FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 4570-4574Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) showed that palmitoylation of Cys-2 by the palmitoyl acyltransferases DHHC3 (and DHHC7) can increase the half-life of RGS4 and thereby show better G-protein inhibitory potential. In contrast to the large amount of information known about Cys-2 palmitoylation and its contribution to RGS4 stabilization, very little information is available concerning the relative roles of Cys-2 and Cys-12 as determinants of RGS4 localization and intracellular trafficking. Here, we here investigate the extent to which Cys-12 palmitoylation, regardless of the palmitoylation status of Cys-2, may be an important regulator of RGS4 intracellular localization and function. Our data show for the first time that Cys-12 is more important than Cys-2 as a determinant of RGS4 plasma membrane targeting and Gq inhibitory function, and we propose that this is due to its proximity to the amphipathic α helix plasma membrane targeting domain. Although Cys-2 is largely dispensable for plasma membrane targeting, it does appear to play a role in the trafficking of RGS4 through different intracellular membrane compartments, and thus its palmitoylation status may be important for regulating its normal trafficking and recycling within the cell. The pEYFP-C1 plasmid (BD Biosciences Clontech, Mississauga, ON) and pQE Trisystem1 (Qiagen, Mississauga, ON) expression vectors were used for expression of all RGS protein constructs. HA-tagged Gq(R183C) was generously provided by P. Waedegartner (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA). Fluorescently tagged versions of the trans-Golgi network marker protein TGN38 were kind gifts from J. Lippincott-Schwartz (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). The monoclonal anti-His tag antibody was from Clontech (#631212), anti-HA antibody was from Roche Applied Science, Mississauga, ON, (#11666606001), and the anti-mouse secondary antibody was from GE Healthcare (#NXA931). All tissue culture media and transfection reagents were from Invitrogen and Roche Applied Science respectively. HEK293 cells (tsA-201 derivative) were a kind gift from Z-P. Feng (University of Toronto, Toronto, ON). Unless otherwise stated all other reagents and chemicals were from Sigma. HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Ham's F-12 medium (1:1), supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 10 μg/ml streptomycin, 100 units/ml penicillin) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. For subcellular localization studies RGS4-YFP expression plasmids were generated in the pEYFP-C1 vector by cloning the human RGS4 cDNA into the NheI/AgeI sites to generate a carboxyl-terminal YFP fusion. Robust expression was ensured by inclusion of an optimized translation initiation signal in the context of the first methionine codon (GCCACCATGGCG). For functional studies RGS4-His expression constructs were generated in the pQE Trisystem1 vector by cloning RGS4 coding sequences into the NcoI/BamHI polylinker sites. Cysteine point mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis, and primer sequences are available as supplemental data. All plasmid constructs were purified using the Endofree Maxi kit (Qiagen) and verified by sequencing of the complete protein-coding region. The expression of the pQE Trisystem clones were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-His-tag antibody and ECL detection. HEK293 cells (2.0 × 106 in 6-well plates) were transfected in triplicate using of FuGENE 6TM transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's specifications. DNA amounts used in transfection were determined empirically to ensure similar expression levels of all RGS4 constructs tested. Specifically we used 0.5 μg of Gq(R183C), 3 μg of RGS4WT-His, 0.5 μg of RGS4C2A-His, 3 μg of RGS4C12A-His, 0.5 μg of RGS4C2AC12A-His, 1 μg of RGS4L23D-His, and an appropriate amount of empty HisStrep vector to ensure 4.0 μg of total plasmid DNA/well. After 24 h cells were trypsinized, pooled, and replated in 6-well plates for analysis of inositol phosphate production (n = 3 wells/construct) and corresponding protein expression determination by Western blotting. Inositol phosphate production was measured 48 h after transfection as described previously (14.Heximer S.P. RGS2-mediated regulation of Gαq.Methods Enzymol. 2004; 390: 65-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 h after plating, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and labeled in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (without inositol) containing 10 mm LiCl and 1.4 μCi/ml myo-[3H]inositol (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for exactly 15 h. Then cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and the inositol phosphate production was stopped with 750 μl of ice-cold 20 mm formic acid. The entire contents of the wells were collected and spun at 13,000 × g for 15 min in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C. The supernatant fraction (700 μl) was neutralized with 214 μl of 0.7 m NH4OH before proceeding to the ion exchange chromatography steps. For each well to be measured, a 3-ml Dowex resin (AG 1-X8, 200–400-mesh, formate form) column was prepared. The entire sample was added to the column, and the unbound 3H-labeled inositol-containing fraction was collected for determination of total 3H-inositol loading, while the inositol phosphate-containing fraction was eluted into collection tubes using 5 ml of 1.2 m ammonium formate. 0.5 ml of each sample from total inositol-containing and inositol phosphate-containing fractions was added to 10 ml of scintillation fluid and counted. Inositol phosphate levels were expressed as the fraction of the total soluble 3H-labeled inositol material (inositol phosphate total/inositol-containing fraction) for each sample. For most experiments HEK293 cells were plated at 50% in tissue culture-treated microscopy dishes (Ibidi, #81156) and transfected with 1 μg of each construct to be tested using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent as describe above. For localization of RGS4 during phosphoinositol hydrolysis experiments, constructs were transfected in the identical ratios that were used for functional analysis (outlined above). After a 20-h incubation, dishes were sent for confocal microscopy to determine their plasma membrane/cytosol localization ratio containing transfected cells. Confocal microscopy was performed on ∼70% confluence live cells at 37 °C using an Olympus FluoView 1000 laser-scanning confocal microscope. Images represent a single equatorial plane on the basal side of the cell obtained with a 60× oil objective, 1.4 numerical aperture. Confocal images were processed with Microsoft Office 2010. Quantification of plasma and endo-membrane localization was performed in a blinded manner, with membrane/cytosol ratios measured using the Image J software package and Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) for each endosome was calculated by the Fluo-View software. For movie data, the cells were visualized on a WaveFX Spinning-Disk confocal microscope (Quorum Technologies, Guelph, Canada), which comprises an Olympus IX81 microscope stand, a Yokogawa CSU10 spinning-disk unit, and a Hamamatsu C9100–13 EM-CCD camera, all controlled with Volocity software. Imaging was performed using a 60×/1.42NA oil immersion objective lens, 488-nm solid-state laser illumination, and an EGFP bandpass filter. 10 × 10-cm plates of HEK293 cells stably transfected with either wild type or the C2A/C12A mutant of RGS4 were plated to ∼70% confluence. To increase final RGS4 protein yield, each plate was transiently transfected with the same RGS4 clone that was used to make the stable lines (RGS4WT (6 μg) or C2AC12A (2 mg) in 6 μl of X-tremegene HP, Roche Applied Science). The RGS4 expression constructs contained a carboxyl-terminal streptavidin-binding peptide tag. 12 h post-transfection medium was changed to 1:1 DMEM:F-12 with 5% charcoal-treated fatty acid-free serum. After 24 h cells were serum-starved for 1 h in DMEM:F-12 and then incubated for 8 h in palmitic acid labeling medium (DMEM containing 10% charcoal-treated serum, 0.4% of 25 mm alkyl-17-ODYA palmitate analog). Cells were collected and lysed at 4 °C using lysis buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton-X, pH 7.4, and protease Complete MiniTM protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science). Samples were briefly sonicated, and lysates were incubated with streptavidin-Sepharose High Performance beads (GE Healthcare) overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed 5 times with lysis buffer and once with acidic lysis buffer, pH 4.0. For click chemistry reaction, beads were mixed with lysis buffer containing 1 mm CuSO4, 1 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine, 100 μm tris(benzyltriazolylmethyl)amine, and 20 μm Alexa-488 azide (Invitrogen) at room temperature for 1.5 h. After the click-mediated addition of Alexa-488 to palmitoylated proteins, the beads were washed 3 times with lysis buffer, and RGS4 eluted in SDS-PAGE loading buffer before running on 12% gels. Gels were fixed in 40% methanol, 10% acetic acid for in-gel fluorescent detection of in Alexa-488 on the Typhoon imaging station. The relative amount of RGS4 protein in the eluates was examined by Western blotting for the HA epitope tag. Proteins were transferred to (Trans-Blot, Bio-Rad) nitrocellulose membrane. Membranes were blocked for 1 h in 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% bovine serum albumin. Primary antibodies were added to 5% BSA at concentrations provided by the vendor's instructions and incubated with membranes overnight at 4 °C before removing by washing. Horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary mouse or rabbit antibody in 5%BSA was added for 2 h before washing and signal detection using Super Signal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific). One-way ANOVA with a Tukey's post hoc test was used to determine statistical significance between the groups. Where correlation coefficients were compared Fisher's r to z′ transformation was employed. *, p < 0.05. The amino-terminal domain of RGS4 was previously shown to be important for its plasma membrane targeting in yeast cells (9.Bernstein L.S. Grillo A.A. Loranger S.S. Linder M.E. RGS4 binds to membranes through an amphipathic α-helix.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18520-18526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 10.Srinivasa S.P. Bernstein L.S. Blumer K.J. Linder M.E. Plasma membrane localization is required for RGS4 function in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 5584-5589Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). This domain contains an amphipathic α helical domain and two palmitoylatable cysteine residues (Cys-2 and Cys-12) as potential plasma membrane targeting motifs. In a heterologous yeast system, the amphipathic helix domain of RGS4 was shown to be necessary and sufficient for plasma membrane targeting and G-protein inhibition. These data suggested a diminutive role for amino-terminal palmitoylation in regulating RGS4 function in lower eukaryotes. In a more autologous human cell line, however, the determinants that control human RGS4 plasma membrane targeting, function, and intracellular trafficking have not been carefully examined. In particular, very little is known about the intracellular trafficking of RGS4 between plasma membrane and endosomal or cytosolic pools. Wild type RGS4-YFP strongly localized to the plasma membrane as well at bright endosome-like structures (∼40% of HEK293 cells examined) in laser-scanning confocal microscopy experiments (Fig. 1A). Spinning-disc confocal analysis of the wild type clone also revealed a high level of RGS4-containing endosome activity including the slower-moving structures described above and numerous less fluorescent rapidly moving endosomes that were not readily discernible by the laser-scanning technique (supplemental Movie 1). Mutation of Leu-23 within the amphipathic helix domain (L23D) resulted in complete redistribution of RGS4 from the plasma membrane to the cytosol and an apparent loss of RGS4 localization to the endosomal compartment. Spinning-disc confocal microscopy of L23D confirmed loss of RGS4 within both the bright slow moving and rapidly moving endosome pools. (supplemental Movie 2). Compared with controls, expression of Gq(R183C) markedly increased the production of inositol phosphates in HEK293 cells. Co-expression of wild type RGS4 with Gq(R183C) resulted in an ∼80% reduction in inositol phosphate production. Consistent with the notion that proper plasma membrane targeting is required for its function, the mislocalized L23D mutant was unable to inhibit Gq(R183C)-mediated inositol phosphate production compared with wild type RGS4 (Fig. 1B). Thus, the L23D mutant could be used as a nonfunctional RGS transfection control for other mutants to be analyzed. We focused first on whether palmitoylation of the amino terminus was an important determinant of its plasma membrane localization and function in mammalian cells. Indeed, inhibition of endogenous palmitoyl-CoA transferases with 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) resulted in marked redistribution of RGS4 from the plasma membrane to the cytosol (Fig. 2A). To determine the potential contribution of Cys-2 and Cys-12 palmitoylation to the membrane localization of RGS4, we studied the localization of individual (C2A or C12A) and combined (C2A/C12A) alanine mutations. Supporting the notion that palmitoylation of the amino terminus is a key determinant of human RGS4 localization in human cells, the combined mutation of Cys-2 and Cys-12 dramatically decreased plasma membrane:cytosol localization ratio (Fig. 2, B and C). Indeed, the extent of mislocalization of the combined mutant approached that of the L23D clone. Evidence that a loss of palmitoylation may explain the mislocalization of the mutant RGS4 protein came from palmitate-labeling studies, where introduction of the C2A/C12A mutant all but abolished incorporation of the palmitic acid analog 17-octadecynoic acid (Fig. 2D). Also of interest was the observation that, like L23D, the C2A/C12A mutant show dramatically reduced endosomal localization when it was examined by spinning disk microscopy (supplemental Movie 3). Surprisingly, mutation of Cys-12 alone (C12A), but not Cys-2 (C2A), was sufficient to disrupt the plasma membrane targeting of RGS4. Notably, the effect of the cysteine mutations on the plasma membrane:cytosol ratio was similar in both the absence (Fig. 2) and the presence (Fig. 3) of coexpressed GqR183C. It did appear, however, that active Gq modestly increased the plasma membrane:cytosol ratio of all the wild type and cysteine mutants, presumably via its ability to recruit some RGS4 from the cytosolic pool.FIGURE 3Localization of RGS4 wild type and mutant constructs is relatively unaffected by Gq(R183C). A, localization of different YFP-tagged cysteine mutants of RGS4 fusion constructs in HEK293 cells in the presence of co-expressed Gq(R183C) was examined by confocal microscopy as described above. Scale bars represent 1 μm. B, the ratio of the RGS4-YFP signal between the cytosol and plasma membrane was analyzed as above (n > 30). One-way ANOVA with a Tukey's post hoc test was used to determine differences between groups. S.E. are indicated by arrow bars (*, p < 0.05).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Functional studies for the RGS4 cysteine mutant series mostly paralleled the plasma membrane localization data. Specifically, compared with the wild type protein, the mislocalized C12A and C2A/C12A proteins showed virtually no Gq inhibitory function, whereas the C2A protein retained some Gq inhibitory function (Fig. 4). In an attempt to explain the differential importance of Cys-2 and Cys-12 with respect to RGS4 localization and function, we used a helical net projection to map the positions of Cys-2 and Cys-12 relative to the stretch of amino acids in RGS4 containing its amphipathic helix domain (amino acid residues 12–30) (Fig. 5). Based on the relative proximity of Cys-12 to this helix domain and its position immediately adjacent to the putative membrane-binding surface, it seems likely that palmitoylation of Cys-12 would have a greater impact on the length of the hydrophobic interface of the helix than would palmitoylation of Cys-2. Previous work on the RGS2 protein showed that the length of the aliphatic interface had a profound effect on its plasma membrane localization and Gq inhibitory function (15.Gu S. He J. Ho W.T. Ramineni S. Thal D.M. Natesh R. Tesmer J.J. Hepler J.R. Heximer S.P.

Linder M.E. Blumer K.J. Gi/o signaling and the palmitoyltransferase DHHC2 regulate palmitate cycling and shuttling of RGS7 family binding protein.J. Biol. Chem. 2011; 286: 13695-13703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), we next examined the extent to which palmitoylation on Cys-2 or Cys-12 affects the intracellular trafficking of RGS4. The spinning-disk confocal data discussed above provided preliminary evidence that mutation of Cys-2 and Cys-12 may alter endosomal localization of RGS4. We next used laser scanning confocal to more carefully quantify this effect. RGS4-YFP was observed in discreet intracellular compartments in ∼ 40% of the cells examined (Fig. 6). The addition of 2-BP dramatically reduced targeting of RGS4 to the endosome compartment (data not shown). Notably, Cys-2 and Cys-12 seem to contribute differentially to the distribution of RGS4 within the intracellular pool. Mutation of Cys-12 reduced the percentage of cells showing endosomes to ∼15%, whereas mutation of Cys-2 nearly completely disrupted RGS4 localization to endosomal structures (Fig. 6). G-protein α subunits cycle between the plasma membrane and the Golgi compartment. Palmitoylation at the level of the Golgi is a key step in this process (16.Tsutsumi R. Fukata Y. Noritake J. Iwanaga T. Perez F. Fukata M. Identification of G protein α subunit-palmitoylating enzyme.Mol. Cell. Biol. 2009; 29: 435-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We wondered whether the Cys-2 and Cys-12 palmitoylation sites on RGS4 may likewise be a component of its cycling between the plasma membrane and Golgi. Indeed RGS4 was reported to be associated with both the plasma membrane and Golgi compartments (19.Sullivan B.M. Harrison-Lavoie K.J. Marshansky V. Lin H.Y. Kehrl J.H. Ausiello D.A. Brown D.

https://openalex.org/W2053740009,"Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM)-like transcript-1 (TLT-1) is an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM)-baring TREM family protein. In this study, we identified an alternative transcript form of TLT-1, namely TLT-1s, which has very short extracellular immunoglobulin domain consisting of only 202 amino acids. TLT-1s was mainly expressed in macrophages and osteoclast precursor cells. Upon receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand stimulation, TLT-1s mRNA and protein levels were gradually decreased in BMMs. We also showed the TLT-1s is localized to the cytoplasmic membrane in osteoclast precursor cells. TLT-1s silencing strongly enhanced the formation and resorption activity of osteoclast. In addition, forced expression of TLT-1s showed reduced formation of osteoclast. Because ITIM-baring proteins inhibit immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-mediated receptor signaling, we tested whether TLT-1s physically interacted with TREM-2, the ITAM-associated co-stimulatory receptor essential for osteoclast differentiation. We showed that TLT-1s is associated with TREM-2 in osteoclast precursor cells. TLT-1s is also associated with tyrosine Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 and SH2 domain-containing inositol phosphatase-1 and recruited them to the TREM2-ITAM signaling complex. In addition, knockdown of TLT-1s markedly elevated the intracellular calcium concentration and oscillation in osteoclast precursor cells. In addition, calcium-mediated induction of nuclear factor of activated T cells was also increased by TLT-1s silencing. Furthermore, TREM-2-mediated Akt activation and proliferation of osteoclast precursor cells were also enhanced in TLT-1s silenced cells. In this paper, we found the noble ITIM-baring inhibitory membrane protein; TLT-1s, which regulates ITAM-mediated signaling on osteoclastogenesis. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM)-like transcript-1 (TLT-1) is an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM)-baring TREM family protein. In this study, we identified an alternative transcript form of TLT-1, namely TLT-1s, which has very short extracellular immunoglobulin domain consisting of only 202 amino acids. TLT-1s was mainly expressed in macrophages and osteoclast precursor cells. Upon receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand stimulation, TLT-1s mRNA and protein levels were gradually decreased in BMMs. We also showed the TLT-1s is localized to the cytoplasmic membrane in osteoclast precursor cells. TLT-1s silencing strongly enhanced the formation and resorption activity of osteoclast. In addition, forced expression of TLT-1s showed reduced formation of osteoclast. Because ITIM-baring proteins inhibit immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-mediated receptor signaling, we tested whether TLT-1s physically interacted with TREM-2, the ITAM-associated co-stimulatory receptor essential for osteoclast differentiation. We showed that TLT-1s is associated with TREM-2 in osteoclast precursor cells. TLT-1s is also associated with tyrosine Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase-1 and SH2 domain-containing inositol phosphatase-1 and recruited them to the TREM2-ITAM signaling complex. In addition, knockdown of TLT-1s markedly elevated the intracellular calcium concentration and oscillation in osteoclast precursor cells. In addition, calcium-mediated induction of nuclear factor of activated T cells was also increased by TLT-1s silencing. Furthermore, TREM-2-mediated Akt activation and proliferation of osteoclast precursor cells were also enhanced in TLT-1s silenced cells. In this paper, we found the noble ITIM-baring inhibitory membrane protein; TLT-1s, which regulates ITAM-mediated signaling on osteoclastogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2013033805,"Whole brain weighted connectivity networks were extracted from high resolution diffusion MRI data of 14 healthy volunteers. A statistically robust technique was proposed for the removal of questionable connections. Unlike most previous studies our methods are completely adapted for networks with arbitrary weights. Conventional statistics of these weighted networks were computed and found to be comparable to existing reports. After a robust fitting procedure using multiple parametric distributions it was found that the weighted node degree of our networks is best described by the normal distribution, in contrast to previous reports which have proposed heavy tailed distributions. We show that post-processing of the connectivity weights, such as thresholding, can influence the weighted degree asymptotics. The clustering coefficients were found to be distributed either as gamma or power-law distribution, depending on the formula used. We proposed a new hierarchical graph clustering approach, which revealed that the brain network is divided into a regular base-2 hierarchical tree. Connections within and across this hierarchy were found to be uncommonly ordered. The combined weight of our results supports a hierarchically ordered view of the brain, whose connections have heavy tails, but whose weighted node degrees are comparable."
https://openalex.org/W2077218993,"The transient receptor potential channels TRPML2 and TRPML3 (MCOLN2 and MCOLN3) are nonselective cation channels. They are widely expressed in mammals. However, little is known about their physiological function(s) and activation mechanism(s). TRPML3 can be activated or rather de-inhibited by exposing it first to sodium-free extracellular solution and subsequently to high extracellular sodium. TRPML3 can also be activated by a variety of small chemical compounds identified in a high throughput screen and is inhibited by low pH. Furthermore, it was found that TRPML3 is constitutively active in low or no sodium-containing extracellular solution. This constitutive activity is independent of the intracellular presence of sodium, and whole-cell current densities are similar with pipette solutions containing cesium, potassium, or sodium. Here, we present mutagenesis data generated based on the hypothesis that negatively charged amino acids in the extracellular loops of TRPML3 may interfere with the observed sodium inhibition. We systematically mutated negatively charged amino acids in the first and second extracellular loops and found that mutating Glu-361 in the second loop has a significant impact on the sodium-mediated block of TRPML3. We further demonstrate that the TRPML3-related cation channel TRPML2 is also activated by lowering the extracellular sodium concentration as well as by a subset of small chemical compounds that were previously identified as activators of TRPML3, thus confirming the functional activity of TRPML2 at the plasma membrane and suggesting similar gating mechanisms for both TRPML channels."

Increasing evidence supports that the interplay between the structural and functional properties of actin filaments is finely regulated by actin-binding proteins; however, the underlying mechanisms and biological consequences are not completely understood.

During the process of invasion E. histolytica ingests red blood and host cells using phagocytic processes. Though phagocytosis is considered to be a key virulence determinant, the mechanism is not very well understood in E. histolytica. We have recently demonstrated that a novel C2 domain-containing protein kinase, EhC2PK is involved in the initiation of erythrophagocytosis. Because cells overexpressing the kinase-dead mutant of EhC2PK displayed a reduction in erythrophagocytosis, it appears that kinase activity is necessary for initiation. Biochemical analysis showed that EhC2PK is an unusual Mn2+-dependent serine kinase. It has a trans-autophosphorylated site at Ser428 as revealed by mass spectrometric and biochemical analysis. The autophosphorylation defective mutants (S428A, KDΔC) showed a reduction in auto and substrate phosphorylation.

A reduction and delay in erythrophagocytosis was observed in E. histolytica cells overexpressing S428A and KDΔC proteins.

Entamoeba histolytica is the etiologic agent of amoebiasis, a major form of intestinal infection found throughout the world, more so in developing countries. Estimates show that more than 50 million people are infected with the parasite, resulting in 50,000 deaths every year that can be attributed to this disease (1Haque R. Huston C.D. Hughes M. Houpt E.

Therefore, detailed molecular characterization of both the endocytic pathways (phagocytosis and fluid phase pinocytosis) may be of use in identifying novel targets for development of new therapeutics.

To understand detailed mechanism of initiation of phagocytosis in E. histolytica we have characterized the kinase domain of EhC2PK. In this report, we show that the EhC2PK is a Mn2+-dependent serine kinase. It displays one trans-autophosphorylation reaction at Ser428 residue, which is likely to play a crucial role in phagocytosis. Our results indicate a unique function of EhC2PK in amoebic phagocytosis, not exhibited by any protein kinases that are known to be involved in phagocytosis/endocytosis. This is also the first protein kinase of E. histolytica that has been characterized at molecular level. The antibody generation was carried out at Abexome Biosciences Pvt. Ltd., Bangalore, India. The polyclonal antibody was raised in rabbit against the sequence, PTASMNEL where serine was phosphorylated. Phosphoserine peptide was used as immunogen and the non-phosphorylated peptide was used for negative screening. The IgG fraction was enriched by affinity purification with the protein A column. Immunofluorescence staining was carried out as described before (5Sahoo N. Labruyère E. Bhattacharya S. Sen P. Guillén N. Bhattacharya A.

Briefly E. histolytica cells, resuspended in TYI-33 medium, were transferred onto acetone-cleaned coverslips placed in a Petri dish and allowed to adhere for 10 min at 35.5 °C. The culture medium was removed, and the cells were fixed with 3.7% pre-warmed paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 30 min. After fixation, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% TritonX-100/PBS for 1 min. This step was omitted for non-permeabilized cells. The fixed cells were then washed with PBS and quenched for 30 min in PBS containing 50 mm NH4Cl. The coverslips were blocked with 1% BSA/PBS for 30 min, followed by incubation with primary antibody at 37 °C for 1 h. The coverslips were washed with PBS followed by 1% BSA/PBS before incubation with secondary antibody for 30 min at 37 °C. Antibody dilutions used were: Anti-EhC2PK at 1:200, anti-rabbit Alexa 488 (Molecular Probes) at 1:300 and TRITC-Phalliodin at 1:300.

The edges of the coverslips were sealed with nail-paint to avoid drying. Confocal images were visualized using an Olympus Fluoview FV1000 laser scanning microscope. To quantify the RBC ingested by amoebae, the colorimetric method of estimation with some modifications was followed as described by Sahoo et al. Briefly, 107 RBC, washed with PBS and TYI-33, were incubated with 50,000 amoebae for varying times at 37 °C in 1 ml of culture medium. The amoebae and erythrocytes were pelleted down, non-engulfed RBC were lysed with cold distilled water and recentrifuged at 1000 × g for 2 min. This step was repeated twice, followed by resuspension in 1 ml of formic acid to lyse amoebae containing engulfed RBC. Samples were measured against a formic acid blank with a spectrophotometer at 397 nm. The fluorescent ATP nucleotide analog, (2′, 3′-O-(2,4,6 trinitrophenyl)-adenosine triphosphate (TNP-ATP), was purchased from Molecular Probes. ATP was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Fluorescence measurements were performed on a Cary Win Luminescence Spectrometer. All purified proteins were taken at concentrations of 1.5 μm and mixed with 0–3.5 mm ATP and 1 mm MnCl2 in 10 mm HEPES and 100 mm NaCl buffer in a reaction volume of 0.7 ml. Fluorescence emission was recorded at 334 nm. Fluorescence titrations with TNP-ATP were monitored at an excitation wavelength of 403 nm (λexc = 403 nm) and an emission wavelength from 500–580 nm (λem = 547 nm). All purified proteins were taken at concentration of 1.5 μm and mixed with 10 μm TNP-ATP and 1 mm MnCl2 in 10 mm HEPES and 100 mm NaCl buffer in a reaction volume of 0.7 ml at pH 7.5. ATP was added to the similar reaction by keeping the volume constant. The temperature of the sample was maintained at 25 ± 0.1 °C by circulating thermostatically controlled water through the cuvette holder. Autophosphorylation was measured as the incorporation of radioactivity from [γ-32P]ATP into a species that co-migrated with authentic purified recombinant protein. The standard reaction mixture (40 μl final volume) contained 2 mm MnCl2, 30 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), and pure kinase domain (2 μg). Reactions were initiated by the addition of [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol) to a final concentration of 2.5 μm and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. In experiments for determining Michelis-Menten parameters the ATP was varied by 10-fold from 10 pm to 250 μm in the above stated reaction. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS sample buffer containing 50 mm EDTA followed by boiling. The samples were than resolved on SDS-PAGE gel. The Coomassie-stained bands from gels were then excised and counts were taken. While determining the time course kinetics for autophosphorylation, the whole kinase reaction was stopped by adding 20% TCA. The precipitate was washed two times with 20% TCA, two times with cold acetone, and finally with 70% ethanol. The dried pellets were than dissolved in water and spotted on GFC filters dried and counts were taken. About 1 μg of radiolabeled phosphorylated kinase domain were incubated with 10 unit of calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) from NEB at 37 °C for 2 h. Dephosphorylated proteins were analyzed by SDS/PAGE, followed by Western blot with phosphospecific antibody. The purified SDS-PAGE protein band was subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion. Briefly, the excised gel was sliced to small pieces, transferred to sterile siliconized Eppendorf and destained by repeated washing with 50 mm NH4HCO3 and 50% acetonitrile. For the reduction, 75 μl of 10 mm stock dithiothreitol (DTT) was added and incubated 55 °C for 30 min on hot water bath. The reduction solution was removed and 50 μl of 50 mm iodoacetamide (IAM) stock solution was added and the mixture was incubated at room temperature, in the dark, for 40 min. Enzymatic digestion was carried out by incubating the reaction mixture with trypsin (40 ng/μl of 25 mm NH4HCO3 and incubation was carried out overnight at 37 °C. The extracted peptide mixture was analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS and LC-ESI-ETD MS/MS (tandem mass spectrometry). MALDI-TOF-MS analysis was carried out with Ultraflex TOF/TOF (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) mass spectrometer, equipped with 50 Hz pulsed nitrogen laser (λ = 337 nm), operated in positive ion reflectron mode using a 150-ns pulsed ion extraction time delay, and a 20 kV accelerating voltage. The trypsin-digested samples were mixed with equal volume of saturated matrix solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) in 50% acetonitrile/H2O with 0.1% trifluroacetic acid. This mixture (1.5 μl) was deposited on the MTP 384 ground steel plate, and the spectral data were processed by Bruker Daltonics FLEX analysis, software version 3.0. A standard peptide mixture (P.N: 206195, Bruker peptide calibration standard) was used for external calibration. On-line HPLC separation of tryptic digests of recombinant phosphorylation protein was carried out on HP1100 (Agilent) at a flow rate of 200 μl/min. The solvent system consisting solution A; 0.1% formic acid in water and solution B; acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid was used. Tryptic peptides were separated on a C8 reverse-phase column (2.1 × 100 mm, 3.5 μm particle size; zorbax 300SB-C8, P.No:861775–906, Agilent) using a linear gradient of solution B 5–95% achieved in 55 min. The electrospray ionization (ESI) ETD MS/MS data were obtained on a HCT Ultra PTM Discovery system with ETD II (Bruker Daltonics, Germany), equipped with two octapole and followed by a three-dimensional ion trap, nCI source for ETD ion generation. Fluoranthene was used to generate an ion mass of 202 m/z and methane is used as carrier gas to carry an ion to ion trap. Experimental scan range used is from 100–2800 m/z in positive ion mode, ETD ms/ms spectrum is used by using auto ms(n) in Bruker esquire control software and data are analyzed in Bruker data analysis software. Acquired ETD-MS/MS spectra were interpreted manually. Statistical comparisons were made using a one-way ANOVA test. Experimental values were reported as the means ± S.E. Differences in mean values were considered significant at p < 0.05. All calculations of statistical significance were made using the GraphPad InStat software package (GraphPad). Bioinformatic analysis clearly showed that EhC2PK contains a functional protein kinase domain as all residues known to be conserved in protein kinases were present (11Hanks S.K. Hunter T. Protein kinases. The eukaryotic protein kinase superfamily: kinase (catalytic) domain structure and classification.Faseb J. 1995; 9: 576-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (2281) Google Scholar). The kinase domain of EhC2PK shares 46% sequence identity with Ca2+/Cam-dependent kinases (Fig. 1) and shows the presence of glycine triad, which acts as a flexible clamp that covers and anchors nontransferable ATP. The conserved Lys residue of subdomain II (which interacts with α and β phosphoryl groups of ATP and helps to anchor and orient ATP for catalysis) is at position 179. The conserved glutamine at position 196 helps in stabilization of interaction between Lys179 and ATP. Two conserved residues Asp273 and Asn278 lie within the highly conserved motif found in Ser/Thr kinases (His-Arg-Asp-Leu-Lys-X-X-Asn, HRDLKXXN) forming the catalytic loop. The triplets DFG (Asp293-Phe294-Gly295) and APE (Ala318-Pro319-Glu320), which helps to orient γ-phosphate for transfer, and are reported to play a role in substrate recognition, respectively, are also conserved in EhC2PK. The C-terminal conserved motifs are not found in EhC2PK. The presence of all the essential motifs showed that the kinase domain should be able to function as an active kinase. Therefore, subsequent experiments were carried out with only the kinase domain (residues 150 to 446, 30 kDa) unless otherwise indicated. The kinase domain of EhC2PK was investigated to determine the number of ATP binding sites and the residues that are involved in ATP binding. This was needed to generate a kinase-dead mutant by mutagenesis. We have used fluorescence spectroscopy along with TNP-ATP, an analog of ATP for these studies. The two conserved key residues Lys179 and Asp273 needed for kinase activity (see previous section) were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis to alanine and used in further studies. ATP binding reduced tryptophan fluorescence of the protein as reported before (Fig. 2A). With increasing amounts of ATP, the fluorescence decreased by 43, 40, and 13% for the wild type kinase domain, D273A mutant, and K179A mutant, respectively. ATP binding was also monitored by using TNP-ATP. Free TNP-ATP is weakly fluorescent in buffer alone but significantly high upon binding to proteins; the absolute magnitude is dependent on the specific protein environment (12Yao H. Hersh L.B. Characterization of the binding of the fluorescent ATP analogue TNP-ATP to insulysin.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 451: 175-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). For the wild-type kinase domain and the D273A mutant, there was a 2-fold increase in fluorescence of TNP-ATP on protein binding (Fig. 2, B and C). This increase was not seen in the presence of 500-fold excess ATP. The K179A mutant behaved differently, as there was no significant increase in fluorescence of TNP-ATP in the presence of the mutant protein (Fig. 2D). These results suggest that the Lys179 residue is involved in ATP binding. This was further confirmed by UV cross-linking of [γ-32P]ATP with the purified protein. The wild type, K179A, and D273A were incubated with [γ-32P]ATP and irradiated with UV (254 nm) in order to cross-link the proteins with radiolabeled ATP. While cross-linking of [γ-32P]ATP with the wild type and D273A mutant was observed (radioactive band in autoradiogram) low level of cross-linking was visible in the case of K179A, suggesting that K179A mutant is impaired in ATP binding (supplemental Fig. S1). The affinity of ATP binding to K179A mutant was found to be much lower than that of the wild-type protein. The kinase activity was tested using histone type III and myelin basic protein (MBP) as substrates. Phosphorylation of external substrate was observed with the wild-type full-length protein (EhC2PK-GST) (Fig. 3A) and the kinase domain (KD) but not with the kinase-dead mutants (K179A and D273A) (supplemental Fig. S2, A and B). The full-length protein (EhC2PK-GST) was enzymatically active in the presence of Mn2+ and phosphatidylserine (PS) (Fig. 3A), and there was no effect of diacylglycerol (DAG) and Ca2+ on EhC2PK activity unlike conventional PKCs. This is likely to be due to the absence of the C1 domain in this protein. On the other hand, the kinase domain alone showed phosphorylation activity in vitro independent of PS. The kinetics of autophosphorylation showed that it reached saturation at about 1 h. Therefore, all kinase reactions were carried out for 1 h. Both full-length protein and the kinase domain showed autophosphorylation along with substrate phosphorylation (see marked bands in supplemental Fig. S2, A and B and Fig. 3A). We also checked for divalent cation requirement in the phosphorylation reaction (supplemental Fig. S3, A and B). The autophosphorylation as well as substrate phosphorylation activities of the kinase domain were maximum in the presence of 1 mm Mn2+ (supplemental Fig. S4). Thus EhC2PK is one among a handful of kinases that require the presence of Mn2+ instead of Mg2+. In this respect EhC2PK is similar to tyrosine kinases. The biological significance of this unique divalent cation requirement is not clear. The time kinetics of autophosphorylation, both for full-length protein and kinase domain were similar as both showed two distinct phases, initial slow followed by a sharp increase in the rate of phosphorylation leading to a plateau (Fig. 3B). The kinase activity was significantly inhibited by staurosporine (Fig. 3C), a serine/threonine kinase inhibitor (13Rüegg U.T. Burgess G.M. Staurosporine, K-252 and UCN-01: potent but nonspecific inhibitors of protein kinases.Trends Pharmacol Sci. 1989; 10: 218-220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). About 50% inhibition of autophosphorylation was observed at 150 nm of staurosporine. There was no significant inhibition of autophosphorylation by genistein (Fig. 3D) at nontoxic concentrations (14Akiyama T. Ishida J. Nakagawa S. Ogawara H. Watanabe S. Itoh N. Shibuya M. Fukami Y. Genistein, a specific inhibitor of tyrosine-specific protein kinases.J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 5592-5595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggesting that EhC2PK may be a serine-threonine kinase. The Km and Vmax for ATP were estimated to be 1.4 ± 0.43 μm and 66 nmol/min/mg ATP, respectively (Fig. 3E). The value for Km for EhC2PK is lower than that usually observed for Ser/Thr protein kinases (10–150 μm) (15Wang Y. Roach P.J. Rickwood D. Hames B.D. Purification and Assay of Mammalian Protein (Serine/Threonine) Kinases: Protein Phosphorylation. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 121-144Google Scholar). The site(s) of autophosphorylation was determined by mass spectrometric analysis. In this case, the purified kinase domain was incubated with ATP in phosphorylation buffer without external substrate. The quality of the purified protein was checked by mass spectrometric analysis and the size of the intact molecule was determined to be 39.93 kDa, comparable to the expected size of the protein (supplemental Fig. S5). Mass spectrometric analysis of the trypsin digest of the autophosphorylated product revealed only one phosphorylated peptide. Sequencing of the peptide fragment identified Ser428 as the major phosphorylated amino acid suggesting that this residue may be the site of autophosphorylation (Fig. 4A). A detailed study of spectra also revealed the presence of the same peptide in a non-phosphorylated form, with mass, 80 daltons less than the phosphorylated one (supplemental Fig. S6). The experiment was rigorously repeated, but our attempts did not yield any other phosphorylated residue other than Ser428. However, it is not possible to rule out other minor phosphorylation site(s) because the total coverage of the protein with the identified peptides was 56%. To confirm mass spectrometry data and to assess the importance of the phosphorylation site, a point (S428A) and a deletion mutant lacking 40 amino acid residues (KDΔC) including Ser428 were generated. Mass spectrometric analysis confirmed the identity of the mutant protein (supplemental Fig. S7). The purified mutant proteins were tested for autophosphorylation, and the results are shown in Fig. 4B. Both mutant proteins exhibited a reduction in autophosphorylation activity by about 90% as compared with the wild-type protein. Interestingly the substrate phosphorylation activity was also reduced, the level of reduction for KDΔC and S428A were 75 and 50%, respectively (supplemental Fig. S8). A putative phosphomimetic mutant S428E was also generated and characterized. Time-dependent substrate phosphorylation of S428A displayed only the slow linear initial rate of substrate phosphorylation but not the later phase of increased rate of reaction unlike the wild-type protein. The phosphomimetic mutant S428E exhibited a linear incorporation with no initial slow phase. These results suggest that autophosphorylation at Ser428 is an important regulator of EhC2PK activity (Fig. 4C). Autophosphorylation of the kinase domain can be either through a unimolecular cis-reaction or a bimolecular trans-reaction. To check this, phosphorylation reactions were carried out with GST-tagged kinase-dead mutant K179A (acceptor) and autophosphorylation dead mutants KDΔC and S428A (donor) (Fig. 4D). When the His-tagged wild type (WT) kinase domain was incubated with the GST-tagged kinase-dead mutant (GST-K179A), the latter got phosphorylated. Both KDΔC and S428A mutants were capable of phosphorylating K179A, but at reduced levels compared with the wild-type protein (Fig. 4D). Trans-phosphorylation was further demonstrated by using varying amounts of donor (S428A) and acceptor (K179A) mutants. On increasing the acceptor molecules in relation to a constant level of donor molecules, the autophosphorylation of the acceptor increased (Fig. 4E). Small amounts of autophosphorylation, observed in the donor molecules, was significantly reduced as the concentration of acceptor molecules was increased. These results suggest that EhC2PK autophosphorylates using a bimolecular trans-reaction and that phosphorylation of Ser428 is required for optimum kinase activity of EhC2PK. The role of autophosphorylation in RBC phagocytosis was studied by overexpressing KDΔC and S428A mutants in amoebic cells using a tetracycline-inducible system (16Sahoo N. Bhattacharya S. Bhattacharya A. Blocking the expression of a calcium-binding protein of the protozoan parasite E. histolytica by tetracycline regulatable antisense-RNA.Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2003; 126: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5A). The overexpression of the proteins in the presence of increasing concentration of tetracycline was confirmed by immunoblot analysis (Fig. 5, B and C). Generally phagocytic cups are initiated within 3 min of incubation with RBCs in E. histolytica cells. However, the process was delayed in cells overexpressing autophosphorylation-defective mutants because no phagocytic cups were observed after 3 min of incubation despite RBCs attached to the trophozoites (Fig. 5D). There was also a significant decline (35%) in the level of phagocytosis when one of the mutants was overexpressed in the presence of tetracycline as compared with the cells without tetracycline or the cells with vector alone in the presence of tetracycline (Fig. 5E). The reduction was even greater in cells expressing antisense RNA of EhC2PK (68%). This may be due to autophosphorylation of endogenous EhC2PK by mutant proteins. Proliferating cells of E. histolytica undergo continuous endocytosis (2Orozco E. Guarneros G. Martinez-Palomo A. Sánchez T. Entamoeba histolytica phagocytosis as a virulence factor.J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 1511-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar); therefore it is likely that the phosphorylated form of EhC2PK will exist in the cells. A phosphospecific antibody was raised specifically against a peptide containing phosphorylated Ser428. The specificity of the antibody was determined by probing purified recombinant protein, phosphorylated protein, S428A, and dephosphorylated protein simultaneously with the antibody (supplemental Fig. S9). The antibody recognized only the phosphorylated form of the protein and did not bind to the unphosphorylated form of the protein as indicated by the Western blotting. The results showed that proliferating E. histolytica cells contain the phosphorylated form of EhC2PK (Fig. 5F). Protein kinases are a highly diverse group of proteins that are involved in the regulation of major cellular processes including signal transduction. Kinase diversity is a result of different combinations of domains and sequence alterations in the kinase domain (17Newton A.C. Regulation of protein kinase C.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 161-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar). EhC2PK is a novel protein kinase containing a C2 domain and a kinase domain similar to Ca2+-Cam-dependent kinases. Our data also show that EhC2PK requires Mn2+ for optimal kinase activity in vitro, a property displayed by only a few known protein kinases, such as dual specificity kinase AtSTYPK from A. thaliana which shows strong preference for Mn2+ than Mg2+ (18Reddy M.M. Rajasekharan R. Role of threonine residues in the regulation of manganese-dependent Arabidopsis serine/threonine/tyrosine protein kinase activity.Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2006; 455: 99-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), kinase domain of EGFR (19Wedegaertner P.B. Gill G.N. Activation of the purified protein-tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor.J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11346-11353Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a phosphorylase kinase in which Mg2+ causes phosphorylation at seryl residues while Mn2+ causes phosphorylation at tyrosine residues (20Yuan C.J. Huang C.Y. Graves D.J. Phosphorylase kinase, a metal ion-dependent dual specificity kinase.J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17683-17686Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The biological relevance of such enzymes is not clear, and more work is needed to understand if there is any Mn2+-dependent signaling system in this parasite. Interestingly, sequence features do not indicate anything unusual about this kinase, and it appears to have most of the features of other Ser/Thr kinases. We further show using a dominant negative approach that autophosphorylation at Ser428 residue plays a regulatory role in EhC2PK activity. The autophosphorylation in EhC2PK takes place at Ser428 of C-terminal part as compared with threonine residues in conventional CaM kinase I and PKCs (21Nolen B.S. Taylor S. Ghosh G.

Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 22Olsen J.V. Blagoev B. Gnad F. Macek B. Kumar C. Mortensen P. Mann M. Global, in vivo, and site-specific phosphorylation dynamics in signaling networks.Cell. 2006; 127: 635-648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2807) Google Scholar). Ser428 is not a part of any conserved pseudo substrate motif and belongs to that part of the protein which does not show any structure. Our attempt to model this region was not successful because of this property of disorderliness. It is likely that lack of structure may make this region more accessible for autophosphorylation. Our results strongly suggest a regulatory role of this region in kinase activity of EhC2PK. It is clear from our previous studies that EhC2PK is involved in the initiation of erythrophagocytosis in E. histolytica (6Somlata Bhattacharya S. Bhattacharya A. A C2 domain protein kinase initiates phagocytosis in the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica.Nat. Commun. 2011; DOI:10.1038/ncomms1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The requirement of a functional kinase domain was evident when it was observed that overexpression of the kinase-dead mutant and the C2 domain alone led to impaired phagocytosis. In this study, we have further extended our initial observations and show that autophosphorylation at Ser428 of EhC2PK is critical for initiation of phagocytosis. The evidence in support of this comes from both in vitro and in vivo experiments conducted to identify Ser428 as a major site of autophosphorylation and using mutant proteins that lack this site. Importantly, it was observed that the autophosphorylation event regulates kinase activity of EhC2PK, suggesting that the kinase activity is controlled through an autocatalytic event. This is evident from the kinetics of the phosphorylation reaction where we observed an initial slow phase followed by a rapid phase. This indicates that kinase activity is low in the absence of or at low level of autocatalysis resulting in a time lag before the enzyme becomes highly active. Many protein kinases require phosphorylation for full activity, and this modification can be a critical event in the activation of these enzymes (21Nolen B.S. Taylor S. Ghosh G. Regulation of protein kinases; controlling activity through activation segment conformation.Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 661-675Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar, 23Hook S.S. Means A.R. Ca2+/ CaM-dependent kinases: From activation to regulation.Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2001; 41: 471-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation could be catalyzed by a second enzyme or it could be consequence of an autophosphorylation reaction (24Lochhead P.A. Sibbet G. Morrice N. Cleghon V.

Activation segment exchange: A common mechanism of kinase autophosphorylation?.Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 351-356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). For EhC2PK, the data suggest that phosphorylation at Ser428 is the result of a trans-autophosphorylation reaction. This trans-phosphorylation may be significant in relation to phagocytosis as there is an enrichment of EhC2PK upon RBC attachment. Higher density of the enzyme is likely to promote more trans-autophosphorylation events leading to activation of EhC2PK above a threshold so that it may initiate formation of phagocytic cups. The low Km (1.4 ± 0.4 μm) for ATP suggests that EhC2PK can work optimally at low ATP concentrations once the enzyme is activated. This is physiologically relevant as the parasite may encounter unfavorable nutrient conditions where an enzyme working at low ATP concentrations will help the parasite to endocytose nutrients and aid in its survival. Lack of Ca2+ dependence of the kinase activity of EhC2PK activity is consistent with our observation of the precise functions of Ca2+ in phagocytosis. Based on the data presented here and previous publications, it appears that Ca2+ is needed for membrane attachment of EhC2PK and signal transduction through EhCaBP1, which is recruited by EhC2PK to the phagocytic cup in a Ca2+-independent manner. In conclusion phagocytosis of RBCs in E. histolytica has been exploited in this study as a system to understand the endocytic process in molecular detail. Our studies have led to the identification of a critical residue Ser428 of a novel kinase EhC2PK as a key regulator of the initiation of phagocytosis through a concentration-dependent autocatalytic mechanism. Such a novel mechanism has not been reported in any other system. Our work suggests that parasitic protists can be good model systems to understand the diversity of basic biological processes because of the increasing availability of essential molecular tools.

Upon cell adhesion, protein-protein interactions among molecules at focal adhesions (FAs) play major roles in the regulation of cell morphogenesis and migration. Although tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin is critically involved in adhesion-mediated signaling, the significance of paxillin phosphorylation at Ser-85 and the mechanism by which it regulates cell migration remain unclear. In this study, we examined how Ser-85 phosphorylation of paxillin affects FA formation and cell migration. We found that paxillin phosphorylation at Ser-85 occurred during HeLa cell adhesion to collagen I and was concomitant with tyrosine phosphorylation of both focal adhesion kinase and talin. However, the non-phosphorylatable S85A mutant of paxillin impaired cell spreading, FA turnover, and migration toward collagen I but not toward serum. Furthermore, whereas the (presumably indirect) interaction between paxillin and the C-terminal tail of talin led to dynamic FAs at the cell boundary, S85A paxillin did not bind talin and caused stabilized FAs in the central region of cells. Together, these observations suggest that cell adhesion-dependent Ser-85 phosphorylation of paxillin is important for its interaction with talin and regulation of dynamic FAs and cell migration.

Integrin proteomes reveal a new guide for cell motility.Sci. Signal. 2009; 2: pe58Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Among known FA molecules, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and c-Src (or the FAK·c-Src complex) are involved in modulating diverse signaling pathways after cell adhesion (2Mitra S.K. Schlaepfer D.D. Integrin-regulated FAK-Src signaling in normal and cancer cells.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2006; 18: 516-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (1188) Google Scholar). FAK is autophosphorylated at Tyr-397 upon cell engagement to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Phosphorylated Tyr-397 recruits SH2 (Src homology 2) domain-containing molecules such as c-Src, which phosphorylates other Tyr residues in FAK (3Schaller M.D. Cellular functions of FAK kinases: insight into molecular mechanisms and novel functions.J. Cell Sci. 2010; 123: 1007-1013Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). Another FA molecule, paxillin, has also been shown to be phosphorylated in vitro by FAK and is known to be involved in protein-protein interactions upon cell adhesion (4Lock J.G. Wehrle-Haller B. Stromblad S. Cell-matrix adhesion complexes: master control machinery of cell migration.Semin. Cancer Biol. 2008; 18: 65-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Such cell adhesion-dependent protein interactions involving paxillin can lead to the dynamic regulation of downstream signaling activities for different cellular functions such as actin reorganization and morphological changes that are involved in both cell migration and invasion (5Carragher N.O.

Integrins on the cell surface interact with the ECM at FAs, where cells sense rigidity and dimensionality from the underlying ECM (6Destaing O. Block M.R. Planus E. Albiges-Rizo C.

Specialized focal contacts or adhesions such as invadopodia or invasive protrusions also dynamically sense the ECM, and their formation is regulated by cell adhesion signaling activity during invasion (7Linder S.

The function of paxillin as an adhesion-dependent adaptor molecule can be attributed to its phosphorylation state. Phosphorylation of paxillin at Tyr-31 and Tyr-118 occurs in a FAK- and c-Src-dependent manner (9Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T. pp125FAK-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin creates a high-affinity binding site for Crk.Mol.

These phosphorylation events allow recruitment of SH2 domain-containing molecules such as CrkII (a homologue of CT10 Regulator of Kinase) which leads to Rac1 signaling via the CrkII-Dock-ELMO complex (10Grimsley C.M.

Paxillin comes of age.J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Paxillin also has many Ser/Thr phosphorylation sites that are targeted by diverse kinases, including MAPKs (12Deakin N.O. Turner C.E. Paxillin comes of age.J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Among them, JNK-mediated Ser-178 phosphorylation of paxillin plays a role in the migration of bladder tumor epithelial cells (13Huang C. Rajfur Z. Borchers C. Schaller M.D. Jacobson K. JNK phosphorylates paxillin and regulates cell migration.Nature. 2003; 424: 219-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar), and p38MAPK-mediated Ser-85 phosphorylation of paxillin regulates NGF-induced neurite outgrowth of PC-12 cells (14Huang C.

Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Interestingly, post-translational modification of paxillin Ser-85 in rat insulinoma cells can occur via either O-GlcNAcylation or phosphorylation; Ser-85 O-GlcNAcylation of paxillin mediated by hyperglycemic conditions is counteracted by cell adhesion-dependent phosphorylation (15Kwak T.K.

O-GlcNAcylation of Ser-85 limits cellular protrusions, whereas phosphorylation or blocking of this O-GlcNAcylation enhances cellular protrusions (15Kwak T.K. Kim H. Jung O. Lee S.A. Kang M. Kim H.J.

Because paxillin phosphorylation at Ser-85 is important for cell morphology, it is possible that Ser-85 can regulate metastatic potential, including cell migration and invasion capacity, although the mechanisms by which Ser-85 phosphorylation of paxillin affects such cellular functions are not clear. In this study, we investigated how Ser-85 phosphorylation of paxillin is involved in both migration and invasion. We found that the phosphorylation of Ser-85 upon cell adhesion is required for the association of paxillin with the C-terminal tail domain of talin, which in turn plays an important role in the regulation of FA dynamics required for efficient migration and invasion. HeLa cervical cancer cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in DMEM-H (WelGENE, Inc., Daegu, Korea) supplemented with 10% FBS (Invitrogen) and gentamycin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). Subconfluent cells were harvested or transiently transfected with HA3-tagged WT, S85A, or S85D paxillin with or without GFP-talin, the GFP-tagged N-terminal talin head domain (amino acids (aa) 1–433), or the GFP-tagged C-terminal talin tail domain (aa 434–2541) for 36 h. In some cases, cells were microporated with control siRNA (sc-37007, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or siRNA against paxillin (sc-29439) using the Neon® transfection system, and 1 day later, the cells were transfected with HA3-tagged WT or S85A mutant paxillin using FuGENE® HD (Promega) for 24 h prior to replating and harvesting. The transfected cells were trypsinized, washed twice with PBS, and pelleted. Pellets were resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium containing 1% BSA and rolled over (60 rpm) at 37 °C for 1 h to eliminate basal signaling activity. Resuspended cells were kept in suspension or replated onto dishes or coverslips precoated with fibronectin, collagen I, or laminin I (10 μg/ml; Trevigen, Gaithersburg, MD) in the absence or presence of 10% FBS. After incubation for the indicated times, cells were processed for whole cell lysate preparation, indirect immunofluorescence, or actin staining. Whole cell lysates were prepared using radioimmunoassay buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors). To some samples, the pharmacological p38MAPK inhibitor SB202190 (10 μm; LC Laboratories, Woburn, MA) was directly added in serum-free replating medium 30 min before replating. The lysates were quantitated using the BCA method (Thermo Scientific Pierce), normalized, and used in standard Western blotting with antibodies against phospho-Ser-83 paxillin for rat paxillin (Ser-85 paxillin for human paxillin) (16Ishibe S.

Constructs for the head or tail domain of human talin tagged with GFP were kind gifts from Dr. Juliano Rudy (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC). Other phosphomimetic mutants of HA3-S85D or HA3-S85E paxillin were engineered using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and their sequences were confirmed. Fragments of the tail domain of talin tagged with GST were engineered by PCR using primers with linker oligonucleotides containing sequences for the EcoRI restriction site at the 5′-end and the NotI restriction site at the 3′-end to generate four fragments from the talin tail domain (aa 433–2541). The C-terminal tail domain 1 (D1) fragment (aa 434–1060), the C-terminal tail D2 fragment (aa 952–1372), the C-terminal tail D3 fragment (aa 1373–1948), or the C-terminal tail D4 fragment (aa 1949–2541) was subcloned into pGEX4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences), and their sequences were confirmed. mCherry-conjugated human WT and S85A paxillin constructs were engineered, and their sequences were confirmed by direct sequence analyses. Whole cell lysates containing at least 500 μg of protein were mixed with anti-HA antibody-precoated beads (30 μl of 50% slurry/condition; Sigma) or anti-GFP antibody (0.5 μg/condition; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and rotated overnight at 4 °C. Protein A/G-Sepharose beads (30 μl of 50% slurry; Upstate, Billerica, MA) were added to the mixture and rotated for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were collected, washed, and eluted prior to standard Western blotting using anti-talin, anti-FAK, anti-HA, anti-vinculin, or anti-GFP antibody. Recombinant GST fusion proteins were prepared as described previously (15Kwak T.K. Kim H. Jung O. Lee S.A. Kang M. Kim H.J. Park J.M. Kim S.H. Lee J.W. Glucosamine treatment-mediated O-GlcNAc modification of paxillin depends on adhesion state of rat insulinoma INS-1 cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 36021-36031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Purified recombinant GST fusion proteins on glutathione-agarose beads (Cell Signaling Technology) were mixed with HeLa cell extracts (300 μg of proteins) by rotation (60 rpm) for 1 h at 4 °C and washed twice with ice-chilled lysis buffer and twice with PBS. Beads with attached proteins were mixed with 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer and boiled for 5 min prior to immunoblotting using anti-GST, anti-talin, anti-FAK, or anti-paxillin antibody. Cells were transiently transfected with the various constructs described above, control or paxillin siRNA alone, or paxillin siRNA and S85A paxillin for 36 h. The cells were replated on coverslips precoated with collagen I in the absence of serum for 15 or 30 min prior to staining for actin using phalloidin (Invitrogen) and subsequent immunostaining using anti-HA, anti-phospho-Tyr-397 FAK, anti-paxillin, or anti-vinculin antibody overnight at 4 °C. Cells were also immunostained with anti-GFP-talin (green) and anti-HA3-paxillin (red) antibodies and the appropriate secondary antibodies. Cells were washed three times with PBS and once with pure H2O and mounted with a mounting solution (DakoCytomation). Visualization was performed using a BX51TR fluorescent microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan). Cells were transiently transfected with mock constructs, HA3-WT paxillin, or HA3-S85A paxillin for 36 h and analyzed for migration using Transwell chambers with 8-μm pores (Corning, Costar, NY) as described previously (17Lee S.A. Kim T.Y. Kwak T.K. Kim H. Kim S. Lee H.J. Kim S.H. Park K.H. Kim H.J. Cho M. Lee J.W. Transmembrane 4 L six family member 5 (TM4SF5) enhances migration and invasion of hepatocytes for effective metastasis.J. Cell Biochem. 2010; 111: 59-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The assay measured migration toward 10% FBS or collagen I (10 μg/ml) for 6 or 12 h. In some cases, SB202190 (10 μm) was added to cells just before loading into the upper chambers. Migration toward BSA was used as a negative control. The migrated cells on the filter were randomly imaged (at least five images/condition), and the numbers of migrated cells were counted independently by two investigators to obtain means ± S.D. for graphs. Cells transiently transfected with mock, HA3-WT paxillin, or HA3-S85A paxillin constructs for 36 h were harvested as described above and immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody prior to silver staining (Bio-Rad). Cells transfected with HA3 (mock) or HA3-paxillin (WT or S85A) were analyzed for invasive protrusions by culturing the cells on Oregon Green® 488-conjugated gelatin (Invitrogen) and detecting the black spots produced due to the degradation of gelatin. The number of cells with degraded ECM among at least 100 cells was counted for each condition, and the percentage of the total area that showed ECM degradation was calculated by ImageJ analysis to give the mean ± S.D. for graphic presentation. Student's t test was performed for comparison of means to determine whether the differences were significant. p values <0.05 were considered significant. We previously reported that Ser-85 phosphorylation of paxillin upon cell adhesion could enhance membrane protrusions in insulinoma cells under hyperglycemic conditions and that this effect was antagonized by O-GlcNAcylation (i.e. post-translational modification of Ser/Thr residues with O-GlcNAc) (15Kwak T.K. Kim H. Jung O. Lee S.A. Kang M. Kim H.J. Park J.M. Kim S.H. Lee J.W. Glucosamine treatment-mediated O-GlcNAc modification of paxillin depends on adhesion state of rat insulinoma INS-1 cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 36021-36031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this study, we used HeLa cervical cancer cells to reveal how paxillin Ser-85 phosphorylation is important for cellular functions such as FA dynamics and cell migration/invasion. We either kept HeLa cells in suspension or newly replated them onto collagen I-precoated culture dishes for different times. Through immunoblot analysis of diverse cell adhesion-related molecules, we found that cell adhesion caused not only tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin but also Ser-85 phosphorylation of paxillin and Ser-425 phosphorylation of talin (Fig. 1A). Thus, the phosphorylation of paxillin Ser-85 also depended on the cell adhesion process. To further confirm this dependence on cell/ECM adhesion, we transfected cells with either WT or S85A mutant paxillin for 36 h and maintained cells in suspension or replated cells onto dishes precoated with different ECM components for 30 min. On fibronectin, collagen I, and laminin, adhesion signaling activities involving FAK and paxillin tyrosine phosphorylation were obvious when cells were transfected with WT paxillin but were reduced in cells transfected with S85A mutant paxillin (Fig. 1B). Moreover, transfection with WT paxillin did not result in the obvious formation of phospho-Ser-85 paxillin when the transfected cells were kept in suspension or replated on fibronectin or laminin. Furthermore, suppression of paxillin decreased phospho-Ser-85 paxillin, phospho-Tyr-397 FAK, phospho-Tyr-577 FAK, and phospho-Ser-425 talin in cells transiently transfected with WT or S85A paxillin (Fig. 1C). Therefore, it appears that the formation of phospho-Ser-85 paxillin may be linked to specific adhesion signaling contexts such as adhesion of HeLa cells onto collagen I. We next examined the significance of phospho-Ser-85 paxillin in actin remodeling and FA formation. By actin staining 15 or 30 min after replating on collagen I, we found that WT paxillin caused extensive spreading of cells with well developed actin stress fibers (94.7 ± 3.5 or 96.3 ± 3.8%, respectively), whereas the S85A mutant caused limited spreading with less significant actin remodeling (25.4 ± 6.8 or 12.5 ± 4.3%, respectively) (Fig. 1D). As for FA formation via immunostaining Tyr-397-phosphorylated FAK, cells expressing WT paxillin showed well developed FAs along cell boundaries and protrusions (91.7 ± 5.9%), whereas cells expressing the S85A mutant had limited FA formation (17.2 ± 4.7%) (Fig. 1E). These observations indicate that phospho-Ser-85 paxillin depends on cell adhesion and plays roles in FA formation and actin remodeling during cell adhesion. Given that paxillin Ser-85 can be modified by O-phosphorylation or O-GlcNAcylation (15Kwak T.K. Kim H. Jung O. Lee S.A. Kang M. Kim H.J. Park J.M. Kim S.H. Lee J.W. Glucosamine treatment-mediated O-GlcNAc modification of paxillin depends on adhesion state of rat insulinoma INS-1 cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 36021-36031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), we mutated Ser-85 to either Asp (S85D) or Glu (S85E) to clarify how the S85A mutant-mediated effects occurred. Standard Western blotting using lysates from suspended or adherent cells transfected with WT, S85A, or S85D paxillin vector revealed that WT or S85D paxillin expression caused sufficient activation of cell adhesion-related signaling molecules, including FAK, paxillin, and talin, whereas the S85A mutant did not (Fig. 2A). Furthermore, when actin was stained in cells expressing WT, S85D, or S85E paxillin, efficient protrusive processes were observed, whereas cells expressing S85A paxillin formed less efficient protrusive processes (Fig. 2B, upper panels). Meanwhile, when the localization of exogenous paxillin was examined, WT, S85D, or S85E paxillin localized efficiently at FAs along the cell boundaries, but the S85A mutant did not (Fig. 2B, middle panels). Therefore, these observations indicate that Ser-85-phosphorylated paxillin affects cell adhesion and actin organization via localization at FAs along cell boundaries (Fig. 2B). We next investigated whether phospho-Ser-85 paxillin is involved in cell migration because it appears to be important for FA formation and actin remodeling (Fig. 1). A Transwell migration assay was performed using cells transfected with WT or S85A paxillin. Cells showed similar migration capacity toward 10% FBS in the lower chamber regardless of WT or mutant paxillin transfection (Fig. 3A, upper panels, and B, left panel). However, haptotactic migration toward collagen I depended on paxillin type: cells expressing WT paxillin showed efficient migration, whereas cells expressing the S85A mutant showed greatly reduced migration (Fig. 3A, lower panels, and B, right panel), indicating that phospho-Ser-85 paxillin is important for haptotaxis but not for serum-mediated chemotaxis. Consistent with the lack of difference in chemotactic migration, adhesion signaling activities of cells adhered to collagen I in the presence of 10% FBS showed no difference between WT or S85A paxillin cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin and Ser-425 phosphorylation of talin were not attenuated by the mutation, whereas Ser-85 phosphorylation of paxillin was blocked by the S85A mutation, as expected (Fig. 3C). Meanwhile, replating in the absence of serum resulted in lower signaling activity in S85A mutant cells compared with WT cells (Fig. 1B), which might be correlated with the reduced migration toward collagen I. It was previously reported that Ser-85 phosphorylation of paxillin in PC-12 cells is mediated by p38MAPK (14Huang C. Borchers C.H. Schaller M.D. Jacobson K. Phosphorylation of paxillin by p38MAPK is involved in the neurite extension of PC-12 cells.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). We therefore examined whether Ser-85 phosphorylation-mediated migration depends on p38MAPK activity by Transwell migration analysis using cells transfected with WT or S85A paxillin in the absence or presence of the p38MAPK inhibitor SB202190. SB202190 treatment decreased the WT paxillin-mediated migration toward collagen I to a similar level to that in S85A mutant cells (Fig. 3, D and E). As expected, SB202190 treatment also reduced phospho-Ser-85 paxillin but not phospho-Tyr-118 paxillin (Fig. 3F). Interestingly, although phospho-Tyr-118 paxillin was not inhibited (Fig. 3F, first and third lanes), WT paxillin-mediated signaling activities of phospho-Tyr-397 FAK and phospho-ERK1/2 were inhibited by SB202190 treatment (Fig. 3F). This observation suggests that phospho-Ser-85 paxillin might be involved in certain signaling activities during cell migration, presumably through protein-protein interactions among FA molecules. In addition to haptotactic migration, invasive protrusion formation was enhanced by WT paxillin but was abolished by S85A paxillin (Fig. 4, A and B). These observations indicate that phospho-Ser-85 paxillin is involved in cell migration and invasion, especially when the surrounding ECM is critically involved. We examined how phospho-Ser-85 paxillin is involved in cell adhesion during migration and invasion. We hypothesized that paxillin might be involved in the formation of an efficient FA complex, whereas S85A paxillin might not perform this function. Therefore, we examined differential protein interactions of WT and S85A paxillin via silver staining of their immunoprecipitates. Exogenously transfected WT paxillin co-immunoprecipitated diverse proteins compared with S85A paxillin or the mock control (Fig. 5A), indicating that there might be differential protein complexes presumably depending on its Ser-85 phosphorylation. We thus examined the existence of FA molecules in in vitro pulldown experiments using recombinant GST-paxillin (WT or S85A) and HeLa extracts. Among FA molecules, we found that a small amount of talin was present in the GST-WT paxillin pulldown but not in the GST-S85A paxillin pulldown (Fig. 5B and supplemental Fig. S1). Interestingly, both GST-tagged WT and S85A paxillin bound FAK (supplemental Fig. S1A), indicating that the specificity of paxillin binding may depend on Ser-85 phosphorylation. Moreover, immunoprecipitation of HA3-paxillin showed co-immunoprecipitation of talin from adherent cells transfected with WT paxillin but not from adherent cells transfected with S85A paxillin or from suspended cells (Fig. 5C), indicating that paxillin but not the S85A mutant associates with talin upon adhesion. However, FAK was constitutively found in the HA3-paxillin immunoprecipitates whether paxillin was mutated or not (Fig. 5C and supplemental S1A). We next cotransfected cells with HA3-paxillin (WT or S85A) together with either the head or tail domain of talin and performed immunoblot analysis of FAK and paxillin phosphorylation. Although tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin was generally inhibited by cotransfection of S85A paxillin and the C-terminal tail domain of talin, tyrosine phosphorylation was not altered by the paxillin mutant when it was cotransfected with the N-terminal head domain of talin (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, phospho-Ser-85 paxillin was obvious in adherent cells that were cotransfected with WT paxillin and the C-terminal tail of talin, whereas it was insignificant in cells transfected with either S85A paxillin or the head domain of talin or in suspended cells (Fig. 5D). In the reverse co-immunoprecipitation experiment, GFP-talin immunoprecipitates showed a slight co-immunoprecipitation of HA3-paxillin only in cells that were cotransfected with GFP-talin and WT paxillin but not the S85A mutant adhered on collagen I (Fig. 5E). Furthermore, immunoprecipitates of HA3-WT paxillin but not HA3-S85A paxillin co-immunoprecipitated the C-terminal tail domain of talin conjugated with GFP but not the head domain (Fig. 5F). These data suggest that Ser-85 phosphorylation of paxillin upon cell adhesion is important for its association with talin, especially with the C-terminal tail domain. Furthermore, a fragment (aa 434–1060) of the C-terminal tail domain of talin bound paxillin when recombinant GST-talin tail fragments were incubated with HeLa cell extracts, whereas other fragments (aa 951–2451) did not (Fig. 5G). Because paxillin and talin are components of FAs, we next examined whether paxillin binds to other FA components like vinculin. However, vinculin was not detected in HA3-paxillin immunoprecipitates (Fig. 5H). It may thus be likely that there is a certain specificity for the binding between Ser-85-phosphorylated paxillin and FA molecules. Because we observed that the S85A paxillin mutant did not bind to talin, we examined whether the cellular localization of paxillin is affected by its binding to talin. To this end, we cotransfected cells with HA3-paxillin (WT or S85A) and GFP-WT talin (the N-terminal head domain or the C-terminal tail domain) prior to indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Following cotransfection with GFP-WT talin, WT paxillin co-localized with talin along cell boundaries (82.3 ± 7.3%), whereas S85A paxillin did not (23.5 ± 3.9%) (Fig. 6A), indicating that phospho-Ser-85 paxillin might be required for efficient FAs during cell adhesion and spreading. When cotransfected with the GFP-tagged N-terminal head domain of talin, WT paxillin caused more efficient formation of protrusive processes rather than FAs along the boundaries (79.6 ± 8.5%) than did the S85A mutant, which did not co-localize with talin (18.8 ± 6.8%) (Fig. 6B). When cotransfected with the GFP-tagged C-terminal tail of talin, however, WT paxillin efficiently formed FAs along the cell boundaries (86.2 ± 9.6%), whereas S85A paxillin caused either quite stable FAs or the accumulation of the GFP-talin tail domain in the central area of cells (24.8 ± 4.3%) (Fig. 6C), indicating altered formation of FAs with paxillin when S85A paxillin and the C-terminal domain of talin are cotransfected. Furthermore, another FA marker, vinculin, was not peripherally localized in the cells cotransfected with S85A paxillin and the C-terminal domain of talin (75.2 ± 5.8%) (Fig. 6D). As shown in Fig. 6E, transient transfection of paxillin siRNA could suppress expression efficiently in most transfection-positive cells (97.3 ± 3.8%). In the cells in which endogenous paxillin was suppressed (at least partially) by paxillin siRNA and then reconstituted with S85A paxillin, S85A paxillin and vinculin appeared not to localize at FAs (84.3 ± 4.9%), whereas cells without S85A paxillin introduction (but presumably with a residual endogenous paxillin after paxillin siRNA transfection) showed well established vinculin-positive FAs along the cell peripheries (96.9 ± 3.8%) (Fig. 6F). We next analyzed the dynamic changes in FAs and protrusive process formation via time-lapse microscopy after transfection of cells with mCherry-paxillin (WT or S85A). Cells transfected with mCherry-WT paxillin showed very active dynamic protrusions and FAs along cell boundaries as time progressed, whereas cells transfected with mCherry-S85A paxillin showed very stable boundaries without a dynamic alteration of paxillin localization (Fig. 7 and supplemental Movies 1 and 2). This observation indicates that phospho-Ser-85 paxillin is required for dynamic cell adhesions during cell migration. This study demonstrates that paxillin is phosphorylated at Ser-85 in a cell adhesion-dependent manner and that Ser-85 phosphorylation appears to be important for the signaling activities of FA molecules such as FAK and talin. Ser-85 phosphorylation of paxillin appears to be important for FA formation and actin organization and is also required for its binding to the C-terminal tail domain of talin in an adhesion-dependent manner. Phospho-Ser-85 paxillin-dependent binding to talin correlates with obvious FAs along cell boundaries such that the S85A mutant caused abnormal formation of vinculin- or paxillin-positive FAs in central regions of cells rather than around the cell peripheries. Furthermore, phospho-Ser-85 paxillin is critical for haptotactic but not serum-induced migration and invasion. Therefore, the mechanisms by which phospho-Ser-85 paxillin regulates cell migration/invasion may be attributed to the regulation of FAs and invasive protrusion formation via binding to the C-terminal tail domain of talin. Most previous studies on paxillin have focused on the effects of phosphorylation at Tyr-51 and Tyr-118, which are critically involved in cellular functions such as migration and invasion (12Deakin N.O. Turner C.E. Paxillin comes of age.J. Cell Sci. 2008; 121: 2435-2444Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 18Desiniotis A. Kyprianou N. Significance of talin in cancer progression and metastasis.Int. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2011; 289: 117-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, serine phosphorylation of paxillin is also involved in the regulation of cellular functions (19Brown M.C. Turner C.E. Paxillin: adapting to change.Physiol. Rev. 2004; 84: 1315-1339Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar); for example, phosphorylation of Ser-273 by p21-activated kinase enhances migration, protrusion, and FA turnover via the localization of a paxillin·GIT1·PIX·p21-activated kinase complex at the leading edges of Chinese hamster ovary cells (20Nayal A. Webb D.J. Brown C.M. Schaefer E.M. Vicente-Manzanares M. Horwitz A.R. Paxillin phosphorylation at Ser-273 localizes a GIT1-PIX-PAK complex and regulates adhesion and protrusion dynamics.J. Cell Biol. 2006; 173: 587-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar), and Ser-85 of human paxillin (Ser-83 of rat paxillin) is phosphorylated either by p38MAPK during NGF-induced neurite outgrowth of PC-12 cells or by ERK1/2 during hepatocyte growth factor-mediated morphogenesis of mouse inner medullary collecting duct epithelial cells (mIMCD-3) (14Huang C. Borchers C.H. Schaller M.D. Jacobson K. Phosphorylation of paxillin by p38MAPK is involved in the neurite extension of PC-12 cells.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 16Ishibe S. Joly D. Liu Z.X. Cantley L.G. Paxillin serves as an ERK-regulated scaffold for coordinating FAK and Rac activation in epithelial morphogenesis.Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 257-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Ser-85 of human paxillin (and the corresponding Ser-83 of rat paxillin) is post-translationally modified with O-GlcNAc under hyperglycemic conditions, which competes with cell adhesion-dependent phosphorylation and correlates with the formation of protrusive processes (15Kwak T.K. Kim H. Jung O. Lee S.A. Kang M. Kim H.J. Park J.M. Kim S.H. Lee J.W. Glucosamine treatment-mediated O-GlcNAc modification of paxillin depends on adhesion state of rat insulinoma INS-1 cells.J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285: 36021-36031Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In this study, we also showed that HeLa cell adhesion induced Ser-85 phosphorylation of paxillin and that this effect was inhibited by the pharmacological inhibition of p38MAPK. In addition to NGF-mediated neurite outgrowth in PC-12 cells, phospho-Ser-85 paxillin is involved in the modulation of FA length, although how phospho-Ser-85 paxillin regulates the FAs remains unknown (14Huang C. Borchers C.H. Schaller M.D. Jacobson K. Phosphorylation of paxillin by p38MAPK is involved in the neurite extension of PC-12 cells.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 593-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). During the hepatocyte growth factor-mediated morphogenesis of mIMCD-3 cells, the association between phospho-Ser-85 paxillin and FAK appears to be important for morphogenesis because the S85A mutation inhibits both the association and morphological effects (16Ishibe S. Joly D. Liu Z.X. Cantley L.G. Paxillin serves as an ERK-regulated scaffold for coordinating FAK and Rac activation in epithelial morphogenesis.Mol. Cell. 2004; 16: 257-267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). Similarly, the results of this study indicate that cell adhesion-dependent phospho-Ser-85 paxillin regulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of FA molecules (FAK, paxillin, and talin), FA formation, actin organization, migration, and invasion, given that the S85A paxillin mutation reduced phosphorylation of FAK Tyr-397 and paxillin Tyr-118, FA formation at the periphery, haptotactic migration, and invasive protrusion formation. Interestingly, in contrast to WT paxillin, the S85A mutant could not associate with the C-terminal tail (rod) domain of talin, leading to abnormal intracellular formation of stabilized FAs, including phospho-Tyr-397 FAK (Fig. 1E), HA3-paxillin (Figs. 2 and 6), and vinculin (Fig. 6, D and F). These observations indicate that the efficient dynamics of FA turnover (supported by either WT talin or its C-terminal tail domain) are not possible when phospho-Ser-85 paxillin is unavailable. Furthermore, no phospho-Ser-85 paxillin resulted in an abnormal formation of FAs with vinculin, paxillin, and FAK. Given that paxillin and talin are components of FAs, which are quite complex structures and signaling hubs, phospho-Ser-85 paxillin can lead to changes in phosphorylation events of certain FA molecules. Furthermore, the association of a C-terminal region (aa 434–1060) of talin with paxillin, as shown by co-immunoprecipitation and GST-talin fusion fragment pulldown of paxillin in cell extracts, might be an indirect association mediated by other component(s) such as actin or another FA molecule. It is known that the N-terminal LD [repeated leucine-rich sequences that begin with a leucine (L) and aspartate (D)] domains of paxillin bind directly to the tail domain of vinculin (21Turner C.E. Glenney Jr., J.R. Burridge K. Paxillin: a new vinculin-binding protein present in focal adhesions.J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1059-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar), of which the head domain associates with the stretched tail domain of talin (22del Rio A. Perez-Jimenez R. Liu R. Roca-Cusachs P. Fernandez J.M. Sheetz M.P. Stretching single talin rod molecules activates vinculin binding.Science. 2009; 323: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). It is known that cryptic vinculin-binding sites in the talin tail undergo conformational changes to be stretched on adhesion-mediated force transduction (22del Rio A. Perez-Jimenez R. Liu R. Roca-Cusachs P. Fernandez J.M. Sheetz M.P. Stretching single talin rod molecules activates vinculin binding.Science. 2009; 323: 638-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). However, under certain experimental conditions in this study, the association between talin and paxillin appeared not to be mediated by vinculin because paxillin immunoprecipitates did not include vinculin but rather talin in a Ser-85 phosphorylation-dependent manner. It may be that the talin tail domain is not stretched enough to associate with vinculin in our particular system. Although analyses to test the direct binding between paxillin and talin are still required, it is likely that this binding can still be mediated via another FA component or actin. Talin is an adaptor molecule at FAs (18Desiniotis A. Kyprianou N. Significance of talin in cancer progression and metastasis.Int. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2011; 289: 117-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The N-terminal head domain of talin is responsible for integrin activation presumably during inside-out signaling, whereas the C-terminal tail domain is required for linkage of cell adhesion to actin rearrangement (23Wang P. Ballestrem C. Streuli C.H. The C terminus of talin links integrins to cell cycle progression.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 195: 499-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Because talin is recruited to FAs early after cell adhesion, it has been suggested that talin plays a scaffolding function in recruiting FA molecules and enzymes (24Partridge M.A. Marcantonio E.E. Initiation of attachment and generation of mature focal adhesions by integrin-containing filopodia in cell spreading.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 4237-4248Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Both talin and paxillin are known to be recruited at the earlier FA or contacts (25Scales T.M. Parsons M. Spatial and temporal regulation of integrin signaling during cell migration.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2011; 23: 562-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Furthermore, although the C-terminal tail domain of talin locates at FAs, the N-terminal head domain does not (23Wang P. Ballestrem C. Streuli C.H. The C terminus of talin links integrins to cell cycle progression.J. Cell Biol. 2011; 195: 499-513Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). During time-lapse imaging in this study, cells expressing the S85A paxillin mutant showed less efficient turnover of paxillin-positive staining, whereas cells expressing WT paxillin showed dynamic turnover of paxillin-positive staining along cell boundaries and invasive process formation. Therefore, this study revealed that Ser-85 phosphorylation of paxillin regulates FAs for efficient migration and invasion via its involvement in protein-protein interactions with FA molecules such as talin. Taken together, our findings suggest that the Ser-85 phosphorylation of paxillin upon cell adhesion regulates its interaction with talin and the signaling activities of FA molecules, leading to efficient turnover of FAs along cell boundaries during cell migration and invasion in ECM-rich environments.

During fusion a hydrophobic region of the protein, termed the fusion peptide (FP), is inserted into the target host cell membrane, with subsequent conformational changes culminating in membrane merger. Class I fusion proteins contain FPs between 20 and 30 amino acids in length that are highly conserved within viral families but not between. To examine the sequence dependence of the Hendra virus (HeV) fusion (F) protein FP, the first eight amino acids were mutated first as double, then single, alanine mutants. Mutation of highly conserved glycine residues resulted in inefficient F protein expression and processing, whereas substitution of valine residues resulted in hypofusogenic F proteins despite wild-type surface expression levels. Synthetic peptides corresponding to a portion of the HeV F FP were shown to adopt an α-helical secondary structure in dodecylphosphocholine micelles and small unilamellar vesicles using circular dichroism spectroscopy. Interestingly, peptides containing point mutations that promote lower levels of cell-cell fusion within the context of the whole F protein were less α-helical and induced less membrane disorder in model membranes. These data represent the first extensive structure-function relationship of any paramyxovirus FP and demonstrate that the HeV F FP and potentially other paramyxovirus FPs likely require an α-helical structure for efficient membrane disordering and fusion.

High mortality rates coupled with suspected human-to-human transmission has resulted in both HeV and NiV being classified as biosafety level four (BSL-4) pathogens as well as NIAID category C priority pathogens.

Fusion between the viral and cellular membranes is essential for paramyxovirus infection, as it culminates in the deposition of the viral genome into the target cell. Generally, paramyxovirus-promoted membrane fusion requires the concerted effort of two viral surface glycoproteins (with the notable exception of Pneumovirinae subfamily members): the attachment protein (H, HN, or G), which mediates initial receptor binding, and the fusion (F) protein, which drives membrane merger through a series of extensive conformational changes (6White J.M.

Biol. 2008; 43: 189-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). All paramyxovirus F proteins are trimeric type-I integral membrane proteins and, like other class I fusion proteins, contain several regions critical for fusion promotion (Fig. 1A) including a hydrophobic N-terminal fusion peptide (FP), two heptad repeat (HR) regions (HRA and HRB), and a C-terminal transmembrane domain (TMD). Following proteolytic cleavage, the metastable F protein must be triggered to undergo the vast conformational changes required for membrane fusion. Though the specific mechanism of triggering remains poorly understood, it facilitates extension of HRA toward, and FP insertion into, the target cell membrane (7Asano K. Asano A.

Fusion peptide insertion physically links both the viral and cellular membranes together, coupling the force generated by F rearrangement to membrane merger (10Tamm L.K. Crane J. Kiessling V. Membrane fusion. A structural perspective on the interplay of lipids and proteins.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2003; 13: 453-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Subsequent conformational changes position HRA and HRB in close proximity, culminating in the formation of a stable six-helix bundle and fusion pore formation (11Baker K.A. Dutch R.E. Lamb R.A.

Despite the existence of pre- and post-fusion structures for some paramyxovirus F proteins (12Yin H.S. Wen X. Paterson R.G. Lamb R.A. Jardetzky T.S.

Fusion peptides of class I fusion proteins are highly conserved within viral families, but not between viral families (Fig. 1B). On average, FPs are 20 to 30 amino acids in length and are particularly enriched in glycine and alanine residues (Fig. 1C), likely rendering these regions remarkably flexible and, in the case of isolated peptides, structurally polymorphic (14Tamm L.K.

Previous work examining paramyxovirus FPs has focused on the highly conserved glycine residues (31Sergel T.A. McGinnes L.W. Morrison T.G.

Mutations in the fusion peptide and heptad repeat regions of the Newcastle disease virus fusion protein block fusion.J. Virol. 1994; 68: 7654-7658Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Work with parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5) F demonstrated that mutation of three N-terminal glycine residues (G3, G7, and G12, as named in Ref. 32Russell C.J. Jardetzky T.S. Lamb R.A. Conserved glycine residues in the fusion peptide of the paramyxovirus fusion protein regulate activation of the native state.J. Virol. 2004; 78: 13727-13742Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) dramatically increased membrane fusion while decreasing the requirement for the homotypic attachment protein, suggesting that these residues were critical in pre-fusion F protein stability (32Russell C.J. Jardetzky T.S. Lamb R.A. Conserved glycine residues in the fusion peptide of the paramyxovirus fusion protein regulate activation of the native state.J. Virol. 2004; 78: 13727-13742Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Conversely, similar mutations in Newcastle disease virus (NDV) F and human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV3) F led to moderate increases and, in the case of the G7 mutant of NDV F, decreases in membrane fusion (32Russell C.J. Jardetzky T.S. Lamb R.A. Conserved glycine residues in the fusion peptide of the paramyxovirus fusion protein regulate activation of the native state.J. Virol. 2004; 78: 13727-13742Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), with no change in the requirement for an attachment protein. To examine the sequence requirements of the Hendra F FP, double and single alanine mutations were introduced into the first eight residues of the FP. Mutation of glycine residues within the FP to alanine significantly decreased F protein expression and processing, whereas the VM114/115AA double mutation completely abolished fusion. Circular dichroism spectra of synthetic fusion peptides demonstrated a strong correlation between peptide α-helicity in micelles, cell-cell fusion levels, and the degree of membrane disordering suggesting that the HeV F protein FP requires an α-helical structure for function. Together, these data demonstrate that the combination of at least two single alanine mutations within the FP can lead to dramatic fusion defects, whereas any single mutation is better tolerated. Additionally, these data point toward a role for valine residues in F-promoted fusion, whereas N-terminal glycine residues are important for efficient expression and processing of HeV F. Vero and BSR cells (provided by Karl-Klaus Conzelman, Pettenkofer Institut) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media (DMEM; Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. To select for T7 polymerase-expressing cells, 0.5 mg/ml G-418 sulfate (Invitrogen) was added to the media of the BSR cells every third passage. Plasmids containing Hendra F and G were generously provided by Dr. Lin-Fa Wang (Australian Animal Health Laboratory). All Hendra F mutants were made in pGEM using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and subcloned into pCAGGS as described previously (35Pager C.T. Wurth M.A. Dutch R.E. Subcellular localization and calcium and pH requirements for proteolytic processing of the Hendra virus fusion protein.J. Virol. 2004; 78: 9154-9163Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Resultant constructs were sequenced in their entirety to confirm sequence integrity. Anti-peptide antibodies to residues 527–539 of the Hendra F cytoplasmic tail (35Pager C.T. Wurth M.A. Dutch R.E.

Vero cells in 6-well plates (∼90% confluent) were transiently transfected with pCAGGS-Hendra F (0.5 μg) and pCAGGS-Hendra G (1.5 μg) using Lipofectamine and Plus Reagent (Invitrogen) per manufacturer's protocol. Syncytia formation was observed 24- to 48-h post-transfection, and photographs were taken using a Nikon digital camera mounted atop a Nikon TS100 microscope with a 10× objective. Sub-confluent Vero cells (80–90%) in 60-mm dishes were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine and Plus reagent (3 μg of DNA wild-type or mutant pCAGGS-Hendra F) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Eighteen to twenty-four hours post-transfection, cells were washed with PBS and starved for 45 min in DMEM deficient in cysteine and methionine. Cells were then labeled for 3 h with DMEM deficient in cysteine and methionine containing Tran35S-label (100 μCi/ml; MP Biomedicals, Irvine, CA). After the label, cells were washed 3 times with 3 ml of ice-cold PBS, and surface proteins were biotinylated by the addition of 1 mg/ml EZ-Link Sulfo-NSH-Biotin (Pierce; in PBS) rocking for 35 min at 4 °C followed by incubation at room temperature for 15 min. Cells were then washed an additional 3 times with ice-cold PBS and lysed with 500 μl of radioimmunoprecipitation assay lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% deoxycholic acid, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 25 mm iodoacetaminde (Sigma), and 1 kallikrein inhibitory unit of aprotinin (Calbiochem)). The cellular lysate was centrifuged at 136,500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was removed to a 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tube, and 4 μl of Hendra F peptide antibody was added and incubated for 3 h or overnight at 4 °C followed by incubation with 30 μl of Protein A-Sepharose beads (GE Healthcare) for 30 min. The beads were washed 2× with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer + 0.30 m NaCl, 2× with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer + 0.15 m NaCl, and 1× with SDS Wash II (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 2.5 mm EDTA). Once the beads were washed, 60 μl of 10% SDS was added, and the samples were boiled for 10 min, removed to a new tube, and repeated with 40 μl of 10% SDS for a total of 100 μl. Ten microliters of the supernatant was removed to analyze total population. To the remaining supernatant, 30 μl of Streptavidin beads (Pierce) and 400 μl of biotinylation dilution buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 8), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% bovine serum albumin) were then added for 1 h at 4 °C, rocking. Analysis of Hendra F was performed by 15% SDS-PAGE and visualized using the Typhoon imaging system (GE Healthcare). Band densitometry using ImageQuant 5.2 (GE Healthcare) was performed for each experiment to quantitate the amount of surface-expressed F1 present in each sample. For the DN Rab5 and TPCK (N-tosyl-l-phenylalanine chloromethyl ketone) trypsin experiments, Vero cells were transfected with 1.5 μg of either wild-type or mutant pCAGGS-Hendra F and 1.5 μg of DN-Rab5, and the experiment was performed as described above, except with the addition of 1 μg/ml of TPCK-trypsin to the label media. Vero cells in 6-well plates were transiently transfected with 0.9 μg of wild-type pCAGGS-Hendra G, 0.3 μg of wild-type or mutant pCAGGS-Hendra F, and 0.8 μg of T7 luciferase under the control of the T7 promoter (2 μg total DNA) using Lipofectamine and Plus reagent per the manufacturer's protocol. Eighteen hours post-transfection, Vero cells were washed 1× with PBS and overlaid with BSR cells (∼1:1) stably expressing the T7 polymerase for 3 h at 37 °C. Cells were lysed and assayed for luciferase activity using the luciferase assay system from Promega (Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. An Lmax luminometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) was used to measure light emission; a 2-s delay and 8-s read time were used. Values were normalized to samples containing wild-type pCAGGS-Hendra F and G, with wild-type set at 100%, after subtraction of the pCAGGS-Hendra G alone values. Five peptides were used in this study: guest, GCGKKKK; wild-type, LAGVVMAGIAIGIATA GCGKKKK; VM114/115AA; LAGVAAAGIAIGIATAGCGKKKK; V114A, LAGVAMAGIAIGIATAGCGKKKK; M115A, LAGVVAAGIAIGIATAGCGKKKK. This host guest system was first described by Han and Tamm (16Han X. Tamm L.K. A host-guest system to study structure-function relationships of membrane fusion peptides.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2000; 97: 13097-13102Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Peptides used in this study were obtained from either GenScript (Piscataway, NJ) or NEO-Peptide (Cambridge, MA) and were purified to ≥95% purity by reverse-phase HPLC, with peptide identities confirmed by mass spectrometry. The C terminus of each peptide was amidated, whereas the N terminus was unmodified. Stock peptide solutions were made by resuspending peptides in sterile, deionized water, and amino acid analysis was performed (W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University, New Haven, CT) to determine the concentrations of all stock solutions. Working stocks of 750 μm in sterile, deionized water were prepared, and all stock solutions were stored as small aliquots and kept at −20 °C. Chicken red blood cells (RBCs) were purchased from Innovative Research (Novi, MI) as a 5% v/v suspension in PBS and were used within 2 weeks of purchase. For the hemolysis studies, chicken RBCs were diluted to 2% with PBS immediately before use. The final reaction volume for each sample was 300 μl, consisting of 260 μl of 2% chicken RBCs and 40 μl of either peptide, water, or a mixture of the 2 in a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube. Final peptide concentration was between 0 and 100 μm. Samples were incubated at 37 °C for 45 min and centrifuged at 3000 × g, and supernatant was removed to another tube. Absorbance of each sample was then taken at 520 nm with complete hemolysis obtained after lysing chicken RBCs with 0.5% Triton X-100. Absorbance values were then expressed as a percent of values obtained from Triton X-100 lysis. Dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles were prepared 1 day before use by drying the DPC/chloroform solution under a continuous nitrogen stream. Residual chloroform was removed by placing the DPC sample under a vacuum for 30 min. Dried DPC was then resuspended in 5 mm HEPES, 10 mm MES buffer (pH 7.4) by gently shaking for 20 min and then stored at 4 °C until use the next morning. For experiments using different peptide:DPC ratios, separate micelle preparations were made for each ratio. Circular dichroism (CD) spectra were measured with a Jasco J-810 spectrapolarimeter using a quartz cuvette with a 1-mm path length. All measurements were performed at 22 °C, and each spectrum is an average of 4 scans with 3 independent spectra taken for each sample. Spectra were measured in 5 mm HEPES, 10 mm MES buffer (pH 7.4) plus or minus 10 mm DPC (Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL) with peptide concentrations of 100 μm (peptide:DPC ratio of 1:100). Background spectra without peptide were collected and subtracted from spectra taken in the presence of peptide. Estimation of the fraction of residues in α-helical formation was performed as previously described (36Han X. Tamm L.K. pH-dependent self-association of influenza hemagglutinin fusion peptides in lipid bilayers.J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 304: 953-965Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). CD spectra using small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) spectra were acquired on an Aviv model 215 spectropolarimeter in a 0.5-mm quartz cell at 22 °C. Data were collected from 200–260 nm. Experiments were collected with 100 μm peptide in 5 mm Hepes, 10 mm MES buffer with and without 5 mm POPC:POPG SUVs. Appropriate amounts of stock POPC and POPG in chloroform were mixed and evaporated to a film with a nitrogen stream. The films were hydrated with 5 mm Hepes 10 mm MES buffer and sonicated with a Branson ultra-sonicator equipped with a titanium tip on ice until the vesicle solution became clear. Titanium particles were removed by centrifugation. Planar single bilayers were prepared using a Langmuir trough. A monolayer of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was spread on the trough. A germanium attenuated total reflectance (ATR)-IR plate was dipped into the trough and slowly removed to transfer a single 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine monolayer. To form the second lipid leaflet, the plate was incubated with SUVs composed of POPC:POPG 95:5 in a chamber for 1–2 h. Excess vesicles were washed away with 2 ml of D2O buffer (37Frey S. Tamm L.K.

The phosphate donors are dTTP, dGTP, and ribo-GTP as well as the thymidine and guanosine triphosphate analogs ddTTP, ddGTP, and dITP. The nucleotide kinase is found in solution as a 256-kDa complex consisting of ∼12 monomers of the gene 1.7 protein. The two molecular weight forms co-purify as a complex, but each form has nearly identical kinase activity. Although gene 1.7 protein does not require a metal ion for its kinase activity, the presence of Mg2+ in the reaction mixture results in either inhibition or stimulation of the rate of kinase reactions depending on the substrates used. Both the dTMP and dGMP kinase reactions are reversible. Neither dTDP nor dGDP is a phosphate acceptor of nucleoside triphosphate donors. Gene 1.7 protein exhibits two different equilibrium patterns toward deoxyguanosine and thymidine substrates. The Km of 4.4 × 10−4 m obtained with dTTP for dTMP kinase is ∼3-fold higher than that obtained with dGTP for dGMP kinase (1.3 × 10−4 m), indicating that a higher concentration of dTTP is required to saturate the enzyme. Inhibition studies indicate a competitive relationship between dGDP and both dGTP, dGMP, whereas dTDP appears to have a mixed type of inhibition of dTMP kinase. Studies suggest two functions of dTTP, as a phosphate donor and a positive effector of the dTMP kinase reaction. Gene 1.7 protein is the only known nucleotide kinase encoded by bacteriophage T7.

https://openalex.org/W2141178214,"Polymorphisms have poorly understood effects on drug susceptibility and may affect the outcome of HIV treatment. We have discovered that an HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) polymorphism (RT(172K)) is present in clinical samples and in widely used laboratory strains (BH10), and it profoundly affects HIV-1 susceptibility to both nucleoside (NRTIs) and non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs) when combined with certain mutations. Polymorphism 172K significantly suppressed zidovudine resistance caused by excision (e.g. thymidine-associated mutations) and not by discrimination mechanism mutations (e.g. Q151M complex). Moreover, it attenuated resistance to nevirapine or efavirenz imparted by NNRTI mutations. Although 172K favored RT-DNA binding at an excisable pre-translocation conformation, it decreased excision by thymidine-associated mutation-containing RT. 172K affected DNA handling and decreased RT processivity without significantly affecting the k(cat)/K(m) values for dNTP. Surface plasmon resonance experiments revealed that RT(172K) decreased DNA binding by increasing the dissociation rate. Hence, the increased zidovudine susceptibility of RT(172K) results from its increased dissociation from the chain-terminated DNA and reduced primer unblocking. We solved a high resolution (2.15 Å) crystal structure of RT mutated at 172 and compared crystal structures of RT(172R) and RT(172K) bound to NNRTIs or DNA/dNTP. Our structural analyses highlight differences in the interactions between α-helix E (where 172 resides) and the active site β9-strand that involve the YMDD loop and the NNRTI binding pocket. Such changes may increase dissociation of DNA, thus suppressing excision-based NRTI resistance and also offset the effect of NNRTI resistance mutations thereby restoring NNRTI binding."
https://openalex.org/W2051999018,"Bone resorption, which is regulated by osteoclasts, is excessively activated in bone destructive diseases such as osteoporosis. Thus, controlling osteoclasts would be an effective strategy to prevent pathological bone loss. Although several transcription factors that regulate osteoclast differentiation and function could serve as molecular targets to inhibit osteoclast formation, those factors have not yet been characterized using a loss of function approach in adults. Here we report such a study showing that inactivation of B-lymphocyte induced maturation protein 1 (Blimp1) in adult mice increases bone mass by suppressing osteoclast formation. Using an ex vivo assay, we show that osteoclast differentiation is significantly inhibited by Blimp1 inactivation at an early stage of osteoclastogenesis. Conditional inactivation of Blimp1 inhibited osteoclast formation and increased bone mass in both male and female adult mice. Bone resorption parameters were significantly reduced by Blimp1 inactivation in vivo. Blimp1 reportedly regulates immune cell differentiation and function, but we detected no immune cell failure following Blimp1 inactivation. These data suggest that Blimp1 is a potential target to promote increased bone mass and prevent osteoclastogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2024735337,"Increased cellular production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is responsible for the development and progression of multiple cancers and other neovascular conditions, and therapies targeting post-translational VEGF products are used in the treatment of these diseases. Development of methods to control and modify the transcription of the VEGF gene is an alternative approach that may have therapeutic potential. We have previously shown that isoforms of the transcriptional enhancer factor 1-related (TEAD4) protein can enhance the production of VEGF. In this study we describe a new TEAD4 isoform, TEAD4(216), which represses VEGF promoter activity. The TEAD4(216) isoform inhibits human VEGF promoter activity and does not require the presence of the hypoxia responsive element (HRE), which is the sequence critical to hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-mediated effects. The TEAD4(216) protein is localized to the cytoplasm, whereas the enhancer isoforms are found within the nucleus. The TEAD4(216) isoform can competitively repress the stimulatory activity of the TEAD4(434) and TEAD4(148) enhancers. Synthesis of the native VEGF(165) protein and cellular proliferation is suppressed by the TEAD4(216) isoform. Mutational analysis indicates that nuclear or cytoplasmic localization of any isoform determines whether it acts as an enhancer or repressor, respectively. The TEAD4(216) isoform appears to inhibit VEGF production independently of the HRE required activity by HIF, suggesting that this alternatively spliced isoform of TEAD4 may provide a novel approach to treat VEGF-dependent diseases."
