https://openalex.org/W2948930564,"Microsatellite instability determines whether patients with gastrointestinal cancer respond exceptionally well to immunotherapy. However, in clinical practice, not every patient is tested for MSI, because this requires additional genetic or immunohistochemical tests. Here we show that deep residual learning can predict MSI directly from H&E histology, which is ubiquitously available. This approach has the potential to provide immunotherapy to a much broader subset of patients with gastrointestinal cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2946861851,"Heterotrimetic G proteins consist of four subfamilies (Gs, Gi/o, Gq/11, and G12/13) that mediate signaling via G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), principally by receptors binding Gα C termini. G-protein-coupling profiles govern GPCR-induced cellular responses, yet receptor sequence selectivity determinants remain elusive. Here, we systematically quantified ligand-induced interactions between 148 GPCRs and all 11 unique Gα subunit C termini. For each receptor, we probed chimeric Gα subunit activation via a transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) shedding response in HEK293 cells lacking endogenous Gq/11 and G12/13 proteins, and complemented G-protein-coupling profiles through a NanoBiT-G-protein dissociation assay. Interrogation of the dataset identified sequence-based coupling specificity features, inside and outside the transmembrane domain, which we used to develop a coupling predictor that outperforms previous methods. We used the predictor to engineer designer GPCRs selectively coupled to G12. This dataset of fine-tuned signaling mechanisms for diverse GPCRs is a valuable resource for research in GPCR signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2948512992,"We recently derived mouse expanded potential stem cells (EPSCs) from individual blastomeres by inhibiting the critical molecular pathways that predispose their differentiation. EPSCs had enriched molecular signatures of blastomeres and possessed developmental potency for all embryonic and extra-embryonic cell lineages. Here, we report the derivation of porcine EPSCs, which express key pluripotency genes, are genetically stable, permit genome editing, differentiate to derivatives of the three germ layers in chimeras and produce primordial germ cell-like cells in vitro. Under similar conditions, human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells can be converted, or somatic cells directly reprogrammed, to EPSCs that display the molecular and functional attributes reminiscent of porcine EPSCs. Importantly, trophoblast stem-cell-like cells can be generated from both human and porcine EPSCs. Our pathway-inhibition paradigm thus opens an avenue for generating mammalian pluripotent stem cells, and EPSCs present a unique cellular platform for translational research in biotechnology and regenerative medicine."
https://openalex.org/W2948477377,"It is estimated that 350 million individuals worldwide suffer from rare diseases, which are predominantly caused by mutation in a single gene1. The current molecular diagnostic rate is estimated at 50%, with whole-exome sequencing (WES) among the most successful approaches2-5. For patients in whom WES is uninformative, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) has shown diagnostic utility in specific tissues and diseases6-8. This includes muscle biopsies from patients with undiagnosed rare muscle disorders6,9, and cultured fibroblasts from patients with mitochondrial disorders7. However, for many individuals, biopsies are not performed for clinical care, and tissues are difficult to access. We sought to assess the utility of RNA-seq from blood as a diagnostic tool for rare diseases of different pathophysiologies. We generated whole-blood RNA-seq from 94 individuals with undiagnosed rare diseases spanning 16 diverse disease categories. We developed a robust approach to compare data from these individuals with large sets of RNA-seq data for controls (n = 1,594 unrelated controls and n = 49 family members) and demonstrated the impacts of expression, splicing, gene and variant filtering strategies on disease gene identification. Across our cohort, we observed that RNA-seq yields a 7.5% diagnostic rate, and an additional 16.7% with improved candidate gene resolution."
https://openalex.org/W2791747373,"Quantum physics was invented to account for two fundamental features of measurement results -- their discreetness and randomness. Emblematic of these features is Bohr's idea of quantum jumps between two discrete energy levels of an atom. Experimentally, quantum jumps were first observed in an atomic ion driven by a weak deterministic force while under strong continuous energy measurement. The times at which the discontinuous jump transitions occur are reputed to be fundamentally unpredictable. Can there be, despite the indeterminism of quantum physics, a possibility to know if a quantum jump is about to occur or not? Here, we answer this question affirmatively by experimentally demonstrating that the jump from the ground to an excited state of a superconducting artificial three-level atom can be tracked as it follows a predictable ""flight,"" by monitoring the population of an auxiliary energy level coupled to the ground state. The experimental results demonstrate that the jump evolution when completed is continuous, coherent, and deterministic. Furthermore, exploiting these features and using real-time monitoring and feedback, we catch and reverse a quantum jump mid-flight, thus deterministically preventing its completion. Our results, which agree with theoretical predictions essentially without adjustable parameters, support the modern quantum trajectory theory and provide new ground for the exploration of real-time intervention techniques in the control of quantum systems, such as early detection of error syndromes."
https://openalex.org/W2948268330,"Learning to predict rewards based on environmental cues is essential for survival. The orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) contributes to such learning by conveying reward-related information to brain areas such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA). Despite this, how cue-reward memory representations form in individual OFC neurons and are modified based on new information is unknown. To address this, using in vivo two-photon calcium imaging in mice, we tracked the response evolution of thousands of OFC output neurons, including those projecting to VTA, through multiple days and stages of cue-reward learning. Collectively, we show that OFC contains several functional clusters of neurons distinctly encoding cue-reward memory representations, with only select responses routed downstream to VTA. Unexpectedly, these representations were stably maintained by the same neurons even after extinction of the cue-reward pairing, and supported behavioral learning and memory. Thus, OFC neuronal activity represents a long-term cue-reward associative memory to support behavioral adaptation."

Study design This longitudinal case-control study included 90 patients with a normal pregnancy and 33 patients with early preeclampsia. Two to six maternal plasma samples were collected throughout gestation from each woman. The abundance of 1,125 proteins was measured using high-affinity aptamer-based proteomic assays, and data were modeled using linear mixed-effects models. After data transformation into multiples of the mean values for gestational age, parsimonious linear discriminant analysis risk models were fit for each gestational-age interval (8–16, 16.1–22, 22.1–28, 28.1–32 weeks). Proteomic profiles of early preeclampsia cases were also compared to those of a combined set of controls and late preeclampsia cases (n = 76) reported previously. Prediction performance was estimated via bootstrap. Results We found that 1) multi-protein models at 16.1–22 weeks of gestation predicted early preeclampsia with a sensitivity of 71% at a false-positive rate (FPR) of 10%. High abundance of matrix metalloproteinase-7 and glycoprotein IIbIIIa complex were the most reliable predictors at this gestational age; 2) at 22.1–28 weeks of gestation, lower abundance of placental growth factor (PlGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor A, isoform 121 (VEGF-121), as well as elevated sialic acid binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 6 (siglec-6) and activin-A, were the best predictors of the subsequent development of early preeclampsia (81% sensitivity, FPR = 10%); 3) at 28.1–32 weeks of gestation, the sensitivity of multi-protein models was 85% (FPR = 10%) with the best predictors being activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule, siglec-6, and VEGF-121; 4) the increase in siglec-6, activin-A, and VEGF-121 at 22.1–28 weeks of gestation differentiated women who subsequently developed early preeclampsia from those who had a normal pregnancy or developed late preeclampsia (sensitivity 77%, FPR = 10%); 5) the sensitivity of risk models was higher for early preeclampsia with placental MVM lesions than for the entire early preeclampsia group (90% versus 71% at 16.1–22 weeks; 87% versus 81% at 22.1–28 weeks; and 90% versus 85% at 28.1–32 weeks, all FPR = 10%); and 6) the sensitivity of prediction models was higher for severe early preeclampsia than for the entire early preeclampsia group (84% versus 71% at 16.1–22 weeks). Conclusion We have presented herein a catalogue of proteome changes in maternal plasma proteome that precede the diagnosis of preeclampsia and can distinguish among early and late phenotypes. The sensitivity of maternal plasma protein models for early preeclampsia is higher in women with underlying vascular placental disease and in those with a severe phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2950644286,"In vertebrates, multipotent progenitors located in the pharyngeal mesoderm form cardiomyocytes and branchiomeric head muscles, but the dynamic gene expression programmes and mechanisms underlying cardiopharyngeal multipotency and heart versus head muscle fate choices remain elusive. Here, we used single-cell genomics in the simple chordate model Ciona to reconstruct developmental trajectories forming first and second heart lineages and pharyngeal muscle precursors and characterize the molecular underpinnings of cardiopharyngeal fate choices. We show that FGF–MAPK signalling maintains multipotency and promotes the pharyngeal muscle fate, whereas signal termination permits the deployment of a pan-cardiac programme, shared by the first and second heart lineages, to define heart identity. In the second heart lineage, a Tbx1/10-Dach pathway actively suppresses the first heart lineage programme, conditioning later cell diversity in the beating heart. Finally, cross-species comparisons between Ciona and the mouse evoke the deep evolutionary origins of cardiopharyngeal networks in chordates. Wang et al. map early cardiopharyngeal development in the chordate model Ciona and show that FGF–MAPK signalling maintains multipotency and promotes pharyngeal muscle fate, whereas Tbx1/10-Dach specify second heart lineage identity."
https://openalex.org/W2948322052,"Chromatin assembled with the histone H3 variant CENP-A is the heritable epigenetic determinant of human centromere identity. Using genome-wide mapping and reference models for 23 human centromeres, CENP-A binding sites are identified within the megabase-long, repetitive α-satellite DNAs at each centromere. CENP-A is shown in early G1 to be assembled into nucleosomes within each centromere and onto 11,390 transcriptionally active sites on the chromosome arms. DNA replication is demonstrated to remove ectopically loaded, non-centromeric CENP-A. In contrast, tethering of centromeric CENP-A to the sites of DNA replication through the constitutive centromere associated network (CCAN) is shown to enable precise reloading of centromere-bound CENP-A onto the same DNA sequences as in its initial prereplication loading. Thus, DNA replication acts as an error correction mechanism for maintaining centromere identity through its removal of non-centromeric CENP-A coupled with CCAN-mediated retention and precise reloading of centromeric CENP-A. Cleveland and colleagues report a DNA-replication-dependent error correction mechanism that acts in S phase to remove ectopically loaded CENP-A outside the centromeres, while retaining centromere-bound CENP-A."
https://openalex.org/W2948403725,"Background Method-specific contraceptive prevalence varies widely globally, as huge variations exist in the use of different types of contraception, with short-term methods being the most common methods in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Evidence is scanty on the trends, patterns and determinants of long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods in SSA. This study aimed to address this knowledge gap. Methods Using a pseudo longitudinal research design and descriptive and inferential statistics, we analysed Demographic and Health Survey data of eight countries selected on the basis of contraceptive prevalence rates across SSA. Multinomial logistic regression modelling was used to tease out the predictors of the uptake of LARC methods in the selected countries. Results Findings exhibit a steady but slow upward trend in LARC methods across selected countries, as a marginal increase was recorded in LARC uptake over a 10-year period in many of the selected countries. Results established significant predictors of LARC methods uptake, including fertility-related characteristics, age, level of education, work status, wealth index and exposure to mass media. This study underscored the need to address various barriers to the uptake of LARC methods in SSA. It is recommended that governments at different levels undertake to cover the costs of LARC methods in order to increase access and uptake."
https://openalex.org/W2948419197,"Diabetes nephropathy (DN) is characterized by abnormal interactions between kidney-infiltrating macrophages and glomerular mesangial cells. Recently, a novel cell-cell communication mediated by exosomes has gained attention. Exosomes are membrane-bound vesicles that contain a variety of molecules such as proteins, lipids, DNA, mRNA, and microRNAs. Exosomes play an important role in the pathogenesis of DN. In this study, we show that high glucose (HG) led to increased excretion of exosomes from macrophages. Mesangial cells took up exosomes in vitro, which resulted in the activation and proliferation of mesangial cells and the secretion of extracellular matrix and inflammatory cytokines. In addition, C57BL/6 mice injected with exosomes from HG-treated macrophages showed morphologic and functional changes. We then showed that exosomes from HG-treated TGF-β1 knockdown macrophages induced less extracellular matrix and fewer inflammatory factors in mesangial cells compared with vector control. Our findings suggest that TGF-β1 mRNA in exosomes serves a role between macrophages and mesangial cells by activating the TGF-β1/ mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3 pathway.-Zhu, Q.-J., Zhu, M., Xu, M.-X., Meng, X.-M., Wu, Y.-G.

https://openalex.org/W2902323537,"The Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1) is a member of the cold shock domain (CSD) protein family and is recognized as an oncogenic factor in several solid tumors. By binding to RNA, YB-1 participates in several steps of posttranscriptional regulation of gene expression, including mRNA splicing, stability, and translation; microRNA processing; and stress granule assembly. However, the mechanisms in YB-1-mediated regulation of RNAs are unclear. Previously, we used both systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) and individual-nucleotide resolution UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation coupled RNA-Seq (iCLIP-Seq) analyses, which defined the RNA-binding consensus sequence of YB-1 as CA(U/C)C. We also reported that through binding to its core motif CAUC in primary transcripts, YB-1 regulates the alternative splicing of a CD44 variable exon and the biogenesis of miR-29b-2 during both Drosha and Dicer steps. To elucidate the molecular basis of the YB-1-RNA interactions, we report high-resolution crystal structures of the YB-1 CSD in complex with different RNA oligos at 1.7 Å resolution. The structure revealed that CSD interacts with RNA mainly through π-π stacking interactions assembled by four highly conserved aromatic residues. Interestingly, YB-1 CSD forms a homodimer in solution, and we observed that two residues, Tyr-99 and Asp-105, at the dimer interface are important for YB-1 CSD dimerization. Substituting these two residues with Ala reduced CSD's RNA-binding activity and abrogated the splicing activation of YB-1 targets. The YB-1 CSD-RNA structures presented here at atomic resolution provide mechanistic insights into gene expression regulated by CSD-containing proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2948669956,"Many mRNA-based vaccines have been investigated for their specific potential to activate dendritic cells (DCs), the highly-specialized antigen-presenting cells of the immune system that play a key role in inducing effective CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses. In this paper we report a new vaccine/gene delivery platform that demonstrates the benefits of using a self-amplifying (“replicon”) mRNA that is protected in a viral-protein capsid. Purified capsid protein from the plant virus Cowpea Chlorotic Mottle Virus (CCMV) is used to in vitro assemble monodisperse virus-like particles (VLPs) containing reporter proteins (e.g., Luciferase or eYFP) or the tandem-repeat model antigen SIINFEKL in RNA gene form, coupled to the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase from the Nodamura insect virus. Incubation of immature DCs with these VLPs results in increased activation of maturation markers – CD80, CD86 and MHC-II – and enhanced RNA replication levels, relative to incubation with unpackaged replicon mRNA. Higher RNA uptake/replication and enhanced DC activation were detected in a dose-dependent manner when the CCMV-VLPs were pre-incubated with anti-CCMV antibodies. In all experiments the expression of maturation markers correlates with the RNA levels of the DCs. Overall, these studies demonstrate that: VLP protection enhances mRNA uptake by DCs; coupling replicons to the gene of interest increases RNA and protein levels in the cell; and the presence of anti-VLP antibodies enhances mRNA levels and activation of DCs in vitro. Finally, preliminary in vivo experiments involving mouse vaccinations with SIINFEKL-replicon VLPs indicate a small but significant increase in antigen-specific T cells that are doubly positive for IFN and TFN induction."

In the yeast F-ATP synthase, subunits e and g of the FO sector constitute a lateral domain, which is required for dimer stability and cristae formation. Here, by using site-directed mutagenesis, we identified Arg-8 of subunit e as a critical residue in mediating interactions between subunits e and g, most likely through an interaction with Glu-83 of subunit g. Consistent with this hypothesis, (i) the substitution of Arg-8 in subunit e (eArg-8) with Ala or Glu or of Glu-83 in subunit g (gGlu-83) with Ala or Lys destabilized the digitonin-extracted F-ATP synthase, resulting in decreased dimer formation as revealed by blue-native electrophoresis; and (ii) simultaneous substitution of eArg-8 with Glu and of gGlu-83 with Lys rescued digitonin-stable F-ATP synthase dimers. When tested in lipid bilayers for generation of Ca2+-dependent channels, WT dimers displayed the high-conductance channel activity expected for the mitochondrial megachannel/permeability transition pore, whereas dimers obtained at low digitonin concentrations from the Arg-8 variants displayed currents of strikingly small conductance. Remarkably, double replacement of eArg-8 with Glu and of gGlu-83 with Lys restored high-conductance channels indistinguishable from those seen in WT enzymes.

The mitochondrial F-ATP synthase is a molecular rotary motor that uses the protonmotive force existing across the inner membrane of the organelle to make ATP from ADP and phosphate.

This study aimed at testing whether charged amino acids are also involved in the association of the dimer-specific subunits e and g in yeast and at assessing whether the subunit e/g interface plays a role in MMC/PTP activity. Arg-8 of subunit e (eArg-8), encoded by the yeast TIM11 gene, is the only arginine conserved across species (Fig. S1A). We substituted eArg-8 with either Ala or Glu in S. cerevisiae strain BY4743 using site-directed mutagenesis. These two subunit e variants were expressed in the ΔTIM11 mutant lacking subunit e. As a control, we also re-expressed the WT subunit e in the ΔTIM11 mutant (TIM11 WT). Mitochondrial proteins from TIM11 R8A and R8E mutants were extracted with increasing digitonin concentrations and compared with those from ΔTIM11 and TIM11 WT strains, as well as to those from the mutant strain lacking subunit g (ΔATP20). BN-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining and in-gel ATPase activity assays revealed that, as expected, the ΔTIM11 and ΔATP20 mutants displayed only monomers irrespective of the digitonin–to–protein ratios, whereas in the BY4743 and TIM11 WT strains dimers were readily detectable along with monomers at all digitonin concentrations. In contrast, in the extracts from TIM11 R8A and R8E mutants, dimers were present at low but not at higher digitonin–to–protein ratios (Fig. 1A and Fig. S2, A–D). Comparison of the dimer/monomer ratios of the different genotypes demonstrates that in the TIM11 R8A and R8E mutants the presence of dimers was dramatically decreased (Fig. 1B). In the TIM11 R8A and R8E mutants the expression levels of subunits e and g relative to subunit b were similar to those of the TIM11 WT strain both in whole-cell and mitochondrial lysates (Fig. 1, C and D). Consistent with an earlier study (12Arnold I. Pfeiffer K. Neupert W. Stuart R.A. Schägger H. Yeast mitochondrial F1F0-ATP synthase exists as a dimer: identification of three dimer-specific subunits.EMBO J. 1998; 17 (9857174): 7170-717810.1093/emboj/17.24.7170Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar), in the ΔTIM11 mutant subunit g was not detected, whereas in the ΔATP20 mutant lacking subunit g cellular and mitochondrial steady-state levels of subunit e were slightly decreased compared with the BY4743 strain (Fig. 1C). The generation times of TIM11 R8A and TIM11 R8E mutants cultured in the selective respiratory liquid medium (Drop-out–uracil containing 1% v/v ethanol and 1% v/v glycerol) were not significantly different from those of the BY4743 and TIM11 WT strains (Fig. S3A). Also, respiratory rates and respiratory control ratios of the TIM11 R8A and R8E mutants were comparable with those of TIM11 WT mitochondria (Fig. S3B). Somewhat surprisingly, the TIM11 R8A and R8E mutants also displayed a normal mitochondrial morphology, which was indistinguishable from that of the TIM11 WT or BY4743 strains (Fig. S4). In contrast, and as expected based on previous work (13Paumard P. Vaillier J. Coulary B. Schaeffer J. Soubannier V. Mueller D.M. Brèthes D. di Rago J.P. Velours J. The ATP synthase is involved in generating mitochondrial cristae morphology.EMBO J. 2002; 21 (11823415): 221-23010.1093/emboj/21.3.221Crossref PubMed Scopus (589) Google Scholar, 14Arselin G.

These findings suggest that the TIM11 R8A and R8E mutations do not cause major effects on F-ATP synthase assembly, but they do cause an increased tendency of the dimers to dissociate when extracted with digitonin and run in BN-polyacrylamide gels. CuCl2 treatment leads to F-ATP synthase dimer formation even in mutants lacking subunit e (ΔTIM11) or subunit g (ΔATP20) through copper-induced formation of disulfide bridges that can be easily detected by BN-PAGE (22Carraro M.

After cross-linking with copper, dimer/monomer ratios similar to those of the WT genotypes were observed in ΔTIM11, ΔATP20, TIM11 R8A, and TIM11 R8E mutants (Fig. 2A). To assess the relative abundance of subunit e after CuCl2 treatment, the BN gels were transferred to PVDF membranes and immunoblotted for subunit b or e. The levels of subunit b were consistent with the protein abundance detected in BN gels, and as expected, subunit e was present in the dimers of WT BY4743 and TIM11 WT strains and absent in the ΔTIM11 mutant (Fig. 2B). Remarkably, deletion of subunit g prevented accommodation of subunit e within F-ATP synthase dimers; indeed, subunit e was almost exclusively associated with the monomers despite the enforced dimerization induced by copper (Fig. 2B). A similar, albeit smaller, effect was caused by the TIM11 R8A and R8E mutations in subunit e, where a fraction of the protein was found in the monomers (Fig. 2B). This is a novel finding suggesting that each of these point mutations decreases the strength of interaction between subunits e and g and therefore dimer stability. We also analyzed extracts of mitochondria not treated with copper by clear native gel electrophoresis (CN-PAGE), followed by immunoblotting. CN-PAGE is milder than BN-PAGE because the dimeric structures of F-ATP synthase are better preserved in the absence of the anionic Coomassie dye (32Wittig I. Schägger H.

Dimers were clearly identified in all strains, including the ΔTIM11 and ΔATP20 mutants (Fig. 2C). However, and consistent with the results of the BN-PAGE analysis in Fig. 1A, substitution of eArg-8 in the TIM11 R8A and R8E mutants decreased the abundance of dimers, especially at higher digitonin (Fig. 2C). Also in these protocols, subunit e was not detected in the dimers of the ΔATP20 mutant lacking subunit g, and a small fraction of subunit e was associated with F-ATP synthase monomers in the TIM11 R8A and R8E mutants (Fig. 2D). Subunit g possesses two Glu residues, the only two negatively charged amino acids conserved in this subunit (Fig. S1B). To investigate whether they interact with Arg-8 of subunit e, we generated alanine and lysine mutants at Glu-83 and Glu-102 (which is located within the GXXXG motif) of subunit g. The four mutated and WT subunits g were re-expressed in the ΔATP20 mutant (lacking subunit g), and the digitonin extracts of mitochondria were analyzed by BN-PAGE. As expected, the ΔATP20 mutant displayed only monomers, whereas in the BY4743 and ATP20 WT strains dimers were clearly detectable along with monomers (Fig. 3, A and B). Interestingly, the dimer/monomer ratios of the ATP20 E83A and ATP20 E83K mutants were significantly decreased, whereas the ATP20 R102A or ATP20 R102K mutation had no effect (Fig. 3, A and B). The expression levels of subunits e and g were unaffected by these mutations (Fig. S5). Thus, the significant reduction of dimeric complexes in the ATP20 E83A and E83K mutants cannot be explained by reduced steady-state levels of the mutated subunit g. Remarkably, the combination of an R8E mutation in subunit e with an E83K mutation in subunit g was able to rescue dimer formation, which was detectable in BN gels, similar to the re-expression of TIM11 and ATP20 WT (Fig. 3C). The ΔTIM11ΔATP20 mutant had a significantly longer generation time than the BY4743 strain (Fig. S3A). Ablation of TIM11 and ATP20 followed by re-expression of TIM11 R8E and ATP20 E83K did not significantly affect growth and respiratory properties of the mutants, which came close to those of the strain re-expressing WT TIM11 + ATP20 (Fig. S3, A and C). These data indicate that Glu-83 of subunit g participates in the interaction with Arg-8 of subunit e thus favoring dimer stability. Based on the possible role of subunit e in formation of a Ca2+-dependent, MMC/PTP-like channel by F-ATP synthase (22Carraro M. Gio"

To understand whether UV inflorescence cues affect the attraction of nectar-foraging mosquitoes, we worked with the common house mosquito, Culex pipiens and with two plant species exhibiting floral UV cues: the tansy, Tanacetum vulgare, and the common hawkweed Hieraciumm lachenalii. Electroretinograms revealed that Cx. pipiens eyes can sense UV wavelengths, with peak sensitivity at 335 nm. Behavioural bioassays divulged that UV inflorescence cues enhance the attractiveness of inflorescence odour. In the presence of natural floral odour, female Cx. pipiens were attracted to floral patterns of UV-absorption and UV-reflection but preferred uniformly UV-dark inflorescences. Moreover, Cx. pipiens females preferred UV-dark and black inflorescence models to UV-dark and yellow inflorescence models. With feathers and pelts of many avian and mammalian hosts also being UV-dark and dark-coloured, foraging Cx. pipiens females may respond to analogous visual cues when they seek nectar and vertebrate blood resources."

In this study, a series of synthetic 7-methoxy-indolizine derivatives were synthesised, characterised and evaluated for in vitro whole-cell anti-tuberculosis (TB) screening against susceptible (H37Rv) and multi-drug-resistant (MDR) strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) using the resazurin microplate assay method. The cytotoxicity was evaluated using the MTT assay. In silico molecular-docking study was conducted for compounds 5a-j against enoyl-[acyl-carrier] protein reductase, a key enzyme of the type II fatty acid synthesis that has attracted much interest for the development of novel anti-TB compounds. Thereafter, molecular dynamic (MD) simulation was undertaken for the most active inhibitors. Compounds 5i and 5j with the methoxy functional group at the meta position of the benzoyl group, which was at the third position of the indolizine nucleus, demonstrated encouraging anti-TB activity against MDR strains of MTB at 16 μg/mL. In silico studies showed binding affinity within the range of 7.07-8.57 kcal/mol, with 5i showing the highest binding affinity. Hydrogen bonding, π-π- interactions, and electrostatic interactions were common with the active site. Most of these interactions occurred with the catalytic amino acids (Pro193, Tyr158, Phe149, and Lys165). MD simulation showed that 5j possessed the highest binding affinity toward the enzyme, according to the two calculation methods (MM/PBSA and MM/GBSA). The single-crystal X-ray studies of compounds 5c and 5d revealed that the molecular arrangements in these two structures were mostly guided by C-H···O hydrogen-bonded dimeric motifs and C-H···N hydrogen bonds, while various secondary interactions (such as π···π and C-H···F) also contributed to crystal formation. Compounds 5a, 5c, 5i, and 5j exhibited no toxicity up to 500 μg/mL. In conclusion, 5i and 5j are promising anti-TB compounds that have shown high affinity based on docking and MD simulation results."
https://openalex.org/W2948935395,"Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) play critical roles in the stability and tonic regulation of vascular homeostasis. VSMCs can switch back and forth between highly proliferative synthetic and fully differentiated contractile phenotypes in response to changes in the vessel environment. Although abnormal phenotypic switching of VSMCs is a hallmark of vascular disorders such as atherosclerosis and restenosis after angioplasty, how control of VSMC phenotypic switching is dysregulated in pathologic conditions remains obscure. We found that inhibition of canonical transient receptor potential 6 (TRPC6) channels facilitated contractile differentiation of VSMCs through plasma membrane hyperpolarization. TRPC6-deficient VSMCs exhibited more polarized resting membrane potentials and higher protein kinase B (Akt) activity than wild-type VSMCs in response to TGF-β1 stimulation. Ischemic stress elicited by oxygen-glucose deprivation suppressed TGF-β1-induced hyperpolarization and VSMC differentiation, but this effect was abolished by TRPC6 deletion. TRPC6-mediated Ca2+ influx and depolarization coordinately promoted the interaction of TRPC6 with lipid phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome 10 (PTEN), a negative regulator of Akt activation. Given the marked up-regulation of TRPC6 observed in vascular disorders, our findings suggest that attenuation of TRPC6 channel activity in pathologic VSMCs could be a rational strategy to maintain vascular quality control by fine-tuning of VSMC phenotypic switching.—Numaga-Tomita, T., Shimauchi, T., Oda, S., Tanaka, T., Nishiyama, K., Nishimura, A., Birnbaumer, L., Mori, Y., Nishida, M.

Mapping the phospho-catalytic profile of kinases in cells or tissues remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a practical high-throughput system to measure the enzymatic activity of kinases using biological peptide targets as phospho-sensors to reveal kinase dependencies in tumour biopsies and cell lines. A 228-peptide screen was developed to detect the activity of >60 kinases, including ABLs, AKTs, CDKs and MAPKs. Focusing on BRAFV600E tumours, we found mechanisms of intrinsic resistance to BRAFV600E-targeted therapy in colorectal cancer, including targetable parallel activation of PDPK1 and PRKCA. Furthermore, mapping the phospho-catalytic signatures of melanoma specimens identifies RPS6KB1 and PIM1 as emerging druggable vulnerabilities predictive of poor outcome in BRAFV600E patients. The results show that therapeutic resistance can be caused by the concerted upregulation of interdependent pathways. Our kinase activity-mapping system is a versatile strategy that innovates the exploration of actionable kinases for precision medicine.

This study explores the role of mitochondrial dysfunction as an intramuscular signal for the extracellular matrix (ECM)-based proteolysis and, consequentially, muscle cell dystrophy. We found that inhibition of the mitochondrial electron transport chain causes paralysis as well as muscle structural damage in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. This was associated with a significant decline in collagen content. Both paralysis and muscle damage could be rescued with collagen IV overexpression, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), and Furin inhibitors in Antimycin A-treated animal as well as in the C. elegans Duchenne muscular dystrophy model. Additionally, muscle cytosolic calcium increased in the Antimycin A-treated worms, and its down-regulation rescued the muscle damage, suggesting that calcium overload acts as one of the early triggers and activates Furin and MMPs for collagen degradation. In conclusion, we have established ECM degradation as an important pathway of muscle damage.-Sudevan, S., Takiura, M., Kubota, Y., Higashitani, N., Cooke, M., Ellwood, R.

https://openalex.org/W2920991535,"The genetic determinants of bacterial pathogenicity are highly variable between species and strains. However, a factor that is commonly associated with virulent Gram-negative bacteria, including many Aeromonas spp., is the type 3 secretion system (T3SS), which is used to inject effector proteins into target eukaryotic cells. In this study, we developed a bioinformatics pipeline to identify T3SS effector proteins, applied this approach to the genomes of 105 Aeromonas strains isolated from environmental, mutualistic, or pathogenic contexts and evaluated the cytotoxicity of the identified effectors through their heterologous expression in yeast. The developed pipeline uses a two-step approach, where candidate Aeromonas gene families are initially selected using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) profile searches against the Virulence Factors DataBase (VFDB), followed by strict comparisons against positive and negative control datasets, greatly reducing the number of false positives. This approach identified 21 Aeromonas T3SS likely effector families, of which 8 represent known or characterized effectors, while the remaining 13 have not previously been described in Aeromonas. We experimentally validated our in silico findings by assessing the cytotoxicity of representative effectors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae BY4741, with 15 out of 21 assayed proteins eliciting a cytotoxic effect in yeast. The results of this study demonstrate the utility of our approach, combining a novel in silico search method with in vivo experimental validation, and will be useful in future research aimed at identifying and authenticating bacterial effector proteins from other genera."

In this article we present in vitro results of the efficacy of gentamicin released from a collagen sponge carrier against Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae biofilms preformed on hydroxyapatite surface. The results indicate that high local concentrations of gentamicin released from a sponge eradicate the biofilm formed not only by gentamicin-sensitive strains but, to some extent, also by those that display a resistance pattern in routine diagnostics. The data presented in this paper is of high clinical translational value and may find application in the treatment of bone infections."

The aim of this study was to determine whether binding of PDGF-BB to astrocytic PDGFRβ enhanced crosstalk among the various components of the neurovascular unit, leading to synaptic recovery after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The soluble PDGF-BB from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with SAH was measured. The relationship between PDGF-BB treatment and astrocytic PDGFRβ signaling was further explored in vivo and in vitro in experimental SAH models. Compared with the levels in the control samples, the PDGF-BB protein levels in the CSF of patients with SAH were significantly increased. After the generation of experimental SAH, astrocyte activation markers were markedly induced by the binding of PDGF-BB to astrocytic PDGFRβ, accompanied by improved levels of synaptic recovery and cognitive function. Soluble PDGF-BB and astrocytic PDGFRβ signaling are essential for the neuroprotective effect in the hippocampus and the coculture system in vitro after SAH that otherwise leads to cognitive dysfunction and neuronal damage.-Zhou, X., Wu, Q., Lu, Y., Zhang, X., Lv, S., Shao, J., Zhou, Y., Chen, J., Hou, L., Huang, C., Zhang, X.

https://openalex.org/W2948250977,"Activated microglia and increased brain IL-1β play a main role in cognitive impairment in much pathology. We studied the role of IL-1β in neuroinflammation-induced impairment of the following different types of learning and memory: novel object recognition (NOR), novel object location (NOL), spatial learning, reference memory (RM), and working memory (WM). All these processes are impaired in hyperammonemic rats. We assessed which of these types of learning and memory are restored by blocking the IL-1 receptor in vivo in hyperammonemic rats and the possible mechanisms involved. Blocking the IL-1 receptor reversed microglial activation in the hippocampus, perirhinal cortex, and prefrontal cortex but not in the postrhinal cortex. This was associated with the restoration of NOR and WM but not of tasks involving a spatial component (NOL and RM). This suggests that IL-1β would be involved in neuroinflammation-induced nonspatial memory impairment, whereas spatial memory impairment would be IL-1β–independent and would be mediated by other proinflammatory factors.—Taoro-González, L., Cabrera-Pastor, A., Sancho-Alonso, M., Arenas, Y.

https://openalex.org/W2948643182,"Elevenin is a newly discovered novel neuropeptide. Knockdown of either elevenin or orphan receptor NlA42 transcript expression by RNA interference caused severe cuticle melanization in the brown planthopper (BPH). Injection of a synthetic elevenin peptide not only rescued the body color phenotype in dselevenin-pretreated individuals but also suppressed melanization of black insects grown in natural conditions. Real-time quantitative PCR results revealed that elevenin expression levels were highest in the brain and salivary gland. Immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed that a precursor peptide of elevenin was generated in the salivary gland, suggesting that the salivary gland might be an important neurosecretory tissue in addition to the brain in BPH. Furthermore, double-strand RNA-mediated silencing of elevenin and NlA42 resulted in down-regulation of arylalkylamine-N-acetyltransferase and up-regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase, whereas elevenin peptide injection resulted in up-regulation of N-β-alanyldopamine synthase and aspartate 1-decarboxylase, indicating a complex regulation network for cuticle pigmentation. In addition, functional characterization demonstrated that NlA42 is a cognate receptor for elevenin, and couples to Gq and Gs proteins, triggering both PLC/Ca2+/PKC and AC/cAMP/PKA signaling pathways in response to elevenin treatment. These findings suggest that the elevenin signaling functions control BPH body color through the tyrosine-mediated cuticle melanism pathway.-Wang, S.-L., Wang, W.-W., Ma, Q., Shen, Z.-F., Zhang, M.-Q., Zhou, N.-M., Zhang, C.-X.

Together with ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 E1 (UBE2E1), TRIM21 acts both as an E3 ligase and as a substrate in autoubiquitination. We here report a 2.82-Å crystal structure of the human TRIM21 RING domain in complex with the human E2-conjugating UBE2E1 enzyme, in which a ubiquitin-targeted TRIM21 substrate lysine was captured in the UBE2E1 active site. The structure revealed that the direction of lysine entry is similar to that described for human proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO)-targeted substrate, and thus differs from the canonical SUMO-targeted substrate entry. In agreement, we found that critical UBE2E1 residues involved in the capture of the TRIM21 substrate lysine are conserved in ubiquitin-conjugating E2s, whereas residues critical for SUMOylation are not conserved. We noted that coordination of the acceptor lysine leads to remodeling of amino acid side-chain interactions between the UBE2E1 active site and the E2–E3 direct interface, including the so-called “linchpin” residue conserved in RING E3s and required for ubiquitination. The findings of our work support the notion that substrate lysine activation of an E2–E3-connecting allosteric path may trigger catalytic activity and contribute to the understanding of specific lysine targeting by ubiquitin-conjugating E2s.

There is a critical need to identify potential new viral pathogens and the challenge is to identify the reservoirs from which these viruses might emerge. Deep sequencing of invertebrate transcriptomes has revealed a plethora of viruses, many of which represent novel lineages representing both plant and animal viruses and little is known about the potential threat that these viruses pose.Providence virus, an insect virus, was used to establish a productive infection in Vigna unguiculata (cowpea) plants. Providence virus particles purified from these cowpea plants were used to infect two mammalian cell lines.Here, we present evidence that Providence virus, a non-enveloped insect RNA virus, isolated from a lepidopteran midgut cell line can establish a productive infection in plants as well as in animal cells. The observation that Providence virus can readily infect both plants and mammalian cell culture lines demonstrates the ability of an insect RNA virus to establish productive infections across two kingdoms, in plants and invertebrate and vertebrate animal cell lines.The study highlights the potential of phytophagous insects as reservoirs for viral re-assortment and that plants should be considered as reservoirs for emerging viruses that may be potentially pathogenic to humans."

Naltrexone is one of the rare TLR4 antagonists with good blood-brain barrier permeability and showing no stereoselectivity for TLR4. By linking 2 naltrexone units through a rigid pyrrole spacer, the bivalent ligand norbinaltorphimine was formed. Interestingly, (+)-norbinaltorphimine [(+)-1] showed ∼25 times better TLR4 antagonist activity than naltrexone in microglial BV-2 cell line, whereas (-)-norbinaltorphimine [(-)-1] lost TLR4 activity. The enantioselectivity of norbinaltorphimine was further confirmed in primary microglia, astrocytes, and macrophages. The activities of meso isomer of norbinaltorphimine and the molecular dynamic simulation results demonstrate that the stereochemistry of (+)-1 is derived from the (+)-naltrexone pharmacophore. Moreover, (+)-1 significantly increased and prolonged morphine analgesia in vivo. The efficacy of (+)-1 is long lasting.

https://openalex.org/W2948115897,"Estimating the tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) infection risk under substantial uncertainties of the vector abundance, environmental condition and human-tick interaction is important for evidence-informed public health intervention strategies. Estimating this risk is computationally challenging since the data we observe, i.e., the human incidence of TBE, is only the final outcome of the tick-host transmission and tick-human contact processes. The challenge also increases since the complex TBE virus (TBEV) transmission cycle involves the non-systemic route of transmission between co-feeding ticks. Here, we describe the hidden Markov transition process, using a novel TBEV transmission-human case reporting cascade model that couples the susceptible-infected compartmental model describing the TBEV transmission dynamics among ticks, animal hosts and humans, with the stochastic observation process of human TBE reporting given infection. By fitting human incidence data in Hungary to the transmission model, we estimate key parameters relevant to the tick-host interaction and tick-human transmission. We then use the parametrized cascade model to assess the transmission potential of TBEV in the enzootic cycle with respect to the climate change, and to evaluate the contribution of non-systemic transmission. We show that the TBEV transmission potential in the enzootic cycle has been increasing along with the increased temperature though the TBE human incidence has dropped since 1990s, emphasizing the importance of persistent public health interventions. By demonstrating that non-systemic transmission pathway is a significant factor in the transmission of TBEV in Hungary, we conclude that the risk of TBE infection will be highly underestimated if the non-systemic transmission route is neglected in the risk assessment."
https://openalex.org/W2948472109,"Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a gaseous signaling molecule, which modulates a wide range of mammalian physiological processes. Cystathionine γ-lyase (CSE) catalyzes H2S synthesis and is a potential target for modulating H2S levels under pathophysiological conditions. CSE is inhibited by propargylglycine (PPG), a widely used mechanism-based inhibitor. In this study, we report that inhibition of H2S synthesis from cysteine, but not the canonical cystathionine cleavage reaction catalyzed by CSE in vitro, is sensitive to preincubation of the enzyme with PPG. In contrast, the efficacy of S-3-carboxpropyl-l-cysteine (CPC) a new inhibitor described herein, was not dependent on the order of substrate/inhibitor addition. We observed that CPC inhibited the γ-elimination reaction of cystathionine and H2S synthesis from cysteine by human CSE with Ki values of 50 ± 3 and 180 ± 15 μm, respectively. We noted that CPC spared the other enzymes involved either directly (cystathionine β-synthase and mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase) or indirectly (cysteine aminotransferase) in H2S biogenesis. CPC also targeted CSE in cultured cells, inhibiting transsulfuration flux by 80–90%, as monitored by the transfer of radiolabel from [35S]methionine to GSH. The 2.5 Å resolution crystal structure of human CSE in complex with the CPC-derived aminoacrylate intermediate provided a structural framework for the molecular basis of its inhibitory effect. In summary, our study reveals a previously unknown confounding effect of PPG, widely used to inhibit CSE-dependent H2S synthesis, and reports on an alternative inhibitor, CPC, which could be used as a scaffold to develop more potent H2S biogenesis inhibitors."

Objective This retrospective study aims to describe the radiologic signs characterizing and identifying the shrinking vestibular schwannoma. Methods Involution was considered to have occurred if tumor size had decreased by 2 mm or more on its largest diameter. All magnetic resonance imaging scans were reviewed for tumor size, internal auditory meatus size, and tumor characteristics. Volumetric measurements were performed on the first and last scan. Audiometric data were collected at the first and last visit. Results Fourteen patients with a confirmed spontaneous regression were included, with a mean follow-up of 5 ± 2.6 years. The mean shrinkage rate was 0.9 ± 0.59 mm/year on 2D measurements, and 0.2 ± 0.17 cm3/year on volumetric measurements, with a relative shrinkage of 40 ± 16.9%. Two remarkable radiologic features were observed: First, a festooned aspect, defined by multiple curves in the tumor outline, noticed in 12 cases (86%); second, the appearance of cerebrospinal fluid filling the internal auditory meatus, associated with an enlargement of the internal auditory meatus compared to the contralateral side, and observed in 10 out of 13 cases with internal auditory meatus invasion (77%). Those two aspects were associated in 64% of cases. Conclusion These two newly reported radiologic features could help neurosurgeons, oto-neurosurgeons and neuroradiologists to identify a spontaneous vestibular schwannoma involution at first visit. This could allow any treatment to be postponed, monitoring to be more widely spaced, and patients to be reassured."

While still early in the process of reclamation, land undergoing reclamation offers an opportunity to study factors influencing reclamation success, as well as how reclaimed ecosystems function. As such, an Early Successional Wildlife Dynamics (ESWD) program was created to study how wildlife return to and use reclaimed upland boreal habitat in the AOSR. Wildlife data comprising 182 taxa of mammals, birds, and amphibians, collected between 2011 and 2017 and from five oil sands leases, were compared from multiple habitat types (burned [BRN], cleared [CLR], compensation lakes [COMP], logged [LOG], mature forest [MF], and reclaimed sites [REC]). Overall, similarity of wildlife communities in REC and MF plots varied greatly, even at 33 years since reclamation (31-62% with an average of 52%). However, an average community similarity of 52% so early in the successional process suggests that current reclamation efforts are progressing towards increased similarity compared to mature forest plots. Conversely, our data suggest that REC plots are recovering differently than plots impacted by natural (BRN) or other anthropogenic disturbances (LOG), which is likely due to differences associated with soil reconstruction and development on reclaimed plots. Regardless of the developmental trajectory of reclaimed habitats, progression towards increased wildlife community similarity at REC and MF plots is apparent in our data. While there is no expectation that reclaimed upland habitats will resemble or function identically to naturally occurring boreal forest, the degree of similarity observed in our study suggests that comparable ecological functionality is possible, increasing the probability that oil sands operators will be able to fulfill their regulatory requirements and duty to reclaim regarding wildlife and wildlife habitat."
https://openalex.org/W2948645060,"Fluoxetine (FLX), a widely used antidepressant primarily acting as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), has been shown to exhibit other mechanisms of action in various cell types. Consequently, it might have unexpected adverse effects not related to its intended use, possibly in the endocrine regulation of reproduction. We show in the present report that after a 1-hour preincubation of MLTC-1 Leydig cells with FLX, the intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) responses to Luteinizing Hormone (LH) and forskolin (FSK) are reduced through AMPK-dependent and -independent pathways respectively. FLX at low concentrations (12.5μM and 25μM) induced this inhibition without triggering AMPK phosphorylation, while higher FLX concentrations (50μM and 100μM) induced AMPK phosphorylation and lowered ATP concentration similarly to Metformin. Pretreatment with the specific AMPK inhibitor Compound C (CpdC), significantly diminished the inhibition of cAMP synthesis caused by high concentration of FLX. Moreover, as expected FLX also caused a decline of steroidogenesis which is under the control of cAMP. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the inhibition of cAMP synthesis by FLX is dose-dependent and occurs in MLTC-1 cells through two mechanisms, AMPK-independent and AMPK-dependent, at low and high concentrations, respectively. FLX also inhibited hormone-induced steroidogenesis in MLTC-1 cells and mouse testicular Leydig cells, suggesting similar mechanisms in both cell types."

This system is a phosphorelay-based regulatory system involved in sensing environmental Pi levels and induction of genes required for Pi acquisition under Pi-limiting conditions. Here we demonstrate that overexpression of the kinase domain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis PknB (PknB-KDMtb) inhibits the transcriptional activity of RegX3 of both M. tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis (RegX3Mtb and RegX3Ms, respectively). Mass spectrometry results, along with those of in vitro phosphorylation and complementation analyses, revealed that PknB kinase activity inhibits the transcriptional activity of RegX3Mtb through phosphorylation events at Thr-100, Thr-191, and Thr-217. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays disclosed that phosphorylation of Thr-191 and Thr-217 abolishes the DNA-binding ability of RegX3Mtb and that Thr-100 phosphorylation likely prevents RegX3Mtb from being activated through conformational changes induced by SenX3-mediated phosphorylation. We propose that the convergence of the PknB and SenX3-RegX3 signaling pathways might enable mycobacteria to integrate environmental Pi signals with the cellular replication state to adjust gene expression in response to Pi availability."
https://openalex.org/W2949003070,"Skeletal muscles contain heterogeneous myofibers that are different in size and contractile speed, with type IIb myofiber being the largest and fastest. Here, we identify methyltransferase-like 21e (Mettl21e), a member of newly classified nonhistone methyltransferases, as a gene enriched in type IIb myofibers. The expression of Mettl21e was strikingly up-regulated in hypertrophic muscles and during myogenic differentiation in vitro and in vivo. Knockdown (KD) of Mettl21e led to atrophy of cultured myotubes, and targeted mutation of Mettl21e in mice reduced the size of IIb myofibers without affecting the composition of myofiber types. Mass spectrometry and methyltransferase assay revealed that Mettl21e methylated valosin-containing protein (Vcp/p97), a key component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. KD or knockout of Mettl21e resulted in elevated 26S proteasome activity, and inhibition of proteasome activity prevented atrophy of Mettl21e KD myotubes. These results demonstrate that Mettl21e functions to maintain myofiber size through inhibiting proteasome-mediated protein degradation.-Wang, C., Zhang, B., Ratliff, A.

Parents adjust their parenting according to their child's temperament, however, few studies have accounted for parenting while estimating the association between temperament and academic outcomes. We examined the associations between temperament (2-3 years) and cognitive and academic outcomes (6-7 years) when mediation by parenting practices (4-5 years) was held constant, by estimating the controlled direct effect. Participants were from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (n = 5107). Cognitive abilities were measured by the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test (verbal) and the Matrix Reasoning test (non-verbal). Literacy and numeracy were reported by teachers using the Academic Rating Scale. Mothers reported children's temperament using the Short Temperament Scale for Toddlers (subscales: reactivity, approach, and persistence). Parenting practices included items about engagement in activities with children. Marginal structural models with inverse probability of treatment weights were used to estimate the controlled direct effect of temperament, when setting parenting to the mean. All temperament subscales were associated with cognitive abilities, with persistence showing the largest associations with verbal (PPVT; β = 0.58; 95%CI 0.27, 0.89) and non-verbal (Matrix Reasoning: β = 0.19; 0.02, 0.34) abilities. Higher persistence was associated with better literacy (β = 0.08; 0.03, 0.13) and numeracy (β = 0.08; 0.03, 0.13), and higher reactivity with lower literacy (β = -0.08; -0.11, -0.05) and numeracy (β = -0.07; -0.10, -0.04). There was little evidence that temperamental approach influenced literacy or numeracy.

https://openalex.org/W2948041227,"Underreporting of alcohol consumption is one of the major challenges in survey research including self-reports. The aim of this study was to test whether underreporting can be reduced by prompting respondents to first reflect on their drinking in the past week and then answer quantity-frequency based screening questions on their typical alcohol use. Data come from 2,379 adults (54% female; mean age = 31.8 years, SD = 11.4 years) consecutively recruited at a local registration office in northeastern Germany. Participants responded to an electronic, self-administered questionnaire on different health behaviors. They were randomized to receiving the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C) either before or after the assessment of past week timeline follow-back questions. Logistic regression models were calculated predicting positive screening results for at-risk drinking. Potential interaction effects with gender, age and educational background were explored. Results show that the assessment of past week alcohol consumption prior to the assessment of the AUDIT-C reduced the odds of obtaining positive screening results (OR = 0.83; 95% CI = 0.70-0.99). There were no interaction effects with gender, age and educational background. As a secondary finding, participants reported consistently lower alcohol consumption in the alcohol measure that was administered later in the questionnaire. Preceding questions about alcohol consumption in the past week reduced the probability of positive screening results for at-risk drinking. Our findings suggest that prompting people to recall past week alcohol use prior to screening may not be a solution to reduce underreporting."
https://openalex.org/W2948110491,"Objective Harmful levels of alcohol consumption in young people are prevalent and of increasing public concern in the western world. Rates of alcohol-related emergency hospital admissions in children and young people between 10 to 17 years were described, and the reasons for these admissions and their association with socio-demographic factors were examined. Methods E-cohort data were extracted from the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank, which contained alcohol-related emergency hospital admissions (N = 2968) from 2006 to 2011 in children and adolescents aged 10 to 17 years in Wales. A generalised linear mixed model was fitted using a log-link with a population offset to the data to calculate incident rate ratios (IRRSs). Results There was a general decreasing trend from 2006 to 2011 in the number and rate of alcohol-related emergency hospital admissions; the mean age of admission was 15.4 (standard deviation 1.4) years. In each of the four youngest age groups (10–13,14,15,16 years), females had higher IRRs than males. Males had slightly higher IRR compared to females only in the oldest age group (17 years). IRRs increased with increasing deprivation. The majority (92%) of the admissions lasted one day and most of the admissions (70%) occured during the last three days of the week with a peak on Saturday. The length of stay in hospital was longer in cases when self-harm were present. Multiple admissions showed high prevalance of serious self-harm cases in females. The number of admissions with injuries and falls were higher for males than females. Conclusion Female children and adolescents were more likely to be admitted to hospital for alcohol-related reasons. These data illustrate the significant burden of alcohol-related harm in young people and highlight the need for interventions and policies that promote safe drinking practices among young people to prevent future alcohol-related harm during the life-course."
https://openalex.org/W2948169749,"Natural genetic transformation via horizontal gene transfer enables rapid adaptation to dynamic environments and contributes to both antibiotic resistance and vaccine evasion among bacterial populations. In Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), transformation occurs when cells enter competence, a transient state in which cells express the competence master regulator, SigX (σX), an alternative σ factor (σ), and a competence co-regulator, ComW. Together, ComW and σX facilitate expression of the genes required for DNA uptake and genetic recombination. SigX activity depends on ComW, as ΔcomW cells transcribe late genes and transform at levels 10- and 10,000-fold below that of WT cells, respectively. Previous findings suggest that ComW functions during assembly of the RNA polymerase-σX holoenzyme to help promote transcription from σX-targeted promoters. However, it remains unknown how ComW facilitates holoenzyme assembly. As ComW seems to be unique to Gram-positive cocci and has no sequence similarity with known transcriptional activators, here we used Rosetta to generate an ab initio model of pneumococcal ComW's 3D-structure. Using this model as a basis for further biochemical, biophysical, and genetic investigations into the molecular features important for its function, we report that ComW is a predicted globular protein and that it interacts with DNA, independently of DNA sequence. We also identified conserved motifs in ComW and show that key residues in these motifs contribute to DNA binding. Lastly, we provide evidence that ComW's DNA-binding activity is important for transformation in pneumococcus. Our findings begin to fill the gaps in understanding how ComW regulates σX activity during bacterial natural transformation."
https://openalex.org/W2948260056,"Background We aimed to determine demographic and clinicopathological predictors for residual disease in women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2/3) with endocervical cone margin involvement. Methods and findings A cross-sectional study was conducted. The eligible patients were women who underwent hysterectomy as a treatment option after having a positive endocervical margin for CIN 2/3 in cervix conization specimens from 2000 to 2015. The patients were divided into two groups based on the persistence of CIN 2/3 and absence of CIN 2/3 in hysterectomy specimens. Demographic, clinical and histology information were collected in both groups. A total of 80 patients were eligible for the study; 37 (46.3%) had no persistence of CIN 2/3 and 43 (53.7%) had persistence of CIN 2/3 in the hysterectomy specimens. Demographic, clinical, and cone specimen characteristics, and a visible squamocolumnar junction and type of conization were analyzed as possible risk factors for the presence of residual lesions at hysterectomy, and none of these variables were associated with residual disease. Menopausal status was strongly associated with a high risk of persistent residual disease 81.2% (OR 4.9, CI 1.27–18.9), P = 0.014. In the multivariate analysis, only a menopausal status (P = 0.04) was associated with a high risk of persistent lesions. Conclusion This analysis found that menopausal status exhibited an important association with persistent residual disease. Menopausal women with endocervical margin involvement exhibit a greater than 80% risk of persistent lesions."
https://openalex.org/W2948176885,"Background In recent years, researchers have begun to explore the implications of shyness for the psychosocial wellbeing of children and adolescents, exploring its association with internalizing problems. Research in an Italian context is hindered by the lack of a validated self-report measure of shyness. We report two studies aimed to assess the psychometric properties of an Italian translation of the Children’s Shyness Questionnaire (CSQ-it) and investigate its correlations with convergent and divergent constructs. The first study aimed to examine associations between CSQ-it and self-report measures of anxiety and somatic symptoms and attachment with parents and peers. The second study aimed to investigate its relations to internet addiction. Methods The self-report measures were completed by 550 participants in the first study and 131 participants in the second study. Parents provided information on their child’s problems. Psychometric properties were assessed by Cronbach’s alpha in both studies and by exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis in Study 1. The relations between shyness and measures of internalizing problems and attachments were analyzed by correlational methods. In Study 2 a moderated mediation model tested the hypothesis that the relationship between shyness and internet addiction is mediated by somatic symptoms and that shyness moderates the relationship between somatic symptoms and internet addiction. Results The reliability and validity of the Italian Version of the Children’s Shyness Questionnaire were satisfactory. Results from confirmatory factor analyses confirmed the single-factor model of the questionnaire previously identified in North American and Chinese studies. There were significant correlations between shyness, anxious and somatic symptomatology, impaired psychosocial functioning and specific components of attachment relationships. In Study 2 the indirect effect of shyness on internet addiction through somatic symptoms was significant as well as significantly moderated for high shyness scores but not for low levels of shyness. Conclusion To our knowledge this is the first study that explored the psychometric proprieties of the Children’s Shyness Questionnaire in the Italian context. Findings demonstrated that this self-reported measure of shyness has sound psychometric properties and can be used as a sensitive and appropriate instrument for the assessment of shyness in children and adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W2948663331,"The Mongolian Gobi-Eastern Steppe Ecosystem is one of the largest remaining natural drylands and home to a unique assemblage of migratory ungulates. Connectivity and integrity of this ecosystem are at risk if increasing human activities are not carefully planned and regulated. The Gobi part supports the largest remaining population of the Asiatic wild ass (Equus hemionus; locally called “khulan”). Individual khulan roam over areas of thousands of square kilometers and the scale of their movements is among the largest described for terrestrial mammals, making them particularly difficult to monitor. Although GPS satellite telemetry makes it possible to track animals in near-real time and remote sensing provides environmental data at the landscape scale, remotely collected data also harbors the risk of missing important abiotic or biotic environmental variables or life history events. We tested the potential of animal born camera systems (“camera collars”) to improve our understanding of the drivers and limitations of khulan movements. Deployment of a camera collar on an adult khulan mare resulted in 7,881 images over a one-year period. Over half of the images showed other khulan and 1,630 images showed enough of the collared khulan to classify the behaviour of the animals seen into several main categories. These khulan images provided us with: i) new insights into important life history events and grouping dynamics, ii) allowed us to calculate time budgets for many more animals than the collared khulan alone, and iii) provided us with a training dataset for calibrating data from accelerometer and tilt sensors in the collar. The images also allowed to document khulan behaviour near infrastructure and to obtain a day-time encounter rate between a specific khulan with semi-nomadic herders and their livestock. Lastly, the images allowed us to ground truth the availability of water by: i) confirming waterpoints predicted from other analyses, ii) detecting new waterpoints, and iii) compare precipitation records for rain and snow from landscape scale climate products with those documented by the camera collar. We discuss the added value of deploying camera collars on a subset of animals in remote, highly variable ecosystems for research and conservation."

They cause respiratory and neurological disease in infected animals and can cause severe disease outbreaks. Isolates from this genus can be divided into four genogroups–A, B, and C, as well as a more distantly related sister group, “tortoise”. Sequences from large portions (5.3 kb) of the genomes of a variety of ferlavirus isolates from genogroups A, B, and C, including the genes coding the surface glycoproteins F and HN as well as the L protein were determined and compared. In silico analyses of the glycoproteins of genogroup A, B, and C isolates were carried out. Three isolates representing these three genogroups were used in transmission studies with corn snakes (Pantherophis guttatus), and clinical signs, gross and histopathology, electronmicroscopic changes in the lungs, and isolation of bacteria from the lungs were evaluated. Analysis of the sequences supported the previous categorization of ferlaviruses into four genogroups, and criteria for definition of ferlavirus genogroups and species were established based on sequence identities (80% resp. 90%). Analysis of the ferlavirus glycoprotein models showed parallels to corresponding regions of other paramyxoviruses. The transmission studies showed clear differences in the pathogenicities of the three virus isolates used. The genogroup B isolate was the most and the group A virus the least pathogenic. Reasons for these differences were not clear based on the differences in the putative structures of their respective glycoproteins, although e.g. residue and consequential structure variation of an extended cleavage site or changes in electrostatic charges at enzyme binding sites could play a role. The presence of bacteria in the lungs of the infected animals also clearly corresponded to increased pathogenicity. This study contributes to knowledge about the structure and phylogeny of ferlaviruses and lucidly demonstrates differences in pathogenicity between strains of different genogroups."

A polymorphism upstream of KCNE2 is associated with reduced lung function in human populations, but the pulmonary consequences of KCNE2 gene disruption are unknown. Here, germline deletion of mouse Kcne2 reduced pulmonary expression of potassium channel α subunits Kcnq1 and Kcnb1 but did not alter expression of other Kcne genes. Kcne2 colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated with Kcnq1 in mouse lungs, suggesting the formation of pulmonary Kcnq1-Kcne2 potassium channel complexes. Kcne2 deletion reduced blood O2, increased CO2, increased pulmonary apoptosis, and increased inflammatory mediators TNF-α, IL-6, and leukocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids. Consistent with increased pulmonary vascular leakage, Kcne2 deletion increased plasma, BAL albumin, and the BAL:plasma albumin concentration ratio. Kcne2−/− mouse lungs exhibited baseline induction of the reperfusion injury salvage kinase pathway but were less able to respond via this pathway to imposed pulmonary ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI). We conclude that KCNE2 regulates KCNQ1 in the lungs and is required for normal lung function and resistance to pulmonary IRI. Our data support a causal relationship between KCNE2 gene disruption and lung dysfunction.—Zhou, L., Köhncke, C., Hu, Z., Roepke, T. K., Abbott, G. W.

https://openalex.org/W2948366409,"Tick-borne encephalitis infections have increased the last 30 years. The mortality associated to this viral infection is 0.5 to 30% with a risk of permanent neurological sequelae, however, no therapeutic is currently available. The first steps of virus-cell interaction, such as attachment and entry, are of importance to understand pathogenesis and tropism. Several molecules have been shown to interact with tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) at the plasma membrane surface, yet, no studies have proven that these are specific entry receptors. In this study, we set out to characterize the cellular attachment receptor(s) for TBEV using the naturally attenuated member of the TBEV complex, Langat virus (LGTV), as a model. Inhibiting or cleaving different molecules from the surface of A549 cells, combined with inhibition assays using peptide extracts from high LGTV binding cells, revealed that LGTV attachment to host cells is dependent on plasma membrane proteins, but not on glycans or glycolipids, and suggested that LGTV might use different cellular attachment factors on different cell types. Based on this, we developed a transcriptomic approach to generate a list of candidate attachment and entry receptors. Our findings shed light on the first step of the flavivirus life-cycle and provide candidate receptors that might serve as a starting point for future functional studies to identify the specific attachment and/or entry receptor for LGTV and TBEV."
https://openalex.org/W2948466335,"One of the challenges encountered by the protein quality control machinery is the need to ensure that members of multiprotein complexes are available in the correct proportions. In this study, we demonstrate that the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) mediates the degradation of Apc11, the catalytic core subunit of the anaphase promoting complex/cyclosome (APC/C). In vitro studies have shown that Apc11, together with its E2 enzyme, is sufficient to ubiquitinate substrates independently of the APC/C. Here, we establish that this can occur in living yeast cells. We show that the tight controls regulating the function of the fully assembled APC/C can be circumvented when its substrates are ubiquitinated by the excess levels of Apc11 independently of the assembled complex. We thus suggest that the UPS-mediated degradation of Apc11 is an overlooked mechanism ensuring that proper function of the APC/C is limited to suitably delimited holoenzymes and that an imbalance in protein expression may result in detrimental gain-of-function activity, rather than merely the disruption of protein complex stoichiometry.—Volpe, M., Levinton, N., Rosenstein, N., Prag, G., Ben-Aroya, S.

Ozeir et al. now employ a complementary biochemical, structural, and computational approach to deduce the chemical constraints governing binding and propose a distinct mechanism for catalysis in one of these enzymes, adenine phosphoribosyltransferase.

Full-Text PDF Open Access Purines are nitrogenous bases indispensable for living organisms. They play important roles in energy transfer, genetic information storage, and signal transduction. Purine metabolism is an essential pathway that has been conserved through evolution from prokaryotes to eukaryotes. Purines can be synthesized de novo or through salvage pathways by specific enzymes. Two such enzymes in the salvage pathway are adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT, EC 2.4.2.7) 4The abbreviations used are: APRTadenine phosphoribosyltransferaseADEadeninebuffer A20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2DSFdifferential scanning fluorimetryGuaguanineHGPRThypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferaseHxhypoxanthineNCInoncovalent interactionPRPPα-d-5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphateQM/MMquantum mechanics/molecular mechanicsRMSDroot mean square deviationSNnucleophilic substitution. and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT, EC 2.4.2.8). These are enzymes with reversible activities having an ordered sequential bi-bi reaction mechanism (1Bashor C. Denu J.M. Brennan R.G. Ullman B. Kinetic mechanism of adenine phosphoribosyltransferase from Leishmania donovani.Biochemistry. 2002; 41 (11900545): 4020-403110.1021/bi0158730Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 2Yuan L.

In the forward reaction, APRT synthesizes AMP from adenine (ADE) (Fig. 1), whereas HGPRT generates GMP or IMP from guanine (Gua) or hypoxanthine (Hx), respectively. Both reactions use the co-substrate α-d-5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) and at least one divalent magnesium ion. In the reverse pathway, PPi and the corresponding ribonucleoside monophosphate are substrates of the reaction (8Heinonen J.K. Biological Role of Inorganic Pyrophosphate. Springer US, New York200110.1007/978-1-4615-1433-6Crossref Google Scholar). Similarly to other phosphoribosyltransferase enzymes, both APRT and HGPRT structures are made of a Rossmann fold. They also include a PRPP-binding motif, a flexible loop, and a hood region (Fig. S1). The last seems to provide purine specificity, either ADE or Hx and Gua, in APRT or HGPRT, respectively (3Eads J.C. Scapin G. Xu Y. Grubmeyer C. Sacchettini J.C.

The intracellular concentrations of adenine, hypoxanthine, and guanine are in the order of 1 μm, 10 μm, and 0.5 μm, respectively (7Curto R. Voit E.O. Sorribas A. Cascante M. Validation and steady-state analysis of a power-law model of purine metabolism in man.Biochem. J. 1997; 324 (9210399): 761-77510.1042/bj3240761Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For the associated mononucleotides, AMP, IMP, and GMP, the intracellular concentrations are estimated to be 200 μm, 100 μm, and 25 μm (7Curto R. Voit E.O. Sorribas A. Cascante M. Validation and steady-state analysis of a power-law model of purine metabolism in man.Biochem. J. 1997; 324 (9210399): 761-77510.1042/bj3240761Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). For APRT, ADE and AMP concentrations in cells are therefore similar to those of other potential substrates present in the cell such as hypoxanthine, guanine, IMP, and GMP. The same is true for the HGPRT substrates. How does hAPRT thus discriminate among these molecules and achieve its specificity? For example, although Hx and ADE have the same chemical skeleton, which differs only by a hydroxyl instead of an amine at the C6 position away from the reactive N9 nitrogen, ADE seems to be the only purine metabolized by hAPRT. Furthermore, in the reverse reaction, how does hAPRT discriminate among AMP, IMP, and GMP, because these substrates have identical glycosidic bonds where the reaction takes place? In addition, the reaction mechanism in HGPRT has been well-described, and it follows an SN1-type reaction (unimolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction) which involves an oxocarbenium transition compound (9Goitein R.K.

Our objectives were first to define the bidirectional molecular selectivity of hAPRT with respect to the potential substrates present in cells, and second to determine the molecular mechanism of hAPRT to discriminate between SN1- and SN2-type reactions. Four crystallographic structures of human APRT in complex with either phosphate ion, Hx-PRPP-Mg2+, IMP, or GMP were obtained. Our results, compared with our recent ADE-PRPP-Mg2+-, AMP-, and AMP-PPi-Mg2+-hAPRT structures (6Huyet J. Ozeir M. Burgevin M.-C. Pinson B. Chesney F. Remy J.-M. Siddiqi A.R. Lupoli R. Pinon G.

We first used differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) to explore the ligand-binding properties of hAPRT (Table 1). As observed previously (6Huyet J. Ozeir M. Burgevin M.-C. Pinson B. Chesney F.

To investigate the destabilizing effect because of the removal of PRPP from the enzyme in the reverse reaction, we solved the crystal structure of the substrate-free hAPRT to 1.70 Å resolution (Table 2). To obtain this structure, we left the very unstable PRPP molecules to naturally hydrolyze within PRPP-Mg2+-hAPRT crystal for 1 month. The structure showed a typical Rossmann fold where a central stranded twisted parallel β-sheet (β3-β4-β7-β8-β9) is sandwiched between α-helices (Fig. 2A). The conserved residues over prokaryotes and eukaryotes are all close to the active site except for the flexible loop residues (Figs. S1 and S2). The substrate-free structure showed no difference when superimposed to the PRPP-Mg2+–bound structure, with an RMSD (root mean square deviation) of 0.20 Å (Fig. 2B). However, part of the flexible loop (amino acids 103–106) was missing in both subunits. After PRPP hydrolysis, a phosphate ion, identified by a clear electron density (Fig. 2C and Note S1), remains in the active site and interacts with the conserved Ala-131–TGGT–PRPP–binding motif (Figs. 2C and S1). A network of water molecules replaced the ribose and pyrophosphate moieties and interacts with the conserved Arg-67, Asp-127, Asp-128, Ala-131 and Gly-133 residues (Fig. 2C).Table 1Ligand-binding analysis by differential scanning fluorimetryProtein complexUnfolding temperature (Tm) in °CReferenceshAPRT49.6 ± 1.26Huyet J.

Open table in a new tab Five of these water molecules (called a, b, c, d, e) were located in close vicinity of the six oxygen atoms coordinating the magnesium ion in the PRPP-Mg2+-hAPRT structures (PDB IDs: 6FCH, 6FCI, and 6FD4) (Fig. 2D). In addition, the phosphate group in the substrate-free hAPRT structure interacted in a similar way compared with the 5′-phosphate group of PRPP (Fig. 2D). These observations suggest that the substrate-free enzyme is destabilized by the formation of a water molecule network in the active site and a more dynamic flexible loop. Next, we addressed the substrate specificity of hAPRT using other purines than adenine, which are found at similar concentrations in cells. First, we co-crystallized hAPRT with guanine, PRPP, and magnesium. Although PRPP and magnesium were perfectly identified in the complex structure, we were unable to detect guanine in the active site. Second, we used Hx, a molecule identical in shape to ADE but with a hydroxyl or a keto group in place of a primary amine (Fig. 1B). With DSF analysis, we found no difference in the unfolding temperature when adenine or hypoxanthine were added to the PRPP-Mg2+-hAPRT complex (Table 1). Using a spectroscopy assay with PRPP and Hx as substrates, we did not detect a significant amount of IMP product up to a 75 μm Hx concentration (Fig. 3A). In addition, we did not observe any inhibition by Hx while using ADE and PRPP as substrates (Fig. 3A). Nonreactivity of hAPRT toward Hx could relate to Hx chemical properties or unbinding of Hx to the active site. In both cases, Hx may not be able to induce the structural modifications of hAPRT necessary to form the active conformation, as observed in our ADE-PRPP-Mg2+-hAPRT structure where the hood and the flexible loop undergo major changes upon ADE binding (6Huyet J.

To understand the nonreactivity of Hx, we determined the structure of hAPRT crystallized in the presence of PRPP, magnesium ion and hypoxanthine at 1.90 Å resolution (Table 2). We observed, as for ADE, that both the hood and the flexible loop regions cap the active site where Hx is bound (Fig. 3B). The structure of the Hx-PRPP-Mg2+-hAPRT complex was identical to that of the ADE-PRPP-Mg2+-hAPRT complex (PDB ID: 6FCI) with a RMSD of 0.15 Å, with the active sites superimposing perfectly. The Fo − Fc omit density map contoured at 3σ for Hx is shown in Fig. 3C. The poorer definition of the Hx purine ring in the electron density identified in all four molecules of the asymmetric unit, as compared with the electron density of the ADE, reflects a less stable conformation or a lower affinity for the site. However, the Fo − Fc omit map densities for PRPP showed full occupancy for this substrate (Fig. 3D) (Note S1). Hx can exist in a tautomeric equilibrium with either a hydroxyl or a keto group on C6, the latter being, by far, the most stable form in solution (14Costas M.E. Acevedo-Chávez R. Density functional study of the neutral hypoxanthine tautomeric forms.J. Phys. Chem. A. 1997; 101: 8309-831810.1021/jp970621nCrossref Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In the binding site, Hx interacts through hydrogen bonds with Arg-27, Arg-67, and Glu-104 (Fig. 3C). The interactions with Arg-27 and Arg-67 are crucial because their bonding atoms are both hydrogen donors; thus, N1 and N3 (Fig. 1) will act as hydrogen acceptors and this promotes a hydroxyl function at the C6 position. This hydroxyl group interacts on one side with the Glu-104 carboxylate side chain with an average distance of 2.9 Å over the four subunits of the asymmetric unit. On the other side, it is 3.2 Å away from the Val-25 carbonyl. This is not a favorable configuration and it may contribute to a destabilizing effect of Hx. Overall, the data show that, in the absence of ADE, a molecule like hypoxanthine, with an adenine shape, is able to bind to hAPRT and generate a full active site with both the hood and the flexible loop in place. However, the chemical properties of Hx appear to prevent the forward reaction to occur. We next tried to understand why among the nucleoside monophosphates, AMP is the sole substrate metabolized by hAPRT in the reverse reaction. To this end, we measured the stability of hAPRT by DSF in the presence of PPi, AMP, IMP, and GMP. We observed that PPi increased the stability of hAPRT (the Tm increased by 2.5 °C as compared with a 9.4 °C increase with AMP) (Table 1). Combined, the two substrates (PPi and AMP) potentiated the stabilization of the enzyme (Tm of 64.3 °C with ΔTm = 14.7 °C). Stabilization of the enzyme was also observed with IMP and GMP, although to a lesser extent. The Tm increased only 2–3 °C with the addition of IMP or GMP to the enzyme as compared with substrate-free hAPRT. Moreover, addition of PPi with IMP or GMP to the enzyme did not increase the Tm values. Therefore, the complexation of IMP and GMP to hAPRT seems less favorable than with AMP, and PPi may not contribute to the binding. To probe how IMP or GMP interact with hAPRT, we determined the crystal structures of the two complexes, IMP-hAPRT and GMP-hAPRT (Table 2). We diffused the IMP and GMP molecules into substrate-free hAPRT crystals and elucidated the structures to a better than 1.6 Å resolution. The structures were then compared with the natural AMP-hAPRT complex (PDB ID: 6FCL). The electron densities in the active sites were readily attributable to IMP and GMP (Fig. 4, A and B). Both structures were similar overall and superimposable to the substrate-free, PRPP-bound hAPRT or AMP-hAPRT structures with an RMSD between 0.17 and 0.31 Å. The conformation of IMP was, however, different from that of AMP (Fig. 4A and Fig. S3). Even though the interactions with the phosphate and the sugar moieties were conserved, the base was differently positioned. Specifically, with AMP, the N1 atom faces the main chain NH group of Arg-27 and presents its lone electron pair to form a hydrogen bond of 3.0 Å (Fig. S3). In the IMP complex, the N1 atom is at a hydrogen bond distance of 2.8 Å from the carboxyl group of Arg-27 (Fig. 4A). Therefore, N1 is likely to be protonated in this configuration. This implies that the oxygen atom on C6 should be in the more stable keto tautomer configuration and not in the hydroxyl one as observed in the Hx-hAPRT complex. The consequence of these modifications is a movement of the purine core, which culminates in a 1.4 Å displacement of the N1 and C2 atoms as compared with the AMP-hAPRT structure (Fig. 4C). This movement promotes a change in the orientation of the guanidinium moiety of Arg-67. Its CZ carbon atom would now be in close contact (2.4 Å) with a pyrophosphate substrate (PPi) involved in the reverse reaction, which we modeled based on the PRPP-Mg2+-hAPRT structure (Fig. 4C). Such configuration should preclude PPi from binding and, consequently, the reverse reaction would be forbidden with IMP in the active site. In addition, if IMP were a substrate, the formation of Hx would be concomitant with a change in the hydrogen bond network. Five hydrogen bonds would need to be broken between IMP and hAPRT, and four new ones would have to be formed after the displacement of the purine moiety (Fig. 3C). This is not energetically favorable for the enzyme and, together with the Arg-67 movement, would preclude the reverse reaction to occur. With GMP, we found that the GMP-hAPRT complex superimposed with that of the IMP complex with an RMSD of 0.2 Å (Fig. 4C, green and cyan). One difference comes from the extra amino group in GMP at the C2 position, which makes an additional hydrogen bond to the Arg-27 carbonyl and the Asp-128 carboxylate groups (Fig. 4B). Hence, the hood region backbone of hAPRT is critical for substrate specificity, which allows only AMP as the sole substrate for the reverse reaction. We also noticed that in both IMP and GMP molecules, the sugar puckering adopts a 4′ endo configuration as compared with a 3′ exo configuration in the AMP structure. Finally, in all three nucleotide structures, the flexible loop is in an open conformation but not well-defined from amino acid Ser-100 to Lys-107. The nucleotides make almost no contact with the loop and therefore do not contribute to its stabilization (Fig. 4D). The forward reaction catalyzed by hAPRT can occur via either an SN1 or an SN2 displacement mechanism (12Phillips C.L. Ullman B. Brennan R.G. Hill C.P.

According to an SN1-type reaction mechanism, an oxocarbenium intermediate must exist and be located on the C1′-O4′ atoms of PRPP. It is a short-lived, solvent-sensitive intermediate that can be stabilized by an electron donor moiety (16Chen X.Y. Link T.M. Schramm V.L.

https://openalex.org/W2948103159,"To assess the current hepatitis A virus (HAV) endemicity in the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina, Serbia, we examined the seroprevalence and susceptibility profiles of the general population. A serum bank of 3466 residual samples, collected in 2015-16 as per the specifications of the European Sero-Epidemiology Network 2 project (ESEN2), was tested for anti-HAV antibodies with an enzyme immunoassay. Relationships between anti-HAV positivity and demographic features of respondents were examined by univariable and multivariable analyses. Present-day HAV seroprevalence was compared with that obtained in 1978-79. Surveillance data for hepatitis A recorded between 2008 and 2017 were also analyzed. Age was the only demographic variable found to be independently associated with a HAV seropositive status. Seropositivity (17% overall vs. 79% in 1978-79) increased with age to a maximum of 90% in the elderly ≥60 years. Only 5% of subjects <30 years were seropositive, unlike the 44% of seropositives ≥30 years. The estimated age at midpoint of population immunity (AMPI) increased markedly from 14 years in the late 70s to 55 years in 2015-16. Meanwhile, disease incidence decreased noticeably in recent years (from 11 in 2008 to 2 per 100,000 population in 2017). In the ongoing pre-vaccine era, natural infection provides immunity for merely a third (31%) and two thirds (57%) of people in their 40s and 50s, respectively. Hence, the majority of people ≤40 years (94%) and middle-aged adults 40-49 years (69%) are susceptible to HAV. Older susceptible individuals, particularly those ≥50 years (24%), are prone to severe symptoms. Taken together, these changes reflect the epidemiological transition of Vojvodina and Serbia from high to very low HAV endemicity, thereby supporting the current national policy of immunization of only high-risk groups."
