Cytochrome oxidase undergoes a decrease in V max during hypoxia, which could alter mitochondrial redox and increase generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). We therefore tested whether ROS generated by mitochondria act as second messengers in the signaling pathway linking the detection of O2 with the functional response. Contracting cardiomyocytes were superfused under controlled O2 conditions while fluorescence imaging of 2,7-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) was used to assess ROS generation. Compared with normoxia (PO2 ∼ 107 torr, 15% O2), graded increases in DCF fluorescence were seen during hypoxia, with responses at PO2 = 7 torr > 20 torr > 35 torr. The antioxidants 2-mercaptopropionyl glycine and 1,10-phenanthroline attenuated these increases and abolished the inhibition of contraction. Superfusion of normoxic cells with H2O2 (25 μm) for >60 min mimicked the effects of hypoxia by eliciting decreases in contraction that were reversible after washout of H2O2. To test the role of cytochrome oxidase, sodium azide (0.75–2 μm) was added during normoxia to reduce theV max of the enzyme. Azide produced graded increases in ROS signaling, accompanied by graded decreases in contraction that were reversible. These results demonstrate that mitochondria respond to graded hypoxia by increasing the generation of ROS and suggest that cytochrome oxidase may contribute to this O2 sensing.

Alterations in oxygen tension (PO2) elicit a variety of functional responses in different cell types, including gene expression, altered metabolic function, altered ion channel activation, and release of neurotransmitters (1Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). In spontaneously contracting embryonic cardiomyocytes, we previously found significant decreases in contractile activity during prolonged moderate hypoxia (PO2 = 20 torr for >2 h) (2Budinger G.R.S. Chandel N. Shao Z.H. Li C.Q. Melmed A. Becker L.B. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 14: L37-L53Google Scholar). This inhibition was not associated with a depletion of ATP or phosphocreatine stores, and was reversible when normoxic conditions were restored. Similar findings of decreased contractile function during hypoxia (48 h at 1% O2) have also been seen in rat cardiac myocytes (3Silverman H.S. Wei S. Haigney M.C.P. Ocampo C.J. Stern M.D. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 699-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), which suggests that this response is not unique to embryonic cells. An ability to respond to changes in oxygen tension within the physiological range implies the existence of a cellular O2sensor linked to a signal transduction pathway. When activated by hypoxia, the sensor presumably would initiate a signaling cascade which ultimately leads to the functional response (e.g. diminished contractile activity). However, the O2 sensing mechanism and the subsequent signal transduction pathways involved in the cardiomyocyte responses to hypoxia are not known. A number of different potential mechanisms of cellular O2 sensing have been identified (1Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar). Mitochondria are responsible for most of the O2 consumption by the cell and would seem to be well suited because their localPO2 responds to changes in the ratio of O2 supply to demand. However, the low apparentK m of cytochrome oxidase for O2 (4Cooper C.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1017: 187-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 5Einarsdóttir O. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1229: 129-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 6Chance B. Williams G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1955; 217: 383-393Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) would appear to render these organelles incapable of detecting changes until very low O2 concentrations are reached. Nevertheless, our studies of hypoxic cardiomyocytes (2Budinger G.R.S. Chandel N. Shao Z.H. Li C.Q. Melmed A. Becker L.B. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 14: L37-L53Google Scholar) and of normal rat hepatocytes (7Chandel N. Budinger G.R.S. Kemp R.A. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: L918-L925Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Schumacker P.T. Chandel N. Agusti A.G.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: L395-L402PubMed Google Scholar) have implicated mitochondria as a likely site of O2sensing underlying their metabolic and functional responses to hypoxia. In this regard, we found that cytochrome oxidase undergoes a ∼50% decrease in V max during exposure to prolonged moderate hypoxia (9Chandel N.S. Budinger G.R.S. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18672-18677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). This change was manifested by decreases inN,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine-ascorbate respiration during hypoxia (2Budinger G.R.S. Chandel N. Shao Z.H. Li C.Q. Melmed A. Becker L.B. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 14: L37-L53Google Scholar), and also by increases in [NAD(P)H] autofluorescence (10Chandel N.S. Budinger G.R.S. Choe S.H. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18808-18816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Collectively, these findings cast a new light on the possible role of mitochondria in the cellular responses to hypoxia in cardiomyocytes. The presence of a cellular O2 sensor implies the existence of a signaling pathway linking it to the targeted response. If mitochondria function as that sensor, what signaling system could be activated by a decrease in the V max of cytochrome oxidase? We hypothesized that a decrease inV max of the oxidase should increase the reduction state of mitochondrial electron carriers upstream of cytochrome aa 3. This should increase the lifetime of reduced electron carriers such as ubisemiquinone, which would increase the generation of superoxide via univalent electron transfer to O2 in the mitochondria (11Turrens J.F. Alexandre A. Lehninger A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 237: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). Trace levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; DCF, 2,7-dichlorofluorescein; DCFH, reduced DCF; TTFA, thenoyltrifluoroacetone. 1The abbreviations used are: ROS, reactive oxygen species; DCF, 2,7-dichlorofluorescein; DCFH, reduced DCF; TTFA, thenoyltrifluoroacetone. such as superoxide or H2O2 could then potentially act as signaling elements by activating subsequent steps in a signal transduction cascade. Indeed, numerous studies have implicated ROS as participants in a variety of intracellular signaling sequences including members of the stress- and mitogen-activated protein kinases (12Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar, 13Laderoute K.R. Webster K.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar), the nuclear transcription factors c-Jun and NF-κB (14Flohe L. Brigelius-Flohe R. Saliou C. Traber M.G. Packer L. Free Radical. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 1115-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar), and other signaling systems (15Lander H.M. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (820) Google Scholar). The mechanisms responsible for intracellular oxidant generation involved in the activation of those pathways are not fully clear, but could involve mitochondrial sources during hypoxia. The present study therefore sought to test the hypothesis that ROS are generated by mitochondria during hypoxia in cardiomyocytes, and that ROS signaling is involved in coupling the O2 sensor to the contractile response to hypoxia. Embryonic chick cardiomyocytes were isolated using a method (2Budinger G.R.S. Chandel N. Shao Z.H. Li C.Q. Melmed A. Becker L.B. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 14: L37-L53Google Scholar) modified from Barry et al. (16Barry W.H. Pober J. Marsh J.D. Frankel S.R. Smith T.W. Am. J. Physiol. 1980; 239: H651-H657PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, hearts of 10–11-day-old chick embryos were removed and placed in Hank's balanced salt solution lacking magnesium and calcium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Ventricular tissue was minced and the cells were dissociated using four to six cycles of trypsin (0.025%, Life Technologies, Inc.) degradation at 37 °C with gentle agitation. Trypsin digestion was halted after 8 min by transferring the cells to a trypsin inhibitor solution. After filtering (100-μm mesh), the cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 1200 rpm at 4 °C and resuspended in nutritive medium. Cells then were placed in a Petri dish in a humidified incubator (5% CO2, 95% air at 37 °C) for 45 min to promote early adherence of fibroblasts. Nonadherent cells then were counted with a hemacytometer, and their viability was measured using trypan blue (0.4%). Approximately 1 × 106cells in nutritive medium (54% Barry's solution (in mm: NaCl (116), KCl (1.3), NaHCO3 (22Petersen L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 460: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), MgSO4(0.8), NaH2PO4 (1.0), CaCl2 (0.87), glucose (5.6)), 40% M199 with Earle's salts (Life Technologies, Inc.), 6% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 units/ml), and streptomycin (100 mg/ml)) were plated onto glass coverslips (25 mm). Cell yield averaged 5–6 × 105cells per embryo. Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator for 2–3 days, at which point synchronous contractions of the monolayer were noted. Experiments were performed on spontaneously contracting cells at day 3 or 4 after isolation. Rat hepatocytes were isolated using the methodology described previously (8Schumacker P.T. Chandel N. Agusti A.G.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: L395-L402PubMed Google Scholar). Spontaneously contracting myocytes on glass coverslips were placed in a stainless steel flow-through chamber (1-ml volume, Penn Century Co., Philadelphia). The chamber was sealed using thin-wafer gaskets to minimize any O2 exchange between the chamber wall and the perfusate, and mounted on a heated (37 °C) platform (Warner Instruments) on an inverted microscope. A water-jacketed glass equilibration column (37 °C) mounted above the microscope stage was used to equilibrate the perfusate to known O2 tensions (PO2). The perfusate consisted of a buffered salt solution (BSS) (in mm: NaCl (117), KCl (4.0), NaHCO3 (18Lo L.W. Koch C.J. Wilson D.F. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), MgSO4 (0.8), NaH2PO4 (1.0), CaCl2 (1.21), glucose (5.6)). The gas used to control the PO2and PCO2 of the perfusate was supplied by a precision mass flow controller. Stainless steel or low O2solubility polymer tubing was used to connect the equilibration column to the flow-through chamber in an effort to minimize any ambient O2 transfer into the perfusate. In previous studies, thePO2 in the chamber was confirmed under conditions identical to those of the experiments using an optical phosphorescence quenching method (17Wilson D.F. Rumsey W.L. Green T.J. Vanderkooi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2712-2718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lo L.W. Koch C.J. Wilson D.F. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 153-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar) (Oxyspot, Medical Systems Inc.). An inverted microscope was equipped for epifluorescent illumination and included a xenon light source (75 W), a 12-bit digital cooled CCD camera (Princeton Instruments), a shutter and filter wheel (Sutter), and appropriate excitation and emission filter cubes. The microscope also was equipped with Hoffman-modified phase illumination to accentuate surface topology, facilitating the measurement of contractile motion (see below). Fluorescent cell images were obtained using a 40× oil immersion objective (Nikon Plan Fluor). Data were acquired and analyzed using Metamorph software (Universal Imaging). ROS generation in cells was assessed using the probe 2,7-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) (Molecular Probes). The membrane-permeable diacetate form of the dye (reduced DCF (DCFH-diacetate)) was added to the perfusate at a final concentration of 5 μm. Within the cell, esterases cleave the acetate groups on DCFH-diacetate, thus trapping the reduced probe (DCFH) intracellularly (19Sawada G.A. Raub T.J. Decker D.E. Buxser S.E. Cytometry. 1996; 25: 254-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). ROS in the cells oxidize DCFH, yielding the fluorescent product DCF (20Rothe G. Valet G. J. Leukoc. Biol. 1990; 47: 440-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (780) Google Scholar). Our previous studies of the behavior of DCFH in cardiomyocytes revealed that the probe is readily oxidized by H2O2 or hydroxyl radical, but is relatively insensitive to superoxide (21Vanden Hoek T.L. Li C. Shao Z. Schumacker P.T. Becker L.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2571-2583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Fluorescence was measured using an excitation wavelength of 480 nm, dichroic 505-nm long pass, and emitter bandpass of 535 nm (Chroma Technology) using neutral density filters to attenuate the excitation light. Fluorescence intensity was assessed in clusters of several (<10) cells identified as regions of interest, and background was identified as an area without cells or with minimal cellular fluorescence. Intensity values are reported as percent of initial values, after subtracting background. Cell motion was recorded during low intensity visible light illumination using Hoffman modulation optics to accentuate the cellular topological changes during contraction. Images were recorded at video rates on magnetic tape using a high resolution video camera (Hammamatsu). During later analysis, sequential video frames were digitized, and pixels were assigned an intensity value ranging from 0 to 255. For each pixel, the absolute change in intensity was summed over ∼250 frames. These summed changes in intensity were summed for all pixels, providing a single measure of motion in the field that consistently described the motion that already was evident by inspection. This analysis was carried out using a series of macro instructions in the Metamorph imaging software. In different experiments the cells were treated with the electron transport inhibitors thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA), antimycin A, and rotenone (Sigma). The antioxidants 2-mercaptopropionyl glycine and 1,10-phenanthroline were also obtained from Sigma. Cultured embryonic cardiomyocytes on coverslips were placed in a flow-through chamber on an inverted microscope and perfused with buffered salt solution containing DCFH-diacetate (5 μm) under controlled O2 conditions. Fig. 1 shows the effect of hypoxia at different levels of PO2on DCF fluorescence in cardiomyocytes. Compared with normoxic cells superfused with buffered salt solution equilibrated with 15% O2 (PO2 ∼ 107 torr), cells perfused at PO2 = 35, 20, or 7 torr for 2 h showed significant increases in fluorescence that correlated with the degree of hypoxia. Restoration of normoxia at t = 150 min was associated with a progressive decrease in fluorescence, which could represent either intracellular reduction of the oxidized probe or escape of the oxidized probe from the cell. Fig. 1 b shows the effect of graded hypoxia on spontaneous contractile motion in the same cells shown in Fig. 1 a. Contractile motion was assessed by periodically recording motion at video rates under low-light illumination conditions for 1 min. Graded decreases in contractile motion were seen during hypoxia, which were reversible when normoxic conditions were restored. These results were consistent with our previous studies (2Budinger G.R.S. Chandel N. Shao Z.H. Li C.Q. Melmed A. Becker L.B. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 14: L37-L53Google Scholar). As seen previously, the decrease in contraction did not develop immediately but required 1–2 h to reach a stable level of inhibition. Likewise, full recovery of motion required 2–3 h after restoration of normoxia. To confirm that oxidant signaling was responsible for these changes, the study was repeated (3% O2, PO2∼ 20 torr) in the presence of the thiol reducing agent 2-mercaptopropionyl glycine (300 μm) and the metal chelator 1,10-phenanthroline (10 μm). In the presence of these antioxidants, the increases in cell fluorescence were significantly attenuated (Fig. 2). To determine the source of oxidants during hypoxia, cells loaded with DCFH were incubated atPO2 ∼ 20 torr (3% O2) while DCF fluorescence images were acquired. The mitochondrial electron transport inhibitors rotenone (1 μg/ml) and TTFA (10 μm) subsequently were added to block electron supply to ubiquinol, thereby limiting the formation of ubisemiquinone. This produced a rapid decrease in DCF fluorescence during hypoxia (Fig.3 a). In another experiment, cardiomyocytes loaded with DCFH and perfused under hypoxic conditions were given antimycin A, which inhibits the oxidation of cytochromeb 566, thereby increasing the lifetime of ubisemiquinone (11Turrens J.F. Alexandre A. Lehninger A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 237: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). This produced a further increase in DCFH oxidation, as detected from fluorescence measurements (Fig.3 b). To test whether oxidant signaling was involved in the suppression of contraction seen during prolonged moderate hypoxia, the antioxidants 2-mercaptopropionyl glycine (300 μm) and 1,10-phenanthroline (10 μm) were added to the perfusate during hypoxia (3% O2). As shown in Fig. 4, antioxidant treatment abolished the decreases in contractile motion seen during hypoxia, thus implicating ROS in the functional response to hypoxia. Conceivably, superoxide generated by the mitochondrial electron transport system could activate subsequent signaling steps by oxidizing a substrate directly. Alternatively, dismutation of superoxide by superoxide dismutase could yield H2O2, which could function as the active intermediate in this response. To test this possibility, contractile motion was studied in cardiomyocytes perfused with different concentrations of H2O2under normoxic conditions. Fig. 5 shows the effect of 120 min perfusion with H2O2 (25 μm) on contractile motion. Within 1 h, significant decreases in contractile motion were detected. Washout of H2O2 was associated with recovery of contractile motion, although this required several hours to reach baseline levels. Interestingly, lower concentrations of H2O2 (<10 μm) did not significantly affect contractile motion during perfusion for 1 h, while higher concentrations of H2O2 (>50 μm) elicited a marked decrease or cessation of contractile activity which did not return during recovery (data not shown). Previous studies of cytochrome oxidase revealed a decrease in the V max of the enzyme during hypoxia (9Chandel N.S. Budinger G.R.S. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18672-18677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Such a change could alter the mitochondrial redox state and accelerate ROS generation by mitochondria during hypoxia. If so, then inhibitors of cytochrome oxidase that reduce theV max of the enzyme during normoxia should mimic that effect. To test this we used sodium azide, a noncompetitive inhibitor of the oxidase (22Petersen L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 460: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) to partially inhibit the oxidase during normoxia. Fig. 6 a shows the effect of different concentrations of azide on DCF fluorescence in cultured cardiomyocytes maintained at PO2 ∼ 107 torr. Low concentrations of azide (0.75–1 mm) produced graded increases in fluorescence that decreased after washout of the inhibitor. Greater increases in fluorescence were observed with higher concentrations of azide (2–5 mm), which also were reversible after removal of azide. Fig. 6 b shows the effects of azide on contractile motion of cardiomyocytes. Dose-dependent progressive decreases in contractile motion were observed during 2 h of azide treatment, which were reversible after removal of the inhibitor. However, rapid and irreversible decreases in contraction were seen with high concentrations of azide (5 mm), which were suggestive of cellular injury. To test whether O2-dependent decreases in cytochrome oxidase V max were responsible for the increase in ROS generation during hypoxia, primary rat hepatocytes were loaded with 2,7-dichlorofluorescin and studied during normoxia (1 h) followed by hypoxia (3% O2, 2 h) and reoxygenation (1 h) (Fig. 7). In previous studies, hepatocytes were shown to require 1–2 h of hypoxia in order to elicit the decrease in V max of the oxidase (8Schumacker P.T. Chandel N. Agusti A.G.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: L395-L402PubMed Google Scholar), whereas the oxidase in cardiomyocytes responded within 10 min of hypoxia (23Vanden Hoek T.L. Shao Z. Li C. Zak R. Schumacker P.T. Becker L.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: H1334-H1341PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, ROS generation should correlate temporally with the changes in V max of the oxidase among different cell types. In accordance with this hypothesis, hepatocytes showed minimal increase in DCF fluorescence during the first hour of hypoxia, but demonstrate a more rapid increase at 1.5–2 h. Upon reoxygenation, cellular fluorescence decreased toward baseline levels. Control cells maintained under normoxic conditions for the same period showed minimal increases in DCF fluorescence. Many cell types respond to changes in the local O2concentration by activating functional or adaptive responses. This suggests the existence of an O2 sensor coupled to a signal transduction system, which ultimately triggers the functional response. Although a variety of O2 sensing mechanisms are known to exist (1Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1043) Google Scholar), our previous studies suggested that mitochondria may act in that role in embryonic cardiomyocytes (2Budinger G.R.S. Chandel N. Shao Z.H. Li C.Q. Melmed A. Becker L.B. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 14: L37-L53Google Scholar, 24Budinger G.R.S. Duranteau J. Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3320-3326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The present study aimed to test the hypothesis that ROS generated by mitochondria act as second messengers in the contractile response to physiological levels of hypoxia in those cells. Our data show that mitochondrial ROS generation increases as the concentration of O2 decreases during hypoxia. Compared with normoxia (15% O2), graded increases in DCFH oxidation were observed at 5%, 3% and 1% O2, with the highest levels of oxidant signaling seen at the lowest O2 concentrations. Administration of antioxidants attenuated this oxidant signaling, and also abolished the decrease in contractile function seen during prolonged hypoxia. Dose-dependent inhibition of cytochrome oxidase with azide produced graded increases in ROS generation during normoxia and elicited reversible decreases in contraction. Exogenous administration of H2O2 produced reversible decreases in contraction during normoxia that mimicked the response to hypoxia. Collectively, these observations suggest thatPO2-dependent mitochondrial ROS generation participates in the signal transduction cascade linking the O2 sensor with the contractile response via the sequence of events: hypoxia → decreased cytochrome oxidaseV max → increased mitochondrial redox → increased mitochondrial superoxide generation → increased H2O2 generation → subsequent signaling steps → decreased contraction. The data suggest that ROS released from mitochondria participate as second messengers in the signaling pathway linking the O2 sensor to the decrease in contractile function of cardiomyocytes. We propose that the decreases in contractile function and O2consumption are a consequence of decreased ATP utilization (24Budinger G.R.S. Duranteau J. Chandel N.S. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3320-3326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), possibly arising from a signaling sequence that inhibits activation of the actin-myosin ATPase system. ROS would appear to act at an early step in this sequence, since the contractile response to hypoxia or exogenous of H2O2 required 1–2 h to develop, and recovery from these activators required 2–3 h for completion. The low levels of ROS generation during hypoxia do not appear to be toxic, as judged by the ability of the cells to recover contractile function after restoration of normoxia, and the absence of any loss of cell viability despite prolonged hypoxia noted previously (2Budinger G.R.S. Chandel N. Shao Z.H. Li C.Q. Melmed A. Becker L.B. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 14: L37-L53Google Scholar). Our study did not investigate steps subsequent to H2O2generation, but a growing number of studies indicate an important role of ROS in a variety of intracellular signaling pathways (14Flohe L. Brigelius-Flohe R. Saliou C. Traber M.G. Packer L. Free Radical. Biol. Med. 1997; 22: 1115-1126Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar, 25Monteiro H.P. Stern A. Free Radical. Biol.

For example, Guyton et al. (12Guyton K.Z. Liu Y. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Holbrook N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4138-4142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1138) Google Scholar) have shown that H2O2 can cause activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK-2, p44); Lander et al. (27Lander H.M. Hajjar D.P. Hempstead B.L. Mirza U.A. Chait B.T. Campbell S. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4323-4326Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar) have described a mechanism allowing nitric oxide to regulate the G protein p21 ras, and ROS appear to participate in the activation of stress-activated protein kinases (JNKs/SAPKs) (13Laderoute K.R. Webster K.A. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 336-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Future studies will be required to clarify the later steps in the signal transduction cascade responsible for the inhibition of contraction. Mitochondria have long been recognized as sites where reactive oxygen species are generated in cells. In the electron transport chain, ubisemiquinone (11Turrens J.F. Alexandre A. Lehninger A.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 237: 408-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar) appears to be a major site of superoxide generation because of its predisposition for univalent electron transfer to O2. Indeed, it has been estimated that superoxide generation accounts for 1–2% of mitochondrial O2 consumption even under normal conditions (28Boveris A. Oshino N. Chance B. Biochem. J. 1972; 128: 617-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (1216) Google Scholar). Two pieces of evidence support the conclusion that mitochondria were the source of ROS signals in our study. First, electron transport inhibition with rotenone (site I) plus TTFA (site II) attenuated the ROS signal during hypoxia, whereas antimycin A, an inhibitor of complex III, accelerated oxidant production (Fig.8). Rotenone and TTFA limit the formation of superoxide by attenuating formation of ubisemiquinone, whereas antimycin A augments superoxide generation by increasing the lifetime of that intermediate. Collectively, these results demonstrate that mitochondria function as a source of ROS during hypoxia, generating increasing amounts of oxidants at lower oxygen concentrations. This behavior could allow mitochondria to function as a cellular O2 sensor at physiological levels of hypoxia. Many different oxidase systems could conceivably contribute to the generation of ROS in cells. For example, Wolin and colleagues identified a cytosolic NADH oxidoreductase whose ROS generation varies in response to changes in PO2over a wide physiological range (29Mohazzab-H K.M. Fayngersh R.P. Kaminski P.M. Wolin M.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: L637-L644PubMed Google Scholar). Using homogenates of cardiac myocytes, they found that addition of NADH (but not NADPH) caused a marked increase in superoxide generation, as detected by lucigenin chemiluminescence (30Mohazzab-H K.M. Kaminski P.M. Wolin M.S. Circulation. 1997; 96: 614-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Those results suggest that the NADH-dependent oxidase is responsive to cytosolic, rather than mitochondrial, NAD(H) redox. However, their lucigenin chemiluminescence signal increased with PO2, and was greatest during 21% O2 incubation. During hypoxia their chemiluminescence signal decreased, becoming undetectable atPO2 = 8–10 torr. By contrast, using DCFH we found increases in mitochondrial oxidant generation at lowPO2 values, with the highest levels at 1% O2 (PO2 ∼ 7 torr). Because the decrease in contractile motion during hypoxia was abolished with antioxidants, and the ROS generation detected with DCFH increased under hypoxia, we conclude that the functional response to hypoxia in our study must have involved an increase in ROS production from mitochondria, rather than decreased ROS generation at lowPO2 from NAD(P)H oxidases. The factors that control the rate of ROS production by mitochondria are not fully understood, but likely include (a) the reduction state of the mitochondrial electron transport system and (b) availability of O2. Factors that increase the reduction state of the electron carriers appear to increase the generation of superoxide, even when [O2] is low. For example, accelerated mitochondrial ROS generation has been shown to occur during ischemic conditions when electron carriers are highly reduced and the cells are nearly anoxic (21Vanden Hoek T.L. Li C. Shao Z. Schumacker P.T. Becker L.B. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1997; 29: 2571-2583Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 31Piantadosi C.A. Zhang J. Stroke. 1996; 27: 327-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Likewise, increases in mitochondrial redox at a given [O2] appear to increase ROS generation (32Partridge R.S. Nonroe S.M. Parks J.K. Johnson K. Parker Jr., W.D. Eaton G.R. Eaton S.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 310: 210-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For example, both azide and antimycin A produced increases in reduction of ubiquinone during normoxia, which led to the increases in DCF fluorescence. Thus, mitochondrial superoxide generation appears to respond to changes in redox state at a given availability of O2. In our study, the increases in ROS detected during hypoxia suggest that mitochondrial reduction must have increased as PO2 was lowered. Two models could conceivably explain this change. First, we previously reported thatV max of cytochrome oxidase decreases by ∼50% during hypoxia in cardiac myocytes (2Budinger G.R.S. Chandel N. Shao Z.H. Li C.Q. Melmed A. Becker L.B. Schumacker P.T.

Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18808-18816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), and in isolated bovine heart cytochrome oxidase (9Chandel N.S. Budinger G.R.S. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18672-18677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). We now suggest that the increase in mitochondrial reduction caused by the decrease in cytochrome oxidase V max elicits an increase in mitochondrial superoxide generation. A second mechanism tending to increase mitochondrial reduction during hypoxia was described by Wilson and co-workers who measured cytochromec reduction as PO2 was reduced from 150 torr toward zero (17Wilson D.F. Rumsey W.L. Green T.J. Vanderkooi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2712-2718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Erecinska M. Wilson D.F. J. Membr. Biol. 1982; 70: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). According to their model, small increases in cytochrome c reduction occur at physiological levels of hypoxia, which tend to maintain a constant electron flux (and thus O2 consumption rate) until critically low levels of [O2] are reached. Although the increases in cytochromec reduction they reported were small during physiological hypoxia, they may nevertheless have been sufficient to augment superoxide generation. To distinguish the relative importance of these two mechanisms, we compared the ROS response in cardiac myocytes to that in normal rat hepatocytes. In their studies ofPO2-dependent cytochromec reduction, Wilson and co-workers observed increases in reduction within seconds after the start of hypoxia in a wide variety of cell types (17Wilson D.F. Rumsey W.L. Green T.J. Vanderkooi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2712-2718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Wilson D.F. Erecinska M. Drown C. Silver I.A. Arch. Biochem.

Chem. 1990; 265: 15392-15399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We previously noted that cytochrome oxidase differs among cell types with respect to the duration of hypoxia required to elicit a decrease in its V max. The oxidase in embryonic cardiac myocytes responded to hypoxia within 10 min (2Budinger G.R.S. Chandel N. Shao Z.H. Li C.Q. Melmed A. Becker L.B. Schumacker P.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 14: L37-L53Google Scholar), whereas rat hepatocytes required incubation under hypoxia for 1 to 2 h to elicit a change in V max (8Schumacker P.T. Chandel N. Agusti A.G.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: L395-L402PubMed Google Scholar,10Chandel N.S. Budinger G.R.S. Choe S.H. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18808-18816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). If the decrease in V max were responsible for the increase in ROS signal during hypoxia, then increased DCF fluorescence should not occur in hepatocytes until they had been hypoxic for >1–2 h. In contrast, if thePO2-dependent increases in mitochondrial redox described by Wilson and colleagues were responsible, the increases in ROS production would occur immediately in both cell types. As shown in Fig. 7, hepatocytes loaded with DCFH and superfused at 3% O2 showed an increase in fluorescence that did not begin until 1–2 h after the start of hypoxia, and which decreased after return of normoxia. By contrast, increases in DCF fluorescence were evident after 15 min of hypoxia in the cardiomyocytes. We conclude that changes in theV max of cytochrome oxidase during hypoxia, rather than O2-dependent changes in mitochondrial reduction state (17Wilson D.F. Rumsey W.L. Green T.J. Vanderkooi J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 2712-2718Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), must have been responsible for the increase in ROS signaling during hypoxia. As a noncompetitive inhibitor of cytochrome oxidase (22Petersen L.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 460: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), azide has effects that depend on its concentration. At high concentrations (≥2 mm) it is possible that azide could throttle mitochondrial respiration by inhibiting cytochrome oxidase. However, lower concentrations (≤2 mm) should mimic the effects of hypoxia by partially inhibiting cytochrome oxidase. This should lower the V max of the oxidase via non-competitive inhibition during normoxia. Indeed, the dose-dependent increase in reduction of electron carriers caused a graded increase in ROS generation detected by DCFH, which mediated a progressive and reversible suppression of contractile activity. However, previous studies of the effects of O2 on cytochrome oxidase V max suggested that the oxidase can function in either of two kinetic states, rather than over continuous spectrum (9Chandel N.S. Budinger G.R.S. Schumacker P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18672-18677Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Therefore, when hypoxia induces a step decrease in cytochrome oxidase V max, a step increase in superoxide generation should be seen. In this respect, the graded increases in oxidant signaling seen at lowerPO2 levels would seem paradoxical, because mitochondrial redox should remain constant while O2availability for superoxide generation would decrease. These observations suggest that additional factors may influence the rate of superoxide generation at different levels of moderate hypoxia. Further studies will be required to fully delineate the mechanisms controlling superoxide generation in the intact cell at graded levels of hypoxia."

Both proteins bind and respond to DNA breaks and both play a role in DNA damage signaling. A temporary colocalization and complex formation between these proteins has been demonstrated in mammalian cells. Here we show that free and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-bound ADP-ribose polymers target three domains in p53 protein for strong noncovalent interactions. The polymer binding sites could be mapped to two amino acid sequences in the sequence-specific core DNA binding domain of p53 (amino acid positions 153–178 and 231–253) and another one in the oligomerization domain (amino acids 326–348). In mobility shift experiments, poly(ADP-ribose) effectively prevented and reversed p53 binding to the palindromic p53 consensus sequence. Additionally, poly(ADP-ribose) also interfered with the DNA single strand end binding of p53. The results suggest that ADP-ribose polymers could play a role in regulating the DNA binding properties of p53.

The results suggest that ADP-ribose polymers could play a role in regulating the DNA binding properties of p53. The nuclear enzyme PARP 1The abbreviations used are: PARP, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase; ssDNA and dsDNA, single-stranded and double-stranded DNA, respectively. and the tumor suppressor protein p53 are both involved in DNA damage signaling. Both bind to and are activated by DNA strand breaks, albeit in a different manner. The binding of PARP involves two zinc fingers in the N-terminal DNA binding domain, and this activates the four catalytic activities in the C-terminal domain required for poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis (1De Murcia G. Ménissier de Murcia J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar). In living cells, activation occurs within seconds and leads to the covalent automodification of PARP with ADP-ribose polymers. In this reaction, the enzyme assumes a porcupine-like structure with up to 28 polymers of different sizes and structural complexities extending from the protein and a total molecular mass by far exceeding that of the 113-kDa PARP protein (for review, see Refs. 1De Murcia G. Ménissier de Murcia J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 172-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar and 2Lindahl T. Satoh M.S. Poirier G.G. Klungland A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 405-411Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that PARP-bound polymers attract selected proteins from the vicinity of DNA strand breaks (3Realini C.A. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18858-18865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting protein-polymer complexes involved exceptionally strong noncovalent interactions (4Panzeter P.L. Realini C.A. Althaus F.R. Biochem. 1992; 31: 1380-1385Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The activation and up-regulation of p53 protein in mammalian cells is a late response to DNA break formation. The C-terminal domain of p53 binds to single- and double-stranded DNA ends, and this may be the first step in the activation of the transcriptional functions of p53 (for review, see Refs. 5Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar and 6Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). Neutralizing the ssDNA binding function of p53 with a peptide spanning the C-terminal domain leads to transactivation of the sequence-specific DNA binding domain in vitro (7Hupp T.R. Sparks A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1995; 83: 237-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Microinjection of cells with an antibody specific for the C-terminal domain leads to transactivation of p53 even in the absence of induced DNA damage (8Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). Another feature in p53 activation is the stabilization and consequent up-regulation of the protein. Deletion studies revealed an essential degradation domain extending from amino acids 100 to 150 (9Li X. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4447-4451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Interestingly, E6-mediated degradation of p53 in mice could be blocked by an antibody specific for this region. This region resides within the binding site for SV-40 large T-antigen, which has also been shown to extend p53 half-life (10Ruppert J.M. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3811-3820Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recent cell biological studies suggest a functional association of PARP with p53 protein in mammalian cells. In rat cell lines constitutively expressing the temperature-sensitive p53135val, a temporary colocalization of PARP and p53 was observed at the permissive temperature. Furthermore, a PARP·p53 complex could be reciprocally coprecipitated from these cells with anti-PARP or anti-p53 antibodies (11Wesierska-Gadek J. Bugajaska-Schretter A. Cerni C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 62: 90-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Reciprocal coprecipitation of PARP·p53 complexes has also been demonstrated in human cells expressing wild-type p53 protein (12Vaziri H. West M.D. Allsopp R.C. Davison T.S. Wu Y.S. Arrowsmith C.H. Poirier G.G. Benchimol S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6018-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Here we report that ADP-ribose polymers, either free or PARP-bound, target specific binding sites in p53 protein. Three polymer binding domains located in the core DNA binding and the oligomerization domains of p53 were identified. Polymer binding affected two major DNA binding functions of p53 protein, i.e. the sequence-specific binding to a p53 consensus sequence as well as the nonspecific binding to single strand DNA ends. Human and murine p53 proteins were immunopurified from Sf9 insect cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses as described previously (13Bargonetti J. Friedman P.N. Kern S.E. Vogelstein B. Prives C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1083-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and were a generous gift of Dr. U. Hübscher (Department of Biochemistry, University of Zürich-Irchel). The purified proteins migrated as a single band on SDS polyacrylamide gels. Anti-p53 antibody Pab421 was from Calbiochem. Histones and lysozyme were purchased from Sigma. Custom-designed synthetic oligopeptides were obtained from Anawa Biomedical Services and Products, Wangen, Switzerland. Synthetic oligonucleotides were purchased from Microsynth (Switzerland). The following oligonucleotides were used: 5′-GACGAATGCGCCGCAAGAAGCCCCCATAGCGTTTGT-3′ (36-mer, N2) (14Bakalkin G. Yakovleva T. Selivanova G. Magnusson K.P. Szekely L. Kiseleva E. Klein G. Terenius L. Wiman K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar) and 5′-CTAGAGGACATGCCCGGGCATGTCCT-3′ (26-mer) and its complementary strand 5′-AGGACATGCCCGGGCATGTCCTCTAG-3′ containing the palindromic consensus p53 target sequence (13Bargonetti J. Friedman P.N. Kern S.E. Vogelstein B. Prives C. Cell. 1991; 65: 1083-1091Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 15Niewolik D. Vojtesek B. Kovarik J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 881-890PubMed Google Scholar). Single-stranded oligonucleotides were 5′-end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and annealed to the complementary strand. Free or PARP-bound ADP-ribose polymers were synthesized with purified PARP (4Panzeter P.L. Realini C.A. Althaus F.R. Biochem. 1992; 31: 1380-1385Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Free polymers were isolated by affinity chromatography on dihydroxyboronate resin. They had an average chain length of 16–20 residues, with ∼6% of total ADP-ribose moieties being incorporated in branched polymeric chains (16Malanga M. Bachmann S. Panzeter P.L. Zweifel B. Althaus F.R. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 245-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). After electrophoretic separation on SDS polyacrylamide gels (17Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 620-625Crossref Scopus (207208) Google Scholar), proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose using a SemiPhor transfer system (Bio-Rad). Alternatively, purified proteins or synthetic polypeptides were blotted onto nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher & Schuell, 0.2 μm pore size) using a Bio-Rad dot blot apparatus. Proteins on nitrocellulose were gold-stained using the Protogold staining kit (British BioCell International), as recommended by the manufacturer. The blots were incubated with radiolabeled free or PARP-bound ADP-ribose polymers as described previously (18Panzeter P.L. Zweifel B. Malanga M. Waser S.H. Richard M. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17662-17664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the nitrocellulose membrane was rinsed with three changes of Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 10 mm Tris, 0.15 m NaCl, pH 7.4) containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 (TBST). Polymers of [32P]ADP-ribose (0.5 μCi/nmol ADP-ribose; 0.5 nmol of total ADP-ribose) were dissolved in 10 ml of TBST and added to the nitrocellulose. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, the membranes were extensively washed with TBST, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. For the incubations with PARP-bound polymers, nitrocellulose filters were blocked with 5% milk powder (in TBST) for 1 h at room temperature. 2 pmol of automodified PARP were freshly prepared in a 100-μl reaction volume as described (4Panzeter P.L. Realini C.A. Althaus F.R. Biochem. 1992; 31: 1380-1385Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar), diluted with 10 ml of TBST, and immediately used for incubations of the filters. The presence of residual DNA (60 ng/ml) and NAD+ (1.5 μm) did not disturb polymer-protein interactions (3Realini C.A. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18858-18865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and residual radiolabeled NAD+ did not bind to the blotted proteins, as determined in separate experiments (not shown). Binding of p53 to ss- and dsDNA was assayed by electrophoretic mobility shift (19Jayaraman L. Prives C. Cell. 1995; 81: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Incubation of p53 with dsDNA oligonucleotide was carried out in 20 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.9, containing 25 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.025% Nonidet P-40, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 10% glycerol, 0.2 ng of32P-labeled probe DNA, 10–40 ng of p53 protein in a final volume of 20 μl. Where indicated, sonicated herring sperm DNA (Sigma) was used as nonspecific competitor (1–3 μg/ml). The reaction mixture was incubated at room temperature for 45 min and subsequently loaded onto a native 4% polyacrylamide gel containing 0.5× TBE buffer (45 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 1 mm EDTA) and 0.05% Nonidet P-40. Samples were electrophoresed in 0.5× TBE at 200 V for 90 min at 4 °C and analyzed by autoradiography (19Jayaraman L. Prives C. Cell. 1995; 81: 1021-1029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). The binding of p53 to ssDNA was assayed by incubating the p53 protein (20–40 ng) in 40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1.5 mmdithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 20 mg/ml BSA in a final volume of 20 μl. The reaction was started by the addition of 0.3 ng (2 μl) of radiolabeled ssDNA. After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min, reaction products were analyzed by electrophoresis in a nondenaturing 5% polyacrylamide gel in 0.5× TGE buffer (25 mm Tris, 0.19 m glycine, pH 8.5, 1 mm EDTA) followed by autoradiography of the dried gel. The effect of poly(ADP-ribose) on the DNA binding activities of p53 was assayed by preincubating the p53 protein (40 ng) in the absence or presence of the indicated amount of [3H]poly(ADP-ribose) (160 dpm/pmol) for 15 min at room temperature in 20 μl of binding buffer. [3H]-Labeling was used for a precise quantification of the ADP-ribose polymers. The reaction was started by the addition of 0.1–0.3 ng (1–2 μl) of radiolabeled DNA, and the samples were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Where indicated, synthetic oligopeptides were present with poly(ADP-ribose) in the preincubation step. The ability of p53 to bind ADP-ribose polymers was tested using a nitrocellulose polymer blot assay (18Panzeter P.L. Zweifel B. Malanga M. Waser S.H. Richard M. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17662-17664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig.1 A demonstrates the polymer binding to an electrophoretically pure preparation of murine p53. Fig.1 B shows a strong dot blot signal for poly(ADP-ribose) binding to as little as 0.75 pmol of murine or human p53 protein. This binding was comparable to that of histone H1, which like other members of the histone family, has a high affinity for poly(ADP-ribose) (4Panzeter P.L. Realini C.A. Althaus F.R. Biochem. 1992; 31: 1380-1385Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar,18Panzeter P.L. Zweifel B. Malanga M. Waser S.H. Richard M. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17662-17664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). No binding was observed with proteinase K or DNase I (Fig.1 B). In the experiment shown in Fig. 2, we determined whether PARP-bound polymers could also interact with p53 protein. A comparison of the binding of free polymers (Fig.2 A, lane 1) with that of PARP-bound polymers (Fig. 2 B, lane 1) shows that the covalent linkage of polymers to the PARP enzyme does not impede interactions with p53 protein or histone H3, which served as a positive control. It should be noted that these experiments were performed under higher stringency conditions, i.e. the filters were washed twice with 1m NaCl. This treatment removed between 20 and 25% of loosely bound polymers. Under identical conditions, there was no unspecific binding of the acidic polymers (either free or PARP-bound) to a highly basic protein, i.e. lysozyme, even when excessive amounts (350 pmol of lysozyme versus 10 pmol of p53) were present on the filters. Interestingly, histone H3, which like other members of the histone family (3Realini C.A. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18858-18865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Panzeter P.L. Realini C.A. Althaus F.R. Biochem. 1992; 31: 1380-1385Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 18Panzeter P.L. Zweifel B. Malanga M. Waser S.H. Richard M. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17662-17664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) could be a natural competitor for polymer binding in vivo, did not significantly reduce polymer-p53 interactions. When free polymers (∼70 pmol of polymers of an average size of 20 residues) were first incubated for 30 min with 300 pmol of histone H3 (Fig. 2 A,lane 2) or when PARP-bound polymers (2 pmol of PARP) were preincubated with 900 pmol of histone H3 (Fig. 2 B,lane 2) and then applied to filters containing 10 pmol of p53 protein, the dot blot signals were only slightly reduced. It should be noted that one molecule of histone H3 can “neutralize” two polymer molecules of an average size of 20 residues, as reported earlier (3Realini C.A. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18858-18865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Strikingly similar results were obtained when the experiment was repeated with 10 pmol of histone H3 (instead of p53) blotted onto the filters. These data indicate that protein-bound polymers can readily exchange with suitable binding partners such as p53 or histone H3 but not with lysozyme, a protein that fails to bind to polymers in solution as well (4Panzeter P.L. Realini C.A. Althaus F.R. Biochem. 1992; 31: 1380-1385Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). To determine the binding sites, a set of synthetic oligopeptides containing partially overlapping sequences of murine p53 protein was tested. Some of these peptides were framed to contain a previously identified polymer binding sequence motif that was identified in histone H3 using the peptide walking technique. 2J. M. Pleschke, H. E. Kleczkowska, and F. R. Althaus, manuscript in preparation. Fig.3 A shows that three peptides of 23–26 amino acids tested positive in the polymer blot assay, whereas intervening and flanking sequences were negative. Interestingly, the peptides comprising amino acids positions 153–178 and 231–253 were located in the sequence-specific DNA binding domain of p53, whereas a third binding site (amino acids 326–348) coincided with the domain responsible for tetramerization of the protein. Identical results were obtained when the blots were performed with PARP-bound polymers (Fig. 3 B). This reconfirmed our earlier report on the interactions of PARP-bound polymers with selected proteins in solution (3Realini C.A. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18858-18865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We next determined whether poly(ADP-ribose) binding could interfere with the DNA binding functions of p53. First, sequence-specific binding was tested in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay using a 26-base pair oligonucleotide containing the p53 target sequence as a probe (20Funk W.D. Pak D.T. Karas R.H. Wright W.E. Shay J.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2866-2871Crossref PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). The results in Fig. 4 show that ADP-ribose polymers prevented sequence-specific DNA binding of p53 in a dose-dependent manner. This phenomenon was also observed when sonicated herring sperm DNA (5-fold excess over poly(ADP-ribose)) or a 26-nucleotide single-stranded DNA devoid of a p53 binding motif (125-fold excess) was present in the reaction mixture. That the polymer target sequence in p53 (Fig. 3) was involved in inhibiting sequence-specific DNA binding was further demonstrated with the results of Fig. 4 (last two lanes, top right). When poly(ADP-ribose) was first incubated with peptide 153–178 containing a polymer binding motif, the inhibitory action of polymers on DNA binding of full-length p53 protein was completely neutralized. By contrast, peptide 266–289, which does not bind polymers, did not neutralize the inhibitory action of poly(ADP-ribose). Additional control experiments (not shown) confirmed that heat-denatured p53 did not lead to complexes with the DNA probe and that the multiple shift bands representing p53-tetramer-DNA complexes and multiples thereof (Fig. 4; Refs. 21Chen X. Farmer G. Zhu H. Prywes R. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1837-1849Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 22Friedman P. Chen X. Bargonetti J. Prives C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This antibody causes a supershift representing the largest complexes with reduced mobility (24Wang Y. Reed M. Wang P. Stenger J.E. Mayr G. Anderson M.E. Schwedes J.F. Tegtmeyer P. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2575-2586Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Apart from the sequence-specific binding function located in the core domain, p53 binds to single- and double-stranded DNA ends (14Bakalkin G. Yakovleva T. Selivanova G. Magnusson K.P. Szekely L. Kiseleva E. Klein G. Terenius L. Wiman K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 25Bakalkin G. Selivanova G. Yakovleva T. Kiseleva E.

Bakalkin G. Grafström R.C. Wiman K.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 3560-3567Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). This function maps to the C-terminal domain of p53 protein and has been correlated to the ability of p53 to promote DNA renaturation and strand transfer (14Bakalkin G. Yakovleva T. Selivanova G. Magnusson K.P. Szekely L. Kiseleva E. Klein G. Terenius L. Wiman K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 25Bakalkin G. Selivanova G.

A single-stranded radiolabeled oligonucleotide (36 nucleotides) was used in an electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and the effect of poly(ADP-ribose) on p53 binding to ssDNA ends was determined. The autoradiographs of the gels were scanned for quantification. The results of Fig.5 A demonstrate a dose-dependent inhibition of p53·ssDNA complex formation. Interestingly, maximal inhibition of p53 binding was observed at poly(ADP-ribose) concentrations ranging from 40 to 100 nm(i.e. 0.8–2 pmol in the reaction mixture), whereas sequence-specific DNA binding was only moderately affected (Fig.5 B). Also, a comparison of the inhibition curves in Fig. 5suggests different types of polymer interactions with the p53 core domains as compared with the C-terminal oligomerization domain. Additional control experiments (data not shown) confirmed the specific involvement of the C-terminal domain of p53 in ssDNA binding, since monoclonal antibody PAb421 prevented complex formation as previously shown (14Bakalkin G. Yakovleva T. Selivanova G. Magnusson K.P. Szekely L. Kiseleva E. Klein G. Terenius L. Wiman K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 413-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that ADP-ribose polymers bind noncovalently to selected proteins, particularly histones (3Realini C.A. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18858-18865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Panzeter P.L. Realini C.A. Althaus F.R. Biochem. 1992; 31: 1380-1385Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 18Panzeter P.L. Zweifel B. Malanga M. Waser S.H. Richard M. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17662-17664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and that this binding is far stronger than would be expected from simple electrostatic interactions (3Realini C.A. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18858-18865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The histone-polymer complexes proved to be exceptionally resistant to phenol partitioning, strong acids, chaotropes, detergents, and high salt concentrations (4Panzeter P.L. Realini C.A. Althaus F.R. Biochem. 1992; 31: 1380-1385Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the binding could be localized to the tail regions of histones (18Panzeter P.L. Zweifel B. Malanga M. Waser S.H. Richard M. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17662-17664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we have identified tumor suppressor protein p53, the key component of an important DNA damage signal pathway, as a target for poly(ADP-ribose) binding. The binding involves three domains of 23–26 amino acids mapping to important functional domains of p53 (Fig. 3). Poly(ADP-ribose) changes the DNA binding functions of p53 dramatically. We have calculated that a single polymer molecule of 20 ADP-ribose residues can block (or reverse) the sequence-specific binding of four molecules of p53 to its consensus DNA sequence (Figs.4, 5), which requires the formation of a tetrameric complex. Likewise, p53 binding to single strand DNA ends was inhibited by poly(ADP-ribose) (Fig. 5). This highlights a molecular mechanism by which the polymers clustered on PARP at DNA breakage sites could affect the activation of p53 and/or interfere with its transcriptional function. Naturally, this interference could be blocked in vivo by other polymer-binding proteins, such as members of the histone family, which are more abundant in living cells than p53 protein. However, the results of Fig. 2 suggest that despite the formation of salt-stable polymer-protein complexes (for example with histone H3 or other histones (4Panzeter P.L. Realini C.A. Althaus F.R. Biochem. 1992; 31: 1380-1385Crossref Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 18Panzeter P.L. Zweifel B. Malanga M. Waser S.H. Richard M. Althaus F.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17662-17664Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)), complexed polymers may readily exchange with suitable binding partners such as p53 protein and form new complexes. The possibility of a dynamic exchange of binding partners is a new feature of poly(ADP-ribose)-protein interactions that needs to be pursued in more detail. Recent reports shed light on possible mechanisms by which poly(ADP-ribose) could play the role of an endogenous transactivator of p53 functions. Neutralizing the ssDNA binding function of p53 with a peptide spanning the C-terminal domain has been shown to transactivate the sequence-specific DNA-binding function in vitro (7Hupp T.R. Sparks A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1995; 83: 237-245Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Microinjection of cells with an antibody specific for the C-terminal domain leads to transactivation of p53 even in the absence of induced DNA damage (8Hupp T.R. Meek D.W. Midgley C.A. Lane D.P. Cell. 1992; 71: 875-886Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (864) Google Scholar). The present study suggests that poly(ADP-ribose) could be a resident factor at DNA breakage sites, relaying transactivation of p53 by neutralizing the ssDNA binding C-terminal domain. Alternatively, poly(ADP-ribose) could block the transcriptional role of p53 by inhibiting its sequence-specific binding activity located in the core domain of the protein (5Cox L.S. Lane D.P. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 501-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 6Ko L.J. Prives C. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 1054-1072Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar). Another possibility is that poly(ADP-ribose) plays a role in p53 up-regulation by protecting the protein from proteolytic degradation. It is noteworthy that one polymer binding site (amino acids positions 153–178; Fig. 3) is located near a proteolytic cleavage site, suggesting that polymer binding may protect this sequence or make it conformationally unaccessible to proteolysis. Such protection has been observed following binding of SV-40 large T antigen to this region (10Ruppert J.M. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 3811-3820Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or when monoclonal antibodies were bound adjacently to this region (9Li X. Coffino P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4447-4451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Several recent reports shed light on how poly(ADP-ribose) could be involved in p53 regulation in mammalian cells in vivo. Apart from the demonstration of a temporary colocalization of PARP and p53 protein in rodent cells, PARP·p53 complexes could be coprecipitated with anti-PARP and anti-p53 antibodies from rodent and human cells (11Wesierska-Gadek J. Bugajaska-Schretter A. Cerni C. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 62: 90-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 12Vaziri H. West M.D. Allsopp R.C. Davison T.S. Wu Y.S. Arrowsmith C.H. Poirier G.G. Benchimol S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6018-6033Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Another report (27Whitacre C.M. Hashimoto H. Twsai M.L. Chatterjee S. Berger S.J. Berger N.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3697-3701PubMed Google Scholar) shows that mutant V79 cells, either deficient in poly(ADP-ribosylation) activity or with reduced NAD+ availability for poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis, are severely deficient in constitutive p53 expression and p53 up-regulation after treatment with etoposide, a topoisomerase II inhibitor. These cells were also deficient in downstream end points of p53 signaling,i.e. lack of activation of a reporter gene under the control of a p53 consensus binding sequence and no induction of apoptosis by etoposide (27Whitacre C.M. Hashimoto H. Twsai M.L. Chatterjee S. Berger S.J. Berger N.A. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3697-3701PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with these observations, embryonic fibroblasts from PARP-null mice were found to express very low constitutive levels of p53 protein and a 4–5-fold lower up-regulation of p53 protein in response to DNA damage as compared with PARP-proficient control cells (28Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Wang Z.Q. Wagner E.F. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Taken together these data indicate that poly(ADP-ribose) plays a positive role in p53 activation and up-regulation. However, it is likely that the interrelationship between poly(ADP-ribose) and p53 is more complex. A recent report on the PARP-null cell phenotype suggests that poly(ADP-ribose) plays both an upstream as well as a collateral role in DNA damage signaling through p53 (28Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Wang Z.Q. Wagner E.F. Stark G.R. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1035-1041Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar)."

Two amino-terminal sites on vimentin, Ser38 and Ser71, were identified as the major phosphorylation sites for Rho-kinase, and Ser71 was the most favored and unique phosphorylation site for Rho-kinase in vitro. To analyze the vimentin phosphorylation by Rho-kinasein vivo, we prepared an antibody GK71 that specifically recognizes the phosphorylation of vimentin-Ser71. Ectopic expression of constitutively active Rho-kinase in COS-7 cells induced phosphorylation of vimentin at Ser71, followed by the reorganization of vimentin filament networks. During the cell cycle, the phosphorylation of vimentin-Ser71 occurred only at the cleavage furrow in late mitotic cells but not in interphase or early mitotic cells. This cleavage furrow-specific phosphorylation of vimentin-Ser71 was observed in the various types of cells we examined. All these accumulating observations increase the possibility that Rho-kinase may have a definite role in governing regulatory processes in assembly-disassembly and turnover of vimentin filaments at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis.

An important feature of IF proteins is their tissue preferential expression. For example, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is expressed specifically in astroglia. On the other hand, vimentin is the most common IF protein and is expressed during development in a wide range of cells, in mesenchymal cells and in a variety of cultured cells and tumors. Previous studies have demonstrated that IFs can undergo dynamic changes in their organization during different stages of the cell cycle or during cell signaling (for review see Refs. 1Eriksson J.E. Opal P. Goldman R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 2Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev.

The reorganization of IFs is thought to be regulated by site-specific phosphorylation of IF proteins at serine and threonine residues, and several protein kinases have been shown to act as IF kinases in vivo (Ref. 4Inagaki M. Nishi Y. Nishizawa K. Matsuyama M. Sato C. Nature. 1987; 328: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar; for review see Ref. 5Inagaki M. Matsuoka Y. Tsujimura K. Ando S. Tokui T. Takahashi T. Inagaki N. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 481-487Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Site- and phosphorylation state-specific antibodies that can recognize a phosphorylated serine/threonine residue and its flanking sequence are powerful tools to visualize site-specific IF phosphorylation in cells and to identifyin vivo IF kinases (Refs. 6Nishizawa K.

(Tokyo). 1997; 121: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). By using several types of such antibodies, we previously detected a protein kinase activity that phosphorylates GFAP at Thr7, Ser13, and Ser34 specifically at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis (6Nishizawa K. Yano T. Shibata M. Ando S. Saga S. Takahashi T. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3074-3079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Matsuoka Y. Nishizawa K. Yano T. Shibata M. Ando S. Takahashi T. Inagaki M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2895-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). This kinase activity, tentatively named cleavage furrow (CF) kinase activity, was observed not only in astroglial cells but also in other cultured cells in which GFAP was ectopically expressed (10Sekimata M. Tsujimura K. Tanaka J. Takeuchi Y. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that the activation of CF kinase occurs in a wide range of cell types, suggesting its important role in cytokinesis. Using a series of monoclonal antibodies (MO6, YT33, TM50, 4A4, and MO82) which specifically recognize the phosphorylation of vimentin at Ser6, Ser33, Ser50, Ser55, and Ser82, respectively, we visualized in vivo vimentin kinase activities in cell signaling or mitosis (11Tsujimura K.

However, one could not rule out the possibility that other unknown kinase(s) are responsible for the CF kinase activity because these three phosphorylation sites are phosphorylated by several kinasesin vitro.In this report, we showed that vimentin was phosphorylated by Rho-kinase in a GTP·Rho-dependent manner and that vimentin phosphorylation by Rho-kinase resulted in a nearly complete inhibition of its filament formation in vitro. We then identified Ser71 on vimentin as the most favored and unique phosphorylation site for Rho-kinase in vitro. By producing a site- and phosphorylation state-specific antibody for this site, we demonstrated that vimentin-Ser71 was phosphorylated specifically at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis in various types of cells.DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we obtained evidence that Rho-kinase phosphorylates vimentin in a GTP·Rho-dependent manner and that the phosphorylation of vimentin by Rho-kinase prevents its filament formation in vitro. Vimentin-Ser71, which was identified here as the phosphorylation site specific to Rho-kinase in vitro, was shown to be specifically phosphorylated at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis.One of the dynamic changes in cellular morphology during mitosis is the reorganization of three major cytoskeletal structures, microfilaments (actin filaments), microtubules, and intermediate filaments (IFs). Two distinct cytoskeletal structures, a bipolar mitotic spindle and a contractile ring, appear transiently and play active roles in the mitotic phase of animal cells (for review, see Refs. 44Mabuchi I. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1986; 101: 175-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar and 45Rappaport R. Int. Rev. Cytol. 1986; 105: 245-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). A bipolar mitotic spindle is composed of microtubules and their associated proteins and divides the replicated chromosomes for each daughter cell. A contractile ring is composed of actin filaments and myosin just beneath the plasma membrane and divides the cell into two by pulling the membrane inward (for review, see Refs. 46Perry M.M. John H.A. Thomas N.S. Exp. Cell Res. 1971; 65: 249-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar and 47Schroeder T.E. Exp. Cell Res. 1968; 53: 272-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Unlike microtubules and actin filaments which are largely reorganized for the specific mitotic functions described above, the behavior of IFs during mitosis differs depending on cell types. Rosevear et al. (48Rosevear E.R. McReynolds M. Goldman R.D. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 1990; 17: 150-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) reported changes of IF network in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells during different stages of mitosis. During prometaphase/metaphase, the typical network of long 10-nm diameter IFs characteric of interphase cells disassembled into aggregates containing short 4–6-nm filaments. During anaphase/telophase, arrays of short IFs reappeared throughout cytoplasm, and in cytokinesis, the majority of IFs was longer and concentrated mainly in a juxtanuclear cap. Frankeet al. (49Franke W.W. Schmid E. Grund C. Geiger B. Cell. 1982; 30: 103-113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 50Franke W.W. Grund C. Kuhn C. Lehto V.-P. Virtanen I. Exp. Cell Res. 1984; 154: 567-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) observed punctate or granular structures of IFs even during cytokinesis in some types of cells. However, IFs of many types of cells appeared to be interrupted as intact bundles in the plane of the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis (51Blose H.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 3372-3376Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 52Franke W.W. Schmid E. Wellsteed J. Grund C. Gigi O. Geiger B. J.

There seems to be a mechanism that accounts for the locally controlled breakdown of the filaments before the final separation of daughter cells. In vitro studies revealed that the site-specific phosphorylation of IF proteins by several kinases induced disassembly of the filament structure (for review, see Ref. 5Inagaki M. Matsuoka Y. Tsujimura K. Ando S. Tokui T. Takahashi T. Inagaki N. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 481-487Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Protein kinase A, protein kinase C, CaM kinase II, and Cdc2 kinase have been known as such kinases. In a previous study (37Kosako H. Amano M. Yanagida M. Tanabe K. Nishi Y. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10333-10336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and in the present study, we demonstrated that Rho-kinase also acts as an in vitro IF kinase which induces alterations in the filament structure.Identifying protein kinases responsible for in vivo IF phosphorylation is of great importance in order to understand how cellular IF reorganization is regulated. As a method for the identification of in vivo IF kinases, we have utilized site- and phosphorylation state-specific antibodies (for review, see Ref. 8Inagaki M. Inagaki N. Takahashi T. Takai Y. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1997; 121: 407-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Among the in vitro phosphorylation sites, there are sites specifically phosphorylated by a single kinase. For example, Ser33, Ser55, and Ser82 on vimentin are site-specific for protein kinase C, Cdc2 kinase, and CaM kinase II, respectively (Fig. 4 A). These specific sites can serve as a pertinent indicator for the detection of in vivo IF phosphorylation by the kinase. To determine whether Cdc2 kinase phosphorylates vimentin in vivo, a monoclonal antibody 4A4 that recognizes the phosphorylation of Ser55 on vimentin was produced (11Tsujimura K. Ogawara M. Takeuchi Y. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Ha M.H. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31097-31106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ser55 was phosphorylated in various types of cells only during early mitotic phase, and the chromatographic analysis of mitotic cell lysates revealed a single peak of Ser55 kinase activity that is identical to Cdc2 kinase. These data together with data obtained by tryptic phosphopeptide analysis (55Chou Y.-H. Bischoff J.R. Beach D. Goldman R.D. Cell. 1990; 62: 1063-1071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) strongly suggest that Cdc2 kinase directly phosphorylates vimentin in mitotic cells. By using antibodies recognizing the phosphorylation of the distinct specific sites on vimentin, we further identified protein kinase C and CaM kinase II as in vivovimentin kinases that act during cell cycle and cell signaling, respectively (12Ogawara M. Inagaki N. Tsujimura K. Takai Y. Sekimata M. Ha M.H. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Hirai S. Ohno S. Sugiura H. Yamauchi T. Inagaki M. J.

By producing and utilizing the site- and phosphorylation state-specific antibody GK71 which recognizes the phosphorylation of Ser71, we have demonstrated that vimentin-Ser71is specifically phosphorylated at the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis. This observation suggests the possibility that Rho-kinase may be responsible for the cleavage furrow-specific phosphorylation of vimentin.Rho was reported to be translocated from the cytosol to the cleavage furrow (56Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Tsukita S. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 39-48PubMed Google Scholar) and to play a critical role in inducing and maintaining the contractile ring during cytokinesis (22Kishi K. Sasaki T. Kuroda S. Itoh T. Takai Y. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1187-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar, 23Mabuchi I. Hamaguchi Y. Fujimoto H. Morii N. Mishima M. Narumiya S.

Inagaki, unpublished observations. These accumulating observations allow us to speculate on the possible mechanism regulating cytokinesis. The GTP-bound active form of Rho concentrated at the cleavage furrow may bind to and activate its specific targets around the cleavage furrow. Rho-kinase may phosphorylate several proteins including vimentin specifically at the cleavage furrow. Since phosphorylation of GFAP at Thr7, Ser13, and Ser34 was also observed at the cleavage furrow (9Matsuoka Y. Nishizawa K. Yano T. Shibata M. Ando S. Takahashi T. Inagaki M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2895-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 10Sekimata M. Tsujimura K. Tanaka J. Takeuchi Y. Inagaki N. Inagaki M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 635-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and these three sites were phosphorylated by Rho-kinase in vitro(37Kosako H. Amano M. Yanagida M. Tanabe K. Nishi Y. Kaibuchi K. Inagaki M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10333-10336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), Rho-kinase might also phosphorylate GFAP during cytokinesis. The cleavage furrow-specific phosphorylation of vimentin and GFAP might contribute to the efficient separation of these IF structures and allow the cleavage furrow to contract unencumbered by continuous filaments. So far, myosin binding subunit of myosin phosphatase (31Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar) and myosin light chain (39Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20246-20249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar) have been identified as other putative substrates for Rho-kinase. Phosphorylation of these proteins by Rho-kinase resulted in activation of myosin ATPase by actin (31Kimura K. Ito M. Amano M. Chihara K. Fukata Y. Nakafuku M. Yamamori B. Feng J. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1996; 273: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (2423) Google Scholar, 39Amano M. Ito M. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Chihara K. Nakano T. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20246-20249Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1662) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is a possibility that Rho-kinase may also play an important role in the contraction and the formation of the contractile ring through the phosphorylation of these proteins.Rho is known to regulate the assembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers in response to extracellular signals, such as lysophosphatidic acid (15Ridley A.J. Hall A. Cell. 1992; 70: 389-399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3797) Google Scholar). Rho-kinase was recently reported to act downstream of Rho in the regulation of the formation of stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes (43Amano M. Chihara K. Kimura K. Fukata Y. Nakamura N. Matsuura Y. Kaibuchi K. Science. 1997; 275: 1308-1311Crossref PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 57Leung T. Chen X.-Q. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 118-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar). These studies suggested that Rho may activate Rho-kinase to control actin filament reorganization in response to extracellular signals during interphase. However, vimentin phosphorylation at Ser71 did not occur in interphase cells cultured in the presence of the serum, which contains lysophosphatidic acid (Fig. 7). Furthermore, the phosphorylation of vimentin-Ser71 was not observed when quiescent serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells were stimulated by lysophosphatidic acid. 3H. Goto, H. Kosako, and M. Inagaki, unpublished observations. Why was vimentin phosphorylated by constitutively active Rho-kinase in COS-7 cells but not by endogenous activated Rho-kinase in interphase cells? One possible explanation is the compartmentalized distribution of activated Rho-kinase in the cell. Since Rho-kinase in the cytoplasm is thought to be translocated to membranes by forming a complex with GTP-bound Rho (33Matsui T. Amano M. Yamamoto T. Chihara K. Nakafuku M. Ito M. Nakano T. Okawa K. Iwamatsu A. Kaibuchi K. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2208-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar, 34Leung T. Manser E. Tan L. Lim L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29051-29054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar), endogenous activated Rho-kinase might be kept apart from cytoplasmic vimentin-IFs and unable to phosphorylate vimentin in interphase cells. Definitive mechanism governing the cleavage furrow-specific phosphorylation of vimentin at Ser71remains unclear, but the contractile force might partly contribute to the interaction between cytoplasmic vimentin-IFs and membrane-bound active Rho-kinase at the cleavage furrow.Since Rho-kinase belongs to a family of related serine/threonine kinases including myotonic dystrophy kinase, these kinases may phosphorylate the similar sites on vimentin and GFAP. Further investigations are necessary to elucidate the relationship between IF phosphorylation at the cleavage furrow and Rho-kinase or its family members during cytokinesis. Intermediate filaments (IFs) 1The abbreviations used are: IF, intermediate filament; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; CF kinase, cleavage furrow kinase; protein kinase A, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; CaM kinase II, Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-(3-O-thio)-triphosphate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidine-2-phenylindole-dihydrochloride; mAb, monoclonal antibody; TN-16, 3-(1-anillinoethylidene)-5-benzylpyrrolidine-2,4-dione; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: IF, intermediate filament; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; CF kinase, cleavage furrow kinase; protein kinase A, cAMP-dependent protein kinase; CaM kinase II, Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-(3-O-thio)-triphosphate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidine-2-phenylindole-dihydrochloride; mAb, monoclonal antibody; TN-16, 3-(1-anillinoethylidene)-5-benzylpyrrolidine-2,4-dione; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. constitute one of the three major cytoskeletal elements in eukaryotic cells. An important feature of IF proteins is their tissue preferential expression. For example, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is expressed specifically in astroglia. On the other hand, vimentin is the most common IF protein and is expressed during development in a wide range of cells, in mesenchymal cells and in a variety of cultured cells and tumors. Previous studies have demonstrated that IFs can undergo dynamic changes in their organization during different stages of the cell cycle or during cell signaling (for review see Refs. 1Eriksson J.E. Opal P. Goldman R.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1992; 4: 99-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 2Fuchs E. Weber K. Annu. Rev.

The reorganization of IFs is thought to be regulated by site-specific phosphorylation of IF proteins at serine and threonine residues, and several protein kinases have been shown to act as IF kinases in vivo (Ref. 4Inagaki M. Nishi Y. Nishizawa K. Matsuyama M. Sato C. Nature. 1987; 328: 649-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar; for review see Ref. 5Inagaki M. Matsuoka Y. Tsujimura K. Ando S. Tokui T. Takahashi T. Inagaki N. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 481-487Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Site- and phosphorylation state-specific antibodies that can recognize a phosphorylated serine/threonine residue and its flanking sequence are powerful tools to visualize site-specific IF phosphorylation in cells and to identifyin vivo IF kinases (Refs. 6Nishizawa K.

https://openalex.org/W2050434322,"The natriuretic peptide family consists of three structurally related endogenous ligands: atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP). The biological actions of natriuretic peptides are thought to be mediated through the activation of two guanylyl cyclase (GC)-coupled receptor subtypes (GC-A and GC-B). In this study, we examined the effects of ANP and CNP, which are endogenous ligands for GC-A and GC-B, respectively, on bone growth using an organ culture of fetal mouse tibias, an in vitro model of endochondral ossification. CNP increased the cGMP production much more potently than ANP, thereby resulting in an increase in the total longitudinal bone length. Histological examination revealed an increase in the height of the proliferative and hypertrophic chondrocyte zones in fetal mouse tibias treated with CNP. The natriuretic peptide stimulation of bone growth, which was mimicked by 8-bromo-cGMP, was inhibited by HS-142-1, a non-peptide GC-coupled natriuretic peptide receptor antagonist. The spontaneous increase in the total longitudinal bone growth and cGMP production was also inhibited significantly by HS-142-1. CNP mRNA was expressed abundantly in fetal mouse tibias, where no significant amounts of ANP and BNP mRNAs were detected. A considerable amount of GC-B mRNA was present in fetal mouse tibias. This study suggests the physiologic significance of the CNP/GC-B pathway in the process of endochondral ossification."
https://openalex.org/W1972397627,"An imbalance between proteases and antiproteases is thought to play a role in the inflammatory injury that regulates wound healing. The activities of some proteases and antiproteases found in inflammatory fluids can be modified in vitro by heparin, a mast cell-derived glycosaminoglycan. Because syndecans, a family of cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans, are the major cellular source of heparin-like glycosaminoglycan, we asked whether syndecans modify protease activities in vivo.Syndecan-1 and syndecan-4 ectodomains are shed into acute human dermal wound fluids (Subramanian, S. V., Fitzgerald, M. L., and Bernfield, M. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 14713–14720). Moreover, purified syndecan-1 ectodomain binds cathepsin G (K d = 56 nm) and elastase (K d = 35 nm) tightly and reduces the affinity of these proteases for their physiological inhibitors. Purified syndecan-1 ectodomain protects cathepsin G from inhibition by α1-antichymotrypsin and squamous cell carcinoma antigen 2 and elastase from inhibition by α1-proteinase inhibitor by decreasing second order rate constants for protease-antiprotease associations (k ass) by 3700-, 32-, and 60-fold, respectively. Both enzymatic degradation of heparan sulfate and immunodepletion of the syndecan-1 and -4 in wound fluid reduce these proteolytic activities in the fluid, indicating that the proteases in the wound environment are regulated by interactions with syndecan ectodomains. Thus, syndecans are shed into acute wound fluids, where they can modify the proteolytic balance of the fluid. This suggests a novel physiological role for these soluble heparan sulfate proteoglycans.

Multiple factors orchestrate the inflammatory response to tissue injury. These include proteases, antiproteases, cytokines, chemokines, and the growth factors derived from the plasma and cells associated with the injury, as well as from cells invading the injury site (1Clark R.A.F. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of Wound Repair. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1996Google Scholar). Emigrating polymorphonuclear leukocytes release proteolytic enzymes into the injury site, including the most potent serine proteases, neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G (CatG). 1The abbreviations used are: CatG, neutrophil cathepsin G; α1-Achy, α1-antichymotrypsin; α1-PI, α1-proteinase inhibitor; SCCA2, squamous cell carcinoma antigen 2; Suc-AAPF-pNA, succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-para-nitroanilide; ACE, affinity co-electrophoresis; HS, heparan sulfate; Hase, heparinase; HSase, heparitinase; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; serpin, serine protease inhibitor; CBZ, benzyloxycarbonyl.

However, these enzymes can also destroy tissues when proteolysis is prolonged, inappropriate, or excessive (5Bieth J.G. Mecham R.P. Biology of Extracellular Matrix: Regulation of Matrix Accumulation.

Serine protease inhibitors (serpins), provide efficient control mechanisms to prevent undesirable extracellular protein degradation at the injury site (8Travis J. Salvesen G.S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 52: 655-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (1484) Google Scholar). These antiproteases, mostly derived from plasma, share three principal properties: (i) they form 1:1 covalent complex with proteases, (ii) complex formation results in both inactivation of the protease and proteolytic cleavage of the serpin, and (iii) inhibition is essentially irreversible (9Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Olson S.T. Serpins: Structure, Function and Biology. R. G. Landes Co., Austin, TX1996Google Scholar). The balance of proteases and antiproteases at the site of injury can regulate the extent of the inflammatory response during the repair process (10Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol.

Dermal wound repair requires harmonious protease-antiprotease interactions or proteolytic balance. Excessive elastase action in the wound bed can account for endothelial damage (12Coleridge-Smith P.D. Thomas P. Scurr J.H. Dormandy J.A. Br. Med.

Physiological neutrophil elastase inhibitors include plasma-derived α2-macroglobulin and, most importantly, α1-proteinase inhibitor (also known as α1-PI, α1-antitrypsin, or α1-AT). The importance of α1-PI in regulating the response to tissue injury is emphasized by the extensive elastin and collagen fiber destruction leading to pulmonary emphysema in the lungs of individuals with congenital α1-PI deficiency (5Bieth J.G. Mecham R.P. Biology of Extracellular Matrix: Regulation of Matrix Accumulation. Academic Press Inc., Orlando, FL1986: 217-320Google Scholar). The major physiological cathepsin G inhibitor is α1-antichymotrypsin (α1-Achy), another plasma-derived serpin (15Beatty K. Bieth J. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3931-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inherited α1-Achy deficiency is pleiomorphic, but it is often associated with chronic active hepatitis and increased residual lung volumes (16Eriksson S. Lindmark B. Lilja H. Acta Med.

Another serpin that inhibits cathepsin G is the squamous cell carcinoma antigen 2 (SCCA2), a newly described product of skin and respiratory tract epithelia (17Schick C. Kamachi Y. Bartuski A.J.

Although the activity of one class of serpins is accelerated by binding to heparin or other glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) (9Gettins P.G.W. Patston P.A. Olson S.T.

Chem. 1991; 266: 15356-15362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ermolieff J. Boudier C. Laine A. Meyer B. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29502-29508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This binding inhibits the enzymatic activities, but most importantly, it reduces the ability of the enzymes to interact with serpins (19Frommherz K.J. Faller B. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15356-15362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ermolieff J. Boudier C. Laine A. Meyer B. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29502-29508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The heparin used clinically and in these studies is a pharmaceutical product derived from processing of the heparin proteoglycan within mast cells (21Stevens R.L. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1989; 297: 131-143PubMed Google Scholar). The major physiological source of the heparin-like GAG, heparan sulfate, is found in proteoglycans within cells, at the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix (22Yanagishita M. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9451-9454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most cellular heparan sulfate derives from the syndecan family of cell surface proteoglycans. This family (currently known as syndecan 1–4 in mammals) consists of single transmembrane proteins containing conserved cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains and less well conserved extracellular domains (ectodomains), which bear variable numbers of GAG chains. All syndecans bear heparan sulfate, although syndecan-1 and -3 can also bear chondroitin sulfate. Syndecans bind many of the factors that orchestrate the inflammatory response to tissue injury as well as a variety of extracellular matrix components and adhesion molecules via their heparan sulfate chains and are individually expressed in distinct cell-, tissue-, and development-specific patterns (23Bernfield M. Kokenyesi R. Kato M. Hinkes M.T. Spring J. Gallo R.L. Lose E.J. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 365-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (968) Google Scholar). Syndecan expression is highly regulated during wound repair. During cutaneous wound repair, keratinocytes migrating from the wound edge show loss of cell surface syndecan-1 (24Elenius K. Vainio S. Laato M. Salmivirta M. Thesleff I. Jalkanen M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Concomitantly, syndecan-1 expression increases on the endothelial cells, and syndecan-4 expression increases on the dermal fibroblasts that form the granulation tissue (24Elenius K. Vainio S. Laato M. Salmivirta M. Thesleff I. Jalkanen M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 585-595Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 25Gallo R.L. Kim C. Kokenyesi R. Adzick N.S. Bernfield M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 676-683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar), apparently due to inductive action of neutrophil-derived antimicrobial peptides (26Gallo R.L. Ono M. Povsic T. Page C. Eriksson E. Klagsbrun M. Bernfield M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11035-11039Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Syndecans on cell surfaces can be cleaved near the plasma membrane, which releases the now soluble intact proteoglycan ectodomains into the surrounding milieu (27Subramanian S.V. Fitzgerald M.L. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14713-14720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). This shedding is accelerated by activation of protease (e.g. thrombin) and growth factor receptors (epidermal growth factor family members) and by the direct action of proteases (e.g. plasmin) involved in wound repair (27Subramanian S.V. Fitzgerald M.L. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14713-14720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Moreover, soluble syndecan-1 and -4 ectodomains are detected in acute dermal wound fluids (27Subramanian S.V. Fitzgerald M.L. Bernfield M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14713-14720Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Although syndecan expression and shedding are highly regulated during the response to tissue injury, the role these processes play in this response is not clear. A key aspect of the response to tissue injury is the establishment and maintenance of proteolytic balance at the wound site. The action of the major proteases, neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G, must be countered by their major inhibitors, α1-PI and α1-Achy, for normal wound repair to ensue. Loss of this balance can prevent normal repair, potentially leading to chronic wounds, which in the skin are difficult to treat satisfactorily (14Falanga V. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1993; 100: 721-725Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We postulated that because activities of the major proteases in acute wound fluids can be modified in vitro by heparin, soluble syndecan ectodomains could be involved in establishing and maintaining the proteolytic balance in wounds in vivo. We found syndecan-1 and -4 ectodomains in acute human dermal wound fluids. We also found that purified syndecan-1 ectodomain binds to both neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G, markedly reducing their affinity for serpins and thus protecting these enzymes from their physiological inhibitors. Moreover, both degradation of endogenous heparan sulfate and removal of syndecan-1 and -4 from wound fluids reduce proteolytic activities in the fluid. Thus, syndecan ectodomains maintain the proteolytic balance in acute wound fluids, a novel physiological role for soluble heparan sulfate proteoglycans. Flat bottomed, low binding 96-well microtiter plates were obtained from Costar (Cambridge, MA). Human trypsin and mouse IgG were from Sigma, human neutrophil cathepsin G and human plasma α1-PI were from Athens Research & Technology Inc. (Athens, GA), human neutrophil elastase was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), and human plasma α1-Achy was from Biodesign International (Kennebunk, ME). Purified glutathioneS-transferase-SCCA2 fusion protein was a kind gift from Dr. Gary Silverman, Children's Hospital, Boston, MA (17Schick C. Kamachi Y. Bartuski A.J. Cataltepe S. Schechter N.M.

For enzyme substrates, succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-para-nitroanilide (Suc-AAPF-pNA) for cathepsin G and N-benzoyl-Phe-Val-Arg-pNA for trypsin were from Sigma, and (benzyloxycarbonyl (CBZ)-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala)2-R110 for elastase was from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). Heparin (porcine intestinal mucosa) was from Hepar Industries Inc. (Franklin, OH), and chondroitin-6 sulfate, chondroitin sulfate ABC lyase (chondroitinase ABC, EC4.2.2.4), heparan sulfate lyase III (heparitinase, EC 4.2.2.8), and heparan-sulfate lyase I (heparinase, EC 4.2.2.7) were from Seikagaku America Inc. (Rockville, MD). The syndecan-1 ectodomain was purified to homogeneity from the conditioned medium of NMuMG mouse mammary epithelial cells (28Jalkanen M. Rapraeger A. Saunders S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 3087-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). One mg of this syndecan-1 core protein contains 5 mg of HS. 2M. Kato, H. Wang, V. Kainulainen, M. L. Fitzgerald, D. Ornitz, S. Ledbetter, and M. Bernfield, submitted for publication. cDNA for ectodomains of human syndecan-1 and -4 in glutathioneS-transferase expression vector pGEX-2T (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) were expressed as fusion proteins in Escherichia coli, induced by 0.2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 6 h at 37 °C, solubilized with 1% Triton X-100, and centrifuged 12,000 × g for 10 min. Supernatants were purified on glutathione-agarose beads (Sigma); washed with PBS; eluted with 50 mm Tris, pH 8, and 5 mm reduced glutathione (Janssen Chimica, New Brunswick, NJ); subjected to 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and detected with Coomassie Blue. Antibodies used were polyclonal antisera HSE-1 against the recombinant human syndecan-1 ectodomain (25Gallo R.L. Kim C. Kokenyesi R. Adzick N.S. Bernfield M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 676-683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar); monoclonal antibodies MCA-681 from Serotec (Oxford, United Kingdom) and dl-101 against human syndecan-1, 5G9 and 8C7 (25Gallo R.L. Kim C. Kokenyesi R. Adzick N.S. Bernfield M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 107: 676-683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) against human syndecan-4, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc. (West Grove, PA). For production of monoclonal antibodies specific to human syndecan-1, recombinant syndecan-1 was used for immunization of mice, and production of monoclonal antibody was by Maine Biotechnology Services, Inc. (Portland, ME). Mice were immunized and boosted with 100 μg of recombinant syndecan-1. Out of 12 hybridoma clones, which produced antibodies reacting with human syndecan-1 fusion protein, only 1 (dl-101) reacted specifically with native human syndecan-1 ectodomain purified from conditioned media of human A431 cells. This was assessed as reactivity on Western blotting with a 300-kDa proteoglycan smear, which reduced to a 70-kDa core protein after treatment with heparitinase and chondroitinase ABC as described previously (30Sanderson R.D. Bernfield M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9562-9566Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). NMuMG cells were labeled with radiosulfate, and [35S]sulfate-labeled syndecan-1 ectodomain from conditioned medium was purified by DEAE and immunoaffinity chromatography (28Jalkanen M. Rapraeger A. Saunders S. Bernfield M. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 3087-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Binding of this ectodomain to elastase and cathepsin G was assessed by ACE as described elsewhere (31Kato M. Wang H. Bernfield M. Gallagher J.T. Turnbull J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1881-1980Google Scholar, 32Lee M.K. Lander A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2768-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1% (w/v) low melt agarose gels were cast containing distinct lanes with various concentrations of protease (indicated in Fig. 1). [35S]Sulfate-labeled syndecan-1 ectodomain (12,500 cpm) was electrophoresed through these lanes. In competition assays, the same amount of syndecan-1 was mixed with 1 mg/ml chondroitin-6 sulfate or heparin prior to electrophoresis. The migration on syndecan-1 was detected on a PhosphoImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The pixel intensities were integrated and used to determine the migration distance of the major peak of35S-labeled syndecan-1 in each protease-containing lane. These mobilities were plotted as a function of ligand concentration and used to estimate the apparent K d values as described earlier (32Lee M.K. Lander A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2768-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The amounts of proteases and serpins were calibrated by the method of Chase and Shaw (33Chase T.J. Shaw E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1967; 29: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). Trypsin was calibrated by usingp-nitrophenyl-p′-guanidinobenzoate (Sigma), except that 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, was used in place of sodium barbiturate buffer. The concentration of α1-PI was standardized against calibrated trypsin. Elastase and cathepsin G were calibrated against the standardized α1-PI. α1-Achy was calibrated against the standardized cathepsin G. Reaction buffers were 50 mm Hepes, 150 mmNaCl, 5% N,N-dimethylformamide, pH 7.4, for cathepsin G, and 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4, for elastase. Enzyme inhibition was determined by mixing enzyme with increasing concentrations of syndecan-1 in the appropriate reaction buffer and incubating for 15 min at 25 °C. The inhibitor was added, and residual enzyme activity was determined by adding the appropriate substrate and measuring hydrolysis at 405 nm with a UVmax microplate reader (Molecular Devices) or at 488 nm with a FluorImager 575 (Molecular Dynamics). The concentrations for cathepsin G assays were 34 nm cathepsin G, 34 nm α1-Achy or SCCA2, and 3 mm Suc-AAPF-pNA. The concentrations for elastase assays were 34 nm elastase, 34 nmα1-PI, and 5 μm(CBZ-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala)2-R110. In some experiments, syndecan-1 (up to 7.5 μg as HS) was pretreated with heparinase (150 milliunits/ml), heparitinase (150 milliunits/ml each) or chondroitinase ABC (1.0 units/ml) in 10 μl of 50 mm Tris, 10 mm NaAc, pH 7.4, for 6 h at 37 °C and boiled for 10 min. Constant concentrations of syndecan-1 ectodomain or heparin were preincubated with protease for 15 min at 25 °C with increasing concentrations of serpin in the appropriate reaction buffer, and the residual enzyme activities were measured with an appropriate substrate. The concentrations for cathepsin G assays were 34 nm cathepsin G and 3 mm Suc-AAPF-pNA in cathepsin G reaction buffer. The concentrations for elastase assays were 34 nm elastase and 5 μm (CBZ-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala)2-R110 in elastase reaction buffer. The association rate constant for the interaction of serpins with free and syndecan-1-bound enzymes was determined under second order rate conditions (15Beatty K. Bieth J. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3931-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equimolar amounts (34 nm) of enzyme with or without the syndecan-1 ectodomain and inhibitor were incubated at 25 °C for varying periods of time. The reaction was quenched by the addition of substrate, for which the enzyme has higher affinity, and the release of pNA or rhodamine was measured. The residual enzyme activities were used to calculate the concentration of free enzyme E. Protease standard curves used for calculation of free enzyme were done in the presence and absence of syndecan-1 ectodomain. The rate of change in the amount of free enzyme over time is described as 1E=kass×t+1E0Equation 1 where the slope of the plot of reciprocal remaining free enzyme (1/E) over time (t) yields a second order rate constant (k ass). Acute human dermal wound fluids were collected from reduction mammoplasty patients (samples were kindly provided by Dr. E. Eriksson, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA). Wound fluids were collected at 1-day intervals from sterile closed-suction drains routinely placed in the subcutaneous space after mammoplasty. After collection, fluids were centrifuged for 15 min at 200 × g and 4 °C to remove cells and further for 15 min at 3300 × g and 4 °C to remove debris. The supernatants were stored at −70 °C until use. Porcine wound fluid was produced, collected, and processed as described previously (26Gallo R.L. Ono M. Povsic T. Page C. Eriksson E. Klagsbrun M.

Res. 1992; 52: 50-58Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Informed consent was obtained for all procedures, and the use of anonymous discarded material was approved by the Human Research Committee (protocol 95-7509-01, Brigham and Women's Hospital). Acute wound fluids collected from several patients were blotted on Immobilon-N membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using a Dot Blot apparatus. Membranes were blocked for 60 min with 3% nonfat dry milk, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 3% H2O2, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and incubated for 60 min with polyclonal antisera HSE-1 for syndecan-1 and monoclonal antibody 5G9 for syndecan-4, followed by a 60-min incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG or horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG, respectively. Syndecans were detected by ECL according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Day 1 human wound fluids were treated with 150 milliunits/ml heparinase (Hase) and heparitinase (HSase) for 3 h at 37 °C in 50 mmHepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, to degrade endogenous heparan sulfate in the fluid. Five min after adding heparin (up to 5 μg/ml) to untreated or Hase/HSase-treated fluids, the chymotryptic and elastolytic activities in the samples were detected by adding the appropriate substrate (3 mm Suc-AAPF-pNA for chymotryptic and 5 μm (CBZ-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala)2-R110 for elastolytic activities). Hydrolysis was measured over time at 405 nm with a UVmax plate reader (Molecular Devices) or at 488 nm with a FluorImager 575 (Molecular Dynamics). Acute human dermal wound fluids precleared by centrifugation (0.5 ml) were sequentially incubated (at 4 °C for 30 min each) with a mixture of 20 μg/ml of each monoclonal antibody to syndecan-1 (DL101 and MCA-681) and syndecan-4 (5G9 and 8C7) or with 80 μg/ml of mouse IgG, 80 μg/ml rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Dako Corp., Carpinteria, CA), and protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Beads were centrifuged, and supernatants were assayed for elastolytic activity in elastase reaction buffer by adding 5 μm (CBZ-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ala)2-R110 elastase substrate and measuring hydrolysis with time at 488 nm with a FluorImager 575 (Molecular Dynamics). Because heparin can protect elastase and cathepsin G against inhibition by certain plasma-derived serpins (19Frommherz K.J. Faller B. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 15356-15362Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20Ermolieff J. Boudier C. Laine A. Meyer B. Bieth J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29502-29508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we speculated that the soluble syndecan ectodomains in wound fluid might act similarly. [35S]Sulfate-labeled syndecan-1 ectodomain purified from the conditioned media of NMuMG cells was incubated with nitrocellulose filters containing dots of purified human neutrophil cathepsin G and elastase, and serum-derived α1-PI and α1-Achy. The syndecan-1 ectodomain bound to cathepsin G and elastase at picomolar levels of protease, whereas no binding to the antiproteases was detected at 10-fold higher concentrations (data not shown). ACE (32Lee M.K. Lander A.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2768-2772Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) of [35S]sulfate-labeled syndecan-1 ectodomain with cathepsin G and elastase confirmed this binding and yielded apparent K d values of 56 nm for cathepsin G and 35 nm for elastase (Fig.1, A and C). Heparin (1 mg/ml) completely abolished binding to the proteases, whereas chondroitin sulfate (1 mg/ml) had little or no effect, indicating that the binding is mainly due to the heparan sulfate chains on syndecan-1 (Fig. 1, B and D). The ACE profiles with both enzymes showed heterogeneity in syndecan-1 ectodomain binding at concentrations near the K d values (80 nm), suggesting that there are subfractions of the ectodomain that differ in their avidity for the proteases (data not shown). To determine whether the binding of the syndecan-1 ectodomain to the proteases affects their rate of interaction with a serpin, rate constants (k ass) for these interactions were measured in the presence and absence of soluble syndecan-1 ectodomain (TableI). The protease and serpin form a 1:1 complex. Because neither heparin or the syndecan-1 ectodomain alters this stoichiometry (Fig. 2), thek ass were determined under second order conditions (15Beatty K. Bieth J. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3931-3934Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Equimolar amounts (34 nm) of protease and serpin were incubated in the presence or absence of the syndecan-1 ectodomain at concentrations indicated in Table I. After various times, complex formation was quenched by adding substrate, and the remaining free enzyme activity was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The k ass for the interaction was calculated from linear regressions (Equation 1). Thek ass for cathepsin G with α1-antichymotrypsin decreased over 3700-fold and with SCCA2 over 32-fold in the presence of the syndecan-1 ectodomain (TableI). The k ass for elastase with α1-proteinase inhibitor was decreased 60-fold by the syndecan-1 ectodomain (Table I). For comparison, second order rate constants were also measured for protease-serpin complex formation in the presence of a heparin concentration equivalent to that of the syndecan-1 ectodomain HS (Table I). At the concentrations tested, the soluble syndecan-1 ectodomain decreased the rates of protease-serpin association at least as effectively as authentic heparin. The association rate for cathepsin G and α1-antichymotrypsin was reduced to a significantly greater extent in the presence of soluble syndecan-1 ectodomain than in the presenc"

Imprinting, the transcriptional silencing of one allele of a gene depending on the sex of the transmitting parent, is an epigenetic regulatory mechanism in mammalian embryogenesis (reviewed by Barlow (1Barlow D.P. Science. 1995; 270: 1610-1613Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) and Hall (2Hall J.G. Annu. Rev. Med. 1997; 48: 35-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)). It tightly controls the expression level of a gene, and imprinted genes mostly code for proteins with an indispensable function during ontogenesis. This has been shown by the targeted disruption of several imprinted genes, such as Igf2r,Mash-2, and WT-1, which led to an embryonic or perinatal lethal phenotype of the mutant animal (3Kreidberg J.A.

Wigler M. Cell. 1986; 45: 711-719Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). It codes for a protein belonging to the class of G protein-coupled receptors with seven transmembrane domains. Angiotensin II and III have been suggested to be ligands for Mas asMas-transfected cells react with an accumulation of inositol phosphates and calcium after stimulation with these peptides (10Jackson T.R. Blair L.A. Marshall J. Goedert M. Hanley M.R. Nature. 1988; 335: 437-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Furthermore, angiotensin II can enhance [3H]thymidine incorporation in stably Mas-transfected cells after growth factor stimulation (11Wolf G. Neilson E.G. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: F768-F777Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, binding of angiotensins to Mas-expressing cells was never shown and, therefore, a direct interaction of angiotensins with Mas has been doubted. It could be shown that Mas and the product of the Mas-related gene (Mrg) enhance the effects of angiotensins on cells expressing angiotensin receptors of the AT1 subtype (12Monnot C. Weber V.

Lett. 1990; 114: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 18Martin K.A. Grant S.G.N. Hockfield S. Dev. Brain Res. 1992; 68: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Its expression in the brain is developmentally regulated, being high during embryogenesis and decreasing after birth (16Metzger R. Bader M. Ludwig T. Berberich C. Bunnemann B. Ganten D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 18Martin K.A. Grant S.G.N. Hockfield S. Dev. Brain Res. 1992; 68: 75-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The localization and the increased expression in hippocampus after brief seizure episodes suggests a role of Mas in synaptic plasticity and memory (19Martin K.A. Hockfield S. Mol. Brain Res. 1993; 19: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To clarify this role we generated and analyzed mice lacking theMas protooncogene. The animals develop and breed normally and show no obvious morphological alterations in the brain. However, hippocampal long term potentiation and anxiety are markedly affected by the mutation. Thus, Mas seems to modulate the function of receptors in the brain thereby influencing synaptic plasticity and behavior. The Mas gene was isolated from a genomic library of 129/Sv mice essentially as described for the BALB/c allele (16Metzger R. Bader M. Ludwig T. Berberich C. Bunnemann B. Ganten D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). A 950-base pair HindIII/BamHI and a 4.4-kilobase pair ScaI/XbaI fragment were used to construct the targeting vector with a neomycin resistance and herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase gene. The construct was linearized with ClaI and transfected into E14-1 embryonic stem (ES) 1The abbreviations used are: ES, embryonic stem; LTP, long term potentiation; fEPSP, field excitatory postsynaptic potential; PPD, paired-pulse depression; ACSF, artificial cerebrospinal fluid. cells (20Kühn R. Rajewsky K. Müller W. Science. 1991; 254: 707-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (1095) Google Scholar) by electroporation (single pulse of 0.5 mF, 240 V, in a 0.4-cm cuvette). The transfected cells were cultivated on confluent neomycin-resistant mitomycin-treated primary embryonal fibroblasts in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 1300 units/ml leukemia-inhibiting factor (Life Technologies, Inc.) and selected by the addition of 0.4 mg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.) and 2 μm Gancyclovir (Syntex) for 8 days. Ninety-six double-resistant clones were isolated and screened for homologous recombinants by Southern blots. Southern blotting was performed according to standard protocols using a KpnI/PstI fragment of the Mas gene. Four targeted clones were obtained, and two of them were injected into C57/Bl6 blastocysts. After retransfer into the uterus of pseudopregnant C57/Bl6 mice, five chimeras were born, three of which produced offspring heterozygous for the targeted mutation. Mas −/− mice were established by mating of the heterozygotes. Mas and β-actin expression was analyzed by RNase protection assay using a commercially available kit (Ambion), 20 μg of total RNA from testis, 40 μg from brain, and 50 μg from yeast as a control. As probes a 629-nucleotide RNA transcribed from a clonedEcoRV/ScaI fragment of the Mas gene and complementary to 531 nucleotides of the native MasmRNA and a 304-nucleotide RNA complementary to 250 nucleotides of the β-actin mRNA (Ambion) were used. For immunocytochemical staining all animals were anesthetized with Hypnodil and perfusion-fixed through the aorta with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1m phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. After postfixation overnight, 60-mm thick sections were cut with a vibratome, washed in phosphate-buffered saline (three times, 5 min each), and incubated for 15 min in 50% methanol, phosphate-buffered saline with 1% hydrogen peroxide to inactivate endogeneous peroxidase. Sections were then washed and incubated in 5% bovine serum albumin for 1 h to suppress nonspecific binding. Subsequently, sections were incubated in one of the following well characterized primary antibodies raised against parvalbumin (mouse monoclonal (Sigma); dilution, 1:5000), calbindin D-28K (mouse monoclonal (Sigma); dilution, 1:5000) calretinin (rabbit polyclonal (Swant); dilution, 1:4000), or glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (mouse monoclonal (Boehringer Mannheim); dilution, 1:500) for 36 h at room temperature. The sections were then thoroughly washed in phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with species-specific biotinylated second antibodies at a dilution of 1:200 for 1.5 h and subsequently with a Vectastain Elite kit (Vector Laboratories) at a dilution of 1:200 for 1.5 h. Visualization of the immunoreaction was performed with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and 0.01% hydrogen peroxide in Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, for 5–10 min. Finally, sections were mounted on glass slides, dehydrated, and coverslipped in D.P.X. (Aldrich). Histochemical Timm staining was performed using a modification of the Timm method (21Timm F. Z. Zellforsch. 1958; 48: 548-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 22Timm F. Acta Histochem. 1962; 3: 142-148Google Scholar) described by Danscher (23Danscher G. Histochemistry. 1981; 71: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (683) Google Scholar). Briefly, animals were anesthetized with Hypnodil and perfused transcardially with Na2S (0.1%) in 0.16 m Sörensen's phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) followed by buffered glutaraldehyde (3%). Horizontal vibratome sections (30 mm) were mounted on glass slides and incubated in Timm's developing solution for 90–120 min at 30 °C. Cytoarchitectonical details of immunostained and Timm-stained sections were analyzed under a Leica DMRXE microscope, and micrographs of wild-type and Mas −/− mice were taken with a 10× numerical aperture Fluotar or 40× numerical aperture 1.0 Plan Apo objective. Hippocampal slices were prepared from male mice (7–12 weeks old). After decapitation, the brain was rapidly removed and placed into cold oxygenated physiological solution (ACSF in mm: NaCl 124, KCl 4.9, MgSO4 1.3, CaCl2 2.5, KH2PO4 1.2, NaHCO3 25.6, d-glucose 10, adjusted with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 to pH 7.4). The hippocampi were dissected out, cut into 400-μm thick slices with a tissue chopper, and transferred to a submerged chamber. There, the slices were maintained at 33 °C, superfused with oxygenated ACSF and allowed to recover for at least 1 h. A monopolar, lacquer-coated, steel electrode was placed in the stratum moleculare of the dentate gyrus to stimulate the medial perforant path input. A glass electrode filled with ACSF was lowered to the same level, but about 200 μm apart to record field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs). The initial slope of the fEPSP was used as a measure of this potential, thereby avoiding errors due to a contamination by population spikes. The medial perforant path input was distinguished by its localization and the presence of paired-pulse depression at an interpulse interval of 40 ms. After input-output (I/O) curves were generated by recording fEPSP slopes at an increasing stimulation intensity, the stimulation voltage was adjusted to 40% of the maximum, and test stimuli were applied every 5 min. Once stable responses were obtained for 50 min, LTP was induced by a triple tetanization consisting of 15 bursts of 8 pulses, 200 Hz, interburst interval 200 ms, and applied three times every 10 min. The experiments with mutant mice were interleaved with experiments with normal controls. For examination of depotentiation, LTP was generated by a single tetanization consisting of 15 bursts of 4 pulses, 100 Hz, interburst interval 200 ms. 5 min after tetanization, potentiation was reversed by a 2-min train of low frequency stimulation at 5 Hz. To check paired-pulse depression (PPD), three paired pulses with interpulse intervals of 10, 40, 100, 200, and 500 ms were delivered at 60-s intervals at a stimulation voltage adjusted to 40% of the maximum. The three responses were averaged, and the degree of PPD being defined as percent PPD (fEPSP slope second pulse × 100/fEPSP slope first pulse). Within group comparisons were performed with nonparametric analysis of variance (Friedman-test) and the Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test. Intergroup differences were analyzed by the Mann-WhitneyU test. Mice were kept under standardized conditions with an artificial 12-h dark-light cycle. They had free access to food (standard diet Altromin 1326) and water. All behavioral testing was performed between 0900 and 1200 h. The water maze was a square pool (80 cm × 80 cm, 60 cm high) filled with water (20 °C) to a depth of 40 cm. The platform (144 cm2) was submerged by 0.5 cm. For three consecutive days, each mouse was placed in the pool three times with a 5-min interval between trials. Mice were given a 120-s swim. After locating the platform, the mice were allowed to remain on it for 15 s before being returned to the home cage. Mice that did not locate the platform within 120 s were placed on it and scored as 120 s. On day 4 (probe trial), the platform was removed. The time the mice searched in the area where the platform was located during training serves as measure of memory. Escape latencies for individual mice were averaged from each daily trial. Between group comparisons were analyzed by nonparametric analysis of variance (Kruskal-Wallis test), and within group escape latencies were analyzed by nonparametric analysis of variance on repeated measures (Friedman test) with training days as repeated measure. The plus maze was made of gray Plexiglas and consisted of two open arms (30 × 5 cm) and two enclosed arm (30 × 5 × 10 cm). The arms extended from a central platform (5 × 5 cm). A slight lip (0.3 cm) on the open arms helped to prevent animals falling from the maze. The apparatus was raised to a height of 43 cm by a single central support. The maze was indirectly illuminated by two standing lamps providing 300 and 200 lux at the ends of the open and closed arms, respectively. The experiments were conducted in a sound-attenuated experimental chamber. After adaptation to laboratory conditions for at least 1 h the mouse was placed on the central platform facing an open arm. The behavior of the mouse was recorded for 10 min by an overhead videocamera linked to a recorder in an adjacent laboratory. The data were calculated as percent of total for both frequency (open arm entries/total entries × 100) and duration (time on section/total × 100). Data were analyzed by nonparametric analysis of variance (Kruskal-Wallis test) followed by post hoc Dunn's test. The targeted disruption of the Masprotooncogene was achieved by transfecting ES cells with the construct shown in Fig. 1 A. Homologous recombination led to the deletion of the region coding for the amino-terminal 253 amino acids of Mas including six transmembrane domains in homozygous mice derived from the ES cell clones (Fig.1 B) and to a loss of Mas expression in brain and testis (Fig. 1 C). The Mas −/− animals are healthy, grow normally, and show no obvious developmental abnormalities. Despite the high expression of Mas in testis (16Metzger R. Bader M. Ludwig T. Berberich C. Bunnemann B. Ganten D. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 27-32Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), the Mas −/−mice are fertile and, in males, the number and motility of spermatocytes as well as testis morphology is unchanged. Furthermore, there is no difference in drinking behavior and in intraarterially measured mean arterial pressure between wild-type andMas −/−mice. 2T. Walther and M. Bader, unpublished data. The developmental regulation of Masexpression in the hippocampus suggests a role of Mas in the morphogenesis of this brain region. Therefore, we analyzed the fine structure of the hippocampus in Mas −/− and wild-type mice using immunocytochemical markers and histochemical staining techniques which are frequently employed to visualize distinct cytoarchitectonial distribution patterns within the hippocampal formation (24Freund T.F. Buzsaki G. Hippocampus. 1996; 6: 347-470Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As neuronal markers we used antibodies against the calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin, calretinin (Figs.2, C–F, and3, C–F), and calbindin D-28K (not shown), which characterize specific subpopulations of interneurons and principal cells (25Andressen C. Blumcke I. Celio M.R. Cell Tissue Res. 1993; 271: 181-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar, 26Celio M.R.

Moreover, the spatial distribution of astrocytes was mapped by antibodies against GFAP (not shown) and the distribution of zinc positive terminals (Figs. 2, A andB, and 3, A and B) especially of the mossy fibers, was analyzed by the Timm staining (21Timm F.

As shown in Figs. 2 and 3, no obvious alterations could be detected in the morphology of the hippocampus and its subregions indicating that the cytoarchitectonical distribution patterns and the fine wiring of neuronal subtypes is not affected by Mas ablation.Figure 3Comparison of Timm staining, parvalbumin, and calretinin immunostaining in the dentate gyrus of wild-type andMas −/− mice at higher magnification. A and B, besides a prominent Timm staining in the hilus, fine zinc precipitates are seen in mossy fiber collaterals within the granular cell layer of both Mas +/+(A) and Mas −/− mice (B). Note that the inner molecular layer is spared from Timm staining.C and D, fine structural analysis of parvalbumin immunoreactivity reveals similar distribution patterns in the granular cell layer and the molecular layers of the dentate gyrus of bothMas +/+ (C) andMas −/− mice (D). E andF, strong calretinin immunoreactivity is found in cell bodies and neuropil within the hilus (HI) and in neuropil of the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus while the granular cell layer (GL) and the outer molecular layer (ML) shows only few bouton-like structures of bothMas +/+ (E) andMas −/− mice (F). The scale bar indicates 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The strong expression of Mas in the dentate gyrus (17Bunnemann B. Fuxe K. Metzger R. Mullins J. Jackson T.R. Hanley M.R. Ganten D. Neurosci. Lett. 1990; 114: 147-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) led us to investigate LTP, a use-dependent form of synaptic plasticity, in this brain region. LTP, first discovered and most intensively studied in the mammalian hippocampus, has many features that make it a candidate mechanism underlying memory formation at the cellular level. Induction of LTP in the dentate gyrus and CA1 region critically depends on activation of theN-methyl-d-aspartate subtype of the glutamate receptor (30Bliss T.V. Collingridge G.L. Nature. 1993; 361: 31-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (9396) Google Scholar), but the subsequent biochemical events are apparently not completely identical in both regions (reviewed in Chen and Tonegawa (31Chen C. Tonegawa S. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1997; 20: 157-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar)). fEPSPs were recorded in the stratum moleculare of the dentate gyrus and the increase in the initial slope of fEPSPs after high frequency tetanic stimulation was taken as a measure for LTP.Mas-deficient mice exhibited a pronounced prolongation of the synaptic potentiation, becoming significantly different from the controls after 2 h (Fig. 4). In fact, there was no decrease in LTP detectable during the recording period of 6 h. This improved maintenance of LTP was not due to an altered basal synaptic function in Mas mutants as evidenced by input-output (I/O) curves (Fig.5 C). AlthoughMas-deficient mice displayed a trend to a higher excitability, this was not statistically significant. To the best of our knowledge Mas-deficient mice are the first genetically engineered animal model with an improved LTP.Figure 5Depotentiation, basal synaptic transmission and PPD in the dentate gyrus of Mas −/− andMas +/+ mice as determined by the initial slope of the fEPSPs. A, 5 min after generating LTP by a single θ burst stimulation (TBS) at the time indicated by anarrow, the fEPSPs were depotentiated by a 2-min train of low frequency stimulation (LFS) at 5 Hz (p < 0.001, Friedman test). Average values (means ± S.E.) calculated as percentage of baseline measures (control, n = 7,triangles; Mas −/−,n = 8, squares). Note the significant increase of fEPSP slope of Mas −/− mice during the first 10 min after cessation of LFS (p < 0.05, Wilcoxon test). B, analogue traces of mutant (upper row) and control mice (lower traces), taken during base-line recording (1), immediately after tetanization (2), immediately after depotentiation (3), and 10 min thereafter (4). The superimposed traces 3 + 4(broken line, trace 3) indicate the rebound of potentiation in Mas deficient animals after cessation of LFS. C, input/output-curves Mas −/−and Mas +/+ mice. fEPSP slopes were recorded at increasing stimulation intensities until a maximum was attained. There were no significant differences between both groups. Means ± S.E. are given. Mas +/+, n = 14;Mas −/−, n = 15. D, PPD calculated from the ratio of the second fEPSP slope to the first fEPSP slope. At all interpulse intervals, no significant differences were observed between Mas-deficient mice and the wild-type controls. Means ± S.E. are given (Mas +/+,n = 8; Mas −/−,n = 9).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The results of LTP experiments prompted us to test whether deletion ofMas may affect also other forms of synaptic plasticity. Since homosynaptic long term depression, the physiological counterpart of LTP, cannot be induced in the medial perforant path of the adult rat (32Doyere V. Srebro B. Laroche S. J. Neurophysiol. 1997; 77: 571-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), we took advantage of depotentiation, the reversal of potentiation evoked by low frequency stimulation shortly after induction of LTP (33Barrionuevo G. Schottler F. Lynch G. Life Sci. 1980; 27: 2385-2391Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 34Stäubli U. Chun D. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 853-860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Wagner J.J. Alger B.E. Hippocampus. 1996; 6: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Depotentiation was shown to share several biochemical characteristics with long term depression (35Wagner J.J. Alger B.E. Hippocampus. 1996; 6: 24-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Although in theMas mutants tetanic stimulation resulted in a slightly higher magnitude of potentiation, application of a 2-min train of low frequency stimulation, 5 min after induction of LTP, resulted in both groups in a clear depotentiation of an fEPSP slope to intermediate levels significantly different from potentiation and base line (Fig. 5,p < 0.001). Thereafter, the mutants showed a significant rebound of potentiation during the following 10 min (p < 0.05), whereas the controls remained at the same low level. Next, we examined whether paired-pulse depression was affected in mutant mice. This presynaptically governed form of short term plasticity is observed when two identical stimuli are delivered to homosynaptic afferent fibers in rapid succession (36Anderson P. Acta Physiol. Scand. 1960; 48: 178-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 37Curtis D.R. Eccles J.C. J. Physiol. 1960; 183: 341-359Google Scholar). In the medial perforant path, the response to the second stimulus is usually depressed by an extent which depends on the interpulse interval (38McNaughton B.L. Brain Res. 1980; 199: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Over the whole range of interpulse intervals (10–500 ms) virtually no difference was observed in paired-pulse depression betweenMas-deficient mice and the normal controls (Fig.5 D). The marked effects on LTP suggest a role of Mas in hippocampus-dependent learning behavior. Therefore, the spatial memory of Mas −/−,Mas +/−, and wild-type mice was tested in the Morris water maze task (39Morris R.G.M. Anderson E. Lynch G.S. Baudry M. Nature. 1986; 319: 774-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (2750) Google Scholar). All experimental groups showed a significant decrease in escape latencies onto a hidden platform over the 3 training days, reaching an asymptotic level of performance on day 3. There were no significant group differences in escape latencies on any day of training (Fig. 6 A) There was a slight, nonsignificant trend toward a better performance of the Mas −/− and Mas +/−animals in the memory retention test on day 4 (probe trial; Fig.6 B). By measuring the distance swum on the search for the removed platform during probe trial, we observed a significantly increased swimming speed of the Mas −/− mice (Fig. 6 C), which might be attributed to different causes including changes in sensomotor function and an increased anxiety. To check on changes in anxiety, all groups were examined in the elevated-plus maze (40Lister R.G. Psychopharmacology. 1987; 92: 180-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The test is based upon the natural aversion of rodents for open spaces. Thus, mice, exposed to the maze, usually prefer the enclosed arms over the open arms.Mas −/− mice entered significantly less often the open arms of the maze and spent less time on this section than did the controls (Fig. 7).Mas +/− mice showed an intermediate behavior, but were not significantly different from either of the two other groups. Anxiety may be confounded with a reduced locomotor activity on the plus maze (41Dawson G.R. Tricklebank M.D. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 33-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar); however, no significant overall group differences were found in total entries on all arms. In conclusion, the behavioral data show a significantly higher level of anxiety inMas-deficient mice. Impairments of sensomotor function, particularly of visuomotor function, which could interfere with the performance in the tests used, were not observed during the experiments. Therefore, the present data suggest a specific behavioral modification in Mas −/− mice. Mas and the closely related product of the Mrg gene have been shown to specifically stimulate intracellular signaling of angiotensin II (10Jackson T.R. Blair L.A. Marshall J. Goedert M. Hanley M.R.

The LCR contains multiple NF-E2 sites (Maf recognition elements, MAREs) that allow the binding of various basic leucine zipper (bZip) proteins like p45 NF-E2, Nrf1, Nrf2, Bach1, and Bach2, in some cases as obligate heterodimers with a small Maf protein. In addition to the bZip domain, the Bach proteins bear a BTB/POZ domain, which has been implicated in the regulation of chromatin structure. We show here that Bach1 is highly expressed in hematopoietic cells and constitutes one of the two MARE-binding activities in murine erythroleukemic (MEL) cells. We further demonstrate that Bach1/MafK heterodimers interact with each other through the BTB domain, generating a multimeric and multivalent DNA binding complex. These results strongly implicate Bach1/MafK heterodimer as an architectural transcription factor that mediates interactions among multiple MAREs. Such a factor could then provide a model for assembly of the theoretical β-globin LCR “holocomplex.” Other BTB domain proteins have already been demonstrated to be involved in remodeling chromatin, and thus this class of proteins likely promote the formation of nucleoprotein complexes required to establish the architecture of regulatory domains.

One of thesecis acting regulatory elements, present in HS-2, -3, and -4, is characterized by a consensus binding site for the transcription factor NF-E2 (10Andrews N.C. Erdjument-Bromage H.

This DNA motif is closely related to the phorbol 12-O-tetradecanoate 13-acetate-responsive element (TRE) and has also been termed a Maf recognitionelement (MARE; Refs. 12Kataoka K. Noda M.

In addition, a specific combination of a MARE and a binding site for GATA factors within HS4 is neccessary to induce DNase I-hypersensitivity (19Stamatoyannopoulos J.A. Goodwin A. Joyce T. Lowrey C.H. EMBO J. 1995; 1995: 106-116Crossref Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These observations suggest an important role for MARE-binding factors in execution of β-globin LCR function. Hematopoietic transcription factor NF-E2 is a heterodimeric factor that consists of a large and a small basic leucine zipper (bZip) subunit and binds to the MAREs (10Andrews N.C. Erdjument-Bromage H.

Several models have been postulated to account for the multiple and complex activities of the β-globin LCR, and observations from various experiments are consistent with the hypothesis that the LCR forms a single, synergistic, and dynamic entity which has been described as the holocomplex (36Bungert J.

Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). While such a model implicitly assumes that DNA-binding proteins interact with one another to establish the underpinning LCR architecture, little is known about protein/protein interactions between LCR-binding factors. Known examples include interactions of GATA-1 with itself, Sp-1, and EKLF (39Crossley M. Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2448-2456Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar, 40Merika M. Orkin S.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2437-2447Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar, 41Yang H.Y. Evans T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1353-1363Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this context, the Bach family proteins may be of particular interest as MARE-binding proteins since they bear a BTB domain (35Oyake T. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Hoshino H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6083-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). BTB domains are found in a variety of different DNA-binding proteins but principally those of the zinc-finger class (42Albagli O. Dhordain P. Deweindt C. Lecocq G. Leprince D. Cell Growth Differ. 1995; 6: 1193-1198PubMed Google Scholar). The biochemical function of this domain is to mediate the formation of homo- and hetero-oligomers (43Bardwell V.J. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1664-1677Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar, 44Chen W. Zollman S. Couderc J. Laski F.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3424-3429Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), and while some of the proteins containing a BTB domain, for example those encoded by trithorax-like(GAGA factor) and E(var)3–93D/mod(mdg4), are clearly involved in the regulation of chromatin structure (45Dorn R. Krauss V. Reuter G. Saumweber H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 11376-11380Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 46Farkas G. Gausz J. Galloni M. Reuter G. Gyurkovics H. Karch F.

Nature. 1994; 367: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar), the function of the BTB domain in this process is still unknown. In light of these facts, we explored the possibility that Bach1 exerts a unique function as a MARE-binding protein. In this report, we first show a close association of Bach1 expression and hematopoiesis and the presence of MARE-binding activity in MEL cells that is composed of Bach1/small Maf heterodimer. We further demonstrate that the presence of the BTB domain allows the Bach1/MafK heterodimer to interact with each other, generating a multimeric and multivalent DNA binding complex. These results strongly suggest that a multivalent DNA binding complex consisting of Bach1/small Maf protein multimers could function as an architecural component of regulatory domains such as a β-globin LCR by binding to its multiple MAREs. Bone marrow mononuclear cells were obtained from 6-week-old female C57BL/6 mice and fractionated as described previously (26Igarashi K. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Matuzaki Y. Nakauchi H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7615-7624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Total RNA was isolated from the sorted bone marrow cells (105 cells/purification) and used for cDNA synthesis. PCR was carried out using primers to amplify β-actin, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT), and bach1(5′-CGGATAATTTCGCTCTCACG-3′ and 5′-TAAAAAGGAAAGCGGGCAGTCGGAG-3′) cDNAs, the amplicon from bach1 genomic DNA being much larger because of the presence of an intron. 2H. Hoshino, A. Muto, and K. Igarachi, unpublished data. All PCR reactions were carried out for 26 and 30 cycles to ensure linearity of amplification. The products were resolved on 2% agarose gels, transferred onto ZetaProbe membranes, and hybridized with radiolabeled DNA fragments specific for each target cDNA. In vitro differentiation of ES cells to hematopoietic cells was carried out according to Nakano's method using OP9 stromal cell line (49Nakano T. Kodama H. Honjo T. Science. 1994; 265: 1098-1101Crossref PubMed Scopus (709) Google Scholar). Flk1+cells were collected using the anti-Flk1 antibody (50Kataoka H. Takamura N. Nishikawa S. Tsuchida K. Kodama H. Kunisada T. Risau W. Kita T. Nishikawa S. Dev. Growth Differ. 1997; 39: 729-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts were prepared from MEL B8 cells or DS19 cells as described previously (51Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2214) Google Scholar). Where indicated, 0.5% Nonidet P-40 was included in the extraction buffer. MEL B8 cells were treated with 1.5% Me2SO for 4 days to induce differentiation. To construct the Bach1-expression plasmid,bach1 cDNA (35Oyake T. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Hoshino H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6083-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) was first modified as follows. ABspHI site was introduced into the translation initiation site by site-directed mutagenesis (5′-GGATGTCT-3′ to 5′-TCATGACT-3′, the translation initiation codon is underlined). This treatment changed the second codon from serine to threonine. In addition, the translation stop codon was changed to aHindIII site (5′-GACGAGTAAACC-3′ to 5′-GACGAGAAGCTT-3′, the translation stop codon in underlined). TheBspHI (blunted)/HindIII fragment was isolated and inserted into pET21b(+) (Novagen) between NdeI (blunted) andHindIII. To construct a plasmid that expresses Bach1 without the BTB domain, a EcoRI (blunted)/HindIII fragment that encodes codons 173 to 739 was isolated from the above plasmid and inserted between the BamHI (blunted) andHindIII sites of pET21b(+). The resulting plasmid, pETBach1ΔBTB, expresses a Bach1 variant (Bach1ΔBTB), lacking the amino-terminal 172 amino acids including the BTB domain, tagged with the T7 epitope at the amino terminus. The MafK-expression plasmid was constructed by inserting FLAG epitope-tagged murine mafKcDNA (31Luna L. Johnsen O. Skartlien A.H. Pedeutour F. Turc-Carel C. Prydz H. Kolsto A. Genomics. 1994; 22: 553-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar) into the NdeI (blunted) site of pET21b(+). Expression plasmids for GAL4 fusions of Bach1 and p45 were constructed as follows using pGBT9 (CLONTECH). The Bach1 cDNA was isolated from the pA1 (35Oyake T. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Hoshino H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6083-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar) as a SalI fragment and inserted in the BamHI site of pGBT9, after filling-in the relevant DNA ends. The entire open reading frame was fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain by this treatment. The p45 cDNA was isolated as an NcoI (overlapping with the start methionine codon)/SalI fragment from the engineered plasmid (21Igarashi K. Kataoka K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) and was inserted in the EcoRI site of pGBT9 after filling in the relevant DNA ends. This treatment fused the amino-terminal 272 amino acid residues of p45 including the transactivation domain. These GAL4 fusion cDNAs were isolated from the respective plasmids asHindIII fragments and transferred to the mammalian expression plasmid pEF-BssHII (27Kataoka K. Igarashi K. Itoh K. Fujiwara K.T. Noda M. Yamamoto M. Nishizawa M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2180-2190Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Recombinant Bach1 proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified using nickel affinity resin (Invitrogen) in the presence of 6 murea. MafK was partially purified by isolating inclusion bodies. Each protein was refolded as described previously (52Igarashi K. Ishihama A. Cell. 1991; 65: 1015-1022Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Purity of the proteins was over 90% for Bach1 and Bach1ΔBTB and roughly 20% for MafK. Maltose-binding protein fusions of Bach1 and p45 were described previously (21Igarashi K. Kataoka K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 35Oyake T. Itoh K. Motohashi H. Hayashi N. Hoshino H. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Igarashi K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6083-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). DNA binding reactions were carried out at 37 °C for 10 min under the conditions described previously (53Kataoka K. Nishizawa M. Kawai S. J. Virology. 1993; 67: 2133-2141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with indicated amounts of proteins in figure legends. For footprinting experiments, binding reactions incorporated treatment with bovine pancreas DNase I (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) after addition of CaCl2 and MgCl2 to 5 and 2.5 mm, respectively, and products were separated on sequencing gels. To compare dissociation of the protein-DNA complexes, a master binding reaction (equivalent to five reactions) was prepared as above, and binding was allowed for 10 min. Then excess amount of oligonucleotide competitor containing the tandem MAREs of HS-2 (21Igarashi K. Kataoka K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) was added to the master reaction, and incubation was continued. At various time points, aliquots were removed and processed for DNase I digestion. For EMSA, separation was on 1% agarose (Fig. 6) or 4% polyacrylamide (Figs. 3,4, and 9) gels. Antisera were included in the binding reactions at 10–20-fold dilution with incubation for 30 min on ice before addition of the probe DNA. The 240-bp HS-2 DNA (26Igarashi K. Itoh K. Motohashi H.

Kataoka K. Itoh K. Hayashi N. Nishizawa M. Yamamoto M. Nature. 1994; 367: 568-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) (0.5 ng) in the presence of either unlabeled CβE or biotinylated CβE oligonucleotide (1 ng). After DNA binding reactions, streptavidine beads (Dynal) were added, and the mixtures were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Streptavidine beads were recovered from the binding reactions using a magnet and washed two times with the binding buffer supplemented with 0.1 m NaCl. The amount of recovered radioactivity was then quantified. Radioactivity recovered with unlabeled CβE oligonucleotide served as the background control. Amounts of proteins used were as follows: Bach1, 150 ng; Bach1ΔBTB, 150 ng; and MafK, 200 ng. Equimolar amounts of Bach1 (1.5 μg) and Bach1ΔBTB (1.3 μg) were incubated with 0.005 or 0.02% of glutaraldehyde on ice for 10 min in 200 μl of phospate-buffered saline containing 1 mm dithiothreitol and 0.05% Tween 20. After adding Tris-HCl, pH 7.0, to 100 mm, the reaction mixtures were concentrated with microcon-10 (Amicon), electrophoresed on sodium dodecyl sulfate, 7.5% polyacrylamide gel, and transferred onto PVDF membranes (Pall). Proteins were detected with an antibody against hexahistidine (Invitrogen). Transfection of MEL DS19 cells was carried out using DOTAP reagent (Boehringer Mannheim). The luciferase reporter plasmid carried the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter and five copies of GAL4 sites. To examine Bach1 expression in normal hematopoietic cells, we isolated RNA from various hematopoietic organs as well as the brains of adult mice. RNA blotting analysis with total RNA preparations clearly indicated thatbach1 is expressed in bone marrow cells and in thymus, as well as in the livers of embryos at day 13.5 post-coitus (Fig.1 A), suggesting a link with active hematopoiesis. To determine the hematopoietic lineage specificity of bach1 expression, we separated hematopoietic cells into various fractions by cell sorting (using antibodies that recognize a variety of hematopoietic lineage markers) and carried out semi-quantitative RT-PCR assays on RNA recovered from these purified cells (Fig. 1 B). bach1 was found to be expressed in Ter-119 (erythroblast and later stages), Mac-1 (mono-macrophage), Gr-1 (granulocyte), B220 (B cells), and CD4/8-double positive (T cells) fractions. Interestingly,bach1 was also expressed in the pure stem cell fraction (Sca-1/c-Kit double-positive, lineage marker-negative, and CD34-negative/low), indicating that its expression in hematopoietic cells commences at an early stage of differentiation and shows little lineage-restriction thereafter. In vitro differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells recapitulates in vivo hematopoiesis and hence provides an excellent system to analyze transcription factor expression during development of hematopoietic cells. One of such systems utilizes a specific stroma cell and can induce efficient hematopoietic cell differentiation in a timed manner, including erythroid lineage. Analysis of Bach1 expression in this system revealed striking induction of Bach1 upon hematopoietic differentiation (Fig.2 A). It should be noted that induction of Bach1 preceded both primitive (εy) and definitive (β-major) globin gene expression.

https://openalex.org/W1995712305,"BAG-1 is a regulator of heat shock protein (Hsp) 70/Hsc70 family proteins that interacts with steroid hormone receptors. The recently identified BAG-1 long (BAG-1L) protein, an isoform of BAG-1 that arises from translation initiation at a noncanonical CUG codon, was co-immunoprecipitated with androgen receptors (AR) from LNCaP prostate cancer cells and other cell lysates, whereas the shorter originally identified BAG-1 and BAG-1M (RAP 46) proteins were not. BAG-1L, but not BAG-1 or BAG-1M (RAP46), also markedly enhanced the ability of AR to transactivate reporter gene plasmids containing an androgen response element (ARE) in PC3 prostate cancer and other cell lines. A C-terminal region deletion mutant of BAG-1L failed to co-immunoprecipitate with AR and functioned as a trans-dominant inhibitor of BAG-1L, impairing AR-induced transactivation of ARE-containing reporter plasmids. In addition, BAG-1L significantly reduced the concentrations of 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) required for AR activity but did not induce ligand-independent transactivation. BAG-1L also markedly improved the ability of AR to transactivate reporter genes when cells were cultured with DHT in combination with the anti-androgen cyproterone acetate. The effects of BAG-1L on AR could not be explained by detectable alterations in the DHT-induced translocation of AR from cytosol to nucleus, nor by BAG-1L-induced increases in the amounts of AR protein. These findings implicate BAG-1L in the regulation of AR function and may have relevance to mechanisms of prostate cancer resistance to hormone-ablative and anti-androgen therapy.

Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in the United States and the second leading cause of cancer-related death among men (1Parker S.L. Tong T. Bolden S. Wingo P.A. CA-Cancer J. Clin. 1997; 47: 5-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (2333) Google Scholar). The normal prostate gland contains a two-layer epithelium composed of a population of small round stem cells called basal cells, which line the basement membrane, and a population of larger differentiated epithelial cells called secretory cells, which secrete a variety of proteins and other substances into the lumen of the gland (2Bonkhoff H. Stein U. Remberger K. Prostate. 1994; 24: 114-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 3Bonkhoff H. Stein U. Remberger K. Hum. Pathol. 1994; 25: 42-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Although both basal and secretory cells contain androgen receptors (AR) 1The abbreviations used are: AR, androgen receptor(s); ARE, androgen response element; DHT, 5α-dihydrotestosterone; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; Hsp, heat shock protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; FCS, fetal calf serum; CPA, cyproterone acetate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CMV, cytomegalovirus. 1The abbreviations used are: AR, androgen receptor(s); ARE, androgen response element; DHT, 5α-dihydrotestosterone; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; Hsp, heat shock protein; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; FCS, fetal calf serum; CPA, cyproterone acetate; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; CMV, cytomegalovirus.

Prostate. 1987; 11: 339-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), only the luminal secretory epithelial cells are dependent on steroid hormone for their function, growth, and survival (4Soeffing W.J. Timms B.G. J. Androl. 1995; 16: 197-208PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of testosterone or related androgens, which can serve as ligands for AR, the secretory cells undergo rapid programmed cell death (6Kyprianou N. Isaacs J.T. Endocrinology. 1988; 122: 552-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Current treatment for metastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate is predicated on the cell death-inducing effects of anti-androgens and hormone-ablative measures, which reduce endogenous production of androgens. However, nearly all hormone-dependent prostate cancers eventually relapse as fatal hormone-independent disease (7Crawford E.D. Eisenberger M.A. McLeod D.C. Spaulding J. Benson R. Dorr F.A. Blumenstein B.A. Davis M.A. Goodman P.J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 321: 419-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (1329) Google Scholar). Multiple, still largely unidentified mechanisms may account for the complete independence or reduced dependence of prostate cancers on androgens (reviewed in Refs. 8Marcelli M. Tilley W.D. Zoppi S.

AR gene deletion or sequestration of the AR from the nucleus to the cytoplasm have been described in some hormone-independent tumors, implying that genetic alterations associated with tumor progression can abrogate the necessity for AR in some cases. However, many tumors may rely on other strategies that allow cancer cells to grow in low concentrations of androgens, including AR gene amplification or overexpression (11Koivisto P. Kononen J. Palmberg C. Tammela T. Hyytinen E. Isola J. Trapman J. Cleutjens K. Noordzij A. Visakorpi T. Kallioniemi O.-P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 314-319PubMed Google Scholar, 12Visakorpi T. Hyytinen E.

FASEB J. 1991; 5: 2910-2915Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Since most hormone-insensitive prostate cancers still retain a wild-type AR, presumably alterations in the factors that control the levels of AR and its function appear to play a major role in resistance to anti-androgen and hormone-ablative therapies. Thus, a need exists to understand more about the molecular mechanisms that govern the activity of AR. Steroid hormones mediate their effects by binding to specific intracellular receptors that act as hormone-dependent transcription factors. Upon binding steroid ligands, the AR undergo a conformational change, translocate to the nucleus, and bind to specific DNA sequences located near or in promoter regions of target genes. After binding DNA, the receptor interacts with components of the basal transcription machinery and sometimes sequence-specific transcription factors, resulting in positive or negative effects on gene transcription (14Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 451-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (2664) Google Scholar, 15Anzick S. Kononen J. Walker R. Azorsa D. Tanner M. Guan X. Sauter G. Kallioniemi O. Trent J. Meltzer P. Science. 1997; 277: 965-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (1415) Google Scholar). A number of proteins have been identified that associate with the inactive or hormone-bound hormone-receptor complexes, including several heat shock family proteins and various types of transcription co-activators (reviewed in Refs. 16Pratt W.B. Welsh M.J. Cell Biol. 1994; 5: 83-93Google Scholar and 17Shibata H. Spencer T.E. Onate S.A. Jenster G. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 1997; 52: 141-164PubMed Google Scholar). However, many details remain unclear as to the molecular mechanisms by which these proteins modulate the activities of steroid hormone receptors, and even less is known about whether alterations in their expression or function might contribute to the deregulation of steroid hormone responses in cancers. Recently, an isoform of the human BAG-1 protein (known as RAP46 (see below)) (18Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 19Zeiner M. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11465-11469Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) has been reported to bind several steroid hormone receptors in vitro, including AR (19Zeiner M. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11465-11469Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). It is unknown, however, what effect if any, BAG-1 has on the functions of these steroid-dependent transcription factors. Interestingly, BAG-1 and its alternative isoform RAP46 were recently shown to bind tightly to heat shock protein (Hsp) 70/Hsc70 family proteins and modulate their chaperone activity in vitro (20Takayama S. Bimston D.N. Matsuzawa S. Freeman B.C. Aime-Sempe C. Xie Z. Morimoto R.J. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4887-4896Crossref PubMed Scopus (433) Google Scholar, 21Zeiner M. Gebauer M. Gehring U. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5483-5490Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 22Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). In this regard, BAG-1 appears to function analogously to bacterial GrpE, stimulating the exchange of ADP for ATP on Hsc70 (22Höhfeld J. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 6209-6216Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). It seems plausible therefore that BAG-1 could alter the bioactivity of AR and other steroid hormone receptors, given that many steroid hormone receptors are constitutively bound to heat shock proteins and that their hormone binding affinity and DNA binding activity can be increased in the presence of Hsp90 and Hsp70, respectively, under some circumstances (23Landel C.C. Kushner P.J. Greene G.L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1407-1419PubMed Google Scholar, 24Fang Y. Fliss A.E. Robins D.M. Caplan A.J. J. Biol.

Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The human and murine BAG-1 proteins are predicted to be amino acids 230 and 219 base pairs in length, respectively, based on cDNA cloning (18Takayama S. Sato T. Krajewski S. Kochel K. Irie S. Millan J.A. Reed J.C. Cell. 1995; 80: 279-284Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (793) Google Scholar, 19Zeiner M. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, recently longer isoforms of the human and mouse BAG-1 proteins have been identified that can arise by translation initiation from noncanonical CUG codons located upstream and in frame with the originally described BAG-1 open reading frames (27Packham G. Brimmell M. Cleveland J.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 28Glass C.K. Rose D.W. Rosenfeld M.G. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 222-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar). This longer isoform of BAG-1 contains a basic motif resembling nuclear localization sequences and preferentially targets to nuclei. The human BAG-1 and BAG-1 long (BAG-1L) proteins migrate as ∼36-kDa and 57–58-kDa proteins, respectively in SDS-PAGE experiments. In addition, a less abundant isoform of BAG-1 that migrates at ∼46–53 kDa has been described and termed either BAG-1M or RAP46. The BAG-1M (RAP46) protein arises from translation initiation at an AUG codon located upstream of the usual start site in the BAG-1 mRNA (27Packham G. Brimmell M. Cleveland J.L. Biochem. J. 1997; 328: 807-813Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). 2S. Takayama, S. Krajewski, M. Krajewska, S. Kitada, J. Zapata, K. Kochel, D. Knee, D. Scudiero, G. Tudor, G. J. Miller, M.

Miyashita, and J. Reed, submitted for publication. BAG-1M (RAP46) is produced in human, but not mouse, cells.2 Like BAG-1, the BAG-1L and BAG-1M proteins also bind to Hsp70 and Hsc70.2 BAG-1 is ubiquitously expressed, whereas BAG-1L is found preferentially in steroid hormone-dependent tissues such as testis, ovary, breast, and prostate.2 Although little is known about the expression of BAG-1 and BAG-1L in cancers, both proteins were detected by immunoblotting in 9 of 9 prostate cancer cell lines tested.2 In this report, we present evidence that the BAG-1L protein may play an important role in the AR signaling pathway, in that it can form complexes with AR and enhance the androgen-dependent transactivation function of this steroid hormone receptor. The plasmids pcDNA3-hu-BAG-1L and pcDNA3-hu-BAG-1 were generated as described previously (26Takayama S. Kochel K. Irie S. Inazawa J. Abe T. Sato T. Druck T. Huebner K. Reed J.C. Genomics. 1996; 35: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar).2 Translation of the longer form (BAG-1L) was forced by mutation of the noncanonical in frame first CTG codon of the cDNA to ATG.2 pcDNA3-BAG-1/BAG-1M lacks the upstream CTG-containing region of the cDNA and encodes both the originally described ∼36-kDa form of BAG-1 and ∼the 46–53-kDa BAG-1M (RAP46) proteins. The plasmid pcDNA3-hu-BAG-1L (ΔC) (lacking the last 47 amino acids of the human BAG-1 protein) was generated by polymerase chain reaction using pcDNA3-BAG-1L as a template and the EcoRI-containing forward primer 5′-GGGAATTCAGTGCGGGCATGGCTC-3′ together with the XhoI containing reverse primer 5′-CCCTCGAGTTATGGCAGGATCAGTGTGTG-3′. After digestion of the polymerase chain reaction product at theEcoRI and XhoI sites, the resulting ∼0.8-kilobase pair fragments were subcloned intoEcoRI/XhoI-digested pcDNA3. pSG5-AR contains the cDNA for the wild-type AR (29Lee H.J. Kokontis J. Wang K.C. Chang C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The reporter pLCI plasmid contains the full-length mouse mammary tumor virus long terminal repeat sequence linked with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) gene (29Lee H.J. Kokontis J.

The human prostate cancer cell lines LN-CaP and PC3, the transformed human embryonal kidney 293, and the monkey kidney COS7 cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). The ALVA31 human prostate cancer cell line was generously provided by Dr. G. Miller (University of Colorado, Denver, CO). Cells were maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 in RPMI 1640 or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (293 and COS7) supplemented with 10% FCS, 3 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Two days prior to experiments, cells were transferred into CT-FCS to reduce background levels of steroids. 5α-Dihydro-testosterone (DHT) (Sigma) and cyproterone acetate (CPA) (Sigma) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide and added to the cultures at a minimum dilutions of 0.0001% (v/v). Control cells received an equivalent amount of solvent only. COS7, PC3, and 293T cells at 60% confluency were transfected by a standard calcium phosphate precipitate method (33Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The medium was replaced with fresh charcoal-treated fetal calf serum/Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium 1 h before transfection. The total amount of plasmid DNA used was normalized to 2.5 μg/well and 8 μg/plate for transfection in 12-well and 6-cm2 plates, respectively, by the addition of empty plasmid. For reporter gene assays, 0.2 μg of a β-galactosidase expression plasmid pCMV-βgal was co-transfected with the CAT reporter gene to normalize the transfection efficiency. Cells were exposed to the precipitate for 5 h at 37 °C. For COS7 and PC3 cells, a glycerol shock was applied. Cells were exposed to 15% glycerol in HBS buffer (25 mm HEPES pH 7.05, 0.75 mm Na2HPO4, 140 mmNaCl) for 4 min. The glycerol was removed by washing three times with PBS and replacement with fresh charcoal-treated fetal calf serum medium. For 293 cells, the medium was replaced without applying a shock. ALVA31 cells were transfected by a lipofection method. Briefly, 1.3 μg of DNA was diluted into 50 μl of Opti-MEM medium (Life Technologies) and combined with 3.3 μl of Lipofectamine (Life Technologies) in 50 μl of Opti-MEM. After incubation for 20 min, 0.35 ml of Opti-MEM was added, and the mixtures were overlaid onto monolayers of cells. After culturing at 37 °C and 5% CO2 for 6 h, 0.45 ml of Opti-MEM containing 20% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum was added to the cultures. At 32–36 h after transfection, cells were stimulated with 0.001–10 nm DHT or 0.1 nm R1881 (ALVA31). Cell extracts were prepared 48 h after transfection. For reporter gene experiments, cells lysates were made as described in Ref. 34Nielsen D.A. Chang T.C. Shapiro D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 19-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar and assayed for CAT and β-galactosidase activity. All transfection experiments were carried out in triplicate, repeated at least three times, and normalized for β-galactosidase activity. For gene expression experiments, cells were washed two times in PBS and lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer (35Reed J.C. Meister L. Tanaka S. Cuddy M. Yum S. Geyer C. Pleasure D. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6529-6538PubMed Google Scholar) containing protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.28 trypsin inhibitory units/ml aprotinin, 50 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 μmbenzamidine, 0.7 μg/ml pepstatin). For protein localization experiments, nuclear and nonnuclear fractions were prepared according to the method of Schreiber et al. (36Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6418Crossref PubMed Scopus (3902) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were collected and washed two times with ice-cold PBS. Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors) and left on ice for 15 min prior to the addition of Nonidet P-40 to 0.6% (v/v) final concentration. After centrifugation, supernatants (cytoplasmic fractions) were collected, and the nuclear pellets were washed twice in the same buffer. Pellets were finally resuspended in buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 25% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 2.5 mmdithiothreitol, protease inhibitors) and vigorously shaken for 10 min, and the postnuclear supernatants were cleared by centrifugation. Fractions were normalized based on the bicinchoninic acid method (Pierce) prior to SDS-PAGE/immunoblot assay. Aliquots containing 25 μg of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE using 10% gels, followed by electrotransfer to Immobilon-P transfer membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). Immunodetection was accomplished using 1:1000 (v/v) of anti-BAG-1 monoclonal antibody ascites (26Takayama S. Kochel K. Irie S. Inazawa J. Abe T. Sato T. Druck T. Huebner K. Reed J.C. Genomics. 1996; 35: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 37Krajewski S. Zapata J.M. Reed J.C. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 236: 221-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar)2 or polyclonal rabbit AR antiserum (Clone AR N20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Barbara, CA), followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Detection was performed using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection method (ECL; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or the Vector SG substrate (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). LN-CaP cells (2 × 107) were collected at 70% confluency and lysed in HKMEN buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 142 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EGTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitors). Cell lysates were passaged several times through a 30½-gauge needle to disrupt the nuclei. Altnernatively, COS7 cells were transiently transfected with AR and BAG-1 expression plasmids, washed several times in PBS, and treated with 1 mm dimethyl-3,3′-dithiobispropionimadate (Pierce) in PBS for 30 min on ice. After extensive washing in ice-cold PBS, cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation buffer containing protease inhibitors. Immunoprecipitations were performed in HKMEN either using the IgG1 anti-BAG-1 monoclonal KS6C8 (26Takayama S. Kochel K. Irie S. Inazawa J. Abe T. Sato T. Druck T. Huebner K. Reed J.C. Genomics. 1996; 35: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)2 or a polyclonal rabbit AR antiserum (clone AR PA1–110 ABR, Inc.) conjugated to protein G-agarose (Zymed, San Francisco, CA). Control immunoprecipitations were performed using IgG1 or rabbit preimmune serum. Immune complexes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE/immunoblot assay using anti-BAG-1 monoclonal antibody with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection method. The human BAG-1M (RAP46) protein had been shown to bind to AR in vitro (19Zeiner M. Gehring U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 11465-11469Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). We therefore asked whether BAG-1 family proteins can influence the transcriptional activity of this steroid hormone receptor. For these experiments, three different cell lines were transiently co-transfected with plasmids encoding various BAG-1 isoforms and AR, together with a ARE-containing CAT reporter plasmid. The cells were then cultured in the presence or absence of DHT. In the presence of hormone, BAG-1 family proteins increased the transcriptional activity of AR in a concentration-dependent manner, with the plasmid producing the BAG-1L protein displaying far more effect than the plasmid encoding for both BAG-1 and BAG-1M (Fig. 1). The extent of BAG-1L-mediated up-regulation of AR-induced transactivation varied among cell lines, with COS7 and PC3 demonstrating as much as ∼ 5-fold increases when transfected with BAG-1L but 293T cells exhibiting only a modest effect. Immunoblot analysis confirmed the production of the BAG-1, BAG-1M, BAG-1L, and AR proteins in the transfected cells and demonstrated production of similar amounts of BAG-1 and BAG-1M compared with BAG-1L (see below for examples). Thus, differences in the relative amounts of BAG-1, BAG-1M, and BAG-1L proteins produced could not account for the greater potency of BAG-1L. The transcription-potentiating effect of BAG-1L was dependent on the addition of androgen to cultures. As shown in Fig.2, AR-mediated transactivation of the ARE-CAT reporter plasmid remained at background levels when cells were co-transfected with plasmids encoding BAG-1 family proteins but cultured in the absence of DHT. However, cells transfected with the BAG-1L-producing plasmid displayed greater sensitivity to androgen compared with control transfected cells or cell over-expressing BAG-1/BAG-1M. The BAG-1L-mediated increases in AR-induced transactivation of the ARE-CAT reporter gene were detected at concentrations as low as 0.01 nm DHT and were substantially higher than control cells or BAG-1/BAG-1M-expressing cells over a broad range of hormone concentrations (0.01- 10 nm). The effects of BAG-1L were dependent on AR, since co-transfections lacking the AR-encoding plasmid failed to result in ARE-CAT plasmid reporter gene transactivation above background levels (not shown). To further examine the specificity of BAG-1L-mediated enhancement of AR transcriptional activity, the effects of BAG-1L on expression of other reporter genes were evaluated. The tumor suppressor p53 was chosen because, by analogy to steroid receptors, p53 is often associated with Hsp90 and Hsp70 in the cytoplasm and must translocate from cytosol to nucleus to exert its transcriptional regulatory action (38Selkirk J.K.

Co-transfection of BAG-1L-encoding expression plasmid into PC3 cells with a p53-producing vector and a p53-RE-CAT reporter gene demonstrated that BAG-1L does not influence p53-mediated transactivation (Fig.3). Similarly, BAG-1L had no effect on the constitutive expression of either a SV40 early region promoter-driven CAT or the CMV immediate early region lacZreporter gene plasmid used for normalizing transfection efficiencies (Fig. 3 and data not shown). These viral promoter/enhancers contain Sp1 binding sites, thus suggesting that BAG-1L does not nonspecifically modulate this family of transcription factors. The observation that BAG-1L increased the sensitivity of AR to its ligand DHT (Fig. 2) prompted us to explore the effects of BAG-1L on the suppression of AR transactivity by the anti-androgen cyproterone acetate. For these experiments, AR and ARE-CAT were transfected into COS7 cells with either pcDNA3 control DNA or an equivalent amount of pcDNA3BAG-1L. The cells were treated ∼1.5 days later with 1 nm DHT alone or in combination with various concentrations of CPA. Relative CAT activity was then measured 12–14 h later. As shown in Fig. 4, CPA reduced in a concentration-dependent manner the DHT-induced transactivation of the ARE-CAT reporter gene plasmid in both control and BAG-1L-transfected COS7 cells. However, because AR-mediated reporter gene transactivation started at higher levels in BAG-1L transfectants, approximately 2 log higher concentrations of CPA androgens were generally required to reduce reporter gene activity to levels comparable with control-transfected cells (Fig. 4). Although BAG-1M (RAP46) has been reported to bind AR in vitro, the interaction of these proteins has not been demonstrated previously in cells. Co-immunoprecipitation assays were therefore performed using lysates prepared from untransfected LN-CaP cells, which constitutively express high levels of the BAG-1, BAG-1M, BAG-1L, and AR proteins (39Veldscholte J. Berrevoets C.A. Mulder E. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1994; 49: 341-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).2 A polyclonal anti-AR antiserum or a preimmune control serum was employed for immunoprecipitations, and the resulting immune complexes were subjected to SDS-PAGE/immunoblot analysis using the anti-BAG-1 monoclonal antibody KS6C8. As a control, BAG-1 proteins were also immunoprecipitated using the same anti-BAG-1 monoclonal antibody. Alternatively, an IgG1 control antibody was employed to confirm specificity. As shown in Fig. 5, the BAG-1L protein was readily detected in association with anti-AR immune complexes (lane 5). In contrast, the BAG-1 and BAG-1M proteins did not co-immunoprecipitate with AR but were found in anti-BAG-1 immune complexes, confirming their presence in LN-CaP cells under these conditions. The specificity of these results was confirmed by the absence of BAG-1 family and AR proteins in immune complexes prepared using IgG1 control monoclonal antibody or the preimmune control serum. Although BAG-1L could be detected in AR-containing immune complexes, the reciprocal experiment involving the use of anti-BAG-1 antibody in attempts to co-immunoprecipitate AR proved unsuccessful. Additional experiments suggested that this was due to antibody-induced disruption of BAG-1L interactions with AR (data not shown). Attempts to determine whether BAG-1L can associate with AR in the absence of steroid hormone have been hampered by the rapid"
https://openalex.org/W2129921047,"Previous structural investigations performed on the lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from the human gastric pathogenHelicobacter pylori have revealed that these cell surface glycan molecules express type 2 partially fucosylated, glucosylated, or galactosylated N-acetyllactosamine O antigen chains (O-chains) of various lengths, which may or may not be terminated at the nonreducing end by Lewis X (Lex) and/or Leyblood group epitopes in mimicry of human cell surface glycoconjugates and glycolipids. Subsequently, serological experiments with commercially available Lewis-specific monoclonal antibodies also have recognized the presence of Lex and Ley blood group antigens in H. pylori but, in addition, have indicated the presence of type 1 chain Lea, Leb, and Led (H-type 1) blood group epitopes in some H. pylori strains. To confirm their presence, structural studies and additional serological experiments were undertaken on H. pylori strains suspected of carrying type 1 chain epitopes. These investigations revealed that the O-chain region of H. pylori strain UA948 carried both Lea(type 1) and Lex (type 2) blood group determinants. The O-chain from H. pylori UA955 LPS expressed the terminal Lewis disaccharide (type 1 chain) and Lex and Ley antigens (type 2). The O-chain of H. pyloriJ223 LPS carried the type 1 chain precursor Lec, the H-1 epitope (Led, type 1 chain) and an elongated nonfucosylated type 2 N-acetyllactosamine chain (i antigen). Thus, O-chains from H. pylori LPSs can also express fucosylated type 1 sequences, and the LPS from a singleH. pylori strain may carry O-chains with type 1 and 2 Lewis blood groups simultaneously. That monoclonal antibodies putatively specific for the Leb determinant can detect glycan substructures (Le disaccharide, Lec, and Led) of Leb indicates their nonspecificity. The expression of both type 1 and 2 Lewis antigens by H. pylori LPSs mimics the cell surface glycomolecules present in both the gastric superficial (which expresses mainly type 1 determinants) and the superficial and glandular epithelium regions (both of which express predominantly type 2 determinants). Therefore, each H. pylori strain may have a different niche within the gastric mucosa, and each individual LPS blood group antigen may have a dissimilar role in H. pyloriadaptation. Previous structural investigations performed on the lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) from the human gastric pathogenHelicobacter pylori have revealed that these cell surface glycan molecules express type 2 partially fucosylated, glucosylated, or galactosylated N-acetyllactosamine O antigen chains (O-chains) of various lengths, which may or may not be terminated at the nonreducing end by Lewis X (Lex) and/or Leyblood group epitopes in mimicry of human cell surface glycoconjugates and glycolipids.

During the past decade, much attention has been directed toward the Gram-negative bacterium Helicobacter pylori and its roles in gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, and gastric malignancies in humans (1Dunn B.E. Cohen H. Blaser M.J. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 10: 720-741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). One class of molecules produced by Gram-negative enteric bacteria are the cell surface lipopolysaccharides (LPSs 1The abbreviations used are: LPS, lipopolysaccharide; Fuc, fucose; DD-Hep,d-glycero-d-manno-heptose; LD-Hep,l-glycero-d-manno-heptose; MS, mass spectrometry; FAB-MS, fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry; Lex, Lewis X (similarly for other Lewis epitopes); LacNAc,N-acetyllactosamine; mAb, monoclonal antibody; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; O-chain, O antigen chain; Hex, hexose; Hep, heptose.

Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1996; 216: 39-81PubMed Google Scholar). In 1994, the first detailed chemical structure of H. pylori LPS showed that the O-chain region ofH. pylori type strain (NCTC 11637) was composed of an elongated partially fucosylated type 2 N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc) polysaccharide covalently attached at the reducing end by a core oligosaccharide and terminated at the nonreducing end by mono-, di-, or trimeric Lewis X (Lex) (β-d-Gal-(1→4)[α-l-Fuc-(1→3)]β-d-GlcNAc-(1→) blood-group epitopes in mimicry of normal human cell surface glycoconjugates and of glycan antigens found in adenocarcinoma tumors (Refs. 3Aspinall G.O. Monteiro M.A. Pang H. Walsh E.J. Moran A.P. Carbohydr. Lett. 1994; 1: 156-165Google Scholar and 4Aspinall G.O. Monteiro M.A. Pang H. Walsh E.J. Moran A.P. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2489-2497Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar; see Fig. 1 for the molecular structure of O-chain and core regions fromH. pylori type strain LPS). Since then, structural studies on other H. pylori strains have revealed the presence of the type 2 Ley(α-l-Fuc-(1→2)-β-d-Gal-(1→4)[α-l-Fuc-(1→3)]β-d-GlcNAc-(1→) determinant in the O-chains of strains P466 (5Aspinall G.O. Monteiro M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2498-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), MO19 (5Aspinall G.O.

Biochem. 1997; 248: 592-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This Ley epitope may terminate an elongated partially fucosylated type 2 LacNAc O-chain polysaccharide as in the cases of strains P466 (5Aspinall G.O. Monteiro M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2498-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and O:3 (6Aspinall G.O. Monteiro M.A. Shaver R.T. Kurjanczyk L.A. Penner J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 592-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) or may be directly connected to the remaining LPS molecule as in strains MO19 (5Aspinall G.O. Monteiro M.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2498-2504Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and O:6 (6Aspinall G.O. Monteiro M.A. Shaver R.T. Kurjanczyk L.A. Penner J.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 248: 592-601Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Recently, the LPS of H. pylori strain UA861 was also found to contain a type 2 LacNAc O-chain polysaccharide, but the lateral fucose was replaced by a glucose unit, and this LPS was terminated by a LacNAc (β-d-Gal-(1→4)-β-d-GlcNAc-(1→) epitope and did not express terminal Lex or Leydeterminants (7Monteiro M.A. Rasko D. Taylor D.E. Perry M.B. Glycobiology. 1998; 8: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). A preliminary account describing the presence of a galactosylated N-acetyllactosamine O-chain in H. pylori strain 471 LPS has also been reported (8Aspinall G.O. Mainkar A.S. Moran A.P. Ir. J. Med. Sci. 1997; 166: 26-27PubMed Google Scholar). This molecular mimicry displayed by H. pylori LPSs with human cell surface molecules, which also express Lex and Ley blood group structures, is now the basis for the hypothesis that there might be an autoimmune component in H. pylori pathogenesis (9Appelmelk B.J. Simoons-Smit I.M. Negrini R. Moran A.P. Aspinall G.O. Forte J.G. Vries T.D. Quan H. Verboom T. Maaskant J.J. Ghiara P. Kuipers E.J. Bloemena E. Tadema T.M. Townsend R.R. Tyagarajan K. Crothers Jr., J.M. Monteiro M.A. Savio A. Graaff J.D. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 2031-2040Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Following the discovery of Lex and Ley blood group epitopes in H. pylori LPSs by chemical analysis, several studies also have detected the presence of these Lewis blood group antigens in many H. pylori strains by employing commercially available monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) (10Sherburne R. Taylor D.E. Infect. Immun. 1995; 63: 4564-4568Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Simoons-Smit I.M. Appelmelk B.J. Verboom T. Negrini R. Penner J.L. Aspinall G.O. Moran A.P. Fei S.F. Bi-Shan S.

Moreover, some of these investigations also have described the presence of type 1 Lewis blood group antigens, such as Lea(β-d-Gal-(1→3)[α-l-Fuc-(1→4)]β-d-GlcNAc-(1→), Leb(α-l-Fuc-(1→2)-β-d-Gal-(1→3)[α-l-Fuc-(1→4)]-β-d-GlcNAc-(1→), and H-type 1 (Led) (α-l-Fuc-(1→2)-β-d-Gal-(1→3)-β-d-GlcNAc-(1→), in some H. pylori strains (11Simoons-Smit I.M. Appelmelk B.J. Verboom T. Negrini R. Penner J.L. Aspinall G.O. Moran A.P. Fei S.F. Bi-Shan S. Rudnica W. Savio A. Graaff J.D. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1996; 34: 2196-2200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Wirth H.-P. Yang M Karita M. Blaser M.J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4598-4605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Chemically based structural studies then were initiated on H. pylori strains suspected of carrying type 1 Lewis antigens (as shown by serology) to confirm the presence of these epitopes in the LPS. These H. pylori strains are strain UA948, which reacted with both Lex and Lea mAbs; UA955, which was recognized by Leb, Ley, and Lex mAbs; and J223, which reacted with a Leb mAb (12Wirth H.-P. Yang M Karita M. Blaser M.J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4598-4605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results from the structural and serological investigations on the LPSs from these H. pylori strains are reported in this paper. Clinical isolates of H. pylori UA948, UA955, and UA1182 were obtained from dyspeptic patients at the University of Alberta Hospital by methods described previously (14Taylor D.E. Hargreaves J.A. Ng L.K. Sherbniuk R.W. Jewell L.D. Am. J. Clin. Pathol. 1987; 87: 49-54Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). These H. pylori strains were frozen immediately after isolation (−70 °C). Cultures were subsequently thawed and plated onto brain heart infusion agar (1.2%, w/v) plates supplemented with 0.5% (w/v) yeast extract and 0.5% (v/v) fetal bovine sera (Hyclone, Logan, UT). These H. pyloristrains were allowed to grow for 3 days under microaerobic conditions at 37 °C, subcultured into BHI broth, and allowed to grow for an additional 3 days under the same conditions with agitation. H. pylori strain J223 was isolated from a duodenal ulcer patient at the Nashville Veterans Affairs Medical Center, and cells were grown as described (12Wirth H.-P. Yang M Karita M. Blaser M.J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4598-4605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). H. pylori strains UA948, UA955, UA1182, and J223 all were determined to be cagA +. The LPSs were isolated by the hot phenol-water extraction procedure (15Westphal O. Jann K. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1965; 5: 83-91Google Scholar). The water-soluble LPSs were purified by gel permeation chromatography on a column of Bio-Gel P-2 (1 m × 1 cm) with water as eluent. In all cases, only one carbohydrate-positive fraction was obtained which eluted in the highM r range (16Dubois M. Gilles K.A. Hamilton J.K. Rebers P.A. Smith F. Anal. Chem. 1956; 28: 350-356Crossref Scopus (41559) Google Scholar). These intact H. pyloriLPSs then were used for chemical, spectroscopic, and serological analyses. Sugar composition analysis was performed by the alditol acetate method (17Sawardeker J.H. Sloneker J.H. Jeanes A. Anal. Chem. 1967; 39: 1602-1604Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis was done in 4 mtrifluoroacetic acid at 100 °C for 4 h followed by reduction in H2O with NaBD4 and subsequent acetylation with acetic anhydride and with residual sodium acetate as the catalyst. Alditol acetate derivatives were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography mass spectrometry using a Hewlett-Packard chromatograph equipped with a 30-m DB-17 capillary column (210 °C (30 min) → 240 °C at 2 °C/min), and MS in the electron impact mode was recorded using a Varian Saturn II mass spectrometer. Enantiomeric configurations of the individual sugars were determined by the formation of the respective 2-(S)- and 2-(R)-butyl chiral glycosides (18Leotein K. Lindberg B. Lonngren J. Carbohydr. Res. 1978; 62: 359-362Crossref Scopus (794) Google Scholar). Methylation linkage analysis was carried out by the NaOH/Me2SO/CH3I procedure (19Ciucanu I. Kerek F. Carbohydr. Res. 1984; 131: 209-217Crossref Scopus (3230) Google Scholar) and with characterization of permethylated alditol acetate derivatives by gas-liquid chromatography mass spectrometry in the electron impact mode (DB-17 column, isothermally at 190 °C for 60 min). A fraction of the methylated sample was used for positive ion FAB-MS, which was performed on a Jeol JMS-AX505H mass spectrometer with glycerol (1Dunn B.E. Cohen H. Blaser M.J. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 1997; 10: 720-741Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): thioglycerol (3Aspinall G.O. Monteiro M.A. Pang H. Walsh E.J. Moran A.P. Carbohydr. Lett. 1994; 1: 156-165Google Scholar) as the matrix. A 6-kV xenon beam was used to produce pseudomolecular ions, which were then accelerated to 3 kV, and their mass was analyzed. Product ion scan (B/E) and precursor ion scan (B2/E) were preformed on metastable ions created in the first free field with a source pressure of 5 × 10−5 torr. The interpretations of positive ion mass spectra of the permethylated LPS derivatives were as described previously by Dell et al. (20Dell A. Azadi P. Thomas-Oates J.E. Jennings H.J. Beurret M. Michon F. Carbohydr. Res. 1990; 200: 59-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). 1H NMR spectra of the water-soluble intact LPSs were recorded on a Bruker AMX 500 spectrometer at 300 K using standard Bruker software. Prior to performing the NMR experiments, the samples were lyophilized three times with D2O (99.9%). The HOD peak was used as the internal reference at δH 4.786. For ELISA experiments on H. pylori strains UA948, UA955, and UA1182, cells were harvested from cultures by centrifugation (5000 × g for 5 min) and washed once with coating buffer (0.01 m sodium carbonate, pH 9.5). The whole cell protein concentration was adjusted to 10 μg/ml and 100 μl of solution and added to each well of a microtiter plate. The microtiter plate was incubated overnight at 4 °C, and then nonadherant cells were removed by washing three times with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.05% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, and 0.004% (w/v) Thimersol (wash buffer). The reaction wells were blocked with blocking buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, containing 2.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, and 0.004% (w/v) Thimersol overnight at 4 °C. The microtiter plates were washed three times with wash buffer and then incubated with the primary antibodies against Lewis antigens. The antibodies used were anti-Lea (mAb BG-5, clone T174), anti-Leb (mAb BG-6, clone T218), anti-Lex (mAb BG-7, clone P12), anti-Ley (mAb BG-8, clone F3). All mAbs were obtained from Signet Laboratories Inc. (Dedham, MA). The primary antibodies were diluted 1:100 in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 1% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20, and 0.004% (w/v) Thimersol for 2 h at 37 °C and washed as described above. The secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution of anti-mouse IgG plus IgM conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Biocan, catalog number 115 035 068, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) was added to the wells and incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C. The microtiter plate was developed at room temperature with 1 mm2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (Sigma, catalog number A-1888), H2O2 (0.03%) in 0.01m citrate buffer (pH 4.2) for 20–30 min with agitation (150 rpm). The reaction was stopped with 4 mm sodium azide, and the absorbance was recorded at 405 nm using a Titretek (Helsinki, Finland) Multiscan MC microtiter plate reader. For the acrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot studies, proteinase K-treated whole cells extracts of H. pyloristrains UA948, UA955, and UA1182 were prepared as described previously by Hitchcock and Brown (21Hitchcock P.J. Brown T.M. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 154: 269-277Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For the LPS analysis, a 15% (w/v) acrylamide separating gel containing urea (Life Technologies, Inc.) and a 5% (w/v) polyacrylamide stacking gel were used. Electrophoresis was conducted with a constant current of 35 mA for 1 h. These gels were either silver-stained according to the method of Tsai and Frasch (22Tsai C.-M. Frasch C.E. Ann. Biochem. 1982; 119: 115-119Crossref Scopus (2322) Google Scholar) or electroblotted onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Micron Separations Inc. Westboro, MA; pore size, 0.22 μm) according to the methods described by Towbin et al. (23Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44969) Google Scholar). Nitrocellulose membranes with transferred LPSs were probed with the antibodies described previously. Anti-Lewis (Signet Laboratories Inc.) antibodies diluted 1:100 were used as the primary antibody, and goat anti-mouse IgG plus IgM conjugated to horseradish peroxidase diluted 1:2000 was the secondary antibody as described above. Reactions were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's specifications, and blots were developed on BioMax film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The LPS from strain J223 was serotyped in ELISA using procedures that have been previously described (9Appelmelk B.J. Simoons-Smit I.M. Negrini R. Moran A.P. Aspinall G.O. Forte J.G. Vries T.D. Quan H. Verboom T. Maaskant J.J. Ghiara P. Kuipers E.J. Bloemena E. Tadema T.M. Townsend R.R. Tyagarajan K. Crothers Jr., J.M. Monteiro M.A. Savio A. Graaff J.D. Infect.

Graaff J.D. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1996; 34: 2196-2200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For serotyping of H. pylori J223, the following mAbs were employed (11Simoons-Smit I.M. Appelmelk B.J. Verboom T. Negrini R. Penner J.L. Aspinall G.O. Moran A.P. Fei S.F. Bi-Shan S. Rudnica W. Savio A. Graaff J.D. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1996; 34: 2196-2200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar): CB-10 and 54.1F6A (both anti-Lex), 1E52 (anti-Ley), 7-Le (anti-Lea), 225-Le (anti-Leb), 4D2 (anti-H type 1), 3–3A (anti-blood group A), and NAM61-1A2 (anti-i antigen) (24Blanchard D. Bernard D. Loirat M.J. Frioux Y. Guimbretiere J. Guimbretire L. Rev. Fr. Transfus. Hemobiol. 1992; 35: 239-254PubMed Google Scholar).H. pylori J223 LPS was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, silver-stained, and immunoblotted as described previously (11Simoons-Smit I.M. Appelmelk B.J. Verboom T. Negrini R. Penner J.L. Aspinall G.O. Moran A.P. Fei S.F. Bi-Shan S. Rudnica W. Savio A. Graaff J.D. J. Clin. Microbiol. 1996; 34: 2196-2200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Polyclonal antisera against the core of LPS of four H. pylori strains were used whose specificity had been determined in a previous study (25Walsh E.J. Moran A. P Ir. J. Med. Sci. 1997; 166: 27Google Scholar). Antisera were raised in rabbits immunized with formalin-treated heat-killed H. pylori strains that expressed rough form LPS lacking O-chain. Following incubation with the relevant primary antibody, the nitrocellulose membranes were washed as described above and incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) and goat anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio-Rad), as appropriate, for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, reactions were visualized with the Bio-Rad premixed enzyme substrate kit (2.5 ml of 4-chloro-1-naphtol in diethylene glycol, 25 ml of Tris-buffered saline, and 15 μl of H2O2) according to the manufacturer's instructions. All chemical, spectroscopic, and serological experiments were performed on intact water-soluble LPS to prevent any aberrant results that might arise due to the inadvertent loss of acid-labile glycose units (such as fucose and sialic acid) that could take place during the standardized mild acetic acid treatment of LPS that is normally used to liberate the polysaccharide from the insoluble lipid A moiety of the LPS molecule. Contrary to LPSs from typical Gram-negative bacteria,H. pylori high M r smooth-form LPSs are soluble in water. The structural studies were performed on the LPSs isolated from the same H. pylori cells with which the serological experiments were carried out. The criteria of Wirth et al. (12Wirth H.-P. Yang M Karita M. Blaser M.J. Infect.

The serological experiments shown in Figs.2 and 3indicated that the LPS from H. pylori strain UA948 expressed both Lea and Lex antigenic determinants.H. pylori strain UA1182, whose LPS expresses a terminal Ley epitope that terminates an O-chain of approximately eight repeating internal Lex units, Ley-[→ Lex-]8 → core → lipid A2, used as a control, was recognized by mAbs to Lex and Ley, as expected. The reactions of the Lex and Lea mAbs were directed at the O-chain region of UA948 LPS as shown by the SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblot profiles (Fig. 2).Figure 3H. pylori whole cell ELISA of strains UA948, UA955, and UA1182. These data suggest that H. pylori UA948 expresses both Le a and Lex antigens;H. pylori UA955 expresses the Leb, Lex, and Ley antigens; and H. pyloriUA1182 expresses Lex and Leyantigens. Only absorbance values over 0.1 atomic unit were considered positive (12Wirth H.-P. Yang M Karita M. Blaser M.J. Infect. Immun. 1996; 64: 4598-4605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Sugar compositional analysis on the water-soluble intact UA948 LPS by the alditol acetate method showed the presence of l-Fuc,d-Glc, d-Gal, d-GlcNAc,d-glycero-d-manno-heptose (DD-Hep), andl-glycero-d-manno-heptose (LD-Hep) in the approximate molar ratio 1:1.4:3.6:3.4:1.5:1.3, respectively. The methylation linkage analysis performed on the intact UA948 LPS (Table I) revealed the presence of the following Lewis blood group-related units, terminal Fuc and Gal, 3-linked Gal, and 4- and 3,4-linked GlcNAc. No 2-linked Gal was detected. Other permethylated alditol acetate derivatives of Glc, Gal, DD-Hep, and LD-Hep were also detected (Table I) and, as shown later, are placed within the core oligosaccharide framework of H. pylori LPS architecture (Fig. 1). To deduce the sequence of the glycose units within the chain, FAB-MS was performed on the methylated intact LPS. The FAB-MS spectrum of the methylated UA948 LPS derivative (Fig. 4 a) showed primary fragment (A-type) glycosyl oxonium ions, from preferential cleavage at the GlcNAc units (20Dell A. Azadi P. Thomas-Oates J.E. Jennings H.J. Beurret M. Michon F. Carbohydr. Res. 1990; 200: 59-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 26Egge H. Peter-Katalinic J. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 1987; 6: 331-393Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and of defined compositions (TableII), at m/z 638 (deoxy-Hex, Hex, HexNAc), m/z 1087 (deoxy-Hex, Hex2, HexNAc2), and at m/z 1261 (deoxy-Hex2, Hex2, HexNAc2). The FAB-MS spectrum also showed two possible secondary fragment ions fromm/z 638, arising from β-elimination of the substituent at O-3 of the branched 3,4-linked GlcNAc unit, those being, m/z402 through loss of terminal Gal-OH (236 atomic mass units), which is a characteristic pattern of the Lea structure (26Egge H. Peter-Katalinic J. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 1987; 6: 331-393Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar), andm/z 432 from the elimination of Fuc-OH (206 atomic mass units), which is associated with the presence of the Lexstructure (26Egge H. Peter-Katalinic J. Mass Spectrom. Rev. 1987; 6: 331-393Crossref Scopus (235) Google Scholar) (Table II). To demonstrate that ions m/z 638, 432, and 402 were in fact related, MS/MS experiments were performed on these ions. Product (parent) ion MS/MS on m/z 638 (Fig.4 b) showed that both m/z 402 and 432 stem fromm/z 638, indicating that m/z 638 represented both terminal Lex and Lea epitopes. Also, whenm/z 402 was subjected to a precursor (daughter) ion MS/MS it showed m/z 638 has its origin, thus confirming the presence of the Gal-1→3-[Fuc-1→4]GlcNAc (Lea) trisaccharide. The higher mass primary ions at m/z 1087 and 1261 and the secondary ion at m/z 1055 (m/z 1087-32 andm/z 1261-206) represent a further type 2 chain extension of the terminal Lewis epitope (638 atomic mass units) by a LacNAc unit (449 atomic mass units), →3-Gal-1→4-GlcNAc-1→, and by an additional internal Lex trisaccharide (623 atomic mass units), respectively (Table II). These data do not differentiate whether the type 2 LacNAc and Lex chain extensions are attached to the type 1 terminal Lea or to the type 2 terminal Lex epitope. No evidence was obtained indicating that a type 1, →3-Gal-1→3-GlcNAc-1→, chain extension existed, nor could prominent m/z ions, which would have pointed toward a connection of the Lex/a → LacNAc and Lex/a→ Lex regions to units of the core be detected. However, one dominant A-type primary fragment ion of defined composition and that must include one heptose residue in addition to a terminal Lewis trisaccharide was seen at m/z 886 (deoxy-Hex, Hex, Hep, HexNAc) (Fig. 4 a). Since there were no terminal heptose and no 2-substituted galactose derivatives detected, this primary ion must originate from cleavage at the heptosyl glycosidic bond to give Gal→[Fuc→]GlcNAc→Hep+. Either the terminal Lea or Lex antigen may be attached to this heptose core-related unit. The primary fragment ion m/z886 has also been observed in previous FAB-MS experiments with otherH. pylori strains, that showed the attachment of the first Lex O-chain repeating unit to the core oligosaccharide (4Aspinall G.O.

The 1H NMR spectrum of the intact UA948 LPS confirmed the presence of several Fuc residues (6CH3, δ 1.15–1.4) and GlcNAc (COCH3, δ 2.02 s) units. These structural and serological studies were consistent in showing that the O-chain of the LPS from H. pylori UA948 carried type 1 Lea and type 2 Lex terminal epitopes, which may be extended by a further LacNAc or internal Lex units (Table II).Table ISugar linkage analyses of the intact LPSs of H. pylori UA948, UA955, and J223 showing approximate molar ratiosLinkage typeUA948 LPSUA955 LPSJ223 LPSLewis blood group units (O-Chain) Fucp-(1→1.541 Galp-(1→111 →2)-Galp-(1→011 →3)-Galp-(1→345 →3)-GlcpNAc-(1→001.5 →4)-GlcpNAc-(1→214 →3,4)-GlcpNAc-(1→130Core units Glcp-(1→111 →4)-Galp-(1→111 →3)-Glcp-(1→111 →7)-DD-Hepp-(1→111 →2,7)-DD-Hepp-(1→111 →2)-LD-Hepp-(1→111 Open table in a new tab Table IIInterpretation of the ions from the FAB-MS spectrum of methylated intact H. pylori UA948 LPSPrimary ionsSecondary ionsProposed structurem/zm/z638402 (638 − 236)Fuc-→4-GlcNAc+ 3 ↑ (Lea, type 1 chain) Gal-1638432 (638 − 206)Gal-1→4-GlcNAc+ 3(Lex, type 2 chain) ↑ Fuc-1886Gal-1→4/3-GlcNAc-1→Hep+3/4↑ (Lea/x→Hep)Fuc-110871055 (1087 − 32)Gal-1→4/3-GlcNAc-1→3-Gal-1→4-GlcNAc+3/4↑ (Lea/x→LacNAc)Fuc-112611055 (1261 − 206)Gal-1→4/3-GlcNAc-1→3-Gal-1→4-GlcNAc+3/4 3↑ ↑Fuc-1 Fuc-1(Lea/x→Lex) Open table in a new tab The whole cell ELISA (Fig. 3) study performed on H. pylori UA955 suggested the presenc"

We find that insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 is 2-fold more concentrated in the intracellular membrane (IM) compartment than in cytosol, whereas IRS-2 is 2-fold more concentrated in cytosol than in IM. Insulin stimulation induces rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of both IRS-1 and IRS-2. This occurs mainly in the IM compartment, even though IRS-2 is located predominantly in cytosol. Furthermore, after insulin stimulation, both IRS-1 and IRS-2 translocate from IM to cytosol with at½ of 3.5 min. Using an in vitro reconstitution assay, we have demonstrated an association between IRS-1 and internal membranes and have shown that the dissociation of IRS-1 from IM is dependent on serine/threonine phosphorylation of IM. By comparison, within 1 min after insulin stimulation, 40% of the total pool of the 85-kDa subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (p85) is recruited from cytosol to IM, the greater part of which can be accounted for by binding to IRS-1 present in the IM. The p85 binding and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity associated with IRS-2 rapidly decrease in both IM and cytosol, whereas those associated with IRS-1 stay at a relatively high level in IM and increase with time in cytosol despite a return of p85 to the cytosol and decreasing tyrosine phosphorylation of cytosolic IRS-1. These data indicate that IRS-1 and IRS-2 are differentially distributed in the cell and move from IM to cytosol following insulin stimulation. Insulin-stimulated IRS-1 and IRS-2 signaling occurs mainly in the IM and shows different kinetics; IRS-1-mediated signaling is more stable, whereas IRS-2-mediated signaling is more transient.

This complex array of signaling molecules not only participates in different parts of the insulin action cascade but also shows different distributions and patterns of movement within the cell.

However, it is not clear why IRS-1 associates with internal membranes nor whether this feature of membrane association could be observed for other substrates. Likewise, little is known about intracellular trafficking of these molecules that might occur following insulin stimulation. Such movement and compartmentalization could play a role not only in activation of PI 3-kinase but also in activation of the Ras signaling pathway and the various serine/threonine kinases that are stimulated by insulin. In the present study, we have characterized the kinetics and differential subcellular localization of insulin signaling molecules, including IRS-1, IRS-2, and PI 3-kinase, in order to better understand the role of spatial distribution in insulin signaling, and we have studied the effects of serine/threonine phosphorylation on this process. Insulin was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Polyclonal anti-IRS-1 and anti-IRS-2 were prepared as described previously (21Bruning J.C. Winnay J. Cheatham B. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 1513-1521Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antibodies to Ras and the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase, monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (4G10), and protein phosphatase type-2A (14-111) were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (New York, NY). Polyclonal anti-Shc, anti-mSOS, and monoclonal anti-Grb2 were purchased from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-Akt was a gift of Dr. T. F. Franke. Anti-Gab-1 was a gift of Dr. D. Burks (Joslin Diabetes Center, Boston, MA). 3T3-L1 fibroblasts were maintained and differentiated using isobutylmethylxanthine, dexamethasone, and insulin as described previously (22Frost S.C. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2646-2652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The adipocytes were used 10 days after the initiation of differentiation, by which time >90% of the cells had obtained an adipocyte morphology. Differentiated 3T3-L1 cells in 10-cm dishes were serum-starved for 18 h before experiments. For stimulation, cells were treated with 10−7m insulin for the indicated times, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate buffered saline, and immediately homogenized using 26 strokes of a 1-ml Teflon-glass homogenizer in a buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 255 mm sucrose, 1 mmNa3VO4, 50 nm okadaic acid, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin. In some experiments, 1 mm Na3VO4 and/or 50 nm okadaic acid were omitted from the homogenization buffer to allow dephosphorylation to occur. The homogenized cells were then subjected to subcellular fractionation as described previously to isolate plasma membranes, intracellular membranes, and cytosol (23Simpson I.A. Yver D.R. Hissin P.J.

Chem. 1990; 265: 12434-12443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein concentration of these fractions was measured using the Bradford method. For immunoprecipitation, subcellular fractions were solubilized in the above-mentioned homogenization buffer supplemented with 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40. After centrifugation, supernatants were normalized for protein concentration and subjected to immunoprecipitation. Lysates were incubated with primary antibody for 2 h at 4 °C and with protein A-Sepharose beads for additional 1.5 h, followed by three washes with lysis buffer before elution into SDS-PAGE sample buffer. The samples were then loaded onto a SDS-polyacrylamide gel and subjected to electrophoresis. Under the conditions used, our anti-IRS-1 precipitates about 90% of IRS-1 and virtually no IRS-2, whereas the anti-IRS-2 precipitates only about 37% of IRS-2 and about 7% of the IRS-1 (data not shown). For immunoblotting, equal amounts of protein (10–50 μg) were subjected to SDS-PAGE and electroblotted to nitrocellulose filters. The filters were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and then incubated with the appropriate antibody, washed, reacted with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG coupled to peroxidase, and developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents as instructed by the manufacturer (NEN Life Science Products). The signals on the blot were quantified by densitometry. For PI 3-kinase assays, lysates of subcellular fractions were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-p85, anti-IRS-1, or anti-IRS-2 for 15 h followed by incubation with protein A-Sepharose for an additional 1.5 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed and subjected to the in vitro PI 3-kinase assay as described previously (25Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 4902-4911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1001) Google Scholar). Intracellular membranes and cytosol were prepared from cells stimulated with or without 10−7m insulin for 10 min in homogenization buffer without or with phosphatase inhibitors (1 mmvanadate and/or 50 nm okadaic acid). The resulting pellet of the intracellular membranes was resuspended with cytosol from an equivalent number of either basal or insulin-stimulated cells prepared in homogenization buffer without or with phosphatase inhibitors. Each assay tube contained fractions from cells in one 10-cm dish in a total volume of 100 μl. The suspension was incubated for 30 min at 30 °C, after which intracellular membranes were reisolated by centrifugation at 200,000 × g for 1 h. IRS-1 in the resulting intracellular membranes was detected with immunoblotting with anti-IRS-1 antibody. In the study using protein phosphatase 2A, intracellular membranes were suspended in the homogenization buffer without phosphatase inhibitors, supplemented with 10 mmMgCl2, and then incubated with protein phosphatase 2A at 30 °C for 30 min. After the incubation, cytosol from an equivalent number of cells was added to the mixture, and the mixture was incubated at 30 °C for a further 30 min, followed by centrifugation to reisolate the intracellular membranes. Fig. 1 Ashows the subcellular distribution of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins induced by insulin stimulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes as determined by subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting with anti-phosphotyrosine. As described previously, tyrosine phosphorylation of the β-subunit of the insulin receptor (95 kDa) was maximally induced 1 min after insulin stimulation in the plasma membrane (PM) and slightly decreased during the 10-min time course. A trace of the phosphorylated insulin receptor was also observed in the intracellular membrane (IM). Whether this represents internalized insulin receptor or a small contamination of the IM with PM is unclear. The tyrosine-phosphorylated 52-kDa isoform of Shc was also recovered in the PM. Under the conditions of this experiment and in 3T3-L1 cells, the phosphorylation of this Shc isoform was observed in the basal state and was increased by about 30% following stimulation with insulin. Tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 and IRS-2 migrate as a broad band at ∼185 kDa and were apparent in the IM and cytosol, but not in the PM. By scanning densitometry, insulin-induced phosphorylation of IRS-1/2 was 3-fold higher in the IM than in cytosol when normalized for protein amount, reached a peak at 1 min, and decreased thereafter with time in both the fractions (Fig.1 B). The level at which other insulin receptor substrates are present in 3T3-L1 cells is not known; however, a small amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated protein was observed in the PM at 60 kDa, which may represent IRS-3 (5Lavan B.E.

To further analyze the insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of pp185, both cytosol and IM were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-IRS-1 or anti-IRS-2 followed by immunoblot analysis of the immunoprecipitates with anti-phosphotyrosine. In agreement with Sunet al. (27Sun X.J. Pons S. Wang L.M. Zhang Y. Yenush L. Burks D. Myers Jr., M.G. Glasheen E. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Pierce J.H. White M.F. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), anti-IRS-1 precipitated over 90% of the total pp185 band, indicating that in 3T3-L1 cells IRS-1 is the predominate substrate of the insulin receptor (data not shown). Tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 was maximal in IM within 1 min of insulin stimulation and declined slowly over 10 min (Fig. 1 C). IRS-2 phosphorylation in the IM also peaked at 1 min after stimulation, but in contrast to IRS-1, IRS-2 phosphorylation declined rapidly. In the cytosol, phosphorylation of both IRS-1 and IRS-2 was rapid but transient, peaking at 1 min and then declining to near basal levels by 4 min. Maximal phosphorylation of these two proteins in the cytosol was much lower, being 30 and 10% of the IM level for IRS-1 and IRS-2, respectively. Because IRS-1 contributes to most of the tyrosine-phosphorylation of pp185, we could calculate the apparent stoichiometry of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in individual fractions at each time point (Fig. 1 E). Despite the relative abundance of IRS-1 in the IM, the stoichiometry of phosphorylation was similar in both the IM and cytosol at 1 min after insulin stimulation. Interestingly, in the IM, the stoichiometry continued to increase with time, whereas that in cytosol declined by more than 50%. This suggests that tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 in IM dissociates to cytosol and is then dephosphorylated, rather than both effects occurring in both compartments. To determine whether the compartmentalization of phosphorylation was due to a difference in substrate protein localization or to a preferential use of the IM fraction as a substrate, the subcellular distribution of IRS-1, IRS-2, and p85 proteins was analyzed before and after insulin stimulation (Fig. 2 A). For this analysis, equal amounts of protein were loaded in each lane of the SDS-PAGE gel, although the protein distribution in the subcellular fractions was 60, 25, and 15% of the total protein recovered for cytosol, IM, and PM, respectively. When measured at equal protein amounts and in the absence of insulin stimulation, the relative concentration of IRS-1 was approximately 2-fold higher in the IM than in cytosol. Corrected for total protein distribution, this indicates that about 50% of the total IRS-1 is in the IM and about 50% in the cytosol. IRS-2 was also recovered in both IM and cytosolic fractions, but in contrast to IRS-1, the concentration of IRS-2 was 2-fold higher in the cytosol, indicating that 75–80% of this protein is cytosolic. Almost no IRS-1 or IRS-2 was recovered in the PM. Following insulin stimulation, the content of IRS-1 and IRS-2 in the IM declined rapidly with concomitant increases in the cytosol, consistent with previous reports (12Heller-Harrison R.A. Morin M. Czech M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24442-24450Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 13Ricort J.M. Tanti J.F. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand Brustel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase was also recovered in both IM and cytosol and was predominantly cytosolic in the basal state. Following insulin stimulation, there was a 2.5–3-fold increase in p85 in the IM and a concomitant decrease of 50% in cytosol by 1 min, with a gradual return toward the basal state (Fig. 2 A, right panel). The amount of p85 recruited from cytosol to IM represents about 40% of the total p85. p85 docking to IRS-1 and IRS-2 in the IM and cytosol paralleled the phosphorylation of these proteins (see Figs. 1, C andD, and 2 A). Essentially no p85 was recovered in the PM. The subcellular distribution of PI 3-kinase activity associated with IRS-1, IRS-2, and p85 is shown in Fig. 2 B. IRS-1-associated activity increased by 10–20-fold 1 min after insulin stimulation in both the IM fraction and cytosol, with the greatest increase observed in the IM. This reflects the distribution and tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 protein (Figs. 1 C and 2 B). IRS-2-associated activity also increased after insulin stimulation by 5–15-fold. Interestingly, the greatest increase was again predominantly in the IM. This is consistent with the fact that, despite the higher concentration of IRS-2 in the cytosol, the highest level of phosphorylation of IRS-2 occurs in the IM. p85-associated PI 3-kinase activity increased in the IM after insulin stimulation in parallel with the change in p85 protein but did not change in cytosol despite the decrease of p85 protein. A small but detectable amount of p85-associated PI 3-kinase activity was also recovered in the PM fraction, although very little p85 protein was recovered in this compartment. Approximately 75% of the total p85 protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-p85. Interestingly, the same antibody immunoprecipitated approximately 90% of the total pp185 band (i.e. tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1/2); however, this accounted for only 13 and 3% of the total IRS-1 and IRS-2, respectively (data not shown). These data indicate that less than 15% of total IRS-1 was tyrosine-phosphorylated 1 min after insulin treatment, and this accounts for the majority of the high molecular weight tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates and most of the activation of PI 3-kinase in 3T3-L1 cells. The PI 3-kinase activity associated with IRS-1 and IRS-2 demonstrated somewhat different patterns than the tyrosine phosphorylation of these proteins (Fig. 3). IRS-1-associated PI 3-kinase in the IM was maximally stimulated by insulin at 1 min after stimulation and remained high in this fraction for the 10 min of study, perhaps due to the high stoichiometry of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in IM. Cytosolic PI 3-kinase activity associated with IRS-1 increased by more than 10-fold at 1 min and continued to rise gradually. This effect may be due to the translocation of some tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 from IM to cytosol. By comparison, PI 3-kinase associated with IRS-2 was maximal at 1 min after insulin stimulation in both IM and cytosol, and then declined rapidly with time in both the fractions. In addition to activation of PI 3-kinase, IRS-1 and IRS-2 are potentially involved in the Ras signaling pathway by recruiting Grb2. Grb2 was detected in all cellular fractions, with the highest relative concentrations in the IM and cytosol in the unstimulated state (Fig. 4 A). Insulin-induced changes in the subcellular distribution of Grb2 with a 2-fold increase in both PM and IM and a 2-fold decrease in cytosol at 1 min. The changes in Grb2 in the PM and cytosol remained constant over 10 min, whereas the content of Grb2 in IM declined after 1 min of insulin stimulation, a pattern similar to that observed for p85. All three forms of Shc (46, 52, and 66 kDa) could be detected in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, with the 52-kDa form being predominant (Fig.4 B). Under basal conditions, the highest concentration of Shc was in the cytosol, followed by IM and PM. Upon insulin treatment, the 52-kDa isoform of Shc was recruited to the PM with a 3-fold increase by 4 min of stimulation. This was associated with a slight decline in the Shc content in cytosol. Surprisingly, immunoreactive mSOS was recovered almost exclusively in IM, where the concentration of Grb2 is highest, rather than in the PM, where the concentration of Ras is highest (Fig. 4 C). Neither the subcellular distribution of mSOS nor the distribution of Ras was changed by insulin stimulation. Likewise, Akt, one of the serine kinases downstream of PI 3-kinase (28Antonetti D.A. Algenstaedt P. Kahn C.R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 2195-2203Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar,29Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1996; 85: 621-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar), was recovered exclusively in cytosol, and its distribution was not changed by insulin stimulation (Fig. 4 C). Gab-1, which has PH and PTB domains and serves as a potential substrate of the insulin receptor (4Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar), was also recovered exclusively in cytosol (Fig.4 C). Following insulin stimulation, the mobility of Gab1 appeared to decrease, and there was a dramatic reduction in the signal detected in immunoblots. The exact cause of this decrease is unclear, but it could be related to a change in immunoreactivity, a rapid degradation, or a sequestration in an insoluble compartment, such as the cytoskeleton. From the preceding experiments, it was clear that insulin induced a rapid translocation of IRS-1 from IM to cytosol. This raised the question as to whether there was an insulin-stimulated change in IRS-1 or a change in the IM environment that induces a dissociation of IRS-1. To address this question, we developed an in vitro IRS-1 reassociation assay. IM from control or insulin-treated cells was prepared in the absence or presence of phosphatase inhibitors. The IM was then mixed with cytosol from control or insulin-treated cells prepared in the absence or presence of phosphatase inhibitors. After incubation for 30 min at 30 °C, the IM was reisolated by centrifugation, and the associated IRS-1 and the tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. Fig. 5 A shows the reassociation assay. First, note that by immunoblotting with anti-IRS-1 and anti-phosphotyrosine, three species of IRS-1 were detected, depending upon the source of the IM (either basal or insulin-stimulated) and whether the cytosol was prepared in the presence (ICy+) or absence (ICy−) of phosphatase inhibitors. These forms of IRS-1 demonstrated progressively reduced mobility on SDS-PAGE and are indicated as IRS-1, IRS-1*, and IRS-1**, respectively. The heterogeneity of migration of IRS-1 results from increasing levels of tyrosine and/or serine/threonine phosphorylation. In the insulin-stimulated cytosol (Fig. 5 A, lane 7, ICy+), the predominant form was IRS-1*, whereas in the basal IM, the predominant form was IRS-1, although some IRS-1* and IRS-1** could be detected (lane 1). As we have previously shown, insulin induces dissociation of IRS-1 from IM; thus, there was a reduced amount of IRS-1 protein in IM from insulin-stimulated cells. However, the predominant form of the IRS-1 protein was the slowest migrating,i.e. IRS-1**, and therefore presumably the most heavily phosphorylated (Fig. 5 A, lane 4). Following incubation of basal IM with insulin-stimulated cytosol (prepared in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors; Fig. 5,ICy+), there was an association of IRS-1* and IRS-1** from the cytosolic fraction with the basal IM (Fig.5 A, lane 2). The incubation of insulin-stimulated IM with insulin-stimulated cytosol resulted in a lower level of IM-associated IRS-1 protein (Fig. 5 A, lane 5). In contrast, when this experiment was performed with insulin-stimulated IM prepared in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors, the IRS-1 present in the cytosol associated with the IM (Fig. 5 B). These data suggest that an insulin-regulated event in the IM is, at least in part, responsible for the insulin-induced dissociation of IRS-1 from the IM. Furthermore, this insulin-stimulated event is most likely a phosphorylation of an IM protein(s), rather than phosphorylation of IRS-1. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that when IM was prepared in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors, no significant changes in IRS-1 content in IM were observed (Fig.5 B, lanes 1 and 4). Furthermore, the IMs prepared from insulin-treated cells were able to associate with IRS-1* and IRS-1** from insulin-stimulated cytosol prepared in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors (Fig.5 B, lanes 3 and 6). These data support the notion that a phosphorylation event in the IM is important for IRS-1 dissociation. To address the question of whether tyrosine or serine/threonine phosphorylation in IM was responsible for the dissociation event, IM was prepared in the absence or presence of vanadate or okadaic acid or both. As shown in Fig. 6 A, the insulin-induced dissociation of IRS-1 from the IM was observed in membranes that were prepared in the presence of okadaic acid with or without vanadate; however, this effect was not fully preserved in the presence of vanadate without okadaic acid. These observations are consistent with a serine/threonine phosphorylation event in IM responsible for the dissociation of IRS-1. By comparison, the insulin-induced decrease of IRS-2 in IM was observed even if the membranes were prepared without okadaic acid or vanadate, indicating that the lower level of association of IRS-2 with IM may depend on a mechanism different from phosphorylation. To further confirm the serine/threonine phosphorylation dependence of IRS-1 dissociation, IM was first treated with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) in the presence or absence of okadaic acid and/or vanadate and then incubated with insulin-stimulated cytosol (Fig. 6 B). Although the incubation in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors alone allowed some IRS-1 to associate with IM, treatment with PP2A markedly restored the association of IRS-1 with the IM. This effect of PP2A was prevented by okadaic acid but not by vanadate. These data are consistent with a serine/threonine phosphorylation event in the IM that modulates the IRS-1/IM interaction. Following insulin binding to its receptor, the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase is rapidly activated and phosphorylates substrate proteins, including IRS-1 and IRS-2 (1Kahn C.R. Diabetes. 1994; 43: 1066-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have analyzed the compartmentalization of these two major insulin receptor substrates following insulin stimulation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes and characterized the early signaling to PI 3-kinase. It has been previously noted by several investigators (10Kublaoui B. Lee J. Pilch P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 59-65Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 12Heller-Harrison R.A. Morin M. Czech M.P. J. Biol.

J. 1996; 318: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) and confirmed by the present study that IRS-1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated preferentially in the IM compartment and that there is a redistribution to the cytosol following insulin treatment. This suggests that the subcellular localization of signals might be important for the diversity and specificity in signal transduction. Indeed, the fact that activation of PI 3-kinase occurs at the plasma membrane following stimulation of cells by PDGF as opposed to occurring in the intracellular membranes following insulin stimulation has lead to the hypothesis that subcellular localization of PI 3-kinase may explain the different consequences of PDGF and insulin stimulation of PI 3-kinase on glucose transport (13Ricort J.M. Tanti J.F. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand Brustel Y. Eur. J. Biochem. 1996; 239: 17-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 16Nave B.T. Haigh R.J. Hayward A.C. Siddle K. Shepherd P.R. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). In the current work, we find that tyrosine phosphorylation of not only IRS-1 but also IRS-2 occurs mainly in the intracellular membrane compartment with relatively low levels in cytosol, implying a localization of signaling by both of these substrates of the insulin receptor. The preferential tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 is explained in part because IRS-1 is located preferentially in the intracellular membranes. However, this cannot explain the increased phosphorylation of IRS-2 in IM, because IRS-2 is preferentially localized in cytosol. Indeed, the total amount of IRS-2 associated with the intracellular membrane is <25% of the total cellular pool, but this fraction accounts for >85% of the tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-2. This differential localization of IRS-1 and IRS-2 may explain, in part, why IRS-2 contributes less to tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS proteins and p85 association than IRS-1 in 3T3-L1 cells. Because insulin receptors are never recovered in the same membrane fraction as the majority of phosphorylated IRS-1 and IRS-2, an interesting question is how these substrates become phosphorylated. Although it is possible that the IRS proteins become phosphorylated in cytosol and then bind to IM, no such translocation was observed. This suggests that another mechanism must exist by which insulin receptors preferentially phosphorylate IRS-1 and IRS-2 already present in the IM compartment. One possible explanation is that some fraction of the IM vesicles are located in close proximity to the plasma membrane. This would permit the important N-terminal regions of IRS-1 and IRS-2 containing the PH and PTB domains access to the juxtamembrane portion of the insulin receptor and facilitate subsequent phosphorylation (17Myers Jr., M.G. Grammer T.C. Brooks J. Glasheen E.M. Wang L.-M. Sun X.J. Blenis J. Pierce J.H. White M.F. J. Biol.

Cell. 1996; 85: 695-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Despite this possibility, only about 15% of IRS-1 and even less IRS-2 was tyrosine-phosphorylated by 1 min after insulin stimulation (the time of maximal tyrosine phosphorylation), perhaps reflecting the large cytosolic pools of these proteins. The ability of the p85 subunit of PI 3-kinase to bind to IRS protein generally parallels the level of tyrosine phosphorylation in subcellular fractions. Thus, p85 association with IRS-1 is greater than that with IRS-2. Also, p85 association to both IRS-1 and IRS-2 is greater in the IM than in cytosol. This results in an insulin-stimulated recruitment of p85 from cytosol to the IM. The return of p85 from the IM to the cytosol several minutes post-insulin stimulation may be the result of the translocation of IRS-1 and IRS-2 from the IM to cytosol and the concomitant decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of these substrates. Because the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 in the IM is relatively stable over the first 10 min following stimulation with insulin (despite a progressive decrease in IRS-1 protein), we can conclude that the apparent stoichiometry of IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in the IM must be increasing, whereas that in cytosol is decreasing. This suggests that the activated insulin receptors continue to phosphorylate IRS-1 in the IM, leading to a continuous recruitment of p85 to the IM. Although the tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS-1 translocated to cytosol undergoes a relatively rapid dephosphorylation, the PI 3-kinase associated with IRS-1 in cytosol remains relatively stable over 10 min. This suggests that the dephosphorylation of IRS-1 in cytosol may preferentially occur at sites other than PI 3-kinase binding sites (data not shown). By comparison, the phosphorylation of IRS-2 and its docking to PI 3-kinase decrease rapidly both in the IM and cytosol following insulin stimulation. This is consistent with the recent report that tyrosine phosphorylation and PI 3-kinase association of IRS-2 are more transient than those of IRS-1 in L6 cells (30Ogihara T. Shin B.-C. Anai M. Katagiri H. Inukai K. Funaki M. Fukushima Y. Ishihara H. Takata K. Kikuchi M. Yazaki Y. Oka Y. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12868-12870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The ability of IRS-1 to associate with the IM and have a higher stoichiometry of tyrosine-phosphorylation and the possible relative resistance to dephosphorylation of IRS-1 at the PI 3-kinase binding sites result in a greater contribution of IRS-1 to insulin-stimulated PI 3-kinase in both the IM and cytosol. A working model of the dynamics of IRS protein movement in response to insulin is depicted in Fig. 7. The most important aspect of the current study is the ability to reconstitute the association of IRS-1 to IM in vitro. Results from these experiments suggest that the translocation of IRS-1 from the IM to cytosol is due to a decreased ability of the IM to associate with IRS-1 and is regulated by an insulin-induced serine/threonine phosphorylation of some component in the IM. Thus, the IM from insulin-stimulated cells has a decreased ability to associate with IRS-1. This is true whether the IRS-1 is obtained from basal or insulin-stimulated cells and whether or not the IRS-1 is tyrosine- or serine/threonine-phosphorylated (as judged by both immunoblotting and gel mobility). We also noted that exclusion of okadaic acid from the homogenization buffer (which allows dephosphorylation of serine/threonine residues in the IM) prevents the dissociation of IRS-1. Likewise, treatment of the insulin-stimulated IM with PP2A restores its ability to associate with IRS-1. It has been suggested that the association between membranes and IRS-1 most likely involves the PH and PTB domains of IRS-1, because these domains are capable of many protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions (29Lemmon M.A. Ferguson K.M. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1996; 85: 621-624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Addition of a recombinant IRS-1 fragment containing only the PH and PTB domains in the reconstitution assay had no effect on IRS-1 interaction with the IM (data not shown). Although this does not rule out a role for the PH/PTB region in interacting with IM, it does suggest that the recombinant protein alone is insufficient to compete with endogenous IRS-1 for association with IM. Further studies will be needed to define the region of IRS-1 responsible for association with the IM and to detect the possible IRS-1 binding component(s) present in the IM. The dissociation of IRS-2 from IM appears to be modulated differently because it occurs even in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors. We also examined the location of Grb2, Shc, mSOS, and Ras as components of the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and Akt as a downstream signaling partner of PI 3-kinase (31Franke T.F.

Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar). Gab-1, which has a PH domain (4Holgado-Madruga M. Emlet D.R. Moscatello D.K. Godwin A.K. Wong A.J. Nature. 1996; 379: 560-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar) and has been reported to be an insulin receptor substrate in some cells, is exclusively in the cytosol of 3T3-L1 cells. Furthermore, Gab 1 is not tyrosine-phosphorylated, nor does it change subcellular location upon insulin stimulation. Insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc was observed exclusively in the plasma membrane, and this was associated with a minor translocation of the 52-kDa isoform of Shc from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. Insulin-stimulated tyrosine-phosphorylation of Shc exclusively in the plasma membrane was also observed using freshly isolated rat adipocytes (data not shown). In contrast, Grb2 is recruited from cytosol primarily to the IM with a lesser degree of association with the plasma membrane. The recruitment of Grb2 to the IM reaches a maximum 1 min after insulin stimulation and then decreases in a pattern similar to that of p85. In addition, whereas Ras is exclusively in the plasma membrane, mSOS is, surprisingly, exclusively in the IM and does not change after insulin stimulation. Likewise, immunoreactive Akt is exclusively in cytosol and does not change after insulin stimulation. Although, several mechanisms for activation of Akt have been proposed, including phosphorylation and binding to phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate through the PH domain of Akt (33Alessi D.R.

Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), membrane localization would be predicted to be important because attachment of the src myristoylation signal to target Akt to the membrane constitutively activates Akt (36Kohn A.D. Takeuchi F. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 21920-21926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). The failure to find Akt in membrane fractions may reflect a low affinity interaction and dissociation during fractionation or pools with different antibody reactivity. In summary, molecules involved in insulin signaling, such as IRS-1, IRS-2, p85, Grb2, and Shc, exhibit distinctive compartmentalization and undergo rapid changes in the subcellular localization in 3T3-L1 adipocytes following insulin stimulation. The compartmentalization and redistribution of these molecules may help explain how shared signaling components can elicit specific and unique downstream events for various growth factors. It may also explain how a single hormone, such as insulin, may elicit effects in one cell that differ from those produced by the same hormone in another cell type.

In addition, the structure of the PLCδ1 catalytic domain revealed a cluster of hydrophobic residues at the rim of the active site opening (hydrophobic ridge). To assess a role of each of these residues, we have expressed, purified, and characterized enzymes with the point mutations of putative active site residues (His311, Asn312, Glu341, Asp343, His356, Glu390, Lys438, Lys440, Ser522, Arg549, and Tyr551) and residues from the hydrophobic ridge (Leu320, Phe360, and Trp555). The replacements of most active site residues by alanine resulted in a great reduction (1,000–200,000-fold) of PLC activity analyzed in an inositol lipid/sodium cholate mixed micelle assay.

Among those mechanisms, the activation of mammalian PLCβ by G protein subunits and PLCγ isozymes by tyrosine kinase-linked receptors are best understood. Studies of the catalytic properties of PI-PLC revealed that, unlike regulatory mechanisms, all eukaryotic enzymes have some common characteristics (4Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic activity is strictly dependent on calcium as a cofactor and increases with a rise of calcium concentrations within the physiological range (0.01–10 μm). Phosphatidylinositol (PI), phosphatidylinositol 4-monophosphate (PIP), and PIP2 are hydrolyzed with a preference for PIP2 and PIP, but the enzymes are unable to hydrolyze 3-phosphoinositides. There is a high stereospecificity for the d-myo-inositol configuration of the headgroup but not for the configuration of the C-2 position of the diacylglycerol moiety (5Bruzik K.S. Tsai M.-D. Bioorg. Med. Chem. 1994; 2: 49-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Although glycerophosphorylinositol phosphates can be hydrolyzed by PI-PLC (6Wu Y. Perisic O. Williams R.L. Katan M. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 37: 11223-11233Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar), the presence of at least short lipid side chains is required for the efficient catalysis (7Rebecchi M.J. Eberhardt R. Delaney T. Ali S. Bittman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1735-1741Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic studies of some PLCβ, PLCγ, and PLCδ isozymes have also demonstrated that the membrane associated isozymes can catalyze several cycles of PIP2 hydrolysis functioning in a processive mode of catalysis (8James S.R. Paterson A. Harden T.K. Downes C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11872-11881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 9Wahl M.I. Jones G.A. Nishibe S. Rhee S.G. Carpenter G. J.

Critical to further understanding of PI-PLCs catalytic functions has been the determination of PLCδ1 crystal structure (15Essen L.-O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 16Ferguson K. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. Sigler P.B. Cell. 1995; 83: 1037-1048Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar). This revealed a four-domain organization of the enzyme consisting of a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, an EF-hand domain, a catalytic domain, and a C2 domain. An alignment of PI-PLC sequences has suggested that PLCβ, PLCγ, and PLCδ isozymes have all four domains found in PLCδ1 (17Williams R.L. Katan M. Structure. 1996; 4: 1387-1394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Although PLCδ1 shares sequence similarity with other PI-PLC throughout its sequence, the regions with the highest sequence similarity are contained within the catalytic domain. The residues within the conserved region X and the most conserved part of the Y region (4Rhee S.G. Choi K.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12393-12396Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) form two halves of the catalytic α/β barrel (15Essen L.-O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Based on structural studies of complexes with the PIP2 headgroup and the catalytic calcium, the importance of individual residues within the catalytic domain for the substrate binding, catalysis, and membrane interactions has been suggested (15Essen L.-O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the crystal structure of the complex with cyclic inositol phosphate (18Essen L.-O. Perisic O. Katan M. Wu Y. Roberts M.F. Williams R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1704-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and kinetic studies (6Wu Y. Perisic O. Williams R.L. Katan M. Roberts M.F. Biochemistry. 1997; 37: 11223-11233Crossref Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have suggested a reaction mechanism for PI-PLC catalysis. The data support general acid/base catalysis in a sequential mechanism with cyclic inositol phosphate as a reaction intermediate. In this study, the data obtained from structural studies of PLCδ1 complexes with the ligands have been used as a framework for a structure/function analysis. The residues that constitute putative active site and several hydrophobic residues in the vicinity of the active site opening have been subjected to site-directed mutagenesis. The impact of individual replacements on the PLC activity was analyzed under different conditions to establish further structural requirements for substrate recognition, calcium binding, catalytic steps, and surface pressure dependence. Oligonucleotides for mutagenesis and sequencing were supplied by Oswel DNA Services and also made in-house using an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer (model 394). PCR reagents and the ABI PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit for automated sequencing, using an ABI 377 sequencer, were from Perkin-Elmer. Wizard PCR preps were from Promega and mini-prep kits from Qiagen. PGEX-2T vector, glutathione-Sepharose 4B, and Mono Q column (PC1.6/5) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Human thrombin, sodium salts of soybean PI, bovine brain PIP and PIP2, as well as dioleyl phosphatidylcholine (PC) and Folch extract of bovine brain (for purification of PIP2 for the monolayer assay) were purchased from Sigma. Pig brain phosphatidylserine (PS) was from Doosan Serdary Research Laboratories. Phosphatidyl([3H])inositol ([3H]PI) and Phosphatidyl [3H]inositol 4,5-bisphosphate ([3H]PIP2) were obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (inositol-2-3H) ([3H]PIP) was obtained from American Radiolabeled Chemicals Inc. [33P]ATP (used for synthesis of [33P]PIP2 with partially purified PIP kinase from rat brain) was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The 2.2-kilobase pair BamHI/SmaI fragment from rat brain PLCδ1 cDNA (19Ellis M.V. Carne A. Katan M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar) was subcloned into PGEX-2T vector, which encodes the enzyme as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. A BamHI site had been engineered at the 5′ end of the cDNA to enable cloning into the PGEX-2T vector; an internalBamHI site had first been mutated by PCR without changing the amino acid sequence. A mutation has also been introduced by PCR at residue 60, an internal thrombin cleavage recognition site, from arginine to lysine (Arg60 → Lys) resulting in higher yields of the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and its cleavage by thrombin only at the engineered cleavage site. This mutation did not interfere with any other function of the enzyme, and this mutant will be referred to as the control PLCδ1. Mutations were introduced into PLCδ1 Arg60 → Lys by the two-stage PCR-based overlap extension method (20Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6771) Google Scholar). The control PLCδ1 Arg60 → Lys was used as the template for the first stage PCR reaction; gene fragments with overlapping complementary ends from the first round were paired to provide templates for the second round using wild type external primers. One mutant, His311 → Ala, prepared by M13-based site-directed mutagenesis has been described previously (21Ellis M.V., U., S. Katan M. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Mutants Arg549 → Ala, Ser522→ Ala, Trp555 → Ala, and Tyr551 → Ala were made using wild type primers 1 and 3; all others, excluding Asp343 → Arg and Glu390 → Lys, were made using wild type primers 1 and 2.

Mutant fragments Arg549 → Ala, Ser522→ Ala, Trp555 → Ala, and Tyr551 → Ala were digested with AccI/KpnI and subcloned individually into the AccI/KpnI sites of PLCδ1 Arg60 → Lys. All mutations were verified by sequencing, and each fragment was completely sequenced to confirm that no unwanted mutations had been created. Expression and purification of recombinant PLCδ1 protein lacking the first 57 amino acids residues has been described previously (19Ellis M.V. Carne A. Katan M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 21Ellis M.V., U., S. Katan M. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).The same procedures were used to obtain PLCδ1 Arg60 → Lys and mutant enzymes. Briefly, glutathioneS-transferase fusion protein was isolated from theEscherichia coli extract by affinity chromatography on glutathione-Sepharose. The PLCδ1 protein was separated from glutathione S-transferase and removed from the affinity matrix by thrombin cleavage. Soluble PLCδ1 was further purified from minor contaminants by chromatography on a Mono Q column (PC 1.6/5) using a SMART system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Determination of protein concentration was according to Bradford (22Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (211946) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard, and aliquots of purified protein (5–10 mg/ml) stored at −20 °C. Electrophoresis in SDS-acrylamide gels, performed according to Laemmli (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar), showed that purity of all PLCδ1 proteins was >90%. In most cases, the protein yield was about 10 mg/liter of starting bacterial culture. The assay of hydrolysis of PIP2 and PI was based on methods described previously (19Ellis M.V. Carne A. Katan M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,21Ellis M.V., U., S. Katan M. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 69-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 24Katan M.

Cell. 1988; 54: 171-177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The standard reaction mixture for PIP2hydrolysis contained 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 0.5% sodium cholate, 5 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 0.4 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 220 μmPIP2 (0.025 μCi), and CaHEDTA buffer for the final concentration of free calcium of 50 μm. Incubation was at 37 °C for 10 min. In this assay, 1 unit of PLC activity corresponds to hydrolysis of 1 μmol of PIP2/min. The same assay conditions were used to monitor hydrolysis of PIP and PI. In addition, PI hydrolysis was also analyzed in sodium deoxycholate mixed micelles (0.05% sodium deoxycholate) in the presence of 1 mmcalcium. The calcium dependence of PIP2, PIP, and PI hydrolysis was analyzed using a range of calcium buffers as described previously (24Katan M. Parker P.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 168: 413-418Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). For kinetic analysis of control and mutant enzymes, initial velocities were measured at PIP2 concentrations of 0.055, 0.110, 0.220, 0.440, and 0.660 mm, with incubation times of 0, 2.5, 5, 10, and 20 min. Apparent K m andV max values were determined by plotting results as the double reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plot. Monolayer assay of the activity of the control and mutant PLCδ1 enzymes were performed as described previously for β-isoforms of PLC (13James S.R. Paterson A. Harden K. Demel R.A. Downes C.P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 848-855Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14James S. Demel R.A. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1994; 298: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 26James S.R. Smith S. Paterson A. Harden T.K. Downes C.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 917-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The composition of the monolayers was 70% PC, 27% PS, 3% PIP2 by molarity, which were spread over a buffer comprising 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 120 mm KCl, 10 mm NaCl, 2 mmEGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 μm free Ca2+ ions. Enzyme (200 ng) was added to the subphase, via an injection port in the Teflon trough, 5 min after the monolayer was spread to allow the surface pressure to stabilize. PIP2hydrolysis was assayed for 15 min, during which time the monolayer radioactivity was assayed continuously as described previously. Induction times were determined by computer-aided integration of the trace recording of changes in radioactivity in the monolayer, and the extent of the reaction was determined by sampling the radioactivity remaining in the monolayer and in 1 ml of subphase buffer at the end of the reaction. Based on the structure of PLCδ1 complexes with inositol phosphates and/or calcium analogues (15Essen L.-O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 18Essen L.-O. Perisic O. Katan M. Wu Y. Roberts M.F. Williams R.L. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 1704-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), the following residues have been implicated in interactions with the ligands: His311, Asn312, Glu341, Asp343, His356, Glu390, Lys438, Lys440, Ser522, Arg549, and Tyr551 (Fig.1 A). These putative active site residues are present within a broad, solvent accessible depression on the C-terminal end of the catalytic α/β-barrel. Comparison of 23 sequences of PI-PLC from mammalian sources and other organisms such as slime mold, yeast, and plants demonstrated that these residues are well conserved among eukaryotic enzymes (Fig.2). Residues corresponding to His311, Asn312, Glu341, Asp343, His356, Ser522, and Arg549 in PLCδ1 are invariant in all PI-PLCs. Other active site residues in PLCδ1 (Glu390, Lys438, Lys440, and Tyr551) are replaced conservatively in only a few sequences. Thus, Glu390 is replaced by aspartic acid only in PLCδ4, Lys438 by serine in plant PI-PLCs, Lys440 by histidine in the enzyme from Dictyostelium discoideum, and Tyr551 by phenylalanine in Arabidopsis thaliana. This strict conservation of residues that could comprise the PI-PLC active site suggests that substrate recognition and mechanism of catalysis are likely to be common to all eukaryotic enzymes.Figure 2An alignment of the catalytic domain amino acid sequence from different PI-PLC isozymes. The catalytic domain sequences incorporating residues from the X and Y regions of sequence similarity have been compared; the linker region (X/Y linker) was omitted. The following sequences, described in Ref. 17Williams R.L. Katan M.

All-against-all comparisons of the sequences were performed using the Darwin suite of programs running on the Computational Biochemistry Research Group Server at Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule, Zurich (cbrg.inf.ethz.ch/welcome.html). Residues in PLCδ1 selected for mutagenesis are shown in bold. Invariant residues in all sequences are indicated by anasterisk. Secondary structure elements and residue numbers of PLCδ1 are also shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Structural studies of PLCδ1 (15Essen L.-O. Perisic O. Cheung R. Katan M. Williams R.L. Nature. 1996; 380: 595-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar) also revealed a cluster of hydrophobic residues around the active site opening (Fig.1 B). This hydrophobic ridge, located at one end of the active site opening, consists of a residue from helix α5 and residues from three loops connecting β1 with α1, β2 with α2, and β7 and α6. The hydrophobic residues include Leu320 in the loop β1/α1, Tyr358 and Phe360 in the β2/α2 loop, Trp555 in the β7/α6 loop, and Leu529 from helix α5. Comparison of PI-PLC sequences (Fig. 2) have shown that positions equivalent to PLCδ1 Leu320 are occupied by hydrophobic residues in all PI-PLCs. There is at least one hydrophobic residue in the loop β2/α2 at positions corresponding to PLCδ1 Tyr358 and Phe360; Phe360 is better conserved with a hydrophobic residue absent in only two (bovine γ1 and human γ2) sequences. Conservation of hydrophobic residues equivalent to Trp555 is limited to only a few sequences. However, in most other sequences the position corresponding to residue 557, also present in the β7/α6 loop, is occupied by hydrophobic residues and could also contribute to a hydrophobic ridge as described for PLCδ1. All PLCδ1 active site residues and Leu320, Phe360, and Trp555 within the hydrophobic ridge were individually replaced, first by alanine and, in the case of Glu341, Glu390, and Asp343, by other residues as well (Table II). All changes have been introduced into the full-length PLCδ1 using PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. The control enzyme and PLCδ1 with the point mutations were expressed as fusion proteins, subjected to thrombin cleavage, and further purified and concentrated on a Mono Q column. Expression levels of different point mutants were comparable to the control (∼10 mg/liter of bacterial culture) with the exception of Ser522 that was reduced 5–10-fold.Table IIPhospholipase C activity of control and mutant PLCδ1PLCδ1Activityunits/mgControl PLCδ1 PIP2, 50 μm calcium1080.0 PI, 50 μmcalcium21.6 PIP, 50 μm calcium360.0 PIP2, 3 mm EGTA0.059Mutations in the active site PIP2, 50 μm calcium His311 → Ala0.060 Asn312 → Ala0.032 Glu341 → Ala0.004 Glu341→ Gln0.010 Glu341 → His0.015 Asp343 → Ala0.216 Asp343 → Arg0.006 His356 → Ala0.174 Glu390→ Ala0.900 Glu390 → Gln4.50 Glu390 → His0.734 Glu390 → Lys0.011 Lys438 → Ala33.75 Lys440→ Ala216.0 Ser522 → Ala0.088 Arg549 → Ala1.27 Tyr551 → Ala1.770Mutations in the hydrophobic ridge PIP2, 50 μm calcium Leu320 → Ala284.2 Phe360 → Ala276.9 Trp555 → Ala302.1 Open table in a new tab PLC activity of the enzymes with single point mutations of the active site residues was compared with the activity of the control enzyme using a sodium cholate/PIP2 mixed micelle assay.

J. 1995; 312: 661-666Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), it was demonstrated that the deletion of the PH domain (containing the high affinity, non-catalytic PIP2-binding site) had no effect on the rate of PIP2 hydrolysis and that the remainder of the enzyme could directly bind and hydrolyze the substrate presented in this way. Data obtained from analysis of the active site residue replacements by alanine are summarized in Table II and Fig.3. Specific activity of the control enzyme at a calcium concentration of 50 μm (control conditions) was about 1,000 units/mg, consistent with our previous measurements (19Ellis M.V. Carne A. Katan M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 213: 339-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The Glu341 → Ala mutation caused the greatest reduction of specific activity to 0.004 unit/mg,i.e. over 200,000-fold. The His311 → Ala, Asn312 → Ala, and Ser522 → Ala mutations resulted in reduction of specific activity to 0.03–0.09 unit/mg (10,000–35,000-fold). A reduction of 600–6,000-fold (specific activity 0.1–2 units/mg) was observed for the mutants Asp343 → Ala, His356 → Ala, Glu390 → Ala, Arg549 → Ala, and Tyr551 → Ala. Replacements of Lys438 and Lys440 resulted in only 30-fold and 5-fold reductions, respectively. The impact of the point mutations on activity of PLCδ1 was also analyzed using PI and conditions adjusted for maximum hydrolysis of this substrate (1 mm calcium, sodium deoxycholate mixed micelles) (Fig. 3). The -fold reductions of PI hydrolysis calculated for replacements of His311, Asn312, Glu341, Asp343, His356, Glu390, and Tyr551 to Ala were comparable with the data obtained for hydrolysis of PIP2 (all differences were less than 3-fold). In contrast, the specific activities of Lys438 → Ala, Lys440 → Ala, Ser522 → Ala, and Arg549 → Ala toward PI were not reduced to the levels measured with P"
https://openalex.org/W2076370506,"Voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels are important in the physiology of both excitable and nonexcitable cells. The diversity in Kv currents is reflected in multiple Kv channel genes whose products may assemble as multisubunit heteromeric complexes. Given the fundamental importance and diversity of Kv channels, surprisingly little is known regarding the cellular mechanisms regulating their synthesis, assembly, and metabolism. To begin to dissect these processes, we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify cytoplasmic regulatory molecules that interact with Kv channel proteins. Here we report the cloning of a novel gene encoding a Kv channel binding protein (KChAP, forK+channel-associatedprotein), which modulates the expression of Kv2 channels in heterologous expression system assays. KChAP interacts with the N termini of Kvα2 subunits, as well as the N termini of Kvα1 and the C termini of Kvβ subunits. Kv2.1 and KChAP were coimmunoprecipitated from in vitro translation reactions supporting a direct interaction between the two proteins. The amplitudes of Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 currents are enhanced dramatically in Xenopus oocytes coexpressing KChAP, but channel kinetics and gating are unaffected. Although KChAP binds to Kv1.5, it has no effect on Kv1.5 currents. We suggest that KChAP may act as a novel type of chaperone protein to facilitate the cell surface expression of Kv2 channels. Voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels are important in the physiology of both excitable and nonexcitable cells. The diversity in Kv currents is reflected in multiple Kv channel genes whose products may assemble as multisubunit heteromeric complexes. Given the fundamental importance and diversity of Kv channels, surprisingly little is known regarding the cellular mechanisms regulating their synthesis, assembly, and metabolism. To begin to dissect these processes, we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify cytoplasmic regulatory molecules that interact with Kv channel proteins. Here we report the cloning of a novel gene encoding a Kv channel binding protein (KChAP, forK+channel-associatedprotein), which modulates the expression of Kv2 channels in heterologous expression system assays. KChAP interacts with the N termini of Kvα2 subunits, as well as the N termini of Kvα1 and the C termini of Kvβ subunits. Kv2.1 and KChAP were coimmunoprecipitated from in vitro translation reactions supporting a direct interaction between the two proteins. The amplitudes of Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 currents are enhanced dramatically in Xenopus oocytes coexpressing KChAP, but channel kinetics and gating are unaffected. Although KChAP binds to Kv1.5, it has no effect on Kv1.5 currents. We suggest that KChAP may act as a novel type of chaperone protein to facilitate the cell surface expression of Kv2 channels. The electrical properties of excitable cells are determined in large part by the voltage-gated K+ channels (Kv) 1The abbreviations used are: Kv channel, voltage-gated K+ channel; kb, kilobase pair(s); GBP, Gu-binding protein; IP, immunoprecipitation. they possess. Multiple Kv channels control the falling phase of the action potential in excitable cells. Kv channels are also important in many nonexcitable cells, where they may contribute to diverse processes such as volume regulation, hormone secretion, and activation by mitogens. The extensive diversity in Kv currents is matched by the multiplicity of genes encoding the pore-forming or α-subunit of Kv channels. About 20 mammalian Kvα genes have been cloned, and most have been assigned to one of four major subfamilies based on sequence similarities: Kv1, Kv2, Kv3, and Kv4 (1Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Trends Neurosci. 1990; 13: 415-419Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Each K+ channel gene encodes a single subunit, and functional channels are formed by the tetrameric association of individual subunits apparently mediated by specific binding between the N-terminal domains of subunits within individual subfamilies (2Li M. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Science. 1992; 257: 1225-1230Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 3Xu J. Yu W. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Li M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24761-24768Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). With multiple Kv channel genes whose products may assemble as multisubunit heteromeric complexes (4Ruppersberg J.P. Schroter K.H. Sakmann B. Stocker M. Sewing S. Pongs O.

Martin T.M. Schwartzkroin P.A. Tempel B.L. Nature. 1993; 365: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), there may be hundreds of functionally distinct K+ channels. Given the great diversity and fundamental importance of K+ channels, the cellular mechanisms regulating their synthesis, assembly, and metabolism are of prime interest but remain largely unknown. The identification and characterization of accessory or modulatory subunits for Kv channels is a new and rapidly expanding area of research. One family of modulatory proteins that interact with Kvα1 channels, Kvβ subunits, has been cloned and characterized in the past several years. Kvβ subunit genes, cloned from heart (7Majumder K.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 377 (389): 393Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), encode cytoplasmic proteins that form stable complexes with Kvα1 subunits and exert multiple effects on Kvα1 currents. The three Kvβ1 isoforms and Kvβ3 introduce inactivation into Kvα1 subunit currents but with variable potency (12Rettig J. Heinemann S.H. Wunder F. Lorra C. Parcej D.A. Dolly J.O. Pongs O. Nature. 1994; 369: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 13Heinemann S.J. Rettig J. Wunder F. Pongs O.

Chem. 1996; 271: 28311-28317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). A second effect of Kvβ subunits is to increase the surface expression of certain Kvα1 channels. This has been demonstrated both as an increase in the number of dendrotoxin-binding sites (for Kv1.2 transient expression) (15Shi G. Nakahira K. Hammond S. Rhodes K.J. Schechter L.S. Trimmer J.S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 843-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar), as well as an increase in the number of functional channels (16Accili E.A. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Wang Z. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25824-25831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Complexes between Kvα1 and Kvβ subunits have been found to form in the endoplasmic reticulum (15Shi G. Nakahira K. Hammond S. Rhodes K.J. Schechter L.S. Trimmer J.S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 843-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 17Nagaya N. Papazian D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3022-3027Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), suggesting that Kvβ subunits assist in the folding and assembly of at least some Kvα1 subunits. The association of Kv1.2 with Kvβ subunits produces more efficient glycosylation of Kv1.2, increases the stability of Kv1.2 through Kv1.2·Kvβ complex formation and results in an increase in cell surface expression (15Shi G. Nakahira K. Hammond S. Rhodes K.J. Schechter L.S. Trimmer J.S. Neuron. 1996; 16: 843-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). To gain more information about the synthesis, assembly, and metabolism of K+ channels, we have used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify novel cytoplasmic molecules that interact with Kv subunits. Using Kvβ1.2 as bait, we screened a rat brain cDNA library in the GAL4 activation domain vector and isolated a novel gene that encodes a K+ channel-binding protein that we have termed KChAP (forK+channel-associatedprotein). In addition to Kvβ subunits, KChAP also binds to the N termini of Kvα1 and Kvα2 subunits. Coexpression of KChAP with Kvα2 subunits results in a dramatic enhancement of both total Kv2.1 protein and surface expression of functional Kv2 channels. The unique sequence and properties of KChAP suggest that it may belong to a novel class of proteins with “chaperone-like” properties. The entire Kvβ1.2 coding sequence (amino acids 1–408) was subcloned in frame into the GAL4 DNA binding domain vector, pGBT9 (CLONTECH) after polymerase chain reaction-mediated addition of a 5′ EcoRI site and a 3′ SalI site and used to screen a pGAD10 rat brain cDNA library (CLONTECH). Transformants in the yeast Y190 strain were plated on synthetic medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and histidine but containing 3-aminotriazole (25 mm). After incubation for 8 days at 30 °C, His+ colonies were screened for β-galactosidase activity by a filter lift assay. Individual pGAD10 recombinant plasmids were screened for interaction with Kvβ1.2 by repeating the yeast two-hybrid assay. The KChAP-Y/pGAD10 plasmid contained a 1.78-kb insert with an open reading frame of 264 amino acids. To obtain the full-length clone, the 32P-labeled KChAP-Y insert was used to screen a rat brain cDNA library in λgt10 (CLONTECH). One of the hybridizing clones contained an insert of 3.2 kb with a single open reading frame of 574 amino acids. KChAP cDNA without 5′- or 3′-untranslated sequences for subcloning in frame into the yeast two-hybrid vector pGBT9 was prepared by polymerase chain reaction to include a 5′ EcoRI site and a 3′ SalI site. Protein-protein interactions were monitored with the yeast Matchmaker two-hybrid system (CLONTECH). The following fragments were tested for interaction with KChAP: Kvβ1.2 (amino acids 1–408), Kvβ1.2 N terminus (amino acids 1–79), Kvβ1C (carboxyl-terminal 329 amino acids of the Kvβ1 subfamily), Kvβ2 (amino acids 1–367), Kv1.1 N terminus (amino acids 1–168), Kv1.2 N terminus (amino acids 1–124), Kv1.4 N terminus (amino acids 1–305), Kv1.4 C terminus (amino acids 562–654), Kv1.5 N terminus (amino acids 1–248), Kv2.1 N terminus (amino acids 1–168), Kv2.2 N terminus (amino acids 1–185), Kv6.1 N terminus (amino acids 1–209), Kir2.2 N terminus (amino acids 1–86), and HERG N terminus (amino acids 1–396). Human Gu-binding protein (GBP) cDNA encoding the region from residues Met49 to Asp645 was obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction from human brain poly(A)+ RNA. Met49 corresponds to the start methionine residue in KChAP. Protein-protein interactions were tested by cotransformation of plasmid pairs into the yeast host strain Y190 as described previously (16Accili E.A. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Wang Z. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25824-25831Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The appearance of a blue color within 8 h was scored as a positive interaction. A rat multiple tissue Northern blot (CLONTECH) was probed with a32P-riboprobe spanning the region encoding the C-terminal 167 amino acids of KChAP. A T7 promoter sequence was engineered directly onto the end of the 501-base pair coding fragment using the Lig'nScribe kit from Ambion and the riboprobe synthesized with the Maxiscript T7 kit (Ambion). The blot was hybridized with probe (106 cpm/ml) overnight at 68 °C in NorthernMax hybridization buffer (Ambion). Two room temperature washes in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS (15 min each) were followed by two washes at 70 °C in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS (20 min each). Full-length KChAP cDNA was removed from pGBT9 with EcoRI andSalI and subcloned into a pCR3 vector, which we modified to allow the cloning of EcoRI/SalI fragments in frame behind a c-myc tag. cRNA for c-myc-KChAP was prepared with the T7 mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion). cRNAs for c-myc-KChAP and Kv2.1 were translated in vitroeither separately or together in rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the presence of [35S]methionine using the Retic Lysate IVT kit (Ambion). A maximum of 500 ng of cRNA was used in each 25-μl translation reaction. Canine pancreatic microsomes (Boehringer Mannheim) (1 μl/25 μl of translation reaction) were included in reactions in which Kv2.1 was translated. For immunoprecipitation (IP), 10-μl aliquots of each translation were diluted into 1 ml of IP buffer (1% Triton X-100, 150 mm NaCl, 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA). To monitor the ability of the two proteins to associate after translation, 10-μl aliquots of individual translates of Kv2.1 and c-myc-KChAP were mixed in 1 ml of IP buffer prior to the addition of antibody. IP was performed with two primary antibodies: anti-Kv2.1 polyclonal (1:100; Upstate Biotechnology, Inc) or anti-c-myc monoclonal (1:400; Boehringer Mannheim). After the addition of the primary antibody, the reactions were mixed gently overnight at 4 °C. Immune complexes were collected on magnetic beads coupled to either anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Dynal, Inc). After four washes in IP buffer, bound protein was eluted by boiling in SDS sample buffer and analyzed on 10% polyacrylamide/SDS gels. The gel was fixed, soaked in Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and radiolabeled protein detected by fluorography. Five days postinjection, two microelectrode voltage clamp recordings were made fromXenopus oocytes injected with either Kv2.1 cRNA alone or coinjected with Kv2.1 plus c-myc-KChAP cRNAs. Several hours after recording, the same oocytes were fixed and sectioned as described previously (18Chan K.W. Sui J.L. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6548-6555Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). After incubation for 2 h in 1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline to block nonspecific binding sites, the oocyte sections were incubated at 4 °C overnight with primary antibody (anti-Kv2.1 polyclonal, 1:100) in 1% bovine serum albumin/phosphate-buffered saline. The secondary antibody (fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit, 1:100; Cappel Labs) was added for 2 h at room temperature. For oocytes coinjected with c-myc-KChAP, the same protocol was followed with anti-c-myc monoclonal antibody (1:400) and tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:125; Sigma). The sections were examined with an Olympus BH-2 microscope. To isolate membranes, oocytes were homogenized in 0.3 m sucrose, 10 mm NaPO4, pH 7.4 (20 μl/oocyte) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete, Boehringer Mannheim). After removal of nuclei and debris by centrifugation at 3000 ×g for 10 min, the supernatant was spun at 48,000 ×g for 1 h to pellet membranes. Membranes from adult rat brain were prepared using the same protocol. In some experiments, oocyte nuclei were removed manually (19Feldherr C.M. Richmond P.A. Methods Cell Biol. 1978; 17: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Enucleated oocytes were processed as described above while the nuclei were extracted for 1 h in homogenization buffer plus 1% Triton X-100. Following a 20-min spin at 10,000 × g, the supernatant containing solubilized nuclear proteins was collected. Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA method (Pierce). For Western blotting, proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After blocking with 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.1% Tween 20, blots were incubated with primary antibodies, either a monoclonal Kv2.1 antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc; 1:1000) or monoclonal anti-c-myc antibody (1:400), for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were then incubated with secondary antibody (anti-mouse HRP conjugate, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; 1:3000) and developed with the ECL-Plus detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For cRNA synthesis and expression in Xenopus oocytes, full-length KChAP coding sequence was subcloned into the vector, pCR3 (Invitrogen). KChAP cRNA was prepared using the T7 mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit (Ambion) following linearization of the construct withNotI. GBP cDNA was subcloned into a modified pSP64 vector (NruI site for linearization incorporated past the poly(A)+ tail) for in vitro transcription with SP6 polymerase. cRNAs for Kv1α subunits were prepared as described previously (7Majumder K. DeBiasi M. Wang Z. Wible B.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 14Wang Z. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28311-28317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Rat Kv2.1 in pBluescript was linearized withNotI, and cRNA was prepared with T7 polymerase. cRNAs were mixed and injected into Xenopus oocytes as described previously (7Majumder K. DeBiasi M. Wang Z. Wible B.A. FEBS Lett. 1995; 361: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). HERG cDNA was kindly provided by Dr. M. Keating. Kv2.2 was a gift from Drs. S. Snyder and J. Trimmer. Kir2.2 cRNA was prepared as described previously (20Wible B.A. DeBiasi M. Majumder K. Taglialatela M. Brown A.M. Circ. Res. 1995; 76: 343-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). We also used a cRNA encoding Kv2.1ΔN in which the N-terminal 139 amino acids had been deleted (21VanDongen A.M.J. Frech G.C. Drewe J.A. Joho R.H. Brown A.M. Neuron. 1990; 5: 433-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Measurement of Xenopus oocyte whole cell currents was performed using the standard two-microelectrode voltage clamp technique. Bath solution contained (in mmol/liter): 5 KOH, 100 NaOH, 0.5 CaCl2, 2 MgCl2, 100 methanesulfonic acid, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4). Solution containing 50 K+ was prepared by replacing an equivalent concentration of Na+. Electrodes were filled with 3 m KCl and had a resistance of 0.3–0.6 megohms. All recordings were made at room temperature. Linear leakage and capacity transient currents were subtracted (P/4 prepulse protocol) unless specified, and data were low pass-filtered at 1 kHz. pClamp software (Axon Instruments) was used for generation of the voltage-pulse protocols and data acquisition. Data are reported as means ± S.E. Comparisons among multiple groups of oocytes were performed by one-way analysis of variance test, Student's ttest, and Student-Newman-Keuls post hoc test. Means are considered to be significantly different when p < 0.05. Full-length Kvβ1.2 was used as bait to screen a rat brain cDNA library in the GAL4 activation domain vector, pGAD10. We isolated one clone that exhibited a strong positive signal in the β-galactosidase assay. pGAD10 plasmid DNA containing a 1.78-kb insert was isolated from this clone and tested positive for interaction with Kvβ1.2. Sequence analysis of the clone, which we termed KChAP-Y (for Kchannel-associated protein; Y refers to the fragment isolated in the yeast two-hybrid screen), revealed a novel clone with no similarity to Kvα or Kvβ subunits. We tested the specificity of interaction of KChAP-Y with a panel of Kvβ, Kvα, and other K+ channel subunit fragments with the yeast two-hybrid assay. As shown in Fig.1, KChAP-Y interacted with both Kvβ1.2 and Kvβ2 subunits. KChAP-Y interacted with the conserved Kvβ1 C terminus but not the unique N terminus of Kvβ1.2, suggesting that the protein may recognize conserved sequences among Kvβ subunits. Kvβ subunits interact specifically with the N terminus of Kv1α subunits, so we tested these fragments for binding to KChAP-Y as well. Surprisingly, a positive signal was observed between the N termini of Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.4, Kv1.5, and KChAP-Y. Just as with the Kvβ subunits, however, no interaction was evident between the Kv1.4 C terminus and KChAP-Y. KChAP-Y also interacted with the N termini of Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 but not with the N terminus of the electrically silent Kv2 partner, Kv6.1 (22Post M. Kirsch G.E. Brown A.M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 399: 177-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Further specificity for a subset of Kv channels was apparent from the lack of interaction with the N terminus of the inward rectifier K+ channel, Kir2.2, and the N terminus of the delayed rectifier K+ channel, HERG. Thus, KChAP-Y apparently interacts with both the C terminus of Kvβ subunits and the N termini of Kv1 and Kv2 α-subunits. Screening of a rat brain cDNA library with the KChAP-Y coding sequence produced a 3.2-kb insert, which overlapped KChAP-Y and contained a single open reading frame of 574 amino acids. The initiating methionine was assigned as the first ATG downstream from three in frame stop codons. Hydropathy analysis indicated no potential membrane spanning domains in KChAP, suggesting that the protein was cytoplasmic (not shown). Search of the GenBankTM nonredundant data base revealed significant homology with the mammalian gene encoding GBP (23Valdez B.C. Henning D. Perlaky L. Busch R.K. Busch H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). GBP was isolated originally in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a protein that binds to the Gu/RNA helicase II subunit. Alignment of KChAP with GBP is presented in Fig. 2. GBP has an N-terminal extension of 55–57 amino acids compared with KChAP, but over the 574-amino acid open reading frame of KChAP, the two proteins are 50% identical. We tested the binding of both full-length KChAP (amino acids 1–574) and human GBP (amino acids 49–645) with K+ channel fragments in the yeast two-hybrid assay as was described for KChAP-Y in Fig. 1. Full-length KChAP was identical to KChAP-Y in its interaction with protein partners in the yeast two-hybrid assay, while GBP did not interact with any of the tested fragments including Kvβ and Kvα subunits (data not shown). Thus, although KChAP shares significant homology with GBP, interaction with Kvβ and Kvα subunits appears to be a unique feature of KChAP. The expression of KChAP mRNA was examined in a panel of rat tissues. The blot was probed with a fragment of KChAP encoding amino acids Lys407–Asp574, a region with minimal homology to GBP, to avoid detecting GBP transcripts as well. As shown in Fig. 3, a single band of ∼3.2 kb was detected in a variety of tissues including heart and brain with especially high levels in lung and kidney. The surprising finding that KChAP associated with Kvα1 and Kvα2 subunits as well as Kvβ subunits led us to examine the functional consequences of KChAP-K+ channel interaction upon heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes. Whole oocyte currents were recorded by two-electrode voltage clamp from eggs injected with cRNAs encoding different Kvα-subunits alone or with saturating concentrations of KChAP. Coexpression with KChAP produced a dramatic 3-fold increase in the amplitude of Kv2.1 currents (Fig.4 A). No change in Kv2.1 currents was apparent when the channel was coexpressed with GBP (data not shown). At more depolarized potentials, Kv2.1 has an opening probability of about 0.9 (24Shieh C.C. Klemic K.G. Kirsch G.E. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 109: 767-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), suggesting that the increased currents recorded when KChAP was coexpressed were probably due to an increase in the number of functional channels. KChAP also interacted with the N terminus of Kv1.5 but, in contrast to Kv2.1, produced no significant change in Kv1.5 currents when coexpressed in oocytes (Fig.4 B). The experiments were done so that Kv1.5 expressed whole cell currents at +70 mV in the range of 0.5–5 μA. This greatly reduced the possibility that amplitude changes might be missed as a result of voltage clamp difficulties. Thus, while KChAP interacted with the N termini of both Kv2.1 and Kv1.5 in the yeast two-hybrid assay, KChAP only produced amplitude increases in Kv2.1 currents in oocyte expression assays. Fig. 4 C summarizes the effects of KChAP on the current amplitudes of a variety of K+ channels. In 13 batches of oocytes coinjected with both Kv2.1 and KChAP, we observed an average increase in whole oocyte currents of about 2.5-fold compared with oocytes expressing Kv2.1 alone. KChAP also produced comparable increases in Kv2.2 currents. We also examined the functional expression of a deleted Kv2.1 in which the N-terminal 139 residues were removed (21VanDongen A.M.J. Frech G.C. Drewe J.A. Joho R.H. Brown A.M. Neuron. 1990; 5: 433-443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4 C, coexpression with KChAP did not significantly alter current amplitudes in oocytes expressing Kv2.1ΔN. This suggests that binding between the Kv2.1 N terminus and KChAP is critical for current enhancement. Two K+ channels that did not exhibit N-terminal binding to KChAP, Kir2.2 and HERG, were also tested. For each channel, experiments were done with whole cell control inward currents not exceeding 10 μA at −100 mV. As shown in Fig. 4 C, neither channel exhibited altered current amplitudes in the presence of KChAP. The expression enhancement of Kv2.1 currents in the presence of KChAP could be due to an increase in the number of functional channels at the cell surface or an alteration in the kinetics or gating of individual channels. To distinguish between these mechanisms, we used both immunocytochemical and electrophysiological methods. We examined the surface expression of Kv2.1 protein in oocytes expressing either Kv2.1 alone or Kv2.1 plus c-myc-KChAP by immunocytochemistry. Fig.5 shows the whole cell currents recorded from a single oocyte injected with Kv2.1 alone (panel A) or Kv2.1 plus c-myc-KChAP (panel B). Currents were increased about 3-fold in the c-myc-KChAP-coinjected egg. The same two oocytes were fixed, sectioned, and co-stained with Kv2.1 and c-myc antibodies. Kv2.1 at the cell surface was visualized by indirect immunofluorescence with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody. Fluorescence at the oocyte surface was much brighter in the egg expressing both Kv2.1 and KChAP (panel D) compared with the one expressing Kv2.1 alone (panel C), suggesting that the amount of Kv2.1 protein at the cell surface was increased when the channel was coexpressed with KChAP. No staining with the c-myc antibody was seen, suggesting that KChAP is not present at the cell surface with Kv2.1 (panel E). To determine whether KChAP increased the total expression of Kv2.1 protein or only altered the subcellular distribution of the channel, we examined membrane fractions from oocytes injected with Kv2.1 alone or Kv2.1 plus KChAP by Western blotting. As shown in Fig.6 A, the amount of Kv2.1 protein in oocyte membranes was increased in oocytes coinjected with KChAP (compare lanes 1 and 2). Densitometry of the blots indicated about a 2.5-fold increase in Kv2.1 protein in the presence of KChAP. Similar results were obtained when Kv2.1 was immunoprecipitated from homogenates of total oocyte protein (data not shown). This value is comparable with the increase observed in Kv2.1 currents with KChAP. Since no KChAP was detected at the cell surface of co-expressing oocytes, we examined the cellular distribution of KChAP in oocytes by Western blotting. We manually removed the nuclei from pools of oocytes expressing only Kv2.1 or Kv2.1 plus c-myc-KChAP and probed the nuclear fraction as well as the soluble and membrane fractions prepared from the enucleated oocytes with an anti-c-mycantibody to detect tagged KChAP. Most of the KChAP protein was present in the nuclear fraction with smaller amounts detectable in the soluble as well as the membrane fractions (Fig. 6 B). The signal was so strong in the nuclear material compared with the other two fractions, however, that we were not able to estimate accurately the relative amounts in each fraction. No Kv2.1 was detected in the nuclear fraction, indicating that contamination with nonnuclear membranes was minimal (data not shown). The kinetics and gating of Kv2.1 channels were not altered in the presence of KChAP. As shown in Fig.7 A, the voltage-dependence of activation and the kinetics of activation and deactivation of Kv2.1 channels were not changed. Coexpression with KChAP did not alter the sensitivity of Kv2.1 channels to TEA either (data not shown). Thus, KChAP increased the number of functional channels at the cell surface without altering individual Kv2.1 channel kinetics. The effect of KChAP on Kv2.1 currents was saturable as shown in Fig. 7 B. Coexpression of a constant amount of Kv2.1 cRNA with increasing amounts of KChAP cRNA resulted in increased steady state Kv2.1 currents until saturation was reached. The influence of KChAP on the time course of Kv2.1 expression in oocytes over a period of 9 days postinjection is shown in Fig. 7 C. In all of the electrophysiological experiments presented thus far, KChAP and Kv2.1 cRNAs were mixed prior to injection into oocytes in the same pipette. Importantly, when we injected the two cRNAs separately into the same oocyte with different pipettes, no enhancement of Kv2.1 currents was observed (data not shown). This result suggests that KChAP exerts its effect on Kv2.1 in oocytes by a direct physical association with the channel, which is facilitated by the coinjection of both cRNAs into the same space inside the oocyte. The electrophysiological data suggest that a direct interaction between Kv2.1 and KChAP occurs and is responsible for the enhancement in Kv2.1 currents observed in oocytes. We used an in vitro binding assay to demonstrate the ability of the two proteins to associate. Kv2.1 and KChAP cRNAs were translated in vitro either separately or together in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine. We used a commercially available anti-Kv2.1 polyclonal antiserum to immunoprecipitate Kv2.1 and analyzed the immunoprecipitated material with SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and fluorography to detect the presence of associated KChAP. Since an antibody to KChAP was not available, we used an epitope tag fused to the N terminus of KChAP (c-myc) to allow detection. As we had previously shown in Fig. 5, the c-myctag did not interfere with the functional interaction of KChAP and Kv2.1. Control reactions with Kv2.1 translated alone showed thatin vitro translated Kv2.1 was immunoprecipitated with anti-Kv2.1 antibody but not anti-c-myc antisera (Fig.8, lanes 1 and 2). Similarly, anti-c-myc antisera immunoprecipitated c-myc-KChAP but not Kv2.1 (Fig. 8, lanes 3 and4). Kv2.1 antibody coimmunoprecipitated complexes of Kv2.1 and KChAP when the two cRNAs were cotranslated (Fig. 8, lane 5) but not when the two cRNAs were translated in separate reactions and mixed together prior to the addition of primary antibody (Fig. 8, lane 6). This result suggests that the association of KChAP with Kv2.1 occurs cotranslationally, since the mature proteins added after translation did not coimmunoprecipitate. All reactions involving translation of Kv2.1 cRNA shown here included canine pancreatic microsomes to allow the channel to insert into membrane as it was synthesized. When microsomes were omitted from cotranslation reactions, no coimmunoprecipitation of the two proteins was observed (data not shown). We have cloned a novel gene, kchap, which encodes a K+ channel regulatory protein. All of our data point to a direct interaction between KChAP and Kv2.1 as responsible for the current enhancement observed in Xenopus oocytes. Yeast two-hybrid assays showed an interaction between KChAP and the N terminus of Kv2.1. When an N-terminally truncated Kv2.1 was expressed in oocytes, no expression enhancement was observed. Also, Kv2.1 and KChAP were co-immunoprecipitated from in vitro translations in which the two proteins were translated in the same reaction, but not when they were translated separately and mixed together before immunoprecipitation. This suggests a cotranslational association of the two proteins, which is also supported by oocyte data. In order to observe Kv2.1 current enhancement in oocytes, the KChAP and Kv2.1 cRNAs had to be mixed together and coinjected with the same pipette. No changes in Kv2.1 currents were noted when the two cRNAs were injected from two separate pipettes, suggesting that the two proteins must be translated in close proximity. However, in the oocyte, KChAP might bind only transiently to Kv2 channels and not remain stably attached to the mature channel as evidenced by the lack of KChAP staining at the oocyte surface. In Xenopus oocytes, KChAP does not appear to alter the time course of Kv2.1 current expression. Without KChAP, the amplitude of whole oocyte Kv2.1 currents continues to increase slowly from the time of injection through about 6 days, at which time the current levels plateau and remain fairly constant through 9 days postinjection. This would suggest that transit of Kv2.1 channels to the oocyte surface is a rather slow process. KChAP does not change this profile but increases the amplitude of Kv2.1 currents recorded at each time point. One possible explanation for the effect of KChAP on Kv2.1 expression is that KChAP may act as a chaperone to facilitate either the translation, assembly, or stability of Kv2.1 channels. An increase in the amount of Kv2.1 protein in oocyte membranes in the presence of KChAP as seen by Western blotting is consistent with this interpretation. Kvβ subunits also exhibit chaperone-like effects on Kv channels. However, Kvβ subunits (Kvβ1 and Kvβ2) form stable complexes with Kvα subunits, and although they are cytoplasmic proteins, travel to the cell surface with pore-forming Kvα subunits and remain tightly attached there as part of mature channel complexes (28Parcej D.N.

KChAP defines a different structural gene from Kvβ subunits, however, and there are significant differences between Kvβ and KChAP action as well. Unlike Kvβ subunits 1–3, KChAP modulates both Kv2.2 and Kv2.1 currents but has no effect on Kv1.5 currents. The significance of KChAP binding to Kvβ or Kvα1 subunits is currently unknown. KChAP binds to the conserved C terminus of Kvβ subunits. This is the same domain to which the N termini of Kvα1 subunits have been shown to bind (14Wang Z. Kiehn J. Yang Q. Brown A.M. Wible B.A. J.

Neuron. 1996; 16: 455-463Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). One could envision that KChAP might modulate the association of Kvα1 and Kvβ subunits and, thus, indirectly affect the expression and/or kinetic properties of Kv1 currents, but this is speculative at present. Although KChAP and Kvβ subunits share no sequence homology, KChAP is 50% identical to the human GBP (23Valdez B.C. Henning D. Perlaky L. Busch R.K. Busch H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). GBP is a novel protein that was cloned by interaction with the Gu/RH-II helicase in the yeast two-hybrid system. GBP did not interact with either Kvα or Kvβ subunits in yeast two-hybrid assays and did not modulate Kv2.1 currents in coexpression assays in oocytes. GBP is a nuclear protein that has been shown to produce proteolytic cleavage of Gu/RH-II (23Valdez B.C. Henning D. Perlaky L. Busch R.K. Busch H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 234: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The significance of the sequence similarity between the two proteins is unclear at present. Interestingly, however, KChAP protein was primarily detected in the nuclei of injected oocytes. The relationship of the nuclear localization of KChAP with its effects on Kv2 channels is presently unclear. If a direct interaction between KChAP and Kv2.1 is required for expression enhancement, then this may occur transiently prior to KChAP moving to the nucleus. We cannot rule out, however, that KChAP may play an as yet unknown role in the nucleus, which results in enhanced Kv2.1 protein and current levels. To summarize, we have described a novel gene product, KChAP, which binds to Kvα and Kvβ subunits. KChAP increases currents expressed by Kv2.1 and Kv2.2 but not Kv1.5, and the expression enhancement is due to an increase in total protein as well as in the number of functional Kv2 channels at the cell surface. We speculate that KChAP may act as a novel type of chaperone protein for Kv2 channels. We thank Dr. M. Post for Kv2.1, Kv2.2, and Kv6.1 fragments in pGBT9; Dr. E. Ficker for sectioning oocytes; Drs.

In this study, we explored the regulatory mechanisms underlying this differentiation-associated MMP-9 gene expression in human HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells and human peripheral blood monocytes.

Under physiological and pathological conditions, macrophages participate in modulating the extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover.

Its proteolytic activity is thought to be necessary for a variety of monocyte/macrophage functions, such as extravasation, migration, and tissue remodeling during chronic inflammatory conditions (5Welgus H.G.

Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 991-999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A number of previous studies have shown that the MMP-9 production by macrophages is closely associated with cellular differentiation (5Welgus H.G. Campbell E.J. Cury J.D. Eisen A.Z. Senior R.M. Wilhelm S.M. Goldberg G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar, 6Campbell E.J. Cury J.D. Shapiro S.D. Goldberg G.I. Welgus H.G. J.

While low levels of MMP-9 proenzyme are secreted from human peripheral blood monocytes, its production is markedly up-regulated in alveolar macrophages as well as in macrophages derived from in vitro differentiation. To date, the underlying regulatory mechanisms for differentiation-dependent MMP-9gene expression remain poorly defined. Cell adhesion and spreading on ECM are hallmarks of macrophage differentiation (15Collins S.J. Blood. 1989; 70: 1233-1244Crossref Google Scholar). Among the ECM components, FN has been recognized as the key element in promoting cell adhesion and various functions of monocytes and macrophages. Both cell types adhere preferentially to FN-coated surfaces in comparison to laminin and other ECM components (16Eierman D.F. Johnson C.E. Haskill J.S. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1970-1976PubMed Google Scholar, 17Shima M. Teitelbaum S.L. Holers V.M. Ruzicka C. Osmack P. Ross F.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1873-1880Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Adherence to FN promotes migration and phagocytosis of these cells and modulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor-α, and macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) (16Eierman D.F. Johnson C.E. Haskill J.S. J. Immunol. 1989; 142: 1970-1976PubMed Google Scholar, 20Thorens B. Mermod J.-J. Vassalli P. Cell. 1987; 48: 671-679Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). These functions of FN are mediated by two surface receptors, α5β1 and α4β1 integrins, both of which are present on monocytes and macrophages (21Hemler M.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 365-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The α5β1integrin recognizes the cell-binding domain of the FN molecule that contains the arginyl-glycyl-aspartyl-serine (RGDS) sequence, whereas the α4β1 integrin acts as the receptor for the CS-1 region of FN (22Hynes O.R. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8941) Google Scholar, 23Guan J.L. Hynes R.O. Cell. 1990; 60: 53-61Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar). In human peripheral blood monocytes, macrophage differentiation may be promoted by M-CSF or by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (24Wallis W.J. Beatty P.G. Ochs H.D. Harlan J.M. J. Immunol. 1985; 135: 2323-2330PubMed Google Scholar, 25Becker S. Warren M.K. Haskill S. J. Immunol. 1987; 139: 3703-3709PubMed Google Scholar, 26Brugger W. Kreutz M. Andreesen R. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1991; 49: 483-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Similarly, treatment with PMA and related reagents can induce a macrophage phenotype in the human HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells (27Huberman E. Callaham M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1293-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 28Rovera G. Santoli D. Damsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In both cell types, activation of protein kinase C (PKC) is essential for the differentiation process (30Homma Y. Henning-Chubb C.B. Huberman E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7316-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 31Imamura K. Dianoux A. Nakamura T. Kufe D. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 2423-2429Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 32Aihara H.

In HL-60 cells, several studies have established a correlation between macrophage differentiation and gene expression of PKC-β, the most abundant PKC isozyme in these cells (33Nishikawa M. Komada F. Uemura Y. Hidaka H. Shirakawa S. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 621-626PubMed Google Scholar, 34Tonetti D.A. Horio M. Collart F.R. Huberman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 739-745PubMed Google Scholar). We have described previously a PMA-resistant HL-60 cell variant, HL-525, which harbors a defect in PKC-β gene expression (32Aihara H. Asaoka Y. Yoshida K. Nishizuka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11062-11066Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid, which enhances the PKC-β expression, reverses the PMA resistance of HL-525 cells (35Yang K.D. Mizobuchi T. Kharbanda S.M. Datta R. Huberman E. Kufe D. Stone R.M. Blood. 1994; 83: 490-496Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The HL-60 cell variant described by Macfarlane and Manzel (36Macfarlane D.E. Manzel L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4327-4331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is also deficient in PKC-β expression and may be rendered PMA-susceptible by treatment with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, which similarly increases the expression of PKC-β. Recently, we have shown that restoration of the PKC-β expression in HL-525 cells by PKC-β gene transfection restored the PMA responsiveness, suggesting the essential role of PKC-β in PMA-induced HL-60 cell differentiation (37Tonetti D.A. Henning-Chubb C. Yamanishi D.T. Huberman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23230-23235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined critical steps involved in the induction of MMP-9 gene expression during macrophage differentiation in HL-60 cells treated with PMA and in human peripheral blood monocytes treated with either PMA or M-CSF. By using these two cell systems, we demonstrate that FN-mediated cell adhesion and spreading are required for induction of MMP-9 gene expression during macrophage differentiation. This process is mainly mediated through the α5β1 integrin signaling, with little contribution of the α4β1 integrin. Furthermore, in HL-525 cells, which constitutively express high levels of surface α5β1 integrin, we found that their adherence and spreading on FN were sufficient to induceMMP-9 gene expression and that PKC-β is essential for the production of this proteinase during PMA-induced macrophage differentiation. Human plasma fibronectin (FN), gelatin, all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), cytochalasins B and D, preimmune IgG controls, and a murine monoclonal antibody (mAb) to human FN (FN-15, IgG1), which was dialyzed before use, were purchased from Sigma. Mouse mAbs to human β1 (K20, mouse IgG2a), α4 (HP2/1, IgG1), and α5 (SAM1, IgG2b) integrins were purchased from Immunotech (Westbrook, ME). mAb to human 92-kDa gelatinase (MMP-9) was purchased from Oncogene Science, Inc. (Cambridge, MA). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was purchased from Chemicals for Cancer Research (Eden Prairie, MN) and macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) was from Biosource International (Camarillo, CA). H-7 and HA-1004 were from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). The human HL-60 myeloid leukemia cell line was originally obtained from R. C. Gallo (National Cancer Institute). The differentiation-resistant HL-525 cell line was established by cloning HL-60 cells subcultured for 102 times in the presence of increasing concentrations (up to 3 μm) of PMA at 5–8-day intervals (30Homma Y. Henning-Chubb C.B. Huberman E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7316-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). These cells exhibited stable PMA-resistant phenotypes for at least 50–60 subcultures (200–300 generations). Human peripheral blood monocytes were isolated from heparinized whole venous blood by Ficoll-Paque density gradient (1.077 g/ml) centrifugation as described previously (38Laouar A. Wietzerbin J. Bauvois B. Int. Immunol. 1993; 5: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The cells were cultured and maintained in Petri dishes in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Intergen Co., Purchase, NY), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and l-glutamine (2 mm) (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a humidified atmosphere containing 8% CO2 at 37 °C. All treatments were carried out in tissue culture dishes or cluster plates in serum-supplemented RPMI 1640 medium. For HL-525 cells in some experiments, the cells were inoculated and treated in FN-coated wells. The wells were coated for 16 h at room temperature with 20 μg/ml of either FN or bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. The nonspecific sites of FN-coated surfaces were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline for 30 min at 37 °C. The wells were then rinsed with 3 μm MnCl2 immediately before use. The cells were treated in serum-supplemented RPMI 1640 medium as indicated in the figure legends. After treatment, the cells were replaced with fresh serum-free medium containing the appropriate inhibitory reagent and incubated for 24–48 h prior to collection of conditioned media for analysis. Immunoblotting analysis was conducted as described previously (39Xie B. Bueana C.D. Fidler I.J. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 144: 1058-1067PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse mAb to human MMP-9 at 2 μg/ml was used as a primary antibody, and goat anti-mouse IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Bio-Rad) was used as a secondary antibody for color detection. Gelatin zymography was performed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels impregnated with 1 mg/ml gelatin, as described previously (40Morodomi T. Ogata Y. Sasaguri Y. Morimatsu M. Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Gelatinolytic activity was visualized as clear zones with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining. The amount of secreted MMP-9 proenzyme in treated cells relative to that of untreated cells was determined by using an HP ScanJet 4c Scanner (Hewlett-Packard). All transfections were performed by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser apparatus with capacitance extender in 0.4-cm gap electroporation cuvettes (Eppendorf Scientific, Madision, MI). The pMV7-RP58 plasmid (41Housey G.M. Johnson M.D. Hsio W.L.W. O'Brian C.A. Murphy J.P. Kirschmeier P. Weinstein I.B.

Weinstein, Columbia University, NY) contains both the full-length rat PKC-β1 cDNA and the bacterial neomycin phosphotransferase (neo) gene that confers resistance to the antibiotic G418 (Geneticin, Sigma). The pMV7 plasmid contains the neomycin gene only. For each transfection, 5 × 106cells were mixed with 10 μg of supercoiled plasmid DNA and 0.2 ml of phosphate-buffered sucrose (272 mm sucrose, 7 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) in a total volume of 0.5 ml. The cells were electroporated at 250 V and allowed to recover in 10 ml of serum-supplemented RPMI medium for 24 h prior to selection in medium containing 0.5 mg/ml G418. The G418-resistant transfectants were obtained by limited dilution in 24-well plates and tested for PKC-β expression and PMA inducibility of cell adhesion and spreading as well as 92-kDa gelatinase production. The selected clones were maintained in G418-containing medium. Total RNA was purified by centrifugation through a cesium chloride cushion as described by Chirgwin et al. (42Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald A.E. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16610) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (43Glesne D.A. Collart F.R. Huberman E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5417-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, total RNA was electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose gels containing 2.2 m formaldehyde, transferred onto Magna Charge Nylon membranes (Micron Separations, Inc., Westborough, MA), and fixed to the membrane by UV irradiation. Human cDNA probes for MMP-9 (kindly provided by Dr. W. Stetler-Stevenson, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) were labeled using a random primer kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) with [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were hybridized with the denatured probe at 60 °C for 18–24 h in hybridization buffer (0.5m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin, 7% SDS) and washed at 60 °C for 30 min once in 1× SSPE (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% SDS) and once in 0.1× SSPE, 0.1% SDS. The blots were autoradiographed in the dark at −80 °C. Treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) for 1–2 days induces HL-60 cells to differentiate toward the macrophage lineage (27Huberman E. Callaham M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1293-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 28Rovera G. Santoli D. Damsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

To understand how MMP-9 gene expression is regulated during this process, we treated HL-60 cells with 3 nm PMA for 24 h. Secretion of the MMP-9 proenzyme into the culture medium was detected in PMA-treated cells but not in untreated cells (Fig.1 A). Time course studies revealed that induction of MMP-9 gene expression was a relatively late event, with high levels of MMP-9 steady state mRNA detected at 8 h and the peak not occurring until 24 h after the addition of PMA (Fig. 1 B). We noted that the time course of PMA-induced MMP-9 gene expression paralleled that of cell adhesion and spreading, a hallmark of macrophage differentiation (15Collins S.J. Blood. 1989; 70: 1233-1244Crossref Google Scholar). To confirm our observation in normal blood cells, we isolated human peripheral blood monocytes and induced them to mature into macrophages by treatment with either 3 nm PMA or 250 units/ml M-CSF. Untreated monocytes produced small amounts of MMP-9 proenzyme (Fig.2 A). This result may be attributed to the fact that a fraction of monocytes spontaneously adhered to the tissue culture plates and differentiated into macrophages by the time conditioned media were collected for zymogram analysis (48 h after plating). Treatment with PMA or M-CSF promoted macrophage differentiation and, accordingly, enhanced MMP-9 secretion by 7- or 5-fold, respectively (Fig. 2 A).Figure 2Production of MMP-9 proenzyme in human peripheral blood monocytes and HL-60 cells treated with PMA or M-CSF in the presence or absence of H-7 or HA-1004. Freshly isolated human peripheral blood monocytes at 1 × 105 (A) or HL-60 cells at 7 × 104 (B) were seeded in each well of a 48-well plate in serum-supplemented RPMI 1640 medium. The cells were pretreated for 1 h with H-7 (20 μm) or HA-1004 (40 μm) before the addition of 3 nm PMA or 250 units/ml M-CSF (monocytes only). At 24 h, the cells were replaced with serum-free medium containing either H-7 or HA-1004 and incubated for an additional 24 h. The conditioned media were then harvested and directly analyzed by gelatin zymography as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The gelatinolytic activity of MMP-9 proenzyme is visualized as a clear band against a dark background. The experiment shown is representative of at least four separate experiments performed with blood monocytes isolated from four healthy individuals.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because activation of PKC is central to PMA- or M-CSF-induced macrophage differentiation (30Homma Y.

A. 1991; 88: 11062-11066Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), we were interested in defining the role of PKC in stimulation ofMMP-9 gene expression during such a differentiation. We added either H-7 (20 μm) or HA-1004 (40 μm) to blood monocytes and HL-60 cells 1 h before and during PMA or M-CSF treatment (Fig. 2); we used M-CSF only in monocytes because HL-60 cells do not express the M-CSF receptor (c-fmsproto-oncogene) (44Sariban E. Mitchell T. Kufe D. Nature. 1985; 316: 64-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). At 20 μm, H-7 inhibits PKC as well as cAMP- or cGMP-dependent kinase, whereas HA-1004 at 40 μm only affects the latter two (45Hidaka H. Inagaki M. Kawamoto S. Sasaki Y. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 5036-5041Crossref PubMed Scopus (2318) Google Scholar). The doses we used for both inhibitors did not affect cell viability, as determined by trypan blue exclusion assay. While HA-1004 affected neither cell adhesion and spreading nor MMP-9 production, H-7 was a potent inhibitor of both cell adhesion and MMP-9 production in blood monocytes treated with either PMA or M-CSF (Fig. 2 A) and in HL-60 cells treated with PMA (Fig. 2 B). The inhibitory effect of H-7 on PMA-induced MMP-9 production in HL-60 cells was confirmed by Northern blot analysis (data not shown). These results suggest the involvement of PKC in induction of MMP-9 gene expression during macrophage differentiation. Interestingly, H-7 was equally effective in inhibiting the basal level secretion of MMP-9 proenzyme from untreated monocytes (Fig. 2 A). It is noteworthy that in both monocytes and HL-60 cells, inhibition of the MMP-9 production invariably paralleled the inhibition of cell adhesion and spreading. To define further the role of PKC in MMP-9 gene expression during macrophage differentiation, we examined expression of this enzyme in HL-525 cells, HL-60-derived variant cells that are deficient in PKC-β expression and are resistant to PMA-induced macrophage differentiation (30Homma Y. Henning-Chubb C.B. Huberman E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 7316-7319Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 34Tonetti D.A. Horio M. Collart F.R. Huberman E.

Chem. 1994; 269: 23230-23235Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When treated with 30 nm PMA, these cells failed to produce the MMP-9 proenzyme, in contrast to the marked induction of this enzyme with 3 nm PMA in HL-60 cells (Fig. 3 A). Treatment with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) alone or in combination with PMA resulted in a more than 4-fold increase in PKC-β gene expression (Fig. 3 B). Combined treatment with PMA and ATRA induced MMP-9 gene expression and secretion of the proenzyme into the culture medium, whereas treatment with ATRA alone failed to do so (Fig. 3, A and B), suggesting that restoration of PKC-β gene expression alone is not sufficient to induceMMP-9 gene expression; activation of PKC activity by PMA is also required. As a comparison, addition of ATRA to HL-60 cells had no apparent influence on PMA-induced MMP-9 production (Fig.3 A). The MMP-9 induction in HL-525 cells was concurrent with the appearance of cell attachment and spreading. To assess directly the involvement of PKC-β in MMP-9 gene expression, HL-525 cells were transfected with an expression plasmid containing the full-length PKC-β cDNA and the neomycin gene that confers resistance to Geneticin (G418). As a control, the cells were also transfected with a plasmid containing the neomycin gene only. Stable transfectants were selected by limited dilution and maintained in G418-containing medium. The PKC-β gene expression in two PKC-β transfectants, HL-525/β3–2 and HL-525/β3–30, were restored to the level comparable to that in HL-60 cells (Fig.4 A). Treatment of these clones with 30 nm PMA induced cell adhesion and spreading (data not shown), which was accompanied by MMP-9 gene expression and secretion of the MMP-9 proenzyme into the culture medium (Fig. 4,B and C). Trace amounts of the MMP-9 proenzyme were detected in untreated PKC-β transfectants; addition of PMA resulted in a more than 10-fold increase in secretion of MMP-9 proenzyme in both PKC-β clones (Fig. 4 C). In contrast, no MMP-9 steady state mRNA or proenzyme was detected in the parental HL-525 or the neomycin transfectant (HL-525/neo), regardless of PMA treatment. Therefore, we conclude that activated PKC-β plays a critical role in PMA-induced MMP-9 gene expression during HL-60 cell differentiation. The 8-h lag phase in PMA-induced MMP-9 gene expression in HL-60 cells indicates that the induction is probably not directly mediated by activation of PKC but rather by cellular events downstream of PKC activation. We noted throughout our study that the induction ofMMP-9 gene expression in both blood monocytes and HL-60 cells closely paralleled the timing and extent of cell adherence and spreading, an event which involves fibronectin (FN) and its surface integrin receptors. 2A. Laouar, C. B. H. Chubb, F. R. Collart, and E. Huberman, manuscript in preparation. To determine whether FN-mediated cell adhesion and spreading have a causal role in MMP-9 gene expression, HL-60 cells were treated with PMA and peripheral blood monocytes with either PMA or M-CSF in the presence of neutralizing mAbs to FN and its integrin receptors. The anti-FN mAb, but not the preimmune IgG, blocked MMP-9 gene expression (Fig. 5 A), as well as cell adhesion and spreading (data not shown). Accordingly, secretion of the MMP-9 proenzyme into culture media was diminished (Fig.5 B). Antibodies that neutralize the function of the RGDS-dependent FN receptor α5β1integrin demonstrated similar inhibitory efficacy (Fig. 5 B). On the contrary, neutralizing anti-α4 mAb had little effect, suggesting that RGDS-dependent cell adhesion and spreading are involved in this process. The antibody-mediated inhibition of MMP-9 gene expression observed in HL-60 cells was reproduced in blood monocytes in which both basal (untreated) and stimulated (with PMA or M-CSF) secretion of MMP-9 proenzyme were strongly inhibited by anti-FN, anti-α5, and anti-β1 integrin mAbs but not by the preimmune IgG (Fig.6). Again, anti-α4 mAb was ineffective (data not shown). Doses of mAbs used in both"

We have identified and analyzed a new yeast syntaxin homolog, Tlg2p. Tlg2p is unique among known syntaxin family proteins in possessing a sizeable hydrophilic domain of 63 amino acids that is C-terminal to the membrane spanning region and nonessential for Tlg2p function. Tlg2p resides on the endosome and late Golgi by co-localization with an endocytic intermediate and co-fractionation with markers for both endosomes and late Golgi. Cells depleted for Tlg2p missort a portion of carboxypeptidase Y and are defective in endocytosis. In addition, we report that Tlg2p forms a SEC18-dependent SNARE complex with Snc2p, a vesicle SNARE known to function in Golgi to plasma membrane trafficking. Based on these findings we propose that Tlg2p is a t-SNARE that functions in transport from the endosome to the late Golgi and on the endocytic pathway.

Based on these findings we propose that Tlg2p is a t-SNARE that functions in transport from the endosome to the late Golgi and on the endocytic pathway. The intracellular flux of lipids and proteins that constitutes vesicular trafficking in eukaryotic cells is a highly regulated process. The correct sorting of these components defines cellular compartmentalization and is thus vital for cellular function (1Rothman J.E. Warren G. Curr. Biol. 1994; 4: 220-233Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Our understanding of the control of intracellular membrane fusion has been highlighted in recent years by the formulation of the SNARE 1The abbreviations used are: SNARE, solubleN-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor; t-SNARE, target SNARE; v-SNARE, vesicle SNARE; NSF,N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor; CPY, carboxypeptidase Y; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HA, hemagglutinin. hypothesis. Integral membrane proteins residing on different membrane-bound compartments (e.g. synaptic vesicles and plasma membrane) called t- and v-SNAREs are able to interact, and this interaction and its function are conserved from yeast to man (2Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar, 3Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T.

Jahn R. Nature. 1994; 370: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The complex formed between SNAREs is thought to span the lipid bilayers of both interacting compartments and to play a pivotal role in the docking and fusion processes. In agreement with this suggestion, a number of toxins that abrogate synaptic transmission do so by site-specific proteolysis of SNARE proteins (6Blasi J. Chapman E.R. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Niemann H. Jahn R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4821-4828Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 7Blasi J. Chapman E.R. Link E. Binz T. Yamasaki S. De Camilli P. Sudhof T.C. Niemann H. Jahn R.

Nature. 1992; 359: 832-835Crossref PubMed Scopus (1459) Google Scholar), and antibodies to SNARE complex proteins inhibitin vitro membrane fusion assays (9Lian J.P. Ferro-Novick S. Cell. 1993; 73: 735-745Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Complex formation between t-SNARE proteins on the target membrane and v-SNARE proteins on the vesicle membrane is thought to be modulated by a cycle of multiprotein complex assembly and disassembly that involves a number of accessory proteins (2Sollner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar). NSF, a multimeric ATPase, interacts with SNAREs via soluble NSF attachment proteins in an ATP-dependent manner. Hydrolysis of ATP by NSF induces conformational changes in SNAREs that lead to the disassembly of the SNARE complex. Recent data have indicated that this cycle may function at a point prior to docking, in rearranging intramembrane, inactive SNARE complexes (10Mayer A. Wickner W. Haas A. Cell. 1996; 85: 83-94Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). A basic implication of the SNARE hypothesis is that the fate of any patch of membrane, be it a transport vesicle or cellular compartment, is determined at least in part by the set of v- and/or t-SNAREs that are present on its surface (3Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). As such, an interesting question arises as to the precise fashion by which SNARE content correlates with membrane flux. It was originally suggested that t-SNAREs and v-SNAREs interact in a specific and exclusive fashion (11Bennett M.K. Garcia-Arraras J.E. Elferink L.A. Peterson K. Fleming A.M. Hazuka C.D. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 863-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 12Calakos N. Bennett M.K. Peterson K.E. R. H., S. Science. 1994; 263: 1146-1149Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) and that this specificity underlies the fidelity of vesicular transport. It has since been demonstrated, however, that a single v-SNARE can function at two different transport steps, with different t-SNAREs specific for each transport step (13Fischer von Mollard G. Nothwehr S.F. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1511-1524Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). These findings have been accommodated within the SNARE model by suggesting that specificity arises out of additional, uncharacterized interactions that modulate the t-SNARE/v-SNARE coupling. In the endocytic vacuolar system of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the endosome (also known as the prevacuolar compartment) is a point of convergence for membrane traffic originating in the Golgi complex and in the plasma membrane (14Vida T. Huyer A.G. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1245-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 15Piper R.C. Cooper A.A. Yang H. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131(3): 603-617Crossref Scopus (342) Google Scholar). It has been shown that Pep12p, a yeast protein that is homologous to the prototypical mammalian t-SNARE syntaxin, acts as a t-SNARE required for docking and/or fusion of Golgi-derived vesicles with the endosome/prevacuolar compartment (16Becherer K.A. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. Jones E.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar, 17Burd C.G. Peterson M. Cowles C.R. Emr S.D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1089-1104Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). It has also been shown that delivery of pheromone receptors to the prevacuolar compartment requires the action of the NSF ATPase, Sec18p (18Hicke L. Zanolari B. Pypaert M. Rohrer J. Riezman H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 13-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). In this paper we describe a new syntaxin homologue, Tlg2p, which fractionates in a bimodal fashion with protein markers for the endosome and late Golgi compartments in density gradients and is required for efficient endocytosis. Unlike Pep12p, tlg2Δ cells do not accumulate the p2 form of the vacuolar protease carboxypeptidase Y (CPY) but missort a fraction of p2 CPY to the cell surface. We suggest that Tlg2p is a t-SNARE that is required in trafficking from the prevacuolar compartment to the late Golgi or alternatively for endocytosis-related membrane fusion events.

Using two nested gene SOEing reactions, the TLG2 promoter region was fused to the GFP open reading frame, and the product of this reaction was in turn fused in-frame with the TLG2 coding sequence and 3′ untranslated region. The flanking regions of this construct are identical with those of theXbaI-SacI fragment mentioned above, and the linear PCR product was inserted into pRS305 as before. Plasmid pHAB15 was constructed by cloning an Eco47III-BclI PCR amplified URA3 gene into the Eco47III andBclI sites of the TLG2 gene, in pHAB36.

The HA-SNC2gene was PCR amplified using a PstI primer 49 base pairs upstream of the 5′ end of the coding sequence and a HindIII primer 1351 base pairs downstream of the 3′ end of the coding sequence. The PCR product was subcloned into pNRB529, a pRS305-based yeast expression vector containing GAL1 promoter andADH terminator sequences.

Briefly, 4 OD units of cells from a culture grown to A 600 of 0.5 were collected, treated for 10 min at room temperature with 100 mm Tris, pH 9.4, 10 mm dithiothreitol, washed, and resuspended in spheroplasting medium (SD plus nutrients, 1.2m sorbitol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 200 μg/ml zymolyase 100T). The cells were incubated with gentle agitation at 25 °C for 30 min. Spheroplasts were collected, washed with SD medium supplemented with 1.2 m sorbitol and auxotrophic requirements, and incubated in the same medium at 25 °C for 10 min. Labeling was initiated by adding 200 μCi 35S PRO-MIX™ ([35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine at 14.4 mCi/ml; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). After a 5-min labeling period, chase was initiated by adding cysteine and methionine to 1 and 5 mm respectively, plus 0.2% yeast extract and 4% glucose (time 0). Samples of 1 A 600 cell equivalent in 100 μl were taken at 0, 10, 30, and 90 min after initiation of chase, brought to 5 mm NaN3, and cooled in ice. Samples were spun to separate intracellular and extracellular fractions. The spheroplast pellets were brought to 100 μl with SD supplemented with 1.2 m sorbitol and 5 mm NaN3, and all fractions were immediately precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid, 0.015% deoxycholate. The precipitates were washed twice with acetone, resuspended in SDS boiling buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA) and boiled for 5 min. The lysates were diluted with dilution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 2% Triton X-100, 0.1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl) and immunoprecipitated with anti-CPY antibody. The immunoprecipitates were resolved by SDS-PAGE and 35S-labeled CPY was visualized and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager™ and ImageQuant™ software. The colony-lift immunoblotting technique (24Roberts C.J. Raymond C.K. Yamashiro C.T. Stevens T.H. Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Guide to Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Academic Press, New York1991: 644-661Google Scholar) was used to assay gross CPY release from cells. Lucifer Yellow uptake was assayed as described previously (25Dulic V. Egerton M. Elguindi I. Raths S. Singer B. Riezman H. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 679-710Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 ml of logarithmically growing yeast cells cells (5 × 106cells/ml in YEPD) were collected and resuspended in 900 μl of YEPD. 100 μl of Lucifer Yellow stock solution was added to a final concentration of 4 mg/ml, and the cells were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C with vigorous shaking. The cells were then washed three times in ice-cold buffer (50 mm succinate-NaOH, pH 5.0, 20 mm NaN3) and mounted in 0.8% low melt agarose. The cells were observed using a Zeiss axiophot microscope equipped with fluorescence and Nomarski optics. Photographs were taken using Kodak T-Max 400 film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Ste3p endocytosis and Pronase sensitivity assays were done as described by Davis et al.(26Davis N.G. Horecka J.L. Sprague G.F. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 53-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). For viewing GFP-tagged proteins, logarithmically growing cells were fixed by suspension in −20 °C methanol followed by −20 °C acetone and finally resuspended in TE (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA). Cells were mounted in 0.8% low melting point agar and viewed using a Zeiss Axiophot microscope equipped with a 100× Apochromat objective. For fluorescence imaging of living cells, cells were mounted in YEPD medium containing 0.8% low melting point agarose and viewed using a Zeiss Axiovert 10 microscope coupled to a Bio-Rad MRC600 confocal laser apparatus and equipped with a 63× Apochromat objective. Cell were grown to early log phase in YEPD or YEPG medium, pelleted, and resuspended in medium pre-warmed to 25 or 37 °C. After a 10-min incubation, the cells were chilled to 4 °C by dilution into 10 volumes of ice-cold Tris buffer (10 mm, pH 7.4) and collected by centrifugation. The pellets were resuspended in HKDNE buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EDTA) supplemented with 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and then homogenized by vortexing for 3 min with acid washed glass beads. The homogenates were diluted to 1 mg/ml protein and then cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 16,000 × g. Affinity purified anti-Tlg2p antibody was added to the supernatant and incubated for 6 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were collected on protein G-Sepharose beads, washed five times with HKDNE buffer, electrophoresed on an SDS 12% polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose. The protein blot was probed with an anti-Snc1p antisera that cross-reacts with Snc2p (27Rossi G. Salminen A. Rice L.M. Brunger A. Brennwald P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16610-16617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and detected by ECL. HA-Snc2p, which comigrates on the gel with antibody light chains, was detected with biotinylated 12CA5 (anti-HA) antibody and streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase. FM4-64 uptake was essentially as described (28Vida T.A. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 779-792Crossref PubMed Scopus (1141) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown to an A 600 of 0.5 and 10 OD units were collected and resuspended in 5 ml of ice-cold YEPD containing 0.6 μm FM4-64 (Molecular Probes). After a 30-min incubation on ice with shaking, the cells were collected again and resuspended in 5 ml of ice-cold YEPD. The cells were then incubated at 15 °C for an additional 30 min for visualization of uptake intermediates or at 30 °C for vacuolar staining. Cells showing punctate staining after incubation at 15 °C were further incubated for 20 min at 30 °C to produce vacuolar staining patterns. Cells were mounted in 0.8% low melting agarose and visualized as above. 600 A 600units of logarithmically growing yeast culture in YEPD were spun in the presence of 10 mm NaN3 and resuspended in 100 mm Tris, pH 9.4, 10 mm dithiothreitol, and 10 mm NaN3. The cells were incubated at room temperature for 10 min, collected, and resuspended in 12 ml of spheroplasting buffer (SPB buffer: 1.5 m sorbitol, 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.2, 2 mm MgCl, 10 mm NaN3, and 0.2 mg/ml Zymolyase 100T) and incubated for 60 min at 30 °C with gentle shaking. Spheroplasts were cooled on ice (all subsequent handling was done at 4 °C unless stated otherwise) and centrifuged for 5 min at 700 × gthrough a cushion of SPB buffer without zymolyase and containing 1.9m sorbitol. The pellet was resuspended in 12 ml of lysis buffer (50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 5 mm EDTA, 0.2 m sorbitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml each of leupeptin, chymostatin, aprotinin, pepstatin A, and antipain), and the cells were lysed with a Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 700 × g for 5 min. Low speed supernatant and low speed pellet were generated by a 15-min centrifugation at 13,000 × g. The low speed supernatant fraction was centrifuged for 1 h at 100,000 ×g to generate high speed supernatant and high speed pellet fractions. Equivalent volumes of each fraction were used for SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis. 1 ml of high speed pellet fraction (120A 600 unit equivalents) in lysis buffer was loaded on a sucrose step gradient and fractionated as described (16Becherer K.A. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. Jones E.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). Tlg2p and Pep12p were detected by standard immunoblot technique. Kex2p activity was assayed according to Fuller et al. (29Fuller R.S. Brake A. Thorner J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 86: 1434-1438Crossref Scopus (286) Google Scholar) using t-butoxycarbonyl-Gln-Arg-Arg 4-methylcoumarin-7-amide as substrate and following the evolution of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin by fluorescence (385 nm excitation wavelength, 465 nm emission wavelength). One unit of Kex2p activity was defined as 1 pmol of 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin released per minute. Spheroplast preparation was as described above. Spheroplasts were lysed by Dounce homogenizing in 0.3m mannitol, 0.1 m KCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, and clarified extracts were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. Protease protection assays (16Becherer K.A. Rieder S.E. Emr S.D. Jones E.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 579-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) were conducted on the 100,000 × g pellet fraction. Membrane pellets (80 μg of protein) were resuspended in lysis buffer and incubated with combinations of 0.29 mg/ml proteinase K and/or 0.4% Triton X-100 for 5 min, and then the reactions were quenched with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Samples (15 μg of protein) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting for Kar2p and Tlg2p. We scanned the yeast data base for proteins showing similarity to the conserved juxta-membrane coiled-coil domain of Sed5p, a known syntaxin-like yeast t-SNARE that is localized to the Golgi and required for membrane traffic between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex (30Hardwick K.G. Pelham H.R. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 513-521Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). An open reading frame (YOL018c), located on chromosome XV, was found to encode a novel syntaxin-like protein. Unlike other members of the syntaxin family, the predicted transmembrane domain encoded by this sequence is not at the C terminus of the open reading frame. Rather, it is followed by a hydrophilic stretch of 63 amino acids that shows no obvious homology to known proteins or motifs. Pep12p and Vam3p are the highest scoring yeast proteins that are found when searching the data base with the BLAST program using the new open reading frame as query (P scores of 7.9e−19 and 1.3e−11, respectively). During preparation of this manuscript, YOL018c was designated Tlg2p in the yeast data base, and we have chosen to follow this nomenclature. The similarity between Pep12p, Vam3p, and Tlg2p is illustrated in Fig. 1. It is evident that these three proteins share features beyond those within the conserved membrane-proximal coiled-coil domain that defines the syntaxin family of proteins (31Weimbs T. Hui Low S. Chapin S.J. Mostov K.E. Bucher P. Hoffman K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3046-3051Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). For example, all three proteins have transmembrane domains of 18 amino acids and show a high degree of sequence identity within the transmembrane domain region. Although the transmembrane domain is constrained to hydrophobic amino acids, its length, amino acid composition, and sequence have been shown to be important in localization and function of t-SNAREs (32Rayner J. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1832-1841Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To disruptTLG2, SFNY562 diploid yeast were transformed with theXbaI-SalI TLG2 disruption cassette. Dissection of tetrads from these cells gave four viable spores, and the absence of Tlg2p from the Ura+ haploid segregants was confirmed by Western blotting. The high degree of similarity between Tlg2p and t-SNAREs of the vacuolar endocytic pathway led us to ask iftlg2Δ yeast show phenotypes characteristic of abnormalities in those cellular functions. Yeast defective in vacuolar endocytic trafficking often show sensitivity to osmotic stress (33Banta L.M. Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1369-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar) and defects in the sorting of vacuolar proteases (23Raymond C.K. Howald-Stevenson I. Vater C.A. Stevens T.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1389-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar, 33Banta L.M. Robinson J.S. Klionsky D.J. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 1369-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). In 40 tetrads scored, the Ura+ phenotype marking the tlg2disruption segregated 2:2 and co-segregated with a growth defect at ambient temperatures (20–25 °C) on rich medium containing 1m NaCl (Fig. 2 a). Colony filter assays for CPY missorting showed that these same segregants also released CPY to the extracellular medium. In addition, light microscopic analysis revealed that tlg2Δ yeast had abnormally fragmented vacuoles. Detection of extracellular CPY by the colony filter assay could be the consequence of cell lysis, secretion of the late Golgi (p2) form, or some other mechanism. The mobility of CPY in SDS gels can be used as a gauge of intracellular location within its biosynthetic route in the cell. Upon translocation to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, CPY is glycosylated by the addition of fourN-linked core oligosaccharides, and this precursor form of the protein, called p1 CPY, migrates as 67 kDa in SDS-PAGE. As CPY transits through the later compartments of the Golgi complex, it acquires additional mannose residues to give rise to p2 CPY, which migrates at 69 kDa. Upon delivery to the vacuole, the 90-amino acid propeptide on p2 CPY is proteolysed, giving rise to the 61-kDa mature form of the protein (mCPY) (34Stevens T. Esmon B. Schekman R. Cell. 1982; 30: 439-448Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). We performed pulse-chase analysis of CPY maturation to understand the origin of the extracellular CPY intlg2Δ cells. Spheroplasts were formed, pulsed for 5 min with 35S-PRO-MIX™, and chased for various times as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We found that CPY maturation in tlg2Δ cells is not blocked. Althoughtlg2Δ cells were slightly delayed in the appearance of the p2 form at very early time points (not shown), they processed p2 CPY to the mature vacuolar form within the same time frame as that of wild type cells (Fig. 2 c). However, approximately 20% of the total CPY synthesized was secreted from these cells as the Golgi-modified p2 form. Tlg2p is unique among members of the syntaxin family in possessing a sizeable, putatively lumenal, hydrophilic C-terminal domain. In an attempt to understand the function of this domain, we assayed the ability of a truncated form of Tlg2p lacking the C-terminal hydrophilic domain to complement the observed high salt growth defect and colony-lift CPY missorting assay phenotypes of the TLG2disruption. A termination codon was introduced at position 338 of the open reading frame as described above to form a mutant version of the gene encoding the truncated protein, Tlg2pΔ338. Cells deleted for endogenous TLG2 but carrying the truncated form express a protein of the predicted molecular weight that reacts with anti-Tlg2p antibody (Fig. 2 c). The integration vector carrying the truncated gene was introduced at the LEU2 locus of diploid TLG2/tlg2Δ cells, and the resultant transformants were sporulated and dissected. In the 35 tetrads examined, leucine prototrophy co-segregated with suppression of the high salt sensitive growth and the CPY missorting phenotypes, as shown for a typical tetratype tetrad in Fig. 2 a. Thus, although cells lacking full-length Tlg2p are deficient in growth on high salt and secrete p2 CPY, cells that express Tlg2pΔ338 instead of the normal form of the protein show wild type behavior. We therefore conclude that the C"

Two genes have been shown to be involved:CSA and CSB. Both proteins play an essential role in preferential repair of transcription-blocking lesions from active genes. In this study we report the purification and characterization of baculovirus-produced HA-His6-tagged CSB protein (dtCSB), using a highly efficient three-step purification protocol. Microinjection of dtCSB protein in CS-B fibroblasts shows that it is biologically functional in vivo. dtCSB exhibits DNA-dependent ATPase activity, stimulated by naked as well as nucleosomal DNA. Using structurally defined DNA oligonucleotides, we show that double-stranded DNA and double-stranded DNA with partial single-stranded character but not true single-stranded DNA act as efficient cofactors for CSB ATPase activity. Using a variety of substrates, no overt DNA unwinding by dtCSB could be detected, as found with other SNF2/SWI2 family proteins. By site-directed mutagenesis the invariant lysine residue in the NTP-binding motif of CSB was substituted with a physicochemically related arginine. As expected, this mutation abolished ATPase activity. Surprisingly, the mutant protein was nevertheless able to partially rescue the defect in recovery of RNA synthesis after UV upon microinjection in CS-B fibroblasts. These results indicate that integrity of the conserved nucleotide-binding domain is important for the in vivofunction of CSB but that also other properties independent from ATP hydrolysis may contribute to CSB biological functions.

Removal of these lesions proceeds via a multi-step reaction; lesion recognition is followed by local opening of the DNA helix, dual incision in the damaged strand on each side of the lesion, release of the damage-containing fragment, gap-filling DNA synthesis, and ligation. A large number of gene products is involved in this repair reaction (reviewed in Refs. 1Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Eur. J. Cancer. 1994; 30A: 1912-1921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 2Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. ASM Press, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar, 3Wood R.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 135-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). The dramatic consequences of impaired NER are illustrated by several hereditary human diseases including xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) and Cockayne syndrome (CS). Patients with XP manifest a high sun (UV) skin sensitivity associated with a strong predisposition to skin cancer and frequently progressive neurodegeneration. Besides these common features, a significant clinical and genetic heterogeneity is observed among XP patients. Seven excision-deficient complementation groups (XP-A to XP-G) have been identified so far on the basis of cell fusion experiments (4Bootsma D. Kraemer K.H. Cleaver J.E. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzel K. The Genetic Basis of Human Cancer. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1997Google Scholar). Patients with CS show, like XP, increased sensitivity to UV light. In addition, they suffer from severe developmental problems, which include growth retardation, skeletal and retinal abnormalities, and severe neurological deficiencies due to dysmyelination of neurons (4Bootsma D. Kraemer K.H. Cleaver J.E. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Vogelstein B. Kinzel K. The Genetic Basis of Human Cancer. McGraw-Hill Book Co., New York1997Google Scholar, 5Lehmann A.R.

Unlike XP patients and unlike a recently generated mouse model for CSB (7van der Horst G.T.J. van Steeg H. Berg R.J.W. van Gool A.J. De Wit J. Weeda G. Morreau H. Beems R.B. van Kreijl C.F. de Gruijl F.R. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Cell. 1997; 89: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), no significant skin cancer predisposition has been noted for CS so far. Several observations have revealed functional connections between DNA repair and basal transcription. Firstly, at least three subunits of the basal transcription factor TFIIH (XPB, XPD, and TTDA) are also required for NER (8Schaeffer L. Roy R. Humbert S. Moncollin V. Vermeulen W. Hoeijmakers J.H.J.

Biol. 1994; 59: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). Secondly, lesions in the transcribed strand of active genes hamper or block the vital process of transcription. For some lesions such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers the normal (global genome) NER pathway is very slow. Therefore, a special subpathway of NER has evolved that accomplishes rapid and efficient removal of these types of damage from the transcribed strand of active genes (11Bohr V.A. Smith C.A. Okumoto D.S. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1985; 40: 359-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1007) Google Scholar, 12Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C.

This process, called transcription-coupled repair is highly conserved in evolution, because it has been described in Escherichia coli, yeast and mammalian cells (7van der Horst G.T.J. van Steeg H.

In humans, two genes have been shown to be specifically required for transcription-coupled repair: CSA and CSB, defective in CS complementation groups A and B, respectively (17Henning K.a. Li L.

Consequently, unlike normal cells, they are unable to recover RNA synthesis after UV irradiation (19Venema J. Mullenders L.H.F. Natarajan A.T. van Zeeland A.A. Mayne L.V. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The CSB gene encodes a protein of 1493 amino acids containing a 500-amino acid region highly homologous to members of the SWI2/SNF2 subfamily of DNA-dependent ATPases (18Troelstra C. Van Gool A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 4713-4730Crossref PubMed Scopus (827) Google Scholar). Interestingly, SNF2-related proteins are involved in a wide variety of cellular functions, notably transcription regulation, chromatin remodelling, and all known multi-step DNA repair pathways, such as nucleotide excision repair of both transcribed and nontranscribed regions of the genome, post replication repair, and recombination repair (22Gorbalenya A.E. Koonin E.V. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 419-429Crossref Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 23Eisen J.A. Sweder K.S. Hanawalt P.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 2715-2723Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar). Importantly, we found recently that the CSB protein resides in a large molecular weight complex that includes RNA polymerase II but no transcription initiation factors (24van Gool A.J. Citterio E. Rademakers S. van Os R. Vermeulen W. Constantinou A. Egly J.M. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5955-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which CSB protein mediates transcription-coupled repair is still largely unknown. Availability of a recombinant CSB protein is essential for studying CSB activity in in vitroassays. Here we present the generation, purification, and functional characterization of a double-tagged wt and ATPase-deficient mutant CSB protein. Surprisingly, the DNA-dependent ATPase activity was found to be partially dispensable for the in vivo CSB function in RNA synthesis recovery. The immortalized human cell lines used in this study were: HeLa, C5RO (wt), GM2965 (CS-A), CS1AN (CS-B), and XPCS1BA(XP-B). The fibroblasts were cultured in Ham's F-10 medium, supplemented with antibiotics and 12% fetal calf serum. Cell-free extract from HeLa cells was prepared as described previously (25Manley J.L. Fire A. Samuels M. Sharp P.A. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 568-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar,26Wood R.D. Biggerstaff M. Shivji M.K.K. Methods: A Companion to Methods in Enzymology. 1995; 7: 163-175Crossref Scopus (70) Google Scholar). An insect cell line, Spodoptera frugiperda Sf21, was cultured at 27 °C in Hanks' medium supplemented with antibiotics and 10% fetal calf serum. Hanks' medium was prepared from Grace's insect cell culture medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 0.33% tissue culture yeastolate (Difco), 0.33% tissue culture lactalbumin hydrolysate (Difco), and 0.55% bovine serum albumin. Previously we have generated a CSB cDNA construct (2tpSLME6) encoding a N-terminal hemagglutinin antigen (HA) epitope as well as a C-terminal histidine (His6) tag (24van Gool A.J. Citterio E. Rademakers S. van Os R. Vermeulen W. Constantinou A. Egly J.M. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5955-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). For overexpression of the HA-CSB-His6 in the BAC to BAC Baculovirus Overexpression System (Life Technologies, Inc.), the N-terminal SacI fragment and the C-terminal SacI-XbaI fragment were cloned together in the pFASTBAC vector (Life Technologies, Inc.), giving rise to construct 2tpFBACE6. Construct 2tpFBACE6-K538R, containing a mutation changing the Lys-538 codon to Arg, was generated as described below. The K538R mutation in the CSB cDNA was introduced using the PCR-mediated site-directed mutagenesis method (27Barettino D. Feigenbutz M. Valcarcel R. Stunnenberg H.G. Nucleic Acid Res. 1993; 22: 541-542Crossref Scopus (108) Google Scholar). For this purpose, two fragments of the CSB cDNA containing the helicase domain (1330-base pairKpnI-SmaI fragment and 1914-base pairKpnI-KpnI fragment) were independently subcloned into pBluescript KS and pTZ18 vector, respectively. The primers used in the PCR reactions are: the mutagenic primer (5′ GGATTGGGCAGGACCATCCAG 3′) and the universal primers SK and M13 universal. The final PCR product was cloned into the pBluescript vector, and the internalAsuII fragment was used to replace the wild-type fragment in 2tpFASTBACE6. Sequencing of the entire PCR fragment ruled out PCR-derived errors and confirmed the presence of the desired mutation. Suspension cultures of Sf21 cells at 1.5 × 106 cells/ml were infected with the recombinant baculoviruses at 27 °C for 1 h at a multiplicity of infection of 5–10. At 3 days post-infection, cells were collected and washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. For fractionation, the cell pellet was resuspended into 8 (packed cell) volumes of ice-cold NP lysis buffer (25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 1 mmEDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.3 m KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0,1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0,2 μm chemostatin, leupeptin, antipain, and pepstatin A). After incubation on ice for 30 min with occasional agitation, the suspension was centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 15 min to obtain the supernatant fraction and the precipitate fraction. To examine the protein remaining in the precipitate fraction, the pellets were homogenized in NP buffer by sonication. For purification, the supernatant fraction was diluted with NP buffer at pH 6,8 in a 1:1 ratio and loaded on a heparin-Sepharose (CL-6B; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated with buffer A (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7, 9, 0,01% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 0, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) containing 0.3 m KCl. The column was washed with the same buffer, and the adsorbed proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 0.8 m KCl. The eluate was directly loaded on a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column equilibrated with buffer A containing 0.8 m KCl and 5 mm imidazole. After washing the column with 20 mm Imidazole, bound proteins were eluted with buffer A containing 0.3 m KCl and 60 mm/250 mm imidazole. In the final step of purification, the Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid elution fractions were incubated with a 5-fold excess of monoclonal anti-HA (12CA5) antibody O/N at 4 °C with rotation. The protein-antibody complexes were subsequently bound to protein G-Sepharose beads. After extensive washing of the beads with buffer A containing 0,1% Nonidet P-40, CSB protein was specifically eluted using the synthetic HA peptide (YPYDVPDYA) at 1 mg/ml in buffer A containing 0.2 m KCl. Proteins were stored at −80 °C. The behavior of the recombinant protein during the purification was monitored by SDS-PAGE and immunoblot blot analysis. Standard reactions (10 μl) were carried out in buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 4 mmMgCl2, 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mmdithiothreitol), 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (5000 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the specified amounts of CSB protein. When indicated, reactions were carried out in the same buffer B supplemented with 50 μm cold ATP and 0.25 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. 150 ng of DNA cofactor/reaction was added. After 1 h at 30 °C the reactions were stopped with 5 μl of 0.5 m EDTA, and a 1-μl sample was analyzed on polyethylenimine-cellulose thin layer chromatography plates developed in 0.75 m KH2PO4. The extent of ATP hydrolysis was determined by image analysis and quantification on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The partial duplex DNA substrates were constructed by hybridizing a 5′ 32P-labeled complementary fragment to the viral (+)-strand of M13 DNA: (i) 18-base oligonucleotide; (ii) 36-base oligonucleotide; (iii) 50-base oligonucleotide with a 5′ 15-base noncomplementary overhang; and (iv) 50-base oligonucleotide with a 3′ 15-base noncomplementary overhang. Helicase substrates with a 5′-3′ and a 3′-5′ polarity were made by hybridizing a 5′-32P-labeled complementary fragment to a 36-base oligonucleotide (F36), respectively: (i) 19-base oligonucleotide (F19) and (ii) 17-base oligonucleotide (F17) (see TableI). Also, a double-stranded 75-base DNA fragment was used. Free oligonucleotides were removed by gel filtration on a Sephadex G50 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column. The substrates, 5 ng each, were incubated with the indicated amount of CSB protein in buffer B containing 1 mm ATP (total volume 25 μl). After incubation at 37 °C for 45 min, reactions were stopped and subjected to electrophoresis on 12% polyacrylamide gel and autoradiography as described (8Schaeffer L. Roy R. Humbert S. Moncollin V.

Comparable amounts of purified recombinant CSB, wild type, and K538R mutant dissolved at 20 ng/μl were injected into the cytoplasm of CS1AN (CS-B) homopolykaryons (obtained after cell fusion of CS1AN (CS-B) fibroblasts with each other), multinucleated cells of GM2965 (CS-A), or XPCS1BA (XP-B) homopolykaryons. The recovery of RNA synthesis post-UV was measured. Cells were UV-irradiated with 10 or 15 J/m2 (UV-C 254 nm) and allowed to recover for 16–20 h. RNA synthesis was measured after pulse-labeling with [3H]uridine (10 μCi/ml; specific activity, 50 Ci/mmol), fixation, and autoradiography. Grains above the nuclei of injected cells (polykaryons) and noninjected neighboring cells (monokaryons) were counted and represent a quantitative measure for RNA synthesis. Anti-CSB antibodies used in this study were raised against the C-terminal 158 amino acids of CSB. Characterization of affinity-purified anti-CSB and immunoblotting procedures were performed as described (24van Gool A.J. Citterio E. Rademakers S. van Os R. Vermeulen W. Constantinou A. Egly J.M. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5955-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar).

Chem. 1998; 273: 7835-7842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). HeLa polynucleosomes were a generous gift of Robert Kingston and Gavin Schnitzler. To facilitate purification of CSB and to allow isolation of a full-length protein, we generated a double-tagged CSB (dtCSB) construct (24van Gool A.J. Citterio E. Rademakers S. van Os R. Vermeulen W. Constantinou A. Egly J.M. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5955-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar) in a baculovirus expression system. A 9-amino acid HA epitope was introduced at the N terminus of the cDNA sequence, and a hexameric histidine stretch (His6) was introduced at the C terminus. It was important to verify whether the addition of tagsper se did not interfere with the biological function of CSB. Therefore, we established by cDNA transfection a CS-B cell line stably expressing dtCSB in a mammalian expression vector. The level of expression of dtCSB protein was similar to the endogenous CSB level in normal cells. We found that the tagged protein conferred wild-type UV resistance to the CS-B cells and was incorporated into a large complex including RNA polymerase II (see Ref. 24van Gool A.J. Citterio E. Rademakers S. van Os R. Vermeulen W. Constantinou A. Egly J.M. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5955-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Thus, these findings confirm that dtCSB was biologically active in vivoand functionally indistinguishable from the untagged wt protein. To investigate the importance of the ATPase activity for the various CSB functions we introduced by site-directed mutagenesis a strategic amino acid substitution in the Walker-type A motif (30Walker J.E. Saraste M. Runswick M.J. Gay N.J. EMBO J. 1982; 1: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (4234) Google Scholar) by replacing the invariant lysine residue (Lys-538) in the GXGKT sequence by the physicochemically related arginine, yielding dtCSB (K538R). It has been shown for other ATPases that such an alteration does prevent ATP hydrolysis but still permits ATP binding (31Sung P. Higgins D. Prakash L. Prakash S. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3263-3269Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar, 32Notarnicola S.M. Richardson C.C. J. Biol.

Importantly, this conservative amino acid change is not expected to drastically modify the overall protein conformation. Both the wild-type and the mutant CSB protein were overproduced using the baculovirus/Sf21 insect cell system. Infected Sf21 cells were extracted with hypertonic buffer containing 0.3m KCl, and the dtCSB protein was isolated from the soluble fraction. The purification was monitored by immunoblot analysis using polyclonal anti-CSB antibodies and by silver staining of SDS-PAGE. After two chromatographic steps, a heparin-Sepharose and a Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column that selects for the C-terminal His6 stretch, we obtained a protein fraction consisting of a major band of about 170 kDa, corresponding to the predicted molecular weight of dtCSB (Fig.1, A and B,lanes 1–3). Some degradation products were visible after immunoblot analysis using antibodies raised against the C terminus of CSB (data not shown; similar findings made by Selby and Sancar (34Selby C.P. Sancar A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1885-1890Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar)). The presence of an HA epitope at the N terminus of dtCSB allowed us to select only for full-length protein during the last highly specific monoclonal affinity purification step. When the final fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining, no protein species other than dtCSB were detected, indicating that the protein was purified to near homogeneity (Fig. 1 B, lane 4). The same purification procedure was used for both wild-type dtCSB and dtCSB (K538R) mutant, obtaining both proteins at comparable high levels of purity, intactness, concentration, and yield (Fig. 1 C). The three-step purification scheme described above yielded about 22 μg of protein from 108 infected cells. Immunoblot analysis of purified wt and mutant dtCSB and HeLa WCE using antibodies against CSB confirms the identity of the purified proteins (Fig. 1 D, note the slight increase in size of the dtCSB as compared with the nontagged wt CSB in HeLa whole cell extract; for characterization of the antiserum, see Ref. 24van Gool A.J. Citterio E. Rademakers S. van Os R. Vermeulen W. Constantinou A. Egly J.M. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5955-5965Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Prior to the biochemical characterization of the recombinant dtCSB protein, it was important to verify whether overproduction in the heterologous Baculo system and/or the purification procedure had not inactivated the biological function of the protein, e.g. by improper folding or lack of post-translational modification. One of the characteristic features of CS cells is their inability to recover RNA synthesis after UV exposure (18Troelstra C. Van Gool A. De Wit J. Vermeulen W. Bootsma D. Hoeijmakers J.H.J. Cell. 1992; 71: 939-953Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar, 35Mayne L.V. Lehmann A.R. Cancer Res. 1982; 42: 1473-1478PubMed Google Scholar). To assess thein vivo function of the recombinant wt CSB, the purified protein was microinjected into the cytoplasm of living CS-B (CS1AN) fibroblasts, and its ability to transiently correct the DNA repair defect of CS-B cells was analyzed. The experimental protocol is outlined in Fig. 2 A. CS1AN (CS-B) fibroblasts were fused to generate homopolykaryons. After injection of at least 50 multi-nucleated fibroblasts, the cells were irradiated with 15J/m2 UV light and incubated for 16–20 h to allow recovery from UV-induced inhibition of RNA synthesis. Transcription was analyzed by a 1-h pulse labeling with [3H]uridine followed by autoradiography. Transcription levels were quantified by counting silver grains above the nuclei (10Vermeulen W.

As shown in Table II and Fig.2 B, in injected CS-B polykaryons the recovery of UV-induced inhibition of transcription is resumed to levels observed in wild-type cells assayed in parallel. In contrast, the neighboring noninjected cells (monokaryons in Fig. 2 B), exhibit a very low level of transcription, which is typical for UV-exposed CS-B fibroblasts.Table IIEffect of microinjection of recombinant dtCSB protein on RNA synthesis recoveryCell strainComplementation groupInjected protein2-aRecombinant dtCSB protein purified from insect cells (see Fig. 1).

Open table in a new tab When CSB was microinjected in CS-A and XP-B fibroblasts, no significant complementation of their RNA-synthesis recovery defect was observed, proving that the correcting activity is specific for CS-B cells (TableII). These experiments demonstrate that the purified recombinant dtCSB protein is able to exert its biological function(s) in vivo, including transportation to the nucleus and participation in recovery of RNA synthesis, thus presumably also in transcription-coupled repair and complex formation with RNA polymerase II (24van Gool A.J.

In the case of “dry” epithelia such as foreskin epidermis and the hair cuticle for example, the CE consists of two parts, a protein envelope (about 15 nm or 5 nm thick, respectively) and a lipid envelope about 5 nm thick (7Swartzendruber D.C.

J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12035-12046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar), but their mode of covalent attachment is not yet resolved.Emerging data suggest that certain proteins are common components of the CEs formed by many if not all mammalian epithelial cell types, including in particular involucrin and perhaps the desmosomal-related proteins desmoplakin and envoplakin (19Steinert P.M.

On the other hand, a variety of data have suggested that CEs from different epithelia are not the same. Early studies showed that CEs formed in cultured keratinocytes or in abnormal psoriatic epidermis are “fragile” in comparison to those from normal cornified epidermis (24Simon M. Green H. Cell. 1984; 36: 827-834Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 25Michel S. Schmidt R. Robinson S.M. Shroot B. Reichert U. J. Invest.

Invest Dermatol. 1988; 91: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). More recent analyses of the amino acid compositions of CEs from a variety of tissues have suggested that these physical properties are probably a result of significant differences in the amounts of the several structural proteins listed above (10Jarnik M. Kartasova T. Steinert P.M. Lichti U. Steven A.C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1381-1391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Yoneda K. Steinert P.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Thus, a current view holds that CEs formed in different stratified squamous epithelia may be built from a common scaffold, but the proteins selected for the subsequent reinforcement of this may vary widely (4Hohl H.

For example, whereas loricrin is the major component of epidermal CEs, those from cultured epidermal keratinocytes in contrast contain much less loricrin (21Steven A.C. Steinert P.M. J.

Together, these observations have led to the suggestion that the physical and mechanical attributes of the CE and thus the entire epithelium may be determined in part by the selection of proteins, including the SPRs, used to reinforce the CE structure.Our preliminary data have revealed that mouse forestomach CEs contain about 95 nmol of cross-link/mg of total protein, which is one of the highest content of any TGase cross-linked product known to date, and corresponds to about one cross-link/100 amino acid residues. Accordingly, it is a useful structure to examine in order to better understand the physical barrier properties of CEs in general. In the present report, we have characterized the cross-linked proteins of mouse forestomach CEs to determine whether novel proteins might be involved in the cross-linking of this particularly toughened CE, whether loricrin and SPRs are cross-linked together in the same way and by the same residue positions as is known to occur in foreskin epidermal CEs, and to explore the role of the SPRs in CE structure. Our data offer novel insights into the roles of cross-bridging SPRs; the amounts present may modulate the biomechanical properties of the CEs and their epithelial tissue of origin.DISCUSSIONRodent forestomach is used as a primary storage of food prior to initiation of digestion. It is an especially flexible yet toughened epithelium, which has evolved to withstand vigorous mechanical abrasion as well as large expansions on ingestion and then contraction on digestion of food. It is a cornifying epithelium, which shares certain biochemical features with the epidermis, including the abundant expression of the keratin intermediate filament chains 1 and 10, profilaggrin, loricrin, SPR proteins, and the TGase 1–3 enzymes (10Jarnik M. Kartasova T. Steinert P.M. Lichti U. Steven A.C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1381-1391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,41Schweitzer J. Rentrop M. Nischt R. Kinjo M. Winter H. Cell Tissue Res. 1988; 253: 221-229PubMed Google Scholar).2 Furthermore, like the epidermis, these epithelial cells are bound by a CE consisting of a highly cross-linked amalgam of several shared proteins, and perhaps covalently bound lipids (10Jarnik M. Kartasova T. Steinert P.M. Lichti U. Steven A.C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1381-1391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we have identified a correlation between the SPR content of the CEs and the tough physical barrier requirements of the forestomach. The data presented here provide novel evidence for the role of SPRs, and perhaps THH, in the determination of the biomechanical properties of the forestomach epithelium, which has important significance for the epidermis as well as all other epithelia where SPRs are expressed.The SPRs Function as Cross-bridging Proteins by Use of Only the Head and Tail Domains for Cross-linkingSPRs consist of a heterogeneous population of proteins for which the primary functions identified to date are as CE structural proteins. However, the way in which they function and the consequences of their presence are not yet understood. In mouse (Fig. 3), as in other mammalian species, the SPR3 class consists of one protein and contains Lys- and Gln-rich amino- and carboxyl-terminal domains, separated by a central domain containing about 23 conserved eight-residue peptide repeats. The SPR1 class consists of two known members in mouse, which have Lys- and Gln-rich termini that are homologous to those of SPR3 and differ by having a central domain composed of 13 (SPR1a) or 14 (SPR1b) eight-residue repeats of sequence rather different from those of SPR3 (36Kartasova T. Darwiche K. Kohno Y. Koizumi H. Osada S. Huh N. Lichti U. Steinert P.M. Kuroki T. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 294-304Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The mouse SPR2 class consists of at least eight different genes that also have Lys- and Gln-rich termini, which are generally homologous to the other SPRs, but their central domains contain a different nine-residue proline-rich motif repeated 3.5–9 times.2 In all SPRs, the central peptide repeats contain multiple Gln and Lys residues. Several earlier reports have documented that SPRs are good substrates for cross-linking by TGases, and that at least some members can be oligomerized by membrane fractions containing the TGase 1 or TGase 2 enzyme in vitro (32Marvin K.W.

Dermatol. 1997; 108: 200-204Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The present analyses of a large number of cross-linked peptides involving the SPRs have provided direct and novel information on the way in which they are utilizedin vivo.Notably, the present mouse (Fig. 4) and earlier human (18Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17702-17711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 19Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2021-2030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) data on peptides derived from CEs reveal that only those Gln and Lys residues located on the termini are used for cross-linking in vivo. On this basis, we propose the use of the terms “head” and “tail” domains for the amino- and carboxyl termini, respectively, to designate these functional sequences (Figs. 3 and 4).Moreover, by careful adjustment of the degree of proteolytic digestion of the forestomach CEs, we were fortunate to obtain many multibranched peptides adjoined by two or more isopeptide cross-links, which have provided more information on their macromolecular associations and functions. First, we found that SPRs were cross-linked to virtually every other protein component of the CEs. Second, multiple adjacent Gln and Lys residues were utilized simultaneously on the same head or tail domain for inter- and perhaps intrachain cross-linking. Third, the head and tail domains were utilized approximately equally in cross-linking,i.e. the SPRs are functionally equivalent or directionally non-polar. Fourth, in every case involving an SPR protein in the multibranched peptides, the SPR functioned as a cross-bridge through either the head or tail domain (Table IV), or most commonly both. Thus, the available sequencing evidence indicates that SPRs function in vivo mainly as promiscuous bridging proteins spanning between other proteins (including themselves) in the CE structure, linked together through multiple isopeptide bonds.CEs Are a Composite Material: Modulation of Biomechanical Properties by the Cross-bridging SPR ProteinsWe show here that the protein portion of forestomach CE contains similar early scaffold proteins, including involucrin, envoplakins, and desmoplakin, and in similar amounts, as are found in foreskin epidermal CEs (Table I;cf. Ref. 19Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2021-2030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). However, it differs primarily in the mix of proteins which contribute the reinforcement components of CE structure. In the foreskin epidermal CE, loricrin + SPRs comprised about 85% of the total CE protein mass with a relative molar ratio of about 20:1 (Table V; Refs. 18Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17702-17711Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar, 19Steinert P.M. Marekov L.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2021-2030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, and 22Steinert P.M. Cell Death Diff. 1995; 2: 33-41PubMed Google Scholar). In the forestomach CE, although a similarly large amount of 88% was composed of loricrin + SPRs + THH, the relative molar ratios were about 3:1:0.2 (Table I), a variation made striking by the marked net increases in the SPRs and the first reported occurrence of THH. Furthermore, we have estimated the relative amounts of loricrin and SPRs in epidermal CEs recovered from a variety of body sites in mouse and human (Table VI). Again, we note that the sum of loricrin + SPRs was conserved at about 85%; however, notably, the ratio of loricrin:SPRs varied from >100:1 in thinner trunk epidermis to 4.5–7:1 in the thickened and toughened epidermis of the lip, callus, and footpad.Together, these data document a correlation between the amounts of SPRs in CEs of forestomach epithelium and epidermis from different body sites, and in the presumed physical properties and requirements of these tissues. Specifically, the forestomach of rodents and the epidermis of palm/sole, footpad, lip, etc., are subjected to considerably more mechanical abrasion and trauma during normal functions than other body sites such as the trunk.These data afford biochemical support for our earlier hypothesis on the role of SPRs as modifiers of a composite CE structure (10Jarnik M. Kartasova T. Steinert P.M. Lichti U. Steven A.C. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1381-1391Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Composite materials consist largely of a ground substance (in the present case, loricrin) and minor amounts of a cross-linking matrix substance (SPRs). For example, the properties of composites such as polyacrylamide gels can be widely varied by modest changes in the amount of cross-linkingbis-acrylamide (48Rodbard D. Chrambach A. Allen R.C. Maurer H.R. Electrophoresis and Isoelectric Focusing in Polyacrylamide Gels. Walter deGruyter, New York1974: 28-62mGoogle Scholar). Generally, increases in the cross-linker result in a more strengthened and/or toughened composite material (49Gerstle F.P. Krowschwitz J.I. Mark H.F. Bikales N.M. Overberger C.G. Menges G. Encylopedia of Polymer Science and Engineering. 3. John Wiley & Sons, New York1985: 254-278Google Scholar). In the case of CE structures, loricrin is thought to provide an insoluble (through inter- and intrachain isopeptide and disulfide bonds) yet flexible (because of the glycine loop sequence motifs) texture to the CE (17Hohl D.

https://openalex.org/W2038696130,"Sequence analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae chromosome IX identified a 946 amino acid open reading frame (YIL002C), designated here as INP51, that has carboxyl- and amino-terminal regions similar to mammalian inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatases and to yeast SAC1. This two-domain primary structure resembles the mammalian 5-phosphatase, synaptojanin. We report that Inp51p is associated with a particulate fraction and that recombinant Inp51p exhibits intrinsic phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 5-phosphatase activity. Deletion of INP51 (inp51) results in a “cold-tolerant” phenotype, enabling significantly faster growth at temperatures below 15 °C as compared with a parental strain. Complementation analysis of an inp51 mutant strain demonstrates that the cold tolerance is strictly due to loss of 5-phosphatase catalytic activity. Furthermore, deletion ofPLC1 in an inp51 mutant does not abrogate cold tolerance, indicating that Plc1p-mediated production of soluble inositol phosphates is not required. Cells lacking INP51have a 2–4-fold increase in levels of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, whereas cells overexpressing Inp51p exhibit a 35% decrease in levels of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. We conclude thatINP51 function is critical for proper phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate homeostasis. In addition, we define a novel role for a 5-phosphatase loss of function mutant that improves the growth of cells at colder temperatures without alteration of growth at normal temperatures, which may have useful commercial applications.

Of central importance to the inositol signaling pathway is phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), 1The abbreviations used are: PI(4,5)P2, phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; 5-ptase, 5-phosphatase; PIP, phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate; MIPC, mannosyl-inositol phosphorylceramide; M[IP]2C, mannosyldi-inositol diphosphorylceramide; IPC, inositol phosphorylceramides; bp, base pair; kb, kilobase pair; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; AF, ammonium formate; AP, ammonium phosphate; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; groPI, glycerophosphoinositols; PL, phospholipids. which serves as a precursor to second messengers and is a signaling molecule itself (1Berridge M.J.

Levels of PI(4,5)P2 are tightly maintained by a balance of kinase, lipase, transferase, and phosphatase activities. The importance of this regulation is manifested by disease states that arise as a result of mutation in these enzymes. For example, in Drosophiladeletion of the norpA phospholipase C β gene results in blindness (8Bloomquist B.T. Shortridge R.D. Schneuwly S. Perdew M. Montell C. Stellar H. Rubin G. Pak W.L.

In addition, the human disease oculocerebrorenal syndrome (Lowe's syndrome) arises from mutations in the OCRL-1 gene (11Attree O. Olivos I.M. Okabe I. Bailey L.C. Nelson D.L. Lewis R.A. McInnes R.R. Nussbaum R.L. Nature. 1992; 358: 239-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar), which encodes an inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (5-ptase) (12Zhang X. Jefferson A.B. Auethavekiat V. Majerus P.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4853-4856Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). 5-Ptase enzymes comprise a family of critical proteins that remove the 5-position phosphate from either soluble or lipid inositol polyphosphates, or both (reviewed in Refs. 13Majerus P.W.

Trans. 1996; 24: 994-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Initially, types I and II 5-ptases were postulated to terminate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate-mediated Ca2+ mobilization (15Connolly T.M. Bross T.E.

Cell Biol. 1987; 262: 2146-2149Google Scholar). However, recent characterization of several new 5-ptases provides evidence for their expanded role in cell function, including vesicular trafficking and Ras and cytokine signaling (13Majerus P.W.

The mammalian 5-ptase family consists of at least 10 distinct members and is identified by two short peptide motifs, “(i/l)W(l/f/m)GD(l/f)D(y/f)R” and “P(a/s)W(c/t/s)DRIL” (23Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 7890-7894Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).

It is unclear why so many 5-ptases exist and why in the case of Lowe's syndrome other 5-ptases are unable to compensate for defects in OCRL-1. To understand better the roles of 5-ptases in cell growth and in inositol metabolism in vivo, we initiated studies in a genetically tractable yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Several genes involved in yeast inositol lipid biosynthesis and metabolism have been identified (see reviews in Refs. 26Paltauf F. Kohlwein S.D. Henry S.A. Jones E.W. Pringle J.R. Broach J.R. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Yeast. 2. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1992: 415-500Google Scholar and 27Anderson M.S. Kanipes M.I. Jackson J.C. Yates J. Henry S.A. Lopes J.M. Yeast. 1995; 11: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In contrast, genes encoding inositol lipid phosphatases have not yet been defined. Importantly, the yeast genome sequencing project has enabled identification of open reading frames sharing similarity to mammalian inositol signaling genes. One such open reading frame, YIL002c, designated here as INP51, is highly similar to mammalian 5-ptases. We demonstrate that INP51 encodes a 108-kDa protein which has intrinsic PI(4,5)P2 5-ptase activity. Characterization of both loss and gain of function mutants ofinp51 demonstrates that 5-ptase activity is required for proper in vivo PI(4,5)P2 maintenance. Our studies also suggest a role for Inp51p-regulated inositol metabolites in the growth of yeast at cold temperatures. Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table I. The cells were propagated in standard rich (YPD) medium or in complete minimal medium (CM) containing either 2% glucose or galactose and, when appropriate, lacking the nutrient(s) to maintain selection for plasmids or markers. Standard procedures for yeast genetic manipulations were used (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology.

Strains were sporulated on 0.3% potassium acetate plates, and tetrads were dissected using a Zeiss Micromanipulator. The ability of a given yeast strain to propagate at temperatures below 15 °C was assessed by dispersing cells onto an appropriate solid media plate and, after incubation for 2 weeks, observing the resulting growth either visually or under a dissecting microscope, as appropriate.Table IYeast strains used in this studyStrainGenotypeReferenceW303MATa/MATα ade2–1/ade2–1 ura3–1/ura3–1 his3–11.15/his3–11,15 trp1–1/trp1–1 leu2–3,112/leu2–3,112 can1–100/can1–1001-aThe W303 strains were kindly provided by S.

Wente. Open table in a new tab TheINP51 gene was obtained from cosmid 9687 (the gift of Mark Johnston, Washington University, St. Louis) which contained a 21,431-bp segment of chromosome IX. The cosmid DNA was digested withSacI and PstI endonucleases, and the 3.8-kb fragment containing the INP51 locus was purified and subcloned into pBluescript II SK + (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to yield pBluINP51. The majority of the INP51 gene was removed and replaced with the selectable marker LEU2 (Fig.1 B). The LEU2 gene, obtained from anXbaI/PstI digestion of plasmid pJJ282 (obtained from Susan Wente, Washington University), was inserted at these sites into pBluINP51, to yield pinp51::LEU2. This plasmid DNA was linearized and transformed into W303 (MAT a/MAT α) cells (obtained from Susan Wente) by the standard Li+ acetate protocol (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). Stable Leu+ transformants were selected on Leu− plates and verified by Southern blot analysis (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar) of genomic DNA digested with KpnI and PvuII endonucleases and probed with a radiolabeled 1.2-kb INP51 SacI/XbaI fragment (see Fig. 1 B). Complementation analysis was performed using centromeric plasmids harboring either INP51 or INP51D788Aloci. Digestion of pBluINP51 with SacI andHindIII released a 3.8-kb INP51 locus, containing 775 bp of 5′-flanking sequence and the entire coding sequence, which was then inserted at these sites into pRS316 (Ref. 30Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; obtained from Susan Wente) to generate pRSINP51. The pRSINP51D788A plasmid was generated by a PCR-based mutagenesis approach in which the Asp788 codon GAT was converted to Ala788 codon GCT. Sense and antisense oligonucleotide 5′-AGATTTTGCGTACTAGTATCTCAT-3′ and 5′-TAACTGTTCTAGTACTTCTCCCCTACTTAAAACCTAGCTGTCCATGCTGGTAT-3′ were used to PCR-amplify the 400-bp mutant fragment under reaction conditions recommended by the manufacturer of the Taqpolymerase (Perkin-Elmer). The product was digested withSpeI and ScaI endonucleases, purified, and co-inserted along with a purified ScaI/HindIIIINP51 726-bp fragment into the SpeI andHindIII sites of pRSINP51 to yield pRSINP51D788A. The region of the pRSINP51D788A generated by PCR was sequenced to confirm that only the appropriate mutation was made. The pRSINP51 or pRSINP51D788A plasmids were transformed into haploid inp51 mutant cells by the standard Li+ acetate protocol (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar), and Ura+transformants were selected. A carboxyl-terminal peptide of Inp51p having the sequence “CVENEDEPLFIER” was chemically synthesized (Protein and Nucleic Acid Chemistry Lab, Washington University, St. Louis) and injected into rabbits using standard protocols (Pocono Rabbit Farm, Canadensis, PA). Immunoreactive antisera was affinity purified using peptide sulfolink-agarose gel (prepared according to Pierce) Soluble and particulate protein fractions were made from appropriate haploid yeast strains as follows. Approximately 3 × 108 cells were harvested at logarithmic phase by centrifugation (2,000 × g), washed twice in 1 ml of ice-cold water, and resuspended in 250 μl of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, supplemented with 10 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Lysis buffer). Cells were lysed by addition of 100 μl of acid-washed glass beads (425–600 μm diameter, Sigma) followed by vigorous reciprocal shaking (Mini Bead-BeaterTM, BioSpec, Inc., Bartlesville, OK) for 2 min. Lysates were centrifuged at 20,800 ×g for 5 min, and the upper soluble fraction was transferred to a new tube. The particulate fraction was resuspended in 250 μl Lysis buffer and homogenized by vigorous reciprocal shaking for 2 min. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, immobilized onto nitrocellulose filters by electroblotting, and immunoblotted using affinity purified anti-Inp51p antibodies according to standard protocols (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). pBluINP51 was digested with XbaI and PstI, releasing a 2610-bp partial INP51fragment encoding residues 163–946 that was gel-purified.INP51 residues 1–162 were made by PCR amplification of pBluINP51 template using sense and antisense primers, 5′-AGCTTGAGGATCCAAAATGAGACTCTTCATCGGTAGAAGA-3′ and 5′-AGTGCGTATCTAGAATAGTAGAATGTTCCATCACT-3′, under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The 516-bp product was digested withBamHI and XbaI, gel-purified, and co-inserted with the 2610-bp XbaI/PstI fragment into theBamHI and PstI sites of pCMV (31Wu Q. Sheehan J.P. Tsiang M. Lentz S.R. Birktoft J.J. Sadler J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6775-6779Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) to make pCMVINP51. The region generated by PCR was sequenced to confirm that no unwanted mutations were introduced. pCMVINP51 was digested with BamHI andPstI, and the 3.2-kb fragment containing the entireINP51 coding sequence was inserted into pTrcHisA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at these sites to yield pTrcINP51. Fifty-milliliter cultures of DH5α Escherichia coli strains (Life Technologies, Inc.) harboring either pTrc or pTrcINP51 plasmids were grown in LB broth to an A 600 of 0.6 and induced with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 14 h at 37 °C. Cells were pelleted, and lysates were prepared by addition of 1 ml Lysis buffer, 300 μl of glass beads, and vigorous reciprocal shaking as described above. Soluble and particulate fractions were prepared, separated by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted as described above. 5-Ptase activity was measured using either [3-H]PI(4,5)P2 or [3H]IP3 (NEN Life Science Products) substrates. Lipid substrate was made by brief sonication of 100 μg of phosphatidylinositol and 0.1 μCi of [3-H]PI(4,5)P2 in 250 μl of 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 5 mmMgCl2 and 50 mm KCl. Protein extracts were incubated with 5 μl of lipid vesicles in a final reaction volume of 25 μl at 37 °C for 2 h and stopped by addition of 25 μl of 1 n HCl. Lipids were extracted by adding 3.72 volumes chloroform/methanol (1:2 v/v), vortexing 30 s, adding 1.25 volume each of chloroform and 2 m KCl, vortexing 30 s, and centrifuging 2 min. Lipids were separated by oxalate/TLC, deacylated, and analyzed by HPLC as described below. Alternatively, IP35-ptase assays were performed by incubation of protein extracts with 10 μm [3H]IP3 in 50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm MgCl2 and 50 mm KCl and a reaction volume of 25 μl at 37 °C for appropriate times. Reactions were stopped by adding 475 μl of 350 mm ammonium formate containing 50 mm formic acid (AMF) and applied to 200 μl of Dowex/formate resin (AG1-X8, 200–400 mesh form, Bio-Rad). Products were eluted with 5 ml of AMF, and radioactivity was measured by adding 15 ml of scintillation fluid (ScintiSafeTM, Fisher) and counting. Approximately 1 × 105 cells were inoculated into 1 ml of appropriately modified CM containing 10–20 μCi of [3H]myoinositol (American Radiolabel Corp., St. Louis, MO) or YPD containing 50 μCi/ml [3H]myoinositol, grown to a density of 3 × 107 cells/ml, harvested by centrifugation, washed twice with 1 ml of ice-cold water, and resuspended in 100 μl of 0.5 n HCl. Extraction of soluble and lipid inositol phosphates was performed by adding 372 μl of chloroform/methanol (1:2 v/v) and 100 μl of glass beads, bead beating for 2 min, adding 125 μl each of chloroform and 2 m KCl, bead beating again for 2 min, and centrifuging at 20,800 ×g for 5 min. The upper and lower phases containing water-soluble and lipid inositol phosphates, respectively, were separated and stored at −80 °C no longer than 3 days prior to use. Silica-60 TLC plates (20 × 20 cm, Merck) were prepared by submersion in 54 mm potassium oxalate containing 47.5% ethanol, 2 mm EDTA and baked a minimum of 60 min at 100 °C prior to use. TLC plates were developed in a solvent mixture of 160 ml of chloroform, 60 ml of acetone, 52 ml of methanol, 48 ml of glacial acetic acid, and 28 ml of water. Radiolabeled lipids were detected by autoradiography after spraying plates with En[3H]ance (DuPont) and quantified by scraping appropriate regions of silica into 10 ml of scintillation fluid and counting after equilibration for 10 h. Alternatively, crude or TLC-separated radiolabeled lipids were subjected to deacylation (32Clarke N.G. Dawson R.M.C. Biochem. J. 1981; 195: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar), and resulting glycerophosphoinositols (groPI) were analyzed by HPLC. Crude radiolabeled lipids were dried by vacuum centrifugation and incubated with 300 μl of methylamine reagent (prepared by bubbling gaseous methylamine (CH3NH2, Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) into ice-cold 6.2 ml of methanol, 4.6 ml of H2O, and 1.5 ml of 1-butanol until the total volume reached 20 ml) at 53 °C for 30 min and vortexing every 10 min. Cold 1-propanol (150 μl) was added, and the mixture was vacuum centrifuged to dryness. The residue was resuspended in 200 μl of H2O, extracted twice with 300 μl of 1-butanol/petroleum ether/ethyl formate (20:4:1 v/v/v), each time discarding the upper layer, and stored at −80 °C until use. Deacylation of TLC-separated lipids was performed by scraping appropriate regions of silica into a screw cap Eppendorf tube, pulverizing with a glass rod, and incubating with methylamine reagent as above. In some cases, [32P]PI(3)P and [32P]PI(3,4)P2 (obtained from Andy Norris, Washington University) were included, thereby generating “internal” groPI(3)P and groPI(3,4)P2 standards. GroPIs were resolved either by Partisphere or Partisil SAX HPLC. Samples were equilibrated in 10 mm ammonium phosphate, pH 3.5 (AP), applied to a Partisphere SAX column (4.6 × 250 mm, Whatman), and eluted using a linear gradient of 10 mm AP to 340 mm AP over 30 min; 340 mm AP to 1.02m AP over 15 min; and constant 1.02 m AP 5 min (gradient 1). Radioactivity of eluant was measured using a BetaRAMTM in-line detector (INUS, Tampa, FL). GroPI standards were made by deacylation of TLC-purified [3H]PI, -PI(3)P, -PI(4)P, and -PI(4,5)P2. Alternatively, samples were equilibrated in 40 mm ammonium formate, pH 3.5 (AF), applied to a Partisil SAX (4.6 × 250 mm, Whatman) column, and eluted using the following gradients: 40 to 400 mm AF over 30 min, 800 mm to 1.3 mAF over 33 min, 1.7 to 1.85 m AF over 10 min, 1.85 to 3m AF over 47 min (“gradient 3” as described in Ref.33Cunningham T.W.

Fractions (1 ml) were collected and mixed with 10 ml of scintillation fluid (ScintiSafeTM, Fisher), and both3H and 32P radioactivity was determined by counting. Samples of soluble inositol phosphates included internal standards of [32P]Ins(1,4)P2 and [32P]IP3 (provided by Cecil Buchanan, Washington University). It is noteworthy that using this system, slight decreases in resolution and elution times were noticed after repeated column use. Approximately 10,000 cpm of TLC-purified [3H]PI(4,5)P2 derived from radiolabeled inp51 mutant cells was combined with 100 μg of PI, [32P]PI(3)P, and [32P]PI(3,4)P2 standards and dried under a steady N2 stream, and the residue was sonicated briefly in 100 μl of 50 mm MES/Tris, pH 6.5, containing 5 mm MgCl2. Lipid substrate was incubated with 100 ng of purified recombinant OCRL-1 5-ptase (obtained from Xiaoling Zhang, Washington University) for 30 min at 37 °C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 300 μl of methylamine reagent. The products were then deacylated and characterized by Partisil SAX HPLC as detailed above. pCMVINP51 was digested with BamHI and SacII, releasing a 3.2-kb fragment containing the complete coding sequence which was inserted into pBJ246 (ATCC 777452) at these sites to yield pBJ246INP51. pBJ246INP51 or pBJ246plasmids were transformed into the haploid W303 by the standard Li+ acetate protocol (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). Ura+ strains were grown in 1 ml of CM lacking uracil (CM/ura−) supplemented with 2% glucose to a density of 5 × 107 cells/ml, washed 3 times in 1 ml of CM/ura− without sugar, resuspended in 1 ml of CM/ura− supplemented with either 2% glucose (uninduced) or 2% galactose (induced), and grown for 9 h at 30 °C. Cellular extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by immunoblotting as described above. For inositol labeling studies the growth media were supplemented with 10 μCi/ml [3H]myoinositol, and radiolabeled lipids were analyzed by TLC as described above. The complete coding region ofPLC1 was replaced with the G418 gene using a PCR-based approach. G418 was amplified from plasmid pFA6-kanMX2 (34Wach A. Brachat A. Pohlmann R. Philippsen P. Yeast. 1994; 10: 1793-1808Crossref PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar) by PCR using the sense primer 5′-AAACGTACAACGGTAAGGTCATTCACGCAGTGTATATGCAGCTGAAGCTTCGTACGC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-CGTATTTATGAATATGTGTATTTGGCCGGAAAAAGATCGCCGCATAGGCCACTAGTGGATCTG-3′ (obtained from Joseph Heitman, Duke University) (where underlined bases correspond to PLC1 sequence and the remainder of the primer is from the pFA6-kanMX2 plasmid) according to conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The resultingplc1::G418 PCR product was introduced into diploid cells by the standard Li+ acetate protocol (28Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1995Google Scholar). Stable G418R cells were selected for on YPD plates supplemented with 200 μg/ml G418 (Calbiochem) and verified by PCR of genomic DNA template using the above sense primer and an antisense primer 5′-ATATACTCGAGAACTTTCTGCTGAAGAGAAGGC-3′ (obtained from Joseph Heitman) derived from the 3′-untranslated region of the PLC1locus. The TBLASTN search algorithm (35Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (71458) Google Scholar) was used to compare the amino acid sequences of the mammalian 5-ptases, type I, type II, and OCRL-1 (GenBankTM accession numbers Z31695, M74161, andM88162, respectively) to the predicted open reading frames in S. cerevisiae genomic sequence (available January, 1995). We identified a highly related open reading frame corresponding to locus YIL002c, located on chromosome IX, encoding a 946-residue gene product, designated here as INP51 for INositol polyphosphate 5-Phosphatase number1. The carboxyl-terminal region of Inp51p is approximately 30% identical (>50% similar) over 300 amino acids to the catalytic domains of type II and OCRL-1 5-ptases. Importantly, Inp51p contains the two short sequence motifs common to all 5-ptases characterized to date (Fig. 1 A). Two substitutions of the “PAWCDRILW” sequence of type II and OCRL-1 are found in Inp51p, Cys787 → Thr and Trp792 → Ser. In addition, the amino-terminal half of Inp51p has significant similarity to the S. cerevisiae 623-residue SAC1and the predicted 879-residue YNL325c gene products (Fig.1 A). Although SAC1 is not an essential gene,sac1Δ mutants are inositol auxotrophs and are cold-sensitive; moreover, particular sac1 alleles suppress certain act1 ts alleles (36Novick P. Osmond B.C. Botstein D. Genetics. 1989; 121: 659-674Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and asac1Δ mutation bypasses the effects of thesec14–1 ts mutation (37Cleves A.E. Novick P.J. Bankaitis V.A. J.

In the present study, we have cloned a cDNA encoding a P2X1 purinoceptor from human platelets using degenerate reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction. Northern blotting with a P2X1-specific probe revealed a band of 1.8 kilobases in human platelets as well as in several megakaryoblastic cell lines. 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells expressing the cloned P2X1 cDNA exhibited both ATP- and ADP-stimulated Ca2+ influx that could be blocked by the purinoceptor antagonist pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid and suramin. Additionally, a polyclonal antibody raised against glutathione-S-transferase-P2X1 fusion peptide reacted with a 70-kDa band on Western blot of human platelets.

It is therefore concluded that functional P2X1 purinoceptors are present in human platelets. Platelet activation is known to be involved in the development of atherosclerosis and restenosis after angioplasty. ADP is an important endogenous platelet agonist. Stimulation of platelets with ADP has been shown to mediate platelet shape change, aggregation, and further release of ADP and ATP from activated platelets. The ADP receptor in platelets is reported to possess a unique, pharmacologically characteristic P2T-type purinoceptor (1Hourani S.M.O. Hall D.A. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1994; 15: 103-108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Activation of the ADP receptor causes immediate activation of a non-selective cation channel that mediates calcium influx and mobilization of calcium from intracellular stores (2Sage S.O. Rink T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16364-16369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Mahaut-Smith M.P. Sage S.O. Rink T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3060-3065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membrane binding experiments have indicated the presence of both high and low affinity binding sites for ADP in platelets (4Greco N.J. Tandon N.N. Jackson B.W. Jamieson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2966-2970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Savi P. Laplace M.C.L. Herbert J.M. Thromb. Res. 1994; 76: 157-169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Furthermore, pharmacological and clinical studies have also suggested the presence of two types of ADP receptors (6Gachet C. Cattaneo M. Ohlmann P. Lecchi A. Hechler B. Chevalier J. Cassel D.

Blood. 1992; 80: 2787-2796Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Several platelet membrane ADP-binding proteins have been proposed as putative ADP receptor (8Cristalli G. Mills D.C Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 875-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 9Adler J.R. Handin R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3866-3872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Figures W.R. Niewiarowski S. Morinelli T.A. Colman R.F. Colman R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7789-7795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but no peptide sequence is available for the cloning purposes. Recently, it has been shown by patch clamp techniques and intracellular calcium measurements that both ADP and ATP can activate a channel and mediate an increase in intracellular calcium concentration in human platelets. It has also been suggested that the ADP/ATP-gated non-selective cation channel resembles a P2X1 purinoceptor (11MacKenzie A.B. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2879-2881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Extracellular ATP and ADP interact with two subgroups of P2 purinoceptors, P2X and P2Y (12Surprenant A. Buell G. North R.A. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 224-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 13Burnstock G. King B.F. Drug Dev. Res. 1996; 38: 67-71Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning has identified seven members of P2X, a non-selective cation channel with two transmembrane domains; P2Y, which belongs to the seven-transmembrane domain G-protein-coupled receptor family, consists of more than seven members identified to date. Based on the effects of ADP on adenylyl cyclase, activation of phospholipase C, and intracellular calcium mobilization, we hypothesize that the P2T receptor in human platelets may consist of one P2X-like and one or more P2Y-like separate components. This hypothesis is also supported by recent demonstration of a P2Y1-type purinoceptor in human platelets (14Leon C. Hechler B. Vial C. Cazenave J.P. Gachet C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 403: 26-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). In the present study, P2X1 cDNA was cloned from human platelets, and its function was further characterized after heterologous expression in mammalian cells. ATP, ADP, α,β-methylene-ATP, aspirin, and apyrase were purchased from Sigma. ATP and ADP were further purified by high performance liquid chromatography using a Partisil Sax 10 μm, 250 × 4.6-mm column and a gradual elution with 50–750 mm ammonium phosphate buffer, pH 3.5. Fura-2 acetoxymethyl ester was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid (PPADS) 1The abbreviations used are: PPADS, pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2′,4′-disulfonic acid; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GST, glutathione-S-transferase; FSBA, 5'-p-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine; kb, kilobase(s); RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends. was from Calbiochem; and suramin was from RBI (Natick, MA). HEPES-Tyrode buffer for calcium measurement contained 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, and 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4. In the case of calcium-free solution, CaCl2 was replaced with 1 mm EGTA. Blood was drawn from healthy volunteers and mixed with 0.1 volume of 3.8% sodium citrate followed by centrifugation at 150 × g for 20 min. Supernatant (platelet-rich plasma) was collected without disturbing buffy coat and packed red blood cells. Aspirin (1 mm) and apyrase (20 μg/ml, final concentration) were then added to prevent platelet activation by spontaneously released thromboxane and ADP, respectively (3Mahaut-Smith M.P. Sage S.O. Rink T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3060-3065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Contaminating leukocytes and red blood cells were removed by an additional centrifugation for 10 min at 150 × g. The pH of resultant platelet-rich plasma was lowered to 6.5 with citric acid (4 μl/ml from 1 m stock) before sedimentation of platelets at 800 × g for 15 min (4Greco N.J. Tandon N.N. Jackson B.W. Jamieson G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 2966-2970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pellet was lysed, and RNA was extracted with RNA STAT-60 (TEL-TEST B, Inc.). Possible contamination of platelet RNA specimens with leukocyte RNA was ruled out by reverse transcription-PCR amplification (negative) of β2 integrin, which presents in leukocytes but not in platelets, using two specific primers. First strand complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized utilizing a random hexamer primer using SuperscriptTM (Life Technologies, Inc.). Degenerate primers for P2X were designed and synthesized based on the conserved regions of rat P2X1, P2X2, and P2X3. The sequence for 5′ primer used was 5′-TTCACCMTYYTCATCAARAACAGCATC-3′, and the 3′ primer was 5′-ATRGTRGGRATGAKRYYRAAYTTSCC-3′ (M = A and C, Y = C and T, R = A and G, K = T and G, S = C and G). cDNA was then amplified by PCR using a Perkin-Elmer thermocycler 480. Cloned cDNA fragments in pCR2.1 plasmid (Invitrogen) were sequenced manually using Sequenase V2.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or automatically using an ABI Prism 377 DNA sequencer. To obtain the full-length cDNA, rapid amplification of 5′ cDNA ends (5′-RACE) and 3′-RACE (Life Technologies) were used to amplify 5′ and 3′ termini of the P2X1 cDNA, respectively. The full-length P2X1coding region was amplified from human platelets and cloned into a mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). The expression was driven by a cytomegalovirus early promoter. Transfection into 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells (a kind gift from Dr. Toews, Nebraska University Medical Center) that are deficient in purinergic receptors (15Filtz T.M. Li Q. Boyer J.L. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 8-14PubMed Google Scholar) was carried out using calcium phosphate precipitation. Stable transfectants were selected using G418 at the concentration of 500 μg/ml for 12 days. 1321N1 astrocytoma cells grown on glass coverslips were loaded with Fura-2-acetoxymethyl ester (1 μm) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing with HEPES-Tyrode buffer, changes in Fura-2 fluorescence were measured in a SPEX spectrofluorometer (Floromax-2). [Ca2+]i was calculated from the 340/380 ratio as described by Grynkiewicz et al. (16Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). a cDNA fragment containing the 5′-terminal 958-base pair coding region of P2X1 cDNA from human platelets was labeled with 32P by nick translation and used as probe. Total RNA was extracted from pooled, fresh human platelets, cultured Meg-01, K562, and CMK11–5 cells and run on a 1% denatured formaldehyde-agarose gel. After blotting and fixing on a nylon membrane, the membrane was incubated with the probe and allowed to hybridize at 42 °C overnight. The membrane was then washed three times with 1× SSC (150 mm NaCl and 15 mm sodium citrate) plus 0.1% SDS. Before exposing to x-ray film, the membrane was washed once with 0.2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS. The full-length P2X1 coding region from human platelets was recombined into plasmid vector pGEX-2T (Amersham) and overexpressed as a GST fusion protein. The GST-P2X1 fusion protein was purified from the cell lysates by affinity chromatography on glutathione-immobilized-Sepharose beads followed by elution with glutathione. The eluted fusion product was dialyzed three times against Tris-buffered saline (150 mmNaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4) and used to raise polyclonal antibodies in rabbits by Animal Pharm Services, Inc. (Healdsburg, CA). IgG was purified by affinity chromatography on Protein A-Sepharose. The specificity of the IgG was confirmed; the antibody recognized the Gst-P2X1 fusion protein but not GST alone. Human platelets and cultured cells were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (phosphate-buffered saline plus 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, and 0.5% digitonin) for 60 min on ice. After centrifugation at 5,000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge for 10 min, the supernatants were mixed with loading buffer and denatured for 5 min at 95 °C, and components were resolved on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophorsis. Resolved proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose using a Bio-Rad trans-blot electrophoretic system. After blocking nonspecific binding sites with nonfat dry milk (5% in phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.5% Tween 20) overnight, the membrane was probed with anti GST-P2X1 IgG (1:2,500) for 60 min at room temperature. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG was used as secondary antibody. Finally, the immunoreactive bands were visualized by ECL (Amersham). A single band of cDNA was amplified from human platelet RNA preparations as well as from three megakaryoblastic cell lines (Meg-01, K562, and CMK11–5) using degenerate primers for the P2X purinoceptor. Subsequent DNA sequencing confirmed that the sequence of this fragment was identical to a region of cloned human urinary bladder smooth muscle P2X1 receptor (17Valera S. Talabot F. Evans R. Gos A. Antonarakis S.E. Morris M.A. Buell G.N. Recept. Channels. 1995; 3: 283-289PubMed Google Scholar). To detect any less homologous subtypes, we have attempted to use very low annealing temperatures for the PCR amplification (down to 30 °C), but no additional homologous clones were obtained. To obtain the full-length platelet P2X1cDNA, 5′-RACE and 3′-RACE protocols were used to clone the 5′ and 3′ terminals of the cDNA, respectively. Several clones for the 5′-terminal and 3′-terminal regions of P2X1 in human platelets were amplified and subsequently cloned into pCR2.1 vectors. After complete two-directional DNA sequencing, it was found that the total length of cDNA for P2X1 in human platelets is 1861 base pairs. In comparison to the human urinary bladder P2X1 clone, the P2X1 cDNA in human platelets is 885 base pairs shorter at the 3′ terminus of the noncoding region. At the 5′ terminus there are 103 additional bases in the platelet cDNA. The sequence is 5′-AGGGGAATTTATTTGTCCATGGGCGAGGCTGGCCTGCAGTCTGTTGCCTTCCAGGGGCCAAGAGCTGCTCTGATCACCCAGGGATTCTCTCTCCAACCCAAGT-3′. The region from base 57 to 100 of the platelet cDNA shows a high homology (84%) to the rat P2X1 cDNA 5′ terminus (base 1–44). The difference between platelet and bladder smooth muscle at the 5′ terminus together with the truncated 3′ terminal suggests that the transcription of P2X1 in human megakaryocyte may be regulated by a different promoter or that post-transcriptionally it undergoes a different splicing process (see discussion). The coding region, however, is identical between the platelet and bladder smooth muscle P2X1 cDNA. Therefore, the P2X purinoceptor expressed in human platelets is the P2X1 subtype, a nonselective cation channel with 399 amino acids and two hydrophobic domains as predicted from the cDNA sequence. To characterize the function of the platelet P2X1 channel, we overexpressed the platelet P2X1 cDNA in 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells, which have been reported to be unresponsive to ATP or ADP (15Filtz T.M. Li Q. Boyer J.L. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 8-14PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular free calcium was measured to monitor the channel activity after stimulation. After selection with G418, 14 stably transfected cell lines were tested, and among those, two responded to ATP stimulation. All subsequent experiments were carried out with these two cell lines using nontransfected cells as the negative control. It was found that both ATP and ADP caused intracellular calcium to increase dose-dependently followed by a slightly elevated plateau (Fig. 1). In calcium-free buffers (in the presence of 1 mm EGTA) as shown in Fig. 1 e, no [Ca2+]iincrease was observed upon ATP or ADP addition, indicating that the calcium increase seen in the presence of extracellular calcium was solely due to extracellular calcium influx through the expressed P2X1 channel. Furthermore, ATP/ADP-induced [Ca2+]i increase was inhibited by the purinoceptor type 2-specific antagonists PPADS (100 μm, Fig. 1 d) and suramin (100 μm, data not shown). Desensitization of the channel was also observed. Applying either ATP or ADP (up to 100 μm) 3 min after the first dose (1 or 10 μm) caused little or no further [Ca2+]i elevation (data not shown). Similar results have been reported in human platelets by monitoring ATP-activated ion channel activity using patch clamp techniques (11MacKenzie A.B. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2879-2881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Even at low temperatures ATP slowly hydrolyzes to ADP. To accurately estimate the potency of different agonists of the platelet P2X1 channel, ATP and ADP were purified by ion exchange chromatography. It was found that ATP was contaminated with ADP by less than 1%. No difference was observed between purified and nonpurified ATP or ADP in calcium influx amplitude. As shown in Fig. 1, the order of potency in mediating the [Ca2+]i increase in the transfected cells was α,β-methylene-ATP > ATP > ADP. This order is different from that of human bladder smooth muscle (17Valera S. Talabot F. Evans R. Gos A. Antonarakis S.E. Morris M.A. Buell G.N. Recept. Channels. 1995; 3: 283-289PubMed Google Scholar) and that of rat vas deferens P2X1 purinoceptor overexpressed in oocytes (18Valera S. Hussy N. Evans R.J. Adami N. North R.A. Surprenant A. Buell G. Nature. 1994; 371: 516-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (900) Google Scholar), where α,β-methylene-ATP was slightly less potent than ATP. This discrepancy may be due to the different expression vehicles employed (mammalian cell versus Xenopusoocyte) and different detection systems (intracellular calciumversus ion current by patch clamp). However, the potency of α,β-methylene-ATP > ATP reported in the present study for platelet P2X1 channel correlates well with the higher potency of α,β-methylene-ATP in whole tissue studies (19Burnstock G. Kennedy C. Gen. Pharmacol. 1985; 16: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (1135) Google Scholar). The EC50 for ATP and ADP for the platelet P2X1channel was estimated to be 3.4 and 10.1 μm, respectively (Fig. 1 g). ATP and ADP reached equal potency at about 30 μm, probably as a result of fast desensitization induced by ATP. It was noticed that ADP-mediated [Ca2+]i increased with a slow onset at a concentration of 10 μm or below, as tested (Fig. 1,b and c). Previously, it has been reported that several different size bands for P2X1 purinoceptor were present in many tissues by Northern blotting, with a principal band at 2.6 kb. A 1.8-kb band was also detected in HL60 cells, human spleen, and lung (17Valera S. Talabot F. Evans R. Gos A. Antonarakis S.E. Morris M.A. Buell G.N. Recept. Channels. 1995; 3: 283-289PubMed Google Scholar). The expression of P2X1 purinoceptor in human platelets was confirmed in the present study by Northern blot analysis as well. A single 1.8-kb band was detected in an RNA extract from human platelets as well as in the RNA extracts from Meg-01, K562, and CMK11–5 cells (Fig.2). Using the same probe, several bands were detected in 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-treated HL60 cells with two major bands at 2.6 and 1.8 kb, similar to previous findings from another laboratory (17Valera S. Talabot F. Evans R. Gos A. Antonarakis S.E. Morris M.A. Buell G.N. Recept. Channels. 1995; 3: 283-289PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 2, lane 6). The short form (1.8 kb) in platelets may be due to a truncated, untranslated 3′ terminus, as confirmed by the cDNA sequence. The single short band pattern further suggests that the expression of P2X1purinoceptor in megakaryocytes and platelets is regulated by a different promotor or post-transcriptional processing. Polyclonal antibodies were raised against the human platelet P2X1 purinoceptor using purified GST-P2X1fusion protein overexpressed in Escherichia coli. Anti P2X1 antibody recognized a single band of 70 kDa on Western blots of P2X1-transfected 1321N1 astrocytoma cells but not of nontransfected control cells (Fig. 3). A corresponding band was also recognized in human platelets. In addition, two other large faint bands (∼95 and 120 kDa) were also detected in human platelets after longer exposure, which remains unexplained at the moment. It may be due to nonspecific binding of the polyclonal antibody. Subsequent immunoprecipitation assay would help to rule out this possibility. On the basis of obtained cDNA sequence, a 45-kDa peptide was predicted for human P2X1 purinoceptor. The high molecular mass of the band detected in human platelets indicates possibly a significant glycosylation of the receptor in the extracellular domain. This size is different from the previously reported ADP-binding proteins in human platelets using photo-affinity labeling (43 kDa) (8Cristalli G. Mills D.C Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 875-881Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), solubilization (61 kDa) (9Adler J.R. Handin R.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 3866-3872Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or covalent labeling with FSBA (100 kDa) (10Figures W.R. Niewiarowski S. Morinelli T.A. Colman R.F. Colman R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 7789-7795Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The number of ADP-activated channels was estimated in the range of 13–130/platelet (3Mahaut-Smith M.P. Sage S.O. Rink T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3060-3065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11MacKenzie A.B. Mahaut-Smith M.P. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2879-2881Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that P2X1may be involved in ADP-induced platelet shape change (20Gachet C. Hechler B. Leon C. Vial C. Leray C. Ohlmann P. Cazenave J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). However, αβ-methylene-ATP, which is a selective agonist for P2X1purinoceptor and is independent of phospholipase C activation (12Surprenant A. Buell G. North R.A. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 224-229Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), did not induce any platelet shape change (6Gachet C. Cattaneo M. Ohlmann P. Lecchi A. Hechler B.

Li, unpublished observations. and in Meg-01 cells (22Hechler B. Cazenave J.P. Hanau D. Gachet C. Nouv. Rev. Fr. Hematol. 1995; 37: 231-240PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of P2Y7 was found in another megakaryoblastic cell line HEL (20Gachet C. Hechler B. Leon C. Vial C. Leray C. Ohlmann P. Cazenave J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 78: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). It is now established that all P2Y purinoceptors cloned so far are coupled to G-proteins, which mediate phospholipase C activation/adenylyl cyclase activity change (13Burnstock G. King B.F. Drug Dev. Res. 1996; 38: 67-71Crossref Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In human platelets, there are at least five isoforms of phospholipase C; they are involved in G-protein-coupled or tyrosine kinase-linked signal transduction to generate inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (23Nozawa Y. Banno Y. Nagata K. Authi K.S. Watson S.P. Kakkar V.V. Mechanism of Platelet Activation and Control. Plenum Publishing Corp., New York1993: 37-47Google Scholar). All isoforms of phospholipase C contain a C2 domain that requires calcium for its function; all phospholipase Cs are activated by calciumin vitro (24Rhee S.G. Bae Y.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15045-15048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (815) Google Scholar). Watson et al. (25Watson S.P. Poole A. Asselin J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 47: 823-830PubMed Google Scholar) have reported that the elevation of intracellular calcium regulates agonist-induced activation of phospholipase C in human platelets. ADP has been shown to raise the intracellular concentration of calcium in platelets by two sequential mechanisms, the opening of nonselective cation channels (P2X1) in 20 ms to allow calcium influx followed by mobilization of calcium from the intracellular stores with a delay of 200 ms through the activation of G-protein-coupled receptor (2Sage S.O. Rink T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 16364-16369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Mahaut-Smith M.P. Sage S.O. Rink T.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3060-3065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although the initial small calcium elevation alone is not able to mediate any detectable physiological effects, the increased intracellular calcium concentration may prime or enhance the activation of some components in the signal transduction cascade, such as phospholipase C, for subsequent receptor-mediated signal transduction. In summary, we have presented data showing that a P2X1purinoceptor, a ligand-gated cation channel, is present in human platelets. It has an apparent molecular mass of 70 kDa as judged by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophorsis. Activation of this channel by ATP and ADP results in calcium influx. The physiological function of P2X1 channel in human platelets remains to be established. We would like to thank Dr. N. N. Tandon and S. Lockyer for their suggestions and comments. We thank N. Banerjee and M. Guertin for the purification of ATP and ADP."

For lysosomal proteases proteolytic cleavage of the propeptide is triggered by the acidic pH. By using fluorescence, circular dichroism, and NMR spectroscopy, we show that upon decreasing the pH from 6.5 to 3 the propeptide of cathepsin L loses most of the tertiary structure, but almost none of the secondary structure is lost. Another partially structured intermediate, prone to aggregation, was identified between pH 6.5 and 4. The conformation, populated below pH 4, where the activation of cathepsin L occurs, is not completely unfolded and has the properties of molten globule, including characteristic binding of the 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid. This pH unfolding of the propeptide parallels a decrease of its affinity for cathepsin L and suggests the mechanism for the acidic zymogen activation. Addition of anionic polysaccharides that activate cathepsin L already at pH 5.5 unfolds the tertiary structure of the propeptide at this pH. Propeptide of human cathepsin L which is able to fold independently represents an evolutionary intermediate in the emergence of novel inhibitors originating from the enzyme proregions.

Propeptide of human cathepsin L which is able to fold independently represents an evolutionary intermediate in the emergence of novel inhibitors originating from the enzyme proregions. All lysosomal and most other proteases are synthesized in the form of inactive precursors (1Erickson A.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 40: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 2Neurath H. Trends. Biochem. Sci. 1989; 14: 268-271Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Propeptides are generally located N-terminal to the mature enzyme, and activation of the enzyme is accomplished by cis- or trans-cleavage of the propeptide. Propeptides vary from a few (e.g. trypsin) to more than 200 residues (e.g. cathepsin C). Longer propeptides are generally strong and specific inhibitors of their mature enzymes (3Fox T. de Miguel E. Mort J.S. Storer A.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 12571-12576Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 4Fusek M. Mares M. Vagner J. Voburka Z. Baudys M.

Proteins. 1992; 12: 339-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In most cases propeptides are also indispensable for correct folding of the enzymes (8Anfinsen C.B. Science. 1973; 181: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (5135) Google Scholar). In some enzymes folding of the mature form is extremely slow, and the propeptide assists in overcoming the kinetic barrier (9Baker D. Sohl J.L. Agard D.A. Nature. 1992; 356: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), which may also be overcome by physicochemical factors such as high ionic strength in subtilisin, for example (10Bryan P. Alexander P. Strausberg S. Schwarz F. Lan W. Gilliland G. Gallagher D.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4937-4945Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Proenzymes are quite often more stable than mature enzymes (11Mason R.W. Gal S. Gottesman M.M. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 12Mach L. Mort J.S. Glossl J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13036-13040Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and can represent a pool of latent enzyme until the activation occurs in the proper conditions. Propeptides are also involved in targeting to specific organelles (13Chapman R.L. Kane S.E. Erickson A.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8808-8816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 14Takeshima H. Sakaguchi M. Mihara K. Murakami K. Omura T. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1995; 118: 981-988Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar); they can affect posttranslational modification such as glycosylation (15Vernet T. Tessier D.C. Richardson C. Laliberte F. Khouri H.E. Bell A.W. Storer A.C. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16661-16666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mediate interactions with other molecules (16McIntyre G.F. Erickson A.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10588-10592Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 17Lazzarino D. Gabel C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11864-11871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Propeptides can be cleaved either by other proteases or by intra- or intermolecular autocatalysis. pH change is one of the most common environmental parameters responsible for triggering the activation of proteases, occurring in cysteine, aspartic acid, and metalloproteases (1Erickson A.H. J. Cell. Biochem. 1989; 40: 31-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 18Anderson E.D. VanSlyke J.K. Thulin C.D. Jean F. Thomas G. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1508-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar, 19Takeda-Ezaki E.M.M. Yamamoto K. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 304: 352-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Low pH is thought either to increase the susceptibility of the propeptide as a substrate due to the protonation of groups close to the cleavage site or to cause a conformational change in the propeptide or enzyme. Cathepsin L is one of the most active cysteine proteases and accounts for most of the lysosomal cysteine protease activity (20Kominami E. Ueno T. Muno D. Katunuma N. FEBS Lett. 1991; 287: 189-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It has been implicated in a range of processes including turnover of proteins involved in growth regulation, tumor invasion and metastasis (21Kane S.E. Gottesman M.M. Semin. Cancer Biol. 1990; 1: 127-136PubMed Google Scholar), and bone resorption (22Kakegawa H. Tagami K. Ohba Y. Sumitani K. Kawata T. Katunuma N. FEBS Lett. 1995; 370: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The mouse analogue of procathepsin is secreted from transformed mouse fibroblasts and has been at first called major excreted protein (11Mason R.W. Gal S. Gottesman M.M. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Procathepsin L is stable under neutral and slightly alkaline pH conditions where mature cathepsin L is rapidly inactivated (11Mason R.W. Gal S. Gottesman M.M. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The proregion of cathepsin L is compulsory for its correct folding either in vivo (23Tao K. Stearns N.A. Dong J. Wu Q.L. Sahagian G.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) or in vitro(24Smith S.M. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 20487-20495Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Activation of cathepsin L occurs autocatalytically below pH 4 (11Mason R.W. Gal S. Gottesman M.M. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 25Dolinar M. Maganja D.B. Turk V. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1995; 376: 385-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and also at higher pH (around pH 5.5) in the presence of anionic oligosaccharides such as dextran sulfate or heparin (26Mason R.W. Massey S.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 189: 1659-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 27Ishidoh K. Kominami E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 352: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This mode of activation is very similar to that of other cysteine proteases of the papain family (28Mach L. Mort J.S. Glossl J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13030-13035Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Vernet T. Khouri H.E. Laflamme P. Tessier D.C. Musil R. Gour-Salin B.J. Storer A.C. Thomas D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21451-21457Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The crystal structure of the procathepsin L (30Coulombe R. Grochulski P. Sivaraman J. Menard R. Mort J.S. Cygler M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5492-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) shows that the proregion consists of a compact domain composed of three α-helices and a short stretch of β-strand up to the first 75 residues followed by a less ordered, extended chain of the remaining 20 residues. This domain lies above the active site cleft and inhibits the activity by sterically preventing the access to the active site. The structure of the proregion in procaricain is very similar (31Groves M.R. Taylor M.A. Scott M. Cummings N.J. Pickersgill R.W. Jenkins J.A. Structure. 1996; 4: 1193-1203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), whereas in procathepsin B it lacks the first helix (32Podobnik M. Kuhelj R. Turk V. Turk D. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 271: 774-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 33Cygler M. Sivaraman J. Grochulski P. Coulombe R. Storer A.C. Mort J.S. Structure. 1996; 4: 405-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). The helical domain of the proregion has a hydrophobic core containing three of the four tryptophans, which provide a convenient spectroscopic probe for investigating its conformation. The complete propeptide as well as its fragments, which comprise the compact domain, are potent inhibitors of cathepsin L (34Carmona E. Dufour E. Plouffe C. Takebe S. Mason P. Mort J.S. Menard R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8149-8157Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). This inhibition is strongly pH-dependent and drops sharply at the acidic pH. The main contribution of this decrease is due to a decrease in the rate of formation of the propeptide-enzyme complex (34Carmona E. Dufour E. Plouffe C. Takebe S. Mason P. Mort J.S. Menard R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8149-8157Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). However the mechanism of pH-dependent decrease in the K i and resulting cathepsin L activation is unknown. In the present study we were interested in the connection between the conformation of the propeptide and the process of acid-induced zymogen activation. Recombinant propeptide of cathepsin L in Escherichia coli has been prepared. We have applied fluorescence, circular dichroism, and nuclear magnetic resonance to investigate the structure of the free propeptide in solution. We show that the propeptide folds into a defined tertiary structure at neutral pH, which has not yet been observed for any propeptide of the lysosomal proteases. Moreover we have found a distinct conformational change upon decreasing the pH. Below pH 3.5, the pH of activation of the procathepsin L, the propeptide adopts a molten globule conformation, which can explain a decrease in the inhibitory constant and particularly the association rate and provide a mechanism for the activation. Restriction enzymes and Vent DNA polymerase were purchased from New England Biolabs, and the DNA sequencing kit was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Oligonucleotides were custom-synthesized by The Great American Gene Co. (Ramona, CA). The region coding for the propeptide for human cathepsin L (PRL) 1The abbreviations used are: PRL, propeptide of cathepsin L; ANS, 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid. was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotides 5′-GCGCATATGACTCTAACATTTGATCAC-3′ and 5′-CGCGGATCCTACTCATAAA ACAGAGGTTC-3′. Gene coding for the human preprocathepsin L was used as a template. Additional methionine was added at the N terminus. For the shortened propeptide PRL78, comprising 78 residues N-terminal of the propeptide and including additional methionine, oligonucleotide 5′- ATCGGGATCCTAGCCATTCATCACCTGCCTGA-3′ was used instead of the 3′ primer. Polymerase chain reaction products were subcloned into the pET3a expression vector (Novagen). Recombinant proteins were expressed inE. coli using intracellular expression under T7 RNA polymerase promoter inducible by 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside.15N-Labeled proteins were prepared by growing bacteria in the M9 minimal medium supplemented with 1 g/liter 15N NH4Cl (Isotec). Full-length propeptide and propeptide-(1–78) of cathepsin L were produced at yields of approximately 20 and 7 mg/liter bacterial culture. Both proteins were produced in form of inclusion bodies, which were isolated by sonication of the bacterial paste, suspended in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.1% Triton X-100, and centrifuged. The resulting compact pellet was extensively washed in the same buffer and finally in the buffer containing 1 m urea. Recombinant proteins were purified on a gel filtration column under denaturing conditions (8 m urea, 50 mm acetate, pH 3.3). For the PRL refolding was performed by gel filtration thereby transferring the protein from the denaturing buffer into 1m urea, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0. The protein was further purified on the Q-Sepharose column in the presence of 1m urea. Refolding of the PRL78 was performed by dilution into 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, dialyzed, and further purified using Q-Sepharose column in the same buffer. For spectroscopic experiments propeptides were dialyzed against the water and adjusted to pH 8. Any precipitate was removed by filtration, and corresponding buffer was added for each pH value. A Perkin-Elmer model LS-50 luminescence spectrometer was used for fluorescence measurements. Tryptophan emission of PRL was measured using an excitation wavelength of 290 nm. Three scans from 300 to 410 nm were recorded at a speed rate of 180 nm per min. PRL concentration was 0.02 mg/ml. ANS fluorescence was excited at 370 nm, and the emission spectra were measured from 400 to 610 nm. Two scans at scan rate of 220 nm per min were averaged. 10 μl of ANS (4 × 10−3m) was added to 620 μl of the same PRL solutions as for the tryptophan emission, giving a molar ratio of ANS to protein of 35. Buffers for pH measurements were 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.6 to 6, 15 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.7 to 3.8, and 15 mm glycine buffer, pH 3.5 to 2.2. pH 2 and lower was achieved by the addition of HCl to the protein in water. CD spectra were measured on an Aviv model 62A DS CD spectrometer, equipped with a thermostated cell holder. All measurements were performed at 18 °C to avoid thermal denaturation and to make less mobile any structure present. Near and far UV CD spectra were measured in cells with a path length of 10 and 1 mm, respectively. Base-line spectra were subtracted from each spectrum. Concentration of the proteins was determined from the absorbance at 280 nm taking into account the extinction coefficients calculated from the amino acid composition (2.27 for 1‰ PRL and 2.4 for PRL78). Typical concentrations of the propeptides were 20 and 5 μm for the near and far UV CD spectra, respectively. Results were converted into mean residue ellipticities in the far UV region (250–190 nm) and into molar ellipticities in the near UV region (340–250 nm). Stopped-flow experiments were performed on an SX-17MV Applied Photophysics stopped-flow spectrofluorimeter. A protein sample at a concentration of 200 μg/ml at pH 7.2 was mixed in a stopped-flow chamber with a 50 mmglycine HCl buffer at pH 3.5. As a control the propeptide was mixed with 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer at pH 7.2. Experiments were performed at 18 °C. NMR spectra were measured on an INOVA 600 Varian NMR spectrometer equipped with a triple resonance probe and z gradients. Concentration of PRL78 was around 0.5 mm in 20 mm buffers. Two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy spectra were measured on proteins dissolved in D2O at pH 7.0, without the pH adjustment due to the solvent. Spectral width was 12 ppm with 256 increments in indirect dimension and 2048 points in direct dimension. Free induction decays were apodized with a sine square function.1H-15N HSQC spectra were measured with spectral widths of 1700 and 3500 Hz for the 15N and 1H dimensions, respectively. Protein samples were dissolved in 90% H2O, 10% D2O. Quadrature detection was achieved with States-time proportional phase increment method. Pulsed field gradients were used to suppress water signal, which was further decreased by time domain spectral deconvolution. Data were transformed using FELIX software (MSI) on a Silicon Graphics workstation. The fluorescence emission spectrum of the recombinant propeptide of human cathepsin L (PRL) at neutral pH has a maximum at 335 nm, showing that tryptophan residues are predominantly in a hydrophobic environment shielded from the solvent. The near UV CD spectrum exhibits fine structure characteristic of a folded protein (Fig. 1) with high positive ellipticity centered at 280 nm with a shoulder at 288 nm and a trough at 294 nm. This indicates rigid asymmetric environments of the aromatic residues, of which four are tryptophans. The near UV CD spectrum does not change significantly between pH 8 and 6.5. Far UV CD spectra indicate that the free propeptide contains a high content of α-helix (44%, predicted from the neural network program k2d (35Andrade M.A. Chacon P. Merelo J.J. Moran F. Protein Eng. 1993; 6: 383-390Crossref PubMed Scopus (949) Google Scholar)), consistent with the crystal structure of the propeptide in procathepsin L. By using ellipticity at 220 nm as a probe the propeptide undergoes a cooperative and reversible transition upon heating with a midpoint at 45 °C (not shown), as expected for a protein with a defined tertiary structure. Full-length propeptide aggregates at concentrations above 0.5 mg/ml, so we have also produced fragment 1–78 of the PRL (PRL78). This fragment comprises the compact domain of the proregion and contains all four tryptophan residues. It has a lower tendency to aggregate compared with the full-length propeptide, being particularly suited for the NMR experiments. Fluorescence emission maximum of the PRL78 is at 336 nm, and near and far UV CD spectra are closely similar to the spectra of PRL (not shown), implying that the region with defined tertiary structure (or at least core with aromatic residues) is limited to this region. Two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy spectrum of the PRL78 at pH 7.0 displays many nuclear Overhauser effects between the aromatic and aliphatic side chain protons (Fig. 2), as additional evidence for the tertiary structure interactions.Figure 2Two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy spectrum of PRL78 in the native state, pH 7.0.Concentration of the protein was 0.2 mm. The number of transients was 128; temperature was 18 °C; and mixing time was 150 ms.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Ellipticity in the near UV CD spectra decreases with decreasing pH (Fig. 1) indicating unfolding of tertiary structure upon acidification. Fluorescence emission intensity decreases likewise with a midpoint of transition around pH 5.5 (Fig.3). Wavelength maximum of the fluorescence decreases from 335 nm at pH 8 (state N) to 342 nm at pH 5.4 and persists at 346 nm in the pH range 4.8 to 3.6 (state X). Further lowering the pH causes an additional increase in the wavelength maximum, reaching the λmax of 353 nm below pH 3, characteristic for the solvent-exposed tryptophan residues. Far UV CD spectra remain quite similar upon decrease of pH with only a small difference in shape at pH below 4 (Fig.4). This indicates that the secondary structure content of the propeptide is conserved. The acidic state (state A) is thus characterized by a high content of the secondary structure and the absence of the aromatic core and persistent tertiary structure. Presence of the secondary and absence of persistent tertiary structure are two of the characteristics of molten globule type conformations (36Christensen H. Pain R.H. Eur. Biophys. J. 1991; 19: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The ANS binding to propeptide, as monitored by fluorescence emission at 478 nm, is low at neutral pH values and increases in the pH range from 3.5 to 1.5 (Fig.5), where there is almost no tertiary structure left but still high amounts of secondary structure, again confirming the presence of molten globule type conformation. At even lower pH the propeptide transforms into an unfolded state which does not bind ANS, as shown also for other proteins (37Semisotnov G.V. Rodionova N.A. Razgulyaev O.I. Uversky V.N. Gripas' A.F. Gilmanshin R.I. Biopolymers. 1991; 31: 119-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (1231) Google Scholar). Higher ionic strength shifts the transition toward higher pH values and increases the aggregation of the X state (not shown). The ANS molecules were efficiently excited by the process of energy transfer from tryptophans, when we used excitation wavelength of 293 nm. This shows a close proximity of the hydrophobic, ANS binding surfaces to tryptophans. Unfolding of the truncated propeptide PRL78, monitored by near and far UV CD, followed very closely unfolding of the full-length propeptide. PRL78 was used for the two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC NMR experiments due to its higher solubility. At pH 3.3, when the protein is in the A state, dispersion of the amide cross-peaks in the H-N plane is typical for a partially structured conformation, whereas in the unfolded state, in the presence of 8 m urea (U state), dispersion is much decreased (Fig.6), proving that the A state is not completely unfolded. Stopped-flow fluorescence experiments were performed by transferring the PRL78 from pH 7.2 to 3.5 in order to evaluate the rate of acidic unfolding. Fluorescence decrease occurred within the mixing time of the device (Fig.7), indicating a rate of unfolding faster than 100 s−1.Figure 4Far UV CD spectra of PRL at different pH values.

Propeptide in the 5 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, was rapidly mixed with the 50 mm buffer at the pH 3.5 (•) and 7.2 (○) in the mixing chamber of the Applied Photophysics stopped-flow spectrofluorimeter.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Addition of dextran sulfate to PRL78 at pH 5.5 causes a complete elimination of the near UV CD ellipticity, showing that the tertiary structure is destroyed (Fig.8). Ellipticity in the far UV is also much decreased at this pH, different from the propeptide in the absence of dextran sulfate. At lower pH the negative far UV ellipticity increases again. In the presence of dextran sulfate at pH 5.5 aggregation at micromolar concentrations was also observed from the UV absorption spectra. This demonstrates that dextran sulfate unfolds the propeptide already at pH values below ∼5.5. Propeptides of proteases characterized in the literature are either completely unfolded or exhibit a limited content of secondary structure (38Hu Z. Haghjoo K. Jordan F. J. Biol.

We have shown that the free propeptide of cathepsin L and its fragment (PRL78) are at neutral pH folded into a compact structure with defined secondary and tertiary structure. The structure has, like the proregion in zymogen, a high content of α-helix. The near UV CD spectrum is very similar to the difference between the spectra for procathepsin and cathepsin L (compare Fig. 2 and Fig. 3A in Ref. 34Carmona E. Dufour E. Plouffe C. Takebe S. Mason P. Mort J.S. Menard R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8149-8157Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), suggesting that the conformations of the free propeptide and proregion in zymogen are probably similar. The proregion is essential for folding of cathepsin L (23Tao K. Stearns N.A. Dong J. Wu Q.L. Sahagian G.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and particularly based on its ability to fold independently, as demonstrated in this work, it is a good candidate for a folding cofactor of the mature enzyme, similar to the propeptide α-lytic protease (9Baker D. Sohl J.L. Agard D.A. Nature. 1992; 356: 263-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) or subtilisin (42Shinde U. Inouye M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 442-446Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), which, however, does fold per se. Previously it has been reported that the propeptide of cathepsin L is devoid of persistent tertiary structure (34Carmona E. Dufour E. Plouffe C. Takebe S. Mason P. Mort J.S. Menard R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8149-8157Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar); however, those measurements were performed in the presence of 10% acetonitrile and at pH 5.5, where most of the tertiary structure is already destroyed. Propeptides of papain and papaya protease IV have also been expressed and shown to contain some secondary structure (39Taylor M.A. Baker K.C. Briggs G.S. Connerton I.F. Cummings N.J. Pratt K.A. Revell D.F. Freedman R.B. Goodenough P.W. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Existence of tertiary structure in the free propeptide is particularly interesting in light of the fact that the homologues of the proregion of cathepsin L-cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte antigen-2 (CTLA-2α and CTLA-2β) are expressed in murine T-cells and mastocytes as independent proteins (43Denizot F. Brunet J.F. Roustan P. Harper K. Suzan M. Luciani M.F. Mattei M.G. Golstein P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) and are functional as inhibitors of cysteine proteases (44Delaria K. Fiorentino L. Wallace L. Tamburini P. Brownell E. Muller D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25172-25177Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This represents an interesting demonstration of a co-evolution of the enzyme and inhibitor as one protein (proenzyme), until the proregion is able to fold independently, which is a necessary condition for the independent existence of the propeptide as an autonomous protein. Of all the proregions of cysteine proteases, CTLA-2 are most similar to the proregion of cathepsin L. A phylogenetic tree of the proregions of cathepsins L, S, K, B, and H (not shown) has been constructed which suggests that divergence of CTLA-2 and a proregion of cathepsin L occurred by gene duplication after divergence of cathepsin L and other cysteine proteases. Similarity between the CTLA-2 and proregion of cathepsin L is, as in proregions of other cysteine proteases, concentrated in the first 80 residues, corresponding to the compact domain. Gene structures of the CTLA-2s are not yet known. Proregions of human and murine cathepsin L are coded by the exons 2–4 (45Ishidoh K. Kominami E. Suzuki K. Katunuma N.

https://openalex.org/W1999722793,"We have identified a novel cytoplasmic protein, leupaxin, that is preferentially expressed in hematopoietic cells and is most homologous to the focal adhesion protein, paxillin. Leupaxin possesses two types of protein interaction domains. There are four carboxyl-terminal LIM domains in leupaxin that share 70% amino acid identity and 80% similarity with those in paxillin. Paxillin LIM domains mediate localization to focal contacts. In the amino-terminal region of leupaxin there are three short stretches of approximately 13 amino acids that share 70–90% similarity with paxillin LD motifs. Paxillin LD motifs have been implicated in focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and vinculin binding resulting in the localization of FAK to focal adhesions. Leupaxin is expressed in cell types, such as macrophage, that lack FAK. We demonstrate here that leupaxin associates with a second FAK family member, PYK2. As leupaxin and PYK2 are both preferentially expressed in leukocytes they may therefore form a cell type-specific signaling complex. We also demonstrate that leupaxin is a substrate for a tyrosine kinase in lymphoid cells and thus may function in and be regulated by tyrosine kinase activity. Leupaxin is thus a phosphotyrosine protein with LD and LIM binding motifs most homologous to paxillin that may assemble and regulate PYK2 signaling complexes in leukocytes.

Cell adhesion, spreading, and migration are mediated by integrin interactions with extracellular and cell surface ligands (1Gumbiner B.M.

In adherent cell types such as epithelial cells and fibroblasts a complex of cytoplasmic proteins localizes to the termini of actin bundles at sites of integrin-dependent close cell contact with substratum or extracellular matrix proteins (3Burridge K. Fath K. Kelly T. Nuckolls G. Turner C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 487-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1701) Google Scholar). These complexes, designated focal adhesions, have been implicated in the regulation of cell locomotion, survival, and proliferation (4Lee J. Ishihara A. Jacobson K.

Focal adhesions are rich in tyrosine kinases and tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, which may reflect a role for tyrosine kinases in integrin signaling (6Parsons J.T. Parsons S.J. Curr. Opin.

PYK2 and FAK are closely related in their overall structure, and both are phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to integrin engagement, T cell receptor engagement or chemokine stimulation (12Ganju R.K.

PYK2 and FAK both associate with paxillin, p130cas, and Src (16Ganju R.K. Hatch W.C. Avraham H. Ona M.A. Druker B. Avraham S. Groopman J.E. J. Exp.

Although PYK2 possesses a focal adhesion targeting domain that is highly homologous with FAK, the majority of PYK2 displays a more diffuse cytoplasmic distribution with a small percent present in focal adhesions (18Matsuya M.

This indicates that FAK and PYK2 may possess both overlapping and unique functions. Tyrosine phosphoproteins present in focal adhesions include FAK, vinculin, zyxin, and paxillin. A second paxillin family member, Hic-5, has recently been shown to localize to focal adhesions (18Matsuya M. Sasaki H. Aoto H. Mitaka T. Nagura K. Ohba T. Ishino M. Takahashi S. Suzuki R. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). As phosphorylation of tyrosine on focal adhesion proteins can regulate their interaction with proteins that possess SH2 and phosphotyrosine-binding domains, tyrosine kinase activity can regulate some protein-protein interactions in these dynamic focal adhesion complexes (7Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Coso O.A. Gutkind J.S. Burbelo P.D. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 791-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (1104) Google Scholar, 19van der Geer P. Pawson T. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 277-280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Another domain utilized by several focal adhesion proteins to mediate interactions with other proteins is the LIM domain (20Schmeichel K.L. Beckerle M.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 211-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar). LIM domains are approximately 50 residues in length and contain conserved cysteine, histidine, and aspartate residues that form zinc binding modules (21Kosa J.L. Michelsen J.W. Louis H.A. Olsen J.I.

Biol. 1994; 1: 388-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Paxillin, Hic-5, zyxin, and cysteine-rich protein contain a tandem array of 3–4 LIM domains in their carboxyl-terminal region. Individual LIM domains demonstrate specificity in binding different proteins or motifs. The first amino-terminal LIM domain of zyxin, LIM1, supports an interaction with the cysteine-rich protein CRP (20Schmeichel K.L. Beckerle M.C. Cell. 1994; 79: 211-219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar), and paxillin LIM3 has been shown to be critical to the localization of paxillin to focal adhesions (24Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). LIM domains in Enigma, a protein that interacts with the insulin receptor and the receptor tyrosine kinase Ret, binds to specific tyrosine containing tight-turn motifs (25Wu R. Durick K. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Taylor S.S. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15934-15941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recently, sequences of approximately 13 amino acids in the amino-terminal region of paxillin have been implicated in binding to FAK and vinculin (24Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). These sequences have been designated LD motifs because they contain an invariable leucine-aspartate pair near their amino terminus. Paxillin LD motifs appear to be responsible for the localization of FAK to focal adhesions. Thus, focal adhesion proteins such as paxillin contain multiple binding domains and likely serve as scaffolds to focus and regulate specific effector molecules such as FAK to a subcellular site. We have identified a novel cytoplasmic protein, leupaxin, that is a substrate for a tyrosine kinase and thus may be functionally regulated by a protein-tyrosine kinase. Leupaxin contains LIM and LD motifs which are most homologous to paxillin, suggesting that it may serve as an adapter to regulate signaling at sites of adhesion. We demonstrate that leupaxin associates with PYK2 in lymphoid cells. Both PYK2 and leupaxin are preferentially expressed in leukocytes and have a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution. Thus leupaxin and PYK2 may form a cell type-specific signaling complex. A random sequencing screening of a human macrophage library resulted in the isolation of a partial 1.2-kb leupaxin cDNA clone. The insert from this clone was32P-labeled using a Random Primed Labeling Kit (Boehringer Mannheim) and was used as a hybridization probe to obtain a cDNA clone containing a complete coding region from a spleen cDNA library in pcDNA1/Amp (Invitrogen) (26Van der Vieren M. Le Trong H. Wood C.L. Moore P.F. St. John T. Staunton D.E. Gallatin W.M. Immunity. 1995; 3: 683-690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). The32P-labeled leupaxin probe was added to colony replicas in hybridization buffer (5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's, 1% SDS, and 45% formamide) and hybridized overnight at 42 °C. The final wash (0.5 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) was at 50 °C. Two independent 1.9-kb clones recovered after a secondary screening were fully sequenced and determined to contain identical and complete coding sequences. The entire leupaxin coding region was fused in frame to the 3′ end of the enhanced green fluorescence protein (GFP) coding sequence isolated from pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH). The resulting GFP-leupaxin chimeric sequence was subcloned into pCEP4 (pEGFP-PX2-CEP4). A lymphoblastoid line expressing an IL-8 receptor, JY8 (42Sadhu C. Masinovsky B. Staunton D.E. J. Immunol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar), was electroporated (960 μF and 250 V) with pEGFP-PX2-CEP4 (30 μg/107 cells). Transfectants were selected by culturing in media containing 0.5 mg/ml Hygromycin B. GFP-leupaxin JY8 transfectants were incubated on coverslips coated with 5 μg/ml ICAM-1/Fc for 45 min at 37 °C. An ICAM-1 substrate was used to promote spreading of JY8 and thus facilitate visualization of leupaxin subcellular distribution. Bound cells were fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde, washed with Dulbecco's PBS and then counterstained with 10 units/ml rhodamine phalloidin (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at room temperature. Coverslips were washed with Dulbecco's PBS and mounted in N-propyl gallate. Cells were visualized with Deltavision using a CCD camera to detect images through a Zeiss Axiovert microscope. A random primed labeled probe containing the entire leupaxin coding region was used to hybridize to Human Cancer Cell Line and Human Immune System Northern blots obtained from CLONTECH. Northern blots were hybridized overnight at 42 °C in hybridization solution (5 × SSPE, 10x Denhardt's, 2% SDS, 50% formamide, 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA). Blots were washed to a final stringency of 0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 50 °C. GFP-leupaxin was immunoprecipitated from JY8 transfectants using a GFP polyclonal antibody (CLONTECH). 40 × 106cells were lysed in 1.5 ml of 1% CHAPS lysis buffer containing 0.01 mg/ml each of soybean trypsin inhibitor, aprotinin, and leupeptin and 1 mm AEBSF and 2 mmNa3VO4. Immunoprecipitated GFP and GFP-leupaxin were electrophoresed through a 12% Tris-glycine gel (Novex) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore). Tyrosine phosphorylation was determined by Western blotting with the anti-phosphotyrosine mAb RC20H (Transduction Laboratories), diluted 1:2,500, incubated with blots for 1 h at room temperature with rotation. 0.5 mm phenyl phosphate was preincubated with RC20H for 40 min at 4 °C in inhibition studies. PYK2 was immunoprecipitated from JY8 transfectants expressing either GFP or GFP-leupaxin. JY8 transfectants (20 × 106 cells) were lysed in 1 ml of 1% CHAPS lysis buffer containing protease inhibitors (complete EDTA inhibitor tablet, Boehringer Mannheim) and 1 mm Na3VO4. PYK2 was immunoprecipitated with 5 μg of anti-PYK2 polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology). GFP and GFP-leupaxin were immunoprecipitated with 5 μl of anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (CLONTECH). Immunoprecipitated proteins were electrophoresed through 12% Tris-glycine gels (Novex) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). Western blotting with an anti-GFP monoclonal antibody (CLONTECH) or an anti-PYK2 mAb (P47120, Transduction Laboratories) was used to detect precipitated proteins. To identify novel macrophage proteins a random sequencing screen of a human macrophage cDNA library was conducted. From this screen a cDNA was isolated that contains an incomplete coding region homologous to the 3′ region of paxillin. This cDNA was used as a probe to isolate additional cDNAs from a spleen library. Two independent 1.9-kb cDNAs were isolated, sequenced, and found to be identical throughout their coding region. These clones contain an open reading frame encoding 385 residues (Fig.1 A) and a 5′ translational start codon in the context of a consensus Kozak sequence (data not presented). In a BLASTp search of the NCBI data base, paxillin was identified as the most homologous protein. Because the protein appears to be a relative of paxillin that is expressed preferentially in leukocytes (discussed below), we designate it leupaxin. The overall amino acid identity between leupaxin and paxillin is 37%; however the carboxyl-terminal half, residues 151–385, possesses 70% identity and 80% similarity (Fig. 1 A). This region of leupaxin and paxillin contains four LIM domains. The homology between individual LIM domains range from 67 to 76% identity. Other proteins possessing less homologous LIM domains includes Hic-5 (54% identity), PINCH protein (42% identity), and Enigma (36% identity). LIM domains are approximately 50–60 amino acids in length and contain three conserved residues, cysteine, histidine, and aspartate, spaced such that they form a structure that chelates zinc. Leupaxin LIM domains each contain two such zinc fingers with the consensus motif CX 2CX 16HX 2(C/H)X 2CX 2CX 17CX 2(D/H/C) (Fig. 1 A). LIM domains have been implicated in interactions with other LIM domains as well as with tyrosine-containing motifs in tight turns of membrane proteins (25Wu R. Durick K. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Taylor S.S. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15934-15941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Recently, paxillin LIM3 has been shown to mediate localization to focal adhesions and LIM2 appears to cooperate in this localization (24Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), but the focal adhesion ligand for paxillin LIM3 has not yet been identified. The amino-terminal region of leupaxin is shorter than paxillin and demonstrates three short stretches of high homology (Fig. 1,A and B). Residues 1–15, 85–102, and 127–149 share 53%, 56%, and 63% identity with paxillin. Considering conserved substitutions the similarity between these sequences is 90%, 72%, and 75% (Fig. 1 B). Within these homologous sequences are LD motifs, first identified as a 13-amino acid motif in paxillin (24Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). These motifs are designated LD due to the invariable leucine and aspartate pair near their amino terminus. The homology around leupaxin and paxillin LD motifs extends into flanking residues. Leupaxin possesses three LD motifs which align, with gaps between motifs, to paxillin LD1, LD3, and LD4 (Fig. 1 A). There is a potential fourth LD motif in leupaxin at residues 39–51. However, unlike other LD motifs, this sequence only contains the three invariable residues and no additional homology (Fig. 1, A and B). Another paxillin-related protein Hic-5 also possesses four LD motifs (18Matsuya M. Sasaki H. Aoto H. Mitaka T. Nagura K. Ohba T. Ishino M. Takahashi S. Suzuki R. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) that can be aligned with leupaxin and paxillin (Fig.1 B). Thus the positioning and degree of homology between LD motifs can differ, and this may impart unique binding properties to leupaxin, paxillin, and Hic-5. LD motifs were first characterized in paxillin and are implicated in binding to FAK and vinculin (24Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 27Tachibana K. Sato T., N, D.A. Morimoto C. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 182: 1089-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Sequences encompassing paxillin LD2 and LD3 appear to bind to FAK whereas LD2 alone appears to mediate association with vinculin. Binding to paxillin LD2 and LD3 appears to mediate localization of FAK to focal adhesions (24Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Thus paxillin functions as an adapter via LD and LIM motif interactions. Leupaxin does not possess a LD motif with significant homology to paxillin LD2 (Fig. 1 B). In the absence of a LD motif corresponding to LD2 a potential interaction between leupaxin and FAK or vinculin would therefore be predicted to be relatively weak. Leupaxin would not be predicted to associate with FAK in monocytes or macrophages that express leupaxin but not FAK (28De Nichilo M.O. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11016-11022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 29Choi K. Kennedy M. Keller G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The structural similarities between members of the paxillin family suggest that leupaxin may also serve an adapter function and localize signaling molecules to certain subcellular sites. To determine the range of cell types and tissues that express leupaxin the leupaxin cDNA was used to probe blots of mRNA isolated from various sources. Consistent with the size of the leupaxin cDNA the probe hybridized to a 2.4-kb mRNA (Fig. 2). This mRNA was present in lymphoid tissues including spleen, lymph node, thymus, and appendix. There was markedly less leupaxin mRNA in bone marrow and fetal liver which required 4 times longer exposure of film to hybridized blots for detection (data not presented). Leupaxin mRNA was also detected in peripheral blood lymphocytes and the hematopoietic cell lines HL60, Molt4, and Raji (Fig. 2). Leupaxin mRNA in four different epithelial cell lines was only detected after 4 times longer exposure of hybridized blots to film (data not presented). Leupaxin mRNA levels therefore appear to be markedly greater in lymphoid tissues and certain hematopoietic cell lines relative to non-hematopoietic cell types. It is interesting that bone marrow cells appear to contain low levels of leupaxin mRNA relative to lymphocytes and lymphoid tissues suggesting that leupaxin expression in hematopoietic cells may increase with differentiation. To begin to determine a subcellular localization where leupaxin may function we examined the localization of a GFP-leupaxin chimeric protein in a lymphoblastoid cell line, JY8. To facilitate subcellular localization JY8 cells were incubated on an ICAM-1-coated substrate to promote cell spreading. ICAM-1 is a ligand for the only CD18 integrin, CD11a/CD18, expressed in JY8 (42Sadhu C. Masinovsky B. Staunton D.E. J. Immunol. 1998; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar). Leupaxin was found to be diffusely distributed in the F-actin cortical cytoskeleton that stains with rhodamine-phalloidin (Fig. 3). Leupaxin was present in the proximal regions of filopodia-like projections but was excluded or less represented in their distal tips. Leupaxin also localizes to a region adjacent to the F-actin-rich cortical cytoskeleton in JY8. Thus GFP-leupaxin is rather diffusely distributed in JY8 corresponding with the distribution of an associated protein, PYK2 (discussed below). GFP is uniformly distributed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus (data not presented). It remains to be determined if leupaxin is present in complexes that approximate those in adherent cell-type focal adhesions. Focal adhesions in highly motile cells such as leukocytes have been suggested to be relatively diffuse, much smaller, greater in number, and more uniformly distributed (1Gumbiner B.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 345-357Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2929) Google Scholar, 35Kolega J. Shure M.S. Chen W.T. Young N.D. J. Cell Sci. 1982; 54: 23-34PubMed Google Scholar). Tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin may support signaling following integrin engagement. Leupaxin contains 10 potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Fig. 1). To determine if leupaxin is a tyrosine kinase substrate the GFP-leupaxin chimera expressed in JY8 was tested for reactivity to a phosphotyrosine-specific mAb. The GFP-leupaxin chimera migrates as a 78-kDa protein on SDS-PAGE whereas GFP migrates as a 33-kDa protein (Fig.4, right blot). The difference between GFP-leupaxin and GFP, 45 kDa, is consistent with the calculated size of 43 kDa for leupaxin. The GFP-leupaxin fusion protein immunoprecipitated from lysates of JY8 transfectants bound an anti-phosphotyrosine mAb (Fig. 4). The binding of the anti-phosphotyrosine mAb was inhibited by phenyl phosphate (500 μm) confirming the specificity of the anti-phosphotyrosine mAb interaction. There was no detectable binding of the phosphotyrosine specific mAb to GFP which was expressed at equivalent or greater levels than leupaxin. These results indicate that leupaxin is a substrate for a tyrosine kinase in lymphoid cells. Leupaxin function may be regulated by a tyrosine kinase activity. Paxillin is also phosphorylated on tyrosine, and this phosphorylation can be induced with cell adhesion or by engagement of integrins with antibodies (36Turner C.E. Miller J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 893-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1182) Google Scholar, 38Fuortes M. Jin W.W.

Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 2401-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar), and in response to mitogens that signal through G protein-coupled seven transmembrane receptors (38Fuortes M. Jin W.W.

Chem. 1993; 268: 22060-22065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin occurs in the process of cell adhesion, motility, and growth. The regulation of leupaxin phosphorylation by various stimuli and its functional consequences are currently being addressed. Leupaxin contains LD motifs homologous to those in paxillin and Hic-5 suggesting that it may interact with FAK or PYK2. The leupaxin cDNA, however, was isolated from macrophages where FAK expression has not been detected (28De Nichilo M.O. Yamada K.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11016-11022Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 29Choi K. Kennedy M. Keller G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 5747-5751Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). We therefore determined whether leupaxin associated with PYK2, a protein-tyrosine kinase closely related to FAK and expressed preferentially in leukocytes and brain. Immunoblots clearly demonstrate that PYK2 co-immunoprecipitated with GFP-leupaxin (Fig.5 A). This association was specific for leupaxin because PYK2 did not co-immunoprecipitate with GFP although equivalent levels of GFP and GFP-leupaxin were immunoprecipitated from JY8 lysates. We also demonstrate in the reciprocal experiment that GFP-leupaxin was co-immunoprecipitated with PYK2 from lysates of JY8 transfectants (Fig. 5 B). Again, this association was specific for leupaxin as GFP was not found to associate with PYK2 even though PYK2 was immunoprecipitated at equivalent levels from lysates of JY8 cells expressing GFP-leupaxin or GFP (Fig. 5 B). In addition, control antibodies did not co-immunoprecipitate either PYK2 or leupaxin (data not presented). Thus when overexpressed leupaxin complexes with PYK2 in JY8 cells. The association of leupaxin with PYK2 may specifically support PYK2 functions in leukocytes. PYK2 is a FAK family member that is expressed preferentially in leukocytes and brain (9Avraham S. London R. Fu Y. Ota S. Hiregowdara D. Li J. Jiang S. Pasztor L.M. White R.A. Groopman J.E. Avraham H. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 228-232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Leupaxin, however, is expressed preferentially in leukocytes and is expressed at relatively very low levels in brain (data not presented). Thus the potential role of leupaxin in PYK2 function may predominate in hematopoietic cells. PYK2 may be predicted to mediate functions overlapping with those of FAK including cell motility, cell spreading, and apoptosis. Leupaxin may serve to localize PYK2 to different subcellular sites to support or regulate these functions. It will be of interest to determine the role of leupaxin in PYK2 function relative to paxillin and Hic-5 (18Matsuya M. Sasaki H. Aoto H. Mitaka T. Nagura K. Ohba T. Ishino M. Takahashi S. Suzuki R. Sasaki T. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1003-1014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Leupaxin possesses LD and LIM binding motifs which are highly homologous to those in paxillin that appear to function in the assembly of focal adhesions (24Brown M.C. Perrotta J.A. Turner C.E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1109-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 37Burridge K. Turner C.E. Romer L.H. J.

Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1469) Google Scholar). Similar to paxillin and Hic-5, leupaxin associates with PYK2 and is phosphorylated on tyrosine. We suggest a role for leupaxin in localizing or modulating PYK2 containing signaling complexes in response to integrin engagement or G-protein-coupled receptor stimulation.

Such platelets rapidly and transiently form phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3) and a small amount of phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2). After aggregation, a larger amount of PtdIns(3,4)P2 is generated. We report that this latter PtdIns(3,4)P2 arises largely through wortmannin-inhibitable generation of PtdIns3P and then phosphorylation by PtdIns3P 4-kinase (PtdIns3P 4-K), a novel pathway apparently contingent upon the activation of the Ca2+-dependent protease calpain. Elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ by ionophore, without integrin/ligand binding, is insufficient to activate the pathway. PtdIns3P 4-K is not the recently described “PIP5KIIα.” Cytoskeletal activities of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and PtdIns3P 4-K increase after aggregation. Prior to aggregation, PtdIns3P 4-K can be regulated negatively by the βγ subunit of heterotrimeric GTP-binding protein. After aggregation, PtdIns3P 4-K calpain-dependently loses its susceptibility to Gβγ and is, in addition, activated. Both PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 have been shown to stimulate PKBα/Akt phosphorylation and activation by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1. We find that activation of PKBα/Akt in platelets is phosphorylation-dependent and biphasic; the initial phase is PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-dependent and more efficient, whereas the second phase depends upon PtdIns(3,4)P2generated after aggregation. There is thus potential for both pre- and post-aggregation-dependent signaling by PKBα/Akt. Stimulation of platelet thrombin receptors or protein kinase C causes fibrinogen-dependent aggregation that is a function of integrin αIIbβ3activation.

Each of these enzyme activities results in the generation of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 (PtdInsP3) by phosphorylation of PtdIns(4,5)P2; shortly thereafter, a small amount of PtdIns(3,4)P2 is produced, either by hydrolysis of PtdInsP3 or phosphorylation of PtdIns4P (2Carter A.N.

After 5–10 min, however, a large increase in PtdIns(3,4)P2can be observed with THR-R agonists, as described below.

Hence, elucidation of the routes by which these second messengers are synthesized and metabolized has potentially important implications for cell signaling. PI3Kγ is stimulated by Gβγ, whereas activation of p85/PI3K appears to be down-stream of a protein kinase C (stimulated after THR-R-dependent activation of phospholipase C). Activation of p85/PI3K, but not of PI3Kγ, can be achieved by the addition to platelets of protein kinase C-activating PMA (13Zhang J. Zhang J. Shattil S.J. Cunningham M.C. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6265-6272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Apparently, it is p85/PI3K, rather than PI3Kγ, whose activity contributes to the re-organization of integrin αIIbβ3 (13Zhang J. Zhang J. Shattil S.J. Cunningham M.C. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6265-6272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), allowing it to bind fibrinogen (FIB), which thereby facilitates platelet aggregation and subsequent signaling events. After platelets aggregate, the substantial burst of PtdIns(3,4)P2accumulation that occurs is prevented by the integrin antagonist RGDS, removal of Ca2+, or the absence of integrin αIIbβ3 (14Sorisky A.

Since one of several proteins cleaved by calpain is PtdIns(3,4)P2 4-phosphatase, leading to decreased activity, it had been suggested that inhibition of 4-phosphatase is responsible for the aggregation/calpain-dependent rise in PtdIns(3,4)P2 (17Norris F.A. Atkins R.C. Majerus P.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 10987-10989Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Our recent data, however, point to another explanation (18Banfić H. Tang X. Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Chen C. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Integrin αIIbβ3can be activated directly by LIBS (antibody Fab fragment to β3; Ref. 20Frelinger III, A.L. Du X.P. Plow E.F. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol.

We have found that LIBS+FIB-induced accumulation of PtdIns(3,4)P2, which is inhibited by calpain inhibitors such as calpeptin, cannot be accounted for by inhibition of 4-phosphatase (18Banfić H. Tang X. Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Chen C. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Instead, a new synthetic route is triggered, in which no PtdInsP3 is formed, but PtdIns3P is generated transiently by PtdIns 3-K in a calpeptin- and wortmannin-sensitive manner, and PtdIns (3,4)P2 arises through phosphorylation of PtdIns3P by Ptd Ins3P 4-K (18Banfić H. Tang X. Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Chen C. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The PtdIns(3,4)P2 that is formed after aggregation is generated primarily by this pathway and the increase in the activity of PtdIns3P 4-K is also inhibited by calpeptin. Moreover, the PtdInsP3-independent generation of PtdIns(3,4)P2 by this route leads to PKB/Akt activation in vivo. The purposes of the present study are to determine whether the new pathway is triggered in PMA+FIB and THR-R+FIB-activated platelets, whether PKB/Akt is activated only by PtdIns(3,4)P2 or by both PtdInsP3 and PtdIns(3,4)P2 in these cells, whether such activation(s) is/are dependent upon PKB/Akt phosphorylation, which PKB isoforms are stimulated, and to begin to address how PtdIns3P 4-K is regulated.

After immunoprecipitation or after “mock” immunoprecipitation (resulting from incubation with antibody buffer and protein G-Sepharose), supernatants were assayed as above for PtdInsP kinase activities, and in some cases, synthetic diC16PtdIns5P or diC16PtdIns4P was used as a substrate. For separations of glycerophospho-Ins(3,5)P2(derived from PtdIns(3,5)P2) and glycerophospho-Ins(3,4)P2 (derived from PtdIns(3,4)P2), HPLC fractions were collected every 10 s and monitored by scintillation spectrophotometry, rather than by Flo-One Beta detection (23Kucera G.L.

As shown in Figs. 1 and2, SFLLRN and PMA were each able to induce transient accumulations of labeled PtdInsP3, PtdIns3P, and sustained accumulations of PtdIns(3,4)P2 in32P-labeled platelets. Only the increases in PtdIns3P and PtdIns(3,4)P2, however, were dependent upon the presence of FIB (Figs. 1 (B and C) and 2 (B andC)), the former totally dependent, and the latter largely FIB-dependent. The effects of FIB were linear up to 200 μg/ml (data not shown). These effects were very similar to those resulting from exposure of platelets to LIBS (which directly activates αIIbβ3)+FIB, under aggregating conditions (18Banfić H. Tang X. Batty I.H. Downes C.P.

Separation to base line was achieved, and we observed that PtdIns(3,5)P2 contained a very minor fraction of the amount of 32P seen for PtdIns(3,4)P2. After exposure of platelets to PMA±FIB for 10 min, 32P in PtdIns(3,5)P2 increased 2–3-fold with FIBversus FIB-free controls, whereas [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2 increased over 20-fold (Fig. 3). The addition of RGDS with PMA had no effect in comparison with PMA alone. Accumulations of PtdInsP3, which do not occur with LIBS+FIB (18Banfić H. Tang X. Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Chen C.

All increases in 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides were inhibited more than 90% by wortmannin (data not shown). After platelets were incubated with Ca2+ ionophore with stirring, but aggregation was prevented by omitting FIB and including RGDS to prevent binding of secreted FIB, a rapid increase in PtdInsP3 and a similarly rapid, but modest, increase in PtdIns(3,4)P2 levels occurred (Fig.4). There was no increase, however, in PtdIns3P.Figure 2Effects with time of PMA±FIB on accumulations of 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides in platelets. 32P-Labeled platelets, as in Fig. 1, were incubated for various periods with PMA (open symbols) or PMA+FIB (filled symbols).

As was true for LIBS+FIB-stimulated platelets, position 4 was hotter than position 3, and labeling of position 1 was negligible after platelets were aggregated in response to either SFLLRN or PMA. This indicated that32P was added to position 4 after 3, i.e. that the predominant synthetic pathway for PtdIns(3,4)P2 is PtdIns3P → PtdIns(3,4)P2. In contrast, as is true for platelets exposed briefly (20 s or 60 s) to thrombin or SFLLRN (2Carter A.N. Huang R. Sorisky A. Downes C.P. Rittenhouse S.E. Biochem. J. 1994; 301: 415-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,18Banfić H. Tang X. Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Chen C. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol.

Under these conditions, the predominant pathway for PtdIns(3,4)P2synthesis could be either PtdIns(4,5)P2 → PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 → PtdIns(3,4)P2 or PtdIns4P → PtdIns(3,4)P2. Immunoprecipitations with antibodies specific for PKBα, -β, or -γ revealed that only PKBα had significant activity, and only this activity was stimulated when platelets were activated. PKBα and PDK1 were found to be present in both Triton-soluble and CSK fractions, as detected by Western blotting; however, when the same amount of CSK protein from resting and activated platelets was compared, detectable PKBα and PDK1 did not increase. Total CSK protein did increase, however, in activated platelets, rising 2–3-fold; therefore, the amounts of PKBα and PDK1 increased as CSK-associated proteins. The majority of PKBα and PDK1 was present in the Triton-soluble fraction of platelets (data not shown). In contrast to the case for LIBS+FIB (18Banfić H. Tang X. Batty I.H. Downes C.P. Chen C. Rittenhouse S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar), in which PKBα activity increased (3-fold) rather late (maximally at 10–12 min), following platelet aggregation and paralleling PtdIns(3,4)P2 levels (20–30-fold), PKBα activity in response to SFLLRN±FIB increased much more rapidly, and to a greater degree (8–9-fold), following the increases in PtdInsP3 (8-fold) after a 15-s lag (Fig.6). This was totally inhibited by wortmannin (data not shown). After 10 min, however, when PtdInsP3 had decreased to control (agonist-free) levels, PKBα activity had also returned to base-line levels, except where FIB was present (Fig. 7 A). The presence of FIB had no effect on accumulations of PtdInsP3(shown as well in Fig. 1 A), including the return to base-line levels, but had a marked enhancing effect on PtdIns(3,4)P2 accumulations (26-fold; Figs. 1 Cand Fig. 7 A) and PKBα activity (3-fold; Fig.7 A). Calpeptin (IC50 1 μm) did not inhibit increases in PtdInsP3 or early activation of PKBα (Fig. 7 A; 2 min), but totally inhibited the rises in PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PKBα activity associated with later incubations in the presence of FIB (Fig. 7 A; 10 min). The same phenomena were observed when PMA was used as an agonist, in place of SFLLRN (Fig. 7 B). “Second phase” stimulations of PKBα and accumulations of PtdIns(3,4)P2 in response to either SFLLRN+FIB or PMA+FIB were thus similar to the increases observed with LIBS+FIB (18Banfić H.

As in Fig. 6, formation of [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2 and [32P]PtdInsP3 were quantitated after platelets were exposed to SFLLRN (A) or PMA (B). Two incubation periods were examined and conditions varied with respect to the presence of FIB, RGDS, and prior exposure of platelets to calpeptin. The data with calpeptin are for its maximum effective concentration. The IC50 for calpeptin was 1 μm. Calpeptin, FIB, and RGDS had no effect on basal activity of PKBα or radiolabeling of phosphoinositides. Data shown are presented as a multiple of agonist-free (basal) values and are representative of three or four experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In order to determine whether phosphorylation of PKBα, presumably by PDK1, was required for its early stage and late stage activations, immunoprecipitated PKBα from platelets incubated with or without SFLLRN (2 min) or with LIBS+FIB (stirring, 10 min) were incubated with or without protein phosphatase and then phosphatase inhibitor prior to assay of PKBα activity.

Symons M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1615-1620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 11Malcolm K.C. Elliott C.M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13135-13139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Glucosylation of RhoA by toxin B from Clostridium difficile also blocks activation of PLD by muscarinic cholinergic receptors in HEK cells (24Schmidt M. Rumenapp U. Bienek C. Keller J. von Eichel-Streiber C. Jakobs K.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2422-2426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). These data suggest that RhoA plays a crucial role in PLD activation in vivo by certain extracellular signals. Recent data showing that constitutively active V14 RhoA activates PLD when cotransfected with rat brain PLD (rPLD1) in COS-7 cells (25Park S-K. Provost J.P. Bae C.D. Ho W-T. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29263-29271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) also provide evidence for an in vivo function of RhoA in PLD activation. Although there is no available evidence that Cdc42Hs can activate PLD in vivo, there is a report indicating a role for Rac1 (10Hess J.A. Ross A.H. Qiu R.-G. Symons M. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 1615-1620Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The molecular mechanism by which RhoA activates PLD is still obscure. The mechanism probably involves direct interaction to some extent, since RhoA can activate homogeneous PLD in vitro (22Hammond S.M. Jenco J.M. Nakashima S. Cadwallader K. Gu Q. Cook S. Nozawa Y. Prestwich G.D. Frohman M.A. Morris A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3860-3868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 23Min D-S. Park S.-K. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7044-7051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, this does not exclude the possibility of the operation of indirect mechanisms in intact cells. For example, a cytosolic factor has been reported to be required for complete activation of PLD activity by RhoA in human neutrophil membranes (26Kwak J.Y. Lopez I. Uhlinger D.J. Ryu S.H. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27093-27098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Moreover, many binding proteins for Rho family proteins have been discovered, including rhophilin (27Fujisawa K. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Saito Y. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23022-23028Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) and various protein kinases such as p160ROCK, p65PAK, and protein kinase N (28Nakagawa O. Fujisawa K. Ishizaki T. Saito Y. Nakao K. Narumiya S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 392: 189-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar, 29Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z-S. Lim L.

Science. 1996; 271: 645-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Thus, there is a possibility that these molecules may be involved in PLD activation by Rho proteins. To elucidate the molecular signal transduction pathway between RhoA and PLD, we decided to delineate which amino residues in the RhoA molecule are responsible for PLD activation and to compare these with the interaction sites for other proteins that bind to RhoA. We also examined the residues responsible for the greater efficacy of RhoA compared with Cdc42Hs in activating PLD and found that a single residue was involved. RhoB and Rac2 cDNAs were cloned by PCR from a human placental cDNA library, and RhoA and Cdc42Hs cDNAs were kind gifts from Dr. R. Cerione (Cornell University). Ha-Ras cDNA was the kind gift of Dr. I. Macara (University of Virginia). For baculoviral expression of rPLD1, pBluebacHis2 and a transfection kit from Invitrogen were used. pBacgus2cp and a transfection kit from Novagen were used for small G protein expression in Sf9 cells. Sf9 cells, BL21-competent cells, DH5α-competent cells, S-protein-agarose, thrombin, and enterokinase were from Novagen. Plasmid purification kits and nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin were from Qiagen. Taq DNA polymerase, dNTP, [33P]ddNTP, the Thermosequenase cyclic sequencing kit, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, ECL reagent, GSH-Sepharose beads, and pGEX4T1 were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.Pfu DNA polymerase was from Stratagene. T4 polynucleotide kinase, T4 DNA ligase, Genenase I, Factor Xa, and restriction enzymes were from New England Biolabs. Acrylamide, bisacrylamide, and polyprep columns were from Bio-Rad. The OPEC oligonucleotide purification kit was from CLONTECH. Custom oligonucleotides were from Operon. Anti-RhoA and anti-Cdc42 antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). GTPγS was from Boehringer Mannheim. Phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, and anti-flag antibody were from Sigma. Phosphatidylethanolamine was from Avanti. Phosphatidyl[choline-methyl- 3H]choline and GTPγ[35S] were from NEN Life Science products. Unlabeled geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and [3H]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate were from ARC. Other reagents were from Sigma. GST fusion protein expression was used to facilitate purification and subsequent protease digestion for producing free small G proteins. In some cases, the G proteins were prepared without any N-terminal additional amino acids by introducing the recognition sequence of the proteases at the N-terminal end of the G protein using PCR with Pfu polymerase. The lower primers contained the protease recognition sequences DDDDK(GATGACGACGACAAG) for enterokinase, PGAAHY(CCAGGAGCAGCACACTAC) for genenase I (New England Biolabs), and IEGK(ATCGAAGGAAAG) for factor Xa attached to theBamHI site of pGEX4T1, and the upper primer contained theEcoRI site of pGEX4T1. The resulting modified pGEX4T1 had an additional protease recognition sequence at the C-terminal side of the original thrombin digestion site. For subcloning in these modified vectors, RhoA, Cdc42Hs and Ha-Ras cDNA were modified by PCR so that the 5′-end of cDNA started from the ATG codon, while the 3′-end had an EcoRI site right after the termination codon. The 5′-end of the amplified small G protein cDNA was blunt end-ligated to the introduced protease site of the modified pGEX4T1, while the 3′-end was ligated to the EcoRI site of the vector. All primers for blunt end ligation were gel-purified, and the resulting expression constructs were sequenced to ensure that the cDNA insert was ligated in frame to GST. Point mutations were introduced into RhoA in a similar manner. For example, the F39A mutation was introduced in a lower primer (Val35–Tyr42, ATAGTTCTCGGCCACTGTGGGCAC (mutation underlined)). The RhoA cDNA fragment down to Tyr42 was amplified byPfu DNA polymerase using the phosphorylated mutated lower primer and an upper primer containing the DDDK sequence (GATGACGACGACAAGATGGCTGGCCATCCGGAAG). The remaining part of RhoA cDNA (Val43 to the end) was obtained by PCR using a phosphorylated upper primer (Val43–Val48; GTGGCAGATATCGAGGTG) and a lower primer containing the termination codon (underlined) and an EcoRI site (Gly189 to the end; CCGGAATTCTCACAAGACAAGGCACCCAGATTT). These two amplified RhoA cDNA fragments were ligated for 2 h at 16 °C. The final F39A RhoA cDNA was prepared by PCR using the ligation product as the template in which the upper primer contained a flag sequence and BamHI site (CGGGATCCATGGACTACTTTGATGACGACGACAAGATG) and the lower primer was same as for PCR of the RhoA cDNA fragment (Val43 to the end). A similar strategy to that described above was employed for the expression of chimeric small G proteins except for the introduction of the flag tag sequence (MDYFDDDDK), which has an enterokinase recognition sequence. Blunt end ligation of cDNA fragments generated by PCR, using either gel-purified or high pressure liquid chromatography-purified primers, was used for constructing chimeric cDNA. The corresponding parts of chimeric cDNA were generated by PCR, in which the primers for N-terminal ends had the DDDDK sequence upstream to the initiation codon, while the primers for ligation sites were phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase at 37 °C for 1 h to ensure correctly oriented ligation. The corresponding PCR fragment pairs were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated by T4 DNA ligase at 16 °C for 2 h. Final chimeric cDNA constructs were produced by PCR using the ligated PCR fragments as templates. The upper primers had both the flag tag sequence and the BamHI site, while the lower primers had the EcoRI site. In case of the Ha-Ras lower primer, the C-terminal sequence was mutated to CVLL for in vitro geranylgeranylation. After gel purification, the final chimeric cDNA was ligated into the BamHI andEcoRI sites of pGEX4T1. The DNA sequence of each chimera and mutant was checked by sequencing. Since the isoprenyl moiety of Rho family small G proteins is required for the activation of PLD in vitro(26Kwak J.Y. Lopez I. Uhlinger D.J. Ryu S.H. Lambeth J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27093-27098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), we also expressed geranylgeranylated RhoA, Cdc42Hs, and chimeras between them using the baculovirus system. In this case, we used the pBacgus2cp vector, which contains both N-terminal S-tag and His tag and an enterokinase digestion site upstream to the ATG codon of the inserted sequence. Each construct was introduced into the BL21 or DH5α E. colistrain. Overnight bacterial culture was seeded into a 100× volume ofLB/ampicillin and cultured for 2 h (BL21) or 4 h (DH5α) at 37 °C. Bacteria were induced by adding isopropylthioglucoside to a final concentration of 0.2 mmand further cultivated for 3 h. In the case of low expression of soluble protein, induction was done at 16 °C for 12–16 h. After centrifugation, the bacterial pellet was resuspended in sonication buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and lysed by sonication. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 30 min, 150 μl of GSH beads was added to the supernatant and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with continuous rocking. The beads were then transferred to a Polyprep column and washed 4 times with 10 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 500 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA solution. The GST fusion proteins were eluted by 10 mm GSH in 50 mmTris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA. The GSH in the eluate was removed by dialysis against 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA solution. Purified GST fusion proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie Blue staining. The GST portion of the fusion protein was removed by thrombin digestion. In those cases where no additional amino acid at the N terminus was required, the G protein portion was directly released from the GST fusion protein using the appropriate protease. In all protease digestion reactions, 1 unit of protease was used for digestion of 50 μg of protein, and the digestion procedure was monitored by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Recombinant baculoviruses were prepared using the method recommended by manufacturer. Briefly, each expression construct was co-transfected with baculoviral genomic DNA into Sf9 cells. After staining with X-gluc, three blue plaques were selected. Each viral preparation from positive plaques was reinfected into Sf9 cells independently. At 3 days postinfection, the medium was saved for the viral stock, and the remaining infected cells were subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-RhoA or anti-Cdc42Hs antibodies. The recombinant viruses were infected into 5 × 107Sf9 cells in 10-fold excess. At 3 days postinfection, cells were collected and resuspended in a 10× volume of the lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 10 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Expressed small G proteins were purified from cytosol or crude membranes, respectively. Cells were lysed by passing through a 25-gauge needle 10 times. After unlysed cells were removed by centrifuging at 500 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000 × gfor 1 h. The crude membrane fraction was dissolved in a 10× volume of the lysis buffer containing 1% octylglucoside. Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (300 μl) was added to the cytosolic or membrane fractions and incubated at 4 °C for 2 h with continuous rocking. The resin was transferred to a column and washed three times with 10 ml of lysis buffer without detergent. The column was further washed five times with 5 ml of a wash buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 20 mm imidazole). The small G protein was eluted with an elution buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 50 mm, NaCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 100 mm imidazole) in seven 0.5-ml fractions. Each fraction was subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Coomassie staining to check size and purity. In the case of nontagged versions of RhoA, the G protein was released directly from the tagged protein bound to S-protein-agarose (Novagen) by enterokinase digestion. The amounts of active small G proteins were determined by GTPγ[35S] binding. The purified small G proteins were incubated on ice for 10 min with 5 mm EDTA for stripping of bound guanine nucleotides. GTPγ[35S]binding was performed as described (31Zheng Y Hart M.J. Cerione R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 77-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 10 mm for stopping the reaction after a 10-min incubation at 37 °C. GTPγ[35S] bound to small G proteins was recovered by filtration through nitrocellulose filters, and the radioactivity was measured by a scintillation spectrometry. Small G proteins (60 pmol) were incubated with geranylgeranyl transferase at 37 °C for 30 min as described (32Zhang F.L. Diehl R.E. Kohl N.E. Gibbs J.B. Giros B. Casey P.J. Omer C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3175-3180Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The total reaction volume was 50 μl and contained 20 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.7, 20 mm KCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 μmZnCl2, and 10 μm geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. The modified small G proteins were directly used forin vitro PLD assay or stored at −70 °C. To check the efficiency of geranylgeranylation, a parallel reaction containing 1 μCi of [1-3H]geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate was run for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by adding SDS to a final concentration of 4%, and the radioactivity in the geranylgeranylated small G protein precipitated by 15% trichloracetic acid was measured by scintillation spectrometry. rPLD1 was expressed as a hexahistidine-tagged protein in Sf9 cells and purified by Ni2+-agarose affinity chromatography as described by Minet al. (23Min D-S. Park S.-K. Exton J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7044-7051Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). It was quantified by the Bio-Rad protein microassay. Geranylgeranylated small G proteins (60 pmol) were incubated with 5 mm EDTA on ice for 10 min and then with 0.5 mm GTPγS at 37 °C for 10 min. At the end of the incubation, MgCl2 was added to a final concentration of 10 mm. The GTPγS-loaded G proteins were added directly to an in vitro PLD assay mixture consisting of 20 ng of rPLD1 and phospholipid vesicles (phosphatidylethanolamine/phosphatidylinositol 4,5-P2/phosphatidylcholine; 16:1.4:1) containing 0.5 μCi of [choline-methyl- 3H]phosphatidylcholine. The assay was performed at 37 °C for 30 min or 1 h as described (33Hammond S.M. Altshuller Y.M. Sung T-C. Rudge S.A. Rose K. Engebrecht J. Morris A.J. Frohman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29640-29643Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) except for the following modifications. Dithiothreitol was added to a final concentration of 2.5 mm, and all incubations contained 0.25 μm GTPγS. At the end of the incubation, lipids were precipitated by 5.6% trichloroacetic acid with 0.28% bovine serum albumin as carrier and removed by centrifugation. The activity of PLD was determined by the radioactivity ([3H]choline) in 300 μl of the supernatant. We tested both the bacterial and insect cell expression systems for setting up a fast and efficient system for the production of small G proteins. As expected, geranylgeranylated RhoA expressed in Sf9 cells activated purified rPLD1 about 15-fold, while unmodified RhoA expressed in E. coli activated it only 4-fold (Fig. 1 A). Initial results indicated that the GST portion needed to be removed for activation of rPLD1 in the case of GST fusion proteins expressed in bacteria (data not shown). However, the presence of a short N-terminal tag (flag tag or S-tag) had little effect on rPLD1 activation by either prenylated (Sf9) or unmodified (E. coli) RhoA (Fig.1 A). rPLD1 activation by Sf9 RhoA was maximal with 0.1–0.2 μm bound GTPγS, whereas activation of rPLD1 by unmodified RhoA required over 1 μm bound GTPγS. Cdc42Hs, a G protein closely related to RhoA, also needed geranylgeranylation for significant rPLD1 activation (Fig.1 B). No activation of rPLD1 was observed with the G proteins in the absence of GTPγS (data not shown). These data show that isoprenyl modification of Rho family proteins enhances their potency and efficacy for activation of rPLD1 in vitro. We next tested in vitro geranylgeranylation of RhoA expressed in E. coli. The in vitrogeranylgeranylation reaction was proportional to the concentration of RhoA and Cdc42Hs added. However, the average efficiency of in vitro geranylgeranylation of RhoA was 30%, while that of Cdc42Hs was 20%. When geranylgeranylated RhoA from E. coli was compared with RhoA expressed in Sf9 cells, the two forms showed almost the same rPLD1 activation efficacy (Fig. 1 C). Because we could monitor the extent of in vitro geranylgeranylation of the G proteins expressed in bacteria, we utilized these prenylated proteins for the rest of the experiments. In these studies, the concentrations of the G proteins, including chimeras, were routinely expressed as the concentrations of the geranylgeranylated GTPγS-bound species. In these experiments, 0.03 and 0.06 μmGTPγS-bound geranylgeranylated G proteins were used, since these concentrations produced maximal or nearly maximal stimulation of rPLD1 (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6). We compared rPLD1 activation capabilities among RhoA, RhoB, Cdc42Hs, Rac2, and Ha-Ras. 2Rac1 was not tested because the bacterially expressed protein was not geranylgeranylated efficiently. RhoA and RhoB were equally efficacious, and Cdc42Hs and Rac2 showed about one-third the activation of rPLD1 produced by RhoA, while Ha-Ras had no effect on rPLD1 (Fig. 2). Based on these results, we selected Cdc42Hs and Ha-Ras as partners for chimeric constructs with RhoA to explore the PLD-interacting sites on RhoA in vitro. Because the amino acid sequence homology between RhoA and Ha-Ras is limited, especially in the C-terminal two-thirds of RhoA, the possibility that chimeras between these two proteins might have significant conformational differences was considered. Thus, we tested both RhoA/Ha-Ras and RhoA/Cdc42Hs chimeric proteins. We initially made four different RhoA/Cdc42Hs chimeric proteins. Chimera CRR, in which the N-terminal 58 amino acids of RhoA including the switch I region were substituted with the corresponding region of Cdc42Hs (Fig. 3 A), significantly, lost rPLD1 activation ability (Fig. 3 B). However, chimera RCC, made by replacing the N-terminal 56 amino acids of Cdc42Hs with the corresponding region of RhoA (Fig. 3 A), showed significantly greater rPLD1 activation than wild type Cdc42Hs (Fig. 3 B). These data indicate that the N-terminal region of RhoA, including the switch I region, contains a rPLD1-interacting site. Chimera RCR in which an internal sequence (Asp59-Met157) of RhoA, including the switch II region and inserted helix, was changed to the corresponding region of"

The 37-residue AFP contains three 11-amino acid repeats that make a stereo-specific fit to the ice lattice along the 〈01–12〉 direction of the {20–21} and equivalent binding planes. When the AFP was shortened to delete two of the three 11-amino acid ice-binding repeats, the resulting 15-residue peptide and its variants were less helical and showed no antifreeze activity. However, when the helicity of the peptide was reinforced by an internal lactam bridge between Glu-7 and Lys-11, the minimized AFP was able to stably express the pyramidal plane {20–21} on the surface of growing ice crystals. This dynamic shaping of the ice surface by a single ice-binding repeat provides evidence that AFP adsorption to the ice lattice is not an “all-or-nothing” interaction. Instead, a partial interaction can help develop the binding site on ice to which the remainder of the AFP (or other AFP molecules) can orient and bind.

Nature. 1988; 333: 232-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Its helicity can be attributed to several structural features, which include an abundance of alanine, an extensive capping network at both termini (3Sicheri F. Yang D.S.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), and an internal salt bridge (1Davies P.L. Hew C.L.

From ice etching studies, it was shown that this AFP binds to the {20–21} hexagonal bipyramidal planes of ice along the 〈01–12〉 direction (5Knight C.A. Cheng C.C. DeVries A.L. Biophys. J. 1991; 64: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (462) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the critical connection between structure and function in this protein is that putative ice-binding residues (Thr, Asx, and Leu) are aligned and regularly spaced along one face of the helix (5Knight C.A. Cheng C.C. DeVries A.L. Biophys. J. 1991; 64: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 6Wen D. Laursen R.A. J. Biol.

Each residue (e.g. Thr-2, Thr-13, Thr-24, and Thr-35) is spaced 11 amino acids apart (16.5 Å), which closely matches the 16.7-Å distance between repeating features of the ridge and valley topology along the 〈01–12〉 direction of the {20–12} binding plane. Adsorption of type I AFP to these lattice binding sites through a precise distance and geometry match involving H-bonding and van der Waals interactions (5Knight C.A. Cheng C.C. DeVries A.L. Biophys.

In the process, seed ice crystals are constrained to form hexagonal bipyramids with a c:a axial ratio of 3.3:1, which matches the ratio predicted from the adsorption planes revealed by ice etching studies (5Knight C.A.

Chem. 1992; 267: 14102-14108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several attempts have been made to model the helix in contact with the ice surface (3Sicheri F. Yang D.S.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 7Wen D Laursen R.A. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1659-1662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 10Madura J.D.

Biol. 1992; 223: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). As a result, a common concern is that the number and strength of the potential interactions between ice and AFP are barely sufficient for tight binding (3Sicheri F. Yang D.S.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 7Wen D Laursen R.A. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1659-1662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). One solution proposed is that all four ice-binding threonines share the same rotamer configuration and bind to ice in a “zipper-like fashion” (11Chou K.-C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). A similar hypothesis, stemming directly from the x-ray structure, is that tight binding relies on the simultaneous docking of similarly aligned and constrained ice-binding side chains that together form a flat ice-binding surface (3Sicheri F. Yang D.S.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). The requirement of side-chain rigidity for tight binding seems to be at odds with the NMR solution structure for type I AFP, which failed to find any evidence that the ice-binding side chains were locked into a specific common rotamer, even at 3 °C (12Gronwald W. Chao H. Reddy D.V. Davies P.L. Sykes B.D. Sönnichsen F.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16698-16704Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). To investigate this, and the related issue of the length of the ice-binding site, we set out to construct a minimized type I AFP that was sufficient for binding to ice. These experiments have shed new light on the mechanism of AFP binding to ice. Antifreeze proteins do not necessarily bind to a preformed site on ice but instead help to shape the site to which they bind. This principle may be of general relevance to mineralization and demineralization processes. All peptides were prepared by solid-phase peptide synthesis using a benzhydrylamine hydrochloride resin on a Labortec SP 640 peptide synthesizer as described previously (13Houston Jr., M.E. Campbell A.P. Lix B. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Hodges R.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10041-10050Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The peptides were cleaved from the resin by reaction with HF (10 ml/g resin) containing 10% anisole for 1 h at −5 °C to 0 °C. The crude peptides were purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography on a SynChropak RP-4 preparative C4 column (250 × 21.2-mm internal diameter, 6.5-μm particle size, 300-Å pore size) (SynChrom, Lafayette, IN) with a linear AB gradient of 0.1% B/min with a flow rate of 5 ml/min, where solvent A is 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in water and solvent B is 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile. For amino acid analysis, peptides were hydrolyzed in 6 n HCl containing 0.1% phenol for 1 h at 160 °C in sealed evacuated tubes. Amino acid analysis was performed on a Beckman model 6300 amino acid analyzer (Beckman, San Ramon, CA). Mass analysis of the peptides was performed on a Fisons VG Quattro triple quadropole mass spectrometer (Manchester, UK) fitted with an electrospray ionization source operating in the positive ion mode. A number of 10-μl injections of the peptide samples (usually in aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid at an approximate concentration of 50 pmol/μl) were made into a carrier solution composed of water/acetonitrile (1:1, v/v) containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid at a rate of 10 μl/min into the electrospray source. The quadropoles were scanned from 600 to 1400 mass over charge ratio at 10 s/scan. Data were acquired in the multi-channel acquisition mode with 10–15 scans typically being summed to produce a spectrum. CD spectra were measured on a Jasco J-500C spectropolarimeter (Jasco, Easton, MD) equipped with a Jasco DP-500N data processor as described previously (14Chao H. Hodges R.S. Kay C.M. Gauthier S.Y. Davies P.L. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1150-1156Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A Lauda water bath (model RMS, Brinkmann Instruments, Rexdale, Ontario, Canada) was used to control the temperature of the cell. CD spectra were the average of four scans obtained by collecting data at 0.1-nm intervals from 255 to 190 nm. The buffer used was 50 mmKH2PO4, 50 mm KCl (pH 7.0). Thermal hysteresis, defined as the temperature difference (°C) between the melting point and the non-equilibrium freezing point of a solution, was measured using a nanoliter osmometer (Clifton Technical Physics, Hartford, NY), as described by Chakrabartty and Hew (4Chakrabartty A. Hew C.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). For the purpose of comparison, an ice crystal growth rate of more than 0.2 μm/s is defined as having reached the solution freezing point (15DeLuca C.I. Chao H. Sönnichsen F.D. Sykes B.D. Davies P.L. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2345-2355Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This operational definition was introduced to standardize thermal hysteresis measurements, when it became apparent that some AFP mutants exhibit slow ice crystal growth prior to a well defined freezing end point, and others grow so rapidly that a distinguishable end point is not observed. All measurements were made in 0.1m NH4HCO3 (pH 7.9) and 0.02% (w/v) sodium azide. Ice crystal morphology was observed through a Leitz Dialux 22 microscope and recorded by a Panasonic CCTV camera linked to a JVC Super VHS video recorder. Still images were obtained from a Silicon Graphics INDY terminal using IRIS Capture version 1.2. For ice growth rate analysis, samples were held at a fixed degree of undercooling and images were captured at 0- and 10-min time points. Type I AFP is an ideal protein for minimization because there are few structural restraints to making it smaller by simply shortening the helix. The initial minimized 15-amino acid AFP structure (15KE in Fig.1) was formed by removing the two central 11-amino acid repeats (residues 13–34 inclusive) and reinstating the internal salt bridge into the remaining repeat on the opposite side of the helix to the threonines. By removing 22 residues (exactly two repeats), the critical 16.5-Å spacing between the remaining two threonines could be maintained, but only if the peptide retained its α-helicity. The latter concern was the key structural restraint in the minimization exercise. By shortening the protein from the center, the helix stabilizing N- and C-cap structures were not disturbed. However, these features, together with the intrachain salt bridge between Lys-7 and Glu-11, were not enough to make the peptide fully helical, even at 1 °C (Fig. 2) (see below).Figure 2CD spectra of wild-type and minimized antifreeze peptides. CD spectra were run in 50 mmKH2PO4, 50 mm KCl (pH 7.0) at 1 °C. Peptides were WT (▵), 15KE (▪), Ac-15KE (□), 15EK (○), and 15EKlac (•).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Two minor adjustments were made in an attempt to increase the stability of the peptide. One was acetylation of the N terminus (peptide Ac-15KE in Fig. 1). Doig et al. (16Doig A.J. Chakrabartty A. Klingler T.M. Baldwin R.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3396-3403Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar) have reported that the unfavorable effect of protonation at the N terminus is approximately 0.5 kcal/mol and that acetylation of the free amino group can improve helix stability. This can be attributed to elimination of the positive charge and possibly to hydrogen bond formation between the acetyl CO and an unsatisfied main chain NH group. The other adjustment was to reverse the order of the ion pair residues Lys-7 and Glu-11 to Glu-7 and Lys-11 (peptide EK15 in Fig.1) in order to orient the salt bridge more favorably with the helix macrodipole (17Huyghues-Despointes B.M. Scholtz J.M. Baldwin R.L. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 80-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 18Marqusee S. Baldwin R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8898-8902Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar). Previously it has been shown that incorporation of a lactam bridge between Glu and Lys spaced four residues apart dramatically increased the helical content of small amphipathic peptides relative to their uncyclized linear peptides bearing the same sequence (13Houston Jr., M.E. Campbell A.P. Lix B. Kay C.M. Sykes B.D. Hodges R.S. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 10041-10050Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The modified peptide 15EK was ideally suited for lactam bridge synthesis because of the orientation of the ion pair, Glu-7 and Lys-11. Thus, the third modification of the prototypical minimized type I AFP (15EK) was the formation of a Glu-7 to Lys-11 i,i+4 lactam bond in place of the salt bridge. It was thought that this covalent link might be the most effective way of maintaining the correct 16.5-Å spacing between the two remaining threonines. The CD spectra of type I AFP (WT) and minimized AFPs in benign conditions at 1 °C are shown in Fig. 2. The CD spectra of the wild-type protein are characteristic of a highly helical molecule with minima at 222 and 208 and a maximum at 192 nm. Typically, the molar ellipticity at 222 nm ([θ]222)has been used to measure the helical content in peptides (19Chen Y.-H. Yang J.T. Chau K.H. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 3350-3359Crossref PubMed Scopus (1963) Google Scholar). For the wild-type protein, this has been previously reported to be −36,100 deg·cm2·dmol−1 at 1 °C (6Wen D. Laursen R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14102-14108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All minimized peptides displayed significantly less α-helical character than the full-length AFP. However, it is unlikely that a peptide of 15 residues in length would be as helical or as stable as a 37-residue protein due to the length dependence of the [θ]222signal. For the minimized peptides stabilized by a salt bridge, the CD spectra resemble a mixture of helical and random conformations. The CD spectra of 15KE and 15EK are nearly superimposable, and their [θ]222 values at 1 °C are quite similar (−19,450 deg·cm2·dmol−1 and −18100 deg·cm2·dmol−1), yielding estimates for helical content of 62% and 58%, respectively. However, acetylation of the N terminus resulted in a lower helical content (42%), as measured by the 222-nm signal. This may be due to acetylation disrupting the N-cap. All three peptides were essentially 100% helical in the presence of 50% TFE (data not shown). Introduction of a lactam bridge in place of the salt bridge greatly increased the helical content of the peptide to 90% ([θ]222 = −28,100 deg·cm2·dmol−1). This is the only minimized peptide for which the CD spectrum is similar to that of the wild-type protein with a minimum at 222 nm that exceeds the value at 208 nm, suggesting the peptide adopts an α-helical conformation. Once again, this peptide was highly helical in 50% TFE (data not shown). Thermal denaturation profiles of all minimized AFP peptides are shown in Fig. 3. For the peptides stabilized by salt bridges, the [θ]222 signal sharply declined and leveled off at −7000 deg·cm2·dmol−1. The denaturation profile of EK-lac was somewhat broader, indicating a less cooperative transition. Approximately 50% of the helicity observed at 1 °C was lost at 52 °C. (In contrast, the wild-type protein had aT m of 22 °C.) This stability has been observed previously for other constrained peptides and has been attributed to residues within the covalent constraint being unable to fully denature. All peptides were assayed for thermal hysteresis activity using a nanoliter osmometer (4Chakrabartty A. Hew C.L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 202: 1057-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), which also provided an opportunity to check for interactions between protein and ice, as revealed by the shaping of ice crystals. None of the minimized peptides was able to depress the freezing point below the melting point at concentrations of 50–100 mg/ml (∼50 mm). Even the slightest undercooling caused the seed ice crystal to grow steadily. In the presence of 15KE and 15EK, the ice crystal took the shape of a rounded disk indistinguishable from that formed in the presence of buffer alone (Fig.4 A, panels b andd). With Ac-15KE, there was a hint of a hexagonal shape to the disk, suggestive of peptide binding to the ice (Fig. 4 A,panel c). In contrast, 15EKlac was very active in shaping the ice into an incomplete hexagonal bipyramid, which generally lacked one or both apices (Fig. 4 A, panels e andf). When the c:a axis ratio was measured by extrapolation from 10 representative crystals, it ranged from 3.5:1 to 3.1:1, with an average value of 3.3. This average value is precisely that obtained with full-length, wild-type AFP (6Wen D. Laursen R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 14102-14108Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15DeLuca C.I. Chao H. Sönnichsen F.D. Sykes B.D. Davies P.L. Biophys. J. 1996; 71: 2345-2355Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which is the ratio predicted for expression of the {20–21} pyramidal planes. This value was maintained even as the ice crystal grew considerably over a time course of 1–10 min, indicating a persistent influence of the peptide over the ice surfaces expressed. In one sequence of time-lapse video microscopy (Fig. 4 B), the ratio varied from 3.4 at 1 min to 3.3 at 5 and 10 min, during which time the volume of the crystal increased manyfold. In another series (data not shown), the ratio was 3.20 at 1 min and 3.17 at 10 min. Thus, a single ice-binding repeat that was constrained to be α-helical was sufficient to define the {20–21} pyramidal plane but could not prevent ice-crystal growth. The fact that 15EKlac generated a faceted ice crystal without causing non-colligative depression of the freezing point could be explained by transient (reversible) binding of the peptide to the ice surface. The high helical content of wild-type AFP is thought to reflect the importance of maintaining the polypeptide backbone in this conformation, such that the spacing of the threonines and other ice-binding residues matches the ice lattice (3Sicheri F. Yang D.S.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 427-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 5Knight C.A. Cheng C.C. DeVries A.L. Biophys. J. 1991; 64: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 7Wen D Laursen R.A. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 1659-1662Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar, 11Chou K.-C. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 509-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Although all the minimized AFP peptides that were stabilized by a salt bridge contained a certain amount of helical structure as determined by CD, their helical content was substantially less than that of the wild-type protein or of that induced in 50% TFE. The overall conformation of these peptide is most likely an ensemble where sections of the peptide adopt fully helical, partly helical, and random conformations. This is consistent with the findings of Merutka et al. (20Merutka G. Morikis D. Brushweiler R. Wright P.E. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 13089-13097Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), where a small peptide that was even more helical than the 15-mers in Fig. 1 (as determined by CD) contained a significant population of non-helical conformers (as determined by NMR). For the lactam-bridged peptide, the internal lactam bridge biases the peptide to adopt a more helical structure. This, in turn, should lower the change in conformational entropy between peptides bound to ice and those free in solution. For the non-lactam-bridged peptides, it is likely that the free energy of binding to ice is insufficient to compensate for the loss of conformational entropy upon immobilization of the peptide backbone into a fully helical conformation. The significance of the interaction between the minimized, lactam-bridged type I AFP and ice lies in the insight it provides about the adsorption phase of the adsorption-inhibition mechanism of action of AFPs. This insight helps resolve two paradoxes. One is that AFPs bind to planes of ice that are not extensively expressed in the absence of the antifreeze. The other is that the Thr residues of type I AFP are rarely optimally configured for immediate binding to ice because of side chain rotation (12Gronwald W. Chao H. Reddy D.V. Davies P.L. Sykes B.D. Sönnichsen F.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16698-16704Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). A solution to these paradoxes is illustrated for type I AFP by the model shown in Fig.5. In the absence of AFP, an ice crystal will typically grow as a rounded disk (Fig. 5 A) as water molecules add to the prism surfaces (a-axial growth) in preference to the two basal planes (c-axial growth). The crystal surface may appear microscopically smooth but will be uneven at the submicroscopic to atomic level on all but the basal planes. The irregular addition of water to a prism surface of the ice lattice creates a small section of the pyramidal plane {20–21} (Fig.5 B). This section, involving just five layers of water, already expresses the characteristic surface properties of the AFP's adsorption plane, including the 16.7-Å spacing along the 〈01–12〉 direction, and is sufficient to initiate antifreeze binding. It is clear from solution NMR studies that all four threonines in type I AFP are free to occupy different rotamer configurations, although the middle two have a preference for −60 °C 55% of the time (12Gronwald W. Chao H. Reddy D.V. Davies P.L. Sykes B.D. Sönnichsen F.D. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 16698-16704Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Although the chances of all four threonines being in the same orientation at any one instant is quite small, the evidence from minimized AFP binding to ice shows that this is a not a precondition for initial contact, because dynamic ice shaping occurs with a single repeat. It is quite likely, therefore, that two neighboring threonines (especially the middle two) will be found with the same rotamer configuration. A single ice-binding repeat would then be the smallest unit of the AFP that theoretically could define both the plane and direction of AFP binding to ice. That it does this in practice is demonstrated by the shaping of ice crystals by 15EKlac into truncated hexagonal bipyramids with the 3.3:1 c:a axis ratio typical of full-length type I AFP. Thus, it is not necessary for all four threonines to touch down on the ice surface to secure that plane for binding. The model suggested by these studies is that type I AFP binding to ice is unlikely to be an “all-or-nothing” event. Instead, it is best described by an induced-fit mechanism, where touchdown by any twoi,i+11 threonines with the same rotamer configuration (representing a single ice binding repeat) is sufficient to stabilize the smallest facet of ice that will bind repetitively. Even transient occupancy of this ice surface would allow ice to advance relative to the occupied region, particularly by water addition to the prism surfaces (Fig. 5, B and C). If, during this period, the advance is sufficient to engage a third threonine (representing a second ice-binding repeat), which might have had to rotate its side chain to provide the 16.5-Å spacing, then the binding would be stronger. Should dissociation have occurred prior to the engagement of the second repeat, the net effect would have been to shape the ice closer to the {20–21} plane, thereby making it easier for another type I AFP molecule to engage. Either through a dissociation-reassociation process or by side-chain reorganization while on the ice surface, the eventual outcome is that all repeats would make contact (Fig. 5 C). At this point, binding would be virtually irreversible because dissociation would require the simultaneous breaking of all the AFP-ice interactions. This shaping of the ice surface, coupled with selection for AFPs with ideal rotamers, is a dynamic, synergistic process where an improved binding site leads to more efficient binding, which further improves the binding site. Although type I AFP may be unusual in having somewhat flexible ice-binding residues, ice-site shaping by an induced-fit mechanism is a principle that could apply to other AFPs.

We have previously shown that the endothelial-specific in vivo activity of the human ICAM-2 promoter is contained within a small (0.33-kilobase (kbp)) 5′-flanking region of the gene. Here we describe the in vitrocharacterization of this region. The ICAM-2 promoter is TATA-less, and transcription in endothelial cells initiates at four sites. Reporter gene expression directed by the promoter was 125-fold greater than vector alone in bovine aortic endothelial cells but less than 2-fold vector alone in non-endothelial (COS) cells, confirming that specificity in vivo was paralleled in vitro. The addition of 2.7 kbp of 5′-flanking region to the 0.33-kbp fragment had no effect on promoter activity or specificity. The mutation of an Sp1 motif centered at base pair −194 or an eight-base pair palindrome at −268 each reduced promoter activity by 70%. Mutation of GATA motifs at −145 and −53 reduced promoter activity by 78 and 61%, respectively. Specific binding of bovine aortic endothelial cells nuclear proteins to the Sp1 and GATA sites was demonstrated by gel shift analysis. Promoter activity in COS cells was transactivated 3–4-fold by overexpression of GATA-2.

The endothelial cells that form the lining of all blood vessels perform a wide range of functions. In addition to providing a selective barrier between the bloodstream and tissues, vascular endothelial cells are critical for processes including thrombosis, angiogenesis, leukocyte trafficking, and the maintenance of vascular tone (1Risau W. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 926-933Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). The vascular endothelium also plays an important role in cancer metastasis and in the pathogenesis of non-neoplastic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis (2Folkman J. Nat.

The promoters of several genes that are expressed predominantly or exclusively in endothelial cells have been examined both in vitro in transient transfection assays and in vivo in transgenic mouse studies. The human and mouse tie1 promoters demonstrated endothelial cell specificity in vivo, with expression in the vasculature varying from organ to organ but surprisingly were not specific in vitro (7Korhonen J.

In contrast, the human KDR/flk-1 and von Willebrand factor promoters were endothelial cell-specific in vitro, but their activityin vivo was undetectable (18Patterson C. Wu Y. Lee M.-E. DeVault J.D.

Unlike these promoters, which presumably lack important regulatory elements, the mousetie2 (tek) promoter/enhancer was capable of driving endothelial cell-specific transgene expression in vitro and in vivo (4Schlaeger T.M.

Human ICAM-2 is a counter receptor for lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (21Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Nature. 1989; 339: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) and may provide a costimulatory signal for T cell stimulation by allogeneic class II major histocompatibility complex (22Carpenito C. Pyszniak A.M. Takei F. Scand. J. Immunol. 1997; 45: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In human tissues, the expression of ICAM-2 is restricted largely to endothelial cells and megakaryocytes (23de Fougerolles A.R. Stacker S.A. Schwarting R. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 253-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Unlike the mouse tie2promoter/enhancer, which comprises 2.1 kbp of promoter and 10 kbp of the first intron (4Schlaeger T.M. Bartunkova S. Lawitts J.A. Teichmann G. Risau W. Deutsch U. Sato T.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3058-3063Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar), the human ICAM-2 promoter contains all of the signals necessary for endothelium-specific transgene expressionin vivo within a relatively small (<350 bp) region, presenting a novel opportunity for analysis. In this study, we report the first in vitro characterization of the ICAM-2 promoter. We demonstrate that the ICAM-2 promoter is endothelial cell-specificin vitro and identify four elements, an Sp1 site, two GATA sites, and an 8-bp palindromic sequence also present in thetie2 enhancer, that are necessary for full promoter activity. We also show that the ICAM-2 promoter is transactivated in non-endothelial cells by overexpression of two members of the GATA family of transcription factors, GATA-1 and GATA-2. Plasmid DNA was prepared from bacterial cultures using Qiagen Plasmid Midi or Maxi Kits. DNA sequencing reactions were performed using Thermo Sequenase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). T3 and T7 primers were used to sequence inserts cloned into pBluescript II (Stratagene), and the primers GL3–1 and GL3–2 (corresponding to bp 51–68 and to the complement of bp 4785–4803, respectively, in the vector) were used for inserts cloned into pGL3-Basic (Promega). Reactions were electrophoresed at either the Nucleotide Sequencing Facility, Monash University, Victoria, or the Molecular Biology Facility, Griffith University, Queensland, Australia. The DNA sequence was scanned for putative transcription factor binding sites using the MatInspector program (24Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2427) Google Scholar) and the TRANSFAC data base (25Wingender E. Kel A.E. Kel O.V. Karas H. Heinemeyer T. Dietze P. Knueppel R. Romaschenko A.G. Kolchanov N.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). Comparison of ICAM-2 sequences was carried out using the Clustal W program (26Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56003) Google Scholar). The Human GenomeWalker kit (CLONTECH) was used to walk upstream of known ICAM-2 5′-flanking sequence. A primer complementary to the sequence +27/+50 relative to the ICAM-2 translation start site (21Staunton D.E. Dustin M.L. Springer T.A. Nature. 1989; 339: 61-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar) was used with an outer adaptor primer in primary PCRs using five adaptor-ligated human genomic libraries as templates. Samples of the primary PCRs were used in secondary PCRs with a nested ICAM-2-specific primer (−17/+5 relative to the translation start site) and a nested adaptor primer. Products of the secondary PCRs were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis, purified using the QIAquick Gel extraction kit (Qiagen), and cloned into pBluescript II. The 5′ end of the 0.33-kbp ICAM-2 promoter fragment in an ICAM-2 promoter/human CD59 microinjection construct (20Cowan P.J. Shinkel T.A. Witort E.J. Barlow H. Pearse M.J. d'Apice A.J.F. Transplantation. 1996; 62: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) is delineated by an NcoI site. This site was employed in the precise fusion of 2.7 kbp of upstream flanking sequence (isolated as described above) to the 0.33-kbp region. The resulting construct, designated PK, was used to generate transgenic mice as described (20Cowan P.J. Shinkel T.A. Witort E.J. Barlow H. Pearse M.J. d'Apice A.J.F. Transplantation. 1996; 62: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Peripheral blood leukocytes from the transgenic mice were examined for the expression of CD59 by flow cytometric analysis as described (20Cowan P.J. Shinkel T.A. Witort E.J. Barlow H. Pearse M.J. d'Apice A.J.F. Transplantation. 1996; 62: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Fresh frozen tissue sections prepared from mouse organs were stained to detect the pattern of CD59 expression as described (20Cowan P.J. Shinkel T.A. Witort E.J. Barlow H. Pearse M.J. d'Apice A.J.F. Transplantation. 1996; 62: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The method used to identify the 5′ end of ICAM-2 transcripts was based on the 5′ RACE system (Life Technologies, Inc.). In brief, total RNA (2.5 μg) prepared from human umbilical vein endothelial cells was reverse-transcribed from an antisense primer (+27/+50 relative to the ICAM-2 translation start site) using SuperScript II (Life Technologies). The cDNA was purified and tailed with dCTP using terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (Promega). An aliquot of the tailed cDNA was used as template in a PCR with primers AAP (5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACGGGIIGGGIIGGGIIG-3′) and a nested antisense primer (−17/+5 relative to the ICAM-2 translation start site) using the Advantage Tth polymerase mix (CLONTECH) to maximize fidelity. PCR was carried out in a DNA engine thermal cycler (MJ Research) using the following parameters: 94 °C for 2 min; 5 cycles of 92 °C/10 s, 55 °C/10 s, 72 °C/30 s; and 25 cycles of 92 °C/5 s, 55 °C/5 s, 72 °C/30 s. An aliquot (0.1%) of the first PCR was used directly in a second PCR with primers AUAP (5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTAC-3′) and the nested antisense (−17/+5) primer under the same conditions except that the annealing temperature was increased to 60 °C. Products of the second PCR were purified using the High Pure PCR product purification kit (Boehringer Mannheim) and cloned into pBluescript II. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) were isolated using a modification of a previously described procedure (27Booyse F.M. Sedlak B.J. Rafelson Jr., M.E. Thromb. Diath. Haemorrh. 1975; 34: 825-839PubMed Google Scholar). Freshly isolated bovine aortae were ligated, rinsed 3–5 times with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, and filled with growth medium (see below) lacking fetal calf serum and containing 1 mg/ml collagenase (Boehringer Mannheim). After a 10–15-min incubation in 5% CO2 at 37 °C, the contents of the aortae were removed and centrifuged at 1500 × gfor 10 min. The cell pellet was resuspended in growth medium consisting of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies) supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Life Technologies), 15 mm HEPES (Trace Scientific, Australia), 60 μg/ml penicillin (CSL, Australia), 100 μg/ml streptomycin (CSL), and 20 μg/ml cis-4-hydroxy-l-proline (Sigma) and dispensed into gelatin-coated flasks. BAEC were used at passage 3–8. COS-7 (African green monkey fibroblast) cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and cultured in the same medium as used for BAEC except that the concentration of heat-inactivated fetal calf serum was 10%, and no cis-hydroxyproline was added. Transient transfections were performed at least twice, in triplicate. For transfection of BAEC, approximately 105 cells were plated/well in 6-well trays and incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C until 40–50% confluent (16–20 h). For each well, 4 μl of LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies) and 1.5 μg of plasmid DNA (1 μg of luciferase construct plus 0.5 μg of pSVβGal (Promega) were preincubated separately in 100 μl of Opti-MEM I (Life Technologies) for 45 min at room temperature, mixed together with 800 μl Opti-MEM I, and used to overlay the cells. After a 5-h incubation at 37 °C, the overlay was replaced with 2 ml of growth medium, and the cells were incubated for a further 64–72 h before harvesting and analysis. COS cells were transfected similarly except that 2 × 105cells were plated/well, 6 μl of LipofectAMINE was used, and the cells were harvested after a 40–48 h incubation. For transactivation experiments, the transfected DNA comprised 0.9 μg of luciferase construct, 0.2 μg of M6α-SEAP, 0.2 μg of pSVβGal, and 0.2 μg of either pXM-mGATA-1 (28Tsai S. Martin D.I.K. Zon L.I. D'Andrea A.D. Wong G.G. Orkin S.H. Nature. 1989; 339: 448-451Crossref Scopus (667) Google Scholar), pMT2-hGATA-2 (29Dorfman D.M. Wilson D.B. Bruns G.A.P. Orkin S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 1279-1285Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), or the vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen). M6α-SEAP was constructed by cloning the GATA-responsive M6α promoter from an M6α-hGH plasmid (Ref. 30Yamamoto M. Ko L.J. Leonard M.W. Beug H. Orkin S.H. Engel J.D. Genes Dev. 1990; 2: 1089-1100Google Scholar; kindly provided by Dr Merlin Crossley, Biochemistry Department, University of Sydney, NSW, Australia) into the secreted alkaline phosphatase reporter plasmid pSEAP2-Basic (CLONTECH). pXM-mGATA-1, which contains the adenovirus major late promoter driving the expression of murine GATA-1, and pMT2-hGATA-2, which contains the same promoter driving the expression of human GATA-2, were also provided by Dr. Merlin Crossley. Luciferase and β-galactosidase activities in lysates of transfected cells were measured using the luciferase assay system (Promega) and the chemiluminescent β-Gal reporter gene assay kit (Boehringer Mannheim), respectively. Secreted alkaline phosphatase activity in the culture medium of transfected cells was measured using the Great EscAPe SEAP chemiluminescence detection kit (CLONTECH). Light intensity was measured using a MicroLumat LB96P plate luminometer (EG and G Berthold). The protein concentration of lysates was determined using the DC protein assay kit (Bio-Rad) and bovine serum albumin as the standard. Enzyme activities were corrected for background by subtracting the values obtained for mock-transfected cells. A two-step PCR method was used to mutagenize the 0.33-kbp ICAM-2 promoter cloned in pBluescript II such that the 5′ end is closest to the M13 forward priming site (20Cowan P.J. Shinkel T.A. Witort E.J. Barlow H. Pearse M.J. d'Apice A.J.F. Transplantation. 1996; 62: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In the first step, PCRs were carried out using an internal mutagenic primer with an external vector-targeted primer. The internal forward primers (mutated bases underlined) were P8-Fmut, 5′-TTCCCCAGACGCGGGGCTTGT-3′; P12-Fmut, 5′-GTCTCATATTCGCATGCGAACACCCATTG-3′; Sp1-Fmut, 5′-CATTGCCTGCCCTATCCCTTGCACA-3′; GATA U-Fmut, 5′-GCCCTGCTTTAGAGCAGCTTC-3′; and GATA D-Fmut, 5′-CTCTCAGTATATGAGAGGA-3′. The internal reverse primers (P8-Rmut, etc.) were complementary to the forward primers. The forward and reverse primers were used in independent PCRs with the M13/pUC reverse and forward amplification primers (Life Technologies), respectively. The two products from each set of first-step PCRs (e.g., P8-Fmut/M13-R and P8-Rmut/M13-F) were purified, mixed, and used in the second-step PCR with the external primers only. Products from the second-step PCRs were cloned into pGL3-Basic and sequenced to confirm the presence of the desired mutations. To construct the Sp1/GATA U (upstream) double mutant, the upstream GATA site mutant cloned in pGL3-Basic was used as template. The mutagenic primers were Sp1-Fmut and Sp1-Rmut, and the external primers were GL3–1 and GL3–2. The second-step PCR product was cloned and sequenced as described above. BAEC nuclear extracts were prepared as follows. A confluent monolayer of cells in a 25 cm2 flask were harvested by scraping, washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline (pH 8.0), and resuspended in 50 μl of cold Buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 2 mmMgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 10% glycerol, and 1 mm EDTA). 50 μl of cold Buffer B (Buffer A plus 1% Nonidet P-40) was added, and the cells were allowed to swell on ice for 15 min then vortexed vigorously. The resulting lysate was centrifuged at 700 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The nuclear pellet was resuspended in 0.5 ml of Buffer A plus 0.5 ml of Buffer B and recentrifuged at 700 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of cold Buffer C (20 mmHEPES, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm EGTA), and nuclear proteins were extracted by vigorous shaking for 30 min at 4 °C. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 18,000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C, and the nuclear extract was aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70 °C. Buffers A, B, and C were adjusted to 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin before use. The binding mixture (20 μl) contained ∼15 μg of BAEC nuclear extract, 0.5 μg poly(dI:dC), and 105 cpm of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide probe in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm bovine serum albumin. All of the ingredients except the probe were mixed and incubated for 15 min at room temperature, after which the probe was added, and incubation was continued for 15–30 min. Band shifts were resolved by electrophoresis at 4 °C on a non-denaturing 7% polyacrylamide gel. The probes were as follows (coordinates relative to the primary transcription start site): Sp1, bp −207 to −183; GATA U (upstream), bp −155 to −135; and GATA D (downstream), bp −61 to −43. Competition studies were performed by adding a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides to the binding reactions before the addition of labeled probe. DNA-protein-complexes were judged to be specific if their formation was competitively inhibited by cold unlabeled probe but not by an unrelated oligonucleotide. Mutant competitors (Sp1-Fmut/Sp1-Rmut etc.) are described in the previous section. Human ICAM-2 expression in the tissues is restricted largely to vascular endothelial cells and megakaryocytes (23de Fougerolles A.R. Stacker S.A. Schwarting R. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 253-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar); in the blood, ICAM-2 is expressed on platelets (31Diacovo T.G. de Fougerolles A.R. Bainton D.F. Springer T.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1994; 94: 1243-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and at a low level on resting lymphocytes and monocytes but not on granulocytes (23de Fougerolles A.R. Stacker S.A. Schwarting R. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 253-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). We have previously shown that 0.33 kbp of 5′-flanking region of the human ICAM-2 gene is sufficient to target high-level transgene expression to all vascular endothelium in the heart, kidney, liver, lung, and pancreas of transgenic mice (20Cowan P.J. Shinkel T.A. Witort E.J. Barlow H. Pearse M.J. d'Apice A.J.F. Transplantation. 1996; 62: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), consistent with the tissue distribution of human ICAM-2. Unexpectedly, however, transgenic mouse lymphocytes were negative for transgene expression and granulocytes were very strongly positive. This discrepancy is unlikely to be due to differences in the pattern of expression of human and mouse ICAM-2, because flow cytometric analysis revealed that the hierarchy of ICAM-2 expression levels is similar on human and mouse leukocyte populationsi.e. monocytes > lymphocytes ≫ granulocytes. 2P. J. Cowan, unpublished results. An alternative explanation is that elements regulating ICAM-2 expression on leukocytes are absent from the 0.33-kbp region. To investigate this possibility and to generate additional material for in vitro analysis of the ICAM-2 promoter, a larger 5′-flanking region of human ICAM-2 was isolated. Nested primers targeted to known ICAM-2 promoter sequence were used with adaptor primers to amplify the 5′-flanking sequence from five adaptor-ligated human genomic libraries. The PvuII,SspI, and ScaI libraries yielded products of 1.0, 1.8, and 3.1 kbp, respectively, which were cloned and analyzed by restriction enzyme digestion to produce the map shown in Fig.1 A. The DNA sequence obtained from the 3′ end of the two larger clones matched that of the 0.33-kbp region (20Cowan P.J. Shinkel T.A. Witort E.J. Barlow H. Pearse M.J. d'Apice A.J.F. Transplantation. 1996; 62: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) except for an additional G at bp −281 and an additional C at bp −275 (Fig. 1 B). The presence of these bases, confirmed in the original 0.33-kbp clone by re-sequencing, revealed a consensus NF-κB motif (GGGGTTCCCC) at bp −281 to bp −272 (Fig.1 B). Transgenic mice were generated using a construct (termed PK) in which 3 kbp of human ICAM-2 5′-flanking region was used to drive the expression of human CD59. Flow cytometric analysis of leukocytes from 11 PK transgenic mice revealed an identical pattern of transgene expression to that driven by the 0.33-kbp fragment (20Cowan P.J. Shinkel T.A. Witort E.J. Barlow H. Pearse M.J. d'Apice A.J.F. Transplantation. 1996; 62: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), i.e. very strong (>40-fold human level) expression on granulocytes (Fig.2) and little or no expression on lymphocytes (data not shown). This suggests that the postulated missing leukocyte-specific regulatory elements, assuming they exist, are not located within the 3 kbp of 5′-flanking region of ICAM-2 used in the generation of PK transgenic mice. To compare the level and pattern of transgene expression in tissues driven either by the small (0.33 kbp) or large (3 kbp) ICAM-2 promoter fragment, organs from the original line of transgenic mice (20Cowan P.J. Shinkel T.A. Witort E.J. Barlow H. Pearse M.J. d'Apice A.J.F. Transplantation. 1996; 62: 155-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and from one of the PK lines were examined by immunocytochemistry. An identical pattern of staining was observed in both lines, with strong transgene expression restricted to all vascular endothelium in the heart, kidney, liver, lung, and pancreas. Representative sections of heart and kidney from transgenic and control mice, stained to detect CD59 expression, are shown in Fig.3.Figure 3In vivo promoter activity of 0.33 kbp or 3.0 kbp of ICAM-2 5′-flanking region. Fresh frozen sections (4 μm) of mouse tissues were stained to detect the expression of human CD59. a and d, kidney and heart of non-transgenic mouse. b and e, kidney and heart of mouse from transgenic line 237-7 (20Cowan P.J.

Magnification × 50.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To identify the transcription start site(s) of the human ICAM-2 gene, 5′-RACE was performed on total RNA from human umbilical vein endothelial cells, which strongly express ICAM-2 (23de Fougerolles A.R. Stacker S.A. Schwarting R. Springer T.A. J. Exp. Med. 1991; 174: 253-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). First-strand cDNA prepared using a primer targeted to the first exon was tailed with dC and used in PCR with a G-rich primer and a gene-specific nested primer. After a second PCR with nested primers, the resulting products were cloned into pBluescript II, and five clones were sequenced, revealing four transcription start sites (Fig. 1 B). A thymine residue (shown in bold type) located 77 bp upstream of the ICAM-2 start codon was designated the primary transcription initiation site (+1), because the start sites for two independent clones mapped to this point and that for a third mapped immediately upstream (−1). The remaining start sites were located at −37 and −66. Thus like the promoters of several other constitutively expressed cell adhesion molecule genes including PECAM-1 (32Gumina R.J. Kirschbaum N.E. Piotrowski K. Newman P.J. Blood. 1997; 89: 1260-1269Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and CD18 (33Agura E.D. Howard M. Collins S.J. Blood. 1992; 79: 602-609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the ICAM-2 promoter lacks consensus TATA and CAAT boxes and contains multiple transcription start sites. The in vitro promoter activity and specificity of various lengths of ICAM-2 5′-flanking region were tested by transfecting different fragments cloned in the luciferase reporter vector pGL3-Basic into BAEC or the simian kidney fibroblast cell line COS. The constructs were cotr"
https://openalex.org/W1966150568,"A major mechanism by which protein kinase C (PKC) function is regulated is through the selective targeting and activation of individual PKC isotypes at distinct subcellular locations. PKC betaII is selectively activated at the nucleus during G2 phase of cell cycle where it is required for entry into mitosis. Selective nuclear activation of PKC betaII is conferred by molecular determinants within the carboxyl-terminal catalytic domain of the kinase (Walker, S. D., Murray, N. R., Burns, D. J., and Fields, A. P. (1995) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 92, 9156-9160). We previously described a lipid-like PKC activator in nuclear membranes, termed nuclear membrane activation factor (NMAF), that potently stimulates PKC betaII activity through interactions involving this domain (Murray, N. R., Burns, D. J., and Fields, A. P. (1994) J. Biol. Chem. 269, 21385-21390). We have now identified NMAF as phosphatidylglycerol (PG), based on several lines of evidence. First, NMAF cofractionates with PG as a single peak of activity through multiple chromatographic separations and exhibits phospholipase sensitivity identical to that of PG. Second, purified PG, but not other phospholipids, exhibits dose-dependent NMAF activity. Third, defined molecular species of PG exhibit different abilities to stimulate PKC betaII activity. 1,2-Dioleoyl-PG possesses significantly higher activity than other PG species, suggesting that both fatty acid side chain composition and the glycerol head group are important determinants for activity. Fourth, in vitro binding studies demonstrate that PG binds to the carboxyl-terminal region of PKC betaII, the same region we previously implicated in NMAF-mediated activation of PKC betaII. Taken together, our results indicate that specific molecular species of nuclear PG function to physiologically regulate PKC betaII activity at the nucleus."

The Escherichia coli K5 capsule consists of a repeat structure of -4)GlcA-β(1,4)-GlcNAc α(1-, identical toN-acetylheparosan. A 60-kDa protein, KfiC, has been identified as a bifunctional glycosyltransferase, responsible for the alternating α and β addition of each UDP-sugar to the nonreducing end of the polysaccharide chain. Using hydrophobic cluster analysis, a conserved secondary structure motif characteristic of β-glycosyltransferases was identified along with two highly conserved aspartic acid residues at positions 301 and 352 within the KfiC protein. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to identify catalytically active amino acids within domain A of the KfiC protein. The conserved aspartic acid residues at 301 and 352 were shown to be critical for the β addition of UDP-GlcA (uridine diphosphoglucuronic acid) to defined nonreducing end oligosaccharide acceptors, suggesting that these conserved aspartic acid residues are catalytically important for β-glycosyltransferase activity. A deleted derivative of thekfiC gene was generated, which encoded for a truncated KfiC (kfiC′) protein. This protein lacked 139 amino acids at the C terminus. This enzyme had no UDP-GlcA transferase activity but still retained UDP-GlcNAc transferase activity, indicating that two separate active sites are present within the KfiC protein.

CAB International Press, Oxford1994: 285-333Google Scholar), have been studied the most (8Roberts I.S. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 2023-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 9Roberts I.S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 285-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The group II K antigen gene cluster consists of three functional regions termed 1, 2, and 3 (Fig. 1) (8Roberts I.S. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 2023-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Regions 1 and 3 are conserved between different group II antigen gene clusters and encode eight proteins responsible for the transport of the polysaccharide from its site of synthesis in the cytoplasm onto the cell surface (see Fig. 1) (10Bronner D. Sieberth V. Pazzani C. Roberts I.S. Boulnois G.J. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5984-5992Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bronner D. Sieberth V. Pazzani C. Smith A. Boulnois G. FEMS Microbiol.

The central region 2 is serotype-specific and encodes proteins that are involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis (9Roberts I.S. Annu. Rev.

In the case of the K5 antigen, a polymer of -4)GlcA-β(1,4)-GlcNAc α(1- 1The abbreviations used are: -4)GlcA-β(1,4)-GlcNAc α(1-, a polymer of alternating glucuronic acid and N-acetylglucosamine residues linked by α1,4 and β1,4 glycosidic bonds; UDP-GlcA, uridine diphosphoglucuronic acid; HCA, hydrophobic cluster analysis; IPTG, isopropyl-1- thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. (13Vann W.F. Schmidt M.A. Hann B. Jann K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1981; 116: 359-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), region 2 encodes four proteins, KfiA through D (Fig. 1). (14Petit C. Rigg G. Pazzani C. Smith A. Sieberth V. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) The functions of the KfiA and B proteins are not known except that they are known to be essential for K5 antigen synthesis, and it is possible that they play roles in the initiation of K5 polysaccharide biosynthesis (9Roberts I.S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 285-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). The KfiD protein is a UDP-Glc dehydrogenase that catalyzes the formation of UDP-GlcA, a component sugar of the K5 polymer (14Petit C. Rigg G. Pazzani C. Smith A. Sieberth V. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 15Sieberth V. Rigg G. Roberts I. Jann K. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4562-4565Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The KfiC protein is the bifunctional glycosyltransferase that is believed to be responsible for the sequential addition of GlcA and GlcNAc from UDP-sugar precursors to the nonreducing end of the growing K5 polysaccharide chain (14Petit C. Rigg G. Pazzani C. Smith A. Sieberth V. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of the K5 polysaccharide and the subsequent transport of the newly synthesized polysaccharide out of the cytoplasm involves a biosynthetic complex consisting of up to ten proteins associated with the inner face of the E. coli inner-membrane (8Roberts I.S. Microbiology. 1995; 141: 2023-2031Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 9Roberts I.S. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1996; 50: 285-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). Glycosyltransferases responsible for the addition of UDP-sugars to the growing polysaccharide chain by the formation of an α (16Geremia R.A. Petroni E.A. Ielpi L. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) or β bond (17Saxena I.M. Brown Jr., R.M. Fevre M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Keenleyside W.J. Whitfield C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28581-28592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) have been studied from a wide variety of systems. Hydrophobic cluster analysis (HCA) of processive β-glycosyltransferases that add sugars to the reducing end of the growing polysaccharide chain identified two domains A and B (17Saxena I.M. Brown Jr., R.M. Fevre M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Domain A consists of four alternating β-strands separated by three α helices (Fig. 2). Two conserved aspartic acid residues were identified in the C-terminal loops of the β2- and β4-strands within domain A (Fig. 2, Table I) and it has been suggested that these might be the catalytic amino acids for the nucleophilic substitution reaction involved in β bond formation (17Saxena I.M. Brown Jr., R.M. Fevre M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The secondary structure prediction for domain B is more difficult to interpret, although a conserved aspartic acid residue and the motif QXXRW were identified (Fig. 2) (17Saxena I.M. Brown Jr., R.M. Fevre M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Nonprocessive β-glycosyltransferases that add a sugar molecule to the nonreducing end of the polysaccharide chain lack domain B, suggesting that this domain is important for processivity. Similar studies on bacterial α-mannosyltransferases identified a region of approximatley 270 amino acids that could be aligned in these enzymes. Two glutamic acid residues were conserved in this region, and it is likely that these are the catalytic amino acids for the two-step process involved in the retaining mechanism of a bond formation (16Geremia R.A. Petroni E.A. Ielpi L. Henrissat B. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 133-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar).Table IPrimary amino acid sequence of the HCA predicted conserved domain A in β-glycosyltransferasesGeneOrganismSequenceKfiCE. coli295.EILVCDD CSSDKSLEI … NFITFQ D ADDLSHPE.360HasAStreptococcus pyogenes58..EIYIVDDGSSNTDAIQ … DVFLTVDSDTYIYPN.128Chs1Streptococcus cerevisiae494.VVCIISDGRSKINERS … NIVTLLDAGTMPGKD.610ExoMRhizobium meliloti39..LRVIVADNDAEPSARA … DFLAFLDDDETVSGD.106ExoORhizobium meliloti41..EVVVVDDCSADATPAL … RWIAVLDSDDTVRPD.104ExoURhizobium meliloti37..EVVVIDDGSTDDSASV … PLIGVLDADDFFFPG.102ExoWRhizobium meliloti34..HVLVIDDESPYPIADE … DFVAFLDSDDVWTPD.101NodCRhizobium meliloti58..RVYVVDDGSRNREAIV … DLVLNVDSDSTIAFD.124RfbASalmonella enterica35..SEVLIVDNGGLTDRHY … QVIAVADPDDINEPD.101 Open table in a new tab To date no biochemical studies have been carried out on a glycosyltransferase like KfiC, which is able to sequentially add UDP-sugars using both an inverting (β-bond) and retaining (α-bond) mechanism. In this study we used HCA (19Lemesle-Varloot L. Henrissat B. Gaboriaud C. Bissery V. Morgat A. Mornon J.P. Biochemie (Paris). 1990; 72: 555-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar) to predict regions of secondary structure homology between KfiC and other known β-glycosyltransferases. Based upon this information, potential catalytic aspartic acid residues within the conserved regions were changed by site-directed mutagenesis. The ability of modified KfiC to add each UDP-sugar to defined oligosaccharide substrates was then assessed. These studies confirmed that KfiC is a bifunctional transferase, and they identifed the catalytic aspartic acid residues essential for the UDP-GlcA β-glycosyltransferase activity. JM109(DE3) (Promega) was used for the expression of all constructs. Plasmid pGG1 (ampr) contains the kfiC gene encoding the KfiC transferase from the E. coli K5 capsule gene cluster amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into EcoRI site of pGEM5zf(+) (Promega). Expression is controlled by T7 promoter. Plasmid pPC6 (K5+, Cmr) contains the entire K5 capsule gene cluster cloned into pACYC184 (12Pazzani C. Rosenow C. Boulnois G. Brenner D. Jann K. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 5978-5983Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown toA 600 ∼0.6, pelleted by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min), and resuspended in 10 mm MgSO4. 100 μl of cells were mixed with 100 μl of the appropriate bacteriophage dilution, incubated for 20 min, mixed with 3 ml of molten soft top agar (∼45 °C), and poured onto selective agar plates. Plaque formation was assessed after overnight incubation. Mutagenesis was achieved using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene. Mutated DNA was fully sequenced using PRISM Ready Reaction DyeDeoxy Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit and automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems) to confirm that the desired mutation was the only change present. Bacterial cultures were grown to an A 600 0.6 at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm. Protein expression was induced by addition of 0.5 mm IPTG (final) for 90 min. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (10,000 × g, 10 min). The bacterial pellet was washed and resuspended in buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 30 mm MgSO4), and cells were lysed by sonication (4 × 20-s bursts with cooling) prior to undertaking transferase assays. Assays were carried out on cell lysates prepared as described above. The assay measured the incorporation of single radiolabeled UDP-sugars onto defined oligosaccharides substrates (either terminating with glucuronic acid orN-acetylglucosamine at the nonreducing end) in the presence of 1% Triton X-100. The full methods are as used by Lind et al. (20Lind T. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20705-20708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were prepared for Western blot analysis by centrifugation of cell lysates at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove debris. Subsequently, the supernatant was centrifuged (100,000 × g, 30 min) to separate membranes and cytosolic fractions. The membranes were washed, resuspended in T buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 10 mm MnCl2, 5 mm CaCl2, 1% Triton X-100), and stored frozen. The membranes were analyzed using standard 12% polyacrylamide electrophoresis gels, and following electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and probed with a rabbit anti-transferase antibody followed by a goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody. Detection was achieved using the ECL kit from Amersham, UK. HCA was carried out using a computer program obtained from B. Henrissat, Center de Recherches sur les Macromolecules Vegetales, CNRS, BP 53, 38041 Grenoble cedex 9, France. Alignments were made manually. Alignment of the HCA plot of the predicted amino acid sequence of KfiC with plots of other known β-glycosyltransferases revealed a common domain structure of repeating α-helix and β-strand motifs between amino acids 260–360 (Fig. 2). This conserved region corresponded to the previously named domain A of β-glycosyltransferases (17Saxena I.M. Brown Jr., R.M. Fevre M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within this domain, two aspartic acid residues at 301 and 352 in KfiC were identified as the highly conserved aspartic acid residues in the C-terminal loops of the β2 and β4 strands present in all of the β-glycosyltransferases (Fig. 2, TableI). For reasons of clarity only HCA alignments with hyaluronan synthase and chitin synthase (processive β-glycosyltransferases that utilize alternating UDP-GlcA and UDP-GlcNAc) are shown in Fig. 2, however, most β-glycosyltransferases may be aligned in this way. There is no evidence of domain B in KfiC and no conserved QXXRW amino acid motif (Fig. 2), which is characteristic of this domain (17Saxena I.M. Brown Jr., R.M. Fevre M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based upon the identification of the conserved domain A and the presence of the two highly conserved aspartic acid residues, a series of site-directed mutations were made. The aspartic acid (D) residues at 300, 301, 305, 352, and 354 within domain A were replaced with alanine (A) or glutamic acid (E) residues. The nucleotide sequence of the mutated kfiC gene was determined to confirm that no additional mutations had been introduced. The level of expression of each mutated KfiC protein following induction of the T7 promoter using IPTG was established by Western blot analysis using KfiC-specific antisera. All of the mutated KfiC proteins were expressed at similar levels comparable with that of the wild-type KfiC protein (Fig. 3). The over-expression of the kfiC gene in the absence of other capsule-related proteins results in large amounts of recombinant KfiC protein in inclusion bodies within the cell, but no detectable membrane-associated K5 glycosyltransferase activity. 2G. Griffiths and I. S. Roberts, unpublished results. However, overexpression of the kfiC gene in strains harboring the K5 capsule gene cluster results in an increase in membrane-associated K5 glycosyltransferase activity (14Petit C. Rigg G. Pazzani C. Smith A. Sieberth V. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). This suggests that other proteins encoded within the K5 capsule gene cluster are essential for the formation of a membrane-associated complex containing the KfiC glycosyltransferase. In order to provide the necessary kfiCminus background, but still retain the other K5 capsule proteins necessary for the formation of the K5 polysaccharide biosynthetic complex, a kfiC mutation was generated in plasmid pPC6 using the streptomycin suicide vector pKNG101 (21Kaniga K. Delor I. Cornelis G.R. Gene. 1991; 109: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). This vector requires thepir gene for replication and will not replicate in laboratory strains of E. coli lacking this gene (21Kaniga K. Delor I. Cornelis G.R. Gene. 1991; 109: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). A 0.8-kb DraI-BamHI fragment from within the center of the kfiC gene was cloned into pKNG101 to generate pNJC1. Plasmid pNJC1 was introduced into JM109DE3(pPC6), in which it cannot replicate, and transformants in which pNJC1 had become integrated into pPC6 via homologous recombination within the kfiC gene were selected using chloramphenicol and streptomycin (Fig. 4). The disruption of thekfiC gene in the resulting plasmid pPC6::NJC was confirmed by restriction mapping and Southern blotting (data not shown). It is predicted that the disruption of the KfiC gene in pPC6::NJC, will result in the expression of a truncated KfiC protein consisting of the first 381 amino acids, KfiC′ (Fig. 4). Strains harboring pPC6::NJC were unable to make a K5 capsule and were resistant to the K5-specific bacteriophage. The mutation in the kfiC gene in pPC6::NJC could be complemented by pGG1, which restored K5 capsule production and K5 bacteriophage sensitivity. The effect of the site-directed mutations in the kfiC gene on UDP-GlcA and UDP-GlcNAc transferase activity was determined by assaying the ability to add radiolabeled GlcA or GlcNAc from the corresponding UDP-sugar to defined oligosac-charides with either a GlcNAc or GlcA at their nonreducing end. The transferase activities were expressed as a percentage of the activity of the wild-type KfiC transferase activity in JM109DE3(pPC6::NJC; pGG1) following induction of kfiC expression by the addition of IPTG. As predicted, strain JM109DE3 had no detectable GlcA or GlcNAc transferase activity (Table II). While strain JM109DE3(pPC6::NJC) lacked any detectable GlcA transferase activity, surprisingly, it still expressed GlcNAc transferase activity at 71.6% of that of strain JM109DE3(pPC6::NJC; pGG1) (TableII). This suggests that the insertion of pNJC into pPC6 had not disrupted GlcNAc transferase activity. All of the site-directed mutations that changed aspartic acid to alanine in domain A, D300A, D301A, D305A, D352A, and D354A, lacked any detectable GlcA transferase activity but retained GlcNAc transferase activity comparable with that of JM109DE3(pPC6::NJC; pGG1) (Table II). The conservative changes D301E, D305E, and D352E also abolished detectable GlcA transferase activity, but had no effect on GlcNAc transferase activity (Table II). The conservative change D300E resulted in consistent low level GlcA transferase activity at 2.4% of that of the JM109DE3(pPC6::NJC;pGG1) (Table II), while the change D354E had less dramatic effects onGlcA transferase activity reducing it to 75% of that of JM109(pPC6::NJC;pGG1) (Table II).Table IIThe effect of each single amino acid change on the two glycosyltransferase activities of the KfiC enzymeConstructGlcNAc activity (percentage of wild type)GlcA activity (percentage of wild type)JM109DE30.1 (0.04)0.1 (0.06)pPC6::NJC71.6 (0.6)0.1 (0.02)D300A89.6 (24.8)0.3 (0.10)D300E112.8 (24.8)2.4 (1.10)D301A100.9 (11.3)0.2 (0.17)D301E131.2 (50.8)0.2 (0.20)D305A94.9 (25.6)0.3 (0.20)D305E112.9 (29.7)0.1 (0.02)D352A103.9 (25.2)0.2 (0.20)D352E71.7 (31.1)0.1 (0.06)D354A132.8 (50.1)0.3 (0.04)D354E152.7 (30.0)75.7 (21.0) Open table in a new tab The IPTG induction of expression of the kfiC gene in JM109DE3(pPC6::NJC, pGG1) increases the rate of both the GlcNAc and GlcA additions to the defined nonreducing end of K5 oligosaccharides. This confirms earlier studies that KfiC is a bifunctional transferase capable of adding GlcNAc and GlcA from the appropriate UDP-sugar to the nonreducing end of the polysaccharide chain.The same mechanism has been suggested for the chain elongation in proteoglycan biosynthesis (22Lidholt K. Lindahl U. Biochem. J. 1992; 287: 21-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) where a single protein catalyzes the same transferase reactions (20Lind T. Lindahl U. Lidholt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20705-20708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). β-Glycosyltransferases can be divided into two families on the basis of HCA of their predicted amino acid sequence (17Saxena I.M. Brown Jr., R.M. Fevre M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). β-Glycosyltransferases that add sugars to the reducing end of the polysaccharide chain, such as HasA or ChsI, have two conserved domains A and B (17Saxena I.M. Brown Jr., R.M. Fevre M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), while those that add sugar residues to the nonreducing end of the polysaccharide chain have only domain A (17Saxena I.M. Brown Jr., R.M. Fevre M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HCA of the predicted amino acid sequence of KfiC demonstrated the presence of a domain A, but there was no evidence for domain B (Fig. 2). This is in agreement with the current knowledge on K5 biosynthesis, which is believed to occur by the sequential addition of GlcA and GlcNAc residues to the nonreducing end of the growing K5 polysaccharide (23Finke A. Bronner D. Nikolaev A.V. Jann B. Jann K. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 4088-4094Crossref PubMed Google Scholar,24Lidholt K. Fielstad M. Jann K. Lindahl U. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 255: 87-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In contrast to the membrane-associated hyaluronate synthase (HasA) enzyme of group A streptococci which, when expressed alone in E. coli, is capable of synthesising hyaluronic acid (25DeAngelis P.L. Papaconstantinou J. Weigel P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19181-19184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 26Dougherty B.A. van de Rijn I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 169-175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), KfiC is unable to synthesize K5 polysaccharide in the absence of other K5 proteins (14Petit C. Rigg G. Pazzani C. Smith A. Sieberth V. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 17: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The formation of a membrane-bound biosynthetic complex consisting of up to 10 proteins would appear necessary for the functioning of the KfiC enzyme and the biosynthesis of K5 polysaccharide. 3G. Rigg and I. S. Roberts, unpublished results. It is likely that KfiC acts to extend a membrane-bound oligosaccharide acceptor synthesized by either the KfiA or KfiB proteins. The nature of this starting oligosaccharide and its linkage to the membrane is unknown, but presumably it terminates with either GlcA or GlcNAc at its nonreducing end. The catalytic mechanism of polysaccharide growth involves the formation of a glycosidic bond via the addition of sugars from UDP-sugar precursors to the growing polysaccharide chain. Depending on whether an α or β linkage is being formed, catalysis can take place either by an inversion mechanism with the α-linked UDP-sugar forming a β-linked product or by a retaining mechanism where an α-linked product is formed (27Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). In the case of the inversion reaction, a single nucleophilic substitution at the anomeric carbon atom of the UDP-sugar will be sufficent to generate the β configuration. This will involve two acidic active site amino acids that act as acid-base catalysts. In polysaccharide hydrolases, which are believed to function by a similar reaction mechanism, the catalytic amino acids have been shown to be either aspartic or glutamic acid (27Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). It is hypothesized that one of the two acidic residues acts as an acid catalyst to protonate the substrate, while the second residue acts as a base catalyst by deprotonating a water molecule (27Sinnott M.L. Chem. Rev. 1990; 90: 1171-1202Crossref Scopus (1497) Google Scholar). Inspection of the HCA of KfiC identified two highly conserved aspartic acid residues within domain A at positions 301 and 352. It is likley that these aspartic acid residues that are also conserved in the family of β-glycosyltransferases are likely to be the catalytically active amino acids for β-transferase activity (Table I). The occurrence of these conserved residues in close proximity to other aspartic acids D300, D305, D354, and D355 in KfiC may allow effective ionization of the residues (28Nagahashi S. Sudoh M. Ono N. Sawada R. Yamaguchi E. Uchida Y. Mio T. Takagi M. Arisawa M. Yamada-Okabe H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13961-13967Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of the aspartic acid residues within domain A combined with in vitro assays using oligosaccharides with defined nonreducing ends confirmed that this region is important for GlcA transferase activity. Mutations D300A, D301A, D305A, D352A, and D354A within domain A abolished GlcA transferase activity but left GlcNAc transferase activity unaffected. Conservative changes in which a glutamic acid residue was inserted in place of the aspartic acid, allowed the the catalytic aspartic acid residues to be further refined. The aspartic acid residues at positions 301 and 352 that are conserved in domain A of all of the β-glycosyltransferases (Table I) were essential for GlcA transferase activity, and changes to glutamic acid abolished any detectable activity. This is the first biochemical evidence that these conserved aspartic acid residues are important for β-glycosyltransferase activity. The inability to replace aspartic acid with a glutamic acid suggests that the size of the side chain as well as the charge is important for catalysis and β-glycosyltransferase activity. Likewise, the aspartic acid residue at position 305 was also essential for GlcA transferase activity in KfiC and could not be substituted by a glutamic acid residue. This aspartic acid residue is not conserved in other β-glycosyltransferases with no strong preference for an acidic amino acid at this position (Table I). This suggests that the absolute requirement for an aspartic acid residue at this position for GlcA transferase activity in KfiC may reflect structural considerations and the correct folding to generate the active site rather than playing a direct role in acid-base catalysis. The aspartic acid residue at position 354 in KfiC is highly conserved among the other β-glycosyltransferases, with only the chitin synthase enzyme ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae lacking an aspartic acid residue at this position (Table I). The observation that the D354A mutation abolished GlcA transferase activity while the conservative D354E change only reduced GlcA transferase activity to 75% of that of the wild type (Table II) suggests that there is a requirement for an acidic amino acid at this position but that the size of the side chain is less critical. None of the mutations within domain A effected GlcNAc transferase activity, indicating that a separate distinct active site is responsible for UDP-GlcNAc transferase activity. The insertion of the suicide vector pNJC1 (containing part of the KfiC sequence) into thekfiC gene on pPC6 resulted in the expression of a truncated KfiC protein consisting of the first 381 amino acids of the 520-amino acid full-length protein. The in vitro transferase assays using defined oligosaccharide acceptors clearly show that the truncated KfiC′ protein has lost the ability to add GlcA from UDP-GlcA to its acceptor but still retains the ability to add GlcNAc. Domain A is still present on the C terminus of the truncated KfiC′ protein, but the lack of GlcA transferase activity may indicate that sequences C-terminal to this region are also important for this activity and the correct folding of the protein to generate the GlcA transferase active site. The presence of GlcNAc transferase activity on KfiC′ indicates that the active site for the addition of GlcNAc is located in the first 381 amino acids of KfiC (Fig. 4). The observation that none of the mutations in domain A abolished GlcNAc transferase activity (Table II) would indicate that domain A is not involved in GlcNAc transferase activity and suggest that the GlcNAc transferase activity is located in the first 260 amino acids of KfiC prior to domain A (Fig. 4). HCA of the first 260 amino acids of KfiC did not show any strong similarity to known α-mannosyltransferases. This may be a consequence that these α-glycosyltransferases are transfering mannose from GDP-mannose rather than GlcNAc from UDP-GlcNAc as well as the fact that KfiC is a bifunctional enzyme having both α- and β-transferase activities. The association of the truncated KfiC′ protein with the K5 polysaccharide biosynthetic complex would indicate that the interaction between KfiC and other members of the K5 polysaccharide biosyntheic complex is mediated by structures present in the first 381 amino acids of KfiC. In summary, these results demonstrate that KfiC is a bifunctional transferase with both α- and β-glycosyltransferase activities. The site-directed mutagenesis and in vitro transferase assays using defined oligosaccharide acceptors demonstrated the role of conserved aspartic acid residues within domain A for β-glycosyltransferase activity. The two transferase activities could be separated with the UDP-GlcNAc α-glycosyltransferase activity being located in the first 300 amino acids of KfiC. Experiments are under way in order to determine the exact location and nature of the second active site responsible for the α addition of UDP-GlcNAc to the nonreducing end of the K5 polysaccharide."
https://openalex.org/W2084403941,"Apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) activates the plasma enzyme lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), catalyzing the rapid conversion of lipoprotein cholesterol to cholesterol ester. Structural mutants of apoA-I have been used to study the details of apoA-I-LCAT-catalyzed cholesterol ester formation. Several studies have shown that the α-helical segments corresponding to amino acids 143–164 and 165–186 (repeats 6 and 7) are essential for LCAT activation. In the present studies, we examined how the orientation of the hydrophobic face, independent of an increase in overall hydrophobicity, affects LCAT activation. We designed, expressed, and characterized a mutant, reverse of 6 apoA-I (RO6 apoA-I), in which the primary amino acid sequence of repeat 6 (amino acids 143–164) was reversed from its normal orientation. This mutation rotates the hydrophobic face of repeat 6 approximately 80°. Lipid-free RO6 apoA-I showed a marked stabilization when denatured by guanidine hydrochloride, but showed significant destabilization to guanidine hydrochloride denaturation in the lipid-bound state compared with wild-type apoA-I. Recombinant high density lipoprotein discs (rHDL) formed from RO6 apoA-I,sn-1-palmitoyl-sn-2-oleoyl phosphati-dylcholine, and cholesterol were approximately 12 Å smaller than wild-type apoA-I rHDL. The reduced size suggests that one of the repeats did not effectively participate in phospholipid binding and organization. Thesn-1-palmitoyl-sn-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine RO6 rHDL were a less effective substrate for LCAT. Mapping the entire lipid-free and lipid-bound RO6 apoA-I with a series of monoclonal antibodies revealed that both the lipid-free and lipid-bound RO6 apoA-I displayed altered or absent epitopes in domains within and adjacent to repeat 6. Together, these results suggest that the proper alignment and orientation of the hydrophobic face of repeat 6 is an important determinant for maintaining and stabilizing helix-bilayer and helix-helix interactions.

A number of investigations have focused on identifying the precise molecular mechanism by which apolipoprotein A-I activates LCAT. Studies of apoA-I deletion mutants have shown that the α-helical amino acid domains, 143–164 and 165–186 (repeats 6 and 7), were essential for LCAT activation and when removed from the primary sequence, severely disable (>95%) the ability of the protein to activate LCAT (5Minnich A.

Venkatachalapathi Y.V. Brouillette C.G. Segrest J.P. Arteriosclerosis. 1990; 10: 95-105Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It still, however, remains unclear which domain(s) are most important in LCAT activation and the mechanism(s) by which they activate the enzyme. Arranging all 10 apoA-I 11- or 22-mer repeats on Edmunson helical wheel diagrams clearly demonstrates the partitioning of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids onto opposite faces of the helical wheel, thus illustrating their amphipathic character (14Segrest J.P. Jackson R.L. Morrisett J.D. Gotto Jr., A.M. FEBS Lett. 1974; 38: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar, 15Segrest J.P. De Loof H. Dohlman J.G. Brouillette C.G. Anantharamaiah G.M.

Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Based on this property, it has been suggested that each apoA-I repeat cooperatively participates in organizing phospholipid into a discoidal complex (rHDL) through the alignment of their hydrophobic faces parallel to the phospholipid acyl chains. It has been proposed that the penetration depth of each 22-mer amphipathic domain correlates to its total hydrophobicity, i.e. to its overall hydrophobic amino acid composition (16Palgunachari M.N. Mishra V.K. Lund-Katz S. Phillips M.C. Adeyeye S.O. Alluri S. Anantharamaiah G.M. Segrest J.P. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 328-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). However, only recently has it become apparent that a interrelationship exists between the hydrophobic amino acid distribution and the ability of an amphipathic α-helix repeat to activate LCAT (17Sorci-Thomas M.G. Curtiss L. Parks J.S. Thomas M.J. Kearns M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7278-7284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). By examining the role of the hydrophobic residues within repeat 6 we have been able to refine our understanding of how apoA-I activates LCAT. Previous studies showed that substitution of apoA-I's repeat 10 for repeat 6 (10F6 apoA-I), significantly increased apoA-I rHDL's helix-bilayer stability to denaturation without altering global secondary conformation (17Sorci-Thomas M.G. Curtiss L. Parks J.S. Thomas M.J. Kearns M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7278-7284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The increase in apoprotein-phospholipid bilayer stability was accompanied by a substantial reduction in the ability of 10F6 apoA-I rHDL to activate LCAT. We proposed that the increase in helix-bilayer and helix-helix interactions that result from the repeat 10 for 6 substitution cause the 121–165 domain (repeats 5 and 6) to penetrate more deeply into the rHDL phospholipid bilayer, thereby restricting LCAT's access to the boundary phospholipid acyl chains and reducing the overall catalytic efficiency (17Sorci-Thomas M.G. Curtiss L. Parks J.S. Thomas M.J. Kearns M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7278-7284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In the present study we constructed a mutant apoA-I (RO6 apoA-I) having the hydrophobic face of repeat 6 rotated 80° with respect to wild-type apoA-I, and then characterized the ability of this mutant to bind lipid and activate LCAT. Discoidal rHDL containing RO6 apoA-I were significantly smaller in diameter, and exhibited a 5-fold lower ability to activate LCAT than wild-type apoA-I rHDL. Monoclonal antibody epitope mapping was used to analyze conformational changes. This technique demonstrated altered or absent epitopes spanning the domains adjacent to repeat 6 in both the lipid-free and lipid-bound RO6 apoA-I. These studies confirm the idea that the optimal alignment and orientation of repeat 6's hydrophobic face are important determinants in maintaining and stabilizing apoA-I helix-phospholipid bilayer interactions and that these interactions are key structural features regulating LCAT activation.

Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 187-209Google Scholar) and mutant apoA-I cDNAs were verified by complete DNA sequencing.

Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The molecular weights of the proteins were confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry on a Quattro II mass spectrometer. A molar ratio of 80:4:1, POPC:cholesterol:apoA-I was used for making rHDL essentially as described for the preparation ofl-α-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) wild-type and 10F6 apoA-I rHDL at a starting molar ratio of 100:5:1 (17Sorci-Thomas M.G.

Briefly, 1.9 mg of POPC in chloroform (30 mg/ml) was added to 48 μg of cholesterol dissolved in ethanol (10 mg/ml) and 10 μl (10 μCi) of radiolabeled [1,2-3H]cholesterol (50 Ci/mmol) in ethanol. Organic solvents were removed under a stream of argon and the tubes were placed under vacuum for 30 min. Sodium cholate, 2.1 mg, was added, the solution vortexed and then incubated for 30 min at 27 °C. The mixture was briefly vortexed 3 times during the 10-min incubation. To this mixture, 0.9 mg of wild-type or mutant apoA-I was added and the incubation continued for an additional 20 min at 4 °C. Sodium cholate was removed by dialysis against 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, and 0.15 mm sodium azide at 27 °C. The rHDL were then purified by passage through a Superose 12 (Pharmacia) column (55 × 1.8 cm) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Phospholipid, cholesterol, and protein assays were performed to determine the final molar composition of the rHDL (17Sorci-Thomas M.G. Curtiss L. Parks J.S. Thomas M.J. Kearns M.W. J. Biol.

A final concentration of 1% SDS was used in the Lowry method for protein determination of rHDL complexes to prevent solution turbidity. The number of molecules of mutant apoA-I per substrate particle was determined by apoprotein cross-linking with dimethyl suberimidate as described by Swaney (21Swaney J.B. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 128: 613-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) followed by SDS 4–30% polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis. DMPC and POPC rHDL sizes were determined using 4–30% nondenaturating gradient gel electrophoresis (22Rainwater D.L. Andres D.W. Ford A.L. Lowe W.F. Blanche P.J. Krauss R.M. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 1876-1881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as described previously (17Sorci-Thomas M.G. Curtiss L. Parks J.S. Thomas M.J. Kearns M.W. J. Biol.

Baldwin H.L. Goldberg A.P. Nichols A.V. J. Lipid Res. 1989; 30: 1085-1095Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Circular dichroism spectra were recorded with a Jasco J720 spectropolarimeter at 25 °C using a 0.1-cm path length cell. Ellipticity was measured at 222 nm. Five scans were recorded, averaged, and the background subtracted. Mean molar residue ellipticity (q) is reported as degrees cm2·dmol−1, and calculated from the equation, [q] = q obs·115/10 ·l · c, where q obs is the observed ellipticity at 222 nm in degrees, 115 is the mean residue molecular weight of the protein, l is the optical path length in centimeters, and c the protein concentration in g/ml. The percent α-helix content was calculated from the formula of Chen et al. (24Chen G.C. Guo L.S.S. Hamilton R.L. Gordon V. Richards E.G. Kane J. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 6530-6538Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) [q]222 = (−30,300·f h ) − 2,340. Stabilities of lipid-free and lipid-bound POPC rHDL were determined by plotting the mean residue ellipticity versus guanidine hydrochloride concentration and expressed as the concentration of GdnHCl that reduced the ellipticity by 50% (D½). Competitive solid-phase immunoassays were used to assess the binding of monoclonal antibodies to lipid-free apoA-I and POPC rHDL containing apoA-I. With two exceptions (antibodies AI-17 and AI-141.7) each antibody used in this study has been described and their epitopes on wild-type apoA-I documented (25Curtiss L.K. Banka C.L. J. Lipid Res. 1996; 37: 884-892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The epitopes of antibodies AI-17 and AI-147.7 were localized to residues 143–165 and 220–242, respectively, on the basis of their binding to apoA-I mutant proteins. 2L. Curtiss and M. G. Sorci-Thomas, unpublished observations. The immunoassays were performed as described (17Sorci-Thomas M.G. Curtiss L. Parks J.S. Thomas M.J. Kearns M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7278-7284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated human plasma apoA-I or plasma HDL (0.05 ml of 5 μg/ml) were immobilized onto 96-well Falcon 3911 Microtest III flexible assay plates. After postcoating the plates, increasing amounts of a purified apoA-I or recombinant A-I discs (0.025 ml) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline containing 3% normal goat serum were added to wells in the presence of 0.025 ml of ascites fluid containing a limiting amount of monoclonal antibody (typically dilutions of 1 × 10−4 to 1 × 10−6). Competitor concentrations listed in the figures represent the final concentrations (μg/ml) in the 0.05-ml reaction mixture. The plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washing the wells, mouse antibody binding to the immobilized antigen was detected by a second 1-h incubation at 37 °C with125I-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG. All data were expressed as B/B o where B is the counts/min bound in the presence of competitor, andB o is the counts/min bound in the absence of competitor. To compare the affinity of the antibodies for POPC rHDL containing wild-type or mutant apoA-I as competitor, the slopes of logit-transformed B/B o ratios were determined by linear regression and subjected to tests of equality. The LCAT reaction was monitored by following the cholesterol to cholesterol ester conversion using POPC rHDL containing either wild-type or mutant apoA-I. The complexes were assayed in duplicate using 0–1.0 μg of substrate cholesterol in a final concentration of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 140 mmNaCl, 0.25 mm EDTA, and 0.15 mm sodium azide, 0.6% fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin, 2 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 25 ng of purified human plasma LCAT (26Parks J.S. Thuren T.Y. Schmitt J.D. J. Lipid Res. 1992; 33: 879-887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reactions were carried out for 15–60 min at 37 °C, and the conversion of [3H]cholesterol to [3H]cholesterol ester was determined by lipid extraction of the incubation mixture followed by thin layer chromatography. The extent of cholesterol esterification was kept below 15% to maintain first-order kinetics. The fractional cholesterol esterification rate was expressed as nanomoles of cholesterol ester formed per hour per ml of LCAT, as described previously (17Sorci-Thomas M.G. Curtiss L. Parks J.S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 7278-7284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) of rHDL cholesterol substrate concentration (μm) divided by the cholesterol ester formation rate (nmol/h/ml LCAT) versus rHDL cholesterol concentration (μm). Values are given as the mean ± S.D. Statistical comparisons were made using the Student's ttest. Edmunson helical wheel diagrams of repeat 6, shown in Fig.1, for wild-type and RO6 apoA-I show that the hydrophobic and hydrophilic face orientations differ by approximately 80°. We hypothesized that the rotation of the hydrophobic face relative to the adjacent helical domains would disrupt the protein-lipid stabilization normally present in wild-type apoA-I. Potential stabilizing apoprotein helix-phospholipid bilayer interactions affected by the rotation include hydrophobic interactions between the hydrophobic face of repeat 6 residues and the phospholipid bilayer as well as hydrophobic and hydrophilic interactions between repeat 6 and adjacent repeats 5 and 7. To characterize the properties of RO6 apoA-I we prepared rHDL containing either DMPC or POPC at a 100:5:1 or 80:4:1, phospholipid:cholesterol:apoprotein molar ratio, respectively. As shown in Fig. 2, nondenaturating gradient gel electrophoresis showed that the column purified DMPC or POPC RO6 apoA-I rHDL were approximately 8–11 Å smaller in diameter than DMPC or POPC wild-type apoA-I rHDL.

Recombinant HDL composed of Δ6 apoA-I, a mutant apoA-I having the complete deletion of repeat 6 (amino acids 143–164), formed complexes of the same size as the RO6 apoA-I, Table I.

Open table in a new tab The denaturation of lipid-free and lipid-bound RO6 apoA-I by GdnHCl showed that lipid-free RO6 apoA-I had a significantly higherD 1/2 = 1.39 ± 0.05 m, than lipid-free wild-type apoA-I, D½ = 1.02 ± 0.05 m (n = 3, p < 0.05), suggesting that repeat 6 of RO6 apoA-I is more stabilized by inter-helical interactions than lipid-free wild-type apoA-I. Mutant lipid-free Δ6 and 10F6 apoA-I had D½ values of 1.30 ± 0.10 and 1.46 ± 0.09 m, respectively, similar to RO6 apoA-I, whereas, lipid-free Δ5/6 apoA-I had aD½ = 1.00 ± 0.06 m, that was similar to wild-type apoA-I (Table II). These results suggest that the greater degree of apoprotein inter-helical association in 10F6, RO6, and Δ6 apoA-I results from a conformation adopted to minimize hydrophobic residue exposure to the polar aqueous environment.

In the present study, we examined the role of the TNF-α autocrine loop in PMA-induced macrophage differentiation and gene expression of 92- and 72-kDa gelatinases (MMP-9 and MMP-2). In HL-60 cells, PMA inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell adhesion and spreading, expression of surface maturation marker OKM1 and phagocytic activity, as well as the expression of both gelatinases, which all characterize the macrophage phenotype. In contrast, TNF-α alone was only effective in inhibiting cell proliferation. Blocking the endogenous TNF-α activity with neutralizing anti-TNF-α antibodies abolished all these PMA-induced events with the exception of MMP-2 gene expression. Since fibronectin (FN)-mediated cell adhesion and spreading are prerequisite for both macrophage differentiation and MMP-9 gene expression in HL-60 cells, we hypothesized that TNF-α might be involved in modulating the expression of either the FN or its integrin receptor genes. Whereas PMA substantially enhanced the steady state mRNA and protein levels of both FN and α5β1 integrins, TNF-α alone had little effect on the expression of these genes. However, anti-TNF-α antibodies blocked PMA-induced augmentation of both α5and β1 integrin gene expression without affecting the expression of the FN gene. Our results suggest that TNF-α may regulate macrophage differentiation and critical matrix-degrading activities of myeloid progenitor cells in an autocrine manner by augmenting surface levels of the α5β1integrin, thus promoting interactions with the extracellular matrix, a key event for maturation and migration of these cells during inflammation.

Cerami A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 317-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). In addition to being a mediator of activated macrophage function, TNF-α is known to be a feedback modulator of macrophage differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells. The effects of TNF-α on proliferation and differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells are bidirectional, depending on the differentiation state and potential of the target cells as well as the hematopoietic growth factors used to promote their differentiation. Whereas TNF-α acts synergistically with macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) to stimulate proliferation of bone marrow cells differentiating toward the macrophage lineage (2Branch D.R. Turner A.R. Guilbert L.J. Blood. 1989; 73: 307-311Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the cytokine inhibits the proliferation and promotes macrophage differentiation of bone marrow progenitor cells in the presence of stem cell factor or granulocyte-macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (3Rusten L.A.

Blood. 1993; 82: 3019-3028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); TNF-α exerts these effects in both an autocrine and paracrine manner. In addition, TNF-α has been shown to be identical to a differentiation-inducing factor produced by mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood monocytes and leukemic cell lines that is capable of inducing monocyte-like characteristics in a number of myeloid cell lines (6Takeda K.

However, how TNF-α-induced gene expression contributes to macrophage differentiation of myeloid progenitor cells remains poorly characterized. The 92-kDa (MMP-9) and 72-kDa (MMP-2) gelatinases, which belong to the matrix metalloproteinase family, are the key proteinases governing the degradation of basement membrane (7Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1990; 9: 289-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Both MMP-9 and MMP-2 cleave basement membrane collagen types IV and V as well as different types of gelatin (8Hibbs M.S. Hoidal J.R. Kang A.H. J. Clin.

J. 1989; 258: 463-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Although the two proteinases share structural and catalytic similarities, their gene expression is differentially regulated, partly due to the distinct structure of the regulatory elements and promoters in their genes (12Huhtala P.

Both MMP-9 and MMP-2 are produced by human macrophages, and their proteolytic activities are thought to be necessary for various functions of monocytes and macrophages such as extravasation, migration, and tissue remodeling during chronic inflammatory conditions (15Campbell E.J.

Although a number of previous studies have shown that the production of these MMPs is markedly up-regulated during macrophage differentiation, the regulatory mechanisms mediating this event remain to be elucidated. Human HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells retain the ability to differentiate along the monocyte, macrophage, or granulocyte pathway (19Collins S.J. Blood. 1989; 70: 1233-1244Crossref Google Scholar). This cell line, therefore, serves as a useful model system for studying the critical cellular events involved in these differentiation processes. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) induces HL-60 cells to differentiate toward the macrophage lineage (20Huberman E. Callaham M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1293-1297Crossref PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar, 21Rovera G. Santoli D. Damsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1979; 76: 5158-5162Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar), and the TNF-α gene is one of the early response genes induced by PMA during this process (23Horiguchi J. Spriggs D. Imamura K. Stone R. Leubbers R. Kufe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 252-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In this study, we explored the role of TNF-α as an autocrine regulator in PMA-induced HL-60 differentiation. We examined four characteristic macrophage markers induced by PMA: (i) inhibition of cell replication; (ii) cell adhesion and spreading; (iii) manifestation of the surface maturation marker OKM1 (CD11b); and (iv) phagocytic activity. Although TNF-α was as effective as PMA in inhibiting cell replication, it could not induce the other three differentiation markers. However, neutralizing anti-TNF-α antibodies inhibited all four PMA-induced macrophage markers, indicating that TNF-α is an autocrine factor critical for PMA-induced macrophage differentiation in HL-60 cells. In addition, treatment with anti-TNF-α antibodies abolished PMA-induced MMP-9 gene expression without affecting the PMA-induced expression ofMMP-2, suggesting that TNF-α does not mediate all PMA-induced gene expression in HL-60 cells. We demonstrate herein that one of the mechanisms whereby TNF-α modulates PMA-induced macrophage differentiation and MMP-9 gene expression is through augmenting the gene expression of the surface adhesion molecule α5β1 integrin. Our results suggest that TNF-α may act in an autocrine manner to enhance macrophage differentiation and matrix-degrading capability via promoting interactions of myeloid progenitor cells with extracellular matrix proteins. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) was purchased from Chemicals for Cancer Research (Eden Prairie, MN). Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (>1.0 × 108 units/mg) was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim. Gelatin and a mouse monoclonal antibody (mAb) to human CD11b (OKM1) (IgG1) and mAb to human FN (FN-15, IgG1), which was dialyzed before use, were purchased from Sigma. Mouse mAbs to human β1 (K20, IgG2a) and α5 (SAM1, IgG2b) integrin were obtained from Immunotech (Westbrook, ME). Both monoclonal (mouse) and polyclonal (goat) anti-TNF-α neutralizing antibodies were purchased from R & D Systems (Minneapolis, MN) and were found equally effective in our study. Mouse IgG1 and goat IgG were also purchased from R & D Systems and used as a control. The experiments presented in this study were conducted by using polyclonal anti-TNF-α antibodies and goat IgG. The human HL-60 myeloid leukemia cell line was originally obtained from R. C. Gallo (National Cancer Institute). The cells were cultured and maintained in Petri dishes in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Intergen Co., Purchase, NY), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), andl-glutamine (2 mm) (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a humidified atmosphere containing 8% CO2 at 37 °C. All treatments were carried out in tissue culture dishes or cluster plates in serum-supplemented RPMI 1640 medium. To determine the differentiation markers, HL-60 cells were seeded at 2–4 × 105cells/ml and treated for 24 h with 3 nm PMA or 10 ng/ml (>103 units/ml) TNF-α in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml preimmune IgG or anti-TNF-α antibodies. The number of cells was determined by hemocytometer chamber counting; the percentage of cell adhesion and spreading was determined as described previously (24Bauvois B. Rouillard D. Sanceau J. Wietzerbin J. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3912-3919PubMed Google Scholar), and the percentage of cells exhibiting a cell surface maturation antigen OKM1 was determined by indirect immunofluorescent staining with the OKM1 mAb. To examine the phagocytic activity, the cells (7 × 104 cells/well) were plated in eight-well Lab-Tak chamber slides (Nunc, Inc., Naperville, IL) and treated as described above. After treatment, the cells were incubated for 18 h with 2 × 106 sterilized and opsonized 1.72-μm (diameter) Fluoresbrite beads (Polysciences, Inc., Warrington, PA) (25Blair O.C. Carbone R. Santorelli A.C. Cytometry. 1986; 7: 171-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Thereafter, the medium was rapidly aspirated, and the cells fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 20 min prior to permeabilization for 20 min with 10 μg/ml l-α-lysophosphatidylcholine (Sigma). The cells were then stained for 10 min at room temperature with 0.1 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Boehringer Mannheim), followed by three washes in PBS and a 15-min incubation in hydroethidine working solution (Polysciences, Inc.). Following three final washes in PBS, the cells were mounted with phosphate-buffered gelatol (Becton Dickinson, Sunnyvale, CA) and analyzed by a Micro-Tome Mac Digital Confocal microscope system (VayTek, Inc., Fairfield, IA) attached to a Leitz Orthoplan fluorescence microscope. The cells were considered positive if they engulfed ≥20 beads/cell. The cells (7 × 104 cells/well) were seeded in eight-well Lab-Tek chamber slides and treated for 24 h with 3 nm PMA in the absence or presence of 10 μg/ml preimmune IgG or anti-TNF-α antibodies. After treatment, the cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with a blocking solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 1% normal goat serum (Sigma) in PBS, followed by a 2-h incubation with the appropriate primary mAb at saturating concentrations. The cells were then washed twice with PBS and incubated for an additional 45 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Following three washes in PBS, the slides were mounted with phosphate-buffered gelatol. Fluorescence was examined using the Micro-Tome Mac Digital Confocal microscope described above. The cells (1.5 × 105cells/ml) were treated in serum-supplemented RPMI 1640 medium as indicated in the figure legends. After treatment, the cells were replaced with serum-free medium containing the appropriate antibodies and incubated for an additional 24 h prior to collection of conditioned media. Gelatin zymography analysis was performed on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 1 mg/ml gelatin (Sigma) as described previously (26Morodomi T. Ogata Y. Sasaguri Y. Morimatsu M. Nagase H. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 603-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Gelatinolytic activity was visualized as clear zones with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining. Total RNA was purified by centrifugation through a cesium chloride cushion as described by Chirgwin et al. (27Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. MacDonald A.E. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16621) Google Scholar). Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (28Glesne D.A. Collart F.R. Huberman E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5417-5425Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Hybridizations were performed with radiolabeled probes at 60 °C for 18–24 h in 0.5m sodium phosphate, pH 7.2, 2 mm EDTA, 1% bovine serum albumin, 7% SDS. The blots were washed at 60 °C for 30 min once in 1× SSPE (10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 150 mm sodium chloride, 1 mm EDTA), 0.1% SDS, and once in 0.1× SSPE, 0.1% SDS, followed by autoradiographing in the dark at −80 °C. Human cDNA probe for MMP-9 was kindly provided by Dr. W. Stetler-Stevenson, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda. Human cDNA probes for MMP-2, TNF-α, and GAPDH were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD), and those for α5 and β1integrins were from Life Technologies, Inc. The mRNA level of a specific gene relative to that of GAPDH was determined by using a HP ScanJet 4c Scanner (Hewlett-Packard). Total RNA was purified as described above. cDNA was synthesized from total cellular RNA using SuperScriptTM II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) under the conditions recommended by the supplier. The reverse transcriptase (RT) reaction used 1–2 μg of total RNA and either 100 ng of oligo(dT) primer or 2 pmol of a gene-specific primer. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification used Tfl polymerase (Stratagene) under conditions recommended by the supplier. The FN template primers, F1F/F2R (nucleotides (nt) 3945–3966 and 4325–4346; 396-bp product) and F5F/F6R (nt 3981–4001 and 4706–4727; 746 bp product) were derived from the human sequence (GenBankTM accession numberX02761). The combination of primer F5F and F2R resulted in a 365-bp PCR product and was used for this study. The template primers for human GAPDH, G1F/G2R (nt 19–39 and 713–734; 715-bp product), were derived from the human sequence (GenBankTM accession numberX01677). One set of cycle parameters was used for all primers (denaturation at 94 °C, 50 s; annealing at 63 °C, 1 min; extension at 73 °C, 1 min) with the total number of cycles (25–40) tailored to the specific primer pair. For all reactions, various amounts of RNA samples and the RT reaction were used to ensure correspondence between the amount of amplification product and the input of RNA samples. For the FN amplification reactions, at least three independent primer pairs were used for reverse transcriptase reaction to validate the amplification pattern. To assess the role TNF-α plays in regulating macrophage differentiation induced by PMA in HL-60 cells, we first examined its effect on PMA-induced cell adhesion and spreading, which are the hallmarks of macrophage differentiation (19Collins S.J. Blood. 1989; 70: 1233-1244Crossref Google Scholar). Whereas more than 90% HL-60 cells exhibited cell adhesion and spreading after a 24-h PMA treatment, TNF-α-treated cells remained in suspension and demonstrated no apparent morphological changes as compared with the untreated HL-60 cells (Table I and Fig.1, a–c). Blocking the endogenous TNF-α activities by neutralizing anti-TNF-α antibodies prevented PMA-induced cell adhesion and spreading (Table Iand Fig. 1 d), indicating that PMA-induced cell adhesion and spreading in these cells involve the autocrine TNF-α loop.Table IManifestation of differentiation markers in HL-60 cells treated for 24 h with 10 ng/ml TNF-α or 3 nm PMA in the presence or absence of 10 μg/ml anti-TNF-α antibodies or preimmune IgGTreatmentCell numberaHL-60 cells were plated at 2 × 105cells/ml and treated for 24 h with respective reagents as indicated.

TNF-α at 10 ng/ml was as potent as PMA at 3 nm in inhibiting HL-60 cell proliferation at 24 h after treatment. Neutralizing anti-TNF-α antibodies (10 μg/ml) were able to largely reverse both the PMA- and the TNF-α-induced growth inhibition. In addition, treatment with PMA resulted in approximately 85% HL-60 cells exhibiting reactivity with the OKM1 mMAb, which is characteristic of mature human monocytes, macrophages, and granulocytes (29Foon K.A. Schroff R.W. Gale R.P. Blood. 1982; 60: 1-19Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of anti-TNF-α antibodies, but not the IgG control, to PMA-treated cells reduced cell reactivity with the OKM1 mAb to 5% or less, which is similar to the basal level observed in untreated or TNF-α-treated cells. Similarly, anti-TNF-α antibodies caused a more than 70% reduction in PMA-induced phagocytic activity, a primary function of mature macrophages, whereas exogenous TNF-α had no effect compared with the untreated cells. Based on these results, we conclude that TNF-α is an autocrine regulator of PMA-induced macrophage differentiation in HL-60 cells but in itself it is insufficient to induce a macrophage phenotype. Thus, additional factor(s), which have yet to be identified, are required to cooperate with TNF-α to generate sufficient signals for macrophage differentiation in HL-60 cells. The induction of matrix-degrading proteinases such as the 92-kDa (MMP-9) and 72-kDa (MMP-2) gelatinases is associated with macrophage differentiation (15Campbell E.J. Cury J.D. Shapiro S.D. Goldberg G.I. Welgus H.G. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1286-1293PubMed Google Scholar, 16Welgus H.G. Campbell E.J. Cury J.D. Eisen A.Z. Senior R.M. Wilhelm S.M. Goldberg G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar, 17Watanabe H. Nakanishi I. Yamashita K. Hayakawa T. Okada Y. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 991-999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PMA treatment (3 nm) resulted in the induction of both MMP-2and MMP-9 gene expression (Fig.2, A and B), with the level of MMP-2 steady state mRNA being much lower than that of the MMP-9 steady state mRNA (3 days' exposure of the autoradiograph film for MMP-2 versus 6-h exposure for MMP-9). Accordingly, MMP-2 secretion was barely detectable by gelatin zymogram (data not shown), whereas secretion of MMP-9 proenzyme was abundant (Fig. 2 C). Compared with PMA, TNF-α (10 ng/ml) only weakly induced MMP-2 and MMP-9 gene expression as well as MMP-9 proenzyme secretion. Anti-TNF-α antibodies abolished PMA-induced MMP-9 but notMMP-2 gene expression (Fig. 2, A andB). The effect of the antibody treatment on secretion of the MMP-9 proenzyme (Fig. 2 C) mirrored that on its mRNA. These findings suggest that while PMA-induced MMP-9 gene expression is mediated through the TNF-α autocrine loop, PMA-inducedMMP-2 gene expression is independent of the endogenous TNF-α activity. Since we found previously that both PMA-induced macrophage differentiation 2A. Laouar, C. B. H. Chubb, F. R. Collart, and E. Huberman, manuscript in preparation. and MMP-9 gene expression (30Xie B. Laouar A. Huberman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11576-11582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) required FN-mediated cell adhesion and spreading, and anti-TNF-α antibodies blocked this process, we suspected that TNF-α might be the intermediary that controls PMA-induced gene expression of FN or its surface integrin receptors. To confirm this hypothesis, we examined the expression of the FN and α5β1 integrin genes in PMA- and TNF-α-treated HL-60 cells, and we determined the effect of anti-TNF-α antibodies on these events. We did not include the α4β1 integrin in this study because this integrin was not involved in FN-mediated cell adhesion and spreading induced by PMA or M-CSF in both HL-60 and human peripheral blood monocytes.2 Expression of both α5 and β1 integrin genes was examined by Northern blotting analysis. The FN gene expression was assayed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), because its expression was induced in low abundance and Northern blotting analysis yielded inconsistent results. Three sets of FN primers were tested, and the results shown in Fig. 3 Arepresent amplification of a single 365-bp FN fragment. Various amounts of RNA samples and the RT reaction were used to ensure that amplification of the 365-bp FN fragment corresponded to the input of RNA samples. PMA (3 nm) induced a 5-fold increase in the level of FN steady state mRNA (Fig. 3 A), which was followed by cell surface display and extracellular deposition of the FN protein (Fig. 4). Similarly, PMA also enhanced the steady state level of β1 integrin mRNA by 4-fold and α5 integrin mRNA by 6-fold (Fig.3 B), with concomitant increases in surface expression of the respective protein (Fig. 4). TNF-α alone failed to affect expression of FN or α5 or β1 integrin gene. Blocking the endogenous TNF-α activity with anti-TNF-α antibodies had little or no effect on PMA-induced FN steady state mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 3 A and Fig. 4), demonstrating that PMA-induced FN expression requires neither the autocrine TNF-α loop nor cell adhesion and spreading. In contrast, treatment with anti-TNF-α antibodies resulted in a substantial reduction in PMA-induced β1 and α5 gene expression (Fig.3 B and Fig. 4). Accordingly, surface levels of both β1 and α5 proteins stimulated by PMA were substantially inhibited by anti-TNF-α antibodies (Fig. 4). Taken together, our results have shown that TNF-α is an autocrine mediator for PMA-induced augmentation of α5β1integrin gene expression, but TNF-α alone is insufficient and necessitates additional factor(s) to stimulate α5β1 gene expression. Our findings were further supported by the temporal sequence of expression of the FN, TNF-α, and α5β1 integrin genes induced by PMA. As shown in Fig. 5 A, PMA induced an early and transient expression of the TNF-α gene. Peak induction of the TNF-α steady state mRNA was observed at 2 h after PMA treatment, which was maintained for up to 4 h. The TNF-α steady state mRNA levels then dropped markedly at 8 h and became nearly undetectable at 24 h after treatment. The induction of TNF-α gene expression was followed by augmented expression of the β1 and α5 genes, which started at 4–8 h after addition of PMA and steadily increased thereafter for up to 24 h (Fig. 5 A). On the other hand, induction of the FN gene expression occurred within 30 min after addition of PMA, and the FN steady state mRNA levels increased steadily for at least 24 h after PMA treatment (Fig.5 B). Therefore, induction of FN gene expression occurs before that of TNF-α, which is consistent with our conclusion that PMA-induced FN expression is independent of the autocrine TNF-α activities.Figure 4Immunofluorescent staining of cell surface α5β1 integrin and fibronectin in HL-60 cells treated with PMA in the presence or absence of anti-TNF-α antibodies. The cells were either untreated (Control) or treated for 24 h with 3 nm PMA in the absence or presence of 10 μg/ml anti-TNF-α antibodies. After incubation, the cells were reacted with mAb to FN, β1 or α5integrin at 1:30 dilution without fixation and permeabilization for 2 h at 25 °C, then washed with PBS and reacted with goat anti-mouse IgG fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate. Immunofluorescence was examined under a digital confocal microscope. Note that surface levels of both β1 and α5 integrins are distinctly enhanced by PMA treatment and nearly diminished to the basal level in the presence of anti-TNF-α antibodies, whereas FN staining remained unaffected by the anti-TNF-α antibodies.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 5Time-course study of steady state mRNA levels of TNF-α, α5β1 integrin, and fibronectin in PMA-treated HL-60 cells.

Consistent with our finding, several previous studies have established TNF-α as a competence factor which primes the progenitor cells at early stages of macrophage differentiation. TNF-α acts in concert with other hematopoietic growth factors to inhibit cell proliferation and promote maturation, and this action may be achieved in either an autocrine or paracrine fashion. TNF-α was found to be expressed in all colonies of bone marrow progenitor cells induced to differentiate toward the macrophage lineage by M-CSF or GM-CSF, regardless of the differentiation stages, suggesting an important role of this molecule during macrophage differentiation (31Witsell A.L. Schook L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1963-1967Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Blocking the endogenous TNF-α activity during GM-CSF-induced macrophage differentiation in bone marrow progenitor cells resulted in increased cell proliferation, suggesting the involvement of an autocrine mechanism in which TNF-α expression signals the onset of differentiation and the cessation of proliferation (4Witsell A.L. Schook L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4754-4758Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar); there seemed to be a time window during which the differentiating cells were responsive to the endogenous production of TNF-α, since blocking TNF-α expression was effective on day 3 of differentiation but not on other days. Similarly, in a study using neonatal cord blood-derived stem cells (5Santiago-Schwarz F. Divaris N. Kay C. Carsons S.E. Blood. 1993; 82: 3019-3028Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it has been found that there is a window of sensitivity related to the priming effects of TNF-α; stem cells pretreated with TNF-α for up to 3 days responded to the differentiating effects of GM-CSF, and after 5 days of TNF-α pretreatment, GM-CSF was unable to promote maturation. Although the cellular events triggered by TNF-α during macrophage differentiation in these progenitor cells remain to be clarified, our findings in HL-60 cells provide hints that one of these events may be the stimulation of gene expression of surface adhesion molecules such as α5β1 integrin, thus promoting interactions of immature cells with the marrow microenvironment. In accordance with this hypothesis, synthesis and surface expression of the α5β1 integrin are stimulated by M-CSF during macrophage differentiation of bone marrow precursor cells (32Shima M. Teitelbaum S.L. Holers V.M. Ruzicka C. Osmack P. Ross F.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 5179-5183Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and mature monocytes constitutively express an abundance of this integrin (33Hemler M.E. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1990; 8: 365-400Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that appearance of this integrin is an event accompanying macrophage differentiation. Indeed, we found that blocking the endogenous TNF-α activity with neutralizing anti-TNF-α antibodies failed to affect PMA- or M-CSF-induced cell adhesion and maturation in human peripheral blood monocytes, 3B. Xie and E. Huberman, unpublished results. suggesting that TNF-α acts at differentiation stages preceding the monocytic maturation. During macrophage differentiation, one of the major changes in gene expression is the induction of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) such as 92- and 72-kDa gelatinases (MMP-9 and MMP-2, respectively) (15Campbell E.J. Cury J.D. Shapiro S.D. Goldberg G.I. Welgus H.G. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 1286-1293PubMed Google Scholar, 16Welgus H.G. Campbell E.J. Cury J.D. Eisen A.Z. Senior R.M. Wilhelm S.M. Goldberg G.I. J.

Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 991-999Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Production of these enzymes is thought to be critical for extravasation and migration of monocytes and macrophages through the extracellular matrix (18Saren P. Welgus H.G. Kovanen P.T. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 4159-4165PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown in a separate report (30Xie B. Laouar A. Huberman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11576-11582Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) that differentiation-associated MMP-9 gene expression in HL-60 cells and in human peripheral blood monocytes requires FN-mediated cell adhesion and spreading; signaling of the FN-induced MMP-9gene expression is channeled through the α5β1 integrin receptor and apparently does not involve the α4β1 receptor. Dependence of PMA-induced MMP-9 gene expression on FN/integrin-mediated cell adhesion and spreading is further confirmed by our finding in this study; treatment with neutralizing anti-TNF-α antibodies causes down-regulation of α5β1 integrin gene expression, resulting in substantial inhibition of cell adhesion and spreading as well as of MMP-9 gene expression. The autocrine regulation of TNF-α is not restricted to the MMP-9 gene expression. In U937 cells, PMA-induced gene expression of interstitial collagenase (MMP-1) is also significantly reduced by anti-TNF-α antibodies (34Callaghan M.M. Loris R.M. Rammohan C. Lu Y. Pope R.M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 59: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), suggesting that TNF-α is a key molecule in controlling the critical matrix-degrading activities during macrophage differentiation. The MMP whose expression escapes the control of TNF-α is MMP-2, providing another example of dissociated regulation of this MMP and other members of the MMP family. It is intriguing that PMA induces MMP-2 gene expression in HL-60 (this study) and U937 cells (16Welgus H.G. Campbell E.J. Cury J.D. Eisen A.Z. Senior R.M. Wilhelm S.M. Goldberg G.I. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 86: 1496-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar), although its promoter does not contain an AP-1 site (12Huhtala P. Chow L.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11077-11082Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since we noted an 8-h lag phase for PMA-induced MMP-2gene expression,3 it is possible that induction of MMP-2 is not directly mediated by PMA but rather by factors induced by PMA. In summary, we have shown in the present study that TNF-α acts as a feedback regulator of PMA-induced macrophage differentiation in HL-60 cells. The cytokine also plays a role in controlling the gene expression of matrix-degrading proteinases such as MMP-9 during PMA-induced macrophage differentiation. Our findings suggest that during inflammatory responses, TNF-α may cooperate with other hematopoietic factors to promote maturation of myeloid progenitor cells and their migration through the extracellular matrix by modulating the gene expression of integrins, the key cell surface receptors for matrix macromolecules."

Members of the ErbB (also known as the human epidermal growth factor receptor or HER) family of receptor tyrosine kinases play a central role in embryonic development as evidenced by observations that mice lacking these receptors die in utero or soon after birth (1Lemke G. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 1996; 7: 247-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar).

In contrast, ErbB2 is not activated directly by any known ligand whereas ErbB3 is devoid of intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (4Guy P.M. Platko J.V. Cantley L.C. Cerione R.A. Carraway III, K.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8132-8136Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). Transactivation of ErbB2 is a common and perhaps obligatory step in ligand-activated processes involving EGFR, ErbB3, and ErbB4 (5Burden S. Yarden Y. Neuron. 1997; 18: 847-855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar). Importantly, human cancers of epithelial origin are especially prone to expressing dysregulated ErbB receptors with overexpression of EGFR or ErbB2 being the most common molecular alteration encountered (6Hynes N.E.

These observations taken together with the combinatorial nature of the receptor-signaling pathways suggest that the relative levels of receptor expression and control of their activation are critical in maintaining normal homeostasis. Neuregulins, also known as heregulins (HRGs) or neudifferentiation factors, are a family of ligands that bind with low affinity to ErbB3 or ErbB4. In the presence of ErbB2 a high affinity heteromeric receptor complex is formed (8Sliwkowski M.X. Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D. Nuijens A. Fendly B.M. Cerione R.A. Vandlen R.L.

Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3402-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Despite these strong structural similarities, the binding specificity of EGF and HRG are distinct and mutually exclusive.

In this study, a comprehensive mutational analysis of theegf domain of HRGβ was conducted to determine areas critical for binding receptors and initiating signal transduction. Individual amino acids of the HRGβ egf domain were changed to alanine to identify loss of binding. To facilitate this, mutants were expressed monovalently on phagemids and analyzed for binding to ErbB3 and ErbB4 receptor-IgG fusion proteins in an ELISA format. Selected mutants were expressed in Escherichia coli as thioredoxin (Trx) fusion proteins for further characterization. We identified regions of the molecule critical for the preservation of binding to the receptors. Mutation of some residues had similar effects on binding to both receptors, while other changes had differential effects on ErbB3 and ErbB4 binding. Comparison of the HRG binding data and mutagenesis studies of EGF indicates that there are both similarities and differences in how these ligands interact with their receptors. We also characterized receptor binding and phosphorylation by many of the alanine mutants on cells expressing ErbB receptors. All of the mutants tested were able to induce phosphorylation and MAPK activation through ErbB4 receptors and were able to modulate a transphosphorylation signal from ErbB3 to ErbB2 in MCF7 cells. The egf domain of HRGβ (177–244) was expressed in bacteria. This form of HRGβ was radioiodinated as described previously (8Sliwkowski M.X. Schaefer G. Akita R.W. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D.

Preparation of receptor-IgGs was described by Fitzpatrick et al. 3V. D. Fitzpatrick, P. I. Pisacane, R. L. Vandlen, and M. X. Sliwkowski, manuscript in preparation. Alanine mutants were generated by Kunkel mutagenesis (16Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) using the phagemid display vector pHRG2-g3 as a template (43Ballinger M.D. Jones J.T. Lofgren J.A. Fairbrother W.J.

Chem. 1997; 273: 11675-11684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (44) Google Scholar). pHRG2-g3 contains residues 177–244 of the egf domain of HRGβ (hereafter referred to as residues 1–68) attached to the COOH terminus of the pIII gene. Phagemids displaying HRGβ mutants were produced by the addition of M13KO7 helper phage to XL1-Blue cells (Stratagene, Inc.) containing the mutated recombinant plasmid (17Cunningham B.C. Lowe D.G. Li B. Bennett B.D. Wells J.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2508-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Phagemid stocks were made by precipitating cell culture broths after 18–24 h growth with 20% PEG (8000), 2.5 m NaCl. Phagemids were resuspended in PBS (0.01 m sodium phosphate, 0.1m NaCl, pH 7.5). Microtiter plates (Nunc, Maxi-sorb 96-well) were coated overnight with 0.5 μg of rabbit anti-human IgG, Fc γ fragment-specific antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch) in 100 μl of 0.05 m NaCO3, pH 9.6, at 4 °C. Plates were blocked with PBS + 0.1% BSA, washed with PBS + 0.05% Tween 20 (wash buffer), then wells were coated with 0.1 or 0.05 μg of ErbB receptor-IgG in PBS + 0.1% BSA + 0.05% Tween 20 (binding buffer) for 1 h and washed again. Serial dilutions of receptor-IgG (competitor) and a concentration of phage, predetermined to give 60% saturation without competitor, were added to wells in 100 μl of binding buffer and incubated for 2 h to overnight at room temperature. Following incubation, plates were washed thoroughly, incubated with 1:900 dilution of anti-M13 horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Pharmacia) for 20 min. The level of phagemid bound was assayed using o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride substrate solution (Sigma). EC50 values were calculated with a 4-parameter fit equation and based on the concentration of soluble receptor-IgG needed to displace 50% of the phagemid from the plate. Assays on both receptors were carried out with the same phage preparation, on the same day. This served as a control of phage expression because numerous mutants showed little to no affinity for ErbB3, but good displacement curves could be generated for ErbB4 binding. Selected HRG mutants were expressed in a soluble form as Trx fusion proteins. The parent vector, pET23a (Novagen), was digested with NdeI andHindIII and Trx (bases 2722–3180, pTrxFus vector, Invitrogen) was inserted. HRGβ alanine mutants were initially generated by site-directed mutagenesis in the vector pRK5.gDhrgB1 (18Gorman C.M. Gies D.R. McCray G. DNA and Protein Eng. Techniques. 1990; 2: 2-10Google Scholar). To facilitate cloning of these mutants into the Trxcontaining vector, a KpnI site was engineered into the pRK5.gDhrgB1 vector immediately upstream of the NdeI site at position 5407. The modified parental HRG was cleaved from this vector and inserted at the carboxyl terminus of Trx at the KpnI andBamHI cloning sites. Subsequently, additional mutants were generated in pRK5.gDhrgB1, digested with NdeI andBamHI, and the resultant 313-base pair fragment was ligated in-frame to the carboxyl terminus of Trx. The vector also contains an enterokinase protease recognition site (DDDDK) between Trx and HRG. Trx-HRG expression was driven by an inducible T7 promoter. Cloning, cell growth, and expression were carried out as described in the Novagen pET system manual. Briefly, cloning was done in XL1-Blue cells and expression of soluble protein in BL21DE3 host cells. BL21DE3 cells containing the appropriate mutant plasmid were grown at 37 °C in LB medium until the OD550 reached 0.3–0.6, then protein was induced by 0.4 nmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and growth was allowed to continue for 2–4 h at 28 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 0.02 m Tris-HCl, 0.025m EDTA, pH 7.5 (1/20 cell culture volume). Cells were lysed by freezing on dry ice, thawing at 37 °C, and vigorous sonication. The freeze, thaw, and sonication cycle was repeated 3 times. Protein was further solubilized in 6 m guanidine HCl, 0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, then sulfitolized by the addition of 0.1 m Na2SO3 and 0.2 mNa2S4O6, and stirred at room temperature for 1.5 h. Protein was dialyzed into 0.05m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.01 m methionine. After dialysis, the insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 35,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were purified by Fast Flow Q Sepharose (Pharmacia) chromatography using a 15-ml column equilibrated with 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and protein was eluted by a NaCl gradient. The Trx-HRG mutants eluted between 0.5 and 0.6 m NaCl. Trx-HRG was refolded overnight at room temperature after addition of 1 mm cysteine. Finally, the protein was dialyzed into 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Each protein preparation was visualized on Coomassie-stained gels for purity and quantified by amino acid analysis. Trx-HRG protein was dialyzed into EKMax reaction buffer (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). EKMax enzyme was added to a final ratio of 0.5 units per 20 μg of protein and incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. EKMax was inactivated with soybean trypsin inhibitor resin (Sigma) for 2 h at room temperature. The cleavage products were purified by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography, then analyzed by mass spectrometry and protein sequence determination. One peak contained a product of approximately 9 kDa, this corresponded to a truncation at residue Lys55. Receptor-IgGs were coated on plates (Maxisorp C break apart strip wells, Nunc) as described for phage ELISA. Assays were carried out with a constant amount of 125I-labeled HRGβ1 (residues 1–68) and varied concentrations of unlabeled Trx-HRG fusion protein. Following incubation, plates were washed and bound radiolabeled HRG was counted on a γ-counter (Isodata). ErbB4-IgG assays were conducted in PBS, 1% BSA for blocking and fusion protein binding and PBS, 0.05% Tween 20 for washes. For the ErbB3-IgG assays, the wash buffer was TBST (0.025 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15m NaCl, 0.02% Tween 20), the blocking buffer was TBST, 1% BSA, and the binding buffer (RPMI binding buffer) used was RPMI 1640 cell culture medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.2, 0.2% BSA. K562 cells (ATCC) were stabily transfected with ErbB4 and propagated as described previously (19Zhang D. Sliwkowski M.X. Mark M. Frantz G. Akita R. Sun Y. Hillan K. Crowley C. Brush J. Godowski P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9562-9567Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Cells were treated 4 h to overnight with 10 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Calbiochem) prior to use. Cells (1 × 106/treatment) were stimulated with each HRG variant for 8 min. Cells were pelleted, supernatant withdrawn, and reaction stopped by addition of lysis buffer (0.025 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15m NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1% CHAPS, 200 nm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 units of apoprotinin, 10 μm leupeptin, 100 μm sodium orthovanadate, 100 μm sodium pyrophosphate). ErbB4 protein was immunoprecipited from the lysate with a mixture of 5 μg each of anti-ErbB4 monoclonal antibodies, 1459 and 1461, 4L. Bald, personal communication. and 20 μl of immobilized protein A/G (Ultralink Immobilized Protein A/G, Pierce). Following rotation at 4 °C overnight, the mixture was centrifuged, immobilized beads were washed with lysis buffer, spun again, and resuspended in reducing, SDS gel loading buffer. Material was boiled 5 min and the supernatant loaded on 4–12% Tris glycine gels (Novex). Protein was transferred from the gels to nitrocellulose and Western blotting done with chemiluminescence detection and following the manufacturer's instructions (ECD, Amersham). Blots were probed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Transduction Laboratories) at a dilution of 1:1000. Cells were cultured and pretreated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate as described above. Cells were plated in 96-well plates at density of 125,000 cells/well in final volume of 250 μl of RPMI binding buffer. Cells were incubated with varied concentrations of unlabeled Trx-HRG and a constant amount (200 pm) of 125I-labeled HRGβ. Following overnight incubation at 4 °C, cells were collected onto 0.45-μm polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Multiscreen-HV Filtration Plate, Millipore), washed 2 times with TBST, allowed to dry and the amount of bound radioactivity was measured. ErbB4 transfected K562 cells were grown to stationary phase in RPMI medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. Prior to stimulation, cells were placed in 0.1% fetal bovine serum containing medium. After 4 h, cells were washed with PBS, then stimulated with ligand for 12 min. Following stimulation, cells were lysed in reducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis running buffer. 2.5 × 105 cell equivalents were loaded per lane on 4–20% Tris glycine gels (Novex). Protein was transferred from the gels to nitrocellulose. Western blotting and detection were done following the manufacturer's instructions (ECD, Amersham). Activated MAPK was detected with an anti-active MAPK antibody (Promega) at a dilution of 1:20,000. The non-activated forms of ERK 1 and ERK 2 were detected with antibodies, each used at 1:2000 (Santa Cruz). Both proteins were detected with an anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody, used at 1:10,000 (Transduction Labs). This assay was conducted as described previously (20Sadick M.D. Sliwkowski M.X. Nuijens A. Bald L. Chiang N. Lofgren J.A. Wong W.L.T. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Every amino acid of the HRGβ (residues 1–53) egf domain, except for 6 cysteines and 2 alanines, was mutated to alanine (Fig. 1) and displayed monovalently on filamentous phage. Each alanine mutant displayed on phage was analyzed for binding to ErbB3 and ErbB4-IgGs in an ELISA format. The affinity of the phage displayed HRGβ was 13.6 ± 2.4 nm for ErbB3-IgG and 18.9 ± 5.4 nm for ErbB4-IgG, which was slightly weaker than HRGβ (1–68) binding to the two receptors (8.2 ± 1.0 nmfor ErbB3 and 14.8 ± 2.1 nm for ErbB4) under the same assay conditions. Overall, alanine substitutions in HRGβ caused greater reduction in binding to ErbB3 than ErbB4 (Fig. 2). Notably when residues His2 and Leu3 were changed to alanine, binding affinity for ErbB3 was dramatically reduced, yet there was virtually wild type affinity for ErbB4. These residues lie in the first β-strand of the major β-sheet. There were disruptions in binding for residues mutated in the helical region, particularly at position Phe13. Binding to ErbB3 and ErbB4 receptors was reduced in the region including the type I′ β-turn (Val15–Gly18) and in the area of the type I β-turn surrounding the 6th cysteine (Gly42–Cys45). Alanine substitutions throughout strand II of the major β-sheet and the Ω-loop (Phe21–Ser30) showed the least change in affinity for either receptor. Mutant K35A caused a significant reduction in binding for ErbB3 and ErbB4; this residue lies between the 4th and 5th cysteines. Loss of affinity was greater for ErbB4 compared with ErbB3, for two residues, Ser52 and Phe53. No residues beyond Phe53 were mutated in this study, because NMR studies showed that the COOH-terminal residues of HRGα, Met51-Tyr63, are disordered and flexible. A structural representation of the alanine scanning mutagenesis data is shown in Fig. 3, A andB. Loss of function of residues for binding ErbB3 and ErbB4 lie on both faces of the molecule. The two β-turns (Val15–Gly18 and Gly42–Gln46) were greatly affected by mutagenesis to alanine. There were affected hydrophobic residues, Leu3 and Val4, on the opposite surface from Arg44, as well as residues His2, Lys35, and Arg31. Individual mutants that had relatively large effects on binding to one or both receptors were selected for further analysis and characterization. Mutants were expressed as Trx fusion proteins, containing an additional 31 amino acids of HRGβ preceding theegf domain. There is an enterokinase cleavage site in the protein between Trx and HRG allowing for removal of the Trx fusion partner. Initial experiments showed that the fusion protein was able to bind to the receptors, although the affinity was somewhat reduced compared with HRGβ (1–68) on ErbB3 (TableI).Table IBinding affinities for HRG egf domain formsHRG formErbB3-IgG IC501-aMeasurements are average ± S.E. for at least three assays.ErbB4-IgG IC501-aMeasurements are average ± S.E. for at least three assays.nmHRGβ1-bCompeted from bound receptor with 125I-HRGβ.,1-cHRGβ, residues 1–68 or 177–244.8.2 ± 1.014.8 ± 2.1Trx-HRGβ1-bCompeted from bound receptor with 125I-HRGβ.,1-dTrx-HRGβ, HRG residues 146–244.50.4 ± 1.419.1 ± 2.2HRGβ1-bCompeted from bound receptor with 125I-HRGβ.,1-eHRGβ, HRG residues 146–231.26.5 ± 3.419.3 ± 4.8HRGβ-gIII1-fCompeted from bound receptor with soluble receptor-IgG.,1-gHRGβ-gIII, phage displayed HRG residues 177–244.13.6 ± 2.418.9 ± 5.41-a Measurements are average ± S.E. for at least three assays.1-b Competed from bound receptor with 125I-HRGβ.1-c HRGβ, residues 1–68 or 177–244.1-d Trx-HRGβ, HRG residues 146–244.1-e HRGβ, HRG residues 146–231.1-f Competed from bound receptor with soluble receptor-IgG.1-g HRGβ-gIII, phage displayed HRG residues 177–244. Open table in a new tab Binding data for the phage displayed and soluble mutants are shown in Table II. Mutants without significant loss of affinity compared with wild type were generally adequately measured in the phage format. If the loss in affinity was greater than 3-fold in the soluble format, it was often measured as a ratio of 100 (no detectable binding) in the phage system on ErbB3. While most mutant ratios were lower in the soluble format on ErbB3, F13A, V23A, F40A, R44A, and F53A, had a higher affinity ratio compared with the phage format. In particular, V23A gave inconsistent results when measured on phage, possibly due to inefficient expression (reviewed in Ref. 21Wells J.A. Lowman H.B. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 1992; 3: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Overall, the binding results were more consistent between the soluble and phage displayed proteins for ErbB4 compared with ErbB3. Many of the soluble ratios (11 of 20) were higher than phage ratios on ErbB4. Conversion of Arg44 to alanine had the most impact on binding of any single mutant. No displacement was evident at 8 μm for either ErbB3 or ErbB4 binding.Table IIBinding and phosphorylation analysis of HRG mutantsAlanine mutantErbB3ErbB4Phage HRG2-aIC50 mutant/IC50 wt, average of assay performed in duplicate on same day.Trx-HRG2-bIC50 mutant/IC50 Trx-HRG (wt), average of at least three separate assays.

(EC 2.4.1.145) is one of the essential enzymes in the synthesis of the multiantennary structure of Asn-linked sugar chains. It specifically generates the β1–4 linkage of GlcNAc to the α1–3 Man of the core structure ofN-glycans (Man3GlcNAc2). GnT-IV produces tetra-antennary structures in cooperation with GnT-V, which produces the β1–6 linkage of GlcNAc to the α1–6 Man of the core structure. This tetra-antennary structure is dominant in certain glycoproteins, such as erythropoietin (EPO) and α1-acid glycoprotein, and very important for their bioactivity (1Takeuchi M. Inoue N. Strickland T.W. Kubota M. Wada M. Shimizu R. Hoshi S. Kozutsumi H. Takasaki S. Kobata A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 7819-7822Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 2Boris P.N.

For instance, the in vivo biological activity of recombinant EPO has a positive correlation with the ratio of tetra-/biantennary sugar chains. Pharmacokinetics studies have shown that the bulky structure of the tetra-antennary branching prevents EPO from filtering out into the urine. The increase in the antenna number of α1-acid glycoprotein observed under a chronic inflammatory state or liver damage suggested that some clinical situations and/or cellular disorders may also affect the branch formation of sugar chains (3Mackiewicz A. Mackiewicz K. Glycoconj. J. 1995; 12: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). On the other hand, structural analyses of oligosaccharides in hepatoma cell lines and in choriocarcinoma have suggested that GnT-IV activity should be high in certain kinds of tumors (4Kobata A.

Due to the lack of data concerning GnT-IV, the mechanism of branch formation has not been fully clarified. Recently Oguri et al. (24Oguri S. Minowa M.T. Ihara Y. Taniguchi N. Ikenaga H. Takeuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22721-22727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) successfully purified and characterized GnT-IV from the bovine small intestine. In this report, we describe the amino acid sequencing of the purified GnT-IV enzyme and cDNA cloning of the bovine GnT-IV gene. We have also localized the catalytic domain of GnT-IV activity and examined its transcription level in a variety of bovine tissues. GnT-IV was purified from bovine small intestine as described in our previous report (24Oguri S. Minowa M.T. Ihara Y. Taniguchi N. Ikenaga H. Takeuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22721-22727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequences of protease-digested fragments of the enzyme were determined by Iwamatsu's method (25Iwamatsu A. Electrophoresis. 1992; 13: 142-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Briefly, after the second affinity column chromatography step, 300 pmol of the enzyme preparation was separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (ProBlott, Perkin-Elmer), the GnT-IV band was identified by staining with Ponceau S (Sigma) and cut out. The enzyme on the membrane was reduced and S-carboxymethylated to allow detection of Cys residues by the peptide sequencer. The peptide was then digested with the lysil endopeptidase Achromobacter protease I (Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka, Japan), and the fragments released (AP fragments) were collected. The peptide remaining on the membrane was further incubated with asparagil endopeptidase Asp-N (Boehringer Mannheim), and the digests (DN fragments) were collected. Each peptide fragment was separated by reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (Wakosil-II AR 5C18 2.0 × 150 mm, Wako Pure Chemicals) and analyzed with a gas-phase peptide sequencer (PPSQ-10, Shimadzu). To determine the N terminus of the purified bovine GnT-IV, 120 pmol of the final enzyme preparation, after the gel filtration, was directly analyzed by the peptide sequencer (24Oguri S. Minowa M.T. Ihara Y. Taniguchi N. Ikenaga H. Takeuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22721-22727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A bovine codon usage table was constructed using bovine open reading frames randomly selected from the GenBankTM data base. Only codons frequently used for bovine cDNA were adopted to design primers and probes to minimize the variation of primers and probes to be less than 10,000. The primers and probes were designed to be greater than 29- and 41-mer in length, respectively. Bovine small intestine mRNA was prepared by the guanidinium thiocyanate/CsCl method (26Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and a Poly(A) Quik mRNA isolation kit (Stratagene). Sense and antisense primers and probes were synthesized for the AP-5, AP-12, AP-15, and DN-9 peptide fragments (Table I). One of the possible combinations of the sense/antisense primers (50 pmol each) shown in Table I and 0.5 μg of poly(A)+ RNA were used for RT-PCR with an Access RT-PCR kit (Promega). The temperature cycle for RT-PCR was 48 °C for 45 min, 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 50 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 1 min, 68 °C for 2 min; and finally 68 °C for 7 min. Aliquots of the RT-PCR products were analyzed on 1% agarose gel by electrophoresis and were subjected to Southern analysis using probes (Table I) for the peptide sequence other than those used in RT-PCR. The RT-PCR fragments were then re-amplified with Taq polymerase (Stratagene) and subcloned into the pT7Blue T-Vector (Novagen).Table IOligonucleotides used for RT-PCR and construction of the expressed fusion proteinsPrimer and probe sequences for RT-PCR AP-5aNames of the peptides are underlined.Amino acidLys Ile His Val Asn Pro Pro Ala Glu Val Ser Thr Ala LeuPrimer (S)5′-AAR ATY CAY GTB AAY CCH CCH GCN GAR GT-3′Primer (AS)3′-TTY TAR GTR CAV TTR GGD GGD CGN CTY CA-5′Probe5′-AAG ATY CAC GTS AAC CCH CCH GCH GAG GTS WSY ACM GCH CT-3′ AP-12Amino acidLys Thr Asn Leu Asp Tyr Cys Phe Leu Met Met Tyr Ala Gln GluPrimer (S)5′-GAY TAY TGY TTY YTB ATG ATG TAY GCN CAG GA-3′Primer (AS)5′-CTR ATR ACR AAR GAV TAC TAC ATR CGN GTC CT-5′Probe5′-AAG ACM AAC CTS GAC TAC TGC TTY CTS ATG ATG TAC GCH CAG GAG-3′ AP-15Amino acid-Val Glu Ile Ile Ser Pro Pro Glu Ser Tyr Tyr Pro Asp Leu—Primer (S)5′-GAR ATY ATY WSY CCH CCH GAR WSY TAY TAY CC-3′Primer (AS)3′-CTY TAR TAR WSR GGD GGD CTY WSR ATR ATR GG-5′Probe5′-GTS GAG ATY ATY WSY CCH CCH GAG WSY TAC TAC CCH GAC CT-3′ DN-9Amino acidAsp Lys Pro Val Asn Val Glu Ser Tyr Leu Phe His Ser Gly AsnPrimer (S)5′-GAY AAR CCH GTB AAY GTB GAR WSY TAY TTB TTY CA-3′Primer (AS)3′-CTR TTY GGD CAV TTR CAV CTY WSR ATR GAV AAR GT-5′Probe5′-GAC AAG CCH GTS AAC GTS GAG WSY TAC CTS TTY CAC WSY GGV AAC-3′Three junction amino acid sequences of erythropoietin signal sequence and truncated GnT-IV Junction sequence 1-LeuProValLeuGlyAlaProIleLeuLysGluLeuThrSerLysLys-↲ Junction sequence 2-LeuProValLeuGlyAlaProHisLeuLeuGlnAsnGluGlySer-↲ Junction sequence 3-LeuProValLeuGlyAlaProTyrValLysArgGluValLys-↲a Names of the peptides are underlined. Open table in a new tab The cDNA fragment amplified with the AP-5 sense primer and the DN-9 antisense primer (Fig. 1, Probe 1) was used to screen the bovine small intestine cDNA library (CLONTECH). The probe was 32P-labeled using a PCR radioactive labeling system (Life Technologies, Inc.). A fragment of approximately 150 bp of the 5′-end of phage clone #1e (Fig.1, Probe 2) was amplified for labeling and used for the second screening. A similar procedure was carried out using the phage clone #2a sequence (Fig. 1, Probe 3) for the third screening. The insert fragment of each phage was amplified with Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) or Taq polymerase and subcloned into the pCR-Script Amp SK(+) vector (Stratagene) or pT7Blue T-Vector for nucleotide sequencing. Dye Primer and Dye Terminator cycle sequencing kits (Perkin-Elmer) and an ABI sequencer model 377 (Perkin-Elmer) were used for DNA sequencing. 5′-RACE was carried out by a modification of a published method (27Frohman M.A. Dush M.K. Martin G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8998-9002Crossref PubMed Scopus (4336) Google Scholar). Bovine small intestine poly(A)+ RNA was reverse-transcribed with RRT1 primer (5′-TATTGAAACTCCTGTTCGTCCATTTCCGAT-3′), and a poly(dA) tail was added with terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (Stratagene). The products were subjected to PCR using Pfu polymerase and three primers: RPCR1 (5′-CTGCACGGCAGGTTGAAGGCTTCCT-3′) as the antisense primer (50 pmol); adaptor (50 pmol), 5′-GCCGCATGCGAATTCACC-3′; and adaptor-(dT)17 (6 pmol). PCR was set at 94 °C for 5 min followed by 20 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min; 20 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min; and finally 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products were purified twice with Centricon 100 (Amicon) to remove any excess primers and were then cloned into the pCR-Script Amp SK(+) vector. This library was screened with Probe 3 (Fig. 1) by colony hybridization. The second 5′-RACE was performed based on the DNA sequence of the clone resulting from the first 5′-RACE. Primer sequences were RRT2 (5′-AATTGCTGTACAATGGCACTGAGCTCAGA-3′) for reverse transcription and RPCR2 (5′-AGAGCGCTGAGAGATTCGA-3′) for PCR. The library of the second 5′-RACE clones was screened with Probe 4 (Fig.1). AnEco47III-HpaI fragment of the 5′-RACE clone #3a, a HpaI-BstXI fragment of phage clone #2a, and aBstXI-KpnI (in vector) fragment of #1a phage insert cloned in the pT7Blue T-Vector were sequentially ligated between the Eco47III and KpnI (in vector) sites of the 5′-RACE clone #4a in the pCR-Script Amp SK(+) vector. The resultant plasmid, pCRBGT4, was used as a template for the following PCR experiments to make the various expression vectors (Fig. 1). The entire open reading frame of bovine GnT-IV was amplified with primers 4EXPF2 (introducing an XhoI site upstream of the ATG codon) and 4EXPR (introducing an XbaI site downstream of the stop codon), digested with XhoI and XbaI, and cloned into the pSVL vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to produce the expression vector pBGT4. Expression vectors with serial N-terminal deletions ligated to the EPO signal sequence (28Jacobs K. Shoemaker C. Rubersdorf R. Neill S.D. Kaufman R.J. Mufson A. Seehra J. Jones S.S. Hewick R. Fritsch E.F. Kawakita M. Shimizu T. Miyake T. Nature (London). 1985; 313: 806-810Crossref PubMed Scopus (850) Google Scholar) were constructed by overlapping PCR as follows: a cDNA fragment encoding the EPO signal sequence was amplified with the XhoEsig primer (introducing anXhoI site upstream of the ATG codon of the EPO signal sequence) and an antisense primer encoding junction sequence 1 (TableI). On the other hand, the GnT-IV segment was amplified with a sense primer for junction sequence 1 and the 4EXPR primer. Aliquots of both PCR products were combined and amplified again with the primers XhoEsig and 4EXPR. The final PCR product was digested with XhoI andXbaI and cloned into pSVL, resulting in pSigIle93. Similar procedures were employed for junction sequences 2 and 3, resulting in pSigPro113 and pSigPro142, respectively. Serial C-terminal deletion was carried out by PCR using the 4EXPF2 primer in combination with a primer with a TGA codon and an XbaI restriction site following the GnT-IV coding region terminating at Gly-499, Pro-465, Lys-432, or Pro-383. The amplified fragments were subcloned into pSVL, giving rise to expression plasmids pCGly499, pCPro465, pCLys432, and pCPro383, respectively. Codons for Ser-79 and Thr-460 were changed into Ala codons by PCR (AGT to GCT and ACG to GCG, respectively) to abolish potential N-glycosylation sites at Asn-77 and Asn-458, respectively. All constructs (Fig. 4) used for transient expression were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The GnT-IV assay was performed according to the method of Oguri et al. (24Oguri S. Minowa M.T. Ihara Y. Taniguchi N. Ikenaga H. Takeuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22721-22727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), which is a modification of the method of Nishikawa et al.(29Nishikawa A. Gu J. Fujii S. Taniguchi N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1035: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The substrate Gn2(2′,2)core-PA was prepared as reported previously (30Tokugawa K. Oguri S. Takeuchi M. Glycoconj. J. 1996; 13: 53-56Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). 10 μg of each expression plasmid was incorporated into 5 × 106 of COS-7 cells in 0.8 ml of phosphate-buffered saline by electroporation using a Gene Pulser (Bio-Rad) and conditions of 1,600 V, 25 μF at room temperature. After 72 h of cultivation in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C, the cells were collected, suspended in 100 μl of buffer (5 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and disrupted by sonication. The supernatants were collected by centrifugation at 2,000 × g for 5 min and used to measure GnT-IV activity. The GnT-IV activity of each lysate was normalized to its protein concentration to reflect the cell number. RT-PCR was performed with poly(A)+ RNA from various bovine tissues and the b1NPF (5′-CCATAGTGGCAACCAGGATCATC-3′) and b1NPR (5′-CGAAATGGGGTTTAGGCTGG-3′) primers. 25 pmol of each primer was used in a 25-μl reaction using an Access RT-PCR kit. The mRNA level was reduced until the difference in the amplified fragments among the various tissues became obvious. The temperature cycle employed was 48 °C for 45 min, 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 57 °C for 1 min, 68 °C for 2 min; and finally 68 °C for 7 min. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase mRNA was amplified with primers, 5′-CCAAAATCAAGTGGGGCGATG-3′ and 5′-CAGGAGGCATTGCTGATGATCTTG-3′ as a control. Poly(A)+ RNA from bovine small intestine was purified as described above. Poly(A)+ RNAs from other tissues were purchased from CLONTECH. Using 300 pmol of the purified GnT-IV preparation, we obtained 31 peptide fractions (16 fromAchromobacter protease I digestion and 15 from the following Asp-N treatment). Twenty of the fragments (7 from the former and 13 from the latter treatment) were subjected to peptide sequencing, and 24 peptide sequences were obtained, since some fractions gave mixed signals. Four peptide sequences were identified as being fragments derived from the bovine IgG heavy chain, whereas the others were novel. We also determined the amino acid sequence of the N terminus of GnT-IV prepared free of IgG fragments as NH2-Ile-Leu-Lys-Glu-. We performed RT-PCR using bovine small intestine poly(A)+ RNA as a template and primers corresponding to four novel amino acid sequences, as shown in TableI and Fig. 2. A 0.2-kilobase fragment amplified with the AP-5 sense primer and the DN-9 antisense primer (Table I) was cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequence encoded by this cDNA included four other peptide fragments that were not employed in the RT-PCR strategy, indicating that this amplified fragment is part of the GnT-IV cDNA and could be used for screening of the cDNA library (Fig.1, Probe 1). The nucleotide sequences of five independent clones (Fig. 1, φ#1a to 1e) from the first screening showed that they shared the 3′-terminal portion of GnT-IV coding region (Fig. 1). We could not obtain the initiation codon by the second and third screenings using the 5′-terminal region of the #1e and #2a phage inserts (Fig. 1, Probe 2 and 3, respectively). Thus, we performed 5′-RACE to obtain the 5′-portion of the open reading frame. After two cycles of experiments, the complete open reading frame was obtained (Figs. 1 and2). The 2,246-bp cDNA fragment obtained (Fig. 2) consisted of a 1,605-bp open reading frame, 287 bp upstream and 354 bp downstream regions. The first methionine codon at 288–290 (Fig. 2) is considered to be the only initiation site, since no other in frame methionine codon was found, and the nucleotide sequence around 288–290 is partially consistent with Kozak's rule (31Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 5233-5262Crossref PubMed Scopus (829) Google Scholar). Neither a poly(A) tail nor the AATAAA polyadenylation initiation signal was found within the 3′-untranslated region obtained. The polypeptide deduced from this open reading frame consists of 535 amino acids (Fig. 2) and is expected to be 61,613 Da. 19 of the novel peptide sequences obtained from the purified bovine GnT-IV appeared in this open reading frame (Fig. 2). N-terminal sequence analysis of the purified GnT-IV revealed that most of the enzyme was truncated at Ile-93, indicating proteolysis during enzyme purification; heterogeneity of the end was observed. Hydrophobicity and the surface probability profile showed that an 18-amino acid (position 8–25) region close to the N terminus could be a transmembrane domain, suggesting that GnT-IV is a typical type II membrane protein (Fig.3). Potential N-glycosylation sites (Asn-Xaa(except Pro)-Ser/Thr) were found at Asn-5, -77, and -458, whereas O-glycosylation motif preferred by bovineO-GalNAcT1 (Thr/Ser-Pro-Xaa-Pro or Thr-Xaa-Xaa-Pro) (32Yoshida A. Suzuki M. Ikenaga H. Takeuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16884-16888Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) was not found. The entire open reading frame in the pSVL vector was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells. The transfected cells showed a >50-fold increase in in vitroGnT-IV activity (Fig. 4, pBGT4). N-terminal deletion up to Ile-93 (pSigIle93), which is identical to the purified bovine GnT-IV, still expressed GnT-IV activity and the truncated enzyme could be secreted using the EPO signal sequence. On the other hand, deletions up to Pro-113 (pSigPro113) and Pro-142 (pSigPro142) abolished GnT-IV activity. We also have expressed serial deletion mutants at the C terminus of GnT-IV in COS-7 cells. Contrary to our expectation, pCPro383, which had the largest deletion of all the C-terminal deletion mutants, maintained complete GnT-IV activity in vitro (Fig. 4). Although we did not make further deletions in the C-terminal portion, from these two deletion experiments, we concluded that the catalytic domain of bovine GnT-IV must be located between Ile-93 and Pro-383. Amino acid substitutions of Ser-79 and Thr-460 with Ala, which disrupted the consensus sequence of N-glycosylation at Asn-77 and Asn-458, respectively, did not significantly reduce GnT-IV activity (Fig. 4, pS79A and pT460A). We performed RT-PCR using poly(A)+ RNA to compare GnT-IV mRNA abundance between various bovine tissues (Fig.5). The amount of amplified bands differed between tissues. Small intestine, kidney, lung, and spleen gave strong signals for GnT-IV mRNA, whereas brain, heart, and liver produced faint signals. We have isolated a cDNA fragment containing the entire open reading frame for bovine GnT-IV based on the amino acid sequences of the purified bovine enzyme. The open reading frame of 535 amino acids within the cDNA fragment obtained was confirmed to encode GnT-IV by two methods: 1) it contained 19 of the 20 novel peptide sequences of the bovine GnT-IV preparation (Fig. 2); 2) it conveyed GnT-IV activityin vitro by transient expression in COS-7 cells (Fig.4). Comparison of the amino acid sequence of bovine GnT-IV with those of other GnTs revealed no obvious homology, whereas all GnTs including GnT-IV shared a type II transmembrane protein structure. The region between the end of the transmembrane domain of GnT-IV and Ile-93 is rather hydrophilic (Fig. 3) and flexible, suggesting that this region could be the stem region. In addition, the protease lability of this sequence also suggested that this region was exposed. Although many other glycosyltransferases carry proline-rich sequences in the stem region (10Sarkar M. Hull E. Nishikawa Y. Simpson R.J. Moritz R.L. Dunn R. Schachter H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 234-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 17Nishikawa A. Ihara Y. Hatakeyama M.

The purified GnT-IV had N-glycan(s), because it was sensitive to N-glycosidase digestion (24Oguri S. Minowa M.T. Ihara Y. Taniguchi N. Ikenaga H. Takeuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22721-22727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). There are three potential N-glycosylation sites, Asn-5, Asn-77, and Asn-458; however, the purified enzyme had lost Asn-5 and Asn-77. Therefore, Asn-458 is the only N-glycosylation site in the truncated GnT-IV. Indeed, no amino acid could be detected at the Asn-458 position in peptide sequencing, indicating that this residue might be modified (data not shown). Taking all evidence together, it was concluded that the purified GnT-IV had one Asn-linked oligosaccharide at Asn-458, although this sugar chain was not essential for GnT-IV activity (Fig.4). It is possible that Asn-5 is not N-glycosylated, because it is presumably located on the cytosol side. There is no evidence to suggest the glycosylation state of Asn-77. During purification of GnT-IV from bovine small intestine, we added protease inhibitors in the complete procedure to avoid proteolysis. Nevertheless, the GnT-IV thus obtained appeared to be truncated at Ile-93. The calculated molecular weight of the polypeptide extending from Ile-93 was 51,000. The difference in molecular weight between the deduced peptide above and the estimated size of the purified enzyme obtained by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (58,000; Ref. 24Oguri S.

Chem. 1997; 272: 22721-22727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) was much larger than the molecular weight of one Asn-linked oligosaccharide. This might indicate a maturation procedure other thanN-glycosylation. Limited proteolysis during purification has also been observed for other glycosyltransferases (10Sarkar M. Hull E. Nishikawa Y.

N- and C-terminal deletion experiments indicated that the region bearing in vitro GnT-IV activity was between Ile-93 and Pro-383. This region had many lysines that might be involved in UDP binding (35Yadav S. Brew K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14163-14169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kazuta Y. Tanizawa K.

So far, there is little data regarding the tertiary structures of GnTs, and the substrate binding site has not been specified. Although all GnTs share the common donor substrate, UDP-GlcNAc, there is no consensus motif in their amino acid sequences. Indeed, the GnTs purified so far have quite differentK m values for UDP-GlcNAc (0.04 mm for GnT-I, 0.96 mm for GnT-II, 3.1 mm for GnT-III, 0.22 mm for GnT-IV 2S. Oguri, M. T. Minowa, Y. Ihara, N.

Therefore, it is possible that each enzyme has a different means of binding the donor substrate. We would like to elucidate the structure and function of GnT-IV and compare this data with other GnTs when available. Our attempt to produce soluble forms of GnT-IV showed that the replacement of the transmembrane and stem regions with the EPO signal sequence was not enough for full secretion (Fig. 4, pSigIle93). There might be a signal located between Ile-93 and the C terminus of GnT-IV to retain the protein within the cell, although such signals are usually considered to lie within the transmembrane domain and nearby regions (40Matsuoka Y.

Currently, we are attempting to raise antibody against GnT-IV, which would help to determine the localization of GnT-IV in recombinant cells, as well as naturally occurring cells and tissues. Partial information regarding the intron/exon organization was obtained from the 5′-RACE experiments. A total of three 5′-RACE clones was obtained containing different cDNA fragments. The 5′-RACE clones #3a and #4b had gaps in their cDNA from residues 61 to 381 and 61 to 185, respectively (Figs. 1 and 2). On the other hand clone #4a had a continuous segment starting from residue 34. Complementary DNA sequences preceding the ends of the gaps in clones #3a and #4b were both similar to the consensus sequence of the intron acceptors (44Mount S.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 459-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (2784) Google Scholar). Comparison between a bovine partial genomic clone and the cDNA segments obtained revealed that there were at least three introns in the GnT-IV genomic DNA corresponding to 1–550 bp of the cDNA sequence and the splicing variation had occurred in this region (data not shown). GnT-I and -II are encoded as single exons, whereas GnT-III and -V have complex genomic organizations (11Hull E. Sarkar M. Spruijt M.P.N. Hoppener J.W.M. Dunn R. Schachter H. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

GnT-IV could have many exons/introns, and this might be a common feature of genomic DNAs encoding branch-forming enzymes forN-glycans. We analyzed the expression level of GnT-IV in various bovine tissues by RT-PCR. The result showed different levels of GnT-IV mRNA in these tissues, indicating that GnT-IV expression is regulated. The small intestine, which was used as a source of mRNA for cloning as well as being the source of enzyme for purification, produced a strong GnT-IV mRNA signal. The spleen also gave a strong signal, which was coincident with its high GnT-IV activity,2 whereas the heart, which had an undetectable level of activity,2produced a weak signal. The tissue specific expression pattern of GnT-IV may suggest the importance and role of the β1–4 GlcNAc branch in certain cellular functions. The branching structure ofN-glycans could be, in part, controlled by the relative activities of the various enzymes involved in branch formation, such as GnT-III, -IV, -V, and β1–4 galactosyltransferase. A bisecting GlcNAc produced by GnT-III and a galactose residue attached to either of two β1–2 GlcNAcs inhibited GnT-IV action, whereas the β1–6 GlcNAc at the α1–6 mannose, which is a product of GnT-V, enhanced GnT-IV activity (24Oguri S. Minowa M.T. Ihara Y. Taniguchi N. Ikenaga H. Takeuchi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22721-22727Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that the increase of the antenna number of Asn-linked sugar chains in certain cell lines and tumor tissues is mainly due to the elevation of GnT-V activity (45Pierce M. Arango J. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 10772-10777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 46Hubbard S.C. J. Biol.

Since GnT-IV activity is also essential to produce tetra-antennary structure, its increase together with GnT-V could contribute to cellular changes that require GnT-IV product specifically. There was no method for the detection of the GnT-IV enzyme immunologically or its product of the β1–4 GlcNAc branch at the α1–3 Man. This could be one reason that the role of GnT-IV in a variety of phenomena is not well understood. Using the GnT-IV cDNA reported here, it became possible to evaluate the expression level of GnT-IV. Using the cDNAs of all the GnTs and β1–4 galactosyltransferase involved in N-glycan branch formation it will be possible to compare the expression levels of the GnTs to clarify the control of branching. Overexpression and/or suppression of these enzymes will provide tools for producing glycoproteins with targeted antennary sugar chain structures. Also, an enzymatic approach will now be available to elucidate the factors that determine the branch formation of N-glycans using the recombinant GnT-I–V enzymes. Moreover, these recombinant enzymes will be very useful to remodel the branch structure of N-glycans attached to glycoproteins to see if they alter the biological properties of the proteins. We are very grateful to Prof. Naoyuki Taniguchi (Osaka Univ.) for helpful discussions. We also thank Dr. Shinji Takamatsu (KIRIN Brewery) for critical reading of this manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W2018709247,"The sequence 5′-rUUGGCG-3′ is conserved within the loop regions of antisense RNAs or their targets involved in replication of various prokaryotic plasmids. In IncIα plasmid ColIb-P9, the partially base paired 21-nucleotide loop of a stem-loop called structure I within RepZ mRNA contains this hexanucleotide sequence, and comprises the target site for the antisense Inc RNA. In this report, we find that the base pairing interaction at the 5′-rGGC-3′ sequence in the hexanucleotide motif is important for interaction between Inc RNA and structure I. In addition, the 21-base loop domain of structure I is folded tighter than predicted, with the hexanucleotide sequence at the top. The second U residue in the sequence is favored for Inc RNA binding in a base-specific manner. On the other hand, the upper domain of the Inc RNA stem-loop is loosely structured, and maintaining the loop sequence single-stranded is important for the intermolecular interaction. Based on these results, we propose that a structural feature in the loop I domain, conferred probably by the conserved 5′-rUUGGCG-3′ sequence, favors binding to a complementary, single-stranded RNA. This model also explains how the RepZ mRNA pseudoknot, described in the accompanying paper (Asano, K., and Mizobuchi, K. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 11815-11825) is formed specifically with structure I. A possible conformation adopted by the 5′-rUUGGCG-3′ loop sequence is discussed. The sequence 5′-rUUGGCG-3′ is conserved within the loop regions of antisense RNAs or their targets involved in replication of various prokaryotic plasmids. In IncIα plasmid ColIb-P9, the partially base paired 21-nucleotide loop of a stem-loop called structure I within RepZ mRNA contains this hexanucleotide sequence, and comprises the target site for the antisense Inc RNA. In this report, we find that the base pairing interaction at the 5′-rGGC-3′ sequence in the hexanucleotide motif is important for interaction between Inc RNA and structure I.

Based on these results, we propose that a structural feature in the loop I domain, conferred probably by the conserved 5′-rUUGGCG-3′ sequence, favors binding to a complementary, single-stranded RNA. This model also explains how the RepZ mRNA pseudoknot, described in the accompanying paper (Asano, K., and Mizobuchi, K. (1998) J. Biol. Chem. 273, 11815-11825) is formed specifically with structure I. A possible conformation adopted by the 5′-rUUGGCG-3′ loop sequence is discussed. In prokaryotes, small antisense RNAs, encoded by the antisense strand of the transcribed leader region, negatively control the expression of many genes at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level, or the formation of primers for plasmid DNA replication (for review, see Refs. 1Eguchi Y. Itoh T. Tomizawa J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 631-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar and 2Wagner E.G.H. Simons R.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 713-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). In ColE1 and related plasmids, the antisense RNA I and its target on the pre-primer RNA II each comprise three small stem-loop structures with 6 to 7 base loops complementary to each other, and a transient interaction between these loops is rate-limiting for interaction between RNAs I and II (1Eguchi Y. Itoh T. Tomizawa J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 631-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). The replication of low-copy number IncFII, IncB, and IncIα group plasmids is also negatively controlled by antisense RNAs, which in these cases bind to the complementary regions in the transcribed leader sequences of the genes encoding replication initiator proteins (1Eguchi Y. Itoh T. Tomizawa J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 631-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 2Wagner E.G.H. Simons R.W. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1994; 48: 713-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Antisense and target RNAs of these plasmids essentially carry only one stem-loop structure. The sequence 5′-rUUGGCG-3′ is conserved within the loop regions of the target RNA (3Couturier M. Bex F. Bergquist P.L. Maas W.K. Microbiol. Rev. 1988; 52: 375-395Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Besides these plasmids, the same hexanucleotide sequence is found in the loop of the ColE2 antisense RNA I which controls the replication of this high-copy number plasmid (4Sugiyama T. Itoh T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5972-5977Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), and a similar 5′-rUUCGCG-3′ is located in the loop of the antisense RNA-OUT, which controls translation of the Tn10 transposase (5Kittle J.D. Simons R.W. Lee J. Kleckner N. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 210: 561-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In all of these cases so far analyzed, base pairing interaction between the two complementary RNA molecules at the G/C-rich segment of 3 or 4 bases within the conserved hexanucleotide sequence is rate-limiting for the intermolecular interaction (4Sugiyama T. Itoh T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5972-5977Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 5Kittle J.D. Simons R.W. Lee J. Kleckner N. J. Mol.

In IncIα plasmid ColIb-P9, it is predicted that both the antisense Inc RNA and its target, structure I, within the RepZ mRNA leader region are folded into a single large stem-loop with the size of 51 bases (7Hama C. Takizawa T. Moriwaki H. Urasaki Y. Mizobuchi K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1983-1991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Shiba K. Mizobuchi K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1992-1997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both of these stem-loops are divided into two domains: the bottom contiguous stem of 15 base pairs, and the large partially base paired loop of 21 bases (Fig. 1). Structure I of RepZ mRNA contains the conserved 5′-rUUGGCG-3′ sequence at the top of the upper loop domain at positions 325–330 (boxed by dotted line in Fig. 1). Four single base substitutions in each nucleotide of the 5′-rGCCA-3′ sequence of Inc RNA (positions 329′ 1We added a prime to the ColIb-P9 coordinate in the complementary strand. 1We added a prime to the ColIb-P9 coordinate in the complementary strand. to 326′, shown byarrowheads in Fig. 1) reduce the ability to repressrepZ translation, suggesting that base pairing interaction at the conserved sequence is again important for interaction between the antisense and the target RNAs in the ColIb-P9 system (9Asano K. Kato A. Moriwaki H. Hama C. Shiba K. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3774-3781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, it is at this 5′-rUUGGCG-3′ site that the RepZ mRNA pseudoknot required for repZ translation is formed with the 5′-rCGCC-3′ sequence separated by 107 bases at positions 437–440 (Refs. 9Asano K. Kato A. Moriwaki H. Hama C. Shiba K. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3774-3781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Asano K. Moriwaki H. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 11815-11825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar; also see Fig. 1). These observations have strengthened the importance of this conserved loop sequence for RNA-RNA base pairing interactions, and suggested to us that the positive and negative regulatory elements for repZ gene expression (the RepZ mRNA pseudoknot and Inc RNA) function in a competitive manner. In this report, we extended our analyses into interaction between Inc RNA and the structure I of RepZ mRNA. Our studies not only suggest the importance of the conserved 5′-rUUGGCG-3′ sequence in structure I for stimulating binding of a complementary, single-stranded RNA, but also explain how the RepZ mRNA pseudoknot, described in the accompanying paper (11Asano K. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11815-11825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), is formed specifically with structure I. Evidence is also presented suggesting that the formation of RepZ mRNA pseudoknot and the binding of Inc RNA are mutually exclusive events in vitro and function competitively in vivo.

Urasaki Y. Mizobuchi K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1983-1991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was found to carry a moderate copy-up mutation, C334A, we re-screened copy-up mutants using the same scheme with the wild-type λ:ColIb-P9 hybrid phage, λCH10W. Clear-plaque forming mutants of λCH10W plated on W3110λind − were isolated at a frequency of 6 × 10−7, and purified. Among 12 independent mutants, six carried a base substitution in theinc gene promoter. We located two A400C (inc1) and two A400G mutations in the −35 region, and one T376C and one A372G mutations in the −10 region. Five other mutations represented as λW1 changed T-325 in the inc loop to C (T325C), and still another had an insertion of A between positions 398 and 399. This mutation fuses repY to repZ in-frame, and also affected the inc gene promoter. We used λW1 carrying a newinc loop mutation for further study. MC1061 cells carrying each 4.3-kilobase mini-ColIb-P9 plasmid were grown exponentially toA 600 of 0.40 at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with kanamycin (40 μg/ml). Plasmid DNA was isolated according to Birnboim and Doly (21Birnboim H.C. Doly J. Nucl. Acids Res. 1979; 7: 1513-1523Crossref PubMed Scopus (9838) Google Scholar). After the cells were suspended in solution II, 1.2 μg of pKA140-I2 with a size of 11 kilobases (9Asano K. Kato A. Moriwaki H. Hama C. Shiba K. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol.

A portion of DNA samples was linearized by digestion with BstP1 which cleaves both mini ColIb-P9 and pKA140-I2 uniquely, and electrophoresed on a 0.7% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide. The gel was photographed under UV light. The negative was scanned by Shimadzu CS930 spectrophotometer. MC1061 cells carrying the wild-type or mutant pKA340-W3 and pACYC184, pKA18, or its mutant derivative were grown in the presence of kanamycin (40 μg/ml) and chloramphenicol (50 μg/ml) and assayed for β-galactosidase activity as described (9Asano K. Kato A. Moriwaki H. Hama C. Shiba K. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3774-3781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific activity of the enzyme was expressed as Miller units (22Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). The values reported here are the results of at least three independent experiments, and the standard deviations were within 15% of each value. Mutant derivatives of the RepZ mRNA leader region were synthesized using T7 RNA polymerase essentially as described (11Asano K. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11815-11825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Unlabeled RNA293 was prepared from the same reaction mixture except that 2 mm GTP replaced 0.5 mm GTP, and that 0.222 MBq of [5,6-3H]UTP (1000 GBq/mmol) was used instead of [γ-32P]GTP for quantitation. 5′-32P-RNA120 was prepared withEcoO109I-digested pKA10 as the template. Mutant derivatives of these RNAs were synthesized using respective mutant derivatives of pKA10. 32P-Labeled Inc RNA was synthesized using the supercoiled pKA10 DNA as a template and E. coli RNA polymerase. The reaction mixture of 50 μl contained 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.02 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 500 mm each of ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP, 2.96 MBq of [α-32P]UTP (222 TBq/mmol), 40 units of RNase inhibitor (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto), 6 units of E. coli RNA polymerase (Boehringer Manheim), and 5 μg of plasmid DNA. Inc RNA labeled with 32P at the 5′ end was synthesized in the same reaction mixture (total of 80 μl) as for uniformly labeled ones except for 300 μm cold GTP and 3.7 MBq of [γ-32P]GTP (222 TBq/mmol) instead of 500 μm cold GTP and 2.96 MBq of [α-32P]UTP (222 TBq/mmol). For mutant derivatives of 32P-Inc RNA (both 5′-labeled and uniformly labeled), we used mutant derivatives of pKA10 as the template. All the radioactive materials were purchased from New England Nuclear Research Products. These RNAs were gel-purified (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and suspended in the standard binding buffer of Tomizawa (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl) (24Tomizawa J. Cell. 1984; 38: 861-870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Concentrations were determined by scintillation counting. Binding rate constants between Inc RNA and RepZ mRNAs were determined in the standard binding buffer as described (24Tomizawa J. Cell. 1984; 38: 861-870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) with slight modification. 2.5 × 10−10 to 1 × 10−9m of uniformly 32P-labeled Inc RNA was incubated with 2.5 × 10−9-10−7m unlabeled RNA293 in the binding buffer at 37 °C. Molar concentrations of RNA293 were always more than 10 times higher than those of 32P-Inc RNA. Aliquots were withdrawn at various times and mixed with an equal volume of an ice-cold solution (95% formamide, 0.1% xylane cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 17 mm EDTA). Reactions were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 8.3 m urea in TBE buffer (23Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Autoradiography was at −70 °C with a Kodak X-AR5 film. The 5′ 32P-labeled Inc RNAs and RNAs120 (0.06 μg/reaction) were subjected to secondary structure analysis by RNase T1, RNase derived from Bacillus cereus, RNase Bc, or RNase V1 as described (11Asano K. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11815-11825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Mutations changing each base of the 5′-UUGGCG-3′ sequence (positions 325–330), as shown in Fig.1, were isolated spontaneously or introduced by site-directed mutagenesis (see “Experimental Procedures” and Ref. 11Asano K. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11815-11825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We employed mutations C334A and G331A since they are expected to disrupt the internal base pairing within the loop domains of structure I and Inc RNA. C334A was found fortuitously during the construction of a mini-ColIb-P9 plasmid, pCH10. C334A and C329T were moderate copy-up mutations increasing copy number 9- and 5-fold compared with wild-type, respectively. 2K. Asano and K. Mizobuchi, manuscript in preparation. T325C was found in a clear plaque-forming mutant, designated λW1, derived from the λ:ColIb-P9 hybrid phage, λCH10W (see “Experimental Procedures”). Copy number of the ColIb-P9 replicon excised from λW1 was increased 36-fold compared with wild-type (data not shown).repZ expression was increased 75-fold by T325C when measured by β-galactosidase activity with a repZ-lacZ translational fusion carried by pKA140-W1 in high copy (data not shown). In contrast to these three copy-up mutations, rep2006 (G327A), G328A, and rep2041 (G330A) impair replication due to a failure to form the pseudoknot required for repZ expression (9Asano K. Kato A. Moriwaki H. Hama C. Shiba K. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3774-3781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Asano K. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11815-11825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). G331A also reduced the level of repZ expression significantly in the absence of Inc RNA (9Asano K. Kato A. Moriwaki H. Hama C. Shiba K. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3774-3781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Asano K. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11815-11825Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To analyze effects of inc loop mutations on negative control of repZ expression without affecting positive control, the repZ-lacZ reporter plasmids and Inc RNA donor plasmids were constructed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The reporter plasmids, pKA340-W3 and its mutant derivatives, carry the inc1 mutation to eliminate production of endogenous Inc RNA. In addition, formation of the pseudoknot required for repZ translation was maintained in the reporters by introducing base changes in the 5′-TCCGCCA-3′ sequence at positions 435–441 that compensate for the inc target mutations in structure I, e.g. sup2006–10 (C440T) forrep2006 (G327A) (9Asano K. Kato A. Moriwaki H. Hama C. Shiba K. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3774-3781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in TableII, the level of repZexpression from the reporter plasmids with different Inc RNA target sites (pKA340-W3 derivatives) are between 706 and 2177 units due to these secondary mutations in the absence of inc encoded on the donor plasmid (vector alone, pACYC184) (Table II, the first line in each mutant subset). This level of expression is comparable to 1978 units from pKA340-W3 encoding wild-type structure I (Table II, line 1, column 5).Table IIEffect of mutations in the inc gene region on repZ gene expressionMutationPlasmid used2-aNucleotide in RepZ mRNA or Inc RNA at the relevant position is shown in parentheses for recipient reporter or Inc RNA donor plasmid, respectively.

Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Open table in a new tab To examine the effect of different mutant Inc RNAs on repZexpression, the vector pACYC184 was replaced with pKA18 or its mutant derivatives encoding wild-type or mutant Inc RNAs, respectively. As shown in Table II, each of the reporter constructs exhibitedrepZ expression ranging from 1.2 to 42 units in the presence of the mutant Inc RNA with the complementary substitution (Table II, the second line in each mutant subset). As these values are significantly higher than 0.3 unit from the wild-type combination (line 2, column 5), we concluded that all the mutations employed here affected the action of Inc RNA, even though the two interacting RNA molecules are complementary to each other. Next, we replaced either the recipient or donor plasmid with a wild-type one. In these heterologous combinations, base pairing between Inc RNA and RepZ mRNA at the mutation site was mismatched as shown in column 4, Table II. We found the effect of replacement (or mismatch) differed by the mutation site. Accordingly, each mutation was classified into two types. In the type I mutations such asrep2006, G328A, and C329T, a C:A mismatch at the mutation site resulted in the highest level of repZ expression in the presence of Inc RNA between 55 and 124 units (lines 21, 26,and 29). The fact that the type I mutations were located in three contiguous bases (5′-rGGC-3′/3′-rCCG-5′) at position 327–329 suggest strongly that an initial base pairing interaction between Inc RNA and structure I at these positions is rate-limiting for the intermolecular interaction in vivo. On the other hand, the decreased action of Inc RNA with T325C, T326C, T326G, or G331A mutations on the repZ-lacZ reporter plasmid carrying complementary substitution was partially overcome by replacing either the donor or recipient plasmid with wild-type (lines 5, 9, 14, and 34). We classified these mutations as type II. We reasoned that the decreased action of Inc RNA in the complementary donor-recipient combination of these mutants was due to a requirement for specific Inc RNA or RepZ mRNA sequence (structure) in addition to ability to base pair. The G330A mutation, also known to be as defective in pseudoknot formation as rep2041 (9Asano K. Kato A. Moriwaki H. Hama C. Shiba K. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3774-3781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), did not belong to either of these classes, since any replacement did not affect repZexpression (Table II). The same holds true for the moderate copy-up mutation, C334A. As will be described later, however, these mutations could be classified as type I′ (a subtype of type I) and type II, respectively, by assaying in vitro binding between Inc RNA and RepZ mRNA (see below). To further analyze the intermolecular interaction between Inc RNA and RepZ mRNA, we synthesized in vitro 32P-Inc RNA and RNA293, a part of the RepZ mRNA leader region, from wild-type and mutant derivatives. The mutations used are identical to those employed in Table II (see Fig. 1). To measure the degree of the intermolecular interaction, the wild-type 32P-Inc RNA (2.5 × 10−10m) was incubated with excess amounts (2.5 × 10−9-1 × 10−7m) of unlabeled wild-type RNA293. A portion of the mixture was withdrawn at various times and analyzed electrophoretically on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The pattern of hybridization of 32P-Inc RNA in the presence of 1 × 10−8mRNA293 is shown in Fig.2 A. When the relative amount of unhybridized Inc RNA was plotted as the function of incubation time, the rate of RNA-RNA hybrid formation followed the pseudo first-order kinetics (Fig. 2 B). The apparent binding rate k′, defined as ln 2/t½, where t½ is time in seconds required to bind one-half of the Inc RNA, was proportional to the molar concentration of RNA293 (data not shown). Therefore, we obtained the binding rate constant k, defined as k′/[RNA293], to be 6.8 × 105/m/s. This value was comparable to those obtained for other antisense RNA systems such as ColE1 RNA I, R1 CopA, Tn10 RNA-OUT, ColE2 RNA I, or IncB pMU720 RNA I (1Eguchi Y. Itoh T. Tomizawa J. Annu. Rev.

When the same amount of RNA293 and Inc RNA, each carryingrep2006 and the complementary base change, respectively, were incubated together, the apparent binding rate decreased as shown in Fig. 2 B, confirm"

Although HRG can bind to ErbB3 and ErbB4 homodimers, the highest affinity and most intracellularly active receptor complexes are hetero-oligomers containing ErbB2. The HRGβ egf domain was displayed on the surface of M13 phage to facilitate mutagenic analysis and optimize for binding to a homodimeric ErbB3-immunoglobulin (IgG) fusion. Nine libraries were constructed in which virtually the entire sequence was randomized in stretches of four to six amino acids. These were selected separately for binding to immobilized ErbB3-IgG. Analysis of the resulting sequences revealed some areas that diverged radically from the wild-type, whereas others showed strong conservation. The degree of wild-type conservation correlated strongly with the functional importance of the residues as determined by alanine scanning mutagenesis (Jones, J. T., Ballinger, M. D., Pisacane, P.

Some variants from several libraries showed significant improvements in binding affinity to the ErbB3-IgG. These optimized segments were combined in various ways in the same molecule to generate variants (containing up to 16 mutations) that had >50-fold higher affinity than wild-type HRGβ. The optimized variants stimulated ErbB2 phophorylation on MCF7 cells at levels similar to wild-type. This indicates wild-type affinity is optimized for potency and that factors other than affinity for ErbB3 are limiting. These variants showed enhanced affinity toward the ErbB4 homodimer, suggesting these receptors use very similar binding determinants despite them having 65% sequence identity.

The solution structure of the egf domain of HRGα has recently been determined to high resolution by NMR (19Nagata K. Kohda D. Hatanaka H. Ichikawa S. Matsuda S. Yamamoto T. Suzuki A. Inagaki F.

The salient features of the molecule include an N-terminal subdomain containing a central three-stranded β-sheet, a helical region, and a smaller C-terminal subdomain that contains a short β-sheet. The domain is stabilized by three disulfide bonds, two in the N-terminal subdomain and one in the C-terminal subdomain (Fig. 1). Despite strong structural similarities (20Jacobsen N.E. Abadi N. Sliwkowski M.X. Reilly D. Skelton N.J. Fairbrother W.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3402-3417Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the HRGs share limited sequence homology with EGF (6Holmes W.E.

However, substitution of blocks of EGF sequence into HRG did not impair binding to cells expressing ErbB3 and ErbB2 (21Barbacci E.G. Guarino B.C. Stroh J.G. Singleton D.H. Rosnack K.J. Moyer J.D.

As detailed in the preceding paper (41Jones J.T. Ballinger M.D. Pisacane P.I. Lofgren J.A. Fitzpatrick V.D. Fairbrother W.J. Wells J.A. Sliwkowski M.X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11667-11674Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), the minimal HRGβ egf domain (which differs from the α-isoform by nine substitutions near the C terminus) has now been analyzed for ErbB3-IgG and ErbB4-IgG binding determinants by alanine-scanning mutagenesis. Phage display has been successfully applied to the affinity optimization of several ligands toward a desired receptor (for review, see Ref. 22Clackson T. Wells J.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 12: 173-184Scopus (229) Google Scholar). These include a recent report of phage display of EGF (23Souriau C. Fort P. Roux P. Hartley O. Lefranc M.-P. Weill M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We report here the monovalent phagemid display of theegf domain of HRGβ for the purpose of selecting variants having higher affinity to the homodimeric ErbB3 receptor-IgG fusion. The purpose was 2-fold. First, we wished to complement the loss-of-function information of the alanine scan with a methodical optimization of stretches of sequence toward receptor binding. Given the manageable size of the domain, this could be done comprehensively and thus reveal areas that could be functionally improved. Second, we wanted to determine how affinity improvements for the ErbB3 receptor would influence potency in cell-based assays and selectivity for ErbB3versus ErbB4. In this work, we have generated HRG variants that have dramatically increased affinity to ErbB3-IgG; the recruited mutations also yield ErbB4 binding enhancements and retain wild-type like affinities to ErbB2/3 heterodimers. Our studies suggest that binding determinants on the ErbB3 and ErbB4 receptors are very similar despite them having substantial overall sequence diversity. Various lengths of the HRGβ egf domain gene (residues 177–227, 177–244, 147–227, and 147–244) were amplified from the vector pHL89 (from Dan Yansura, Genentech, Inc. (6Holmes W.E. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Henzel W.J. Lee J. Park J.W. Yansura D. Abadi N. Raab H. Lewis G.D. Shepard H.M. Kuang W.-J. Wood W.I. Goeddel D.V. Vandlen R.L. Science. 1992; 256: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar)) by polymerase chain reaction with primers havingNsiI/XbaI-containing overhangs. These fragments were installed into the phagemid display vector pam-g3 (a derivative of phGHam-g3 containing a stuffer fragment rather than the human growth hormone gene), in which the HRG egf domain was attached to the C terminus of pIII at residue 247, by restriction digestion and ligation at the same sites. These generated vectors pHRG1-g3, pHRG2-g3, pHRG4-g3, and pHRG5-g3. pHRG1-g3 was used as a template for Kunkel mutagenesis (24Kunkel T.A. Bebenek K. McClary J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 204: 125-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar) to change the A227V mutation (required byXbaI site installation) back to wild-type to generate pHRG6-g3. pHRG1-g3 template was also used to generate pHRG8-g3, in which HRG177–228 (hereafter referred to as 1–52) was attached to pIII 323 through a linker containing 3 consecutive GGGS repeats, and pHRG11-g3, in which HRG residues 1–54 were attached to pIII residue 248 through a GGGSGGG linkage. Combination mutants were constructed by Kunkel mutagenesis, using one of the parent selectants as template. pHRG8-g3 was used as a template for constructing mutant libraries by Kunkel mutagenesis. For each library, TAA and TGA stop codons were installed at positions destined for randomization to generate custom templates that eliminated wild-type background from the pools. Positions were fully randomized by mutation to NNS codons (where N represents a mixture of all four bases and S is a mixture of G and C). One oligonucleotide was used for each library mutagenesis reaction except for library F, for which two (one randomizing positions 2 and 4, the the other 22 and 24) were used simultaneously. Mutagenesis oligonucleotides contained 18 base overhangs on either side of randomized residues. Mutagenesis reaction mixtures were electrotransformed into XL-1 blue cells (Stratagene, Inc.) and the cells were infected with 1011 plaque-forming units of KO7 helper phage. Phage stocks (∼1014 phagemid/ml) were made by resuspending polyethylene glycol 8000 precipitates of culture broths from the cells after 18–24 h of growth. Wells of Nunc immunosorp 96-well plates were coated overnight with 0.5 μg of rabbit anti-human IgG (Fc-specific) antibodies (Jackson Immunoresearch) in 100 μl of 50 mm NaCO3, pH 9.6. Wells were blocked for 30 min with 200 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (0.01m sodium phosphate, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 7.5), and 0.1% bovine serum albumin, rinsed with wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline + 0.05% Tween 20), coated with 0.1 μg of ErbB3-IgG in binding buffer (phosphate-buffered saline + 0.1% bovine serum albumin + 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h, and washed again. Approximately 1012 phage in 100 μl of binding buffer were applied to both the ErbB3-Ig-coated well and a control well in which no ErbB3 had been added. Following a 2-h incubation at room temperature, plates were washed extensively (12 ×) and phage eluted by treatment with 100 μl of 50 mm HCl + 0.05% Tween 20 and shaking for 10 min. Eluates were neutralized with 10 μl of 1 m Tris-Cl, pH 8.0, and 20 μl used for titration on log-phase XL-1 blue cells. The remainder was used to infect 1 ml of log-phase XL-1 blue cells (30 min at 37 °C), which were then superinfected with 2 × 1010 plaque-forming units KO7 phage and grown in 25 ml of 2YT broth containing 50 μg/ml carbenicillin for 18–24 h. Phage were harvested as described above and the cycle repeated. Following 6 rounds (libraries A, B, or D–F) or 7 rounds (libraries C or G–I) of selection, 12 clones from each were randomly sequenced by the dideoxy method (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52649) Google Scholar). Phagemid stocks prepared from selected clones were analyzed by phage ELISA as described previously (26Cunningham B.C. Lowe D.G. Li B. Bennett B.D. Wells J.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2508-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 27Pearce K.H. Potts B. Presta L. Bald L. Fendly B. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20595-20602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), with slight modifications. Microtiter plates (Nunc, Maxisorp, 96 wells) were precoated with anti-IgG and coated with receptor as described for the selection procedure. For ErbB3 displacements, some assays were carried out using ErbB4-coated plates to capture uncompeted phagemids due to increased signal versus ErbB3 coat. This should not affect the measured affinities of the phagemid for soluble ErbB3 competitor so long as the receptors compete with one another for HRG-phage binding. Serial dilutions of receptor-IgG fusion and a concentration of phage predetermined to give 60% saturation (without competitor) were added to the wells in 100 μl of binding buffer. Following incubation for 2 h at room temperature, plates were washed extensively, treated with anti-M13 horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and assayed for bound phagemid. EC50 values were calculated as the concentration of soluble receptor required to compete half of the phage off the plate. To facilitate expression of soluble egfdomains, TAG codons were installed following residue 52 in the phagemids by Kunkel mutagenesis and the resulting constructs transformed into 34B8 cells. Cell cultures were grown to a density of OD550 = 1.0 in LB broth plus 50 μg/ml carbenicillin and used to inoculate modified AP5 medium (1.5 g of glucose, 11 g of Hycase SF, 0.6 g of yeast extract, 0.19 g of MgSO4, 1.07 g of NH4Cl, 3.73 g of KCl, 1.2 g of NaCl, and 0.12 mol of triethanolamine, pH 7.4, per liter), at 1/100 dilution. Cells were harvested after 24 h of growth at 30 °C (OD550 = 1.2) by centrifugation at 4500 rpm, and the pellets frozen in ethanol/dry ice for 2 h. Following resuspension and thawing in 5 mm MgCl2, 75 mm CaCl2, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6, the shocked cells were removed by centrifugation. Shockates were filtered and chromatographed by C18 reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a gradient from 0 to 40% acetonitrile, and fractions shown by electrospray mass spectrometry to contain the HRG egf domain were lyophilized and resuspended in 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.6. Proteins were found to be essentially homogeneous as determined by amino acid analysis and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Receptor-IgGs were coated onto Microlite 96-well plates as described for the selection procedure, except 1 ng (ErbB3-IgG and ErbB4-IgG) or 2.5 ng (ErbB2/3-IgG) of receptor was coated per well. A constant and subsaturating concentration of 125I-HRG (1–68) was incubated with varying concentrations of HRG variant in RPMI 1640 cell culture medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) plus 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES buffer, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin, pH 7.2. Following incubation, wells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline plus 0.05% Tween 20, and 100 μl of scintillation fluid added. Plates were counted on a Hewlett-Packard Top-count γ-counter. KIRA-ELISA assays were carried out as described previously (28Sadick M.D. Sliwkowski M.X. Nuijens A. Bald L. Chiang N. Lofgren J.A. Wong W.L.T. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 235: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We first constructed several M13 pIII fusions in a monovalent format (29Bass S. Greene R. Wells J.A. Proteins. 1990; 8: 309-314Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar, 30Lowman H.B. Bass S.H. Simpson N. Wells J.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10832-10838Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) to determine the minimal size of the egfdomain required for high-affinity receptor binding. In the initial discovery of HRG, residues 177–241 (β-form) were found to bind with similar high affinity as the full-length construct (6Holmes W.E. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W. Henzel W.J. Lee J. Park J.W. Yansura D. Abadi N. Raab H. Lewis G.D. Shepard H.M. Kuang W.-J. Wood W.I. Goeddel D.V. Vandlen R.L. Science. 1992; 256: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the data from Barbacci et al. (21Barbacci E.G. Guarino B.C. Stroh J.G. Singleton D.H. Rosnack K.J. Moyer J.D. Andrews G.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270 (5989): 9585Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), indicates that residues 177–226 of HRGβ are sufficient for high-affinity binding and activation of ErbB2/3 receptor-expressing cells. The NMR structure of HRGα 177–239 reveals that residues beyond 226 are unstructured (19Nagata K. Kohda D. Hatanaka H. Ichikawa S. Matsuda S. Yamamoto T. Suzuki A. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3517-3523Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar,20Jacobsen N.E. Abadi N. Sliwkowski M.X. Reilly D. Skelton N.J. Fairbrother W.J.

J., Liu, J., Pisacane, P. I., Sliwkowski, M. X., and Palmer, A. G., III (1998) J. Mol. Biol., in press. To verify that residues immediately upstream or downstream of the minimal egf domain were unimportant in the context of phage display, we generated HRGβ 147–227, 147–244, 177–227, and 177–244 as C-terminal pIII fusions. These constructs were analyzed for their binding to the high-affinity ErbB2/3-IgG fusion by phage ELISA (TableI) (26Cunningham B.C. Lowe D.G. Li B. Bennett B.D. Wells J.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2508-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 31Li B. Tom J.Y. Oare D. Yen R. Fairbrother W.J. Wells J.A. Cunningham B.C. Science. 1995; 270: 1657-1660Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). All bound specifically to immobilized receptor and could be competed off with soluble receptor with similar EC50 values (5–42 nm). The affinities measured were ∼100-fold weaker than theK d previously measured on cells, or the IC50 measured for radiolabeled HRG binding to ErbB 2/3-IgG (6Holmes W.E. Sliwkowski M.X. Akita R.W.

Science. 1992; 256: 1205-1210Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar).2 The EC50 values obtained from phage ELISA are sometimes higher than the true K d , particularly for high-affinity interactions. This may be due to the high receptor coat concentration required to give a reasonable signal for the bound phage, a low percentage of active receptor in competitor solutions, or interference from the linkage of the protein to pIII (27Pearce K.H. Potts B. Presta L. Bald L. Fendly B. Wells J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20595-20602Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Clearly the 147–177 sequence bore no benefit to the HRG-phage binding, although the constructs that extended out to 244 yielded slightly higher affinity. To alleviate any potential steric problems occurring near the C terminus, we also tried fusions of the minimal egf domain (177–228, hereafter referred to as 1–52) with extended flexible linkers and fusion to pIII at residue 323 rather than 247. This yielded a mild improvement in affinity and somewhat increased functional expression as determined by titration of the phage stocks (data not shown).Table IInitial HRG-phage constructsConstructHRGβ residuesLinker and pIII fusion pointErbB2/3-IgG EC50nmHRG2177–244pIII 2476.0HRG4147–227pIII 24738HRG5147–244pIII 2474.7HRG6177–227pIII 24740HRG7177–228 (1–52)1-bHeregulin 177–228 are referred to as 1–52 in text.pIII 24742HRG8177–228 (1–52)(GGGS)3-pIII 32311HRG11177–230GGGSGGG-pIII 24719a Average of duplicate experiments.1-b Heregulin 177–228 are referred to as 1–52 in text.

Stretches of four to six residues at a time were randomized in a linear fashion, except for the six cysteines, Phe13 (which is partially buried), and the two most C-terminal residues (Fig. 1). The molecule was thus covered in 8 libraries. Library E, covering residues 26 to 33, contained a three-residue deletion in an effort to reduce the size of the domain. This region corresponds to a poorly structured Ω-loop between the second and third β-strands of the domain, and the equivalent amino acids are absent in EGF and transforming growth factor α. A control construct in which residues 26–28 of HRG8 were deleted (HRG63) showed similar ErbB3 binding as the wild-type (TableII). An additional library (F) was created to explore a surface patch that appeared to be important based on the data of Barbacci et al. (21Barbacci E.G. Guarino B.C. Stroh J.G. Singleton D.H.

Interactions between integral membrane proteins and the underlying spectrin-actin cytoskeleton play important roles in determining cell morphology, motility, activation, proliferation, contact, and even maintenance of specialized membrane domains. Protein 4.1 was initially identified as an 80-kDa multifunctional protein of the membrane-skeleton of human red blood cells. The function of 4.1 in this cell type as an stabilizing protein of the spectrin-actin network anchored to the plasma membrane via interactions with transmembrane proteins has been widely analyzed (for a review, see Ref. 1Conboy J.G.

Hematol. 1995; 19: 79-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). More recent studies have shown that avian erythrocytes and mammalian nonerythroid tissues present a variety of immunoreactive 4.1 polypeptides of M r ranging from 30,000 to 210,000 (7Anderson R.A. Correas I. Mazzucco C. Castle J.D. Marchesi V.T. J. Cell. Biochem. 1988; 37: 269-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 8Granger B.L. Lazarides E. Cell. 1984; 37: 597-607Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Alternative splicing of the 4.1 pre-mRNA, the existence of two possible translation initiation sites, and posttranslational modifications are the causes for the generation of the extensive repertoire of 4.1 isoforms (1Conboy J.G. Semin. Hematol. 1993; 30: 58-73PubMed Google Scholar). Protein 4.1 expression has been most extensively studied in the erythroid system, where alternative splicing events involving exons 2 and 16 result in alterations in the structure of the N-terminal domain and the function of the spectrin-actin binding domain, respectively (9Tang T.K.

In differentiated epithelial cells, an alternative splicing event regulates the expression of exon 17B, whereas exon 17A is specifically expressed in muscle cells (16Schischmanoff P.O. Yaswen P.

All of these experiments show that the inclusion/exclusion of some 4.1 exons appears to be tissue-specific and developmentally regulated. In mature red blood cells, protein 4.1 is localized at the periphery of the cell. In addition to this distribution, 4.1 presents different intracellular localizations in nonerythroid cells. This includes the cytoplasmic compartment (18Cohen C.M. Foley S.F. Korsgren C. Nature. 1982; 299: 648-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 19Leto T.L. Pratt B.M. Marchesi J.A. J. Cell Physiol. 1986; 127: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and the nucleus (20Correas I. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 21De Cárcer G.

In the nucleus, several immunoreactive 4.1 proteins have been identified (20Correas I. Biochem. J. 1991; 279: 581-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 21De Cárcer G. Lallena M.J.

Immunofluorescence microscopy and cell fractionation studies suggest that there are distinct nuclear 4.1 populations, as deduced by their differential responses to extraction with a variety of agents (21De Cárcer G. Lallena M.J. Correas I. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Different isoforms of protein 4.1 are present in nuclear matrix preparations of several mammalian cells, suggesting that they could be structural elements of this network (21De Cárcer G. Lallena M.J. Correas I. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23Krauss S.W. Larabell C.A. Lockett S. Gascard P. Penman S. Mohandas N. Chasis J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 275-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Furthermore, isolated erythroid 4.1 interacts with tubulin (24Correas I. Avila J. Biochem. J. 1988; 255: 217-221PubMed Google Scholar) and myosin (25Pasternack G.R. Racusen R.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9712-9716Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), and a recent study also shows that protein 4.1 rearranges to the mitotic spindle during cell division (23Krauss S.W. Larabell C.A. Lockett S. Gascard P. Penman S. Mohandas N. Chasis J.A. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 275-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). All of these data suggest that protein 4.1 may play additional roles different from the membrane-skeletal linking function assigned to erythroid 4.1. Most of the studies analyzing 4.1 distribution in nonerythroid nucleated cells have been developed using anti-4.1 antibodies as tools. Therefore, it is not yet known whether the immunostaining of different subcellular compartments is due to the existence of different 4.1 isoforms or whether, on the contrary, the same 4.1 protein is targeted to different compartments by regulation through posttranslational modifications. The complexity of alternative splicing events suffered by the 4.1 pre-mRNA makes necessary the cloning of each of the different 4.1 coding sequences in a single piece to ensure that the encoded products correspond to naturally occurring 4.1 isoforms. In this study, we have approached this point by reverse transcription PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; NLS, nuclear localization signal; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid; LMW, low molecular weight. techniques using mRNA from the nucleated human Molt-4 T-cell line. Molecular cloning of 4.1 isoforms has provided us the opportunity to analyze the intracellular localization of two isoforms that differ only in the inclusion or exclusion of exon 16. Here, we report that a 4.1 isoform containing the sequences encoded by exon 16, named 4.1H, is differentially targeted to the nucleus, whereas a 4.1 isoform lacking those sequences, named 4.1I, is localized in the cytoplasm. A cluster of basic amino acids (KKKR) generated by joining exon 13 and 16 sequences was identified as necessary for the nuclear targeting of 4.1H by mutagenesis analysis. This nuclear isoform belongs to the group of 4.1 proteins extractable in Triton X-100 and with a diffuse distribution in the nucleoplasm. This is the first demonstration of differential nuclear targeting by the inclusion of an alternative domain among naturally occurring protein 4.1 isoforms. Human T lymphoid Molt-4 cells were used as RNA source for cDNA cloning, fibroblastic COS-7 cells from monkey kidney and HeLa cells were used for transient expression experiments, and COS-7 and Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells for immunofluorescence and Western blot analysis. Molt-4 cells were grown on tissue culture flasks in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). COS-7, HeLa, and MDCK cells were grown on culture dishes or on glass coverslips in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Both media were supplemented with 1% glutamine, 5% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.), penicillin (50 units/ml), and streptomycin (50 units/ml). Cultures were maintained at 37 °C under a 5% CO2/95% air humidified atmosphere. Transfection experiments were performed by electroporation using the Electro Cell Manipulator 600 (BTX, San Diego, CA), using the following parameters: 200 V, 950 microfarads, and 480 ohms in a 4-mm-gap cuvette. Cells were processed 48 h after transfection. Cytoplasmic RNA was extracted from Molt-4 cells, as described previously (26Favaloro J. Treisman R. Kramen R. Method Enzymol. 1980; 65: 718-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). 4.1 mRNA was specifically reverse-transcribed using AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega) and the specific 4.1 antisense primer cDNA2-E22a (CTGAAGTCTGACTATGGCAGGTTAGC), corresponding to 3′-untranslated sequences contained in exon 22 (Isogen Bioscience BV, Maarsen, The Netherlands). The 4.1 cDNAs were then PCR amplified under the conditions described by Conboy et al. (11Conboy J.G. Chan J.Y. Chasis J.A. Kan Y.W. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8273-8280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) usingTaq polymerase (Promega), sinE2′ sense (CCGCACCCAGCCCAGAGAAGAGTT) (a primer that excludes exon 2′ and matches the joining of exons 1 and 2), and stopE21a (TCACTCATCAGCAATCTCGG) (an antisense primer corresponding to the 3′-end of the 4.1 coding sequence). Reaction products were cloned into the pMosBLUE T-vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For expression experiments, 4.1 cDNAs were tagged at their 3′-termini by PCR. Reactions were carried out using sinE2′ and stop-c-Myc, an antisense primer complementary to the 3′-end of the 4.1 coding sequence and encoding the c-Myc 9E10 epitope (MEQKLISEEDL) (27Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar). The cDNAs encoding epitope-tagged 4.1 proteins were finally cloned into the pSRα mammalian expression vector (28Takebe Y. Seiki M. Fujisawa J.I. Hoy P. Yokota K. Arai K.I. Yoshida M. Arai N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 466-472Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-4.1 antibodies designated 10a and 10b are affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies against synthetic peptides designed according to the sequence of the 8–10-kDa 4.1 domain, involved in the association of 4.1 with spectrin and actin (3Correas I. Speicher D.W. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13362-13366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies 10a and 10b recognize epitopes encoded by the alternative exon 16 and the constitutive exon 17, respectively (3Correas I. Speicher D.W. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13362-13366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-c-Myc monoclonal antibody 9E10 (27Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2166) Google Scholar) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. Goat anti-rabbit IgG and anti-mouse Ig secondary antibodies, conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, fluorescein isothiocyanate, or Texas Red isothiocyanate were obtained from Southern Biotechnology Associates, Inc. (Birmingham, AL). Cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 10% formalin (37% formaldehyde solution, Sigma) for 20 min at room temperature, and the unreacted formaldehyde was quenched by incubation with 10 mm glycine for 10 min. Cells were then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min at room temperature and blocked by incubation with 3% bovine serum albumin. Cells were incubated with the appropriate antibodies and processed as described by De Cárcer et al. (21De Cárcer G. Lallena M.J. Correas I. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). DNA was stained with 1 mg/ml 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma) for 5 min at room temperature. After incubation, preparations were washed, mounted on microscope slides, and examined with a Zeiss epifluorescence microscope. Controls to assess the specificity and the lack of cross-labeling included incubations with nonimmune rabbit serum and irrelevant monoclonal antibodies or omission of either of the primary antibodies. In transfection experiments, anti-4.1 antibodies were used 25-fold diluted, relative to concentrations used for detection of endogenous protein, in order to detect only exogenous epitope-tagged 4.1 proteins. Mock-transfected cell controls were analyzed with anti-c-Myc or anti-4.1 antibodies. Sequencing of 4.1 cDNAs was done using the ABI PRISM dye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit with AmpliTaq DNA polymerase, FS (Perkin-Elmer). Sequencing PCRs were carried out in a GeneAmp PCR System 9600 (Perkin-Elmer) and examined in an ABI 373A automatic sequencer. In order to cover the entire cloned sequences, reactions were carried out from different exons, using 4.1-specific primers designed according to the composite 4.1 cDNA sequence deposited in GenBankTM under accession numberM61733 (11Conboy J.G. Chan J.Y. Chasis J.A. Kan Y.W. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8273-8280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Coupled in vitro transcription and translation reactions were done using the TNT T7 reticulocyte lysate system (Promega), and pMos-BLUE cloned 4.1 cDNAs as templates. Synthesized proteins were radiolabeled by including [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the reaction. After fractionation by SDS-PAGE in 8% acrylamide minigels, proteins were stained with Coomasie Blue, and the gels were dried and exposed on Kodak autoradiographic films. Mutagenesis of the cluster of basic amino acids present in 4.1H was made by the overlap extension technique (29Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.H. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). To obtain full-length 4.1H mutated in the basic tetrapeptide (4.1Hmut), PCRs were performed using 4.1H cDNA, sinE2′ sense, and stop-c-Myc antisense primers, and two complementary oligonucleotides covering both strands of 4.1 exon 13/16 junction. These primers encode a mutation that changed the basic cluster (KKKR) into uncharged amino acids (TNSG). The PCR product was cloned into the pCR3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen BV, Leek, The Netherlands). Additionally, a 4.1/β-galactosidase chimeric cDNA was constructed using two complementary oligonucleotides that were annealed and cloned into the KpnI site of pCH110 plasmid (30Hall C.V. Jacob P.E. Ringold G.M. Lee F. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1983; 2: 101-109PubMed Google Scholar) (GenBankTM accession number U13845). The construct encodes a fusion protein that contains 20 residues from 4.1H, including the cluster of basic amino acids, at the N-terminal region of β-galactosidase. Cells grown on Petri dishes were rinsed twice in PBS and then either lysed in 100 μl of solubilizing Laemmli buffer (31Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar) or subjected to extraction with 0.5% Triton X-100, as described previously (21De Cárcer G. Lallena M.J. Correas I. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Protein fractions were processed, separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon-polyvinylidene difluoride (Millipore, Bedford, MA) in CAPS buffer, pH 11. Membranes were processed and developed as described previously (21De Cárcer G. Lallena M.J. Correas I. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 871-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Previous studies have shown a great diversity of 4.1 isoforms that are partly generated by alternative splicing of 4.1 pre-mRNA. A summary of alternative and constitutive exons is shown in Fig.1 A. The prototypical erythroid protein 4.1 is translated from a translation initiation site present in exon 4 (ATG-2). Higher molecular weight 4.1 isoforms can be generated when a complex alternative splicing event takes place that consists of the inclusion of exon 2′ concomitantly with the exclusion of exon 3. This event introduces an in-frame translation initiation site (ATG-1) present in exon 2′, which adds 209 amino acids N-terminal to the prototypical erythroid 4.1 protein. Thus, two different 4.1 isoform groups can be generated attending to whether ATG-2 or ATG-1 is used as the translation initiation site. These two groups are denominated low molecular weight (LMW) and high molecular weight 4.1 isoforms, respectively (Fig. 1 B). To clone directly in a single DNA fragment the coding sequences corresponding to the subset of low molecular weight 4.1 isoforms, we adopted a reverse transcription PCR approach, using RNA from the Molt-4 T-cell line as the starting template and 4.1 oligonucleotide primers specific for this subset of cDNAs. 4.1 cDNA was synthesized using the oligonucleotide primer cDNA2-E22a corresponding to 3′-untranslated sequences contained in exon 22. The cDNA was then amplified by PCR using the oligonucleotides sinE2′ (a 5′ sense amplification primer that excludes exon 2′ and matches the joining of exons 1 and 2) and stopE21a (an antisense primer corresponding to the 3′-end of the 4.1 coding sequence) (Fig. 1 C). Thus, the resulting cDNAs encode proteins belonging to the group of LMW 4.1 isoforms. The 4.1 PCR products were cloned into the plasmid pMOS-BLUE and sequenced. Seven different low molecular weight 4.1 cDNAs were identified on the basis of the presence or absence of specific exons. In this study, we focused on the analysis of two of them, designated 4.1H and 4.1I, differing only in the presence (4.1H) or absence (4.1I) of exon 16 sequences. A diagram showing the exon composition of 4.1H and 4.1I cDNAs is presented in Fig.1 D. The 4.1H and 4.1I cDNAs were tagged with sequences encoding the c-Myc 9E10 epitope to distinguish their protein products from endogenous 4.1 proteins and cloned into a mammalian expression vector to analyze their intracellular distribution in transfected cells. COS-7 cells transiently expressing epitope-tagged 4.1H or 4.1I were analyzed 48 h after transfection by double-labeling immunofluorescence microscopy using anti-c-Myc (9E10) and anti-4.1 (either 10a or 10b) antibodies. As detected by anti-c-Myc antibody, the distribution of the 4.1H isoform was mainly diffuse in the nucleoplasm, avoiding nucleoli (Fig.2 A), whereas the 4.1I isoform was localized in the cytoplasm, drawing bright fibers along cellular prolongations (Fig. 2 D). Over 20 transfection experiments were performed and analyzed. As for 4.1H, ∼72% out of more than 400 analyzed transfected cells had the staining pattern shown in Fig.2 A, whereas the remaining 28% displayed intense cytoplasmic and nuclear staining. In case of 4.1I expression, the pattern shown in Fig. 2 D is representative of ∼71% out of more than 400 transfected cells analyzed. The remaining 29% of the cells displayed cytoplasmic and nuclear staining. Similar distribution patterns were observed for 4.1H and 4.1I using the anti-10b antibody (data not shown). Cells transfected with vector lacking 4.1cDNA insert showed no staining with either anti-c-Myc or anti-4.1 antibodies (not shown). Exon 16 is an alternative exon (9Tang T.K. Leto T.L. Correas I. Alonso M.A. Marchesi V.T. Benz Jr., E.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3713-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); its inclusion in mature mRNA has been evolutionarily conserved (15Winardi R. Discher D. Kelley C. Zon L. Mays K. Mohandas N. Conboy J.G. Blood. 1995; 86: 4315-4322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is developmentally regulated in erythroid cells (9Tang T.K. Leto T.L. Correas I. Alonso M.A. Marchesi V.T. Benz Jr., E.J.

Blood. 1995; 86: 4315-4322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), helping to provide mechanical stability to red blood cells (13Discher D. Parra M. Conboy J.G. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 7186-7195Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The selective presence of exon 16 sequences in the 4.1H cDNA led us to use the anti-4.1 antibody (10a), raised against a synthetic peptide included in the sequence encoded by exon 16 (3Correas I. Speicher D.W. Marchesi V.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 13362-13366Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), to demonstrate the expression of exon 16 in the 4.1H isoform. Thus, cells transfected with 4.1I showed the characteristic cytoplasmic staining pattern with the anti-c-Myc antibody (Fig. 2 D) but were not immunostained with the anti-10a antibody (Fig. 2 F). By contrast, cells transfected with 4.1H cDNA were immunostained with both anti-c-Myc (Fig. 2 A) and anti-10a (Fig.2 C) antibodies. Similar results were obtained in transiently transfected HeLa cells (not shown). These experiments demonstrate expression of exon 16 in 4.1H and not in 4.1I. The apparent molecular mass of the in vitro(Fig. 3 A) or in vivo (Fig. 3 B) synthesized 4.1H and 4.1I proteins were determined by SDS-PAGE. 4.1H and 4.1I cDNAs were transcribedin vitro with T7 RNA polymerase and translated in vitro using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. This yielded products of apparent molecular mass of ∼82 kDa for 4.1H (Fig. 3 A, lane 1) and of ∼80 kDa for 4.1I (Fig. 3 A, lane 2). Similar sizes were observed for both isofoms in extracts prepared from transiently transfected COS cells (Fig. 3 B). Antibodies to the c-Myc tag or to 4.1 (anti-10b) recognized both 4.1H and 4.1I isoforms (Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–6), whereas antibody 10a recognized only the 4.1H isoform (Fig. 3 B, lanes 7–9). Inclusion of exon 16 sequences in 4.1 mRNA is a late event in erythropoiesis (11Conboy J.G. Chan J.Y. Chasis J.A. Kan Y.W. Mohandas N. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8273-8280Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Baklouti F. Huang S.C. Tang T.K. Delaunay J. Marchesi V.T. Benz Jr., E.J. Blood. 1996; 87: 3934-3941Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and its presence has been reported in many nonerythroid cell lines and tissues. Hence, mRNAs and partial cDNA clones containing exon 16 have been obtained from mouse brain, embryos, endothelial cells, spleen, skeletal muscle, and testis and from human endothelial cells, fetal liver, bone marrow, brain, liver, and intestine (10Tang T.K. Leto T. Marchesi V.T. Benz E.J. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 617-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 11Conboy J.G. Chan J.Y. Chasis J.A. Kan Y.W. Mohandas N. J. Biol.

Chem. 1993; 268: 3758-3766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To further investigate the expression of exon 16-encoded sequences in endogenous 4.1, we carried out both immunoblot and immunofluorescence analysis with anti-10a antibody in nucleated COS-7 (Fig.4 A) and MDCK (Fig.4 B) cells. In interphase cells, anti-10a antibody gave a diffuse, mainly nuclear staining. In metaphase cells, the staining became cytoplasmic, excluding the chromosomic plate (Fig.4 B). Total cell extracts, analyzed by Western blotting with anti-10a, presented several immunoreactive bands in the range of ∼40–170 kDa (Fig. 4 C). Some of them are shared by COS and MDCK cells, whereas others seemed to be expressed by only one of the cell lines. Polypeptides with apparent molecular masses of ∼80–85 kDa were detected in both samples, coinciding with the range in which 4.1H isoform runs. Whereas small molecules, ions, and metabolites freely diffuse through the nuclear pore, import of molecules larger than 40 kDa requires energy and is mediated by signals on the import substrates (reviewed in Ref. 33Görlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). “Classical” nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) are generally characterized by one or more clusters of basic amino acids (33Görlich D. Mattaj I.W. Science. 1996; 271: 1513-1518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar). Inspection of the 4.1H sequence revealed that a cluster of basic amino acids (KKKR) generated by the joining of exon 13 and 16 sequences is present in this isoform but not in 4.1I. The first lysine within the cluster corresponds to the last amino acid encoded by the constitutive exon 13, whereas the other basic residues are the first three amino acids encoded by the alternative exon 16. This cluster closely resembles the prototypical NLS of the SV40 large T-antigen. To determine whether this basic region is necessary for targeting 4.1H to the nucleus, a construct (4.1Hmut) was generated in which the basic amino acid cluster (KKKR) was substituted with uncharged amino acids (TNSG). 4.1Hmut was transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, and its localization was compared with that of the wild type 4.1H protein by immunofluorescence microscopy. The substitution of the basic amino acids (KKKR) in 4.1H drastically affected its distribution. Thus, whereas 4.1H is targeted to the nucleus (Fig.5 A), the mutant was excluded from this compartment and remained in the cytoplasm (Fig.5 B). This indicates that the basic tetrapeptide (KKKR) encoded by the exon 13/16 junction in the isoform 4.1H is necessa"

Variant and wild type cystatin C production, processing, secretion, and clearance were studied in human cell lines stably overexpressing the cystatin C genes. Immunoblot and mass spectrometry analyses demonstrated monomeric cystatin C in cell homogenates and culture media. While cystatin C formed concentration-dependent dimers, the HCHWA-I variant dimerized at lower concentrations than the wild type protein. Amino-terminal sequence analysis revealed that the variant and normal proteins produced and secreted are the full-length cystatin C.Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated similar levels of normal and variant cystatin C production and secretion. However, the secreted variant cystatin C exhibited an increased susceptibility to a serine protease in conditioned media and in human cerebrospinal fluid, explaining its depletion from the cerebrospinal fluid of HCHWA-I patients. Thus, the amino acid substitution may induce unstable cystatin C with intact inhibitory activity and predisposition to self-aggregation and amyloid fibril formation.

Brain Pathol. 1996; 6: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), is an autosomal dominant form of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). The amyloid deposits mainly in the cerebral and spinal arteries and arterioles and leads to recurrent hemorrhagic strokes causing serious brain damage and eventually death before the age of 40 years (1Arnason A.

Some amyloid deposition is also present in other tissues, such as skin and lymph nodes (4Benedikz E. Blondal H. Gudmundsson G. Virchows Arch. A Pathol. Anat. Histopathol. 1990; 417: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical studies and sequence analysis of amyloid extracted from brain vessels of affected patients have revealed it is a variant of cystatin C (5Ghiso J. Jensson O. Frangione B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2974-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 6Cohen D.H. Feiner H. Jensson O. Frangione B. J. Exp.

S. A. 1982; 79: 3024-3027Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar). It is a cysteine proteinase inhibitor, which inhibits the activities of papain, ficin, and the human cathepsins B, H, and Lin vitro (8Barrett A.J. Davies M.E. Grubb A.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Cystatin C is found in all body fluids and tissues examined and is 5.5 times more concentrated in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) than in plasma (10Hochwald G.M. Pepe A.J. Thorbecke G.J. Proc. Soc. Exp.

The amyloid protein isolated from leptomeninges of HCHWA-I patients is truncated cystatin C, which starts at Gly11 of the normal protein (5Ghiso J. Jensson O. Frangione B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2974-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 6Cohen D.H. Feiner H. Jensson O. Frangione B. J. Exp.

Commun. 1986; 136: 548-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1 for the sequence of normal and variant cystatin C). Truncated forms of cystatin C starting at Leu9 and Val10 are present in normal human urine in addition to the full-length protein (15Popovic T. Brzin J. Ritonja A. Turk V. Biol. Chem. Hoppe-Seyler. 1990; 371: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Removal of the NH2-terminal decapeptide of human cystatin C decreases inhibition of papain and human cathepsins B, L, and H (16Abrahamson M. Mason R.W. Hansson H. Buttle D.J. Grubb A. Ohlsson K. Biochem. J. 1991; 273: 621-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The variant cystatin C has an amino acid substitution (5Ghiso J. Jensson O. Frangione B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 2974-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 6Cohen D.H. Feiner H. Jensson O. Frangione B. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 158: 623-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 14Ghiso J. Pons-Estel B. Frangione B. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 631-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Comparison of the genes encoding cystatin C, isolated from normal tissue and from the brain of an HCHWA-I patient, revealed a mutation in the Icelandic gene resulting in the L68Q substitution (17Levy E. Lopez-Otin C. Ghiso J. Geltner D. Frangione B. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1771-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). This mutation abolishes an AluI restriction site in the cystatin C gene of HCHWA-I patients. Loss of this site was detected by restriction fragment length polymorphism only in HCHWA-I patients and cosegregated with the disease in every case (18Palsdottir A. Abrahamson M. Thorsteinsson L. Arnason A. Olafsson I. Grubb A.O. Jensson O. Lancet. 1988; 2: 603-604Abstract PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The same mutation was identified in the cystatin C gene of a patient with sporadic CAA (19Graffagnino C. Herbstreith M.H. Schmechel D.E. Levy E. Roses A.D. Alberts M.J. Stroke. 1995; 26: 2190-2193Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The concentration of cystatin C in the CSF of HCHWA-I patients is lower compared with normal controls (20Grubb A.O. Jensson O. Gudmundsson G. Arnason A. Lofberg H. Malm J. N. Engl. J. Med. 1984; 311: 1547-1549Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). There are several reports of patients with cerebral hemorrhage related to CAA with low concentration of cystatin C in the CSF (21Nakayama S. Naito Y. Hamaguchi Y. Kuzuhara S. Shimode K. Clin. Neurol. (Tokyo). 1991; 31: 454-457PubMed Google Scholar, 22Nakamura K. Saku Y. Ibayashi S. Fujishima M. Angiology. 1997; 48: 551-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 23Shimode K. Fujihara S. Nakamura M. Kobayashi S. Tsunematsu T. Stroke. 1991; 22: 860-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Immunohistochemical examination of brain tissue obtained from two of these patients confirmed the diagnosis of CAA and identified co-deposition of cystatin C and amyloid β-protein. Since the cystatin C sequence was not determined, it cannot be ruled out that these patients had a mutation in this gene. Thus, sporadic CAA in some patients may be associated with mutations in the cystatin C gene. The frequency of these mutations is yet to be determined. The mechanisms by which soluble precursor proteins are processed to result in the deposition of insoluble amyloid fibrils are unknown. Several observations indicate that aberrant expression or processing of the human β-amyloid precursor protein may lead to the development of Alzheimer's disease (for a review, see Ref. 24Maury C.P.J. Lab. Invest. 1995; 72: 4-16PubMed Google Scholar). Patients with trisomy 21 (Down's syndrome patients) overexpress the protein and tend to develop Alzheimer's disease-like pathology early in life. β-Amyloid precursor protein missense mutations within or flanking the amyloid β-protein region were identified in families with early onset familial Alzheimer's disease. While one mutation causes an increase in the amount of secreted amyloid β-protein, three other substitutions seem to lead to an increased proportion of secreted amyloid β-protein ending at residue Ile42 rather than Val40. This finding may be pathologically relevant, since there is evidence that the longer peptide is more fibrillogenic and enhances the aggregation of shorter peptides in vitro. Data suggest that two other substitutions, which segregate with CAA, enhance the peptide's fibrillogenicity. Although extensive research has been conducted on the amyloidogenicity of the amyloid β-protein, relatively little is known about the processes that lead to cystatin C amyloid formation. The precise nature of the changes due to the amino acid substitution in cystatin C is unknown, although it is clear that it modifies certain physical properties of the protein, resulting in accelerated cerebrovascular amyloid deposition. Recombinant HCHWA-I cystatin C variant was shown to aggregate spontaneously to a significant extent (25Abrahamson M. Grubb A.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1416-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). We studied the possibility that the amino acid substitution found in HCHWA-I patients may affect the production and/or secretion of cystatin C or alternatively result in abnormally processed or incorrectly folded protein. The comparison of expression, secretion, and stability of the variant cystatin C with the wild type protein showed that both are processed and secreted to a similar extent in heterologous cells. However, the secreted wild type protein is resistant to extracellular proteolysis, whereas the secreted variant cystatin C is quickly degraded both in conditioned media and CSF. The full-length normal or HCHWA-I variant cystatin C genes (17Levy E. Lopez-Otin C. Ghiso J. Geltner D. Frangione B. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 169: 1771-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) contained within HindIII sites were subcloned into pRK5 vector and cotransfected with pSV40neo into human culture cell lines using Lipofectamine transfection reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.). Stably transfected cells were selected with Geneticin (G418; Life Technologies, Inc.). Overexpression and secretion of cystatin C were confirmed by Western blot analysis of cell lysates and cell culture media with anti-cystatin C polyclonal antibody (Axell). Minimally, two distinct clones of each stably transfected cell line were used for each type of experiment. All the studies described were carried out with both human astrocytic glioma U251 and human kidney 293 transfected cell lines. Cells stably transfected with the normal or HCHWA-I variant cystatin C genes were grown to near confluency by 24 h. The conditioned medium was collected and spun at 4,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris. The cells were harvested in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3, homogenized with a Polytron homogenizer, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants of spun media and cell homogenates were aliquoted and stored at −70 °C until further use. Equal amounts of total proteins from cell homogenates or equal volumes of media based upon the relative concentration of total proteins in cell homogenates were applied to each lane to enable controlled comparison of cystatin C levels. The samples were boiled in sample buffer (1% SDS, 3% glycerol, 1.5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) and separated by 10% Tricine-Tris-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). For immunoblot analysis of nonreduced proteins, the samples were mixed with sample buffer without β-mercaptoethanol and were not subjected to boiling prior to separation on gels. The proteins were electrophoretically transferred (2 h at 200 mA at 4 °C) to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) using 10 mm CAPS buffer, pH 11.0 containing 10% methanol. The membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk and 3% bovine serum albumin in 10 mm Tris, 150 mmsodium chloride, pH 7.5 (TBS) with 0.1% Tween 20 overnight at room temperature and then incubated with rabbit anti-cystatin C antibodies (1:300) (Axell) for 2 h at room temperature. Horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used as secondary antibody (1:10,000). Membranes were washed with TBS with 0.1% Tween 20 after incubation with primary and secondary antibodies. Immunoblots were visualized on DuPont Reflection Autoradiography film by enhanced chemiluminescence as specified by the manufacturer (Pierce). Cells stably transfected with the normal or HCHWA-I variant cystatin C genes or vector alone were incubated in medium without serum to near confluency by 24 h. The conditioned media and cell homogenates were harvested as described above. The supernatants of spun media and cell homogenates were dialyzed against distilled H2O in Spectra/Por membrane (molecular weight cut-off of 3,500) (Spectrum Medical Industries), concentrated with Centricon 10 (Amicon), and subjected to matrix-assisted laser desorption mass spectrometry using the dried droplet method (26Hillenkamp F. Karas M. Beavis R.C. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 1991; 63: 1193-1203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The matrix used was α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Sigma). The linear, time-of-flight mass spectrometer used was custom built at the Skirball Institute at the New York University Medical Center (27Beavis R.C. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1996; 7: 107-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Cells stably transfected with the normal or HCHWA-I variant cystatin C genes were grown to near confluency by 24 h. The conditioned media were collected, cleared by spinning at 4,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and incubated at room temperature or 37 °C for 0 or 4 days. The cells were lysed with lysis buffer (150 mm sodium chloride, 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% cholic acid, 5 mm EDTA, 52 μm leupeptin, 0.1 μm pepstatin A, and 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cellular and secreted proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-cystatin C antibody and Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 4 h at 4 °C. Cystatin C was also immunoprecipitated from CSF obtained from normal individuals. The pellet was washed twice with lysis buffer and once with TBS, boiled in sample buffer, separated on 10% Tricine-Tris-PAGE, and transferred to Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp.) in CAPS buffer. Membranes were stained with 0.1% Coomassie Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad) in 40% methanol, 1% acetic acid. The bands were excised and sequenced on a Procise-basic 492 microsequencer, and the resulting phenylthiohydantin amino acid derivatives were identified using on-line model 140C Microgradient Delivery System analyzer and the standard program (Applied Biosystems). Stably transfected cells were grown to near confluency and incubated in medium without serum for 24 h. The conditioned media were harvested as described above and dialyzed against distilled H2O in Spectra/Por membrane (molecular weight cut-off of 3,500) (Spectrum Medical Industries). Following lyophilization, the media were suspended in 25 mm ethanolamine buffer, pH 9.4, and applied to a DEAE-Sephadex A-50 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column equilibrated in the same buffer at 4 °C. Under these conditions, cystatin C did not bind to the column and eluted with the flow-through, while most of the other proteins present in the medium absorbed onto the column. Fast and mild purification conditions are essential for isolation of full-length cystatin C. Fractions were monitored by UV spectrometry at 280 nm and immunoblot analysis. Microsequence analysis was performed to confirm the isolation of full-length cystatin C. The purity of cystatin C in the samples was determined by mass spectrometry and by staining the Tricine-Tris gels with 0.05% Coomassie Blue R-250 (Bio-Rad) in 49% methanol, 5% acetic acid. Stably transfected cells were grown on coverslips for up to 8 days in culture. The cells were fixed in ethanol and stained for 1 h with 0.2% Congo Red dissolved in 80% ethanol saturated with sodium chloride, pH 11.0, and 2.5 mm sodium hydroxide. After being washed with 80% ethanol, slides were visualized under polarized light. Stably transfected tissue culture cells were grown to near confluency by 72 h. Nontransfected cells were used under the same conditions as negative controls. Conditioned media were collected and centrifuged at 4,500 × g for 10 min and concentrated on Centricon 3 (Amicon). Cathepsin activity was tested by a fluorometric assay on a Fluoroskan II plate reader (excitation wavelength, 383 nm; emission wavelength, 460 nm) using the synthetic methyl coumaryl substrate Z-Phe-Arg-AMC · HCl. Activity was assayed in concentrated media corresponding to 1 and 4 μg of total protein in cell lysates. The media were incubated in 200 μl of 100 mm sodium phosphate-buffered saline, pH 6.0, containing 2 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithioerythritol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μmpepstatin A, and 20 μm Z-PheArg-AMC · HCl. All samples were analyzed with or without 5 μml-trans-epoxysuccinyl-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butane at 37 °C for 1–24 h.l-trans-Epoxysuccinyl-leucylamido(4-guanidino)butane is an inhibitor of cysteine proteinases including cathepsins B, H, and L (28Barrett A.J. Kembhavi A.A. Brown M.A. Kirschke H. Knight C.G. Tamai M. Hanada K. Biochem. J. 1982; 201: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (920) Google Scholar). All treatments were carried out in duplicate. Stably transfected tissue culture cells were incubated with 300 μCi/ml [35S]methionine/cysteine EXPRE35S35S (DuPont) in methionine/cysteine-free medium with 5% dialyzed serum for a pulse of 20 min at 37 °C. Following two washes with phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3, the cells were chased in complete medium with 150 μg/ml methionine at 37 °C for different periods. The media were collected and spun at 4,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3, and lysed in lysis buffer. 100 μg of total protein of cell lysates and about 200 μl of media (volume in each sample relative to amounts of protein in lysates) were immunoprecipitated with anti-cystatin C antibody and Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 4 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitated proteins were washed with lysis buffer and TBS and separated on 10% Tricine-Tris-PAGE. The gels were enhanced with Amplify (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and exposed to x-ray films. The protein bands were scanned using Adobe Photoshop and quantitated using the NIH Image program. Relative intensity of the bands was calculated as percentage of the intensity of the protein band in cell lysates at time zero of the chase. To test for internalization of cystatin C from culture media, nontransfected cells were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C with media of stably transfected [35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled cells, which were harvested 3 h into the chase. The incubation was performed in the presence or absence of 42 μm leupeptin, a lysosomal protease inhibitor. To determine the proteolytic effects of conditioned media on cystatin C in the absence of cells, media that had been conditioned by different nontransfected cell lines for 48–72 h were mixed with media of stably transfected [35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled cells, that were harvested 3 h into the chase (1:1 to 25:1 volumes). The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C in the presence or absence of protease inhibitors. As a control, media of labeled cells were mixed with medium never exposed to cells. Media of labeled cells were also mixed with normal CSF. Cystatin C was immunoprecipitated from the various mixtures and analyzed by gel electrophoresis as described above. The labeled bands were scanned using Adobe Photoshop and quantitated using the NIH Image program. Relative intensity of the bands was calculated as percentage of the intensity of the protein band at the beginning of the incubation (time zero). In order to examine the production, secretion, and stability of wild type and variant cystatin C, human astrocytic glioma U251 and human kidney 293 cell lines were stably transfected with the cystatin C genes. Immunoblot analysis of cell homogenates and culture media of the transfected cells separated under reducing conditions revealed a band of approximately 14 kDa, corresponding to cystatin C (Fig.2). Similar results were obtained under nonreducing conditions. Analysis of cell homogenates of several stably transfected cell lines, with high levels of overexpression of cystatin C, showed a band of approximately 28 kDa in addition to the 14-kDa band. The higher molecular weight band may represent a dimeric form of cystatin C. A single 14-kDa band corresponding to the monomeric protein was observed in culture media of all these cell lines. Sequence analysis of the cystatin C forms produced and secreted by the cells transfected with the wild type or variant genes revealed only full-length cystatin C, starting at Ser1, in cell lysates and conditioned media (Fig. 1). Even when media conditioned for 24 h by cells stably transfected with the wild type gene were harvested and incubated at 37 °C or room temperature for 4 days, no NH2-terminal decapeptide truncation was observed. Similarly, we found only the full-length protein in CSF of normal individuals. Parallel analysis of the inhibitory activity of the normal and variant cystatin C from tissue culture media revealed that both proteins effectively inhibited the proteolytic activity of the cathepsins secreted by the cells (data not shown). This is in agreement with previous reports demonstrating that the amino acid substitution does not significantly affect the inhibitory activity of the full-length recombinant cystatin C (25Abrahamson M. Grubb A.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1416-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Analysis of cell homogenates and culture media of the cystatin C-transfected cell lines by mass spectrometry revealed proteins consistent with the mass of wild type and variant cystatin C (13,343 and 13,362 daltons, respectively). Cell homogenates also contained proteins with mass corresponding to the exact double of these molecular weights (Fig. 3). These results are consistent with the immunoblot observation that cell homogenates with high concentration of cystatin C contained a dimeric form of cystatin C. To study the effect of cystatin C concentration on dimerization, samples containing increasing amounts of purified proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis under reducing conditions. A single 14-kDa band corresponding to the monomeric protein was observed in samples containing low protein concentration (Fig.4). Increased concentration of cystatin C resulted in the appearance of a 28-kDa band, representing the dimeric form of cystatin C (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the HCHWA-I variant of cystatin C formed dimers at lower concentrations (75–100 ng) than the wild type protein (250–500 ng). These data demonstrate that both the wild type and variant cystatin C proteins form concentration-dependent dimers resistant to dissociation by β-mercaptoethanol and SDS. Congo Red staining did not reveal intracellular or extracellular staining in any of the cells cultured for up to 8 days (data not shown). Therefore, it seems that neither the normal nor the variant cystatin C proteins accumulated or formed fibrils in the cells or culture media in the conditions and cell types studied. To examine the temporal profile of cystatin C production and secretion, pulse-chase studies were carried out. Cells were metabolically radiolabeled for 20 min by the addition of [35S]methionine/cysteine to the medium followed by chase for various lengths of time. Both normal and variant cystatin C were expressed and cleared from the cells at the same rate and to a similar extent (Fig. 5). The levels of the normal and variant cystatin C secreted into the culture media were similar, with maximum accumulation by about 3 h into the chase. However, while the normal cystatin C secreted into the culture media was stable for at least 5 days, the levels of the mutated protein were reduced in the media, and only traces were observed after 2 days of chase (Fig.6). It should be noted that the cells were viable and metabolically active during the entire treatment course, and levels of other proteins remained unchanged over the same period, indicating that cellular death or general proteolysis were not responsible for the observed decrease in variant cystatin C.Figure 6The variable stability of the secreted cystatin C in culture media. Stably transfected human tissue culture cells were labeled with [35S]methionine/cysteine for 20 min and chased for different time periods. Cell lysates and media proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-cystatin C antibody, separated on Tricine-Tris-PAGE, and exposed to x-ray films. The protein bands were scanned and quantitated. Relative intensity of the bands was calculated as percentage of the intensity of the protein band of cell lysates at the beginning of the chase (time 0). The results from a single representative experiment are presented. Less than 10% variation was observed between experiments. □, normal cystatin C in cell lysates; ⋄, normal cystatin C in medium; •, variant cystatin C in cell lysates; ▴, variant cystatin C in medium.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether the wild type and variant cystatin C are transported via the same intracellular pathway, pulse-chase experiments were carried out in the presence of brefeldin A or at low temperature. Brefeldin A blocks protein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum and causes redistribution of Golgi components to the endoplasmic reticulum (29De Lemos-Chiarandini C. Ivessa E. Black V.H. Tsao Y.S. Gumper I. Kreibich G. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 58: 187-201PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, low temperature greatly reduces transport through the endoplasmic reticulum. Both brefeldin A and low temperature blocked the secretion of normal and variant cystatin C into the culture media (Fig.7). These data suggest that both the wild type and variant proteins are produced and transported by the same intracellular constitutive secretory pathway. The reduction in the secreted variant cystatin C may be due to either uptake by cells or extracellular degradation. Since no increase in cellular protein was observed over time (Fig. 6), the variant of cystatin C does not appear to be removed by cellular uptake. To confirm this observation, nontransfected cells were incubated with [35S]methionine/cysteine-labeled media of cells stably transfected with the normal or variant genes. No internalized cystatin C was observed. Since the majority of the internalized proteins are degraded in lysosomes, the experiment was performed in the presence of leupeptin, a lysosomal serine and cysteine protease inhibitor (30Busca R.

Recently, several new and specific thymidylate synthase inhibitors that occupy the folate binding site, including Tomudex®, BW1843U89, and Thymitaq, have demonstrated therapeutic activity in patients with advanced cancer. In order to find drug-resistant forms of human thymidylate synthase for gene therapy applications, human sarcoma HT1080 cells were exposed to ethyl methanesulfonate and Thymitaq selection. Thymitaq-resistant clonal derived sublines were established, and analysis indicated that both gene amplification and point mutations contributed to drug resistance. Eight mutant cDNAs that were identified from Thymitaq-resistant sublines were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and transfected into thymidylate synthase-negative cells. Only K47E, D49G, or G52S mutants retain enzyme activity. Moreover, cytotoxicity studies demonstrated that D49G and G52S transfected cells, besides displaying resistance to Thymitaq with IC50 values 40- and 12-fold greater than wild-type enzyme transfected cells, respectively, also lead to fluorodeoxyuridine resistance (26- and 97-fold in IC50 values, respectively) but not to Tomudex or BW1843U89. Characterization of the purified altered enzymes obtained from expression in Escherichia coli is consistent with the cell growth inhibition results. We postulate that the D49G or G52S mutation leads to the structural perturbation of the highly conserved Arg50 loop, decreasing the binding of thymidylate synthase to the inhibitors, Thymitaq and fluorodeoxyuridylate.

EC 2.1.1.45) catalyzes the de novo biosynthesis of thymidylate, which is necessary for DNA synthesis and repair (1Carreras C.W. Santi D.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 721-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (663) Google Scholar). The mechanism of TS activity involves the reductive methylation of the substrate, 2′-deoxyuridine 5′-monophosphate (dUMP) by transfer of a methylene group from the cofactor, 5,10-methylene-5,6,7,8-tetrahydrofolate (CH2H4folate), to generate 2′-deoxythymidine 5′-monophosphate (dTMP) and 7,8-dihydrofolate. Human TS has been sequenced (2Takeishi K. Kaneda S. Ayusawa D. Shimizu K. Gotoh O. Seno T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 2035-2043Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), purified (3Davisson V.J.

Biol. 1991; 219: 161-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). As an attractive target for anti-cancer drug design, since the 1950s, many TS analogues of both the substrate, dUMP, and the cofactor, CH2H4folate, have been synthesized and tested as potential anti-cancer therapeutics. Until recently, 5-fluorouracil and fluorodeoxyuridine (FdUrd) were the sole TS-targeted drugs approved for clinical application. In vivo, 5-fluorouracil and FdUrd are metabolized to 5-fluoro-2-deoxyuridylate (FdUMP), a compound that subsequently occupies the pyrimidine binding site forming a ternary complex with TS and the folate cofactor, resulting in inhibition of enzyme function. The recent determination of the three-dimensional structure of human TS has allowed the design of highly specific inhibitors, leading to the emergence of novel folate analogues, such as Tomudex (ZD1694), BW1843U89, and Thymitaq (AG337) (Fig.1) (6Schiffer C.A. Clifton I.J. Davisson V.J. Santi D.V. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16279-16287Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). These promising compounds have entered clinical trials in recent years (7Jackman A.L. Calvert A.H. Ann. Oncol. 1995; 6: 871-881Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Previous studies have attempted to correlate enzyme structure and function using mutagenesis. To date, a large number of mutations have been made in Lactobacillus. casei and Escherichia coli TS (1Carreras C.W. Santi D.V. Annu. Rev.

In most reports, the procedures included the following two steps: generated mutants were first screened for their enzyme activity by genetic complementation in a TS-deficient E. coli host in the absence of thymine, and kinetic characterizationsin vitro were subsequently performed for functional mutants. A few mutants of human TS and their expressed enzymes in mammalian cells have been studied (10Barbour K.W. Berger S.H. Berger F.G. Mol.

The Y33H human TS mutant, the only mutation in TS reported to be related to TS-directed drug resistance, was discovered in a human colon tumor cell line and conferred approximately a 3–4-fold resistance to FdUrd (10Barbour K.W. Berger S.H. Berger F.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1990; 37: 515-518PubMed Google Scholar, 11Barbour K.W. Hoganson D.K. Berger S.H. Berger F.G. Mol.

This mutation was reported to affect the catalytic properties of human TS enzyme, showing an 8-fold decrease in k cat but without significant change in the K m values for both dUMP and CH2H4folate between the mutant and wild-type TS. As point mutations in human TS leading to the generation of antifolate-resistant genes have not yet been reported, an important goal of this work was to obtain human TS mutants conferring resistance to novel antifolates with minimal changes in the catalytic activity of the altered enzymes. Such mutants would be of much interest both for understanding structure-function for human TS and for their potential applications in gene therapy by protecting hematopoietic progenitors from TS inhibitor toxicity. In the present study, we generated TS mutants from human sarcoma HT1080 cells following ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) exposure and Thymitaq selection. Clonal sublines containing these mutations were identified by DNA-SSCP and sequencing. These mutant cDNAs were cloned into mammalian expression vectors and transfected into mouse TS-negative cells for cytotoxicity assays. The relevant enzymes were expressed inE. coli purified and characterized by kinetic studiesin vitro. Ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) was supplied by Sigma. The TransformerTM site-directed mutagenesis kit was purchased from CLONTECH Laboratories, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). The bacterial expression plasmid pET-17×b and competentE. coli BL21(DE3) cells were from Novagen, Inc. (Madison, WI). The mammalian expression vector pcDNA3 was from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). DEAE-cellulose (DE52) was from Whatman, and phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B was from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Oligonucleotide primers were synthesized by either IDT, Inc. (Coralville, IA), or Operon Technologies, Inc. (Alameda, CA). Human recombinant TS cDNA modified to enhance expression (15Pedersen-Lane J. Maley G.F. Chu E. Maley F. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) when placed in bacterial expression vector pET-17×b (named pET-17×b (hTS)) was kindly provided by Dr. Frank Maley (New York Health Department, Albany, NY). Alamar Blue was from Alamar Biosciences, Inc. (Sacramento, CA). Thymitaq (AG337) was a generous gift of Agouron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (San Diego, CA). (6R,6S)-CH2H4folate was synthesized by Dr. B. Schircks Laboratories (Jona, Switzerland). Tomudex (ZD1694) was a kind gift from Zeneca (Macclesfield, UK). BW1843U89 was supplied by Glaxo-Wellcome (Research Triangle Park, NC). Human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Stock cultures of the parental cell line HT1080 and resistant sublines were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mml-glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. The TS-negative cell line FSthy21, a kind gift of Dr. T. Seno (9Michaels M.L. Kim C.W. Matthews D.A. Miller J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3957-3961Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), was originally established from mouse FM3A cells. FSthy21 cells were grown in Eagle's minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, 1 μm 5-CHO-tetrahydrofolate, and 10 μm thymidine. Prototrophic transformant clones, derived from FSthy21 cells by transfection of wild-type or mutant human TS cDNAs, were cultured in the same medium as mentioned above without thymidine and reduced folate supplements. In order to determine the optimum concentration of EMS and Thymitaq for random mutagenesis experiments, we first carried out the cytotoxicity assay of human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells with EMS or Thymitaq. IC50values and the minimal concentration of EMS or Thymitaq that resulted in no colony formation in HT1080 cells were obtained by plots of colonies surviving versus various EMS or Thymitaq concentrations. HT1080 cells (50 ml, total 4 × 108 cells) growing in logarithmic phase were exposed to EMS (400 μg/ml) for 18 h. The cells were washed and then incubated for an additional 3 days in EMS-free medium to allow phenotypic expression. EMS-treated cells were subcultured at 6 × 107 cells/100-mm dishes in 15 ml of medium and then grown in the presence of 40 μmThymitaq for 14 days. Surviving clones obtained from EMS exposure and Thymitaq selection were isolated with a ring cylinder and expanded into stable resistant sublines. Control cells were treated with Thymitaq without EMS exposure (16Ayusawa D. Koyama H. Iwata K. Seno T. Somatic. Cell Genet. 1981; 7: 523-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 17Fanin R.

RNA from the HT1080 cells and resistant sublines was isolated, and first-strand cDNAs were synthesized by reverse transcriptase-PCR. For DNA-SSCP analysis, TS fragments (150–260 bp) were obtained by PCR amplification using the cDNAs as the template and 6 pairs of TS-specific primers (the sequences of oligonucleotide primers used in various experiments such as PCR amplification, DNA-SSCP, and sequence analysis are described in TableI). The reaction mixture containing 1 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP and a small volume (3 μl) of final PCR products was subsequently mixed with 10 μl of loading buffer containing 96% formamide. Samples were denatured at 94 °C for 3 min and chilled on ice for at least 5 min, and 2 μl was loaded onto a 6–8% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel with 10% glycerol. Gels were electrophoresed at 10 watts for 6–8 h at 4 °C, using 0.5× Tris borate/EDTA buffer. The separated single strand DNA fragments were visualized by autoradiography.Table IThe sequences of oligonucleotides used for PCR amplification, DNA-SSCP screen, and sequence analysisOligonucleotide primersSequence of oligonucleotidesAnnealing codon to human TShTS-1AaA represents sense, and B indicates antisense.5′ CACAGGAGCGGGACGCCGAG 3′ntbnt, nucleotides. 50–69hTS-1B5′ CAAAAAGTCTCGGGATCCATT 3′nt 354–334hTS-2A5′ GAGCTGTCTTCCAAGGGAGTGA 3′nt 298–319hTS-2B5′ TCTCTGGTACAGCTGGCAGGACAG 3′nt 645–622hTS-3A5′ CTGCCAGTTCTATGTGGTGAACAGTG 3′nt 594–616HTS-3B5′ AACAGCCATTTCCATTTTAATAGT 3′nt 939–915hTS-4A5′ TACCTGGGGCAGATCCAACAC 3′nt 97–117hTS-4B5′ TTCATCTCTCAGGCTGTAGCGCG 3′nt 210–188hTS-5A5′ TCAGATTATTCAGGACAGGGAGTTG 3′nt 451–475hTS-5B5′ ATGGTGTCAATCACTCTTTGCAG 3′nt 503–481hTS-6A5′ GGGAGATGCACATATTTACCTGAA 3′nt 756–779hTS-6B5′ TCTGGGTTCTCGCTGAAGCT 3′nt 822–803a A represents sense, and B indicates antisense.b nt, nucleotides. Open table in a new tab An alternative method (nonisotopic SSCP) was also utilized in which the single strand DNA bands are detected by ethidium bromide staining instead of autoradiography. At least 40 ng (20 μl) of amplified DNA was denatured by addition of 1 μg of 0.5 m NaOH, 10 mm EDTA at 42 °C for 5 min. Before loading, 1 μl of formamide containing 0.5% bromphenol blue and 0.5% xylene cyanol were added. Non-denaturing gels (1.5 mm thick, 6–8% polyacrylamide) with 5% glycerol were made in a standard vertical gel apparatus. Gels, using 0.5× TBE as running buffer, were electrophoresed at 15 V/cm for 4 h, and the temperature was maintained at 4 °C by circulating cold water. Finally, SSCP gels were neutralized and stained in 0.5× TBE containing 0.5 μg/ml ethidium bromide for visualization of band. The reverse transcriptase-PCR fragments exhibiting abnormal mobility on SSCP gels were subsequently subcloned into pCR-ScriptTM SK(+) vector, which permits the efficient cloning of PCR fragments with a high yield and sequencing by two commercially designed primers (M3 (−20) and M13 reverse). Sequence analysis was performed by the dideoxy chain termination method with α-35S-dATP using modified T7 DNA polymerase according to the manufacture's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The human TS probe, which was 32P-labeled by random primer DNA labeling kit (Boehringer Mannheim), was a 950-bp gel-purified fragment of human TS cDNA cleaved from the pET-17×b(hTS) plasmid withNdeI and HindIII restriction enzymes (15Pedersen-Lane J. Maley G.F. Chu E. Maley F. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). As a loading control, a γ-actin cDNA probe was used for Southern blotting and ribosomal phosphoprotein 36B4 was for Northern blotting. To detect the expressed levels of human TS protein, Western blots were probed with a rabbit anti-human TS polyclonal antibody (a generous gift of Dr. Frank Maley) and incubated with goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody. Finally, the protein bands were visualized by the ECL method using a kit from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. The vector pcDNA3 under T7 promoter control was used to obtain a mammalian expression system for human TS. The construction of the plasmid containing recombinant human TS cDNA was performed by digestion of pET-17×b(hTS) withNdeI and HindIII to generate a 950-bp fragment containing a full cDNA sequence of human TS. After treatment with T4 DNA polymerase to create blunt ends, the 950-bp DNA fragment was ligated to the unique EcoRV site of pcDNA3 vector to produce the pcDNA3-hTS plasmid. The correct size (6.4 kilobase pairs) and orientation was confirmed by restriction mapping and sequencing. The TransformerTM site-directed mutagenesis kit was used to obtain point mutations in human TS. The mutagenic and selective primers used for site-directed mutagenesis experiments are described in TableII. A selection primer that contains a unique KspI restriction site instead of the uniqueSmaI restriction site on the pcDNA3 vector is shown last, and the other 8 primers were designed to generate mutants of the human TS gene at the targeted site with 1 to 3 nucleotide changes. Mutant human TS cDNA was obtained by annealing one mutagenic primer and one selection primer to the single strand pcDNA3-hTS plasmid. The experimental procedures followed the manufacturer's instructions. The resulting colonies were initially screened using KspI digestion that only cuts newly synthesized plasmids. Plasmids with correct point mutations in human TS were examined further by restriction mapping and DNA sequencing.Table IIOligonucleotide primers used for site-directed mutagenesisOligonucleotide primersSequencesaThe mismatches to wild type directing the codon changes are underlined.Amino acid changedK47E5′ GCGGCGTCAGGGAGGACGACCGC 3′Lys47 → GluD49G5′ TCAGGAAGGACGGCCGCACGGGCAC 3′Asp49 → GlyD49N5′ GTCAGGAAGGACAACCGCACGGGCA 3′Asp49 → AsnR50C5′ AGGAAGGACGACTGCACGGGCACCG 3′Arg50 → CysT51A5′ AAGGACGACCGCGCGGGCACCGGCA 3′Thr51 → AlaG52S5′ GACGACCGCACGAGCACCGGCACCCT 3′Gly52 → SerF59L5′ ACCCTGTCGGTACTCGGCATGCAGG 3′Phe59 → LeuQ214R5′ TGCCAGCTGTACCGGAGATCGGGAGA 3′Gln214 → ArgpcDNA3bSelection primer for destroying the unique SmaI restriction site to generate another unique KspI site on pcDNA3 vector.5′ CAAAAAGCTCCGCGGAGCTTGTATA 3′SmaI →KspIa The mismatches to wild type directing the codon changes are underlined.b Selection primer for destroying the unique SmaI restriction site to generate another unique KspI site on pcDNA3 vector. Open table in a new tab The mouse TS-negative FSthy21 cells were used as host for DNA transfections that were performed using a DOTAP transfection kit (Boehringer Mannheim). Three days after transfection, cells were placed in selective media, which lacked thymidine and reduced folate. Surviving cells having the ability to grow in the absence of thymidine were cloned in soft agarose. Cloned logarithmically growing suspension mouse TS-negative FSthy21 cells transfected with either wild-type or variant human TS cDNA were seeded in 96-well plates at 2,000 cells/well in 180 μl of complete medium. Two hours later, drug (Tomudex, Thymitaq, BW1843U89, or FdUrd) was added, and the cells were grown in drug-containing medium for an additional 7 days. Cell viability was measured by the Alamar BlueTM assay. To the above 96-well cultured cells, 25 μl of Alamar Blue (10% of incubation volume) was added according to the manufacturer's instructions. The 96-well plates were then incubated at 37 °C for 4 h. Viable cells induce chemical reduction of the media which results in a change in color from blue to red. The intensity of red color (and fluorescence) is proportional to the number of viable cells. After incubation, fluorescence was read at 530–560 nm excitation wavelength and 590 nm emission wavelength by an automated plate reader (model EL340; Bio-Tek). Drug concentrations needed to reduce cell growth by 50% (IC50 values) were determined graphically by plotting cell growth versusinhibitor concentrations. Human TS variants (G52S and D49G) selected for enzyme kinetic characterization were recloned into the protein expression vector pET-17×b. DNA fragments carrying the entire mutant human TS cDNA were amplified using the corresponding pcDNA3-hTS vector as the template and two primers designed to contain appropriate restriction site for cloning. The 5′-primer (5′ GGAATTCTGCAGCATATGCTTGTTGC 3′) contains a created NdeI restriction site, and the 3′-primer (5′ CTAGATGCATGCTCGAGCGGCCGCC 3′) has an XhoI site. After PCR amplification, the reaction mixture was digested with NdeI and XhoI enzymes, and the restricted DNA fragment (950 bp) was inserted into the corresponding sites of pET-17b vector. The correct construction of mutant pET-17b(hTS) was verified by restriction mapping and sequence analysis. The protein expression pET-17×b(hTS) plasmid (wild-type or mutant TS) was used to transform E. coli strain BL21(DE3). Bacterial cells were grown at 30 °C in 1 liter of tryptone phosphate medium (2% bacto-tryptone, 1.5% yeast extract, 0.2% sodium phosphate (dibasic), 0.1% potassium phosphate (monobasic), 0.8% sodium chloride, and 0.2% glucose) supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin (18Moore J.T. Uppal A. Maley F. Maley G.F. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 160-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The wild-type and the two mutant TSs were induced with 1 mm isopropyl-β-thiogalactose for 5 h at which point the enzyme was induced to about 10–15% of the soluble protein. The purification procedures were basically carried out as described by Ciesla et al. (19Ciesla J. Weiner K.X.B. Weiner R.S. Reston J.T. Maley G.F. Maley F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1261: 233-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) for rat TS purification, which included streptomycin treatment of crude extract, followed by ammonium sulfate precipitation, ion-exchange cellulose DE-52, and phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B chromatography. A minor modification was made by eluting TS protein from a phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column with a decreasing linear gradient of ammonium sulfate from 0.8 mm to 0 instead of 0.8 to 0.4 mm. Finally, TS fractions were precipitated with solid ammonium sulfate and stored at −80 °C until use. TS purity was demonstrated by 12% SDS-PAGE. TS activity was monitored spectrophotometrically at 340 nm as described previously (20Wahba A.J. Friedkin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: 11-12Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar, 21Pogolotti A.L. Danenberg P.V. Santi D.V. J. Med. Chem. 1986; 29: 478-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The assay mixture contained 50 mm Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, 25 mm MgCl2, 6.5 mm formaldehyde, 1 mm EDTA, 75 mm β-mercaptoethanol, and 100 μm dUMP; CH2H4folate (200 μm) was added to initiate the reaction at 30 °C. Michaelis constants (K m ) for CH2H4folate and dUMP were determined from initial velocity measurements, which were obtained by measuring the change in A 340 with a Shimadzu UV-2101 PC spectrophotometer. For determination of K m of CH2H4folate, the concentration of dUMP was fixed at 500 μm, whereas CH2H4folate concentrations were varied between 5 and 600 μm. For determination of K m of dUMP, CH2H4folate was present at a concentration of 600 μm, and dUMP was varied between 1 and 300 μm. Steady-state kinetic parameters were subsequently obtained by a nonlinear least squares fit of the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using a computer program.k cat (s−1) values were obtained by dividing V max (μmol/min/mg protein) by the estimated concentration of enzyme (μmol) used in the reaction. Inhibition constants (K i ) were determined from the steady-state inhibition reaction rates for mixtures of enzyme, dUMP, CH2H4folate, and inhibitor. A high fixed CH2H4folate concentration (600–800 μm) and variable antifolate concentrations were used to measure the inhibition produced by Tomudex, Thymitaq, and BW1843U89. A constant dUMP concentration (500 μm) was used, and FdUMP concentrations were varied to measure inhibition by FdUMP. Based on EMS and Thymitaq cytotoxicity assays, a concentration of 400 μg/ml EMS that resulted in 80% inhibition of colony formation and 40 μm Thymitaq, approximately 20-fold higher than IC50 value for this compound, were chosen for selection of resistant clones. Following EMS exposure and Thymitaq selection, a relatively large number of resistant clones (41 per 4 × 108 cells) were generated in comparison with no EMS pretreatment but selected in Thymitaq (1 per 108 cells), indicating that EMS increased the frequency of surviving Thymitaq-resistant clones by approximately 10-fold. All 41 of these clones from EMS and Thymitaq treatment and 1 clone from a control experiment without EMS were expanded to establish stable Thymitaq-resistant cell lines, which were grown in the presence of 40 μm Thymitaq. To detect putative point mutations leading to drug resistance, all 41 EMS-exposed Thymitaq-resistant cell lines and one control-resistant cell line (HT1080-A, without EMS treatment) were investigated by SSCP analysis. After total RNA isolation and reverse transcription, fragments that include most of the entire coding sequence of human TS gene except nucleotides 1–69 and 915–939 were amplified by 6 pairs of primers. DNA-SSCP screening demonstrated that shifted bands in addition to normal migrating bands were observed on SSCP gels for nine EMS-exposed Thymitaq-resistant cell lines (HT1080–1b, -2b, -1c, -2c, -1d, -2d, -1e, -2e, and -6e), indicating the possible presence of mutations in these fragments (Fig.2). Western blotting revealed that some resistant sublines (HT1080-A, -1b, -2b, -2c, -2d, -2e, and -6e) demonstrated elevation of protein levels, and modest increases in TS genomic DNA were also seen in these sublines by Southern blotting. The corresponding mRNA levels were observed to increase in only HT1080–2c, -2d, and -2e sublines as determined by Northern blotting, using ribosomal phosphoprotein 36B4 mRNA as controls. In contrast, some sublines (HT1080–1c, -1d, and -1e) did not amplify the TS gene and nor did they overexpress TS mRNA and protein (Fig. 3). The fragments produced by PCR amplifications with abnormal migration on SSCP gels were cloned into pCR-Script vector for sequencing. More than 20 mutations including some silent mutations in the 9 Thymitaq-resistant cell lines were identified, which are Q214R, A228T, and K266I mutations from HT1080-1b; I40T and D49N from HT1080-2b; T51A from HT1080-1d; R25H and F59L from HT1080-2d; G52S from HT1080-1e; D49G, D130G, and T234M from HT1080-2e; and K47E, R50C, Y65C, V79M, and V84A from HT1080-6e (the G52S mutation as an example is shown in Fig.4). The results combining Western and SSCP analyses indicated that human TS protein overexpression and mutations in the TS coding region were both present in the same cell lines. No mutations were detected in the untreated HT1080 cell line or in the HT1080-A line that was obtained by Thymitaq selection without EMS exposure. To determine whether only single point mutations result in changes in Thymitaq binding to TS, we expressed mutant TS genes with only single point mutations. The human TS expression vector pcDNA3-hTS, which contains the entire coding sequence of the human TS gene with minor modifications of the N-terminal nucleotide codon, was utilized for these studies (15Pedersen-Lane J. Maley G.F. Chu E. Maley F. Protein Expression Purif. 1997; 10: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Eight TS mutants, including K47E, D49N, D49G, R50C, T51A, G52S, F59L, and Q214R detected in the resistant subline analysis, were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using pcDNA3-hTS as a template. These mutations were selected from the 20 or more mutations found, based on their occurrence in highly conserved regions of this enzyme (Table III). Sequencing the coding regions demonstrated that the expected substitution had been introduced and that no other alteration had occurred (data not shown).Table IIIAmino acids in human TS that are highly conserved and important for ligand bindingPositions in human and corresponding L. casei thymidylate synthaseSequence conservation among 29 TS speciesInteractions with CH2H4folate or dUMPLys47/Lys20Invariant in vertebratesArg50 loopAsp49/Asp22Strictly invariantArg50loopArg50/Arg23Highly conserved with two exceptions (Gly)Hydrogen bond with dUMP and C terminusThr51/Thr24Highly conserved with one exceptions (Gln)Arg50 loopGly52/His25Highly conserved with five exceptions (two His, Arg, Met, and Pro)Arg50 loopPhe59/Phe32Highly conserved with two exceptions (Met and Thr)β-Sheet i, forming part of the substrate binding pocketGln214/Gln217Highly conserved with one exception (Ala)β-Sheet iii, a kick region for three β-sheet formation Open table in a new tab Transfection of the eight human TS variants as generated above into TS-negative mouse cells was used to demonstrate whether or not the altered"
https://openalex.org/W2002586202,"TOM22 is an integral component of the preprotein translocase of the mitochondrial outer membrane (TOM complex). The protein is anchored to the lipid bilayer by a central trans-membrane segment, thereby exposing the amino-terminal domain to the cytosol and the carboxyl-terminal portion to the intermembrane space. Here, we describe the sequence requirements for the targeting and correct insertion of Neurospora TOM22 into the outer membrane. The orientation of the protein is not influenced by the charges flanking its trans-membrane segment, in contrast to observations regarding proteins of other membranes. In vitro import studies utilizing TOM22 preproteins harboring deletions or mutations in the cytosolic domain revealed that the combination of the trans-membrane segment and intermembrane space domain of TOM22 is not sufficient to direct import into the outer membrane. In contrast, a short segment of the cytosolic domain was found to be essential for the import and assembly of TOM22. This sequence, a novel internal import signal for the outer membrane, carries a net positive charge. A mutant TOM22 in which the charge of the import signal was altered to −1 was imported less efficiently than the wild-type protein. Our data indicate that TOM22 contains physically separate import and membrane anchor sequences.

The biogenesis of mitochondria requires products of both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes (1Attardi G. Schatz G. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 289-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar). The nuclear-encoded proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and contain signals that direct them to the organelle and to their specific intramitochondrial subcompartments (2Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar, 3Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31763-31766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The targeting signals in matrix-destined preproteins are cleavable, positively charged, amino-terminal presequences that have the potential to form amphipathic α-helices (4von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar, 5Roise D. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4509-4511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In cooperation with internal topogenic signals (6Stuart R. Neupert W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 261-267Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), this type of targeting signal also directs some proteins to the inner membrane and the intermembrane space. In contrast to the extensive data regarding amino-terminal presequences, there is limited information about the signals that direct proteins to the outer membrane, and, via presequence-independent mechanisms, to the inner membrane and the intermembrane space. In most cases, these signals are not cleaved after import, and may be located internally (2Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar, 3Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31763-31766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial outer membrane contains several proteins that are anchored in the lipid bilayer via a single trans-membrane segment, exposing domains to the cytosol and/or the intermembrane space (7Kutay U.

Chem. 1995; 270: 5674-5679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Tom6 harbors additional targeting information that does not overlap with the trans-membrane segment (17Cao W. Douglas M.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). During import of Tom70 (9Hase T. Riezman H. Suda K. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1983; 2: 2169-2172Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), Bcl-2 (18Tsujimoto Y. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3023-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), segments of less than 11 residues cross the outer membrane. To investigate the targeting signals in proteins which possess larger domains that must traverse the membrane, we have chosen to study TOM22 of the Neurospora crassa TOM complex. The amino-terminal 84 residues of TOM22 are exposed to the cytosol and the carboxyl-terminal domain of 49 amino acid residues is localized to the intermembrane space (19Kiebler M. Keil P. Schneider H. van der Klei I. Pfanner N. Neupert W. Cell. 1993; 74: 483-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Essential targeting and/or assembly information in TOM22 does not reside in the intermembrane space segment of the protein, because truncated TOM22 preproteins lacking this domain are efficiently imported into mitochondria (20Court D.A. Nargang F.E. Steiner H. Hodges R.S. Neupert W. Lill R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4035-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 21Nakai M. Kinoshita K. Endo T. J. Biol.

Biol. 1997; 17: 6574-6584Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In the current study, we investigated the role of the cytosolic domain in the import of TOM22 into mitochondria. In addition to targeting signals, trans-membrane proteins contain information which determines their orientation across the bilayer. For instance, the orientation of Tom70 can be reversed, in the absence of a membrane potential, when its first 10 residues are replaced by a strong matrix-targeting signal (23Li J. Shore G.C. Science. 1992; 256: 1815-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24Steenaart N.A.E. Silvius J.R. Shore G.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3764-3771Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). The distribution of charges on either side of the membrane anchor is responsible for the orientation of proteins of the bacterial inner membrane (“positive-inside rule”) (25von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 487-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1406) Google Scholar) and the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (“charge-difference rule”) (26Hartmann E. Rapaport T.A. Lodish H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5786-5790Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar, 27Harley C.A. Tipper D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24625-24633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In both cases, the retention of a protein segment on the cis-side of the lipid bilayer correlates with the presence of positively charged residues on that side of the membrane anchor. The remainder of the protein is transported across the membrane. TOM22, with its internal membrane anchor, is an ideal model protein for the examination of the determinants of protein orientation across the mitochondrial outer membrane. The trans-membrane segment of TOM22 is flanked by a single positively charged residue on its cytosolic side and by two negatively charged residues on the intermembrane space side (19Kiebler M. Keil P. Schneider H. van der Klei I. Pfanner N. Neupert W. Cell. 1993; 74: 483-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Yeast Tom22 has a similar distribution of flanking charges, with a single charged residue on either side of the membrane anchor (28Lithgow T. Junne T. Suda K. Gratzer S. Schatz G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11973-11977Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 29Nakai M. Endo T. FEBS Lett. 1995; 357: 202-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 30Hönlinger A. Kübrich M. Moczko M. Gärtner F. Mallet L. Bussereau C. Eckerskorn F. Lottspeich K. Dietmeier K. Jacquet M. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3382-3389Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We tested the importance of the charged residues flanking the TOM22 trans-membrane segment for correct insertion of the protein into the outer membrane. The TOM22 derivatives used in this study were generated from the tom22 cDNA (19Kiebler M. Keil P. Schneider H. van der Klei I. Pfanner N. Neupert W. Cell. 1993; 74: 483-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Coding sequences for the truncated proteins TOM22Δ3–17 and TOM22Δ2–55 (see Fig. 3) were generated by amplification of the desired portion of the tom22 cDNA by a polymerase chain reaction. The resulting products were cloned into pGEM4 or pGEM2 (Promega). Thetom22Δ2–55 construct included the 16 bp upstream of the wild-type tom22 initiation codon to ensure efficientin vitro transcription and translation. The codon for residue four in this sequence was changed from CCC to CCT (both encoding proline) to avoid potential problems in the polymerase chain reaction. The tom22Δ3–17 coding sequence began with the initiation codon and did not require further upstream sequence for efficient expression. Coding sequences for the other mutant TOM22 proteins were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (31Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4905) Google Scholar) of the tom22 cDNA cloned plasmid pBluescript SK− (Stratagene), using the Muta-Gene phagemid mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad). The mutant tom22 coding sequences were recloned into pGEM4 or pGEM2 (Promega) forin vitro transcription. One class of mutant proteins (Fig. 3) carried the indicated internal deletions: TOM22Δ18–29, TOM22Δ30–44, TOM22Δ45–59, TOM22Δ61–75, and TOM22Δ77–84. A second class of TOM22 derivatives contained the following amino acid replacements: TOM22H66D/K67E, TOM22E106A/D107A, TOM22E106K/D107R (encoded by plasmid pNRC21, see below), TOM22R84G, and TOM22R84D (plasmid pNRC23). All mutant constructs were verified by DNA sequencing with the T7Sequencing Kit (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). The coding sequence for TOM22(105)Δ61–75 (Fig. 3) was generated by exchanging the appropriate BglI fragment from the plasmid encoding TOM22Δ61–75 with the corresponding fragment from the previously described plasmid encoding TOM22(105), in which the codon for residue 106 was converted to a stop codon through site-directed mutagenesis (20Court D.A. Nargang F.E. Steiner H. Hodges R.S. Neupert W. Lill R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4035-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, TOM22(105)Δ61–75 harbors a deletion of residues 61–75 and lacks the carboxyl-terminal 49 amino acid residues. The plasmid encoding TOM22R84D/E106K/D107R was generated by replacing the BglI fragment from pNRC23 with the corresponding fragment from pNRC21. Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)-TOM22(78–154) is composed of mouse DHFR fused on the amino-terminal side of residues 78–154 of TOM22. To create the corresponding coding sequence, a polymerase chain reaction-generated fragment encoding residues 78–154 of TOM22 was cloned in pGEM4. A BamHI site was introduced at the 5′ end of the tom22 sequence by the polymerase chain reaction primer. The BamHI-BglII fragment of the vector pQE-41 (Qiagen) containing the DHFR coding sequence was ligated into the BamHI site upstream of the tom22 sequence, fusing the DHFR and tom22 coding sequences in-frame and introducing an additional methionine residue at the junction of the two sequences. The wild-type laboratory strain, 74A, ofN. crassa was grown and maintained under standard conditions (32Davis R.H. De Serres F.J. Methods Enzymol. 1970; 17: 79-143Crossref Scopus (941) Google Scholar). Mitochondria were freshly isolated and used in standard import assays as described (20Court D.A. Nargang F.E. Steiner H.

Where indicated, mitochondria or outer membrane vesicles (see below) were treated with trypsin (20–40 μg/ml, 15 min, 0 °C) prior to the import reactions (20Court D.A. Nargang F.E. Steiner H. Hodges R.S. Neupert W. Lill R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4035-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 36Mayer A. Lill R. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Following the import reactions, the import of each TOM22 derivative was assessed by a protease protection assay (19Kiebler M. Keil P. Schneider H. van der Klei I. Pfanner N. Neupert W. Cell. 1993; 74: 483-492Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 35Keil P. Pfanner N. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). To confirm that TOM22 proteins were integrated into the membrane, duplicate import reactions were subjected to an alkaline extraction assay (20Court D.A. Nargang F.E. Steiner H. Hodges R.S. Neupert W. Lill R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4035-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the experiments involving DHFR-TOM22(78–154), the import reactions contained either vesicles derived from purified outer membranes (OMV) (36Mayer A. Lill R. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), or large unilamellar vesicles prepared by the extrusion technique (LUVET) (37MacDonald R.C. MacDonald R. Menco B.P.M. Takeshita K. Subbarao N.K. Hu L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1061: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (1394) Google Scholar). The LUVET were prepared from individual lipids purchased from Sigma. OM-LUVET had the same composition as outer membranes fromNeurospora mitochondria (38de Kroon A.I.P.M. Dolis D. Mayer A. Lill R. de Kruijff B. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1325: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar) (45% phosphatidylcholine, 29% phosphatidylethanolamine, 15% ergosterol, 8% phosphatidylinositol and 3% cardiolipin). PC/PE-LUVET were composed of 15% ergosterol, 52% phosphatidylcholine, and 33% phosphatidylethanolamine. The liposomes were reisolated after production, and at subsequent steps in the analysis, by centrifugation at 220,000 × g for 60 min at 2 °C. Import into OMV and LUVET was performed under standard conditions (36Mayer A. Lill R. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), with two alterations. First, each sample contained 10 μg of OMV protein or the corresponding amount of lipid (20 nmol of inorganic phosphate). Second, import into LUVET was carried out in EM buffer (1 mm EDTA, 10 mm MOPS, pH 7.5) to allow efficient reisolation of the LUVET after the reaction. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 500 μl of SEM buffer (220 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MOPS, ph 7.5) for OMV samples or EM buffer for LUVET. Following import, an alkaline-extraction assay was performed (36Mayer A. Lill R. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The following published or manufacturers' procedures were used: standard DNA manipulations (39Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Manitatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar), SDS-PAGE utilizing high Tris urea gels (40Swank R.T. Munkres K.D. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 39: 462-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1269) Google Scholar); blotting of proteins onto nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad); quantitation of radiolabeled proteins on dried gels and nitrocellulose membranes with a Fuji BAS-1500 Bioimaging analyzer. mRNA was prepared in vitro as described previously (41Söllner T. Rassow J. Pfanner N. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) or with the RibomaxTM system (Promega). Radiolabeled preproteins were synthesized in vitro as described elsewhere (41Söllner T. Rassow J. Pfanner N. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 34: 345-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), or with the TNT SP6-coupled reticulocyte lysate system (Promega), in the presence of [35S]methionine as a label. The importance of the charged residues flanking the trans-membrane segment of TOM22 for its import and correct assembly in the outer membrane was assayed by utilizing a series of mutant TOM22 preproteins in which one or both of these sets of flanking residues was replaced by either neutral amino acids, or ones of the opposite charge (Fig. 1). Radiolabeled preproteins were imported into mitochondria and their assembly into the outer membrane was assayed by partial digestion with proteinase K (protease protection assay). The pattern of proteolytic fragments generated from each of the TOM22 mutants resembled that of wild-type TOM22 (Fig. 1), indicating that each of these proteins became imported in the correct orientation. All preproteins were imported with approximately the same efficiency, with the exception of TOM22R84D which was reduced in import to about one-third of the wild-type TOM22 level. Complete reversal of the flanking charges had no effect on the orientation in the membrane and reduced import to about two-thirds of the wild-type level. In all cases, the protease-protected fragments were absent, or present at much lower levels, when trypsin-pretreated mitochondria were employed in the import reactions (Fig. 1, +pre-Tryp). This demonstrates that these mutant preproteins, like wild-type TOM22 (20Court D.A. Nargang F.E. Steiner H. Hodges R.S. Neupert W. Lill R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4035-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 35Keil P. Pfanner N. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), require the protease-sensitive components of the TOM complex for their import and are degraded by added protease if not assembled into the membrane. Therefore, the charges flanking the trans-membrane segment of TOM22 do not play an essential role in the orientation and assembly of this preprotein into the TOM complex. To determine whether the carboxyl-terminal portion of TOM22 functions as a mitochondrial signal anchor (11Hurt E.C. Pesold-Hurt B. Suda K. Opplinger W. Schatz G.

This fusion protein includes the trans-membrane segment and the intermembrane space domain of TOM22 (Fig.2 A). To avoid nonspecific integration of a signal anchor sequence into non-mitochondrial membranes that can contaminate normal mitochondrial preparations, the import reactions were performed using vesicles derived from highly purified outer membranes (OMV). The possibility of lipid-mediated insertion events was assayed in experiments utilizing artificial liposomes (LUVET) with the same lipid composition as mitochondrial outer membranes (OM-LUVET) (38de Kroon A.I.P.M. Dolis D. Mayer A. Lill R. de Kruijff B. Biochem. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1325: 108-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), or LUVET lacking negatively charged lipids (PC/PE-LUVET). In all cases, import was assayed using the alkaline extraction method, which removes all proteins that are not integrated into the membranes. Wild-type TOM22 was imported efficiently into intact OMV (Fig. 2 B) (36Mayer A. Lill R. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), but not into trypsin-pretreated OMV, OM-LUVET, or PC/PE-LUVET. Thus, in agreement with previous results using whole mitochondria (20Court D.A. Nargang F.E. Steiner H. Hodges R.S. Neupert W. Lill R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4035-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 35Keil P. Pfanner N. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), the integration of TOM22 into the outer membrane is strictly dependent on proteinaceous surface receptors. In contrast, the amount of DHFR-TOM22(78–154) recovered with intact OMV, and all other membranes tested, was barely above the background levels found in the absence of membranes (Fig. 2 B). We conclude that the carboxyl-terminal part of TOM22, comprising the trans-membrane segment and the intermembrane-space domain, is not sufficient to target a protein to the outer membrane. The targeting signal must therefore reside in the cytosolic domain. TOM22 preproteins harboring various deletions in their cytosolic domains (Fig.3) were utilized to investigate the role of this region of the protein in targeting and assembly of TOM22. Radiolabeled mutant preproteins were incubated with isolated mitochondria, and their import was assessed with the protease protection assay. A fragmentation pattern related to that of the intact TOM22 protein was generated, with similar efficiency, from TOM22Δ3–17, TOM22Δ18–29, and TOM22Δ30–44 (Fig.4 A). Minor qualitative differences in the patterns of fragments from the various mutants are most likely due to the distinct segment missing in each protein. The typical fragmentation patterns were not formed after import into trypsin-pretreated mitochondria (+pre-Tryp), demonstrating that these mutant proteins require protease-sensitive components of the TOM complex for their import (20Court D.A. Nargang F.E. Steiner H. Hodges R.S. Neupert W. Lill R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4035-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 35Keil P. Pfanner N. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). In contrast, TOM22Δ45–59 and TOM22Δ61–75 (Fig. 3) were not imported into mitochondria, as tested using both the protease protection assay (Fig. 4, A and B) and the alkaline extraction method (not shown). TOM22Δ77–84 (Fig.4 B), which harbors a deletion adjacent to the trans-membrane segment, was imported into mitochondria about 4-fold less efficiently than the wild-type TOM22 (Fig. 4 A). Together, these data indicate that the region bounded by residues 45–75, or certain residues within it, is essential for import, while residues between 77 and 84 enhance the efficiency of the process. We will refer to the segment encompassing residues 45–75 as the “import sequence.” The import of a mutant protein with a larger amino-terminal deletion, TOM22Δ2–55, was analyzed utilizing the protease protection assay (Fig. 4 B). A small fraction of TOM22Δ2–55 remained resistant to protease digestion after import into mitochondria. The apparent molecular mass of the protease-resistant protein did not change after digestion, even though the concentration of proteinase K utilized was sufficient to degrade TOM22Δ2–55 that had been incubated in import buffer in the absence of mitochondria (not shown). The low level of TOM22Δ2–55 remaining after protease treatment was also resistant to alkaline extraction (not shown), indicating that it represents imported protein. Together, these data indicate that residues 45–55 are important for the import of TOM22 along its normal import pathway, and suggest that an inefficient “bypass” mechanism (43Pfaller R. Pfanner N. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 34-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is responsible for the low level of membrane-associated TOM22Δ2–55. The reduced levels of import of TOM22Δ2–55 and TOM22Δ77–84 could be due to a rapid loss of import competence during incubation under import conditions. To rule out this possibility, time course experiments were performed. Both mutant preproteins were imported continuously throughout the time course, but to a lesser degree than the wild-type protein or other mutant forms such as TOM22Δ30–44 (Fig. 5). Thus, the reduced levels of import for TOM22Δ2–55 and TOM22Δ77–84 seen in Fig. 4 are not due to loss of import competence during the course of the experiments, but rather to an impairment of the import reactions. One notable feature of the TOM22 import sequence is its net positive charge (+2), particularly in comparison to the amino-terminal segment of the cytosolic domain of TOM22 (net charge −17, residues 1–44). To investigate the requirement for a net positive charge in the import sequence, we analyzed the import of TOM22H66D/K67E, in which the net charge of the import sequence was altered to −1. This protein was cleaved to produce the characteristic pattern of fragments (Fig.4 B) after in vitro import and treatment with proteinase K. However, the amount of protein imported was reduced about 5-fold in comparison to the wild-type protein and other mutants, such as TOM22Δ30–44 (Fig. 4 A). Continuous import at a decreased level occurred during the time course of the import reaction (Fig. 5). These findings are consistent with the interpretation that the positively charged character of the import sequence is required for efficient import in vitro. TOM22(105) lacks the carboxyl-terminal, intermembrane space domain and is efficiently imported via a mechanism that does not require the protease-sensitive receptors on the mitochondrial surface (20Court D.A. Nargang F.E. Steiner H. Hodges R.S. Neupert W. Lill R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4035-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The identification of the import sequence in the cytosolic domain of TOM22 allowed us to determine whether TOM22(105) is targeted to the outer membrane through a mechanism involving this signal. If this is the case, mutation of the import sequence in TOM22(105) should severely inhibit its import. To examine this question, we assessed the import competence of TOM22(105)Δ61–75, which lacks both the carboxyl-terminal domain and part of the import sequence (Fig. 3). Only a small fraction of this preprotein (approximately 2% of input) was imported into intact or trypsin-pretreated mitochondria (Fig.4 B). In contrast, TOM22(105) is efficiently imported into the organelles (40–60% of input) (20Court D.A. Nargang F.E. Steiner H. Hodges R.S. Neupert W. Lill R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4035-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Thus, the import sequence is also necessary for the efficient import of TOM22(105). TOM22, a bitopic mitochondrial outer membrane protein that exposes domains to both the cytosol and intermembrane space, contains an essential import sequence that is located in the cytosolic domain and encompasses residues 45–75. The segment containing residues 77–84 enhances the efficiency of import, but is not absolutely required for the process. The close proximity of the TOM22 import sequence and the trans-membrane segment are reminiscent of that of the corresponding sequences in the BCS1 protein of the mitochondrial inner membrane (44Fölsch H. Guiard B. Neupert W. Stuart R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 479-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). A hairpin structure formed between these two segments in BCS1 may be required for the import of the protein. By analogy, a similar structure could be formed in TOM22. The TOM22 import sequence resembles matrix-targeting presequences (4von Heijne G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar,5Roise D. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 4509-4511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in that it is enriched in serine, tyrosine, and threonine residues (a total of 11 out of 31), and is potentially amphipathic (45Eisenberg D. Weiss R. Terwilliger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 140-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the TOM22 import sequence carries a net positive charge which we have shown to be important for its function (Figs. 4 and 5). However, the import characteristics of TOM22(105) (20Court D.A. Nargang F.E. Steiner H. Hodges R.S. Neupert W. Lill R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4035-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) and TOM22(105)Δ61–75 (Fig. 4 B) indicate that the TOM22 import signal does not depend on the protease-sensitive receptors of the mitochondrial surface for its function, in striking contrast to matrix-targeting presequences (2Neupert W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 863-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (983) Google Scholar, 3Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31763-31766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). TOM22(105), unlike TOM22, is efficiently imported into mitochondria in the absence of the protease-sensitive components of the TOM complex (20Court D.A. Nargang F.E. Steiner H. Hodges R.S. Neupert W. Lill R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4035-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Therefore, assuming that TOM22(105) and TOM22 are imported along the same pathway, the import sequence must be able to function in the absence of surface receptors. To demonstrate that TOM22(105) requires the import sequence for its import, we deleted part of this signal from TOM22(105) to create TOM22(105)Δ61–75. This preprotein was not efficiently assembled into mitochondria (Fig. 4 B), indicating that the import sequence is required for the import of TOM22(105), and therefore can mediate this process without the participation of the surface receptors. With which components of the outer membrane does the TOM22 import sequence interact? The most likely candidates are the protease-resistant proteins of the TOM complex, such as the membrane-embedded TOM40 (46Rapaport D. Neupert W. Lill R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18725-18731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar) (reviewed in Lill and Neupert (47Lill R. Neupert W. Trends Cell Biol. 1996; 6: 56-61Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar)), or TOM5 (48Dietmeier K. Hönlinger A. Bömer U. Dekker P.J.T. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Kübrich M. Pfanner K. Nature. 1997; 388: 195-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Both proteins are in close contact with preproteins in transit across the outer membrane and are likely involved in protein transfer through the import pore. Interactions with the portions of the protease-sensitive TOM proteins that remain after tryptic digestion, or with outer membrane lipids, could also contribute to import. What is the role of the protease-sensitive components of the TOM complex in the import of wild-type TOM22? The requirement for these receptors in the import of TOM22 (35Keil P. Pfanner N. FEBS Lett. 1993; 321: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and some of its amino-terminal deletion derivatives (Fig. 4), but not of TOM22(105) (20Court D.A. Nargang F.E. Steiner H. Hodges R.S. Neupert W. Lill R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4035-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), indicates that this dependence is imparted by the carboxyl-terminal domain of the protein. Protease-sensitive receptors are required for efficient unfolding and translocation of other preproteins (49Mayer A. Neupert W. Lill R. Cell. 1995; 80: 127-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Thus, it is conceivable that interactions between TOM22 and the receptors position the carboxyl-terminus of TOM22 close to the translocation site and/or promote unfolding of this domain to facilitate its translocation through the import pore. Alternatively, interactions between the carboxyl-terminal domain and the receptors might be required to expose the import sequence for subsequent steps along the import pathway; this interaction would not be necessary in proteins such as TOM22(105) that lack the carboxyl-terminal domain. Interactions of TOM22 with components on the surface of the outer membrane could also determine the ultimate orientation of the protein, which was not influenced by alterations to the charge distribution across the trans-membrane segment (Fig. 1). A strong interaction between the TOM22 import sequence and the TOM complex could prevent translocation of the amino-terminal domain across the membrane. As such, the TOM22 import sequence would functionally resemble the amino-terminal “retention signals” created and analyzed by Shore and co-workers (23Li J. Shore G.C. Science. 1992; 256: 1815-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 24Steenaart N.A.E. Silvius J.R. Shore G.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 3764-3771Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) in their studies of Tom70. An alternative hypothesis (see 8), that a tightly folded cytosolic domain may not be amenable to translocation, seems unlikely for TOM22 because deletion of various segments of the amino-terminal domain had no effect on orientation. Finally, the preponderance of acidic residues in the amino-terminal domain could conceivably prevent its insertion into the negatively-charged outer membrane. This possibility is unlikely because deletion (Fig. 4) or replacement 2Nargang, F. E., Rapaport, D., Ritzel, R. G., Neupert, W., and Lill, R. (1998) Mol. Cell. Biol., in press. of many of these negative charges does not influence the final orientation of the protein in the outer membrane. TOM22 appears to be partitioned into functional units. The negatively charged, amino-terminal region is not required for import of TOM22 into the membrane. This domain appeares to be required for the proper function of TOM22 in the translocase complex (50Bolliger L. Junne T. Schatz G. Lithgow T. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 6318-6326Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), although the negative charges are not essential for this function.2 The positively charged portion of the cytosolic domain proximal to the trans-membrane segment harbors information essential for the import of TOM22 itself; the functional role of this domain in the import of other preproteins remains to be assessed. The trans-membrane segment anchors the protein to the outer membrane and is most likely involved in the formation of the import channel, as bypass import (43Pfaller R. Pfanner N. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 34-39Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) does not occur in mitochondria depleted of TOM22 (34Nargang F.E. Künkele K.-P. Mayer A. Ritzel G. Neupert W. Lill R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1099-1108Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Finally, the intermembrane space domain plays a role in the later stages of translocation across the outer membrane and in preprotein transfer to the inner membrane (20Court D.A. Nargang F.E.

Amino-terminal amino acid sequencing of the heavy chain cleavage product indicates cleavage of protein S by factor Xa at Arg60, a site that is distinct from those utilized by α-thrombin. Cleavage by factor Xa is unaffected by the presence of hirudin and is completely blocked by tick-anticoagulant-peptide andd-Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethyl ketone, the latter two being specific inhibitors of factor Xa. The cleavage requires the presence of phospholipid and Ca2+, and is markedly inhibited by the presence of factor Va. Factor Xa-cleaved protein S no longer possesses its activated protein C-dependent or -independent anticoagulant activity, as measured in a factor VIII-based activated partial thromboplastin time clot assay. The apparent binding constant for protein S binding to phospholipid (K d ≃ 4 nm ± 1.0) is unaffected by factor Xa or thrombin cleavage, suggesting that the loss of anticoagulant activity resulting from cleavage is not primarily due to the loss of membrane binding ability.

Protein S is a vitamin K-dependent, 635-amino acid, nonenzymatic glycoprotein (M r ≅ 78,000; Ref.1Lu D. Xie R.-L. Rydzewski A. Long G.L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) that acts as an anticoagulant in blood (2DiScipio R.G. Davie E.W.

Canfield W.M. Ericsson L.H. Davie E.W. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5824-5831Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The domain organization of protein S is similar to other plasma vitamin K-dependent proteins in that it contains an amino-terminal γ-carboxyglutamate-rich domain and several (four) epidermal growth factor-like domains (5Lundwall A. Dackowski W. Cohen E. Shaffer M. Mahr A. Dahlback B. Stenflo J. Wydro R. Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 6716-6720Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 6Hoskins J. Norman D.K. Beckmann R.J. Long G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 349-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Unique to protein S, however, is a 29-amino acid thrombin-sensitive domain, located between the γ-carboxyglutamate and first epidermal growth factor-like domains. The thrombin-sensitive domain corresponds to exon IV of the protein S gene (7Schmidel D.K. Tatro A.V. Phelps L.G. Tomczak J.A. Long G.L. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 7845-7852Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Protein S also contains a sex steroid binding protein-like domain (8Gershagen S. Lundwall A. Fernlund P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 945-958Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar) at the carboxyl-terminal end of the protein, in place of the serine protease domain found in the vitamin K-dependent plasma proteases. The sex steroid binding protein-like domain has been identified as being composed of two tandem repeat units homologous to the Cys-poor laminin A globular (G) domain found in a number of extracellular ligand binding basement membrane proteins involved in cellular growth and differentiation (9Joseph D.R. Baker M.E. FASEB J. 1982; 6: 2477-2481Crossref Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Schneider and co-workers have described a cultured cell growth arrest-specific protein (Gas6) from NIH 3T3 mouse cells (10Schneider C. King R.M. Philipson L. Cell. 1988; 54: 787-793Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar) and human IMR90 fibroblasts (11Manfioletti G. Brancolini C. Avanzi G. Schneider C. Mol. Cell.

Biophys. 1987; 252: 322-328Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). It is well established that factor Va inactivation by APC can be prevented by factor Xa in the bovine system and that protein S functions by abrogating this protection (16Solymoss S. Tucker M.M. Tracy P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14884-14890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Initially, Kalafatis and Mann in the bovine system (17Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27246-27257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and, subsequently, Rosing et al. (18Rosing J. Hoekema L. Nicolaes G.A.F. Thomassen M.C.L.G.D. Hemker H.C. Varadi K.

Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 2016-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) in the human system have reported that protein S stimulates APC-mediated factor Va inactivation by selectively promoting the cleavage of factor Va at Arg306. A kinetic study of factor Va inactivation by APC revealed that protein S increases theK cat of inactivation by 2-fold without changing the apparent K m for factor Va (16Solymoss S. Tucker M.M. Tracy P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14884-14890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Shen and Dahlback in a purified component system were the first to observe a synergistic effect of protein S and factor V on APC inactivation of factor VIIIa (20Shen L. Dahlback B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18735-18738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This synergistic effect of protein S has been recently confirmed using human factor VIII (21Varadi K. Rosing J. Tans G. Papinger I. Keil B. Schwarz H.P. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 22Lu D. Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. Long G.L. Blood. 1996; 87: 4708-4717Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Besides APC cofactor activity, protein S has also recently been reported by several groups to exhibit APC-independent anticoagulant activity. The first report of APC-independent protein S anticoagulant activity was that of Mitchell et al. (23Mitchell C.A. Keleman S.M. Salem H.H. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1988; 60: 298-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), in which protein S appeared to act as a competitive inhibitor in prothrombin activation. Heeb et al. (24Heeb M.J. Mesters R.M. Tans G. Rosing J. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2872-2877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have also reported the inhibition of the prothrombinase complex by protein S. They also observed direct, reversible binding of protein S to factor Va, which was competitive with prothrombin binding (24Heeb M.J. Mesters R.M. Tans G. Rosing J. Griffin J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2872-2877Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In a follow-up study, Heeb et al. also observed the direct, phospholipid-independent reversible binding and slow inhibition of factor Xa by protein S (25Heeb M.J. Rosing J. Bakker H.M. Fernandez J.A. Tans G. Griffin J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 2728-2732Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar).Bouma's laboratory (26Hackeng T.M. van't Veer C. Meijers J.C.M. Bouma B.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 269: 21051-21058Google Scholar) has also reported the inhibition by protein S of prothrombinase activity on the surface of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells or unstimulated platelets. They have also observed inhibition by protein S of factor Xa generation by the “tenase” complex (purified factors X, IXa, and VIIIa; Ca2+; and synthetic phospholipid or endothelial cells or platelets) (27Koppelman S.J. Hackeng T.M. Sixma J.J. Bouma B.N. Blood. 1995; 86: 1062-1071Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A correlation between protein S binding to synthetic phospholipid vesicles and inhibition of both the purified component prothrombinase and tenase complexes suggests that the APC-independent anticoagulant effect of protein S is at least in part due to its competition for phospholipid surface sites (28Meijers J.C.M. Reitsma P.H. Bertina R.M. Bouma B.N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar).Despite the lack of a clear understanding of the mechanism by which protein S acts as an anticoagulant and its modest cofactor activity, the importance of in vivo protein S anticoagulant activity has been inferred from the correlation of inherited familial protein S deficiency and predisposition to recurrent venous thrombosis (29Comp P.C. Esmon C.T. N. Engl. J. Med. 1984; 311: 1525-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar, 30Comp P.C. Nixon R.R. Cooper M.R. Esmon C.T. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 2082-2088Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 31Schmidel D.K. Nelson R.M. Broxson Jr., E.H. Comp P.C. Marlar R.A. Long G.L. Blood. 1991; 77: 551-559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The common clinical manifestations of early age, recurrent superficial thrombophlebitis, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism are similar to those associated with familial protein C deficiency, consistent with, but not proving, the believed cofactor role of protein S in the protein C anticoagulation pathway (32Esmon C.T. Science. 1986; 35: 1348-1352Google Scholar). The incidence of heterozygous protein S deficiency in patients with thrombotic disease has been estimated to be between 5% (29Comp P.C. Esmon C.T. N. Engl. J. Med. 1984; 311: 1525-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) and 8% (33Bertina R.M. Haemostatsis. 1985; 15: 241-246PubMed Google Scholar), roughly comparable with those for protein C and antithrombin-III deficiency. In many cases, it is likely that other factors contribute to disease. For example, APC resistance resulting from Arg506 → Gln mutation in factor V greatly increases the risk of thrombosis in protein S-deficient individuals (34Koeleman B.P.C. van Rumpt D. Hamulyak K. Reitsma P.H. Bertina R.M. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1994; 74: 580-583Google Scholar).The procoagulant factor Xa, another member of the vitamin K-dependent family of plasma proteins, plays a crucial role in the amplification phase of the blood clotting cascade by enzymatically converting its target, prothrombin, to its active form, thrombin (for reviews, see Refs. 35Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar, 36Rapaport S.I. West. J. Med. 1993; 158: 153-161PubMed Google Scholar, 37Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Factor Xa also plays a pivotal role in blood clotting as a result of its generation by both the intrinsic (factors IXa and VIIIa) and the extrinsic (factor VIIa and tissue factor) pathways (35Davie E.W. Fujikawa K. Kisiel W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10363-10370Crossref PubMed Scopus (1616) Google Scholar, 36Rapaport S.I. West. J. Med. 1993; 158: 153-161PubMed Google Scholar, 37Mann K.G. Nesheim M.E. Church W.R. Haley P. Krishnaswamy S. Blood. 1990; 76: 1-16Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We report here the specific cleavage and inactivation of human protein S by factor Xa. This cleavage and inactivation of protein S may represent a second important mechanism by which factor Xa exerts its procoagulant effect.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsPlasma-derived HPS (pHPS) was purified as described elsewhere (16Solymoss S. Tucker M.M. Tracy P.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14884-14890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories Inc. (South Bend, IN) and was judged by SDS-PAGE to be 15–20% cleaved. Purified human APC and factor Xa and dansylated Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (DEGR) were generous gifts from Dr. Paul Haley, Hematologic Technologies, Inc. (Essex Junction, VT). Synthetic phospholipid vesicles composed of 75%l-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl phosphatidylcholine and 25%l-palmitoyl 2-oleoyl phosphatidylserine (PCPS) and α-thrombin were prepared as described previously (38Barenholz Y. Gibbs D. Litmann B.J. Goll J. Thompson T. Carlson D. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 2806-2810Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar, 39Lundblad R.L. Kingdon H.S. Mann K.G. Methods Enzymol. 1976; 45: 156-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Human factor V was purified and converted to the active form of the cofactor (Va) as described by Katzmann et al. (40Katzmann J.A. Nesheim M.E. Hibbard L.S. Mann K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 162-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Human recombinant protein S (rHPS) was produced in human kidney 293 cells, purified, and chemically characterized as described elsewhere (1Lu D. Xie R.-L. Rydzewski A. Long G.L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Hirudin was obtained from Genentech (South San Francisco, CA). Tick anticoagulant peptide was a gift from Dr. Sriran Krishnaswamy (Emory University, Atlanta, GA). d-Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethyl ketone andd-Phe-Pro-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (PPACK) were purchased from Calbiochem. Benzamidine was purchased from Aldrich. Human plasma-derived factor VIII (outdated Hemofil M, Baxter Healthcare Corp.) was a gift from Dr. Katherine High, Children's Hospital (Philadelphia, PA).Time-dependent Protein S Cleavage by Factor XaRecombinant HPS (300 nm) was digested with factor Xa (6 nm) in the presence of 20 μm PCPS in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 20 nm hirudin for various times (0–120 min) at 37 °C. The samples were then mixed with 2% SDS, 2% β-mercaptoethanol and heated for 5 min at 90 °C prior to electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel (41Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206016) Google Scholar) and visualized by silver staining. For amino-terminal sequencing, the contents of the gel were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue as previously detailed (17Kalafatis M. Mann K.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 27246-27257Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The transferred protein S heavy chain 2-h digestion product (see Fig. 1) was submitted to conventional Edman degradation and product resolution on an Applied Biosystems 475A sequencer in the laboratory of Dr. Alex Kurosky (University of Texas, Medical Branch of Galveston).To test the effect of factor Va, rHPS was also digested in the context of the “prothrombinase” complex (20 μm PCPS, 6 nm factor Xa, and 20 nm factor Va). The possibility of cleavage caused by any contaminating thrombin was excluded by the presence of 20 nm hirudin.Protein S Functional AssayA modified three-stage assay was developed to measure functional protein S activity, in which the end point is a factor VIII(a)-dependent activated partial thromboplastin time clot time (42Langdell R.D. Wagner R.H. Brinkhous K.M. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1953; 41: 637-647PubMed Google Scholar).Stage 1HPS (300 nm) was incubated with 30 nm factor Xa in the presence of 100 μm PCPS in 20 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmCaCl2 (pH 7.4) (HBS/Ca2+ buffer), for 2 h at 37 °C. Following incubation, DEGR was added to all samples (100 nm final concentration), and they were kept at room temperature for 30 min. The samples were then dialyzed twice in Slide-A-Lyzer cassettes (Pierce) versus HBS-Ca2+buffer at room temperature for 3 h to remove unreacted DEGR and tested in a factor Xa chromogenic assay for remaining active factor Xa and DEGR. Portions of the dialyzed samples were run on reduced SDS-PAGE gels to confirm complete cleavage (see Fig. 3 B). Factor Xa was determined to be completely and irreversibly inhibited by DEGR, and unreacted DEGR was effectively removed by dialysis, (based upon amidolytic assays with synthetic substrate Spectrozyme® factor Xa according to the manufacturer (American Diagnostica Inc., Greenwich, CT) (data not shown).Figure 3Effect of factor Xa or α-thrombin digestion on protein S binding to phospholipid. Absorbance at 490 nm due to enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay substrate conversion is plottedversus the concentration of rHPS present in the initial phospholipid binding assay (see “Experimental Procedures” for detail of the assay). Inset, apparent K d values were determined from the curves with the computer program PRISM. ▪, recombinant protein S undigested and not submitted to Fast Q-Flow Sepharose chromatography to remove PCPS prior to phospholipid binding (control); ▴, undigested rHPS submitted to chromatography after the addition of PCPS; ▾, factor Xa-digested rHPS submitted to chromatography; ▵, thrombin-cleaved rHPS not submitted to chromatography.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Stage 2Human plasma-derived factor VIII (outdated Hemofil M, Baxter Healthcare Corp.) at 30 nm concentration (1 unit ≅ 0.07 pmol) was incubated for various times (0–120 min) at 37 °C in HBS/Ca2+, 50 μm PCPS, in the absence or presence of 5 nm APC, or in 5 nm APC plus 100 nm factor Xa-cleaved HPS or undigested HPS from stage 1.Stage 3Equal volumes (100 μl) of HBS buffer, activated partial thromboplastin time reagent (Organon Teknika Corp., Durham, NC), and factor VIII-deficient human plasma (George King Bio-Medical Inc., Overland Park, KS) were combined and preincubated for 1 min at 37 °C. One-μl volumes (10 fmols of initial factor VIII) of samples from stage 2 were then added, followed immediately by initiation of clot formation at 37 °C by the addition of 100 μl of 25 mm CaCl2.In control experiments, the cleavage and inactivation of protein S by human α-thrombin was also measured. The procedure was the same as that described above except 15 nm α-thrombin, no PCPS or Ca2+, and a 1-h incubation was used in stage 1. The α-thrombin was completely and irreversibly inhibited by incubation with 50 nm PPACK, and dialysis removed all active PPACK, as determined with amidolytic assays employing synthetic substrate Spectrozyme® TH (American Diagnostica Inc.) (data not shown). Stages 2 and 3 were identical to those described above.Protein S Binding to PhospholipidThe effect of digestion by factor Xa on protein S binding to phospholipid was determined with a solid phase microtiter plate procedure described by van Wijnen et al. (43van Wijnen M. Stam J.G. van't Veer C. Meijers J.C.M. Reitsma P.H. Bertina R.M. Bouma B.N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Protein S was first digested with factor Xa in the presence of PCPS vesicles as described for stage 1 of the functional assay, above. EDTA was then added to 10 mm, and the digested protein S was loaded onto a Fast-Q-Flow column (0.2-ml bed volume) and washed with 10 column volumes of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm benzamidine, 10 mm EDTA (to disrupt the calcium-dependent interaction of protein S with phospholipid and to remove the phospholipid by elution. The column was then washed with 10 volumes of the above wash solution lacking EDTA, followed by elution of the purified protein S with 400 μl of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mmCaCl, as described previously (1Lu D. Xie R.-L. Rydzewski A. Long G.L. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1997; 77: 1156-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Digestion of protein S was confirmed by SDS-PAGE of the eluted protein as described above, and protein concentration was determined by the micro-BCA protein assay (Pierce) following the supplier's instructions and using purified, untreated human rHPS as a standard. Protein S was also digested with α-thrombin as described for stage 1 of the functional assay (above), followed by inhibition of thrombin by the addition of 40 mm PPACK, and directly added to the phospholipid-coated wells without column purification.Increasing concentrations of digested protein S and undigested protein S (submitted to identical treatment without the addition of factor Xa or α-thrombin) were used in the solid phase lipid binding assay, as described in detail elsewhere (43van Wijnen M. Stam J.G. van't Veer C. Meijers J.C.M. Reitsma P.H. Bertina R.M. Bouma B.N. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1996; 76: 397-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Briefly, PCPS (2.5 μm, 100 μl) was used to coat microtiter wells overnight at 4 °C in 50 mm NaHCO3, pH 9.6, followed by blocking with 1% bovine serum albumin in 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm CaCl2 for 1 h at room temperature. Different amounts of protein S (in 100 μl) were then added in the above buffer containing 0.3% bovine serum albumin (binding buffer) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature, followed by three 10-min washes with 150 μl of binding buffer. Bound protein S was then released by the addition of 100 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA (elution buffer), and 2-h incubation at room temperature.The eluted protein S was then measured in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Microtiter wells were coated with rabbit anti-human protein S IgG (P4555 Sigma), 100 μl at 5 μg/ml in the above binding buffer overnight at 4 °C, followed by three 10-min washes with binding buffer. Eluted protein S from the phospholipid titer wells (100 μl of elution buffer) was then added to the antibody-coated wells and incubated for 3 h at room temperature, followed by three 10-min washes with binding buffer. Mouse anti-human protein S monoclonal antibody 2a (44Litwiller R.D. Jenny R.J. Katzmann J.A. Miller R.S. Mann K.G. Blood. 1986; 67: 1583-1590Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was then added (100 μl, 2 μg/ml) and incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washing, 100 μl of a 1:4000 dilution of horse anti-mouse IgG monoclonal antibody-peroxidase conjugate (PI-2000, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame CA) was applied and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The plates were then washed six times with binding buffer, followed by the addition of enzyme substrates (100 μl of 50 mm citrate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 0.1 mg of o-phenylenediamine and 0.04 μl of 30% H2O2) and a 5-min incubation at room temperature. The reactions were quenched by the addition of 50 μl of 4 m H2SO4, and the absorbance at 490 nm was measured on a V maxspectrophotometer (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). Absorbance at 490 nm versus initial protein S concentration was plotted, and apparent K d values were calculated with the computer software PRIZM (GraphPad™, San Diego, CA), assuming that protein S has one global binding site for phospholipid.RESULTSFig. 1 A shows the time-dependent cleavage of rHPS by factor Xa. The results indicate that a heavy chain cleavage product is generated, which is indistinguishable from that resulting from α-thrombin cleavage (lane 10). The digestion of protein S, shown in Fig. 1, was performed in the presence of 20 nm hirudin, demonstrating that the cleavage is not due to contaminating α-thrombin in the purified plasma-derived factor Xa. The addition of tick anticoagulant peptide (90 nm) or d-Glu-Gly-Arg-chloromethyl ketone (150 μm), both specific factor Xa inhibitors, completely blocked the digestion of rHPS by factor Xa under identical conditions as that described in Fig. 1 (2-h incubation), indicating that the cleavage is indeed factor Xa-specific (data not shown). Also, no cleavage by factor Xa is observed in the presence of 5 mm EDTA or in the absence of CaCl2 or phospholipid (data not shown), indicating that the cleavage is both phospholipid- and Ca2+- dependent.As shown in Fig. 1 B, we also observed that factor Va nearly abolishes this cleavage under conditions where all the factor Xa is in the prothrombinase complex. These results suggest that factor Va inhibits the cleavage by interacting directly with factor Xa and preventing factor Xa accessibility to protein S.The results of NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing are shown in Table I. Comparison of the observed Edman degradation amino acid products with the published sequence of human protein S reveals that cleavage occurs on the carboxyl-terminal side of Arg60 and is distinct from the two α-thrombin cleavage sites (shown schematically in Fig. 4).Table IRepetitive yields from NH 2 -terminal sequencing of factor Xa-cleaved rHPS productCycle numberIdentified amino acidaThe number in parenthesis indicates pmol of amino acid at the given cycle.1Gln (5.73)2Ser (2.04)3Thr (3.02)4Asn (3.14)5Ala (3.09)6Tyr (3.67)7Pro (2.70)8Asp (2.76)9Leu (2.90)10Arg (1.10)11Ser (2.25)12?bNo predominant amino acid was observed, which is consistent with Cys at this point based on the sequence shown in Fig. 4.13Val (2.15)14Asn (0.50)15Ala (1.34)a The number in parenthesis indicates pmol of amino acid at the given cycle.b No predominant amino acid was observed, which is consistent with Cys at this point based on the sequence shown in Fig. 4.

The effectiveness of interferon-α in treating multiple myeloma, however, has been somewhat variable, and the mechanism(s) accounting for this is not well understood. As a means to examine the basis for the differential effectiveness of this cytokine, we have analyzed IFN-α-mediated modulation of the cell cycle in two human myeloma cell lines. These two cell lines, ANBL-6 and KAS-6/1, display dramatically different outcomes in response to this cytokine. Although IFN-α inhibited the growth of ANBL-6 cells by blocking cell cycle progression from G0/G1 to S phase, IFN-α stimulated cell cycle progression in KAS-6/1 cells. Moreover, the effects of IFN-α on cell cycle progression correlated with the phosphorylation status of the retinoblastoma protein. Of interest, IFN-α increased cyclin D2 expression and cyclin-dependent kinase activity in the KAS-6/1 cells but not in the ANBL-6 cells. To determine whether the differential effects of IFN-α on myeloma cell cycle progression could also result from differences in the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, we examined the effects of IFN-α on the induction of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors with broad regulatory function (p21 and p27) and those with specificity for G1-associated cyclin-cyclin-dependent kinase complexes (p15, p16, p18, and p19). Although we failed to detect an effect of IFN-α on expression levels of p21, p15, p16, or p18, IFN-α treatment of the ANBL-6 cell line resulted in induction of p19 expression, whereas it was without effect on the KAS-6/1 cell line. These results suggest that heterogeneity in IFN-α-mediated growth effects in myeloma cells correlates with differential induction of cyclin D2 and p19INK4d expression.

Although IFN-α typically has an anti-proliferative effect on a wide variety of cell types, thereby providing the rationale for its clinical use, IFN-α treatment of MM patients has not been universally effective. Indeed, several reports have demonstrated that IFN-α therapy may actually result in disease aggravation and stimulation of plasma cell growth (4Blade J. Lopez-Guillermo A. Tassies D. Montserrat E. Rozman C. Br. J. Haematol. 1991; 79: 523-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 5Sawamura M. Murayama K. Ui G. Matsushima T. Tamura J. Murakami H. Naruse T. Tsuchiya J. Br. J. Haematol. 1992; 82: 631Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Understanding the mechanisms by which some myeloma cells are adverse to the cell cycle inhibitory effects of IFN-α is essential to permit the effective use of IFN-α in the treatment of MM. Cell cycle progression is regulated by proteins called cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) that associate with each other in a cell cycle phase-specific manner (reviewed in Ref. 6Sherr C.J. Cell. 1993; 73: 1059-1065Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1993) Google Scholar). The process of cyclin-dependent activation of CDKs is counterbalanced by CDK inhibitors (CKIs). The first family of CKIs, referred as the p21cip1 family, includes at least three proteins, and each member of this family binds to several cyclin-CDK complexes (7Xiong Y. Hannon G.J. Zhang H. Casso D. Kobayashi R. Beach D. Nature. 1993; 366: 701-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (3179) Google Scholar). The second family of CKIs, referred to as the INK4 family, specifically binds to CDK4 and CDK6 and hence is specific for regulation of the G1 phase (8Hirai H. Roussel M.F. Kato J.-Y. Ashmun R.A.

The CDK inhibitors function by inhibiting CDK-mediated phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (pRb), a known tumor suppressor (17Kato J.H. Hiebert S.W. Ewen M.E. Sherr C.J.

Thus, during G1 phase, phosphorylation of pRb is regulated by the periodic expression of INK4 CKIs and cyclin Ds, which determines whether active cyclin D-CDK or inactive inhibitor-CDK complexes will be assembled. Growth arrest of hematopoietic cell lines by IFN-α has been shown to correlate with inhibition of pRb phosphorylation (19Kumar R. Atlas I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6599-6603Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar,20Resnitzsky D. Tiefenbrun N. Berissi H. Kimchi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Considerable effort has been directed at the analysis of IFN-α signaling; however, the role of CKIs in mediating inhibition of pRb hyperphosphorylation and cell cycle progression by IFN-α remains to be elucidated. Although p27kip1 has been shown to be induced following IFN-α treatment in some cell lines, its kinetics of expression are not consistent with a role for this inhibitor in the regulation of early G1 phase arrest (21Yamada H. Ochi K. Nakada S. Takahara S. Nemato T. Sekikawa T. Horiguchi-Yamada J. J. Mol. Biochem. 1995; 152: 149-158Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Induction of p21Cip1 expression has also been suggested to underlie IFN-α-mediated growth arrest of Daudi cells, and this occurred in a pRb-dependent manner (22Sangfelt O. Erickson S. Einhorn S. Grander D. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 23Subramaniam P.S. Johnson H.W. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 1997; 17: 11-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). However, p21 expression was also induced in IFN-α growth-arrested pRb−/− U-266 cells and in IFN-α-resistant H9 cells (22Sangfelt O. Erickson S. Einhorn S. Grander D. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In contrast, Yamada et al.(21Yamada H. Ochi K. Nakada S. Takahara S. Nemato T. Sekikawa T. Horiguchi-Yamada J. J. Mol. Biochem. 1995; 152: 149-158Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar) did not observe p21 induction in Daudi cells by IFN-α treatment. Thus, it remains unclear whether the anti-proliferative effects of IFN-α are indeed mediated by p21 or whether IFN-α acts instead via induction of other cell cycle regulatory protein(s). In addition, the role of the INK4 family members has not been clearly defined in IFN-α-mediated cell cycle regulation. Although IFN-α treatment of the U-266 cell line was reported to increase p15 and p16 mRNA expression, these genes were not induced in IFN-α growth-arrested Daudi cells (22Sangfelt O. Erickson S. Einhorn S. Grander D. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). As the U-266 cell line is pRb−/−, the role of these CKIs in mediating the anti-proliferative effects of IFN-α is not understood. Finally, in the same study, IFN-α had no effect on the other two members of the INK4 family, p18 and p19 (22Sangfelt O. Erickson S. Einhorn S. Grander D. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 415-423Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). We have previously described the establishment of a panel of interleukin-6 (IL-6) responsive human myeloma cell lines and have shown that one of the cell lines, KAS-6/1, is uniquely growth stimulated by IFN-α (24Jelinek D.F. Aagaard-Tillery K.M. Arendt B.K. Arora T. Tschumper R.C. Westendorf J.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We have also shown that the differential growth responsiveness of MM cell lines to IFN-α does not seem to result from differential activation of STAT factors (24Jelinek D.F. Aagaard-Tillery K.M. Arendt B.K. Arora T. Tschumper R.C. Westendorf J.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To gain more insight into the differential growth regulation of myeloma cells by IFN-α, in this study we have focused on the analysis of the molecular events regulating cell cycle progression. The myeloma cell lines ANBL-6 and KAS-6/1 were derived in our laboratory and are maintained with IL-6 (kindly provided by Immunex Corp., Seattle, WA) as described previously (25Jelinek D.F. Ahmann G.J. Greipp P.R. Jalal S.M. Westendorf J.J. Katzmann J.A. Kyle R.A. Lust J.A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 5320-5327PubMed Google Scholar, 26Westendorf J.J. Ahmann G.J. Greipp P.R. Witzig T.E. Kyle R.A. Lust J.A. Jelinek D.F. Leukemia. 1996; 10: 866-876PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant purified IFN-α2b was purchased from Schering Corp. and was used at a concentration of 1000 units/ml. Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to pRb and CDK4 as well as polyclonal Abs to cyclin D were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. Rabbit polyclonal antisera against the carboxyl-terminal region of human p33CDK2 was a generous gift of Dr. R. T. Abraham (Mayo Clinic, MN). GST-Rb fusion protein, mouse mAb to p21, and rabbit polyclonal Abs to p15, p16, p18, and p19 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Before analyzing the effects of IFN-α on cell cycle progression, cells were starved of IL-6 for 48 h in medium supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then washed, recultured in media supplemented with bovine serum albumin at a density of 1 × 106 per ml, and stimulated with 1 ng/ml IL-6 or 500 units/ml IFN-α. Cell cycle analysis was subsequently performed using propidium iodide staining as described previously (27Jelinek D.F. Witzig T.E. Arendt B.K. J. Immunol. 1997; 159: 487-496PubMed Google Scholar). As described above, myeloma cells were cultured in IL-6 free media for 48 h prior to addition of the indicated cytokines. Cells (0.5–1.0 × 107) were then lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaF, 10% glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 200 mm NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 1 mm DTT, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin for 30 min on ice. For direct immunoblot analysis, cell lysates containing 50 μg of total protein were resolved by electrophoresis through 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and then transferred onto Immobilon-P membranes (Millipore Corp. For immunoprecipitation, cell lysates were first precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) and then immunoprecipitated with the indicated Abs at 4 °C for 2 h. The immune complexes were collected by adsorption to protein A-Sepharose beads by overnight agitation at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with cold phosphate-buffered saline. The complexes were then boiled in 30 μl of 2 × SDS sample buffer and resolved on an SDS-PAGE gel followed by transfer to Immobilon-P membranes. The membranes were blocked (25 mm Tris-Cl (pH 7.2), 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 2% bovine serum albumin) and subsequently probed with the indicated Abs. For reprobing the same blot, the membranes were stripped with 7 m guanidine, renatured, and blocked before immunoblotting with the indicated Abs. Immunoreactive proteins were detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (Amersham). Cells were lysed on ice in H1 kinase lysis buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm NaF, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm DTT, and protease inhibitors) and then immunoprecipitated with CDK2 antisera and protein A-Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer followed by two washes with kinase buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.0, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm DTT, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Kinase activity of the immunoprecipitated complex was assessed using histone H1 as a substrate in a reaction buffer consisting of 0.6 mg/ml histone H1 (Sigma) and 5 μCi [γ-32P]ATP/reaction and 5 μm cold ATP. Following a 10-min incubation at 30 °C, the reaction was stopped by addition of ice-cold 20 mmEDTA, pH 8.0. Duplicate aliquots of each sample supernatant were spotted onto phosphocellulose paper. The papers were immersed briefly in 1% H3PO4 solution containing 10 mm Na4P2O7. After three additional 15-min washes in 1% H3PO4, radioactivity incorporated in filter-bound histone was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Cells were lysed on ice in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.1% Tween 20, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mmsodium orthovanadate) and immunoprecipitated with CDK4 Abs (UBI) and protein A-Sepharose for 2 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and twice with kinase buffer (50 mmHEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm NaF, 2.5 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mmMgCl2). The kinase reaction was carried out for 30 min at 30 °C in a reaction buffer containing 1 μg/ml GST-pRb, 10 μCi [γ-32P]ATP/reaction, and 20 μm cold ATP. SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added, and proteins were eluted by boiling and resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. The phosphorylated substrate was detected by autoradiograph followed by immunoblotting for CDK4. Total RNA was isolated using the TRIZOL reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) and reverse transcribed using a first strand cDNA synthesis kit (Pharmacia). PCR reactions contained 1.5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm dNTPs, 1 μm each of sense (S) and antisense (AS) oligonucleotides, and 2.5 unitsTaq DNA polymerase (Promega). The primer sequences and their expected sizes are as follows: β-actin, S-5′-gacttcgagcaagagatggccac-3′ and AS-5′-caatgccagggtatggtggtg-3′ (265 bp); p19, S-5′-ctcacacccttggagctgg-3′ and AS-gcagcctgaggcgcagaag-3′ (354 bp); p18, S-5′-ctgcaggttatgaaacttgg-3′ and AS-5′-ttattgaagatttgtggctcc-3′ (382 bp) (28Miller C.W. Aslo A. Campbell M.J. Kawamata N. Lampkin B.C. Koeffler H.P. Cancer Genet. Cytogenet. 1996; 86: 136-142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar); p15, S-5′-ctgcgcgtctgggggctgc-3′ and AS-5′-cctcccgaaacggttgactc-3′ (165 bp) (28Miller C.W. Aslo A. Campbell M.J. Kawamata N. Lampkin B.C. Koeffler H.P. Cancer Genet.

PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels and staining with ethidium bromide after 30 cycles (denaturation at 95 °C for 1 min, annealing at 60 °C for 2 min, and extension at 72 °C for 3 min). In experiments requiring visualization of bands, computer-generated images were obtained by scanning the original autoradiograms or digitalized images of ethidium bromide stained bands. In all cases, the images are representative of the original data. The experiments undertaken in this study were designed to analyze IFN-α-regulated cell cycle control in myeloma cells. The first experiments in this study therefore analyzed the effects of IFN-α-stimulated cell cycle progression following serum and cytokine starvation. As expected, IL-6 stimulated cell cycle progression by both cell lines after 24 and 48 h as revealed by the increased numbers of cells with a DNA content suggestive of cells in S + G2/M phases of the cell cycle (Fig. 1,A and B; Table I). Addition of IFN-α to the ANBL-6 cells failed to stimulate cell cycle progression at any of the time points beyond that observed in control cultures. In striking contrast, KAS-6/1 cells progressed into both the S and the G2/M phases of the cell cycle in response to IFN-α with increasing lengths of stimulation (Fig. 1 B). Moreover, IFN-α did not inhibit IL-6-stimulated KAS-6/1 cell entry into either S or G2/M phases. These data suggest that IFN-α-mediated growth control of myeloma cells is coupled to regulation of cell cycle progression.Table IIFN-α has contrasting effects on myeloma cell cycle progressionCell lineIncubation length (h)Cell cycle phaseStimulusNilIL-6IFN-αIL-6+IFN-α% of cellsANBL-624G0/ G179.160.780.283.5S11.734.58.39.8G2 /M9.14.711.46.648G0 /G180.868.587.885.9S12.410.77.96.4G2 /M6.820.64.17.5KAS-6/124G0/G181.644.045.447.1S8.955.153.652.0G2 /M9.50.91.00.848G0 /G183.540.050.045.9S6.630.914.026.6G2 /M9.829.035.327.3 Open table in a new tab We next examined the possibility that the differential effects of IFN-α on the growth of these cell lines resulted from differential phosphorylation of pRb. As shown in Fig.2 A, IL-6 induced the hyperphosphorylation of pRb in both cell lines as revealed by the reduced rate of pRb electrophoretic migration. When the effects of IFN-α on the ANBL-6 cell line were examined, it was first noted that a 12-h stimulation with IFN-α failed to inactivate pRb by hyperphosphorylation in this cell line and second that IFN-α profoundly inhibited IL-6-stimulated hyperphosphorylation of pRb. By contrast, the hyperphosphorylated form of pRb predominated in IFN-α-stimulated KAS-6/1 cells. The level of pRb hyperphosphorylation stimulated by the combined addition of IL-6 and IFN-α was comparable with that observed in cells stimulated with IL-6 alone (results not shown). It is likely that alterations in the expression of cyclin D or CDK2 and CDK4 might contribute to either the induction or inhibition of pRb phosphorylation by IFN-α. To test this possibility, we next analyzed expression of cyclin D and CDKs in cells cultured with IL-6 or IFN-α for 6 h. As may be seen in Fig. 2 B, IL-6 stimulated the increased expression of cyclin D in both cell lines. Densitometric scanning of multiple experiments revealed that IL-6 increased cyclin D expression by 6.0 ± 0.8-fold in the ANBL-6 cells (n = 2) and by 9.4 ± 0.5-fold in the KAS-6/1 cells (n = 3). By contrast, IFN-α treatment of the ANBL-6 cell line resulted in markedly reduced levels of cyclin D expression (0.2 ± 0.1 relative to control cell levels,n = 2). Furthermore, the IL-6-induced increase in cyclin D expression was antagonized by coculturing ANBL-6 cells with IFN-α (0.6 ± 0.1 relative to control cell levels,n = 2). IFN-α stimulation of the KAS-6/1 cells, however, resulted in an increase in cyclin D expression (6.7 ± 1.3-fold induction over unstimulated cells, n = 3). When the blot was reprobed for the expression of CDK4, no apparent modulation in expression was observed in control or IFN-α-stimulated cells (Fig. 2 C). Similar results were obtained when CDK2 levels were quantitated (results not shown). To characterize the induction of cyclin D expression in greater detail, we next used a polyclonal antisera to immunoprecipitate cyclin D from the KAS-6/1 cells following cytokine stimulation (Fig.3). To determine the identity of the immunoprecipitated cyclin D, we compared its electrophoretic migration with cyclin D immunoprecipitates prepared from control cell lines known to express cyclin D1, D2, and D3 (U2OS) or cyclin D1 and D3 (MCF-7). As may be seen in Fig. 3, both IL-6 and IFN-α were observed to rapidly (6 h) induce cyclin D expression in the KAS-6/1 cell line, and the migration position suggests that these cells primarily express cyclin D2. When cyclin D2 levels were quantitated after 12 h of cytokine stimulation by densitometry, IL-6 caused a 5.1 ± 0.1-fold induction, whereas IFN-α caused a 4.8 ± 0.1-fold induction of cyclin D2 expression (n = 2). When KAS-6/1 cells were stimulated with both cytokines, a 7.9 ± 1.1-fold induction was observed. The ANBL-6 cells were similarly observed to express cyclin D2 upon IL-6 but not IFN-α stimulation (data not shown). pRb phosphorylation during early and late G1 phase is coordinated by the activation of CDK4 and CDK2, respectively (17Kato J.H. Hiebert S.W. Ewen M.E. Sherr C.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 331-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (1093) Google Scholar). To confirm the role of CDK4 and CDK2 in the time course of pRb phosphorylation, we next assayed kinase activity in CDK4 and CDK2 immunoprecipitates from ANBL-6 and KAS-6/1 cell lysates (Fig.4). At 8 h poststimulation, IL-6 stimulated CDK4 activity in ANBL-6 cells as indicated by a 4.4 ± 0.1-fold (n = 2) increase in phosphorylation of a GST-Rb fusion protein. Although IFN-α treatment of the ANBL-6 cells did not alter CDK4 activity over that observed in unstimulated cells (0.7 ± 0.2 relative to control cell levels, n = 2), it suppressed IL-6-induced CDK4 activation to the level of activity observed in unstimulated cells. In contrast, CDK4 kinase activity was increased 4.1 ± 0.2-fold over control cells (n = 2) in response to IFN-α as well as IL-6 (7.0 ± 1.6-fold increase over control cells, n = 2) in KAS-6/1 cells. When CDK2 activity was assayed in the ANBL-6 cells (Fig.5), a 24-h IL-6 stimulation increased CDK2 activity by 8–9-fold over that of unstimulated cells. Although IFN-α itself did not affect basal CDK2 activity, it inhibited the IL-6-mediated increase in CDK2 activity. In contrast, both IL-6 and IFN-α induced a significant increase in CDK2 activity in the KAS-6/1 cell line when assayed after 24 h. Unlike the rapid alterations in the expression of cyclin D, modulations in CDK2 activity were observed only after the effects on cell cycle progression and pRb phosphorylation became obvious.Figure 5Analysis of CDK2 kinase activity by histone H1 kinase assay in ANBL-6 and KAS-6/1 cells. II-6 (solid bars), IFN-α- (open bars), and IL-6 + IFN-α (stippled bars)-stimulated cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-CDK2 Abs. Immunoprecipitates were assayed for H1 kinase, and the data are displayed as the -fold increase in H1 phosphorylation over that observed in unstimulated cells. Results are representative of multiple experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Because IFN-γ has been shown to induce p21 expression (29Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Su W.-C.S. Yu Z.-H. Iwamoto Y. Fu X.-Y. Science. 1996; 272: 719-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), we next asked whether IFN-α stimulation could also affect p21 expression in myeloma cells. As shown in Fig. 6, neither IL-6 nor IFN-α significantly affected p21 expression levels in either the ANBL-6 cells or KAS-6/1 cells. Similarly, p27kip1 expression was not modulated by IL-6 or IFN-α in either cell line (data not shown). Thus, expression levels of p21Cip1 or p27kip1 do not correlate with pRb phosphorylation status. Because IFN-α treatment of myeloma cell lines affected CDK4 activity in direct correlation with pRb phosphorylation status, we next evaluated the ability of IFN-α to induce expression of p15, p16, p18, and p19 mRNA. As shown in Fig. 7, neither IL-6 nor IFN-α altered p15, p16, or p18 mRNA levels in either cell line as assessed by reverse transcriptase-PCR. Densitometric scanning of three independent experiments carried out on three independent preparations of RNA confirmed the lack of effect of these cytokines on p15, p16, and p18 expression. Indeed, the levels of expression in both cell lines were found to be 1.0 ± 0.1 relative to control levels, regardless of the length of stimulation or whether the cells were stimulated with IL-6 or IFN-α. By contrast, IFN-α treatment of ANBL-6 cells resulted in a significant induction of p19 mRNA over the basal levels as early as 2 h poststimulation. These levels remained high with continued IFN-α stimulation. Densitometric scanning of multiple experiments revealed that IFN-α caused -fold increases in p19 expression in the ANBL-6 cells of 7.2 ± 0.4, 8.2 ± 1.4, 9.5 ± 1.7, and 9.2 ± 1.9 following stimulation for 2, 4, 6, and 12 h, respectively (n = three independent preparations of RNA). IFN-α treatment of the KAS-6/1 cell line, however, did not affect basal mRNA expression of p19 in KAS-6/1 cells over the entire time period of 12 h (-fold increases of 1.0 ± 0.3, 0.8 ± 0.1, 1.0 ± 0.1, and 0.8 ± 0.1 after 2, 4, 6, and 12 h, respectively; n = 2). IFN-α stimulation also increased p19 protein expression in ANBL-6 cells, whereas IL-6 stimulation had no effect on p19 expression (Fig.8). Thus, analysis of multiple experiments indicated the ability of IFN-α to increase p19 protein levels by 4.4 ± 0.5, 6.8 ± 1.6, and 8.5 ± 1.7-fold after stimulation for 2, 4, and 6 h, respectively. Similarly, as observed for p19 mRNA, IL-6 or IFN-α did not affect p19 protein expression in KAS-6/1 cells. Rather, IFN-α slightly decreased p19 levels (0.7 ± 0.1 relative to control cell levels after 4 h,n = 3). In contrast with the effects of IFN-α on p19 protein expression, p15 levels were not altered by either cytokine in either cell line (Fig. 8). In similar studies, p18 protein levels were similarly unaffected, whereas p16 protein expression could not be detected (data not shown).Figure 8Protein expression of p15 and p19 following IFN-α treatment in ANBL-6 and KAS-6/1. Cytokine-stimulated cells were lysed, resolved by 15% SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with anti-p15 or anti-p19 Abs. Results are representative of three experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The mechanisms that underlie the variable response of patient myeloma cells to IFN-α treatment have remained elusive primarily as a result of a lack of a suitable model system that is representative ofin vivo heterogeneity. Our panel of myeloma cell lines, however, circumvents this difficulty and provides a physiologically relevant model system in which to study the inherent heterogeneity in IFN-α responsiveness. Moreover, the KAS-6/1 cell line, which uniquely proliferates in response to IFN-α, provides us with a tool to understand “nonclassical” IFN-α responses in a human cell line. Our previous results showed that despite the contrasting effects of IFN-α on the growth of the myeloma cell lines ANBL-6 and KAS-6/1, no differential activation of STAT factors was observed nor was any autocrine IL-6 expression induced in the cells that were growth stimulated by IFN-α (24Jelinek D.F. Aagaard-Tillery K.M. Arendt B.K. Arora T. Tschumper R.C. Westendorf J.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). These results prompted us to examine other mechanisms that may account for the differential biological responsiveness to IFN-α. The studies described herein demonstrate that one of the key mechanisms underlying this heterogeneity may involve regulation of genes that encode for cell cycle regulatory molecules. Our results show that IFN-α stimulates the differential induction of cyclin D2 and p19 INK4d. Our analysis of cell cycle regulatory molecules was prompted by a series of observations. We have demonstrated that IFN-α-stimulated proliferation was accompanied by hyperphosphorylation of pRb and that this did not occur in the growth-inhibited cell line, ANBL-6. Moreover, IFN-α was capable of antagonizing IL-6-stimulated pRb phosphorylation in the same cell line. The finding that IFN-α inhibits IL-6-stimulated pRb phosphorylation in the ANBL-6 cells and directly stimulates pRb hyperphosphorylation in the KAS-6/1 cells is interesting, as these events precede the appearance of alterations in cell cycle progression and thymidine incorporation. This suggested that modulation of the phosphorylation status of pRb may be a key event in determining whether IFN-α stimulates growth or is growth inhibitory. Our results are consistent with other reports in which sensitivity to growth inhibition by IFN-α correlated with suppression of pRb hyperphosphorylation (19Kumar R. Atlas I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 6599-6603Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 20Resnitzsky D. Tiefenbrun N. Berissi H. Kimchi A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 402-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). However, the KAS-6/1 cells differ from cells resistant to the inhibitory effects of IFN-α in that these cells are growth responsive to IFN-α. IFN-α stimulates pRb inactivation, which may allow KAS-6/1 cells to pass this critical G1 to S phase checkpoint. One striking observation in our study was the ability of IFN-α to up-regulate cyclin D2 protein expression in the growth-responsive KAS-6/1 cells but not in the growth-inhibited ANBL-6 cells. In results not shown, we have also demonstrated that IFN-α up-regulated cyclin D2 mRNA in the KAS-6/1 cells but not in the ANBL-6 cells. The cyclin D2 promoter contains potential binding sites for transcription factors of the AP1 family, CTF/NFY, MyB, and C/EBP (30Brooks A.R. Shiffman D. Chan C.S. Brooks E.E. Milner P.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9090-9099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that IFN-α activates one or more of these transcription factors in the KAS-6/1 cells via a mitogenic signaling pathway. We are currently investigating this possibility. We have also shown that IFN-α stimulates an increase in CDK4 and CDK2 activity, which correlated with G1 to S phase progression of the KAS-6/1 cells. Because the activation of CDKs requires association with cyclins, cyclin D2 may therefore play an important role in the regulation of G1 progression by activating CDK4. Another means of cell cycle regulation is provided by the Cip1/Kip1 and INK4 family CKIs. p21Cip1 has been shown to be involved in IFN-γ-mediated growth arrest via STAT1-dependent transcription of p21 waf1/cip1 (29Chin Y.E. Kitagawa M. Su W.-C.S. Yu Z.-H. Iwamoto Y. Fu X.-Y. Science. 1996; 272: 719-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). This suggested the possibility that the differential effects of IFN-α on myeloma cell proliferation may result from differential regulation of p21. However, we did not observe any difference in the expression of p21 with IFN-α stimulation. As we have previously observed STAT1 activation in both cell lines following IFN-α stimulation (24Jelinek D.F. Aagaard-Tillery K.M. Arendt B.K. Arora T. Tschumper R.C. Westendorf J.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 99: 447-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), our observations are consistent with the notion that p21 transcription following STAT activation may not differ between the ANBL-6 and KAS-6/1 cell lines. Our results also do not support a role for p27kip1 in initiating growth arrest in response to IFN. Our analysis of INK4 family expression levels did not show any alterations in p15, p16, and p18 mRNA and protein expression in myeloma cells in response to IFN-α. Although p18 has been shown to be a potential CKI in terminal differentiation of myoblasts (31Franklin D.S. Xiong Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 7: 1587-1599Crossref Scopus (105) Google Scholar) or EBV-transformed B cells (32Morse L. Chen D. Franklin D.S. Xiong Y. Chen-Kiang S. Immunity. 1997; 6: 47-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), it does not seem to function as a primary CKI in the growth arrest of undifferentiated cycling cells. Our data support these observations as myeloma cells differ from normal plasma cells because their terminal differentiation is deregulated. Of interest, p19 expression was induced at both RNA and protein levels by IFN-α in the ANBL-6 cells by as early as 2 h poststimulation, whereas in the IFN-α growth-responsive KAS-6/1 cells, p19 levels remained unaltered following stimulation by IFN-α. These data suggest that IFN-α may regulate growth of myeloma cell lines by inducing transcription of p19 as an early response gene prior to the G1 arrest. As IFN-α also induced p19 expression in the presence of IL-6 in the ANBL-6 cells (data not shown), it suggests that one of the mechanisms by which IFN-α may inhibit IL-6-dependent proliferation is by inducing p19 expression. Recent work by Chan et al. (33Chan F.K.M. Zhang J. Chen L. Shapiro D.N. Winoto A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 2682-2688Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar) demonstrated the ability of p19 to interact with the Nur77 orphan steroid receptor using a yeast two-hybrid system. Although an in vivo interaction between Nur77 and p19 has not been formally demonstrated, these data raise the possibility that p19 might directly bind to targets other than cyclin D-dependent kinases. It is conceivable, therefore, that the basis for p19 specificity resides within its ability to simultaneously contact secondary targets such as transcription factors. Thus, p19 induction in response to IFN-α may lead to functional modulation of a transcription factor besides pRb. The mechanisms underlying the induction of p19 expression in the ANBL-6 cells by IFN-α, as well as the mechanisms underlying the failure of IFN-α to induce p19 in the KAS-6/1 cells, are currently under investigation. In summary, we have demonstrated that IFN-α-stimulated myeloma cell proliferation or growth arrest correlates with induction of cyclin D2 or p19, or lack thereof. Because of the important role that both of these proteins play in up- or down-regulation of the cell cycle, these results are highly suggestive that these molecules play a direct role in determining cellular outcome in response to IFN-α. Although these results are very interesting, it is important to acknowledge that our studies have not yet identified the signals that lie upstream of these effects, which presumably lie in close proximity to the IFN-α receptor. In this regard, a serine/threonine kinase PKR has been shown to down-regulate c-Myc expression in growth-arrested cells (34Raveh T. Hovanessian A.G. Meurs E.F. Sonenberg N. Kimchi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 25479-25484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). However, we have not observed alterations in the expression of c-Myc in growth inhibitory or proliferative responses of myeloma cells to IFN-α (35Jelinek D.F. Arora T. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 224: 261-268PubMed Google Scholar). It will be interesting to determine whether PKR or additional signaling pathways may control induction of p19 or cyclin D2. Finally, it remains possible that genetic variations in myeloma cell lines may lead to IFN-α-dependent activation of different transcription factors, which ultimately results in positive or negative regulation of p19 and cyclin D2 and hence in differential growth control.

https://openalex.org/W1967836923,"Human DNase I, an enzyme used to treat cystic fibrosis patients, has been engineered to more effectively degrade double-stranded DNA to lower molecular weight forms by introducing positively charged amino acids at positions that can interact favorably with the proximal negatively charged phosphate groups of the DNA. A series of combination mutants having from one to six additional basic residues compared with the wild type has been constructed, expressed in human 293 cells, and characterized. The degree of hyperactivity for the mutants was highly dependent upon the conditions in various assays, including the concentration and length of the DNA substrate and the salt and divalent metal ion concentrations. The level of hyperactivity was inversely proportional to both DNA concentration and DNA length, consistent with the processive nicking mechanism for the hyperactive variants. Salt was inhibitory for wild type DNase I but actually enhanced the activity of the hyperactive variants. Under optimal conditions for wild type, variants with one additional positive charge possessed the highest activity, which was only severalfold greater than that for wild type. However, in the presence of low DNA concentrations and molecular weights, no Ca2+, and 150 mm NaCl, the variant with six engineered basic residues was most active, having >10,000-fold higher activity than the wild type enzyme. Therefore, any potential increase in potency for the hyperactive variants in vivo will be determined by the concentration, length, and environment of the DNA.

Recombinant human DNase I is an important clinical agent that is currently used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients (1Ramsey B.W. N. Engl. J. Med. 1996; 335: 179-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). It is inhaled into the airways, where it degrades DNA to lower molecular weight fragments, thus reducing the viscoelasticity of cystic fibrosis sputum and improving lung function (2Ramsey B.W. Astley S.J. Aitken M.L. Burke W. Colin A.A. Dorkin H.L. Eisenberg J.D. Gibson R.L. Harwood I.R. Schidlow D.V. Wilmott R.W. Wohl M.E. Meyerson L.J. Shak S. Fuchs H. Smith A.L. Am. Rev. Respir.

In addition, the use of DNase I in a murine model of systemic lupus erythematosus has been investigated with encouraging results (4Macanovic M. Sinicropi D. Shak S. Baughman S. Thiru S. Lachmann P.J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1996; 106: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The pharmacological and clinical significance of DNase I has led us to recently engineer actin-resistant variants of the human enzyme that are no longer inhibited by actin (5Ulmer J.S. Herzka A. Toy K.J. Baker D.L. Dodge A.H. Sinicropi D. Shak S. Lazarus R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8225-8229Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), as well as hyperactive variants that alter the functional mechanism of DNA cleavage (6Pan C.Q. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6624-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar); characterization of these variants under biologically relevant ex vivo conditions has shown a marked improvement in potency compared with wild type. 1C. Q. Pan, T. H. Dodge, D. L. Baker, W. S. Prince, D. V. Sinicropi, and R. A. Lazarus, submitted for publication. Furthermore, we have recently addressed the functional importance of various residues of human DNase I at the DNA binding interface by extensive mutagenesis (7Pan C.Q. Ulmer J.S. Herzka A. Lazarus R.A. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 628-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). DNase I is an endonuclease that catalyzes the hydrolysis of double-stranded DNA predominantly by a single-stranded nicking mechanism under physiological conditions when both Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions are present (8Campbell V.W. Jackson D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 3726-3735Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hyperactive variants utilized a more efficient functional mechanism involving processive nicking, which yielded a greater number of double-stranded breaks as a result of higher affinity for DNA (6Pan C.Q. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6624-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Eight “hyperactive” positions were selected from a mutational scanning analysis of the DNase I-DNA interface, where Arg or Lys replaced the native residues (Fig. 1). The engineered positive charges were designed to generate attractive interactions with the negatively charged phosphates on the DNA backbone. In addition, the tighter binding to DNA also eliminated the significant inhibition of DNase I by physiological saline. The combination of three hyperactive positions led to a +3 variant 2The terms +1 variant, +2 variant, …, +6 variant refer to human DNase I mutants having one, two, …, six additional positively charged residues compared with the wild type. with three additional positive charged residues and ∼35-fold higher DNA cutting activity relative to wild type. In the present study, we have constructed seven new combination mutants that have up to six more positive charges than the wild type. These have been expressed in human 293 cells to determine the degree and limits of hyperactivity under an array of different assay conditions in which the concentration and length of the DNA substrate, the salt concentration, and the type of metal ions were varied. Under selected conditions, the hyperactive variant that has six additional positive charged residues was >10,000-fold more active than the wild type enzyme. All modeling work was performed with the InsightII program (Molecular Simulation, Inc., San Diego). The crystal structure of human DNase I (9Wolf E. Frenz J. Suck D. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 79Google Scholar) was superimposed onto that of the bovine DNase I-octamer complex (10Weston S.A. Lahm A. Suck D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1237-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar); the backbone root mean square deviation was 0.5 Å. The six hyperactive positions that were combined into the +6 variant were replaced with either lysine or arginine (Fig.1 A). The orientation of each introduced basic amino acid side chain was selected from a rotamer library (11Ponder J.W. Richards F.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 193: 775-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1349) Google Scholar) based on three criteria. The chosen rotamer had one of the lowest energies, had no steric clashes with DNA or the rest of the protein, and placed the side chain amino group near the DNA phosphate oxygens. With the exception of residue 9, the nitrogen stemming from each engineered Arg or Lys was between 3 and 4 Å from a phosphate oxygen. The direction of Arg9 modeled in the +6 human variant was similar to those found in the two structures of DNA complexed to bovine DNase I (10Weston S.A. Lahm A. Suck D. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 1237-1256Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar,12Lahm A. Suck D. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 645-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), which has an arginine at position 9. The electrostatic potentials of the wild type human DNase I and its +6 variant (Fig. 1 B) were calculated by using the default setups of the Delphi program (Molecular Simulation, Inc., San Diego, CA). Site-directed mutagenesis, DNase I expression in human 293 cells and secretion into the culture media, human DNase I ELISA, and actin binding ELISA measurements were carried out essentially as described previously (5Ulmer J.S. Herzka A. Toy K.J. Baker D.L. Dodge A.H. Sinicropi D. Shak S. Lazarus R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8225-8229Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar,6Pan C.Q. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6624-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Multiple mutations were introduced into DNase I by including several single mutant primers in one hybridization reaction (13Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). The actin binding affinity of all of the hyperactive variants described herein was the same as wild type, implying that their overall structural integrity remained intact. Those variants with the A114F mutation no longer bound to actin, as predicted based upon previous mutational data at this position (5Ulmer J.S. Herzka A. Toy K.J. Baker D.L. Dodge A.H. Sinicropi D. Shak S. Lazarus R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8225-8229Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). All characterization assays were carried out in 25 mm Hepes, pH 7. Mg2+ and Ca2+ concentrations ranged from 1 to 2.5 mm; no significant differences were observed in this concentration range. Physiological concentrations of 1 mm Mg2+ and 2.5 mm Ca2+ were used in most experiments. The methyl green assay was used to measure DNA hydrolytic activity of DNase I in the presence of 2 mm Mg2+ and 2 mm Ca2+as described previously (14Sinicropi D. Baker D.L. Prince W.S. Shiffer K. Shak S. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Salmon testes DNA (Sigma), up to ∼25,000 bp 3The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); TBE, tris-borate EDTA (90 mm Tris borate and 2 mm EDTA). in size, was mixed with methyl green (Sigma) to create the DNA-methyl green substrate with a final DNA concentration of 770 μg/ml, used for the assay. DNase I concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using a goat anti-DNase I polyclonal antibody coat and detecting with a rabbit anti-DNase I polyclonal antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. In both assays, multiple sample dilutions were compared with standard curves of wild type DNase I to determine concentrations. Kinetic assays were based on the Kunitz hyperchromicity assay (15Kunitz M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1950; 33: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Diluted culture media was incubated with 10–300 μg/ml calf thymus DNA (Sigma) in 25 mmHepes, pH 7, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mmCaCl2, and 150 mm NaCl at room temperature. The subsequent increase in absorbance at 260 nm was monitored with a Molecular Devices Spectra Max 250 spectrophotometer. No activity was detected in mock-transfected media. Plots of initial rates ofA 260 increase versus DNA concentration were hyperbolic for most variants, and the data were fit by nonlinear regression analysis to the Michaelis-Menten equation to generate apparent K m and V maxkinetic values. For the salt inhibition assay (see Fig. 6 A), the DNA concentration was fixed at the saturating concentration of 300 μg/ml, and the amount of NaCl was varied from 0 to 400 mm. Supercoiled pBR322 plasmid DNA (New England Biolabs) at 29 μg/ml or linearized pBR322 (EcoRI-digested and purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation) at 25 μg/ml was treated with diluted culture media from human 293 cells transfected with wild type or variant DNase I in the presence of 25 mm Hepes, pH 7, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2 with varying NaCl concentrations at room temperature. At various time intervals, aliquots of the reaction mix were quenched with 25 mm EDTA, 6% glycerol, xylene cyanol, and bromphenol blue and loaded directly on a 0.8% agarose gel. The gel was run overnight at ∼1 V/cm in TBE and stained with ethidium bromide, and individual bands were quantified with a Molecular Dynamics model 575 FluorImager. The overall activity was measured as the initial rate of disappearance of supercoiled or linear substrate. The linear to relaxed ratio was also determined from the initial rates of appearance of linear and relaxed products. Mock-transfected media showed no background activity. EcoRI-linearized plasmid pBR322 (4361-mer) was radiolabeled at the 3′-end using [α-32P]dATP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) (16Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 10.51-10.55Google Scholar). A fraction of the labeled pBR322 was then digested separately with HindIII (New England Biolabs) and PstI (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), followed by polyacrylamide gel purification of the respective 32-mer and 752-mer restriction fragments. Radiolabeling of the 190-merEcoRI-SspI fragment of pBR322 has been described previously (6Pan C.Q. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6624-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). 32P-Labeled linearized pBR322 at concentrations ranging from 8.6 ng/ml (3 pm) to 29 μg/ml (10 nm), the 190-mer fragment at 85 ng/ml (680 pm), and the 752-mer fragment at 6.3 ng/ml (12.7 pm) were treated with diluted culture media from DNase I-transfected 293 cells at room temperature in the presence of 25 mm Hepes, pH 7, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. For the 4361-mer and 752-mer fragments, the reaction was quenched with 25 mm EDTA, 6% glycerol, 50 mm NaOH, xylene cyanol, and bromphenol blue and loaded onto a 0.8% denaturing agarose gel in 50 mm NaOH. For the 190-mer fragment, the reaction was stopped with 10 mm EDTA, xylene cyanol, and bromphenol blue in deionized formamide and run on a 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The labeled 32-mer fragment at 6.3 ng/ml (300 pm) was treated with DNase I in the presence of 25 mm Hepes, pH 7, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm CaCl2, 150 mm NaCl, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin; in some reactions, CaCl2 was replaced by 0.1 mm EGTA and NaCl was omitted. Reactions were stopped with 10 mmEDTA, xylene cyanol, and bromphenol blue in deionized formamide and run on a 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The gels were dried and incubated with a Fuji phosphorimaging plate (type BAS-III), which was then scanned with a Fuji phosphorimager (BAS2000). The activity was measured as the initial rate of disappearance of linear DNA substrate. Eight hyperactive positions of DNase I were previously identified using a basic residue scan of the DNase I-DNA interface (6Pan C.Q. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6624-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Based upon data from two different combination variants at some of these positions, the degree of hyperactivity reflected the additivity of individual mutations, at least under a given set of conditions. In the present study, we constructed, expressed, and characterized multiple variants having from one to six additional positively charged amino acids at these hyperactive positions (Fig.1 A) to test the effects of progressively increasing the number of positive charges on DNase I activities. These engineered basic residues altered the electrostatic surface at the DNA binding interface such that a positive potential was created at areas that are distal to and distinct from the active site (Fig. 1 B). The degrees of hyperactivity of these variants were assessed in a series of assays under different conditions. In particular, the DNA concentration ranged from ng/ml to mg/ml, and the DNA length varied from 32 to ∼25,000 bp. In addition, the effects of salt and divalent metal ion concentrations were also determined for these variants. Hyperactive variants were first tested in the DNA-methyl green assay, which measures a decrease ofA 620 as the methyl green dye is released from hydrolyzed DNA. This assay was used to determine the hydrolytic activities of hyperactive DNase I variants in the presence of 770 μg/ml DNA that is up to ∼25,000 bp in length, Mg2+, Ca2+, and no NaCl (14Sinicropi D. Baker D.L. Prince W.S. Shiffer K. Shak S. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 222: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Single basic residue replacements showed relatively modest increases in activity relative to wild type (Table I). The addition of more positive charges progressively reduced the degree of hyperactivity to the extent that variants with five or six more charges were actually less active than wild type.Table IRelative DNA digestion activity of human DNase I variantsVariant1-aThe number of additional positively charged residues relative to wild type DNase I are indicated in parenthesis.DNA hyperchromicity assayLinear DNA activitySupercoiled DNAMethyl green activity1/K mV maxV max/K mL/RActivityWild type1.0 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.11.01.0 ± 0.11.01.0 ± 0.011.00 ± 0.03Wild type1-bThese variants are made in the actin-resistant A114F background.0.9 ± 0.10.90.9 ± 0.11.10 ± 0.23Q9R (+1)0.9 ± 0.22.8 ± 0.42.63.5 ± 0.42.33.4 ± 0.51.69 ± 0.22E13R (+1)4.3 ± 1.41.5 ± 0.16.56.0 ± 0.55.42.2 ± 0.011.45 ± 0.25T14K (+1)2.3 ± 0.91.1 ± 0.22.54.2 ± 0.14.72.9 ± 0.81.27 ± 0.05H44K (+1)2.3 ± 0.51.1 ± 0.12.52.0 ± 0.42.31.8 ± 0.30.96 ± 0.16N74K (+1)1.3 ± 0.43.6 ± 0.54.76.0 ± 0.14.77.3 ± 1.02.67 ± 0.23T205K (+1)2.4 ± 0.82.1 ± 0.45.04.7 ± 0.25.42.8 ± 0.71.22 ± 0.16E13R/N74K (+2)5.0 ± 1.75.3 ± 0.526.526.7 ± 4.112.36.9 ± 1.61.33 ± 0.12Q9R/E13R/N74K (+3)4.9 ± 1.37.0 ± 0.434.338.3 ± 1.216.56.3 ± 2.21.36 ± 0.23Q9R/E13R/N74K1-bThese variants are made in the actin-resistant A114F background.

Open table in a new tab Variants were then tested in the DNA hyperchromicity assay in which the A 260, due to the DNA absorption, increases as a function of degradation (15Kunitz M. J. Gen. Physiol. 1950; 33: 349-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Plots of initial velocity versus substrate concentration (10–300 μg/ml and up to ∼25,000 bp) yielded hyperbolic curves for wild type DNase I and most variants (Fig. 2), allowing the extraction of apparent K m andV max values using the Michaelis-Menten equation (Table I). Like the single variants, variants with multiple mutations displayed hyperactivities that can be ascribed to both a decrease inK m , suggesting stronger DNA affinity, and an increase in V max. A maximum of 7–8-fold higherV max than wild type was generally observed for variants having three or four additional positive charges (Table I). Further increases in the number of positive charges (+5 and +6 mutants) continued to lower the K m but also lowered theV max, suggesting that the decrease in turnover number may be a result of binding to the DNA too tightly. Overall, in the presence of Mg2+, Ca2+, 150 mmNaCl, and relatively high DNA concentrations and molecular weights, a maximal improvement in theV max/K m of 30–40-fold was found for variants containing three or four additional positive charges relative to wild type. The degradation of supercoiled plasmid pBR322 to relaxed circle or linearized product permits an assessment of the degree of “nicking” versus“cutting” for different DNase I variants. The lowerK m values observed for the hyperactive variants suggest that they bind to DNA tighter and thus may stay on the DNA longer, potentially allowing some double-stranded DNA scission instead of nicking one of the strands as observed for wild type. The introduction of a single positive charge in human DNase I created hyperactive variants that yielded a linear to relaxed product ratio that was 2–5-fold greater than wild type, and the subsequent progressive introduction of additional positively charged residues resulted in an increase in the linear to relaxed product ratio of >200-fold over wild type (Table I). In addition to the number of charges, the specific location of the mutation also affected this ratio, as exemplified by the differences between the two +3 mutants Q9R/E13R/N74K and E13R/N74K/T205K. Furthermore, the +6 variant appeared to yield lower molecular weight products prior to much disappearance of the supercoiled substrate as indicated by the smear running slightly faster than the linear product (Fig. 3), consistent with processive DNA degradation. The maximal overall supercoiled DNA nicking activity of ∼7-fold greater than wild type, as measured by the disappearance of the supercoiled substrate, was attained with just one basic amino acid substitution in the N74K variant (Table I). In general, introducing additional basic residues progressively reduced the overall nicking activity with the +6 mutant possessing an activity that was actually less than wild type. These results again support the notion that stronger DNA affinity and a lower turnover number are accompanied by increasing the number of positive charges at the hyperactive positions on DNase I. The data from the supercoiled plasmid cleavage predict that these positively charged DNase I variants should be more active than wild type in degrading linearized plasmid DNA. Under conditions similar to those of the hyperchromicity assay (Mg2+, Ca2+, 150 mm NaCl, and relatively high DNA concentrations (25 μg/ml) and length (4361 bp)), comparable levels of hyperactivities were observed in the linear DNA digestion assay (Table I). The +3 and +4 variants again possessed the greatest activities, having a 30–40-fold increase relative to wild type. Interestingly, the +6 mutant displayed a linear DNA digestion activity ∼7-fold higher than that of the wild type, even though its overall supercoiled DNA nicking activity was only 60% of the wild type activity. This is consistent with earlier data and again implies that it is not the total number, but rather the type of catalytic events, i.e.double-stranded scission, that imparts hyperactivity (6Pan C.Q. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6624-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Our previous data showed that the +2 variant E13R/N74K was ∼20-fold more active than wild type when nicking 0.5 μg/ml of a 190-bp DNA fragment but ∼2-fold less active when hydrolyzing 30 μg/ml of a DNA fragment with 4361 bp (6Pan C.Q. Lazarus R.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6624-6632Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). To resolve the apparent paradox, we have determined the degree of hyperactivity by varying both the DNA concentration and DNA length. Radiolabeled plasmid pBR322 at concentrations ranging from 3 pm (8.6 ng/ml) to 10 nm (29 μg/ml) was treated with different amounts of wild type and the +2 hyperactive variant E13R/N74K in the presence of Mg2+, the presence of Ca2+, and the absence of NaCl (Fig.4). The mutant had single-stranded nicking activity 19 ± 1 times higher than that of the wild type at low DNA concentrations (10 pm) but 2.5 ± 0.5-fold lower activity at high substrate concentrations (10 nm) (Fig. 4 A). Plots of initial rates versus DNA concentrations were hyperbolic for both the native and mutant DNase I and fit the Michaelis-Menten equation well (Fig. 4 B). Wild type DNase I and E13R/N74K have K m values of 5.7 ± 0.8 nm (16 ± 2 μg/ml) and 0.11 ± 0.2 nm (0.32 ± 0.05 μg/ml) DNA, respectively, andV max values of 183 ± 12 and 51 ± 1 nm DNA·min−1·nm−1DNase I (14200 ± 900 and 4000 ± 100 mg of DNA·min−1·mg−1 DNase I), respectively. The general trend of the positively charged variants displaying greater hyperactivity at lower DNA concentrations holds true for mutants with one to six additional positive charges (data not shown). For example, the +1 mutant N74K was ∼15-fold more active than wild type when digesting 3 pm of pBR322 but only 3-fold more active when the substrate concentration was elevated to 10 nm. Similarly, the +6 variant was ∼3-fold more active but ∼10-fold less active than wild type at 50 pm and 10 nm pBR322 substrate, respectively. To address the DNA size dependence of hyperactivity, we determined the DNase I nicking activities of DNA fragments with four different lengths. At a substrate concentration of 6–8 ng/ml, the degree of hyperactivity for the E13R/N74K variant in the presence of Mg2+ and Ca2+ progressively increased from ∼20-fold over wild type for the 4361-bp plasmid pBR322 to ∼30- and ∼200-fold for its 752- and 32-bp restriction fragments, respectively (TableII). Likewise, at a fixed DNA concentration of 85 ng/ml, the level of hyperactivity for the +2 mutant nearly doubled when the DNA size was reduced from 4361 to 190 bp. The amount of improvement in nicking activity for N74K over the wild type also increased significantly with shorter DNA lengths. Therefore, the degree of hyperactivity by DNase I variants with additional positively charged residues at its DNA binding interface is inversely proportional not only to substrate concentration but also to DNA length.Table IIDependence of relative DNA nicking activity by human DNase I variants on DNA length and concentrationDNase I variantDNA, ng/ml (pm)6.3 (300) 32 bp6.3 (13) 752 bp8.5 (3) 4361 bp85 (680) 190 bp85 (30) 4361 bpWild type1 ± 0.11 ± 0.21 ± 0.11.0 ± 0.061 ± 0.1N74K26 ± 515 ± 210.4 ± 0.9E13R/N74K211 ± 1831 ± 319 ± 324.3 ± 113 ± 1.0E13R/N74K/T205K15 ± 38.7 ± 1E13R/T14K/N74K/T205K7 ± 11.3 ± 0.03Q9R/E13R/T14K/H44R/N74K/T205K7 ± 10.7 ± 0.02 Open table in a new tab To determine the degree of hyperactivity under optimal conditions for the mutants, we examined their relative nicking activities using a short 32-bp fragment of DNA and at a very low concentration of 6.3 ng/ml under different metal ion and salt conditions (TableIII). Under more favorable conditions for wild type, i.e. in the presence of Mg2+, the presence of Ca2+, and the absence of NaCl, the +2 mutant displayed the greatest hyperactivity, being ∼200-fold higher than wild type; the addition of two (+4) or four (+6) more positive charges resulted in a dramatic decrease to only 7-fold more active. The absence of Ca2+ destabilized the wild type more than the mutants, 4C. Q. Pan and R. A. Lazarus, unpublished results. leading to an increased hyperactivity of ∼2000-fold for the +2, +4, and +6 variants. Salt significantly inhibited the wild type enzyme but not the hyperactive mutants (see below). Therefore, in the presence of Mg2+, Ca2+, and 150 mm NaCl, the DNA nicking activity was progressively enhanced with each additional positive charge, cumulating in a ∼6000-fold increased hyperactivity for the +6 mutant (Fig. 5, Table III). Finally, the degree of hyperactivity was greatest in the presence of 150 mm salt and the absence of Ca2+ and resulted in a >10,000-fold increase in activity over wild type for the +6 variant.Table IIIRelative nicking activity of human DNase I variants on a 32-bp DNA fragmentVariantsMg2+, NaClMg2+Mg2+, Ca2+Mg2+, Ca2+, NaClWild type1 ± 0.21 ± 0.01 ± 0.11 ± 0.2N74K8 ± 0.133 ± 926 ± 59 ± 1E13R/N74K191 ± 322292 ± 417211 ± 18331 ± 60E13R/N74K/T205K195 ± 27720 ± 14715 ± 3339 ± 71E13R/T14K/N74K/T205K2364 ± 3311521 ± 1257 ± 11306 ± 281Q9R/E13R/T14K/H44R/N74K/T205K12727 ± 22732079 ± 3957 ± 15885 ± 1116 Open table in a new tab We further addressed the ionic effects on the DNA cleavage activity of the combination hyperactive variants because wild type human DNase I is highly sensitive to salt, and salt concentration plays a significa"
https://openalex.org/W1979043358,"Translation initiation of the repZgene encoding the replication initiator of plasmid ColIb-P9 is not only negatively regulated by the action of the antisense Inc RNA encoded in the leader region, but is also coupled to the translation and termination of a transcribed leader sequence, repY, a positive regulatory element for repZ gene expression. This translational coupling depends on base pairing between two complementary sequences, 5′-rGGCG-3′ and 5′-rCGCC-3′, which are located upstream of and in the middle of repY, respectively, and have the potential to form a pseudoknot with the stem-loop structure I. Another stem-loop called structure III near the 3′-end ofrepY sequesters both the 5′-rCGCC-3′ sequence and therepZ ribosome-binding site. Here we show that the RepZ mRNA leader sequence synthesized in vitro indeed contains several stem-loop structures including structures I and III, but not the pseudoknot. However, disruption of structure III, without changing the repZ ribosome-binding site, by means of base substitution and deletion induces base pairing between the two short complementary sequences distantly separated, resulting in the formation of a pseudoknot. When the pseudoknot is allowed to form in vivo due to the same mutations, a maximum level ofrepZ expression is obtained comparable to one observed in the absence of Inc RNA. These results strengthen our previously proposed model that the pseudoknot induced by the translation and termination of the repY reading frame functions as the molecular switch for translational initiation of the repZgene. Translation initiation of the repZgene encoding the replication initiator of plasmid ColIb-P9 is not only negatively regulated by the action of the antisense Inc RNA encoded in the leader region, but is also coupled to the translation and termination of a transcribed leader sequence, repY, a positive regulatory element for repZ gene expression.

Evidence has been accumulating that RNA pseudoknots, stem-loop structures containing an extended double helix with a complementary sequence outside the loop (for review, see Refs. 1ten Dam E. Pleij K. Draper D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 11665-11676Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar and 2Schimmel P. Cell. 1989; 58: 9-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), play an important role in control of gene expression at the translational level. In the Escherichia coli ribosomal protein α andrpsO operons, RNA pseudoknots act as the binding sites for proteins S4 and S15, respectively, being responsible for autoregulation of the respective operon genes (3Tang C.K.

In some mammalian retroviruses and in the mRNA for the rat ornithine decarboxylase antizyme, RNA pseudoknots function as regulatory signals for +1 or −1 frameshifting or translational read-through to allow translation of sequences downstream of stop codons (5Brieley I.

In IncIα ColIb-P9 and IncB pMU720 plasmids, possible RNA pseudoknots have been proposed to be the molecular switches for translation initiation of the replication initiator genes, thereby controlling plasmid copy number in the host cells (8Asano K. Kato A. Moriwaki H. Hama C. Shiba K. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3774-3781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Asano K. Moriwaki H. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol.

ColIb-P9 is a low-copy number and self-transmissible plasmid with a size of 93 kilobases (kb). 1The abbreviations used are; kb, kilobase(s); bp, base pair(s); RBS, ribosome-binding site; Kmr, kanamycin resistant; RNase, ribonuclease. 1The abbreviations used are; kb, kilobase(s); bp, base pair(s); RBS, ribosome-binding site; Kmr, kanamycin resistant; RNase, ribonuclease.The basic replicon of ColIb-P9 consists of a 3-kb DNA fragment which contains sufficient information required for autonomous replication and copy number control (Ref. 11Hama C. Takizawa T. Moriwaki H. Urasaki Y. Mizobuchi K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1983-1991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, also see Fig.1). The frequency of ColIb-P9 replication is limited by the degree of expression of the repZ gene encoding a 39-kDa replication initiation protein, RepZ, which is thought to react with the replication origin (11Hama C. Takizawa T. Moriwaki H. Urasaki Y. Mizobuchi K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1983-1991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Previous studies revealed that repZ expression was negatively controlled by the antisense Inc RNA of about 70 bases, the product of theinc gene that governs the phenotype of plasmid incompatibility (11Hama C. Takizawa T. Moriwaki H. Urasaki Y. Mizobuchi K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1983-1991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Shiba K. Mizobuchi K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1992-1997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inc RNA is transcribed from the noncoding strand of the leader region of repZ and binds to RepZ mRNA at the complementary region to form an RNA-RNA duplex (12Shiba K. Mizobuchi K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1992-1997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two promoter down mutations, inc1 and inc2, altered the −35 and −10 regions of the inc gene promoter, pinc, and increased the level of repZ expression without affecting significantly the amount of RepZ mRNA (Refs. 11Hama C. Takizawa T. Moriwaki H. Urasaki Y. Mizobuchi K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1983-1991Crossref PubMed Google Scholarand 12Shiba K. Mizobuchi K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1992-1997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar; see Fig. 1 B for positions of inc1 andinc2). Thus, Inc RNA negatively controls repZexpression at the translational level. In an effort to elucidate the molecular events required forrepZ expression, we also isolated replication-defective (rep) mutations (8Asano K. Kato A. Moriwaki H. Hama C. Shiba K. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3774-3781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hama C. Takizawa T. Moriwaki H. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10666-10673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two types of repmutations were isolated that were located in the leader region ofrepZ. One type including rep57 disrupted an upstream open reading frame called repY which encodes a polypeptide of 29 amino acids. rep57 was an amber mutation of repY codon-11 (13Hama C. Takizawa T. Moriwaki H. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10666-10673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and reduced the level ofrepZ expression without affecting the amount of RepZ mRNA (8Asano K. Kato A. Moriwaki H. Hama C. Shiba K. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3774-3781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Hama C. Takizawa T. Moriwaki H. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10666-10673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Changing the amino acid composition of the reading frame by frameshift mutations did not affect repZtranslation, whereas repZ translation was abolished profoundly when the position of the repY stop codon, located 7 bases downstream of the repZ start codon, was shifted either by frameshift mutations or changing the stop codon to a sense codon, indicating that the translational termination event of therepY reading frame, not the RepY polypeptide itself, is required for repZ translation (9Asano K. Moriwaki H. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24549-24556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since the level ofrepY expression was inversely correlated with the amount of endogenous Inc RNA (13Hama C. Takizawa T. Moriwaki H. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10666-10673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and the 5′-end of Inc RNA was located 3 bases upstream of the repY RBS (12Shiba K. Mizobuchi K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1992-1997Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we concluded that inhibition of repY translation by Inc RNA is at least one mechanism by which Inc RNA represses repZ translation (13Hama C. Takizawa T. Moriwaki H. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10666-10673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surprisingly, however, the other type of rep mutations were found to disrupt an intramolecular base pairing within RepZ mRNA between the 5′-rGGCG-3′ and 5′-rCGCC-3′ sequences, distantly separated at positions 327–330 and 437–440, respectively (Ref. 8Asano K. Kato A. Moriwaki H. Hama C. Shiba K. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3774-3781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, see Figs.1 B and 2 C). rep2006 (G327A) andrep2041 (G330A) changed the first and forth guanine residues of the former, whereas rep2044 (G438A) altered the second guanine residue of the latter (8Asano K. Kato A. Moriwaki H. Hama C. Shiba K. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3774-3781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Besides, compensatory base changes to each of the rep mutations in the other sequence restored the ability to produce RepZ (8Asano K. Kato A. Moriwaki H. Hama C. Shiba K. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3774-3781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This intramolecular base pairing had the potential to form a pseudoknot with a stem-loop structure designated I which was predicted as the target site of Inc RNA. On the other hand, another stem-loop structure designated III sequestered the 5′-rCGCC-3′ sequence together with the repZ RBS. Based on these findings, we proposed a regulatory model (Fig. 1 B), in which translation and termination of repY induces the intramolecular base pairing, leading to form a novel RNA pseudoknot forrepZ translation. Inc RNA inhibits the formation of the pseudoknot, both directly and indirectly by inhibiting repYtranslation. Consistent with this model, disruption of structure III by two mutations (ΔG451 and C459A) resulted in partial derepression ofrepZ expression (9Asano K. Moriwaki H. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24549-24556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, Inc RNA inhibitedrepZ expression more efficiently than repYexpression (8Asano K. Kato A. Moriwaki H. Hama C. Shiba K. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3774-3781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, biochemical evidence for the proposed pseudoknot had not been provided.Figure 2Secondary structures of RepZ mRNA leader region. A and B, RNA120(corresponding to positions 244 to 353) or RNA293(corresponding to positions 244 to 523) was transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase and SmaI- orEcoO109I-digested pKA10 as template, respectively, labeled with 32P at the 5′ ends, and purified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These two RNA species (lanes 1–3 for RNA293 and lanes 4–6 for RNA120) were partially cleaved with RNase T1 (lanes 1 and 4), RNase Bc (lanes 2 and5), and RNase V1 (lanes 3 and 6), and the cleavage products were separated by 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of 8.3 m urea. Inpanel B, electrophoresis was carried out longer for the same samples shown in panel A. The lengths of cleavage products were measured by comparison with the RNase cleavage products of a sample of RNA293 or RNA120, cleaved at every nucleotide with NaOH, and compared with the positions in the ColIb-P9 sequence. Positions of some of the cleavage products are resolved to the left in the ColIb-P9 coordinate, numbered as in Fig. 1. Those mentioned in the text are in bold andhighlighted with arrows. Asterisks indicate undigested products. Locations of stem-loop structures are shown byvertical bars to the right of the relevant cleavage products. C, deduced secondary structures of RNA293. Nucleotide sequence of RNA293 is shown with the deduced secondary structures, named Ia to IV. Uppercase letters denote ribonucleotides derived from the ColIb-P9 portion, whereas lowercase letters denote those derived from the vector (pTZ19R) portion. Nucleotides are numbered as in Fig. 1. RNase T1, Bc, or V1 cleavage sites were indicated by filled, gray, or empty triangles, respectively. Nucleotide sequences that are complementary to each other and have a potential to form a pseudoknot with structure I are boxed. The initiation codons for repY and repZ are underlined. The termination codon of repY is double-underlined. The Shine-Dalgarno sequence for repZ translation is shown byasterisks. 3′-ends of shorter RNA species, RNA120 and RNA206, are shown byarrows. The 5′-ends of these RNAs are identical to that of RNA293.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Several other fundamental questions have arisen during the course of studies on the control of repZ translation: does pseudoknot formation simply expose the repZ RBS to the ribosome, or also enhance repZ translation through specific interaction with the ribosome? And why does a single base substitution in the proposed 5′-rGGCG-3′/5′-rCGCC-3′ duplex affect profoundly the intramolecular base pairing, when the complementary sequences consist of 7 bp or more (see Fig. 2 C)? What is the efficiency with which repY translation stimulate the initiation ofrepZ translation? To answer some of these questions, we set out to characterize biochemically the pseudoknot. In this report, we demonstrate that RepZ mRNA synthesized in vitro formed structures I and III, but not the pseudoknot. However, disruption of structure III by means of base substitution/deletion resulted in the formation of a unique RNA pseudoknot in vitro. Evidence is also presented indicating that the pseudoknot formed in vitro is generated in vivo, affecting directly the level of repZ expression.

Therefore, we re-constructed the wild type mini-ColIb-P9 as pAK10 (22Kato A. Mizobuchi K.

The specific activity of the enzyme was expressed as Miller units (23Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). The values reported here are the results of at least three independent experiments, and the standard deviations were within 15% of each value. RNA corresponding to the RepZ mRNA leader region was synthesized in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase. As the template we used SmaI-digested pKA10, pKA10-A25, and pKA10-A28 for wild-type RNA293, A25 RNA293, and A28 RNA290, respectively,EcoO109I-digested pKA10 for RNA120, andNdeI-digested pKA16 and pKA16-A10 for RNA206 andrep2044 RNA206, respectively. SmaI cleaves pKA10 and its derivatives at the multiple cloning site of the vector, 3′ to the ColIb-P9 insert, whereas EcoO109I cleaves in the middle of the ColIb-P9 portion, 3′ to the structure I region (see Fig. 1). NdeI cleaves pKA16 or its rep2044derivative at the NdeI site introduced in the middle of the structure III region of ColIb-P9 (Table I). For preparation of the 5′-end-labeled products, the reaction mixture of 50 μl contained 40 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 6 mmMgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mmspermidine, 2 mm each of ATP, CTP, and UTP, 0.5 mm GTP, 4.625 MBq of [γ-32P]GTP (222 TBq/mmol), 40 units of ribonuclease inhibitor (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto), 10 μg of T7 RNA polymerase (obtained from Shigeyuki Yokoyama, University of Tokyo), and 1 μg of template DNA. The reaction mixtures were incubated for 60 min at 37 °C, extracted with phenol/chloroform, and precipitated with ethanol, followed by gel purification (24Sambrook J. Fritsh E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The samples were suspended in the standard binding buffer described by Tomizawa (25Tomizawa J. Cell. 1984; 38: 861-870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). All the radioactive materials were purchased from New England Nuclear Research Products. The 5′-end-labeled RNA (0.1 μg/reaction) was digested with serially diluted RNase T1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), RNase derived from Bacillus cereus, RNase Bc (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), or RNase V1 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 6 μl of the standard binding buffer in the presence of 0.5 μg of yeast tRNAs. After incubation for 10 min at 37 °C, the reaction was stopped by adding 4 μl of stop solution (95% formamide, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue) and placed on ice. 3 μl of the sample was resolved by electrophoresis on a 8.3 m urea, 8% polyacrylamide gel. To characterize biochemically secondary structures in the RepZ mRNA leader region, we prepared in vitro RNA293labeled with 32P at the 5′-end as described under “Experimental Procedures.” This RNA corresponds to the wild-type ColIb-P9 sequence from positions 244 to 524 that covered the entire region containing structures I to III. After the RNA sample was partially digested by RNases T1 (specific for guanine residues in single-stranded regions), RNase Bc (specific for pyrimidines in single-stranded regions), or RNase V1 (specific for double-stranded regions), the resulting products were analyzed by electrophoresis on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The patterns of the autoradiography are shown in Fig. 2,A and B, and the cleavage sites identified are summarized in Fig. 2 C, in which the deduced secondary structures are also presented. We observed three stem-loop structures, I, II, and III as predicted previously (13Hama C. Takizawa T. Moriwaki H. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10666-10673Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, we found three new stem-loop structures designated Ia, IIa, and IV, which could not be predicted computationally. Note that RNase Bc appeared to cleave any ribonucleotides in the 5′ side of loop sequences in the assay condition employed in this study. When we looked at structure I and III regions which contained the two complementary sequences, 5′-rGGCG-3′ (position 327–330) and 5′-rCGCC-3′ (position 437–440), required for the intramolecular base pairing, two characteristic cleavage patterns were observed. First, both G-327 and G-328 residues in structure I were strongly cleaved by RNase T1 while both G-330 and G-331 residues were hardly cleaved (Fig.2 B, lane 1). Additionally, C-324, U-325, and U-326 were weakly cleaved by RNase Bc. We inferred from these patterns that the 5′-rUGGC-3′ (position 326–329) comprised the loop of structure I while C-324 and U-325 base paired weakly with G-331 and G-330, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2 C. Second, all 9 guanine residues except G-447 in the sequence from 436 to 462 were not cleaved by RNase T1, and C-440 was strongly cleaved by RNase V1 (Fig. 2 B, lanes 1 and3). Since G-445, G-455, and G-457 consist of parts of therepZ RBS (UAAG at position 442–447 as the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and GUG at position 455–457 as the repZ initiation codon) (9Asano K. Moriwaki H. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24549-24556Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Hama C. Takizawa T. Moriwaki H. Urasaki Y. Mizobuchi K. J. Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1983-1991Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), these results indicate that the translational initiation signals of repZ are embedded within structure III (Fig. 2 C). Likewise, the data showed that the 5′-rCGCC-3′ sequence is folded in structure III as well. Thus, these data, taken together, revealed that the intramolecular base pairing leading to the formation of a possible pseudoknot did not take place in vitro in the wild-type RNA293. This was further supported by the observation that the RNase cleavage patterns of structure I region in RNA120, a deletion of the wild-type RNA293 beyond position 353, were identical to those in RNA293 (Fig. 2, A and B). On the basis of the above results, we disrupted structure III by substituting 8 bases of its 3′ side sequence, 5′-rGCUUGUGGCAGG-3′, to adenine residues without changing the repZ RBS (the substituted bases are underlined in the sequence). The resulting multiple mutation was designated as A25. Secondary structures of A25 RNA293synthesized in vitro were analyzed in conjunction with mutation rep2041 (G330A) and rep2044 (G438A) defective in the intramolecular base pairing (8Asano K. Kato A. Moriwaki H. Hama C. Shiba K. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3774-3781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When compared with the wild-type RNA293, RNase T1 sensitivities at G-327 and G-328 in A25 RNA293 were substantially reduced, although the cleavage pattern of the sequence corresponding to the 3′ side of the structure I stem was not changed (A25 in Fig.3 A). Furthermore, the RNase V1 sensitivity at C-440 disappeared, indicating that structure III of A25 RNA293 was indeed disrupted by the base changes. On the other hand, when mutation rep2041or rep2044 was introduced into A25 RNA293, the degree of the RNase sensitivities of G-327 and G-328 was restored to that observed in the wild-type RNA293 (A26 and A32 in Fig.3 A). Since C-329 and G-330 had been shown to interact with G-438 and C-437 by base pairing, respectively (8Asano K. Kato A. Moriwaki H. Hama C. Shiba K. Mizobuchi K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3774-3781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), these results can be explained by suggesting that, in A25 RNA293, at least 5′-rGGCG-3′ in the loop of structure I base pairs with its complementary sequence 5′-rCGCC-3′ located in the unfolded structure III region to form an RNA pseudoknot as shown in Fig. 3 C(panel A25).Figure 3Secondary structures of mutant RNA293 derivatives with structure III disrupted. A and B, 5′-end-labeled RNA293 or its mutant derivatives were synthesized, and cleaved with RNase T1, Bc, or V1, and subjected to electrophoresis as in Fig. 2. Mutant RNAs were generated from pKA10-A25 (inc1 rep57 A25) (labeledA25), pKA10-A26 (inc1 rep57 A25 rep2041) (labeledA26), pKA10-A32 (inc1 rep57 A25 rep2044) (labeledA32), pKA10-A28 (inc1 rep57 A25 A28) (labeledA28), pKA10-A29 (inc1 rep57 A25 A28 rep2041) (labeled A29), and pKA10-A34 (inc1 rep57 A25 A28 rep2044) (labeled A34). inc1 andrep57 mutations do not change the cleavage patterns of RNA293 (data not shown). A part of the RNase T1 cleavage pattern corresponding to the structure I region is shown in panel A, whereas parts of RNase T1, Bc, and V1 cleavage patterns corresponding to the structure III region are shown in panel B (lanes 1–3, respectively). Representation schemes of the RNase cleavage products are the same as in Fig. 2, A andB, except that, in B, arrows highlighting the nucleotides mentioned in the text are emptied if the signal was weaker significantly than that of the parental species. Positions of structures III, IIIa, and IIIb are shown by vertical bars. C, parts of secondary structures of mutant RNA293derivatives near the structure I and III regions are depicted using the same symbols as in Fig. 2 C. Nucleotides altered in each RNA species are highlighted in black.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) However, we also observed in A25 RNA293 that G-438 and G-433 were weakly cleaved by RNase T1 and V1, respectively, whereas G-447 became insensitive to RNases T1 and Bc (A25 in Fig. 3 B, lanes 1–3). In addition, the degree of cleavage of G-438 and G-433 as observed in A25 was enhanced in both A26 and A32 RNAs293 except that in the latter the RNase T1 sensitivity of G-438 was lost due to the base change by mutation rep2044(Fig. 3 B). These results can be explained"
https://openalex.org/W2077903038,"Phenylalanine identity of yeast tRNAPhe is governed by five nucleotides including residues A73, G20, and the three anticodon nucleotides (Sampson et al., 1989, Science 243, 1363–1366).

Likely, no nucleotide within a tRNA is of random nature but has been selected so that a tRNA can fulfill all its functions efficiently. The specificity of transfer RNA aminoacylation is a crucial step in protein synthesis. Investigations during the last years have shown that the aminoacylation identity of a tRNA is linked to the presence of specific sets of signals allowing both discrimination by cognate aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs), 1The abbreviations used are: aaRS, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase; AlaRS, AspRS, PheRS, SerRS, ValRS, alanyl-, aspartyl-, phenylalanyl-, seryl-, and valyl-tRNA synthetases; DTE, diifthioerythritol. the positive elements, and rejection by noncognate synthetases, the negative elements or antideterminants (1Giegé R.

American Society of Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 335-347Google Scholar). The completeness of a set of positive elements has generally been tested by co-transplantation of the corresponding nucleotides into one or several noncognate host tRNAs that acquire the new aminoacylation properties. In several instances, this approach allowed detection of special requirements for the optimal expression of a given aminoacylation identity set within a host tRNA. Thus, minor elements and conformational features were shown to contribute to aminoacylation identities (e.g. Refs.4McClain W. Foss K. Jenkins R.A. Schneider J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9272-9276Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 5Francklyn C. Musier-Forsyth K. Schimmel P. Eur. J.

Recognition elements required for phenylalanylation of yeast tRNAPhe were defined in the pioneering work of Uhlenbeck and co-workers (9Sampson J.R. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar, 10Sampson J.R. DiRenzo A.B. Behlen L.S. Uhlenbeck O.C. Science. 1989; 24: 1363-1366Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar) as a set of five major elements. These elements correspond to G20, G34, A35, A36, and A73, and their competence to confer phenylalanine (Phe) identity was first demonstrated by transplantation into four host tRNAs that all acquired optimal phenylalanylation capacities (10Sampson J.R. DiRenzo A.B. Behlen L.S. Uhlenbeck O.C. Science. 1989; 24: 1363-1366Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Nucleotides involved in tertiary interactions were shown not to contribute to identity by a direct effect (11Sampson J. DiRenzo A.B. Behlen L.S. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2523-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Alternatively, expression of Phe identity in the yeast tRNAAsp context has revealed that PheRS is sensitive to fine local structural features, such as the D-loop and variable region structures (12Perret V. Florentz C. Puglisi J.D. Giegé R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Finally, in neither study based on sequence comparisons of natural or engineered Phe accepting species, nucleotides within the acceptor stem helix were found important for specificity. In a previous work, we have been able to create a chimeric tRNA, efficiently recognized and aminoacylated at once by three different aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases including yeast PheRS (6Frugier M. Florentz C. Schimmel P. Giegé R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14053-14061Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), and found that effective phenylalanylation of this tRNA was dependent, among other features, on the sequence of base pair 2–71 within the acceptor stem. Engineering of a tRNA with multiple specificities was based on the synthesis of a chimeric tRNAAsp containing the recognition sets for yeast PheRS (the five residues listed above), forEscherichia coli AlaRS (the G3-U70 base pair,e.g. Refs. 13Hou Y.-M. Schimmel P. Nature. 1988; 333: 140-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar and 14McClain W.H. Foss K. Science. 1988; 240: 793-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), and for yeast ValRS (A73 and A35; Ref. 15Florentz C. Dreher T.W. Rudinger J. Giegé R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 195: 229-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Notice that the valine identity residues A73 and A35 are common to the Phe recognition set. Simultaneous optimization of alanylation and phenylalanylation efficiencies could be achieved by insertion of specific structural features (the length of the α- and β-domains within the D-loop shaped to 4 and 2 nucleotides and the length of the variable region extended to 5 nucleotides) and mutation of base pair 2–71 in the amino acid acceptor stem from C-G to G-C (6Frugier M. Florentz C. Schimmel P. Giegé R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14053-14061Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Whereas the structural changes introduced were directed by already established yeast PheRS requirements (11Sampson J. DiRenzo A.B. Behlen L.S. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2523-2532Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 12Perret V. Florentz C. Puglisi J.D. Giegé R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), replacement of base pair C2-G71 by G2-C71 in the chimeric tRNAAsp transcript was guided by our present understanding of E. colitRNAAla identity. Indeed, this base pair is important for optimal alanine identity expression (5Francklyn C. Musier-Forsyth K. Schimmel P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 16Shi J.P. Francklyn C. Hill K. Schimmel P.

Science. 1989; 24: 1363-1366Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 18Sampson J.R. Behlen L.S. DiRenzo A.B. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4164-4167Google Scholar). Enhancement of phenylalanylation activity by insertion of a G2-C71 base pair was effective in three different structural contexts, all containing the G3-U70 base pair required for efficient alanylation (6Frugier M. Florentz C. Schimmel P. Giegé R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14053-14061Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Here, we basically investigate the role of base pairs 2–71 and 3–70 in Phe identity in yeast tRNAPhe as well as in the frameworks of yeast tRNAAsp and E. colitRNAAla. The kinetic data collected for various T7 transcripts demonstrate that these base pairs are involved in an optimal expression of the yeast tRNAPhe recognition set. Several possible roles played by these nucleotides are discussed. They do clearly not behave as positive recognition elements as commonly defined in the field. The new outcome of our studies is that the sequence of a tRNA, apart from the recognition elements and the consensus nucleotides involved in the establishment of the three-dimensional structure, is not random for aminoacylation. Some combinations are tolerated, others are not. Thus, specificity is linked to the set of positive and negative recognition elements as well as to an adequate sequence combination within the remaining domains of the tRNA. Oligonucleotides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 381 DNA synthesizer using the phosphoramidite method and purified by HPLC on a Nucleosyl 125–5-C18 column (Bischoff Chromatography, Zymark-France, Paris). l-[3H] phenylalanine (9.6 × 1011 Bq/mol) was from Amersham France (Les Ulis). Yeast PheRS was a gift of M. Baltzinger (Strasbourg). T7 RNA polymerase was purified according to method as described previously (19Wyatt J.R. Chastain M. Puglisi J.D. BioTechniques. 1991; 11: 764-769PubMed Google Scholar). Restriction enzymes (BstN1,HindIII, and BamHI) and T4 polynucleotide kinase were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). T4 DNA ligase was from Boehringer Mannheim (Meylan, France). All tRNAs used in this work have been obtained by in vitro transcription of synthetic genes. Each of these genes corresponds to the T7 RNA polymerase promoter region directly upstream of the tRNA sequence. The tRNA genes were constructed and cloned into plasmid pUC 119 linearized at BamHI and HindIII sites according to established methods (20Perret V. Florentz C. Giegé R. FEBS Lett. 1990; 270: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Tg1 cells were transformed. ABstN1 site coincidental with the 3′-end of the tRNA sequences allows synthesis of tRNAs ending with the expected CCA sequence. Experimental procedures were described previously (20Perret V. Florentz C. Giegé R. FEBS Lett. 1990; 270: 4-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).In vitro preparation and purification of transcripts was performed according to established procedures (6Frugier M. Florentz C. Schimmel P. Giegé R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14053-14061Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Concentration of stock solutions of transcripts have been determined by absorbency measurements at 260 nm. The primary structure of variants has been checked, in particular for the 5′-end G-rich regions where the sequences were carefully verified by appropriate sequencing methods (21Brownlee G.G. Work T.S. Work E. Determination of Sequences in RNA. Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. North Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam1972Google Scholar, 22Donnis-Keller H. Maxam A.M. Gilbert W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1977; 4: 2527-2538Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). The global folding of the variant transcripts was shown to be the same as that of wild-type tRNAPhe transcript, as demonstrated by structural mapping of the RNAs by lead according to procedures described previously (23Krzyzosiak W.J. Marciniec T. Wiewiorowsky M. Romby P. Ebel J.-P. Giegé R. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 5771-5777Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 24Behlen L.S. Sampson J.R. DiRenzo A.B. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 2515-2523Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Aminoacylation reactions of transcripts derived from tRNAAsp have been performed as described (6Frugier M. Florentz C. Schimmel P. Giegé R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14053-14061Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) in a medium containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 7.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ATP, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 50 μm[3H]-labeled phenylalanine, and adequate amounts of tRNA transcript and yeast PheRS. Aminoacylation reactions of transcripts derived from tRNAPhe and tRNAAlahave been performed in a medium containing 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 15 mm MgCl2, 12 mm ATP, 30 mm KCl, 4 mm DTE, 50 μm[3H]-labeled phenylalanine, tRNA transcript, and yeast PheRS (10Sampson J.R. DiRenzo A.B. Behlen L.S. Uhlenbeck O.C. Science. 1989; 24: 1363-1366Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Before aminoacylation, transcripts were renatured by heating at 65 °C for 90 s and slow cooling to room temperature. Assays were performed in the conventional way (25Perret V. Garcia A. Grosjean H. Ebel J.-P. Florentz C. Giegé R. Nature. 1990; 344: 787-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) with incubation at 30 °C. The kinetic constants were derived from Lineweaver-Burk plots. Since the concentration of amino acids is subsaturating, only apparent kinetic parameters are given. They represent an average of at least two independent experiments. Functional properties of mutants are expressed as catalytic efficiencies of phenylalanylation byk cat over K m ratios. For easier comparisons, these ratios are also normalized with regard to the wild-type molecule. All experiments performed in our previous work (6Frugier M. Florentz C. Schimmel P. Giegé R.

These transcripts contained systematically a G3-U70 base pair, necessary for an efficient concomitant alanylation (6Frugier M. Florentz C. Schimmel P. Giegé R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14053-14061Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Influence of this last base pair on the chimeric tRNAAsp phenylalanylation activity was tested by comparison with the activity of two types of tRNAAsp transcripts bearing the five primary Phe recognition nucleotides and various combinations at positions 2–71 and 3–70 (Fig.1). Variant A has the basic sequence of tRNAAsp, the structural framework of tRNAAsp, and the five phenylalanine identity nucleotides (12Perret V. Florentz C. Puglisi J.D. Giegé R. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 226: 323-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Variant B represents the corresponding transcript, containing a G3-U70 base pair. The kinetic parameters of these transcripts (TableI) show that the presence of base pair G3-U70 has only a very limited effect (at most, a 5-fold decrease on aminoacylation efficiency). In this context, when C2-G71 is replaced with G2-C71 (variant C), phenylalanylation efficiency is increased 60-fold. About the same effects were obtained when the structural framework of the host tRNAAsp was engineered to mimic the structural characteristics of tRNAPhe (in the D-loop and variable region; Ref. 6Frugier M. Florentz C. Schimmel P. Giegé R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14053-14061Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). This first set of data led us to suspect the positive effect of the combination of G2-C71/G3-U70 base pairs on phenylalanylation.Table IKinetic parameters for phenylalanylation by yeast PheRS of several transcripts bearing phenylalanine recognition nucleotidestRNA transcriptsBase pairs at position 2–71 & 3–70k cat(s −1)K m (nm)k cat/K m (×1000)k cat/K m (relative)L (-fold)Transcripts derived from yeast tRNAAspaPhenylalanylation conditions according to Ref. 6.

Open table in a new tab In order to study the role of base pairs 2–71 and 3–70 on phenylalanylation in the cognate natural tRNA framework, a series of mutants of yeast tRNAPhe presenting variations in their sequence have been prepared by in vitro transcription (Fig. 1). The wild-type tRNAPhe transcript presents the sequences C2-G71 and G3-C70, and is referred as molecule D in this work (Fig. 1). Four mutants were designed. Variants E and F differ from wild-type tRNAPhe only at the level of the second base pair, where C-G was replaced with A-U (variant E) or G-C (variant F). Variant G differs from wild-type at the third base pair by the presence of a G-U pair. This mutant was constructed to test the role of the alanine identity element G3-U70 alone in phenylalanylation. Finally, the last mutant (variant H) contains two concomitant substitutions in the acceptor stem, namely G2-C71 and G3-U70. Kinetic parameters characterizing the phenylalanylation capacity of these mutants are summarized in Fig. 1 and Table I. A dramatic effect is observed by inversion of base pair 2–71 from C-G to G-C (variant F), with of more than 1600-fold loss of phenylalanylation efficiency (in comparison to wild-type transcript D). This large decrease is due to a large drop of the rate constant (78-fold) and an increment ofK m by a factor 21 (Table I). Interestingly, the presence of an A-U base pair at this same position (variant E) has no effect on phenylalanylation efficiency. Conversion of base pair 3–70 from G-C to G-U in the tRNAPhe context (variant G), has only a moderate effect on phenylalanylation (5-fold decrease). The K m is increased about 6-fold and k cat is not quite affected (Table I). Interestingly, the double mutant (variant H) behaves like the wild-type transcript although it contains a mutation (G2-C71) that affects the aminoacylation in variant F in a strong negative manner. The aminoacylation rate of this mutant is two times better than for the wild-type tRNA, but K m is increased 3-fold. Thus, as in the tRNAAsp context, the presence of base pairs G2-C71/G3-U70 is positively recognized by PheRS in the tRNAPhe context. Effect of base pairs 2–71 and 3–70 on phenylalanylation has been further tested within a third tRNA context, namely E. coli tRNAAla. Sequences of the tested transcripts are displayed in Fig. 1. Note that these transcripts share the same fine structural characteristics as tRNAPhe in terms of d-loop and variable region organizations, namely the same length of the α and β regions in thed-loop and the same length of the variable region (v = 5). Since constant G18 and G19 residues in thed-loop make long range interactions with the T-loop, in particular the G19-C56 Watson-Crick pair, and that variable region residues are structurally related with d-loop and stem residues (e.g. the G15-C48 Levitt pair and the C13-G22-G46 triple), it can be concluded that the core of both tRNAPheand tRNAAla transcripts are similar and consequently that the two tRNAs present the same overall three-dimensional structure (1Giegé R. Puglisi J.D. Florentz C. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 45: 129-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar,6Frugier M. Florentz C. Schimmel P. Giegé R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14053-14061Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Variant I, a tRNAAla with the Phe recognition set and the same sequence as wild-type tRNAPhe at positions 2–71 and 3–70, is 85-fold less well aminoacylated than the reference tRNAPhe transcript. Both k cat andK m are about 10-fold lower. Interestingly, in variant J, as in tRNAPhe, a G2-C71/G3-C70 combination of nucleotides has a dramatic negative consequence on phenylalanylation with a loss in aminoacylation efficiency of 2100-fold. Finally, sequence combinations C2-G71/G3-U70 or G2-C71/G3-U70 lead to efficient phenylalanylation of tRNAAla-derived tRNAs (L = 1 and L = 14, respectively, for variants K and L), as is the case in the tRNAPhe context (variant H). Calculation of thermodynamic stabilities of RNA helices was according to Turner et al.(26Turner D.H. Sugimoto N. Freier S.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 167-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar). In the presence of a G3-C70 pair, the free energy of the tRNAPhe accepting helix is between 2 and 3 kcal/mol lower than in the presence of G3-U70. Indeed, in the case of the tRNAPhe framework, the combination G2-C71/G3-C70 confers a free energy of −7.1 kcal/mol, whereas G2-C71/G3-U70 confers only −5.4 kcal/mol. Similarly, in the tRNAAla framework, a G-C/G-C combination leads to −8.7 kcal/mol, whereas a G-C/G-U combination leads only to −5.7 kcal/mol. First, we recall that the tRNAs investigated here possess the foreseen sequences and fold correctly as verified by sequence analysis and structural mapping with lead (data not shown). Further, these molecules, aside from containing the Phe recognition elements, possess all the same sequences at their amino acid-accepting extremities, namely a G1-C72 base pair extended by a 3′ A73CCA-end. In what follows, and for the sake of simplicity, we assume that the variations in their phenylalanylation properties are essentially due to the nucleotide combinations at positions 2–71 and 3–70, although we are aware that additional effects can occur (see below). To facilitate discussion, data are summarized in TableII. Variants are classified as a function of their decreasing ability to be phenylalanylated (increasingL-values) and are divided into six groups (a to f) on the basis of the nature of their 2–71 and 3–70 base pairs, and individual kinetic parameters are normalized so that relative contributions ofk cat and K m to Lcan be easily compared. Several features become immediately apparent. Similar L-values can result from different combinations ofk cat and K m . This is for instance, the case when comparing the phenylalanylation capacities of variants H and K. The normalized k cat andK m show that efficient variants (L< 5) behave phenomenologically either as wild-type tRNAPhe(variants K and E) or are charged in a mechanism where their binding to PheRS is decreased (normalized K m > 1) andk cat improved (variants H, C, and G). Interestingly, in variants with impaired aminoacylation capacity (L > 5), the contribution ofk cat is preponderant, except for variant I.Table IIRanking of tRNA variants as a function of their efficiency to be phenylalanylated and comparison of the relative contributions of k cat and K m in chargingtRNA frameworkName of variants & base pairs 2–71/3–70L (-fold)Normalized values of k cat and K m for L = 1abcdefC-G G-CG-C G-UG-C G-CC-G G-UA-U G-CC-G C-G(k cat)N(K m )NPhe—————11.001.00Phe—H————10.392.59Ala———K——11.140.88Phe————E—30.851.19Asp—C————40.372.70Phe———G——50.362.81Ala—L————152.040.49Asp—————A482.870.35AlaI—————861.100.92Asp———B——2432.140.47Phe——F———16751.930.51Ala——J———20962.500.40 Open table in a new tab Among the 11 tRNA variants possessing the basic Phe recognition set and mutations at base pairs 2–71 and/or 3–70, two mutants with a G2-C71 base pair have drastically decreased aminoacylation efficiencies as compared with wild-type tRNAPhe (variants F and J). The magnitude of the effects, with l-values of 1675 to 2100, is much greater than that observed after mutation of the “classical” Phe recognition elements where losses varied from 10- to 260-fold (10Sampson J.R. DiRenzo A.B. Behlen L.S. Uhlenbeck O.C. Science. 1989; 24: 1363-1366Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 18Sampson J.R. Behlen L.S. DiRenzo A.B. Uhlenbeck O.C. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4164-4167Google Scholar). But, analysis of tRNA variants presenting a G-C/G-U combination at positions 2–71/3–70, shows that the dramatic negative effect brought by G2-C71 in the tRNAPhe and tRNAAla contexts (variants F and J), is compensated by the G3-U70 base pair (variants H, C, and L). Notably, the G2-C71/G3-U70 combination in the tRNAAspframework has a positive effect (variant C). According to the current view, tRNA aminoacylations are ensured by a limited number of nucleotides acting as positive signals (1Giegé R. Puglisi J.D. Florentz C. Prog. Nucleic Acid Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 45: 129-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 2Saks M.E. Sampson J.R. Abelson J.N. Science. 1994; 263: 191-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 3McClain W.H. Söll D. RajBhandary U.L. tRNA: Structure, Biosynthesis, and Function. American Society of Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1995: 335-347Google Scholar). They are presented within optimal structural scaffolds and are generally in direct contact with specific amino acids of synthetases. This definition has two implications. First, mutations at recognition positions should lead to strong losses in aminoacylation efficiency, due to the disappearance of proper hydrogen bonds. Second, transplantation of recognition elements into host tRNA frameworks should be sufficient for acquisition of the corresponding aminoacylation identity by the chimeric tRNAs. The properties of the C2-G71 base pair are not explained by the above scheme. Indeed, our results, combined with those of Uhlenbeck's laboratory, suggest that PheRS makes no distinction between a U-A, A-U, or C-G base pair at position 2–71, and G-C is the only pair to considerably decrease aminoacylation efficiency of the tRNAs chargeable with phenylalanine. Moreover, C2-G71 is not necessary to confer an efficient Phe identity to a host tRNA. Thus, C2-G71 is not a positive identity element. Alternatively, mutation of a neutral element, by definition an element that does not belong to the recognition set, can also lead to a dramatic loss in aminoacylation efficiency. This is the case if this “neutral” element is replaced by a negative element that can act by introducing a repelling chemical group toward the synthetase or an unfavorable structural context, hindering the correct local or long-range positioning of the substrate. Thus G2-C71 has to be considered as a “negative” element. However, it is not clear if this base pair is in direct contact with the synthetase, although footprinting of natural fully modified tRNAPhe with yeast PheRS showed protection of phosphates 69 and 70 against ethylnitrosourea alkylation (27Romby P. Moras D. Bergdoll M. Dumas P. Vlassov V.V. Westhof E. Ebel J.- P. Giegé R. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 455-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). The recent crystal structure of the tRNAPhe/PheRS complex from Thermus thermophilus(28Goldgur Y. Mosyak L. Reshetnikova L. Ankilova V. Lavrik O. Khodyreva S. Safro M. Structure. 1997; 5: 59-68Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar) indicates that there is no contact between the enzyme and base pairs 2–71 and 3–70 of the tRNA. Expression of the information carried by base pair G2-C71 is largely dependent on the sequence of base pair 3–70. Its negative effect, observed when position 3–70 is a G-C pair (variants F and J), is balanced by the presence of a G3-U70 pair (variants H and L). Thus, a given base pair affect phenylalanylation differently according to the tRNA framework into which it is embedded. Here again, G3-U70 cannot by itself be considered as a positive recognition signal for yeast PheRS. This conclusion is in line with the great sequence variability of base pair 3–70 among the host tRNAs into which the Phe recognition set has been transplanted (C-G in S. pombe tRNAPhe; G-C inE. coli, yeast, and wheat germ tRNAPhe and yeast tRNATyr; U-A in yeast tRNAMet; and G-U in yeast tRNAArg) (10Sampson J.R. DiRenzo A.B. Behlen L.S. Uhlenbeck O.C. Science. 1989; 24: 1363-1366Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar). The positive effect brought by the G2-C71/G3-U70 combination may be related to the structural characteristics of the G-U pair that decrease the stability of the acceptor stem in comparison with a stem with standard Watson-Crick pairings. We recall that G-U base pairs are important in protein-RNA interactions in general, and in tRNA recognition in particular. For instance, the G3-U70 pair in tRNAAla is the major alanine identity element for AlaRS andin E. coli is involved in a subtle recognition process by the synthetase (4McClain W. Foss K. Jenkins R.A.

Science. 1996; 271: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In addition to the presence of the exocyclic amino group in the minor groove of the RNA helix, a G-U pair decreases the helix stability as compared with its G-C equivalent since it contains only two hydrogen bonds (33Ladner J.E. Jack A. Robertus J.D. Brown R.S. Rhodes D. Clark B.F.C. Klug A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 4414-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 34Rhodes D. Eur. J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 4811-4824Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). Unlike a G-C pair, a G-U pair was shown, by NMR, to induce a variation in the local helix geometry (36Allain F.H.T. Varani G. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 333-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 37Limmer S. Reif B. Ott G. Arnold L. Sprinzl M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 38Ramos A. Varani G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2083-2090Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). For example, in an RNA helix mimicking the tRNAAla acceptor stem, the G-U pair displaces nucleotide C71 and reduces the stacking of the four unpaired nucleotides at the 3′-extremity of the helix (37Limmer S. Reif B. Ott G. Arnold L. Sprinzl M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 15-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). The yeast tRNAAsp anticodon helix is another example where a noncanonical G-U pair plays an role in the interaction process with its cognate synthetase by destabilizing an RNA helix. In this case, the G30-U40 pair was shown to be the site of a kink (39Westhof E. Dumas P. Moras D. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 119-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar) that allows adaptation of the anticodon nucleotides with the AspRS anticodon binding domain (40Cavarelli J. Rees B. Ruff M. Poterszman A. Thierry J.-C. Moras D. Structural Tools for the Analysis of Protein-Nucleic Acid Complexes. Birkhäuser Verlag, Basel, Switzerland1992: 287-298Google Scholar). Within these lines, we suggest that introduction of a G3-U70 pair into tRNAs inactive for phenylalanylation brings sufficient flexibility into the acceptor stem to allow a fruitful adaptation of the tRNA to PheRS. Similar interpretation has been given to explain the role of G3-U70 in Ala identity in vivo (32Gabriel K. Schneider J. McClain W.H. Science. 1996; 271: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), although in that case other in vitro data argue that direct recognition of this pair by the synthetase is more important than helical distortion (41Beuning P.J. Yang F. Schimmel P. Musier-Forsyth K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10150-10154Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Calculations of the thermodynamic stability (26Turner D.H. Sugimoto N. Freier S.M. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 167-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) of the acceptor helix part estimated for the top four base pairs of the series of variants investigated here argue in this way. The G3-U70 base pair considerably decreases the stability of the acceptor stem, and the flexibility brought by the G2-C71/G3-U70 combination may be sufficient to recover the correct position of the CCA-accepting end. In contrast, when the combination G2-C71/G3-C70 is present, the stability of the acceptor stem is increased, and thus its optimal adaptation on the catalytic domain of the synthetase is prevented. The same conclusion was reached by Saks and Sampson (42Saks M.E. Sampson J.R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2843-2849Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), who observed that base pair 3–70 in the acceptor stem of E. coli tRNASer, which does not contact directly the enzyme, can affect interactions between the neighboring base pairs and SerRS. In this case also, the phenomenon seems to correlate with a decreased flexibility of the acceptor stem, and base pair 3–70 was quoted in this case, a “cryptic” recognition element. Involvement of the presently discussed elements at positions 2–70 and 3–71 escaped previous studies although several transplantation experiments were performed. Here, a mutational analysis dictated by serendipitous observations during identity engineering studies (6Frugier M. Florentz C. Schimmel P. Giegé R. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 14053-14061Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), has revealed that tRNA nucleotides outside the already reported PheRS recognition set (9Sampson J.R. Uhlenbeck O.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1033-1037Crossref PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar,10Sampson J.R. DiRenzo A.B. Behlen L.S. Uhlenbeck O.C. Science. 1989; 24: 1363-1366Crossref Scopus (148) Google Scholar) can be of great influence on the expression of Phe identity. This analysis has in particular shown that PheRS accommodates equally well at least three different base pairs at position 2–71. In addition, the present experiments show that PheRS is sensitive to base pair combinations at positions 2–71 and 3–70 in host tRNAs embedding the canonical Phe recognition elements. In particular, the presence of two consecutive G-C pairs at position 2–71 and 3–70 considerably reduces phenylalanylation."

The eukaryotic type IB DNA topoisomerase family includes topoisomerase I, a ubiquitous nuclear enzyme, and the topoisomerases encoded by vaccinia and other cytoplasmic poxviruses (1Wang J.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 635-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (2086) Google Scholar). These proteins relax supercoiled DNA via a common reaction pathway, which involves noncovalent binding of the topoisomerase to duplex DNA, cleavage of one DNA strand with concomitant formation of a covalent DNA-(3′-phosphotyrosyl)-protein intermediate, strand passage, and strand religation. Our aim is to understand the structural requirements for DNA recognition and transesterification chemistry. Toward that end, we have undertaken a structure-function analysis of the vaccinia topoisomerase. The 314-amino acid vaccinia enzyme is the smallest topoisomerase known and thus affords a more tractable target for structure-function studies than the cellular type IB enzymes, which range from 765 to 1019 amino acids (2Shuman S.

Acta. 1995; 1262: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Another attractive feature of the vaccinia topoisomerase is its sequence specificity in transesterification; it forms a covalent adduct at sites containing the sequence 5′-(C/T)CCTT↓ immediately 5′ of the scissile phosphodiester (4Shuman S.

The vaccinia virus topoisomerase consists of three protease-resistant polypeptide fragments separated by two protease-sensitive interdomain segments, which we have referred to as the bridge and hinge (Fig. 1) (8Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11636-11645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Specific functional groups identified through mutagenesis as being required for transesterification chemistry are situated near the hinge and within the C-terminal domain. These include the active site nucleophile (Tyr-274) and four other residues (Arg-130, Lys-167, Arg-223, and His-265) that are essential for the DNA cleavage and religation steps (11Morham S.G.

Two other residues (Gly-132 and Tyr-136) are critical for the cleavage reaction, but not for religation (17Wittschieben J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3001-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). None of the essential residues appears to play a role in target site affinity, insofar as alanine substitutions that elicit from 10−2 to 10−7 decrements in transesterification rate have no significant effect on the noncovalent binding of topoisomerase to CCCTT-containing duplex DNA (17Wittschieben J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3001-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The interdomain bridge is defined by trypsin-accessible sites at Arg-80, Lys-83, and Arg-84 (8Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11636-11645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 20Sharma A. Hanai R. Mondragon A. Structure. 1994; 2: 767-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Residues implicated in noncovalent DNA binding are situated within the bridge and in the N-terminal domain just proximal to the bridge. Tyr-70 and Tyr-72 were identified as the sites of UV cross-linking between topoisomerase and the +4 and +3 bromocytosine-substituted bases, respectively, of the CCCTT element (9Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3448-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the N-terminal domain suggests that Arg-67, Tyr-70, Tyr-72, and Arg-80 contribute to target site affinity (18Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids. Res. 1997; 25: 3649-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Mutational effects on DNA binding are evinced by inhibition of topoisomerase activity in the presence of magnesium and salt (16Wang L.K. Wittschieben J. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7944-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 18Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids. Res. 1997; 25: 3649-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). These results have prompted the suggestion (9Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3448-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) that low affinity DNA binding and reaction chemistry are performed by the carboxyl two-thirds of the vaccinia enzyme, the sequence of which is similar to that of the cellular topoisomerases, whereas discrimination of the DNA sequence at the cleavage site is facilitated by the N-terminal domain, which is divergent in sequence and three-dimensional structure between the viral and cellular enzymes (20Sharma A. Hanai R. Mondragon A. Structure. 1994; 2: 767-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Lue N. Sharma A. Mondragon A. Wang J.C. Structure. 1995; 3: 1315-1322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that a deleted version of vaccinia topoisomerase, Topo-(81–314), that lacks the N-terminal 80-amino acid domain (Fig. 1), is active in relaxing supercoiled DNA, but is exquisitely sensitive to inhibition by salt or magnesium. The capacity of Topo-(81–314) to cleave a CCCTT-containing substrate under nonstringent conditions suggests that the catalytic domain per se can discriminate the target site. We propose a revised model for catalysis whereby the N-terminal domain enhances DNA binding and is required for a pre-cleavage conformational step. The segment of the vaccinia virus topoisomerase gene encoding amino acids 81–314 was polymerase chain reaction-amplified using a sense-strand oligonucleotide primer that introduced an internalNdeI restriction site (CATATG) with an in-frame methionine codon in lieu of the codon for Arg-80. AnNdeI-BglII restriction fragment containing the truncated topoisomerase gene was cloned into the T7-based expression vector pET3c to yield pET-Topo-(81–314). The entire insert of this plasmid was sequenced to confirm that no unwanted mutations had been introduced during amplification or cloning. The pET-Topo-(81–314) plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21. Topo-(81–314) expression was induced by infection with bacteriophage λCE6 (22Shuman S. Golder M. Moss B. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16401-16407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Topo-(81–314) was purified from soluble bacterial lysates by phosphocellulose column chromatography and glycerol gradient sedimentation. The elution and sedimentation profiles of the Topo-(81–314) polypeptide were monitored by SDS-PAGE 1The abbreviations used are: PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; WT, wild type; DTT, dithiothreitol; bp, base pair(s). of the column and gradient fractions. Topo-(81–314) adsorbed to phosphocellulose in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 10 mmEDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10% sucrose) containing 150 mmNaCl, remained bound during a wash with buffer A (50 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100) containing 0.5 m NaCl, and was recovered by step elution with buffer A containing 1.0m NaCl. An aliquot of the phosphocellulose preparation (250 μg) was applied to a 4.8-ml 15–30% glycerol gradient in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mm NaCl, 2 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100. The gradient was centrifuged for 30 h at 50,000 rpm in a Beckman SW50 rotor. Fractions (0.2 ml) were collected dropwise from the bottom of the tube. Full-length wild type topoisomerase and the double alanine-substitution mutant Topo(Y70A/Y72A) were purified from soluble bacterial lysates by phosphocellulose column chromatography and glycerol gradient sedimentation as described above for Topo-(81–314). The protein concentrations of the topoisomerase preparations were determined by using the dye-binding method (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as the standard. Topo-(81–314) is a truncated version of vaccinia topoisomerase that lacks the N-terminal structural domain defined by limited proteolysis with trypsin (Fig.1). Topo-(81–314) was expressed in bacteria and purified from soluble lysates by phosphocellulose chromatography and glycerol gradient sedimentation. The 27-kDa Topo-(81–314) polypeptide sedimented as a discrete peak (Fig.2). The N-terminal sequence of this species was determined by automated Edman chemistry after transferring the 27-kDa polypeptide from an SDS-polyacrylamide gel to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (8Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11636-11645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence (MNAKRDRIF) confirmed that the protein we purified was indeed Topo-(81–314). A single peak of DNA supercoil relaxation activity cosedimented with the Topo-(81–314) protein (Fig. 2). The rates of DNA relaxation by Topo-(81–314) and full-length wild type (WT) topoisomerase were compared at 25 nm input protein (Fig. 3). Screening assays were performed in the absence of added salt or magnesium (Fig. 3, Control). The rate of DNA relaxation by WT topoisomerase under these conditions was proportional to enzyme concentration from 8 nm to 100 nm (data not shown); higher concentrations were not tested. 25 nm WT topoisomerase relaxed 0.3 μg of supercoiled pUC19 DNA to completion within 5–10 min. Reaction products of intermediate superhelicity were not observed, suggesting that the WT enzyme relaxed individual DNA molecules to completion before dissociating and engaging a new DNA. 25 nm Topo-(81–314) relaxed all input supercoiled DNA within 30 min, as evinced by the decay of the supercoiled substrate. However, in contrast to WT, the truncated enzyme accumulated partially relaxed intermediates (e.g. at 10 and 20 min) and did not relax the DNA to completion even after 60 min (Fig. 3). This suggested that Topo-(81–314) acted distributively on supercoiled plasmid DNA. The DNA relaxation assays were also performed in the presence of 100 mm NaCl or 5 mm MgCl2. Either salt or magnesium stimulated the relaxation rate of the WT enzyme ∼20-fold, such that all supercoils were relaxed in 15–30 s (Fig. 3). Salt and magnesium together have an additive effect on relaxation rate (23Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29760-29764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); this is not apparent in Fig. 3, because the reaction was complete with either solute alone at the earliest time analyzed. The response of Topo-(81–314) to salt and magnesium was the exact opposite of the WT protein. Relaxation by Topo-(81–314) was slowed severely by 100 mm NaCl; MgCl2 blocked activity almost completely (Fig. 3). The combination of salt and magnesium was similarly deleterious. Prior studies indicated that product dissociation is rate-limiting during relaxation by WT enzyme in the absence of salt or magnesium. Salt and magnesium stimulate relaxation by enhancing product off-rate, without affecting the rate of DNA cleavage by the WT topoisomerase (23Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29760-29764Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,24Stivers J.T. Shuman S. Mildvan A.S. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 327-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In the presence of salt plus magnesium, the DNA cleavage step is apparently rate-limiting. The paradoxical response of Topo-(81–314) to salt and magnesium is strongly suggestive of reduced affinity of the truncated protein for the DNA substrate. Strand cleavage is likely to be rate-limiting in the absence of salt or magnesium. However, in the presence of salt or magnesium, the DNA binding step becomes limiting for Topo-(81–314). The relative rates of DNA cleavage can be gauged crudely by comparing the WT relaxation rate in the presence of salt and magnesium to the relaxation rate of Topo-(81–314) in the absence of added solutes. By this criteria, we estimate that the rate of DNA cleavage by Topo-(1–314) was less than 1% of the WT rate. A DNA substrate containing a single CCCTT↓ site was used to examine DNA cleavage under single-turnover conditions. The substrate consisted of a 5′ 32P-labeled 18-mer scissile strand 5′-pCGTGTCGCCCTTATTCCC annealed to a 30-mer strand 3′-GCACAGCGGGAATAAGGCTATCACTGATGT to produce an 18-mer duplex with a 12-mer 5′ tail (Fig. 4). Upon formation of the covalent protein-DNA adduct, the distal cleavage product 5′-ATTCCC is released and the enzyme remains bound to the32P-labeled 12-mer strand pCGTGTCGCCCTTp. The labeled protein-DNA adduct formed by WT topoisomerase migrated as a discrete species of ∼40 kDa during SDS-PAGE (Fig.5, left panel). In reactions containing 25 nm 18-mer/30-mer DNA and 125 nmWT topoisomerase, 95% of the input DNA became covalently bound to protein and the reaction was nearly complete within 10 s at 37 °C. The observed cleavage rate constant (k cl) for the WT topoisomerase was 0.28 s−1 (14Petersen B.Ø. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 15Cheng C. Wang L.K. Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8263-8269Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We found that Topo-(81–314) cleaved the 18-mer strand to form a labeled protein-DNA adduct that migrated at ∼32 kDa during SDS-PAGE (Fig. 5, left panel, ΔN). The faster electrophoretic mobility of the Topo-(81–314)–DNA adduct was consistent with the smaller size of the Topo-(81–314) polypeptide.Figure 5DNA cleavage and religation by WT topoisomerase and Topo-(81–314). Reaction mixtures containing (per 20 μl) 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 pmol of 18-mer/30-mer DNA, and 2.5 pmol of WT topoisomerase or Topo-(81–314) were incubated at 37 °C for either 5 min (WT) or 6 h (Topo(81–314)). At this point (religation time 0), duplicate aliquots (20 μl) were withdrawn from each mixture and quenched either with SDS-PAGE sample buffer or with formamide stop buffer (1% SDS, 95% formamide, 20 mm EDTA). The cleavage reaction products formed by WT topoisomerase and Topo-(81–314) (ΔN) in SDS-sample buffer were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. An autoradiograph of the dried gel is shown in the left panel(Cleavage). The positions and sizes (in kDa) of coelectrophoresed prestained marker proteins are indicated. Religation was initiated by adding a 5′-hydroxyl terminated 18-mer strand (5′-ATTCCGATAGTGACTACA) to the reaction mixtures at a concentration of 25 pmol/20 μl and simultaneously adjusting the mixtures to 0.3m NaCl. Aliquots (20 μl) were withdrawn after 10, 30, and 60 s and quenched immediately in formamide stop buffer. The samples were electrophoresed through a 15% polyacrylamide gel containing 7 m urea in TBE (90 mm Tris borate, 2.5 mm EDTA). A control sample containing the input DNA substrate, but lacking topoisomerase, was analyzed in parallel (lane −). An autoradiogram of the gel is shown in theright panel. The positions of the input 18-mer scissile strand and the 30-mer strand transfer product are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Topo-(81–314) cleaved the 18-mer/30-mer DNA very slowly (Fig. 4). An end point of 87% label transfer was attained at 24 h. The apparent cleavage rate constant (k cl) was 7 × 10−5 s−1. Thus, the rate of DNA cleavage by Topo-(81–314) was slower than WT by a factor of 10−3.6. Because the observed k cldid not increase when the Topo-(81–314) concentration was doubled, we surmise that deletion of the N-terminal domain affects either transesterification chemistry per se or a step in the reaction pathway that occurs after initial binding, but prior to strand scission. The site specificity of cleavage of the 18-mer scissile strand by Topo-(81–314) was initially compared with that of the WT enzyme by treating the respective covalent adducts with proteinase K in the presence of SDS, then resolving the digestion products by electrophoresis through a 17% polyacrylamide gel containing 7m urea. Digestion of the wild type covalent adduct yielded a cluster of labeled species migrating faster than the 18-mer input strand, but slower than a free 12-mer strand (data not shown). These digestion products consisted of the 12-mer oligonucleotide 5′-pCGTGTCGCCCTTp linked to short peptides of heterogeneous size. Digestion of the Topo-(81–314) covalent adduct yielded an identical cluster of 32P-labeled DNA-peptide adducts (data not shown). Because any alteration in the site of covalent adduct formation on the 32P-labeled scissile strand would result in an easily detectable shift in the mobility of the proteinase K digestion products (25Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1796-1803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we surmise that Topo-(81–314) transesterified at the same phosphodiester bond as the WT enzyme. The religation reaction was studied under single-turnover conditions by assaying the ability of the covalent intermediate to transfer the covalently held 5′ 32P-labeled 12-mer strand to a 5′-hydroxyl-terminated 18-mer strand to form a 30-mer product (26Sekiguchi J. Cheng C. Shuman J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15721-15728Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). WT topoisomerase and Topo-(81–314) were first preincubated with the 18-mer/30-mer substrate. DNA analysis by denaturing gel electrophoresis established that virtually all of the input 32P-labeled 18-mer strand had reacted with the WT topoisomerase (as gauged by disappearance of the 18-mer scissile strand; note that the covalent protein-DNA adduct does not enter the gel), whereas Topo-(81–314) reacted with ∼70% of the substrate (Fig. 5, right panel, time 0 lanes). The religation reaction was initiated by adding a 50-fold molar excess of an 18-mer acceptor strand complementary to the 5′ tail of the covalent intermediate. The reaction mixture was adjusted simultaneously to 0.3m NaCl. Addition of NaCl during the religation phase promotes dissociation of the topoisomerase after strand closure and completely prevents recleavage of the strand transfer product. Religation by WT topoisomerase to form the 30-mer strand transfer product was complete within 10 s (Fig. 5, right panel). Remarkably, so was the religation reaction catalyzed by Topo-(81–314). This was in stark contrast to the severe rate defect evinced by Topo-(81–314) in the forward cleavage reaction. The religation results show that Topo-(81–314) catalyzed transesterification reaction chemistry at a near-wild type rate. The fact that the strand transfer product generated by Topo-(81–314) was identical in size to that formed by WT topoisomerase provides additional proof that the truncated enzyme cleaved the scissile strand at the CCCTTp↓A phosphodiester (Fig. 5). A profound and selective decrement in the rate of single-turnover strand cleavage versus religation should result in a drastic decrease in K eq when Topo-(81–314) reacts with CCCTT-containing DNA under equilibrium conditions (17Wittschieben J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3001-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). WT topoisomerase attains a cleavage-religation equilibrium on a 60-bp duplex containing a centrally placed CCCTT element, such that ∼20% of the substrate is covalently bound to the enzyme (17Wittschieben J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3001-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the 60-bp equilibrium substrate by Topo-(81–314) was barely detectable; <0.1% of the scissile strand became covalently bound (data not shown). Single turnover cleavage reactions are routinely performed at low ionic strength in the absence of a divalent cation. The findings that DNA relaxation by Topo-(81–314) was inhibited by 0.1m NaCl and 5 mm MgCl2 suggested that pre-cleavage binding might be rate-limiting under those more stringent conditions. To address this issue, we examined the effects of salt and magnesium on cleavage of the 18-mer/30-mer substrate. The amounts of covalent adduct formed in the presence of 50, 100, 150, and 200 mm NaCl or 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 mmMgCl2 were measured and normalized to the extent of cleavage in unsupplemented control reactions. WT topoisomerase cleavage reactions were quenched after 10 s, whereas Topo-(81–314) reactions were terminated after 6 h. The reaction times were chosen to attain comparable sensitivity for the effects of solution parameters on the cleavage reaction. The salt effects are shown in Fig.6 A; magnesium effects are shown in Fig. 6 B. We observed that the WT topoisomerase was unaffected by up to 150 mm NaCl, but was inhibited by 26% at 200 mm NaCl. In contrast, covalent adduct formation by Topo-(81–314) was salt-sensitive; Topo-(81–314) was inhibited 29% and 85%, respectively, by 50 and 100 mm NaCl. Topo-(81–314) cleavage activity was abolished at 150 mmand 200 mm NaCl (Fig. 5 A). WT topoisomerase was unaffected by magnesium up to 8 mm, whereas Topo-(81–314) was inhibited progressively by 1–8 mm MgCl2. 52% inhibition occurred at 1 mm MgCl2 and 88% inhibition was observed at 6 mm MgCl2 (Fig.5 B). Susceptibility to salt and magnesium inhibition indicates that deletion of the N-terminal domain results in decreased affinity for the CCCTT-containing DNA substrate. The noncovalent binding of Topo-(81–314) to a 32P-labeled 60-bp DNA containing a single centrally placed CCCTT site (17Wittschieben J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3001-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) was assessed by native gel electrophoresis (27Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 24: 5360-5365Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The full-sized active site mutant protein Topo(Phe-274) was analyzed in parallel (Fig.7). The binding reaction mixtures contained no added salt or magnesium. The Phe-274 protein bound to the 60-mer ligand to form a single discrete complex of retarded electrophoretic mobility (indicated by the asterisk in Fig.7). The extent of complex formation was proportional to input Phe-274 topoisomerase and was near quantitative at a 2:1 molar ratio of protein to DNA. Increasing the concentration of Phe-274 to attain 5:1 and 10:1 molar ratios of protein to DNA resulted in the appearance of at least two more slowly migrating complexes (Fig. 7). We presume that this reflects the binding of one or two more topoisomerase monomers to the 60-bp DNA. We showed previously that Phe-274 topoisomerase binds at nonspecific sites on duplex DNA with 7–10-fold lower affinity than to CCCTT sites (27Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 24: 5360-5365Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The same is true of noncovalent binding by WT topoisomerase (27Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 24: 5360-5365Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Incubation of Topo-(81–314) with the 60-mer ligand resulted in the formation of a somewhat diffuse smear of slowly migrating material (Fig. 7). We estimate from the protein concentrations required to attain a comparable decrease in the residual unbound DNA that Topo-(81–314) bound the 60-mer with one-fifth the affinity of the full-sized enzyme. To address the possibility that the altered biochemical properties of recombinant Topo-(81–314) were caused by aberrant protein folding, we probed the structure of Topo-(81–314) by digestion with increasing concentrations of chymotrypsin. At limiting protease concentrations, Topo-(81–314) was cleaved to yield a predominant polypeptide fragment of 20 kDa and a minor fragment of 18 kDa (Fig.8). The 20-kDa carboxyl species was resistant to digestion by a level of chymotrypsin sufficient to cleave all the input Topo-(81–314). The 18-kDa polypeptide increased in abundance at the higher levels of protease. Sequencing of these polypeptides by automated Edman chemistry after transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane revealed that the 20-kDa species arose via cleavage between amino acids Tyr-136 and Leu-137 and the 18-kDa species arose via cleavage between residues Leu-146 and Thr-147. These two sites of chymotrypsin cleavage of Topo-(81–314) correspond precisely to the chymotrypsin-accessible sites in the hinge region of the WT topoisomerase (8Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11636-11645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). This result suggests that recombinant Topo-(81–314) was folded properly. In light of prior findings that two specific residues within the N-terminal domain (Tyr-70 and Tyr-72) make major groove contacts with the nucleotide bases of the CCCTT target site (9Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3448-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), we considered the hypothesis that loss of these contacts might account for the effects of N-terminal domain removal on DNA binding and cleavage. To address this point, we purified and characterized a mutated version of the full-length vaccinia topoisomerase, Topo(Y70A/Y72A), in which Tyr-70 and Tyr-72 were both replaced by alanine. Previously, we reported the effects of single alanine-substitutions at Tyr-70 and Tyr-72 (18Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids. Res. 1997; 25: 3649-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The Y70A mutation had no effect on the kinetics of DNA relaxation in the presence of 0.1m NaCl. However, Y70A mutant displayed an aberrant response to magnesium, whereby its rate of relaxation was lower by a factor of 5 in the presence of 5 mm magnesium plus 0.1 mNaCl compared with 0.1 m NaCl alone. The Y72A mutation slowed the rate of DNA relaxation in the presence of 0.1 mNaCl by a factor of 8 (compared with the WT rate), and the combination of NaCl and magnesium nearly abolished DNA relaxation by Y72A. Here, we analyzed the kinetics of DNA relaxation by the Y70A/Y72A double mutant under the same nonstringent conditions (no salt or magnesium) and enzyme concentration used to detect relaxation by Topo-(81–314). We found that the topoisomerase activity of Y70A/Y72A was comparable to that of Topo-(81–314) with respect to rate and the accumulation of partially relaxed topoisomers (Fig.9). Y70A/Y72A also displayed the same profound inhibition of relaxation by 100 mm NaCl or 5 mm MgCl2 that was observed for Topo-(81–314) (Fig. 9). Y70A/Y72A formed a covalent intermediate with the 18-mer/30-mer CCCTT-containing DNA under nonstringent conditions; however, the rate of single turnover cleavage was extremely slow (k cl = 3.6 × 10−5s−1) (data not shown). The cleavage rate decrement elicited by the double-alanine replacement was nearly identical to that caused by removal of the entire N-terminal domain. The sensitivity of covalent adduct formation by Y70A/Y72A to inhibition by salt and magnesium paralleled that of Topo-(81–314) (Fig. 6). The results presented in this study of vaccinia topoisomerase enhance our understanding of the eukaryotic type IB enzyme family as follows. (i) They define a catalytically active domain that is conserved between the cellular and poxvirus enzymes; (ii) they illuminate a clear distinction between structural elements required for transesterification chemistry in general and those required specifically for the cleavage reaction; (iii) they demonstrate that the catalytic domain per se is capable of recognizing the target sequence for transesterification. The 234-amino acid catalytic domain, Topo-(81–314), performed the same repertoire of reactions as the full-sized vaccinia topoisomerase: relaxation of supercoiled DNA, site-specific DNA transesterification, and DNA strand transfer. Our attempts to isolate a more extensively truncated, enzymatically active N-terminal deletion mutant of vaccinia topoisomerase were unsuccessful. 2C. Cheng, unpublished data. Therefore, we suggest that the vaccinia catalytic domain defines (for now) the minimum functional unit of a type IB topoisomerase. The catalytic domain includes the active site Tyr-274 and the four other conserved residues (Arg-130, Lys-167, Arg-223, and His-265) that we have shown are essential for transesterification reaction chemistry. Essential residues are defined as those at which side chain removal causes at least a 10−2 rate decrement in single-turnover religation. We regard mutational effects on the rate of the religation reaction as the simplest measure of the contribution of any protein moiety to reaction chemistry. This is because single-turnover religation entails no site-recognition step, i.e. the topoisomerase is already bound covalently to the DNA. Although loss of the N terminus is not without consequences, it appears that the N-terminal domain is not directly involved in covalent catalysis, i.e. the rate of religation by Topo-(81–314) was similar to that of WT topoisomerase. Note that, because the rate of DNA religation to the 18-mer acceptor oligonucleotide is too fast to measure accurately by manual assay methods (k rel = 1.3 s−1), we can only construe from the finding that the reactions were complete at 10 s that the rate of transesterification by Topo-(81–314) was within a factor of 10 of the WT rate. These results indicate that the N-terminal domain is nonessential for transesterification chemistry. Previously, we had mutated 22 individual residues of the 80-amino acid N-terminal domain to alanine and found that none of these single substitutions had a significant effect on transesterification rate (14Petersen B.Ø. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3891-3896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar,16Wang L.K. Wittschieben J. Shuman S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7944-7950Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 18Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids. Res. 1997; 25: 3649-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The severe and biased effects of deleting the N-terminal domain on the rate of the forward cleavage reaction suggest that a post-binding, pre-chemical step applies during the cleavage reaction, which is not pertinent during religation. Although the precise nature of the pre-cleavage step remains unclear, the available evidence that residues within the N-terminal domain make major groove contacts with the CCCTT target site (9Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3448-3457Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) suggests a post-binding alteration of the protein-DNA interface. Elimination of the two tyrosine side chains responsible for these major groove interactions (Tyr-70 and Tyr-72) elicits the same effects on relaxation and cleavage as does removal of the entire N-terminal domain. We propose that major groove contacts made by the two tyrosines induce a conformational change in the catalytic domain that activates the cleavage step. The hinge segment of the catalytic domain is a likely mediator of this proposed conformational step. The hinge is highly susceptible to proteolysis when topoisomerase is free in solution and becomes protected from proteolysis when the enzyme is bound to DNA (8Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11636-11645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Residues adjacent to the hinge become more accessible to proteolysis in the DNA-bound state (8Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11636-11645Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The alteration in the protease sensitivity of the hinge occurs prior to transesterification. Moreover, single alanine substitutions at residues Gly-132 and Tyr-136 within the hinge cause a reduction by more than 2 orders of magnitude in the rate of DNA cleavage, but only a modest effect on religation (17Wittschieben J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3001-3008Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). These effects are strikingly similar to those reported here for deletion of the N terminus. We speculate that N-terminal domain and hinge dynamics may activate cleavage by properly orienting the catalytically essential residues with respect to the scissile phosphate. The scissile phosphate and six other phosphates that contact the topoisomerase are located on the minor groove of the CCCTT target site (7Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 31731-31734Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our observation that the catalytic domain retains specificity for cleavage at CCCTT implies that vaccinia topoisomerase (i) interacts with the bases in the minor groove, (ii) senses the target site through indirect readout of backbone conformation, or (iii) recognizes the major groove through contacts intrinsic to the catalytic domainper se. Loss of contacts made by the N-terminal domain resulted in decreased affinity for the target site, which was manifest by salt and magnesium inhibition of single-turnover cleavage and DNA relaxation by Topo-(81–314). The salt and magnesium inhibition curves were essentially identical for Topo-(81–314) and Y70A/Y72A. We surmise that the two tyrosine side chains are largely responsible for the contribution made by the N-terminal domain to target site affinity. Studies of the effects of conservative replacement for Tyr-70 or Tyr-72 point to the aromatic character of these side chains as being important for enhancing DNA binding (18Sekiguchi J. Shuman S. Nucleic Acids. Res. 1997; 25: 3649-3656Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The present findings suggest that the distinctive target site specificities of the poxvirus and cellular type IB topoisomerases are not simply a function of structural differences between the domains N-terminal to the conserved catalytic core (20Sharma A. Hanai R. Mondragon A. Structure. 1994; 2: 767-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 21Lue N. Sharma A. Mondragon A. Wang J.C. Structure. 1995; 3: 1315-1322Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For the vaccinia enzyme, the specificity of cleavage is an intrinsic property of the core domain. This may also be the case for the cellular enzyme, to the extent that a core domain has been defined. Stewart et al.(28Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 355-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) have shown that active human topoisomerase can be reconstituted from a 58-kDa fragment derived from the central portion of the protein (this fragment contains all the residues of the vaccinia enzyme essential for transesterification except the active site tyrosine) plus a C-terminal 6.3-kDa fragment that includes the active site tyrosine. The fragment-reconstituted human enzyme cleaved DNA with the same sequence specificity as the full-sized protein. However, the cleavage-religation equilibrium of the reconstituted enzyme was skewed toward religation, DNA binding affinity was reduced, and the enzyme relaxed distributively (28Stewart L. Ireton G.C. Champoux J.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 355-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). These properties of fragment-reconstituted human topoisomerase I vis à vis the intact enzyme are broadly similar to what we observe for the vaccinia catalytic domain. Nonetheless, the reconstituted human fragments together are still more than twice the size of the catalytic domain of the vaccinia enzyme. Although mutational analysis of the vaccinia topoisomerase has implicated individual amino acid residues in general transesterification chemistry, in the cleavage reaction specifically, and in noncovalent DNA binding, a complete interpretation of these results will ultimately hinge on the availability of a crystal structure of the enzyme in both the free and DNA-bound states. Efforts in this and other laboratories to crystallize the full-sized vaccinia topoisomerase have been unsuccessful. We suspect this is due to flexibility of the protein at the interdomain bridge and hinge segments. We recently achieved success in crystallizing the catalytically active domain characterized in this paper.2The structure of the domain is under refinement and will be reported separately."

Incubation of cardiac myocytes for 24 h with 4 ng/ml interleukin-1β and 100 units/ml interferon-γ stimulated an increase in nitric oxide production, inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA, and iNOS protein. Mechanical strain suppressed nitric oxide production, iNOS mRNA, and iNOS protein stimulated by cytokines in an amplitude-dependent manner. Losartan (1 μm), an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, weakly inhibited the effect of strain, suggesting that paracrine angiotensin II is not the mediator of the strain effect. In addition, cycloheximide (10 μm), a protein synthesis inhibitor, inhibited the effect of strain by 46%. Transforming growth factor-β (1 ng/ml) suppressed iNOS mRNA expression, but anti-transforming growth factor-β antibody (30 μg/ml) did not block the effect of strain. In contrast, staurosporine (100 nm; a nonselective protein kinase inhibitor), calphostin C (1 μm; a selective protein kinase C inhibitor), and pretreatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate abolished the effect of strain. Genistein (100 μm), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, partially inhibited the effect of strain. Thus, cyclic mechanical deformation suppresses cytokine-induced iNOS expression in cardiac myocytes, and this effect is mediated at least partially via activation of protein kinase C.

Three genes encode nitric-oxide synthase of two biochemical types. Type I neuronal and type III endothelial nitric-oxide synthases are constitutive but dormant until activated briefly by Ca2+ transients that sustain the binding of calmodulin. A third NOS, inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS, or type II nitric-oxide synthase), is expressed only after transcriptional induction (5Xie Q.W. Cho H.J. Calaycay J. Mumford R.A. Swiderek K.M.

In cardiac myocytes, mechanical strain induces hypertrophy through activation of the phosphorylation cascade of protein kinases including protein kinase C, Raf-1 kinase, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and the stress-activated protein kinases, followed by increases in specific gene expression and protein synthesis (15Komuro I.

However, it remains unknown whether mechanical strain modulates NO synthesis in cardiac myocytes. Using a mechanical deformation device that applies a highly uniform biaxial strain field over the culture substrate, we investigated the effects of mechanical strain on nitric-oxide synthase activity in cardiac myocytes. Human recombinant IL-1β and human recombinant interferon-γ (IFN-γ) were purchased from Endogen, Inc. (Boston, MA). Human transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and mouse monoclonal anti-TGF-β antibody were purchased from Genzyme Corp. (Cambridge, MA). Losartan was a gift from Merck. Fibronectin was purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Staurosporine, calphostin C, genistein, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were purchased from Calbiochem. Cycloheximide was purchased from Sigma. Acrylamide gel buffer was purchased from Bio-Rad. [α-32P]dCTP (3000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from NEN Life Science Products. NRVM from 1-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were isolated by previously described methods (30Springhorn J.P. Claycomb W.C. Biochem. J. 1989; 258: 73-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The ventricles were cut into several pieces and incubated overnight at 4 °C in a 1 mg/ml concentration of 1:300 trypsin (Life Technologies, Inc.) in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Life Technologies, Inc.). The ventricular tissue was then digested with 1 mg/ml collagenase type II (239 units/mg; Worthington) in Hanks' balanced salt solution and centrifuged twice at 50 × gto remove less dense cells such as fibroblasts. The cells were cultured at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; BioWhittaker, Inc., Walkersville, MD) containing 7% fetal calf serum (FCS; Life Technologies, Inc.), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Mechanical deformation was applied to a thin and transparent membrane on which cells were cultured, an approach that produces controlled cellular strain as well as visualization of cells. The device used in this study provides a nearly homogeneous and uniform biaxial strain profile, i.e. strains that are equal at all locations on the membrane and in all directions. This approach eliminates locations on the substrate that have very high strains (20–30%) in one direction. We have previously measured membrane strains with high-resolution video (31Cheng G.C. Briggs W.H. Gerson D.S. Libby P. Grodzinsky A.J. Gray M.L. Lee R.T. Circ. Res. 1997; 80: 28-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar); the cams used for this study gave strains of 1, 4, 9, and 14%. NRVM were plated on a fibronectin-coated (2 μg/ml) membrane dish at a density of 3,000,000 cells/dish in 13 ml of DMEM containing 7% FCS and incubated for 48 h. Approximate cell confluence was 85–90%. NRVM were then made quiescent by washing four times with 10 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution and incubating with 10 ml of DMEM containing 1% insulin/transferrin/selenium media supplement (ITS, Sigma), 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. All experiments were performed on NRVM that had been serum-starved for 24 h. Mechanical strain was then applied at a specified constant frequency and amplitude, and control dishes received no mechanical strain. The formation of nitrite was used as an indicator of NO release by NRVM. Nitrite accumulation was measured by the Griess reaction as described previously (32Simmons W.W. Closs E.I. Cunningham J.M. Smith T.W. Kelly R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11694-11702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Briefly, the medium was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove cellular debris. The nitrite content in the supernatant was measured by combining 150 μl of medium with 900 μl of Griess reagent (0.75% sulfanilamide in 0.5 n HCl and 0.075% naphthylethylenediamine dihydrochloride), and the concentration of the resultant chromophore was determined spectrometrically at 543 nm. Nitrite concentration was calculated from known concentrations of sodium nitrite within the linear range of the assay (0.5–20 μm). NRVM were lysed directly in each dish by application of 2× sample buffer containing 250 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 4% SDS, and 2% β-mercaptoethanol, and the mixture was boiled for 5 min. The lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected. Total protein concentration was measured by the Bradford method (Bio-Rad), and equal quantities of total protein were loaded on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane in 25 mmTris base (pH 8.5), 0.2 m glycine, and 20% methanol. The nitrocellulose membrane was blocked with 5% nonfat dried milk in Tris-buffered saline washing buffer containing 20 mm Tris base (pH 7.6), 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20 for 2 h. For the detection of iNOS, the membrane was incubated with 1:1000 diluted mouse monoclonal anti-iNOS antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) for 1 h at 37 °C and washed with Tris-buffered saline washing buffer for 30 min. After application of goat anti-mouse IgG coupled to peroxidase (Bio-Rad), the membrane was developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence method (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Total RNA was isolated by the guanidium thiocyanate/phenol chloroform method (33Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63087) Google Scholar). A 217-base pair rat iNOS cDNA, which was prepared by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (34Balligand J.-L. Ungureanu-Longrois D. Simmons W.W. Pimental D. Malinski T.A. Kapturczak M. Taha Z. Lowenstein C.J. Davidoff A.J. Kelly R.A. Smith T.W. Michel T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27580-27588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was radiolabeled by the random priming method with [α-32P]dCTP and the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). For Northern blotting, 15 μg of total RNA was loaded on a 1.0% formaldehyde gel (2.0 m), transferred to a nylon membrane (Stratagene), and UV-cross-linked with a UV Stratalinker (Stratagene). The probe was hybridized with QuikHyb solution (Stratagene) at 68 °C for 1 h. The washed membrane was exposed to x-ray film overnight at −80 °C. Normalization of RNA for equal loading was carried out by rehybridizing the blots with a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNA probe (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). Data are expressed as the means ± S.E. of four samples, which represented at least three separate experiments. Differences were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance combined with Sheffé's test, and p values < 0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. We first investigated the effect of the combination of IL-1β and IFN-γ on NO production by cultured cardiac myocytes. As shown in Fig. 1, treatment of NRVM with IL-1β (4 ng/ml) and IFN-γ (100 units/ml) caused a marked accumulation of nitrite in the culture medium in a time-dependent manner. However, surprisingly, this cytokine-induced nitrite accumulation in NRVM was significantly suppressed by 9% cyclic mechanical strain at 1 Hz. 9% cyclic mechanical strain by itself did not affect the basal levels of nitrite production by NRVM. We next investigated whether mechanical strain suppressed increases in iNOS protein and mRNA levels in cytokine-stimulated NRVM. The expression of iNOS protein was analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-iNOS antibody. No immunoreactive iNOS was detected in unstimulated and stretched NRVM (Fig.2). The iNOS protein band with a molecular mass of 130 kDa appeared after exposure to the combination of IL-1β and IFN-γ in a time-dependent manner, and these iNOS protein accumulations were markedly suppressed by 9% cyclic mechanical strain at 1 Hz. Furthermore, as shown in Fig.3, unstimulated and stretched NRVM expressed no detectable iNOS mRNA, whereas exposure to the combination of IL-1β and IFN-γ clearly induced iNOS mRNA accumulations in a time-dependent manner. 9% cyclic mechanical strain at 1 Hz suppressed the cytokine-stimulated increase in iNOS mRNA accumulation. In seven separate experiments, strain suppressed iNOS mRNA by 61 ± 4% (p < 0.001). In addition, when NRVM were subjected to cyclic strains of 1, 4, 9, and 14% at 1 Hz for 8 h, the effect of mechanical strain on iNOS mRNA expression was amplitude-dependent (Fig.4). In these studies, no morphologic changes in cardiac myocytes were detected following strains of 1–14%.Figure 3Dependence of iNOS mRNA expression in cytokine-stimulated NRVM on duration of mechanical strain. NRVM were plated on 2 μg/ml fibronectin in DMEM containing 7% FCS for 48 h. After serum deprivation for 24 h, myocytes were exposed to 0 or 9% cyclic mechanical strain (1 Hz) with or without IL-1β (4 ng/ml) + IFN-γ (100 units/ml) for 24 h.

Xu Y. Slayter H.S. Izumo S. Cell. 1993; 75: 977-984Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1162) Google Scholar). To explore the mechanism of the suppressive effects of mechanical strain on NO synthesis, we investigated whether the suppressive effect of cyclic mechanical strain on iNOS mRNA expression in cytokine-stimulated NRVM is angiotensin II-dependent. Cytokine-stimulated NRVM were stretched using 9% cyclic strain at 1 Hz for 8 h in the presence or absence of angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist. As shown in Fig.5, losartan (1 μm), an angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonist, weakly inhibited (11% reduction by densitometry) the suppression of iNOS mRNA expression by cyclic mechanical strain in cytokine-stimulated NRVM. Thus, it is unlikely that angiotensin II mediates the suppressive effect of cyclic mechanical strain on iNOS mRNA expression in cytokine-stimulated NRVM. Mechanical strain may induce many proteins including growth factors, vasoconstrictors, and other unknown proteins in cardiac myocytes. We studied whether new synthesis of secondary proteins that were secreted from cardiac myocytes by mechanical strain suppressed iNOS mRNA expression in cytokine-stimulated NRVM. Addition of cycloheximide (10 μm), a protein synthesis inhibitor, for 8 h slightly suppressed iNOS mRNA in cytokine-stimulated NRVM (Fig. 6). However, cycloheximide modestly inhibited (46%) the effect of 9% cyclic mechanical strain. This experiment supported the premise that cyclic mechanical strain directly suppresses iNOS mRNA expression without new protein synthesis. TGF-β, released by cardiac myocytes and acting in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner, may participate in myocardial remodeling by hypertrophic stimuli (35Takahashi N. Calderone A. Izzo Jr., N.J.

We investigated whether TGF-β is involved in the suppressive effect of mechanical strain in cytokine-stimulated NRVM using TGF-β and anti-TGF-β antibody. As shown in Fig.7, addition of TGF-β (1 ng/ml) for 8 h suppressed iNOS mRNA expression in cytokine-stimulated NRVM. In addition, anti-TGF-β antibody (30 μg/ml) slightly augmented iNOS mRNA expression and did not abolish the suppressive effect of 9% cyclic mechanical strain (1 Hz) on iNOS mRNA expression in cytokine-stimulated NRVM (5% inhibition). Neither TGF-β nor anti-TGF-β antibody by themselves induced iNOS mRNA expression in NRVM. This experiment suggests that TGF-β secreted from cardiac myocytes does not play an important role in the suppressive effect of mechanical strain on iNOS mRNA expression. To examine the role of protein kinase C and tyrosine kinases in the suppression of iNOS mRNA expression by mechanical strain, we tested the effect of protein kinase C and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (15Komuro I.

As shown in Fig. 8, addition of staurosporine (100 nm; 100% inhibition), a nonselective protein kinase inhibitor, and calphostin C (1 μm; 98% inhibition), a selective protein kinase C inhibitor, for 8 h completely abolished the suppressive effect of 9% cyclic mechanical strain on iNOS mRNA in cytokine-stimulated NRVM. Genistein (100 μm), a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, partially inhibited (30% inhibition) the effect of strain. These inhibitors by themselves did not induce iNOS mRNA in NRVM. In addition, protein kinase C depletion by pretreatment with PMA (1 μm) for 24 h inhibited the suppressive effect of strain by 92% (Fig.9). Thus, the suppressive effect of cyclic mechanical strain is mediated at least partially via activation of protein kinase C.Figure 9Effects of pretreatment with PMA on suppression of iNOS mRNA expression by mechanical strain. NRVM were plated on 2 μg/ml fibronectin in DMEM containing 7% FCS for 48 h. After serum deprivation and pretreatment with or without PMA (1 μm) for 24 h, myocytes were exposed for 8 h to 0 or 9% cyclic mechanical strain (1 Hz) with or without IL-1β (4 ng/ml) + IFN-γ (100 units/ml).

In bovine aortic endothelial cells, cyclic mechanical strain augments endothelial NOS expression and NO production (28Awolesi M.A. Sessa W.C. Sumpio B.E. J. Clin.

In the present study, mechanical strain did not induce NO production and iNOS expression in cardiac myocytes, whereas mechanical strain suppressed NO production and iNOS expression in cytokine-stimulated myocytes. These findings suggest that mechanical strain may play an important role in iNOS expression in immunological and inflammatory conditions, including post-cardiac transplantation, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Although cardiac mechanical overload is known to alter the expression of several cardiac-specific genes, it has not yet been established whether deformation acts directly or via local paracrine and autocrine factors liberated in response to hemodynamic load. In particular, the local renin-angiotensin system may play an important role in the adaptation of the heart to pressure and volume overload (39Lindpaintner K. Ganten D. Circ.

Angiotensin II secreted from cardiac myocytes is an important mediator of the strain-induced hypertrophic response, but factors other than angiotensin II may be involved in cardiac hypertrophy induced by mechanical strain (23Sadoshima J.

In the present study, losartan weakly inhibited the suppressive effect of mechanical strain on iNOS mRNA expression in cytokine-stimulated cardiac myocytes.

In the present study, anti-TGF-β antibody did not alter the suppressive effect of mechanical strain on iNOS mRNA expression in cytokine-stimulated cardiac myocytes. It is therefore unlikely that TGF-β is the initial mediator for the suppressive effects of mechanical strain on iNOS mRNA expression. Furthermore, cycloheximide partially inhibited the effect of mechanical strain. These findings suggest that mechanical strain directly acts on iNOS gene expression in cardiac myocytes without new paracrine protein synthesis. Protein kinase C pathways activated by mechanical strain play important roles in hypertrophy and gene expression in cardiac myocytes (19Sadoshima J. Izumo S.

In the present study, protein kinase C inhibitors and pretreatment with PMA abolished the suppressive effect of mechanical strain on iNOS expression in cytokine-stimulated cardiac myocytes, suggesting that this effect is mediated at least partially via activation of protein kinase C. In conclusion, cyclic mechanical strain suppresses cytokine-induced iNOS expression in cardiac myocytes, at least partially via activation of protein kinase C. This mechanism may play a role in the pathophysiology of myocardial infarction, post-cardiac transplantation, cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, and congestive heart failure. In addition, these data demonstrate that mechanical stimuli are potent regulators of the molecular response of myocytes to cytokines."

Binding of histone H1 to the oligonucleosome complexes, under the stoichiometric binding conditions used, had no inhibitory effect on the transcriptional potential of these complexes. For almost a decade an important research effort has been made in several laboratories, including ours, trying to reconstitute chromatin fibers upon addition of purified H1 to homogenous oligonucleosome fibers (1Meersseman G. Pennings S. Bradbury E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The reconstitution of homogenous oligonucleosomal fibers onto a synthetic DNA template, consisting of a defined number of tandemly arranged fragments of the 5 S rRNA gene from the sea urchinLytechinus variegatus (2Simpson R.T. Thoma F. Brubaker J.M. Cell. 1985; 42: 799-808Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) was put forward as a promising system with high expectations for the structural characterization of the chromatin fiber. Although the system has proven to be beneficial for the structural characterization of the chromatin fiber in the absence of histone H1 linker histone (3Hansen J.C. Ausió J. Stanik V. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9129-9136Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 4Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausió J. J. Biol.

Pennings S. Bradbury E.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 220: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In fact, no evidence has been provided to show that addition of H1 to the oligonucleosome complexes, reconstituted onto the tandemly arranged 5 S rRNA gene fragments, results in a folding of a fiber resembling that of native chromatin structures. Indeed, the major structural role of the linker histones in chromatin is to increase the extent of compaction (folding) of the polynucleosomal fiber upon what appears to be a rather labile binding (5Renz M. Nehls P. Hozier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 1879-1883Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 6Thoma F. Koller T. Klug A. J.

Recent linker-histone knockout experiments carried out inTetrahymena have provided in vivo support for the structural role of histone H1 (9Shen X. Yu L. Weir J.W. Gorovsky M.A. Cell. 1995; 82: 47Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar) (see also Ausió (10Ausió J. Chemtracts. 1996; 6: 117-122Google Scholar)). The binding of linker histones to DNA in the chromatin fiber complex is weak compared with that of core histones. Linker histones can be removed from chromatin at lower ionic strengths than any of the core histones (11Burton D.R. Butler M.J. Hyde J.E. Philips D. Skidmore C.J. Walker I.O. Nucleic Acids Res. 1978; 5: 3643-3663Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) and they can easily move to occupy different positions even at relatively low salt concentrations (12Caron F. Thomas J.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 146: 513-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). The presence of more than one binding position for the linker histones to nucleosomal DNA had been long proposed (13Nelson P.P. Albright S.C. Wiseman J.M. Garrard W.T. J. Biol.

In recent years, characterization of the interaction of linker histones with a nucleosome reconstituted onto a single fragment of the Xenopus borealis 5 S rRNA gene has provided evidence for asymmetrical binding (off-axis location) (15Pruss D. Bartholomew B. Persinger J. Hayes J. Arents G. Moudrianakis E.N. Wolffe A.P. Science. 1996; 274: 614-617Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) of these histones in this reconstituted nucleosome particle (15Pruss D. Bartholomew B. Persinger J. Hayes J. Arents G.

A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Such binding is in contrast to earlier symmetrical (on-axis) models in which the folded domain of histone H1 is positioned on the dyad axis of the nucleosome, symmetrically binding to the flanking exiting and entering duplexes of DNA (17Allan J. Hartman P.G. Crane-Robinson C. Avilés F.X. Nature. 1980; 288: 675-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (517) Google Scholar, 18Staynov D.Z. Crane-Robinson C.

In both instances, binding of H1 confers an extra 20-bp 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); TBE, Tris-borate-EDTA. 1The abbreviations used are: bp, base pair(s); TBE, Tris-borate-EDTA.

EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3685-3691Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and asymmetrical in the other (16Hayes J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The experimental support in favor of these different binding models, including an alternative one which has also been recently proposed (19Travers A.A. Muyldermans S.V. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 257: 486-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), has stirred controversy on the issue of linker histone binding in chromatin (20Crane-Robinson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 75-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). We initially thought that the asymmetry of binding of histone H1 to the nucleosomes reconstituted onto the X. borealis 5 S rRNA gene could perhaps account for the apparent inability of this histone to fold the oligonucleosome fibers that had been reconstituted from tandemly repeated 5 S rRNA fragments of the sea urchin gene. In this report we show that histone H1 from HeLa cells can induce the folding of an oligonucleosome complex reconstituted from HeLa core histones and a DNA template consisting of 12 tandemly arranged 208 bp fragments of the 5 S rRNA gene of the sea urchin L. variegatus. DNA templates (208-12) consisting of 12 tandemly arranged 208-bp fragments of the 5 S rRNA gene of the sea urchin L. variegatus (2Simpson R.T. Thoma F. Brubaker J.M.

Oligonucleosome complexes were reconstituted onto the 208-12 DNA template by salt-gradient dialysis (40Tatchell K. van Holde K.E. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5295-5303Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) as described by Garcia-Ramirezet al. (4Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausió J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19587-19595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with the modifications that will be described next. Two different methods of reconstitution were used. Salt-gradient dialysis and direct mixing. During the course of the oligonucleosome reconstitution by salt gradient dialysis (see previous section) the dialysis was stopped at 0.5 m NaCl. At this point the dialysis bag was opened and its contents were concentrated 5-fold (from ∼50 to ∼250 μg/ml) using a Centricon 100 concentrator device (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA). The concentrate thus obtained was diluted with 3 volumes of 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, and was concentrated (3-fold) again using a Centricon 100 unit. This step was repeated once more, and the concentrate solution thus obtained was diluted back (5-fold) to its original volume using the same 0.5m NaCl buffer. The purpose of these 0.5 m NaCl washes is to remove any extra core histones that are not part of the nucleosome complexes but which might be weakly associated with them (23Ausió J. Seger D. Eisenberg H. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 176: 77-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). At this point the sample was equally divided in two aliquots. Histone H1 prepared from HeLa cells following the method described by Garcia-Ramirez et al. (24Garcia-Ramirez M. Leuba S.H. Ausió J. Protein Expr. Purif. 1990; 1: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) was added to one of them at a ratio of approximately 0.9–1.0 mol of histone H1/mol of 208-bp DNA fragment. Histone H1 dissolved in 0.5 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, at a concentration of 1 mg/ml was used. An extinction coefficient of A2600.1% = 2.0 was used to determine the concentration of histone H1 (25Rocchini C. Zhang F. Ausió J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 15704-15712Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). An equal volume of the 0.5 m NaCl buffer (but without H1) was added to the second aliquot, and the two samples thus obtained were dialyzed next against 0.3 m NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mmEDTA, pH 7.5, for 3 h at 4 °C. The samples were finally dialyzed overnight at 4 °C against 10 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. Two batches of oligonucleosome (208-12) complexes were prepared by gradient dialysis (4Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausió J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19587-19595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) to a final NaCl concentration of either 20 mm NaCl or 80 mmNaCl in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5, buffer. Histone H1 in the corresponding buffer was then added by direct mixing (while vortexing) to each of these samples. The ratio of histone H1 per nucleosome was kept the same as in the preceding section. The complexes thus obtained were then loaded onto (5–20%) sucrose gradients (26Ausió J. Sasi R. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1981-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) in the corresponding buffers. The fractions containing the reconstituted chromatin fractions were then pooled together and dialyzed overnight against 10 mm NaCl, 10 mmTris-HCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out in a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge using an aluminum An-55 rotor and double sector aluminum-filled Epon centerpieces. All runs were routinely performed at 26,000 rpm and 20 °C. The boundaries were analyzed according to the method of van Holde and Weischet (27van Holde K.E. Weischet W.O. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1387-1403Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar) using an XL-A Ultra Scan-Origin Version 2.93 sedimentation data analysis software (B. Demeler, Missoula, MT). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were performed also in a Beckman XL-A ultracentrifuge using a titanium An-60 Ti rotor and double sector aluminum-filled Epon centerpieces. Equilibrium runs were carried out at 2400 rpm, 20 °C. Data were evaluated using a nonlinear least-squares curve-fitting algorithm (28Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar) contained in the XL-A data analysis software using an ideal one-component model. The partial specific volumes of the different histone-DNA complexes analyzed in this work were calculated as described elsewhere (29Ausió J. Dong F. van Holde K.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 451-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). The partial specific volume values used for DNA, the histone octamer, and histone H1 in the calculations were 0.535, 0.753, and 0.777 cm3/g, respectively (30Eisenberg H. Biological Macromolecules and Polyelectrolytes in Solution. Clarendon Press, Oxford1976Google Scholar, 31Eickbush T.H. Moudrianakis E.N. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4955-4964Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 32Ausió J. Subirana J.A. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 5910-5918Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The molecular weight of the histone octamer (M r 108,768) (33DeLange R.J. Fasman G. 3rd Ed. Handbook of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. II. CRC Press, Cleveland, OH1976: 294Google Scholar) and the molecular weight average of histone H1 (M r 22,000). The partial specific volumes determined in this way were estimated to be 0.631 cm3/g and 0.640cm3/g for the 208-12 reconstituted oligonucleosome complex in the absence or in the presence of ∼1.0 mol of histone H1 per mol of nucleosome, respectively. The solubility of the reconstituted oligonucleosome complexes in the presence of MgCl2 was determined as described elsewhere (26Ausió J. Sasi R. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1981-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 34Moore S. Iskandar M. Ausió J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 230: 136-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Nucleosome core particles and chromatosomes reconstituted on the 208-12 fragment were adjusted to 1 mm CaCl2 and digested with micrococcal nuclease. The time of digestion and the amount of micrococcal nuclease was established from the previous time course of digestion analysis carried out under the same conditions. Digestion was stopped and the DNA deproteinized by adjusting the solution to 5 mm EDTA, 0.25% SDS, and phenol/chloroform extracting. The DNA was precipitated and end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and polynucleotide kinase (35Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 10.60Google Scholar). The approximately 145-bp (nucleosome core particle) and 165-bp (chromatosome) micrococcal nuclease-resistant DNA fragments were isolated by gel electrophoresis on a 4% acrylamide gel (36Yager T. van Holde K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4212-4222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). After extraction from the acrylamide matrix, the DNA was precipitated and cut with 5 units of restriction enzyme in 20 μl of appropriate restriction buffer for 4 h at 37 °C. Following this, the digested fragments were phenol/chloroform-extracted, ethanol-precipitated, and resuspended in 95% formamide, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol, and 1 mm EDTA. The fragments were denatured at 90 °C for 2 min and resolved on a 8% acrylamide gel (19:1 acrylamide:bisacrylamide) containing 8.3m urea and 1× TBE. The HeLa nuclear transcription extracts were purchased from Promega, and the transcriptions were performed per the manufacturer's instructions using 470 ng of 208-12 template (either reconstituted into nucleosome core particles/chromatosomes or as uncomplexed DNA). The buffer composition of the extracts in which the transcription reactions were carried out was 44 mm KCl, 9.1% glycerol, 0.088 mm EDTA, and 0.22 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm MgCl2, 0.4 mm NTPs, 7.4 mm HEPES, 2.9 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8. The extracts were supplemented with 150 nm recombinantXenopus TFIIIA. For each transcription reaction, 500 ng ofXenopus laevis oocyte 5 S rRNA gene DNA was included as an internal control. As it has been mentioned in the introduction, one of the most critical criterion to assess the proper binding of histone H1 to chromatin is its ability to compact the polynucleosomal fiber upon binding. The analytical ultracentrifuge provides one of the most sensitive methods to monitor compaction of the chromatin fiber. Fig.1 A shows the salt-dependent hydrodynamic behavior of 208-12 oligonucleosome complexes in the presence or absence of histone H1, as monitored by analytical ultracentrifugation. As it can be seen there,in vitro reconstitution of native-like stoichiometric amounts of histone H1 by salt gradient dialysis produces chromatin fibers which follow the salt dependent pattern of folding (as envisaged from the increase in sedimentation coefficient) expected for native chromatin fibers of an equivalent DNA length. The stoichiometry of histone H1 per nucleosome was determined by sedimentation equilibrium (4Garcia-Ramirez M. Dong F. Ausió J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19587-19595Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the molecular weight of the reconstituted complex containing H1 and of the H1 lacking complex which were reconstituted under identical conditions. A ratio of approximately 1–1.1 histone H1 molecules per nucleosome was determined in this way. As seen in Fig. 2 A this corresponds to the amounts which are present in native chromatin as assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The folding of the chromatin fibers reconstituted by salt gradient dialysis is in contrast with the low folding inability (lack of salt-dependent sedimentation coefficient increase) exhibited by the fibers reconstituted by direct mixing in either low (20 mm NaCl) or high (80 mm NaCl) salt (see Fig. 1 A). Fig. 1 B shows the Mg2+ solubility of the salt gradient dialysis reconstituted chromatin complexes lacking or containing H1. The midpoint of the solubility transitions (point at which 50% of chromatin remains still soluble) was found to be 3.4 mm for the H1-containing complexes and 4.6 for the H1-lacking complexes. The decrease in Mg2+ solubility upon binding of H1 is comparable to that observed for native chicken erythrocyte chromatin (26Ausió J. Sasi R. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1981-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It reflects the interactions of histone H1 with the linker regions connecting adjacent nucleosomes (26Ausió J. Sasi R. Fasman G.D. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1981-1988Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The interactions of Mg2+ with oligonucleosomes leading to aggregation and precipitation of the complexes have been characterized thoroughly (37Schwarz P.M. Hansen J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16284-16289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Schwarz P.M. Felthauser A. Fletcher T.M. Hansen J.C. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4009-4015Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). When digested with micrococcal nuclease, nucleosome core particles protect approximately 145 bp of DNA, while the incorporation of histone H1 increases this protection by 20 bp (39Simpson R.T. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5524-5531Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). In this study, the positions of nucleosome core particles and chromatosomes on the 208-12 DNA fragment were mapped by restriction digestion of these micrococcal nuclease resistant fragments. In Fig.2 B, lanes 1 and 2 show the 145-bp (nucleosome core particle) and 165-bp (chromatosome) micrococcal nuclease-resistant fragments, respectively, intentionally overloaded to demonstrate that there were no internal nicks within these fragments.Lane 4 shows the products of the DraI restriction digestion of the 145-bp core particle fragment. This lane shows two bands of 57 and 88 bp, indicating that the nucleosome core particle adopts primarily one position on the individual 208 subunits. Cleavage of these two fragments with MspI (lane 5) had no effect on the 57-bp fragment, but the 88-bp band was cut to yield a 28-bp band, indicating that this fragment originated from of the 3′ end of the micrococcal nuclease resistant fragment. Fig.3 schematically represents the position of the nucleosome core particles on the 208 subunits determined from this analysis. It was determined that the position of the core particles on the 208-12 DNA fragment was from −84 to +61 bp with respect to the transcriptional start site (+6 to +151 with respect to the 208 sequence). When the 165-bp fragment underwent a similar treatment, three “pairs” of bands were observed. The most predominant pair of 88 and 77 bp (representing approximately 60%) is indicative of the “asymmetrical protection” of DNA (see Fig.3 B) seen by Hayes and Wolffe (16Hayes J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A second pair of bands with sizes 96 and 69 bp suggest an almost symmetrical protection by histone H1 (Fig. 3 C). Finally, DraI restriction fragments of approximately 125 bp, which were cleaved byMspI, suggest a third chromatosome position that does not overlap the original core position (Fig. 3 D). This implies that the incorporation of histone H1 caused in some instances, the histone octamer to adopt a new position on the 208 fragment. DNase I footprinting analysis (data not shown) did not reveal any major differences between the individual nucleosomes of the H1 lacking or the H1 containing 208-12 oligonucleosome complexes. This result is consistent with a predominantly “asymmetric protection” of nucleosome DNA in the H1 containing complexes (16Hayes J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). The same 208-12 DNA oligonucleosomes containing or lacking H1 that had been used for the ultracentrifuge analysis, were transcribed in HeLa cells extracts to determine the possible effects of histone H1 on transcription. No free DNA template was present in these samples. It is important to note in this context that during the construction of the 208-12 fragment, the termination site of the 5 S rRNA gene was removed. Due to this, transcription of 208-12 yields a “ladder” of transcripts resulting from run-on transcription initiating at the many different transcriptional start sites. This can be seen in Fig.4, lanes 3 and 7, which show the products generated by transcription of naked 208-12 DNA.Lanes 2, 4, and 5 contain a 120-nucleotide band due to the inclusion of the X. laevisoocyte 5 S rRNA gene as an internal control (shown by itself inlane 2). The products generated by transcription of the 208-12 DNA after reconstitution into nucleosome core particles are shown in lane 4. As can be seen, the presence of nucleosomes on the 208-12 DNA significantly reduces the levels of transcription, but does not prevent transcription initiation. Furthermore, the size of the transcripts produced demonstrates RNA polymerase III is capable of transcription elongation through the nucleosome core particle arrays. Finally, lane 5 shows that the addition of histone H1 to the nucleosome arrays does not effect the amount or lengths of transcripts produced as the overall extent of transcription upon addition of H1 is almost indistinguishable from that of H1 depleted oligonucleosomes (Fig. 4, compare lanes 4 and 5). We have been able to reconstitute H1 onto synthetic oligonucleosome templates to produce chromatin-like fibers which exhibit a very similar salt dependent folding to that of chromatin fragments obtained by micrococcal nuclease treatment of native chromatin (Fig. 1 A) (41Butler P.J.G. Thomas J.O. J. Mol. Biol. 1980; 140: 505-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 42Butler P.J.G. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1983; 15: 57-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 43Butler P.J.G. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2599-2604Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 44Ausió J. Borochov N. Seger D. Eisenberg H. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 373-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In the reconstitution method used, histone H1 is added to the oligonucleosome templates at 0.5m NaCl, and the mixture is dialyzed down to lower salt concentrations. Presumably the reason why reconstitution works under these conditions is because nucleosomes in 0.5–0.6 m NaCl are in an equilibrium situation in which the histone octamer can freely and reversibly disassociate and associate with the DNA template (23Ausió J. Seger D. Eisenberg H. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 176: 77-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar,36Yager T. van Holde K.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 4212-4222Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 45Stein A. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 130: 103-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) and thus it can slide to accommodate for the proper binding of histone H1. These ionic strength conditions may thus represent a thermodynamically favorable situation similar to that which can be achieved under more physiological conditions using ATP dependent chaperone molecules (46Tsukiyama T. Becker P.B. Wu C. Nature. 1994; 367: 525-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 47Armstrong J.A. Emerson B.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 5634-5644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48Pazin M.J.

Cell. 1995; 83: 1011-1020Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (509) Google Scholar, 50Varga-Weisz P.D. Blank T.A. Becker P.B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2209-2216Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). Direct mixing of histone H1 at much lower ionic strengths under conditions in which histone H1 is highly mobile (80 mm NaCl) or not (20 mm NaCl) do not produce a proper reconstitution (see Fig. 1 A). Positioning analysis of the nucleosomes upon H1 reconstitution (Fig. 2 B) indicate that indeed, at least a fraction of nucleosomes move to accommodate the incorporation of H1. The same analysis shows that the oligonucleosome folding or compaction induced by H1 occurs in the presence of a highly heterogeneous binding of this histone to the individual nucleosomes. Thus our results suggest that folding of the chromatin fiber is not critically dependent on histone H1 occupying a symmetrical position in the chromatosome. In fact most of the positioning obtained by our reconstitution method represents an asymmetrical off-axis binding of histone H1 to the nucleosome. We initially thought this to be responsible for the unsuccessful attempts in reconstituting H1 onto the 5 S rRNA gene oligonucleosome templates. Although H1 binding under our experimental conditions generates a 165 particle (Fig. 2 B), DNase I footprinting (results not shown) does not show any major distinctive protection in agreement with previous reconstitutions carried out on single copy templates of the 5 S rRNA gene (16Hayes J. Wolffe A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6415-6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). It is possible that, as hinted by Crane-Robinson (20Crane-Robinson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 75-77Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), the binding of the folded domain of histone H1 to the nucleosome results in a conformational transition of the core particle which creates two binding sites for the linker DNA. This would explain why the folding of the chromatin fiber does not seem to be much affected by either a “symmetrical” or an off-axis location of H1. After all, this may not be at all surprising. It may simply be a particular reflection of the intrinsic ability of histone H1 and histone H1-related proteins to condense DNA into 30–40-nm fibers regardless of the presence or not of nucleosomes (51Casas M.T. Ausió J. Subirana J.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 204: 192-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We also wanted to take advantage of this reconstituted system to see if it could shed some insight onto the still unresolved enigma of histone H1 and transcription (52Zlanatova J. van Holde K.E. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 889-895PubMed Google Scholar) (see Fig. 4). Special attention was paid to the MgCl2 conditions used in the reaction mixtures in order to prevent any precipitation of H1 containing oligonucleosome templates (44Ausió J. Borochov N. Seger D. Eisenberg H. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 177: 373-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 53Borochov N. Ausió J. Eisenberg H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 3089-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Under the experimental conditions used by us, the presence or absence of H1 in the reconstituted oligonucleosome complexes (Fig. 4,lanes 4 and 5) did not seem to have any major effect on the modulation of RNA polymerase III transcription. This is in contrast to the presence of nucleosomes (Fig. 4, compare lanes 3 and 4) which very significantly decreases the extent of transcription on the 208-12 DNA template as it had already been reported previously (54Hansen J.C. Wolfe A.P. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 7977-7988Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Our results are also in agreement with the results obtained with a polymerase II system which observed transcriptional repression by nucleosomes but not H1 in reconstitutedDrosophila chromatin (55Sandaltzopoulos R. Blank T. Becker P.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 373-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). However, this contradicts earlier results (56Laybourn P.J. Kadonaga J.T. Science. 1991; 254: 238-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). Further analysis in this direction, designed to clarify this seemingly contradictory results is currently carried out in our laboratory. We are very grateful to Robert T. Simpson for kindly providing us with p5S 208-12 plasmid used for the reconstitution of oligonucleosome complexes. We are also very thankful to Chris Woodcock for providing us with some helpful hints for the reconstitution of histone H1 onto the p5S 208-12 oligonucleosome templates. We also would like to thank Angie Francis and Madonna Voutier for their skillful typing of the manuscript. Finally, we thank Roderick Haesevoets for help in preparations of figures."

FEBS Lett. 1974; 42: 309-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).Previous genetic and biochemical studies have indicated that two sets of factors affect PG-P synthase activity: cross-pathway control by inositol and choline and factors affecting mitochondrial development such as carbon source, oxygen, and mutations in mitochondrial DNA (16Greenberg M.L.

Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 6124-6131Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Regulation by inositol is unique compared with its regulation of other phospholipid biosynthetic pathways in that a decrease in PG-P synthase activity is sudden and dramatic upon addition of inositol to the growth medium (16Greenberg M.L. Hubbell S. Lam C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4773-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). It was speculated that this rapid effect could not be due to repression of gene transcription but, instead, is a result of inactivation and/or degradation of the PG-P synthase. In addition, PG-P synthase activity was found not subject to regulation by the INO2-INO4-OPI1 regulatory genes which are required for cross pathway regulation by inositol (16Greenberg M.L. Hubbell S. Lam C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4773-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The PGS1 gene (also known as the PEL1 gene) encoding PG-P synthase in yeast has been isolated and characterized (3Chang S.-C. Heacock P.N. Clancey C.J. Dowhan W. J. Biol.

Grivell L.A. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1993; 46: 51-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Transcription levels of genes involved are rapidly adapted to changes in the available carbon source. Previous studies have shown there is correlation between mitochondrial development and cellular CL levels (4Gallet P.F. Petit J.-M. Maftah A. Zachowski A. Julien R. Biochem.

Yeast cells growing in a non-fermentable carbon source have higher PG-P synthase activity and a higher CL content than cells grown in glucose. Cells growing in a medium with glucose as the carbon source have two phases of growth. During the fermentative growth phase when ethanol is accumulated at the expense of glucose, CL is maintained at a lower level. After glucose is completely consumed, yeast cells begin to use ethanol as a carbon source, and CL levels almost double within a short period of time (4Gallet P.F. Petit J.-M. Maftah A. Zachowski A. Julien R. Biochem. J. 1997; 324: 627-634Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Carbon source mainly affects PG-P synthase activity, but not other enzymes in CL biosynthesis, such as PG-P phosphatase or CL synthase (17Gaynor P.M. Hubbell S. Schmidt A.J. Lina R.A. Minskoff S.A.

The amount of PG-P synthase activity relative to mitochondrial protein is kept at the same level regardless of changes in growth conditions; thus, PG-P synthase activity is regulated coordinately with the amount of mitochondria per cell (2Greenberg M.L. Lopes J.M. Microbiol. Rev. 1996; 60: 1-20Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, the DNA sequence 5′ to thePGS1 gene does not contain any consensus binding sites for regulatory factors involved in carbon source-dependent transcriptional regulation (19de Winde J.H.

The committed and rate-limiting step is catalyzed by PG-P synthase (1Carman G.M. Henry S.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 635-669Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Greenberg M.L. Lopes J.M. Microbiol.

A., and Waechter, C. J. (1985) Methods Enzymol. 111, 471–482). The Dol-P phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.51) has been solubilized by extracting pig brain microsomes with the nonionic detergent Nonidet P-40 and purified approximately 1,107-fold by a combination of anion exchange chromatography, polyethylene glycol fractionation, dye-ligand chromatography, and wheat germ agglutinin affinity chromatography. Treatment of the enzyme with neuraminidase prevented binding to wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose, indicating the presence of one or moreN-acetylneuraminyl residues per molecule of enzyme. When the highly purified polyisoprenyl phosphate phosphatase was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, a major 33-kDa polypeptide was observed. Enzymatic dephosphorylation of Dol-P by the purified phosphatase was 1) optimal at pH 7; 2) potently inhibited by F−, orthovanadate, and Zn2+ > Co2+ > Mn2+ but unaffected by Mg2+; 3) exhibited an approximate K m for C95-Dol-P of 45 μm; and 4) was sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide, phenylglyoxal, and diethylpyrocarbonate. The pig brain phosphatase did not dephosphorylate glucose 6-phosphate, mannose 6-phosphate, 5′-AMP, orp-nitrophenylphosphate, but it dephosphorylated dioleoyl-phosphatidic acid at initial rates similar to those determined for Dol-P. Based on the virtually identical sensitivity of Dol-P and phosphatidic acid dephosphorylation by the highly purified enzyme toN-ethylmaleimide, F−, phenylglyoxal, and diethylpyrocarbonate, both substrates appear to be hydrolyzed by a single enzyme with an apparent dual specificity. This is the first report of the purification of a neutral Dol-P phosphatase from mammalian tissues. Although the enzyme is Mg2+-independent and capable of dephosphorylating Dol-P and PA, several enzymological properties distinguish this lipid phosphomonoesterase from PAP2.

Recent studies on the biosynthesis of Dol-P indicate that the induction of the cis-isoprenyltransferase system, catalyzing the chain elongation stage in the de novo pathway, is a key regulatory event when the rates of lipid intermediate synthesis and proteinN-glycosylation increase developmentally in embryonic rat brain (10Crick D.C. Waechter C.J. J. Neurochem. 1994; 62: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and proliferating B lymphocytes (11Crick D.C. Scocca J.R. Rush J.S. Frank D.W. Krag S.S. Waechter C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10559-10565Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of membrane-bound enzymes capable of phosphorylating dolichol and dephosphorylating Dol-P has been documented for a number of animal tissues (12Rip J.W. Rupar C.A. Ravi K. Carroll K.K. Prog. Lipid Res. 1985; 24: 269-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Reciprocal developmental changes in dolichol kinase and polyisoprenyl phosphate phosphatase activity have been reported for sea urchin embryos (13Rossignol D.P. Scher M. Waechter C.J. Lennarz W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9122-9127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and mammalian brain (14Bhat N.R. Frank D.W. Wolf M.J. Waechter C.J. J.

The metabolic balance in the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of Dol-P could play a role in the “activation” of reserve pools of dolichol during developmental increases in protein N-glycosylation. Dol-P phosphatase (Dol-Pase) would provide a means of reducing the size of the Dol-P pool when the demand for N-linked glycoproteins decreases. The developmental pattern for Dol-Pase described for estrogen-treated chick oviducts suggested a potential role for the enzyme in Dol-P biosynthesis (16DeRosa P.A. Lucas J.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 234: 537-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Since there is evidence that dolichol is formed by the enzymatic reduction of the double bond in the α-isoprene unit of the free long chain polyprenol (17Sagami H. Kurisaki A. Ogura K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10109-10113Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), α-reduction would not occur until the fully unsaturated polyprenyl pyrophosphate intermediate was dephosphorylated by polyprenyl pyro- and monophosphatase activities. In this biosynthetic scheme, dolichol kinase would catalyze the terminal step in the de novo pathway. Previous work from this laboratory has shown that crude microsomes from calf brain catalyze the dephosphorylation of endogenous and exogenous Dol-P (18Burton W.A. Scher M.G. Waechter C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1981; 208: 409-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The brain polyisoprenyl phosphate phosphatase is enriched in light microsomes and axon plasma membranes (19Scher M.G. DeVries G.H. Waechter C.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1984; 231: 293-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). However, despite the potential importance of this class of phosphatases in the metabolism of Dol-P, the specificity and number of enzymes catalyzing the dephosphorylation reaction have not been determined. As an initial step toward the ultimate goal of cloning and sequencing polyisoprenyl phosphate phosphatase, and to learn more about its structure and specificity, we have purified the enzyme from pig brain microsomes. The brain enzyme was found to be an intrinsic membrane sialoglycoprotein, and specificity studies establish that although it is definitely not a nonspecific phosphomonoesterase, the highly purified enzyme is capable of actively dephosphorylating Dol-P and phosphatidic acid. The dual specificity of this novel membrane-bound Dol-Pase and the characteristics that distinguish it from PAP2 are discussed. Portions of this work have been presented in a preliminary report (20Frank D. Waechter C.J. FASEB J. 1990; 4 (abstr.): 1930Crossref Scopus (0) Google Scholar).

Agarose-linked lectin from the peanut Arachis hypogaea (Arachis hypogaeaagglutinin-agarose) and succinyl-WGA-agarose were obtained from EY Laboratories. Agarose-conjugated lectins from Ricinus communis (R. communis agglutinin-agarose), andVicia villosa (V. villosa agglutinin-agarose) were purchased from Sigma. [32P]Dol-P and [32P]polyprenyl phosphate were prepared as described by Adair and Keller (22Adair Jr., W.L. Keller R.K. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 111: 201-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) with an adaptation of the procedure of Danilovet al. (23Danilov L.L. Druzhinina T.N. Kalinchuk N.A. Maltsev S.D. Shibaev V.N. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1989; 51: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.5–2 mCi of [32P]H3PO4, 1 μmol of H3PO4, and 1 μmol of tetra-n-butylammonium hydroxide were dissolved in 200 μl of anhydrous CH3CN. The solvent was evaporated under a stream of nitrogen. Dissolution in dry CH3CN and evaporation was repeated twice. The resulting tetra-n-butylammonium phosphate was dissolved in 50 μl of CHCl3 containing 1 mg (∼0.8 μmol) dolichol or polyprenol and 5 μmol of trichloroacetonitrile. The reactants were mixed thoroughly with a vortex mixer and allowed to react for 30 min or longer at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 4 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) and 0.8 ml 0.9% NaCl. After 8–10 washings of the organic phase with 2 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH/0.9% NaCl (3:48:47) and once with CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O (3:48:47), the organic phase was then taken to dryness under a stream of nitrogen. The radiolabeled substrates were dissolved in 0.5 ml of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) and applied to a small column (1-ml bed volume in a Pasteur pipette) of TSK-Gel Toyopearl-DEAE 650M (acetate form) equilibrated in CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1). The column was washed with 5 ml each of CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1) and 1, 2, and 5 mm ammonium acetate in CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1). The phosphorylated alcohols eluted predominantly in the 2 mm ammonium acetate fraction and comigrated with authentic standards when subjected to thin layer chromatography on Silica Gel G 60 (Merck) developed with basic (CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O/NH4OH, 65:35:4:4), neutral (CHCl3/CH3OH/H2O, 75:25:4), and acidic (2,6-dimethyl-4-heptanone/acetic acid/H2O, 20:15:2) solvents. The method was also used to prepare [32P]phosphatidic acid fromsn-dioleoylglycerol, and the product co-migrated with authentic phosphatidic acid in the same solvents. A series of mono- and diphosphorylated dolichols and polyprenols of defined, homogeneous chain length were synthesized essentially by procedure B of the method of Danilov et al. (23Danilov L.L. Druzhinina T.N. Kalinchuk N.A. Maltsev S.D. Shibaev V.N. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 1989; 51: 191-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), using chloroform as the solvent. Phosphorylated isoprenoid alcohols were identified following thin layer chromatography by spraying the plate with a phosphate-specific spray (24Dittmer J.C. Lester R.L. J. Lipid Res. 1964; 5: 126-127Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), allowing development of color, and then spraying with the p-anisaldehyde reagent described by McSweeney (25McSweeney G.P. J. Chromatogr. 1965; 17: 183-185Crossref Google Scholar) for detection of isoprenoid compounds. Fresh pig brains were obtained from 6-month-old pigs at the time of slaughter and used immediately or stored at −70 °C. Preparation of microsomes was performed at 4 °C unless otherwise indicated. Prior to homogenization, blood vessels and the meninges were removed from the brain. In a typical preparation, 7–10 brains (∼1 kg, wet weight) were homogenized in 3 volumes of buffer A (0.1m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.25 m sucrose, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), for 1.5 min in a Waring blender. The homogenate was centrifuged at 10,000 × gfor 15 min. The resulting pellet was diluted with 3 volumes of buffer A, rehomogenized, and centrifuged as before. The 10,000 ×g supernatants were combined and centrifuged at 140,000 × g max for 1 h in a Beckman type 35 rotor. Peripheral membrane proteins were removed by resuspending the microsomes (5 mg of membrane protein/ml) in buffer A containing 1m NaCl. The suspension was stirred 1 h. The salt-washed membranes were sedimented by high speed centrifugation as above. The pellet was washed twice in 360 ml of buffer A and resuspended in buffer A at a protein concentration of 15–30 mg/ml. The membranes were stored at −20 °C. Salt-washed microsomes were resuspended in cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA and quantitatively transferred to a flask to obtain a final concentration of 2 mg of protein/ml. The flask was placed on ice, and 10% Nonidet P-40 was added to a final concentration of 1% Nonidet P-40. The mixture was stirred for 15 min, and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 140,000 × g max for 1 h. The supernatant, containing Dol-Pase activity, was retained for further fractionation. The detergent-solubilized enzyme was applied to a column of TSK-Gel Toyopearl-DEAE 650M (2.5 × 16 cm) equilibrated at 4 °C in buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride) at a flow rate of 8 ml/min. The column was washed with 2 column volumes of buffer B. Bound protein was eluted with a concave gradient of 0–0.75 m NaCl in buffer B and collected in 6-ml fractions. Eluted fractions containing Dol-Pase activity were pooled and concentrated with an Amicon ultrafiltration cell fitted with a YM100 membrane (molecular weight cut-off of ∼100 kDa). PEG (average molecular weight of 8,000) was added (150 mg of PEG/ml of protein solution) to the stirred solution in three equal portions over a 30-min period. Gentle stirring was continued for 1 h following dissolution of the PEG. The mixture was then centrifuged for 1 h at 140,000 × g max. The supernatant solution, containing Dol-Pase activity, was saved. Dol-Pase activity in the PEG supernatant was applied to a column (1 × 3 cm) of TSK-Gel Toyopearl-Blue 650M equilibrated in buffer B at 4 °C, and the column was washed with 20 ml of buffer B. Bound protein was eluted with a 50-ml linear gradient of 0–1 mNaCl in the same buffer at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Dol-Pase activity recovered from the dye column was pooled and concentrated to about 1 ml with an Amicon ultrafiltration cell fitted with a YM100 membrane then applied to WGA-Sepharose 6MB (0.75 × 25 cm) equilibrated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40; 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.15 m NaCl (buffer C). The enzyme solution was allowed to flow into the column bed under gravity, with a pressure head of 15 cm. After the sample had entered the bed, buffer C was layered over the gel, column flow was stopped, and the sample was equilibrated for 10–15 min with the lectin. The column was washed with 3 column volumes of buffer, and then bound glycoproteins were eluted with buffer C containing 0.1 m N-acetyl-d-glucosamine. Fractions collected from each step of purification were assayed for Dol-Pase activity and protein concentration. Where indicated, NaCl concentration was estimated by comparison of conductivity of eluted fractions to standard solutions. Microsomes, detergent extracts, and column fractions were assayed for Dol-Pase activity by the method of Sumbilla and Waechter (26Sumbilla C. Waechter C.J. Methods Enzymol. 1985; 111: 471-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures typically contained 50 μg of microsomal protein, 20 μg of Nonidet P-40-solubilized protein, or 5–10 μl from column fractions, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm [32P]Dol-P (500–2,000 cpm/nmol) in a total volume of 50 μl. Chemically phosphorylated dolichol from pig liver (C80–C105) was used routinely as substrate. Assays were performed at 37 °C for 5 or 10 min. The enzymatic dephosphorylation of [3H]glucose 6-phosphate, [2-3H]mannose 6-phosphate, and 5′-[3H]AMP by the purified phosphatase was assayed as described previously for mannose-6-phosphatase (27Rush J.S. Waechter C.J. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 206: 328-333Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The dephosphorylation of [3H]farnesyl phosphate was determined by analyzing an aliquot of the phosphatase reaction mixture by thin layer chromatography on Silica Gel G 60 and developing with CHCl3/CH3OH/NH4OH/H2O (65:35:4:4). The reaction products were located with a Bioscan Imaging Scanner System 200-IBM and subsequently scraped from the plate and quantitated by scintillation counting. To locate polyprenyl phosphate phosphatase activity in nondenaturing gels, individual gel lanes were sliced with a razor blade. The gel slices were macerated in a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube and incubated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 12.5 mm EDTA, and 0.2 mm [32P]Dol-P (500–1,000 cpm/nmol) in a total volume of 0.2 ml at 37 °C for 1 h with periodic mixing. A 50-μl aliquot was removed, and released 32Pi was extracted and quantitated. Denaturing gel electrophoresis was performed in SDS-polyacrylamide minigels according to Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). Gels were fixed and silver-stained (29Wray W. Boulikas T. Wray V.P. Hancock R. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 118: 197-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (2491) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis of Dol-Pase under nondenaturing conditions was performed in gradient gels of 5–20% (2.7% cross-linker) acrylamide, buffered with 0.375 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.8, 0.1% Nonidet P-40. No stacking gel was employed. The tank buffer was 25 mmTris, 0.192 m glycine, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, pH 8.3. Gels were run for 4–18 h at an initial current of 10 mA (voltage limited to 500 V) at 4 °C. Individual gel lanes were separated, and the resulting strips were used for silver staining of protein or location of Dol-Pase activity (see above). Purified Dol-Pase was subjected to solution isoelectric focusing in a Bio-Rad Rotofor apparatus. The focusing chamber contained 50 ml of 1% Pharmalyte 4–6.5 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), 2% Nonidet P-40, 15% glycerol and was prefocused for 2 h at 12 watts, 4 °C. The anolyte was 0.1 m acetic acid, and the catholyte was 0.1 mNaOH. After the pH gradient was established, Dol-Pase in 1–3 ml 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 was added. Power was applied at 12 watts for 3 h. Temperature was maintained by a recirculating ice water bath. At the end of the isoelectric focusing period, fractions were collected and analyzed for phosphatase activity and pH. Purified Dol-Pase was analyzed by lectin affinity chromatography using 0.5–1 ml of gel. The columns were equilibrated, and the sample was applied in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.15 m NaCl at room temperature and equilibrated for 10 min. The column was washed with 10 column volumes of buffer, and bound protein was eluted with the appropriate monosaccharide or disaccharide specific for the lectin. Fractions of 0.5–1 ml were collected and assayed for Dol-Pase activity. Purified Dol-Pase (25 μg in 50 μl or 105 dpm of125I-Dol-Pase prepared using Iodogen (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's instructions) was incubated with 10 milliunits ofA. ureafaciens neuraminidase or 7.5 milliunits of neuraminidase from C. perfringens at room temperature (∼24 °C) for 4 h, in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm EDTA. Treated Dol-Pase was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE or analytical lectin affinity chromatography as described elsewhere. Purified Dol-Pase (25 nmol/min of activity in 9 μl) was incubated with 0–10 mm diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC), 0–25 mm N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), or 0–25 mm phenylglyoxal for 30 min at 37 °C in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.095% Nonidet P-40, 0.95 mm EDTA in a total volume of 10 μl. Fresh stock solutions of each alkylating reagent in absolute ethanol were prepared just prior to use, and 1 μl of each reagent stock solution at the appropriate concentration was added to Dol-Pase to initiate the reaction. Following the incubation period, each reaction mixture was diluted with 40 μl of cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 0.1% (w/v) Nonidet P-40, 25 mm EDTA. In some experiments, treatment of Dol-Pase with DEPC was followed by the addition of 2 μl of 1 mNH2OH (final concentration, 170 mm). Tubes receiving NH2OH were incubated an additional 30 min at 37 °C and then diluted to 50 μl with cold buffer, as described above. After dilution of each sample to 50 μl, one-tenth of that volume was removed and assayed for Dol-Pase activity as described above. Estimations of protein concentration utilized the BCA protein assay (Pierce) essentially as described by Smith et al. (30Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18348) Google Scholar). The reference protein for all assays was bovine serum albumin. The concentration of Dol-P and other lipids in solution or dispersion was determined by the modified Bartlett procedure described by Kates (31Kates M. Laboratory Techniques in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. 3. Elsevier Science Publishers B.V., Amsterdam1986Google Scholar). Radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting in a Packard Tri-Carb liquid scintillation spectrometer. Dried samples were dissolved in 0.8 ml of 1% SDS, and 9.2 ml of liquid scintillation fluid (3a70b Complete Counting Mixture or Econo-Safe; Research Products International, Inc.) was added. All data are average values obtained by measuring the amount of radioactivity in each sample for 10 min. Solubilization trials indicated that the most efficient conditions for extraction of Dol-Pase activity from salt-washed pig brain microsomes required 1% Nonidet P-40 at a detergent/protein ratio of 5–10 mg of detergent/mg of protein (Fig.1). The yield of solubilized activity varied with different microsomal fractions and the amount of membrane protein used for the preparation. Triton X-100 was nearly as effective, but the polyisoprenyl phosphate phosphatase activity was inhibited by Brij 35, Lubrol PX, CHAPS, sodium deoxycholate, sodium taurocholate, and cetylpyridinium chloride in the same concentration range. Extraction of the enzyme with 1% Nonidet P-40 at neutral pH resulted in solubilization of 60–80% of the activity, with a slight (2–3-fold) increase in specific activity (Table I).Table IPurification of polyisoprenyl phosphate phosphatase from pig brain microsomesPurification stepEnzyme activityProtein recoveredSpecific activityYield-Fold purificationnmol/minmgnmol/mg/min%Microsomes18,2237,7882.3100NP-40 extract12,6572,0506.269.52.6Toyo-DEAE7,3379478.140.333.4PEG fractionation6,96014.149438.2211Toyo-Blue5,6454.21,34331.0574WGA-Sepharose4,3781.72,59024.01,107 Open table in a new tab When the detergent-solubilized activity was applied to a TSK-Gel Toyopearl-DEAE 650M column, Dol-Pase was completely retained and was eluted in two narrowly resolved peaks with 0.05–0.1 mNaCl, using a concave 0–0.75 m NaCl gradient (Fig.2 A). The two closely eluted peaks from the anion-exchange column could be due to differential amounts of sialyl residues in a single enzyme, since no evidence for multiple Dol-Pases was seen in the subsequent purification steps (see below). Typically, 60–70% of the phosphatase activity was recovered, resulting in a 10–12-fold purification. Dol-Pase activity in peak fractions was not stimulated by the addition of aliquots from the flow-through fraction or other included fractions, suggesting that the modest loss of activity was due to partial denaturation of the enzyme and not to separation of the enzyme from an unidentified cofactor or regulatory protein during this chromatographic step. Pooled fractions from the narrowly resolved peaks of polyisoprenyl phosphate phosphatase activity were separated from 80% or more of the other proteins by polyethylene glycol fractionation (Table I). Following high speed centrifugation, the phosphatase was found predominantly in the supernatant fraction, while the bulk of the protein was precipitated. The 15% PEG supernatant solution containing Dol-Pase was then further purified by adsorption to a column of TSK-Gel Toyopearl-Blue 650M and eluted with a gradient of 0–1 m NaCl (Fig. 2 B). The enzyme activity eluted in a single peak centered at 0.75m NaCl. Most of the applied protein was not retained by the column. The purification resulting from this chromatographic step was generally at least 3–5-fold. When the fractions from the Toyopearl-Blue column containing Dol-Pase were pooled and applied to a column of WGA-Sepharose 6MB, most of the enzyme was bound by the lectin and could be eluted as a single peak of activity with 0.1 m GlcNAc (Fig. 2 C), consistent with the presence of sialylated oligosaccharide chains. Lectin affinity chromatography produced an enzyme preparation that was purified approximately 1,107-fold relative to salt-washed brain microsomes (Table I). A small portion (5–15%) of the activity did not bind to the column, and repeated applications of the flow-through fraction resulted in only minor additional binding of Dol-Pase to the lectin. This result may indicate heterogeneity in the oligosaccharide chains. SDS-PAGE analysis of purified Dol-Pase revealed a major silver-stained polypeptide ofM r 33,000 (Fig.3 A). To confirm that the major polypeptide observed by silver staining the SDS-gel was the phosphatase assayed using Dol-P as substrate, the purified enzyme was run on a nondenaturing gel by substituting Nonidet P-40 for SDS in the Tris-glycine buffer reported by Laemmli (28Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). After allowing electrophoresis to proceed for 18 h, with constant cooling of the gel, silver staining revealed a well defined band of protein migrating 1.0–1.5 cm, which corresponds to the gel slices containing Dol-Pase activity (Fig. 3 B). The isoelectric point of Dol-Pase was examined by focusing the purified enzyme in detergent"
https://openalex.org/W2030398182,"The bifunctional leukotriene A4hydrolase catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of the proinflammatory leukotriene B4. During exposure to the substrate leukotriene A4, a labile allylic epoxide, the enzyme is gradually inactivated as a consequence of the covalent binding of leukotriene A4 to the active site. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as suicide inactivation, has previously been rationalized as a mechanism-based process in which the enzyme converts the substrate to a highly reactive intermediate within an activated enzyme-substrate complex that partitions between covalent bond formation (inactivation) and catalysis. To further explore the molecular mechanism of the self-inactivation of leukotriene A4 hydrolase by leukotriene A4, we prepared and analyzed mutated forms of the enzyme that were either catalytically incompetent or fully active but resistant toward substrate-mediated inactivation. These mutants were treated with leukotriene A4 and leukotriene A4 methyl and ethyl esters and subjected to differential peptide mapping and enzyme activity determinations, which showed that inactivation and/or covalent modification can be completely dissociated from catalysis. Our results, together with recent findings described in the literature, argue against a mechanism-based model for suicide inactivation. We conclude that the collected data on the substrate-mediated inactivation of leukotriene A4 hydrolase best conforms to an affinity-labeling mechanism.

Wetterholm A. Medina J.F. Samuelsson B. J. Lipid Mediators. 1993; 6: 1-13PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the enzyme possesses an aminopeptidase activity toward a variety of substrates including synthetic chromogenic amides (2Haeggström J.Z. Wetterholm A. Vallee B.L. Samuelsson B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), opioid peptides (3Griffin K.J. Gierse J. Krivi G. Fitzpatrick F.A. Prostaglandins. 1992; 44: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and arginyl tripeptides (4Orning L. Gierse J.K. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11269-11273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the endogenous substrate and the physiological significance of the peptidase activity are still not known.During catalysis, LTA4 hydrolase converts LTA4stereospecifically to LTB4, but a fraction of the substrate will covalently bind to the active site of the enzyme, causing irreversible inactivation of both enzyme activities (5Orning L. Jones D.A. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14911-14916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Orning L. Gierse J. Duffin K. Bild G. Krivi G. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22733-22739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This process, usually referred to as suicide inactivation, has been proposed to be rate-limiting in cellular LTB4 biosynthesis and may therefore be an important mechanism for the overall regulation of this biosynthetic pathway in vivo (7Fitzpatrick F.A. Lepley R. Orning L. Duffin K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 714: 64-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Using differential Lys-specific peptide mapping, we have recently identified a heneicosapeptide, denoted K21, encompassing the amino acid residues 365–385 of human LTA4 hydrolase, which is involved in the binding of LTA4 and LTA4 methyl and ethyl ester to the native enzyme. In experiments using LTA4 ethyl ester, it was possible to identify Tyr-378 as the residue that is involved in the binding of the lipid (8Mueller M.J. Wetterholm A. Blomster M. Jörnvall H. Samuelsson B. Haeggström J.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8383-8387Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In a recent study using site-directed mutagenesis, we could show that a conservative replacement at position 378 increased the turnover for epoxide hydrolysis and rendered the enzyme virtually resistant to suicide inactivation with LTA4 (9Mueller M.J. Blomster M. Opperman U.C.T. Jörnvall H. Samuelsson B. Haeggström J.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5931-5935Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, the function of Tyr-378 was not primarily catalytic since (Y378F/Q)LTA4 hydrolase displayed both enzyme activities. However, the hydrolysis of LTA4 catalyzed by the mutated enzymes was affected, leading to a mixture of LTB4 and 5S,12R-dihydroxy-6,10-trans-8,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid in a ratio of 1:0.2 for Y378F and 1:0.3 for Y378Q-LTA4hydrolase, suggesting that the transition state complexes formed with the mutated enzymes are less well defined as compared with that of the wild type enzyme (10Mueller M.J. Andberg M. Samuelsson B. Haeggström J.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24345-24348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar).It has been proposed that the substrate-mediated inactivation of LTA4 hydrolase by LTA4 is a mechanism-based process (Fig. 1 A), which would imply that the inactivation (i.e. covalent modification) is dependent on turnover and vice versa (5Orning L. Jones D.A. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14911-14916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Orning L. Gierse J. Duffin K. Bild G. Krivi G. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22733-22739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to test this hypothesis, we investigated the interaction of the catalytically incompetent E318A-LTA4hydrolase with LTA4 and LTA4 methyl and ethyl ester. In addition, we investigated the mutated enzymes Y378F and Y378Q-LTA4 hydrolase that are resistant toward substrate-mediated inactivation. Our results indicate that LTA4 is an affinity label rather than a mechanism-based inhibitor that modifies and blocks the active site by virtue of its binding specificity and inherent chemical reactivity.DISCUSSIONLTA4, the key precursor of the biologically active leukotrienes, is an unusual example of an endogenous compound that is both a natural substrate and an irreversible inactivator of a target enzyme, i.e. LTA4 hydrolase. Results obtained by several experimental approaches have indicated that this inactivation of LTA4 hydrolase satisfies criteria of a mechanism-based process (6Orning L. Gierse J. Duffin K. Bild G. Krivi G. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22733-22739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). Thus, after treatment of native and recombinant human LTA4 hydrolase with LTA4 or LTA4 methyl ester, the epoxide hydrolase and peptidase activities are lost simultaneously and irreversibly in a time-dependent, saturable process that is of pseudo first-order kinetics. There is a direct relationship between catalysis and inactivation with equivalent pH dependence for both processes. Active-site specificity has been demonstrated by protection with competitive inhibitors (6Orning L. Gierse J. Duffin K. Bild G. Krivi G. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22733-22739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Mueller M.J. Wetterholm A. Blomster M. Jörnvall H. Samuelsson B. Haeggström J.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8383-8387Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 15Evans J.F. Kargman S. FEBS Lett. 1992; 297: 139-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and mass spectrometric analysis has revealed that suicide inactivation occurs predominantly in a 1:1 stoichiometry between lipid and protein, with only little modification of secondary sites (6Orning L. Gierse J. Duffin K. Bild G. Krivi G. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22733-22739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From these data, substrate-mediated inactivation of LTA4 hydrolase has been classified as a mechanism-based process. However, all these criteria are also consistent with an affinity-labeling mechanism (Fig.1 B).Mechanism-based Inhibitors Versus Affinity LabelsA mechanism-based inhibitor is an unreactive molecule that is activated by the catalytic machinery of an enzyme into a reactive product which in turn will covalently modify an active-site residue. Typically, a mechanism-based inhibitor is a synthetically prepared substrate analogue that has been designed to covalently bind a catalytic acid-base of the transition state after its enzymatic transformation into a reactive species (16Fersht A. Enzyme Structure and Mechanism. W. H. Freeman and Co., New York1984: 248-260Google Scholar, 17Kyte J. Mechanism in Protein Chemistry. Garland Publishing Inc., New York1995: 314-344Google Scholar). Since the mechanism-based inhibitor requires the catalytic apparatus for its action, this type of compound is ideal for the development of highly specific enzyme inhibitors.In contrast, an affinity label is a molecule that is chemically reactive in itself and therefore does not need enzymatic processing to become destructive. This type of inhibitor, which resembles the substrate, will also modify the active site because of its binding specificity. On the other hand, an affinity label could potentially react with any protein to which it binds with sufficient strength. Thus, the distinction between a mechanism-based inhibitor and an affinity label has important pharmacological and biological implications, and the two modes of inactivation can be schematically illustrated as in Fig. 1.Apparently, a critical point in deciding which mechanism best describes the substrate-mediated inactivation of LTA4 hydrolase will be to determine whether or not the enzyme machinery is required for generation of the reactive inactivating molecule. One possible species could be a carbocation, which is formed during nonenzymatic hydrolysis of LTA4 and which also seems to be an intermediate in the conversion of LTA4 into LTB4 (18Andberg M. Hamberg M. Haeggström J.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 23057-23063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar).The Catalytically Inactive Mutant E318A-LTA4 Hydrolase Is Covalently Modified by LTA4Mutagenetic replacement of any of the three zinc binding ligands in LTA4 hydrolase including Glu-318 leads to the combined loss of zinc and enzyme activities (11Medina J.F. Wetterholm A. Rådmark O. Shapiro R. Haeggström J.Z. Vallee B.L. Samuelsson B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7620-7624Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, the mutant E318A-LTA4 hydrolase was selected to study the effects of leukotriene epoxides on an enzyme lacking a key element of catalysis, the fundamental basis for a mechanism-based process. Exposure of E318A-LTA4 hydrolase to LTA4 or LTA4 methyl or ethyl ester resulted in covalent modification of peptide K21 to the same extent as for wild type enzyme (Figs. 2 and3; Table I). This finding is very difficult to rationalize within the concept of a mechanism-based process in which catalytic activation of the substrate is necessary and precedes covalent modification and inactivation. In fact, the degree of modification was even higher in the absence of catalysis (cf. Figs. 2 and 3). Given an affinity-labeling mechanism, the latter observation can be explained by the enzymatic capacity of LTA4 hydrolase to convert the reactive substrate to the stable end product LTB4, thereby suppressing the destructive side reaction with the protein.Covalent Modification of a Nonessential Residue at the Active Site of LTA4 HydrolaseTyr-378 has been identified as a major site to which LTA4 binds during suicide inactivation (8Mueller M.J. Wetterholm A. Blomster M. Jörnvall H. Samuelsson B. Haeggström J.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8383-8387Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Exchange of Tyr-378 for a Phe or Gln rendered the enzyme virtually resistant to suicide inactivation and, in addition, Y378F-LTA4 hydrolase exhibited an increasedk cat for LTA4 (9Mueller M.J. Blomster M. Opperman U.C.T. Jörnvall H. Samuelsson B. Haeggström J.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5931-5935Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Hence, turnover was completely dissociated from inactivation, which shows that Tyr-378 is not critical for catalysis. Modification of a nonessential active-site residue would be consistent with an affinity-labeling mechanism (17Kyte J. Mechanism in Protein Chemistry. Garland Publishing Inc., New York1995: 314-344Google Scholar) in which LTA4 may simply become captured by a proximate nucleophilic residue at the active site, namely Tyr-378.Leukotriene Epoxides Bind to More Than One Site within Peptide K21Although Y378F- and Y378Q-LTA4 hydrolases were not susceptible to covalent modification/inactivation by LTA4 (9Mueller M.J. Blomster M. Opperman U.C.T. Jörnvall H. Samuelsson B. Haeggström J.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5931-5935Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), these two mutants were only partially protected against inactivation by LTA4 methyl and ethyl ester (TableII, Fig. 3), none of which was turned over into a detectable product. Thus, after treatment with esterified LTA4, the epoxide hydrolase activities were reduced, albeit not to the same extent as for wild type enzyme, whereas the peptidase activities were almost unaffected or, in the case of Y378Q-LTA4 hydrolase, even stimulated (Table II). Furthermore, experiments with peptide mapping of Y378F-LTA4 hydrolase treated with the ester derivatives of LTA4 showed that the modification had occurred within peptide K21, which represents at least a part of the substrate binding pocket (Fig. 3). Inasmuch as suicide inactivation of wild type LTA4 hydrolase typically affects both activities to the same extent, the selective inhibition of the epoxide hydrolase activity, without concomitant loss of the peptidase activity, lends further support to the conclusion that the lipid/protein adduct has been formed at a different site in the active center. Hence, although Tyr-378 appears to be best positioned for modification by LTA4, other nucleophilic residues along K21 may also react with the epoxide, at least in the case of esterified LTA4. Moreover, the unproductive binding of LTA4 methyl and ethyl ester to the active site (no detectable formation of LTB4esters) and the tendency to form several alternative covalent bonds would also be consistent with an affinity-labeling mechanism.Molecular Mechanism of Substrate-mediated Inactivation of LTA4 HydrolaseBased on primarily kinetic data, suicide inactivation of LTA4 hydrolase has been interpreted as a mechanism-based process (5Orning L. Jones D.A. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14911-14916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Orning L. Gierse J. Duffin K. Bild G. Krivi G. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22733-22739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, this model is difficult to reconcile with certain properties of LTA4. For instance, the molecule LTA4, its ester derivatives, and structurally related allylic epoxides are all chemically labile compounds that react indiscriminately with all nucleophiles available. In fact, the half-life of LTA4 is less than 10 s in aqueous solutions (25 °C, phosphate buffer, pH 7.4) (19Fitzpatrick F.A. Morton D.R. Wynalda M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 4680-4683Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hence, an additional step of substrate activation does not seem to be required for covalent bond formation/inactivation. The importance of the chemical reactivity of the allylic epoxide in LTA4 for suicide inactivation is also underscored by the fact that other structurally dissimilar allylic epoxides (20Ohishi N. Izumi T. Minami M. Kitamura S. Seyama Y. Ohkawa S. Terao S. Yotsumoto H. Takaku F. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10200-10205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) also inactivate LTA4 hydrolase, whereas non-allylic epoxides do not (Fig.4).Figure 4Structurally related epoxides that can or cannot act as substrates and/or inhibitors of LTA4hydrolase. LTA3 (a), LTA4(b), and LTA5 (c) are all substrates as well as inhibitors of LTA4 hydrolase. Other structural analogues of LTA4 that contain an allylic epoxide and that are not accepted as substrates, e.g.9-cis-11-trans-LTA4 (d), LTA4 methyl ester (e), and 14,15-LTA4 (f) are still efficient inhibitors of LTA4 hydrolase. Epoxides that do not contain an allylic epoxide, e.g.8,10,14-cis-12-trans-LTA4(g), 11,12-epoxy-eicosatrienoic acid (h), and 14,15-epoxy-eicosatrienoic acid (i) are neither substrates nor inhibitors of LTA4 hydrolase. The data has been collected from (20Ohishi N. Izumi T. Minami M. Kitamura S. Seyama Y. Ohkawa S. Terao S. Yotsumoto H. Takaku F. Shimizu T. J. Biol.

Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2627-2631Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and platelet-type 12-lipoxygenase (22Romano M. Chen X. Takahashi Y. Yamamoto S. Funk C.D. Serhan C.N. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), for which LTA4 is a product or a substrate, respectively. Recently, it was also shown that leukocyte-type 12 lipoxygenase converted 15S-hydroperoxy-5,8,11,13-eicosatetraenoic acid to 14,15-LTA4, which bound covalently to the enzyme, leading to irreversible inactivation (23Kishimoto K. Nakamura M. Suzuki H. Yoshimoto T. Yamamoto S. Takao T. Shimonishi Y. Tanabe T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1300: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The catalytic apparatus of a lipoxygenase would be expected to be greatly different from that of an epoxide hydrolase. However, binding specificity of LTA4 to lipoxygenases is reasonable, given the structural similarity between LTA4 and arachidonic acid, the natural substrate of these lipoxygenases. Accordingly, the K i of LTA4 versus 5-lipoxygenase was calculated to ∼2 μm, and the K m versus 12-lipoxygenase was determined to ∼8 μm. Hence, the affinity between LTA4 and the lipoxygenases appears to be of the same, or even higher, strength as that reported for LTA4 hydrolase (K m in the range of 5–30 μm).From analysis of mutated forms of LTA4 hydrolase Y378F/Q and E318A, we have now been able to thoroughly investigate the molecular interactions between enzyme and substrate that occur during suicide inactivation of LTA4 hydrolase. Thus, in contrast to what one would expect from a mechanism-based process, we have shown that covalent modification by LTA4 occurred at the active site of a catalytically incompetent enzyme and that a minimal change of an active-site residue generated an enzyme with increased catalytic efficiency and resistance to suicide inactivation.Taken together, we think that this large body of data is best explained by LTA4 acting as an affinity label. In this model, LTA4 is the natural substrate of the enzyme and at the same time, by virtue of its chemical reactivity, an efficient affinity label. After initial binding of LTA4 to the active site, the hydroxyl group of Tyr-378 may attack the reactive allylic epoxide or a spontaneously formed carbocation thereof to cause covalent modification/enzyme inactivation. Moreover, this mechanistic model agrees well with the current knowledge about LTA4hydrolase, the kinetics of catalysis and inactivation, the chemistry of LTA4, and, most important, the properties of our mutated enzymes. Leukotriene (LT) 1The abbreviations used are: LT, leukotriene; LTA4, 5S-trans-5,6-oxido-7,9-trans-11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid; LTB4, 5S,12R-dihydroxy-6,14-cis-8,10-trans-eicosatetraenoic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: LT, leukotriene; LTA4, 5S-trans-5,6-oxido-7,9-trans-11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid; LTB4, 5S,12R-dihydroxy-6,14-cis-8,10-trans-eicosatetraenoic acid; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography.-A4hydrolase (EC. 3.3.2.6.) is a bifunctional zinc metalloenzyme that converts LTA4 into the proinflammatory substance LTB4, a reaction referred to as the epoxide hydrolase activity (1Haeggström J.Z. Wetterholm A. Medina J.F. Samuelsson B. J. Lipid Mediators. 1993; 6: 1-13PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the enzyme possesses an aminopeptidase activity toward a variety of substrates including synthetic chromogenic amides (2Haeggström J.Z. Wetterholm A. Vallee B.L. Samuelsson B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 173: 431-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), opioid peptides (3Griffin K.J. Gierse J. Krivi G. Fitzpatrick F.A. Prostaglandins. 1992; 44: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and arginyl tripeptides (4Orning L. Gierse J.K. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11269-11273Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the endogenous substrate and the physiological significance of the peptidase activity are still not known. During catalysis, LTA4 hydrolase converts LTA4stereospecifically to LTB4, but a fraction of the substrate will covalently bind to the active site of the enzyme, causing irreversible inactivation of both enzyme activities (5Orning L. Jones D.A. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14911-14916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Orning L. Gierse J. Duffin K. Bild G. Krivi G. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22733-22739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This process, usually referred to as suicide inactivation, has been proposed to be rate-limiting in cellular LTB4 biosynthesis and may therefore be an important mechanism for the overall regulation of this biosynthetic pathway in vivo (7Fitzpatrick F.A. Lepley R. Orning L. Duffin K. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1994; 714: 64-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Using differential Lys-specific peptide mapping, we have recently identified a heneicosapeptide, denoted K21, encompassing the amino acid residues 365–385 of human LTA4 hydrolase, which is involved in the binding of LTA4 and LTA4 methyl and ethyl ester to the native enzyme. In experiments using LTA4 ethyl ester, it was possible to identify Tyr-378 as the residue that is involved in the binding of the lipid (8Mueller M.J. Wetterholm A. Blomster M. Jörnvall H. Samuelsson B. Haeggström J.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8383-8387Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). In a recent study using site-directed mutagenesis, we could show that a conservative replacement at position 378 increased the turnover for epoxide hydrolysis and rendered the enzyme virtually resistant to suicide inactivation with LTA4 (9Mueller M.J. Blomster M. Opperman U.C.T. Jörnvall H. Samuelsson B. Haeggström J.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5931-5935Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Thus, the function of Tyr-378 was not primarily catalytic since (Y378F/Q)LTA4 hydrolase displayed both enzyme activities. However, the hydrolysis of LTA4 catalyzed by the mutated enzymes was affected, leading to a mixture of LTB4 and 5S,12R-dihydroxy-6,10-trans-8,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid in a ratio of 1:0.2 for Y378F and 1:0.3 for Y378Q-LTA4hydrolase, suggesting that the transition state complexes formed with the mutated enzymes are less well defined as compared with that of the wild type enzyme (10Mueller M.J. Andberg M. Samuelsson B. Haeggström J.Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24345-24348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the substrate-mediated inactivation of LTA4 hydrolase by LTA4 is a mechanism-based process (Fig. 1 A), which would imply that the inactivation (i.e. covalent modification) is dependent on turnover and vice versa (5Orning L. Jones D.A. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14911-14916Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Orning L. Gierse J. Duffin K. Bild G. Krivi G. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22733-22739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In order to test this hypothesis, we investigated the interaction of the catalytically incompetent E318A-LTA4hydrolase with LTA4 and LTA4 methyl and ethyl ester. In addition, we investigated the mutated enzymes Y378F and Y378Q-LTA4 hydrolase that are resistant toward substrate-mediated inactivation. Our results indicate that LTA4 is an affinity label rather than a mechanism-based inhibitor that modifies and blocks the active site by virtue of its binding specificity and inherent chemical reactivity. DISCUSSIONLTA4, the key precursor of the biologically active leukotrienes, is an unusual example of an endogenous compound that is both a natural substrate and an irreversible inactivator of a target enzyme, i.e. LTA4 hydrolase. Results obtained by several experimental approaches have indicated that this inactivation of LTA4 hydrolase satisfies criteria of a mechanism-based process (6Orning L. Gierse J. Duffin K. Bild G. Krivi G. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22733-22739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). Thus, after treatment of native and recombinant human LTA4 hydrolase with LTA4 or LTA4 methyl ester, the epoxide hydrolase and peptidase activities are lost simultaneously and irreversibly in a time-dependent, saturable process that is of pseudo first-order kinetics. There is a direct relationship between catalysis and inactivation with equivalent pH dependence for both processes. Active-site specificity has been demonstrated by protection with competitive inhibitors (6Orning L. Gierse J. Duffin K. Bild G. Krivi G. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22733-22739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Mueller M.J. Wetterholm A. Blomster M. Jörnvall H. Samuelsson B. Haeggström J.Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Gierse J. Duffin K. Bild G. Krivi G. Fitzpatrick F.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22733-22739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). From these data, substrate-mediated inactivation of LTA4 hydrolase has been classified as a mechanism-based process. However, all these criteria are also consistent with an affinity-labeling mechanism (Fig.1 B).Mechanism-based Inhibitors Versus Affinity LabelsA mechanism-based inhibitor is an unreactive molecule that is activated by the catalytic machinery of an enzyme into a reactive product which in turn will covalently modify an active-site residue.

Gsα has been shown to play a key role in the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, as evidenced by the following observations. Gsα expression declines dramatically within 48 h of induction of differentiation; constitutive expression of Gsα in 3T3-L1 cells blocks induction of cell differentiation by known inducers; suppression of Gsα expression by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (mimicking the inducer-driven decline in Gsα) accelerates the cell differentiation from a 10-day to a 3-day process in the presence of inducers; and treatment with oligodeoxynucleotides antisense to Gsα alone provokes adipogenesis in the absence of the classical inducers (1Wang H.

Commun. 1989; 165: 929-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Overexpression of the G protein that antagonizes many Gsα effects, Giα2, provokes adipogenesis in either the absence or the presence of the inducers (16Su H.-L. Malbon C.C. Wang H. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1729-C1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The central question remains how Gsα controls cell differentiation. The ability of Gsα to repress adipogenesis is not thought to involve adenylylcyclase based upon the following observations. Elevation of intracellular cAMP concentrations by treating cells with either the diterpene forskolin or pertussis toxin does not affect the differentiation process, direct addition of dibutyryl cAMP itself to the cultures does not alter differentiation, and treatment of cells with 2′,5′-dideoxyadenosine to reduce intracellular cyclic AMP concentrations likewise does not alter differentiation. Treatment of cells with cholera toxin does block adipogenesis, through activation of Gsα, much like expression of the constitutively active mutant form of Gsα (G225T). Although both cholera and pertussis toxins elevate intracellular cAMP, only cholera toxin blocks adipogenesis (6Wang H. Watkins D.C. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Recently, we found that expression of the chimeric G protein in which the sequence 145–235 of Gsα is substituted for the corresponding region of Giα2 (Giα2 1–122/Gsα 145–235/Giα2 236–394) inhibited cell differentiation as effectively as wild-type Gsα (1Wang H. Johnson G.L. Liu X. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22022-22029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). These data indicate that the sequence harboring residues 146–235 of Gsα, which is not the region interacting with adenylate cyclase (17Osawa S. Dhanasekaran N. Woon C.W. Johnson G.L.

Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), which are involved both in contact with βγ complex, binding of guanine nucleotides, as well as the Gap region (20Lambright D.G.

Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to define more precisely the domain and amino acid residues of Gsα that are responsible for the control of adipogenesis, the differentiation of 3T3-L1 embryonic fibroblasts to adipocytes. The repressor domain of Gsα was trisected into smaller sequences that were substituted with the corresponding domains of Giα2 and the chimeras stably expressed in 3T3-L1 cells. Sequences 147–171 and 200–235, but not 172–199 of Gsα are critical in control of cell differentiation. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of sequences 147–171 and 200–235 identified four amino acids (Asn167, Cys200, Val214, and Lys216) and one cluster (Leu203 and Ser205) that are critical to the ability of Gsα to repress differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. Chimeras were constructed from pCW1Gsα, pCW1GsQ227L, pCW1Giα2Q205L, and pCW1Gαi/sBam(1Wang H. Johnson G.L. Liu X. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22022-22029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 17Osawa S. Dhanasekaran N. Woon C.W. Johnson G.L. Cell. 1990; 63: 697-706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The small HindIII fragment of pCW1Gsα and pCW1Giα2Q205L was inserted into the HindIII site of pAlter-1 (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI), respectively. A recombinant with the 5′ of the insert toward the ClaI site of pAlter-1 was selected. The BglII-ClaI fragment of the pAlterGsα was transferred into theBgllI-ClaI site of pAlterGiα2Q205L to avoid twoAflII sites at the 3′ end of the Gsα cDNA (22Jones D.T. Reed R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14241-14249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using site-directed mutagenesis (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI), anMfe3I site and an AflII site were introduced at 690–695 and 773–779 of Gsα, where690CAGCTG695 and773GCTTCGC779 of DNA sequences were changed to690CAATTG695 and 773CTTAAGA779, respectively. The codons for both Gsα and Giα2 were not changed. The plasmid is designated pAlterGsαMA. To construct chimera Gαs1–146/i125–149/s (sisEM), pAlterGiα2Q205L was amplified as using T7 primers and Giα2EcoRI sense oligonucleotide 5′-AAGAATTCTCGGGCGTCATCCGGAGG. The fragment was digested withEcoRI and inserted into the EcoRI sites of pAlterGsαQ227L (the 5′ of the insert toward the ClaI site of pAlter-1). A recombinant displaying the correct orientation was amplified using primers ClaI 21 sense oligonucleotide 5′-GCTAATCGATGATAAGCTGTC and MfeI 26 antisense oligonucleotide 5′-CATTCAATTGATATTCCCGTGAGCGG. The fragment was digested with ClaI and MfeI and inserted into theClaI-MfeI site of pAlterGsαMA. To generate chimera Gαs1–171/i150–177/s (sisMA), pCW1-Giα2Q205L was amplified using as primers, MfeI 31 sense oligonucleotide 5′-ATATCAATTGAATGACTCAGCCGCTTACTAC and AflII 29 antisense oligonucleotide 5′-GGTCCTTAAGACATCCTGCTGTGTAGGGA. The fragment was digested with MfeI and AflII, and inserted into the MfeI-AflII site of pAlterGsαMA. To generate chimera Gαs1–199/i178–213/s (sisAB), pCW1Gαi/sBamHI was amplified using primers as AflII 28 sense oligonucleotide 5′-ATGTCTTAAGGACCCGTGTGAAGACCAC and BglII 21 antisense oligonucleotide 5′-CCCAGCGAGGACCTTCTCAGC. The fragment was digested with AflII and BgllI, and inserted into the AflII-BgllI site of pAlterGsαMA. Mutations were introduced into pAlterGsα by oligonucletide-directed in vitro mutagenesis using a kit purchased from Promega. All mutations and chimeras were verified by restriction enzyme digestion and DNA sequencing using Sequenase Version 2 Kit (U. S. Biochemical, Cleveland, OH). To subclone all the chimeras and mutants, pCW1GsαQ227L was partially digested with HindIII, filled in by Klenow fragment, and then ligated. Plasmids lacking the HindIII site at the 3′ end of Gsα were selected. All chimeras and mutants were digested withHindIII and BglII and the isolated fragments of interest inserted into the HindIII-BglII site of the plasmid. Direct dideoxy sequencing was employed to verify the sequence of the chimeras and mutations. All mutants and chimera were constructed from wild-type versions of Gsα and Giα2 with normal intrinsic GTPase activity. Mouse embryo fibroblast 3T3-L1 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Cells were maintained in culture in 100-mm Petri dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The protocols for stable transfection of 3T3-L1 cells employed in these studies were described previously (6Wang H. Watkins D.C. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 16Su H.-L. Malbon C.C. Wang H. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1729-C1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Stably transfected clones were selected (400 μg/ml) and then maintained (100 μg/ml) in the presence of the active form of the gentamicin analogue, G418 sulfate (Life Technologies, Inc.). Aliquots of crude membrane fractions (50 μg of protein/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis/lane) from aliquots of each subclone were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose and the blots were stained with a rabbit polyclonal antibody specific for Gsα (CM129). The immune complexes were made visible by staining with a second antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG) coupled to calf alkaline phosphatase (6Wang H. Watkins D.C. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Aliquots (0.5 × 105 cells) of 3T3-L1 cells were washed and incubated in Kreb's phosphate buffer (pH 7.5, 106 cells/ml) containing the cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor Ro 20-1724 (0.1 mm) in either the absence or the presence of the β-adrenergic agonist (−) isoproterenol (10 μm) for 15 min at 37 °C. The reaction was terminated by the addition of ethanol. Measurements of cyclic AMP accumulation were made in triplicate from separate aliquots of cells. Cyclic AMP accumulation was determined by the competitive protein binding assay, using the bovine adrenal cyclic AMP-binding protein (23Brown B.L. Albano J.D.M. Ekins R.P. Sgherzi A.M. Biochem. J. 1971; 121: 561-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (1295) Google Scholar). Clones transfected with vector, wild type Gsα, chimeras or mutants were maintained in 24-well plates for propagation. The differentiation protocol was described previously (1Wang H. Johnson G.L. Liu X. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22022-22029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Protocols for histochemical staining techniques are described in detail elsewhere (6Wang H. Watkins D.C. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar, 16Su H.-L. Malbon C.C. Wang H. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C1729-C1735Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Adipogenesis was established via staining of accumulated lipid with oil red O. The strategy adopted to the analysis of the sequence of Gsα responsible for the repression of adipogenesis was based upon our previous analysis in which the sequence of 145–235 of Gsα was identified as critical (1Wang H. Johnson G.L. Liu X. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22022-22029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Gsα sequence 145–235 embedded into the corresponding region of Giα2 retains the full capacity to block adipogenesis (1Wang H. Johnson G.L. Liu X. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22022-22029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The primary goal was to analyze by alanine-scanning mutagenesis the fine detail of the region of Gsα repressing adipogenesis. To make the task manageable, the region(s) of Gsα to be subjected to alanine-scanning mutagenesis had to be smaller than the parent sequence 145–235. To accomplish the task, the “repressor” region of Gsα was trisected and regions 125–149, 150–177, and 178–213 of Giα2 substituted individually for the corresponding region of Gsα. The chimeras constructed in this fashion are displayed in Fig. 1. The inability of a chimera with the Giα2 region embedded in Gsα to repress adipogenesis would identify region(s) as candidate(s) for further analysis by alanine-scanning mutagenesis. The cDNAs encoding each of the chimeras (Fig. 1) were inserted individually in the pCW1 mammalian expression vector. The pCW1 vector is driven by the SV40 early promoter and harbors a selectable marker, the neomycin resistance gene (neo r). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts were stably transfected and the derivative clones were selected in the presence of the gentamicin analogue G418. Each of the clones selected displays expression of Gsα well in excess of that observed in the cells stably transfected with the empty vector alone (Fig. 2 A). Immunoblots of cell membranes prepared from the stably transfected clones were stained with a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the decapeptide C terminus of Gsα (CM129). Expression of Gsα in clones harboring the expression vector for a chimera minimally was approximately 1-fold greater than the endogenous levels of Gsα expressed by 3T3-L1 clones stably transfected with the empty vector pCW1 alone. Constitutive expression of Gsα at a level 50% greater or more that endogenous Gsα is readily able to repress the ability of dexamethasone and MIX to induce adipogenesis (1Wang H. Johnson G.L. Liu X. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22022-22029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Chimeras of Gsα in which a smaller region of Giα2 (125–149, 150–177, or 178–213) was substituted for the corresponding region in Gsα had little effect on the cAMP response of the clones to stimulation by isoproterenol, when compared with cells transfected with wild-type Gsα alone. Basal cAMP accumulation of these clones in comparison to that of the transfectants expressing wild-type Gsα alone was reduced slightly, perhaps reflecting the predominant Giα2 nature of the expressed protein (Fig.2 B). Earlier studies have demonstrated that Gsα-Giα2 chimera with these types of substitutions retain their capacity to bind GTP and transduce signaling (17Osawa S. Dhanasekaran N. Woon C.W. Johnson G.L. Cell. 1990; 63: 697-706Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 24Gupta S.K. Dhanasekaran N. Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 47: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Adipogenesis is readily detected by staining the cultures for lipid accumulation with oil red O (Fig. 3). The cellular nuclei were made visible by counterstaining with hematoxylin. For clones stably transfected with the empty expression vector, no differentiation was observed in the absence of the inducers dexamethasone + MIX (Fig. 3, panel A). When exposed to dexamethasone + MIX, cultures harboring the empty expression vector pCW1 display robust differentiation (panel B). Marked lipid accumulation, the hallmark of adipocytes, was evidenced throughout the cultures, as shown earlier (1Wang H. Johnson G.L. Liu X. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22022-22029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 6Wang H. Watkins D.C. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Clones constitutively expressing wild-type Gsα, in contrast, do not respond to induction by dexamethasone + MIX, failing to differentiate into adipocytes (panel D). Clones expressing either chimera sisEM (panel F) or chimera sisAB (panel J) displayed phenotypes identical to clones transfected with empty vector, fully differentiating in response to dexamethasone + MIX and replete with accumulated lipid stained by the oil red O. Chimera sisMA, in sharp contrast, continues to repress dexamethasone + MIX-induced adipogenesis (panel H) much like expression of wild-type Gsα (panel D). These data demonstrate that regions 147–171 (sisEM) and 200–235 (sisAB) of Gsα are critical in the control of adipogenesis, when substituted with the corresponding region of Giα2 the chimera lose the ability to repress adipogenesis. Region 172–199 of Gsα, to the contrary, appears to be dispensable and can be replaced by the corresponding region of Giα2 without altering the ability of chimera to repress adipogenesis. Having identified two smaller regions of Gsα critical for expression of its ability to repress adipogenesis, we developed a strategy to perform alanine-scanning mutagenesis within the sisEM domain and analyze the influence of these mutations on the repressor function of the expressed molecule. Initial mutagenesis created both single (GsαM3, GsαM5, and GsαM6) and multiple (GsαM1, GsαM2, GsαM4, and GsαM7-M10) alanine substitutions in protein sequences 147–171 and 200–235 of Gsα (Fig. 4,A and B), presuming that alanine substitution of a critical residue would abolish the ability of the mutant Gsα to repress adipogenesis. Clones stably transfected with pCW1 harboring the cDNA of Gsα with one or more mutations displayed increased immunoreactive Gsα, reflecting the expression of the mutant forms in excess of the endogenous level of Gsα. Clones were selected that expressed the mutant Gsα molecules at levels approximately 1-fold greater than the staining observed in clones harboring empty vector alone (Fig.5 A). All of the clones expressing Gsα mutants display elevated levels of basal cAMP accumulation compared with clones harboring empty expression vector alone and each displayed isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP accumulation (Fig. 5 B).Figure 5Stable expression of wild-type and alanine-scanning mutant forms of Gsα in 3T3-L1 cell clones: analysis by immunoblotting and cyclic AMP accumulation.

Clones constitutively expressing GsαM1, 2, 3, and 4 (panels C, D, E, and F, respectively) were refractory to induction of adipogenesis. In contrast, expression of GsαM5, a single alanine substitution for asparagine at position 167 abolishes the ability of the mutant form of Gsα to repress adipogenesis (panel G). Clones expressing N167A Gsα no longer repressed adipogenesis, displaying robust lipid accumulation in response to inducers (panel G), much like the wild-type cultures of 3T3-L1 or the clones stably transfected with empty expression vector alone (panel A). Analysis of the sisAB region (Gsα residues 200–235) initially focused upon aspartic acid residue 229 which was the only residue within the region of 221–235 of Gsα that varied from that of Giα2 (Fig. 4 B). The D229S mutant form of Gsα retains its ability to repress adipogenesis in clones challenged with dexamethasone + MIX (Fig. 3, panel L). With the C-terminal region of the AB region shown to be unimportant in the repressor activity of Gsα, alanine-scanning mutagenesis was focused upon the N-terminal sequence from residue 200–220 of this region (Fig. 4 B). Five mutations, one a single alanine substitution (GsαM6) and the others multiple substitutions (GsαM7-M10), were constructed and shown to be expressed in stably transfected clones at >1-fold over endogenous Gsα (Fig. 5 A). These clones displayed increased basal cAMP accumulation over that observed for clones expressing the endogenous Gsα (Fig. 5 B) and were examined further for their ability to respond to induction with dexamethasone + MIX. Expression of GsαM6 (C200A) abolished the ability of Gsα to repress adipogenesis in the clones (Fig. 6, panel H). Clones expressing C200A Gsα now stain prominently for accumulated lipid following treatment with dexamethasone + MIX. Expression of GsαM7 (L203A and S205A), likewise, abolished the ability of Gsα to repress adipogenesis in response to dexamethasone + MIX, resulting in robust lipid accumulation in the clones (Fig. 6, panel I). In contrast, alanine substitution for Phe208 and Lys211 of Gsα in the clones expressing GsαM8 had no discernible effect on the ability of Gsα to repress adipogenesis, as demonstrated by the absence of oil red O staining of lipid in these clones (Fig. 6, panel J). The triple mutation of Gln213, Val214, and Asp215 to alanine resulted in a loss of repressor activity for the mutant GsαM9 (Fig. 6, panel K). In the presence of the inducers dexamethasone + MIX, clones expressing the GsαM9 mutant form of Gsα fully differentiated into adipocytes, staining prominently by oil red O. Substitution of Lys216, Val217, Asn218, and His220 with alanine also abolished the ability of the mutant Gsα to repress adipogenesis in response to dexamethasone + MIX (Fig. 6, panel L). Thus, the mutations found in GsαM6, 7, 9, and 10 render the Gsα unable to repress adipogenesis as does the wild-type Gsα (Fig. 6, panel B). The alanine-scanning mutagenesis of single residues had revealed that N167A Gsα and C200A Gsα mutants were devoid of repressor activity. Mutagenesis of multiple residues as a single cassette identified regions critical for repressor activity, whereas establishing the precise residue(s) necessary for repressor activity of Gsα would require finer detailed analysis. Single point alanine substitutions were created for each of nine residues implicated as critical to the repressor activity of Gsα (Fig. 4 C). Mutant forms of Gsα were stably transfected at levels approximately 1-fold greater than that of endogenous Gsα (Fig. 7). Although GsαM7 with L203A and S205A double mutation has lost the ability of Gsα to repress adipogenesis in response to dexamethasone + MIX (Fig. 6, panel I, and Fig.8, row A, panel c), single point mutations of L203A (Fig. 8, row A, panel d) or S205A (Fig. 8, row A, panel e) were without effect on the repressor activity. These data argue persuasively that Leu203 and Ser205 together play a critical role in the control of adipogenesis exerted by Gsα.Figure 8Expression of GsL203A, GsS205A, GsQ213A, GsD215A, GsV217A, GsN218A, and GsH220A, but not GsV214A nor GsK216A, block induction of adipogenesis: analysis by oil red O staining.Stably transfected clones expressing empty vector (pCW1), Gsα (αs), and nine Gsα single alanine substitution mutants were plated on coverslips and propagated in 24-well culture plates. At confluence (day 0), one set of cells were treated with dexamethasone and methylisobutylxanthine (+D/M). Dexamethasone + MIX were removed after incubation for 2 days, and the cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 10 days. A second replicate set of cells was maintained in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum in the absence of dexamethasone + MIX (not differentiated and not shown). At day 10, cells were fixed by 3% paraformaldehyde for 5 min and stained with oil red O for 10 min. The darkly stainedbodies of the cytosol are oil droplets. Bar, 100 μm. Data represent six different clones and at least two independent series of transfection experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The expression of GsαM9, a mutant form of Gsα with alanine substitution of Gln213, Val214, and Asp215, resulted in the loss of repressor activity (Fig. 6,panel K, and Fig. 8, row B, panels b–d). The single point mutation of G213A had no discernable effect on the ability of the mutant Gsα to repress adipogenesis. Similarly, mutation of D215A resulted in a mutant form of Gsα that fully repressed the ability of dexamethasone + MIX to induce differentiation, just as observed with constitutive expression of wild-type Gsα. In sharp contrast to the G213A and D215A mutations, alanine substitution of Val 214 abolished the ability of Gsα to repress adipogenesis of the clones in response to dexamethasone + MIX. These data reveal the basis of the GsαM9 cassette of mutations to abolish the repressor activity of Gsα resides solely in the V214A mutation. The GsαM10 cassette of mutations includes K216A, V217A, N218A, and H220A (Fig. 4 B). This cluster of alanine substitutions was analyzed further by creation of stably transfected clones of 3T3-L1 cells that expression of each of the individual mutations of the sisAB region of Gsα (Fig. 4, panel C). Although expression of the GsαM10 cassette eliminates the ability of Gsα to repress adipogenesis in the clones, single alanine substitutions of V217A, N218A, and H220A were without effect, i.e. constitutive expression of each of the single mutant forms of Gsα repressed the ability of dexamethasone + MIX to induce adipogenesis equally well (Fig. 8, row C, panels b–e). Only one of the mutations, K216A, was found to mimic the effects of the GsαM10 cassette on loss of repressor activity by Gsα. Single mutations of N167A, C200A, V214A, and K216A as well as the double mutation L203A,S205A abolished the ability of expressed Gsα to repress adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells. Mutant forms of Gsα were expressed at levels approximately 1-fold greater than that of endogenous Gsα (Fig. 9 A) and retained the ability to elevate both basal cyclic AMP accumulation and mediate stimulation of cyclic AMP accumulation in response to isoproterenol (Fig. 9 B). Comparisons of the sequences of the domains in Gsα (Tyr147–Leu171 and Cys200–Ile235) that repress adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 cells with the corresponding sequences of other G protein α subunits reveals significant levels of non-identity. Many residues within these two protein sequences, however, such as Ile180, Glu182, Arg193, Gly199, Gln200, Arg201, Glu203, Lys206, and Trp207 involved in binding of βγ complex by Gtα are conserved in Gsα also (21Lambright D.G.

The protein sequence Met221–Ile235 of Gsα is highly conserved in virtually all of the heterotrimeric G protein α subunits (21Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B.

In an effort to define more precisely the residues within the putative repressor domains that are required for the control of adipogenesis, the amino acid sequences of Gsα and Giα2 were compared (22Jones D.T. Reed R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14241-14249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as displayed in Fig. 4 (panels A–C). The displays identify 35 identical residues within these domains. Of the 35 residues noted, 28 are conserved in all heterotrimeric G protein α subunits (21Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). Of the 26 nonidentical residues, 21 were mutated to alanine in clusters targeting the regions of interest in chimeras sisEM and sisAB (Fig. 4). The remaining five amino acids (Ala150, Lys151, Ala152, Asp229, and Arg232) include naturally occurring alanine at positions 150 and 152, and therefore were not studied further. Asp 229 is the only non-conserved residue of Gsα found in the sequence from 221 to 235, and D229S mutant form of Gsα is shown in the present work to retain the ability to repress adipogenesis (Fig. 3). Mutagenesis of either Lys151 or Arg232 was not undertaken, simply because other mammalian heterotrimeric G protein α subunits have the same amino acids at these positions (21Lambright D.G. Sondek J. Bohm A. Skiba N.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1996; 379: 311-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar), and the lysine for arginine substitution is considered a conservative substitution. The focus of the analysis was to evaluate the structural basis for repression of adipogenesis by Gsα, exploiting our knowledge of the repressor domain by alanine-scanning mutagenesis. Repressor activity of protein sequence 146–235 of Gsα was identified (6Wang H. Watkins D.C. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar) through the construction and then expression of various chimeras between Gsα (repressor) and corresponding regions of Giα2 (activator). The ability of these Gsα/Giα2 chimeras to block adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 clones challenged with well-known inducers of differentiation was evaluated (1Wang H. Johnson G.L. Liu X. Malbon C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22022-22029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Since Giα2 and Giα1 display more than 95% identify in their primary sequence (22Jones D.T. Reed R.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14241-14249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the crystal structure of Giα1-GTPγS was adapted for a first-approximation description of the regions of Giα2 analyzed in the present work (Fig.10). The structure displayed is that of Giα1 in which domains EM (147–171), MA (172–199), and AB (200–235) are projected as regions I, II, andIII, respectively. The major region implicated in control of adenylylcyclase (AC) is displayed in yellow (9Bourne H.R. Sanders D.A. McCormick F. Nature. 1990; 348: 125-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (1816) Google Scholar), while that for regions I (EM), II (MA), and III (AB) are rendered cyan,green, and blue, respectively (Fig. 10,panels A and B). Maintaining the same landmarks of conserved regions, the projection of Gsα residues upon the corresponding structure of Giα2 would place Leu203 and Ser205 at positions of Giα1 residues Lys180and Thr182, respectively (Fig. 10, panel C). In Giα1, Lys180 and Thr182 appear as exposed residues, available for protein-protein contact. It is of interest that Lys180 and Thr182 of Giα1 have been shown to participate in the binding of the GTPase activator for Giα1, RGS4 (24Gupta S.K. Dhanasekaran N. Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. J. Cell. Biochem. 1991; 47: 359-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Both Leu203 and Ser205 are essential residues to the repressor activity of Gsα, substitution of both to alanine abolishes the ability of the mutant Gsα to block adipogenesis. The results predict that this domain (Fig. 10,panel D) is an important contact site for Gsα with the effector controlling differentiation in these cells or that these residues, when altered via mutagenesis, interrupt some extended conformation of Gsα critical to the repressor activity of the molecule. The Cys200 residue is a unique feature of Gsα, not shared by any other heterotrimeric G protein α subunit (Fig. 4). Cys200 is a critical residue for Gsα function with respect to repression of adipogenesis. Alanine substitution of Cys200 effectively abolished the ability of Gsα to exert its repressor activity on adipogenesis. Projection of this information on the structure of Giα1 identifies Thr 177 (Fig. 10, panels C and D), a residue located in the C-terminal end of Switch I region near the junction with linker 2 (19Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 20Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar). Cys200 of Gsα is embedded in a sequence highly conserved among G protein α subunits Leu Arg Cys Arg Val Xaa Thr, including Giα1, Giα2, and Goα. The projections suggest that Leu203 and Ser205 (both in Switch I region) as well as Cys200 are in close proximity and likely exposed residues important in Gsα repressor function (Fig. 10, panel D). Three of the remaining residues critical to repressor activity, Asn167, Val214, and Lys216, appear to be exposed when projected upon the corresponding area of the Giα1 structure (Fig. 10, panels C and D). Asn167, located at the flex region between α helices D and E (19Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 20Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), is embedded in the sequence Arg Ser Asn Glu Tyr Gln Leu that is highly conserved among G protein α subunits including Gsα, Giα1, Giα2, and Goα. Val214 and Lys216, located in the C-terminal reach of Switch I region (19Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Science. 1994; 265: 1405-1412Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar, 20Lambright D.G. Noel J.P. Hamm H.E. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1994; 369: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar), are embedded in a unique region of six residues in Gsα flanked both by 10 residues N-terminal as well as 20 residues C-terminal that display a high degree of conservation among several G protein α subunits, including Giα1, Giα2, and Goα. The protein sequence 213–218 of Gsα would appear to play some unique role(s) in its function, including a critical role in repressor activity, since alanine substitution of either Val214 or Lys216abolishes the ability of Gsα to block adipogenesis. The recent elucidation of the crystal structure of Gsα at 2.5 A in a complex with GTPγS (25Tesmer J.J.G. Berman D.M. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar) affords the opportunity to relate the mutagenesis data to the structure of Gsα (Fig.11). To facilitate the discussion, the domain of Gsα implicated in the control of adenylylcyclase (AC) is displayed in yellow, while the GTP organizing elements Switch 1 (Sw1), Switch 2 (Sw2), and Switch 3 (Sw3) are rendered in cyan,blue, and green, respectively (Fig. 11,panel A). The Leu203, Ser205cluster, essential for represser activity of Gsα, is displayed in white (Fig. 11, panel A), as are Asn167, Val214, and Lys216 residues (Fig. 11,panel B). Cys200 is far less visible in the Gsα-GTPγS structure than in the Giα1-GTPγS structure (Fig. 11,panel A). A stick model of Gsα, in which the GTP molecule has been purposely deleted from the structure, illuminates all of the residues essential for the repressor activity of Gsα (Fig. 11,panel C). Inspection of the ribbon and coil diagram of Gsα highlights the critical placement of the Leu203, Ser205 cluster in Switch 1 (Sw1), the proximity of Asn167 to Switch 3 (Sw3), and the exposure of Val214 and Lys216 (Fig. 11, panel D). The current study adds to our expanding understanding of the structure-activity relationships in the Gsα molecule. Constitutive expression of Gsα blocks adipogenesis and induction of adipogenesis occurs through a rapid loss of Gsα in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Using construction of chimeric α subunits as well as alanine-scanning mutagenesis we provide an insight into the regions of Gsα that are required for repressor activity. The regions do not overlap with those implicated in the control of adenylylcyclase (Figs. 10 and 11). In concert, alterations in intracellular cyclic AMP accumulation fail to influence either the induction or the course of adipogenesis (6Wang H. Watkins D.C. Malbon C.C. Nature. 1992; 358: 334-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). The nature of the effector through which Gsα repressed adipogenesis remains unsolved. The structural information garnered from the current analysis will assist in efforts aimed at identifying this additional and novel effector for Gsα. We express our thanks to Erich Bremer for expert assistance in molecular modeling and to Dr. Stephen Sprang (Department of Pharmacology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, Dallas, TX) for providing to us the coordinates for the crystal structure of GTPγS-bound form of Gsα."
https://openalex.org/W1972086241,"Stimulation of the T cell antigen receptor (TCR) triggers a complex series of signaling events that culminate in T cell activation and proliferation. The complex structure of the TCR has hindered efforts to link specific signaling events induced by TCR cross-linkage to downstream activation responses, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) gene transcription. Previous studies have shown that the polyomavirus-derived oncoprotein, middle T antigen (mT), transforms rodent fibroblasts by interacting with and activating several cytoplasmic signaling proteins (Src kinases, phospholipase C (PLC)-γ1, Shc, and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) implicated in cell growth control. In this study, we demonstrate that expression of mT activates Jurkat T cells, as measured by increases in IL-2 promoter- and NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells)-dependent reporter gene transcription. The transcriptional response provoked by mT was blocked by the immunosuppressive drug FK506, a potent inhibitor of TCR-mediated IL-2 gene expression. Mutations that disrupted the binding of mT to Src kinases or PLC-γ1 abrogated the ability of mT to deliver the signals needed for IL-2 promoter activation. In contrast, a mT mutant that failed to bind PI3-K induced a markedly elevated transcriptional response in Jurkat cells, whereas mutation of the Shc binding site in mT had little effect on the transactivating potential of this viral oncoprotein. Additional studies demonstrated that the association of mT with PLC-γ1 was necessary and sufficient to activate both Ca<sup>2+</sup>- and Ras-dependent signaling cascades in Jurkat cells. These results indicate that PLC-γ1 activation plays pivotal and pleiotropic roles in the stimulation of IL-2 gene expression, whereas activation of PI3-K negatively modulates this response in Jurkat T cells."

Neutrophils are the major type of cell involved in the early stages of many forms of acute inflammation. The neutrophil accumulation in the lung can cause disease by damaging normal host tissue as in the case of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) 1The abbreviations used are: ARDS, adult respiratory distress syndrome; E-selectin, endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule-1; ICAM-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FACS, fluorescence-activated cell sorter;F v , variable domain fragment; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; IL-1β, interleukin-1β; PEG8k, polyethylene glycol with an average molecular weight of 8,000; CDR, complementary determining regions.

Blood Cells. 1990; 16: 25-42PubMed Google Scholar), in the inflammation response (asthma, and graft rejection), or in insult as a result of trauma or bacterial infection. Cell surface receptors such as E-selectin (also called ELAM-1; endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule) belong to a subclass of the IgG superfamily, including VCAM (vascular cell adhesion molecule) and ICAM (intercellular adhesion molecules 1, 2, and 3). E-selectin reacts with a fucosylated carbohydrate residue on the neutrophil (3Foxall C. Watson S.R. Dowbencko D. Fennie C. Lasky L.A. Kiso M. Hasegawa A. Asa D. Brandley B.K. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 895-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar), whereas the leukocyte integrins containing the CD18 antigen react with ICAM-1. The expression of E-selectin and ICAM-1 is induced by cytokines produced at the site of inflammation. This serves to enhance neutrophil adherence to endothelial cells and migration from the circulation into extracellular tissues at these sites. Neutrophils contribute further to the inflammatory process by releasing tissue-damaging mediators. E-selectin is a member of the selectin gene family. Each of these proteins is composed of an amino-terminal lectin domain followed by an epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) domain, five complement regulatory repeat units, a single membrane-spanning region and a carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic domain. The lectin and the EGF domains are both necessary and sufficient to mediate neutrophil adhesion (4Walz G. Aruffo A. Kolanus W. Bevilacqua M. Seed B. Science. 1990; 250: 1132-1135Crossref PubMed Scopus (887) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of the lectin/EGF domains that includes the ligand-binding region has been reported for this molecule (1Graves B.J. Crowther R.L. Chandran C. Rumberger M. Li S. Huang K. Presky D.H. Famillety P.C. Wolitzky B.A. Burns D.K. Nature. 1994; 367: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). A specific surface region of the lectin domain of E-selectin that contains a loop between β-strands β4 and β5 with exposed Tyr-94 and Arg-97 side chains has been implicated in ligand binding based on the structural and related biochemical studies (1Graves B.J. Crowther R.L. Chandran C. Rumberger M. Li S. Huang K. Presky D.H. Famillety P.C. Wolitzky B.A. Burns D.K. Nature. 1994; 367: 532-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). Antibodies and antibody fragments specific for the cell-surface receptors have the potential for modulating the interaction of neutrophils with endothelial cells, and hence, the inflammatory response. A monoclonal anti-ICAM-1 antibody R6.5, that inhibits the attachment of neutrophils to endothelium and also prevents the attachment of major group human rhinovirus (HRV) to ICAM-1, has been reported (5Kolatkar P.R. Oliveira M.A. Rossman M.G. Robbins A.H. Katti S.K. Hoover-Litty H. Forte C. Greve J.M. McClelland A. Olson N.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 225: 1127-1130Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Recently, the structure of the Fab fragment of this antibody was reported at 2.8 Å resolution (6Jedrzejas M.J. Miglietta J. Griffin J.A. Luo M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1995; 51: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The surface contour of the antigen-combining site of this molecule has a groove that resembles more the structure of an antipolypeptide antibody than the structure of an antiprotein antibody. Another potent blocking antibody directed at a cell surface receptor, E-selectin in this case, has been raised. This antibody binds to the lectin/EGF domain of E-selectin. 2W. Newman, unpublished observation. We report here the primary and three-dimensional structures of the Fab fragment determined by automated Edman degradation analysis of proteolytic fragments of the heavy and light chains of the antibody and by x-ray crystallographic techniques at 2.8 Å resolution, respectively. The analysis of the structural studies of the anti-E-selectin 7A9 Fab presented here focuses on the complementary determining regions and the comparison with the three-dimensional structures of an anti-ICAM Fab and the anti-human rhinovirus Fab. The perfusion system used was a 50-liter stirred tank bioreactor utilizing an external rotating filter. SP-20 fusion mouse-mouse hybridoma cells were cultured in a medium with a protein-free formulation, and 0.1% Pluronic F-63 (Sigma) was added for shear protection. The cell densities were maintained at 1 × 107 viable cell counts/ml and perfusion-adjusted to keep nutrients (glucose, etc.) and metabolites at the appropriate levels. Ion exchange and affinity chromatography were used to purify the antibody. The conversion of 7A9 antibody to F(ab′)2 was accomplished by incubating the IgG1 with pepsin (E:S of 1:100) for 2 h at 37 °C, after adjusting pH to 3.5 using 1.0 m citrate buffer. The digestion products were subjected to cation-exchange chromatography in an S-Sephacryl fast flow column, using a linear sodium chloride gradient (0.1–0.5 m) in 20 mmacetate buffer, pH 5.0, as eluant. F(ab′)2 eluted as a single peak with purity greater than 97%, as judged from SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (results not shown). Titration analysis of the intact antibody and of the F(ab′)2 was performed using a Coulter FACS Elite Analyzer. Samples for the flow cytometry analysis of endothelial cells (human umbilical vein endothelial cell, HUVEC) included stimulation with and without interleukin-1β (IL-1β). This assay measures the number of cells that shift to greater fluorescence intensity after specific binding (positive response). In this analysis, the intact 7A9 antibody and the F(ab′)2 fragment showed comparable binding efficiency to the surface of HUVEC cells on a molar basis, indicating that the digestion with pepsin did not affect its binding ability (Fig. 1 A). Biological activity was based on inhibition of HL60 (a myeloid leukemia line from ATCC) binding to soluble E-selectin assay (7Newman W. Beall L.D. Carson C.W. Hunder G.C. Graben N. Randhawa I.Z. Gopal T.V. Wiener-Kronish J. Matthay M.A. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 644-654PubMed Google Scholar). Ten μg/ml of the 7A9 antibody F(ab′)2 fragment were added in wells, followed by51Cr-labeled HL60 cells (105/well) and incubated for 30 min at 22 °C in a static adhesion assay. Nonadherent cells were removed by rinsing with 1% bovine serum albumin in 0.1 m phosphate-buffered saline, and the residual activity in the wells was measured in a γ counter. The details of the assay have been previously described (8Graber N. Gopal T.V. Wilson D. Beall L.D. Polte T. Newman W. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 819-830PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 1 B shows that the anti-E-selectin antibody F(ab′)2 fragment is inhibitory to granulocyte binding to HL60 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The amino acid sequences of the F(ab′)2 heavy and light chains were determined after separating both chains of the reduced, alkylated intact 7A9. The samples were reduced with dithiotreitol, alkylated with vinylpyridine or iodoacetamide, and purified by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography. Each purified chain was subjected to automated Edman degradation analysis. Additionally, a reduced alkylated sample from purified F(ab′)2 was digested with Lys-C protease, and the resulting fragments were separated by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography using a C-18 column. The amino acid sequences of the purified peptides were determined by using a protein microsequencer (ABI, Model 477-A) coupled to an on-line PTH-Analyzer (Model 120-A) and a 900-A data reduction module. Digestion with Lys-C protease resulted in 26 peaks for the heavy and light chains of an Fab fragment (chromatogram not shown). Fig. 2 shows the complete amino acid sequence for each of the peaks in the heavy and light chains of the fragment. The sequences of the two chains are consistent with that of the IgG1 class with an associated κ light chain. Both the heavy and light chains have two intra-chain disulfide bridges. The sequences of the six CDRs are indicated in Fig. 2. The F(ab′)2 was incubated before the crystallization trials with dithiotreitol for 19 h at a ratio of 2:1 (w/w). The initial crystallization trials were performed using a “fast screen” approach (9Jancarik J. Kim S.-H. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 409-411Crossref Scopus (2076) Google Scholar) employing the Hampton Research Crystal Screen kit (10Cudney B. Patel S. Weisgraber K. Newhouse Y. McPherson A. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1994; 50: 414-415Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Experiments were set up using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method (11Wlodawer A. Hodgson K.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 398-399Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For the screen, the crystallization drops were prepared by mixing 3 μl of a solution containing 9.6 mg/ml protein in 10 mm HEPES/HCl at pH 7.0 with an equal volume of the reservoir solution. Initially, small crystals appeared in droplets equilibrated against well solutions containing 0.2m (NH4)2SO4, 0.1m sodium cacodylate, 30% (w/v) PEG8k at pH 6.5. Refinement of the crystallization conditions was performed using sitting drop vapor diffusion experiments (12Gilliland G.L. Davies D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 104: 370-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The final reservoir solution consisted of 0.2 m(NH4)2SO4, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate, and 20% (w/v) PEG8k at pH 6.5. Crystals appeared within 3 days at room temperature and grew to full size within 2 weeks (typical dimensions of 0.2 × 0.3 × 0.7 mm3). The diffraction data were collected at room temperature using a Siemens electronic area detector. This detector was mounted on a Rigaku RU-200 generator operated at 40 kV, 60 mA with a 0.3-mm focal spot. A graphite monochromator followed by a 0.5-mm collimator was used. During data collection, the area detector was mounted 16 cm from the crystal and 2θ was 16°. Diffraction data collected with the area detector were electronic images, each comprising a 0.2° oscillation counted for 3 min. The determination of unit cell parameters, crystal orientation, and the integration of the reflection intensities were carried out with the XENGEN program system (13Howard A.J. Gilliland G.L. Finzel B.C. Poulos T.L. Ohlendorf D.H. Salemme F.R. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1987; 20: 383-387Crossref Scopus (570) Google Scholar). The crystals are orthorhombic, belonging to space group P212121with unit cell constants a = 44.5 Å, b= 83.8 Å, and c = 132.5 Å. The volume of this cell indicates one Fab molecule in the asymmetric unit with aV m (14Matthews B.W. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 33: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (7927) Google Scholar) of 2.66 Å3/dalton, corresponding to a solvent content of 53%. From a total of 42,928 observations extending to 2.8 Å resolution, a unique data set of 10,993 reflections (86.5% complete; I > 2.1 ς(I)) was obtained with a merging R-factor of 0.068. The structure of the 7A9 Fab fragment was determined by molecular replacement (15Rossmann M.G. Blow D.M. Acta Crystallogr. 1962; 15: 24-31Crossref Google Scholar) followed by iterations of expanding and adjusting the model to fit the electron density map and refining the structure. The molecular replacement and refinement calculations employed the X-PLOR program package (16Brünger A.T. X-PLOR (Version 3.1) Manual. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992: 187-206Google Scholar). All the model building and correction procedures were carried out using the program QUANTA Version 4.1.1 (Molecular Simulations Inc., Burlington, MA). The search model used in the molecular replacement calculations was based on the crystal structure of the Fab 8F5 that neutralizes human rhinovirus serotype 2 (Protein Data Bank code 1BBD) (17Tormo J.

This Fab has a high percentage of sequence identity with the 7A9 Fab, 96% for the light chain and 83% for the heavy chain, although its elbow bend angle is the smallest reported to date (127°). The search probe was constructed by truncating the side chains at the CB or CA atoms for all corresponding residues that were different between the 8F5 and the 7A9 Fabs. The rotation search was done using the intact probe with variable “elbow bend” angles between variable (V) and constant (C) domains ranging from 127° to 167° (16Brünger A.T. X-PLOR (Version 3.1) Manual. Yale University Press, New Haven, CT1992: 187-206Google Scholar). The largest peak in the rotational function search was 6 ς above background at the Eulerian angles α = 94.1°, β = 15.0°, and γ = 314.1°. The Patterson correlation refinement of the rotation function peak gave final angles of α = 93.5°, β = 16.2°, and γ=315.7°, with a correlation coefficient of 0.018. The solution was obtained at an elbow angle of 162°. Using this rotation function solution, the translation function search produced a solution at x = 8.9,y = 25.1, and z = 57.9. It was 8.5 ς above the background and 2.2 ς above the next highest peak. The application of the rotation and translation solutions to the probe molecule gave a crystallographic R (R = Σ‖F o −F c ‖/ΣF o, summed over allh, k, l indexes) value of 0.49. The molecular replacement solution was subjected to rigid body refinement using 8–4 Å data with an overall temperature factor of 15 Å2. Each of the four domains, V H ,C H , V L , and C L (variable and constant domains of heavy and light chains), was allowed to move independently to correct the position of the molecule in the unit cell. After this, R was reduced to 0.38. Next, a positional refinement followed by simulated annealing with a slow-cooling protocol (18Brünger A.T. Krukowski A. Erickson J.W. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1990; 46: 585-593Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar) was carried out using data between 8.0 and 2.8 Å. The Engh and Huber (19Engh R.A. Huber R. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. A. 1991; 47: 392-400Crossref Scopus (2548) Google Scholar) geometric parameters for amino acid residues were used as the basis of the protein force field. At this point, map fitting, using 2F o -F c and F o -F c maps, was used to expand the model to include omitted residues and side chains. Two additional cycles of simulated annealing refinement and map fitting were then carried out. At this stage, residues His136-His140 and 45% of the residue side chains were included, reducing the Rfactor to 0.206. Then an overall temperature factor was refined followed by group temperature factor refinement for each amino acid residue. A number of cycles of map fitting followed by stereochemical restrained least squares refinement were carried out to complete the structure determination producing a final crystallographic Rfactor of 0.195. A summary of the data collection and refinement statistics is presented in Table I. Ten water molecules were included in the model.Table IData collection and refinement statistics of the Fab fragment of the anti-E-selectin 7A9 antibodyStatisticsData collection Space groupP212121 Cell dimensions (a, b, c; Å)44.5, 83.8, 132.5 Resolution (Å)2.8 Number of observed reflections42928 Number of unique reflections10993 Completeness (2.8 Å)86.5% R sym1-aR sym = ∑hk1∥F o ‖–‖F c ∥/∑hk‖‖F o ‖.0.069 <I/ς> at 2.8 Å2.1Refinement Resolution range (Å)8.0–2.8 Reflections9420 R0.195 r.m.s.d.1-br.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. bond lengths (Å)0.015 r.m.s.d. bond angles (°)2.10 r.m.s.d. improper angles (°)1.951-a R sym = ∑hk1∥F o ‖–‖F c ∥/∑hk‖‖F o ‖.1-b r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation. Open table in a new tab Analysis of the stereochemistry of the intermediate and final models was done using the PROCHECK program package (20Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The molecular comparisons were carried out with the ALIGN program (21Satow Y. Cohen G.H. Padlan E.A. Davies D.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 190: 593-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar) using only the CA atom positions of the polypeptide backbone. Surface curvature and electrostatic calculations were performed using the program GRASP (22Nicolls A. Sharp K. Honig B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5318) Google Scholar). The tertiary and quaternary structure of this molecule is consistent with all the crystallographically determined Fab structures. It presents an elbow angle (between the pseudodyad axes relating the V and C domains of the two chains (23Sheriff S. Silverton E. Padlan E.A. Cohen G. Smith-Gill S. Finzel B. Davies D.R. Sarma M. Sarma R.H. Structure and Expression. 1. Adenine Press, New York1988: 449-454Google Scholar)) of 162°, 35° larger than the search model (Fig. 3). The four domains of the Fab are characterized by two β-sheets packed closely against each other with a disulfide bridge connecting them (V L , Cys23-Cys94; V H , Cys22-Cys96; C L , Cys140-Cys200; and C H , Cys147-Cys199). The final coordinates of the Fab fragment consist of 437 amino acid residues, 220 residues for the light chain fragment and 217 residues for the heavy chain. cis-Proline residues occur at positions 8, 101, and 147 of the light chain and positions 154 and 156 of the heavy chain (residue numbering refers to Fig. 2). The final 2F o -F c electron density map, contoured at 1 ς, shows good overall agreement with the structure. The electron density map corresponding to the L3 CDR is shown in Fig. 4. The hydrophobic core of the subunits as well as the interfaces between heavy and light chains are in strong, continuous electron density. The regions of the map corresponding to the CDR loop regions are also well defined except for residues 100–104 at the tip of the H3 CDR loop, where weak density is observed (these residues have been omitted from the final model). Also, the electron density for the distal extremity of the constant region, in particular residues 138–140, is ill defined, and their conformation must be considered as tentative. Side chains of residues 17 and 114 of the light chain and 13, 105, 139, 140, and 194 of the heavy chain show poorly defined electron density and were therefore not modeled beyond CB. The root mean square deviations of coordinates from the stereochemical standards on both bond lengths and angles were 0.015 Å and 2.1°, respectively, and the average temperature factor is 15 Å2. The Ramachandran plot (24Ramakrishnan C. Ramachandran G.N. Biophys. J. 1965; 5: 909-933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar) indicates that the main-chain torsion angles (Φ and Ψ) fall within the energetically favored regions, except for Ala57 of the light chain, that is located in the L2 CDR. This constrained conformation has been reported to occur in other proteins, specifically at the active site (25Herzberg O. Moult J. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The geometry of the side chain dihedral angles was also examined. Nearly all values lie in the expected regions. An analysis of the structure shows that almost 80% of the 437 residues with side chain dihedrals adopt preferred rotamer conformations. Overall, the heavy chain residues have higher average temperature factors than the light chain residues. The variations of residue-averaged temperature factors follow closely the alternating β-strands and loops along the polypeptide chain. The loops at the end of the constant region exposed to the solvent and essentially not involved in crystal packing interactions appeared more flexible, with large temperature factors. The highest B factors are in the solvent exposed loop areas indicating their flexibility and/or partial disorder. At the carboxy ends of both light and heavy chain are regions of unexplained non-continuous density. This could be the result of pepsin digestion and dithiothreitol treatment, indicating different species with different lengths for the carboxy end of the heavy chain. The most interesting feature of the structure is the surface of the antigen combining site that presents an irregular concave surface (Fig. 5). Currently it is known that five out of the six hypervariable loops that form the antigen-binding site are limited to a few main-chain conformations (canonical) (26Chothia C. Lesk A.M. Tramontano A. Levitt M. Smith-Gill S.J. Air G. Sheriff S. Padlan E.A. Davies D. Tulip W.R. Colman P.M. Spinelly S. Alzari P.M. Poljak R.M. Nature. 1989; 342: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (1084) Google Scholar). These conformations can be predicted by the size of the CDR and the occurrence of a specific set of residues that produce a known conformation. Recent studies (27Vargas-Madrazo E. Lara-Ochoa F. Almagro J.C. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 497-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) indicate that antibodies exhibit a surprisingly small number of combinations of canonical structures. Moreover, it has been shown (28MacCallum R.M. Martin A.C.R. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1996; 262: 732-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) that the shapes allowed by these combinations correlate, in some cases, with the type of antigens with which the antibody interacts. Four different groups of antibody-antigen topographies have been distinguished: concave (for small haptens), moderately concave, grooves (for peptides and carbohydrates), and planar (for proteins). The CDRs of 7A9 are canonical: the L1 CDR belongs to the canonical group 3, the L2 CDR to group 1, the L3 CDR to group 1, the H1 CDR to group 1 and the H2 CDR to group 2. No canonical groups have been identified for the H3 CDR (29Kabat E.A. Wu T.T. Reid-Miller M. Perry H.M. Gottesman K. 4th Ed. Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest. National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD1987: 210-225Google Scholar). Then it belongs to the class 1-2-3-1-1. Major conclusions drawn from the analysis of the surface of the combining site are that this antibody displays a groove found at the interface between the heavy and light chain variable domains and that L1 CDR points out into the solvent (Fig. 5). Residues from the six CDRs and framework residues form the floor and walls of the groove. This groove is approximately 22 Å wide and 8 Å deep, and it is lined with many aromatic residues. It is worth mentioning that 8F5 is the only antibody of known three-dimensional structure, that belongs to the same canonical class, 1-2-3-1-1, and displays a similar groove in the combining site (17Tormo J. Stadler E. Skern T. Auer H. Kanzler O. Betzel C. Blaas D. Fita I. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1154-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). This type of topography has been observed for peptide binding antibodies Since the lectin activity of E-selectin is abolished when it combines the 7A9 Fab, it is possible that the loop containing the amino acid residues that are essential for the activity (Tyr94 and Arg97) could partially fit this Fab groove at the combining site. Similar topography has been observed also for other antireceptor antibodies, like the anti-ICAM-1 antibody (6Jedrzejas M.J. Miglietta J. Griffin J.A. Luo M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1995; 51: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), or those that bind peptides, in particular peptides that adopt a β-turn conformation (30Shoham M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1169-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 shows the CA superposition for the variable fragments (Fv) of the three antibodies, 7A9, and R6.5 (Protein Data Bank code 1RMF) (6Jedrzejas M.J. Miglietta J. Griffin J.A. Luo M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1995; 51: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) directed against cell receptors E-selectin and ICAM-1, and the Fv of the anti-human rhinovirus 85F (Protein Data Bank code 1BBD) (17Tormo J. Stadler E. Skern T. Auer H. Kanzler O. Betzel C. Blaas D. Fita I. Protein Sci. 1992; 1: 1154-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), used for the molecular replacement analysis. The combining sites of 7A9 and 8F5 belong to the same canonical class, while R6.5 has an extra residue in the L1 CDR and belongs to class 1-2-4-1-1. Structurally it is clear that these Fv fragments are remarkably similar. For the V L domain, the main differences can be appreciated in the L1 CDR loops, due mainly to differences in length. However, in the three structures, this loop is pointing into the solvent. A greater variation is observed for theV H domain. At this stage of the refinement, we cannot conclude anything concerning H3 CDR because we could not find clear density for the five residues at the tip of the loop. On the other hand, this is the most variable loop among antibodies. The conformation of H2 CDR is very similar for 7A9 and 8F5; however, R6.5 shows a conformation not observed before for this type of region. It is possible that this loop had been incorrectly built (31Martin A.C.R. Thornton J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 263: 800-815Crossref Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Evidently, the topology of the binding site is approximately the same, despite some slight differences in the conformation of some loops. To stress this fact, the molecular surface of 7A9 and R6.5 Fabs is shown in Fig. 6. Clearly, both antibodies present a groove at the antigen binding site. The feature most frequently observed in antibody-peptide complex structures is a β-turn in the peptide that is embedded in the antibody-antigen interface. Several examples of this recognition motif have been described to date and include a type I β-turn, reported for the VP2 peptide in complex with 8F5 (32Tormo J. Dieter B. Parry N.R. Rowlands D. Stuart D. Fita I. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2247-2256Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and a type II β-turn for the HIV-1 peptide (gp120) in the 59.1 complex (33Ghiara J.B. Stura E.A. Stanfield R.L. Profy A.T. Wilson I.A. Science. 1994; 264: 82-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Shoham (30Shoham M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1169-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) had suggested that antipeptide antibodies seemed to induce a β-turn conformation in the bound peptide, irrespective of the peptide sequences. However secondary structure predictions for the sequences have shown that they have a tendency to form the turn types found in the Fab-peptide structures. Therefore, it would be expected for these peptides to mimic their protein counterparts (30Shoham M. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 1169-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 34Rini J.M. Stanfield R.L. Stura E.A. Salinas P.A. Profy A.T. Wilson I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6325-6329Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 35Shulze-Gahmen U. Rini J.M. Wilson I.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 1098-1118Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In 1995, Tormo et al. (36Tormo J. Centeno N.B. Fontana E. Bubendorfer T. Fita I. Blaas D. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1995; 23: 491-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) reported a model for 8F5 IgG docked onto the viral surface through the peptide in VP2, which adopted the same conformation. On the other hand, Jedrzejas et al. (6Jedrzejas M.J. Miglietta J. Griffin J.A. Luo M. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1995; 51: 380-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) proposed that R6.5 could bind ICAM-1 through a β-turn in domains D1 or D2."
