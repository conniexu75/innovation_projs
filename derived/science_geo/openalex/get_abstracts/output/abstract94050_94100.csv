https://openalex.org/W1567345519,"Using principles developed by Kacser and Burns ((1973) in Rate Control of Biological Processes (Davies, D. D., ed) pp. 65-104, Cambridge University Press, London) and Heinrich and Rapoport ((1974) Eur. J. Biochem. 42, 97-105), inhibitor titration studies were carried out in order to quantify the amount of control (control strength) exerted by different steps in oxidative phosphorylation on the rate of mitochondrial oxygen uptake. In the resting state of respiration, nearly all control is exerted by the passive permeability of the mitochondrial inner membrane to protons. In the intermediate states and even in the active state of respiration, control is distributed among different steps including the adenine nucleotide translocator and cytochrome c oxidase. It is therefore not possible to speak of the rate-limiting step in oxidative phosphorylation. Since both the adenine nucleotide translocator and cytochrome c oxidase appear to be rate-controlling, hypotheses suggesting that respiration is fully controlled by either of these two steps alone need to be modified."

The effect of the eight major tunicamycin homologues on protein glycosylation and protein biosynthesis was examined. All homologues tested inhibited lipid-mediated protein glycosylation in chick or mouse fibroblasts. These homologues also inhibited the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphate from UDP-N-acetylglucosamine to dolichyl phosphate in chick liver microsome preparations, whereas the transfer of mannose from GDP-mannose to the lipid acceptor was hardly affected. The inhibition of protein glycosylation in fibroblasts or in microsomal preparations was concentration-dependent and maximum inhibition occurred at different concentrations for different homologues. The eight homologues differed in their ability to cause inhibition of protein synthesis."

https://openalex.org/W1666357690,"To explore how mitochondria can respire at high physiological, extramitochondrial phosphorylation potentials, two series of experiments were conducted. In the first, intact rat liver mitochondria were incubated in oxygraph medium containing 5 mM succinate (+rotenone), 1.0 mM ATP, 20 mM glucose, pH 7.2, at 37 degrees C. Yeast hexokinase (0.02 to 1.0 IU) was added to establish steady state rates of respiration. Samples were removed, assayed for ATP, ADP, and Pi content, and ratios were calculated. As previously reported, low rates of respiration were observed at high phosphorylation potential ([ATP]/[ADP] x [Pi]) or [ATP]/[ADP] ratio values, and the rates of respiration increased as these values declined. In a second series of experiments, only sufficient hexokinase was added to potentially stimulate respiration to 90% of the ADP State 3 rate. At constant hexokinase, 0.35 IU, ATP (5 microM to 10.0 mM) was titrated into the medium to establish steady state rates of oxygen consumption. Under these conditions, low rates of respiration correlated with low [ATP]/[ADP] ratios and extramitochondrial phosphorylation potentials, while maximum rates of respiration were observed at high values of these ratios, the opposite of the previous experimental case. Therefore, it may be concluded that these extramitochondrial parameters per se exert little or no regulatory influence on the rates of respiration, and thus matrix ATP synthesis. In both cases, the concentrations of ADP correlated with respiratory rates. Double reciprocal plots were used to estimate the apparent KmADP for respiratory stimulation. The values are 56 microM for constant [ATP] and 15 microM at constant hexokinase. The value calculated from direct ADP pulses was 25 microM. Together, these results suggest that the most plausible explanation of respiratory control is the availability of ADP and the kinetics of its transport by the adenine nucleotide translocase, a hypothesis first proposed by Chance and Williams more than 25 years ago (Chance, B., and Williams, G. R. (1955) J. Biol. Chem. 217, 385-393)."
https://openalex.org/W1533929654,"We have characterized the oligosaccharide chains of the alpha subunit of acetylcholine receptor of the clonal mouse muscle cell line BC3H-1 by their sensitivity to end-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H and by comparison of the native glycosylated polypeptide with the nonglycosylated form made in tunicamycin-treated cells. These studies indicate that the native alpha subunit has a single N-asparagine-linked oligosaccharide chain of the high mannose or simple type. Furthermore, these results considered in light of our previous characterization of the alpha subunit synthesized in vitro suggest that the alpha subunit contains no complex-type N-linked oligosaccharide chains. We have investigated the role of glycosylation in the biogenesis of the acetylcholine receptor. Receptor biogenesis in normal cells involves the assembly of newly synthesized alpha subunits into a form active for binding alpha-bungarotoxin. This process is only 30% efficient and is complete by 30 min postsynthesis. When glycosylation is inhibited by tunicamycin, alpha subunit synthesis is inhibited only slightly but assembly into an alpha-bungarotoxin binding species is reduced dramatically."
https://openalex.org/W1929979613,"Two constitutive forms of cytochrome P-450 isozymes, designated RLM3 and RLM5, have been purified from untreated rat liver microsomes. RLM3 and RLM5 have minimum molecular weights of 50,000 and 51,000, respectively, based on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Absolute oxidized spectra indicate that RLM3 is essentially all in the low spin state, whereas RLM5 contains some high spin component. The CO-reduced difference spectral maximum of RLM3 is at 449 nm and RLM5 is at 451 nm. RLM3 preferentially hydroxylates testosterone at 6 beta and 7 alpha positions and forms an even higher amount of an as yet unidentified polar metabolite, whereas RLM5 hydroxylates testosterone preferentially at 2 beta and 16 alpha positions, and exhibits 6 beta-hydroxylase activity similar to RLM3. RLM5 metabolizes aminopyrine, ethylmorphine, and benzphetamine all faster than does RLM3. When RLM3 and RLM5 were digested with proteolytic enzymes, peptide maps showed that these two cytochrome P-450 isozymes have different primary structures. Cyanogen bromide digestion breaks both isozymes into fragments too small to compare on polyacrylamide gels. Amino acid analyses indicate that RLM3 and RLM5 have very similar but not identical compositions. NH2-terminal residues were determined by Edman degradation and high pressure liquid chromatography separation of phenylthiohydantoin-derivatives. The first four residues of both enzymes are identical, NH2-Met-Asp-Pro-Val, but the fifth residue of RLM5 is -Leu-while that of RLM3 is -Val-. These sequences differ dramatically from all other P-450 isozymes reported to date."
https://openalex.org/W1527521373,"To explore the nature of retinyl ester synthesis by liver microsomes, membranes prepared from rat or cat liver were incubated under various conditions with [3H] retinol dispersed in dimethyl sulfoxide. When [3H]retinol, buffer, and microsomes were incubated together (basal conditions), some [3H]retinol esterification was consistently observed. However, the rate of esterification could be increased 6- to 11-fold by addition of either palmitoyl-CoA (100 microM) or a fatty acyl CoA-generating system. To determine whether the fatty acid used to esterify [3H]retinol under basal conditions might be derived from an endogenous pool of fatty acyl-CoA associated with the microsomal preparation, microsomes were pretreated at pH 7.4 with 0.5 M hydroxylamine, a reagent that reacts with coenzyme A thioesters to form hydroxamates. This pretreatment reduced the basal reaction by 69%. However, hydroxylamine-treated microsomes still retained acyltransferase activity, as shown by a 24- to 40-fold increase in retinyl ester synthesis after addition of palmitoyl-CoA. When microsomes were incubated with both [3H]retinol and [14C]palmitoyl-CoA of known specific radioactivities, the ratio of 14C to 3H in newly synthesized retinyl palmitate was essentially equal to that of its putative substrates, indicating that [14C]palmitate did not undergo significant isotope dilution prior to acylation of [3H]retinol. These experiments provide direct evidence for retinol esterification catalyzed by a microsomal acyl-CoA:retinol acyltransferase and indirect evidence for a pool of fatty acyl-CoA in isolated liver microsomes that is available to react with [3H]retinol to form esterified retinol."
https://openalex.org/W1617855752,"The thermodynamics of adsorption of four acidic proline-rich salivary proteins from their aqueous solutions onto hydroxyapatite (HA) and fluorapatite (FA) have been analyzed. Enthalpies and entropies of adsorption were derived from isotherms at 37 degrees C and 4 degrees C and led to the unexpected conclusion that adsorption of the macromolecules studied is an endothermic process. Consequently, adsorption is driven by an increase in entropy. Most of this increase originates in the adsorbate molecules, probably through disruption of internal ion pairs, hydrogen bonds, and displacement of water molecules. Integral free energies of adsorption (delta G) and the partial contributions of adsorbent and adsorbate were both calculated as a function of the adsorption coverages. For equal coverages (of each adsorbate), delta G is lower with FA than with HA. Most of the contribution to delta G originates from the adsorbate, although the adsorbent contribution becomes significant as adsorption saturation is approached. The differences in the various thermodynamic quantities are qualitatively related to the known structural features of the four proteins. The results are important in understanding the role played by the proline-rich proteins in the oral environment."

https://openalex.org/W1529198223,"The synthesis of hyaluronic acid by cultured chondrocytes from the Swarm rat chondrosarcoma was examined using [3H]glucosamine as a precursor. [3H]Hyaluronate in samples was estimated as the specific unsaturated disaccharide released by incubation with chondroitinase ABC under conditions where all [3H]hyaluronate was converted to disaccharide even in the presence of excess chondroitin sulfate. The products of digestion of chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronate were well separated by cellulose thin layer chromatography. A second method involving quantitation of the 3H-oligosaccharides released by digestion with Streptomyces hyaluronidase gave nearly identical results. [3H]Hyaluronate formed about 12% of the [3H]glycosaminoglycans synthesized by the chondrocytes, although levels as high as 20% were found in one set of cultures. The incorporation of [3H]glucosamine into chondroitin sulfate and hyaluronate was linear and at a constant ratio over a 24-h period. The distributions of [35S]proteoglycans, [3H]chondroitin sulfate, and [3H]hyaluronate between the medium, a 4.0 M guanidine HCl extract of the cell layer, and the cell residue, were investigated over 24 h. Both hyaluronate and proteoglycan accumulated in the medium with little retention in the cell layer. Pulse-chase experiments indicated that a greater proportion of the [3H]hyaluronate than the [3H]chondroitin sulfate was initially retained in the cells, but that subsequently [3H]hyaluronate accumulated more rapidly in the medium, suggesting differences in the transit time through the extracellular matrix for the two molecules once secreted from the cell. In cultures labeled for 6 h, 4.0 M guanidine HCl extracted 66% of the hyaluronate and 58% of the chondroitin sulfate associated with the cell layer, while 1% Zwittergent, a zwitterionic detergent, extracted 59% and 29%, respectively. The selective extraction with detergent suggests that there is a pool of hyaluronate in the cell layer which is not associated with proteoglycan aggregates. Equilibrium density gradient centrifugation of cell layer extracts and culture media, under dissociative conditions, showed that 89% of the [3H]hyaluronate banded at densities between 1.43-1.55 g/ml with a peak at 1.47 g/ml. Disaccharide analyses of the gradient fractions showed that the main proteoglycan component contained primarily chondroitin 4-sulfate but also revealed a minor proteoglycan at lower densities which was considerably enriched in chondroitin 6-sulfate."

https://openalex.org/W1595165457,"Evidence of several types has accumulated that cytochrome P-450 has a thiolate anion as one of the axial ligands to heme (the fifth ligand). On the other hand, there is as yet no general agreement on the nature of the axial ligand trans to thiolate (the sixth ligand), although nitrogen and oxygen have been proposed. To resolve the controversy, the ligand exchange reactions of cytochrome P-450 were investigated by the use of optical spectroscopy. Two isozymes of rabbit liver microsomal cytochrome P-450 were examined: the isozyme induced by phenobarbital (P-450LM2), which has a sixth ligand and is low spin and the isozyme induced by 5,6-benzoflavone (P-450LM4), which is without a sixth ligand and is high spin. A series of artificial ligands was chosen to model the coordination of each of the potential native ligands, including water and certain amino acid residues. When the artificial ligand coordinated through an oxygen atom, the spectrum of pentacoordinate P-450LM4 changed to one closely resembling that of native, hexacoordinate P-450LM2. The spectrum of P-450LM2 was unchanged in the presence of oxygen-coordinating ligands. However, when artificial ligands which coordinate through nitrogen or sulfur were added to either P-450LM2 or P-450LM4, the induced spectra did not resemble the native spectrum and, in fact, were distinctive and characteristic of the particular ligand type. With three of the artificial ligands, 1-butanol, 1-benzylimidazole, and diethylphenylphosphine, the binding was found to be reversible by dilution, ultrafiltration, or gel filtration. The binding of 1-pentanol and 1-benzylimidazole was competitive, as expected for heme ligands, and the number of 1-benzylimidazole binding sites per molecule of P-450LM2 was estimated as 1.1. These results provide strong evidence that the native sixth ligand in P-450LM2 is oxygen rather than nitrogen."
https://openalex.org/W1576318030,"The divalent cation Mg2+ binds specifically and tightly to a specific site on rabbit muscle G-actin, and it has been shown previously that such binding involves a conformational change in the monomeric actin as measured by a time-dependent change in the fluorescence of G-actin labeled with the fluorescent probe N-iodoacetyl N'-(5-sulfo-1-naphthyl)ethylenediamine (Frieden, C., Lieberman, D., and Gilbert, H. R. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 8991-8993). The characteristics of specific Mg2+-induced conformational changes using this labeled G-actin have been examined. The data are consistent with an initial poor binding of Mg2+ followed by an isomerization process resulting in tight binding. Mg2+ and Ca2+ compete for this site and the isomerization induced by Mg2+ can be reversed with high Ca2+ concentrations. The overall dissociation constant for Mg2+ binding is highly pH-sensitive, becoming larger with decreasing pH, implying that ionizable groups may control Mg2+ and Ca2+ binding and that these cations bind preferentially to the unprotonated form. Mg2+ binding to this site increases the off rate constant of the tightly bound ATP relative to Ca2+ by about 6-fold. It is suggested that Mg2+ binding to this site may be related to hydrolysis of the ATP."
https://openalex.org/W1588166591,"Seventeen hours after a single oral dose of the cyclic monoterpenes cineole or menthol, rat liver 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity was inhibited by up to 70%. The transient nature of this effect (no inhibition 41 h after dosing) was compatible with the rapid metabolism and excretion of these terpenes. Neither menthol, and its major metabolite, menthylglucuronide, nor cineole acted as direct inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase activity in vitro, although menthol was found to bind to liver microsomes Ks approximately 0.1 mM). Unlike the short term effects of dietary cholesterol, terpene administration did not affect HMG-CoA reductase activity by modulation of the lipid microenvironment of the enzyme. Thus, following menthol or cineole treatment, we found no deviations from the normal kinetic responses to changes in temperature or in concentration of HMG-CoA. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect was still seen after solubilization of the enzyme from microsomes. The loss of HMG-CoA reductase activity was not associated with increased phosphorylation of the enzyme. Immunotitration of HMG-CoA reductase from terpene-treated rats showed that activity loss was due to less enzyme molecules (together with some possibly cripple enzyme), indicating that rates of enzyme synthesis or degradation had been altered. Since menthol inhibition of reductase was still observed in rats deprived of foods, we conclude that the effect is not mediated by those hormones whose concentration is changed during fasting (insulin, glucagon, and adrenaline)."
https://openalex.org/W1585996643,"The technique of deuterium magnetic resonance was used to study the orientational order of the perdeuterated acyl chains of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC-d54) reconstituted with rhodopsin between 0 and 23 degrees C. This range includes the gel to liquid crystalline phase transition of DMPC-d54 at 20 degrees C. Molar lipid/protein (L/P) ratios of L/P = infinity, 150, 50, 30, and 12 were investigated. Measurements of orientational order parameters showed that the addition of rhodopsin broadened the range of the gel to liquid crystalline transition for L/P = 150 and 50. No transition was observed for L/P = 30 and 12. Moment analysis and spectral subtraction both showed that the low temperature spectra for L/P greater than 30 had two components. One was a pure phospholipid gel phase spectrum and the other a spectrum attributed to lipids in protein aggregates. The intensity of the second component corresponded to 30 lipids/protein and its shape was the same as the temperature-independent shape observed for L/P = 30 and 12. No such decomposition into two components was possible in the liquid crystalline phase for L/P greater than 30. Extraction of the oriented 2H NMR spectrum from its powder spectrum showed that the presence of proteins does not modify the distribution of quadrupole splittings but does produce both homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening. The latter may be related to the heterogeneity seen in the spectra of electron paramagnetic resonance spin labels above the gel to liquid crystalline transition."
https://openalex.org/W1562893845,"Decreased rates of protein synthesis which occurred in rat livers perfused with amino acid-deficient medium were accompanied by a loss of polysomes and a doubling of concentrations of ribosomal subunits and monomers as compared to unperfused liver or livers perfused with amino acid-supplemented medium. The loss of polysomes was not the result of mRNA degradation because this effect could be reversed by addition of amino acids to the perfusion medium. Instead, loss of polysomes indicated an impairment in peptide chain initiation. To determine whether the block of initiation could be the result of sequestration of mRNA in untranslatable pools, the content of albumin mRNA in membrane-bound and free polysomes and in the non-polysomal fraction isolated on sucrose density gradients was determined by hybridization to an albumin cDNA. In livers perfused with an amino acid-supplemented medium, 90% of the albumin mRNA was found in bound polysomes, and with amino acid-deficient medium, this value was decreased to 80%. Thus, there was no indication of a significant pool of mRNA which was not being translated. The block of initiation was, however, accompanied by a marked change in density and methionine-binding characteristics of the 40 S ribosomal subunit in livers perfused with deficient medium as compared to livers perfused with supplemented medium or to unperfused livers. There was a relative loss of 40 S subunits in a low density form, 1.41 g/cm3, an increase in the proportion in a high density form, 1.48 g/cm3, and a decrease in binding of [35S]methionine to 40 S ribosomal subunits. These changes provide evidence of reduced rates of formation of the 40 S initiation complex."
https://openalex.org/W1896307881,"Effects of RNA and ribonucleases on the binding of estrogen- and glucocorticoid-receptor complexes from MCF-7 cells to calf thymus DNA-cellulose have been studied under cell-free conditions. Exogenous ribonucleases can increase binding of estrogen- and glucocorticoid-receptor complexes to DNA-cellulose. Purified RNA derived from MCF-7 cells can inhibit estrogen- and glucocorticoid-receptor binding to DNA-cellulose. Under low salt conditions, RNA appears to be associated with estrogen-receptor complexes from MCF-7 cells. These observations taken together suggest that there is an interaction between steroid hormone-receptor complexes and RNA. The implications of this interaction are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1508760371,"The mechanism of synthesis of dolichol-linked saccharides has been examined using sealed hen oviduct microsomes. N,N'-Diacetylchitobiosylpyrophosphoryldolichol (chitobiosyl-lipid) was shown to be inaccessible to a soluble galactosyltransferase during its synthesis from UDP-GlcNac. In contrast, exogenous chitobiosyl-lipid added to microsomes is accessible to galactosyltransferase and does not appear to be unidirectionally translocated to the lumen. These results imply that assembly of chitobiosyl-lipid does not occur on the cytoplasmic face of the rough endoplasmic reticulum followed by a rapid unidirectional translocation to the lumen. Two lines of evidence rule out sugar nucleotide uptake and utilization within the lumen as a mechanism for chitobiosyl-lipid synthesis. GDP-mannose, which is involved in the elongation of chitobiosyl-lipid to form oligosaccharide-lipid, also does not permeate microsomal vesicles. This observation regarding GDP-mannose raises two important questions. 1) What is the topology of the oligosaccharide in sealed microsomes? and 2) how is the chitobiosyl-lipid elongated by addition of mannosyl units to form an oligosaccharide-lipid? During the synthesis of oligosaccharide-lipid in freeze-thawed microsomes, approximately 40% of the oligosaccharide is released from the lipid by hydrolysis and remains entrapped within the sealed microsomes. These data suggest that oligosaccharide-lipid is transiently present at the luminal face of the rough endoplasmic reticulum during its synthesis. Most of the enzymes involved in the synthesis of oligosaccharide-lipid can be inactivated by external proteolysis of microsomal vesicles. These data are discussed in terms of a model in which synthesis of chitobiosyl-lipid and its elongation to oligosaccharide-lipid are coupled processes that occur in a transmembrane multienzyme complex."

https://openalex.org/W1507844821,"Histone acetylation in Tetrahymena macro- and micronuclei has been studied utilizing a combination of electrophoretic and autoradiographic techniques. Histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 are acetylated to varying extents in the transcriptionally active macronucleus. There are few, if any, acetylated subspecies of these histones in the transcriptionally inert micronucleus, and micronuclei incorporate little radioactive acetate, either in vivo or in isolated nuclei. Butyrate is shown to inhibit histone deacetylation in Tetrahymena, both in vivo and in isolated nuclei. Incorporation of acetate into micronuclei is unaffected by high concentrations of this inhibitor, indicating that the extremely low levels of histone acetylation observed in micronuclei are not due to rapid deacylation but probably result from the absence of histone acetylation. We also present evidence that macronuclear core histones are composed of at least two classes of molecules distinguishable on the basis of their acetate turnover rates and that individual histone species differ in the distribution of their populations between these classes."
https://openalex.org/W1521887751,"The mouse metallothionein I (MT-I) gene is regulated by both heavy metals and glucocorticoid hormones. We selected cadmium-resistant variants of the mouse sarcoma cell line, S180, in which the metallothionein I gene has been amplified 10-fold and found that the amplified genes are regulated by cadmium in a manner identical with that observed for the original MT-I gene in unselected S180 cells. However, the amplified metallothionein I genes appear to be essentially nonresponsive to glucocorticoids even though at least 18 kilobases of DNA flanking the 5' side of the metallothionein I gene are amplified in these cells. The same result has been observed in nine clonal lines derived from the cadmium-resistant (CdR) population. The implications of this result both for models of steroid hormone action and for gene evolution are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1595797530,"Human platelets were labeled with tracer doses of [14C]arachidonic acid, then fractionated into mixed membranes which are separated into intracellular membranes and two different domains of surface membranes by high voltage free flow electrophoresis. Each subfraction was analyzed for its phospholipid content. Glycerophospholipids were separated by high performance liquid chromatography and their fatty acids analyzed by glass capillary gas chromatography. Intracellular membranes appeared substantially depleted in sphingomyelin, while enrichment of this phospholipid was seen in surface membranes. PC and PI were more enriched in intracellular membranes than in the surface membranes and the contrary was observed for PE. On the other hand, the pattern of the phospholipid labeling by [14C]arachidonate followed closely the glycerophospholipid profiles of the membrane subfractions, but the specific radioactivity of PI was higher than of PC, which itself was higher than that of PE. Moreover, the endogenous content of arachidonic acid accentuates these tendencies. The percentage of arachidonate in PE was higher in the surface membranes than in the intracellular membranes and the contrary was observed for arachidonyl-PC and PI. These differences were compensated for by certain saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids present in the composition profiles. These findings are discussed in relation to the membrane localization of lipases involved in the liberation of arachidonic acid for prostanoid synthesis."

Halorhodopsin was reconstituted in these membranes with tritium-labeled retinal and the preparation was reduced with sodium cyanoborohydride. The product was a bleached pigment in which the retinal-protein bond was resistant to hydroxylamine cleavage. Fluorography of sodium dodecyl sulfate/urea-polyacrylamide gels showed that one protein was radioactively labeled, almost exclusively. This protein migrated with an apparent molecular weight somewhat lower than that of bacteriorhodopsin, which was reconstituted in membranes from another strain and radioactively labeled under the same conditions. Thus, the retinal-binding component of halorhodopsin is a small protein, with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 25,000."
https://openalex.org/W1494576426,"Reductive methylation of hen egg-white (HEW) lysozyme with [13C]formaldehyde and NaCNBH3 and subsequent 13C NMR spectroscopy reveal resonances for each of the mono- and dimethyl derivatives of the six lysyl epsilon-amino groups and the NH2 terminus. Each resonance has a unique chemical shift, pKa, and chemical shift change upon deprotonation. The assignment of the resonances arising from the N alpha,N-dimethyl and N alpha-monomethyl NH2 terminus has been made as have resonance assignments for the two lysyl residues which crystallographic studies indicate are involved in ion pair interactions (Imoto, T., Johnson, L. N., North, A. C. T., Phillips, D. C., and Rupley, J. A. (1972) in The Enzymes (Boyer, P. D., ed) 3rd Ed, Vol. 7, pp. 665-868, Academic Press, New York). One resonance, tentatively assigned to the lysine 1 (epsilon NH3+) which forms an ion pair with glutamic acid 7 (gamma COO-), has a highly perturbed chemical shift which shows a biphasic titration curve (N epsilon, N-dimethyl pKa values 10.0 and 2.6). A similar titration curve is observed for a N epsilon-monomethyl lysyl residue. The resonance for lysine 13 (epsilon NH3+), which forms an ion pair with the carboxyl terminus, leucine 129 (alpha COO-), has been assigned by removal of leucine 129 with carboxypeptidase whereupon only one pair of mono- and dimethyl lysyl resonances is greatly perturbed. The pKa of N epsilon,N-dimethyl lysine 13 is 9.3 in des-Arg-Leu-lysozyme in contrast to 9.8 for the intact enzyme. Thus, it appears that both of the intramolecular ion pairs predicted by x-ray crystallography exist in the solution structure of HEW lysozyme."
https://openalex.org/W1522770871,"A photogenerated carbene, 3-trifluoromethyl-3-(m-[125I]iodophenyl)carbene (Brunner, J., and Semenza G. (1981) Biochemistry, 20, 7174-7182), was used to label the hydrophobic core of small intestinal brush-order membrane vesicles. Reaction of the carbene with sucrase-isomaltase complex was restricted to a polypeptide segment which is essential for binding the enzyme complex to the native membrane or to liposomes. The same labeling selectivity was obtained when purified sucrase-isomaltase complex was labeled either in Triton X-100 solution or when it was incorporated in egg-lecithin liposomes. During cleavage of sucrase-isomaltase with papain, the radiolabel remained covalently associated with the anchor peptide. It was thus possible to detect easily the polypeptide in the course of subsequent separation and purification operations. The molecular weight of the peptide was determined by gel filtration on Sephadex LH-60 in ethanol-formic acid (Takagaki, Y., Gerber, G. E., Nihei, K., and Khorana, H. G. (1980) J. Biol. Chem. 255, 1536-1541). The figure thereby obtained, 6500, is somewhat lower than that obtained from sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (approximately 8000). Circular dichroism of the peptide indicates a secondary structure of high alpha-helical content. A possible structure of the membranous segment is discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1517218866,"It has been postulated that hyperlipidemia in the nephrotic syndrome is due to overproduction of lipoproteins and that low colloid osmotic pressure (due to hypoalbuminemia) triggers this. Secretion of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) by cultured rat hepatocytes has been shown to be inhibited by albumin, globulins, and dextrans, but the effect did not correlate with osmolarity. In the present studies we tested the hypothesis that viscosity rather than osmolarity might be the parameter determining the effectiveness of macromolecules in inhibiting VLDL synthesis and secretion by cultured rat hepatocytes. Synthesis and secretion of VLDL was measured in terms of incorporation of [3H] glycerol into medium triglycerides and also from changes in the mass of secreted VLDL triglycerides and apoproteins. The viscosity of the culture medium was increased by addition of dextran-500, gelatin or methylcellulose MX 880. Synthesis and secretion of VLDL was inhibited in direct proportion to increasing viscosity. At a viscosity of 2, which is about that of normal plasma, VLDL secretion was reduced by 20%. An inhibition of 60-70% in secretion and 30-40% in synthesis of VLDL lipid and protein components was observed at a relative viscosity of approximately 3.7. This viscosity was obtained by addition of any of the following: 3% dextran, 3% gelatin, 0.2% methylcellulose, or a combination of 0.1% methylcellulose plus 2% gelatin. Thus, similar viscosities resulted in similar degrees of inhibition despite differences of up to 16-fold in mass concentration and up to 20-fold in osmolarity."
https://openalex.org/W1548921660,"The regulation of the activity of transport System L for neutral amino acids has been investigated in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Incubation of the temperature-sensitive leucyl-tRNA synthetase mutant CHO-tsH1 at marginally permissive temperatures results in leucine-limited growth and increased transport of branched chain and aromatic amino acids. This temperature-dependent transport enhancement is restricted to transport System L and results in increased Vmax values of uptake of System L substrates with unchanged Km values of uptake. Several lines of evidence suggest that trans-stimulation by intracellular amino acids cannot account for the increased System L activity in CHO-tsH1. Other temperature-sensitive aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase mutants of the Chinese hamster ovary line show increased transport of the amino acid corresponding to the synthetase defect after incubation at elevated temperatures. Increased transport by System L occurs in CHO-S, the parental line of CHO-tsH1, after growth in limiting levels of leucine. The System L enhancement can be prevented by cycloheximide but not, at early times, by actinomycin D. We conclude that the activity of transport System L in Chinese hamster ovary cells is regulated by a mechanism which appears to act at the level of translation."
https://openalex.org/W1545685256,"Highly purified acidic (pI 4.9) and basic (pI 8.7) phospholipases A2 from snake (Agkistrodon halys blomhoffii) venom hydrolyzed approximately 20% and 60%, respectively, of the phosphatidylcholine (PC) of intact human erythrocytes prior to hemolysis. Sequential use of the acidic enzyme followed by the basic phospholipase A2 or vice versa manifested a characteristic PC hydrolysis pattern. For example, when acidic enzyme had hydrolyzed nearly 20% of this substrate, a subsequent treatment with the basic enzyme hydrolyzed only an additional 40% of the PC before hemolysis. On the other hand, in experiments where hydrolysis of about 20% of PC of erythrocytes was achieved by a short term incubation with the basic enzyme, then a further treatment of the same cells with the acidic enzyme caused only 10% additional PC hydrolysis before hemolysis. This demonstrated that the acidic enzyme hydrolyzed one domain of PC in the intact erythrocytes, whereas the basic enzyme hydrolyzed not only the same but also another domain of PC in membranes. Analysis of fatty acids released by the action of these two phospholipases A2 on erythrocytes indicated further characteristic differences. In particular, the ratio of released saturated to unsaturated fatty acids was significantly higher with the acidic enzyme as compared with the basic phospholipase A2. These results provide firm support to the conclusion that there are different domains of PC in human erythrocyte membranes and that the acidic and basic phospholipase A2 of A. halys blomhoffii can be used to identify them."
https://openalex.org/W1587512277,"Human red blood cell hexokinase (EC 2.7.1.1) has been shown to exist in multiple molecular forms which are separable by ion exchange chromatography. Of the major forms, designated hexokinase Ia, Ib, and Ic, only hexokinase Ia corresponds to hexokinase type I from human liver, while the others differ from every other previously reported hexokinase isozyme. Hexokinase Ib is the predominant form in the fetal erythrocytes, while it is present at lower levels in the red blood cells of adults. Analysis of the hexokinase isozymic pattern in red cells of different mean age shows that the level of hexokinase Ib is also dependent on the age of the cell. The three major forms of hexokinase have the same molecular weight of 100,000, by sedimentation velocity on sucrose density gradients, the same Michaelis constants, substrate and coenzyme specificity, pH-dependent activity, and the same thermal stability. The only significant differences were found in the isoelectric points which were 5.7 pH units for hexokinase Ia, 5.5 pH units for hexokinase Ib, and 5.35 pH units for hexokinase Ic. These data, together with that previously reported for rabbit erythrocytes (Stocchi, V., Magnani, M., Canestrari, F., Dacha, M., and Fornaini, G. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 7856-7861) suggest that the presence of multiple forms of hexokinase is a common phenomenon in mammalian red blood cells."
https://openalex.org/W1532452840,"Immunochemical activity of the Arachis hypogaea lectin has been equated, in spite of its different hapten combining requirements, with that of the human anti-T (Thomsen-Friedenreich) antibody population which is of importance in cancer immunology. We show here by gradual desialation of isolated human blood group MM and NN antigens at pH 2.0, 56 degrees C, that A. hypogaea lectin is, in addition, substantially more tolerant to NeuAc in the vicinity of T antigen's immunodominant repeating structures, Gal beta 1 leads to 3 GalNAc, than human anti-T antibodies. Reactivity with the Arachis lectin appeared first at 20-25% release of NeuAc from the antigens, whereas faint reactivity with anti-T was first recognizable at 50-55% NeuAc release from NN and 65-70% from MM antigen. Remarkably, at these degrees of desialation, the NN and MM antigens had about 50% of maximal activity toward the Arachis lectin. The slower appearance of T antigen upon graded desialation of MM antigen is likely due to the higher concentration of NeuAc and difference in some of its linkages on intact MM as compared to NN antigen."

Manganese prevented accurate transcription, but it was essential for expression of the stimulatory activity of S-II. The results indicate that protein(s) cross-reacting immunologically with S-II in a HeLa cell lysate is essential for accurate transcription of truncated DNA, but the stimulatory activity of this factor(s) is not necessary for accurate transcription of truncated DNA."

https://openalex.org/W1522253950,"Glucosamine inhibits the incorporation of [2-3H]mannose into lipid-linked oligosaccharides and into glycoproteins in influenza virus-infected MDCK cells. Fifty per cent inhibition of these components requires about 2 mM glucosamine. The oligosaccharide portions of the lipid-linked oligosaccharides in cells inhibited with glucosamine were compared to that of normal cells by chromatography on Bio-Gel P-4 columns. In uninhibited cells, the major oligosaccharide formed from [2-3H]mannose was the Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 species as demonstrated by the products of endoglucosaminidase H and alpha-mannosidase digestion. At low concentrations of glucosamine (approximately 2 mM) or in short term incubations (1 to 2 h), the large oligosaccharide disappeared and was replaced by a Man7GlcNAc2 species. This was also characterized by various enzymatic treatments as well as its migration rate on Bio-Gel P-4 as compared to known oligosaccharides. At still higher glucosamine concentrations or longer incubation times, the Man7GlcNAc2 species also disappeared and was replaced by a Man3GlcNAc2 species. The effect of glucosamine was reversible such that when the cells were washed free of this inhibitor, they resumed the synthesis of the Glc3Man9GlcNAc2 species and the other two oligosaccharides disappeared. These smaller oligosaccharides were not observed when glucosamine was replaced by either 5 mM galactosamine or 5 mM N-acetylglucosamine."
https://openalex.org/W2122071597,"A basic protein has been isolated from sperm of the bivalve Spisula solidissima. Its characteristics are reminiscent of both histone H1 and of fish protamines. It is unusual in several respects: it contains similar amounts of lysine (24.8%) and arginine (23.1%), plus a residue of tryptophan per molecule. Its size is very large, approximately 297 amino acid residues. It shows a tendency to aggregate, an unusual property given the strongly charged nature of this protein."
https://openalex.org/W1583752109,"We have examined and characterized the regulation by glucocorticoids of the levels of arginase and argininosuccinate synthetase in two rat hepatoma cell lines (H4-II-E-C3 and MH1C1). Hydrocortisone elevates the activity of both enzymes in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. This effect was blunted markedly by small amounts of ethanol (0.1 to 0.9% [v/v]) and blocked substantially by a high molar excess of the anti-inducer steroid fluoxymesterone. The other optimal inducers dexamethasone and corticosterone were as effective as hydrocortisone in elevating the levels of these enzymes at saturating concentrations. Inhibition of these stimulations by cycloheximide indicated that ongoing cellular protein synthesis was required for both effects, and the admixture of extracts from fully stimulated and basal cells gave no evidence for the existence of direct inhibitors or activators of either enzyme. The results corroborate findings from earlier whole-animal studies and provide evidence for the following conclusions. (i) This stimulation by hydrocortisone of urea-cycle enzymes in the cultured hepatoma cells is mediated by a classical glucocorticoid mechanism involving initial binding to specific cytoplasmic steroid receptors and the eventual accumulation of new enzyme molecules. (ii) These cell lines thus constitute valid experimental models for use in further detailed studies on the molecular mechanism(s) through which glucocorticoids and intermediary metabolites effect a selective modulation of arginase and argininosuccinate-synthetase gene expression in the differentiated mammalian liver."
https://openalex.org/W1483069244,"Peptidophosphogalactomannan from Penicillium charlesii contains ethanolamine, presumably linked via phosphodiester to galactomannan (Rick, P. D., Drewes, L. R., and Gander, J. E., (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 2072-2078). These investigations have been extended using 13C and 31P NMR spectroscopy to show that peptidophosphogalactomannan also contains choline and that both ethanolamine and choline are linked through phosphodiester linkages to C-8 of mannosyl residues of the mannan region of peptidophosphogalactomannan. Approximately one-half of the bases derived from ethanolamine, and which are attached to the mannan as phosphodiesters, are released as choline upon treatment with dilute alkali. It was shown that 13C from L-[methyl-13C]methionine is incorporated into methyl groups of mannosyl-6-phosphocholine in vivo. There were no 13C NMR signals from the methyl carbons of either 2-methylaminoethanol (33.3 ppm) or 2-dimethylaminoethanol (45.9 ppm) observed in these experiments even though the major signal was from the methyl carbons of choline (56.9 ppm)."
https://openalex.org/W1543572651,"We have developed a photoactivable, heterobifunctional, reversible, radioactively labeled, chemical cross-linking reagent, 3-[(2-nitro-4-azidophenyl)-2-aminoethyldithio]-N-succinimidyl propionate, for studying the interactions of proteins in situ. When reacted in the dark with a purified protein, it forms a covalent derivative which can be purified and reconstituted into biological systems. This derivative will form cross-links to neighboring macromolecules only upon photolysis; reduction cleaves the cross-link and transfers the radiolabel to the second molecule, which can then be identified by standard techniques. We have tested the cross-linker using the binding of gelatin to fibronectin. The cross-linker gives the proper chemical behavior under biological conditions, reacts with high yield and with a very low level of nonspecific cross-linking, and can be used to identify protein-protein and other interactions at the cell surface and elsewhere. The advantages, limitations and possible uses for this reagent are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1592623162,"The chemical structure of the hormone binding region of the neurophysins has been investigated by photoaffinity labeling with the photolabile tripeptide, L-[methyl-3H]Met-L-Tyr-p-azido-L-Phe amide. Photolysis of the photoaffinity tripeptide in the presence of bovine neurophysin I and II and a human neurophysin II led to approximately equal extents of covalent incorporation of radioactivity into protein. Photolabeled bovine neurophysin II was fractionated into binding site derivatized protein and nonbinding site derivatized protein by affinity chromatography, with results of amino acid and radiolabel analysis of the hormone binding site blocked protein indicating that 1 mol of tripeptide was covalently incorporated/mol of protein. Tyrosine 49 was the only protein amino acid modified in the binding site photolabeling reaction as assessed by peptide mapping of the performic acid oxidized and trypsin-digested photolabeled protein using reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography. Modification of the single neurophysin tyrosine also was found by amino acid analysis of performic acid oxidized photolabeled bovine neurophysin II. The covalent bond formed in neurophysin upon photolysis was cleaved by either exhaustive acid hydrolysis or reduction-carboxymethylation without loss of the protein amino acid residues and by performic acid oxidation with loss of both protein and tripeptide tyrosine residues. These overall data indicate that tyrosine 49 is the probable site for specific covalent attachment of the photoaffinity tripeptide. Assuming that the tripeptide binding site is the high affinity hormone binding site reported for the neurophysins, this conclusion argues that tyrosine 49 is close to or within this site."
https://openalex.org/W2171210107,"A wide variety of modifications of rat liver phenylalanine hydroxylase, such as limited proteolysis and phosphorylation, leads to a selective increase in the tetrahydrobiopterin-dependent hydroxylase activity without affecting the 6-methyltetrahydropterin or the 6,7-dimethyltetrahydropterin-dependent activity. The ratio of hydroxylase activity in the presence of tetrahydrobiopterin and one of these synthetic pterins, therefore, can serve as an indicator of the state of activation of the enzyme. Comparisons of this ratio for the crude and the pure liver enzyme, indicated that the purified enzyme has undergone activation. We have studied this activation under controlled conditions and have found that it is a Mn2+-sensitive process that occurs in liver extracts that have been freed of small molecules. The activation appears to be different from any of those that have been described previously."

As isolated, the enzyme contains no detectable deoxyribonuclease activity. A catalytically active 12-kilodalton fragment of the DNA polymerase, apparently generated by endogenous proteolytic action, has also been purified. The native enzyme is found predominantly in the cytoplasmic fraction of broken leaf cell preparations and less than 10% is found associated with the nuclei."
https://openalex.org/W1608644241,"Two isoenzymes of ceramidase, including lysosomal acid ceramidase and nonlysosomal alkaline ceramidase, catalyze the degradation of ceramide in cultured human skin fibroblasts. A genetically determined disorder of sphingolipid metabolism (Farber's-disease) is characterized by the deficiency of acid ceramidase and by the pathological accumulation of ceramide. In this report, we take advantage of this genetic deficiency to study the intracellular transport of reconstituted low density lipoprotein (LDL) containing ceramide and of ceramide-containing liposomes into lysosomes. Our findings show that there is decreased incorporation of LDL in Farber's diseased fibroblasts, presumably related to the lack of lysosomal degradation of ceramide. In turnover experiments, the deficiency of lysosomal acid ceramidase in Farber's disease fibroblasts leads to the complete lack of degradation of ceramide internalized through the LDL uptake process. In contrast, this genetic defect does not affect either the uptake or turnover of ceramide-containing phosphatidylcholine liposomes. Comparison of these results suggests that in cultured skin fibroblasts the coated vesicles containing ceramide-LDL are designated for lysosomal delivery and are clearly distinguished from endocytotic vesicles involved in the uptake of ceramide-containing liposomes, which may be destined to be transported into subcellular organelles other than lysosomes."

The enzyme is pure by the criterion of disc gel electrophoresis with varying polyacrylamide concentrations. It is dimeric, and has an apparent molecular weight of 111,000. Each molecule contains 2 molecules of pyridoxal 5-phosphate. The apparent Km values for 4,5-dioxovalerate and L-alanine are 0.26 and 1.96 mM, respectively. In addition to alanine, glutamate also is an effective amino group donor. The enzyme is inhibited by various keto acids as well as by inhibitors of pyridoxal phosphate-containing enzymes. It was possible to show that 4,5-dioxovalerate is formed by cultures of C. tetanomorphum when grown in the presence of 0.2 M levulinate, an inhibitor of 5-aminolevulinate dehydratase."

This enzyme has a molecular weight of 56,000-62,000 and is composed of two subunits which are presumably identical. It is not a flavoprotein. Fluorometric titrations with NADPH revealed that the cofactor was bound to the free enzyme with a dissociation constant of 0.04 microM. The results of kinetic studies were compatible with either a random mechanism or an ordered mechanism with NADP binding first. Although this enzyme oxidizes prostacyclin more rapidly than any other prostaglandin, it reduces 4-nitrobenzaldehyde, phenanthrenequinone, and menadione more rapidly than it oxidizes prostacyclin."
https://openalex.org/W1570250946,"A protein capable of stimulating bone resorption in vitro has been purified approximately 1250-fold from cancer ascites fluid. Purification was accomplished employing successive fractionation with ammonium sulfate, ion exchange, and Cibacron blue affinity chromatography, isoelectric focusing, and selective adsorption on hydroxylapatite. The bone-resorptive protein obtained by this procedure appeared homogeneous in polyacrylamide gels at pH 9.5, migrating with the mobility of an alpha 2-globulin, and in sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels from which an apparent molecular weight of 43,000 was calculated. The amino acid composition of the bone-resorptive protein distinguished itself by the absence of methionine and by its relatively high content of glycine (17%) and proline (11%). Furthermore, the protein possesses a single NH2-terminal amino acid residue (glycine). The ascites protein was found to contain 19% carbohydrate by weight including a high content of sialic acid (15 residues/mol) as compared to the other sugars (27 residues/mol). As to its biological properties, the homogeneous ascites glycoprotein proved to be as potent as parathyroid hormone in its ability to stimulate bone resorption in vitro."
