https://openalex.org/W2023970230,"Soybean plants deprived of nickel accumulated toxic concentrations of urea (2.5 percent) in necrotic lesions on their leaflet tips. This occurred regardless of whether the plants were supplied with inorganic nitrogen or were dependent on nitrogen fixation. Nickel deprivation resulted in delayed nodulation and in a reduction of early growth. Addition of nickel (1 microgram per liter) to the nutrient media prevented urea accumulation, necrosis, and growth reductions. This evidence suggests that nickel is essential for soybeans and possibly for higher plants in general."
https://openalex.org/W2046368575,"As a result of the radioactive decay of rhenium-187 (4.6 x 10(10) years) the osmium-187/osmium-186 ratio changes in planetary systems as a function of time and the rhenium-187/osmium-186 ratio. For a value of the rhenium-187/osmium-186 ratio of about 3.2, typical of meteorites and the earth's mantle, the present-day osmium-187/osmium-186 ratio is about 1. The earth's continental crust has an estimated rhenium-187/osmium-186 ratio of about 400, so that for a mean age of the continent of 2 x 10(9) years, a present-day osmium-187/osmium-186 ratio of about 10 is expected. Marine manganese nodules show values (6 to 8.4) compatible with this expectation if allowance for a 25 percent mantle osmium supply to the oceans is allowed. The Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary iridium-rich layer in the marine section at Stevns Klint, Denmark, yields an osmium-187/osmium-186 ratio of 1.65, and the one in a continental section in the Raton Basin, Colorado, is 1.29. The simplest explanation is that these represent osmium imprints of predominantly meteoritic origin."
https://openalex.org/W2067753488,"A morphogenetically competent suspension culture was derived from embryonic axes of Glycine max cv. Mitchell. The cultural history included visual selection for nonfriable, embryo-like structures, recurrent selection in a regime of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid exposure and withdrawal, and the replacement of the nitrogen in a Murashige and Skoog salts-based medium with 20 millimolar ammonium citrate. The embryoids produced by this suspension are capable of completing plantlet development. The suspension can be maintained by serial subculture."
https://openalex.org/W2029292501,"Concentrations in Gulf of Mexico slope sediment of material soluble in methanol and benzene as high as 4.5 percent are shown to be attributable to biodegraded petroleum. Associated carbonate deposits and organic sulfur are the products of the microbial oxidation of petroleum and sulfate reduction. The results of chemical and carbon isotope analyses indicate that high concentrations of hydrocarbon gases, from methane to pentane, are petroleum rather than microbiologically derived. These hydrocarbons, believed to have been produced thermally at depth, probably reached the surface through faults and fractures associated with salt diapirs."
https://openalex.org/W1968185071,"Morphological features of the two-dimensional Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction were modeled with an algorithm involving only two simple parameters, one describing the productivity of the reaction on a local scale length and the other characterizing the delay or quiescent time after the localized reaction. Self-organizing wavelike structures, including single- and multiarmed spirals, were most easily generated."
https://openalex.org/W2069175317,Female Photuris fireflies guided by their prey's luminescence attack flying fireflies at night. They sometimes use this hunting tactic together with prey attraction by mating-signal mimicry. Such predation could have been a major factor in the evolution of signaling behavior of American fireflies. Nocturnal aerial predation by an insect and attack guidance on energy emitted by airborne prey have not previously been reported.
https://openalex.org/W2089306828,The torsional braid technique was used to monitor the changes in rigidity and damping characteristics of a polybenzimidazole as it changes from a thermoplastic polymer to a thermoset resin at about 450 degrees C. In an intermediate process the thermoplastic backbone of the polymer becomes flexible.
https://openalex.org/W2022654765,"The skeletons of phaeodarian Radiolaria transport and redistribute silica to the tropical deep oceans by dissolving in the water column and on the sea floor. The skeletons are initially solid but within a few days to months become progressively more porous while settling through the water column. Phaeodarian Radiolaria are rarely preserved in the bottom sediments; in contrast, polycystine Radiolaria are the dominant Radiolaria preserved in the fossil record. This preservational difference may be due to differences in skeletal constituents."

However, in only one animal was there significant transfer, between the hands, of a shape-discrimination habit learned postoperatively."

https://openalex.org/W2090704002,Thermal diffusivity and specific heat have been measured by the flash method on a small specimen of meteoritic iron from the Canyon Diablo fall. Measurements have been made over the temperature range -150 degrees to 300 degrees C from which thermal conductivity values have been calculated.

The outlook for additional organic superconducting compounds is discussed.
