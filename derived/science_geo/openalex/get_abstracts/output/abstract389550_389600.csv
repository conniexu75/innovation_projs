https://openalex.org/W1990174038,"Small molecules that perturb chromatin proteins are an emerging focus of current biomedical research. Two groups reporting in this issue have targeted bromodomain-containing BET proteins that bind acetylated lysine residues during gene activation, arriving at cell-permeable small molecule compounds with similar structures based on fused triazole-diazepine rings. James Bradner and colleagues report the development of a compound named JQ1. The BET protein BRD4, with two bromodomains, is implicated in human squamous cell carcinoma. JQ1 inhibits the growth of BRD4-dependent tumours in mouse models. Alexander Tarakhovsky and colleagues' inhibitor, I-BET, is shown to interfere with the binding of certain BET family members to acetylated histones. It inhibits activation of pro-inflammatory genes in macrophages and has immunomodulatory activity in a mouse model of inflammatory disease. Post-translationally modified histones are recognized by effector proteins which contain specific binding modules; for example, the bromodomain-containing BET proteins bind acetylated lysine residues during gene activation. Here a synthetic small molecule is described that interferes with the binding of certain BET family members to acetylated histones. The compound inhibits activation of pro-inflammatory genes in macrophages and has activity in a mouse model of inflammatory disease. Interaction of pathogens with cells of the immune system results in activation of inflammatory gene expression. This response, although vital for immune defence, is frequently deleterious to the host due to the exaggerated production of inflammatory proteins. The scope of inflammatory responses reflects the activation state of signalling proteins upstream of inflammatory genes as well as signal-induced assembly of nuclear chromatin complexes that support mRNA expression1,2,3,4. Recognition of post-translationally modified histones by nuclear proteins that initiate mRNA transcription and support mRNA elongation is a critical step in the regulation of gene expression5,6,7,8,9,10. Here we present a novel pharmacological approach that targets inflammatory gene expression by interfering with the recognition of acetylated histones by the bromodomain and extra terminal domain (BET) family of proteins. We describe a synthetic compound (I-BET) that by ‘mimicking’ acetylated histones disrupts chromatin complexes responsible for the expression of key inflammatory genes in activated macrophages, and confers protection against lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxic shock and bacteria-induced sepsis. Our findings suggest that synthetic compounds specifically targeting proteins that recognize post-translationally modified histones can serve as a new generation of immunomodulatory drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2129032286,"Mutations in the X-linked MECP2 gene, which encodes the transcriptional regulator methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2), cause Rett syndrome and several neurodevelopmental disorders including cognitive disorders, autism, juvenile-onset schizophrenia and encephalopathy with early lethality. Rett syndrome is characterized by apparently normal early development followed by regression, motor abnormalities, seizures and features of autism, especially stereotyped behaviours. The mechanisms mediating these features are poorly understood. Here we show that mice lacking Mecp2 from GABA (γ-aminobutyric acid)-releasing neurons recapitulate numerous Rett syndrome and autistic features, including repetitive behaviours. Loss of MeCP2 from a subset of forebrain GABAergic neurons also recapitulates many features of Rett syndrome. MeCP2-deficient GABAergic neurons show reduced inhibitory quantal size, consistent with a presynaptic reduction in glutamic acid decarboxylase 1 (Gad1) and glutamic acid decarboxylase 2 (Gad2) levels, and GABA immunoreactivity. These data demonstrate that MeCP2 is critical for normal function of GABA-releasing neurons and that subtle dysfunction of GABAergic neurons contributes to numerous neuropsychiatric phenotypes."
https://openalex.org/W2168126136,"Parkinson’s disease is a pervasive, ageing-related neurodegenerative disease the cardinal motor symptoms of which reflect the loss of a small group of neurons, the dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta1 (SNc). Mitochondrial oxidant stress is widely viewed as being responsible for this loss2, but why these particular neurons should be stressed is a mystery. Here we show, using transgenic mice that expressed a redox-sensitive variant of green fluorescent protein targeted to the mitochondrial matrix, that the engagement of plasma membrane L-type calcium channels during normal autonomous pacemaking created an oxidant stress that was specific to vulnerable SNc dopaminergic neurons. The oxidant stress engaged defences that induced transient, mild mitochondrial depolarization or uncoupling. The mild uncoupling was not affected by deletion of cyclophilin D, which is a component of the permeability transition pore, but was attenuated by genipin and purine nucleotides, which are antagonists of cloned uncoupling proteins. Knocking out DJ-1 (also known as PARK7 in humans and Park7 in mice), which is a gene associated with an early-onset form of Parkinson’s disease, downregulated the expression of two uncoupling proteins (UCP4 (SLC25A27) and UCP5 (SLC25A14)), compromised calcium-induced uncoupling and increased oxidation of matrix proteins specifically in SNc dopaminergic neurons. Because drugs approved for human use can antagonize calcium entry through L-type channels, these results point to a novel neuroprotective strategy for both idiopathic and familial forms of Parkinson’s disease."

https://openalex.org/W2051077990,"Photoreceptors for visual perception, phototaxis or light avoidance are typically clustered in eyes or related structures such as the Bolwig organ of Drosophila larvae. Unexpectedly, we found that the class IV dendritic arborization neurons of Drosophila melanogaster larvae respond to ultraviolet, violet and blue light, and are major mediators of light avoidance, particularly at high intensities. These class IV dendritic arborization neurons, which are present in every body segment, have dendrites tiling the larval body wall nearly completely without redundancy. Dendritic illumination activates class IV dendritic arborization neurons. These novel photoreceptors use phototransduction machinery distinct from other photoreceptors in Drosophila and enable larvae to sense light exposure over their entire bodies and move out of danger."

https://openalex.org/W2144207859,"Barth syndrome is an X-linked genetic disorder caused by mutations in the tafazzin (taz) gene and characterized by dilated cardiomyopathy, exercise intolerance, chronic fatigue, delayed growth, and neutropenia. Tafazzin is a mitochondrial transacylase required for cardiolipin remodeling. Although tafazzin function has been studied in non-mammalian model organisms, mammalian genetic loss of function approaches have not been used. We examined the consequences of tafazzin knockdown on sarcomeric mitochondria and cardiac function in mice. Tafazzin knockdown resulted in a dramatic decrease of tetralinoleoyl cardiolipin in cardiac and skeletal muscles and accumulation of monolysocardiolipins and cardiolipin molecular species with aberrant acyl groups. Electron microscopy revealed pathological changes in mitochondria, myofibrils, and mitochondrion-associated membranes in skeletal and cardiac muscles. Echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed severe cardiac abnormalities, including left ventricular dilation, left ventricular mass reduction, and depression of fractional shortening and ejection fraction in tafazzin-deficient mice. Tafazzin knockdown mice provide the first mammalian model system for Barth syndrome in which the pathophysiological relationships between altered content of mitochondrial phospholipids, ultrastructural abnormalities, myocardial and mitochondrial dysfunction, and clinical outcome can be completely investigated."
https://openalex.org/W2008639647,"Mutations in the metalloenzyme copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) cause one form of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and metals are suspected to play a pivotal role in ALS pathology. To learn more about metals in ALS, we determined the metallation states of human wild-type or mutant (G37R, G93A, and H46R/H48Q) SOD1 proteins from SOD1-ALS transgenic mice spinal cords. SOD1 was gently extracted from spinal cord and separated into insoluble (aggregated) and soluble (supernatant) fractions, and then metallation states were determined by HPLC inductively coupled plasma MS. Insoluble SOD1-rich fractions were not enriched in copper and zinc. However, the soluble mutant and WT SOD1s were highly metallated except for the metal-binding-region mutant H46R/H48Q, which did not bind any copper. Due to the stability conferred by high metallation of G37R and G93A, it is unlikely that these soluble SOD1s are prone to aggregation in vivo, supporting the hypothesis that immature nascent SOD1 is the substrate for aggregation. We also investigated the effect of SOD1 overexpression and disease on metal homeostasis in spinal cord cross-sections of SOD1-ALS mice using synchrotron-based x-ray fluorescence microscopy. In each mouse genotype, except for the H46R/H48Q mouse, we found a redistribution of copper between gray and white matters correlated to areas of high SOD1. Interestingly, a disease-specific increase of zinc was observed in the white matter for all mutant SOD1 mice. Together these data provide a picture of copper and zinc in the cell as well as highlight the importance of these metals in understanding SOD1-ALS pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2043573560,"The discovery of methods suitable for the conversion in vitro of native proteins into amyloid fibrils has shed light on the molecular basis of amyloidosis and has provided fundamental tools for drug discovery. We have studied the capacity of a small library of tetracycline analogues to modulate the formation or destructuration of β2-microglobulin fibrils. The inhibition of fibrillogenesis of the wild type protein was first established in the presence of 20% trifluoroethanol and confirmed under a more physiologic environment including heparin and collagen. The latter conditions were also used to study the highly amyloidogenic variant, P32G. The NMR analysis showed that doxycycline inhibits β2-microglobulin self-association and stabilizes the native-like species through fast exchange interactions involving specific regions of the protein. Cell viability assays demonstrated that the drug abolishes the natural cytotoxic activity of soluble β2-microglobulin, further strengthening a possible in vivo therapeutic exploitation of this drug. Doxycycline can disassemble preformed fibrils, but the IC50 is 5-fold higher than that necessary for the inhibition of fibrillogenesis. Fibril destructuration is a dynamic and time-dependent process characterized by the early formation of cytotoxic protein aggregates that, in a few hours, convert into non-toxic insoluble material. The efficacy of doxycycline as a drug against dialysis-related amyloidosis would benefit from the ability of the drug to accumulate just in the skeletal system where amyloid is formed. In these tissues, the doxycycline concentration reaches values several folds higher than those resulting in inhibition of amyloidogenesis and amyloid destructuration in vitro.

Although all peripheral organs (but not the brain) can be potentially affected (3Giorgetti S. Raimondi S. Cassinelli S. Bucciantini M. Stefani M. Gregorini G. Albonico G. Moratti R. Montagna G. Stoppini M. Bellotti V. Nephrol. Dial. Transplant. 2009; 24: 1176-1181Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), the muscle-skeletal tissues are the preferential target always involved in this type of amyloidosis. Despite significant progress achieved in the hemodialysis techniques, including the increased biocompatibility and the active removal of circulating β2-m, the onset of this amyloidosis can be delayed but not avoided in dialysis-related amyloidosis patients (4Yamamoto S. Kazama J.J. Maruyama H. Nishi S. Narita I. Gejyo F. Clin. Nephrol. 2008; 70: 496-502Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). New therapeutic approaches, targeting the process of protein aggregation and promoting fibril solubilization (5Bellotti V. Nuvolone M. Giorgetti S. Obici L. Palladini G. Russo P. Lavatelli F. Perfetti V. Merlini G. Ann. Med. 2007; 39: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), are under investigation for the treatment of different types of amyloid diseases. Up until now, different classes of structurally unrelated compounds have been investigated for their ability to interfere with protein self-aggregation and to weaken the intermolecular interactions that stabilize the fibrillar structure of the aggregates (6De Lorenzi E. Giorgetti S. Grossi S. Merlini G. Caccialanza G. Bellotti V. Curr. Med. Chem. 2004; 11: 1065-1084Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Over 10 years ago, iododoxorubicin was serendipitously discovered as the prototype of a class of compounds able to inhibit protein aggregation (7Merlini G. Ascari E. Amboldi N. Bellotti V. Arbustini E. Perfetti V. Ferrari M. Zorzoli I. Marinone M.G. Garini P. Diegoli M. Trizio D. Ballinari D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1995; 92: 2959-2963Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), but this compound was subsequently abandoned for its toxicity. The resemblance of the polycyclic conjugated structure of tetracyclines with iododoxorubicin prompted a group studying the pathologic aggregation of the prion protein to test the properties of those antibiotics in the propagation of prion-related diseases (8Tagliavini F.

Biol. 2000; 300: 1309-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The successful results thereof stimulated further challenges. So far it has been shown that tetracyclines are able to antagonize the infectivity of the PrPsc aggregates (9De Luigi A. Colombo L. Diomede L. Capobianco R. Mangieri M. Miccolo C. Limido L.

The generic anti-aggregation property of tetracyclines has been confirmed in the fibrillogenesis of myoglobin (15Malmo C. Vilasi S. Iannuzzi C. Tacchi S. Cametti C. Irace G. Sirangelo I.

In this study, we sought to evaluate the effect of tetracyclines in modulating, in vitro, the formation and the stability of β2-m fibrils. It is worth noting that tetracyclines selectively accumulate in the skeletal system (17Agwuh K.N. MacGowan A. J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 2006; 58: 256-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (550) Google Scholar), where they maintain biological properties such as metalloprotease inhibition (18Saikali Z. Singh G. Anticancer Drugs. 2003; 14: 773-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Therefore, the local concentration of bioactive tetracyclines, at the site of amyloid formation, should largely exceed that needed to interfere with stability and growth of the β2-m amyloid deposits that accumulate preferentially onto bone joints and cartilage. We show here that doxycycline and a group of analogues inhibit amyloid aggregation and induce amyloid fibril disassembly with the initial appearance of toxic oligomers that subsequently reorganize into harmless assemblies. The 13 tetracycline congeners, reported in supplemental Fig. 1 in the hydrochloride form, were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. Their purity was always above 95%. Drugs were dissolved in deionized water at 3 mm (stock solutions) and kept at −20 °C for no more than 2 months. Under these conditions, they were stable as determined by reverse phase HPLC. Aliquots of drugs were added to 50 or 70 mm phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 or 6.7, containing 100 mm NaCl, in the presence or absence of 20% (v/v) trifluoroethanol (TFE) or in pure water and immediately used to minimize their oxidation. Expression and purification of recombinant β2-m species were carried out as reported previously (19Esposito G. Michelutti R. Verdone G. Viglino P. Hernández H. Robinson C.V. Amoresano A. Dal Piaz F. Monti M. Pucci P. Mangione P. Stoppini M. Merlini G. Ferri G. Bellotti V. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 831-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In addition to wild type protein that makes fibrils under non-physiologic conditions, we have also investigated the P32G variant that can make fibrils in more physiological conditions (20Jahn T.R. Parker M.J. Homans S.W. Radford S.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar), at neutral pH, and in the absence of any organic solvent. Recombinant wild type β2-m (100 μm) was incubated at 37 °C in 50 mm phosphate buffer, 100 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 20% (v/v) TFE and preformed β2-m fibrils seeds at 2.5 μg/ml (21Yamamoto S. Yamaguchi I. Hasegawa K. Tsutsumi S. Goto Y. Gejyo F. Naiki H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Recombinant β2-m presenting the P32G mutation, at a concentration of 40 μm, was incubated at 37 °C under agitation at 250 rpm in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, in the presence of 100 μg/ml heparin and preformed β2-m fibrils seeds at a concentration of 2.5 μg/ml. Quantification of amyloid fibril formation was performed using thioflavin T (ThT) as described previously (22Esposito G. Ricagno S. Corazza A. Rennella E. Gümral D. Mimmi M.C. Betto E. Pucillo C.E. Fogolari F. Viglino P. Raimondi S. Giorgetti S. Bolognesi B. Merlini G. Stoppini M. Bolognesi M. Bellotti V. J. Mol. Biol. 2008; 378: 887-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). β2-m fibrillogenesis was carried out in the presence of different concentrations of tetracyclines (50, 100, 200, 300 μm) to evaluate their effect on the growth of fibrils. Dose-response fluorescence data were fitted by non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism 5.03 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA), and IC50 was determined from the best fitting of three experiments using a standard Hill slope dose-response curvey=a+b−a1+10(x−logIC50)(Eq. 1) where a and b are the bottom and top plateau, respectively. 30 μl of the fibrillogenesis mixture with 300 μm different tetracycline analogues were centrifuged after 96 h of incubation at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant and protein pellets were analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). Pellets were resuspended in 3 μl of PBS buffer to be analyzed. Quantification of bands within each lane was carried out using the Quantity One software (Bio-Rad), and the percentages of β2-m in both supernatant and pellet were determined as compared with control β2-m. Destructuration of β2-m fibrils by doxycycline was evaluated by ThT assay and by electron microscopy by incubating ex vivo and synthetic β2-m fibrils in the presence of 300 μm doxycycline for 12 days. The interaction between β2-m and doxycycline was analyzed by NMR spectroscopy under three different solvent conditions: (a) 70 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 100 mm NaCl, pH 6.7; (b) 70 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 100 mm NaCl, 18% (v/v) TFE, pH 6.7; (c) pure water, pH 5.5–6.6. A few microliters of 100 mm stock solution of doxycycline in pure water were incrementally added to the 0.125–0.7 mm β2-m samples to reach protein:doxycycline molar ratios of 1:0.3, 1:0.6, 1:1, 1:1.5, 1:2, 1:2.6, 1:3, and 1:6. All the NMR samples contained 5% D2O for frequency lock purpose. NMR experiments were recorded on a Bruker AVANCE spectrometer operating at 500 MHz (1H) and equipped with x-y-z-gradient accessory. Besides one-dimensional spectra, conventional proton homonuclear two-dimensional total correlation spectroscopy (24Braunschweiler L. Ernst R.R. J. Magn. Reson. 1983; 53: 521-528Crossref Scopus (3112) Google Scholar) and NOESY (25Jeener J. Meier B.H. Bachmann P. Ernst R.R. J. Chem. Phys. 1979; 71: 286-292Crossref Scopus (4845) Google Scholar) were recorded to assign doxycycline. Two-dimensional [1H-15N] HSQC (26Bodenhausen G. Ruben D.J. Chem. Phys. Lett. 1980; 69: 185-189Crossref Scopus (2435) Google Scholar) experiments were acquired with 128–256 increments collected in t1 with 2,048 data points and 16–32 scans/FID in t2, over a spectral width of 14 and 33.5 ppm in proton and nitrogen dimension, respectively. Data were processed with Topspin (Bruker Biospin) and analyzed with Sparky. The chemical shift variations of the [1H-15N] HSQC spectra were calculated according Mulder et al. (27Mulder F.A. Schipper D. Bott R. Boelens R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 111-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) using the formulaΔδ=(δHN)2+(ΔδNH6)2(Eq. 2) with the hydrogen (first term) and nitrogen (second term) Δδ values expressed in ppm. The chemical shift values of β2-m are deposited at the Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank (BMRB) (accession number 15521). Diffusion coefficients were measured by using the convection-compensated two-dimensional double stimulated echo-bipolar pulse (DSTE-BPP) sequence (28Jerschow A. Müller N. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 132: 13-18Crossref Scopus (86) Google Scholar) to collect matrices of 2,048 (t2) by 80 points (t1). The z axis gradient strength was varied linearly from 2 to 95% of its maximum value (61.1 G/cm). Water suppression was achieved with the addition, in the specific sequence, of a sculpting module (29Hwang T.L. Shaka A.J. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. A. 1995; 112: 275-279Crossref Scopus (1579) Google Scholar) or using a flip-back pulse in the HSQC experiments (30Grzesiek S. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1993; 115: 12593-12594Crossref Scopus (1015) Google Scholar). Human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and cultured in 1:1 Ham's F-10:DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 3.0 mm glutamine, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin, in a 5.0% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 °C. Cell viability was assessed by the MTT reduction inhibition assay. The cells were plated on 96-well plates at a density of 6,000 cells/well in 200 μl of fresh medium. After 72 h, the cells were exposed for 24 h to β2-m previously resolubilized in PBS in the absence or in the presence of different concentrations of drug at 37 °C for 1 h or with vehicle for control. The cells were also exposed to preformed fibrils previously treated at 37 °C with different concentrations of doxycycline for different lengths of time. At the end of the incubation, the cell culture medium was removed, and the cells were incubated for 2.0 h with 100 μl of a 0.5 mg/ml MTT solution in DMEM without phenol red. After incubation, cell lysis solution (100 μl/well: 20% SDS, 50% N,N-dimethylformamide) was added to the samples that were incubated overnight at 37 °C in a humidified incubator. Blue formazan absorbance was measured at 570 nm using an automatic plate reader (Bio-Rad). Aggregation of β2-m in the presence of fibrillar collagen and heparin was performed as reported previously (31Relini A. Canale C. De Stefano S. Rolandi R. Giorgetti S. Stoppini M. Rossi A. Fogolari F. Corazza A. Esposito G. Gliozzi A. Bellotti V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16521-16529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), in the absence and in the presence of 360 μm doxycycline. For atomic force microscopy (AFM) inspection, a collagen aliquot was extracted from the protein solution, deposited onto freshly cleaved mica, gently washed with buffer, and dried under a nitrogen stream. β2-m fibrils formed in the presence of TFE as detailed above were employed to test the effects of exposure to doxycycline on fibril structure. A 10-μl aliquot of β2-m fibrils treated with doxycycline was incubated on freshly cleaved mica for 5 min, rinsed with Milli-Q water to remove the materials not adhering to the substrate, and then dried under mild vacuum. Tapping mode AFM images were acquired in air using a Dimension 3100 scanning probe microscope equipped with a “G” scanning head (maximum scan size 100 μm) and driven by a Nanoscope IIIa controller and a MultiMode scanning probe microscope equipped with an “E” scanning head (maximum scan size 10 μm) and driven by a Nanoscope IV controller (Digital Instruments-Veeco, Santa Barbara, CA). Single beam uncoated silicon cantilevers (type OMCL-AC160TS, Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) were used. The drive frequency was between 320 and 340 kHz, and the scan rate was between 0.5 and 1.5 Hz. Aggregate sizes were measured from the height in cross-section of the topographic AFM images; due to the drying procedure applied, the measured sizes are reduced with respect to fully hydrated conditions. We initially tested the concentration-dependent ability of 13 tetracycline analogues (supplemental Fig. 1) to inhibit fibrillogenesis of wild type β2-m in vitro. According to the ThT assay proposed by Yamamoto et al. (21Yamamoto S. Yamaguchi I. Hasegawa K. Tsutsumi S. Goto Y. Gejyo F. Naiki H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), we found that only seven analogues were able to inhibit β2-m fibril growth at a drug concentration limit <300 μm. For these seven compounds, we determined the IC50 activity value that corresponds to the molar concentration of the drug at which the specific fluorescence of the ThT-amyloid fibril complex is reduced by 50% (Fig. 1). The IC50 values for these seven compounds ranged from 47 ± 5 μm for doxycycline and 49 ± 9 μm for 4-epi-oxytetracycline (the most effective compounds) to 136 ± 9 μm for anhydrochlortetracycline and rolitetracycline. The inhibition of fibrillogenesis by tetracyclines is consistent with the inhibition of protein self-aggregation. The inhibition of aggregation was confirmed by quantifying the soluble fraction of β2-m after centrifugation. Electrophoresis of the supernatant and the precipitate (Fig. 2) showed that both doxycycline and 4-epi-oxytetracycline exhibit the highest effect of solubilization of β2-m fibrils. Other analogues, such as minocycline or 4-epianhydrotetracycline, left most of the protein in the precipitate. The ability of doxycycline to inhibit β2-m fibrillogenesis was confirmed using the P32G variant that can elongate fibril seeds in phosphate buffer at pH 7.0 (20Jahn T.R. Parker M.J. Homans S.W. Radford S.E. Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2006; 13: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 reports the dose-response effect of doxycycline on fibril formation by this variant from which we derived an IC50 of 95 ± 22 μm.FIGURE 2a, SDS-PAGE of the supernatant and protein pellet obtained after centrifugation of the fibrillogenesis mixtures containing 100 μm β2-m and 300 μm of each tetracycline congener.

For β2-m, we have recently set up a method of in vitro fibrillogenesis that generates β2-m fibrils under conditions reproducing a physiological milieu in the presence of two ubiquitous constituents of amyloid fibrils: collagen and heparin (31Relini A. Canale C. De Stefano S. Rolandi R. Giorgetti S. Stoppini M. Rossi A. Fogolari F. Corazza A. Esposito G. Gliozzi A. Bellotti V. J. Biol.

Although the method exhibits some variability in the time of onset of fibril growth, probably because of the complexity of the aggregation conditions, AFM analysis is extremely sensitive and specific for monitoring fibril growth on the surface of collagen fibers. Therefore, we used these conditions to investigate the effect of doxycycline on β2-m fibrillization onto collagen. We compared the AFM pattern of a β2-m sample aggregated in the absence of doxycycline (Fig. 4a) or in the presence of 360 μm doxycycline (Fig. 4b) after 3 months of incubation. In the absence of doxycycline, large bundles of fibrils (black arrows), intertwined or running parallel to each other, were present in close proximity to collagen fibers (white arrows). The latter exhibit a much larger size and appear completely covered by a homogeneous layer of aggregated proteins that masks, at least partially, their typical banding pattern. At variance, in the presence of doxycycline, a completely different pattern was observed (Fig. 4b). Strikingly, in this case, β2-m fibrils are totally missing, whereas both collagen fibers and background appear covered by tightly packed globular material (Fig. 4b, inset) that masks, even more effectively, the banding pattern of collagen fibers. Having assessed the inhibitory effect of doxycycline, we tested whether fibril growth was inhibited even at lower (50–200 μm) doxycycline concentrations. After 2 months of aggregation, fibrils were repeatedly observed in the sample incubated with 50 μm doxycycline, whereas at 100 and 200 μm doxycycline, the fibrils were absent (results not shown). The tetracyclines previously found to display the best anti-fibrillogenic activity with soluble β2-m were tested for their ability to solubilize preformed β2-m fibrils. The specific results obtained with doxycycline are reported in Fig. 5a. Fibrils at a concentration of 100 μm (based on monomeric β2-m) were exposed to increasing concentrations of doxycycline, and the ThT fluorescence was measured after 12 h of incubation. The IC50 required for fibril decomposition was much higher (5-fold) than that necessary to inhibit fibril growth. The material incubated with doxycycline at the concentration inducing 100% inhibition of ThT fluorescence was further analyzed by electron microscopy that confirmed the complete loss of the fibrillar structure (Fig. 5, b and c). Despite the destructuration of the ordered fibrillar assembly, the material coming from doxycycline-treated fibrils was still insoluble in physiologic buffer, suggesting that the fibrillar protein does not recover a native or native-like soluble structure upon incubation with doxycycline. To provide information on the drug effects at the atomic level, the interaction between β2-m (0.12–0.7 mm) and doxycycline was analyzed by NMR spectroscopy under different solvent conditions, namely aqueous 70 mm phosphate buffer, 100 mm NaCl (pH 6.7), the same saline buffer containing 18% TFE (v/v), and pure water. These environments, although non-physiological, were selected to monitor the effect of doxycycline under conditions supporting (saline buffer, and much less effectively, pure water) or challenging (TFE) the conformational stability of the protein in solution. As in most biophysical investigations, however, physiologically distant conditions enable highlighting trends and drawing conclusions that help in interpreting functional biology. In particular, the saline buffer containing 18% TFE, although preventing excessive protein precipitation, is a fibrillogenic condition in the presence of nucleating fibril seeds (33Yamaguchi K. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2006; 363: 279-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) that is expected to approach very closely the partial unfolding and spreading over conformational ensembles also including fibril-competent species. Despite being far from the physiological fibrillogenic conditions, a TFE content around 20% in aqueous suspensions of fibril nuclei (seeds) has been repeatedly shown to result in the growth of fibrils that exhibit the same properties as the natural ones (21Yamamoto S. Yamaguchi I. Hasegawa K. Tsutsumi S. Goto Y. Gejyo F. Naiki H. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2004; 15: 126-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar), making such a condition an established method of in vitro fibrillogenesis of wild type β2-m (34Yamaguchi K. Takahashi S. Kawai T. Naiki H. Goto Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 352: 952-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). At the doxycycline concentrations that were used for NMR experiments (0.12–3.0 mm), as imposed by the required protein concentrations and ratios, the best solubility was observed in pure water. In aqueous phosphate and NaCl, with or without TFE, doxycycline addition to protein solution was always accompanied by visible clouding and partial precipitation. When doxycycline was added to the β2-m solution in the absence of the organic co-solvent but in the presence of phosphate buffer and NaCl, we found very minor changes in the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum of the protein recorded at 37 °C. The chemical shifts of the protein amide correlation, along with the other 1H resonances, remained constant up to a nominal protein:doxycycline stoichiometry of ∼1:6. Minor chemical shift changes could be detected only for the 15N-1H correlation of the Phe-22 residue, whereas a number of other backbone amide cross-peaks exhibited distinct and progressive amplitude changes (supplemental Fig. 2). The corresponding residues map to the A-B loop, the B and C strands together with the intervening loop, the C′ strand and the following C′-D loop, the D-E loop, the F strand, and the C-terminal segment.

Nuclear γ-H2AX foci represent the first detectable response of cells to DNA tumorigenesis lesions, such as the double-strand breaks (DSBs). An excess of micronucleated peripheral lymphocytes was found in subjects with cancer or inflammation-based diseases. We set out to investigate the expression of genome damage, from DNA lesions to chromosome mutations (micronuclei), in overweight and obese children. Using the γ-H2AX focus assay and micronucleus (MN) test, we analyzed peripheral lymphocytes from 119 Italian children classified as normal weight (n=38), overweight (n=20), or obese (n=61). Cultures treated with bleomycin (BLM) were also set up for each child in both assays to check functioning of the apparatus that ensures DNA integrity. We measured serum TNF-α, IL-6, and C-reactive protein (CRP) as markers of inflammation. Overweight and obese children had significantly higher levels of H2AX phosphorylation (0.0191±0.0039 and 0.0274±0.0029 γ-H2AXF/n) and increased MN frequencies (2.30±0.25 and 2.45±0.22‰) than normal-weight children (0.0034±0.0006 γ-H2AXF/n, and 0.92±0.12‰ MN), while all subjects responded to BLM induction, irrespective of their weight status. The fold increase of spontaneous MN frequencies in overweight and obese subjects was 2.5 and 2.7, respectively, well below the corresponding increase in the γ-H2AX foci (5.6- and 8.0-fold, respectively). IL-6 and CRP mean values were significantly higher in obese and overweight children than in controls. Here, we demonstrated that peripheral cells of overweight and obese children showed increased levels of DSBs, which were not completely repaired as part of them has been converted into micronuclei. Characterization of childhood obesity inflammation could be implemented using molecular markers of genome damage."

Mss51, a specific COX1 mRNA translational activator and Cox1 chaperone, drives the regulatory mechanism. During translation and post-translationally, newly synthesized Cox1 physically interacts with a complex of proteins involving Ssc1, Mss51, and Cox14, which eventually hand over Cox1 to the assembly pathway. This step is probably catalyzed by assembly chaperones such as Shy1 in a process coupled to the release of Ssc1-Mss51 from the complex. Impaired COX assembly results in the trapping of Mss51 in the complex, thus limiting its availability for COX1 mRNA translation. An exception is a null mutation in COX14 that does not affect Cox1 synthesis because the Mss51 trapping complexes become unstable, and Mss51 is readily available for translation. Here we present evidence showing that Cox25 is a new essential COX assembly factor that plays some roles similar to Cox14. A null mutation in COX25 by itself or in combination with other COX mutations does not affect Cox1 synthesis.

https://openalex.org/W1982297909,"Testicular receptors 2 and 4 (TR2/4) constitute a subgroup of orphan nuclear receptors that play important roles in spermatogenesis, lipid and lipoprotein regulation, and the development of the central nervous system. Currently, little is known about the structural features and the ligand regulation of these receptors. Here we report the crystal structure of the ligand-free TR4 ligand binding domain, which reveals an autorepressed conformation. The ligand binding pocket of TR4 is filled by the C-terminal half of helix 10, and the cofactor binding site is occupied by the AF-2 helix, thus preventing ligand-independent activation of the receptor. However, TR4 exhibits constitutive transcriptional activity on multiple promoters, which can be further potentiated by nuclear receptor coactivators. Mutations designed to disrupt cofactor binding, dimerization, or ligand binding substantially reduce the transcriptional activity of this receptor. Importantly, both retinol and retinoic acid are able to promote TR4 to recruit coactivators and to activate a TR4-regulated reporter. These findings demonstrate that TR4 is a ligand-regulated nuclear receptor and suggest that retinoids might have a much wider regulatory role via activation of orphan receptors such as TR4."
https://openalex.org/W2059584863,"Bacterial cultures, especially biofilms, produce a small number of persister cells, a genetically identical subpopulation of wild type cells that are metabolically dormant, exhibit multidrug tolerance, and are highly enriched in bacterial toxins. The gene most highly up-regulated in Escherichia coli persisters is mqsR, a ribonuclease toxin that, along with mqsA, forms a novel toxin·antitoxin (TA) system. Like all known TA systems, both the MqsR·MqsA complex and MqsA alone regulate their own transcription. Despite the importance of TA systems in persistence and biofilms, very little is known about how TA modules, and antitoxins in particular, bind and recognize DNA at a molecular level. Here, we report the crystal structure of MqsA bound to a 26-bp fragment from the mqsRA promoter. We show that MqsA binds DNA predominantly via its C-terminal helix-turn-helix domain, with direct binding of recognition helix residues Asn97 and Arg101 to the DNA major groove. Unexpectedly, the structure also revealed that the MqsA N-terminal domain interacts with the DNA phosphate backbone. This results in a more than 105° rotation of the N-terminal domains between the free and complexed states, an unprecedented rearrangement for an antitoxin. The structure also shows that MqsA bends the DNA by more than 55° in order to achieve symmetrical binding.

Biofilms, complex communities of bacteria that are encased in an extracellular matrix and adhere to almost any surface, are responsible for more than 65–80% of human infections (1Lopez D. Vlamakis H. Kolter R. Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2010; 2: a000398Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar, 2Cos P. Tote K. Horemans T. Maes L. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2010; 16: 2279-2295Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Moreover, these infections are extremely difficult to treat because biofilms are both highly resistant to host defenses and tolerant to antimicrobials (3Anderson G.G. O'Toole G.A. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 2008; 322: 85-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Currently, a detailed understanding of how biofilms assemble, how they are regulated at a molecular level, and how they achieve antibiotic resistance is only rudimentarily understood. One significant mechanism by which biofilms achieve antibiotic tolerance is through the formation of bacterial persister cells (4Keren I. Shah D. Spoering A. Kaldalu N. Lewis K. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8172-8180Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 5del Pozo J.L. Patel R. Clin. Pharmacol. Ther. 2007; 82: 204-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 6Stewart P.S.

Lancet. 1944; 244: 497-500Abstract Scopus (767) Google Scholar). They are also exceptionally tolerant to antibiotics and able to survive (or “persist”) exposure to antibiotic concentrations that are toxic for regular cells (4Keren I. Shah D. Spoering A. Kaldalu N. Lewis K. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 8172-8180Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 7Bigger J.W. Lancet. 1944; 244: 497-500Abstract Scopus (767) Google Scholar, 8Korch S.B. Henderson T.A.

Kelly A.J. Mardis M.J. Moyed H.S. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5732-5739Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), the frequency is as high as 1 in 100 in biofilms (10Spoering A.L. Lewis K. J.

The increased incidence of persister cells in biofilms and their role in human bacterial infections have stimulated renewed efforts to understand the molecular mechanism(s) that underlies the persister phenotype. Recent studies have demonstrated that the frequency at which persisters occur in populations of Escherichia coli is determined by the expression of chromosomal toxin·antitoxin (TA) 2The abbreviations used are: TAtoxin·antitoxinHTHhelix-turn-helixMqsA-Ffull-length MqsAMqsA-NN-terminal toxin-binding domain of MqsAMqsA-CC-terminal XRE-HTH domain of MqsA. genes (4Keren I.

TA pairs are composed of two genes organized in an operon that encode an unstable, labile antitoxin and a stable toxin, which associate to form a stable complex (13Gerdes K. Christensen S.K.

There are currently nine established toxin families (18Van Melderen L. Saavedra De Bast M. PLoS Genet. 2009; 5: e1000437Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar), and similarities between toxins in fold and function are slowly emerging (19Brown B.L. Grigoriu S. Kim Y. Arruda J.M.

Biochemistry. 2010; 49: 2205-2215Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). However, there is much greater diversity in structure and toxin recognition among antitoxins. TA systems are regulated by distinct differences in their lifetimes (21Van Melderen L. Bernard P. Couturier M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 11: 1151-1157Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Thus, the most important hallmark of antitoxins is their ability to be rapidly degraded by proteolysis. Under silent conditions, the activity of the toxin is blocked by the antitoxin. However, under conditions of stress, the antitoxins are degraded by proteases (21Van Melderen L. Bernard P. Couturier M. Mol.

This degradation outpaces the formation of the TA complex and leads to rapid growth arrest by the cellular effects of the toxin (25Jiang Y. Pogliano J. Helinski D.R. Konieczny I. Mol.

Science. 2009; 323: 396-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). TA complexes also regulate their own transcription, where the antitoxins bind to the promoter DNAs within their own operons and the cognate toxins enhance DNA binding (28de Feyter R. Wallace C.

The antitoxin MqsA is even more unusual because it is the first antitoxin that requires a metal, zinc, for structural stability (19Brown B.L. Grigoriu S. Kim Y. Arruda J.M. Davenport A. Wood T.K.

Grigoriu S. Kim Y. Arruda J.M. Davenport A. Wood T.K. Peti W. Page R. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000706Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar) as well as cspD (31Kim Y. Wang X. Zhang X.S. Grigoriu S. Page R. Peti W. Wood T.K. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 12: 1105-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Moreover, although 14 antitoxin structures have been solved to date, their primary sequences are highly divergent when compared with MqsA (supplemental Table S1) because the sequence identity between MqsA and the most closely related antitoxin, the E. coli protein HigA, is only 13%. We recently showed that MqsA is a dimer, with the MqsR·MqsA complex forming a heterotetramer of composition MqsR·MqsA2·MqsR. MqsA is composed of an N-terminal zinc-binding domain, MqsA-N, which binds MqsR, and a C-terminal helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain, MqsA-C, which binds DNA and mediates dimerization (19Brown B.L. Grigoriu S. Kim Y. Arruda J.M. Davenport A. Wood T.K. Peti W. Page R. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000706Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) showed that DNA binding is mediated exclusively by MqsA-C because MqsA-N both alone and in complex with MqsR is not capable of binding the mqsRA promoter (PmqsRA) (19Brown B.L. Grigoriu S. Kim Y. Arruda J.M. Davenport A. Wood T.K. Peti W. Page R. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000706Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, the atomic resolution structure of MqsA suggested that the MqsA-N domains may also play a role in DNA binding. In addition, EMSA studies showed that the MqsR·MqsA complex binds PmqsRA DNA with a higher affinity than MqsA alone (35Yamaguchi Y. Park J.H. Inouye M. J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 28746-28753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), suggesting that MqsR may also interact with DNA. Finally, the palindromic sequence of PmqsRA is separated by a TA tract, which typically leads to changes in DNA curvature (41Haran T.E. Mohanty U. Q. Rev. Biophys. 2009; 42: 41-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This suggests that MqsA recognition of PmqsRA DNA may be achieved using a combination of both direct readout (direct discriminatory contacts are made between the protein and the bases in the major groove) and indirect readout (no direct contacts are made between the protein and the bases, and, instead, specificity is achieved by water-mediated hydrogen bonding and/or the induction of DNA distortion) (42Lawson C.L. Breman H.M. Rice P.A. Correll C.C. Indirect Readout of DNA Sequence by Proteins. The Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge2008: 66-90Google Scholar, 43Little E.J. Babic A.C. Horton N.C. Structure. 2008; 16: 1828-1837Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In order to understand the structural basis of DNA binding, regulation, and specificity by the MqsA antitoxin, the x-ray crystallographic structure of MqsA bound to a 26-base pair DNA fragment derived from the mqsRA promoter was determined. These studies reveal that MqsA undergoes extensive domain rearrangements upon DNA binding and explains why both full-length MqsA and the MqsR·MqsA complex bind DNA with higher affinities than MqsA-C alone. A combination of EMSA competition assays and NMR spectroscopy titration studies was then used to show that MqsA recognizes PmqsRA DNA using direct readout, which is mediated by MqsA residues Asn97 and Arg101. Finally, our studies reveal that the MqsR·MqsA complex probably uses a mechanism of co-transcriptional regulation in which both MqsA and MqsR bind directly to DNA and provides further evidence that MqsA utilizes steric occlusion to mitigate MqsR-mediated toxicity. Full-length MqsA (residues 1–131; MqsA-F), MqsA N-terminal domain (residues 1–76; MqsA-N), and MqsA C-terminal domain (residues 62–131; MqsA-C) were cloned and expressed as described previously (19Brown B.L. Grigoriu S. Kim Y. Arruda J.M. Davenport A. Wood T.K. Peti W. Page R. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000706Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Multiple DNA duplexes that correspond to the palindromic region of PmqsRA were prepared and screened for crystallization with MqsA as described previously (44Brown B.L. Page R. Acta Crystallogr. F. 2010; 66: 1060-1063Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Briefly, the MqsA PmqsRA dsDNA complex that formed crystals suitable for structure determination (hereafter referred to as MqsA·PmqsRA) was prepared by incubating 24 μm MqsA with 30 μm PmqsRA dsDNA (TGTAATTAACCTTTTAGGTTATAACT; palindrome is underlined) in protein stabilization buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride). After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, the complex was concentrated 10-fold using a 3000 Da molecular mass cut-off centrifugal filter (Millipore) and immediately subjected to crystallization trials. A single merohedrally twinned crystal of the MqsA·PmqsRA complex formed in 0.2 m ammonium chloride, 20% PEG 3350 at 4 °C in a drop containing 0.2 μl of protein and 0.4 μl of crystallization condition. The MqsA·PmqsRA crystal was cryoprotected by a short soak in mother liquor supplemented with 20% glycerol and then frozen by direct transfer to liquid nitrogen. This crystal diffracted to 2.1 Å. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the NSLS X25 microfocus beamline at a wavelength of 0.9788 Å using an ADSC Q315 CCD detector. Data were indexed, integrated, and scaled with DENZO and SCALEPACK from the HKL-2000 program package (45Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Macromol. Crystallogr. A. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). As reported previously (44Brown B.L. Page R. Acta Crystallogr. F. 2010; 66: 1060-1063Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), analysis with phenix.xtriage (46Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N. Headd J.J. Hung L.W. Kapral G.J.

Phase determination and structure solution were performed with two successive rounds of molecular replacement using Phaser (47McCoy A.J. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Adams P.D. Winn M.D. Storoni L.C. Read R.J. J. Appl Crystallogr. 2007; 40: 658-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (14771) Google Scholar). First, a search was performed with two copies of the MqsA N-terminal domain (PDB entry 3GA8) and two copies of the MqsA C-terminal domain (PDB entry 3FMY). This produced a single solution in P41. A second round of molecular replacement was then used to search for an additional four copies of a 5-mer DNA duplex. A single solution was obtained with a final log likelihood gain of 975. The Rfree set (9.42%) was assigned using Phenix with the appropriate twin operator. Subsequent model building was performed in Coot (48Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar), and model refinement was performed with Phenix (46Adams P.D. Afonine P.V. Bunkóczi G. Chen V.B. Davis I.W. Echols N.

The model contains one complex (one MqsA dimer complexed with one DNA duplex) with a total of 264 protein residues and 52 nucleotides. The electron density of the bound DNA is shown in supplemental Fig. S1. Analysis of DNA parameters was carried out using the programs Curves+ (49Lavery R. Moakher M. Maddocks J.H. Petkeviciute D. Zakrzewska K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2009; 37: 5917-5929Crossref PubMed Scopus (557) Google Scholar), 3DNA (50Lu X.J. Olson W.K. Nat. Protoc. 2008; 3: 1213-1227Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar), and Entanlge (51Allers J. Shamoo Y. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 75-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Amino acid mutagenesis was carried out using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and all constructs were sequenced (Agencourt). Mutated DNA constructs were purchased as individual complementary oligonucleotides (Integrated DNA Technologies) and then annealed as described previously (44Brown B.L. Page R. Acta Crystallogr. F. 2010; 66: 1060-1063Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). For all NMR studies, the C-terminal domain of MqsA (MqsA-C) was expressed in M9 minimal medium containing selective antibiotics and 4 g/liter d-[13C]glucose and/or 1 g/liter 15NH4Cl (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Cambridge, MA) as the sole carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively. Purification was carried out as described previously (19Brown B.L. Grigoriu S. Kim Y. Arruda J.M. Davenport A. Wood T.K. Peti W. Page R. PLoS Pathog. 2009; 5: e1000706Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The NMR buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.0, 50 mm NaCl, 10% D20) was used for all assignment experiments. MqsA-C was concentrated to 0.5 mm. All experiments were performed at 293 K on a Bruker AvanceII 500-MHz spectrometer equipped with a TCI HCN z-gradient cryoprobe. The sequence-specific backbone assignment was obtained using the following experiments: two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC, two-dimensional 1H,13C HSQC, three-dimensional HNCA, three-dimensional HNCACB, three-dimensional CBCA(CO)NH, three-dimensional (H)CC(CO)NH, and a three-dimensional HNCO spectrum. The NMR spectra were processed with Topspin 1.3 or 2.1 (Bruker, Billerica, MA) and analyzed using the CARA software package (available from the Swiss NMR Web site). Assignments were obtained for more than 94% of all backbone nuclei (13Cα, 13Cβ, 13CO, 15N, and HN). Of the 69 expected backbone amide N-H pairs (4 prolines), 65 were identified; missing ones correspond to two N-terminal cloning artifacts as well as residues Asn97 and Ser112 (supplemental Fig. S2). All chemical shifts were deposited in the BioMagResBank (available on the World Wide Web). An assignment of full-length MqsA is also available (52Papadopoulos E. Billeter M. Gräslund A. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Biomol. NMR Assign. 2007; 1: 217-219Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar). For all DNA interaction measurements, MqsA-C was exchanged into the NMR DNA buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA). Complementary DNA oligonucleotides were also solubilized in NMR DNA buffer and annealed in equimolar concentrations. NMR titration experiments were performed by mixing 15N-MqsA-C and each PmqsRA construct in a 1:1 ratio (100 μm each) and the addition of 10% (v/v) D2O. Two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC spectra (1024 × 128 real points) were recorded to analyze the interaction. Apo-MqsA-C spectra can be readily recorded (four scans). However, due to the high molecular mass of the MqsA-C·DNA complexes (∼32 kDa), either 128 or 256 scans (7.5- or 15-h recording time, respectively) were necessary for a high quality two-dimensional 1H,15N HSQC spectrum. Complementary oligonucleotides labeled with biotin at the 3′ end corresponding to the PmqsRA DNA used in crystallization studies were purchased (Integrated DNA Technologies), solubilized, and annealed as described previously (44Brown B.L. Page R. Acta Crystallogr. F. 2010; 66: 1060-1063Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Also, complementary oligonucleotides corresponding to biotin-labeled PmqsRA-I were purchased and annealed. To determine dissociation constants, labeled WT PmqsRA DNA was incubated with a 10, 20, 40, 70, 100, 150, 200, 400, or 600 nm concentration of either wild type MqsA-F, MqsA-F N97A, MqsA-F R101A, or MqsA-F N97A/R101A (all proteins were purified immediately prior to EMSA experiments). A similar experiment using 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, and 500 nm MqsA-C was also performed. To determine whether MqsA recognizes the PmqsRA DNA via a direct or indirect readout mechanism, 100 fmol of labeled DNA was mixed with a 50-fold excess of MqsA-F and a 200-fold excess of either WT or mutant unlabeled DNA. The binding reactions were incubated at room temperature for 20 min. Samples were then loaded onto a 6% DNA retardation gel (Invitrogen) and subjected to electrophoresis at 4 °C for 75 min and 100 V in TBE (45 mm Tris, pH 8.3, 45 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA) buffer. The DNA was transferred to a nylon membrane at 390 mA for 45 min and subsequently UV-cross-linked at 302 nm. Chemiluminescence was performed with the LightShift chemiluminescent EMSA kit (Pierce), and the samples were detected with a CCD imager (Typhoon 9410 imager). Integrated band volumes were calculated using ImageQuant TL software, and dissociation constants were calculated using Sigmaplot 8.0. All experiments were performed in triplicate except for MqsA-C, which was done in duplicate. The structure of full-length MqsA (MqsA-F; residues 1–131; MqsA is a dimer) bound to the 26-mer DNA fragment corresponding to the palindrome of the mqsRA promoter (referred to hereafter as MqsA·PmqsRA) was determined to 2.1 Å resolution by molecular replacement (Fig. 1, A–D, and supplemental Fig. S1) using two copies of the MqsA N-terminal domain (MqsA-N), two copies of the MqsA C-terminal domain (MqsA-C), and four copies of a short 5-mer DNA duplex as search models. The space group is P41, with one copy of the MqsA·PmqsRA complex per asymmetric unit. The final model contains 264 protein residues and 52 nucleotides (Table 1).TABLE 1Crystallographic data collection and refinement statisticsMqsA·PmqsRAData collectionSpace groupP41Unit cell (Å)a = b = 60.99, c = 148.60Wavelength (Å)0.9788Resolution (Å)aHighest resolution shell data are shown in parentheses.50.0-2.1 (2.14-2.10)Rmerge (%)bRmerge = ΣhklΣi|Ii(hkl) − 〈I(hkl)〉|/ΣhklΣiIi(hkl) where Ii(hkl) is the ith observation of a symmetry-equivalent reflection hkl.0.075 (0.515)Mean I/σ29.13 (2.39)Completeness (%)99.5 (93.5)Redundancy6.7 (3.5)RefinementResolution range (Å)47.15–2.10Rwork (%)17.6Rfree (%)22.76Root mean square deviationBond length (Å)0.008Bond angle (degrees)1.163Average B factor (Å2)Protein27.9Nucleic acid38.8Water29.5Ions30.9Ramachandran plot (%)Favored97.7Allowed2.3Disallowed0a Highest resolution shell data are shown in parentheses.b Rmerge = ΣhklΣi|Ii(hkl) − 〈I(hkl)〉|/ΣhklΣiIi(hkl) where Ii(hkl) is the ith observation of a symmetry-equivalent reflection hkl. Open table in a new tab The structure of the MqsA·PmqsRA complex reveals that a single MqsA dimer binds one PmqsRA DNA duplex using a large, positively charged surface on the undersides of the MqsA-C domains (Fig. 1B; the MqsA-C domain mediates dimerization). The MqsA dimerization axis is approximately perpendicular to the helical axis of DNA and passes through the center of the operator (base pair T14-A14′). Because the dimerization axis possesses nearly perfect 2-fold symmetry, the protein interactions with the two DNA palindrome half-sites are symmetric. The DNA is further enclosed by the MqsA-N domains, which make direct interactions with the DNA phosphate backbone. The interface between the MqsA protein and PmqsRA DNA is extensive, burying a total of 3263 Å2 of solvent-accessible surface area, ∼13% of the solvent-accessible surface area of the entire complex. Complementarity between the DNA and MqsA is achieved by perturbations of the PmqsRA base pairs when compared with ideal B-form DNA. These perturbations resul"

The latter plays an important role in induction of angiogenesis. As such, many human malignancies exhibit TP overexpression that correlates with increased microvessel density, formation of aggressive tumors, and dismal prognosis. Because TP is frequently overexpressed in cancer, pro-drugs were developed that utilize TP activity for their bioactivation to cytotoxic drugs. In this respect, TP is indispensable for the pharmacologic activity of the chemotherapeutic drug capecitabine, as it converts its intermediary metabolite 5′-deoxyfluorouridine to 5-fluorouracil. Thus, loss of TP function confers resistance to the prodrug capecitabine, currently used for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer and breast cancer. However, drug resistance phenomena may frequently emerge that compromise the pharmacologic activity of capecitabine. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to TP-activated prodrugs is an important goal toward the overcoming of such drug resistance phenomena. Here, we discovered that lack of TP protein in drug-resistant tumor cells is due to unsplicing of its pre-mRNA. Advanced bioinformatics identified the family of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins (hnRNP) H/F as candidate splicing factors potentially responsible for impaired TP splicing. Indeed, whereas parental cells lacked nuclear localization of hnRNPs H1/H2 and F, drug-resistant cells harbored marked levels of these splicing factors. Nuclear RNA immunoprecipitation experiments established a strong binding of hnRNP H1/H2 to TP pre-mRNA, hence implicating them in TP splicing. Moreover, introduction of hnRNP H2 into drug-sensitive parental cells recapitulated aberrant TP splicing and 5′-deoxyfluorouridine resistance.

We should like, however, to point out that this substance has already been reported by Levander2, Annersten3 and Bertelsen4. We are at present engaged in a more detailed investigation of its chemical nature. In experiments performed in collaboration with Dr. Hans Bohr, we have confirmed Annersten's finding that the osteogenetic substance can be shaken out from its alcoholic solution with benzene. Furthermore, by saponiflcation we have divided the lipid substances in the bone marrow into (a) the unsaponifiable fraction, (b) the fatty acid fraction and (c) the residual solution after saponification and extraction of (a) and (b). The osteogenetic activity in (a) was very low, that in (b) somewhat higher, while fraction (c) was completely inactive. The investigation is being continued."

Here, we show that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) causes LPCAT1 degradation using the Skp1-Cullin-F-box ubiquitin E3 ligase component, β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP), that polyubiquitinates LPCAT1, thereby targeting the enzyme for proteasomal degradation. LPCAT1 was identified as a phosphoenzyme as Ser178 within a phosphodegron was identified as a putative molecular recognition site for glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) phosphorylation that recruits β-TrCP docking within the enzyme. β-TrCP ubiquitinates LPCAT1 at an acceptor site (Lys221), as substitution of Lys221 with Arg abrogated LPCAT1 polyubiquitination. LPS profoundly reduced immunoreactive LPCAT1 levels and impaired lung surfactant mechanics, effects that were overcome by siRNA to β-TrCP and GSK-3β or LPCAT1 gene transfer, respectively. Thus, LPS appears to destabilize the LPCAT1 protein by GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation within a canonical phosphodegron for β-TrCP docking and site-specific ubiquitination. LPCAT1 is the first lipogenic substrate for β-TrCP, and the results suggest that modulation of the GSK-3β-SCFβTrCP E3 ligase effector pathway might be a unique strategy to optimize dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine levels in sepsis.

Here, we show that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) causes LPCAT1 degradation using the Skp1-Cullin-F-box ubiquitin E3 ligase component, β-transducin repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP), that polyubiquitinates LPCAT1, thereby targeting the enzyme for proteasomal degradation. LPCAT1 was identified as a phosphoenzyme as Ser178 within a phosphodegron was identified as a putative molecular recognition site for glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) phosphorylation that recruits β-TrCP docking within the enzyme. β-TrCP ubiquitinates LPCAT1 at an acceptor site (Lys221), as substitution of Lys221 with Arg abrogated LPCAT1 polyubiquitination. LPS profoundly reduced immunoreactive LPCAT1 levels and impaired lung surfactant mechanics, effects that were overcome by siRNA to β-TrCP and GSK-3β or LPCAT1 gene transfer, respectively. Thus, LPS appears to destabilize the LPCAT1 protein by GSK-3β-mediated phosphorylation within a canonical phosphodegron for β-TrCP docking and site-specific ubiquitination. LPCAT1 is the first lipogenic substrate for β-TrCP, and the results suggest that modulation of the GSK-3β-SCFβTrCP E3 ligase effector pathway might be a unique strategy to optimize dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine levels in sepsis."

IRE1 signaling becomes attenuated under prolonged ER stress. The mechanisms by which this occurs are not well understood. An ER resident protein, Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1), interacts with IRE1 and directly inhibits IRE1 activity. However, little is known about regulation of the BI-1 protein. We show here that bifunctional apoptosis regulator (BAR) functions as an ER-associated RING-type E3 ligase, interacts with BI-1, and promotes proteasomal degradation of BI-1. Overexpression of BAR reduced BI-1 protein levels in a RING-dependent manner. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous BAR increased BI-1 protein levels and enhanced inhibition of IRE1 signaling during ER stress. We also found that the levels of endogenous BAR were reduced under prolonged ER stress. Our findings suggest that post-translational regulation of the BI-1 protein by E3 ligase BAR contributes to the dynamic control of IRE1 signaling during ER stress."

https://openalex.org/W1998735379,"Human group IIA-secreted phospholipase A(2) (sPLA(2)-IIA) is an important regulator of cytokine-mediated inflammatory responses in both in vitro and in vivo models of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, treatment of RA patients with sPLA(2)-IIA inhibitors shows only transient benefit. Using an activity-impaired sPLA(2)-IIA mutant protein (H48Q), we show that up-regulation of TNF-dependent PGE(2) production and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) induction by exogenous sPLA(2)-IIA in RA fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) is independent of its enzyme function. Selective cytosolic phospholipase A(2)-α (cPLA(2)-α) inhibitors abrogate TNF/sPLA(2)-IIA-mediated PGE(2) production without affecting COX-2 levels, indicating arachidonic acid (AA) flux to COX-2 occurs exclusively through TNF-mediated activation of cPLA(2)-α. Nonetheless, exogenous sPLA(2)-IIA, but not H48Q, stimulates both AA mobilization from FLSs and microparticle-derived AA release that is not used for COX-2-dependent PGE(2) production. sPLA(2)-IIA-mediated AA production is inhibited by pharmacological blockade of sPLA(2)-IIA but not cPLA(2)-α. Exogenous H48Q alone, like sPLA(2)-IIA, increases COX-2 protein levels without inducing PGE(2) production. Unlike TNF, sPLA(2)-IIA alone does not rapidly mobilize NF-κB or activate phosphorylation of p38 MAPK, two key regulators of COX-2 protein expression, but does activate the ERK1/2 pathway. Thus, sPLA(2)-IIA regulates AA flux through the cPLA(2)-α/COX-2 pathway in RA FLSs by up-regulating steady state levels of these biosynthetic enzymes through an indirect mechanism, rather than direct provision of substrate to the pathway. Inhibitors that have been optimized for their potency in enzyme activity inhibition alone may not adequately block the activity-independent function of sPLA(2)-IIA."

IntroductionTetralin (1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene) is a bicyclic molecule composed of an aromatic and an alicyclic moiety, which is found at low concentrations in different crude oils, and it is also industrially produced for its use as an organic solvent. Biodegradation of tetralin has been characterized most extensively in Sphingomonas macrogolitabida strain TFA. The genes required for tetralin biodegradation (thn genes) have been sequenced, and the functions of the encoded proteins have been characterized to elucidate the biodegradation pathway (1Hernáez M.J.

Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2026-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) that yields pyruvate and pimelate, which is subsequently metabolized via β-oxidation (5López-Sánchez A. Floriano B. Andújar E. Hernáez M.J. Santero E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Rieske type oxygenases are multicomponent enzymes known to initiate the oxidative biodegradation of various environmentally hazardous aromatic compounds in bacteria, such as crude oil components, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and heterocyclic aromatic compounds, in a reaction requiring oxygen and an external electron supply (6Mason J.R. Cammack R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 277-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In this reaction, the electrons are transferred from NAD(P)H via flavin and [2Fe-2S] redox centers to the terminal oxygenase component that has the catalytic active site. Tetralin dioxygenase is encoded by the thnA1 and thnA2 genes, whereas the ferredoxin and the ferredoxin reductase components of the electron transfer system are encoded by thnA3 and thnA4, respectively. According to the number of components and the nature of the redox centers of the electron transport chain, bacterial oxygenases have been classified into three main classes, classes I, II, and III (7Batie C.J. Ballou D.P. Correll C.C. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 543-556Google Scholar, 8Butler C.S. Mason J.R. Adv. Microb.

The tetralin dioxygenase system belongs to class III (4Moreno-Ruiz E. Hernáez M.J. Martínez-Pérez O. Santero E. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2026-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).The thn genes involved in utilization of tetralin as a carbon and energy source by Sphingomonas macrogolitabida strain TFA cluster together and are arranged into three closely linked operons, two of which contain internal promoters (Fig. 1). With the exception of the weak constitutive thnR promoter, transcription from the thn promoters is co-regulated at a transcriptional level in a complex regulatory manner. First, thn expression is specifically induced in the presence of tetralin but prevented if other preferential carbon sources are available, implying that additional signals, such as the physiological status of the cell or catabolite repression, might be integrated into the regulatory system (5López-Sánchez A. Floriano B. Andújar E. Hernáez M.J. Santero E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 10Martínez-Pérez O. Moreno-Ruiz E. Floriano B. Santero E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6101-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Second, oxidation and reduction of the ferredoxin component ThnA3 apparently act as a molecular switch to control thn gene expression. This conclusion is based on the observation that under circumstances where the transfer of electrons from the ferredoxin to the tetralin dioxygenase is blocked (i.e. in the absence of a suitable substrate for the dioxygenase or in a mutant lacking tetralin dioxygenase), reduced ThnA3 would accumulate, and thn gene expression would be prevented. It has been proposed that this system will avoid gratuitous induction by potential inducers that are not substrates of the terminal oxygenase (11Martínez-Pérez O. López-Sánchez A. Reyes-Ramírez F. Floriano B. Santero E. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 3768-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).Transcription from the regulated thn promoters requires a positive control by regulatory proteins. Previous genetic analysis showed that S. macrogolitabida mutant strains defective in either thnR or thnY were unable to activate thn gene transcription (5López-Sánchez A. Floriano B. Andújar E. Hernáez M.J. Santero E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 10Martínez-Pérez O. Moreno-Ruiz E. Floriano B. Santero E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6101-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). ThnR is a LysR type of transcriptional activator whose regulatory mechanism starts to emerge. Several lines of evidence, including semiquantitative and quantitative expression analysis by RT-PCR of several thn genes, footprint analysis, and DNA binding assays, have shown that transcription from the PB, PC, PH, and PM promoters is positively regulated by ThnR in response to tetralin (5López-Sánchez A. Floriano B. Andújar E. Hernáez M.J. Santero E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 12López-Sánchez A. Rivas-Marín E. Martínez-Pérez O. Floriano B. Santero E. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 73: 1086-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that ThnR binds to palindromic sites present at each of the four thn promoter regions in order to activate transcription. Like most LysR type activators, ThnR apparently binds as a tetramer to contiguous high affinity and low affinity sites in each promoter region. Additionally, a mechanism of co-regulation of the transcription from the closely located divergent thnB and thnC promoters has been reported, which involves the formation of a DNA loop and a higher order structure maintained by interaction between ThnR molecules bound to each promoter region (12López-Sánchez A. Rivas-Marín E. Martínez-Pérez O. Floriano B. Santero E. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 73: 1086-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), thus generating an octameric protein structure. As shown in Fig. 1, thnR is located downstream of the structural thnC, thnA3, and thnA4 genes. Expression analysis by quantitative RT-PCR has shown that thnR has a low constitutive transcription level from its own promoter, but its transcription is also induced by tetralin from the thnC promoter (12López-Sánchez A. Rivas-Marín E. Martínez-Pérez O. Floriano B. Santero E. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 73: 1086-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).However, unlike ThnR, ThnY does not show homology to any reported transcriptional regulator. In fact, ThnY shows a clear homology to oxidoreductases that participate as electron transfer components to terminal oxygenases. Apart from its essential requirement for in vivo thn gene transcription, nothing is known about the role and the physiological partners of ThnY. It would be interesting to know why and how a protein similar to ferredoxin reductases is essential for thn gene transcription. In this report, we have begun to investigate the function of ThnY. We present here the purification of ThnY and some of its molecular, biochemical, and functional properties and propose a regulatory role of ThnY as modulator of the activity of the transcriptional activator ThnR.DISCUSSIONPrevious mutational analyses had shown that the product encoded by thnY was essential for tetralin biodegradation capacity in S. macrogolitabida strain TFA. Interestingly, although its sequence resembled those of ferredoxin reductases involved in the first step of the catabolic pathway, its role is not catalytic but regulatory. ThnY is essential for expressing the tetralin biodegradation capability, particularly for transcription from the four promoters that are induced in the presence of tetraline (5López-Sánchez A. Floriano B. Andújar E. Hernáez M.J. Santero E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 10Martínez-Pérez O. Moreno-Ruiz E. Floriano B. Santero E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6101-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12López-Sánchez A. Rivas-Marín E. Martínez-Pérez O. Floriano B. Santero E. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 73: 1086-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). In an effort to understand the role of ThnY in regulating tetralin biodegradation genes, we have analyzed its expression pattern and purified and analyzed a number of biochemical and functional characteristics of a His-tagged version of this protein.Antibodies against ThnY that were obtained using ThnY-His6 as the antigen allowed us to make semiquantitative estimations of the in vivo ThnY concentration under different conditions. The results (Fig. 2) were fully concordant with the expression pattern exhibited by the thnR regulatory gene (12López-Sánchez A. Rivas-Marín E. Martínez-Pérez O. Floriano B. Santero E. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 73: 1086-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and indicated that there was a low but detectable basal expression under non-inducing conditions, which increased in a ThnR-dependent manner when cells grew under inducing conditions. Given the close proximity of thnY to thnR, whose reading frames are separated by 7 bp, and their expression pattern, we conclude that thnR and thnY are cotranscribed. Thus, under non-inducing conditions, both regulatory genes are constitutively transcribed from PR in a short transcriptional unit comprising just thnRY, which would allow the production of sufficient amounts of the regulatory proteins to initiate the induction process in the presence of tetralin. Under inducing conditions, ThnR and ThnY would activate transcription from the highest affinity promoter, PC, which in turn results in autoactivation of thnRY by transcriptional read-through. The increase in the in vivo ThnR and ThnY concentrations would allow full activation of transcription of the remaining genes from the lower affinity promoters PB, PH, and PM (12López-Sánchez A. Rivas-Marín E. Martínez-Pérez O. Floriano B. Santero E. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 73: 1086-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).Sequence analysis indicated that ThnY is most similar to ferredoxin reductases of class III, according to the biochemical classification proposed by Batie et al. (7Batie C.J. Ballou D.P. Correll C.C. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 543-556Google Scholar). Enzymes of this class are components of the electron transfer system of ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases that catalyze the initial dioxygenation reaction of the aromatic benzene rings and play an important role in the degradation of various environmental pollutants. They all contain a plant type [2Fe-2S] cluster and FAD as prosthetic groups. Electrons are transferred from the pyridine nucleotides, through the FAD and the [2Fe-2S] cluster, to an intermediary Rieske type ferredoxin, which in turn transfers the electron to the dioxygenase. Purified ThnY is an orange-brown protein and contains flavin and a plant type iron-sulfur cluster as redox centers, as indicated by its distinctive visible absorbance (Fig. 4B) and EPR spectrum (Fig. 5C). The flavin, which is non-covalently bound, was identified as flavin adenine dinucleotide by using thin layer chromatography (Fig. 5B) and estimated to be in equimolecular concentration with the protein (Fig. 5A).Both cofactors seem to be functional in ThnY because both can be readily reduced in the presence of an excess of dithionite (Figs. 4B and 5C). Of course, the observed reduction is artificial because the dithionite is fully reducing all of the reducible centers at the same time. However, because ThnY can be reduced, it is tempting to speculate that its redox state may influence its regulatory function. Regulation of gene expression mediated by transcriptional factors or modulatory proteins that function as redox-sensitive switches has been reported in different systems (34Bauer C.E. Elsen S. Bird T.H. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1999; 53: 495-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). These include essential processes, such as photosynthesis in purple and non-purple phototrophic bacteria (35Elsen S. Jaubert M. Pignol D. Giraud E. Mol. Microbiol. 2005; 57: 17-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 36Dubbs J.M. Tabita F.R. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2004; 28: 353-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), response to oxidative stress (37Zheng M. Storz G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2000; 59: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar), nitrogen fixation in free living organisms through NifL (38Hill S. Austin S. Eydmann T. Jones T. Dixon R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6041-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), or anaerobic metabolism through FNR (40Unden G. Schirawski J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 205-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The common feature in these regulators is that they control gene expression in response to the presence of oxygen or oxidative stress, and the function of some of them, like FNR, is directly regulated by oxygen. However, in the case of ThnY, oxygen (or its absence) cannot be a triggering signal because thn genes are similarly regulated in aerobiosis or in anaerobiosis. 3F. Reyes-Ramírez and E. Santero, unpublished data.Unlike the typical ferredoxin reductases, which show activity in the presence of either NADH or NADPH and which are able to deliver electrons from these reductants to artificial electron acceptors, such as cytochrome c, DCPIP, or ferricyanide, purified ThnY was unable to reduce cytochrome c or ferricyanide and showed barely detectable diaphorase activity using DCPIP as the electron acceptor. The lack of these activities may be explained by the very inefficient reduction of ThnY when using any of the pyridine nucleotides as the electron donor (Fig. 6). As a ferredoxin reductase of the dioxygenase systems, ThnY should receive electrons from pyridine nucleotides. However, the ThnY amino acid sequence showed that the fingerprint sequence GGXGXXP in the C-terminal domain, which is proposed to be involved in the binding of the adenosine-5′-phosphate groups of NADH or 2′-phospho-AMP of NADPH, is not conserved in ThnY (22Karplus P.A. Daniels M.J. Herriott J.R. Science. 1991; 251: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). In addition, where structures are available, the conserved Pro from the former signature and the Cys residue from the conserved motif (yXCGp) are shown to contact the bound nicotinamide moiety. A mutant form of a ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase with the Cys changed to Ser displayed decreased rates of flavin reduction by NADPH and lower yields of intermediate pyridine nuc1eotide:flavin charge transfer species (41Aliverti A. Piubelli L. Zanetti G. Lübberstedt T. Herrmann R.G. Curti B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 6374-6380Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In ThnY, Phe substitutes Cys. These substitutions in the conserved NAD(P)H binding domain of ThnY may have an effect on the precise mode in which the pyridine nucleotide is bound, thus preventing ThnY from efficiently accepting electrons from it. These substitutions may actually be important for the correct function of ThnY to prevent it from being readily reduced under non-appropriate conditions if the NAD(P)H pool is sufficiently high. Thus, if the function of ThnY depends on its redox state, signals affecting thn expression can be transduced to ThnY by accumulating a so far unknown physiological ThnY reductant.Inclusion of ThnY in the EMSAs (Fig. 7) had weak but very important effects on ThnR binding to the thnB-thnC intergenic region. In first place, protein-DNA complexes were formed with significantly higher affinity in the presence of ThnY. Second, the diffused higher order complexes observed in the absence of ThnY, which are indicative of unstable complexes (12López-Sánchez A. Rivas-Marín E. Martínez-Pérez O. Floriano B. Santero E. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 73: 1086-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), were substituted by a more defined band in its presence, which suggests that ThnY stabilizes the ThnR-promoter complex at this region. These effects clearly indicated a direct positive role of oxidized ThnY in regulating thn gene transcription. Given the characteristics of ThnY, its presumed function is to modulate the function of the LysR type transcriptional activator ThnR. Because the oxidized form of ThnY is active (Fig. 7), its maximum effect is observed when the ratio of ThnY monomer to ThnR tetramer is at least 2 (data not shown), and it does not change the footprint produced by ThnR by itself, we propose that its regulatory function is not catalytic but involves formation of a transcriptionally competent ThnR-ThnY complex through protein-protein interactions. Although most LysR type regulators directly sense the environmental signals to which they respond, a number of examples have been reported in which auxiliary proteins are also required to regulate transcription (18Porrúa O. García-Jaramillo M. Santero E. Govantes F. Mol. Microbiol. 2007; 66: 410-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 42Heil G. Stauffer L.T. Stauffer G.V.

Lett. 2009; 300: 222-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar); such a two-component composition allows the regulatory system to respond to additional signals. In the case of the thn genes, transcription is subjected to carbon catabolite repression and is also responding to a modulation system exerted by the reduced form of the ferredoxin ThnA3, which prevents thn gene induction if the inducer molecule cannot be efficiently metabolized by the tetralin biodegradation pathway, thus preventing gratuitous induction (11Martínez-Pérez O. López-Sánchez A. Reyes-Ramírez F. Floriano B. Santero E. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 3768-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). These additional signals may be integrated in the regulatory system by affecting the functional state of ThnY, presumably by modifying its redox state.In the last few years, a number of metabolic enzymes have been reported to have a direct role in regulation of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic gene expression in addition to its enzymatic activity. This principle of a dual function of one protein is envisioned as a way of linking cellular metabolism to gene expression (46Hall D.A. Zhu H. Zhu X. Royce T. Gerstein M. Snyder M.

ThnY represents the first example of an electron transport component that has evolved to lose its capacity of accepting electrons from pyridine nucleotides and instead has been recruited to play a direct role in regulating transcription from target promoters. IntroductionTetralin (1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene) is a bicyclic molecule composed of an aromatic and an alicyclic moiety, which is found at low concentrations in different crude oils, and it is also industrially produced for its use as an organic solvent. Biodegradation of tetralin has been characterized most extensively in Sphingomonas macrogolitabida strain TFA. The genes required for tetralin biodegradation (thn genes) have been sequenced, and the functions of the encoded proteins have been characterized to elucidate the biodegradation pathway (1Hernáez M.J.

Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2026-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) that yields pyruvate and pimelate, which is subsequently metabolized via β-oxidation (5López-Sánchez A. Floriano B. Andújar E. Hernáez M.J. Santero E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Rieske type oxygenases are multicomponent enzymes known to initiate the oxidative biodegradation of various environmentally hazardous aromatic compounds in bacteria, such as crude oil components, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and heterocyclic aromatic compounds, in a reaction requiring oxygen and an external electron supply (6Mason J.R. Cammack R. Annu. Rev. Microbiol. 1992; 46: 277-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). In this reaction, the electrons are transferred from NAD(P)H via flavin and [2Fe-2S] redox centers to the terminal oxygenase component that has the catalytic active site. Tetralin dioxygenase is encoded by the thnA1 and thnA2 genes, whereas the ferredoxin and the ferredoxin reductase components of the electron transfer system are encoded by thnA3 and thnA4, respectively. According to the number of components and the nature of the redox centers of the electron transport chain, bacterial oxygenases have been classified into three main classes, classes I, II, and III (7Batie C.J. Ballou D.P. Correll C.C. Müller F. Chemistry and Biochemistry of Flavoenzymes. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1991: 543-556Google Scholar, 8Butler C.S. Mason J.R. Adv. Microb. Physiol. 1997; 38: 47-84Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Ferraro D.J. Gakhar L. Ramaswamy S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 338: 175-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The tetralin dioxygenase system belongs to class III (4Moreno-Ruiz E. Hernáez M.J. Martínez-Pérez O. Santero E. J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 2026-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).The thn genes involved in utilization of tetralin as a carbon and energy source by Sphingomonas macrogolitabida strain TFA cluster together and are arranged into three closely linked operons, two of which contain internal promoters (Fig. 1). With the exception of the weak constitutive thnR promoter, transcription from the thn promoters is co-regulated at a transcriptional level in a complex regulatory manner. First, thn expression is specifically induced in the presence of tetralin but prevented if other preferential carbon sources are available, implying that additional signals, such as the physiological status of the cell or catabolite repression, might be integrated into the regulatory system (5López-Sánchez A. Floriano B. Andújar E. Hernáez M.J. Santero E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 10Martínez-Pérez O. Moreno-Ruiz E. Floriano B. Santero E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6101-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Second, oxidation and reduction of the ferredoxin component ThnA3 apparently act as a molecular switch to control thn gene expression. This conclusion is based on the observation that under circumstances where the transfer of electrons from the ferredoxin to the tetralin dioxygenase is blocked (i.e. in the absence of a suitable substrate for the dioxygenase or in a mutant lacking tetralin dioxygenase), reduced ThnA3 would accumulate, and thn gene expression would be prevented. It has been proposed that this system will avoid gratuitous induction by potential inducers that are not substrates of the terminal oxygenase (11Martínez-Pérez O. López-Sánchez A. Reyes-Ramírez F. Floriano B. Santero E. J. Bacteriol. 2007; 189: 3768-3775Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).Transcription from the regulated thn promoters requires a positive control by regulatory proteins. Previous genetic analysis showed that S. macrogolitabida mutant strains defective in either thnR or thnY were unable to activate thn gene transcription (5López-Sánchez A. Floriano B. Andújar E. Hernáez M.J. Santero E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 10Martínez-Pérez O. Moreno-Ruiz E. Floriano B. Santero E. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 6101-6109Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). ThnR is a LysR type of transcriptional activator whose regulatory mechanism starts to emerge. Several lines of evidence, including semiquantitative and quantitative expression analysis by RT-PCR of several thn genes, footprint analysis, and DNA binding assays, have shown that transcription from the PB, PC, PH, and PM promoters is positively regulated by ThnR in response to tetralin (5López-Sánchez A. Floriano B. Andújar E. Hernáez M.J. Santero E. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2010; 76: 110-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 12López-Sánchez A. Rivas-Marín E. Martínez-Pérez O. Floriano B. Santero E. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 73: 1086-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). It has recently been shown that ThnR binds to palindromic sites present at each of the four thn promoter regions in order to activate transcription. Like most LysR type activators, ThnR apparently binds as a tetramer to contiguous high affinity and low affinity sites in each promoter region. Additionally, a mechanism of co-regulation of the transcription from the closely located divergent thnB and thnC promoters has been reported, which involves the formation of a DNA loop and a higher order structure maintained by interaction between ThnR molecules bound to each promoter region (12López-Sánchez A. Rivas-Marín E. Martínez-Pérez O. Floriano B. Santero E. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 73: 1086-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar), thus generating an octameric protein structure. As shown in Fig. 1, thnR is located downstream of the structural thnC, thnA3, and thnA4 genes. Expression analysis by quantitative RT-PCR has shown that thnR has a low constitutive transcription level from its own promoter, but its transcription is also induced by tetralin from the thnC promoter (12López-Sánchez A. Rivas-Marín E. Martínez-Pérez O. Floriano B. Santero E. Mol. Microbiol. 2009; 73: 1086-1100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar).However, unlike ThnR, ThnY does not show homology to any reported transcriptional regulator. In fact, ThnY shows a clear homology to oxidoreductases that participate as electron transfer components to terminal oxygenases. Apart from its essential requirement for in vivo thn gene transcription, nothing is known about the role and the physiological partners of ThnY. It would be interesting to know why and how a protein similar to ferredoxin reductases is essential for thn gene transcription. In this report, we have begun to investigate the function of ThnY. We present here the purification of ThnY and some of its molecular, biochemical, and functional properties and propose a regulatory role of ThnY as modulator of the activity of the transcriptional activator ThnR."

https://openalex.org/W1988593446,"The bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscL is the best-studied mechanosensor, thus serving as a paradigm of how a protein senses and responds to mechanical force. Models for the transition of Escherichia coli MscL from closed to open states propose a tilting of the transmembrane domains in the plane of the membrane, suggesting dynamic protein-lipid interactions. Here, we used a rapid in vivo assay to assess the function of channels that were post-translationally modified at several different sites in a region just distal to the cytoplasmic end of the second transmembrane helix. We utilized multiple probes with various affinities for the membrane environment. The in vivo functional data, combined with site-directed mutagenesis, single-channel analyses, and tryptophan fluorescence measurements, confirmed that lipid interactions within this region are critical for MscL gating. The data suggest a model in which this region acts as an anchor for the transmembrane domain tilting during gating. Furthermore, the conservation of analogous motifs among many other channels suggests a conserved protein-lipid dynamic mechanism."

The innate immune system provides a rapid and nonspecific defense at biological boundaries prone to infection. Essential elements involved in this immediate host response are antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) 2The abbreviations used are: AMP, antimicrobial peptide; FXII, factor XII; FXI, factor XI; PK, plasma kallikrein; HK, high molecular weight kininogen; TH, Todd-Hewitt broth; MF, multiplication factor; NET, neutrophil extracellular trap; Tricine, N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine; aPTT, activated partial thromboplastin time. and complement components (1Lai Y.

The complement system can be activated through three different pathways; the classical, alternative, and lectin pathways (4Rus H. Cudrici C. Niculescu F. Immunol. Res. 2005; 33: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). Although the initiation of these complement cascades differs, they all converge at the level of C3 with the generation of several C3 peptide fragments including the anaphylatoxin C3a. This proinflammatory peptide has a number of biological effects, such as enhancement of vascular permeability, contraction of smooth muscle cells, and histamine release from mast cells (5Haas P.J. van Strijp J. Immunol. Res. 2007; 37: 161-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). C3a also exerts a potent antimicrobial activity, a property that has been highly conserved from invertebrates to humans (6Nordahl E.A. Rydengård V. Nyberg P. Nitsche D.P. Mörgelin M. Malmsten M.

Acta. 2007; 1768: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Another branch of innate immunity is represented by the human contact system, which generates AMPs upon activation (9Frick I.M. Åkesson P. Herwald H. Mörgelin M. Malmsten M. Nägler D.K. Björck L. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5569-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This system comprises three serine proteinases: factor XII (FXII), factor XI (FXI), and plasma kallikrein (PK), and the nonenzymatic cofactor high molecular weight kininogen (HK) (10Bhoola K.D. Figueroa C.D. Worthy K. Pharmacol. Rev. 1992; 44: 1-80PubMed Google Scholar, 11Colman R.W. Schmaier A.H. Blood. 1997; 90: 3819-3843Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Joseph K. Kaplan A.P. Adv. Immunol. 2005; 86: 159-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). HK consists of six domains: the cystatin-like domains D1–D3; the bradykinin-containing domain D4; domain D5, which binds to negatively charged surfaces; and domain D6, which binds FXI and PK (see Fig. 2A, schematic). Classical consequences of contact activation are cleavage of HK leading to the release of the potent proinflammatory peptide bradykinin and the initiation of the intrinsic pathway of coagulation through FXI activation. When activated at the surface of significant human bacterial pathogens, including Streptococcus pyogenes, further processing of HK results in the generation of antibacterial fragments from domain D3 of HK, mainly involving a 26-amino acid sequence (9Frick I.M.

S. pyogenes is a common and important human bacterial pathogen causing a wide spectrum of diseases ranging from uncomplicated throat and skin infections to life-threatening invasive conditions, such as necrotizing fasciitis, septicaemia, and toxic shock syndrome (13Bisno A.L.

Sjöholm A.G. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). The sic gene shows a high degree of variation among different M1 strains, and nearly 300 alleles are known (25Stockbauer K.E. Grigsby D. Pan X. Fu Y.X. Mejia L.M. Cravioto A. Musser J.M. Proc. Natl.

SIC also binds to and interferes with the activity of several antibacterial proteins and peptides such as lysozyme, LL-37, members of the defensin family, and the chemokine MIG/CXCL9 (26Egesten A.

Recently, SIC was also shown to inhibit an antibacterial peptide produced by Streptococcus salivarius, a bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (30Minami M. Ohmori D. Tatsuno I. Isaka M. Kawamura Y. Ohta M. Hasegawa T. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2009; 298: 67-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). In the present work, we demonstrate that SIC interferes with innate immunity functions of the complement and contact systems. As a consequence, SIC enhances the virulence of S. pyogenes by promoting growth in human plasma and bacterial dissemination in a mouse model of sepsis. The S. pyogenes strain AP1 (40/58), was from the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Streptococci (Prague, Czech Republic). The mutant strain SIC− has been described previously (29Frick I.M. Åkesson P. Rasmussen M. Schmidtchen A. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 16561-16566Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Bacteria were cultivated in Todd-Hewitt broth (TH; Difco) at 37 °C. Fresh frozen plasma from healthy individuals was obtained from the blood bank at Lund University Hospital (Lund, Sweden) and kept at −80 °C until use. Human plasma depleted of HK, PK, FXII, or FXI, respectively, was purchased from George King BioMedical, Inc. (Overland Park, KS). Bacterial cultivation in plasma was performed as follows. 10 μl of an overnight bacterial culture in TH was added to 250 μl plasma, and bacteria were left to grow at 37 °C. At various time points, including time 0, growth was monitored by plating appropriate dilutions of the bacterial solution on TH agar plates. Plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C, and the number of cfu were determined. The multiplication factor (MF) was calculated by dividing the number of cfu at the individual time points with the number of cfu at time point zero. Bacteria grown for 8 h in plasma (undiluted or diluted 1:1 in TH) were collected by centrifugation. Plasma supernatants were analyzed for SIC content by ELISA. Supernatants were also precipitated with 5% TCA for 30 min on ice followed by centrifugation at 15,000 × g (4 °C for 20 min). Precipitated material was dissolved in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. The bacterial cells were washed with PBS, and bound proteins were eluted with 0.1 m glycine-HCl, pH 2.0. The pH of the eluted material was raised to 7.5 with the addition of 1 m Tris. Eluted proteins were TCA-precipitated and analyzed with SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Human HK was purchased from Kordia. The synthetic peptides based on sequences in domain D3 of HK were described previously (31Herwald H. Hasan A.A. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Schmaier A.H. Müller-Esterl W. J. Biol.

LL-37 (LLGDFFRKSKEKIGKEFKRIVQRIKDFLRNLVPRTES) and peptide HKH20 (479HKHGHGHGKHKNKGKKNGKH498 in domain D5 of HK) were synthesized by Innovagen AB (Lund, Sweden). The complement peptide C3a was from Calbiochem, and rabbit anti-C3 was from Serotec. Protein SIC was purified from the S. pyogenes strain AP1 as described (24Åkesson P. Sjöholm A.G. Björck L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1081-1088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Polyclonal antisera to protein SIC and NAT26 were raised in rabbits. HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was purchased from Pierce, and HRP-conjugated protein A was from Sigma. FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG F(ab′)2 was purchased from Sigma, and anti-NAT26 F(ab′)2 fragments were prepared as described (9Frick I.M. Åkesson P. Herwald H. Mörgelin M. Malmsten M. Nägler D.K. Björck L. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5569-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Polyclonal anti-SIC IgG was affinity-purified using protein A-Sepharose (GE Healthcare), and the FabRICATOR® Kit (Genovis) was then utilized for preparation and purification of F(ab′)2 antibody fragments. Proteins were radiolabeled with 125I using iodobeads (Pierce) as described by the manufacturer. Binding of radiolabeled protein to bacteria was performed as described (32Björck L. Kronvall G. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 969-974PubMed Google Scholar). Microtiter plates (Maxisorb, NUNC, Denmark) were coated with peptides spanning the HK domain D3 (0.5 μg/ml). After washing with PBST (PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20), the plates were incubated with protein SIC in a serial dilution (2n; starting concentration, 5 μg/ml). Bound protein was detected with a polyclonal rabbit antibody against protein SIC (1:500), followed by HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (1:5000). All incubations were done at 37 °C for 1 h and followed by a washing step. Substrate solution, 0.1% diammonium-2,2-azino-bis-(3-ethyl-2,3-dihydrobenzthiazoline)-6-sulfonate, 0.012% H2O2 in 100 mm citric acid, 100 mm NaH2PO4, pH 4.5, was added and the change in absorbance at 405 nm was determined after 30 min. Plates were also coated with plasma supernatants from bacterial growth, and the content of SIC in the samples was determined as above. SDS-PAGE was performed as described by Laemmli (33Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207487) Google Scholar) using a polyacrylamide concentration of 10% and 3.3% cross-linking or a Tricine-SDS/PAGE system was used (34Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10499) Google Scholar). Separated proteins were transferred to PVDF membranes (Amersham Biosciences). Membranes were blocked with PBST containing 5% dry milk powder (blocking buffer), incubated with primary antibody (rabbit anti-SIC, 1:1000) in blocking buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. Following a washing step with PBST, the membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies (HRP-conjugated protein A, 1:5000) in blocking buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. The membranes were washed, and bound antibodies were detected by chemiluminescence. When radiolabeled SIC was analyzed, gels were dried, and radioactivity was visualized by autoradiography using Kodak x-Omat AR films and regular intensifying screens. Peptides were also directly applied to PVDF membranes using a Milliblot-D system (Millipore). Membranes were blocked in TBS (0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl) containing 3% bovine serum albumin, incubated with 125I-labeled protein SIC for 3 h, and washed with TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. Autoradiography was carried out as described above. AP1 bacteria were grown to mid-log phase in TH, washed, and diluted in 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 5 mm glucose. 50 μl of bacterial solution (2 × 106 cfu/ml) was incubated with NAT26, LL-37, HKH20, or C3a at various concentrations for 1 h at 37 °C. In subsequent experiments, bacteria were incubated with bactericidal concentrations of the peptides together with various concentrations of protein SIC. The bactericidal activity was quantified by plating serial dilutions of the incubation mixtures on TH agar, incubated overnight at 37 °C, and the number of cfu were determined. S. pyogenes AP1 bacteria were cultivated overnight at 37 °C, washed, and resuspended in PBS (final concentration of 2 × 108 cfu/ml). 400 μl of the bacterial solution (8 × 107 cfu) was incubated with 400 μl PBS or plasma together with various concentrations of protein SIC for 1 h at 37 °C. The bacterial cells were collected, washed with PBS, and resuspended in 75 μl PBS. Then, 25 μl bacterial solution (2.6 × 107 cfu) was incubated with rabbit anti-NAT26 F(ab′)2 fragments (0.2 mg/ml) or rabbit anti-C3 (0.1 mg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. Following a washing step with PBS, the bacterial cells were incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG F(ab′)2 fragments (11 μg/ml) for 30 min at room temperature. After washing with PBS, bacteria were resuspended in PBS, and samples were analyzed on a FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson), and 100,000 events were acquired using logarithmic settings. Data were analyzed using histogram plots of FITC fluorescence intensity acquired in Cell Quest Pro software. AP1 bacteria were grown to early logarithmic phase (A620 nm ∼ 0.5), washed, and diluted in PBS to 1 × 108 cfu/ml. Female Balb/c mice (10 weeks old) were anesthetized with isofluorane and injected subcutaneously in an air pouch on the neck with 200 μl of the bacterial solution (2 × 107 cfu/animal) or with 200 μl PBS (control group). At 8 and 20 h post-infection, 200 μl protein SIC (200 μg/dose) or PBS was injected intraperitoneally in infected animals. (Mice in the control group were injected with PBS.) At 30 h post-infection, animals were terminally anesthetized with isofluorane, and blood was drawn by cardiac puncture into polypropylene tubes containing one-tenth volume of 3.8% trisodium citrate. Following centrifugation, the separated plasma was collected. The concentration of IL-6 in the plasma was determined using an ELISA kit (Invitrogen), and clotting times were measured in a coagulometer (Amelung). For the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), 50 μl of plasma was prewarmed at 37 °C for 60 s, incubated with 50 μl DAPTTIN (Technoclone) for 60 s, followed by the addition of 50 μl of 30 mm CaCl2, and the time to form a clot was measured. For determination of bacterial dissemination, the spleens were removed, kept on ice, and homogenized in PBS, and the materials were plated on TH agar and incubated overnight at 37 °C, and the number of cfu were determined. p values were determined by using the Mann-Whitney U test. The animal experiments were approved by the regional ethic committee for animal experimentation (permit M220-08). The S. pyogenes strains AP1 and SIC− were grown overnight at 37 °C. Ten μl from these cultures were inoculated into 250 μl of citrated plasma (1:1 in TH), and bacteria were allowed to grow at 37 °C for 20 h in Eppendorf tubes. The bacterial cells were washed twice in PBS supplemented with goat serum to a final concentration of 1% (wash buffer). Bacteria were then incubated for 30 min on ice with polyclonal rabbit anti-SIC IgG F(ab′)2 fragments (0.1 mg/ml), washed with wash buffer, and incubated with secondary fluorochrome-conjugated goat anti-rabbit F(ab′)2 fragments (Alexa Fluor 594; Invitrogen) (1:600), for 30 min on ice. The bacterial cells were washed with wash buffer, and bound antibodies were visualized in a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted fluorescence microscope equipped with a Hamamatsu C4742–95 cooled CCD camera, using a Plan Apochromat 100× objective with a numerical aperture of 1.4 (Nikon)). The software used for acquisition was NIS-Elements (version 3.0; Nikon). The same exposure time was used for all images, and during post-processing, all images were treated identically. Negative staining of AP1 bacteria incubated with PBS, plasma, or plasma with protein SIC (see above) was performed with 0.75% uranyl formate as described (35Roth J. Bendayan M. Orci L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1978; 26: 1074-1081Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar). Specimens were examined in a Jeol JEM 1200 EX transmission electron microscope operated at 60 kV accelerating voltage. Digital images were recorded with a Gatan Multiscan 791 CCD camera. Amino acids 261–370 in the D3 domain of HK was aligned with human cystatin F (36Schüttelkopf A.W. Hamilton G. Watts C. van Aalten D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16570-16575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and subjected to a Swiss model (37Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4531) Google Scholar) automated protein homology modeling using cystatin F (Protein Data Bank code 2CH9, chain A) as the template. The model was edited and visualized using VMD (version 1.8.7) (38Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graphics. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (39742) Google Scholar) and Tachyon Ray tracer (39Stone, J. E., (1998) An Efficient Library for Parallel Ray Tracing and Animation. M.Sc. thesis, Missouri University of Science and Technology, Rolla, MO.Google Scholar). To investigate the importance of contact activation in controlling bacterial growth, the S. pyogenes isolate AP1 (a strain of the M1 serotype used throughout this study) was cultivated in human plasma deficient of the various contact factors. As compared with normal plasma, the growth rate was enhanced in plasma that was deficient of PK, FXII, or HK (Fig. 1A). After 8 h of growth, the bacterial numbers were significantly higher in plasma lacking either of these contact factors (Fig. 1A, inset), suggesting that the generation of antibacterial peptide fragments from HK was affected. Factor XI triggers the intrinsic pathway of coagulation but does not participate in the cleavage of HK, and the growth of AP1 bacteria in FXI deficient plasma was the same as in normal plasma (Fig. 1A). The complement cascade is another proteolytic system that is activated at sites of infection. Therefore, the contribution of this system in reducing the multiplication of S. pyogenes was examined by performing growth experiments in human serum. Compared with plasma, AP1 bacteria grew better in serum, and in complement-inactivated serum (heated to 56 °C), a further increase of bacterial multiplication was recorded (Fig. 1B). Taken together, the results suggest that the contact and complement systems both interfere with S. pyogenes growth in human blood. Following assembly of the contact factors on the bacterial surface, activation of the contact system results in the generation of antibacterial peptides derived from the D3 domain of HK (9Frick I.M. Åkesson P. Herwald H. Mörgelin M. Malmsten M. Nägler D.K. Björck L. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5569-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). SIC is secreted by some S. pyogenes strains, including all isolates of the M1 serotype, and an interaction between SIC and HK mediated through domains D3 and D5 was demonstrated recently (40Åkesson P. Herwald H. Rasmussen M. Håkansson K. Abrahamson M. Hasan A.A.K. Schmaier A. Müller-Esterl W. Björck L. Microbiology. 2010; (August 12, doi:10.1099/mic.0.039578-0)PubMed Google Scholar). Here, synthetic peptides spanning the D3 domain (Fig. 2A) were analyzed by indirect ELISA for binding to SIC. As shown in Fig. 2B, a strong binding was obtained with the NAT26 peptide. Furthermore, peptide LDC27 in the COOH terminus of D3 interacted with SIC, whereas the other peptides showed no affinity (Fig. 2B). The results were in full agreement with experiments where the peptides were applied to PVDF filters and probed with 125I-SIC (Fig. 2C). A homology model of the cystatin-like D3 domain of HK was generated by aligning amino acids 261–370 of HK with human cystatin F (E-value 4.33 × 10−10) (36Schüttelkopf A.W. Hamilton G. Watts C. van Aalten D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 16570-16575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The Swiss-model automated homology modeling server (37Schwede T. Kopp J. Guex N. Peitsch M.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3381-3385Crossref PubMed Scopus (4531) Google Scholar) revealed a typical cystatin-like structure with one α-helix and four antiparallel β-strands (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, the SIC-binding peptides NAT26 (red) and LDC27 (green) are predicted to be located in two separate intersecting antiparallel β-strands forming surface-exposed epitopes within the D3 domain (Fig. 2D). Intact domain D3 is antibacterial, and this activity is mainly located in the NAT26 sequence (9Frick I.M. Åkesson P. Herwald H. Mörgelin M. Malmsten M. Nägler D.K. Björck L. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5569-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). When tested at concentrations of 12–13 μm, the peptide LDC27 reduced the bacterial number with ∼8% as compared with a 100% cfu reduction obtained with the peptide NAT26 (9Frick I.M. Åkesson P. Herwald H. Mörgelin M. Malmsten M. Nägler D.K. Björck L. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5569-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), suggesting that the antibacterial activity of the NAT26 peptide could be blocked by SIC. Indeed, at a bactericidal concentration of NAT26 (0.642 μm), SIC blocked the killing of AP1 bacteria. In these experiments, the inhibitory effect of SIC on the classical antibacterial peptide LL-37 (0.446 μm) was included as a positive control (Fig. 2E). Fragments of domain D5 of HK, including the sequence HKH20, are also antibacterial (41Nordahl E.A. Rydengård V. Mörgelin M. Schmidtchen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34832-34839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Such fragments are, however, not generated as a result of contact activation (9Frick I.M. Åkesson P. Herwald H. Mörgelin M. Malmsten M. Nägler D.K. Björck L. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 5569-5578Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), but at the site of infection, they are produced through proteolytic cleavage of HK by enzymes released by activated neutrophils (41Nordahl E.A. Rydengård V. Mörgelin M. Schmidtchen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34832-34839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Also, the antibacterial activity of HKH20 against AP1 was blocked by SIC (data not shown). Complement activation leads to cleavage of C3 and generation of the inflammatory mediator C3a. Previous studies have demonstrated that this peptide is capable of killing various microorganisms (6Nordahl E.A. Rydengård V. Nyberg P. Nitsche D.P. Mörgelin M. Malmsten M. Björck L. Schmidtchen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2004; 101: 16879-16884Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 7Pasupuleti M. Walse B. Nordahl E.A. Mörgelin M. Malmsten M. Schmidtchen A. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 2520-2528Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 8Sonesson A. Ringstad L. Nordahl E.A. Malmsten M. Mörgelin M. Schmidtchen A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1768: 346-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Here, C3a also was found to kill AP1 bacteria (Fig. 3A), and at an antibacterial concentration of the peptide (0.22 μm), SIC inhibited this activity and promoted bacterial growth (Fig. 3B). However, higher molar concentrations of SIC were required to efficiently block C3a activity as compared with peptides NAT26 and LL-37. Whereas SIC at a concentration of 60 nm inhibited the activity of these peptides to 80–90% (Fig. 2E), C3a still killed ∼60% of the bacteria (Fig. 3B). The activation of the contact system at bacterial surfaces requires initial binding of the contact factors. HK has been demonstrated to bind to the surface of S. pyogenes (42Ben Nasr A.B. Herwald H. Müller-Esterl W. Björck L. Biochem. J. 1995; 305: 173-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and therefore, we tested whether SIC could interfere with this binding. Binding of radiolabeled HK to AP1 bacteria (Fig. 4A) was efficiently blocked by SIC (Fig. 4B), indicating that SIC not only blocks the action of antibacterial peptides generated through contact activation but also interferes with the activation process itself. We therefore investigated whether SIC influences bacterial growth in human plasma, and exogenously added SIC was found to enhance the multiplication of AP1 bacteria (Fig. 5A). This finding suggests that antibacterial HK fragments are bound and inactivated by SIC, and/or that SIC blocks binding of HK to the bacterial surface and thereby reduces the generation of antibacterial D3 fragments.FIGURE 5SIC protects S. pyogenes bacteria from killing in plasma. A, AP1 bacteria were cultivated in human citrated plasma with various concentrations of SIC: plasma alone (●), plasma+SIC 7.65 μm (□), plasma+SIC 15.3 μm (△), and plasma+SIC 23 μm (○). At indicated time points, bacteria were plated on TH agar plates. Plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C, the number of cfu was determined, and the MF was calculated by dividing the number of cfu at each time point with the number of cfu at time 0. The bars in the inset represent the mean values ± S.E. of at least three experiments following 8 h of growth. B, AP1 bacteria (8 × 107 cfu) were incubated with human citrated plasma at 37 °C for 1 h ± SIC. Bacteria were washed with PBS, and the binding of HK or HK fragments was analyzed by flow cytometry.

Because no information was available on transcriptional mechanisms that regulate PS biosynthesis in mammalian cells, we investigated the regulation of expression of the mouse PS synthase-1 (Pss1) gene. The Pss1 core promoter was characterized in vitro and in vivo through gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. Transcription factor-binding sites, such as a GC-box cluster that binds Sp1/Sp3/Sp4 and N-Myc, and a degenerate E-box motif that interacts with Tal1 and E47, were identified. Pss1 transactivation was higher in brain of neonatal mice than in other tissues, consistent with brain being a major site of expression of Pss1 mRNA and PSS1 activity. Enzymatic assays revealed that PSS1 activity is enriched in primary cortical astrocytes compared with primary cortical neurons. Site-directed mutagenesis of binding sites within the Pss1 promoter demonstrated that Sp and N-Myc synergistically activate Pss1 expression in astrocytes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation indicated that Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4 interact with a common DNA binding site on the promoter.

Phosphatidylserine (PS) 2The abbreviations used are: PS, phosphatidylserine; bHLH, basic helix loop helix; PSS, phosphatidylserine synthase; DsiRNA, dicer-substrate siRNA. is an anionic phospholipid that accounts for 5–11% of phospholipids in mammalian cells (reviewed in Ref. 1Vance J.E. Steenbergen R. Prog. Lipid Res. 2005; 44: 207-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). PS contributes to the physical properties of membranes and activates signaling enzymes such as protein kinase C (2Nishizuka Y. Science. 1992; 258: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (4230) Google Scholar), diacylglycerol kinase (3Abe T. Lu X. Jiang Y. Boccone C.E. Qian S. Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Walsh J.P. Biochem.

PS also modulates the binding of some ligands to their receptors (6Gagné J. Giguère C. Tocco G. Ohayon M. Thompson R.F. Baudry M. Massicotte G. Brain Res. 1996; 740: 337-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), and intriguingly, the anionic nature of PS targets positively charged proteins to endocytic/phagosomal membranes (7Yeung T.

In the plasma membrane of mammalian cells PS is normally highly enriched in the cytosolic leaflet but becomes exposed on the cell surface during several crucial physiological processes such as initiation of the blood-clotting cascade (reviewed in Ref. 8Zwaal R.F.

Immunol. 1992; 148: 2207-2216PubMed Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, PS is synthesized by a calcium-dependent base-exchange reaction in which the head group of an existing phospholipid is exchanged for l-serine (11Hübscher H.G. Dils R.R. Pover W.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1959; 36: 518-528Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Mammalian cells contain two distinct serine exchange enzymes: PS synthase-1 (PSS1) uses phosphatidylcholine, whereas PS synthase-2 (PSS2) uses phosphatidylethanolamine (12Kuge O. Nishijima M. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24184-24189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PSS1 and PSS2 are largely absent from the bulk of endoplasmic reticulum membranes but are highly enriched in mitochondria-associated membranes (13Stone S.J. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34534-34540Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), a specialized endoplasmic reticulum domain that facilitates PS import into mitochondria for decarboxylation to phosphatidylethanolamine (14Vance J.E.

The importance of PS decarboxylation is underscored by the finding that elimination of PS decarboxylation in mice causes mitochondrial defects and embryonic lethality (15Steenbergen R. Nanowski T.S.

However, strict conservation of the two Pss genes in mammalian cells implies strong evolutionary pressure. The relative abundance of PSS1 and PSS2 isoforms varies among tissues (16Bergo M.O.

Chem. 2008; 283: 12888-12897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19Sturbois-Balcerzak B. Stone S.J. Sreenivas A. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8205-8212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) consistent with the high PS content of this tissue (17Steenbergen R. Nanowski T.S. Nelson R. Young S.G. Vance J.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2006; 1761: 313-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). PS represents 11.1 and 7.2% of total phospholipids in rabbit cortical glial cells and neurons, respectively (21Goracci G. Francescangeli E. Mozzi R. Woelk H. Porcellati G. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1976; 72: 123-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). PS appears to be important for functioning of the brain and the visual system (reviewed in Ref. 22Salem Jr., N. Litman B. Kim H.Y. Gawrisch K. Lipids. 2001; 36: 945-959Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar). Despite the involvement of PS in many fundamental physiological processes, the mechanisms that regulate the synthesis and degradation of PS in mammalian cells are largely unknown. Early experiments indicated that PS synthesis in brain is regulated by protein kinase C-mediated phosphorylation (23Kanfer J.N. McCartney D. Hattori H. FEBS Lett. 1988; 240: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). PS synthesis is also regulated by a feedback mechanism in which PS synthesis declines when PS levels increase (24Nishijima M. Kuge O. Akamatsu Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 5784-5789Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Kuge O. Hasegawa K. Saito K. Nishijima M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1998; 95: 4199-4203Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Overexpression of PSS2 activity in hepatoma cells failed to stimulate PS biosynthesis (26Stone S.J. Vance J.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whereas overexpression of PSS1 activity increased the rate of PS biosynthesis (27Stone S.J. Cui Z. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7293-7302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), suggesting that PSS1 is rate-limiting for PS synthesis. Thus, enhanced expression of PSS1 might stimulate PS synthesis in a physiological context. Because no information was available on how expression of either PSS is regulated we investigated the mechanisms by which the Pss1 gene is regulated at the transcriptional level. We show that Pss1 transcription is enhanced in neonatal brain relative to other tissues. Moreover, Pss1 expression and PSS1 activity are higher in astrocytes than in neurons. We also demonstrate in vitro and in intact astrocytes that N-Myc, Sp1, Sp3, Sp4, and Tal1/E47 interact with, and cooperatively transactivate, the murine Pss1 promoter. Moreover, impaired interaction of Sp with the promoter, or reduced levels of Sp1, Sp3, or N-Myc, significantly attenuate Pss1 promoter activity and decrease PSS1 enzymatic activity. C3H10T1/2 cells were obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture Collection (Rockville, MD). Tissues were obtained from C57BL/6J mice. Glial cells and neurons were isolated from Sprague-Dawley rats and BALB/c mice. Fetal bovine serum (FBS) and tissue culture medium were from Invitrogen. The luciferase vector, pGL3-Basic (containing cDNA encoding Photinus pyralis), the pSV-β-galactosidase vector, the dual luciferase reporter assay system, and the β-galactosidase assay system were from Promega (Madison, WI). All DNA-modifying enzymes were from Invitrogen. Mithramycin A was from Sigma. [3-3H]Serine was from Amersham Biosciences. The following rabbit polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA): anti-Sp1 (sc-14027), anti-Sp3 (sc-644), anti-Sp4 (sc-13019), anti-E47 (sc-763), anti-Tal1 (sc-22809), and anti-C-Myc (sc-764). The mouse monoclonal anti-N-Myc antibody (NMYC1) was from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO). Rabbit anti-YY1 was from Active Motif (Carlsbad, CA). C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% FBS. Cortical glia were isolated from 1-day-old rats or mice (28Gong J.S. Kobayashi M. Hayashi H.

Chem. 2002; 277: 29919-29926Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) and cultured in 75-cm2 flasks (Falcon, BD Biosciences) in DMEM containing 10% FBS. Medium was changed every 3–4 days. After 7–10 days, cells were harvested by treatment with 0.125% trypsin and then replated in DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS. The glial cultures were highly enriched (>90%) in astrocytes (29Hayashi H. Campenot R.B. Vance D.E. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14009-14015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Microglia were isolated from mouse cortical glial cultures by mild trypsinization (30Saura J. Tusell J.M. Serratosa J. Glia. 2003; 44: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). Cortical neurons from 1-day-old rats were plated (5 × 104 cells/cm2) on dishes coated with poly-d-lysine (Sigma) in Neurobasal A medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with B27 (Invitrogen) and glutamine (Sigma) and used within 3–5 days (31Michikawa M. Gong J.S. Fan Q.W. Sawamura N. Yanagisawa K. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 7226-7235Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Pss1 promoter region −1408/+197 bp was isolated by PCR amplification using mouse liver genomic DNA as template and Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). Numbering is based on the transcriptional start site (+1) of the Pss1 gene (19Sturbois-Balcerzak B. Stone S.J. Sreenivas A. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8205-8212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Forward and reverse primers (supplemental Table S1) contained restriction sites for HindIII and SmaI, respectively. Amplified promoter fragments were subjected to restriction digestion with HindIII or SmaI (New England BioLabs), purified from agarose gels using the Qiaex II gel extraction kit (Qiagen Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada), then directionally ligated into double-digested (HindIII and SmaI) pGL3-Basic plasmid to generate luciferase constructs. Site-directed mutagenesis (supplemental Table S2) was performed using the −398 luciferase plasmid and the QuikChange® mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Identity of generated plasmids was confirmed by sequencing. C3H10T1/2 cells (2 × 105 cells/12-well plate) and primary astrocytes (8 × 105 cells/6-well plate) were transiently transfected with luciferase-reporter constructs (0.4 μg/cm2) and 0.1 μg/cm2 of pSV-β-galactosidase cDNA using LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen), then incubated with DNA-Lipofectamine in Opti-MEMI medium without serum for 6 h (for C3H10T1/2 cells) or 90 min (for astrocytes). Unincorporated complexes were removed and cells were incubated in growth medium. After 42–48 h luciferase activity was measured in cell lysates and normalized to β-galactosidase activity for transfection efficiency. Nuclear extracts were isolated from cells (32Andrews N.C. Faller D.V. Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 2499Crossref PubMed Scopus (2211) Google Scholar) and mouse tissues (33Deryckere F. Gannon F. BioTechniques. 1994; 16: 405PubMed Google Scholar). Promoter-derived overlapping oligonucleotides (50–65 bp) were synthesized by the University of Alberta DNA Core Facility. Complementary oligonucleotides (0.5 nmol) containing 5′ overhangs were heated at 70 °C for 10 min in 100 μl of annealing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm EDTA) then cooled to room temperature. Double-stranded oligonucleotides (10 pmol) were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP by filling end-recessed 3′-ends using Klenow fragment (Invitrogen). Complementary oligonucleotides corresponding to −308/−274- and −272/−251-bp promoter fragments were synthesized and annealed as above. Double-stranded oligonucleotides (5 pmol) were 5′-end labeled using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen) and [γ-32P]ATP. All labeled probes were purified on G-25 Sephadex Quick Spin columns (Roche Applied Science). For each EMSA, 2 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC), 20 μl of 2× binding buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol), 5–20 μg of nuclear proteins and labeled probe (100,000–150,000 cpm) were incubated (40 μl volume) for 30 min at room temperature. For competitive EMSAs, unlabeled double-stranded oligonucleotides (10–200-fold molar excess relative to probe) were incubated with nuclear extracts for 10 min at room temperature before addition of probe. The wild-type (WT) and mutated (m) and consensus (cs) oligonucleotides were: wtSp1 cs, 5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC-3′; mSp1 cs, 5′-ATTCGATCTCATGGGGGCGAGC-3′; wtMyc-Max cs, 5′-GGAAGCAGACCACGTGGTCTGCTTCC-3′; mMyc-Max cs, 5′-GGAAGCAGACCACGGAGTCTGCTTCC-3′; wtTal1 cs, 5′-ACCTGAACAGATGGTCGGCT-3′; mTal1 cs, 5′-ACCTGAACCGATTGTCGGCT-3′. For supershift assays, antibodies were added 15 min before the labeled probe and reactions were terminated with 8 μl of buffer (30% glycerol, 0.25% bromphenol blue, 0.25% xylene cyanol). Protein-DNA complexes were separated by 5 or 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in buffer containing 45 mm Tris, 45 mm borate, 1 mm EDTA (pH 8.3) at 4 °C and detected by autoradiography. Astrocyte growth medium was replaced with phosphate-buffered saline after which 1% formaldehyde was added for 10 min at room temperature followed by a 5-min incubation with 0.125 m glycine. Cross-linked products were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, then pelleted and resuspended in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8)) supplemented with protease inhibitors (complete Mini, Roche Applied Diagnostics) and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Samples were sonicated on ice (4–5 pulses for 30 s, 40% setting on Sonicator Ultrasonic Processor XL (Misonix Farmingdale, New York)), then lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were diluted 5-fold in buffer A (0.1% SDS, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8)) supplemented with protease inhibitors and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The products were used as input samples or aliquots were immunoprecipitated by incubation for 30 min at 4 °C with 2 μg of rabbit IgG (preimmune serum, sc-2027) or primary antibodies. Protein G-Sepharose 4B (Sigma) was incubated for at least 1 h at 4 °C with 1 mg/ml of bovine serum albumin (New England Biolabs) and 0.1 mg/ml of sonicated herring sperm DNA (Sigma), then washed with buffer A and resuspended in buffer A (1:1, v/v). Treated beads, 5 μg of herring sperm DNA, and 10 μg of bovine serum albumin were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C then washed 3 times with buffer A, 3 times with buffer A containing 1 m NaCl, 2 times with buffer containing 0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), and 2 times with 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) + 1 mm EDTA at room temperature for 5 min each. Immune complexes were eluted with 200 μl of 1.5% SDS, then with 150 μl of buffer containing 1% SDS and 0.1 m NaHCO3 for 15 min at room temperature. Eluted fractions were incubated overnight at 65 °C to reverse cross-links, then treated with 50 μg/ml of proteinase K for 1 h at 55 °C. DNA was recovered from complexes by phenol/chloroform extraction with 10 μg of glycogen as carrier. After ethanol precipitation, DNA was resuspended in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8) and 1 mm EDTA, then amplified by PCR using Platinum Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The following primers surrounding the Sp, Myc, and non-canonical E-box binding sites of the mouse Pss1 promoter were used: forward 5′-CCT GCT TCA CAG CGA CCG TGC-3′ and reverse 5′-TCC CCA CAT TAC GGC GGA GTG ACT-3′. A region containing exon 2 and intron 2 of the mouse phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (Pemt) gene was amplified with the following primers: forward, 5′-TTG CAG CTG ATC TCT TCG TT-3′; reverse, 5′-TGA CAG GCA TGG TGG GAA-3′ as negative control. Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol (Invitrogen), digested with amplification-grade RNase-free DNase, then RNA (2 μg) was reverse transcribed in a 20-μl volume containing oligo(dT) and Superscript II reverse transcriptase. Platinum SYBR Green qPCR Supermix-UDG (uracil-DNA glycosylase) was used to amplify genes in a Rotor-Gene RG-3000 thermocycler (Corbett Research, Mortlake, Australia). Each sample was analyzed in triplicate. Data from primary rat glial cells and neurons were analyzed using the standard curve method with normalization to cyclophilin A or β-actin. Primers for cyclophilin A were: forward, 5′-TCC AAA GAC AGC AGA AAA CTT TCG-3′; reverse, 5′-TCT TCT TGC TGG TCT TGC CAT TCC-3′. Primers for β-actin were: forward, 5′-ATG TTG CCC TAG ACT TCG AG-3′; reverse, 5′-GAT GCC ACA GGA TTC CAT AC-3′. Primers for rat Pss1 were: forward, 5′-CTT CCT CAT CAT CAG CGT GTT-3′; reverse, 5′-CTG CTT CTC TGG TGG CGT AT-3′. Primers for rat Pss2 were: forward, 5′-TAT CTG GTC CTT CTG CGT CTG-3′; reverse, 5′-TGA GTG TGT GCG GGT CAT AC-3′. For comparison of Pss1 transcript levels in mouse tissues, triplicate samples were analyzed by real time qPCR. Three reference genes (cyclophilin A, β-actin, hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase-1) were used for normalization using geNorm software. Primers for cyclophilin A and β-actin were as described above; primers used for mouse hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase-1 were: forward, 5′-GTT GGA TAT GCC CTT GAC TA-3′; reverse, 5′-GGC CAC AGG ACT AGA ACA C-3′. Primers for mouse Pss1 were: forward, 5′-GCC TTG TTG ATC CGT AGT TAT-3′; reverse, 5′-CTC CAG AAA CCG GCA AAC GAC-3′. Proteins were boiled at 90–100 °C for 5 min in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, and 5% β-mercaptoethanol, then electrophoresed on 10% polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% SDS and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were incubated with primary antibodies in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 100 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature, then peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (dilution 1:5,000, Pierce) were added for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoreactive proteins were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Pierce). Calnexin was detected with anti-calnexin antibodies (C5C9; Cell Signaling Technology (Pickering, ON)) as loading control. Astrocyte lysates were prepared by sonication in 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.25 m sucrose. Serine-exchange activity was measured (50–100 μg of protein) in the presence of 10 mm calcium chloride, 4 mm hydroxylamine, 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), and [3-3H]serine (50 μCi/μmol, 0.4 mm) (26Stone S.J. Vance J.E. Biochem. J. 1999; 342: 57-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The assay (200 μl) was performed for 20 min at 37 °C and terminated by addition of chloroform:methanol, 2:1 (v/v). The lower phase was washed 3 times with methanol:water (1:1, v/v) and radioactivity was measured. For competition assays, choline chloride (10 or 50 mm) was included. Dicer-substrate siRNAs (DsiRNAs) were from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). For targeting rat N-Myc, the pre-designed TriFECTa kit was used with 3 duplexes (antisense sequences for duplex 1, 5′-UUG AGG UAU UCU UAC AGU ACU UAG GUG-3′; duplex 2, 5′-AUU UAG UUA UGU AUC AGC AUC AUA CUA-3′; duplex 3, 5′-GUG GCA UUU GUG GAA CUU AAG CAC CAU-3′). For targeting rat Sp1, Sp3, and Sp4, two pairs of sense and antisense oligonucleotides/gene were designed using the Integrated DNA Technologies program. Oligonucleotides used for Sp1 were: antisense of duplex 1, 5′-AAA CAG AUU CCC UGG CUG AUG CUC CUA; antisense of duplex 2, 5′-UUC AUA AUU CCC AUG UUG CUG GUG GUG-3′; for Sp3, antisense of duplex 1, 5′-UCC CAU AGA CUU UAC CAC AUC CUG GUA-3′, antisense of duplex 2, 5′-GAU UGG UAC CUC UCC CAC CAC CUU CUU-3′; for Sp4, antisense of duplex 1, 5′-UUG UUG AAA CAU UGG GAG UUG CAG GAU-3′, antisense of duplex 2, 5′-UGG GCG UAG ACA CUA ACU GAU UUC CAU-3′. A scrambled oligonucleotide (5′-AUA CGC GUA UUA UAC GCG AUU AAC GAC-3′; DSscrambled Neg, Integrated DNA Technologies) that did not correspond to sequences in human, mouse, or rat genomes was used as negative control. Primary astrocytes were seeded at 40% confluence (8 × 105 cells/well in 6-well plate) and 24 h later transfected with 10 nm control or 10 nm/pool of specific DsiRNA using OligofectamineTM (Invitrogen) in Opti-MEM I medium. Pss1 mRNA expression was analyzed 3 days later. Protein content was determined by the BCA method (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Statistically significant differences between samples were assessed by the two-tailed Student's t test. p values of <0.05 were considered statistically significant. To define the functional promoter responsible for basal expression of the mouse Pss1 gene we cloned regions of the gene −1408/−99 bp upstream of the transcriptional initiation site into the promoterless pGL3-Basic plasmid vector upstream of the luciferase gene. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (C3H10T1/2 cells) were transfected with either control vector (pGL3-Basic) alone or with the vector containing promoter fragments. Luciferase activity was measured (Fig. 1). Promoter fragments between −1408, −1008, −808, −508, −398, and −309 bp at the 5′ position, and +197 bp at the fixed 3′-position (+110 bp relative to A in the initiation codon) had promoter activities 7–14-fold higher than control vector. However, deletion of 100 bp between −309/−208 bp essentially abolished promoter activity. Moreover, the −99/+197-bp fragment exhibited no detectable activity. Thus, the most active region of the promoter is −309/−208 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site. In an attempt to identify functional cis-elements involved in promotion of Pss1 gene expression, four overlapping oligonucleotides spanning the −356/−150-bp region of the promoter (−356/−302 bp, −308/−250 bp, −260/−198 bp, and −213/−150 bp) were used as probes in electromobility shift assays (EMSAs). A preliminary experiment indicated that all four oligonucleotides bound nuclear proteins from C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts (supplemental Fig. S1). The −308/−250-bp fragment exhibited by far the highest binding. To gain physiologically relevant information regarding Pss1 expression, nuclear proteins from mouse tissues that express high levels of Pss1 transcripts (i.e. brain, kidney, liver, and heart) (18Arikketh D. Nelson R. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2008; 283: 12888-12897Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19Sturbois-Balcerzak B. Stone S.J. Sreenivas A. Vance J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8205-8212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) were examined for interaction with the −356/−150-bp region of the promoter. Nuclear proteins from neonatal brain formed complexes with all four promoter fragments, whereas complexes formed with proteins from liver, heart, and kidney were far less abundant (Fig. 2A). Consistent with these observations, brain showed the highest Pss1 transcript levels among tissues of newborn mice (Fig. 2B). Thus, the Pss1 promoter region between −356/−150 bp contains DNA sequences that bind nuclear proteins, particularly those from neonatal brain. A computer-based transcription factor binding search program (TRANSFAC data base MatInspector) revealed that the −308/−250-bp region of the promoter contains a GC-box (putative Sp1-response element), an E-box (predicted binding motif for Myc/Hif), and a non-canonical E-box (predicted binding site for E protein and Tal1 transcription factors of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family; supplemental Fig. S2A). EMSAs with nuclear extracts from fibroblasts showed that the −308/−278-bp fragment interacted only with proteins of the Sp family of transcription factors (supplemental Fig. S2B). Mutation of either the Sp1 or non-canonical E-box elements reduced promoter activity by ∼60 and 45%, respectively (supplemental Fig. S2C) suggesting that both motifs transactivate the Pss1 promoter. Despite the in vitro binding of additional transcription factors, such as AP-2, AML-3, and IK-1, to the −260/−150-bp region according to EMSAs (data not shown), mutation of their corresponding binding sites did not significantly reduce promoter activity (supplemental Fig. S2C). We also used comparative sequence analysis to identify conserved regulatory elements within the Pss1 gene. Sequences upstream of the transcriptional start site of the mouse, human, and rat Pss1 genes were aligned and several highly conserved sequence blocks were identified in the −398/−208-bp region of the gene (Fig. 3). A conserved Sp1 binding sequence was located close to, and upstream of, a cluster of sites of high homology. Within this region we identified the canonical E-box motif (CACGTG) predicted to mediate interaction with Myc and Hif. Sequence analysis of the promoter also revealed that the highest sequence identities are in a cluster immediately upstream of the non-canonical E-box (CANNTG). This conserved cluster of putative binding sites suggests that the −309/−208-bp sequence is a functional promoter of the mouse Pss1 gene with evolutionarily conserved transcriptional regulatory elements. Compared with other tissues from newborn mice the brain showed the highest binding of nuclear proteins to this fragment (Fig. 2A). Thus, transcriptional regulation of Pss1 expres"

Richards and Cutkomp2, however, have found that choline esterase from insect nerves is more active on acetyl-ß-methylcholine than on acetylcholine.

Thus the whole animal of Patella vulgata, and the ampulla and podia of Asterias rubens from the west coast of Sweden, split acetyl-Î-methylcholine at a higher rate than acetylcholine.
