However, we report here that for the class of nanostructured gold- or platinum-cerium oxide catalysts, which are active for the water-gas shift reaction, metal nanoparticles do not participate in the reaction. Nonmetallic gold or platinum species strongly associated with surface cerium-oxygen groups are responsible for the activity."

Numerous x-ray studies, along with isolation and characterization of six proposed intermediates in the catalytic reaction under noncatalytic conditions, suggest that N 2 was reduced at a sterically protected, single molybdenum center that cycled from Mo(III) through Mo(VI) states."

https://openalex.org/W2076372398,"The complexity of cellular gene, protein, and metabolite networks can hinder attempts to elucidate their structure and function. To address this problem, we used systematic transcriptional perturbations to construct a first-order model of regulatory interactions in a nine-gene subnetwork of the SOS pathway in Escherichia coli. The model correctly identified the major regulatory genes and the transcriptional targets of mitomycin C activity in the subnetwork. This approach, which is experimentally and computationally scalable, provides a framework for elucidating the functional properties of genetic networks and identifying molecular targets of pharmacological compounds."

https://openalex.org/W2124772160,"Escherichia coli entry into the bladder is met with potent innate defenses, including neutrophil influx and epithelial exfoliation. Bacterial subversion of innate responses involves invasion into bladder superficial cells. We discovered that the intracellular bacteria matured into biofilms, creating pod-like bulges on the bladder surface. Pods contained bacteria encased in a polysaccharide-rich matrix surrounded by a protective shell of uroplakin. Within the biofilm, bacterial structures interacted extensively with the surrounding matrix, and biofilm associated factors had regional variation in expression. The discovery of intracellular biofilm-like pods explains how bladder infections can persist in the face of robust host defenses."

However, it is extremely difficult and costly to achieve with current technology, which requires catalytic reactors operated at high pressure and temperature. We show that Cu+ and Ag+ zeolite Y can adsorb sulfur compounds from commercial fuels selectively and with high sulfur capacities (by pi complexation) at ambient temperature and pressure. Thus, the sulfur content was reduced from 430 to <0.2 parts per million by weight in a commercial diesel at a sorbent capacity of 34 cubic centimeters of clean diesel produced per gram of sorbent. This sulfur selectivity and capacity are orders of magnitude higher than those obtained by previously known sorbents."

https://openalex.org/W2089866577,"It has been assumed that Nb and Ta are not fractionated during differentiation processes on terrestrial planets and that both elements are lithophile. High-precision measurements of Nb/Ta and Zr/Hf reveal that Nb is moderately siderophile at high pressures. Nb/Ta values in the bulk silicate Earth (14.0 +/- 0.3) and the Moon (17.0 +/- 0.8) are below the chondritic ratio of 19.9 +/- 0.6, in contrast to Mars and asteroids. The lunar Nb/Ta constrains the mass fraction of impactor material in the Moon to less than 65%. Moreover, the Moon-forming impact can be linked in time with the final core-mantle equilibration on Earth 4.533 billion years ago."
https://openalex.org/W1996172219,"Animal behavior is synchronized to the 24-hour light:dark (LD) cycle by regulatory programs that produce circadian fluctuations in gene expression throughout the body. In mammals, the transcription factor CLOCK controls circadian oscillation in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the brain; its paralog, neuronal PAS domain protein 2 (NPAS2), performs a similar function in other forebrain sites. To investigate the role of NPAS2 in behavioral manifestations of circadian rhythm, we studied locomotor activity, sleep patterns, and adaptability to both light- and restricted food-driven entrainment in NPAS2-deficient mice. Our results indicate that NPAS2 plays a substantive role in maintaining circadian behaviors in normal LD and feeding conditions and that NPAS2 is critical for adaptability to food restriction."
https://openalex.org/W2094931011,"Chemical weathering and the subsequent export of carbonate alkalinity (HCO 3 – + CO 3 – 2 ) from soils to rivers account for significant amounts of terrestrially sequestered atmospheric CO 2 . We show here that during the past half-century, the export of this alkalinity has increased dramatically from North America's largest river, the Mississippi. This increased export is in part the result of increased flow resulting from higher rainfall in the Mississippi basin. Subcatchment data from the Mississippi suggest that the increase in the export of alkalinity is also linked to amount and type of land cover. These observations have important implications for the potential management of carbon sequestration in the United States."
https://openalex.org/W1987821958,"Raf kinases have been linked to endothelial cell survival. Here, we show that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) differentially activate Raf, resulting in protection from distinct pathways of apoptosis in human endothelial cells and chick embryo vasculature. bFGF activated Raf-1 via p21-activated protein kinase-1 (PAK-1) phosphorylation of serines 338 and 339, resulting in Raf-1 mitochondrial translocation and endothelial cell protection from the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis, independent of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-1 (MEK1). In contrast, VEGF activated Raf-1 via Src kinase, leading to phosphorylation of tyrosines 340 and 341 and MEK1-dependent protection from extrinsic-mediated apoptosis. These findings implicate Raf-1 as a pivotal regulator of endothelial cell survival during angiogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2028335964,"The ability of sensitive rainforest species to evolve in response to climate change is largely unknown. We show that the Australian tropical rainforest fly Drosophila birchii exhibits clinal variation in desiccation resistance, but the most resistant population lacks the ability to evolve further resistance even after intense selection for over 30 generations. Parent-offspring comparisons indicate low heritable variation for this trait but high levels of genetic variation for morphology. D. birchii also exhibits abundant genetic variation at microsatellite loci. The low potential for resistance evolution highlights the importance of assessing evolutionary potential in targeted ecological traits and species from threatened habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2091172809,"The pharmacological basis of perceptual learning and associated cortical reorganizations remains elusive. We induced perceptual learning by Hebbian coactivation of the skin of the tip of the right index finger in humans. Under placebo, tactile two-point discrimination was improved on the coactivated but not on the left index finger. This augmentation was blocked by an N -methyl-D-aspartate–receptor blocker, but doubled by amphetamine. No drug effects were found on the left index finger. The individual amount of cortical reorganization as assessed by mapping of somatosensory evoked potentials was linearly correlated with the pharmacological modulation of discrimination thresholds, implying that perceptual learning and associated cortical changes are controlled by basic mechanisms known to mediate and modulate synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2108369371,"Understanding the formation of sulfate particles in the troposphere is critical because of their health effects and their direct and indirect effects on radiative forcing, and hence on climate. Laboratory studies of the chemical and physical changes in sodium chloride, the major component of sea-salt particles, show that sodium hydroxide is generated upon reaction of deliquesced sodium chloride particles with gas-phase hydroxide. The increase in alkalinity will lead to an increase in the uptake and oxidation of sulfur dioxide to sulfate in sea-salt particles. This chemistry is missing from current models but is consistent with a number of previously unexplained field study observations."
https://openalex.org/W1996788494,"Cytoplasmic (or non-muscle) myosin II isoforms are widely expressed molecular motors playing essential cellular roles in cytokinesis and cortical tension maintenance. Two of the three human non-muscle myosin II isoforms (IIA and IIB) have been investigated at the protein level. Transient kinetics of non-muscle myosin IIB showed that this motor has a very high actomyosin ADP affinity and slow ADP release. Here we report the kinetic characterization of the non-muscle myosin IIA isoform. Similar to non-muscle myosin IIB, non-muscle myosin IIA shows high ADP affinity and little enhancement of the ADP release rate by actin. The ADP release rate constant, however, is more than an order of magnitude higher than the steady-state ATPase rate. This implies that non-muscle myosin IIA spends only a small fraction of its ATPase cycle time in strongly actin-bound states, which is in contrast to non-muscle myosin IIB. Non-muscle myosin II isoforms thus appear to have distinct enzymatic properties that may be of importance in carrying out their cellular functions.

Non-muscle myosin II isoforms thus appear to have distinct enzymatic properties that may be of importance in carrying out their cellular functions. Myosin IIs are widespread molecular motors expressed in almost all eukaryotic cell types investigated (1Sellers J.R. Myosins. 2nd ed. Oxford University Press, New York1999Google Scholar). They share a common domain structure and subunit composition. All myosin II holoenzymes are hexameric with each of the two heavy chains binding an essential and a regulatory light chain. The N-terminal motor domain of the heavy chain contains the nucleotide and actin binding sites and confers ATPase activity. The light chains bind to the neck region. The C-terminal tail domain is responsible for heavy chain dimerization by forming an intermolecular coiled-coil structure. The motor and neck domains constitute the myosin “head” or subfragment-1 (S1). 1The abbreviations used are: S1, subfragment-1; mantADP, N-methylanthraniloyl-2′-deoxyadenosine 5′-diphosphate; mantATP, N-methylanthraniloyl-2′-deoxyadenosine 5′-triphosphate; MDCC-PBP, A197C point mutant bacterial phosphate binding protein labeled with N-[2-(1-maleimidyl)ethyl]-7-(diethylamino)coumarin-3-carboxamide; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; NM, non-muscle.1The abbreviations used are: S1, subfragment-1; mantADP, N-methylanthraniloyl-2′-deoxyadenosine 5′-diphosphate; mantATP, N-methylanthraniloyl-2′-deoxyadenosine 5′-triphosphate; MDCC-PBP, A197C point mutant bacterial phosphate binding protein labeled with N-[2-(1-maleimidyl)ethyl]-7-(diethylamino)coumarin-3-carboxamide; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; NM, non-muscle. Some lower eukaryotes such as Dictyostelium or Acanthamoeba have a single myosin II gene, and thus they are suitable model organisms for genetic studies on the general cellular functions of myosin II (2De Lozanne A. Spudich J.A. Science. 1987; 236: 1086-1091Crossref PubMed Scopus (758) Google Scholar, 3Kong H.H. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 4993-5002Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In contrast, higher animals express a multitude of myosin IIs. Some of these myosin II isoforms are specific to skeletal, cardiac, or smooth muscle, whereas cytoplasmic or “non-muscle” myosin IIs show ubiquitous tissue distribution. Genomic analysis has revealed the existence of at least three different non-muscle (NM) myosin II isoforms in humans termed NMIIA, NMIIB, and NMIIC (4Berg J.S. Powell B.C. Cheney R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 780-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar), of which NMIIA and NMIIB have been investigated at the protein level (5Pato M.D. Sellers J.R. Preston Y.A. Harvey E.V.

Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 915-924Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), whereas some cell types are selectively enriched either in NMIIA (such as platelets, lymphocytes, neutrophil granulocytes, brush border cells, RBL2H3 cells) (10Maupin P. Phillips C.L. Adelstein R.S. Pollard T.D. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 3077-3090Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or in NMIIB (neuronal tissue) (11Rochlin M.W. Itoh K. Adelstein R.S. Bridgman P.C. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 3661-3670Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Little has been published on the localization of NMIIC because this isoform was only recently discovered upon completion of sequencing of the human genome (4Berg J.S. Powell B.C. Cheney R.E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 780-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (619) Google Scholar). Detailed transient kinetic studies on several muscle myosin isoforms have provided mechanistic insight into their cyclical interaction with actin and nucleotide that underlies muscle contraction (12Bagshaw C.R. Trentham D.R. Biochem. J. 1974; 141: 331-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar, 13Cremo C.R. Geeves M.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 1969-1978Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 14Lymn R.W. Taylor E.W.

Upon ATP binding, the myosin head rapidly detaches from actin and then hydrolyzes ATP. Rebinding to actin is thought to occur in a “primed” conformation of the head with the hydrolysis products at the active site. The subsequent “powerstroke” of the chemomechanical cycle is coupled to product release. A recent study of the NMIIB isoform showed that, although this myosin uses the same general ATPase mechanism, the unusually low ratio (about 3) of the ADP and phosphate release rate constants and the positive thermodynamic coupling between actin and ADP binding make its working cycle more suited for sustained maintenance of tension, as opposed to short duration force generation that occurs with muscle myosins (8Wang F. Kovács M. Hu A. Limouze J. Harvey E.V. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27439-27448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Therefore, in the light of the partially overlapping localization and the possibility of cofilament formation by the NMIIA and NMIIB isozymes, it is of interest to determine whether NMIIA shares these enzymatic properties. To this end, we performed a transient kinetic characterization of a recombinant NMIIA S1 fragment expressed in the baculovirus/Sf9 cell system. We find that NMIIA S1 exhibits slow kinetics and a high ADP affinity of the actoS1 complex, similarly to NMIIB and smooth muscle myosin. The rate constant of ADP release from actomyosin, however, is about 13 times greater than that of phosphate release. This behavior results in a low duty ratio, which means that only a small fraction of the myosin heads is in strongly actin-bound states at any time during steady-state ATP hydrolysis. NMIIA is therefore similar to smooth and skeletal muscle myosins in this respect, unlike NMIIB, which has an intermediate duty ratio (8Wang F. Kovács M. Hu A. Limouze J. Harvey E.V. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27439-27448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 17Harris D.E. Warshaw D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14764-14768Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the two cytoplasmic myosins characterized to date show similar but distinct enzymatic properties. Cloning, Expression, and Protein Purification—The DNA construct containing the full-length human NMIIA cDNA (MYH9, GenBank accession number M81105) cloned into pBluescript (Stratagene) was created as described previously (7Wang F. Harvey E.V. Conti M.A. Wei D. Sellers J.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5555-5560Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 18Wei Q. Adelstein R.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 3617-3627Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). This plasmid was used as a PCR template to amplify a DNA fragment spanning from the unique SfiI site within the S1 coding region to the 3′-end of NMIIA S1 (amino acid 836) followed by a FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) coding sequence, a stop codon, and an XbaI site. An NMIIA S1 cDNA construct with a C-terminal FLAG tag was created by exchanging this PCR fragment with an SfiI-XbaI cassette of the full-length NMIIA cDNA plasmid. The NMIIA S1 cDNA was then subcloned into the baculovirus transfer vector pVL1392 (Invitrogen) between the EagI and XbaI sites. The nucleotide sequence of the resulting vector was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The NMIIA S1 heavy chain was coexpressed with essential (bovine non-muscle MLC17B) and regulatory (chicken non-muscle MLC20) light chains (5Pato M.D. Sellers J.R. Preston Y.A. Harvey E.V. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2689-2695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Recombinant baculoviruses were generated, and the expressed protein was purified as described earlier (7Wang F. Harvey E.V. Conti M.A. Wei D. Sellers J.R. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 5555-5560Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Actin was prepared from rabbit skeletal muscle according to the method of Spudich and Watt (19Spudich J.A. Watt S. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 4866-4871Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Labeling of actin with pyrene-iodoacetamide was performed as in Ref. 20Cooper J.A. Walker S.B. Pollard T.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar. Mant nucleotides were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Other reagents were from Sigma. Kinetic Experiments—Steady-state ATPase activity was measured using an NADH-coupled assay at 25 °C as described previously (8Wang F. Kovács M. Hu A. Limouze J. Harvey E.V. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27439-27448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) in the presence of 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.15 mm EGTA, and 1 mm ATP. All experiments were performed on unphosphorylated NMIIA S1 because phosphorylation does not affect the steady-state ATPase activity of single-headed smooth muscle and non-muscle myosin constructs (21Cremo C.R.

Onishi H. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2001; : 365-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Unless stated otherwise, all stopped flow experiments were carried out in an SF-2001 stopped flow apparatus (KinTek Corp., Austin, TX) at 25 °C in 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 5 mm MgCl2, 100 mm KCl, and 0.1 mm EGTA (for more detailed experimental conditions, see Ref. 8Wang F.

Phosphate release experiments were performed in 10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 2 mm MgCl2, and 0.15 mm EGTA in the SF-2001 instrument essentially as described previously (8Wang F. Kovács M. Hu A. Limouze J.

Chem. 2003; 278: 27439-27448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) except that two 1-ml syringes were used for the first mix (1:1 volume ratio), which was subsequently pushed alongside a 5-ml syringe containing the third component (1:2.5 mixing ratio), allowing for lower concentrations of actin to be used in the syringe. The performance of the instrument in the double-mixing setup was tested using the reaction of N-acetyl-l-tryptophanamide with N-bromosuccinimide as well as the binding of inorganic phosphate to MDCC-PBP with the latter having a second order rate constant of about 50 μm–1 s–1 under our experimental conditions. Quenched flow experiments were done as described earlier (8Wang F. Kovács M. Hu A. Limouze J. Harvey E.V. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27439-27448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) at 25 °C in 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.1 mm EGTA. Data Analysis and Modeling—Concentrations stated in the description of rapid mixing experiments refer to concentrations after mixing unless otherwise indicated. In stopped flow measurements of actin and ADP affinity, equilibrium concentrations before mixing are relevant in terms of analyzing amplitudes, whereas the rate parameters are interpreted on the basis of concentrations after mixing. Figures and figure legends reflect the actual relevant conditions. Fitting of the experimental data to mathematical functions was done using SigmaPlot 2001 and Origin 5.0 (Microcal Software). In quadratic fits of equilibrium titration curves, constant concentration of the titrated species (i.e. pyrene-actin in our experiments) was treated as a floating parameter (just as the maximum amplitude of the signal change) to avoid artifacts arising from uncertainties in concentration determinations and stoichiometry of the components at saturation. Reported standard errors of the mean are those of three separate rounds of experiment, except in some cases (as indicated) where they represent the fitting error of a single data set. Kinetic simulations were performed using Gepasi version 3.21 (©Pedro Mendes, Virginia Bioinformatics Institute). Protein Design, Expression, and Steady-state ATPase Activity—We expressed a recombinant construct comprising the first 836 amino acids of the NMIIA heavy chain resembling the proteolytic S1 of skeletal muscle myosin. This soluble fragment retains the enzymatic properties of full-length myosin. The heavy chain fragment was coexpressed with recombinant 17-kDa (essential) and 20-kDa (regulatory) light chains (5Pato M.D. Sellers J.R. Preston Y.A. Harvey E.V. Adelstein R.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2689-2695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) in the baculovirus/Sf9 expression system. Typically, at least 5 mg of recombinant protein could be prepared from 2 × 109 cells. We measured the basal and actin-activated MgATPase activity of NMIIA S1 using a NADH-coupled assay at 25 °Cinlow ionic strength conditions (10 mm MOPS (pH 7.0), 2 mm MgCl2, 0.15 mm EGTA, 1 mm ATP).

For practical reasons, we used the same kinetic scheme as was used for NMIIB S1 (8Wang F. Kovács M. Hu A. Limouze J. Harvey E.V. Sellers J.R. J. Biol.

The upper line shows the actin-associated pathway of ATP binding, hydrolysis, and product release (AM, actomyosin). The lower line represents the corresponding steps when myosin (M) is dissociated from actin (A). The bold symbols show the main flux pathway of the reaction. Equilibrium constants throughout this paper are expressed as viewed processing to the right on Scheme 1, and those between actin-associated and dissociated states going in the dissociation direction. Rate constants have positive indices in these directions. ATP binding was modeled as a two-step reaction consisting of a second order collision step (K 1 or K 1′) and a subsequent isomerization (K 2 or K 2′) which becomes rate-limiting at high ATP concentrations. Although ADP binding (and dissociation) has been shown to consist of similar events (25Bagshaw C.R. Eccleston J.F. Eckstein F. Goody R.S. Gutfreund H. Trentham D.R. Biochem. J. 1974; 141: 351-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar), we consider it as a single step (K 5 or K 5′) for simplicity because the substeps were not resolved in the experiments reported herein. The same holds for the ATP hydrolysis step (K 3 or K 3′) which has been kinetically resolved to a conformational change and the actual chemical step (26Malnasi-Csizmadia A. Pearson D.S. Kovács M. Woolley R.J. Geeves M.A. Bagshaw C.R. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 12727-12737Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), with phosphate release (K 4 or K 4′) probably being similar to it in this respect. ATP Binding and Actomyosin Dissociation—The fluorescent nucleotide, mantATP, shows a fluorescence enhancement on binding to myosin S1. When mixed in the stopped flow apparatus under pseudo-first order conditions (0.1 μm NMIIA S1 and 1–15 μm mantATP), the obtained traces could be fitted to single exponentials. The dependence of the observed rate constant (k obs) on mantATP concentration was linear and gave an apparent second order rate constant (K 1 k 2) of 1.03 ± 0.14 μm–1 s–1 (Fig. 2A and Table I). The binding rate constant of mantATP to actoNMIIA S1 (K1′k 2′) appeared to be much slower (0.14 ± 0.003 μm–1 s–1, Fig. 2A), which is in contrast to various muscle myosin isoforms (Table I). ATP causes dissociation of the complex of NMIIA S1 with pyrene-labeled actin that was accompanied by an increase in pyrene fluorescence. The time course was a single exponential, and the observed rate constant depended hyperbolically on ATP concentration with half-saturation around 900 μm ATP (Fig. 2B). The maximal value of the observed rate constant of dissociation was around 190 s–1, showing that the isomerization step leading to actomyosin dissociation is much slower in NMIIA than other myosins investigated to date except for NMIIB (Table I). A linear fit to the data points at low [ATP] yielded a value of 0.21 ± 0.04 μm–1 s–1, which is similar to the K 1′k 2′ value measured with mantATP binding. ATP Hydrolysis—Upon mixing with ATP in the stopped flow apparatus, an ∼5% increase in NMIIA tryptophan fluorescence was detected (Fig. 3A). The fluorescence change was monophasic and yielded an apparent second order rate constant (K 1 k 2)of 0.56 ± 0.01 μm–1 s–1 at low [ATP], a value about one-half of that seen with mantATP binding (Table I). The k obs showed saturation at 14.1 ± 0.5 s–1 (Fig. 3B), indicating that it is limited by the apparent rate of ATP hydrolysis (k 3 + k –3). This assumption was confirmed by quenched flow experiments directly monitoring the breakdown of ATP into products. At 50 μm ATP, a single exponential burst with a k obs of 18.1 ± 2.0 s–1 (k 3 + k –3) was followed by a linear steady-state phase of ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 3C). The calculated steady-state ATPase rate was 0.014 s–1, in good agreement with the results of the NADH-coupled assay (see above). In the presence of 20 μm actin, the k obs of the burst phase was slowed down to around 13 s–1 at 50 μm ATP (data not shown), consistent with the slow ATP binding rate constant of actoNMIIA S1 (see above), indicating that nucleotide binding is still rate-limiting in these conditions. The rate of the steady-state phase was increased to about 0.05 s–1 by 20 μm actin. The amplitude of the burst phase in the quenched flow experiments was unusually low (values between 0.3 and 0.4 mol of Pi/mol of NMIIA S1 were obtained, regardless of the presence of actin), similarly to earlier observations on human NMIIB (8Wang F. Kovács M. Hu A. Limouze J. Harvey E.V. Sellers J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 27439-27448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Because these values are affected by the accuracy of protein concentration measurements and the proportion of nonfunctional protein in the preparation, we carried out single turnover quenched flow experiments to obtain an independent measure of the burst amplitude (Fig. 3D). These measurements confirmed the burst amplitude stated above, indicating that the equilibrium constant of the ATP hydrolysis step on the enzyme (K 3) is as low as 0.61 ± 0.07 (K 3 = A/(1 – A), where A is the burst amplitude expressed as n(Pi burst)/n(S1total) in the multiple turnover experiment, and n(Pi burst)/n(ATPtotal) in single turnover conditions). From the hydrolysis equilibrium constant and the rate constant of the burst at 50 μm ATP, a k 3 value of 7 ± 2 s–1 and a k –3 of 11 ± 3 s–1 could be calculated (Table I). Phosphate Release—The kinetics of phosphate release from NMIIA S1 and actoNMIIA S1 was followed using a fluorescently labeled bacterial phosphate binding protein (MDCC-PBP) (27Brune M. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8262-8271Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). Mixing NMIIA S1 with ATP under single turnover conditions (1.4 μm S1 and 1 μm ATP) resulted in an increase in MDCC-PBP fluorescence with a k obs (= k 4) of 0.016 ± 0.001 s–1, in good agreement with the results of the steady-state ATPase measurements (see above). Pi release from actoS1 was measured in the sequential mixing mode of the stopped flow apparatus. First, NMIIA S1 and ATP was mixed at a volume ratio of 1:1 to yield an S1 concentration of 1.4 μm and ATP concentration of 1 μm after mixing. This mixture was incubated for 5 s for ATP binding and hydrolysis to occur and then mixed rapidly with actin filaments while monitoring the change in MDCC-PBP fluorescence. Single exponential traces were observed throughout the actin concentration range studied (0–60 μm, Fig. 4, A and B). The observed phosphate release rate constants showed good agreement with the steady-state ATPase activities at the corresponding actin concentrations (Fig. 4B; cf. Fig. 1; note that Fig. 1 is corrected for basal ATPase activity of NMIIA S1, whereas Fig. 4B is n"

VDR is a nuclear receptor that functions as a ligand-activated transcription factor, whereas the hairless gene product (Hr) acts as a corepressor of both the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) and the orphan nuclear receptor, RORα. In the present study, we show that VDR-mediated transactivation is strikingly inhibited by coexpression of rat Hr. The repressive effect of Hr is observed on both synthetic and naturally occurring VDR-responsive promoters and also when VDR-mediated transactivation is augmented by overexpression of its heterodimeric partner, retinoid X receptor. Utilizing in vitro pull down methods, we find that Hr binds directly to VDR but insignificantly to nuclear receptors that are not functionally repressed by Hr. Coimmunoprecipitation data demonstrate that Hr and VDR associate in a cellular milieu, suggesting in vivo interaction. The Hr contact site in human VDR is localized to the central portion of the ligand binding domain, a known corepressor docking region in other nuclear receptors separate from the activation function-2 domain. Coimmunoprecipitation and functional studies of Hr deletants reveal that VDR contacts a C-terminal region of Hr that includes motifs required for TR and RORα binding. Finally, in situ hybridization analysis of hr and VDR mRNAs in mouse skin demonstrates colocalization in cells of the hair follicle, consistent with a hypothesized intracellular interaction between these proteins to repress VDR target gene expression, in vivo.

Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 156-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar) have revealed multiple biological consequences of VDR signaling. VDR is required primarily for the following: (i) stimulation of calcium and phosphate absorption from the intestine to prevent rickets, (ii) induction of the CYP24 enzyme that initiates the catabolism of 1,25(OH)2D3, and (iii) progression of the normal hair cycle in mammalian skin. Although VDR gene ablation in mice elicits both rickets and hair loss (13Yoshizawa T. Handa Y. Uematsu Y. Takeda S. Sekine K. Yoshihara Y. Kawakami T. Arioka K. Sato H. Uchiyama Y. Masushige S.

Interaction of VDR with its heterodimeric partner RXR is likely relevant to hair cycling, as the conditional inactivation of RXRα in mouse skin (22Li M. Indra A.K. Warot X. Brocard J. Messaddeq N.

Like mutations in the gene encoding VDR, mutations in the mammalian hairless (hr) gene result in congenital hair loss in both mice (23Stoye J.P. Fenner S. Greenoak G.E. Moran C. Coffin J.M.

Genet. 1998; 7: 1671-1679Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Remarkably, the hair loss phenotype caused by specific mutations in the human VDR gene resembles the generalized atrichia caused by mutations in the hr gene (26Miller J. Djabali K. Chen T. Liu Y. Ioffreda M. Lyle S. Christiano A.M. Holick M. Cotsarelis G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 117: 612-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The shared hair loss phenotype of hr and VDR mutant animals and humans suggests that both proteins impact a common signaling pathway. In addition to genetic evidence of a potential relationship between hr and VDR, the function of the hr gene product (Hr) may be relevant to VDR signaling as well. Hr is a nuclear protein with a molecular mass of 130 kDa that is expressed primarily in skin and brain (27Cachon-Gonzalez M.B. Fenner S. Coffin J.M. Moran C. Best S. Stoye J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7717-7721Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 28Thompson C.C. J. Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7832-7840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Potter G.B. Zarach J.M. Sisk J.M. Thompson C.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2547-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) and was shown recently (30Potter G.B. Beaudoin III, G.M. DeRenzo C.L. Zarach J.M. Chen S.H. Thompson C.C. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2687-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar) to function as a potent nuclear receptor corepressor. Despite a lack of sequence identity with other corepressors (N-CoR and SMRT), Hr functions in a similar manner; Hr was shown to mediate repression via unliganded thyroid hormone receptor (TR), bind to TR through conserved hydrophobic motifs, and interact with histone deacetylases (29Potter G.B. Zarach J.M. Sisk J.M. Thompson C.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2547-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 30Potter G.B. Beaudoin III, G.M. DeRenzo C.L. Zarach J.M. Chen S.H. Thompson C.C. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 2687-2701Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Unlike N-CoR and SMRT, Hr interacts with TR but not retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and can also inhibit transcriptional activation by the RAR-related orphan receptor, ROR (31Moraitis A.N. Giguere V. Thompson C.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 6831-6841Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Based on genetic and biochemical evidence, we postulate that a network of interactions between Hr and VDR exists in the skin to drive the progression of the hair cycle. Because VDR and TR are similar in structure, we tested the hypothesis that Hr interacts with VDR as a corepressor. In the present report we show the following: (i) VDR interacts physically with Hr, (ii) this association dramatically represses VDR-mediated transactivation, and (iii) Hr and VDR are coexpressed in cells of the hair follicle. Our results are consistent with the presence of VDR and Hr in a signal transduction cascade in the hair follicle that represses gene expression, possibly silencing a gene that codes for an inhibitor of the hair cycle.

Transfection of COS Cells/Transcription Assays—African green monkey kidney cells (COS-1, COS-7) obtained from ATCC were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Omega Scientific, Tarzana, CA or Invitrogen). For transfections with HRE-hGH reporter plasmids, COS-7 cells were plated at 80,000 cells per well in a 24-well plate and transfected 6 h later with 250 ng of reporter plasmid, 250 ng of receptor expression plasmid(s), and either 250 ng of pRK5myc-rhr or pTZ18U carrier DNA.

After 36 h, cells were harvested in passive lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI), and extracts were assayed for β-galactosidase and luciferase activity. Luciferase activity was divided by β-galactosidase activity to normalize for transfection efficiency. Experiments were done in duplicate and repeated at least three times with similar results. For transfection assays with p24-OHaseLuc, COS-7 cells were transfected with 37.5 ng/well of p24-OHaseLuc, 0.1 ng/well of pRL-CMV (non-regulated Renilla luciferase control), 25 ng/well of pSG5hVDR, and where indicated, 10 ng/well of pRK5myc-rhr, either in the absence or presence of 10 nm 1,25(OH)2D3.

Neurosci. 1996; 16: 7832-7840Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) cDNAs were cloned into the EcoRI site of the GST fusion protein vector, pGEX-4T (Amersham Biosciences) to create GST-hVDR, GST-hRXRα, and GST-rHr (residues 31–1207). pGEX fusion constructs were transformed into Escherichia coli (strain BL21 for VDR and Hr; strain DH5α for RXRα).

GST alone was expressed from pGEX-4T in E. coli strain DH5α and linked to glutathione-Sepharose beads to serve as a control for background protein association. For GST pull down assays, expression plasmids (1.0 μg) were used to generate [35S]methionine-labeled proteins by in vitro transcription/translation (TNT Coupled Reticulocyte lysate kit, Promega, Madison, WI). GST-control, GST-hVDR, GST-hVDR-E420A, or GST-RXRα glutathione-Sepharose beads (25 μl each) were incubated in KETZD-0.15 m buffer (47Jurutka P.W. Remus L.S. Whitfield G.K. Thompson P.D. Hsieh J.-C.

When Hr beads were employed in pull down assays, the ligand (1,25(OH)2D3 (10-7m) or dexamethasone (10-6m)) was included in the in vitro transcription/translation reaction. The liganded, synthesized protein was then incubated with GST-Hr beads for 30 min at 4 °C as above. In all cases, beads were washed four times with KETZD-0.15 to remove unbound protein(s). The bound proteins were extracted from the beads into loading buffer (4% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 125 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 20% glycerol), boiled 3 min, and separated by gradient (5–20%) SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography.

In Situ Hybridization—For the hr-specific probe, a fragment corresponding to nucleotides 1004–3928 of the mouse hr cDNA (27Cachon-Gonzalez M.B. Fenner S. Coffin J.M. Moran C. Best S. Stoye J.P. Proc.

The VDR-specific probe corresponds to nucleotides 71–1371 of mouse VDR cDNA and was made using reverse transcription of mouse brain total RNA (Thermoscript RT-PCR System; Invitrogen) followed by PCR amplification with specific primers (5′-TCAGGAGATCTCATTGCCAAAC-3′ and 5′-CAGACCAGAGTTCTTTTGGTTG-3′). The mVDR cDNA was ligated into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) in both orientations, and the resulting plasmids were linearized with BamHI and used as templates to produce sense and antisense probes. Digoxigenin-labeled cRNA probes were made as described (29Potter G.B. Zarach J.M. Sisk J.M. Thompson C.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2547-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Serial sections (5 μm) of dorsal skin from postnatal day 15 mice were used for in situ hybridization. Sections were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and then acetylated/dehydrated in 0.25% acetic anhydride in 0.1 m triethanolamine. Sections were prehybridized with hybridization solution (5× Denhardt's solution, 12.5 mg of yeast tRNA, 5× SSC, 50% formamide) and then incubated with hybridization solution containing ∼200 ng of probe per slide in a humidified chamber overnight at 60 °C. The following day sections were washed at 60 °C with 5× SSC, followed by 2× SSC, 0.2× SSC/50% formamide, and 0.2× SSC. To detect the hybridized probe, sections were incubated with anti-digoxigenin-alkaline phosphatase Fab fragments (Roche Applied Science) diluted 1:5000 in Buffer 1 (0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 0.15 m NaCl). After washing, sections were incubated with color solution (0.34 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium, 0.175 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate, 4-toluidine salt, 0.24 mg/ml Levamisole in 0.1 m Tris-Cl, pH 9.5, 0.1 m NaCl, 0.005 m MgCl2) overnight in a humidified chamber. The sections were dehydrated and cleared overnight in Citrisolv (Fisher). Digital images of sections were obtained as described previously (29Potter G.B. Zarach J.M. Sisk J.M. Thompson C.C. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 16: 2547-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Hr Inhibits Transactivation by Liganded VDR—The potential effect of Hr on VDR activity was evaluated in a mammalian cell line (COS) that expresses low levels (≤500 copies/cell) of endogenous VDR. Cells were cotransfected with a hVDR expression plasmid and VDR-responsive reporter constructs, and 1,25(OH)2D3-induced transcriptional activity was measured in the absence and presence of cotransfected Hr. When the rat osteocalcin VDRE reporter construct was employed, as expected, the 1,25(OH)2D3 ligand markedly enhances transcription via VDR (Fig. 1A). Cotransfection of Hr results in a moderate decrease in basal transcription (40%) and a dramatic reduction in transcriptional activation by 1,25(OH)2D3-liganded VDR (∼7-fold). In addition, Hr sharply represses (11-fold) VDR-m"
https://openalex.org/W2015452592,"The nuclear receptors liver X receptor (LXR) alpha and LXRbeta serve as oxysterol receptors and regulate the expression of genes involved in lipid metabolism. LXR activation induces the expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, such as ABCG5 and ABCG8, which inhibit intestinal absorption of cholesterol and phytosterols. Although several synthetic LXR agonists have been generated, these compounds have limited clinical application, because they cause hypertriglycemia by inducing the expression of lipogenic genes in the liver. We synthesized derivatives of phytosterols and found some of them to act as LXR agonists. Among them, YT-32 [(22E)-ergost-22-ene-1alpha,3beta-diol], which is related to ergosterol and brassicasterol, is the most potent LXR agonist. YT-32 directly bound to LXRalpha and LXRbeta and induced the interaction of LXRalpha with cofactors, such as steroid receptor coactivator-1, as effectively as the natural ligands, 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol and 24(S),25-epoxycholesterol. Although the nonsteroidal synthetic LXR agonist T0901317 induced the expression of intestinal ABC transporters and liver lipogenic genes, oral administration of YT-32 selectively activated intestinal ABC transporters in mice. Unlike T0901317 treatment, YT-32 inhibited intestinal cholesterol absorption without increasing plasma triglyceride levels. The phytosterol-derived LXR agonist YT-32 might selectively modulate intestinal cholesterol metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2049656093,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) harbors a protein quality control system, which monitors protein folding in the ER. Elimination of malfolded proteins is an important function of this protein quality control. Earlier studies with various soluble and transmembrane ER-associated degradation (ERAD) substrates revealed differences in the ER degradation machinery used. To unravel the nature of these differences we generated two type I membrane ERAD substrates carrying malfolded carboxypeptidase yscY (CPY*) as the ER-luminal ERAD recognition motif. Whereas the first, CT* (CPY*-TM), has no cytoplasmic domain, the second, CTG*, has the green fluorescent protein present in the cytosol. Together with CPY*, these three substrates represent topologically diverse malfolded proteins, degraded via ERAD. Our data show that degradation of all three proteins is dependent on the ubiquitin-proteasome system involving the ubiquitin-protein ligase complex Der3/Hrd1p-Hrd3p, the ubiquitin conjugating enzymes Ubc1p and Ubc7p, as well as the AAA-ATPase complex Cdc48-Ufd1-Npl4 and the 26S proteasome. In contrast to soluble CPY*, degradation of the membrane proteins CT* and CTG* does not require the ER proteins Kar2p (BiP) and Der1p. Instead, CTG* degradation requires cytosolic Hsp70, Hsp40, and Hsp104p chaperones."

VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration is a key step in the angiogenic response and is mediated by an accelerated rate of focal adhesion complex assembly and disassembly. In this study, we identified the signaling mechanisms by which VEGF regulates human brain microvascular endothelial cell (HBMEC) integrity and assembly of focal adhesions, complexes comprised of scaffolding and signaling proteins organized by adhesion to the extracellular matrix. We found that VEGF treatment of HBMECs plated on laminin or fibronectin stimulated cytoskeletal organization and increased focal adhesion sites. Pretreating cells with VEGF antibodies or with the specific inhibitor SU-1498, which inhibits Flk-1/KDR receptor phosphorylation, blocked the ability of VEGF to stimulate focal adhesion assembly. VEGF induced the coupling of focal adhesion kinase (FAK) to integrin αvβ5 and tyrosine phosphorylation of the cytoskeletal components paxillin and p130 cas. Additionally, FAK and related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK)/Pyk2 kinases were tyrosine-phosphorylated by VEGF and found to be important for focal adhesion sites. Overexpression of wild type RAFTK/Pyk2 increased cell spreading and the migration of HBMECs, whereas overexpression of catalytically inactive mutant RAFTK/Pyk2 markedly suppressed HBMEC spreading (∼70%), adhesion (∼82%), and migration (∼65%). Furthermore, blocking of FAK by the dominant-interfering mutant FRNK (FAK-related non-kinase) significantly inhibited HBMEC spreading and migration and also disrupted focal adhesions. Thus, these studies define a mechanism for the regulatory role of VEGF in focal adhesion complex assembly in HBMECs via activation of FAK and RAFTK/Pyk2.

The microvasculature responds dynamically to the flow of substances, free radical exposure, and cytokine generation associated with focal ischemia.

Brain endothelial cells are linked to each other by gap, tight, and adherens-type junctions and are linked to the extracellular matrix by a variety of integrin and other adhesion molecules. VEGF activates endothelial cells, in part, by stimulating signal transduction pathways that regulate the enzymatic components of adhesion complexes. VEGF induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of vascular endothelial (VE) cadherins, molecules important in endothelial cell migration (15Esser S. Lampugnani M.G. Corada M. Dejana E. Risau W. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 1853-1865Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and also induced phosphorylation of the tight junction proteins occludin and occludin-1 (16Kevil C.G. Payne D.K. Mire E. Alexander J.S.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 882-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). VEGF exhibits high affinity binding to two distinct receptor tyrosine kinases, the Fms-like tyrosine kinase Flt-1 and the Flk-1/KDR (21Takahashi T. Shibuya M. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 2079-2089Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar, 22de Vries C. Escobedo J.A. Ueno H. Houck K. Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Science. 1992; 255: 989-991Crossref PubMed Scopus (1875) Google Scholar). Flk-1/KDR and not Flt-1 is able to mediate the mitogenic and chemotactic effects of VEGF in endothelial cells. VEGF stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ, mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, FAK, and paxillin in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and of phospholipase Cγ, p120GAP, and NCK in bovine aortic endothelial cells (23Abedi H.

However, the key targets that mediate the diverse biological functions of VEGF in endothelial cells remain incompletely understood for both VEGF receptors. Attachment of cells to the extracellular matrix (ECM; e.g. laminin, fibronectin, and collagen) is mediated by structures called “focal adhesions,” which connect the extracellular matrix with the plasma membrane and the underlying actin cytoskeletal network. Attachment of cells to the ECM results in the clustering of integrin receptors and initiates the recruitment of numerous cytoplasmic proteins to the focal adhesion complex. These proteins include both structural and catalytically active signaling proteins. Signaling through focal adhesions regulates a variety of cellular processes including cell growth, migration, and apoptosis (27Burridge K. Chrzanowska-Wodnicka M. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1996; 12: 463-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Focal adhesions are dynamic structures, and thus, their formation and breakdown are regulated by many different extracellular stimuli. Clustering of integrin subunits by ECM, growth factor stimulation (platelet-derived growth factor and epidermal growth factor), and signaling through certain G protein-coupled receptors (such as the receptor for lysophosphatidic acid) have been shown to result in focal adhesion formation. Formation of these complexes has been shown to require the activity of the small GTP-binding protein Rho (30Richardson A. Parsons T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 31Richardson A. Malik R.K. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6906-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). Activation of tyrosine kinases is a prerequisite for focal adhesion assembly because inhibitors of tyrosine kinase activity block cell adhesion and focal adhesion formation (28Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar). Clustering of integrins appears sufficient to recruit FAK and tensin and results in the autophosphorylation and activation of FAK (29Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). FAK is recruited to clustered integrins by a direct interaction of the N-terminal domain of FAK and the cytoplasmic domain of the β-integrin subunits. Subsequent tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr397 (proximal to the kinase domain) creates a binding site for Src, resulting in the formation of a complex consisting of the two tyrosine kinases. The formation of the FAK/Src complex results in the activation of Src and the subsequent activation of downstream signals (28Parsons J.T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 146-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 29Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). The C terminus of FAK contains binding sites for a number of signaling molecules including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, Crk-associated substrate, GRB2, paxillin, and the GTPase regulator associated with FAK. In some cells, the C-terminal domain of FAK is expressed as a separate protein called FRNK (FAK-related non-kinase), whose overexpression results in inhibition of the rate of cell spreading and cell migration (30Richardson A. Parsons T. Nature. 1996; 380: 538-540Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 31Richardson A. Malik R.K. Hildebrand J.D. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6906-6914Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). These effects can be rescued by overexpression of FAK or Src, indicating that FRNK can act as a biological inhibitor of FAK signaling. We have previously cloned and characterized the related adhesion focal tyrosine kinase (RAFTK), also known as Pyk2, CAK-β, and CADTK. RAFTK is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that is related to FAK (32Avraham H. Price D.J. Methods. 1999; 17: 250-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 33Avraham S. London R. Fu Y. Ota S.

It is implicated in the regulation of ion channel activity, stress responses, cell adhesion/cytoskeletal reorganization, vesicle trafficking, and nerve growth factor signaling (40Park S.Y. Avraham H. Avraham S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19768-19777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). RAFTK, which regulates various cellular functions, is emerging as a critical “platform kinase” upon which a number of signaling molecules integrate (41Avraham H. Park S.Y. Schinkmann K. Avraham S. Cell Signalling. 2000; 12: 123-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). RAFTK also associates with focal adhesion-like structures, participates in integrin-mediated signaling in megakaryocytes, and is tyrosine-phosphorylated following β1-integrin or B cell antigen receptor stimulation in B cells (42Astier A. Manie S.N. Avraham H. Hirai H. Law S.F. Zhang Y. Golemis E.A. Fu Y. Druker B.J. Haghayeghi N. Freedman A.S. Avraham S. J. Biol.

The assembly and disassembly of focal adhesions play a key role in the mechanism by which several extracellular stimuli regulate both cell morphology and movement. The assembly of focal adhesions in brain microvascular endothelial cells was reported (26Stoletov K.V. Ratcliffe K.E. Spring S.C. Terman B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22748-22755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 43Shono T. Kanetake H. Kanda S. Exp. Cell Res. 2001; 264: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this study, we explored the cell signaling proteins that couple VEGF binding to its receptors with focal adhesion assembly in HBMECs. Materials—Human recombinant VEGF165 and anti-human VEGF monoclonal antibody were obtained from Genentech, Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Monoclonal antibodies for αvβ5 (P1F6) were used for integrin immunoprecipitation, and rabbit polyclonal anti-β5 antibodies were used for immunoblotting. Monoclonal antibodies for p130 cas and paxillin were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). Cell Culture—HBMECs were purchased from Cell Systems, Inc. (Kirkland, WA). The cells were seeded onto attachment factor-coated culture plates and maintained in CSC complete medium according to the protocol of the manufacturer. The HBMECs formed tubular-like networks on Matrigel and produced the endothelial-specific marker, von Willebrand factor, indicating that these cells maintained the general properties of endothelial cells. Interestingly, the in vitro resistance in both rat brain microvascular endothelial cells and human brain microvascular endothelial cells is very unique, and showed measurements of 1200–1900 ohm cm2 as compared with 10–20 ohm cm2 in peripheral endothelial cells, in accordance with previous reports (44Rubin L.L. Staddon J.M. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1999; 22: 11-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (828) Google Scholar). During the course of the experiment, the cells were routinely checked for expression of von Willebrand factor. The cells in this study were used until passages 4–6. HBMECs were maintained in F-10 medium supplemented with 4% fetal bovine serum, 5% penicillin/streptomycin, 1% glutamine, 1% heparin, 0.7% endothelial mitogen, and 15% horse serum, and the cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Western Blotting—The cells were lysed in kinase lysis buffer (New England Biolabs). The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Millipore, Boston, MA). The membranes were blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS and subsequently incubated with primary antibody for overnight incubation at 4 °C. Bound antibodies were detected by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences). Focal Adhesion Assay—HBMECs were seeded onto the indicated substrate-coated coverslips: fibronectin (20 μg/ml) and gelatin (0.2%). After 4 h of incubation in serum-free CSC medium, the cells were stimulated with VEGF (20 ng/ml) for the indicated times. The cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at room temperature, and treated with blocking buffer (0.1% goat serum and 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS). Polyclonal anti-FAK (1:500) antibodies or anti-RAFTK antibodies (1:1000) were generated in our lab as detailed previously (36Hiregowdara D. Avraham H. Fu Y. London R. Avraham S. J. Biol.

Monoclonal antibody for vinculin (1:250) or control antibody was added, followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to fluorescein (1:200). For the labeling of F-actin, Texas Red-phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (1:1000) was used. The cells were then washed again and mounted in anti-fading compound (phenylenediamine; 1 mg/ml, 50% glycerol with PBS). The fluorescent signals were detected by optical sectioning using a Leica TCS-NT confocal laser scanning microscope. A minimum of 400 cells/condition were evaluated for the presence of focal adhesions. The cells that are positive usually have ∼15–30 plaques/cell. The cells with less than 5–7 plaques/cell were scored as negative. The experiments were repeated a minimum of three times. Cell Migration Assay and Cell Spreading—The migration assay utilized a modified Boyden chamber and was performed essentially as previously described. The cells were grown to 50% confluency and then either untreated or infected with adenoviral constructs for 2 h as described below. The cells were lifted from the dish using nonenzymatic cell dissociation solution (Sigma), centrifuged for 2 min at 1000 rpm, and resuspended in medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. The cells were then plated on fibronectin-precoated Transwells (Costar Corp.) at a density of 105 cells/well. Medium with VEGF (10 ng/ml) was used as a chemoattractant in the lower wells. Cell migration assays were performed for 8 h at 37 °C. The cells that migrated through the Transwells were stained with chloromethylfluorescein diacetate dye (Sigma) and counted under a fluorescent microscope. Four different fields were counted for each experiment, and all of the samples were performed in triplicate. For cell spreading, the cells were detached with 1 mm EDTA and washed with PBS, and then 1 × 105 cells were plated on fibronectin-coated coverslips in serum-free medium. After the indicated times, the coverslips were fixed, stained, and analyzed by fluorescent microscopy. For quantification of the spreading cells, 150–200 cells were scored from each of three independent experiments. Adenovirus Constructs and Infections—Replication-deficient recombinant adenoviruses mediating overexpression have been previously described (45Melendez J. Welch S. Schaefer E. Moravec C.S. Avraham S. Avraham H. Sussman M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45203-45210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). RAFTK/Pyk2 cDNA fragments encoding both wild type (Pyk2/RAFTK-WT) and a phosphorylation-deficient mutant (Pyk2/RAFTK-Y402) were used to create replication-defective recombinant adenoviruses with the AdEasy system (Microbix Biosystem Inc.) as directed by the manufacturer. The Tyr402 residue of RAFTK is the autophosphorylation site that also binds and activates Src. Mutation in this residue blocks autophosphorylation of RAFTK and its binding to Src, leading to the abrogation of Src phosphorylation. Subconfluent HBMEC cultures were infected with recombinant adenoviruses, including β-galactosidase expressing adenovirus as a control, for 2 h at a multiplicity of infection of 10, and then the medium was aspirated and replaced with maintenance medium. The lysates for the biochemical analyses were prepared ∼24–48 h after infection. A replication-defective adenovirus encoding GFP-tagged FRNK was also constructed as previously described (46Heidkamp M.C. Bayer A.L. Kalina J.A. Eble D.M. Samarel A.M. Circ. Res. 2002; 90: 1240-1242Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). An adenovirus expressing GFP alone was used to control for the nonspecific effects of adenoviral infection. HBMECs were infected at a multiplicity of infection of 10 for 2 h at 25 °C with gentle agitation with replication-defective adenoviruses diluted in medium. The medium was then replaced with virus-free medium, and the cells were cultured for an additional 48 h before assaying for cell migration and focal adhesion assembly. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblotting—For co-immunoprecipitation of FAK with integrin αvβ5, HBMECs were lysed in HNG buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol) containing 1% Brje.

Differences among the means were considered significant at p < 0.05. The data were analyzed using the SigmaStat statistical software package, version 1.0 (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). HBMECs as a Model System—We chose to carry out these studies in HBMECs because of their direct application as a model system for the in vivo system of the human BBB and for their high relevance to the studies of ischemia and stroke in humans. HBMECs formed tubular-like networks on Matrigel and had the ability to uptake acetylated low density lipoprotein (47Lee T.H. Avraham H. Lee S.H. Avraham S. J. Biol.

HBMECs also produced γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, a brain endothelial marker. HBMECs maintained the unique characteristic of resistance greater than 1000–2000 ohm/cm2 as compared with the 10–20 ohm/cm2 characteristic of peripheral endothelial cells. HBMECs constitute the major component of the BBB and are therefore critical in maintaining its structural and functional integrity. VEGF Induced the Formation of Focal Adhesions—Cell adhesion to ECM is a highly dynamic process involving structures heterogeneous with respect to size, composition, and orientation to actin filaments (50O'Neill G.M. Fashena S.J. Golemis E.A. Trends Cell Biol. 2000; 10: 111-119Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar, 51Clark E.A. Brugge J.S.

The largest and tightest structures are usually referred to as focal adhesions, which link the actin cytoskeleton to ECM by integrin receptor complexes. Actin-binding proteins that co-localize with integrins in focal adhesions include actin, talin, vinculin, and tensin. Focal contacts were detected by staining the fixed cells either with the monoclonal antibody to vinculin, a cytoskeletal protein that localizes at focal adhesion contacts (52Broday D.M. Bull.

Oncogene. 2000; 19: 5606-5613Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar). To analyze whether VEGF can induce focal adhesion formation in brain microvascular endothelial cells and to determine the specific role of integrins in VEGF-mediated focal adhesion assembly, HBMECs were grown overnight on coverslips coated with fibronectin (20 μg/ml) (integrin-dependent) or gelatin (0.2%) (integrin-independent). After 4 h of incubation in serum-free CSC medium, the cells were stimulated with VEGF (20 ng/ml) for 1 or 4 h as indicated. The cells were then fixed and immunostained for FAK- and RAFTK-specific antibodies. Actin stress fibers were also analyzed using Texas Red-phalloidin (Molecular Probes). Clear actin stress fibers that cross the cell body and condense at the cell periphery were observed in HBMECs (Fig. 1, red). No focal adhesion sites were observed when HBMECs were seeded on gelatin (0.2%). Upon VEGF stimulation for 1 h, we observed the dynamic redistribution of FAK with actin in the outer membrane, which was increased upon 4 h of stimulation of the HBMECs with VEGF. When HBMECs were seeded on fibronectin, upon 1 h of treatment with VEGF, a significant co-redistribution of FAK with actin to the outer side of the cells was enhanced (Fig. 1B). After 4 h of stimulation with VEGF, there was a significant increase in the dynamic co-redistribution of FAK and actin with the formation of focal contacts. Similarly, focal contacts immunostained with RAFTK/Pyk2 were detected after their seeding on fibronectin and stimulation with VEGF (Fig. 1C). These results suggest that VEGF plays a role in focal adhesion assembly in HBMECs and that FAK and RAFTK/Pyk2 are important components of these focal adhesion sites. To further analyze the effects of VEGF on focal adhesion assemb"

Caffeine has been widely used to study ATM and ATR signaling because it inhibits these kinases in vitro and overcomes cell cycle checkpoint responses in vivo. Thus, caffeine has been thought to overcome the checkpoint through its ability to prevent phosphorylation of ATM and ATR substrates. Surprisingly, I have found that multiple ATM-ATR substrates including CHK1 and -2 are hyperphosphorylated in cells treated with caffeine and genotoxic agents such as hydroxyurea or ionizing radiation. ATM autophosphorylation in cells is also increased when caffeine is used in combination with inhibitors of replication suggesting that ATM activity is not inhibited in vivo by caffeine. Furthermore, CHK1 hyperphosphorylation induced by caffeine in combination with hydroxyurea is ATR-dependent suggesting that ATR activity is stimulated by caffeine. Finally, the G2/M checkpoint in response to ionizing radiation or hydroxyurea is abrogated by caffeine treatment without a corresponding decrease in ATM-ATR-dependent signaling. This data suggests that although caffeine is an inhibitor of ATM-ATR kinase activity in vitro, it can block checkpoints without inhibiting ATM-ATR activation in vivo.

DNA damage-initiated cell cycle checkpoints are principally regulated by the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) 1The abbreviations used are: ATM, ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated; IR, ionizing radiation; ATR, ATM- and Rad3-related; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Ad, adenovirus; PIK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein kinase.1The abbreviations used are: ATM, ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated; IR, ionizing radiation; ATR, ATM- and Rad3-related; GFP, green fluorescent protein; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; Ad, adenovirus; PIK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; DNA-PK, DNA-dependent protein kinase. and ATM- and Rad3-related (ATR) protein kinases that belong to a family of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PIK)-related kinases (1Shiloh Y.

ATM and ATR share sequence homology and many of the same substrates. They differ with respect to which types of genotoxic stresses promote their activation. ATM primarily responds to agents such as ionizing radiation (IR) that cause DNA double strand breaks, whereas ATR signals in response to IR and many agents that cause bulky adducts on DNA or otherwise cause stalling of replication forks and generation of single-stranded DNA. ATM and ATR are also activated by different methods. ATM activation requires autophosphorylation that results in the disruption of an ATM dimer (3Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2669) Google Scholar). How autophosphorylation is triggered is still unknown. ATR is also capable of autophosphorylation, but it is unclear whether it forms inactive dimers and active monomers in cells. Activation of ATR signaling appears to be dependent on localization of ATR to regions of single-stranded DNA, which is accomplished through the function of the ATRIP regulatory subunit (4Cortez D.

ATM and ATR signal to induce cell cycle arrest in part by activating a signaling cascade involving two other protein kinases CHK2 and -1. CHK2 is phosphorylated by ATM on Thr-68, and this phosphorylation promotes CHK2 activation (6Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

This phosphorylation decreases Cdc25C activity and sequesters it in the cytoplasm by creating a binding site for 14-3-3 proteins. Inactivation of Cdc25C prevents dephosphorylation and activation of cyclin B-cdc2, thereby inhibiting mitosis. Thus, ATM and ATR signal in response to DNA damage to activate the G2/M checkpoint through phosphorylation of CHK1-CHK2, which prevent activation of mitotic cyclin-dependent kinases. Other ATM and ATR substrates, such as p53, BRCA1, and SMC1, participate in multiple checkpoint responses (15Canman C.E. Lim D.S. Cimprich K.A. Taya Y. Tamai K. Sakaguchi K. Appella E. Kastan M.B.

Ataxia-telangiectasia cells are hypersensitive to IR and exhibit defects in G1, S, and G2/M checkpoints in response to IR. ATR is essential for cell viability and mouse development, and transient loss of ATR function causes extreme chromosomal instability (4Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J.

Recently, a hypomorphic mutation in the ATR gene was linked to Seckel syndrome, which is characterized by growth retardation, microcephaly, and mental retardation (25O'Driscoll M. Ruiz-Perez V.L. Woods C.G. Jeggo P.A. Goodship J.A. Nat. Genet. 2003; 33: 497-501Crossref PubMed Scopus (629) Google Scholar). Caffeine is a methylxanthine that has been used extensively to study ATM-ATR signaling and checkpoint responses. Caffeine is a relatively non-selective agent and causes many effects in cells. For example, caffeine inhibits the nucleotide exchange activity of RCC1 (26Nishijima H. Nishitani H. Saito N. Nishimoto T. Genes Cells. 2003; 8: 423-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar), alkaline phosphatase activity (27Wharton W. Goz B. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1979; 28: 763-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and phosphodiesterase activity (28Beavo J.A. Rogers N.L. Crofford O.B. Hardman J.G. Sutherland E.W. Newman E.V. Mol.

One of the most studied actions of caffeine is its ability to cause radiosensitization and to inhibit cell cycle checkpoints. p53-deficient cells appear to be preferentially sensitized to IR by caffeine (30Yao S.L. Akhtar A.J. McKenna K.A. Bedi G.C. Sidransky D. Mabry M. Ravi R. Collector M.I. Jones R.J. Sharkis S.J. Fuchs E.J. Bedi A. Nat.

Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 1643-1648PubMed Google Scholar). Caffeine has also been shown to inhibit multiple ATM-ATR-dependent cell cycle checkpoint responses including the G2/M- and S-phase checkpoints (32Rowley R. Radiat. Res. 1992; 129: 224-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 33Lau C.C. Pardee A.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 2942-2946Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 34Schlegel R. Pardee A.B. Science. 1986; 232: 1264-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). The ability of caffeine to produce phenotypes that are similar to ATM-ATR-deficient cellular phenotypes suggested that it might act to inhibit these kinases. Several reports have shown that addition of caffeine to immunopurified ATM and ATR kinases prevents phosphorylation of substrates in vitro (35Hall-Jackson C.A. Cross D.A. Morrice N. Smythe C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6707-6713Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 36Zhou B.B. Chaturvedi P. Spring K. Scott S.P. Johanson R.A. Mishra R. Mattern M.R. Winkler J.D. Khanna K.K. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar). ATM is inhibited by caffeine with an IC50 of 0.2 mm, whereas ATR is inhibited with an IC50 of 1.1 mm. The related PIK kinase mTOR is also inhibited with an IC50 of 0.4 mm, but DNA-PK and CHK1 are relatively resistant to caffeine with an IC50 of greater than 10 mm (38Sarkaria J.N. Busby E.C. Tibbetts R.S. Roos P. Taya Y. Karnitz L.M. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar). These concentrations for ATM and ATR inhibition in vitro are consistent with the concentrations of caffeine needed to cause radiosensitization and inhibition of checkpoints in vivo. Based on these findings it was proposed that caffeine causes checkpoint inhibition in cells by inhibiting ATM and ATR. Consistent with this conclusion the phosphorylation of CHK1, CHK2, and p53 can be reduced by caffeine treatment in some circumstances (11Zhao H. Piwnica-Worms H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4129-4139Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar, 36Zhou B.B. Chaturvedi P. Spring K. Scott S.P. Johanson R.A. Mishra R. Mattern M.R. Winkler J.D. Khanna K.K. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 2001; 154: 913-923Crossref PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar). Based on these results caffeine has been used extensively as an inhibitor of ATM and ATR to study loss of function phenotypes. Furthermore, the ability of caffeine to cause radiosensitization of cells has supported the idea that inhibitors of checkpoints generally and ATM-ATR specifically may be useful clinically as radio- and chemo-sensitizing agents (40Hartwell L.H. Kastan M.B. Science. 1994; 266: 1821-1828Crossref PubMed Scopus (2305) Google Scholar). In the course of studying ATR-dependent signaling events, I observed that some ATM-ATR substrates such as p53 and CHK2 were hyperphosphorylated in the absence of ATR. I suspected this was due to a feedback mechanism involving activation of ATM in these cells. To confirm this hypothesis I attempted to use caffeine to inhibit both ATM and ATR. Surprisingly, I found that treatment of cells with caffeine does not prevent ATM-ATR-dependent phosphorylation of CHK1 and -2 yet still inhibits checkpoints initiated by IR and hydroxyurea. Thus, at least in some cellular contexts caffeine prevents checkpoint responses without directly inhibiting the ATM and ATR kinases. Cell Culture—HCT116 cells were maintained in McCoy's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. hTERT-RPE1 cells were obtained from Clontech and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F12 medium supplemented with 0.348% sodium bicarbonate and 10% fetal bovine serum. ATRflox/– cells were maintained in McCoy's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. M059J and M059K cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Deletion of the ATR gene from the ATRflox/– cells was performed as described previously (4Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). Drug Treatment and DNA Damage—Caffeine was purchased from Sigma (no. C8960). It was either dissolved in growth medium at a stock concentration of 80 mm just prior to use or dissolved in water at a concentration of 200 mm. Cells were pretreated with caffeine for 30 min prior to exposing them to any genotoxic agents. Hydroxyurea was purchased from Sigma, dissolved in water at 1 m, and stored frozen. Cells were treated with ionizing radiation from a 137Cs source at a dose rate of ∼1.8 grays/min. UV was administered with a Stratalinker (Stratagene) after cells were washed one time with PBS. Aphidicolin was purchased from Sigma, dissolved in Me2SO at 5 mg/ml, and stored at –80 degrees. Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 200 mm NaCl, 1% Igepal CA-630 supplemented with 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm NaF, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation prior to protein concentration determination (Bio-Rad). Anti-CHK1 P-S345, p53 P-S15, and anti-CHK2 P-T68 antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling. Anti-ATM P-S1981 antibodies were purchased from Rockland. Anti-ATM antibodies were purchased from Novus. Anti-CHK1 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz. Anti-P-H2AX antibody was purchased from Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions. Kinase Assay—ATM and ATR kinase assays were performed using recombinant FLAG-ATM or -ATR produced in HEK 293T cells. The FLAG-ATM and -ATR kinases were purified and assayed using a fragment of BRCA1 protein as described previously (17Cortez D. Wang Y. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 1999; 286: 1162-1166Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Checkpoint Assay—Untreated or treated cells were harvested and fixed in 70% ethanol. The fixed cells were washed twice with PBS and permeabilized with 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS on ice for 15 min. Permeabilized cells were rinsed in PBS-containing 1% bovine serum albumin and then stained with antiphospho-S10 histone H3 antibody for 1.5 h at room temperature. Cells were washed twice with PBS-containing 1% bovine serum albumin and then stained with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson Immunologicals). Cells were washed three times in PBS and then stained with propidium iodide (25 μg/ml) in the presence of 0.1 mg/ml RNase. Flow cytometry was performed on a BD Biosciences FACSCalibur flow cytometer, and the percentage of mitotic cells was determined as the percentage of those cells that were fluorescein isothiocyanate-positive and contained 4N DNA content. Loss of ATR Promotes Double Strand Breaks and Hyperphosphorylation of p53 and CHK2 in Response to Stalled Replication Forks—Hydroxyurea-treated cells arrest with stalled replication forks in S-phase due to the inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase. Stalling of replication forks promotes activation of an ATR-dependent checkpoint response that slows DNA replication, stabilizes replication forks, and prevents entry into mitosis (41Nyberg K.A. Michelson R.J. Putnam C.W. Weinert T.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 617-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar). To examine this checkpoint in more detail I analyzed the phosphorylation of ATR substrates such as CHK1 and p53 in response to hydroxyurea treatment in cells that had been engineered to contain a conditional allele of ATR (4Cortez D. Guntuku S. Qin J. Elledge S.J. Science. 2001; 294: 1713-1716Crossref PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar). These ATRflox/– cells can be induced to lose the ATR gene by introducing the CRE recombinase by adenoviral infection (AdCRE). Loss of ATR prevented the hydroxyurea-induced phosphorylation of CHK1 on Ser-345, which is required for CHK1 activation (Fig. 1A). This data is consistent with a requirement for ATR for CHK1 phosphorylation and activation. However, another putative ATR substrate p53 was actually hyperphosphorylated in response to hydroxyurea treatment in cells lacking ATR (Fig. 1A). p53 phosphorylation was also slightly elevated in untreated ATR-deficient cells compared with either wild-type cells treated with AdCRE or ATRflox/– cells treated with AdGFP. This hyperphosphorylation correlated with an increase in phosphorylation of CHK2 as measured by a gel mobility shift. CHK2 is phosphorylated on Thr-68 in an ATM-dependent manner in response to DNA damage such as double strand breaks (6Matsuoka S. Rotman G. Ogawa A. Shiloh Y. Tamai K. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10389-10394Crossref PubMed Scopus (684) Google Scholar). Loss of ATR has been reported to induce chromosomal abnormalities (22Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 397-402PubMed Google Scholar, 42Brown E.J. Baltimore D. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 615-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). Therefore I suspected that the increased CHK2 and p53 phosphorylation in ATR-deficient cells was due to an increase in double strand breaks that might form at stalled replication forks when ATR is absent. Consistent with this hypothesis, H2AX phosphorylation was increased in ATR-deficient cells both before and after treatment with hydroxyurea (Fig. 1B). Furthermore, ATM phosphorylation on Ser-1981 is also increased both before and after treatment of ATR-deficient cells with DNA-damaging agents or replication inhibitors (Fig. 1C). Ser-1981 is an autophosphorylation site on ATM that promotes its activity by disrupting the inactive ATM dimer (3Bakkenist C.J. Kastan M.B. Nature. 2003; 421: 499-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (2669) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is likely that the increase in CHK2 and p53 phosphorylation that I observed in the hydroxyurea-treated ATR-deficient cells was due to the formation of double strand breaks and activation of the ATM pathway. Loss of ATR increases the amount of double strand breaks and activates ATM in cells both before and after treatment with genotoxic agents. Caffeine Promotes Hyperphosphorylation of ATM-ATR Substrates—To confirm that ATM was indeed required for the p53 and CHK2 phosphorylation in the absence of ATR, I attempted to use caffeine to inhibit both kinases. Caffeine has been reported to inhibit the ATM kinase at an IC50 of 0.2 mm and the ATR kinase at an IC50 of 1.1 mm (35Hall-Jackson C.A. Cross D.A. Morrice N. Smythe C. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6707-6713Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 36Zhou B.B. Chaturvedi P. Spring K. Scott S.P. Johanson R.A. Mishra R. Mattern M.R. Winkler J.D. Khanna K.K. J. Biol.

Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the intracellular concentration of caffeine quickly equilibrates with the extracellular concentration (43Rowley R. Martin J.H. Leeper D.B. Radiat. Res. 1988; 113: 58-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Therefore treatment of ATR+/+ cells with concentrations of caffeine between 2 and 16 mm should inhibit both ATM and ATR kinases. I pretreated HCT116 cells with caffeine, added hydroxyurea, and then analyzed the phosphorylation of multiple ATM and ATR substrates by immunoblotting with antiphosphopeptide-specific antibodies or by analyzing gel mobility shifts. I expected a dose-dependent decrease in substrate phosphorylation, but I observed a dose-dependent increase of CHK1, replication protein A, CHK2, and p53 phosphorylation (Fig. 2A). Hyperphosphorylation of these ATM-ATR substrates might be expected if caffeine transiently inhibited ATM and ATR but then was degraded and no longer present. To test this I first checked whether caffeine treatment inhibited CHK1 phosphorylation at earlier times after hydroxyurea exposure. There was a similar dose-dependent increase in CHK1 phosphorylation at 2 h after hydroxyurea exposure (Fig. 2B). Addition of fresh caffeine and growth medium every hour during the hydroxyurea treatment also failed to inhibit CHK1 phosphorylation (data not shown). The ATM and ATR kinases belong to the PIK class of kinases that can be inhibited by wortmannin. I confirmed that the caffeine-induced hyperphosphorylation of CHK1 and replication protein A was at least partially sensitive to wortmannin suggesting the involvement of a PIK kinase (Fig. 2C). The dose of wortmannin (20 μm) used is expected to efficiently inhibit ATM and DNA-PK while partially inhibiting ATR (44Sarkaria J.N. Tibbetts R.S. Busby E.C. Kennedy A.P. Hill D.E. Abraham R.T. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 4375-4382PubMed Google Scholar). DNA-PK has been reported to phosphorylate some ATR and ATM substrates and is wortmannin-sensitive, so I examined whether the caffeine-stimulated hyperphosphorylation of CHK1 was dependent on DNA-PK. I saw no difference between the ability of caffeine to affect CHK1 phosphorylation after hydroxyurea treatment in DNA-PK-proficient or -deficient cells (Fig. 3A) suggesting that DNA-PK is not involved. These cells also express reduced levels of ATM and harbor an ATM mutation (45Tsuchida R. Yamada T. Takagi M. Shimada A. Ishioka C. Katsuki Y. Igarashi T. Chessa L. Delia D. Teraoka H. Mizutani S. Radiat. Res. 2002; 158: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) suggesting that ATM is also not involved in the CHK1 phosphorylation. The caffeine-induced hyperphosphorylation of ATM-ATR substrates is not limited to cells treated with hydroxyurea. I used aphidicolin as another agent that can block replication fork progression and found that CHK1 phosphorylation at 6 h after aphidicolin addition is also stimulated by caffeine (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, I directly examined ATM autophosphorylation using the phospho-S1981 ATM antibody and found that caffeine promoted phosphorylation on this site in the presence of aphidicolin (Fig. 3B). ATM and ATR Signaling Is Not Inhibited in Vivo by Caffeine—HCT116 cells are a colon carcinoma cell line that harbors many mutations. To ensure that caffeine's effect on ATM-ATR-dependent phosphorylation events was not limited to this tumor cell line I analyzed its effects in telomerase-immortalized human retinal pigment epithelial cells (hTERT-RPE1). Both ATM autophosphorylation as well as phosphorylation of the ATM substrate CHK2 are increased when caffeine is added to hTERT-RPE1 cells in addition to hydroxyurea (Fig. 4A). The increase in phosphorylation of Ser-1981 on ATM caused by adding caffeine and inhibitors of replication suggests that caffeine may promote the activation of ATM in these cells. As ATM activation is normally a response to double strand breaks I tested whether caffeine had an effect on IR-induced ATM activation. I found that ATM autophosphorylation was already maximal with 5 grays of IR and that caffeine did not decrease this phosphorylation. Furthermore, caffeine consistently caused a slight increase in CHK2 phosphorylation on Thr-68 and also increased CHK1 phosphorylation in a dose-dependent manner after ionizing radiation treatment (Fig. 4A). This data is inconsistent with an inhibitory function of caffeine on ATM in vivo and suggests that caffeine may promote the activation of ATM in cells. It is interesting to note that the level of ATM autophosphorylation did not strictly correlate with the amount of CHK2 Thr-68 phosphorylation. For example, hydroxyurea treatment in the presence of 4 or 8 mm caffeine caused nearly the same amount of ATM autophosphorylation on Ser-1981 as did IR treatment, but the level of CHK2 Thr-68 phosphorylation was much less. This observation suggests that there must be additional mechanisms regulating CHK2 phosphorylation besides the disruption of the ATM dimer by Ser-1981 autophosphorylation. I have observed a requirement for ATR for CHK1 phosphorylation in response to UV, hydroxyurea, and IR in HCT116 cells using the ATRflox/– system (see Fig. 1) (data not shown), yet caffeine treatment stimulates CHK1 phosphorylation in response to hydroxyurea and IR suggesting it may function to activate ATR signaling. If caffeine does function as an activator of ATR then CHK1 hyperphosphorylation in response to caffeine treatment should be dependent on ATR. I tested this by treating ATRflox/– cells with hydroxyurea in the presence or absence of caffeine. The control AdGFP-infected cells containing ATR showed increased CHK1 phosphorylation at the 6-h time point after hydroxyurea treatment when caffeine was present and showed no evidence of caffeine inhibition at earlier time points. However, this caffeine-stimulated CHK1 phosphorylation was not observed in the AdCRE-infected cells, which have lost the ATR gene even though ATM was activated based on the presence of Ser-1981 phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). Thus, the caffeine-induced hyperphosphorylation of CHK1 is ATR-dependent. This data also shows that Ser-345 of CHK1 is not capable of being phosphorylated by active ATM in the absence of ATR. Caffeine Is an Inhibitor of ATM-ATR in Vitro and an Inhibitor of the G2 /M Checkpoint in Vivo—Previous publications have documented that caffeine is an inhibitor of the ATM and ATR kinases in vitro and an inhibitor of checkpoint responses in cells. However, my data indicated that at least in the cell types and conditions that I examined, caffeine did not inhibit ATM or ATR. This could be explained if the caffeine was inactivated, metabolized, or unable to enter the cells in the growth conditions that I employed. Therefore, I tested whether the caffeine would inhibit ATM and ATR in vitro and whether it would inhibit the checkpoint in the same cells in which a hyperactivation of ATM-ATR signaling is observed. Consistent with previous publications, ATM kinase activity was inhibited at low (1 mm) concentrations of caffeine in vitro. Both autophosphorylation and trans-phosphorylation of the BRCA1 substrate were inhibited (Fig. 5A"

In experiments beneath a thick, sliding glacier, ice containing 2 to 11% debris exerted shear traction of 60 to 200 kilopascals on a smooth rock bed, comparable to the total shear traction beneath glaciers and contrary to the usual assumption that debris-bed friction is negligible. Imposed pore-water pressure that was 60 to 100% of the normal stress in a subglacial debris layer reduced shear traction on the debris sufficiently to halt its deformation and cause slip of ice over the debris. Slip resistance was thus less than debris shearing resistance."

This model can explain a number of results from previous mutagenesis analyses and permits new verifiable insights into the structural and functional properties of these enzymes. The main secretory product of the thyroid gland is a prohormone thyroxine (T4), which must be monodeiodinated to 3,3′,5-triiodothyronine (T3) by removal of an outer ring iodine to permit its binding to nuclear T3 receptors. These ligand-dependent transcription factors regulate genes critical for normal growth, central nervous system development, and energy homeostasis in all vertebrates (1Zhang J. Lazar M.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2000; 62: 439-466Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). The specific monodeiodination of T4 in the outer ring is catalyzed by the types 1 or 2 iodothyronine selenodeiodinases (D1 or D2). Termination or prevention of thyroid hormone action is controlled by the inner ring deiodination of T3 or T4, respectively, catalyzed by a third deiodinase, D3. Thus, specific iodothyronine monodeiodinations are critical steps in both the activation and inactivation of thyroid hormones (2Bianco A.C. Salvatore D. Gereben B. Berry M.J. Larsen P.R. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 38-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). The complex regulation of the activities of these selenocysteine (Sec)-containing enzymes permits modulation of T3 concentrations in specific cells controlling processes diverse as metamorphosis and adaptive thermogenesis. In adult vertebrates, the role of the deiodinases is primarily homeostatic, adjusting T3 production in response to environmental stresses such as iodine deficiency, starvation, or thermal challenges. In addition, the rapid conversion of T4 to T3 by D2 in the central nervous system and pituitary permits accurate monitoring of circulating T4, allowing the feedback regulation of thyroid-stimulating hormone secretion based in part upon circulating pro-hormone (T4) concentrations (2Bianco A.C. Salvatore D. Gereben B. Berry M.J. Larsen P.R. Endocr. Rev. 2002; 23: 38-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (1103) Google Scholar). Although there are important differences among the three deiodinases with respect to their catalytic functions, they have notable similarities. All are integral membrane proteins of 29-33 kDa and have regions of high similarity in the area surrounding the active center Sec, the critical residue that confers deiodinases with high catalytic activity (3Berry M.J.

Although there is some structure-function information available, particularly for D1, our understanding of the catalytic mechanisms and three-dimensional conformation of these proteins is limited because of the inability to synthesize large quantities of soluble, catalytically active proteins for crystallization purposes. This is a result both of the apparent importance of the transmembrane (TM) domain as well as the major differences in the pathways for selenoprotein synthesis between prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms (2Bianco A.C.

Strategy—Overlap extension PCR or restriction digestion were used to create single or multiple mutations in the deiodinase structures to test the reliability of our predicted three-dimensional model of the active center (Fig. 4). The choice of amino acids was made based on the chemical conservation of several positions within the whole deiodinase family with respect to the conserved features of the thioredoxin (TRX) and GH templates. The mutations were made on wild type deiodinase sequences fused to a FLAG peptide in the NH2 terminus, previously shown not to interfere with catalysis (7Curcio-Morelli C. Gereben B. Zavacki A.M.

The three deiodinase proteins (D1, D2, and D3) show considerable similarity (∼ 50% sequence identity, Fig. 1). Their general structure indicates a single TM segment, which is present in the NH2 termini of D1, D2, and D3 (Fig. 1, shaded light yellow), whereas several clusters typical of α-helices or β-strands are found well conserved, suggesting that they could correspond to core secondary structures of the deiodinase globular domains. Loops of variable lengths can be identified between conserved clusters. The first large one (Fig. 1, designated H) probably corresponds to a hinge separating the predicted TM segment from the globular domain. We used deiodinase sequences as queries in PSI-BLAST searches (17Altschul S.F. Madden T.L. Schaffer A.A. Zhang J. Zhang Z. Miller W. Lipman D.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 3389-3402Crossref PubMed Scopus (59929) Google Scholar) (default values, nonredundant (NR, 1,027,609 sequences), and Swiss-Protein (SW 100,395 sequences) databases at NCBI). Just below the significance threshold value (expected E-value > 10-3), we observed similarities with various members of the TRX or TRX-like families. The first hit of a search against the NR data base using the D1 sequence as query was the thiol:disulfide interchange protein from Deinococcus radiodurans (DR0345, E-value of 0.95; 27% identity over the 84 amino acids 86-169 of D1), whereas the first hit of a similar search against the Swiss-Protein data base with the D2 sequence was the TRX-H-type 2 (TRX-H2) and TRX-H-type 4 (TRX-H4) from Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica napus, respectively (E-value of 0.36 and 0.38, respectively; 37% over the 40 amino acids 124-163 of D2). These similarities are centered on the deiodinase Sec-containing active center (Fig. 1, X, shaded orange), which is aligned with the first of the active-site Cys of TRXs. In the TRX-fold family, not all of the members have a redox-active disulfide. Instead, the glutathione peroxidase (GPX) indeed has a Sec that interacts with glutathione substrate, which can be aligned with the accessible Cys of the redox protein (the first Cys of the couple) (Fig. 1) (18Martin J.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). Within the TRX-fold family, the deiodinase can thus also be compared with GPX, both having a Sec that can be aligned with the first active Cys of the TRX redox couple. Both are also characterized by a ping-pong reaction mechanism with a specific first substrate (R-OH or iodothyronine) and a thiol second substrate. The observed similarities with TRX and TRX-like proteins were further strengthened at a two-dimensional level using HCA as they are associated with a predicted conservation of structural features (Fig. 1). In both families of proteins, the “active” Cys or Sec is located in a loop separating a β-strand and an α-helix corresponding to the β1/α1-structures of the TRX fold (Fig. 1, red and orange). The β-strand COOH-terminal to the α-helix (Fig. 1, strand β2 of the TRX fold, yellow) is also well conserved, clearly indicating that the deiodinase region encompassing amino acids 115-156 (D1 numbering) corresponds to the βαβ motif of the TRX fold (Fig. 1, boxed). This hypothesis was further assessed by threading procedures, which significantly detected proteins of the GPX-like family within the structural classification of proteins (19Lo Conte L. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T.J. Chothia C. Murzin A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 264-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TRX-like fold superfamily (the structures of the thiol:disulfide interchange proteins CcmG/DsbE (Protein Data Bank code 1kng) and TlpA (1jfu) and of tryparedoxin-i (1qk8) were scored by three-dimensional position-specific scoring matrix (20Kelley L.A. MacCallum R.M. Sternberg M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 299: 499-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (1120) Google Scholar) with E-values of 0.0883, 0.0174, and 0.0976, respectively. Those of peroxiredoxin 5 (1hd2 and 1h4o) and TlpA (1jfu) were detected by FUGUE (21Shi J. Blundell T.L. Mizuguchi K. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 243-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (1081) Google Scholar) with Z-scores of 8.63, 8.41, and 7.51, respectively. However, no similarity could be found by PSI-BLAST with TRX-fold proteins downstream of the βαβ motif, suggesting that the COOH-terminal part of deiodinases is different from that of the TRX fold or that extra elements, which do not belong to the canonical TRX fold, locally interrupt the relationship that could be established with it. The latter hypothesis is supported by the fact that a ββα motif (Fig. 1, β3-β4-α3) is predicted at the end of the deiodinase sequences that might thus correspond to the ββα motif of the COOH-terminal part of the TRX fold. The intervening sequences including amino acids between 156 and 210 of deiodinase (D1 numbering) thus might correspond to distinct secondary structure elements added to the canonical TRX-fold core as observed in DsbA or in the GPX-like family, all of which are members of the TRX fold that have inserted residues forming separate domains or winding around the TRX fold (18Martin J.L. Structure. 1995; 3: 245-250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (693) Google Scholar). This hypothesis was further supported by the threading results in which significant alignments of the COOH-terminal ββα motifs were obtained with the COOH-terminal sequences of deiodinases. This structural correspondence is clearly documented by the similarities observed between the deiodinase sequences and proteins of the GPX-like family (Fig. 1). From the PSI-BLAST and threading results, we observed that the similarities between deiodinases and proteins of the GPX-like family (19Lo Conte L. Brenner S.E. Hubbard T.J. Chothia C. Murzin A.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 264-267Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to which the structurally characterized CcmG (22Edeling M.A. Guddat L.W. Fabianek R.A. Thony-Meyer L. Martin J.L. Structure. 2002; 10: 973-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and TlpA (23Capitani G. Rossmann R. Sargent D.F. Grutter M.G. Richmond T.J. Hennecke H. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 1037-1048Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) belong are not limited to the TRX βαβ and ββα motifs. These similarities are well supported and refined using HCA at the two-dimensional level, and interestingly, the strictly or highly conserved amino acids are located on positions that are also conserved in the whole family of thiol:disulfide interchange proteins (Fig. 1) that can therefore serve as reliable anchor points for the alignment. For example, one can note the strict conservation of an Ala-Pro motif (residues 92-93 in D1) preceding a cluster typical of a β-strand (βC), which is associated in CcmG and TlpA with an extended structure (strand βB in Figs. 1 and 2). Thus, deiodinases are predicted to have an NH2-terminal sequence similar to the NH2-terminal insert of CcmG and TlpA with three β-strands (βB, βC, and βD), two of which contribute to the β-sheet on the strand β2-side (Fig. 2). The large insertion found in the D2 sequence (18 amino acids within brackets on Fig. 1) lies exposed in the loop linking strand βC and βD (Fig. 2, ΔD2) in a similar place as the additional β-hairpin of CcmG (22Edeling M.A. Guddat L.W. Fabianek R.A. Thony-Meyer L. Martin J.L. Structure. 2002; 10: 973-979Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) and is probably located close to the active site. The two structures of CcmG and TlpA differ by the presence of an additional helix in the very NH2 terminus of TlpA, which does not exist in CcmG (Figs. 1 and 2, αA). In deiodinases, the presence of a large hydrophobic cluster, predicted as a α-helix followed by a predicted short β-strand just after the TM segment, suggests that the counterparts of the αA and βA structures could also be present. Although no clear amino acid similarities could be found for these structures between deiodinases and TlpA, such a hypothesis is supported at the two-dimensional level by the HCA and three-dimensional PSSM results. Selenodeiodinases and Iduronidases Share Common Structural Features within Their Respective Catalytic Regions— Thiol:disulfide interchange proteins have a second insertion between the two TRX βαβ and ββα motifs relative to the TRX canonical fold. This insertion provides an additional α-helix (Fig. 2, αB, white) lining the active site and also contributes to the β-sheet by adding one additional β-strand (Fig. 2, strand βE, pink). As deiodinases also have an insertion at the same place and as the presence of strands βC and βD in deiodinase should involve that of strand βE to form a continuous β-sheet, we hypothesize that the deiodinase insertion could also be similar to those found in the CcmG and TlpA structures. A putative alignment of strand βE (pink) was found with the VVVDT cluster, strongly predicted as a β-strand (amino acids 196-200 in D1), which is encircled by two clusters typical of helical structures aligned with the helices αB and α2 of the CcmG and TlpA structures (Fig. 1). Altogether, the alignment shown in Fig. 1 among D1, D2, D3, and the three GPX-like proteins, Dr0345, TlpA, and CcmG, is quantitatively assessed by statistical data (see legend of Fig. 1). With regards to this alignment, the region between amino acids 157 and 181 (D1 numbering) may thus correspond to a deiodinase-specific insertion relative to the CcmG and TlpA structures. This specific sequence may be crucial for the deiodinase function as it is positioned at least partially near the active site centered around the essential Sec residue (Fig. 2). This highly conserved, deiodinase-specific segment between amino acids 152 and 166 (D1 numbering) shares striking similarities with α-l-iduronidase (IDUA, 47% identity with D1 and D3, 60% with D2) as revealed by PSI-BLAST searches (Fig. 1, IDUA). Although marginal because of its small length (E-value of 53 with iduronidase from Canis familiaris when searching the Swiss-Protein data base with the D2 sequence as query), this similarity was further supported by HCA analysis, significantly extended along a full βαβαβ segment of nearly a hundred amino acids corresponding to the TRX-fold β1-α1-β2-αB-βE motif and assessed by a clear structural relationship between the GPX-TTR fold and this enzyme family (Fig. 3). Lysosomal α-l-iduronidase, which cleaves α-linked iduronic acid residues from the nonreducing end of the glycosaminoglycans, heparan sulfate, and dermatan sulfate belongs to family 39 of glycoside hydrolases (GH) (24Coutinho, P. M., and Henrissat, B. (1999) Carbohydrate-active Enzymes (afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/~cazy/CAZY/index.html)Google Scholar). This family is included in the larger clan GH-A whose different members share the same sugar retaining mechanism (retention of configuration of the anomeric carbon of the substrate) and the same structure (a (β/α)8 barrel in which the acid/base and the nucleophilic residues are located at the COOH-terminal end of strands β4 and β7, respectively) (15Henrissat B.

Henrissat B. Mornon J.P. Glycobiology. 1997; 7: 277-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These similarities led us to align strand β2 of the predicted TRX βαβ motif of deiodinase with strand β7 of the GH with the strict conservation of the Glu, which in iduronidase (Glu-299) acts as the nucleophilic residue (Figs. 1, 2, 3, shaded red) (26Brooks D.A.

Transfection of a double stranded RNA that targets the MMP-9 mRNA into COH cells depleted the corresponding mRNA and protein as demonstrated by reverse transcriptase-PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and gelatin zymography. proMMP-9 extinction resulted in the following: (i) decreased spreading on extracellular matrix (fibronectin, laminin, collagen IV)-coated surfaces, (ii) inhibition of migration toward fibronectin, and (iii) induced aggregation, which was specifically disrupted by a function-blocking E-cadherin antibody. MMP-9 knockdown concomitantly resulted in increased levels of surface E-cadherin, redistribution at the plasma membrane of β-catenin, and its physical association with E-cadherin. Moreover, induction of E-cadherin-mediated adhesion was associated with RhoA activation and changes in paxillin cytoskeleton. Finally, an inhibitor of gelatinolytic activity of pro-MMP9 did not reduce COH cell migration confirming that the enzymatic property of COH MMP-9 was not required for migration toward fibronectin.

Different families of adhesion receptors are likely to play a role in directing cell motility and include integrins, CAMs, and cadherins (16Alahari S.K. Redding P. Juliano R.L. Int. Rev.

Cadherins function by connecting cells to each other by homophilic interactions, in which they bind selectively to identical cadherin types. A cytoplasmic protein termed β-catenin interacts directly with the cadherin cytoplasmic domain and indirectly with the cytoskeleton via α-catenin, which interacts with actin and α-actinin (18Wong N.

M-PER™-mammalian protein extraction reagent and NE-PER™ nuclear and cytoplasmic extraction reagents were from Pierce. MMP-9 inhibitor 2(R)-2-[(4-biphenylsulfonyl)amino]-3-phenylpropionic acid was from Calbiochem.Cells—Human Ewing's sarcoma COH cells, wild-type p53 cells from a metastatic tumor localized on femur (41Hamelin R. Zucman J. Melot T. Delattre O. Thomas G. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 57: 336-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), were maintained in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen) containing 10% heat-inactivated FCS (Myoclone Plus; Invitrogen) and 10 μg/ml gentamycin in a humidified 37 °C incubator (5% CO2). COH cells were tested free of mycoplasma as assessed by RT-PCR (VenorGeM; Biovalley S. A.). In preliminary experiments, we controlled that trypsin treatment did not alter the levels of COH cell surface adhesion molecules (integrins, CAMs, and E-cadherin) as assessed by flow cytometry. Thus, cells were rapidly trypsinized and washed twice in PBS before adhesion and migration assays.Gelatinolytic Zymography—Analysis of MMP-9 activity was carried out in 7.5% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gels containing 0.1% gelatin (w/v) as described elsewhere (7Bauvois B. Dumont J. Mathiot C. Kolb J.P. Leukemia. 2002; 16: 791-798Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Samples were preincubated for 60 min with 0.5 mm amino-phenyl mercuric acid (Sigma), which activates the proform to the activated form.Enzyme-linked Immunoadsorbent Assays—The culture supernatants from COH cells were harvested under sterile conditions and frozen before MMP-9 and VEGF contents were determined using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits provided by R & D Systems. Controls included FCS-supplemented RPMI 1640 medium alone incubated under the same conditions.RNAi Experiments—The si-RNA sequence targeting human MMP-9 chosen in this study (from mRNA sequence; GenBank™ accession number NM-004994) corresponds to the coding region 377–403 relative to the first nucleotide of the start codon (target = 5′-AAC ATC ACC TAT TGG ATC CAA ACT AC-3′). Computer analysis using the software developed by Ambion Inc. confirmed this sequence to be a good target. si-RNAs were 21 nucleotides long with symmetric 2-nucleotide 3′ overhangs composed of 2′-deoxythymidine to enhance nuclease resistance. The si-RNAs were synthesized chemically and high pressure liquid chromatography purified (Genset, Paris, France). Sense si-RNA sequence was 5′-CAUCACCUAUUGGAUCCAAdTdT-3′. Antisense si-RNA was 5′-UUGGAUCCAAUAGGUGAUGdTdT-3′. For annealing of si-RNAs, mixture of complementary single stranded RNAs (at equimolar concentration) was incubated in annealing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, and 10 mm MgCl2) for 2 min at 95 °C followed by a slow cooling to room temperature (at least 25 °C) and then proceeded to storage temperature of 4 °C. Before transfection, cells cultured at 50% confluence in 6-well plates (10 cm2) were washed two times with OPTIMEM 1 (Invitrogen) without FCS and incubated in 1.5 ml of this medium without FCS for 1 h. Then, cells were transfected with MMP-9-RNA duplex formulated into Mirus TransIT-TKO transfection reagent (Mirus Corp., Interchim, France) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Unless otherwise described, transfection used 20 nm RNA duplex in 0.5 ml of transfection medium OPTIMEM 1 without FCS per 5 × 105 cells for 6 h and then the medium volume was adjusted to 1.5 ml per well with RPMI 2% FCS. Silencer™ negative control 1 si-RNA (Ambion Inc.) was used as negative control under similar conditions (20 nm).RT-PCR—RNA extraction from Ewing cells and subsequent cDNA synthesis were conducted as described previously (34Sanceau J. Hiscott J. Delattre O. Wietzerbin J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3372-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). MMP-9 cDNA (296 bp) was amplified using the sense primer 5′-GGA GAC CTG AGA ACC AAT CTC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-TCC AAT AGG TGA TGT TGT CGT-3′ according to published sequences (42Trocme C.

Chem. 1998; 273: 20677-20684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). β1-Integrin cDNA was amplified using the sense primer 5′-GTG AAT GGG AAC AAC GAG GTC-3′ and the antisense 5′-ACA ATA AAA CGA TAA ACG GAC-3′ according to published sequences (43De Arcangelis A. Lefebvre O. Mechine-Neuville A. Arnold C. Klein A. Remy L. Kedinger M. Simon-Assmann P. Int. J. Cancer. 2001; 94: 44-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). VEGF cDNA was amplified using the sense primer 5′-ACA TCT TCC AGG AG ACC CTG ATG AG-3′ and the antisense 5′-GCA TTC ACA TTT GTT GTG CTG T-3′ according to published sequences (44Westphal J.R. Van't Hullenaar R. Peek R. Willems R. Crickard K. Crickard U. Askaa J. Clemmensen I. Ruiter D. De Waal R. Int. J. Cancer. 2000; 86: 768-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). 18 S ribosomal RNA was used as an internal control (QuantumRNA™ 18 S Internal Standard; Ambion Inc). The PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis in 1.6% agarose gel containing 0.2 μg/ml ethidium bromide. The NIH Image 1.44 β11 software was used for the analysis.Flow Cytometry—Intact cells were immunostained as described previously (40Bauvois B. Rouillard D. Sanceau J. Wietzerbin J. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3912-3919PubMed Google Scholar). Clones used were β1 (4B4), α1 (HP-2B6), α2 (Gi9), α4 (HP2/1), α5 (SAM1), α6 (GoH3), ICAM-1 (84H10), VCAM-1 (BBIG-V1), NCAM (ERIC-1), CD44 (LAZ221ALL), α3 (P1B5), and E-cadherin (67A4). Analysis was performed in a FACS flow cytometer analyzer (BD Biosciences). Values are given as percentages of positive cells and relative intensity of fluorescence, which is an indication of the level of expression.Adhesion Assays—Twenty-four-well flat bottomed microtiter plates (Nunc) were coated overnight with fibronectin (Fn) or Laminin (Lm) or Collagen IV (Col) and blocked with BSA as described previously (40Bauvois B. Rouillard D. Sanceau J. Wietzerbin J. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3912-3919PubMed Google Scholar). Cells (4 × 105 cells per well in 1 ml of RPMI without FCS) were allowed to adhere to each substrate-coated well at 37 °C for 60 min. After PBS washing, adherent cells were trypsinized and quantitated using a cell Coulter Counter channelizer 256 (the diameters of living migrated cells ranging from 7 to 14 μm). Results from triplicates (mean ± S.D.) were expressed as relative cell adhesion (number of attached cells/total number of cells × 100). Specific adhesion to substrates was determined by subtracting the nonspecific attachment of cells to BSA-coated surfaces from cell attachment to coated surfaces. Morphology of attached cells was assessed by staining with the Hemacolor kit from Merck and subsequent light microscope examination.Migration Assays—The migration of COH cells was determined using the method described previously (45Ashida N. Arai H. Yamasaki M. Kita T. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 16555-16560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). After adjusting the cell density to 1 × 106 cells/ml in 0.1% BSA-RPMI, 100,000 cells in 100 μl were added to the top chamber of a 24-transwell apparatus (6.5-mm diameter, 8-μm pore size; Costar 3422, Corning Inc., Corning, NY) in the absence or presence of fibronectin (25 μg) in the lower chamber. After overnight incubation at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2, living cells (with diameters ranging from 7 to 14 μm) that passed through the membrane were collected from the lower well and counted in a cell Coulter Counter channelizer 256. Results from triplicate wells were expressed as mean ± S.D.Protein Analysis—Following cell (1 × 107 cells/ml) transfection for the indicated times, cells were washed twice with cold PBS. Total cellular extracts, nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts were prepared as described previously (36Sanceau J Boyd D.D. Seiki M. Bauvois B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35766-35775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Equivalent amounts of protein were separated on an 8 or 10% ProSieve® 50 gel (BioWhittaker Molecular Applications), transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell), and blotted as described previously (34Sanceau J. Hiscott J. Delattre O. Wietzerbin J. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 3372-3383Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, cells were lysed in 400 μl of lysis buffer containing 0.5% Brij35 (Sigma). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with mAbs prebound to protein G-Sepharose at 4 °C overnight. Immune complexes were washed four times and then resolved on 8% ProSieve® gels as described previously (40Bauvois B. Rouillard D. Sanceau J. Wietzerbin J. J. Immunol. 1992; 148: 3912-3919PubMed Google Scholar). For E-cadherin immunocomplexes, the β-catenin was first revealed followed by the total E-cadherin hybridization, and conversely for β-catenin complexes, E-cadherin was first revealed before total β-catenin hybridization.Fractionation Studies—Following cell transfection for the indicated times, cells were washed twice with cold PBS before resuspension in HEM buffer (2 mm MgCl2, 10 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 2 mm EDTA, 0.2 mm EGTA) (46Gilmore A.P. Metcalfe A. Romer L.H. Streuli C.H. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 431-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar) containing protease inhibitor mixture and phosphatase inhibitor mixture II. Following ice incubation for 10 min, cells were lysed in a Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation at 4 °C for 5 min at 500 × g to discard nucleus and subcellular organelles, the homogenates were centrifuged at 4 °C for 30 min at 45,000 × g. The cytosolic pool was collected, and the pellet (membrane-enriched fraction) was rapidly washed in HEM buffer and solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer (100 μl). Protein concentrations were determined using DC™ protein assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins from cytosolic and membrane-enriched pools were separated on an 8% ProSieve® 50 gel and immunoblotted as described above.Immunofluorescence Staining and Confocal Microscopy—Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and once with PBS containing 1% BSA before low speed cytocentrifugation to polylysine-treated slides (O. Kindler GmBH & Co., Freiburg, Germany). Cells were fixed in ice-cold methanol for 7 min and then washed twice with PBS. After 60 min of blocking in PBS containing 3% BSA at room temperature, cells were incubated in the same buffer with a polyclonal E-cadherin Ab (H108; 5 μg/ml), a monoclonal β-catenin Ab (clone 2A4H7; 1 μg/ml), or an isotype mIgG1 (1 μg/ml) for overnight at 4 °C. The preparations were washed three times for 15 min with PBS/0.05% Tween 20 and one wash with PBS, followed by an incubation for 90 min at room temperature with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse Ab or a TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit Abboth diluted 1/1000 in PBS/BSA. Preparations were then washed three times with PBS/0.05% Tween 20 and once in PBS. Slides were mounted in Vectashield (47Truchet S. Wietzerbin J. Debey P. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2001; 60: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Labeled samples were further analyzed by confocal microscopy on an Nikon microscope equipped with the Bio-Rad Laser-Sharp MRC-1024 confocal laser scanning software, using a Nikon Fluor ×100 oil-immersion objective and the 488- and 568-nm excitation wavelengths of the laser (47Truchet S. Wietzerbin J. Debey P. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2001; 60: 319-330Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The fluorescence of β-catenin and E-cadherin was analyzed concurrently in the same cell samples.RESULTSEfficient Extinction of MMP-9 Expression in COH Cells by RNAi Strategy—We used an RNAi method to target MMP-9 in the ES COH cell line, which constitutively expresses high levels of MMP-9. The constructs we designed encoded an RNA that targets the MMP-9 mRNA (Fig. 1A). The 21-nucleotide-long target sequence had no homology with other members of the MMP family. The ds-RNA and Silencer™ negative control si-RNA (snc) were each tested for their ability to suppress MMP-9 specifically. We first assessed whether RNAi was dose- and time-dependent. COH cells were transfected with 1–20 nm of the ds-RNA for up 3 days. By RT-PCR analysis, a MMP-9-dependent ds-RNA-mediated inhibition was observed in a dose- and time-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). The snc-RNA (20 nm) was incapable of inhibiting MMP-9 gene expression (Fig. 1B) even when transfected with a 10-fold-excess of the saturating ds-RNA concentration (200 nm) (data not shown). The time-course assay performed with 20 nm ds-RNA-transfected COH cells showed that induced MMP-9 silencing could be maintained for at least 3 days (corresponding to seven generation times) (Fig. 1C). Importantly, snc-RNA and ds-RNA transfection had no effect on the mRNA levels of two unrelated genes i.e. VEGF and integrin β1 (Fig. 1B).The RT-PCR results were confirmed by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay. COH snc-RNA-transfected cells cultured up to 3 days spontaneously released high amounts of MMP-9 into the culture conditioned medium whereas ds-RNA-transfected cells showed a marked time- and dose-dependent inhibition in MMP-9 protein levels (Fig. 1D, left panel). In accordance with RT-PCR data, levels of released VEGF by COH cells were not affected by ds-RNA transfection (Fig. 1D, right panel). Zymography analysis of the conditioned media from COH cells before and after snc-RNA treatment indicated the presence of a gelatinase activity at 92 kDa (Fig. 1E, compare lanes 4 and 6) consistent with the pattern of recombinant proMMP-9 (Fig. 1E, lane 1). In contrast, MMP-9 was barely evident in conditioned medium from ds-RNA cells (Fig. 1E, compare lane 8 with lanes 4 and 6) corroborating the undetectable MMP-9 transcript levels (Fig. 1C). Preincubation of COH supernatants with amino-phenyl mercuric acid, which activates the proform to the activated form, resulted in conversion of proMMP-9 to an active form of 82 kDa size (Fig. 1E, lanes 2, 5, and 7). Together, these findings indicate that RNAi efficiently and specifically inhibits endogenous MMP-9 gene expression in COH cells.MMP-9 Silencing Induces E-cadherin-mediated Cell-Cell Adhesion—RNAi led neither to cell necrosis (data not shown) nor to cell apoptosis as measured by means of fluorescence flow cytometry (Fig. 2A). Indeed, Apo 2.7 antigen, a mitochondrial membrane protein exposed on the surface of cells undergoing programmed cell death (48Zhang C. Ao Z. Seth A. Schlossman S. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 3980-3987PubMed Google Scholar), was expressed on less than 10% of snc-RNA cells. The levels of Apo 2.7 on ds-RNA cells remained close to that of snc-RNA c"
https://openalex.org/W1997238313,"4-O-Sulfation of GalNAc is a high frequency modification of chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate (DS), and three major GalNAc 4-O-sulfotransferases including dermatan 4-O-sulfotransferase-1 (D4ST-1) and chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferases-1 and -2 (C4ST-1 and -2) have been identified. 4-O-Sulfation of GalNAc during DS biosynthesis had long been postulated to be a prerequisite for iduronic acid (IdoUA) formation by C5-epimerization of GlcUA. This hypothesis has recently been argued based on enzymological studies using microsomes that C5-epimerization precedes 4-O-sulfation, which was further supported by the specificity of the cloned D4ST-1 with predominant preference for IdoUA-GalNAc flanked by GlcUA-GalNAc over IdoUA-GalNAc flanked by IdoUA-GalNAc in exhaustively desulfated dermatan. Whereas the counterproposal explains the initial reactions, apparently it cannot rationalize the synthetic mechanism of IdoUA-GalNAc(4-O-sulfate)-rich clusters typical of mature DS chains. In this study, we examined detailed specificities of the three recombinant human 4-O-sulfotransferases using partially desulfated DS as an acceptor. Enzymatic analysis of the transferase reaction products showed that D4ST-1 far more efficiently transferred sulfate to GalNAc residues in -IdoUA-Gal-NAc-IdoUA-than in -GlcUA-GalNAc-GlcUA-sequences. In contrast, C4ST-1 showed the opposite preference, and C4ST-2 used GalNAc residues in both sequences to comparable degrees, being consistent with its phylogenetic relations to D4ST-1 and C4ST-1. Structural analysis of the oligosaccharides, which were isolated after chondroitinase AC-I digestion of the 35S-labeled transferase reaction products, revealed for the first time that D4ST-1, as compared with C4ST-1 and C4ST-2, most efficiently utilized GalNAc residues located not only in the sequence -IdoUA-GalNAc-IdoUA- but also in -GlcUA-Gal-NAc-IdoUA- and -IdoUA-GalNAc-GlcUA-. The isolated oligosaccharide structures also suggest that 4-O-sulfation promotes subsequent 4-O-sulfation of GalNAc in the neighboring disaccharide unit."
https://openalex.org/W2147438583,"Signals involved in protection against apoptosis by herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) were investigated. Using U937 monocytoid cells as an experimental model, we have demonstrated that HSV-1 rendered these cells resistant to Fas-induced apoptosis promptly after infection. UV-inactivated virus as well as the envelope glycoprotein D (gD) of HSV-1, by itself, exerted a protective effect on Fas-induced apoptosis. NF-κB was activated by gD, and protection against Fas-mediated apoptosis by gD was abolished in cells stably transfected with a dominant negative mutant I-κBα, indicating that NF-κB activation plays a role in the antiapoptotic activity of gD in our experimental model. Moreover, NF-κB-dependent protection against Fas-mediated apoptosis was associated with decreased levels of caspase-8 activity and with the up-regulation of intracellular antiapoptotic proteins.

Chem. 1997; 272: 14029-14032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Recent results have shown that gD delivered in trans blocks the apoptotic cascade triggered by HSV-1 mutants lacking the gene encoding gD in SK-N-SH cells (29Zhou G. Galvan V. Campadelli-Fiume G. Roizman B. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 11782-11791Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar, 30Zhou G. Roizman B. J. Virol. 2001; 75: 6166-6172Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Cellular signals involved in the antiapoptotic action exerted by HSV-1-gD remain to be elucidated. Interestingly, overexpression of the gD receptor HveA has been shown to cause activation of the transcription factor, NF-κB (28Marsters S.A. Ayres T.M. Skubatch M. Gray C.L. Rothe M. Ashkenazi A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14029-14032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Furthermore, it has been reported that engagement with HveA receptor of its natural ligand, LIGHT, can stimulate the activation of NF-κB in different cellular systems (31Tamada K. Shimozaki K. Chapoval A.I. Zhai Y. Su J. Chen S. Hsieh S. Nagata S. Ni J. Chen L. J. Immunol. 2000; 164: 4105-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 32Hikichi Y. Matsui H. Tsuji I. Nishi K. Yamada T. Shintani Y. Onda H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 289: 670-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). This suggests the possibility that also engagement of gD with HveA could lead to NF-κB activation. The transcription factor NF-κB consists of a homodimeric or heterodimeric complex of two subunits belonging to the highly conserved family of Rel-related proteins (33Perkins N.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 434-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). The most important complex is that formed by two proteins with molecular masses of 50 kDa (p50) and 65 kDa (p65), respectively. This heterodimer is present in the cytoplasm of most cell types as an inactive form due to the inhibitory action of an associated protein, inhibitory κB (IκB). Activation of NF-κB, in response to a variety of stimuli, including viral infections, involves phosphorylation and degradation of IκB (34Brown K. Gerstberger S. Carlson L. Franzoso G. Siebenlist U. Science. 1995; 267: 1485-1488Crossref PubMed Scopus (1314) Google Scholar) and can be considered one of the first lines of defense against infections and cellular stress (33Perkins N.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 434-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar, 35Mercurio F.M. Manning A.M. Curr. Opin.

In addition, it has been shown that NF-κB can act as an important regulator of apoptosis, through the induction of already identified or unidentified apoptosis-controlling genes, which exert either an inducing or a preventing action on cell death (37Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2933) Google Scholar, 38Van Antwerp D.J. Martin S.J. Kafri T. Green D.R. Verma I.M.

Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6910-6924Crossref PubMed Scopus (1075) Google Scholar). In fact, it has recently been demonstrated that NF-κB signaling induces protection from anti-Fas-mediated apoptosis (41Rivera-Walsh I. Cvijic M.E. Xiao G. Sun S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25222-25230Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Interestingly, it has been shown that HSV-1 infection activates NF-κB (42Patel A. Hanson J. McLean T.I. Olgiate J. Hilton M. Miller W.E. Bachenheimer S.L. Virology. 1998; 247: 212-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 43Rong B.L. Libermann T.A. Kogawa K. Ghosh S. Cao L.X. PavanLangston D. Dunkel E.C. Virology. 1992; 189: 750-756Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Particularly, it has been recently demonstrated that HSV-1 induces persistent activation of NF-κB by activating the IκB kinase in the early phase of infection of HEp-2 permissive cells (44Amici C. Belardo G. Rossi A. Santoro M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 28759-28766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). However, little information is available at the molecular level on mechanisms participating in this activation. In this paper, we have addressed the issue of viral and cellular signals involved in protection against Fas death receptor-mediated apoptosis by HSV-1, using U937 monocytoid cells as an experimental model. We found that gD of HSV-1 and NF-κB signaling are viral and cellular requirements, respectively, which are sufficient for protecting U937 cells against Fasinduced apoptosis. Cells and Virus—U937 cells, originally obtained from the Istituto Zooprofilattico (Brescia, Italy), were propagated in RPMI 1640 (HyClone Europe, Cramlington, UK) supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% FCS (HyClone Europe). An “F” strain of HSV-1, originally obtained from ATCC was used in these experiments. Virus stocks were produced on Vero cells propagated in minimal essential medium (HyClone Europe), containing 6% FCS, at 37 °CinaCO2 incubator. Virus stocks, collected and stored in aliquots at -80 °C, gave a titer of ∼1 × 108 pfu/ml in Vero cells. In experiments requiring inactivated virus, virus suspension was placed in Petri dishes and exposed, for 150 s, to UV light at an intensity of 30 watts from a germicidal lamp situated 10 cm above the sample. UV-inactivated HSV-1 was used at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50 pfu/cell. In cocultivation experiments, 1 × 106 U937 cells were cocultured with gD-transfected or control adherent cells at ∼80% confluence, in 6-well plates. After 24 h, nonadherent U937 cells were collected from the supernatants and centrifuged at 800 × g. The pellets were suspended at 1 × 106 cell/ml in fresh medium containing 1% FCS, and apoptosis was induced with anti-human Fas. In other experiments, conditioned medium from gD-transfected or control adherent cells, routinely maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% FCS, was collected 18 h after replacement of culture medium 1% FCS RPMI 1640 and centrifuged at 800 × g to remove cellular debris. U937 cells were then suspended at 1 × 106 cell/ml in conditioned medium before inducing and testing apoptosis. Experimental Infections—Approximately 6 × 104 U937 cells in 96well plates were exposed to virus inoculum (HSV-1 or UV-inactivated HSV-1), 24 h after cultures had been split, at 4 °C for either 60 or 90 min. Subsequently, virus inoculum was replaced by fresh growth medium (RPMI 1640 containing 1% FCS), and the infected and control cells were then shifted to 37 °C. Antibodies and Reagents—Anti-gD monoclonal antibody affinity-purified recombinant forms of gD, gD-1(306t), or gD-1(Δ290–299t) were kindly provided by Dr. Gerard Cohen and Dr. Roselyn Eisenberg (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) (45Nicola A.V. Willis S.H. Naidoo N.N. Eisenberg R.J. Cohen G.H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3815-3822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-human XIAP rabbit polyclonal antibody and anti-human survivin were purchased from R&D Systems, Inc. (Minneapolis, MN). Fluorescein-conjugated antihuman Fas, clone DX2, was purchased from BD PharMingen (San Diego, CA). Anti-IκBα rabbit polyclonal antibody sc-371, which recognizes an epitope mapping at the carboxyl terminus of human IκBα identical to the corresponding mouse sequence, and anti-human c-IAP2 rabbit polyclonal antibody H-85 were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-human FLIP rabbit polyclonal antibody was purchased from Ψ ProSci Inc. (Poway, CA). Human recombinant tumor necrosis factor-α was purchased from ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). Anti-human Fas antibody, clone CH11, was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). To evaluate Fas-induced apoptosis, CH11 was generally added at 200 ng/ml to the infected or uninfected cells. Soluble gD1(306t) or gD1(Δ290–299t), at 1 μg/ml, was added to 6 × 104 U937 cells in 96-well plates that were maintained at 4 °C for 1 h prior to the addition of anti-human Fas. Cultures were incubated for a further 1 h at 4 °C and then shifted to 37 °C. Evaluation of Apoptosis—Apoptosis was evaluated using various techniques. Morphological analysis of the cells was performed following staining with acridine orange as previously described (11Mastino A. Sciortino M.T. Medici M.A. Perri D. Ammendolia M.G. Grelli S. Amici C. Pernice A. Guglielmino S. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, over 600 cells, including those showing typical apoptotic characteristics, were counted using a fluorescence microscope. The identification of apoptotic cells was based on the presence of uniformly stained nuclei showing chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation. Flow cytometry analysis of isolated nuclei, following staining with propidium iodide, was performed on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson) as described (46Matteucci C. Grelli S. De Smaele E. Fontana C. Mastino A. Cytometry. 1999; 35: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Analysis of DNA fragmentation at the single cell level was carried out using the TUNEL technique, as described (11Mastino A. Sciortino M.T. Medici M.A. Perri D. Ammendolia M.G. Grelli S. Amici C. Pernice A. Guglielmino S. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared from either untreated cells or cells treated with supernatants from gD transfectants or soluble forms of gD. Briefly, cells were resuspended in buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2,10mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), incubated on ice for 15 min, and then homogenized by 15 passages through a 25gauge needle. The nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and resuspended in buffer B (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl2, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 5 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 mm spermidine, and 5 μg/ml aprotinin). After 15 min of incubation on ice, the nuclear extracts were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 2 min. Nuclear extracts (5 μg of protein) were subjected to EMSA using a 32P-labeled κB DNA probe (47Rossi A. Elia G. Santoro M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 746-750Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). The resulting DNA-protein complex was analyzed by nondenaturating 4% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Quantitative evaluation of NF-κB-κB complex formation was determined by analysis using a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Specificity of the protein-DNA complex was verified by immunoreactivity with polyclonal antibodies to p65 (Rel A) and, in competition experiments, with an excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide. Construction of Stable Transfectants Expressing Constitutively HSV1-gD and Mutant Murine IκBa—HSV-1-gD open reading frame, containing 14 bp upstream of the AUG codon and 32 bp downstream of the STOP codon, was PCR-amplified from HSV-1 DNA and cloned into the pRPneoCMV vector (48Sabbioni S. Negrini M. Rimessi P. Manservigi R. Barbanti-Brodano G. Arch. Virol. 1995; 140: 335-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar); the resulting plasmid was transfected into I143tk- cells. Transfected cells were grown under G418 (Invitrogen) selection, distributed into 24-well plates, and screened by immunofluorescence with HSV-1-gD-specific antibodies. Cells derived from different positive wells were mixed and amplified under G418 to obtain stable transfectants named Ig6D. Dominant negative murine IκBα, mutated at serines 32, 36, 283, 288, 293 and at threonines 291 and 296, all substituted by alanine, was generated by polymerase chain reactionbased site-directed mutagenesis and was kindly provided by Dr. Inder M. Verma (The Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA) (49Pando M.P. Verma I.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 21278-21286Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The gene was contained in a pCMX vector and was subcloned in a pcDNA 3.1 Neo vector (Invitrogen). The subcloning was done using the EcoRI sites. The construct was sequenced, and the mutations were verified. To obtain stable expression of mutant mouse IκBα (mIκBα) in the U937 cell line, 2 × 106 cells were plated in 60-mm dishes and grown in RPMI medium with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. The next day, the cells were harvested, washed in sterile phosphate-buffered saline without calcium and magnesium and resuspended in fresh medium without serum and antibiotics. A volume of 12 μl of FuGene™ 6 transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) was added to 188 μl of RPMI medium with neither serum nor antibiotics and then mixed with 3 μg of linearized pcDNA-mIκBα or pcDNA3.1(+) constructs, respectively. The DNA mixture was left under the hood at room temperature for 15 min and then added dropwise to each tissue culture dish. Mock-transfected cells were also included as a control. After 48 h, the cells were harvested, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in complete RPMI medium containing 400 μg/ml G418, and seeded into 24-well plates at a concentration of 2 × 105 cells/well. G418 was replaced every 3 days for 3 weeks. Resistant cells deriving from three positive wells were mixed and amplified, maintaining constant G418 concentration and then tested for pcDNA-mIκBα or pcDNA3.1(+) expression. Western Blot Analysis and Caspase-8 Activity Assay—A quantity of 5 × 106 cells was solubilized at 4 °C in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, 1% Triton-X, NaCl 150 mm, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Nonidet P-40, and, freshly added, 1 mm Na3VO4,20mm Na3F completed with protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and centrifuged at 10,000 × g. An aliquot of the supernatant was saved for determination of protein concentration. The rest was boiled in SDS sample buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 2% SDS, 0.1% bromphenol blue, 10% glycerol), and then 50 μg of proteins were run on a 10% (mIκBα) or 12.5% (c-IAP2, FLIP, XIAP, and survivin) SDS-polyacrylamide gel. For detection of mIκBα, gels were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), whereas for detection of c-IAP2, FLIP, XIAP, and survivin, gels were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The membranes were successively stained with 0.2% Ponceau red. After blocking the membrane in 10% nonfat dry milk and 3% bovine serum albumin in TTBS (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.9% NaCl, 0.03% Tween 20), the blot was incubated overnight at 4 °C with appropriate polyclonal antibodies against different proteins. The blot was then washed and incubated with a peroxidase-conjugated goat antirabbit IgG (Calbiochem). Antibody binding was detected by chemoluminescence staining using the ECL detection kit (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). For presentation, immunoblots were digitally scanned at 600 dpi using Adobe Photoshop 5.0. Caspase-8 activity was assayed using the ApoAlert colorimetric kit (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical Analysis—Data analysis was performed using the SPSS statistical software system (version 10.0 for Windows; Chicago, IL). Comparisons of means were carried out using the Student's t test for independent or paired samples and Tukey's honestly significance test, as a multiple comparison and range test, where appropriate. HSV-1 Renders U937 Cells Resistant to Fas-induced Apoptosis as an Early Event following Infection—We have previously demonstrated that U937 cells are sensitive to apoptosis induced by wild type HSV-1 (11Mastino A. Sciortino M.T. Medici M.A. Perri D. Ammendolia M.G. Grelli S. Amici C. Pernice A. Guglielmino S. Cell Death Differ. 1997; 4: 629-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Here we show the kinetics of induction of apoptosis by HSV-1 in this cell line (Fig. 1A , bars), paralleled with the kinetics of virus yield released from infected cells in the same representative experiment (Fig. 1A , lines). Apoptosis was detected at remarkable levels only as a late event after infection, whereas it was practically absent during the early phase. Moreover, increasing values of virus yield confirmed that infection by HSV-1 in U937 monocytoid cells was a true productive one. Thus, we attempted to verify whether HSV-1 was able to protect against Fas-induced apoptosis early after infection in our experimental model. To this purpose, target cells were exposed to virus inoculum at an MOI of 50 pfu/cell, and an agonist anti-Fas antibody was added to the cells immediately after incubation with virus inoculum (0 h) and at 1.5, 3, and 6 h following the end of exposure to the virus. Apoptosis was detected in all cultures 20 h after infection. Results demonstrated that infection with HSV-1 inhibited Fas-mediated apoptosis in a highly significant way (p < 0,01) in all experimental conditions tested (Fig. 1B). Treatment with UV of HSV-1 Does Not Abrogate Inhibition of Fas-induced Apoptosis in U937 Cells—In order to understand whether completion of the replicative cycle of HSV-1 was a necessary step in the inhibition of Fas-induced apoptosis by the virus, we repeated our experiments using virus inocula inactivated by UV treatment. The cells were exposed for 1 h to UV-inactivated HSV-1 or, as a control, to UV-treated medium, and anti-Fas antibody was added at various times following the end of exposure. Results demonstrate that UV-inactivated HSV-1 retained its ability to inhibit apoptosis, detected 20 h after the end of exposure to UV-inactivated inoculum, despite the fact that it had lost its capability to replicate, in two independent experiments performed (Table I). From these series of experiments, we concluded that structural components of HSV-1 virions were able to exert an inhibitory action on Fas-mediated apoptosis in U937 cells.Table IEffect of exposure to UV-inactivated HSV-1 on anti-Fas-induced apoptosis in U937 cellsTime of anti-Fas addition (h after exposure)aU937 cells were exposed for 1 h to control UV-treated medium or to UV-inactivated HSV-1, and anti-Fas antibody was added at the times indicated following the end of exposure. Values of apoptosis in cells treated with UV-inactivated HSV-1 alone are also reported. Apoptosis was detected in all samples 20 h after the end of exposure to UV-inactivated inocula% ApoptosisControl + anti-FasUV-inactivated HSV-1 + anti-FasUV-inactivated HSV-1h%%%Experiment 1078.554.14.2474.728.9862.440.7Experiment 2068.445.23.5471.233.3862.830.6a U937 cells were exposed for 1 h to control UV-treated medium or to UV-inactivated HSV-1, and anti-Fas antibody was added at the times indicated following the end of exposure.

Apoptosis was detected in all samples 20 h after the end of exposure to UV-inactivated inocula Open table in a new tab Cocultivation of U937 Cells with gD Stable Transfectants or Exposure to Their Supernatants Inhibits Fas-induced Apoptosis—In order to verify whether gD, which is present in the virion envelope of HSV-1, could be responsible for the above described phenomena, we cocultured nonadherent U937 cells with adherent stable transfectants expressing gD at surface level for 24 h. At the end of coculture, nonadherent cells were harvested and centrifuged. Pellets were then suspended in fresh medium before inducing and testing, 18 h later, Fasmediated apoptosis. Expression of gD was verified, prior to experiments, by immunofluorescence. As controls, U937 cells were either left alone or cocultured with nontransfected I143tk- cells, before anti-Fas addition. Exposure to gD-expressing transfectants caused a highly significant inhibition of Fas-mediated apoptosis in U937 cells, in comparison with results obtained in noncocultured cells (p = 0.001) or in cells cocultured with control, non-gD-expressing cells (p = 0.002; Fig. 2). Moreover, similar results were obtained when U937 cells were exposed to supernatants collected from gD-expressing transfectants, which were found to contain detectable amounts of gD when tested by immunoassay (data not shown). In this case, Fas-mediated apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry analysis of hypodiploid nuclei following staining with propidium iodide. The percentage of hypodiploid nuclei from apoptotic cells was clearly inhibited by preincubation of U937 cells with supernatants collected from gD-expressing transfectants (35%, SUP/gD+, Fig. 3) compared with control cells cultured with medium alone (68%, CTR, Fig. 3) or with cells preincubated with supernatants from non-gD-expressing cultures (65%, SUP/gD-, Fig. 3). Moreover, no significant difference in the expression of surface Fas, between cells exposed to control treatments and cells exposed to gD transfectants or their supernatants, was found by flow cytometry analysis (data not shown).Fig. 3Effects of incubation with supernatants derived from gD-expressing transfectants on Fas-induced apoptosis in U937. U937 cells were cultured for 24 h in the presence of conditioned medium from control, non-gD-expressing, I143tk- cells (SUP/gD-) or in the presence of conditioned medium from Ig6D, gD-expressing tranfectants (SUP/gD+). Apoptosis was detected after a further 18-h incubation in the presence of anti-Fas (100 ng/ml) in cells preincubated with conditioned medium and in untreated, control cells (CTR), by flow cytometry analysis of hypodiploid nuclei isolated and stained with a hypotonic solution containing detergent and propidium iodide. The dashed lines indicate the boundaries among the peaks of diploid nuclei (right), hypodiploid nuclei (central), and presumably debris (left), which were arbitrarily set on untreated samples and maintained for all other samples. The numbers in the cytograms represent the percentages of hypodiploid, apoptotic nuclei, based on the total number of nuclei from which debris was excluded. Similar results were obtained in four other independent experiments in which apoptosis was evaluated using fluorescence microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Treatment of U937 Cells with Soluble Forms of gD Protects against Fas-induced Apoptosis—In order to confirm that exposure to gD of HSV-1 was sufficient by itself to protect against Fas-mediated apoptosis, we performed a series of experiments using soluble forms of r"

https://openalex.org/W1989820489,"Recently, the control of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3)-dependant signaling by phosphatases has emerged, but there is a shortage of information on intranuclear PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 phosphatases. Therefore, we investigated the dephosphorylation of [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 specifically labeled on the D-3 position of the inositol ring in membrane-free nuclei isolated from pig aorta vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). In vitro PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 phosphatase assays revealed the production of both [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2 and inorganic phosphate, demonstrating the presence of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 5- and 3-phosphatase activities inside the VSMC nucleus, respectively. Both activities presented the same potency in cellular lysates, whereas the nuclear PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase activity appeared to be the most efficient. Immunoblot experiments showed for the first time the expression of the 5-phosphatase SHIP-2 (src homology 2 domain-containing inositol phosphatase) as well as the 3-phosphatase PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10) in VSMC nuclei. In addition, immunoprecipitations from nuclear fractions indicated a [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 dephosphorylation by both SHIP-2 and PTEN. Moreover, confocal microscopy analyses demonstrated that SHIP-2 but not PTEN colocalized with a speckle-specific component, the SC35 splicing factor. These results suggest that SHIP-2 may be the primary enzyme for metabolizing PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 into PtdIns(3,4)P2 within the nucleus, thus producing another second messenger, whereas PTEN could down-regulate nuclear phosphoinositide 3-kinase signaling. Finally, intranuclear PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 phosphatases might be involved in the control of VSMC proliferation and the pathogenesis of vascular proliferative disorders.

Med. 1999; 340: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (18955) Google Scholar). We showed previously that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is essential for the VSMC cycle (3Bacqueville D. Casagrande F. Perret B. Chap H. Darbon J.M. Breton-Douillon M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 630-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), and this enzyme was implicated recently in restenosis (4Braun-Dullaeus R.C. Mann M.J. Seay U. Zhang L. von Der Leyen H.E.

PI3Ks make up a large family of lipid kinases, but class I PI3Ks are the most well known (5Fruman D.A. Meyers R.E. Cantley L.C. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 481-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar, 6Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev.

They convey both growth and survival signals from activated receptors; class IA PI3K (α, β, and δ) is regulated by receptors with intrinsic or associated-tyrosine kinase activity, whereas the class IB or PI3Kγ is activated by G protein-coupled receptors. PI3Ks catalyze phosphorylation of phosphoinositides (PIs) at the D-3 position of the inositol ring to generate two potent second messengers, phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4)P2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P3), which regulate downstream effectors such as the serine/threonine protein kinases PKB (also called Akt) and PKCζ, and control many cellular responses involved in neointimal hyperplasia and restenosis, including cell proliferation, migration, and survival (8Katso R.

Because 3-phosphoinositides (3-PIs) are not hydrolyzed by any known phospholipase C, a counter-regulation by phosphatases has emerged as a crucial process to control PtdIns(3,4,5)P3dependent signaling. Indeed, PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is inactivated both in vitro and in vivo by the removal of either the 3- or 5-position phosphate by specific phosphatases (6Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K. Timms J. Katso R. Driscoll P.C. Woscholski R. Parker P.J. Waterfield M.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 535-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1347) Google Scholar). First, the PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) tumor suppressor gene encodes a dual-specificity protein phosphatase and a lipid phosphatase. PTEN preferentially dephosphorylates the D-3 position of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 but is also active on PtdIns(3,4)P2, thus antagonizing PI3K signaling pathways (6Vanhaesebroeck B. Leevers S.J. Ahmadi K.

Leslie N.R. Pass I. MacPhee C. Patel L. Gray A. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 846-851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN was correlated to its anti-oncogenic effects (11Myers M.P. Pass I. Batty I.H. Van der Kaay J. Stolarov J.P. Hemmings B.A. Wigler M.H. Downes C.P.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13513-13518Crossref PubMed Scopus (986) Google Scholar). In addition, PTEN overexpression was shown recently to inhibit survival and hypertrophy of cardiomyocytes (12Schwartzbauer G. Robbins J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35786-35793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), angiogenic responses (13Huang J. Kontos C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10760-10766Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), and rabbit VSMC proliferation, migration, and survival (14Huang J. Kontos C.D. Nakanishi H. Exton J.H. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2002; 22: 745-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Second, the src homology 2 domain-containing inositol phosphatases or SHIP proteins are 5-phosphatases that dephosphorylate PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 into PtdIns(3,4)P2. Two closely related isoforms of SHIP are currently known; SHIP-1 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells (15Damen J.E. Liu L. Rosten P. Humphries R.K. Jefferson A.B. Majerus P.W. Krystal G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1689-1693Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar), whereas SHIP-2 is more ubiquitous (16Pesesse X. Deleu S. De Smedt F. Drayer L. Erneux C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 239: 697-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Moreover, SHIP-2 overexpression induces arrest in G1 associated with the stabilization of the cell cycle inhibitor p27Kip in glioblastoma cells (17Taylor V. Wong M. Brandts C. Reilly L. Dean N.M. Cowsert L.M. Moodie S. Stokoe D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6860-6871Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), as observed previously for PTEN (18Li D.M. Sun H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15406-15411Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Thus, the production of PtdIns(3,4)P2 from PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 by SHIP proteins may convert one signal to another, whereas PTEN could mediate inactivation of both PtdIns(3,4)P2 and PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 signals. Most research on PI3K-dependent transduction pathways focused on the plasma membrane, but 3-PIs and their biosynthetic machinery are also present in the nucleus, suggesting that they could be major players in nuclear signaling. Indeed, reports highlighted expression of an active class IA PI3K in the nucleus of different cell types, such as neurons, hepatocytes, and osteosarcoma cells (19Martelli A.M. Bortul R. Tabellini G. Aluigi M. Peruzzi D. Bareggi R. Narducci P. Cocco L. FEBS Lett. 2001; 505: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar, 20Neri L.M. Borgatti P. Capitani S. Martelli A.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1584: 73-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), and epitope-tagged PI3Kγ translocation to the nucleus after serum stimulation in HepG2 cells (21Metjian A. Roll R.L. Ma A.D. Abrams C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27943-27947Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). We also characterized an endogenous G protein-activated PI3K from membrane-free VSMC nuclei (22Bacqueville D. Deleris P. Mendre C. Pieraggi M.T. Chap H. Guillon G. Perret B. Breton-Douillon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22170-22176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This PI3Kγ-related enzyme specifically generated PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 from a pre-existing nuclear pool of PtdIns(4,5)P2. Interestingly, Boronenkov et al. (23Boronenkov I.V. Loijens J.C. Umeda M. Anderson R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 3547-3560Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) demonstrated that PtdIns(4,5)P2 is spatially located in speckles, which are nuclear structures involved in pre-mRNA processing in mammalian cells. To date, the mechanisms controlling the level of nuclear PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 are not understood, and there is a lack of knowledge about nuclear PtdIns(3,4,5)P3-phosphatases. Immunohistochemical studies showed that PTEN is expressed in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (24Gimm O. Perren A. Weng L.P. Marsh D.J. Yeh J.J. Ziebold U. Gil E. Hinze R. Delbridge L. Lees J.A.

Therefore, we investigated 3-PI phosphatase activity in membrane-free nuclei isolated from pig aorta VSMCs. Our data provide the first evidence for the presence of two active 3-PI phosphatases inside the cell nucleus. Moreover, the activities of these 5- and 3-phosphatases correlate with the expression of active SHIP-2 and PTEN in the nuclear compartment, respectively, and SHIP-2 seems to be the primary enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 in VSMC nuclei. Finally, our results reveal that SHIP-2, but not PTEN, concentrates in nuclear speckles, suggesting that SHIP-2 may be involved in pre-mRNA processing. Chemicals and Antibodies—All culture reagents were obtained from Invitrogen. [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Perkin Elmer Corp. Antibodies specific for PTEN (sc-7974 and sc-9145), SHIP-1 (sc-1964), SHIP-2 (sc-14502 and sc-14504), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-goat antibody, and blocking peptide (sc-14502P) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

An ECL system was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. Phopshatidylinositol-4-monophosphate (PtdIns(4)P), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns(4,5)P2), phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylserine were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Cell Culture and Isolation of VSMC Nuclei—VSMCs were prepared from the thoracic aortas of pigs 6 weeks of age using the explant technique and cultured as described previously (27Breton M. Berrou E. Brahimi-Horn M.C. Deudon E. Picard J. Exp. Cell Res. 1986; 166: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). For all experiments, VSMCs were used from the second to the fifth passage. VSMCs were arrested in the G0-G1 phase by complete serum starvation and then induced to progress through the cell cycle by adding 10% fetal calf serum as described previously (3Bacqueville D. Casagrande F. Perret B. Chap H. Darbon J.M. Breton-Douillon M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 630-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Highly purified VSMC nuclei, stripped of their nuclear envelopes, were obtained as described previously (22Bacqueville D. Deleris P. Mendre C. Pieraggi M.T. Chap H. Guillon G. Perret B. Breton-Douillon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22170-22176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, growing VSMCs or VSMCs progressing through the cell cycle were washed twice with ice-cold calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline and once with a hypotonic buffer. VSMCs were then lysed at 4 °C in the hypotonic buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40 and 1% deoxycholic acid at 4 °C and were sheared by three passages through a 25-gauge needle. The cell lysate was layered over a 0.3 m/2 m sucrose discontinuous gradient and was centrifuged at 500 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Membrane-depleted nuclei were recovered at the interface 0.3 m/2 m sucrose, washed once with the phosphatase assay buffer, and disrupted by sonication (10 kHz for 3 s) using an ultrasonic cell disrupter (Brandson Sonifier 250). An average of 0.5 × 106 nuclei were obtained from 1 × 106 cells (1 × 106 cells and 1 × 106 nuclei contained 300 and 30 μg of proteins, respectively). Flow Cytometry Analysis—Nuclei from VSMCs progressing through the cell cycle were fixed overnight with 70% ethanol at 4 °C. Before analysis, the fixed nuclei were stained with a propidium iodide solution (100 mg/ml) as described previously (3Bacqueville D. Casagrande F. Perret B. Chap H. Darbon J.M. Breton-Douillon M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 244: 630-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Nuclei were then analyzed for DNA content by using a standard method on a Coulter Elite (Coulter). Immunoblotting and Immunoprecipitation—Proteins from whole cells or purified nuclei were separated by SDS-PAGE using 5 or 9% polyacrylamide gels, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane (Schleicher and Schuell), and immunoblotted as described previously (28Payrastre B. Gironcel D. Plantavid M. Mauco G. Breton M. Chap H. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the appropriate primary antibody, polyclonal (sc-9145) or monoclonal (sc-7974) anti-PTEN (1:1200 and 1:100 respectively), anti-SHIP-1 (1:200), or anti-SHIP-2 (sc-14502, 1:200), overnight at 4 °C. Neutralization of anti-SHIP-2 antibody was performed by pre-incubation with a 5-fold excess of blocking peptide (sc-14502P) 2 h at room temperature. After incubation for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (anti-rabbit, 1:5000; anti-mouse, 1:5000; anti-goat, 1:2000), immunoreactive proteins were visualized with ECL reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions. The signals from individual protein bands were quantified by densitometric scans with ImageQuant 1.2 software (Molecular Dynamics). The contents of the detected protein in nuclei were then calculated relative to the amount of the total cellular protein. For immunoprecipitation, 107 cells or 1.5 × 107 nuclei washed previously in ice-cold calcium- and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.3), 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, 0.5% deoxycholic acid, 1% Nonidet P-40, and 10 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and benzamidine). After sonication (30 kHz, 5 s), samples were spun at 10,000 × g for 5 min, and supernatants were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 4 μg of anti-PTEN (sc-9145 or sc-7974) or anti-SHIP-2 (sc-14504) antibodies, followed by addition of 25 μl of agarose-conjugated protein A/G for 1 h. Then, the immunocomplexes were washed once with lysis buffer and twice with phosphatase buffer and finally resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer or in phosphatase assay buffer. Immunocytochemistry—Growing VSMCs were cultured at low confluence on glass coverslips, with or without 10 μg/ml of α-amanitin, for 4 h, washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 2 min. After three washes in phosphate-buffered saline, cells were blocked with 0.2% gelatin for 30 min, followed by the incubation with the relevant primary antibody: anti-PTEN (sc-9145, 1:10), anti-SHIP-2 (sc-14502, 1:20), or anti-SC35 (1:1000) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing, cells were stained 1 h at room temperature with the corresponding secondary antibody: FITC-conjugated anti-goat (1:20) or anti-mouse (1:200), TRITC-conjugated anti-rabbit (1:200) or TRITC-conjugated anti-mouse (1:200). Finally, cells were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc.) and examined by confocal scanning laser immunofluorescence microscopy using a LSM510 ZEISS microscope. 3-Phosphoinositide Phosphatase Assays—[32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2 and [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 labeled at the D-3 position of the inositol ring were prepared. First, class IA PI3K was immunoprecipitated from 107 growing VSMCs with anti-p85α antibody as described previously (29Guinebault C. Payrastre B. Racaud-Sultan C. Mazarguil H. Breton M. Mauco G. Plantavid M. Chap H. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 831-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Second, 100 μm PtdIns(4)P or PtdIns(4,5)P2 was added to 200 μm phosphatidylserine, dried under nitrogen, resuspended in 100 μl of 50 mm Tris (pH 7.3), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm EDTA, 2 mm Na3VO4, and 10 μg/ml each aprotinin, leupeptin, and benzamidine, and sonicated (40 kHz, 2 × 10 s). Then, immunopurified PI3K was added to PtdIns(4)P/phosphatidylserine or PtdIns(4,5)P2/phosphatidylserine vesicles and incubated in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2, 2.5 μm ATP, and 50 μCi [γ-32P]ATP in a final volume of 100 μl. Reactions were stopped by addition of 2 ml of chloroform:methanol:2 n HCl:200 mm EDTA (1:1:0.5:0.5, v/v/v/v). Lipids were immediately extracted and separated on oxalate-coated TLC plates (Silica Gel 60, Merck) as described previously (30Sultan C. Breton M. Mauco G. Grondin P. Plantavid M. Chap H. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). [32P]PI was visualized with a PhosphorImager (445 SI Molecular Dynamics), and the spots corresponding to [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2 or [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 were scrapped, eluted in chloroform:methanol:2 n HCl:H2O (1:1:0.5:0.5, v/v/v/v), and evaporated under nitrogen. 3-PI phosphatase assays were then performed for up to 60 min at 37 °C by incubating 105 dpm of [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3/phosphatidylcholine or [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2/phosphatidylcholine vesicles with either whole-cell lysates or nuclear extracts (107 cells or 1.5 × 107 nuclei, respectively). As indicated in the figure legends, proteins from anti-PTEN or anti-SHIP-2 immunoprecipitates were also tested. Assays were done in 100 μl of phosphatase buffer consisting of 100 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 1 mm dithiothreitol, and protease inhibitors as indicated above. Reactions were stopped by addition of 200 μl of chloroform:methanol (1:1, v/v). The samples were then dried, deacylated, and analyzed by HPLC on a Partisphere SAX column (Whatman International Ltd.) as described previously (30Sultan C. Breton M. Mauco G. Grondin P. Plantavid M. Chap H. Biochem. J. 1990; 269: 831-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). VSMC Nuclei Contain Phosphoinositide 5- and 3-Phosphatase Activities—As we described previously (22Bacqueville D. Deleris P. Mendre C. Pieraggi M.T. Chap H. Guillon G. Perret B. Breton-Douillon M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 22170-22176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), our isolation procedure yields nuclei of high purity. In nuclear preparations, lactate dehydrogenase and 5′-nucleotidase activities, recognized as markers for cytoplasm and plasma membranes, respectively, represented <0.3% of the activity in the total homogenate. Immunoblot analysis revealed that nuclear fractions were devoid of tubulin, a cytoskeleton marker, but were highly enriched with nucleoporin p62, a protein of the nuclear pore complex. Electron microscopy analysis showed that the lysis procedure maintained the nucleolar structure and removed the nuclear envelope to leave the lamina and nuclear pore remnants. We reported previously that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is the only 3-PI synthesized from endogenous precursors within the VSMC nuclei stripped of their nuclear envelopes. However, the mechanisms regulating the level of nuclear PtdIns(3,4,5)P3, especially its degradation pathway(s), remains unclear. Therefore, we first investigated whether PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 could be dephosphorylated by nuclear enzymes in growing VSMCs. Nuclear and cellular extracts were incubated 30 min with purified [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 specifically labeled on the D-3 position of the inositol ring. Then, the dephosphorylated radioactive products were analyzed by HPLC. HPLC profiles of both membrane-depleted nuclei (Fig. 1, middle panel) and whole-cell lysates (Fig. 1, lower panel) revealed a peak of [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2 (4,306 ± 919 dpm/1.5 × 107 nuclei, n = 3; 16,911 ± 693 dpm/107 cells, n = 3) and a peak of 32P-labeled inorganic phosphate (1,249 ± 295 dpm/1.5 × 107 nuclei, n = 3; 11,621 ± 924 dpm/107 cells, n = 3), demonstrating the existence of PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 5- and 3-phosphatase activities in VSMCs, respectively. [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 alone was analyzed as control (Fig. 1, upper panel). Interestingly, the 5-phosphatase activity was higher than the 3-phosphatase activity in the nuclear compartment, whereas these activities presented a similar potency in the total cellular homogenate. We next carried out time-course studies to compare the activities of the two PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 phosphatases in the nuclear compartment and whole-cell lysate and to determine which phosphatase preferentially uses PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 as substrate in the nucleus (Fig. 2). Nuclear extract incubation with [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 up to 60 min induced an increase of both [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2 and 32Pi (Fig. 2, upper panel). Moreover, we observed a higher level of [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2 synthesis compared with 32Pi along the kinetic points. In contrast, [32P]PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 incubation with cell lysate resulted in a rapid accumulation of [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2 sustained until 60 min and showed a constant 32Pi increase (Fig. 2, lower panel). Indeed, nucleus and cell lysates showed interesting differences in their relative 32Pi: [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2 ratio. This ratio was constant in nuclei (between 0.21 and 0.24), whereas it continuously increased from 0.44 to 1.33 in VSMC homogenates. Moreover, nuclei exhibited a lower 32Pi:[32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2 ratio, which was about 6-fold less than the one observed for total VSMCs at 60 min. These data suggest that PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 is hydrolyzed by both 5- or 3-phosphatases in VSMCs but is preferentially hydrolyzed by a 5-phosphatase in the nuclear compartment. To test whether PtdIns(3,4)P2 could be dephosphorylated by a nuclear 3-phosphatase, purified [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2 labeled on the D-3 position was used as substrate. As shown in Fig. 3, incubation of nuclei with [32P]PtdIns(3,4)P2 induced a significant production of 32Pi (2,888 ± 737 dpm/1.5 × 107 nuclei, n = 3) characteristic of a PtdIns 3-phosphatase activity. Altogether these results indicate the presence of active PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 5- and 3-phosphatases in VSMCs, but in nuclei, the PtdIns(3,4,5)P3 5-phosphatase could be the primary enzyme responsible for hydrolyzing PtdIns(3,4,5)P3.Fig. 2Time-course studies of nuclear and cellular PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 5- and 3-phosphatase activities.

It is important in lymphopoiesis, inflammatory recruitment of leukocytes, and other situations that require cell adhesion to the vascular endothelium. The avidity of the cells expressing α4β1 integrin can be rapidly changed by chemokines and chemoattractants. Different mechanisms, including changes in the number of interacting molecules due to the alteration of the receptor topology or changes in the affinity of the individual bonds, have been proposed to explain the nature of these fast changes in avidity. Recently, we described a fluorescent LDV-containing small molecule, which we used to monitor the affinity changes on live cells in real time (Chigaev, A., Blenc, A. M., Braaten, J. V., Kumaraswamy, N., Kepley, C. L., Andrews, R. P., Oliver, J. M., Edwards, B. S., Prossnitz, E. R., Larson, R. S. et al. (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276, 48670–48678). Here we show that the affinity of the small molecule probe as well as the native ligand vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 varies in parallel when the integrin is modulated with divalent cations and that the affinity modulation leads to the changes in cell avidity. Using formyl peptide receptor-transfected U937 cells, we further show that the time course of avidity changes in response to the receptor activation coincides with the time course of the affinity changes. Taken together, these data are consistent with the idea that affinity regulation is a major factor that governs the avidity of cell adhesion mediated by the α4 integrin.

Cell. 1994; 76: 301-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6373) Google Scholar). The adhesion between endothelial cells and leukocytes is regulated by changes in the number of interacting adhesion molecules due to the difference in the expression level, molecular trafficking, and/or internalization; changes in topographical distribution due to clustering, dimerization, and other forms of molecular assembly; and changes in affinity of the individual molecules to their counterstructures (2Grabovsky V.

It mediates binding to the CS-1 domain of fibronectin and to the vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), an immunoglobulin superfamily member induced by cytokines on endothelium (10Haraldsen G.

In particular, it has been suggested that the changes in VLA-4-dependent adhesion are due to either the clustering of the integrin or its conformational state. It is also possible that receptor clustering controls the tethering and rolling interactions of the low affinity resting receptor, whereas firm attachment and arrest is associated with receptor activation and affinity change (2Grabovsky V.

Recently, we found that the changes in VLA-4 affinity can be detected using an LDV-FITC-containing small molecule on leukocytes in real time and in a physiologically relevant time frame. We confirmed that VLA-4 exhibited multiple affinity states regulated by divalent cations. We also showed that for several chemokine receptors the physiologically activated state of the α4β1 integrin, determined by inside-out signaling, has similar affinity in several cell types (13Chigaev A. Blenc A.M. Braaten J.V. Kumaraswamy N. Kepley C.L. Andrews R.P. Oliver J.M. Edwards B.S. Prossnitz E.R. Larson R.S. Sklar L.A. J. Biol.

We used the LDV-FITC-containing small molecule in this study to investigate the relationship between α4β1-integrin affinity states and cell aggregation. The affinity states were generated using different concentrations of divalent cations (Ca2+ and Mn2+) or chemoattractant receptor activation. Through direct binding studies, we have also evaluated the affinity and dissociation rate of the natural ligand, VCAM-1. Indeed, we find a strong correlation between the affinity state and the adhesive properties of cells. This result begins to clarify the potential roles of integrin affinity changes in the regulation of cell adhesion.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—The VLA-4-specific ligand (14Chen C. Mobley J.L.

Transfection into B78H1 was done using the LipofectAMINE Reagent (Invitrogen). High expressors were selected using the MoFlo Flow Cytometer (Cytomation, Inc., Fort Collins, CO). Cells were grown in RPMI 1640 (supplemented with 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum) and then harvested and resuspended in 1 ml of HEPES buffer (110 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% human serum albumin and stored on ice. The buffer was depleted of lipopolysaccharide by affinity chromatography over polymyxin B-Sepharose (Detoxigel; Pierce). Cells were counted using the Coulter Multisizer/Z2 analyzer (Beckman Coulter, Inc.). For experiments, cells were suspended with the same HEPES buffer at 1 × 106 cells/ml and warmed to 37 °C. The expression of adhesion molecules was measured with fluorescent mAbs and quantified by comparison with a standard curve generated with Quantum Simply Cellular microspheres (Bangs Laboratories, Inc., Fishers, IN) stained in parallel with the same mAb. This produces an estimate of the total mAb-binding sites/cell (19Edwards B.S. Curry M.S. Tsuji H. Brown D. Larson R.S. Sklar L.A. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Typically, we find 800,000–1,200,000 VCAM-1 sites per CHO or B78H1 cell and 40,000–60,000 VLA-4 sites per U937 cell.Calibration of Small Molecule Binding—The analysis of binding and calibration of the LDV-FITC-containing small molecule, a VLA-4-specific ligand, to peripheral blood cells and cell lines was described previously (13Chigaev A. Blenc A.M. Braaten J.V. Kumaraswamy N. Kepley C.L. Andrews R.P. Oliver J.M. Edwards B.S. Prossnitz E.R. Larson R.S. Sklar L.A. J. Biol.

Briefly, Quantum TM 24 Premix microbeads (Flow Cytometry Standards Corp., San Juan, Puerto Rico) were used to quantitate the fluorescence intensity of cells bearing the LDV-FITC-containing small molecule. The quantum yield for the LDV-FITC small molecule was not changed upon the binding to the VLA-4 receptor. 2Chigaev, A., Buranda, T., Dwyer, D. C., Prossnitz, E. R., and Sklar, L. A. (2003) Biophys. J., in press. One or two drops of beads were added to 0.5 ml of isotonic phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2), and the mean channel fluorescence (MCF) for all calibrated microbeads was collected. The number of molecules of equivalent soluble fluorochromes (MESF) was plotted versus the MCF for the four fluorescent microbeads. The graph was used to estimate the total number of MESF per cell. The total receptor concentration is calculated from the number of cells and the sites (MESF) per cell.Equilibrium Binding of the LDV-FITC-containing Small Molecule and the VCAM-FITC Protein—For equilibrium binding studies of the LDV-FITC-containing small molecule and the VCAM-FITC protein, cells were treated with a range of concentrations of the fluorescent ligand in the presence of divalent cations (see “Results”) in HEPES buffer (110 mm NaCl, 10 mm affinity KCl, 10 mm glucose, 1 mm MgCl2, and 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) containing 0.1% human serum albumin. U937 cells were used at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml, which corresponds to 0.08 nm VLA-4 (50,000 sites/cell). Incubations have been performed for short times at 37 °C and overnight on ice with qualitatively similar results. Since the equilibration time of high affinity small molecules typically depends on their dissociation rate, we found it experimentally convenient to perform overnight incubations. It was not necessary to introduce a wash step between cell incubation and analysis of LDV-FITC-containing small molecule as the flow cytometer intrinsically discriminates free and bound ligand at least up to 30 nm (see Ref. 21Sklar L.A. Edwards B.S. Graves S.W. Nolan J.P. Prossnitz E.R. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 2002; 31: 97-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar and references therein). The signal/background ratio was usually 4–6:1 (see Fig. 2 in Ref. 13Chigaev A. Blenc A.M. Braaten J.V. Kumaraswamy N. Kepley C.L. Andrews R.P. Oliver J.M. Edwards B.S. Prossnitz E.R. Larson R.S. Sklar L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48670-48678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). For VCAM-FITC (up to 1 μm), cells were fixed after the incubation with 2% paraformaldehyde overnight on ice, and the unbound ligand was washed three times with PBS. Nonspecific binding was determined using a 500-fold excess of unlabeled ligand. Analysis was performed on a FACScan (Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA) by acquiring 5000–10,000 events. Thus, MCF values for specific and nonspecific binding were obtained for each ligand concentration; the difference between the two, ΔMCF, represents specific binding, and the calibration curve allows ΔMCF to be converted into concentration of occupied receptor. Because instrument sensitivity was varied between experiments, the mean channel fluorescence values are not comparable between experiments. Dissociation constants (Kd) were calculated using a single site (hyperbolic) binding equation from measurements of the site concentration, site occupancy, and free ligand (curve fits were performed using GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA).Kinetic Analysis of Binding and Dissociation—Cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) were preincubated in HEPES buffer with different conditions of divalent cations for 10–30 min at 37 °C. Flow cytometric data were acquired continuously for up to 1000 s, and the samples were stirred with a 5 × 2-mm magnetic stir bar (Bel-Art Products, Pequannock, NJ) at 300 rpm at 37 °C. Samples were analyzed for 30–120 s to establish a base line, the fluorescent ligand was added, and acquisition was reestablished, creating a 5–10-s gap in the time course. For dissociation kinetic measurements, cell samples were preincubated with either small fluorescent ligand or rhVCAM-1-FITC and treated with excess unlabeled LDV-containing small molecule, and the dissociation of the fluorescent molecule was followed. The resulting data were converted to mean channel fluorescence over time using FCSQuery software developed by Bruce Edwards.Rapid Mix Flow Cytometry—We used a rapid mix flow cytometer to determine the dissociation rate of VCAM-FITC from a rapidly dissociating intermediate affinity state of VLA-4 (1 mm Mn2+, 10 mm Ca2+) (22Graves S.W. Nolan J.P. Jett J.H. Martin J.C. Sklar L.A. Cytometry. 2002; 47: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 23Nolan J.P. Posner R.G. Martin J.C. Habbersett R. Sklar L.A. Cytometry. 1995; 21: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) that could not be determined manually as above. Cells (4 × 106 cells/ml) were preincubated in HEPES buffer with 500 nm VCAM-FITC for 50–60 min at 37 °C. Next, samples were analyzed for 5–10 s to establish the base line, and then the LDV-containing small molecule (250 μm) in a buffer containing the same concentration of VCAM-FITC (to avoid sample dilution) was mixed with the cell suspension. The mixing time was under 200 ms. Experiments were performed at room temperature.Competitive Equilibrium and Kinetic Binding Assay for Unlabeled Ligand—Competitive binding experiments were performed with the native ligand, soluble rhVCAM-1, to obtain both equilibrium features of the native molecule. The inhibition of the binding of LDV-FITC to VLA-4 on U937 cells was evaluated at room temperature. Cells (1 × 105 cells/ml; 0.008 nm VLA-4) were equilibrated in HEPES buffer in the presence of 0.3 nm LDV-FITC (ligand) overnight on ice. The concentrations of rhVCAM-1 (competitor) were varied, and divalent cation concentrations were used to vary VLA-4 affinity. The dissociation constants for the binding of the competitor were determined by examination of the fractional receptor occupancy by the fluorescent ligand, assuming a single class of binding sites (Kd values were calculated using GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA) software according to the Cheng and Prusoff equation). The fractional occupancy of receptor (VLA-4) by ligand (LDV-FITC) in the presence of competitor (rhVCAM-1) was calculated (24Sklar L.A. Sayre J. McNeil V.M. Finney D.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1985; 28: 323-330PubMed Google Scholar) (see “Analysis and Simulation of Binding Experiments”). We performed kinetic competition experiments using the LDV-FITC-containing small molecule as ligand and rhVCAM-1 as competitor to obtain rate information for the unlabeled ligand. Three experimental protocols described in Ref. 24Sklar L.A. Sayre J. McNeil V.M. Finney D.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1985; 28: 323-330PubMed Google Scholar were used. In protocol I (binding), the kinetics of binding of the LDV-FITC-containing small molecule in the absence of rhVCAM-1 (competitor) provides information about the on and off rate constants for LDV-FITC (k 1 and k –1). In protocol II (direct competition), the binding kinetics of the LDV-FITC-containing small molecule when ligand and competitor were added to the U937 cell suspension simultaneously is sensitive to the on rate of VCAM-1 (k 2). In protocol III (displacement), the U937 cell suspension was first preincubated with an excess of the competitor (rhVCAM-1; 100–1000 nm) to fully occupy the receptors. The binding of the LDV-FITC small molecule is sensitive to the off rate of VCAM-1 (k –2). In this case, binding can occur only as competitor dissociates from the receptor. The binding was initiated by a 1:10–100 dilution of the cell suspension into the solution of the LDV-FITC-containing small molecule (3–5 nm) solution. The experimental data were fit using the model of the competitive binding (see “Analysis and Simulation of Binding Experiments”).Statistical Analysis—Curve fits and statistics were performed using GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA). For the analysis of competitive binding experiments performed with the native unlabeled ligand (rhVCAM-1), we used the Berkeley Madonna™ package as described under “Modeling of Competitive Binding Experiments.” Mean values and S.E. are presented in the tables and figures.Scheme 2View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)KdL=k-1k1(Eq. 1) KdC=k-2k2(Eq. 2) For the kinetic modeling, we used the following system of equations. d(LR)dt=k1(L)(R)-k-1(LR)(Eq. 3) d(CR)dt=k2(C)(R)-k-2(CR)(Eq. 4) d(R)dt=k-1(LR)+k-2(CR)-k1(L)(R)-k2(C)(R)(Eq. 5) d(L)dt=k-1(LR)-k1(L)(R)(Eq. 6) d(C)dt=k-2(CR)-k2(C)(R)(Eq. 7) The kinetics of small molecule binding in the absence of the competitor was fitted using the off rates (k –1), determined in the kinetic off rate experiment for each affinity state (see Table I and Fig. 1, B and C). Association rate constants (k 1) were calculated from Equation 1 as a ratio between k –1 and KdL , determined in the equilibrium binding experiments (see Table I and Fig. 1A). Kinetic data from the competitive binding experiment were fitted using on rates (k 1) and off rates (k –1), determined in the absence of the competitor. Since the Kd of the competitor was determined from equilibrium competition (Fig. 2C), k 2 and k –2 were overdetermined and could uniquely fit the data.

C, competitive equilibrium experiment plotting relative fluorescence of LDV-FITC-containing small molecule binding versus VCAM-1 concentration. U937 cells (1 × 105 cells/ml) were incubated with the indicated concentration of the rhVCAM-1 in the presence of the LDV-FITC-containing small molecule (0.3 nm) overnight on ice. The binding data are normalized to 1 for specific binding in the absence of rhVCAM-1 and 0 for complete inhibition in the presence of rhVCAM-1 and fitted to a single site competition equation (GraphPad Prism (San Diego, CA)). Two affinity states of VLA-4 (1 mm Mn2+ (○) and 1 mm Mn2+ plus 1 mm Ca2+ (□)) are shown. Data are averages from three experiments, and the IC50 values are 38 and 67 nm, respectively. Kd values (Table II, Kd data in parenthesis) were calculated using GraphPad Prism software according to the Cheng and Prusoff equation. D, kinetic competition experiment plotted as ΔMCF versus time following the addition of LDV-FITC-containing small molecule. MCF values corresponding to the blocked samples were subtracted. The protocol III, displacement, as described in Ref. 24Sklar L.A. Sayre J. McNeil V.M. Finney D.A. Mol. Pharmacol. 1985; 28: 323-330PubMed Google Scholar is shown. The U937 cell suspension (107/ml) was first preincubated with an excess of the competitor (1 μm rhVCAM) to occupy the VLA-4 receptors. Next, the cell suspension was diluted (1:100) into the LDV-FITC (5 nm) ligand solution. The binding of the LDV-FITC-containing small molecule can occur only as competitor (rhVCAM) dissociates from the receptor. As a result, this protocol is sensitive to the competitor off rate (k –2; Scheme 2).

https://openalex.org/W2023599431,"We reported previously that egg membrane rafts serve as a subcellular microdomain for sperm-dependent tyrosine kinase signaling in Xenopus fertilization. Moreover, we demonstrated that raft-associated Src tyrosine kinase was activated by sperm in vitro. Here we show that egg rafts incubated with sperm or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can promote Src-dependent phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) and transient calcium release in the extracts of unfertilized Xenopus eggs. In vivo egg activation by sperm or H2O2 also promotes tyrosinephosphorylation and raft-translocalization of PLCγ. Immunodepletion of PLCγ from the egg extracts inhibits the raft-dependent calcium release. Rafts prepared from H2O2-activated eggs also promote Src-dependent dephosphorylation of p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase and cell cycle transition from metaphase II to interphase in egg extracts. PLCγ phosphorylation and calcium release in egg extracts can be promoted by rafts prepared from COS-7 cells expressing the Xenopus Src gene. These results demonstrate that the signaling events elicited by fertilization in Xenopus eggs can be reconstituted in vitro. The development of such experimental platforms will allow us to dissect the molecular mechanism of sperm-dependent activation of raft-associated Src and subsequent up-regulation of PLCγ and egg activation machinery in Xenopus eggs.

Fertilization is triggered by the interaction of gametes followed by a subsequent increase in the free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) 1The abbreviations used are: [Ca2+] i , free calcium concentration; APMSF, 4-amidinobenzylsulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride; CSF, cytostatic factor; DB, DeBoer's solution; InsPtd(1,4,5)P3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; MAP kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase; PKA, protein kinase A; PLC, phospholipase C; PTK, protein-tyrosine kinase; RGDS, Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser peptide; F-rafts, rafts from fertilized eggs; H-raft, rafts from H2O2-activated eggs; A-rafts, rafts from A23187-treated eggs; Uf-rafts, rafts from unfertilized eggs; SH2, Src homology 2; GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. within the egg cytoplasm. This paradigm of initiation of development is conserved evolutionarily in a wide range of higher eukaryotic species, from worms to mammals and plants. Whereas the molecular diversity of the gameteinteracting machinery guarantees a species-specific gamete interaction, there seems to exist a canonical series of intracellular events accompanying the fertilization-induced Ca2+ signaling process. Namely, fertilized eggs undergo a transient Ca2+ release at least in part through the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsPtd(1,4,5)P3)-dependent pathway (1Miyazaki S. Shirakawa H. Nakada K. Honda Y. Dev. Biol. 1993; 158: 62-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 2Stricker S.A. Dev. Biol. 1999; 211: 157-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar). This Ca2+ release signal is necessary and sufficient to initiate a series of events associated with embryonic development, such as entry into the somatic cell cycle that involves the completion of the meiotic cell cycle and de novo DNA synthesis (3Whitaker M. Swann K. Development. 1993; 117: 1-12Google Scholar, 4Schultz R.M. Kopf G.S. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1995; 30: 21-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Several lines of evidence indicate that a certain kind(s) of phospholipase C (PLC), a family of enzymes that produce InsPtd(1,4,5)P3 and diacylglycerol from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, may play a direct role in the sperm-induced production of InsPtd(1,4,5)P3 in the eggs of sea urchin (5Lee S.J.

However, the precise roles of each PLC subspecies, the mechanisms of activation, and the source of the relevant PLCs (from sperm, eggs, or both) in sperm-induced InsPtd(1,4,5)P3 production and Ca2+ release remain controversial (16Swann K.

Fertilization is accompanied by a rapid and transient increase of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in the eggs, indicating that protein-tyrosine kinases (PTKs) are activated upon fertilization. Fertilization-induced protein-tyrosine phosphorylation is synchronous with, or even earlier than, the release of Ca2+, suggesting that tyrosine phosphorylation is upstream of Ca2+ release. PTK inhibitors or recombinant proteins that antagonize enodogenous PTK function have been shown to block sperm-induced Ca2+ release in sea urchin (18Abassi Y.A. Carroll D.J. Giusti A.F.

Thus, activation of PTKs in eggs may be necessary and sufficient to cause Ca2+ release, although the molecular identities of the responsible egg PTKs have not been precisely defined. In eggs of the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, a 57-kDa Src tyrosine kinase (29Steele R.E. Unger T.F. Mardis M.J. Fero J.B. J. Biol.

Fukami, unpublished data. which we have formerly denoted Xyk, is activated within 1 min of fertilization (30Sato K. Aoto M. Mori K. Akasofu S. Tokmakov A.A. Sahara S. Fukami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13250-13257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), and the γ-subspecies of PLC (PLCγ) becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated, activated, and interact with Src within 2 min of fertilization (12Sato K. Tokmakov A.A. Iwasaki T. Fukami Y. Dev. Biol. 2000; 224: 453-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Inhibition of the Src activity of the egg blocks tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PLCγ, production of InsPtd(1,4,5)P3, Ca2+ release, and resumption of the meiotic cell cycle (12Sato K. Tokmakov A.A. Iwasaki T. Fukami Y. Dev. Biol. 2000; 224: 453-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 24Sato K. Iwao Y. Fujimura T. Tamaki I. Ogawa K. Iwasaki T. Tokmakov A.A. Hatano O. Fukami Y. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 308-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar), suggesting that the Src-PLCγ signaling cascade is involved in fertilization. Xenopus egg Src localizes primarily to egg cortical membranes, and a portion of the fertilization-activated Src undergoes a translocation from the membrane to the cytosolic fraction (24Sato K. Iwao Y. Fujimura T. Tamaki I. Ogawa K. Iwasaki T. Tokmakov A.A. Hatano O. Fukami Y. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 308-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 30Sato K. Aoto M. Mori K. Akasofu S. Tokmakov A.A. Sahara S. Fukami Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13250-13257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). More recently, we have found that this PTK is enriched in low-density detergent-insoluble membrane fractions of eggs (31Sato K. Iwasaki T. Ogawa K. Konishi M. Tokmakov A.A. Fukami Y. Development. 2002; 129: 885-896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Xenopus eggs low density detergent-insoluble membrane fractions are also enriched in cholesterol and the ganglioside GM1, indicating that they have characteristics of membrane “rafts” (32Simons K. Ikonen E. Nature. 1997; 387: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (8117) Google Scholar, 33Brown D.A. London E. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1998; 14: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2551) Google Scholar). Rafts appear to have a primary role in Xenopus egg fertilization, because sperm-induced protein-tyrosine phosphorylation, including that of Src, takes place in rafts (31Sato K. Iwasaki T. Ogawa K. Konishi M. Tokmakov A.A. Fukami Y. Development. 2002; 129: 885-896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the cholesterol-binding compound methyl-β-cyclodextrin abolishes sperm-egg interaction and/or subsequent Src activation (31Sato K. Iwasaki T. Ogawa K. Konishi M. Tokmakov A.A. Fukami Y. Development. 2002; 129: 885-896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The functional importance of egg rafts has also been suggested in sea urchin fertilization (34Belton R.J. Adams N.L. Foltz K.R. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 2001; 59: 294-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, the significance of the structural and functional interaction of rafts with the egg cytoplasm and the involvement of Src-PLCγ pathway in this interaction remain to be established. For the convenience of fertilization signaling analysis, it would certainly be helpful to develop a cell-free system in which signaling events of fertilization can be analyzed. Egg extracts from unfertilized Xenopus eggs, called CSF (cytostatic factor-arrested) extracts, are known to undergo the Ca2+-dependent cell cycle transition as seen in fertilized eggs (35Lohka M.J. Masui Y. Science. 1983; 220: 719-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (454) Google Scholar, 36Lohka M.J. Maller J.L. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 101: 518-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar, 37Murray A.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). On the other hand, our previous study has demonstrated that sperm-egg interaction and Src signaling can be reconstituted using isolated rafts (31Sato K. Iwasaki T. Ogawa K. Konishi M. Tokmakov A.A. Fukami Y. Development. 2002; 129: 885-896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore made an effort to investigate whether isolated rafts and CSF extracts can reconstitute the functional interaction between Src and PLCγ leading to a transient Ca2+ release and cell cycle transition. Experiments designed to determine the role of Src and PLC activity revealed a novel role of rafts and a functional cross-talk between rafts and egg extracts, which may operate in physiological Xenopus egg fertilization. Animals and Antibodies—X. laevis were purchased from a domestic dealer (Hamamatsu Seibutsu Kyozai, Hamamatsu, Japan). Anti-Src tyrosine kinase polyclonal antibody, anti-pepY antibody, which has been shown to recognize Xenopus Src (24Sato K. Iwao Y. Fujimura T. Tamaki I. Ogawa K. Iwasaki T. Tokmakov A.A. Hatano O. Fukami Y. Dev.

Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1988Google Scholar). A monoclonal antibody against mammalian PLCγ was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). Monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody PY99 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). An antibody against phosphorylated MAP (mitogen-activated protein) kinase was from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). Anti-FLAG antibody (M2 clone) was from Sigma. Chemicals—Leupeptin was purchased from Peptide Institute (Osaka, Japan). 4-Amidinobenzylsulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (APMSF) was obtained from Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). H2O2 was purchased from Santoku Chemical Industries (Tokyo, Japan). The Ca2+ ionophore A23187 and a synthetic Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) peptide were from Sigma. cAMP and GTPγS were from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). [γ-32P]ATP (>7,000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from ICN Biomedicals (Costa Mesa, CA). A tyrosine kinase substrate peptide, Cdc2 peptide, and Src inhibitor peptide, peptide A7, and its inactive derivative, peptide A9, were prepared as described previously (39Fukami Y. Sato K. Ikeda K. Kamisango K. Koizumi K. Matsuno T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1132-1140Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PP2, PP3, U-73122, U-73343, and heparin were from Calbiochem. Fura 2 was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Other chemicals were from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan), Sigma, or Wako. Eggs, Egg Activation, and Sperm—Unless otherwise stated, all procedures were carried out at ambient temperature. To obtain eggs, Xenopus adult females were injected subcutaneously with 40–80 units of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin. After 3–6 days of the injection, the same animals were induced to ovulate with an injection of 500 units of human chorionic gonadotropin (Teikokuzoki, Tokyo, Japan). Ovulation began 6–8 h after the second injection. Eggs were washed three times with DeBoer's buffer (DB: 110 mm NaCl, 1.3 mm KCl, 0.44 mm CaCl2, pH 7.2–7.4, adjusted by NaHCO3) and then gently incubated with more than a 2-fold volume of DB supplemented with 2% cysteine and 0.06 n NaOH, pH 7.8, for 3–5 min. The resulting dejellied eggs were used within 2 h. Eggs were activated by jelly water-treated Xenopus sperm (see below), H2O2, or A23187, as described previously (31Sato K. Iwasaki T. Ogawa K. Konishi M. Tokmakov A.A. Fukami Y. Development. 2002; 129: 885-896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After the activation treatment, eggs were immediately washed with DB, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, and kept at –80 °C. Unfertilized eggs in the same batch of the preparation were also frozen, and kept at –80 °C as control. To obtain sperm, a pair of testes were removed from Xenopus adult males, minced, and washed twice with ice-cold DB. The washed sperm (about 108 sperm from one animal) was incubated with excess volume of Xenopus egg jelly water for 10 min. After the incubation, the mixture was centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended with 1 ml of DB and was designated jelly water-treated sperm. Demembranated sperm nuclei were prepared according to the described methods (37Murray A.W. Methods Cell Biol. 1991; 36: 581-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). Briefly, the washed sperm pellet was resuspended with 1 ml of nuclear preparation buffer (250 mm sucrose, 15 mm Hepes-NaOH, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm spermidine trihydrochloride, 0.2 mm spermidine tetrahydrochloride, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 3% bovine serum albumin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μm APMSF, pH 7.4). The suspension was added with lysolecithin (0.5 mg/ml) and incubated for 5 min. After the incubation, the suspension was added to 10 ml of ice-cold nuclear preparation buffer and centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet fraction was resuspended with 1 ml of nuclear preparation buffer containing 30% glycerol, and stored at –80 °C until required. Egg Low Density Detergent-insoluble Membrane (Rafts)—Egg rafts were prepared as described previously (31Sato K. Iwasaki T. Ogawa K. Konishi M. Tokmakov A.A. Fukami Y. Development. 2002; 129: 885-896Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. All manipulations were conducted on ice or at 4 °C. Eggs were mixed with 5-fold volume of ice-cold buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 20 μm APMSF, pH 7.5) supplemented with 150 mm NaCl and 250 mm sucrose, and homogenized with a 7-ml Dounce tissue grinder (Wheaton, Millville, NJ). The homogenates were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min, and the supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 20 min. Concentrated Triton X-100 (25%) was then added to the fluffy layer of the pellet (crude membranes) to yield a final concentration of Triton X-100 at 1%. The mixtures were homogenized again, incubated on ice for 10 min, and mixed with equal volumes of ice-cold buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl and 85% sucrose. The resulting mixtures (5 ml) were layered first with 19 ml of 30% sucrose and second with 12 ml of 5% sucrose in the same buffer. The samples were centrifuged at 144,000 × g for 20–24 h in an SW28 rotor (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA). After the centrifugation, 3-ml aliquots of 12 fractions were collected from the top to the bottom of the tubes. Fractions 3–6 were pooled as egg rafts, whereas fractions 10–12 were pooled as detergent-soluble non-raft fractions. In some experiments, egg rafts were diluted with water more than 4-fold and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 30 min. Such concentrated rafts were resuspended with 200 μl of buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl, and used for experiments. In Vitro Src Tyrosine Kinase Assay—Src tyrosine kinase activity in rafts was determined by an in vitro kinase assay using Cdc2 peptide as an exogenous substrate (24Sato K. Iwao Y. Fujimura T. Tamaki I. Ogawa K. Iwasaki T. Tokmakov A.A. Hatano O. Fukami Y. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 308-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Concentrated raft fractions (10 μl) were preincubated with or without raft activators such as 106/ml sperm, 1 mm GTPγS,1mm cAMP, 1 mm RGDS peptide, or 1 mm CaCl2 for 10 min at 30 °C. The mixtures were further incubated at 30 °C for 10 min in the presence of 5 mm MgCl2, 20 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 2 μm [γ-32P]ATP (10 μCi), and 1 mm Cdc2 peptide. The reaction was stopped by the addition of Laemmli's SDS sample buffer (40Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar) followed by heat treatment at 98 °C for 5 min. 32P-Labeled Cdc2 peptide was separated by SDS-PAGE on 16% gels and analyzed by a BAS2000 Bioimaging analyzer (Fuji Film, Tokyo, Japan). A similar experiment was conducted to determine Src tyrosine kinase activity that was released from the rafts. In this case, raft samples (50 μg, 100 μl) were mixed with 1 ml of buffer A containing 150 mm NaCl, and centrifuged at 150,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatants (100 μl) were incubated with 1 μlof anti-pepY antibody for 3 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were adsorbed onto protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences), washed, and subjected to incubation in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP and Cdc2 peptide as described above. Tyrosine Phosphorylation of PLCγ—Rafts alone (3 μl), CSF extracts alone (27 μl), or a mixture of both were incubated in the absence or presence of 1.5 μl of the activators (see above) and/or 1.5 μl of various inhibitors: 10 μm PP2, 10 μm PP3, 10 μm U73122, 10 μm U73343, 100 μm heparin, or 5 mm EGTA, for 10 min at 30 °C. The mixtures were then incubated with 5 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm ATP for 10 min. The kinase reaction was terminated by the addition of 30 μl of 10 mm EDTA on ice. Proteins were solubilized by incubation in the presence of 0.1% SDS and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate at 37 °C for 10 min, and collected as the supernatant fractions by centrifugation at 150,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant fractions were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-PLCγ antibody followed by immunoblotting to analyze the amount as well as the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ. Alternatively, phosphorylation of PLCγ was determined in rafts and non-rafts that had been prepared from several egg samples. In this case, 10 μg of protein from the SDS-solubilized rafts and 500 μg of proteins from the Triton X-100-soluble non-rafts were subjected to immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. Immunoprecipitation, SDS-PAGE, and Immunoblotting—Protein samples (50–500 μg, specified in the text) were immunoprecipitated with 1 μl of anti-pepY antiserum or 3 μg of anti-PLCγ antibody for 3 h at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, the immune complexes were adsorbed onto 10 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads by gentle agitation for 30 min at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with 500 μl of RIPA buffer, washed once with buffer A, and used as immunoprecipitates. The immunoprecipitates prepared as above were treated with Laemmli's SDS sample buffer (42Tokmakov A.A. Sato K.-I. Iwasaki T. Fukami Y. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) at 98 °C for 5 min. SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting of the SDS-denatured proteins was done as described previously (12Sato K. Tokmakov A.A. Iwasaki T. Fukami Y. Dev. Biol. 2000; 224: 453-469Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 24Sato K. Iwao Y. Fujimura T. Tamaki I. Ogawa K. Iwasaki T. Tokmakov A.A. Hatano O. Fukami Y. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 308-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Phosphorylation of p42 MAP kinase was analyzed by direct application of protein samples to SDS-PAGE on 8% gels. Immunodepletion of PLCγ—Depletion of PLCγ was done by incubating CSF extracts (100 μl) with anti-PLCγ antibody (1 μl) for 3 h at 4 °C followed by the adsorption of the immune complexes onto protein ASepharose beads. The resulting supernatant fractions were used as CSF extracts depleted of PLCγ (CSF/ΔPLCγ). The efficiency of the depletion was determined by densitometric scanning of the anti-PLCγ immunoblotting data for intact CSF extracts and CSF/ΔPLCγ. Other Methods—Preparation of CSF extracts, measurement of Ca2+ release, and cell cycle transition assay were carried out as described (41Tokmakov A.A. Sato K.-I. Fukami Y. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 82: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 42Tokmakov A.A. Sato K.-I. Iwasaki T. Fukami Y. Cell Calcium. 2002; 32: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).

Iwasaki, K. Sato, and Y. Fukami, unpublished results. Sperm Activates Src Tyrosine Kinase in Isolated Egg Rafts—We first examined the activity of the raft-associated Src in the presence of sperm and an exogenous Src substrate, Cdc2 peptide. As shown in the left panel of Fig. 1A, peptide phosphorylation was stimulated about 3-fold by the sperm. A similar extent of activation was observed with GTPγS, a G-protein activator that has been shown to activate Xenopus eggs (see “Discussion”). On the other hand, cAMP, an integrin-interacting peptide RGDS, and CaCl2 did not show such an effect (Fig. 1A). The Src-specific inhibitor PP2 completely blocked the peptide phosphorylation induced by either sperm or GTPγS (data not shown), suggesting that raft-induced peptide phosphorylation is mediated by Src (see “Discussion”). We then determined whether Src is released from rafts in the presence of activators. Mixtures of rafts and activators were ultracentrifuged, supernatant fractions were immunoprecipitated with an anti-Src antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were subjected to an in vitro kinase assay. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 1A, sperm, cAMP, and RGDS, but neither GTPγS nor CaCl2, caused a release of peptide kinase activity from rafts (see “Discussion”). In these experiments, Src activity was not detectable in sperm alone controls. Raft-associated Src Promotes Phosphorylation of PLCγ in CSF Extracts—To determine whether the activation of raft-associated Src is relevant to downstream signaling events, we analyzed tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ in unfertilized egg extracts (CSF extracts). Equivalent amounts of rafts, CSF extracts, or mixtures of both were subjected to the in vitro kinase assay in the presence of various activators. As shown in Fig. 1B, tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ was seen only when rafts and CSF extracts were co-incubated in the presence of either sperm or GTPγS, whereas cAMP and CaCl2 were ineffective. The sperm-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ could be abolished by PP2, but not by the PLC inhibitor U-73122 or heparin, an antagonist for InsPtd(1,4,5)P3 receptor (Fig. 1C). We also examined the subcellular localization of PLCγ before and after fertilization of Xenopus eggs. As shown in Fig. 1D, tyrosine-phosphorylated PLCγ was transiently accumulated in rafts, suggesting that PLCγ undergoes a translocation upon fertilization. Raft Localization of Active Src and PLCγ in Activated Eggs—We next analyzed a relationship between Src activation and the localization of PLCγ in activated eggs. As shown in Fig. 2A, rafts from fertilized eggs (F-rafts) and H2O2-activated eggs (H-rafts), but not rafts from A23187-treated eggs (A-rafts), showed a marked increase in Src activity when compared with those from unfertilized eggs (Uf-rafts). The extent of Src activation in the H-rafts was about 2.5-fold higher than that in the F-rafts (Fig. 2A). The Src activation was accompanied by an increase in autophosphorylation of Src (lower panels). F-rafts and H-rafts were found to contain tyrosine-phosphorylated PLCγ, and H-rafts were more prominent in the phosphorylation and translocation of PLCγ than F-rafts (Fig. 2B). Raft-dependent Ca2 + Release in CSF Extracts via the Src-PLCγ-InsPtd(1,4,5)P3 Pathway—We then examined the ability of rafts to cause Ca2+ release in CSF extracts. CSF extracts can show InsPtd(1,4,5)P3-dependent Ca2+ release that is sensitive to heparin, an antagonist for InsPtd(1,4,5)P3 receptor, but not to PP2 (Fig. 3A). As shown in Fig. 3B, sperm-incubated rafts also induced a significant increase in [Ca2+] i in CSF extracts. The mean change in the Fura 2 ratio signal was 0.08 ± 0.01 (n = 9), which corresponded to an increase in [Ca2+] i of 200–300 nm, as estimated with a calibrated curve (41Tokmakov A.A. Sato K.-I. Fukami Y. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 82: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). PP2 and U-73122, but not their inactive analogues PP3 and U-73343 (not shown), and heparin effectively"

This tropism for a particular cell type suggests that the bacteria recognize specific molecular determinants on the neutrophil surface. Current information suggests that these determinants are related to the cell-surface ligands for selectins, a family of cell adhesion molecules that mediate tethering and rolling of leukocytes on vascular surfaces during the earliest steps of inflammation (11Vestweber D.

Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Moreover, mAbs to N-terminal epitopes on human PSGL-1 inhibit binding of A. phagocytophilum to human neutrophils or HL-60 cells (26Herron M.J. Nelson C.M. Larson J. Snapp K.R. Kansas G.S. Goodman J.L. Science. 2000; 288: 1653-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Expression of both PSGL-1 and FTVII in heterologous cells renders them susceptible to binding and infection by A. phagocytophilum. These data were interpreted to indicate that A. phagocytophilum specifically recognizes fucosylated PSGL-1 (26Herron M.J. Nelson C.M. Larson J. Snapp K.R. Kansas G.S. Goodman J.L. Science. 2000; 288: 1653-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). However, measurements of bacterial interactions with intact leukocytes did not demonstrate direct binding of A. phagocytophilum to PSGL-1. Studies in mice suggest that the molecular determinants required for A. phagocytophilum binding might be more complex than those originally proposed (27Carlyon, J. A., Akkoyunlu, M., Xia, L., Yago, T., Wang, T., Cummings, R. D., McEver, R. P., and Fikrig, E. (2003) Blood, in pressGoogle Scholar). Bacterial binding to and infection of leukocytes from mice lacking both FTVII and FTIV is markedly diminished in vitro and in vivo, consistent with the observed requirement for α1–3-fucosylation of bacterial ligands on human leukocytes. However, A. phagocytophilum binds to and infects leukocytes from PSGL-1-deficient mice much like leukocytes from wild-type mice (27Carlyon, J. A., Akkoyunlu, M., Xia, L., Yago, T., Wang, T., Cummings, R. D., McEver, R. P., and Fikrig, E. (2003) Blood, in pressGoogle Scholar). Thus, A. phagocytophilum infection in both humans and mice requires sialylation and α1–3-fucosylation of neutrophils, but PSGL-1 is only required in human neutrophils. These disparities raise the possibility that A. phagocytophilum expresses distinct adhesins, which bind cooperatively to distinct ligands on leukocytes. Some of these ligands might be specific for humans or mice. In this study, we used purified molecularly defined glycoconjugates coupled to microspheres, in conjunction with experiments with transfected cells, to more precisely determine the structural features required for binding to A. phagocytophilum. Our data reveal clear differences in how P-selectin and A. phagocytophilum bind to PSGL-1. They further suggest that A. phagocytophilum binds cooperatively to distinct ligands on leukocyte surfaces. Preparation of Labeled, Fixed A. phagocytophilum—Cell-free A. phagocytophilum were prepared as described (27Carlyon, J. A., Akkoyunlu, M., Xia, L., Yago, T., Wang, T., Cummings, R. D., McEver, R.

HL-60 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Measurement of Binding of mAbs or A. phagocytophilum to Microspheres or Cells by Flow Cytometry—Microspheres, PSGL-1-transfected CHO cells, or HL-60 cells (106) in 200 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution with 0.5% human serum albumin were incubated with 10 μg/ml PL1, PL2, HECA-452, 4RA10, CHO-131, or the respective isotype-matched control murine IgG1, rat IgM, rat IgG1, or murine IgM at 4 °C for 30 min. After washing, they were incubated with FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (H + L), FITC-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG, FITC-conjugated goat anti-rat IgM, or FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM at 4 °C for 30 min. Binding of A. phagocytophilum to microspheres or cells was measured as described (27Carlyon, J. A., Akkoyunlu, M., Xia, L., Yago, T., Wang, T., Cummings, R. D., McEver, R. P., and Fikrig, E.

Briefly, 106 microspheres or CHO cells were incubated with fixed, CellTracker Green-labeled A. phagocytophilum at room temperature for 30 min in 200 μl of Hanks' balanced salt solution with 0.5% human serum albumin. After washing, microspheres or cells were fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde. In some experiments before binding assays, microspheres or cells were pretreated with a mixture of sialidases (0.6 units/ml sialidase from Arthrobacter ureafaciens and 5 μg/ml sialidase from Vibrio cholera) in Hanks' balanced salt solution with 1% human serum albumin at 37 °C for 1 h. In other experiments, binding assays were performed in the presence of 10 μg/ml anti-human PSGL-1 mAbs PL1 or PL2. Some cells were treated for 3 days (CHO cells) or 7 days (HL-60 cells) with 10 μg/ml kifunensine (Calbiochem) or for 3 days with 7.5 mm benzyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-α-d-galactopyranoside (benzyl-GalNAc) (Calbiochem). Control or treated cells were incubated with 10 μg/ml FITC-conjugated Phaseolus vulgaris leukoagglutinin (PHA-L-FITC) (Vector Laboratory) or with mAbs. Binding of mAbs, PHA-L-FITC, or A. phagocytophilum was analyzed on a BD Biosciences FACscan using CellQuest analysis software. A. phagocytophilum Binds to a Glycopeptide Modeled after the N-terminal Region of Human PSGL-1 Independently of Tyrosine Sulfation—For A. phagocytophilum binding studies, we initially used a group of well defined ligands with varying affinities for P-selectin (Fig. 1). Recombinant sPSGL-1 was coexpressed in CHO cells with FTVII and core2GlcNAcT-I to confer the glycosylation required for optimal binding to selectins (34Li F. Wilkins P.P. Crawley S. Weinstein J. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3255-3264Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). P-selectin binds to a small N-terminal region that includes three sulfated tyrosines and a core-2 O-glycan capped with sLex at Thr-16. This region contains the epitope for PL1, a mAb that blocks binding of PSGL-1 to P-selectin (37Li F. Erickson H.P. James J.A. Moore K.L. Cummings R.D. McEver R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6342-6348Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). 2-GSP-6, a glycosulfopeptide modeled after this region, binds with equivalent affinity to P-selectin (20Leppänen A. Mehta P. Ouyang Y.-B. Ju T. Helin J. Moore K.L. van Die I. Canfield W.M. McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24838-24848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). 2-GP-6, which lacks sulfate on the tyrosines, binds with much lower affinity to P-selectin. 2-GP-1 and 2-GSP-1, which have only a single N-acetylgalactosamine residue attached to Thr-16, do not detectably bind to P-selectin. sLex, a simple tetrasaccharide that lacks all peptide determinants and the core-2 O-glycan presentation, binds with very low affinity to P-selectin (21Leppänen A. White S.P. Helin J. McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39569-39578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). sPSGL-1 and each glyco(sulfo)peptide contained a C-terminal cysteine, which allowed specific attachment of biotin to the sulfhydryl group. sLex was attached to biotin through a linker. Each biotinylated ligand was coupled to streptavidin coated on 6-μm microspheres. Microspheres were prepared with equivalent densities of sPSGL-1, 2-GSP-6, 2-GSP-1, and 2-GP-6, as measured by flow cytometry with PL1 (Fig. 2A). The anti-sLex mAb HECA-452 bound equivalently to microspheres coated with 2-GSP-6 or GP-6 as expected, because each peptide contains a single core-2 O-glycan that is capped with sLex (Fig. 2B). HECA-452 bound to ∼5-fold more sites on sPSGL-1 microspheres, presumably because each sPSGL-1 molecule has several fucosylated glycans. Fluorescence-labeled, paraformaldehyde-fixed A. phagocytophilum were incubated with ligand-coupled microspheres, and binding was measured by flow cytometry. The labeled bacteria bound to sPSGL-1-coupled microspheres but not to control microspheres (Fig. 2C). The anti-PSGL-1 mAb PL1 blocked binding, whereas PL2, an mAb that recognizes a more membraneproximal epitope on PSGL-1, had no effect on binding. This result demonstrates that A. phagocytophilum adheres to a PSGL-1-coated surface lacking other glycoproteins. Furthermore, the bacteria specifically bound to microspheres coated with 2-GSP-6, demonstrating that the P-selectin binding region of PSGL-1 was sufficient for productive binding (Fig. 2D). Chelation of divalent cations with EDTA had no effect on binding, as observed previously (25Goodman J.L. Nelson C.M. Klein M.B. Hayes S.F. Weston B.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar) for bacterial binding to HL-60 cells. This contrasts with the Ca2+-dependent binding of selectins to PSGL-1 and other sLex-capped glycoconjugates (11Vestweber D. Blanks J.E. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 181-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (821) Google Scholar, 12McEver R.P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2002; 14: 581-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (350) Google Scholar). Labeled A. phagocytophilum also bound specifically to 2-GP-6-coupled microspheres (Fig. 2E), demonstrating that binding does not require tyrosine sulfation of PSGL-1. This contrasts sharply with the importance of tyrosine sulfation of PSGL-1 for optimal binding to P-selectin (38Wilkins P.P. Moore K.L. McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22677-22680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 39Pouyani T. Seed B.

Cell. 1995; 83: 323-331Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The bacteria did not bind to microspheres coated with 2-GSP-1 (Fig. 2F). Thus, the O-glycan component of the PSGL-1-derived glycopeptide is essential for binding. Bacteria fixed with Saccomanno, which does not cross-link proteins, also bound specifically to microspheres coated with sPSGL-1, 2-GSP-6, or 2-GP-6 (data not shown). This indicates that binding was not an artifact because of a specific method of fixation. A. phagocytophilum Binding to a PSGL-1-derived Glycopeptide Requires α1–3-linked Fucose on the O-glycan—Binding of A. phagocytophilum to both human and murine leukocytes correlates with expression of α1–3-fucosyltransferases, suggesting that binding requires α1–3-fucosylation of cell-surface glycans (25Goodman J.L. Nelson C.M. Klein M.B. Hayes S.F. Weston B.W. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 407-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 26Herron M.J. Nelson C.M. Larson J. Snapp K.R. Kansas G.S. Goodman J.L.

(2003) Blood, in pressGoogle Scholar). To directly address the contribution of α1–3-linked fucose, we compared bacterial binding to 2-GP-6 with that to 4-GP-5, which lacks an α1–3-linked fucose on the core-2 O-glycan (Fig. 3A). Because 4-GP-5 has a C-terminal methionine rather than a cysteine, we coupled 4-GP-5 and 2-GP-6 through their N-terminal free amino groups to carboxylated microspheres at matched densities (Fig. 3B). Labeled A. phagocytophilum bound specifically to N-terminal-coupled 2-GP-6 (Fig. 3C). This closely resembled binding to C-terminal-coupled 2-GP-6 (see Fig. 2E), indicating that the orientation of the 2-GP-6 on the microspheres did not affect bacterial recognition. In contrast, A. phagocytophilum did not bind to 4-GP-5-coupled microspheres (Fig. 3C). These data demonstrate that an α1–3-linked fucose residue is an essential recognition determinant for A. phagocytophilum. A. phagocytophilum Binding to a PSGL-1-derived Glycopeptide Does Not Require a Specific Orientation of sLex on the O-glycan—P-selectin binds in a stereospecific manner to the N-terminal region of human PSGL-1, as dramatically demonstrated by its inability to bind to an isomeric glycosulfopeptide that presents sLex on an extended core-1 O-glycan rather than on a branched core-2 O-glycan (21Leppänen A. White S.P. Helin J. McEver R.P. Cummings R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 39569-39578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). We measured A. phagocytophilum binding to two isomeric PSGL-1-derived glycopeptides, 1-GP-6, bearing a core-2 O-glycan, and 1-GP-6′, bearing an extended core-1 O-glycan (Fig. 4A). The glycopeptides were N-terminally coupled to microspheres at matched densities (Fig. 4B). Labeled A. phagocytophilum bound equivalently to both microspheres (Fig. 4C). The anti-PSGL-1 mAb PL1 blocked binding to both microspheres, confirming the specificity of binding (data not shown). Furthermore, sialidase treatment of microspheres eliminated A. phagocytophilum binding (Fig. 4C). These data confirm that binding requires sialylation, as well as fucosylation of the glycan. They further demonstrate that bacterial binding, unlike P-selectin binding, does not require a specific orientation of the glycan on the PSGL-1-derived pep"
https://openalex.org/W2166609325,"Che-1 is a recently identified human RNA polymerase II binding protein involved in the regulation of gene transcription and cell proliferation. We previously demonstrated that Che-1 inhibits the Rb growth-suppressing function by interfering with Rb-mediated HDAC1 recruitment on E2F target gene promoters. By hybridization of cancer profile arrays, we found that Che-1 expression is strongly down-regulated in several tumors, including colon and kidney carcinomas, compared with the relative normal tissues. Consistent with these data, Che-1 overexpression inhibits proliferation of HCT116 and LoVo human colon carcinoma cell lines by activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF1/Cip1 in a p53-independent manner and by promoting growth arrest at the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Che-1 activates p21WAF1/Cip1 by displacing histone deacetylase (HDAC)1 from the Sp1 binding sites of the p21WAF1/Cip1 gene promoter and accumulating acetylated histone H3 on these sites. Accordingly, Che-1-specific RNA interference negatively affects p21WAF1/Cip1 transactivation and increases cell proliferation in HCT116 cells. Taken together, our results indicate that Che-1 can be considered a general HDAC1 competitor and its down-regulation is involved in colon carcinoma cell proliferation."
https://openalex.org/W2002805916,"The glycoprotein VI (GPVI)·Fc receptor γ-chain (FcRγ-chain) complex is the major activation receptor for collagen on platelets. GPVI cross-linking mediates activation through tyrosine phosphorylation of an ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif) in the FcR γ-chain by Src family kinases. It has been previously shown that a transmembrane arginine and the cytoplasmic domain of GPVI are required for association with the FcR γ-chain in immortalized cell lines. In this study, we have delineated the regions in the GPVI tail that promote binding to FcR γ-chain and mediate functional responses to the snake venom convulxin by reconstitution of mutant forms of GPVI in RBL-2H3 cells. Sequential truncation of the cytoplasmic tail of GPVI revealed a major role for the basic region and a minor role for the juxtamembrane six amino acids in the association with FcR γ-chain and functional responses to convulxin. Analysis of selective deletions in the GPVI tail supported this conclusion. In addition, we show that the proline-rich domain is required for optimal Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, whereas it is dispensable for FcR γ-chain association."
https://openalex.org/W2023531893,"In the present study we demonstrate that ricin, apparently without passing through the Golgi apparatus, reaches the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and intoxicates cells in which the Golgi apparatus has been vesiculated by depletion of ϵ-COP, a subunit of COPI. LdlF cells contain a temperature-sensitive mutation in ϵ-COP. At the nonpermissive temperature ϵ-COP is degraded, and the Golgi apparatus undergoes a morphological change. To study ricin transport in these cells we used ricin sulf-2, a modified ricin molecule containing glycosylation and sulfation sites. Measurements of the incorporation of radioactive mannose into ricin sulf-2 showed that ricin reached the ER in cells depleted of ϵ-COP. Importantly, by investigating the glycosylation of ricin sulf-2 that was modified with radioactive sulfate in the trans-Golgi network, it was demonstrated that transport of ricin to the ER via the Golgi apparatus was severely inhibited. Moreover, we found that ricin was able to intoxicate ldlF cells depleted of ϵ-COP in the presence of brefeldin A. In contrast, control cells were completely protected against ricin by brefeldin A.

The plant toxin ricin consists of two polypeptide chains (A and B) linked by a disulfide bond. Ricin binds to both glycolipids and glycoproteins with terminal galactose via its B-chain and can therefore serve as a membrane marker. From the endosomal compartment ricin is partly recycled to the cell surface, partly degraded in the lysosomes, and partly transported to the Golgi apparatus and the ER (1Sandvig K. van Deurs B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 2Sandvig K. Grimmer S. Lauvrak S.U. Torgersen M.L. Skretting G. van Deurs B. Iversen T.G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 117: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). From the ER ricin is translocated to the cytosol where the A-chain inhibits protein synthesis. Coat proteins regulate membrane traffic and may be involved in one or several steps in ricin trafficking (3Kirchhausen T. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell.

In this study we have investigated the role of an intact COPI coat for ricin trafficking. The COPI coat has been reported to be involved in transport between the Golgi cisternae, the Golgi apparatus and the ER, early and late endosomes, and the endosomal compartment and the Golgi apparatus (5Lowe M.

One way to interfere with coat assembly is to use the fungal metabolite brefeldin A (BFA), which inhibits the binding of COPI to membranes (12Donaldson J.G. Finazzi D. Klausner R.D. Nature. 1992; 360: 350-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (595) Google Scholar). As a consequence of this inhibition, the Golgi stacks disassemble and redistribute into the ER (13Doms R.W. Russ G. Yewdell J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 14Lippincott-Schwartz J. Donaldson J.G. Schweizer A. Berger E.G. Hauri H.P. Yuan L.C. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1990; 60: 821-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). Endocytosis of ricin and its transport to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) is unchanged in the presence of BFA (15Sandvig K. Prydz K. Hansen S.H. van Deurs B. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 971-981Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). However, BFA protects against ricin in cells with a BFA-sensitive Golgi apparatus (15Sandvig K. Prydz K.

Cell Res. 1991; 192: 389-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The protective effect of BFA against ricin toxicity might be due to a requirement of COPI for the transport of ricin from the TGN to the ER, or it might be caused by the redistribution of the Golgi stacks into the ER. Another way to investigate the involvement of COPI in trafficking is to use the CHO-derived mutant cell line ldlF (17Hobbie L. Fisher A.S. Lee S. Flint A. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20958-20970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Aniento F. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1183-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 19Guo Q. Vasile E. Krieger M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1213-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). It was recently reported that ricin can intoxicate ldlF cells depleted of ϵ-COP, and it was suggested that intoxication takes place after retrograde transport of ricin from the Golgi apparatus to the ER and to the cytosol (20Chen A. Hu T. Mikoryak C. Draper R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1589: 124-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To investigate the various steps of ricin transport in cells depleted of ϵ-COP, we have measured the incorporation of radioactive sulfate and radioactive mannose into a modified ricin molecule containing sulfation and glycosylation sites in ldlF cells lacking ϵ-COP. Interestingly, our results suggest that ricin is transported to the ER from the endosomal compartment by a novel mechanism bypassing the Golgi apparatus. Materials—Ricin, ricin B-chain, bafilomycin A1, Hepes, fetal bovine serum, nocodazole, methyl-β-cyclodextrin, cytochalasin D, and lactose were obtained from Sigma. Na235SO4 was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. Na125I was obtained from DuPont. [3H]Mannose and [3H]leucine were from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Brefeldin A was obtained from Epicenter Technologies (Madison, WI). Ricin was labeled by the iodogen method (21Fraker P.J. Speck Jr., J.C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1978; 80: 849-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (3626) Google Scholar) to a specific activity of 30,000–40,000 cpm/ng. Cells and Cell Culture—Wild type CHO and the temperature-sensitive mutant ldlF cells were kindly provided by Dr. Monty Krieger (Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA) and cultured as previously described (19Guo Q. Vasile E. Krieger M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1213-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The cells were maintained in Ham's F-12 medium (Bio-Whittaker, Verviers, Belgium) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 2 mml-glutamine at 34 °C (permissive temperature), and shifted or not to 40 °C (nonpermissive temperature) overnight before running the experiments. Measurements of Endocytosis and Degradation—Endocytosed ricin was measured as the amount of 125I-labeled toxin that could not be removed by incubating the cells with a 0.1 m lactose solution for 5 min at 37 °C. The degradation of 125I-labeled ricin was measured as the amount of radioactivity that could not be precipitated by trichloroacetic acid after 4 h (22Sandvig K. Olsnes S. Exp. Cell Res. 1979; 121: 15-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Measurements of Protein Synthesis—The cells were incubated in medium without leucine in the presence of 2 μCi/ml [3H]leucine for 20 min at 37 °C. The medium was then removed and the cells were washed twice with 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid for 10 min. Finally, the cells were solubilized in KOH (0.1 m) and the acid-precipitable radioactivity was measured. The results are expressed in percent of [3H]leucine incorporated in cells incubated without toxin. Deviations between duplicates did not vary by more than 10%. Sulfation and Mannosylation of Ricin Sulf-2—Ricin A-chain sulf-2 containing a sulfation site and three partially overlapping N-glycosylation sites in the carboxyl terminus was produced, purified, and reconstituted with ricin B-chain to form ricin sulf-2 as previously described (23Rapak A. Falnes P.Ø. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The cells were incubated with 600 μCi/ml Na35SO4 in DMEM without sulfate or with 70 μCi/ml [3H]mannose in DMEM without glucose (Invitrogen). 30 min later ricin sulf-2 (∼500 ng/ml) was added, and the incubation was continued for6hat37 °Corfor4hand then 4 h in the absence of ricin and radioactive sulfate. The cells were then washed with a 0.1 m lactose solution at 37 °C and once with cold phosphate-buffered saline, lyzed (lysis buffer: 0.1 m NaCl, 10 mm Na2HPO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, pH 7.4) in the presence of a protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Diagnostics), and centrifuged to remove the nuclei for 10 min at 5000 rpm in an Eppendorf centrifuge (model 5415). The supernatant was immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-ricin antibodies immobilized on protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Biosciences). Finally, the beads were washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.35% Triton X-100, and the adsorbed material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12%) under reducing conditions. The radioactivity in the cell lysates was measured to detect differences in the total amount of isotope incorporated in the different conditions. SDS-PAGE—SDS-PAGE was done as described by Laemmli (24Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207218) Google Scholar). The gels were fixed in 4% acetic acid and 27% methanol for 30 min and then treated with 1 m sodium-salicylate (pH 5.8) in 2% glycerol for 15 min. Dried gels were exposed to Kodak XAR-5 films (Rochester, NY) at –80 °C or to phosphor screens (Amersham Biosciences). Ricin Intoxicates Cells Lacking ϵ-COP by a BFA-resistant Mechanism—Intoxication with ricin normally requires ricin endocytosis and transport from the endosomes to the Golgi apparatus and then to the ER, from where the toxin is translocated to the cytosol and then inhibits protein synthesis (1Sandvig K. van Deurs B. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 2002; 18: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 2Sandvig K. Grimmer S. Lauvrak S.U. Torgersen M.L. Skretting G. van Deurs B. Iversen T.G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 117: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). In ldlF cells incubated at the nonpermissive temperature (40 °C) ϵ-COP is degraded and COPI function is impaired. It has previously been shown (9Gu F. Aniento F. Parton R.G. Gruenberg J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1183-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 10Daro E. Sheff D. Gomez M. Kreis T. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1747-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) that in these cells endocytosis continues but that the transport from late endosomes to lysosomes is impaired. In agreement with these results, the endocytosis of ricin continues in ldlF cells at the nonpermissive temperature (data not shown), but ricin degradation is severely reduced (Fig. 1). As a consequence of impaired COPI function, the Golgi apparatus is partially redistributed into an ER-like structure and partially into patch-like structures (19Guo Q. Vasile E. Krieger M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1213-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 25Gomez M. Scales S.J. Kreis T.E. Perez F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29162-29169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Importantly, as in many other cell lines (13Doms R.W. Russ G. Yewdell J.W. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 61-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 14Lippincott-Schwartz J. Donaldson J.G. Schweizer A. Berger E.G. Hauri H.P. Yuan L.C. Klausner R.D. Cell. 1990; 60: 821-836Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar), BFA causes the redistribution of the Golgi into the ER in ldlF cells depleted of ϵ-COP (25Gomez M. Scales S.J. Kreis T.E. Perez F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29162-29169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To investigate whether ricin was able to reach the cytosol and intoxicate ldlF cells at the nonpermissive temperature both in the absence and in the presence of BFA, we measured the ability of ricin to inhibit protein synthesis both in the absence and in the presence of this drug. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 2A, ricin was able to intoxicate ldlF cells grown at the nonpermissive temperature (40 °C) in the presence of BFA, although at a lower extent compared with untreated cells. However, BFA severely inhibited the intoxication of ricin in CHO cells grown at 40 °C (Fig. 2B). Because the delivery of ricin to lysosomes is strongly inhibited in ldlF cells grown at the nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 1), a toxicity experiment was also performed in the presence of bafilomycin A1, which will inhibit transport to lysosomes and degradation. Importantly, also in the presence of bafilomycin A1, ldlF cells and CHO cells grown at the nonpermissive temperature respond differently to BFA (Fig. 2, C and D), thus suggesting that the fact that ricin can intoxicate ldlF cells grown at the nonpermissive temperature in the presence of BFA is not due to the inhibition of ricin degradation and the higher intracellular amount of ricin that these cells may have. It should also be noticed that a similar concentration of ricin was required to intoxicate ldlF cells and CHO cells in the presence of bafilomycin A1 (Fig. 2, C versus D, without BFA), thus suggesting that the differences in ricin toxicity between ldlF cells and CHO cells (Fig. 2, A versus B, without BFA) may be due to the larger amount of ricin that is degraded in CHO cells. Finally, in some experiments the effect of BFA on ricin toxicity in ldlF cells grown overnight at the permissive (34 °C) or at the nonpermissive temperature (40 °C) was compared. Because many transport steps are temperature-sensitive these experiments were performed at 37 °C after testing that COPI remains unfunctional at the end of the experiment in ldlF cells incubated overnight at 40 °C (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 2, E and F, in the presence of BFA ricin intoxicates ldlF cells lacking ϵ-COP (preincubated at 40 °C), but not control ldlF cells (preincubated at 34 °C). In conclusion, these experiments suggest that in ldlF cells lacking ϵ-COP ricin may reach the cytosol bypassing the Golgi apparatus, and that neither incubation of cells (CHO) at 40 °C nor inhibition of lysosomal degradation are sufficient to induce a BFA-resistant intoxication pathway. Ricin Is Transported to the ER in LdlF Cells Lacking ϵ-COP Bypassing the Golgi Apparatus—The previous toxicity experiments suggest that ricin enters the cytosol of ldlF cells lacking ϵ-COP by a different mechanism than in other cells. To investigate the routing of ricin in ldlF cells lacking ϵ-COP we used ricin sulf-2, a modified ricin molecule containing a tyrosine sulfation site and three partially overlapping N-glycosylation sites at the carboxyl terminus of the A-chain (23Rapak A. Falnes P.Ø. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Ricin sulf-2 has previously been used to monitor the transport of the toxin to the TGN (site of sulfation (26Baeuerle P.A. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2655-2664Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar)) and to the ER (site of glycosylation). To investigate whether ricin reached the ER in ldlF cells depleted of ϵ-COP, we measured the glycosylation of ricin sulf-2 by directly quantifying the incorporation of [3H]mannose into the toxin molecule. It has previously been shown (17Hobbie L. Fisher A.S. Lee S. Flint A. Krieger M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20958-20970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that several ER-associated reactions, including addition of high mannose N-linked oligosaccharides, occur normally in cells lacking ϵ-COP. Interestingly, ricin sulf-2 labeled with [3H]mannose was detected in control ldlF cells (preincubated at 34 °C) and in ldlF cells lacking ϵ-COP (preincubated at 40 °C) (Fig. 3A), although the amount of labeled ricin in ldlF cells lacking ϵ-COP was reduced by ∼30% (Fig. 3B). This experiment shows that ricin can reach the ER in ldlF cells lacking ϵ-COP. Furthermore, to test the hypothesis that ricin is transported to the ER and to the cytosol bypassing the Golgi apparatus, ldlF cells were incubated with ricin sulf-2 in the presence of radioactive sulfate. When ricin sulf-2 was added to control ldlF cells (preincubated at 34 °C) in the presence of radioactive sulfate and immunoprecipitated from cell lysates, two main labeled bands were visible (Fig. 3C, left lane, the two upper bands). It has previously been shown (23Rapak A. Falnes P.Ø. Olsnes S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1997; 94: 3783-3788Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) in other cells lines that the band with the lowest molecular weight of these two bands represents ricin that has been sulfated in the TGN, and the band with the highest molecular weight of these two represents ricin that has been both sulfated in the TGN and glycosylated in the ER. This seems also to be the case in control ldlF cells because only the band with the highest molecular weight was observed when ricin-sulf 2 and radioactive sulfate was removed from the medium after 4 h, and the incubation was continued for 4 h more to allow sulfated ricin to be transported to the ER and be glycosylated (data not shown). In some experiments a third labeled band with a lower molecular weight was observed (Fig. 3C, lowest band), this band probably being a degradation product. Interestingly, we found that ricin sulf-2 also was sulfated in ldlF cells preincubated at the nonpermissive temperature (40 °C) (Fig. 3C) although to a lower extent (∼5-fold reduction) (in Fig. 3C, lane 34 °C and lane 40 °C show different film exposures). The molecular weight of the band corresponding to sulfated ricin was slightly different in cells preincubated at 34 °C and 40 °C (compare middle band in Fig. 3C). Interestingly, whereas in control cells (ldlF cells preincubated at the permissive temperature) ∼45% of the total amount of sulfated ricin was transported to the ER (Fig. 3D), only minimal amounts of ricin sulf-2, which was both sulfated and glycosylated, were observed in ldlF cells preincubated at the nonpermissive temperature (Fig. 3C, 40 °C), thus suggesting that the transport of ricin from the Golgi apparatus to the ER is severely inhibited in ldlF cells lacking ϵ-COP and supporting the idea that ricin is able to reach the ER and intoxicate these cells bypassing the Golgi apparatus. Characterization of Ricin Trafficking in ϵ-COP-deficient Cells—It has previously been shown that ricin is internalized but does not intoxicate cells at 17 °C. To investigate whether this was the case also in ldlF cells lacking ϵ-COP, a toxicity experiment was performed at 17 °C with ldlF cells preincubated at the permissive or at the nonpermissive temperature. As shown in Fig. 4A, neither control ldlF cells grown at the permissive temperature (34 °C) nor ldlF cells grown at the nonpermissive temperature (40 °C) were intoxicated with ricin at 17 °C, thus indicating that the transport of ricin to the ER in cells lacking ϵ-COP also requires a temperature-sensitive step. In addition, COPI or another BFA-sensitive coat may be involved in the induction of the BFA-insensitive pathway in ldlF cells depleted of ϵ-COP because when BFA was present during the overnight incubation of ldlF cells at 40 °C as well as during the toxicity experiment, ricin was no longer able to intoxicate ldlF cells lacking ϵ-COP (Fig. 4B). Direct trafficking from a specialized endosomal compartment (caveosome) to the ER was recently demonstrated for simian virus 40 (27Pelkmans L. Kartenbeck J. Helenius A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). This transport step was reported to be dependent on microtubules, and we therefore tested whether ricin intoxication in ldlF cells lacking ϵ-COP could be inhibited by nocodazole. As shown in Fig. 5, neither disruption of microtubules with nocodazole (16 μm), nor of the actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin D (1 μm), affected the toxicity of ricin in ldlF cells depleted of ϵ-COP. Because it has previously been found that cholesterol is important for ricin trafficking (2Sandvig K. Grimmer S. Lauvrak S.U. Torgersen M.L. Skretting G. van Deurs B. Iversen T.G. Histochem. Cell Biol. 2002; 117: 131-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 28Grimmer S. Iversen T.G. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 4205-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), we also investigated whether depletion of cholesterol would affect ricin toxicity in ldlF cells. As shown in Fig. 5C, reduction of membrane cholesterol by addition of methyl-β-cyclodextrin (2.5 mm) slightly increased the toxicity of ricin in control ldlF cells (34 °C), but decreased the toxicity of the toxin in ldlF cells lacking ϵ-COP (40 °C). The most important finding of this study is that the toxin ricin seems to be transported to the ER and to the cytosol bypassing the Golgi apparatus in ldlF cells lacking ϵ-COP (Fig. 6). In ldlF cells lacking ϵ-COP after incubation at the nonpermissive temperature (40 °C), the function of COPI is impaired and the Golgi apparatus is disrupted (19Guo Q. Vasile E. Krieger M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1213-1224Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, ricin is transported to the ER and intoxicates these cells. Under normal conditions ricin intoxicates cells after being transported from the endosomal compartment to the Golgi apparatus, and then to the ER. However, our experiments indicate that ricin can be transported to the ER by an alternative mechanism in ldlF cells lacking ϵ-COP. As shown, the transport of ricin from the Golgi apparatus to the ER (revealed by studies of sulfate-labeled ricin) is severely inhibited in ldlF cells lacking ϵ-COP. Secondly, BFA only inhibits the toxicity of ricin to some extent in ldlF cells lacking ϵ-COP (incubated at the nonpermissive temperature, 40 °C), but completely in control ldlF cells (incubated at the permissive temperature, 34 °C). These results cannot be explained by a lack of effect of BFA on the Golgi structure because it has previously been shown that BFA causes the redistribution of the disturbed Golgi apparatus into the ER in ldlF cell depleted of ϵ-COP (25Gomez M. Scales S.J. Kreis T.E. Perez F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 29162-29169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Importantly, the difference in toxicity in the presence of BFA in ldlF cells and CHO cells at the nonpermissive temperature is not caused by the higher intracellular amount of ricin in the ldlF cells because a similar difference was observed when the experiment was performed in the presence of bafilomycin A1. It is not clear at the moment why the toxicity of ricin is inhibited to some extent by BFA in ldlF cells depleted of ϵ-COP. The possibility exists that there is more than one transport route from the endosomal compartment to the ER under these conditions and that only one is sensitive to BFA, or it could be that there is one pathway that is only partially sensitive to inhibition by BFA. However, it is unlikely that the inhibition of toxicity by BFA reflects an effect of the drug on the transport of ricin passing through the vesiculated Golgi, because there is only a very small fraction of sulfated ricin that is transported from the TGN (sulfation site) to the ER and glycosylated. It was recently reported that ricin-intoxication of ldlF cells transfected with cDNA encoding wild type ϵ-COP at 40 °C is only partially sensitive to BFA (20Chen A. Hu T. Mikoryak C. Draper R.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1589: 124-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). It is not clear why BFA did not completely inhibit the toxicity of ricin in ldlF cells transfected with wild-type ϵ-COP at 40 °C, but it is possible that there is still an effect of the temperature-sensitive form of ϵ-COP in these cells. A changed conformation or the degradation of the temperature-sensitive protein might still affect the cells. It has been shown that the simian virus 40 is directly transported to the ER from non-classical endosomes termed caveosomes, and that this process requires intact microtubuli (27Pelkmans L. Kartenbeck J. Helenius A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 473-483Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Unlike the simian virus 40, transport of ricin to the cytosol does not require microtubuli, suggesting that caveosomes are not involved in ricin transport to the ER in ldlF cells lacking ϵ-COP. Recent data indicate that ricin is transported to the Golgi apparatus from the early/recycling compartment (29Iversen T.G. Skretting G. Llorente A. Nicoziani P. van Deurs B. Sandvig K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2001; 12: 2099-2107Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). In agreement with this idea we show here that ricin can intoxicate ldlF cells depleted of ϵ-COP, where the transport from early to late endosomes is inhibited (10Daro E. Sheff D. Gomez M. Kreis T. Mellman I. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 1747-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Altogether our experiments suggest that ricin intoxicates ldlF cells lacking ϵ-COP by using an alternative pathway that bypasses the Golgi apparatus.

https://openalex.org/W1975166375,"Plakoglobin provides a key linkage in protein chains that connect desmosomal and classical cadherins to the cytoskeleton. It is also present in a significant cytosolic pool that has the capacity to impact on canonical Wnt signaling by competing for interaction with partner proteins of β-catenin. The closely related protein, β-catenin, is rapidly targeted for proteasomal degradation by phosphorylation of a “destruction box” within the N-terminal domain. Inhibition of this process forms the basis of Wnt signaling. This destruction box is also found in the N-terminal domain of plakoglobin. We report that plakoglobin is modified by the addition of O-GlcNAc at a single site in close proximity to the destruction box. O-GlcNAc modification has been proposed to counteract phosphorylation, provide protection from proteasomal degradation, mediate signal transduction, silence transcription, and regulate multimolecular protein assembly. This finding has potential implications for understanding the roles of plakoglobin.

Its essential role in the maintenance of tissue integrity is revealed in the phenotypes of mice and humans with compromised plakoglobin activity. Most plakoglobin null mice die around embryonic day 15 (E15) with ruptured hearts and, those that survive longer (E18) show severe epidermal blistering and sloughing (4Ruiz P. Brinkmann V.

In epithelial adherens junctions it connects classical cadherins to actin filaments via α-catenin. In the rare complexus adhaerentes junctions of endothelial cells it binds VE-cadherin to intermediate filaments via desmoplakins I and II (7Knudsen K.A. Wheelock M.J. J.

In desmosomes it engages in multiple lateral and vertical protein complexes: connecting desmogleins to the N termini of desmoplakin I and II, binding to the C terminus of desmocollin a, and associating with plakophilins, to promote cytoskeletal tethering and the lateral clustering of desmosomal cadherins (9Mathur M.

However, little is understood about factors that regulate the selective assembly of these protein complexes. In the closely related protein, β-catenin, phosphorylation plays a critical role. Phosphorylations of the β-catenin ARM repeat domain decrease its positive charge leading to partner repulsion. Conversely, phosphorylation of partner proteins enhances their negative charge and promotes interaction (20Roura S. Miravet S. Piedra J. Garcia de Herreros A. Dunach M. J. Biol.

Although most partner proteins interact with the central ARM repeat domain, the N-terminal domain of plakoglobin participates in binding α-catenin and promotes desmoglein association (11Witcher L.

C-terminal domains of plakoglobin, β-catenin, and, their fly counterpart, Armadillo, interact with their respective N-terminal domains and/or ARM repeats and thus provide additional regulatory mechanisms by occupying and/or occluding the central binding groove (23Castano J.

Wnt inhibition of this phosphorylation cascade prevents subsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of cytosolic β-catenin.

The N- and C-terminal domains of plakoglobin and β-catenin are extremely divergent, but the destruction box is found in both proteins (see Fig. 6). Plakoglobin is up-regulated by Wnt-1 and has the capacity to impinge on β-catenin signaling by binding to and competitively sequestering elements of the degradation machinery and Tcf/Lef transcriptional partner proteins (27Bradley R.S.

Given the presence of this destruction box within the plakoglobin N-terminal domain and the critical role played by this region in the formation of several junctional protein complexes, an understanding of its post-translational modification is likely to be central to comprehending the cellular roles of this protein. In seeking to explore these issues, we discovered a site for O-GlcNAcylation on the N terminus of plakoglobin that lies intriguingly close to the destruction box. This modification has the potential to add an additional level of control to the protein stability, junctional and cytoskeletal assembly, and signaling and transcriptional activity of plakoglobin (52Vosseller K. Sakabe K. Wells L. Hart G.W. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Constructs—The following myc-tagged plakoglobin constructs in the p163/7 vector (53Niehrs C. Huttner W.B. Ruther U. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 15938-15942Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have been described previously ΔN, ΔN-2, ΔN-6, ΔN-9, Δ3-C, Δ1-C, ΔN80, (Fig. 1) (38Charpentier E. Lavker R. Acquista E.

ΔN32 and ΔN40 encoding FLAG-tagged mutants deleted in the N-terminal 32 and 40 amino acids, respectively, were generated as described for the full-length FLAG-tagged plakoglobin (PG) 2The abbreviations used are: PG, plakoglobin; Gal-T, galactosyl-transferase; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; GSK-3β, glycogen synthase kinase-3β. (38Charpentier E. Lavker R. Acquista E. Cowin P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 503-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) by substituting FLAG-ΔN32F and FLAG-ΔN40F as the forward oligos. To generate serine/threonine, Ser/Thr, point mutants, complementary forward and reverse 24-base primers were designed comprising sequence flanking a three-base mutation converting Ser/Thr codons to alanine (Ala) (Table I). Two sets of PCR reactions were done using 50 ng of hPG Ca 2.1, GenBank™ number Z68228 (55Franke W.W. Goldschmidt M.D. Zimblemann R. Mueller H.M. Schiller D.L. Cowin P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 4027-4031Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), as template and standard PCR conditions to generate overlapping fragments of plakoglobin that spanned and incorporated each mutant codon. These fragments were generated using either forward primer FLAG-120F, comprising a 3-base spacer, EcoRI restriction site, Kozak's sequence, sequence encoding the FLAG epitope (MDYKDDDDK), and 18 bases of sequence encoding amino acids 2–7 of plakoglobin or, a reverse primer 489R, comprising a 3-bp spacer, EcoRI site, a stop codon, and 21 bases of plakoglobin together with appropriate mutant primers. The clone in which all six Ser/Thr codons are mutated to Ala was generated in a similar fashion using longer oligos spanning four of the six mutant codons in each direction and overlapping centrally for two of these. These PCR fragments were blunted with T4 polymerase to remove the 3′ adenosine bases added during the PCR reaction. 1 μl of the PCR for each half-mutant was placed in a third PCR and used as overlapping templates with forward and reverse primers, TagF and TagR, to amplify the entire head domain containing the individual mutations (Fig. 1). These mutants were cloned into the Eco site of the pCDNA3 vector. Cloning of full-length T14A mutant (PGT14A) was achieved by replacing the 1.3-kb StuI fragment derived from the internal plakoglobin StuI 179 site and the StuI 2070 site in the backbone of the vector pCDNA3 with the corresponding 3.3-kb StuI fragment derived from full-length plakoglobin in pCDNA3. A full-length S28A mutant (PGS28A) was generated using a similar strategy with the substitution of a reverse oligo 817R that spanned an internal Sph site at base 698 of hPG2.1 that permitted cloning of the final mutant product into the full-length plakoglobin cDNA. Each of the clones described above were cloned into the EcoRI site of pCDNA3. All mutants were fully sequenced and contained no mutations besides those deliberately engineered into these clones. pCS2-Xenopus β-catenin was a kind gift of Barry Gumbiner (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA).Table IOligonucleotides used to create deletion and mutant forms of plakoglobin by PCRForwardFlag ΔN32FcttgaattcgccgccATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGTGCGTGCCCTCCGTCAGCAGCAAGFlag ΔN40FcttgaattcgccgccATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGGGCATCATGGAGGAGGATGFlag120FccggaattcgccgccATGGACTACAAGGACGACGATGACAAGATGGAGGTGATGAACCTGTagFtccgaattcgccgccATGGACTAT14A-FCAAGGTGGCTGAGTGGCAGCAGACAT19A-FGCAGCAGGCATACACCTACGACTCGT21A-FGACATACGCCTACGACTCGGGTATCS24A-FCTACGACGCGGGTATCCACTCGGGCS28A-FGACTCGGGTATCCACGCCGGCGCCAACACCTGCT32A-FCGCCAACGCCTGCGTGCCCTCCGTC6 mut-FCGCCTACGACGCGGGTATCCACGCGGGCGCCAACGCCTGCGTGCCCTCCGTCAGCAGCReverse489RccggaattcCTAGAGCAGCTGGGACGGCTC817RGCTGAGCATGCGACCAGAGC389RCTCGAATTCCTAGCACATGGCCTCCCGTagRctctctagaccggaattcCTAGAGCAGT14A-RGCCACTCAGCCACCTTGATAGGCTGT19A-RAGGTGTATGCCTGCTGCCACTCAGTT21A-RAGTCGTAGGCGTATGTCTGCTGCCAS24A-RGGATACCCGCGTCGTAGGTGTATGTS28A-RGCAGGTGTTGGCGCCGGCGTGGATACCCGAGTCT32A-RGCACGCAGGCGTTGGCGCCCGAGTG6 mut-RGATACCCGCGTCGTAGGCGTATGCCTGCTGCCACTCAGCCACCTTGATAGGCTGCTCC Open table in a new tab Cell Culture, Transfection, and Immunoprecipitation—For Gal-T experiments, 293T cells were transfected with 5 μg of each DNA construct by the standard calcium phosphate method. 36 h after transfection, cells were lysed in 200 μl of 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 3 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1% SDS, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm PMSF, sonicated twice for 15 s, and boiled for 5 min. SDS concentration was reduced to less than 0.2% by addition of 1 ml of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm PMSF.

For steady state metabolic labeling, 24 h after transfection the cells were incubated for 12 h in 1 ml of methionine/cysteine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% dialyzed fetal calf serum and 150 μCi/ml Tran35S-label labeling reagent (ICN Biomedicals Inc.). For pulse-chase experiments cells were labeled for 15 min with 500 μCi/ml Tran35S-label labeling reagent then rinsed and chased in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 20 mm methionine. Primary mouse keratinocytes were prepared and maintained as described (38Charpentier E. Lavker R. Acquista E. Cowin P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 503-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Human HaCaT keratinocytes were maintained in KGM (Clonetics, Walkerville, MD) (56Boukamp P. Petrussevska R.T. Breitkreutz D. Hornung J. Markham A. Fusenig N.E. J.

Plakoglobin and β-catenin were immunoprecipitated from 100-mm dishes of cultured cells or from 50 30-μm cryosections of bovine snout epidermal tissue. These cells and tissue sources were lysed and processed as described above. Cell Fractionation—Snout proteins were extracted sequentially in 1 ml of saponin buffer (0.01% saponin, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 5mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF, and 10 μg of aprotinin), followed by 1 ml of Triton X-100 buffer (1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm PMSF, and 10 μg of aprotinin) and then 200 μl of SDS buffer (1% SDS, 25 mm Tris, 3 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin). Extracts were centrifuged for 2 h at 100,000 × g. Equal amounts of plakoglobin were adjusted to a final volume of 2 ml in buffer containing SDS at a final concentration of 0.1% and Triton X-100 at 1% prior to immunoprecipitation. Galactosyltransferase (Gal-T) Labeling—Galactosyltransferase labeling and PNGase F analysis were carried out essentially as described (57Haltiwanger R.S. Philipsberg G.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8752-8758Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). After immunoprecipitation, beads were washed six times in wash buffer (15 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 1 m NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100) and twice in Tris-buffered saline, pelleted beads were resuspended in 500 μl of galactosyltransferase labeling buffer (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 5 mm MnCl2,10mm galactose, 2% Triton X-100). The labeling was conducted under saturated conditions for galactosyltransferase (50 milliunits, Sigma) and UDP-[6-3H]galactose (2 μCi, American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) at 37 °C for 1 h. After labeling, the beads were washed twice with Tris-buffered saline to remove unincorporated radiolabel prior to analysis by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Alkali-induced β-elimination was performed as described by Roquemore et al. (63Roquemore E.P. Chou T.Y. Hart G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 443-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Briefly, after labeling and SDS-PAGE analysis, the radioactive band corresponding to plakoglobin was cut from the gel, rinsed in water, and incubated in β-elimination buffer (1 mm NaBH4, 0.1 m NaOH) for 24 h at 37 °C. After 1 h on ice, the β-elimination reaction was stopped by addition of 4 m ice-cold acetic acid until the pH dropped down between 6 and 7. Released saccharides were desalted by passage over Dowex 50-X8 (H+ form) and subjected to size fractionation on a Superdex peptide fast protein liquid chromatography column (Amersham Biosciences). The column was chromatographed at 0.5 ml/min in Milli Q water and was calibrated with partially hydrolyzed dextran standards and detected using an in-line Rainin refractive index monitor. Plakoglobin Is Glycosylated—Plakoglobin and β-catenin share over 65% sequence identity within their central ARM domains but diverge considerably in the sequence of their N-terminal domains, with the exception of a series of highly conserved sites for phosphorylation by casein kinase I and GSK-3β (55Franke W.W.

During a sequence alignment of these regions, we noticed that plakoglobin, but not β-catenin, contained a sequence that is frequently modified by O-GlcNAcylation on many proteins (60Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 61Haltiwanger R.S. Holt G.D. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 2563-2568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 3www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/YinOYang. O-GlcNAc monosaccharide modifications occur in a large number of nucleocytoplasmic proteins. In vivo these sugars are dynamically transferred from UDP-GlcNAc, the final product of the hexosamine pathway, to serines and threonines by the enzyme O-GlcNAc transferase and removed by the actions of the essential enzyme O-GlcNA-case (52Vosseller K. Sakabe K. Wells L. Hart G.W. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 2002; 6: 851-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To determine whether plakoglobin and β-catenin contain O-GlcNAc moieties, we transfected 293T cells with full-length plakoglobin or β-catenin cDNAs, recovered the expressed proteins by immunoprecipitation, and performed the Gal-T assay (Fig. 2A). In this assay, Gal-T covalently labels protein-bound sugar by transferring a galactose (Gal) from UDP-[3H]Gal to any terminal non-reducing GlcNAc moiety/residues (60Haltiwanger R.S. Blomberg M.A. Hart G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9005-9013Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitates of plakoglobin were strongly labeled by the Gal-T assay (Fig. 2A, lane 1). No labeling was detected on immunoprecipitates from 293T cells expressing β-catenin (lane 3) or those transfected with empty vector (lane 2). We next tested if endogenous plakoglobin (Fig. 2B) and β-catenin (Fig. 2C) were glycosylated by performing a Gal-T assay on immunoprecipitates from bovine snout epidermis and a number of cell lines. Again, endogenous plakoglobin from snout epidermis was labeled (Fig. 2B), whereas β-catenin was not (Fig. 2C). However, β-catenin immunoprecipitated from human keratinocytes, MCF7 and A431 cells growing in vitro showed Gal-T labeling (Fig. 2C), whereas plakoglobin from cultured cell lines was not modified (Fig. 2B). Therefore, modification of plakoglobin and β-catenin appears to be dependent on the cell context. Epidermis has many layers of non-proliferating cells that contain a significant cytosolic fraction of plakoglobin (62Kapprell H.-P. Cowin P. Franke W.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 505-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Similarly 293T cells do not proliferate following transient transfection and the expressed plakoglobin is mostly cytoplasmic because of lack of cell junctions in this cell line (11Witcher L. Collins R. Puttagunta S. Mechanic S. Munson M. Gumbiner B. Cowin P. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10904-10909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In contrast, cultured keratinocytes, MCF-7, and A431 cells proliferate extensively and the majority of plakoglobin is localized at cell junctions (38Charpentier E. Lavker R. Acquista E. Cowin P. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 503-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Sequential fractionation of snout plakoglobin showed the presence of the modified form in cytosolic (saponin) cadherin-bound (Triton X-100) and, to a lesser extent, in junctional (SDS) extracts (Fig. 2D). Plakoglobin Contains O-Linked Single GlcNAc Residues— Positive labeling by Gal-T identifies the presence of both N- and O-linked GlcNAc modifications on proteins. N-Linked and O-linked glycosylation can be distinguished by β-elimination, a chemical method of deglycosylation that, under mild alkaline conditions, selectively releases O-linked oligosaccharides as alditols but retains N-linked sugars (63Roquemore E.P. Chou T.Y. Hart G.W. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 230: 443-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Plakoglobin immunoprecipitates were labeled by the Gal-T assay, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to autoradiography to confirm the presence of [3H]galactose on the GlcNAc modification. The Coomassie Blue band corresponding to the position of plakoglobin was excised and subjected to alkaline β-elimination. The 3H-labeled oligosaccharides released by this process were fractionated by chromatography. A single peak was observed that comigrated with the unlabeled disaccharide standard i"

Oxalate degradation was found to be performed successively by two enzymes, a formyl-CoA transferase (frc) and an oxalate decarboxylase (oxc). These two genes are present in several bacterial genomes including that of Escherichia coli. The frc ortholog in E. coli is yfdW, with which it shares 61% sequence identity. We have expressed the YfdW open reading frame product and solved its crystal structure in the apo-form and in complex with acetyl-CoA and with a mixture of acetyl-CoA and oxalate. YfdW exhibits a novel and spectacular fold in which two monomers assemble as interlaced rings, defining the CoA binding site at their interface. From the structure of the complex with acetyl-CoA and oxalate, we propose a putative formyl/oxalate transfer mechanism involving the conserved catalytic residue Asp169. The similarity of yfdW with bacterial orthologs (∼60% identity) and paralogs (∼20–30% identity) suggests that this new fold and parts of the CoA transfer mechanism are likely to be the hallmarks of a wide family of CoA transferases. Because of its toxicity, oxalate accumulation from amino acid catabolism leads to acute disorders in mammals.

Oxalate is a highly oxidized and toxic organic compound produced in the liver of mammals by amino acid catabolism. Its accumulation can be lethal in extreme cases, and lower accumulation levels lead to serious nonlethal pathologies such as hyperoxoluria, cardiomyopathy, cardiac conductance disorders, pyridoxine deficiency, calcium oxalate kidney stones, and renal failure (1Duncan S.H.

Dawson K.A. Mayberry W.R. Foss J.G. Arch. Microbiol. 1985; 141: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that the gut microorganisms, especially O. formigenes, maintain a transepithelial gradient of oxalate from the blood to the lumen of the intestines and consequently have an important symbiotic relationship with their hosts (6Doane L.A. Liebman M. Caldwell D.R. Nutr. Res. 1989; 9: 957-964Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The anaerobic mechanism of oxalate degradation involves, successively, an oxalate/formate antitransporter located in the cell membrane (7Anantharam V. Allison M.J. Maloney P.C. J. Biol.

In this pathway the oxalate has first to be coupled to coenzyme A, a reaction catalyzed by formyl-CoA transferase; and a second step involves the oxalyl-CoA decarboxylase, yielding CO2 and formyl-CoA.We have undertaken a structural genomics program aimed at solving the structures of Escherichia coli proteins of unknown function widespread among several Gram+ and Gram– bacteria (12Claverie J.-M. Monchois V. Audic S. Poirot O. Abergel C. Comb. Chem. High Throughput Screen. 2002; 5: 511-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 13Vincentelli R. Bignon C. Gruez A. Sulzenbacher G. Canaan S.

Two of our targets, the yfdW and yfdU open reading frames, are closely related to the two O. formigenes enzymes. The O. formigenes formyl-CoA transferase (frc) is the closest protein neighbor of YfdW that has a known function, with both proteins sharing 61% identity (Fig. 1). yfdW also shares 50–60% sequence identity with orthologs from various species, all of which probably share the same function. These comparisons indicate that besides specialized organisms such as O. formigenes, several bacteria, including E. coli, may participate in oxalate detoxification. Other bacteria have frc-like genes sharing lower sequence identity with yfdW and coding for different CoA transferases: (R)-benzylsuccinate-CoA transferase (23% identity), (R)-phenyllactate-CoA transferase of Clostridium difficile (25%), (R)-carnitine-CoA transferase (24%), a putative cholate-CoA transferase (27%), and 2-methylacyl-CoA racemase (25%). However, no three-dimensional structures are available for any of them.Here we report on the YfdW structure in the apo-form in complex with a surrogate ligand, acetyl-CoA (AcCoA), 1The abbreviations used are: AcCoA, acetyl CoA; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; ESRF, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility.1The abbreviations used are: AcCoA, acetyl CoA; r.m.s.d., root mean square deviation; ESRF, European Synchrotron Radiation Facility. and with both acetyl-CoA and the substrate, oxalate. The YfdW open reading frame product is a dimer displaying an amazing new fold of two interlaced rings, probably conserved among the orthologs and paralogs of the CoA transferase family. We have identified the formyl-CoA binding site as well as an oxalate resting site, and we propose a formate/oxalate transfer mechanism involving the catalytic nucleophile, Asp169. We believe that these features are hallmarks of a wide CoA transferase family.MATERIALS AND METHODSExpression and Purification—The subcloning and expression of the yfdW gene have already been described elsewhere (13Vincentelli R.

Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 2109-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In brief, the yfdW gene was amplified by PCR from E. coli K12 genomic DNA and was subcloned into the pDest17 vector by recombination using the Gateway technology (Invitrogen). Expression was carried out using the Tuner(DE3)pLysS E. coli strain. The protein was purified on a nickel column followed by gel filtration on a Superdex 200 column in Hepes, 5 mm, NaCl, 150 mm, pH 7.5. The selenomethionine-labeled protein was expressed by blocking the methionine biosynthesis pathway (15Doublie S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 523-530Crossref PubMed Scopus (791) Google Scholar) and was purified as described above.Crystallization—Crystals of the SeMet-labeled apo-protein were grown by mixing 1 μl of a protein solution at 11 mg/ml in 5 mm sodium-Hepes and 150 mm sodium chloride, with 500 nl of precipitant solution consisting of 0.9 m ammonium phosphate and 0.1 m sodium-Hepes, pH 7.5. Crystals grew within 8–15 days as rod-shaped prisms in the space group P212121 (Table I).

Open table in a new tab Crystals of the complex with AcCoA or with a mixture of AcCoA and oxalate were obtained by co-crystallization with 29% polyethylene glycol 600 as precipitant in 0.1 m cacodylate, pH 6.5. Crystals belong to the space group P62 and contain 72% solvent (V m = of 4.4 Å3/Da) with a dimer in the asymmetric unit.X-ray Structure Determination and Refinement—Selenomethione-labeled crystals were soaked in a solution containing the reservoir buffer and 27–30% (v/v) glycerol and were subsequently flash-frozen. An x-ray data set of the SeMet apo-protein was collected at 100 K on beamline BM14 (ESRF, Grenoble) at 1.8 Å resolution, whereas the binary and ternary complexes were collected at 2.0 and 2.2 Å resolution at ID14-EH4 and ID-29 (ESRF, Grenoble), respectively. Oscillation images were integrated, scaled, and merged using DENZO (16Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter Jr., C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology. Vol. 276. Academic Press, New, York1997: 307-326Google Scholar) and the CCP4 program suite (17Callaborative Computing Program Number 4 and Collaborative Computing Project for NMRActa Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar), which located 18 of the 22 selenium atom sites within the asymmetric unit and provided us with the initial phases. Solvent flattening was performed by RESOLVE (19Terwilliger T.C. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. Biol. Crystallogr. 2000; 56: 965-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (1631) Google Scholar) The good quality of the RESOLVE map made it possible to build 80% of the model automatically with wArp (20Perrakis A. Morris R. Lamzin V.S. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 458-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (2562) Google Scholar). This step was followed by manually building the missing parts of the protein with Turbo-Frodo (21Roussel A. Cambillau C. Silicon Graphics Geometry Partners Directory. Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991: 81Google Scholar) and by refinement with Refmac5 (22Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5027) Google Scholar) using the apo-protein dimer as a search model. The models were subjected to TLS/restraint refinements with Refmac5 (22Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13776) Google Scholar) in the ranges of 20.0 to 2.0 and 20.0 to 2.2 Å resolution, followed by manual rebuilding with Turbo-Frodo (21Roussel A.

Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar). The figures were generated with VMD (25Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol.

Silicon Graphics, Mountain View, CA1991: 81Google Scholar). The atomic coordinates and structure factors have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank at RCSB (accession codes 1PT7, 1PT5, and 1PT8 for the apo-enzyme and the binary and the ternary complexes, respectively).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONCompleteness and Quality of the Models—The crystal structure of the product of the yfdW gene was determined at 1.8, 2.0, and 2.2 Å resolution for the apo-enzyme and the binary and ternary complex, respectively. In each of the three cases, a dimer is contained in an asymmetric unit. The final apo-protein model consists of 830 residues (415 residues/monomer of the 416 in sequence), 8 phosphate ions, 2 glycerol molecules, and 591 water molecules. The model of the binary complex contains 830 residues, 2 AcCoA molecules, and 708 water molecules, and the ternary complex contains, in addition, 2 oxalate molecules and counts 453 water molecules.A total of 92.4, 92.9, and 91.2% of the residues are located in the most favorable region of the PROCHECK (24Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) Ramachandran plot of the apo-protein and the binary and ternary complex, respectively (Table I). The apo-protein has no residues in the disallowed region, whereas in the complex structures Leu363 is located in the disallowed region. Its good electron density map indicates that this high energy conformation is not artifactual, however. The unfavorable interactions of the Leu363 side chain are likely to be outweighed by a favorable hydrogen bond between the carbonyl group of Pro362 and the nitrogen atom of Arg364 involved in a γ-turn.Overall Structure of the Monomers—Each monomer can be divided into four distinct structural domains featuring an ellipsoidal ring structure (Fig. 2A). The large hole observed at the center of the molecular surface is filled by the second monomer (see next section) (Fig. 2, B and C). A first large Rossman fold domain is located at the N terminus (Fig. 2A , bottom, orange). Progressing anticlockwise (Fig. 2A), the small domain 2 (yellow) bridges domain 1 with domain 3 (blue) and is followed by the split C-terminal domains 4a and 4b (green). The N- and C-terminal regions are close together and form a globular superstructure closing the ring.Fig. 2Crystal structure of the YdfW gene product. A, view of the monomer secondary structure color-identified by domain: 1, orange; 2, yellow; 3, blue; and 4, green). The N and C termini are identified by red and blue circles, respectively, and the helices are numbered 1–18. B, view of the dimer in the binary complex. The first subunit molecular surface is colored according to surface curvature with convex surfaces in green and concave surfaces in white, and the second subunit, represented as a white tube, passes through the hole of the first monomer. The AcCoA molecule is partially visible along the monomers interface; its sulfur atom is hidden in a surface crevice. The second AcCoA molecule is partially visible through the hole of the first monomer. C, schematic representation of the dimer-interlaced rings. The domains have been approximately located.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Domain 1 (residues 1–139 and 166–200) is formed by 6 parallel β-strands (β1–β6) flanked by 6 helices on either sides (Fig. 2A). Domain 2 (residues 140–165 and 201–248) contains four helices and coil/turn regions. Domain 3 encompasses residues 250–339. Strands β7–β9 form an antiparallel β-sheet covered on its outwards face by helices α11 and α14. The C-terminal domain 4 can be split into two subdomains. Subdomain 4a contains a two-stranded antiparallel β-sheet (β10 and β11) and helices α15 and α16 (residues 339–383). Strand β11 interacts with helix α3 of the N-terminal region. Subdomain 4b comprises a coil-and-turn region with two C-terminal α-helices, α17 and α18 (residues 384–416), which close the ring and are tightly packed against domain 1. The arrangement of domain 1 against domain 4b results in a globular substructure.The interactions between the N- and C-terminal regions participating in the ring closure involve 16 hydrogen bonds and two salt bridges. Residues participating in the intramolecular interactions are located between Arg46 and Glu81 and between Arg364 and Ala415 at the N- and C-terminal ends, respectively. The salt bridges are established between Asp51 and Arg364 and between Arg68 and Glu399.Dimer Association—The YfdW dimer has overall dimensions of 64 × 56 × 48 Å (Fig. 2B). The dimeric nature of YfdW was observed in solution by gel filtration and dynamic light scattering (14Sulzenbacher G. Gruez A. Roig-Zamboni V. Spinelli S. Valencia C. Pagot F. Vincentelli R. Bignon C. Salomoni A. Grisel S. Maurin D. Huyghe C. et al.Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2002; 58: 2109-2115Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Superimposition of the native main chains A and B leads to an r.m.s.d. of 0.14 Å, indicating that both monomers have identical structures.The YfdW dimer is formed by two elongated rings that interpenetrate as the two first rings of a chain (Fig. 2). As a consequence of this topology, the dimer is tightly bound by an extensive interface of 3540 A2 of a total surface of 13,300 A2/monomer, accounting for 27% of the surface area of each of the monomers. Indeed, the biological relevance of the dimer is rather obvious considering its structure.The interactions between each monomer involve numerous van der Waals and hydrophobic contacts, which, at the dimer level, account for a well packed hydrophobic core. The dimer is further stabilized by 36 direct hydrogen bonds/monomer spanning residues 128 to 378. Although the majority of the contacts involve residues located in coil or loop regions, some of them are made by residues located in secondary structure elements. Helices α9 and α10, which protrude from domains 1, yield 13 hydrogen bonds and play a major role in the intermolecular contacts. They interact with strand β11 through a network of 7 hydrogen bonds involving residues Arg209A and Gln216A of a monomer and Leu368B, Thr369B, and Val370B of the other monomer. In addition Arg209A, a key residue of the dimer architecture, is involved in two additional hydrogen bonds with Gln24B and Met62B located in helix α1 and α3, respectively. Helices α6 and α7, which are close to helix α9, are also involved in intermolecular contacts with loop and coil regions of the C terminus of the other monomer. Furthering these interactions, residues Thr197A and Thr195A of strand β6 interact with Lys375B and Ser377B and provide, along with Phe376B, an extra β-strand to the α/β structure.Acetyl-CoA and Acetyl-CoA·Oxalate Complexes—Because formyl-CoA is an unstable molecule, the YfdW gene product was co-crystallized with CoA and with AcCoA, a surrogate ligand of formyl-CoA. Although crystallization with AcCoA yielded crystals containing the cofactor, CoA could never be identified. Electron density consistent with bound AcCoA molecules appears at two sites of the dimer, one in each subunit, separated by a distance of ∼25 Å.The apo and AcCoA complex structures can be superposed with an r.m.s.d. of 0.8 Å. This deviation is significantly above background because monomers A and B of the native and complex dimer structures display r.m.s.d. values of only 0.15 Å. The same low value (0.14 Å) is also observed when the AcCoA and the AcCoA/oxalate structures are superimposed, indicating that they are identical and that AcCoA is the trigger of protein conformational change, whereas oxalate has no global effect. The deviations between the apo and the binary or ternary structures are observed in several places: between residues 97 and 118, a surface helix, with amplitudes of 1–2 Å; between residues 247 and 251, the GGGGQP motif (Fig. 1), with amplitudes up to 3 Å; then in a long segment between residues 272 and 335 with small deviations of 0.5–1 Å; finally, at the C terminus, residues 397–416, with the largest deviations up to 3.5 Å. The conformational change of the 97–118 and 247–251 segments is clearly linked to AcCoA binding, as favorable contacts are established between these segments and AcCoA.AcCoA displays a Z-shaped conformation. It is located at the interface of both monomers (Fig. 2B) in a crevice of the open twist α/β structure with its adenine base and ribose sugar pointing toward the solvent, whereas the thioester group is buried deep inside the protein, 10 Å from the protein surface. AcCoA rides the β1 and β4 strands, with the walls of the cavity formed by loops between strands and helices β2–α2, β3–α4, and β5–α7, and between helices α5–α6 and α1–α7.AcCoA and CoA have been found to be flexible molecules as illustrated by the large number of different conformations observed in protein complexes (27Engel C. Wierenga R. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1996; 6: 790-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This property is reflected here, as the electron density map reveals the coexistence of two discrete conformations for the carbonyl group of the acetyl group of the molecules. The acetyl group of AcCoA is likely to interact with catalytically relevant residues. Its two conformers are located roughly on either side of Asp169, bringing the acetate moiety into contact with it (3.0–3.4 Å). In one of the conformers, the carbonyl of acetate binds Gln17 NH, whereas in the other, Glu140 NH is the hydrogen bond provider. In this latter case, the carbonyl occupies the site of a phosphate ion in the apo-structure. Active site side chains moved upon complexation, providing closer contacts with AcCoA. This is the case for tyrosines 139 and 59 (1- and 2-Å deviation at OH) and to a lesser extent for other residues.The binary and ternary complex structures are virtually identical; the main chains are superimposed, and the active site side chains as well as the AcCoA molecules occupy identical positions. The oxalate molecule is clearly defined in the electron density map of the ternary complex, although with high B-factors (79 versus 42 Å2 for the protein). It is located 8.2 and 10.0 Å away from each carbonyl group of the two conformations of AcCoA. This position is not favorable for catalysis and should be considered as a “resting” position along the reaction pathway. Oxalate occupies the position of Gly249B (from the other monomer) in the structure of the apo-enzyme. Gly249 belongs to a stretch of residues (246GGGGQP251), which moves considerably in the binary and ternary complex with respect to the apo-enzyme. This loop is kept in position by a hydrogen bond between Tyr59 OH and Gly248 carbonyl. The relocation of this loop is the major contribution of active site reshaping in the complex structures. The oxalate resting site is formed, therefore, on one side by the relocated Gly247–Pro251 loop of the other monomer, and on the other side by side chains of Leu49 and Gln48 with which it forms a hydrogen bond (Fig. 3A). One carboxyl group of the oxalate is directed toward the bulk solvent and the other toward a channel containing a water molecule and abutting AcCoA. This channel is large enough for the oxalate molecule to diffuse along it. An active position of oxalate can readily be modeled 6.0 Å away from the experimental resting position, in contact with the AcCoA carbonyl group. The remote carboxyl group of the active oxalate occupies a molecular “hot spot,” populated by a water molecule in the ternary complex and by a phosphate ion in the apo-enzyme. The active oxalate modeled is located in a cavity lining Tyr139 on one side and comprising Val16, Gln48, and Tyr59 on the other side. Its remote carbonyl can establish hydrogen bonds with Gln48, Tyr139, and Gln250B (Fig. 3A). Its proximal carboxyl group is poorly locked instead; its closest potential hydrogen bond provider is Tyr59. It is very close to the acetyl moiety of AcCoA, this latter being sandwiched between oxalate and Asp139 (Fig. 3A).Fig. 3The catalytic site and mechanism of YfdW.

The global reaction can be described by the equation CoA-CHO + COO-COO → CoA-CO-COO + HCO2. During catalysis, CoA-CHO should give the formyl moiety to an acceptor, liberating a CoA molecule. In a subsequent step, the CoA should perform a nucleophilic attack on an activated oxalate, yielding the CoA-oxalate. The complex structure suggests that Asp169 plays a pivotal role in catalysis as a nucleophile.In a first step, Asp169 may perform a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl of the formyl-CoA, which after the breakage of the thioester bond would release CoA, yielding an Asp-formyl adduct. The reaction intermediate forms an oxyanion, which should be stabilized by an appropriate molecular arrangement called oxyanion hole (28Kraut J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1977; 46: 331-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3B , top). Depending on the AcCoA conformer, the oxyanion hole might be formed by Gln140 NH or by Gln17 and Ser18 NH atoms. This latter oxyanion hole geometry with two NH groups seems to be preferred in nature (29van Tilbeurgh H. Egloff M.-P. Martinez C. Rugani N. Verger R. Cambillau C.

https://openalex.org/W1965213327,"The urea induced equilibrium denaturation behavior of glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase from Escherichia coli (GlnRS) in 0.25 m potassium l-glutamate, a naturally occurring osmolyte in E. coli, has been studied. Both the native to molten globule and molten globule to unfolded state transitions are shifted significantly toward higher urea concentrations in the presence of l-glutamate, suggesting that l-glutamate has the ability to counteract the denaturing effect of urea. d-Glutamate has a similar effect on the equilibrium denaturation of glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase, indicating that the effect of l-glutamate may not be due to substrate-like binding to the native state. The activation energy of unfolding is not significantly affected in the presence of 0.25 m potassium l-glutamate, indicating that the native state is not preferentially stabilized by the osmolyte. Dramatic increase of coefficient of urea concentration dependence (m) values of both the transitions in the presence of glutamate suggests destabilization and increased solvent exposure of the denatured states. Four other osmolytes, sorbitol, trimethylamine oxide, inositol, and triethylene glycol, show either a modest effect or no effect on native to molten globule transition of glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase. However, glycine betaine significantly shifts the transition to higher urea concentrations. The effect of these osmolytes on other proteins is mixed. For example, glycine betaine counteracts urea denaturation of tubulin but promotes denaturation of S228N λ-repressor and carbonic anhydrase. Osmolyte counteraction of urea denaturation depends on osmolyte-protein pair.

For example, glycine betaine counteracts urea denaturation of tubulin but promotes denaturation of S228N λ-repressor and carbonic anhydrase. Osmolyte counteraction of urea denaturation depends on osmolyte-protein pair. Folding of a polypeptide chain into a precise three-dimensional structure has been a subject of intense study over the past several decades (1Baldwin R.L. Rose G.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 77-83Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar, 2Dobson C.M. Karplus M. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 92-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). Despite much progress, a complete understanding still eludes us. Much attention is now devoted to protein folding in vivo, where the cellular environment profoundly influences folding (3Caplan A.J. Trends Cell Biol. 1999; 9: 262-268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 4Fink A.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 425-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). This has led to the discovery of the chaperones. Another aspect of in vivo environments that differ significantly from in vitro environments normally used for protein folding studies is the presence of osmolytes. Osmolytes are small molecules that accumulate inside the cell at relatively high concentrations and protect the intracellular proteins against environmental stress. Thus, they play a crucial role in protein stabilization. Although some efforts have been directed toward understanding the effects of osmolytes on protein stability, little is known about their effect on folding intermediates and partially unfolded states of proteins. Partially unfolded states are not only of crucial importance in understanding the folding processes but may play a crucial role in many diseases that involve extracellular protein aggregation and amyloid fibril formation, such as Alzheimer's disease and Scrapie (5Serpell L.C. Sunde M. Blake C.C. Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 1997; 53: 871-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 6Booth D.R. Sunde M. Bellotti V. Robinson C.V. Hutchinson W.L. Fraser P.E. Hawkins P.N. Dobson C.M. Radford S.E. Blake C.C. Pepys M.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar). Similar intracellular protein aggregates (Lewy bodies) are also known to play an important role in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease (7Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury P.T. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1318-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). Very little is known about the role of osmolytes on such processes, although it is generally recognized that cells in the brain accumulate high concentrations of several osmolytes (8Gullans S.R. Verbalis J.G. Annu. Rev. Med. 1993; 44: 289-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 9Nagelhus E.A. Amiry-Moghaddam M. Lehmann A. Ottersen O.P. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 359: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Many different types of osmolytes have been identified: amino acids, sugars, polyhydroxy compounds, and amine derivatives (10Yancey P.H. Clark M.E. Hand S.C. Bowlus R.D. Somero G.N. Science. 1982; 217: 1214-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (3013) Google Scholar). Despite the varied chemical nature of different osmolytes, it is generally thought that osmolytes do not bind to proteins. A common mechanism of stabilization is the osmophobic effect that is the preferential destabilization of the unfolded state due to unfavorable transfer free energy of the peptide backbone from water to osmolyte solution (11Bolen D.W. Baskakov I.V. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 310: 955-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). However, it has been pointed out that the effect of an osmolyte may vary from protein to protein, suggesting the presence of other types of interactions (12Leirmo S. Harrison C. Cayley D.S. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2095-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). A comparison of actions of different osmolytes on unfolding behavior of different proteins may yield valuable clues regarding the mechanism of action of different osmolytes. In this article we have chosen to study the ability of several osmolytes to counteract urea denaturation of several proteins. In particular, we have studied in detail the effect of l-glutamate, a naturally occurring osmolyte (12Leirmo S. Harrison C. Cayley D.S. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T.

We have also investigated the effect of different osmolytes on urea-induced equilibrium denaturation of GlnRS and other unrelated proteins and found that the osmolyte effect is dependent on the nature of the osmolyte and the denatured states of the protein. Bovine erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase, potassium l-glutamate, and potassium d-glutamate were purchased from Sigma. Ultrapure urea was purchased from Spectrochem. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Tubulin was purified according to Bhattacharya et al. (15Bhattacharya A. Bhattacharyya B. Roy S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 28655-28661Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein Purification—Glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase was purified according Bhattacharyya et al. (16Bhattacharyya T. Bhattacharyya A. Roy S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). S228N λ repressor was a gift from Prof. N. C. Mandal and was purified according to Jana et al. (17Jana N.K. Deb S. Bhattacharyya B. Mandal N.C. Roy S. Protein Eng. 2000; 13: 629-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Equilibrium Denaturation Experiments—All experiments were carried out in 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.5, at 25 °C unless specifically mentioned otherwise. The equilibrium denaturation experiments were performed after incubating the protein in the desired urea concentration for 18 h at room temperature. Fluorescence measurements were carried out in a Hitachi F3010 spectrofluorometer. The excitation and emission band passes were 3 nm each. For measurement of ANS fluorescence, 30 μm ANS was mixed with the denatured protein, and sample fluorescence was measured. A 30 μm concentration was chosen because binding isotherms indicated that beyond this concentration some degree of saturation may occur. The excitation wavelength was 420 nm, and the emission wavelength was 482 nm. Emission wavelength was fixed at 482 because this is around the emission maximum of ANS bound to molten globule states of several proteins. Far UV CD spectra were measured in a Jasco J-600 spectropolarimeter using a 1-mm path length cuvette. Five spectra were signal-averaged for improvement of the signal-to-noise ratio. GlnRS concentrations were 7.5 μm for CD experiments and 2 μm for fluorescence experiments. Kinetics of Unfolding—Kinetics of unfolding was measured at 25 °C at different urea concentrations. Glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase was diluted to a given urea concentration (either in the presence of 0.25 m potassium l-glutamate or 0.25 m potassium chloride) at a final protein concentration of 2 μm and immediately transferred to a Hitachi F3010 spectrofluorometer. Fluorescence intensity at 340 nm was measured as a function of time. The excitation wavelength was 295 nm. For measurement of CD kinetics, a similar protocol was followed. The final protein concentration was 7.5 μm. Urea concentrations of 5, 6, 6.5, 7, and 8 m were used for CD, and 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, and 7 m were used for fluorescence. Limited Proteolysis and Trypsin Assay—GlnRS was incubated at 37 °C in the presence of 25:1 w/w l-1-tosylamido-2-phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-trypsin in 50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing either no osmolytes or 0.25 m osmolyte. The reaction was quenched with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride at the designated times at a final concentration of 1 mm and electrophoresed on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel using standard protocols (16Bhattacharyya T. Bhattacharyya A. Roy S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 739-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). A trypsin assay was conducted using benzoyl arginyl ethyl ester as the substrate, which was monitored at 253 nm. Curve Fitting—The data fitting was done using Kyplot (Koichi Yoshioka, 1997–1999, version 2.0 beta 4). The equilibrium profiles were fitted as described in Das et al. (18Das B.K. Bhattacharyya T. Roy S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5242-5247Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). For two-state equilibrium, the following equation was used. S=S0+S∞×exp((-ΔG0+(m×[urea]))/RT)1+exp((-ΔG0+(m×[urea]))/RT)(Eq. 1) For F 340/F 350, a correction was introduced in the equation, S=S0+(1-(F350∞/F3500))×S∞×exp((-ΔG0+(m×[urea]))/RT)1+(1-(F350∞/F3500))×exp((-ΔG0+(m×[urea]))/RT)(Eq. 2) For the three-state equilibrium, the equation, x003C;INLINE-FIGx003E;x003C;LINKLOCATOR=“bc3737338eq3”x003E;x003C;/INLINE-FIGx003E;(Eq. 3) was used, where S 0, S I, and S ∞ are signal intensities for 100% reactant, 100% intermediate, and 100% product, respectively. F 350 ∞ /F3500 refers to the ratio of fluorescence intensity at 350 nm for 100% product and 100% reactant, respectively. ΔG 0 refers to the free energy at zero urea concentration (the corresponding equilibrium constant defined as [product]/[reactant]). In the second equation, ΔG 10 and ΔG 20 refer to the free energy at zero urea concentration with the corresponding equilibrium constants defined as [intermediate]/[reactant] and [product]/[reactant], respectively. R, T, and m carry their usual meaning. The kinetics of fluorescence or CD change was fitted to the equation, S(t)=k1(S0-S∞)(k1+k1)×[k1/k1+exp(-(k1+k1)t)]+S∞(Eq. 4) whereas the F 340/F 350 ratio change was fitted to the equation, x003C;INLINE-FIGx003E;x003C;LINKLOCATOR=“bc3737338eq5”x003E;x003C;/INLINE-FIGx003E;(Eq. 5) where S(t) is the spectral signal at time t, k 1 is the forward rate constant, k -1 is the backward rate constant, S 0 is the signal at time 0, and S ∞ is the signal if all the starting material was converted to the product. F 3500 and F 350 ∞ refer to fluorescence values at 100% reactant and 100% product concentrations. Influence of l-Glutamate on Equilibrium Unfolding of GlnRS—The most ubiquitous unfolding intermediates belong to the molten globule class and are produced under a variety of conditions (19Zhang J. Matthews C.R. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 14881-14890Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 20Ohgushi M. Wada A. FEBS Lett. 1983; 164: 21-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (681) Google Scholar, 21Kuwajima K. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 102-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). In a previous study we detected an intermediate of molten globule class by equilibrium urea denaturation (18Das B.K. Bhattacharyya T. Roy S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5242-5247Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows the plot of fluorescence intensity, far UV circular dichroism, and ANS fluorescence in the presence of 0.25 m potassium l-glutamate as a function of urea. It is clear from this curve that a two-state approximation cannot be made. Fluorescence intensity declines rapidly with a midpoint around 3.25 m urea. The far UV CD spectral intensity declines with approximately two phases. The major phase has the midpoint of transition around 5.5 m urea. It was shown previously that in the presence of 0.1 m KCl, the native to molten globule transition occurred with very significant loss of fluorescence intensity and relatively small far UV CD change (18Das B.K. Bhattacharyya T. Roy S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5242-5247Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Based on these criteria, we suggest that the first transition, characterized by a major loss of fluorescence intensity, represents the previously characterized native to molten globule transition. It is now well documented that anilinonaphthalenesulfonates bind to molten globule states with higher fluorescence yields and are often used to verify the presence of molten globule states (22Poklar N. Lah J. Salobir M. Macek P. Vesnaver G. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 14345-14352Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 23Ferrer M. Barany G. Woodward C. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). ANS fluorescence increase peaks around 3.5 m urea followed by a rapid decline, supporting the argument that this is the previously characterized native to molten globule transition. It is likely that the transition represented by an almost total loss of far UV CD represents the intermediate to unfolded state transition. Fig. 2 shows the near UV CD, the far UV CD, and the fluorescence emission spectra of GlnRS native state, molten globule state (when the first transition is nearly complete but the transition to unfolded state has not taken place), and native state, all in the presence of 0.25 m potassium l-glutamate. It is clear that almost all native-like near UV CD spectrum disappears in 3.5 m urea, where much of the far UV CD and, hence, the secondary structure is preserved. This strongly supports the idea that the intermediate is the previously characterized molten globule. Interestingly the magnitude of near UV CD intensity loss is significantly greater than the situation in the absence of glutamate. Thus, the native to molten globule transition is distinctly shifted to higher urea concentrations in the presence of 0.25 m potassium l-glutamate, signifying either relative stabilization of native state or destabilization of the molten globule state. Because part of the effect of l-glutamate can originate from electrostatic effects of l-glutamate, we have measured the different spectroscopic signals as a function of urea concentration in the presence of 0.25 m KCl. A plot of different signals versus urea concentration is shown in Fig. 3. The insets show the fluorescence emission and far UV CD spectra of the native, molten globule, and denatured state. It is quite clear that the loss of fluorescence intensity occurs at a much lower urea concentration when compared with the profile in the presence of potassium l-glutamate (incidentally, the midpoint is also at a lower urea concentration than in the presence of 0.1 m KCl). This transition is centered around 1 m urea. The ANS binding peaks at very low urea concentrations (around 0.5 m urea), remains stable, and then finally declines with the midpoint centered around 3.75 m urea. The decline of the far UV CD is centered approximately around 3.75 m urea. All transitions are fitted as described before, and the extracted free energies are reported in Table I. An interesting observation is that in the presence of l-glutamate, both the ΔG and m values increase very significantly. The implication of this observation is discussed later. To clarify the relationships of different states in 0.25 ml-glutamate and KCl, we have analyzed ANS binding in detail. Fig. 4 shows the isotherms of ANS binding to native, molten globule, and denatured states of GlnRS in the presence of 0.25 ml-glutamate and KCl along with emission spectra in the inset. The molten globule and denatured state binding isotherms are very similar in l-glutamate and KCl. In the presence of glutamate, the native state binds ANS weakly, whereas in the presence of KCl (0.25 m) a fairly high degree of ANS binding is observed. Because in 0.1 m KCl, ANS binding is low (18Das B.K. Bhattacharyya T. Roy S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5242-5247Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), the higher ANS binding at 0.25 m KCl is consistent with significant destabilization of the native state at higher KCl concentration.Table IExtracted free energies from equilibrium urea denaturationTable IExtracted free energies from equilibrium urea denaturationFig. 4ANS binding to native (○), molten globule (•), and denatured state (□).

The solution conditions are same as in Fig. 1, and the inset lines have same meaning as in the inset of Fig. 3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) l -Glutamate Effect Is Not Due to Substrate-like Native State Binding—The natural substrate of glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase is l-glutamine, which is structurally similar to l-glutamate. To see whether such a dramatic effect of potassium l-glutamate is at least partly due to the substrate-like properties of potassium l-glutamate or the preferential binding to the native state, we have measured the denaturation profile in potassium d-glutamate. Because d-glutamine is not a substrate of GlnRS, it is unlikely that potassium d-glutamate will have any substrate-like properties. Fig. 5 shows the urea denaturation profile as measured by fluorescence intensity loss in the presence of 0.25 m potassium d-glutamate. The inset shows the fluorescence emission spectra of the native, molten globule and denatured states. As in potassium l-glutamate, the transition measured by the loss of fluorescence intensity is centered around 3.25 m urea. The ANS fluorescence peak also occurs around 3.5 m urea. The declining edge of ANS fluorescence occur around 4 m urea, suggesting that the urea denaturation in potassium d-glutamate is very similar to that in potassium l-glutamate. Thus, the effect of potassium l-glutamate on the urea denaturation profile is unlikely to be due to any putative substrate-like properties of potassium l-glutamate. This is consistent with the fact that l-glutamate accumulates at very high concentrations presumably without any effect of GlnRS activity. We have also attempted to measure the binding of glutamate to GlnRS by NMR by observing the effect of GlnRS on T1. We chose d-glutamate because it has a very similar effect on equilibrium denaturation profile. The longitudinal relaxation rates of α-proton of 1.5 mmd-glutamate were determined in the absence and in the presence of 50 μm GlnRS. The observed T1 values are 1.43 ± 0.03 s and 1.55 ± 0.05 s in the absence and presence of GlnRS, respectively. In a previous study we determined the binding of galactose using similar techniques and found that under similar conditions binding of galactose to Gal repressor led to T1 lowering of almost 2-fold (24Chatterjee S. Ghosh K. Dhar A. Roy S. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 2002; 49: 554-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). This suggests no significant binding of d-glutamate in a substrate-like manner to the native state and that the counteraction effect of glutamate is not due to substrate-like binding to the native state. One of the possibilities mentioned above is that somehow glutamate selectively stabilizes the native state (although we have ruled out the possibility of substrate-like binding). If the native state is selectively stabilized, the activation energy of unfolding would increase due to increasing energy difference between the native state and the succeeding transition state. Kinetics of unfolding has been used to study the activation energy barriers between the unfolding intermediates. Activation energies at several different denaturant concentrations may be obtained and extrapolated to zero denaturant concentration to obtain the activation energy in the absence of the denaturant. Fig. 6 shows the kinetics of denaturation of GlnRS at several urea concentrations as measured by fluorescence intensity and far UV CD. The curves can be fitted well to a first order rate equation. Fig. 7, A and B, shows the extrapolation of activation energy thus obtained to zero urea concentrations in the presence of 0.25 m potassium l-glutamate and in the presence of 0.25 m KCl. In contrast to the dramatic effect of potassium l-glutamate on the stability of the equilibrium intermediates, none of the rate constants is significantly affected when potassium l-glutamate replaces KCl. In 0.25 m KCl, the activation energies extrapolated to 0 m urea are 22.68 ± 0.16 and 23.6 ± 0.55 kcal/mol when unfolding was measured by F 340 and far UV CD, respectively. In 0.25 m potassium l-glutamate, the corresponding activation energies extrapolated to 0 m urea, are 22.36 ± 0.16, and 23.78 ± 0.41 kcal/mol, respectively. Clearly, unlike that of the stability of the intermediates derived from the equilibrium measurements, very little effect of chloride to Glu substitution is seen. The kinetics of denaturation when monitored by loss of fluorescence intensity represents native to molten-globule transition. If preferential stabilization of the native state occurred in glutamate, it is likely that the activation energy would have decreased in l-glutamate. The lack of such an effect argues against this possibility.Fig. 7Extrapolation of activation energies obtained at different urea concentrations to zero urea concentrations. ○, 0.25 m KCl; •, 0.25 m potassium l-glutamate.

Fig. 8 shows the effect of glycine betaine, sorbitol, trimethylamine N-oxide, triethylene glycol, and inositol on the equilibrium denaturation profile of GlnRS. Previously we have shown that a decrease of fluorescence intensity at 340 nm occurs due to the transition from the native state to the molten globule state. Glycine betaine shows very strong counteraction ability, whereas TMAO shows only modest counteraction ability. None of the other osmolytes has a significant effect. This is somewhat surprising, because osmolytes such as trimethylamine oxide are known to have significant effects on folding equilibrium of proteins (25Gazit E. Sauer R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16813-16818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). We have attempted to verify this destabilizing effect of l-glutamate on the denatured states in the present system using limited proteolysis as a tool. It is well known that proteases cleave denatured proteins faster than native proteins. Higher order structures in native proteins prevent proteases from gaining access to the scissile bonds. If an osmolyte destabilizes the denatured states and, hence, drives the equilibrium toward a more folded state, it is expected that such an osmolyte would decrease the rate of proteolysis. Fig. 9 shows the rate of proteolysis of GlnRS by trypsin in the absence of any osmolyte and in the presence of 0.25 m potassium l-glutamate or inositol or tri-ethylene glycol. It is clear that 0.25 m potassium l-glutamate significantly inhibits proteolysis by trypsin, whereas no significant effect is observed on the rate of proteolysis in the presence of inositol or triethylene glycol. The rate of hydrolysis of benzoyl arginyl ethyl ester by trypsin is not significantly affected by 0.25 m potassium l-glutamate, suggesting that the glutamate effect originates from its effect on GlnRS structure (Fig. 9D). This supports the observation that glutamate has a strong counteraction ability of urea effect, at least in this system.Fig. 9Trypsinolysis of GlnRS in the presence of 0.25 m osmolyte.

Table II shows the effect of osmolytes on three different proteins, carbonic anhydrase, S228N λ-repressor, and tubulin. The S228N mutant was chosen because it is known that the protein is monomeric under these conditions so that complications arising out of monomer dimer equilibrium will be avoided. In a previous study we showed that the S228N repressor denatures in two phases (there is another transition, which does not lead to any change in fluorescence spectra) if monitored by fluorescence emission maximum shift (26Banik U. Saha R. Mandal N.C. Bhattacharyya B. Roy S. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 15-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We have assigned the first transition to denaturation of a part of the C-terminal domain and the transition in the higher concentrations of urea to global denaturation of the C-terminal domain. Table II shows the effect of different osmolytes on equilibrium urea denaturation profile of S228N repressor. Both the transitions are strongly counteracted by l-glutamate and relatively weakly by TMAO. Triethylene glycol has no significant effect, whereas glycine betaine shifts the transition to lower urea concentrations, thus promoting denaturation. Interestingly, l-glutamate has no significant effect on urea denaturation of carbonic anhydrase. However, glycine betaine strongly counteracts in the case of tubulin but shifts the transition to a lower urea concentration in carbonic anhydrase. We conclude that urea counteraction is osmolyte-protein pair-specific and l-glutamate counteraction of urea effect is not confined to glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase.Table IIEffect of different osmolytes on the urea denaturation of different proteins Potassium l-glutamate and its close analogs are widely used in nature as osmolytes. In fact it is used as osmolytes by organisms from all three kingdoms of life (13Roberts M.F. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: 796-812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It is known to be a compatible solute (27Lai M.C. Sowers K.R. Robertson D.E. Roberts M.F. Gunsalus R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5352-5358Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Chirife J. Favetto G. Ferro Fontan C. J. Appl. Bacteriol. 1984; 56: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). It enhances protein-nucleic acid interaction and stabilizes proteins from temperature inactivation (12Leirmo S. Harrison C. Cayley D.S. Burgess R.R. Record Jr., M.T. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 2095-2101Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 29Jensen W.A. Armstrong J.M. De Giorgio J. Hearn M.T. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 472-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Several osmolytes play another important role in some organisms; that is, they counteract the effect of urea on protein structure. Trimethylamine oxide and glycine betaine belongs to this class of osmolytes (30Lever M. Randall K. Galinski E.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1528: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 31Burg M.B. Peters E.M. Bohren K.M. Gabbay K.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6517-6522Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 32Lin T.Y. Timasheff S.N. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12695-12701Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). We have shown in this article that potassium l-glutamate exerts a powerful counteraction effect to the denaturing effect of urea in the glutaminyl-tRNA synthetase system. What is surprising is that this effect is more powerful than the effect of trimethylamine oxide in this system. Most interestingly, none of the counteracting osmolytes is universally effective. Their counteraction ability depends on the nature of the protein and the denatured state. The mechanism of this powerful counteraction effect of some osmolytes is not known at this point. However, we can make some tentative conclusions. Because, l-glutamate is studied in detail here, we will focus on glutamate effect primarily. The m values of urea denaturation of both the native to molten globule and native to unfolded state are enhanced greatly in the presence of glutamate when compared with that obtained in the presence of potassium chloride. It was concluded that the m value of a transition is related to the change in the accessible surface area (33Myers J.K. Pace C.N. Scholtz J.M. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 2138-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1682) Google Scholar). Assuming that there is no significant change in the structure of the native state in the presence of l-glutamate (as borne out by CD and fluorescence properties), a change in accessible surface area is equivalent to a change in the structure of the denatured state. Many recent studies point out that the denatured states are not devoid of structure, as was believed earlier (34Shortle D. Ackerman M.S. Science. 2001; 293: 487-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 35Shi Z. Olson C.A. Rose G.D. Baldwin R.L. Kallenbach N.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9190-9195Crossref PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Shortle (36Shortle D. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 46: 217-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and Shortle and Wrabl (37Wrabl J. Shortle D. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 876-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) conclude that the m value of a transition is related to the structure of the denatured state. The larger value of m implies a less structured denatured state. It is interesting to note that the near UV CD intensity of the molten globule state in the presence of glutamate is considerably less than in the absence of glutamate, perhaps indicating a more disordered structure. The TMAO counteraction of urea effect has been studied in most detail. It was concluded by several investigators that TMAO counteraction can be entirely accounted for by unfavorable free energy of transfer of peptide backbone from water to an osmolyte-water mixture (38Wang A. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9101-9108Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Side chains contribute little. Recent work by Murphy and coworkers (39Zou Q. Bennion B.J. Daggett V. Murphy K.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2002; 124: 1192-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar) suggest that some of this unfavorable transfer free energy may originate from the ordering of the water structure by TMAO. In such a situation more solvent-exposed conformations will be destabilized. In the present situation, the denatured state becomes less structured in the presence of l-glutamate, and thus, it is unlikely that the glutamate counteraction is entirely due to the putative osmophobic effect, as the less structured states are likely to be more destabilized in the presence of an operative osmophobic force. A large change in ΔG between the native and the denatured states does indeed suggest destabilization of the denatured states. Because the less structured states are more prevalent in the presence of glutamate, it appears that they are destabilized the least; this is exactly the opposite of what would be expected if purely osmophobic forces are operative. How could increased destabilization occur for denatured states that are more compact? One of the possibilities may be that the side-chain exposures of these different states are different, and increased exposure of the side chains in the more exposed states leads to a partial compensation because transfer of free energy of many of the side chains from water to osmolyte solution is favorable. Another possible origin may be from the differential interaction of glutamate with denatured states having different solvent exposure. In this situation, either the osmolyte binds to the more exposed states preferentially or it is excluded more from the less exposed state. A third possibility is that the osmophobic contribution to destabilization is not just the sum of contributions of individual side chains and peptide bonds, but the contribution changes in the context of the structure. The molecular origin of such putative effects is completely unknown at this point. It is interesting that not all osmolytes have destabilizing effects on denatured states of GlnRS. TMAO has a modest urea counteraction effect and virtually no effect on m value, suggesting little effect on the nature of the denatured state. Polyols do not show any significant effect in this study. A number of other studies have previously noted this differential effect of osmolytes (13Roberts M.F. Front. Biosci. 2000; 5: 796-812Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In many situations, limited proteolysis is thought to take place from denatured states that are at equilibrium with the native state. If the denatured states are destabilized, it is expected that proteolysis under limiting conditions will decrease. It has been noted previously that although TMAO decreased the limited proteolysis rate of lactate dehydrogenase by trypsin, no significant effect is seen with glycine as an osmolyte (40Yancey P.H. Siebenaller J.F. J. Exp. Biol. 1999; 202: 3597-3603PubMed Google Scholar). Clearly, the nature of the protein and the osmolyte pair determines the outcome. Although osmophobic force is likely to be of general importance, specific effects of different osmolytes may be superimposed to yield the differential effect of different osmolytes. What may be the effect of such strong destabilization of the partially denatured state by l-glutamate? In the presence of osmolytes such as l-glutamate, which has significant effect on stability of intermediate molten globule state, the equilibrium concentration of partially unfolded states would decrease. In this sense the osmolytes of this type may have a synergistic effect with the chaperone systems, which also lowers the free concentration of the partially folded intermediates. This may lead to inhibition of protein aggregation and enhancement of folding yields in vivo. Another biological milieu where concentrations of partially denatured states may exert crucial role is in amyloid fibril formation. It has been hypothesized that fibril formation proceeds through an increased accumulation of partially denatured states of a protein (6Booth D.R. Sunde M. Bellotti V. Robinson C.V. Hutchinson W.L. Fraser P.E. Hawkins P.N. Dobson C.M. Radford S.E. Blake C.C. Pepys M.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (979) Google Scholar, 41Bychkova V.E. Ptitsyn O.B. FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 6-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). If osmolytes like l-glutamate indeed have a destabilizing role in the accumulation of such intermediates, they may play an inhibitory role in fibril formation. A complete exploration of the roles of osmolytes in protein aggregation and fibril formation may be of significant importance. We report that l-glutamate is a powerful counteracting agent toward denaturing effects of urea. Other osmolytes also show counteracting ability, but in all cases the effect appears to depend on the nature of the protein involved, indicating other effects beyond the osmophobic force."

Removing Mcm10 from the chromatin in G1 phase destabilizes the chromatin binding of Mcm2, suggesting that Mcm10 plays a role in the origin binding of the MCM2-7 complex (13Homesley L. Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Sawyer S. Christensen T. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 913-926PubMed Google Scholar). Mcm10 is not a member of the Mcm2-7 family. However, physical interactions between Mcm10 and several members of the Mcm2-7 family, including Mcm2, -3, -4, -6, and -7 have been observed (12Merchant A.M. Kawasaki Y. Chen Y. Lei M. Tye B.K. Mol.

Genetic analyses indicate that replication defects in the mcm10-1 and mcm7-1 mutants are mutually suppressed in the mcm10-1mcm7-1 double mutant (13Homesley L. Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Sawyer S. Christensen T. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 913-926PubMed Google Scholar). The mutual suppression of replication defects correlates with restoration of interactions between the two mutant proteins, suggesting that compensatory mutations in two directly interacting proteins lead to the mutual suppression (13Homesley L. Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Sawyer S. Christensen T. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 913-926PubMed Google Scholar). In vitro DNA replication analyses using Xenopus egg extracts demonstrate that Mcm10 plays a critical role in recruiting DNA polymerases to the pre-RC and that this function is dependent on its interaction with Mcm2-7 (18Wohlschlegel J.A.

Substantial sequence similarities among Mcm10 homologs are restricted to a conserved domain of about 210 amino acid residues (13Homesley L. Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Sawyer S. Christensen T. Tye B.K.

Indeed, currently known replication-defective Mcm10 mutant alleles all contain amino acid substitutions within this domain (13Homesley L. Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Sawyer S. Christensen T. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 913-926PubMed Google Scholar). Characterization of this conserved domain would be an important step toward understanding how Mcm10 functions.A sequence motif (309CX 10CX 11CX 2H335) (13Homesley L. Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Sawyer S.

Worthington M.T. Berg J.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Several classes of zinc fingers such as the CCHH, CCCC, CCHC, and CHCC families, categorized based on arrangements of the conserved cysteines and/or histidines in the motifs, have been characterized and shown to modulate their host proteins' interactions with DNA, RNA, or other proteins (32Berg J.M.

Chem. 1990; 19: 405-421Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). CCCH-type zinc fingers were recently identified in a number of RNA-binding proteins (31Amann B.T. Worthington M.T. Berg J.M. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 34Worthington M.T. Amann B.T. Nathans D. Berg J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 217-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). The CCCH motif in Mcm10 appears to be critical for Mcm10 function in DNA replication, since an amino acid substitution at the second conserved cysteine (C320Y) renders the mutant allele (mcm10–43) defective in the initiation of DNA replication and causes a temperature-sensitive growth defect (13Homesley L. Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Sawyer S. Christensen T. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 913-926PubMed Google Scholar). Zn2+ binding may be a general mechanism of DNA replication regulation, since many other replication initiation factors are also likely Zn2+-binding proteins. For example, four of the six MCM2-7 proteins contain a conserved putative zinc finger (28Tye B. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 649-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 36Kearsey S.E. Labib K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1398: 113-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Mutagenesis analyses of the putative zinc finger in Mcm2 indicate that the integrity of this motif is essential for Mcm2 function (37Yan H. Gibson S. Tye B.K. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 944-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The specific roles of these putative zinc fingers in replication initiation factors, however, have not been determined.In this study, we report that Mcm10 self-interacts and assembles into large homocomplexes. The conserved domain is sufficient to mediate the self-interaction. We show that the CX 10CX 11CX 2H motif in Mcm10 is a novel zinc-binding motif required for the self-interaction and Mcm10 homocomplex assembly. Mcm10 homocomplexes may provide the structural basis for its interaction with multiple subunits of the MCM2-7 hexameric ring.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESYeast Strains and Yeast Genetics Techniques—The Mcm10 knockout strain BTY107 (Matα, ade2-1, can1, ura3, leu2, trp1, ΔMCM10, pRS316MCM10) was a gift from N.

Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar) were followed for growth and transformation of yeast cells. Media containing 5′-fluoroorotic acid were used for selection against cells containing URA3-bearing plasmids as described (38Guthrie C. Fink G.R. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (2530) Google Scholar). Two-hybrid analysis was performed as described (24Lei M. Kawasaki Y. Tye B.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 5081-5090Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The interactions were measured as β-galactosidase activities produced in the yeast two-hybrid host strain EGY40 (39Golemis E.A. Brent R. Mol. Cell Biol. 1992; 12: 3006-3014Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The expression levels of the LexA fusion proteins in the yeast two-hybrid strains were determined by Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates with anti-LexA and anti-actin antibodies (40Lei M.

When PCR amplification was used in construction of expression plasmids, high fidelity DNA polymerase (DeepVent DNA polymerase; New England Biolabs) was used, and the amplified DNA fragments were verified by DNA sequencing. Fusion proteins encoded by pGEX4T-based plasmids include the glutathione S-transferase tag at the N terminus. Fusion proteins encoded by pET23-based plasmids include 6 histidines at the C terminus. The conserved domains (CD) expressed by the pQE30T plasmid include amino acid residues 147–356 of Mcm10 or Mcm10 mutants and an MRGSHHHHHHGSENLYFQGS tag at the N terminus.Table IPlasmids used in this studyPlasmidsDescriptionsSourcespGEX4TExpression vector for GST fusion proteinsAmersham BiosciencespGEX.Mcm10MCM10 ORF cloned in pGEX4TThis studypET23Expression vector for His6 fusion proteinsNovagenpET23.Mcm10Mcm10 ORF cloned in pET23This studypET23.Mcm10-43Mcm10-43 ORF cloned in pET23This studypET23.Mcm10-44Mcm10-44 ORF cloned in pET23This studypET23.Mcm10-45Mcm10-45 ORF cloned in pET23This studypQE30TExpression vector for His6 fusion proteinQiagenpQE30T.Mcm10CDCentral domain of Mcm10 cloned in pQE30TThis studypQE30T.Mcm10-43CDCentral domain of Mcm10-43 cloned in pQE30TThis studypQE30T.Mcm10-44CDCentral domain of Mcm10-44 cloned in pQE30TThis studypQE30T.Mcm10-45CDCentral domain of Mcm10-45 cloned in pQE30TThis studypRS315Yeast expression vector, LEU2 ARSH4B CEN6Ref. 44Sikorski R.S.

After isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside was added to the culture to 0.1 mm to induce expression, the culture was shifted to 21 °C with vigorous shaking for 4 h. Cells were harvested, resuspended in ice-cold buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaHPO4, pH 7.0, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Triton), and lysed by French press with four repetitions at 1000 p.s.i. To remove DNA from the lysate, DNase I (Sigma) was added at a concentration of 5 Kurtz units/ml and incubated on ice for 30 min. The lysate was subjected to centrifugation at 16,000 rpm in a bench top centrifuge for 15 min at 4 °C to remove cell debris. Lack of PCR amplification of the Mcm10 open reading frame from the lysate was used as an indicator of DNA-free lysate. The lysate was used for in vitro interaction assays (Fig. 1b). Mcm10-His6, Mcm10–43-His6, Mcm10–44-His6 and Mcm10–45-His6 were expressed with the same procedure using BL21(DE3)pLysS cells transformed with pET23.Mcm10, pET23.Mcm10–43, pET23.Mcm10–44, and pET23.Mcm10–45, respectively. Lysates prepared as described above were used for in vitro interaction assays (Fig. 1b) or for purification of the recombination proteins (see Fig. 5a). For purification of Mcm10-His6 and Mcm10–45-His6, the lysates were incubated with buffer A-equilibrated Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads (Qiagen, CA) at 4 °C for 1 h (0.5 ml of beads for 10 ml of lysates). The beads were packed into a 5-ml disposable column (Qiagen, CA), washed first with at least 10 bed volumes of buffer A and then with 5 bed volumes of 40 mm imidazole in buffer A. Mcm10-His6 or Mcm10–45-His6 retained on the beads were eluted twice with 0.5 ml of 250 mm imidazole in buffer A. To express Mcm10CD-His6, Mcm10–43CD-His6, Mcm10–44CD-His6, and Mcm10–45CD-His6 fusion proteins, pQE30T.Mcm10CD, pQE30T.Mcm10–43CD, pQE30T.Mcm10–44CD, or pQE30T.Mcm10–45CD was introduced into the bacterial strain, M15 (Qiagen). Cell lysates were prepared as described above after expressions of the recombinant proteins were induced. Mcm10-CD-His6 was purified (see Fig. 6b) as described above.Fig. 5Mcm10 assembles into homocomplexes. a, Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of purified recombinant Mcm10-His6 (lane 1) and Mcm10–45-His6 (lane 2) used for gel filtration analyses. b, Western blot analyses of fractions of gel filtration chromatography (S400) of Mcm10-His6 in 150 mm NaCl (first panel), 500 mm NaCl (second panel), 1 mm EDTA (third panel), Mcm10–45-His6 in 150 mm NaCl (fourth panel), and yeast cell lysate in 150 mm NaCl (fifth panel).

To load GST or GST-Mcm10 onto glutathione-agarose beads, lysates (500 μl) made from Escherichia coli cells expressing GST or GST-Mcm10 were incubated with buffer A-equilibrated beads (20 μl) at 4 °C for 2 h; After pelleting at 1000 rpm in a bench top centrifuge for 10 s at 4 °C, the beads with immobilized GST or GST-Mcm10 fusion protein were washed with buffer B (500 mm NaCl, 20 mm NaHPO4, pH 7.0, 5% glycerol, 0.1% Triton), which removes GST-Mcm10 retained on the beads through Mcm10 self-interaction. The beads were recovered and incubated with 100 μl of lysate prepared from cells expressing Mcm10-His6 fusion protein for 2 h. To remove nonspecific binding proteins, the beads were washed five times with 100 μl of buffer A for 5 min at 4 °C. The last two washes were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot to ensure that Mcm10-His6 bound nonspecifically was below the levels of detection after the washes. Subsequently, Mcm10-His6 retained through specific interactions with immobilized GST-Mcm10 was eluted twice with 100 μl of buffer B by incubating the suspension at 4 °C for 5 min. Finally, the beads were washed with 100 μl of 10 mm glutathione in buffer A to release GST or GST-Mcm10 from the beads. The eluants were examined by Western blot analysis using anti-Mcm10 antibodies (12Merchant A.M. Kawasaki Y. Chen Y. Lei M. Tye B.K. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 3261-3271Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) or anti-GST (Pierce) antibodies following standard protocols (41Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar).To compare the relative interaction efficiency of Mcm10 mutant alleles with GST-Mcm10 (see Fig. 3a), the relative concentrations of Mcm10 and Mcm10 mutant alleles in cell lysates were first estimated by Western blot analysis using anti-Mcm10 antibodies; then lysates (100 μl) with equal concentrations of Mcm10-His6, Mcm10–43-His6, Mcm10–44-His6, and Mcm10–45-His6 were incubated with four aliquots (20 μl each) of GST-Mcm10-coupled glutathione-agarose beads. The beads were then washed and eluted as described above, and the eluants were examined by Western blot analysis using anti-Mcm10 antibodies. To examine the effect of EDTA on the Mcm10 self-interaction (see Fig. 4c), the interaction assay was performed following the same procedure except that 1 mm or 10 mm EDTA in buffer A, instead of buffer B, was used to elute Mcm10-His6 retained on the bead through interaction with GST-Mcm10. To examine the interaction capacity of the Mcm10CD (conserved domain) (see Fig. 6a), the relative concentrations of Mcm10CD-His6 and mutant alleles in cell lysates were first quantitated by Western blot analysis using anti-His6 antibodies; then lysates with equal concentrations of Mcm10CD or Mcm10CD mutants (100 μl) were incubated with four aliquots (20 μl each) of GST-Mcm10-coupled glutathione-agarose beads. The beads were then washed and eluted as described above, and the eluants were examined by Western blot analysis using anti-His6 antibodies (Pierce).Fig. 3Growth phenotype of mcm10 mutants shows that the C309X10C320X11C332X2H335 motif is essential for Mcm10 function.

Upon the addition of Zn2+, a dramatic increase in chemical shift dispersion for signals corresponding to backbone amides (gray horizontal bars) is shown in the ZFMcm10 peptide spectra (upper two traces). Backbone amide resonances were identified by correlations with aliphatic side chain resonance in the two-dimensional TOCSY spectrum, which distinguishes them from other side chain NH2 or aromatic signals that also occur in the 6–10-ppm chemical shift range.

UGT1A8 and 1A10 are expressed exclusively in the gastrointestinal tract, whereas UGT1A9 is expressed mainly in the liver and kidneys. To determine the factors contributing to the extrahepatic expression of these UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, we have cloned and characterized the promoters of the UGT1A8, 1A9, and 1A10 genes and studied their regulation in the colon cell line, Caco2. Their transcription start sites were mapped, and a functional overlapping Sp1/initiator-like site was identified which strongly contributed to UGT1A8 and 1A10 promoter activity. The high promoter activity of UGT1A8 and 1A10 correlated with the binding of nuclear proteins (complex B) to this region. Two-bp differences in the corresponding site in the UGT1A9 promoter prevented the binding of complex B and reduced promoter activity. Although Sp1 was able to bind to the Sp1/initiator-like site, its binding was dispensable for promoter activity. However, the binding of Sp1 to a second Sp1 site 30 bp 5′ to the Sp1/initiator-like site greatly enhanced the activity of the UGT1A8 and 1A10 promoters. These results provide evidence that the UGT1A8, 1A9, and 1A10 genes are differentially regulated through an initiator element in their 5′-flanking regions.

Glucuronidation represents one of the major pathways through which the body is able to deactivate and excrete a wide range of lipophilic compounds including drugs, environmental pollutants, dietary chemicals, and endogenous compounds such as bilirubin, steroids, and bile acids (1Dutton G.J. Glucuronidation of Drugs and Other Compounds. CRC Press Inc., Boca Raton, FL1980Google Scholar). Accommodation of such a structurally diverse range of chemicals is provided by the superfamily of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1The abbreviations used are: UGT, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase; EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; GABP, GA-binding protein; RACE, RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends; TF, transcription factor; USF, upstream stimulatory factor; wt, wild-type; YY1, ying-yang 1. enzymes, of which there are 16 known functional enzymes in humans to date. UGTs are classified into two families, UGT1 and UGT2, based on their amino acid sequence similarity (2Mackenzie P.I. Owens I.S. Burchell B. Bock K.W. Bairoch A. Belanger A. Fournel-Gigleux S. Green M. Hum D.W. Iyanagi T. Lancet D. Louisot P. Magdalou J. Chowdhury J.R. Ritter J.K. Schachter H. Tephly T.R. Tipton K.F. Nebert D.W. Pharmacogenetics. 1997; 7: 255-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). The UGT2 family is subdivided further into UGT2A and UGT2B subfamilies, each encompassing genes encoded by six unique exons located on chromosome 4 (3Monaghan G. Clarke D.J. Povey S. See C.G. Boxer M. Burchell B. Genomics. 1994; 23: 496-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 4Turgeon D. Carrier J.S. Levesque E. Beatty B.G. Belanger A. Hum D.W. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 295: 489-504Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In contrast, the UGT1A subfamily is encoded by a single gene locus on chromosome 2, recently shown to span >200 kb (5Gong Q.H. Cho J.W. Huang T. Potter C. Gholami N. Basu N.K. Kubota S. Carvalho S. Pennington M.W. Owens I.S. Popescu N.C. Pharmacogenetics. 2001; 11: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Eight functional UGT1A enzymes have been shown to be expressed in humans (UG1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A6, 1A7, 1A8, 1A9, and 1A10), and four pseudogenes (1A2, 1A11, 1A12, and 1A13) have been identified (6Tukey R.H. Strassburg C.P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 581-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (1304) Google Scholar). Each UGT1A form contains a unique exon 1, which is joined to a shared set of exons 2–5 through RNA splicing. Characterization of the UGT1A locus has shown that the first exon of each individual form is organized in series upstream from exon 2 (5Gong Q.H. Cho J.W. Huang T. Potter C. Gholami N. Basu N.K.

Yeatman M.T. Owens I.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 3257-3261Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The first exons are separated from each other by 5′-flanking regions of 5–23 kb in length. Much accumulated evidence suggests that the 5′-flanking region of each UGT1A exon 1 contains promoter elements capable of regulating their expression. Analysis of the promoters of the human UGT1A1 and 1A6 genes showed that they were functional in liver and colon cells, respectively (8Bernard P. Goudonnet H. Artur Y. Desvergne B. Wahli W. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 526-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Studies on the rat UGT1A6 and UGT1A7 genes have also shown that their promoter regions are capable of stimulating transcription in liver cells (9Emi Y. Ikushiro S. Iyanagi T. J. Biol.

In addition, UGT1A genes have recently been demonstrated to be induced by the nuclear receptors constitutive active receptor (CAR), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), pregnane X receptor (PXR) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) through binding to their promoter regions (9Emi Y.

Unlike the UGT1A1–6 genes, which have interindividual variation in expression in the gastrointestinal tract, UGT1A7–10 appear to be expressed consistently in these tissues (24Strassburg C.P. Nguyen N. Manns M.P. Tukey R.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 54: 647-654PubMed Google Scholar, 25Strassburg C.P. Kneip S. Topp J. Obermayer-Straub P. Barut A. Tukey R.H. Manns M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36164-36171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). This unique pattern of expression of the UGT1A7–10 gene cluster suggests that coordinated, tissue-specific mechanisms of regulation may be important for their expression. Both the human UGT1A1 and UGT1A6 genes utilize TATA boxes to initiate transcription (12Munzel P.A. Lehmkoster T. Bruck M. Ritter J.K. Bock K.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 72-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 26Brierley C.H. Senafi S.B. Clarke D. Hsu M.H. Johnson E.F. Burchell B. Adv. Enzyme Regul. 1996; 36: 85-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). However, initiation of gene transcription by RNA polymerase II may also occur through initiator regions in the promoters of genes. TATA box-dependent mechanisms of transcription are well characterized, the first step involving the binding of transcription factor IID (TFIID) to A/T-rich sequences generally located 25–30 bp upstream from the transcription start site, and subsequent formation of a preinitiation complex containing RNA polymerase II (27Orphanides G. Lagrange T. Reinberg D. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2657-2683Crossref PubMed Scopus (852) Google Scholar). In contrast, the mechanism of transcription initiation through initiator regions is less clearly understood. Initiator regions are found in both TATA-containing and TATA-less promoters and generally encompass the transcription start site (28Smale S.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1351: 73-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar). The initiator site is sufficient for direct transcription alone, but transcription is often enhanced through upstream TATA box or Sp1 binding sites (29Carcamo J. Buckbinder L. Reinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8052-8056Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar, 30Smale S.T. Baltimore D.

Although the sequence requirements of initiator sites vary, they adhere loosely to a Py Py A+1 N T/A Py Py consensus, where Py represents a pyrimidine (32Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). The relative strength of the initiator site appears to be enhanced by the presence of further pyrimidine residues surrounding the core consensus site (32Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 33Lo K. Smale S.T. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 182: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar).

However, it is not clear which factors influence the binding of different proteins to initiator sites. To examine the mechanisms contributing to the differential regulation of the UGT1A8–10 genes in extrahepatic tissues, we have cloned and characterized the promoters of each gene and studied their regulation in the colon cell line Caco2. The transcription start sites of UGT1A8, 1A9, and 1A10 were mapped, and a nearby overlapping Sp1/initiator-like site was identified which strongly contributed to UGT1A8 and 1A10 promoter activity. Initiation of transcription through TATA box-dependent mechanisms was not observed for these UGT genes. Isolation of the UGT1A8, 1A9, and 1A10 Genes and 5′-Flanking Regions—The UGT1A8, 1A9, and 1A10 promoter regions were isolated from a human placenta lambda genomic library (Clontech) after several rounds of screening for their adjacent exons. Briefly, a 480-bp EcoRI/NcoI fragment was prepared from exon 1 of the UGT1A8 (corresponding to bases 96–576) and labeled with [32P]dATP by random priming using the DECAprime II DNA labeling kit (Ambion). Hybond-N membranes (Amersham Biosciences) from plaque lifts were denatured, neutralized, and UV cross-linked as in the manufacturer's protocol (PT1010-1). Prehybridization was carried out in a solution of 5 × SSC, 5 × Denhardt's and 0.5% SDS for 4 h at 42 °C before hybridization with 1 × 106 cpm/μl probe overnight. Membranes were then washed serially twice in 2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 5 min at room temperature and twice in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS for 30 min at 65 °C followed by exposure to autoradiographic film with intensification at -70 °C overnight. Positive plaques were picked and screened by restriction digestion and sequencing for appropriate inserts from the UGT1A locus. Transcription Start Site Mapping—Transcription start sites were mapped using the First Choice RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) kit designed to amplify cDNA only from full-length capped RNA (Ambion). Total RNA was isolated from Caco2 cells using the Qiagen RNeasy midi kit (Qiagen). Five μg of total RNA was treated with calf intestinal phosphatase, phenol-chloroform extracted, and decapped using tobacco acid pyrophosphatase, according to the manufacturer's protocol. Resulting full-length RNA was ligated with the 5′-RACE adapter provided and reverse transcribed according to the manufacturer's instructions. A pool of UGT1A8, 1A9, and 1A10 cDNAs was initially amplified by PCR using a common reverse primer within exon 1 (5′-227GTCTTCACTGTGCAATTCAGTG206-3′) and the 5′-RACE outer primer provided. The conditions used were as follows: 94 °C for 4 min followed by 35 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min, and then 72 °C for 10 min. A tobacco acid pyrophosphatase negative control was also amplified to confirm the specificity of the RACE product. To isolate the UGT1A8, 1A9, and 1A10 cDNAs, nested PCRs were carried out with 1/10 of the original PCR using the 5′-RACE inner primer provided and 1A8 (5′-94GCACTACCAGCAGCTTCCCTGCCTCAGC67-3′)-, 1A9 (5′-124TTTCTCCACCACCGACCT141-3′)-, and 1A10 (5′-49TAGACACACACATAAAGGAAC29-3′)-specific exon 1 reverse primers under the following conditions: UGT1A8 (as above but for 30 cycles), 1A9, and 1A10 (as above but with annealing temperature of 50 °C and for 30 cycles). Resulting PCR products were purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) and cloned into the pCR-Blunt vector (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Several clones were selected and sequenced to confirm the position of each transcription start site. Construction of Luciferase Reporter Constructs—The proximal ∼1 kb of the UGT1A8 and 1A10 promoters were amplified from the lambda clones isolated above by PCR and cloned directionally into the KpnI and MluI sites of the pGL3-basic reporter vector (Promega). The primers used for the construction were the 1A8-1034for and 1A10-1036for specific forward primers with the 1A8/10rev common reverse primer (Table I). The proximal 1 kb of the UGT1A9 promoter was amplified using the 1A9-1000for and 1A9rev primers (Table I) and cloned non-directionally into a PstI site generated in the multiple cloning region of the pGL3-basic vector (pGL3+). pGL3+ was generated by ligating the fragment generated by annealing two overlapping oligonucleotides (5′-CGCGTCTGCAGGAATTCGCTAGCCCGGGC-3′ and 5′-TCGAGCCCGGGCTAGCGAATTCCTGCAGA-3′) into pGL3-basic digested with MluI and XhoI. The resulting construct has PstI and EcoRI sites inserted between the existing MluI and NheI sites. Mutations in the UGT1A8, 1A9, and 1A10 Sp1/initiator-like region were generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) with the forward (for) and reverse (rev) primers pairs shown in Table I (primers are named by gene and then the base mutated, see Fig. 1; the only exception being the 1A8-1036/+45 3′Sp1 mutant which was made with the 1A8mut3′Sp1for and 1A8mut3′Sp1rev primers). The proximal 55 bp of the UGT1A8 promoter was amplified by PCR using the 1A8-55for and 1A8/10rev primers. The upstream Sp1 site was mutated by PCR using the 1A8-55mut5′Sp1for and 1A8/10rev primers (Table I). The resulting PCR products were cloned into the KpnI and MluI sites of the pGL3-basic vector.Table IPrimers used to create luciferase promoter constructs and mutants The proximal ∼1-kb UGT1A8, 1A9, and 1A10 promoters were amplified by PCR using the 1A8-1034for, 1A9-1000for, and 1A10-1036for forward primers, with the 1A8/10rev and 1A9rev reverse primers, respectively. Resulting PCR products were subsequently cloned into the pGL3-basic vector (see “Experimental Procedures“). The wild-type and upstream Sp1 mutant 1A8-55/+45 regions were amplified using the 1A8-55for and 1A8-55mut5′ Sp1for forward primers with the 1A8/10rev reverse primer and subsequently cloned into the pGL3 vector (see “Experimental Procedures™). Mutations in the UGT1A8, 1A9, and 1A10 Sp1/initiator-like regions were generated using the remaining forward and reverse primer pairs according to the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Mutations are represented by a bold base, and the restriction sites used for cloning are underlined.Fig. 1Alignment of the UGT1A8, 1A9, and 1A10 proximal promoters and location of putative transcription factor binding sites. Approximately 150 bp of the proximal UGT1A8, 1A9, and 1A10 promoters were aligned from the methionine (ATG) initiation codon (shown in bold italics). Identical bases in the UGT1A9 and 1A10 genes compared with the UGT1A8 gene are indicated with a period, nonidentical bases with the base change, and missing bases with a dash. The transcription start sites of each gene are marked with a bold base. The putative Sp1 sites, initiator binding site, and the T-region are boxed. Several base differences near the overlapping Sp1/initiator-like site have been highlighted (numbered 1–4).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cell Culture and Transfection—Caco2 cells obtained from the American Type Culture Collection were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mm mixture of nonessential amino acids (all from Invitrogen), and 80 μg/ml gentamycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Cells were plated into 24-well plates at a density of 7.5 × 104 cells/well and transfected the following day with 0.5 μg of promoter construct and 0.025 μg of the Renilla vector pRL-null (Promega) using 2 μl/well LipofectAMINE 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). After 48 h, the cells were harvested in 100 μl of 1 × passive lysis buffer, and 20 μl was assayed for luciferase and Renilla activity using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega). Luminescence was measured using a Packard TopCount luminescence and scintillation counter (Mt. Waverly, Victoria, Australia). Nuclear Extracts and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)— Nuclear extracts were prepared from Caco2 cells essentially as described by Schreiber et al. (49Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). The sense strand of the UGT1A8, 1A9, and 1A10 oligonucleotides used for EMSA are shown in Figs. 2B, 5B, and 7C. Probes were made by annealing complementary sense and antisense oligonucleotides followed by end labeling with [32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and purification through G25 columns (Amersham Biosciences). Reactions were carried out with 5 μg of Caco2 nuclear extract, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC), and unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides (if needed) in a 15-μl reaction containing 25 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 100 mm KCl, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, and 10% glycerol for 10 min on ice. 50,000 cpm of probe (0.5–1 ng) was added to the reaction mixture, which was incubated for a further 30 min at room temperature. For supershift assays, antibodies (Santa Cruz) were added directly after the addition of labeled probe. DNA-protein complexes were resolved in 0.5 × TBE on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels.Fig. 5Sp1 and complex B competitively bind to the UGT1A8 Sp1/initiator-like region. A, double-stranded oligonucleotide probes (50,000 cpm) corresponding to the UGT1A8 Sp1/initiator-like region (wild-type and mutant) were incubated with 5 μg of Caco2 nuclear extracts and resolved on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. The two major complexes, A and B, are labeled with arrows. B, sequences of the sense strand of the oligonucleotide probes used in A are shown.

A, a promoter construct containing the proximal 55 bp of the UGT1A8 promoter was generated as described under ”Experimental Procedures.” A promoter construct of equal length containing a mutated upstream (5′) Sp1 site was generated as above using a forward primer with a 3-base mutation in the Sp1 site (1A8-55mut5′Sp1for; Table I). 0.5 μg of the wild-type and 5′-Sp1mutant promoter constructs was transfected into Caco2 cells with 0.025 μg of the pRL-null vector as an internal control of transfection efficiency. Cells were harvested 48 h post-transfection and assayed for firefly and Renilla luciferase activities. Relative luciferase activities are expressed as a -fold induction over the promoterless pGL3-basic vector (set at a value of 1). The results shown are a representative experiment of two individual experiments performed in triplicate (±S.D.). B, the UGT1A8/10 5′-Sp1 wild-type probe (50,000 cpm) was incubated with 5 μg of Caco2 nuclear extracts and resolved on a 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Unlabeled competitor oligonucleotides were added at a 50-fold molar excess before the addition of labeled probe. The Sp1 monoclonal antibody was added after the addition of labeled probe and incubated for 30 min before loading. The two major complexes, C and D, are labeled with arrows. C, sequences of the sense strand of the UGT1A8/10 5′-Sp1 wild-type and mutant (mut) probes are shown. Identical bases are marked with a dash, and the Sp1 mutation is indicated by the base changes. The 5′-Sp1 site is boxed.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Characterization of the UGT1A8, 1A9, and 1A10 Promoters— The promoter regions of the UGT1A8, 1A9, and 1A10 genes were isolated from a human placenta genomic library by screening with a UGT1A8 exon 1 probe. Several clones were selected and identified as containing the UGT1A8, 1A9, or 1A10 exon 1 by sequencing. Comparison of the proximal ∼1 kb of the UGT1A8, 1A9, and 1A10 promoters showed a high degree of sequence similarity (>75%) with several putative regulatory elements. Fig. 1 shows an alignment of the proximal 149 bases (UGT1A8 promoter relative to the ATG start codon) of each promoter, highlighting a conserved T-repeat region, two putative Sp1 binding sites (GC box), as well as several differences in nucleotide sequence. It has been suggested previously by Gong et al. (5Gong Q.H. Cho J.W. Huang T. Potter C. Gholami N. Basu N.K. Kubota S. Carvalho S. Pennington M.W. Owens I.S. Popescu N.C. Pharmacogenetics. 2001; 11: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) that the T-repeat region may function as a TATA box for the UGT1A8, 1A9, and 1A10 genes. To investigate this possibility, the transcription start sites of the genes were mapped using RNA ligase-mediated RACE to amplify only full-length capped transcripts. After the second round of PCR, which was specific for UGT1A8, 1A9, or 1A10, the amplified product was cloned into the pCR-Blunt vector and the sequence of several clones obtained. For the UGT1A8 gene, 10 clones were sequenced with two transcription start sites found at 46 (5 clones) and 49 (5 clones) bp from the ATG initiation codon (Fig. 1). Similarly, two separate transcription start sites were found for the UGT1A10 gene at 46 (10 clones) and 48 (10 clones) bp from the ATG initiation codon (Fig. 1). For the UGT1A9 gene, only one transcription start site was identified from 11 clones at 37 bp from the ATG initiation codon (Fig. 1). The position of the transcription start sites was >50 bp from the T-region, suggesting that an initiator-like mechanism, rather than a TATA-dependent mechanism, may be important in initiating UGT1A8, 1A9, and 1A10 transcription. Although canonical initiator sites (Py Py A+1 N T/A Py Py) (32Javahery R. Khachi A. Lo K. Zenzie-Gregory B. Smale S.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 116-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar) were not identified, an initiator-like region was found overlapping the 3′-putative Sp1 binding site in the three promoters (Fig. 1). Because the UGT1A8 and 1A10 promoters differ from the UGT1A9 promoter in four positions near the overlapping Sp1/initiator-like region, we decided to investigate whether this region bound nuclear proteins in EMSAs.

https://openalex.org/W2052846614,"Nitric oxide (NO) is a signal molecule produced in animals by three different NO synthases. Of these, only NOS I (neuronal nitric-oxide synthase; nNOS) is expressed as catalytically active N-terminally truncated forms that are missing either an N-terminal leader sequence required for protein-protein interactions or are missing the leader sequence plus three core structural motifs that in other NOS are required for dimer assembly and catalysis. To understand how the N-terminal elements impact nNOS structure-function, we generated, purified, and extensively characterized variants that were missing the N-terminal leader sequence (Δ296nNOS) or missing the leader sequence plus the three core motifs (Δ349nNOS). Eliminating the leader sequence had no impact on nNOS structure or catalysis. In contrast, additional removal of the core elements weakened but did not destroy the dimer interaction, slowed ferric heme reduction and reactivity of a hemedioxy intermediate, and caused a 10-fold poorer affinity toward substrate l-arginine. This created an nNOS variant with slower and less coupled NO synthesis that is predisposed to generate reactive oxygen species along with NO. Our findings help justify the existence of nNOS N-terminal splice variants and identify specific catalytic changes that create functional differences among them.

Dimerization creates an extensive interface between two oxygenase domains, creates high affinity binding sites for (6R)-tetrahydrobiopterin (H4B) and Arg in each oxygenase domain, and enables electrons to transfer between NOS flavin and heme groups (15Crane B.R.

Its gene generates multiple mRNA transcripts through mechanisms including alternative promoter usage, alternative splicing, cassette insertions/deletions, changing sites for 3′-untranslated region cleavage, and polyadenylation as well as allelic diversity in mRNA structure (24Wang Y. Marsden P.A. Adv. Pharmacol. 1995; 34: 71-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 25Wang Y. Newton D.C. Marsden P.A. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1999; 13: 21-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). For example, at least nine different exon 1 variants have been identified in the 5′ genomic regions of the human and rat nNOS genes (26Wang Y. Newton D.C. Robb G.B. Kau C.L. Miller T.L. Cheung A.H.

These mRNA variants enable expression of a single nNOS protein (wild-type or nNOSα) in a tissue-specific manner (26Wang Y. Newton D.C. Robb G.B. Kau C.L. Miller T.L. Cheung A.H. Hall A.V. VanDamme S.

Of particular interest are the gene expression alterations that produce N-terminally truncated nNOS enzymes, a phenomenon that is not observed among iNOS or eNOS (16Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Pitters E. Moloney M. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10609-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 29Ghosh D.K. Crane B.R. Ghosh S. Wolan D. Gachhui R. Crooks C. Presta A.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8530-8538Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For example, translation initiation within exon 1a gives rise to nNOSβ, which is missing the first 241 N-terminal amino acids (Fig. 1). The missing protein segment represents a N-terminal leader sequence that is unique to nNOS (Fig. 1) and contains PDZ/GLGF structural motifs that help direct nNOS to various protein compartments or complexes within cells (27Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). nNOSβ has a distinct tissue expression pattern (25Wang Y. Newton D.C. Marsden P.A. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1999; 13: 21-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), is predominantly located in the cell cytosol, and appears to have near wild-type NO synthesis activity (27Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). An alternative translation initiation that occurs in exon 5 (Met337) gives rise to nNOSγ, which lacks the first 336 N-terminal amino acids of wild-type nNOS (Fig. 1). The nNOSγ was reported to have low catalytic activity (3% of wild-type) in an in vitro assay (27Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar). Curiously, the human testis NOS (TnNOS) that is produced by alternative promoter usage was reported to have significant activity (31Wang Y. Goligorsky M.S. Lin M. Wilcox J.N. Marsden P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11392-11401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), although it is an exact homolog of nNOSγ (Fig. 1). A distinct tissue-specific expression was observed for either variant, implying discreet roles (25Wang Y. Newton D.C. Marsden P.A. Crit. Rev. Neurobiol. 1999; 13: 21-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). The TnNOS and nNOSγ enzymes are missing three structural motifs in addition to the N-terminal leader sequence. They represent a β-hairpin hook (termed the N-terminal hook), a CXXXC zinc-binding segment, and a segment that binds the 3-hydroxypropyl side chain of H4B (29Ghosh D.K. Crane B.R. Ghosh S. Wolan D. Gachhui R. Crooks C. Presta A. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6260-6270Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 32Crane B.R. Rosenfeld R.J. Arvai A.S. Ghosh D.K. Ghosh S. Tainer J.A. Stuehr D.J. Getzoff E.D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6271-6281Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). These three motifs help form the core oxygenase domain structure that is common in all animal NOS (Fig. 1). Both the N-terminal hook and Zn2+ binding motif are thought to be important for stabilizing the NOS dimer. Indeed, the N-terminal hook can swap position with its symmetry mate and thus create a larger dimer interface (29Ghosh D.K. Crane B.R. Ghosh S. Wolan D. Gachhui R. Crooks C. Presta A. Tainer J.A.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6271-6281Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), whereas Zn2+ binding to the CXXXC motif in each subunit covalently links two oxygenase domains (17Raman C.S. Li H. Martasek P.

Because the N-terminal splice variants of nNOS have all been active to varying degrees when overexpressed in animal cells (27Brenman J.E. Chao D.S. Gee S.H. McGee A.W. Craven S.E. Santillano D.R. Wu Z. Huang F. Xia H. Peters M.F. Froehner S.C. Bredt D.S. Cell. 1996; 84: 757-767Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1424) Google Scholar, 31Wang Y. Goligorsky M.S. Lin M. Wilcox J.N.

Our recent work on bacterial NOS-like proteins from Deinococcus radiodurans NOS (33Adak S. Bilwes A.M. Panda K. Hosfield D. Aulak K.S. McDonald J.F. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Crane B.R. Stuehr D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 107-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) or Bacillus subtilis NOS (34Adak S. Aulak K.S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 11071-11079Crossref PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) has shown that they are also catalytically active despite their missing the three core motifs (Fig. 1). Surprisingly, this characteristic of nNOS splice variants and the bacterial NOS-like proteins differs substantially from those of NOS II and NOS III, because in these latter two NOSs the three core motifs are practically essential for dimer formation and associated NO synthesis activity (16Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Pitters E. Moloney M. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10609-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 29Ghosh D.K. Crane B.R. Ghosh S. Wolan D. Gachhui R.

Ortiz de Montellano P.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8530-8538Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Together, the available data imply that underlying structure-function differences exist among the three NOSs despite their apparent structural congruence. However, little is known about the precise structural requirements of nNOS or why it is the only NOS isoform that is naturally expressed in N-terminally truncated forms. To explore these issues, we generated, purified, and extensively characterized two N-terminally deleted nNOS proteins, one missing the entire N-terminal leader sequence (Δ296nNOS) and the other missing the leader sequence plus the three core sequence motifs (Δ349nNOS) (29Ghosh D.K. Crane B.R. Ghosh S. Wolan D. Gachhui R. Crooks C. Presta A. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6260-6270Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 32Crane B.R. Rosenfeld R.J.

These particular deletion points represent trypsin-sensitive sites in the otherwise trypsin-resistant nNOS oxygenase domain dimer (nNOSoxy) (36Boyhan A. Smith D. Charles I.G. Saqi M. Lowe P.N. Biochem. J. 1997; 323: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1, the Δ296nNOS is analogous to the naturally occurring splice variant nNOSβ, whereas the Δ349nNOS is analogous to the naturally occurring nNOSγ and TnNOS splice variants in animals and to the bacterial NOS-like proteins B. subtilis NOS and D. radiodurans NOS. Our results reveal in detail how the N-terminal structural elements impact nNOS dimer assembly, cofactor/substrate affinity, and several fundamental kinetic and thermodynamic parameters that combine to control its NO synthesis. Reagents—All reagents and materials were obtained from Sigma or sources previously reported (29Ghosh D.K. Crane B.R. Ghosh S. Wolan D. Gachhui R. Crooks C. Presta A. Tainer J.A. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6260-6270Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 37Adak S. Santolini J. Tikunova S. Wang Q. Johnson J.D. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1244-1252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Molecular Biology—Restriction digestions, cloning, bacterial growth, transformation, and isolation of DNA fragments were performed using standard procedures. Deletion mutants of full-length rat nNOS, Δ296nNOSFL, and Δ349nNOSFL were constructed by PCR using 5′-end deletion primers incorporating a His6 tag at the N-terminal end, TTT TTT CAT ATG CAC CAC CAC CAC CAC CAC TGC CCC CGT TTC CTC AAG, for removing residues 1–296 and TTT TTT CAT ATG CAC CAC CAC CAC CAC CAC ACA AAG GAC CAG CTC TTC CC for removing residues 1–349. In both cases, the 3′-end primer GCT TGG CTG AGA ACT TGA CG was used to incorporate a SanDI unique site in the nNOSFL. PCR products and pCwori plasmid DNA were cut with NdeI at the 5′ end and SanDI at the 3′ end and then ligated at 14 °C overnight. The DNA sequence of all mutants was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing, and the expressed proteins were also checked by N-terminal protein sequencing at the Cleveland Clinic Molecular Biotechnology Core. Preparation of Wild-type nNOS, nNOSoxy, and Deletion Proteins— Wild-type nNOSFL and the Δ296 and Δ349 mutants contained a His6 tag attached to their N termini, whereas wild-type nNOSoxy had the His6 tag attached to its C terminus. All proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) using a modified pCwori vector (16Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Pitters E. Moloney M. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10609-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The full-length proteins were purified by sequential chromatography on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin and 2′,5′-ADP-Sepharose resin as described previously (38Adak S. Ghosh S. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22313-22320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). nNOSoxy was purified by chromatography on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resin followed by chromatography on Q-Sepharose anion exchange resin (16Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Pitters E. Moloney M. Werner E.R. Mayer B. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10609-10619Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The nNOSoxy eluted in the flow-through of the Q-Sepharose column using buffer containing 40 mm EPPS, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm Arg, and 0.13 m NaCl. The Δ296nNOSoxy and Δ349nNOSoxy were generated by incubating the above purified nNOSoxy with trypsin (100:1, w/w) for 1 and 11 min, respectively, at 25 °C, following which the reaction was stopped with trypsin inhibitor. Each cleaved nNOSoxy protein was isolated from its reaction mixture by chromatography on Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid. The ferrous CO adduct absorbing at 444 nm was used to quantitate heme protein content using an extinction coefficient of 74 mm–1 cm–1 (A 444–A 500). Gel Filtration Chromatography—The purified nNOS proteins (50 μg) were run on a 30 × 10-cm Superdex 200 HR column (Amersham Biosciences) as described before (22Panda K. Ghosh S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23349-23356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Arg and H4B Binding—Apparent Km values for Arg and H4B were derived through double reciprocal analysis of NADPH-dependent NO production rates observed at different concentrations of Arg or H4B at room temperature. Perturbation difference spectrometry was used to determine Kd of Arg according to methods described previously (39Gachhui R. Ghosh D.K. Wu C. Parkinson J. Crane B.R. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5097-5103Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). NO Synthesis, NADPH Oxidation, Ferricyanide Reduction, and Cytochrome c Reduction Activities—Steady state activities of wild-type and mutant nNOS were determined at 25 °C using spectrophotometric assays that were previously described in detail (38Adak S. Ghosh S. Abu-Soud H.M. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22313-22320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), after incubating each purified protein overnight on ice with 5 mm Arg and 10 μm H4B. Activities are reported on the basis of the measured dimer content of each protein. Where calcium-dependent NO synthesis was studied, activities were measured using 0–50 μm calcium chloride in three independent experiments. H2O2-driven NOHA Oxidation—Hydrogen peroxide-driven oxidation of NOHA to nitrite was assayed in 96-well microplates at 37 °C as described previously (22Panda K. Ghosh S. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23349-23356Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Final activities were calculated on the basis of the dimeric heme content of each protein. Kinetics of Enzyme Ferrous Heme-NO Complex Formation during the Initial Phase of NO Synthesis—Enzyme spectral transitions during the initial phase of NO synthesis were studied at 10 °C in the stopped flow spectrophotometer as previously described (40Adak S. Wang Q. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17434-17439Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Reactions were initiated by rapid mixing an air-saturated solution containing 50 μm NADPH with an air-saturated solution containing wild-type or mutant nNOS (2 μm), 40 mm EPPS buffer, pH 7.6, 10 μm H4B, 5 mm Arg, 0.3 mm DTT, 4 μm CaM, and 1 mm Ca2+. Buildup of the enzyme heme-NO complex was monitored at 436 nm. Signal/noise ratios were improved by averaging at least 10 individual mixing experiments. The time courses of absorbance change were best fit to a double exponential equation using a nonlinear least square method provided by the instrument manufacturer. Heme and Flavin Reduction—The kinetics of heme and flavin reduction were analyzed at 10 °C as described previously (37Adak S. Santolini J. Tikunova S. Wang Q. Johnson J.D. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 1244-1252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) using a stopped flow apparatus and diode array detector from Hi-Tech Ltd. (model SF-61) equipped for anaerobic analysis. Ferric heme reduction was followed by formation of the ferrous CO complex at 444 nm. Reactions were initiated by rapid mixing an anaerobic, buffered, CO-saturated solution containing 50 μm NADPH with an anaerobic, buffered, CO-saturated solution containing wild-type or mutant nNOS (2 μm), 40 mm EPPS buffer, pH 7.6, 10 μm H4B, 5 mm Arg, 0.3 mm DTT, 4 μm CaM, and 1 mm Ca2+. Flavin reduction was monitored under the same conditions at 485 nm. Signal/noise ratios were improved by averaging at least 10 individual mixing experiments. The time course of the absorbance change was fit to single or multiple exponential equations using a nonlinear least square method provided by the instrument manufacturer. Ferrous Heme-NO Oxidation—An anaerobic buffered solution containing each full-length nNOS enzyme (4 μm) plus 5 mm Arg and 10 μm H4B was reduced with a minimum amount of dithionite solution, and then a saturated NO solution was added to give a NO concentration of ∼0.1 mm and form the ferrous heme-NO enzyme complex. This solution was transferred to the stopped flow under anaerobic conditions and then rapidly mixed with air-saturated buffer solution at 10 °C. Rates of ferrous NO complex disappearance and ferric enzyme formation were determined from cross-sections of absorbance loss and gain at 436 and 393 nm, respectively. Single Turnover Analysis of Arg or NOHA Oxidation—These reactions were performed as previously described (41Boggs S. Huang L. Stuehr D.J. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2332-2339Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). An anaerobic solution of nNOSoxy enzyme (6 μm) containing 40 mm EPPS, pH 7.6, 1 mm DTT, and 2 mm NOHA or 5 mm Arg, with or without 20 μm H4B, was titrated with dithionite solution in an anaerobic cuvette until full reduction to ferrous nNOSoxy was achieved. The solution was then transferred to the stopped flow instrument using a gas-tight syringe, where it was rapidly mixed in multiple shots with an equal volume of oxygen-saturated buffer (50 mm EPPS, pH 7.6) at 10 °C. Ninety-six spectral scans (330–700 nm) were obtained following each mixing. The diode array data were then fit to different reaction models by a Specfit program from Hi-Tech Ltd. to obtain the calculated number of species, their individual spectra, the concentration of each species versus time, and rate constants for each transition. Measurement of Heme Midpoint Potential—The glass cell and electrodes used were as previously described (42Stankovich M.T. Anal. Biochem. 1980; 109: 295-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Spectroelectrochemical titration was performed at 25 °C using a Radiometer PGP201 potentiostat/galvanostat. The reference and auxiliary electrodes were made anaerobic overnight in a solution containing 0.5 mm methyl viologen, 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7. The reference electrode was calibrated using a 5 mm solution of ferricyanide/ferrocyanide in anaerobic 0.1 m potassium phosphate, pH 7, at 25 °C (Em = +425 mV). The Δ296nNOSoxy and Δ349nNOSoxy were diluted to a final concentration of about 25 μm in a 0.1 m potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7, in the presence of 60 μm H4B, 0.1 mm EDTA, 5 mm Arg, 0.1 mm methyl viologen, 20 μm phenosafranine, and 20 μm neutral red. The solution was rendered anaerobic in the electrochemical cell by N2 refilling over 2 h. The titration was achieved using the internal source of the radiometer set on the galvanostat mode for current ranging between 5 and 60 μA and times ranging between 15 s and 5 min. After each adjustment, the potential was allowed to equilibrate (between 30 min and 1 h), the potential was measured (versus SHE), and a spectrum was recorded on a Hitachi U-3110 spectrophotometer. The one-electron midpoint potential was determined using the absorbance change at 400 and 645 nm, where change due to dye mediators was negligible. The midpoint potential was calculated using the Nernst equation. Physical Characteristics of N-terminal Deletion Mutants— The full-length proteins Δ296nNOSFL and Δ349nNOSFL were generated by deletion mutagenesis, whereas corresponding nNOSoxy proteins were generated by limited trypsin proteolysis of purified nNOSoxy (43Panda K. Rosenfeld R.J. Ghosh S. Meade A.L. Getzoff E.D. Stuehr D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31020-31030Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 depicts SDS-PAGE and gel filtration profiles of the six proteins used in our study, namely wild-type nNOSoxy (A), Δ296nNOSoxy (B), Δ349nNOSoxy (C), wild-type nNOSFL (D), Δ296nNOSFL (E), and Δ349nNOSFL (F). Each protein migrated at its expected molecular weight in SDS-PAGE. N-terminal sequencing confirmed that each protein had the correct N-terminal truncation (data not shown). Gel filtration patterns showed that N-terminal deletions of 296 or 349 amino acids did not greatly alter the dimer content of the nNOSoxy proteins, given that even Δ349nNOSoxy remained 83% dimeric (Fig. 2, panel 2, profile C). The full-length proteins, however, had generally less dimer content compared with their oxygenase counterparts, consistent with our earlier observations that attached reductase domains weaken the dimeric interaction between two oxygenase domains (44Abu-Soud H.M.

We examined codon usage by the highly conserved residues, Ser-53 and Ser-56, of the shutter region and found a TCN-AGY usage dichotomy for Ser-56 that remarkably is linked to the protostome-deuterostome split. Our results suggest that serpin evolution was driven by phylogenetic speciation and not pressure to fulfill new physiologic functions mitigating against coevolution with the family of serine proteases they inhibit. The suicide inhibitory mechanism of serine protease inhibitors of the serpin superfamily depends heavily on their structural flexibility, which is controlled in large part by the breach and shutter regions of the central Aβ-sheet. We examined codon usage by the highly conserved residues, Ser-53 and Ser-56, of the shutter region and found a TCN-AGY usage dichotomy for Ser-56 that remarkably is linked to the protostome-deuterostome split. Our results suggest that serpin evolution was driven by phylogenetic speciation and not pressure to fulfill new physiologic functions mitigating against coevolution with the family of serine proteases they inhibit. The serpin superfamily features proteins that participate in a wide variety of physiologic and cellular functions ranging from blood clotting to molecular chaperoning (1Irving J.A. Pike R.N. Lesk A.M. Whisstock J.C. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1845-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The functional mechanism of the majority of serpins is suicide inhibition of serine proteases of clan PA, the chymotrypsin-like clan (2Potempa J. Korzus E. Travis J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15957-15960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Serpins have a diverse species distribution with members of the superfamily found in plants, viruses, archaea, nematodes, arthropods, and higher animals. Thus, serpins are similar to the class of proteases they inhibit in terms of their functional and species diversity. Unlike chymotrypsin-like proteases, however, inhibitory serpins require a high degree of conformational flexibility for normal function (3Whisstock J. Skinner R. Lesk A.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 63-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The inhibitor must be able to achieve a 70-Å translocation of the protease that is accompanied by significant structural changes (4Stratikos E. Gettins P.G.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4808-4813Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Disruption of this structural flexibility has been linked to a variety of disease states characterized by protease-antiprotease imbalance (5Stein P.E. Carrell R.W. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 96-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). The key role of conformational flexibility raises the possibility that the evolutionary history of the serpins is connected to regions of the molecule that are associated with maintaining flexibility. Discrete evolutionary markers, in the form of conserved amino acid residues that also display dichotomous sequence choices, have been used to reconstruct the evolutionary history of clan PA serine proteases (6Krem M.M. Di Cera E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3036-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Such markers can also be identified for the serpin superfamily to obtain phylogenetic information that extends beyond measurement of sequence similarity. The information obtained from those markers could reveal whether the evolution of serpins correlates with that of the proteases they inhibit. Here we search for discrete phylogenetic markers to address the roles of structural flexibility and coevolution with proteases in the evolutionary history of the serpin superfamily. Amino acid and nucleotide sequences of >200 serpins were culled from GenBank™ at www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Entrez. Genome sequences were translated and then aligned using ClustalW (7Thompson J.D. Higgins D.G. Gibson T.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 4673-4680Crossref PubMed Scopus (56002) Google Scholar) to identify the codons and amino acid choices for residues of interest. For calculation of protein distance matrices, nearly identical sequences were eliminated from alignments to minimize duplication. Non-inhibitory members of the serpin superfamily were also eliminated, leaving a pool of 74 serpins as the basis for subsequent calculations. Protein distances were calculated using PROTDIST from the PHYLIP package (8Felsenstein J. PHYLIP (Phylogeny Inference Package), version 3.5c. Department of Genetics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA1999Google Scholar). The serpin Paz1 of Hordeum vulgare was chosen as the root for evolutionary trees constructed using the Fitch-Margoliash method (9Fitch W.M. Margoliash E. Science. 1967; 155: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (2421) Google Scholar) using the PHYLIP program FITCH. Examination of protein sequence alignments identified residues Ser-53 and Ser-56 (α1-antitrypsin numbering) as potential evolutionary markers for the serpin superfamily. Ser-53 and Ser-56 are highly conserved residues located in the “shutter” region of the Aβ-sheet of the serpin fold (Fig. 1), which plays a key role in serpin conformational transitions (1Irving J.A. Pike R.N. Lesk A.M. Whisstock J.C. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1845-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 10Whisstock J.C. Skinner R. Carrell R.W. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 685-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Notably, the alignments did not indicate any other positions where a sequence usage dichotomy might serve as an evolutionary marker. Ser-53 is encoded almost exclusively by TCN codons. There is very limited use of Cys and Ala at this position. Both of these choices are one-nucleotide change from TCN, and Cys (encoded by TGY) is a possible intermediate in codon transitions between Ser:TCN and Ser:AGY. We did not encounter any sequences in which Ser-53 is encoded by an AGY codon. Although Cys-53 residues are evidence for the possibility of a TCN→ AGY transition at that position, such a transition has not yet occurred, suggesting unusually strong evolutionary pressure to maintain Ser at position 53. Ser-56 is characterized by a non-random TCN-AGY codon usage dichotomy (Table I). There are also instances of Gly, Asn, Thr, Val, and Cys at that position in 20% of the sequences. The Ser-56 codon usage dichotomy is linked to the protostome-deuterostome split. Sequences from nematodes and arthropods show TCN usage as do plant and viral serpins. However, sequences from chordates show AGY usage. Surprisingly, archaeal serpins also show AGY usage. There are few exceptions to the correlation of codon usage with animal species evolution. One serpin from Drosophila melanogaster and two serpins from the horseshoe crab show AGY usage, whereas one serpin from the urochordate Ciona intestinalis has TCN. Ser-56 appears to be a surprisingly informative evolutionary marker for serpins in that the TCN→ AGY transition associated with Ser-56 appears correlated with the evolution of deuterostome serpins away from protostome serpins.Table ICategories of serpinsSer-56:TCNAlaserpin (Manduca sexta), B25R (variola virus), bmserpin (B. malayi), CG-6717 (fly), CG-9455 (fly), CG-9460 (fly), GH21896 (fly), LP08647 (fly), LSDV149 (lumpy skin disease virus), Not2 (C. intestinalis), Paz1 (H. vulgare), phloem serpin (squash), SEP-LP (silkworm), serpin (sheep-pox virus), serpin (T. spiralis: AF231948), serpin (Trichostrongylus vitrinus), serpin-like (Arabadopsis thaliana: NM_128196, NM128081, NM_114391), serpin I-3 (camelpox virus), serpin WZS2 (wheat), serpin 1 (fly), serpin 1 (M. sexta), serpin 2 (fly), serpin 3 (fly), serpin 4 (fly), serpin 27a (fly), serpin 43Ac (fly), SPI-2 (vaccinia virus, rabbitpox virus), Spi 1A (Anopheles gambiae), Spi 1B (A. gambiae), Spi-2 (ectromelia virus), Spi 21F (A. gambiae), Spn 6 (fly), Spn 43Aa (fly), Srp-3 (C. elegans), Srp-6 (C. elegans), Srp-7 (C. elegans), V207 (cowpox virus)Ser-56:AGYAcrosomal serpin (human), α1-antichymotrypsin (mammals), α2-antiplasmin (mammals), anti-elastase (human), α2-antiplasmin-like (human), antithrombin III (vertebrates), α1-antitrypsin (vertebrates),aCarp: Arg-56:CGG. α1-antitrypsin-like (mouse, XM_112097),bAsn-56. α1-antitrypsin-like (mouse: XM_138234,bAsn-56.

Open table in a new tab The Ser-56 TCN-AGY dichotomy segregates the serpin superfamily into two lineages, referred to herein as the TCN and AGY lineages. The primordiality of TCN codons compared with AGY codons at conserved positions (11Diaz-Lazcoz Y. Henaut A. Vigier P. Risler J.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 123-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar, 12Trifonov E.N. Kirzhner A. Kirzhner V.M. Berezovsky I.N. J. Mol. Evol. 2001; 53: 394-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and the species segregation of the lineages indicate that the TCN lineage was older and gave rise to the AGY lineage. We used the method previously described for serine protease lineages (6Krem M.M. Di Cera E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3036-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) to identify the “parent inhibitor” (the modern inhibitor most similar to the putative ancestral inhibitor) for the AGY lineage. The serpin from Trichinella spiralis, a vertebrate parasite distantly related to the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, is the parent inhibitor for the AGY lineage. Using PROTDIST units, the serpin averages 1.56 distance units from AGY lineage inhibitors. Therefore, the T. spiralis serpin is the TCN lineage serpin most similar to the one(s) that gave rise to the AGY lineage. Although one would expect this serpin to be closely related to other nematode serpins, it is more similar to serpins from chordate and higher arthropod lineages. Despite the informative nature of Ser-56, a single sequence marker does not yield enough data for detailed insight into evolution of the serpins. Therefore, a phylogenetic tree of the serpin superfamily was constructed to determine whether the correlation between codon usage and speciation mapped to the primary sequence as well (Fig. 2). The tree was rooted using the plant serpin Paz1 from H. vulgare. The structure of the tree reflects the importance of speciation in serpin evolution. After plant sequences, nematode sequences diverge first followed by arthropod sequences. Viral serpins diverge next, finally followed by chordate serpins. Thus, the TCN-AGY dichotomy maps neatly onto the tree. The viral serpins, parent inhibitors for the AGY lineage, diverge before the AGY serpins and after the other TCN serpins. Qualitatively similar phylogenetic trees have been obtained previously (1Irving J.A. Pike R.N. Lesk A.M. Whisstock J.C. Genome Res. 2000; 10: 1845-1864Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar, 13Atchley W.R. Lokot T. Wollenberg K. Dress A. Ragg H. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2001; 18: 1502-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) but included smaller numbers of TCN-lineage serpins than used in this study. Together, this new dendrogram and the codon data mutually reinforce each other and point toward a heavy focus on speciation during the course of serpin evolution. It should also be noted that superpositions of dendrograms for the S1 family of chymotrypsin-like proteases (14Krem M.M. Rose T. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28063-28066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) upon those for the serpin superfamily do not match proteases with their respective inhibitors. Neither dendrogramatic analysis (14Krem M.M. Rose T. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28063-28066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) nor analysis of evolutionary markers (6Krem M.M. Di Cera E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3036-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) points toward a significant correlation between speciation and the evolution of the chymotrypsin-like serine proteases. The evolutionary histories of the proteases and their inhibitors seem to be independent. Comparison of codon usage by the nearly absolutely (>90%) conserved Ser residues Ser-53 of serpins and the active site Ser-195 of serine proteases indicates that serpins followed a more conservative evolutionary pathway. Ser-53 has stead-fastly retained TCN codon usage, whereas the evolutionary history of Ser-195 reveals more than one possible TCN→ AGY transition (6Krem M.M. Di Cera E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3036-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). This is also reflected in the distance matrices used to generate evolutionary trees and identify “parent inhibitors.” The average distance in the serpin matrix is 1.73, whereas the average distance in the protease matrix (14Krem M.M. Rose T. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28063-28066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) is 2.20. Thus, the serpins are more similar to each other and are more parsimonious with regard to sequence changes. Phylogenetically, serpins group according to species and not function, unlike the proteases (14Krem M.M. Rose T. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28063-28066Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 15Rose T. Di Cera E. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 19243-19246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The main driving force behind serpin evolution was therefore the emergence of new phyla. Within phyla, functionally dissimilar proteins may share significant sequence similarity. Serpins may reflect a picture of the protease world that existed before the major functional radiation of the proteases. The correlation between Ser-56 codon usage and speciation is part of a larger trend in which AGY codons have become utilized in greater numbers during the course of species evolution based on codon usage frequencies tabulated from sequence databases (16Nakamura Y. Gojobori T. Ikemura T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2000; 28: 292Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Codon usage at Ser-56 is linked to a species' relative AGY content as is phylogeny. Deuterostomes utilize AGY codons in greater numbers than plants, viruses, or other species (Table II). This constitutes further evidence on the phylogenetic level that TCN was the primordial serine codon.Table IIComparison of representative species and overall Ser codon usageSpecies% Total Ser codons that are AGYSer-56 codon in serpinsA. thaliand28.4TCNH. vulgare33.3TCNC. elegans25.4TCNB. malayi32.3TCNM. sexta31.2TCNA. gambiae36.3TCNT. spiralis31.3TCNC. intestinalis33.7TCNCowpox virus28.0TCNVariola virus27.2TCND. melanogaster aIncluded in analysis of AGY and TCN groups.38.5TCN and AGYS. japonicum32.9AGYNostoc species41.0AGYM. mazei31.9AGYM. acetivorans33.0AGYHorseshoe crabbCombination of Limulus polyphemus and Tachypleus tridentatus species.34.4AGYMouse39.2AGYHuman39.0AGYRat37.7AGYCow38.2AGYLamprey33.8AGYSpecies with Ser-56:TCN31.4 ± 4.0cAverage % AGY.0.004dp value.Species with Ser-56:AGY36.3 ± 3.2cAverage % AGY.0.004dp value.Protostomes and non-animal species32.3 ± 4.2cAverage % AGY.0.022dp value.Deuterostomes36.9 ± 2.5cAverage % AGY.0.022dp value.a Included in analysis of AGY and TCN groups.b Combination of Limulus polyphemus and Tachypleus tridentatus species.c Average % AGY.d p value. Open table in a new tab Ser-53 and Ser-56 are located within a cluster of conserved residues within the shutter region of the serpin fold. The shutter is centrally located and lies at the intersection of the major secondary structural elements of the Aβ-sheet. Along with the breach, the shutter facilitates sheet opening and accepts the conserved hinge of the reactive center loop, which in turn permits translocation of the protease from one pole of the serpin to the other (10Whisstock J.C. Skinner R. Carrell R.W. Lesk A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 2000; 296: 685-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The evolutionary importance of the shutter in serpin evolution is underscored by the ability of shutter mutations to cause protein malfunctions that result in human disease. The S53F mutant of α1-antitrypsin causes inappropriate polymerization and the formation of inclusion bodies, leading to liver disease and emphysema (17Seyama K. Nukiwa T. Takabe K. Takahashi H. Miyake K. Kira S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 12627-12632Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Lomas D.A. Finch J.T. Seyama K. Nukiwa T. Carrell R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15333-15335Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The S53P and S56R mutants of neuroserpin also polymerize, leading to pre-senile familial dementia (19Davis R.L. Shrimpton A.E. Holohan P.D. Bradshaw C. Feiglin D. Collins G.H. Sonderegger P. Kinter J. Becker L.M. Lacbawan F. Krasnewich D. Muenke M. Lawrence D.A. Yerby M.S. Shaw C.M. Gooptu B. Elliott P.R. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Nature. 1999; 401: 376-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A variety of inhibitory serpins do not use Ser at position 56. This residue is not universally crucial for serpin function. Whereas S56R is devastating in neuroserpin, Arg-56 is the wild-type residue in carp α1-antitrypsin. Ser-56 per se appears significantly less crucial for conformational flexibility than Ser-53. The importance of Ser-56 hinges on differential codon usage. Ser-56 is a useful evolutionary marker because it is located in a key region and is sufficiently conserved such that the TCN-AGY dichotomy provides meaningful information. The TCN→ AGY transition tied to Ser-56 demonstrates that additional non-silent sequence changes were taking place within the shutter region as deuterostome serpins evolved. The three-way correlation of phylogenetic trees, Ser-56 codon usage, and speciation indicates that Ser-56 is a sensitive barometer for changes occurring throughout the serpin sequence and that those changes are closely associated with species evolution. Perhaps the most surprising aspect is that TCN-lineage inhibitors were not retained by chordates but were simply replaced by AGY-lineage inhibitors. Proteases do not display a similar pattern of species-specific evolution. In chordates, primordial-lineage proteases such as trypsin and chymotrypsin have been retained alongside modern-lineage proteases such as thrombin and protein C (6Krem M.M. Di Cera E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3036-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). TCN-lineage inhibitors, which predate the protostome-deuterostome divergence, may have some utility within a chordate molecular environment as evidenced by their retention by the parasite T. spiralis and the pox viruses. Deuterostome serpins and closely related protostome serpins from parasites are likely to share a common ancestor according to the dendrogram in Fig. 2. T. spiralis and the pox viruses may have obtained their TCN-lineage serpins by horizontal transmission from protostome hosts that were similar to those from which the deuterostomes evolved. This hypothesis helps explain the parent inhibitor role of the T. spiralis serpin and the similarity of pox virus serpins to the deuterostome serpins. Horseshoe crab serpins are AGY-lineage unlike other protostome serpins, which suggests that arthropod AGY-lineage serpins were also similar to the protostome TCN-lineage serpins that gave rise to deuterostome AGY-lineage serpins. The ancestor of the AGY-lineage serpins may have been associated with a primitive arthropod hemolymph-clotting system. The limulus intracellular coagulation inhibitor serpins belong to the AGY lineage unlike most arthropod serpins, implying that a TCN→ AGY transition was associated with the development of hemolymph clotting. TCN→ AGY transitions also occurred at the serine protease residues Ser-195 and Ser-214 to give rise to horseshoe crab clotting factor C, a modern-lineage protease that initiates the hemolymph-clotting cascade. Serpin and protease TCN→ AGY transitions might have occurred contemporaneously, raising the possibility of limited coevolution of serpins and proteases in the development of clotting cascades. The two archaeal serpins identified in this study belonging to Methanosarcina species appear to belong to the AGY lineage. Given the extreme metabolic profile of Methanosarcina, it is unlikely that such a species pathogenized a deuterostome and obtained AGY-lineage serpins by lateral transfer. Phylogenetic trees indicate that archaea diverged from the eukarya prior to the divergence of plants, animals, and protists (20Olsen G.J. Woese C.R. Cell. 1997; 89: 991-994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar, 21Brown J.R. Syst. Biol. 2001; 50: 497-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar), which would have pre-dated the emergence of the ancestor of deuterostome AGY-lineage serpins. Therefore, it seems that the Methanosarcina serpins belong to a distinct AGY lineage. A similar phenomenon was observed for several archaeal acylpeptide hydrolases (clan SC, family S9). Those proteases occupy the most modern possible evolutionary category for clan SC, whereas eukaryotic proteases of the same family have not yet evolved to occupy that category (6Krem M.M. Di Cera E. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3036-3045Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). The extreme environmental pressures faced by archaea were the likely evolutionary driving force behind the sequence change. The phenomenon of AGY-lineage archaeal serpins underscores the particularly important role of speciation in serpin evolution. At the functional level, new phylogenetic lineages of serpins evolved as members of the superfamily faced the challenges posed by the increasingly complex molecular environments of emerging phyla. At the sequence level, the shutter region remained a stable bastion of highly conserved residues that changed only in response to the most severe evolutionary pressures. The arrival of the diverse protease environment of the deuterostomes provided sufficient evolutionary tumult to change the shutter region, documented quietly by the appearance of AGY codons to encode Ser-56."
https://openalex.org/W2033003569,"Hyperoxia induces growth arrest, apoptosis, necrosis, and morphological changes (spreading and adhesion) in various types of cells. The mechanism of hyperoxia-induced cell growth arrest has not been well elucidated, especially in macrophages. One possible mechanism is a role of cell adhesion in hyperoxia-induced cell cycle arrest. To evaluate this finding, macrophages were cultured in normoxia (21% O2) or hyperoxia (95% O2) in adhesion or low adhesion conditions. Incubation of macrophages in hyperoxia induced cell cycle arrest. The hyperoxia-induced cell cycle arrest was prevented by low adhesion conditions. To evaluate pathways potentially involved in hyperoxia-induced growth arrest, we measured extracellular regulated kinase and retinoblastoma protein activation and p21Cip1 and p53 accumulation. Hyperoxia strongly induced activation of extracellular regulated kinase and retinoblastoma protein as well as up-regulation of p21Cip1. These effects of hyperoxia were attenuated under low adhesion conditions, suggesting a role for integrin-dependent signaling. The induction of p21Cip1 and activation of retinoblastoma protein occurred via a p53-independent mechanism. These results suggest that adhesion-dependent pathways are required for hyperoxia-induced cell cycle arrest in macrophages."

In Ile<sup>279</sup> → Ala and Ile<sup>283</sup> → Ala, the <i>E</i> <sub>1</sub> form accumulated, whereas in His<sup>285</sup> → Lys and His<sup>285</sup> → Glu, <i>E</i> <sub>1</sub>P accumulated. Phe<sup>286</sup> → Ala displaced the conformational equilibria of dephosphoenzyme and phosphoenzyme in parallel in favor of <i>E</i> <sub>2</sub> and <i>E</i> <sub>2</sub>P, respectively, and showed a unique enhancement of the <i>E</i> <sub>1</sub>P → <i>E</i> <sub>2</sub>P transition rate. These effects suggest that M3 undergoes significant rearrangements in relation to <i>E</i> <sub>1</sub>–<i>E</i> <sub>2</sub> and <i>E</i> <sub>1</sub>P–<i>E</i> <sub>2</sub>P conformational changes. Because the <i>E</i> <sub>1</sub>–<i>E</i> <sub>2</sub> and <i>E</i> <sub>1</sub>P–<i>E</i> <sub>2</sub>P conformational equilibria were differentially affected by some of the mutations, the phosphorylated conformations seem to differ significantly from the dephospho forms in the M3 region. Mutation of His<sup>285</sup> furthermore increased the Na<sup>+</sup>-activated ATPase activity in the absence of K<sup>+</sup> (""Na<sup>+</sup>-ATPase activity""). Ile<sup>279</sup> → Ala, Ile<sup>283</sup> → Ala, and His<sup>288</sup> → Ala showed reduced Na<sup>+</sup> affinity of the <i>E</i> <sub>1</sub> form. The rate of Na<sup>+</sup>-activated phosphorylation from ATP was reduced in Ile<sup>279</sup> → Ala and Ile<sup>283</sup> → Ala, and these mutants showed evidence similar to Glu<sup>329</sup> → Gln of destabilization of the Na<sup>+</sup>-occluded state."
